They do it for a long time.	Wɔyɛ no bere tenten.
Work went on quickly.	Adwuma kɔɔ so ntɛmntɛm.
I understand completely.	Mete ase koraa.
I want to be that guy someday.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa ɔbarima no da bi.
At a party.	Wɔ apontow bi ase.
Don’t tell him about me.	Nka me ho asɛm nkyerɛ no.
There is nothing more difficult.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ den sen saa.
I didn’t know about all that.	Ná minnim saa nneɛma no nyinaa ho asɛm.
For me, that doesn’t work.	Wɔ me fam no, ɛno nyɛ adwuma.
The first part of the plan had worked.	Ná nhyehyɛe no fã a edi kan no ayɛ adwuma.
Part of me wants that more.	Me fã bi pɛ saa kɛse.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He nodded slightly.	Ɔde ne ti too fam kakra.
I'm the only one who thinks about it.	Me nkutoo na misusuw ho.
Let it be so.	Ma ɛnyɛ saa.
Something had lifted it.	Ná biribi ama so.
Like he doesn’t know you.	Te sɛ nea onnim wo.
One is the food he lives on.	Biako ne aduan a ɔde tra ase.
I saw you right away.	Mihuu wo so ntɛm ara.
Look how beautiful you are tonight.	Hwɛ sɛnea wo ho yɛ fɛ anadwo yi.
There was a lot of excitement.	Ná anigye kɛse bi wɔ hɔ.
Just the other morning.	Anɔpa a atwam no ara pɛ.
What you don’t do.	Nea wonyɛ.
It’s very obvious.	Ɛda adi yiye.
However, implementing this system is time-consuming.	Nanso, saa nhyehyɛe yi a wɔde bedi dwuma no gye bere pii.
Such a thing is impossible.	Ade a ɛte saa no ntumi nyɛ yiye.
The first day of the.	Da a edi kan no.
I couldn’t understand what was going on there.	Ná mintumi nte nea na ɛrekɔ so wɔ hɔ no ase.
He touched the door handle.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ɔpon no nsa.
However, it is time well spent.	Nanso, ɛyɛ bere a wɔde di dwuma yiye.
You can’t say she’s beautiful.	Worentumi nka sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It wasn’t very good anyway.	Na ɛnyɛ papa koraa ɔkwan biara so.
He obviously enjoys socializing.	Ɛda adi sɛ n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔne nkurɔfo bɛbɔ.
That’s the real stuff it’s made of.	Ɛno ne ade ankasa a wɔde ayɛ no.
But he will do it.	Nanso ɔbɛyɛ saa.
Just his hands.	Ne nsa ara kwa.
The price was also terrible.	Ná ne bo nso yɛ hu.
But you are a man.	Nanso woyɛ ɔbarima.
I’m just glad you can find the time.	M’ani agye kɛkɛ sɛ wubetumi anya bere no.
It’s your money.	Ɛyɛ wo sika.
The system is there.	Nhyehyɛe no wɔ hɔ.
The phone rings.	Telefon no bɔ.
You know how honest he is.	Wunim sɛnea odi nokware.
Many languages.	Kasa pii.
I loved being a part of it.	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ ne fã.
I would tell them about the door.	Ná meka ɔpon no ho asɛm kyerɛ wɔn.
He established a new one.	Ɔde foforo sii hɔ.
That statement is false, false, false.	Saa asɛm no yɛ atoro, atoro, atoro.
A picture below shows my setup.	Mfonini bi a ɛwɔ ase ha no kyerɛ me nhyehyɛe.
First, look at the ingredients.	Nea edi kan no, hwɛ nneɛma a wɔde yɛ aduan no.
That’s why it’s always so hot.	Ɛno nti na ɛyɛ hyew saa bere nyinaa no.
Everyone said it was too scary.	Obiara kae sɛ ɛyɛ hu dodo.
I don't know what's wrong with this.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ bɔne wɔ eyi ho.
Hopefully it’s not a big deal.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse.
It is very unlikely that it will be used as such.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛda adi koraa sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma saa.
This is a happy time for us.	Eyi yɛ anigye bere ma yɛn.
Him being one of my best friends.	Ɔno a ɔyɛ me nnamfo paa no mu biako.
We all do them every day.	Yɛn nyinaa yɛ wɔn da biara da.
And that would increase the risk.	Na ɛno bɛma asiane no ayɛ kɛse.
No time for that now.	Bere biara nni hɔ mma ɛno mprempren.
This is not true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware.
He seemed to be in a state of shock.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho ayɛ no hyew.
You may not even know.	Ebia wunnim mpo.
Sorry for one dinner.	Pa kyɛw anwummere aduan biako.
It’s really scary.	Ɛyɛ hu ankasa.
It is a very difficult task.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den yiye.
They were very bad.	Ná wɔyɛ bɔne paa.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛte saa.
Of course, he has a much more powerful way.	Ampa, ɔwɔ ɔkwan a tumi wom sen saa koraa.
But there was no time to talk about this.	Nanso na bere nni hɔ a wɔde bɛka eyi ho asɛm.
One for the background image.	Biako ma mfonini a ɛwɔ akyi no.
Which he was, in the end.	Nea na ɔyɛ, wɔ awiei no.
This dish is amazing.	Saa aduan yi yɛ nwonwa.
This would obviously take some time.	Ɛda adi sɛ na eyi begye bere kakra.
The ingredients are simple.	Nneɛma a wɔde yɛ no yɛ mmerɛw.
I wanted to go there and miss them.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ na mepɛ wɔn yiye.
Not in his nature.	Ɛnyɛ ne su mu.
The moon was full the last time it was here.	Ná ɔsram no ayɛ ma bere a etwa to a na ɛwɔ ha no.
Look at your eyes.	Hwɛ w’ani so.
The child was very comfortable.	Abofra no ho tɔɔ no yiye.
This went better than last time.	Eyi kɔɔ yiye sen bere a etwaam no.
I played with one for a while.	Mede biako dii agoru bere tiaa bi.
That way, you can do whatever you want to do.	Saa kwan no so no, wubetumi ayɛ biribiara a wopɛ sɛ woyɛ.
But nothing came to him.	Nanso biribiara amma ne nkyɛn.
Only you can see him.	Wo nkutoo na wubetumi ahu no.
It didn’t feel like anyone was there.	Na ɛnyɛ te sɛ nea obi wɔ hɔ.
It shouldn’t be long.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ tenten.
No one had any money.	Ná obiara nni sika biara.
I could barely get to his bed.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nkɔ ne mpa so.
So should his.	Saa ara na ɛsɛ sɛ ne de nso.
But it doesn’t seem to be.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛnte saa.
It was a morning like this.	Ná ɛyɛ anɔpa bi te sɛ eyi.
I would have done that.	Anka mɛyɛ saa.
Can you attend the meeting?	So wubetumi akɔ nhyiam no ase?
What a dog this is.	Ɔkraman bɛn ara ni.
Most of the time, he’s happy.	Mpɛn pii no, n’ani gye.
All in all, good work.	Ne nyinaa mu no, adwuma pa.
It’s going to the door.	Ɛrekɔ ɔpon no ano.
I'm afraid next year.	Me suro afe a edi hɔ no.
But it’s an old story and probably not true.	Nanso ɛyɛ asɛm dedaw bi na ebia ɛnyɛ nokware.
I like that too.	M’ani gye saa nso ho.
That’s awesome!	Ɛno yɛ hu!
No one else really.	Obi foforo biara ankasa.
There is no reason to do so.	Biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
I want to be with him more.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no bɔ kɛse.
I can handle that.	Metumi adi saa asɛm no ho dwuma.
I have a plan.	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe bi.
I have a lot of things to do.	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
My bed is calling my name.	Me mpa no rebɔ me din.
At least not in a good way.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ ɔkwan pa so.
It sounds too simple, but it works.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo, nanso ɛyɛ adwuma.
It was to be implemented in three years.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma wɔ mfe abiɛsa mu.
Two phones to take with you.	Telefon abien a ɛsɛ sɛ wode kɔ.
Meeting for lunch.	Nhyiam a wɔyɛ ma awia aduan.
You can’t work for nothing.	Worentumi nyɛ adwuma kwa.
Which most of them needed.	Nea na wɔn mu dodow no ara hia.
Even now he might be doing so.	Mprempren mpo ebia na ɔreyɛ saa.
Books are great for learning.	Nhoma yɛ kɛse ma adesua.
Not his wife.	Ɛnyɛ ne yere.
I hope he has done so.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wayɛ saa.
Anything can happen, you know.	Biribiara betumi asi, wunim.
Talk to you then.	Kasa kyerɛ wo saa bere no.
But don’t go.	Nanso nkɔ.
It’s been a long night.	Ɛyɛ anadwo tenten bi.
I'm just a real person.	Meyɛ obi ankasa kɛkɛ.
Maybe someone can guide me or maybe help me.	Ebia obi betumi akyerɛ me kwan anaasɛ ebia ɔbɛboa me.
Believe me, we will work on it.	Gye me di, yɛbɛyɛ ho adwuma.
He glanced to the side.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ nkyɛn.
The house was absolutely beautiful.	Ná ofie no yɛ fɛ koraa.
So were the kids.	Saa ara na na mmofra no nso te.
A letter was posted.	Wɔde krataa bi too hɔ.
Behind them, it’s just us.	Wɔ wɔn akyi no, ɛyɛ yɛn nkutoo.
Or a bad guy.	Anaasɛ ɔbarima bɔne.
And.	Ne.
Narrative qualitative studies.	Asɛm a wɔka fa su ho adesua.
This or nothing.	Eyi anaasɛ biribiara nni hɔ.
They generally work well.	Mpɛn pii no, wɔyɛ adwuma yiye.
However, these costs are quite high.	Nanso, saa ka ahorow yi yɛ kɛse koraa.
It’s only going well.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so yiye nkutoo.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
The feel of his hands on her.	Sɛnea ne nsa te nka wɔ ne so no.
He seemed capable of anything at the time.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obetumi ayɛ biribiara saa bere no.
I had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
It was more of an idea.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene bi kɛse.
But there is more to it than just the plan.	Nanso pii wɔ mu sen nhyehyɛe no ara kwa.
This dress is very expensive.	Saa atade yi bo yɛ den yiye.
There were no signatures.	Ná obiara nni hɔ a wɔde wɔn nsa ahyɛ ase.
Time will be of the essence for them now.	Bere bɛyɛ nea ɛho hia wɔn mprempren.
Children should not work like that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ mmofra yɛ adwuma saa.
The process is complex.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ no yɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
He did well, by the way.	Ɔyɛɛ yiye, ɔkwan bi so no.
Other than that, it should work.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
In the end, the kids loved it.	Awiei koraa no, na mmofra no ani agye ho.
The problem is, it was us.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ, na ɛyɛ yɛn.
They both looked at the girl.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa hwɛɛ abeawa no.
Cops are human too!	Polisifo nso yɛ nnipa!
Just not with me.	Ɛnyɛ me nkyɛn kɛkɛ.
And they were, indeed.	Na na wɔyɛ, ampa.
He was the only one who didn’t have one.	Ɔno nkutoo na na onni bi.
There is still much to be done.	Nneɛma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
I know this for sure.	Minim eyi ampa.
Not for the first time, you know.	Ɛnyɛ nea edi kan no, wunim.
It 's amazing	Ɛyɛ nwonwa .
Which I just couldn’t eat.	Nea na mintumi nni kɛkɛ.
See me after class.	Hwɛ me wɔ adesua akyi.
Put your name on it all.	Fa wo din to so nyinaa.
It wasn’t like he had a big group of friends.	Na ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔwɔ nnamfo kuw kɛse bi.
You know how nice they all are, down there.	Wunim sɛnea wɔn nyinaa yɛ fɛ, wɔ fam hɔ.
That he didn’t want to understand.	Sɛ na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔte ase.
This is, to me, a problem.	Eyi yɛ, wɔ me fam no, ɔhaw.
I forget what it is.	Me werɛ fi nea ɛyɛ.
I need to sleep, but I can’t.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda, nanso mintumi.
But he was quite young.	Nanso na ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
This would be perfect.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ nea edi mũ.
Not everyone can do it.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na obetumi ayɛ.
It’s just too hard.	Ɛyɛ den dodo ara kwa.
The same number of things.	Nneɛma dodow koro no ara.
But it doesn’t matter to me.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia me.
But the letter made him stronger.	Nanso krataa no maa ne ho yɛɛ den.
Or you can have anything.	Anaasɛ wubetumi anya biribiara.
That will always be true.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nokware bere nyinaa.
Nothing was good.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na eye.
This car is really fast.	Saa kar yi yɛ ntɛmntɛm ankasa.
But they really focused on his feet.	Nanso wɔde wɔn adwene sii ne nan so ankasa.
It just wasn’t true.	Ná ɛnyɛ nokware ara kwa.
They all need to understand.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn nyinaa te ase.
But that is not true.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ nokware.
This is a false statement.	Eyi yɛ atoro nsɛm.
Test, test, test.	Sɔhwɛ, sɔhwɛ, sɔhwɛ.
I don’t know if that will do the job, but it probably will.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma no anaa, nanso ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Look outside.	Hwɛ abɔnten so.
We are made of the same stuff.	Wɔde nneɛma koro no ara na ɛyɛ yɛn.
This is your group.	Eyi ne wo kuw no.
But he doesn’t know any of that.	Nanso onnim saa nneɛma no mu biara.
I have to say it was quite good.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ na ɛyɛ papa koraa.
Just keep things simple.	Ma nneɛma nyɛ mmerɛw kɛkɛ.
This book is amazing for its concept.	Saa nhoma yi yɛ nwonwa wɔ adwene a ɛwɔ mu no ho.
It was too late anyway.	Ná aka akyi dodo ɔkwan biara so.
So something went wrong.	Enti biribi anyɛ yiye.
There seemed to be nothing else to do.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
All he could do.	Nea na obetumi ayɛ nyinaa.
I knew immediately that he had nothing.	Ná minim ntɛm ara sɛ onni hwee.
It currently works for me.	Mprempren ɛyɛ adwuma ma me.
And his eyes.	Na n’ani.
That’s huge these days.	Ɛno yɛ kɛse nnansa yi.
My dog ​​is kicking me all the time!	Me kraman no rebɔ me bere nyinaa!
Without music, he had nothing.	Sɛ nnwom nni hɔ a, na onni hwee.
This is it!.	Eyi ne no!.
Everyone knew him.	Ná obiara nim ne ho.
Their new apartment had a new room.	Ná wɔn dan foforo no wɔ dan foforo.
It’s not a bad city.	Ɛnyɛ kurow bɔne.
Hours and hours of work.	Nnɔnhwerew ne nnɔnhwerew a wɔde yɛ adwuma.
There! 	Hɔ!
It’s not really an easy thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
And he has done so very well.	Na wayɛ saa paa.
It is not so now.	Ɛnte saa mprempren.
However, it is important.	Nanso, ɛho hia.
What this means is unclear.	Nea eyi kyerɛ no mu nna hɔ.
That’s the point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no.
Not great, but not terrible.	Ɛnyɛ kɛse, nanso ɛnyɛ hu.
It seems that.	Ɛte sɛ nea.
I thought you did too.	Misusuwii sɛ wo nso woyɛ saa.
We have that moment again.	Yɛwɔ saa bere no bio.
I set the scene.	Mede tebea no sii hɔ.
That really surprised me.	Ɛno yɛɛ me nwonwa ankasa.
That’s the way it is.	Ɛno ne ɔkwan no.
You're too quick.	Woayɛ ntɛm dodo.
This was too important.	Ná eyi ho hia dodo.
He is a real person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔwɔ hɔ ankasa.
That was our home.	Ná ɛno ne yɛn fie.
This book is my favorite so far.	Saa nhoma yi ne nea m’ani gye ho kɛse de besi nnɛ.
We can’t do it without your help.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ sɛ mo mmoa nka ho.
Just give it time.	Ma no bere kɛkɛ.
I love this time of year.	M’ani gye afe no mu bere yi ho.
If he had to stick up for her.	Sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho hyɛ ne so a.
I admire the man.	M’ani gye ɔbarima no ho.
I can’t get any.	Mintumi nnya bi.
It’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
What a joy that is.	Hwɛ anigye ara a ɛno yɛ.
Maybe he just had nowhere else to go.	Ebia na onni baabi foforo biara a ɔbɛkɔ kɛkɛ.
The same goes for the windows.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ mfɛnsere no ho.
His hands clenched tightly.	Ne nsa bɔɔ denneennen.
I hope it doesn’t.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
He wants what he likes best.	Ɔpɛ nea n’ani gye ho kɛse.
I wish that would happen soon.	Me yam a anka ɛno bɛba nnansa yi ara.
He sits there in the water.	Ɔte hɔ wɔ nsu no mu.
We had food, water.	Ná yɛwɔ aduan, nsu.
The plan should be made available to all stakeholders.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde nhyehyɛe no ma wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu nyinaa.
I wish that were true.	Me yam a anka ɛno yɛ nokware.
This is the first time it has ever happened.	Eyi ne bere a edi kan a asi pɛn.
That was very painful.	Ɛno yɛɛ yaw kɛse.
I'm sorry for you.	Mepa wo kyɛw.
He was a great guy.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse.
Jobs are not needed here.	Nnwuma ho nhia wɔ ha.
And you’ve done it right.	Na woayɛ no yiye.
So he doesn’t know how you are.	Enti onnim sɛnea wo ho te.
So you may have some problems or new work to do.	Enti ebia wowɔ ɔhaw ahorow bi anaa adwuma foforo a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
He was on me at the time.	Ná ɔwɔ me so saa bere no.
It works on everything.	Ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ biribiara so.
People still talk about it.	Nkurɔfo da so ara ka ho asɛm.
Some of that already exists.	Ɛno bi wɔ hɔ dedaw.
Look at his feet.	Hwɛ ne nan.
But people hardly ever see my mother.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nkurɔfo nhu me maame da.
That will definitely make things better.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno bɛma nneɛma ayɛ yiye.
So it must be true.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
Why we use this.	Nea enti a yɛde eyi di dwuma.
However, we get used to them after a while.	Nanso, yɛyɛ wɔn su bere tiaa bi akyi.
He told me to do that.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ menyɛ saa.
But the rest hurt.	Nanso nea aka no yɛɛ me yaw.
These shoes are made of leather.	Wɔde aboa nhoma na ɛyɛ mpaboa yi.
This goes into effect today.	Eyi fi ase yɛ adwuma nnɛ.
But it’s not easy to do that.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
I don’t want anything to do with them.	Mempɛ sɛ me ne wɔn bɛyɛ hwee.
But not for very long.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bere tenten pii.
If you can follow that.	Sɛ wubetumi adi ɛno akyi a.
A part of something.	Biribi fã bi.
The clothes there were expensive.	Ná ntade a ɛwɔ hɔ no bo yɛ den.
What can we expect.	Dɛn na yebetumi ahwɛ kwan.
How it all comes back to me.	Sɛnea ne nyinaa san ba me so.
What an effort this must take.	Mmɔden bɛn ara na ɛsɛ sɛ eyi gye no.
He is very short.	Ɔyɛ tiaa koraa.
Why do you want to do this?	Dɛn nti na wopɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi?
That’s just the bottom line.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛwɔ asɛm no mu ara kwa.
There was no reason for it.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
You know, we can do it.	Wunim, yebetumi ayɛ.
The real thing.	Ade ankasa.
The rest is the same.	Nea aka no yɛ ade koro.
He was terrible to her.	Ná ɔyɛ hu ma no.
Under his hands.	Wɔ ne nsa ase.
There were windows.	Ná mfɛnsere wɔ hɔ.
I lived with him for quite some time.	Me ne no traa ase bere tenten bi.
He was glaring at her as fast as he could.	Ná ɔde n’ani kyerɛ no ntɛmntɛm sɛnea obetumi.
You don’t do that either.	Wo nso wonyɛ saa.
This had been there for a long time.	Ná eyi aba hɔ akyɛ.
That really bothered me.	Ɛno haw me ampa.
It’s a lot of fun.	Ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
Much to do out here.	Pii a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wɔ ha akyi.
You can’t imagine how beautiful they were.	Worentumi nsusuw sɛnea na wɔn ho yɛ fɛ no ho.
He had constant headaches.	Ná ne ti yɛ no yaw bere nyinaa.
It doesn’t hurt that much anymore.	Ɛnyɛ yaw saa bio.
Don’t do that.	Mma wonyɛ saa.
I had a job.	Na mewɔ adwuma.
But the money will be nice.	Nanso sika no bɛyɛ fɛ.
And you can’t do anything.	Na worentumi nyɛ hwee.
But put this aside for now.	Nanso fa eyi to nkyɛn mprempren.
Good and evil.	Papa ne bɔne.
Often many people were involved.	Mpɛn pii no na nnipa pii de wɔn ho hyɛ mu.
I want to tell you this.	Mepɛ sɛ meka eyi kyerɛ wo.
However, there is one more thing to remember.	Nanso, ade biako wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wokae bio.
It obviously didn’t work.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛnyɛ adwuma.
You knew that.	Ná wunim saa.
That might be an issue so you can sort it out.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ asɛm bi sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wubetumi ayɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
The test can start at any time.	Sɔhwɛ no betumi afi ase wɔ bere biara a wopɛ mu.
It’s easy, really.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw, ampa.
I had never been so happy.	Ná m’ani nnye saa da.
It’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
You can’t see it.	Worentumi nhu.
It was all from our own resources.	Ná ne nyinaa fi yɛn ankasa nneɛma mu.
They pointed a gun at me.	Wɔde tuo bi kyerɛɛ me.
I want to have a party.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ apontow bi.
A sense of hopelessness touched him.	Anidaso a onni ho adwene bi kaa ne ho.
These pictures are difficult.	Saa mfonini ahorow yi yɛ den.
Everyone was sitting on top of everyone else.	Ná obiara te obiara so.
A bed is a piece of furniture.	Mpa yɛ dan mu nneɛma bi.
Then comes another.	Ɛno akyi no, foforo nso ba.
But there seems to be more here than that.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea pii wɔ ha sen saa.
Not just today.	Ɛnyɛ nnɛ nkutoo.
Every aspect of human nature	Onipa su fã biara .
The news caused great excitement in the city.	Asɛm no maa anigye kɛse baa kurow no mu.
But no one seemed to care.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea obiara mfa ne ho.
Only on the highway.	Ɔkwan kɛse no so nkutoo.
Maybe he didn’t know it himself.	Ebia na ɔno ankasa nnim.
It was never one face.	Ná ɛnyɛ anim biako da.
I was out there when everything happened.	Na mewɔ abɔnten hɔ bere a biribiara kɔɔ so no.
The drought began two years ago.	Ɔpɛ no fii ase mfe abien a atwam ni.
There was so much to do.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Once again, this is not true.	Saa bere yi nso, eyi nyɛ nokware.
I am definitely a summer girl.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ meyɛ awɔw bere mu abeawa.
So he was here.	Enti na ɔwɔ ha.
Everyone feels it.	Obiara te nka.
He thought he knew that way now.	Ná osusuw sɛ onim saa kwan no mprempren.
That is no longer necessary.	Ɛno ho nhia bio.
That’s one of the beautiful things about it.	Ɛno ne nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ a ɛwɔ ho no mu biako.
Not the way you want them to be.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea wopɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no.
So much happened in a few days.	Enti nneɛma pii sii wɔ nna kakraa bi mu.
Put your clothes back on.	San hyɛ wo ntade.
I don’t have any money now.	Minni sika biara mprempren.
I should like to hang out with them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani gye ho sɛ me ne wɔn bɛbɔ.
This probably shouldn’t have been surprising.	Ebia na ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa.
But it’s also a soft power.	Nanso ɛyɛ tumi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw nso.
His film was the first.	Ne sini no na ɔno na na odi kan.
This made me think about things.	Eyi maa misusuw nneɛma ho.
This was also a mistake.	Ná eyi nso yɛ mfomso.
I just stare at him.	Mehwɛ no denneennen kɛkɛ.
He didn't want to hear it anymore.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔte bio.
Someone may still be inside.	Ebia obi da so ara wɔ mu.
Nothing is ever perfect.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ pɛ da.
Tom hired me.	Tom faa me adwuma.
Plenty of time to play it.	Bere pii a wɔde bɛbɔ no.
The best move you could have made.	Tu a eye sen biara a anka wubetumi ayɛ.
Tell me, dog.	Ka kyerɛ me, ɔkraman.
You weren’t the one.	Ɛnyɛ wo na na woyɛ saa.
Everyone in town loves him.	Obiara a ɔwɔ kurow no mu ani gye ne ho.
Today, though, had been fun.	Nanso, na nnɛ ayɛ anigye.
The scenery is amazing.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ nwonwa.
This is also great.	Eyi nso yɛ kɛse.
I couldn’t save him.	Na mintumi nnye no nkwa.
No one ever did that for you.	Obiara anyɛ saa amma wo da.
You are here now.	Wowɔ ha seesei.
Maybe not much, maybe longer.	Ebia ɛnyɛ pii, ebia bere tenten.
But that didn’t happen.	Nanso ɛno amma.
Not for now, at least.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren de, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
Believe me, it is.	Gye me di, ɛte saa.
And I’m not sure what to do.	Na m’adwene yɛɛ me so.
Create a party out of any season.	Yɛ apontow bi fi bere biara mu.
Let our hair grow long.	Ma yɛn ti nhwi nyɛ tenten.
He was very excited.	Ná n’ani agye yiye.
Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.	Fa ma ɛyɛ hyew, ɛyɛ hyew, anaasɛ fa ma wɔ dan mu hyew mu.
But don’t tell him that.	Nanso nka saa nkyerɛ no.
You never know how a book will turn out.	Wunnim sɛnea nhoma bi bɛyɛ da.
I hope that is the case.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
It seems to have worked so far.	Ɛte sɛ nea ayɛ adwuma de besi saa bere yi.
My argument is this.	Me nsɛm a meka ne sɛ eyi.
Tests are difficult.	Sɔhwɛ ahorow yɛ den.
He's about to do that.	Ɔreyɛ ayɛ saa.
He was underwater.	Ná ɔwɔ nsu ase.
I'm like a.	Me te sɛ a.
There were two such cases.	Na nsɛm abien bi wɔ hɔ a ɛte saa.
We have to make up our minds.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ yɛn adwene.
I should have given you everything.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mede biribiara ma wo.
Lots of new stuff, learning every day.	Nneɛma foforo pii, adesua da biara da.
We’re excited.	Yɛn ani agye.
Go indoors and play.	Kɔ dan mu na di agoru.
That’s why we exist in the first place.	Ɛno nti na yɛwɔ hɔ wɔ nea edi kan no mu no.
His reputation is impeccable.	Ne din pa no yɛ nea mfomso biara nni ho.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia biara.
Eventually, he did.	Awiei koraa no, ɔyɛɛ saa.
I thought he might be in it.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia na ɔwɔ mu.
I thought maybe you didn’t care.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia wo mfa wo ho.
But no one was willing to talk about it.	Nanso na obiara nni ɔpɛ sɛ ɔbɛka ho asɛm.
I do like your movies.	Meyɛ sɛ mo sini ahorow no.
He should be much better this year.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ papa kɛse afe yi.
He loved to make things.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ nneɛma.
Otherwise, many people would.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, anka nnipa pii bɛyɛ.
Ultimately, I’m not sure.	Awiei koraa no, m’ani nnye ho.
Most of them have already been brought to that.	Wɔde wɔn mu dodow no ara aba saa dedaw.
He was not very popular.	Ná nkurɔfo ani nnye ne ho kɛse.
Things are clear.	Nneɛma mu da hɔ.
However, the situation is still far from ideal.	Nanso, tebea no da so ara nyɛ nea eye sen biara koraa.
Everything is working fine.	Biribiara reyɛ adwuma yiye.
But problems remain.	Nanso ɔhaw ahorow da so ara wɔ hɔ.
But it’s not necessarily a bad thing.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ade bɔne ankasa.
None of them made the play.	Wɔn mu biara anyɛ agoru no.
But part of him also had to be faithful.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ ne fã bi nso di nokware.
They are the same thing.	Wɔn nso yɛ ade koro.
And this isn’t just about money.	Na eyi nyɛ sika nkutoo ho asɛm.
I thought it was a fantastic project.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It was completely familiar to me.	Ná ɛyɛ nea minim koraa.
This route will be popular.	Saa kwan yi bɛyɛ nea nnipa pii fa so.
No system is perfect.	Nhyehyɛe biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ pɛ.
He took it to the kids and they liked him.	Ɔde kɔɔ mmofra no nkyɛn na wɔn ani gyee ne ho.
He doesn’t do that.	Ɔnyɛ saa.
But this doesn’t have to be the case.	Nanso ɛho nhia sɛ eyi ba saa.
However, there was something strange about it.	Nanso, na biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ho.
I know it’s very good.	Minim sɛ eye paa.
We can’t take it too far.	Yɛrentumi mfa nkɔ akyiri koraa.
Everyone says they are innocent.	Nnipa nyinaa ka sɛ wɔn ho nni asɛm.
However, it is also human nature.	Nanso, ɛyɛ onipa su nso.
Someone else not to trust! 	Obi foforo a ɛnsɛ sɛ wode wo ho to no so!
. . . .	.
It was as big as me.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse te sɛ me ara.
It has been a pleasure working with you.	Ayɛ anigye sɛ me ne mo reyɛ adwuma.
Not a little bit like that.	Ɛnyɛ saa kakra.
He and his team found something remarkable.	Ɔne ne kuw no huu biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Just take it.	Fa no kɛkɛ.
In a way that was good.	Wɔ ɔkwan a na eye so.
So, tell me about it.	Enti, ka kyerɛ me.
The dog kicked his leg.	Ɔkraman no bɔɔ ne nan ho.
This was a huge mistake.	Ná eyi yɛ mfomso kɛse.
He is not a human being.	Ɔnyɛ onipa.
He had done so.	Ná wayɛ saa.
There was always plenty of water.	Ná nsu pii wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
I’m not going to be surprised.	M’ani nnye ho sɛ ɛbɛyɛ me nwonwa.
Current projects include film posters.	Nnwuma a ɔreyɛ mprempren no bi ne sini ho mfonini ahorow.
I have an idea.	Mewɔ adwene bi.
What we need to do more of.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ no kɛse.
He actually did that.	Ɔyɛɛ saa ankasa.
The home group.	Ofie kuw no.
Think about it.	Susuw ho hwɛ.
I understand these comments.	Mete saa nsɛm yi ase.
It’s been too hot here for too long.	Ɛyɛ hyew dodo wɔ ha bere tenten dodo.
Help along the way.	Mmoa wɔ kwan so.
Add a little more water if necessary.	Sɛ ɛho hia a, fa nsu kakra ka ho.
That all works well.	Ɛno nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye.
There is no right to this matter.	Hokwan biara nni asɛm yi ho.
That guy spent hours filming.	Saa ɔbarima no de nnɔnhwerew pii yɛɛ sini.
And if he did .	Na sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa a .
First in prison.	Nea edi kan wɔ afiase.
No past friends.	Nnamfo a atwam biara nni hɔ.
So much power over anyone, or anything.	Enti tumi kɛse wɔ obiara so, anaa biribiara so.
There were more empty beds than not.	Ná mpa a hwee nni so pii wɔ hɔ sen sɛ ɛnte saa.
Here is my situation.	Me tebea ni.
The book failed miserably.	Nhoma no antumi ankɔ yiye koraa.
It wasn't supposed to look like this.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ te sɛ eyi.
Probably better than anyone else.	Ebia eye sen obiara.
There was a large cell.	Ná afiase dan kɛse bi wɔ hɔ.
He knew about her.	Ná onim ne ho asɛm.
He is like that.	Ɔte saa.
This is the last thing you want.	Eyi ne ade a etwa to a wopɛ.
It didn’t matter to me.	Ná ɛnyɛ me asɛm.
You can’t tell anyone.	Worentumi nka nkyerɛ obiara.
We’re in love with him.	Yɛn ani gye ne ho.
There will be water in the city unless some measures are taken.	Nsu bɛba kurow no mu gye sɛ wɔyɛ nneɛma bi.
I don’t want to bring that to school.	Mempɛ sɛ mede saa bɛba sukuu.
There was only one way.	Na ɔkwan biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I am here on business.	Mewɔ ha wɔ adwuma ho.
No life out of it, no joy.	Nkwa biara mfi mu, anigye biara nni hɔ.
And that’s about all there is.	Na ɛno fa nea ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa ho.
That can’t be a bad thing.	Ɛno ntumi nyɛ ade bɔne.
Where is the	Kae na .
Truth be told.	Nokware nka.
The best stories need more time.	Nsɛm a eye sen biara no hia bere pii.
They’re all after the money, and after that, the people.	Wɔn nyinaa di sika no akyi, na ɛno akyi no, nkurɔfo no.
There are two reasons for this.	Nneɛma abien bi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
That doesn’t help.	Ɛno mmoa.
I'll take you down.	Mede wo bɛkɔ fam.
There is no doubt about this.	Akyinnye biara nni ho wɔ eyi ho.
And it’s the same thing.	Na ɛte saa ara.
My car was gone.	Ná me kar no nni hɔ bio.
The detail of the images is amazing.	Mfonini ahorow no mu nsɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa no yɛ nwonwa.
But there are two reasons not to do so here.	Nanso nneɛma abien nti na ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa wɔ ha.
Yours looks even better.	Wo de no hwɛ yiye mpo.
There are two reasons for this.	Nneɛma abien nti na wɔyɛ eyi.
This is a very interesting story.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
It would be wrong to do so.	Ɛbɛyɛ bɔne sɛ wobɛyɛ.
There are two important aspects to this story.	Nneɛma abien a ɛho hia wɔ saa asɛm yi mu.
Don’t go where they tell you.	Mma nkɔ baabi a wɔka kyerɛ wo no.
I have to tell him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no.
People really started liking him.	Nkurɔfo fii ase ani gyee ne ho ankasa.
I think that’s the most important thing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne ade a ɛho hia sen biara.
So many things to do in a day.	Enti nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wɔ da koro mu.
And at the time, it was a pretty good idea.	Na saa bere no, na ɛyɛ adwene pa koraa.
Here is a picture of one.	Biako mfonini ni.
Years ago, that wasn’t true.	Mfe pii a atwam ni no, na ɛno nyɛ nokware.
The food went very well.	Aduan no kɔɔ yiye paa.
He had been for some time too.	Ná ɔno nso ayɛ bere bi.
I knew my wife.	Ná minim me yere.
His clothes were beautiful.	Ná ne ntade yɛ fɛ.
The story is a lie.	Asɛm no yɛ atoro.
But now he felt free.	Nanso seesei de, na ɔte nka sɛ ɔde ne ho.
The other two nodded.	Nnipa baanu foforo no de wɔn ti too fam.
That starts tomorrow.	Ɛno fi ase ɔkyena.
We all owe you.	Yɛn nyinaa de wo ka.
He set it up.	Ɔde sii hɔ.
No one found anything wrong with it.	Obiara anhu mfomso biara wɔ ho.
He deals with people every day.	Ɔne nkurɔfo di nsɛm da biara da.
He’s like you.	Ɔte sɛ wo.
No money is needed.	Sika biara nhia.
He is very successful.	Ɔyɛ obi a odi yiye paa.
He seemed happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
There is some truth to the story	Nokware bi wɔ asɛm no mu
Which chapter would you like? 	Ti bɛn na w’ani begye ho?
Each of those is important.	Ɛno mu biara ho hia.
The method is quite simple and you. 	Ɔkwan no yɛ mmerɛw koraa na wo. 
i like it for the most part.	m'ani gye ho wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu.
This amount of time is not necessary.	Saa bere dodow yi ho nhia.
And on to the next point, and it works fine.	Na kɔ asɛm a edi hɔ no so, na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
In any case, the news has come early.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, asɛm no aba ntɛm.
But it was a completely different man.	Nanso na ɛyɛ ɔbarima foforo koraa.
That’s how good he is.	Saa na ɔyɛ papa.
You’ll be with me.	Wo ne me bɛka ho.
Food was excellent.	Ná aduan yɛ papa yiye.
Can you feed the animals for me?	So wubetumi ama mmoa no aduan ama me?
Jobs seem unnecessary.	Nnwuma te sɛ nea ɛho nhia.
And someone else.	Na obi foforo nso.
He has nothing to do with them.	Ɔne wɔn nni hwee yɛ.
My dad was impressed.	Me papa ani gyee ho.
I know and you know too.	Minim na wo nso wunim.
Make sure it is warm.	Hwɛ hu sɛ ɛyɛ hyew.
Take off the man's clothes.	Yi ɔbarima no ntade.
Maybe power too.	Ebia tumi nso.
Things are going well.	Nneɛma rekɔ yiye.
Hope you like them!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani gye wɔn ho!.
And he was amazing.	Na ɔyɛ nwonwa.
What he was doing.	Nea na ɔyɛ.
Feel even more intense.	Te nka kɛse mpo.
I put my hand on the table.	Mede me nsa too pon no so.
I expected to be honest.	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ mɛka nokware.
It’s too bad for them.	Ɛyɛ bɔne dodo ma wɔn.
I think it’s perfect.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ pɛ.
As soon as we can go.	Sɛnea yebetumi akɔ ntɛm ara.
And my opinion.	Ne m’adwene.
But you have to practice what you say.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wode nea woka no di dwuma.
This room has a large door inside.	Saa dan yi wɔ ɔpon kɛse bi wɔ mu.
We were all shocked.	Yɛn nyinaa ho dwiriw yɛn.
The amount of stuff he had was amazing.	Ná nneɛma dodow a na ɔwɔ no yɛ nwonwa.
You should not be surprised to find that food is scarce.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo nwonwa sɛ wuhu sɛ aduan ho yɛ na.
I think that was human nature.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno yɛ onipa su.
Right now, anyway.	Seesei ara, sɛnea ɛte biara.
That was the first one.	Ná ɛno ne nea edi kan.
Perspectives need to be practiced and you see how they are done.	Adwene a wɔde hwɛ nneɛma ho hia sɛ wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu na wuhu sɛnea wɔyɛ.
Surely there had to be something.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ.
Or we were the only ones.	Anaasɛ na yɛn nkutoo na yɛwɔ.
It is a human nature.	Ɛyɛ onipa su.
The first of these forces is the status quo.	Tumi ahorow yi mu nea edi kan ne tebea a ɛwɔ hɔ no.
Those words do not mention it.	Saa nsɛm no nka ho asɛm.
Is he the one.	So ɔno.
We would both do that.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa bɛyɛ saa.
To say otherwise would be a lie.	Sɛ́ wobɛka sɛ ɛnte saa no bɛyɛ atoro.
Not even you.	Ɛnyɛ wo mpo.
It looks beautiful.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
They participated in the learning process.	Wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ adesua nhyehyɛe no mu.
Not to mention how big of a dog he was.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea na ɔyɛ ɔkraman kɛse no ho asɛm.
It is quite easy to use now.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa sɛ wode bedi dwuma mprempren.
Maybe in a year or two.	Ebia wɔ afe biako anaa abien mu.
He knew he had to bring something new to the table.	Ná onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde biribi foforo ba pon no so.
No one knows this about you at all, not even your closest friends.	Obiara nnim wo ho eyi koraa, na wo nnamfo paa mpo nnim.
The condition is more common in children.	Tebea no taa ba mmofra so kɛse.
I'm sure someone can find them.	Migye di sɛ obi betumi ahu wɔn.
I can’t feel that way anymore, man.	Mintumi nte nka saa bio, ɔbarima.
Those who say this are wrong.	Wɔn a wɔka eyi no di mfomso.
I think he really hurt her.	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛɛ no ​​yaw ampa.
That can’t be imagined.	Ɛno ntumi nsusuw ho.
You have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
Every picture is a sex scene.	Mfonini biara yɛ nna ho mfonini.
I was the only one in the house.	Ná me nkutoo na mewɔ fie hɔ.
He will do it.	Ɔbɛyɛ.
Not very exciting.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
Great food, but expensive.	Aduan kɛse, nanso ne bo yɛ den.
You can’t control him, and that makes him dangerous.	Worentumi nni ne so, na ɛno ma ne ho yɛ hu.
Once this was life.	Bere bi na eyi yɛ nkwa.
The two remained close for a number of years.	Wɔn baanu kɔɔ so bɛn wɔn ho mfe dodow bi.
He is everything you weren’t.	Ɔyɛ biribiara a na wonyɛ.
However, it is not the first time.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea edi kan.
He was in way over his head.	Ná ɔwɔ kwan so wɔ ne ti so.
I hoped it was.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
I'm doing it right.	Meyɛ no yiye.
What he wasn’t in.	Nea na onni mu.
But they were doing it.	Nanso na wɔyɛ saa.
For us, it was easy money.	Wɔ yɛn fam no, na ɛyɛ sika a ɛnyɛ den.
And run three hours a day.	Na tu mmirika nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa da biara.
I know it’s him.	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno.
He has no sense of happiness.	Onni anigye ho adwene biara.
None of the kids had a phone.	Ná mmofra no mu biara nni telefon.
This is not a matter of opinion.	Eyi nyɛ adwene ho asɛm.
Maybe it’s necessary.	Ebia ɛho hia.
Just a little can go a long way.	Kakraa bi kɛkɛ betumi aboa kɛse.
I think there is a floor for the price.	Misusuw sɛ ɛwɔ fam bi wɔ bo no ho.
There is no one in it.	Obiara nni mu.
It should be the same here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa ara wɔ ha.
I have gone down quite a few times.	Mede me ho akɔ fam mpɛn kakraa bi pɛ.
Or with me.	Anaasɛ me nkyɛn.
I can't believe that now.	Mintumi nnye saa asɛm no nni mprempren.
Stay there with them.	Tra hɔ wɔ wɔn nkyɛn.
We were shocked.	Yɛn ho dwiriw yɛn.
But again, we have licensing issues.	Nanso bio, yɛwɔ tumi krataa ho nsɛm.
Put it outside under a full moon.	Fa to abɔnten wɔ ɔsram a ayɛ ma ase.
Your saying that doesn’t make it so.	Wo ka a woka saa no mma ɛnyɛ saa.
This material is used to make waterproof clothing.	Wɔde saa ade yi yɛ ntade a nsu ntumi nkɔ mu.
This did not happen when it was new.	Eyi anyɛ bere a na ɛyɛ foforo no.
I have done this before.	Mayɛ eyi pɛn.
Add the ingredients.	Fa nneɛma a wode bɛyɛ aduan no hyɛ mu.
Nor was it then.	Saa ara na ɛnyɛ saa saa bere no.
However, there is.	Nanso, ɛwɔ hɔ.
Remember, it’s true.	Kae sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
He can do the same for you today.	Obetumi ayɛ saa ara ama wo nnɛ.
And it was very beautiful.	Na ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
It was cheap.	Ná ne bo yɛ mmerɛw.
Just indicate if you’re interested.	Kyerɛ kɛkɛ sɛ w’ani gye ho sɛ w’ani gye ho a.
Their power appears as temporary.	Wɔn tumi no da adi sɛ bere tiaa bi.
This is usually because the dog is afraid.	Mpɛn pii no, nea enti a ɛte saa ne sɛ ɔkraman no suro.
People were impressed.	Nkurɔfo ani gyee ho.
He forgets where he is for a moment.	Ne werɛ fi baabi a ɔwɔ no kakra.
Time and a half.	Bere ne fã.
We cannot thank you enough.	Yɛrentumi nna mo ase sɛnea ɛsɛ.
This was going on.	Ná eyi rekɔ so.
This went on for hours.	Eyi kɔɔ so nnɔnhwerew pii.
She is his wife.	Ɔyɛ ne yere.
It’s a wonderful story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
That was my only hope.	Ná ɛno nkutoo ne anidaso a mewɔ.
And he’s interested in it.	Na n’ani gye ho.
I knew him well enough.	Ná minim no yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He was very large.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse paa.
At least in my opinion.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ m’adwene mu.
And that will be it.	Na ɛno bɛyɛ saa.
The first method is very simple.	Ɔkwan a edi kan no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
However, their children have nothing.	Nanso, wɔn mma nni hwee.
And not too often.	Na ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii dodo.
They are themselves.	Wɔyɛ wɔn ho.
And maybe it doesn’t matter.	Na ebia ɛnyɛ hwee.
He had never done this before.	Ná ɔnyɛ eyi da.
It was a great thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade kɛse.
I played with a few of them and they looked pretty good.	Me ne wɔn mu kakraa bi dii agoru na na ɛte sɛ nea eye yiye.
We can no longer treat people this way.	Yɛrentumi ne nkurɔfo bedi wɔ saa kwan yi so bio.
I don’t do that right now.	Menyɛ saa mprempren.
I believe his music has helped many people.	Migye di sɛ ne nnwom aboa nnipa pii.
It’s not that bad.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne saa.
He’ll be interested.	N’ani begye ho.
How to touch it.	Sɛnea wɔde wɔn nsa ka.
And he had to do that well.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa yiye.
He looked at her with interest.	Ɔde anigye hwɛɛ no.
It just looks beautiful when you do it like that.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa bere a woyɛ no saa no.
The game was never really interesting.	Ná agoru no ani nnye ho ankasa da.
And he was a good one.	Na ɔyɛ papa.
In this experiment,.	Wɔ saa sɔhwɛ yi mu no,.
I’m glad he finally did something at home.	M’ani agye sɛ awiei koraa no ɔyɛɛ biribi wɔ fie.
It gets much easier after that.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse wɔ ɛno akyi.
This includes all rent and any other rent.	Eyi ka dan ka nyinaa ne dan ka biara a aka ho.
If you do this.	Sɛ woyɛ eyi.
Both seemed well put to use.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔde abien no nyinaa adi dwuma yiye.
You know, usually.	Wunim, mpɛn pii no.
It was the best we could do.	Ná ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara a yebetumi ayɛ.
But! 	Nanso!
Definitely bad people.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nnipa bɔne.
I need to check if the path is clear.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ sɛ ɔkwan no mu da hɔ anaa.
But you are also human.	Nanso wo nso woyɛ onipa.
His words speak for him well.	Ne nsɛm no kasa ma no yiye.
His pictures are amazing.	Ne mfonini ahorow no yɛ nwonwa.
This sounds like the movies to me.	Eyi te sɛ sini ahorow no ma me.
They are only children.	Wɔyɛ mmofra nkutoo.
This is just water in here.	Eyi yɛ nsu a ɛwɔ ha mu ara kwa.
Your mother still has the receipt.	Wo maame da so ara wɔ krataa a wɔde gye sika no.
But it’s going on.	Nanso ɛrekɔ so.
He says money.	Ɔka sɛ sika.
However, you don’t.	Nanso, wonyɛ saa.
This is just a job.	Eyi yɛ adwuma ara kwa.
But it doesn’t.	Nanso nka.
The phone rang in the bedroom.	Telefon no bɔɔ wɔ mpa no mu.
Something had to give.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ biribi ma.
It’s just hard for me to say.	Ɛyɛ den ma me ara kwa sɛ mɛka.
You go with him.	Wo ne no kɔ.
You are strong enough to handle this.	Wo ho yɛ den na wubetumi adi eyi ho dwuma.
I expected him to join at any moment.	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɔbɛka ho bere biara.
I knew that was a long shot.	Ná minim sɛ ɛno yɛ tuo tenten.
Their own money.	Wɔn ankasa sika.
Food was what he needed first.	Aduan ne nea na odi kan hia.
Someone other than his mother.	Obi a ɛnyɛ ne maame.
He wanted to be that boy.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa abarimaa no.
That’s the first thing.	Ɛno ne ade a edi kan.
Either way, you have to hand it to them.	Ɔkwan biara so no, ɛsɛ sɛ wode hyɛ wɔn nsa.
He spent his whole life here!	Ɔde ne nkwa nna nyinaa traa ha!
Nothing is ever really random or planned.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wɔyɛ no kwa anaasɛ wɔyɛ ho nhyehyɛe ankasa da.
They have to work at night.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma anadwo.
Every year, though, new things are done.	Nanso, afe biara, wɔyɛ nneɛma foforo.
It’s the same as it is with you.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte wɔ wo ho no ara pɛ.
Very few people seemed interested in sex.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea nnipa kakraa bi pɛ na wɔn ani gye nna ho.
I wasn't used to this at all, until now.	Ná eyi nyɛɛ me su koraa, de besi nnɛ.
This is just our first tasks tonight.	Eyi yɛ yɛn nnwuma a edi kan ara kwa anadwo yi.
He had no idea how long he would be working.	Ná onni bere tenten a ɔde bɛyɛ adwuma no ho adwene biara.
You can do whatever you want with it.	Wubetumi de ayɛ nea wopɛ.
However, everyone makes mistakes.	Nanso, obiara di mfomso.
There are many different types of music.	Nnwom ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
Or any school days.	Anaasɛ sukuu nna biara.
I don’t think they do.	Minsusuw sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
It was a child.	Ná ɛyɛ abofra.
For a long time, no one said a word.	Bere tenten bi no, obiara anka asɛm biako mpo.
I knew the truth would eventually come out.	Ná minim sɛ awiei koraa no nokware no bɛba.
But there is another story at play.	Nanso asɛm foforo bi wɔ hɔ a ɛrekɔ so.
I was really excited to do that.	Ná m’ani agye ankasa sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
At that point we were happy.	Saa bere no na yɛn ani agye.
That’s the whole point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no nyinaa.
Use your feedback.	Fa wo nsɛm a wode ma no di dwuma.
It’s quick and cheap.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm na ne bo nyɛ den.
I can’t see you.	Mintumi nhu wo.
He’s a bad boy.	Ɔyɛ abarimaa bɔne.
I think we can take it from here.	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi agye afi ha.
I saw you in his arms.	Mihuu wo wɔ ne nsa so.
Just know that it is.	Hu ara sɛ ɛte saa.
I can’t get any.	Mintumi nnya bi.
The system is no longer valid.	Nhyehyɛe no nni dwuma bio.
Good meeting.	Nhyiam pa.
They obviously do.	Ɛda adi sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
The same is true of music.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nnwom ho.
It all went well.	Ne nyinaa dii yiye.
No one, ever.	Obiara nni hɔ, da.
But this is not necessary.	Nanso eyi ho nhia.
And that’s exactly what’s happening now.	Na ɛno ara ne nea ɛrekɔ so mprempren.
But it was too little too late.	Nanso na ɛyɛ kakraa bi dodo sɛ aka akyi dodo.
I loved the old game.	M’ani gyee agoru dedaw no ho.
His father had an idea of ​​what he should do.	Ná ne papa wɔ adwene bi wɔ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ho.
I found the food and gave it to him.	Mihuu aduan no na mede bi maa no.
It was going to be a very cold night.	Ná ɛbɛyɛ anadwo a awɔw wom kɛse.
The best of the best.	Nea eye paa.
Everyone does it now.	Obiara yɛ no mprempren.
If you like those things, fine.	Sɛ w’ani gye saa nneɛma no ho a, eye.
That same afternoon.	Saa awia no ara.
I'm so happy for you.	M'ani agye paa ma wo.
There were not many people outside.	Ná nnipa pii nni abɔnten.
In other words, it’s hard.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛyɛ den.
It’s somewhere else.	Ɛyɛ baabi foforo.
This ends the game immediately.	Eyi de agoru no ba awiei ntɛm ara.
You can get one quite cheaply today.	Wubetumi anya bi a ɛnyɛ den koraa nnɛ.
Look closely at the picture.	Hwɛ mfonini no yiye.
Those two things may behave independently.	Ebia saa nneɛma abien no bɛyɛ wɔn ade wɔ wɔn ankasa mu.
Go to the next door.	Kɔ ɔpon a edi hɔ no so.
It’s not your time.	Ɛnyɛ wo bere.
He wasn’t busy.	Ná onni adagyew.
There is another problem in this case.	Ɔhaw foforo nso wɔ asɛm yi mu.
That all works, for free.	Ɛno nyinaa yɛ adwuma, kwa.
This is obviously not the case.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nte saa.
He was only marginally interested.	Ná n’ani gye ho kakraa bi pɛ.
The time to do it should be urgent.	Ɛsɛ sɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no ntɛm.
He just creates everything.	Ɔbɔ biribiara kɛkɛ.
I have no idea why this isn't working.	Minnim nea enti a eyi nyɛ adwuma no ho adwene biara.
He hadn't been able to either, but he wanted to.	Ná ɔno nso antumi, nanso na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
It’s good for us.	Eye ma yɛn.
They don't seem to care about you two at all.	Ɛte sɛ nea mo baanu no ho nhia wɔn koraa.
I like to get along with people.	M’ani gye ho sɛ me ne nkurɔfo bɛbɔ yiye.
This is old-fashioned.	Eyi yɛ dedaw.
There is obviously money in it.	Ɛda adi sɛ sika wom.
The timing was impeccable.	Ná bere a wɔde yɛɛ adwuma no yɛ nea mfomso biara nni ho.
He knew that.	Ná onim saa asɛm no.
Issues you are working on or have an opinion on.	Nsɛm a woreyɛ ho adwuma anaasɛ wowɔ adwene bi wɔ ho.
So this is the idea.	Enti eyi ne adwene no.
So the story goes on.	Enti asɛm no kɔ so.
But only on paper.	Nanso wɔ krataa so nkutoo.
His mother lived with him.	Ná ne maame ne no te.
But it still has nothing to do with me.	Nanso ɛda so ara ne me nni hwee yɛ.
That goes for everyone.	Ɛno kɔ ma obiara.
I thought he did a really good job there.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔyɛɛ adwuma pa ankasa wɔ hɔ.
Anyway, definitely not any of the three.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ abiɛsa no mu biara.
It’s not perfect.	Ɛnyɛ pɛ.
I miss you so much.	Me werɛ afi wo saa.
I’m definitely enjoying it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ m’ani agye ho.
So this is what you would do.	Enti eyi ne nea anka wobɛyɛ.
The music was loud.	Ná nnwom no ano yɛ den.
It was actually a little weird.	Na ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra ankasa.
Take it one day at a time.	Fa no da koro biara.
It wasn’t just the animals.	Ná ɛnyɛ mmoa no ara kwa.
It’s a new city, not an old one.	Ɛyɛ kurow foforo, ɛnyɛ kurow dedaw.
Maybe he’s one of them.	Ebia ɔyɛ wɔn mu biako.
Many people are surprised by it.	Nnipa pii ho dwiriw wɔn wɔ ho.
He had to deal with problems at home.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ odi ɔhaw ahorow a ɛwɔ fie ho dwuma.
You can’t win.	Worentumi nni nkonim.
It needs to be hard and strong, and it is even.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den na ɛyɛ den, na ɛyɛ mpo.
Never let me do that again.	Mma menyɛ saa bio da.
He knew they were incredibly intelligent.	Ná onim sɛ wɔyɛ nyansa a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Later that day.	Akyiri yi saa da no.
Not even a little bit.	Ɛnyɛ kakra mpo.
I love a new dress!	M’ani gye atade foforo ho!
It seems to be new.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ foforo.
I can just see it.	Metumi ahu ara kwa.
He was the only one who did.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔyɛɛ saa.
His best chance was on the ground.	Ná hokwan a eye sen biara a ɔwɔ no wɔ fam.
I’m very excited about it.	M’ani gyee ho yiye.
Two days.	Nna abien.
He is on you.	Ɔwɔ wo so.
I have to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
No one did that.	Obiara anyɛ saa.
So much happiness.	Anigye pii saa.
He focused on it intensely.	Ɔde n’adwene sii so denneennen.
He is not one of us.	Ɔnyɛ yɛn mu biako.
If you have kids, make a game out of it.	Sɛ wowɔ mmofra a, fa yɛ agoru bi.
I didn't have a great game.	Ná minni agoru kɛse bi.
There was no power in it.	Ná tumi biara nni mu.
There is no doubt that	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, .
And it was very painful.	Na ɛyɛ yaw pii.
A group of people took good care of them.	Nnipa kuw bi hwɛɛ wɔn yiye.
Get out of the way.	Fi kwan no so.
Probably the whole population.	Ebia nnipa dodow no nyinaa.
They were one and the same person.	Ná wɔyɛ onipa biako ne onipa koro.
His presence grew stronger.	Ne ba a ɛwɔ hɔ no mu yɛɛ den kɛse.
What a joy that would be.	Hwɛ anigye bɛn ara na ɛno bɛyɛ.
The time will come.	Bere no bɛba.
She was a working girl too.	Ná ɔno nso yɛ abeawa a ɔyɛ adwuma.
This is not such a case.	Eyi nyɛ asɛm a ɛte saa.
The movie was great.	Ná sini no yɛ kɛse.
At the bottom again.	Wɔ ase hɔ bio.
It’s not about how many things you have.	Ɛnyɛ nneɛma dodow a wowɔ ho asɛm.
It’s not any good.	Ɛnyɛ papa biara.
Or at least that’s what it looks like.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne sɛnea ɛte.
We like it too easily.	Yɛn ani gye ho ntɛmntɛm dodo.
All three systems were efficient and functional.	Ná nhyehyɛe abiɛsa no nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye na na ɛyɛ adwuma.
He absolutely loved it.	Ná n’ani gye ho koraa.
He just didn't know how many.	Ná onnim dodow ahe ara kwa.
Apparently there was no problem.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
I have to thank you for everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda mo ase wɔ biribiara ho.
I’d love to do a lot of fun things.	M’ani begye ho sɛ mɛyɛ nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ anigye.
This is the way we should be.	Eyi ne ɔkwan a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
Work on anything really simple.	Yɛ biribiara a ɛnyɛ den ankasa ho adwuma.
But there was more to the story.	Nanso na pii wɔ asɛm no mu.
Move the bottom half of the picture.	Fa mfonini no fã a ɛwɔ ase no kɔ.
I doubt it, but maybe.	Migye ho kyim, nanso ebia.
This is your last chance.	Eyi ne hokwan a etwa to a wowɔ.
Fortunately, it was painful.	Nea eye ne sɛ, na ɛyɛ yaw.
What it is like today.	Nea ɛte nnɛ.
But if you can, make it work for you.	Nanso sɛ wubetumi a, ma ɛnyɛ adwuma ma wo.
He did it for his mother.	Ɔyɛɛ maa ne maame.
This is part of a bigger project.	Eyi yɛ adwuma kɛse bi fã.
Everything seems to be going well.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara rekɔ so yiye.
And he did have some help.	Na na ɔwɔ mmoa bi ampa.
I am glad you are here with me.	Ɛyɛ me anigye sɛ wo ne me wɔ ha.
We have each other’s backs.	Yɛwɔ yɛn ho yɛn ho akyi.
But that didn’t happen.	Nanso ɛno amma mu.
It’s not good that he’s taking such a big risk.	Ɛnyɛ papa sɛ ɔde ne ho to asiane mu kɛse saa.
You can go with whatever you want.	Wubetumi de biribiara a wopɛ akɔ.
I just can't get enough.	Mintumi nnya nea ɛdɔɔso ara kwa.
We have to do something about it ourselves.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn ankasa yɛ ho biribi.
However, I was completely determined.	Nanso, na m’adwene asi gyinae koraa.
The pictures are fake, pictures, and pictures.	Mfonini ahorow no yɛ atoro, mfonini ahorow, ne mfonini ahorow.
And so he can.	Na saa na obetumi.
What a man he is.	Ɔbarima bɛn ara ni.
That would be my father.	Ɛno bɛyɛ me papa.
I know how I need to know.	Minim sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
You don’t have to be a genius.	Ɛho nhia sɛ woyɛ obi a onim nyansa.
But he knew it wasn’t.	Nanso na onim sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
However, the chart reveals a bit more.	Nanso, nhyehyɛe no da pii adi kakra.
The meeting lasted two hours.	Nhyiam no dii nnɔnhwerew abien.
Maybe even a month.	Ebia ɔsram biako mpo.
It will definitely do me good.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛbɛyɛ me yiye.
What must have happened was that the person shot him.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ esii ne sɛ, onipa no tuo no tuo.
Take what you can control.	Fa nea wubetumi adi so.
Think about today.	Susuw nnɛ ho hwɛ.
He obviously doesn’t.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
Thank you so much for the wonderful lunch my friends.	Meda wo ase pii wɔ awia aduan a ɛyɛ anigye no ho me nnamfo.
That doesn’t matter to me.	Ɛno nyɛ hwee wɔ me fam.
And they all had the same problem.	Na wɔn nyinaa nyaa ɔhaw koro no ara.
What a good boy he is.	Abarimaa pa bɛn ara ni.
This failed to happen.	Eyi antumi anyɛ.
You just have to be mentally tough.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ den wɔ adwene mu ara kwa.
They are very friendly.	Wɔyɛ nnamfo paa.
He may do more, or he may do it differently.	Ebia ɔbɛyɛ pii, anaasɛ ebia ɔbɛyɛ no ɔkwan foforo so.
I had some of it.	Ná mewɔ bi.
I have good days and bad days.	Mewɔ nna pa ne nna bɔne.
He would use that.	Ná ɔde saa asɛm no bedi dwuma.
I love the child.	M’ani gye abofra no ho.
Results are from three independent experiments.	Nea afi mu aba no fi sɔhwɛ ahorow abiɛsa a wɔde wɔn ho mu.
Everyone said that.	Obiara kaa saa.
However, make no mistake.	Nanso, nni mfomso biara.
It has a few people.	Ɛwɔ nnipa kakraa bi.
Someone has to be at the door.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi wɔ ɔpon no ano.
As it was, there weren’t many mistakes.	Sɛnea na ɛte no, na mfomso pii nni hɔ.
You are life to me.	Woyɛ nkwa ma me.
No doubt he was concerned about her.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ne ho asɛm haw no.
Keep doing that.	Kɔ so yɛ saa.
I had so much to tell him.	Ná mewɔ nsɛm pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no.
He didn't want to do that.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Anyone can show here.	Obiara betumi akyerɛ wɔ ha.
Always prioritize schoolwork before anything else.	Fa sukuu adwuma di kan bere nyinaa ansa na biribi foforo biara aba.
Not now or never.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren anaasɛ ɛnte saa da.
In the morning it wasn’t the same.	Anɔpa no na ɛnte saa ara.
Just like always.	Sɛnea ɛte bere biara no ara pɛ.
There are two good reasons why.	Nneɛma pa abien na enti ɛte saa.
It has already done something like that.	Ayɛ biribi a ɛte saa dedaw.
Tomorrow you will get the boy.	Ɔkyena wo nsa bɛka abarimaa no.
And with the incident.	Ne ne asɛm a esii.
I could watch it over and over again.	Ná metumi ahwɛ no mpɛn pii.
As a dog, he was very beautiful.	Sɛ́ ɔkraman no, na ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
His head was down.	Ná ne ti abɔ fam.
He didn't want to tell her the truth.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔbɛka nokware akyerɛ no.
This bike is too fast for me.	Saa sakre yi yɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo ma me.
And he didn’t like it.	Na n’ani nnye ho.
Forget me not, and remember me in mine.	Wo werɛ mfi me, na kae me wɔ me de mu.
One moment of thought leads to the next.	Adwene bere biako de kɔ nea edi hɔ no mu.
The other two did not.	Nnipa baanu a aka no anyɛ saa.
At least you walk with me until then.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wo ne me nantew kosi saa bere no.
He wanted to be both.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa.
Other days were easy.	Nna foforo nso na ɛnyɛ den.
The system worked well.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛɛ adwuma yiye.
It’s really good.	Ɛyɛ papa ankasa.
But don’t touch them.	Nanso mfa wo nsa nka wɔn.
It was a disaster.	Ná ɛyɛ asiane.
Most importantly, include it.	Nea ɛho hia sen biara no, fa ka ho.
She was not his mother.	Ná ɔnyɛ ne maame.
Maybe for hours.	Ebia nnɔnhwerew bi.
Everyone likes surprises.	Obiara ani gye nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa ho.
That sounds fantastic.	Ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Or the same thing.	Anaasɛ saa ara.
His name was close.	Ná ne din de bɛn.
Winter house without windows.	Awɔw bere mu ofie a mfɛnsere nni mu.
It was a beautiful day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
That’s what you’ll do.	Ɛno na wobɛyɛ.
He can make any movie interesting.	Obetumi ama sini biara ayɛ anigye.
On the one hand, he seemed very nice and affable.	Ɔkwan biako so no, na ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye na ɔpɛ nnipa.
Or even part time.	Anaasɛ bere fã mpo.
In a few hours, he would be fine.	Nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi mu no, na ne ho bɛtɔ no.
It was just never too exciting for me.	Na ɛnyɛ anigye dodo mma me da kɛkɛ.
That picture has to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ saa mfonini no kɔ.
Not at all.	Ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
If anyone could lead the party in such a situation.	Sɛ obi betumi adi apontow no anim wɔ tebea a ɛte saa mu a.
It is an important investment.	Ɛyɛ sika a wɔde hyɛ mu a ɛho hia.
Nor is it good.	Saa ara nso na ɛnyɛ papa.
I was hard on it.	Ná meyɛ den wɔ ho.
That’s easy.	Ɛno yɛ mmerɛw.
So.	Nti.
It’s beautiful this way.	Ɛyɛ fɛ saa kwan yi so.
However, one thing is still missing.	Nanso, ade biako da so ara nni hɔ.
It’s ours to own.	Ɛyɛ yɛn de.
My favorite book is this one.	Nhoma a m’ani gye ho paa ne eyi.
Really happy for him.	Anigye ankasa ma no.
I think the idea works.	Misusuw sɛ adwene no yɛ adwuma.
We need to do better than that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nea eye sen saa.
Maybe you should do that.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
He knows a lot about the movies.	Onim sini ahorow no ho nsɛm pii.
I worked for him.	Meyɛɛ adwuma maa no.
I loved going there.	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ mɛkɔ hɔ.
Good and evil run into each other if you will.	Sɛ wopɛ a, papa ne bɔne tu mmirika kɔ wɔn ho wɔn ho mu.
So it’s you.	Enti ɛyɛ wo.
And it’s good now.	Na ɛyɛ papa mprempren.
He looked at me with interest.	Ɔde anigye hwɛɛ me.
This city is famous for its fun atmosphere.	Saa kurow yi agye din wɔ anigye tebea a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho.
There should be more details later this week.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ akyiri yi dapɛn yi.
There was another problem.	Ná ɔhaw foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
I am very sorry for you.	Mepa wo kyɛw kɛse.
The use of information.	Nsɛm a wɔde di dwuma.
He nodded wisely.	Ɔde nyansa bɔɔ ne ti.
That’s the case here.	Saa na ɛte wɔ ha.
That was never true.	Ná ɛno nyɛ nokware da.
I have no idea how well this works.	Minnim sɛnea eyi yɛ adwuma yiye no ho adwene biara.
That was information he could use.	Ná ɛno yɛ nsɛm a obetumi de adi dwuma.
I drove for hours.	Mede nnɔnhwerew pii kaa kar.
Most of them are not true at all.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara nyɛ nokware koraa.
Which seemed like no easy task.	Nea na ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani gyee ho paa.
We can agree on that.	Yebetumi ayɛ adwene wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
It wasn’t that she didn’t like the man, even she didn’t.	Na ɛnyɛ sɛ na n’ani nnye ɔbarima no ho, mpo n’ani nnye ho.
This is not very surprising.	Eyi nyɛ nwonwa kɛse.
This is why the mind works so well.	Eyi nti na adwene no yɛ adwuma saa no.
And in everyone else.	Na wɔ obiara mu.
We got this one.	Yɛn nsa kaa eyi.
They are not beautiful.	Wɔn ho nyɛ fɛ.
It will be easier.	Ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
And he was not unpopular there.	Na na ɛnyɛ obi a nkurɔfo ani nnye ne ho wɔ hɔ.
This is you for me, me and him.	Eyi ne wo ma me, me ne no.
The issue is complicated.	Asɛm no mu yɛ den.
I'm sure that would be great.	Migye di sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ kɛse.
Except that it is.	Gye sɛ ɛte saa.
This is something you don’t want to do.	Eyi yɛ biribi a wompɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Put everything on the bed.	Fa biribiara to mpa so.
Everything but everything.	Biribiara gye biribiara.
Many people were able to do this in a short period of time.	Nnipa pii tumi yɛɛ eyi na wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
But it didn’t.	Nanso anyɛ saa.
Don’t use them.	Mfa wɔn nni dwuma.
You and you will pretend it will be okay.	Wo ne wo bɛyɛ wo ho sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
I hope this was enjoyable.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ na eyi yɛ anigye.
This is a wonderful document.	Eyi yɛ krataa a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
The car drove to the door.	Kar no de kar no kɔɔ ɔpon no ano.
He is weak.	Ɔyɛ mmerɛw.
He was also absent for a while.	Ná ɔno nso nni hɔ kakra.
I know it’s just a matter of time.	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ bere ho asɛm ara kwa.
We’ve even put prices on everything.	Yɛde nneɛma bo mpo ahyɛ biribiara ho.
I can’t give you anything.	Mintumi mfa hwee mma wo.
I know his mother.	Minim ne maame.
He had his good days and he had his bad days.	Ná ɔwɔ ne nna pa na na ɔwɔ ne nna bɔne.
You might even say something.	Ebia wobɛka biribi mpo.
. . . .	.
He didn't know he was.	Ná onnim sɛ ɔno ne saa.
My roommate did.	Nea me ne no te dan mu no yɛɛ saa.
Somewhere, sometime out there.	Baabi, bere bi wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
The price of this product is awesome!	Saa ade yi bo yɛ hu!
I’m very, very happy.	M’ani agye yiye paa.
There is no one else here.	Obi foforo biara nni ha.
This is their last chance.	Eyi ne wɔn hokwan a etwa to.
I understand what is going on.	Mete nea ɛrekɔ so no ase.
Do this yourself, at least today.	Yɛ eyi ankasa, anyɛ yiye koraa no nnɛ.
All I know is that.	Nea minim ara ne sɛ.
But that was a lie.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ atoro.
Your mother was beautiful.	Ná wo maame ho yɛ fɛ.
I was new to this.	Ná meyɛ foforo wɔ eyi mu.
People just don’t get it.	Nkurɔfo nnya bi kɛkɛ.
Many, many, many of them.	Wɔn mu pii, pii, pii.
You seem to be doing really well.	Ɛte sɛ nea woreyɛ yiye ankasa.
He never wants you.	Ɔmpɛ wo da.
Not that he ever will.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa da.
It was a wonderful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It was just the two of them now.	Ná ɛyɛ wɔn baanu pɛ mprempren.
Everyone was amazed at the phenomenon.	Obiara ho dwiriw no wɔ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa no ho.
I want to see him at work.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu no wɔ adwumam.
And as we treat them, they treat us.	Na sɛnea yɛyɛ wɔn ho adwuma no, saa ara na wɔyɛ yɛn ho adwuma.
There was no water.	Ná nsu a ɛwɔ hɔ no nni hɔ.
Under the bed.	Mpa no ase.
The legs are.	Nan yɛ.
That should mean something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno kyerɛ biribi.
He put his hand on the window sill, and leaned down.	Ɔde ne nsa too mfɛnsere no ano, na ɔde ne ho too fam.
Everyone moves away.	Obiara tu kɔ baabi foforo.
My mom told me about it.	Me maame kaa ho asɛm kyerɛɛ me.
All his eyes were fixed on her.	N’ani nyinaa hwɛɛ no ​​denneennen.
But we have someone who disagrees.	Nanso yɛwɔ obi a ɔne no nyɛ adwene.
It was absolutely amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
It’s terrible for me.	Ɛyɛ hu ma me.
Tell me something else.	Ka biribi foforo kyerɛ me.
Every house has a front door.	Ofie biara wɔ anim pon.
But he did, anyway.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ saa, ɔkwan biara so.
For many reasons, indeed.	Nneɛma pii nti, ampa.
The view is awe-inspiring.	Adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
You are very good.	Woyɛ papa paa.
This should sound pretty amazing.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
Everyone liked them.	Obiara ani gyee wɔn ho.
It’s a thing of the past.	Ɛyɛ nea atwam.
If possible, have the party outside.	Sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye a, yɛ apontow no wɔ abɔnten.
It’s not pretty at all.	Ɛnyɛ fɛ koraa.
There is no mistake there.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ wɔ hɔ.
This kid had a great year for us.	Saa abofra yi nyaa afe kɛse maa yɛn.
Everything is new and in excellent condition.	Biribiara yɛ foforo na ɛwɔ tebea pa mu.
That’s why we’re here.	Ɛno nti na yɛwɔ ha no.
It was exciting at the time.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye saa bere no.
It’s not about sex.	Ɛnyɛ nna ho asɛm.
That’s why it’s so popular.	Ɛno nti na agye din no.
The imagination got the better of me.	Adwene a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho no nyaa me so nkonim.
However, it is not him.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɔno.
What food, how much food.	Aduan bɛn, aduan dodow ahe.
It’s not a new thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade foforo.
It’s on mine.	Ɛyɛ me de no so.
Everything else is easy.	Biribiara a aka no yɛ mmerɛw.
We hope you enjoy working with us!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho sɛ wo ne yɛn bɛyɛ adwuma!.
Maybe someone else can.	Ebia obi foforo betumi ayɛ saa.
He would just go away.	Anka ɔbɛkɔ ara kwa.
The content is amazing.	Nsɛm a ɛwɔ mu no yɛ nwonwa.
The testing information includes a number of test procedures.	Sɔhwɛ ho nsɛm no de sɔhwɛ nhyehyɛe ahorow bi ka ho.
You see strange but beautiful things there.	Wuhu nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa nanso ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ hɔ.
We’re friends, which is a good thing.	Yɛyɛ nnamfo, a ɛyɛ ade pa.
It’s a good book.	Ɛyɛ nhoma pa.
Some things were less important, and some things were more important.	Ná nneɛma bi ho nhia pii, na nneɛma bi nso ho hia kɛse.
I couldn’t do them.	Na mintumi nyɛ wɔn.
It’s good in a way.	Ɛyɛ papa wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
You either like it or you don’t.	W’ani gye ho anaasɛ w’ani nnye ho.
And he knows me.	Na onim me.
Part of it closed.	Ne fã bi too mu.
He thought he could help.	Ná osusuw sɛ obetumi aboa.
Each of them has a time.	Wɔn mu biara wɔ bere bi.
I'll take you to the city.	Mede wo bɛkɔ kurow no mu.
I tell them.	Meka kyerɛ wɔn.
I also like their names.	M’ani gye wɔn din nso ho.
Does anyone have any idea why this is happening.	So obi wɔ adwene bi wɔ nea enti a eyi rekɔ so no ho.
You know how this is going to end.	Wunim sɛnea eyi bɛba awiei.
But, you know,.	Nanso, wunim,.
No one wants to do this job.	Obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa adwuma yi.
This may have to be copied annually.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi ho mfonini afe biara.
The two of them came back to the table.	Wɔn baanu san baa pon no so.
The time has come.	Bere no adu.
Another mistake, too.	Mfomso foforo nso.
But the music had to be my favorite.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ nnwom no yɛ nea m’ani gye ho kɛse.
Be careful, too.	Hwɛ yiye.
And so do your children.	Na saa ara na wo mma nso yɛ.
How much money do you have on you?	Sika ahe na wowɔ wɔ wo so?
That doesn’t mean there’s no danger in this approach.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ asiane biara nni saa kwan yi so.
But I’m alone.	Nanso me nkutoo.
Either way whatever.	Ɔkwan biara so nea ɛte biara.
The truth is absolutely clear.	Nokware no mu da hɔ koraa.
If you want, we can do it here.	Sɛ wopɛ a, yebetumi ayɛ wɔ ha.
This is not a mistake.	Eyi nyɛ mfomso.
There are many issues.	Nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ.
He was doing well at the time.	Ná ɔreyɛ yiye saa bere no.
He could do it all.	Ná obetumi ayɛ ne nyinaa.
I saw a cat sitting at the window.	Mihuu ɔkraman bi a ɔte mfɛnsere no ano.
Add more water if necessary.	Sɛ ɛho hia a, fa nsu foforo ka ho.
It was beautiful in the background.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ akyi hɔ.
This was very true.	Ná eyi yɛ nokware kɛse.
The first step can be planning.	Ade a edi kan no betumi ayɛ nhyehyɛe.
Or what’s left of him, anyway.	Anaasɛ nea aka wɔ ne ho, ɔkwan biara so.
The things in the house.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ fie hɔ.
However, this is not really true.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ nokware ankasa.
It’s all then.	Ɛyɛ ne nyinaa saa bere no.
That will work for me.	Ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma ama me.
You talk to them well.	Wo ne wɔn kasa yiye.
We are here in the course.	Yɛwɔ ha wɔ adesua no mu.
You have to work on it every day.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho adwuma da biara da.
He knew her well.	Ná onim no yiye.
You go tonight.	Wo kɔ anadwo yi.
And there was the food.	Na aduan no nso wɔ hɔ.
That should end this article.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno de asɛm yi ba awiei.
One you might like.	Biako a ebia w’ani begye ho.
For us, it was never a bad thing though.	Wɔ yɛn fam no, na ɛnyɛ ade bɔne da nanso.
What? 	Dɛn?
I thought we would use your car.	Misusuwii sɛ yɛde wo kar no bedi dwuma.
Without water, life is impossible	Sɛ nsu nni hɔ a, nkwa ntumi nyɛ yiye
You being in the car.	Wo a wowɔ kar no mu.
Or his name, at least.	Anaasɛ ne din, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
But this is possible.	Nanso eyi betumi aba.
Be careful with your words.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ wo nsɛm a wode bedi dwuma no ho.
In the presence of the people.	Wɔ nnipa anim.
Indeed.	Ampa ara.
I hope for the better.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ papa bɛba.
Now the situation seems similar.	Mprempren ɛte sɛ nea tebea no te sɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
Almost no one believes this.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara nnye saa asɛm yi nni.
The back window overlooked water.	Ná mfɛnsere a ɛwɔ akyi no hwɛ nsu so.
It filled up quickly.	Nnipa hyɛɛ mu ma ntɛmntɛm.
The water was rough that night.	Ná nsu no ano yɛ den saa anadwo no.
We should do the same thing.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa ara.
This attitude is not wrong in itself.	Saa su yi ankasa nyɛ bɔne.
However, this is as important to the film as it is to you.	Nanso, eyi ho hia sini no te sɛ nea wo ho hia no.
I finally found the truth.	Awiei koraa no, mihuu nokware no.
For them, that means a car.	Wɔ wɔn fam no, ɛno kyerɛ kar.
As you wish.	Sɛnea wopɛ.
The night came.	Anadwo baa.
But somehow.	Nanso ɔkwan bi so.
That’s how they do it.	Saa na wɔyɛ no.
The city was filled with joy and happiness.	Ná anigye ne anigye ahyɛ kurow no mu ma.
Nevertheless, he never spoke to me again.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɔne me ankasa bio.
So, whatever you do.	Enti, nea wobɛyɛ biara.
They both make mistakes.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa di mfomso.
That is a very complicated and unsightly thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade a ɛyɛ den yiye na ɛnyɛ fɛ.
Except that it is.	Gye sɛ ɛte saa.
We are all very concerned about these issues.	Yɛn nyinaa haw kɛse wɔ nsɛm yi ho.
In his eyes.	Wɔ n’ani so.
I had to stay the course.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so tra ɔkwan no so.
And maybe he will.	Na ebia ɔbɛyɛ saa.
Police made the best of it.	Polisifo yɛɛ nea eye sen biara.
And a lot of fun too.	Na anigye pii nso.
I know how that works.	Minim sɛnea ɛno yɛ adwuma.
It was full of money.	Ná sika ahyɛ mu ma.
It was a coincidence.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a esii kwa.
I was so excited.	Ná m’ani agye yiye.
Most people haven’t.	Nkurɔfo dodow no ara nyɛɛ saa.
They are among my favorite movies.	Wɔka sini ahorow a m’ani gye ho paa no ho.
I guess that’s part of the fun.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ anigye no fã.
I heard it recently.	Metee no nnansa yi ara.
I understand these people.	Mete saa nkurɔfo yi ase.
He could only watch.	Ná obetumi ahwɛ nkutoo.
They may also be offered.	Ebia wɔde bɛma nso.
It feels solid, and good.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ den, na ɛyɛ papa.
Plenty of water in the summer.	Nsu pii wɔ awɔw bere mu.
Hats always had their way.	Ná kyɛw wɔ ne kwan bere nyinaa.
Imagine that you are not.	Fa no sɛ wonyɛ wo.
I believe every man does.	Migye di sɛ ɔbarima biara yɛ saa.
It was very impressive.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
The room is filled with hot water.	Nsu a ɛyɛ hyew ahyɛ dan no mu ma.
But, and that’s why.	Nanso, na ɛno nti.
It was very impressive.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
Which is a really big deal.	Nea ɛyɛ ade kɛse ankasa.
The real problem is the users.	Ɔhaw ankasa ne wɔn a wɔde di dwuma no.
If you say that.	Sɛ woka saa a.
The story ends at this point.	Asɛm no ba awiei wɔ saa bere yi mu.
We can speed things up.	Yebetumi ama nsɛm ayɛ ntɛm.
You work within the system.	Woyɛ adwuma wɔ nhyehyɛe no mu.
Includes a few words and beautiful pictures.	Nsɛm kakra ne mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ ka ho.
Surely there might be some food left over.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ebia aduan bi bɛka.
These tests had failed to detect it, he says	Ɔka sɛ na sɔhwɛ ahorow yi antumi anhu
As you can see, there is something for everyone!.	Sɛnea wubetumi ahu no, biribi wɔ hɔ ma obiara!.
I feel like I have nothing.	Mete nka sɛ me ho nni hwee.
As children, they rely on it.	Sɛ mmofra no, wɔde wɔn ho to so.
I know when it is.	Minim bere a ɛyɛ.
I glanced out my window.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ me mfɛnsere mu.
It seemed fairly simple.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
But it was there.	Nanso na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I have to sleep.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda.
And that is now.	Na ɛno ne mprempren.
But he certainly looked amazing.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ne ho yɛ nwonwa.
Not without the man.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔbarima no nka ho.
This usually happens in some years.	Eyi taa ba wɔ mfe bi mu.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni ho.
They give it to him.	Wɔn ma no.
That wasn’t really true.	Ná ɛno nyɛ nokware ankasa.
He knew she was beautiful.	Ná onim sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It wasn’t pretty.	Ná ɛnyɛ fɛ.
You don’t have to, anymore.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa, bio.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
None of this is new.	Eyi mu biara nyɛ ade foforo.
Some things are important.	Nneɛma bi ho hia.
There was no doubt about what he felt.	Ná akyinnye biara nni ho wɔ nea ɔte nka no ho.
The whole concept is wrong.	Adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ no nyinaa yɛ mfomso.
That’s how businesses work.	Saa na nnwuma fa so yɛ adwuma.
There may be a number of reasons.	Ebia nneɛma ahorow bi nti na ɛte saa.
Freebies do not have to be expensive.	Ɛho nhia sɛ nneɛma a wɔde ma kwa no bo yɛ den.
And it’s not you.	Na ɛnyɛ wo.
It seemed unlikely.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
This was the job he wanted.	Eyi ne adwuma a na ɔpɛ.
The book is like any other evening book.	Nhoma no te sɛ anwummere nhoma foforo biara.
Try to use all the packages.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wode nneɛma a wɔde ahyɛ mu no nyinaa bedi dwuma.
I wonder when this will happen.	Misusuw bere bɛn na eyi bɛba ho.
I would have gone with the boy, if it were up to me.	Anka me ne abarimaa no bɛkɔ, sɛ ɛyɛ me de a.
So one way is not the same as the other.	Enti ɔkwan biako ne ɔkwan foforo no nyɛ pɛ.
And yet it’s so hard.	Na nanso ɛyɛ den saa.
Always.	Bere nyinaa.
Like today.	Te sɛ nnɛ.
At least in appearance.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ sɛnea ɛte no mu.
There was nothing he could say.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi aka.
She put her hair back.	Ɔde ne ti nhwi no sii akyi.
I do, you know.	Meyɛ, wunim.
Again it is just absolutely amazing.	Bio nso ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa ara kwa.
She's too pretty for him.	Ɔyɛ fɛ dodo ma no.
Do your best to do it.	Yɛ nea wubetumi biara.
He was just a boy.	Ná ɔyɛ abarimaa bi kɛkɛ.
Every person every day.	Onipa biara da biara.
You need to do it quickly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no ntɛm.
It will be one of the years.	Ɛbɛyɛ mfe no mu biako.
That is their vital power.	Ɛno ne wɔn tumi a ɛho hia no.
The children were amazed at the sight.	Ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa no maa mmofra no ho dwiriw wɔn.
That’s how the police found him.	Saa na polisifo huu no.
There was literally nothing at home.	Ná biribiara nni fie ankasa.
We had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Or at least he says he is.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɔka sɛ ɔte saa.
This helps.	Eyi mmoa.
There is not much you can do.	Nneɛma pii nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
People just didn’t know him.	Ná nkurɔfo nnim no kɛkɛ.
I never even knew him.	Ná minnim no mpo da.
He doesn't know any better.	Onnim nea eye sen saa.
The rest was pretty easy.	Ná nea aka no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
This couldn’t be further from the truth.	Eyi ntumi nkɔ akyiri mfi nokware no ho.
At least that was something.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛno yɛ biribi.
Many animals were afraid of man.	Ná mmoa pii suro onipa.
Hope you are doing well.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ woreyɛ yiye.
Does a cat hit the moon?	So ɔkraman bi bɔ ɔsram no?
He is such a character.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔte saa.
See what else is available.	Hwɛ nneɛma foforo a ɛwɔ hɔ.
None of this matters if you believe you have power.	Eyi mu biara ho nhia sɛ wugye di sɛ wowɔ tumi a.
It’s what we have to do anyway.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ɔkwan biara so.
And it was quick.	Na ɛyɛ ntɛm.
They were put there.	Wɔde too hɔ.
But many of us can’t.	Nanso yɛn pii ntumi nyɛ saa.
The letter is a fake.	Krataa no yɛ atoro.
See what you believe.	Hwɛ nea wugye di.
And how it is.	Na sɛnea ɛte.
I had done it for me more than for anything else.	Ná mayɛ saa ama me sen biribi foforo biara nti.
But financial support is a must.	Nanso sika fam mmoa yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
The man nodded, stepping to the side.	Ɔbarima no de ne ti too fam, na ɔde ne nan kɔɔ nkyɛn.
You can come with me if you want.	Wubetumi ne me aba sɛ wopɛ a.
There is a lot of interest in it.	Anigye kɛse wɔ ho.
No one has anything.	Obiara nni hwee.
In the school.	Wɔ sukuu no mu.
It was much nicer in person.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ sen saa koraa wɔ ankasa mu.
Thank the music.	Da nnwom no ase.
Whether you have time, do something else.	Sɛ́ ebia wowɔ bere no, yɛ ade foforo.
Direct him to me.	Kyerɛ no kwan kɔ me nkyɛn.
One of these days.	Nna yi mu biako.
We have that plan.	Yɛwɔ saa nhyehyɛe no.
I had no more words to say.	Ná minni nsɛm a mɛka bio.
I almost did you.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ meyɛɛ wo.
It’s not hard enough.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I like it even more this way.	M’ani gye ho kɛse mpo wɔ saa kwan yi so.
Fortunately, this is quite possible.	Nea eye ne sɛ, eyi betumi ayɛ yiye koraa.
There is no need for him to do so.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I think on my feet and I can be strong as well.	Misusuw nneɛma ho wɔ me nan so na metumi ayɛ den nso.
Both left shortly after dawn.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa fii hɔ anɔpa akyi bere tiaa bi.
I can only have a few things.	Metumi anya nneɛma kakraa bi pɛ.
It was kind of good for him.	Ná ɛyɛ nea eye ma no ɔkwan bi so.
Some things were more important.	Ná nneɛma bi ho hia kɛse.
I love everything about it.	M’ani gye ho biribiara ho.
I am still quite busy.	Meda so ara wɔ adagyew koraa.
He makes mistakes.	Odi mfomso.
But look inside the car.	Nanso hwɛ kar no mu.
He just had a bad idea about the whole situation.	Ná ɔwɔ tebea no nyinaa ho adwene bɔne ara kwa.
Go into the other room.	Kɔ dan foforo no mu.
He wanted to be more popular.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho kɛse.
So there is no problem.	Enti ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
Most of our group were very excited about it.	Ná yɛn kuw no mu dodow no ara ani agye ho yiye.
I need to watch a movie.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ sini bi.
But not for this game.	Nanso ɛnyɛ agoru yi nti.
He knew immediately that it had to be true.	Ná onim ntɛm ara sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
He lives near the city.	Ɔte bɛn kurow no.
Remove his name.	Yi ne din fi hɔ.
The ride there was not pleasant.	Ná kar a wɔde traa hɔ no nyɛ anigye.
We’ll both be happy.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa ani begye.
I was even a little dating.	Ná me ne obi abɔ kakra mpo.
Good girl!	Abeawa pa!
Not because it matters so much.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛho hia kɛse nti.
He really knew the game.	Ná onim agoru no ankasa.
Anyway, this man had to go.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbarima yi kɔ.
That’s not the first time it’s done that.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea edi kan a ɛyɛ saa.
To touch him with your hands.	Sɛ wode wo nsa bɛka no.
We’re really just friends.	Yɛyɛ nnamfo ara kwa ankasa.
I feel really bad.	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ bɔne ankasa.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
His head hurt too much.	Ne ti yɛɛ no ​​yaw dodo.
And much, much more.	Na pii, pii nso ka ho.
I don’t know if that has anything to do with it.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno ne no wɔ biribi yɛ anaa.
I can have a different perspective.	Metumi anya adwene foforo.
I have a good job.	Mewɔ adwuma pa.
I make games they like.	Meyɛ agoru ahorow a wɔn ani gye ho.
For many, though, sex can be just a pleasure.	Nanso, wɔ nnipa pii fam no, nna betumi ayɛ anigye ara kwa.
It still doesn’t.	Ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
The song was amazing.	Na dwom no yɛ nwonwa.
Just tell me what’s going on with you.	Ka nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ wo ho no kyerɛ me kɛkɛ.
I understand the point.	Mete asɛm no ase.
Eliminate everyone at the same time.	Yi obiara fi hɔ bere koro mu.
Not a bad morning job.	Ɛnyɛ anɔpa adwuma bɔne.
I have no other real interest.	Minni anigye ankasa foforo biara.
Take a quick look at the table below.	Hwɛ pon a ɛwɔ ase hɔ no ntɛm ara.
That’s why we’re here.	Ɛno nti na yɛwɔ ha no.
But it’s fast.	Nanso ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
There was so much to do.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I forget the last name.	Me werɛ fi din a etwa to no.
In a short time.	Bere tiaa bi mu.
It seemed familiar to me.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea minim no yiye.
It’s a house.	Ɛyɛ ofie.
When does the next meeting take place?	Bere bɛn na nhyiam a edi hɔ no kɔ so?
In other words, believe why people say stay.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, gye nea enti a nkurɔfo ka tra no di.
It’s what you do.	Ɛyɛ nea woyɛ.
Or at least that’s what everyone assumed.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne nea obiara faa no sɛ.
It may be true that those things are impossible.	Ebia ɛyɛ nokware sɛ saa nneɛma no ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Remember that	Kae sɛ .
Very little at all.	Kakraa bi koraa.
Their own children.	Wɔn ankasa mma.
This is something new for me.	Eyi yɛ ade foforo ma me.
I find it really interesting.	Mihu no sɛ ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
That is not true at all.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware koraa.
You are in way over your head here.	Wowɔ kwan so wɔ wo ti so wɔ ha.
No windows, even.	Mfɛnsere biara nni hɔ, mpo.
We have the ability to create.	Yɛwɔ tumi a yɛde bɛbɔ ade.
But he had to say something.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka asɛm bi.
Remove it from the mu.	Yi fi mu.
This must be a mistake!	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ eyi yɛ mfomso!
Not everyone can do what you do.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na obetumi ayɛ nea woyɛ no.
Maybe, in a few years, there might be a way.	Ebia, wɔ mfe kakraa bi akyi no, ebia na ɔkwan bi wɔ hɔ.
If you don’t.	Sɛ wonyɛ saa a.
My mom did what school didn’t do.	Me maame yɛɛ nea sukuu anyɛ no.
Accidents plague this route.	Akwanhyia ahorow haw ɔkwan yi so.
He wrapped his arms around her.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne mu.
I can do the same thing.	Metumi ayɛ ade koro no ara.
The next, he was gone.	Nea edi hɔ no, na onni hɔ bio.
This street is very crowded this evening.	Abɔnten yi so ayɛ ma kɛse anwummere yi.
There is nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
I drove home.	Mede kar kɔɔ fie.
I could leave now.	Ná metumi afi hɔ mprempren.
This is my favorite time of day.	Eyi ne bere a m’ani gye ho paa wɔ da no mu.
Like really hot.	Te sɛ nea ɛyɛ hyew ankasa.
Most of the time it feels like nothing.	Mpɛn pii no ɛte sɛ nea hwee nni hɔ.
I want to work on things.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nneɛma ho adwuma.
But please be careful.	Nanso mesrɛ wo, hwɛ yiye.
I guess that’s mine, though.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne me de, nanso.
I never knew it.	Ná minnim da.
Both statements are true.	Nsɛm abien no nyinaa yɛ nokware.
They are real things.	Wɔyɛ nneɛma ankasa.
So he did that.	Enti ɔyɛɛ saa.
However, it was necessary.	Nanso, na ɛho hia.
They do it every year and they love it.	Wɔyɛ no afe biara na wɔn ani gye ho.
And he wanted to do something.	Na na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
These elements are used to make the music.	Wɔde saa nneɛma yi na ɛyɛ nnwom no.
That was the point, it seemed.	Na ɛno ne asɛm no, na ɛte sɛ nea.
In the past, I couldn’t do that.	Bere bi a atwam no, na mintumi nyɛ saa.
Try telling that to a group of friends.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wobɛka saa akyerɛ wo nnamfo kuw bi.
I keep doing that.	Mekɔ so yɛ saa.
I thought about what I would do.	Misusuw nea mɛyɛ ho.
You have to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I think it has to be you.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo.
It was very beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
It seemed even easier now.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse mpo mprempren.
So here is the before and after.	Enti nea edi kan ne akyi no ni.
He was tomorrow.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔkyena.
It was cold here.	Na awɔw wom wɔ ha.
She works in our house.	Ɔyɛ adwuma wɔ yɛn fie.
It had been going on for a long time.	Ná ɛrekɔ so akyɛ.
He knew them by name.	Ná ɔde wɔn din nim wɔn.
I’ve created them.	Mewɔ wo.
Interesting story.	Asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
The dog may come at any time.	Ebia ɔkraman no bɛba bere biara.
He wants to be with a beautiful girl.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne abeawa bi a ne ho yɛ fɛ tra.
And you are also	Na wo nso woyɛ .
It’s pretty long.	Ɛyɛ tenten yiye.
The people are real here.	Nkurɔfo no yɛ nnipa ankasa wɔ ha.
I added it just in case though.	Mede kaa ho sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛbɛyɛ yiye nanso.
He did it well.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​yiye.
This is the perfect story.	Eyi ne asɛm a edi mũ.
Not this one either.	Ɛnyɛ eyi nso.
Not even, like, close.	Ɛnyɛ mpo, te sɛ, bɛn.
I think it’s a bad thing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ ade bɔne.
He didn’t want to be a part of it.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ne fã.
I was shocked.	Ná me ho dwiriw me.
Don’t like or dislike it.	Mma w’ani nnye ho anaasɛ wompɛ.
It was never like that before.	Kan no na ɛnte saa da.
That, of course, is human.	Ɛno, ampa, ɛyɛ onipa.
I never wanted you, you know.	Na mempɛ wo da, wunim.
So just accept the problem and be honest.	Enti gye ɔhaw no kɛkɛ na ka nokware.
Use what you think will work best.	Fa nea wususuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma yiye no di dwuma.
He didn’t know that.	Ná onnim saa.
That was his first thought.	Ɛno ne nea edi kan a osusuw ho.
So we can never know.	Enti yɛrentumi nhu da.
I touched his hand.	Mede me nsa kaa ne nsa.
You can never be sure of the situation.	Worentumi nhu tebea no yiye da.
But I am terrible.	Nanso me ho yɛ hu.
From here to there.	Fi ha kɔ hɔ.
I didn’t know what I was going to do out there.	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
And it’s certainly not an idea.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ adwene.
It must be him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno.
When the man was doing so well in tests.	Bere a na ɔbarima no reyɛ yiye saa wɔ sɔhwɛ ahorow mu no.
You’ll be interested.	W’ani begye ho.
This is a good house.	Eyi yɛ ofie pa.
There is no such opportunity.	Hokwan a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ.
A group has a name.	Kuw bi wɔ din.
That didn’t work this time.	Ɛno anyɛ adwuma saa bere yi.
He knows what he can do.	Onim nea obetumi ayɛ.
The street was the same.	Ná abɔnten no nso te saa ara.
This may just be the most important.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ nea ɛho hia sen biara ara kwa.
There was a severe water shortage.	Ná nsu ho ayɛ na kɛse.
It seems pretty obvious.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛda adi yiye.
Many things happened.	Nneɛma pii sii.
It’s my problem.	Ɛyɛ me haw.
His hands were full.	Ná ne nsa ayɛ ma.
We ended up with something of our own.	Yɛde yɛn ankasa biribi baa awiei.
The test is expensive.	Sɔhwɛ no bo yɛ den.
It was a painful time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ yaw.
She wants to make clothes herself.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa yɛ ntade.
The group told him that they did not like his idea.	Kuw no ka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ wɔn ani nnye n’adwene no ho.
What I react to is completely human.	Nea meyɛ ho ade no yɛ onipa koraa.
This is a very serious threat to them.	Eyi yɛ asiane kɛse koraa ma wɔn.
Maybe he’ll be interested in that.	Ebia n’ani begye saa asɛm no ho.
He is a very popular person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔpɛ nnipa pii.
Put on your indoor shoes.	Hyɛ wo mpaboa a ɛwɔ dan mu no.
I think he's right there.	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ ara.
I think more than anyone else in the house.	Misusuw nneɛma ho sen obiara a ɔwɔ fie hɔ.
No doubt he had forgotten something important.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ne werɛ afi biribi a ɛho hia.
There are two things.	Nneɛma abien na ɛwɔ hɔ.
That group is great.	Saa kuw no yɛ kɛse.
And he nodded his head.	Na ɔde ne ti too fam.
But we need to put that to good use.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde saa asɛm no di dwuma yiye.
I am like my mother, and I close my words tightly.	Mete sɛ me maame, na mede me nsɛm to mu denneennen.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia biara.
Maybe that’s all there was to it.	Ebia ɛno ara ne nea na ɛwɔ hɔ.
He did it better than anyone else.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​yiye sen obiara.
There is no better time than right now.	Bere biara nni hɔ a eye sen mprempren yi ara.
Everything on the table.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ pon no so.
Two and a half years.	Mfe abien ne fã.
I don’t think we would bring that up.	Minsusuw sɛ anka yɛde saa asɛm no bɛba.
And the next, and the next.	Na nea edi hɔ no, ne nea edi hɔ no.
Something terrible happened.	Ade bi a ɛyɛ hu sii.
This was the program the children knew about and were excited about.	Eyi ne nhyehyɛe a na mmofra no nim ho asɛm na na wɔn ani agye.
We have a story for this.	Yɛwɔ asɛm bi ma eyi.
He lives very close to me.	Ɔte bɛn me koraa.
This task is very unpleasant.	Saa adwuma yi yɛ nea ɛnyɛ anigye koraa.
He points to the road.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛ ɔkwan no so.
That wasn’t the first thing he told her.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne ade a edi kan a ɔka kyerɛɛ no.
This is the first problem.	Eyi ne ɔhaw a edi kan.
We need to do things right.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nneɛma yiye.
These words don’t really tell you.	Saa nsɛm yi nkyerɛ wo ankasa.
The dog chases the dog.	Ɔkraman no taa kraman no.
There are good jobs and bad jobs.	Nnwuma pa ne nnwuma bɔne wɔ hɔ.
The child looked at his mother from behind.	Abofra no fii ne maame akyi hwɛɛ no.
And indeed, he did.	Na ampa ara, ɔyɛɛ saa.
The phone is ringing.	Telefon no rebɔ.
That was the case now.	Saa na na ɛte mprempren.
The work you have to do.	Adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I know we are friends.	Minim sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo.
Give them fun!.	Ma wɔn anigye!.
That’s what’s happened before.	Ɛno na asi pɛn.
All eyes were on him.	Ná wɔn nyinaa ani wɔ ne so.
Nobody gives a shit about us.	Obiara mfa yɛn ho asɛm biara mma.
Nothing wrong with that though.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ a ɛnyɛ ɛno de, nanso.
Good news, bad news, and very terrible news.	Nsɛm pa, nsɛm bɔne, ne nsɛm a ɛyɛ hu yiye.
I think about him a lot.	Misusuw ne ho kɛse.
That is not a problem.	Ɛno nyɛ ɔhaw biara.
There is that you know little.	Ɛwɔ hɔ sɛ wunim kakraa bi.
I was hoping that.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ.
Take it easy on yourself.	Fa no mmerɛw ma wo ho.
Now it looks like any other house.	Seesei ɛte sɛ ofie foforo biara.
Your other two friends were in the background.	Ná wo nnamfo baanu a aka no wɔ akyi.
And we both know why.	Na yɛn baanu nyinaa nim nea enti a ɛte saa.
We had a three-day weekend ahead of us.	Ná yɛwɔ nnansa dapɛn awiei wɔ yɛn anim.
He doesn’t know his part.	Onnim ne fã no.
For the sake of his people.	Ne nkurɔfo nti.
Fortunately, the danger has passed.	Nea eye ne sɛ, asiane no atwam.
I used to want what you had.	Kan no na mepɛ nea wowɔ.
I can 't quite figure it out.	Mintumi 'ntumi nsusuw ho yiye.
I have already done that and still no luck.	Mayɛ saa dedaw na meda so ara nni anigye biara.
Most believe he is innocent.	Dodow no ara gye di sɛ ne ho nni asɛm.
I thought about that for a few days.	Misusuw saa asɛm no ho nna kakraa bi.
It would be great if you could help.	Sɛ wubetumi aboa a anka ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
I want to talk to you about your wife.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa fa wo yere ho.
I don’t like them.	M’ani nnye wɔn ho.
And so was he, too.	Na saa ara na na ɔno nso te.
So long as you invest in yourself.	Enti bere tenten a wode sika hyɛ wo ho mu no.
Just for the present.	Mprempren de ara kwa.
It’s very very difficult.	Ɛyɛ den yiye paa.
This bothered me a lot.	Eyi haw me kɛse.
It’s a real job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ankasa.
It’s not mine, this was my home.	Ɛnyɛ me de, na eyi ne me fie.
I told him that.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​saa.
And that somehow makes him more of a target.	Na ɛno ma ɔkwan bi so no ma ɔyɛ obi a wɔde n’ani asi n’ani so kɛse.
You can donate books to the school.	Wubetumi de nhoma ama sukuu no.
He is sitting on my bed.	Ɔte me mpa so.
I guess nothing about him should surprise me now.	Misusuw sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ne ho biribiara yɛ me nwonwa mprempren.
We had the time then.	Ná yɛwɔ bere no saa bere no.
It was in the evening.	Ná ɛyɛ anwummere.
No work, no infrastructure.	Adwuma biara nni hɔ, nneɛma a wɔde yɛ adwuma biara nni hɔ.
Love of music is a human trait.	Nnwom ho anigye yɛ onipa su.
But he knows it.	Nanso onim.
The picture, please.	Mfonini no, mesrɛ wo.
Again, that’s just it.	Bio nso, ɛno ara kwa.
For providing materials for the tests.	Ama nneɛma a wɔde bɛyɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow no ama.
Their faces were blank.	Ná wɔn anim nyɛ hwee.
This road is a great bike path.	Saa kwan yi yɛ sakre kwan kɛse bi.
There is no way.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ.
It is what they do from now on that matters.	Ɛyɛ nea wɔyɛ fi mprempren rekɔ no na ɛho hia.
In the absence of the previous.	Sɛ nea atwam no nni hɔ a.
No one ever leaves.	Obi mfi hɔ da.
Anyway, thanks again.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, meda wo ase bio.
He used the information in it.	Ɔde nsɛm a ɛwɔ mu no dii dwuma.
Just another year.	Afe foforo ara kwa.
And in this way too.	Na saa kwan yi so nso.
But for me it was, in a weird way.	Nanso me fam no, na ɛte saa, wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
He was too strong, too fast.	Ná ne ho yɛ den dodo, na ɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
That’s really hard.	Ɛno yɛ den ankasa.
Lots of hot water.	Nsu a ɛyɛ hyew pii.
I live for food.	Mete ase ma aduan.
It’s going in the right direction.	Ɛrekɔ ɔkwan pa so.
There are animals.	Mmoa wɔ hɔ.
However, the money was huge.	Nanso, na sika no yɛ kɛse.
It is a very dangerous game.	Ɛyɛ agoru a asiane wom kɛse.
And very many of them don’t.	Na wɔn mu pii paa nso nyɛ saa.
You need to know that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu saa.
In that way, it was just like home.	Wɔ saa kwan no so no, na ɛte sɛ ofie ara pɛ.
You may be interested in this.	Ebia w’ani begye eyi ho.
Not even one of them.	Ɛnyɛ biako mpo.
The prospects for the weekend are not good.	Dapɛn awiei no ho anidaso nyɛ papa.
Which is a lot.	Nea ɛyɛ pii.
It was a cute boy.	Ná ɛyɛ abarimaa bi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
The man lied to his mother.	Ɔbarima no dii atoro kyerɛɛ ne maame.
But that doesn’t matter either.	Nanso ɛno nso nyɛ hwee.
Next year could be a different story.	Afe a edi hɔ no betumi ayɛ asɛm foforo.
The story started very well.	Asɛm no fii ase yiye paa.
This may sound a little weird, but it really works.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra, nanso ɛyɛ adwuma ankasa.
But other than that, it’s great.	Nanso sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I prefer to travel by bus.	Mepɛ sɛ mede bɔs tu kwan.
And it doesn’t matter, you know.	Na ɛho nhia, wunim.
Anyone can get involved.	Obiara betumi akɔ mu.
He didn't know how to control it.	Ná onnim sɛnea obetumi adi so.
The task is not easy.	Adwuma no nyɛ mmerɛw.
He told his son.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ba no.
It seemed like a lifetime ago.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nkwa nna nyinaa a atwam ni.
Mine isn’t the same.	Me de no nyɛ saa.
Which was his only pain.	Nea na ɛyɛ ne yaw nkutoo.
Nevertheless, there are exceptions.	Ne nyinaa mu no, nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛnyɛ saa.
Kids love this game.	Mmofra ani gye saa agoru yi ho.
At least a little bit.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ kakra.
He hurt her.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​yaw.
He loves his room and bed.	N’ani gye ne dan ne ne mpa ho.
But if anyone went with him, he didn’t know.	Nanso sɛ obi ne no kɔ a, na onnim.
You can’t see the house, you say.	Worentumi nhu ofie no, woka.
I wish there were windows.	Me yam a anka mfɛnsere wɔ hɔ.
It’s as simple as that.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ ɛno ara.
He didn't even have to act much.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔyɛ agoru pii mpo.
For their work.	Wɔ wɔn adwuma no ho.
The first group takes the lead.	Kuw a edi kan no na edi anim.
That is what happened today.	Ɛno ne nea esii nnɛ.
What is this? 	Dɛn ne eyi?
He was fascinated by her.	Ná n’ani gye ne ho.
a squirrel!	ɔkraman bi!
That was a big deal.	Na ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse.
He is loyal to his friends.	Odi nokware ma ne nnamfo.
That’s how they describe it.	Saa na wɔka ho asɛm.
Just look at it.	Hwɛ no ara kwa.
Everyone was totally involved.	Ná obiara de ne ho ahyɛ mu koraa.
It’s this movie.	Ɛyɛ sini yi.
But most people.	Nanso nnipa dodow no ara.
And no one really wants that.	Na obiara mpɛ saa ankasa.
He lives nearby.	Ɔte bɛn hɔ.
We can look forward to something positive.	Yebetumi ahwɛ biribi pa.
And it wasn’t pretty.	Na na ɛnyɛ fɛ.
Treat a man like a child.	Wo ne ɔbarima nni sɛ abofra.
It’s just really hard.	Ɛyɛ den ankasa kɛkɛ.
How good it is for you to be here.	Hwɛ sɛnea eye ma wo sɛ wowɔ ha.
The elderly man stared at the picture.	Ɔbarima a ne mfe akɔ anim no hwɛɛ mfonini no denneennen.
This can cause all sorts of problems.	Eyi betumi de ɔhaw ahorow nyinaa aba.
Take time to think your words through.	Gye bere susuw wo nsɛm ho yiye.
I need to talk to you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa.
It is such a situation.	Ɛyɛ tebea a ɛte saa.
We are in trouble here.	Yɛwɔ ɔhaw mu wɔ ha.
I know you better than that.	Minim wo yiye sen saa.
But the game was already one.	Nanso na agoru no ayɛ biako dedaw.
But there is still plenty of winter left.	Nanso awɔw bere pii da so ara aka.
I believe you can do it.	Migye di sɛ wubetumi ayɛ.
The water was brand new.	Ná nsu no yɛ foforo koraa.
It didn’t work for either of us.	Anyɛ adwuma amma yɛn mu biara.
Check it out here.	Hwɛ no wɔ ha.
It was cold enough right now.	Ná awɔw wom sɛnea ɛsɛ mprempren ara.
There is so little time in the day.	Bere kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ wɔ da no mu.
You were really good.	Ná woyɛ papa ankasa.
It was too crowded and difficult for her taste.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ mu ma dodo na na ɛyɛ den ma nea n’ani gye ho.
I go to work every day.	Mekɔ adwuma da biara.
if there is any.	sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ a.
I can’t talk about it anymore.	Mintumi nka ho asɛm bio.
It’s a real problem.	Ɛyɛ ɔhaw ankasa.
You can see it on the picture below.	Wubetumi ahu wɔ mfonini a ɛwɔ ase ha no so.
Every day, you have to condition yourself to succeed.	Da biara, ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wo ho tebea na ama asi wo yiye.
Not everyone has those things either.	Ɛnyɛ obiara nso na ɔwɔ saa nneɛma no.
But he thought it was beautiful.	Nanso na osusuw sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ.
Those days are over.	Saa nna no aba awiei.
In the past three years.	Wɔ mfe abiɛsa a atwam no mu.
You spend all your time thinking rather than acting.	Wode wo bere nyinaa susuw nneɛma ho sen sɛ wobɛyɛ ade.
Something else was going on here.	Ná biribi foforo rekɔ so wɔ ha.
It’s just what it is.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛte ara kwa.
Wasn’t it something like that.	So na ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
Don’t talk about me.	Mma wo nka me ho asɛm.
I played with it and loved it.	Mede dii agoru na m’ani gyee ho.
Maybe a week late.	Ebia na aka akyi dapɛn biako.
That will do for me.	Ɛno bɛyɛ ama me.
It is not a reference point.	Ɛnyɛ nea wɔde hwɛ biribi so.
Be very careful.	Hwɛ yiye paa.
He is working for someone else.	Ɔreyɛ adwuma ama obi foforo.
A long time ago.	Bere tenten a atwam ni.
But it was difficult.	Nanso na ɛyɛ den.
Many of us know.	Yɛn mu pii nim.
We need to do this every morning!.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ eyi anɔpa biara!.
His father again.	Ne papa bio.
Wrong, that time is long gone.	Mfomso, saa bere no atwam akyɛ.
And there was nothing.	Na biribiara nni hɔ.
It’s not an idea.	Ɛnyɛ adwene bi.
I have done well so far.	Mayɛ yiye de besi nnɛ.
There was really nothing else he could do.	Na biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ ankasa.
But he would say it anyway.	Nanso na ɔbɛka no ɔkwan biara so.
A story of sorts.	Asɛm bi a ɛyɛ ɔkwan bi so.
He was a big, strong man, quick.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse a ne ho yɛ den, na ɔyɛ ntɛm.
Maybe it’s too late.	Ebia na aka akyi.
It is not a wise thing to do.	Ɛnyɛ ade a nyansa wom sɛ wobɛyɛ.
That’s what one had to do.	Saa na na ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ.
So we’ve brought it back.	Enti yɛde aba bio.
You need to know everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu biribiara.
I can do projects alone or in a group.	Me nkutoo metumi ayɛ nnwuma anaa kuw bi mu.
Very easy to use.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
It should be stronger than it is.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den sen sɛnea ɛte.
I know something about it, but not enough.	Minim ho biribi, nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
But he’s not.	Nanso ɔno de.
I do the same thing.	Me nso meyɛ saa.
It was a terrible thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu.
He knew he had to do something.	Ná onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
In a way, it is.	Ɔkwan bi so no, ɛte saa.
Tell them everything.	Ka biribiara kyerɛ wɔn.
You have to think about all of that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw saa nneɛma no nyinaa ho.
I see how happy everyone is.	Mihu sɛnea obiara wɔ anigye no.
For a moment more they were themselves.	Bere tiaa bi bio na wɔyɛ wɔn ankasa.
I am a human being, and I am a human being.	Meyɛ onipa, na meyɛ onipa.
Not that you know everyone.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ wunim obiara.
The issue was complicated.	Ná asɛm no mu yɛ den.
But it wasn’t like that anymore.	Nanso na ɛnte saa bio.
Thank you so much for the idea.	Meda wo ase pii wɔ adwene no ho.
But this was no joke at all.	Nanso na eyi nyɛ agoru koraa.
At least he could enjoy that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na obetumi anya saa asɛm no mu anigye.
That’s what you can use.	Ɛno na wubetumi de adi dwuma.
Or on his gun.	Anaasɛ ne tuo no so.
The rest may take a little longer.	Ebia nea aka no begye bere tenten kakra.
At least this is questionable.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, eyi yɛ nea asɛm wɔ ho.
Back to the party.	San kɔ apontow no ase.
Usually not much.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ pii.
He shouldn’t be planning.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nhyehyɛe.
That doesn’t mean.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ.
I wasn't real to him.	Ná menyɛ obi ankasa mma no.
Certainly not one on one.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ biako wɔ biako so.
He had made up his mind.	Ná wayɛ n’adwene wɔ ne ho.
That thing is old and old.	Saa ade no akyɛ na ayɛ dedaw.
Not that it doesn’t anymore.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ bio.
This was too strong.	Ná eyi mu yɛ den dodo.
I didn't need to know more.	Ná enhia sɛ mihu pii sen saa.
They liked the current situation.	Wɔn ani gyee mprempren tebea no ho.
Maybe better than that.	Ebia eye sen saa.
Things that aren’t kids.	Nneɛma a ɛnyɛ mmofra no.
We have to put them in jail, we have to.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde wɔn to afiase, ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
You can get an idea of ​​what it looks like.	Wubetumi anya adwene bi wɔ sɛnea ɛte no ho.
I can’t see it now.	Mintumi nhu no mprempren.
This is his plan.	Eyi ne ne nhyehyɛe.
That makes it even better.	Ɛno ma ɛyɛ papa mpo.
But it’s not just any book.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nhoma biara kɛkɛ.
And that’s what it is.	Na ɛno ne saa.
But it is used under this condition.	Nanso wɔde di dwuma wɔ tebea yi ase.
Besides, we need to act now.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi mprempren.
That’s why he was on the road right now.	Ɛno nti na na ɔwɔ kwan so mprempren yi ara no.
Many people have opinions about him.	Nnipa pii wɔ ne ho adwene.
It works for me then.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ma me saa bere no.
I headed down them too.	Me nso mede m’ani kyerɛɛ wɔn fam.
He didn't want to help her.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔbɛboa no.
Think about that.	Susuw saa asɛm no ho hwɛ.
Feel like you used it.	Te nka sɛ wode dii dwuma.
But they were all still alive.	Nanso na wɔn nyinaa da so te ase.
In any case.	Wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
The car was gone.	Ná kar no nni hɔ bio.
But you will do that.	Nanso wobɛyɛ saa.
So that’s a really, really rare car.	Enti ɛno yɛ kar a ɛho yɛ na ankasa, ankasa.
No one else could see him.	Ná obi foforo biara nni hɔ a obetumi ahu no.
Could this be the problem.	So eyi betumi ayɛ ɔhaw no.
I have it right here.	Mewɔ no wɔ ha yi ara.
It’s hot out there.	Ɛyɛ hyew wɔ hɔ.
It looks very interesting.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
It’s been too long.	Ɛyɛ bere tenten dodo.
The door slammed shut.	Ɔpon no bɔɔ mu denneennen.
There was no food, either.	Ná aduan biara nni hɔ, nso.
He did the testing part.	Ɔyɛɛ sɔhwɛ fã no.
It was a happy time for everyone.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye bere ma obiara.
The truth is our money is fake.	Nokware no ne sɛ yɛn sika yɛ atoro.
After this article ends.	Bere a asɛm yi aba awiei akyi.
There is still much to be done.	Nneɛma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
There was something wrong with it somewhere.	Na bɔne bi wɔ ho wɔ baabi.
Does he owe you anything?	So ɔde wo ka bi?
The feedback is a necessarily wrong one.	Nsɛm a wɔde ma no yɛ mfomso a ɛyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
That book is amazing.	Saa nhoma no yɛ nwonwa.
The offense was enough for the team to succeed.	Mfomso no yɛɛ nea ɛdɔɔso maa kuw no dii yiye.
But even this can work to your advantage.	Nanso eyi mpo betumi ayɛ adwuma aboa wo.
Everyone wants a piece of it.	Obiara pɛ ne fã bi.
You have children.	Wowɔ mma.
Tell people what is going on.	Ka nea ɛrekɔ so no ho asɛm kyerɛ nkurɔfo.
Your support has meant everything.	Mo mmoa no akyerɛ biribiara.
However, here is another idea.	Nanso, adwene foforo ni.
I prefer her to him.	Mepɛ no sen ɔno.
Please look at me.	Mesrɛ wo hwɛ me.
That really made my day!.	Ɛno maa me da no yɛɛ adwuma ankasa!.
He handed her the letter.	Ɔde krataa no maa no.
Which is just the best.	Nea ɛyɛ papa ara kwa.
We were .	Ná yɛyɛ .
And it was free!.	Na ɛyɛ kwa!.
Give me one more chance to speed up that day.	Ma me hokwan biako bio na ama saa da no aba ntɛmntɛm.
I had nothing else.	Ná minni biribi foforo biara.
That’s how it should be.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
There is no problem.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
I don’t like these songs.	M’ani nnye nnwom yi ho.
But you’ll enjoy it anyway.	Nanso w’ani begye ho ɔkwan biara so.
The end has come.	Awiei no aba.
But there was no time to deal with their new situation.	Nanso na bere biara nni hɔ a wɔde bedi wɔn tebea foforo no ho dwuma.
You have to tell me what is going on here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha kyerɛ me.
We need to do something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ biribi.
Maybe he should do that.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
That’s a really big deal for them.	Ɛno yɛ ade kɛse ankasa ma wɔn.
All of these things can be true at the same time.	Saa nneɛma yi nyinaa betumi ayɛ nokware bere koro mu.
I want to go to the gym.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ.
I didn’t even know you were here.	Na minnim mpo sɛ wowɔ ha.
We have enough of that.	Yɛwɔ saa nneɛma no a ɛdɔɔso.
It’s just enough.	Ɛdɔɔso ara kwa.
It doesn’t hurt.	Ɛnyɛ yaw.
This must be the reason.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
This was beautiful.	Ná eyi yɛ fɛ.
He is alive now.	Ɔte ase mprempren.
Do a little action here and there.	Yɛ ade kakra wɔ ha ne ha.
You need to make a plan.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
All he wanted was to like it.	Nea na ɔpɛ ara ne sɛ n’ani gye ho.
Not every time.	Ɛnyɛ bere biara.
Out there in the void.	Wɔ abɔnten hɔ baabi a hwee nni hɔ.
Everyone wants to play.	Obiara pɛ sɛ odi agoru.
That’s his character.	Ɛno ne ne su.
I want to keep looking into it.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so hwɛ mu.
I'm not sure what this will accomplish though.	Me nnim nea eyi bɛma ayɛ yiye de, nanso.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
If he was doing that.	Sɛ na ɔyɛ saa a.
You just don’t matter anymore.	Wo ho nhia bio kɛkɛ.
Or it couldn’t say.	Anaasɛ antumi anka.
And he will do so.	Na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
People need to feel it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo te nka.
You really need to know that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu saa ampa.
He was as innocent as a child.	Ná ne ho nni asɛm te sɛ abofra.
Mom didn’t have to worry that much.	Ná enhia sɛ Maame haw ne ho saa.
His children were drowned.	Ne mma no nsu faa wɔn.
This is a little closer to home.	Eyi bɛn fie kakra.
What happened next shocked me.	Nea esii akyi no maa me ho dwiriw me.
This trend is nothing new for the music industry.	Saa su yi nyɛ ade foforo mma nnwom adwuma no.
This time, it seemed innocuous.	Saa bere yi de, na ɛte sɛ nea asɛm biara nni ho.
They are strong.	Wɔyɛ den.
Too many people.	Nnipa pii dodo.
One way is to add more features to the product.	Ɔkwan biako ne sɛ wɔde nneɛma pii bɛka ade no ho.
No one, as far as he knew.	Obiara nni hɔ, sɛnea na onim no.
I see them.	Mihu wɔn.
I can't seem to figure out why it doesn't work.	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nhu nea enti a ɛnyɛ adwuma no.
That’s why people love it.	Ɛno nti na nkurɔfo ani gye ho no.
No one knows what you want but you.	Obiara nnim nea wopɛ gye wo nkutoo.
It was also true.	Ná ɛyɛ nokware nso.
Mom works long hours now.	Maame yɛ adwuma nnɔnhwerew pii mprempren.
He told them he had a meeting.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ wɔn sɛ na ɔwɔ nhyiam bi.
I was interested in doing that.	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
I'm keeping my eye on things here.	Mede m’ani asi nneɛma so wɔ ha.
Save so many people.	Gye nnipa pii saa.
Can we all just get better?	So yɛn nyinaa betumi ayɛ yiye ara kwa?
I was completely alone.	Ná me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ koraa.
Everything else is still here.	Biribiara a aka no da so ara wɔ ha.
And it wasn’t at all.	Na na ɛnte saa koraa.
The water is warm today.	Nsu no yɛ hyew nnɛ.
It’s not the same thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade koro no ara.
You can’t do that.	Worentumi nyɛ saa.
He was deeply disturbed by the incident.	Asɛm a esii no haw no kɛse.
The most popular these days.	Nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse nnansa yi.
And that takes a while.	Na ɛno gye bere kakra.
I have forgiven him.	Mede akyɛ no.
This makes this test more difficult than the previous one.	Eyi ma sɔhwɛ yi mu yɛ den sen nea atwam no.
None of them would be like that.	Anka wɔn mu biara nni hɔ a ɔte saa.
In our opinion, these issues are really important.	Yɛn adwene mu no, saa nsɛm yi ho hia ankasa.
I’m not doing anything.	Menyɛ hwee.
I just want sleep.	Mepɛ nna ara kwa.
At least no one should be able to do that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara tumi yɛ saa.
Why don’t you like him so much?	Dɛn nti na w’ani nnye ne ho saa?
But he knew what he could do.	Nanso na onim nea obetumi ayɛ.
We are very strong.	Yɛyɛ den paa.
He wanted the night.	Ná ɔpɛ anadwo no.
Think about the subject you want to cover.	Susuw asɛm a wopɛ sɛ woka ho asɛm no ho.
How long will this take?	Bere tenten ahe na eyi begye?
We’re glad you’re here!.	Yɛn ani agye sɛ wowɔ ha!.
I really didn’t know what to think.	Ankasa na minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
The car looked good.	Ná kar no hwɛ yiye.
I was only there for one night.	Ná mewɔ hɔ anadwo biako pɛ.
There was something in his eyes.	Ná biribi wɔ n’ani so.
But live it every day.	Nanso fa tra ase da biara da.
It was a busy day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a adagyew nnim.
Even if the problem is .	Sɛ mpo ɔhaw no yɛ .
Or at least give my kid a chance to make one.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ma me ba no nnya hokwan nyɛ biako.
Nothing seems to be going his way.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara nkɔ ne kwan so.
Inside, there is the reason.	Wɔ mu no, nea enti a ɛte saa no wɔ hɔ.
That had to be good.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ papa.
It’s easy and good.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw na eye.
Share your comments with us.	Fa wo nsɛm no kyerɛ yɛn.
He was a beautiful man.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He never knew.	Ná onnim da.
It looks very strange.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
I'm not sure what this means.	Me ntumi nhu nea eyi kyerɛ.
But this is a very dangerous time.	Nanso eyi yɛ bere a asiane kɛse wom.
Take advantage of that time.	Fa saa bere no di dwuma.
You should do the same.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ saa.
That sounds good.	Ɛno te sɛ nea eye.
It’s one book.	Ɛyɛ nhoma biako.
That meant a lot to me.	Ná ɛno kyerɛ pii ma me.
It still doesn’t let me.	Ɛda so ara mma me kwan.
If I am to do that, it has to be bad.	Sɛ mɛyɛ saa a, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne.
He hoped not.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnte saa.
Tonight in bed.	Anadwo yi wɔ mpa so.
But he had already forgotten about it.	Nanso na ne werɛ afi ho dedaw.
It’s never been my favorite thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade a m’ani gye ho kɛse da.
It's been a while.	Bere tiaa bi ni.
He had to touch her mind.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka n’adwene.
We drove down the road.	Yɛde kar faa kwan no so.
Maybe even for the first time.	Ebia na ɛyɛ nea edi kan mpo.
It’s not an inside job.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛwɔ mu.
He had done it.	Ná wayɛ no.
It wasn’t like him.	Na ɛnte sɛ ɔno.
This is the point.	Eyi ne asɛm no.
My head is pounding!	Me ti rebɔ!
It is good for some things.	Ɛyɛ papa wɔ nneɛma bi ho.
It should not be worn every day.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde hyɛ da biara da.
The end of the year.	Afe no awiei.
If no one sees him.	Sɛ obiara nhu no a.
Know how much you have and how much you owe.	Hu sika dodow a wowɔ ne sika dodow a wode ka.
I put him on the floor.	Mede no too fam.
He doesn’t want children.	Ɔmpɛ mmofra.
I want to believe that it is.	Mepɛ sɛ migye di sɛ ɛte saa.
Or it doesn’t.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
He was at home.	Ná ɔwɔ fie.
He just knew it was there.	Ná onim ara kwa sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
It’s a very simple test, a very good test.	Ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye, sɔhwɛ a eye yiye.
This is the big moment.	Eyi ne bere kɛse no.
This is my favorite time of day.	Eyi ne bere a m’ani gye ho paa wɔ da no mu.
There is no cost to you.	Ɛho ka biara nni hɔ mma wo.
So much more.	Enti pii bio.
However, the story does not end there.	Nanso, asɛm no nkɔ awiei wɔ hɔ.
Never hear the back story.	Mma nte asɛm no akyi da.
But it’s still interesting.	Nanso ɛda so ara yɛ anigye.
And it was beautiful, too.	Na na ɛyɛ fɛ nso.
He thought he would recover sometime.	Ná osusuw sɛ ne ho bɛtɔ no bere bi.
These meetings have been going on for years.	Nhyiam ahorow yi akɔ so mfe pii ni.
That was their plan.	Ná ɛno ne wɔn nhyehyɛe.
I need to see your eyes.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu w’ani.
It’s by our front door.	Ɛwɔ yɛn anim pon ho.
Many of his people share his views.	Ne nkurɔfo pii ne n’adwene yɛ adwene.
But that is a human matter.	Nanso ɛno yɛ nnipa asɛm.
You really need to know how things work out.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu sɛnea nneɛma kɔ so yiye ankasa.
It has worked for me.	Ayɛ adwuma ama me.
At least not for humans.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nnipa de.
I really don't know why.	Ankasa minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
No one knew that.	Ná obiara nnim saa.
Someone like.	Obi te sɛ.
No police officers.	Polisifo biara mma.
It should be an exciting time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ anigye.
However, they are usually expensive.	Nanso, mpɛn pii no, wɔn bo yɛ den.
He should have been faster.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
At that time.	Saa bere no.
The legs were still there.	Ná nan no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
It’s kind of fun to have them in it.	Ɛyɛ anigye bi sɛ wowɔ wɔn wɔ mu.
I absolutely love this picture.	M’ani gye mfonini yi ho koraa.
It’s his car.	Ɛyɛ ne kar.
Which we have below.	Nea yɛwɔ wɔ ase ha.
Take a better shot.	Fa tuo a eye sen saa.
However, this is not true.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ nokware.
That was a mistake.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfomso.
Thus, quantity is paramount to success.	Enti, dodow ho hia sen biara na ama asi yiye.
Sorry if it's kind of long.	Pa kyɛw sɛ ɛyɛ tenten bi a.
Everyone had a wonderful time.	Obiara nyaa bere a ɛyɛ anigye.
Like, really take their time.	Te sɛ, gye wɔn bere ankasa.
Where it never was.	Baabi a na ɛnte saa da.
Something else went wrong.	Biribi foforo nso ankɔ yiye.
These shoes have a comfortable sole.	Saa mpaboa yi wɔ nan ase a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Obviously, it’s not easy and you have to put in the work.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ mmerɛw na ɛsɛ sɛ wode hyɛ adwuma no mu.
But he was here now.	Nanso na ɔwɔ ha mprempren.
There was no food in the house.	Ná aduan biara nni fie hɔ.
There is no problem.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
He thought about it, too.	Ɔno nso susuw ho.
Time was up for him.	Ná bere aba awiei ama no.
And it was amazing.	Na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It was still there, just a short drive away.	Ná ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ, na na ɛyɛ kar kwan tiaa bi pɛ.
That’s not even new.	Ɛno nyɛ ade foforo mpo.
You’re a child.	Woyɛ abofra.
He didn't care what anyone thought of him.	Ná nea obi susuw wɔ ne ho no mfa ne ho.
It’s what that system can be intimidating about you.	Ɛyɛ nea saa nhyehyɛe no betumi ayɛ wo ho suro.
I just didn't know what to do.	Ná minnim nea menyɛ ara kwa.
It wasn’t like that.	Ná ɛnte saa.
I'll be here tomorrow.	Mewɔ ha ɔkyena.
Something wrong.	Biribi bɔne.
It’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
This is where it all goes wrong.	Eyi ne baabi a ne nyinaa kɔ so bɔne.
Try to apply the features of these articles.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wode nneɛma a ɛwɔ saa nsɛm yi mu no bedi dwuma.
You don’t seem too happy with yours.	Wo te sɛ nea w’ani nnye wo de no ho kɛse.
It’s soft and smooth.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
But if.	Nanso sɛ.
The police acted quickly.	Polisifo no yɛɛ ade ntɛmntɛm.
I can just be happy.	Metumi anya anigye ara kwa.
He never wanted this season to end.	Na ɔmpɛ sɛ saa bere yi bɛba awiei da.
Making dinner will be fun.	Anwummere aduan a wobɛyɛ no bɛyɛ anigye.
And to be honest, that’s what works for me.	Na sɛ mɛka nokware a, ɛno ne nea ɛyɛ adwuma ma me.
There is money here.	Sika wɔ ha.
There were many reasons why he should not.	Ná nneɛma pii nti na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
My mom really stuck with it too.	Me maame nso de ne ho bɔɔ ne ho ankasa.
Give it to me now.	Fa no ma me mprempren.
School was going on all day.	Ná sukuu no rekɔ so da mũ no nyinaa.
Not everyone will appreciate what you do for them.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na n’ani begye nea woyɛ ma wɔn no ho.
Most of my lessons are still relevant today.	Me adesua dodow no ara da so ara fa me ho nnɛ.
But no one could do it right either.	Nanso obiara antumi anyɛ no yiye nso.
I have a picture of it.	Mewɔ ne mfonini.
I can't figure out the thing.	Mintumi nsusuw ade no ho.
I saw the worst people.	Mihuu nnipa a wɔyɛ bɔne sen biara.
Now you know where you are.	Seesei wunim baabi a wowɔ.
This was a surprise.	Ná eyi yɛ nwonwa.
They both nodded.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa de wɔn ti too fam.
Can you tell us about the past?	So wubetumi aka nneɛma a atwam ho asɛm akyerɛ yɛn?
He had worked on it a long, long time ago.	Na wayɛ ho adwuma bere tenten, bere tenten a atwam ni.
This gives him a better understanding of the issue.	Eyi ma ɔte asɛm no ase yiye.
There was sex stuff and there was money stuff.	Na nna ho nneɛma wɔ hɔ na na sika ho nneɛma nso wɔ hɔ.
I did the same thing.	Meyɛɛ saa ara.
People can’t even figure out what they are.	Nkurɔfo ntumi nhu nea wɔyɛ mpo.
Never leave the house.	Mma mfi fie hɔ da.
There is no idea.	Adwene biara nni hɔ.
I put in my information.	Mede me ho nsɛm hyɛɛ mu.
Below is an amazing sight.	Ase hɔ no yɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa a wubetumi ahu.
The music got louder.	Nnwom no yɛɛ den kɛse.
He showed them his car.	Ɔde ne kar kyerɛɛ wɔn.
It was a game for him.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru ma no.
That’s how amazing it is.	Saa na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
They spent hours on the road.	Wɔde nnɔnhwerew pii traa kwan so.
I had no control over myself at the time.	Saa bere no na minni me ho so tumi biara.
There is nothing wrong with this work.	Mfomso biara nni adwuma yi mu.
Whatever you want.	Nea wopɛ biara.
Happiness is not so happy.	Anigye nyɛ anigye saa.
The problem is.	Ɔhaw no.
Put me through all this trouble for nothing.	Fa me to saa ɔhaw yi nyinaa mu kwa.
Every part of it, down to the last.	Ne fã biara, kosi nea etwa to no so.
I am not surprised by it.	Ɛnyɛ me nwonwa wɔ ho.
Everything is going well.	Biribiara rekɔ so yiye.
I understand that it is important.	Mete ase sɛ ɛho hia.
They tell their story as a group.	Wɔka wɔn asɛm no sɛ kuw.
Almost all of us.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa.
I think you will do that.	Misusuw sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
He spent the winter indoors.	Ɔde awɔw bere no nyinaa traa dan mu.
First, they had to go through the first week on their own.	Nea edi kan no, na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn ankasa fa dapɛn a edi kan no mu.
But only if you want it to be that way, of course.	Nanso sɛ wopɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa nkutoo a, ɛyɛ nokware.
If anyone can help me.	Sɛ obi betumi aboa me a.
I’m really enjoying it.   	M’ani gyee ho paa.   
mother.	maame.
It’s very inconvenient.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛnyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
I would have done the same.	Anka mɛyɛ saa ara.
I can’t imagine you’d be comfortable here.	Mintumi nsusuw sɛ wo ho bɛtɔ wo wɔ ha.
Your home is probably the most expensive thing you may own.	Ebia wo fie ne ade a ne bo yɛ den sen biara a ebia wowɔ.
There was only the past.	Ná nea atwam nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I had it, and it had me.	Ná mewɔ bi, na ɛno nso na ɛwɔ me.
But this must be done in a positive way.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi wɔ ɔkwan pa so.
But think carefully first.	Nanso di kan susuw ho yiye.
During the weekend.	Wɔ dapɛn awiei no mu.
So telephone users can use it.	Enti wɔn a wɔde telefon di dwuma no betumi de adi dwuma.
Of course, money is not language.	Ampa, sika nyɛ kasa.
You have made me human.	Wode me ayɛ onipa.
And here is the most exciting thing.	Na ade a ɛyɛ anigye sen biara ni.
Is that still going on today.	So ɛno da so ara kɔ so nnɛ.
It didn’t matter that she was his mother.	Ná ɛnyɛ hwee sɛ ɔyɛ ne maame.
I was very strong.	Ná me ho yɛ den yiye.
I hope it works for you!.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma ama wo!.
But never anything else.	Nanso biribi foforo biara nni hɔ da.
He was at the scene of the accident.	Ná ɔwɔ baabi a akwanhyia no sii no.
It’s all going on.	Ne nyinaa rekɔ so.
Some wisdom is needed.	Nyansa bi ho hia.
At least for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ma me.
There has to be someone else.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi foforo wɔ hɔ.
Where our story begins.	Baabi a yɛn asɛm no fi ase.
I knew you were doing one.	Ná minim sɛ woreyɛ biako.
Everything will be fine.	Biribiara bɛkɔ yiye.
There is nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
That is not true either.	Ɛno nso nyɛ nokware.
However, it is what it is.	Nanso, ɛyɛ nea ɛte.
I don’t really know what that means.	Minnim nea ɛno kyerɛ ankasa.
In every city.	Kurow biara mu.
But he was at home.	Nanso na ɔwɔ fie.
The most important thing is quality.	Ade a ɛho hia sen biara ne su pa.
But none of these things are possible.	Nanso saa nneɛma yi mu biara ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Leather clothes were a luxury.	Ná ntade a wɔde aboa nhoma ayɛ yɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
And eventually those kids leave.	Na awiei koraa no, saa mmofra no fi hɔ kɔ.
Do this for a week.	Yɛ eyi dapɛn biako.
However, this statement is not true.	Nanso, saa asɛm yi nyɛ nokware.
The city was shocked.	Kurow no ho dwiriw no.
He liked her, he knew it.	Ná n’ani gye ne ho, na onim saa.
This may or may not happen simultaneously.	Eyi betumi asi bere koro mu anaasɛ ɛnyɛ bere koro mu.
If anyone could save him, it would be him.	Sɛ obi betumi agye no nkwa a, ɛbɛyɛ ɔno.
So, it was a bit cold.	Enti, na awɔw wom kakra.
It’s a very dramatic and powerful image.	Ɛyɛ mfonini a ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye na ɛwɔ tumi.
Maybe it was the case.	Ebia na ɛte saa.
So that’s a big problem.	Enti ɛno yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
If you want to, follow it.	Sɛ wopɛ a, di akyi.
What year is it now?	Afe bɛn na ɛyɛ mprempren?
It’s not that either.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno nso.
In other words, it’s not just one thing.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛnyɛ ade biako pɛ.
I'm right here.	Mewɔ ha yi ara.
Tell me the real reason.	Ka nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa kyerɛ me.
This was not real.	Ná eyi nyɛ ade ankasa.
Two of them are included.	Wɔn mu baanu ka ho.
Every house had books.	Ná nhoma wɔ ofie biara mu.
Things are busy.	Nneɛma nni adagyew.
People are animals.	Nkurɔfo yɛ mmoa.
I must have put that card in, too.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mede saa krataa no hyɛɛ mu, nso.
It was the most beautiful house.	Ná ɛyɛ ofie a ɛyɛ fɛ sen biara.
They are stronger than ever.	Wɔyɛ den sen bere biara.
You have a job to do.	Wowɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
It will be great.	Ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
The people come.	Nkurɔfo no ba.
I'm with me and I'm with me.	Me ne me ne me ne me.
There are three types here.	Ahorow abiɛsa wɔ ha.
But maybe it’s something else.	Nanso ebia ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
Unless they are immediately happy.	Gye sɛ wɔn ani gye ntɛm ara.
He is in a simple way.	Ɔwɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw so.
I'll talk to you about it later.	Me ne wo bɛka ho asɛm akyiri yi.
Every story meant a lot to him.	Ná asɛm biara kyerɛ pii ma no.
I barely ate anything the whole day.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na minni hwee da mũ no nyinaa.
He had never done that before.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa da.
Being ‘in control’ of my day.	Sɛ́ mɛyɛ ‘ahyɛ’ me da no so.
The story would have been minimal, a simple road movie.	Anka asɛm no bɛyɛ kakraa bi, ɔkwan so sini a ɛnyɛ den.
They shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
That seems to add another layer of complexity.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno de nneɛma foforo a ɛyɛ den ka ho.
In the food.	Wɔ aduan no mu.
Except it wasn’t any old person.	Gye sɛ na ɛnyɛ obi dedaw biara.
I was strong enough.	Ná me ho yɛ den.
He was not beautiful.	Ná ne ho nyɛ fɛ.
I took them to school every day.	Ná mede wɔn kɔ sukuu da biara.
It’s too dangerous.	Ɛyɛ asiane kɛse dodo.
They may once have been animals.	Ebia bere bi na wɔyɛ mmoa.
And that’s all they sign up for.	Na ɛno nkutoo na wɔde wɔn nsa hyɛ ase.
We made money with it.	Yɛde so nyaa sika.
Everything just happened too fast.	Biribiara sii ntɛmntɛm dodo ara kwa.
That car is going fast.	Saa kar no rekɔ ntɛmntɛm.
It seemed easy to him.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea na ɛnyɛ den mma no.
Maybe next time!.	Ebia bere foforo!.
I need to hear this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete eyi.
If that’s what you want.	Sɛ ɛno ne nea wopɛ a.
He is tall.	Ɔyɛ tenten.
I’m glad you enjoyed the book.	Ɛyɛ me anigye sɛ w’ani gyee nhoma no ho.
The same is true	Saa ara na ɛte saa ara .
I want to keep doing that.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ saa.
You can tell me about it.	Wubetumi aka akyerɛ me.
I felt so bad about it.	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne kɛse.
It may seem strange.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This has been a problem for years.	Eyi ayɛ ɔhaw mfe pii ni.
It’s a simple one.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Or the food.	Anaasɛ aduan no.
There has to be a better way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ.
He knows that face well.	Onim saa anim no yiye.
At least it is us.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ yɛn.
This is before you do that.	Eyi yɛ ansa na woreyɛ saa.
It is true now.	Ɛyɛ nokware mprempren.
About a book, story, or person.	Nhoma, asɛm, anaa onipa bi ho asɛm.
It’s cold outside.	Awɔw wɔ abɔnten.
However, you are not an equal.	Nanso, wonyɛ obi a wopɛ sɛ wo ne no yɛ pɛ.
Give us a better chance.	Ma yɛn hokwan a eye sen saa.
The same thing was true.	Saa ara na na ɛte.
A picture last week.	Mfonini bi dapɛn a etwaam no.
Every week it gets better.	Dapɛn biara ɛyɛ yiye.
What a terrible thing!	Ade a ɛyɛ hu bɛn ara ni!
It was just one of many.	Ná ɛyɛ pii no mu biako pɛ.
I think they do, but maybe not for everyone.	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ saa, nanso ebia ɛnyɛ obiara de.
But it was always there.	Nanso na ɛwɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
The risk of use lies entirely with the user.	Asiane a ɛwɔ sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma mu no da nea ɔde di dwuma no so koraa.
It’s not like that for anyone.	Ɛnte saa mma obiara.
It is not an easy task.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
He had made a commitment himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa ahyɛ ne ho bɔ.
There is no one.	Obiara nni hɔ.
He used humans.	Ɔde nnipa dii dwuma.
No one ever needs to sign anything.	Ɛho nhia sɛ obiara de ne nsa hyɛ biribi ase da.
But no one really knows how big it is.	Nanso obiara nnim sɛnea ɛyɛ kɛse ankasa.
Everyone has a past.	Obiara wɔ nea atwam.
It will be popular.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
And you only want one.	Na wopɛ biako pɛ.
The quality of this food is awesome.	Sɛnea aduan yi te no yɛ hu.
This same guy.	Saa ɔbarima yi ara.
I can see your mother in your eyes.	Metumi ahu wo maame wɔ w’ani so.
It’s a huge problem.	Ɛyɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
I would even say we are happy.	Anka mɛka mpo sɛ yɛn ani agye.
She was young and beautiful.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra na na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
There is no shortage of infrastructure.	Nneɛma a wɔde yɛ adwuma a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho nhia.
Here is a good picture of the two.	Nnipa baanu no ho mfonini pa wɔ ha.
He was told not to treat people that way.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔne nkurɔfo di saa.
Many different things.	Nneɛma ahorow pii.
They are a part of me.	Wɔyɛ me fã bi.
That, to me, is very important.	Ɛno, wɔ me fam no, ɛho hia kɛse.
This is how you should do it.	Eyi ne sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I headed off in another direction.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ baabi foforo.
It shouldn’t surprise us that it’s difficult.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn nwonwa sɛ ɛyɛ den.
So you never know.	Enti wunnim da.
You always knew he was there for the team.	Ná wunim bere nyinaa sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ ma kuw no.
I had no one to go with.	Ná minni obi a me ne no bɛkɔ.
Everyone is so real with him.	Obiara ne no ankasa saa.
I am good at this.	Me ho akokwaw wɔ eyi mu.
But tell me about yourself.	Nanso ka wo ho asɛm kyerɛ me.
Which, we do.	Nea, yɛyɛ.
This was not to be done.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi.
Make it easier for them, don’t you know.	Ma ɛnyɛ mmerɛw mma wɔn, wunnim.
I can’t figure out what was in it.	Mintumi nhu nea na ɛwɔ mu.
I could get used to this.	Ná metumi ayɛ eyi ho su.
But something to think about, something to remember .	Nanso biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho, biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wokae .
I want you to see him.	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu no.
And in order to do so.	Na sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛbɛyɛ saa.
The street is empty.	Abɔnten so yɛ baabi a obiara nni hɔ.
Work less and play more.	Yɛ adwuma kakraa bi na di agoru pii.
It’s not the case.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte.
That’s not so bad.	Ɛno nyɛ bɔne saa.
He wasn't normal, and that didn't matter.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a ɔte ase, na na ɛno nyɛ hwee.
And there are many more.	Na pii nso wɔ hɔ.
It’s not scary.	Ɛnyɛ hu.
He obviously has the game.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔwɔ agoru no.
Thank you so much for this lesson.	Meda mo ase pii wɔ adesua yi ho.
His plan did not work out as he had hoped.	Ne nhyehyɛe no ankɔ yiye sɛnea na ɔpɛ no.
But in this case it’s really hard.	Nanso wɔ eyi mu no ɛyɛ den ankasa.
For the next film.	Wɔ sini a edi hɔ no ho.
He could lie.	Ná obetumi adi atoro.
Not that we do that.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
It was just a matter of time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere ho asɛm ara kwa.
Again, very simple things.	Bio nso, nneɛma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
Both were successful.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa dii yiye.
He pointed to her.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ no ​​so.
The dog was a kitten.	Ná ɔkraman no yɛ ɔkraman ba.
I've had a good time with them.	Me ne wɔn abɔ bere pa.
But put your fears aside.	Nanso fa wo suro to nkyɛn.
What we do as an industry really matters.	Nea yɛyɛ sɛ nnwuma no ho hia ankasa.
This is what.	Eyi ne nea.
It’s not expensive.	Ɛnyɛ nea ne bo yɛ den.
Or a lot of water.	Anaasɛ nsu pii.
It must be pretty nice.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He has things that he pretends to be.	Ɔwɔ nneɛma a ɛyɛ ne ho sɛ ɔyɛ.
It’s really easy.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
Below are some pictures for your reference.	Mfonini ahorow bi wɔ ase hɔ a wubetumi ahwɛ so.
Everything is important.	Ade biara ho hia.
A terribly strong quality.	Su a ɛyɛ den a ɛyɛ hu.
That’s one of my favorite things to say.	Ɛno ne nneɛma a m’ani gye ho kɛse sɛ mɛka no mu biako.
It wasn’t going to happen.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
We enjoyed our stay.	Yɛn ani gyee yɛn tra no ho.
He must be	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ .
I don’t quite know how we would do it, but it’s there.	Minnim sɛnea anka yɛbɛyɛ no koraa, nanso ɛwɔ hɔ.
You don’t have to, you know.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa, wunim.
I had carried it with me ever since.	Ná mede akɔ me nkyɛn fi saa bere no.
His children knew.	Ná ne mma nim.
Not great but it works well for me.	Ɛnyɛ kɛse nanso ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ma me.
I don’t think most people know.	Minsusuw sɛ nnipa dodow no ara nim.
But not for any species.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mmoa ahorow biara de.
I have the time.	Mewɔ bere no.
I couldn't do anything for him.	Na mintumi nyɛ ade mma no.
It was a pleasure.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye.
Work is busy here.	Adwuma nni adagyew wɔ ha.
But that too is for another day.	Nanso ɛno nso yɛ da foforo de.
He is the one who speaks my words.	Ɔno na ɔka me nsɛm.
I really want this more than anything.	Mepɛ eyi ankasa sen biribiara.
Often even consider doing it alone.	Mpɛn pii no mpo susuw ho sɛ wobɛyɛ no nkutoo.
Run for your hat.	Tu mmirika fa wo kyɛw no.
He wasn’t lying.	Ná ɔnyɛ atoro.
Same old story.	Asɛm dedaw koro no ara.
But for me, the movie is great.	Nanso me fam no, sini no yɛ fɛ yiye.
He knew them personally.	Ná onim wɔn ankasa.
I have no problem talking about it.	Minni ɔhaw biara sɛ mɛka ho asɛm.
They cause trouble.	Wɔde ɔhaw ba.
And there will be more, no doubt.	Na pii nso bɛba, akyinnye biara nni ho.
The sooner you do this the better.	Dodow a woyɛ eyi ntɛmntɛm no, dodow no ara na eye.
They have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
My car doesn't work properly.	Me kar no ntumi nyɛ adwuma yiye.
This highway is a motorway.	Saa ɔkwan kɛse yi yɛ kar kwan.
So think about it carefully.	Enti susuw ho yiye.
No system is perfect.	Nhyehyɛe biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ pɛ.
He always said what he planned to say.	Ná ɔka nea wayɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ ɔbɛka no bere nyinaa.
That didn’t matter to me.	Ná ɛno mfa me ho.
We are a strong team, we are united.	Yɛyɛ kuw a ɛyɛ den, yɛyɛ biako.
That car is brand new.	Saa kar no yɛ foforo koraa.
It seems to have worked.	Ɛte sɛ nea ayɛ adwuma.
Again, not happy about it though.	Bio nso, ɛnyɛ anigye wɔ ho nanso.
I don’t care about the job.	Adwuma no ho nhia me.
But the book is hard.	Nanso nhoma no yɛ den.
I don’t want to have sex with you.	Mempɛ sɛ me ne wo da.
But that wasn’t all there was.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
He leaned against the window.	Ɔde ne ho bɔɔ mfɛnsere no mu.
You are not your father’s son.	Wonyɛ wo papa ba.
At least it seems that way.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
I don’t know of anything like that.	Minnim biribi a ɛte saa.
They spend time literally sitting in front of each other saying things and stuff.	Wɔde bere tra wɔn ho wɔn ho anim ankasa ka nsɛm ne nneɛma.
It was his first song.	Ná ɛyɛ ne nnwom a edi kan.
If so, it would be awesome.	Sɛ ɛte saa a, anka ɛbɛyɛ hu.
This dress is very complicated.	Saa atade yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ den yiye.
But they cannot forget.	Nanso wɔn werɛ ntumi mfi.
They really did.	Ná wɔyɛ saa ankasa.
He’s just the bad guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima bɔne no ara kwa.
It didn’t seem to matter much anymore.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia kɛse bio.
Wear whatever you want.	Hyɛ biribiara a wopɛ.
I think you’ll really enjoy it.	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ho ankasa.
He did the tests.	Ɔyɛɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow no.
Someone else came in too.	Obi foforo nso baa mu.
It’s the first day of the month.	Ɛyɛ ɔsram no mu da a edi kan.
We need to put it in place.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde hyɛ mu.
There was plenty of room for me, though.	Nanso, na baabi a ɛdɔɔso wɔ hɔ ma me.
I love the game.	M’ani gye agoru no ho.
There are so many things you can do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
It’s not the way it is.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛte no.
The user can enter whatever they want.	Nea ɔde di dwuma no betumi de biribiara a ɔpɛ ahyɛ mu.
In other words, it doesn’t work out at all.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛnyɛ yiye koraa.
This isn’t very good, but it’s good.	Eyi nyɛ papa koraa, nanso eye.
Definitely something amazing going on.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛrekɔ so.
He was in pain.	Ná ɔte yaw.
I would tell him something.	Ná mɛka biribi akyerɛ no.
And it was quite simple.	Na ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
Now he does that.	Seesei ɔyɛ saa.
I think it was on the doorstep of his house.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛwɔ ne fie pon ano.
Eventually, though, he nodded.	Nanso, awiei koraa no, ɔde ne ti too fam.
The old house was amazing.	Ná ofie dedaw no yɛ nwonwa.
They both knew this, and there is no need to elaborate.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa nim eyi, na ɛho nhia sɛ wɔka ho asɛm kɔ akyiri.
But at least he knows the problem.	Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no, onim ɔhaw no.
Thank you for this program it is really good.	Meda mo ase wɔ saa nhyehyɛe yi ho ɛyɛ papa ankasa.
I understand, no problem.	Mete ase, ɔhaw biara nni ho.
The first and only one.	Nea edi kan ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ nkutoo.
The next thing the phone rings.	Ade a edi hɔ a telefon no bɔ.
And he forgot about her.	Na ɔno nso werɛ fii no.
We all already know this.	Yɛn nyinaa nim eyi dedaw.
All night long, really.	Anadwo mũ no nyinaa, ampa.
He had a house there.	Ná ɔwɔ ofie wɔ hɔ.
He obviously didn’t have much else to do.	Ɛda adi sɛ na onni nneɛma foforo pii a ɔbɛyɛ.
Our clothes are wet.	Yɛn ntade yɛ nsu.
After that, we warmed up.	Ɛno akyi no, yɛn ho yɛɛ yɛn hyew.
The story is true.	Asɛm no yɛ nokware.
His is just a solid picture.	Ne de no yɛ mfonini a ɛyɛ den ara kwa.
But something bothers him.	Nanso biribi haw no.
I say, not at all.	Meka sɛ, ɛnyɛ koraa.
There was no other child for me to deal with.	Ná abofra foforo biara nni hɔ a me ne no bedi ho dwuma.
For us, it has definitely been the latter.	Yɛn fam no, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ayɛ nea etwa to no.
I felt cheap to use it.	Metee nka sɛ me bo nyɛ den na mede adi dwuma.
I find myself doing that a lot.	Mihu sɛ mereyɛ saa pii.
Cars kept approaching.	Kar ahorow kɔɔ so bɛn hɔ.
I feel faster.	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ ntɛm.
And so does he.	Na saa ara na ɔyɛ.
Not on this one.	Ɛnyɛ eyi so.
I had to be good.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ papa.
I feel strongly that he knows this.	Mete nka denneennen sɛ onim eyi.
He is a two-person.	Ɔyɛ nnipa baanu.
But the actual content of the game is something else.	Nanso agoru no mu nsɛm ankasa yɛ biribi foforo.
I just love food.	M’ani gye aduan ho ara kwa.
We have most of the things available now.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma dodow no ara a ɛwɔ hɔ mprempren.
There is no easy way.	Ɔkwan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw biara nni hɔ.
He didn't want to be there anymore.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ bio.
You told me you had done that.	Woka kyerɛɛ me sɛ woayɛ saa.
There was always another time.	Ná bere foforo wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
I wasn’t too pretty.	Ná me ho nyɛ fɛ dodo.
I’m so happy for them.	M’ani agye yiye ma wɔn.
He will help you when you are weak in human power.	Ɔbɛboa wo bere a woayɛ mmerɛw wɔ nnipa tumi mu no.
He told us several times.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn mpɛn pii.
This is easy.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw.
You knew how much it meant to me.	Ná wunim sɛnea ɛho hia me kɛse.
They have done the same.	Saa ara na wɔn nso ayɛ.
It looked crowded, almost crowded.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ma, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na nnipa ahyɛ mu ma.
I'm so sorry you're not happy today.	Mepa wo kyɛw paa sɛ w'ani nnye nnɛ.
Later that night and again in the next.	Akyiri yi saa anadwo no ne bio wɔ nea edi hɔ no mu.
It should have been done years ago.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no mfe bi a atwam ni.
I think it doesn’t matter.	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
The squirrel of the squirrel.	Ɔkraman a ɔyɛ ɔkraman.
It’s yours now.	Ɛyɛ wo de mprempren.
He is absolutely perfect.	Ɔyɛ pɛ koraa.
It had to be power.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ tumi.
What I don’t do.	Nea menyɛ.
He showed me a picture.	Ɔde mfonini bi kyerɛɛ me.
There was no hope for me.	Ná anidaso biara nni hɔ mma me.
He was not at the table.	Ná onni pon so.
Examine your dog and see how your dog is doing.	Hwɛ wo kraman no mu na hwɛ sɛnea wo kraman te.
Everyone was busy, but someone would join him soon.	Ná obiara nni adagyew, nanso na obi bɛka ne ho nnansa yi ara.
This is interesting, you see.	Eyi yɛ anigye, wuhu.
You want to give it to me, great.	Wopɛ sɛ wode ma me, kɛse.
He hurried to work.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm kɔɔ adwuma.
And that does happen.	Na ɛno ba ampa.
It’s not that money itself is a bad thing.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ sika ankasa yɛ ade bɔne.
We spend a week doing this.	Yɛde dapɛn biako yɛ saa adwuma yi.
I went on with both of them.	Me ne wɔn baanu nyinaa kɔɔ so.
Would, again, be wrong.	Anka, bio, bedi mfomso.
He is strong.	Ɔyɛ den.
It all worked out.	Ne nyinaa yɛɛ yiye.
I think this is indeed the case.	Misusuw sɛ eyi te saa ampa.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani gye ho ankasa.
This was just a movie.	Ná eyi yɛ sini bi kɛkɛ.
This is all your fault.	Eyi nyinaa yɛ wo mfomso.
I can’t seem to get ahead of the game.	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nni agoru no anim.
It was a sin.	Ná ɛyɛ bɔne.
This doesn’t take long.	Eyi nnye bere tenten.
And, like our house, no friends.	Na, te sɛ yɛn fie no, nnamfo biara nni hɔ.
This road is usually closed to traffic.	Mpɛn pii no, kar fa kwan yi so ma.
That will be just fine.	Ɛno bɛyɛ yiye ara kwa.
Except for some users.	Gye sɛ wɔn a wɔde di dwuma no bi.
Tell him to do it.	Ka kyerɛ no sɛ ɔnyɛ.
I look away from him.	Mede m’ani m’ani fi ne ho.
The city doesn’t have enough buses.	Kurow no nni bɔs a ɛdɔɔso.
That’s what you have to do.	Ɛno ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
At least here below.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ha wɔ ase ha.
We need to do something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ biribi.
Make yourself known to them.	Ma wo ho nhu wɔn.
This will be exciting.	Eyi bɛyɛ anigye.
Here is also a picture of my actual car.	Me kar ankasa ho mfonini nso ni.
This car is easy to drive.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛka saa kar yi.
It’s not me doing it.	Ɛnyɛ me yɛ.
He is very good to his children.	Ɔyɛ papa paa ma ne mma.
At that point my legs were already very sore.	Saa bere no na me nan ase ayɛ me yaw kɛse dedaw.
It is not so.	Ɛnte saa.
And he was with her.	Na ɔne no wɔ hɔ.
It is perfect and flawless in every way.	Ɛyɛ pɛ na mfomso biara nni ho wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
It’s cold, too.	Awɔw nso.
It’s a real room.	Ɛyɛ dan ankasa.
That’s a big part of it.	Ɛno yɛ ne fã kɛse.
That is our plan.	Ɛno ne yɛn nhyehyɛe.
We were even doing it.	Ná yɛyɛ mpo.
It’s great, you know.	Ɛyɛ kɛse, wunim.
He put a note under his desk.	Ɔde krataa bi hyɛɛ ne pon ase.
He has someone else.	Ɔwɔ obi foforo.
He is a man of integrity.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a odi nokware.
The party was open to all.	Ná obiara betumi akɔ apontow no ase.
He was completely devoted to me.	Ná ɔde ne ho ama me koraa.
Someone has to follow through.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi di akyi.
The best should be good enough.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nea eye sen biara no yɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
The dog is in danger.	Ɔkraman no wɔ asiane mu.
There is hardly anyone outside.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara nni abɔnten.
I drive to work almost every day.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mede kar kɔ adwuma da biara.
I'm aiming for someone else.	Mede m’ani asi obi foforo so.
This is simply not true .	Eyi nyɛ nokware kɛkɛ .
Winter has finally arrived.	Awiei koraa no, awɔw bere aba.
We could really do with some other food.	Ná yebetumi de aduan foforo bi ayɛ ankasa.
The news shocked him.	Asɛm no maa ne ho dwiriw no.
Good bed access continues.	Mpa ho kwan pa kɔ so.
Otherwise, we have what we have.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, yɛwɔ nea yɛwɔ.
So he does that.	Enti ɔyɛ saa.
He doesn’t want anything to do with her anymore.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔne no bɛyɛ biribi bio.
He could win another victory.	Ná obetumi adi nkonim foforo.
Take the money.	Fa sika no.
How can I make it more efficient.	Ɔkwan bɛn so na metumi ama ayɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
Maybe it was my problem.	Ebia na ɛyɛ me haw.
I love my kids and I love being a mom.	M’ani gye me mma ho na m’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ maame.
This statement is not true.	Saa asɛm yi nyɛ nokware.
It was a beautiful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I feel great about it.	Mete nka kɛse wɔ ho.
I don’t think so.	M’adwene, ɛnte saa.
And, finally, remember this.	Na, nea etwa to no, kae eyi.
Look at him on the ground.	Hwɛ no wɔ fam.
But we have to do the work.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma no.
None of his friends saw him again.	Ne nnamfo no mu biara anhu no bio.
That was the most important thing.	Ná ɛno ne nea ɛho hia sen biara.
Snake looked out.	Ɔwɔ hwɛɛ ne ho fii adi.
Everyone somehow did.	Obiara ɔkwan bi so no na ɔyɛ.
Don’t get in the way.	Mma wo nkɔ kwan no mu.
He was unhappy, but there was nothing he could do.	Ná n’ani nnye, nanso na biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
Years and years and years of them.	Mfe ne mfe ne mfe a wɔde yɛɛ wɔn.
You can’t just say anything, you know?	Worentumi nka biribiara kɛkɛ, wunim?
I don’t think the current system is working.	Minsusuw sɛ mprempren nhyehyɛe no reyɛ adwuma.
That should get the job done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ma wɔyɛ adwuma no.
He knew it was there though.	Ná onim sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ nanso.
That’s a first for me.	Ɛno yɛ nea edi kan ma me.
Just look at you.	Hwɛ wo ara kwa.
I would like to add two more points.	Mepɛ sɛ meka nsɛm abien foforo ka ho.
Now I have resources.	Seesei mewɔ nneɛma a mede bɛyɛ adwuma.
Check out his comments.	Hwɛ ne nsɛm no.
After a while, a strong man walked up to them.	Bere tiaa bi akyi no, ɔbarima bi a ne ho yɛ den nantew baa wɔn nkyɛn.
But only here.	Nanso ha nkutoo.
He was involved in a number of cases.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ nsɛm dodow bi mu.
One is not too good.	Biako nyɛ papa dodo.
Make up your mind here.	Fa wo nsɛm no yɛ adwene wɔ ha.
I think it’s bigger now than ever.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse mprempren sen bere biara.
What he’s doing, no one else is doing.	Nea ɔreyɛ no, obi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɔreyɛ.
Not when we had it.	Ɛnyɛ bere a na yɛwɔ no.
Back to the first point.	San kɔ asɛm a edi kan no so.
But that’s only part of the problem.	Nanso ɛno yɛ ɔhaw no fã bi kɛkɛ.
How long before it feels start working please.	Bere tenten bɛn ansa na ɛte nka sɛ afi ase reyɛ adwuma mesrɛ wo.
That’s our window.	Ɛno ne yɛn mfɛnsere.
This is why repetition is so important.	Eyi nti na nsɛm a wɔka no mpɛn pii ho hia kɛse no.
You are a whole different story.	Wo de, woyɛ asɛm foforo koraa.
They are equally important.	Wɔn ho hia saa ara.
I believe this is wrong.	Migye di sɛ eyi yɛ mfomso.
I'm sure you'll just get better.	Migye di sɛ wo ho bɛtɔ wo ara kwa.
The strong take advantage of the weak.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ den no de wɔn a wɔyɛ mmerɛw no di dwuma.
Now I understand that this is a business like any business.	Seesei mete ase sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma te sɛ adwuma biara.
Very few people do that.	Nnipa kakraa bi pɛ na wɔyɛ saa.
He is a handsome man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
The kids are excited.	Mmofra no ani agye.
Outside, they stared at each other.	Wɔ abɔnten no, na wɔde wɔn ani kyerɛɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
It was like night and day.	Na ɛte sɛ anadwo ne awia.
This is it, the moment of truth.	Eyi ne no, nokware bere no.
Much better than that.	Pii a eye sen saa.
This is a serious problem.	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
He goes by many names.	Ɔde din ahorow pii kɔ.
The people have been united.	Nkurɔfo no ayɛ biako.
Do not go through the city.	Mfa kurow no mu nkɔ.
Something down.	Biribi asi.
I'm sorry about that.	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
That was another matter.	Ná ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo.
It shouldn’t have come as a surprise to anyone who knew me at the time.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ obiara a na onim me saa bere no nwonwa.
I was there too.	Ná me nso meda hɔ.
There are a few surprises, really.	Nnipa kakraa bi na ɛyɛ nwonwa, ankasa.
I want us to be friends.	Mepɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo.
The language did that.	Kasa no yɛɛ saa.
With him, you may do what you want.	Sɛ wo ne no wɔ hɔ a, ebia wobɛyɛ nea wopɛ.
We both enjoyed it.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa ani gyee ho.
This is the dog, they say.	Eyi ne ɔkraman no, wɔka.
Maybe never.	Ebia ɛnyɛ da.
Quickly gets out of harm’s way.	Ɔyɛ ntɛm fi asiane kwan so.
There was nothing wrong going on there.	Ná bɔne biara nni hɔ a ɛrekɔ so wɔ hɔ.
Water is very important.	Nsu ho hia kɛse.
But this had to be done.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi.
People were impressed.	Nkurɔfo ani gyee ho.
You weren't supposed to be outside.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ wowɔ abɔnten.
She patted the kitten.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ɔkraman ba no.
Start right now.	Fi ase mprempren ara.
It was home and always would be.	Ná ɛyɛ fie na na ɛbɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
I can’t believe it.	Mintumi nnye nni.
You have to work with everyone.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne obiara yɛ adwuma.
Tonight the bus is here.	Anadwo yi bɔs no aba ha.
There are many more.	Pii nso wɔ hɔ.
Talk to them.	Kasa kyerɛ wɔn.
I was shocked to hear that.	Me ho dwiriw me bere a metee saa asɛm no.
If he wants something done, he wants it done.	Sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi a, ɔpɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Looks good so far.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye de besi ha.
He was no longer conscious.	Ná onnim hwee bio.
If I may add to it.	Sɛ metumi de aka ho a.
I should have gone.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
My children were gone.	Ná me mma nni hɔ bio.
The police are gone now.	Polisifo no akɔ mprempren.
This is the problem in this case for us.	Eyi ne ɔhaw a ɛwɔ asɛm yi mu ma yɛn.
His mother is.	Ne maame yɛ.
I usually only see it in the summer.	Mpɛn pii no, awɔw bere mu nkutoo na mihu.
So you always have to measure.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw bere nyinaa.
Do it right, and it’s there.	Yɛ no yiye, na ɛwɔ hɔ.
That was their job.	Ná ɛno ne wɔn adwuma.
Not when you think about it.	Ɛnyɛ bere a wususuw ho no.
He loved this thing.	Ná n’ani gye saa ade yi ho.
That’s what we need to do.	Ɛno ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
It was a great day.	Ná ɛyɛ da kɛse.
This is easy.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw.
The house was beautiful, just as she liked it.	Ná ofie no yɛ fɛ, sɛnea na n’ani gye ho no ara pɛ.
And what one needs.	Na nea obi hia.
But the idea is great.	Nanso adwene no yɛ kɛse.
He was a wonderful man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ nwonwa.
Nothing else is included.	Biribi foforo biara nka ho.
For them, the only danger is that they do.	Wɔ wɔn fam no, asiane a ɛwɔ hɔ ara ne sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
No one knows why.	Obiara nnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
And he will be comfortable with it.	Na ne ho bɛtɔ no wɔ ho.
Winter is a beautiful time of year.	Awɔw bere yɛ afe no mu bere a ɛyɛ fɛ.
That’s the problem with the game.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw a ɛwɔ agoru no mu.
We do this every night, don’t we.	Yɛyɛ eyi anadwo biara, ɛnte saa.
There was no information available.	Ná nsɛm biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛma.
I know you know what it’s like.	Minim sɛ wunim sɛnea ɛte.
He told her not to do that again.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɔnyɛ saa bio.
It’s not even his idea.	Ɛnyɛ n’adwene mpo.
You have three.	Wowɔ abiɛsa.
It’s too scary.	Ɛyɛ hu dodo.
This is beside the point.	Eyi wɔ asɛm no nkyɛn.
So our population is fast food.	Enti yɛn nnipa dodow yɛ aduan a wɔde di ntɛmntɛm.
This was me now.	Ná eyi ne me mprempren.
And that doesn’t exist now.	Na ɛno nni hɔ mprempren.
Nor do people like it.	Saa ara nso na nkurɔfo ani nnye ho.
Not treating them right.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ wo ne wɔn bedi no yiye.
As such, it is no longer a game.	Sɛnea ɛte no, ɛnyɛ agoru bio.
However, this doesn’t work for me.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ adwuma mma me.
It’s very cold.	Ɛyɛ awɔw kɛse.
They very well can do that.	Wɔn yiye paa betumi ayɛ saa.
That house is awesome.	Saa fie no yɛ hu.
He didn't want to do this.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ eyi.
I was very impressed with him.	M’ani gyee ne ho paa.
The mind bothered him.	Adwene no haw no.
After that go to the movie and watch it.	Ɛno akyi no kɔ sini no mu na hwɛ.
It should be pretty nice.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
There are two problems with this approach.	Ɔhaw abien na ɛwɔ saa kwan yi mu.
It was a beautiful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
So, imagine this.	Enti, fa no sɛ eyi.
And that really means something.	Na ɛno kyerɛ biribi ankasa.
First, there were the people.	Nea edi kan no, na nnipa no wɔ hɔ.
It was a pleasant evening.	Ná ɛyɛ anwummere a ɛyɛ anigye.
That got their attention.	Ɛno maa wɔn adwene sii so.
I don’t know when.	Minnim bere bɛn.
It was very difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den yiye.
At least it seemed to him.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte ma no.
I don't know what the issue is.	Minnim nea asɛm no yɛ.
Anyone can say that.	Obiara betumi aka saa.
It’s when you add the people that things get complicated.	Ɛyɛ bere a wode nnipa no ka ho no na nneɛma mu yɛ den.
He had the kids in the back.	Ná ɔwɔ mmofra no wɔ akyi.
But that doesn’t work this time.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ adwuma saa bere yi.
He wants that about everyone.	Ɔpɛ saa asɛm no wɔ obiara ho.
You'll be surprised at what's there, maybe something you really like.	Nea ɛwɔ hɔ no bɛyɛ wo nwonwa, ebia biribi a w’ani gye ho ankasa.
Expect heavy traffic during peak hours.	Hwɛ kwan sɛ kar pii bɛba wɔ bere a nnipa pii kɔ hɔ no mu.
So this is interesting.	Enti eyi yɛ anigye.
She seemed nice enough.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ fɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
That’s what we all signed up for.	Ɛno ne nea yɛn nyinaa de yɛn nsa hyɛɛ ase.
You can’t win.	Worentumi nni nkonim.
Our time is up.	Yɛn bere no aba awiei.
But it’s not easy.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
Psychic powers if you will.	Adwene mu tumi ahorow sɛ wopɛ a.
I'm really looking forward to it.	Mehwɛ kwan ankasa.
Or it isn’t.	Anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
I had books.	Ná mewɔ nhoma ahorow.
He must have a reason.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔwɔ biribi a enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Finally, he nodded.	Awiei koraa no, ɔde ne ti too fam.
The work is of great importance.	Adwuma no ho hia kɛse.
It’s really hard to deliver the lyrics of a song well.	Ɛyɛ den ankasa sɛ wode nnwom bi mu nsɛm bɛma yiye.
But this is not really the case.	Nanso eyi nte saa ankasa.
I did give this to him.	Mede eyi maa no ampa.
He seemed familiar.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onim no yiye.
It was the ending.	Ná ɛyɛ awiei no.
I love this thing.	M’ani gye saa ade yi ho.
He was passionate about human rights.	Ná n’ani gye hokwan ahorow a nnipa wɔ ho.
I had one of those.	Ná mewɔ saa nneɛma no mu biako.
The street was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ abɔnten so ma.
That was exciting.	Ná ɛno yɛ anigye.
You can do this at home, folks.	Wubetumi ayɛ eyi wɔ fie, nkurɔfo.
Perhaps it is as it should be.	Ebia ɛte saa sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
And the variety is great.	Na ahorow ahorow no yɛ kɛse.
Well, don’t tell them.	Eye, nka nkyerɛ wɔn.
There is not much water here.	Nsu pii nni ha.
Just for you.	Wo nkutoo nti.
Just a little bit.	Kakraa bi kɛkɛ.
That’s how they do it.	Saa na wɔyɛ no.
Get back to your position.	San kɔ wo tebea mu.
At least it seemed that way.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
It was definitely a big problem.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛyɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
The same is true of humans.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nnipa fam.
That wasn’t necessary.	Ná ɛno ho nhia.
There is no doubt about that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
You can even play two games at the same time.	Wubetumi mpo adi agoru abien bere koro mu.
Look at the picture below.	Hwɛ mfonini a ɛwɔ ase ha no.
Where do you start with them.	Ɛhe na wode wɔn fi ase.
We are in one now.	Yɛwɔ biako mu mprempren.
It’s wonderful, no doubt about it.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno.
This house has many windows.	Saa ofie yi wɔ mfɛnsere pii.
It’s quick.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm.
I didn’t know what happened.	Ná minnim nea esii.
His hands were numb.	Ná ne nsa ayɛ mmerɛw.
This is what you like.	Eyi ne nea w’ani gye ho.
Or just get out.	Anaasɛ fi adi kɛkɛ.
No one had ever done that before.	Ná obiara nyɛɛ saa da.
He thought about that.	Osusuw saa asɛm no ho.
I have to keep reminding myself of that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so kae me ho saa asɛm no.
It is an easy product to work with.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛnyɛ den sɛ wode bɛyɛ adwuma.
Use "he" if you want to talk about someone.	Fa "ɔno" di dwuma sɛ wopɛ sɛ woka obi ho asɛm a.
He feels that he has some power over her.	Ɔte nka sɛ ɔwɔ tumi bi wɔ ne so.
You can never win.	Worentumi nni nkonim da.
The timing was crucial.	Ná bere a wɔde yɛɛ adwuma no ho hia kɛse.
Nothing but yourself and what you want to do.	Biribiara nni hɔ gye wo ho ne nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ.
But, say you want more.	Nanso, ka sɛ wopɛ pii.
Do what you have to do.	Yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Your picture is.	Wo mfonini no ne.
I am not the majority of people.	Menyɛ nnipa dodow no ara.
I could handle it.	Ná metumi adi ho dwuma.
This is one of the few.	Eyi yɛ kakraa bi no mu biako.
Maybe someone should, but you like it better the way it is.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ, nanso w’ani gye ho yiye sɛnea ɛte no.
I found the truth.	Mihuu nokware no.
The day was amazing and you both were great.	Da no yɛɛ nwonwa na mo baanu nyinaa yɛɛ kɛse.
And boy, was it fun.	Na abarimaa, so na ɛyɛ anigye.
Those are the words he would say.	Ɛno ne nsɛm a anka ɔbɛka.
I think this is a game.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ agoru.
Something strange was happening but he didn't know what.	Na biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa rekɔ so nanso na onnim nea.
He is such a wonderful person.	Ɔyɛ onipa a ɔyɛ nwonwa saa.
But he was either not in it or not.	Nanso na onni mu anaasɛ na onni mu.
The prospects are bright.	Anidaso no yɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
People heard about our story.	Nkurɔfo tee yɛn asɛm no ho asɛm.
Or a.	Anaasɛ a.
Tell me the truth.	Ka nokware kyerɛ me.
I think that’s impossible.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Every part of it.	Ne fã biara.
The importance of this point should not be forgotten.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛn werɛ fi hia a asɛm yi ho hia.
I can do that.	Metumi ayɛ saa.
So he wasn’t alone.	Enti na ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo.
No one knew where he was.	Ná obiara nnim baabi a ɔwɔ.
There is no such system.	Nhyehyɛe a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ.
He is the seed.	Ɔno ne aba no.
I told him that only yesterday.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​saa nnɛra nkutoo.
They looked at him with hope.	Wɔde anidaso hwɛɛ no.
Thus, it is very common today.	Enti, abu so kɛse nnɛ.
That was a scary thought.	Ná ɛno yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ hu.
I can’t help this.	Me ntumi nnye eyi ho.
Anyway, not really my money.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛnyɛ me sika ankasa.
That must be a mistake.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ mfomso.
I already do that.	Meyɛ saa dedaw.
The dog lies happily on the bed.	Ɔkraman no da mpa no so anigye so.
It’s everything you can do with it.	Ɛyɛ biribiara a wubetumi de ayɛ.
There is nothing we can do now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ mprempren.
Not even for hours.	Ɛnyɛ nnɔnhwerew pii mpo.
Things weren’t going well for me.	Ná nneɛma nkɔ yiye mma me.
It’s an awesome look.	Ɛyɛ hwɛ a ɛyɛ hu a wɔde hwɛ no.
Now you know why.	Seesei wunim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Nor does he care what he says.	Saa ara nso na nea ɔbɛka no mfa ne ho.
You touch them with your hands.	Wode wo nsa ka wɔn.
He was just doing it.	Ná ɔyɛ ara kwa.
Often, one can see that.	Mpɛn pii no, obi betumi ahu saa.
He’s a good kid.	Ɔyɛ abofra pa.
So this is what was behind it.	Enti eyi ne nea na ɛwɔ akyi.
I believe he could have.	Migye di sɛ anka obetumi.
And a strange human face.	Na onipa anim a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He put his stuff aside.	Ɔde ne nneɛma too nkyɛn.
Consider also language learning.	Susuw kasa ho adesua nso ho.
This was a mistake.	Ná eyi yɛ mfomso.
I’d love that too.	M’ani begye saa nso ho.
That’s the way it is.	Saa na ɛte.
He shouldn’t have been surprised.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no nwonwa.
This can take a very long time.	Eyi betumi agye bere tenten paa.
That party was too much fun.	Ná saa apontow no yɛ anigye dodo.
Whatever you want.	Sɛnea wopɛ biara.
None of that happened.	Ɛno mu biara amma.
He could use the help of the police.	Ná obetumi de polisifo mmoa adi dwuma.
That’s why we have tests.	Ɛno nti na yɛwɔ sɔhwɛ ahorow no.
I had a house once.	Ná mewɔ ofie bere bi.
Animals are not the issue.	Mmoa nyɛ asɛm no.
I felt completely at home.	Metee nka sɛ mewɔ fie koraa.
He didn’t want to go.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔbɛkɔ.
The method is easy, convenient and quick.	Ɔkwan no yɛ mmerɛw, ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ ntɛm.
I think people haven’t really thought about that yet.	Misusuw sɛ nkurɔfo nnya nsusuw saa asɛm no ho ankasa.
He didn't really want to touch her.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa bɛka no ankasa.
Everything alive here seems to come from here.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara a ɛte ase wɔ ha no fi ha.
Put it aside.	Fa too nkyɛn.
My turn had come.	Ná me dan aba.
This is what had happened for him.	Eyi ne nea na aba ama no.
What a wonderful time.	Bere pa bɛn ara ni.
All he knew was that he had to talk to her.	Nea na onim ara ne sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne no kasa.
There was something wet on the floor.	Ná biribi a ɛyɛ nsu wɔ fam hɔ.
I didn’t want this for you.	Na mempɛ eyi mma wo.
Only you can decide if that something is something you can handle.	Wo nkutoo na wubetumi asi gyinae sɛ ebia saa biribi no yɛ biribi a wubetumi adi ho dwuma anaa.
So, get out of here.	Enti, fi adi.
I know you wanted to surprise her tonight.	Minim sɛ na wopɛ sɛ woyɛ no nwonwa anadwo yi.
If you really want to, you will.	Sɛ wopɛ ampa a, wobɛyɛ saa.
And money is beautiful.	Na sika nso yɛ fɛ.
The people asked this.	Nkurɔfo no bisaa eyi.
I want you to consider his.	Mepɛ sɛ wususuw ne de ho.
So for him, it was okay.	Enti wɔ ne fam no, na asɛm biara nni ho.
His mind was bright and vibrant.	Ná n’adwene mu yɛ hyew na ɛyɛ hyew.
These things are just amazing.	Saa nneɛma yi yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
Take your hours.	Fa wo nnɔnhwerew no.
This is usually possible.	Mpɛn pii no, eyi betumi ayɛ yiye.
I live nearby.	Mete bɛn hɔ.
That was a big part of the game.	Ná ɛno yɛ agoru no fã kɛse.
The chapter had no name.	Ná ti no nni din biara.
It was a popular book.	Ná ɛyɛ nhoma a nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
And in that way.	Na saa kwan no so.
I want to hear an old story.	Mepɛ sɛ mete asɛm dedaw bi.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani gye ho paa.
He must have been for everyone.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɔyɛ ma obiara.
No one knew what to say next.	Ná obiara nnim nea ɔbɛka akyi.
Don’t be that kind of kid.	Mma wonyɛ abofra a ɔte saa.
It’s really cheap.	Ɛyɛ nea ne bo yɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
It even sleeps.	Ɛda mpo.
It’s hard to talk about.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka ho asɛm.
I know myself better than anyone knows me.	Minim me ho yiye sen obiara nim me.
Everything measured out.	Biribiara susuw fii mu.
Look at the real problem.	Hwɛ ɔhaw ankasa no.
He just wasn’t there.	Ná onni hɔ ara kwa.
Not that everyone here is innocent.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ obiara a ɔwɔ ha no ho nni asɛm.
It’s because of my state of mind.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ m’adwene tebea nti.
I want to talk about hope.	Mepɛ sɛ meka anidaso ho asɛm.
Hours of entertainment.	Nnɔnhwerew pii a wɔde gye wɔn ani.
Everything seems to be going well.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara rekɔ so yiye.
If you want information about yourself.	Sɛ wopɛ wo ho nsɛm a.
What a good boy he is.	Hwɛ abarimaa pa a ɔyɛ.
I am too busy today.	Minni adagyew dodo nnɛ.
The currency system is automatic.	Sika nhyehyɛe no yɛ nea wɔde wɔn ankasa yɛ.
The other man looked at him.	Ɔbarima foforo no hwɛɛ no.
So, this doesn’t happen.	Enti, eyi mma.
At least not unless you’re with someone who knows what he’s doing.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnte saa gye sɛ wo ne obi a onim nea ɔreyɛ no wɔ hɔ.
But it never looks like this.	Nanso ɛte sɛ eyi da.
I wish it were that way.	Me yam a anka ɛyɛ saa.
Something down.	Biribi asi.
I think we bring something new to the table.	Misusuw sɛ yɛde biribi foforo ba pon no so.
Price everything first.	Fa biribiara bo di kan.
Bring them to life.	Fa wɔn ba nkwa mu.
It’s a little difficult.	Ɛyɛ den kakra.
If not, play it.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, bɔ no.
She is young, articulate, and eloquent.	Ɔyɛ abofra, ɔka nsɛm yiye, na onim kasa yiye.
Shoes to wear.	Mpaboa a wɔde hyɛ.
This is working well.	Eyi reyɛ adwuma yiye.
He has a dog.	Ɔwɔ ɔkraman.
We can win again.	Yebetumi adi nkonim bio.
The pictures are gorgeous.	Mfonini ahorow no yɛ fɛ yiye.
Something told me he was inside.	Biribi ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ ɔwɔ mu.
That wasn’t the only one.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo ne.
Something similar is needed now again.	Biribi a ɛte saa ara ho hia mprempren bio.
They were introduced.	Wɔde hyɛɛ ase.
You must have done this before.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ woayɛ eyi pɛn.
It was all very strange to me.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ nwonwa yiye ma me.
I had never done that before.	Ná menyɛ saa da.
And it all happened so fast.	Na ne nyinaa sii ntɛmntɛm saa.
But the danger remains.	Nanso asiane no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Rely.	Fa wo ho to so.
He describes the quality of the food.	Ɔka sɛnea aduan no te ho asɛm.
As its name suggests, this condition usually occurs quickly.	Sɛnea ne din kyerɛ no, tebea yi taa ba ntɛmntɛm.
The house is very nice.	Ofie no yɛ fɛ yiye.
But he wasn’t.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ saa.
Again, another amazing meal!	Bio nso, aduan foforo a ɛyɛ nwonwa!
Tell me how you are doing.	Ka sɛnea wo ho te kyerɛ me.
That goes for any style of music.	Ɛno kɔ nnwom kwan biara so.
I apologize for this.	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ eyi ho.
However, none of that happened.	Nanso, ɛno mu biara amma.
He had no idea where he was.	Ná onni baabi a ɔwɔ ho adwene biara.
But there are many things a gun can do.	Nanso nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a tuo betumi ayɛ.
I'm in a state of shock.	Me ho ayɛ me yaw.
This looks amazing.	Eyi hwɛ yɛ nwonwa.
That’s not what he does.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea ɔyɛ.
Something needs to be done about it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi.
Nothing popular.	Biribiara nni hɔ a nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
Those are my favorite days.	Ɛno ne nna a m’ani gye ho paa.
This year was an amazing one.	Ná afe yi yɛ afe a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Afternoon or evening.	Awia anaa anwummere.
I need to talk to him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa.
Naturally, you want to do well.	Sɛnea ɛte no, wopɛ sɛ woyɛ yiye.
The same people keep coming back.	Nnipa koro no ara kɔ so san ba.
His opportunity was over.	Ná hokwan a ɔwɔ no aba awiei.
Or, at least, at least.	Anaasɛ, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
So thank you very much.	Enti meda mo ase pii.
I don’t like it at all.	M’ani nnye ho koraa.
He knew we had him.	Ná onim sɛ yɛwɔ no.
They weren’t interested.	Ná wɔn ani nnye ho.
Food was scarce.	Ná aduan ho yɛ na.
And so he had every reason to.	Na enti na ɔwɔ biribiara a enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
But he likes the food.	Nanso ɔpɛ aduan no.
The same one your mother uses.	Nea wo maame de di dwuma no ara.
I want you to be successful and more importantly.	Mepɛ sɛ woyɛ obi a odi yiye na ɛho hia kɛse.
So it has to be an issue.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ asɛm.
Two and a half hours.	Nnɔnhwerew abien ne fã.
They are among the best scenes of the film.	Wɔka sini no mu sini ahorow a eye sen biara no ho.
You had to practice and practice.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu na wode wo ho hyɛ mu.
The same thing in every city.	Ade koro no ara ara wɔ kurow biara mu.
He wanted me to go back with him.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ me ne no san kɔ ne nkyɛn.
The situation is as it is.	Tebea no te sɛ nea ɛte.
Don’t be surprised.	Mma wo ho nyɛ wo nwonwa.
I barely know you.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ minnim wo.
Something that you need to do.	Biribi a ɛho hia sɛ woyɛ.
This cannot continue.	Eyi ntumi nkɔ so.
That’s very important to my book.	Ɛno ho hia me nhoma no yiye.
I thought there was something.	Misusuwii sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ.
If you are one.	Sɛ woyɛ biako a.
If so, everyone would be doing it.	Sɛ ɛte saa a, anka obiara reyɛ.
I need to hear what you think.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete nea wususuw.
They are just jealous of my son.	Wɔn ani bere me ba no ara kwa.
It was our own fault.	Ná ɛyɛ yɛn ankasa mfomso.
I couldn’t see it clearly.	Ná mintumi nhu no yiye.
There was still opportunity.	Ná hokwan da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Hopefully it was still working.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ na ɛda so ara yɛ adwuma.
But if someone takes away some other ideas, that's fine.	Nanso sɛ obi gye adwene foforo bi fi hɔ a, eye.
Much, much so absolutely.	Pii, pii saa koraa.
There was no study.	Ná adesua biara nni hɔ.
You seemed happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea w’ani agye.
That’s tomorrow.	Ɛno ne ɔkyena.
For my mom, not so much.	Me maame fam no, ɛnyɛ kɛse saa.
But they are not alone.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wɔn nkutoo na wɔyɛ saa.
The more you do.	Dodow a woyɛ pii no.
Does anyone have any idea what is going on.	So obi wɔ nea ɛrekɔ so no ho adwene bi.
I think the city did as well.	Misusuw sɛ kurow no nso yɛɛ saa ara.
Only when necessary.	Bere a ɛho hia nkutoo.
And a lot of work, too.	Na adwuma pii nso.
During the weekend.	Wɔ dapɛn awiei no mu.
It’s really amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
You can see their eyes clearly.	Wubetumi ahu wɔn ani yiye.
But not all of the information is bad.	Nanso nsɛm no nyinaa nyɛ bɔne.
You don’t have to accept it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wugye tom.
And that’s not an issue down here.	Na ɛno nyɛ asɛm a ɛwɔ fam ha.
He would do it.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ.
I just loved working with him.	Ná m’ani gye ho ara kwa sɛ me ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
You are the only one.	Wo nkutoo na woyɛ.
I have to tell you everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribiara kyerɛ wo.
Now it’s for a different team.	Seesei ɛyɛ kuw foforo bi de.
I am among the best.	Meka wɔn a wɔyɛ papa sen biara no ho.
It’s far too painful.	Ɛyɛ yaw dodo koraa.
In the summer.	Wɔ awɔw bere mu.
I love this moment.	M’ani gye saa bere yi ho.
They were strong.	Ná wɔyɛ den.
With one hand.	Ɔde ne nsa biako.
Not tonight, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ anadwo yi, ɔkwan biara so.
It was really happening.	Ná ɛrekɔ so ankasa.
Nothing needed to be said.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ wɔka biribiara.
You might say it was an accident, and so it is.	Ebia wobɛka sɛ ɛyɛ akwanhyia, na saa ara na ɛte.
This works now.	Eyi yɛ adwuma mprempren.
Look at him.	Hwɛ no.
So they say.	Enti wɔka sɛ.
The house looks really nice.	Ofie no hwɛ yɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
Expect the same.	Hwɛ kwan saa ara.
I think this is just great.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ kɛse ara kwa.
The situation was desperate.	Ná tebea no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
I am tall and strong.	Me tenten na me ho yɛ den.
In that, but not in everything.	Wɔ ɛno mu, nanso ɛnyɛ biribiara mu.
Something went wrong here.	Biribi anyɛ yiye wɔ ha.
An old car.	Kar dedaw bi.
I'm pretty sure it's more likely the latter.	Migye di yiye sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea etwa to no.
We have a number of them as well.	Yɛwɔ wɔn dodow bi nso.
One of those would be the constant use of two legs.	Ɛno mu biako bɛyɛ sɛ nan abien a wɔde di dwuma bere nyinaa no bɛba.
That got him interested today.	Ɛno maa n’ani gyee ho nnɛ.
There are many people who love animals.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ a wɔn ani gye mmoa ho.
It was also in my house.	Ná ɛwɔ me fie nso.
But every great man has done so.	Nanso onipa kɛse biara ayɛ saa.
And still, it felt like a bad thing.	Na ɛda so ara, na ɛte sɛ ade bɔne.
I don't know why he did that either.	Minnim nea enti a ɔyɛɛ saa nso.
This picture is very clear.	Saa mfonini yi mu da hɔ yiye.
But the only thing we can do is do our best.	Nanso ade biako pɛ a yebetumi ayɛ ne sɛ yɛbɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara.
The only thing that is scary is that it is scary.	Nea ɛyɛ hu nkutoo ne sɛ ɛyɛ hu.
That, to me, is the point.	Ɛno, wɔ me fam no, ne asɛm a ɛwɔ mu.
I could go on and on.	Ná metumi akɔ so ayɛ saa.
Take a closer look.	Hwɛ no yiye.
So, what do we do now?	Enti, dɛn na yɛyɛ mprempren?
His name was like a song.	Ná ne din te sɛ nnwom dwom.
The house still exists today.	Ofie no da so ara wɔ hɔ nnɛ.
Don’t deal with him.	Wo ne no nni nsɛm.
At least on paper.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ krataa so.
That was his first and last mistake.	Ɛno ne ne mfomso a edi kan ne nea etwa to.
Nothing too complicated.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ den dodo.
Most people found the job difficult.	Nnipa dodow no ara hui sɛ adwuma no yɛ den.
It may be a mistake.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ mfomso.
But if you want, we can start over.	Nanso sɛ wopɛ a, yebetumi afi ase bio.
Maybe that’s okay, maybe not.	Ebia ɛno nyɛ hwee, ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
You have the power.	Wowɔ tumi no.
All systems appear to be working normally.	Ɛte sɛ nea nhyehyɛe ahorow no nyinaa reyɛ adwuma sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Otherwise, do something else.	Anyɛ saa a, yɛ biribi foforo.
And nothing could be more certain.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nokware sen saa.
I cannot thank you enough.	Mintumi nna wo ase sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He looked down at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ fam.
So, what are we going to do about it?	Enti, dɛn na yɛbɛyɛ wɔ ho?
And maybe in his mind, it seemed that way.	Na ebia wɔ n’adwene mu no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
I feel like that’s a full-time job in itself. 	Mete nka sɛ ɛno ankasa yɛ bere nyinaa adwuma. 
My mom didn’t tell me that.	Me maame anka saa ankyerɛ me.
I'm telling you.	Meka kyerɛ mo.
But you can be of great help to that person.	Nanso wubetumi aboa saa onipa no kɛse.
So, even the children of the police.	Enti, polisifo no mma mpo.
The product is very expensive.	Ade no bo yɛ den yiye.
For all that.	Ne nyinaa nti.
There is a party.	Apontow bi wɔ hɔ.
Or maybe no one knows that.	Anaasɛ ebia obiara nnim saa.
His hands were on my legs.	Ná ne nsa da me nan so.
Everyone did bad things.	Obiara yɛɛ nneɛma bɔne.
I would have given it.	Anka mede bɛma.
He was an only child.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra koro pɛ.
This was not my intention.	Ná eyi nyɛ m’adwene.
You’re the one on it.	Wo na wowɔ so.
Complexity is part of human language.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ den yɛ nnipa kasa fã.
Everyone knows everything.	Obiara nim biribiara.
There has to be a story in it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ asɛm bi wɔ mu.
The overall workflow is very simple.	Adwuma a wɔyɛ no nyinaa no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
They are very expensive.	Wɔn bo yɛ den yiye.
It’s all about the mind.	Ne nyinaa fa adwene no ho.
If your plan is working, just stay in the course.	Sɛ wo nhyehyɛe no reyɛ adwuma a, tra adesua no mu kɛkɛ.
People never fail to surprise them.	Nkurɔfo ntumi mma wɔn ho dwiriw wɔn da.
Every year, a carnival is held here.	Afe biara, wɔyɛ apontow bi wɔ ha.
You may even be making water for him.	Ebia woreyɛ nsu mpo ama no.
But there is nothing you could have done.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a anka wubetumi ayɛ.
You need to do something about that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa asɛm no ho biribi.
It’s a good day.	Ɛyɛ da pa.
They don’t like what you do to them.	Wɔn ani nnye nea woyɛ wɔn no ho.
So eat as much as you want.	Enti di dodow biara a wopɛ.
That’s just me.	Ɛno ne me nkutoo.
This is the way it always worked.	Eyi ne ɔkwan a na ɛyɛ adwuma bere nyinaa.
He seems so perfect.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ pɛ saa.
Everyone wants to be good.	Obiara pɛ sɛ ɔyɛ papa.
But something did happen to me.	Nanso biribi too me ampa.
It would seem that you have done well.	Ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea woayɛ no yiye.
We couldn’t have done that.	Anka yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
He knew what he had in his wife.	Ná onim nea ɔwɔ wɔ ne yere mu.
It’s not that hard to do.	Ɛnyɛ den saa sɛ wobɛyɛ.
It was just a matter of time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere ara kwa.
He is in a vulnerable position.	Ɔwɔ tebea a ɛyɛ mmerɛw mu.
He worries that the plan might affect the bottom line.	Ɔhaw ne ho sɛ ebia nhyehyɛe no bɛka nea ɛwɔ fam no.
I felt like a kid again.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ abofra bio.
At his father's house.	Wɔ ne papa fie.
It is a very powerful force.	Ɛyɛ tumi kɛse paa.
You can’t convince anyone.	Worentumi mma obiara nnye nni.
We keep going.	Yɛ kɔ so.
I have a lot to tell you.	Mewɔ nsɛm pii a mɛka akyerɛ wo.
But that’s it.	Nanso ɛno ne no.
Nothing should look perfect.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ biribiara te sɛ nea edi mũ.
The project was a success.	Adwuma no dii yiye.
But it’s not any good.	Nanso ɛnyɛ papa biara.
We can leave in the morning.	Yebetumi afi hɔ anɔpa.
You are with me the whole day.	Wo ne me wɔ hɔ da mũ no nyinaa.
For many years now.	Mfe pii ni ni.
He’s a great guy.	Ɔyɛ kɛse.
I can’t take this anymore!	Mintumi mfa eyi bio!
That plan doesn’t work.	Saa nhyehyɛe no nkɔ yiye.
I think there are some positives.	Misusuw sɛ nneɛma pa bi wɔ hɔ.
One thing to consider is the age of the child.	Ade biako a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho ne mfe a abofra no adi.
It’s the last day of school.	Ɛyɛ sukuu da a etwa to.
Maybe we don’t need to.	Ebia ɛho nhia sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
I know better now.	Minim yiye mprempren.
The time to act is now.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi ne mprempren.
And you don’t either.	Na wo nso wonyɛ saa.
And it was good that he did.	Na eye sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
Designed and conducted most of the studies.	Ɔyɛɛ adesua dodow no ara ho nhyehyɛe na ɔyɛɛ no.
He did everything hard.	Ɔyɛɛ biribiara denneennen.
The project didn’t go very far.	Adwuma no ankɔ akyiri koraa.
I love what you do.	M’ani gye nea woyɛ no ho.
He has some rights.	Ɔwɔ hokwan ahorow bi.
So many of my friends don’t have it.	Enti me nnamfo pii nni bi.
His hand was gone.	Ná ne nsa no nni hɔ bio.
I just can’t believe it.	Mintumi nnye nni kɛkɛ.
They are not an end in themselves.	Wɔn ankasa nyɛ awiei.
The book contains many facts.	Nsɛm pii a ɛyɛ nokware wɔ nhoma no mu.
He knows he can.	Onim sɛ obetumi.
It seems to be the case.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
He’s just that guy.	Ɔyɛ saa ɔbarima no ara kwa.
You can’t imagine the reality of the situation.	Worentumi nsusuw sɛnea tebea no te ankasa ho.
He had to be equal to me.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne me yɛ pɛ.
But even this seemed human.	Nanso na eyi mpo te sɛ nea wɔyɛ nnipa.
That can’t be good.	Ɛno ntumi nyɛ papa.
So it looks like it’s going to be interesting.	Enti ɛte sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
Look, it’s just hard.	Hwɛ, ɛyɛ den ara kwa.
Many people saw the accident.	Nnipa pii huu akwanhyia no.
Later, he told himself.	Akyiri yi, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho.
There was no mistake, it was definitely him.	Na mfomso biara nni hɔ, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛyɛ ɔno.
He will be used.	Wɔde no bɛyɛ adwuma.
You can have something else if you want.	Wubetumi anya biribi foforo sɛ wopɛ a.
I keep coming back to that.	Mekɔ so san ba saa asɛm no so.
It doesn’t matter what you think.	Nea wususuw ho no mfa ho.
Or should it anyway.	Anaasɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔkwan biara so.
First, she was really nice.	Nea edi kan no, na ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
Too great a risk.	Asiane kɛse dodo.
It was a great job.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
The days are long now.	Nna no yɛ tenten mprempren.
He was the only one who signed.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ ase.
That is not entirely unknown to me.	Ɛno nyɛ nea minnim koraa.
In some cases.	Wɔ nsɛm bi mu no.
Or somewhere.	Anaasɛ baabi.
It was a lot of fun.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
This road leaves the city.	Saa kwan yi fi kurow no mu.
I'll be happy with it.	M'ani begye ho.
It was the first part of the summer that this happened.	Ɛyɛ awɔw bere no fã a edi kan a eyi sii.
But I can’t see it.	Nanso me ntumi nhu.
He knows how to tell a story.	Onim sɛnea wɔka asɛm bi.
That is the end of the matter.	Ɛno ne asɛm no awiei.
The city will pay.	Kurow no bɛbɔ ka.
I wanted both.	Ná mepɛ abien no nyinaa.
There was something else about him.	Na biribi foforo nso wɔ ne ho.
You're strong, you.	Wo ho yɛ den, wo.
All in all, a great time.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɛyɛ bere kɛse.
His father, too.	Ne papa nso.
I heard it.	Metee no.
Walked away into the night.	Nantew fii hɔ kɔɔ anadwo no mu.
How you can touch me so fast.	Sɛnea wubetumi aka me ntɛmntɛm saa.
Live in the present.	Tra ase wɔ mprempren tebea no mu.
People have rights.	Nkurɔfo wɔ hokwan ahorow.
Sounds pretty complicated, doesn’t it?	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den yiye, ɛnte saa?
You know me better than that.	Wunim me yiye sen saa.
This is not about you.	Eyi nyɛ wo ho asɛm.
Accidents are relatively common in this city.	Akwanhyia abu so wɔ kurow yi mu kakra.
That doesn’t matter now.	Ɛno ho nhia mprempren.
You’re terrible.	Wo ho yɛ hu.
This time it’s stable.	Saa bere yi deɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
There was only water now.	Ná nsu nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ mprempren.
Not now, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren, ɔkwan biara so.
That’s a lot for me.	Ɛno yɛ pii ma me.
This is simply not true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware kɛkɛ.
Don’t tell people anything.	Nka asɛm biara nkyerɛ nkurɔfo.
Even if that’s the case.	Sɛ ɛno mpo a.
I don’t know anything.	Minnim hwee.
That makes it a little harder.	Ɛno ma ɛyɛ den kakra.
I just know it, all of it.	Minim no ara kwa, ne nyinaa.
And he was thrilled with her.	Na n’ani gyee ne ho.
So it’s even more difficult.	Enti ɛyɛ den kɛse mpo.
I'm going to trust you.	Mede me ho to wo so.
But acting quickly is not easy.	Nanso ade a wobɛyɛ ntɛm no nyɛ mmerɛw.
There were many of them.	Ná wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
It would be so much better if it wasn’t us.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ yɛn a, anka ɛbɛyɛ papa kɛse.
Our team was able to get it back.	Yɛn kuw no tumi san nyaa no bio.
That is certainly true.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
This picture has gotten a lot weaker, over the years.	Saa mfonini yi ayɛ mmerɛw kɛse, wɔ mfe no mu.
Big, solid and perfect.	Kɛse, ɛyɛ den na ɛyɛ pɛ.
I have often been surprised.	Mpɛn pii no, ayɛ me nwonwa.
It would have been better.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ papa.
It’s my friends.	Ɛyɛ me nnamfo.
Or he knew her.	Anaasɛ na onim no.
My father was one of them.	Ná me papa yɛ wɔn mu biako.
I couldn’t sleep.	Ná mintumi nna.
It doesn’t matter in the end.	Ɛho nhia awiei koraa.
That he had enough money so he didn’t have to work anymore.	Sɛ na ɔwɔ sika a ɛdɔɔso enti na enhia sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma bio.
And it has worked for me.	Na ayɛ adwuma ama me.
You do what you have to do.	Woyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
And it really was.	Na ɛte saa ankasa.
I can’t prove it to myself.	Mintumi nkyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware nkyerɛ me ho.
It was too much.	Ná ɛdɔɔso dodo.
He kicks her.	Ɔde ne nan bɔ no.
This is very close.	Eyi bɛn paa.
He's good with his hands.	Ɔyɛ papa wɔ ne nsa ho.
I don't know about studies though.	Minnim adesua ahorow nanso.
But it’s not what it looks like anyway.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛte wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
Buses run into the city.	Bɔs ahorow tu mmirika kɔ kurow no mu.
He knows nothing about anything.	Onnim biribiara ho hwee.
A man everyone admired.	Ɔbarima a obiara ani gyee ne ho.
There is a job.	Adwuma bi wɔ hɔ.
There were two more days left.	Ná aka nna abien bio.
I talked to him about it again today.	Me ne no kaa ho asɛm bio nnɛ.
But it seems like a difficult thing to do.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ.
I know we have a lot going on.	Minim sɛ yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛrekɔ so.
Or eat it.	Anaasɛ di no.
Get them out tonight.	Yi wɔn fi mu anadwo yi.
I’m going to school.	Mekɔ sukuu.
Not an idea as to why exactly.	Ɛnyɛ adwene sɛ nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa.
Water is life itself.	Nsu yɛ nkwa ankasa.
Always be alert and fearful.	Ma w’ani nna hɔ na suro bere nyinaa.
But first of all.	Nanso nea edi kan no.
Which I’m very fond of.	A m’ani gye ho paa.
It was really like a movie.	Ná ɛte sɛ sini bi ankasa.
He should have thought more about it.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ osusuw ho kɛse.
That poor quality car.	Saa kar a ɛnyɛ papa no.
It should be fun.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
Classes are still ongoing today.	Adesua ahorow da so ara kɔ so nnɛ.
I just can’t do it.	Me ntumi nyɛ yiye kɛkɛ.
He wanted a home.	Ná ɔpɛ ofie.
Check it out here!.	Hwɛ no wɔ ha!.
He didn't want it to be any part of him.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ne fã biara.
It seems like a very smart thing to do.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ade a nyansa wom yiye.
I am in this whole situation.	Mewɔ saa tebea yi nyinaa mu.
Or in the past.	Anaasɛ bere a atwam no.
Just one of many problems.	Ɔhaw pii no mu biako pɛ.
He is too dangerous.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hu dodo.
He told me so himself.	Ɔno ankasa ka kyerɛɛ me saa.
Can you give me a hand?	So wubetumi ama me nsa?
The meeting was a success.	Nhyiam no dii yiye.
So long then.	Enti bere tenten saa bere no.
I don’t know anything else to tell you.	Minnim biribi foforo biara a mɛka akyerɛ wo.
And it was indeed awesome.	Na na ɛyɛ hu ampa.
Run out the door!	Tu mmirika fi ɔpon no ano!
You had a plan.	Ná wowɔ nhyehyɛe bi.
As a result, it is not cheap.	Ne saa nti, ɛnyɛ nea ne bo yɛ mmerɛw.
He wanted to do more.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ pii sen saa.
Not on that day.	Ɛnyɛ saa da no.
I had to go to the back door.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ akyi pon no ano.
Beat until smooth.	Bɔ no kosi sɛ ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
He was in a strange mood.	Ná ɔwɔ adwene bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa mu.
And it had to be.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
But it looks like he will eventually.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea awiei koraa no ɔbɛyɛ saa.
Human rights.	Hokwan ahorow a nnipa wɔ.
I have another project to do.	Mewɔ adwuma foforo bi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
I am all important.	Me nyinaa ho hia.
However, that is not the case here.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte wɔ ha.
So you can’t go wrong.	Enti worentumi nkɔ bɔne mu.
A cat peered through the window.	Ɔkraman bi hwɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
It was obviously no good.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛnyɛ papa biara.
He does this all the time.	Ɔyɛ eyi bere nyinaa.
Here is the story.	Asɛm no ni.
Again, thank you.	Bio nso, meda wo ase.
Only his father could.	Ná ne papa nkutoo na obetumi.
This was a common occurrence.	Ná eyi yɛ ade a abu so.
Assume the latter.	Fa no sɛ nea etwa to no.
The city was deserted.	Ná kurow no mu ayɛ kwa.
You can come here.	Wubetumi aba ha.
The important thing is.	Ade a ɛho hia no.
So we have a very big problem on our hands.	Enti yɛwɔ ɔhaw kɛse paa wɔ yɛn nsa so.
A crowded school can be dangerous for a child.	Sukuu a nnipa ahyɛ mu ma no betumi ayɛ asiane ama abofra.
That is certainly possible.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye.
He knew it would be hard for him to do this.	Ná onim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ den ama no sɛ ɔbɛyɛ eyi.
There was someone inside me.	Ná obi wɔ me mu.
It’s just a school.	Ɛyɛ sukuu ara kwa.
Look, why not .	Hwɛ, dɛn nti na wonyɛ .
But the money has to come from somewhere.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ sika no fi baabi.
Both are important.	Nneɛma abien no nyinaa ho hia.
And, at least we have each other.	Na, anyɛ yiye koraa no, yɛwɔ yɛn ho yɛn ho.
It’s not a party.	Ɛnyɛ apontow bi.
It’s not a dog either.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkraman nso.
I am worse than they are.	Meyɛ bɔne sen wɔn.
There are usually a variety of uses.	Mpɛn pii no, nneɛma ahorow ahorow wɔ hɔ a wɔde di dwuma.
Don’t touch that.	Mfa wo nsa nka saa asɛm no.
Need help with this.	Hia mmoa wɔ eyi ho.
But it’s true that part of me did.	Nanso ɛyɛ nokware sɛ me fã bi yɛɛ saa.
They were really, really hard.	Ná wɔyɛ den ankasa, ankasa.
It seemed to be that too.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛno nso.
It’s early, so there’s still time.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm, enti bere da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Probably because of many of them.	Ebia wɔn mu pii nti.
You're out here now.	Wowɔ abɔnten ha seesei.
I can’t tell you right now.	Mintumi nka nkyerɛ wo mprempren ara.
We loved the house.	Ná yɛn ani gye ofie no ho.
Too crowded with business.	Nnwuma ahyɛ no ma dodo.
I think it’s because he knows something.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ sɛ onim biribi.
You knew it was him.	Ná wunim sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno.
I have been here for years.	Mede mfe pii aba ha.
I’m a little interested in that, too.	M’ani gye ho kakra wɔ saa asɛm no ho, nso.
You just get what happened.	Wo nsa ara nea esii.
The bed was very comfortable.	Ná mpa no yɛ fɛ yiye.
Almost nothing.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biribiara nni hɔ.
Whether it has worked for them or not.	Sɛ ayɛ adwuma ama wɔn anaasɛ ɛnte saa a.
I just want to feel .	Mepɛ sɛ mete nka ara kwa sɛ .
At this point, nothing else matters.	Saa bere yi de, biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛho hia.
But keep trying.	Nanso kɔ so bɔ mmɔden.
I didn’t know what to do!	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ!
He takes a problem.	Ɔde ɔhaw bi fa.
I want to take my wife.	Mepɛ sɛ mede me yere kɔ.
An error has occurred.	Mfomso bi aba.
So it would be very busy today.	Enti anka ɛbɛyɛ nea adagyew nnim koraa nnɛ.
Maybe it’s everyone’s plan.	Ebia ɛyɛ obiara nhyehyɛe.
I think it’s wonderful.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It’s all very exciting.	Ne nyinaa yɛ anigye kɛse.
Our hair grew.	Yɛn ti nhwi yɛɛ kɛse.
At least that’s what you told me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne nea woka kyerɛɛ me.
It’s hard and it’s hard.	Ɛyɛ den na ɛyɛ den.
Straight.	Tee.
I'm just good at it though.	Meyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw wɔ mu kɛkɛ nanso.
It’s such an important issue for me.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛho hia saa ma me.
He didn't know he would.	Ná onnim sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
Eventually, they were drowned.	Awiei koraa no, nsu faa wɔn.
He didn't have to think about it for too long.	Ná enhia sɛ osusuw ho bere tenten dodo.
I have most of those books, with a few exceptions.	Mewɔ saa nhoma ahorow no mu dodow no ara, gye kakraa bi.
I need to know how he did it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea ɔyɛɛ saa.
That would create a problem here and at home.	Ɛno bɛma ɔhaw bi aba ha ne fie.
He ran over the subject.	Ɔde mmirika faa asɛm no ho.
Always full of positive thoughts.	Adwene pa ahyɛ no ma bere nyinaa.
But now this issue is more questionable.	Nanso mprempren asɛm yi yɛ nea asɛm wɔ ho kɛse.
There was something going on with that girl.	Na biribi rekɔ so wɔ saa abeawa no ho.
I am doing it anyway.	Mereyɛ no ɔkwan biara so.
But the problem continued.	Nanso ɔhaw no kɔɔ so.
Time had passed so quickly.	Ná bere atwam ntɛmntɛm saa.
He decided to say that.	Ɔyɛɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛka saa.
Something else was going on.	Ná biribi foforo nso rekɔ so.
Something bad will happen.	Biribi bɔne bɛba.
How many people does this story have?	Nnipa dodow ahe na saa asɛm yi wɔ?
The whole thing is the same.	Asɛm no nyinaa te saa ara.
It’s a bit old school but it works.	Ɛyɛ sukuu dedaw kakra nanso ɛyɛ adwuma.
There was something very alive about him.	Ná biribi a ɛte ase yiye wɔ ne ho.
The same is true of jobs.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nnwuma ho.
I was among them.	Ná meka wɔn ho.
Talk about being vulnerable.	Ka sɛnea wobɛyɛ obi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw ho asɛm.
There is no help for him.	Mmoa biara nni hɔ mma no.
That would have been a disaster.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ asiane kɛse.
And one leg was shorter than the other.	Na na ne nan biako yɛ tiaa sen biako no.
Nonetheless, not necessarily.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɛnyɛ nea ɛte saa ankasa.
That’s really what it’s like to be me.	Ɛno ne sɛnea ɛte ankasa sɛ meyɛ me.
These things are just fun.	Saa nneɛma yi yɛ anigye ara kwa.
He wasn’t pretty at all.	Ná ɔnyɛ fɛ koraa.
This dog needs a good home.	Saa ɔkraman yi hia ofie pa.
But you are on your very last chance.	Nanso wowɔ wo hokwan a etwa to koraa no so.
Their lives were always in danger.	Ná wɔn nkwa da asiane mu bere nyinaa.
It was an important job.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛho hia.
I am very attractive and attractive.	Me ho yɛ fɛ yiye na me ho yɛ fɛ.
What a fascinating book!	Nhoma a ɛyɛ anigye bɛn ara ni!
He becomes more sensitive to you.	Ɔbɛyɛ obi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw kɛse wɔ wo ho.
Ourselves are the only thing.	Yɛn ankasa nkutoo ne ade a ɛwɔ hɔ.
She was always beautiful.	Na ne ho yɛ fɛ bere nyinaa.
He's just in the other room.	Ɔwɔ dan foforo no mu ara kwa.
And it was cold.	Na awɔw wom.
Nothing here is old fashioned.	Biribiara nni ha a ɛyɛ dedaw.
I think this system should work.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ saa nhyehyɛe yi yɛ adwuma.
I see him.	Mihu no.
They were happy for him as a person.	Ná wɔn ani gye ma no sɛ onipa.
Always do your best.	Yɛ nea wubetumi biara bere nyinaa.
That car is right there.	Saa kar no wɔ hɔ ara.
It doesn’t seem to work.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ adwuma.
They are the real reason we exist.	Wɔn ne nea enti a yɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
None of them are really doing it.	Wɔn mu biara nyɛ nea ɔreyɛ ankasa wɔ ho.
Maybe he didn’t like it.	Ebia na n’ani nnye ho.
And why not.	Na dɛn nti na ɛnte saa.
And so it’s easy to do.	Na enti ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobɛyɛ.
Get over yourself, quick!	Fa wo ho to wo ho so, ntɛm!
Serve at room temperature or cold.	Fa ma wɔ dan mu hyew mu anaasɛ awɔw wom.
That one was really weird.	Ná saa biako no yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
Something.	Biribi.
This was very close.	Ná eyi bɛn paa.
You’re wet too.	Wo nso woayɛ nsu.
Her hair was down.	Ná ne ti nhwi no akɔ fam.
Look, just forget it.	Hwɛ, wo werɛ mfi kɛkɛ.
So good for you!!.	Enti eye ma wo!!.
That’s how he is.	Saa na ɔte.
First, the	Nea edi kan no, a .
And yet he seems to have done so.	Na nanso ɛte sɛ nea wayɛ saa.
I organize things.	Meyɛ nneɛma ho nhyehyɛe.
All but one.	Ne nyinaa gye biako pɛ.
I know this is a big year for me.	Minim sɛ eyi yɛ afe kɛse ma me.
You can have the house.	Wubetumi anya ofie no.
They had given all there was.	Ná wɔde nea ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa ama.
Every year, more people come to the city.	Afe biara na nnipa pii ba kurow no mu.
It was beautiful enough.	Na ɛyɛ fɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Do you want some?	Wopɛ bi?
I believe there are a few.	Migye di sɛ kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Feed the children and put them to bed.	Ma mmofra no aduan na fa wɔn to mpa so.
In other words,.	Wɔ nsɛm foforo mu no,.
But everything will be fine.	Nanso biribiara bɛyɛ yiye.
The city has grown tremendously.	Kurow no ayɛ kɛse kɛse.
I can easily reach the same conclusion.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ metumi adu asɛm koro no ara ho.
The same goes for the present.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ mprempren no ho.
It’s pretty cool, isn’t it?	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye, ɛnte saa?
But it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛte saa.
There is never an end to wisdom.	Da biara nni hɔ a nyansa bɛba awiei.
And who might that be, you say.	Na hena na ebia ɛno yɛ, woka.
It was something else.	Ná ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
That was a lot of it.	Ná ɛno yɛ pii.
Get me out of here.	Yi me fi ha.
There is nothing to be done for him now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ mma no mprempren.
I have to tell you this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka saa asɛm yi kyerɛ wo.
I didn’t know.	Ná minnim.
Not today either.	Ɛnyɛ nnɛ nso.
Or it doesn’t matter.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
It was an interesting game.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a ɛyɛ anigye.
You have that right.	Wowɔ saa hokwan no.
They are both beautiful and whole.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ fɛ na wɔyɛ mũ.
I can never sleep.	Mintumi nna da.
I still have another year, so we have plenty of time.	Meda so ara wɔ afe foforo, enti yɛwɔ bere pii.
That is one product.	Ɛno yɛ ade biako a wɔde yɛ nneɛma.
Show him that you are equal to him.	Kyerɛ no sɛ wo ne no yɛ pɛ.
People are really starting to work on a story.	Nkurɔfo afi ase reyɛ asɛm bi ho adwuma ankasa.
We liked each other.	Ná yɛn ani gye yɛn ho yɛn ho ho.
Thank you, thank you.	Meda wo ase, meda wo ase.
Like now, here you are.	Te sɛ mprempren, ha ne wo.
Have a nice year.	Afe pa.
In his mind, he looked perfect.	Wɔ n’adwene mu no, na ɔte sɛ nea ɔyɛ pɛ.
In a positive way.	Wɔ ɔkwan pa so.
He can do it.	Obetumi ayɛ.
It wasn’t the best.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea eye sen biara.
Everything here was and is.	Na biribiara a ɛwɔ ha no wɔ hɔ na ɛwɔ hɔ nso.
It’s himself.	Ɛyɛ ɔno ankasa.
That didn't matter to him either.	Ná ɛno nso mfa ne ho.
Everything is set up.	Wɔde biribiara asi hɔ.
He needs to hear it from you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte fi wo hɔ.
I finally understood what you meant one day.	Awiei koraa no, metee nea wopɛ sɛ woka da bi no ase.
Only two signed up for the study.	Baanu pɛ na wɔde wɔn nsa hyɛɛ adesua no ase.
Only in the room.	Wɔ dan no mu nkutoo.
It wasn’t as bad as all that stuff.	Na ɛnyɛ bɔne te sɛ saa nneɛma no nyinaa.
Nothing exciting, really.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ anigye, ankasa.
But not for a short time.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bere tiaa bi.
This was a great one.	Ná eyi yɛ kɛse.
It had to be the job, the school.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma no, sukuu no.
But there were some ideas.	Nanso na adwene ahorow bi wɔ hɔ.
So another time.	Enti bere foforo.
This is a serious problem.	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
You can see it.	Wubetumi ahu.
This went on for a very long time.	Eyi kɔɔ so bere tenten paa.
They spent a lot of time together.	Wɔde bere pii bɔɔ mu.
It will be very beautiful.	Ɛbɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
We can’t do that.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
Another great thing to do.	Ade kɛse foforo a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Another thing to consider is this.	Ade foforo a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho ne eyi.
He was living with his mother at the time.	Saa bere no na ɔne ne maame te.
You don’t like music.	Wompɛ nnwom.
For us, just being on the road is fine.	Yɛn fam no, sɛ yɛwɔ kwan so kɛkɛ a, eye.
When he touched her, she walked towards him.	Bere a ɔde ne nsa kaa no no, ɔde ne nan kɔɔ ne nkyɛn.
More in a short time.	Pii wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
So you should never forget this.	Enti ɛnsɛ sɛ wo werɛ fi eyi da.
He was hit by a car.	Kar bi bɔɔ no.
That was pretty close to me.	Ná ɛno bɛn me yiye.
That is for the child himself.	Ɛno yɛ ma abofra no ankasa.
It just didn’t matter.	Ná ɛho nhia ara kwa.
That’s not a big deal.	Ɛno nyɛ ade kɛse.
So he’s a good boy.	Enti ɔyɛ abarimaa pa.
I hear it a lot.	Mete no pii.
In any case.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no.
Tell them that, by all means.	Ka wɔn saa, ɔkwan biara so.
I felt really used.	Metee nka sɛ wɔde adi dwuma ankasa.
There is nothing wrong with me.	Mfomso biara nni me ho.
He is there with you.	Ɔne wo wɔ hɔ.
Ability to work independently and as part of a team.	Tumi a obi tumi yɛ adwuma a ɔde ne ho na ɔyɛ kuw bi fã.
My father was there.	Ná me papa wɔ hɔ.
They were never such a plan.	Ná wɔn nyɛ nhyehyɛe a ɛte saa da.
Now it’s much easier to do.	Seesei ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse sɛ wobɛyɛ.
My current past now though.	Me mprempren bere a atwam mprempren de, nanso.
I put it together.	Mede no bɔɔ mu.
All food additives.	Nneɛma a wɔde ka aduan ho nyinaa.
We have our bad days though.	Yɛwɔ yɛn nna bɔne nanso.
There is nothing glamorous about it.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ ho.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
Whatever they do.	Nea wɔyɛ biara.
That’s the new thing.	Ɛno ne ade foforo no.
It’s a little weird.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra.
No one had that.	Obiara nni hɔ a na ɔwɔ saa.
I can handle tasks after the season.	Metumi adi nnwuma ho dwuma wɔ bere no akyi.
With one ingredient.	Wɔde nneɛma biako a wɔde yɛ nneɛma.
This obviously doesn’t work.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
It was just amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
He pointed to their words.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ wɔn nsɛm no so.
That’s not any good.	Ɛno nyɛ papa biara.
But it’s not like that anymore.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa bio.
That is certainly the case.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ saa na ɛte.
That’s probably the one you know best.	Ebia ɛno ne nea wunim no yiye sen biara.
The size doesn’t matter.	Ne kɛse no ho nhia.
I don’t like to make mistakes.	M’ani nnye ho sɛ mɛyɛ mfomso.
Our day out was underway.	Ná yɛn da a yɛde fi adi no rekɔ so.
And he shouldn’t have done that.	Na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
He never wanted to do this.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ eyi da.
How wet was the road?	Ná ɔkwan no so ayɛ nsu te dɛn?
Simple enough work, but one is extra careful.	Adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ, nanso obi hwɛ yiye kɛse.
There was nothing on it.	Ná biribiara nni so.
Take the rest of the week.	Fa dapɛn no fã a aka no.
Maybe in the townhouse.	Ebia kurow no mu fie no mu.
That means a few different things.	Ɛno kyerɛ nneɛma ahorow kakraa bi.
His words mean nothing.	Ne nsɛm no nkyerɛ hwee.
But it was expensive.	Nanso na ɛho ka yɛ den.
Many things need to be worked on.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nneɛma pii ho adwuma.
Be careful with these recipes.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ saa aduan ho nhyehyɛe ahorow yi ho.
They were human once, just a long time ago.	Na wɔyɛ nnipa bere bi, bere tenten bi a atwam ni ara kwa.
Apparently he was.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔte saa.
I can provide more details if I am interested.	Metumi de nsɛm pii ama sɛ m’ani gye ho a.
You can do this too.	Wubetumi ayɛ eyi nso.
This was a great one.	Ná eyi yɛ kɛse.
But not much though.	Nanso ɛnyɛ pii de.
My room is always warm.	Me dan mu yɛ hyew bere nyinaa.
Half the weekend feels like it’s already gone.	Dapɛn awiei no fã te nka sɛ atwam dedaw.
I have something to tell you.	Mewɔ asɛm bi a mɛka akyerɛ wo.
It was a completely new concept for me that year.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene foforo koraa ma me saa afe no.
I put the books down.	Mede nhoma ahorow no too fam.
Maybe it was an accident.	Ebia na ɛyɛ akwanhyia bi.
We can see it here with them.	Yebetumi ahu no wɔ ha ne wɔn.
His mother said he loved it.	Ne maame kae sɛ n’ani gye ho.
Another such accident happened today.	Akwanhyia foforo a ɛte saa sii nnɛ.
I'll just get on with everything.	Mede biribiara bɛkɔ so kɛkɛ.
All the days had been beautiful.	Ná nna no nyinaa ayɛ fɛ.
We are all doing much better.	Yɛn nyinaa reyɛ yiye kɛse.
It is easy to use.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
I love the dress.	M’ani gye atade no ho.
They had to be very long, indeed.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ tenten paa, ampa.
There are a few reasons why.	Nneɛma kakraa bi na enti ɛte saa.
I say, not at all.	Meka sɛ, ɛnyɛ koraa.
It’s never quite real for them.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa koraa mma wɔn da.
It might just be the perfect movie for our time.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ sini a edi mũ ama yɛn bere yi ara kwa.
Who’s in here? 	Hena na ɔwɔ ha?
It’s cold outside.	Ɛyɛ awɔw wɔ abɔnten.
The problem is that this doesn’t work.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
He lives in the city.	Ɔte kurow no mu.
This statement is false.	Saa asɛm yi yɛ atoro.
That doesn’t help anything.	Ɛno mmoa biribiara mma ɛnyɛ yiye.
He didn't know anything else either.	Ná onnim biribi foforo biara nso.
It’s not his door either.	Ɛnyɛ ne pon nso.
And I thought he really liked me.	Na misusuwii sɛ n’ani gye me ho ankasa.
He really does that.	Ɔyɛ saa ankasa.
I used to be a professional.	Kan no na meyɛ obi a onim adwuma yiye.
Thank you so much!!.	Meda wo ase pii!!.
Not by accident.	Ɛnyɛ akwanhyia mu.
And you two can do the same.	Na mo baanu nso betumi ayɛ saa.
I was very impressed with him.	M’ani gyee ne ho kɛse.
They are all money.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ sika.
These tasks can range from simple to complex.	Saa nnwuma yi betumi afi nea ɛnyɛ den so kosi nea ɛyɛ den so.
I'm one of them.	Meyɛ biako.
She would have told the police for him.	Anka ɔbɛka akyerɛ polisifo ama no.
He did a few things, but not much.	Ɔyɛɛ nneɛma kakraa bi, nanso ɛnyɛ pii.
He would do it for her.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ ama no.
We could go on for a long time.	Ná yebetumi akɔ so akyɛ.
What it really is is the present moment.	Nea ɛyɛ ankasa ne mprempren bere yi.
Probably looks the same and is half the price.	Ebia ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa ara na ne bo yɛ fã.
He has a terrible reputation.	Ɔwɔ din a ɛyɛ hu.
He did more than these things.	Ɔyɛɛ pii sen saa nneɛma yi.
He wanted to do it.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
The car was still there.	Ná kar no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
I have things to do.	Mewɔ nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
Get involved!	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu!
It’s in my nature.	Ɛwɔ me su mu.
I still had to find out what my father looked like.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meda so ara hu sɛnea me papa te.
Obviously, not everyone feels that way.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ obiara na ɔte nka saa.
I looked at him with my eyes.	Mede m’ani hwɛɛ no.
I couldn’t feel anything, either.	Na mintumi nte biribiara nka, nso.
Every year, most people agree that this is the year.	Afe biara, nnipa dodow no ara gye tom sɛ eyi ne afe.
He’s my dog.	Ɔyɛ me kraman.
It will get easier with time.	Ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw bere a bere kɔ so no.
There has to be a way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan bi wɔ hɔ.
This is the biggest problem.	Eyi ne ɔhaw kɛse no.
We could be in danger here.	Yebetumi akɔ asiane mu wɔ ha.
That is most likely the case.	Ɛda adi kɛse sɛ ɛno ne saa.
No one could touch that.	Obiara antumi mfa ne nsa nka saa asɛm no.
He knew, not me.	Ná onim, ɛnyɛ me.
I have to be here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ ha.
The same is true of us.	Saa ara na yɛn nso yɛyɛ.
Or pretty much anyone.	Anaasɛ ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara.
That’s about all he ever brought to the table, anyway.	Ɛno fa nea ɔde baa pon no so pɛn nyinaa ho, ɔkwan biara so.
The project had taken longer than he thought.	Ná adwuma no agye bere tenten sen sɛnea na osusuw.
Maybe so and maybe not.	Ebia ɛte saa na ebia ɛnte saa.
Hang out.	Kɔ, gye w’ani.
My wife is one.	Me yere yɛ biako.
Is that even possible?.	So ɛno mpo betumi ayɛ yiye?.
Who can take care of me.	Hena na obetumi ahwɛ me.
Things are as they are.	Nneɛma te sɛ nea ɛte.
But surely nothing else will.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Don’t fall behind.	Mma wo ho nkɔ akyi.
This is an old house.	Eyi yɛ ofie dedaw bi.
Take him there.	Fa no kɔ hɔ.
Therefore, there is	Enti, ɛwɔ hɔ .
Happy to talk about anything.	Anigye sɛ wobɛka biribiara ho asɛm.
But you have to put them in very deeply.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wode wɔn hyɛ mu kɔ akyiri yiye.
If it succeeds they do.	Sɛ edi yiye a wɔyɛ.
Why should it be so.	Dɛn nti na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
You were really there.	Ná wowɔ hɔ ankasa.
There is something else.	Biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
It had the face of a dog.	Ná ɛwɔ ɔkraman anim.
But the game had gone on long enough.	Nanso na agoru no akɔ so akyɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
It was in the diary.	Ná ɛwɔ da biara da nsɛm nhoma no mu.
It’s not the right way.	Ɛnyɛ ne kwan so.
You all make it look so easy.	Mo nyinaa ma ɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
But the idea is older than that.	Nanso adwene no akyɛ sen saa.
She wanted a child.	Ná ɔpɛ abofra.
I don’t know what would be best for everyone.	Minnim nea anka ɛbɛyɛ papa ama obiara.
A baby squirrel.	Ɔkraman ba bi.
Everything is interesting to us.	Biribiara ani gye yɛn ho.
And that one is obviously very wrong too.	Na ɛda adi sɛ saa biako no nso di mfomso kɛse.
Even my bed.	Me mpa mpo.
He must be free.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho.
He was suspended last year.	Wɔde no too afiase afe a etwaam no.
You obviously like him.	Ɛda adi sɛ w’ani gye ne ho.
But you have it.	Nanso wowɔ bi.
You are my son.	Wo ne me ba.
Get out of my way.	Fi me kwan so.
Or at least it might be.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
The space didn’t matter, though.	Nanso, na baabi a ɛwɔ hɔ no nyɛ hwee.
However, it may not be.	Nanso, ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
Their intentions seemed good.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔn adwene no yɛ papa.
You can’t understand it.	Worentumi nte ase.
One of them barely makes it into the room.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ne mu biako ntumi nkɔ dan no mu.
It’s fairly easy to do.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa sɛ wobɛyɛ.
This continued for the next several days.	Eyi kɔɔ so nna pii a edi hɔ no.
Pictures that resemble pictures of layout layout your home ideas.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛte sɛ mfonini ahorow no nhyehyɛe nhyehyɛe wo fie adwene ahorow.
He could tell you the situation.	Ná obetumi aka tebea no akyerɛ wo.
Just the job.	Adwuma no ara kwa.
It’s quite a problem.	Ɛyɛ ɔhaw koraa.
It’s the same information.	Ɛyɛ nsɛm koro no ara.
And yet here he is.	Na nanso ɔno na ɔwɔ ha.
I'm so happy for you.	M'ani agye paa ma wo.
But this is difficult.	Nanso eyi yɛ den.
I thought he might.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia ɔbɛyɛ saa.
As if he could blow me out of the water one day.	Te sɛ nea obetumi abɔ me wɔ nsu no mu da bi.
You have plenty of time left.	Wowɔ bere pii a aka.
The man's hair was matted.	Ná ɔbarima no ti nhwi ayɛ mmerɛw.
Not the hair.	Ɛnyɛ ti nhwi no.
This is all very strange.	Eyi nyinaa yɛ nwonwa yiye.
Only your job.	Wo adwuma nkutoo.
About two years, one week.	Bɛyɛ mfe abien, dapɛn biako.
People are working.	Nkurɔfo reyɛ adwuma.
Don't ever go '.	Mma nkɔ da '.
Which you know well.	Nea wunim no yiye.
But those days are over.	Nanso saa nna no aba awiei.
It’s just hard to join.	Ɛyɛ den ara kwa sɛ wobɛka ho.
There was no need to do so.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Many are almost impossible.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ pii ntumi nyɛ yiye.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It is not even difficult in a normal person.	Ɛnyɛ ade a ɛyɛ den mpo wɔ onipa a ɔte ase mu.
So they are put here.	Enti wɔde wɔn hyɛ ha.

Very nice and not too busy.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye na ɛnyɛ adagyew dodo.
That boy knows exactly what he is doing.	Saa abarimaa no nim nea ɔreyɛ no yiye.
If only he knew what it was.	Sɛ na onim nea ɛyɛ a.
This was important for two reasons.	Nneɛma abien nti na na eyi ho hia.
The importance of filling.	Hia a ɛho hia sɛ wɔde ahyɛ mu ma.
Check out the full details here.	Hwɛ nsɛm no nyinaa wɔ ha.
It’s midnight.	Ɛyɛ anadwo fã.
You can even come with me.	Wubetumi mpo ne me aba.
It is important for everyone to understand each other.	Ɛho hia sɛ obiara te ne ho ase.
He just wanted it to be the two of them.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wɔn baanu no ara kwa.
None of him is here.	Ɔno mu biara nni ha.
Water conditions mean danger on the road.	Nsu tebea kyerɛ asiane wɔ kwan so.
This is a remarkable statement.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛte saa.
These people were with him.	Ná saa nkurɔfo yi ka ne ho.
Don’t drive too fast!	Mma kar nkɔ ntɛmntɛm dodo!
There are no animals here.	Mmoa biara nte ha.
Neither he, nor they, have any power in the situation.	Mma no, anaa wɔn, tumi biara wɔ tebea no mu.
I understand, but no one can help.	Mete ase, nanso obiara ntumi mmoa.
And yet, it still happens to me.	Na nanso, ɛda so ara to me.
Just feel it.	Te nka ara kwa.
The whole town seemed excited.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea kurow no nyinaa ani agye.
I never knew any of their real names.	Ná minnim wɔn din ankasa biara da.
For us, this is a must.	Yɛn fam no, eyi yɛ ade a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
He knew nothing about it.	Ná onnim ho hwee.
You may even know who he is.	Ebia wunim onipa a ɔyɛ no mpo.
I find that very strange.	Mihu sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa yiye.
There are only a few of them.	Wɔn mu kakraa bi pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
He was in better shape than this.	Ná ɔwɔ tebea pa mu sen eyi.
We are involved in a wide range of projects.	Yɛde yɛn ho hyɛ nnwuma ahorow pii mu.
The first three were assignments.	Ná abiɛsa a edi kan no yɛ adwuma a wɔde maa wɔn.
It’s a complete lie.	Ɛyɛ atoro koraa.
And it works extremely well.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
He liked to do his part.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ne fam de.
I hope it was good for you too.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ na eye maa wo nso.
I had known him for a number of years.	Ná minim no mfe dodow bi ni.
But that is not the case here.	Nanso ɛnte saa wɔ ha.
They all use that approach.	Wɔn nyinaa de saa kwan no di dwuma.
And maybe we do.	Na ebia yɛyɛ saa.
In front of pipes.	Wɔ nsu a wɔde fa nsu mu anim.
Consider all the possibilities.	Susuw nneɛma a wubetumi ayɛ nyinaa ho.
It’s a good day for him.	Ɛyɛ da pa ma no.
Not this time around.	Ɛnyɛ saa bere yi de.
Not that he thought it would.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na osusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I want more things that do that for her.	Mepɛ nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ saa ma no.
If they do, it’s great.	Sɛ wɔyɛ saa a, ɛyɛ kɛse.
I don’t think it’s easy.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
He did the same thing over and over again.	Ɔyɛɛ ade koro no ara mpɛn pii.
I have a headache.	Mewɔ ti a ɛyɛ yaw.
Everyone would nod in some way.	Na obiara bɛbɔ ne ti ase wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
And every reason to do so.	Na biribiara a enti ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
He knew that.	Ná onim saa.
And he was in pain.	Na na ɔte yaw.
He lives somewhere else.	Ɔte baabi foforo.
But that’s not the end of the story.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no awiei.
It's all about presentation.	Ne nyinaa fa nsɛm a wɔka kyerɛ ho.
Once again, they were very interested.	Saa bere yi nso, na wɔn ani gye ho kɛse.
Without water, life is impossible.	Sɛ nsu nni hɔ a, nkwa ntumi nyɛ yiye.
And everyone else who can get it.	Na obiara a aka a obetumi anya no nso.
Sleep on it.	Da wɔ so.
He couldn't do anything about it either	Ɔno nso antumi anyɛ ho hwee .
There are so many people, such a nice car.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ, kar a ɛyɛ fɛ saa.
I’m happy to be here.	M’ani agye sɛ mewɔ ha.
It was what someone would do.	Ná ɛyɛ nea obi bɛyɛ.
People start making plans for the next couple of days.	Nkurɔfo fi ase yɛ nhyehyɛe ma nna abien a edi hɔ no.
But it’s not his eyes.	Nanso ɛnyɛ n’ani.
He was put on the job.	Wɔde no sii adwuma no so.
It’s still painful.	Ɛda so ara yɛ yaw.
There are so many more!	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ bio!
Some policies have been introduced.	Wɔde nhyehyɛe ahorow bi aba.
That’s his problem, not mine.	Ɛno ne ne haw, ɛnyɛ me haw no.
He just really, really doesn’t care.	Ɔno kɛkɛ ankasa, ankasa mfa ne ho.
One day just followed another, one day like another entirely.	Da koro bi dii foforo akyi ara kwa, da koro bi te sɛ foforo koraa.
Funding for schools.	Sika a wɔde ma sukuu ahorow.
They put power in our power.	Wɔde tumi hyɛ yɛn tumi mu.
But you shouldn’t rely on this.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ wode wo ho to eyi so.
I knew it was true.	Ná minim sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
Some days are like that.	Nna bi te saa.
So much has happened in the past few days.	Enti nneɛma pii asi wɔ nna kakraa a atwam no mu.
It is not consumption.	Ɛnyɛ nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma.
And it wasn’t even my idea.	Na ɛnyɛ m’adwene mpo.
I can’t lie to him.	Mintumi nni atoro nkyerɛ no.
And he had done so.	Na na wayɛ saa.
So that was really exciting.	Enti na ɛno yɛ anigye ankasa.
Most of their debts were in this very city.	Ná wɔde wɔn ka dodow no ara wɔ kurow yi ara mu.
Whose idea was this?	Ná eyi yɛ hena adwene?
Just a lot of variety of everything.	Biribiara ahorow pii ara kwa.
I really think about it.	Misusuw ho ankasa.
His excuse is not good.	Nea ɔde yi ne ho ano no nyɛ papa.
Evening fell.	Anwummere hwee ase.
I would love it if you could do this every day.	M’ani begye ho sɛ wubetumi ayɛ eyi da biara da a.
Please can someone point me in the right direction.	Mesrɛ sɛ obi betumi akyerɛ me kwan pa.
There are some things that are hard to do.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ.
The child asked for more.	Abofra no bisaa pii.
It didn’t do anything for him.	Anyɛ hwee amma no.
We are completely ourselves.	Yɛyɛ yɛn ankasa koraa.
Use it wisely.	Fa di dwuma yiye.
It could easily be the truth.	Ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nokware no.
Clearly, it is not.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
However, this is not so surprising.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ nwonwa saa.
Someone hit us.	Obi bɔɔ yɛn ho hwee.
I need to see you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu wo.
This new book is very expensive.	Saa nhoma foforo yi bo yɛ den yiye.
Give him a shot.	Ma no tuo.
Take your turn away.	Fa wo dan kɔ.
There were so many things he wanted to tell her.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ no.
It’s hard for him.	Ɛyɛ den ma no.
That’s with him there.	Ɛno ne no wɔ hɔ.
That says a lot.	Ɛno ka pii.
I wish it wasn’t.	Me yam a anka ɛnte saa.
We really, really liked them.	Yɛn ani gyee wɔn ho ankasa, ankasa.
His letter came too late.	Ne krataa no baa akyiri dodo.
It was much worse.	Ná ɛyɛ bɔne sen saa koraa.
A plan of action.	Nhyehyɛe bi a wɔde bɛyɛ ade.
You have to do it though, for all of us.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no nanso, ma yɛn nyinaa.
Something here is not quite right.	Biribi a ɛwɔ ha no nyɛ nokware koraa.
Also difficult issues.	Nsɛm a ɛyɛ den nso.
Just be careful.	Hwɛ yiye nkutoo.
Check out what they do.	Hwɛ nea wɔyɛ.
But we are just friends.	Nanso yɛyɛ nnamfo ara kwa.
I'm on the road.	Mewɔ kwan so.
I can’t say enough good things about them.	Mintumi nka nsɛm pa a ɛdɔɔso mfa wɔn ho.
I know too many things.	Minim nneɛma pii dodo.
It might even be better for him and everyone else.	Ebia na ɛbɛyɛ papa mpo ama ɔne obiara.
Nor do humans.	Saa ara na nnipa nso nyɛ saa.
He is such a wonderful kid.	Ɔyɛ abofra a ɔyɛ nwonwa saa.
Don’t show me a false face.	Mma atoro anim nkyerɛ me.
This is perhaps the most surprising thing.	Ebia eyi ne ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen biara.
His wife came up to him and winked at him.	Ne yere baa ne nkyɛn na ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
That is not our case.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn asɛm no te saa.
It is to touch the whole group.	Ɛyɛ sɛ wɔka kuw no nyinaa.
I really wanted to do it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ no ankasa.
His wife was with him.	Ná ne yere ka ne ho.
This is not entirely true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
We would do anything for you.	Anka yɛbɛyɛ biribiara ama wo.
And you can.	Na wubetumi.
They are very happy.	Wɔn ani agye yiye.
My mother used to sing this song.	Ná me maame taa to dwom yi.
He could almost sign his name.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na obetumi de ne nsa ahyɛ ne din ase.
But he had much to say first.	Nanso na ɔwɔ nsɛm pii a ɔbɛka kan.
All in all, it was a wonderful thing.	Ne nyinaa mu no, na ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
We finally get involved.	Yɛn awiei koraa no, wɔde yɛn ho hyɛ mu.
Everything had been fine a few hours earlier.	Ná biribiara ayɛ yiye nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi a atwam ni.
I could go there with them.	Ná metumi ne wɔn akɔ hɔ.
If you had an idea.	Sɛ na wowɔ adwene bi a.
The car was fine.	Kar no yɛɛ yiye.
If he can share it, we would appreciate it.	Sɛ obetumi akyɛ a, yɛn ani begye ho.
I usually had only a few hours to get things done.	Mpɛn pii no, na mewɔ nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi pɛ a mede bɛyɛ nneɛma.
One bad moment.	Bere bɔne biako.
He was in a terrible state.	Ná ɔwɔ tebea a ɛyɛ hu mu.
His wolf-like eyes are squinting at him.	N’ani a ɛte sɛ ɔkraman no rebɔ no.
My room could fit yours.	Ná me dan no betumi ahyɛ wo de no mu.
But he is amazing.	Nanso ɔyɛ nwonwa.
What was it like before?	Ná ɛte dɛn kan no?
It’s up to me to save myself.	Ɛyɛ me na ɛsɛ sɛ migye me ho nkwa.
Those things are pretty cool.	Saa nneɛma no yɛ fɛ yiye.
The next year didn’t go well.	Afe a edi hɔ no ankɔ yiye.
You can do anything.	Wo tumi yɛ biribiara.
I know how he works.	Minim sɛnea ɔyɛ adwuma.
This is the free version.	Eyi yɛ nea wɔde di dwuma kwa no.
He patted his head.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne ti so.
The car struck the animal.	Kar no bɔɔ aboa no.
You can’t do anything either.	Worentumi nyɛ hwee nso.
It’s much worse than that.	Ɛyɛ bɔne sen saa koraa.
In time, we enjoyed it.	Bere kɔɔ so no, yɛn ani gyee ho.
But he couldn't do anything himself.	Nanso na ɔno ankasa antumi anyɛ biara.
He didn't know what to say.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛka.
We are stronger than this.	Yɛyɛ den sen eyi.
I was sitting in a trailer.	Ná mete kar bi a wɔde fa kar mu mu.
I think this was the default setting as well.	Misusuw sɛ na eyi ne nhyehyɛe a wɔde ahyɛ mu no nso.
He tells me every day.	Ɔka kyerɛ me da biara da.
You just can’t do both.	Worentumi nyɛ abien no nyinaa kɛkɛ.
This is an old problem.	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw dedaw bi.
The evening's work took a long time.	Anwummere no adwuma no gyee bere tenten.
They both love it here.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa ani gye ho wɔ ha.
What a joy it is.	Anigye bɛn ara ni.
Use it to do what you want.	Fa yɛ nea wopɛ.
This dress is everything.	Saa atade yi yɛ biribiara.
He was too weak to get out of bed.	Ná wayɛ mmerɛw dodo sɛ obetumi afi mpa so.
I am very involved with them.	Mede me ho ahyɛ wɔn mu yiye.
Something is going on here.	Biribi rekɔ so wɔ ha.
He was always happy to help.	Ná n’ani gye bere nyinaa sɛ ɔbɛboa.
The project sounds very interesting.	Adwuma no te sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
He thinks you are alone.	Osusuw sɛ wo nkutoo na wowɔ hɔ.
Boy, it’s late.	Abarimaa, ɛyɛ akyiri.
This is not his fault at all.	Eyi nyɛ ne mfomso koraa.
I can't take it.	Mintumi mfa.
Many people work from home these days.	Nnipa pii yɛ adwuma wɔ fie nnansa yi.
I look like myself without any clothes.	Me te sɛ me ho a minni atade biara.
I put my hand on his.	Mede me nsa too ne de no so.
The house looks amazing.	Ofie no hwɛ yɛ nwonwa.
You knew me.	Ná wunim me.
More information may be coming soon.	Ebia nsɛm pii bɛba nnansa yi ara.
I had no business hanging out with him.	Ná minni adwuma biara sɛ me ne no bɛbɔ.
She is said to be beautiful.	Wɔka sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
The manufacturer said that it was safe.	Nea ɔyɛɛ no ​​kae sɛ asiane biara nni ho.
Something was going on outside.	Ná biribi rekɔ so wɔ abɔnten.
Even more interesting are the animations.	Nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse mpo ne mfonini ahorow a wɔde yɛ mfonini no.
I can set them firmly.	Metumi de wɔn asi hɔ denneennen.
He was a nuisance, in a way.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔhaw, ɔkwan bi so.
The car fell on top of it.	Kar no hwee ase wɔ so.
Doing something is okay.	Biribi a wobɛyɛ no nyɛ hwee.
It shouldn’t be this scary.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ hu yi.
I only made two so far.	Meyɛɛ abien pɛ de besi saa bere yi.
He was better than good.	Na ɔyɛ papa sen papa.
No wonder I was at the bottom.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ na mewɔ ase hɔ.
So, no more of that here.	Enti, ɛnyɛ ɛno bio wɔ ha.
Everyone has a story.	Obiara wɔ asɛm bi.
Truth exists only when thought ends.	Bere a adwene ba awiei nkutoo na nokware wɔ hɔ.
All of you, all of you are equal.	Mo nyinaa, mo nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
But look at everything that has happened.	Nanso hwɛ biribiara a asi.
His hands.	Ne nsa.
Thank you for being here with me for a little while tonight.	Meda wo ase sɛ wo ne me wɔ ha kakra anadwo yi.
He didn't know what it was but he knew it was terrible.	Na onnim nea ɛyɛ nanso na onim sɛ ɛyɛ hu.
One must keep living.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi kɔ so tra ase.
The project was a success.	Adwuma no dii yiye.
That was all he could do.	Ná ɛno ara ne nea obetumi ayɛ.
This was a moment of hope.	Ná eyi yɛ anidaso bere tiaa bi.
However, this is not the case.	Nanso, eyi nte saa.
We still need to work on the language.	Ɛda so ara hia sɛ yɛyɛ kasa no ho adwuma.
I hope you feel better soon.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo ho bɛtɔ wo ntɛm.
This was a great sin for him.	Ná eyi yɛ bɔne kɛse ma no.
He set the table.	Ɔde pon no sii hɔ.
I'm not even all that nice.	Menyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ saa nyinaa mpo.
Or whatever they are.	Anaasɛ nea wɔyɛ biara.
Not to mention that.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔbɛka saa asɛm no ho asɛm.
I think you see where this is going.	Misusuw sɛ wuhu baabi a eyi rekɔ.
Certainly not his.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ ne de.
He could go in, if he wanted to.	Ná obetumi akɔ mu, sɛ ɔpɛ a.
Their numbers are nothing.	Wɔn dodow yɛ hwee.
There was a plan.	Ná nhyehyɛe bi wɔ hɔ.
Not when he had touched her again.	Ɛnyɛ bere a na ɔde ne nsa aka no bio no.
But this never.	Nanso eyi da.
The dress is new.	Atade no yɛ foforo.
Something interesting is happening.	Biribi a ɛyɛ anigye rekɔ so.
Food is served to someone.	Aduan a wɔde ma obi.
That’s right, another one.	Ɛte saa, foforo nso.
It is not necessary to solve the problem.	Ɛho nhia na wode adi ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
Nothing to really tell them.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka kyerɛ wɔn ankasa.
At least not in the short term.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ bere tiaa mu.
Most of it is nothing interesting.	Ne mu dodow no ara nyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ anigye.
A language problem perhaps.	Kasa ho haw bi ebia.
It’s not just that he’s not interested.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔnyɛ obi a n’ani nnye ho kɛkɛ.
Again, this was not new information.	Bio nso, na eyi nyɛ nsɛm foforo.
And there was a lot of it.	Na na ɛwɔ hɔ pii.
I would feel better now.	Anka me ho bɛtɔ me mprempren.
None of them except you.	Wɔn mu biara gye wo nkutoo.
But he didn’t want to talk about it that day.	Nanso na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka ho asɛm saa da no.
It didn’t look good last night, you know.	Ɛnte sɛ nea eye anadwo a etwaam no, wunim.
That was certainly the case for me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛte saa wɔ me fam.
Think of it as a matter of you and food.	Fa no sɛ ɛyɛ wo ne aduan ho asɛm.
I believe that is the ultimate test.	Migye di sɛ ɛno ne sɔhwɛ a etwa to.
Telephones were scarce in those days.	Ná telefon ho yɛ na saa bere no.
It’s me for him.	Ɛyɛ me ma no.
It was a long time ago.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
This year there is something surprising.	Afe yi biribi wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He put me in a job.	Ɔde me sii adwuma bi mu.
Many continue to do so.	Pii kɔ so yɛ saa.
He did, you know.	Ɔyɛɛ saa, wunim.
Everything else did.	Biribiara a aka no yɛɛ saa.
Take a quick look at each of them .	Hwɛ wɔn mu biara ntɛm ara .
However, this was not the case.	Nanso, na eyi nte saa.
I had a wonderful time with you.	Me ne wo nyaa bere a ɛyɛ anigye.
This may be their own home, his and hers.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ wɔn ankasa fie, ne de ne ne de.
Maybe he thought you were hot.	Ebia na osusuw sɛ wo ho yɛ hyew.
It will be here.	Ɛbɛyɛ ha.
And that’s not easy either.	Na ɛno nso nyɛ mmerɛw.
Which water is the strongest?	Nsu bɛn na ano yɛ den sen biara?
His mother didn’t want me to do it.	Ná ne maame mpɛ sɛ meyɛ.
That’s how people like us go.	Saa na nnipa te sɛ yɛn fa so.
But he’s not really that busy.	Nanso ɔnyɛ obi a onni adagyew saa ankasa.
I feel your pain.	Mete wo yaw no nka.
I am sure he will do well.	Migye di sɛ ɔbɛyɛ yiye.
Can anyone guide me.	So obi betumi akyerɛ me kwan.
The city impressed me with its beauty.	Kurow no maa m’ani gyee sɛnea na ɛyɛ fɛ no ho.
He wasn’t even my father.	Ná ɔnyɛ me papa mpo.
But that was not the case here.	Nanso na ɛnte saa wɔ ha.
I really like the movie.	M’ani gye sini no ho ankasa.
Walk out of school.	Nantew fi sukuu mu.
I agree with him.	Me ne no yɛ adwene.
And it still came to him.	Na ɛda so ara baa ne so.
He could have done any good after all.	Anka obetumi ayɛ papa biara akyi.
So, this means that there is no error.	Enti, eyi kyerɛ sɛ mfomso biara nni hɔ.
I really believed that, too, too.	Migye dii saa ankasa, nso, nso.
He was an honest boy.	Ná ɔyɛ abarimaa a ɔka nokware.
I look after them as if they were my children.	Mehwɛ wɔn te sɛ nea wɔyɛ me mma.
Check out the book to see the project.	Hwɛ nhoma no na wopɛ sɛ wuhu adwuma no.
I would go to them later.	Anka mɛkɔ wɔn nkyɛn akyiri yi.
Not for the most part.	Ɛnyɛ ne fã kɛse no ara.
All the things you told us were lies.	Nneɛma a woka kyerɛɛ yɛn no nyinaa yɛ atoro.
Review your comments and posts.	Hwɛ wo nsɛm ne wo nsɛm a wode ahyɛ mu no mu.
He knew that man.	Ná onim saa ɔbarima no.
Everything looked brand new.	Na biribiara hwɛ sɛ ɛyɛ foforo koraa.
The man struck her.	Ɔbarima no bɔɔ no.
I hope people like it.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ nkurɔfo ani begye ho.
And whatever happiness we can have.	Na anigye biara a yebetumi anya.
Nothing in him yet.	Biribiara nni ne mu de besi nnɛ.
This is not surprising.	Eyi nyɛ nwonwa.
The movie comes out next week.	Sini no bɛba dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
Everything was going well.	Ná biribiara rekɔ yiye.
Only for a short time.	Bere tiaa bi pɛ.
And this will be true.	Na eyi bɛyɛ nokware.
Many problems.	Ɔhaw ahorow pii.
This was all just words, only words.	Ná eyi nyinaa yɛ nsɛm ara kwa, nsɛm nkutoo.
It should be me thanking you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ me na meda wo ase.
Once upon a time they did.	Bere bi na wɔyɛ saa.
Is he an innovator? 	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ nneɛma foforo?
nothing else in any of its design details.	biribi foforo biara nni ne nhyehyɛe ho nsɛm biara mu.
Just two simple people.	Nnipa baanu a wɔn ho nyɛ den pɛ.
He wanted her, and alone.	Ná ɔpɛ no, na ɔno nkutoo.
I nodded my head at him.	Mede me ti too fam kyerɛɛ no.
Let him out, let him out!	Ma no mfi adi, ma no mfi adi!
I want people to understand the story behind it.	Mepɛ sɛ nkurɔfo te asɛm a ɛwɔ akyi no ase.
Might be good for the book though.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa ama nhoma no de, nanso.
I saw him in his room this morning.	Mihuu no wɔ ne dan mu anɔpa yi.
I really like the look of his room.	M'ani gye sɛnea ne dan no ho yiye.
There are many reasons why we do so.	Nneɛma pii nti na yɛyɛ saa a, ɛyɛ anigye.
I couldn’t believe this was what people thought of me.	Na mintumi nnye nni sɛ eyi ne nea nkurɔfo susuw wɔ me ho.
He gave her a smile.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ no.
Why do I need to do this?	Dɛn nti na ɛho hia sɛ meyɛ eyi?
That’s a lot of time.	Ɛno yɛ bere pii.
The news shocked many.	Asɛm no maa nnipa pii ho dwiriw wɔn.
But that power comes at a price.	Nanso saa tumi no de bo bi ba.
There are many reasons why.	Nneɛma pii nti na ɛnte saa.
That’s not very exciting.	Ɛno nyɛ anigye kɛse.
I should have done that.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
So stay alive.	Enti tra ase.
I don’t know what that’s all about.	Minnim nea ɛno nyinaa fa ho.
These shoes are made from real leather.	Wɔde aboa nhoma ankasa na ɛyɛ mpaboa yi.
But there was hope.	Nanso na anidaso wɔ hɔ.
And he wanted to make the most of it.	Na na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde bedi dwuma yiye.
You have done very well.	Woayɛ no yiye paa.
As he had done before.	Sɛnea na wayɛ pɛn no.
There is too much of it.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛdɔɔso dodo.
However, we humans continue to do it.	Nanso, yɛn a yɛyɛ nnipa no kɔ so yɛ.
Speak a little.	Kasa kakra.
All that stuff is just wrong wrong wrong.	Saa nneɛma no nyinaa yɛ mfomso ara kwa mfomso mfomso.
This is our home back here.	Eyi ne yɛn fie wɔ ha akyi.
Some other time.	Bere foforo bi.
But it feels good to me.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea eye ma me.
I think you need to think this through.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw eyi ho yiye.
Is it still there?	So ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ?
That’s not why we’re here.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno nti na yɛwɔ ha no.
I couldn’t do anything.	Ná mintumi nyɛ hwee.
And that’s what it is.	Na ɛno ne saa.
He seems quite similar.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔte sɛ no koraa.
But it’s all my fault.	Nanso ne nyinaa yɛ me mfomso.
Who would have made us.	Hena na anka ɔbɛyɛ yɛn.
If someone can find it you can.	Sɛ obi betumi ahu no a wubetumi.
I felt really bad.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ bɔne ankasa.
Everyone really.	Obiara ankasa.
I am in this case.	Me wɔ saa asɛm yi mu.
Back to work.	San kɔ adwuma mu.
Fortunately, they do.	Nea eye ne sɛ, wɔde ma.
Or tomorrow.	Anaasɛ ɔkyena.
The situation worsened over the years.	Tebea no mu yɛɛ den wɔ mfe pii mu.
I am on the wrong path.	Mewɔ ɔkwan bɔne so.
He headed for the door.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ɔpon no ano.
Feel these songs.	Te nnwom yi nka.
The man needed a drink.	Ná ɔbarima no hia nsa.
Big and strong.	Kɛse na ɛyɛ den.
It is as soft as water.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ nsu.
She was attracted to the man.	N’ani gyee ɔbarima no ho.
But it’s not just the reason.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea enti a ɛte saa ara kɛkɛ.
So you see the final add-on.	Enti wuhu asɛm a wɔde ka ho a etwa to no.
This time, no one can.	Saa bere yi de, obiara ntumi.
However, nothing seemed to be able to do that.	Nanso, na ɛte sɛ nea biribiara ntumi nyɛ saa.
But he knew that.	Nanso na onim saa.
The water was boiling hot.	Ná nsu no rebɔ hyew.
At least that’s how the story goes.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na asɛm no kɔ.
There are only three things, really.	Nneɛma abiɛsa pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ, ampa.
The coat was soft and made of leather.	Ná atade no yɛ mmerɛw na na aboa nhoma ayɛ.
He thought he was unwise.	Ná osusuw sɛ onni nyansa.
Let someone else tell him.	Ma obi foforo nka nkyerɛ no.
Don’t tell them anything.	Nka asɛm biara nkyerɛ wɔn.
That makes it difficult.	Ɛno ma ɛyɛ den.
We use it in almost every industry.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ yɛde di dwuma wɔ adwuma biara mu.
I was one of them.	Ná meyɛ biako.
The house itself appears to be in good shape.	Ɛte sɛ nea ofie no ankasa wɔ tebea pa mu.
I have absolutely no idea how these kids felt.	Minni sɛnea mmofra yi tee nka no ho adwene biara koraa.
He painted it for years.	Ɔde mfe pii yɛɛ ne mfonini.
It doesn’t surprise me.	Ɛnyɛ me nwonwa.
According to most, that is.	Sɛnea dodow no ara kyerɛ no, ɛno ne.
That’s his words.	Ɛno ne ne nsɛm.
But that’s not the end of the story for him.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no awiei mma no.
Nothing seemed immediately appealing.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye ntɛm ara.
This is a very important point.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛho hia kɛse.
This didn’t work for me.	Eyi anyɛ yiye amma me.
I don’t really know that much about him.	Minnim ne ho nsɛm pii saa ankasa.
There were no children.	Na mma biara nni hɔ.
Forget about the cars.	Wo werɛ mfi kar ahorow no ho asɛm.
I stay at home with them.	Me ne wɔn tra fie.
Can that car go faster?	So saa kar no betumi akɔ ntɛmntɛm?
It was cold.	Ná awɔw wom.
I was just his wife before.	Ná meyɛ ne yere ara kwa kan.
That was the problem with my mother.	Na ɛno ne ɔhaw no wɔ me maame fam.
A terrible accident happened.	Akwanhyia a ɛyɛ hu bi sii.
Never tell him he’s too good for you.	Nka nkyerɛ no da sɛ ɔyɛ papa dodo ma wo.
He was sleeping.	Ná ɔyɛ nna.
You forget about it tonight.	Wo werɛ fi no anadwo yi.
I had two hands.	Ná mewɔ nsa abien.
I would be a good one, though.	Nanso, anka mɛyɛ obi a eye.
But it was also someone else’s.	Nanso na ɛyɛ obi foforo nso de.
The road was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ kwan no so ma.
Not so much anymore.	Ɛnyɛ pii saa bio.
I love this house.	M’ani gye ofie yi ho.
This is who you want to be.	Eyi ne wo a wopɛ sɛ woyɛ no.
He was in enough danger.	Ná ɔwɔ asiane a ɛdɔɔso mu.
That’s the reason why.	Ɛno ne ɛno nti.
He knows we are here.	Onim sɛ yɛwɔ ha.
Or even the day before.	Anaasɛ da a edi kan no mpo.
That was the big thing for us this week.	Ɛno ne ade kɛse a na ɛwɔ hɔ ma yɛn dapɛn yi.
A time of use.	Bere bi a wɔde di dwuma.
You had done well.	Ná woayɛ no yiye.
There must be a reason you don’t know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ade bi nti a wunnim ne sɛ.
The entire performance is held in one afternoon.	Wɔde agoru no nyinaa yɛ awia biako pɛ.
There is a better way.	Ɔkwan a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ.
Currently there are two issues.	Mprempren nsɛm abien na ɛwɔ hɔ.
And she had been very good to her children.	Na na wayɛ ne mma no yiye paa.
On the man.	Wɔ ɔbarima no so.
He could do better.	Ná obetumi ayɛ nea eye sen saa.
Where the mind goes, the story follows.	Baabi a adwene no kɔ no, asɛm no di akyi.
The very first day.	Da a edi kan koraa no.
They don’t like anyone but themselves.	Wɔn ani nnye obiara ho gye wɔn ankasa.
Unless he is a human being.	Gye sɛ ɔyɛ onipa.
These past few days were very exciting.	Ná nna kakraa a atwam yi yɛ anigye kɛse.
You must have put a lot of work into this.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ woayɛ adwuma pii de ayɛ eyi.
When you know something well, it’s almost always easier.	Sɛ wunim biribi yiye a, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw bere nyinaa.
Human life is human life.	Onipa nkwa yɛ onipa nkwa.
Maybe it’s a good idea.	Ebia ɛyɛ adwene pa.
It’s working time.	Ɛyɛ adwuma bere.
Do not use in old or new projects.	Mfa nni dwuma wɔ nnwuma dedaw anaa foforo mu.
Be a man about it.	Yɛ ɔbarima wɔ ho.
Some characteristics of the two systems will be similar.	Nhyehyɛe abien no su ahorow bi bɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ pɛ.
But it is too late.	Nanso aka akyi dodo.
Not quite as tall as me.	Ɛnyɛ tenten te sɛ me koraa.
Two and a half days.	Nna abien ne fã.
It looked like an evil face,.	Na ɛte sɛ anim bɔne,.
Look at this work of mine.	Hwɛ me adwuma yi.
He had power.	Ná ɔwɔ tumi.
Not for the money.	Ɛnyɛ sika nti.
Include three photos of your choice.	Fa mfonini abiɛsa a wopɛ ka ho.
However, I don’t.	Nanso, menyɛ saa.
That night,	Anadwo no, .
I had no idea who or where to go.	Ná minnim onii anaa baabi a mɛkɔ.
I didn’t want this.	Ná mempɛ eyi.
Only one time use.	Bere biako pɛ a wɔde di dwuma.
Maybe he would say my name.	Ebia na ɔbɛka me din.
None of them are as happy as you are.	Wɔn mu biara nni hɔ a n’ani gye te sɛ wo.
That movie ended.	Saa sini no baa awiei.
He was a strong man.	Ná ne ho yɛ den.
He must have known.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na onim.
The child's recovery was remarkable.	Sɛnea abofra no ho tɔɔ no no yɛɛ nwonwa.
And it’s quite complicated.	Na ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den koraa.
The first year of the.	Afe a edi kan no.
So, it’s like that.	Enti, ɛte saa.
But some problems remain.	Nanso ɔhaw ahorow bi da so ara wɔ hɔ.
My apartment is set up in a really wonderful way.	Wɔde me dan no asi hɔ wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa so.
But this article lacks some important information.	Nanso saa asɛm yi ntumi nnya nsɛm bi a ɛho hia.
He knew exactly what that meant.	Ná onim nea ɛno kyerɛ yiye.
She did look like herself, like herself.	Ná ɔte sɛ ɔno ankasa ampa, na ɔte sɛ ɔno ankasa.
I felt like me again.	Metee nka bio sɛ ​​me.
Not every idea is good.	Ɛnyɛ adwene biara na ɛyɛ papa.
They shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Not on him.	Ɛnyɛ ɔno so.
I never knew what.	Na minnim dɛn da.
Maybe not all of it.	Ebia ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa.
You might be surprised!.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ wo nwonwa!.
I can give you their names.	Metumi de wɔn din ama mo.
Three years is a short time.	Mfe abiɛsa yɛ bere tiaa bi.
I don’t like them anymore.	M’ani nnye wɔn ho bio.
All the stuff is always there.	Nneɛma no nyinaa wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
Put on your nicest shoes.	Hyɛ wo mpaboa a ɛyɛ fɛ sen biara.
I like those too.	M’ani gye saa nneɛma no nso ho.
Nothing must be as impossible as anything.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ biribiara nni hɔ te sɛ nea biribiara ntumi nyɛ no.
I had to do something about it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ho biribi.
Everything was fine.	Na biribiara yɛ yiye.
All that money.	Saa sika no nyinaa.
This can go a long way.	Eyi betumi akɔ nneɛma pii so.
I think it’s important, too.	Misusuw sɛ ɛho hia, nso.
We must conclude this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde eyi ba awiei.
It’s a leg.	Ɛyɛ nan.
Two books lie on the table.	Nhoma abien da pon no so.
No one wanted to talk to him.	Ná obiara nni hɔ a ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne no kasa.
There is only one girl he wants to talk to anyway.	Abeawa biako pɛ na ɔwɔ hɔ a ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne no kasa ɔkwan biara so.
But it still doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛda so ara nyɛ asɛm.
The accident happened during rush hour.	Akwanhyia no sii wɔ bere a nnipa pii kɔ hɔ no mu.
I know, I do, too.	Minim, me nso.
He had told me so himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa aka saa akyerɛ me.
What is your favorite food?	Aduan bɛn na w’ani gye ho?
I don’t like this.	M’ani nnye eyi ho.
There would be no language.	Anka kasa biara nni hɔ.
I can’t take this anymore.	Mintumi nnye eyi bio.
If anyone can, it’s you.	Sɛ obi betumi a, ɛyɛ wo.
I never really worked with him.	Me ne no anyɛ adwuma ankasa da.
I know a lot of people who use it.	Minim nnipa pii a wɔde di dwuma.
He hung up the phone.	Ɔde telefon no bɔɔ mu.
Doing some work for you.	Adwuma bi a wobɛyɛ ama wo.
It was very beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
All schools need textbooks.	Sukuu ahorow nyinaa hia adesua nhoma ahorow.
And stay alive.	Na tra ase.
He lives nearby.	Ɔte bɛn hɔ.
Maybe there was something he could see.	Ebia na biribi wɔ hɔ a obetumi ahu.
It’s a fun job.	Ɛyɛ anigye adwuma.
Like he just had to touch her.	Te sɛ nea na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka no ara kwa.
Half of the group is gone now.	Kuw no mu fã nni hɔ bio mprempren.
This is easy.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw.
Or something else entirely.	Anaasɛ biribi foforo koraa.
Only most of the house.	Ofie dodow no ara nkutoo.
You are in over your head here.	Wowɔ mu wɔ wo ti so wɔ ha.
We had parties every weekend.	Ná yɛyɛ apontow ahorow dapɛn awiei biara.
In this case, not much at all.	Wɔ eyi mu no, ɛnyɛ pii koraa.
He had no water.	Ná onni nsu biara.
I use it very sparingly.	Mede di dwuma kakraa bi koraa.
But that would be a whole other story.	Nanso ɛno bɛyɛ asɛm foforo koraa.
I saw someone.	Mihuu obi.
It’s just going to happen.	Ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
But there is still much to be done.	Nanso pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Everyone else knows them.	Obiara a aka no nim wɔn.
Even this doesn’t tell the whole story.	Eyi mpo nka asɛm no nyinaa.
I’ve been interested in this for a while.	M’ani agye eyi so bere tiaa bi.
He told me later.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me akyiri yi.
It was a terrible night.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo a ɛyɛ hu.
I couldn’t take in how big the house was.	Ná mintumi nnye sɛnea ofie no kɛse te.
He glanced out the window.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
Considerations for your design.	Nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho ma wo nhyehyɛe no.
Maybe it wasn’t good news.	Ebia na ɛnyɛ nsɛm pa.
This does not seem to be the case.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi nte saa.
It’s just a matter of quantity.	Ɛyɛ dodow a wɔde bɛma no ara kwa.
He needs to work on the latter.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ asɛm a etwa to no ho adwuma.
We need to do something about it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi.
The Word was not very interesting to him.	Ná Asɛm no nyɛ anigye kɛse mma no.
Money isn’t everything, you know.	Sika nyɛ biribiara, wunim.
Me, thank you.	Me, meda wo ase.
I just didn't know how to do this.	Ná minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ eyi ara kwa.
Every year, work, work.	Afe biara, adwuma, adwuma.
With difficulty we started to take him back to his room.	Yɛde ɔhaw fii ase san de no kɔɔ ne dan mu.
It’s not you.	Ɛnyɛ wo.
Someone really had to talk about what happened.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ obi ka nea esii no ho asɛm ankasa.
This time, it’s harder.	Saa bere yi de, ɛyɛ den sen saa.
First, my mind is obviously male.	Nea edi kan no, ɛda adi sɛ m’adwene yɛ ɔbarima de.
He says the same thing.	Ɔka saa ara.
Remove it from your group.	Yi fi wo kuw no mu.
People seem to be unaware of these issues.	Ɛte sɛ nea nkurɔfo nnim nsɛm yi ho hwee.
Mine hurt you.	Me de no yɛɛ wo yaw.
This was still going on.	Ná eyi da so ara rekɔ so.
Not that it wasn’t his style.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛnyɛ ne su.
The children spoke out against them.	Mmofra no kasa tiaa wɔn denneennen.
But it may not be.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
There may be three reasons for this.	Ebia nneɛma abiɛsa nti na eyi fi saa.
So he knew what was going on.	Enti na onim nea ɛrekɔ so.
I did it anyway.	Meyɛɛ no ​​ɔkwan biara so.
Which is incredibly, incredibly beautiful.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa, ɛyɛ fɛ a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Not much else.	Ɛnyɛ pii bio.
I have those who do.	Mewɔ wɔn a wɔyɛ saa.
I seem to have a lot to say.	Ɛte sɛ nea mewɔ nsɛm pii a mɛka.
Thank you so much for being there for her.	Meda wo ase pii sɛ wowɔ hɔ ama no.
I want to do my best.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nea metumi biara.
It had all gone wrong.	Ná ne nyinaa ankɔ yiye.
However, his speech is very important.	Nanso, ne kasa no ho hia paa.
One cannot do anything one wants.	Obi ntumi nyɛ biribiara a ɔpɛ.
He has forgotten her.	Ne werɛ afi no.
He was on me too fast.	Ná ɔwɔ me so ntɛmntɛm dodo.
But no happy legs.	Nanso nan a ɛyɛ anigye biara nni hɔ.
His eyes were still the same.	Ná n’ani da so ara te sɛ nea ɛte no ara.
The story will be the same.	Asɛm no bɛyɛ saa ara.
So much from there.	Enti pii fi hɔ.
He is only a child.	Ɔyɛ abofra nkutoo.
But there was something dangerous about him, too.	Nanso na biribi a ɛyɛ hu wɔ ne mu, nso.
The music played.	Nnwom no bɔɔ.
I am planning to go in with him first thing in the morning.	Mereyɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ me ne no bɛkɔ mu nea edi kan anɔpa.
But there is a problem with that.	Nanso ɔhaw bi wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
A real door, with alcohol and everything.	Ɔpon ankasa, a nsa ne biribiara wom.
Look at me.	Hwɛ me.
We have to do our best.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara.
I thought this method would work.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔkwan yi bɛyɛ adwuma.
You both look so happy.	Mo baanu nyinaa hwɛ sɛ mo ani agye yiye.
What do you think of that game?	Dɛn na wususuw wɔ saa agoru no ho?
His mother had apparently gone into the bedroom.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ne maame akɔ mpa no mu.
But it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ saa.
A picture this week.	Mfonini bi dapɛn yi.
Everyone has to start somewhere.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara fi ase wɔ baabi.
They were beautiful on the surface.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ fɛ wɔ anim.
But that’s all good.	Nanso ɛno nyinaa yɛ papa.
The animal was tall.	Ná aboa no tenten.
It was all happening.	Ná ne nyinaa rekɔ so.
I see it in him.	Mihu no wɔ ne mu.
The kindergarten overlooks the main road.	Mmofra sukuu no hwɛ ɔkwan kɛse no so.
The book looked interesting.	Ná nhoma no hwɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
You’re not feeling well.	Wo ho nyɛ wo den.
That’s certainly what’s happening here.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno ne nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
But something else.	Nanso biribi foforo.
And you don’t know.	Na wunnim.
Three hours ago.	Nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa a atwam ni.
Something that you need to do.	Biribi a ɛho hia sɛ woyɛ.
Things are similar.	Nneɛma te saa ara.
I’ll be happy with it.	M’ani begye ho.
Maybe something not so good.	Ebia biribi a ɛnyɛ papa saa.
Maybe you know it.	Ebia wunim.
It wasn’t fast or fun.	Ná ɛnyɛ ntɛmntɛm anaasɛ ɛnyɛ anigye.
I know a lot like you to be honest.	Minim pii te sɛ wo sɛ mɛka nokware a.
Thank you	Meda wo ase
Some of those people are my friends.	Saa nnipa no bi yɛ me nnamfo.
But there was no plan.	Nanso na nhyehyɛe biara nni hɔ.
I really want to see you.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wo ampa.
I told him first.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​kan.
We would have been happy.	Anka yɛn ani begye.
If so, he obviously didn’t know her well.	Sɛ saa a, na ɛda adi sɛ na onnim no yiye.
Not here or there.	Ɛnyɛ ha anaa ha.
Put your head down.	Fa wo ti to fam.
That’s the only time.	Ɛno nkutoo ne bere no.
He didn't want to tell anyone.	Na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ obiara.
That seemed to appeal to them.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ani gyee wɔn ho.
The police seized his car.	Polisifo no gyee ne kar no.
And yet, those things did happen.	Na nanso, saa nneɛma no sii ampa.
That’s an interesting idea.	Ɛno yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ anigye.
We have a lot in common.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ pɛ.
Not much longer.	Ɛnyɛ bere tenten pii bio.
The book is described as wonderful.	Wɔka nhoma no ho asɛm sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
What it was, it still is.	Nea na ɛwɔ hɔ no, ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
But you will be fine if you have a plan.	Nanso wo ho bɛtɔ wo sɛ wowɔ nhyehyɛe bi a.
You will be as good as new.	Wobɛyɛ papa te sɛ foforo.
There is nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
It’s not like me.	Ɛnte sɛ me.
And it has been used well.	Na wɔde adi dwuma yiye.
He had had one, too.	Ná ɔno nso anya bi.
He was a wonderful person.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
This story has been going on for a long time.	Saa asɛm yi akɔ so akyɛ.
He doesn’t care about the money.	Sika no ho nhia no.
It has been the past few days.	Ayɛ nna kakraa a atwam no.
Everyone has to start somewhere.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara fi ase wɔ baabi.
But it was still awesome.	Nanso na ɛda so ara yɛ hu.
The whole town heard about it.	Kurow no nyinaa tee saa asɛm no.
The important point is that they are both beautiful.	Asɛm a ɛho hia ne sɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa ho yɛ fɛ.
I find the concept strange.	Mihu sɛ adwene no yɛ nwonwa.
I wanted to say more.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka pii.
Did he cause you trouble?	Ɔde ɔhaw baa wo so anaa?
If he were, he would do more for me.	Sɛ ɔte saa a, anka ɔbɛyɛ me pii.
There is no part of it.	Ne fã biara nni hɔ.
No one did it anyway.	Obiara anyɛ no ɔkwan biara so.
It’s a human rights issue.	Ɛyɛ nnipa hokwan ahorow ho asɛm.
He had done it before.	Ná wayɛ no pɛn.
He has done too well.	Wayɛ no yiye dodo.
Maybe we are.	Ebia yɛn.
I have a great car.	Mewɔ kar kɛse bi.
But that doesn’t mean anything.	Nanso ɛno nkyerɛ hwee.
It was purely mental.	Na ɛyɛ adwene mu nneɛma nkutoo.
However, it is not mine.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ me de.
I can’t figure out how to do that.	Me ntumi nhu sɛnea mɛyɛ saa.
So it is important to know the language.	Enti ɛho hia sɛ wuhu kasa no.
Which I could only hope wasn’t ours.	Nea na metumi anya anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ yɛn de.
It was such a perfect plan.	Ná ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe a edi mũ saa.
It is not so.	Ɛnte saa.
Or even a month.	Anaasɛ ɔsram biako mpo.
I have been taking care of myself ever since.	Mehwɛ me ho so fi saa bere no.
There were parties out there.	Na apontow ahorow wɔ hɔ wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
This sounds pretty interesting.	Eyi te sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
You know you like it.	Wunim sɛ w’ani gye ho.
Completely fill in all the details.	Hyɛ nsɛm no nyinaa ma koraa.
So, it wasn’t very difficult.	Enti, na ɛnyɛ den koraa.
You obviously don’t need to use it.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛho nhia sɛ wode di dwuma.
I can help.	Metumi aboa.
We were playing games.	Ná yɛyɛ agoru.
Which is much easier.	Nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
If at all possible.	Sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye koraa a.
Thank you so much for it.	Meda ase paa wɔ ho.
You are better at it than I am.	Wo ho akokwaw wɔ mu sen me.
A terrible story indeed.	Asɛm a ɛyɛ hu ampa.
We are a few of them.	Yɛyɛ wɔn mu kakraa bi.
It’s just amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
Take advantage of each of these moments.	Fa saa bere yi mu biara di dwuma.
I just can’t get there right now.	Mintumi nkɔ hɔ mprempren ara kɛkɛ.
Who told you you could be here?	Hena na ɔka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ wubetumi aba ha?
And tell the stories.	Na ka nsɛm.
I want to talk to you.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa.
His one good arm and leg was going numb.	Ná ne nsa ne ne nan pa biako no reyɛ mmerɛw.
This is the time to act.	Eyi ne bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ade.
I don’t have to think about it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
Probably not, and then he would have.	Ebia na ɛnte saa, na saa bere no anka ɔbɛyɛ saa.
But none of that is the case.	Nanso ɛno mu biara nte saa.
This, really, this is it.	Eyi, ankasa, eyi ne no.
He's just great.	Ɔyɛ kɛse ara kwa.
I'm telling the truth.	Meka nokware.
Any idea where the problem is.	Adwene biara a ɛwɔ baabi a ɔhaw no wɔ.
Can anyone point me in the right direction.	So obi betumi akyerɛ me kwan akɔ ɔkwan pa so.
I hope the book does well.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ nhoma no bɛyɛ yiye.
Be careful, too.	Hwɛ yiye.
At the prestigious school, everyone was in awe of his paintings.	Wɔ sukuu a agye din no mu no, na obiara ho dwiriw no wɔ ne mfonini ahorow no ho.
We can all do that, or something like that.	Yɛn nyinaa betumi ayɛ saa, anaa biribi a ɛte saa.
But he wanted more.	Nanso na ɔpɛ pii sen saa.
Just look and remember.	Hwɛ kɛkɛ na kae.
We can’t tell.	Yɛrentumi nhu.
It’s like you know you’ve done something wrong.	Ɛte sɛ nea wunim sɛ woayɛ ade bɔne.
The night was over.	Ná anadwo no aba awiei.
Think of the long time ago.	Susuw bere tenten a atwam no ho hwɛ.
Everything was going on.	Ná biribiara rekɔ so.
He is much bigger.	Ɔyɛ kɛse kɛse.
I only see outside through one window.	Mfɛnsere biako pɛ na mihu abɔnten.
He is no longer a child.	Ɔnyɛ abofra bio.
It’s that simple!.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa!.
I really didn’t want anything else.	Ankasa na mempɛ biribi foforo biara.
It was a cold day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a awɔw wom.
This may take several hours.	Ebia eyi begye nnɔnhwerew pii.
He comes too.	Ɔno nso ba.
He was completely alone.	Ná ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ koraa.
It was amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa.
And think of one more thing.	Na susuw ade biako ho bio.
And so the story goes.	Na saa na asɛm no kɔ so.
Sometime after dinner there would be a game.	Bere bi wɔ anwummere aduan akyi no, na agoru bi bɛba.
Everything is nothing.	Biribiara nyɛ hwee.
The water is getting warmer.	Nsu no reyɛ hyew.
This is what our programs address.	Eyi ne nea yɛn nhyehyɛe ahorow no di ho dwuma.
Which is kind of the case.	Nea ɛyɛ ɔkwan bi so no.
He drove into town.	Ɔde kar kɔɔ kurow no mu.
I saw that article like a week ago.	Mihuu saa asɛm no te sɛ dapɛn biako a atwam ni.
I know his first name.	Minim ne din a edi kan.
You want to do this today.	Wopɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi nnɛ.
That’s not the only thing to be excited about.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo ne ade a ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye ho.
As such, there is no real party left.	Sɛnea ɛte no, apontow ankasa biara nni hɔ a aka.
Finally it was right here and right now.	Awiei koraa no na ɛwɔ ha yi ara ne mprempren yi ara.
You have to work on it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho adwuma.
I am a very realistic person.	Meyɛ obi a meyɛ obi a ɔyɛ nokware yiye.
Most of them are jobs.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara yɛ nnwuma a wɔyɛ.
So that was weird.	Enti na ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
That doesn’t mean the filmmakers aren’t real people.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ sini no nyɛ nnipa ankasa.
I want to understand.	Mepɛ sɛ mete ase.
Don’t want to.	Mma mpɛ.
Not in a bad way.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan bɔne so.
Things you need to know.	Nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
It’s not even a joke.	Ɛnyɛ agoru mpo.
That’s not part of it.	Ɛno nyɛ ne fã.
Not for the present.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren de.
There are so many things you can do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
We could have done this ourselves.	Anka yɛn ankasa betumi ayɛ eyi.
It was really that.	Ná ɛyɛ ɛno ankasa.
It wasn’t important in the story.	Na ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia wɔ asɛm no mu.
All courses must be administered by the same person.	Ɛsɛ sɛ onipa koro na ɔde adesua ahorow no nyinaa di dwuma.
He is a very jealous person.	Ɔyɛ obi a n’ani bere paa.
This will no doubt surprise them.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi bɛyɛ wɔn nwonwa.
These things are terrible.	Saa nneɛma yi yɛ hu.
It is true that it is a big part of it.	Ɛyɛ nokware sɛ ɛyɛ ne fã kɛse.
I have been using this a great deal.	Mede eyi ayɛ adwuma kɛse.
Most of it is done by hand.	Wɔde nsa na ɛyɛ ne fã kɛse no ara.
I'm very careful.	Mehwɛ yiye paa.
That will take time.	Ɛno begye bere.
But this problem still exists.	Nanso ɔhaw yi da so ara wɔ hɔ.
This is all built into the system.	Wɔde eyi nyinaa ahyɛ nhyehyɛe no mu.
Will you do that.	So wobɛyɛ saa.
Just then he stepped onto the road.	Saa bere no ara na ɔde ne nan sii kwan no so.
He had no problems.	Ná onni ɔhaw biara.
Which he must manually remove.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa yi fi hɔ.
So many things are out of their control.	Enti nneɛma pii nni wɔn tumi.
But it wasn’t about him.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ne ho asɛm.
He was very isolated.	Ɔde ne ho too nkyɛn paa.
I want to talk about something else.	Mepɛ sɛ meka biribi foforo ho asɛm.
You know the story.	Wunim asɛm no.
He had an independent home.	Ná ɔwɔ fie a ɔde ne ho.
My mother.	Mma nna.
I still have most of them.	Meda so ara wɔ wɔn mu dodow no ara.
And he certainly knew how to use it.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na onim sɛnea wɔde bedi dwuma.
I wish I could do as well as you.	Me yam a anka metumi ayɛ yiye te sɛ wo.
But this is something else.	Nanso eyi yɛ ade foforo.
I can see no reason why anyone would do this.	Mintumi nhu biribiara a enti obi bɛyɛ eyi.
I love this story.	M’ani gye saa asɛm yi ho.
The drought occurred in late summer.	Ɔpɛ no sii wɔ awɔw bere awiei.
In a few years that will be me.	Mfe kakraa bi akyi no ɛno bɛyɛ me.
This is doing with my mother.	Eyi ne me maame reyɛ.
People tend to forget about this.	Nkurɔfo werɛ taa fi eyi ho.
I even have two best friends.	Mewɔ nnamfo paa baanu mpo.
This was not supposed to happen.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi ba.
Only a few ingredients play a role in the dish.	Nneɛma kakraa bi pɛ na edi dwuma wɔ aduan no mu.
This is for.	Eyi ma.
I admire how much he treats his wife.	M’ani gye sɛnea ɔyɛ ne yere ho kɛse no ho.
And we’re not alone.	Na ɛnyɛ yɛn nkutoo na yɛyɛ saa.
Do you agree with me?.	Wo ne me yɛ adwene?.
But man's word must be true.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ onipa asɛm di mu.
The boy was doing well.	Ná abarimaa no reyɛ yiye.
See what you can find.	Hwɛ nea wubetumi ahu.
I want you to be aware of that.	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu saa asɛm no yiye.
The product was widely used.	Wɔde ade no dii dwuma kɛse.
He could show it to her.	Ná obetumi de akyerɛ no.
That was like a given to us.	Ná ɛno te sɛ nea wɔde ama yɛn.
That’s why the two of us went there at night time.	Ɛno nti na yɛn baanu kɔɔ hɔ anadwo bere.
That’s still not good, but apparently it was good enough.	Ɛno da so ara nyɛ papa, nanso ɛda adi sɛ na eye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
You can find it here.	Wubetumi ahu wɔ ha.
How else are you planning to warm up?	Ɔkwan foforo bɛn so na woreyɛ nhyehyɛe ama wo ho ayɛ wo hyew?
Our city cannot afford these problems.	Yɛn kurow no ntumi nnya ɔhaw ahorow yi.
He had no help last year.	Na onni mmoa biara afe a etwaam no.
That is the best thing.	Ɛno ne ade a eye sen biara.
Only I can do it.	Me nkutoo na metumi ayɛ.
He is not as bad as everyone says.	Ɔnyɛ bɔne sɛnea obiara ka no.
No one really wants to do that.	Obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa ankasa.
But his plan had one danger.	Nanso na ne nhyehyɛe no wɔ asiane biako.
The child told me the story.	Abofra no kaa me asɛm no.
No wonder he looked so familiar.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ na ɔte sɛ nea onim no yiye.
Many of us have been saying this for years.	Yɛn mu pii aka eyi mfe pii ni.
Or so any number of people have told me.	Anaasɛ saa na nnipa dodow biara aka akyerɛ me.
It’s not difficult.	Ɛnyɛ den.
Many never made it to his room.	Nnipa pii antumi ankɔ ne dan mu da.
So he signed it off.	Enti ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ ase.
Which is good.	Nea eye.
Her hair was still wet.	Ná ne ti nhwi da so ara yɛ nsu.
He was as quick as he was powerful.	Ná ɔyɛ ntɛm te sɛ nea na ɔwɔ tumi no ara pɛ.
I had no power here.	Ná minni tumi biara wɔ ha.
He did so.	Ɔyɛɛ saa.
Out there was himself.	Wɔ abɔnten hɔ no, na ɔno ankasa wɔ hɔ.
It’s important.	Ɛho hia.
Someone has to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ saa.
He knew it was a mistake, too.	Na onim sɛ na ɛyɛ mfomso, nso.
You just don’t know why.	Ɛnyɛ saa ara na wunim nea enti a ɛte saa.
One lives his presence.	Obi de ne ba a ɔwɔ hɔ no tra ase.
All sorts of things.	Nneɛma ahorow nyinaa.
In this case, it is.	Wɔ eyi mu no, ɛte saa.
I didn’t even know you had a car.	Ná minnim mpo sɛ wowɔ kar.
He loved this room.	N’ani gyee dan yi ho.
There is much that will be new.	Pii wɔ hɔ a ɛbɛyɛ foforo.
And he was so, so strong.	Na na ɔyɛ den saa, saa.
The decision was made unanimously.	Wɔde adwene koro sii gyinae no.
But it’s early so far.	Nanso ɛyɛ ntɛm de besi nnɛ.
At least most of us do.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yɛn mu dodow no ara yɛ saa.
There was not much time for us.	Ná bere pii nni hɔ mma yɛn.
Another busy morning.	Anɔpa foforo a adagyew nnim.
That is the case right now.	Saa na ɛte mprempren yi ara.
There were three problems with this.	Ná ɔhaw abiɛsa wɔ eyi ho.
Everyone needs to know this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara hu eyi.
He didn't know why.	Ná onnim nea enti a ɔyɛɛ saa.
But it is not forgotten.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea wɔn werɛ afi.
It’s really pretty simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye ankasa.
That will be another book.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nhoma foforo.
Often more complicated than that.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den sen saa.
He didn't really want to be here.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔwɔ ha ankasa.
The point is simple.	Asɛm no yɛ mmerɛw.
Everything should work now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribiara yɛ adwuma mprempren.
However, we can work on that.	Nanso, yebetumi ayɛ saa asɛm no ho adwuma.
I question everything now.	Migye biribiara ho kyim mprempren.
The first one wasn’t good.	Ná nea edi kan no nyɛ papa.
It’s too scary, too scary.	Ɛyɛ hu dodo, ɛyɛ hu dodo.
See, like it or not.	Hwɛ, wopɛ anaasɛ wompɛ.
I believe in good works.	Migye nnwuma pa di.
More was to follow.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ pii di akyi.
When is the best time to do this?	Bere bɛn na eye sen biara a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi?
I can still taste it.	Meda so ara tumi ka ho hwɛ.
If that is necessary.	Sɛ ɛno ho hia a.
It must be difficult indeed.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den ampa.
He is indeed like that.	Ɔte saa ampa.
He was working.	Ná ɔreyɛ adwuma.
You know, my kid is a good kid.	Wunim, me ba no yɛ abofra pa.
And play well.	Na di agoru yiye.
I think he is the only one.	Misusuw sɛ ɔno nkutoo ne obi.
Well, why not.	Ampa, dɛn nti na ɛnte saa.
But there is one problem.	Nanso ɔhaw biako wɔ hɔ.
But the real problem begins here.	Nanso ɔhaw ankasa no fi ase wɔ ha.
And, in a sense, it was.	Na, wɔ ɔkwan bi so no, na ɛte saa.
And most of them do.	Na wɔn mu dodow no ara yɛ saa.
I can’t think on my feet.	Mintumi nsusuw nneɛma ho wɔ me nan so.
He was an interesting man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a n’ani gye ho.
I can't.	Mintumi.
I can’t feel that way.	Mintumi nte nka saa.
But you can see it.	Nanso wubetumi ahu.
She is a beautiful girl.	Ɔyɛ abeawa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
His other hand added there.	Ne nsa foforo no de kaa ho wɔ hɔ.
This alone was exciting.	Ná eyi nkutoo yɛ anigye.
Perhaps the latter.	Ebia nea etwa to no.
If possible, each participant determines his or her own amount.	Sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye a, obiara a ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu no ankasa kyerɛ dodow a ɔde ma.
I want to be nice to him.	Mepɛ sɛ me ho yɛ fɛ ma no.
There were just so many people.	Ná nnipa pii wɔ hɔ ara kwa.
Everything a good man can be, he is.	Biribiara a onipa pa betumi ayɛ no, ɔte saa.
That’s about all, kid.	Ɛno fa ne nyinaa ho, abofra.
Mom served a big meal every day.	Ná Maame de aduan kɛse bi ma da biara da.
', was '.	', na '.
His mother cried.	Ne maame su.
He knows what the mind has to say.	Onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ adwene no ka.
If they do, it’s great.	Sɛ wɔyɛ saa a, ɛyɛ kɛse.
I would have loved it.	Anka m’ani begye ho.
You will work best with people you know.	Wo ne nnipa a wunim wɔn bɛyɛ adwuma a eye sen biara.
People can say anything.	Nkurɔfo betumi aka biribiara.
It would be the same idea.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ adwene koro no ara.
Just a little bit.	Kakraa bi pɛ.
The smart money went elsewhere.	Sika a nyansa wom no kɔɔ baabi foforo.
We are very close friends.	Yɛyɛ nnamfo paa.
And yet someone has to be able to do something about it.	Na nanso ɛsɛ sɛ obi tumi yɛ ho biribi.
I enjoyed the work.	M’ani gyee adwuma no ho.
It is a very unremarkable document.	Ɛyɛ krataa a ɛnyɛ nwonwa koraa.
A really good book.	Nhoma pa ankasa.
Which he certainly was.	Nea akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔyɛ.
Not a bad way.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan bɔne bi.
All the money was spent on expensive items.	Wɔde sika no nyinaa yɛɛ nneɛma a ne bo yɛ den.
You may even feel bad about it.	Ebia mpo ɛyɛ wo yaw wɔ ho.
Your father should continue to do so.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo papa kɔ so yɛ saa.
But we have to be realistic.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nokware.
But that was not what he wanted to do.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
What is so strange about that???.	Dɛn na ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ saa asɛm no ho???.
He seemed to want to tell us something.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka biribi kyerɛ yɛn.
However, a bug has crept in along the way.	Nanso, mfomso bi ahyɛ mu wɔ kwan no so.
He was also quite good at it.	Ná ɔno nso ho akokwaw koraa wɔ mu.
Lie to him.	Di atoro kyerɛ no.
There is nothing he can do now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ mprempren.
Tell your father.	Ka kyerɛ wo papa.
It was an amazing time to be a kid.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ mɛyɛ abofra.
The school was overcrowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ sukuu no mu ma dodo.
I couldn’t get him.	Na mintumi nnya no.
It should be beautiful.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ.
They only tell you.	Wɔka kyerɛ wo nkutoo.
It was a dangerous game.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a asiane wom.
This species has soft fur.	Saa aboa yi wɔ aboa nhoma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Strange things have happened here.	Nsɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa asi wɔ ha.
How wonderful, you might say.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ nwonwa, ebia wobɛka.
At least here we can keep an eye on them for a while.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ha na yebetumi ahwɛ wɔn so kakra.
That’s right, of course.	Ɛte saa, ampa.
My mother was there.	Ná me maame wɔ hɔ.
That’s not how it works.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛyɛ adwuma.
The task was not easy.	Ná adwuma no nyɛ mmerɛw.
It was like an accident.	Ná ɛte sɛ akwanhyia bi.
They all look like .	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ nea ɛte sɛ .
Know what the item is worth.	Hu nea ade no bo yɛ den.
So let it be so.	Enti ma ɛnyɛ saa.
Something no human being here can do.	Biribi a onipa biara nni ha ntumi nyɛ.
She stroked his raven hair.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne ti nhwi a ɛyɛ ɔkraman no.
Not all of it is good.	Ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa na eye.
Police often see people.	Polisifo taa hu nkurɔfo.
Maybe someone told them.	Ebia obi ka kyerɛɛ wɔn.
That’s it, it’s not.	Ɛno ne no, ɛnte saa.
Everyone knew, but not me.	Ná obiara nim, nanso na ɛnyɛ me.
I had very little food.	Ná aduan kakraa bi na na mewɔ.
Get out of this city.	Fi kurow yi mu.
He has to be a great person in this long stretch.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ onipa kɛse wɔ saa bere tenten yi mu.
It was just mine.	Ná ɛyɛ me de ara kwa.
The door slammed shut.	Ɔpon no bɔɔ mu.
I can’t do anything today or even this week.	Mintumi nyɛ biribiara nnɛ anaa dapɛn yi mpo.
But there is one that is quite new.	Nanso biako wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ foforo koraa.
That is a very big deal.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse paa.
Alternative music.	Nnwom a wɔde di dwuma wɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
Truth, however, is a whole other story.	Nanso, nokware yɛ asɛm foforo koraa.
He interfered, but things were too expensive inside.	Ɔde ne ho gyee mu, nanso na nneɛma bo yɛ den dodo wɔ mu.
A, these words.	A, saa nsɛm yi.
Fashionable clothes.	Ntade a aba so.
Surely we can use it right now.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ yebetumi de adi dwuma mprempren ara.
I still wasn’t in the class.	Na meda so ara nkɔ adesua no mu.
There is no doubt about that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
This is his home.	Eyi ne ne fie.
So, how we act matters.	Enti, sɛnea yɛyɛ yɛn ade no ho hia.
I can’t make it work for me.	Mintumi mma ɛnyɛ adwuma mma me.
And they do that.	Na wɔyɛ saa.
The goods have been moved from one city to another.	Wɔde nneɛma no afi kurow biako mu akɔ foforo mu.
There would be more long walks soon.	Anka nantew tenten pii bɛba nnansa yi ara.
Somewhere inside him, he knew it wasn’t true.	Wɔ ne mu baabi no, na onim sɛ ɛnyɛ nokware.
So this is a very delicate time.	Enti eyi yɛ bere a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
He spent the next few days painting the house.	Ɔde nna kakraa a edi hɔ no yɛɛ ofie no ho mfonini.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Ebia, ebia, ebia.
Everyone had something to say about it.	Ná obiara wɔ biribi ka fa ho.
It was always obvious, that would be quick.	Na ɛda adi bere nyinaa, ɛno bɛyɛ ntɛm.
This man	Saa ɔbarima yi .
So here is the story.	Enti asɛm a wɔka no ni.
I'm in the next room.	Mewɔ dan a edi hɔ no mu.
But he’s not.	Nanso ɔno de.
I sure hope he does.	Mewɔ anidaso ampa sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
He worked for them.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma maa wɔn.
I want to see you every day.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wo da biara da.
They took risks.	Wɔde wɔn ho too asiane mu.
This is true for everyone.	Eyi yɛ nokware ma obiara.
That doesn’t matter now.	Ɛno ho nhia mprempren.
This is not good enough for us.	Eyi nyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ wɔ yɛn fam.
This is the same thing.	Eyi te saa ara.
That was not my intention.	Ná ɛnyɛ m’adwene ne sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
It was very very expensive.	Ná ne bo yɛ den yiye paa.
I love the reactions when people come over.	M’ani gye sɛnea nkurɔfo yɛ wɔn ade bere a nkurɔfo ba hɔ no ho.
Everything and everyone.	Biribiara ne obiara.
But this has both positive and negative consequences.	Nanso eyi de nneɛma pa ne bɔne nyinaa fi mu ba.
I didn’t know what was going on.	Ná minnim nea ɛrekɔ so no.
I didn’t want to hear it.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete.
You have to want to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ.
It’s perfect for us.	Ɛyɛ pɛ ma yɛn.
They were received with great enthusiasm.	Wɔde anigye kɛse gyee wɔn.
I think, finally, the time has come.	Misusuw sɛ, awiei koraa no, bere no adu.
That thing is terrible.	Saa ade no yɛ hu.
And this put it just too dramatically.	Na eyi de too hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa dodo ara kwa.
He told her that he might.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ebia ɔbɛyɛ saa.
Just get started.	Fi ase ara kwa.
Maybe we’ll do that.	Ebia yɛbɛyɛ saa.
However, it is what it is.	Nanso, ɛyɛ nea ɛte.
His kids have played with my kids.	Ne mma ne me mma adi agoru.
They are all this price and size.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ saa bo ne ne kɛse yi.
Once upon a time.	Bere bi.
He was enthusiastically involved in the project.	Ɔde anigye de ne ho hyɛɛ adwuma no mu.
Neither person was capable of sharing power easily.	Ná onipa baanu no mu biara nyɛ obi a obetumi akyɛ tumi a ɛnyɛ den.
He knew her well.	Ná onim no yiye.
It’s definitely interesting.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
The picture shows you that.	Mfonini no kyerɛ wo saa.
This was a great one.	Ná eyi yɛ kɛse.
Just look around for a moment.	Hwɛ wo ho kakra kɛkɛ.
You need to talk to him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no kasa.
He quickly glanced at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no ​​ntɛmntɛm.
It was a happy time.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye bere.
No one should be so present.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara yɛ obi a ɔwɔ hɔ saa.
This is one of the latter.	Eyi yɛ nea etwa to no mu biako.
They are as happy as we are.	Wɔn ani gye te sɛ yɛn ara.
This thing is great!	Saa ade yi yɛ kɛse!
So they both seem to be doing the same thing.	Enti ɛte sɛ nea wɔn baanu nyinaa reyɛ ade koro.
There is nothing better to do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a eye sen saa a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Or at least give it a better chance.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ma no hokwan a eye sen biara.
They were very expensive.	Ná wɔn bo yɛ den yiye.
One has to be careful.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi hwɛ yiye.
There are many things.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ.
Everyone seems to have a side or two.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara wɔ ne fã biako anaa abien.
The boy was too controlling.	Ná abarimaa no di ne ho so dodo.
I used that statement.	Mede saa asɛm no dii dwuma.
Finally, someone found him.	Awiei koraa no, obi huu no.
But somehow it was too late.	Nanso ɔkwan bi so no, na aka akyi dodo.
That worked great.	Ɛno yɛɛ adwuma kɛse.
Just remember that these things are not real.	Kae kɛkɛ sɛ saa nneɛma yi nyɛ ade a ɛrekɔ so ankasa.
There was no sense of excitement.	Ná anigye nka biara nni asɛm no mu.
The most important thing is planning.	Ade a ɛho hia sen biara ne nhyehyɛe a wɔyɛ.
There are some interesting things.	Nneɛma bi a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ hɔ.
I can’t keep food down.	Mintumi mma aduan nkɔ fam.
We can’t do it alone.	Yɛn nkutoo ntumi nyɛ.
You want to act.	Wopɛ sɛ woyɛ ade.
And save the day.	Na gye da no nkwa.
But it didn’t go very far.	Nanso ankɔ akyiri koraa.
His problems seem more psychological.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne haw ahorow no yɛ adwene mu de kɛse.
But his plans were no longer necessary.	Nanso na ne nhyehyɛe ahorow no ho nhia bio.
The whole group.	Kuw no nyinaa.
I thought you were someone else.	Misusuwii sɛ woyɛ obi foforo.
This was perfect.	Ná eyi yɛ pɛ.
A car, anyway.	Kar bi, ɔkwan biara so.
He had a full license.	Ná ɔwɔ tumi krataa a edi mũ.
That’s wonderful now.	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa mprempren.
It’s not for everyone.	Ɛnyɛ obiara de.
Lunch is easy to make, she says.	Ɔka sɛ ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ awia aduan.
But this is not the only one.	Nanso ɛnyɛ eyi nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho.
It’s something we live with every day.	Ɛyɛ biribi a yɛde tra ase da biara da.
Even if that someone is me.	Sɛ mpo saa obi no yɛ me a.
They were interested in me.	Wɔn ani gyee me ho.
I hoped so too.	Ná me nso mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
I would do it for my son.	Anka mɛyɛ ama me ba no.
You don’t have to make the movie.	Ɛho nhia sɛ woyɛ sini no.
Say please.	Ka sɛ mesrɛ wo.
He was so comfortable with things.	Ná ne ho tɔɔ no kɛse wɔ nneɛma ho.
You have a lot of fun.	Wowɔ anigye kɛse.
He would tell them.	Ná ɔbɛka akyerɛ wɔn.
You got money.	Wo nyaa sika.
You are very vulnerable.	Wo ho yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
He stared at the problem for years.	Ɔde mfe pii hwɛɛ ɔhaw no denneennen.
Just think of the fun.	Susuw anigye no nkutoo ho.
She was very charming and charming.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye na na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It was just great.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa.
And this time, he was part of a team.	Na saa bere yi de, na ɔka kuw bi ho.
Presentation of study material.	Adesua ho nsɛm a wɔde bɛma.
The water became stronger.	Nsu no mu yɛɛ den.
Raise your hands above your head.	Ma wo nsa so wɔ wo ti so.
To an object.	De kɔ ade bi so.
He was always good to me.	Ná ɔyɛ papa ma me bere nyinaa.
I don’t like you guys either.	M’ani nnye mo nso ho.
I did both of them.	Meyɛɛ abien no nyinaa.
But it was true.	Nanso na ɛyɛ nokware.
They are very inexpensive.	Wɔn bo nyɛ den koraa.
No one knows him.	Obiara nnim no.
I do the same thing.	Meyɛ saa ara.
He hurried back to bed.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm san kɔɔ mpa so.
It was too late.	Ná akyɛ dodo.
And still for a few more things.	Na ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ ma nneɛma kakraa bi bio.
But the reason was interesting.	Nanso na nea enti a ɛte saa no yɛ anigye.
Our names are important.	Yɛn din ho hia.
That was his only plan.	Ná ɛno nkutoo ne ne nhyehyɛe.
The kids were always arguing.	Ná mmofra no gye akyinnye bere nyinaa.
I hope you enjoyed it.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani gyee ho.
What a beautiful idea.	Adwene a ɛyɛ fɛ bɛn ara ni.
Nothing to schedule.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
I'm doing that.	Meyɛ saa.
Most of the time, though, you don’t.	Nanso, mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ saa na woyɛ.
I can’t do it right now.	Me ntumi nyɛ no mprempren ara.
So the same approach is not possible.	Enti saa kwan no ara ntumi nyɛ yiye.
He didn't know the name either.	Ná onnim din no nso.
I saw everything alone.	Me nkutoo na mihuu biribiara.
I was in class.	Ná mewɔ adesua mu.
I know him very well.	Minim no yiye.
However, it is clearly not.	Nanso, ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
Supplies were scarce.	Ná nneɛma a wɔde bɛma no ho yɛ na.
But it was never like that.	Nanso na ɛte saa da.
However, we were all in for a surprise.	Nanso, na yɛn nyinaa wɔ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa mu.
I just had to do it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ara kwa.
It’s your fault.	Ɛyɛ wo mfomso.
Both have many flaws.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa wɔ mfomso ahorow pii.
Everything looked good.	Ná biribiara hwɛ yiye.
I know it in myself.	Minim no wɔ me ankasa mu.
People were really very interested in this.	Ná nkurɔfo ani gye eyi ho kɛse ankasa.
You do it at just the right time.	Bere a ɛsɛ mu ara na woyɛ saa.
It’s such a crazy, crazy time.	Ɛyɛ kraman bere a ɛte saa, kraman bere a ɛte saa.
Start with a few things.	Fa nneɛma kakraa bi fi ase.
Without a doubt, he should.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I know that for sure.	Minim saa ankasa.
That sounds like a good thing.	Ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ ade pa.
And he didn’t know her.	Na onnim no.
I can’t do much.	Mintumi nyɛ pii.
I want to do this right.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi yiye.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Plan and be on time.	Yɛ nhyehyɛe na yɛ bere ano.
It was a decision they made for themselves.	Ná ɛyɛ gyinae a wɔn ankasa asi.
We do a variety of tests.	Yɛyɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow ahorow.
There was already a movie in the works.	Na sini bi wɔ hɔ dedaw wɔ adwuma no mu.
This man seems to know a lot about this city.	Ɛte sɛ nea saa ɔbarima yi nim kurow yi ho nsɛm pii.
He had his mind completely now.	Ná ɔwɔ n’adwene koraa mprempren.
This wonderful room.	Saa dan a ɛyɛ nwonwa yi.
This is a very strange idea.	Eyi yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
There was something else.	Na biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
There are still two others.	Nnipa baanu foforo da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Approach them, let them see.	Bɛn wɔn, ma wɔn ani nhu.
But, boy, he made you.	Nanso, abarimaa, ɔno na ɔyɛɛ wo.
I have been working on this.	Mayɛ eyi ho adwuma.
He had no control over that.	Ná onni saa asɛm no so tumi biara.
What happened here today is not a mistake.	Nea esii wɔ ha nnɛ no nyɛ mfomso.
That is because the policy says so.	Nea enti a ɛte saa ne sɛ nhyehyɛe no ka saa.
The meeting should not have happened.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ nhyiam no ba.
He’s not that bad.	Ɔnyɛ bɔne saa.
He told you to do it.	Ɔno na ɔka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ yɛ.
His wife.	Ne yere.
It must be some of our people.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn nkurɔfo no bi.
But he seems to understand a little.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɔte ase kakra.
It was really nice to be there.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye ankasa sɛ mewɔ hɔ.
Surely you should know that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu saa.
But it’s temporary.	Nanso ɛyɛ bere tiaa mu de.
There has to be order.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nhyehyɛe wɔ hɔ.
He too felt terribly alone.	Ɔno nso tee nka wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu so sɛ ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
My people	Me nkurɔfo .
At this point the examination fee begins.	Saa bere yi na sɔhwɛ ho sika no fi ase.
But it was terrible.	Nanso na ɛyɛ hu.
And you are no doubt well aware of that.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wunim saa asɛm no yiye.
He doesn’t like us.	Ɔmpɛ yɛn asɛm.
But it’s a team game.	Nanso ɛyɛ kuw agoru.
That was about two years ago.	Ɛno yɛ bɛyɛ mfe abien a atwam ni.
It wasn’t his fault.	Ná ɛnyɛ ne mfomso.
Happy to be with him.	Anigye sɛ wo ne no bɛbɔ.
I have to think of everything he touched.	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw biribiara a ɔde ne nsa kaa ho no ho.
He wasn’t a child.	Ná ɔnyɛ abofra.
That is indeed the case.	Saa na ɛte ampa.
It should be inside.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ mu.
I need to talk to him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa.
A little big for a girl.	Kɛse kakra ma abeawa bi.
They’re the real bad guys anyway.	Wɔn na wɔyɛ bɔne ankasa ɔkwan biara so.
Maybe this time things will work out.	Ebia saa bere yi de nneɛma bɛkɔ yiye.
He was fast, but not fast enough.	Ná ɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm, nanso na ɔnyɛ ntɛmntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
That other girl is hot.	Saa abeawa foforo no ho yɛ hyew.
If you are lucky.	Sɛ wowɔ anigye a.
This is hope for me.	Eyi yɛ anidaso ma me.
Maybe one day we can get there like music.	Ebia da bi yebetumi adu hɔ te sɛ nnwom.
And that, as they say, was it.	Na ɛno, sɛnea wɔka no, na ɛyɛ saa.
It’s just a door.	Ɛyɛ ɔpon bi kɛkɛ.
These shoes are comfortable.	Saa mpaboa yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
He doesn’t want me to go there.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ.
Life is short enough.	Nkwa yɛ tiaa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
However, it has been a lot.	Nanso, ayɛ pii.
Not that he had to do many of them.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ wɔn mu pii.
But he made that statement.	Nanso ɔno na ɔyɛɛ saa asɛm no.
I just can't see why it doesn't work here.	Mintumi nhu nea enti a ɛnyɛ adwuma wɔ ha kɛkɛ.
There was no one else.	Na obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
It’s enough.	Ɛdɔɔso.
That had been a long time coming.	Ná ɛno aba bere tenten.
At least not as much as you should.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no.
This is not that complicated.	Eyi nyɛ nea ɛyɛ den saa.
It was a boy's.	Ná ɛyɛ abarimaa de.
When it’s underneath, it’s amazing.	Sɛ ɛwɔ ase a, ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It was mid-morning.	Ná ɛyɛ anɔpa fã.
I was once one of those kids.	Bere bi na meyɛ saa mmofra no mu biako.
The materials were completely waterproof.	Ná nneɛma a wɔde yɛɛ no ​​yɛ nea nsu ntumi nkɔ mu koraa.
Remind him to do his homework.	Kae no sɛ ɔnyɛ ne fie nnwuma.
I have a strong handshake.	Mewɔ nsa a wɔde bɔ me denneennen.
That went well.	Ɛno kɔɔ so yiye.
The house is amazing.	Ofie no yɛ nwonwa.
You live here with him.	Wo ne no te ha.
At least we had that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na yɛwɔ saa.
I only heard about it yesterday.	Nnɛra nkutoo na metee ho asɛm.
He went out himself.	Ɔno ankasa fii adi.
They all knew their last moment had come.	Ná wɔn nyinaa nim sɛ wɔn bere a etwa to no adu.
I'm sure there's a place for it.	Migye di sɛ baabi wɔ hɔ ma no.
But it’s true.	Nanso ɛyɛ nokware.
It does, without a doubt.	Ɛyɛ saa, akyinnye biara nni ho.
Just like his father.	Te sɛ ne papa ara pɛ.
But you are a human being.	Nanso woyɛ onipa.
Your father had such an unprecedented interest in it.	Na wo papa wɔ ho anigye a ɛte saa a na ɛnte saa da.
I don’t know why or when.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa anaa bere bɛn.
Thank you for adding it.	Meda mo ase sɛ wode aka ho.
Mom will be happy.	Maame ani begye.
How am I going to do this.	Mɛyɛ dɛn ayɛ eyi.
I'm on you.	Mewɔ wo so.
I have to be there.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ.
Most of them, no doubt.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara, akyinnye biara nni ho.
The two stared at each other briefly.	Wɔn baanu no hwɛɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho denneennen bere tiaa bi.
He was on it anyway.	Ná ɔwɔ so ɔkwan biara so.
So, really, please.	Enti, ampa, mesrɛ wo.
The days went on.	Nna no kɔɔ so.
I was still going to school.	Ná meda so ara kɔ sukuu.
Why was he here anyway.	Dɛn nti na na ɔwɔ ha sɛnea ɛte biara.
One went into a room.	Biako kɔɔ dan bi mu.
Forget it, and forget this night ever happened.	Wo werɛ mfi, na wo werɛ mfi saa anadwo yi a asi pɛn.
He gave the boy some money.	Ɔde sika bi maa abarimaa no.
I would like to add one more thing though.	Mepɛ sɛ mede ade biako bio ka ho nanso.
Now that is more important.	Seesei ɛno ho hia kɛse.
A big problem.	Ɔhaw kɛse bi.
There was a girl and a boy.	Ná abeawa bi ne abarimaa bi wɔ hɔ.
And I don’t think you’ll like it.	Na minsusuw sɛ w’ani begye ho.
I like to do almost anything fun.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ m’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ biribiara a ɛyɛ anigye.
It was last year.	Ná ɛyɛ afe a etwaam no.
I felt that he understood me.	Metee nka sɛ ɔte me ase.
Many people are interested in him.	Nnipa pii ani gye ne ho.
It was very difficult.	Na ayɛ den yiye.
You didn’t have to .	Ná enhia sɛ woyɛ saa .
I couldn’t believe him.	Ná mintumi nnye no nni.
And it wasn’t his.	Na ɛnyɛ ne de.
I just work here.	Meyɛ adwuma wɔ ha ara kwa.
It was good there.	Ná eye wɔ hɔ.
The conclusions were surprising.	Ná nsɛm a wɔde baa awiei no yɛ nwonwa.
Transportation has gone a long way.	Nneɛma a wɔde fa nnipa no akɔ akyiri.
But not too long.	Nanso ɛnyɛ tenten dodo.
I just can’t let myself eat more.	Mintumi mma me ho nni pii kɛkɛ.
The name of the group intrigued me.	Kuw no din maa m’ani gyee ho.
If you want a little more.	Sɛ wopɛ kakra a.
But he wasn’t, and he knew it.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ saa, na na onim.
I have one with me.	Mewɔ bi wɔ me nkyɛn.
Everyone makes this mistake at some point.	Obiara di mfomso yi wɔ bere bi mu.
That’s an expensive thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade a ne bo yɛ den.
He is a great man.	Ɔyɛ onipa kɛse.
You know it’s all bad but it feels so good.	Wunim sɛ ne nyinaa yɛ bɔne nanso ɛte nka sɛ eye paa.
You don’t have to work with me.	Wo ne me nyɛ adwuma.
I should have told you first.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo kan.
But it works out for me.	Nanso ɛyɛ yiye ma me.
I know he just wants the best for you.	Minim sɛ ɔpɛ nea eye sen biara ma wo ara kwa.
All on time.	Ne nyinaa wɔ bere ano.
I believe this statement.	Migye saa asɛm yi di.
I know my father.	Minim me papa.
Something completely different.	Ade foforo koraa.
I hope you have done well.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ woayɛ no yiye.
That was the dog.	Ná ɛno ne ɔkraman no.
Probably why it is so popular.	Ebia nea enti a nkurɔfo ani gye ho saa no.
He was too busy for us.	Ná onni adagyew dodo ma yɛn.
But those days were in the past.	Nanso na saa nna no yɛ bere a atwam.
I know how someone feels.	Minim sɛnea obi te nka.
Check out what he had to say below.	Hwɛ nea na ɔwɔ sɛ ɔka wɔ ase hɔ.
He didn’t know anything.	Ná onnim hwee.
I never wanted to work for someone else.	Na mempɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma ma obi foforo da.
His words well describe our situation today.	Ne nsɛm no kyerɛ yɛn tebea no yiye nnɛ.
I don’t know where we are now.	Minnim baabi a yɛwɔ mprempren.
It’s a big problem.	Ɛyɛ a, ɛyɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
See supplementary material for additional information.	Hwɛ nsɛm a wɔde ka ho ma nsɛm foforo.
Maybe that very night.	Ebia saa anadwo no ara.
Stick with me for a moment.	Fa wo ho hyɛ me mu kakra.
I felt that way now.	Metee nka saa mprempren.
The experiment was successful.	Sɔhwɛ no dii yiye.
You are in my way.	Wowɔ me kwan so.
One chance, and that was that.	Hokwan biako, na ɛno ne no.
He had a wonderful game.	Ná ɔwɔ agoru bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I believe it will work.	Migye di sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
There was nothing left on the road.	Ná hwee nni ɔkwan no so bio.
We were never supposed to work on that side.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma wɔ saa fã no da.
This is the ultimate.	Eyi yɛ nea etwa to koraa.
His plan has worked.	Ne nhyehyɛe no ayɛ yiye.
That’s my plan.	Ɛno ne me nhyehyɛe.
These shoes are made of leather.	Wɔde aboa nhoma na ɛyɛ saa mpaboa yi.
The plan for the new project is not necessary.	Nhyehyɛe a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma foforo no ho nhia.
And you know, it was quite good.	Na wunim, na eye koraa.
It’s too imperfect.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛnyɛ pɛ dodo.
But there are many factors to consider.	Nanso nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
They have been added.	Wɔde aka ho.
I found myself.	Mihuu me ho.
And the phone, at the same time.	Na telefon no, bere koro no ara mu.
I think he’s one of the best.	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ papa sen biara no mu biako.
No one, nothing else.	Obiara nni hɔ, biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
That’s the hardest one.	Ɛno ne nea ɛyɛ den yiye.
That was no accident.	Ná ɛno nyɛ akwanhyia.
He will do so.	Ɔbɛyɛ saa.
You have to give it to him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode ma no.
He wasn’t the one.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɔno na ɔte saa.
My father knew what was going on.	Ná me papa nim nea ɛrekɔ so.
I don’t care much about the past.	M’ani nnye nneɛma a atwam ho kɛse.
I think this is going to be really interesting.	Misusuw sɛ eyi bɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
You can play with this all you want.	Wubetumi de eyi adi agoru nea wopɛ nyinaa.
It’s just the two of them.	Ɛyɛ wɔn baanu no nkutoo.
Everything is there.	Biribiara wɔ hɔ.
He is not himself.	Ɔnyɛ ɔno ankasa.
There were no furniture in this room.	Ná nneɛma biara nni dan yi mu.
There are probably two reasons for this.	Ebia nneɛma abien nti na ɛte saa.
I don't have a better one.	Minni bi a eye sen saa.
They have been established.	Wɔde asi hɔ.
This is great this inexpensive bed for this price.	Eyi yɛ kɛse yi mpa a ne bo nyɛ den ma saa bo yi.
They are both on the ground.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa wɔ fam.
It is still in use.	Ɛda so ara yɛ nea wɔde di dwuma.
Keep up the good work.	Kɔ so hwɛ sɛnea wobɛka asɛm no.
Something seemed very strange about him.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribi yɛ nwonwa yiye wɔ ne ho.
This book was very challenging, but not difficult.	Ná nhoma yi yɛ den yiye, nanso na ɛnyɛ den.
In the past it wasn’t.	Kan no na ɛnte saa.
There is nothing wrong with simplicity.	Mfomso biara nni nneɛma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ho.
Can someone please help me with this.	Mesrɛ sɛ obi betumi aboa me wɔ eyi ho.
I also had a hard time concentrating.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma me nso sɛ mede m’adwene besi biribi so.
But it’s not easy.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
As a result, it feels fresh and exciting again.	Ne saa nti, ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ foforo na ɛyɛ anigye bio.
Time to do something.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribi.
Either way, use them.	Ɔkwan biara so no, fa wɔn di dwuma.
Or two if he wants.	Anaasɛ abien sɛ ɔpɛ a.
I had to think of something else.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw biribi foforo ho.
Examine each seed carefully.	Hwɛ aba biara mu yiye.
But just a little bit.	Nanso kakra bi kɛkɛ.
I just wanted to know how you were doing today.	Na mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea wo ho te nnɛ ara kwa.
I heard that story.	Metee saa asɛm no.
And it happened a long time ago.	Na esii bere tenten a atwam ni.
This is often the case.	Eyi taa te saa.
We have too much stuff.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma pii dodo.
So something needs to be done about it.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi.
Thank you so much.	Meda wo ase pa ara.
It was a good one.	Ná ɛyɛ nea eye.
Nothing in it, nothing in it.	Biribiara nni mu, biribiara nni mu.
He had a headache.	Ná ne ti ayɛ no yaw.
But that was difficult.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ den.
This was there to be done.	Ná eyi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Except for just one.	Gye biako pɛ.
I have to work tonight.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma anadwo yi.
Hit me up.	Bɔ me so.
I was the only one left.	Ná me nkutoo na aka.
This was going to be a long night for him.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ anadwo tenten ama no.
As if that’s doing something.	Te sɛ nea ɛno reyɛ biribi.
I don't have a house.	Minni fie.
I always say that.	Meka bere nyinaa sɛ.
That was a surprise.	Ná ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
I think everyone enjoyed it.	Misusuw sɛ obiara ani gyee ho.
Some of these items were very expensive.	Ná saa nneɛma yi bi bo yɛ den yiye.
Do not use hot water.	Mfa nsu a ɛyɛ hyew nni dwuma.
He should have just dealt with it now.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ odi ho dwuma ara kwa mprempren.
People were excited.	Ná nkurɔfo ani gye.
But it is by no means easy.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mmerɛw ɔkwan biara so.
It had been going on since she was a girl.	Ná ɛrekɔ so fi bere a na ɔyɛ abeawa no.
But it’s not what people say.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛnea nkurɔfo ka no.
I ask for nothing.	Mesrɛ hwee.
So sorry about that.	Enti kyɛw wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
At least not for humans.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nnipa de.
Only in this way can I move them.	Saa kwan yi so nkutoo na metumi atu wɔn.
About half is nothing.	Bɛyɛ fã nyɛ hwee.
It was my only shot.	Ná ɛno nkutoo ne me tuo.
That’s it, you’ve done it.	Ɛno ne no, wo ayɛ.
This is what happened.	Nea esii ne eyi.
But maybe more of them should.	Nanso ebia ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn mu pii.
Same with the past.	Saa ara nso na nea atwam no.
That’s awesome!	Ɛno yɛ hu!
The problem with this is that his life could be in danger.	Ɔhaw a ɛwɔ eyi mu ne sɛ ne nkwa betumi akɔ asiane mu.
Your mother should be home by now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo maame adu fie mprempren.
Please don’t feed the animals.	Mesrɛ wo, mma mmoa no aduan.
You have something else.	Wowɔ biribi foforo.
Most of them were barefoot.	Ná wɔn mu dodow no ara nni mpaboa.
That was true.	Ná ɛno yɛ nokware.
It was like me.	Ná ɛte sɛ me.
He was an invisible man to most people.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a nnipa dodow no ara nhu no.
But it was definitely him.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛyɛ ɔno.
But this morning.	Nanso anɔpa yi.
No one seems to know the truth.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara nnim nokware no.
This city is famous for its yam.	Saa kurow yi agye din wɔ ne yam ho.
There is something else.	Biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
We will focus on that.	Yɛde yɛn adwene besi saa asɛm no so.
Her apartment was nice enough.	Ná ne dan no mu yɛ fɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He wanted the house.	Ná ɔpɛ ofie no.
Most of that money comes right back to us.	Saa sika no mu dodow no ara san ba yɛn nkyɛn ntɛm ara.
It’s actually pretty cool.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
The picture is a bit late.	Mfonini no aka akyi kakra.
Everyone wants it, but it was imposed on them.	Obiara pɛ, nanso wɔde hyɛɛ wɔn so.
Nothing is fast enough.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ ntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He thought no one else could do it.	Ná osusuw sɛ obi foforo biara ntumi nyɛ.
I can go where you may not.	Metumi akɔ baabi a ebia worentumi nkɔ.
I have no idea what they are, to be honest.	Minni nea wɔyɛ ho adwene biara, sɛ mɛka nokware a.
No information was needed.	Ná nsɛm biara ho nhia.
His playing days were over.	Ná ne nna a ɔde di agoru no aba awiei.
I really feel that way.	Mete nka saa ampa.
The work is not for tomorrow.	Adwuma no nyɛ ɔkyena de.
You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.	Ɛho nhia sɛ woka ho asɛm sɛ wompɛ a.
I will be his wife.	Mɛyɛ ne yere.
Maybe he wasn’t a cop.	Ebia na ɔnyɛ polisifo.
I have been one of the lucky ones.	Mayɛ wɔn a wɔn ani agye no mu biako.
It never happens again.	Ɛnyɛ bio da.
Everyone seems to know everything about everyone else.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara nim obiara ho biribiara.
Our first days were in my bed, in my room.	Ná yɛn nna a edi kan no yɛ me mpa so, wɔ me dan mu.
With a little more effort, he could have saved himself.	Sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden kakra a, anka obetumi agye ne ho.
She was really hot.	Ná ne ho yɛ hyew ankasa.
That’s why he wants her.	Ɛno nti na ɔpɛ no.
He must have been impressed.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na n’ani agye ne ho.
Books seemed to be very expensive.	Ɛte sɛ nea na nhoma bo yɛ den yiye.
It was really quick and easy.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛm na ɛnyɛ den ankasa.
For one thing, this was unnecessary.	Biako ne sɛ na eyi ho nhia.
Many of them had left and gone home.	Ná wɔn mu pii afi hɔ akɔ fie.
He was a human being.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa.
Not that week.	Ɛnyɛ saa dapɛn no.
I don’t know if the person meant anything bad about it.	Me nnim sɛ onipa no kyerɛɛ biribi bɔne wɔ ho.
What is a?.	Dɛn ne a?.
But that doesn’t seem to be possible.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
So that in itself is great.	Enti ɛno ankasa yɛ kɛse.
But this was still difficult for him.	Nanso na eyi da so ara yɛ den ma no.
But consider what he says.	Nanso susuw nea ɔka no ho.
He must be very weak.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
And in bed.	Na wɔ mpa so.
However, it wasn’t easy.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
I have to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
You have to do what you have to do.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
You probably don’t like this, and that’s totally okay.	Ebia w’ani nnye eyi ho, na ɛno nyɛ hwee koraa.
What is your favorite food?	Aduan bɛn na w’ani gye ho paa?
He is within range now.	Ɔwɔ baabi a obetumi akɔ mprempren.
Many people say it is too expensive.	Nnipa pii ka sɛ ne bo yɛ den dodo.
He may be the man you want.	Ebia ɔno ne ɔbarima a wopɛ no.
It certainly wasn’t for me and my wife.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛnyɛ me ne me yere de.
Or he would in two days.	Anaasɛ na ɔbɛyɛ wɔ nna abien akyi.
So he did that.	Enti ɔyɛɛ saa.
Anything we can offer you.	Biribiara a yebetumi de ama wo.
They don’t like it very much.	Wɔn ani nnye ho kɛse.
That’s a lot of different animals.	Ɛno yɛ mmoa ahorow pii.
Look at the picture.	Hwɛ mfonini no.
They just move in a more realistic way.	Wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nokware kɛse so ara kwa.
He was independent.	Ná ɔde ne ho.
Otherwise, not so much.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛnyɛ pii saa.
The food was not good.	Ná aduan no nyɛ papa.
You are also good to me.	Wo nso woyɛ papa ma me.
You don’t have to do anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribiara.
I told everyone.	Meka kyerɛɛ obiara.
All power, all in it.	Tumi nyinaa, ne nyinaa wɔ mu.
But this is not a big problem.	Nanso eyi nyɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
He wasn’t just a man now.	Na ɔnyɛ ɔbarima kɛkɛ mprempren.
However, my mother did not tell me the truth.	Nanso, me maame anka nokware no ankyerɛ me.
There is that he can win.	Ɛwɔ hɔ sɛ obetumi adi nkonim.
It’s not about money at this point.	Ɛnyɛ sika na ɛwɔ saa bere yi mu.
He’s my first child, really.	Ɔno ne me ba a odi kan, ampa.
But that’s great that.	Nanso ɛno yɛ kɛse sɛ.
It was cold outside the house.	Ná awɔw wom wɔ ofie no akyi.
The gun rang loudly.	Tuo no bɔɔ denneennen.
As it is, it is.	Sɛnea ɛte no.
Nothing too exciting here.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ anigye dodo wɔ ha.
Thick clothing kept the cold out.	Ntade a ɛyɛ den maa awɔw no ankɔ mu.
An idea came to him.	Adwene bi baa ne so.
But for him, it was also alcohol.	Nanso wɔ ne fam no, na ɛyɛ nsa nso.
Why should anyone remember this?	Dɛn nti na ɛsɛ sɛ obi kae eyi?
Don't use any of mine.	Mfa me de no biara nni dwuma.
I just don’t like it.	M’ani nnye ho kɛkɛ.
I don't know how this is supposed to work.	Minnim sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma.
Consider! 	Hwɛ!
Something still simple and human’.	Biribi a ɛda so ara yɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ onipa de’.
Check it out here.	Hwɛ ha hɔ.
Good job.	Adwuma pa.
My father has a lot of money.	Me papa wɔ sika pii.
I don’t think anyone really does.	Minsusuw sɛ obiara yɛ saa ankasa.
I made a better home for them.	Mewɔ ofie a eye ma wo.
Show me where he is.	Kyerɛ me baabi a ɔwɔ.
I still remember most of it.	Meda so ara kae dodow no ara.
A strong floor.	Fam a ɛyɛ den.
Maybe that’s how he wants me to feel.	Ebia saa na ɔpɛ sɛ mete nka.
The food here is also great.	Aduan a ɛwɔ ha no nso yɛ kɛse.
It’s not a real animal or anything.	Ɛnyɛ aboa ankasa anaa biribiara.
Many animals migrate from one place to another.	Mmoa pii tu fi baabi kɔ baabi foforo.
But that was never for him.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ mma no da.
This is great, absolutely great.	Eyi yɛ kɛse, ɛyɛ kɛse koraa.
He hoped it was one of the latter two.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛyɛ abien a etwa to no mu biako.
It sounds interesting.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
He doesn’t do bad things.	Ɔnyɛ nneɛma bɔne.
He had incredible manipulation.	Ná ɔwɔ tumi a ɔde ne nsa di dwuma a na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
As a concept.	Sɛ́ adwene bi.
But it is too late.	Nanso aka akyi dodo.
Everyone wants some money!	Obiara pɛ sika bi!
However, that is unlikely to happen.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye sɛ ɛno bɛba.
He seemed to be free.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔde ne ho.
You may feel better.	Ebia wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
It’s too big for him.	Ɛyɛ kɛse dodo ma no.
But there are many more.	Nanso pii wɔ hɔ.
It’s the last one.	Ɛyɛ nea etwa to.
Otherwise, the group will do things that no one else needs.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, kuw no bɛyɛ nneɛma a obiara nhia.
Very quickly.	Ntɛmntɛm yiye.
He shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
It is now inside.	Mprempren ɛwɔ mu.
I don’t know anything about myself.	Minnim me ho hwee.
And it might be a mistake.	Na ebia ɛbɛyɛ mfomso.
We put first things first.	Yɛde nneɛma a edi kan di kan.
They are just words.	Wɔyɛ nsɛm ara kwa.
You have done quite well.	Woayɛ no yiye koraa.
It was a learning curve.	Ná ɛyɛ adesua nhyehyɛe.
He was at a table.	Ná ɔwɔ pon bi so.
The other man's.	Ɔbarima foforo no de.
Their numbers increased.	Wɔn dodow kɔɔ anim.
That’s not a bad thing, in my opinion.	Ɛno nyɛ ade bɔne, wɔ m’adwene mu.
No one is the same.	Obiara nyɛ nea ɛte sɛ nea ɛte no.
Almost the last of the season really.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nea etwa to wɔ bere no mu ankasa.
But they had to do that.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
It was him, too.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔno nso.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.	Ka wo ho asɛm kakra kyerɛ yɛn.
He made up his mind.	Ɔyɛɛ n’adwene.
I don’t know all of them.	Minnim wɔn nyinaa.
Maybe they both liked it.	Ebia wɔn baanu nyinaa ani gyee ho.
Everyone looked at him intently.	Obiara hwɛɛ no ​​denneennen.
Either way, he seems happy.	Ɔkwan biara so no, ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
We were both part of the ruling class.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛ kuw a edi tumi no fã.
Maybe you’ll be interested.	Ebia w’ani begye ho.
Than each other.	Sen wɔn ho wɔn ho.
You can make a great deal of money.	Wubetumi anya sika kɛse bi.
It was not very powerful.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ tumi kɛse.
But it was very, very cold.	Nanso na awɔw wom kɛse paa.
Mine is pretty amazing.	Me de no yɛ fɛ a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He can talk too.	Ɔno nso tumi kasa.
Nothing worked.	Biribiara anyɛ adwuma.
Not for me, never.	Ɛnyɛ me de, ɛnyɛ da.
Follow their interest.	Di wɔn anigye akyi.
The complexity of this task alone is significant.	Sɛnea adwuma yi nkutoo mu yɛ den no yɛ nea ɛho hia.
However, he is wrong.	Nanso, odi mfomso.
Words that make it work.	Nsɛm a wɔka ma ɛyɛ adwuma.
I am very sorry for you.	Mepa wo kyɛw kɛse.
All that you want.	Nea wopɛ nyinaa.
Quite a long time actually.	Bere tenten koraa ankasa.
Don’t go there.	Mma nkɔ hɔ.
But it’s still not what you want.	Nanso ɛda so ara nyɛ nea wopɛ.
And your shorts look really good in the back.	Na wo ntade tiaa no hwɛ yiye ankasa wɔ akyi.
Isn’t it awesome? 	So ɛnyɛ hu?
Certainly not one of us.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ yɛn mu biako.
But even that’s not so bad.	Nanso ɛno mpo nyɛ bɔne saa.
So much power, but so little opportunity.	Tumi pii saa, nanso hokwan kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
You look beautiful today.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ nnɛ.
Water makes people water.	Nsu ma nkurɔfo yɛ nsu.
Maybe that was the idea.	Ebia na ɛno ne adwene no.
I don’t want to tell you different things.	Mempɛ sɛ mɛka nsɛm ahorow akyerɛ wo.
I don't know what the problem is.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ ɔhaw no.
No one really says that.	Obiara nka saa ankasa.
I don’t know when that time will come.	Minnim bere a saa bere no bɛba.
It was too true.	Ná ɛyɛ nokware dodo.
Which is his right.	Nea ɛyɛ ne hokwan.
Was it the same for you?	So na ɛte saa ara wɔ wo fam?
You have to be great, and you have to be happy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ kɛse, na wo nso wowɔ anigye.
The leather is not good.	Aboa nhoma no nyɛ papa.
I am sure he will enjoy this project.	Migye di sɛ n’ani begye saa adwuma yi ho.
That might sound like a good idea at a meeting.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ te sɛ adwene pa wɔ nhyiam bi ase.
Where are your people from?	Ɛhe na wo nkurɔfo fi?
I hope you enjoy them as much as my kids.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye wɔn ho te sɛ me mma no.
So, where does all this trouble come from?	Enti, ɛhe na ɔhaw yi nyinaa fi?
The problem would continue for years.	Ná ɔhaw no bɛkɔ so mfe pii.
He was so good tonight.	Na ɔyɛ papa paa anadwo yi.
If anyone heard something he would do it.	Sɛ obi te biribi a anka ɔbɛyɛ.
It’s bigger than hers.	Ɛyɛ kɛse sen ne de no.
He says that.	Ɔka sɛ.
It wasn’t like him.	Na ɛnte sɛ ɔno.
I think your height is great.	Misusuw sɛ wo tenten yɛ kɛse.
He might even be good.	Ebia ɔbɛyɛ papa mpo.
I am currently not sure where the fault lies.	Mprempren minnim baabi a mfomso no wɔ no yiye.
That was a mistake.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfomso.
I grabbed one of them.	Mede me nsa kaa biako.
You talk about your friends behind their backs.	Woka wo nnamfo ho asɛm wɔ wɔn akyi.
All she wanted was to be happy today.	Nea na ɔpɛ ara ne sɛ n’ani gye nnɛ.
But this returns a lie.	Nanso eyi san de atoro ba.
The cold was intense.	Awɔw no mu yɛɛ den.
There was a party in town.	Ná wɔyɛ apontow bi wɔ kurow no mu.
There were so many people for me.	Ná nnipa pii wɔ hɔ ma me.
You have to do this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi.
She needs a home too.	Ɔno nso hia ofie.
Like a few of them.	Te sɛ wɔn mu kakraa bi.
That means jobs, that means a lot of things.	Ɛno kyerɛ nnwuma, ɛno kyerɛ nneɛma pii.
Which, by the way, he has.	Nea, ɔkwan bi so no, ɔwɔ.
You can enter it as many times as you like.	Wubetumi ahyɛ mu mpɛn dodow biara a wopɛ.
Something must have gone wrong.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ biribi ankɔ yiye.
He has a smooth face.	Ɔwɔ anim a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Maybe one of them had a gun.	Ebia na wɔn mu biako wɔ tuo.
I used to totally do that.	Kan no na meyɛ saa koraa.
I feel for you.	Mete nka ma wo.
Check out the scene.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛte.
This is something you both need to consider.	Eyi yɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ mo baanu susuw ho.
In a year or two, we will be fine.	Afe biako anaa abien akyi no, yɛn ho bɛtɔ yɛn.
He says he doesn’t, but he does.	Ɔka sɛ ɔnyɛ saa, nanso ɔyɛ saa.
So on top of things.	Enti wɔ nneɛma so.
I love this idea.	M’ani gye saa adwene yi ho.
I think you’re right.	Misusuw sɛ woayɛ no yiye.
And that was impossible.	Na na ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Surely this team should be able to do that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ kuw yi tumi yɛ saa.
Maybe you’ll be interested.	Ebia w’ani begye ho.
I am pretty sure we will.	Migye di yiye sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa.
This worked for a while, but not anymore.	Eyi yɛɛ adwuma bere tiaa bi, nanso ɛnyɛ saa bio.
Trust yourself in yourself.	Fa wo ho to wo ho so.
Like this morning.	Te sɛ anɔpa yi.
At the same time awesome, you know.	Bere koro no ara a ɛyɛ hu no, wunim.
Something more like that.	Biribi a ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa kɛse.
Such a thing is possible.	Ade a ɛte saa betumi ayɛ yiye.
You knew they were.	Ná wunim sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Or it was out of date.	Anaasɛ na ne bere atwam.
That was a bad idea.	Ná ɛno yɛ adwene bɔne.
He was right there.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ ara.
So take your time.	Enti gye wo bere.
I had to be quick.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ntɛm.
I understand this.	Mete eyi ase.
I spent hours outside with them.	Me ne wɔn dii nnɔnhwerew pii wɔ abɔnten.
It was still fresh.	Ná ɛda so ara yɛ foforo.
However, there are opportunities.	Nanso, hokwan ahorow wɔ hɔ.
You had to see him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no.
If this fails, school will be used.	Sɛ eyi ankɔ yiye a, wɔde sukuu bedi dwuma.
But the other one.	Nanso biako no.
His absence is mentioned in almost every article.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔka nea onni hɔ no ho asɛm wɔ asɛm biara mu.
He had hope	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso
I should never have gone there.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ da.
I come here from work.	Me ba ha fi adwuma.
He was surprised.	Asɛm no yɛɛ no ​​nwonwa.
All but three of them.	Ne nyinaa gye abiɛsa.
You have a good reputation.	Wowɔ din pa.
This may be possible.	Ebia eyi betumi ayɛ yiye.
But he has to tell you that.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka saa asɛm no kyerɛ wo.
That’s because someone was with me.	Ɛno ne sɛ na obi ka me ho.
I felt for him.	Metee nka ma no.
This was your home.	Ná eyi yɛ wo fie.
There was a police car on the drive.	Ná polisifo kar bi wɔ kar no so.
But it didn’t work.	Nanso anyɛ adwuma.
If you don’t like it, you can pass on.	Sɛ w’ani nnye ho a, wubetumi atwam akɔ.
Like it was once so hot.	Te sɛ nea bere bi na ɛyɛ hyew kɛse.
Our testing process was very difficult.	Ná yɛn sɔhwɛ nhyehyɛe no yɛ den yiye.
The thought freaks me out.	Adwene no ma me ho dwiriw me.
A face that has been around for just too long.	Anim a ɛwɔ hɔ akyɛ dodo ara kwa.
Human nature can do that.	Onipa su betumi ayɛ saa.
They had both tried.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa abɔ mmɔden.
The food was hot.	Ná aduan no yɛ hyew.
No one should come near him.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara bɛn no.
Trouble is the real house.	Ɔhaw ne fie ankasa no.
A new year is just a number.	Afe foforo yɛ dodow bi kɛkɛ.
So anything you tell me doesn’t go far enough.	Enti biribiara a wobɛka akyerɛ me no nkɔ akyiri.
His gaze was amazing.	Ná n’ani a ɔde hwɛ ade no yɛ nwonwa.
It’s beautiful and.	Ɛyɛ fɛ na.
Even they knew where the fun lay.	Ná wɔn mpo nim baabi a anigye no wɔ.
But we have only a short time.	Nanso bere tiaa bi nkutoo na yɛwɔ.
He was a warm-hearted man.	Ná ne ho yɛ hyew.
I didn’t like having nothing to do.	Ná m’ani nnye ho sɛ minni biribiara a menyɛ.
Thus, this case is not well ahead of us on this issue.	Enti, saa asɛm yi nni yɛn anim yiye wɔ saa asɛm yi ho.
Check out the photos below.	Hwɛ mfonini ahorow a ɛwɔ ase ha no.
It’s what you want to do.	Ɛyɛ nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ.
This was his day.	Ná eyi ne ne da.
I am new here.	Meyɛ foforo wɔ ha.
Is that all there is to it?	So ɛno nkutoo?
A book full of stories for children.	Nhoma a nsɛm ahyɛ mu ma ma mmofra.
He didn't want any.	Ná ɔmpɛ biara.
Many of us need to volunteer.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn mu pii tu wɔn ho ma.
He led his team in that direction.	Ɔde ne kuw no kɔɔ saa kwan no so.
Who you have forgotten about.	Nea wo werɛ afi ne ho.
His first paintings were not very successful.	Ne mfonini ahorow a edi kan no antumi anyɛ yiye kɛse.
It costs more now.	Ɛho ka yɛ kɛse mprempren.
This is somewhat like the other problem.	Eyi te sɛ ɔhaw foforo no wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
But that didn’t happen.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na esii.
But know this.	Nanso hu eyi.
The work was difficult and dangerous.	Ná adwuma no ayɛ den na asiane wom.
I don’t know this.	Minnim eyi.
Everything is part of the whole.	Biribiara yɛ ade mũ no nyinaa fã.
I get money.	Me nsa ka sika.
I was, too, at the time.	Ná me nso meyɛ saa, saa bere no.
I put them down.	Mede wɔn too fam.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Mempɛ sɛ meka ho asɛm.
It wasn’t like that.	Ná ɛnte saa.
I’ve always loved animals.	M’ani gye mmoa ho bere nyinaa.
People say the same thing today.	Nkurɔfo ka saa asɛm no ara nnɛ.
Not everyone is as it seems on the surface.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na ɔte sɛnea ɛte wɔ ani so no.
No one liked him.	Ná obi ani nnye no.
Or just weird.	Anaasɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
Or try to.	Anaasɛ bɔ mmɔden sɛ.
This is a huge risk.	Eyi yɛ asiane kɛse.
You can, you know.	Wubetumi, wunim.
No work, no food.	Adwuma biara nni hɔ, aduan biara nni hɔ.
I've done it.	Mayɛ no.
Remove the water from it.	Yi nsu no fi mu.
Use new as sparingly as possible.	Fa foforo di dwuma kakraa bi sɛnea wubetumi.
I was never a child.	Ná menyɛ abofra da.
He shouldn’t have done that, either.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa, nso.
This is no walk in the park.	Eyi nyɛ nantew biara wɔ abɔnten so.
Those things are as bad as sin.	Saa nneɛma no yɛ bɔne te sɛ bɔne.
For most people, that’s pretty obvious.	Wɔ nnipa dodow no ara fam no, ɛno da adi kɛse.
No one seemed to hear a word.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obiara nte asɛm biara.
He was busy from morning till night.	Ná onni adagyew fi anɔpa kosi anadwo.
He didn't care what his mother said.	Ná nea ne maame ka no mfa ne ho.
I don’t like to talk about it.	M’ani nnye ho sɛ mɛka ho asɛm.
Everyone was still on the street.	Ná obiara da so ara wɔ abɔnten so.
There was nothing like biking to work.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ sakre a wɔde kɔ adwuma.
After this opportunity.	Saa hokwan yi akyi.
Like my father.	Te sɛ me papa.
Please if you can help me with this.	Mesrɛ wo sɛ wubetumi aboa me wɔ eyi ho a.
As it happens, the bullet goes.	Bere a ɛrekɔ so no, tuo no kɔ.
I have to say that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ.
I understand it is on the way.	Mete ase sɛ ɛwɔ kwan so.
Or at least part of it.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ne fã bi.
That was a lot of money.	Ná ɛno yɛ sika pii.
He headed down the street.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ abɔnten so.
But trust me on this one.	Nanso gye me di wɔ eyi mu.
And he did so.	Na ɔyɛɛ saa.
There is a road behind my house.	Ɔkwan bi wɔ me fie akyi.
A few times a year.	Mpɛn kakraa bi afe biara.
He glanced at the background.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ akyi nsɛm.
Don't use this yet.	Mfa eyi nni dwuma de besi nnɛ.
Or maybe it will be.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Please believe me.	Mesrɛ wo, gye me di.
You don’t want that.	Wompɛ saa.
I have to put him down tomorrow.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede no to fam ɔkyena.
Kids seemed to like it.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea mmofra ani gye ho.
It’s just not true.	Ɛnyɛ nokware kɛkɛ.
They were real people.	Ná wɔyɛ nnipa ankasa.
Spend time with yourself.	Fa bere ne wo ho di dwuma.
Hope was exciting.	Ná anidaso yɛ anigye.
He has done a good job.	Wayɛ adwuma pa.
I don’t think they can do it on their own.	Minsusuw sɛ wɔn ankasa betumi ayɛ.
I have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
You may enjoy this book.	Ebia w’ani begye nhoma yi ho.
He works on it.	Ɔyɛ adwuma wɔ so.
But as it stands this is not true.	Nanso sɛnea ɛte no eyi nyɛ nokware.
The entrance exam was difficult.	Ná sɔhwɛ a wɔde kɔ sukuu no yɛ den.
He's too young to control it.	Ɔyɛ abofra dodo sɛ obetumi adi so.
It was terrible.	Ná ɛyɛ hu.
That conclusion, however, is irrelevant.	Nanso, saa nsɛm a wɔde baa awiei no ho nhia.
I received a letter a few days ago.	Me nsa kaa krataa bi nna kakraa bi a atwam ni.
I love my room.	M’ani gye me dan ho.
I absolutely know this.	Minim eyi koraa.
He wanted nothing to do with her.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔne no yɛ hwee.
I don’t know much about any of that.	Minnim saa nneɛma no mu biara ho nsɛm pii.
See if you can translate it.	Hwɛ sɛ wubetumi akyerɛ ase anaa.
He knows exactly what had happened.	Onim nea na asi ankasa.
This is a real and important point.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nokware na ɛho hia.
It works, it works.	Ɛyɛ adwuma, ɛyɛ adwuma.
So be careful!	Enti hwɛ yiye!
An intelligent boy.	Abarimaa bi a ɔwɔ nyansa.
You will be surprised how this works.	Sɛnea eyi yɛ adwuma no bɛyɛ wo nwonwa.
That’s not what it is.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea ɛte saa.
There were few things they didn’t like about the city.	Ná nneɛma kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ a wɔn ani nnye ho wɔ kurow no ho.
One needs to get to know him better.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi hu no yiye.
However, I don’t know why.	Nanso, minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
This was a mistake.	Ná eyi yɛ mfomso.
She filmed her first scenes last month.	Ɔyɛɛ ne mfonini ahorow a edi kan no ho sini wɔ ɔsram a etwaam no mu.
It was very painful.	Ná ɛyɛ yaw yiye.
He could go to the police.	Ná obetumi akɔ polisifo nkyɛn.
These people are rare, but when you see one, you know one.	Saa nnipa yi ho yɛ na, nanso sɛ wuhu biako a, wunim biako.
All of this worries me deeply.	Eyi nyinaa haw me kɛse.
But I can say this.	Nanso metumi aka eyi.
Or even half human.	Anaasɛ onipa fã mpo.
You should have talked to him.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no kasa.
He did everything he could for me.	Ɔyɛɛ nea obetumi biara maa me.
No need to show off.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔde wɔn ho kyerɛ.
This will take time and practice.	Eyi begye bere ne adesua.
Nothing came in.	Biribiara amma mu.
And, indeed, it does.	Na, ampa ara, ɛyɛ saa.
But it wasn’t our business.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ yɛn asɛm.
Something had come up at work.	Ná biribi aba adwumam.
What qualities do you have?	Su ahorow bɛn na wowɔ?
Nobody ever said anything about that.	Obiara anka saa asɛm no ho asɛm biara da.
And no one doubts it.	Na obiara nnye ho kyim.
I want this one.	Mepɛ eyi.
That wasn’t possible.	Ná ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
It would be great for everyone else but me.	Ɛbɛyɛ kɛse ama obiara a aka gye me nkutoo.
But this can also just work.	Nanso eyi nso betumi ayɛ adwuma kɛkɛ.
That kid is always underfoot.	Saa abofra no wɔ nan ase bere nyinaa.
I even took him back home.	Mede no mpo san kɔɔ fie.
Who knows where it is.	Hena na onim baabi a ɛwɔ.
The cold was getting worse.	Ná awɔw no mu reyɛ den.
This picture is wrong.	Saa mfonini yi yɛ mfomso.
This thing really works.	Saa ade yi yɛ adwuma ankasa.
I was quite young.	Ná meyɛ abofra koraa.
People were shocked.	Nkurɔfo ho dwiriw wɔn.
It didn’t seem to be.	Ɛte sɛ nea na ɛnyɛ saa.
I don’t want that either.	Me nso mempɛ saa.
He touched my hand.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa me nsa.
So that doesn’t work.	Enti ɛno ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
I have no hope that this will work.	Minni anidaso biara sɛ eyi bɛyɛ adwuma.
I've been using it.	Mede ayɛ adwuma.
I don’t think that’s true.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
I just wanted to talk to you.	Na mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa kɛkɛ.
These shoes are very warm.	Saa mpaboa yi yɛ hyew yiye.
I don’t want to be someone’s mom.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ obi maame.
But that is not our case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ yɛn asɛm no ne saa.
She must be a city girl.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔyɛ kurow no mu abeawa.
He really was the nicest guy.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ sen biara ankasa.
This is the best opportunity you can have.	Eyi ne hokwan a eye sen biara a wubetumi de ayɛ saa.
I told him that you were wonderful in everything.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ woyɛ nwonwa wɔ biribiara mu.
Man or walk.	Onipa anaa nantew.
The first coin.	Sika a edi kan.
The workbook should be used for homework.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde adwuma nhoma no yɛ ofie nnwuma.
This is here, and here and here.	Eyi wɔ ha, ne ha ne ha.
At least he seems to be.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛte sɛ nea ɔte saa.
Here’s how it’s done!	Hwɛ, sɛnea wɔyɛ no ni!
Nor was there anyone.	Saa ara nso na na obiara nni hɔ.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
That was his first mistake.	Ɛno ne ne mfomso a edi kan.
It was soft and cold.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw na na awɔw wom.
Don’t talk to me about it!	Mma wo ne me nka ho asɛm!
He was good in bed.	Ná ɔyɛ papa wɔ mpa so.
And not fast enough.	Na ɛnyɛ ntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
But as time went on, his power grew.	Nanso bere kɔɔ so no, ne tumi no yɛɛ kɛse.
Chill.	Gye w'ani.
I discussed it with him.	Me ne no susuw ho.
They are good enough.	Wɔyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I need to use it more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede di dwuma kɛse.
I want you here with me.	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me wɔ ha.
I can’t figure out what it was.	Me ntumi nhu nea na ɛyɛ.
I have absolutely no idea.	Minni adwene biara koraa.
I don’t want to go inside.	Mempɛ sɛ mekɔ mu.
The work is great for him.	Adwuma no yɛ kɛse ma no.
Perhaps he felt the same way.	Ebia na ɔte nka saa ara.
What kind of dog was that?	Ná ɛno yɛ ɔkraman bɛn?
He loved to drive at night.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛka kar anadwo.
The first story follows.	Asɛm a edi kan no di akyi.
He is very good to me, as is everyone else.	Ɔyɛ me yiye paa, sɛnea obiara yɛ no.
Consider the ending.	Susuw awiei no ho hwɛ.
However, I don’t know that.	Nanso, minnim saa.
We conclude that he does.	Yɛde ba awiei sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I think it will be very difficult.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ den yiye.
He had a lot of work to do.	Ná ɔwɔ adwuma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
This is what you need to do.	Eyi ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
You have to get involved.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu.
It seems simple enough.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He used a fake name.	Ɔde din a ɛnyɛ nokware dii dwuma.
All things can happen in that moment.	Nneɛma nyinaa betumi asi wɔ saa bere no mu.
And it wasn’t just us.	Na ɛnyɛ yɛn ara kwa.
Even the street girl can handle herself.	Abɔnten so abeawa no mpo betumi adi ne ho.
He did most of it.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ ne fã kɛse no ara.
He is a very friendly person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔpɛ nnipa paa.
And that means a lot to me.	Na ɛno kyerɛ pii ma me.
He was perfect.	Ná ɔyɛ pɛ.
You know, you're really nice.	Wunim, wo ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
This time we used a memory test.	Saa bere yi de yɛde sɔhwɛ a wɔde kae ade dii dwuma.
Another year has passed.	Afe foforo atwam.
Save me from this trouble.	Gye me fi ɔhaw yi mu.
I was beautiful.	Ná me ho yɛ fɛ.
Animals travel all the time.	Mmoa tu kwan bere nyinaa.
The boy was gone.	Ná abarimaa no nni hɔ bio.
Our team in our city.	Yɛn kuw a ɛwɔ yɛn kurow no mu.
That seems difficult.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ den.
They are very happy.	Wɔn ani agye yiye.
There was no one on the street.	Ná obiara nni abɔnten so.
That is very important to us.	Ɛno ho hia yɛn paa.
You are doing just fine.	Woreyɛ yiye ara kwa.
Amount.	Sika.
Not in the story.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm no mu.
Children have to leave home at some point.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra fi fie bere bi.
I felt pain.	Metee yaw nka.
That story is about sex.	Saa asɛm no fa nna ho.
There are many interesting things about it.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye pii wɔ ho.
I have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
Clearly, it is not.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
He had nothing to regret at this point.	Ná onni biribiara a ɛsɛ sɛ odi ho yaw wɔ saa bere yi mu.
I’m excited about that.	M’ani agye saa asɛm no ho.
I had to be strong for them.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ den ma wɔn.
That’s almost impossible.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
The car crashed horribly.	Kar no hwee ase wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu so.
So the statement is true.	Enti asɛm a wɔka no yɛ nokware.
You told me to.	Woka kyerɛɛ me.
He knew what it was now.	Ná onim nea ɛyɛ mprempren.
I was fascinated by it.	Ná m’ani gye ho.
It’s a really great game.	Ɛyɛ agoru kɛse ankasa.
I have to sleep.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda.
Let him go.	Ma no nkɔ.
There are some interesting reasons for this.	Nneɛma bi a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
My best friends.	Me nnamfo pa.
You have done well enough.	Woayɛ no yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Don’t say anything.	Nka asɛm biara.
There is a lot of water here!	Nsu pii wɔ ha!
Everyone keeps saying the same thing.	Obiara kɔ so ka asɛm koro no ara.
It wasn’t their story.	Na ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm no.
And it was just beautiful.	Na na ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa.
This is not the case here.	Eyi nte saa wɔ ha.
This was no test.	Ná eyi nyɛ sɔhwɛ biara.
Take a look at yourself.	Fa wo ho yɛ fɛ.
I saw something strange.	Mihuu biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He has been doing this for two years.	Wayɛ eyi mfe abien ni.
So not now, thank you.	Enti ɛnyɛ mprempren, meda wo ase.
There was no mistake.	Mfomso biara amma.
I can’t take it anymore.	Mintumi nnye bio.
Remember when your father did a job?	Wokae bere a wo papa yɛɛ adwuma bi no?
That sounds really good.	Ɛno te sɛ nea eye ankasa.
I would agree with that.	Me ne saa asɛm no bɛyɛ adwene.
It was just there.	Ná ɛwɔ hɔ ara kwa.
This didn’t even seem to be the case.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eyi nyɛ mpo.
Don’t include your name.	Mfa wo din nka ho.
Time was of the essence here.	Ná bere ho hia kɛse wɔ ha.
It’s just too cold outside.	Ɛyɛ awɔw dodo ara kwa wɔ abɔnten.
They’re all gone.	Wɔn nyinaa akɔ.
It was a lot of fun.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
However, money isn’t everything.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ sika ne biribiara.
You have been very busy.	Woayɛ adagyew kɛse.
In some delicate way he had always known about them.	Wɔ ɔkwan bi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw so a na onim wɔn ho asɛm bere nyinaa no.
Something terrible had happened.	Ná biribi a ɛyɛ hu asi.
For most, it was no big deal.	Wɔ dodow no ara fam no, na ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse.
It’s not mine.	Ɛnyɛ me de.
However, he seemed happy.	Nanso, na ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
Make this day as amazing as possible.	Ma da yi nyɛ nwonwa sɛnea wubetumi biara.
A little hope, maybe.	Anidaso kakra, ebia.
This is the case now.	Eyi te saa mprempren.
Many people disagree with this view.	Nnipa pii ne saa adwene yi nyɛ adwene.
It’s what he likes.	Ɛyɛ nea n’ani gye ho.
It is dangerous to go alone.	Ɛyɛ asiane sɛ wo nkutoo bɛkɔ.
Just shot this.	Kɛkɛ na ɔde eyi too tuo.
Either way can work.	Ɔkwan biara so betumi ayɛ adwuma.
And be quick about it.	Na yɛ ntɛm wɔ ho.
We took a big risk.	Yɛde yɛn ho too asiane kɛse mu.
But another problem as well.	Nanso ɔhaw foforo nso.
However, we can go elsewhere.	Nanso, yebetumi akɔ baabi foforo.
Very comfortable bed and room.	Mpa ne dan a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He plays like that.	Ɔbɔ agoru saa.
It was years ago.	Ná ɛyɛ mfe bi a atwam ni.
You got us right.	Wo nyaa yɛn yiye.
The story is never good.	Asɛm no nyɛ papa da.
And that’s true.	Na ɛno yɛ nokware.
I don’t know if that tells us anything.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno kyerɛ yɛn biribi anaa.
And you know me.	Na wunim me.
These systems are not easy to implement.	Saa nhyehyɛe ahorow yi nyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma.
He was with them.	Ná ɔne wɔn wɔ hɔ.
Two others are alive.	Nnipa baanu foforo nso te ase.
But how can this be any good?	Nanso ɔkwan bɛn so na eyi betumi ayɛ papa bi?
Neither, however, did it ever happen.	Nanso, saa ara nso na bere biara anyɛ saa.
This is a very interesting story.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
It’s my hair.	Ɛyɛ me ti nhwi.
He does too much, man.	Ɔyɛ pii dodo, onipa.
That book was interesting.	Ná saa nhoma no yɛ anigye.
For a long time.	Bere tenten bi.
Everything he did.	Biribiara a na ɔyɛ.
I didn’t know him that well.	Ná minnim no yiye saa.
We are in a bedroom.	Yɛwɔ mpa bi so.
If you don’t, everyone can see it.	Sɛ wonyɛ saa a, obiara betumi ahu.
Something will come to you soon.	Biribi bɛba wo nkyɛn nnansa yi ara.
Don't just talk to me, man.	Nka me nkutoo ho asɛm nkyerɛ me, onipa.
It was so many things.	Ná ɛyɛ nneɛma pii saa.
And it will be an interesting thing.	Na ɛbɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye.
Please don’t do it again.	Mesrɛ wo, ɛnyɛ bio.
And yet, it was here.	Na nanso, na ɛwɔ ha.
It’s important to know.	Ɛho hia sɛ wuhu.
You should always accept the money if one is offered.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye sika no bere nyinaa sɛ wɔde bi ma a.
There is only forward movement.	Nneɛma a wɔde kɔ anim nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Many people got involved.	Nnipa pii de wɔn ho hyɛɛ mu.
A very good one maybe.	A eye paa ebia.
This boy's father is famous.	Saa abarimaa yi papa agye din.
This is certainly the case.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi te saa.
But they have to be told.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka.
No one could understand.	Obiara antumi nte ase.
He’s really interested in her.	N’ani gye ne ho ankasa.
But to him, it didn’t matter.	Nanso wɔ ne fam no, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
Their first home, their first child.	Wɔn fie a edi kan, wɔn ba a odi kan.
Anyone with legs knows that.	Obiara a ɔwɔ nan nim saa.
First, it’s a good idea.	Nea edi kan no, ɛyɛ adwene pa.
Just stay there.	Tra hɔ ara kwa.
That’s what we need to do.	Ɛno ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
Play your favorite music.	Bɔ nnwom a w’ani gye ho.
The situation was strange.	Ná tebea no yɛ nwonwa.
He spends hours creating his paintings.	Ɔde nnɔnhwerew pii yɛ ne mfonini ahorow no.
I’m very impressed with that.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho yiye.
It’s absolutely.	Ɛyɛ koraa.
It was such a scary situation for me.	Ná ɛyɛ tebea a ɛyɛ hu saa ma me.
I was always in trouble.	Ná mewɔ ɔhaw mu bere nyinaa.
These old photos are very important to me.	Saa mfonini dedaw yi ho hia me yiye.
The man had made it too hard.	Ná ɔbarima no ama ayɛ den dodo.
After that, everything fell into place.	Ɛno akyi no, biribiara hwee ase.
If it feels good, just do it.	Sɛ ɛte sɛ nea eye a, yɛ no ara kwa.
That was a good offer.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade pa a wɔde ma.
This is not the only one.	Ɛnyɛ eyi nkutoo.
Truth overnight.	Nokware anadwo biako.
He did have a book.	Ná ɔwɔ nhoma bi ampa.
There was so much he could manage.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a obetumi ahwɛ so.
Show it in size.	Kyerɛ no kɛse.
In the meantime, keep it simple.	Saa bere yi nyinaa, hwɛ so ara yɛ mmerɛw.
He was very fond of her.	Ná n’ani gye ne ho paa.
There is nothing you can do about that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Don’t make that face.	Mma wonyɛ saa anim no.
There are many varieties.	Ɛwɔ ahorow pii.
So you can put that into the story.	Enti wubetumi de saa asɛm no ahyɛ asɛm no mu.
It was nothing more than that.	Na ɛnyɛ hwee sɛ ɛno.
He doesn’t like me.	Ɔmpɛ me asɛm.
It wasn’t difficult.	Ná ɛnyɛ den.
This is the same with humans.	Eyi te saa ara wɔ nnipa fam.
However, here we are.	Nanso, ha na yɛwɔ.
Forget any of this ever happening.	Wo werɛ mfi eyi mu biara a asi pɛn.
And maybe no one should tell you what to think.	Na ebia ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara ka nea ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho kyerɛ wo.
He decided to help the dog.	Ɔyɛɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛboa ɔkraman no.
The police had come to the house.	Ná polisifo aba fie hɔ.
But he hoped it would.	Nanso na ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
he says that.	ɔka sɛ.
But do what you have to do.	Nanso yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Tell him it’s me.	Ka kyerɛ no sɛ ɛyɛ me.
Someone got that picture.	Obi nyaa saa mfonini no.
It seemed to be the case.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
But no one noticed.	Nanso obiara anhu.
I don’t know who that could be.	Minnim onii a ɛno betumi ayɛ.
I know that mine has.	Minim sɛ me de no ayɛ saa.
But that is not so true.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ nokware saa.
There was no question of food, no question of anything.	Na aduan ho asɛm biara nni hɔ, biribiara ho asɛm.
There were no windows.	Ná mfɛnsere biara nni hɔ.
I hope one day he might be good at it.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ da bi ebia ɔbɛyɛ obi a onim adwuma yiye wɔ mu.
Nothing to do, nothing to do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ, biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Give yourself that power.	Fa saa tumi no ma wo ho.
Without them, we can’t do that.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ wɔn a, yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
Maybe we can get the police involved then.	Ebia yebetumi ama polisifo de wɔn ho ahyɛ mu saa bere no.
But he doesn’t.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa.
Give it a little thought.	Ma ho susuw ho kakra.
Get rid of them all.	Yi wɔn nyinaa fi hɔ.
He was gone for a long time.	Ná onni hɔ bere tenten.
Happiness is our problem.	Anigye ne yɛn haw.
And he would tell me.	Na na ɔbɛka akyerɛ me.
I did a lot of good things for people.	Meyɛɛ nneɛma pa pii maa nkurɔfo.
No one is happy.	Obiara nni hɔ a n’ani gye.
Spent the weekend in the city.	Ɔde dapɛn awiei no traa kurow no mu.
Keep your eyes on the ground.	Fa w’ani kyerɛ fam.
Your plan is working.	Wo nhyehyɛe no reyɛ adwuma.
His head was down.	Ná ne ti akɔ fam.
He never quite knew why.	Ná onnim nea enti a ɛte saa no yiye da.
Everything you do well, but these things can still happen.	Biribiara a wobɛyɛ no yiye, nanso saa nneɛma yi da so ara betumi asi.
He has so much power.	Ɔwɔ tumi pii saa.
Or maybe you don’t want him to.	Anaasɛ ebia wompɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
There are many different things to accept.	Nneɛma ahorow pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wugye tom.
I could use more.	Ná metumi de pii adi dwuma.
It’s a good plan, he told himself.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe pa, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho.
I hope for the best.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ nea eye sen biara bɛba.
This method is more expensive.	Saa kwan yi bo yɛ den sen saa.
Anything is possible.	Biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye.
He told himself that he would be fine.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ ne ho bɛtɔ no.
He fixed his eyes on hers.	Ɔde n’ani sii ne de no so.
This point is very difficult but very important.	Saa asɛm yi yɛ den yiye nanso ɛho hia yiye.
Are you innocent of your sins?	So wo ho nni asɛm wɔ wo bɔne ho anaa?
Remember, this is a test.	Kae sɛ eyi yɛ sɔhwɛ.
Children cannot play in the park.	Mmofra ntumi nni agoru wɔ abɔnten so.
This way, there is more traffic during peak hours.	Saa kwan yi so no, kar pii fa so wɔ bere a nnipa pii kɔ hɔ no.
But you can quickly see that it is not true.	Nanso wubetumi ahu ntɛm ara sɛ ɛnyɛ nokware.
It’s a great job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
One must be a person who is not.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ onipa a ɔnyɛ saa.
It doesn’t have to be to anyone else’s liking.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea obi foforo biara ani gye ho.
I’m not sure how clear I am.	M’ani nnye sɛnea m’adwene mu da hɔ no ho.
Maybe it’s nothing new.	Ebia ɛnyɛ ade foforo.
But there’s not much time for that.	Nanso bere pii nni hɔ ma ɛno.
The movie just has that kind of atmosphere.	Sini no wɔ tebea a ɛte saa ara kwa.
You can’t do anything.	Worentumi nyɛ biribiara.
I really enjoyed it.	Ná m’ani gye ho ankasa.
You go too, too.	Wo nso kɔ.
But thank you, guys.	Nanso meda wo ase.
It’s the most important meal of your day.	Ɛyɛ aduan a ɛho hia sen biara wɔ wo da no mu.
It wasn’t the best day, but it wasn’t terrible.	Ná ɛnyɛ da a eye sen biara, nanso na ɛnyɛ hu.
It’s not about resources.	Ɛnyɛ nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma ho asɛm.
It may sound simple, but it’s not.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw, nanso ɛnte saa.
Don’t let these people get you down.	Mma saa nkurɔfo yi mfa wo nkɔ fam.
He glanced out the window.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
Walk with your feet.	Fa wo nan ase nantew.
For the test test.	Wɔ sɔhwɛ sɔhwɛ no ho.
The same is true of us.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ yɛn fam.
They are interested in	Wɔn ani gye ho sɛ .
He obviously didn’t like me.	Ɛda adi sɛ na n’ani nnye me ho.
He plays the game hard.	Ɔbɔ agoru no denneennen.
That makes him very human.	Ɛno ma ɔyɛ onipa paa.
His team won.	Ne kuw no dii nkonim.
I couldn’t play.	Ná mintumi nni agoru.
We enjoyed our stay.	Yɛn ani gyee yɛn tra no ho.
I just get the money.	Me nsa ka sika no ara kwa.
He is young but he has money.	Ɔyɛ abofra nanso ɔwɔ sika.
Something just happened, and he wanted to tell me.	Biribi sii ara kwa, na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ me.
I have something to do.	Mewɔ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
I wanted to work less.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma kakraa bi.
It was absolutely fascinating.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye koraa.
He works extremely well.	Ɔyɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
Put on your best clothes.	Hyɛ wo ntade a eye sen biara.
It’s a long one.	Ɛyɛ tenten bi.
So very much alive.	Enti nkwa mu paa.
This is a terrible mistake.	Eyi yɛ mfomso a ɛyɛ hu.
There is no time.	Bere biara nni hɔ.
I know more than you do.	Minim pii sen wo.
What a wonderful story!	Asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni!
But it doesn’t just work.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma kɛkɛ.
But this obviously didn’t work.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ eyi anyɛ yiye.
That’s what it was supposed to be.	Saa na na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
This home has an interesting floor plan.	Saa ofie yi wɔ fam nhyehyɛe a ɛyɛ anigye.
It’s an exciting time.	Ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ anigye.
At least it doesn’t matter to me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ hwee wɔ me fam.
This study is a retrospective project.	Saa adesua yi yɛ adwuma a wɔde hwɛ nneɛma a atwam.
So, it wasn’t just about money.	Enti, na ɛnyɛ sika nkutoo ho asɛm.
Something very terrifying.	Biribi a ɛyɛ hu yiye.
They never forget, even if you do.	Wɔn werɛ mfi da, sɛ woyɛ saa mpo a.
I really want her to be happy.	Mepɛ sɛ n’ani gye ampa.
That’s when things started to get interesting.	Ɛno na nneɛma fii ase yɛɛ anigye.
Even if you said it was okay.	Sɛ wokae sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee mpo a.
These days, it’s definitely one phone.	Nna yi, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ telefon biako.
This is easier than it sounds.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw sen sɛnea ɛte no.
I’ve made up my mind.	Mayɛ m’adwene.
That look in their eyes.	Saa hwɛ a ɛwɔ wɔn ani so no.
But that day is long over.	Nanso saa da no aba awiei akyɛ.
They were part of a group.	Ná wɔka kuw bi ho.
Anything, anything, that’s what we’re here for.	Biribiara, biribiara, ɛno ne nea yɛwɔ ha ma.
If he does, that will be it.	Sɛ ɔyɛ saa a, ɛno bɛyɛ saa.
The same goes for phones.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ telefon ahorow ho.
I didn’t know that.	Ná minnim saa.
Who lives here?	Hena na ɔte ha?
There was absolutely nothing to do then.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ koraa saa bere no.
The same is true of us.	Saa ara na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa.
It was about midnight.	Ná ɛyɛ bɛyɛ anadwo fã.
I wanted to tell him about his name.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka no fa ne din ho.
He became stronger again.	Ɔyɛɛ den bio.
This room is beautiful.	Saa dan yi yɛ fɛ.
However, it doesn’t last long.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ bere tenten.
And you may be doing so.	Na ebia woreyɛ saa.
Overall, our stay has been wonderful.	Wɔ ne nyinaa mu no, yɛn tra no ayɛ nwonwa.
Even then you could see something.	Saa bere no mpo na wubetumi ahu biribi.
You may spend a lot of time planning.	Ebia wo na wode bere pii bɛyɛ nhyehyɛe.
There is nothing he does not know now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a mprempren onnim.
It was just evil.	Ná ɛyɛ bɔne ara kwa.
They were looking out for each other.	Ná wɔn ani da wɔn ho wɔn ho so.
Let that be the case.	Ma ɛno yɛ saa.
It’s almost invisible to me now.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea mintumi nhu mprempren.
But there are many positive results.	Nanso nneɛma pa pii fi mu ba.
This statement is not true.	Saa asɛm yi nyɛ nokware.
And in the water.	Na nsu no mu.
Everyone around him was also in danger.	Ná obiara a ɔne no wɔ hɔ no nso wɔ asiane mu.
I know he does.	Minim sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Hope you can do it this way again.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi ayɛ no saa kwan yi so bio.
Or at least he does for only a short time.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɔyɛ saa bere tiaa bi pɛ.
There was definitely something wrong here.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na mfomso bi wɔ ha.
If you were offered this money, what would you do?	Sɛ wɔde sika yi ma wo a, dɛn na wobɛyɛ?
So you don’t like them.	Enti w’ani nnye wɔn ho.
We held hands in the water.	Yɛde yɛn nsa bɔɔ mu wɔ nsu no mu.
His eyes fixed on hers.	N’ani kyerɛɛ ne de no so.
And everyone here agrees.	Na obiara a ɔwɔ ha no gye tom.
At least I thank you now.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, meda wo ase mprempren.
Please, please.	Mesrɛ mo.
I can't have him there today.	Mintumi nnya no wɔ hɔ nnɛ.
Every single book.	Nhoma biako biara.
It was the same in school for me.	Saa ara na na ɛte wɔ sukuu mu ma me.
He was also a troublemaker.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔde ɔhaw ba nso.
I think it’s a little bit mental.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ adwene mu kakra.
I think we can do that.	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi ayɛ saa.
I’m interested in a lot of things.	M’ani gye nneɛma pii ho.
That is very obvious.	Ɛno da adi yiye.
I wanted to do it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ.
He focused on her.	Ɔde n’adwene sii ne so.
Water has been our most important resource.	Nsu ayɛ yɛn ade a ɛho hia sen biara.
There should be more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ pii ka ho.
Look at used clothes.	Hwɛ ntade a wɔde adi dwuma.
I was just a boy.	Ná meyɛ abarimaa bi kɛkɛ.
Do nothing or close the door.	Mma wonyɛ hwee anaasɛ to ɔpon no mu.
This would cause the person to make a passive decision.	Ná eyi bɛma onipa no asi gyinae bi a ɔnyɛ hwee.
I know that wasn’t what you meant.	Minim sɛ na ɛnyɛ nea wopɛ sɛ woka.
There was no one there.	Na obiara nni hɔ.
You need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
It was much, much more.	Ná ɛyɛ pii, pii sen saa.
Or something like that.	Anaasɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
A what is that.	A dɛn na sɛ.
They are very beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
We all wear clothes.	Yɛn nyinaa hyɛ ntade.
But you don’t have to.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
It was amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa.
And it wasn’t his.	Na ɛnyɛ ne de.
But if absolutely necessary, I will.	Nanso sɛ ɛho hia koraa a, mɛyɛ saa.
A week ago it was.	Dapɛn biako a atwam ni.
Let me think about this a little more.	Ma minsusuw eyi ho kakra bio.
He ran to the door.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ ɔpon no ano.
However, this is not the end of the story.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ eyi na asɛm no ba awiei.
He had no last name.	Ná onni din a etwa to.
One of them stepped to his side.	Wɔn mu biako de ne nan sii ne nkyɛn.
He wanted to be quick.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ntɛm.
That is no longer there.	Ɛno nni hɔ bio.
Again, this is not surprising.	Bio nso, eyi nyɛ nwonwa.
He could have won it.	Anka obetumi adi so nkonim.
Think about how far things have come in a short period of time.	Susuw baabi a nneɛma akɔ akyiri wɔ bere tiaa bi mu no ho hwɛ.
But there was more to it than that.	Nanso na pii wɔ ho sen saa.
Wear a nice dress.	Hyɛ atade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
And it’s kind of weird.	Na ɛyɛ ɔkwan bi so a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
The larger one.	Nea ɛyɛ kɛse no.
They didn’t have to.	Na enhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Look at what he’s done.	Hwɛ nea wayɛ.
Something was going to work out.	Ná biribi bɛkɔ yiye.
I'm only there for a few days.	Mewɔ hɔ nna kakraa bi kɛkɛ.
That only compounds the problem.	Ɛno ma ɔhaw no yɛ kɛse ara kwa.
Maybe a little bit.	Ebia kakra bi.
She was his mother.	Ná ɔyɛ ne maame.
I don’t have a girlfriend.	Minni abeawa biara.
I am sure he will enjoy it.	Migye di sɛ n’ani begye ho.
There is no real fruit.	Aba ankasa biara nni hɔ.
We have a chapter here.	Yɛwɔ ti wɔ ha.
There has to be a better way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ.
Most people agree that sleeping is dangerous.	Nnipa dodow no ara gye tom sɛ sɛ obi nna a, asiane wom.
The course is the first of its kind.	Adesua no ne nea edi kan wɔ ne su mu.
This man didn’t.	Saa ɔbarima yi anyɛ saa.
And he wanted to.	Na na ɔpɛ.
I have to do what I am told to do.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nea wɔka kyerɛ me sɛ menyɛ no.
You are the strong one.	Wo na woyɛ den.
Just what that meant, he didn't know.	Nea ɛno kyerɛ ankasa no, na onnim.
I have a better idea.	Mewɔ adwene a eye sen saa.
This is something we all have.	Eyi yɛ biribi a yɛn nyinaa wɔ.
That may sound strange.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It is common in complex systems.	Ɛyɛ ade a abu so wɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow a ɛyɛ den mu.
I don’t know why he did this, but it felt really good.	Minnim nea enti a ɔyɛɛ eyi, nanso na ɛte sɛ nea eye ankasa.
He began to believe himself.	Ɔno ankasa fii ase gye dii.
I have been a part of many.	Mayɛ nnipa pii fã.
Their clothes were wet.	Ná wɔn ntade ayɛ nsu.
I have the right to everything.	Mewɔ biribiara ho kwan.
It was also inexpensive.	Na ɛyɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den nso.
It’s not new, but it’s not really old either.	Ɛnyɛ ade foforo, nanso ɛnyɛ dedaw ankasa nso.
Or doing the new thing.	Anaasɛ ade foforo no a wobɛyɛ.
He doesn’t seem to be.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔnyɛ saa.
As in this very moment.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ saa bere yi ara mu no.
That’s something that’s already happening.	Ɛno yɛ biribi a ɛrekɔ so dedaw.
I can’t think of any other.	Mintumi nsusuw foforo biara ho.
Not really for kids.	Ɛnyɛ mmofra de ankasa.
One day an idea came to him.	Da koro bi adwene bi baa ne so.
I should have seen him before.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no pɛn.
None of that matters.	Ɛno mu biara ho nhia.
We need to do something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ biribi.
And he knew where he lived, too.	Na na onim baabi a ɔte, nso.
Everyone wants money.	Obiara pɛ sika.
To find out more, check here.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ wuhu pii a, hwɛ wɔ ha.
I know my hair.	Minim me ti nhwi.
But apparently, it has.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ, aba.
However, none of this really means anything.	Nanso, eyi mu biara nkyerɛ hwee ankasa.
The gesture doesn’t mean much.	Nsa a wɔde kyerɛ no nkyerɛ pii.
I can believe that.	Metumi agye saa asɛm no adi.
So in a way.	Enti ɔkwan bi so.
But that’s not the point.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
Please tell me you can have a dog.	Mesrɛ wo ka kyerɛ me sɛ wubetumi anya ɔkraman.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.

She blinked at him excitedly.	Ɔde anigye bɔɔ n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
This is what he wanted.	Eyi ne nea na ɔpɛ.
There is nothing you cannot have.	Biribiara nni hɔ a worentumi nnya.

But it didn’t matter.	Nanso anyɛ hwee.

The boy looked out the window.	Abarimaa no hwɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
Both will continue to play great.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa bɛkɔ so adi agoru kɛse.
This is all I will add.	Eyi nkutoo na mede bɛka ho.
And your people are my help.	Na wo nkurɔfo yɛ me mmoa.
For the first method.	Wɔ ɔkwan a edi kan no ho.
Work all week and stay home on weekends.	Yɛ adwuma dapɛn mũ no nyinaa na tra fie dapɛn awiei.
Much to do.	Pii a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
How perfect he was in every way.	Hwɛ sɛnea na ɔyɛ pɛ wɔ biribiara mu.
The film is important for a number of reasons.	Nneɛma ahorow bi nti na sini no ho hia.
Whether it’s good or bad.	Sɛ ɛyɛ papa anaa bɔne.
It must be the problem.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔhaw no.
But it was terrible.	Nanso na ɛyɛ hu.
Half this amount for one or two people.	Yɛ saa dodow yi fã ma onipa biako anaa baanu.
That was the way it was.	Saa na na ɛte.
In one sense, there is no doubt.	Wɔ ɔkwan biako so no, akyinnye biara nni ho.
Thank you for everything.	Meda wo ase wɔ biribiara ho.
You know me better than that, anyway.	Wunim me yiye sen saa, ɔkwan biara so.
Isn’t he a happy person?	So ɔnyɛ obi a ɔwɔ anigye?
He always thought he would be a boy.	Ná osusuw sɛ ɔbɛyɛ abarimaa bere nyinaa.
It seemed that	Ná ɛte sɛ nea .
I believe, like me.	Migye di, te sɛ me.
He is the one who controls it.	Ɔno na odi so.
It just exists.	Ɛwɔ hɔ ara kwa.
I don’t know what it is.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ.
Maybe there is an opportunity.	Ebia hokwan bi wɔ hɔ.
So we can have our own home.	Enti yebetumi anya yɛn ankasa fie.
However, it may be that good.	Nanso, ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa saa.
Risk management is something we all deal with.	Asiane ho nhyehyɛe yɛ biribi a yɛn nyinaa di ho dwuma.
It’s a beautiful face.	Ɛyɛ anim a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I don’t think he had much.	Minsusuw sɛ na ɔwɔ pii.
He hasn’t been the same dog since.	Ɔnyɛ ɔkraman koro no ara fi saa bere no.
If it works for them .	Sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma ma wɔn a .
You seem to be the only thing.	Ɛte sɛ nea wo nkutoo ne ade a ɛwɔ hɔ.
But this is it.	Nanso eyi ne no.
The book is richly illustrated.	Nhoma no wɔ mfonini ahorow pii.
This shouldn’t be surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa.
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.	Minnim nea mereyɛ bɔne.
The girl’s mother is a sex worker.	Abeawa no maame yɛ obi a ɔyɛ nna ho adwuma.
Everyone was afraid.	Ná obiara suro.
It sounds really weird.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
These people are brilliant.	Saa nkurɔfo yi yɛ nnipa a wɔn ho akokwaw.
And there’s that story again.	Na saa asɛm no wɔ hɔ bio.
To get into the bedroom with him.	Sɛ ɔne no bɛkɔ mpa no mu.
I want him to feel my pain.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔte me yaw no nka.
But his father was right.	Nanso na ne papa asɛm no yɛ nokware.
Take them on a long walk.	Fa wɔn kɔ nantew tenten bi so.
And so do you, by the way.	Na saa ara na wo nso, ɔkwan bi so no.
A whole day is a busy time.	Da mũ nyinaa yɛ bere a nnipa pii kɔ hɔ.
It seems to have worked.	Ɛte sɛ nea ayɛ adwuma.
But just do your best.	Nanso yɛ nea wubetumi biara kɛkɛ.
This has been happening today.	Eyi akɔ so nnɛ.

Someone with a gun.	Obi a ɔwɔ tuo.
Every time, there was a problem.	Bere biara, na ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
Thank you again!.	Meda wo ase bio!.
And this is only half the story.	Na eyi yɛ asɛm no fã pɛ.
I'm going to tell you the truth.	Me deɛ, mɛka nokware akyerɛ wo.
That’s just my opinion.	Ɛno ne m’adwene ara kwa.
In such a big way too soon.	Wɔ ɔkwan kɛse a ɛte saa so ntɛm dodo.
Maybe you can do it right.	Ebia wubetumi ayɛ no yiye.
I have to go now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ mprempren.
Everyone has a story, this is just part of yours.	Obiara wɔ asɛm bi, eyi yɛ wo de no fã bi kɛkɛ.
Everything was true.	Ná asɛm biara yɛ nokware.
I was part of that.	Ná meyɛ saa asɛm no fã.
He talks about that.	Ɔka saa asɛm no ho asɛm.
You know what time is like for kids.	Wunim sɛnea bere yɛ ma mmofra.
He looked away.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ baabi foforo.
That was a bad job.	Ná ɛno yɛ adwuma bɔne.
Not now, not yet.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren, ɛnyɛ de besi nnɛ.
I wanted to keep going.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so.
A couple of times since then.	Mpɛn abien bi fi saa bere no.
Have the books arrived?	So nhoma ahorow no aba?
It just isn’t that.	Ɛnyɛ saa ara kwa.
That’s a good thing.	Ɛno yɛ nea eye.
He didn't know what it was like.	Ná onnim sɛnea ɛte.
You have to sign it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo nsa hyɛ ase.
I don't really have that much money available.	Minni sika pii a ɛwɔ hɔ saa ankasa.
I didn’t even have a name.	Ná minni din mpo.
Expensive shoes are popular.	Mpaboa a ne bo yɛ den yɛ ade a nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
Prices did not fall again.	Nneɛma bo ankɔ fam bio.
It’s really amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
However, they are by no means alone.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ wɔn nkutoo na wɔyɛ saa ɔkwan biara so.
Manufacturing in a city	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ wɔ kurow bi mu
We should have introduced it a year ago.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde ba mfe biako a atwam ni.
I had no idea where he might be.	Ná minni baabi a ebia ɔwɔ ho adwene biara.
Doing things like a normal person.	Nneɛma a wobɛyɛ te sɛ obi a ɔte ase.
He absolutely had to.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa koraa.
No surprise there perhaps.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa wɔ hɔ ebia.
He never had to.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa da.
It was a thing of the past.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a atwam.
Not everyone was so lucky.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na na ɔwɔ anigye saa.
But he wasn’t brilliant.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho akokwaw.
Which is perfect.	Nea ɛyɛ pɛ.
For years, it was the only game in town.	Mfe pii no, na ɛno nkutoo ne agoru a ɛwɔ kurow no mu.
It was brand new.	Ná ɛyɛ foforo koraa.
I just want him to be a normal kid.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ abofra a ɔte ase ara kwa.
I’m not here, you know.	M’ani nnye ho wɔ ha, wunim.
He is there in front of us a lot of the time.	Ɔwɔ hɔ wɔ yɛn anim bere pii.
Always be honest.	Di nokware bere nyinaa.
Tomorrow will almost certainly be hot.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔkyena bɛyɛ hyew.
I don’t know much about him.	Minnim ne ho nsɛm pii.
I think it will work.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
Whether you knew it or not.	Sɛ́ ebia na wunim anaasɛ wunnim no.
It is not so.	Ɛnte saa.
There was one other man and his wife.	Ná ɔbarima foforo biako ne ne yere wɔ hɔ.
He was in a good mood today.	Ná ɔwɔ adwene pa nnɛ.
I put my trust in him.	Mede me ho too ne so.
If not, forget it.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ma wo werɛ mfi.
He obviously didn’t know what to do.	Ɛda adi sɛ na onnim nea ɔnyɛ.
I can absolutely tell you, it is not.	Metumi aka akyerɛ wo koraa sɛ, ɛnte saa.
Your mother was actively involved.	Wo maame de wo ho hyɛɛ mu denneennen.
There is no time like the present.	Bere biara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ mprempren de no.
We can’t tell.	Yɛrentumi nhu.
You definitely put a lot of time into this.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wode bere pii sii eyi so.
They are not surprised.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn nwonwa.
But I do that.	Nanso meyɛ saa.
Get to know this person a little better.	Hu onipa yi yiye kakra.
Or he could have .	Anaasɛ na obetumi ayɛ .
Age will determine that.	Mfe a obi adi na ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Maybe immediately, maybe within a year.	Ebia ntɛm ara, ebia afe biako mu.
Are you sure you want to know this?	So wugye di sɛ wopɛ sɛ wuhu eyi?
Apparently it is again.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛte saa bio.
It works really well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
But the price remained the same.	Nanso bo no kɔɔ so yɛɛ pɛ.
He was very professional.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a onim adwuma yiye paa.
He is just one awesome kid.	Ɔyɛ abofra biako pɛ a ne ho yɛ hu.
I know, too easy again.	Minim, ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo bio.
He touched her hand.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne nsa.
He slid his hands over it.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ so.
Please, tell me.	Mesrɛ wo, ka.
Again, that’s me.	Bio nso, ɛno ne me.
This doesn’t matter to them.	Eyi mfa wɔn ho.

Anyone can suggest an idea.	Obiara betumi de adwene bi ahyɛ nyansa.
Thank you so much!.	Meda wo ase pa ara!.
But there may be other ideas.	Nanso adwene foforo nso betumi aba.

They don’t seem to care.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm.
And it was amazing, too.	Na ɛyɛ nwonwa nso.
Mine car.	Minni kar.
I can’t even begin to imagine how difficult that must have been.	Mintumi mfi ase mpo nsusuw sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛno yɛ den no ho.
The next night, the same.	Anadwo a edi hɔ no, saa ara.
Or at least he used to be.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, kan no na ɔte saa.
But it didn’t matter.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ no asɛm.
And that’s all there is to it.	Na ɛno ara ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ.
Even taking the kids with them.	Mmofra no a wɔde wɔn bɛka wɔn ho mpo.
Man, this costs.	Onipa, eyi ka.
It had been for years.	Ná ayɛ mfe pii.
He takes her for long walks.	Ɔde no kɔ nantew tenten.
He must have come to his senses.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ n’adwene baa ne ho so.
I'm surprised he knows my name.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa sɛ onim me din.
You are half my age.	Woyɛ me mfe fã.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani gye ho ankasa.
I just couldn’t imagine them any other way.	Na mintumi nsusuw wɔn ho ɔkwan foforo biara so kɛkɛ.
Many of them.	Wɔn mu pii.
We really enjoyed the room.	Yɛn ani gyee dan no ho ankasa.
Our food is too expensive.	Yɛn aduan bo yɛ den dodo.
No one at the parties seemed to know anything.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obiara nni apontow ahorow no ase a onim hwee.
It was extremely easy to use.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma.
This time, she looks amazing.	Saa bere yi de, ne ho yɛ nwonwa.
That’s a long story.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm tenten bi.

I wanted to do it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ.
Tell me anything he says to you.	Ka asɛm biara a ɔka kyerɛ wo no kyerɛ me.
They both talked about it.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa kaa ho asɛm.
Everything had to be done right.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribiara yiye.

My mother lived here.	Ná me maame te ha.
It’s just a necessary condition.	Ɛyɛ tebea a ɛho hia ara kwa.
Lots of fun.	Anigye pii.
We had water then.	Ná yɛwɔ nsu saa bere no.
That boy has a really awesome mind.	Saa abarimaa no wɔ adwene a ɛyɛ hu ankasa.
It felt like hours.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte sɛ nnɔnhwerew pii.
However, very few people use it.	Nanso, nnipa kakraa bi pɛ na wɔde di dwuma.
Here is the big problem.	Ɔhaw kɛse no ni.

Most come empty.	Dodow no ara ba a hwee nni mu.
That wasn’t good enough.	Ná ɛno nyɛ papa.
Remove the head if desired.	Yi ti no sɛ wopɛ a.
Just do it.	Yɛ kɛkɛ.
That alone casts doubt on that study.	Ɛno nkutoo gye saa adesua no ho kyim.
At least not that he knew.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nea na onim.
It was still them.	Ná ɛda so ara yɛ wɔn.
You can say anything.	Wubetumi aka biribiara.
The police reaction was obvious.	Ná sɛnea polisifo yɛɛ wɔn ade no da adi.
I care about my dog.	Me kraman ho hia me.
Do this for the perfect duration.	Yɛ eyi ma bere tenten a edi mũ.

You will tell me anyway.	Wobɛka akyerɛ me ɔkwan biara so.
He is always on the bike.	Ɔte sakre no so bere nyinaa.
That doesn’t really help.	Ɛno ntumi mmoa ankasa.

What’s the big deal? 	Dɛn ne asɛm kɛse no?

Don’t be afraid of yourself.	Mma w’ani nnye wo ho.

This time, he talked to us about it.	Saa bere yi de, ɔne yɛn kaa ho asɛm.
The highway is full of cars.	Kar ahyɛ ɔkwan kɛse no so ma.

Always do things for him.	Yɛ nneɛma ma no bere nyinaa.

There is no problem here.	Ɔhaw biara nni ha.
He gave her everything.	Ɔde biribiara maa no.

And in a way, it isn’t.	Na ɔkwan bi so no, ɛnte saa.
Get to know him better.	Hu no yiye.
Its the most important moment.	Ne bere a ɛho hia sen biara.
It’s still your child.	Ɛda so ara yɛ wo ba no.
You can find it today.	Wubetumi ahu no nnɛ.

Three things happened today.	Nneɛma abiɛsa sii nnɛ.

Never lose sight of the road.	Mma w’ani mfi kwan so da.

Being a very good mom or dad is often hard.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ maame anaa papa pa paa.

Nevertheless, they do it each and every time.	Ne nyinaa mu no, wɔyɛ no bere biara ne bere biara.

The story wasn’t surprising.	Asɛm no anyɛ nwonwa.
Look where my new home is.	Hwɛ baabi a me fie foforo no wɔ.
But do something.	Nanso yɛ biribi.
It was one of those days.	Ná ɛyɛ saa nna no mu biako.
This is the end of the dry season.	Eyi ne ɔpɛ bere no awiei.

However, these issues present several immediate problems.	Nanso, saa nsɛm yi de ɔhaw ahorow pii ba ntɛm ara.
His house is on the edge of town.	Ne fie wɔ kurow no ano.
No one likes the past.	Obiara ani nnye nneɛma a atwam ho.
It’s something you either do or don’t do.	Ɛyɛ biribi a woyɛ anaasɛ wonyɛ.
He didn't want to do anything.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribiara.
That’s why you had to take it from him.	Ɛno nti na na ɛsɛ sɛ wugye fi ne hɔ no.

He glanced out the window.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
I was taken somewhere.	Wɔde me kɔɔ baabi.
If you are here.	Sɛ wowɔ ha a.
This has caused some problems.	Eyi de ɔhaw ahorow bi aba.
It’s a human being.	Ɛyɛ onipa.
That is a matter of perspective.	Ɛno yɛ adwene mu asɛm.
No one else could.	Obi foforo biara antumi anyɛ saa.
The story of the film is a breathtaking one.	Sini no mu asɛm no yɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
At least it seemed older.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte sɛ nea akyɛ.
I am not surprised at all.	Ɛnyɛ me nwonwa koraa.
Every story is in the first person.	Asɛm biara wɔ onipa a odi kan no mu.
And that’s what you’ve done.	Na ɛno ne nea woayɛ.
It’s so hot!	Ɛyɛ hyew yiye!
The same goes for the same people every month.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nnipa koro no ara ho ɔsram biara.
No one goes inside.	Obiara nkɔ mu.
Give him a chance.	Ma no kwan.
He worries about who does the most work.	Ɔhaw ne ho sɛ hena na ɔyɛ adwuma kɛse.
And it wasn’t.	Na ɛnyɛ saa.
If so, it would be a very poor city.	Sɛ ɛte saa a, anka ɛbɛyɛ kurow a odi hia paa.
Everything people gave to each other in such a time.	Biribiara a nkurɔfo de maa wɔn ho wɔn ho wɔ bere a ɛte saa mu no.
I believe too much in this group.	Migye di dodo wɔ saa kuw yi mu.
The easiest money anyone down here has ever seen.	Sika a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sen obiara a ɔwɔ fam ha ahu pɛn.
You’ve done everything.	Woayɛ biribiara.
It is true that people are troubled.	Ɛyɛ nokware sɛ nkurɔfo haw.
Maybe what you say is true.	Ebia nea woka no yɛ nokware.
Maybe you were at work.	Ebia na wowɔ adwumam.
What you said was very painful.	Nea wokae no yɛɛ yaw paa.
You are not alone in this.	Ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo na wowɔ eyi mu.
I didn’t know what it was.	Ná minnim nea ɛyɛ.
It is the work of two people.	Ɛyɛ nnipa baanu adwuma.
I don't have money.	Minni sika.
This life goes to all people, as well as animals.	Saa nkwa yi kɔ nnipa nyinaa nkyɛn, ne mmoa nso.
I was always awake.	Ná meda hɔ bere nyinaa.
He's doing that a lot.	Ɔreyɛ saa kɛse.
No one should be afraid.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara suro.
I know he knows.	Minim sɛ onim.
It was a short walk.	Ná ɛyɛ nantew tiaa bi.
If we have to do that.	Sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa a.
Just walked out.	Nantew fii adi kɛkɛ.
That’s pretty much the point.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
It seemed okay to him.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ hwee ma no.
But like you said, you don’t want this.	Nanso sɛnea wokae no, wompɛ eyi.
We had a wonderful idea.	Ná yɛwɔ adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Please, please, please.	Mesrɛ wo, mesrɛ wo, mesrɛ wo.
People need to know they matter.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo hu sɛ wɔn ho hia.
The problem is internal.	Ɔhaw no yɛ nea ɛwɔ mu.
It’s his own.	Ɛyɛ ne de.
I had to work out how.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ sɛnea wɔyɛ no ho adwuma.
It’s such a disaster!	Ɛyɛ asiane a ɛte saa!
The system is there.	Nhyehyɛe no wɔ hɔ.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
You can’t help me.	Worentumi mmoa me.
That was from his point of view.	Ná ɛno fi n’adwene mu.
The course was too long for him.	Ná adesua no tenten dodo ma no.
Pretty good enough for me.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ ma me.
I don’t know what’s on the other side of the water.	Minnim nea ɛwɔ nsu no fã foforo.
It’s not a hard face and it’s not easy.	Ɛnyɛ anim a ɛyɛ den na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
I think you are doing a fantastic job.	Misusuw sɛ woreyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
The team immediately got to work.	Kuw no fii ase yɛɛ adwuma ntɛm ara.
This in itself was significant.	Ná eyi ankasa yɛ nea ɛho hia.
Animal continues to lead game in danger.	Aboa kɔ so di agoru anim wɔ asiane mu.
This is on them, not us.	Eyi wɔ wɔn so, ɛnyɛ yɛn so.
It’s not that I’m not hard on myself.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ menyɛ den wɔ me ho.
He sounds like he wants to say more.	Ɔte sɛ nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka pii.
But ultimately, a plan for real action.	Nanso awiei koraa no, nhyehyɛe a wɔde bɛyɛ ade ankasa.
Focusing on what is important.	Nea ɛho hia a wɔde wɔn adwene besi so.
At least not at the time.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ saa bere no.
His father still lives there.	Ne papa da so ara te hɔ.
It seems to be the same this year.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa ara afe yi.
But that’s how he is.	Nanso saa na ɔte.
I'm doing this.	Meyɛ eyi.
The dog latched onto my leg.	Ɔkraman no de ne nsa bɔɔ me nan so.
We can do it, and we will.	Yebetumi ayɛ, na yɛbɛyɛ.
That was a big part of it.	Ná ɛno yɛ ne fã kɛse.
No one knew anything.	Ná obiara nnim biribi.
It was a happy day for everyone.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye da ma obiara.
It has been very painful for us.	Ayɛ yaw kɛse ama yɛn.
The landing of the city was fraught with danger.	Ná asiane ahyɛ kurow no mu a wɔde besi fam no ma.
Everything is as it should be.	Biribiara te sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
You have the opportunity to do some good things.	Wowɔ hokwan sɛ wobɛyɛ nneɛma pa bi.
The city was already overcrowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ kurow no mu ma dodo dedaw.
The best of the best.	Nea eye sen biara.
But he wasn’t.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ saa.
Come out and come out.	Bɔ na bɔ.
I'll go ahead tomorrow.	Mekɔ anim ɔkyena.
Someone had to say.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ obi ka.
Someone was calling my name.	Ná obi rebɔ me din.
He and the other man also headed out.	Ɔne ɔbarima a aka no nso de wɔn ani kyerɛɛ abɔnten.
I thought about it for a long time.	Misusuw ho bere tenten.
This project was the first of its kind in the current system.	Ná saa adwuma yi yɛ nea edi kan wɔ mprempren nhyehyɛe no mu.
Beautiful and excellent photos.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ na eye sen biara.
All in a short amount of time, too.	Ne nyinaa wɔ bere tiaa bi mu, nso.
What is it that is.	Dɛn ne no.
What does ''they'' mean?	Dɛn na ''wɔ'' kyerɛ?
Maybe he was a little young.	Ebia na ɔyɛ abofra kakra.
And like that and all that.	Na te sɛ ɛno ne ne nyinaa.
But he didn’t know that.	Nanso na onnim saa.
Please move somewhere else.	Mesrɛ wo, tu kɔ baabi foforo.
One should always tell the truth.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi ka nokware bere nyinaa.
This is no longer true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware bio.
I get along with people.	Me ne nkurɔfo di no yiye.
We all love stories.	Yɛn nyinaa ani gye nsɛm ho.
That doesn’t mean these people are wrong.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ saa nkurɔfo yi di mfomso.
Except today.	Gye sɛ nnɛ.
No one can help you.	Obiara ntumi mmoa wo.
He was in no condition to drive.	Ná onni tebea biara mu sɛ ɔbɛka kar.
Maybe it still is.	Ebia ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
I'm like everyone else.	Me te sɛ obiara.
We were set up.	Wɔde yɛn sii hɔ.
The first is pictures.	Nea edi kan ne mfonini ahorow.
He had to come up with something better.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde biribi a eye sen saa ba.
I'm telling it.	Meka no hwɛ.
That’s what the boy is doing here.	Saa na abarimaa no reyɛ wɔ ha.
That could be a big deal.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ asɛm kɛse.
That day has come.	Saa da no adu.
Those you may know.	Wɔn a ebia wunim wɔn.
It’s true, you know.	Ɛyɛ nokware, wunim.
And it doesn’t matter in this case.	Na ɛnyɛ hwee wɔ saa asɛm yi mu.
I just know he doesn’t.	Minim ara ne sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
I was full and satisfied.	Ná meyɛ ma na na m’ani agye.
The strangest thing comes next.	Ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen biara no na edi hɔ.
You might do that.	Ebia wobɛyɛ saa.
Decide what you want to do and do it.	Nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ ho gyinae na woyɛ.
Why would you?.	Dɛn nti na wobɛyɛ?.
I can promise you that.	Metumi ahyɛ wo bɔ saa.
I just can’t understand it.	Mintumi nte ase kɛkɛ.
How to become you.	Sɛnea wobɛyɛ wo.
Neither of them said a word.	Wɔn mu biara anka asɛm biako mpo.
Maybe something else will happen.	Ebia biribi foforo bɛba.
There is no more day.	Da biara nni hɔ bio.
But it does.	Nanso ɛyɛ saa.
He has you to think about.	Ɔwɔ wo a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
A very, very long time.	Bere tenten paa, paa.
Now he doesn't want to.	Mprempren ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔmpɛ.
The moon had passed full.	Ná ɔsram no atwam sɛ ayɛ ma.
Fortunately, they are rare.	Nea eye ne sɛ, wɔn ho yɛ na.
It’s a cold night.	Ɛyɛ awɔw anadwo.
It may be surprising.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nwonwa.
If it works, good.	Sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a, eye.
Scary.	Ɛyɛ hu.
But that would also likely be a lie.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ ɛno nso bɛyɛ atoro.
If only he knew.	Sɛ na onim nkutoo a.
Only believe half of what he tells you.	Gye nea ɔka kyerɛ wo no fã nkutoo di.
I thought it was really good.	Misusuwii sɛ eye ankasa.
This may be true.	Ebia eyi yɛ nokware.
I get it, trust me, but it was so hard.	Me nsa ka, gye me di, nanso na ɛyɛ den yiye.
It doesn’t seem to be the case anymore.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ saa bio.
Just put your shoes on.	Fa wo mpaboa hyɛ kɛkɛ.
He often goes for walks alone.	Ɔno nkutoo taa kɔ nantew.
But there is no one else.	Nanso obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
Your chance will come.	Wo hokwan no bɛba.
Unless someone comes later.	Gye sɛ obi bɛba akyiri yi.
This is happening today.	Eyi rekɔ so nnɛ.
He thinks this was a big mistake.	Osusuw sɛ na eyi yɛ mfomso kɛse.
You are the only one there.	Wo nkutoo na wowɔ hɔ.
I didn’t have enough time.	Ná minni bere a ɛdɔɔso.
She was completely dependent on him for support.	Ná ɔde ne ho to no so koraa sɛ ɔbɛboa no.
The books were interesting.	Ná nhoma ahorow no yɛ anigye.
Look at this picture.	Hwɛ mfonini yi.
I'm getting bigger.	Mereyɛ kɛse.
No one was supposed to say it.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara ka.
This is necessary to maximize input.	Eyi ho hia na ama nsɛm a wɔde hyɛ mu no ayɛ kɛse.
Everything has an end.	Biribiara wɔ awiei.
This work will address these important issues.	Saa adwuma yi bedi nsɛm a ɛho hia yi ho dwuma.
I want them.	Mepɛ wɔn.
It’s a very sensitive thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛte nka kɛse.
The school curriculum is very simple.	Sukuu adesua nhyehyɛe no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
He was so great to work with.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse paa sɛ wo ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
The view of the city is beautiful.	Kurow no hwɛ yɛ fɛ yiye.
There was more now.	Ná pii wɔ hɔ mprempren.
We do that here.	Yɛyɛ saa wɔ ha.
I will end with this one last point.	Mede saa asɛm biako a etwa to yi bɛba awiei.
His strong hands.	Ne nsa a ɛyɛ den no.
That was the last of them.	Ɛno ne wɔn mu nea etwa to.
I thought it was fantastic!.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa!.
But, but, but.	Nanso, nanso, nanso.
Investors were reluctant to offer capital.	Ná wɔn a wɔde wɔn sika hyɛ mu no mpɛ sɛ wɔde sika kɛse bɛma.
You use it well.	Wode di dwuma yiye.
I didn’t have one.	Ná minni bi.
But this would take some time.	Nanso na eyi begye bere kakra.
What an amazing first year.	Afe a edi kan a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni.
I'll take her home now.	Mede no bɛkɔ fie mprempren.
The decision was made unanimously.	Wɔde adwene koro sii gyinae no.
I never thought about that.	Minsusuw saa asɛm no ho da.
Many factors can contribute to this.	Nneɛma pii betumi ama eyi aba.
As it turns out, it wasn’t.	Sɛnea ɛte no, na ɛnte saa.
No one else knows it exists.	Obi foforo biara nnim sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
No one was home.	Ná obiara nni fie.
I don’t have any water with me.	Minni nsu biara ka me ho.
But they don’t make up the whole picture.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wɔn na wɔyɛ mfonini no nyinaa.
The man glanced at the picture on the table.	Ɔbarima no de n’ani kyerɛɛ mfonini a ɛwɔ pon no so no.
Or the boy.	Anaasɛ abarimaa no.
It’s a good idea to do that.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
That is the case in many cases.	Saa na ɛte wɔ nsɛm pii mu.
Not in a bad way.	Ɛnyɛ saa wɔ ɔkwan bɔne so.
The hours on his feet had taken their toll.	Ná nnɔnhwerew pii a ɔde traa ne nan so no agye wɔn ka.
When one is in danger.	Bere a obi wɔ asiane mu.
It will be much, much better.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa kɛse, kɛse.
I love going outside.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛkɔ abɔnten.
I better keep watching.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ mɛkɔ so ahwɛ.
Therefore, there is no control group.	Enti, kuw biara nni hɔ a wɔde di dwuma.
Maybe it really is.	Ebia ɛte saa ankasa.
He’s stuck in his mind.	Ɔde ne ho ahyɛ n’adwene mu.
It’s very very difficult.	Ɛyɛ den yiye paa.
If you're not happy, we're not happy.	Sɛ w'ani nnye a, yɛn ani nnye.
All did not go well in this project.	Ne nyinaa ankɔ yiye wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
I don’t think any of you got that idea.	Minsusuw sɛ mo mu biara nyaa saa adwene no.
There is quite a lot of it.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛdɔɔso yiye.
The group already has a plan.	Kuw no wɔ nhyehyɛe bi dedaw.
This was no longer my home.	Ná eyi nyɛ me fie bio.
Part of that comes from the infrastructure.	Ɛno fã bi fi nneɛma a wɔde reyɛ adwuma no mu.
Therefore, this number was used in subsequent experiments.	Enti, wɔde saa dodow yi dii dwuma wɔ sɔhwɛ ahorow a edi hɔ no mu.
This time around.	Saa bere yi.
That’s why it’s so good.	Ɛno nti na eye saa no.
As a kid, he was always drawing and making things.	Bere a na ɔyɛ abofra no, na ɔyɛ mfonini na ɔyɛ nneɛma bere nyinaa.
However, this arrangement was not very good.	Nanso, na nhyehyɛe yi nyɛ papa kɛse.
You just walk away.	Wo nantew kɔ kɛkɛ.
Just this one thing.	Ade biako yi ara.
They actually do it.	Wɔyɛ no ankasa.
I have no control over it.	Minni so tumi biara.
So, the time had come.	Enti, na bere no adu.
I am very late for work.	Meka akyi paa wɔ adwuma mu.
It wasn’t even new to me.	Ná ɛnyɛ ade foforo mpo mma me.
Maybe it was just a long time ago.	Ebia na ɛyɛ bere tenten a atwam ni ara kwa.
Work, school days.	Adwuma, sukuu nna.
The events that happened.	Nneɛma a esii.
As you say, money and power.	Sɛnea woka no, sika ne tumi.
He always did that.	Ná ɔyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
And you can’t do that either.	Na wo nso worentumi nyɛ saa.
He wanted to do something else.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi foforo.
You can easily access the famous city.	Wubetumi akɔ kurow a agye din no mu a ɛnyɛ den.
He is definitely a dog.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔyɛ ɔkraman.
The two had seen each other.	Na wɔn baanu no ahu wɔn ho wɔn ho.
And yet, to me, he was always a favorite.	Na nanso, wɔ me fam no, na ɔyɛ obi a m’ani gye ne ho bere nyinaa.
They were so beautiful.	Ná wɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
This is also not true.	Eyi nso nyɛ nokware.
Someone you would give everything to.	Obi a wode biribiara bɛma no.
That’s a fact.	Ɛno yɛ nokware.
This is beautiful.	Eyi yɛ fɛ.
It was the best of the best.	Ná ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
We have to do it ourselves.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn ankasa yɛ.
Verify each claim.	Hwɛ sɛ asɛm biara a wɔka no yɛ nokware anaa.
However, there are some issues.	Nanso, nsɛm bi wɔ hɔ.
Your homework is late.	Wo fie nnwuma no aka akyi.
The atmosphere in that room was tense.	Ná tebea a ɛwɔ saa dan no mu no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
Just add a little fun.	Fa anigye kakra ka ho kɛkɛ.
I wonder how that makes her feel.	Misusuw sɛnea ɛno ma ɔte nka no ho.
That is the only reason.	Ɛno nkutoo ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
You’ll be interested in that too.	Wo nso w’ani begye saa asɛm no ho.
It was a thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade.
I love this moment.	M’ani gye saa bere yi ho.
I loved clothes from a bygone era.	Ná m’ani gye ntade a ɛwɔ bere bi a atwam ho.
It may be painful.	Ebia ɛyɛ yaw.
And everything goes to the way it should.	Na biribiara kɔ so kosi sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
And he was with them.	Na ɔka wɔn ho.
Not bad and not great.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne na ɛnyɛ kɛse.
Hope you like it!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani gye ho!.
I want to know everything.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu biribiara.
But it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛnyɛ hwee.
This system was implemented.	Wɔde saa nhyehyɛe yi dii dwuma.
My mother is right.	Me maame asɛm no yɛ nokware.
I hear about them every day.	Mete wɔn asɛm da biara da.
I have a hard time driving.	Ɛyɛ den ma me sɛ mɛka kar.
This thing is for you.	Saa ade yi yɛ ma wo.
So much for the characters.	Enti pii ma nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no.
I do this for several reasons.	Nneɛma pii nti na meyɛ eyi.
I'm sorry, boy.	Mepa wo kyɛw, abarimaa.
He knows where my head is.	Onim baabi a me ti wɔ.
If it is for a short time.	Sɛ ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi a.
A really great guy.	Ɔbarima kɛse bi ankasa.
I hear it every few days.	Mete no nna kakraa biara.
Appearance is nothing.	Sɛnea ɛte no nyɛ biribiara.
Check out the music.	Hwɛ nnwom.
He did so.	Ɔyɛɛ saa.
And another, it’s over.	Na foforo nso, aba awiei.
Some of these cases are extremely rare.	Saa nsɛm yi bi ho yɛ na koraa.
It looks beautiful.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
It’s free and instant.	Ɛho nnye hwee na ɛyɛ ntɛm ara.
That alone is no easy task.	Ɛno nkutoo nyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Trust that everything will be fine.	Fa wo ho to so sɛ biribiara bɛyɛ yiye.
Legs are in right now.	Nan wɔ mu mprempren ara.
These clothes come out.	Ntade yi fi mu ba.
But he also never knew why.	Nanso na onnim nea enti a ɛte saa nso da.
Enough has already happened.	Nea ɛdɔɔso aba dedaw.
However, the problem remains.	Nanso, ɔhaw no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
There is something he does not want you to know.	Biribi wɔ hɔ a ɔmpɛ sɛ wuhu.
I will do the same.	Me nso mɛyɛ saa.
It was gorgeous, but expensive.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ yiye, nanso na ne bo yɛ den.
He doesn’t have our help.	Onni yɛn mmoa.
Only what is true.	Nea ɛyɛ nokware nkutoo.
With everyone, really.	Ne obiara, ampa.
If not, they should be.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
So no problem there.	Enti ɔhaw biara nni hɔ wɔ hɔ.
I believe we are better than evil.	Migye di sɛ yɛyɛ papa sen bɔne.
No money comes from the plan.	Sika biara mfi nhyehyɛe no mu mma.
It has to be you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo.
I actually have one.	Mewɔ bi ankasa.
And there was nothing.	Na biribiara nni hɔ.
We actually have better things than him.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma a eye sen ɔno ankasa.
This new support has a lot of potential to talk about.	Saa mmoa foforo yi wɔ tumi kɛse a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka ho asɛm.
He nodded his head.	Ɔde ne ti too fam.
Most people can’t do that.	Nnipa dodow no ara ntumi nyɛ saa.
This statement takes things further.	Saa asɛm yi ma nneɛma kɔ akyiri.
He built a new bicycle.	Ɔyɛɛ sakre foforo bi.
However, he wanted more.	Nanso, na ɔpɛ pii.
Hope this information has been helpful.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ saa nsɛm yi aboa.
I hope he feels that way about what this looks like.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔte nka saa wɔ sɛnea eyi te ho.
I love the water.	M’ani gye nsu no ho.
That was a good thing.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade pa.
With the hope in her eyes.	Wɔ anidaso a ɛwɔ n’ani so no.

The road was gone.	Ná ɔkwan no nni hɔ bio.
He used it in the right way.	Ɔde dii dwuma ɔkwan pa so.
It was his home.	Ná ɛyɛ ne fie.
At least he was alive and looked somewhat alive.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɔte ase na na ɔte sɛ nea ɔte ase kakra.
The rear end is on display.	Akyi awiei no yɛ nea wɔde kyerɛ.
He was such a test for her.	Ná ɔyɛ sɔhwɛ a ɛte saa ma no.
It wasn’t scary.	Ná ɛnyɛ hu.
You had to be strong.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ den.
Legs cannot move backwards.	Nan ntumi nkɔ akyi.
In my hands.	Wɔ me nsa so.
I think we need to do something about it.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi.
It wasn’t a problem.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɔhaw biara.
It had cost money to build.	Ná agye sika de asi.
No one should be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara yɛ saa.
I've done it, and it wasn't pretty.	Mayɛ, na ɛnyɛ fɛ.
Anyway, that was years ago.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na ɛno yɛ mfe bi a atwam ni.
You don’t like these things.	W’ani nnye saa nneɛma yi ho.
And it was very good.	Na ɛyɛ papa yiye.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
No one can imagine him doing that.	Obiara ntumi nsusuw sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
Take him to your room.	Fa no kɔ wo dan mu.
This city has many jobs.	Saa kurow yi wɔ nnwuma pii.
Many are the same.	Pii nso te saa ara.
It’s hard to take with me now.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ mede bɛka me ho mprempren.
I have a good sense of people.	Mewɔ nnipa ho adwene pa.
This is still true.	Eyi da so ara yɛ nokware.
Kids love to play with their food.	Mmofra ani gye ho sɛ wɔde wɔn aduan bedi agoru.
I’m glad, for you, that he has.	M’ani agye, ma wo, sɛ ɔwɔ bi.
You’ll be relieved.	Wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
Two children.	Mmofra baanu.
However, the present data include two additional points.	Nanso, mprempren nsɛm a wɔde ama no ka nsɛm abien foforo ka ho.
It’s good to be among his things.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛka ne nneɛma ho.
That wasn't so easy these days.	Ná ɛno nyɛ mmerɛw saa nnansa yi.
He is doing it himself.	Ɔno ankasa na ɔreyɛ.
He didn't know why.	Ná onnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
I love you so much.	Mepɛ wo paa.
Not that he would ever tell her that.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔbɛka saa akyerɛ no da.
In my system.	Wɔ me nhyehyɛe mu.
Do you see what you are doing?	So wuhu nea woreyɛ no?
The more you think about it, the weirder it gets.	Dodow a wususuw ho no, dodow no ara na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
How does this affect you?	Eyi ka wo dɛn?
I feel so lucky.	Mete nka sɛ mewɔ anigye kɛse.
I live here now.	Mete ha mprempren.
He looked like a different person.	Ná ɔte sɛ onipa foforo.
You need me and me alone.	Wo hia me ne me nkutoo.
You can literally do anything.	Wubetumi ayɛ biribiara ankasa.
Really, it was a mistake.	Ankasa, na ɛyɛ mfomso.
I can and will do that.	Metumi na mɛyɛ saa.
No sane person likes it.	Onipa biara nni hɔ a n’adwene mu da hɔ a n’ani gye ho.
He wanted nothing more than sex now.	Ná ɔmpɛ hwee sɛ nna mprempren.
Just happy, happy, happy.	Anigye, anigye, anigye ara kwa.
He’s a big boy now.	Ɔyɛ abarimaa kɛse mprempren.
You have to give me that too.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode saa nso ma me.
I can’t say much about it here yet.	Mintumi nka ho asɛm pii wɔ ha de besi nnɛ.
This is your greatest opportunity.	Eyi ne wo hokwan kɛse.
This is not how it works.	Eyi nyɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma.
Maybe that’s important.	Ebia ɛno ho hia.
She wants to feel his touch.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte nka sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka no.
You go, you.	Wo kɔ, wo.
What a story this is.	Asɛm bɛn ara ni.
A loaded gun lies on the table.	Tuo bi a wɔde nneɛma ahyɛ mu ma da pon no so.
And and yours.	Ne ne wo de.
Look deeper, though, and you see the truth.	Nanso, hwɛ mu kɔ akyiri, na wuhu nokware no.
But there was a bigger issue.	Nanso na asɛm kɛse bi wɔ hɔ.
No one mentioned it.	Obiara anka ho asɛm.
That’s an idea.	Ɛno yɛ adwene bi.
Finally he nodded.	Awiei koraa no ɔde ne ti too fam.
I don’t know how that’s going to work out.	Minnim sɛnea ɛno bɛyɛ yiye.
The dress was too tight for me.	Ná atade no mu yɛ den dodo ma me.
This increases the drawing time.	Eyi ma bere a wɔde yɛ mfonini no yɛ kɛse.
But that certainly also meant that he did not know the truth.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛno nso kyerɛ sɛ na onnim nokware no.
One last thing.	Ade biako a etwa to.
Which seems to be.	Nea ɛte sɛ nea.
Just give him some space.	Ma no baabi kakra kɛkɛ.
This feature is available now.	Saa ade yi wɔ hɔ mprempren.
However, he wasn’t saying anything either.	Nanso, na ɔno nso nka hwee.
They were doing well then too.	Na wɔn nso reyɛ yiye saa bere no.
There was nothing else here, anymore.	Na biribi foforo biara nni ha, bio.
He is a very vulnerable person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Get out of there.	Fi hɔ kɔ.
I have to look into it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu.
He doesn’t like parties or anything.	Ɔmpɛ apontow anaa biribiara.
Here is how they work in very simple terms.	Sɛnea wɔyɛ adwuma wɔ nsɛm a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye mu ni.
But it just doesn’t exist anymore.	Nanso ɛnyɛ hɔ bio kɛkɛ.
Everything just comes from trial and error.	Biribiara fi sɔhwɛ ne mfomso mu ara kwa.
It’s the first thing you do.	Ɛyɛ ade a edi kan a woyɛ.
But we can’t let that happen.	Nanso yɛrentumi mma ɛnyɛ saa.
This was another trend.	Ná eyi nso yɛ ade foforo a ɛrekɔ so.
Tomorrow is a new one.	Ɔkyena yɛ foforo.
I couldn’t believe how close this really was.	Na mintumi nnye nni sɛnea eyi bɛn no ankasa.
It’s not that much.	Ɛnyɛ pii saa.
As recently as last week as well.	Nnansa yi ara te sɛ dapɛn a etwaam no sɛnea ɛte no.
I'll give that a shot.	Mede saa no bɛma no tuo.
You don’t like it, wear something else.	W’ani nnye ho, hyɛ biribi foforo.
I couldn’t take it anymore.	Ná mintumi nnye bio.
Or the last one.	Anaasɛ nea etwa to no.
But there is a reason for that.	Nanso biribi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
But they warm up to each other later.	Nanso wɔyɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho hyew akyiri yi.
None of that really matters.	Ɛno mu biara ho nhia ankasa.
It doesn’t seem to work.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ adwuma.
It’s fun, it has a story, and the sex is fantastic.	Ɛyɛ anigye, ɛwɔ asɛm bi, na nna no nso yɛ nwonwa.
She was no longer beautiful.	Ná ne ho nyɛ fɛ bio.
Good for him, man.	Eye ma no, onipa.
I heard, everyone heard.	Metee, obiara tee.
The increased use of cars has many negative consequences.	Kar a wɔde di dwuma kɛse no de nneɛma bɔne pii aba.
But the work continues to get harder.	Nanso adwuma no kɔ so yɛ den kɛse.
It was the weekend.	Ná ɛyɛ dapɛn awiei.
Perhaps he did.	Ebia ɔyɛɛ saa.
The water was alive.	Ná nsu no te ase.
Signed in the picture section.	Wɔde wɔn nsa ahyɛ ase wɔ mfonini no fã hɔ.
He enjoyed the party very much.	N’ani gyee apontow no ho yiye.
I don’t like the man.	M’ani nnye ɔbarima no ho.
He soaked in the cold.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ awɔw no mu.
There is no such thing, nor is it for you.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa, na saa ara nso na ɛnyɛ saa mma wo.
In the end, the truth will prevail.	Awiei koraa no, nokware no bedi nkonim.
But if	Nanso sɛ .
Another is jobs.	Foforo nso ne nnwuma.
The use of books.	Nhoma a wɔde di dwuma.
Even if the people are happy, there is still much to do.	Sɛ nkurɔfo no ani gye mpo a, nneɛma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I'm with you on that.	Me ne wo wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
He had one too many.	Ná ɔwɔ biako a ɛdɔɔso dodo.
Only a matter of time.	Bere ho asɛm nkutoo.
Let him check it out!.	Ma no hwɛ!.
We are all	Yɛn nyinaa .
Wonderful stuff !!.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa !!.
And they are certainly rare.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔn ho yɛ na.
But that would be too easy.	Nanso ɛno bɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
And my mother, too.	Na me maame nso.
But this also means, that you shouldn’t.	Nanso eyi kyerɛ nso, sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
All in all, it’s only a couple of hours’ work.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abien pɛ adwuma.
We cannot cooperate with them.	Yɛrentumi ne wɔn nyɛ biako.
Tell your friends.	Ka kyerɛ wo nnamfo.
That sounds pretty simple, but it wasn’t.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ mmerɛw yiye, nanso na ɛnte saa.
But you are very good.	Nanso wo ho yɛ papa paa.
They have to behave properly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔn ade yiye.
People understand this very well.	Nkurɔfo te eyi ase yiye.
It has definitely made me a new person.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ama mayɛ onipa foforo.
If it’s possible, you know, people will.	Sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye a, wunim, nkurɔfo bɛyɛ.
I think you must have known.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na wunim.
There is a shortage of power.	Tumi a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho ayɛ na.
Be careful what you wish for!	Hwɛ yiye wɔ nea wopɛ ho!
He looks like everyone else.	Ɔte sɛ obiara.
Get out! 	Fi adi!
It was his time.	Ná ɛyɛ ne bere.
That money was nothing.	Ná saa sika no nyɛ hwee.
There were several factors behind this idea.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ saa adwene yi akyi.
This time, he had something better.	Saa bere yi de, na ɔwɔ biribi a eye sen saa.
Put it on.	Fa no hyɛ.
Everyone was still at home.	Ná obiara da so ara wɔ fie.
I don’t need that right now.	Me nhia saa mprempren.
While supplies last!.	Bere a nneɛma a wɔde ma no kɔ so tra hɔ no!.
But this is just my opinion.	Nanso eyi yɛ m’adwene ara kwa.
The music came to an end.	Nnwom no baa awiei.
Every one of you is amazing.	Mo mu biara yɛ nwonwa.
Everyone raised their hands.	Obiara maa ne nsa so.
Don’t tell the police.	Nka nkyerɛ polisifo.
I can get some of it.	Metumi anya bi.
There must be danger.	Ɛsɛ sɛ asiane wɔ hɔ.
Take that as a given.	Fa saa asɛm no sɛ ade a wɔde ama.
I just wondered how everyone would do.	Na misusuw sɛnea obiara bɛyɛ ho ara kwa.
That makes you think.	Ɛno ma wususuw nneɛma ho.
Just not the same idea you have, maybe.	Kɛkɛ a ɛnyɛ adwene koro no ara a wowɔ no, ebia.
People don’t understand pictures.	Nkurɔfo nte mfonini ahorow ase.
This may sound like a strange story, but it is.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ te sɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa, nanso saa na ɛte.
Anything could happen.	Ná biribiara betumi asi.
A beautiful child.	Abofra a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It’s the mindset of the mind.	Ɛyɛ adwene a ɛwɔ adwene no mu.
Your appearance is your habit.	Wo ho yɛ wo su.
It was a lie.	Ná ɛyɛ atoro.
I didn’t really want anything.	Ná mempɛ biribiara ankasa.
He just loved their quality.	Ná n’ani gye ho ara ne wɔn su no.
As long as we have to.	Bere tenten a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa no.
I want to drive my car.	Mepɛ sɛ meka me kar no.
You are too young.	Woyɛ abofra dodo.
I hardly even know him.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ minnim no mpo.
She did everything for him.	Ná ɔyɛ biribiara ma no.
We got it right.	Yɛn nsa kaa no.
Maybe that’s the last time.	Ebia ɛno ne bere a etwa to.
It was amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Maybe for money.	Ebia sika nti.
Many vehicles disturb this road.	Kar pii haw ɔkwan yi so.
If he wants to.	Sɛ ɔpɛ a.
This is not just for show.	Eyi nyɛ nea wɔde kyerɛ nkutoo.
Not true in this industry.	Ɛnyɛ nokware wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
It all takes time.	Ne nyinaa gye bere.
I want him to be happy.	Mepɛ sɛ n’ani gye.
This is something we have to do.	Eyi yɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
He could touch her if he wanted to.	Ná obetumi de ne nsa aka no sɛ ɔpɛ a.
It’s too easy.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
That’s another story.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo.
But this situation is what it is.	Nanso tebea yi ne nea ɛte.
However, this is completely false.	Nanso, eyi yɛ atoro koraa.
I just had to believe it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ migye di ara kwa.
I still do that.	Meda so ara yɛ saa.
He must have made them.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔno na ɔyɛɛ wɔn.
I’m absolutely thrilled.	M’ani gye ho koraa.
Enough about me.	Ɛdɔɔso fa me ho.
I liked it a lot at the time.	M’ani gyee ho kɛse saa bere no.
I’m happy for him, really.	M’ani agye ma no, ampa.
I see why it’s important.	Mihu nea enti a ɛho hia no.
The price is definitely good.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ne bo yɛ papa.
No method is perfect.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ pɛ.
That’s what this article is about.	Ɛno ne nea asɛm yi fa ho.
Almost everything is controlled by work.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔde adwuma di biribiara so.
I know they will love this.	Minim sɛ wɔn ani begye eyi ho.
He was very excited.	Ná n’ani agye yiye.
Nor does it have to be perfect.	Saa ara nso na ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ pɛ.
He leaned out the window.	Ɔde ne ho too mfɛnsere no mu.
It was a long night.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo tenten bi.
He had a name.	Na ɔwɔ din.
If you close one eye, it might be hard to do.	Sɛ wode w’ani biako to mu a, ebia ɛbɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ.
And also that	Na nso sɛ .
The mind doesn’t exist.	Adwene no nni hɔ.
It was worse than ever.	Na ɛyɛ bɔne sen bere biara.
I discussed things with him many times.	Me ne no susuw nneɛma ho mpɛn pii.
And yet people still go there.	Na nanso nkurɔfo da so ara kɔ hɔ.
There was something odd about it.	Ná biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ho.
So the man had told the truth after all.	Enti na ɔbarima no aka nokware wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
I can still leave without being noticed.	Meda so ara tumi fi hɔ a obiara nhu.
For me, this is the moment.	Wɔ me fam no, eyi ne bere no.
She was not having sex with this boy.	Ná ɔne abarimaa yi nna.
What do we do with it.	Dɛn na yɛyɛ.
Stay up late, stay up late.	Tra ase anadwo, da akyiri.
It’s as simple as it gets.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛte no.
It’s another reason why.	Ɛyɛ ade foforo nti a ɛte saa.
Or maybe you would have.	Anaasɛ ebia anka wobɛyɛ saa.
I believe he has done so.	Migye di sɛ wayɛ saa.
All by the same user.	Ne nyinaa yɛ nea ɔde di dwuma koro no ara.
There is enough food on everyone’s table.	Aduan a ɛdɔɔso wɔ obiara pon so.
That’s the first time he’s done that.	Ɛno ne bere a edi kan a wayɛ saa.
That makes it mine.	Ɛno ma ɛyɛ me de.
None of us are there.	Yɛn mu biara nni hɔ.
So there are things that .	Enti nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a .
But it’s something so simple.	Nanso ɛyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
City planning was a thing of the past.	Ná kurow no mu nhyehyɛe yɛ ade a atwam.
That’s a big deal.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse.
There was so much to do,	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ, .
We have probably all driven past it many times.	Ebia yɛn nyinaa aka kar atwam mpɛn pii.
Even that would be really hard.	Ná ɛno mpo bɛyɛ den ankasa.
I'll tell you the truth.	Me deɛ, mɛka nokware.
He knew time was running out.	Ná onim sɛ bere reyɛ tiaa.
This seems to be the current situation.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi bɛyɛ mprempren tebea no.
No one seems to be able to help him.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara ntumi mmoa no.
And that bothered them.	Na ɛno haw wɔn.
Keep up the good work.	Kɔ so yɛ adwuma pa no.
As if he had some power.	Te sɛ nea na ɔwɔ tumi bi.
But he did it.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ saa.
Believe me it’s great.	Gye me di sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse.
He's on the street outside.	Ɔwɔ abɔnten so wɔ abɔnten.
Is there any help? 	Mmoa bi wɔ hɔ?
This can’t be that big of a deal.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ asɛm kɛse saa.
The same was true of us.	Saa ara na na ɛte wɔ yɛn fam.
Or so it was.	Anaasɛ saa na na ɛte.
That didn’t work out for me either.	Ɛno nso anyɛ yiye amma me.
He seemed weak now.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wayɛ mmerɛw mprempren.
And it’s important.	Na ɛho hia.
That’s part of what our work here is about, you know.	Ɛno yɛ nea yɛn adwuma a yɛyɛ wɔ ha no fa ho no fã, wunim.
He has no job.	Onni adwuma biara.
Right now in this moment.	Mprempren yi ara wɔ saa bere yi mu.
He did the same thing, too.	Ɔno nso yɛɛ saa ara.
Predicting how people will react is difficult.	Sɛnea nnipa bɛyɛ wɔn ade no a wobɛka ho asɛm akyerɛ no yɛ den.
It looked pretty cool.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
It’s that simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
It was all very good stuff.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ nneɛma a eye yiye.
If you want to say something, say it.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ woka biribi a, ka.
But the time may be short.	Nanso ebia bere no bɛyɛ tiaa.
I highly doubt that.	Migye saa asɛm no ho kyim kɛse.
There were many dangers involved.	Ná asiane pii ka ho.
He felt much better.	Ne ho tɔɔ no kɛse.
The bottom line is.	Nea ɛwɔ ase hɔ no.
However, it failed to do so.	Nanso, antumi anyɛ saa.
That’s really what this is all about.	Ɛno ne nea eyi nyinaa te ankasa.
Everything was perfect.	Ná biribiara yɛ pɛ.
But you don’t have to work at it.	Nanso ɛho nhia sɛ woyɛ adwuma wɔ ho.
It’s not time.	Ɛnyɛ bere.
Many just want it.	Pii pɛ no ara kwa.
He was here a while ago.	Ná ɔwɔ ha bere tiaa bi a atwam ni.
Everything is happening too fast.	Biribiara rekɔ so ntɛmntɛm dodo.
There was something about him.	Ná biribi wɔ ne ho.
Last time for you.	Bere a etwa to ma wo.
It was too late now.	Ná aka akyi dodo mprempren.
I think you can keep at it.	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi akɔ so ayɛ saa.
He knew he had to worry about it.	Ná onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔhaw ne ho wɔ ho.
The same people.	Nnipa koro no ara.
I did those things against your will.	Meyɛɛ saa nneɛma no tiaa wo pɛ.
The same is true in this case.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ asɛm yi mu.
He must have been the only one alive.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɔno nkutoo na ɔte ase.
It seemed like a long time.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ bere tenten.
His claim won the case.	Nea ɔde kaa no no dii nkonim wɔ asɛm no mu.
A trial was held for three days.	Wɔde nnansa dii asɛm bi.
This was really good.	Ná eyi yɛ papa ankasa.
You just have enough time.	Wowɔ bere a ɛdɔɔso ara kwa.
Much longer than that.	Pii tenten sen saa.
People do this.	Nkurɔfo yɛ eyi.
A child would be perfect.	Anka abofra bɛyɛ pɛ.
It wasn’t any animal.	Ná ɛnyɛ aboa biara.
The two of them.	Wɔn baanu no.
That was just me.	Ná ɛno nkutoo ne me.
The task is not as easy as it sounds.	Adwuma no nyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛte no.
I love the stuff.	M’ani gye nneɛma no ho.
Maybe years ago.	Ebia mfe bi a atwam ni.
The walk was interesting.	Ná nantew no yɛ anigye.
They were difficult days.	Ná ɛyɛ nna a ɛyɛ den.
It was the best moment of any day.	Ná ɛno ne bere a eye sen biara wɔ da biara da mu.
I couldn’t think of a single thing to say.	Ná mintumi nsusuw asɛm biako mpo ho sɛ mɛka.
It was a pleasure.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye.
Something else, too.	Biribi foforo nso.
That doesn’t matter to you.	Ɛno nyɛ asɛm mma wo.
They put everything in the house on their backs.	Wɔde biribiara a ɛwɔ fie hɔ no to wɔn akyi.
It was better than that.	Ná eye sen saa.
He shouldn’t even think about it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ osusuw ho mpo.
But he’s not one of those types, he’s not.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa su no mu biako, ɔnyɛ saa.
It was hard, hard, hard.	Ná ɛyɛ den, ɛyɛ den, ɛyɛ den.
Who knew what my mother looked like.	Hena na na onim sɛnea me maame te.
The most important thing to him was the next issue.	Ade a na ɛho hia no paa ne asɛm a edi hɔ no.
His eyes are still on the picture.	N’ani da so ara wɔ mfonini no so.
But this was much bigger.	Nanso na eyi yɛ kɛse kɛse.
The dog’s fur is so soft!	Ɔkraman no ho nhwi yɛ mmerɛw yiye!
He doesn’t seem to be.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔnyɛ saa.
So the products are the same old products, nothing new.	Enti nneɛma a wɔyɛ no yɛ nneɛma dedaw koro no ara, biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
Our work shows that it almost never is.	Yɛn adwuma no kyerɛ sɛ ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ saa da.
But we did the job with enthusiasm.	Nanso yɛde anigye yɛɛ adwuma no.
I wish you could see the details.	Me yam a anka wubetumi ahu nsɛm no mu nsɛm kɔ akyiri.
I will be more focused.	Mede m’ani besi nneɛma so kɛse.
The only problem is the price.	Ɔhaw a ɛwɔ hɔ ara ne ne bo.
You are not alone.	Ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo na wowɔ hɔ.
Say you want those two things.	Ka sɛ wopɛ saa nneɛma abien no.
It seemed so much easier to go with him.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse sɛ ɔne no rekɔ.
But the team itself still couldn’t seem to figure it out.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea kuw no ankasa da so ara ntumi nhu.
If you do it right.	Sɛ woyɛ no yiye a.
Thank you so much.	Meda wo ase pa ara.
You just have to see it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no ara kwa.
But it didn’t do any good.	Nanso anyɛ papa biara.
But it was still really disturbing.	Nanso na ɛda so ara haw ankasa.
He had no idea what to say.	Ná onni nea ɔbɛka ho adwene biara.
It’s a cold winter, so keep warm.	Ɛyɛ awɔw bere a awɔw wom, enti ma wo ho nyɛ hyew.
He’s a good guy.	Ɔyɛ papa.
There is much work to be done.	Adwuma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
And whatever else they do.	Na nea aka biara a wɔyɛ no.
That’s not the real problem.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne ɔhaw ankasa.
Things could have gone differently.	Anka nneɛma betumi akɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
Both would move on.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa bɛkɔ wɔn anim.
It’s in you.	Ɛwɔ wo.
He lived in one of my houses.	Ná ɔte me fie biako.
You shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
The latter is the most interesting.	Nea etwa to no ne nea ɛyɛ anigye sen biara.
My sin at the time.	Me bɔne saa bere no.
And the child, too.	Na abofra no nso.
So the words themselves are important.	Enti nsɛm no ankasa ho hia.
He didn't want to do it.	Na ɔmpɛ koraa sɛ ɔbɛyɛ no.
Tell him what is there.	Ka nea ɛwɔ hɔ kyerɛ no.
I have a dog, and he is very cute.	Mewɔ ɔkraman, na ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
This all sounds very put-together.	Eyi nyinaa te sɛ nea wɔde ahyɛ mu kɛse.
It’s not always a good thing.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛyɛ ade pa.
You were amazing.	Ná wo ho yɛ nwonwa.
My mind is amazed.	M’adwene yɛ me nwonwa.
That said, this was not my favorite.	Ɛno akyi no, na eyi nyɛ nea m’ani gye ho kɛse.
Don’t think about it, just do it!.	Nsusuw ho, yɛ no ara kwa!.
But everyone's.	Nanso obiara de.
Over and over and over again.	Mpɛn pii mpɛn pii.
He agreed with me on everything.	Ɔne me yɛɛ adwene wɔ biribiara ho.
Check for loading.	Hwɛ sɛ ebia wɔde nneɛma ahyɛ mu anaa.
But he just has to comply.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ odi so ara kwa.
It must be about the same length.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ne tenten.
I can handle old school.	Metumi adi sukuu dedaw ho dwuma.
I should have watched them with you.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo hwɛ wɔn.
He knew he shouldn't.	Ná onim sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Is your hair getting longer?	So wo ti nhwi reyɛ tenten?
Each of them nodded.	Wɔn mu biara de ne ti too fam.
So this is a new thing.	Enti eyi yɛ ade foforo.
I'm surprised he's in such good shape.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa sɛ ɔwɔ tebea pa mu te sɛ eyi.
We both did that.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛɛ saa.
Many people do that.	Nnipa pii yɛ saa.
This information should be constantly updated.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa nsɛm yi foforo bere nyinaa.
He was too strong.	Ná ne ho yɛ den dodo.
There seems to be nothing to do.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
But it will eventually work out.	Nanso awiei koraa no ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
Here is some help with this method if needed.	Mmoa bi ni wɔ saa kwan yi ho sɛ ɛho hia a.
It should work fine now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma yiye mprempren.
Lots of good friends too.	Nnamfo pa pii nso.
And walk around with yourself.	Na fa wo ho nantew.
He is a perfectionist, just like me.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ pɛ, te sɛ me ara.
I believe so.	Migye di saa.
Anyone can do that.	Obiara betumi ayɛ saa.
They all seem to be good plans.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔn nyinaa yɛ nhyehyɛe pa.
It’s dangerous.	Ɛyɛ asiane.
That’s picture enough.	Ɛno ne mfonini a ɛdɔɔso.
It’s just not all the work.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma no nyinaa kɛkɛ.
I can’t see this.	Mintumi nhu eyi.
The most popular stories prove to be true.	Nsɛm a nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse no da adi sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
We used seasonal supplies.	Yɛde nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma wɔ bere bi mu no dii dwuma.
The door closed.	Ɔpon no too mu.
It’s cold, and yet it also feels warm.	Ɛyɛ awɔw, na nanso ɛte nka nso sɛ ɛyɛ hyew.
Be the best at everything.	Yɛ nea eye sen biara wɔ biribiara ho.
They will be very happy after a while.	Wɔn ani begye yiye wɔ kakra akyi.
Getting the job done as quickly as possible is important.	Adwuma no a wobɛyɛ no ntɛm sɛnea wubetumi no ho hia.
That was what everyone would talk about later.	Ɛno ne nea na obiara bɛka ho asɛm akyiri yi.
And life is.	Na nkwa yɛ.
The child continues to cry.	Abofra no kɔ so su.
I love all that stuff, too.	M’ani gye saa nneɛma no nyinaa ho, nso.
Please don’t go, please stay.	Mesrɛ wo, nkɔ, mesrɛ wo tra.
No one wants to make the first move.	Obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ade a edi kan.
But only then.	Nanso saa bere no nkutoo.
You were all the way.	Na wowɔ wo nyinaa kwan no so.
I keep thinking he might have a weak spot.	Mekɔ so susuw sɛ ebia ɔwɔ baabi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw.
But no one could.	Nanso obiara antumi.
It really had it all.	Ná ɛwɔ ne nyinaa ankasa.
I could give you a job.	Ná metumi ama wo adwuma.
I had no idea where we were.	Ná minnim baabi a yɛwɔ.
It’s just one day.	Ɛyɛ da koro pɛ.
But that’s pretty much all.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno nkutoo.
At least he once belonged.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɔyɛ ne de bere bi.
I need to know better.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu yiye.
The problem is.	Ɔhaw no.
Like all of his books, this one is about people.	Te sɛ ne nhoma ahorow nyinaa no, eyi fa nnipa ho.
There is nothing in it.	Biribiara nni mu.
I want to forget.	Mepɛ sɛ me werɛ fi.
But there is still much to be done.	Nanso pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I know he knows.	Minim sɛ onim.
Give them some new clothes.	Ma wɔn ntade foforo bi.
It must have been a mistake.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ mfomso.
Or, at least, one of his eyes turned to us.	Anaasɛ, anyɛ yiye koraa no, n’ani biako dan kɔɔ yɛn so.
You don’t want to be like him.	Wompɛ sɛ wobɛyɛ sɛ ɔno.
Maybe that works for you, and if it does, that’s fantastic.	Ebia ɛno yɛ adwuma ma wo, na sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a, ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Now no one does, and things look good.	Mprempren obiara nyɛ saa, na nneɛma hwɛ yiye.
There is nothing in the car.	Biribiara nni kar no mu.
There is plenty of room for the imagination to run wild.	Baabi pii wɔ hɔ a adwene no betumi atu mmirika akɔ mu.
He does everything on purpose.	Ahyɛ da yɛ biribiara.
But they have to do what they are told.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nea wɔka kyerɛ wɔn no.
So do you want to do that.	Saa ara nso na wopɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
And so the whole thing began.	Na saa na asɛm no nyinaa fii ase.
And that was just last week.	Na ɛno yɛ dapɛn a etwaam no ara pɛ.
He looked so young.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
The bad guys make it so easy.	Nnipa bɔne no ma ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
Things that seemed glamorous now seem glamorous.	Nneɛma a na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ mprempren no te sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
But what you do is very important.	Nanso nea woyɛ no ho hia paa.
There are many of them.	Wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
This method was often used by older people.	Ná nnipa a wɔn mfe akɔ anim taa de saa kwan yi di dwuma.
It’s good for them.	Ɛyɛ papa ma wɔn.
You don’t have to do it manually.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode nsa yɛ.
You are so tall!	Wo tenten paa!
They are better than that.	Wɔyɛ papa sen saa.
They are very strong.	Wɔn a wɔn ho yɛ den yiye.
But something happened.	Nanso biribi sii.
Everyone wants to play every day.	Obiara pɛ sɛ odi agoru da biara da.
The afternoon was enjoyably spent.	Wɔde awia no dii dwuma anigye so.
I hope you enjoy it anyway.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho ɔkwan biara so.
He enjoyed the work.	N’ani gyee adwuma no ho.
I hope you enjoy it tonight.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho anadwo yi.
None of this seems possible.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi mu biara ntumi nyɛ yiye.
And I look forward to working with him again.	Na me nso mehwɛ kwan sɛ me ne no bɛyɛ adwuma bio.
It was a pleasure to know you.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye sɛ minim wo.
He brings them home one after the other.	Ɔde wɔn ba fie biako akyi.
He explains why.	Ɔka nea enti a ɛte saa.
If anyone could offer any help it would be awesome.	Sɛ obi betumi de mmoa biara ama a anka ɛbɛyɛ hu.
You can check if this is available.	Wubetumi ahwɛ sɛ eyi wɔ hɔ anaa.
There is no other true story.	Nokware asɛm foforo biara nni hɔ.
Your best stuff.	Wo nneɛma a eye sen biara.
There was no reason to think anyone would now.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ osusuw sɛ obi bɛyɛ saa mprempren.
In their view, that is wrong.	Wɔ wɔn adwene mu no, ɛno yɛ mfomso.
Thus, quantity is paramount to success.	Enti, dodow ho hia sen biara na ama asi yiye.
The danger is past, the crisis is over.	Asiane no atwam, ɔhaw no aba awiei.
So, keep an eye out.	Enti, hwɛ so.
He may say his name.	Ebia ɔbɛka ne din.
This is what you wanted, right?	Eyi ne nea na wopɛ, ɛnte saa?
It may be dangerous.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nea asiane wom.
I tell them the truth.	Meka nokware kyerɛ wɔn.
People he probably didn’t have.	Nnipa a ebia na onni bi.
He is so amazing.	Ɔyɛ nwonwa paa.
Just one more time.	Bere biako pɛ bio.
It doesn’t really have to be hard.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ den ankasa.
Just shut it down.	To mu kɛkɛ.
And if not .	Na sɛ ɛnte saa a .
However, the situation is a little more complicated.	Nanso, tebea no mu yɛ den kakra.
The drought caused food shortages.	Ɔpɛ no maa aduan ho yɛɛ na.
Maybe he made some other plans.	Ebia ɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛe foforo bi.
This thing will work, right?	Saa ade yi bɛyɛ adwuma, ɛnte saa?
At least for now.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, mprempren de.
I believe you do.	Migye di sɛ woyɛ saa.
He had to head elsewhere.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde n’ani kyerɛ baabi foforo.
I am nothing without the house.	Menyɛ hwee sɛ ofie no nka ho.
This how you want it, this is how you got it.	Eyi sɛnea wopɛ no, eyi ne sɛnea wo nyaa no.
I need to talk to him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa.
He wants to not do that.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
Check back later.	Hwɛ bio akyiri yi.
I can’t do that.	Me ntumi nyɛ saa.
There are more of them than we are.	Wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ sen yɛn.
I just wanted to be me.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ me ara kwa.
Almost easy money.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ sika a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
You are one of them.	Woyɛ ne mu biako.
I would love it more with more power.	M’ani begye ho kɛse a tumi pii wom.
Everything is there in his language.	Biribiara wɔ hɔ wɔ ne kasa mu.
My father was definitely surprised.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ me papa ho dwiriw me.
That’s the kind of approach.	Ɛno ne ɔkwan a ɛte saa.
It’s just a mistake.	Ɛyɛ mfomso ara kwa.
Good evening, everyone.	Anwummere pa, obiara.
Lots of good news.	Nsɛm pa pii.
Nothing here is easy.	Biribiara nni ha a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
But interest in the work continued to grow.	Nanso adwuma no ho anigye kɔɔ so yɛɛ kɛse.
Nights can be cold in the winter.	Anadwo betumi ayɛ awɔw wɔ awɔw bere mu.
That doesn’t mean the current system is the best.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ mprempren nhyehyɛe no ne nea eye sen biara.
He painted the pictures well.	Ɔyɛɛ mfonini ahorow no ho mfonini yiye.
I hadn’t thought about that.	Ná minsusuw saa asɛm no ho.
Who owns this money?	Hena na ɔwɔ saa sika yi?
The picture itself doesn’t tell the story.	Mfonini no ankasa nka asɛm no.
Now the house is gone.	Seesei ofie no nni hɔ bio.
That’s amazing, isn’t it? 	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa, ɛnte saa?
The girl asked how the man survived.	Abeawa no bisaa sɛnea ɔbarima no nyaa nkwa no ho.
At least not perfectly.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nea edi mũ.
I am very happy with my stay.	M’ani agye yiye wɔ me tra no ho.
It was just amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
I'm perfect.	Meyɛ pɛ.
This is definitely not pretty.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi nyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
It should be such fun.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye a ɛte saa.
Don't lie though.	Nni atoro nanso.
No one else could have been a part of it so well.	Anka obi foforo biara ntumi nyɛ no fã yiye saa.
He had to be alone.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno nkutoo tra hɔ.
He could make her his favorite.	Ná obetumi de no ayɛ nea n’ani gye ho.
And he wasn’t terrible .	Na na ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hu .
And you like the way it feels.	Na w’ani gye sɛnea ɛte nka no ho.
These people are important.	Saa nnipa yi ho hia.
I love that about him.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho wɔ ne ho.
I don’t want to sleep.	Mempɛ sɛ meda.
I would have done it differently.	Anka mɛyɛ no ɔkwan foforo so.
It shouldn’t surprise us.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn nwonwa.
He looked like a child.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ abofra.
It has to be that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I have to admit it’s the best.	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye tom sɛ ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
Which is definitely not true.	Nea akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ nokware.
He who knew this said nothing.	Ɔno a na onim eyi no anka hwee.
But something in me had to do it.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ biribi a ɛwɔ me mu no yɛ.
But the kids.	Nanso mmofra no.
This is actually quite simple.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw koraa ankasa.
His attitude was always positive.	Ná n’adwene yɛ papa bere nyinaa.
He gave it to me.	Ɔde maa me.
It’s the only game in town.	Ɛno nkutoo ne agoru a ɛwɔ kurow no mu.
It was just beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa.
Content doesn’t come easy.	Nsɛm a ɛwɔ mu no mma mmerɛw.
And by the way, you are not my son.	Na ɔkwan bi so no, wonyɛ me ba.
If something is that simple, people will use it.	Sɛ biribi yɛ mmerɛw saa a, nkurɔfo de bedi dwuma.
Nobody wants to be that guy.	Obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa ɔbarima no.
We can argue later.	Yebetumi agye akyinnye akyiri yi.
He didn't know that.	Ná onnim saa asɛm no.
No one seems to want to do that.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I think he was in it.	Misusuw sɛ na ɔwɔ mu.
Money was always scarce.	Ná sika ho yɛ na bere nyinaa.
I can’t go inside, without people seeing it.	Mintumi nkɔ mu, a nkurɔfo nhu.
But I don’t do anything either.	Nanso me nso menyɛ biribiara.
It’s not really a good thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade pa ankasa.
I am not sure why.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa no yiye.
It was bitterly cold at night.	Ná awɔw wom kɛse anadwo no.
A big mistake not to make.	Mfomso kɛse a ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
Every night at night.	Anadwo biara anadwo.
And tell him why.	Na ka nea enti a ɛte saa no kyerɛ no.
But, do something for me.	Nanso, yɛ biribi ma me.
Be very, very good.	Yɛ papa paa paa.
the first said.	nea edi kan no kae.
Check out my schedule.	Hwɛ me nhyehyɛe.
Out through this door, thank you.	Fi adi fa ɔpon yi mu, meda wo ase.
I just didn’t know.	Ná minnim kɛkɛ.
Take good care of the children.	Hwɛ mmofra no yiye.
I don't know why this happened.	Minnim nea enti a eyi sii.
He has time, and he has plenty.	Ɔwɔ bere, na ɔwɔ pii.
Just one other thing.	Ade foforo biako pɛ.
This has me and me.	Eyi ama me ne me.
I just didn’t think this would work.	Na minsusuw kɛkɛ sɛ eyi bɛyɛ adwuma.
Many of the people were unemployed.	Ná nnipa no mu pii nni adwuma.
I think it was very important.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛho hia kɛse.
That didn’t matter much.	Ná ɛno ho nhia pii.
The dog was barking loudly.	Ná ɔkraman no rebɔ denneennen.
It seemed like hours.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew pii.
In this paper, we offer a new perspective.	Wɔ krataa yi mu no, yɛde adwene foforo ma.
But he shouldn’t be doing that.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Perhaps you believe the same thing.	Ebia wo nso wugye saa asɛm koro no ara di.
That’s not a sin.	Ɛno nyɛ bɔne.
Just full of life and joy.	Nkwa ne anigye ahyɛ no ma ara kwa.
And it’s still true.	Na ɛda so ara yɛ nokware.
There is a story.	Asɛm bi wɔ hɔ.
He has no idea what to do.	Onni nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ho adwene biara.
It’s too powerful.	Ɛyɛ tumi dodo.
The group relied heavily on each other.	Kuw no de wɔn ho too wɔn ho wɔn ho so kɛse.
But it’s a little easier.	Nanso ɛyɛ mmerɛw kakra.
He barely winked at them.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ wɔn.
That was huge.	Ná ɛno yɛ kɛse paa.
I understand completely.	Mete ase koraa.
And I am equal to you.	Na me ne wo yɛ pɛ.
And it was a great thing.	Na ɛyɛ ade kɛse.
He had no control over those.	Ná onni saa nneɛma no so tumi biara.
No beds to make, or chores to do.	Mpa biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ, anaa nnwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Nothing about either study should be surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ adesua abien no mu biara ho biribiara yɛ nwonwa.
But there would be enough time for that one day.	Nanso anka bere a ɛdɔɔso bɛba ama ɛno da bi.
In the foreground something was happening.	Wɔ anim no na biribi rekɔ so.
It is important for many reasons.	Nneɛma pii nti na ɛho hia.
I have to be there.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ.
This is not a temporary one.	Eyi nyɛ bere tiaa bi.
And know that it is true.	Na hu sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
But he knew he was alive.	Nanso na onim sɛ ɔte ase.
I don’t know much about it.	Minnim ho nsɛm pii.
And so will you, too.	Na saa ara na wo nso wobɛyɛ.
So why is he so unpopular?	Enti dɛn nti na nkurɔfo ani nnye ne ho saa?
This statement does not surprise me.	Saa asɛm yi nyɛ me nwonwa.
It’s his name.	Ɛyɛ ne din.
He nodded his head.	Ɔde ne ti too fam.
Or at least understand why it’s important.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, te nea enti a ɛho hia no ase.
We don’t like that idea.	Yɛn ani nnye saa adwene no ho.
A few did so.	Kakraa bi yɛɛ saa.
But it doesn’t work.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I had to be strong.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ den.
If not, say nothing.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, nka hwee.
Speak in the classroom.	Kasa wɔ adesua mu.
He slammed a note on his desk.	Ɔde krataa bi bɔɔ ne pon so.
No one can do that.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ saa.
Which that option just didn’t exist in those days.	Nea na saa kwan no nni hɔ ara kwa wɔ saa nna no mu.
Their situation was difficult.	Ná wɔn tebea no mu yɛ den.
This is the night.	Eyi ne anadwo no.
That’s what he does.	Ɛno ne nea ɔyɛ.
She leaned against him.	Ɔde ne ho too ne nkyɛn.
But otherwise, nothing.	Nanso sɛ ɛnte saa a, biribiara nni hɔ.
In a sense, it is the same here.	Ɔkwan bi so no, ɛte saa wɔ ha nso.
There was no one on the street, except the man.	Ná obiara nni abɔnten so, gye ɔbarima no nkutoo.
But at least we can say this.	Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no, yebetumi aka eyi.
And there was joy in it.	Na anigye wɔ ho.
They tell us nothing aside.	Wɔka biribiara nkyerɛ yɛn wɔ nkyɛn.
But there are few of them.	Nanso wɔn mu kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
However, this is not the case here.	Nanso, eyi nte saa wɔ ha.
But not for long.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bere tenten.
It’s absolutely amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
At the same time, strange things happened.	Bere koro no ara mu no, nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii.
So that they have to tell you again and again.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka kyerɛ wo mpɛn pii.
He almost liked her.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na n’ani gye ne ho.
None of them are going now.	Wɔn mu biara nkɔ mprempren.
Apart from the accident, you would not know the problem.	Sɛ akwanhyia no da nkyɛn a, anka wunnim ɔhaw no.
What day is it today?	Da bɛn na ɛwɔ hɔ nnɛ?
He was very interested in it.	Ná n’ani gye ho paa.
I'll tell you how it is.	Meka sɛnea ɛte no kyerɛ wo.
However, I could not see him.	Nanso, na mintumi nhu no.
I know he was probably excited.	Minim sɛ ebia na n’ani agye.
I completely agree with him.	Me ne no yɛ adwene koraa.
Most of the time he almost told me.	Mpɛn pii no na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ me.
How he will do it.	Sɛnea ɔbɛyɛ no.
But he doesn’t, either.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa, nso.
It was not a good cold.	Ná ɛnyɛ awɔw pa.
Over time, their wisdom grows.	Bere kɔ so no, wɔn nyansa yɛ kɛse.
I can make plays.	Metumi ayɛ agoru ahorow.
That’s how it should be.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
People forget this most of the time.	Nkurɔfo werɛ fi eyi bere dodow no ara.
I forget a lot too.	Me nso me werɛ fi pii.
He knew it was a long shot.	Ná onim sɛ ɛyɛ tuo tenten.
We all knew this moment would come.	Ná yɛn nyinaa nim sɛ saa bere yi bɛba.
I look at the face.	Mehwɛ anim no.
It wasn’t that kind of street.	Na ɛnyɛ abɔnten a ɛte saa.
A real book.	Nhoma ankasa.
That’s pretty much the current plan.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ne mprempren nhyehyɛe no.
I brought us here.	Mede yɛn baa ha.
I can’t imagine him in a classroom setting.	Mintumi nsusuw ne ho wɔ sukuu dan mu tebea mu.
Neither of us said a word.	Yɛn mu biara anka asɛm biara.
Take off your shoes and lie down.	Yi wo mpaboa na da fam.
She is doing her homework at a desk.	Ɔreyɛ ne fie nnwuma wɔ pon bi so.
Many had to be delivered.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde pii kɔ.
His is an interesting story.	Ne de no yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
The mind matters a lot.	Adwene no ho hia kɛse.
But it wasn’t an amazing car.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ kar a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
The music is very loud.	Nnwom no yɛ den yiye.
So it should be a fun day.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye da.
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
Their mother was right.	Ná wɔn maame asɛm no yɛ nokware.
Want to know my opinion?	Wopɛ sɛ wuhu m’adwene?
But such an approach was not without cost.	Nanso na ɔkwan a ɛte saa no nyɛ nea ɛho ka biara nni ho.
It was a happy time.	Ná saa bere no yɛ anigye.
She is a great girl.	Ɔyɛ abeawa kɛse.
All sorts of city facilities are available for.	Kurow no mu nneɛma ahorow nyinaa wɔ hɔ ma.
You should have been there.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wowɔ hɔ.
It’s just that it’s home.	Ɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fie ara kwa.
Which is amazing.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
One final test.	Sɔhwɛ biako a etwa to.
Many people did that.	Nnipa pii yɛɛ saa.
You give a man a good thing.	Wode ade pa bi ma ɔbarima.
He gives about half of what he has to give.	Ɔde nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ma no bɛyɛ fã ma.
This shouldn’t be too surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa kɛse.
That is truly remarkable.	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
It was a cold day.	Ná ɛyɛ awɔw bere.
That’s a big deal.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse.
It is even a lie to pretend to be.	Ɛyɛ atoro mpo sɛ wobɛyɛ wo ho sɛ woyɛ saa.
After all, it was only temporary.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na ɛyɛ bere tiaa mu de ara kwa.
The problem, however, is the power.	Nanso, ɔhaw no ne tumi a ɛwɔ hɔ no.
But you were there.	Nanso na wowɔ hɔ.
That is a huge risk.	Ɛno yɛ asiane kɛse.
That’s why it works.	Ɛno nti na ɛyɛ adwuma no.
That will be just as well.	Ɛno nso bɛyɛ yiye saa ara.
And the most important is risk management.	Na nea ɛho hia sen biara ne asiane ho nhyehyɛe.
I couldn’t have heard the same.	Anka mintumi nte saa ara.
I can get them for you.	Metumi anya wɔn ama wo.
There are rare species in this city.	Mmoa ahorow a wɔn ho yɛ na wɔ kurow yi mu.
When it gets hot, the water evaporates.	Sɛ ɛyɛ hyew a, nsu no tu.
He had to say it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka.
They have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
The less anyone knew about me, the better.	Dodow a na obiara nnim me ho asɛm pii no, dodow no ara na eye.
But he could do this.	Nanso na obetumi ayɛ eyi.
Always give them money.	Fa sika ma wɔn bere nyinaa.
An object exists, or it doesn’t.	Ade bi wɔ hɔ, anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
Not even their clothes.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn ntade mpo.
It’s a little too big a mistake for me.	Ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse kakra dodo ma me.
It works really well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
But neither is it.	Nanso saa ara nso na ɛnte saa.
There’s really nothing for me to do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ankasa.
That was just one dinner.	Ná ɛno yɛ anwummere aduan biako pɛ.
I wanted to be better than that.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ papa sen saa.
You are my awesome girl.	Woyɛ me abeawa a ne ho yɛ hu.
We’re all doing good here.	Yɛn nyinaa reyɛ papa wɔ ha.
I could do better than that.	Ná metumi ayɛ yiye sen saa.
In this way, the.	Wɔ saa kwan yi so.
That’s not what actually happened.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea esii ankasa.
The brainstorming session lasted two hours.	Adwene a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho no dii nnɔnhwerew abien.
You are both.	Woyɛ abien no nyinaa.
Perhaps you do too.	Ebia wo nso woyɛ saa.
I still don't care.	Meda so ara mfa me ho.
There had to be a mistake.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mfomso bi ba.
Everyone was a child.	Ná obiara yɛ abofra.
Tell him again.	Ka kyerɛ no bio.
Hope you enjoy it more than I do.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho sen me.
I know exactly where it is.	Minim baabi a ɛwɔ no yiye.
I have some important work to do.	Mewɔ adwuma bi a ɛho hia a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
This is an interesting idea.	Eyi yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ anigye.
I’m not sure.	M’ani nnye ho.
Water in the background.	Nsu a ɛwɔ akyi.
He had to do what he had to do.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
It will be like	Ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ .
Such a problem has happened before.	Ɔhaw a ɛte saa aba pɛn.
He is a very strong character.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ den yiye.
However, an honest man came nonetheless.	Nanso, ɔbarima bi a odi nokware baa hɔ ne nyinaa mu.
It’s a pleasure to be here.	Ɛyɛ anigye sɛ wowɔ ha.
He's probably home now, in bed.	Ebia ɔwɔ fie mprempren, wɔ mpa so.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He was too excited about it.	N’ani gyee ho dodo.
You can have hope.	Wubetumi anya anidaso.
No one gives talk in the street anymore.	Obiara mma kasa wɔ abɔnten so bio.
Probably some of both.	Ebia abien no nyinaa mu bi.
They are incredibly efficient.	Wɔyɛ wɔn adwuma yiye wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
As will next week.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
He was amazing.	Ɔyɛɛ nwonwa.
Nothing more important.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛho hia kɛse.
I got it right.	Me nsa kaa.
It’s his character.	Ɛyɛ ne su.
It’s a thing.	Ɛyɛ ade.
He is doing what he loves now.	Ɔreyɛ nea n’ani gye ho mprempren.
In the city approximately.	Wɔ kurow no mu a ɛbɛyɛ sɛ.
All I can say is that it seems to be going well.	Nea metumi aka ara ne sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛrekɔ so yiye.
I found a surprising number of errors.	Mihuu mfomso dodow bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
You have to believe this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye eyi di.
Anything was possible.	Ná biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye.
Can he give himself the time.	So obetumi ama ne ho bere no.
Almost no one uses this street anymore.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara mfa saa abɔnten yi nni dwuma bio.
It was a prank, if you will.	Na ɛyɛ agoru a wɔde di agoru, sɛ wopɛ a.
We had two problems.	Ná yɛwɔ ɔhaw ahorow abien.
It’s just as difficult.	Saa ara na ɛyɛ den.
Maybe he did indeed.	Ebia ɔyɛɛ saa ampa.
Maybe that’s okay though.	Ebia ɛno nyɛ hwee nanso.
Our rights suck.	Yɛn hokwan ahorow no su.
But that is not the case with you.	Nanso ɛnte saa wɔ wo fam.
In any case.	Wɔ tebea biara mu no.
That’s how it should be.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
It’s not that it’s pretty.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ.
It’s a great movie.	Ɛyɛ sini kɛse bi.
No one needs it anymore.	Obiara nhia bio.
People just expect the same thing.	Nkurɔfo hwɛ ade koro no ara kwan ara kwa.
I knew he was a bad guy.	Ná minim sɛ ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ bɔne.
He put his hand on it.	Ɔde ne nsa too so.
He doesn’t even want me.	Ɔmpɛ me mpo.
He never knew.	Ná onnim da.
It’s actually quite good.	Ɛyɛ papa koraa ankasa.
There is no music.	Nnwom biara nni hɔ.
Water was his life.	Ná nsu yɛ ne nkwa.
She knew she was beautiful but preferred books to people.	Ná onim sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ nanso na ɔpɛ nhoma sen nnipa.
I see you’re very interested.	Mihu sɛ w’ani gye ho paa.
How does this work?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na eyi yɛ adwuma?
It’s amazing that it works as a whole.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma sɛ ne nyinaa.
But it’s almost wrong.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
Walk the beautiful path.	Nantew kwan a ɛyɛ fɛ so.
He had a few problems at the time.	Ná ɔwɔ ɔhaw kakraa bi saa bere no.
It’s actually pretty cool.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
He didn’t like her.	Ná n’ani nnye ne ho.
I forget things.	Me werɛ fi nneɛma.
Maybe my mother was involved.	Ebia na me maame de ne ho ahyɛ mu.
It was nothing of the sort .	Ná ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛte saa .
This year is the first year.	Afe yi ne afe a edi kan.
For all of them.	Wɔn nyinaa fam.
But people were alert.	Nanso na nkurɔfo ani da hɔ.
He will do so.	Ɔbɛyɛ saa.
We have our own policies and procedures.	Yɛwɔ yɛn ankasa nhyehyɛe ne yɛn nhyehyɛe.
As good as it is at that point.	Sɛnea ɛyɛ papa wɔ saa bere no mu no.
I believe it does.	Migye di sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
Interesting, but hardly surprising.	Anigye, nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ nwonwa.
This is an interesting paper.	Eyi yɛ krataa a ɛyɛ anigye.
So something is going on.	Enti biribi rekɔ so.
But somewhere along the way we forgot.	Nanso wɔ kwan no so baabi no yɛn werɛ fii.
A man has to keep doing things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbarima kɔ so yɛ nneɛma.
You will get mine.	Wo nsa bɛka me de no.
It just doesn’t work.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma kɛkɛ.
It was just a girl with him.	Ná ɛyɛ abeawa bi a ɔka ne ho nkutoo.
If so, take it.	Sɛ saa a, fa.
But he does do it.	Nanso ɔyɛ saa.
Play it right.	Bɔ no yiye.
Everything was fine.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ yiye.
I feel very happy with the results.	Mete nka sɛ m’ani agye nea afi mu aba no ho yiye.
A tells you a story.	A ka asɛm bi kyerɛ wo.
There was nothing he could do.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
We also provide some of our own information.	Yɛde yɛn ankasa nsɛm no bi nso ma.
But that was never the idea.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ adwene no da.
But he knew he had to do something.	Nanso na onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
You go with him.	Wo ne no kɔ.
Your own self.	Wo ankasa no.
But at least he was alive.	Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɔte ase.
Your hand, your big hand.	Wo nsa, wo nsa kɛse no.
I have enough for both.	Mewɔ nea ɛdɔɔso ma abien no nyinaa.
This is not just for show.	Eyi nyɛ nea wɔde kyerɛ kɛkɛ.
I'm sorry, man.	Mepa wo kyɛw, ɔbarima.
And age doesn’t really matter.	Na mfe a obi adi nyɛ asɛm ankasa.
Usually, the user is presented with a set of problems.	Mpɛn pii no, wɔde ɔhaw ahorow bi ma nea ɔde di dwuma no.
Is that what you mean? 	So ɛno na wopɛ sɛ woka?
That was when they were transferred.	Ɛno yɛ bere a wɔde wɔn kɔɔ baabi foforo no.
I hope some of this book will do that for you.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ nhoma yi bi bɛyɛ saa ama wo.
No one could get me to do them.	Obiara antumi amma mayɛ wɔn.
It’s for him.	Ɛyɛ ma no.
The man looked up.	Ɔbarima no maa n’ani so.
Remember, this doesn’t apply to me.	Kae sɛ eyi mfa me ho.
This was completely untrue.	Ná eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
An idea! 	Adwene bi!
he says that.	ɔka sɛ.
Can we get our information?.	So yebetumi anya yɛn nsɛm no?.
They don’t need it anymore.	Ɛho nhia wɔn bio.
They are all equal.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
He thinks I’m beautiful.	Osusuw sɛ me ho yɛ fɛ.
Don’t do it if you don’t like it.	Mma wo nyɛ no sɛ w’ani nnye ho a.
Or at least not with him.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ ɔne no.
Take your.	Fa wo...
What a look he could do.	Hwɛ a na obetumi ayɛ.
The end of a long hard day	Da tenten a ɛyɛ den no awiei
And start crying.	Na fi ase su.
It’s one after the other.	Ɛyɛ biako akyi.
That’s also a very, very good thing.	Ɛno nso yɛ ade pa paa, paa.
It does, as long as you are here for just that.	Ɛyɛ saa, bere tenten a wowɔ ha ma ɛno ara kwa no.
He was addicted to tricycles.	Ná sakre abiɛsa a wɔde tu mmirika no ayɛ no ade.
Get him out of jail.	Yi no fi afiase.
It’s not fun, and it’s hard.	Ɛnyɛ anigye, na ɛyɛ den nso.
There is no child.	Abofra biara nni hɔ.
That other one .	Saa biako foforo no .
Part of the reason.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no fã bi.
I can work all day.	Metumi ayɛ adwuma da mũ nyinaa.
So you like music.	Enti w’ani gye nnwom ho.
Keep that in mind.	Kɔ so kae saa asɛm no.
Here on the street .	Ha wɔ abɔnten so .
You know it’s still going to play.	Wunim sɛ ɛda so ara rekɔ so abɔ.
At least it’s not that hot outside.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ hyew saa wɔ abɔnten.
It might just be anything really.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ biribiara kɛkɛ ampa.
It is a common issue.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a abu so.
We could move the table.	Ná yebetumi atu pon no akɔ baabi foforo.
And that will continue for the rest of my life.	Na ɛno bɛkɔ so wɔ me nkwa nna nyinaa mu.
Everyone should do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara yɛ saa.
Everyone has this situation too.	Obiara wɔ tebea yi nso.
You both need him.	Mo baanu nyinaa hia no.
It is complete in its nature.	Ɛyɛ nea edi mũ wɔ ne su mu.
That’s the important thing here.	Ɛno ne ade a ɛho hia wɔ ha.
It’s not really that.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ankasa.
The car accident still haunts me.	Kar akwanhyia no da so ara haw me.
But, a good kid.	Nanso, abofra pa.
A brand new build.	Ade foforo koraa a wɔde besi.
You’ll love it when you use it.	W’ani begye ho bere a wode di dwuma no.
The results are very interesting.	Nea afi mu aba no yɛ anigye yiye.
Just remember that.	Kae saa ara kɛkɛ.
You better believe it.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wugye di.
I have to take risks.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede me ho to asiane mu.
And my money is running low.	Na me sika nso ayɛ mmerɛw.

They are nice, but not necessary.	Wɔyɛ fɛ, nanso ɛho nhia.
But not what you want in this case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea wopɛ wɔ asɛm yi mu.
But this is a mistake.	Nanso eyi yɛ mfomso.
This is really important to us.	Eyi ho hia yɛn ankasa.
Think about it a lot.	Susuw ho pii.
There wasn’t much room inside.	Ná baabi pii nni mu.
I care about people.	Nnipa ho asɛm hia me.
It was an interesting letter.	Ná ɛyɛ krataa a ɛyɛ anigye.
The past is behind us.	Nea atwam no wɔ yɛn akyi.
Man, that sounds awesome.	Onipa, ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
I knew too little.	Ná minim kakraa bi dodo.
You are doing a great job here.	Woreyɛ adwuma kɛse wɔ ha.
I’m very excited about it.	M’ani agye ho yiye.
The figure turned to him, raised his hand.	Mfonini no dan kɔɔ ne nkyɛn, maa ne nsa so.
I was in good shape again.	Ná mewɔ tebea pa mu bio.
He wrapped his arms around her.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne mu.
But this is not the case.	Nanso eyi nte saa.
But even without that.	Nanso sɛ ɛno mpo nni hɔ a.
But it will be important.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛho hia.
So sorry about this.	Enti kyɛw wɔ eyi ho.
Maybe it’s the case.	Ebia ɛte saa.
And he will do it.	Na ɔbɛyɛ.
I can do this without my father.	Metumi ayɛ eyi a me papa nka ho.
Prices are not too bad.	Nneɛma bo nyɛ bɔne dodo.
It seemed like an important idea.	Ná ɛte sɛ adwene a ɛho hia.
As with my mother.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ me maame fam no.
It’s not my favorite.	Ɛnyɛ nea m’ani gye ho paa.
How they behave.	Sɛnea wɔyɛ wɔn ade.
Data are provided from three independent experiments.	Wɔde nsɛm no afi sɔhwɛ ahorow abiɛsa a wɔde wɔn ho mu na ama.
But there was no table, no bed.	Nanso na pon biara nni hɔ, na na mpa biara nni hɔ.
You have to play with it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode di agoru.
It was nice to have someone there for me.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye sɛ obi wɔ hɔ ma me.
And you know why.	Na wunim nea enti a ɛte saa.
We would use it again.	Ná yɛde bedi dwuma bio.
It is happening now.	Ɛrekɔ so mprempren.
We have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Surely he would have given them that if there was no other option.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ anka ɔde saa bɛma wɔn sɛ ɔkwan foforo biara nni hɔ a.
It was much nicer there.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ sen saa koraa wɔ hɔ.
He is working on the next project.	Ɔreyɛ adwuma a edi hɔ no.
Pictures right here.	Mfonini ahorow wɔ ha yi ara.
Summer is my favorite season.	Awɔw bere ne bere a m’ani gye ho paa.
I agree with you.	Me ne mo yɛ adwene.
Even my father.	Me papa mpo.
He gave you to you.	Ɔde wo maa wo.
I couldn’t even see it.	Ná mintumi nhu mpo.
He trusted them completely.	Ɔde ne ho too wɔn so koraa.
Every day he seems to do something new.	Ɛte sɛ nea da biara ɔyɛ biribi foforo.
For more information on this and previous models, see here.	Sɛ wopɛ eyi ne mfonini ahorow a atwam ho nsɛm pii a, hwɛ ha.
I don’t want anything to do with him anymore.	Mempɛ sɛ me ne no bɛyɛ biribi bio.
Maybe it’s too new.	Ebia ɛyɛ foforo dodo.
It doesn’t surprise me one bit.	Ɛnyɛ me nwonwa kakra.
You can’t do that with kids.	Worentumi nyɛ saa wɔ mmofra ho.
He says that it is.	Ɔka sɛ ɛte saa.
It was just everything.	Ná ɛyɛ biribiara kɛkɛ.
Attack.	To hyɛ.
Check out the photos below and to follow.	Hwɛ mfonini ahorow a ɛwɔ ase ha ne nea edi hɔ no.
It even has a door.	Ɛwɔ ɔpon mpo.
This is difficult.	Eyi yɛ den.
So why not.	Enti dɛn nti na ɛnte saa.
He looks perfect.	Ɔte sɛ nea ɔyɛ pɛ.
I got involved a lot.	Mede me ho bɔɔ ho pii.
They do indeed.	Wɔyɛ saa ampa.
Perhaps he had something important to say.	Ebia na ɔwɔ asɛm bi a ɛho hia a ɔbɛka.
But it’s not a hopeless picture.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mfonini a anidaso biara nnim.
A wonderful squirrel.	Ɔkraman a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
It’s not very obvious.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛda adi kɛse.
This should work well enough, and it does.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ, na ɛyɛ saa.
And it’s the same thing.	Na ɛyɛ ade koro no ara.
Otherwise he could even hit the hard stuff.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a na obetumi abɔ nneɛma a ɛyɛ den no mpo.
It is a test, as all life is a test.	Ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ, sɛnea nkwa nyinaa yɛ sɔhwɛ no.
Nothing makes me feel more alive.	Biribiara mma mete nka sɛ mete ase kɛse.
So if this was, you know, greatest.	Enti sɛ na eyi yɛ a, wunim, ɛyɛ kɛse sen biara.
Anything was possible there.	Ná biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye wɔ hɔ.
They are the ones.	Wɔn ni.
It was their first time ever!.	Na ɛyɛ wɔn nea edi kan koraa!.
He controls everyone but me.	Ɔno na odi obiara so gye me nkutoo.
We create the problem.	Yɛde ɔhaw no ba.
Three years later.	Mfe abiɛsa akyi.
We have beautiful children.	Yɛwɔ mma a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
Look at himself.	Hwɛ ne ho.
There are a lot of kids involved.	Mmofra pii wɔ hɔ a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu.
And maybe that’s the point.	Na ebia ɛno ne asɛm no.
But we can’t go on like that.	Nanso yɛrentumi nkɔ so saa.
She is very beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
My new shoes are very comfortable.	Me mpaboa foforo no yɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I will give you everything.	Mede biribiara bɛma wo.
I want the best for my wife and children.	Mepɛ nea eye sen biara ma me yere ne me mma.
And everything went fast, fast, fast.	Na biribiara kɔɔ ntɛmntɛm, ntɛmntɛm, ntɛmntɛm.
The beast had somehow survived, just like him.	Ná aboa no anya nkwa wɔ ɔkwan bi so, te sɛ ɔno ara pɛ.
He had something like that.	Na ɔwɔ biribi a ɛte saa.
He can be wrong about anything.	Obetumi adi mfomso wɔ biribiara ho.
A dog has sneaked in the night.	Ɔkraman bi awia anadwo.
No cars came.	Kar biara amma.
But no words came to him.	Nanso nsɛm biara amma ne nkyɛn.
Not in a week.	Ɛnyɛ dapɛn biako mu.
And they made me.	Na wowɔ me.
If the case is so.	Sɛ asɛm no yɛ saa a.
This is a very participatory learning experience.	Eyi yɛ adesua a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu kɛse.
There were good days and bad days.	Na nna pa ne nna bɔne wɔ hɔ.
Shortly thereafter, he was sent home.	Ɛno akyi bere tiaa bi no, wɔde no kɔɔ fie.
Just don’t like that one tonight.	Kɛkɛ na m’ani nnye saa biako no ho anadwo yi.
But they weren’t interested.	Nanso na wɔn ani nnye ho.
I wanted to work with you.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne wo yɛ adwuma.
The first is false now.	Nea edi kan no yɛ atoro mprempren.
That said, resources are important.	Ɛno akyi no, nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma no ho hia.
It was not an entrance party.	Ná ɛnyɛ apontow bi a wɔde kɔ mu.
He has to eat something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ odi biribi.
I couldn’t do what they did.	Na mintumi nyɛ nea wɔyɛ no.
If you like someone, tell them.	Sɛ w’ani gye obi ho a, ka kyerɛ no.
I just want to be the best.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nea eye sen biara kɛkɛ.
And so this is so for you.	Na enti eyi te saa ma mo.
Nothing feels real.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
There is so much to do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Use whatever you like.	Fa nea w’ani gye ho biara di dwuma.
How many years? 	Mfe ahe?
I was in good shape.	Ná mewɔ tebea pa mu.
I think you do that.	Misusuw sɛ woyɛ saa.
The picture is beautiful.	Mfonini no yɛ fɛ yiye.
Be the best you can be.	Yɛ nea eye sen biara a wubetumi ayɛ.
I wish he would say something, like he knew.	Me yam a anka ɔbɛka biribi, te sɛ nea onim.
They all had their eyes on him.	Ná wɔn nyinaa ani da ne so.
They have put a new one on it.	Wɔde foforo ahyɛ so.
I hadn’t thought about that.	Ná minsusuw saa asɛm no ho.
Maybe the former.	Ebia kan no.
That might have been just as good.	Ebia na ɛno nso yɛ papa saa ara.
They don’t like that.	Wɔn ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
Nobody wants anything.	Obiara mpɛ biribiara.
However, we conclude that the policy does not apply.	Nanso, yɛde ba awiei sɛ nhyehyɛe no mfa ho.
Girl looks outside.	Abeawa hwɛ abɔnten.
It was my father.	Ná ɛyɛ me papa.
They touched his hair.	Wɔde wɔn nsa kaa ne ti nhwi.
He just knew without knowing why.	Ná onim ara kwa a na onnim nea enti a onim.
We can see the end.	Yebetumi ahu awiei no.
He could handle the problem.	Ná obetumi adi ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
He is a beautiful boy.	Ɔyɛ abarimaa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
This is my favorite song.	Eyi ne dwom a m’ani gye ho paa.
I have to go, and you have to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ, na wo nso ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
I have worked on him.	Mayɛ ne ho adwuma.
Maybe he doesn’t like himself very much either.	Ebia ɔno nso mpɛ ne ho kɛse.
The handsome man asked what he could do for her.	Ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ no bisaa nea obetumi ayɛ ama no.
I'm so scared.	Me suro paa.
She is fresh and exciting.	Ɔyɛ foforo na n’ani gye.
If it works for you it works for you.	Sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma ma wo a ɛyɛ adwuma ma wo.
I have been working for a long time.	Mede bere tenten ayɛ adwuma.
You can’t go out tonight.	Worentumi nkɔ abɔnten anadwo yi.
I thought of her soft, beautiful eyes.	Misusuw n’ani a ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ fɛ no ho.
He wanted to say.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka sɛ.
That he knew me better than anyone.	Sɛ na onim me yiye sen obiara.
I also love the spaciousness of the room.	M’ani gye dan no mu kɛse no nso ho.
But we are ourselves.	Nanso yɛyɛ yɛn ankasa.
This is no good for us, or our businesses either.	Eyi nyɛ papa biara mma yɛn, anaa yɛn nnwuma nso.
Not so much for me.	Ɛnyɛ pii saa mma me.
Which is not the point at all.	Nea ɛnyɛ asɛm no koraa.
It must be awesome.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ hu.
No one can be so happy.	Obiara ntumi nnya anigye saa.
We had all the opportunities we have today back then.	Na yɛwɔ hokwan ahorow a yɛwɔ nnɛ no nyinaa saa bere no.
It would have been terrible.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ hu.
But it’s still pretty hot.	Nanso ɛda so ara yɛ hyew yiye.
He doesn’t want to be a part of it.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ne fã.
That in itself was exciting.	Ná ɛno ankasa yɛ anigye.
The whole group had left.	Ná kuw no nyinaa afi hɔ.
Don’t tell me.	Nka nkyerɛ me.
I would say the same thing.	Anka mɛka asɛm koro no ara.
Now you know my situation.	Seesei wunim me tebea no.
He had someone he thought he could trust.	Ná ɔwɔ obi a na osusuw sɛ obetumi agye no adi.
It’s his car.	Ɛyɛ ne kar.
Is this a.	So eyi yɛ.
All were spent in his room.	Wɔde ne nyinaa dii dwuma wɔ ne dan mu.
You are in the city square.	Wowɔ kurow no abɔnten so.
But there are problems.	Nanso ɔhaw ahorow wɔ hɔ.
Like anything you would talk about.	Te sɛ biribiara a wobɛka ho asɛm.
Things were getting more and more dangerous.	Ná nneɛma reyɛ ayɛ hu kɛse.
Give me a chance to be first.	Ma me hokwan a mede di kan.
The power of children.	Tumi a ɛwɔ mmofra mu.
And that’s not a big deal either.	Na ɛno nso nyɛ asɛm kɛse.
I wanted my classroom to feel like home.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me sukuu dan no te sɛ ofie.
I have every issue.	Mewɔ asɛm biara.
And it is true that time flies.	Na ɛyɛ nokware sɛ bere tu mmirika.
I finally found my father.	Awiei koraa no, mihuu me papa.
What do you say?.	Dɛn na woka?.
I felt it.	Metee nka.
She had to play a man, and the man didn’t show.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ɔbarima bi ho agoru, na ɔbarima no ankyerɛ.
For now, it is all over.	Mprempren de, ne nyinaa aba awiei.
Look at your feet.	Hwɛ wo nan so.
Its size and scale are impressive.	Ne kɛse ne ne kɛse yɛ nwonwa.
A positive attitude.	Adwene a ɛyɛ papa.
Not now, too soon.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren, ntɛm dodo.
At least not for long.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɔnyɛ saa bere tenten.
No one really knew what was going on.	Ná obiara nnim nea ɛrekɔ so ankasa.
He wanted to feel powerful.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte nka sɛ ɔwɔ tumi.
Not the way you believe it should be.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea wugye di sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no.
Play with your kids at home.	Wo ne wo mma nni agoru wɔ fie.
I really had no idea.	Ná minni ho adwene biara ankasa.

Even my mother seemed to like you.	Na ɛte sɛ nea me maame mpo ani gye wo ho.
He is an optimist!	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔwɔ anidaso!
I always do that.	Meyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
You have to be committed and invested.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho to wo ho so na wode wo sika hyɛ mu.
You or he can get a job.	Wo anaa ɔno betumi anya adwuma.
Be careful, too.	Hwɛ yiye.
It wasn't something she was doing for him.	Ná ɛnyɛ biribi a na ɔreyɛ ama no.
This is what he looks like.	Eyi ne nea ɔte sɛ.
It’s my bedroom now.	Ɛyɛ me mpa mprempren.
Close the door!	To ɔpon no mu!
Raise your hands above your head.	Ma wo nsa so wɔ wo ti so.
They might be happy.	Ebia wɔn ani begye.
I’m very excited about it.	M’ani agye ho yiye.
He’s always been such a good kid.	Ɔyɛ abofra pa a ɔte saa bere nyinaa.
Everyone knew that, and everyone knew it then.	Obiara nim saa, na na obiara nim saa bere no.
He slid his hand through hers.	Ɔde ne nsa faa ne de no mu.
You can be the best you can be.	Wubetumi ayɛ nea eye sen biara a wubetumi ayɛ.
No one else was there.	Obi foforo biara amma hɔ.
That’s another story.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo.
Time had passed.	Ná bere atwam.
If you can share it with someone, we are very happy.	Sɛ wubetumi akyɛ obi a, yɛn ani agye yiye.
This school has a good reputation.	Sukuu yi wɔ din pa.
But only for a short time.	Nanso bere tiaa bi pɛ.
I have this one.	Mewɔ eyi.
It’s a statement.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a wɔka.
And the same goes for everyone else.	Na saa ara na ɛte wɔ obiara a aka ho.
Hire people, hire people, hire people.	Fa nnipa, fa nnipa, fa nnipa.
The latter is for production.	Nea etwa to no yɛ nea wɔde yɛ nneɛma.
It would have been great.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
Take your power back.	Fa wo tumi no san kɔ.
And so did we.	Na yɛn nso.
You are the only one left.	Wo nkutoo na aka wɔ hɔ.
She wanted to forget him.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ne werɛ fi no.
It’s not us or them.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn anaa wɔn.
Generally, things are working well.	Mpɛn pii no, nneɛma no reyɛ adwuma yiye.
Children should go to school.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra kɔ sukuu.
You can’t say anything.	Worentumi nka hwee.
And he was great.	Na ɔyɛ kɛse.
Here’s how it works.	Sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma ni.
Eventually, they do.	Awiei koraa no, wɔyɛ saa.
The idea was welcomed.	Wɔde anigye gyee adwene no.
It’s not a game.	Ɛnyɛ agoru bi.
I certainly saw that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mihuu saa.
It was very simple.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Even if he has a number of exposures.	Sɛ mpo ɔwɔ nneɛma dodow bi a ɛda adi a.
Just take his name.	Fa ne din nkutoo.
A few things need to be done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nneɛma kakraa bi.
Expect more of those types of stories.	Hwɛ kwan sɛ wobɛka saa nsɛm ahorow no pii.
Someone who is not tall at all.	Obi a ɔnyɛ tenten koraa.
If you want to work, you work.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma a, woyɛ adwuma.
He spent the time looking at her.	Ɔde bere no hwɛɛ no.
You have added a lot of food to think about.	Wode aduan pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho aka ho.
There is only one problem.	Ɔhaw biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Many of us seemed to go another day early.	Ɛte sɛ nea yɛn mu pii kɔɔ da koro foforo ntɛm.
That’s the point of this book, really.	Ɛno ne nhoma yi mu asɛm, ampa.
It’s not just an idea.	Ɛnyɛ adwene bi kɛkɛ.
We only work at night.	Anadwo nkutoo na yɛyɛ adwuma.
The night was rough.	Ná anadwo no mu yɛ den.
This book sounds like such a great idea.	Saa nhoma yi te sɛ adwene kɛse a ɛte saa.
It’s not a man.	Ɛnyɛ ɔbarima.
Everyone had a job to do, everyone but him.	Na obiara wɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ, obiara gye ɔno nkutoo.
You need to take action now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho biribi mprempren.
But everyone just looked at him.	Nanso obiara hwɛɛ no ​​ara kwa.
I really enjoyed it.	M’ani gyee ho ampa.
He wasn’t playing anyway.	Na onni agoru ɔkwan biara so.
You may disagree with this view.	Ebia wo ne saa adwene yi nyɛ adwene.
You have two problems.	Wowɔ ɔhaw abien.
I'm glad it's you and not me.	M'ani agye sɛ ɛyɛ wo na ɛnyɛ me.
All went well except for those two mistakes.	Ne nyinaa kɔɔ yiye gye saa mfomso abien no nkutoo.
Take it for granted.	Fa no sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
He made a mistake.	Ɔyɛɛ mfomso.
Anyone can use that.	Obiara betumi de saa asɛm no adi dwuma.
He paced back and forth.	Ɔde ne nan kɔɔ anim ne akyi.
They put in the work.	Wɔde wɔn ho too adwuma no mu.
After all, it’s more like that.	Wɔn nyinaa akyi no, ɛte sɛ ɛno kɛse.
With this decision, he started something big.	Ɔde saa gyinae yi fii ase yɛɛ ade kɛse bi.
You really enjoyed it.	W’ani gyee ho ankasa.
For me, this is not an easy matter.	Wɔ me fam no, asɛm yi nyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
Part of it.	Ne fã bi.
But my problem is this.	Nanso me haw ne eyi.
Keep the food close to you.	Fa aduan no bɛn wo.
I stare at them.	Mehwɛ wɔn denneennen.
But it still doesn’t work.	Nanso ɛda so ara ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
Like a week late.	Te sɛ dapɛn biako a aka akyi.
I know a couple of them a little bit.	Minim wɔn mu baanu kakra.
He wanted me to take care of him.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ mehwɛ no.
I have to believe he is in some danger.	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye di sɛ ɔwɔ asiane bi mu.
And in a more dramatic way than this.	Na wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen eyi so.
And maybe someone still is.	Na ebia obi da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Many of them were terrified.	Wɔn mu pii bɔɔ hu.
She is a good girl.	Ɔyɛ abeawa pa.
And maybe it is.	Na ebia ɛte saa.
Great price for a great product.	Bo kɛse ma ade kɛse bi.
Bad, very bad.	Bɔne, bɔne paa.
Do the work, get involved.	Yɛ adwuma no, fa wo ho hyɛ mu.
Consider two years ago.	Susuw mfe abien a atwam ni no ho hwɛ.
He may be late again.	Ebia ɔbɛka akyi bio.
You have to do something with it. 	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode yɛ biribi. 
Their plan had worked too well.	Ná wɔn nhyehyɛe no ayɛ adwuma yiye dodo.
And he knew it well.	Na na onim no yiye.
I hope he does that.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I just want to make sure that’s what it is.	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ hu sɛ ɛno ne nea ɛte ara kwa.
It was hours late.	Ná aka akyi nnɔnhwerew pii.
I’d really love to see that.	M’ani begye ho ankasa sɛ mihu saa.
This is perhaps the first of its kind.	Ebia eyi ne nea edi kan wɔ ne su mu.
He told me no one was interested.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ obiara ani nnye ho.
We’ll be fine.	Yɛbɛyɛ yiye.
However, there is one flaw.	Nanso, mfomso biako wɔ mu.
He took in all the details with relative ease.	Ɔde nsɛm no nyinaa gyee adwene a na ɛnyɛ den koraa.
So they bring everything.	Enti wɔde biribiara ba.
This work is in progress.	Saa adwuma yi rekɔ so.
It’s all over now.	Ne nyinaa aba awiei mprempren.
That’s when I knew.	Saa bere no na minim.
But my mother didn’t want to.	Nanso na me maame mpɛ.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
Not so much fun.	Ɛnyɛ anigye kɛse saa.
Something similar is in the works.	Biribi a ɛte saa ara wɔ nnwuma no mu.
Take care of them.	Hwɛ wɔn yiye.
I just can’t do anything.	Mintumi nyɛ hwee kɛkɛ.
Nowadays, people are aware of these problems.	Mprempren, nkurɔfo nim ɔhaw ahorow yi.
A very handsome man.	Ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
This car is flawless.	Saa kar yi nni mfomso biara.
It’s just not true in our minds.	Ɛnyɛ nokware kɛkɛ wɔ yɛn adwene mu.
But how do they do that.	Nanso ɔkwan bɛn so na wɔyɛ saa.
You have to be in really good shape.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wowɔ tebea pa mu ankasa.
I knew this was true.	Ná minim sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
My hair feels great.	Me ti nhwi te nka sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ.
If this continues and I think it will.	Sɛ eyi kɔ so na misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa a.
That statement is true.	Saa asɛm no yɛ nokware.
But that doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ hwee.
We can do that.	Yebetumi ayɛ saa.
How can we help these people?	Yɛbɛyɛ dɛn aboa saa nkurɔfo yi?
He looked big and scary.	Ná ɔte sɛ kɛse na ne ho yɛ hu.
How can you get him to do this?'	Wobɛyɛ dɛn ama wayɛ eyi?’.
The police have been looking at pictures.	Polisifo no ahwɛ mfonini ahorow so.
This could be over.	Eyi betumi aba awiei.
Can you please help me with that.	Mesrɛ wo, wubetumi aboa me wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
It is a system.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
None of them made this list.	Wɔn mu biara anyɛ saa din yi.
I knew him well.	Ná minim no yiye.
It’s a fake.	Ɛyɛ atoro.
You can’t be me.	Worentumi nyɛ me.
Moreover, the reasons are stated.	Bio nso, wɔka nea enti a ɛte saa.
This in itself is not surprising.	Eyi ankasa nyɛ nwonwa.
I’m so proud of you.	M’ani gye wo ho saa.
I did really well in the final.	Meyɛɛ yiye ankasa wɔ nea etwa to no mu.
The idea was unpleasant to him.	Ná adwene no yɛ nea n’ani nnye ho.
Something like that.	Biribi a ɛte saa.
Not one word told anyone about these things.	Asɛm biako mpo ankyerɛ obiara wɔ saa nneɛma yi ho.
Like himself.	Te sɛ ɔno ankasa.
In this case, there is only one condition.	Wɔ eyi mu no, tebea biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Who knows, it might work.	Hena na onim, ebia ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
What is the issue today?	Dɛn ne asɛm no nnɛ?
He wants to do it for you.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ma wo.
Now we can’t do it anymore.	Seesei yɛrentumi nyɛ bio.
But most people never do.	Nanso nnipa dodow no ara nyɛ saa da.
Can you tell me where that is?	So wubetumi akyerɛ me baabi a ɛno wɔ?
Clearly, it is not.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
It’s a great job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
We have it under him.	Yɛwɔ no ase.
I can’t see the problem.	Me ntumi nhu ɔhaw no.
We were both children.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛ mmofra.
If he was doing that.	Sɛ na ɔyɛ saa a.
We need to do something about it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi.
Or not at the time of day he wanted.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ da no mu bere a na ɔpɛ no.
Find out why	Hu nea enti a .
this is part of the job I really enjoy.	eyi yɛ adwuma a m’ani gye ho ankasa no fã.
If he kept his head down.	Sɛ ɔde ne ti too fam a.
It seemed too good to be true.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eye dodo.
He had lost sight of the street.	Ná n’ani afi abɔnten so.
It wasn’t a problem.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɔhaw biara.
That seems likely to be the problem.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
Like, than, like.	Te sɛ, sen sɛ, te sɛ.
His wife could be a mutual acquaintance.	Ná ne yere betumi ayɛ obi a onim wɔn ho wɔn ho.
Like a meeting.	Te sɛ nhyiam.
It still needs some work.	Ɛda so ara hia adwuma bi.
The pictures are simple.	Mfonini ahorow no yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
This shouldn’t be surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa.
He wants to do some things, but not too much.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nneɛma bi, nanso ɛnyɛ pii dodo.
And that’s a little weird.	Na ɛno yɛ nwonwa kakra.
To discuss the matter.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɔbɛka asɛm no ho asɛm.
You have gorgeous hair.	Wowɔ ti nhwi a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Do those three.	Yɛ saa abiɛsa no.
I can’t do that today.	Mintumi nyɛ saa nnɛ.
It was all the same for us.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ ade koro ma yɛn.
Your presence on the ground, is important.	Wo a wowɔ hɔ wɔ fam, ho hia.
He’s good and he’s fast.	Ɔyɛ papa na ɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
It doesn’t work for me.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma mma me.
It should be beautiful.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ.
Apparently, it wasn’t him.	Ɛda adi sɛ, na ɛnyɛ ɔno.
He hoped some work might come into play.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ebia adwuma bi bɛba mu.
I didn’t even know what it was.	Ná minnim nea ɛyɛ mpo.
Everyone said that.	Obiara kaa saa.
Check out the full picture below!.	Hwɛ mfonini no nyinaa wɔ ase ha!.
I totally get that.	Me nsa ka saa koraa.
He could fill her.	Ná obetumi ahyɛ no ma.
He was bitten by a snake yesterday.	Ɔwɔ bi kaa no nnɛra.
And a good one, at that.	Na obi a ɔyɛ papa, wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
There is a lot of water here.	Nsu pii wɔ ha.
So, good for them too!.	Enti, eye ma wɔn nso!.
He would do it.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ.
His father, for one.	Ne papa, ma biako.
And the next day, too.	Na ɛda a edi hɔ no nso.
Nothing at all has been easy.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ayɛ mmerɛw koraa.
He didn't have much to say.	Ná onni nsɛm pii a ɔbɛka.
So what you do is think of someone else.	Enti nea woyɛ ne sɛ wususuw obi foforo ho.
However, his father doesn’t want to.	Nanso, ne papa mpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Music can do that.	Nnwom betumi ayɛ saa.
The girl was unconscious.	Ná abeawa no nnim hwee.
This is the point.	Eyi ne asɛm no.
It seemed almost enough.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛdɔɔso.
I thought that was not widely known.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno nyɛ nea nnipa pii nim.
I had no reason otherwise.	Ná minni biribiara a enti ɛnte saa.
He didn't know what to make of it all.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛyɛ wɔ ne nyinaa ho.
This was his habit.	Ná eyi yɛ ne su.
Please let more of my bad name say even better things.	Mesrɛ wo ma me din bɔne pii ka nsɛm pa mpo.
I was so hot.	Ná me ho ayɛ hyew kɛse.
It’s convenient, too.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw, nso.
I did more than anyone else would.	Meyɛɛ pii sen sɛnea obiara bɛyɛ.
He is not at all nice.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ koraa.
There is no transportation.	Kar biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛkɔ.
Eventually, he would tell her.	Awiei koraa no, na ɔbɛka akyerɛ no.
Don’t come into my room.	Mma mma me dan mu.
Please keep going.	Mesrɛ wo, kɔ so.
It is a really great book.	Ɛyɛ nhoma kɛse ankasa.
It seems strange.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There are weak ones, who do just that.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ mmerɛw wɔ hɔ, a wɔyɛ saa nkutoo.
I had given the game away.	Ná mede agoru no ama.
But the first mistake was not his.	Nanso mfomso a edi kan no nyɛ ne de.
But that was his first against his new team.	Nanso ɛno ne nea edi kan a ɔne ne kuw foforo no dii.
They do just what we would do in their situation.	Wɔyɛ nea anka yɛbɛyɛ wɔ wɔn tebea no mu no ara pɛ.
The man said he wasn’t happy.	Ɔbarima no kae sɛ n’ani nnye.
It was simple and easy.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛnyɛ den.
Not even last year.	Ɛnyɛ afe a etwaam no mpo.
That’s obviously your chance.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛno ne wo hokwan.
Not that he didn’t care.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛnyɛ no asɛm.
We really like the team.	Yɛn ani gye kuw no ho ankasa.
He should have been in there with her.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne no kɔ mu wɔ hɔ.
It seems to be difficult.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
And not much if you can.	Na ɛnyɛ pii sɛ wubetumi a.
You’re doing it again.	Woreyɛ no bio.
This is a very important one.	Eyi yɛ nea ɛho hia yiye.
This is not a necessity at all.	Eyi nyɛ ade a ɛho hia koraa.
It had started well enough.	Ná afi ase yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Take them inside.	Fa wɔn kɔɔ mu.
What is the value of the 100% satisfaction rate? 	Dɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ?
Your team will perform better when they are also practicing.	Wo kuw no bɛyɛ adwuma yiye bere a wɔn nso reyɛ wɔn ho no.
I didn’t know when you would.	Na minnim bere a wobɛyɛ saa.
I can’t find those books.	Mintumi nnya saa nhoma ahorow no.
His mind was not clear.	Ná n’adwene mu nna hɔ.
I am the present one.	Me ne obi a ɔwɔ hɔ mprempren.
A positive attitude is very important.	Adwene pa ho hia paa.
I want that to be amazing.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
The hands are smooth.	Nsa no yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
More details to come later!.	Nsɛm pii bɛba akyiri yi!.
You are the one who makes them.	Wo na woyɛ wɔn.
Things are complicated.	Nneɛma mu yɛ den.
I knew this was a big problem.	Ná minim sɛ eyi yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
You can never get out again.	Worentumi mfi adi bio da.
His head was hurting.	Ná ne ti yɛ no yaw.
The children wear school uniforms.	Mmofra no hyɛ sukuu ntade.
Not even a stranger.	Ɛnyɛ obi a onnim no mpo.
They both knew the truth.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa nim nokware no.
That’s what’s happening here.	Ɛno ne nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha.
A job he enjoyed.	Adwuma a na n’ani gye ho.
He organized this study.	Ɔyɛɛ adesua yi ho nhyehyɛe.
This is the present.	Eyi ne mprempren.
But his new perspective.	Nanso n’adwene foforo no.
For us, it was amazing.	Wɔ yɛn fam no, na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He can take good care of himself.	Obetumi ahwɛ ne ho yiye.
I am always working.	Meyɛ adwuma bere nyinaa.
Do what they say.	Yɛ nea wɔka no.
But they were good at what they did.	Nanso na wɔn ho akokwaw wɔ nea wɔyɛ no mu.
The book was fun and very popular.	Ná nhoma no yɛ anigye na na nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse.
If you do that.	Sɛ woyɛ saa a.
It’s actually in their name.	Ɛwɔ wɔn din mu ankasa.
See pricing schedule.	Hwɛ nneɛma bo nhyehyɛe.
Each house has one bedroom.	Ofie biara wɔ mpa biako.
I have to go so bad.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ bɔne saa.
That’s only part of the story.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm no fã bi kɛkɛ.
Don’t tell anyone that.	Nka saa nkyerɛ obiara.
The party needed his help, badly.	Ná apontow no hia ne mmoa, kɛse.
It was interesting, no doubt, but no big deal.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye, akyinnye biara nni ho, nanso na ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse biara.
Maybe those three things are the whole story.	Ebia saa nneɛma abiɛsa no ne asɛm no nyinaa.
However, the system seems to work quite well.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea nhyehyɛe no yɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
A lot of work is in vain.	Adwuma pii yɛ kwa.
There is no one else.	Obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
Be the subject of the story.	Yɛ asɛm no ho asɛm.
Here is a letter.	Krataa bi ni.
This is not your child.	Eyi nyɛ wo ba.
That is the	Ɛno ne .
She looked so beautiful.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
All you can do is you.	Nea wubetumi ayɛ ara ne wo.
Most of the time there was no problem.	Mpɛn pii no na ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
That dog is great!	Saa ɔkraman no yɛ kɛse!
It’s the way it is.	Ɛyɛ sɛnea ɛte.
That alone is exciting.	Ɛno nkutoo yɛ anigye.
But he had to say something.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka asɛm bi.
Inside is you.	Wɔ mu ne wo.
My last week was the first.	Me dapɛn a etwa to no ne nea edi kan.
It didn’t matter much.	Ná ɛho nhia pii.
I don’t know that for sure.	Minnim saa asɛm no yiye.
However, he did.	Nanso, ɔyɛɛ saa.
Look at it my way.	Hwɛ no me kwan so.
In time, the seeds will be there.	Bere kɔ so no, aba no bɛba hɔ.
You can make things happen more or less frequently.	Wubetumi ama nneɛma akɔ so mpɛn pii anaa kakraa bi.
I think it has to be something like that.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
I have to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
Every day was the same.	Ná da biara yɛ ade koro.
I should have thought about the money.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw sika no ho.
It will be busy here.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea adagyew nnim wɔ ha.
And it might be good.	Na ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa.
This movie says that people want to do something better.	Sini yi ka sɛ nkurɔfo pɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi a eye sen saa.
I wish you were real.	Me yam a anka woyɛ obi ankasa.
Be very careful!	Hwɛ yiye paa!
This is also not true.	Eyi nso nyɛ nokware.
He just made a mistake.	Ɔyɛɛ mfomso ara kwa.
That was a daunting task.	Ná ɛno yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ hu.
But we are those forces.	Nanso yɛn na yɛyɛ saa tumi ahorow no.
And for the same reason.	Ná nea enti a ɛte saa ara.
I really need to work on that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa adwuma no ho adwuma ankasa.
I am very, very good.	Meyɛ papa paa paa.
I would have loved it.	Anka m’ani begye ho.
And all his friends too.	Na ne nnamfo nyinaa nso.
The same thing again.	Ade koro no ara bio.
He does that now.	Ɔyɛ saa mprempren.
The population continued to grow.	Nnipa dodow no kɔɔ so yɛɛ kɛse.
And some pictures.	Na mfonini ahorow bi nso.
They give him the last of their water.	Wɔde wɔn nsu a etwa to no ma no.
Keep doing this.	Kɔ so yɛ eyi.
His mother more than his father.	Ne maame pii sen ne papa.
This is our city.	Eyi ne yɛn kurow.
I can’t get enough of it.	Mintumi nnya nea ɛdɔɔso.
And it probably didn’t matter.	Na ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛnyɛ hwee.
This species has no other species of its size.	Saa mmoa yi nni mmoa foforo biara a wɔn ho te sɛ wɔn kɛse.
Or so they seem to.	Anaasɛ ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ saa.
He would have been amazing in that job.	Anka ɔbɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ saa adwuma no mu.
It was really, really hard to hang out with this group.	Na ɛyɛ den ankasa, ankasa sɛ wo ne kuw yi bɛbɔ.
Everybody who is everybody is there.	Obiara a ɔyɛ obiara no wɔ hɔ.
Check us out now.	Hwɛ yɛn mprempren.
It was hard for him to deal with me.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma no sɛ me ne no bedi.
He wants to be faster in the summer.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm wɔ awɔw bere mu.
He was the power.	Ná ɔno ne tumi no.
It’s never been that easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa da.
This problem has been going on for too long.	Saa ɔhaw yi akɔ so akyɛ dodo.
We are just in it.	Yɛwɔ mu ara kwa.
It was like a game.	Ná ɛte sɛ agoru bi.
He was looming over all of them.	Ná ɔreyɛ kɛse wɔ wɔn nyinaa so.
But winter comes too fast.	Nanso awɔw bere no ba ntɛmntɛm dodo.
There is a great story behind this.	Asɛm kɛse bi wɔ eyi akyi.
Does anyone know anything?	So obi nim biribi?
In most cases.	Mpɛn pii no.
He didn’t like clothes.	Ná n’ani nnye ntade ho.
And he was a child.	Na na ɔyɛ abofra.
This is a busy part of town.	Eyi yɛ kurow no fã a adagyew nnim.
However, that is not the situation here.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno ne tebea a ɛwɔ ha no.
Nothing goes in, nothing goes in.	Biribiara nkɔ mu, biribiara nkɔ mu.
But he wasn’t in time.	Nanso na onni bere mu.
Check out the whole thing.	Hwɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
Take him and see if he has any money.	Fa no kɔ na hwɛ sɛ ɔwɔ sika bi anaa.
I understood them.	Metee wɔn ase.
On the other hand, it might be interesting.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ebia ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
I like both of those things, too.	M’ani gye saa nneɛma abien no nyinaa ho, nso.
This must have played a role.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ eyi dii dwuma bi.
And you can use them to build many things.	Na wubetumi de wɔn asi nneɛma pii.
The children had arrived at their new home.	Ná mmofra no adu wɔn fie foforo no mu.
We are at his house later that night.	Yɛwɔ ne fie akyiri yi saa anadwo no.

That’s the whole point of this article.	Ɛno ne asɛm yi nyinaa mu asɛm.
Something went wrong here.	Biribi anyɛ yiye wɔ ha.
Who owns this house?	Hena na ɔwɔ saa ofie yi?
Very good news.	Asɛm pa ara.
Remember those things.	Kae saa nneɛma no.
Me and my children.	Me ne me mma.
He was sentenced to one year in prison.	Wɔde no too afiase afe biako.
And a cold one, too.	Na awɔw bi nso.
This is the first condition.	Eyi ne tebea a edi kan.
My really big one.	Me kɛse ankasa.
Things are going well.	Nneɛma rekɔ so yiye.
But it seems unlikely.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
It was cold.	Ná awɔw wom.
Almost forgotten.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔn werɛ afi.
However, that’s never the best idea.	Nanso, ɛno nyɛ adwene a eye sen biara da.
Finally, the plan was put in place.	Awiei koraa no, wɔde nhyehyɛe no sii hɔ.
I've been using it.	Mede ayɛ adwuma.
It was easier that way.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa kwan no so.
He looks like a child.	Ɔte sɛ abofra.
I have a classroom.	Mewɔ adesua dan.
That is not the point of this article.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm yi mu asɛm.
Or maybe it’s not.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
However, he is weak.	Nanso, ɔyɛ mmerɛw.
Just warm up really well.	Kɛkɛ ma wo ho yɛ hyew yiye ankasa.
It’s exciting and scary at the same time.	Ɛyɛ anigye na ɛyɛ hu bere koro no ara mu.
It had been so long ago.	Ná akyɛ saa.
License only.	Tumi krataa nkutoo.
Then and now.	Saa bere no ne mprempren.
It’s all here in this post.	Ne nyinaa wɔ ha wɔ krataa yi mu.
He wants me to keep working.	Ɔpɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ adwuma.
Three days ago.	Nnansa a atwam ni.
Follow that car!	Di saa kar no akyi!
There are complete things.	Nneɛma a edi mũ wɔ hɔ.
One of them was about jobs.	Ná wɔn mu biako fa nnwuma ho nsɛm ho.
All the good stuff.	Nneɛma pa nyinaa.
I know you, but don't go into town much anymore.	Minim wo, nanso nkɔ kurow no mu pii bio.
How did the accident happen?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na akwanhyia no sii?
Three copies were given to him.	Wɔde bi abiɛsa maa no.
More on this soon.	Eyi ho nsɛm pii nnansa yi ara.
It’s something for next year, maybe.	Ɛyɛ biribi ma afe a edi hɔ no, ebia.
I have something to say.	Mewɔ asɛm bi a mɛka.
And everyone seems to forget that.	Na ɛte sɛ nea obiara werɛ fi saa asɛm no.
So that’s one thing.	Enti ɛno yɛ ade biako.
There are a few of them right here.	Wɔn mu kakraa bi na ɛwɔ ha yi ara.
He was out there for days.	Ná ɔwɔ abɔnten hɔ nna pii.
And music itself.	Na nnwom ankasa nso.
And this is why it is.	Na eyi nti na ɛte saa.
I am doing quite well.	Mereyɛ yiye koraa.
You can’t be more wrong.	Worentumi nyɛ mfomso pii sen saa.
There are two reasons why this should be so.	Nneɛma abien nti na ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ saa.
Legs and back and arms.	Nan ne akyi ne nsa.
But we can talk about it later.	Nanso yebetumi aka ho asɛm akyiri yi.
But if all goes well .	Nanso sɛ ne nyinaa kɔ yiye a .
My honest opinion is, it’s not very pretty.	M’adwene a ɛyɛ nokware ne sɛ, ɛnyɛ fɛ yiye.
I feel so happy.	Mete nka sɛ m’ani agye paa.
Finally, let it do most of the work.	Awiei koraa no, ma ɛnyɛ adwuma dodow no ara.
I couldn’t quite understand the meaning of his words.	Na mintumi nte nea ne nsɛm no kyerɛ ase yiye.
He had done this.	Ná wayɛ eyi.
This city is famous for its music scene.	Saa kurow yi agye din wɔ nnwom a ɛwɔ mu no ho.
His mother was right.	Ná ne maame asɛm no yɛ nokware.
Now it is almost there.	Mprempren ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
No one is behind us.	Obiara nni yɛn akyi.
I'm sorry for the.	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ...
It still doesn’t get it.	Ɛda so ara nnya bi.
Even when we are alone, we are never alone.	Sɛ yɛn nkutoo na yɛwɔ mpo a, yɛn nkutoo nyɛ yɛn ho da.
But no one does that.	Nanso obiara nyɛ saa.
I think it would work.	Misusuw sɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
Last year is in the past.	Afe a etwaam no yɛ nea atwam.
Beat until smooth.	Bɔ no kosi sɛ ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
That would be good.	Ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
But that was a good picture.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ mfonini pa.
No one was there anymore.	Ná obiara nte hɔ bio.
Hopefully it will work in production.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma wɔ nneɛma a wɔyɛ mu.
It has a lot to say.	Ɛwɔ nsɛm pii ka.
I want to do this as much as he does.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi sɛnea ɔno nso yɛ no.
So this is how it is delivered.	Enti eyi ne sɛnea wɔde ma no.
However, I worked with them.	Nanso, me ne wɔn yɛɛ adwuma.
The opportunity may also come later.	Hokwan no nso betumi aba akyiri yi.
I thought it was you.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ wo.
I was convinced.	Ná migye di.
We are better than this.	Yɛyɛ papa sen eyi.
That would be a really good point.	Ɛno bɛyɛ asɛm pa ankasa.
He sits in the front.	Ɔte anim hɔ.
But it was still fun.	Nanso na ɛda so ara yɛ anigye.
I am so sorry to everyone.	Mepa obiara kyɛw kɛse.
The hairstyle is simple and elegant.	Sɛnea wɔyɛ ti nhwi no yɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ fɛ.
My thoughts, my thoughts.	M’adwene, m’adwene.
He was definitely not feeling well today.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ne ho nyɛ no den nnɛ.
I want to go to the gym.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ.
I do tests.	Meyɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow.
The system is good.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛ papa.
Summer is finally starting to build.	Awiei koraa no, awɔw bere afi ase reyɛ kɛse.
And boy, do they ever.	Na abarimaa, so wɔyɛ saa da.
He only wanted to touch it.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka nkutoo.
I am here because of you.	Wo nti na mewɔ ha.
It’s not like that.	Ɛnyɛ saa.
Go into the main house.	Kɔ ofie kɛse no mu.
There was no reason for it here.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa wɔ ha.
Or there’s something in them.	Anaasɛ biribi wɔ wɔn mu.
It is important to know why.	Ɛho hia sɛ wuhu nea enti a ɛte saa.
For you, it’s the latter.	Wɔ wo fam no, ɛyɛ nea etwa to no.
It’s very important.	Ɛho hia paa.
I will take him with me.	Mede no bɛka me ho.
But it’s only two days.	Nanso ɛyɛ nna abien pɛ.
You are a human being.	Woyɛ onipa.
There must be something he can do to help her.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a obetumi ayɛ de aboa no.
He thought no one knew.	Ná osusuw sɛ obiara nnim.
Again there are two reasons for this.	Bio nso nea enti a eyi ba ne nneɛma abien.
And you know, we can’t do too much with this.	Na wunim, yɛrentumi mfa eyi nyɛ pii dodo.
Give it a week.	Ma no dapɛn biako.
I hit him really hard.	Mede no bɔɔ denneennen ankasa.
These days, most people live in a city.	Nna yi, nnipa dodow no ara te kurow bi mu.
I love systems.	M’ani gye nhyehyɛe ahorow ho.
Like it wasn’t really happening.	Te sɛ nea na ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so ankasa.
Even if you are alone.	Sɛ wo nkutoo na wowɔ mpo a.
People are interested in him.	Nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho.
No one knows why.	Obiara nnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
We drove for hours.	Yɛde nnɔnhwerew pii kaa kar.
No chance of that happening here.	Hokwan biara nni hɔ sɛ ɛno bɛba wɔ ha.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
In trouble, no doubt.	Wɔ ɔhaw mu, akyinnye biara nni ho.
Don’t be afraid of it.	Mma w’ani nnye ho.
For many reasons.	Nneɛma pii nti.
No idea if that is true.	Adwene biara nni ho sɛ ebia ɛno yɛ nokware anaa.
He lives on the outskirts of town.	Ɔte kurow no akyi.
He didn’t need to be there.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ.
One knows them immediately.	Obi nim wɔn ntɛm ara.
I couldn’t make her be like my mother.	Na mintumi mma ɔnyɛ sɛ me maame.
He didn't know what he wanted to say.	Ná onnim nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka.
His fault or not, he had everything.	Ne mfomso anaasɛ ɛnte saa no, na ɔwɔ biribiara.
It is also available in different languages.	Ɛwɔ hɔ nso wɔ kasa ahorow mu.
I have been doing that for years.	Mede mfe pii ayɛ saa.
It was really hard.	Ná ɛyɛ den ankasa.
We will work on it.	Yɛbɛyɛ ho adwuma.
Hopefully the movie works.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ sini no bɛyɛ adwuma.
It’s good for the child.	Ɛyɛ papa ma abofra no.
This really shouldn't have caused problems.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi de ɔhaw ahorow ba ankasa.
He is not a terrible person.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hu.
So, there is no doubt that these things happened.	Enti, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ saa nneɛma yi sii.
We who are down here.	Yɛn a yɛwɔ fam ha.
It must be a lot of fun.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
There was more traffic on the road than ever before.	Ná kar pii wɔ kwan no so sen bere biara.
But this can go too far.	Nanso eyi betumi akɔ akyiri dodo.
Don’t talk about it anymore.	Nka ho asɛm bio.
This affects all of us.	Eyi ka yɛn nyinaa.
I could barely process it, barely think about it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nyɛ ho adwuma, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nsusuw ho.
No one ever told me.	Obiara anka ankyerɛ me da.
But that day never came.	Nanso saa da no amma da.
Use a thorough approach.	Fa ɔkwan a edi mũ di dwuma.
I can do this.	Metumi ayɛ eyi.
However, he was somehow interested.	Nanso, na n’ani gyee ho wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
I'm sure you'll be just fine.	Migye di sɛ wobɛyɛ yiye ara kwa.
It’s not a simple thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
And he was interested in me.	Na n’ani gyee me ho.
I will add some pictures soon.	Mede mfonini ahorow bi bɛka ho nnansa yi ara.
That was how things usually went.	Saa na na nneɛma taa kɔ so.
However, that is what is happening.	Nanso, ɛno ne nea ɛrekɔ so.
And you’re just as involved as I am.	Na wo nso wode wo ho ahyɛ mu te sɛ me ara pɛ.
He has nothing to do with that, nothing to do with that.	Ɔne saa asɛm no nni hwee yɛ, onni saa asɛm no ho hwee yɛ.
He looked the same as he does now.	Ná ne ho te sɛ nea ɔte mprempren no ara pɛ.
Most people think it’s too hard.	Nnipa dodow no ara susuw sɛ ɛyɛ den dodo.
This was his thinking.	Ná eyi ne n’adwene a na osusuw ho.
Maybe he’ll be happy.	Ebia n’ani begye.
Lots and lots of awesomeness.	Pii ne pii a ɛyɛ hu.
Nothing much he could do until then.	Biribiara nni hɔ pii a na obetumi ayɛ de besi saa bere no.
When they are young, they are full of life.	Sɛ wɔyɛ mmofra a, nkwa ahyɛ wɔn ma.
Or even both of them.	Anaasɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa mpo.
He didn't want to do that.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
It was really a lot of information.	Ná ɛyɛ nsɛm pii ankasa.
Everything else was great.	Ná biribiara a aka no yɛ kɛse.
This is a very important factor.	Eyi yɛ ade a ɛho hia yiye.
There were two police officers.	Ná polisifo baanu bi wɔ hɔ.
He certainly didn’t have time.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na onni bere.
But he had to do that.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
It’s not that easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
At the time, everything seemed possible.	Saa bere no, na ɛte sɛ nea biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye.
He looked at the picture with interest.	Ɔde anigye hwɛɛ mfonini no.
His numbers were not good.	Ná ne dodow nyɛ papa.
And he was powerless, powerless.	Na na onni tumi, na onni tumi.
It will be good for everyone.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa ama obiara.
It doesn’t really matter to me.	Ɛnyɛ me asɛm ankasa.
This was just another game.	Ná eyi yɛ agoru foforo ara kwa.
You definitely bring suspense to the story.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wode asɛm no mu nsɛm a ɛyɛ hu ba.
He is much stronger than that.	Ɔyɛ den sen saa kɛse.
It will just be for tonight.	Ɛbɛyɛ anadwo yi de ara kwa.
His head pounded violently.	Ne ti bɔɔ denneennen.
I can’t do it alone.	Me nkutoo ntumi nyɛ.
Age doesn’t matter.	Mfe a obi adi no ho nhia.
They were taken to police custody.	Wɔde wɔn kɔɔ polisifo afiase.
Someone like ourselves, perhaps.	Obi a ɔte sɛ yɛn ankasa, ebia.
You should have seen the look on their faces.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu sɛnea wɔn anim te.
So no one here is not here.	Enti obiara nni ha a onni ha.
Very few people are good at this.	Nnipa kakraa bi pɛ na wɔn ho akokwaw wɔ eyi mu.
This is their story.	Eyi ne wɔn asɛm.
There was no money for that.	Ná sika biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ saa.
Nothing is powerful.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛwɔ tumi.
Make the most of what you can do.	Fa nea wubetumi ayɛ no di dwuma yiye.
It was pretty fast.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm yiye.
I felt like I was doing something wrong.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ bɔne bi.
You are on the books.	Wowɔ nhoma ahorow no so.
He gave it to me.	Ɔde maa me.
This is what happened here tonight.	Eyi ne nea esii wɔ ha anadwo yi.
I don't know how to do this.	Minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ eyi.
You can never know.	Worentumi nhu da.
But most are just awful.	Nanso dodow no ara yɛ hu ara kwa.
Her mother was not one for books.	Ná ne maame nyɛ biako mma nhoma.
We love desserts.	Yɛn ani gye aduan a wɔde yɛ aduan ho.
I would still have my kids.	Anka meda so ara wɔ me mma.
The dog ate my homework.	Ɔkraman no dii me fie nnwuma.
It’s not really there.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
It was a real learning curve for me.	Ná ɛyɛ adesua kwan ankasa ma me.
They say it was just like a better movie.	Wɔka sɛ na ɛte sɛ sini bi kɛkɛ a eye sen saa.
He should never be equal to her.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔne no yɛ pɛ da.
There is only one problem.	Ɔhaw biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
The real problem is the pace of the story.	Ɔhaw ankasa ne sɛnea asɛm no kɔ so ntɛmntɛm no.
A door slammed into the house.	Ɔpon bi bɔɔ fie hɔ.
No one could do anything with it but me personally.	Obiara antumi mfa nyɛ hwee gye me ankasa.
Not a room, a bed.	Ɛnyɛ dan, mpa.
And so you will do.	Na saa ara na wobɛyɛ.
After that, it was all clear.	Ɛno akyi no, na ne nyinaa mu da hɔ.
And he had done so.	Na na wayɛ saa.
I could barely see my feet.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nhu me nan.
It was something that had to be said.	Ná ɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka.
So there were problems with the party.	Enti na ɔhaw ahorow wɔ apontow no mu.
But not everyone was so keen on that.	Nanso ɛnyɛ obiara na na n’ani gye saa asɛm no ho saa.
No one knew what to do.	Ná obiara nnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
That is out of my control right now.	Ɛno nni me tumi mprempren.
If you are there do something else come back.	Sɛ wowɔ hɔ a yɛ biribi foforo san ba.
You are in this story.	Wowɔ saa asɛm yi mu.
They are an active user.	Wɔyɛ obi a ɔde di dwuma denneennen.
He has a job.	Ɔwɔ adwuma bi.
That’s their whole point.	Ɛno ne wɔn asɛm no nyinaa.
That is today.	Ɛno ne nnɛ.
I can do something completely different.	Me tumi yɛ biribi foforo koraa.
And if so, what their intentions are.	Na sɛ ɛte saa a, nea wɔn adwene yɛ.
He had been good to me.	Ná wayɛ me yiye.
But just look at this thing.	Nanso hwɛ ade yi ara kwa.
It’s another significant number.	Ɛyɛ dodow foforo a ɛho hia.
That was the case at the time.	Saa bere no na ɛte saa.
Not so in this book.	Ɛnte saa wɔ nhoma yi mu.
That it is strange to us.	Sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa ma yɛn.
Lots of books.	Nhoma pii.
I agree with that.	Migye saa asɛm no tom.
They are powerful things.	Wɔyɛ nneɛma a tumi wom.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
One day at a time.	Da koro bi.
First to no gun.	Di kan to no tuo.
Become.	Bɛyɛ.
I just couldn’t believe myself.	Ná mintumi nnye me ho nni kɛkɛ.
I know him very well.	Minim no yiye.
However, most businesses remained closed.	Nanso, nnwuma dodow no ara kɔɔ so too mu.
It’s a.	Ɛyɛ a.
I can’t believe there’s anything else.	Me ntumi nnye nni sɛ biribi foforo biara wɔ hɔ.
So much going on, so much to do.	Nneɛma pii a ɛrekɔ so, nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
It’s totally, painfully wrong.	Ɛyɛ mfomso koraa, a ɛyɛ yaw.
He got one, too.	Ɔno nso nyaa biako.
To do that again and again.	Sɛ wobɛyɛ saa bio bio.
' that '.	' a '.
It’s hard to tell.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka.
But this is not about that.	Nanso eyi nyɛ ɛno ho asɛm.
I don’t want to know anything about them.	Mempɛ sɛ mihu wɔn ho hwee.
However, this is not the case.	Nanso, eyi nte saa.
So think about that.	Enti susuw saa asɛm no ho.
These kids are happy.	Saa mmofra yi wɔ anigye.
There are obviously factors involved.	Ɛda adi sɛ nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛwɔ mu.
He told me that	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ .
I would like to add that everything works fine.	Mepɛ sɛ mede ka ho sɛ biribiara yɛ adwuma yiye.
I don’t even know what it is.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ mpo.
Maybe this year will be the same.	Ebia afe yi nso bɛyɛ saa ara.
That’s what our business is moving towards.	Ɛno ne nea yɛn adwuma no rekɔ anim.
Our house is older, but we love it.	Yɛn fie no akyɛ, nanso yɛn ani gye ho.
They are all different types.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ ahorow ahorow.
It was a pleasure to visit their home.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye sɛ mɛkɔ wɔn fie.
I never knew him well.	Ná minnim no yiye da.
It may not be good, but it’s there.	Ebia ɛnyɛ papa, nanso ɛwɔ hɔ.
This is nothing of the sort.	Eyi nyɛ hwee a ɛte saa.
It’s not something like that.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
Even water may not be needed.	Ebia nsu mpo ho nhia.
In the meantime right now.	Wɔ saa bere yi mu mprempren ara.
Not good so far.	Ɛnyɛ papa de besi nnɛ.
This was more successful than he could have expected.	Eyi dii yiye sen sɛnea anka obetumi ahwɛ kwan.
It wasn’t at all.	Ná ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
It's a' now.	Ɛyɛ a' seesei.
The time had come for a decision.	Ná bere a wɔde besi gyinae no adu.
I want you to think about it.	Mepɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
I hope you can have fun.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi agye w’ani.
In the past, we lived only on animals.	Bere bi a atwam no, mmoa nkutoo na na yɛde tra ase.
I thought it wasn’t.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛnte saa.
We are the only ones who use it.	Yɛn nkutoo na yɛde di dwuma.
We will do the best we can.	Yɛbɛyɛ nea eye sen biara a yebetumi.
So a very, very interesting story.	Enti asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye yiye, yiye.
If there is no good, there is no evil.	Sɛ papa biara nni hɔ a, bɔne biara nni hɔ.
Your hair feels nice and soft.	Wo ti nhwi te nka sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
It’s just an accident.	Ɛyɛ akwanhyia bi kɛkɛ.
It’s not an idea.	Ɛnyɛ adwene.
The same is true in another sense.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
Finally, hang up the phone.	Awiei koraa no, fa telefon no to hɔ.
You are the one that isn’t.	Wo ne nea ɛnyɛ saa.
I had an idea.	Ná mewɔ adwene bi.
It doesn’t matter at all.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia koraa.
This hit me again in the present moment.	Eyi bɔɔ me bio wɔ mprempren bere yi mu.
It was as if he wanted to eat me alive.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔpɛ sɛ odi me nkwa mu.
You work when you want to.	Woyɛ adwuma bere a wopɛ.
He did it too hard and too many times.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​den dodo na ɔyɛɛ no ​​mpɛn pii dodo.
The story is a lie.	Asɛm no yɛ atoro.
Make arrangements at.	Yɛ ho nhyehyɛe wɔ.
A lot of people are going to work these days.	Nnipa pii rekɔ adwuma nnansa yi.
He was warm.	Ɔyɛɛ hyew.
I know this is wrong.	Minim sɛ eyi yɛ mfomso.
Which is quite simple.	Nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
Even if he wanted to.	Sɛ na ɔpɛ mpo a.
Eat less, recycle more.	Di kakraa bi, san de nneɛma pii di dwuma bio.
It’s not like that anymore.	Ɛnte saa bio.
It seems too complicated.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den dodo.
There is little of the man's life in them.	Ɔbarima no nkwa kakraa bi na ɛwɔ wɔn mu.
It will be possible.	Ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
I want it to be amazing.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Do the same for them.	Yɛ saa ara ma wɔn.
But that wasn’t so bad.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ bɔne saa.
It’s definitely information, but it’s not from one mind to another.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ nsɛm, nanso ɛnyɛ adwene biako mu nkɔ foforo so.
You may be surprised.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ wo nwonwa.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
Not that he could.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na obetumi.
We are a little happy.	Yɛn ani gye kakraa bi.
Use what you have.	Fa nea wowɔ no di dwuma.
I just don’t know why a man would say that.	Minnim nea enti a ɔbarima bi bɛka saa kɛkɛ.
Whatever you do, get started.	Nea wobɛyɛ biara no, fi ase.
It was a short-term experience.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi.
Only one thing is certain.	Ade biako pɛ na ɛyɛ nokware.
She snuggled closer to him.	Ɔde ne ho bɔɔ ne mu bɛn no.
Just in my opinion.	Wɔ m’adwene mu ara kwa.
What does that have to do with anything.	Dɛn na ɛno ne biribiara wɔ yɛ.
No one lives here now.	Obiara nte ha mprempren.
This method is twofold.	Saa kwan yi yɛ abien.
Everything was in the most perfect order.	Ná biribiara wɔ nhyehyɛe a edi mũ sen biara mu.
No one saw what happened.	Obiara anhu asɛm a esii no.
There was no evil in the picture.	Ná bɔne nni mfonini no mu.
It is far too late.	Ɛyɛ nea aka akyi koraa.
Give yourself away.	Fa wo ho ma.
The first is that there are so few of them.	Nea edi kan ne sɛ wɔn mu kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
This may be the first.	Ebia eyi ne nea edi kan.
And we will do that.	Na yɛbɛyɛ saa.
Anyway, thank you.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, meda wo ase.
That’s a huge one.	Ɛno yɛ kɛse.
Why is this happening?	Dɛn nti na eyi rekɔ so?
But think about it.	Nanso susuw ho hwɛ.
She spends a lot of time doing her hair.	Ɔde bere pii yɛ ne ti nhwi.
It’s too much.	Ɛdɔɔso dodo.
So that was one kid.	Enti na ɛno yɛ abofra biako.
One evening someone else was sitting at his favorite table.	Da koro anwummere bi na obi foforo te pon a n’ani gye ho paa so.
I didn’t know where you were planning to go next.	Na minnim baabi a woreyɛ nhyehyɛe akɔ akyi.

This situation is very common.	Saa tebea yi abu so yiye.

He can get it on their terms.	Obetumi anya bi wɔ wɔn nsɛm so.

I feel like there is not enough information.	Mete nka sɛ nsɛm a ɛdɔɔso nni hɔ.

Maybe he had inside information.	Ebia na ɔwɔ nsɛm a ɛwɔ mu.
It was a beautiful day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ fɛ.
You can handle it.	Wubetumi adi ho dwuma.
He too had said that everything has a reason.	Ná ɔno nso aka sɛ biribiara wɔ nea enti a ɛte saa.
This was a complete power play.	Ná eyi yɛ tumi agoru a edi mũ.
I had food and water.	Ná mewɔ aduan ne nsu.

But we all knew it.	Nanso na yɛn nyinaa nim.

And so that was difficult.	Na enti na ɛno yɛ den.
I just want it.	Mepɛ no ara kwa.
No one is ever happy about here.	Obiara ani nnye ho da wɔ ha ho.
Use what you want and what you can get.	Fa nea wopɛ ne nea wubetumi anya biara di dwuma.
Probably too many.	Ebia pii dodo.
It’s just that.	Ɛyɛ kɛkɛ.
To the right mind it is like a prison.	Wɔ adwene pa fam no ɛte sɛ afiase.
But it’s still interesting.	Nanso ɛda so ara yɛ anigye.
I have to do that now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa mprempren.
I want to talk to his mother.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne ne maame kasa.
Be careful what you believe.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ nea wugye di no ho.

I was just a kid, nobody said anything to me.	Na meyɛ abofra kɛkɛ, obiara anka hwee ankyerɛ me.
Make a play.	Yɛ agoru bi.
That’s pretty much what it seems to be happening.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ne nea ɛte sɛ nea ɛrekɔ so.
There’s nothing like a good book.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ nhoma pa.
There was something about him that wasn’t right.	Na biribi wɔ ne ho a na ɛnsɛ.
Or start a business.	Anaasɛ fi adwuma bi ase.
That was the way it was.	Saa na na ɛte.
It’s really pretty common.	Ɛyɛ fɛ a abu so ankasa.
I just love the beauty of real food.	M’ani gye sɛnea aduan ankasa yɛ fɛ no ho ara kwa.
And.	Ne.
They seemed to be happy.	Ɛte sɛ nea na wɔn ani agye.
It’s not about prison.	Ɛnyɛ afiase ho asɛm.
He knew it well.	Ná onim yiye.
Previous studies	Adesua ahorow a atwam
I would have loved that result.	Anka m’ani begye saa aba no ho.
Maybe it’s too hard.	Ebia ɛyɛ den dodo.
There is nothing else here.	Biribi foforo biara nni ha.
I have been watching you for two years.	Mede mfe abien ahwɛ wo.
That can be a huge mistake.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ mfomso kɛse.
A wide variety of quality.	Nneɛma ahorow pii a ɛyɛ papa.
So, do your best to avoid getting into trouble.	Enti, yɛ nea wubetumi biara na ankɔ ɔhaw mu.
But pretty much anything goes now.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biribiara kɔ so mprempren.
It works for both of them.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ma wɔn baanu nyinaa.
The last years are not good for him.	Mfe a edi akyiri no nyɛ papa mma no.

He was never the same person again.	Ná ɔnyɛ onipa koro no ara bio da.
This may have been true.	Ebia na eyi yɛ nokware.
He wasn’t doing that.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa.
I don’t think he was.	Minsusuw sɛ na ɔte saa.
Not until the end of next week.	Ɛnyɛ dapɛn a edi hɔ no awiei.
This man wears a hat.	Saa ɔbarima yi hyɛ kyɛw.
I want him to feel the same way.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔno nso te nka saa.
Treat your children well.	Yɛ wo mma yiye.
I live very close to it.	Mete bɛn ho paa.
You just know them.	Wunim wɔn ara kwa.
You see the problem.	Wuhu ɔhaw no.
But that was great.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ kɛse.
Water, water and more water!	Nsu, nsu ne nsu pii!
It is full of horrors.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ hu ahyɛ mu ma.
However, this is of little importance.	Nanso, eyi ho nhia kakraa bi.
Be the person you want to remember years from now.	Yɛ onipa a wopɛ sɛ wokae no mfe pii akyi.
But it was in trouble.	Nanso na ɛwɔ ɔhaw mu.
I just can’t do that because of the accident.	Akwanhyia no nti na mintumi nyɛ saa ara.
His bed hit him.	Ne mpa no bɔɔ no.
He doesn’t seem to know much about the problem.	Ɛte sɛ nea onnim ɔhaw no ho nsɛm pii.
No one is out here.	Obiara nni ha akyi.
Definitely not good.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ papa.
There was nothing else.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
That was just a mistake.	Na ɛno yɛ mfomso ara kwa.
There is only one thing.	Ade biako pɛ a ɛwɔ hɔ.
So simple, it’s complicated.	Enti ɛyɛ mmerɛw, ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
Night comes.	Anadwo ba.
That’s just not the case here.	Ɛno ara ne sɛ ɛnte saa wɔ ha.
I've got my head down.	Mede me ti akɔ fam.
My head hurt.	Me ti yɛɛ me yaw.
He's really bad, you know.	Ɔyɛ bɔne ankasa, wunim.
They put it down.	Wɔde too fam.
That’s how we do it.	Saa na yɛyɛ.
The two feed off each other.	Wɔn baanu no di wɔn ho wɔn ho aduan.
The thing you want is there.	Ade a wopɛ no wɔ hɔ.
The details were vague.	Ná nsɛm no mu nsɛm no mu nna hɔ.
Here is the letter.	Krataa no ni.
They are a quality team, very strong.	Wɔyɛ kuw a ɛyɛ papa, a wɔn ho yɛ den yiye.
No one saw him.	Obiara anhu no.
He has a new job, a new career, and friends.	Ɔwɔ adwuma foforo, adwuma foforo, ne nnamfo.
So enjoy yourself.	Enti gye w’ani.
You know it’s the truth.	Wunim sɛ ɛyɛ nokware no.
Assume that it is.	Fa no sɛ ɛte saa.
A water pipeline.	Nsu a wɔde fa ɔkwan bi so.
Only one day out of every year are the two identical.	Da koro pɛ wɔ afe biara mu no, abien no yɛ pɛ.
They will enjoy their work.	Wɔn ani begye wɔn adwuma ho.
This was always the thing for me.	Ná eyi ne ade a ɛyɛ me de bere nyinaa.
That is not how animals live.	Ɛnyɛ saa na mmoa tra ase.
Obviously, do your best.	Ɛda adi sɛ, yɛ nea wubetumi biara.
You have to believe it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye di.
What simple, simple things.	Nneɛma a ɛnyɛ den, nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw bɛn ara ni.
He probably knew his wife better than anyone.	Ebia na onim ne yere yiye sen obiara.
You are a busy man.	Woyɛ ɔbarima a onni adagyew.
Some days are hard.	Nna bi wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ den.
You are in bed.	Wowɔ mpa so.
I actually saw it.	Mihuu no ankasa.
Nothing seemed so important now.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara ho nhia kɛse mprempren.
These pictures are really beautiful.	Saa mfonini ahorow yi yɛ fɛ ankasa.
It doesn’t seem like that long.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ bere tenten saa.
It is not the same today.	Ɛnte saa ara nnɛ.
In that way, she’s gorgeous.	Wɔ saa kwan no so no, ɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
He didn’t want me to tell you.	Na ɔmpɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo.
Check out the appearance, too.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛte no nso.
But he knew what he had to do.	Nanso na onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
She is very beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
It seemed a little too simple.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo kakra.
But more on that a little later.	Nanso ɛno ho nsɛm pii akyiri yi kakra.
He had enough of this.	Ná ɔwɔ eyi a ɛdɔɔso.
Even beautiful people can do terrible things.	Nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ mpo tumi yɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ hu.
But he wasn’t.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ saa.
He intends to focus on making films.	Ɔyɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔde n’adwene besi sini ahorow a ɔbɛyɛ so.
But it’s not pretty.	Nanso ɛnyɛ fɛ.
A month, maybe.	Ɔsram biako, ebia.
It was a beautiful room.	Ná ɛyɛ dan a ɛyɛ fɛ.
What are those things?	Dɛn ne saa nneɛma no?
The manufacturers had to come up with some new features.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ nneɛma no de nneɛma foforo bi ba.
This last little bit.	Saa kakra a etwa to yi.
I just get it.	Me nsa ka ara kwa.
You don’t like that.	W’ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
Maybe he shouldn’t be so hard.	Ebia ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no den saa.
Remove that and it will work.	Yi ɛno na ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
There is nothing else on it.	Biribi foforo biara nni so.
Maybe we would have been in the paper.	Ebia anka yɛwɔ krataa no mu.
It wasn’t easy, but he did it.	Ná ɛnyɛ mmerɛw, nanso ɔyɛɛ saa.
It was good.	Ná eye.
I don’t know how it is.	Minnim sɛnea ɛte saa.
I didn’t know what he was doing.	Ná minnim nea ɔreyɛ.
This is very popular with everyone.	Eyi yɛ nea obiara ani gye ho kɛse.
Thank you for doing a great job!.	Meda wo ase sɛ woayɛ adwuma kɛse!.
I just didn’t know.	Ná minnim kɛkɛ.
The first option is dangerous.	Ɔkwan a edi kan no yɛ nea asiane wom.
You do an awesome job.	Woyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ hu.
I don’t know if it’s true or not.	Minnim sɛ ɛyɛ nokware anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
You are truly beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ ampa.
There is no one who can do that.	Obiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ saa.
And you can get them.	Na wubetumi anya wɔn.
The child was an only child.	Ná abofra no yɛ abofra koro pɛ.
He seemed to be a completely different person now.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ onipa foforo koraa mprempren.
It was kind of weird, though.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ nwonwa bi.
I hope this can be of any help.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ eyi betumi aboa biara.
I do pretty good things most days.	Meyɛ nneɛma pa yiye nna dodow no ara.
And how much that affected him.	Na hwɛ sɛnea na ɛno ka no kɛse.
This is obviously costly.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi yɛ nea ɛho ka yɛ den.
This is only one part of the problem.	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw no fã biako pɛ.
The problem was the scarcity of water.	Ná ɔhaw no ne nsu a na ɛho yɛ na no.
Finally he had done it.	Awiei koraa no na wayɛ.
It’s wonderful every time.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa bere biara.
But he did, and it was.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ saa, na ɛte saa.
He will do it very well.	Ɔbɛyɛ no yiye paa.
This is not entirely true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
A much better way.	Ɔkwan a eye sen saa koraa.
Hopefully it will be bigger and better.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ kɛse na ayɛ papa.
Thank you in advance for any help you can give.	Di kan da ase wɔ mmoa biara a wubetumi de ama no ho.
This is harder than it sounds.	Eyi yɛ den sen sɛnea ɛte no.
Most of the latter.	Nea etwa to no mu dodow no ara.
There are two reasons for this.	Nneɛma abien nti na ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I understand that, though.	Nanso, mete saa asɛm no ase.
How would you describe the house?	Wobɛka ofie no ho asɛm dɛn?
However, everyone has an opinion.	Nanso, obiara wɔ adwene bi.
I don’t want to do it.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ.
A great job.	Adwuma kɛse bi.
So did his own.	Saa ara na ne de no nso.
Please raise your hand.	Mesrɛ wo, ma wo nsa so.
Inside it is the same as a man.	Wɔ mu no ɛyɛ ade koro no ara sɛ ɔbarima.
I want this not to be real.	Mepɛ sɛ eyi nyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
However, a problem remains.	Nanso, ɔhaw bi da so ara wɔ hɔ.
I just did it.	Meyɛɛ no ​​ara kwa.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Go back to work.	San kɔ adwuma.
The danger is real.	Asiane no yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Interventions are critical.	Nneɛma a wɔde wɔn ho gye mu no ho hia kɛse.
They looked after the children with great attention.	Wɔde adwene kɛse hwɛɛ mmofra no.
Neither view was perfect.	Ná adwene abien no mu biara nni hɔ a edi mũ.
We both win.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa di nkonim.
That’s the reason for it.	Ɛno ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
You don’t have to do anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ hwee.
He didn't want to go too far into the room.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔbɛkɔ dan no mu akɔ akyiri dodo.
Everyone has to put their name on it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara de ne din to so.
You insert your product.	Wode wo ade no hyɛ mu.
It would be much easier that way.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse saa kwan no so.
Nothing was easy.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Nothing they do should affect you at all.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ biribiara a wɔyɛ no ka wo koraa.
You can only do that so many times.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa mpɛn pii saa nkutoo.
And something else went wrong or weird.	Na biribi foforo nso anyɛ yiye anaasɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
But this was the truth.	Nanso na eyi ne nokware no.
I felt something strange.	Metee biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa nka.
I can’t take this.	Mintumi mfa eyi.
He knows why that is.	Onim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Most people go into it.	Nnipa dodow no ara kɔ mu.
The first part of the test is easy.	Sɔhwɛ no fã a edi kan no yɛ mmerɛw.
The last time anyone asked him that question.	Bere a etwa to a obi bisaa no saa asɛm no.
We have to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
Maybe a little too perfect.	Ebia wɔyɛ pɛ dodo kakra.
Watch a game and that kind of thing.	Hwɛ agoru bi ne ade a ɛte saa.
Lead the way.	Di anim.
It’s the same again.	Ɛte saa bio.
What a mistake this is.	Mfomso bɛn ara ni.
Certainly not the money.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ sika no.
There are	Hɔ a
This is difficult, and difficult.	Eyi yɛ den, na ɛyɛ den.
One foot.	Nan biako.
He wanted to have the ending already.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔwɔ awiei no dedaw.
Or mine, for that matter.	Anaasɛ me de no, ɛno nti.
There was more, more.	Ná pii wɔ hɔ, pii bio.
I am the only one who understands.	Me nkutoo na mete ase.
There seemed to be very little hand systems.	Ɛte sɛ nea na nsa nhyehyɛe kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Inside, everything is one big room.	Wɔ mu no, biribiara yɛ dan kɛse biako.
He became sexually active.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ nna mu.
But in the larger narrative this is not possible.	Nanso wɔ asɛm kɛse no mu no eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Many people also worry about the problem.	Nnipa pii nso haw ɔhaw no.
No one says go tomorrow.	Obiara nka sɛ kɔ ɔkyena.
I wonder if this book will work for me.	Misusuw sɛ ebia nhoma yi bɛyɛ adwuma ama me anaa.
Another girl comes to school in this situation.	Abeawa foforo bi ba sukuu mu wɔ tebea yi mu.
There were many things in the study.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ adesua no mu.
I understood the concept.	Metee adwene no ase.
Imagine yourself in that situation now.	Fa no sɛ wowɔ saa tebea no mu mprempren.
Water is essential for life.	Nsu ho hia ma nkwa.
I would have given him anything.	Anka mede biribiara bɛma no.
But something strange happened recently.	Nanso biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii nnansa yi ara.
And I still don’t get it.	Na meda so ara nnya bi.
The dress flowed across the floor.	Atade no sen faa fam hɔ.
But maybe it’s not as hard as it sounds.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ den sɛnea ɛte no.
You can have it if you want one.	Wubetumi anya bi sɛ wopɛ bi a.
Arrangements had to be made.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe ahorow.
He is completely committed.	Ɔde ne ho ama koraa.
This is a very old house.	Eyi yɛ ofie dedaw paa.
Time to get back home this time.	Bere a yɛde san baa fie saa bere yi.
But there are plenty of downsides, too.	Nanso nneɛma bɔne pii wɔ hɔ, nso.
Get him to the city car on time.	Fa no kɔ kurow no mu kar no mu wɔ bere ano.
I don't know where they may have taken him.	Minnim baabi a ebia wɔde no kɔɔ.
The lower face.	Anim a ɛwɔ fam no.
To tell you.	Sɛ mɛka akyerɛ wo.
There’s a lot of music here.	Nnwom pii wɔ ha.
And move somewhere else.	Na tu kɔ baabi foforo.
Just like everything else in her house.	Te sɛ biribiara a ɛwɔ ne fie no ara pɛ.
He didn’t like me.	Ná n’ani nnye me ho.
They are perfect, perfect.	Wɔyɛ pɛ, wɔyɛ pɛ.
And what a story it was.	Na hwɛ asɛm a na ɛyɛ.
He worked almost every day of the year.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɔyɛ adwuma da biara wɔ afe no mu.
His father may have known, but he was gone.	Ebia na ne papa nim, nanso na onni hɔ bio.
He didn’t want anything.	Ná ɔmpɛ biribiara.
Almost no one noticed.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara anhu.
Your plan is flawed.	Wo nhyehyɛe no yɛ nea mfomso wɔ ho.
If you do, it is not.	Sɛ woyɛ saa a, ɛnte saa.
He wanted to talk to his mother.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne ne maame kasa.
Most of this is just set time though.	Eyi mu dodow no ara yɛ bere a wɔde asi hɔ ara kwa de, nanso.
Even now animal opportunities.	Seesei mpo mmoa hokwan ahorow.
Two scenarios are possible.	Tebea ahorow abien betumi aba.
Just feel the music.	Te nnwom no nka kɛkɛ.
His name was also fake.	Ná ne din nso yɛ atoro.
I thought about that.	Misusuw saa asɛm no ho.
But it didn’t seem to work.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I didn’t have to hang out with them anymore.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ me ne wɔn bɔ bio.
In here in the.	Wɔ ha mu.
It’s not about those things.	Ɛnyɛ saa nneɛma no ho asɛm.
I just worked.	Meyɛɛ adwuma ara kwa.
He wanted to hear more, more about them.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte wɔn ho nsɛm pii, pii.
Many children will follow another dog.	Mmofra pii bedi ɔkraman foforo akyi.
Take a closer look.	Hwɛ no yiye.
Just the first few.	Kakraa bi a edi kan no ara kwa.
I just had no control over it.	Ná minni so tumi biara kɛkɛ.
While this is true, it is obviously wrong.	Bere a eyi yɛ nokware no, ɛda adi sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
My mind would just go.	Ná m’adwene bɛkɔ kɛkɛ.
There was no human thought of him at that time.	Ná onipa adwene biara nni ne ho wɔ saa bere no mu.
You can use it to verify something.	Wubetumi de ahwɛ sɛ biribi yɛ nokware anaa.
This is easier than it sounds.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw sen sɛnea ɛte no.
All in good time.	Ne nyinaa wɔ bere pa mu.
It was exciting, very exciting.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye, na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
After your children? 	Wo mma akyi?
for anything else! 	wɔ biribi foforo biara ho!
He obviously feels bad about this.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔte nka bɔne wɔ eyi ho.
I can go there.	Metumi akɔ hɔ.
You stay with them.	Wo ne wɔn tra.
I want to make sure that.	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ hu sɛ.
Here's the thing.	Ade no ni.
Rumors seemed to abound.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea nsɛm a wɔka no abu so.
That man is the one.	Saa ɔbarima no ne obi a ɔwɔ hɔ.
I slipped back outside.	Mede me ho san fii adi.
People are terrible.	Nkurɔfo yɛ hu.
Eat a lot of this, not that.	Di eyi pii, nni saa.
No further information was needed.	Ná nsɛm foforo ho nhia.
He always knew what to say.	Ná onim nea ɔbɛka bere nyinaa.
And .	Ne .
You have to get involved.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu.
Move the back of your head to the front of your head.	Fa wo ti akyi kɔ wo ti anim.
However, he did not know them.	Nanso, na onnim wɔn.
And it wasn’t him.	Na ɛnyɛ ɔno.
After all, it was still her month.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na ɛda so ara yɛ ne ɔsram.
This power is within us.	Saa tumi yi wɔ yɛn mu.
Knowing that he has to.	Nim a onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I’m so jealous.	M’ani bere paa.
Not much better.	Ɛnyɛ papa pii.
The important path remains.	Ɔkwan a ɛho hia no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
There were beautiful things here.	Ná nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ ha.
That surprised me.	Ɛno maa me ho dwiriw me.
There is no need to give someone away.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔde obi bɛma.
You know, these things are interesting.	Wunim, saa nneɛma yi yɛ anigye.
He had a message for you.	Ná ɔwɔ asɛm bi ma wo.
At least he knew where he was.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na onim baabi a ɔwɔ.
He lives nearby too.	Ɔte bɛn hɔ nso.
This is another day.	Eyi yɛ da foforo.
If you want to.	Sɛ wopɛ a.
This was nothing new as it sounds.	Ná eyi nyɛ ade foforo sɛnea ɛte no.
Mine didn’t do that.	Me de no anyɛ saa.
Maybe it was something else entirely.	Ebia na ɛyɛ biribi foforo koraa.
He stepped into the room.	Ɔde ne nan sii dan no mu.
To whom does this stare refer	Hena na saa ani a wɔde hwɛ ade yi kyerɛ
That is if they do.	Ɛno ne sɛ wɔyɛ saa a.
The clothes were very fashionable.	Ná ntade no yɛ nea aba so kɛse.
Everyone was looking at me.	Ná obiara de n’ani kyerɛ me.
He knows the way.	Onim ɔkwan no.
It’s the end of the month.	Ɛyɛ ɔsram no awiei.
Back then it was even more popular.	Saa bere no na nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse mpo.
It’s not good at all.	Ɛnyɛ papa koraa.
It's even interesting what was included there actually.	Ɛyɛ anigye mpo nea wɔde kaa ho wɔ hɔ ankasa.
He dropped most of them but put one in his hair.	Ɔde dodow no ara too fam nanso ɔde biako hyɛɛ ne ti nhwi mu.
There was nothing I could see.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a metumi ahu.
Similar information was not available in the literature.	Ná nsɛm a ɛte saa ara nni nhoma ahorow mu.
You have to do it	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ
I don't know why they included him in the film.	Minnim nea enti a wɔde no kaa sini no ho.
Or there used to be.	Anaasɛ kan no na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Work on the plan.	Yɛ nhyehyɛe no ho adwuma.
That was a very good night.	Ná ɛno yɛ anadwo pa ara.
We need to work on them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ wɔn ho adwuma.
He doesn’t always do it.	Ɔnyɛ no bere nyinaa.
I love the water.	M’ani gye nsu no ho.
Most were last year.	Ná dodow no ara ne afe a etwaam no.
It’s dangerous.	Ɛyɛ asiane.
I can’t sleep much now.	Mintumi nna pii mprempren.
But one thing was certain.	Nanso na ade biako yɛ nokware.
In almost every way.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔkwan biara so.
I kind of like him.	M’ani gye ne ho wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
I'm a little young about that.	Meyɛ abofra kakra wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
We can be successful.	Yebetumi ayɛ yiye.
It’s too fast.	Ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
The picture is beautiful.	Mfonini no yɛ fɛ yiye.
I want to go to him.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ ne nkyɛn.
Everyone else loved it.	Obiara a aka no ani gyee ho.
No one can do much for the first few days.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ pii nna kakraa a edi kan no.
But he doesn’t.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa.
Everything here is just amazing.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ ha no yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
There were few problems with the phone.	Ná ɔhaw kakraa bi na ɛwɔ telefon no ho.
Otherwise the pictures are great.	Anyɛ saa a mfonini ahorow no yɛ fɛ yiye.
You just can’t do that.	Worentumi nyɛ saa kɛkɛ.
Say what you have to say.	Ka nea ɛsɛ sɛ woka.
Something went wrong.	Biribi ankɔ yiye.
It was either him or us.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔno anaa yɛn.
A little too excited.	Anigye dodo kakra.
Only for years.	Mfe pii nkutoo.
He had to say something.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka biribi.
We exist to work on ourselves.	Yɛwɔ hɔ sɛ yɛbɛyɛ yɛn ho adwuma.
That is the situation here.	Saa na tebea no te wɔ ha.
She lives with her father.	Ɔne ne papa tra.
I would greatly appreciate any help.	M’ani begye kɛse wɔ mmoa biara ho.
Eating by the donor should not be a problem.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ nea ɔde mmoa ma no adi no yɛ ɔhaw.
The incident happened shortly after midnight.	Asɛm no sii wɔ anadwo fã akyi bere tiaa bi.
He was eccentric and he knew it.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ nwonwa na na onim.
In the same case.	Wɔ saa asɛm koro no ara mu.
But often it is not.	Nanso mpɛn pii no, ɛnte saa.
Any two people.	Nnipa baanu biara.
Fortunately, he didn’t know what to do.	Nea eye ne sɛ, na onnim nea ɔnyɛ.
Very dense for its size.	Ɛyɛ den yiye ma ne kɛse.
He seems like a nice guy.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It’s past time for a lot of things.	Ɛyɛ bere a atwam ma nneɛma pii.
I know you’ve done it right.	Minim sɛ woayɛ no yiye.
Is there anything you can do about that?	So biribi wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ wɔ saa asɛm no ho?
I need to be more careful.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye kɛse.
I want you to see my children.	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu me mma no.
And so it is so beautiful.	Na saa ara nso na ɛyɛ fɛ saa.
You say he is strong.	Woka sɛ ɔyɛ den.
Say thank you to him.	Ka sɛ meda no ase.
Get out of their way.	Fi wɔn kwan so.
In our view, the matter is less clear.	Wɔ yɛn adwene mu no, asɛm no mu nna hɔ kɛse.
All I had to do was do it.	Nea na ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ara ne sɛ meyɛ.
I wish he was here.	Me yam a anka ɔwɔ ha.
He wasn’t feeling well.	Ná ne ho nyɛ no den.
It’s just something that needs to be done.	Ɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ara kwa.
I think a lot of people can do that.	Misusuw sɛ nnipa pii betumi ayɛ saa.
Is this the best way?	So eyi ne ɔkwan a eye sen biara?
So it’s very true.	Enti ɛyɛ nokware paa.
This will be fast.	Eyi bɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
I don’t have to drive.	Ɛho nhia sɛ meka kar.
I didn’t want to do any of that.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara.
We can provide information, help.	Yebetumi de nsɛm ama, aboa.
They were doing it all by hand.	Ná wɔde wɔn nsa reyɛ ne nyinaa.
I wanted it to be really hard.	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den ankasa.
The point is that.	Asɛm no ne sɛ.
He could be two, three years old.	Obetumi ayɛ mfe abien, abiɛsa.
This is the one.	Eyi ne biako no.
Those days seem long gone at this point.	Ɛte sɛ nea saa nna no atwam akyɛ wɔ saa bere yi mu.
No one was busy.	Ná obiara nni adagyew.
The man let his hand fall to his side.	Ɔbarima no maa ne nsa hwee ne nkyɛn.
And the kids.	Ne mmofra no.
There is truth in this.	Nokware wɔ eyi mu.
The trend was down this year.	Ná nea ɛrekɔ so no akɔ fam afe yi.
But lots of fun.	Nanso anigye pii.
The problem is ourselves.	Ɔhaw no ne yɛn ho.
At least not on single issues.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nsɛm biako pɛ ho.
He wanted to be told what to do.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ wɔka nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ kyerɛ no.
Even if this idea exists, there is a bigger picture here.	Sɛ saa adwene yi mpo wɔ hɔ a, mfonini kɛse bi wɔ ha.
For most people that is also true.	Wɔ nnipa dodow no ara fam no ɛno nso yɛ nokware.
That was close.	Ná ɛno bɛn.
That would take up more space than here.	Ɛno begye baabi kɛse sen nea ɛwɔ ha no.
I think you are really on to something here.	Misusuw sɛ wowɔ biribi so ankasa wɔ ha.
The results have been good.	Nea afi mu aba no ayɛ papa.
I know everything about him.	Minim ne ho biribiara.
In a short period of time.	Wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
They are interesting to me.	Wɔyɛ anigye ma me.
In what follows, we will be interested in such quantities.	Wɔ nea edi hɔ no mu no, yɛn ani begye dodow a ɛte saa ho.
About a month ago, now.	Bɛyɛ ɔsram biako a atwam ni, mprempren.
The same day.	Da koro no ara.
This group was my favorite.	Saa kuw yi na m’ani gyee ho kɛse.
I didn’t know what it was.	Ná minnim nea ɛyɛ.
One era ends as the next begins.	Bere bi ba awiei bere a bere a edi hɔ no fi ase no.
He doesn’t want to look like that.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔte sɛ saa.
I absolutely do that.	Meyɛ saa koraa.
Everything comes with a reason.	Biribiara de nea enti a ɛte saa ba.
A time of danger.	Bere a asiane wom.
And it was very painful.	Na ɛyɛ yaw kɛse.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia.
If not, it’s not bad.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛnyɛ bɔne.
It’s an old saying, but it’s still true.	Ɛyɛ asɛm dedaw bi, nanso ɛda so ara yɛ nokware.
I want to know who did that.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu onii a ɔyɛɛ saa.
They obviously didn’t care.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm.
I really need to do that work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa adwuma no ankasa.
The story is right there.	Asɛm no wɔ hɔ ara.
Look at my eyes.	Hwɛ m’ani.
And that sounds like it absolutely should.	Na ɛno te sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ koraa.
And it just wasn’t mine.	Na ɛnyɛ me de ara kwa.
He would have liked that.	Anka n’ani begye saa asɛm no ho.
You can and will do it.	Wubetumi ayɛ na wobɛyɛ.
I could barely eat it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nni.
There will be more information.	Nsɛm pii bɛba.
Whatever it is.	Nea ɛyɛ biara.
He obviously likes it.	Ɛda adi sɛ n’ani gye ho.
That was the way it was.	Saa na na ɛte.
A long time ago.	Bere tenten a atwam.
Only his head was in the room.	Ne ti nkutoo na na ɛwɔ dan no mu.
This was a temporary one.	Ná eyi yɛ bere tiaa bi.
I'm sorry about it.	Mepa ho kyɛw.
I also love animals.	M’ani gye mmoa nso ho.
Use a soft object.	Fa ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw di dwuma.
That’s how a person is.	Saa na onipa te.
I know mine does.	Minim sɛ me de no yɛ saa.
Your way, boy.	Wo kwan so, abarimaa.
The music got faster as the music got faster.	Nnwom no yɛɛ ntɛmntɛm bere a nnwom no yɛɛ ntɛmntɛm no.
We need to do something about it now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi mprempren.
A few things that are put to good use.	Nneɛma kakraa bi a wɔde di dwuma yiye.
There may be little time.	Ebia bere kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Interesting news!	Asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye!
I feel terrible right now.	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ hu mprempren.
That’s really the issue here.	Ɛno ne asɛm a ɛwɔ ha ankasa.
There was nothing you could do about it.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
None of us did that.	Yɛn mu biara anyɛ saa.
I want you to be with me.	Mepɛ sɛ woka me ho.
But we shouldn’t be those people.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa nkurɔfo no.
The summer is here.	Awɔw bere adu.
I am well aware of that.	Minim saa asɛm no yiye.
In a short period of time.	Wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
It’s not for nothing.	Ɛnyɛ kwa.
However, that was always the case.	Nanso, na ɛte saa bere nyinaa.
So here was the thing.	Enti na ade no ni.
If you want to do that, fine.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ saa a, eye.
He had time to do so.	Ná ɔwɔ bere a ɔde bɛyɛ saa.
This might be scary.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ hu.
He was the only one in the house.	Ná ɔno nkutoo ne no wɔ fie hɔ.
However, there was one problem.	Nanso, na ɔhaw biako wɔ hɔ.
But this will always be the case.	Nanso eyi bɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
Often at the same time.	Mpɛn pii no, bere koro no ara mu.
You might say that.	Ebia wobɛka sɛ.
This method surprised me.	Ɔkwan yi yɛɛ me nwonwa.
Her headaches completely stopped after a month.	Ne ti a ɛyɛ no yaw no fii ase koraa wɔ ɔsram biako akyi.
His mother	Ne maame .
In my opinion, there are no good friends you can have.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no, nnamfo pa biara nni hɔ a wubetumi anya.
Nothing was ever good enough.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na eye da.
That didn’t seem to be a mistake.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛno nyɛ mfomso.
I have some money.	Mewɔ sika bi.
That’s how he thinks.	Saa na osusuw ho.
I never wanted children.	Ná mempɛ mmofra da.
There was no such man.	Ná ɔbarima a ɔte saa biara nni hɔ.
What matters is that books do you good.	Nea ɛho hia ne sɛ nhoma yɛ wo yiye.
That’s a whole other guy.	Ɛno yɛ ɔbarima foforo koraa.
More complete information if you’re interested.	Nsɛm pii a edi mũ sɛ w’ani gye ho a.
We hope for the best.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ nea eye sen biara bɛba.
Is that really what he is?	So saa na ɔte ankasa?
And remember, whatever you do, your children will do too.	Na kae sɛ biribiara a wobɛyɛ no wo mma nso bɛyɛ.
I thought it was a great idea.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ adwene kɛse.
I don’t want his money.	Mempɛ ne sika.
Loud and fast music.	Nnwom a ɛyɛ den na ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
I am here for the child.	Mewɔ ha ma abofra no.
Children can get it, which is a problem.	Mmofra betumi anya bi, na ɛno yɛ ɔhaw.
That last point makes a big point.	Saa asɛm a etwa to no ka asɛm kɛse bi.
Often.	Mpɛn pii.
Much, much of me.	Me ho pii, pii.
That is not his way.	Ɛno nyɛ ne kwan.
People will deal with everything.	Nkurɔfo bedi biribiara ho dwuma.
People have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nnipa yɛ saa.
But it wasn’t at all.	Nanso na ɛnte saa koraa.
I feel like a child.	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ abofra.
I was a squirrel.	Ná meyɛ ɔkraman.
And look there	Na hwɛ hɔ .
I’d love the same thing.	M’ani begye ade koro no ara ho.
You can help me a lot.	Wubetumi aboa me kɛse.
But look at my son.	Nanso hwɛ me ba no.
He liked her attitude.	N’ani gyee ne su no ho.
I look at him inside.	Mehwɛ no mu.
That has been a great learning process.	Ɛno ayɛ adesua nhyehyɛe kɛse.
I am a nothingness.	Meyɛ obi a hwee nni hɔ.
It must be a long time ago.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bere tenten a atwam.
The man with the first three names.	Ɔbarima a ɔwɔ din abiɛsa a edi kan no.
My head is starting to hurt.	Me ti afi ase reyɛ me yaw.
This is why we use it.	Eyi nti yɛde di dwuma.
It’s pretty amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
This was a wise move.	Ná eyi yɛ ade a nyansa wom.
But the problem was, there were people in the way.	Nanso na ɔhaw no ne sɛ, na nnipa wɔ kwan no so.
But you don’t seem even that interested.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea w’ani nnye ho saa mpo.
But he had no better idea.	Nanso na onni adwene biara a eye sen saa.
He must act quickly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ade ntɛm.
He says he would be more interested in work.	Ɔka sɛ anka n’ani begye adwuma ho kɛse.
He, or she, is also impulsive.	Ɔno, anaa ɔno nso yɛ obi a ɔyɛ ade ntɛmntɛm.
Close but not final.	Bɛn nanso ɛnyɛ nea etwa to.
You can put your head next to mine.	Wubetumi de wo ti ahyɛ me de no nkyɛn.
But someone already seems to be in his room.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea obi wɔ ne dan mu dedaw.
This can be a very scary thought.	Eyi betumi ayɛ adwene a ɛyɛ hu yiye.
No one knew anything.	Ná obiara nnim hwee.
I cycled out of town.	Mede sakre kɔɔ kurow no akyi.
And it wasn’t us.	Na ɛnyɛ yɛn na ɛte saa.
None of us should let that happen.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛn mu biara ma ɛno ba.
I wish you would do that.	Me yam a anka wobɛyɛ saa.
As long as he wants to.	Bere tenten a ɔpɛ no.
That is the whole truth.	Ɛno ne nokware no nyinaa.
This cannot continue.	Eyi ntumi nkɔ so.
That was really hard for me.	Ná ɛno yɛ den ma me ankasa.
I couldn’t feel anything.	Ná mintumi nte biribiara nka.
A little more complicated.	Kakra a ɛyɛ den kɛse.
And so is he, too.	Na saa ara na ɔno nso te.
In this room.	Wɔ saa dan yi mu.
The game should be almost over.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛkame ayɛ sɛ agoru no aba awiei.
Most people live there.	Nnipa dodow no ara te hɔ.
It wasn’t like this before.	Ná ɛnte sɛ eyi kan.
I love him and I’ve always loved him.	M’ani gye ne ho na m’ani gye ne ho da.
But that can’t be the case.	Nanso ɛno ntumi nyɛ saa.
This is a remarkable one.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa.
A number of people filled the room.	Nnipa dodow bi hyɛɛ dan no mu ma.
You find it very good.	Wuhu sɛ ɛyɛ papa yiye.
The two were actually one, after all.	Ná nneɛma abien no yɛ biako ankasa, ne nyinaa akyi no.
But that’s not good enough.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
It doesn’t surprise him.	Ɛnyɛ no nwonwa.
How you can achieve it.	Sɛnea wubetumi adu ho.
Add more water, if needed.	Fa nsu pii ka ho, sɛ ɛho hia a.
The quality of each quality.	Su a ɛwɔ su biara mu.
Don’t think about it, just act on it.	Nsusuw ho, yɛ ho biribi kɛkɛ.
I can go alone.	Me nkutoo metumi akɔ.
I knew myself.	Ná minim me.
He thought about it for a moment.	Osusuw ho bere tiaa bi.
That’s never been the case.	Ɛno na ɛte saa da.
If you want some shoes.	Sɛ wopɛ mpaboa bi a.
I see him almost every day.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mihu no da biara da.
It’s a human way.	Ɛyɛ onipa kwan.
She patted her dog on the head.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne kraman no ti so.
Or on his own.	Anaasɛ ne de so.
This is a true story.	Eyi yɛ nokware.
Not pretty, but not expensive.	Ɛnyɛ fɛ, nanso ne bo nyɛ den.
But it would have been fun.	Nanso anka ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
For someone else it may be none of those things.	Wɔ obi foforo fam no ebia ɛnyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara.

If he does that.	Ɔyɛ saa a.
At least not for him.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ ɔno de.
The water is now warm.	Mprempren nsu no ayɛ hyew.
I just hope you can forgive me.	Mewɔ anidaso ara sɛ wubetumi de akyɛ me.
Please help me.	Mesrɛ mmoa.
I would obviously agree with you.	Ɛda adi sɛ me ne wo bɛyɛ adwene.
They are the reason we have the opportunities we have today.	Wɔn ne nea enti a yɛwɔ hokwan ahorow a yɛwɔ nnɛ no.
The two officers shook hands.	Polisifo baanu no bɔɔ wɔn ho wɔn ho nsa.
People can be awesome.	Nnipa betumi ayɛ wɔn a wɔn ho yɛ hu.
Should it be hard on, use it.	Sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den wɔ, fa di dwuma.
I couldn’t see.	Ná mintumi nhu ade.
And they were at ease with him.	Na wɔn ho tɔɔ wɔn wɔ ne ho.
At least one thing has gone right.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ade biako akɔ yiye.
All but one are off the street now.	Wɔn nyinaa afi abɔnten so mprempren, gye biako pɛ.
At least part of the problem.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɔhaw no fã bi.
It was him again.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔno bio.
No one came for him.	Obiara amma amma no.
But he had friends.	Nanso na ɔwɔ nnamfo.
He could make it work.	Ná obetumi ama ayɛ yiye.
And we do that.	Na yɛyɛ saa.
And you know us.	Na wunim yɛn.
Immediately, he was intrigued.	Ntɛm ara, n’ani gyee ho.
He grew bigger and stronger.	Ɔyɛɛ kɛse na ne ho yɛɛ den.
A huge number of cars on the road.	Kar dodow kɛse bi a ɛwɔ kwan so.
None of them are there.	Wɔn mu biara nni hɔ.
But he’ll be happy.	Nanso n’ani begye ho.
Your support means a lot to me.	Mo mmoa no kyerɛ pii ma me.
Mom is with us.	Maame ka yɛn ho.
Don’t let the dog out.	Mma ɔkraman no mfi adi.
I can barely hear it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nte.
I agree with you and fully understand that they work.	Me ne wo yɛ adwene na mete ase yiye sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma.
Just trust us.	Fa wo ho to yɛn so kɛkɛ.
But in time, you can control it.	Nanso bere kɔ so no, wubetumi adi so.
It is absolutely dangerous .	Ɛyɛ asiane koraa .
He is here with us.	Ɔne yɛn wɔ ha.
A situation of that nature.	Tebea bi a ɛte saa.
He never really knew why.	Ná onnim nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa da.
I thought it might have been him.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia na ɛyɛ ɔno.
Most of the time, I was alone.	Mpɛn pii no, na me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ.
Almost no one else lives in this town now.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obi foforo biara nte kurow yi mu mprempren.
Show our friends.	Kyerɛ yɛn nnamfo.
He added the same.	Ɔde kaa ho.
They are truly simple and perfect.	Wɔyɛ mmerɛw na wɔyɛ pɛ ampa.
I say this for several reasons.	Nneɛma pii nti na meka eyi.
Everything is absolutely clear.	Biribiara mu da hɔ koraa.
And another animal.	Ne aboa foforo bi.
That’s the role it plays in those cases.	Ɛno ne dwuma a edi wɔ saa nsɛm no mu.
I didn’t think he would actually go.	Na minsusuw sɛ ɔbɛkɔ ankasa.
Surprisingly,	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa, .
Maybe the strange cold.	Ebia awɔw a ɛyɛ nwonwa no.
It didn’t have to be.	Ná enhia sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
It looks pretty cool.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Say you will do so.	Ka sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
It’s a pleasure for me.	Ɛyɛ anigye ma me.
It’s always somewhere.	Ɛwɔ baabi bere nyinaa.
I did a simple job.	Meyɛɛ adwuma bi a ɛnyɛ den.
The dog was very excited.	Ná ɔkraman no ani agye kɛse.
The first good one.	Nea edi kan a eye no.
He knows that.	Onim saa.
He has a plan for us, you know.	Ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe ma yɛn, wunim.
But it’s all hours of the day and night the same.	Nanso ɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew nyinaa awia ne anadwo saa ara.
I wanted to do that.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
Do whatever it takes to bring him back.	Yɛ nea ɛho hia biara na wode no aba.
Sleep is good.	Nna yɛ papa.
Nothing big, nothing big.	Biribi kɛse biara nni hɔ, biribi kɛse biara nni hɔ.
You know how he feels about that house and his mother.	Wunim sɛnea ɔte nka wɔ saa fie no ne ne maame ho.
Look at him!	Hwɛ no!
Here's mine.	Me de no ni.
He tries to do this whenever possible.	Ɔbɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛyɛ eyi bere biara a ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
However, I was good.	Nanso, na meyɛ papa.
It’s what they do.	Ɛyɛ nea wɔyɛ.
He wants the team.	Ɔpɛ kuw no.
However, he was a potential candidate.	Nanso, na ɔyɛ obi a obetumi ayɛ saa.
Everything is still there for that moment.	Biribiara da so ara wɔ hɔ ma saa bere no.
It seems pretty simple.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Not because it’s quick.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛm nti.
I really need to talk to him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa ankasa.
Except, he does.	Gye sɛ, ɔyɛ saa.
You have to give me something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode biribi ma me.
But music is very important.	Nanso nnwom ho hia paa.
We owe it to you.	Yɛde ka.
The same is true for you.	Saa ara na wubetumi ayɛ saa.
Method.	Ɔkwan.
This is certainly true.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
There are many people.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ.
It is mostly used by children.	Mmofra na wɔde di dwuma kɛse.
Don’t show me that thing.	Mfa saa ade no nkyerɛ me.
A trouble came into his eyes.	Ɔhaw bi baa n’ani so.
That project will end tomorrow afternoon.	Saa adwuma no bɛba awiei ɔkyena awia.
That’s what happened here.	Ɛno ne nea esii wɔ ha.
I used to be a girl who really liked her shoes.	Kan no na meyɛ abeawa a m’ani gye ne mpaboa ho ankasa.
They were just amazing.	Ná wɔyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
This will be exciting.	Eyi bɛyɛ anigye.
You can have the rest of the morning.	Wubetumi anya anɔpa no fã a aka no.
This group is awesome.	Saa kuw yi yɛ hu.
That is the story we were told.	Saa na asɛm a wɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn no te.
It was very cheap.	Ná ne bo yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
That concludes my speech.	Ɛno ne me kasa no awiei.
Thank you so much!	Meda wo ase pa ara!
Few bad days on the street.	Nna bɔne kakraa bi na wowɔ abɔnten so.
Mom uses it now and then.	Maame de di dwuma mprempren ne mprempren.
That is the whole point of both books.	Ɛno ne nhoma ahorow abien no mu asɛm nyinaa.
It’s not that they’re bad.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ wɔyɛ bɔne.
Finally, he was gone.	Awiei koraa no, na onni hɔ bio.
Everything and nothing.	Biribiara ne biribiara nni hɔ.
Let everyone know his name.	Ma obiara nhu ne din.
Everybody knows everybody.	Obiara nim obiara.
The mind controls everything.	Adwene no di biribiara so.
I think we can do a lot better.	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi ayɛ papa pii.
You were there, and so you were.	Na wowɔ hɔ, na saa ara na na wowɔ hɔ.
This was not surprising.	Ná eyi nyɛ nwonwa.
That was a surprise.	Ná ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
Sleep was in his eyes.	Ná nna ayɛ n’ani so.
I think both are true.	Misusuw sɛ abien no nyinaa yɛ nokware.
Otherwise, it still works relatively well.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛda so ara yɛ adwuma yiye kakra.
Things are complicated.	Nneɛma mu yɛ den.
But again, that will take time.	Nanso bio, ɛno begye bere.
And no one did anything about it.	Na obiara anyɛ ho hwee.
He used his powers for good.	Ɔde ne tumi ahorow dii dwuma maa papa.
Only a few are interested.	Kakraa bi pɛ na wɔn ani gye ho.
He glared at the big man.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ɔbarima kɛse no.
Things are not like that anymore.	Nneɛma nte saa bio.
Keep it up.	Fa kɔ so.
We can’t have it without you.	Yɛrentumi nnya bi a wo nka ho.
But everyone decided to keep going.	Nanso obiara sii gyinae sɛ ɔbɛkɔ so ayɛ saa.
We were in a very dangerous situation.	Ná yɛwɔ tebea a asiane wom paa mu.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
All of you.	Mo nyinaa.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
Or, maybe, ever.	Anaasɛ, ebia, da biara.
Good does triumph over evil.	Papa di bɔne so nkonim ampa.
Not before, and not now.	Ɛnyɛ kan, na ɛnyɛ mprempren nso.
If one is missing, be empty.	Sɛ biako nni hɔ a, yɛ nea hwee nni mu.
I have a plan for you and me.	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe bi ama me ne wo.
I have important things to do.	Mewɔ nneɛma a ɛho hia a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
Here is one simple thing you can do.	Ade biako a ɛyɛ mmerɛw a wubetumi ayɛ ni.
But this is obviously not possible.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
It’s your problem.	Ɛyɛ wo haw.
He touched the doorknob.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ɔpon no ano.
He does it every day.	Ɔyɛ no da biara da.
I can easily do this job.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ metumi ayɛ saa adwuma yi.
There are many species of animals.	Mmoa ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
You just knew it.	Ná wunim ara kwa.
He had no children.	Ná onni mma biara.
One cannot drive without a license.	Obi ntumi nka kar a onni tumi krataa.
The same problem lies here.	Ɔhaw koro no ara da ha.
The work is important but difficult.	Adwuma no ho hia nanso ɛyɛ den.
It’s a state of affairs.	Ɛyɛ tebea a ɛwɔ hɔ.
Those two don’t use the same strategy.	Saa baanu no mfa ɔkwan koro no ara nni dwuma.
However, this should not scare you.	Nanso, ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi bɔ wo hu.
This takes a lot more work than what has happened so far.	Eyi gye adwuma pii sen nea asi de besi nnɛ no.
There are two reasons for this.	Nneɛma abien nti na ɛte saa.
Probably the most intelligent man who ever lived.	Ebia ɔbarima a ɔwɔ nyansa sen biara a obiara traa ase.
Take the ground down.	Fa fam kɔ ​​fam.
Imagine my surprise.	Susuw sɛnea me ho dwiriw me no ho hwɛ.
There is a house	Ofie bi wɔ hɔ
This is not yet strong enough.	Eyi nnya nyɛɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ.
No one is too happy.	Obiara nni hɔ a n’ani gye dodo.
It was very dangerous.	Na asiane kɛse wom.
Maybe even a year.	Ebia afe biako mpo.
It was beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ.
It’s probably the case.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
Apparently I am included.	Ɛda adi sɛ me ka ho.
Plan and implement.	Yɛ nhyehyɛe na fa di dwuma.
There was no need to say any more.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ wɔka bio.
It’s very, very bad.	Ɛyɛ bɔne paa, paa.
Please put your hand here.	Mesrɛ wo, fa wo nsa to ha.
So that’s how things are going.	Enti saa na nneɛma rekɔ so.
The story is all anyone needs.	Asɛm no ne nea obiara hia nyinaa.
It was just beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa.
The chorus was for him to understand.	Ná nnwom a wɔde bɔ nnwom no yɛ nea ɔte ase.
I had to take risks.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede me ho to asiane mu.
Don’t feel it.	Mma wo nte nka.
I just couldn’t believe he could be so beautiful.	Na mintumi nnye nni kɛkɛ sɛ obetumi ayɛ fɛ saa.
That was a very good idea.	Ná ɛno yɛ adwene a eye paa.
Insert.	Fa hyɛ mu.
Take yourself here.	Fa wo ho kɔ ha.
Does he do that.	So ɔyɛ saa.
This was supposed to be easy.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ mmerɛw.
This was truly amazing.	Ná eyi yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
Take yourself through it.	Fa wo ho fa mu.
No further processing is required.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ ho adwuma bio.
This was no longer the case.	Ná eyi nyɛ saa bio.
Happiness is happiness.	Anigye yɛ anigye.
However, this is certainly not the only use.	Nanso, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ eyi nkutoo ne nea wɔde di dwuma.
And I was like.	Na mete sɛ.
He knew his father better than anyone.	Ná onim ne papa yiye sen obiara.
One needs to take good care of all of them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi hwɛ wɔn nyinaa yiye.
And we run with it.	Na yɛde tu mmirika.
He does nothing to help.	Ɔnyɛ biribiara mfa mmoa.
Not this time of year anyway.	Ɛnyɛ afe no mu bere yi mu ɔkwan biara so.
I think there must be a mistake.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mfomso bi wɔ hɔ.
He didn't know if he felt it.	Ná onnim sɛ ebia ɔte nka anaa.
In most cases.	Mpɛn pii no.
I know you never got it.	Minim sɛ mo nsa anka da.
So he took his dog with him.	Enti ɔde ne kraman no kaa ne ho.
This is really hard.	Eyi yɛ den ankasa.
I’m very fond of them.	M’ani gye wɔn ho paa.
However, there are some problems.	Nanso, ɔhaw ahorow bi wɔ hɔ.
Determine the job you want.	Hwɛ adwuma a wopɛ.
I don’t know him for sure.	Minnim no yiye.
That had to go away.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno kɔ.
I made a play.	Meyɛɛ agoru bi.
If possible, travel.	Sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye a, tu kwan.
I can’t believe they don’t like it more.	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ wɔn ani nnye ho kɛse.
And you will do the same.	Na wo nso wobɛyɛ saa.
Not when he brought us into this.	Ɛnyɛ bere a ɔno na ɔde yɛn baa eyi mu no.
But we can’t have that.	Nanso yɛrentumi nnya saa.
Only you can see it.	Wo nkutoo na wubetumi ahu.
It wasn’t perfect.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea edi mũ.
It may be both.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ abien no nyinaa.
Just go somewhere else.	Kɔ baabi foforo kɛkɛ.
Maybe you do that.	Ebia woyɛ saa.
Tell me what you want me to do.	Ka nea wopɛ sɛ meyɛ kyerɛ me.
They love their eloquence.	Wɔn ani gye wɔn asɛm a wɔka no yiye no ho.
I really, really hope so .	Mewɔ anidaso ankasa, ankasa, sɛ ɛte saa .
Many species are endangered.	Mmoa ahorow pii wɔ asiane mu.
You would have to hurry, but not too soon.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ntɛm, nanso ɛnyɛ ntɛm dodo.
We can all have it.	Yɛn nyinaa betumi anya bi.
It’s a test.	Ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ.
It should not include happiness.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ anigye ka ho.
Thus, the first claim follows.	Enti, asɛm a edi kan a wɔka no di akyi.
It seemed like a strange story to him.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ne fam.
But it doesn’t work for me.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma mma me.
Food was the only thing that mattered.	Ná aduan ne ade biako pɛ a ɛho hia sɛ wɔde di dwuma.
However, this attitude is not entirely true.	Nanso, saa su yi nyɛ nokware koraa.
See the next conclusion.	Hwɛ awiei asɛm a edi hɔ no.
So it was difficult.	Enti na ɛyɛ den.
The test was twofold.	Ná sɔhwɛ no yɛ nneɛma abien.
He could have controlled it on the spot.	Anka obetumi adi so wɔ hɔ ara.
I thought they would go alone.	Misusuwii sɛ wɔn nkutoo bɛkɔ.
Work on something.	Yɛ biribi ho adwuma.
No one is in control.	Obiara nni hɔ a odi so.
Great front, no windows.	Anim kɛse, mfɛnsere biara nni hɔ.
It is indeed our duty to do so.	Ɛyɛ yɛn ampa sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa.
The phone rings often today.	Telefon no taa bɔ nnɛ.
For mom she was very warm.	Wɔ maame fam no na ne ho yɛ hyew yiye.
But neither is life.	Nanso nkwa nso nyɛ saa.
Tonight at dinner.	Anadwo yi wɔ anwummere aduan ase.
I just love everything.	M’ani gye biribiara ho ara kwa.
However, I see that you	Nanso, mihu sɛ wo .
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
It was quite difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den koraa.
That's every one of you sitting in the front row.	Ɛno ne mo mu biara a ɔte anim fã no.
At least not for immediate use.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma ntɛm ara.
It’s really exciting.	Ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
But many don’t.	Nanso pii nyɛ saa.
Which, by the way, is about the same thing.	Nea, ɔkwan bi so no, ɛyɛ bɛyɛ ade koro no ara.
I am still the same man.	Meda so ara yɛ ɔbarima koro no ara.
He has been very successful.	Wayɛ obi a odi yiye paa.
He actually placed himself last.	Ɔde ne ho too nea etwa to ankasa.
I had never thought about it.	Ná minsusuw ho da.
You need to do this quickly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi ntɛm.
Something had taken their interest.	Ná biribi agye wɔn anigye.
That night, something strange happened.	Anadwo no, biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii.
I had little say in that.	Ná minni asɛm pii wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
And that’s what it is.	Na ɛno ne saa.
I hope you enjoy it.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye.
And finally things are getting there.	Na awiei koraa no nneɛma rekɔ hɔ.
It was also very impressive.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa nso yiye.
There was someone there.	Na obi wɔ hɔ.
So just like this one more time.	Enti eyi ara pɛ bere biako bio.
Not with him.	Ɛnyɛ ne nkyɛn.
I'm short on time anyway.	Meyɛ tiaa wɔ bere mu ɔkwan biara so.
So, you know, you're surprised.	Enti, wunim, wo ho ayɛ wo nwonwa.
He often forgets things.	Ne werɛ taa fi nneɛma.
Everything seems to be working fine.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara reyɛ adwuma yiye.
It was there before.	Ná ɛwɔ hɔ kan.
I love how happy he is.	M’ani gye sɛnea n’ani gye no ho.
The details were clear, for him and for everyone else.	Ná nsɛm no mu da hɔ, wɔ ɔno ne obiara fam.
He was involved in it.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
He had to talk to her.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne no kasa.
He was set up and taken down.	Wɔde no sii hɔ na wɔde no sii fam.
But even this has problems.	Nanso eyi mpo wɔ ɔhaw ahorow.
It was an easy task.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛnyɛ den.
He must have known her for quite some time.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na onim no bere tenten bi ni.
Or us, or.	Anaasɛ yɛn, anaasɛ.
But in most cases it is not.	Nanso wɔ nsɛm dodow no ara mu no, ɛnte saa.
Discover wonderful wonderful things.	Hu nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I think they work here though.	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma wɔ ha de, nanso.
The boy has enjoyed his favorite game.	Abarimaa no ani agye agoru a n’ani gye ho kɛse no ho.
He squinted at it.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ so.
All music is important.	Nnwom nyinaa ho hia.
I can’t believe any of that is true.	Me ntumi nnye nni sɛ ɛno mu biara yɛ nokware.
I didn’t really know him at the time.	Saa bere no na minnim no ankasa.
He was even nice to me.	Ná ɔyɛ me yiye mpo.
I wish him well.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ yiye.
People do things.	Nnipa yɛ nneɛma.
He wasn’t happy or excited.	Ná n’ani nnye anaasɛ n’ani nnye.
You can share information about yourself.	Wubetumi akyɛ wo ho nsɛm.
We have a lot of work to do.	Yɛwɔ adwuma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
Someone else does this for you.	Obi foforo nso yɛ eyi ma wo.
That’s the real idea.	Ɛno ne adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
She was in the house with her son.	Ná ɔne ne ba no wɔ fie hɔ.
Departure.	Rekɔ.
So they’re really the same thing.	Enti wɔyɛ ade koro ankasa.
It looked expensive and old.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne bo yɛ den na akyɛ.
Return the money back.	San fa sika no san kɔ.
It would have been much easier.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
He would do that.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ saa.
Not even a dog.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkraman mpo.
I have the opportunity to reach more people.	Mewɔ hokwan a mede bɛkɔ nnipa pii nkyɛn.
It’s not a new thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade foforo.
Don’t have it.	Nni no.
So it doesn’t work either.	Enti ɛnyɛ adwuma nso.
But the money just wasn’t there.	Nanso na sika a wɔde bɛyɛ saa no nni hɔ ara kwa.
In its length.	Wɔ ne tenten mu.
Every part of the book is really a story.	Nhoma no fã biara yɛ asɛm bi ankasa.
We need to get bigger, much bigger.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ kɛse, yɛyɛ kɛse kɛse.
These things were important.	Ná nneɛma yi ho hia.
It’s not the first time.	Ɛnyɛ nea edi kan.
I had to go there.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ.
That means he has no power.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ onni tumi.
A dog beats a dog.	Ɔkraman bi bɔ ɔkraman bi.
About half the time it works.	Bɛyɛ bere no fã na ɛyɛ adwuma.
As if there was a place for me here.	Te sɛ nea na baabi wɔ hɔ ma me wɔ ha.
But only later.	Nanso akyiri yi nkutoo.
He didn't know what to say to her.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛka akyerɛ no.
All faults are our own.	Mfomso nyinaa yɛ yɛn ankasa de.
People weren’t his thing.	Ná nkurɔfo nyɛ ne ade.
It’s a life.	Ɛyɛ nkwa.
He told her that he had something to tell her.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɔwɔ biribi a ɔbɛka akyerɛ no.
However, that didn’t work.	Nanso, ɛno anyɛ yiye.
That has been the case in the past.	Ɛte saa wɔ bere a atwam no mu.
I'll give it to you after this.	Mede bɛma wo wɔ eyi akyi.
I will bring him something else.	Mede biribi foforo bɛba ama no.
We’re both very excited about it.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa ani agye ho yiye.
We had to use the most important things.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde nneɛma a ɛho hia sen biara no di dwuma.
It’s a perfect song.	Ɛyɛ dwom a edi mũ.
As their children followed the same path.	Sɛnea wɔn mma faa ɔkwan koro no ara so no.
I was an old man.	Ná meyɛ ɔbarima dedaw bi.
We couldn’t have done that.	Anka yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
Start with	Fi ase de .
Every animal has a foot.	Aboa biara nan.
The car sped down the road.	Kar no de mmirika faa kwan no so.
He has no friends.	Onni nnamfo biara.
He didn't know why he had done this to himself.	Na onnim nea enti a wayɛ ne ho eyi.
But it was the best he could do.	Nanso na ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara a obetumi ayɛ.
Make it a habit to give people what you want to receive.	Fa su sɛ wode nea wopɛ sɛ wo nsa ka no bɛma nkurɔfo.
The materials used were very expensive.	Ná nneɛma a wɔde dii dwuma no bo yɛ den yiye.
He knew exactly where they were headed.	Ná onim baabi a wɔde wɔn ani kyerɛ no yiye.
However, it is not the same sin.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ bɔne koro no ara.
There is no such problem.	Ɔhaw a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ.
My shoes for work.	Me mpaboa a mede yɛ adwuma.
He had no room for anyone else.	Ná onni baabi mma obi foforo biara.
I also don’t know if I’m doing it right.	Minnim nso sɛ meyɛ no yiye anaa.
Or better yet, take it with you anyway.	Anaasɛ nea eye sen saa no, fa ka wo ho ɔkwan biara so.
The police followed suit.	Polisifo no dii akyi.
For many reasons.	Nneɛma pii ho.
He had no more language in him today.	Ná onni kasa biara bio wɔ ne mu nnɛ.
I don't really know about it.	Minnim ho hwee ankasa.
I knew it would be empty.	Ná minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nea hwee nni mu.
He was bad, not me.	Ná ɔyɛ bɔne, ɛnyɛ me.
And it’s not that bad either.	Na ɛnyɛ bɔne kɛse nso saa.
It should just be fun.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye ara kwa.
Except their water went bad.	Gye sɛ wɔn nsu no kɔɔ bɔne.
But we’re just good friends.	Nanso yɛyɛ nnamfo pa ara kwa.
Or so it seems.	Anaasɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
Everyone brings it.	Obiara de ba.
The point is, nothing is certain right now.	Asɛm no ne sɛ, biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nokware mprempren.
Everyone else is gone, except me.	Obiara a aka no nni hɔ bio, gye me nkutoo.
The boy shrugged his shoulders.	Abarimaa no de ne nsa kyerɛɛ ne ti so.
That was almost two years ago.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛte saa mfe abien a atwam ni.
What kind of person.	Onipa bɛn.
I was the only one who could help me.	Me nkutoo na na metumi aboa me.
At the time I didn’t know.	Saa bere no na minnim.
The work is best done by hand.	Wɔde nsa na ɛyɛ adwuma no yiye.
He told us it was so good to be home.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ na eye paa sɛ yɛwɔ fie.
But this takes time.	Nanso eyi gye bere.
That is the right way.	Ɛno ne ɔkwan pa no.
This is what he does.	Eyi ne nea ɔyɛ.
I can see it again.	Metumi ahu bio.
Nothing goes well tonight.	Biribiara nkɔ yiye anadwo yi.
He didn't know what to do with it.	Ná onnim nea ɔde bɛyɛ.
I am a monster.	Meyɛ aboa kɛse.
But this was not always possible.	Nanso na eyi nyɛ yiye bere nyinaa.
In its first week.	Wɔ ne dapɛn a edi kan no mu.
You can’t follow them.	Worentumi nni wɔn akyi.
It’s been happening for some time.	Ɛrekɔ so wɔ bere bi mu.
I heard that story.	Metee saa asɛm no.
And, it doesn’t need any power.	Na, enhia tumi biara.
I can still see each of their faces.	Meda so ara tumi hu wɔn mu biara anim.
This man owes it.	Ɔbarima yi de ka.
We make it our own.	Yɛyɛ no yɛn ankasa de.
But that would have been a whole other book, so who knows.	Nanso anka ɛno bɛyɛ nhoma foforo koraa, enti hena na onim.
I wanted to tell you something.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka biribi kyerɛ wo.
Thank you so much for that.	Meda wo ase pii wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
It’s too early.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo.
What is the time?	Bere no ne dɛn?
It wasn’t about money.	Na ɛnyɛ sika ho asɛm.
He is doing very well.	Ɔreyɛ yiye paa.
I never wanted to look this good.	Ná mempɛ sɛ me ho yɛ fɛ saa da.
I know it’s not.	Minim sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
That’s about as much as anyone can get out of him.	Ɛno bɛyɛ sɛ nea obiara betumi anya afi ne mu no.
Maybe two or three years.	Ebia mfe abien anaa abiɛsa.
I completely understood.	Metee ase koraa.
There is no one else.	Obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
This had to end here.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ eyi ba awiei wɔ ha.
As you wish.	Sɛnea wopɛ.
I wish you happiness and seem happy here.	Mepɛ sɛ w’ani gye na ɛte sɛ nea w’ani gye wɔ ha.
It will be good for you.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa ama wo.
You are not like a dog.	Wonyɛ sɛ ɔkraman.
I look forward to getting into it.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ mɛkɔ mu.
Tell me that.	Ka kyerɛ me sɛ.
Not on the shoes.	Ɛnyɛ mpaboa no so.
I’m not so sure what happened.	M’ani nnye nea esii no ho kɛse.
Happy, very happy.	Anigye, anigye kɛse.
I have two of them.	Mewɔ wɔn mu abien.
He is not just normal.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ɔte ase kɛkɛ.
I did the words.	Me na meyɛɛ nsɛm no.
They had to do it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I want to do all the things people do.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nneɛma a nkurɔfo yɛ nyinaa.
It was full of money.	Ná sika ahyɛ mu ma.
I know you believe in me.	Minim sɛ wugye me di.
At least a little, but often quite a lot.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, kakra, nanso mpɛn pii no ɛdɔɔso koraa.
There is nothing but this.	Biribiara nni hɔ gye eyi.
There are so many things to do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
Forget the whole thing.	Wo werɛ mfi ade no nyinaa.
He is in you.	Ɔwɔ wo mu.
You can’t help anyone.	Worentumi mmoa obiara.
His mind was simple.	Ná n’adwene yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I'm a little hot right now.	Me ho ayɛ hyew kakra mprempren.
He would do anything for me.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ biribiara ama me.
Everyone wants that.	Obiara pɛ saa.
Good power, that.	Tumi pa, ɛno.
In this work.	Wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
I have a headache.	Mewɔ ti a ɛyɛ me yaw.
Can you hand me this?	So wubetumi de eyi ama me nsa?
There is plenty of time.	Bere pii wɔ hɔ.
It was the same as before.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea na ɛwɔ hɔ kan no ara pɛ.
I’m interested in a lot of things.	M’ani gye nneɛma pii ho.
About the same as back home.	Bɛyɛ sɛnea ɛte wɔ fie akyi no ara pɛ.
We’ll all go.	Yɛn nyinaa bɛkɔ.
Here was a man.	Ná ɔbarima bi ni.
And he doesn’t.	Na ɔnyɛ saa.
But it wasn’t hard.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ den.
But there was a problem.	Nanso na ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
But that is obviously complicated.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ ɛno yɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
This was really happening.	Ná eyi rekɔ so ankasa.
That’s the reason we do it.	Ɛno ne nea enti a yɛyɛ saa.
Get your stuff and get out of my house.	Gye wo nneɛma na fi me fie.
Each of them has the same amount of money under the investment.	Wɔn mu biara wɔ sika a ɛwɔ sika a wɔde ahyɛ mu ase no yɛ kɛse saa ara.
I can walk.	Metumi nantew.
This was a first.	Ná eyi yɛ nea edi kan.
Everyone should try to do their best.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara bɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛyɛ nea obetumi biara.
But maybe not for everyone.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ obiara de.
He gets along very well with us here.	Ɔne yɛn di yiye paa wɔ ha.
He wasn’t there at the time.	Saa bere no na onni hɔ.
We have the whole day.	Yɛwɔ da mũ no nyinaa.
You can enter it here.	Wubetumi akɔ mu wɔ ha.
It’s not your problem.	Ɛnyɛ wo haw no.
What are you doing tonight?	Dɛn na woreyɛ anadwo yi?
Each one really brings some power.	Wɔn mu biara de tumi bi ba ankasa.
He didn't really want to talk about it.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka ho asɛm ankasa.
He was always a man of order.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe bere nyinaa.
Of what we have and how lucky we are to have it.	Nea yɛwɔ ne sɛnea yɛwɔ anigye sɛ yɛwɔ no ho.
Here are a few of our favorites.	Yɛn ani gye ho no mu kakraa bi ni.
This new approach is amazing!	Ɔkwan foforo yi yɛ nwonwa!
On the subject of the.	Wɔ asɛm no ho.
However, this approach had drawbacks.	Nanso, na saa kwan yi wɔ ɔhaw ahorow.
In this case it was a good thing.	Wɔ eyi mu no na ɛyɛ ade pa.
That was not what he was supposed to do.	Ná ɛnyɛ saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
Work is work, and money is money.	Adwuma yɛ adwuma, na sika yɛ sika.
Both are used.	Wɔde abien no nyinaa di dwuma.
But something important is happening here.	Nanso biribi a ɛho hia rekɔ so wɔ ha.
I still chase with him from time to time.	Meda so ara ne no taa akyi bere ne bere mu.
I am not alone.	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ.
This will loosen the hair a bit.	Eyi bɛma nhwi no ayɛ mmerɛw kakra.
I wanted to talk to you.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa.
Not that you have to do it every day.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no da biara da.
It wasn’t really a big deal.	Ná ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse ankasa.
You know what they do.	Wunim nea wɔyɛ.
That’s exactly the information you used.	Ɛno ara ne nsɛm a wode dii dwuma no.
He wasn't there this time.	Ná onni hɔ saa bere yi.
So, you are correct that it is wrong in this case.	Enti, woayɛ no yiye sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso wɔ asɛm yi mu.
I need to be down there.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ fam hɔ.
It’s one of those things.	Ɛyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biako.
That must have been the case.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛte saa.
The film is beautiful in its sexual details.	Sini no yɛ fɛ wɔ ne nna ho nsɛm mu kɔ akyiri.
I need to work on those more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa nneɛma no ho adwuma kɛse.
And yet you would be in a position to it you know.	Na nanso anka wowɔ tebea mu sɛ ɛyɛ wo nim.
Maybe he didn’t know that either.	Ebia na ɔno nso nnim saa.
He needs to spend more time running.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde bere pii tu mmirika.
The language was too loud.	Ná kasa no mu yɛ den dodo.
The house was beautiful.	Ná ofie no yɛ fɛ yiye.
Please, remember.	Mesrɛ wo, kae.
I always have a business with me.	Me ne me wɔ adwuma bi bere nyinaa.
But it will be so.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ saa.
It works in this way.	Ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ saa kwan yi so.
He speaks many languages.	Ɔka kasa ahorow pii.
He wanted to use her.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde no di dwuma.
There were many things.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ.
What have you done.	Dɛn na woayɛ.
I wish it was me.	Me yam a anka ɛyɛ me.
I know it’s not easy for any of you.	Minim sɛ ɛnyɛ mmerɛw mma mo mu biara.
He lives among them now.	Ɔte wɔn mu seesei.
So timing is not really my thing.	Enti bere a wɔde yɛ adwuma no nyɛ me ade ankasa.
Or at least to be comfortable with it.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wo ho bɛtɔ wo wɔ ho.
I don’t want that.	Mempɛ saa.
Not me, everyone wanted me to be.	Ɛnyɛ me no, na obiara pɛ sɛ meyɛ.
That went well, but after that, not so well.	Ɛno kɔɔ so yiye, nanso ɛno akyi no, ɛnyɛ papa saa.
I see a water buffalo.	Mihu nsu mu ɔkraman bi.
Maybe there was hope yet.	Ebia na anidaso wɔ hɔ de besi nnɛ.
That is if you want it.	Ɛno ne sɛ wopɛ no a.
Or think you do.	Anaasɛ susuw sɛ woyɛ saa.
Or on the surface.	Anaasɛ wɔ so.
I just want you to be on time with us, please.	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne yɛn di bere so kɛkɛ, mesrɛ wo.
She just had to trust him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho to no so ara kwa.
The race cars are of a road type, not the street.	Kar ahorow a wɔde tu mmirika no yɛ ɔkwan bi so de, na ɛnyɛ abɔnten so.
I’m a little bit interested.	M’ani gye ho kakra.
To an object.	De kɔ ade bi so.
Water is very soft.	Nsu yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
I could totally relate.	Ná metumi aka ho asɛm koraa.
It’s too soon though.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo nanso.
I’m very excited about this.	M’ani agye eyi ho kɛse.
But not really powerful.	Nanso ɛnyɛ obi a ɔwɔ tumi ankasa.
He was very fond of her.	Ná n’ani gye ne ho pii.
And it was just that, too.	Na na ɛte saa ara, nso.
It was his home, after all.	Ná ɛyɛ ne fie, ne nyinaa akyi no.
It wasn’t at all.	Ná ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
That was nothing new now.	Ná ɛno nyɛ ade foforo mprempren.
It was week to week.	Ná ɛyɛ dapɛn dapɛn.
It was a terrible night.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo a ɛyɛ hu yiye.
I want to do mine.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ me de no.
It had passed so quickly.	Ná atwam ntɛmntɛm saa.
I really like them.	M’ani gye wɔn ho ankasa.
There’s a lot going on.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛrekɔ so.
He had a severe headache.	Ná ne ti ayɛ no yaw kɛse.
It’s much better.	Ɛyɛ papa kɛse.
Is that really all you have to say?	So ɛno nkutoo na ɛsɛ sɛ woka ankasa?
I understand the risk of any one game.	Mete asiane a ɛwɔ agoru biako biara mu no ase.
And that’s them.	Na ɛno ne wɔn.
It is the first time he has used his first name.	Ɛno ne bere a edi kan a ɔde ne din a edi kan no adi dwuma.
I put her down, and she leaned against me.	Mede no too fam, na ɔde ne ho too me so.
The night was cold.	Ná awɔw wom anadwo no.
Maybe the girl can do that.	Ebia abeawa no betumi ayɛ saa.
Maybe it’s the case.	Ebia ɛte saa.
What they do.	Nea wɔyɛ.
Such a good book.	Nhoma pa a ɛte saa.
In the same year.	Wɔ afe koro no ara mu.
He had put it in for another.	Ná ɔde ahyɛ mu ama foforo.
I need to know why it is happening.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea enti a ɛrekɔ so no.
Or he should have.	Anaasɛ anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I want that for you.	Mepɛ saa ma wo.
This can’t be realistic.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
You can go now, if you want.	Wubetumi akɔ mprempren, sɛ wopɛ a.
So, assume it isn’t.	Enti, fa no sɛ ɛnte saa.
I know what this looks like, though.	Minim sɛnea eyi te, nanso.
It’s not like that.	Ɛnyɛ saa.
There was no road.	Ná ɔkwan no so nni hɔ.
Everyone knew this.	Na obiara nim eyi.
It’s not great at all.	Ɛnyɛ kɛse koraa.
Everything checked out.	Biribiara hwɛɛ mu.
And the comments he made about your mother.	Na nsɛm a ɔka faa wo maame ho no nso.
I don’t know anything else.	Minnim biribi foforo biara.
I was in school on a scholarship.	Ná mewɔ sukuu mu wɔ sika a wɔde ma me ho.
And put them in dress shirts.	Na fa wɔn hyɛ ntade a wɔde hyɛ ntade mu.
It was a full day at the time.	Saa bere no na ɛyɛ da mũ nyinaa.
I told you, it’s a thing.	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ, ɛyɛ ade.
I know how to do that.	Minim sɛnea mɛyɛ saa.
But it may not be.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
He touched hers.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne de no so.
The cold was intense.	Ná awɔw no mu yɛ den yiye.
Do one thing at a time.	Yɛ ade biako biara.
However, there are problems with this approach.	Nanso, ɔhaw ahorow wɔ saa kwan yi ho.
Thus, the latter is the ‘difficult’ case.	Enti, nea etwa to no ne asɛm a ‘ɛyɛ den’ no.
I just wanted to thank you.	Na mepɛ sɛ meda wo ase kɛkɛ.
Take tomorrow, too.	Fa ɔkyena nso.
It’s a big deal.	Ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse.
A very pretty girl.	Abeawa bi a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Try as you might, you will never succeed.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛnea wubetumi biara no, worentumi nni nkonim da.
If there is no doubt but again.	Sɛ akyinnye biara nni ho nanso bio.
I know what you want.	Minim nea wopɛ.
Every day, the real numbers are there.	Da biara no, dodow ankasa no wɔ hɔ.
They did so only at night.	Ná wɔyɛ saa anadwo nkutoo.
Their clothes are extremely casual.	Wɔn ntade no yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
I hope the best for everyone.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ nea eye sen biara bɛba ama obiara.
This is certainly true enough.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ nokware sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Signed with his own hand.	Ɔno ankasa nsa na ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ ase.
The situation is tense.	Tebea no mu yɛ den.
You can use whatever ingredients you want.	Wubetumi de nneɛma biara a wopɛ adi dwuma.
I don't think you will, though.	Nanso, minsusuw sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
I was too young to be a dog.	Ná meyɛ abofra dodo sɛ mɛyɛ ɔkraman.
But for me, those studies completely miss the point.	Nanso wɔ me fam no, saa adesua ahorow no pa asɛm no koraa.
The thing itself.	Ade no ankasa.
As well as he should.	Sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no yiye no.
It’s going well.	Ɛrekɔ so yiye.
My clothes don’t fit.	Me ntade ntumi nkɔ.
Give your time.	Fa wo bere ma.
They both knew that.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa nim saa.
None of this is wrong.	Eyi mu biara nyɛ mfomso.
This is something that has been in the works for a while.	Eyi yɛ biribi a ɛwɔ adwuma mu bere tiaa bi.
The bottom line was the one he had used.	Asɛm a ɛwɔ fam no ne nea na ɔde adi dwuma no.
He is both human and non-human.	Ɔyɛ onipa na ɔnyɛ onipa nso.
I don’t really understand what happened.	Me ntumi nte nea esii no ase ankasa.
I seemed too young.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea meyɛ abofra dodo.
That was a little difficult.	Ná ɛno yɛ den kakra.
Maybe that was his idea.	Ebia na ɛno ne n’adwene.
That even goes into the music industry as well.	Ɛno mpo kɔ nnwom adwuma no mu nso.
And yet, she never had a man.	Na nanso, na onni ɔbarima biara da.
And he had friends.	Na na ɔwɔ nnamfo.
But it was also incredibly simple.	Nanso na ɛyɛ mmerɛw a ɛyɛ nwonwa nso.
It might actually work.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ adwuma ankasa.
He knows something is going on.	Onim sɛ biribi rekɔ so.
Take him to my room.	Fa no kɔ me dan mu.
I don’t know how to do it.	Minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ.
Maybe it should have been.	Ebia na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
Everything you have, you have.	Biribiara a wowɔ no, wowɔ.
I don’t want this.	Mempɛ eyi.
However, it’s no big deal.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse biara.
All at the same time.	Ne nyinaa bere koro mu.
The only food for thought.	Aduan biako pɛ ne nea wɔde susuw nneɛma ho.
I knew that was you.	Ná minim sɛ ɛno ne wo.
But it was well past midnight.	Nanso na aka anadwo fã koraa.
It has made them very happy.	Ama wɔn ani agye paa.
He was excited.	Ná n’ani gye.
Eventually, it will.	Awiei koraa no, ɛbɛyɛ saa.
He slipped his hands together.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ mu.
Knowing, in the end, everything he wasn’t doing for you.	Nim, awiei koraa no, biribiara a na ɔnyɛ ma wo.
You could get everything there.	Ná wubetumi anya biribiara wɔ hɔ.
It is now extremely rare .	Mprempren ɛho yɛ na koraa .
Neither did his father.	Saa ara na ne papa nso anyɛ saa.
Never allow it.	Mma no kwan da.
And that’s how it was.	Na saa na na ɛte.
But the story was completely untrue.	Nanso na asɛm no nyɛ nokware koraa.
However, it was too bad.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ bɔne dodo.
It seems more like that.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa kɛse.
He is too strong.	Ɔyɛ den dodo.
But, that’s all.	Nanso, ɛno nkutoo.
Tomorrow, have fun.	Ɔkyena, momma mo ani nnye.
You have to think about it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
I’d love to hang out with you.	M’ani begye ho sɛ me ne wo bɛbɔ.
It feels really awesome.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ hu ankasa.
The project was very successful.	Adwuma no dii yiye paa.
He had a really good sense of wonder.	Ná ɔwɔ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa ho anigye pa ankasa.
There is more good in you than anything else.	Nneɛma pa pii wɔ wo mu sen biribi foforo biara.
This completely surprised him.	Eyi maa ne ho dwiriw no koraa.
You can give it to him easily.	Wubetumi de ama no a ɛnyɛ den.
Which is not the point of this at all.	Nea ɛnyɛ asɛm a ɛwɔ eyi mu koraa.
You think you know what you want.	Wususuw sɛ wunim nea wopɛ.
But this is nothing new to them.	Nanso eyi nyɛ ade foforo mma wɔn.
Just using people.	Nnipa a wɔde bedi dwuma ara kwa.
They are happy.	Wɔn ani gye.
It also looks good.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ papa nso.
You are in control in this situation.	Wo na wowɔ tumi wɔ saa tebea yi mu.
I know what it is, but that doesn’t matter.	Minim nea ɛyɛ, nanso ɛno mfa ho.
That was my first home.	Ɛno ne me fie a edi kan.
I just don’t do that.	Menyɛ saa kɛkɛ.
I have a lot of risk here.	Mewɔ asiane pii wɔ ha.
He wanted his words to be true.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ne nsɛm no yɛ nokware.
I knew what was going on.	Ná minim nea ɛrekɔ so.
But that doesn’t work.	Nanso ɛno ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
This was a surprise.	Ná eyi yɛ nwonwa.
I didn’t know anything.	Ná minnim hwee.
In the house.	Wɔ fie hɔ.
It was a very cold day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a awɔw wom paa.
They are very good and very well done.	Wɔyɛ papa paa na wɔyɛ no yiye paa.
He speaks two languages.	Ɔka kasa abien.
It’s hard for everyone, probably.	Ɛyɛ den ma obiara, ebia.
I'm in pain.	Me ho yɛ me yaw.
I want to make a couple of points.	Mepɛ sɛ meka nsɛm abien anaa abiɛsa.
Just like in the movies!	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ sini ahorow mu no ara pɛ!
It will rain again soon.	Nsu bɛtɔ bio nnansa yi ara.
Most people use their real names.	Nnipa dodow no ara de wɔn din ankasa na edi dwuma.
Everyone forgets.	Obiara werɛ fi.
It’s time for something completely different.	Ɛyɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribi foforo koraa.
But save them and he did.	Nanso gye wɔn nkwa na ɔyɛɛ saa.
Think about it if you want.	Susuw ho hwɛ sɛ wopɛ a.
The former is not.	Kan no nyɛ saa.
Do well in school today.	Yɛ yiye wɔ sukuu mu nnɛ.
I will only use it in one situation though.	Mede bedi dwuma wɔ tebea biako pɛ mu de, nanso.
You need to know what you can find there.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu nea wubetumi ahu wɔ hɔ.
But this method is less realistic than the first.	Nanso saa ɔkwan yi nyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware sen nea edi kan no.
To establish the	Sɛ wɔde besi hɔ .
But that’s pretty much your problem now.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ne wo haw mprempren.
The pictures are taken to the gallery.	Wɔde mfonini ahorow no kɔ baabi a wɔde nneɛma kyerɛ no.
You will do what you said.	Wobɛyɛ nea wokae no.
The test isn’t easy though.	Sɔhwɛ no nyɛ mmerɛw de, nanso.
Keep up the good work, man.	Kɔ so yɛ adwuma pa, onipa.
I’ve never liked him.	M’ani nnye ne ho da.
But this is not the only danger.	Nanso ɛnyɛ eyi nkutoo ne asiane no.
That makes a point.	Ɛno ma asɛm bi da adi.
I'm in the living room, in bed.	Mewɔ dan mu, wɔ mpa so.
But just think about that.	Nanso susuw saa asɛm no ho kɛkɛ.
You need to consider both of these factors.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw saa nneɛma abien yi nyinaa ho.
You have to make your way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wo kwan.
Nowadays, there is a lot of traffic in the city.	Mprempren, kar pii fa kurow no mu.
But that doesn’t seem to help.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛno mmoa.
It’s just not pretty.	Ɛnyɛ fɛ kɛkɛ.
But we can deal with it.	Nanso yebetumi adi ho dwuma.
It is not true at all.	Ɛnyɛ nokware koraa.
So can someone tell me his real name?	Enti obi betumi aka ne din ankasa akyerɛ me?
It’s so simple and it’s such a beautiful song.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye na ɛyɛ dwom a ɛyɛ fɛ saa.
I want to know if they are the same.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛ ebia wɔyɛ pɛ anaa.
I would give you one.	Anka mede biako bɛma wo.
This city needs new infrastructure.	Kurow yi hia nneɛma foforo a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma.
For the article, go here.	Sɛ wopɛ asɛm no a, kɔ ha.
He just thought he was.	Ná osusuw ara kwa sɛ ɔte saa.
I don’t think so.	Minsusuw saa.
There is still much work to be done.	Adwuma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I know everybody well.	Me nim obiara yiye.
And it’s certainly not a desire.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ ɔpɛ.
Man and the dog.	Onipa ne ɔkraman.
I didn’t like saying that.	Ná m’ani nnye ho sɛ mɛka saa.
Go to your room.	Kɔ wo dan mu.
He didn't really know how it would work.	Ná onnim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ adwuma no ankasa.
The man will be there to feed the dog.	Ɔbarima no bɛba hɔ ama ɔkraman no aduan.
But it had happened.	Nanso na aba.
He could go at any time.	Ná obetumi akɔ bere biara.
Don’t take it for granted.	Mfa no sɛ biribiara.
The long drought has hit animals hard.	Ɔpɛ a akyɛ no aka mmoa kɛse.
It must have been exciting.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ anigye.
I saw my father in a different light.	Mihuu me papa wɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
Take your hands off.	Fa wo nsa so.
Every weekend was like this.	Ná dapɛn awiei biara te sɛ eyi.
Nobody knows.	Obiara nnim.
A huge mistake.	Mfomso kɛse bi.
You need to know what that is.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu nea ɛno yɛ.
I'm there.	Mewɔ hɔ.
He certainly didn’t know me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na onnim me.
I thought about that for a long time.	Misusuw saa asɛm no ho bere tenten.
Or at least very little.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, kakraa bi pɛ.
That perfect moment.	Saa bere a ɛyɛ pɛ no.
If it’s not mine.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ me de a.
We need to get him in the back of the car.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde no kɔ kar no akyi.
And who knows, maybe it is.	Na hena na onim, ebia ɛte saa.
Keep your eyes peeled.	Kɔ so ma w’ani nna hɔ.
He didn't want any of that.	Ná ɔmpɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara.
They were perfect for so many things.	Ná wɔyɛ pɛ ma nneɛma pii saa.
He lowered her to the ground.	Ɔde no sii fam.
It is not at all obvious.	Ɛnyɛ ade a ɛda adi koraa.
The story bothered me, still does, to this day.	Asɛm no haw me, ɛda so ara haw me, de besi nnɛ.
He hadn't heard anything interesting himself that night.	Ná ɔno ankasa nte biribi a ɛyɛ anigye anadwo no.
That was hard enough.	Ná saa asɛm no yɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ.
A few comments.	Nsɛm kakraa bi a wɔka.
I didn't have to drive here.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ mede kar kɔ ha.
And I don’t think you do.	Na minsusuw sɛ woyɛ saa.
No one can do it alone.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ no ɔno nkutoo.
I use it all the time!.	Mede di dwuma bere nyinaa!.
Make sure everything was okay.	Hwɛ hu sɛ na biribiara yɛ yiye.
He put it on the table.	Ɔde too pon no so.
But right now this doesn’t work.	Nanso seesei ara eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
Nobody says that.	Obiara nka saa.
And it was so.	Na ɛte saa.
Pa told him.	Pa ka kyerɛɛ no.
And we weren’t alone.	Na ɛnyɛ yɛn nkutoo.
A new movie.	Sini foforo bi.
As such this is not ideal.	Sɛnea ɛte no eyi nyɛ nea eye sen biara.
I can’t go to him.	Mintumi nkɔ ne nkyɛn.
After that, he lost interest in school.	Ɛno akyi no, na n’ani nnye sukuu ho bio.
I couldn’t believe it.	Na mintumi nnye nni.
He uses water.	Ɔde nsu na edi dwuma.
How could he forget?	Ɔbɛyɛ dɛn na ne werɛ afi?
That’s all that didn’t matter.	Ɛno nkutoo na na ɛho nhia.
We cannot thank you enough.	Yɛrentumi nna mo ase sɛnea ɛsɛ.
To anyone else, this might have sounded strange.	Wɔ obi foforo biara fam no, ebia na eyi bɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Even in the cases.	Wɔ nsɛm no mu no mpo.
Maybe he was there too.	Ebia na ɔno nso wɔ hɔ.
That’s what he thinks.	Ɛno ne nea osusuw.
The system is fairly simple.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛ nea ɛnyɛ den koraa.
But here is the truth.	Nanso nokware no ni.
So good enough.	Enti eye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
There was a first.	Ná nea edi kan koraa wɔ hɔ.
However, this did not happen.	Nanso, eyi amma mu.
I know that’s weird.	Minim sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
The problem is very serious.	Ɔhaw no mu yɛ den yiye.
I just felt it.	Metee nka ara kwa.
Each path led to a room.	Ná ɔkwan biara kɔ dan bi mu.
Take it easy, for now.	Fa no mmerɛw, mprempren.
Same time last year.	Bere koro no ara afe a etwaam no.
He was very curious.	Ná ɔpɛ nsɛm paa.
He took me home.	Ɔde me kɔɔ fie.
That’s a good thing.	Ɛno yɛ nea eye.
Why should I? 	Dɛn nti na me?
This was our home.	Ná eyi ne yɛn fie.
There is no work that is not necessary.	Adwuma biara nni hɔ a ɛho nhia.
They are games.	Wɔyɛ agoru ahorow a wɔde di agoru.
He’ll be happy here.	N’ani begye wɔ ha.
I had a lot of fun with many of them.	Me ne wɔn mu pii gyee wɔn ani pii.
I didn’t think it was a big deal.	Na minsusuw sɛ ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse.
That’s the point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no.
I'm not sure why this happens.	Me nnim nea enti a eyi ba.
None of us really knew why.	Ná yɛn mu biara nnim nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa.
Don’t tell anyone.	Nka nkyerɛ obiara.
And it works very well.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye paa.
But the problem is not surprising.	Nanso ɔhaw no nyɛ nwonwa.
Return to room temperature.	San kɔ dan mu hyew so.
I was part of it.	Ná meyɛ ne fã.
There is nothing.	Biribiara nni hɔ.
The power to create.	Tumi a wɔde bɔ ade.
But you have to see this from a different perspective.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu eyi wɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
The handsome man winked at me.	Ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ no de n’ani kyerɛɛ me.
And he knew it.	Na onim.
What is your favorite food?	Aduan bɛn na w’ani gye ho paa?
I know it’s somewhere.	Minim sɛ ɛwɔ baabi.
Except it was bad.	Gye sɛ na ɛyɛ bɔne.
Please visit mine if you have a chance.	Mesrɛ wo sɛ wowɔ hokwan a, kɔ me de no so.
Some schools are doing great.	Sukuu ahorow bi reyɛ adwuma kɛse.
The person in front turns around.	Onipa a ɔwɔ anim no dan ne ho.
They voted unanimously.	Wɔde adwene koro too aba.
And it still isn’t.	Na ɛda so ara nyɛ saa.
I love the classes and even a few days.	M’ani gye adesua ahorow no ne nna kakraa bi mpo ho.
I was there once.	Ná mewɔ hɔ bere bi.
He didn’t seem to have any close friends.	Ɛte sɛ nea na onni nnamfo paa biara.
Look at what we have.	Hwɛ nea yɛwɔ.
He was also brilliant.	Ná ɔno nso ho akokwaw.
He did not know them or fear them.	Ná onnim wɔn anaa wɔn suro.
Many people liked this story.	Nnipa pii ani gyee saa asɛm yi ho.
It was a great day.	Ná ɛyɛ da kɛse.
It sounds like an easy task but I’m surprised it’s not.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛnyɛ den nanso ɛyɛ me nwonwa sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
What he was doing feels like it.	Nea na ɔreyɛ no te nka sɛ ɛte.
But two things.	Nanso nneɛma abien.
I just felt great in that moment.	Metee nka kɛse ara kwa wɔ saa bere no mu.
Not that you can’t already.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ worentumi nyɛ saa dedaw.
This was a while ago.	Eyi yɛ bere tiaa bi a atwam ni.
Say, he paints.	Ka sɛ, ɔyɛ mfonini.
But it’s just not true.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nokware kɛkɛ.
He doesn't know why, but this last state did relieve him.	Onnim nea enti a ɛte saa, nanso tebea a etwa to yi ho tɔɔ no ampa.
That story is now.	Saa asɛm no ne mprempren.
There are a lot of them out there.	Wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
I certainly felt that way.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ metee nka saa.
These people are very wrong.	Saa nkurɔfo yi di mfomso kɛse.
I love these people here.	M’ani gye saa nnipa yi ho wɔ ha.
Be honest with yourself.	Di wo ho nokware.
Your child is in it.	Wo ba no wɔ mu.
In that sense, we are a real team.	Wɔ saa kwan no so no, yɛyɛ kuw ankasa bi.
The dog had to stay outside.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkraman no tra abɔnten.
The day of the month.	Ɔsram no mu da.
He wanted more, more.	Ná ɔpɛ pii, pii.
This worked well for me.	Eyi yɛɛ adwuma yiye maa me.
He has this.	Ɔwɔ eyi.
This technique works on a wide variety of surfaces.	Saa ɔkwan yi yɛ adwuma wɔ nneɛma ahorow pii so.
It was amazing to be a part of it.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ wobɛyɛ ne fã.
I would have done the same.	Anka me nso mɛyɛ saa.
But in the end, it never works.	Nanso awiei koraa no, ɛnyɛ adwuma da.
I put my foot down.	Mede me nan sii fam.
Something very big, very old.	Biribi kɛse paa, akyɛ paa.
So, you know, there’s that.	Enti, wunim, ɛno wɔ hɔ.
He was the most brilliant man of his time.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho akokwaw sen biara wɔ ne bere so.
But it is not at all.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
He had to do that now.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa mprempren.
You might be interested in them.	Ebia w’ani begye wɔn ho.
He also didn't seem to know what was going on.	Ɛte sɛ nea na onnim nea ɛrekɔ so nso.
So why more of one than the other.	Enti dɛn nti na biako pii wɔ hɔ sen biako no.
Everything is true as it is now.	Biribiara yɛ nokware sɛnea ɛte mprempren no.
I was almost non-existent.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na minni hɔ.
Same thing every time.	Ade koro no ara bere biara.
But it wasn’t just him.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɔno ara kwa.
They bought something out of it with their money.	Wɔde wɔn sika tɔɔ biribi fii mu.
The same is true now.	Ɛte saa mprempren nso.
He had a bit of a face, and you have to hand him that.	Na ɔwɔ anim kakra, na ɛsɛ sɛ wode saa no hyɛ no nsa.
And past, done.	Na atwam, ayɛ.
It will be great for everyone else but me .	Ɛbɛyɛ kɛse ama obiara a aka gye me nkutoo .
That might have been a better option.	Ebia na ɛno bɛyɛ ɔkwan a eye sen saa.
The children were unaware of the danger.	Ná mmofra no nnim asiane no.
I didn’t know what to think.	Na minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
We were doing the same thing.	Ná yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa.
Now they tell me.	Seesei wɔka kyerɛ me.
Walk me back.	Nantew me san kɔ.
But these people don’t really have a say.	Nanso saa nkurɔfo yi nni asɛm biara ka ankasa.
Everyone was completely shocked.	Obiara ho dwiriw no koraa.
I can’t tell him.	Mintumi nka nkyerɛ no.
They were good at that.	Na wɔyɛ papa wɔ saa adwuma no mu.
I’m interested in you.	M’ani gye wo ho.
This is not easy.	Eyi nyɛ mmerɛw.
They tell stories.	Wɔka nsɛm.
And they do that.	Na wɔyɛ saa.
There must be a mistake here somewhere.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mfomso bi wɔ ha wɔ baabi.
That’s in the morning.	Ɛno yɛ anɔpa.
Everything else.	Biribiara foforo biara.
I knew that city inside and out.	Ná minim saa kurow no mu ne akyi.
The food police are at it again.	Aduan ho polisifo no wɔ so bio.
I was the one he had in common.	Me na na ɔne no wɔ biribi a ɛyɛ pɛ.
Remember, he is no longer a child.	Kae sɛ ɔnyɛ abofra bio.
And not nearly enough.	Na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
Tell me, tell me.	Ka kyerɛ me, ka kyerɛ me.
He is good enough, and surely he will be good enough.	Ɔyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ, na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
But that didn’t work.	Nanso ɛno anyɛ yiye.
He knows where they are weak.	Onim baabi a wɔyɛ mmerɛw.
And that’s what it is.	Na ɛno ne no.
They should not be trusted.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn ho to wɔn so.
More of the same this year.	Nneɛma a ɛte saa ara ho pii afe yi.
I don’t think there is yet.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ de besi nnɛ.
But tell him to do something else.	Nanso ka kyerɛ no sɛ ɔnyɛ biribi foforo.
Give them some space.	Ma wɔn baabi kakra.
I'm somewhere else.	Mewɔ baabi foforo.
That might be my favorite movie ever.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ sini a m’ani gye ho kɛse sen biara.
There is no need for him to do so.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
It didn't matter, but he seemed to think it mattered before.	Ná ɛho nhia, nanso na ɛte sɛ nea na osusuw sɛ ɛho hia saa pɛn.
I really wanted to.	Ná mepɛ paa.
It was an opportunity to do so.	Ná ɛyɛ hokwan a mede bɛyɛ saa.
It’s cold, but I’m warm.	Awɔw wom, nanso me ho yɛ hyew.
There is something here.	Biribi wɔ ha.
You are at work now.	Wo wɔ adwuma mu mprempren.
These shoes are gorgeous.	Saa mpaboa yi yɛ fɛ yiye.
Not too bad, but not as good as in his pictures.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne dodo, nanso ɛnyɛ te sɛ nea ɛwɔ ne mfonini ahorow mu no.
Two children were in school.	Ná mmofra baanu wɔ sukuu mu.
This time it didn’t go any better.	Saa bere yi antumi ankɔ yiye biara.
In this case, the other way around.	Wɔ eyi mu no, ɔkwan foforo so.
However, it does from time to time.	Nanso, ɛte saa bere ne bere mu.
He’s terrible.	Ɔyɛ hu.
Tell yourself that everything will be fine.	Ka kyerɛ wo ho sɛ biribiara bɛyɛ yiye.
I have this one.	Mewɔ eyi.
He certainly never did.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔnyɛ no saa da.
Don’t make it necessary anymore.	Mma ɛho nhia bio.
Maybe I don’t have much time.	Ebia minni bere pii.
However, it may not be.	Nanso, ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
You're worried about yourself.	Wo ho haw wo ho.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I can’t go to them.	Mintumi nkɔ wɔn nkyɛn.
This is usually money.	Eyi taa yɛ sika.
I saw the good and not so good first.	Mihuu nea eye na ɛnyɛ papa saa no kan.
And there was nothing.	Na biribiara nni hɔ.
Naturally this causes problems.	Sɛnea ɛte no eyi de ɔhaw ahorow ba.
A very nice power.	Tumi a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
This is a popular dish.	Eyi yɛ aduan a nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
So, it’s pretty cool.	Enti, ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Not that people actually believed it.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ nkurɔfo gye dii ankasa.
But think about this.	Nanso susuw eyi ho hwɛ.
However, one must be realistic.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ nea ɔyɛ ankasa.
It felt solid and complete.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den na edi mũ.
It’s not with me.	Ɛnyɛ me nkyɛn.
I’m so glad you’re here.	M’ani agye yiye sɛ wowɔ ha.
It lives in you, it’s a part of you.	Ɛte wo mu, ɛyɛ wo fã.
The music touched him deeply.	Nnwom no kaa no kɛse.
It wasn’t really true that no one noticed.	Na ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa sɛ obiara anhu.
His hair is also wet.	Ne ti nhwi nso ayɛ nsu.
You are not alone.	Ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo.
You were my last resort.	Na wo ne me kwan a etwa to.
I think he wanted to.	Misusuw sɛ na ɔpɛ.
I think he was like that.	Misusuw sɛ na ɔte saa.
He absolutely loved them.	N’ani gyee wɔn ho koraa.
This may take another month.	Ebia eyi begye ɔsram foforo bi.
However, it was true.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ nokware.
It’s not all bad, either.	Ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa bɔne, nso.
Say it out loud a few times.	Ka no den mpɛn kakraa bi.
I thought about it for the first time.	Misusuw ho nea edi kan.
There is something wonderful about them.	Biribi wɔ wɔn ho a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
See how that works out long term.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛno yɛ adwuma bere tenten.
However, everything else is wrong.	Nanso, biribiara a aka no yɛ mfomso.
There must be something we can do.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ.
It was a fascinating experience.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye.
And even those few forgot about it almost immediately.	Na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ saa nnipa kakraa bi mpo werɛ fii no ntɛm ara.
But if you take the time	Nanso sɛ wugye bere de .
A man is a terrible thing.	Ɔbarima yɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu.
The phone in the bedroom rang just then.	Telefon a ɛwɔ mpa no mu no bɔɔ denneennen saa bere no ara mu.
A book, perhaps.	Nhoma bi, ebia.
But it all went horribly wrong.	Nanso ne nyinaa kɔɔ bɔne a ɛyɛ hu.
You get a copy of the book.	Wo nsa ka nhoma no bi.
That was true.	Ná ɛno yɛ nokware.
But he wasn’t.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ saa.
Something big has happened.	Asɛm kɛse bi asi.
Can someone please help me on what exactly this means.	Mesrɛ sɛ obi betumi aboa me wɔ nea eyi kyerɛ ankasa ho.
If so, someone could have shown me how.	Sɛ saa a, anka obi betumi akyerɛ me sɛnea ɛte.
He was very popular at the party.	Ná nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho kɛse wɔ apontow no ase.
He could always find information.	Ná obetumi anya nsɛm bere nyinaa.
I really didn’t know if that was a good thing or not.	Ankasa na minnim sɛ ebia ɛno yɛ ade pa anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
He knows what people expect from him.	Onim nea nkurɔfo hwɛ kwan fi ne hɔ.
It’s their money.	Ɛyɛ wɔn sika.
I want to get to know you better.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wo yiye.
Definitely give this one a shot.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ma eyi biako no tuo.
He has to.	Ɔwɔ sɛ.
Would you please do this for me?	Mesrɛ wo, wobɛyɛ eyi ama me?
No such circumstance exists in the instant case.	Tebea a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ wɔ asɛm a ɛwɔ hɔ ntɛm ara no mu.
I really want to talk to him.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa ampa.
The people felt real, not just characters.	Nkurɔfo no tee nka sɛ wɔyɛ nnipa ankasa, na ɛnyɛ nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm kɛkɛ.
You gave it to him.	Wode no maa no.
If you want to take a test now, we will do it now.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ sɔhwɛ mprempren a, yɛbɛyɛ no mprempren.
We need to forget this game.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn werɛ fi saa agoru yi.
Maybe it was like a game for both of you.	Ebia na ɛte sɛ agoru ma mo baanu nyinaa.
They were too fast.	Ná wɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
Everyone knew it.	Ná obiara nim.
Beautiful, beautiful things.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ a ɛyɛ fɛ.
That was the case with me.	Saa na na ɛte wɔ me fam.
I have some of it.	Mewɔ bi.
They even started with a problem.	Wɔde ɔhaw bi mpo fii ase.
There seems to be a girl.	Ɛte sɛ nea abeawa bi wɔ hɔ.
That table is no longer needed.	Saa pon no ho nhia bio.
. . . .	.
I can't really figure out what the problem is.	Mintumi nhu nea ɛyɛ ɔhaw no ankasa.
There are pros and cons.	Nneɛma pa ne nneɛma bɔne wɔ hɔ.
And it wasn’t anymore.	Na ɛnyɛ bio.
I think he must have forgotten or something.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ne werɛ fi anaa biribi.
They were very beautiful.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Every man she talks to gets involved.	Ɔbarima biara a ɔne no kasa no de ne ho hyɛ mu.
No one knows what happened there.	Obiara nnim nea esii wɔ hɔ.
By the way.	Kwan ho.
It’s a power we all have.	Ɛyɛ tumi a yɛn nyinaa wɔ.
I don’t want to say anything.	Mempɛ sɛ meka asɛm biara.
That was painful, too.	Ɛno nso yɛɛ yaw.
I understand how much it must hurt inside.	Mete sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo yaw kɛse wɔ wo mu no ase.
There is no such power.	Tumi a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ.
What had happened after that.	Nea na asi wɔ ɛno akyi.
It all stayed in him.	Ne nyinaa traa ne mu.
The same is true of the direction you are heading.	Saa ara na ɔkwan a w’ani kyerɛ no nso te.
I want to hear from him.	Mepɛ sɛ mete ne nsɛm.
There aren’t many stories like that.	Nsɛm pii nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
Usually in an evening.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛyɛ anwummere bi.
I was a human being.	Ná meyɛ onipa.
So many children, so little food.	Mmofra pii saa, aduan kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Or disagree with him.	Anaasɛ wo ne no nyɛ adwene.
However, where the matter.	Nanso, baabi a asɛm no.
Maybe you can make him more interested.	Ebia wubetumi ama n’ani agye ho yiye.
And the kids understood.	Na mmofra no tee ase.
As you may know.	Sɛnea ebia wunim no.
I need to know that you can do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛ wubetumi ayɛ saa.
There is food here.	Aduan wɔ ha.
I was doing the same thing.	Ná me nso meyɛ saa.
But not in the way you mean it.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɔkwan a wopɛ sɛ woka no so.
John cycled to work.	John de sakre kɔɔ adwuma.
Her hair was matted.	Ná ne ti nhwi no ayɛ mmerɛw.
There was no one on the street.	Ná obiara nni abɔnten so.
The same is true of water.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nsu ho.
I know this.	Minim eyi.
So it’s a necessity.	Enti ɛyɛ ade a ɛho hia.
Everyone should have been happy.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ obiara ani gye.
At least watch the game.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, hwɛ agoru no.
I have known him well over the years.	Minim no yiye wɔ mfe pii a atwam no mu.
Nevertheless, one must make an effort.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɛsɛ sɛ obi bɔ mmɔden.
He spent the weekend with her.	Ɔne no dii dapɛn awiei no.
He was a matter of opinion.	Ná ɔyɛ adwene mu asɛm.
Not by hand.	Ɛnyɛ nsa so.
I'm important.	Me ho hia.
That had to be good.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ papa.
And it should should be a little easier already.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw kakra dedaw.
I know this is the way.	Minim sɛ eyi ne ɔkwan no.
Winter was finally over.	Ná awɔw bere no atwam awiei koraa.
He gave me a smile.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ me so.
Or does he do that.	Anaasɛ ɔyɛ saa.
He was very good.	Ná ɔyɛ papa paa.
But I'd better go.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ mɛkɔ.
It doesn’t even have to be perfect.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mpo na ɛyɛ pɛ.
They all raised their heads.	Wɔn nyinaa maa wɔn ti so.
He had done those years.	Ná wayɛ saa mfe no.
It doesn't seem to work though.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ adwuma nanso.
I think it’s a lie.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ atoro.
I haven’t thought about that book in years.	Mfe pii ni a minsusuw saa nhoma no ho.
That seemed easy enough.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
You have to accept that too.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso wugye saa asɛm no tom.
Put on some warm clothes.	Hyɛ ntade bi a ɛyɛ hyew.
He didn't want to say.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka.
It’s not as easy as it may seem.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ebia ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛte no.
It’s hard to say this quickly.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka eyi ntɛm.
Many of the features.	Nneɛma pii a ɛwɔ mu.
Your name is in front of mine.	Wo din wɔ me de anim.
He touched her hand.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne nsa.
For many, this is a big deal.	Wɔ nnipa pii fam no, eyi yɛ asɛm kɛse.
Maybe it really is a lie.	Ebia ɛyɛ atoro ampa.
And it’s a strong one.	Na ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
Some of my stuff is here in the main house.	Me nneɛma bi wɔ ha wɔ ofie kɛse no mu.
Music is almost universal	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nnwom yɛ ade a ɛwɔ nnipa nyinaa mu
Sleep here as long as you like.	Da ha bere tenten biara a wopɛ.
I wanted to feel something.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mete biribi nka.
Just like the last time.	Te sɛ bere a etwa to no ara pɛ.
It’s a little dangerous.	Asiane wom kakra.
People assumed you did want it.	Nkurɔfo faa no sɛ wopɛ ampa.
That’s not my name.	Ɛno nyɛ me din.
It’s wonderful to talk about.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ wobɛka ho asɛm.
Just like yesterday.	Te sɛ nea ɛte nnɛra no.
I know him.	Minim no.
And it may be happening now.	Na ebia ɛrekɔ so mprempren.
I use the bus every day.	Mede bɔs no di dwuma da biara da.
Three more hours.	Nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa bio.
There was a loud music party going on.	Ná nnwom a ano yɛ den apontow bi rekɔ so.
But he seems to like it.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye ho.
That’s how our system works.	Saa na yɛn nhyehyɛe no fa so yɛ adwuma.
These people need to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ saa nkurɔfo yi kɔ.
These shoes are made from the highest quality leather.	Wɔde aboa nhoma a ɛyɛ papa sen biara na ɛyɛ mpaboa yi.
All that power, all the time.	Saa tumi no nyinaa, bere nyinaa.
Your father often goes away for work.	Wo papa taa kɔ adwuma nti.
I would appreciate any help with this.	M’ani begye mmoa biara a wɔde bɛma wɔ eyi ho.
It may be a very long night.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ anadwo tenten paa.
You are treating me well.	Wo ne me di yiye.
They told their father.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ wɔn papa.
These books are gorgeous.	Saa nhoma ahorow yi yɛ fɛ yiye.
I’m the only one.	Me nkutoo.
This road is really going to get crowded.	Ɔkwan yi rekɔ so ayɛ ma ankasa.
It was very cold that day.	Ná awɔw wom kɛse saa da no.
So I don’t know what it is.	Enti me nnim nea ɛyɛ.
This is a very important document.	Eyi yɛ krataa a ɛho hia yiye.
But then he didn’t have to do much about it.	Nanso saa bere no na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ho biribi kɛse.
Your hair is too long for this outfit.	Wo ti nhwi tenten dodo ma saa atade yi.
It doesn’t matter what people think.	Nea nkurɔfo susuw ho no mfa ho.
But you know what people are like.	Nanso wunim sɛnea nnipa te.
And he did so.	Na ɔyɛɛ saa.
There are many of them.	Pii wɔ wɔn mu.
But he wanted to do that.	Nanso na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
We just got it right.	Yɛn nsa kaa no ara kwa.
I expect it to be so.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
The language is hands-on.	Kasa no yɛ nsa.
The car is not available for the rest of the game.	Kar no ntumi nkɔ agoru no fã a aka no mu.
You can’t predict how things will turn out.	Worentumi nhu sɛnea nneɛma bɛkɔ so.
The painting was returned to him with great enthusiasm.	Wɔde anigye kɛse san de mfonini no maa no.
But don’t take it too far, either.	Nanso mfa nkɔ akyiri dodo, nso.
It didn’t feel like enough but it felt okay.	Na ɛnte nka sɛ ɛdɔɔso nanso na ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ yiye.
This view is completely wrong.	Saa adwene yi yɛ mfomso koraa.
So we are very sorry about that.	Enti ɛyɛ yɛn yaw paa wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I felt completely out of control.	Metee nka sɛ mintumi nni me ho so koraa.
It wasn’t even pretty.	Ná ɛnyɛ fɛ mpo.
It is the way of his people.	Ɛyɛ ne nkurɔfo kwan.
I'll give you another one, just as good.	Mede foforo bɛma wo, saa ara na eye.
It looks like it though.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte nanso.
Usually it is.	Mpɛn pii no ɛte saa.
Mother was very beautiful.	Ná Maame ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Real words matter.	Nsɛm ankasa ho hia.
Just accept it.	Gye tom kɛkɛ.
Whether he likes money.	Sɛ́ ebia n’ani gye sika ho.
It was their home for the rest of their lives.	Ná ɛyɛ wɔn fie wɔ wɔn nkwa nna nyinaa mu.
I was hit by a squirrel.	Ɔkraman bi bɔɔ me.
It was a man	Ná ɛyɛ onipa bi .
Use very hot water.	Fa nsu a ɛyɛ hyew yiye di dwuma.
I told you where it was.	Meka kyerɛɛ wo baabi a ɛwɔ.
I really think this works.	Misusuw ankasa sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma.
Believe in yourself.	Gye wo ho di.
Maybe we will do the same.	Ebia yɛn nso yɛbɛyɛ saa.
I am not the only one who can do that.	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na metumi ayɛ saa.
He just puts himself first.	Ɔde ne ho di kan kɛkɛ.
More details will follow soon.	Nsɛm pii bedi akyi nnansa yi ara.
On my last night.	Me anadwo a etwa to no.
You could see the excitement in his eyes.	Ná wubetumi ahu anigye a ɛwɔ n’ani so no.
But there is no time now.	Nanso bere biara nni hɔ mprempren.
Again, not so good.	Bio nso, ɛnyɛ papa saa.
Take it from someone who knows.	Fa fi obi a onim hɔ.
I still remember him.	Meda so ara kae no.
I leaned in closer.	Mede me ho too mu bɛn no kɛse.
He did a wonderful job.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He's just doing it.	Ɔreyɛ ayɛ no ara kwa.
He put his name down.	Ɔde ne din too hɔ.
But it’s not both.	Nanso ɛnyɛ abien no nyinaa.
That’s what our money does.	Ɛno ne nea yɛn sika yɛ.
His mother was soft on him.	Ná ne maame yɛ mmerɛw wɔ ne ho.
They enjoyed many parties.	Wɔn ani gyee apontow ahorow pii ho.
Do this several times.	Yɛ eyi mpɛn pii.
But not what he wanted to play with today.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde di agoru nnɛ.
But he didn't want any of them.	Nanso na ɔmpɛ wɔn mu biara.
The whole system involves two things.	Nhyehyɛe no nyinaa fa nneɛma abien ho.
We need to give them that opportunity.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde saa hokwan no ma wɔn.
He thought this was a good thing.	Ná osusuw sɛ eyi yɛ ade pa.
There is no doubt that such a situation is common.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ tebea a ɛte saa abu so.
She had never looked better.	Ná ne ho nyɛ fɛ sen saa da.
But you can make the situation better.	Nanso wubetumi ama tebea no ayɛ yiye.
He lives from hand to mouth.	Ɔte ase fi nsa kosi ano.
And he may be older.	Na ebia ne mfe akɔ anim.
His hands didn’t touch the table, at least.	Ne nsa ankɔ pon no so, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
He spent most of his life alone.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔde ne nkwa nna fã kɛse no ara dii dwuma.
It was all as it should be.	Ná ne nyinaa te sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no.
But that is not really the case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛte saa ankasa.
He had a past.	Ná ɔwɔ bere bi a atwam no.
Actually do it this time.	Yɛ no ankasa saa bere yi.
And indeed it was.	Na ampa ara na ɛte saa.
You do a lot of work.	Woyɛ adwuma pii.
Look at our qualities.	Hwɛ yɛn su ahorow no.
People know it.	Nkurɔfo nim.
There was no one there.	Na obiara nni hɔ.
It may be true.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nokware.
It’s that big of a deal.	Ɛyɛ kɛse saa.
Remove these people from power.	Yi saa nkurɔfo yi mfi tumi mu.
I put my foot down.	Mede me nan too fam.
There is absolutely no life in it.	Nkwa biara nni mu koraa.
It was one of the most beautiful things.	Na ɛyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ sen biara no mu biako.
However, there was an issue.	Nanso, na asɛm bi wɔ hɔ.
But that often misses the point.	Nanso ɛno taa pa asɛm no.
Don’t just survive.	Nnya nkwa kɛkɛ.
But anyway, there is such a thing.	Nanso sɛnea ɛte biara no, ade a ɛte saa wɔ hɔ.
So who knows.	Enti hena na onim.
This affects not only manufacturing.	Ɛnyɛ nneɛma a wɔyɛ nkutoo na eyi ka.
The animals must sleep.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mmoa no da.
Can you tell?	So wubetumi ahu?
They were given everything.	Wɔde wɔn maa biribiara.
Not exactly a good use of money.	Ɛnyɛ sika a wɔde di dwuma yiye ankasa.
That child is me.	Saa abofra no ne me.
I could do all of that.	Ná metumi ayɛ saa nneɛma no nyinaa.
There seems to be no hope left.	Ɛte sɛ nea anidaso biara nni hɔ a aka.
This goes for the pictures as well.	Eyi kɔ ma mfonini ahorow no nso.
She seemed so happy and beautiful.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye na ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
He didn’t like her.	Ná n’ani nnye ne ho.
So people expected more from him.	Enti nkurɔfo hwɛɛ pii kwan fi ne hɔ.
I know that’s important to you.	Minim sɛ ɛno ho hia wo.
The man worked on everything.	Ɔbarima no yɛɛ biribiara ho adwuma.
Make sure you have plenty of water.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wowɔ nsu pii.
I will feel better in the morning.	Me ho bɛyɛ den anɔpa.
I thought you were for me.	Misusuwii sɛ woyɛ ma me.
That was all he had to think about.	Ɛno nkutoo ne nea na ɛsɛ sɛ osusuw ho.
And that’s your problem, not anyone else’s.	Na ɛno ne wo haw, ɛnyɛ obi foforo biara.
However, this issue is not usually a problem.	Nanso, asɛm yi nyɛ ɔhaw mpɛn pii.
As we shall now.	Sɛnea yɛbɛyɛ mprempren no.
Identity is a powerful thing.	Nnipa a obi yɛ no yɛ ade a tumi wom.
We can handle it.	Yebetumi adi ho dwuma.
They were about his age.	Ná wɔyɛ bɛyɛ ne mfe.
The price of raw materials has plummeted.	Nneɛma a wɔde yɛ nneɛma bo akɔ fam kɛse.
No part of me is wrong.	Me fã biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ mfomso.
This was their way.	Ná eyi ne wɔn kwan.
He seemed to understand.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔte ase.
It’s the issue at the time.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛwɔ hɔ saa bere no.
This city has something for everyone.	Kurow yi wɔ biribi ma obiara.
Glad you liked them.	Anigye sɛ w’ani gyee wɔn ho.
There was just a game.	Ná agoru bi kɛkɛ wɔ hɔ.
We can all see that this is wrong.	Yɛn nyinaa tumi hu sɛ eyi yɛ mfomso.
It’s a beautiful thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
He is also strong.	Ɔno nso ho yɛ den.
I even think about it maybe.	Misusuw ho mpo sɛ ebia.
This picture is dedicated to my mother.	Saa mfonini yi yɛ nea wɔde ama me maame.
But only for you.	Nanso wo nkutoo de.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni ha.
I don’t think it’s over.	Minsusuw sɛ aba awiei.
You, too, man.	Wo nso, ɔbarima.
The books are inside only.	Nhoma ahorow no yɛ nea ɛwɔ mu nkutoo.
The food industry is a mess.	Aduan ho adwuma no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
I was at a meeting.	Ná mewɔ nhyiam bi ase.
He didn't care about his clothes or shoes.	Ná ne ntade anaa ne mpaboa mfa ne ho.
Where anything can happen.	Baabi a biribiara betumi asi.
He works there.	Ɔyɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ.
The power was immense.	Ná tumi no yɛ kɛse.
I can’t get to you.	Mintumi nkɔ wo nkyɛn.
But they are children.	Nanso wɔyɛ mmofra.
It had to be that way.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
They were always with each other.	Ná wɔka wɔn ho wɔn ho ho bere nyinaa.
They are beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
There are many dangers ahead.	Asiane pii da yɛn anim.
A few days later, the same thing happened.	Nna kakraa bi akyi no, ade koro no ara sii.
He set out on his own.	Ɔno ankasa sii kwan so.
It was an absolutely beautiful affair, and everyone was happy.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ fɛ koraa, na na obiara ani gye.
And the time is.	Na bere no yɛ.
I don’t think anyone did.	Minsusuw sɛ obiara anyɛ saa.
Get them out of the city.	Yi wɔn fi kurow no mu.
It shouldn’t work, but here we are.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yiye, nanso yɛwɔ ha.
Please just do it.	Mesrɛ wo, yɛ no ara kwa.
But maybe we shouldn’t.	Nanso ebia ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
He was a tall, handsome man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima tenten a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
And something else.	Na biribi foforo nso.
And this girl, too.	Na abeawa yi nso.
Everything is about this age.	Biribiara fa saa mfe yi ho.
He didn't seem to be a short man.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔnyɛ onipa tiaa.
There is nothing else to add.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛka ho.
However, there are some problems with this approach.	Nanso, ɔhaw ahorow bi wɔ saa kwan yi ho.
It’s complicated though.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den nanso.
He knew that much.	Ná onim saa nneɛma pii.
With the simple pictures.	Ne mfonini ahorow a ɛnyɛ den no.
I couldn’t imagine the two of them sitting here doing anything.	Na mintumi nsusuw ho sɛ wɔn baanu no te ha reyɛ biribiara.
Don’t be afraid of it.	Mma w’ani nnye ho.
Such a human nature.	Onipa su a ɛte saa.
He focused on the incident.	Ɔde n’adwene sii asɛm a na ɛrekɔ so no so.
I will use them again.	Mede wɔn bedi dwuma bio.
I don’t think he likes it very much.	Minsusuw sɛ n’ani gye ho kɛse.
Go back there immediately.	San kɔ hɔ ntɛm ara.
He was very busy.	Ná onni adagyew koraa.
The child in me loved it too.	Abofra a ɔwɔ me mu no nso ani gyee ho.
Make sure the date is there though.	Hwɛ hu sɛ da no wɔ hɔ nanso.
He seemed to enjoy it.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye ho.
I didn’t know his first name.	Ná minnim ne din a edi kan no.
It was supposed to be a very happy day.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ da a anigye kɛse wom.
I know it was you.	Minim sɛ na ɛyɛ wo.
There was even some excitement.	Ná anigye bi mpo wɔ hɔ.
And it was there.	Na ɛwɔ hɔ.
That still has nothing to do with when this happened.	Ɛno da so ara ne bere a eyi sii no nni hwee yɛ.
It is very good indeed.	Eye paa ampa.
The story was interesting.	Ná asɛm no yɛ anigye.
Food is life.	Aduan yɛ nkwa.
He wanted them both.	Ná ɔpɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa.
So long as he was there, one sensed that there were some good things.	Enti bere tenten a na ɔwɔ hɔ no, obi tee nka sɛ nneɛma pa bi wɔ hɔ.
Either way, thank them.	Ɔkwan biara so no, da wɔn ase.
Nobody wants him.	Obiara mpɛ no.
It just wasn’t mine.	Ná ɛnyɛ me de kɛkɛ.
I was so excited.	Ná m’ani agye yiye.
This is so rare.	Eyi ho yɛ na saa.
But the good stuff.	Nanso nneɛma pa no.
All of that stuff isn’t really part of what this is.	Saa nneɛma no nyinaa nyɛ nea eyi yɛ no fã ankasa.
That guy looks a lot like him.	Saa ɔbarima no te sɛ ɔno yiye.
We may not be able to do that.	Ebia yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
That meant she had to work at home.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma wɔ fie.
Nothing to do now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ mprempren.
A sense of hope.	Anidaso a obi te nka.
Can you bring this dish to the table?	So wubetumi de saa aduan yi aba pon no so?
A great deal, even.	Ade kɛse bi, mpo.
Nothing is just copied.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wɔyɛ no mfonini ara kwa.
Take good care of your dog.	Hwɛ wo kraman no yiye.
A house is a house.	Ofie yɛ ofie yɛ.
There was always something new, something more challenging.	Na biribi foforo wɔ hɔ bere biara, biribi a ɛyɛ den sen saa.
But that’s not really the whole thing.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ ade mũ no nyinaa ankasa.
Inside, though, there was a great deal of work to be done.	Nanso, wɔ mu no, na adwuma kɛse bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
That’s what it is.	Ɛno na ɛyɛ.
I am in control now.	Me na mewɔ tumi mprempren.
These results are included here.	Wɔde nea afi mu aba yi aka ho wɔ ha.
It’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Which is generally true.	Nea mpɛn pii no ɛyɛ nokware.
He didn't even have to say it.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔka mpo.
They are important and wonderful things.	Wɔyɛ nneɛma a ɛho hia na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Glad you’re interested.	Anigye sɛ w’ani gye ho.
He had many friends.	Ná ɔwɔ nnamfo pii.
Tonight is the night.	Anadwo yi yɛ anadwo no.
I also liked the price.	M’ani gyee bo no nso ho.
I don’t know how they do it.	Minnim sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
The gun followed them.	Tuo no dii wɔn akyi.
Too bad your dad couldn’t come, though.	Nanso, ɛyɛ yaw dodo sɛ wo papa antumi amma.
So put something away.	Enti fa biribi to hɔ.
Not at all.	Ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
There is nothing but that.	Biribiara nni hɔ gye saa.
But one has to take a closer look.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ obi hwɛ mu yiye.
The industry is in decline.	Nnwuma no rekɔ fam.
That’s the way it is now.	Saa na ɛte mprempren.
I just don’t feel like that anymore.	Me nte nka saa bio kɛkɛ.
No real surprise there.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa ankasa wɔ hɔ.
I'll give it a better name.	Mede din a eye sen saa bɛma no.
You would be easier.	Anka wo ho bɛyɛ mmerɛw.
But he knew too much.	Nanso na onim nneɛma pii dodo.
There wasn’t much planning for his half.	Na nhyehyɛe pii nni hɔ mma ne fã.
There are a number of reasons for this.	Nneɛma ahorow bi nti na ɛte saa.
It was like it was.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛte.
Discuss that with them first.	Di kan ne wɔn nsusuw saa asɛm no ho.
You never knew about these things.	Na wunnim saa nneɛma yi ho asɛm da.
This program will cost you money.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi begye wo sika.
These things are not true.	Saa nneɛma yi nyɛ nokware.
Be careful what you wish for.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ nea wopɛ ho.
I think this is a great movie.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ sini kɛse.
That’s as simple as that.	Ɛno yɛ mmerɛw te sɛ ɛno.
Not great, not even good.	Ɛnyɛ kɛse, ɛnyɛ papa mpo.
But it’s not just that.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa ara kwa.
However, it is difficult to actually do anything about this.	Nanso, ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ eyi ho biribi ankasa.
This is obviously not true.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nyɛ nokware.
It was no longer his habit.	Ná ɛnyɛ ne su bio.
It probably didn’t matter.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛnyɛ hwee.
It was very cold.	Ná awɔw wom kɛse.
Anyone can work.	Obiara betumi ayɛ adwuma.
And that would be a work thing.	Na ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma mu ade.
That did two things.	Ɛno yɛɛ nneɛma abien.
That will definitely happen soon.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno bɛba nnansa yi ara.
You know how to do it now.	Wunim sɛnea wobɛyɛ no mprempren.
Nevertheless, the situation is not hopeless.	Ne nyinaa mu no, tebea no nyɛ nea anidaso biara nnim.
But that’s what happened in this case.	Nanso ɛno ne nea esii wɔ asɛm yi mu.
He was playing games.	Ná odi agoru.
One result is an abundance of information.	Nea afi mu aba biako ne nsɛm a ɛdɔɔso.
The scenery is amazing.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ nwonwa.
He was always in control.	Ná ɔno na odi tumi bere nyinaa.
He knew how to put a song on it.	Ná onim sɛnea wɔde dwom bi to so.
Owning two cars.	Kar abien a yɛwɔ.
Just for practice purposes.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ na wɔde ayɛ adesua ara kwa.
As of right now, it’s still too early.	Sɛnea ɛte mprempren yi ara, ɛda so ara yɛ ntɛm dodo.
The time had come.	Ná bere no adu.
I have a very good plan.	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe pa ara.
There are few risks.	Asiane kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I don't quite know what's going on.	Minnim nea ɛrekɔ so no yiye.
This will just be great, just great.	Eyi bɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa, ɛbɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa.
That’s why they do what they do.	Ɛno nti na wɔyɛ nea wɔyɛ no.
This is a difficult thing.	Eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ den.
We do this for you as we do ourselves.	Yɛyɛ eyi ma mo sɛnea yɛn ankasa yɛ no.
He took the dog for a long walk.	Ɔde ɔkraman no nantew tenten.
It’s good for everyone involved.	Ɛyɛ papa ma obiara a ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu.
But that’s not a problem.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ ɔhaw.
No one saw anything.	Obiara anhu hwee.
All as it always was.	Ne nyinaa te sɛ nea na ɛte bere nyinaa no.
Time had passed.	Ná bere atwam.
Check out the article here.	Hwɛ asɛm no wɔ ha.
People didn’t see him.	Nkurɔfo anhu no.
He was here a while ago.	Ná ɔwɔ ha bere tiaa bi a atwam ni.
And it was even worse.	Na na ɛyɛ bɔne sen saa mpo.
You can handle this.	Wubetumi adi eyi ho dwuma.
But there were problems.	Nanso na ɔhaw ahorow wɔ hɔ.
I really enjoyed this one.	M’ani gyee eyi ho ankasa.
I’m glad you’re here.	M’ani agye sɛ wowɔ ha.
Again, this is a good point.	Bio nso, eyi yɛ asɛm pa.
I shouldn’t be here at all.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ mewɔ ha koraa.
He definitely wants to be good.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ papa.
I just had it there.	Na mewɔ bi wɔ hɔ ara kwa.
Let him go.	Ma no nkɔ.
Your name is on the door.	Wo din wɔ ɔpon no so.
Except maybe one thing, he says.	Ɔka sɛ, gye sɛ ebia ade biako.
It was quite true that he painted like a child.	Na ɛyɛ nokware koraa sɛ ɔyɛɛ mfonini te sɛ abofra.
It was very true.	Ná ɛyɛ nokware paa.
Working at the desk.	Adwuma a wɔyɛ wɔ pon so.
This in itself may seem like an easy task.	Ebia eyi ankasa bɛyɛ te sɛ adwuma a ɛnyɛ den.
I understand from hand to mouth.	Mete ase fi nsa kosi ano.
He did both well.	Ɔyɛɛ abien no nyinaa yiye.
He slammed it on the table.	Ɔde bɔɔ pon no so.
There is no need to talk about it.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wobɛka ho asɛm.
Turn to him.	Dan kɔ ne nkyɛn.
It’s not too bad.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne dodo.
His speech followed mine.	Ne kasa no dii me de no akyi.
They took the literature to their car.	Wɔde nhoma ahorow no kɔɔ wɔn kar no mu.
He was good at it too.	Ná ɔno nso ho akokwaw wɔ mu.
They took advantage of the opportunity.	Wɔde hokwan no dii dwuma yiye.
Two would have been better, but one will do.	Anka abien bɛyɛ papa, nanso biako bɛyɛ.
I made you stronger.	Mede wo ho yɛɛ den.
Try both to see what you want.	Bɔ mmɔden abien no nyinaa hwɛ nea wopɛ.
Check it out now.	Hwɛ no mprempren.
It’s going to be.	Ɛrekɔ so.
If your song likes it, it probably exists.	Sɛ wo dwom no ani gye ho a, ebia ɛwɔ hɔ.
After about two hours.	Wɔ bɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abien akyi.
Their food is simple and cheap.	Wɔn aduan yɛ mmerɛw na ne bo nyɛ den.
I felt pretty good about this.	Metee nka sɛ m’ani agye yiye wɔ eyi ho.
This is not a moment in the present case.	Eyi nyɛ bere tiaa bi wɔ mprempren asɛm no mu.
The boy looked up at her.	Abarimaa no maa n’ani so hwɛɛ no.
He put his hand on his head and walked out.	Ɔde ne nsa too ne ti so fii adi.
The children go to school.	Mmofra no kɔ sukuu.
You have been absolutely amazing.	Woayɛ nwonwa koraa.
Say what you want about it.	Ka nea wopɛ wɔ ho.
You don’t want comments.	Wompɛ nsɛm a wɔka fa ho.
Don’t get into any trouble.	Mma nkɔ ɔhaw biara mu.
I saw a gun in the street.	Mihuu tuo bi wɔ abɔnten so.
They love it here.	Wɔn ani gye ho wɔ ha.
In amazing condition, the faces are in great shape.	Wɔ tebea a ɛyɛ nwonwa mu no, anim ahorow no wɔ tebea kɛse mu.
That’s the only number that matters to me.	Ɛno nkutoo ne dodow a ɛho hia me.
My dad starts talking about music.	Me papa fi ase ka nnwom ho asɛm.
It is not enough to be the content of the mind.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nsɛm a ɛwɔ adwene no mu.
No food but what you see.	Aduan biara nni hɔ gye nea wuhu.
You can see it in the table below.	Wubetumi ahu no wɔ pon a ɛwɔ ase ha no so.
His head raised his head.	Ne ti maa ne ti so.
Not as important.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛho hia no.
I was barely home.	Ná meyɛ fie kakraa bi.
There was nothing he could do for her.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ ama no.
I want to know what it is.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛyɛ.
Maybe there really is something here.	Ebia na biribi wɔ ha ankasa.
My mind runs wild.	M’adwene tu mmirika kɛse.
But his home is never his home.	Nanso ne fie nyɛ ne fie da.
They are my friends.	Wɔyɛ me nnamfo.
He was quite young.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
It doesn’t work.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma.
First of all.	Nea edi kan koraa.
It is very good indeed.	Eye paa ampa.
I had done what he wanted.	Ná mayɛ nea ɔpɛ no.
Two of the three were identical.	Ná abiɛsa no mu baanu yɛ pɛ.
It was one of the reasons he loved it so much.	Na ɛyɛ ade biako nti a na n’ani gye ho kɛse no.
The more you know, the more opportunities seem to present themselves.	Dodow a wunim no, dodow no ara na ɛte sɛ nea hokwan ahorow pii ba.
He slammed his hand on the table.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ pon no so.
There were a variety of things to play with.	Ná nneɛma ahorow bi wɔ hɔ a wɔde di agoru.
It seems more expensive than it is.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne bo yɛ den sen sɛnea ɛte.
That is certainly possible.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye.
Maybe we can help each other.	Ebia yebetumi aboa yɛn ho yɛn ho.
You can handle them.	Wubetumi adi wɔn ho dwuma.
It’s definitely going to be a fun evening.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛbɛyɛ anwummere a ɛyɛ anigye.
This project has been going on for years.	Saa adwuma yi rekɔ so mfe pii.
And I can’t do it.	Na mintumi nyɛ.
It’s a simple one.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Once upon a time.	Bere bi.
I'm still figuring it out.	Meda so ara reyɛ m’adwene wɔ ho.
You can talk about it if you want.	Wubetumi aka ho asɛm sɛ wopɛ a.
I can’t do it.	Mintumi nyɛ.
I didn’t know.	Ná minnim.
I can tell she is very attractive.	Metumi ahu sɛ ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Hopefully we can get some of those pictures.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ yebetumi anya saa mfonini ahorow bi.
But you both have to excuse me now.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ mo baanu nyinaa yi me kyɛw mprempren.
I have two of them.	Mewɔ abien.
Even that has taken two days.	Ɛno mpo agye nna abien.
How do you make paper at home?	Wobɛyɛ dɛn ayɛ krataa wɔ fie?
For the most part, this is not true.	Wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu no, eyi nyɛ nokware.
I had to tell someone, anyone.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ obi, obiara.
But we work all over the city.	Nanso yɛyɛ adwuma wɔ kurow no mu nyinaa.
This time, it isn’t.	Saa bere yi de, ɛnyɛ saa.
Not much he wants here.	Ɛnyɛ pii a ɔpɛ wɔ ha.
The danger was over.	Ná asiane no aba awiei.
The party was packed.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ apontow no ase.
Sounds great to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ kɛse ma me.
It’s this story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm yi.
They are perfect.	Wɔyɛ pɛ.
I’m glad he’ll be there with me.	M’ani agye sɛ ɔne me bɛba hɔ.
That was just too scary.	Ná ɛno yɛ hu dodo ara kwa.
But not like you.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛ wo.
There was no one inside.	Ná obiara nni hɔ a ɔte mu.
He may not be busy.	Ebia onni adagyew.
He wanted to do something.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
Let language be language and language be just that, language.	Ma kasa nyɛ kasa na kasa nyɛ saa ara, kasa.
Ti prices are falling.	Ti bo rekɔ fam.
The gun went off.	Tuo no bɔɔ.
I would like to know more about this.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu eyi ho nsɛm pii.
However, that is not the issue here.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no wɔ ha.
I think it would be a very good thing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ ade pa ara.
She loves to go outside.	N’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛkɔ abɔnten.
What do you want to see happen.	Dɛn na wopɛ sɛ wuhu sɛ ɛrekɔ so.
But you, first.	Nanso wo de, edi kan.
We cannot see most of our people.	Yɛrentumi nhu yɛn nkurɔfo dodow no ara.
Currently, his wife is gone.	Mprempren, ne yere nni hɔ.
I want to do the same.	Me nso mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
In their cars.	Wɔ wɔn kar ahorow mu.
In the end it didn’t matter.	Awiei koraa no na ɛnyɛ hwee.
I need to know everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu biribiara.
It doesn’t matter if a lot says it.	Sɛ pii ka a, ɛnyɛ hwee.
It’s pretty cool, isn’t it?	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye, ɛnte saa?
There is a road ahead.	Ɔkwan bi wɔ yɛn anim.
Why are you here?	Dɛn nti na wowɔ ha?
They were used to it too.	Ná wɔn nso ayɛ wɔn su.
But for now, it will be you.	Nanso seesei de, ɛbɛyɛ wo.
But he plays bigger than his measurements are.	Nanso ɔbɔ kɛse sen nea ne susuw yɛ.
We should have done that.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Maybe that’s true.	Ebia ɛno yɛ nokware.
What happened happened.	Nea esii no sii.
That’s the beauty of our photos.	Ɛno ne yɛn mfonini ahorow no fɛ.
We put him on the bed.	Yɛde no too mpa so.
Everything will even work itself out in the end.	Biribiara bɛkɔ ne ho mpo wɔ awiei koraa no.
He had no idea what to say.	Ná onni nea ɔbɛka ho adwene biara.
Big trouble, he seemed.	Ɔhaw kɛse, na ɔte sɛ nea ɛte.
Hopefully you can’t see it.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ worentumi nhu.
Just wear one.	Hyɛ biako kɛkɛ.
I want to prove myself.	Mepɛ sɛ meda me ho adi.
He signed his name at the bottom.	Ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ ne din ase wɔ ase hɔ.
The house was in beautiful condition.	Ná ofie no wɔ tebea a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Use it as you wish.	Fa di dwuma sɛnea wopɛ.
There was something about him, something .	Ná biribi wɔ ne ho, biribi .
For a short time.	Bere tiaa bi.
If you did a good job, he would tell you.	Sɛ woyɛ adwuma pa a, na ɔbɛka akyerɛ wo.
He has a happy disposition.	Ɔwɔ anigye su.
Are you with us?.	So wo ne yɛn wɔ hɔ?.
And we do this every year.	Na yɛyɛ eyi afe biara.
Don’t feel anything.	Mma wo nte biribiara nka.
I can only work with one hand at a time.	Metumi de nsa biako pɛ ayɛ adwuma bere koro mu.
One of his legs was missing.	Ná ne nan biako nni hɔ.
We followed it with our eyes.	Yɛde yɛn ani dii akyi.
But there are better things to do.	Nanso nneɛma a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
They welcomed each other with joy.	Wɔde anigye gyee wɔn ho wɔn ho.
But we do exist.	Nanso yɛwɔ hɔ ampa.
It’s perfect.	Ɛyɛ pɛ.
It was not hot by any means.	Ná ɛnyɛ hyew ɔkwan biara so.
This time, there was no hope.	Saa bere yi de, na anidaso biara nni hɔ.
I am sure this will seem like the great opportunity for him.	Migye di sɛ eyi bɛyɛ te sɛ hokwan kɛse no ama no.
I spent a couple of hours telling a story.	Mede nnɔnhwerew abien bi kaa asɛm bi.
Someone had expected it.	Ná obi ahwɛ kwan.
I'm involved with you.	Me ne wo de me ho ahyɛ mu.
These people have jobs.	Saa nkurɔfo yi wɔ nnwuma.
However, beautiful backgrounds make up for this.	Nanso, akyi mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ eyi.
But it was there.	Nanso na ɛwɔ hɔ.
It usually goes away on its own.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛno ankasa kɔ.
There are many factors.	Nneɛma pii na ɛwɔ hɔ.
You have to use the whole hair.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode ti nhwi no nyinaa di dwuma.
No one can get out of there.	Obiara ntumi mfi hɔ.
We are good friends.	Yɛyɛ nnamfo pa.
The bed is really very comfortable.	Mpa no yɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
It works the other way as well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ɔkwan foforo so nso.
That nothing we do means anything.	Sɛ biribiara a yɛyɛ no nkyerɛ hwee.
It’s really quite simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa ankasa.
But there should be no mistake.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ mfomso bi ba.
You know it now.	Wunim no mprempren.
But you risked it all for it.	Nanso wode ne nyinaa too asiane mu maa ɛno.
How is it located?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na ɛwɔ?
And that’s how it should be.	Na saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
They work for us.	Wɔyɛ adwuma ma yɛn.
He has the best way.	Ɔwɔ ɔkwan a eye sen biara no.
He could get involved.	Ná obetumi de ne ho ahyɛ mu.
I thought that was pretty cool.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno yɛ fɛ yiye.
This no longer seems to be the case.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi nte saa bio.
It was too soon.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo.
Look at their faces.	Hwɛ wɔn anim.
However, it has been a lot of fun.	Nanso, ayɛ anigye pii.
But most of them.	Nanso wɔn mu dodow no ara.
That was really good stuff.	Ná ɛno yɛ nneɛma pa ankasa.
It’s easy to touch.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wode wo nsa bɛka.
Not now, certainly.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren, akyinnye biara nni ho.
He is on the street.	Ɔwɔ abɔnten so.
There was none of that here.	Ná ɛno mu biara nni ha.
Nor should they be.	Saa ara nso na ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I wanted to tell her that, for me.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka saa kyerɛ no, ma me.
Whether it is or not.	Sɛ́ ɛyɛ anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
They are filled with information.	Wɔde nsɛm ahyɛ mu ma.
He played with it.	Ɔde bɔɔ ho agoru.
He was a great help.	Ná ɔyɛ mmoa kɛse.
We actually do that.	Yɛyɛ saa ankasa.
I think we can get some good results.	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi anya nneɛma pa bi afi mu aba.
He nodded towards the empty house.	Ɔde ne ti too fam kyerɛɛ ofie a hwee nni mu no.
Many such things.	Nneɛma pii a ɛte saa.
Our business is in a critical state.	Yɛn adwuma no wɔ tebea a ɛho hia mu.
You have done a good job here.	Woayɛ adwuma pa wɔ ha.
So does everyone else.	Saa ara na obiara nso yɛ.
There was no one on the street, except for two police officers.	Ná obiara nni abɔnten so, gye polisifo baanu nkutoo.
If he did, it worked.	Sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa a, na ɛyɛ adwuma.
The child cannot do that.	Abofra no ntumi nyɛ saa.
I put it aside.	Mede too nkyɛn.
The situation is obviously real.	Ɛda adi sɛ tebea no yɛ nokware.
He needs to come up with a better idea.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde adwene a eye sen saa ba.
It was a very interesting film.	Ná ɛyɛ sini a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
Naturally he had no desire to go.	Sɛnea ɛte no na onni ɔpɛ biara sɛ ɔbɛkɔ.
You will be among the first.	Wobɛka biako a edi kan no ho.
Too many people.	Nnipa pii dodo.
But that’s another story, and another document.	Nanso ɛno de, ɛyɛ asɛm foforo, ne krataa foforo.
The follow-up period was short.	Ná bere a wɔde dii akyi no yɛ tiaa.
He is doing it to show off to his friends.	Ɔreyɛ saa de akyerɛ ne nnamfo.
It’s not supposed to be, but it is.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ, nanso saa na ɛte.
Music was very important to me too.	Ná nnwom ho hia me nso yiye.
I know that and you know that.	Minim saa na wo nso wunim saa.
Everyone was shocked.	Obiara ho dwiriw no.
It was too weird.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa dodo.
It has to be the other way around.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔkwan foforo so.
They were happy in the city.	Ná wɔn ani gye wɔ kurow no mu.
However, they have poor eyesight.	Nanso, wɔn ani nhu ade yiye.
They are very fast.	Wɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm yiye.
This is a lot of money.	Eyi yɛ sika kɛse.
I want my son to be happy.	Mepɛ sɛ me ba no ani gye.
However, the school was new.	Nanso, na sukuu no yɛ foforo.
All the fun, none of the danger.	Anigye no nyinaa, asiane no mu biara nni hɔ.
But this is a first.	Nanso eyi yɛ nea edi kan.
There is no one.	Obiara nni hɔ.
But it never is.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa da.
I'll take you to your car.	Mede wo bɛkɔ wo kar no mu.
The same ones, over and over again.	Wɔn koro no ara, mpɛn pii.
The police are always watching him.	Polisifo no hwɛ no bere nyinaa.
I know we do that.	Minim sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
He wants to do the half thing.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fã no.
The police knew him well.	Ná polisifo nim no yiye.
It’s just way, way better than anything else.	Ɛyɛ ɔkwan, ɔkwan a eye sen biribi foforo biara kɛkɛ.
The scenery was spectacular.	Ná nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ nwonwa.
He is not important here.	Ɔnyɛ nea ɛho hia wɔ ha.
Can you please check if I am human?	Mesrɛ wo, wubetumi ahwɛ sɛ meyɛ onipa anaa?
Make this path clear.	Ma ɔkwan yi mu nna hɔ.
Now the classes are about to start.	Seesei adesua ahorow no reyɛ afi ase.
There has to be a better way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ.
Most don’t even notice.	Dodow no ara nhu mpo.
It’s just great overall.	Ɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa wɔ ne nyinaa mu.
You have to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Part of him knew it was over.	Ná ne fã bi nim sɛ aba awiei.
He definitely had our evening date in mind.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na n’adwene wɔ yɛn anwummere da no so.
And it all surprised me.	Na ne nyinaa maa me ho dwiriw me.
He had to hear what they said.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte nea wɔka no.
This can be many different things.	Eyi betumi ayɛ nneɛma ahorow pii.
But things went well.	Nanso nneɛma kɔɔ yiye.
You knew him.	Ná wunim no.
Maybe it wasn’t him.	Ebia na ɛnyɛ ɔno.
They make a lot of money though.	Wɔyɛ sika pii de, nanso.
In that sense of the word.	Wɔ saa kwan no so.
He does it for you.	Ɔyɛ ma wo.
The deadline has passed.	Bere a wɔde ama no atwam.
We have all made mistakes.	Yɛn nyinaa adi mfomso.
I was as shocked as anyone.	Me ho dwiriw me te sɛ obiara.
A man of few words.	Ɔbarima a ɔka nsɛm kakraa bi.
But it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛte saa.
The best of the best.	Nea eye paa.
It’s more perfect.	Ɛyɛ pɛ kɛse.
He told himself this was a game.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ eyi yɛ agoru.
It was the last day of the year.	Ná ɛyɛ afe no mu da a etwa to.
And the rest of your money.	Na wo sika a aka no nso.
I’m too excited.	M’ani agye dodo.
When, her mother says she has a girl for her.	Bere a, ne maame se ɔwɔ abeawa ma no.
It’s a dangerous thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a asiane wom.
He knew what to do.	Ná onim nea ɔbɛyɛ.
It’s been a long day.	Ɛyɛ da tenten bi.
We both knew why.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa nim nea enti a ɛte saa.
This is a bit of the same.	Eyi yɛ ade koro no ara kakra.
He gives this to his father and mother.	Ɔde eyi ma ne papa ne ne maame.
I want to talk about it.	Mepɛ sɛ meka ho asɛm.
If you want to sign books.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ wode wo nsa hyɛ nhoma ase a.
Most people understand this.	Nnipa dodow no ara te eyi ase.
Apparently neither does he.	Ɛda adi sɛ saa ara nso na ɔnyɛ saa.
The wool is used for clothing and leather.	Wɔde aboa nhoma no yɛ ntade ne aboa nhoma.
But he didn't want to play this game with her.	Nanso na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔne no di agoru yi.
Just enjoy where you are and keep at it.	Fa w’ani gye baabi a wowɔ no ho kɛkɛ na kɔ so yɛ saa.
Take a moment here.	Fa bere tiaa bi wɔ ha.
That’s the only reason he’s here.	Ɛno nkutoo nti na ɔwɔ ha.
I have had both for years.	Mewɔ abien no nyinaa mfe pii ni.
Innovation is risky.	Nneɛma foforo a wɔyɛ no yɛ asiane.
Children love him.	Mmofra ani gye ne ho.
And something else.	Na ade foforo nso.
It’s not a good idea.	Ɛnyɛ adwene pa.
He didn't have that last year.	Ná onni saa afe a etwaam no.
He was there.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ.
Mostly the money.	Dodow no ara yɛ sika no.
This is very true.	Eyi yɛ nokware paa.
I feel for him.	Mete nka ma no.
They are told things.	Wɔka nneɛma kyerɛ wɔn.
It was a new city.	Ná ɛyɛ kurow foforo.
They are much happier now.	Wɔn ani agye kɛse mprempren.
Signed on the back.	Wɔde wɔn nsa ahyɛ ase wɔ akyi.
Water is also a filler.	Nsu nso yɛ ade a wɔde hyɛ mu.
Her eyes were beautiful and she was very beautiful.	Ná n’ani yɛ fɛ na na ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Enjoy it, enjoy it.	Ma ho ani gye ho, di ho anigye.
I can’t do that.	Mintumi nyɛ saa.
Just as he had planned.	Sɛnea na wayɛ ho nhyehyɛe no.
We can all do that.	Yɛn nyinaa betumi ayɛ saa.
You can see for me.	Wubetumi ahu ama me.
Check out any of these products today!.	Hwɛ saa nneɛma yi mu biara nnɛ!.
I want to sleep well at night.	Mepɛ sɛ meda yiye anadwo.
Something else is needed.	Biribi foforo ho hia.
It’s the best day ever.	Ɛyɛ da a eye sen biara.
I don’t like that at all.	M’ani nnye saa asɛm no ho koraa.
It has to be good right?.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ papa ɛnte saa?.
I think this is a good idea.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ adwene pa.
He seemed happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
That night, something strange happened.	Anadwo no, ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii.
I want to see how they cooperate though.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea wɔyɛ biako de, nanso.
Entire.	Ne nyinaa.
Make sure all ingredients are at room temperature.	Hwɛ hu sɛ nneɛma a wode bɛyɛ aduan no nyinaa wɔ dan mu hyew mu.
Or maybe not at all.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
Who has done this?	Hena na wayɛ eyi?
But you can do it.	Nanso wubetumi ayɛ.
I was taken away.	Wɔde me faa no.
I did, he told himself.	Meyɛɛ saa, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho.
He kicked the door shut.	Ɔde ne nan bɔɔ ɔpon no mu.
You have done very well.	Woayɛ no yiye paa.
I can’t help him.	Mintumi mmoa no.
This situation was not new.	Ná nneɛma tebea yi nyɛ ade foforo.
The void did not exist.	Ná baabi a hwee nni hɔ no nni hɔ.
It’s because it works.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma nti.
And it was, a lot.	Na ɛte saa, pii.
Which is good for me and them.	Nea eye ma me ne wo.
This happened a lot.	Eyi sii pii.
Even if you don’t.	Sɛ mpo wonyɛ saa a.
The way you can be afraid.	Ɔkwan a wubetumi abɔ hu no.
Most people willingly do what they are told.	Nnipa dodow no ara fi wɔn pɛ mu yɛ nea wɔka kyerɛ wɔn no.
I couldn’t do that.	Ná mintumi nyɛ saa.
Everything has worked great.	Biribiara ayɛ adwuma kɛse.
You were too young to know about it.	Ná woyɛ abofra dodo sɛ wunnim ho hwee.
I don’t know most of those people.	Minnim saa nnipa no mu dodow no ara.
Next comes the story.	Nea edi hɔ ne asɛm no.
He loves the game of the game.	N’ani gye agoru a wɔde di agoru no ho.
That’s what I do, too.	Saa ara na me nso meyɛ.
Now everyone does that.	Seesei obiara yɛ saa.
Here's what he says.	Nea ɔka ni.
There are a variety of animals.	Mmoa ahorow ahorow te hɔ.
Full power was certainly exciting.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na tumi a edi mũ yɛ anigye.
He was everything to me.	Ná ɔyɛ biribiara ma me.
I love the pictures so much.	M’ani gye mfonini ahorow no ho kɛse.
It all started here.	Ne nyinaa fii ase wɔ ha.
There is another movie.	Sini foforo bi wɔ hɔ.
Only two of his books have survived.	Ne nhoma ahorow no mu abien pɛ na ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
One might paraphrase this.	Ebia obi bɛka eyi wɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
The street was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ abɔnten hɔ ma.
That seems painful.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ yaw.
There is no repetition.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ no mpɛn pii biara nni hɔ.
Water should be used freely.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde nsu di dwuma kwa.
It didn’t matter to him.	Ná ɛnyɛ hwee mma no.
If you are with your friends.	Sɛ wo ne wo nnamfo wɔ hɔ a.
There is nothing any of you can do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a mo mu biara betumi ayɛ.
A temporary offer.	Bere tiaa bi a wɔde ma.
I want to do the below.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nea ɛwɔ ase ha yi.
It wasn’t difficult.	Ná ɛnyɛ den.
He did two things.	Ɔyɛɛ nneɛma abien.
His mother puts him in danger again.	Ne maame de no kɔ asiane mu bio.
All but one such person.	Ne nyinaa gye onipa biako a ɛte saa.
Or in the industry.	Anaasɛ wɔ nnwuma mu.
It’s just part of the game.	Ɛyɛ agoru no fã bi kɛkɛ.
A man of such a character.	Ɔbarima a ɔte saa.
And here little remains to be done.	Na ha no, kakraa bi na aka a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I’m glad no one saw that.	M’ani agye sɛ obiara anhu saa.
This was too easy.	Ná eyi yɛ mmerɛw dodo.
Take me to him.	Fa me kɔ ne nkyɛn.
He spent some pretty sluggish hours.	Ɔde nnɔnhwerew bi a ɛyɛ fɛ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yɛɛ adwuma.
It’s wonderful, it’s wonderful.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa, ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Or the first one.	Anaasɛ nea edi kan no.
Basically.	Ɛno ara ne sɛ.
I didn’t really want to know.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu ankasa.
And I can’t tell you why.	Na mintumi nka nea enti a ɛte saa nkyerɛ wo.
You can’t take that into your speeches.	Worentumi mfa saa asɛm no nkɔ wo kasa ahorow mu.
You can’t win.	Worentumi nni nkonim.
They are both wonderful.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ nwonwa.
We will work on these things throughout the book.	Yɛbɛyɛ saa nneɛma yi ho adwuma wɔ nhoma no nyinaa mu.
I just didn’t want to be touched.	Nea na mempɛ ara ne sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa bɛka me.
Apply the next day.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu da a edi hɔ no.
I can’t help him.	Mintumi mmoa no.
And that surprises me.	Na ɛno ma me ho dwiriw me.
So good things.	So nneɛma pa.
That we.	Sɛ́ yɛn...
You will feel much better when it is over.	Wo ho bɛtɔ wo kɛse bere a aba awiei no.
Whether it’s a party or not.	Sɛ́ ɛyɛ apontow bi anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
I want to work with you.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo yɛ adwuma.
That was too simplistic.	Ná ɛno yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
Something important had happened.	Ná biribi a ɛho hia aba.
This is very simple.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
It’s not us.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn.
The story was not always going to end there.	Ná ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na asɛm no bɛba awiei wɔ hɔ.
That’s a monster!	Ɛno yɛ aboa kɛse!
He gave you one if you wanted it.	Ɔde biako maa wo sɛ wopɛ a.
There is no problem either.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ nso.
So, the timing is important, too.	Enti, bere no ho hia, nso.
Not so much here, though.	Ɛnyɛ saa pii wɔ ha, nanso.
They are used as food.	Wɔde di dwuma sɛ aduan.
Nor does he do that.	Saa ara nso na ɔnyɛ saa.
He knew about these things, a little anyway.	Ná onim saa nneɛma yi ho asɛm, kakra sɛnea ɛte biara.
It’s his son.	Ɛyɛ ne ba no.
But that’s the name of the game.	Nanso ɛno ne agoru no din.
It was a beautiful morning, fresh and new.	Ná ɛyɛ anɔpa a ɛyɛ fɛ, a ɛyɛ foforo na ɛyɛ foforo.
One thing going for another.	Ade biako a ɛrekɔ so de ayɛ ade foforo.
There was another thing he had to do first.	Ade foforo nso wɔ hɔ a na ɛsɛ sɛ odi kan yɛ.
But you have to know.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
That may sound strange.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
And we had to do that.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
But this may have been a mistake.	Nanso ebia na eyi yɛ mfomso.
I think, give it some more time.	Misusuw sɛ, ma no bere kakra bio.
And the other half.	Na fã a aka no nso.
And he liked the idea.	Na n’ani gyee adwene no ho.
Just go to work.	Kɔ adwuma kɛkɛ.
You know how and why this happens.	Wunim sɛnea eyi ba ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
I’d love to do that.	M’ani begye sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
At least they gave him that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔde saa asɛm no maa no.
He spent most of his time at the window.	Ná ɔde ne bere fã kɛse no ara tra mfɛnsere ho.
Don’t let it defeat you.	Mma ɛnyɛ wo so nkonim.
You can’t sleep.	Worentumi nna.
We can solve this problem with this method.	Yebetumi de saa kwan yi adi ɔhaw yi ho dwuma.
No one says anything.	Obiara nka asɛm biara.
So, a lot of it.	Enti, pii.
The night was clear but cold.	Ná anadwo no mu da hɔ nanso na awɔw wom.
But for now, be alone and sleep for a while.	Nanso seesei de, wo ho wo ho na da kakra.
He is truly the man for all mankind.	Ɔno ne onipa a ɔyɛ ma nnipa nyinaa ampa.
And in many cases it was.	Na wɔ nsɛm pii mu no, na ɛte saa.
The plan was in progress.	Ná nhyehyɛe no rekɔ so.
She was such an innocent person.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho nni asɛm saa.
Not even his mother.	Ɛnyɛ ne maame mpo.
It would be much more interesting now than it was then.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ anigye kɛse mprempren sen sɛnea na ɛte saa bere no.
Working on a great project using this now.	Adwuma kɛse bi a wɔde eyi di dwuma mprempren ho adwuma.
She seemed beautiful.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani gyee ho saa.
But it’s still not the same.	Nanso ɛda so ara nyɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
He quickly ran out the door.	Ɔde mmirika faa ɔpon no mu fii adi ntɛmntɛm.
I am new to most of this.	Meyɛ foforo wɔ eyi mu dodow no ara ho.
I slipped into myself.	Mede me ho bɔɔ me.
And yet, many continue to do so.	Na nanso, nnipa pii kɔ so yɛ saa.
If he knows what not to do, he should tell us.	Sɛ onim nea ɔnyɛ a, ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ yɛn.
Every city has them.	Kurow biara wɔ wɔn.
I was part of a group.	Ná meka kuw bi ho.
It’s a very simple statement.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
The reason for this is very simple.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Someone else with him.	Obi foforo a ɔka ne ho.
We had it before, and we can have it again.	Ná yɛwɔ bi pɛn, na yebetumi anya bi bio.
At least you have a job.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wowɔ adwuma.
He had a chance.	Ná ɔwɔ hokwan bi.
Certainly not the first team.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ kuw a edi kan.
No more words, now is the time to act.	Nsɛm biara nni hɔ bio, mprempren ne bere a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi.
I am one of the people.	Meyɛ nnipa no mu biako.
This is actually pretty simple.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye ankasa.
Maybe more.	Ebia pii.
And he knew why.	Na onim nea enti a ɛte saa.
It was a really scary time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ hu ankasa.
He just made me the night.	Ɔyɛɛ me anadwo no ara kwa.
We offer something new every month.	Yɛde biribi foforo ma ɔsram biara.
It was not cheap.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den.
Perhaps time got the better of them.	Ebia bere no nyaa wɔn so nkonim.
He didn't have to do that.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
The team has already addressed that.	Kuw no adi saa asɛm no ho dwuma dedaw.
This is all I will add.	Eyi nkutoo na mede bɛka ho.
It was an amazing week.	Ná ɛyɛ dapɛn a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I was too good for any one man.	Ná meyɛ papa dodo ma ɔbarima biako biara.
However, most people don’t get this right.	Nanso, nnipa dodow no ara ntumi nnya eyi yiye.
Maybe two or three.	Ebia abien anaa abiɛsa.
He needs to hear the truth.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte nokware no.
Why isn’t he so happy?	Dɛn nti na n’ani nnye saa?
No doubt he knew.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na onim.
It obviously has something going on.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛwɔ biribi a ɛrekɔ so.
Not these things.	Ɛnyɛ saa nneɛma yi.
I had no books.	Ná minni nhoma biara.
You will be working independently.	Wobɛyɛ adwuma a wode wo ho.
However, I was concerned about something.	Nanso, na biribi haw me wɔ ho.
And that he has nothing to offer me.	Na sɛ onni biribiara a ɔde bɛma me.
He was such a guy.	Ná ɔte saa.
More animals than man.	Mmoa pii sen onipa.
But it’s fun.	Nanso ɛyɛ anigye.
Maybe someone will save him.	Ebia obi begye no nkwa.
Part of me is not with me, never with me.	Me fã bi nka me ho, nka me ho da.
We had time.	Ná yɛwɔ bere.
This is usually not a problem when creating windows.	Eyi taa nyɛ ɔhaw bere a woreyɛ mfɛnsere no.
You are a good man.	Woyɛ ɔbarima pa.
He settled the words for a moment.	Ɔde nsɛm no sii gyinae kakra.
The dress was amazing.	Ná atade no yɛ nwonwa.
I will add that capability later this week.	Mede saa tumi no bɛka ho akyiri yi dapɛn yi.
It’s not too late.	Ɛnyɛ nea aka akyi dodo.
Thus, the narrative follows.	Enti, asɛm a wɔka no di akyi.
Give it to me.	Ma no me.
Try again.	Bɔ mmɔden bio.
But both happened.	Nanso abien no nyinaa sii.
People have brought him.	Nkurɔfo de no aba.
The shark went back into the water.	Ɔkraman no san kɔɔ nsu no mu.
I feel so badly hurt.	Mete nka sɛ me ho ayɛ me yaw kɛse.
That has worked well for him.	Ɛno ayɛ adwuma yiye ama no.
Thank you so much for your candid comments.	Meda mo ase pii wɔ mo nsɛm a ɛyɛ nokware no ho.
I heard the first thing each of them said.	Metee asɛm a edi kan a wɔn mu biara kae no.
A little bit of it.	Kakraa bi.
They didn’t have to say the words.	Na enhia sɛ wɔka nsɛm no.
One of the prices.	Bo no mu biako.
I'm working on that too.	Me nso mereyɛ adwuma wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Thank you so much!.	Meda wo ase pii!.
Like, oneself.	Te sɛ, obi ankasa.
All we can do is do the best job we can.	Nea yebetumi ayɛ ara ne sɛ yɛbɛyɛ adwuma a eye sen biara a yebetumi.
You can see that.	Wubetumi ahu saa.
The dog kicked.	Ɔkraman no de ne nan bɔɔ nsu.
It was an interesting story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
Not this thing or that thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade yi anaa saa ade no.
He was filled with joy.	Anigye hyɛɛ no ​​ma.
There are plans to be made.	Nhyehyɛe ahorow wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I cry all home.	Me su nyinaa fie.
What projects did he work on?	Nnwuma bɛn na ɔyɛɛ ho adwuma?
Take your time about it.	Gye wo bere fa ho.
He wanted that very much.	Ná ɔpɛ saa paa.
He was not in our plans.	Ná onni yɛn nhyehyɛe ahorow no mu.
We were good friends this morning.	Ná yɛyɛ nnamfo pa anɔpa yi.
Their apartment is very nice.	Wɔn dan no yɛ fɛ yiye.
He has a lot of them.	Ɔwɔ wɔn pii.
He had no idea how he had worked this out.	Ná onni sɛnea wayɛ eyi ho adwuma no ho adwene biara.
You know, keep trying.	Wunim, kɔ so bɔ mmɔden.
However, it wasn’t.	Nanso, na ɛte saa.
So tell me about it.	Enti ka kyerɛ me.
It’s my car.	Ɛyɛ me kar.
Life is short, so you have to seize the day.	Nkwa yɛ tiaa, enti ɛsɛ sɛ wugye da no.
I want to do so many things.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nneɛma pii saa.
Finally, identify what you want to see.	Nea etwa to no, kyerɛ nea wopɛ sɛ wuhu.
But somehow that doesn’t matter.	Nanso wɔ ɔkwan bi so no, ɛno mfa ho.
Your last moment.	Wo bere a etwa to no.
None of them are there.	Wɔn mu biara nni hɔ.
Can we.	So yebetumi.
And add more to it.	Na fa pii ka ho.
He must be very popular.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho kɛse.
Everyone was really alert and engaged.	Ná obiara ani da hɔ ankasa na na ɔde ne ho ahyɛ mu.
No one saw him all that day.	Obiara anhu no saa da no nyinaa.
This is the end of it.	Eyi ne awiei no.
No one knew where it was.	Ná obiara nnim baabi a ɛwɔ.
I should have included that.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mede saa nsɛm no ka ho.
Thank me later.	Meda me ase akyiri yi.
It doesn’t always work, and it’s never something that’s complicated.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛyɛ adwuma, na ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ den da.
Something bad would have happened by now.	Anka biribi bɔne bi besi mprempren.
Door to door.	Ɔpon ano kɔ ɔpon ano.
As such, this strategy is not feasible in the long term.	Sɛnea ɛte no, saa ɔkwan yi ntumi nyɛ yiye wɔ bere tenten mu.
So be careful.	Enti hwɛ yiye.
And you are the only one.	Na wo nkutoo na wowɔ hɔ.
Too much to be unnecessary.	Ɛdɔɔso dodo sɛ ɛho nhia.
Nothing to do now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ mprempren.
The whole time.	Bere no nyinaa.
And one more thing.	Na ade biako bio nso.
Everything else is still in play.	Biribiara a aka no da so ara wɔ agoru mu.
We do the things that hurt.	Yɛyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ yaw no.
It’s harder than it needs to be.	Ɛyɛ den sen sɛnea ɛho hia.
I certainly did that for him for years.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ meyɛɛ saa maa no mfe pii.
This works well.	Eyi yɛ adwuma yiye.
I can use that in class.	Metumi de saa asɛm no adi dwuma wɔ adesua mu.
Both of them.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa.
There are too many people.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ dodo.
That’s all they do.	Ɛno ara ne nea wɔyɛ.
He may not know about you either.	Ebia ɔno nso nnim wo ho asɛm.
Or use it at home.	Anaasɛ fa di dwuma wɔ fie.
One powerful statement.	Asɛm biako a tumi wom.
However, the words did not come.	Nanso, nsɛm no amma.
His father was a bookmaker.	Ná ne papa yɛ obi a ɔyɛ nhoma.
Maybe it was a song.	Ebia na ɛyɛ dwom.
This was the house.	Ná eyi ne ofie no.
I was getting very weak.	Ná mereyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
He has trouble with the deadline.	Ɔwɔ ɔhaw wɔ bere a wɔde ama no ho.
Don’t do that!	Nyɛ saa!
They’re looking at me.	Wɔn ani da me so.
How much work would you do?	Adwuma dodow ahe na anka wobɛyɛ?
Nevertheless, problems remain.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɔhaw ahorow da so ara wɔ hɔ.
You do everything now.	Woyɛ biribiara mprempren.
This is our home.	Eyi ne yɛn fie.
School is important.	Sukuu ho hia.
There are actually a lot of people.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ ankasa.
His father said nothing to him.	Ne papa anka hwee ankyerɛ no.
This movie could be good.	Saa sini yi betumi ayɛ papa.
Tom is a great boy.	Tom yɛ abarimaa kɛse bi.
I'm going to be self-confident.	Mede me ho to me so.
It’s not really a bad thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade bɔne ankasa.
His foot is in the doorway.	Ne nan wɔ ɔpon no ano.
I know how these things work.	Minim sɛnea saa nneɛma yi yɛ adwuma.
Two years have passed.	Mfe abien atwam.
I could see most of that.	Ná metumi ahu saa dodow no ara.
But that doesn’t mean much.	Nanso ɛno nkyerɛ pii.
He had some things going on.	Ná ɔwɔ nneɛma bi a ɛrekɔ so.
He didn't quite know what he was doing.	Ná onnim nea ɔreyɛ no yiye.
He was indeed terrible.	Ná ne ho yɛ hu ampa.
He nodded to them.	Ɔde ne ti too fam kyerɛɛ wɔn.
It was going downhill.	Ná ɛrekɔ fam.
Not so long ago they were the same.	Ɛnyɛ bere tenten ni saa na na wɔyɛ ade koro.
For most, it still is today.	Wɔ dodow no ara fam no, ɛda so ara te saa nnɛ.
And we do it day and night.	Na yɛyɛ no awia ne anadwo.
Fortunately, this wasn’t one of those things.	Nea eye ne sɛ, na eyi nyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biako.
It all works just fine.	Ne nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye ara kwa.
Everything would be so wonderful.	Ná biribiara bɛyɛ nwonwa saa.
I feel normal again.	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ obi a ɔte ase bio.
I don’t want to give anything away.	Mempɛ sɛ mede biribiara bɛma.
In the lower part of it.	Wɔ ne fã a ɛwɔ fam no.
No one likes him, he is very unpopular.	Obiara mpɛ no, ɔyɛ obi a nkurɔfo mpɛ no koraa.
Everything.	Biribiara.
He wanted to overcome his fear.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ odi ne hu no so nkonim.
Wear warm clothes.	Hyɛ ntade a ɛyɛ hyew.
This can’t be just about you.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ wo nkutoo ho asɛm.
Go further now.	Kɔ akyiri mprempren.
I love it and I’m sure you will.	M’ani gye ho na migye di sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
But what do you think?.	Nanso dɛn na wususuw?.
My team was underperforming.	Ná me kuw no ntumi nyɛ adwuma yiye.
He knew there would be time for that.	Ná onim sɛ bere bɛba ama ɛno.
Nothing inside or outside, except mentally.	Biribiara nni mu anaa akyi, gye sɛ adwene mu.
There are things you can do, to make things better.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ, na ama nneɛma ayɛ yiye.
I loved the movie.	M’ani gyee sini no ho.
Structure and dynamics of liquid films on solid surfaces.	Nsu sini ahorow a ɛwɔ nneɛma a ɛyɛ den so no nhyehyɛe ne ne tumi.
I did a really good job.	Meyɛɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
This is a very good thing.	Eyi yɛ ade pa ara.
They are not interested in anything else.	Wɔn ani nnye biribi foforo biara ho.
The man worked on it.	Ɔbarima no yɛɛ ho adwuma.
Hands you can see, touch, prove.	Nsa a wubetumi ahu, wode wo nsa aka, akyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
In this case, there are other possibilities.	Wɔ eyi mu no, nneɛma foforo betumi aba.
This didn’t really work out very well.	Eyi ankɔ yiye koraa ankasa.
It’s a lot harder than people think, you know.	Ɛyɛ den kɛse sen sɛnea nkurɔfo susuw, wunim.
You are a good man.	Woyɛ ɔbarima pa.
You have been such a great idea, done so much work for me.	Woayɛ adwene kɛse saa, ayɛ adwuma pii ama me.
Also.	Nso.
I was amazed at how quickly he recovered.	Sɛnea ne ho tɔɔ no ntɛmntɛm no yɛɛ me nwonwa.
The animal	Aboa no
That may not surprise you.	Ebia ɛno nyɛ wo nwonwa.
I don’t have to believe it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ migye di.
I love hanging out with my friends.	M’ani gye ho sɛ me ne me nnamfo bɛbɔ.
But he can see you.	Nanso obetumi ahu wo.
We were not alone.	Ná ɛnyɛ yɛn nkutoo na na yɛwɔ.
I found the money on the floor.	Mihuu sika no wɔ fam hɔ.
However, this did not happen.	Nanso, eyi amma.
I think you can look at the results.	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi ahwɛ nea afi mu aba no.
I saw this.	Mihuu eyi.
He had them.	Ná ɔwɔ wɔn.
If a story sounds too perfect, question it.	Sɛ asɛm bi te sɛ nea edi mũ dodo a, gye ho kyim.
He does nothing most of the time.	Ɔnyɛ hwee mpɛn pii.
Apparently there are at least two.	Ɛda adi sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, abien na ɛwɔ hɔ.
He is truly an interesting man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a n’ani gye ho ampa.
Is this your car?	So eyi yɛ wo kar?
The house looks amazing.	Ofie no hwɛ yɛ nwonwa.
That’s why he seems so familiar.	Ɛno nti na ɛte sɛ nea onim no yiye no.
However, his presence does not always go unnoticed.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ne ba a ɔwɔ hɔ no kɔ so a obiara nhu.
We introduced him to everyone.	Yɛde no kyerɛɛ obiara.
We have this one.	Yɛwɔ eyi.
But that is not the case for most of us.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa wɔ yɛn mu dodow no ara fam.
There is nothing here for him.	Biribiara nni ha mma no.
I can’t get out of here.	Mintumi mfi ha.
Do you have anything to share?	So wowɔ biribi a wopɛ sɛ woka ho asɛm?
You always know where it is.	Wunim baabi a ɛwɔ bere nyinaa.
It looks really fun though.	Ɛte sɛ anigye ankasa de, nanso.
He was a very handsome man, very old.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye, na ne mfe akɔ anim yiye.
You are indeed very dangerous.	Woyɛ asiane kɛse ampa.
He really could.	Ná obetumi ankasa.
He gives me one.	Ɔde biako ma me.
You can watch it with your friends.	Wubetumi ne wo nnamfo ahwɛ.
The best option available in my opinion.	Ɔkwan a eye sen biara a ɛwɔ hɔ wɔ m’adwene mu.
That work begins today.	Saa adwuma no fi ase nnɛ.
I don’t want to hurt him.	Mempɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no yaw.
He always had to be strong and independent.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ den na ɔde ne ho bere nyinaa.
It is indeed the case.	Ɛte saa ampa.
Biology was becoming more and more abstract.	Ná nneɛma a nkwa wom reyɛ nea ɛnyɛ adwene kɛse.
She held the child in her arms.	Ɔde abofra no bɔɔ ne mu.
They are dangerous.	Wɔyɛ asiane.
Or their faces.	Anaasɛ wɔn anim.
Very nearly so.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte saa kɛse.
However, we would do it a little differently.	Nanso, anka yɛbɛyɛ no ɔkwan foforo so kakra.
I think this might help.	Misusuw sɛ eyi betumi aboa.
He had done so much for them tonight.	Ná wayɛ pii ama wɔn anadwo yi.
I would have immediately done otherwise.	Anka mɛyɛ ntɛm ara sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
However, it is no longer the case.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ saa bio.
That’s what it is.	Ɛno ne saa.
There are many uses for both types.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a wɔde di dwuma ma ahorow abien no nyinaa.
I know you have done some of those things.	Minim sɛ woayɛ saa nneɛma no bi.
I can find something else to do.	Metumi anya biribi foforo a mɛyɛ.
Maybe that didn’t matter.	Ebia na ɛno ho nhia.
He's doing well.	Ɔreyɛ yiye.
It’s an important game.	Ɛyɛ agoru a ɛho hia.
But that was the point.	Nanso na ɛno ne asɛm no.
I just want to go.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ ara kwa.
He spent too long with her.	Ɔne no dii bere tenten dodo.
So much for that approach.	Enti pii ma saa kwan no.
He wasn't in the back bedroom either.	Na onni akyi mpa no mu nso.
That hurt him.	Ɛno yɛɛ no ​​yaw.
Be sure to take water with you.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wode nsu bɛkɔ.
The present is still valid.	Mprempren no da so ara yɛ adwuma.
People have their own schedules.	Nkurɔfo wɔ wɔn ankasa bere nhyehyɛe.
Better spend your time elsewhere.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wode wo bere bɛkɔ baabi foforo.
Mine is the first one.	Me de no ne nea edi kan.
It is not my habit to do this.	Ɛnyɛ me su sɛ mɛyɛ eyi.
Everything you see is so expensive every week.	Biribiara a wuhu no bo yɛ den saa dapɛn biara.
No one else could see that.	Obi foforo biara antumi anhu saa.
He was a strong man.	Ná ne ho yɛ den.
Keep your eyes on him.	Ma w’ani nna ne so.
There is nothing on them.	Biribiara nni wɔn so.
They were soft enough.	Ná wɔyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
We have plenty of time yet until the first game.	Yɛwɔ bere pii de besi nnɛ kosi agoru a edi kan no.
At least it’s available.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ.
But tonight he wasn’t.	Nanso anadwo yi na ɔnyɛ saa.
His music was very popular.	Ná ne nnwom no ani gye ho paa.
The highway is often crowded.	Ɔkwan kɛse no so taa yɛ ma.
Naturally, there was nothing complicated about that.	Sɛnea ɛte no, na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ den wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
As in yours and mine.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ wo ne me de mu no.
At the end of the day it works.	Wɔ da no awiei no ɛyɛ adwuma.
This means he is doing something right.	Eyi kyerɛ sɛ ɔreyɛ biribi yiye.
But its great power.	Nanso ne tumi kɛse.
You are beautiful and powerful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ na wowɔ tumi.
She was very young and beautiful.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra koraa na na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
The latter is the band’s final highlight.	Nea etwa to no ne kuw no nnwom a etwa to a ɛyɛ anigye.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
I couldn’t do much with him.	Ná mintumi ne no nyɛ pii.
And a house, too.	Na ofie bi nso.
I'm in three games.	Mewɔ agoru abiɛsa mu.
It’s so cold outside!	Awɔw wom paa wɔ abɔnten!
I think it sounds awesome.	Misusuw sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
He is busy, busy, busy today.	Ɔwɔ adagyew, onni adagyew, onni adagyew nnɛ.
The food is amazing.	Aduan no yɛ nwonwa.
If it’s still too thick, do it again.	Sɛ ɛda so ara yɛ kɛse dodo a, yɛ bio.
He was also alert.	Ná ɔno nso ani da hɔ.
But that was one.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ biako.
That was a big deal.	Ná ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse.
So keep an eye on this.	Enti hwɛ eyi so yiye.
But the fun is just beginning.	Nanso anigye no afi ase ara kwa.
I need your help.	Mepɛ mo mmoa.
Expect this to take a few days.	Hwɛ kwan sɛ eyi begye nna kakraa bi.
We love beautiful clothes.	Yɛn ani gye ntade a ɛyɛ fɛ ho.
That was completely impossible.	Ná ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye koraa.
It’s really beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
No one can take them away.	Obiara ntumi mfa wɔn nkɔ.
I want to be a part of it.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ne fã.
This is the first case of its kind.	Eyi ne asɛm a edi kan a ɛte saa.
I'm not sure why this is happening.	Me ntumi nhu nea enti a eyi rekɔ so.
All packages must arrive by the end of the month.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma a wɔde ahyɛ mu no nyinaa ba ansa na ɔsram no aba awiei.
Long nights and weekends.	Anadwo tenten ne dapɛn awiei.
It has been a pleasure working with you.	Ayɛ anigye sɛ me ne mo reyɛ adwuma.
Our job was to do all this work.	Ná yɛn adwuma ne sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa adwuma yi nyinaa.
And I'm sorry for you.	Na mepa wo kyɛw.
We need to do something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ biribi.
Diversity and services matter.	Nneɛma ahorow ne nnwuma ahorow ho hia.
Or maybe it’s not good.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛnyɛ papa.
You’ve done it right.	Woayɛ no yiye.
I'm afraid.	Me suro.
This is important for two reasons.	Nneɛma abien nti na eyi ho hia.
But it’s a lot of fun.	Nanso ɛyɛ anigye pii.
That is what is set for us.	Ɛno na wɔde asi hɔ ama yɛn.
But in many and most cases, that doesn’t matter.	Nanso wɔ nsɛm pii ne dodow no ara mu no, ɛno ho nhia.
But he is not the same.	Nanso ɔnyɛ ade koro.
More this time around.	Pii saa bere yi.
And why not.	Na dɛn nti na ɛnte saa.
It’s kind of the trouble of being one.	Ɛyɛ ɔhaw a ɛwɔ sɛ wobɛyɛ bi no bi.
Maybe that’s what will work for you too.	Ebia ɛno ne nea ɛbɛyɛ adwuma ama wo nso.
She just doesn’t want a man.	Ɔmpɛ ɔbarima kɛkɛ.
This species is now endangered.	Mprempren saa mmoa yi wɔ asiane mu.
It wasn’t like a game anymore.	Na ɛnte sɛ agoru bi bio.
His money has taken his money.	Ne sika no agye ne sika.
Many people attend on the weekends.	Nnipa pii kɔ bi wɔ dapɛn awiei.
You had to be there, man.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ wowɔ hɔ, ɔbarima.
You are.	Woyɛ.
They have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
These arrangements.	Saa nhyehyɛe ahorow yi.
Water levels are likely to drop.	Ɛda adi sɛ nsu no mu dodow bɛkɔ fam.
He put it together over the summer.	Ɔde bɔɔ mu wɔ awɔw bere no mu.
People could see him now.	Ná nkurɔfo tumi hu no mprempren.
Or it has been given.	Anaasɛ wɔde ama.
It was not very important.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia kɛse.
We are very fond of them.	Yɛn ani gye wɔn ho paa.
It’s an idea.	Ɛyɛ adwene bi.
I have several of them.	Mewɔ wɔn mu dodow bi.
The production process continues.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ no kɔ so.
Everyone lived happily ever after.	Obiara traa ase anigye so.
At the same time, it was such a great year.	Bere koro no ara mu no, na ɛyɛ afe kɛse saa.
It would be nice to do the same.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ saa ara.
I can’t do anything else.	Mintumi nyɛ biribi foforo biara.
When she does some housework, she does it well.	Sɛ ɔyɛ ofie adwuma bi a, ɔyɛ no yiye.
I’m really enjoying this game.	M’ani agye saa agoru yi ho ankasa.
I don’t think you even want help.	Minsusuw sɛ wopɛ mmoa mpo.
I can't figure out what else I might use.	Mintumi nhu nea ebia mede bedi dwuma bio.
I have a lot to do today.	Mewɔ pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nnɛ.
I was already at dinner.	Ná mewɔ anwummere aduan ase dedaw.
That one day everything will actually work out.	Sɛ da bi biribiara bɛyɛ yiye ankasa.
The less these people know, the better.	Dodow a saa nkurɔfo yi nnim pii no, dodow no ara na eye.
Too busy pretending to be interested.	Adagyew dodo sɛ ɛbɛyɛ ne ho sɛ n’ani gye ho.
Nobody knows.	Obiara nnim.
I have been having trouble with this for a few days now.	Mewɔ ɔhaw mu wɔ eyi ho nna kakraa bi ni.
I thought about how much it would hurt.	Misusuw sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yaw kɛse no ho.
He lowered the gun.	Ɔde tuo no sii fam.
However, it wasn’t easy.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
Don’t take money from someone you don’t know.	Nnye sika mfi obi a wunnim no hɔ.
But there is one more interesting thing.	Nanso ade biako bio wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ anigye.
The situation didn’t matter to me.	Ná tebea no nyɛ asɛm mma me.
The story went on.	Asɛm no kɔɔ so.
Nothing about that should be surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno ho biribiara yɛ nwonwa.
It’s just me.	Ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
Surely that is what his father would have done.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ saa na anka ne papa bɛyɛ.
If you have a lot of money.	Sɛ wowɔ sika pii a.
Someone remembered me.	Obi kae me.
Only expensive brands will work.	Nneɛma a wɔde yɛ nneɛma a ne bo yɛ den nkutoo na ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
At this meeting, think again.	Wɔ saa nhyiam yi so no, susuw ho bio.
I don’t really like him.	M’ani nnye ne ho ankasa.
Therefore, the police must take action.	Enti, ɛsɛ sɛ polisifo no yɛ ho biribi.
There was still a problem.	Ná ɔhaw bi da so ara wɔ hɔ.
You can do so many things with it.	Wubetumi de ayɛ nneɛma pii saa.
This didn’t work either.	Eyi nso anyɛ adwuma.
The highway seemed endless.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔkwan kɛse no nni awiei.
They are expensive.	Wɔn bo yɛ den.
He is one great dad for one.	Ɔyɛ papa kɛse biako ma biako.
He brought his groceries to the town square.	Ɔde ne nneɛma a ɔde bɛtɔ nneɛma no baa kurow no abɔnten so.
There was simply nothing to do.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ara kwa.
Check it out here.	Hwɛ no wɔ ha.
Do them.	Yɛ wɔn.
Nothing else needed to be said anyway.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ wɔka biribi foforo biara ɔkwan biara so.
He had enjoyed his time in his bed.	Ná n’ani agye bere a ɔde traa ne mpa so no ho.
No one can really say.	Obiara ntumi nka ankasa.
It’s just one of those things.	Ɛyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biako pɛ.
Save me and save me.	Gye me na gye me nkwa.
It’s just that this story never works for me.	Ɛyɛ kɛkɛ sɛ saa asɛm yi nyɛ adwuma mma me da.
He knew something, but he didn't know exactly what it was.	Ná onim biribi, nanso na onnim nea ɛyɛ ankasa.
Usually, but not always.	Mpɛn pii no, nanso ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa.
I no longer have this problem.	Minni ɔhaw yi bio.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na eyi betumi aba.
He would do anything to get to her.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ biribiara de adu ne nkyɛn.
All the way home.	Ɔkwan no nyinaa so kɔɔ fie.
It has been incredible to work with him.	Ayɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ me ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
There was nothing remarkable about it.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ho.
He never knew our mother.	Onnim yɛn maame da.
Yours will be the same.	Wo de nso bɛyɛ saa.
No wonder most people don’t do this.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ nnipa dodow no ara nyɛ eyi.
It would be great if we had more.	Sɛ yɛwɔ pii a, anka ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
Why you should be there.	Nea enti a ɛsɛ sɛ wowɔ hɔ.
Another year at home.	Afe foforo a yɛde traa fie.
I can also show you something beautiful.	Metumi nso akyerɛ wo biribi a ɛyɛ fɛ.
You have to think of something else, or someone else.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw biribi foforo ho, anaa obi foforo.
He was completely alone.	Ná ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ koraa.
You don’t pretend otherwise.	Wonyɛ wo ho sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
And the idea remained with him for the rest of his life.	Na adwene no da so ara wɔ ne mu nkwa nna nyinaa.
But it is very simple.	Nanso ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
That is the end of the matter.	Ɛno ne asɛm no awiei.
That was a really big deal.	Ná ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse ankasa.
You have to do the work for me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma no ma me.
I want to know too.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nso.
Finally, it was over.	Awiei koraa no, na aba awiei.
He wanted her out too.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno nso fi adi.
He never wanted me or him.	Ná ɔmpɛ me anaa ɔno da.
He could actually play.	Ná obetumi adi agoru ankasa.
Turn around and take me home.	Dan wo ho na fa me kɔ fie.
Where he was, there was something real.	Baabi a na ɔwɔ no, na biribi ankasa wɔ hɔ.
This is from me.	Eyi fi me hɔ.
It just looked like a big game.	Ná ɛte sɛ agoru kɛse bi kɛkɛ.
You can’t understand how that might work.	Worentumi nte sɛnea ebia ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma no ase.
The story goes beyond that.	Asɛm no kɔ akyiri sen saa.
Go further now.	Kɔ kɔ akyiri mprempren.
You can’t do just one thing and not the other.	Worentumi nyɛ ade biako pɛ na worentumi nyɛ biako no.
At least the two are friends.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔn baanu no yɛ nnamfo.
As in every aspect of the game.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ agoru no fã biara mu no.
You have to use time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode bere di dwuma.
No one else can do the job.	Obi foforo biara ntumi nyɛ adwuma no.
Tomorrow, first thing.	Ɔkyena, ade a edi kan.
I was a life.	Ná meyɛ nkwa.
He is not in there now.	Ɛnyɛ seesei na ɔwɔ mu hɔ.
He was enjoying the situation.	Ná n’ani gyee tebea no ho.
I did something for you, and you know what it is.	Meyɛɛ biribi maa wo, na wunim nea ɛyɛ.
But that’s the bulk of the story.	Nanso ɛno ne asɛm no fã kɛse no ara.
Their uniforms were exotic, durable and expensive.	Ná wɔn ntade no yɛ nwonwa, na ɛyɛ den na ne bo yɛ den.
Live in the moment.	Tra ase wɔ bere a wowɔ mu no mu.
Be careful, too.	Hwɛ yiye.
Any given day.	Da biara a wɔde ama.
However, this is only part of the story.	Nanso, eyi yɛ asɛm no fã bi kɛkɛ.
The past causes problems for him.	Nea atwam no de ɔhaw ahorow ba no so.
Now he wants to make movies.	Seesei ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ sini.
That’s the job.	Ɛno ne adwuma no.
There seems to be daily traffic down there.	Ɛte sɛ nea kar tu da biara da wɔ fam hɔ.
They were both shocked.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa ho dwiriw wɔn.
The reason for this issue is actually quite simple.	Nea enti a asɛm yi ba no yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa ankasa.
That’s right, and it’s not.	Ɛte saa, na ɛnte saa.
Time was scarce.	Ná bere ho yɛ na.
There was nothing for him to do here.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a ɔbɛyɛ wɔ ha.
No need to go to the park.	Ɛho nhia sɛ obi kɔ abɔnten so.
He shouldn’t say that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔka saa.
And she could say without a doubt that she loved it.	Na na obetumi aka a akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ n’ani gye ho.
He had no one else.	Ná onni obi foforo biara.
Lots of interesting stuff.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye pii.
He likes a lot of things, and he likes them.	Nneɛma pii ani gye ho, na n’ani gye ho.
Two could play as easily as one.	Ná baanu betumi adi agoru a ɛnyɛ den te sɛ biako.
He does so and succeeds.	Ɔyɛ saa na odi yiye.
He made a smug face.	Ɔyɛɛ anim a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
You are both on the list now.	Mo baanu nyinaa wɔ din no mu mprempren.
Whether he wants it doesn’t matter.	Sɛ́ ɔpɛ no mfa ho.
Include them alone.	Fa wɔn nkutoo ka ho.
He’s the one with me.	Ɔno ne me.
Take it a lot.	Fa no pii.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Asɛm biara nni ho.
Your wife was right.	Ná wo yere asɛm no yɛ nokware.
So no one went.	Enti obiara ankɔ.
This afternoon, maybe.	Awia yi, ebia.
The way you do it.	Sɛnea woyɛ no.
I love being a girl.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ abeawa.
The people are like people.	Nkurɔfo no te sɛ nnipa.
It was that simple.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
I had to work for him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma ma no.
This house is very expensive.	Saa ofie yi bo yɛ den yiye.
That’s not a bad thing happening.	Ɛno nyɛ ade bɔne a ɛrekɔ so.
It may be crowded.	Ebia na nnipa ahyɛ mu ma.
It sounds simple but it’s not.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw nanso ɛnte saa.
The child had to go.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ abofra no kɔ.
There are many now.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ mprempren.
Keep your eyes peeled, here.	Ma w’ani nna hɔ, ha.
Hope you like what you see.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye nea wuhu no ho.
We spent the rest of the afternoon talking about the film.	Yɛde awia no fã a aka no kaa sini no ho asɛm.
In their rooms.	Wɔ wɔn dan mu no.
That was what he wanted the most.	Ɛno ne nea na ɔpɛ sen biara.
Speak as it is.	Kasa sɛnea ɛte.
None of us can get things right every time.	Yɛn mu biara ntumi nnya nneɛma yiye bere biara.
I wanted my old car.	Ná mepɛ me kar dedaw no.
The same will be true of these things.	Saa ara na ɛbɛyɛ nokware wɔ saa nneɛma yi ho.
I would do anything for him.	Anka mɛyɛ biribiara ama no.
None of that exists anymore.	Ɛno mu biara nni hɔ bio.
You’ve done me a favor.	Woayɛ me yiye.
She has nice clothes.	Ɔwɔ ntade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
There are many other reasons.	Nneɛma foforo pii nso wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
You do a lot of it.	Wo na woyɛ pii.
However, he should not intimidate her.	Nanso, ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ no hu.
More on this next week.	Eyi ho nsɛm pii dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
Something big was going on.	Ná biribi kɛse bi rekɔ so.
Food is scarce there now.	Aduan ho yɛ na wɔ hɔ mprempren.
It was his reputation.	Ná ɛyɛ ne din pa.
Things are amazing.	Nneɛma yɛ nwonwa.
Just as he liked it.	Sɛnea n’ani gyee ho no ara pɛ.
It works, but it’s expensive.	Ɛyɛ adwuma, nanso ne bo yɛ den.
We have enough money problems as it is.	Yɛwɔ sika ho haw a ɛdɔɔso sɛnea ɛte no.
It was a game you two played.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a mo baanu di.
I want to do something interesting.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ anigye.
So why not.	Enti dɛn nti na ɛnte saa.
I could go outside.	Ná metumi akɔ abɔnten.
I love that group there.	M’ani gye saa kuw no ho wɔ hɔ.
This was not in real time.	Ná eyi nyɛ bere ankasa mu.
You shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I don’t know how it’s happened.	Minnim sɛnea abam.
That year, they were troubled by various things.	Saa afe no, nneɛma ahorow ho haw wɔn.
All at the same time.	Ne nyinaa bere koro mu.
The boy quickly headed for the door.	Abofra no yɛɛ ntɛm de n’ani kyerɛɛ ɔpon no ano.
I wish him the best.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nea eye sen biara.
You have a plan.	Wowɔ nhyehyɛe bi.
Not for a year or two.	Ɛnyɛ afe biako anaa abien.
No one knows where you are.	Obiara nnim baabi a wowɔ.
The experiment took years.	Wɔde mfe pii yɛɛ sɔhwɛ no.
It was a pleasure.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye.
You see it’s true.	Wuhu sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
I have a house.	Mewɔ ofie bi.
That all worked really well.	Ɛno nyinaa yɛɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
I was there.	Ná mewɔ hɔ.
That would be good.	Ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
There was no one there.	Ná obiara nni hɔ.
And not often enough for us to anticipate.	Na ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii a ɛdɔɔso sɛ yebetumi ahwɛ kwan.
At the windows.	Wɔ mfɛnsere no ho.
He didn't know the whole story.	Ná onnim asɛm no nyinaa.
But that is a whole other story.	Nanso ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo koraa.
Just as he had done.	Sɛnea na wayɛ no ara pɛ.
I just got off the phone with them.	Me ne wɔn fii telefon no so ara pɛ.
So it was great.	Enti na ɛyɛ kɛse.
Or the past.	Anaasɛ nea atwam.
It’s a mistake.	Ɛyɛ mfomso.
One of the most important is timing.	Nea ɛho hia paa no mu biako ne bere a wɔde yɛ adwuma.
In our test, none of that.	Wɔ yɛn sɔhwɛ no mu no, ɛno mu biara nni hɔ.
He wasn’t good, either.	Ná ɔnyɛ papa, nso.
And that’s great, too.	Na ɛno nso yɛ kɛse.
So that’s no problem.	Enti ɛno nyɛ ɔhaw biara.
We are only interested in life.	Yɛn ani gye nkwa ho nkutoo.
And I want to, you know that.	Na mepɛ, wunim saa.
And he had to drive to school every day.	Na na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde kar kɔ sukuu da biara.
I’m not sure.	M’ani nnye ho.
That’s the one.	Ɛno ne no.
You should have thought about it.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
Some species can eat almost anything.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mmoa ahorow bi tumi di biribiara.
You can’t do that.	Worentumi nyɛ saa.
He had to be relocated.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde no san kɔ baabi a ɔte.
It’s something you have to do.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Someone made the whole thing.	Obi na ɔyɛɛ ade no nyinaa.
The room is filled with water.	Nsu ahyɛ dan no mu ma.
For him, it didn’t matter.	Ne de no, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
He should give you that dress.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde saa atade no ma wo.
You have to take it to another job.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode kɔ adwuma foforo mu.
I hope not too.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ saa nso.
No one can help me.	Obiara ntumi mmoa me.
So few things were needed for this, it seemed.	Enti na nneɛma kakraa bi na ɛho hia ma eyi, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ no.
He was the one who used to do that.	Ná ɔno na na ɔyɛ saa pɛn.
Maybe that will happen this year.	Ebia ɛno bɛba afe yi.
He does it himself again.	Ɔno ankasa yɛ bio.
The leather coat is warm.	Atade a wɔde aboa nhoma ayɛ no yɛ hyew.
However, this is not a good idea.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ adwene pa.
They had to tell him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka kyerɛ no.
Let me think about it.	Ma minsusuw ho.
That’s a huge amount of money.	Ɛno yɛ sika kɛse paa.
They give and receive.	Wɔde ma na wɔn nsa ka.
Never lie to anyone about anything.	Nni atoro nkyerɛ obiara da wɔ biribiara ho.
Something strange happened.	Ade bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii.
It was so incredibly beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ a ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
Take control of yourself.	Di wo ho so.
This feels really bad.	Eyi te nka sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne ankasa.
I just wondered why.	Misusuw nea enti a ɛte saa ho ara kwa.
I want to talk about them.	Mepɛ sɛ meka wɔn ho asɛm.
For many reasons.	Nneɛma pii ho.
He has his plan.	Ɔwɔ ne nhyehyɛe.
He can do anything.	Obetumi ayɛ biribiara.
I wish it was me.	Me yam a anka ɛyɛ me.
Be careful!	Hwɛ yiye!
They came running at me.	Wɔde mmirika baa me so.
The party is over, my friends.	Apontow no aba awiei, me nnamfo.
It’s also difficult.	Ɛyɛ den nso.
There were few problems along the way.	Ná ɔhaw kakraa bi na ɛwɔ kwan no so.
That’s just this morning.	Ɛno yɛ anɔpa yi nkutoo.
None of them have any money.	Wɔn mu biara nni sika biara.
There were two more in the background.	Ná abien foforo wɔ akyi.
That was one thing.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade biako.
They love to play.	Wɔn ani gye agoru ho.
But we are here for some time.	Nanso yɛwɔ ha bere bi.
Even if it works out.	Sɛ ɛyɛ yiye mpo a.
To keep an eye on it.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wɔde wɔn ani besi so.
But there is nothing else.	Nanso biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
I will tell you where he lives.	Meka baabi a ɔte kyerɛ mo.
They say he is not good.	Wɔka sɛ ɔnyɛ papa.
This happens when the project takes a long time.	Eyi ba bere a adwuma no gye bere tenten no.
Nothing, really.	Biribiara nni hɔ, ampa.
Not outside yet!.	Ɛnyɛ abɔnten de besi nnɛ!.
And yet, it’s happening anyway.	Na nanso, ɛrekɔ so ɔkwan biara so.
One way or another, the man has to go.	Ɔkwan bi so anaa ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbarima no kɔ.
Hurt me in pain.	Hu me yaw.
The man was unconscious.	Ná ɔbarima no nnim hwee.
But there is much, much more.	Nanso pii wɔ hɔ, pii wɔ hɔ.
I never need to know that.	Ɛho nhia sɛ mihu saa da.
He shouldn't have done that.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
But you have to put in work.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ adwuma mu.
It is important to be efficient.	Ɛho hia sɛ woyɛ adwuma yiye.
As you can see.	Sɛnea wuhu no.
He didn't know what had happened.	Ná onnim nea asi.
That said, a latecomer equals an absence.	Ɛno akyi no, obi a ɔka akyi no ne obi a onni hɔ no yɛ pɛ.
That’s what my name means.	Ɛno ne nea me din kyerɛ.
This can cause problems.	Eyi betumi de ɔhaw ahorow aba.
He knew she was beautiful.	Ná onim sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I don’t have to do that.	Ɛho nhia sɛ meyɛ saa.
The school made a mistake in the final exam.	Sukuu no dii mfomso wɔ sɔhwɛ a etwa to no mu.
That’s what they’re good at.	Ɛno ne nea wɔn ho akokwaw wɔ mu.
The situation was difficult.	Ná tebea no yɛ den.
He didn’t like driving.	Ná n’ani nnye ho sɛ ɔbɛka kar.
Thank him, say goodnight.	Meda no ase, ka sɛ anadwo pa.
But the police were there.	Nanso na polisifo no wɔ hɔ.
We are here to stay.	Yɛwɔ ha.
That sounds awesome!	Ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu!
But there was nothing.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ.
He is incredibly likeable.	Ɔyɛ obi a n’ani gye ne ho wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
Just look, and this is you.	Hwɛ ara, na eyi ne wo.
Forget the money.	Wo werɛ mfi sika no.
I don’t have any money now.	Minni sika biara mprempren.
This was realistic.	Ná eyi yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
If you figure something out, that’s fine.	Sɛ wususuw biribi ho a, eye.
At least we can try.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yebetumi abɔ mmɔden.
That’s what you said.	Saa na wokae.
I have other interests.	Mewɔ nneɛma foforo a m’ani gye ho kɛse.
It must be done properly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no yiye.
It was nothing enough.	Na ɛnyɛ hwee sɛnea ɛsɛ.
So, what can you say?	Enti, dɛn na wubetumi aka?
This was always his problem.	Ná eyi yɛ ne haw bere nyinaa.
And he could.	Na na obetumi.
The water will be very hot.	Nsu no bɛyɛ hyew paa.
Give it to me.	Fa ma me.
It was widely used in the past.	Wɔde dii dwuma kɛse wɔ bere a atwam no mu.
I think he does it for me.	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛ ma me.
She is such a force, a presence.	Ɔyɛ tumi a ɛte saa, obi a ɔwɔ hɔ.
I lie down under the music.	Meda fam wɔ nnwom no ase.
The dinner is over.	Anwummere aduan no aba awiei.
Check it out if you want.	Hwɛ mu sɛ wopɛ a.
I couldn’t leave fast enough.	Na mintumi mfi hɔ ntɛmntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
And you want to know why.	Na wopɛ sɛ wuhu nea enti a ɛte saa.
This was not the same thing at all.	Ná eyi nyɛ ade koro koraa.
There is no one at all.	Obiara nni hɔ koraa.
Everything must be done for him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribiara ma no.
I'm telling stories.	Meka nsɛm.
These people are beautiful.	Saa nkurɔfo yi ho yɛ fɛ.
This happened several times.	Eyi sii mpɛn pii.
This dress is gorgeous!	Saa atade yi yɛ fɛ yiye!
Whatever it is .	Nea ɛyɛ biara no .
But the house was empty.	Nanso na hwee nni ofie no mu.
To me, that says a lot.	Wɔ me fam no, ɛno ka pii.
Everything is happening so fast.	Biribiara rekɔ so ntɛmntɛm saa.
I think he would really enjoy it.	Misusuw sɛ n’ani begye ho ankasa.
I had no idea what my father had planned.	Ná minnim nea me papa ayɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
Take the car out today.	Fa kar no fi adi nnɛ.
We all do that.	Yɛn nyinaa yɛ saa.
Whatever you want.	Nea wopɛ biara.
Remember, any feedback is good feedback.	Kae sɛ, nsɛm biara a wɔde bɛma no yɛ nsɛm pa a wɔde bɛma.
Additional grants are awarded each year.	Wɔde mmoa foforo ma afe biara.
Finally, he joined you.	Awiei koraa no, ɔde ne ho bɔɔ mo.
He hadn't been for years.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa mfe pii ni.
Two simple things like that.	Nneɛma abien a ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
But it was too late for that.	Nanso na aka akyi dodo ama saa.
You put yourself in their shoes.	Wode wo ho to wɔn tebea mu.
Some information may be outdated.	Ebia nsɛm bi ne bere atwam.
And nothing went wrong out here.	Na biribiara anyɛ yiye wɔ ha akyi.
That doesn’t work here.	Ɛno ntumi nyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
At least that’s what he told himself.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho saa.
There is danger tonight.	Asiane wɔ hɔ anadwo yi.
Look at my mother.	Hwɛ me maame.
He leaned against the gun.	Ɔde ne ho too tuo no so.
Each of them told their story.	Wɔn mu biara kaa wɔn asɛm.
Which is completely new to me.	Nea ɛyɛ foforo koraa ma me.
But for the most part he was a nice kid.	Nanso fã kɛse no ara no na ɔyɛ abofra a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I still have that picture.	Meda so ara wɔ saa mfonini no.
It’s something completely different.	Ɛyɛ biribi foforo koraa.
People are very interested in it.	Nkurɔfo ani gye ho yiye.
I really wanted to.	Ná mepɛ ankasa.
There is no overall plan.	Nhyehyɛe biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ nhyehyɛe no nyinaa.
I recently applied this idea to another house.	Nnansa yi ara mede saa adwene yi dii dwuma wɔ ofie foforo mu.
It’s a sin.	Ɛyɛ bɔne bi.
Can you please guide me.	Mesrɛ wo, wubetumi akyerɛ me kwan.
Everyone here does.	Obiara a ɔwɔ ha no yɛ saa.
It has a good reputation.	Ɛwɔ din pa.
There was only one other chance.	Na hokwan foforo biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Make my mind easy'.	Ma m'adwene nyɛ mmerɛw'.
Not being the one everyone looks at.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ́ obi a obiara hwɛ ne no.
He is perfectly perfect.	Ɔyɛ pɛ a ɛyɛ pɛ.
It’s really quite scary.	Ɛyɛ hu koraa ankasa.
He says that.	Ɔka sɛ.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I am very beautiful.	Me ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
This book was the only one available.	Saa nhoma yi nkutoo na na ɛwɔ hɔ.
We really enjoy it.	Yɛn ani gye ho ankasa.
Hope you enjoy it!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho!.
Nothing else in the room.	Nneɛma foforo biara nni dan no mu.
This is the whole truth.	Eyi ne nokware no nyinaa.
We are just children.	Yɛyɛ mmofra ara kwa.
He was still with her.	Ná ɔne no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
It was a party.	Ná ɛyɛ apontow bi.
It’s hot in here.	Ɛyɛ hyew wɔ ha mu.
the problem is.	ɔhaw no.
This was not his character.	Ná eyi nyɛ ne su.
I understand better now, just a little bit.	Mete ase yiye mprempren, kakra kɛkɛ.
Look at the picture.	Hwɛ mfonini no.
He touched the doorknob.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ɔpon no ano.
I think that’s what this team is made of.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne nea wɔde ayɛ saa kuw yi.
I plan to do that.	Meyɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
Or say nothing.	Anaasɛ nka hwee.
I don’t know anything about it.	Minnim ho hwee.
That was a great game.	Ná ɛno yɛ agoru kɛse.
I have also made up my mind.	Me nso mayɛ adwene.
But it was great.	Nanso na ɛyɛ kɛse.
It was a beautiful morning.	Ná ɛyɛ anɔpa a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I'm sure you remember too.	Migye di sɛ wo nso wokae.
What about you?.	Wo dɛn?.
They say they don’t like each other.	Wɔka sɛ wɔn ani nnye wɔn ho wɔn ho ho.
The task is not complicated.	Adwuma no nyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
You have to work for what you want.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma ma nea wopɛ.
How well things went.	Sɛnea nneɛma kɔɔ so yiye.
I can make him happy.	Metumi ama n’ani agye.
I don’t like that idea.	M’ani nnye saa adwene no ho.
It’s not really that.	Ɛnte saa ankasa.
It was a pleasure to be with you.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye sɛ me ne wo bɛbɔ.
I knew nothing about this.	Ná minnim eyi ho hwee.
His condition was terrible that day.	Ná ne tebea yɛ hu saa da no.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani gye ho ankasa.
Maybe I shouldn’t.	Ebia ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
Moreover, he did so so that he could leave work early.	Bio nso, ɔyɛɛ saa sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a obetumi afi adwumam ntɛm.
And if you do, keep it simple if you can.	Na sɛ woyɛ saa a, sɛ wubetumi a, ma ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
To be honest, he's a little weird.	Sɛ mɛka nokware a, ɔyɛ nwonwa kakra.
That was more difficult.	Ná ɛno yɛ den sen saa.
You must always tell the truth.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka nokware bere nyinaa.
That one is not true.	Saa biako no nyɛ nokware.
So just be careful with that.	Enti kɛkɛ, hwɛ yiye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
And it was true.	Na ɛyɛ nokware.
Feel completely.	Te nka koraa.
These results are not new.	Nea afi mu aba yi nyɛ ade foforo.
I always want to go.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ bere nyinaa.
You have the last meal.	Wowɔ aduan a etwa to.
It's pretty pricey enough for me.	Ɛyɛ fɛ bo a ɛdɔɔso ma me.
Any accident.	Akwanhyia biara.
It’s just hard for me.	Ɛyɛ den ma me ara kwa.
But the truth is quite the opposite.	Nanso nokware no yɛ nea ɛnte saa koraa.
Send.	Ma ne.
I'm sorry, you say.	Mepa wo kyɛw, woka.
It is not so.	Ɛnte saa.
You all know the story and the situation.	Mo nyinaa nim asɛm no ne tebea no.
He had only one job now.	Ná ɔwɔ adwuma biako pɛ mprempren.
The footrests.	Nan a wɔde hyɛ nan ase no.
After all, he knows everything looks good to him.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, onim sɛ biribiara hwɛ no yiye.
It’s not what’s on it.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ so.
But it’s a good one.	Nanso ɛyɛ nea eye.
The man said it was a mistake.	Ɔbarima no kae sɛ na ɛyɛ mfomso.
But jobs are at risk.	Nanso nnwuma da asiane mu.
I can’t hear you.	Mintumi nte wo.
Neither task is easy.	Adwuma abien no mu biara nyɛ mmerɛw.
It’s not necessarily bad.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ bɔne ankasa.
Definitely not a good idea.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ adwene pa.
But this was still beautiful.	Nanso na eyi da so ara yɛ fɛ.
He had one arm.	Ná ɔwɔ nsa biako.
He never did these things.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa nneɛma yi da.
I have an appointment with the designer later.	Me ne obi a ɔyɛ mfonini no ayɛ nhyehyɛe akyiri yi.
I couldn’t believe it was happening to me.	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɛrekɔ so wɔ me so.
However, things didn’t quite go that well.	Nanso, nneɛma ankɔ yiye saa koraa.
I felt better about myself.	Me ho tɔɔ me.
However, many people are not happy with their plan.	Nanso, nnipa pii ani nnye wɔn nhyehyɛe no ho.
I would be a better person.	Anka mɛyɛ onipa pa.
I'm happy for you.	M'ani agye ma wo.
Take them if you must.	Fa wɔn sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ a.
It’s a real thing.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
How much does a new car cost?	Kar foforo bo yɛ dɛn?
That is not the point.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
Look, sex is about sex.	Hwɛ, nna fa nna ho.
Unless they do that.	Gye sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Our hands just kind of do it.	Yɛn nsa yɛ no ɔkwan bi so ara kwa.
It’s just amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
You tell them.	Woka kyerɛ wɔn.
The story shocked me.	Asɛm no maa me ho dwiriw me.
I know this is a bad time.	Minim sɛ eyi yɛ bere bɔne.
But maybe it was true.	Nanso ebia na ɛyɛ nokware.
If we could just go home.	Sɛ yebetumi akɔ fie ara kwa.
It’s just what we do.	Ɛyɛ nea yɛyɛ ara kwa.
His stay was brief.	Ná ne tra no yɛ bere tiaa bi.
Can you tell me how your father took it.	Wubetumi aka sɛnea wo papa faa no akyerɛ me.
You work towards them.	Woyɛ adwuma kɔ wɔn nkyɛn.
He nodded sharply.	Ɔde ne ti too fam denneennen.
Stay in your room.	Tra wo dan mu.
She is very bright.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hyew yiye.
His car has seen better days.	Ne kar no ahu nna a eye sen saa.
More on that another time.	Ɛno ho nsɛm pii bere foforo.
Be careful about it.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ ho.
Imagine if you have kids.	Fa no sɛ wowɔ mmofra a.
No one knows where he is.	Obiara nnim baabi a ɔwɔ.
That’s a long one.	Ɛno yɛ tenten.
There was hardly any room.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na dan biara nni hɔ.
You have definitely put in the work.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wode ahyɛ adwuma no mu.
There is much to be done about here.	Pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔ ha ho.
One year of your use is over.	Afe biako a wode dii dwuma no aba awiei.
However, it wasn’t.	Nanso, na ɛnte saa.
He took it home.	Ɔde kɔɔ fie.
There was nothing he could do for me.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ ama me.
The day itself was nothing short of amazing.	Ná da no ankasa nyɛ nwonwa koraa.
But there is also an easier way.	Nanso ɔkwan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw nso wɔ hɔ.
I also give him the diary.	Mede da biara da nsɛm nhoma no nso ma no.
So he did what he had to do.	Enti ɔyɛɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
But recently.	Nanso nnansa yi.
Except at night.	Gye sɛ anadwo.
You don’t have to believe me.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wugye me di.
It was empty, absolutely empty.	Ná hwee nni mu, na na hwee nni mu koraa.
Here's the problem with that.	Ɔhaw a ɛwɔ saa asɛm no ho ni.
It seems to be there.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ.
I recognized it immediately.	Mihuu no ntɛm ara.
There was music in that.	Ná nnwom wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
Just that one time.	Saa bere biako no nkutoo.
Not in their situation.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn tebea no mu.
But he wasn’t here.	Nanso na onni ha.
Most people do jobs they don’t enjoy.	Nnipa dodow no ara yɛ nnwuma a wɔn ani nnye ho.
His posts are unlike any other.	Nsɛm a ɔde asi hɔ no nte sɛ nsɛm foforo biara.
This is the general idea.	Eyi ne adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa.
This is a test!	Eyi yɛ sɔhwɛ!
I have something just like you.	Mewɔ biribi a ɛte sɛ wo ara.
Not really good.	Ɛnyɛ nea eye ankasa.
There is a view.	Adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ.
Give me your best shot.	Ma me wo tuo a eye sen biara.
That is a huge problem.	Ɛno yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
That’s only half the game though.	Ɛno yɛ agoru no fã pɛ de, nanso.
Half of it is.	Ne fã yɛ.
Look at my eyes.	Hwɛ m’ani so.
You already have a reputation as the scary one.	Wowɔ din dedaw sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu no.
So they are used.	Enti wɔde di dwuma.
That’s pretty good.	Ɛno yɛ papa yiye.
Tough.	Den.
This has been a pleasure.	Eyi ayɛ anigye.
It shouldn’t be a problem for you.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔhaw ma wo.
Little did I know it was the last one.	Ná minnim sɛ ɛyɛ nea etwa to.
I can say that much.	Metumi aka saa pii.
Now everything is expensive.	Mprempren biribiara bo yɛ den.
It works on two levels.	Ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ nsɛm abien so.
Put it on your desk.	Fa no to wo pon so.
It was surprisingly cheap.	Ná ne bo yɛ mmerɛw ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I am a big girl.	Meyɛ abeawa kɛse.
There was something else at work.	Na biribi foforo nso wɔ adwumam.
This is a powerful thing.	Eyi yɛ ade a tumi wom.
The whole group is presented.	Wɔde kuw no nyinaa kyerɛ.
I might make one more of that.	Ebia mɛyɛ biako bio a ɛte saa.
It should be used whenever possible.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma bere biara a ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
The house is very warm.	Ofie no mu yɛ hyew kɛse.
Everyone knows that.	Obiara nim saa.
I think of my mother.	Misusuw me maame ho.
It’s very nice.	Ɛyɛ paa.
You don’t know what it’s going to be like.	Wunnim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ.
I did what I was told.	Meyɛɛ nea wɔka kyerɛɛ me no.
And the last one, too.	Na nea etwa to no nso.
No one seemed to be there.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obiara nni hɔ.
You are beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ.
Take good care of your children.	Hwɛ wo mma yiye.
It was too bad we couldn’t have taken him with us.	Na ɛyɛ bɔne dodo sɛ anka yɛrentumi mfa no nka yɛn ho.
It shouldn’t be too hard.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den dodo.
It felt like I knew him.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea minim no.
I've got it now.	Me nsa aka no seesei.
I can’t say enough good things about it.	Mintumi nka nsɛm pa a ɛdɔɔso mfa ho.
His father built the house with his own hands.	Ne papa na ɔde ne nsa sii ofie no.
You are not the danger.	Ɛnyɛ wo ne asiane no.
Interesting thought though.	Adwene a ɛyɛ anigye de, nanso.
But no one else can do it.	Nanso obi foforo biara ntumi nyɛ.
However, this was all he could tell them.	Nanso, na eyi nkutoo ne nea na obetumi aka akyerɛ wɔn.
Behind this front room was another door.	Ná ɔpon foforo wɔ anim dan yi akyi.
But he thinks they shouldn’t have.	Nanso osusuw sɛ anka ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I thought it was wonderful.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
They should not be played with.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn di agoru.
But it’s not like that anymore.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa bio.
It was important.	Ná ɛho hia.
He was the intelligent one.	Ná ɔno ne obi a onim nyansa.
He liked the idea.	N’ani gyee adwene no ho.
I’ll be happy when it’s over.	M’ani begye bere a aba awiei no.
Eventually, that will be your home.	Awiei koraa no, ɛno bɛyɛ wo fie.
The handle fits snugly into the car.	Nsa no hyɛ kar no mu yiye.
No one really told him.	Obiara ankasa ankyerɛ no.
Don’t get away from me.	Mma mfi me ho nkɔ.
And most of you.	Na dodow no ara wo.
Which is wrong.	Nea ɛyɛ mfomso.
Not every night.	Ɛnyɛ anadwo biara.
The excitement would continue.	Ná anigye no bɛkɔ so.
Have.	Wɔ.
This is when the meeting took place.	Saa bere yi na nhyiam no sii.
The following month.	Ɔsram a edi hɔ no.
So my school days are over now.	Enti me sukuu nna no aba awiei mprempren.
I think there were two elements to that.	Misusuw sɛ na nneɛma abien bi wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
He is a beautiful character.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
People usually said it was good.	Mpɛn pii no na nkurɔfo kyerɛ sɛ eye.
I'm sorry about that, but there's a reason.	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ saa asɛm no ho, nanso biribi wɔ hɔ a enti a ɛte saa.
Most rely heavily on the story.	Dodow no ara de wɔn ho to asɛm no so kɛse.
Don’t let this be about me.	Mma eyi nyɛ me ho asɛm.
Unless you do that.	Gye sɛ woyɛ saa.
But it was still difficult.	Nanso na ɛda so ara yɛ den.
That was always a problem for him.	Ná ɛno yɛ ɔhaw ma no bere nyinaa.
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
It looked completely artificial.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔde nsa ayɛ koraa.
I am a very good person.	Meyɛ onipa pa paa.
Everything any human has done you can do too.	Biribiara a onipa biara ayɛ wo nso wubetumi ayɛ.
And it did seem to work.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma ampa.
This system has a number of uses.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi wɔ nneɛma ahorow bi a wɔde di dwuma.
It should be but it isn’t.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa nanso ɛnte saa.
This is obviously something we need to work on.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi yɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho adwuma.
It is a characteristic	Ɛyɛ su a ɛda adi .
I was like, this is so great.	Na me te sɛ, eyi yɛ kɛse paa.
That surprised me.	Ɛno maa me ho dwiriw me.
But if man wants to solve these problems, he can.	Nanso sɛ onipa pɛ sɛ odi ɔhaw ahorow yi ho dwuma a, obetumi.
This house feels like that.	Saa ofie yi te nka saa.
I am now very happy.	Mprempren m’ani agye yiye.
But most didn’t.	Nanso dodow no ara anyɛ saa.
If he was here he could give us words.	Sɛ ɔwɔ ha a na obetumi de nsɛm aka akyerɛ yɛn.
Please put my name in the hat for the picture.	Mesrɛ wo, fa me din hyɛ kyɛw no mu ma mfonini no.
So it wasn’t easy.	Enti na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
I'm not going to go.	Me deɛ, me ntumi nkɔ.
They also work fast.	Wɔyɛ adwuma ntɛmntɛm nso.
I really like the idea.	M’ani gye adwene no ho ankasa.
Too many things seemed to depend on him.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea nneɛma pii dodo no de ne ho to no so.
What is so remarkable about it? 	Dɛn na ɛyɛ nwonwa saa wɔ ho?
Everyone said the same thing, backwards.	Obiara kaa asɛm koro no ara, akyi.
I love a good self-image.	M’ani gye me ho mfonini pa ho.
Activate those projects quickly.	Fa saa nnwuma no yɛ adwuma ntɛm.
No one was in danger.	Ná obiara nkɔ asiane mu.
Time for me to go too.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ me nso mekɔ.
Should be an interesting game.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ agoru a ɛyɛ anigye.
It was a power thing.	Ná ɛyɛ tumi ade.
I believe this is the case.	Migye di sɛ eyi te saa.
But this was not the only remarkable development.	Nanso ɛnyɛ eyi nkutoo ne ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa a esii.
You just can’t have bad food.	Worentumi nnya aduan bɔne kɛkɛ.
Too many of them anyway.	Wɔn mu pii dodo ɔkwan biara so.
So, check it out.	Enti, hwɛ mu.
He ran downstairs.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ fam.
Just look at it.	Hwɛ kɛkɛ.
I told my mom, thinking it was no big deal.	Meka kyerɛɛ me maame, a na misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse.
But that didn’t work either.	Nanso ɛno nso anyɛ adwuma.
Close the window!	To mfɛnsere no mu!
I must be in you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ wo mu.
So be thankful for what you have.	Enti da ase wɔ nea wowɔ ho.
Maybe you have your night time.	Ebia wowɔ wo anadwo bere mu.
In a larger way.	Wɔ ɔkwan kɛse so.
Lead the way.	Di kwan no anim.
And it was terrible.	Na ɛyɛ hu.
Clearly, he enjoyed the work.	Ɛda adi sɛ na n’ani gye adwuma no ho.
This can happen in a few hours to a few days.	Eyi betumi aba wɔ nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi kosi nna kakraa bi mu.
And by the way, there is nothing else here.	Na ɔkwan bi so no, biribi foforo biara nni ha.
But in the end, he did.	Nanso awiei koraa no, ɔyɛɛ saa.
This is the latest trend.	Eyi ne nneɛma a aba so foforo.
You have to put him back down.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode no san to fam.
And it had to be done quickly.	Na na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no ntɛm.
I can feed you more.	Metumi ama wo aduan pii.
However, the working days.	Nanso, nna a ɛyɛ adwuma no.
Don’t use it.	Mfa nni dwuma.
This way, it doesn’t.	Saa kwan yi so, ɛnyɛ saa.
This may not even be his window.	Ebia eyi nyɛ ne mfɛnsere mpo.
Or whatever that was.	Anaasɛ nea na ɛno te biara.
A simple arrangement.	Nhyehyɛe a ɛnyɛ den.
He is the real person.	Ɔno ne obi a ɔwɔ hɔ ankasa.
The meal as it was was over.	Ná aduan no te sɛ nea na ɛte no aba awiei.
I was convinced.	Ná migye di.
John often wore a hat.	Ná John taa hyɛ kyɛw.
It’s a mistake.	Ɛyɛ mfomso.
You could see it in his eyes.	Ná wubetumi ahu wɔ n’ani so.
I received a letter from him.	Me nsa kaa krataa fii ne hɔ.
That was not my home.	Ná ɛno nyɛ me fie.
You were told to do so.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ yɛ saa.
My father used to walk long distances.	Me papa taa nantew tenten.
So make sure we can find the important information quickly.	Enti hwɛ hu sɛ yebetumi ahu nsɛm a ɛho hia no ntɛm.
This is a great day for both of our species.	Eyi yɛ da kɛse ma yɛn ahorow abien no nyinaa.
He didn't know what he was doing.	Ná onnim nea ɔreyɛ.
So much has happened since then.	Enti nneɛma pii asi fi saa bere no.
Cold to the bottom.	Awɔw kosi ase.
I was always in school.	Ná mewɔ sukuu mu bere nyinaa.
That is no longer true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware bio.
He had to get involved.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu.
The power is tremendous.	Tumi no yɛ kɛse.
Or its products and services.	Anaasɛ ne nneɛma ne ne nnwuma.
This doesn’t work.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
I think a man is trying to do that.	Misusuw sɛ ɔbarima bi rebɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
That was so painful!	Ɛno yɛɛ yaw kɛse!
It’s pretty bad.	Ɛyɛ bɔne yiye.
Very happy for myself.	Anigye kɛse ma me ho.
I have better things to do with my mind.	Mewɔ nneɛma pa a mede m’adwene bɛyɛ.
This was a lie.	Ná eyi yɛ atoro.
Often.	Mpɛn pii.
I told him the same thing.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​saa ara.
She was the only girl in the group.	Ná ɔno nkutoo ne abeawa a ɔwɔ kuw no mu.
All my friends are here.	Me nnamfo nyinaa wɔ ha.
He does a job that very few people do.	Ɔyɛ adwuma a nnipa kakraa bi pɛ na wɔyɛ.
The week will be good for many.	Dapɛn no bɛyɛ papa ama nnipa pii.
Life lived on.	Nkwa traa ase.
I don’t want my child to do what you do.	Mempɛ sɛ me ba no bɛyɛ nea woyɛ no.
He was in the here and now.	Na ɔwɔ ha ne mprempren no mu.
There were problems with both plans.	Ná ɔhaw ahorow wɔ nhyehyɛe abien no nyinaa mu.
So, how do we travel?'	Enti, yɛyɛ dɛn tu kwan?’
Group sex, leathering, bestiality.	Kuw mu nna, aboa nhoma a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu, mmoa a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu.
That is not a new idea.	Ɛno nyɛ adwene foforo.
But this was something completely different.	Nanso na eyi yɛ ade foforo koraa.
It’s not us, it’s them.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn, wɔn.
Which is also terrifying.	Nea ɛyɛ hu nso.
That can get hard quite quickly.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ den ntɛmntɛm koraa.
Control yourself, he told himself.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ, di wo ho so.
This will cause problems in the supply chain.	Eyi de ɔhaw ahorow bɛba nneɛma a wɔde ma no mu.
That was a while ago.	Ɛno yɛ bere tiaa bi a atwam ni.
Or if you do .	Anaasɛ sɛ woyɛ saa a .
He was unemployed for a year.	Ná onni adwuma afe biako.
No thoughts on that, sorry.	Adwene biara nni ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho, kyɛw.
Stay as long as you want.	Tra hɔ bere tenten a wopɛ.
Such is the nature of man.	Onipa su te saa.
Where does this lead?	Ɛhe na eyi de kɔ?
I knew he once was.	Ná minim sɛ bere bi na ɔyɛ saa.
He feels that someone is in the way.	Ɔte nka sɛ obi wɔ ɔkwan no so.
That’s too powerful.	Ɛno yɛ tumi dodo.
That would be nice.	Ɛno bɛyɛ fɛ.
Many people still remember those horrors.	Nnipa pii da so ara kae saa nsɛm a ɛyɛ hu no.
It wasn’t my money, though, and it was what he wanted.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ me sika, na na ɛyɛ nea na ɔpɛ.
There was no one else in town.	Ná obi foforo biara nni kurow no mu.
You don’t want to do this.	Wompɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi.
What is the right thing to do?	Dɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ?
Work with him.	Wo ne no nyɛ adwuma.
It was as if.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea.
He was obviously in pain.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔte yaw.
It shouldn’t be that hard.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den saa.
Look at the picture.	Hwɛ mfonini no.
Will this work?.	So eyi bɛyɛ adwuma?.
However, they need to act quickly.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ade ntɛmntɛm.
Be careful!	Hwɛ yiye!
It is a very exciting time.	Ɛyɛ bere a anigye kɛse wom.
Just like this here.	Te sɛ eyi ara pɛ wɔ ha.
And it works really well.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
I get to know my father and myself better.	Mihu me papa ne me ho yiye.
Or maybe you.	Anaasɛ ebia wo.
That would be a lie.	Ɛno bɛyɛ atoro.
It’s not a good thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade pa.
And it wasn’t anything like that.	Na ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
Neither attempt was successful.	Mmɔden abien no mu biara antumi ankɔ yiye.
But, tell you what is there.	Nanso, ka nea ɛwɔ hɔ kyerɛ wo.
His eyes didn’t see anything.	N’ani anhu hwee.
I am getting bigger now.	Mereyɛ kɛse mprempren.
I go when it’s cold.	Mekɔ bere a awɔw ayɛ no.
It’s just too big.	Ɛyɛ kɛse dodo ara kwa.
Use this as much as you can.	Fa eyi di dwuma sɛnea wubetumi.
Everything else just comes wonderfully for me.	Biribiara a aka no ba ara kwa ma ɛyɛ nwonwa ma me.
We would do the same.	Ná yɛn nso yɛbɛyɛ saa ara.
That room looks great.	Saa dan no hwɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
But again I was wrong.	Nanso bio na meyɛ mfomso.
She should be happy and content, and she had been this morning.	Ɛsɛ sɛ n’ani gye na n’ani gye, na na wayɛ saa anɔpa yi.
You are in control, not them.	Wo na wowɔ tumi, ɛnyɛ wɔn.
But there are problems with this strategy.	Nanso ɔhaw ahorow wɔ saa ɔkwan yi ho.
At least he was gone.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na onni hɔ bio.
Look at me, mom.	Hwɛ me, maame.
I’m glad it’s over.	M’ani agye sɛ aba awiei.
Everyone is very excited about this.	Obiara ani gye eyi ho yiye.
Make sure all ingredients are at room temperature.	Hwɛ hu sɛ nneɛma a wode bɛyɛ aduan no nyinaa wɔ dan mu hyew mu.
It wasn’t fun.	Ná ɛnyɛ anigye.
It’s the best of the best.	Ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
I’m excited about that.	M’ani agye saa asɛm no ho.
It was in my eyes.	Ná ɛwɔ m’ani so.
I hope we have some similar interests.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ yɛwɔ nneɛma bi a ɛte saa ara a yɛn ani gye ho.
But in two cases we have a lot of luck.	Nanso wɔ nsɛm abien mu no yɛwɔ anigye pii.
Easy for the users.	Ɛnyɛ den mma wɔn a wɔde di dwuma no.
All of these issues seem impossible to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea nsɛm yi nyinaa ntumi nyɛ yiye mma me.
You can play the game.	Wubetumi adi agoru.
I know it’s hard, but it’s what we have to do.	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ den, nanso ɛyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
I have a lot to think about.	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
The kids were painting a picture.	Ná mmofra no reyɛ mfonini bi.
It felt painful.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ yaw.
The problem was how.	Ná ɔhaw no ne sɛnea.
What is the right thing to do.	Dɛn ne ade a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
You have to want to be good.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ papa.
Not both of us.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa.
The car got some goodies.	Kar no nyaa nneɛma pa bi.
Besides, it will be just us being there.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɛbɛyɛ yɛn a yɛwɔ hɔ ara kwa.
Everything worked fine but the game.	Biribiara yɛɛ adwuma yiye nanso agoru no.
I think it’s great at night.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse anadwo.
We do the whole thing ourselves.	Yɛn ankasa yɛ ade mũ no nyinaa.
It’s still here.	Ɛda so ara wɔ ha.
This guy looks like trouble.	Saa ɔbarima yi te sɛ ɔhaw.
He is a good man.	Ɔyɛ onipa pa.
If it works, it’s great.	Sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a, ɛyɛ kɛse.
Treat them well.	Fa wɔn di no yiye.
It was the most amazing thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen biara.
The danger here is psychological.	Asiane a ɛwɔ ha no yɛ adwene mu de.
What a thrilling story!	Asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye bɛn ara ni!
You look even more like him now, with your hair like that.	Wo ho te sɛ no kɛse mpo mprempren, a wo ti nhwi te saa.
That is a fact of life.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nokware.
Hope you get well soon.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wo ho bɛtɔ wo ntɛmntɛm.
He put his hand on his head.	Ɔde ne nsa too ne ti so.
He knows where his hands have to go.	Onim baabi a ɛsɛ sɛ ne nsa kɔ.
It was cold last year.	Ná awɔw wom afe a etwaam no.
This is a beautiful dress.	Eyi yɛ atade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Just be sure to tell her she’s beautiful.	Hwɛ hu ara sɛ wobɛka akyerɛ no sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
But that nothing is okay.	Nanso sɛ biribiara nyɛ hwee.
How can I check this.	Mɛyɛ dɛn ahwɛ eyi mu.
He had no intention of doing so.	Ná ɔnyɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
But he could do it with the money.	Nanso na obetumi de sika no ayɛ.
But he had a point.	Nanso na ɔwɔ asɛm bi.
There is a reason for this.	Nea enti a ɛte saa wɔ hɔ.
Tell him whatever you think is best.	Ka nea wususuw sɛ eye biara kyerɛ no.
It was a pleasure.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye.
However, it seems like it will never work out then.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye da saa bere no.
We in this room.	Yɛn a yɛwɔ saa dan yi mu.
Really, really bad.	Ankasa, bɔne ankasa.
They are really cheap.	Wɔn bo yɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
There is no music.	Nnwom biara nni hɔ.
It’s just that, so .	Ɛyɛ saa ara, enti .
The issue is complicated.	Asɛm no mu yɛ den.
And you’re on it.	Na wowɔ so.
I love these people.	M’ani gye saa nnipa yi ho.
He wrapped his arms around her.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne mu.
But he doesn’t like it.	Nanso n’ani nnye ho.
That can really cause a lot of problems.	Ɛno betumi de ɔhaw pii aba ankasa.
Look at that picture again, right?	Hwɛ saa mfonini no bio, ɛnte saa?
We looked at each other.	Yɛn ani kyerɛɛ yɛn ho yɛn ho.
That time has passed.	Saa bere no atwam.
It feels so much fun for them.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ anigye kɛse ma wɔn.
It’s someone else.	Ɛyɛ obi foforo.
He did, you know.	Ɔyɛɛ saa, wunim.
Tell yourself you don’t want that food.	Ka kyerɛ wo ho sɛ wompɛ saa aduan no.
There's a reason you don't know my real name.	Ade bi wɔ hɔ a enti wunnim me din ankasa.
It didn’t matter to them.	Ná ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm.
At least we have something to say this time.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yɛwɔ biribi ka saa bere yi.
I wish the summer would come.	Me yam a anka awɔw bere no bɛba.
I have a lot of books.	Mewɔ nhoma pii.
But that’s a good idea.	Nanso ɛno yɛ adwene pa.
This just happened inside him.	Eyi sii wɔ ne mu ara kwa.
It was me who had a problem.	Ɛyɛ me na na ɔwɔ ɔhaw bi.
I can’t do it.	Mintumi nyɛ.
Still, this night was fun.	Nanso, na anadwo yi yɛ anigye.
There is nothing to see here.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ahu wɔ ha.
But it might have been fun to bring him there.	Nanso ebia na ɛyɛ anigye sɛ mede no bɛba hɔ.
He slammed his hand against the door.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ɔpon no so.
You are mature for your age.	Wo ho akokwaw ma wo mfe.
Maybe you remember him.	Ebia wokae no.
It was movie night.	Ná ɛyɛ sini anadwo.
Look at what you do.	Hwɛ nea woyɛ.
However, this is a completely marginal opportunity.	Nanso, eyi yɛ hokwan a ɛwɔ akyi koraa.
He was worried about her.	Ná ne ho asɛm haw no.
However, you would have to do it a little differently.	Nanso, anka ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no ɔkwan foforo kakra so.
But back to my comments.	Nanso san kɔ me nsɛm no so.
There are no other pictures either.	Mfonini foforo biara nso nni hɔ.
It’s just not that easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa kɛkɛ.
Everyone will in the same situation.	Obiara bɛyɛ wɔ tebea koro no ara mu.
I knew he had forgotten my father too.	Ná minim sɛ ɔno nso werɛ afi me papa.
No one saw him.	Obiara anhu no.
Water was scarce.	Ná nsu ho yɛ na.
Many people visit the city every day.	Nnipa pii kɔ kurow no mu da biara.
So you treat us that way.	Enti wo ne yɛn di saa.
It was a mistake.	Ná ɛyɛ mfomso.
So you can start making one.	Enti wubetumi afi ase ayɛ biako.
And they really enjoyed it.	Na wɔn ani gyee ho ampa.
Do you know where the moon goes at night?	Wunim baabi a ɔsram kɔ ​​anadwo?
And I’m so excited about it.	Na m’ani gye ho kɛse.
I see two reasons for this result.	Mihu nneɛma abien nti na nea afi mu aba yi aba.
They told him that it was all right.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ, na ɛyɛ yiye.
He didn't have to say anything.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔka biribiara.
The door closed.	Ɔpon no too mu.
Maybe he didn’t need to be here for this.	Ebia na enhia sɛ ɔwɔ ha ma eyi.
They are, by their very nature, fragile.	Wɔyɛ, sɛnea wɔn su ankasa no, wɔyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I am in great shape.	Mewɔ tebea kɛse mu.
He’s interested in it.	N’ani gye ho.
His hand felt warm against hers.	Ne nsa tee nka sɛ ɛyɛ hyew wɔ ne nsa ho.
Already, he wanted her back.	Dedaw no, na ɔpɛ no bio.
In your hands, however, it is safe.	Nanso, wɔ wo nsa so no, asiane biara nni ho.
And it was great, you know.	Na na ɛyɛ kɛse, wunim.
You like to plan.	W’ani gye ho sɛ wobɛyɛ nhyehyɛe.
This was something else.	Ná eyi yɛ ade foforo.
It doesn’t feel wrong.	Ɛnte nka sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
There is something for all ages.	Biribi wɔ hɔ ma mfe nyinaa.
Fill the container with fresh water.	Fa nsu pa hyɛ ade no mu ma.
I made up my mind.	Meyɛɛ m’adwene.
I am sure you know these things.	Migye di sɛ wunim saa nneɛma yi.
However, there are cases where this is clearly not true.	Nanso, nsɛm bi wɔ hɔ a ɛda adi sɛ eyi nyɛ nokware.
Put your hand in my hand.	Fa wo nsa hyɛ me nsa mu.
I think they shouldn’t.	Misusuw sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
He seems to like it.	Ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye ho.
However, it is very difficult.	Nanso, ɛyɛ den yiye.
They were happy for him as a person.	Ná wɔn ani gye ma no sɛ onipa.
You can get help faster than ever before.	Wubetumi anya mmoa ntɛm sen bere a atwam no.
In any case, it is not.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛnyɛ saa.
He arranged the arrangement.	Ɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛe no ho nhyehyɛe.
None of them are in the story.	Wɔn mu biara nni asɛm no mu.
It doesn’t exist.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ.
Why does no one help us?	Dɛn nti na obiara mmoa yɛn?
It pains me to say that, but it’s true.	Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ meka saa, nanso ɛyɛ nokware.
Hope that sounds like fun.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno te sɛ anigye.
But this is not that day.	Nanso eyi nyɛ saa da no.
It was just them or me.	Ná ɛyɛ wɔn anaa me ara kwa.
You have one, too.	Wo nso wowɔ bi.
He treated her like a child.	Ɔne no dii sɛ abofra.
You have to take advantage of that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode saa hokwan no di dwuma.
The next best thing.	Ade a edi hɔ a eye sen biara.
You have to believe me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye me di.
I think he has done that.	Misusuw sɛ wayɛ saa.
He didn't know what plan.	Ná onnim nhyehyɛe bɛn.
I know the way.	Minim ɔkwan no.
He slammed my hand down.	Ɔde me nsa bɔɔ fam.
Besides, the past is past.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, nea atwam no atwam.
He is in good shape.	Ɔwɔ tebea pa mu.
That surprised him.	Ɛno maa ne ho dwiriw no.
All necessary tests should be carried out.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow a ɛho hia nyinaa.
Everyone there knew him.	Ná obiara a ɔwɔ hɔ no nim no.
Suppose we have and .	Fa no sɛ yɛwɔ na .
It’s not fun.	Ɛnyɛ anigye.
But he had nothing.	Nanso na onni hwee.
It’s really scary with a name.	Ɛyɛ hu a ɛwɔ din ankasa.
This is a difficult time.	Eyi yɛ bere a ɛyɛ den.
She was his wife, after all.	Ná ɔyɛ ne yere, ne nyinaa akyi no.
He has every right to do so.	Ɔwɔ hokwan biara sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I can work with that.	Metumi de saa ayɛ adwuma.
If you have one, you’re lucky.	Sɛ wowɔ bi a, w’ani agye.
He didn’t have much time.	Ná onni bere pii.
You just have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa ara kwa.
This could be a week or two.	Eyi betumi ayɛ dapɛn biako anaa abien.
Most successful businesses innovate.	Nnwuma dodow no ara a edi yiye no yɛ nneɛma foforo.
Some languages ​​are more oral.	Kasa ahorow bi yɛ nea wɔde ano ka kɛse.
There are two other important factors.	Nneɛma abien foforo a ɛho hia wɔ hɔ.
I’m glad I don’t know.	M’ani gye ho sɛ minnim.
Good for both of them.	Eye ma wɔn baanu nyinaa.
This will bring up everything.	Eyi bɛma biribiara a ɛwɔ hɔ no aba.
If not now, when?.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ mprempren a, bere bɛn?.
This is the only one.	Eyi nkutoo ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ.
Probably better than you know yourself.	Ebia eye sen sɛnea wunim wo ho.
The man hit the child.	Ɔbarima no bɔɔ abofra no.
One last day on my desk, until next time.	Da koro a etwa to wɔ me pon so, kosi bere foforo.
But it’s a bit more complicated.	Nanso ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den kakra.
Which is what it is today.	Nea ɛyɛ nnɛ.
His head fell to the ground.	Ne ti hwee fam.
And a lot of crying.	Na su pii.
No one can hear us here.	Obiara ntumi nte yɛn wɔ ha.
He knew the city could not go this way.	Ná onim sɛ kurow no ntumi nkɔ saa kwan yi so.
Get rid of that hand!	Yi saa nsa no fi hɔ!
I am surprised at you.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa wɔ wo ho.
Does the child see that?	So abofra no hu saa?
It was a job he really seemed to enjoy.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye ho ankasa.
It was the last game of the season.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a etwa to wɔ afe no mu.
It’s the ultimate pleasure.	Ɛyɛ anigye a etwa to.
Good job they do.	Adwuma pa a wɔyɛ.
One more night.	Anadwo biako bio.
It was easy.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
No one said anything to him.	Obiara anka hwee ankyerɛ no.
This power is in every human being.	Saa tumi yi wɔ onipa biara mu.
And no one tells anyone.	Na obiara nkyerɛ obiara.
He is good to me too.	Ɔyɛ me nso yiye.
The story he tells is an important one.	Asɛm a ɔka no yɛ asɛm a ɛho hia.
He was the first.	Ɔno na na odi kan.
I don’t think that works for them.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ adwuma ma wɔn.
Everyone does that.	Obiara yɛ saa.
So much going on here.	Enti nneɛma pii rekɔ so wɔ ha.
This is not very exciting.	Eyi nyɛ anigye kɛse.
I found the story.	Mihuu asɛm no.
Your speech is very important.	Wo kasa no yɛ nea ɛho hia kɛse.
This issue is too complicated.	Saa asɛm yi yɛ den dodo.
He doesn’t want money.	Ɔmpɛ sika.
Either way, it’s kind of interesting.	Ɔkwan biara so no, ɛyɛ anigye bi.
Be very careful.	Hwɛ yiye paa.
You know where everything is.	Wunim baabi a biribiara wɔ.
Everyone was very focused.	Ná obiara de n’adwene asi biribi so yiye.
He ran into the room.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ dan no mu.
Return.	San.
I felt he understood the point.	Metee nka sɛ ɔte asɛm no ase.
They are both happy.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa ani agye.
Their work was very successful.	Wɔn adwuma no dii yiye paa.
We were there around the same time.	Ná yɛwɔ hɔ bɛyɛ bere koro no ara mu.
There are mistakes.	Mfomso ahorow wɔ hɔ.
The thing is not possible.	Ade no ntumi nyɛ yiye.
I know that very well.	Minim saa yiye.
Maybe one day it would.	Ebia da koro bi anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I'm really sorry.	Mepa wo kyɛw ankasa.
Everything has to be in order.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribiara yɛ ne kwan so.
These transfer services are free, easy and quick.	Wɔyɛ saa nnwuma a wɔde kɔ baabi foforo yi kwa, ɛnyɛ den na ɛyɛ ntɛm.
How can this be achieved?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na eyi betumi ayɛ yiye?
And it’s still going on.	Na ɛda so ara kɔ so.
I'll talk about it here.	Meka ho asɛm wɔ ha.
They are all still afraid.	Wɔn nyinaa da so ara suro.
They were perfect.	Ná wɔyɛ pɛ.
It’s pretty definitely that.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛte saa.
At the time, it seemed like a great deal.	Saa bere no, na ɛte sɛ ade kɛse.
Somehow he knew.	Ɔkwan bi so no na onim.
Thank you for setting me up in the master bedroom.	Meda wo ase sɛ wode me sii hɔ wɔ mpa kɛse no mu.
This system also has its problems.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi nso wɔ ne haw ahorow.
They are a very intelligent species.	Wɔyɛ mmoa ahorow a wɔn nyansa wom yiye.
And it’s always good.	Na ɛyɛ papa bere nyinaa.
The police were outside and so was their gun.	Ná polisifo no wɔ abɔnten na saa ara na na wɔn tuo no nso te.
I don’t know if we can win.	Minnim sɛ ebia yebetumi adi nkonim anaa.
And you can’t take this for granted.	Na worentumi mfa eyi nyɛ hwee.
There is no doubt about that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho wɔ ɛno ho.
Tell them what happened.	Ka nea esii no kyerɛ wɔn.
No ma na fa.	No ma na fa.
I see someone who is very unattractive.	Mihu obi a ne ho nyɛ fɛ koraa.
He dropped her to the ground.	Ɔde no too fam.
Many people are unemployed.	Nnipa pii nni adwuma.
Don’t care what it is.	Mma nea ɛyɛ no mfa ho.
Doing what you want.	Nea wopɛ a wobɛyɛ.
I can hardly believe it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nnye nni.
People often want food to be quick.	Nkurɔfo taa pɛ sɛ aduan yɛ ntɛm.
We seem to have a lot in common.	Ɛte sɛ nea yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ pɛ.
The chapter is usually the hardest for me.	Ti no taa yɛ nea ɛyɛ den ma me sen biara.
It’s not just in him.	Ɛnyɛ ne mu ara kwa.
He should never have brought her here.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔde no ba ha da.
Do whatever you have to do.	Yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biara.
There is only one downside.	Ade bɔne biako pɛ na ɛwɔ ho.
He speaks many languages ​​fluently.	Ɔka kasa ahorow pii yiye.
The highway is dangerous at night.	Ɔkwan kɛse no so yɛ hu anadwo.
Help is possible.	Mmoa betumi aba.
That’s what the team is doing.	Ɛno ne nea kuw no reyɛ.
No one can tell him what to do.	Obiara ntumi nkyerɛ no nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
Both of those are really the same thing.	Saa nneɛma abien no nyinaa yɛ ade koro ankasa.
And most of us did .	Na yɛn mu dodow no ara yɛɛ saa .
It is very important to them.	Ɛho hia wɔn paa.
He knew your name.	Ná onim wo din.
Your children know.	Wo mma nim.
For the first time in three years.	Nea edi kan wɔ mfe abiɛsa mu.
It looks pretty cool.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
My real name.	Me din ankasa.
It’s good to be good.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ papa.
He patted his head.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne ti so.
That’s not their mother’s fault.	Ɛno nyɛ wɔn maame mfomso.
So does his wife.	Saa ara na ne yere nso yɛ.
This task is simple enough.	Saa adwuma yi yɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He is there.	Ɔwɔ hɔ.
He was strong and strong again.	Ná ne ho yɛ den na na ne ho yɛ den bio.
What a good man you are.	Ɔbarima pa bɛn ara na woyɛ.
This is not entirely true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
It was too weird.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa dodo.
I missed them so much and they missed me.	Me werɛ fii wɔn kɛse na wɔn nso me werɛ fii me.
I'm pretty sure he shouldn't.	Migye di yiye sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
And it wasn’t the first time.	Na ɛnyɛ nea edi kan.
It’s important to me.	Ɛho hia me.
He wasn’t doing that.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa.
But it didn’t matter then.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ hwee saa bere no.
But something was completely wrong.	Nanso na biribi anyɛ yiye koraa.
Meanwhile the mind behind everything reveals its ultimate plan.	Saa bere yi nyinaa adwene a ɛwɔ biribiara akyi no da ne nhyehyɛe a etwa to no adi.
This is a great job.	Eyi yɛ adwuma kɛse.
This doesn’t have to happen for you.	Ɛho nhia sɛ eyi bɛba ama wo.
It’s a great one.	Ɛyɛ kɛse.
He has many friends.	Ɔwɔ nnamfo pii.
I get that.	Me nsa ka saa.
I’m not afraid of myself.	M’ani nnye me ho.
The year is over.	Afe no aba awiei.
Everyone has an equal right to it.	Obiara wɔ hokwan a ɛyɛ pɛ wɔ ho.
They are as good at their job as anyone else.	Wɔn ho akokwaw wɔ wɔn adwuma mu te sɛ obi foforo.
Don't get caught out of this.	Mma wo nkɔ mu mfi eyi mu.
It’s pretty cool though.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye nanso.
The objects were people.	Ná nneɛma a wɔde yɛ nneɛma no yɛ nnipa.
He didn't know why.	Ná onnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Please, just a moment!	Mesrɛ wo, bere tiaa bi!
And cheap power, at that.	Na tumi a ne bo yɛ mmerɛw, wɔ saa bere no mu.
Glad to have you.	Anigye sɛ yɛwɔ wo.
I was there at the time.	Saa bere no na mewɔ hɔ.
Don't tell me you don't know how the system works.	Nka nkyerɛ me sɛ wunnim sɛnea nhyehyɛe no yɛ adwuma.
Their real names.	Wɔn din ankasa.
Let’s hope you might like it.	Momma yɛn anidaso sɛ ebia w’ani begye ho.
The mind was full of hope.	Ná anidaso ahyɛ adwene no ma.
They do well here.	Wɔyɛ yiye wɔ ha.
In a game.	Wɔ agoru bi mu.
We don’t like it.	Yɛn ani nnye ho.
But he had no idea why this was so.	Nanso na onni nea enti a eyi te saa no ho adwene biara.
The team won a game.	Kuw no dii nkonim wɔ agoru bi mu.
It hasn’t always been easy.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ayɛ mmerɛw.
I am sorry about that.	Ɛyɛ me yaw wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
For most, that may seem like the end of the story.	Wɔ dodow no ara fam no, ebia ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛno ne asɛm no awiei.
He was imprisoned.	Wɔde no too afiase.
My kids have always loved animals.	Me mma ani gye mmoa ho bere nyinaa.
He is no longer a child.	Ɔnyɛ abofra bio.
He made himself look good.	Ɔyɛɛ ne ho yiye.
I have another opportunity.	Mewɔ hokwan foforo.
The final comments are similar.	Nsɛm a etwa to a wɔka no nso te saa ara.
The dress is very expensive.	Atade no bo yɛ den yiye.
He gave it to me.	Ɔde maa me.
You just say that it is.	Woka kɛkɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
The rumors are going on.	Nsɛm a wɔka no rekɔ so.
It’s really simple.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
What he would have said.	Nea anka ɔbɛka.
However, this is not the case at all.	Nanso, eyi nte saa koraa.
He also made a lot of money.	Ɔyɛɛ sika pii nso.
I wonder what you think about it.	Misusuw nea wususuw wɔ ho no ho.
We have much more to do.	Yɛwɔ pii sen saa a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
A little more hope.	Anidaso kakra ka ho.
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
So we will focus on just one method.	Enti yɛde yɛn adwene besi ɔkwan biako pɛ so.
Many people attended the meeting.	Nnipa pii baa nhyiam no ase.
Nothing ever happened.	Biribiara anyɛ da.
No wonder the book was so popular.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ na nhoma no agye din saa.
The child enjoyed the work.	Abofra no ani gyee adwuma no ho.
It will be a very important point in the present paper.	Ɛbɛyɛ asɛm a ɛho hia yiye wɔ mprempren krataa yi mu.
You must sign this form.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo nsa hyɛ krataa yi ase.
Who doesn’t paint these days?	Hena na ɔnyɛ mfonini nnansa yi?
I felt like I couldn’t sleep.	Ná mete nka sɛ nna mintumi nna.
It doesn’t.	Ɛyɛ saa.
But we do.	Nanso yɛ.
All that matters is here and now.	Nea ɛho hia ara ne ha ne mprempren.
You.	Wo.
He had turned him over to them.	Ná ɔde no ahyɛ wɔn nsa.
I guess he doesn’t want to tell me.	Misusuw sɛ ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ me.
That is not an easy task.	Ɛno nyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
So many wonderful friends.	Enti nnamfo a wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa pii.
Tom wasn't really there.	Ná Tom nni hɔ ankasa.
I was big time.	Ná meyɛ bere kɛse.
No one is really happy living in the city.	Obiara nni hɔ a n’ani gye ankasa sɛ ɔte kurow no mu.
After a while the dog returned home.	Bere bi akyi no, ɔkraman no san kɔɔ fie.
He knew he wasn't wrong about this.	Ná onim sɛ onni mfomso wɔ eyi ho.
So, the story is true.	Enti, asɛm no yɛ nokware.
He is alone in bed.	Ɔno nkutoo da mpa so.
He was a cute kid, but his cuteness wasn’t good.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra a ne ho yɛ fɛ, nanso na ne ho yɛ fɛ no nyɛ papa.
This was very difficult for me.	Ná eyi yɛ den yiye ma me.
And what he doesn’t isn’t very pretty indeed.	Na nea ɔnyɛ no nyɛ fɛ kɛse ampa.
That’s not so clear.	Ɛno mu nna hɔ saa.
I saw someone on the street.	Mihuu obi wɔ abɔnten so.
They are interested in that.	Wɔn ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
Sure, you can see that easily.	Ampa, wubetumi ahu saa a ɛnyɛ den.
This is the rest of his life.	Eyi ne ne nkwa nna a aka no.
It’s usually busy, so plan early.	Mpɛn pii no, adagyew nnim, enti yɛ nhyehyɛe ntɛm.
Only measurements are in short supply.	Nneɛma a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho nkutoo na ɛho ayɛ na.
How similar it is to me.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛte saa ara ma me.
The door is the entrance to the house.	Ɔpon no yɛ ofie no ano.
He is one of them, too.	Ɔno nso yɛ wɔn mu biako.
This often involved two processes.	Ná eyi taa fa nneɛma abien a wɔyɛ ho.
You have a lot of resources.	Wowɔ nneɛma pii a wode bɛyɛ adwuma.
They just sleep at home.	Wɔn fie nna ara kwa.
You should have seen him.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no.
This is not new there.	Eyi nyɛ ade foforo wɔ hɔ.
He lives near here.	Ɔte bɛn ha.
No sex for anyone.	Nna biara nni hɔ mma obiara.
Which will be soon.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ nnansa yi ara.
He almost had it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɔwɔ bi.
The point is, you need to know how.	Asɛm no ne sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu sɛnea wobɛyɛ.
Certainly not tonight.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ anadwo yi.
That’s a great thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade kɛse.
You have to sign it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ mu de wo nsa hyɛ ase.
But you have something far more powerful.	Nanso wowɔ biribi a tumi wom sen saa koraa.
This should not happen again.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi ba bio.
He is good at solving the problems.	Ɔyɛ obi a onim ɔhaw ahorow no ho dwuma yiye.
And he certainly knew where he was.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na onim baabi a ɔwɔ.
I’m so happy to be here with you.	M’ani agye paa sɛ me ne mo wɔ ha.
It’s my really nice car.	Ɛyɛ me kar a ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
That was like a painting.	Ná ɛno te sɛ mfonini bi.
It’s that simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
Wrong, in my opinion.	Mfomso, wɔ m’adwene mu.
Pie you.	Pii sii.
Partly because he was.	Ne fã bi ne sɛ na ɔte saa.
It was a weeknight.	Ná ɛyɛ dapɛn biako anadwo.
No head and no legs.	Ti ne nan biara nni mu.
If you believe it is good.	Sɛ wugye di sɛ eye.
You know yourself better than anyone else.	Wunim wo ho yiye sen obiara.
I'm better at that than he is.	Me ho akokwaw wɔ saa ade no mu sen ɔno.
He wants nothing more than to be with her.	Ɔmpɛ hwee sɛ ɔne no bɛbɔ.
You need to know this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu eyi.
But he didn’t know.	Nanso na onnim.
This is our number one priority.	Eyi ne ade a edi kan a yɛde di kan koraa.
Not really, but it felt like it.	Ɛnyɛ ankasa, nanso na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
I just can’t say it.	Mintumi nka kɛkɛ.
I knew that.	Ná minim saa.
And something else.	Na biribi foforo nso.
He was not in school today.	Ná onni sukuu mu nnɛ.
That is terrible.	Ɛno yɛ hu yiye.
But those people are wrong.	Nanso saa nkurɔfo no di mfomso.
The day was already getting late.	Ná da no rekɔ anwummere dedaw.
But what they used is very, very graphic.	Nanso nea wɔde dii dwuma no yɛ mfonini kɛse, kɛse.
That statement is not true.	Saa asɛm no nyɛ nokware.
Show that you want a child.	Kyerɛ sɛ wopɛ abofra.
He is not a liar.	Ɔnyɛ atoro.
He lacked a single attractive trait or quality.	Ná onni su anaa su biako mpo a ɛyɛ fɛ.
This gave me a floor.	Eyi maa me fam.
But the story has a happy ending.	Nanso asɛm no wɔ awiei a ɛyɛ anigye.
All the resources are available, free of charge, to everyone.	Nneɛma no nyinaa wɔ hɔ, kwa, ma obiara.
Our son is now at a very wonderful age.	Mprempren yɛn ba no adi mfe a ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
It definitely works.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
All schools should do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ sukuu ahorow nyinaa yɛ saa.
Has this ever happened?	So eyi asi pɛn?
I actually had a problem with this.	Ná mewɔ ɔhaw bi wɔ eyi ho ankasa.
You know it’s true.	Wunim sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
The plan failed.	Nhyehyɛe no antumi anyɛ yiye.
Fast and quick!	Fa ntɛmntɛm na fa ntɛm!
I have no time for myself.	Minni bere biara mma me ho.
Treat them that way.	Fa wɔn di saa.
It’s even less likely.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛnyɛ yiye mpo.
However, there is one problem.	Nanso, ɔhaw biako wɔ hɔ.
There wasn’t much in it, but there was something.	Ná nneɛma pii nni mu, nanso na biribi wɔ hɔ.
Water is important, but not as important as food.	Nsu ho hia, nanso ɛho nhia te sɛ aduan.
He worked with my father.	Ɔne me papa yɛɛ adwuma.
Food is the real problem.	Aduan ne ɔhaw ankasa.
Which is the point.	Nea ɛyɛ asɛm no.
Nothing for him but walking.	Biribiara nni hɔ mma no gye sɛ nantew.
You can’t imagine how hard it was.	Worentumi nsusuw sɛnea na ɛyɛ den no ho.
And no one said a word.	Na obiara anka asɛm biara.
A lot of music works like that.	Nnwom pii yɛ adwuma saa.
I can’t see him.	Mintumi nhu no.
The music was too loud.	Ná nnwom no ano yɛ den dodo.
I don’t know how to tell you what happened.	Minnim sɛnea mɛka nea esii no akyerɛ wo.
But there is something he did about.	Nanso biribi wɔ hɔ a ɔyɛɛ ho biribi.
He may have done this.	Ebia na wayɛ eyi.
I’d love to work in that style as well.	M’ani begye ho sɛ mɛyɛ adwuma wɔ saa ɔkwan no so nso.
You will do what you want anyway.	Wobɛyɛ nea wopɛ ɔkwan biara so.
No one should come here.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara ba ha.
The kids are still playing.	Mmofra no da so ara di agoru.
Like, all of it.	Te sɛ, ne nyinaa.
Even then, it doesn’t have to be.	Saa bere no mpo, enhia sɛ ɛte saa.
He put me on the phone.	Ɔde me too telefon so.
However, there are important problems with this approach.	Nanso, ɔhaw ahorow a ɛho hia wɔ saa kwan yi ho.
Remember what he did for you.	Kae nea ɔyɛ maa wo no.
But we both took it.	Nanso yɛn baanu nyinaa faa no.
Sleep well kids.	Da yiye mmofra.
All in all, it’s pretty cool.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I want to see the size of the whole thing.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu ade mũ no nyinaa kɛse no.
I want them to be happy, surprised.	Mepɛ sɛ wɔn ani gye, wɔn ho dwiriw wɔn.
Always check, recheck.	Bere nyinaa hwɛ, san hwɛ.
The risk is very, very unequal.	Asiane no nyɛ pɛ koraa, koraa.
I barely knew what to do.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na minnim nea mɛyɛ.
And most of my friends.	Na me nnamfo dodow no ara nso.
I feel like every song has it.	Mete nka sɛ dwom biara wɔ bi.
Check out the final product today.	Hwɛ ade a etwa to no nnɛ.
Like this one?	Te sɛ eyi?
There is, even that.	Ɛwɔ hɔ, saa mpo.
There were surprisingly few.	Ná kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
For how long.	Bere tenten bɛn.
But that was my only hope.	Nanso na ɛno nkutoo ne anidaso a mewɔ.
What works on one doesn’t always work on another.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na nea ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ biako so no yɛ adwuma wɔ foforo so.
I could have controlled myself better.	Anka metumi adi me ho so yiye.
The same is true in the mind.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ adwene mu.
I would do anything for them.	Anka mɛyɛ biribiara ama wɔn.
That would be awesome and convenient.	Ɛno bɛyɛ hu na ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
And that means a lot to me.	Na ɛno kyerɛ pii ma me.
No one even knew it existed.	Ná obiara nnim mpo sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
You both love the outdoors.	Mo baanu nyinaa ani gye abɔnten so ho.
I don’t want you to think that.	Mempɛ sɛ wususuw saa.
The same should be true here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ saa ara na ɛte wɔ ha nso.
But this game was amazing.	Nanso na agoru yi yɛ nwonwa.
It may be of interest to you.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ wo anigye.
Nobody wants him.	Obiara mpɛ no.
They are far too dangerous.	Wɔyɛ asiane dodo koraa.
That is not the interesting point.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
He walked down the road.	Ɔde nantew faa kwan so.
Like the beast.	Te sɛ aboa no.
The room was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ dan no mu ma.
Not anymore now, not even him.	Ɛnyɛ saa bio mprempren, ɔno mpo.
I was in his mind.	Ná mewɔ n’adwene mu.
It wasn’t, but something was going on.	Na ɛnte saa, nanso na biribi rekɔ so.
He runs his hands through his hair.	Ɔde ne nsa tu mmirika fa ne ti nhwi mu.
Follow it carefully.	Di akyi yiye.
He may be the only one.	Ebia ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
This may take some time.	Ebia eyi begye bere kakra.
His eyes were still on mine.	Ná n’ani da so ara yɛ me de no.
Otherwise, great book.	Anyɛ saa a, nhoma kɛse.
My father knows the way.	Me papa nim ɔkwan no.
There is a serious problem going on.	Ɔhaw kɛse bi rekɔ so.
There was something else out there.	Na biribi foforo nso wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
I am on the road now.	Mewɔ kwan so mprempren.
Or that’s what she always thought.	Anaasɛ ɛno ne nea na osusuw ho bere nyinaa.
Are you there.	Wowɔ hɔ.
He had worked long hours.	Ná wayɛ adwuma nnɔnhwerew pii.
Usually, he played some years and did well.	Mpɛn pii no, na ɔbɔ mfe bi na ɔyɛɛ yiye.
Somehow or another, your cops don’t want you.	Wɔ ɔkwan bi so anaa ɔkwan bi so no, wo polisifo no mpɛ wo.
That was a complete mistake.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfomso koraa.
It’s too powerful, too dangerous.	Ɛyɛ tumi dodo, asiane wom dodo.
I didn’t want to be here.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mewɔ ha.
You’ve done a good job.	Woayɛ papa.
Thank you mom.	Meda wo ase maame.
It didn’t look anything like me.	Na ɛnte sɛ me ho hwee.
Good news though.	Asɛm pa de, nanso.
While that may not have been true before, it is now.	Bere a ebia na ɛno nyɛ nokware kan no, ɛte saa mprempren.
He would have done the same in a similar situation.	Anka ɔno nso bɛyɛ saa ara wɔ tebea a ɛte saa ara mu.
But it wasn’t really him.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɔno ankasa.
The car veered off the road.	Kar no dan fii kwan no so.
We both used to do that.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛ saa.
You can do these things.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa nneɛma yi.
They both seem very happy.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔn baanu nyinaa ani agye yiye.
Just look at yourself.	Hwɛ wo ho ara kwa.
No one wants that!.	Obiara mpɛ saa!.
Summer is my time to play.	Awɔw bere ne bere a mede di agoru.
I really, really missed it.	Me werɛ fii no ankasa, ankasa.
Just keep going.	Kɔ so ara kɛkɛ.
I'm bringing it.	Mede ba.
Alright.	Ɛyɛ.
No one knew.	Ná obiara nnim.
Some of his ideas were really good.	Ná n’adwene no bi yɛ papa ankasa.
That’s the down side of this job.	Ɛno ne adwuma yi fã a ɛwɔ fam.
Let’s have fun!	Momma mo ani nnye!
That’s his name.	Ɛno ne ne din.
You do a lot of otherwise.	Woyɛ pii a ɛnte saa.
What a first day.	Da a edi kan bɛn ara ni.
He can if he wants to.	Obetumi sɛ ɔpɛ a.
Go there, say this, pretend.	Kɔ hɔ, ka eyi, yɛ wo ho sɛ woreyɛ saa.
Maybe he was there at one time.	Ebia na ɔwɔ hɔ bere bi.
A warm bedroom.	Mpa a ɛyɛ hyew.
It was really beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
I didn’t mean to do it.	Na ɛnyɛ m’adwene ne sɛ mɛyɛ.
There was evil, too.	Na bɔne wɔ hɔ, nso.
Time to get this back on track.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde eyi san kɔ ne kwan so.
That is obviously a must.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛno yɛ ade a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Not as a job.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ adwuma bi.
This leads to two simple processes.	Eyi ma wɔyɛ nneɛma abien a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
His eyes turned inward.	N’ani dan kɔɔ mu.
His music career started at a very young age.	Ne nnwom adwuma no fii ase bere a na ɔyɛ abofra koraa no.
Remember what that said.	Kae nea ɛno kae no.
I do that very well.	Meyɛ saa yiye paa.
He says he is busy.	Ɔka sɛ onni adagyew.
He was obviously interested in me.	Ɛda adi sɛ na n’ani gye me ho.
But it’s weird in a good way.	Nanso ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ɔkwan pa so.
That is usually a great thing.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛno yɛ ade kɛse.
It almost never worked.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛnyɛ adwuma da.
It’s too hard for him.	Ɛyɛ den dodo ma no.
The story has continued throughout the years.	Asɛm no akɔ so wɔ mfe no nyinaa mu.
No one doubts it though.	Obiara nnye ho kyim nanso.
There were all kinds of them.	Na wɔn ahorow nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
Maybe he knew.	Ebia na onim.
Both are wonderful with children.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ nwonwa wɔ mmofra ho.
My biggest problem was the dog.	Ná me haw kɛse ne ɔkraman no.
Everybody who was everybody is there.	Obiara a na ɔyɛ obiara no wɔ hɔ.
Once again, these two situations are the same.	Saa bere yi nso, tebea abien yi yɛ ade koro.
You’re amazing.	Wo ho yɛ nwonwa.
No one else was inside.	Ná obi foforo biara nni mu.
Maybe he wasn’t there.	Ebia na onni hɔ.
It’s not the same anymore.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea na ɛte kan no bio.
This book provides information on almost everything.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ saa nhoma yi de biribiara ho nsɛm ma.
Only never quite enough.	Nkutoo na ɛdɔɔso koraa da.
You see what you want to see.	Wuhu nea wopɛ sɛ wuhu.
Neither case does.	Nsɛm abien no mu biara nyɛ saa.
He has a passion for driving fast cars.	Ɔwɔ kar a ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm a ɔbɛka ho anigye kɛse.
And we shouldn’t be doing that.	Na ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
You do everything for them.	Woyɛ biribiara ma wɔn.
I can take care of myself.	Metumi ahwɛ me ho.
He wants to do things.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nneɛma.
Not that it mattered, really.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛho hia, ampa.
I am questionable at this point.	Meyɛ obi a asɛm wɔ ho saa bere yi.
That’s what I want.	Ɛno ne nea mepɛ.
They are good people.	Wɔyɛ nnipa pa.
And you can tell me what happened.	Na wubetumi aka nea esii no akyerɛ me.
The dog looked to the side of the house.	Ɔkraman no hwɛɛ ofie no nkyɛn.
You just do your best.	Woyɛ nea wubetumi biara kɛkɛ.
Everyone looked down at him.	Obiara de ne ti too fam hwɛɛ no.
This looks awesome.	Eyi hwɛ yɛ hu.
He has a lot of books.	Ɔwɔ nhoma pii.
They tell each other.	Wɔka kyerɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
But it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛho nhia.
This is all we can do.	Eyi nkutoo ne nea yebetumi ayɛ.
What had happened had happened.	Ná nea asi no asi.
None of them knew him.	Ná wɔn mu biara nnim no.
But even so.	Nanso saa mpo no.
This is a little easier.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw kakra.
I really believe this is true.	Migye di ankasa sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
Water is essential for all forms of life.	Nsu ho hia ma nkwa ahorow nyinaa.
That’s the case here.	Saa na ɛte wɔ ha.
I don’t want this.	Mempɛ eyi.
So we do that.	Enti yɛyɛ saa.
This statement is also likely to be true.	Ɛda adi nso sɛ saa asɛm yi bɛyɛ nokware.
And he knows us.	Na onim yɛn.
I do a lot for you.	Meyɛ pii ma wo.
He had no power.	Ná onni tumi biara.
Most of the time, it’s not pretty at all.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ fɛ koraa.
Nobody wants him.	Obiara mpɛ no.
It works every time.	Ɛyɛ adwuma bere biara.
I don’t think that would make me happy anymore.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛno bɛma m’ani agye bio.
I don’t like all that stuff.	M’ani nnye saa nneɛma no nyinaa ho.
It had a head.	Ná ɛwɔ ti.
I'm sure there must be a few.	Migye di sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ kakraa bi wɔ hɔ.
Nothing is really good or really bad.	Biribiara nni hɔ a eye ankasa anaa bɔne ankasa.
I’m glad to be home.	M’ani agye sɛ mewɔ fie.
That’s not fun.	Ɛno nyɛ anigye.
We enjoyed our stay.	Yɛn ani gyee yɛn tra no ho.
But this is common.	Nanso eyi abu so.
It’s what he’s doing now.	Ɛyɛ nea ɔyɛ mprempren.
It wasn’t what was happening at the time.	Na ɛnyɛ nea na ɛrekɔ so saa bere no.
He has to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
So much had happened this past year.	Enti na nneɛma pii asi wɔ afe a etwaam yi mu.
On the other hand, this article might be really interesting.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ebia asɛm yi bɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
And the price, too.	Na ne bo nso.
For me, this is a good opportunity.	Me fam no, eyi yɛ hokwan pa.
He had done so.	Ná wayɛ saa.
Very easy to use.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma.
It would have been a problem.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ ɔhaw.
I'm just weak.	Meyɛ mmerɛw ara kwa.
He was too powerful.	Ná ɔwɔ tumi dodo.
These clothes hurt you.	Saa ntade yi yɛ wo yaw.
It’s time to do something.	Ɛyɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ biribi.
His hair was almost bald.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ne ti nhwi ayɛ mmerɛw.
He put his hand on the door.	Ɔde ne nsa too ɔpon no ano.
He had no idea this was happening.	Ná onnim sɛ eyi rekɔ so.
But it’s getting there.	Nanso ɛrekɔ hɔ.
It almost felt like home.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛte sɛ ofie.
Things are scary these days.	Nneɛma hu nnansa yi.
He’s not that strong.	Ɔnyɛ den saa.
He has no more to offer.	Onni bi a ɔde bɛma bio.
As it was the case.	Sɛnea na ɛte no.
We have	Yɛwɔ .
They are directed at people who seem to be.	Wɔde kɔ nnipa a ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ no so.
You’re suspicious of me.	W’ani gye me ho kyim.
I love this group.	M’ani gye saa kuw yi ho.
And we can.	Na yebetumi.
That would have been fun.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ anigye.
Most are unhappy.	Dodow no ara nni anigye.
For me, there was no one in that room but me.	Wɔ me fam no, na obiara nni saa dan no mu gye me nkutoo.
This point is important.	Saa asɛm yi ho hia.
You are my mother.	Wo ne me maame.
And the food got, as before.	Na aduan no nyaa, sɛnea na ɛte kan no.
This was all a temporary masterpiece.	Na eyi nyinaa yɛ bere tiaa mu ade a wɔde di dwuma yiye.
That was painful, too.	Ɛno nso yɛɛ yaw.
The best of the best.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ papa.
But that fell through.	Nanso ɛno hwee ase.
And lastly, it’s fun to use.	Na nea etwa to no, ɛyɛ anigye sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
So get yourself here immediately.	Enti fa wo ho kɔ ha ntɛm ara.
That, too, costs money.	Ɛno nso gye sika.
Not very many people that day.	Ɛnyɛ nnipa pii koraa saa da no.
The project was plagued by problems.	Ná ɔhaw ahorow ahyɛ adwuma no mu.
All materials will be provided.	Wɔde nneɛma nyinaa bɛma.
What she wanted from him and why.	Nea na ɔpɛ fi ne hɔ ne nea enti a na ɔpɛ.
Not even here.	Ɛnyɛ ha mpo.
Remove the water from it.	Yi nsu no fi mu.
I will get an error.	Me nsa bɛka mfomso bi.
They have to do it that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no saa.
None of them could.	Wɔn mu biara antumi.
Many question the wisdom of his policies.	Nnipa pii gye nyansa a ɛwɔ ne nhyehyɛe ahorow mu no ho kyim.
I thought he was this perfect guy.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔyɛ saa ɔbarima a ɔyɛ pɛ yi.
You want me to get involved in that.	Wopɛ sɛ mede me ho hyɛ saa asɛm no mu.
This reminds you of those things.	Eyi ma wokae saa nneɛma no.
I think we can show that later.	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi akyerɛ saa asɛm no akyiri yi.
What a wonderful thing.	Ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni.
For two reasons.	Nneɛma abien bi nti.
He has to drive the car.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka kar no.
The days are getting shorter.	Nna no reyɛ tiaa.
Somebody give me a hand!	Obi ma me nsa!
It was painful, but necessary.	Ná ɛyɛ yaw, nanso na ɛho hia.
Is this the one.	So eyi ne no.
I don’t know what’s behind that door.	Minnim nea ɛwɔ saa ɔpon no akyi.
That’s how it works here.	Saa na ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
It’s great, and really cheap.	Ɛyɛ kɛse, na ne bo yɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
He is doing well now.	Ɔreyɛ yiye mprempren.
I think a lot of people don’t get the book.	Misusuw sɛ nnipa pii nnya nhoma no.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
I should be happy afterwards, and I am happy and happy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani gye wɔ ɛno akyi, na m’ani gye na m’ani gye.
You do need a bit of planning though.	Wo hia nhyehyɛe kakra bi de, nanso.
But there is no one on the street.	Nanso obiara nni hɔ wɔ abɔnten so.
Relief will take a long time.	Mmoa a wɔde bɛma no begye bere tenten.
Definitely a great bottom.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔyɛ ase kɛse.
Fill in the blank.	Hyɛ baabi a ɛnyɛ hwee no ma.
Inside and out, one.	Wɔ mu ne akyi, biako.
Everyone knows you can be quick.	Obiara nim sɛ wubetumi ayɛ ntɛm.
One firm handshake, and that was it.	Nsa a wɔde bɔɔ no denneennen biako, na ɛno ne no.
You are a part of me.	Woyɛ me fã bi.
The results are already pretty impressive.	Nea afi mu aba no yɛ nwonwa yiye dedaw.
He has a job.	Ɔwɔ adwuma bi.
The setting was beautiful.	Ná tebea no yɛ fɛ yiye.
He is one of my best friends.	Ɔyɛ me nnamfo paa no mu biako.
It is an input.	Ɛyɛ nsɛm a wɔde hyɛ mu.
However, everything else does.	Nanso, biribiara a aka no yɛ saa.
But this is not true.	Nanso eyi nyɛ nokware.
I had to work at night.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma anadwo.
We can do something.	Yebetumi ayɛ biribi.
But no one came.	Nanso obiara amma.
And that’s usually our plan.	Na mpɛn pii no ɛno ne yɛn nhyehyɛe no.
I really and truly have so many pictures.	Mewɔ mfonini pii saa ankasa na ampa.
It is part of being human.	Ɛyɛ onipa a obi yɛ no fã.
I have no idea what they do.	Minni nea wɔyɛ ho adwene biara.
Otherwise, it is not.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛnte saa.
It was a good thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade pa.
The bus is packed.	Bɔs no mu ayɛ ma.
There will be ample opportunity for that.	Hokwan a ɛdɔɔso bɛba ama ɛno.
There seemed to be nothing he could do.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
But it has been great.	Nanso ayɛ kɛse.
Always expect the best.	Hwɛ nea eye sen biara kwan bere nyinaa.
But he seemed happy.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
However, it is not all.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa.
It’s like a necessary evil.	Ɛte sɛ bɔne bi a ɛho hia.
People who were working.	Nnipa a na wɔyɛ adwuma.
Do the same with the next idea.	Yɛ saa ara wɔ adwene a edi hɔ no ho.
I will tell you the truth.	Mɛka nokware akyerɛ wo.
It’s amazing what he’s doing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ nea ɔreyɛ no.
When warm, the water is less dense.	Sɛ ɛyɛ hyew a, nsu no nyɛ den pii.
So it’s going to be a really interesting thing.	Enti ɛbɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
But not the past.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea atwam no.
I have to make one for, another in this order.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biako ma, foforo wɔ nhyehyɛe yi mu.
He was a guy who really loved the game.	Na ɔyɛ ɔbarima a na n’ani gye agoru no ho ankasa.
That’s quite awesome, really.	Ɛno yɛ hu koraa, ampa.
This is why most people turn to books.	Eyi nti na nnipa dodow no ara dan kɔ nhoma so no.
He gave me the money.	Ɔde sika no maa me.
The problem is, someone did.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ, obi yɛɛ saa.
Not too long.	Ɛnyɛ tenten dodo.
None of them seem to work for me.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔn mu biara nyɛ adwuma mma me.
It’s not the point.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm no.
I still have a lot to say.	Meda so ara wɔ nsɛm pii a mɛka.
But you’re not really here.	Nanso wo nni ha ankasa.
Someone has to say something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi ka biribi.
Very easy to use.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
I could not believe the new results.	Ná mintumi nnye nea afi mu aba foforo no nni.
That sounds fantastic.	Ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
The time is now.	Bere no ne mprempren.
No child placement.	Abofra biara nni hɔ a wɔde besi hɔ.
For the rest of our lives.	Yɛn nkwa nna nyinaa.
Maybe they do.	Ebia wɔyɛ saa.
His children did the same.	Ne mma nso yɛɛ saa.
He has a good reputation in the city.	Ɔwɔ din pa wɔ kurow no mu.
This will lengthen your legs.	Eyi bɛma wo nan ayɛ tenten.
I worked through it.	Meyɛɛ adwuma faa mu.
I have a few.	Mewɔ kakraa bi.
He's just adjusting to his new situation.	Ɔreyɛ ne tebea foforo no ara kwa.
Give, and it will be given to you.	Momma, na wɔde bɛma mo.
This, to me, is an absolutely fantastic dish.	Eyi, wɔ me fam no, yɛ aduan a ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
It’s that simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
I know this is true.	Minim sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
You can go on, if you like.	Wubetumi akɔ so, sɛ wopɛ a.
The city is prosperous today.	Kurow no di yiye nnɛ.
He had nothing to take home.	Ná onni biribiara a ɔde bɛkɔ fie.
But every time it’s the same thing, it’s not.	Nanso bere biara a ɛyɛ ade koro no ara, ɛnte saa.
But everything is there.	Nanso biribiara wɔ hɔ.
However, there are two exceptions.	Nanso, nneɛma abien na ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛnyɛ saa.
At the end of the day.	Wɔ da no awiei.
I really like that.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho ampa.
We can go for it.	Yebetumi akɔ.
I want him to enjoy the moment.	Mepɛ sɛ n’ani gye bere no ho.
Where does that money come from?.	Ɛhe na saa sika no fi?.
Probably not for another year or so.	Ebia ɛnyɛ afe foforo anaa nea ɛte saa.
Don’t you like them?	So w’ani nnye wɔn ho?
I have to go now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ mprempren.
He didn’t have to pretend.	Na enhia sɛ ɔyɛ ne ho sɛ ɔyɛ.
It’s my name.	Ɛyɛ me din.
In terms of the support.	Wɔ mmoa a wɔde ma no ho.
It will be new used.	Ɛbɛyɛ foforo a wɔde adi dwuma.
I just paint a lot.	Meyɛ mfonini pii kɛkɛ.
The whole day was going to be spectacular.	Ná da mũ no nyinaa bɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
But you don’t just talk about sex.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nna ho asɛm na woka ho asɛm kɛkɛ.
This is what is most important to us.	Eyi ne nea ɛho hia yɛn paa.
It’s a necessary thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛho hia.
No one had more privilege at that point than he did.	Obiara nni hɔ a na ɔwɔ hokwan kɛse wɔ saa bere no mu sen ɔno.
However, there have been some interesting results in this regard.	Nanso, nneɛma bi a ɛyɛ anigye afi mu aba wɔ eyi mu.
She is a very nice person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
She wanted a man, not a boy.	Ná ɔpɛ ɔbarima, na ɛnyɛ abarimaa.
He knew not to worry.	Ná onim sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔhaw ne ho.
To dinner maybe.	To anwummere aduan ebia.
No one said much.	Obiara anka pii.
He didn't need to say anything else.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔka biribi foforo biara.
Not the first time its happened.	Ɛnyɛ bere a edi kan a ne sii.
And in my opinion, this is not the thing.	Na wɔ m’adwene mu no, ɛnyɛ eyi ne ade no.
But there is something to be done.	Nanso biribi wɔ baabi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
The matter is still in the planning stage.	Asɛm no da so ara wɔ nhyehyɛe no fã no mu.
The kids are in school, you know.	Mmofra no wɔ sukuu mu, wunim.
According to the system.	Sɛnea nhyehyɛe no yɛ no.
It was a great time.	Na ɛyɛ bere kɛse.
A few times a day.	Mpɛn kakraa bi da biara.
It’s not helpful.	Ɛnyɛ mmoa.
I know him better than anyone.	Minim no yiye sen obiara.
If you want something new and fresh.	Sɛ wopɛ biribi foforo a ɛyɛ foforo.
Below is the monthly mood chart.	Wɔ ase hɔ no, ɔsram biara adwene ho nhyehyɛe no wɔ hɔ.
He’s working on it.	Ɔreyɛ ho adwuma.
I knew how to do that.	Ná minim sɛnea mɛyɛ saa.
Or just the movie.	Anaasɛ sini no ara kwa.
If one can do this.	Sɛ obi betumi ayɛ eyi a.
This is their game.	Eyi ne wɔn agoru.
He told me that money had nothing to do with it.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ sika nni hwee yɛ.
However, this situation is not the one before us.	Nanso, tebea yi nte saa a ɛwɔ yɛn anim no.
Fill it completely.	Hyɛ no ma koraa.
But it seems likely.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
What seems to be the problem?	Ɛte sɛ nea dɛn ne ɔhaw no?
He seemed to want nothing from her.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔmpɛ biribiara mfi ne hɔ.
Bad, bad mistake.	Mfomso bɔne, bɔne bɔne.
He had an uncanny ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood.	Ná ɔwɔ tumi a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɔde hu nokware ne atoro.
Tonight there is no danger.	Anadwo yi asiane biara nni hɔ.
I love it, to be honest.	M’ani gye ho, sɛ mɛka nokware a.
These programs exist and exist.	Saa nhyehyɛe ahorow yi wɔ hɔ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
He knows a lot of things.	Onim nneɛma pii.
That is not always the case.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛte saa.
I have an idea.	Mewɔ adwene bi.
He has a wonderful reputation.	Ɔwɔ din a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Maybe he can even win.	Ebia obetumi adi nkonim mpo.
During the year.	Wɔ afe no mu.
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There was a reason why he shouldn't touch her.	Ná biribi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka no.
This man was everything to me.	Ná saa ɔbarima yi yɛ me biribiara.
I went there but not often.	Ná mekɔ hɔ nanso na ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii.
Each of them can be quite temporary.	Wɔn mu biara betumi ayɛ bere tiaa mu de koraa.
I believe in him.	Migye no di.
My mom asked me why too.	Me maame bisaa me nso nea enti a ɛte saa.
That really touched me.	Ɛno kaa me paa.
But it does exist.	Nanso ɛwɔ hɔ.
There is no sense in it.	Adwene biara nni mu.
He was interested in the story.	N’ani gyee asɛm no ho.
And you weren’t there.	Na wo nni hɔ.
Everything seemed to be working.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara reyɛ adwuma.
He looked terrible.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ hu.
I can’t do it alone.	Me nkutoo ntumi nyɛ.
That’s very hard to do.	Ɛno yɛ den yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ.
Not everyone would be.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
However, something was wrong.	Nanso, na biribi anyɛ yiye.
It was a hot day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ hyew.
There are only three things that are therefore like that on a person.	Nneɛma abiɛsa pɛ na enti ɛte saa wɔ obi so.
He didn’t like her either.	Ná n’ani nnye ne ho nso.
It was him.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔno.
It was a relatively safe time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a asiane nnim koraa.
And he was thrilled.	Na n’ani gyee ho.
Party time!	Apontow bere!
It was difficult but necessary.	Ná ɛyɛ den nanso na ɛho hia.
It is something we do or do.	Ɛyɛ biribi a yɛyɛ anaa yɛyɛ.
The day was hot.	Ná da no mu ayɛ hyew.
I am used to talking about these things.	Ɛyɛ me su sɛ mɛka saa nneɛma yi ho asɛm.
He looked weak but he wasn't.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ mmerɛw nanso na ɔnyɛ saa.
I'm with my mother.	Me ne me maame.
But that is not the case in this case.	Nanso ɛnte saa wɔ asɛm yi mu.
Say something about it.	Ka asɛm bi.
It’s nothing else.	Ɛnyɛ biribi foforo biara.
I'm sure you know what that is.	Migye di sɛ wunim nea ɛno yɛ.
So, we had to do something about it.	Enti, na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi.
Get off me!	Fi me so!
He had many trials.	Na ɔwɔ sɔhwɛ ahorow pii.
It’s cold and crunchy, but it’s not all bad.	Ɛyɛ awɔw na ɛyɛ mmerɛw, nanso ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa bɔne.
On the phone.	Wɔ telefon so.
Watch your speech!	Hwɛ wo kasa!
You are doing an important job.	Woreyɛ adwuma a ɛho hia.
Our study is interesting.	Yɛn adesua no yɛ anigye.
He's doing well.	Ɔreyɛ yiye.
This transfer of control over the issue is critical.	Saa tumi a wɔde bɛma wɔ asɛm no so yi ho hia yiye.
He’s got his hands full.	Ɔde ne nsa ayɛ ma.
So much money moves every day.	Enti sika pii tu kɔ da biara da.
All these things.	Saa nneɛma yi nyinaa.
It’s a very interesting concept.	Ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
And it was that.	Na ɛyɛ sɛ.
There were no words.	Ná nsɛm biara nni hɔ.
His only two.	Ne baanu koro pɛ.
It’s the only right way.	Ɛyɛ ɔkwan pa nkutoo.
Don’t assume this helps.	Mfa no sɛ eyi mmoa.
But this does not solve the problem.	Nanso eyi ntumi nni ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
They are powerful things.	Wɔyɛ nneɛma a tumi wom.
But it certainly must be something interesting.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ anigye.
You seem to be a competent person.	Ɛte sɛ nea woyɛ obi a wo ho akokwaw.
He was a gun.	Ná ɔyɛ tuo.
Which was little more than nothing.	Nea na ɛyɛ kakraa bi sen hwee.
I saw it for him.	Mihuu no maa no.
No one else did much to help.	Obi foforo biara anyɛ pii de aboa.
Very strong hands.	Nsa a ɛyɛ den yiye.
You just get used to it.	Wo ho yɛ wo su ara kwa.
But it was difficult.	Nanso na ɛyɛ den.
It’s too bad for them.	Ɛyɛ bɔne dodo ma wɔn.
We have a lot of work to do there as well.	Yɛwɔ adwuma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ wɔ hɔ nso.
I have a weird problem.	Mewɔ ɔhaw bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I just gave him the information.	Mede nsɛm no maa no ara kwa.
That’s too easy.	Ɛno yɛ mmerɛw dodo.
His father says he has too many ideas.	Ne papa ka sɛ ɔwɔ adwene pii dodo.
And for the most part, it is.	Na fã kɛse no ara no, ɛte saa.
I forget this.	Me werɛ fi eyi.
Take your time and think about it.	Gye wo bere na susuw ho.
But that wasn’t an issue.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ asɛm.
I couldn’t feel anything.	Ná mintumi nte biribiara nka.
I hope that’s not you.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ wo na ɛte saa.
It’s been done.	Ayɛ yiye.
However, it is not so easy.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
He intends to do so every day.	Ɔyɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa da biara da.
It was really there.	Ná ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
But it’s the other way around.	Nanso ɛyɛ ɔkwan foforo so.
That’s the only thing you can control.	Ɛno nkutoo ne ade a wubetumi adi so.
I think he can do it.	Misusuw sɛ obetumi ayɛ.
Keep working as long as you can.	Kɔ so yɛ adwuma bere tenten biara a wubetumi.
These shoes are the best.	Saa mpaboa yi na eye sen biara.
I have been busy.	Mayɛ obi a onni adagyew.
I know his names.	Minim ne din ahorow.
Mornings can’t get any further.	Anɔpa ntumi nkɔ akyiri.
Everything good takes time.	Biribiara pa gye bere.
I can relate to that.	Metumi de saa asɛm no abɔ mu.
Maybe now is the time.	Ebia mprempren ne bere no.
He’s a great guy.	Ɔyɛ kɛse.
Play three games.	Di agoru abiɛsa.
The song was a huge hit.	Dwom no maa nkurɔfo ho dwiriw wɔn kɛse.
Again the whole exterior is very smooth.	Bio nso akyi no nyinaa yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
However, there was work.	Nanso, na adwuma wɔ hɔ.
He was gone for just a moment.	Ná onni hɔ bio bere tiaa bi pɛ.
This is still very simple actually.	Eyi da so ara yɛ mmerɛw yiye ankasa.
We will do this next week.	Yɛbɛyɛ eyi dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
He can do it with people, too.	Obetumi ne nnipa ayɛ, nso.
I got my sleep this morning.	Me nyaa me nna anɔpa yi.
It doesn’t seem to be.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnte saa.
All but three of them.	Ne nyinaa gye abiɛsa.
After that, they drove for days.	Ɛno akyi no, wɔde nna pii kaa kar.
That’s a busy weekend.	Ɛno yɛ dapɛn awiei a adagyew nnim.
It was in a school.	Ná ɛwɔ sukuu bi mu.
Over the years.	Wɔ mfe no mu.
This is not a performance.	Eyi nyɛ agoru a wɔyɛ.
This is incredibly beautiful.	Eyi yɛ fɛ ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
What a mistake this is.	Mfomso bɛn ara ni.
I really didn’t like it that much.	Ankasa na m’ani nnye ho saa.
They were concerned about work.	Na adwuma ho asɛm hia wɔn.
Like the.	Te sɛ nea.
On hand here.	Wɔ nsa so wɔ ha.
You do whatever it takes.	Woyɛ nea ɛho hia biara.
Don't tell me those things.	Nka saa nsɛm no nkyerɛ me.
Put it back on.	Fa to hɔ bio.
He was focused on one thing.	Ná ɔde n’adwene asi ade biako pɛ so.
I'm supposed to tell you this from your mother.	Me na ɛsɛ sɛ meka eyi kyerɛ wo fi wo maame hɔ.
Thank you very much.	Meda mo ase pii.
Fear of the night.	Anadwo ho suro.
These details are not important.	Saa nsɛm yi nyɛ nea ɛho hia.
But he was full enough.	Nanso na wayɛ ma sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Stories reveal something that already exists.	Asɛm ahorow da biribi a ɛwɔ hɔ dedaw adi kyerɛ yɛn.
It’s a lot of fun.	Ɛyɛ anigye pii.
The plan was put on hold.	Wɔde nhyehyɛe no too nkyɛn.
No shoes, no clothes.	Mpaboa biara nni hɔ, atade biara nni hɔ.
This is certainly true.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
He told her that it was going well.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛrekɔ so yiye.
I don't need it.	Me ho nhia me.
In our opinion it was in order.	Wɔ yɛn adwene mu no na ɛwɔ nhyehyɛe mu.
We can use someone who has his power.	Yebetumi de obi a ɔwɔ ne tumi adi dwuma.
A person who works with his hands.	Obi a ɔde ne nsa yɛ adwuma.
She had difficulty concentrating.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma no sɛ ɔde n’adwene besi biribi so.
It was inside.	Ná ɛwɔ mu.
Partly because he was.	Ne fã bi ne sɛ na ɔte saa.
He had high hopes it was an accident.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso kɛse sɛ ɛyɛ akwanhyia bi.
No one can take away their trust in him.	Obiara ntumi nnye wɔn ho a wɔde to no so no.
I just can’t seem to get that.	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nnya saa ara kɛkɛ.
My thoughts are with you.	M’adwene wɔ mo nkyɛn.
The last few years have been a little rough.	Mfe kakraa a atwam no ayɛ nea ɛyɛ den kakra.
Therefore, the group may be artificial.	Enti, ebia kuw no bɛyɛ nea wɔde nsa ayɛ.
His speech seemed to go down pretty well.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne kasa no kɔɔ fam yiye.
But the whole story fails to do so.	Nanso asɛm no nyinaa ntumi nyɛ saa.
He had really enjoyed his walk.	Ná n’ani agye ne nantew no ho ankasa.
A lot of what’s going on.	Nea ɛrekɔ so pii.
I used my head.	Mede me ti dii dwuma.
Most of the people were shocked.	Nnipa no mu dodow no ara ho dwiriw wɔn.
Water is essential for life.	Nsu ho hia ma nkwa.
Most are self-indulgent.	Dodow no ara yɛ wɔn ho a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu.
It is unclear why it is so appealing to him.	Ɛnyɛ nea enti a ɛyɛ nea n’ani gye ho saa no mu nna hɔ.
But it was still too hard.	Nanso na ɛda so ara yɛ den dodo.
And it was the man.	Na ɛyɛ ɔbarima no.
You got a headache.	Wo nyaa ti a ɛyɛ den.
I want to thank all of you here tonight	Mepɛ sɛ meda mo nyinaa ase wɔ ha anadwo yi
I don’t need to know anything else.	Ɛho nhia sɛ mihu biribi foforo biara.
I'm still not sure why.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa no yiye de besi nnɛ.
I believe we have the resources to do the job.	Migye di sɛ yɛwɔ nneɛma a yɛde bɛyɛ adwuma no.
They do it in my name.	Wɔyɛ no me din mu.
He quickly closed the door.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm too ɔpon no mu.
They are extremely rare.	Wɔn ho yɛ na koraa.
Which might be the idea.	Nea ebia ɛbɛyɛ adwene no.
It’s at the other end of everything.	Ɛwɔ biribiara awiei foforo.
The moment of truth.	Nokware bere no.
How long ago it seemed.	Bere tenten bɛn na na ɛte sɛ nea atwam.
Maybe there is just no hope for him.	Ebia anidaso biara nni ne ho ara kwa.
This feels amazing.	Eyi te nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It does seem a bit strange.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra ampa.
But this is not the case.	Nanso eyi nte saa.
I liked those things.	M’ani gyee saa nneɛma no ho.
I am here to bring our program to a close.	Mewɔ ha sɛ mede yɛn nhyehyɛe no bɛba awiei.
Maybe that should all happen.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno nyinaa ba.
He could let himself do this.	Ná obetumi ama ne ho ayɛ eyi.
Take care of yourself.	Hwɛ wo ho yiye.
However, it is not true.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nokware.
He had a great game though.	Na ɔwɔ agoru kɛse bi de, nanso.
Either way, someone will join you this afternoon.	Ɔkwan biara so no, obi bɛka wo ho awia yi.
It was absolutely terrifying.	Ná ɛyɛ hu koraa.
You’re in here.	Wowɔ ha mu.
No one ever really does.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ saa ankasa da.
He had a point.	Na ɔwɔ asɛm bi.
What would you do?	Sɛ wobɛyɛ dɛn?
It was a good plan.	Ná ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe pa.
He was no longer human.	Ná ɔnyɛ onipa bio.
Many people walked to work that year.	Nnipa pii nantew kɔɔ adwuma saa afe no.
This week means so much more.	Dapɛn yi kyerɛ pii sen saa.
I saw this.	Mihuu eyi.
That had to mean something.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno kyerɛ biribi.
The first is the age of most children.	Nea edi kan ne mfe a mmofra dodow no ara adi.
That is a real problem.	Ɛno yɛ ɔhaw ankasa.
There is still work to be done.	Adwuma da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Books were very scarce at the time.	Ná nhoma ho yɛ na koraa saa bere no.
A positive statement.	Asɛm a ɛyɛ papa.
Don’t let the bad guys have it.	Mma nnipa bɔne no nnya bi.
No one has done that.	Obiara nyɛɛ saa.
It was early still there.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛm da so ara wɔ hɔ.
He was so nice about it.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye wɔ ho.
I was once that boy.	Bere bi na meyɛ saa abarimaa no.
And you can get one.	Na wubetumi anya bi.
And it was really exciting.	Na na ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
He felt better.	Ne ho tɔɔ no.
Sex is essential to survival.	Nna ho hia na ama obi anya nkwa.
It’s like you were somewhere else.	Ɛte sɛ nea na wowɔ baabi foforo.
He has a huge pile of books in his bedroom.	Ɔwɔ nhoma pii kɛse wɔ ne mpa mu.
And you will do more.	Na wo nso wobɛyɛ pii.
Such is our present situation.	Saa na yɛn mprempren tebea no te.
This was not easy.	Ná eyi nyɛ mmerɛw.
If you want to know.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ wuhu a.
This is just the first day.	Eyi yɛ da a edi kan ara kwa.
It wasn’t hard enough.	Na ɛnyɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He has a good job.	Ɔwɔ adwuma pa.
I know all about your few days.	Minim wo nna kakraa bi no ho nsɛm nyinaa.
Not in any way, or shape.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan biara so, anaa ɔkwan biara so.
There was plenty of room yet.	Ná baabi a ɛdɔɔso wɔ hɔ de besi nnɛ.
It was the last of its kind.	Ná ɛyɛ nea etwa to wɔ ne su mu.
Look, look, and look.	Hwɛ, hwɛ, na hwɛ.
It wasn’t anything like that.	Ná ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
Surprisingly, this is not always the case.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa no, ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛte saa.
He never wants that.	Ɔmpɛ saa da.
Something was going down below.	Ná biribi rekɔ fam wɔ ase hɔ.
Why does he always blush when he says that?	Dɛn nti na sɛ ɔka saa a, ne ho yɛ no hyew bere nyinaa?
I immersed myself in that moment.	Mede me ho hyɛɛ saa bere no mu.
It will always be that way.	Ɛbɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
I think that includes us.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ka yɛn ho.
It is my life force.	Ɛyɛ me nkwa tumi.
I couldn’t forget him.	Ná me werɛ ntumi mfi no.
No one could do anything.	Obiara antumi anyɛ hwee.
It was a terrible movie.	Ná ɛyɛ sini a ɛyɛ hu.
My head, my feet, one hand.	Me ti, me nan, nsa biako.
He loved people.	Ná ɔpɛ nnipa.
Just take what you can.	Fa nea wubetumi ayɛ ara kwa.
He already knows that.	Onim saa dedaw.
That’s the thing.	Ɛno ne ade no.
He knew that he usually didn't have to try very hard.	Ná onim sɛ mpɛn pii no, ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden kɛse.
It’s not about human rights.	Ɛnyɛ nnipa hokwan ahorow ho asɛm.
I played with them for hours.	Mede nnɔnhwerew pii ne wɔn dii agoru.
But my father had no interest in us.	Nanso na me papa nni yɛn ho anigye biara.
Did you enjoy the food?	So w’ani gyee aduan no ho?
That’s it in the end though.	Ɛno na ɛwɔ awiei no de, nanso.
Sounds like a good, really good person.	Ɛte sɛ nea obi pa, ɔyɛ papa ankasa.
However, his feelings for his mother are not sexual.	Nanso, sɛnea ɔte nka wɔ ne maame ho no nyɛ nna.
It just felt so hard.	Ná ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ den ara kwa.
Nor did he want to do that.	Saa ara nso na na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I could let myself into it.	Ná metumi ama me ho akɔ mu.
You are not doing it for me.	Ɛnyɛ wo na woreyɛ ama me.
It looks great underwater.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye wɔ nsu no ase.
How will he recover from this?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na ne ho bɛtɔ no afi eyi mu?
This was for a number of reasons.	Ná nneɛma ahorow bi nti na ɛte saa.
In here, nothing can touch me.	Wɔ ha mu no, biribiara ntumi nka me.
This apartment is currently occupied by a tenant.	Mprempren obi a ɔte dan yi mu na ɔte mu.
I actually did that.	Meyɛɛ saa ankasa.
Do it for a day.	Yɛ no da koro.
That is a huge problem.	Ɛno yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
He was there that day.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ saa da no.
It didn’t hurt me.	Ná ɛnyɛ me yaw.
Maybe it was half true.	Ebia na ɛyɛ nokware fã.
However, there was one thing that still surprised me.	Nanso, na ade biako wɔ hɔ a ɛda so ara yɛ me nwonwa.
We have a long drive ahead in the cold.	Yɛwɔ kar tenten bi wɔ yɛn anim wɔ awɔw mu.
You have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I know what he wants.	Minim nea ɔpɛ.
Put everything down.	Fa biribiara too hɔ.
And there aren’t that many of us.	Na yɛn mu pii nni hɔ saa.
Don’t argue with me!	Mma wo ne me nnye akyinnye!
Tell me the honest truth.	Ka nokware a ɛyɛ nokware kyerɛ me.
Everyone got the details right.	Obiara nyaa nsɛm no mu nsɛm no yiye.
However, I doubt it.	Nanso, migye ho kyim.
He nodded sharply.	Ɔde ne ti too fam denneennen.
Therefore	Enti
Without him, it would be completely empty.	Sɛ ɔno nni hɔ a, anka ɛbɛyɛ nea hwee nni mu koraa.
A simple statement.	Asɛm bi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Each month, the number increased.	Ɔsram biara no, dodow no kɔɔ anim.
I think they will enjoy it.	Misusuw sɛ wɔn ani begye ho.
Once again, less is more.	Saa bere yi nso, kakraa bi na ɛdɔɔso.
Don’t share the movie with anyone.	Mma sini no mu nsɛm nkyerɛ obiara.
She had been hard on him, and he didn't know why.	Ná wayɛ den ama no, na na onnim nea enti a ɛte saa.

These things are not automatic.	Saa nneɛma yi nyɛ nea wɔyɛ ara kwa.
And you already have it.	Na wowɔ bi dedaw.
I don't have time to do this right now.	Minni bere a mede bɛyɛ eyi mprempren.
It seems to be a mistake.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mfomso.
You are better than me.	Woyɛ papa sen me.
I looked at him with interest.	Mede anigye hwɛɛ no ​​denneennen.
And it was him.	Na ɛyɛ ɔno.
Go to my window and give me a drink.	Kɔ me mfɛnsere mu na ma me nsa.
We can have that again.	Yebetumi anya saa bio.
However, this does not occur much in his books.	Nanso, eyi mma pii wɔ ne nhoma ahorow mu.
Maybe even his father.	Ebia ne papa mpo.
That doesn’t matter.	Ɛno nyɛ hwee.
It just seemed faster to get there.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ntɛm sɛ mɛkɔ hɔ ara kwa.
I am a busy person.	Meyɛ obi a mewɔ adagyew.
It’s hard to tell.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka.
After that, things get more complicated.	Ɛno akyi no, nneɛma mu yɛ den kɛse.
Work has been going on for a long time.	Adwuma akɔ so bere tenten ni.
The house is in perfect condition.	Ofie no wɔ tebea a edi mũ mu.
I knew exactly what he had done.	Ná minim nea wayɛ no yiye.
After only a short time	Bere tiaa bi pɛ akyi
Not the old, not the new.	Ɛnyɛ dedaw no, ɛnyɛ foforo no.
He’s good, but not this good.	Ɔyɛ papa, nanso ɛnyɛ papa yi.
But here there was no option.	Nanso ha no, na ɔkwan biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛma.
However, this is part of the plan.	Nanso, eyi yɛ nhyehyɛe no fã.
Can anyone help please?.	Obi betumi aboa mesrɛ wo?.
He glanced at the paper.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ krataa no so.
However, I feel it is wrong in a way.	Nanso, mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
He is the one who is there.	Ɔno ne obi a ɔwɔ hɔ.
I’m the most excited about it.	M’ani gyee ho sen biara.
It’s been cold today, hasn’t it?	Awɔw ayɛ hɔ nnɛ, ɛnte saa?
Everyone looked the other way.	Obiara hwɛɛ ɔkwan foforo so.
Not in an obvious way.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan a ɛda adi so.
They were good kids.	Ná wɔyɛ mmofra pa.
But even a child can think.	Nanso abofra mpo tumi susuw nneɛma ho.
Great opportunity for first time investor.	Hokwan kɛse ma nea edi kan a ɔde ne sika hyɛ mu.
It is better to use a bus than a car.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wode bɔs bedi dwuma sen sɛ wode kar bedi dwuma.
I don’t know, it’s not really true.	Minnim, ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa.
Water acts as a solvent.	Nsu yɛ adwuma sɛ ade a wɔde hyɛ mu.
I am very bad right now.	Meyɛ bɔne paa mprempren.
The not-so-great thing.	Nea ɛnyɛ kɛse ho asɛm no.
Look at this picture.	Hwɛ mfonini yi.
I can actually be myself now.	Metumi ayɛ me ho ankasa mprempren.
At night, someone came to the house.	Anadwo no, obi baa fie hɔ.
It looks like it’s going to be a popular, expensive thing.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ ade a agye din, ne bo yɛ den.
But it was better than that.	Nanso na eye sen saa.
Assume the latter.	Fa no sɛ nea etwa to no.
However, it is not the only one.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo.
We cannot come this way .	Yɛrentumi mma saa kwan yi so .
Power for many days.	Tumi nna pii.
I got too nervous last week.	Me ho yɛɛ me den dodo dapɛn a etwaam no.
There was nothing to do.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Or at least where it was in my day.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, baabi a na ɛwɔ wɔ me bere so no.
Still, "it's a pretty good thing," he says.	Nanso, "ɛyɛ ade a eye yiye," ɔka.
I am entitled to my opinion.	Mewɔ hokwan sɛ mewɔ m’adwene.
That’s why it’s so popular.	Ɛno nti na agye din no.
Humanitarian aid is critical here.	Mmoa a wɔde ma nnipa ho hia kɛse wɔ ha.
I just kind of thing.	Me ade a ɛte saa ara kɛkɛ.
Keep your hands busy.	Ma wo nsa nkɔ so nyɛ adwuma.
Or, it should be.	Anaasɛ, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
Nothing else matters to him.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛho hia no.
So get rid of it.	Enti yi fi hɔ.
I just want to thank you.	Mepɛ sɛ meda wo ase kɛkɛ.
I'm glad you're here today.	M'ani agye sɛ wowɔ ha nnɛ.
Just not immediately.	Ɛnyɛ ntɛm ara kɛkɛ.
This name alone speaks volumes.	Saa din yi nkutoo ka nsɛm pii.
Keep an eye out for the dog.	Ma w’ani nna hɔ wɔ ɔkraman no ho.
For most of my friends, it was easy.	Wɔ me nnamfo dodow no ara fam no, na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
She was beautiful, no doubt about that.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ, na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno ho asɛm.
And music can take a simple movie a step further.	Na nnwom betumi de sini a ɛyɛ mmerɛw akɔ akyiri.
Do not remove any water.	Mfa nsu biara mfi mu.
We would do anything for each other.	Anka yɛbɛyɛ biribiara ama yɛn ho yɛn ho.
However, that is not the reason.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno nti na ɛte saa.
But you already know that.	Nanso wunim saa dedaw.
All the accusations against him could be true.	Nsɛm a wɔka tiaa no no nyinaa betumi ayɛ nokware.
That ’s not true.	Ɛno ’nyɛ nokware.
Don’t say you don’t.	Nka sɛ wonyɛ saa.
He did it for me.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​maa me.
First, it works well.	Nea edi kan no, ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
And it wasn’t a terrible idea.	Na na ɛnyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ hu.
Probably not a good idea.	Ebia ɛnyɛ adwene pa.
Last year it didn’t matter.	Afe a etwaam no na ɛnyɛ hwee.
And that would be him.	Na ɛno bɛyɛ ɔno.
You forgot your picture.	Wo werɛ afi wo mfonini no.
We have good jobs.	Yɛwɔ nnwuma pa.
But it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛnyɛ hwee.
There was nothing else he could do.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
More details will be coming soon.	Nsɛm pii bɛba nnansa yi ara.
This investment has been very successful.	Saa sika a wɔde ahyɛ mu yi ayɛ yiye kɛse.
Make it bigger again.	Ma ɛnyɛ kɛse bio.
Or so it seemed.	Anaasɛ saa na na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte.
And you are very good.	Na woyɛ papa paa.
But it’s a mistake.	Nanso ɛyɛ mfomso.
I can’t go on like that.	Mintumi nkɔ so saa.
She is not a girl.	Ɛnyɛ abeawa bi ne no.
People want to be like me.	Nkurɔfo pɛ sɛ wɔyɛ te sɛ me.
It may be accelerating this year.	Ebia ɛrekɔ so ntɛmntɛm afe yi.
It’s his character.	Ɛyɛ ne su.
I talk to my wife that way too.	Me ne me yere nso kasa saa kwan no so.
I think the school understood.	Misusuw sɛ sukuu no tee ase.
Sign up for the course.	Fa wo din hyɛ adesua no mu.
He had to deliver, somehow.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ma, ɔkwan bi so.
I made the mistake, but it’s in the past.	Meyɛɛ mfomso no, nanso ɛyɛ bere a atwam no.
Either way, if anyone knew, it would be a problem.	Ɔkwan biara so no, sɛ obi nim a, ɛbɛyɛ ɔhaw.
Anything will do to begin with.	Biribiara bɛyɛ de afi ase.
It was hard, so hard.	Ná ɛyɛ den, na ɛyɛ den saa.
I have one of them.	Mewɔ wɔn mu biako.
Consumption is food consumption.	Nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma no yɛ aduan a wɔde di dwuma.
They are the same person.	Wɔyɛ onipa koro no ara.
One just has to know how to do it right.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi hu sɛnea ɔbɛyɛ no yiye ara kwa.
It was just my name and nothing next to it.	Ná me din nkutoo na na biribiara nni ne nkyɛn.
He was imprisoned.	Wɔde no too afiase.
He was with us, but just barely.	Ná ɔne yɛn wɔ hɔ, nanso na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔnyɛ saa ara.
Spend some time at your desk.	Fa bere kakra tra wo pon so.
The man has a car.	Ɔbarima no wɔ kar.
The product was expensive.	Ná ade no bo yɛ den.
I forget mine too.	Me nso me werɛ fi me de no.
It was too good to be true.	Ná eye dodo sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nokware.
But this issue doesn’t matter.	Nanso asɛm yi mfa ho.
But in real terms, nothing could be further from the truth.	Nanso wɔ nsɛm ankasa mu no, biribiara ntumi nkɔ akyiri sen nokware no.
The same is true.	Saa ara nso na.
But it seems bigger and more complex.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ kɛse na ɛyɛ den kɛse.
Maybe this is what you want.	Ebia eyi ne nea wopɛ.
No one knew much about it.	Ná obiara nnim ho nsɛm pii.
I've done that.	Mayɛ saa.
You knew me.	Ná wunim me.
Thank you for that.	Meda wo ase wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Like it was just another game.	Te sɛ nea na ɛyɛ agoru foforo ara kwa.
He thinks about many things.	Osusuw nneɛma pii ho.
You don’t have to be pretty, here.	Ɛho nhia sɛ woyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ, ha.
Let you have to do it.	Ma ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
This is very important.	Eyi ho hia paa.
There was a lot of old money here.	Ná sika dedaw pii wɔ ha.
No one seemed to care much.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obiara mfa ne ho kɛse.
Most of me aren’t even with me now.	Me mu dodow no ara nka me ho mpo mprempren.
That would be great.	Ɛno bɛyɛ kɛse.
He must be here somewhere.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔwɔ ha wɔ baabi.
But people speak a different language among themselves.	Nanso nkurɔfo ka kasa foforo wɔ wɔn mu.
So obviously it will work.	Enti ɛda adi sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
At least for the night.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, anadwo no.
It’s not something we do to fill time.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a yɛyɛ de hyɛ bere mu ma.
We could watch it for hours.	Ná yebetumi ahwɛ no nnɔnhwerew pii.
But for me, it’s also an interesting story.	Nanso me fam no, ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye nso.
I’m interested in this.	M’ani gye eyi ho.
Our days begin at night.	Yɛn nna fi ase anadwo.
The man seemed familiar.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔbarima no nim no yiye.
I never knew anyone by that name.	Minnim obiara a ɔde saa din no da.
I saw it just now.	Mihuu no mprempren ara.
It’s a wonderful night either way.	Ɛyɛ anadwo a ɛyɛ nwonwa ɔkwan biara so.
Heat some water.	Fa nsu bi yɛ hyew.
Be careful what you wish for, they say.	Wɔka sɛ, hwɛ yiye wɔ nea wopɛ ho.
There is only one thing we need to do.	Ade biako pɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
Their panic grew day by day.	Wɔn adwene a ɛyɛ hu no yɛɛ kɛse da biara da.
It’s what the police are supposed to do.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ polisifo yɛ.
He is so wonderful.	Ɔyɛ nwonwa yiye.
But for some reason this method doesn’t work.	Nanso biribi nti saa kwan yi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
He knows me too well.	Onim me yiye dodo.
Where were we when.	Ɛhe na na yɛwɔ bere a.
After all, it wasn’t that long ago.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na ɛnyɛ bere tenten saa.
I want to go for a walk.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ nantew.
No more big windows.	Mfɛnsere kɛse biara nni hɔ bio.
There is no one at the door.	Obiara nni ɔpon no ano.
That’s just the way it is.	Ɛno ara ne saa.
Go and go for a walk.	Kɔ na kɔ nantew.
The truth begins to grow.	Nokware no fi ase yɛ kɛse.
The thought left him.	Adwene no fii ne so.
I was a little stiff.	Ná meyɛ den kakra.
I guess that’s all for now.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno nyinaa yɛ mprempren de.
The kids are excited!	Mmofra no ani agye!
Let me do that.	Ma menyɛ saa.
Now all is well.	Mprempren ne nyinaa ayɛ yiye.
This is not likely.	Eyi nyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
There is nothing else in it.	Biribi foforo biara nni mu.
Not me and up on it, that's really it.	Ɛnyɛ me ne so wɔ so, ɛno ankasa.
It was lowered on the floor.	Wɔde sii fam wɔ fam.
I seemed happy after all.	Ɛte sɛ nea na anigye wɔ me ho wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
We couldn’t have said it better ourselves.	Anka yɛn ankasa ntumi nka no yiye.
But stay tonight.	Nanso tra hɔ anadwo yi.
That sounds pretty amazing to me.	Ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye ma me.
The two cars nearly collided.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ kar abien no bɔɔ mu.
Nothing went wrong.	Biribiara ankɔ so ankɔ.
How wonderful he is.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɔyɛ nwonwa.
I know there are risks.	Minim sɛ asiane ahorow wɔ hɔ.
They drive a car.	Wɔka kar.
I can’t believe it.	Me ntumi nnye nni.
I couldn’t understand that much.	Na mintumi nte saa asɛm no ase kɛse.
There were many police officers.	Ná polisifo pii wɔ hɔ.
Or maybe you will.	Anaasɛ ebia wobɛyɛ saa.
Remember them, everyone.	Kae wɔn, obiara.
It’s the perspective that counts.	Ɛyɛ adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ no na ɛyɛ ade a ɛho hia.
I'm with him.	Me ne no.
I thought we did that.	Misusuwii sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Turn them on if you can.	Sɛ wubetumi a, dan wɔn.
He was a problem later on for me.	Ɔyɛɛ ɔhaw akyiri yi maa me.
Do not use names.	Mfa din nni dwuma.
However, I was in too much pain to think clearly.	Nanso, na mete yaw dodo sɛ mintumi nsusuw nneɛma ho yiye.
Maybe you know, or maybe you were too young.	Ebia wunim, anaasɛ ebia na woyɛ abofra dodo.
The other guy can see that.	Ɔbarima foforo no tumi hu saa.
I hope it hurts.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛyɛ yaw.
So are investors.	Saa ara na wɔn a wɔde wɔn sika hyɛ mu no nso te.
It wasn’t too exciting.	Ná ɛnyɛ anigye dodo.
I didn’t have one.	Ná minni bi.
But you don’t know.	Nanso wunnim.
Not yours, not mine, his.	Ɛnyɛ wo de, ɛnyɛ me de, ne de.
You have so much stuff.	Wowɔ nneɛma pii saa.
I know you are stronger than you know.	Minim sɛ wo ho yɛ den sen sɛnea wunim.
Good, but still.	Eye, nanso saa ara.
I have so much to tell you.	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo.

Almost everyone does.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara yɛ saa.
But there is still real music.	Nanso nnwom ankasa da so ara wɔ hɔ.
If you’re happy, say so.	Sɛ w’ani gye a, ka saa.
Not in their happiness.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn anigye mu.
But perhaps it wasn’t much more interesting.	Nanso ebia na ɛnyɛ anigye pii sen saa.
It wasn’t really music.	Ná ɛnyɛ nnwom ankasa.
The time doesn’t matter to me.	Bere no mfa me ho.
His room with so much built up.	Ne dan a nneɛma pii asi wom no.
Even a good idea can be good.	Adwene pa mpo betumi ayɛ papa.
What were you doing last night?	Dɛn na na woreyɛ anadwo a etwaam no?
Maybe this happens to both of us.	Ebia eyi to yɛn baanu nyinaa.
There is nothing weird about my job.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ me adwuma no ho.
One cannot touch it.	Obi ntumi mfa ne nsa nka.
Or that’s the plan.	Anaasɛ ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no.
So this picture.	Enti saa mfonini yi.
He wants to be free.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho.
He was just a boy whose father forgets him.	Ná ɔyɛ abarimaa bi a ne papa werɛ fi no ara kwa.
And that things went wrong.	Na sɛ nneɛma kɔɔ bɔne.
In his age.	Wɔ ne mfe mu.
For a moment, the two stared at each other.	Bere tiaa bi no, wɔn baanu no hwɛɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho anim.
You don’t know what their situation is.	Wunnim sɛnea wɔn tebea te.
He introduced me to his friends.	Ɔde me kyerɛɛ ne nnamfo.
The kitten was malnourished and dehydrated.	Ná ɔkraman ba no nnya aduan pa nni na na nsu nni ne mu.
I know what it’s like.	Minim sɛnea ɛte.
Or they put it off altogether.	Anaasɛ wɔde to nkyɛn koraa.
He was by my side.	Ná ɔwɔ me nkyɛn.
Some of the stories were downright bizarre.	Ná nsɛm no bi yɛ nwonwa koraa.
I didn't mean to say it out loud.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea mepɛ sɛ meka no den.
Not after all this time.	Ɛnyɛ saa bere yi nyinaa akyi.
He might even be interested.	Ebia n’ani begye ho mpo.
We had a great team.	Ná yɛwɔ kuw kɛse bi.
And indeed, they do.	Na ampa ara, wɔyɛ saa.
These animals are endangered.	Saa mmoa yi wɔ asiane mu.
Surely a girl knew she was beautiful.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na abeawa bi nim sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He didn't know what to do next.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛyɛ akyi.
You can actually use both.	Wubetumi de abien no nyinaa adi dwuma ankasa.
And you are you.	Na woyɛ wo.
They had to tell him the truth.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka nokware kyerɛ no.
In the clothes.	Wɔ ntade no mu.
I did that last year.	Meyɛɛ saa afe a etwaam no.
It’s bad for you.	Ɛyɛ bɔne ma wo.
All work is done and accomplished.	Adwuma nyinaa yɛ na edi mu.
That was not their greatest joy.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɛno ne wɔn anigye kɛse.
A great girl.	Abeawa kɛse bi.
The man knows how to tell a story.	Ɔbarima no nim sɛnea wɔka asɛm bi.
Every day, in every situation.	Da biara da, wɔ tebea biara mu.
That was not his way.	Ná ɛnyɛ ne kwan na ɛte saa.
We are in one of those right now.	Yɛwɔ saa nneɛma no mu biako mu mprempren.
You want to do it that way, good for me.	Wopɛ sɛ woyɛ no saa, eye ma me.
It’s a mistake.	Ɛyɛ mfomso.
The results are very interesting.	Nea afi mu aba no yɛ anigye yiye.
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
It’s not as bad as you think.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne sɛnea wususuw no.
What do you think of the house?	Dɛn na wususuw wɔ ofie no ho?
It just has to be that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa ara kwa.
Winter or not, it seemed very cold.	Awɔw bere mu anaasɛ ɛnte saa no, na ɛte sɛ nea awɔw wom kɛse.
But your mom put money on that idea.	Nanso wo maame de sika too saa adwene no so.
I would have done that.	Anka mɛyɛ saa.
I hope he can do that though.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ obetumi ayɛ saa de.
He was always involved.	Ná ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu bere nyinaa.
You can have this on me.	Wubetumi anya eyi wɔ me so.
They all knew it.	Ná wɔn nyinaa nim.
We were there.	Ná yɛwɔ hɔ.
That is the most important thing.	Ɛno ne ade a ɛho hia sen biara.
I had a picture, and that was it.	Ná mewɔ mfonini bi, na ɛno ara ne no.
That almost never ends well.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno mma awiei yiye da.
He glanced at the empty street.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ abɔnten a hwee nni so no so.
Thank you so much for any help!.	Meda wo ase pii wɔ mmoa biara ho!.
I'm not too sure about that and.	Me nnim saa asɛm no yiye dodo na.
He knows me.	Onim me.
Anyone with any ideas.	Obiara a ɔwɔ adwene biara.
A few of them have it.	Wɔn mu kakraa bi wɔ bi.
But it wasn’t hard at all.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ den koraa.
Say what, it isn’t.	Ka nea, ɛnte saa.
I think there is a bit of work to be done.	Misusuw sɛ adwuma kakra bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
However, I’m happy.	Nanso, m’ani agye.
And he was strong.	Na ɔyɛ den.
But there was nothing.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ.
He himself did not know why he did this.	Ná ɔno ankasa nnim nea enti a ɔyɛɛ eyi.
Maybe not his wife, at least that was the case with me.	Ebia ɛnyɛ ne yere, anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na na ɛte wɔ me fam.
There are many people.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ.
You used it to run.	Wode dii dwuma de tu mmirika.
It wasn’t his character.	Na ɛnyɛ ne su.
They were just really good friends.	Ná wɔyɛ nnamfo pa ankasa ara kwa.
You know how good it used to be.	Wunim sɛnea kan no na eye.
But the words were not there.	Nanso na nsɛm no nni hɔ.
I don’t want that anymore.	Mempɛ saa bio.
He should be put aside.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde no to nkyɛn.
This is not that day.	Eyi nyɛ saa da no.
Friends tell each other everything.	Nnamfo ka biribiara kyerɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
I have to stay strong.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ den.
I had nothing to say.	Ná minni asɛm biara a mɛka.
But it’s not too bad.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bɔne dodo.
I don’t like anything.	M’ani nnye biribiara ho.
It’s all the same.	Ne nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
People are included.	Nnipa ka ho.
This dress is so expensive!	Saa atade yi bo yɛ den yiye!
Only we can handle it.	Yɛn nkutoo na yebetumi adi ho dwuma.
I’m worried about my sanity.	M’adwene mu da hɔ ho asɛm haw me.
Everything is on the table.	Biribiara wɔ pon no so.
Except it wasn’t.	Gye sɛ na ɛnte saa.
This is due to one or both of two factors.	Eyi fi nneɛma abien no mu biako anaa abien no nyinaa.
It’s been a long time.	Ɛyɛ bere tenten.
I didn’t know.	Ná minnim.
His head started pounding.	Ne ti fii ase bɔɔ denneennen.
I was worried about him.	Ná ne ho asɛm haw me.
There is a lot of water left.	Nsu pii aka.
Whatever he did, it had to be quick.	Nea na ɔbɛyɛ biara no, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛm.
This will solve the problem.	Eyi bedi ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
This sounds strange to many.	Eyi te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ma nnipa pii.
That is not true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware.
For me anyway.	Me deɛ ɔkwan biara so.
Little did he know that this would be something he would have to do.	Ná onnim sɛ eyi bɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
You have to be the whole team.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ kuw no nyinaa.
And that’s all there was to it.	Na ɛno ara ne nea na ɛwɔ hɔ.
This is a complete lie.	Eyi yɛ atoro koraa.
But there really was nothing for him.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ mma no ampa.
The accident shocked him deeply.	Akwanhyia no maa ne ho dwiriw no kɛse.
For any length of time.	Wɔ bere tenten biara mu.
You think it might be over now.	Wususuw sɛ ebia na aba awiei mprempren.
The same is true here.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ ha nso.
She is with a man.	Ɔne ɔbarima bi.
And it was a mistake.	Na ɛyɛ mfomso.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani gye ho saa.
I think of you immediately.	Misusuw wo ho ntɛm ara.
All things being equal.	Nneɛma nyinaa a ɛyɛ pɛ.
It’s not a mistake.	Ɛnyɛ mfomso.
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
I disagree with them.	Me ne wɔn nyɛ adwene.
That beautiful baby of yours.	Saa wo ba a ne ho yɛ fɛ no.
That’s a lot of money.	Ɛno yɛ sika pii.
Even one drop can be great.	Nsu biako mpo betumi ayɛ kɛse.
Think about music.	Susuw nnwom ho hwɛ.
It was amazing to do it.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ mɛyɛ.
I was feeling great this past weekend.	Na mete nka kɛse wɔ dapɛn awiei a atwam yi mu.
Expect delivery in three days.	Hwɛ kwan sɛ wɔde bɛma wɔ nnansa akyi.
Everyone expected the project to be someone else’s problem.	Ná obiara hwɛ kwan sɛ adwuma no bɛyɛ obi foforo haw.
He was too young.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra dodo.
Have a good hair day.	Na ti nhwi da pa.
It’s still there.	Ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
We can’t do anything.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ hwee.
That’s just human nature.	Ɛno ne onipa su ara kwa.
It’s pretty perfect.	Ɛyɛ fɛ a edi mũ.
The scenery here is amazing.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ ha no yɛ nwonwa.
I knew him well.	Ná minim no yiye.
That exposes even more people than before.	Ɛno ma nnipa pii mpo da adi sen kan no.
I didn’t want to go.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mekɔ.
I should have known he would.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
This is beautiful, isn’t it?	Eyi yɛ fɛ, ɛnte saa?
This is all a lot of work.	Eyi nyinaa yɛ adwuma kɛse.
They don’t seem quite so happy.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani nnye koraa saa.
Later in the season there is no danger.	Akyiri yi wɔ bere no mu no asiane biara nni hɔ.
You can’t get out of there.	Worentumi mfi hɔ.
You know these people.	Wunim saa nkurɔfo yi.
I don't know why he is so worried about this one girl.	Minnim nea enti a abeawa biako yi ho asɛm haw no saa.
We all had jobs.	Ná yɛn nyinaa wɔ nnwuma.
He is the only one who lives.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔte ase.
He was such a good dog.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔkraman pa saa.
Look at the background.	Hwɛ akyi no.
What the whole day had been.	Nea na da mũ no nyinaa ayɛ.
I expected it to be.	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
He never intended this to be the case.	Ná ɔnyɛ n’adwene da sɛ eyi yɛ saa.
The car was packed.	Ná kar no ayɛ ma.
He has my full support.	Ɔwɔ me mmoa a edi mũ.
Tomorrow, definitely, tomorrow.	Ɔkyena, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, ɔkyena.
Don’t get your hands on it.	Mma wo nsa nkɔ so.
But it’s something, maybe.	Nanso ɛyɛ biribi, ebia.
I handed him the phone.	Mede telefon no maa no.
I was among them.	Ná meka wɔn ho.
That is what this study is all about.	Ɛno ne nea adesua yi kyerɛ.
Look at your eyes.	Hwɛ w’ani so.
It seemed easy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I could handle that.	Ná metumi adi saa asɛm no ho dwuma.
What was that for? 	Ná ɛno ne dɛn?
They were amazing to us.	Ná wɔyɛ nwonwa ma yɛn.
I like them a lot.	M’ani gye wɔn ho kɛse.
For one thing, it’s a lot of work.	Ade biako ne sɛ, ɛyɛ adwuma pii.
Who knew he had it.	Hena na na onim sɛ ɔwɔ bi.
He could have it another day.	Ná obetumi anya bi da foforo.
However, that is not the end of the matter.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no awiei.
Something went completely wrong with this.	Biribi anyɛ yiye koraa wɔ eyi ho.
It’s very difficult.	Ɛyɛ den yiye.
A squirrel is a squirrel.	Ɔkraman yɛ ɔkraman.
He had to say what he knew.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka nea onim.
He gave each of us one half.	Ɔde fã biako maa yɛn mu biara.
First, this to me was the most important.	Nea edi kan no, na eyi ma me ne nea ɛho hia sen biara.
It was simple, but it was there.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw, nanso na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Even the strongest ones.	Wɔn a wɔn ho yɛ den mpo.
There is no mental restructuring involved.	Adwene mu nhyehyɛe foforo biara nni mu.
Someone like you.	Obi te sɛ wo.
It’s good fun.	Ɛyɛ anigye pa.
In the meantime, people know.	Saa bere yi mu no, nkurɔfo nim.
Two others were dependent on me.	Ná nnipa baanu foforo nso de wɔn ho to me so.
My father is still a little worried.	Me papa da so ara haw kakra.
What an ending.	Awiei bɛn ara ni.
This is a staggering number.	Eyi yɛ dodow a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Let him go again.	Ma no nkɔ bio.
What is happening is happening.	Nea ɛrekɔ so no rekɔ so.
But he was the same man he is today.	Nanso na ɔyɛ ɔbarima koro no ara a ɔte nnɛ no.
The desire touched everyone there.	Ɔpɛ no kaa obiara a ɔwɔ hɔ no.
It looked strange on her, like something a child would do.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ne so, te sɛ biribi a abofra bɛyɛ.
He wasn’t real.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi ankasa.
Whatever it is.	Nea ɛyɛ biara.
I wanted to stay strong for him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ den ma no.
What kind of city is this?	Kurow bɛn na eyi yɛ?
Use them for yourself.	Fa wɔn di dwuma.
Perhaps part of it did.	Ebia ne fã bi yɛɛ saa.
It was a good job to do.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma pa a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
And take it one day at a time.	Na fa no da koro biara.
He, who was a	Ɔno, a na ɔyɛ
It was to be another one of his tests.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ne sɔhwɛ ahorow no mu biako foforo.
But he immediately liked it.	Nanso ntɛm ara na n’ani gyee ho.
However, I’m interested.	Nanso, m’ani gye ho.
I’m too interested in things.	M’ani gye nneɛma ho dodo.
Everyone seemed to know each other.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obiara nim ne ho.
What he says is true.	Nea ɔka no te saa.
There was another person in the room.	Na onipa foforo nso wɔ dan no mu.
I know he was like that.	Minim sɛ na ɔte saa.
But his legs are really weak.	Nanso ne nan yɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
We don’t have to be part of that.	Ɛho nhia sɛ yɛyɛ saa asɛm no fã.
He had to do something about it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ho biribi.
But not this group.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa kuw yi.
They are very bad people.	Wɔyɛ nnipa bɔne paa.
None of us have ever done that.	Yɛn mu biara nyɛɛ saa da.
But there is no one.	Nanso obiara nni hɔ.
Someone came to the door.	Obi baa ɔpon no ano.
Somehow he always does.	Ɔkwan bi so no ɔyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
If it works.	Sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a.
They don’t like each other very much.	Wɔn ani nnye wɔn ho wɔn ho ho kɛse.
Good old days indeed.	Nna pa dedaw ampa.
Go on, play it.	Kɔ so, bɔ no.
I know you were doing some work.	Minim sɛ na woreyɛ adwuma bi.
I just know it’s beautiful out here.	Minim ara sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ ha akyi.
So that was part of the day.	Enti na ɛno yɛ da no fã.
Spend the time however you like.	Fa bere no di dwuma sɛnea wopɛ biara.
He knew the game.	Ná onim agoru no.
Why should they do that.	Dɛn nti na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
This was all his fault.	Ná eyi nyinaa yɛ ne mfomso.
Is that what it really is.	So ɛno ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Otherwise, it feels like you have everything under control.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛte sɛ nea wowɔ biribiara so tumi.
It would be a chapter he accidentally stepped on.	Ɛbɛyɛ ti bi a ɔde ne nan sii so wɔ akwanhyia mu.
There is much work to be done.	Adwuma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
That will continue.	Ɛno bɛkɔ so.
Whatever he had done.	Nea na wayɛ biara.
Make sure it’s easy.	Hwɛ hu sɛ ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
But what has happened has happened.	Nanso nea asi no aba.
I thought he knew it all.	Misusuwii sɛ na onim ne nyinaa.
That will end tomorrow.	Ɛno bɛba awiei ɔkyena.
I know how he works.	Minim sɛnea ɔyɛ adwuma.
You are someone who is there.	Wo ne obi a ɔwɔ hɔ.
He would arrange it.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
But keep running.	Nanso kɔ so tu mmirika.
A very soft, warm hand caressed his arm.	Nsa bi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye a ɛyɛ hyew de ne nsa bɔɔ ne nsa.
The present case is the latter.	Mprempren asɛm no yɛ nea etwa to no.
There was work to be done.	Ná adwuma wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
People often find that they don’t care about money.	Mpɛn pii no, nkurɔfo hu sɛ sika ho nhia wɔn.
I really can’t see it.	Ankasa mintumi nhu.
You know your hair.	Wunim wo ti nhwi.
That would be amazing.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nwonwa.
But, you know better.	Nanso, wo de, wunim yiye.
Stay right there.	Tra hɔ ara.
Check out the details!.	Hwɛ nsɛm no!.
Time did it.	Bere yɛɛ saa.
He is quite a mature man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho akokwaw koraa.
The police were taken into a crowd.	Wɔde polisifo no kɔɔ nnipa pii mu.
We can’t tell.	Yɛrentumi nhu.
The scenery is beautiful.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ fɛ yiye.
And that makes me happier than anything.	Na ɛno ma m’ani gye sen biribiara.
Much of the work has been done.	Wɔde adwuma no ayɛ adwuma no fã kɛse no ara.
You are there for me.	Wowɔ hɔ ma me.
And you got to survive.	Na wo nyaa nkwa.
It’s not a sin.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne.
That is their plan.	Ɛno ne wɔn nhyehyɛe.
No one else knows about the child yet.	Obi foforo biara nnim abofra no ho asɛm de besi nnɛ.
I need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
None of the buses were overcrowded.	Ná bɔs no mu biara nni hɔ a nnipa ahyɛ mu ma dodo.
He could go further now.	Ná obetumi akɔ akyiri mprempren.
They were really into it.	Ná wɔde wɔn ho ahyɛ mu ankasa.
It’s been amazing.	Ayɛ nwonwa.
He was here last night.	Ná ɔwɔ ha anadwo a etwaam no.
It’s a beautiful day.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ fɛ.
So, look at the whole thing.	Enti, hwɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
It was very cold, too.	Ná awɔw wom paa, nso.
It works like a door.	Ɛyɛ adwuma te sɛ ɔpon.
It is still the same now.	Ɛda so ara te saa ara mprempren.
Many of us rode bikes here.	Yɛn mu pii de sakre kɔɔ ha.
However, that wasn’t the first collision.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea edi kan a wɔde wɔn ho bɔɔ mu.
He was on a race bike.	Ná ɔte sakre a wɔde tu mmirika so.
It’s a huge mistake.	Ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
That in itself has been great.	Ɛno ankasa ayɛ kɛse.
The children have traveled from school.	Mmofra no atu kwan afi sukuu.
The same is true of this one.	Saa ara na eyi nso te.
And so it sat there in the basement.	Na enti na ɛte hɔ wɔ dan no ase.
Everything seemed very difficult.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara yɛ den yiye.
He is in school.	Ɔwɔ sukuu mu.
Again, I'm sorry about that.	Bio nso, mepa wo kyɛw wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Probably not in the recent past.	Ebia ɛnyɛ nnansa yi bere a atwam no mu.
It’s something all my kids love.	Ɛyɛ biribi a me mma nyinaa ani gye ho.
At least someone did.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, obi yɛɛ saa.
We were never supposed to be perfect.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ pɛ da.
Be quick, or you’ll be late for work!	Yɛ ntɛm, anyɛ saa a wobɛka akyi wɔ adwuma mu!
It should be a better plan than what you are currently doing.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe a eye sen nea woreyɛ mprempren no.
You need to know that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu saa.
And a little bit more .	Na kakra bi nso .
No one knows when.	Obiara nnim bere bɛn.
And the best of all.	Na nea eye sen biara.
It’s really, really hot.	Ɛyɛ hyew ankasa, ankasa.
You just don’t do that.	Wonyɛ saa ara kwa.
He doesn’t want to take it any further.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde kɔ akyiri bio.
That fails to see the point.	Ɛno ntumi nhu asɛm no.
He is a man of intelligence.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔwɔ nyansa.
The available literature is discussed.	Wɔka nhoma ahorow a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho asɛm.
But there was also this other girl.	Nanso na abeawa foforo yi nso wɔ hɔ.
He might say more.	Ebia na ɔbɛka pii.
It’s a beautiful moment, indeed.	Ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ fɛ, ampa.
Not really new stuff.	Ɛnyɛ nneɛma foforo ankasa.
The game was simple.	Ná agoru no yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
We use our minds to create stories.	Yɛde yɛn adwene di dwuma de bɔ nsɛm.
He gave us everything we had.	Ɔde biribiara a yɛwɔ maa yɛn.
But that goes for everything out there.	Nanso ɛno kɔ ma biribiara a ɛwɔ abɔnten hɔ.
Tell me why that is.	Ka nea enti a ɛte saa kyerɛ me.
Not that it will be much better.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ papa pii.
Such things to say.	Nsɛm a ɛte saa a ɛsɛ sɛ woka.
Not happy with the situation.	Ɛnyɛ anigye wɔ tebea no ho.
Someone else had seen it.	Ná obi foforo nso ahu.
A new song has been added.	Wɔde dwom foforo bi aka ho.
It was one of the best.	Ná ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara no mu biako.
I tell you this.	Meka eyi kyerɛ mo.
They are so good.	Wɔyɛ papa saa.
He had no language.	Ná onni kasa biara.
He has his book in progress.	Ɔwɔ ne nhoma no rekɔ so.
Some animals migrate.	Mmoa bi tu kɔ baabi foforo.
And a nice one at that.	Na obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
The past is past.	Bere a atwam no atwam.
That was terrible.	Ná ɛno yɛ hu.
It is used for hot food.	Wɔde di dwuma de yɛ aduan a ɛyɛ hyew.
If there are people.	Sɛ nnipa wɔ hɔ a.
I did him wrong.	Meyɛɛ no ​​bɔne.
Self is important here for two reasons.	Nneɛma abien nti na ankasa ho hia wɔ ha.
When the going gets tough, the tough gets going.	Sɛ kɔ no yɛ den a, nea ɛyɛ den no kɔ so.
Your momma should be home soon.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo momma bɛba fie nnansa yi ara.
We used to do that.	Ná yɛyɛ saa.
How can I keep doing this.	Mɛyɛ dɛn akɔ so ayɛ eyi.
Dinner is served.	Wɔde anwummere aduan ma.
You have to deal with everyone else.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne obiara a aka no di nsɛm.
Not much water.	Ɛnyɛ nsu pii.
I wish we could do that.	Me yam a anka yebetumi ayɛ saa.
This is also a lie.	Eyi nso yɛ atoro.
There is simply nothing.	Biribiara nni hɔ ara kwa.
And the next night.	Na anadwo a edi hɔ no.
You need to work on that now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa ho adwuma mprempren.
The first is the work phase.	Nea edi kan ne adwuma no fã.
And maybe a lot more.	Na ebia pii nso.
People tend to show more support.	Nkurɔfo taa da mmoa adi kɛse.
It’s just amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
I'll go with him.	Me ne no bɛkɔ.
Believe me, there are enough of them.	Gye me di, dodow a ɛdɔɔso wɔ hɔ.
I came here by bus.	Mede bɔs baa ha.
Keep running, and keep their heads down.	Kɔ so tu mmirika, na momma wɔn ti nkɔ fam.
Feel.	Te nka.
It’s part of the game.	Ɛyɛ agoru no fã.
The schools close.	Sukuu ahorow no to mu.
They all go back down.	Wɔn nyinaa san kɔ fam.
There is a girl there.	Abeawa bi wɔ hɔ.
He was a wonderful child.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I could hardly believe it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nnye nni.
I love them both.	M’ani gye wɔn baanu nyinaa ho.
None of this actually happened.	Eyi mu biara amma ankasa.
He seemed to be focused on something else.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔde n’adwene asi biribi foforo so.
I really didn’t want to go.	Ankasa na mempɛ sɛ mekɔ.
He felt the same way about me.	Ɔno nso tee nka saa ara wɔ me ho.
They were the ones that mattered.	Wɔn na na ɛho hia.
That is the truth.	Ɛno ne nokware no.
Good lunch plans.	Awia aduan ho nhyehyɛe pa.
This does work.	Eyi yɛ adwuma ampa.
I used this method.	Mede saa kwan yi dii dwuma.
He slipped his clothes on.	Ɔde ne ntade no bɔɔ so.
It wasn’t supposed to be.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
I am very pleased with the work presented.	M’ani gye adwuma a wɔde ama no ho kɛse.
Clearly, it is not.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
He told us he didn’t know anything.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ onnim hwee.
So maybe that would have been a better thing.	Enti ebia na ɛno bɛyɛ ade a eye sen saa.
Somewhere inside him, something hurts.	Wɔ ne mu baabi no, biribi yɛ no yaw.
Nothing too fancy.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ fɛ dodo.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Say what you see.	Ka nea wuhu no.
In my room.	Wɔ me dan mu.
That is the nature of man.	Ɛno ne onipa su.
All more about our city.	Yɛn kurow no ho nsɛm pii nyinaa.
You look amazing in all these pictures.	Wo ho yɛ nwonwa wɔ mfonini ahorow yi nyinaa mu.
I wanted him to go with us.	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔne yɛn kɔ.
He follows the same routine every day.	Odi nhyehyɛe koro no ara akyi da biara.
This whole process is starting to look too complicated for me.	Saa kwan yi nyinaa fi ase hwɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den dodo ma me.
Mom and dad have been absolutely amazing.	Maame ne papa ayɛ nwonwa koraa.
This was no longer true.	Ná eyi nyɛ nokware bio.
His hands on her.	Ne nsa a ɔde too ne so.
Be sure to tell us how beautiful we are.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wobɛka sɛnea yɛn ho yɛ fɛ no akyerɛ yɛn.
And you have to do that.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I thought no one knew about my identity.	Misusuwii sɛ obiara nnim me ho a onim ho asɛm.
Now that’s not entirely true.	Seesei ɛno nyɛ nokware koraa.
The best schools.	Sukuu ahorow a eye sen biara.
And this is my home.	Na eyi ne me fie.
He was really there.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Maybe he was doing something.	Ebia na ɔyɛ ade bi.
The figure shows the problem.	Mfonini no kyerɛ ɔhaw no.
Kids love to ride bikes to school.	Mmofra ani gye sakre so de kɔ sukuu ho.
This makes me us now.	Eyi ma meyɛ yɛn mprempren.
In time, this will lead to problems.	Bere bi akyi no, eyi de ɔhaw ahorow bɛba.
I just wanted you to know that it’s okay to do that.	Na mepɛ sɛ wuhu kɛkɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
He wanted a big house and a nice car.	Ná ɔpɛ ofie kɛse ne kar a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I need to get to know him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no.
You don’t know what’s going on.	Wunnim nea ɛrekɔ so.
But not for food.	Nanso ɛnyɛ aduan nti.
Another idea for me.	Adwene foforo ma me.
It seems that.	Ɛte sɛ nea.
Talk about being uncomfortable.	Ka sɛnea wo ho nyɛ wo den ho asɛm.
Everyone lies to me.	Obiara di atoro kyerɛ me.
Don’t be afraid of yourself.	Mma wo ho nyɛ wo yaw.
It doesn’t surprise me.	Ɛnyɛ me nwonwa.
He just exists.	Ɔwɔ hɔ ara kwa.
That’s not terrible though.	Ɛno nyɛ hu de, nanso.
The same is true of the man.	Saa ara na ɔbarima no nso te.
He was so much fun to be around.	Ná ɔyɛ anigye kɛse sɛ ɔbɛka ne ho.
Hardly anyone ever went there.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara ankɔ hɔ da.
Go back outside.	San kɔ abɔnten.
And that’s everything, you know.	Na ɛno ne biribiara, wunim.
However, there is no doubt.	Nanso, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ.
He was completely human now.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa koraa mprempren.
A nice and smooth car.	Kar a ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Good ideas.	Adwene pa.
I knew what it was like.	Ná minim sɛnea ɛte.
And he will be	Na ɔbɛyɛ .
He walked me to school every day.	Ná ɔde me nantew kɔ sukuu da biara.
He wanted her day and night.	Ná ɔpɛ no awia ne anadwo.
We were very excited.	Ná yɛn ani agye yiye.
He can take his own.	Obetumi de ne de akɔ.
Here's a better one.	Nea eye sen saa ni.
He was a bad guy.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa bɔne.
They must have made this decision on their own.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ wɔn ankasa asi saa gyinae yi.
There are different opinions.	Adwene ahorow wɔ hɔ.
He seems unaware of the situation.	Ɛte sɛ nea onnim tebea no ho hwee.
Summer and winter, day and night.	Awɔw bere ne awɔw bere, awia ne anadwo.
That means it was really expensive.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ na ne bo yɛ den ankasa.
That was just amazing.	Ná ɛno yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
And just, you know.	Na kɛkɛ, wunim.
After all, he was very young.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
The first day, no one saw the letter.	Da a edi kan no, obiara anhu krataa no.
He lives in a different state.	Ɔte tebea foforo mu.
It had the same features.	Ná ɛwɔ nneɛma koro no ara.
He hits the hat and it’s short.	Ɔbɔ kyɛw no na ɛyɛ tiaa.
That would be a pretty big deal.	Ɛno bɛyɛ asɛm kɛse a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I don’t want to talk about him.	Mempɛ sɛ meka ne ho asɛm.
Or your feet.	Anaasɛ wo nan.
However, this is not entirely true.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
I couldn’t understand them.	Ná mintumi nte wɔn ase.
However, I could be wrong.	Nanso, metumi adi mfomso.
I need to work on my arms today.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ me nsa ho adwuma nnɛ.
Do your test now, he told her.	Yɛ wo sɔhwɛ no mprempren, ɔka kyerɛɛ no.
You can do wonderful things with it, help people.	Wubetumi de ayɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa, aboa nkurɔfo.
Go, my son.	Kɔ, me ba.
I just realize that time is short.	Mihu ara kwa sɛ bere yɛ tiaa.
I knew something was up.	Ná minim sɛ biribi rekɔ so.
I have created a problem for myself.	Mede ɔhaw bi ahyɛ me ho.
For me, it was a big mistake.	Wɔ me fam no, na ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
What a problem this is.	Hwɛ ɔhaw bɛn ara ni.
I wasn’t much help.	Ná menyɛ mmoa pii.
A beautiful house.	Ofie a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Like the weekend before the final.	Te sɛ dapɛn awiei ansa na nea etwa to no aba.
You can use the article to help.	Wubetumi de asɛm no aboa.
Many forms of entertainment are dangerous.	Nneɛma pii a wɔde gye wɔn ani no yɛ nea asiane wom.
He sits there while he works.	Ɔte hɔ bere a ɔreyɛ adwuma no.
I don’t have to do anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi.
You can do that immediately in your system.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa adwuma no ntɛm ara wɔ wo nhyehyɛe no mu.
It is my opinion that this approach is wrong.	Ɛyɛ m’adwene sɛ saa kwan yi yɛ mfomso.
I would have said that.	Anka mɛka saa.
It wasn’t just my eyes that had gone.	Ɛnyɛ m’ani nkutoo na na akɔ.
There is only one thing I don’t have.	Ade biako pɛ na minni.
There is a lot of water in it.	Nsu pii wɔ ho.
The same is true for most people.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nnipa dodow no ara fam.
Do the new thing.	Yɛ ade foforo no.
There is heavy traffic in the morning and afternoon.	Kar pii kɔ hɔ anɔpa ne awia.
Your statement is false.	Wo asɛm no yɛ atoro.
It is certainly a very dangerous business.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a asiane wom yiye.
We had to make a better plan.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nhyehyɛe a eye sen saa.
It was home for both of us.	Ná ɛyɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa fie.
And another thing .	Na ade foforo nso .
Help and support.	Mmoa ne mmoa a wɔde ma.
He looked like a man.	Ná ɔte sɛ ɔbarima.
You would all be better off.	Anka mo nyinaa bɛyɛ yiye.
Man, that was great!	Onipa, na ɛno yɛ kɛse!
He was quite young.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
That’s what he focused on.	Ɛno ne nea ɔde n’adwene sii so.
There was a large man in the foreground.	Ná ɔbarima kɛse bi wɔ anim.
He didn’t work with anyone.	Ná ɔne obiara nyɛ adwuma.
You brought it home and showed it to me.	Wode baa fie na wode kyerɛɛ me.
You looked amazing that night.	Wo ho yɛɛ wo nwonwa saa anadwo no.
And they tell each other everything.	Na wɔka biribiara kyerɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
The latter is new to me, and very strange.	Nea etwa to no yɛ foforo ma me, na ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
There are so many things you can do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
My dad tells him, most everyone locked the front door.	Me papa ka kyerɛ no, obiara dodow no ara too anim pon no mu.
The police took him into custody.	Polisifo de no too afiase.
He, too, had some things to do.	Ɔno nso, na ɔwɔ nneɛma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
It’s actually pretty cool.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
How many years.	Mfe dodow ahe.
People had even brought their children.	Ná nkurɔfo de wɔn mma mpo aba.
Most moms do that.	Maame dodow no ara yɛ saa.
That was true.	Ná ɛno yɛ nokware.
What you have now is cheap and good quality.	Nea wowɔ mprempren no bo nyɛ den na ɛyɛ papa.
He had no problem with that.	Ná onni ɔhaw biara wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Definitely better.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eye sen saa.
His car runs good.	Ne kar no tu mmirika yiye.
His problem is more serious.	Ne haw no mu yɛ den sen saa.
It was a great moment for the club.	Ná ɛyɛ bere kɛse ma kurow no.
Everyone knew that water had to flow down.	Ná obiara nim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ nsu sen ba fam.
Always remember yourself.	Kae wo ho bere nyinaa.
I love that kid.	M’ani gye saa abofra no ho.
However, I believe this will happen quickly.	Nanso, migye di sɛ eyi bɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
I can talk about it.	Metumi aka ho asɛm.
It’s the best view of the whole year.	Ɛyɛ ade a eye sen biara a wubetumi ahu wɔ afe mũ no nyinaa mu.
Maybe it’s a game we can enjoy.	Ebia ɛyɛ agoru a yebetumi anya mu anigye.
The last point is clear.	Asɛm a etwa to no mu da hɔ.
The latter was the best.	Nea etwa to no na eye sen biara.
There was no one like him.	Ná obiara nni hɔ a ɔte sɛ ɔno.
It should be any door.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔpon biara.
You are in a very dangerous situation where you are.	Wowɔ tebea a asiane wom kɛse mu wɔ baabi a wowɔ no.
The winter ended the drought.	Awɔw bere no maa ɔpɛ no baa awiei.
He was mentally retarded.	Ná n’adwene ntumi nyɛ adwuma yiye.
In any case.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no.
However, this is not the case.	Nanso, eyi nte saa.
We all have something in common.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ biribi a ɛyɛ pɛ.
It’s an inside story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛwɔ mu.
He never had an issue.	Ná onni asɛm biara da.
It’s the best of the best.	Ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
I can’t imagine it.	Mintumi nsusuw ho.
I was a human being.	Ná meyɛ onipa.
Beware of it soon.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ ho ntɛm.
Still, it’s beautiful.	Nanso, ɛda so ara yɛ fɛ.
I can’t talk about that.	Mintumi nka saa asɛm no ho asɛm.
His old pictures.	Ne mfonini ahorow dedaw no.
Nevertheless, the police have yet to take action.	Ne nyinaa mu no, polisifo nnya nyɛɛ ho hwee.
So that’s it, he told himself.	Enti ɛno ne no, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho.
I also love the pictures.	M’ani gye mfonini ahorow no nso ho.
Take me now.	Fa me mprempren.
And he would go, too.	Na ɔno nso bɛkɔ.
I actually did that.	Meyɛɛ saa ankasa.
It would actually be quite easy.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa ankasa.
I am really sorry about this.	Mepa wo kyɛw ankasa wɔ eyi ho.
I heard you say something.	Metee sɛ woka biribi.
There was a letter inside.	Ná krataa bi wɔ mu.
You are such a good boy.	Woyɛ abarimaa pa saa.
He had no idea in those words.	Na onni adwene wɔ saa nsɛm no mu.
You’re the one who does that.	Wo na woyɛ saa.
This is all right here.	Eyi nyinaa wɔ ha yi ara.
It’s not about real time.	Ɛnyɛ bere ankasa ho asɛm.
He was hopeless, behind the pale face.	Ná onni anidaso biara, na na ɔwɔ anim a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no akyi.
But an accident happened.	Nanso akwanhyia bi sii.
So at least here is your chance.	Enti anyɛ yiye koraa no, hokwan a wowɔ ni.
You go out with them.	Wo ne wɔn fi adi.
Things are interesting here.	Nneɛma yɛ anigye wɔ ha.
It seems a little strange now.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra mprempren.
But it wasn’t the same thing.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ade koro no ara ne saa.
Otherwise, the whole thing is completely off him.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ade mũ no nyinaa fi ne so koraa.
Maybe it doesn’t have to be money.	Ebia ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ sika.
This picture is really important.	Saa mfonini yi ho hia ankasa.
Get out of it.	Fi mu.
I had to do something about him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ne ho biribi.
Start as soon as you can.	Fi ase sɛnea wubetumi.
I want to know.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu.
Next again from.	Nea edi hɔ bio fi.
Can you help.	So wubetumi aboa.
He kicked under the front door.	Ɔde ne nan bɔɔ anim pon no ase.
Make no mistake about this.	Nni mfomso biara wɔ eyi ho.
The literature was never about that last category.	Ná nhoma ahorow no mfa saa kuw a etwa to no ho da.
I wasn’t interested in it.	Ná m’ani nnye ho.
The hands are weak.	Nsa no ayɛ mmerɛw.
We are just there.	Yɛwɔ hɔ ara kwa.
I told him that.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​saa.
This was very difficult for me.	Ná eyi yɛ den ma me paa.
I’m pretty happy right now.	M’ani agye yiye mprempren.
The problem was, he didn’t know what to do.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ, na onnim nea ɔnyɛ.
You have to work on yourself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wo ho adwuma.
He didn’t have a car.	Ná onni kar.
That’s what he knew.	Ɛno ne nea na onim.
I have a plan.	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe bi.
His legs hurt.	Ná ne nan yɛ no yaw.
He doesn’t do that.	Ɔnyɛ saa.
And that doesn’t matter either.	Na ɛno nso nyɛ hwee.
That’s the way it is for me.	Saa na ɛte ma me.
He is doing his best.	Ɔreyɛ nea obetumi biara.
We all care about each other.	Yɛn nyinaa ho hia yɛn.
Make him feel better today.	Ma ho nyɛ no yiye nnɛ.
Water usually evaporates very quickly.	Mpɛn pii no, nsu tu ntɛmntɛm paa.
This is another big one.	Eyi yɛ kɛse foforo.
You don’t want to tell me, you don’t have to.	Wompɛ sɛ woka kyerɛ me, ɛnsɛ sɛ woka kyerɛ me.
If not a door, there is a window somewhere.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɔpon a, mfɛnsere wɔ baabi.
However, this idea sat well with me.	Nanso, saa adwene yi traa ase yiye wɔ me ho.
I am a quick worker.	Meyɛ obi a ɔyɛ adwuma ntɛmntɛm.
I know your services are very expensive.	Minim sɛ mo nnwuma no bo yɛ den yiye.
Or a party.	Anaasɛ apontow bi.
The next evening will be the first real test.	Anwummere a edi hɔ no bɛyɛ sɔhwɛ a edi kan ankasa.
He had some money.	Ná ɔwɔ sika kakra.
They took him through to me.	Wɔde no faa mu kɔɔ me nkyɛn.
That may be difficult.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ den.
It was his book.	Ná ɛyɛ ne nhoma.
That somehow costs nothing.	Sɛ ɔkwan bi so no, ɛho ka biara nni ho.
Best to do it on the road.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ no wɔ kwan so.
And, say .	Na, ka sɛ .
With one input.	Ne nsɛm biako a wɔde hyɛ mu.
And you don’t like the boy.	Na w’ani nnye abarimaa no ho.
And everything tells the story.	Na biribiara ka asɛm no.
The characters were real.	Ná nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no yɛ nnipa ankasa.
The same thought was in the minds of both of them.	Ná adwene koro no ara wɔ wɔn baanu nyinaa adwene mu.
I just wanted to be a kid.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ abofra kɛkɛ.
Most of the time, he was alone.	Mpɛn pii no, na ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
Lunch at home.	Awia aduan wɔ fie.
No need to put anyone at risk just yet.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode obiara to asiane mu mprempren ara.
This should be done as well.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi nso.
He was well aware of that.	Ná onim saa asɛm no yiye.
It was completely drenched.	Ná nsu ayɛ no ma koraa.
You can’t really make them happy.	Worentumi mma wɔn ani nnye ankasa.
There is no one to help us.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔbɛboa yɛn.
This is widely accepted.	Eyi yɛ nea nnipa pii gye tom.
It just gets better.	Ɛyɛ yiye ara kwa.
At least not this morning.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ anɔpa yi.
Go to them.	Kɔ wɔn nkyɛn.
This should be a	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ a
Take time to plan your meals.	Gye bere yɛ wo aduan ho nhyehyɛe.
You can’t have that.	Worentumi nnya saa.
And do it yourself.	Na yɛ no ankasa.
You got my attention.	Wo nyaa m’adwene.
It was there for three years.	Ná ɛwɔ hɔ mfe abiɛsa.
It’s not about me.	Ɛnyɛ me ho asɛm.
It felt painful.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ yaw.
Maybe I do that.	Ebia meyɛ saa.
This is not a.	Eyi nyɛ a.
And he sighed in pain.	Na ɔde yaw bɔɔ ne mu ase.
Act now, before it’s too late!	Yɛ ade mprempren, ansa na aka akyi dodo!
I need to get used to this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi ho su.
Look at a picture or picture of yourself.	Hwɛ wo ho mfonini anaa mfonini bi.
You end everything.	Wode biribiara ba awiei.
But it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛnyɛ hwee.
So we have something in common.	Enti yɛwɔ biribi a ɛyɛ pɛ.
I just can’t get used to it.	Nea ɛyɛ ara ne sɛ mintumi nyɛ ho su.
This should work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma.
Being late again is not good for reputation.	Sɛ́ obi bɛka akyi bio no nyɛ papa mma din pa.
He is with us.	Ɔka yɛn ho.
Just a little bit.	Kakraa bi pɛ.
But not you, boy.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wo, abarimaa.
He is such a nice guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa a ɔte saa.
You are so beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Everyone there knew at least one other person.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na obiara a ɔwɔ hɔ no nim onipa foforo biako.
It was truly amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa ampa.
New, new, new!	Sika, sika, sika!
Which hurts him.	Nea ɛyɛ ne ho yaw.
The absence of his father was nothing new.	Ná ne papa a na onni hɔ no nyɛ ade foforo.
Thank you so much ever.	Meda mo ase pii da.
I think that’s why everyone likes him.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno nti na obiara ani gye ne ho no.
In these cases you were.	Wɔ saa nsɛm yi mu no na woreyɛ.
And make no mistakes.	Na nni mfomso biara.
It may be a little bit.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ kakraa bi.
I understand it very well.	Mete ase yiye.
I don’t know what else to do.	Minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ bio.
I don’t have to make the mistake again.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ mfomso no bio.
Every time it’s the same thing.	Bere biara a ɛyɛ ade koro no ara.
And more importantly.	Na nea ɛho hia kɛse no nso.
On.	So.
He liked himself for it.	N’ani gyee ne ho wɔ ho.
. . . .	.
I wasn’t busy.	Ná minni adagyew.
Their home was my home.	Ná wɔn fie yɛ me fie.
If one has no clothes.	Sɛ obi nni atade.
He wanted money.	Ná ɔpɛ sika.
I can't believe he really has to be mine.	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ me de ankasa.
It was enough enough.	Ná ɛdɔɔso a ɛdɔɔso.
Or both of us.	Anaasɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa.
The truth always comes to an end.	Nokware no ba awiei bere nyinaa.
The team has an important game this weekend.	Kuw no wɔ agoru bi a ɛho hia dapɛn awiei yi.
And he had taken advantage of this hope.	Na na ɔde saa anidaso yi adi dwuma.
The sooner you do it the better.	Dodow a woyɛ no ntɛmntɛm no, dodow no ara na eye.
And that meant there was no help.	Na ɛno kyerɛ sɛ na mmoa biara nni hɔ.
Another boy takes it.	Abarimaa foforo nso fa.
The hands that still worked.	Nsa a na ɛda so ara yɛ adwuma no.
Or not just the accident.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ akwanhyia no nkutoo.
I loved my new chapter.	M’ani gyee me ti foforo no ho.
He seemed to forget where he was in the story.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne werɛ fii baabi a ɔwɔ wɔ asɛm no mu.
But you know it’s happening.	Nanso wunim sɛ ɛrekɔ so.
You have two issues.	Wowɔ nsɛm abien.
He is only one man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima biako pɛ.
He was quite young.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
Later, after that.	Akyiri yi, ɛno akyi.
That can really add up over time.	Ɛno betumi aka ho ankasa bere a bere kɔ so no.
Everything had worked fine last night.	Ná biribiara ayɛ adwuma yiye anadwo a etwaam no.
Half of them are children.	Wɔn mu fã yɛ mmofra.
If you want something, work for it.	Sɛ wopɛ biribi a, yɛ adwuma ma no.
Put him in the picture.	Fa no to mfonini no mu.
I see it.	Mihu mu.
It might be interesting.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
Can you describe those qualities?	So wubetumi aka saa su ahorow no ho asɛm?
You bring them in as your help.	Wode wɔn ba sɛ wo mmoa.
I just wanted to forget about it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me werɛ fi ho ara kwa.
That’s happened.	Ɛno asi.
It’s not that we don’t like you.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ yɛn ani nnye wo ho.
But there are many more.	Nanso pii wɔ hɔ.
However, I really enjoyed it.	Nanso, m’ani gyee ho yiye.
She never wants to be touched in this state.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa bɛka no wɔ tebea yi mu da.
I really like that.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho ampa.
Tell me more about that book.	Ka saa nhoma no ho nsɛm pii kyerɛ me.
But that’s another story.	Nanso ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo.
There is nothing to be done.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
At the time it seemed really exciting.	Saa bere no na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
He didn't seem to realize how much trouble this could cause.	Ɛte sɛ nea na onnim ɔhaw dodow a eyi betumi de aba.
I could have easily guided him in from there.	Anka ɛnyɛ den sɛ metumi afi hɔ akyerɛ no kwan akɔ mu.
And it wasn’t surprising.	Na ɛnyɛ nwonwa.
It’s your child.	Ɛyɛ wo ba no.
It’s not life for you.	Ɛnyɛ nkwa mma wo.
The one-child policy was a disaster.	Ná abofra biako nhyehyɛe no yɛ asiane.
Make a plan.	Yɛ nhyehyɛe.
Take the kids to the park.	Fa mmofra no kɔ abɔnten so.
I can’t say it has that.	Mintumi nka sɛ ɛwɔ saa.
You really want to know how the story ends.	Wopɛ sɛ wuhu sɛnea asɛm no ba awiei ankasa.
I had the same one, over and over again.	Ná mewɔ biako koro no ara, mpɛn pii.
There is no reason to do so.	Biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Not on words.	Ɛnyɛ nsɛm so.
How to deliver it.	Sɛnea wɔde bɛma.
That was a former.	Ná ɛno yɛ kan.
I agree with you.	Me ne wo yɛ adwene.
He is a human being.	Ɔyɛ onipa.
It’s not going to work.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛrekɔ adwuma.
That wasn’t the point.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
I did have help with the kids.	Na mewɔ mmoa wɔ mmofra no ho ampa.
He had many wonderful qualities.	Ná ɔwɔ su ahorow pii a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I don’t know why that is.	Me nnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Maybe he didn’t understand them either.	Ebia na ɔno nso nte wɔn ase.
There was no mistake.	Ná mfomso biara nni hɔ.
I hope it will be soon.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ ntɛm.
Do whatever you want.	Yɛ nea wopɛ biara.
The journey took two hours.	Ɔkwan no gyee nnɔnhwerew abien.
Who else feels that way?.	Hena bio na ɔte nka saa?.
If you can keep up, well and good.	Sɛ wubetumi akɔ so a, yiye na eye.
If you want to be good, you can.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ papa a, wubetumi.
They will really enjoy it!.	Wɔn ani begye ho ankasa!.
No doubt he hoped so.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
In the past, it was quite simple.	Bere bi a atwam no, na ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
He used it.	Ɔde dii dwuma.
The house is very nice.	Ofie no yɛ fɛ yiye.
There was no one else.	Ná obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
And I wasn’t the only one.	Na ɛnyɛ me nkutoo.
Great phone for the price.	Telefon kɛse ma bo no.
It’s an interesting concept.	Ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ anigye.
It was a test.	Ná ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ.
That is animal, human nature.	Ɛno ne aboa, onipa su.
And that would cause a much bigger problem.	Na ɛno de ɔhaw kɛse koraa bɛba.
I’ll be happy with it.	M’ani begye ho.
The quality was great overall.	Ná su pa no yɛ kɛse wɔ ne nyinaa mu.
Life comes from water.	Nsu mu na nkwa fi ba.
But as things stand now.	Nanso sɛnea nneɛma te mprempren no.
Best of all, he’s one of our people.	Nea eye sen biara ne sɛ, ɔyɛ yɛn nkurɔfo no mu biako.
The result is that.	Nea afi mu aba ne sɛ.
There was no doubt about it.	Ná akyinnye biara nni ho.
But there is nothing we can do.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ.
Not like he was last night.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea na ɔte anadwo a etwaam no.
But it is a system.	Nanso ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe.
The scale of the project surprised us.	Sɛnea adwuma no kɛse te no maa yɛn ho dwiriw yɛn.
But that’s kind of it.	Nanso ɛno ne ɔkwan bi so.
You’re terrible.	Wo ho yɛ hu.
I had to make a home for myself.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ofie ma me ho.
Something seems to have taken over.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribi agye kwan.
That’s why it’s hard for us.	Ɛno nti na ɛyɛ den ma yɛn no.
That was the way it was.	Saa na na ɛte.
These days are unclear.	Nna yi mu nna hɔ.
I wanted to be that guy.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa ɔbarima no.
Or maybe it’s not.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
Tell me, you will be fine.	Ka kyerɛ me, wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
It’s very easy for them.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye ma wɔn.
They just use a different method.	Wɔde ɔkwan foforo di dwuma ara kwa.
I have your son.	Mewɔ wo ba no.
That is not true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware.
If you want, I can do it.	Sɛ wopɛ a, metumi ayɛ.
There is no need to do so.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
So, not like me at all.	Enti, ɛnyɛ sɛ me koraa.
It’s not as simple as you said.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea wokae no.
I wish it was more difficult.	Me yam a anka ɛyɛ den kɛse.
There are many reasons for this, and this is a big deal.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa, na eyi yɛ ade kɛse.
He wanted to go in with them.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne wɔn kɔ mu.
Many had done so.	Ná pii ayɛ saa.
No one is more famous on the field this week.	Obiara nni hɔ a agye din sen saa wɔ abɔnten so dapɛn yi.
Maybe I will, too.	Ebia me nso.
But you may be right.	Nanso ebia woayɛ no yiye.
The test was very difficult.	Ná sɔhwɛ no mu yɛ den yiye.
Where could he go?	Ɛhe na na obetumi akɔ?
We'll work it into the week.	Yɛbɛyɛ ho adwuma akɔ dapɛn no mu.
He is my son.	Ɔyɛ me ba.
This has helped me a lot.	Saa ade yi aboa me kɛse.
The city was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ kurow no mu ma.
She’s attracted to another man.	N’ani gye ɔbarima foforo ho.
I had to find out who did it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu onii a ɔyɛɛ saa.
But that is not the end.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne awiei.
And that’s the point.	Na ɛno ne asɛm no.
But no one else seemed to know.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea obi foforo biara nnim.
He didn’t know anything.	Ná onnim hwee.
That’s when I knew.	Saa bere no na minim.
I don’t know what it’s for.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ ma.
A similar story applies here.	Asɛm a ɛte saa ara fa ho wɔ ha.
That will be in each of us.	Ɛno bɛyɛ yɛn mu biara mu.
Everyone thought it was very good.	Obiara susuwii sɛ eye paa.
Entire.	Ne nyinaa.
One is obviously time.	Ɛda adi sɛ biako ne bere.
My car is okay.	Me kar no nyɛ hwee.
I heard about it this morning.	Metee ho asɛm anɔpa yi.
And you.	Ne wo.
Too much time has passed.	Bere pii a atwam dodo.
And not now.	Na ɛnyɛ mprempren.
This takes time to establish.	Eyi gye bere ansa na wɔde asi hɔ.
I’d appreciate any help.	M’ani begye mmoa biara ho.
Be careful or your feet will get wet.	Hwɛ yiye anyɛ saa a wo nan bɛyɛ nsu.
The table was set for two.	Wɔde pon no sii hɔ maa nnipa baanu.
Start again here.	Fi ase bio wɔ ha.
He knew that now.	Ná onim saa mprempren.
Nothing in it and nothing in it.	Biribiara nni mu na biribiara nni mu.
More on that below.	Ɛno ho nsɛm pii wɔ ase ha.
I immediately took it upon myself.	Mede me ho too so ntɛm ara.
Same situation, but with a car.	Tebea koro no ara, nanso ɔwɔ kar.
We need to do this now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ eyi mprempren.
It’s not that bad.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne saa.
So there had to be somewhere else.	Enti na ɛsɛ sɛ baabi foforo wɔ hɔ.
I find this to be very true.	Mihu sɛ eyi yɛ nokware paa.
To do so much with so little is amazing.	Sɛ́ wɔde nneɛma kakraa bi na ɛyɛ pii saa no yɛ nwonwa.
So they’re a very, very good, solid team.	Enti wɔyɛ kuw a eye paa, paa, a ɛyɛ den.
It hurts me.	Ɛyɛ me yaw.
This is nothing.	Eyi nyɛ hwee.
The prospects are solid.	Anidaso no yɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
Some things are expensive.	Nneɛma bi bo yɛ den.
It was an amazing thing to be a part of.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ wobɛyɛ ne fã.
The packaging had been going on for days.	Ná nneɛma a wɔde ahyɛ mu no akɔ so nna pii.
Stay on the highway.	Tra ɔkwan kɛse no so.
Even credit cards.	Nneɛma a wɔde gye sika mpo.
We are not that strong.	Yɛn ho nyɛ den saa.
The money on the table.	Sika a ɛwɔ pon no so.
I know and admire his father.	Minim ne papa na m’ani gye ho.
And maybe that was true.	Na ebia na ɛno yɛ nokware.
So he wanted it bad.	Enti na ɔpɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne.
He is a self-portrait.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔbɔ ne ho mfonini.
I'm done with that.	Me deɛ, me deɛ meyɛ wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
It was brought to the forefront.	Wɔde baa nea edi kan no so.
It’s been hard.	Ayɛ den.
It follows that .	Ɛno na edi akyi sɛ .
So, a point the two are going to make or.	Enti, asɛm bi a wɔn baanu no de rekɔ anaa.
I didn’t have a team.	Ná minni kuw biara.
So they say.	Enti wɔka.
And he wasn’t.	Na ɔno nso.
I thought it was pretty good.	Misusuwii sɛ eye yiye.
That is the situation.	Ɛno ne tebea no.
Or the music.	Anaasɛ nnwom no.
Do less and do less.	Yɛ kakraa bi na yɛ kakraa bi.
There used to be cars that looked like cars too.	Kan no na kar ahorow wɔ hɔ a ɛte sɛ kar nso.
It’s time for a new project.	Ɛyɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma foforo.
The thought was painful.	Adwene no yɛɛ yaw.
Everyone understands the same thing.	Obiara te ade koro ase.
This is just our time.	Eyi yɛ yɛn bere ara kwa.
Talk about what’s scary.	Ka nea ɛyɛ hu ho asɛm.
I love my hair.	M’ani gye me ti nhwi ho.
Water is essential for life.	Nsu ho hia ma nkwa.
If they like them, you will too.	Sɛ wɔn ani gye wɔn ho a, wo nso w’ani begye ho.
That was difficult.	Ná ɛno yɛ den.
Like most animals, humans find hibernation inconvenient.	Te sɛ mmoa dodow no ara no, nnipa hu sɛ awɔw bere mu nna nyɛ mmerɛw.
Last but not least is his mother.	Nea etwa to ne ne maame.
But it was too late.	Nanso na aka akyi dodo.
I want to see the game continue.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛ agoru no kɔ so.
I'm too busy to be with you today.	Me nni adagyew dodo sɛ mɛka wo ho nnɛ.
He says he has a wonderful mind.	Ɔka sɛ ɔwɔ adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He had to eat a lot.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ odi pii.
Seems like a good idea to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwene pa ma me.
The water is hot.	Nsu no yɛ hyew.
Jobs were scarce in these sectors.	Ná nnwuma ho yɛ na wɔ saa nnwuma ahorow yi mu.
This is a very important factor.	Eyi yɛ ade a ɛho hia kɛse.
He was the talk of the town.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a wɔka ne ho asɛm wɔ kurow no mu.
This brings us to the present.	Eyi de yɛn ba mprempren.
She is a real person who is beautiful inside and out.	Ɔyɛ onipa ankasa a ne ho yɛ fɛ wɔ ne mu ne akyi.
And enjoy yourself.	Na gye w’ani.
Very accurate.	Nea edi mu yiye.
You know that now.	Wunim saa mprempren.
He was a completely different man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima foforo koraa.
Anyone else has any ideas.	Obi foforo biara wɔ adwene biara.
There was no winner.	Ná obiara nni hɔ a odi nkonim.
Besides, it was too late.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, na aka akyi dodo.
And that’s the end of that.	Na ɛno ne ɛno awiei.
Almost here, sorry.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ha, kyɛw.
I don’t think it would be that difficult.	Minsusuw sɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ den saa.
Take a quote.	Fa asɛm bi fa.
He really loved this job.	Ná ɔpɛ adwuma yi ankasa.
I don't know what to think.	Minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
It was a very good book.	Ná ɛyɛ nhoma a eye paa.
Everything was going well.	Ná biribiara rekɔ so yiye.
I don’t have time for anyone.	Minni bere mma obiara.
It’s not the ground.	Ɛnyɛ fam.
Such a wonderful child.	Abofra a ɔyɛ nwonwa a ɔte saa.
He wasn’t wrong.	Ná ɔnyɛ mfomso.
They recovered or completely recovered.	Wɔn ho tɔɔ wɔn anaasɛ wɔn ho tɔɔ wɔn koraa.
He did his kicking.	Ɔyɛɛ ne nan a ɔde bɔɔ ne nan so.
Everyone was full of it.	Ná obiara ahyɛ ne ma.
You can get a new one.	Wubetumi anya foforo.
So are people, too.	Saa ara na nnipa nso.
So be careful.	Enti hwɛ yiye.
However, you need to think carefully about whether it is for you.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho yiye sɛ ɛyɛ ma wo anaa.
Do this now!	Yɛ eyi mprempren!
I can’t go out like that.	Mintumi mfi adi saa.
The car drives very fast.	Kar no ka ntɛmntɛm yiye.
We gave them everything.	Yɛde biribiara maa wɔn.
I believe we should have done that.	Migye di sɛ anka ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
He looked so young.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
He slipped his hand into hers.	Ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ ne de no mu.
This road is dangerous at night.	Saa kwan yi yɛ hu anadwo.
Put things first.	Fa nneɛma di kan.
Give them this opportunity.	Ma wɔn saa hokwan yi.
We have each other.	Yɛwɔ yɛn ho yɛn ho.
Things are moving much faster.	Nneɛma rekɔ so ntɛmntɛm kɛse.
There is a mistake.	Mfomso bi wɔ hɔ.
I look much younger than my actual age.	Mehwɛ sɛ meyɛ abofra koraa sen me mfe ankasa.
And it wasn’t my idea.	Na ɛnyɛ m’adwene.
I do, sorry.	Meyɛ saa, paa kyɛw.
It was absolutely amazing to be here.	Na ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa sɛ mewɔ ha.
You are wonderful with children.	Woyɛ nwonwa wɔ mmofra ho.
There had to be more to the story.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma pii ka asɛm no ho.
He was a man to take risks.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho to asiane mu.
The kids were excited outside the room.	Ná mmofra no ani agye wɔ dan no akyi.
Nothing had to be about money.	Na ɛnyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ biribiara fa sika ho.
And that may still be the case.	Na ebia ɛno da so ara te saa.
In any case, he didn't have much to say.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na onni asɛm pii.
Do you see the hair?	So wuhu nhwi no?
I love both outfits.	M’ani gye ntade abien no nyinaa ho.
That is being efficient.	Ɛno ne sɛ wobɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
If that is true.	Sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware a.
He loves the game.	N’ani gye agoru no ho.
I can’t really figure out how to do this.	Me ntumi nhu sɛnea mɛyɛ eyi ankasa.
Get out of the house.	Fi fie hɔ.
The road has come to our door.	Ɔkwan no aba yɛn pon ano.
Everything is perfect.	Biribiara yɛ pɛ.
But it’s something we spend a lot of time doing.	Nanso ɛyɛ biribi a yɛde bere pii yɛ.
That will surely make the people happy.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno bɛma nnipa no ani agye.
This is no game.	Eyi nyɛ agoru biara.
No major problems.	Ɔhaw kɛse biara nni hɔ.
I see more in this than you do.	Mihu pii wɔ eyi mu sen wo.
There is now one.	Mprempren biako wɔ hɔ.
My car is parked.	Me kar no asi hɔ.
Think of it this way.	Susuw ho wɔ saa kwan yi so.
That’s all old hat to me.	Ɛno nyinaa yɛ kyɛw dedaw ma me.
None of them work.	Wɔn mu biara nyɛ adwuma.
Take home the great idea.	Fa adwene kɛse no kɔ fie.
There was no chance to go anywhere else.	Na hokwan biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛkɔ baabi foforo biara.
But the truth must live on.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ nokware no tra ase.
This seems to make it work.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi ma ɛyɛ yiye.
I didn’t like that at all.	Ná m’ani nnye saa asɛm no ho koraa.
What he might have done.	Nea ebia na ɔbɛyɛ.
But there was nothing you could do.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
I insert the paper.	Mede krataa no hyɛ mu.
No one knew how powerful he was now.	Ná obiara nnim sɛnea na ɔwɔ tumi mprempren.
It's very very good.	Eye paa paa.
Take your time, do it the right way the first time.	Gye wo bere, yɛ no ɔkwan pa so bere a edi kan no.
It’s not my father.	Ɛnyɛ me papa.
It’s good to include it.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ yɛde bɛka ho.
I have some new ideas for the dress!	Mewɔ adwene foforo bi wɔ atade no ho!
It looks surprisingly good.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There are many of them.	Wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
That you are not a good person.	Sɛ wonyɛ onipa pa.
Everyone had the same rights .	Obiara nyaa hokwan koro no ara .
It shouldn’t work in my opinion.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ m’adwene mu.
He wanted to be somewhere else.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔwɔ baabi foforo.
Everything inside me, everything outside me.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ me mu, biribiara a ɛwɔ me akyi.
It was my father’s mother’s name.	Ná ɛyɛ me papa maame din.
There is a new order starting with the first one.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a nhyehyɛe foforo bi fi ase wɔ nea edi kan no so.
Or use his picture.	Anaasɛ fa ne mfonini no di dwuma.
I can’t believe that.	Me ntumi nnye nni saa.
Content is for personal use only.	Nsɛm a ɛwɔ mu no yɛ nea wɔde bedi dwuma ankasa nkutoo.
It’s a very, very good book.	Ɛyɛ nhoma a eye paa paa.
This is it now.	Eyi ne no mprempren.
It should have been a fun night.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anadwo a ɛyɛ anigye.
Dinner will be included.	Wɔde anwummere aduan bɛka ho.
I can see it.	Metumi ahu.
I want them done in the meantime.	Mepɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa bere yi mu.
At least this one did.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, eyi yɛɛ saa.
He nodded at me.	Ɔde ne ti too fam kyerɛɛ me.
Can you give me some more money?	So wubetumi ama me sika bi bio?
Everyone feels it.	Obiara te nka.
You want to understand everything with your head.	Wopɛ sɛ wode wo ti te biribiara ase.
I heard a lot of good things about it.	Metee nsɛm pa pii faa ho.
If they did, we wouldn’t be able to continue working.	Sɛ wɔyɛ saa a, anka yɛrentumi nkɔ so nyɛ adwuma.
He must have known too.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɔno nso nim.
He was interested in it.	Ná n’ani gye ho.
He would be a nice guy.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
That’s my new bike.	Ɛno ne me sakre foforo no.
Not recently.	Ɛnyɛ nnansa yi.
Who is the first on it?	Hena na odi kan wɔ so?
You really come up with wonderful points.	Wode nsɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa ba ankasa.
We can only see the images his mind suggests.	Mfonini ahorow a n’adwene kyerɛ no nkutoo na yebetumi ahu.
Whatever he used to be.	Nea na ɔyɛ kan biara no.
For the sake of our children, we must.	Yɛn mma nti, ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
The food blew my mind.	Aduan no bɔɔ m’adwene.
There are probably two reasons for this.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ nneɛma abien nti na wɔyɛ eyi.
Their skilled hands can be wet or dry.	Wɔn nsa a wɔn ho akokwaw no tumi yɛ nsu anaa nsu.
This room is absolutely clear.	Saa dan yi mu da hɔ koraa.
It was and always has been.	Na ɛwɔ hɔ na ɛwɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
However, I think this is a bit too fast.	Nanso, misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo kakra.
But that’s just the street.	Nanso ɛno yɛ abɔnten so ara kwa.
We thoroughly enjoyed the evening.	Yɛn ani gyee anwummere no ho kɛse.
No one can do anything.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ biribiara.
The house was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ fie hɔ ma.
The more people talking about it, the better.	Dodow a nnipa pii ka ho asɛm no, dodow no ara na eye.
Finally, the child walked inside.	Awiei koraa no, abofra no nantew baa mu.
It’s just a great house.	Ɛyɛ ofie kɛse bi kɛkɛ.
I need to understand two things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete nneɛma abien ase.
So it’s very simple.	Enti ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
He is not the one to surrender.	Ɛnyɛ ɔno na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho ma.
We have the morning walk.	Yɛwɔ anɔpa nantew no.
The last time.	Bere a etwa to no.
I think they were the only ones involved.	Misusuw sɛ na wɔn nkutoo na wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ mu.
Not one of them knew what to do.	Ná wɔn mu biako mpo nnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I saw this the other day.	Mihuu eyi da bi a atwam no.
Something is there now.	Biribi wɔ hɔ mprempren.
This seems really strange.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
No idea is too scary.	Adwene biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ hu dodo.
Maybe it’s a good thing.	Ebia ɛyɛ ade pa.
Create the system.	Bɔ nhyehyɛe no.
I took him home and gave him my bed.	Mede no kɔɔ fie na mede me mpa maa no.
I do nothing for nothing but books and walking.	Menyɛ hwee mma hwee gye nhoma ne nantew.
That was nothing.	Ná ɛno nyɛ hwee.
Some things are just too expensive.	Nneɛma bi bo yɛ den dodo ara kwa.
I keep singing.	Mekɔ so to dwom.
We can talk about it later.	Yebetumi aka ho asɛm akyiri yi.
We can agree on one thing.	Yebetumi ayɛ adwene wɔ ade biako ho.
He didn't seem normal.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔnyɛ obi a ɔte ase.
So, that’s a big risk.	Enti, ɛno yɛ asiane kɛse.
It had to do two more things.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nneɛma abien foforo.
It has a story.	Ɛwɔ asɛm.
He sits on the ground.	Ɔte fam.
This was a shock to us.	Eyi maa yɛn ho dwiriw yɛn paa.
This car is more expensive than the last one.	Saa kar yi bo yɛ den sen nea etwa to no.
You’re worried about yourself.	Wo ho asɛm haw wo.
This was a great opportunity.	Ná eyi yɛ hokwan kɛse.
In a way, it’s beautiful.	Ɔkwan bi so no, ɛyɛ fɛ.
And you are lucky to be alive.	Na wowɔ anigye sɛ wowɔ nkwa mu.
The test starts out fairly easy but gets much harder at the end.	Sɔhwɛ no fi ase mmerɛw koraa nanso ɛyɛ den kɛse wɔ awiei no.
And you think about it.	Na wususuw ho.
I don’t really want to.	Mempɛ ankasa.
You can do that.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa.
Good job on that.	Adwuma pa wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
That’s about it though.	Ɛno fa ho nanso.
It is a human nature.	Ɛyɛ onipa su.
That was important to know.	Ná ɛno ho hia sɛ wuhu.
I'm just weak.	Meyɛ mmerɛw ara kwa.
There is so much to do!	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ!
That day never came.	Saa da no amma da.
You know, a lot of people overlooked that.	Wunim, nnipa pii ani fii saa asɛm no so.
Her pain was gone.	Ná ne yaw no afi hɔ.
They have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Which is really nice too, for a moment.	Nea ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa nso, bere tiaa bi.
The story is nothing.	Asɛm no nyɛ hwee.
Not fast enough.	Ɛnyɛ ntɛmntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
However, it was only one time.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ bere biako pɛ.
Tonight had been a lot of fun.	Ná anadwo yi ayɛ anigye kɛse.
Maybe my picture will be in the paper.	Ebia me mfonini no bɛba krataa no mu.
I’ve always loved this song.	M’ani gye dwom yi ho bere nyinaa.
It was a pleasure to work with him over the years.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye sɛ me ne no bɛyɛ adwuma wɔ mfe no mu.
But that is not realistic.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
He thought about the door.	Osusuw ɔpon no ho.
But it’s not me doing that.	Nanso ɛnyɛ me yɛ saa.
I wanted to know how you were doing.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea wo ho te.
So was everyone else.	Saa ara na na obiara nso te.
It has been pretty easy so far.	Ayɛ ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye de besi nnɛ.
Look where you have brought us.	Hwɛ baabi a wode yɛn aba.
This test is very difficult.	Saa sɔhwɛ yi yɛ den yiye.
The matter is very disturbing.	Asɛm no haw no paa.
I knew how much you wanted something like that.	Ná minim sɛnea wopɛ biribi a ɛte saa kɛse.
The police opened fire.	Polisifo no too tuo.
Whatever my team needs me to do.	Biribiara a me kuw no hia sɛ meyɛ.
I love making music.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ nnwom.
You have the power now.	Wo na wowɔ tumi no mprempren.
What shouldn’t you do?	Dɛn na ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ?
It’s a thrill	Ɛyɛ anigye
We remember him fondly.	Yɛde anigye kae no.
Or what happened later.	Anaasɛ nea esii akyiri yi.
In a bad way.	Wɔ ɔkwan bɔne so.
But things never go according to plan.	Nanso nneɛma nkɔ sɛnea nhyehyɛe te da.
None of them did that again.	Wɔn mu biara anyɛ saa bio.
It’s not my business.	Ɛnyɛ me asɛm.
This really sucks.	Eyi su ankasa.
No one was home.	Ná obiara nni fie.
I think it’s a good thing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ ade pa.
There is no shortage of things in the city.	Nneɛma ho nhia wɔ kurow no mu.
I don’t want to do this every time.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi bere biara.
A house party, if you will.	Ofie apontow, sɛ wopɛ a.
This can be a problem.	Eyi betumi ayɛ ɔhaw.
Not his mother.	Ɛnyɛ ne maame.
I would really appreciate any help.	Anka m’ani begye mmoa biara ho ankasa.
It was only in his.	Ná ɛwɔ ne de no mu nkutoo.
It’s not a new thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade foforo.
I don't have much longer.	Minni bere tenten pii bio.
Who was the greatest innovator?	Hena ne obi a ɔyɛɛ nneɛma foforo sen biara?
If we are happy, he will help us.	Sɛ yɛn ani gye a, ɔbɛboa yɛn.
His condition was non-existent.	Ná ne tebea no nni hɔ.
This time, you are a much better person.	Saa bere yi de, wo ne obi a ɔyɛ papa sen saa koraa.
It was absolutely terrifying for them.	Ná ɛyɛ hu koraa ma wɔn.
My mother also knew that one day this would happen.	Ná me maame nso nim sɛ da bi eyi bɛba.
Simple, fast, and easy to use.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw, ɛyɛ ntɛm, na ɛnyɛ den sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
And this happens whether you like it or not.	Na eyi ba sɛ w’ani gye ho anaasɛ wompɛ.
We are never as beautiful as we were then.	Yɛn ho nyɛ fɛ te sɛ nea na yɛyɛ saa bere no da.
We enjoyed our meal immensely.	Yɛn ani gyee yɛn aduan no ho kɛse.
That is not true!	Ɛno nyɛ nokware!
Don’t be too uptight, though.	Nanso, mma wo ho nyɛ wo yaw dodo.
And where it should be.	Na baabi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
Two years had passed since that night.	Ná mfe abien atwam fi saa anadwo no.
We all have to sleep in bed.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa da mpa so.
It’s possible.	Ɛyɛ yiye.
However, do something with it and it will be really powerful.	Nanso, fa yɛ biribi na ɛbɛyɛ nea tumi wom ankasa.
But know this.	Nanso hu eyi.
Maybe it didn’t matter.	Ebia na ɛnyɛ hwee.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni ho.
Everyone could have had that in their home.	Anka obiara betumi anya saa wɔ ne fie.
That went on for quite some time.	Ɛno kɔɔ so bere tenten bi.
We had a lot of wonderful plans.	Ná yɛwɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow a ɛyɛ nwonwa pii.
Get out of it.	Fi mu.
That would be a lie, too.	Ɛno nso bɛyɛ atoro.
So think about it, and do it.	Enti susuw ho, na yɛ.
I’m happy and excited about it.	M’ani agye na m’ani agye wɔ ho.
I was getting bigger.	Ná mereyɛ kɛse.
I think that was a big mistake on my part.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno yɛ mfomso kɛse wɔ me fam.
I put it on the bed.	Mede too mpa no so.
He knows it, too.	Ɔno nso nim.
I just wanted to know where he was.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu baabi a ɔwɔ ara kwa.
I accept all of me now.	Migye me nyinaa tom mprempren.
I have played some games with them.	Me ne wɔn adi agoru bi.
He is always absolutely truthful.	Ɔka nokware koraa bere nyinaa.

I had to bring him home several times.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede no ba fie mpɛn pii.

Not a bad idea at all.	Ɛnyɛ adwene bɔne koraa.
I’m not feeling well.	Me ho nyɛ me den.
It’s really beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
For each pair, add one to the other.	Wɔ baanu biara ho no, fa biako ka biako ho.
Even you have that.	Wo mpo na wowɔ saa.
I loved my music, man.	Ná m’ani gye me nnwom ho, ɔbarima.
The story plays out for them.	Asɛm no di agoru ma wɔn.
I never forget a face.	Me werɛ mfi anim bi da.
And he was a good planner.	Na na ɔyɛ nhyehyɛe pa.
You’ll do the same.	Wo nso wobɛyɛ saa.
I didn’t want to go on anymore.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mekɔ so bio.
I absolutely loved the movie.	M’ani gyee sini no ho koraa.
I can’t see it.	Mintumi nhu.
It never feels the same.	Ɛnte sɛ nea ɛte no ara da.
Did something happen?	So biribi sii?
I told your father.	Meka kyerɛɛ wo papa.
I wonder if this bill is fake.	Misusuw sɛ ebia saa sika yi yɛ atoro anaa.
There is nothing else.	Ade foforo biara nni hɔ.
It was a one-stop shop.	Ná ɛyɛ ade biako a wɔyɛ.
I can’t do anything.	Me ntumi nyɛ hwee.
And that’s what’s so interesting.	Na ɛno ne nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
I can’t make it better.	Mintumi mma ɛnyɛ papa.
I just want to give you the whole picture.	Mepɛ sɛ mede mfonini no nyinaa ma wo kɛkɛ.
He obviously had no intention of telling me the truth.	Ɛda adi sɛ na onni adwene biara sɛ ɔbɛka nokware no akyerɛ me.
Hear in the window.	Te wɔ mfɛnsere mu.
The strange man walked home.	Ɔbarima a ɔyɛ nwonwa no nantew kɔɔ fie.
That’s my problem.	Ɛno ne me haw.
I know these people.	Minim saa nkurɔfo yi.
Why you have to tell me most of what they tell me.	Nea enti a ɛsɛ sɛ woka nea wɔka kyerɛ me no dodow no ara.
I am surprised to know how long it has been delayed inside.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa sɛ minim bere tenten a wɔde akyɛ wɔ mu no.
This was not on me at all.	Ná eyi nni me so koraa.
Someone would come.	Ná obi bɛba.
But he wanted more.	Nanso na ɔpɛ pii.
Alright! 	Ɛyɛ!
the same is true of us.	saa ara na yɛbɛyɛ.
There is another girl.	Abeawa foforo bi nso wɔ hɔ.
Someone who looks like him.	Obi a ɔte sɛ ɔno.
And you, too.	Na wo nso.
It was quite a situation.	Ná ɛyɛ tebea bi ankasa.
I can’t help myself.	Mintumi mmoa me ho.
I didn’t think anything of it at the time.	Saa bere no na minsusuw ho hwee.
However, it doesn’t work.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I usually don’t care about the rest.	Mpɛn pii no, nea aka no mfa me ho.
A really awesome party, everyone enjoyed it.	Apontow a ɛyɛ hu ankasa, obiara ani gyee ho.
He slipped into her.	Ɔde ne ho too ne so.
This has often been difficult.	Mpɛn pii no, eyi ayɛ den.
This is certainly true for humans.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ nokware ma nnipa.
We really enjoyed our stay.	Yɛn ani gyee yɛn tra no ho ankasa.
The accident happened a week ago.	Akwanhyia no sii dapɛn biako a atwam ni.
It’s pretty scary.	Ɛyɛ hu yiye.
The person here is the person now.	Onipa a ɔwɔ ha no ne onipa a ɔte hɔ seesei.
And something went wrong with it.	Na biribi anyɛ yiye wɔ ho.
However, this is nothing new.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ ade foforo.
Keep up the great work!.	Kɔ so yɛ adwuma kɛse no!.
As it once was.	Sɛnea na ɛte bere bi no.
We had to get through it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde fa mu.
This cannot continue.	Eyi ntumi nkɔ so.
It’s a really big deal.	Ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse ankasa.
You know this.	Wunim eyi.
Maybe it’s a good thing.	Ebia ɛyɛ ade pa.
Everyone has that.	Obiara wɔ saa.
You are not a nobody.	Wonyɛ obi a ɔnyɛ obiara.
But it’s not the same thing.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ade koro.
This was not one.	Ná eyi nyɛ biako.
You need to consider the types of jobs available here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw nnwuma ahorow a ɛwɔ ha no ho.
However, they are interdependent.	Nanso, wɔde wɔn ho to wɔn ho wɔn ho so.
Stay on top of it.	Tra so wɔ so.
He obviously doesn’t.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
I think both shouldn't be involved.	Misusuw sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa de wɔn ho hyɛ mu.
At least it seems that way.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
This is the interesting point for us.	Eyi ne asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye ma yɛn.
His mother was not human.	Ná ne maame nyɛ onipa.
As none of us really know.	Sɛnea yɛn mu biara nnim ankasa no.
It has to be you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo.
They both wanted something, which was at least once money.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa pɛ biribi, a anyɛ yiye koraa no na ɛyɛ sika bere bi.
He gives her everything she wants.	Ɔde biribiara a ɔpɛ ma no.
This was placed very close to him.	Wɔde eyi sii hɔ bɛn no yiye.
It just doesn’t work.	Kɛkɛ a ɛnyɛ adwuma.
When she was painting, she looked gorgeous.	Bere a ɔreyɛ mfonini no, na ɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
There was plenty of room.	Ná baabi pii wɔ hɔ.
She was home alone, so it was no problem.	Ná ɔno nkutoo wɔ fie, enti na ɛnyɛ ɔhaw biara.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na ɛte saa.
But the system has some drawbacks.	Nanso nhyehyɛe no wɔ ɔhaw ahorow bi.
That’s one thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade biako.
There was nothing else he could do here.	Biribiara nni hɔ bio a na obetumi ayɛ wɔ ha.
It is a group of animals.	Ɛyɛ mmoa kuw bi.
Very interesting situation.	Tebea a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
This whole thing is my idea.	Saa ade yi nyinaa ne m’adwene.
I really want to see him.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu no ankasa.
That doesn’t surprise me.	Ɛno nyɛ me nwonwa.
You can go faster.	Wubetumi akɔ ntɛmntɛm.
That used to be a huge number.	Kan no na ɛno yɛ dodow kɛse.
Imagine you are a boy.	Fa no sɛ woyɛ abarimaa.
You don’t have to think about it.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wususuw ho.
However, the story was good.	Nanso, na asɛm no yɛ papa.
A complete approach is also possible.	Ɔkwan a edi mũ nso betumi ayɛ yiye.
Blame.	Fa hyɛ.
It was a very nice part of town.	Ná ɛyɛ kurow no fã a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
This is important in many applications.	Eyi ho hia wɔ nneɛma pii a wɔde di dwuma mu.
I did a bit of both.	Meyɛɛ abien no nyinaa kakra.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani gye ho paa.
I didn’t know what to say right away.	Ná minnim nea mɛka ntɛm ara.
You have another opportunity here.	Wowɔ hokwan foforo wɔ ha.
Talk them through.	Ka wɔn ho asɛm fa mu.
But anything you can tell me can help me.	Nanso biribiara a wubetumi aka akyerɛ me no betumi aboa me.
Otherwise, it’s a bad book.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ saa a, ɛyɛ nhoma bɔne.
Their plan was amazing.	Ná wɔn nhyehyɛe no yɛ nwonwa.
He was there on the night of the incident.	Na ɔwɔ hɔ anadwo a asɛm no sii no.
That is a very important point.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm a ɛho hia paa.
But there is one thing everyone needs to know.	Nanso ade biako wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ obiara hu.
But it always surprises me at the end.	Nanso bere nyinaa ma me ho dwiriw me wɔ awiei no.
Be easy to work with.	Yɛ mmerɛw sɛ wo ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
But so what.	Nanso enti dɛn.
That doesn’t matter.	Ɛno ho nhia.
Look at things from a whole new perspective.	Hwɛ nneɛma wɔ ɔkwan foforo koraa so.
I don't really care what they do.	Nea wɔyɛ no mfa me ho ankasa.
The police were able to make arrangements.	Polisifo no tumi yɛɛ nhyehyɛe.
And you have it.	Na wowɔ.
Just count them.	Kan wɔn kɛkɛ.
But that is not true.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ nokware.
At least we can agree on that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yebetumi ayɛ adwene wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Something, moving towards him.	Biribi, a ɛrekɔ ne nkyɛn.
There is no tomorrow here.	Ɔkyena biara nni ha.
As such we provide some practical information.	Sɛnea ɛte no yɛde nsɛm bi a yɛde bedi dwuma ma.
There was one other person in the room.	Ná onipa foforo biako nso wɔ dan no mu.
I really liked the person.	M’ani gyee onipa no ho ankasa.
These things continue to this day.	Saa nneɛma yi kɔ so de besi nnɛ.
Told you that.	Ka kyerɛɛ wo saa.
It will be quite simple.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
I’m glad your opinion backfired.	M’ani agye sɛ wo adwene no san kɔɔ akyi.
He should have had trouble sleeping.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔhaw wɔ nna mu.
I knew it was him.	Ná minim sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno.
He was at one with everything, absolutely.	Ná ɔne biribiara yɛ biako, koraa.
But my legs hurt.	Nanso na me nan yɛ me yaw.
First of all, the duration.	Nea edi kan koraa no, bere tenten no.
It’s not good at all.	Ɛnyɛ papa koraa.
Get in his way and he will touch your head.	Fa wo ho hyɛ ne kwan mu na ɔbɛka wo ti.
Something was going on.	Ná biribi rekɔ so.
I'm about to leave.	Mereyɛ akɔ.
You hope that it is.	Wowɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
No one else was here.	Ná obi foforo biara nni ha.
It’s not my style.	Ɛnyɛ me su.
Not many friends.	Ɛnyɛ nnamfo pii.
What needed to be done was very clear.	Ná nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no mu da hɔ yiye.
All this stuff.	Saa ade yi nyinaa.
He could have had anything he wanted to eat.	Anka obetumi anya biribiara a ɔpɛ sɛ odi.
The time had passed.	Ná bere no atwam.
And you've been wrong for a while.	Na woayɛ no bɔne bere tiaa bi.
The dog, however, was never a dog.	Nanso, na ɔkraman no nyɛ ɔkraman da.
He too tried to go to work.	Ɔno nso bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛkɔ adwuma.
He put it down.	Ɔde too fam.
Do a good job.	Yɛ adwuma pa.
He didn't know where it was.	Ná onnim baabi a ɛwɔ.
You can see the results in the first picture.	Wubetumi ahu nea afi mu aba wɔ mfonini a edi kan no mu.
I am sure most of us understand this.	Migye di sɛ yɛn mu dodow no ara te eyi ase.
There is too much here.	Ɛdɔɔso dodo wɔ ha.
On my head.	Wɔ me ti so.
Years of hope.	Mfe pii anidaso.
And it’s what you want too.	Na ɛyɛ nea wo nso wopɛ.
Be careful if you are new to it.	Hwɛ yiye sɛ woyɛ foforo wɔ ho a.
Go on, right now.	Kɔ so, mprempren ara.
Get in, and get out.	Kɔ mu, na fi adi.
But that’s another story.	Nanso ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo.
You are with him.	Wo ne no wɔ hɔ.
Do your best to keep them interested.	Yɛ nea wubetumi biara ma wɔn ani gye ho.
My kids felt it.	Me mma no tee nka.
Maybe it would have been.	Ebia anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
It shouldn’t be here.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ ha.
Be careful now.	Hwɛ yiye mprempren.
So it doesn’t matter.	Enti ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia.
Just for the sake of saying it.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wobɛka no ara kwa.
I'm sorry for you.	Mepa wo kyɛw.
But this has nothing to do with anything.	Nanso eyi ne biribiara nni hwee yɛ.
He had never had one before.	Ná onni bi da.
I'm good.	Me ho yɛ.
Do what you do best.	Yɛ nea woyɛ no yiye sen biara.
How can this be possible.	Ɔkwan bɛn so na eyi betumi ayɛ yiye.
Take off his shoes.	Yi ne mpaboa.
Same old story.	Asɛm dedaw koro no ara.
The girl's story is true.	Abeawa no asɛm no yɛ nokware.
However, things start to hurt.	Nanso, nneɛma fi ase yɛ yaw.
I’m not sure.	M’ani nnye ho.
Do the same for each person’s name.	Yɛ saa ara wɔ obiara din ho.
And it will be quite a bit of work, too.	Na ɛbɛyɛ adwuma kakraa bi koraa, nso.
He had said so himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa aka saa.
You know you have it.	Wunim sɛ wowɔ bi.
This does not apply to that.	Eyi mfa saa asɛm no ho.
There had to be something he could do.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
It was obviously a troublemaker.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛyɛ obi a ɔhaw no.
Except for the painful ones.	Gye sɛ nea ɛyɛ yaw no nkutoo.
The desire is growing.	Ɔpɛ no reyɛ kɛse.
It wasn't that hot just a short time ago.	Ná ɛnyɛ hyew saa bere tiaa bi pɛ a atwam ni.
Your mother has a right.	Wo maame wɔ ho kwan.
You do it.	Woyɛ no.
Can you tell me the time, please?	Mesrɛ wo, wubetumi aka bere no akyerɛ me?
Anyone can look into them.	Obiara a ɔpɛ no betumi ahwɛ wɔn mu.
He didn't have much to add.	Ná onni nsɛm pii a ɔde bɛka ho.
It has all its features.	Ɛwɔ ne nneɛma nyinaa.
The task ahead was difficult.	Ná adwuma a ɛda wɔn anim no yɛ den.
He thinks this idea is a good one.	Osusuw sɛ saa adwene yi yɛ adwene pa.
Things began to move quickly.	Nneɛma fii ase kɔɔ so ntɛmntɛm.
He was the strongest of them all.	Ná ne ho yɛ den sen wɔn nyinaa.
What happened here is not entirely clear.	Nea esii wɔ ha no mu nna hɔ koraa.
That shouldn’t be the issue.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm no.
I didn’t even want to know.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu mpo.
He wants more information.	Ɔpɛ nsɛm pii.
Were you not doing it.	So na ɛnyɛ wo reyɛ.
I was doing it for them.	Ná mereyɛ ama wɔn.
My plan is pretty simple.	Me nhyehyɛe no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
He knew what.	Ná onim nea.
I'm like that's gone.	Me te sɛ nea ɛno akɔ.
You were there for a short time.	Na wowɔ hɔ bere tiaa bi.
The same is true for you.	Saa ara na ɛte ma wo.
It’s not something like that.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
I would do anything for you.	Anka mɛyɛ biribiara ama wo.
He was closely involved in both cases.	Ná ɔde ne ho ahyɛ nsɛm abien no nyinaa mu yiye.
Your children should take advantage of their rights.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo mma no de wɔn hokwan no di dwuma.
Which as you well know.	Nea sɛnea wunim yiye no.
You have always been right.	Woayɛ no yiye bere nyinaa.
He liked the way she looked.	N’ani gyee sɛnea ɔte no ho.
Money or however.	Sika anaa nanso.
It’s like a song.	Ɛte sɛ dwom bi.
I will do the rest.	Me na mɛyɛ nea aka no.
It’s not perfect but it’s not difficult.	Ɛnyɛ nea edi mũ nanso ɛnyɛ den.
I don’t know what he is.	Minnim nea ɔyɛ.
He is .	Ɔyɛ .
You’re a sinner.	Woyɛ bɔne.
I really enjoyed learning.	M’ani gyee adesua ho ankasa.
That could be any of us.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ yɛn mu biara.
He is the one who is there.	Ɔno ne obi a ɔwɔ hɔ.
This process occurs in all species.	Saa kwan yi ba wɔ mmoa ahorow no nyinaa mu.
Start with a presence.	Fi ase wɔ baabi a obi wɔ.
What you do is terrible.	Nea woyɛ no yɛ hu.
Tell us what you like about it and why.	Ka nea w’ani gye ho wɔ ho ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
I can’t lie.	Mintumi nni atoro.
I love music a lot.	M’ani gye nnwom ho kɛse.
I know it very well.	Minim yiye.
I'm just telling the truth.	Meka nokware kɛkɛ.
It’s a hands-on process.	Ɛyɛ ade a wɔde nsa yɛ.
Do it for us, you know.	Yɛ ma yɛn, wunim.
He knew a strong man could be dangerous.	Na onim sɛ ɔbarima a ɔyɛ den betumi ayɛ asiane.
Now he doesn't want to.	Seesei ɔmpɛ koraa.
Probably not, at least not at all.	Ebia ɛnyɛ saa, anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
I have no control over that.	Minni ɛno so tumi biara.
It’s easy to do.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
And it’s more complicated.	Na ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den kɛse.
I can’t imagine his cost would be that high.	Mintumi nsusuw sɛ ne ka no bɛyɛ kɛse saa.
Maybe it’s the way it should be.	Ebia ɛyɛ ɔkwan a ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
With the help of the.	Ne mmoa no.
Later, it would be more difficult.	Akyiri yi, na ɛbɛyɛ den kɛse.
The system must therefore be structurally robust.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ nhyehyɛe no yɛ nea ɛyɛ den wɔ nhyehyɛe mu.
I couldn’t leave, not now.	Na mintumi mfi hɔ, ɛnyɛ mprempren.
Within.	Wɔ mu.
So, the story is true.	Enti, asɛm no yɛ nokware.
However, things were not good.	Nanso, na nneɛma nyɛ papa.
But it has been very difficult for him.	Nanso ayɛ den ama no yiye.
The same is true of sex.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nna mu.
Everyone can do a job.	Obiara betumi ayɛ adwuma bi.
He must have wanted you to know.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɔpɛ sɛ wuhu.
I'm surprised you don't know this.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa sɛ wunnim eyi.
He shook their hands happily.	Ɔde anigye bɔɔ wɔn nsa.
He is alive now.	Ɔte ase mprempren.
She didn't want to be his mother and father.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ne maame ne ne papa.
You really want to see your hand.	Wopɛ sɛ wuhu wo nsa ankasa.
Most mornings were painful.	Ná anɔpa dodow no ara yɛ yaw.
This was all very exciting.	Ná eyi nyinaa yɛ anigye kɛse.
It’s just a work in progress.	Ɛyɛ adwuma bi a ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
The city is	Kurow no yɛ .
I love how the characters talk to each other.	M’ani gye sɛnea nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no kasa kyerɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho no ho.
It was an incredibly powerful moment for me.	Na ɛyɛ bere a tumi wom a ɛyɛ nwonwa ma me.
I don’t like either game.	M’ani nnye agoru abien no mu biara ho.
He loved to drive his car.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛka ne kar no.
It was a facelift.	Ná ɛyɛ anim a wɔde ayɛ anim.
Police in the meantime.	Polisifo wɔ saa bere no mu.
I'm getting involved.	Mede me ho hyɛ mu.
We need to make arrangements for him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nhyehyɛe ma no.
Maybe too much time, though.	Nanso, ebia bere pii dodo.
I am and I am no one else.	Meyɛ na meyɛ obi foforo biara.
It works wonderfully.	Ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
He knew it had been too easy.	Ná onim sɛ na ayɛ mmerɛw dodo.
To tell a story.	Sɛ́ wobɛka asɛm bi.
Where?' 	Ɛhe?'
You can’t make yourself easy.	Worentumi mma wo ho nyɛ mmerɛw.
My kind, or his kind.	Me su, anaa ne su.
It was cold.	Ná awɔw wom.
Perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us.	Ebia ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn nwonwa.
But hope remains.	Nanso anidaso kɔ so tra hɔ.
It was beautiful on her.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ ne so.
Even himself.	Ɔno ankasa mpo.
That we could see.	Sɛ na yebetumi ahu.
His name, his accent.	Ne din, ne kasa a ɔde kasa.
It has to be that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
There is something fake about it.	Biribi wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ atoro wɔ ho.
Nothing seems to work.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
He puts his hand on hers.	Ɔde ne nsa to ne de so.
Many people had come.	Ná nnipa pii aba.
Usually both.	Mpɛn pii no, abien no nyinaa.
That was another time, another time.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere foforo, bere foforo.
He was no longer human at all.	Ná ɔnyɛ onipa koraa bio.
It’s not really that important.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia saa ankasa.
Check out this book.	Hwɛ nhoma yi mu.
Look at what I have been given.	Hwɛ nea wɔde ama me.
And he didn’t want to do that.	Na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
It’s all fake, fake, fake.	Ne nyinaa yɛ atoro, atoro, atoro.
So do one more, one more, one more.	Enti yɛ biako bio, biako bio, biako bio.
Where do you work?	Ɛhe na woyɛ adwuma?
But they were rare.	Nanso na wɔn ho yɛ na.
I don’t even know if it was a game anymore.	Minnim mpo sɛ ebia na ɛyɛ agoru bio anaa.
And so he brings it.	Na enti ɔde ba.
It’s not easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
Maybe he didn’t know what it was.	Ebia na onnim nea ɛyɛ.
All good things are in the minds of many.	Nneɛma pa nyinaa wɔ nnipa pii adwene mu.
And so did we.	Na yɛn nso.
Or much of the past.	Anaasɛ nneɛma a atwam no fã kɛse no ara.
It will be at the same time.	Ɛbɛyɛ saa bere no ara.
Do you want it now?	So wopɛ no mprempren?
So are our children.	Saa ara na yɛn mma nso te.
And you’re a good one, too.	Na wo nso woyɛ papa.
So were the people.	Saa ara na na nkurɔfo no nso te.
Your time has come.	Wo bere adu.
Good job!	Adwuma pa!
And just enough to be a disaster.	Na nea ɛdɔɔso ara kwa sɛ ɛbɛyɛ asiane.
He has a strong presence.	Ɔwɔ baabi a ɛyɛ den.
I have to believe that if you ever become human.	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye di sɛ sɛ wobɛyɛ onipa da bi a.
However, there is a bigger issue here.	Nanso, asɛm kɛse bi wɔ ha.
I have to be good.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ papa.
But you wouldn’t know that, working outside your desk.	Nanso anka wunnim saa, na woreyɛ adwuma wɔ wo pon akyi.
I wanted my friends back.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me nnamfo no san ba.
Finally, it was over.	Awiei koraa no, na aba awiei.
The music ends.	Nnwom no ba awiei.
Maybe there was a letter for him there.	Ebia na krataa bi wɔ hɔ ma no wɔ hɔ.
How does one pronounce that name?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na obi bɔ saa din no?
Start your day.	Fi wo da no ase.
He is really good.	Ɔyɛ papa ankasa.
You are new to this.	Woyɛ foforo wɔ eyi mu.
There is no more lies.	Atoro nni hɔ bio.
But no one did.	Nanso obiara anyɛ saa.
So many different things.	Enti nneɛma ahorow pii.
That would have been pretty amazing.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Or even do it.	Anaasɛ mpo yɛ.
Don’t lie.	Nni atoro.
It’s easy to tell a story.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛka asɛm bi.
He is a wonderful person.	Ɔyɛ onipa a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
I agree with the former, but not the latter.	Me ne kan no yɛ adwene, nanso ɛnyɛ nea etwa to no.
Or not you right now.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ wo mprempren.
That no one thing should dominate.	Sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ade biako biara di so.
Data are from a single experiment.	Nsɛm a wɔde ama no fi sɔhwɛ biako mu.
It’s almost never fun to do that.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ anigye da sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
We couldn’t have done it without them.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ wɔn a, anka yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
I'm following yours.	Me de di wo de so.
Just then, the phone rang.	Saa bere no ara, telefon no bɔɔ.
How much does he do.	Ɔyɛ dodow ahe.
You have to think about it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
It was really really easy.	Na ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa ankasa.
They slipped through the water.	Wɔde wɔn ho faa nsu no mu.
However, it is highly unlikely.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye koraa.
His hair looked loose.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ti nhwi ayɛ mmerɛw.
I'm getting bigger.	Meyɛ kɛse.
You or anyone else.	Wo anaa obi foforo biara.
It’s hard to say which is best.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka nea eye sen biara.
It sounds like your experiment was successful.	Ɛte sɛ nea wo sɔhwɛ no dii yiye.
I have done it for many people.	Mayɛ ama nnipa pii.
And it all, like everyone else, works.	Na ne nyinaa, te sɛ obiara, yɛ adwuma.
The actual giving of life can save.	Nkwa a wɔde ma ankasa no betumi agye.
And it doesn’t matter.	Na ɛho nhia.
You can run this test in any order you like.	Wubetumi ayɛ sɔhwɛ yi wɔ nhyehyɛe biara a wopɛ mu.
Or when you doubt a lot.	Anaasɛ bere a wugye akyinnye pii no.
You need to see me soon.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu me ntɛm.
And that they do.	Na sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Good days, indeed.	Nna a eye, ampa.
This year, the time has come.	Afe yi, bere no adu.
Who knows where it will be next week.	Hena na onim baabi a ɛbɛyɛ dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
And there was nothing.	Na biribiara nni hɔ.
I would focus on something like that.	Anka mede m’adwene besi biribi a ɛte saa so.
That’s the point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no.
The day was over.	Ná ɛda no aba awiei.
This is not just about me.	Eyi nyɛ me nkutoo ho asɛm.
This is a picture of your new home.	Eyi yɛ wo fie foforo no ho mfonini.
One person means nothing.	Onipa biako nkyerɛ hwee.
So much talking!	Enti nsɛm pii a wɔka!
Give yourself time.	Ma wo ho bere.
Everything looks perfectly fine.	Biribiara hwɛ yiye koraa.
I don't care what you say.	Nea woka no mfa me ho.
I have an idea.	Mewɔ adwene bi.
She put food on the table for us.	Ɔde aduan too pon so maa yɛn.
I really enjoy doing it.	M’ani gye ho ankasa sɛ mɛyɛ.
I can’t be the only person here.	Mintumi nyɛ onipa nkutoo wɔ ha.
I'm not.	Me' no.
The water table is great.	Nsu a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ kɛse.
If there is, it is good.	Sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ a, eye.
However, few people care.	Nanso, nnipa kakraa bi na ɛho hia wɔn.
Know it like the back of my hand.	Hu no te sɛ me nsa akyi.
It’s good for you.	Ɛyɛ papa ma wo.
I believe in it now.	Migye di wɔ ho mprempren.
Everyone spoke the same language.	Ná obiara ka kasa koro.
He has a first now.	Ɔwɔ obi a odi kan mprempren.
It was the best of the best.	Ná ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
But most people don’t.	Nanso nnipa dodow no ara nyɛ saa.
This is what you do.	Eyi ne wo yɛ.
It was an interesting idea.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ anigye.
Just stay in your room.	Tra wo dan mu kɛkɛ.
He didn’t seem happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani nnye.
But none of that was true.	Nanso na ɛno mu biara nyɛ nokware.
However, the number is not large.	Nanso, dodow no nyɛ kɛse.
Nobody lets you go.	Obiara mma wo nkɔ.
Take risks with yourself.	Fa wo ho to asiane so.
Like before but much harder.	Te sɛ kan no nanso ɛyɛ den kɛse.
I think he has put his past in the past.	Misusuw sɛ ɔde ne bere a atwam no ahyɛ bere a atwam no mu.
Repeat with the other half.	Fa fã a aka no yɛ bio.
I wanted to take her with me.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mede no ka me ho.
Still fell down.	Da so ara hwee ase.
It’s absolutely horrible.	Ɛyɛ hu koraa.
It was very powerful.	Na tumi wom kɛse.
But you have made your bed.	Nanso woayɛ wo mpa no.
He was a very busy man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a onni adagyew koraa.
If it’s good, people will buy it.	Sɛ ɛyɛ papa a, nkurɔfo bɛtɔ.
But that’s him.	Nanso ɛno ne ɔno.
We can look at that later.	Yebetumi ahwɛ saa asɛm no akyiri yi.
Things were getting more complicated as time went on.	Ná nneɛma reyɛ den kɛse bere a bere kɔ so no.
There is no other time you can have that.	Bere foforo biara nni hɔ a wubetumi anya saa.
This was not easy.	Ná eyi nyɛ mmerɛw.
If he could, he would.	Sɛ obetumi a, na ɔbɛyɛ.
It’s not for everyone.	Ɛnyɛ obiara de.
Is there anyone who can , please?	So obi wɔ hɔ a obetumi , mesrɛ wo?
That just sounds like something you would do.	Ɛno te sɛ biribi a anka wobɛyɛ ara kwa.
Tomorrow there is no doubt about it.	Ɔkyena akyinnye biara nni ho.
I just found that out.	Mihuu saa asɛm no ara kwa.
It’s not that hard.	Ɛnyɛ den saa.
This last attempt was successful.	Mmɔden a etwa to yi dii nkonim.
None of them can do that.	Wɔn mu biara ntumi nyɛ saa.
That man seems to be out of control.	Ɛte sɛ nea saa ɔbarima no nni ne ho so.
This way please.	Saa kwan yi so mesrɛ wo.
Check out the location.	Hwɛ baabi a ɛwɔ.
It’s a human job.	Ɛyɛ onipa adwuma.
It is very large.	Ɛyɛ kɛse paa.
Which is not the best.	Nea ɛnyɛ nea eye sen biara.
I can’t believe it at this point.	Me ntumi nnye nni saa bere yi.
I don’t know his name.	Minnim ne din.
He was too strong.	Ná ne ho yɛ den dodo.
She had to be with her new baby first.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne ne ba foforo no di kan.
As it really was.	Sɛnea na ɛte ankasa.
He had done that a lot.	Ná wayɛ saa pii.
The back of the inside.	Akyi a ɛwɔ mu no.
So that’s it, he tells himself.	Enti ɛno ne no, ɔka kyerɛ ne ho.
The story was always the same.	Ná asɛm no yɛ ade koro bere nyinaa.
Inside, the room is nearly empty.	Wɔ mu no, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ dan no mu da hɔ.
All of that could really amount to nothing.	Ná saa nneɛma no nyinaa betumi ayɛ hwee ankasa.
Everything was scarce here.	Ná biribiara ho yɛ na wɔ ha.
He didn't know which part of it he disliked the most.	Ná onnim ne fã bɛn a n’ani nnye ho kɛse.
We have to, anyway.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa, ɔkwan biara so.
Not the girl.	Ɛnyɛ abeawa no.
If he didn’t want her that much.	Sɛ na ɔmpɛ no saa a.
That would be approximately .	Ɛno bɛyɛ sɛ .
The plan is the plan.	Nhyehyɛe no ne nhyehyɛe no.
We are troubled by many things.	Nneɛma pii haw yɛn.
He gave me a smile.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ me.
My mom did those things.	Me maame na ɔyɛɛ saa nneɛma no.
You’re not that bad.	Wonyɛ bɔne saa.
I thought it was important to go to one's own.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛho hia sɛ obi kɔ ne de nkyɛn.
His legs were close together.	Ná ne nan bɛn ho.
This is such a great day for you.	Eyi yɛ da kɛse a ɛte saa ma wo.
Everything else will probably stay the same.	Ebia biribiara a aka no bɛkɔ so ayɛ sɛnea ɛte no ara.
On the other hand, thank you for your support.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, meda mo ase wɔ mo mmoa no ho.
Fill your team with him if you can.	Fa no hyɛ wo kuw no ma sɛ wubetumi a.
You don’t have to work for him.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma ma no.
Two wonderful books.	Nhoma abien a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
They have to be done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
It’s a wonderful opportunity.	Ɛyɛ hokwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Everyone had the same opportunity.	Obiara nyaa hokwan koro no ara.
He had no power to save himself.	Ná onni tumi a ɔde begye ne ho.
A wonderful idea for me.	Adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa ma me.
Everyone needs to talk to me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara ne me kasa.
You have to save yourself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye wo ho.
It’s amazing!	Ɛyɛ nwonwa!
Here’s what’s beautiful.	Nea ɛyɛ fɛ ni.
Just enjoy it!.	Momma mo ani nnye ho kɛkɛ!.
So what do you think?	Enti dɛn na wususuw?
That circumstance, too, is not relevant in this case.	Saa tebea no nso, mfa ho wɔ asɛm yi mu.
This works very well.	Eyi yɛ adwuma yiye paa.
No one did that to him.	Obiara anyɛ no saa.
I cannot add classes to each table.	Mintumi mfa adesua ahorow nka ho wɔ pon biara so.
It’s good and it’s strong too.	Eye na ɛyɛ den nso.
That in itself was amazing.	Ná ɛno ankasa yɛ nwonwa.
In a moment he would do anything for her.	Wɔ bere tiaa bi mu no na ɔbɛyɛ biribiara ama no.
I’ll be happy with it.	M’ani begye ho.
He was very, very, very wet.	Ná ɔyɛ nsu kɛse, kɛse, yiye.
He wasn’t a human being.	Ná ɔnyɛ onipa.
The outside temperature is good.	Abɔnten so hyew no yɛ papa.
But you weren’t interested.	Nanso na w’ani nnye ho.
A lot of that.	Ɛno mu pii.
It was beautiful and perfect.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ pɛ.
Some things you need to do.	Nneɛma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
It was my favorite.	Ná ɛyɛ nea m’ani gye ho paa.
It doesn’t matter now.	Ɛnyɛ hwee mprempren.
You have already moved the items.	Wode nneɛma no akɔ baabi foforo dedaw.
As there certainly was one.	Sɛnea akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na biako wɔ hɔ no.
Not for any reason.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara nti.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni ho.
If it works for him, more power to him.	Sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma ma no a, tumi pii ma no.
Winter has come early.	Awɔw bere aba ntɛm.
I believe in this girl.	Migye saa abeawa yi di.
It might be better.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa.
Maybe you have one too.	Ebia wo nso wowɔ bi.
Beside me.	Wɔ me nkyɛn.
Give it a year or two.	Ma no afe biako anaa abien.
I talk to him almost every day.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ me ne no kasa da biara.
But one cannot anticipate it.	Nanso obi ntumi nni kan nsusuw ho ansa.
The story is over.	Asɛm no aba awiei.
That is far more important.	Ɛno ho hia kɛse koraa.
They are a great team and really took the game to us.	Wɔyɛ kuw kɛse na wɔde agoru no kɔɔ yɛn nkyɛn ankasa.
That was easy.	Ná ɛno yɛ mmerɛw.
This is a very interesting idea.	Eyi yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
Remember them, remember them well!.	Kae wɔn, kae wɔn yiye!.
I just want to keep going.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so ara nkɔ so kɛkɛ.
That may have been difficult.	Ebia na ɛno yɛ den.
He has the right to say what he wants to say.	Ɔwɔ hokwan sɛ ɔka nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka.
He knows that too.	Onim saa nso.
The power has been busy.	Tumi no ayɛ nea adagyew nnim.
But he could see her again.	Nanso na obetumi ahu no bio.
Who did this?	Hena na ɔyɛɛ eyi?
Anyone who wants it really has to try.	Obiara a ɔpɛ no, ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden ankasa.
But that will go on for a while.	Nanso ɛno bɛkɔ so akyɛ kakra.
She was strong, beautiful, and she belonged.	Ná ne ho yɛ den, ne ho yɛ fɛ, na na ɔyɛ ne de.
Later they are each other.	Akyiri yi wɔyɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
However, that is not necessarily the case.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea ɛte saa ankasa.
I didn’t want to tell you.	Na mempɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo.
It must be true.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
In recent years.	Wɔ nnansa yi mfe mu.
That’s it, the end.	Ɛno ne no, awiei no.
How he plays and plays his music.	Sɛnea ɔbɔ ne nnwom na ɔbɔ.
The music is just amazing.	Nnwom no yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
Only his mother.	Ne maame nkutoo.
However, doing this well is not easy.	Nanso, eyi a wobɛyɛ no yiye no nyɛ mmerɛw.
He is a powerful man.	Ɔyɛ onipa a ɔwɔ tumi.
Books with good information appeal to us.	Nhoma ahorow a nsɛm pa wom no gye yɛn ani.
No real person does that.	Onipa ankasa biara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ saa.
But in a strange way.	Nanso wɔ ɔkwan bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
I can put it in it.	Metumi de ahyɛ mu.
I’m really jealous of you.	M’ani bere wo ampa.
It was a wonderful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There must be more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ pii wɔ hɔ.
Once upon a time there was a shoemaker.	Bere bi a atwam no, na obi a ɔyɛ mpaboa wɔ hɔ.
He too, apparently.	Ɔno nso, ɛda adi sɛ.
This is a beautiful pair.	Eyi yɛ baanu a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
It certainly wasn’t that bad.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛnyɛ bɔne saa.
I can’t talk about it, ever.	Mintumi nka ho asɛm, da.
No easy way, right?	Ɔkwan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw biara nni hɔ, ɛnte saa?
I totally agree with that.	Migye saa asɛm no tom koraa.
I don’t know what before the season.	Minnim ade bɛn ansa na bere no adu.
It was our last shot.	Ná ɛyɛ yɛn tuo a etwa to.
, and.	, ne.
Just do it.	Yɛ kɛkɛ.
However, we have to plan for them at night.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ wɔn ho nhyehyɛe anadwo.
We can get that.	Yebetumi anya saa.
He looked strong.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ den.
I really wanted people to like our music.	Ná mepɛ sɛ nkurɔfo ani gye yɛn nnwom ho ankasa.
But it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛnyɛ hwee.
Remove the face.	Yi anim no fi adi.
So you know it was good.	Enti wunim sɛ na eye.
That was a few years ago.	Ɛno yɛ mfe kakraa bi a atwam ni.
Maybe that will work.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma.
He is that good.	Ɔyɛ saa papa no.
While this information is important.	Bere a saa nsɛm yi ho hia no.
The support is great.	Mmoa a wɔde ma no yɛ kɛse.
All forms of life are forms of life.	Nkwa ahorow nyinaa yɛ nkwa ahorow.
This control system is complex.	Saa nhyehyɛe a wɔde di dwuma yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
He has too much of his father in him.	Ɔwɔ ne papa pii dodo wɔ ne mu.
The accident happened on the way.	Akwanhyia no sii wɔ kwan so.
But the next time.	Nanso bere foforo no.
He looked down at her.	Ɔde n’ani too fam.
With a lot of power.	Ne tumi pii.
Prices do not always reflect the true value.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na nneɛma bo da ne bo ankasa adi.
This is such a good book.	Eyi yɛ nhoma pa a ɛte saa.
A little bit of it.	Kakraa bi ho.
Do it any way you like.	Yɛ no ɔkwan biara a wopɛ so.
At least let me do this.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ma menyɛ eyi.
Keep it simple.	Fa to hɔ ma ɛnyɛ den.
These books are no longer fashionable.	Saa nhoma ahorow yi nyɛ nea aba so bio.
We can’t even with this now.	Yɛrentumi mpo ne eyi mprempren.
He did so.	Ɔyɛɛ saa.
It wasn’t that cold.	Ná ɛnyɛ awɔw saa.
This is incredibly difficult.	Eyi yɛ den ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
The test case.	Sɔhwɛ asɛm no.
I almost felt bad about it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ metee nka bɔne wɔ ho.
This looks good to me.	Eyi hwɛ yiye ma me.
To speed things up, he had worked.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ na nneɛma ayɛ ntɛmntɛm no, na wayɛ adwuma.
Not even you.	Ɛnyɛ wo mpo.
However, our perspective is more opportunistic.	Nanso, yɛn adwene no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hokwan kɛse.
In the end it may have worked out for the best.	Awiei koraa no ebia ayɛ yiye ama nea eye sen biara.
Get out, get out, get out.	Fi adi, fi adi, fi adi.
At least you don’t want me to know.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wompɛ sɛ mihu.
At least he was real.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɔyɛ obi ankasa.
It was just down the road.	Ná ɛwɔ ɔkwan no so ara kwa.
See what we can come up with.	Hwɛ nea yebetumi de aba.
He was feeling cold.	Ná ɔte awɔw nka.
She is so beautiful, so beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye, ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Surely he can use it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ obetumi de adi dwuma.
Maybe it will work.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
How much more exciting.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
I thought we were in big trouble.	Misusuwii sɛ yɛwɔ ɔhaw kɛse bi mu.
As do most of his books.	Sɛnea ne nhoma ahorow no mu dodow no ara yɛ no.
It was important at the time.	Ná ɛho hia saa bere no.
I don’t like this.	M’ani nnye eyi ho.
It’s not a bad job.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma bɔne.
Or you think of something.	Anaasɛ wususuw biribi ho.
He could put his accomplishments on paper.	Ná obetumi de nea wayɛ no ahyɛ krataa so.
She is a very nice person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
This picture does not look like you.	Saa mfonini yi nte sɛ wo.
He yawned, and set a yawn.	Ɔde yaw, na ɔde yaw bi sii hɔ.
The excitement had gone.	Ná anigye no akɔ.
Are you forgetting something?	So wo werɛ mfi biribi?
Expensive things didn't seem to appeal.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea nneɛma a ne bo yɛ den ani nnye ho.
He had no packages.	Ná onni nneɛma a wɔde ahyɛ mu.
No soaking time is required.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔde bere biara hyɛ nsu mu.
I don’t know where it is.	Minnim baabi a ɛwɔ.
We have that.	Yɛwɔ saa.
I know there is good in you.	Minim sɛ papa wɔ wo mu.
It didn’t seem to be true.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nokware.
I am very sorry about this.	Ɛyɛ me yaw kɛse wɔ eyi ho.
Check out the meaning.	Hwɛ ne kyerɛ.
The problem was indeed.	Na ɔhaw no ampa.
I do watch a lot of them.	Mehwɛ wɔn pii ampa.
See the timeline below.	Hwɛ bere a wɔde yɛ adwuma wɔ ase hɔ.
His eyesight was poor.	Ná n’ani ntumi nhu ade yiye.
I just want to say thank you.	Mepɛ sɛ meka sɛ meda wo ase kɛkɛ.
The town itself doesn’t have much.	Kurow no ankasa nni nneɛma pii.
I think it was important.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛho hia.
More on his situation later.	Ne tebea no ho nsɛm pii akyiri yi.
Watch a game.	Hwɛ agoru bi.
Bad.	Nyɛ.
He slipped his hands together.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ mu.
Only with his mother.	Ɔne ne maame nkutoo.
He produced a lot of my music.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ me nnwom pii.
Most of his head was gone.	Ná ne ti fã kɛse no ara nni hɔ bio.
But let it be so.	Nanso ma ɛnyɛ saa.
Lunch is almost as easy.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ awia aduan yɛ mmerɛw saa ara.
The child puts his hand on the table.	Abofra no de ne nsa hyɛ pon no so.
How many parties have you hosted so far?	Apontow ahorow ahe na woayɛ de besi nnɛ?
His head seemed large.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ti yɛ kɛse.
Nothing could be better then.	Saa bere no biribiara ntumi nyɛ papa sen eyi.
It seems simple enough.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Ɛnyɛ ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobɛyɛ.
I did it for him.	Meyɛɛ no.
It was unmistakable.	Ná ɛyɛ nea akyinnye biara nni ho.
I never knew why.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa da.
But they were disappointed.	Nanso na wɔn abam abu.
The children were in bed.	Ná mmofra no da mpa so.
This is now a given.	Mprempren eyi yɛ ade a wɔde ama yɛn.
The meeting was a wonderful day.	Ná nhyiam no yɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye.
These days, many species are endangered.	Nna yi, mmoa ahorow pii wɔ asiane mu.
What you say.	Nea woka.
And they make some really good music.	Na wɔyɛ nnwom pa bi ankasa.
It wasn’t really to my liking.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea m’ani gye ho ankasa.
I don’t like language.	M’ani nnye kasa ho.
That’s how they sin.	Saa na wɔyɛ bɔne.
Make no mistake, this is our time.	Nni mfomso, eyi ne yɛn bere.
I'm really telling the truth here.	Meka nokware ankasa wɔ ha.
But there was nothing.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ.
Which is just amazing.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
Is that you? 	So ɛno ne wo?
All you have to do is be strong.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ara ne sɛ woyɛ den.
He was the one.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔno.
I have always been a practitioner.	Meyɛ obi a ɔyɛ adwuma bere nyinaa.
And he told me they had to.	Na ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
That makes it more interesting.	Ɛno ma ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
Take some time about it.	Gye bere kakra fa ho.
Everything this dog wanted was his.	Biribiara a na ɔkraman yi pɛ no, na ɛyɛ ne de.
My head was hurting.	Ná me ti yɛ me yaw.
Water is essential for life.	Nsu ho hia ma nkwa.
He used it well.	Ɔde dii dwuma yiye.
No one did anything.	Obiara anyɛ hwee.
You don’t have to know anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wuhu hwee.
She is really beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ ankasa.
Anyone can claim to be anyone, as a matter of fact.	Obiara betumi aka sɛ ɔyɛ obiara, sɛnea ɛte no.
I can’t figure out what it was like.	Mintumi nhu sɛnea na ɛte.
Maybe someone else has.	Ebia obi foforo nso ayɛ saa.
This cat is the size of a cat.	Saa ɔkraman yi kɛse te sɛ ɔkraman.
He had said it himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa aka.
If it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee a, ɛnyɛ hwee.
They have to work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma.
However, the plan did not work.	Nanso, nhyehyɛe no ankɔ yiye.
Not out there and you.	Ɛnyɛ abɔnten hɔ na wo.
However, it is good to do so.	Nanso, eye sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
It doesn’t cost anything.	Ɛho nnye hwee.
It has some good features.	Ɛwɔ nneɛma pa bi.
It’s perfect and beautiful.	Ɛyɛ pɛ na ɛyɛ fɛ.
The meeting may still be in progress.	Ebia nhyiam no da so ara rekɔ so.
He is so wonderful.	Ɔyɛ nwonwa yiye.
He didn't know what to do.	Ná onnim nea ɔnyɛ.
And that has happened in the past.	Na ɛno nso asi wɔ bere a atwam no mu.
If only he could reach them.	Sɛ obetumi adu wɔn nkyɛn kɛkɛ a.
At that point he no longer cared what was going on.	Saa bere no na nea ɛrekɔ so no mfa ne ho bio.
Absolutely one of my favorite movies.	Sini ahorow a m’ani gye ho paa no mu biako koraa.
Finally, it has a sexual component.	Awiei koraa no, ɛwɔ nna ho fã bi.
He hoped there was room.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ baabi wɔ hɔ.
This is a gateway.	Eyi yɛ ɔpon a wɔde di dwuma.
And the other kids.	Na mmofra a aka no nso.
He needs to be told that it exists.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka kyerɛ no sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
It’s a systemic problem.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe ho haw.
A gunshot rang out.	Tuo bi bɔɔ denneennen.
Treat them like human beings.	Fa wɔn di sɛ nnipa.
Children need more sleep.	Mmofra hia nna pii.
That didn’t work out.	Ɛno ankɔ yiye.
I just have to tell you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo ara kwa.
This was such a day.	Na eyi yɛ da a ɛte saa.
There was a lot of money involved.	Ná sika kɛse wɔ mu.
Or my own.	Anaasɛ me de no.
I was nothing and nobody.	Ná menyɛ hwee na na menyɛ obiara.
They shared the same interests.	Ná wɔn ani gye nneɛma koro ho.
There are no pictures in his book.	Mfonini biara nni ne nhoma no mu.
Say things that may be true.	Ka nsɛm a ebia ɛyɛ nokware.
And you know what he looks like.	Na wunim sɛnea ɔte.
I believe people teach well.	Migye di sɛ nkurɔfo kyerɛ ade yiye.
I look into my eyes and keep running.	Mehwɛ m’ani so na mekɔ so tu mmirika.
The result is that.	Nea afi mu aba ne sɛ.
It’s still there.	Ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
You want nothing to do with him.	Wompɛ sɛ wo ne no bɛyɛ hwee.
He has a good reputation in the city.	Ɔwɔ din pa wɔ kurow no mu.
Friends turn to friends.	Nnamfo dan kɔ nnamfo so.
Give him a good month.	Ma no ɔsram pa.
Go back there immediately.	San kɔ hɔ ntɛm ara.
And he never even knew.	Na na onnim mpo da.
The same goes for touch.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nsa a wɔde ka obi ho.
That we were intertwined.	Sɛ na yɛde yɛn ho abɔ yɛn ho mu.
If it’s a mistake.	Sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
It’s a difficult issue.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ den.
It all happened by itself.	Ne nyinaa ankasa sii.
Make it work for everything.	Ma no nyɛ adwuma mma biribiara.
You’re interested in the truth.	W’ani gye nokware no ho.
Almost everyone.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara.
Thank you both so much.	Meda mo baanu nyinaa ase pii.
The books are very full.	Nhoma ahorow no ayɛ ma kɛse.
I didn’t mean to do that.	Ná ɛnyɛ m’adwene sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
But such a thing was impossible.	Nanso na ade a ɛte saa no ntumi nyɛ yiye.
That was my name.	Ná ɛno ne me din.
It was okay, really.	Na ɛnyɛ hwee, ampa.
What is the real situation.	Tebea ankasa ne dɛn.
I am still a child.	Meda so ara yɛ abofra.
As time went on, people forgot about the past.	Bere kɔɔ so no, nkurɔfo werɛ fii nneɛma a atwam no.
What would you say?.	Dɛn na wobɛka?.
He was always alert.	Ná n’ani da hɔ bere nyinaa.
It was never pretty.	Ná ɛnyɛ fɛ da.
So that’s what’s happening.	Enti ɛno ne nea ɛrekɔ so.
Or anything, really.	Anaasɛ biribiara, ampa.
Nothing was an issue.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ asɛm.
That strikes me as probably wrong.	Ɛno yɛ me nwonwa sɛ ebia ɛyɛ mfomso.
The house is filled with old and new books.	Nhoma dedaw ne foforo ahyɛ ofie no mu ma.
Something else is going on here.	Biribi foforo nso rekɔ so wɔ ha.
The water is clear today.	Nsu no mu da hɔ nnɛ.
Is it perfect?	So ɛyɛ pɛ?
One thing for sure.	Ade biako a ɛyɛ nokware.
It was great to see him last night.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye kɛse sɛ mihuu no anadwo a etwaam no.
It seems much better.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye sen saa koraa.
He does the work for you.	Ɔno na ɔyɛ adwuma no ma wo.
On a book.	Wɔ nhoma bi so.
I heard it.	Metee no.
But you can go too far.	Nanso wubetumi akɔ akyiri dodo.
The presence of the child surprised me.	Abofra no a ɔwɔ hɔ no maa me ho dwiriw me.
Once it was more important than money.	Bere bi na ɛho hia sen sika.
I had to do my homework today.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ me fie nnwuma nnɛ.
But apart from that, the story remains.	Nanso sɛ ɛno da nkyɛn a, asɛm no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
This is a remarkable statement.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Everything this dog wanted was his.	Biribiara a na ɔkraman yi pɛ no, na ɛyɛ ne de.
Enough time has passed.	Bere a ɛdɔɔso atwam.
What you have right now.	Nea wowɔ mprempren yi ara.
Give it some time to work.	Ma no bere kakra ma ɛnyɛ adwuma.
Make your home as beautiful as possible.	Ma wo fie nyɛ fɛ sɛnea wubetumi biara.
I didn’t know what the man’s name was.	Ná minnim nea ɔbarima no din de.
That means you are human.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ woyɛ onipa.
And it hurt us.	Na ɛyɛ yɛn yaw.
He snuggled up to her, and clenched his fists.	Ɔde ne ho bɔɔ ne ho, na ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ mu.
Right now, for a moment, it feels wonderful.	Mprempren yi ara, bere tiaa mu no, ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There is no such thing in a crisis.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa wɔ ɔhaw bi mu.
Go do something nice for someone.	Kɔ yɛ biribi a ɛyɛ fɛ ma obi.
Unless you actually have something better.	Gye sɛ wowɔ biribi a eye sen saa ankasa.
He was in the car.	Ná ɔwɔ kar no mu.
Nothing will be the same.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛbɛyɛ saa ara.
This time, it seems, it doesn’t matter.	Ɛte sɛ nea saa bere yi de, ɛnyɛ nea ɛho nhia.
Which is amazing.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It’s a great hope.	Ɛyɛ anidaso kɛse.
However, he talks to me about a project.	Nanso, ɔne me kasa fa adwuma bi a mɛyɛ ho.
He looked worse.	Ná ne ho yɛ bɔne sen saa.
My mind was very blank.	Ná m’adwene yɛ nea ɛnyɛ hwee koraa.
Tom presents himself as an innovator.	Tom da ne ho adi sɛ obi a ɔyɛ nneɛma foforo.
Everything should be fine now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribiara yɛ yiye mprempren.
Interesting about it, no doubt.	Anigye wɔ ho, akyinnye biara nni ho.
We can work here.	Yebetumi ayɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
He knew what they had to do.	Ná onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
The price of almost everything had dropped.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na biribiara bo akɔ fam.
I see no need to go further.	Mihu sɛ ɛho nhia sɛ mekɔ akyiri.
Certainly not with me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ me nkyɛn.
Many people felt the same way.	Nnipa pii nso tee nka saa ara.
I know what I see.	Minim nea mihu.
Even after hours it’s still there.	Nnɔnhwerew akyi mpo no ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
Before he recovered.	Ansa na ne ho bɛtɔ no.
It’s been good.	Ayɛ papa.
I really enjoyed the party.	M’ani gyee apontow no ho yiye.
It wasn’t really him.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɔno ankasa.
We can get it understood.	Yebetumi anya no ase.
I really don’t know.	Ankasa minnim.
This can be good and bad.	Eyi betumi ayɛ papa ne bɔne.
So you can see why paper is so hard for me.	Enti wubetumi ahu nea enti a krataa yɛ den ma me no.
The dog is under the table.	Ɔkraman no wɔ pon no ase.
Don't need it.	Nhia no.
It was completely my fault.	Ná ɛyɛ me mfomso koraa.
He had to make a mistake.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ odi mfomso.
It is given at the end.	Wɔde ama awiei.
I’m not too happy about the situation.	M’ani nnye ho dodo wɔ tebea no ho.
Partly because there were so few books.	Ne fã bi ne sɛ na nhoma kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
So the numbers don’t tell the whole story.	Enti dodow no nka asɛm no nyinaa.
Sit me up front.	Fa me tra ase wɔ anim.
Who knows why that is.	Hena na onim nea enti a ɛte saa.
That’s a good thing to remember.	Ɛno yɛ ade pa a ɛsɛ sɛ wokae.
This is quite an interesting story.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye koraa.
The story had made him happy.	Ná asɛm no ama n’ani agye.
It totally works.	Ɛyɛ adwuma koraa.
It’s a great one.	Ɛyɛ kɛse.
I don’t like it very much.	M’ani nnye ho kɛse.
Or so she told him.	Anaasɛ saa na ɔka kyerɛɛ no.
The test was severe.	Ná sɔhwɛ no mu yɛ den.
It wasn’t that long ago.	Ná ɛnyɛ bere tenten ni saa.
Think about it that way.	Susuw ho saa.
The frequency of measurements was not significant.	Ná mpɛn dodow a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho no nyɛ nea ɛho hia.
Keep things simple for yourself.	Ma nneɛma nyɛ mmerɛw mma wo ho.
In a way it is true.	Ɔkwan bi so no ɛyɛ nokware.
If this is not the case, it is not.	Sɛ eyi nyɛ saa a, ɛnte saa.
I also love to draw.	M’ani gye ho nso sɛ mɛyɛ mfonini.
They are very sensitive to the touch.	Wɔn ho yɛ den yiye bere a wɔde wɔn nsa ka wɔn no.
Not without his help.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ne mmoa nka ho.
I know one thing.	Minim ade biako.
The night is like .	Anadwo no te sɛ .
I signed it off.	Mede me nsa hyɛɛ ase.
It all happened very quickly.	Ne nyinaa sii ntɛmntɛm paa.
Tell me this.	Ka eyi kyerɛ me.
It didn’t matter to me.	Ná ɛnyɛ hwee mma me.
Other than that, though, it’s easy to do.	Nanso, sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ.
He was very impressed with her.	N’ani gyee ne ho yiye.
Not in here.	Ɛnyɛ ha mu.
You are nothing to me.	Wonyɛ hwee mma me.
There is no work after this.	Adwuma biara nni hɔ wɔ eyi akyi.
The other night.	Anadwo foforo no.
I don’t know what to do.	Minnim nea menyɛ.
That’s not a lot of money going to anyone.	Ɛno nyɛ sika pii a ɛrekɔ obiara nkyɛn.
He knows me now.	Onim me mprempren.
I have to take care of myself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ me ho yiye.
It wasn’t much.	Ná ɛnyɛ pii.
I'm a little excited.	M'ani agye kakra.
You’ll be very happy.	W’ani begye kɛse.
It had taken too long.	Ná agye bere tenten dodo.
The days are getting warmer.	Nna no reyɛ hyew kɛse.
I want to say that.	Mepɛ sɛ meka sɛ.
The matter was his and his alone.	Ná asɛm no yɛ ne de ne ne nkutoo.
Nothing comes out.	Biribiara mfi adi.
It shouldn’t be that way.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
Apart from us, there was absolutely no room.	Sɛ yɛn da nkyɛn a, na baabi nni hɔ koraa.
Something else is at work.	Biribi foforo nso reyɛ adwuma.
The years have been difficult for him.	Mfe no ayɛ den ama no.
He was a successful man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a odi yiye.
But the place still hurt.	Nanso na baabi no da so ara yɛ no yaw.
But you will do that.	Nanso wobɛyɛ saa.
Certainly this time.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ saa bere yi.
These people have many children.	Saa nkurɔfo yi wɔ mma pii.
You can also indulge in a really simple diet.	Wubetumi nso de wo ho ahyɛ aduan a ɛnyɛ den ankasa so.
It’s more beautiful in person.	Ɛyɛ fɛ kɛse wɔ ankasa mu.
No one knows what dramatic consequences this can have.	Obiara nnim nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa a eyi betumi de aba.
We provide information about them.	Yɛde wɔn ho nsɛm ma.
I want to be there so bad.	Mepɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ bɔne saa.
The police left the house.	Polisifo no fii fie hɔ.
Who knows what it might be.	Hena na onim nea ebia ɛbɛyɛ.
Transfer the water to another container.	Fa nsu no hyɛ ade foforo mu.
Believe me, they do.	Gye me di, wɔyɛ saa.
I know how to use those.	Minim sɛnea mede saa nneɛma no bedi dwuma.
. . . .	.
He just thought he was.	Ná osusuw ara kwa sɛ ɔte saa.
That’s one of the things we do well at.	Ɛno ne nneɛma a yɛyɛ yiye wɔ mu no mu biako.
I was expecting that	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ
That is not so easy.	Ɛno nyɛ mmerɛw koraa saa.
They offered each other support and hope.	Wɔde mmoa ne anidaso maa wɔn ho wɔn ho.
That doesn’t mean it’s ever been entirely true.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ ayɛ nokware koraa pɛn.
Both articles were interesting.	Nsɛm abien no nyinaa ani gyee ho.
Years had come to an end.	Ná mfe bi aba awiei.
Another drop fell.	Nsu foforo bi nso hwee ase.
In other words.	Ɔkwan foforo so no.
Not just yet, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren ara, ɔkwan biara so.
The food was even out of date most of the time.	Ná aduan no bere atwam mpo mpɛn dodow no ara.
In that year.	Wɔ saa afe no mu.
And another one after that.	Na foforo nso wɔ ɛno akyi.
This does not seem to be the case.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi nte saa.
There was only one that was absolutely perfect.	Ná biako pɛ wɔ hɔ a na ɛyɛ pɛ koraa.
This also bothers me.	Eyi nso haw me.
It’s not my truth.	Ɛnyɛ me nokware.
I know that much.	Minim saa pii.
And tomorrow, too.	Na ɔkyena nso.
Not complicated enough.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ.
There was something else, though.	Nanso, na biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
At least something like that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, biribi a ɛte saa.
I'm too busy to go.	Me nni adagyew dodo sɛ mɛkɔ.
The music was loud.	Ná nnwom no ano yɛ den.
I hoped it would be good.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ papa.
He certainly doesn’t know himself.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔno ankasa nnim.
I put everything into it.	Mede biribiara hyɛ mu.
He had to play the game.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ agoru no.
Which was a lot of fun.	Nea na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
What you were both wearing.	Nea na mo baanu nyinaa hyɛ.
None of this anyone could have told you at the time.	Eyi mu biara nni hɔ a na obiara ntumi nka nkyerɛ wo saa bere no.
He was obviously unhappy.	Ɛda adi sɛ na onni anigye biara.
The testing continued throughout the school year.	Sɔhwɛ no kɔɔ so wɔ sukuu afe mũ no nyinaa mu.
That’s the most amazing thing.	Ɛno ne ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen biara.
This was not something he understood very well.	Ná eyi nyɛ ade a ɔte ase yiye.
Not in that way.	Ɛnyɛ saa kwan no so.
One has to look at the facts.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi hwɛ sɛnea asɛm no te.
In ????????? 	Mu ?????????
Before it’s too late.	Ansa na aka akyi dodo.
He always carries it with him.	Ɔde ka ne ho bere nyinaa.
I can’t sleep.	Mintumi nna.
It’s very cold.	Ɛyɛ awɔw kɛse.
I had done it so many times.	Ná mayɛ no mpɛn pii saa.
It just doesn’t do that.	Ɛyɛ saa ara kwa.
This point is discussed later.	Wɔka asɛm yi ho asɛm akyiri yi.
They are now.	Wɔyɛ mprempren.
A city ruled by sin.	Kurow a bɔne di so.
Everything in this room was in shambles.	Ná biribiara a ɛwɔ dan yi mu no ayɛ mmerɛw.
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He knew me, he knew me.	Ná onim me, na onim me.
Talk about a problem.	Ka ɔhaw ho asɛm.
You can let it go.	Wubetumi ama akɔ.
There is a door at the end of the hallway.	Ɔpon bi wɔ ɔkwan no awiei.
The day comes to an end.	Da no ba awiei.
Look and see.	Hwɛ na hwɛ.
This is the whole point.	Eyi ne asɛm no nyinaa.
He glanced at the picture of his father.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ne papa mfonini no.
For simple tasks, everything obviously works fine.	Wɔ nnwuma a ɛnyɛ den ho no, ɛda adi sɛ biribiara yɛ adwuma yiye.
And great, too.	Na kɛse nso.
It was easy to get along with people.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wo ne nkurɔfo bɛbɔ.
It didn’t look bad.	Ná ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne.
What are your favorite songs?	Nnwom bɛn na w’ani gye ho paa?
I immediately fell in love with him.	M’ani gyee ne ho ntɛm ara.
A couple of them glared at them.	Wɔn mu baanu bi de wɔn ani kyerɛɛ wɔn.
But he knew me.	Nanso na onim me.
He wants to win.	Ɔpɛ sɛ odi nkonim.
I knew him well enough.	Ná minim no yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
That was a moment for sure.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere tiaa bi a ɛyɛ nokware.
And the rest of them, too.	Na wɔn a aka no nso.
The problem is.	Ɔhaw no.
His hands got something easy.	Ne nsa kaa biribi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
This is not because there is no need for more information.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ nsɛm pii nti na eyi te saa.
You are surprising me tonight.	Woreyɛ me nwonwa anadwo yi.
This was not pretty.	Ná eyi nyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
You’ll be fine.	Wobɛyɛ yiye.
You want things to be perfect.	Wopɛ sɛ nneɛma yɛ pɛ.
But remember you do.	Nanso kae sɛ woyɛ saa.
Take my hand!	Fa me nsa!
Part of it seemed missing.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne fã bi nni hɔ.
Both seem to work well.	Ɛte sɛ nea abien no nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye.
He added one more.	Ɔde biako bio kaa ho.
I was a boy, I couldn’t do that.	Na meyɛ abarimaa, na mintumi nyɛ saa.
He knew it was wonderful.	Ná onim sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
One night.	Anadwo biako.
The words are simple, but not easy to say.	Nsɛm no yɛ mmerɛw, nanso ɛnyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobɛka.
I think they are good.	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ papa.
I had to tell my dad.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ me papa.
There's a chance again next week for the first time.	Hokwan wɔ hɔ bio dapɛn a edi hɔ no nea edi kan.
Keep thinking about things.	Kɔ so susuw nneɛma ho.
But enough of them.	Nanso ɛdɔɔso wɔ wɔn ho.
Got.	Nyaa.
I did, and it still doesn't work.	Meyɛɛ saa, na ɛda so ara nyɛ adwuma.
Remember the picture when.	Kae mfonini no bere a.
I don't know how yet, or where.	Minnim ɔkwan bɛn so de besi nnɛ, anaa baabi a ɛwɔ.
There was a problem though.	Na ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ nanso.
There was no consensus.	Ná adwene koro biara nni hɔ.
I did think he was very very scary.	Misusuwii ampa sɛ na ne ho yɛ hu yiye paa.
Someone was involved.	Obi na ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
Don’t think it’s a bad thing, though.	Nanso, nsusuw sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne.
Or even in a good way.	Anaasɛ mpo wɔ ɔkwan pa so.
The important thing is.	Ade a ɛho hia no.
It all just happened.	Ne nyinaa sii ara kwa.
He's doing a good job.	Ɔreyɛ adwuma pa.
It didn’t look like he could get into any more trouble.	Na ɛnyɛ te sɛ nea obetumi akɔ ɔhaw biara mu bio.
There wasn’t much to that.	Ná nneɛma pii nni saa asɛm no mu.
After this table.	Wɔ saa pon yi akyi.
I’m not going to do that.	M’ani nnye ho sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
Many people commented on the book.	Nnipa pii kaa nhoma no ho asɛm.
Water is more scarce than many believe.	Nsu ho yɛ na sen sɛnea nnipa pii gye di no.
Now, everyone is happy.	Seesei, obiara ani agye.
Personally, I don’t care.	Ankasa, ɛnyɛ me asɛm.
Demonstrate how to make a letter.	Kyerɛ sɛnea wɔyɛ krataa.
Truth that one has.	Nokware sɛ obi wɔ.
There were many things we could do to help.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ de aboa.
He was too wonderful.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa dodo.
We can be somewhere.	Yebetumi ayɛ baabi.
He must have been involved for years.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho ahyɛ mu mfe pii.
The tests will always be greater.	Bere biara, sɔhwɛ ahorow no bɛyɛ kɛse.
Tell me where to take you.	Ka baabi a mede wo bɛkɔ kyerɛ me.
None of these things existed.	Ná saa nneɛma yi mu biara nni hɔ.
Or what people believe about themselves.	Anaasɛ nea nnipa gye di wɔ wɔn ho.
It is also possible to provide more complex attributes.	Ɛyɛ yiye nso sɛ wɔde su ahorow a ɛyɛ den kɛse bɛma.
It’s not a car accident.	Ɛnyɛ kar akwanhyia.
I can’t imagine ever being in one situation at all.	Mintumi nsusuw ho sɛ mɛkɔ tebea biako mu koraa da.
There’s not much there.	Ɛnyɛ pii na ɛwɔ hɔ.
But it doesn’t work here.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
There is little hope in this way.	Anidaso kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ wɔ saa kwan yi so.
It just doesn’t do that.	Ɛyɛ saa ara kwa.
Take two and a half years if you want.	Fa mfe abien ne fã sɛ wopɛ a.
He knows too much.	Onim nneɛma pii dodo.
But there are a few surprises about it.	Nanso nneɛma kakraa bi wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ho.
There is no one.	Obiara nni hɔ.
This saves time for everyone.	Eyi mma obiara nnya bere.
They are all hopeless.	Wɔn nyinaa nni anidaso biara.
The summer was winding down.	Ná awɔw bere no rekɔ fam.
You don’t have to tell them.	Ɛho nhia sɛ woka kyerɛ wɔn.
And the story, too.	Na asɛm no nso.
Obviously you can tell us a little bit about it.	Ɛda adi sɛ wubetumi aka ho asɛm kakra akyerɛ yɛn.
However, there are two things.	Nanso, nneɛma abien na ɛwɔ hɔ.
That’s the next job.	Ɛno ne adwuma a edi hɔ.
We can make any effort.	Yebetumi abɔ mmɔden biara.
That’s just the problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no ara kwa.
Whatever it was, it no longer mattered.	Nea na ɛyɛ biara no, na ɛho nhia bio.
Play it right.	Bɔ no yiye.
A letter is attached.	Wɔde krataa bi aka ho.
I am right here for you too.	Mewɔ ha yi ara ma wo nso.
We have to make time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ bere.
Both the food and the atmosphere were beautiful.	Ná aduan ne tebea no nyinaa yɛ fɛ yiye.
It was extremely rare.	Ná ɛho yɛ na koraa.
He's here somewhere, and he's in trouble.	Ɔwɔ ha baabi, na ɔwɔ ɔhaw mu.
He certainly wasn’t.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔnyɛ saa.
This was all true.	Ná eyi nyinaa yɛ nokware.
The information is about you.	Nsɛm no fa wo ho.
He was not in the phone book.	Ná onni telefon nhoma no mu.
Keep your eyes on that!.	Ma w’ani nkɔ so saa!.
The next car is going.	Kar a edi hɔ no rekɔ.
But everything else too.	Nanso biribiara a aka no nso.
It was an incredibly powerful idea.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene a tumi wom a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Nobody really knows much about it.	Obiara nnim ho nsɛm pii ankasa.
All the pictures are very interesting and beautiful.	Mfonini ahorow no nyinaa yɛ anigye yiye na ɛyɛ fɛ.
You are a little bit.	Woyɛ kakraa bi.
Tell me more about this city.	Ka kurow yi ho nsɛm pii kyerɛ me.
But he did it.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ saa.
This happened fairly quickly.	Eyi sii ntɛmntɛm koraa.
He wanted to feel it.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte nka.
No problem with that.	Ɔhaw biara nni saa asɛm no ho.
That was part of the plan.	Ná ɛno yɛ nhyehyɛe no fã.
Imagine someone like you, but not you.	Fa no sɛ obi te sɛ wo, nanso ɛnyɛ wo.
We should do the same thing.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa ara.
I'm so excited and happy for you.	M'ani agye yiye na m'ani agye ma wo.
You know him.	Wunim no.
But we have to do that.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Old stuff, my dad said.	Nneɛma dedaw, me papa kae.
I just wanted to make sure that was there.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ hu sɛ ɛno wɔ hɔ ara kwa.
There was nothing in it.	Ná biribiara nni mu.
He was very busy.	Ná onni adagyew koraa.
He didn't know what else to do.	Ná onnim nea ɔnyɛ bio.
He knew it was true.	Ná onim sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
Many manufacturers prefer this approach.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ nneɛma no pii pɛ saa kwan yi.
Not everyone wanted to hear the news.	Ɛnyɛ onipa biara na na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte nsɛm no.
He doesn’t really.	Ɔnyɛ saa ampa.
That’s how he is with me.	Saa na ɔne me te.
Everything was going so well.	Ná biribiara rekɔ so yiye saa.
Run if you can.	Sɛ wubetumi a, tu mmirika.
I have been working on this project for years.	Mayɛ adwuma mfe pii wɔ saa adwuma yi ho.
' hand.	' nsa.
I knew what you wanted.	Ná minim nea wopɛ.
I don’t agree with him.	Me ne no nyɛ adwene.
We will schedule the test later.	Yɛbɛyɛ sɔhwɛ no ho nhyehyɛe akyiri yi.
But that doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛno ho nhia.
The two made a perfect team.	Wɔn baanu no yɛɛ kuw a edi mũ.
I didn't even know it was still there.	Ná minnim mpo sɛ ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
But contractors do not determine the quality of a job.	Nanso wɔn a wɔyɛ adwuma no nkyerɛ sɛnea adwuma bi te.
He was really fast.	Ná ɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm ankasa.
It may very well be a lie.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ atoro yiye.
The police are involved.	Polisifo no de wɔn ho ahyɛ mu.
That is certainly possible.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye.
He nodded sharply.	Ɔde ne ti bɔɔ fam denneennen.
The floor was warm under our feet.	Ná fam hɔ yɛ hyew wɔ yɛn nan ase.
There is nothing else.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
He had to tell her.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ no.
I just thought you might know.	Misusuwii ara ne sɛ ebia wunim.
He had a mind.	Ná ɔwɔ adwene.
There was no reason for it.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
You can work where and when you want.	Wubetumi ayɛ adwuma wɔ baabi a wopɛ ne bere a wopɛ.
And you know it, too.	Na wo nso wunim.
But your mother is also very strong.	Nanso wo maame nso ho yɛ den yiye.
Many things will be terrible.	Nneɛma pii bɛyɛ hu.
His house was very expensive.	Ná ne fie no bo yɛ den yiye.
He wants this.	Ɔpɛ eyi.
And a lot more when my kids were home.	Na pii nso bere a na me mma no wɔ fie no.
Grade.	Aba.
Without a doubt, it was.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛte saa.
Add real value.	Fa bo ankasa ka ho.
Anyone can do it.	Obiara betumi ayɛ.
But he makes mistakes, so he makes big mistakes.	Nanso odi mfomso, enti odi mfomso kɛse.
A beautiful summer day	Awɔw bere mu da a ɛyɛ fɛ
He wanted my room.	Ná ɔpɛ me dan no.
This was not a new idea.	Ná eyi nyɛ adwene foforo.
He was sitting there.	Ná ɔte hɔ.
So much has happened since then.	Enti nneɛma pii akɔ so fi saa bere no.
This can be huge.	Eyi betumi ayɛ kɛse.
Many people found this strange.	Nnipa pii hui sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa.
Just the way he wanted it.	Sɛnea na ɔpɛ no ara pɛ.
I'm sorry it had to be you.	Mepa wo kyɛw sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo.
No one goes there.	Obiara nkɔ hɔ.
It was our thing.	Ná ɛyɛ yɛn ade.
It must have all been true.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ne nyinaa yɛ nokware.
Everyone, even the kids, had a job to do.	Ná obiara, mmofra no mpo, wɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
It’s because you are great at what you do.	Ɛyɛ nea woyɛ kɛse wɔ nea woyɛ no mu nti.
It’s not easy, but it’s easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw, nanso ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Who lives in that house there?	Hena na ɔte saa fie no mu wɔ hɔ?
A more complicated system.	Nhyehyɛe a ɛyɛ den kɛse a wɔde di dwuma.
He knew exactly what that felt like.	Ná onim sɛnea ɛno te nka ankasa.
The thing is complicated.	Ade no ayɛ den.
Maybe there is.	Ebia ɛwɔ hɔ.
It’s weird to be around him like that.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ wobɛka ne ho saa.
Not that it’s a bad idea.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwene bɔne.
I feel things.	Mete nneɛma nka.
He had no idea what to do next.	Ná onni nea ɔbɛyɛ akyi no ho adwene biara.
I wanted to know if anyone would tell me first.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛ ebia obi bedi kan aka akyerɛ me anaa.
It’s a good investment.	Ɛyɛ sika a wɔde di dwuma yiye.
It doesn’t seem to be.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ saa.
He was absolutely devastated.	Ná n’adwene ayɛ no yaw koraa.
Find me!	Di me!
It’s like everywhere else now.	Ɛte sɛ baabi foforo biara mprempren.
Children were happy with excitement.	Ná mmofra ani agye a wɔn ani agye.
I felt better about myself.	Me ho tɔɔ me.
Maybe that’s his favorite.	Ebia ɛno ne nea n’ani gye ho kɛse.
I know it’s bad for me.	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne ma me.
But that’s the way it is with me.	Nanso saa na ɛte wɔ me ho.
I have used it for a long time without any issues.	Mede adi dwuma bere tenten a nsɛm biara nni ho.
Nothing has worked.	Biribiara nyɛɛ adwuma.
Tell me what you think of the room!.	Ka nea wususuw wɔ dan no ho kyerɛ me!.
And you can get what you want faster and faster.	Na wubetumi anya nea wopɛ no ntɛmntɛm na woayɛ ntɛm.
I also know it’s good for him.	Minim nso sɛ eye ma no.
Just, here you are.	Kɛkɛ, ha na wowɔ.
They were all full.	Ná wɔn nyinaa ayɛ ma.
People are already going there.	Nkurɔfo rekɔ hɔ dedaw.
This is the best day ever.	Eyi ne da a eye sen biara.
He wasn't much help.	Ná ɔnyɛ mmoa kɛse.
Look at this picture.	Hwɛ saa mfonini yi.
He has a difficult story.	Ɔwɔ asɛm bi a ɛyɛ den.
He was ahead of his time.	Ná odi ne bere anim.
But that is part of the story.	Nanso ɛno ka asɛm no ho.
I don’t want anything else from you.	Mempɛ biribi foforo biara mfi wo hɔ.
These songs will get your feet going.	Saa nnwom yi bɛma wo nan akɔ so.
So that shouldn’t be a big deal by any means.	Enti ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse ɔkwan biara so.
However, there was a major problem.	Nanso, na ɔhaw kɛse bi wɔ hɔ.
He would take the test.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ sɔhwɛ no.
But nothing went well.	Nanso biribiara ankɔ yiye.
He is the only boy in the room.	Ɔno nkutoo ne abarimaa a ɔwɔ dan no mu.
Thank you for everything.	Meda wo ase wɔ biribiara ho.
Once upon a time, a man was remarkably strong.	Bere bi, na ɔbarima bi ho yɛ den ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This is not surprising.	Eyi nyɛ nwonwa.
We could use him.	Ná yebetumi de no adi dwuma.
He hardly cared why.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na nea enti a ɛte saa no ho nhia no.
They have opportunities too.	Wɔn nso wɔ hokwan ahorow.

Nor should it be the case.	Saa ara nso na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
Hope you enjoy it!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho!.
And it was really good.	Na eye ankasa.
You can do it, too.	Wo nso wubetumi.
I don’t know how you can ever leave.	Minnim sɛnea wubetumi afi hɔ da bi.
His room was a beautiful prison.	Ná ne dan no yɛ afiase a ɛyɛ fɛ.
It’s not easy, folks.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw, nkurɔfo.
Great house with lots of space.	Ofie kɛse a ɛwɔ baabi pii.
But he has an idea.	Nanso ɔwɔ adwene bi.
I had something to say.	Ná mewɔ asɛm bi a mɛka.
No wonder he had no friends.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ na onni nnamfo biara.
Look at the two dogs.	Hwɛ kraman baanu no.
So does my mother.	Saa ara na me maame nso yɛ.
Here are some things that seem odd to me.	Nneɛma bi a ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ma me ni.
We all need that from time to time.	Yɛn nyinaa hia saa bere ne bere mu.
But it was an interesting idea.	Nanso na ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ anigye.
So, we had plenty of food to take home.	Enti, na yɛwɔ aduan pii a yɛde bɛkɔ fie.
He'll go.	Ɔbɛkɔ.
It’s the perfect size.	Ɛyɛ kɛse a edi mũ.
However, I can.	Nanso, metumi.
The animals are there.	Mmoa no wɔ hɔ.
A real job.	Adwuma ankasa.
That’s much easier and much more fun.	Ɛno yɛ mmerɛw kɛse na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
And here you have them.	Na ha na wowɔ wɔn.
But that wasn’t really what was going on here.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha no ankasa.
Let everyone sleep.	Ma obiara nna.
I couldn’t sleep.	Ná mintumi nna.
The only thing your child needs is time and interest.	Ade biako pɛ a wo ba hia ne bere ne anigye.
There are many cars.	Kar pii wɔ hɔ.
This is a squirrel.	Eyi yɛ ɔkraman.
Usually	Mpɛn pii no .
Maybe he will do it honestly.	Ebia ɔbɛyɛ no nokware mu.
We are a good team.	Yɛyɛ kuw pa.
I'm jealous of your name.	M'ani bere wo din no ho.
There is something for everyone here.	Biribi wɔ hɔ ma obiara wɔ ha.
He speaks three languages.	Ɔka kasa ahorow abiɛsa.
To me, every boy is the same.	Wɔ me fam no, abarimaa biara yɛ ade koro.
It happened a long time ago.	Esii bere tenten a atwam ni.
But it was not pleasant at all.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ anigye koraa.
He was kept in solitary confinement for several days.	Wɔde no too afiase a obiara nte mu nna pii.
Like, a lot of it.	Te sɛ, pii.
I don’t know anything about you.	Minnim wo ho hwee.
It must be something in the water.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ biribi a ɛwɔ nsu no mu.
Support should be reciprocal.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mmoa a wɔde ma no yɛ nea wɔde ma wɔn ho wɔn ho.
Nor was it really true.	Saa ara nso na na ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa.
We are equally unconvinced.	Yɛn nso yɛn adwene ntumi nnye yɛn adwene saa ara.
So be careful what you do.	Enti hwɛ yiye wɔ nea woyɛ no ho.
There is a boy here who looks like you.	Abarimaa bi wɔ ha a ɔte sɛ wo.
And you know it, too.	Na wo nso wunim.
He could hear himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa tumi te asɛm.
He is completely in control.	Ɔwɔ ne tumi mu koraa.
He does nothing for me.	Ɔnyɛ hwee mma me.
But my father, his mind, his mind .	Nanso me papa, n’adwene, n’adwene .
This is important to me.	Eyi ho hia me.
I know it’s in mine too.	Minim sɛ ɛwɔ me de mu nso.

A year ago it was.	Afe biako a atwam ni.
Hope you are doing great.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ woreyɛ kɛse.
That had to be the best thing about these days.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ ade a eye sen biara wɔ nna yi ho.
His addition was impeccable.	Ná nea ɔde kaa ho no yɛ nea mfomso biara nni ho.
Maybe I can get it started.	Ebia metumi ama afi ase.
I tell them the same thing every time.	Meka asɛm koro no ara kyerɛ wɔn bere biara.
That is certainly the case here.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛte saa wɔ ha.
I know that city.	Minim saa kurow no.
He showed all the pictures.	Ɔde mfonini ahorow no nyinaa kyerɛɛ.
It’s a matter of planning.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe ho asɛm.
This is me though.	Eyi ne me nanso.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Biribiara ntumi nkɔ akyiri sen nokware no.
He cared about people.	Ná nkurɔfo ho asɛm hia no.
No time for that now.	Bere biara nni hɔ mma ɛno mprempren.
It wasn’t pretty.	Ná ɛnyɛ fɛ.
You're doing well.	Woreyɛ yiye.
I hope you can save her.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi agye no nkwa.
And this is a job.	Na eyi yɛ adwuma.
The problem with that is obviously.	Ɔhaw a ɛwɔ ɛno ho ne sɛ ɛda adi sɛ.
But this was not for too long.	Nanso na eyi nyɛ bere tenten dodo.
I couldn’t figure out what he was doing.	Na mintumi nhu nea na ɔreyɛ no.
But this story seems to go too far.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea saa asɛm yi kɔ akyiri dodo.
If anything, it felt solid.	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, na ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ den.
It was a real danger to them.	Ná ɛyɛ asiane ankasa ma wɔn.
He was very large.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse paa.
It’s the ideal situation.	Ɛyɛ tebea a eye sen biara.
He didn't know what to say.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛka.
But fun and fun.	Nanso anigye ne anigye.
This was realistic.	Ná eyi yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Just start somewhere.	Fi ase wɔ baabi kɛkɛ.
There was someone else in the room.	Ná obi foforo nso wɔ dan no mu.
However, this presents another problem.	Nanso, eyi de ɔhaw foforo ba.
What wonderful things alcohol is.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara na ɛyɛ nsa.
Books are our friends.	Nhoma yɛ yɛn nnamfo.
We both had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛ saa.
It’s just a necessity.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛho hia ara kwa.
They were, once.	Na wɔyɛ, bere bi.
If you have to travel by car, be very careful.	Sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wode kar tu kwan a, hwɛ yiye paa.
This is true in their minds.	Eyi yɛ nokware wɔ wɔn adwene mu.
This was an interesting story.	Ná eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
Many of us thought that was wrong.	Yɛn mu pii susuwii sɛ ɛno yɛ mfomso.
Unless you want to.	Gye sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I can never do it.	Mintumi nyɛ no da.
And tell me again.	Na ka bio.
Again he says ‘it never matters’.	Bio nso ɔka sɛ ‘ɛnyɛ hwee da’.
I just wanted to know.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu ara kwa.
There is almost nothing to do.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
This is a fake name.	Eyi yɛ atoro din.
That means a lot.	Ɛno kyerɛ pii.
He did it in one way.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​wɔ ɔkwan biako so.
Little did I know it would.	Ná minnim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I have a lot of books here.	Mewɔ nhoma pii wɔ ha.
He thought he was something.	Ná osusuw sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
Everyone has something or someone they are worried about.	Obiara wɔ biribi anaa obi a ɔhaw no.
He himself was shocked at the situation.	Ɔno ankasa ho dwiriw no wɔ tebea no ho.
His mother is here.	Ne maame wɔ ha.
I found a really awesome project.	Mihuu adwuma bi a ɛyɛ hu ankasa.
We need to use less water.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde nsu kakraa bi na edi dwuma.
You just can’t say the same for them right now.	Worentumi nka saa ara mma wɔn mprempren ara kɛkɛ.
This will be a problem.	Eyi bɛyɛ ɔhaw.
This is my favorite time of year.	Eyi ne bere a m’ani gye ho paa wɔ afe no mu.
And it had been good.	Na na ayɛ papa.
But they were hardly awake.	Nanso na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔn ani nna.
There were many more.	Na pii wɔ hɔ.
It was things.	Ná ɛyɛ nneɛma.
I think that really tells the story.	Misusuw sɛ saa asɛm no ka asɛm no ankasa.
It’s a good job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma pa.
One last point.	Asɛm biako a etwa to.
I couldn’t take them inside.	Na mintumi mfa wɔn nkɔ mu.
It was quite simple, really.	Na ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa, ampa.
If so, it’s good.	Sɛ ɛte saa a, eye.
In real time.	Wɔ bere ankasa mu.
Whatever this was, it felt real.	Nea na eyi yɛ biara no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
I think my kids might enjoy this.	Misusuw sɛ ebia me mma ani begye eyi ho.
No one had ever done that before.	Ná obiara nyɛɛ no ​​saa da.
Everyone was out.	Ná obiara akɔ abɔnten.
In a real book.	Wɔ nhoma ankasa bi mu.
You can never know.	Worentumi nhu da.
I didn't want to do it now.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ mprempren.
I wasn’t interested in doing this.	Ná m’ani nnye ho sɛ mɛyɛ eyi.
In good order.	Wɔ nhyehyɛe pa mu.
The dog was fast.	Ná ɔkraman no tu mmirika ntɛmntɛm.
There is not much in it.	Nneɛma pii nni mu.
Anyone can see what it is.	Obiara betumi ahu nea ɛyɛ.
It felt like I had to.	Ɛte sɛ nea na ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
None of them said anything.	Wɔn mu biara anka hwee.
We put him there.	Yɛde no too hɔ.
It was scary again in a way.	Ná ɛyɛ hu bio wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
He does everything on time.	Ɔyɛ biribiara wɔ ne bere mu.
They are something people want.	Wɔyɛ biribi a nkurɔfo pɛ.
There are many people.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ.
Maybe many of them.	Ebia wɔn mu pii.
I hardly knew him.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na minnim no.
Now is the time to plan.	Mprempren ne bere a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nhyehyɛe.
What you think becomes you.	Nea wususuw ho no bɛyɛ wo.
So did I, too.	Saa ara na me nso.
He even wants to do that.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa mpo.
So that their situation can.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wɔn tebea no betumi.
The police have been extra careful.	Polisifo no ahwɛ yiye kɛse.
Maybe that has something to do with it.	Ebia ɛno ne no wɔ biribi yɛ.
However, that is just an opinion.	Nanso, ɛno yɛ adwene bi kɛkɛ.
For the time being.	Mprempren de.
There is no one in our room.	Obiara nni yɛn dan no mu.
The police started shooting.	Polisifo no fii ase too tuo.
Thanks again for your help!.	Meda wo ase bio wɔ wo mmoa ho!.
I nodded my head.	Mede me ti too fam.
He had a presence around him, too.	Na ɔwɔ baabi a ɔwɔ wɔ ne ho, nso.
That’s the point of the story.	Ɛno ne asɛm no mu nsɛm.
But maybe it’s not as hard as it sounds.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ den sɛnea ɛte no.
Maybe too often.	Ebia mpɛn pii dodo.
He loved the outdoors.	Ná n’ani gye abɔnten so nneɛma ho.
You have to work for him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma ma no.
He was quite young.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
The music was very loud.	Ná nnwom no ano yɛ den yiye.
Know that this is the time to give.	Hu sɛ eyi ne bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wode ma.
And he could be so wrong.	Na obetumi adi mfomso saa.
Every system checked.	Nhyehyɛe biara hwɛɛ mu.
Being connected to the two is very difficult.	Sɛ́ wobɛka abien no ho no yɛ den yiye.
That didn't seem so bad.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛno nyɛ bɔne saa.
He told me he was in his room.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ ɔwɔ ne dan mu.
He is always very happy.	Ɔwɔ anigye kɛse bere nyinaa.
This seems unlikely.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
So treat each day with them as if it might be your last.	Enti wo ne wɔn nyɛ da biara te sɛ nea ebia ɛbɛyɛ wo nea etwa to.
Know.	Nim.
This is not the way it should be.	Eyi nyɛ ɔkwan a ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
This is pretty amazing.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa yiye.
But they shouldn’t be.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Everyone has to leave.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara fi hɔ kɔ.

I’m thinking of it.	M’adwene yɛ.
You have to do what you have to do.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I knew he was planning to cause trouble.	Ná minim sɛ ɔreyɛ nhyehyɛe de ɔhaw aba.
This city used to be great.	Kan no na kurow yi yɛ kɛse.
There were a good number of them.	Ná wɔn dodow pa wɔ hɔ.
This is becoming amazing.	Eyi reyɛ nwonwa.
Moreover.	Ɛno akyi no.
There was nothing wrong with this.	Na mfomso biara nni eyi ho.
He wasn’t that kind of guy.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa su no.
It just seemed as dangerous as his intentions.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea asiane wom ara kwa sɛnea na n’adwene yɛ no.
That shot saved his life.	Saa tuo no gyee ne nkwa.
And we can even tell a story from it.	Na yebetumi mpo afi mu aka asɛm bi.
He knew how to do that a lot.	Ná onim sɛnea ɔbɛyɛ saa pii.
Where it was supposed to be.	Baabi a na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ.
I told him that it was all right.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛnyɛ asɛm koraa.
Lunch is on me.	Awia aduan wɔ me so.

No one goes anymore.	Obiara nkɔ bio.

It was a huge mistake.	Ná ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
We had some really good people there.	Ná yɛwɔ nnipa pa ankasa bi wɔ hɔ.
If the car is outside the door, he succeeds.	Sɛ kar no wɔ ɔpon no akyi a, odi yiye.
That seems really strange.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
And again and again and again.	Na mpɛn pii ne mpɛn pii.
Who lives in the house?	Hena na ɔte fie hɔ?
It was over for him and he knew it.	Na aba awiei ama no na na onim.
People just don’t think about it.	Nkurɔfo nsusuw ho kɛkɛ.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnte saa.
The police immediately responded to the scene.	Polisifo no yɛɛ ho biribi ntɛm ara wɔ baabi a asɛm no sii no.
If anything, they seemed interested.	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, na ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani gye ho.
They were really nice too.	Ná wɔn nso yɛ fɛ ankasa.
Who might do that.	Nea ebia ɔbɛyɛ saa.
This is obviously not the case.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nte saa.
It’s just as good.	Ɛyɛ papa saa ara.
He wanted some help from outside.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ mmoa bi fi abɔnten ba.

Remove all unnecessary items from your order.	Yi nneɛma a ɛho nhia nyinaa fi wo krataa no so.

However, the total amount is still somewhat complicated.	Nanso, sika dodow no nyinaa da so ara yɛ nea ɛyɛ den kakra.

Used by the user.	Nea ɔde di dwuma no na ɔde di dwuma.
But I didn’t know he was there.	Nanso na minnim sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ.
Besides, the money was there.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, na sika no wɔ hɔ.
There is a whole system here.	Nhyehyɛe mũ bi wɔ ha.
I immediately reach for my money.	Ntɛm ara na mede me nsa ka me sika.
He knew that would come later.	Ná onim sɛ ɛno bɛba akyiri yi.
They must be one and the same.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biako ne ade koro.
I just didn’t know.	Ná minnim kɛkɛ.
And it didn’t.	Na anyɛ saa.
I still couldn’t figure out what the thing was.	Na meda so ara ntumi nhu nea ade no yɛ.
You like its water.	W’ani gye ne nsu ho.
If he was in his room.	Sɛ na ɔwɔ ne dan mu a.
How beautiful it is.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Take them home.	Fa wɔn kɔ fie.
This statement shocked him.	Asɛm yi maa ne ho dwiriw no.
I have an idea.	Mewɔ adwene bi.
No one here is here.	Obiara nni ha a ɔwɔ ha.
That’s not your way at all.	Ɛno nyɛ wo kwan no koraa.
The same is true here.	Saa na ɛte wɔ ha nso.
He needed to think more about his plan.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ osusuw ne nhyehyɛe no ho kɛse.
Food for thought.	Aduan a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho.
You do what most people want to do.	Woyɛ nea nnipa dodow no ara pɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.

Problem is it’s not a new story.	Ɔhaw ne sɛ ɛnyɛ asɛm foforo.

Remind yourself how good you can be.	Kae wo ho sɛnea wubetumi ayɛ onipa pa.
The last time was about a week ago.	Bere a etwa to no yɛ bɛyɛ dapɛn biako a atwam ni.
I have something to tell you.	Mewɔ biribi a mɛka akyerɛ wo.
There were many of them.	Ná wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
But it was his language, in the end.	Nanso na ɛyɛ ne kasa, awiei koraa no.
However, her new shoes made her look great.	Nanso, ne mpaboa foforo no maa ne ho yɛɛ fɛ yiye.
We just have to keep our heads down.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde yɛn ti to fam kɛkɛ.
That shouldn’t surprise anyone.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ obiara nwonwa.
He hoped the meeting would be enjoyable.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ nhyiam no bɛyɛ anigye.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Mfomso biara nni eyi ho.
His name is.	Ne din de.
He will be great.	Ɔbɛyɛ kɛse.
Don’t talk about it.	Mma nka ho asɛm.
Lots of work.	Adwuma pii.
This arrangement is an interesting one.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
I don’t think you can play my music.	Minsusuw sɛ wubetumi abɔ me nnwom.
So it has been used in the past.	Enti wɔde adi dwuma wɔ bere a atwam no mu.
There is no one but me.	Obiara nni hɔ gye me.
It’s not just about the money.	Ɛnyɛ sika no nkutoo ho asɛm.
What you can actually give.	Nea wubetumi de ama ankasa.
He didn't have much to say.	Ná onni nsɛm pii a ɔbɛka.
Did I do good.	So meyɛɛ papa.
Every night will be the best.	Anadwo biara bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
They say this is a bad thing.	Wɔka sɛ eyi yɛ ade bɔne.
A few people were still watching the game.	Ná nnipa kakraa bi da so ara hwɛ agoru no.
The concept works for humans too.	Adwene no yɛ adwuma ma nnipa nso.
Her furniture, however, was not as good as his.	Nanso, na ne dan mu nneɛma nyɛ papa te sɛ ne de no.
Many of the articles are included.	Wɔde nsɛm no pii ahyɛ mu.
I wanted to, but I didn’t really know what that would look like.	Na mepɛ, nanso na minnim sɛnea ɛno bɛyɛ ankasa.
There is no group here.	Kuw biara nni ha.
As friends.	Sɛ́ nnamfo.
First, it doesn’t seem to be a problem at all.	Nea edi kan no, ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ ɔhaw biara koraa.
When was that the case.	Bere bɛn na na ɛte saa.
Clearly, there is truth in this view.	Ɛda adi sɛ nokware wɔ saa adwene yi mu.
I'm sure he has some very interesting things to tell me.	Migye di sɛ ɔwɔ nneɛma bi a ɛyɛ anigye yiye a ɔbɛka akyerɛ me.
Even if the project has absolutely nothing to say.	Sɛ mpo adwuma no nni hwee ka koraa a.
These problems caused a lot of concern	Saa ɔhaw ahorow yi maa nnipa pii haw wɔn ho
So, next week we will have two tests.	Enti, dapɛn a edi hɔ no yɛbɛyɛ sɔhwɛ abien.
This is all about what happened the other day.	Eyi nyinaa fa nea esii da bi no ho.
I didn’t want to do that.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
Not even one of them.	Ɛnyɛ biako mpo.
I did the same thing.	Meyɛɛ no ​​saa ara.
The drought was very severe.	Ná ɔpɛ bere no mu yɛ den yiye.
That’s how we become real people.	Saa na yɛbɛyɛ nnipa ankasa.
It’s like a meeting.	Ɛte sɛ nhyiam bi.
We are in the planning stage.	Yɛwɔ nhyehyɛe no fã a ɛwɔ nhyehyɛe no mu.
But be honest with yourself.	Nanso di wo ho nokware.
This was a terrible thing.	Na eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu.
Keep yourself warm.	Ma wo ho yɛ hyew.
I felt good about that.	Ná mete nka yiye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
He had a lot of money and nothing to do.	Ná ɔwɔ sika pii na na onni biribiara a ɔbɛyɛ.
The team needs to act quickly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ kuw no yɛ ade ntɛm.
This was something new, like prison.	Ná eyi yɛ ade foforo, te sɛ afiase.
The strangest thing happened yesterday.	Ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen biara no sii nnɛra.
He wants me to go out with him.	Ɔpɛ sɛ me ne no fi adi.
First you were mature.	Nea edi kan no na wo ho akokwaw.
There is a story behind every project.	Asɛm bi wɔ adwuma biara akyi.
It is not easy by any means.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
It is not the same as being.	Ɛnyɛ ade koro no ara ne sɛ obi yɛ.
You don’t need to know right now.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wuhu mprempren ara.
He can do both.	Obetumi ayɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa.
Maybe it does.	Ebia ɛyɛ saa.
And he had one.	Na ɔwɔ bi.
I’m not afraid of myself.	M’ani nnye me ho.
The test is difficult.	Sɔhwɛ no yɛ den.
No one told me that.	Obiara anka saa ankyerɛ me.
You, me, everyone here.	Wo, me, obiara a ɔwɔ ha.
And in this case.	Na wɔ eyi mu no.
When you invest in us, we invest in you.	Sɛ wode sika hyɛ yɛn mu a, yɛde sika hyɛ wo mu.
It’s not complicated at all.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den koraa.
But there is something else.	Nanso biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
It’s not just about you and what you want.	Ɛnyɛ wo ne nea wopɛ nkutoo ho asɛm.
And maybe the next day.	Na ebia da a edi hɔ no.
But it will do for two of us.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ yiye wɔ yɛn mu baanu fam.
We can go for it.	Yebetumi akɔ.
It certainly wasn’t one of ours.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛnyɛ yɛn de no mu biako.
It was obviously someone else.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛyɛ obi foforo.
All of this took time.	Eyi nyinaa gyee bere.
I half hope, and I want him to.	Mewɔ anidaso fã, na mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I thought about that a lot.	Misusuw saa asɛm no ho pii.
It’s the same thing in movies.	Ɛyɛ ade koro no ara wɔ sini ahorow mu.
They didn’t work either.	Wɔn nso anyɛ adwuma.
I like to go in completely sane.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛkɔ mu a m’adwene mu da hɔ koraa.
Not in this happy time.	Ɛnyɛ anigye bere yi mu.
Make it happen.	Ma ɛnyɛ yiye.
None of this is bad in any way.	Eyi mu biara nyɛ bɔne ɔkwan biara so.
That takes a little getting used to.	Ɛno gye sɛ obi yɛ ne su kakra.
You got to tell me something about something.	Wo nyaa kwan ka biribi ho asɛm bi kyerɛ me.
It’s actually pretty cool.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
As you should be doing.	Sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no.
I have to look into it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu.
I want it badly.	Mepɛ no bɔne.
His thoughts surprised him.	N’adwene a osusuw ho no maa ne ho dwiriw no.
She is absolutely beautiful.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ koraa.
It would have been too dangerous.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ nea asiane wom dodo.
A car is on its way.	Kar bi rekɔ kwan so.
You just remembered that you did.	Seesei ara na wokae sɛ woayɛ saa.
So this is a very, very important time.	Enti eyi yɛ bere a ɛho hia yiye paa.
It was a showcase for someone we admired.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a wɔde kyerɛ obi a yɛn ani gye ho.
She drives her kids to school.	Ɔde ne mma de kar kɔ sukuu.
It’s just as difficult.	Saa ara na ɛyɛ den.
The meeting was informal.	Ná nhyiam no nyɛ nhyehyɛe.
It was very difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den yiye.
Thrive.	Kɔ so.
I can take care of them.	Metumi ahwɛ wɔn.
You can be a boy.	Wubetumi ayɛ abarimaa.
I can’t keep doing this.	Mintumi nkɔ so nyɛ eyi.
He doesn’t seem to like me anymore, either.	Ɛte sɛ nea n’ani nnye me ho bio, nso.
Or, at any rate, it seemed to be one.	Anaasɛ, sɛnea ɛte biara no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ biako.
This method is false.	Saa kwan yi yɛ atoro.
Besides, that thing means nothing.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, saa ade no nkyerɛ hwee.
I saw one of them.	Mihuu wɔn mu biako.
Police are responding.	Polisifo reyɛ wɔn ade wɔ ho.
But that wasn’t happening here.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha.
I just wanted to make sure nothing went wrong.	Nea na mepɛ ara ne sɛ mehwɛ hu sɛ biribiara nkɔ yiye.
Many people are afraid of him.	Nnipa pii suro no.
Two hours from now.	Nnɔnhwerew abien fi mprempren.
It was a must-have.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Their mother.	Wo maame.
I don’t have any information.	Minni nsɛm biara.
He seems innocent enough.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne ho nni asɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
So many things.	Nneɛma pii saa.
There is nothing much better to do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a eye sen saa kɛse a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Hit my head on something.	Bɔ me ti wɔ biribi so.
Man, this was the kind of work you need to be in.	Onipa, na eyi ne adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ mu.
That’s my focus right now.	Ɛno ne m’adwene mprempren.
These floor beds come in many different styles.	Saa fam mpa yi wɔ ahorow ahorow pii.
It’s not pretty.	Ɛnyɛ fɛ.
He did that thing there.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ saa ade no wɔ hɔ.
Each of them took one.	Wɔn mu biara faa biako.
My hands felt numb.	Me nsa tee nka sɛ ayɛ mmerɛw.
The user can enter whatever they want.	Nea ɔde di dwuma no betumi de nea ɔpɛ biara ahyɛ mu.
And so they do.	Na saa na wɔyɛ.
I don’t know what he’s going to do.	Minnim nea ɔbɛyɛ.
As such, their work is critical.	Sɛnea ɛte no, wɔn adwuma no ho hia kɛse.
However, this is no longer available.	Nanso, eyi nni hɔ bio.
You can tell them here or not.	Wubetumi aka akyerɛ wɔn wɔ ha anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
We actually do something similar.	Yɛyɛ biribi a ɛte saa ara ankasa.
That’s part of what’s so amazing about it to me.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa kɛse wɔ ho ma me no fã.
The film will be a huge hit.	Sini no bɛma nkurɔfo ani agye ho kɛse.
He says it’s not what you think.	Ɔka sɛ ɛnyɛ sɛnea wususuw no.
It looks great outside.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye wɔ abɔnten.
You have a lot to offer us.	Wowɔ pii a wode bɛma yɛn.
And he wasn’t.	Na ɔno nso.
No one mentioned them.	Obiara anka wɔn ho asɛm.
Similarly, in chap.	Saa ara nso na wɔ ti.
This is no longer the case.	Eyi nte saa bio.
He too is lying on the ground.	Ɔno nso da fam.
He had his way with her.	Ná ɔne no wɔ ne kwan.
I hope you do too.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo nso wobɛyɛ saa.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia.
I already knew that too.	Ná me nso minim saa dedaw.
Never.	Da.
I still felt hopeful.	Ná meda so ara te anidaso nka.
Most of us like surprises.	Yɛn mu dodow no ara ani gye nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa ho.
Maybe easy maybe not.	Ebia ɛyɛ mmerɛw ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
Not that you can be dependent.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ wubetumi ayɛ obi a ɔde ne ho to so.
Get in the car.	Fa wo ho hyɛ kar no mu.
I don't know what's going on.	Minnim nea ɛrekɔ so.
He had a lot of help.	Ná ɔwɔ mmoa pii.
Do something fun that you enjoy.	Yɛ biribi a ɛyɛ anigye a w’ani gye ho.
The temporary permit is issued.	Wɔde bere tiaa mu tumi krataa no ma.
My dog ​​tends to end that quickly though.	Me kraman taa de saa ba awiei ntɛmntɛm nanso.
I didn’t care about the risk.	Ná asiane a ɛwɔ mu no mfa me ho.
People a little older have traveled a little further.	Nnipa a wɔn mfe akɔ anim kakra no atu kwan akɔ akyiri kakra.
No one can hear.	Obiara ntumi nte asɛm.
Approximately one month of use.	Bɛyɛ ɔsram biako a wɔde di dwuma.
We are in here.	Yɛwɔ ha mu.
And the next one, too.	Na nea edi hɔ no nso.
He had planned it well.	Ná wayɛ ho nhyehyɛe yiye.
All my money is still there.	Me sika nyinaa da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Finally, something good is happening!	Awiei koraa no, biribi pa bi rekɔ so!
He, unaware of the danger, said nothing.	Ɔno a na onnim asiane no anka hwee.
He had nothing to say, nothing to say.	Ná onni asɛm biara, na onni biribiara a ɔbɛka.
None of us said anything.	Yɛn mu biara anka hwee.
Evening had come quickly.	Ná anwummere aba ntɛmntɛm.
We all disagree with that!	Yɛn nyinaa ne saa adwene no nyɛ adwene!
But that’s the way it is.	Nanso saa na ɛte.
That was many years ago.	Ɛno yɛ mfe pii a atwam ni.
And here he is, too.	Na ɔno nso ni.
I still had two people left.	Ná meda so ara wɔ nnipa baanu a aka.
Success alone does not make people happy.	Odi mu nkutoo mma nkurɔfo ani nnye.
You are in my house.	Wowɔ me fie.
So long as people don’t work on it.	Enti bere tenten a nkurɔfo nyɛ ho adwuma no.
For them, this is the happiest time of the year.	Wɔ wɔn fam no, eyi ne bere a wɔn ani gye sen biara wɔ afe no mu.
Same as below.	Saa ara na ɛwɔ ase ha no.
You can get that much further with relative ease.	Wubetumi anya saa pii no akɔ akyiri a ɛnyɛ den koraa.
He stuck his head in it.	Ɔde ne ti hyɛɛ mu.
my father asked him.	me papa bisaa no.
He generally didn’t want to play.	Mpɛn pii no na ɔmpɛ sɛ odi agoru.
Thank you so much for dinner.	Meda wo ase pii wɔ anwummere aduan ho.
I have to sleep.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda.
He had to figure out what not to do.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ osusuw nea ɔnyɛ ho.
We are a force.	Yɛyɛ tumi.
What an interesting story.	Hwɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
Something or someone.	Biribi anaa obi.
But that approach never materialized.	Nanso saa kwan no amma mu da.
Get more hair off your head.	Fa nhwi pii fi wo ti so.
I have no one to help me.	Minni obi a ɔbɛboa me.
So home and in bed.	Enti fie ne mpa so.
He was in a strange situation.	Ná ɔwɔ tebea bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa mu.
He clenched his fists tightly.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ mu denneennen.
The back story was the same.	Ná akyi asɛm no yɛ ade koro.
Few are free.	Kakraa na wɔde ma kwa.
I don’t know about you, boy.	Minnim wo ho asɛm, abarimaa.
That will be very difficult.	Ɛno bɛyɛ den kɛse.
I can go with that.	Metumi de saa asɛm no akɔ.
Not that it is.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
The man was clear-headed.	Ná ɔbarima no adwene mu da hɔ.
This is not really true without this condition.	Eyi nyɛ nokware ankasa a tebea yi nka ho.
Back to back.	Akyi akyi.
So good in me.	Enti papa wɔ me mu.
Who knew you had so much.	Hena na na onim sɛ wowɔ pii saa.
These results are remarkable.	Nea afi mu aba yi yɛ nwonwa.
That’s not what this is.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea eyi yɛ.
He too had a good attitude.	Ná ɔno nso wɔ adwene pa.
The man had gone.	Na ɔbarima no akɔ.
I hope he can find a job soon.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ obetumi anya adwuma nnansa yi ara.
People can only handle so much.	Nneɛma pii nkutoo na nkurɔfo betumi adi ho dwuma.
I am here and you are there.	Mewɔ ha na wo nso wowɔ hɔ.
I got that right.	Me nsa kaa saa.
It was an important meeting for him.	Ná ɛyɛ nhyiam a ɛho hia ma no.
So time is short.	Enti bere yɛ tiaa.
I felt his feelings.	Metee ne nka.
Finally, I’ll be happy.	Awiei koraa no, m’ani begye.
Certainly not me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ me.
It’s always painful.	Ɛyɛ yaw bere nyinaa.
The walk will do you good.	Nantew no bɛyɛ wo yiye.
Remember that and always remember that.	Kae saa na kae saa bere nyinaa.
He had to do this quickly.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ eyi ntɛmntɛm.
Not like him.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔno.
It had to be that way.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
He can be a real thing.	Obetumi ayɛ ade ankasa.
However, this was not good.	Nanso, na eyi nyɛ papa.
I felt it had to be done.	Metee nka sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Another chapter available.	Ti foforo a ɛwɔ hɔ.
They are indeed dangerous.	Wɔyɛ asiane ampa.
You know how dangerous he is.	Wunim sɛnea ne ho yɛ hu.
But there is a price for my help.	Nanso bo bi wɔ hɔ ma me mmoa no.
There is just no way, no way.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ kɛkɛ, ɔkwan biara nni hɔ.
However, it is too late to tell him.	Nanso, aka akyi dodo sɛ mɛka akyerɛ no.
He put his foot firmly on the ground.	Ɔde ne nan sii fam denneennen.
I’m even interested in it.	M’ani gye ho mpo.
I put that down.	Mede saa asɛm no too fam.
You can leave here tomorrow.	Wubetumi afi ha ɔkyena.
But his mother did.	Nanso ne maame yɛɛ saa.
No doubt he was.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔyɛ saa.
Everyone had told her that her hair was the best.	Ná obiara aka akyerɛ no sɛ ne ti nhwi ne nea eye sen biara.
Maybe next time, too.	Ebia bere foforo nso.
We can do it our own way.	Yebetumi ayɛ no yɛn ankasa kwan so.
This is just how it is now.	Eyi ne sɛnea ɛte mprempren ara kwa.
What they do is very interesting.	Nea wɔyɛ no yɛ anigye kɛse.
Get back on the road.	San kɔ kwan no so.
Everybody uses everybody.	Obiara de obiara di dwuma.
This is not entirely true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
You are not doing very well today.	Wonyɛ yiye koraa nnɛ.
I understand now.	Mete ase mprempren.
The same is true of the same.	Saa ara na ɛte saa ara.
That was last month.	Ɛno yɛ ɔsram a etwaam no.
It doesn’t have to be you or me anymore.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo anaa me bio.
For a moment, part of the floor was under water.	Wɔ bere tiaa bi mu no, na fam no fã bi wɔ nsu ase.
I thought it was you.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ wo.
But here he is.	Nanso ɔno ni.
Even back home.	San kɔ fie mpo.
Currently, this game is the most popular.	Mprempren, saa agoru yi na nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse.
Just talk, you said.	Kasa kɛkɛ, wokae sɛ.
That would be a good thing.	Ɛno bɛyɛ ade pa.
The truth finally.	Nokware no awiei koraa.
He just hurt her.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​yaw ara kwa.
I can tell you it was a project.	Metumi aka akyerɛ wo sɛ na ɛyɛ adwuma bi.
I am sorry about that.	Ɛyɛ me yaw wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
But there was no one else in the car.	Nanso na obi foforo biara nni kar no mu.
It was an old car.	Ná ɛyɛ kar dedaw bi.
I actually made a plan to act.	Meyɛɛ nhyehyɛe bi ankasa sɛ mɛyɛ ade.
The issue is just the size.	Asɛm no ne ne kɛse ara kwa.
We can handle most situations, given time.	Yebetumi adi tebea dodow no ara ho dwuma, sɛ wɔde bere ama yɛn a.
Maybe no one knew.	Ebia na obiara nnim.
He himself had another problem.	Ná ɔno ankasa wɔ ɔhaw foforo.
There was little he could do.	Ná kakraa bi na obetumi ayɛ.
This wasn't going the way he wanted.	Ná eyi nkɔ sɛnea na ɔpɛ no.
It didn't matter what he told her.	Ná nea ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​no mfa ho.
It was what everyone thought.	Ná ɛyɛ nea obiara susuw.
In each case, everyone gives their opinion.	Wɔ asɛm biara mu no, obiara de n’adwene ma.
They just weren’t interested.	Ná wɔn ani nnye ho ara kwa.
I felt it first.	Metee nka kan.
It was cold this morning.	Ná awɔw wom anɔpa yi.
In front of me.	Wɔ anim ne me.
Or he from her.	Anaasɛ ɔno fi ne nkyɛn.
Apparently, it has.	Ɛda adi sɛ, ayɛ saa.
But that is for another time.	Nanso saa asɛm no fa bere foforo ho.
And that support had to be enormous.	Na na ɛsɛ sɛ saa mmoa no yɛ kɛse koraa.
But they do work.	Nanso wɔyɛ adwuma.
This would end the game.	Ná eyi bɛma agoru no aba awiei.
I am in really big trouble.	Mewɔ ɔhaw kɛse ankasa mu.
It may not be true.	Ebia ɛnyɛ nokware.
He pointed to the table.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ pon no so.
However, I doubt that was one of us.	Nanso, migye kyim sɛ na ɛno yɛ yɛn mu biako.
The atmosphere in that room was tense.	Ná tebea a ɛwɔ saa dan no mu no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
It will be a great day.	Ɛbɛyɛ da kɛse.
He is none of those things.	Ɔnyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara.
It seems to be the case, too.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa nso.
It’s more complicated than that.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den sen saa.
We got ourselves together.	Yɛn nsa kaa yɛn ho.
We are strong in our way.	Yɛyɛ den wɔ yɛn kwan so.
Beautiful truth, as the man said.	Nokware a ɛyɛ fɛ, sɛnea ɔbarima no kae no.
He had a first.	Ná ɔwɔ obi a odi kan.
This time I just didn’t like it.	Saa bere yi de na m’ani nnye ho kɛkɛ.
He hoped he was.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɔte saa.
You will feel better, you will feel better.	Wo ho bɛtɔ wo, wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
You say it yourself.	Wo ara woka no.
The dress is warm.	Atade no yɛ hyew.
There is absolutely no chance.	Hokwan biara nni hɔ koraa.
A few carry me on.	Kakraa bi de me kɔ so.
He didn't know what, if anything, to tell the man.	Ná onnim nea, sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, ɔbɛka akyerɛ ɔbarima no.
Try to use your hands as little as possible.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wode wo nsa bedi dwuma kakraa bi sɛnea wubetumi.
All the information is there.	Nsɛm no nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
The first is language.	Nea edi kan ne kasa.
They will give you whatever you want.	Wɔde nea wopɛ biara bɛma wo.
Only one person in the house will do that.	Onipa biako pɛ na ɔbɛyɛ saa wɔ fie hɔ.
That might be a problem.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ ɔhaw.
I had planned to be there for a year and a half.	Ná mayɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mɛkɔ hɔ afe ne fã.
He never slept the night with anyone.	Ná ɔne obiara nna anadwo no da.
But it’s not like a lot more complicated than that.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛ pii a ɛyɛ den sen saa.
They are very interested in it.	Wɔn ani gye ho kɛse.
The view remains blurry.	Adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ no da so ara yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
I’m so excited about this.	M’ani gye eyi ho kɛse.
The boy told his mother about his day.	Abarimaa no kaa ne da no ho asɛm kyerɛɛ ne maame.
So none of that for this year.	Enti ɛno mu biara nni hɔ mma afe yi.
The girl is very beautiful.	Abeawa no ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Except that it doesn’t.	Gye sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
Even if he was	Sɛ mpo na ɔyɛ .
That year.	Saa afe no.
The problem is that it doesn’t work.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma.
It’s your right.	Ɛyɛ wo hokwan.
There were not many people on the street.	Ná nnipa pii nni abɔnten so.
One thing he could do something with.	Ade biako a na obetumi de ayɛ biribi.
Look around the room.	Hwɛ dan no mu nyinaa.
I don’t know how he did that.	Me nnim sɛnea ɔyɛɛ saa.
You need to consider each person's circumstances.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw onipa biara tebea ho.
He wanted something else, he wanted something else.	Ná ɔpɛ biribi foforo, na ɔpɛ biribi foforo.
I guess he just didn’t know what to do.	Misusuw sɛ na onnim nea ɔnyɛ ara kwa.
He almost seemed happy.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
He had amazing hands.	Ná ɔwɔ nsa a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It is loud, fast and very unsightly.	Ɛyɛ den, ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm na ɛnyɛ fɛ yiye.
It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t great either.	Na ɛnyɛ bɔne, nanso na ɛnyɛ kɛse nso.
I was very interested in doing the same.	Ná m’ani gye ho yiye sɛ mɛyɛ saa ara.
Thank you for what you gave me.	Meda wo ase wɔ nea wode maa me no ho.
He and his son.	Ɔne ne ba no.
That’s why you absolutely have to give me that letter.	Ɛno nti na ɛsɛ sɛ wode saa krataa no ma me koraa no.
Everyone was afraid.	Ná obiara suro.
It might actually be that bad.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ bɔne saa ankasa.
Now I want to make one big point.	Seesei mepɛ sɛ meka asɛm kɛse biako.
It’s not a good movie.	Ɛnyɛ sini pa.
It was very cold.	Ná awɔw wom paa.
Maybe there are good things.	Ebia nneɛma pa wɔ hɔ.
We were very impressed with that.	Yɛn ani gyee saa asɛm no ho kɛse.
I knew about myself.	Ná minim me ho nsɛm.
She was my mother.	Ná ɔyɛ me maame.
You knew that up front.	Ná wunim saa wɔ anim.
The kids seemed happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea mmofra no ani agye.
Thank you so much again.	Meda wo ase pii bio.
Food is scarce here.	Aduan ho yɛ na wɔ ha.
That took hours and hours.	Ɛno gyee nnɔnhwerew ne nnɔnhwerew pii.
This is just it.	Eyi ara kwa.
His school books must have been in school.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ne sukuu nhoma ahorow no wɔ sukuu mu.
That was no longer possible.	Ná ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye bio.
I'll be fine overnight.	Me ho bɛtɔ me anadwo biako.
Imagine, we had his mom on the phone the whole time.	Fa no sɛ, na yɛwɔ ne maame wɔ telefon so bere no nyinaa.
Everyone is in danger.	Obiara wɔ asiane mu.
It was in his nature .	Ná ɛwɔ ne su mu .
He knew, even if he didn't.	Ná onim, sɛ onnim mpo a.
This problem has been worked on for years.	Wɔde mfe pii ayɛ ɔhaw yi ho adwuma.
That’s why you do that.	Ɛno nti na woyɛ saa no.
Mother recently.	Maame nnansa yi.
You will do it.	Wobɛyɛ.
Tell me what happened.	Ka nea asi no kyerɛ me.
Be there for a long time.	Wɔ hɔ bere tenten.
But here’s the problem.	Nanso ɔhaw no ni.
There was no money, by the way.	Na sika biara nni hɔ, ɔkwan bi so no.
To issue a document.	Sɛ wɔde krataa bi bɛma.
Use your power.	Fa wo tumi di dwuma.
He has no real friends.	Onni nnamfo ankasa biara.
Maybe you’ll do the same.	Ebia wobɛyɛ saa ara.
He is here with us in this room.	Ɔne yɛn wɔ ha wɔ saa dan yi mu.
They don’t like me.	Wɔn ani nnye me ho.
We need to innovate the city.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ kurow no mu nnwuma foforo.
This is a long time ago now.	Eyi yɛ bere tenten a atwam ni mprempren.
His letter was ragged.	Ná ne krataa no ayɛ mmerɛw.
After that it was easy.	Ɛno akyi no na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
These shoes cost a lot of money!	Saa mpaboa yi gye sika pii!
How strange that no one mentioned this at the party.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ obiara anka saa asɛm yi ho asɛm wɔ apontow no ase.
So, in a way, you’re right.	Enti, ɔkwan bi so no, woayɛ no yiye.
It’s not much harder that way.	Ɛnyɛ den pii saa kwan no so.
He just wants to work.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
So there are many factors.	Enti nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ.
They’re not here anymore.	Wɔn nni ha bio.
I do this at home.	Meyɛ eyi wɔ fie.
His father, a long time ago.	Ne papa, bere tenten a atwam ni.
Everyone there is normal.	Obiara a ɔwɔ hɔ no yɛ obi a ɔte ase.
You can always have three.	Wubetumi anya abiɛsa bere nyinaa.
I wanted to do well.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ yiye.
It was packed with people.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ mu ma.
I can't say why.	Mintumi nka nea enti a ɛte saa.
However, this is often not the case.	Nanso, mpɛn pii no, eyi nte saa.
Otherwise, you are in trouble.	Anyɛ saa a, wowɔ ɔhaw mu.
And maybe it wasn’t.	Na ebia na ɛnyɛ saa.
He and his wife homeschool their children.	Ɔne ne yere de wɔn mma kɔ sukuu wɔ fie.
Their work was fast.	Ná wɔn adwuma no yɛ ntɛmntɛm.
He lives in the city.	Ɔte kurow no mu.
You brought me back to life.	Wo na wode me baa nkwa mu bio.
The insignificant remained sluggish.	Nea ɛnyɛ hwee no kɔɔ so yɛɛ mmerɛw.
In the past month.	Wɔ ɔsram a atwam no mu.
A hot day.	Da a ɛyɛ hyew.
I can’t believe this.	Mintumi nnye eyi nni.
Sleep as late as possible.	Da akyiri sɛnea wubetumi biara.
You are so beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
He's about to do it.	Ɔreyɛ ayɛ no.
And make no mistake, that's what he looked like.	Na mma wo nni mfomso, saa na na ɔte.
You should do that when you can.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa bere a wubetumi.
This would cost money.	Ná eyi begye sika.
Two installations.	Nneɛma abien a wɔde sii hɔ.
Just make sure everything is within reach.	Hwɛ hu ara sɛ biribiara wɔ baabi a nsa betumi ayɛ.
You just want me happy.	Wopɛ me anigye kɛkɛ.
Any day now, he would give them his last words.	Da biara mprempren, na ɔde ne nsɛm a etwa to no bɛma wɔn.
I set aside time to focus to play with my friends.	Mede bere a mede m’adwene besi so no too nkyɛn sɛ me ne me nnamfo bedi agoru.
I think you’ll like it there.	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ho wɔ hɔ.
We should have done better.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ no yiye.
There should be jobs for the people.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nnwuma wɔ hɔ ma nkurɔfo no.
Rely on it for a while.	Fa wo ho to so kakra.
It seemed like everyone used to work in the same room.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea na obiara taa yɛ adwuma wɔ dan biako mu.
How did he get this job?	Ɔyɛɛ dɛn nyaa adwuma yi?
But this is clearly not the case.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ eyi nte saa.
He had no reason to be surprised.	Ná onni biribiara a enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no nwonwa.
Have fun while you can.	Gye w’ani bere a wubetumi no.
I couldn’t work.	Ná mintumi nyɛ adwuma.
She knew he had his eyes on her.	Ná onim sɛ n’ani wɔ ne so.
I had never thought of it that way.	Ná minsusuw ho saa da.
This task is not as easy as it sounds.	Saa adwuma yi nyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛte no.
In the letter.	Wɔ krataa no mu.
He is a very friendly person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔpɛ nnipa paa.
I think they offer an interesting variety.	Misusuw sɛ wɔde nneɛma ahorow a ɛyɛ anigye ma.
You can’t do anything.	Worentumi nyɛ biribi.
His head pounded violently.	Ne ti bɔɔ denneennen.
But look how this plays out.	Nanso hwɛ sɛnea eyi di agoru no.
It was up to me.	Ná ɛda me so.
All good things must come to an end.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma pa nyinaa ba awiei.
Some of his friends didn’t.	Ne nnamfo no bi anyɛ saa.
It was some kind of party or something.	Ná ɛyɛ apontow bi anaa biribi a ɛte saa.
That’s how money worked.	Saa na na sika yɛ adwuma.
But that wasn’t true.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ nokware.
Just like anything you want.	Te sɛ biribiara a wopɛ ara pɛ.
He was on the floor.	Ná ɔwɔ fam hɔ.
He was thrilled with that.	N’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho.
That doesn’t make it better or worse.	Ɛno mma ɛnyɛ papa anaasɛ ɛnyɛ bɔne.
They are the ones who do it.	Wɔn na wɔyɛ saa.
What, if anything, is wrong?	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, dɛn na ɛyɛ bɔne?
That’s when .	Ɛno ne bere a .
Nothing else is included.	Nneɛma foforo biara nka ho.
One way or the other.	Ɔkwan biako anaa ɔkwan foforo so.
Obviously, the inside.	Ɛda adi sɛ, nea ɛwɔ mu no.
Here is an old picture of the same.	Ɛno ara ho mfonini dedaw bi ni.
Beware of counterfeit money.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ sika a ɛnyɛ nokware ho.
It’s smart about you.	Ɛyɛ nyansa wɔ wo ho.
And the gun, too.	Na tuo no nso.
Take care of them.	Hwɛ wɔn yiye.
But it’s not too late.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea aka akyi dodo.
Without water there is no life.	Sɛ nsu nni hɔ a, nkwa nni hɔ.
However, that was not to be the plan at all.	Nanso, na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ nhyehyɛe no koraa.
Walk to work.	Nantew kɔ adwuma.
He knew there was something strange about it all.	Ná onim sɛ biribi yɛ nwonwa wɔ ne nyinaa mu.
Maybe we should all do that.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa yɛ saa.
You're the one.	Wo ni.
The city had something for everyone.	Ná kurow no wɔ biribi a obiara ani gye ho.
There is no more mistake.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ bio.
And the only reason why.	Na ade biako pɛ nti a ɛte saa.
It wasn’t a big deal.	Ná ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse.
For the rest of the time do whatever you want.	Wɔ bere a aka no mu no yɛ nea wopɛ biara.
And it’s just kind of it.	Na ɛyɛ ɔkwan bi so ara kwa.
Now there is a problem.	Seesei ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
I have no idea where we are.	Minni baabi a yɛwɔ ho adwene biara.
As it may indeed be.	Sɛnea ebia ɛbɛyɛ ampa no.
And he was great, too.	Na ɔno nso yɛ kɛse.
It’s much better now.	Ɛyɛ papa kɛse mprempren.
It’s like a lot of money.	Ɛte sɛ sika pii.
Now there is no time.	Seesei bere nni hɔ.
This was our personal favorite.	Ná eyi ne nea yɛn ankasa ani gye ho kɛse.
I love my house.	M’ani gye me fie ho.
I have to go soon.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ ntɛm.
The people are still there.	Nkurɔfo no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
You can really follow what’s going on inside them.	Wubetumi adi nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ wɔn mu no akyi ankasa.
Or maybe they are completely independent.	Anaasɛ ebia wɔde wɔn ho koraa.
That opportunity had come.	Ná saa hokwan no aba.
I hope everyone had a great weekend.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ obiara nyaa dapɛn awiei kɛse.
He was busy making final arrangements.	Ná onni adagyew sɛ ɔbɛyɛ nhyehyɛe a etwa to.
A very pretty girl.	Abeawa bi a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
And his old room.	Na ne dan dedaw no nso.
It wasn’t surprising at all, whatever people might say.	Na ɛnyɛ nwonwa koraa, nea nkurɔfo bɛka biara.
But I think this approach makes it really easy.	Nanso misusuw sɛ saa kwan yi ma ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
It seemed so real.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware paa.
As you can see, this is a great house.	Sɛnea wubetumi ahu no, eyi yɛ ofie kɛse bi.
However, it is not fast enough.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ntɛmntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
The group is awesome.	Kuw no yɛ hu.
He’s the same.	Ɔno ara.
It was such a great document.	Ná ɛyɛ krataa kɛse a ɛte saa.
That is their right.	Ɛno ne wɔn hokwan.
There is much work to be done.	Adwuma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
And this is for a great reason.	Na eyi yɛ ade kɛse nti.
This house is very popular.	Saa ofie yi yɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse.
I was no longer there.	Ná me nni hɔ bio.
Eat.	Di.
However, it might be.	Nanso, ebia na ɛbɛyɛ saa.
There was a severe water shortage.	Ná nsu ho ayɛ na kɛse.
He was a tall man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima tenten.
That is the risk we have to take.	Ɛno ne asiane a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde yɛn ho to so.
What can we do about this?	Dɛn na yebetumi ayɛ wɔ eyi ho?
Maybe you’ll be interested.	Ebia w’ani begye ho.
It was still alive.	Ná ɛda so ara te ase.
Our music is just our music.	Yɛn nnwom yɛ yɛn nnwom ara kwa.
Look inside, no one, nothing.	Hwɛ mu, obiara nni hɔ, biribiara nni hɔ.
I have no idea how it works.	Minnim sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma no ho adwene biara.
I want you everything.	Mepɛ wo biribiara.
He wanted to do it himself.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa yɛ.
I know things.	Minim nneɛma.
But it was incredibly fun in a short amount of time.	Nanso na ɛyɛ anigye a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
We hung out for a good part of that day.	Yɛde yɛn ho bɔɔ ho saa da no fã pa.
It has been in this state for a long time.	Ɛwɔ saa tebea yi mu bere tenten.
It was impressive enough.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He is a strong and strong man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ den na ɔyɛ den.
It’s actually pretty amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye ankasa.
Animals seemed to sense that something terrible was happening.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea mmoa te nka sɛ biribi a ɛyɛ hu rekɔ so.
He loved it here.	Ná n’ani gye ho wɔ ha.
I'm not sure what to do.	Me deɛ, me deɛ, me deɛ.
Hair is common here.	Ti nhwi abu so wɔ ha.
You really like this and want more.	W’ani gye eyi ho ankasa na wopɛ pii.
It was loaded.	Ná wɔde nneɛma ahyɛ mu.
I’m kind of happy.	M’ani gye ɔkwan bɛn so.
Testing will be easy.	Sɔhwɛ bɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Glad to have you both.	Anigye sɛ yɛwɔ mo baanu nyinaa.
They are amazing.	Wɔyɛ nwonwa.
This can have many different consequences.	Eyi betumi de nneɛma ahorow pii aba.
He knew her better than she knew herself.	Ná onim no yiye sen sɛnea na ɔno ankasa nim no.
I’m happy if there’s interest.	M’ani gye sɛ anigye wɔ hɔ a.
And you want what he wants.	Na wopɛ nea ɔpɛ.
I had food.	Ná mewɔ aduan.
He knows.	Onim.
It might be expensive.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nea ne bo bɛyɛ den.
He's pretty passive these days.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔnyɛ hwee koraa nnansa yi.
And there may have been more.	Na ebia na pii wɔ hɔ.
He’s not that tall.	Ɔnyɛ tenten saa.
It is very expensive.	Ɛyɛ nea ne bo yɛ den yiye.
We have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
He seemed to know everyone.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onim obiara.
At least one time.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, bere biako.
That was painful, too.	Ɛno nso yɛɛ yaw.
I was late for school.	Ná meka akyi wɔ sukuu mu.
We, you and I.	Yɛn, wo ne me.
A thought struck him.	Adwene bi kaa no.
He describes what happened.	Ɔka nea esii no ho asɛm.
That was a simple idea.	Ná ɛno yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
They had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
But something strange had indeed happened.	Nanso na biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa asi ampa.
Maybe he didn’t like the problems.	Ebia na n’ani nnye ɔhaw ahorow no ho.
I am a human being.	Meyɛ onipa.
However, the road is never completely empty.	Nanso, ɔkwan no so nni hwee koraa da.
It was two other people.	Ná ɛyɛ nnipa baanu foforo.
You are important.	Wo ho hia.
Everyone knows him there.	Obiara nim no wɔ hɔ.
Children do that often.	Mmofra yɛ saa mpɛn pii.
He knows he is not alone.	Onim sɛ ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
I can’t understand this.	Mintumi nte eyi ase.
There was nothing remarkable about it.	Ná biribiara nni mu a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He didn’t like me.	Ná n’ani nnye me ho.
That could be the case.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ saa.
You don’t have to do anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribiara.
What a wonderful thing.	Ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni.
He had one when he was a kid.	Ná ɔwɔ bi bere a na ɔyɛ abofra no.
But that doesn’t matter much.	Nanso ɛno ho nhia pii.
I thought so too.	Me nso misusuwii saa.
But the general consensus is.	Nanso adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa ne sɛ.
However, it was something interesting.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ anigye.
And it doesn’t need it.	Na enhia no.
This seems too weak an ending.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ awiei a ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
Humans can also live in water.	Nnipa nso tumi tra nsu mu.
It wasn’t my test.	Ná ɛnyɛ me sɔhwɛ.
It seemed too simple.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
You have to provide both.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode abien no nyinaa ma.
Trust me, it’s not as easy as it sounds.	Gye me di, ɛnyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛte no.
We’re right there.	Yɛwɔ hɔ ara.
I really love my bed.	M’ani gye me mpa ho ankasa.
I wanted the whole movie to be like that.	Ná mepɛ sɛ sini no nyinaa yɛ saa.
No one knew how to deal with him.	Ná obiara nnim sɛnea ɔne no bedi.
It’s one bad shot.	Ɛyɛ tuo bɔne biako.
Children have many friends.	Mmofra wɔ nnamfo pii.
How much time is left.	Bere dodow a aka ahe na aka.
Give them nothing, not anything.	Mma wɔn biribi, ɛnyɛ ade biara.
I still believe that was a mistake.	Meda so ara gye di sɛ na ɛno yɛ mfomso.
The classroom was warm.	Ná sukuu dan no mu yɛ hyew.
It’s just commonplace.	Ɛyɛ nea abu so ara kwa.
This worked extremely well.	Eyi yɛɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
But on the other hand, they are the same.	Nanso ɔkwan foforo so no, wɔyɛ ade koro.
Our city needs a new movie.	Yɛn kurow no hia sini foforo.
There is only one problem.	Ɔhaw biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
In that city.	Wɔ saa kurow no mu.
We cannot see that it is definitely not good.	Yɛrentumi nhu sɛ akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ papa.
But that boy came along and so would he.	Nanso saa abarimaa no baa hɔ na ɔno nso bɛyɛ saa ara.
Throughout the year, things went on.	Wɔ afe no mu nyinaa no, nneɛma kɔɔ so.
Work on the kids.	Yɛ mmofra no ho adwuma.
He put me here.	Ɔde me too ha.
And even then.	Na saa bere no mpo.
I did a good job too.	Me nso meyɛɛ adwuma pa.
Will you come with me?	Wo ne me bɛba?
He had a name.	Ná ɔwɔ din bi.
That happened in this case.	Ɛno sii wɔ asɛm yi mu.
How soon can you leave?	Ntɛm ahe na wubetumi afi hɔ?
Look at the pictures.	Hwɛ mfonini ahorow no.
But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ ɛho nhia.
However, this is often not the case.	Nanso, mpɛn pii no, eyi nte saa.
Without a doubt, it is dangerous.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ asiane wom.
So again, go and win!	Enti bio, kɔ na di nkonim!
It looks great on paper.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye wɔ krataa so.
Police took the boy into custody.	Polisifo de abarimaa no too afiase.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnte saa.
He signed this picture for her.	Ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ mfonini yi ase maa no.
But this need not be the case.	Nanso ɛho nhia sɛ eyi yɛ saa.
Tomorrow is the big day.	Ɔkyena ne da kɛse no.
The street was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ abɔnten so ma.
He became a housewife.	Ɔyɛɛ obi a ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ofie.
That is not the point of this article.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm yi mu asɛm.
I liked his comments.	M’ani gyee ne nsɛm no ho.
Or just so we can wear it.	Anaasɛ sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a yebetumi ahyɛ no ara kwa.
But he was	Nanso na ɔyɛ .
Please just get to know me.	Mesrɛ wo hu me ara kwa.
That guy shot him like crazy.	Saa ɔbarima no too no tuo te sɛ kraman.
That’s all there is to it.	Ɛno ara ne no.
I know what the truth is.	Minim nea nokware no yɛ.
It’s in me.	Ɛwɔ me mu.
We were deeply moved by what happened.	Nea esii no kaa yɛn kɛse.
You have to do it all.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ne nyinaa.
There was a problem.	Ná ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
And so we trusted ourselves.	Na enti yɛde yɛn ho too yɛn ho so.
I know how bad it is now.	Minim sɛnea ɛyɛ bɔne mprempren.
You just have to get used to it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wo su ara kwa.
That was him, too.	Ná ɛno nso ne ɔno.
Everything else has to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribiara a aka no kɔ.
The night was cold.	Ná awɔw wom anadwo no.
Just a year ago.	Afe biako pɛ a atwam ni.
Here are some of the results.	Nea afi mu aba no bi ni.
You can be whoever you can be.	Wubetumi ayɛ obiara a wubetumi ayɛ.
He wanted this.	Ná ɔpɛ eyi.
For him, anyway.	Wɔ ne fam no, ɔkwan biara so.
A terrible, terrible idea.	Adwene a ɛyɛ hu a ɛyɛ hu.
All these things are new.	Saa nneɛma yi nyinaa yɛ foforo.
I think you’ll like him too.	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ne ho nso.
A really great thing.	Ade kɛse ankasa.
However, I didn't know how to use it.	Nanso, na minnim sɛnea wode bedi dwuma no.
Or better yet, watch the entire season.	Anaasɛ nea eye sen saa no, hwɛ bere no nyinaa.
You can make any image you want.	Wubetumi ayɛ mfonini biara a wopɛ.
I probably was at the time too.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na me nso meyɛ saa saa bere no.
Life is expensive.	Nkwa bo yɛ den.
Things were going well, except.	Ná nneɛma rekɔ yiye, gye sɛ.
Everyone needs a car today!	Obiara hia kar nnɛ!
It was the end of an era.	Ná ɛyɛ bere bi awiei.
That cost as much as our first bed.	Ɛno bo yɛ den te sɛ yɛn mpa a edi kan no.
There is definitely a lot to think about.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
I just don’t know what it is.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ kɛkɛ.
This was a good job.	Eyi yɛɛ adwuma pa.
Look into this and this and this and this.	Hwɛ eyi ne eyi ne eyi ne eyi mu.
This car is too strong.	Saa kar yi mu yɛ den dodo.
We just do them in the same room.	Yɛyɛ wɔn wɔ dan koro mu ara kwa.
Remember, all sins are forgiven.	Kae sɛ wɔde bɔne nyinaa akyɛ.
His right was there.	Na hokwan a ɔwɔ no wɔ hɔ.
It’s all happened.	Ne nyinaa asi.
So our monster or monster is in him.	Enti yɛn aboa kɛse no anaa aboa kɛse no wɔ ne mu.
He knew the car.	Ná onim kar no.
All the details are fascinating.	Nsɛm no nyinaa yɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
Our team is pretty cool.	Yɛn kuw no yɛ fɛ yiye.
This book was perfect.	Ná nhoma yi yɛ pɛ.
I’m interested in that.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
It must have been incredibly scary.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ hu a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This was all years ago for me.	Ná eyi nyinaa yɛ mfe a atwam ma me.
Just as he liked it.	Sɛnea n’ani gyee ho no ara pɛ.
Or don’t believe it.	Anaasɛ nnye nni.
The accident happened on the outskirts of town.	Akwanhyia no sii wɔ kurow no akyi.
For most of them this is because	Wɔ wɔn mu dodow no ara fam no eyi fi .
I have a job for you.	Mewɔ adwuma bi ma wo.
It’s much easier that way.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse saa kwan no so.

He's getting better all the time.	Ɔreyɛ papa bere nyinaa.
He had nothing to say.	Ná onni asɛm biara a ɔbɛka.
But it’s something.	Nanso ɛyɛ biribi.
Can you help me with my homework?	So wubetumi aboa me wɔ me fie nnwuma ho?
And he does that.	Na ɔyɛ saa.
We can deal with that.	Yebetumi adi saa asɛm no ho dwuma.

This is all there is to it.	Eyi ara na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Everyone can make mistakes.	Obiara betumi adi mfomso.
Take a real look at yourself.	Hwɛ wo ho ankasa.
We can come here.	Yebetumi aba ha.
But we do what we do.	Nanso yɛyɛ nea yɛyɛ.
It shouldn’t be that way.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I think that was the case.	Misusuw sɛ saa na na ɛte.
But it seems to be a lie.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ atoro.
There was still too much in the house, too empty.	Ná ɛda so ara wɔ fie hɔ dodo, na na hwee nni mu dodo.
It’s one of those things.	Ɛyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biako.
That was an idea.	Ná ɛno yɛ adwene bi.
There wasn’t much going on.	Ná ɛnyɛ pii na ɛrekɔ so.
Nothing.	Hwee.
You have made us a bad house.	Woayɛ yɛn dan bɔne.
You want to do it more often.	Wopɛ sɛ woyɛ no mpɛn pii.
They must be brought.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde ba.
The animal's mother was nearby.	Ná aboa no maame bɛn hɔ.
The floor bed is on the floor.	Fam mpa no wɔ fam.
But it’s really under the gun.	Nanso ɛwɔ tuo no ase ankasa.
This was so beautiful.	Ná eyi yɛ fɛ yiye.
Colder days are usually followed by warmer days.	Nna a awɔw wom no taa di nna a ɛyɛ hyew akyi.
Like a normal girl.	Te sɛ abeawa a ɔte ase.
This can go on for hours into the present.	Eyi betumi akɔ so nnɔnhwerew pii de besi nnɛ.
So it was a surprise.	Enti na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
These people want nothing from him.	Saa nkurɔfo yi mpɛ hwee mfi ne hɔ.
He shouldn’t have done that.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
The day after tomorrow.	Da a edi ɔkyena akyi.
And that’s only half the problem.	Na ɛno yɛ ɔhaw no fã pɛ.
There was nothing more he could do about it, really.	Biribiara nni hɔ bio a na obetumi ayɛ wɔ ho, ampa.
That worked for me at the time.	Ɛno yɛɛ adwuma maa me saa bere no.
You have a squirrel.	Wowɔ ɔkraman.
I have a lot of very important work in the morning.	Mewɔ adwuma pii a ɛho hia yiye anɔpa.
There are some interesting things happening here.	Nneɛma bi a ɛyɛ anigye rekɔ so wɔ ha.
People still want to do something.	Nkurɔfo da so ara pɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi.
It felt really real.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware ankasa.
Inside you go.	Wɔ wo mu kɔ.
After that man.	Saa ɔbarima no akyi.
He could put half of each foot on what he thought.	Ná obetumi de ne nan biara fã ahyɛ nea na osusuw no so.
Knowing it wasn’t ideal wasn’t good enough.	Ná nim a minim sɛ ɛnyɛ nea eye sen biara no nyɛ papa.
Now and then and now, its really here.	Mprempren ne mprempren ne mprempren, nea ɛwɔ ha ankasa.
It was too late for me.	Ná aka akyi dodo ama me.
Hardly anyone goes to jail, anymore.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara nkɔ afiase, bio.
There are still many mistakes.	Mfomso pii da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Sure.	Gye di.
He had some of it.	Ná ɔwɔ bi.
Bad mistakes mistakes.	Mfomso bɔne mfomso.
And it’s still amazing today.	Na ɛda so ara yɛ nwonwa nnɛ.
Finally it does me something.	Awiei koraa no ɛyɛ me biribi.
He nodded his head.	Ɔde ne ti too fam.
I still talk to myself.	Meda so ara ne me ho kasa.
Like he didn’t want to say it.	Te sɛ nea na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka.
One day the police may come.	Da bi polisifo betumi aba.
He wants to stay here in his house with his mother.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne ne maame tra ne fie ha.
It was nothing , really.	Na ɛnyɛ hwee , ankasa.
It was like a movie set.	Ná ɛte sɛ sini a wɔde asi hɔ.
So even that is a good thing.	Enti ɛno mpo yɛ ade pa.
But there is almost nothing we can do.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ.
But not now, not so much.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mprempren, ɛnyɛ saa.
But that was never his way.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ ne kwan da.
I posted a new picture from today.	Mede mfonini foforo hyɛɛ mu fi nnɛ.
Or, you know, really quickly.	Anaasɛ, wunim, ntɛm ankasa.
I’m so excited about this.	M’ani gye eyi ho kɛse.
You have to trust me on that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye me di wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Just not yet.	Ɛnyɛ de besi nnɛ ara kwa.
Think about it, if you can.	Susuw ho, sɛ wubetumi a.
You can’t believe what he says.	Worentumi nnye nea ɔka no nni.
Think about how smart it is, really.	Susuw sɛnea ɛyɛ nyansa no ho, ankasa.
The meaning of ‘extra’ is unclear.	Nea ‘aka ho’ kyerɛ no mu nna hɔ.
Be careful with that.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
When he was doing some work.	Bere a na ɔyɛ adwuma bi no.
But maybe it was enough.	Nanso ebia na ɛdɔɔso.
I don’t like to talk about him anyway.	M’ani nnye ho sɛ mɛka ne ho asɛm ɔkwan biara so.
That was also a false statement.	Ná ɛno nso yɛ atoro asɛm.
Children are innocent.	Mmofra ho nni asɛm.
When it does, it reveals a new situation.	Bere a ɛyɛ saa no, ɛda tebea foforo bi adi.
No one had anything so beautiful.	Ná obiara nni hɔ a na ɔwɔ biribi a ɛyɛ fɛ saa.
He just plays with everything.	Ɔde biribiara a ɛwɔ hɔ di agoru ara kwa.
But a dog is not a man.	Nanso ɔkraman nyɛ onipa.
There is no big deal.	Ade kɛse biara nni hɔ.
I’m not sure.	M’ani nnye ho.
Everyone wants all of that.	Obiara pɛ saa nneɛma no nyinaa.
So you have to trust me.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho to me so.
I wish you were here.	Me yam a anka wowɔ ha.
Animals are like that.	Mmoa te saa.
Your wife is gone.	Wo yere nni hɔ bio.
The numbers kept growing.	Dodow no kɔɔ so yɛɛ kɛse.
In showing his head.	Wɔ ne ti a wɔde kyerɛ no mu.
This movie has nothing to do with me, or my song.	Saa sini yi ne me, anaa me dwom no nni hwee yɛ.
He wanted to do everything.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribiara.
Humans had done the same.	Ná nnipa nso ayɛ saa.
Water is the source of all life.	Nsu ne ade a nkwa nyinaa fi mu.
And it was amazing.	Na na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
His condition is very serious.	Ne tebea no mu yɛ den yiye.
We spend most of our time at home.	Yɛde yɛn bere fã kɛse no ara tra fie.
Not one group.	Ɛnyɛ kuw biako.
I hadn’t thought this through.	Ná minsusuw eyi ho yiye.
It’s not my business.	Ɛnyɛ me asɛm.
I'm sorry about everything.	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ biribiara ho.
In a way, it might have been better.	Ɔkwan bi so no, ebia na eye sen saa.
This was really too easy.	Ná eyi yɛ mmerɛw dodo ankasa.
I have to tell him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no.
It didn’t matter to me.	Ná ɛnyɛ hwee mma me.
Much longer than that.	Pii tenten sen saa.
He had a point about this.	Ná ɔwɔ asɛm bi a ɔka wɔ eyi ho.
A year had passed.	Ná afe biako atwam.
It’s not that easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
What a terrible idea.	Hwɛ sɛnea adwene a ɛyɛ hu.
You made it a habit.	Wode yɛɛ ne su.
Look at his hair.	Hwɛ ne ti nhwi.
That was a complete mistake.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfomso koraa.
I couldn’t afford to do it.	Na mintumi nnya kwan nyɛ.
Give it a shot though.	Ma no tuo nanso.
It was very easy to use.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma.
Many people believe in him.	Nnipa pii gye no di.
This was no longer his room.	Ná eyi nyɛ ne dan bio.
I think this will be a great game.	Misusuw sɛ eyi bɛyɛ agoru kɛse.
Everyone has the right to use it.	Obiara wɔ ho kwan sɛ ɔde di dwuma.
He wanted to hear it too.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte nso.
We were all sitting there.	Ná yɛn nyinaa te hɔ.
This was very easy.	Ná eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
It should be pretty nice.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I think it’s true.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
That song is one of my father’s favorites.	Saa dwom no yɛ nnwom a me papa ani gye ho paa no mu biako.
That danger is terrible.	Saa asiane no yɛ hu.
It’s very complicated.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den yiye.
My intelligence is not perfect.	Me nyansa nyɛ pɛ.
This is an important point.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛho hia.
Has anyone seen him?	So obi ahu no?
Again, check it out.	Bio nso, hwɛ mu.
One can do this for a little longer.	Obi betumi ayɛ eyi bere tenten kakra.
He slammed his hand on the table.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ pon no so.
But often things are not what they seem.	Nanso mpɛn pii no nneɛma nyɛ nea ɛte sɛ nea ɛte no.
That’s a surprise.	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
There was another man.	Ná ɔbarima foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
But he was a good man.	Nanso na ɔyɛ onipa pa.
It didn’t matter to me.	Ná ɛnyɛ me asɛm.
See, there was an article just the other day.	Hwɛ, na asɛm bi wɔ hɔ da a atwam no ara.
Don’t tell anyone what’s really going on.	Nka nea ɛrekɔ so ankasa nkyerɛ obiara.
He does this for everyone.	Ɔyɛ eyi ma obiara.
It works for me!.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ma me!.
This isn’t the same.	Eyi nte saa ara.
But there is something else.	Nanso biribi foforo wɔ hɔ.
But this house has nothing wrong with it.	Nanso ofie yi nni mfomso biara wɔ ho.
It was fresh and new.	Ná ɛyɛ foforo na ɛyɛ foforo.
Besides, he's a little sore this morning.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, ne ho ayɛ no yaw kakra anɔpa yi.
But there was no other option.	Nanso na ɔkwan foforo biara nni hɔ.
You only get one chance.	Wo nsa ka hokwan biako pɛ.
Without any danger to them.	A asiane biara nni wɔn ho.
It’s hard to tell.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka.
But not today.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nnɛ.
He knows you are always thinking.	Onim sɛ wususuw nneɛma ho bere nyinaa.
Everyone knows what it’s like.	Obiara nim sɛnea ɛte.
I feel very surprised.	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ me nwonwa kɛse.
Not everyone does that.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na ɔyɛ saa.
My father worked all his life.	Me papa yɛɛ adwuma ne nkwa nna nyinaa.
Children love it.	Mmofra ani gye ho.
That’s what you do.	Ɛno ne nea woyɛ.
However, that is an opinion.	Nanso, ɛno yɛ adwene.
Now you are a man.	Seesei woyɛ ɔbarima.
There is no such opportunity.	Hokwan biara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
He moves things from one place to another.	Ɔde nneɛma fi baabi kɔ baabi foforo.
He shakes his head.	Ɔbɔ ne ti.
One of his shoes is missing.	Ne mpaboa biako nni hɔ.
He doesn’t even know about my apartment.	Onnim me dan no ho asɛm mpo.
However, it has occurred to me that many do not.	Nanso, aba m’adwene mu sɛ pii nyɛ saa.
It was painful for him.	Ná ɛyɛ yaw no.
Just last year, that was the case.	Afe a etwaam no ara mu no, na ɛte saa.
They are fun!	Wɔyɛ anigye!
The rest doesn’t matter.	Nea aka no mfa ho.
We can go for lunch or dinner sometime.	Yebetumi akɔ awia anaa anwummere aduan bere bi.
I just love it more.	M’ani gye ho kɛse ara kwa.
I just want to watch.	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ kɛkɛ.
Look at the mouth it is.	Hwɛ ano a ɛyɛ.
It didn't feel like him anymore.	Ná ɛnte nka sɛ ɔno bio.
Put it another way.	Fa ka no ɔkwan foforo so.
I am a human being.	Meyɛ onipa.
Don’t settle for more and more.	Mma w’ani nnye pii ne pii ho.
So much worse than that.	Enti bɔne pii sen saa.
Perhaps people should think a little.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo susuw nneɛma ho kakra.
But it doesn’t work the other way around.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma ɔkwan foforo so.
We both take risks.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa de yɛn ho to asiane mu.
That wasn’t much of a surprise.	Ná ɛno nyɛ nwonwa kɛse.
Let him eat them.	Ma onni wɔn.
A similar situation exists here.	Tebea a ɛte saa ara wɔ ha.
She lives alone in a large house.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔte ofie kɛse bi mu.
Make it work.	Ma ɛnyɛ adwuma.
Not so, but either way.	Ɛnyɛ saa, nanso ɔkwan biara so.
There’s plenty of room for you!.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a, ɛwɔ baabi a ɛdɔɔso ma wo!.
I'm still on it.	Meda so ara wɔ so.
It was just a job.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
If there is a.	Sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ a.
He didn't want to get involved.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu.
That would be nice.	Ɛno bɛyɛ fɛ.
I have done something wonderful.	Mayɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He knows how to say this.	Onim sɛnea wɔka saa asɛm yi.
I work every day.	Meyɛ adwuma da biara da.
This was a mistake.	Ná eyi yɛ mfomso.
It didn’t need to be there.	Ná enhia sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
I’m not like anyone else here.	Me nte sɛ obiara wɔ ha.
This was definitely a problem.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na eyi yɛ ɔhaw.
And they would both be at the meeting.	Na na wɔn baanu nyinaa bɛba nhyiam no ase.
Almost everyone seems to agree.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara gye tom saa.
No one knows but us.	Obiara nnim gye sɛ yɛn nkutoo.
But promise me this.	Nanso hyɛ me eyi ho bɔ.
My kids must be feeling cold.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ me mma no te awɔw nka.
Pick up and get back on your way.	Fa wo ho na san kɔ wo kwan so.
Lots of information, lots of information.	Nsɛm pii, nsɛm pii.
It’s the girl who does that.	Ɛyɛ abeawa no na ɔyɛ saa.
Many still do so.	Pii da so ara yɛ saa.
Close to many things.	Bɛn nneɛma pii ho.
This is far from obvious.	Eyi nyɛ nea ɛda adi koraa.
So one has to be very careful.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ obi hwɛ yiye paa.
We cannot make alcohol a part of the curriculum.	Yɛrentumi mma nsa nyɛ adesua nhyehyɛe no fã.
This has to happen.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi ba.
It is a very beautiful picture.	Ɛyɛ mfonini a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He had to be quick.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ntɛm.
The police are here.	Polisifo no wɔ ha.
Replenish your power.	San hyɛ wo tumi ma.
Maybe a lot of things.	Ebia nneɛma pii.
I know him very well.	Minim no yiye.
Resources need to involve more people.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma no ma nnipa pii ka ho.
It must have been difficult for everyone.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ den ma obiara.
It’s absolutely everything.	Ɛyɛ biribiara koraa.
A man could barely see her.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɔbarima bi ntumi nhu no.
Everything was at stake.	Ná biribiara da asiane mu.
But that’s how it works.	Nanso saa na ɛyɛ adwuma.
Or it happened at the same time.	Anaasɛ esii bere koro no ara mu.
All the information is there.	Nsɛm no nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
The cheaper ones have two tests.	Wɔn a ne bo nyɛ den no wɔ sɔhwɛ abien.
Unlike herself.	Nea ɛnte sɛ ɔno ankasa.
We do that a lot.	Yɛyɛ saa pii.
The party was a lot of fun.	Ná apontow no yɛ anigye kɛse.
The interesting books are his.	Nhoma ahorow a ɛyɛ anigye no yɛ ne de.
There is a squirrel living here.	Ɔkraman bi te ha.
This may be true, and it may not be.	Ebia eyi yɛ nokware, na ebia ɛnyɛ nokware.
Or maybe it’s not.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛnte saa.
The picture is the story of a terrible story.	Mfonini no yɛ asɛm bi a ɛyɛ hu ho asɛm.
All images must be one image only.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mfonini ahorow nyinaa yɛ mfonini biako nkutoo.
I don’t really like it.	M’ani nnye ho ankasa.
Half of the night.	Anadwo fã.
It does, and it should.	Ɛyɛ saa, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
He told me so, in his letter.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me saa, wɔ ne krataa no mu.
He was as strong and strong as he was impressive.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ den na ne ho yɛ den te sɛ nea na ne ho yɛ nwonwa no ara pɛ.
Look back, first of all.	Hwɛ akyi, nea edi kan koraa no.
I usually don’t do this.	Mpɛn pii no, menyɛ eyi.
Look at that hand.	Hwɛ saa nsa no.
His bedroom was down the road from mine.	Ná ne mpa no wɔ ɔkwan no ase fi me de no so.
This is the best idea in my opinion.	Eyi ne adwene a eye sen biara wɔ m’adwene mu.
And it was so.	Na ɛte saa.
It was a big surprise surprise for both of us.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa kɛse a ɛyɛ nwonwa ma yɛn baanu nyinaa.
This was surprisingly difficult.	Ná eyi mu yɛ den ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He will do a great job.	Ɔbɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
And so did I.	Na me nso.
However, things are not so simple today.	Nanso, nneɛma nyɛ mmerɛw saa nnɛ.
A first-time enthusiast might say.	Ebia obi a ɔwɔ anigye a odi kan bɛka sɛ.
I knew it well.	Ná minim yiye.
The intellectual side, for one thing.	Nyansa fã no, ade biako nti.
However, it wasn’t.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ saa.
He really knows how to drive.	Onim sɛnea wɔka kar ankasa.
On time tomorrow.	Wɔ bere ano ɔkyena.
Maybe that’s not such a bad thing.	Ebia ɛno nyɛ ade bɔne a ɛte saa.
Our plan worked out.	Yɛn nhyehyɛe no yɛɛ yiye.
I always looked forward to this day.	Ná mehwɛ da yi kwan bere nyinaa.
It was a long time ago.	Ná akyɛ.
It's his favorite song.	Ɛyɛ dwom a n'ani gye ho paa.
I had to be like him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ sɛ ɔno.
But it’s not good.	Nanso ɛnyɛ papa.
It’s the truth.	Ɛyɛ nokware no.
This might just work out really well.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ yiye ankasa kɛkɛ.
I just want to do something about it.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ho biribi kɛkɛ.
A man was imprisoned.	Wɔde ɔbarima bi too afiase.
I wish we could be friends.	Me yam a anka yebetumi ayɛ nnamfo.
Some time ago, not recently.	Bere bi a atwam ni, ɛnyɛ nnansa yi ara.
It has definitely worked well for us.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ayɛ adwuma yiye ama yɛn.
During the walk.	Wɔ nantew no mu.
There is really nothing better.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ papa sen saa ankasa.
This often ends badly.	Eyi taa ba awiei bɔne.
Don’t have me.	Nni me.
Not even me, really.	Ɛnyɛ me mpo, ampa.
The next meeting will be next month.	Nhyiam a edi hɔ no bɛyɛ ɔsram a edi hɔ no.
Only one of them works.	Wɔn mu biako pɛ na ɛyɛ adwuma.
What is your favorite season?	Bere bɛn na w’ani gye ho paa?
You know how these things work.	Wunim sɛnea saa nneɛma yi yɛ adwuma.
A great job.	Adwuma kɛse bi.
He was not at fault.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɔno na odi mfomso.
I see people on the side of the road.	Mihu nkurɔfo wɔ ɔkwan no nkyɛn.
You know you can do this over and over and over again.	Wunim sɛ wubetumi ayɛ eyi mpɛn pii ne mpɛn pii.
It’s not what it has.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ.
There must be a better way!	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ!
And he was part of it.	Na ɔyɛ ne fã.
You can’t think like that.	Worentumi nsusuw nneɛma ho saa.
And so what does this mean.	Na enti dɛn na eyi kyerɛ.
But you can’t keep doing that.	Nanso worentumi nkɔ so nyɛ saa.
People like you.	Nkurɔfo te sɛ wo.
However, the prospects are very exciting for manufacturers.	Nanso, anidaso no yɛ anigye kɛse ma nneɛma a wɔyɛ no.
Walking was once helpful and it works now.	Na nantew aboa pɛn na ɛyɛ adwuma mprempren.
But something else had happened.	Nanso na biribi foforo asi.
Even as it is today.	Sɛnea ɛte nnɛ mpo no.
They are done in this way.	Wɔyɛ saa kwan yi so.
Faster, and faster, and faster.	Ntɛmntɛm, ne ntɛmntɛm, ne ntɛmntɛm.
This made me interested.	Eyi maa m’ani gyee ho.
The walk was not too difficult.	Ná nantew no nyɛ den dodo.
I love being me.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ me.
You can’t beat time or age.	Worentumi nni bere anaa mfe a obi adi so nkonim.
Check it out here.	Hwɛ ha.
That’s not good for anyone.	Ɛno nyɛ papa mma obiara.
Let everyone know what you do.	Ma obiara nhu nea woyɛ.
They were his friends, after all.	Na wɔyɛ ne nnamfo, ne nyinaa akyi no.
It was just sitting out there.	Ná ɛte abɔnten hɔ ara kwa.
He was amazing looking.	Ná ne ho yɛ nwonwa.
I truly understand now.	Mete ase ampa mprempren.
The team played well in the first half.	Kuw no dii agoru yiye wɔ fã a edi kan no mu.
It didn’t seem to matter.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia.
Nobody wants him.	Obiara mpɛ no.
Just one afternoon.	Awia biako pɛ.
In the bedroom there are two beds.	Wɔ mpa no mu no, mpa abien wɔ hɔ.
I shouldn’t have said anything.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meka hwee.
The book was excellent.	Ná nhoma no yɛ papa yiye.
The man walked closer.	Ɔbarima no nantew bɛn no.
Maria has been around since then.	Maria fi saa bere no.
Just stay here.	Tra ha nkutoo.
Try harder, they tell us.	Bɔ mmɔden kɛse, wɔka kyerɛ yɛn.
My power is over me.	Me tumi wɔ me so.
I was his everything.	Ná meyɛ ne biribiara.
We are terrible.	Yɛyɛ hu.
This is the end of your career.	Eyi ne wo adwuma no awiei.
But that's over with, though.	Nanso ɛno aba awiei wɔ, nanso.
Hang out.	Kɔ gye w’ani.
At night, as dangerous as it was.	Anadwo, sɛnea na asiane wom no.
I have an idea of ​​what we can do.	Mewɔ adwene bi wɔ nea yebetumi ayɛ ho.
Everyone certainly seemed to have a great time.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛte sɛ nea obiara nyaa anigye kɛse.
Was there no traffic on the road?	So na kar biara nni kwan no so?
The kids had to play outside.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra no di agoru wɔ abɔnten.
There is usually one idea, one plan behind such a project.	Mpɛn pii no, adwene biako, nhyehyɛe biako na ɛwɔ adwuma a ɛte saa akyi.
However, that doesn’t work.	Nanso, ɛno ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
Not everything is free, you know.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara na ɛyɛ kwa, wunim.
But inside!!.	Nanso wɔ mu!!.
Maybe there is.	Ebia ɛwɔ hɔ.
Maybe it’s the end anyway.	Ebia ɛyɛ awiei no ɔkwan biara so.
Faster than he could believe.	Ntɛmntɛm sen sɛnea na obetumi agye adi.
Or even faking it that way.	Anaasɛ mpo atoro a wɔyɛ wɔ saa kwan no so.
He’s a wonderful guy.	Ɔyɛ nwonwa.
If that’s your thing, run with it.	Sɛ ɛno ne wo ade a, fa tu mmirika.
For the rest, here’s how it works.	Nea aka no, sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma ni.
So we can share information.	Enti yebetumi akyɛ nsɛm.
I know their power.	Minim wɔn tumi.
Look at the pictures.	Hwɛ mfonini ahorow no.
I knew it would be.	Ná minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Very good from him.	Eye paa fi ne hɔ.
Very good indeed	Eye paa ampa .
But this was a look.	Nanso na eyi yɛ hwɛ.
Don’t walk home at night.	Mfa nantew nkɔ fie anadwo.
Other days, nothing good.	Nna foforo nso, biribi pa biara nni hɔ.
Work on it.	Yɛ adwuma wɔ ho.
However, there was nothing to do now.	Nanso, na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ mprempren.
It was a huge issue of male privilege.	Na ɛyɛ ɔbarima hokwan ho asɛm kɛse bi.
I didn’t know where he lived at the time.	Saa bere no na minnim baabi a ɔte.
I will give you everything.	Mede biribiara bɛma wo.
I’m looking forward to tomorrow.	M’ani agye ɔkyena ho.
This highway is usually heavily trafficked.	Mpɛn pii no, kar taa fa ɔkwan kɛse yi so kɛse.
Maybe none of them are here.	Ebia mu biara nni ha.
I am running out of resources.	Nneɛma a mede bɛyɛ adwuma no ho ayɛ me den.
I may have two friends.	Ebia mewɔ nnamfo baanu.
He was obsessed with the meeting.	Ná nhyiam no ho adwene agye ne so.
I wasn’t doing that.	Ná menyɛ saa.
But people do that.	Nanso nkurɔfo yɛ saa.
The idea was new.	Ná adwene no yɛ foforo.
No one would have been there already by then.	Anka obiara ntumi nkɔ hɔ dedaw saa bere no.
It’s too bad.	Ɛyɛ bɔne dodo.
I think that would be ideal.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
Until things just get better.	Kosi sɛ nneɛma bɛkɔ so ayɛ yiye ara kwa.
Or any other man.	Anaasɛ ɔbarima foforo biara.
I was still in shock.	Ná meda so ara ho dwiriw me.
So, there is no problem.	Enti, ɔhaw biara nni ho.
Add all the other ingredients.	Fa nneɛma a aka nyinaa ka ho.
He handed me the letter.	Ɔde krataa no maa me.
If you just want to do it, why have another job.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ ara kwa a, dɛn nti na wowɔ adwuma foforo.
That was exciting.	Ná ɛno yɛ anigye.
She was so charming.	Ná ɔyɛ saa a ne ho yɛ fɛ saa.
Watch them do it.	Hwɛ wɔn sɛnea wɔyɛ.
I slept more or less.	Ná meda pii anaasɛ na meda kakraa bi.
Not even one of them.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn mu biako mpo.
He is one of them now.	Ɔyɛ wɔn mu biako mprempren.
The house is close to that apartment.	Ofie no bɛn saa dan no.
The work has its price.	Adwuma no wɔ ne bo.
She was a beautiful girl.	Ná ɔyɛ abeawa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It was definitely his.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛyɛ ne de.
The same is true here.	Saa ara nso na ha nso.
I just loved playing with the guy.	Ná m’ani gye ho ara ne sɛ me ne ɔbarima no bedi agoru.
They were focused.	Ná wɔde wɔn adwene asi so.
Alternatively you can have breakfast, lunch or dinner.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wubetumi adi anɔpa, awia anaa anwummere aduan.
Good water is not needed.	Nsu pa ho nhia.
I loved the house.	M’ani gyee ofie no ho.
His mind touched many things.	N’adwene kaa nneɛma pii.
I was equal to him.	Ná me ne no yɛ pɛ.
So why did the boy do that?	Enti dɛn nti na abarimaa no yɛɛ saa?
In this case, the user also provides some prior information.	Wɔ eyi mu no, nea ɔde di dwuma no de nsɛm bi a edi kan nso ma.
I need to talk to him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa.
That’s all the fun of it.	Ɛno ne anigye a ɛwɔ mu no nyinaa.
I looked just like him.	Ná me ho te sɛ ɔno ara pɛ.
But that is not entirely true.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ nokware koraa.
Finally, he nodded.	Awiei koraa no, ɔde ne ti too fam.
Don’t believe their claims.	Nnye wɔn nsɛm no nni.
Not very exciting.	Ɛnyɛ anigye kɛse.
Things are really heating up.	Nneɛma reyɛ hyew ankasa.
There is already a lot of potential here.	Tumi kɛse wɔ ha dedaw.
You don’t even know if these things really exist.	Wunnim mpo sɛ ebia saa nneɛma yi wɔ hɔ ampa anaa.
He will go to school.	Ɔbɛkɔ sukuu.
Besides, you never do what you’re told.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, wonyɛ nea wɔka kyerɛ wo no da.
I can only drive one car at a time.	Kar biako pɛ na metumi aka bere koro mu.
There would be plenty of time to shake hands later.	Anka bere pii bɛba a wɔde bɛbɔ wɔn nsa akyiri yi.
I always forget something.	Me werɛ fi biribi bere nyinaa.
I have plenty of space.	Mewɔ baabi a ɛdɔɔso.
Just play the game.	Di agoru no ara kwa.
Maybe he didn’t really know anyone there.	Ebia na onnim obiara wɔ hɔ ankasa.
Tell me where you are.	Ka baabi a wowɔ kyerɛ me.
It really should be the other way around.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔkwan foforo so ankasa.
That’s just you.	Ɛno ara ne wo.
It’s bad for him.	Ɛyɛ bɔne ma no.
I feel so bad about it.	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne saa.
It was as it should be.	Ná ɛte saa sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
Every day the test is the same.	Da biara sɔhwɛ no yɛ ade koro.
But there is no such thing.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
I had a good time here.	Me nyaa anigye wɔ ha.
It was never like that.	Ná ɛnte saa da.
Hopefully that’s just me.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno ne me nkutoo.
It was really great of him to be able to do that.	Na ɛyɛ ne kɛse ankasa sɛ obetumi ayɛ saa.
The age of exposure had finally begun.	Ná mfe a wɔde da wɔn ho adi no afi ase awiei koraa.
The dog was barking at the window.	Ná ɔkraman no rebɔ mfɛnsere no ho.
It was mundane and terrifying.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ hu.
We could help them a little.	Ná yebetumi aboa wɔn kakraa bi.
The evening was difficult.	Ná anwummere no yɛ den.
The water was strong.	Ná nsu no ano yɛ den.
It seemed so great to me at the time.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ kɛse paa ma me saa bere no.
His gestures were beautiful.	Ná ne nsa a ɔde yɛ ade no yɛ fɛ.
Things are not easy for me right now.	Nneɛma nyɛ mmerɛw mma me mprempren.
He loved stories.	Ná ɔpɛ nsɛm.
I can’t hear you.	Mintumi nte wo.
I'm sure it would be a lot of fun.	Migye di sɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
But if you do, you won’t be able to solve your problem right away.	Nanso sɛ woyɛ saa a, worentumi nni wo haw no ho dwuma ntɛm ara.
I received a letter from both of them.	Me nsa kaa krataa bi fii wɔn baanu hɔ.
You have a sense of language.	Wowɔ kasa ho adwene bi.
It’s just money.	Ɛyɛ sika kɛkɛ.
Anyone can participate.	Obiara betumi de ne ho ahyɛ mu.
Maybe you’ll do the same.	Ebia wo nso wobɛyɛ saa.
I’m excited about this.	M’ani gyee eyi ho.
I want you to know that.	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu saa.
My father had no other children but me.	Na me papa nni mma foforo biara gye me.
Don’t tell anyone who told you.	Nka nkyerɛ obiara a ɔka kyerɛɛ wo no.
He nods his head down.	Ɔde ne ti to fam.
Anyone can do any job.	Obiara betumi ayɛ adwuma biara.
But it wasn’t that bad though.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ bɔne saa de.
Work on the plan.	Yɛ nhyehyɛe no ho adwuma.
You can find it here.	Wubetumi ahu no wɔ ha.
This statement surprised him.	Saa asɛm yi maa ne ho dwiriw no.
I think it's pretty good for a phone.	Misusuw sɛ eye yiye ma telefon.
It looks very interesting.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
But, never say never.	Nanso, nka da sɛ da.
I’m interested in that.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
If you know what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, that’s fine.	Sɛ wunim nea woreyɛ ne nea enti a woreyɛ a, eye.
I want you to tell me everything.	Mepɛ sɛ woka biribiara kyerɛ me.
I don’t think his wife likes me very much.	Minsusuw sɛ ne yere ani nnye me ho kɛse.
I love that idea, make the house a picture.	M’ani gye saa adwene no ho, ma ofie no nyɛ mfonini.
There is no need to do that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
I don’t have enough power.	Me nni tumi a ɛdɔɔso.
I do the same thing.	Me nso meyɛ saa.
I see that now.	Mihu saa mprempren.
See how hot or cold it is.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ hyew anaa awɔw wom.
There was something in their eyes.	Na biribi wɔ wɔn ani so.
I just couldn’t believe it.	Ná mintumi nnye nni kɛkɛ.
You can do whatever you want.	Wubetumi ayɛ nea wopɛ biara.
But it’s not as much of a problem as you think.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɔhaw kɛse sɛnea wususuw no.
That attitude is a virtue.	Saa adwene no yɛ su pa.
People don’t always understand me.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na nkurɔfo te me ase.
I'm taking him away.	Mede no rekɔ.
I believe he has done so.	Migye di sɛ wayɛ saa.
He knows he doesn’t.	Onim sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
I think this is it.	Misusuw sɛ eyi ne no.
I picked up the phone.	Mede gyee telefon no.
We can never.	Yɛrentumi da.
I didn't really have a reason.	Ná minni nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa.
That’s what most people do.	Ɛno ne nea nnipa dodow no ara yɛ.
This would have been great.	Anka eyi bɛyɛ kɛse.
Good, not great.	Eye, ɛnyɛ kɛse.
A few very important things.	Nneɛma kakraa bi a ɛho hia yiye.
It’s just what you have to do.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ara kwa.
I'm giving myself away.	Mede me ho ma.
So please give me some perspective.	Enti mesrɛ wo ma me adwene bi.
It is a given.	Ɛyɛ ade a wɔde ama.
But, you know?	Nanso, wunim?
I beg you this.	Mesrɛ mo yi.
I owe you my life.	Mede me nkwa ka wo.
Right now, that’s my opinion.	Seesei ara, ɛno ne m’adwene.
I am a work in progress.	Meyɛ adwuma a ɛrekɔ so.
This article is not about them.	Saa asɛm yi nka wɔn ho asɛm.
Those people have to work things out internally.	Ɛsɛ sɛ saa nkurɔfo no yɛ nneɛma ho adwuma wɔ wɔn mu.
I know it’s terrible.	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ hu.
I’m of the opinion that there are some good things going on.	M’adwene ne sɛ nneɛma pa bi wɔ hɔ a ɛrekɔ so.
I always thought that was pretty cool.	Bere nyinaa na misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ fɛ yiye.
He had a lot of money.	Ná ɔwɔ sika kɛse.
He didn’t seem to like it.	Ɛte sɛ nea na n’ani nnye ho.
Only you can do that.	Wo nkutoo na wubetumi ayɛ saa.
It is not so.	Ɛnte saa.
We can talk about this at length.	Yebetumi aka asɛm yi ho asɛm tenten.
Another accident happened a little later.	Akwanhyia foforo sii akyiri kakra.
Tomorrow will be our last day here.	Ɔkyena bɛyɛ yɛn da a etwa to wɔ ha.
But not here or now.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ha anaa mprempren.
We have many more photos to add.	Yɛwɔ mfonini foforo pii a yɛde bɛka ho.
He doesn’t want me and not him.	Ɔmpɛ me na ɛnyɛ ɔno.
This could be an accident.	Eyi betumi ayɛ akwanhyia.
You did a fantastic job with them too.	Wo ne wɔn nso yɛɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
You can leave at any time if you are not happy.	Wubetumi afi hɔ bere biara sɛ w’ani nnye a.
He wanted to talk to the boy.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne abarimaa no kasa.
He had only one dress.	Ná ɔwɔ atade biako pɛ.
Remove it, when you see a lock.	Yi fi hɔ, bere a wuhu biribi a wɔde to mu no.
Everything is psychological.	Biribiara yɛ adwene mu de.
At least not just for that reason.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ ɛno nti kɛkɛ.
At least make sure he was doing something.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, hwɛ sɛ na ɔreyɛ biribi.
These interests are certainly important.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ saa nneɛma a wɔn ani gye ho yi ho hia.
No one had ever done that before.	Ná obiara nyɛɛ saa da.
He's got the team in trouble.	Ɔde kuw no akɔ ɔhaw mu.
I felt myself burning up.	Metee nka sɛ me ho ayɛ hyew.
It seems to be the only one.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ biako pɛ.
It shouldn’t be there.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
Update your profile here.	Yɛ wo ho nsɛm foforo wɔ ha.
It has a very first order.	Ɛwɔ nhyehyɛe a edi kan koraa.
The story went on for years.	Asɛm no kɔɔ so mfe pii.
He wanted so much for us.	Ná ɔpɛ pii ma yɛn.
Apparently, the old one.	Ɛda adi sɛ, dedaw no.
It’s all music.	Ne nyinaa yɛ nnwom.
Don’t do this.	Mma wonyɛ eyi.
And money was scarce.	Na na sika ho ayɛ tiaa.
He found it difficult to concentrate on the work.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma no sɛ ɔde n’adwene besi adwuma no so.
There is a big story going on.	Asɛm kɛse bi rekɔ so.
He was new, about a month into the job.	Ná ɔyɛ foforo, bɛyɛ ɔsram biako wɔ adwuma no mu.
We were here.	Ná yɛwɔ ha.
We are very happy.	Yɛn ani agye yiye.
Why does everyone talk so fast?	Dɛn nti na obiara kasa ntɛmntɛm saa?
I can't' believe it.	Me ntumi no' gye di.
It’s a whole new thing.	Ɛyɛ ade foforo koraa.
He was hers for life.	Ná ɔyɛ ne de nkwa nna nyinaa.
That was really your style.	Ná ɛno yɛ wo su ankasa.
It just looks beautiful.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa.
He loved working there.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ.
It’s really bad.	Ɛyɛ bɔne ankasa.
Less publicity on the street would be ideal.	Nea wɔka fa ho kakraa bi wɔ abɔnten no bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
There are animals.	Mmoa wɔ hɔ.
Remember that name, say that name.	Kae saa din no, ka saa din no.
There are many people.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ.
Maybe he did too.	Ebia ɔno nso yɛɛ saa.
They were interested in that.	Ná wɔn ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
So, tell your friends.	Enti, ka kyerɛ wo nnamfo.
He had done it before and it had ended badly.	Ná wayɛ saa pɛn na na aba awiei bɔne.
And you do, too.	Na wo nso woyɛ.
Start with that, and that alone.	Fi ase fi ɛno so, na ɛno nkutoo.
He knew what he wanted.	Ná onim nea ɔpɛ.
They were also very good.	Na wɔyɛ papa paa nso.
However, this part of the project can be exciting.	Nanso, adwuma no fã yi betumi ayɛ anigye.
Everyone should work from that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara yɛ adwuma fi saa mu.
Most expected it.	Dodow no ara hwɛɛ kwan.
I did a lot of things.	Meyɛɛ pii.
Her hair was very short.	Ná ne ti nhwi yɛ tiaa paa.
The gun is hard.	Tuo no yɛ den.
Otherwise, it should not reveal anything.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛda biribiara adi.
It’s a nice day.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye.
The display and controls are easy to use.	Nneɛma a wɔde kyerɛ ne nea wɔde di dwuma no yɛ mmerɛw sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
I am well aware of that.	Minim saa asɛm no yiye.
This was one for me.	Ná eyi yɛ biako ma me.
A week ago, no one had heard of him.	Dapɛn biako a atwam ni no, na obiara nte ne ho asɛm.
These kinds of things.	Saa nneɛma ahorow yi.
Maybe that was true.	Ebia na ɛno yɛ nokware.
This is one of the important results in our paper.	Eyi yɛ nneɛma a ɛho hia a afi mu aba wɔ yɛn krataa no mu no mu biako.
Nothing else has worked.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ayɛ adwuma.
A new house.	Ofie foforo.
The dog was home alone.	Ná ɔkraman no nkutoo na ɔwɔ fie.
Where there is life, there is hope.	Baabi a nkwa wɔ no, anidaso wɔ hɔ.
This is it! 	Eyi ne no!
You have to tell the truth.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka nokware.
I don’t have the time.	Minni bere no.
Everyone is great with him.	Obiara ne no yɛ kɛse.
We are good.	Yɛyɛ papa.
Insert it thoroughly.	Fa ahyɛ mu yiye.
It’s really one.	Ɛyɛ biako ankasa.
Things can get better.	Nneɛma betumi ayɛ papa.
In long arms.	Wɔ nsa tenten mu.
I never knew what he was going to do with it.	Ná minnim nea ɔde bɛyɛ da.
Don’t speculate or speculate.	Mma nsusuw nneɛma ho anaasɛ nsusuw ho.
Something should have been done about that too.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi wɔ ɛno nso ho.
This is obviously not true at all.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
That boy this afternoon.	Saa abarimaa no awia yi.
I couldn’t be late.	Ná mintumi nka akyi.
I would have been comfortable.	Anka me ho bɛtɔ me.
You think you know everything about them.	Wususuw sɛ wunim wɔn ho biribiara.
There was something else, though.	Nanso, na biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
I am short on reach.	Meyɛ tiaa wɔ baabi a metumi adu ho.
There were many interests.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a n’ani gye ho.
Make yourself a meal.	Yɛ wo ho aduan.
It was the team, folks.	Na ɛyɛ kuw no, nkurɔfo.
Get involved in sex.	Fa wo ho hyɛ nna mu.
The police took him into custody.	Polisifo de no too afiase.
Naturally, he didn't want to.	Sɛnea ɛte no, na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
It was a huge risk.	Ná ɛyɛ asiane kɛse.
Be careful about it.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ ho.
We all love his stuff.	Yɛn nyinaa ani gye ne nneɛma ho.
He wrapped his arms around her.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne mu.
It all meant nothing.	Ná ne nyinaa nkyerɛ hwee.
Maybe he could find her.	Ebia na obetumi ahu no.
This was still his home.	Ná eyi da so ara yɛ ne fie.
They are two opinions.	Wɔyɛ adwene abien.
First of all.	Nea edi kan koraa.
I thought you were working.	Misusuwii sɛ woreyɛ adwuma.
His mother had done the same.	Ná ne maame nso ayɛ saa.
At least it was wet and cold.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛyɛ nsu na awɔw wom.
You should do better next time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ yiye bere foforo.
But tell your mother.	Nanso ka kyerɛ wo maame.
And believe me, this job had to be done.	Na gye me di, na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa adwuma yi.
Play with the other kids.	Wo ne mmofra a aka no nni agoru.
I have something on someone else.	Mewɔ biribi wɔ obi foforo so.
And they were terrible.	Na wɔyɛ hu.
I work well with my mom.	Me ne me maame yɛ adwuma yiye.
It is not popular for nothing.	Ɛnyɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho kwa.
However, the story does not end here.	Nanso, asɛm no nkɔ awiei wɔ ha.
None of them, no one can survive.	Wɔn mu biara, obiara ntumi nnya nkwa.
This sounds terrible.	Eyi te sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
But he may be working now.	Nanso ebia ɔreyɛ adwuma mprempren.
This is important for two reasons.	Nneɛma abien nti na eyi ho hia.
So every moment is the same as every other moment.	Enti bere biara yɛ pɛ sɛ bere foforo biara.
The former happened here.	Kan no sii wɔ ha.
Check the literature if necessary.	Hwɛ nhoma ahorow no mu sɛ ɛho hia a.
The squirrel had eaten the cat’s food.	Ná ɔkraman no adi ɔkraman no aduan.
Can you give it to me.	So wubetumi de ama me.
There were many things he did not know.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a na onnim.
True in a way he never knew.	Ampa wɔ ɔkwan bi a na onnim da so.
Available working day.	Adwuma da a ɛwɔ hɔ.
What you want.	Nea wopɛ.
We can’t say anything.	Yɛrentumi nka hwee.
Do whatever you want there.	Yɛ nea wopɛ biara wɔ hɔ.
It’s a little better now.	Ɛyɛ papa kakra mprempren.
We have given each other our stories.	Yɛde yɛn nsɛm ama yɛn ho yɛn ho.
Obviously, there is nothing like his.	Ɛda adi sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ ne de no.
They are not too pretty.	Wɔn ho nyɛ fɛ dodo.
The people are very optimistic.	Nkurɔfo no wɔ anidaso kɛse.
It was an exciting time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ anigye.
It was hard, hard.	Ná ɛyɛ den, na ɛyɛ den.
Is there anyone there?	So obi wɔ hɔ?
He has to do it all himself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa yɛ ne nyinaa.
I’m excited about this and we’re lucky here.	M’ani agye eyi ho na yɛwɔ anigye wɔ ha.
End the test.	Fa sɔhwɛ no ba awiei.
No one had ever thought of doing that before, either.	Ná obiara nsusuw ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa pɛn, nso.
That’s not what I want.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea mepɛ.
And tomorrow came again.	Na ɔkyena nso baa bio.
Nor is there anyone who posted it or knew it was there.	Saa ara nso na nea ɔde too hɔ anaa nea na onim sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ no nni hɔ.
Maybe he’s not as bad as it sounds.	Ebia ɔnyɛ bɔne sɛnea ɛte no.
That was nothing.	Ná ɛno nyɛ hwee.
That’s when the story happened.	Ɛno na asɛm no sii.
You really shouldn’t.	Ankasa ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
When that didn’t work, he joined.	Bere a ɛno antumi anyɛ yiye no, ɔde ne ho bɔɔ ho.
See if this is still true.	Hwɛ sɛ eyi da so ara yɛ nokware anaa.
And this is why he had no chance.	Na eyi nti na na onni hokwan biara no.
Things weren’t going well.	Ná nneɛma nkɔ yiye.
This is a good version of that movie.	Eyi yɛ saa sini no fã pa.
Maybe that was the first time.	Ebia na ɛno ne bere a edi kan.
Many people still rely on them today.	Nnipa pii da so ara de wɔn ho to wɔn so nnɛ.
You will be true to your friends and yourself.	Wobɛyɛ nokware ama wo nnamfo ne wo ho.
They all left here a good while ago.	Wɔn nyinaa fii ha bere pa bi a atwam ni.
It’s just a matter of the timeline.	Ɛyɛ bere nhyehyɛe no ho asɛm ara kwa.
Like they say.	Te sɛ nea wɔka no.
You are doing what you have to do.	Woreyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Make it fun.	Ma ɛnyɛ anigye.
which he or she.	a ɔno anaa ɔno.
That is very important to him.	Ɛno ho hia no yiye.
It’s already here, always.	Ɛwɔ ha dedaw, bere nyinaa.
I don’t understand what you mean.	Me ntumi nte nea wopɛ sɛ woka no ase.
She held her son in her arms.	Ɔde ne ba no bɔɔ ne mu.
Not on this table.	Ɛnyɛ saa pon yi so.
This is the real issue.	Eyi ne asɛm no ankasa.
Let us not forget	Yɛn werɛ mfi .
But his plan doesn’t end overnight.	Nanso ne nhyehyɛe no nkɔ awiei anadwo biako pɛ.
I can't figure out why it doesn't work.	Mintumi nhu nea enti a ɛnyɛ adwuma.
No one knows what to say.	Obiara nnim nea ɔbɛka.
I have no problem with him.	Me ne no nni ɔhaw biara.
No one here feels for you.	Obiara nni ha a ɔte nka ma wo.
This is a mistake.	Eyi yɛ mfomso.
It just feels like being at home.	Ɛte sɛ nea wowɔ fie ara kwa.
He’s just a wonderful guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
It was going to be a busy day.	Ná ɛbɛyɛ da a adagyew nnim.
The music flows.	Nnwom no sen.
So assume it isn’t.	Enti fa no sɛ ɛnte saa.
It was all over it.	Ná ɛwɔ ne nyinaa so.
And nothing goes in anymore.	Na biribiara nkɔ mu bio.
Make it another weekend.	Yɛ no dapɛn awiei foforo.
But he is an animal.	Nanso ɔyɛ aboa.
He wanted to be with her.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka ne ho.
I’ll love any face.	M’ani begye anim biara ho.
And believe me it wasn’t fun.	Na gye me di sɛ na ɛnyɛ anigye.
I think there is one thing.	Misusuw sɛ ade biako wɔ hɔ.
You have enough time.	Wowɔ bere a ɛdɔɔso.
That would be the case here.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ saa wɔ ha.
Everyone lived this way.	Obiara traa ase saa kwan yi so.
The dress is beautiful.	Atade no yɛ fɛ.
Use extra materials as much as possible.	Fa nneɛma foforo di dwuma sɛnea wubetumi biara.
He’s a really nice guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa ankasa.
At least not at all look.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ koraa hwɛ.
But our luck is not good this time.	Nanso yɛn anigye nyɛ papa saa bere yi.
Something happened to me that day.	Biribi too me saa da no.
It’s take and take.	Ɛyɛ gye na fa.
Something like this and this.	Biribi te sɛ eyi ne eyi.
Many people did two jobs.	Nnipa pii yɛɛ nnwuma abien.
Time alone was moving too fast.	Ná bere nkutoo rekɔ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
He had to tell me the story.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka asɛm no kyerɛ me.
He must have been having an important meeting.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɔyɛ nhyiam bi a ɛho hia.
First look and see.	Di kan hwɛ na hwɛ.
One of them in the city.	Wɔn mu kurow mu biako.
I don't like that.	M'ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
At night the city is vibrant and spectacular.	Anadwo na kurow no mu yɛ hyew na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I know exactly what it feels like.	Minim sɛnea ɛte no yiye.
You can be one of those people.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa nnipa no mu biako.
The organizers are new.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe no yɛ foforo.
His mother looked up at me.	Ne maame maa n’ani so hwɛɛ me.
The car is new.	Kar no yɛ foforo.
He leaned against the door.	Ɔde ne ho too ɔpon no so.
Except for my wife.	Gye me yere nkutoo.
It’s cold, good.	Ɛyɛ awɔw, eye.
Where this sits, look deeper.	Baabi a eyi te no, hwɛ mu kɔ akyiri.
I have to do something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi.
But now is not the time to act out.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mprempren ne bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ agoru.
However, this is nothing new.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ ade foforo.
I would have made up my mind.	Anka mɛyɛ m’adwene.
Put yourself in their shoes.	Fa wo ho to wɔn tebea mu.
I want to go into that room.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ saa dan no mu.
And so it is here.	Na saa ara na ɛwɔ ha.
But problems remain.	Nanso ɔhaw ahorow da so ara wɔ hɔ.
All that was in the past.	Nea na ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa wɔ bere a atwam no mu.
You just want something else.	Wopɛ biribi foforo kɛkɛ.
I doubt half of them know my name.	Migye kyim sɛ wɔn mu fã nim me din.
I just live with my wife.	Me ne me yere te kɛkɛ.
This was not a matter of his opinion.	Ná eyi nyɛ n’adwene ho asɛm.
I don’t know how he does that.	Minnim sɛnea ɔyɛ saa.
He stepped onto the road.	Ɔde ne nan sii kwan so.
It’s the same thing every year.	Ɛyɛ ade koro no ara afe biara.
And it's his.	Na ne ne.
One is a recent incident.	Biako ne asɛm bi a esii nnansa yi ara.
But it’s not, you know, not very often.	Nanso ɛnte saa, wunim, ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii.
No one knew his real name.	Ná obiara nnim ne din ankasa.
There is no one left.	Obiara nni hɔ a aka.
Not much last year.	Ɛnyɛ pii wɔ afe a etwaam no mu.
That should solve your problems.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno di wo haw ahorow ho dwuma.
However, this is only the first step.	Nanso, eyi yɛ ade a edi kan ara kwa.
And that doesn’t really mean that.	Na ɛno nkyerɛ ankasa ne sɛ.
The cold is almost gone.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ awɔw no afi hɔ.
So emergency measures are not possible.	Enti nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma ntɛm ara no ntumi nyɛ yiye.
I loved working on it.	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ ho adwuma.
Good things to think about.	Nneɛma pa a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
The phone rang full of thought.	Telefon no bɔɔ a na adwene ahyɛ mu ma.
It was in me.	Ná ɛwɔ me mu.
He was nothing to her.	Ná ɔnyɛ hwee mma no.
But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be said.	Nanso ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔka.
I just have to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ no ara kwa.
In the letter.	Wɔ krataa no mu.
It’s just you and me now.	Ɛyɛ me ne wo nkutoo mprempren.
I hear someone calling my name.	Mete sɛ obi rebɔ me din.
They are independent.	Wɔyɛ wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho.
Everything is still on.	Biribiara da so ara wɔ so.
This was a perfect opportunity.	Ná eyi yɛ hokwan a edi mũ.
I use it a lot.	Mede di dwuma kɛse.
He can definitely do better.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ obetumi ayɛ yiye.
How great for him.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ kɛse ma no.
There is a danger in that.	Asiane bi wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
He knew it would all work out.	Ná onim sɛ ne nyinaa bɛkɔ yiye.
It was all just too real.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ nokware dodo ara kwa.
He is a man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima.
I would say that it is not.	Meka sɛ ɛnte saa.
He did want to talk about it this time.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka asɛm no ho asɛm saa bere yi ampa.
Maybe not for hours, and maybe the next time.	Ebia ɛnyɛ nnɔnhwerew pii, na ebia bere a edi hɔ no nso.
This is the deadline.	Eyi ne bere a etwa to a wɔde bɛma.
Hobbies are very important.	Nneɛma a wɔde gye wɔn ani ho hia yiye.
Please put your foot in it.	Mesrɛ wo, fa wo nan hyɛ mu.
He had that since he'd taken her to bed.	Na ɔwɔ saa fi bere a ɔde no akɔ mpa so no.
I don’t know him that well.	Minnim no yiye saa.
So nothing really needs to be said.	Enti ɛho nhia sɛ wɔka biribiara ankasa.
But this latter method is not the same as the former.	Nanso ɔkwan a etwa to yi ne kan no nyɛ pɛ.
It is best to take some time early.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wode bere kakra begye ntɛm.
I thought that was the way to do it.	Misusuwii sɛ saa na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
But that thing .	Nanso saa ade no .
This is the best of the best.	Eyi yɛ nea eye sen biara.
He was with me, even when he was gone.	Ná ɔne me wɔ hɔ, bere mpo a na onni hɔ no.
We all had a wonderful time.	Yɛn nyinaa nyaa bere a ɛyɛ anigye.
This happened every morning.	Eyi sii anɔpa biara anɔpa.
I'm going to do something about it.	Me deɛ, mɛyɛ no biribi.
He was placed in solitary confinement.	Wɔde no too afiase a obiara nni hɔ mu.
What should we do about this?	Dɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ wɔ eyi ho?
He was just in good shape.	Ná ɔwɔ tebea pa mu ara kwa.
I loved those comments.	M’ani gyee saa nsɛm no ho.
I knew you.	Ná minim wo.
There is nothing new in that.	Biribi foforo biara nni saa asɛm no mu.
Don’t act too quickly.	Mma wonyɛ ade ntɛm dodo.
Mary was not at all surprised.	Mary ho anyɛ no nwonwa koraa.
However, for now.	Nanso, mprempren de.
So you remember.	So wokae.
Many described her as “the most beautiful.”	Nnipa pii kaa ne ho asɛm sɛ “nea ne ho yɛ fɛ sen biara.”
You were beautiful.	Ná wo ho yɛ fɛ.
Even he doesn’t see that.	Ɔno mpo nhu saa.
He’s this great guy and he’s a good guy.	Ɔyɛ saa ɔbarima kɛse yi na ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa.
Most people come to me with back problems.	Nnipa dodow no ara de akyi haw ba me nkyɛn.
The same goes for the next day.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ da a edi hɔ no ho.
It was something big.	Ná ɛyɛ biribi kɛse bi.
You are really good friends.	Woyɛ nnamfo pa ankasa.
Or something like that.	Anaasɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
Time has passed.	Bere atwam.
What should that be.	Dɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ.
I agree with the police.	Me ne polisifo no yɛ adwene.
But part of him needs to know.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ne fã bi hu.
This story kept me awake at night.	Saa asɛm yi maa m’ani da anadwo.
He goes too, too.	Ɔno nso kɔ.
This is just one use of our images.	Eyi yɛ yɛn mfonini ahorow no a yɛde di dwuma biako pɛ.
I touch them with my hands.	Mede me nsa ka wɔn.
It’s a full and complete game.	Ɛyɛ agoru a ɛyɛ ma na edi mũ.
But this is done manually, and therefore costs more.	Nanso wɔde nsa na ɛyɛ eyi, na ɛno nti ɛho ka yɛ kɛse.
Many people gave him very positive feedback.	Nnipa pii de nsɛm pa kɛse maa no.
But he did it well.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ no ​​yiye.
Transportation to these schools is obviously important.	Ɛda adi sɛ kar a wɔde kɔ sukuu ahorow yi mu ho hia.
But that is no longer the case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte bio.
He was hopeful, anyway.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso, sɛnea ɛte biara.
Play around and see how you do.	Di agoru na hwɛ sɛnea wobɛyɛ.
Things and people.	Nneɛma ne nnipa.
Take the first half.	Fa fã a edi kan no.
It seemed like such a good idea.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea adwene pa a ɛte saa.
If so, that’s the way it is.	Sɛ ɛte saa a, saa na ɛte.
But not much at all.	Nanso ɛnyɛ pii koraa.
Everyone wants to talk about it.	Obiara pɛ sɛ ɔka ho asɛm.
He doesn’t have to tell me anymore.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɔka kyerɛ me bio.
I can barely leave my house.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi mfi me fie.
This is just amazing.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
But when you think about it, it’s really great.	Nanso sɛ wususuw ho a, ɛyɛ kɛse ankasa.
I have a lot of money.	Mewɔ sika pii.
This is our plan.	Eyi ne yɛn nhyehyɛe no.
And look at me.	Na hwɛ me.
I wanted you.	Ná mepɛ wo.
My mother, however, was a different story.	Nanso, na me maame yɛ asɛm foforo.
I did the same with his.	Meyɛɛ ne de no saa ara.
But that is not really true.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ nokware ankasa.
Still be careful.	Da so ara hwɛ yiye.
For the most part so far, they were already impressed.	Wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu de besi nnɛ no, na wɔn ani agye ho dedaw.
He didn't seem surprised.	Ɛte sɛ nea na ɛnyɛ no nwonwa.
But this really goes a long way.	Nanso eyi kɔ akyiri koraa ankasa.
The street was outside.	Na abɔnten no wɔ abɔnten.
In any case, he was not surprised.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na ɛnyɛ no nwonwa.
It was just a place to see.	Ná ɛyɛ baabi a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu ara kwa.
That really surprised me.	Ɛno maa me ho dwiriw me ankasa.
Everyone has a car.	Obiara wɔ kar.
They just seemed to work well.	Na ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ adwuma yiye ara kwa.
I'm the other girl.	Me ne abeawa foforo no.
The status quo has to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ tebea a ɛwɔ hɔ no kɔ.
His children were not all that fond of him.	Ná ne mma ani nnye ne ho saa nyinaa.
And that’s going to happen.	Na ɛno nso rekɔ so.
Things have been getting better.	Nneɛma akɔ so ayɛ yiye.
And most importantly.	Na nea ɛho hia sen biara.
I couldn’t control him.	Ná mintumi nni ne so.
However, they were not successful.	Nanso, wɔn ho anyɛ yiye.
But first things first.	Nanso nneɛma a edi kan a edi kan.
I don’t know how, but he is.	Minnim sɛnea ɛte, nanso ɔte saa.
He was very skilled.	Ná ne ho akokwaw paa.
I am studying him.	Mereyɛ ne ho adesua.
Nothing matters now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛho hia mprempren.
Keep yourself busy.	Ma wo ho nyɛ adagyew.
He placed them on the table.	Ɔde wɔn sii pon no so.
I don't know how to do that.	Minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ saa.
Time was running out.	Ná bere rekɔ so.
We seemed to be happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea yɛn ani agye.
My last name and first name mean nothing to me.	Me din a etwa to ne nea edi kan no nkyerɛ hwee mma me.
The other man seemed indifferent.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔbarima foforo no ani nnye obiara ho.
Even children feel that way.	Mmofra mpo te nka saa.
In good manners.	Wɔ su pa mu.
Just a few details about that.	Ɛno ho nsɛm kakraa bi pɛ.
If you think it surprises you.	Sɛ wususuw sɛ ɛyɛ wo nwonwa a.
I don’t like that idea at all.	M’ani nnye saa adwene no ho koraa.
That got his attention.	Ɛno maa n’adwene sii so.
Not that this makes it any easier.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ eyi ma ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Try to use it.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
But you know .	Nanso wunim .
So they tell me.	Enti wɔka kyerɛ me.
The plans fell through.	Nhyehyɛe ahorow no hwee ase.
Hopefully, he will be one.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ, ɔbɛyɛ biako.
Most of the kids raised their hands.	Mmofra dodow no ara maa wɔn nsa so.
I have to be like everyone else.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ sɛ obiara.
He was indeed a good man.	Na ɔyɛ onipa pa ampa.
He had to do something.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
One of us won in the end.	Yɛn mu biako dii nkonim wɔ awiei no.
And he didn’t know you knew.	Na na onnim sɛ wunim.
There was never any water.	Ná nsu biara nni hɔ da.
It’s not that long.	Ɛnyɛ tenten saa.
I have to say that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ.
Have fun with your friends.	Wo ne wo nnamfo gye w’ani.
He doesn’t like it.	N’ani nnye ho.
Many people used it.	Nnipa pii de dii dwuma.
There were pictures of me.	Ná me mfonini ahorow wɔ hɔ.
It might be a good thing.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ ade pa.
Too many problems.	Ɔhaw pii dodo.
So he had to be passive.	Enti na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ obi a ɔnyɛ hwee.
I'm so scared for him.	Me suro paa ma no.
This is their money.	Eyi ne wɔn sika.
Please don’t do that.	Mesrɛ wo, mma wonyɛ saa.
Now they are perfect.	Seesei wɔyɛ pɛ.
So, wish me happiness.	Enti, pɛ me anigye.
The story here is similar.	Asɛm a ɛwɔ ha no te saa ara.
That’s enough of a claim.	Ɛno ne asɛm a wɔka sɛ ɛdɔɔso.
Everything happened in a terrible way.	Biribiara sii wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu so.
Much more than that.	Pii sen saa.
That is what happened in this case.	Saa na esii wɔ asɛm yi mu.
But almost no one lives that way today.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara nni hɔ a ɔte ase saa nnɛ.
It becomes real after that.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa wɔ ɛno akyi.
One might want that to still work normally.	Ebia obi bɛpɛ sɛ ɛno da so ara yɛ adwuma sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He did something about it.	Ɔyɛɛ ho biribi.
It seemed more obvious now.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛda adi kɛse mprempren.
Something needs to be done about it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi.
I'd better tell you personally.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ mɛka akyerɛ wo ankasa.
However, I want to say this.	Nanso, mepɛ sɛ meka eyi.
Say it, everyone.	Ka no, obiara.
I don’t agree with him.	Me ne no nyɛ adwene.
That seems to have happened now.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno akɔ so mprempren.
I felt great about myself.	Metee nka kɛse wɔ me ho.
And he did a fantastic job.	Na ɔyɛɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Nor are they alone.	Saa ara nso na ɛnyɛ wɔn nkutoo.
I think my clothes would be fine too.	Misusuw sɛ anka me ntade nso bɛyɛ yiye.
That was the first time.	Ná ɛno ne bere a edi kan.
But it works really well.	Nanso ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
This should not be done.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi.
He did not know if his mother was still alive.	Ná onnim sɛ ebia ne maame da so te ase anaa.
Remember, everything you want, you already have and are.	Kae sɛ, biribiara a wopɛ no, wowɔ dedaw na wowɔ hɔ.
This is a big deal.	Eyi yɛ asɛm kɛse.
If you see it on the street, say something.	Sɛ wuhu wɔ abɔnten so a, ka biribi.
This feels like that.	Eyi te nka saa.
Every man seems to have a price.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔbarima biara wɔ bo bi.
Otherwise, he was actually quite nice.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, na ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
No one mentioned the matter.	Obiara anka asɛm no ho asɛm.
He wants a weekend at home.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ dapɛn awiei wɔ fie.
There was only a little bit left.	Na aka kakra bi pɛ na aka.
We have a job to do.	Yɛwɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
Just let it go!.	Ma no kɔ kɛkɛ!.
He may do some poor work.	Ebia ɔbɛyɛ adwuma bi a ɛnyɛ papa.
Very happy to be here.	Anigye kɛse sɛ mewɔ ha.
It’s not really that.	Ɛnte saa ankasa.
Most of them meant nothing to my children.	Ná wɔn mu dodow no ara nkyerɛ hwee mma me mma no.
All those people had to go somewhere.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ saa nkurɔfo no nyinaa kɔ baabi.
That’s the most important thing.	Ɛno ne nea ɛho hia sen biara.
There is only one problem.	Ɔhaw biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I still had a lot of them, in those days.	Na meda so ara wɔ wɔn pii, saa nna no mu.
Something else had to be done.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi foforo.
That was a great moment in the game.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere kɛse wɔ agoru no mu.
He was brilliant in this movie.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho akokwaw wɔ sini yi mu.
This is not a good idea.	Eyi nyɛ adwene pa.
He was a wonderful person.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
There is a.	Ɛwɔ hɔ.
It was in my nature.	Ná ɛwɔ me su mu.
Don’t let anyone tell you anything else.	Mma obiara nka biribi foforo biara nkyerɛ wo.
And the music, too.	Na nnwom no nso.
It’s a mistake.	Ɛyɛ mfomso.
Lunch and dinner are served daily.	Wɔde awia ne anwummere aduan ma da biara.
She is the beautiful one.	Ɔno ne nea ne ho yɛ fɛ no.
Is that what you want.	So ɛno ne nea wopɛ.
Start looking out there.	Fi ase hwɛ abɔnten hɔ.
It was a mistake.	Ná ɛyɛ mfomso.
It’s a wonderful bus route.	Ɛyɛ bɔs kwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
But they are not happy either.	Nanso wɔn nso ani nnye.
Get them both out of here.	Yi wɔn baanu nyinaa fi ha.
Many different things	Nneɛma ahorow pii
There was a man in your bedroom.	Ná ɔbarima bi wɔ wo mpa mu.
The transfer is temporary.	Nneɛma a wɔde kɔ baabi foforo no yɛ bere tiaa mu de.
To him, all people are equal.	Ɔno fam no, nnipa nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
Are you familiar with the plans?	So wunim nhyehyɛe ahorow no yiye?
It was in those days.	Ná ɛyɛ saa nna no mu.
But it was too late now.	Nanso na aka akyi dodo mprempren.
We need to get him somewhere as soon as possible.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde no kɔ baabi ntɛm ara sɛnea yebetumi.
I really can’t get enough.	Mintumi nnya nea ɛdɔɔso ankasa.
Not bad, just not good enough.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne, ɛnyɛ papa koraa kɛkɛ.
People know me.	Nkurɔfo nim me.
That’s what it is.	Ɛno ne nea ɛte.
It was a lot of it.	Ná ɛyɛ pii.
It has something else on it.	Ɛwɔ biribi foforo wɔ so.
The language is clear.	Kasa no mu da hɔ.
This was not the way.	Ná eyi nyɛ ɔkwan no.
I have to rescue him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye no.
There were still things he needed to do.	Ná nneɛma bi da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I can’t imagine the season without them.	Mintumi nsusuw bere no ho a wɔn nka ho.
Which was a thing.	Nea na ɛyɛ ade.
Everything you have in the house.	Biribiara a wowɔ wɔ fie hɔ.
But it all went well.	Nanso ne nyinaa kɔɔ so yiye.
That makes them good or bad.	Ɛno ma wɔyɛ papa anaa bɔne.
He made one for me.	Ɔyɛɛ bi de maa me.
Be careful with your stuff here.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ wo nneɛma ho wɔ ha.
This does not mean that there is no cost.	Eyi nkyerɛ sɛ ɛho ka biara nni hɔ.
Maybe he was really good.	Ebia na ɔyɛ papa ankasa.
He left the room with a sigh of relief.	Ɔde yaw a ɛyɛ yaw no fii dan no mu.
But still, it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ne nyinaa akyi no, ɛnyɛ hwee.
There is no danger in this.	Asiane a ɛwɔ eyi mu no nni hɔ.
Everything would be fine.	Anka biribiara bɛyɛ yiye.
But he did, however.	Nanso ɔno de, ɔyɛɛ saa.
All in all, it’s pretty cool.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
You can’t do this every two weeks.	Worentumi nyɛ eyi dapɛn abien biara.
And the next night, and the next.	Na anadwo a edi hɔ no, ne nea edi hɔ no nso.
Put your dad back on.	Fa wo papa san hyɛ no bio.
Just one thing to remember.	Ade biako pɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ wokae.
This had happened before.	Ná eyi asi pɛn.
There was no one there.	Ná obiara nni hɔ wɔ hɔ.
Think of our son.	Susuw yɛn ba no ho hwɛ.
On their own.	Wɔ wɔn ankasa so.
Most have some of the same things in common.	Dodow no ara wɔ nneɛma koro no ara bi a ɛyɛ pɛ.
So it was that way.	Enti na ɛte saa.
I see him.	Mihu no.
His head appears to be bowed in concentration.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne ti abɔ fam de ayɛ n’adwene.
Another better way.	Ɔkwan foforo a eye sen saa.
The girl was following the man.	Ná abeawa no di ɔbarima no akyi.
His words were inaccurate at best.	Ná ne nsɛm no nyɛ nokware wɔ nea eye sen biara mu.
He didn’t have time.	Ná onni bere.
But no one knew how to do anything about it.	Nanso na obiara nnim sɛnea ɔbɛyɛ ho biribi.
At least not anymore.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ saa bio.
The gun is not there.	Tuo no nni hɔ.
That’s not really the best idea.	Ɛno nyɛ adwene a eye sen biara ankasa.
That’s the case here.	Ɛte saa wɔ ha.
Nevertheless, there was still hope.	Ne nyinaa mu no, na anidaso da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Or maybe an existing professional.	Anaasɛ ebia obi a onim adwuma dedaw.
It’s a difficult issue.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ den.
This is something new for me.	Eyi yɛ ade foforo ma me.
For most people, that’s a long way off.	Wɔ nnipa dodow no ara fam no, ɛno yɛ ɔkwan tenten.
The children sleep well.	Mmofra no da yiye.
They were his ideas, not mine.	Ná wɔyɛ n’adwene, na ɛnyɛ me de.
Now is your time to be one.	Mprempren ne wo bere a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biako.
It was hard and he looked away from the window.	Ɛyɛ den na ɔde n’ani fii mfɛnsere no ho.
This may go well after all.	Ebia eyi bɛkɔ so yiye wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
The result is this.	Nea afi mu aba ne eyi.
However, there are a few exceptions though.	Nanso, nneɛma kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛnyɛ saa de.
You can always be better.	Wubetumi ayɛ papa bere nyinaa.
That’s what everyone is doing here.	Ɛno ne nea obiara reyɛ wɔ ha.
I have access to things now.	Mewɔ nneɛma ho kwan mprempren.
However, there were two points of view.	Nanso, na adwene wɔ nsɛm abien ho.
He was impressed with them.	N’ani gyee wɔn ho.
My children, for everyone.	Me mma, ma obiara.
No one told me that like you did.	Obiara anka ankyerɛ me saa te sɛ wo.
Everything goes back to normal after that.	Biribiara san kɔ sɛnea na ɛte kan no wɔ ɛno akyi.
Introduce yourself.	Fa wo ho kyerɛ.
He knew what they had to do.	Ná onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
However, this information is often lacking.	Nanso, mpɛn pii no, saa nsɛm yi nni hɔ.
But for dinner.	Nanso wɔ anwummere aduan ho.
It is very important that people recycle.	Ɛho hia yiye sɛ nkurɔfo san de nneɛma di dwuma bio.
This is the day of my first class of the year.	Eyi ne da a mekɔ adesua a edi kan wɔ afe no mu.
I have a story with him.	Me ne no abɔ asɛm bi.
, as you wish.	, sɛnea wopɛ.
Somehow, he was alive.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na ɔte ase.
There really isn’t much we can do.	Nneɛma pii nni hɔ ankasa a yebetumi ayɛ.
This is the work he has done for himself.	Eyi ne adwuma a wayɛ ama ne ho.
We have it, and we are here.	Yɛwɔ bi, na yɛwɔ ha.
I could have them back as much as I wanted.	Ná metumi anya wɔn bio sɛnea mepɛ.
It was hard for him to say.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma no sɛ ɔbɛka.
Which is just fine by me.	Nea ɛyɛ papa ara kwa wɔ me fam.
Everyone was impressed.	Obiara ani gyee ne ho.
Which I just disagree with.	Nea me ne no nyɛ adwene kɛkɛ.
He wanted another but he thought it through.	Ná ɔpɛ foforo nanso na osusuw ho yiye.
Two didn’t.	Baanu anyɛ saa.
Apparently you were too good for the downstairs dog bed.	Ɛda adi sɛ na woyɛ papa dodo ma kraman mpa a ɛwɔ fam no.
Even in the same room.	Wɔ dan koro no ara mu mpo.
I have no one to play with today.	Minni obi a me ne no bedi agoru nnɛ.
The tall man never says anything.	Ɔbarima tenten no nka hwee da.
Never say you’re not good enough.	Nka da sɛ wonyɛ papa.
Someone must have told you.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ obi aka akyerɛ wo.
In our time, the situation is quite clear.	Wɔ yɛn bere yi mu no, tebea no mu da hɔ koraa.
Whatever you think works.	Biribiara a wususuw sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
He is.	Ɔyɛ.
There is a lot going on in that time.	Nneɛma pii rekɔ so wɔ saa bere no mu.
He told us himself.	Ɔno ankasa na ɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn.
He did it himself, no one told him to.	Ɔno ankasa na ɔyɛɛ saa, obiara anka ankyerɛ no sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
It’s his last day.	Ɛyɛ ne da a etwa to.
This was just even more fun.	Eyi yɛɛ anigye kɛse mpo ara kwa.
No one can doubt this.	Obiara ntumi nnye eyi ho kyim.
That doesn’t mean there’s nothing to see here though.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ahu wɔ ha de, nanso.
He wanted to sleep too.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno nso da.
For school children.	Wɔde ma sukuu mmofra.
That’s all we can do.	Ɛno ara ne nea yebetumi ayɛ.
Everyone wants innovative businesses.	Obiara pɛ nnwuma a wɔyɛ nneɛma foforo.
But tell me this.	Nanso ka eyi kyerɛ me.
Isn’t there no one here but us right here.	So ɛnyɛ obiara nni ha gye yɛn wɔ ha yi ara.
I just wanted to check out the back room.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ akyi dan no mu ara kwa.
I think you’ll like it too.	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ho nso.
You’ll be surprised.	Ɛbɛyɛ wo nwonwa.
He wasn’t doing that anymore.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa bio.
He didn't want to want her.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔpɛ no.
That’s how the language began.	Saa na kasa fii ase.
Don’t touch it!	Mfa wo nsa nka!
That he shouldn’t talk to someone like that.	Sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔne obi kasa saa.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho.
This is a perfect team.	Eyi yɛ kuw a ɛyɛ pɛ.
I’d love to talk about this in more detail.	M’ani begye sɛ mɛka eyi ho asɛm akɔ akyiri.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani agye ho ankasa.
This hit home.	Eyi bɔɔ fie.
Expect to be surprised.	Hwɛ kwan sɛ ɛbɛyɛ wo nwonwa.
That night.	Saa anadwo no.
He doesn’t seem to know himself very well.	Ɛte sɛ nea onnim ne ho yiye.
You have to remember your name.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wokae wo din.
No one really knows what happened.	Obiara nnim nea esii ankasa.
I wonder what this outfit will eventually become.	Misusuw nea awiei koraa no saa atade yi bɛyɛ ho.
But there was no time then.	Nanso na bere nni hɔ saa bere no.
But it wasn’t good enough.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Your feedback is very important.	Wo nsɛm a wobɛka no ho hia yiye.
There was nothing in either of them.	Ná biribiara nni wɔn mu biara mu.
Things just can’t stay the same.	Nneɛma ntumi nkɔ so saa ara kɛkɛ.
Anyone else think this is a bad idea?.	Obi foforo bi susuw sɛ eyi yɛ adwene bɔne?.
Not with a gun to his head.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔde tuo abɔ ne ti.
It’s a wonderful idea, you know.	Ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa, wunim.
But it wasn’t necessary.	Nanso na ɛho nhia.
Often, this does not remain true only if one has done so.	Mpɛn pii no, sɛ obi ayɛ saa nkutoo a, eyi nkɔ so nyɛ nokware.
Time fell away then.	Bere hwee ase saa bere no.
I was very fond of him.	Ná m’ani gye ne ho kɛse.
He just shrugged.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ ne ho ara kwa.
There was little time to do anything.	Ná bere kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ biribi.
And it was so easy.	Na ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
Go running with this.	Kɔ tu mmirika ne eyi.
Many important events took place.	Nsɛm a ɛho hia pii sii.
He was such a big part of me.	Ná ɔyɛ me fã kɛse saa.
This has been in my head for the last few hours.	Eyi ayɛ me ti wɔ nnɔnhwerew kakraa a atwam no mu.
Still, it was fun.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ anigye.
This is not our opinion.	Eyi nyɛ yɛn adwene.
Maybe this is what the end of the year should be full of.	Ebia eyi ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ afe no awiei yɛ ma.
Children are honest.	Mmofra di nokware.
Are you sure you want to do that?	So wugye di sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ saa?
The painting looked very old.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea mfonini no akyɛ yiye.
It was a necessary evil.	Ná ɛyɛ bɔne a ɛho hia.
Usually afterwards.	Mpɛn pii no akyi no.
You’ve got to look at it.	Wo deɛ hwɛ.
But that doesn’t matter a bit.	Nanso ɛno mfa ho kakra.
Maybe next year.	Ebia afe a edi hɔ no.
I have two new things for you.	Mewɔ nneɛma foforo abien ma wo.
You never forget.	Wo werɛ mfi da.
I had planned to do it tonight.	Ná mayɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mɛyɛ no anadwo yi.
Neither of them could go very far.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa ntumi nkɔ akyiri koraa.
This party is going great!	Saa apontow yi rekɔ so yiye!
We all need to be actively involved.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa de yɛn ho hyɛ mu denneennen.
You were quite young.	Ná woyɛ abofra koraa.
I heard about him.	Metee ne ho asɛm.
This was the picture he wanted to show her.	Eyi ne mfonini a na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde kyerɛ no.
The most beautiful idea.	Adwene a ɛyɛ fɛ sen biara.
He was a master of the art.	Ná ne ho akokwaw.
It’s an arrangement that works well for both of us.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe a ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ma yɛn baanu nyinaa.
He was planning something.	Ná ɔreyɛ biribi ho nhyehyɛe.
So full of joy.	Enti anigye ahyɛ no ma.
Somewhere on the edge of town.	Wɔ kurow no ano baabi.
He knew what that meant.	Ná onim nea ɛno kyerɛ.
The best of his time.	Nea eye sen biara wɔ ne bere so.
To us, that sounds easy.	Wɔ yɛn fam no, ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Put it aside and live with it.	Fa to nkyɛn na fa tra ase.
The system worked well.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛɛ adwuma yiye.
That was hot.	Ná ɛno yɛ hyew.
Don’t go too far.	Mma nkɔ akyiri.
I feel you.	Mete wo nka.
Don’t say that now.	Nka saa seesei.
I thought you were right there.	Misusuwii sɛ wowɔ hɔ ara.
It’s not that pretty.	Ɛnyɛ fɛ saa.
There are only three of them.	Wɔn mu abiɛsa pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
You’re interested in him.	W’ani gye ne ho.
It was a slow motion.	Ná ɛte saa.
I think there are two things here.	Misusuw sɛ nneɛma abien bi wɔ ha.
I really don’t want to know.	Ankasa, mempɛ sɛ mihu.
Even bad things.	Nneɛma bɔne mpo.
You get along with him.	Wo ne no di yiye.
It was still there.	Ná ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
He gave her the book.	Ɔde nhoma no maa no.
However, I don’t know what they are.	Nanso, minnim nea wɔyɛ.
This project seemed to be well received.	Ɛte sɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gyee saa adwuma yi ho yiye.
His hands became weak.	Ne nsa yɛɛ mmerɛw.
That’s what you do.	Ɛno mu na woyɛ.
There were many people there.	Ná nnipa pii wɔ hɔ.
They were very strange and harmless.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa yiye na asiane biara nni wɔn ho.
Face to face, it was good.	Anim ne anim no, na eye.
I wish they talked about it more.	Me yam a anka wɔka ho asɛm pii.
He was fascinated by her.	Ná n’ani gye ne ho.
I'm not doing too well today.	Menyɛ yiye dodo nnɛ.
That means nothing goes inside.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ biribiara nkɔ mu.
The accident happened on a busy town road.	Akwanhyia no sii wɔ kurow no kwan a nnipa pii fa so no so.
They were the same thing.	Na wɔyɛ ade koro.
But at least you can get your foot in the door.	Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no, wubetumi de wo nan ahyɛ ɔpon no mu.
There are no species of life.	Nkwa ahorow biara nni hɔ.
We can’t be late for school.	Yɛrentumi nka akyi mma sukuu.
So that’s really exciting.	Enti ɛno yɛ anigye ankasa.
I believe this is one of the first.	Migye di sɛ eyi yɛ nea edi kan no mu biako.
But he has done the same.	Nanso wayɛ saa ara.
He didn't know what to say.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛka.
But tonight his time was short.	Nanso anadwo yi na ne bere ayɛ tiaa.
Nor was the man anywhere else in the room.	Saa ara nso na na ɔbarima no nni baabi foforo biara wɔ dan no mu.
It wasn’t that long ago.	Ná ɛnyɛ bere tenten ni saa.
You have to put in the work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode adwuma no hyɛ mu.
It must be a licensing issue.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ tumi krataa ho asɛm.
They had to do what they had to do.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
There is no such thing.	Biribi a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ.
Keep the thing going.	Ma ade no nkɔ so.
Look at those two people.	Hwɛ saa nnipa baanu no.
No one could find out about it.	Obiara antumi anhu ho asɛm.
At least it seemed that way.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
But you shouldn’t be bothered by what we do.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ nea yɛyɛ no haw mo.
You are just like your father.	Wo te sɛ wo papa ara pɛ.
I tell myself that things are not what they are.	Meka kyerɛ me ho sɛ nneɛma nyɛ nea ɛte.
None of us know ourselves.	Yɛn mu biara nnim ne ho.
It is in popular books.	Ɛwɔ nhoma ahorow a agye din mu.
He used her in this way for two years.	Ɔde no dii dwuma saa kwan yi so mfe abien.
In the end, one of them could not attend.	Awiei no, wɔn mu biako antumi ankɔ.
Everyone wants to succeed.	Obiara pɛ sɛ odi yiye.
It was enough.	Ná ɛdɔɔso.
Nothing good can come of it.	Biribi pa biara ntumi mfi mu mma.
You can see that on film with relative ease.	Wubetumi ahu saa wɔ sini so a ɛnyɛ den koraa.
First, understand how it works.	Nea edi kan no, te sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma no ase.
It’s one of my favorite things to do.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma a m’ani gye ho paa sɛ mɛyɛ no mu biako.
That’s simply not true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware kɛkɛ.
It’s too hard for some businesses.	Ɛyɛ den dodo ma nnwuma bi.
It almost seems like that happened today.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛno sii nnɛ.
I do love the book.	M’ani gye nhoma no ho ampa.
Wine was cheap.	Ná nsa bo nyɛ den.
That was pretty cool.	Ná ɛno yɛ fɛ yiye.
It’s like this.	Ɛte sɛ eyi.
It was very difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den yiye.
The book will become different things over time.	Nhoma no bɛyɛ nneɛma ahorow bere a bere kɔ so no.
If you do, I’ll be very happy.	Sɛ woyɛ saa a, m’ani begye kɛse.
He is such a good person.	Ɔyɛ onipa pa a ɔte saa.
His hair was ugly.	Ná ne ti nhwi nyɛ fɛ.
I need to feel at home.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete nka sɛ mewɔ fie.
I'm with you there.	Me ne wo wɔ hɔ.
How much money do you have?	Sika ahe na wowɔ?
So you end up with problems.	Enti wode ɔhaw ahorow ba awiei.
How are you doing this time too.	Saa bere yi nso wo ho te dɛn.
I like his wife better.	M’ani gye ne yere ho sen saa.
No one was hearing a word.	Ná obiara nte asɛm biara.
We have to be on him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ne so.
I want it all, please.	Mepɛ ne nyinaa, mesrɛ wo.
So it’s absolutely essential.	Enti ɛho hia koraa.
Go girl.	Kɔ abeawa.
But the story kept making money.	Nanso asɛm no kɔɔ so yɛɛ sika.
The crisis was over.	Ná ɔhaw no aba awiei.
It was as if someone else had arrived.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obi foforo aba hɔ.
He needs to be with her now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne no wɔ hɔ mprempren.
It was an exciting time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ anigye.
The animal tells me what it wants me to know.	Aboa no ka nea ɔpɛ sɛ mihu kyerɛ me.
So you will definitely be happy.	Enti akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ w’ani begye.
This doesn’t work.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
I thought everything was great fun.	Misusuwii sɛ biribiara yɛ anigye kɛse.
They always say they are innocent.	Wɔka bere nyinaa sɛ wɔn ho nni asɛm.
There was plenty of room for everything.	Ná baabi pii wɔ hɔ ma biribiara.
Most of your time during the day is spent thinking quickly.	Wo bere dodow no ara wɔ awia no mu no, wode susuw nneɛma ho ntɛmntɛm.
But it’s not that complicated.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den saa.
It was just his head and he put it there.	Ɛyɛ ne ti ara kwa na ɔde too hɔ.
He didn't know what he was doing.	Ná onnim nea ɔyɛ.
Happiness has power.	Anigye wɔ tumi.
I really wanted to go with him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne no kɔ ankasa.
One chance, maybe.	Hokwan biako, ebia.
Happy here so far.	Anigye wɔ ha de besi ha.
This trend continues over the years.	Saa su yi kɔ so wɔ mfe no mu.
I was the only one there.	Ná me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ.
But he already knew.	Nanso na onim dedaw.
This is very important.	Eyi ho hia paa.
Keep it up.	Fa kɔ so.
He hoped it would.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Add some to it.	Fa bi ka ho.
Anyone could do this.	Ná obiara betumi ayɛ eyi.
Just remember how good it was.	Kae sɛnea na eye no ara kwa.
There weren’t many cars.	Ná kar pii nni hɔ.
There were two problems with that.	Ná ɔhaw abien wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
That’s what the books don’t say.	Ɛno ne nea nhoma ahorow no nka.
I am half and half.	Meyɛ fã ne fã.
That goes for everyone else too.	Ɛno kɔ ma obiara a aka nso.
It wasn’t a big room.	Ná ɛnyɛ dan kɛse bi.
The general story follows in the same vein.	Asɛm a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa no di akyi wɔ ɔkwan koro no ara so.
Without it, you wouldn’t be able to drive your car.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ saa a, anka worentumi nka wo kar no.
The same goes for your mortgage.	Saa ara na wo dan ka no nso te.
It still doesn’t work.	Ɛda so ara nyɛ adwuma.
Once, someone saw me.	Bere bi, obi huu me.
Or if you are worried about something.	Anaasɛ sɛ biribi haw wo a.
Who was it that was.	Ná ɛyɛ hena.
I want to talk to him.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa.
Mentally it’s just hard to do.	Adwene mu no ɛyɛ den ara kwa sɛ wobɛyɛ.
You can enter as many times as you like.	Wubetumi akɔ mu mpɛn dodow biara a wopɛ.
This is done by the mind of the beast.	Aboa no adwene na ɛyɛ eyi.
We have to do the work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma no.
This makes the system complex and expensive.	Eyi ma nhyehyɛe no yɛ den na ne bo yɛ den.
It’s easy for him to fill.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw ma no ma.
But there was someone in the background.	Nanso na obi wɔ hɔ wɔ akyi hɔ.
That approach doesn’t work.	Saa kwan no ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
However, not everyone is.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ obiara na ɛte saa.
How people see you is how people see you.	Sɛnea nkurɔfo hu wo no ne sɛnea nkurɔfo hu wo.
That should have made me happy, but it didn’t.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ma m’ani gye, nanso anyɛ saa.
He didn't know why he would do such a thing.	Ná onnim nea enti a ɔbɛyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
I don’t know anymore.	Minnim bio.
I am sure there are many.	Migye di sɛ pii wɔ hɔ.
They can both go.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa betumi akɔ.
This article explains why.	Saa asɛm yi kyerɛ nea enti a ɛte saa.
It wasn’t any good.	Ná ɛnyɛ papa biara.
However, this was only the case for some of the trials.	Nanso, na eyi te saa wɔ sɔhwɛ ahorow no bi nkutoo mu.
It was a great picture.	Ná ɛyɛ mfonini kɛse bi.
I feel bad for him.	Mete nka bɔne ma no.
The boy looked up.	Abarimaa no maa n’ani so.
It was the morning.	Ná ɛyɛ anɔpa.
My name is no longer my name.	Me din nyɛ me din bio.
Everyone started moving.	Obiara fii ase tu.
Dan has adopted two children.	Dan agye mma baanu sɛ ne ba.
Simple but quite powerful.	Ɛnyɛ den nanso tumi wom koraa.
He never does that.	Ɔnyɛ saa da.
However, he was watching me.	Nanso, na n’ani da me so.
Or serve as a nice side dish.	Anaasɛ fa ma sɛ aduan a wɔde ka ho a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Most of these species are now endangered.	Mprempren saa mmoa ahorow yi mu dodow no ara wɔ asiane mu.
How loud everything seemed.	Hwɛ sɛnea na biribiara te sɛ nea ano yɛ den.
The numbers are certainly high.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ dodow no yɛ kɛse.
So for me, being strong is the most appealing.	Enti wɔ me fam no, sɛ́ obi bɛyɛ den no ne nea ɛyɛ anigye sen biara.
Buses are such a problem.	Bɔs ahorow yɛ ɔhaw a ɛte saa.
They say he had a face.	Wɔka sɛ na ɔwɔ anim.
He was a handsome man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
This is again true in this case.	Eyi yɛ nokware bio wɔ asɛm yi mu.
But still, he has done it.	Nanso ɛda so ara, wayɛ.
But we have many schools.	Nanso yɛwɔ sukuu ahorow pii.
He always did this so quickly.	Ná ɔyɛ eyi ntɛmntɛm saa bere nyinaa.
On the floor.	Wɔ fam hɔ.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnte saa.
That surprised me.	Ɛno yɛɛ me nwonwa.
My hands would hurt badly.	Ná me nsa bɛyɛ me yaw kɛse.
It’s still small, but it’s happening.	Ɛda so ara yɛ kakraa bi, nanso ɛrekɔ so.
The first highway is now a back road.	Mprempren ɔkwan kɛse a edi kan no yɛ akyi kwan.
His clothes are terrible.	Ne ntade yɛ hu.
He had forgotten all about it.	Ná ne werɛ afi ne nyinaa.
I still remember what he looked like.	Meda so ara kae sɛnea na ɔte no.
So do many of my friends.	Saa ara na me nnamfo pii nso te.
It doesn’t really matter.	Ɛho nhia ankasa.
People use it for both good and evil.	Nkurɔfo de yɛ papa ne bɔne nyinaa.
I thought she was just a girl.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔyɛ abeawa bi kɛkɛ.
He was there today.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ nnɛ.
The focus seemed to be on one of the other teams.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔde wɔn adwene asi kuw foforo no mu biako so.
I know he’d love to take you there.	Minim sɛ n’ani begye ho sɛ ɔde wo bɛkɔ hɔ.
The walk was obviously hard.	Ɛda adi sɛ na nantew no yɛ den.
Man on this subject.	Onipa wɔ saa asɛm yi ho.
This is not a terrible thing.	Eyi nyɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu.
I couldn’t do that to them.	Na mintumi nyɛ wɔn saa.
I know how fast he is.	Minim sɛnea ɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
We do our words.	Yɛyɛ yɛn nsɛm.
That’s what you see.	Ɛno ne nea wuhu.
You shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I think this will be the best new thing for him.	Misusuw sɛ eyi bɛyɛ ade foforo a eye sen biara ama no.
I want to say something here.	Mepɛ sɛ meka biribi wɔ ha.
Another old job.	Adwuma dedaw foforo.
Food is prepared for him as humans are prepared for him.	Wɔyɛ aduan ma no sɛnea nnipa yɛ aduan ma no no.
These books are essential for the entrance exams.	Saa nhoma ahorow yi ho hia ma sɔhwɛ ahorow a wɔde kɔ sukuu no mu.
Nothing was certain.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nokware.
I was his animal.	Ná meyɛ ne aboa.
So many times.	Enti mpɛn pii.
It wasn’t a thing.	Ná ɛnyɛ hwee.
Do it your way.	Yɛ no wo kwan so.
That hurt my feelings.	Ɛno ho yɛɛ me yaw.
None of these statements are helpful here.	Nsɛm yi mu biara mmoa wɔ ha.
He’s very passionate about animals.	N’ani agye mmoa ho kɛse.
You and my mom can start planning.	Wo ne me maame betumi afi ase ayɛ nhyehyɛe.
Which must have been good.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na eye.
Have a dog sleep next to you.	Ma ɔkraman bi da wo nkyɛn.
But, tell me.	Nanso, ka kyerɛ me.
It is incredibly difficult.	Ɛyɛ den ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I guess he just didn't know any better.	Misusuw sɛ na onnim nea eye sen saa ara kwa.
However, we will do our best.	Nanso, yɛbɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara.
But many remain the same.	Nanso pii da so ara wɔ hɔ sɛnea ɛte no ara.
Maybe it will be.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I loved everything about it.	M’ani gyee ho biribiara ho.
The child was in critical condition.	Ná abofra no tebea yɛ hu.
After hours it wasn’t much better.	Nnɔnhwerew akyi no na ɛnyɛ papa pii.
A good name is everything!.	Din pa ne biribiara!.
But that’s why some stories never happen.	Nanso ɛno nti na nsɛm bi mma da.
A lot of people are in way over their heads.	Nnipa pii wɔ kwan so wɔ wɔn ti so.
If possible, you want it.	Sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye a, wopɛ.
If he had his father's gun.	Sɛ ɔwɔ ne papa tuo no a.
It’s an idea.	Ɛyɛ adwene bi.
Two books of pictures should be on display.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde mfonini ahorow nhoma abien kyerɛ.
John started to protest, but his father shot him.	John fii ase kasa tiaa no, nanso ne papa too no tuo.
It was never like that.	Ná ɛnte saa da.
The rest have nothing.	Wɔn a aka no nni hwee.
And not for the first time.	Na ɛnyɛ nea edi kan koraa.
This was a little strange.	Ná eyi yɛ nwonwa kakra.
He was her favorite.	Ná ɔno ne obi a n’ani gye ne ho paa.
The best picture in each language wins.	Mfonini a eye sen biara wɔ kasa biara mu na edi nkonim.
But he wasn’t alone.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo.
Perhaps for now.	Ebia mprempren de.
I want to be the man.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ɔbarima no.
It didn't matter why.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea enti a ɛte saa no ho asɛm.
Do it fast, too.	Yɛ no ntɛmntɛm, nso.
We had one priority.	Ná yɛwɔ ade biako a edi kan.
I didn’t really have time, though.	Nanso, na minni bere ankasa.
The leather should be soft and supple.	Ɛsɛ sɛ aboa nhoma no yɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Things couldn’t go that way.	Nneɛma antumi ankɔ so saa.
But he doesn’t want me.	Nanso ɔmpɛ me.
They are interested in children.	Wɔn ani gye mmofra ho.
This comes to an end.	Eyi ba awiei.
No one said that it was.	Obiara anka sɛ ɛte saa.
I am incredibly sore.	Meyɛ no yaw a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
People do that.	Nkurɔfo yɛ saa.
What’s next.	Dɛn na edi hɔ.
But that is a mistake.	Nanso ɛno yɛ mfomso.
The study attempts to	Adesua no bɔ mmɔden sɛ
His eyes were on hers.	Ná n’ani da ne de so.
I will provide pictures as best I can.	Mede mfonini ahorow bɛma sɛnea metumi biara.
He was obviously excited about this.	Ɛda adi sɛ na n’ani agye eyi ho.
However, that is not their only problem.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo ne wɔn haw.
You know what that would be like.	Wunim sɛnea anka ɛno bɛyɛ.
Not that there are many cars.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ kar pii wɔ hɔ.
Nothing comes from there.	Biribiara mfi hɔ mma.
But there is nothing.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ.
After that first month, though, it’s easy.	Nanso, wɔ saa ɔsram a edi kan no akyi no, ɛnyɛ den.
It was a talking point from then on. 	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a obiara ka fi saa bere no. 
This is not the only one.	Ɛnyɛ eyi nkutoo.
That is a huge problem.	Ɛno yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
He was doing what my friends were doing.	Ná ɔreyɛ nea me nnamfo yɛ no.
This test is too difficult.	Saa sɔhwɛ yi yɛ den dodo.
He has something.	Ɔwɔ biribi.
I know about several.	Minim dodow bi ho asɛm.
Take it as soon as you can.	Fa ntɛm ara sɛnea wubetumi.
His father knew.	Ná ne papa nim.
And this brings us to a couple of interesting things.	Na eyi de yɛn ba nneɛma abien bi a ɛyɛ anigye so.
He might do anything.	Ebia ɔbɛyɛ biribiara.
We are just friends.	Yɛyɛ nnamfo ara kwa.
They posed for pictures.	Wɔde wɔn ho too wɔn ho so maa mfonini ahorow.
He was no help.	Ná ɔnyɛ mmoa biara.
He is not as good as he used to be.	Ɔnyɛ papa te sɛ kan no.
Tomorrow would come.	Ná ɔkyena bɛba.
Often, though, that is not necessarily the case.	Nanso, mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ nea ɛte saa ankasa.
Years later, people come back to this problem.	Mfe pii akyi no, nkurɔfo san ba ɔhaw yi ho.
There was a reason for that.	Ná biribi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
It was a terrible, terrible day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ hu, na ɛyɛ hu.
He patted the dog on the head.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ɔkraman no ti.
My father didn’t see me.	Me papa anhu me.
I can see it now.	Metumi ahu no mprempren.
That girl feared for her life.	Saa abeawa no suro ne nkwa.
What day was it? 	Ná ɛyɛ da bɛn?
I don’t think he even knows.	Minsusuw sɛ onim mpo.
And finally, he ended the speech.	Na awiei koraa no, ɔde kasa no baa awiei.
Or at least that’s what their prices seem to indicate.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne nea ɛte sɛ nea wɔn nneɛma bo kyerɛ.
But that’s what you like about it.	Nanso ɛno ne nea w’ani gye ho wɔ ho.
They are relatively new to the story.	Wɔyɛ foforo koraa wɔ asɛm no mu.
That’s what you said.	Ɛno ne nea wokae.
That’s the reason for it.	Ɛno ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
But he had nothing to do.	Nanso na onni biribiara a ɔbɛyɛ.
The first shot fell.	Tuo a edi kan no hwee ase.
How good and strong it is.	Hwɛ sɛnea eye na ɛyɛ den no.
Here are some of our publications.	Yɛn nhoma ahorow no bi ni.
There were many different types of clothes.	Ná ntade ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
Anyone can see that.	Obiara betumi ahu saa.
This is your school.	Eyi ne mo sukuu.
You probably know about me.	Ebia wunim me ho asɛm.
Over the years.	Mfe pii a atwam no.
It was wet after all.	Na ɛyɛ nsu wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
That’s a good quality.	Ɛno yɛ su pa.
A whole year had passed.	Ná afe mũ nyinaa atwam.
A few pictures.	Mfonini kakraa bi.
We can help you with this.	Yebetumi de eyi aboa wo.
He decided to tell the truth.	Ɔyɛɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛka nokware.
Maybe he wasn’t really my father.	Ebia na ɔnyɛ me papa ankasa.
I think people will enjoy it.	Misusuw sɛ nkurɔfo ani begye ho.
But they are worse than that.	Nanso wɔyɛ bɔne sen saa.
Use it at home as well.	Fa di dwuma wɔ fie nso.
They are much stronger today.	Wɔyɛ den kɛse nnɛ.
Insert it into the system.	Fa hyɛ nhyehyɛe no mu.
At least he thought he had.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na osusuw sɛ wayɛ saa.
Say that and be a man.	Ka saa na yɛ ɔbarima.
I really don’t like this man.	M’ani nnye ɔbarima yi ho ankasa.
There are many different types.	Ahorow ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
Even the best plumbing systems can malfunction.	Nsu a wɔde fa nsu mu a eye sen biara mpo betumi anyɛ adwuma yiye.
He knew from her.	Ná onim fi ne hɔ.
The rest is pretty much the same.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nea aka no yɛ pɛ.
It’s going to something.	Ɛrekɔ biribi ho.
To me that’s more of the point.	Me fam no ɛno ne nea ɛwɔ asɛm no mu kɛse.
That’s hardly the only issue.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo ne asɛm no.
That view is completely wrong.	Saa adwene no yɛ mfomso koraa.
He had only one leg, one arm.	Ná ɔwɔ nan biako pɛ, ne nsa biako.
This road is in a terrible state.	Saa kwan yi wɔ tebea a ɛyɛ hu mu.
People know each other by name.	Nkurɔfo de wɔn din nim wɔn ho wɔn ho.
Everything was the same in every case.	Ná biribiara yɛ pɛ wɔ asɛm biara mu.
But there is no one else.	Nanso obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
Anyway, something else began to happen.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, biribi foforo fii ase sii.
Maybe you do see the past.	Ebia wuhu nneɛma a atwam no ampa.
The sleepless street.	Abɔnten a na nna nni hɔ no.
It’s not good enough.	Ɛnyɛ yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
You are truly amazing.	Woyɛ nwonwa ampa.
He glanced out the window.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
Apparently, he didn't seem to do much.	Ɛda adi sɛ, na ɛte sɛ nea ɔnyɛ hwee pii.
I really wish he was here.	Me yam a anka ɔwɔ ha ankasa.
Maybe it’s something else.	Ebia ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
We have friends.	Yɛwɔ nnamfo.
I know it will be.	Minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
. . . .	.
That is why we put the children of our species in schools.	Ɛno nti na yɛde yɛn su no mma to sukuu ahorow mu no.
The man obviously couldn’t help it.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔbarima no antumi anyɛ ho hwee.
And, there will be more.	Na, pii bɛba.
I was very popular in school.	Ná nkurɔfo ani gye me ho yiye wɔ sukuu mu.
But this water.	Nanso saa nsu yi.
He does it right.	Ɔyɛ no yiye.
I just have the power.	Mewɔ tumi no ara kwa.
He lives in a beautiful house.	Ɔte ofie bi a ɛyɛ fɛ mu.
I think it’s too dangerous.	Misusuw sɛ asiane wom dodo.
I have used water.	Mede nsu adi dwuma.
He was such a person.	Ná ɔno ne obi a ɔte saa.
That’s how you are.	Ɛte saa na wo.
It’s just music.	Ɛyɛ nnwom ara kwa.
I even use it under my eyes.	Mede di dwuma mpo wɔ m’ani ase.
He seemed to lose interest in what he was doing.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani nnye nea ɔreyɛ no ho bio.
He wanted things to go the way they were.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ nneɛma kɔ so sɛnea ɛte no.
He loved that book.	Ná n’ani gye saa nhoma no ho.
A new language is needed to describe him.	Ɛho hia sɛ wɔka kasa foforo a wɔde bɛka ne ho asɛm.
And each of them.	Ne wɔn mu biara.
I don’t have time to argue.	Minni bere a mede begye akyinnye.
I was doing that.	Ná mereyɛ saa.
And	Ne
Just then, his eyes went back to his head.	Saa bere no ara, n’ani san kɔɔ ne ti so.
I was happy for them.	Ná m’ani agye ama wɔn.
The city was famous for its literature.	Ná kurow no agye din wɔ nhoma ahorow a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho.
Does his style surprise you?	So sɛnea ɔka nsɛm no yɛ nwonwa ma wo?
I might take it to my car as well.	Ebia mede bɛkɔ me kar mu nso.
Here you go!.	Ha na wo kɔ!.
He thinks he has no power.	Osusuw sɛ onni tumi.
It just seems a little complicated to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den kakra kɛkɛ ma me.
I didn’t want to go.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mekɔ.
It’s almost the same.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte saa ara.
I found at least three.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, mihuu abiɛsa.
We actually do something about it.	Yɛyɛ ho biribi ankasa.
Are you happy with the food?	So w’ani agye wɔ aduan no ho?
The strange story captured the attention of the people.	Asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa no gyee nkurɔfo adwene.
But he had no other.	Nanso na onni foforo biara.
We are not alone in this.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn nkutoo na yɛyɛ saa.
We can solve the problems with minimal cost.	Yebetumi de ka kakraa bi adi ɔhaw ahorow no ho dwuma.
He was our son.	Ná ɔyɛ yɛn ba.
He had no plans now.	Ná onni nhyehyɛe biara mprempren.
A really nice piece of work.	Adwuma a ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
They are true to themselves.	Wɔyɛ nokware ma wɔn ho.
I hit him really hard.	Mede no bɔɔ denneennen ankasa.
Make a wonderful hand.	Yɛ nsa a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
You can forget about it.	Wubetumi ama wo werɛ afi.
This has certainly produced results in the past.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi ama nea afi mu aba wɔ bere a atwam no mu.
Or so it was.	Anaasɛ, saa na na ɛte.
Do I get my head in it.	So me ti hyɛ mu.
Someone is knocking on the door.	Obi rebɔ ɔpon no mu.
Take everything.	Fa biribiara so.
All your friends will be there.	Wo nnamfo nyinaa bɛba hɔ.
But it has worked well for me.	Nanso ayɛ adwuma yiye ama me.
That’s how things are.	Saa na nneɛma te.
That in itself will certainly cause problems.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno ankasa de ɔhaw bɛba.
Everything comes to an end.	Biribiara ba awiei.
It doesn’t have to be terribly difficult.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den a ɛyɛ hu.
Therefore, diversity in what each system offers becomes important.	Enti, nneɛma ahorow a ɛwɔ nea nhyehyɛe biara de ma mu no bɛyɛ nea ɛho hia.
And it had worked.	Na na ayɛ adwuma.
Think about what you want.	Susuw nea wopɛ ho.
You know, it was a big mistake.	Wunim, na ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
He doesn't, he hasn't for too long.	Ɔnyɛ, ɔnyɛ saa bere tenten dodo.
This will be done as soon as the meeting begins.	Yɛbɛyɛ eyi bere a nhyiam no afi ase ara pɛ.
Everything is up to date.	Biribiara yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ nnɛ.
There were no windows.	Ná mfɛnsere nni mu.
This is a good one.	Eyi yɛ nea eye.
There is absolutely no problem with this.	Ɔhaw biara nni eyi ho koraa.
I want to be the only person who can have it.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ onipa nkutoo a obetumi anya bi.
The same concept will be used here.	Wɔde adwene koro no ara bedi dwuma wɔ ha.
He is a strong character.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ den.
Everyone sitting at his feet.	Obiara a ɔte ne nan ase.
You know many of the people.	Wunim nnipa no mu pii.
So that’s not the problem.	Enti ɛnyɛ ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
We’ll all be there.	Yɛn nyinaa bɛba hɔ.
That might still be possible.	Ebia na ɛno da so ara betumi ayɛ yiye.
One of us had to go.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn mu biako kɔ.
This is perfect timing.	Eyi yɛ bere a edi mũ.
We picture you on the floor.	Yɛyɛ wo ho mfonini wɔ fam.
He liked most people.	Ná n’ani gye nnipa dodow no ara ho.
I can’t tell you to do this.	Mintumi nka nkyerɛ wo sɛ yɛ eyi.
The rest of the day was kind of a blur.	Ná da no fã a aka no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu bi.
I had a very nice house.	Ná mewɔ ofie a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He is the strong man in the house.	Ɔno ne ɔbarima a ɔyɛ den wɔ fie hɔ.
Everyone surprised me, except him.	Obiara yɛɛ me nwonwa, gye ɔno nkutoo.
But he was too good for everyone.	Nanso na ɔyɛ papa dodo ma obiara.
Maybe it just matters to me and it doesn’t really matter otherwise.	Ebia ɛho hia me ara kwa na ɛho nhia ankasa sɛ ɛnte saa.
Don’t go home to some.	Mma nkɔ fie kɔ bi so.
It’s amazing today.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa nnɛ.
It wasn’t working.	Ná ɛnyɛ adwuma.
There is no doubt about how good this dish is.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ sɛnea saa aduan yi yɛ papa.
That was just his way.	Ná ɛno yɛ ne kwan ara kwa.
That’s the other team.	Ɛno ne kuw foforo no.
The story gave his day.	Asɛm no maa ne da.
He would absolutely do that.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ saa koraa.
Whatever you do, do it with joy.	Biribiara a wobɛyɛ no, fa anigye yɛ.
He does it when the team needs it.	Ɔyɛ no bere a kuw no hia no.
I knew it was safe.	Ná minim sɛ asiane biara nni ho.
It’s not the whole thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade no nyinaa.
Mine is not such a case.	Me de no nyɛ asɛm a ɛte saa.
Many people saw the accident.	Nnipa pii huu akwanhyia no.
The picture looks like us!	Mfonini no te sɛ yɛn!
There are two reasons behind it.	Nneɛma abien na ɛwɔ akyi.
There must be a mistake.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mfomso bi wɔ hɔ.
He loved the picture.	Ná n’ani gye mfonini no ho.
We loved the house.	Ná yɛn ani gye ofie no ho.
There was the head, and there were the hands.	Na ti no wɔ hɔ, na nsa nso wɔ hɔ.
Things would never be quite the same.	Ná nneɛma bɛyɛ sɛnea na ɛte no koraa da.
You can do that part, if you want.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa fã no, sɛ wopɛ a.
Why is it so slow.	Dɛn nti na ɛte saa.
So, here’s my opinion.	Enti, m’adwene ni.
It is very obvious.	Ɛda adi kɛse.
His condition was difficult.	Ná ne tebea yɛ den.
I have done my best to decide what is going on.	Mayɛ nea metumi biara de asi nea ɛrekɔ so ho gyinae.
Or so it would seem.	Anaasɛ ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛte saa.
They even used it against their own people.	Wɔde dii dwuma mpo tiaa wɔn ankasa nkurɔfo.
I couldn’t even tell if it was a boy or a girl.	Na mintumi nhu mpo sɛ ɛyɛ abarimaa anaa abeawa.
I was strong enough.	Ná me ho yɛ den.
The latter group is now the most common.	Mprempren kuw a etwa to no na abu so sen biara.
The food is great.	Aduan no yɛ kɛse.
Always late in the game.	Bere nyinaa ka akyi wɔ agoru no mu.
You just become more of yourself.	Wobɛyɛ wo ho kɛse ara kwa.
Two of you are my son.	Mo mu baanu ne me ba.
He told me we could go on our way.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ yebetumi akɔ yɛn kwan so.
Their cars are too fast!	Wɔn kar ahorow no tu mmirika dodo!
His very life was in danger.	Ná ne nkwa ankasa da asiane mu.
Put your trust in him.	Fa wo ho to ne so.
That is our fault.	Ɛno ne yɛn mfomso.
I hope they did too.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wɔn nso yɛɛ saa.
I found it here.	Mihuu no wɔ ha.
We all know the movie is fake.	Yɛn nyinaa nim sɛ sini no yɛ atoro.
It’s not just here.	Ɛnyɛ ha ara kwa.
You can actually do it.	Wubetumi ayɛ no ankasa.
I am doing very well.	Mereyɛ yiye paa.
However, this is part of the story.	Nanso, eyi ka asɛm no ho.
All would be well now.	Anka ne nyinaa bɛyɛ yiye mprempren.
We all need to give this our backs.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa de yɛn akyi ma eyi.
I'm sure both will be great.	Migye di sɛ abien no nyinaa bɛyɛ kɛse.
You want to know more.	Wopɛ sɛ wuhu pii.
He slid his hands down.	Ɔde ne nsa too fam.
This is an interesting book.	Eyi yɛ nhoma a ɛyɛ anigye.
One more job.	Adwuma foforo biako.
But for him, it wasn’t.	Nanso wɔ ne fam no, na ɛnte saa.
Give him anything, and he can play.	Ma no biribiara, na obetumi abɔ.
My wife did everything.	Me yere na ɔyɛɛ biribiara.
In her room on the bed.	Wɔ ne dan mu wɔ mpa no so.
Here was the next test.	Ná sɔhwɛ a edi hɔ no wɔ ha.
These people don’t.	Saa nkurɔfo yi nyɛ saa.
The man made a strange scene.	Ɔbarima no yɛɛ tebea bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
At least at work.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ adwumam.
There is not much in the room.	Nneɛma pii nni dan no mu.
Believe me,	Gye me di, .
Never assume anything.	Mfa biribiara nsusuw ho da.
Most people don’t.	Nnipa dodow no ara nyɛ saa.
You can do no wrong.	Worentumi nyɛ bɔne biara.
The story went on.	Asɛm no kɔɔ so.
She seemed beautiful.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He really wasn’t there that day.	Na onni hɔ ampa saa da no.
That doesn’t seem to matter.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno nyɛ hwee.
They are a real live person.	Wɔyɛ obi a nkwa wom ankasa.
And I never wanted you.	Na mempɛ wo da.
I'm so bad.	Me bɔne paa.
Resources were resources.	Ná nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma yɛ nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma.
And what is the plan after that? 	Na nhyehyɛe bɛn na ɛwɔ hɔ wɔ ɛno akyi?
You can look out the window.	Wubetumi ahwɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
And so will most investors.	Na saa ara na wɔn a wɔde wɔn sika hyɛ mu no mu dodow no ara bɛyɛ.
I hope he does that.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
The focus is on that alone.	Adwene no wɔ saa asɛm no nkutoo ho.
It’s not in his mind.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ n’adwene mu.
Not for such a job.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛte saa nti.
That means he is not here.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ onni ha.
Just not right now.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren ara kɛkɛ.
I hope you do that.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
They never liked it.	Ná wɔn ani nnye ho da.
That was really a lot of fun.	Na ɛno yɛ anigye kɛse ankasa.
It still bothers me.	Ɔhaw me da so ara.
I believe that it is.	Migye di sɛ ɛte saa.
And it did seem that way.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa ampa.
But it was something that had to be done.	Nanso na ɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I think it’s important.	Misusuw sɛ ɛho hia.
It’s dangerous.	Ɛyɛ asiane.
This is the path one must ultimately take.	Eyi ne ɔkwan a awiei koraa no ɛsɛ sɛ obi fa so.
They don’t need to do much.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ pii.
Like that last one.	Te sɛ saa nea etwa to no.
That much is for sure.	Saa dodow no ara yɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
Things seemed to work out in the end.	Ɛte sɛ nea nneɛma kɔɔ yiye awiei koraa.
I knew it was him.	Ná minim sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno.
It was in its final stages.	Ná ɛwɔ ne fã a etwa to no mu.
I could be anyone.	Ná metumi ayɛ obiara.
Give the money back.	Fa sika no san ma.
That will be right then.	Ɛno bɛyɛ saa bere no ara.
The person who touches it.	Onipa a ɔde ne nsa ka no, ɔde ne ho too so.
And that was hard enough.	Na na ɛno yɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ.
And you have to do that.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
Not even on him.	Ɛnyɛ ne so mpo.
Never so much water.	Nsu pii saa da.
And the reason could just be that he was in danger.	Na nea enti a ɛte saa no betumi ayɛ sɛ na ɔwɔ asiane mu ara kwa.
My turn had come.	Ná me dan aba.
I didn’t care about them.	Ná wɔn ho nhia me.
Where you were headed.	Baabi a na wode w’ani kyerɛ.
Everyone is looking forward to you	Obiara hwɛ wo kwan
Something else happened.	Biribi foforo nso sii.
A few of us.	Yɛn mu kakraa bi.
But the problem remained.	Nanso na ɔhaw no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
The work day is over.	Adwuma da no aba awiei.
The music made us forget our problems.	Nnwom no maa yɛn werɛ fii yɛn haw ahorow no.
It’s part of me.	Ɛyɛ me fã.
You’re a good one.	Woyɛ papa.
Mind never exists in the present.	Adwene nni hɔ da wɔ mprempren tebea mu.
My father no longer understands.	Me papa nte ase bio.
It’s too hard out here.	Ɛyɛ den dodo wɔ ha akyi.
This should hardly come as a surprise.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa.
I am working on it for me.	Mereyɛ ho adwuma ama me.
I can't think of a story to tell.	Mintumi nsusuw asɛm bi a mɛka ho.
I tell people about it.	Meka ho asɛm kyerɛ nkurɔfo.
He knows it, too.	Ɔno nso nim.
I wanted this one.	Ná mepɛ eyi.
Show me!	Kyerɛ me!
This is not about them.	Eyi nyɛ wɔn ho asɛm.
There are a number of reasons for this.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
Let the professionals do the work.	Ma wɔn a wɔyɛ adwuma no nyɛ adwuma.
This is a new thing.	Eyi yɛ ade foforo.
I couldn’t do this.	Na mintumi nyɛ eyi.
Take advantage of the opportunity.	Fa hokwan no di dwuma.
If you find something, post it here.	Sɛ wuhu biribi a, fa hyɛ ha.
I'm in bed.	Mewɔ mpa so.
I didn’t work with him.	Me ne no anyɛ adwuma.
There is almost nothing we can do.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ.
You can do that here.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa wɔ ha.
I see it in him every day.	Mihu no wɔ ne mu da biara da.
You can’t negotiate with bad people.	Worentumi ne nnipa bɔne nsusuw nneɛma ho.
However, I wanted to do more.	Nanso, na mepɛ sɛ meyɛ pii.
Will continue to work on this.	Bɛkɔ so ayɛ eyi ho adwuma.
Even if it wasn’t me, a good team would be good.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ me mpo a, anka kuw pa bɛyɛ papa.
Nothing, as far as he could tell.	Biribiara nni hɔ, sɛnea na obetumi ahu no.
And he had done so.	Na na wayɛ saa.
Your hair is gorgeous!	Wo ti nhwi yɛ fɛ yiye!
The book was an immediate success and remains popular.	Nhoma no dii yiye ntɛm ara na ɛda so ara yɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
Don't mean anything now.	Nkyerɛ hwee mprempren.
You can’t do both.	Worentumi nyɛ abien no nyinaa.
Don't even mention my name.	Nka me din mpo.
This whole book is great.	Saa nhoma yi nyinaa yɛ kɛse.
People often think of it that way.	Nkurɔfo taa susuw ho saa.
I can’t hear them.	Mintumi nte wɔn.
Hours had passed.	Ná nnɔnhwerew pii atwam.
There wasn’t much money left in it.	Sika pii anka wɔ mu.
Who had it.	Hena na na ɔwɔ bi.
A very important point.	Asɛm a ɛho hia kɛse.
If that is the only hope, there is no hope.	Sɛ ɛno nkutoo ne anidaso a, anidaso biara nni hɔ.
And it doesn’t look like that’s going to happen.	Na ɛnte sɛ nea ɛno bɛba.
Yours is my favorite.	Wo de no yɛ nea m’ani gye ho kɛse.
Moreover, there was nothing in front of them.	Bio nso, na biribiara nni wɔn anim.
I want to say it was our time.	Mepɛ sɛ meka sɛ na ɛyɛ yɛn bere.
It’s really beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
I’d appreciate any help.	M’ani begye mmoa biara ho.
A little one at a time.	Kakraa bi biako biara.
There is no doubt about that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho wɔ ɛno ho.
Something inside him clicked.	Biribi a ɛwɔ ne mu no bɔɔ mu.
This is also a good thing.	Eyi nso yɛ nea eye.
These items are extremely rare.	Saa nneɛma yi ho yɛ na kɛse.
We were both amazing.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛ nwonwa.
He joined her, but it was too late.	Ɔde ne ho bɔɔ no, nanso na aka akyi dodo.
If his words are true.	Sɛ ne nsɛm no yɛ nokware a.
They will be about the same length.	Wɔn tenten bɛyɛ pɛ.
Not much, that’s for sure.	Ɛnyɛ pii, ɛno yɛ nokware.
On his words.	Wɔ ne nsɛm no so.
The party is tomorrow.	Apontow no yɛ ɔkyena.
But there was more to it.	Nanso na pii wɔ ho.
I don’t know if they even spent money.	Me nnim sɛ wɔde sika mpo dii dwuma.
He was a good boy.	Ná ɔyɛ abarimaa pa.
That ends now.	Ɛno ba awiei mprempren.
But it’s something.	Nanso ɛyɛ biribi.
We were there.	Ná yɛwɔ hɔ.
He loves me.	Ɔpɛ me.
But it has to be that way.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
But that wasn’t always easy.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ mmerɛw bere nyinaa.
A person who is always a force for good.	Onipa a ɔyɛ tumi pa bere nyinaa.
The head in everyone.	Ti a ɛwɔ obiara mu.
It’s always been the case.	Ɛte saa bere nyinaa.
He was in school at the time.	Saa bere no na ɔwɔ sukuu mu.
Or so it seems.	Anaasɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
Naturally, we do.	Sɛnea ɛte no, yɛyɛ saa.
You want him to hurt you.	Wopɛ sɛ ɔyɛ wo bɔne.
It sounds like you do, thank you.	Ɛte sɛ nea woyɛ no, meda wo ase.
Which is easy.	Nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
It seemed strange.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I was such a girl.	Ná meyɛ abeawa a ɔte saa.
It was never okay to do wrong.	Na ɛnyɛ papa da sɛ yɛbɛyɛ bɔne.
When it is used.	Bere a wɔde di dwuma no.
I don’t want any of that.	Mempɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara.
This should not happen.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi ba.
It was terrible.	Ná ayɛ hu.
There was that, at least.	Na ɛno wɔ hɔ, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
It’s not just an afterthought.	Ɛnyɛ adwene a ɛwɔ akyi ara kwa.
There may still be many more.	Ebia pii da so ara wɔ hɔ.
This will prevent us from continuing.	Eyi bɛma yɛrentumi nkɔ so.
But in the end, the city will want more.	Nanso awiei koraa no, kurow no bɛpɛ pii.
Who was he, anyway? 	Ná ɔyɛ hena?
It would have been a lie.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ atoro.
Make the most of today.	Fa nnɛ di dwuma yiye.
I am working tonight.	Mereyɛ adwuma anadwo yi.
Look at the object carefully.	Hwɛ ade no yiye.
Head to the music and do it today.	Fa w’ani kyerɛ nnwom no na yɛ no nnɛ.
A car collides with a bus.	Kar bi ne bɔs bi abɔ.
Thank you so much for the information.	Meda wo ase pii wɔ nsɛm no ho.
It has a lot of hair on it.	Ɛwɔ nhwi pii wɔ so.
That’s my language.	Ɛno ne me kasa.
You used my name.	Wode me din dii dwuma.
All in all, it doesn’t matter.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɛnyɛ hwee.
Many animals fight each other for life.	Mmoa pii bɔ wɔn ho wɔn ho ma nkwa.
Don’t get excited about them.	Mma w’ani nnye wɔn ho.
I don’t want to know age.	Mempɛ sɛ mihu mfe a obi adi.
I'm going to put myself down.	Mede me ho to fam.
Pictures from the same year.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛwɔ saa afe no ara mu.
It’s really true.	Ɛyɛ nokware ankasa.
Maybe that doesn’t really exist.	Ebia ɛno nni hɔ ankasa.
Both felt it but neither spoke.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa tee nka nanso wɔn mu biara ankasa.
Which shouldn’t surprise me.	Nea ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ me nwonwa.
This is not about me.	Eyi nyɛ me ho asɛm.
It was an old car.	Ná ɛyɛ kar dedaw bi.
What is the name of the school?	Sukuu no din de dɛn?
More details soon.	Nsɛm pii nnansa yi ara.
He gives an idea of ​​the complexity of the task.	Ɔde adwene bi ma wɔ sɛnea adwuma no yɛ den no ho.
The game was over.	Ná agoru no aba awiei.
This means that	Eyi kyerɛ sɛ .
I don’t have to do that.	Ɛho nhia sɛ meyɛ saa.
We can’t play games.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ agoru.
The stronger one.	Nea ɔyɛ den no.
Give yourself a whole afternoon.	Ma wo ho awia mũ nyinaa.
Which isn’t that bad.	Nea ɛnyɛ bɔne saa.
He is in my way.	Ɔwɔ me kwan so.
But this is too dramatic.	Nanso eyi yɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa dodo.
But in time, the matter will become easier.	Nanso bere kɔ so no, asɛm no bɛyɛ mmerɛw.
In a way, it’s perfect.	Ɔkwan bi so no, ɛyɛ pɛ.
Currently it is not.	Mprempren ɛnyɛ saa.
He tells the story.	Ɔka asɛm no.
But it’s not me.	Nanso ɛnyɛ me.
It’s not that big of a big project so much.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma kɛse a ɛyɛ kɛse saa kɛse.
I like that a lot.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho kɛse.
This is a very common problem.	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw a abu so yiye.
However, he may have had a point.	Nanso, ebia na ɔwɔ asɛm bi.
Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Ebia ɛnyɛ hwee.
He thought that was quite possible.	Ná osusuw sɛ ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye koraa.
I can’t have your eyes tonight.	Mintumi nnya w’ani anadwo yi.
himself aside from.	ankasa to nkyɛn a.
Their language is the same.	Wɔn kasa a wɔka no yɛ ade koro.
I can’t do that.	Me ntumi nyɛ saa.
He knew me well, too.	Ná ɔno nso nim me yiye.
You do it every day.	Woyɛ no da biara da.
Or you were, anyway.	Anaasɛ na woyɛ saa, ɔkwan biara so.
He didn’t know.	Ná onnim.
And if you know us, you know that.	Na sɛ wunim yɛn a, wunim saa.
That was what he wanted.	Ɛno ne nea na ɔpɛ.
He just wants the best for me.	Ɔpɛ nea eye sen biara ma me ara kwa.
His head was bald.	Ná ne ti ayɛ ti nhwi.
I told myself I didn’t really care about you.	Meka kyerɛɛ me ho sɛ wo ho nhia me ankasa.
That was a fun thing to do in the movie.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wɔ sini no mu.
It’s so painful for me.	Ɛyɛ me yaw paa.
But recently people have come.	Nanso nnansa yi nnipa aba.
I wasn’t busy.	Ná minni adagyew.
Everyone does that.	Onipa biara yɛ saa.
I wanted everyone to like me.	Ná mepɛ sɛ obiara ani gye me ho.
It’s not about happiness.	Ɛnyɛ anigye ho asɛm.
I felt very strong.	Metee nka sɛ me ho yɛ den yiye.
They should be interested.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn ani gye ho.
But he is also a player.	Nanso ɔno nso yɛ obi a odi agoru.
Not the new one.	Ɛnyɛ foforo no.
Go to work.	Kɔ adwuma.
This was evident on a daily basis.	Ná eyi da adi wɔ da biara da tebea mu.
Real.	Ankasa.
Do you believe this is the right way?	So wugye di sɛ eyi ne ɔkwan pa?
Maybe people are really happy for you.	Ebia nkurɔfo ani gye ankasa ma wo.
You will be added at the last moment.	Wɔde wo bɛka ho wɔ bere a etwa to no mu.
My mind began to grow.	M’adwene fii ase yɛɛ kɛse.
I wasn’t doing well in school.	Ná menyɛ papa wɔ sukuu mu.
Whether it is true is another matter.	Sɛ́ ɛyɛ nokware no yɛ asɛm foforo.
So they are all equal.	Enti wɔn nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
It was really a kindergarten at the time.	Ná ɛyɛ mmofra sukuu ankasa saa bere no.
At least it was warm.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛyɛ hyew.
In this paper we will do the same.	Wɔ krataa yi mu no yɛbɛyɛ saa ara.
Everyone in town knows us.	Obiara a ɔwɔ kurow no mu nim yɛn.
We all had a really great time.	Yɛn nyinaa nyaa anigye kɛse ankasa.
This was going to be a fun day.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ anigye da.
Remove names	Yi din ahorow fi hɔ
That is just an opinion.	Ɛno yɛ adwene a obi wɔ ara kwa.
It has to be that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
To me, it seemed very interesting.	Wɔ me fam no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
Hunt.	Kɔ ha.
In this case, the concept is very simple.	Wɔ saa asɛm yi mu no, adwene no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
School could also greatly use more ideas.	Sukuu nso betumi de adwene pii adi dwuma kɛse.
Something that certainly didn’t surprise us.	Biribi a akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ anyɛ yɛn nwonwa.
Below are a few of them.	Wɔn mu kakraa bi na ɛwɔ ase ha.
It’s been a very, very long time.	Akyɛ paa, paa.
I think that makes a lot of people stronger.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ma nnipa pii mu yɛ den.
His speech was strong and interesting.	Ná ne kasa no yɛ den na na ɛyɛ anigye.
There was nothing he could do to save her.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ de agye no nkwa.
It’s what free people do.	Ɛyɛ nea nnipa a wɔde wɔn ho yɛ.
It just seemed like he wanted more practice and time.	Ɛte sɛ nea na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu ne bere pii ara kwa.
Both at work and at home.	Wɔ adwumam ne fie nyinaa.
I am a very weak person.	Meyɛ obi a meyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Maybe that’s why it’s so hard.	Ebia ɛno nti na ɛyɛ den saa no.
Are you just them.	So woyɛ wɔn ara kwa.
I love this movie so much.	M’ani gye sini yi ho yiye.
At least the present includes them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, mprempren no ka wɔn ho.
Just your money, and that’s it.	Wo sika kɛkɛ, na ɛno ara ne no.
He agreed with them.	Ɔne wɔn yɛɛ adwene.
He is absolutely perfect.	Ɔyɛ pɛ koraa.
Imagine if he didn’t have me.	Susuw ho hwɛ sɛ na onni me a.
He understands, even understands.	Ɔte ase, ɔte ase mpo.
People already know this.	Nkurɔfo nim eyi dedaw.
This meeting is really important.	Saa nhyiam yi ho hia ankasa.
But someone still needs to give this team a win.	Nanso ɛda so ara hia sɛ obi ma saa kuw yi di nkonim.
I can't seem to get this to work.	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi mma eyi nyɛ adwuma.
The other two did well.	Nnipa baanu a aka no yɛɛ yiye.
That time has long passed.	Saa bere no atwam akyɛ.
More opportunities will come your way.	Hokwan pii bɛba wo kwan so.
You have to do everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribiara.
He was an extreme man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔyɛ ade tra so.
I don't have room for him or anything else anymore.	Minni baabi bio mma no anaa biribi foforo biara.
And this is like me.	Na eyi te sɛ me.
He had brought her here.	Ná ɔde no aba ha.
That, however, is the easy part.	Nanso, ɛno ne ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I know how to do it.	Minim sɛnea wɔyɛ.
Make sure that.	Hwɛ hu sɛ...
I can’t practice with that man.	Me ne saa ɔbarima no ntumi nyɛ adesua.
Play three games.	Di agoru abiɛsa.
That is his plan.	Ɛno ne ne nhyehyɛe.
He has told me so much.	Ɔde nsɛm pii aka akyerɛ me.
And that was the case with me.	Na saa na na ɛte wɔ me fam.
However, maybe he just doesn’t know.	Nanso, ebia onnim ara kwa.
The food drive continues to this day.	Aduan a wɔde ma no kɔ so de besi nnɛ.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ.
Consider this problem carefully.	Susuw ɔhaw yi ho yiye.
Not that it matters much.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛho hia kɛse.
I couldn’t even feel it, and I couldn’t control it.	Na mintumi nte nka mpo, na na mintumi nni so nso.
I don’t know how we do it.	Minnim sɛnea yɛyɛ.
There are probably two reasons for this.	Ebia nneɛma abien nti na ɛte saa.
It was an absolutely stunning picture so far.	Na ɛyɛ mfonini a ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa de besi saa bere yi.
That’s what they’ve signed up for.	Ɛno na wɔde wɔn nsa ahyɛ ase.
His eyes were filled with thought.	Ná adwene ahyɛ n’ani so ma.
You have to work with me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne me yɛ adwuma.
Return to the worksheet.	San kɔ adwuma krataa no so.
Good for them.	Eye ma wɔn.
It’s so nice.	Ɛte saa.
I have a lot of money.	Mewɔ sika pii.
There are a lot of interesting people.	Nnipa a wɔn ani gye ho pii wɔ hɔ.
He enjoyed the game.	N’ani gyee agoru no ho.
No one knew where he was.	Na obiara nnim baabi a ɔwɔ.
No one may be able to help you.	Ebia obiara ntumi mmoa wo.
I cannot see this problem.	Mintumi nhu ɔhaw yi.
There was nothing left for him.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a aka ama no.
That was a number of years ago.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfe dodow bi a atwam ni.
Much of the information in this book is now outdated.	Mprempren nsɛm a ɛwɔ nhoma yi mu no mu dodow no ara ne bere atwam.
We can do both.	Yebetumi ayɛ abien no nyinaa.
That’s never good enough.	Ɛno nyɛ papa da.
This has been a lot of fun.	Eyi ayɛ anigye kɛse.
And it seemed to be heading their way again.	Na na ɛte sɛ nea ɛrekɔ wɔn kwan so bio.
It seems difficult for him.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den ma no.
It’s a big part of the big picture.	Ɛyɛ mfonini kɛse no fã kɛse.
I can take care of myself.	Metumi ahwɛ me ho.
Which is a beautiful idea.	Nea ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Just, what are you doing to me.	Kɛkɛ, dɛn na woreyɛ me.
Why do people come here every year?	Dɛn nti na nkurɔfo ba ha afe biara?
It is decreasing every year.	Ɛrekɔ fam afe biara.
It just seems similar.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte sɛ nea ɛte ara kwa.
Not sooner or later.	Ɛnyɛ ntɛm anaa akyiri yi.
So, that’s why you should give this subject some thought.	Enti, ɛno nti na ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw saa asɛm yi ho kakra no.
I am a tactile person.	Meyɛ obi a metumi de ne nsa ka ade.
Even a year or two ago, it was easy.	Afe biako anaa abien a atwam ni mpo no, na ɛnyɛ den.
Good fun, but again no money involved.	Anigye pa, nanso bio sika biara nka ho.
My head is clear again.	Me ti mu da hɔ bio.
It feels and looks a little better.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte na ɛyɛ fɛ kakra.
It’s all very strange.	Ne nyinaa yɛ nwonwa yiye.
Mass delivery programs are important.	Nhyehyɛe ahorow a wɔde ma nnipa pii no ho hia.
The man went to his house.	Ɔbarima no kɔɔ ne fie.
He put all the food away.	Ɔde aduan no nyinaa too hɔ.
He doesn’t do much now.	Ɔnyɛ pii mprempren.
Everything was going well.	Na biribiara rekɔ yiye.
But being a good person can be hard work.	Nanso onipa pa a obi bɛyɛ no betumi ayɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den.
You have no idea how much that means to me.	Wunnim sɛnea ɛno kyerɛ kɛse ma me.
You just remembered.	Wokae kɛkɛ.
This present moment is like that.	Saa bere yi a ɛwɔ hɔ mprempren yi te sɛ nea ɛte no.
That may be true.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ nokware.
He was completely surprised.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​nwonwa koraa.
Nothing for me here.	Biribiara nni hɔ mma me wɔ ha.
The painting was touched up one last time.	Wɔde wɔn nsa kaa mfonini no ho nea etwa to.
The shoes felt amazing.	Ná mpaboa no te nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Sure, people will always game the system.	Ampa, nkurɔfo bɛbɔ nhyehyɛe no agoru bere nyinaa.
No one but me seemed to notice his absence for so long.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara anhu sɛ onni hɔ bere tenten no, gye me nkutoo.
Everyone should play this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara bɔ eyi.
He has information that no normal person can have.	Ɔwɔ nsɛm a obi a ɔte ase biara ntumi nnya bi.
More information is provided in and.	Wɔde nsɛm pii ama wɔ ne.
And tell everyone what to do and how to do it.	Na ka nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ne sɛnea ɔbɛyɛ no kyerɛ obiara.
But that’s not the point now.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no mprempren.
I didn’t really know what to do.	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ ankasa.
Dangerous, no problem.	Asiane, ɔhaw biara nni ho.
His head is throbbing violently.	Ne ti rebɔ denneennen.
He was great at it.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse wɔ mu.
That’s how he felt.	Saa ara na na ɔte no.
He’s an intelligent, strong-minded kid.	Ɔyɛ abofra a ɔwɔ nyansa, a n’adwene yɛ den.
Look like the good guy.	Hwɛ sɛ ɔbarima pa no.
It’s my opinion.	Ɛyɛ m’adwene.
We just love it so much.	Yɛn ani gye ho yiye ara kwa.
What are you looking forward to?.	Dɛn na w’ani wɔ so?.
I glanced from one to the other.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ biako so kɔɔ foforo so.
I thought hard about the latter.	Misusuw nea etwa to no ho denneennen.
You’re interested in him.	W’ani gye ne ho.
I never knew that.	Ná minnim saa da.
It’s the first one.	Ɛyɛ nea edi kan.
I thought about that.	Misusuw saa asɛm no ho.
Could that be true?.	So ɛno betumi ayɛ nokware?.
That’s just as good, really.	Saa ara na eye, ampa.
He wants to live alone.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno nkutoo tra ase.
And anything else you want to show.	Na biribi foforo biara a wopɛ sɛ wode kyerɛ.
That is certainly the case here.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛte saa wɔ ha.
For you, this is a familiar thing.	Wɔ wo fam no, eyi yɛ ade a wunim yiye.
This pretty much works fine.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma yiye.
Well done, group.	Woayɛ no yiye, kuw.
Tell us about that.	Ka saa asɛm no kyerɛ yɛn.
They are both good people.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ nnipa pa.
It doesn’t have to be true or false.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware anaa atoro.
It’s a good thing.	Ɛyɛ ade pa.
Most of it is true.	Ne fã kɛse no ara yɛ nokware.
That’s his name.	Ɛno ne ne din.
It’s all still here.	Ne nyinaa da so ara wɔ ha.
I could make people happy.	Ná metumi ama nkurɔfo ani agye.
I believe there is a better way.	Migye di sɛ ɔkwan a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ.
No one can tell him about this.	Obiara nni hɔ a obetumi aka eyi ho asɛm akyerɛ no.
If it’s hard you can do something else.	Sɛ ɛyɛ den a wubetumi ayɛ biribi foforo.
That man knows how to work.	Saa ɔbarima no nim sɛnea wɔyɛ adwuma.
Not in this house he doesn’t.	Ɛnyɛ ofie yi mu na ɔnyɛ saa.
Besides, it’s night.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɛyɛ anadwo.
It’s so crazy.	Ɛyɛ kraman paa.
I just couldn’t take it anymore.	Na mintumi nnye bio kɛkɛ.
So would you if you had a name like his.	Saa ara na anka wobɛyɛ sɛ wowɔ din te sɛ ne de no a.
I always had something to say to him.	Ná mewɔ biribi a mɛka akyerɛ no bere nyinaa.
They are very expensive though.	Wɔn bo yɛ den yiye nanso.
Everyone else had been gone for a few days.	Ná obiara a aka no akɔ hɔ nna kakraa bi.
It’s not you.	Ɛnyɛ wo.
I love the people who work there.	M’ani gye nnipa a wɔyɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ no ho.
The population of this city grew rapidly.	Nnipa dodow kɔɔ anim ntɛmntɛm wɔ kurow yi mu.
We are that one.	Yɛn na yɛyɛ saa biako no.
It certainly looks very interesting.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
Or something like that.	Anaasɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
The whole time, the back of my mind was at work.	Bere no nyinaa, na m’adwene akyi no reyɛ adwuma.
But that was that moment.	Nanso ɛno ne saa bere no.
I tell you the girl is no good.	Meka kyerɛ wo sɛ abeawa no nyɛ papa biara.
He gives it to her.	Ɔno ma no.
We put important things aside one day.	Yɛde nneɛma a ɛho hia to nkyɛn da bi.
That’s what he has.	Ɛno ne nea ɔwɔ.
People’s eyes are on you.	Nkurɔfo ani so hwɛ wo.
I was totally in tune with them.	Ná me ne wɔn yɛ biako koraa.
I love this house.	M’ani gye ofie yi ho.
He thought we were friends.	Ná osusuw sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo.
I don't care what you think.	Nea wususuw ho no mfa me ho.
Nor was it a matter of speculation.	Na ɛnyɛ asɛm a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho nso.
I have invested my time in each of them.	Mede me bere ahyɛ wɔn mu biara mu.
It has been terrible to this day.	Ayɛ hu de besi nnɛ.
It’s a beautiful language.	Ɛyɛ kasa a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Remove it from the mu.	Yi fi mu.
What does this mean?	Dɛn ne nea eyi kyerɛ?
Clothing was another matter.	Ná atade yɛ asɛm foforo.
The less dangerous ones.	Wɔn a asiane nnim no.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani gye ho saa.
There was no way right there.	Ná ɔkwan biara nni hɔ wɔ hɔ ara.
The more you do this, the better off you will be.	Dodow a woyɛ eyi no, dodow no ara na wobɛyɛ yiye.
The city after a busy day.	Kurow no wɔ da a adagyew nnim akyi.
The police, man.	Polisifo no, ɔbarima.
Or to be driven.	Anaasɛ sɛ wɔde kar bɛka wo.
He wrapped his arms around me.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ me mu.
That is not a good way.	Ɛno nyɛ ɔkwan pa.
You know what they have to do.	Wunim nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
You know, things like shoes.	Wunim, nneɛma te sɛ mpaboa.
You want, you want, you want!.	Wopɛ, wopɛ, wopɛ!.
But it’s too late.	Nanso aka akyi.
The data are from three experiments.	Nsɛm a wɔde ama no fi sɔhwɛ ahorow abiɛsa mu.
Can you tell me when the last bus leaves?	So wubetumi aka bere a bɔs a etwa to no fi hɔ no akyerɛ me?
But the party is over now.	Nanso apontow no aba awiei mprempren.
This is a new one.	Eyi yɛ foforo.
He knew as if it had happened before his eyes.	Ná onim te sɛ nea asi wɔ n’ani so.
But there is no joy.	Nanso anigye biara nni hɔ.
This room is warm.	Saa dan yi mu yɛ hyew.
They work and they work well.	Wɔyɛ adwuma na wɔyɛ adwuma yiye.
I say really bad people.	Meka nnipa bɔne ankasa.
Give him plenty of time.	Ma no bere pii.
It’s as simple as that itself.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ ɛno ankasa.
He is in all of us.	Ɔwɔ yɛn nyinaa mu.
He was often away from home at night.	Mpɛn pii no, na onni fie anadwo.
And that causes a lot of problems.	Na ɛno de ɔhaw pii ba.
We are all in some way in the human business.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ ɔkwan bi so no wɔ nnipa adwuma no mu.
Include only the most important information.	Fa nsɛm a ɛho hia sen biara nkutoo ka ho.
That doesn’t mean anything.	Ɛno nkyerɛ biribiara.
I don't have any.	Minni bi.
This is a story that children will enjoy.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a mmofra ani begye ho.
And I'm not the same.	Na me nso me.
Except for you alone.	Gye sɛ wo nkutoo.
That would be painful.	Ɛno bɛyɛ yaw.
But it wasn’t the first time.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ bere a edi kan.
There are many different types of music.	Nnwom ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
The house was empty.	Ná ofie no mu da hɔ kwa.
And that’s what you have to do.	Na ɛno ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Inside and out, inside and out.	Wɔ mu ne akyi, mu ne akyi.
He has many names.	Ɔwɔ din ahorow pii.
My mother had one.	Ná me maame wɔ bi.
He has no close friends to speak of.	Onni nnamfo paa a ɔbɛka ne ho asɛm.
Sounds like a plan to me.	Ɛte sɛ nhyehyɛe bi ma me.
I looked at him with interest.	Mede anigye hwɛɛ no ​​denneennen.
Not everyone has those things either.	Ɛnyɛ obiara nso na ɔwɔ saa nneɛma no.
I’m glad that what happened, happened.	M’ani agye sɛ nea esii no, sii.
It’s a fascinating story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
It’s not fun.	Ɛnyɛ anigye.
The moon was half full.	Ná ɔsram no fã ayɛ ma.
When you are a child.	Bere a woyɛ abofra no.
Maybe it’s just both.	Ebia ɛyɛ abien no nyinaa ara kwa.
That’s how something else comes along.	Saa na biribi foforo ba.
I'm the one who likes it.	Me na m'ani gye ho.
I have to do this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi.
I nodded again.	Mede me ti too fam bio.
Besides, no one knows we’re here.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, obiara nnim sɛ yɛwɔ ha.
I think so.	Misusuw saa.
Almost every day.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ da biara.
The girl is a bad girl.	Abeawa no yɛ abeawa bɔne.
And everything else comes from that.	Na biribiara a aka no fi ɛno mu.
It wasn’t a thing.	Ná ɛnyɛ hwee.
This was to be a pleasant evening.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ anwummere a ɛyɛ anigye.
That seems pretty amazing.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ nwonwa yiye.
It wasn’t easy at all.	Ná ɛnyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
Someone else had brought it.	Ná obi foforo na ɔde aba.
What you need to think about.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
But this will be good.	Nanso eyi bɛyɛ papa.
It wasn’t an accident.	Na ɛnyɛ akwanhyia bi.
That will take some time.	Ɛno begye bere kakra.
But he had no time to question his fears.	Nanso na onni bere a ɔde begye ne suro no ho akyinnye.
Still.	Da so.
Fill the container with water.	Fa nsu hyɛ ade no mu ma.
The girl had trouble sleeping that night.	Ná abeawa no nna haw saa anadwo no.
I'm really for him.	Meyɛ ma no ankasa.
Neither of them knew what to say.	Ná wɔn mu biara nnim nea ɔbɛka.
So he says.	Enti ɔka.
Do what you think is most important first.	Di kan yɛ nneɛma a wususuw sɛ ɛho hia sen biara no.
You should do the same.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ saa.
He felt he could say anything.	Ná ɔte nka sɛ obetumi aka biribiara.
He does, and there is no doubt about it.	Ɔyɛ saa, na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
I could be wrong now.	Metumi adi mfomso mprempren.
You'll tell me.	Wobɛka akyerɛ me.
It doesn’t sit on him right now.	Ɛnte ne so seesei ara.
The presence of the child.	Ba a ɛwɔ hɔ.
So he took the girl to his house.	Enti ɔde abeawa no kɔɔ ne fie.
The ingredients of the water.	Nneɛma a wɔde yɛ nsu no.
I wish he could help me.	Me yam a anka obetumi aboa me.
It’s one of a kind.	Ɛyɛ biako.
Be careful what people say, but watch what they do.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ nea nnipa ka ho, nanso hwɛ nea wɔyɛ.
He signed it off.	Ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ ase.
You brought me there.	Wo na wode me baa hɔ.
But he always knew.	Nanso na onim bere nyinaa.
The story starts to come out.	Asɛm no fi ase fi adi.
It’s outside in my car.	Ɛwɔ abɔnten wɔ me kar mu.
So the matter was dropped.	Enti wɔde asɛm no too hɔ.
Maybe we’ll be interested.	Ebia yɛn ani begye ho.
Maybe we can get our own table.	Ebia yebetumi anya yɛn ankasa pon.
I want to have sex with her.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no da.
At your doorstep.	Wɔ wo pon ano.
I don’t know how to tell.	Minnim sɛnea mɛka akyerɛ.
And do a good job in that regard.	Na yɛ adwuma yiye wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
If he did that.	Sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa a.
I have a lot of it.	Mewɔ pii.
I knew them.	Ná minim wɔn.
Imagine what it must have been like down there.	Susuw sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛte wɔ fam hɔ no ho hwɛ.
My head started to hurt.	Me ti fii ase yɛɛ me yaw.
I could never do anything right.	Na mintumi nyɛ biribiara yiye da.
The success of this project is questionable.	Sɛnea adwuma yi ayɛ yiye no yɛ nea asɛm wɔ ho.
This is important later.	Eyi ho hia akyiri yi.
However, my mother disagrees.	Nanso, me maame ne no nyɛ adwene.
So he looked busy.	Enti na ɔte sɛ nea onni adagyew.
But only if you want to.	Nanso sɛ wopɛ nkutoo a.
I think he’s happy.	Misusuw sɛ n’ani agye.
So, do it another time.	Enti, yɛ no bere foforo.
But me, look how beautiful you are.	Nanso me, hwɛ sɛnea wo ho yɛ fɛ.
It’s a lot to think about.	Ɛyɛ pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
Now something else is happening.	Seesei biribi foforo rekɔ so.
He had done it himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa ayɛ no.
These tests are important.	Saa sɔhwɛ ahorow yi ho hia.
And make him look even more sexy.	Na ma ɔnyɛ sɛ obi a ɔpɛ nna mpo.
He had every right to do so.	Ná ɔwɔ hokwan biara sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
There is nothing remarkable about the game.	Biribiara nni agoru no ho a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There is no one.	Obiara nni hɔ.
My hands hurt.	Me nsa yɛɛ me yaw.
But not many people talk about this idea.	Nanso nnipa pii nka saa adwene yi ho asɛm.
You’re amazing.	Wo ho yɛ nwonwa.
I don’t have a great job.	Minni adwuma kɛse biara.
It’s a whole new system.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe foforo koraa.
I’d appreciate any help.	M’ani begye mmoa biara ho.
They were already halfway across.	Ná wɔde wɔn ho abɔ wɔn ho fã dedaw.
That was three years ago.	Ɛno yɛ mfe abiɛsa a atwam ni.
But the species also matter.	Nanso mmoa ahorow no nso ho hia.
Which is most of them.	Nea ɛyɛ wɔn mu dodow no ara.
He looked at it thoughtfully.	Ɔde adwene hwɛɛ mu.
As you said, things are the same.	Sɛnea wokae no, saa ara na nneɛma te.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
However, this is not the case.	Nanso, eyi nte saa.
He patted a dog.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ɔkraman bi so.
But something seemed wrong.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea biribi anyɛ yiye.
I had his mother.	Ná mewɔ ne maame.
If money is not a problem,	Sɛ sika nyɛ ɔhaw a, .
And certainly not in front of children.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ mmofra anim.
Just be careful with him.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ ne ho ara kwa.
There is some truth to that.	Nokware bi wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
I just have to believe it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye di ara kwa.
There’s just nothing exciting.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ anigye kɛkɛ.
There is still much work to be done.	Adwuma kɛse da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I really wanted a fast car.	Ná mepɛ kar a ɛyɛ ntɛm ankasa.
It will do the same for you.	Ɛbɛyɛ wo saa ara.
The road runs through the city.	Ɔkwan no fa kurow no mu.
And that’s exactly what happened.	Na ɛno ara ne nea esii.
I didn’t think we were that close of friends.	Ná minsusuw sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo paa saa.
Everything but his son.	Biribiara gye ne ba no nkutoo.
It was very difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den yiye.
You could see that.	Ná wubetumi ahu saa.
I'm sorry for you.	Mepa wo kyɛw.
It was incredibly cold in our room.	Ná awɔw wom a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ yɛn dan mu.
I did a lot of work.	Meyɛɛ adwuma pii.
But that’s the whole point.	Nanso ɛno ne asɛm no nyinaa.
And he was great.	Na na ɔyɛ kɛse.
The horror stories continue to grow.	Nsɛm a ɛyɛ hu no kɔ so yɛ kɛse.
We can see these things.	Yebetumi ahu saa nneɛma yi.
He used me in a difficult way.	Ɔde me dii dwuma wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ den so.
It just didn’t matter.	Ná ɛnyɛ hwee kɛkɛ.
That’s why it’s all bad.	Ɛno nti na ne nyinaa yɛ bɔne no.
That’s the issue here.	Ɛno ne asɛm a ɛwɔ ha.
I don’t want to talk about this.	Mempɛ sɛ meka eyi ho asɛm.
This doesn’t feel like home.	Eyi nte nka sɛ ɛyɛ ofie.
Wasn’t that good.	So na ɛnyɛ papa.
Think about it from his perspective for a moment.	Susuw ho fi n’adwene mu kakra.
It works well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
I didn’t know what to think.	Ná minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
I did my best.	Meyɛɛ nea metumi biara.
They very well should.	Wɔn yiye paa ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
At least he wasn’t alone.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo.
This book is really interesting.	Nhoma yi yɛ anigye ankasa.
And we can work with people.	Na yebetumi ne nkurɔfo ayɛ adwuma.
Unlike a job.	Nea ɛnte sɛ adwuma bi.
He seemed to be, but maybe not.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔte saa, nanso ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
I used this method for him.	Mede saa kwan yi dii dwuma maa no.
John came to the meeting later.	John baa nhyiam no ase akyiri yi.
That’s not a bad thing at all.	Ɛno nyɛ ade bɔne koraa.
This can’t be the end.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ awiei no.
Now we do that.	Seesei yɛyɛ saa.
It was a beautiful day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I know you do that.	Minim sɛ woyɛ saa.
I don’t think anyone should.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ obiara yɛ saa.
His cheap shot failed.	Ne tuo a ne bo nyɛ den no antumi anyɛ yiye.
It’s been a long time.	Ɛyɛ bere tenten ni.
At least that is true.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno yɛ nokware.
And be honest with yourself about how things are really going.	Na di wo ho nokware wɔ sɛnea nneɛma rekɔ so ankasa ho.
My hands were numb.	Ná me nsa ayɛ mmerɛw.
We can do the same here.	Yebetumi ayɛ saa wɔ ha nso.
It just wasn’t good for them.	Na ɛnyɛ papa mma wɔn kɛkɛ.
But it’s not that easy.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
His head was bare.	Ná ne ti so da hɔ.
You know the pictures.	Wunim mfonini ahorow no.
Before the end of the year.	Ansa na afe no bɛba awiei.
And in a way, he looked like a child.	Na ɔkwan bi so no, na ɔte sɛ abofra.
People have talked about it.	Nkurɔfo aka ho asɛm.
I still feel that way.	Meda so ara te nka saa.
This happens to everyone.	Eyi to obiara.
I have been using it since my kids were little.	Mede adi dwuma fi bere a na me mma yɛ mmofra no.
I thought he did an awesome job.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔyɛɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ hu.
You shouldn’t use it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wode di dwuma.
You could see why.	Ná wubetumi ahu nea enti a ɛte saa.
I wonder how they got the point.	Misusuw sɛnea wɔn nsa kaa asɛm no ho.
Maybe he does know.	Ebia onim ampa.
And that’s important.	Na ɛno ho hia.
The music is great.	Nnwom no yɛ kɛse.
Old painted window frames.	Mfɛnsere mu mfonini a wɔde ayɛ mfonini dedaw.
Many of them come from the first impression.	Wɔn mu pii fi adwene a edi kan no mu.
That was my fault.	Ná ɛno ne me bɔne.
Thank you for everything you have done.	Meda wo ase wɔ biribiara a woayɛ no ho.
The danger is growing.	Asiane no reyɛ kɛse.
You two can play again.	Mo baanu betumi adi agoru bio.
And you do, too.	Na wo nso woyɛ saa.
This had to be a mistake.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ mfomso.
This is why these two statements are so simple.	Eyi nti na nsɛm abien yi yɛ mmerɛw koraa no.
But he knew it all.	Nanso na onim ne nyinaa.
But this story has to come to an end at some point.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ saa asɛm yi ba awiei bere bi.
If anything, it's actually harder.	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, ɛyɛ den sen saa ankasa.
It’s all just me.	Ne nyinaa yɛ me nkutoo.
You need to know this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu eyi.
What would you do in our shoes?.	Dɛn na anka wobɛyɛ wɔ yɛn mpaboa mu?.
Anyone can show here.	Obiara betumi akyerɛ wɔ ha.
Some schools operate only one season.	Sukuu ahorow bi yɛ adwuma bere koro pɛ.
Every time.	Bere biara.
Bigger doesn’t mean harder.	Kɛse nkyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den.
It’s just important that you can do something with them.	Ɛho hia ara kwa sɛ wubetumi ne wɔn ayɛ biribi.
The same thing was true.	Saa ara na na ɛte.
I don’t need to tell you the details.	Ɛho nhia sɛ meka nsɛm no mu nsɛm kyerɛ wo.
What has happened in the past is the past.	Nea asi wɔ bere a atwam no mu ne bere a atwam no.
You would have known better.	Anka wunim yiye.
The experiment would take place on relatively simple terms.	Ná sɔhwɛ no bɛkɔ so wɔ nsɛm a ɛnyɛ den koraa so.
It’s trendy right now.	Ɛyɛ nea aba so foforo mprempren.
Most people say three, but that’s not true.	Nnipa dodow no ara ka abiɛsa, nanso ɛnyɛ nokware.
I didn’t know much about them.	Ná minnim wɔn ho nsɛm pii.
Just say what you want to say.	Ka kɛkɛ sɛ wopɛ sɛ woka.
It felt authentic and solid.	Ná ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware na ɛyɛ den.
One half of someone.	Obi fã biako.
So that’s what you tell him.	Enti ɛno ne nea woka kyerɛ no.
Beautiful people, too.	Nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ, nso.
Or at least the same.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa ara.
The reaction should be stronger still.	Ɛsɛ sɛ sɛnea wɔyɛ wɔn ade no mu yɛ den kɛse da so ara.
There was no one left.	Ná obiara nni hɔ bio.
Not on this one.	Ɛnyɛ eyi so.
He leaned his head against the window.	Ɔde ne ti too mfɛnsere no so.
We have the money to do it.	Yɛwɔ sika a yɛde bɛyɛ.
That is absolutely true.	Ɛno yɛ nokware ankasa.
He has to take me to bed.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde me kɔ mpa so.
He had no power here.	Ná onni tumi biara wɔ ha.
There is still a chance for you.	Hokwan da so ara wɔ hɔ ma wo.
Pick up.	Kɔ fa.
I know a little bit.	Minim kakraa bi.
But no one could tell me what it was.	Nanso na obiara antumi ankyerɛ me nea ɛyɛ.
This city is very beautiful.	Kurow yi yɛ fɛ yiye.
Water is essential for all life.	Nsu ho hia ma nkwa nyinaa.
I don't know how to work this out.	Minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ eyi ho adwuma.
This dog is a monster.	Saa ɔkraman yi yɛ aboa kɛse bi.
They are really awesome.	Wɔyɛ hu ankasa.
This is the end of the dry season.	Eyi ne ɔpɛ bere no awiei.
This is when the game begins.	Eyi ne bere a agoru no fi ase.
Why is this the case?	Dɛn nti na eyi te saa?
Only the one to give him a hand.	Nea ɔde ne nsa bɛma no nkutoo.
The police determined this was not an accident.	Polisifo no sii gyinae sɛ eyi nyɛ akwanhyia.
It was a really amazing thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
That year, summer was endless.	Saa afe no, na awɔw bere nni ano.
However, that was not the most important thing.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ ɛno ne ade a ɛho hia sen biara.
That hope is long gone.	Saa anidaso no afi hɔ bere tenten ni.
If a man.	Sɛ ɔbarima bi.
And you will be weak.	Na wobɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Few of us are interested in being exotic.	Yɛn mu kakraa bi na yɛn ani gye ho sɛ yɛbɛyɛ obi a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
No one saw it as life.	Obiara anhu sɛ ɛyɛ nkwa.
They get used to it immediately.	Wɔyɛ wɔn su ntɛm ara.
I can't seem to get it to work very well.	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi mma ɛnyɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
That would be two.	Ɛno bɛyɛ abien.
Perhaps he did not like what he was told.	Ebia na n’ani nnye nea wɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​no ho.
It wasn’t a pretty shot.	Na ɛnyɛ tuo a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I think he can again.	Misusuw sɛ obetumi bio.
And so it is with the character.	Na saa ara ne sɛnea ɛte.
I would go to the moon.	Ná mɛkɔ ɔsram no so.
So, that will continue to happen.	Enti, ɛno bɛkɔ so aba.
I didn’t have to do anything that night.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ meyɛ biribiara saa anadwo no.
This is not an easy task.	Eyi nyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
This is actually my favorite hairstyle right now.	Eyi ne ti nhwi a m’ani gye ho kɛse ankasa mprempren.
Whatever is going on.	Nea ɛrekɔ so biara.
I can't really see the error.	Mintumi nhu mfomso no ankasa.
It’s much more complicated than that.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den sen saa koraa.
Everyone was happy with the team’s success.	Obiara ani gyee nkonim a kuw no dii no ho.
I heard about him.	Metee ne ho asɛm.
No food for two days.	Aduan biara nni hɔ nna abien.
But there was one problem.	Nanso na ɔhaw biako wɔ hɔ.
I'm in one right now.	Mewɔ biako mu mprempren ara.
I want you to think about it carefully.	Mepɛ sɛ wususuw ho yiye.
He was interested in this.	Ná n’ani gye eyi ho.
If not enjoying the weirdness of it all, maybe.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa a ɛyɛ nwonwa no mu anigye a, ebia.
This was often true.	Mpɛn pii no, na eyi yɛ nokware.
I get that now.	Me nsa ka saa mprempren.
He is definitely the man with the job.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔno ne onipa a ɔwɔ adwuma no.
There’s a lot going on with it.	Nneɛma pii na ɛrekɔ so wɔ ho.
No wonder they are friends.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ wɔyɛ nnamfo.
You have done quite well.	Woayɛ no yiye koraa.
Keep him busy too.	Ma ɔno nso nkɔ so nyɛ adwuma.
But he could be happy when he wanted to.	Nanso na obetumi anya anigye bere a ɔpɛ no.
They may look just like us.	Ebia wɔn ho te sɛ yɛn ara pɛ.
He never wanted to risk that with anyone else.	Na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔne obi foforo biara de saa asiane no to asiane mu da.
This was going to be harder than he thought.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ den sen sɛnea na osusuw.
Apparently not that much.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ pii saa.
The best music is what we use.	Nnwom a eye sen biara ne nea yɛde di dwuma.
The book was very old.	Ná nhoma no akyɛ paa.
We will do everything as one.	Yɛbɛyɛ biribiara sɛ biako.
Only the first one happened.	Nea edi kan nkutoo na esii.
There are many people in this city.	Nnipa pii wɔ kurow yi mu.
It was a disaster but they were the end.	Na ɛyɛ asiane nanso na wɔyɛ awiei.
One simply cannot see that moment.	Obi ntumi nhu saa bere no ara kwa.
The same thing is just happening today.	Ade koro no ara na ɛrekɔ so nnɛ ara kwa.
It was really ours.	Ná ɛyɛ yɛn de ankasa.
Any variety seemed to be a good thing.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea nneɛma ahorow biara a wɔyɛ no yɛ ade pa.
Other than that, your approach seems fine.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, ɛte sɛ nea wo kwan no yɛ fɛ.
This was not on them.	Ná eyi nni wɔn so.
For a long time.	Bere tenten bi.
However, it is not really true.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa.
In a way.	Ɔkwan bi so.
He could have gone.	Ná obetumi akɔ.
The weekend was amazing.	Ná dapɛn awiei no yɛ nwonwa.
It didn’t seem to matter.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ hwee.
Look at our situation.	Hwɛ sɛnea yɛn tebea te.
I really hear it.	Mete no ampa.
This is a simple task.	Eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛnyɛ den.
I knew what he liked.	Ná minim nea n’ani gye ho.
I never wanted to do that.	Na mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa da.
And not too real at the same time.	Na ɛnyɛ nokware dodo bere koro no ara mu.
But she was very beautiful.	Nanso na ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
But it’s not quite right.	Nanso ɛnyɛ yiye koraa.
This is not the case.	Eyi nyɛ saa.
Maybe he could help them too?	Ebia na ɔno nso betumi aboa wɔn?
Every time, this one time.	Bere biara, bere biako yi ara.
She looked as wonderful as ever.	Ná ne ho yɛ nwonwa te sɛ kan no.
But there is more to consider here.	Nanso pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho wɔ ha.
But, think about it.	Nanso, susuw ho hwɛ.
Not that he ever did.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa da.
I want more of that.	Mepɛ saa nneɛma pii.
Kids these days are definitely busier than we are.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mmofra nnansa yi nni adagyew sen yɛn.
But it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ade bɔne ankasa.
And they do it every day.	Na wɔyɛ no da biara da.
When we were both human.	Bere a na yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛ nnipa no.
Their children will be fine.	Wɔn mma bɛyɛ yiye.
I have a job to do.	Mewɔ adwuma bi.
He has something to offer us.	Ɔwɔ biribi a ɔde bɛma yɛn.
Give the money immediately.	Fa sika no ma ntɛm ara.
We have a job to do.	Yɛwɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
See when two hours later.	Hwɛ bere a nnɔnhwerew abien akyi.
Tell them what you are doing.	Ka nea woreyɛ no kyerɛ wɔn.
But this is important.	Nanso eyi ho hia.
And part of the night.	Na anadwo no fã bi nso.
People often equate the two.	Mpɛn pii no, nkurɔfo de abien no yɛ pɛ.
But there was no time for that.	Nanso na bere biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ saa.
I need to talk to him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa.
Maybe both happened.	Ebia abien no nyinaa sii.
The number meant nothing to me, but it felt impressive.	Ná dodow no nkyerɛ hwee mma me, nanso na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He sits at the table.	Ɔte pon no ho.
The idea is similar.	Adwene no te sɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
He is completely busy.	Ɔwɔ adagyew koraa.
Never use your real name on anything.	Mfa wo din ankasa nni dwuma wɔ biribiara so da.
Just one year ago today.	Afe biako pɛ a atwam ni nnɛ.
Look and see.	Hwɛ na hwɛ.
Many species are rare here.	Mmoa ahorow pii ho yɛ na wɔ ha.
Such uses are becoming increasingly common.	Nneɛma a ɛte saa a wɔde di dwuma no reyɛ nea abu so kɛse.
Not much fun.	Ɛnyɛ anigye pii.
But she is not so beautiful.	Nanso ne ho nyɛ fɛ saa.
I think everyone knows that.	Misusuw sɛ obiara nim saa.
But that’s a good thing.	Nanso ɛno yɛ ade pa.
That’s just the job.	Ɛno ne adwuma no ara kwa.
I think it’s just as it should be.	Misusuw sɛ ɛte saa ara sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no.
I didn’t agree with them.	Ná me ne wɔn nyɛ adwene.
It was a mistake to bring him here like that.	Ná ɛyɛ mfomso sɛ wɔde no bɛba ha saa.
Get your letter.	Gye wo krataa.
The people had to control it themselves.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo no ankasa di so.
We are told that over and over again.	Wɔka saa kyerɛ yɛn mpɛn pii.
We were good friends.	Ná yɛyɛ nnamfo pa.
You never know how things are going to turn out.	Wunnim sɛnea nneɛma bɛkɔ so da.
He knew why he didn't.	Ná onim nea enti a onnim saa.
I find myself doing the same thing.	Mihu sɛ mereyɛ ade koro no ara.
We work at risk.	Yɛyɛ adwuma wɔ asiane mu.
It is an integral part of the real you.	Ɛyɛ wo ankasa no fã a ɛyɛ pɛ.
I’m even jealous.	M’ani bere mpo.
But no one seemed to be able to tell me.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea obiara ntumi nka nkyerɛ me.
Be absolutely careful.	Hwɛ yiye koraa.
So was this one, too.	Saa na na eyi nso te.
The prospects are not good.	Anidaso no nyɛ papa.
I felt like it was my home.	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ me fie.
So much easier.	Enti ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
That morning then, and this morning now.	Saa anɔpa no saa bere no, ne anɔpa yi mprempren.
Most of them went out this morning.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara fii adi anɔpa yi.
It’s my right.	Ɛyɛ me hokwan.
And in a not-too-fun way too.	Na wɔ ɔkwan a ɛnyɛ anigye dodo so nso.
This makes it easier.	Eyi ma ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
It doesn’t work that well.	Ɛnyɛ yiye saa.
Or whatever it is.	Anaasɛ nea ɛte biara.
He was excited.	Ná n’ani agye.
No one knows what he is.	Obiara nnim nea ɔyɛ.
I need to do this for me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi ma me.
That said, everything is working fine.	Ɛno akyi no, biribiara reyɛ adwuma yiye.
I could have done without it.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ saa a, anka metumi ayɛ saa.
And they are them.	Na wɔyɛ wɔn.
He glared at the boy.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ abarimaa no anim.
Just an idea.	Adwene bi kɛkɛ.
However, that information is now available to anything.	Nanso, mprempren biribiara betumi anya saa nsɛm no.
How long was that.	Bere tenten ahe na na ɛte saa.
This great work comes into play here.	Saa adwuma kɛse yi ba asɛm no mu wɔ ha.
It wasn’t much money, but it was then.	Na ɛnyɛ sika pii, nanso na ɛyɛ saa bere no.
Everything is you want them there.	Biribiara ne sɛ wopɛ wɔn wɔ hɔ.
However, it is not beautiful.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ fɛ.
There were no windows either.	Ná mfɛnsere biara nso nni hɔ.
Man is beautiful with himself.	Onipa ne ne ho yɛ fɛ.
They will certainly make mistakes themselves.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔn ankasa bedi mfomso.
I can’t reach out to him.	Mintumi mfa me nsa nkɔ ne nkyɛn.
This is when it is at its best.	Eyi ne bere a ɛwɔ nea eye sen biara mu.
Nothing has ever looked so good.	Biribiara nyɛɛ nea ɛte sɛ nea eye saa da.
Many people pass through this city every day.	Nnipa pii fa kurow yi mu da biara.
There was so much to do.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He knows and yet he doesn’t.	Onim na nanso onnim.
This was not easy for him.	Ná eyi nyɛ mmerɛw mma no.
That didn’t happen right away.	Ɛno amma ntɛm ara.
I don’t even know what that was.	Minnim nea na ɛno yɛ mpo.
He didn’t like her.	Ná n’ani nnye ne ho.
And it's finally over now.	Na aba awiei koraa mprempren.
I think that was the idea anyway.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno ne adwene no wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
But only for a moment.	Nanso bere bi pɛ.
It’s great and inexpensive.	Ɛyɛ kɛse na ne bo nyɛ den.
He was not terrible.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hu.
He was excited	Ná n’ani gye
Maybe you should do that.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
On the street.	Wɔ abɔnten so.
It’s everything to us at this point.	Ɛyɛ biribiara ma yɛn wɔ saa bere yi mu.
Some days you remember it well.	Nna bi wɔ hɔ a wokae no yiye.
Beware of them.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ wɔn ho.
It’s not a good thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade pa.
For the most part, my hair feels great.	Wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu no, me ti nhwi te nka sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ.
It has only one way.	Ɛwɔ ɔkwan biako pɛ.
Talk about mind control.	Ka adwene so tumi ho asɛm.
This was a different story.	Ná eyi yɛ asɛm foforo.
And my children, too.	Na me mma nso.
It was the coldest night of the summer.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo a awɔw wom sen biara wɔ awɔw bere mu.
I can’t see what’s going on with you.	Me ntumi nhu nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ wo so.
The day wasn’t going too well.	Ná da no nkɔ yiye dodo.
For now, at least.	Mprempren de, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
Without water, there would be no life.	Sɛ nsu nni hɔ a, anka nkwa nni hɔ.
But of course he did.	Nanso ampa ara ɔyɛɛ saa.
I can’t believe how amazing the still images are.	Mintumi nnye nni sɛnea mfonini ahorow a ɛda hɔ no yɛ nwonwa no.
Many people argued with me.	Nnipa pii ne me gyee akyinnye.
I’d appreciate your help.	M’ani begye wo mmoa ho.
It seems to be everyone’s biggest song.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ obiara dwom kɛse.
It was no big deal.	Ná ɛnyɛ ade kɛse biara.
Take a walk through the city.	Fa nantew fa kurow no mu.
He’s a good dog.	Ɔyɛ ɔkraman pa.
What you are doing or planning to do is ?	Nea woreyɛ anaa woayɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ wobɛyɛ ne sɛ ?
No one sees us.	Obiara nhu yɛn.
You are.	Woyɛ.
So, it’s pretty scary.	Enti, ɛyɛ hu yiye.
It was never an issue.	Ná ɛnyɛ asɛm da.
I will refer you to someone who may know the name.	Mede wo bɛkɔ obi a ebia onim din no nkyɛn.
It might be my favorite thing ever.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ ade a m’ani gye ho kɛse pɛn.
Children need to be careful.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra hwɛ yiye.
It is still very expensive.	Ɛda so ara yɛ nea ne bo yɛ den yiye.
I am sorry about your mother.	Mepa wo yaw wɔ wo maame ho.
We can, we must, and we will do well.	Yebetumi, ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa, na yɛbɛyɛ yiye.
I have a lot of it.	Mewɔ pii.
Both of these things don't work.	Saa nneɛma abien yi nyinaa nyɛ adwuma.
His such beautiful clothes and everything else.	Ne ntade a ɛyɛ fɛ a ɛte saa ne biribiara a aka.
So does he, too.	Saa ara na ɔno nso yɛ.
Wear your best form like a suit.	Hyɛ wo tebea a eye sen biara no te sɛ atade.
Or one day.	Anaasɛ da koro.
Or something like that, anyway.	Anaasɛ biribi a ɛte saa, ɔkwan biara so.
I've only done it a few times.	Mayɛ no mpɛn kakraa bi pɛ.
But what a game it was.	Nanso hwɛ agoru a na ɛyɛ.
This is the result.	Eyi aba.
However, the man kept going.	Nanso, ɔbarima no kɔɔ so yɛɛ saa.
A car off the road.	Kar bi a afi kwan no so akɔ.
I feel beautiful.	Mete nka sɛ me ho yɛ fɛ.
It’s too early.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo.
That means nothing to a child.	Ɛno nkyerɛ hwee mma abofra.
This surprises me.	Eyi yɛ me nwonwa.
I had no time for him.	Ná minni bere mma no.
Take control of them.	Di wɔn so.
The girl liked the girl.	Abeawa no ani gyee abeawa no ho.
Keep telling yourself that.	Kɔ so ka saa kyerɛ wo ho.
Household chores are not necessary.	Ofie nnwuma ho nhia.
Did the bus come today?	So bɔs no baa nnɛ?
I never wanted him to.	Ná mempɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa da.
I wish it wasn’t.	Me yam a anka ɛnte saa.
I know he will do great.	Minim sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ade kɛse.
Using the latest version is fine.	Sɛ wode nea aba foforo no di dwuma a, eye.
Things kept getting better.	Nneɛma kɔɔ so yɛɛ yiye.
You didn’t have to be a professional.	Ná enhia sɛ woyɛ obi a onim adwuma yiye.
And it was a wonderful thing.	Na na ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Your hair looks great.	Wo ti nhwi no yɛ fɛ yiye.
Don’t tell anyone about the accident.	Mma akwanhyia no ho asɛm nkyerɛ obiara.
This would be the monster.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ aboa kɛse no.
Both would be equal.	Anka abien no nyinaa bɛyɛ pɛ.
They do their job.	Wɔyɛ wɔn adwuma.
They also do a great job.	Wɔyɛ adwuma kɛse nso.
It was like my home.	Ná ɛte sɛ me fie.
I headed to the back of the room.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ dan no akyi.
But it’s fun.	Nanso ɛyɛ anigye.
It was not his favorite room.	Ná ɛnyɛ dan a n’ani gye ho paa.
Just too, too.	Kɛkɛ nso.
Sleep is important.	Nna ho hia.
Just one bad day.	Da bɔne biako pɛ.
The other two were seated.	Ná baanu a aka no te hɔ.
They just do it	Wɔyɛ ara ne sɛ .
Everyone else does.	Obiara a aka no yɛ saa.
There is nothing about him.	Ne ho hwee nni hɔ.
People know us.	Nkurɔfo nim yɛn.
Things are not as they seem.	Nneɛma nte sɛnea ɛte no.
I'm not doing that.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ mereyɛ saa.
However, it was not as good as the real thing.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ papa te sɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa no.
He was told that it was one of his own.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛyɛ ne de mu biako.
But, that’s what the police do.	Nanso, ɛno ne nea polisifo yɛ.
But he had, and he would tomorrow.	Nanso na ɔwɔ, na ɔkyena nso na ɔbɛyɛ.
That is if he wants help.	Ɛno ne sɛ ɔpɛ mmoa a.
I was a bad boy.	Ná meyɛ abarimaa bɔne.
You know, be careful with that.	Wunim, hwɛ yiye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
She knew nothing about this man, not even his name.	Ná onnim ɔbarima yi ho hwee, na na onnim ne din mpo.
He will make a bed.	Ɔbɛyɛ mpa.
This just brought a lot of excitement to the room.	Eyi de anigye pii baa dan no mu ara kwa.
He will tell you that it is true.	Ɔbɛka akyerɛ wo sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
Accept him as your child.	Gye no tom sɛ wo ba.
But it’s not my fault.	Nanso ɛnyɛ me mfomso.
They are not the problem.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn ne ɔhaw no.
That’s why it’s always voted on.	Ɛno nti na wɔde to aba bere nyinaa no.
And as you said look at the end of the day.	Na sɛnea wokae no hwɛ da no awiei.
He is a very handsome man both inside and out.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye wɔ ne mu ne akyi nyinaa.
Old, but solid.	Dedaw, nanso ɛyɛ den.
He shouldn’t have done that.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I want to know what you think about it.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea wususuw wɔ ho.
I can 't quite say it.	Mintumi 'ntumi nka no yiye.
This is truly remarkable.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
. . . .	.
The same will be true today.	Saa ara na ɛbɛyɛ saa nnɛ.
This is not difficult.	Eyi nyɛ den.
He was a little weak.	Ná ɔyɛ mmerɛw kakra.
But that’s another story.	Nanso ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo.
Nothing did, for what seemed like a long time.	Biribiara anyɛ saa, wɔ nea na ɛte sɛ bere tenten no mu.
There are no cars outside.	Kar biara nni abɔnten.
He is no longer the first.	Ɔnyɛ nea odi kan bio.
This is what is most important to me.	Eyi ne nea ɛho hia me sen biara.
There is no effort.	Mmɔden biara nni hɔ.
The two work as one.	Nnipa baanu no yɛ adwuma sɛ biako.
He doesn’t look familiar.	Ɔnyɛ sɛ obi a onim no yiye.
He certainly looked like her.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔte sɛ ɔno.
I should have done something.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi.
Everyone here knows.	Obiara a ɔwɔ ha nim.
You have time to.	Wowɔ bere a.
It’s also their big day.	Ɛyɛ wɔn da kɛse no nso.
I thought the same thing.	Misusuwii saa ara.
They are not the problem.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn ne ɔhaw no.
There is no reason to do so.	Biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Everybody just played music.	Obiara bɔɔ nnwom kɛkɛ.
It was hard for him, too.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma no nso.
They are all every human being.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ onipa biara.
I actually had a little bit of fun.	Me nyaa anigye kakra ankasa.
I have no control over it at this time.	Minni tumi biara wɔ so saa bere yi.
When do you want this?	Bere bɛn na wopɛ eyi?
I need to feel him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete ne nka.
Somehow it’s great.	Ɔkwan bi so no ɛyɛ kɛse.
I feel kind of bad, but he doesn’t know me.	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ bɔne bi, nanso onnim me.
The drought situation continues.	Ɔpɛ tebea no kɔ so.
But he wasn’t.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ saa.
The new stuff is still not there.	Nneɛma foforo no da so ara nni hɔ.
I don't have money.	Minni sika.
But this is becoming more common.	Nanso eyi reyɛ ayɛ nea abu so kɛse.
They were thrilled.	Wɔn ani gyee ho.
It’s like this.	Ɛte sɛ eyi.
None of these things are here.	Nneɛma yi mu biara nni ha.
How comfortable you are is what matters.	Sɛnea wo ho bɛtɔ wo no ne nea ɛho hia.
Think about this carefully.	Susuw eyi ho yiye.
Look don’t forget their kids.	Hwɛ wo werɛ mfi wɔn mma.
People give you permission to do it.	Nkurɔfo ma wo kwan ma woyɛ.
I can't tell you anything else.	Mintumi nka biribi foforo biara nkyerɛ wo.
For a moment, things look good.	Wɔ bere tiaa bi mu no, nneɛma hwɛ yiye.
He is a great guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse bi.
But it is often difficult.	Nanso mpɛn pii no, ɛyɛ den.
I just felt like.	Metee nka ara kwa sɛ.
The problem is, no one really knows what they want.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ, obiara nnim nea ɔpɛ ankasa.
All the way down.	Ɔkwan no nyinaa so kɔ fam.
We can’t do that yet.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ saa de besi nnɛ.
This was very important to me.	Ná eyi ho hia me paa.
But it used to be a little difficult.	Nanso kan no na ɛyɛ den kakra.
Anyone could have looked into it from there.	Anka obiara betumi afi hɔ ahwɛ mu.
I look forward to that day.	Mehwɛ saa da no kwan.
I think there will be more stories to come.	Misusuw sɛ nsɛm pii bɛkɔ so aba.
It looks like there is a party going on down there.	Ɛte sɛ nea apontow bi rekɔ so wɔ fam hɔ.
It’s a bit like our situation.	Ɛte sɛ yɛn tebea no kakra.
This species is critically endangered.	Saa aboa yi wɔ asiane kɛse mu.
You rely on him.	Wode wo ho to no so.
I know they do.	Minim sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
You are incredibly strong.	Wo ho yɛ den a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
You can do anything and he is so great.	Wubetumi ayɛ biribiara na ɔyɛ saa kɛse.
And I did that.	Na meyɛɛ saa.
It might be better.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa.
Each method has its drawbacks.	Ɔkwan biara wɔ ɔhaw ahorow.
I actually keep going.	Mekɔ so ankasa.
What a trivial problem.	Ɔhaw a ɛnyɛ hwee bɛn ara ni.
But that’s the way it is.	Nanso saa na ɛte.
But it had happened.	Nanso na asi.
If your baby starts crying, just hit him.	Sɛ wo ba no fi ase su a, bɔ no kɛkɛ.
It was him.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔno.
I just feed it.	Mede aduan ara kwa.
That was the way it was.	Saa na na ɛte.
The project was a success.	Adwuma no dii yiye.
Run as fast as you can.	Tu mmirika ntɛmntɛm sɛnea wubetumi.
For every problem, their test works.	Wɔ ɔhaw biara mu no, wɔn sɔhwɛ no yɛ adwuma.
It just exists.	Ɛwɔ hɔ ara kwa.
We’ve all done a pretty good job of it.	Yɛn nyinaa ayɛ adwuma pa ara wɔ ho.
He doesn’t like me.	Ɔmpɛ me asɛm.
This dress is too tight for me.	Saa atade yi yɛ den dodo ma me.
I never should have brought him here.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mede no ba ha da.
But few do.	Nanso kakraa bi na wɔyɛ saa.
But that is not possible.	Nanso ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
This doesn’t apply to you.	Eyi mfa wo ho.
People were happy, excited.	Ná nkurɔfo ani agye, na wɔn ani agye.
But no one knew what to do.	Nanso na obiara nnim nea ɔbɛyɛ.
However, you are here now.	Nanso, wowɔ ha mprempren.
And how wonderful it felt to have him in my arms again.	Na hwɛ sɛnea na ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ metee nka sɛ ɔwɔ me nsa so bio.
It wasn’t real.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Or at least I felt busy.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, metee nka sɛ meyɛ obi a onni adagyew.
I have no idea how fast this car will go.	Minnim sɛnea kar yi bɛkɔ ntɛmntɛm no ho adwene biara.
This was just what you needed to know.	Ná eyi yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ wunim ara kwa.
This seemed strange.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ nwonwa.
Nor was there ever a moon.	Saa ara nso na na ɔsram biara nni hɔ da.
I felt bad for them.	Metee nka bɔne wɔ wɔn ho.
In due course of time.	Wɔ bere a ɛsɛ mu.
Most of everything, you might say.	Biribiara mu dodow no ara, ebia wobɛka.
That’s what they should be doing.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
We will do the same.	Yɛbɛyɛ saa ara.
I know you have it.	Minim sɛ wowɔ.
Without a doubt, he should.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
It may be dangerous.	Ebia asiane wom.
Water is water.	Nsu yɛ nsu.
That could be the case here as well.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ saa wɔ ha nso.
. . . .	.
They tell me this all the time.	Wɔka eyi kyerɛ me bere nyinaa.
There is no way.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ.
You have to believe me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye me di.
It was not in his nature to do so.	Na ɛnyɛ ne su mu sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I didn't know if I should expect it or not.	Ná minnim sɛ ebia ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ kwan anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
But if you don’t know if you’re doing it right.	Nanso sɛ wunnim sɛ woreyɛ no yiye a.
It’s a beautiful setting.	Ɛyɛ tebea a ɛyɛ fɛ.
This is not a surprise.	Eyi nyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
A little thought, please.	Adwene kakra, mesrɛ wo.
One can do it back and forth.	Obi betumi ayɛ no akɔ anim ne akyi.
I think that was important.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno ho hia.
We are on our post-dinner walk.	Yɛwɔ yɛn anwummere aduan akyi nantew no so.
You were like a boy.	Ná woyɛ sɛ abarimaa.
What are these people out of their minds.	Dɛn ne saa nkurɔfo yi afi wɔn adwene mu.
Stay for the food.	Tra hɔ ma aduan no.
For a moment, it was a happy time.	Bere tiaa bi no, na ɛyɛ anigye bere.
He seemed too strong for that.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ den dodo ma ɛno.
He had made a plan.	Ná wayɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
You’ll be interested.	W’ani begye ho.
The group was poorly organized.	Ná kuw no nni nhyehyɛe pa.
I have to be careful too.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me nso mehwɛ yiye.
Legs were too short.	Ná nan yɛ tiaa dodo.
Get involved in it.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu.
He has his hand in everything.	Ɔwɔ ne nsa wɔ biribiara mu.
There is still much to be done.	Nneɛma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
A lot of that.	Ɛno mu pii.
The arrangements went well.	Nhyehyɛe ahorow no kɔɔ yiye.
When they do, it’s great.	Sɛ wɔyɛ a, ɛyɛ kɛse.
The morning was cold.	Ná awɔw wom anɔpa no.
The stuff he used looked good.	Ná nneɛma a ɔde di dwuma no hwɛ sɛ eye.
I couldn’t see anything.	Ná mintumi nhu biribiara.
That was another exciting time.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere foforo a ɛyɛ anigye.
Again, it was a sleepless night.	Ɛno nso, na ɛyɛ anadwo a obiara nna.
That’s clear enough.	Ɛno mu da hɔ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Play games and spend money.	Di agoru na fa sika di dwuma.
They appreciate that you are so good with kids.	Wɔn ani gye sɛ wo ne mmofra yɛ papa paa.
Nothing left is real or true.	Biribiara nni hɔ a aka a ɛyɛ nokware anaa ɛyɛ nokware.
In his power.	Wɔ ne tumi mu.
Maybe he was wrong.	Ebia na odi mfomso.
Why he did that, no one now knows.	Nea enti a ɔyɛɛ saa no, mprempren obiara nnim.
There is a great deal to be done.	Ade kɛse bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
That doesn’t work.	Ɛno ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
But here, there was something here.	Nanso ha, na biribi wɔ ha.
It was late at night.	Ná anadwo adu.
Or whatever it is.	Anaasɛ nea ɛte biara.
Remember when you were very young.	Kae bere a na woyɛ abofra koraa no.
That it wasn’t as bad as it really was.	Sɛ na ɛnyɛ bɔne sɛnea na ɛte ankasa no.
He is a wonderful person.	Ɔyɛ onipa a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
And one day, he does.	Na da koro bi, ɔyɛ saa.
He was a weakling.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw.
It’s not that you don’t like it, you just think you don’t like it.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ w’ani nnye, wususuw ara ne sɛ w’ani nnye ho.
Make everything right.	Ma biribiara nyɛ yiye.
Letter, letter, letter.	Krataa, krataa, krataa.
That’s a pretty big deal.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse bi.
One of the animals is a dog.	Mmoa no mu biako yɛ kraman.
He just gets involved.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu ara kwa.
This is not necessary.	Eyi ho nhia.
The rest will come as it happens.	Nea aka no bɛba bere a ɛrekɔ so no.
He looked down at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ fam.
You probably know that.	Ebia wunim saa.
But that’s how it is with man.	Nanso saa na ɛyɛ onipa.
His wife and children are here.	Ne yere ne ne mma wɔ ha.
There is no doubt about that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
That kid was amazing.	Ná saa abofra no yɛ nwonwa.
There is nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
A girl who was in control and could do whatever she wanted.	Abeawa a na odi so na obetumi ayɛ biribiara a ɔpɛ.
So was the girl.	Saa ara na na abeawa no nso te.
You are doing all you can to help them.	Woreyɛ nea wubetumi biara de aboa wɔn.
I disagree with most of what you say.	Me ne nea woka no mu dodow no ara nyɛ adwene.
Can we see other forms of life?	So yebetumi ahu nkwa ahorow foforo?
Did he do that.	So na ɔyɛ saa.
This time though.	Saa bere yi nanso.
There seemed likely to be more to the story.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ pii wɔ asɛm no mu.
You can go then.	Wubetumi akɔ saa bere no.
You are a good mother.	Woyɛ maame pa.
Someone who mattered didn’t like it.	Obi a na ɛho hia no ani nnye ho.
And that is still true today.	Na ɛno da so ara yɛ nokware nnɛ.
He seemed excited about something.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye biribi ho.
Get people to agree with you.	Ma nkurɔfo ne wo nyɛ adwene.
I can't see it too well.	Mintumi nhu no yiye dodo.
All the characteristics.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ mu nyinaa.
There were people in the house.	Ná nnipa wɔ fie hɔ.
I love the city every day.	M’ani gye kurow no ho da biara da.
And that’s a great thing.	Na ɛno yɛ ade kɛse.
Maybe never.	Ebia ɛnyɛ da.
It had to feel authentic.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
I felt bad for both of them.	Ná ɛyɛ me yaw wɔ wɔn baanu nyinaa ho.
Children can see each other.	Mmofra tumi hu wɔn ho wɔn ho.
I '.	ME '.
His books are amazing.	Ne nhoma ahorow no yɛ nwonwa.
I’d love to work this out for you.	M’ani begye sɛ mɛyɛ eyi ho adwuma ama mo.
I always do the same thing.	Meyɛ saa ara bere nyinaa.
Enjoy the view for a moment.	Fa w’ani gye sɛnea wubetumi ahu no ho bere tiaa bi.
I’m happy with myself now.	M’ani gye me ho mprempren.
You can’t imagine it.	Worentumi nsusuw ho.
Maybe he would do that.	Ebia na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I’m very happy to say that now, we are.	M’ani agye yiye sɛ mɛka sɛ mprempren, yɛwɔ hɔ.
However, this is a mistake.	Nanso, eyi yɛ mfomso.
No one knew why.	Na obiara nnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
I forgot about you too.	Me nso me werɛ fii wo.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ.
So that creates some problems.	Enti ɛno de ɔhaw ahorow bi ba.
Man knows he knows.	Onipa nim sɛ onim.
It was a great pleasure to be there.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye kɛse sɛ mewɔ hɔ.
Another experiment made the same point.	Sɔhwɛ foforo nso kaa asɛm koro no ara.
That’s what it was supposed to be.	Saa na na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
Not even a new house.	Ɛnyɛ ofie foforo mpo.
You can only do what is in your power.	Nea ɛwɔ wo tumi mu nkutoo na wubetumi ayɛ.
More is at work than you know.	Pii wɔ adwuma mu sen sɛnea wunim.
It’s just a great story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse bi kɛkɛ.
So, we.	Enti, yɛn.
Get involved a little bit.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu kakra.
All of these things are important to me.	Saa nneɛma yi nyinaa ho hia me.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho.
Or maybe it’s you.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛyɛ wo.
Your schedule will be difficult.	Wo nhyehyɛe bɛyɛ den.
I know these cars very well.	Me nim saa kar ahorow yi yiye.
Just think about what you are doing.	Susuw nea woreyɛ no ho kɛkɛ.
What a sin it is for them.	Hwɛ bɔne a ɛyɛ ma wɔn.
I'll give you a few bucks.	Mede sika kakraa bi bɛma wo.
I’m interested in everyone.	M’ani gye obiara ho.
Even so it was crazy fast.	Ɛno mpo no na ɛyɛ kraman ntɛmntɛm.
We have no idea about it.	Yɛn adwene biara nni ho.
There is no house quite like this anywhere else.	Ofie biara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ eyi koraa wɔ baabi foforo biara.
And they were fun, for the most part.	Na na wɔyɛ anigye, wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu.
That’s a great thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade kɛse.
Finally he nodded.	Awiei koraa no ɔde ne ti too fam.
What’s in it, and how do we know?.	Dɛn na ɛwɔ mu, na yɛbɛyɛ dɛn ahu?.
He just did it.	Ɔyɛɛ saa ara kwa.
And that was exactly what he wanted.	Na ɛno ne ade ankasa a na ɔpɛ.
At least there was a window.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na mfɛnsere bi wɔ hɔ.
Better than nothing, definitely.	Ɛyɛ papa sen sɛ biribiara nni hɔ, akyinnye biara nni ho.
And it was nothing else.	Na ɛnyɛ biribi foforo.
But it may not be.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
That was their first mistake.	Ɛno ne wɔn mfomso a edi kan.
I remained friends with him.	Me ne no kɔɔ so traa nnamfo.
Someone really has to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ saa ankasa.
Something has to be done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi.
It was a wonderful addition to our team.	Na ɛyɛ ade foforo a ɛyɛ nwonwa a wɔde aka yɛn kuw no ho.
The mind can never figure this out.	Adwene no ntumi nsusuw eyi ho da.
That should be the case.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ saa.
Show them the story and leave.	Kyerɛ wɔn asɛm no na fi hɔ kɔ.
I know he doesn’t.	Minim sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
Many of them are working two or three jobs.	Wɔn mu pii reyɛ adwuma abien anaa abiɛsa.
I think a lot of people do those things.	Misusuw sɛ nnipa pii yɛ saa nneɛma no.
But if they did, that would be great.	Nanso sɛ wɔyɛ saa a, anka ɛno bɛyɛ kɛse.
Only part of the car is underwater.	Kar no fã bi pɛ na ɛwɔ nsu ase.
I didn’t want to stay in the house.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mekɔ so tra fie hɔ.
Who can help me?	Hena na obetumi aboa me?
He nodded to the two.	Ɔde ne ti too fam kyerɛɛ nnipa baanu no.
I didn’t know you could do this.	Na minnim sɛ wubetumi ayɛ eyi.
Which is true.	Nea ɛyɛ nokware.
It’s a good plan, he told himself.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe pa, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho.
They all play a role.	Wɔn nyinaa di dwuma bi.
Both are quite simple.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ mmerɛw koraa.
he says that.	ɔka sɛ.
It seems that.	Ɛte sɛ nea.
You can work alone.	Wo nkutoo betumi ayɛ adwuma.
He was in desperate need of someone for the job.	Ná ɔpɛ obi kɛse ma adwuma no.
But this week it was one after the other.	Nanso dapɛn yi na ɛyɛ biako akyi biako.
He wanted to be with her tonight.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne no tra anadwo yi.
I don’t want them.	Mempɛ wɔn.
Make it as good as you can.	Ma ɛnyɛ papa sɛnea wubetumi biara.
It wasn’t difficult.	Ná ɛnyɛ den.
No one realized how important he was.	Obiara anhu sɛnea na ne ho hia no.
She seemed more beautiful in his eyes.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛɛ fɛ kɛse wɔ n’ani so.
There was a man on the floor.	Ná ɔbarima bi wɔ fam hɔ.
That is the most compelling conclusion of this paper.	Ɛno ne krataa yi awiei a ɛyɛ den sen biara.
But that was .	Nanso na ɛno ne .
Go to work.	Kɔ adwuma mu.
None in the latter.	Obiara nni nea etwa to no mu.
You’re not feeling well.	Wo ho nyɛ wo den.
Money is the conduit of all evil.	Sika ne ɔkwan a bɔne nyinaa fa so.
Look at his hands.	Hwɛ ne nsa.
It wasn’t easy.	Ná ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
But there was a truth.	Nanso na nokware bi wɔ hɔ.
You can background program in it.	Wubetumi ayɛ akyi nhyehyɛe wɔ mu.
Money is still very important to most of us.	Sika da so ara ho hia yɛn mu dodow no ara kɛse.
He has to make the new one.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ foforo no.
I want to put it aside for a moment.	Mepɛ sɛ mede to nkyɛn kakra.
Something fell on him.	Biribi hwee ne so.
So you can use that.	Enti wubetumi de saa asɛm no adi dwuma.
We both turned to him.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa dan kɔɔ ne nkyɛn.
This quality, no doubt, is shared by all of them.	Saa su yi, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, wɔ wɔn nyinaa mu.
How will you use it?	Wobɛyɛ dɛn de adi dwuma?
I've had it for about a year.	Mewɔ no bɛyɛ afe ni.
He is not a nice guy.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It was happening again.	Ná ɛrekɔ so bio.
He sang with a smile.	Ɔde anigye too dwom.
None of them had that.	Wɔn mu biara nni hɔ a na ɔwɔ saa.
For me it doesn’t matter.	Me fam no ɛnyɛ hwee.
I know it has to be.	Minim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
Very bad night too.	Anadwo bɔne paa nso.
He was great in the first season or two.	Ɔyɛɛ kɛse wɔ bere anaa abien a edi kan no mu.
I can’t take any right now.	Mintumi nnye biara mprempren.
He really knows me.	Onim me ankasa.
This time it was my mother.	Saa bere yi de na ɛyɛ me maame.
I saw him doing that.	Mihuu no sɛ ɔreyɛ saa.
Take that issue.	Fa saa asɛm no.
That’s an opportunity there.	Ɛno ne hokwan bi wɔ hɔ.
Wasn’t that the truth.	So na ɛnyɛ nokware no.
They seem to enjoy a few.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani gye kakraa bi ho.
It’s just fun to play around with.	Ɛyɛ anigye ara kwa sɛ wobɛka ho agoru.
She was just beautiful in it.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ ara kwa wɔ mu.
It just wasn’t happening.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
You really need to think about this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw eyi ho ankasa.
This situation is not uncommon.	Saa tebea yi nyɛ ade foforo.
This point is not important.	Saa asɛm yi nyɛ nea ɛho hia.
It’s great for us.	Ɛyɛ kɛse ma yɛn.
Our time is up.	Yɛn bere atwam.
You were in the background.	Ná wowɔ akyi hɔ.
Just show your support below.	Kyerɛ wo mmoa wɔ ase hɔ ara kwa.
I saw this.	Mihuu eyi.
His name was unknown.	Ná ne din nnim.
But they all have the same characteristics.	Nanso wɔn nyinaa wɔ su koro.
He's just an idea now.	Ɔyɛ adwene bi kɛkɛ mprempren.
This was generally not a problem.	Mpɛn pii no eyi anyɛ ɔhaw.
I want you to talk to us.	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne yɛn kasa.
So he didn’t seem to know exactly what his name was.	Enti ɛte sɛ nea na onnim nea ne din de no yiye.
I am still living there.	Meda so ara te hɔ.
That that had happened.	Sɛ na ɛno asi.
And he didn’t know why.	Na na onnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
He knew it, too.	Ná ɔno nso nim.
We put him down again.	Yɛde no too fam bio.
Bad month, that was it.	Ɔsram bɔne, na ɛno ne.
Most people now drive.	Mprempren nnipa dodow no ara de kar kɔ.
I can’t even.	Mintumi mpo.
It’s the best!.	Ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara!.
It was amazing inside.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ mu.
There is no rigid format for this paper	Krataa yi ho nhyehyɛe a ɛyɛ den biara nni hɔ
I'm in trouble here.	Mewɔ ɔhaw mu wɔ ha.
A first for each of us.	Nea edi kan ma yɛn mu biara.
Thank you for the many years of music you have given me.	Meda wo ase wɔ mfe pii a wode ayɛ nnwom a wode ama me no ho.
You may think of the person.	Ebia wususuw onipa no ho.
He wasn’t perfect at all.	Ná ɔnyɛ pɛ koraa.
Kids are always getting in trouble.	Mmofra rekɔ ɔhaw mu bere nyinaa.
But it may be too late.	Nanso ebia aka akyi dodo.
Can you help?.	So wubetumi aboa?.
This would have been better.	Anka eyi bɛyɛ papa.
Count your years in dog years.	Kan wo mfe wɔ kraman mfe mu.
You've done that too many times.	Woayɛ saa mpɛn pii dodo.
So you have to trust me.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ wugye me di.
But without time, that means nothing.	Nanso sɛ bere nni hɔ a, ɛno nkyerɛ hwee.
He wanted to touch her.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka no.
Like an addict, he was very jealous.	Te sɛ obi a ɔde ne ho ahyɛ mu no, na n’ani bere pii.
He has already given it to you.	Ɔde ama wo dedaw.
Something would happen tomorrow.	Ná biribi bɛba ɔkyena.
You remember it all.	Wokae ne nyinaa.
The point is, you don’t really want to do this.	Asɛm no ne sɛ, wompɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi ankasa.
Things like	Nneɛma te sɛ .
I have such a strong team.	Mewɔ kuw a ɛyɛ den saa.
Are you with me?.	So wo ne me wɔ hɔ?.
I agree that there might be a problem.	Migye tom sɛ ebia ɔhaw bi bɛba.
What a wonderful day.	Da a ɛyɛ anigye bɛn ara ni.
If you do, this is for you.	Sɛ woyɛ saa a, eyi yɛ ma wo.
I need to act quickly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ho biribi ntɛm.
But it was also in him.	Nanso na ɛwɔ ne mu nso.
There is still much to be done.	Nneɛma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
But it wasn’t the present moment.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ mprempren bere no.
Our team will be there tomorrow.	Yɛn kuw no bɛba hɔ ɔkyena.
I'm using it.	Mede di dwuma.
I have two classes.	Mewɔ adesua ahorow abien.
A number of people use this currency.	Nnipa dodow bi na wɔde saa sika yi di dwuma.
Please don’t lie to me, ever.	Mesrɛ wo, nni atoro nkyerɛ me, da.
She is very beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
If you want to know.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ wuhu a.
Please don’t let a bad end come to him.	Mesrɛ wo, mma awiei bɔne mma ne so.
I truly believe you have enough information here for another book.	Migye di ampa sɛ wowɔ nsɛm a ɛdɔɔso wɔ ha ma nhoma foforo.
Unsurprisingly, this is not what this looks like, at all.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ eyi nyɛ nea eyi te, koraa.
You can totally do it, too.	Wubetumi ayɛ no koraa, nso.
People think they do.	Nkurɔfo susuw sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
A terrible movie.	Sini a ɛyɛ hu.
It’s so obvious.	Ɛda adi saa.
Nothing else needs to be done.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ biribi foforo biara.
No one knew the child was in the room.	Ná obiara nnim sɛ abofra no wɔ dan no mu.
His hands touched his hands.	Ne nsa kaa ne nsa.
It should never have been done.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no da.
My mother was like that.	Ná me maame te saa.
No one ever knows .	Obi nnim da .
Not every time.	Ɛnyɛ bere biara.
A great guy.	Ɔbarima kɛse bi.
He knew what he had planned.	Ná onim nea wayɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
This is what he had done.	Eyi na na wayɛ.
Maybe it’s not that surprising.	Ebia ɛnyɛ nwonwa saa.
You're just fine, just keep doing what you've been doing.	Woayɛ yiye ara kwa, kɔ so yɛ nea woayɛ no ara kwa.
What matters is what he does with them’.	Nea ɛho hia ne nea ɔde wɔn bɛyɛ’.
It was a good decision.	Ná ɛyɛ gyinae pa.
His father evidently had money.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ne papa wɔ sika.
He told himself so.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho saa.
I don't really know how to get into this.	Minnim sɛnea mɛkɔ eyi mu ankasa.
I really believe it.	Migye di ampa.
And if	Na sɛ .
To me, it was all beautiful and perfect.	Wɔ me fam no, na ne nyinaa yɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ pɛ.
I saw that.	Mihuu saa.
You don’t have to go alone.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wo nkutoo kɔ.
Please go with me, let me go alone.	Mesrɛ wo, wo ne me nkɔ, ma me nkutoo nkɔ.
This error keeps showing up.	Saa mfomso yi kɔ so da adi.
Like, everybody knows that.	Te sɛ, obiara nim saa.
Everything in her house matters.	Ade biara a ɛwɔ ne fie no ho hia.
There was no time to do much.	Ná bere nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ pii.
He was just in a situation.	Ná ɔwɔ tebea bi mu ara kwa.
This was the case.	Ná eyi te saa.
He is always punctual.	Odi bere so yiye bere nyinaa.
I want to do things for myself.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nneɛma ma me ho.
How he handles meetings.	Sɛnea odi nhyiam ahorow ho dwuma.
For each of us.	Yɛn mu biara nti.
There are a number of factors.	Nneɛma ahorow bi wɔ hɔ.
They are placed at your feet for a song.	Wɔde to wo nan ase ma dwom.
Work environment .	Adwuma mu tebea .
But nothing happened.	Nanso biribiara amma.
It was very easy to use.	Ná ɛnyɛ den koraa sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma.
It’s only real if both people feel it.	Ɛyɛ biribi ankasa nkutoo sɛ nnipa baanu no nyinaa te nka a.
The truth is the truth.	Nokware no ne nokware no.
I never wanted to go there in the first place.	Na mempɛ sɛ mɛkɔ hɔ da wɔ nea edi kan no mu.
I can’t seem to figure it out.	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nsusuw ho.
He was perfect.	Ná ɔyɛ pɛ.
He will help us.	Ɔbɛboa yɛn.
Almost my opinion.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ m’adwene.
Time goes on.	Bere kɔ so.
You know you want one.	Wunim sɛ wopɛ biako.
He stepped into the room.	Ɔde ne nan sii dan no mu.
I can believe it.	Metumi agye adi.
Paper products are used for a variety of purposes.	Wɔde nneɛma a wɔde krataa ayɛ di dwuma de yɛ nneɛma ahorow.
You were exhausted.	Ná wo ho ayɛ wo hyew.
We can travel.	Yebetumi atu kwan.
Be very careful.	Hwɛ yiye paa.
It has elements of the old and the new.	Ɛwɔ dedaw ne foforo no mu nneɛma bi.
Sure, anything is just possible.	Ampa, biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye ara kwa.
He likes to work outside.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma wɔ abɔnten.
He played with his children.	Ɔne ne mma dii agoru.
It just costs the thing.	Ɛho ka ara kwa ne ade no.
This cannot be the case.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ saa.
He never does that.	Ɔnyɛ saa da.
He looked at her coldly.	Ɔde awɔw hwɛɛ no.
That’s how many people will buy his mind.	Saa na nnipa pii bɛtɔ n’adwene.
As it was he didn't really know if anything was actually going on.	Sɛnea na ɛte no na onnim ankasa sɛ ebia biribi rekɔ so ankasa anaa.
That said, there might not be much of a story.	Ɛno akyi no, ebia na asɛm no pii nni hɔ.
I know you are doing your best.	Minim sɛ woreyɛ nea wubetumi biara.
He was a perfect gentleman.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa a ɔyɛ pɛ.
Maybe that house isn’t really all that important.	Ebia saa ofie no nyɛ nea ɛho hia saa nyinaa ankasa.
I am making a new plan now.	Meyɛ nhyehyɛe foforo mprempren.
I think you’re right about that.	Misusuw sɛ woayɛ no yiye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Which is not what is happening.	Nea ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so no.
You had a good idea there a few years ago.	Wowɔ adwene pa bi wɔ hɔ mfe kakraa bi a atwam ni.
But that doesn’t feel very much like the truth either.	Nanso ɛno nso nte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware no kɛse.
Price is important.	Bo ho hia.
Or even what he does.	Anaasɛ nea ɔyɛ mpo.
There were many more classes.	Ná adesua ahorow pii wɔ hɔ bio.
And this is no better time than now.	Na eyi nyɛ bere a eye sen mprempren.
However, it is not cheap.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea ne bo yɛ mmerɛw.
I don’t forget that.	M’ani mfi saa asɛm no so.
It will be expensive.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea ne bo yɛ den.
Are you at the game tonight?.	So wowɔ agoru no mu anadwo yi?.
She was beautiful and perfect.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ na na ɔyɛ pɛ.
You get to decide what’s best for you.	Wo nsa ka nea eye ma wo ho gyinae.
That is very likely what happened.	Ɛda adi yiye sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛno na esii.
There was nothing here, nothing there.	Na biribiara nni ha, na biribiara nni hɔ.
There are such very interesting stories.	Nsɛm a ɛte saa a ɛyɛ anigye yiye wɔ hɔ.
There is a new one.	Foforo bi wɔ hɔ.
It will work anyway.	Ɛbɛyɛ adwuma ɔkwan biara so.
It’s huge and very nice.	Ɛyɛ kɛse na ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Mine does the same thing.	Me de nso yɛ saa ara.
I never knew what to say.	Ná minnim nea mɛka da.
The dress made her look great.	Atade no maa ne ho yɛɛ fɛ yiye.
One school night.	Sukuu anadwo bi.
I head to my room.	Mede m’ani kyerɛ me dan mu.
I wanted to feel everything.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mete biribiara nka.
These prices are still very attractive.	Saa nneɛma bo yi da so ara yɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
I know what I have to do.	Minim nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
It’s like that all over again.	Ɛte saa nyinaa bio.
All if it is.	Ne nyinaa sɛ ɛyɛ a.
But it’s not my house.	Nanso ɛnyɛ me fie.
They bring up some things he doesn’t want to hear.	Wɔde nsɛm bi a ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔte ba.
I don’t have to do that.	Ɛho nhia sɛ meyɛ saa.
That’s the end of it.	Ɛno ne awiei no.
I have a child at home.	Mewɔ abofra bi wɔ fie.
They enjoyed the performances immensely.	Wɔn ani gyee agoru ahorow no ho kɛse.
You can’t see the old house.	Worentumi nhu ofie dedaw no.
Go ahead and do well.	Kɔ yiye.
And that touched me.	Na ɛno kaa me.
You don’t have to do anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribi.
I know a man.	Minim ɔbarima bi.
He’s hard, just a little bit.	Ɔyɛ den, kakra kɛkɛ.
And back to the ground.	Na san kɔ fam.
They are connected to each other.	Wɔde wɔn ho abɔ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
Either way, it was a bad thing.	Ɔkwan biara so no, na ɛyɛ ade bɔne.
That seems to work well.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ adwuma yiye.
I can’t believe that.	Me ntumi nnye nni saa.
That was not part of his plan.	Ná ɛno nyɛ ne nhyehyɛe no fã.
That it never mattered.	Sɛ na ɛho nhia da.
We had enough chances to win.	Ná yɛwɔ hokwan ahorow a ɛdɔɔso a yɛde bedi nkonim.
You definitely have something to tell me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wowɔ biribi ka kyerɛ me.
You know the city better than I do.	Wunim kurow no yiye sen me.
In the car.	Wɔ kar no mu.
But there was nothing he could do.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
Money still doesn’t flow like information.	Sika da so ara ntumi nkɔ te sɛ nsɛm.
I feel terrible about it.	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ hu wɔ ho.
He dabbled in literature.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ nhoma ahorow mu.
Let that show.	Ma ɛno nkyerɛ.
The danger was real.	Ná asiane no yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Again, you have the right to this.	Bio nso, wowɔ eyi ho kwan.
Everyone knows how to do this.	Obiara nim sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi.
Only a picture of it remains.	Ne mu mfonini bi pɛ na aka.
You can’t rule with absolute power like you used to.	Worentumi mfa tumi koraa nni tumi sɛnea na ɛte kan no.
We went there by bus.	Yɛde bɔs kɔɔ hɔ.
I can’t do this.	Mintumi nyɛ eyi.
You do the same thing.	Wo nso woyɛ saa.
This may be the case.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ saa.
He was impressive in each of the three wins.	Ɔyɛɛ nwonwa wɔ nkonim abiɛsa no mu biara mu.
One man has a better chance.	Ɔbarima biako wɔ hokwan a eye sen saa.
That was an important moment for me.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere a ɛho hia ma me.
You have too much of your mother in you.	Wowɔ wo maame no pii dodo wɔ wo mu.
A fact of life.	Ade a ɛyɛ nokware.
More trouble than before.	Ɔhaw kɛse sen kan no.
This really shouldn’t be the case.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ saa ankasa.
It’s really something.	Ɛyɛ ade bi ankasa.
But he knew he had to try.	Nanso na onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden.
I liked the dog, though.	Nanso, m’ani gyee ɔkraman no ho.
We would appreciate your help.	Yɛn ani begye mo mmoa ho.
People you barely know.	Nnipa a ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wunnim wɔn.
I really looked forward to those days.	Ná mehwɛ saa nna no kwan ankasa.
He is in him.	Ɔwɔ ne mu.
Your pain is still fresh.	Wo yaw no da so ara yɛ foforo.
What everyone would want.	Nea obiara bɛpɛ.
I think those kids are on to something.	Misusuw sɛ saa mmofra no wɔ biribi so.
It must have been there.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
And even that doesn’t matter.	Na ɛno mpo nyɛ hwee.
We can’t go on like that.	Yɛrentumi nkɔ so nkɔ so saa.
He was completely normal.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔte ase koraa.
Have.	Wɔ.
I couldn’t control the problems.	Na mintumi nni ɔhaw ahorow no so.
Besides, your father can take care of you.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, wo papa betumi ahwɛ wo.
He does well from there.	Ɔyɛ yiye fi hɔ.
I have no control over this power.	Minni tumi biara wɔ saa tumi yi so.
It’s not that complicated.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den saa.
I just had you.	Na mewɔ wo ara kwa.
Everyone makes film on film, film on film.	Obiara yɛ sini wɔ sini so, sini wɔ sini so.
Was it true.	Ná ɛyɛ nokware anaa.
So good for that reason.	Enti papa saa nti.
And a little under your eyes.	Na kakra wɔ w’ani ase.
It is in good condition.	Ɛwɔ tebea pa mu.
Under his authority.	Wɔ ne tumi ase.
What it is, is.	Nea ɛyɛ, ne.
There was no shortage of dramatic expressions.	Na nsɛm a wɔka a ɛyɛ nwonwa nni hɔ a ɛho nhia.
I know you two were very close.	Minim sɛ na mo baanu bɛn wɔn ho yiye.
You should have gone with him.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no kɔ.
What a wonderful man.	Ɔbarima a ɔyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni.
He didn’t know.	Ná onnim.
And we had to do that.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
However, I could be wrong.	Nanso, metumi adi mfomso.
He could get another one.	Ná obetumi anya foforo.
I want to know.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu.
He was taken there after being hit by a car.	Wɔde no kɔɔ hɔ bere a kar bi abɔ no akyi.
However, this seems to have created another problem.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea eyi de ɔhaw foforo aba.
The year started well.	Afe no fii ase yiye.
I think we will do that.	Misusuw sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa.
Get off me! 	Fi me so!
It doesn’t matter, out here.	Ɛho nhia, wɔ ha akyi.
But no one wanted to.	Nanso na obiara mpɛ.
That’s not how he uses language.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɔde kasa di dwuma.
I was right there.	Ná mewɔ hɔ ara.
This child is two years old.	Saa abofra yi adi mfe abien.
But you have to see it from my perspective.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no wɔ m’adwene mu.
There is absolutely no way.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ koraa.
Time, the end of the story.	Bere, asɛm no awiei.
He was just a guy.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima bi kɛkɛ.
People need to know what happened.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo hu nea esii.
You know, it’s never really about the book.	Wunim, ɛnyɛ nhoma no na ɛwɔ asɛm no mu ankasa da.
Check out what he says.	Hwɛ nea ɔka.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na eyi te saa.
There was something else.	Ná biribi foforo wɔ hɔ.
But it was him.	Nanso na ɛyɛ ɔno.
He knows how to do that, so many things.	Onim sɛnea ɔbɛyɛ saa, nneɛma pii saa.
No one said anything, he told himself.	Obiara anka hwee, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho.
Was that really you?	So na ɛno ne wo ankasa?
It’s not as easy as you think.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea wususuw no.
Many children still wear these clothes.	Mmofra pii da so ara hyɛ saa ntade yi.
It was false information.	Ná ɛyɛ atoro nsɛm.
I didn’t want to use it.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mede bedi dwuma.
It’s not something you can plan.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a wubetumi ayɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
He was so fondly described before.	Wɔde anigye kaa ne ho asɛm saa kan.
You were a little weird at our last meeting.	Na wo ho yɛ wo nwonwa kakra wɔ yɛn nhyiam a etwa to no ase.
I really hope you can enjoy it.	Mewɔ anidaso ankasa sɛ wubetumi anya mu anigye.
It’s very hot today.	Ɛyɛ hyew yiye nnɛ.
Which should be enough.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛdɔɔso.
The music was the same.	Ná nnwom no yɛ ade koro.
It’s still never perfect.	Ɛda so ara nyɛ pɛ da.
I had to be quick.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ntɛm.
Certainly in this man.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔ ɔbarima yi mu.
Take plenty of water.	Fa nsu pii.
The next job	Adwuma a edi hɔ .
This again be careful.	Eyi bio hwɛ yiye.
Too soon, too young, too soon.	Ntɛm dodo, abofra dodo, ntɛm dodo.
We do do my thing.	Yɛyɛ yɛ me ade.
I can’t imagine it for anyone.	Mintumi nsusuw ho mma obiara.
He was innocent.	Ná onni mfomso biara.
You don’t have to accept anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wugye biribiara tom.
There is no testing.	Sɔhwɛ biara nni hɔ.
Different types of life.	Nkwa ahorow.
Their studies are riddled with errors.	Mfomso ahorow ahyɛ wɔn adesua ahorow mu ma.
Everyone is equal.	Obiara yɛ pɛ.
Maybe he does.	Ebia ɔyɛ saa.
That was me the worst.	Ɛno ne me a na meyɛ bɔne sen biara.
It will be difficult in the long run.	Ɛbɛyɛ den bere tenten.
You need to do something about it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho biribi.
At least do that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yɛ saa.
He knows the words well.	Onim nsɛm yiye.
He wants you to tell him all about it.	Ɔpɛ sɛ woka ho asɛm nyinaa kyerɛ no.
I am still one of ‘us’.	Meda so ara yɛ ‘yɛn’ mu biako.
That could be the case.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ saa.
That shouldn’t be there.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno ba hɔ.
And this shouldn’t be surprising.	Na ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa.
He smoothed his hat.	Ɔde ne kyɛw no yɛɛ mmerɛw.
Where are they headed?	Ɛhe na wɔde wɔn ani kyerɛ?
That perhaps this time he was gone.	Sɛ ebia saa bere yi de na onni hɔ bio.
The two of them walked down the street.	Wɔn baanu no nantew faa abɔnten no so.
I already have money.	Mewɔ sika dedaw.
At least a little bit.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ kakra.
My father was in it.	Ná me papa wɔ mu.
He is the only one who is real.	Ɔno nkutoo ne obi ankasa.
He wanted to go with her.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne no kɔ.
This is only for the first configuration.	Eyi yɛ nhyehyɛe a edi kan no nkutoo de.
The projects are in progress.	Nnwuma no rekɔ so.
It will be good.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa.
The same day another accident happened.	Da koro no ara na akwanhyia foforo bi sii.
You can find them out there.	Wubetumi anya wɔn wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
Not much needed to be said.	Ná enhia sɛ wɔka nsɛm pii.
There is only something else.	Biribi foforo nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
As you can see .	Sɛnea wubetumi ahu no .
Some things may be similar.	Ebia nneɛma bi te saa ara.
He has done so much for me.	Wayɛ pii ama me.
Stay here if you want.	Sɛ wopɛ a, tra ha.
In the end.	Wɔ awiei no.
You want something better.	Wopɛ biribi a eye sen saa.
The absolute best for me.	Nea eye sen biara koraa ma me.
A good time to give.	Bere pa a wɔde ma.
It’s everything though.	Ɛyɛ biribiara nanso.
Not even in being a dog.	Ɛnyɛ mpo wɔ sɛ́ ɔyɛ ɔkraman no mu.
You might say that there was only one.	Ebia wobɛka sɛ na ɛyɛ biako pɛ.
He’s thinking about his father.	N’adwene wɔ ne papa ho.
Lots of things to offer.	Nneɛma pii a wɔde bɛma.
I feel weird.	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ nwonwa.
And I can’t see it.	Na mintumi nhu.
A very beautiful book.	Nhoma a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I knew he would be fine.	Ná minim sɛ ne ho bɛtɔ no.
There is nothing else.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
Before she could react, he was on top of her.	Ansa na ɔbɛyɛ ho biribi no, na ɔwɔ ne so.
Provide at least one option.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, fa ɔkwan biako ma.
You are not perfect.	Wonyɛ pɛ.
He has the power.	Ɔwɔ tumi.
He wanted you.	Ná ɔpɛ wo.
Trouble or pleasure.	Ɔhaw anaa anigye.
A target is an interest.	Ade a wɔde wɔn ani asi so yɛ ade a wɔn ani gye ho.
Something went completely wrong.	Biribi anyɛ yiye koraa.
I have a few things.	Mewɔ nneɛma kakraa bi.
You are beautiful and we are delighted.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ yɛn anigye.
I’d love to do that.	M’ani begye sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
We are in trouble.	Yɛwɔ ɔhaw mu.
That’s the way it is.	Saa na ɛte saa.
Working with him was a blast.	Ná adwuma a me ne no bɛyɛ no yɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu.
Her hair that was once beautiful and alive.	Ne ti nhwi a bere bi na ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛte ase.
I put him on the floor.	Mede no too fam.
I don’t do that either.	Me nso menyɛ saa.
This is a first of its kind.	Eyi yɛ nea edi kan.
No one knows anything.	Obiara nnim hwee.
There is no picture of him.	Ne mfonini biara nni hɔ.
He liked her immediately.	N’ani gyee ne ho ntɛm ara.
He was the first man on the moon.	Ɔno ne onipa a odi kan wɔ ɔsram so.
This is a dangerous situation.	Eyi yɛ tebea a asiane wom.
Inside, there was a party atmosphere.	Wɔ mu no, na apontow ho tebea bi wɔ hɔ.
It was really happening.	Ná ɛrekɔ so ankasa.
And your dog, too.	Na wo kraman nso.
My jobs would have come.	Anka me nnwuma no bɛba.
It looks pretty perfect.	Ɛte sɛ nea edi mũ yiye.
The people live a simple life.	Nkurɔfo no tra ase wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw so.
I'm so excited!.	M'ani agye yiye!.
And, if so, it would be true.	Na, sɛ ɛte saa a, anka ɛbɛyɛ nokware.
That’s not my intention.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne m’adwene.
This is usually not the case.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ saa na eyi te saa.
However, my eyes fell first.	Nanso, m’ani dii kan hwee ase.
What we have is real.	Nea yɛwɔ no yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
In this system.	Wɔ nhyehyɛe yi mu no.
Which is absolutely horrible.	Nea ɛyɛ hu koraa.
I can’t help but accept it.	Mintumi nyɛ hwee sɛ gye tom.
Perhaps he thought he had.	Ebia ɔno ankasa susuwii sɛ wayɛ saa.
We had all our belongings with us.	Ná yɛn nneɛma nyinaa ka yɛn ho.
I feel like a kid again.	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ abofra bio.
You know what it’s like.	Wunim sɛnea ɛte.
It was just the two of them.	Ná ɛyɛ wɔn baanu no nkutoo.
There is no water.	Nsu biara nni hɔ.
I don’t think anyone would.	Minsusuw sɛ obiara bɛyɛ saa.
Do something about them.	Yɛ wɔn ho biribi.
I don’t think she was ever beautiful.	Minsusuw sɛ na ne ho yɛ fɛ pɛn.
It has power over us.	Ɛwɔ tumi wɔ yɛn so.
Books tell stories.	Nhoma ahorow ka nsɛm.
And this continues throughout the game.	Na eyi kɔ so wɔ agoru no nyinaa mu.
There are three problems here.	Ɔhaw ahorow abiɛsa na ɛwɔ ha.
Only two years left.	Mfe abien pɛ na aka.
But he has to try.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden.
Clearly, this is not yet true.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nnya nyɛ nokware.
Thank you so, so much!.	Meda wo ase saa, pii!.
He kicks in the water.	Ɔbɔ ne nan wɔ nsu no mu.
This seems strange at first.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ nwonwa bere a edi kan no.
He did the study.	Ɔyɛɛ adesua no.
I'm looking at him.	Mehwɛ no.
He just really wants to tell me.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ me ankasa kɛkɛ.
I had a lot to work with.	Ná mewɔ nneɛma pii a me ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
Like you said, it's late.	Sɛnea wokae no, aka akyi.
This complicates manufacturing.	Eyi ma nneɛma a wɔyɛ no yɛ den.
I can’t do this alone.	Me nkutoo ntumi nyɛ eyi.
Not that it mattered what he looked like.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na sɛnea na ɔte no ho hia.
Kids really love using it.	Mmofra ani gye ho ankasa sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma.
No one can see it.	Obiara ntumi nhu.
He didn’t have to play a role.	Ná enhia sɛ odi dwuma bi.
Thank you, guys.	Meda mo ase.
Just don’t go.	Nkɔ kɛkɛ.
I have only done a few tests, but the results have been good.	Sɔhwɛ kakraa bi pɛ na mayɛ, nanso nea afi mu aba no ayɛ papa.
I love all kinds of music.	M’ani gye nnwom ahorow nyinaa ho.
I do know one thing, though.	Nanso, minim ade biako.
I also really enjoyed this book.	M’ani gyee nhoma yi nso ho ankasa.
The problem is, everyone else has got the same idea.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ, obiara a aka no anya adwene koro no ara.
But if he knew.	Nanso sɛ na onim a.
It was terrible, just terrible.	Na ɛyɛ hu, ɛyɛ hu ara kwa.
Everyone wants a good quality.	Obiara pɛ su pa.
Let him do the work.	Ma ɔnyɛ adwuma no.
I just want to be alone, today.	Mepɛ sɛ me nkutoo tra hɔ ara kwa, nnɛ.
His legs are numb.	Ne nan ayɛ mmerɛw.
People are happy again.	Nkurɔfo ani gye bio.
I can find no such help in it.	Mintumi nhu mmoa a ɛte saa biara wɔ mu.
It’s been like that before.	Ɛte saa pɛn.
Let him do it himself.	Ma ɔno ankasa nyɛ.
You’ll be fine.	Wobɛyɛ yiye.
Maybe even bigger.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ kɛse mpo.
Put her in bed now!	Fa no hyɛ mpa so mprempren!
He has survived himself for years.	Ɔno ankasa anya nkwa mfe pii ni.
What is happening here.	Nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha no.
He could be anyone.	Ná obetumi ayɛ obiara.
He is often the first to volunteer.	Mpɛn pii no, ɔno na odi kan tu ne ho ma.
You wouldn’t have known that at the time.	Anka wunnim saa saa bere no.
A car collided with a bus.	Kar bi ne bɔs bi bɔɔ mu.
This dress is still too short for my legs.	Saa atade yi da so ara yɛ tiaa dodo ma me nan.
He forged the letter.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ krataa no atoro.
Maybe he doesn’t.	Ebia ɔnyɛ saa.
Stay in the car.	Tra kar no mu.
The error causes.	Mfomso no de ba.
The same is true	Saa ara nso na
It’s the first day.	Ɛyɛ da a edi kan.
You know, not a bad idea.	Wunim, ɛnyɛ adwene bɔne.
It’s on every house.	Ɛwɔ ofie biara so.
So one of the.	So biako a.
Not this week, though.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ saa dapɛn yi.
Finally, he was free.	Awiei koraa no, na ɔde ne ho.
Our kids are doing well.	Yɛn mma no reyɛ yiye.
There was no one in the car.	Ná obiara nni kar no mu.
I have something in my eyes.	Mewɔ biribi wɔ m’ani so.
You use it when you so desire.	Wode di dwuma bere a wopɛ saa no.
This is a one month period.	Eyi yɛ ɔsram biako bere.
It’s a game.	Ɛyɛ agoru.
But here we were.	Nanso na yɛwɔ ha.
He hardly has any.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ onni bi.
You can’t like yours, but not mine.	Worentumi mpɛ wo de, nanso ɛnyɛ me de.
Their very old clothes.	Wɔn ntade a akyɛ paa.
Someone was at home.	Ná obi wɔ fie.
He plopped down next to me.	Ɔde ne ho bɔɔ fam wɔ me nkyɛn.
It must have been good.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na eye.
A week, maybe.	Dapɛn biako, ebia.
He did his best to spread the word.	Ɔyɛɛ nea obetumi biara de kaa asɛm no ho asɛm kyerɛɛ nkurɔfo.
Not even a month later, the same thing happened.	Ɛnyɛ ɔsram biako mpo akyi no, ade koro no ara sii.
I can’t even believe it.	Me ntumi nnye nni mpo.
He painted a portrait of his father.	Ɔyɛɛ ne papa mfonini.
He had been right, too.	Ná ɔno nso ayɛ nokware.
There are no accidents.	Akwanhyia biara nni hɔ.
The child was a boy, and all is well.	Ná abofra no yɛ abarimaa, na ne nyinaa yɛ yiye.
He was there himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa wɔ hɔ.
He thought the same way.	Ná ɔno nso susuw nneɛma ho saa.
We can do nothing more to help.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ hwee bio mfa mmoa.
And so it is with the snow.	Na saa ara na ɛte.
Nothing follows us for days.	Biribiara nni yɛn akyi nna pii.
Maybe not though.	Ebia ɛnyɛ saa de.
There was not enough paper in the house.	Ná krataa a ɛdɔɔso nni fie hɔ.
I got one of them.	Me nsa kaa biako.
Just not the one below.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ ase ha no ara pɛ.
I have been using it for years.	Mede adi dwuma mfe pii ni.
Someone who is like that.	Obi a ɔte saa.
You are stronger than you know.	Wo ho yɛ den sen sɛnea wunim.
He may have been like that for hours.	Ebia na ɔte saa nnɔnhwerew pii.
He wasn’t doing anything wrong.	Ná ɔnyɛ bɔne biara.
I just did it.	Meyɛɛ no ​​ara kwa.
Not because it’s perfect.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ pɛ nti.
He didn't even have to touch her, just.	Na enhia sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka no mpo, kɛkɛ.
This is crucial in their case.	Eyi ho hia kɛse wɔ wɔn asɛm no mu.
Only a few do that.	Kakraa bi pɛ na wɔyɛ saa.
And no one tells us.	Na obiara nka nkyerɛ yɛn.
Please guide me to keep moving again.	Mesrɛ wo kyerɛ me kwan ma mekɔ so tu kwan bio.
That was completely unnecessary.	Ná ɛno yɛ nea ɛho nhia koraa.
I don't know if there's much else.	Minnim sɛ ebia nneɛma foforo pii wɔ hɔ anaa.
Look behind them, but say nothing.	Hwɛ wɔn akyi, nanso nka asɛm biara.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia.
How nice to be late.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ anigye sɛ wobɛka akyi.
We laid out a plan.	Yɛde nhyehyɛe bi too hɔ.
That seems to be everyone’s favorite.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ne nea obiara ani gye ho.
Just say it.	Kaa no ara kwa.
I had done that.	Ná mayɛ saa.
The system does not seem to be united.	Ɛte sɛ nea nhyehyɛe no nyɛ biako.
I knew everything.	Ná minim biribiara.
But live today.	Nanso tra ase nnɛ.
Most of my money goes to food.	Me sika dodow no ara kɔ aduan mu.
He was in a trailer.	Ná ɔte kar a wɔde fa nnipa mu.
That’s not surprising.	Ɛno nyɛ nwonwa.
That was quite difficult for me.	Ná ɛno yɛ den ma me koraa.
However, there was no help for it.	Nanso, na mmoa biara nni hɔ mma ho.
It seemed like nothing at all to me.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ hwee koraa ma me.
Two jobs are done.	Nnwuma abien a wɔyɛ.
They also offer room service.	Wɔde dan mu adwuma nso ma.
There was nothing else he could have done.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a anka obetumi ayɛ.
The method works incredibly well!	Ɔkwan no yɛ adwuma yiye a ɛyɛ nwonwa!
He has given me everything.	Ɔde biribiara ama me.
No one comes out.	Obiara mfi adi.
No external processing is required.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔde nneɛma a ɛwɔ akyi no yɛ adwuma biara.
This is just as it should be.	Eyi te sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no ara pɛ.
I did something.	Meyɛɛ biribi.
He had done it before and he could do it again.	Ná wayɛ pɛn na na obetumi ayɛ bio.
She practically nodded.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔde ne ti too fam.
Not those pictures here.	Ɛnyɛ saa mfonini ahorow a ɛwɔ ha no.
I don’t know if he will.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɔbɛyɛ saa anaa.
Maybe it matters to them.	Ebia ɛho hia wɔn.
This is a great thing.	Eyi yɛ ade kɛse.
You only get one.	Wo nsa ka biako pɛ.
But he looked like one.	Nanso na ɔte sɛ biako.
Next week, that will be the most important game.	Dapɛn a edi hɔ no, ɛno bɛyɛ agoru a ɛho hia sen biara.
It was such an interesting name for such an interesting girl.	Ná ɛyɛ din a ɛyɛ anigye saa ma abeawa a n’ani gye ho saa.
He had a good attitude.	Ná ɔwɔ adwene pa.
The pictures are stunningly beautiful.	Mfonini ahorow no yɛ fɛ ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
They gave it to him.	Wɔde maa no.
The boy was in shock.	Ná abarimaa no ho dwiriw no.
This car is brand new.	Saa kar yi yɛ foforo koraa.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
But you might do that.	Nanso ebia wobɛyɛ saa.
It was a long time ago.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
Their shoes looked wet.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔn mpaboa no ayɛ nsu.
It has started in front of them.	Afi ase wɔ wɔn anim.
That is very important to me.	Ɛno ho hia me paa.
It is a truly remarkable book.	Ɛyɛ nhoma a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
You do this.	Woyɛ eyi.
Days that are too late.	Nna a ɛda akyiri dodo.
It becomes smarter and stronger as you use it.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea nyansa wom na ayɛ den bere a wode di dwuma no.
If you’re lucky, they’ll go on their own.	Sɛ w’ani gye a, wɔn ankasa bɛkɔ.
You don’t have to tell anyone.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woka kyerɛ obiara.
But this one, by the way.	Nanso eyi de, ɔkwan bi so no.
The truth is not what you want it to be.	Nokware no nyɛ sɛnea wopɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no.
This is my opportunity.	Eyi ne me hokwan.
My wife doesn’t.	Me yere nyɛ saa.
I can’t even begin to tell you how awesome it is.	Mintumi mfi ase mpo nka sɛnea ɛyɛ hu no nkyerɛ wo.
I think it was just me.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
You can see some of the reviews here.	Wubetumi ahu nsɛm a wɔka faa ho no bi wɔ ha.
I tell her she is beautiful.	Meka kyerɛ no sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Keep up the good work.	Kɔ so yɛ adwuma pa no.
This is the kind of thing we design about ourselves.	Eyi ne ade a yɛyɛ ho nhyehyɛe wɔ yɛn ho.
He argued heatedly with his wife.	Ɔne ne yere gyee akyinnye denneennen.
He is a strong man.	Ɔyɛ onipa a ɔyɛ den.
It doesn’t always work.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛyɛ adwuma.
This is an interesting book.	Eyi yɛ nhoma a ɛyɛ anigye.
He just had to be normal.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ obi a ɔte ase ara kwa.
It’s just packed with people.	Nnipa ahyɛ mu ma kɛkɛ.
If he did, he would be working.	Sɛ ɔyɛ saa a, anka ɔreyɛ adwuma.
Not a big deal, for me.	Ɛnyɛ ade kɛse, ma me.
Maybe he was the one.	Ebia na ɔte saa.
It wasn't what he wanted to do.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ.
I'm just telling the truth.	Meka ho nokware ara kwa.
It’s their pleasure.	Ɛyɛ wɔn anigye.
You have done so much for this city already.	Woayɛ pii ama kurow yi dedaw.
Not much time at all, but probably enough.	Ɛnyɛ bere pii koraa, nanso ebia ɛdɔɔso.
This girl never meant to be bad.	Saa abeawa yi ankyerɛ da sɛ ɔbɛyɛ bɔne.
While certainly on each got a little.	Bere a akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔ biara so nyaa kakra.
Nothing ever seems to go beyond that.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara nkɔ akyiri sen saa da.
He had nothing to do with it.	Ná onni ho hwee yɛ.
However, I wanted more.	Nanso, na mepɛ pii.
I am not good at this kind of thing.	Menyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw wɔ saa ade yi mu.
I don’t like him either.	Me nso mempɛ no.
I love the idea.	M’ani gye adwene no ho.
This is a good job.	Saa adwuma a eye yi.
They are complicated.	Wɔyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
I love this book.	M’ani gye nhoma yi ho.
That should have bothered him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno haw no.
And he will always do so.	Na ɔbɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
It is a great power.	Ɛyɛ tumi kɛse.
And there were many of them.	Na wɔn mu pii nso wɔ hɔ.
It was a good idea, but flawed.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene pa, nanso na mfomso wom.
This is not an easy task.	Eyi nyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
It was a very good thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a eye paa.
He has many friends.	Ɔwɔ nnamfo pii.
And there’s a good chance it’s fake.	Na hokwan pa wɔ hɔ sɛ ɛyɛ atoro.
It was not pleasant at all.	Ná ɛnyɛ anigye koraa.
The weekend was a wonderful time.	Ná dapɛn awiei no yɛ bere a ɛyɛ anigye.
His hands were strong.	Ná ne nsa yɛ den.
This is really bad.	Eyi yɛ bɔne ankasa.
The picture didn’t look like me.	Ná mfonini no nte sɛ me.
Go back again and again and again.	San kɔ mpɛn pii ne mpɛn pii.
And it was this.	Na ɛyɛ eyi.
Everyone knew he was an animal lover.	Ná obiara nim sɛ ɔyɛ obi a ɔpɛ mmoa.
He was almost insane.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ne ho ayɛ no den.
I have done a good job.	Mayɛ adwuma pa.
I'm right there.	Mewɔ hɔ ara.
Mistakes occur.	Mfomso ahorow ba.
He never makes a mistake.	Ɔnyɛ mfomso da.
I made a new one.	Meyɛɛ foforo.
This tells me he is definitely in trouble.	Eyi ka kyerɛ me sɛ akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔwɔ ɔhaw mu.
He quickly left the room.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm fii dan no mu.
That was an interesting thing to think about.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
However, this is no longer the case.	Nanso, eyi nte saa bio.
Just talk about it with authority.	Fa tumi ka ho asɛm kɛkɛ.
Both of us.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa.
He wants people to behave.	Ɔpɛ sɛ nkurɔfo yɛ wɔn ade.
They don’t like it.	Wɔn ani nnye ho.
I don’t even have sex.	M’ani nnye nna ho mpo.
I don’t know that that would have been possible.	Minnim sɛ anka ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye.
This is simply not true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware kɛkɛ.
Maybe there is nothing here.	Ebia biribiara nni ha.
I know what you’re going to say.	Minim nea wobɛka.
I thought about it a little bit.	Misusuw ho kakra.
There’s a bit of humanity.	Nnipa su kakra wɔ hɔ.
And it worked for me.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma ma me.
In the meantime right now.	Wɔ saa bere yi mu mprempren ara.
The one sitting there was himself.	Nea na ɔte hɔ ne ɔno ankasa.
No one can get out of there.	Obiara ntumi mfi hɔ.
I should have said that.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka saa asɛm no.
I knew what he would do.	Ná minim nea ɔbɛyɛ.
His gaze was	Ná n’ani a ɔde hwɛ ade no yɛ
This is a wonderful opportunity.	Eyi yɛ hokwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There was little he could do about this.	Ná kakraa bi na obetumi ayɛ wɔ eyi ho.
Everyone really.	Obiara ankasa.
We both understood the rest.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa tee nea aka no ase.
I do them all the time.	Meyɛ wɔn bere nyinaa.
He is in a wonderful mood all day.	Ɔwɔ adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa mu da mũ nyinaa.
Except for me alone.	Gye me nkutoo.
The road is busy today.	Ɔkwan no so yɛ nea adagyew nnim nnɛ.
He could have come here.	Anka obetumi aba ha.
That would be really bad.	Ɛno bɛyɛ bɔne ankasa.
Going to convince him this is a bad idea.	Kɔ ma no gye di sɛ eyi yɛ adwene bɔne.
The numbers were staggering.	Ná dodow no yɛ nwonwa.
Which he certainly will.	Nea akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ.
That was the whole point.	Ná ɛno ne asɛm no nyinaa.
That’s how it should be.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
I am so happy and feel great.	M’ani agye yiye na mete nka sɛ meyɛ kɛse.
This last thing means a lot to me.	Saa ade a etwa to yi kyerɛ ade kɛse ma me.
If it were really easy, everyone would be doing it.	Sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw ampa a, anka obiara reyɛ.
But that didn’t mean his plan wasn’t difficult.	Nanso na ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ ne nhyehyɛe no nyɛ den.
But it was, and it had to be.	Nanso na ɛte saa, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
He wanted what he wanted.	Ná ɔpɛ nea ɔpɛ.
Why should he bother her? 	Dɛn nti na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔhaw no?
But that should happen soon.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ba ntɛm.
He was very dangerous.	Ná ne ho yɛ hu yiye.
The street was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ abɔnten so ma.
Once common enough.	Bere bi na abu so sɛnea ɛsɛ.
It works well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
I don’t know if that’s even possible.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno mpo betumi ayɛ yiye anaa.
You do what you are told.	Woyɛ nea wɔka kyerɛ wo no.
I was alert.	Ná m’ani da hɔ.
The girl thought he was beautiful.	Abeawa no susuwii sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
They all need that.	Wɔn nyinaa hia saa.
That is not true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware.
It was a while ago.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi a atwam ni.
I want to go there too.	Me nso mepɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ.
Keep it well drained.	Ma nsu nkɔ mu yiye.
These tests are expensive but necessary.	Saa sɔhwɛ ahorow yi bo yɛ den nanso ɛho hia.
I slipped to the ground.	Mede me ho too fam.
In this case, however, there was really nothing we could do.	Nanso, wɔ eyi mu no, na biribiara nni hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ ankasa.
This is not a bad or evil thing.	Eyi nyɛ ade bɔne anaa bɔne.
And he was shocked, as well.	Na ne ho dwiriw no, saa ara.
I would think it would hurt more.	Anka misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yaw kɛse.
He has so much power.	Ɔwɔ tumi pii saa.
And that was the case for many.	Na ɛte saa wɔ nnipa pii fam.
I brought him on quickly.	Me de no baa so ntɛmntɛm.
My dad just loves talking.	Me papa ani gye kasa ho ara kwa.
Rely.	Fa wo ho to so.
You just want people to know.	Wopɛ sɛ nkurɔfo hu ara kwa.
I didn't know where to go now.	Ná minnim baabi a mɛkɔ mprempren.
This car looks very expensive.	Saa kar yi hwɛ sɛ ne bo yɛ den yiye.
That doesn’t mean the dog knows me.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ ɔkraman no nim me.
Maybe this goes too far.	Ebia eyi kɔ akyiri dodo.
That’s why only the first one works.	Ɛno nti na nea edi kan no nkutoo na ɛyɛ adwuma no.
I get it too.	Me nso me nsa ka.
The long walk was invigorating.	Ná nantew tenten no hyɛɛ den.
These surprises bring the story to life.	Saa nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa yi ma asɛm no ba nkwa mu.
I have some of his books.	Mewɔ ne nhoma ahorow no bi.
You know my wife.	Wunim me yere.
Many people.	Nnipa pii.
This morning, however, is a whole different story.	Nanso, anɔpa yi yɛ asɛm foforo koraa.
He pointed to the door.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ ɔpon no so.
I could have gone.	Ná metumi akɔ.
You can see it in the picture below.	Wubetumi ahu no wɔ mfonini a ɛwɔ ase ha no mu.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
It all ended for him.	Ne nyinaa baa awiei maa no.
These people don’t exist at all.	Saa nkurɔfo yi nni hɔ koraa.
I really enjoy the work.	M’ani gye adwuma no ho ankasa.
Anyway, it was a lot of fun.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
Well done, you.	Woayɛ no yiye, wo.
He looked at me with all his problems.	Ɔde ne haw nyinaa hwɛɛ me.
It was important in his plans.	Ná ɛho hia wɔ ne nhyehyɛe ahorow mu.
The dog eats the dog, so they say.	Ɔkraman di kraman, enti wɔka.
They argued for hours.	Wɔde nnɔnhwerew pii gyee akyinnye.
But this is happening.	Nanso eyi rekɔ so.
Very much like me.	Te sɛ me yiye.
There is much today about this.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ nnɛ wɔ eyi ho.
Many people attended that meeting.	Nnipa pii baa saa nhyiam no ase.
This article is one of the last.	Saa asɛm yi yɛ nea etwa to no mu biako.
I think it’s a smart decision.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ gyinae a nyansa wom.
It’s terrible, it’s terrible.	Ɛyɛ hu, ɛyɛ hu.
Big mistake on my part.	Mfomso kɛse wɔ me fam.
But such thinking has caused problems.	Nanso adwene a ɛte saa de ɔhaw aba.
It works, and it works well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma, na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
And in this case, not really.	Na wɔ eyi mu no, ɛnte saa ankasa.
What to do next.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ akyi.
You’re not me.	Wonyɛ me.
I still have my days.	Meda so ara wɔ me nna.
Please can someone help me as soon as possible.	Mesrɛ sɛ obi betumi aboa me ntɛm ara sɛnea obetumi.
But it doesn’t have to be.	Nanso enhia sɛ ɛte saa.
This can be dangerous.	Eyi betumi ayɛ nea asiane wom.
They were both only children.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ mmofra nkutoo.
He would do that.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ saa.
That movie is not good at all.	Saa sini no nyɛ papa koraa.
But, you know, it’s okay.	Nanso, wunim, ɛnyɛ hwee.
I pointed to him.	Mede me nsa kyerɛɛ no ​​so.
You seem like a bright kid.	Ɛte sɛ nea woyɛ abofra a ne ho yɛ hyew.
It’s a very complicated thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ den yiye.
As if it was never enough.	Te sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso da.
How beautiful she is.	Hwɛ sɛnea ne ho yɛ fɛ.
People recognized him and stepped aside.	Nkurɔfo huu no na wɔde wɔn ho too nkyɛn.
Nothing was what it seemed.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte no.
He was the worst.	Ná ɔno ne obi a ɔyɛ bɔne sen biara.
He was once there.	Bere bi na ɔwɔ hɔ.
She petted her dog excitedly.	Ɔde anigye bɔɔ ne kraman no.
However, he was happy.	Nanso, na anigye ka ne ho.
It’s not anything.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara.
He put the book on the table.	Ɔde nhoma no too pon no so.
I had to tell him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no.
The other man nodded.	Ɔbarima foforo no de ne ti too fam.
It was our father.	Ná ɛyɛ yɛn papa.
Last month, but whatever.	Ɔsram a etwaam no, nanso nea ɛte biara.
So this food item must be important.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ aduan ade yi ho hia.
It’s all of those things, but so much more.	Ɛyɛ saa nneɛma no nyinaa, nanso pii sen saa.
The new system overcomes the problems with the old method.	Nhyehyɛe foforo no di ɔhaw ahorow a ɛwɔ ɔkwan dedaw no so no so.
You can say what you say, but you do what you do.	Wubetumi aka nea woka, nanso woyɛ nea woyɛ.
So many new people.	Enti nnipa foforo pii.
It’s just beautiful for tonight.	Ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa ma anadwo yi.
In just one case.	Wɔ asɛm biako pɛ mu.
I want to believe that my mother is not like that.	Mepɛ sɛ migye di sɛ me maame nte saa.
He did bad things, and terrible things happened.	Ɔyɛɛ nneɛma bɔne, na nneɛma a ɛyɛ hu sii.
However, this view is flawed.	Nanso, saa adwene yi yɛ mfomso.
His departure left a huge gap for me.	Ne kɔ no maa ɔkwan kɛse baa me so.
But they are good.	Nanso wɔyɛ papa.
My profile is given below.	Wɔde me ho nsɛm ama wɔ ase ha.
Everyone agrees on that.	Obiara gye tom wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
However, here we are.	Nanso, ha na yɛwɔ.
You know this is wrong.	Wunim sɛ eyi yɛ mfomso.
He was not an independent thinker.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a ɔde ne ho susuw nneɛma ho.
I'm really looking forward to doing it all.	Mehwɛ kwan ankasa sɛ mɛyɛ ne nyinaa.
He controls everything from here on out.	Ɔno na odi biribiara so fi ha rekɔ.
Verify the phone is running smoothly.	Hwɛ sɛnea telefon no rekɔ yiye.
Maybe even the scary ones.	Ebia nea ɛyɛ hu mpo.
He headed for the door.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ɔpon no ano.
The car was in excellent condition.	Ná kar no wɔ tebea pa mu.
John is my bike.	John yɛ me sakre.
Cold for everything but him.	Awɔw ma biribiara gye ɔno nkutoo.
This is more interesting than it sounds.	Eyi yɛ anigye sen sɛnea ɛte.
Never enough information.	Nsɛm a ɛdɔɔso da.
What it really is.	Nea ɛyɛ ankasa no.
There will be a very important paper.	Krataa a ɛho hia kɛse bɛba hɔ.
I feel like I’m happy.	Mete nka sɛ m’ani agye.
It was a terrible time for me.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ hu ma me.
Nothing is alive.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte ase.
He’s just a happy guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔwɔ anigye ara kwa.
But no chance of that happening for me.	Nanso hokwan biara nni hɔ sɛ ɛno bɛba ama me.
It’s very, very bad.	Ɛyɛ bɔne paa, paa.
There was so much he wanted to say.	Na pii wɔ hɔ a na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka.
He placed the leather on the table.	Ɔde aboa nhoma no too pon no so.
It is the way of our people.	Ɛyɛ yɛn nkurɔfo kwan.
Look at it any way you want.	Hwɛ no wɔ ɔkwan biara a wopɛ so.
The details were vague.	Ná nsɛm no mu nna hɔ.
That’s what you do best.	Ɛno ne nea woyɛ no yiye.
I always have one.	Mewɔ bi bere nyinaa.
But that’s beside the point.	Nanso ɛno wɔ asɛm no nkyɛn.
No one had one.	Ná obiara nni bi.
I was really shocked.	Me ho dwiriw me ankasa.
I shouldn’t say that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meka saa.
I owe you a lot.	Mede wo ka kɛse.
That didn’t exist before.	Ná ɛno nni hɔ kan.
So, what have you been up to, lately?	Enti, dɛn na woayɛ, nnansa yi?
He is a very interesting character.	Ɔyɛ obi a n’ani gye ho kɛse.
I go to work every day.	Mekɔ adwuma da biara.
You want that story.	Wopɛ saa asɛm no.
One of your dad’s favorites as a kid.	Nea wo papa ani gye ho kɛse bere a na ɔyɛ abofra no mu biako.
I felt much better after that.	Me ho tɔɔ me kɛse wɔ ɛno akyi.
It seemed that	Ná ɛte sɛ nea .
The meeting lasted all afternoon.	Nhyiam no kɔɔ so awia mũ no nyinaa.
And you’re interested in it.	Na w’ani gye ho.
This can take some time.	Eyi betumi agye bere kakra.
By then, it was over.	Saa bere no, na aba awiei.
This is still a ground chance.	Eyi da so ara yɛ hokwan a ɛwɔ fam.
We were beautiful.	Ná yɛn ho yɛ fɛ.
But it was true.	Nanso na ɛyɛ nokware.
It was a perfect opportunity.	Ná ɛyɛ hokwan a edi mũ.
I could hit hard.	Ná metumi abɔ denneennen.
What a terrible thing.	Nea ɛyɛ hu.
That’s what he’s doing here.	Ɛno ne nea ɔreyɛ wɔ ha.
So you know, keep going.	Enti wunim, kɔ so kɔ so.
In other words, surprise the system.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ma nhyehyɛe no ho dwiriw no.
Do what he says.	Yɛ nea ɔka no.
This song is not just a song.	Saa dwom yi nyɛ dwom ara kwa.
He should have done more.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nneɛma pii.
That’s the bad reason.	Ɛno ne ade bɔne a enti a ɛte saa.
That doesn’t help either.	Ɛno nso mmoa.
There was a bitter cold this morning.	Awɔw a ano yɛ den bi sii anɔpa yi.
There is a lot of work ahead.	Adwuma pii wɔ yɛn anim.
Most of their works are musical.	Wɔn nnwuma dodow no ara yɛ nnwom.
He wrapped his arms around me.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ me mu.
Hours and hours.	Nnɔnhwerew ne nnɔnhwerew pii.
This was the best time of the year.	Ná eyi ne bere a eye sen biara wɔ afe no mu.
Talk to me, like people.	Kasa kyerɛ me, te sɛ nnipa.
Describe one of the characters.	Ka nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no mu biako ho asɛm.
I didn’t want to hear it again.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete bio.
I can give your wife a shot, though.	Metumi ama wo yere no tuo, nanso.
He had no time for her.	Ná onni bere mma no.
There was nothing wrong with it.	Na mfomso biara nni ho.
I barely have any hands on it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ minni nsa biara wɔ so.
And if it’s just.	Na sɛ ɛyɛ kɛkɛ a.
Not even my mother.	Ɛnyɛ me maame mpo.
We really had our hands full without this one.	Na yɛn nsa ayɛ ma ampa a eyi nka ho.
The informal work must be done on a daily basis.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma a ɛnyɛ ɔkwan biara so no da biara da.
That would be a.	Ɛno bɛyɛ a.
But not all people know that.	Nanso nnipa no nyinaa nnim saa.
You see the game in a whole new light.	Wuhu agoru no wɔ ɔkwan foforo koraa so.
Must be in good condition and function flawlessly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ tebea pa mu na ɛyɛ adwuma a mfomso biara nni ho.
It just doesn’t sound good.	Ɛnte sɛ nea ɛyɛ papa kɛkɛ.
It’s much more than that.	Ɛyɛ pii sen saa.
He was never one to say things.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a ɔka nneɛma ho da.
There must have been at least one other person.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na onipa foforo biako wɔ hɔ.
We were doing the same thing.	Ná yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa.
This needs to end.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi ba awiei.
I want more.	Mepɛ pii.
There was the issue of water.	Ná nsu ho asɛm no wɔ hɔ.
He knew them well.	Ná onim wɔn yiye.
I am the one who makes these statements.	Me na meyɛ saa nsɛm yi.
He could bring these people to the screen.	Ná obetumi de saa nkurɔfo yi aba sini no so.
Remember this well.	Kae asɛm yi yiye.
I have to give it to my mom.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede ma me maame.
He does, of course.	Ɔyɛ, ampa.
He knows what he’s doing.	Onim nea ɔreyɛ.
I would have loved it.	Anka m’ani begye ho.
My mother did what she wanted.	Me maame yɛɛ nea ɔpɛ.
I know this, you know this.	Minim eyi, mo nim eyi.
He!' 	Ɔno!'
They were united.	Ná wɔyɛ biako.
I wish it was only three days instead of two.	Me yam a anka ɛyɛ nnansa pɛ sen sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nna abien.
It was an old face.	Ná ɛyɛ anim dedaw bi.
I would have done the same.	Anka me nso mɛyɛ saa.
This was all a terrible mistake.	Ná eyi nyinaa yɛ mfomso a ɛyɛ hu.
I could use a party.	Ná metumi de apontow bi adi dwuma.
Big picture, remember.	Mfonini kɛse, kae.
She wanted him back then too.	Ná ɔno nso pɛ no saa bere no.
He was very excited.	Ná n’ani agye kɛse.
He glanced at the group.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ kuw no.
I told him it was a game.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛyɛ agoru.
That’s the big thing.	Ɛno ne ade kɛse no.
Maybe it was as simple as that.	Ebia na ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ ɛno.
It’s not our business.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn asɛm.
Children needed more.	Na mmofra hia pii.
He put down a book.	Ɔde nhoma bi too fam.
He would go to his room.	Ná ɔbɛkɔ ne dan mu.
He’s the same thing.	Ɔno nso te saa ara.
I was a child at the time.	Saa bere no na meyɛ abofra.
Do not let the water flow.	Mma nsu no nkɔ.
It’s just dinner.	Ɛyɛ anwummere aduan ara kwa.
Everything was great.	Biribiara a ɛrekɔ so no yɛɛ kɛse.
This doesn’t mean much to me.	Eyi nkyerɛ pii mma me.
I’m excited about that.	M’ani agye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Another person.	Onipa foforo.
It is a test with error condition.	Ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ a mfomso tebea.
Your test failed.	Wo sɔhwɛ no antumi anyɛ yiye.
I think you can help me, you can even find him.	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi aboa me, wubetumi mpo ahu no.
But that doesn’t work either.	Nanso ɛno nso nyɛ adwuma.
Maybe it’s a bug.	Ebia ɛyɛ bɔne bi.
It was up to me to take care of him.	Ná ɛyɛ me na ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ no yiye.
However, this is not always true.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na eyi yɛ nokware ankasa.
I don’t even know you.	Minnim wo mpo.
But it doesn’t work that way.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma saa.
There is no part of the language!	Kasa no fã nni hɔ!
I'm totally on it.	Mewɔ so koraa.
However, it was not his way.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ ne kwan no.
They should be happy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn ani gye.
I’m enjoying this book.	M’ani agye nhoma yi ho.
Beautiful presentation.	Nsɛm a wɔka kyerɛ a ɛyɛ fɛ.
He liked her then.	Ná n’ani gye ne ho saa bere no.
But it is so.	Nanso ɛte saa.
The animals are in danger.	Mmoa no wɔ asiane mu.
As if he had no control over himself.	Te sɛ nea onni ne ho so tumi biara.
If you like it, great.	Sɛ w’ani gye ho a, ɛyɛ kɛse.
I take time every day to do it.	Migye bere da biara de yɛ.
He uses it for at least two reasons.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, nneɛma abien nti na ɔde di dwuma.
Its length is about	Ne tenten bɛyɛ .
It was in my eyes.	Ná ɛwɔ m’ani so.
You could see what was going on.	Ná wubetumi ahu nea ɛrekɔ so.
Everything runs and works normally.	Biribiara tu mmirika na ɛyɛ adwuma sɛnea ɛte no.
It is still true.	Ɛda so ara yɛ nokware.
He hardly knew the man.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na onnim ɔbarima no.
This is not entirely true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
There are positives.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ papa wɔ hɔ.
That includes me.	Ɛno ka me ho.
Go back to the beginning.	San kɔ fi ase.
This should not have worked.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma.
I know that’s true.	Minim sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
This is the situation.	Eyi ne tebea no.
However, he wasn’t happy.	Nanso, na n’ani nnye.
One doesn’t really need that.	Obi nhia saa ankasa.
Something like that.	Biribi a ɛte saa.
Not down here, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ ha ase, ɔkwan biara so.
This is a really big deal.	Eyi yɛ ade kɛse ankasa.
None of them give a car deal.	Wɔn mu biara mfa kar ho asɛm biara mma.
Do these words affect you?	Saa nsɛm yi so wo?
Their plan didn’t work.	Wɔn nhyehyɛe no ankɔ yiye.
This often takes away the power.	Eyi taa gye tumi no fi hɔ.
I am an ordinary man.	Meyɛ ɔbarima kwa.
It’s a really nice city.	Ɛyɛ kurow a ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
No one told me how to do it.	Obiara ankyerɛ me sɛnea mɛyɛ.
But there is no dog.	Nanso ɔkraman biara nni hɔ.
I loved this moment.	M’ani gyee saa bere yi ho.
It is not perfect.	Ɛnyɛ nea edi mũ.
I admire your work so much.	M’ani gye wo adwuma no ho kɛse.
He knew where he was.	Ná onim baabi a ɔwɔ.
Simply, like any animal.	Nea ɛte ara ne sɛ, te sɛ aboa biara.
I heard about the stories.	Metee nsɛm no ho asɛm.
I had two of them.	Ná mewɔ wɔn mu abien.
I didn’t want to be there anymore.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ bio.
It was only a test for humans.	Ná ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ ma nnipa nkutoo.
As fast as possible now.	Ntɛmntɛm sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye mprempren.
He did it well.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​yiye.
But it’s definitely impressive.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It is easy to use.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
His words gave many hope.	Ne nsɛm no maa nnipa pii nyaa anidaso.
It just seemed like it had to.	Na ɛte sɛ nea na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa ara kwa.
If you have a fresh copy, much better.	Sɛ wowɔ bi a ɛyɛ foforo a, eye kɛse.
Take my money.	Fa me sika.
It seems to sleep very long, too.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛda tenten paa, nso.
The scenery is breathtaking.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Let no one take it.	Mma obiara mfa.
Who put it there?	Hena na ɔde too hɔ?
The girl looked at him.	Abeawa no hwɛɛ no.
Now more than ever.	Mprempren sen bere biara.
A lot of time had passed.	Ná bere pii atwam.
There was no opinion on that.	Ná adwene biara nni hɔ wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
He's a picky eater.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔpɛ sɛ odi aduan.
There was just nothing.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ ara kwa.
Whatever it is, he does.	Nea ɛyɛ biara no, ɔyɛ.
He’s a good boy, but he loves to talk, too.	Ɔyɛ abarimaa pa, nanso n’ani gye kasa ho, nso.
That’s why, it still isn’t.	Ɛno nti, ɛda so ara nyɛ saa.
The best of best friends.	Nnamfo pa a wɔyɛ papa sen biara.
But we should have given it.	Nanso anka ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde ma.
How many of these things are there?	Saa nneɛma yi mu ahe na ɛwɔ hɔ?
Something else.	Biribi foforo.
I will tell you what we will do.	Meka nea yɛbɛyɛ akyerɛ mo.
They are both beautiful.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa ho yɛ fɛ.
That’s how you can get into it.	Saa na wubetumi akɔ mu.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
But it doesn’t work for everyone.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma mma obiara.
How long have you known him?	Bere tenten ahe na wunim no?
That would be exciting for me.	Ɛno bɛyɛ anigye ama me.
I thought this might be them.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia eyi ne wɔn.
But that’s part of the fun of it.	Nanso ɛno yɛ anigye a ɛwɔ mu no fã.
I am still part of the problem.	Meda so ara ka ɔhaw no ho.
I made this house for you.	Meyɛɛ ofie yi maa wo.
He had no idea what his feet were doing.	Ná onni nea ne nan reyɛ ho adwene biara.
Just make it a game.	Ma ɛnyɛ agoru kɛkɛ.
Their feet have nothing to do with it.	Wɔn nan ne ho nni hwee yɛ.
We are the only ones.	Yɛn nkutoo.
I have to provide information.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede nsɛm ma.
Fortunately, this is not the case here.	Nea eye ne sɛ, eyi nte saa wɔ ha.
But no one was saying anything.	Nanso na obiara nka hwee.
This city was not one.	Ná kurow yi nyɛ biako.
Other than that, the picture looks great.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, mfonini no hwɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He controls what he can.	Ɔno na odi nea obetumi so.
You can’t do it at home.	Wo ntumi nyɛ no wɔ fie.
And the game is the thing.	Na agoru no ne ade no.
There may be another reason.	Ebia biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ a enti a ɛte saa.
It works well for them.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ma wɔn.
What car does he drive?	Kar bɛn na ɔka?
It was the most terrible morning.	Ná ɛyɛ anɔpa a ɛyɛ hu sen biara.
It’s this time.	Ɛyɛ saa bere yi.
No food, no water, no sleep.	Aduan biara nni hɔ, nsu biara nni hɔ, nna biara nni hɔ.
I didn’t have to do that.	Ná enhia sɛ meyɛ saa.
It’s going to go further.	Ɛrekɔ akyiri.
Come out with your hands up.	Fi adi a wo nsa so.
Can you bring him here?	So wubetumi de no aba ha?
Her legs were bare.	Ná ne nan ho da hɔ.
It had an interesting language.	Ná ɛwɔ kasa bi a ɛyɛ anigye.
But the problem is worse than ever.	Nanso ɔhaw no mu ayɛ den sen bere biara.
That’s easy.	Ɛno yɛ mmerɛw.
As far as I know, that never happened.	Sɛnea minim no, ɛno amma da.
Not here, obviously.	Ɛnyɛ ha, ɛda adi sɛ.
Everyone has a terrible time.	Obiara wɔ bere a ɛyɛ hu.
The team has done very well since then.	Kuw no ayɛ yiye paa fi saa bere no.
Animals and humans are equal.	Mmoa ne nnipa yɛ pɛ.
Take this letter with you.	Fa krataa yi kɔ.
Thank you again.	Meda mo ase bio.
I went in with him.	Me ne no kɔɔ mu.
I just don’t know what to do.	Minnim nea mɛyɛ kɛkɛ.
This is what you are doing.	Eyi na woreyɛ.
Not my group.	Ɛnyɛ me kuw no.
I thought he was doing the whole thing.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔno na ɔreyɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
Everyone knows me there.	Obiara nim me wɔ hɔ.
That made me interested.	Ɛno maa m’ani gyee ho.
I never thought about that.	Minsusuw saa asɛm no ho da.
He is not perfect in any way.	Ɔnyɛ pɛ ɔkwan biara so.
It’s all still so fresh.	Ne nyinaa da so ara yɛ foforo saa.
It’s all done that.	Ne nyinaa ayɛ saa.
I received this, this morning.	Me nsa kaa eyi, anɔpa yi.
It’s not the job of the police.	Ɛnyɛ polisifo adwuma.
It’s just a little bit easier.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw kakra kɛkɛ.
Long enough for both of us.	Bere tenten a ɛdɔɔso ma yɛn baanu nyinaa.
Under threat of life.	Wɔ nkwa ho asiane ase.
This is their first year.	Eyi ne wɔn afe a edi kan.
I put it in and it is a big help.	Mede hyɛɛ mu na ɛyɛ mmoa kɛse.
It’s really that.	Ɛte saa ankasa.
He ran to the window.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ mfɛnsere no mu.
It doesn’t happen anymore.	Ɛnyɛ bio.
Definitely a lot of girl power.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ abeawa tumi pii.
He could forget about it.	Ná ne werɛ betumi afi ho asɛm.
He looks like he's doing something.	Ɔte sɛ nea ɔreyɛ biribi.
It’s always the end of the day.	Ɛyɛ da no awiei bere nyinaa.
Who knew, maybe he did.	Hena na na onim, ebia na onim.
Even so, it is not.	Ɛno mpo no, ɛnte saa.
It’s a house.	Ɛyɛ fie.
His eyes flicked to hers and down again.	N’ani kyerɛɛ ne de no so na ɔde kɔɔ fam bio.
No one can beat our quality car at our price.	Obiara ntumi nni yɛn kar a ɛyɛ papa no so nkonim wɔ yɛn bo no so.
In that, too.	Wɔ ɛno mu no, nso.
But none of them were human.	Nanso na wɔn mu biara nyɛ onipa.
Which is harder than it looks.	Nea ɛyɛ den sen sɛnea ɛte no.
Immediately, it was obvious that something strange was happening.	Ntɛm ara, na ɛda adi sɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa rekɔ so.
He didn't know what he wanted to do.	Ná onnim nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
Everyone really wants a job.	Obiara pɛ adwuma ankasa.
Maybe it would have been.	Ebia anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Not just one other person, either.	Ɛnyɛ onipa foforo biako pɛ, nso.
It wasn’t the first time.	Ná ɛnyɛ bere a edi kan koraa.
His favorite food, though, is people.	Nanso, aduan a n’ani gye ho paa ne nnipa.
I didn't want to know if he could.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu sɛ ebia obetumi ayɛ saa anaa.
They drive in many cars every day.	Wɔka kar wɔ kar pii mu da biara.
People need to start thinking about it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo fi ase susuw ho.
It is fine for most users.	Ɛyɛ papa ma wɔn a wɔde di dwuma dodow no ara.
The controls are awesome.	Nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma no yɛ hu.
It wasn't supposed to be a game in this way.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ agoru wɔ saa kwan yi so.
Anyone who knows anything knows that.	Obiara a onim biribi nim saa.
Except for this one.	Gye sɛ eyi nkutoo.
You know you have a day.	Wunim sɛ wowɔ da.
I have to make a new one.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ foforo.
This room will be our home.	Saa dan yi bɛyɛ yɛn fie.
That meant a lot.	Ná ɛno kyerɛ pii.
No doubt he knew about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na onim ho asɛm.
It’s absolutely the case.	Ɛte saa koraa.
But it should be a good convenience for them.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ade pa a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ma wɔn.
You know, almost as simple as that.	Wunim, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ saa.
However, they had to do so.	Nanso, na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
The problem is over.	Ɔhaw no aba awiei.
So just be great.	Enti yɛ kɛse ara kwa.
The better, the greater you are.	Dodow a eye no, dodow no ara na woyɛ kɛse.
My mother didn’t like us.	Ná me maame mpɛ yɛn.
That was a whole other story.	Ná ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo koraa.
Can anyone help me with this?.	Obi betumi aboa me wɔ eyi ho?.
People said he was ahead of his time.	Nkurɔfo kae sɛ odi ne bere anim.
What it is.	Nea ɛyɛ.
The dog is much faster.	Ɔkraman no tu mmirika sen saa koraa.
All for the sake of human life.	Ne nyinaa de gye onipa nkwa.
He uses whatever resources he has.	Ɔde nneɛma biara a ɔwɔ di dwuma.
For you, this book is a must.	Wo fam no, nhoma yi yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
This statement will always be false.	Saa asɛm yi bɛyɛ atoro bere nyinaa.
It is the way of his people.	Ɛyɛ ne nkurɔfo kwan.
He had a gun.	Ná ɔwɔ tuo bi.
However, it does it in such a beautiful way.	Nanso, ɛyɛ no wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ fɛ saa so.
Nothing else is included.	Biribi foforo biara nka ho.
Just a guy.	Ɔbarima bi kɛkɛ.
This is nothing.	Eyi nyɛ hwee.
I don’t like it very much.	M’ani nnye ho kɛse.
Which was perfectly fine for me.	Nea na eye koraa ma me.
Innovation and quality are almost non-existent.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nneɛma foforo ne nea ɛyɛ papa nni hɔ.
Or evening wear, for that matter.	Anaasɛ anwummere ntade, ɛno nti.
It’s one of the best right now.	Ɛyɛ biako a eye sen biara mprempren.
It wasn’t all work.	Ná ɛnyɛ adwuma nyinaa na ɛyɛ.
Anyone and everyone, anything and everything.	Obiara ne obiara ho, biribiara ne biribiara ho.
But something interesting happened as the season wore on.	Nanso biribi a ɛyɛ anigye sii bere a bere no kɔɔ so no.
It doesn’t have to be anything else.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ biribi foforo biara.
Did he think he could get out of it like that.	So na osusuw sɛ obetumi afi mu saa.
It had gone the other way.	Ná akɔ ɔkwan foforo no so.
And eat it he does.	Na di no ɔyɛ.
something strange happened.	biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii.
But it was a lot of fun for me.	Nanso na ɛyɛ me anigye kɛse.
even so.	saa mpo.
Something absolutely terrible happened.	Biribi a ɛyɛ hu sii koraa.
A city without music?	Kurow a nnwom nnim?
He was what he seemed to be.	Ná ɔyɛ nea na ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ.
Much work needed to be done here.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma pii wɔ ha.
The length of this skirt is quite long.	Saa atade yi tenten yɛ tenten yiye.
And the kids, too.	Na mmofra no nso.
You know there is still another problem.	Wunim sɛ ɔhaw foforo da so ara wɔ hɔ.
This is very difficult for me.	Eyi yɛ den ma me yiye.
That may sound true, but it is not.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛno yɛ nokware, nanso ɛnte saa.
But it was terrible.	Nanso na ɛyɛ hu.
It was a great one.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse.
The road to the story.	Ɔkwan a ɛda asɛm no so.
This was a happy day.	Ná eyi yɛ anigye da.
Even if it was a mistake.	Sɛ na ɛyɛ mfomso bi mpo a.
I didn’t have any money.	Ná minni sika biara.
There seemed to be no time.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea bere nni hɔ.
I feel like everyone else.	Mete nka te sɛ obiara.
None of us are left.	Yɛn mu biara nni hɔ a aka.
This is a great group.	Eyi yɛ kuw kɛse bi.
Maybe things are better now.	Ebia nneɛma ayɛ yiye mprempren.
How does that work?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na ɛno yɛ adwuma?
He was sentenced to three years in prison.	Wɔde no too afiase mfe abiɛsa.
The moment was mine.	Ná bere no yɛ me de.
The money bought him time, and space.	Sika no tɔɔ no bere, ne baabi a ɔde bɛyɛ adwuma.
My legs hurt.	Me nan yɛɛ me yaw.
I am the only one here.	Me nkutoo na mewɔ ha.
But this time, this is not bad.	Nanso saa bere yi de, eyi nyɛ bɔne.
I can go on and on.	Metumi akɔ so akɔ so ayɛ saa.
And this can be painful.	Na eyi betumi ayɛ yaw.
Good can come from evil.	Papa betumi afi bɔne mu aba.
That is very clear.	Ɛno mu da hɔ yiye.
However, he may be a touch too quick here.	Nanso, ebia ɔbɛyɛ obi a ɔde ne nsa ka no ntɛmntɛm dodo wɔ ha.
Like, you always did.	Te sɛ, na woyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
You are my father.	Wo ne me papa.
These results show just how dangerous these things are.	Nea afi mu aba yi kyerɛ sɛnea nneɛma yi yɛ hu ara kwa.
I can really do it.	Metumi ankasa.
I don't really know why, though.	Nanso, minnim nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa.
We have the edge of things.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma ano.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛnyɛ hwee.
Usually, your points are great.	Mpɛn pii no, wo nsɛm no yɛ kɛse.
This approach went further than the last.	Saa kwan yi kɔɔ akyiri sen nea etwa to no.
And his legs, too.	Na ne nan nso.
Mom told me not to.	Maame ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ menyɛ saa.
He had my mother.	Ná ɔwɔ me maame.
You have no idea why you are here.	Wunnim nea enti a wowɔ ha no ho hwee.
But only a little bit.	Nanso kakra bi pɛ.
Offer the book now.	Fa nhoma no ma no mprempren.
He just didn’t like it.	Ná n’ani nnye ho ara kwa.
He leaned closer to me.	Ɔde ne ho too mu bɛn me.
Not just people like me.	Ɛnyɛ nnipa te sɛ me nkutoo.
That went on for so many years.	Ɛno kɔɔ so mfe pii saa.
As well as it should.	Sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no yiye no.
So, very happy for him and everyone there.	Enti, anigye kɛse ma ɔne obiara a ɔwɔ hɔ.
He stuck his head in the front door.	Ɔde ne ti hwee ase wɔ anim pon no mu.
There were no police, no one.	Ná polisifo nni hɔ, na obiara nni hɔ.
I don’t get any.	Me nnya bi.
If that’s what you want.	Sɛ ɛno ne nea wopɛ a.
That’s the first impression.	Ɛno ne adwene a edi kan no.
And my son, too.	Na me ba no nso.
It’s up to me to have the easy job.	Ɛyɛ me na mewɔ adwuma a ɛnyɛ den no.
I had fun with it last night.	Mede gyee m’ani anadwo a etwaam no.
Give us that opportunity.	Ma yɛn saa hokwan no.
I wonder what it was like.	Misusuw sɛnea na ɛte saa no ho.
He had to be whole.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ mũ.
Something happened, something else.	Biribi sii, biribi foforo.
And for another reason, too.	Na biribi foforo nti, nso.
Might as well have him here.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ ɔwɔ ha nso.
This game is definitely for you.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ saa agoru yi yɛ ma wo.
It never needed another name.	Ná enhia din foforo biara da.
There was someone at the door.	Ná obi wɔ ɔpon no ano.
It’s all after the problem.	Ne nyinaa yɛ ɔhaw no akyi.
They are his team.	Wɔyɛ ne kuw no.
And you have to do this the first time.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi nea edi kan.
I had no interest in him.	Ná minni ne ho anigye biara.
The reasons for our conclusion are twofold.	Nea enti a yɛde asɛm no baa awiei no yɛ abien.
Make sure that	Hwɛ hu sɛ
Walk out of the house if necessary.	Sɛ ɛho hia a, nantew fi fie hɔ.
I have a right to it.	Mewɔ hokwan ma no.
Meetings are held in the conference room.	Wɔyɛ nhyiam ahorow wɔ nhyiam dan no mu.
Look, he has known the child all his life.	Hwɛ, onim abofra no ne nkwa nna nyinaa.
He can make any decision he wants.	Obetumi asi gyinae biara a ɔpɛ.
Just another ordinary day.	Da foforo a ɛyɛ ɔkwan biara so ara kwa.
And in terms of money.	Na wɔ sika mu.
We can work with any situation.	Yebetumi de tebea biara ayɛ adwuma.
He was the culprit.	Ɔno ne nea na ɔyɛ bɔne no.
It was cold inside.	Ná awɔw wom wɔ ne mu.
The dog lies on the ground.	Ɔkraman no da fam.
One of many.	Pii mu biako.
But stay tuned.	Nanso tra ase hwɛ.
We cannot say whether it is true or false.	Yɛrentumi nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware anaa atoro.
At least that’s what he thought.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne nea na osusuw.
Go to my car.	Kɔ me kar no ho.
Likewise, in my opinion.	Saa ara nso na, wɔ m’adwene mu.
I have to think about that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw saa asɛm no ho.
It was on mine.	Ná ɛwɔ me de no so.
This is not a good thing.	Eyi nyɛ ade pa.
What an amazing group.	Kuw a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni.
I will give him that much.	Mede saa dodow no bɛma no.
The sin is in man.	Bɔne no wɔ onipa mu.
No fillers, just water.	Nneɛma a wɔde hyɛ mu biara nni hɔ, nsu kɛkɛ.
I see part of the story.	Mihu asɛm no fã bi.
You’re a girl.	Woyɛ abeawa.
That first time, and so many times after.	Saa bere a edi kan no, ne mpɛn pii saa wɔ ɛno akyi.
It’s amazing that it’s still going on.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ ɛda so ara kɔ so.
And our music, at least for a while, was good.	Na yɛn nnwom no, anyɛ yiye koraa no, bere tiaa bi no, na eye.
This money will be put to good use.	Wɔde sika yi bedi dwuma yiye.
There is another power involved.	Tumi foforo bi nso ka ho.
She put her foot on his hand.	Ɔde ne nan sii ne nsa so.
If only it were that simple.	Sɛ anka ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa a.
There are too many things.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ dodo.
Look what that girl had done.	Hwɛ nea na saa abeawa no ayɛ.
My father is a very awesome person.	Me papa yɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hu paa.
He wasn't pretty.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He had only one leg.	Ná ɔwɔ nan biako pɛ.
It’s nothing else either.	Ɛnyɛ biribi foforo nso.
You are only human, whether you like it or not.	Woyɛ onipa nkutoo, sɛ́ wopɛ anaasɛ wompɛ.
No one goes that far.	Obiara nkɔ akyiri saa.
He is getting taller every day.	Ɔreyɛ tenten kɛse da biara.
I still don’t know much about him.	Meda so ara nnim ne ho nsɛm pii.
I just can’t get enough of this.	Me ntumi nnya eyi kɛkɛ.
Even for a moment.	Bere tiaa bi mpo.
So we can have our own home.	Enti yebetumi anya yɛn ankasa fie.
The day of the week.	Da a ɛwɔ dapɛn no mu.
Your time, not mine.	Wo bere so, ɛnyɛ me de.
Give them the money to buy these things.	Ma wɔn sika a wɔde bɛtɔ saa nneɛma yi.
This is a very important job.	Eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛho hia yiye.
I did it early today.	Meyɛɛ no ​​ntɛm nnɛ.
He had as much right to be here as anyone else.	Ná ɔwɔ hokwan sɛ ɔwɔ ha te sɛ obiara.
But make no mistake.	Nanso nni mfomso biara.
I could totally do with it anyway.	Ná metumi ne no ayɛ koraa wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
Like, last resort.	Te sɛ, ɔkwan a etwa to.
They used the power.	Wɔde tumi no dii dwuma.
He ran into the room.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ dan no mu.
He wants to pursue his film career.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ne sini adwuma no.
It was more of a mind game than anything.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene mu agoru sen biribiara.
Give me the money.	Fa sika no ma me.
That’s hardly true.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno nyɛ nokware.
It was generally the most exciting moment of the night.	Mpɛn pii no, na ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ anigye sen biara wɔ anadwo no mu.
I was really happy.	Ná mewɔ anigye ankasa.
The new system was difficult.	Ná nhyehyɛe foforo no yɛ den.
The same is true of yours.	Saa ara na wo de nso te.
Here is a truth.	Nokware bi ni.
It all started with one man’s work.	Ne nyinaa fii ase wɔ ɔbarima biako adwuma mu.
And something went wrong.	Na biribi anyɛ yiye.
I go by many names.	Mede din pii kɔ.
It’s too hot for me today.	Ɛyɛ hyew dodo ma me nnɛ.
You want money.	Wopɛ sika.
It’s a great idea.	Ɛyɛ adwene kɛse.
There is nothing we could do that we could not do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ a na yɛrentumi nyɛ.
Good evening to both of you.	Anwummere pa ma mo baanu nyinaa.
It seems to be new.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ foforo.
I clenched my fists tightly.	Mede me nsa bɔɔ mu denneennen.
I think they were pretty good.	Misusuw sɛ na wɔyɛ papa yiye.
How great it is.	Sɛnea ɛyɛ kɛse.
I hope your current job does the same.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo mprempren adwuma no nso yɛ saa ara.
It looks great in any setting.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye wɔ tebea biara mu.
However, the concept does not present the whole picture.	Nanso, adwene no mfa mfonini no nyinaa mma.
This room was also empty.	Ná hwee nni saa dan yi nso mu.
You have to live with everyone.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne obiara te.
So many people take this route every day.	Enti nnipa pii fa saa kwan yi so da biara.
So so did I, too.	Enti saa ara na me nso.
He should want better.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔpɛ nea eye sen saa.
It was a long one.	Ná ɛyɛ tenten bi.
I'm doing something else.	Meyɛ biribi foforo.
I don’t know if that’s surprising.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno yɛ nwonwa anaa.
But it’s not any good.	Nanso ɛnyɛ papa biara.
He was good to me.	Ná ɔyɛ papa ma me.
I don’t want to be one of those people.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa nnipa no mu biako.
I'm just saying it is.	Meka kɛkɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
Believe me now.	Gye me di mprempren.
I think it’s the same.	Misusuw sɛ ɛte saa.
He did it well.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​yiye.
Recently he had a lot to say.	Nnansa yi ara na na ɔwɔ pii ka.
He wishes he was somewhere else.	Ɔpɛ sɛ anka ɔwɔ baabi foforo.
He was the only one there.	Ná ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
I'm sorry about everything.	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ biribiara ho.
Eventually the dog ate the cat.	Awiei koraa no, ɔkraman no dii ɔkraman no.
It’s an interesting lesson.	Ɛyɛ adesua a ɛyɛ anigye.
The goods had to be moved.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde nneɛma no kɔ baabi foforo.
People began to panic.	Nkurɔfo fii ase bɔɔ hu.
The kids can’t take it.	Mmofra no ntumi mfa.
He slammed his hat on the bus.	Ɔde ne kyɛw bɔɔ bɔs no mu.
Fortunately, he is strong.	Nea eye ne sɛ, ne ho yɛ den.
Stay in the car.	Tra kar no mu.
No big deal here.	Asɛm kɛse biara nni ha.
Everyone needs good friends.	Obiara hia nnamfo pa.
Never, not under any circumstances.	Ɛnyɛ da, ɛnyɛ wɔ tebea biara mu.
Defendants do not dispute this point.	Wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho to wɔn so no nnye asɛm yi ho akyinnye.
I lived at home with my mom and dad.	Ná me ne me maame ne me papa te fie.
But that’s not what he wants to hear.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte.
The mistake is entirely his fault.	Mfomso no yɛ ne mfomso koraa.
He loves you.	Ɔpɛ wo.
But they were indeed very interested.	Nanso na wɔn ani gye ho kɛse ampa.
Follow the path.	Di ɔkwan no akyi.
He is not a debtor.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ɔde ka.
It is easy to use.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
One of them was really cute.	Ná wɔn mu biako ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
There is no opportunity.	Hokwan biara nni hɔ.
There had to be more.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma pii ka ho.
You might say that’s not a big deal.	Ebia wobɛka sɛ ɛno nyɛ ade kɛse.
He was very fond of music.	Ná nnwom ani gye ho kɛse.
The reason for this is this.	Nea enti a ɛte saa ne eyi.
He would do anything for you.	Anka ɔbɛyɛ biribiara ama wo.
It looks and feels brand new.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ foforo koraa na ɛte nka.
The same is true of your child.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ wo ba no ho.
There is hope.	Anidaso wɔ hɔ.
Can you believe it?	So wubetumi agye adi?
So do you, too.	Saa ara na wo nso.
Someday, just not this day.	Da bi, ɛnyɛ da yi ara kwa.
I can't say when.	Mintumi nka bere bɛn.
However, the reason seems to be a matter of money.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea nea enti a ɛte saa no yɛ sika ho asɛm.
It was a strange thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He knows what it’s like.	Onim sɛnea ɛte.
Or maybe they do.	Anaasɛ ebia wɔyɛ saa.
It’s a very, very exciting experience.	Ɛyɛ anigye kɛse paa.
Nothing is easy.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
And it was still very hot.	Na na ɛda so ara yɛ hyew kɛse.
Almost but not quite.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nanso ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
So, there is usually room, too.	Enti, mpɛn pii no, baabi wɔ hɔ, nso.
That’s always been the case, and probably always will be.	Saa na ɛte bere nyinaa, na ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
But even that wasn’t all.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɛno mpo ne ne nyinaa.
It’s very true.	Ɛyɛ nokware paa.
I’m enjoying it now.	M’ani gye ho mprempren.
They’re interested in you.	Wɔn ani gye wo ho.
I want to stay with you.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo tra.
I would appreciate any help with that.	M’ani begye mmoa biara a wɔde ma wɔ saa asɛm no ho no ho.
Two years have passed.	Mfe abien na atwam.
It was even worse, in a way.	Ná ɛyɛ bɔne sen saa mpo, wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
It’s a really good letter.	Ɛyɛ krataa pa ankasa.
It may or may not be the truth.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nokware no anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
They are very popular.	Wɔyɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse.
I invested immediately.	Mede sika hyɛɛ mu ntɛm ara.
That was easy money.	Na ɛno yɛ sika a ɛnyɛ den.
But he knew the song.	Nanso na onim dwom no.
There is no better time than now.	Bere biara nni hɔ a eye sen mprempren.
The real problem is obvious.	Ɔhaw ankasa no da hɔ.
It’s still working.	Ɛda so ara reyɛ adwuma.
However, we can see for sure.	Nanso, yebetumi ahu ho yiye.
The big news is this.	Asɛm kɛse no ne eyi.
Thank you very, very much.	Meda mo ase paa, pii paa.
He had hair too.	Ná ɔno nso wɔ ti nhwi.
You are beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ.
My feet are wet.	Me nan ayɛ nsu.
Lunch is included.	Awia aduan ka ho.
Forget all about that.	Wo werɛ mfi saa asɛm no nyinaa.
I didn’t want one.	Ná mempɛ biako.
Information must travel from place to place and from time to time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nsɛm tu kwan fi baabi kɔ baabi ne bere ne bere mu.
The trouble started last month.	Ɔhaw no fii ase ɔsram a etwaam no.
You do the best you can, and you hope.	Woyɛ nea eye sen biara a wubetumi, na wowɔ anidaso.
Other than that, this one does.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, eyi yɛ saa.
Maybe it was the case.	Ebia na ɛte saa.
They were too fast.	Ná wɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
So, when will he go?	Enti, bere bɛn na ɔbɛkɔ?
You can’t see it.	Worentumi nhu.
The system certainly works.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nhyehyɛe no yɛ adwuma.
People keep telling us.	Nkurɔfo kɔ so ka kyerɛ yɛn.
The game was what it was.	Na agoru no yɛ nea na ɛte.
And yet, years later it’s still here.	Na nanso, mfe bi akyi no ɛda so ara wɔ ha.
They were weak.	Ná wɔyɛ mmerɛw.
On that day, there was also a full moon.	Saa da no, na ɔsram a ayɛ ma nso wɔ hɔ.
This is a remarkable one.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa.
It wasn’t part of the plan.	Na ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe no fã.
But it’s fun.	Nanso ɛyɛ anigye.
He knew they did.	Ná onim sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Our system produces many results.	Yɛn nhyehyɛe no ma nneɛma pii ba.
We just have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa ara kwa.
So be careful.	Enti hwɛ yiye.
But what you say is absolutely true.	Nanso nea woka no yɛ nokware koraa.
He made the arrangements well.	Ɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛe no yiye.
He has a wonderful face.	Ɔwɔ anim a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
If you want to.	Sɛ wopɛ a.
I had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
It was over.	Ná aba awiei.
I can’t do anything.	Mintumi nyɛ hwee.
You can’t help me in just one session anyway.	Worentumi mmoa me wɔ nhyiam biako pɛ mu ɔkwan biara so.
His father had spoken against him.	Ná ne papa kasa tiaa no.
I see that.	Mihu saa.
It’s mostly midnight.	Ɛyɛ anadwo fã kɛse no ara.
In a sense	Ɔkwan bi so no .
She’s beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ.
And that was definitely going to be a problem.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛno bɛyɛ ɔhaw.
Feed the dog.	Ma ɔkraman no aduan.
It’s not a plan.	Ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe.
But that is not the present situation.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mprempren tebea no ne saa.
They shouldn’t not have to.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Take that and say it all.	Ɛno fa ka ne nyinaa.
Or what it seemed to be.	Anaasɛ nea na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte no.
Are they the best.	So wɔyɛ nea eye sen biara.
In the exhibits.	Wɔ nneɛma a wɔde kyerɛ no mu.
He is, indeed, a very big boy!.	Ɔyɛ, ampa, abarimaa kɛse paa!.
Probably not the best.	Ebia ɛnyɛ nea eye sen biara.
They just do things.	Wɔyɛ ade ara kwa.
Anyone can come in.	Obiara betumi aba mu.
Forget about tomorrow.	Wo werɛ mfi ɔkyena ho asɛm.
It didn’t feel right.	Ná ɛnte nka sɛ ɛyɛ ade pa.
I want you to come with me.	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me ba.
Maybe that should be updated.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa asɛm no foforo.
It was too weird.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa dodo.
I knew him from the story.	Ná minim no fi asɛm no mu.
But there is nothing he can do about it.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
Except he had one.	Gye sɛ na ɔwɔ bi.
He seemed to like them.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye wɔn ho.
There were things that needed to be done.	Ná nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
You can add things as you like.	Wubetumi de nneɛma bi aka ho sɛnea wopɛ.
Money is not a language.	Sika nyɛ kasa.
It feels good to be getting stronger.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ anigye sɛ woreyɛ den kɛse.
None of them went on the field.	Wɔn mu biara ankɔ abɔnten so.
So it was obvious that something was wrong.	Enti na ɛda adi sɛ na biribi anyɛ yiye.
And we are more than happy to do it for free.	Na yɛn ani gye ho kɛse sɛ yɛbɛyɛ no kwa.
You never know how the situation will turn out.	Wunnim sɛnea tebea no bɛyɛ da.
Not that long ago.	Ɛnyɛ bere tenten a atwam ni saa.
Here is one of them.	Wɔn mu biako ni.
But eat now.	Nanso di mprempren.
And, it was important to me.	Na, na ɛho hia me.
He knew that only he could do it.	Ná onim sɛ ɔno nkutoo na obetumi ayɛ.
She had never looked so good.	Ná ne ho nyɛ fɛ saa da.
It was so much fun, so much fun.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye kɛse, na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
He doesn’t seem to have any close friends.	Ɛte sɛ nea onni nnamfo paa biara.
I couldn’t do that at all.	Ná mintumi nyɛ saa koraa.
Like it's no big deal.	Te sɛ nea ɛnyɛ ade kɛse.
They were very beautiful.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Remember, he came this way himself.	Kae sɛ ɔno ankasa baa saa kwan yi so.
They do a lot.	Wɔyɛ pii.
That’s the easy part.	Ɛno ne asɛm a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no.
It looked like him but it wasn’t.	Na ɛte sɛ ɔno nanso na ɛnte saa.
And this is really at issue here.	Na eyi ne nea ɛwɔ asɛm no mu ankasa wɔ ha.
Anyway trouble was over now for him .	Sɛnea ɛte biara no na ɔhaw aba awiei mprempren ama no .
He wants to talk to both of you.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne mo baanu nyinaa kasa.
He stepped closer to her.	Ɔde ne nan bɛn no.
That was a surprise.	Ná ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
Anyone can enjoy them.	Obiara betumi anya wɔn ho anigye.
I know it must be hard to describe.	Minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka ho asɛm.
I shouldn’t think it’s true.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
I need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
But there are some more important issues.	Nanso nsɛm bi wɔ hɔ a ɛho hia kɛse.
At the time I was going with someone else.	Saa bere no na me ne obi foforo rekɔ.
He looked at her with interest.	Ɔde anigye hwɛɛ no.
He doesn’t want anything to do with her anymore.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔne no bɛyɛ biribi bio.
I thought for the most part, our whole team did.	Misusuwii sɛ fã kɛse no ara no, yɛn kuw no nyinaa yɛɛ saa.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
It was a great movie.	Ná ɛyɛ sini kɛse bi.
There are two reasons for this.	Nneɛma abien nti na ɛte saa.
I’m also excited.	M’ani agye nso.
I just thought you wanted someone else.	Misusuwii kɛkɛ sɛ wopɛ obi foforo.
He is really strong.	Ɔyɛ den ankasa.
Not where one party is entirely successful.	Ɛnyɛ baabi a apontow biako di yiye koraa.
Just do it.	Yɛ kɛkɛ.
We used to be a group.	Kan no na yɛyɛ kuw.
No one had heard of them, and no one knew their names.	Ná obiara nte wɔn ho asɛm, na obiara anhu wɔn din.
This was a real group.	Ná eyi yɛ kuw ankasa.
There is no one.	Obiara nni hɔ.
The most amazing pictures.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen biara.
That view was not popular here.	Ná saa adwene no ani nnye ho wɔ ha.
What a good news.	Asɛm pa bɛn ara ni.
Whatever it was, this man was not.	Nea na ɛyɛ biara no, na ɔbarima yi nyɛ saa.
A hand is provided.	Wɔde nsa bi ama.
You just can’t see them.	Worentumi nhu wɔn kɛkɛ.
Tell me what you think.	Ka nea wususuw ho kyerɛ me.
It may actually be quite simple.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa ankasa.
They are really easy.	Wɔyɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
It was after midnight.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo fã akyi.
But yet here we are.	Nanso nanso yɛwɔ ha.
I saw that in a movie.	Mihuu saa wɔ sini bi mu.
I have given you every idea while you are here.	Mede adwene biara ama wo bere a wowɔ ha no.
The feedback is either true or false.	Nsɛm a wɔka kyerɛ no yɛ nokware anaasɛ atoro.
How would I deal with my problem.	Ná mɛyɛ dɛn adi me haw no ho dwuma.
His hands fell from his legs.	Ne nsa hwee ase fii ne nan ho.
That's just a given.	Ɛno yɛ nea wɔde ama ara kwa.
Tell me about it.	Ka kyerɛɛ me.
It’s the same again.	Ɛte saa bio.
That had come down.	Ná ɛno aba fam.
He didn’t know anyone there.	Ná onnim obiara wɔ hɔ.
He is completely innocent.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho nni asɛm koraa.
His hair told him that something was wrong.	Ne ti nhwi no ka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye.
The incident happened a few days ago.	Asɛm no sii nna kakraa bi a atwam ni.
He would have a word with her later.	Anka ɔne no bɛka asɛm bi akyiri yi.
I wish we were in better shape.	Me yam a anka yɛwɔ tebea pa mu.
I’m really enjoying this.	M’ani gye eyi ho yiye.
Put us to the test.	Fa yɛn to sɔhwɛ mu.
And there was something.	Na biribi wɔ hɔ.
There was too much going on for me to go.	Ná nneɛma pii rekɔ so dodo sɛ mɛkɔ.
I have to say that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ.
They are very dangerous.	Wɔyɛ asiane kɛse paa.
There is food and water.	Aduan ne nsu wɔ hɔ.
When this happens.	Bere a eyi ba no.
But it seems that	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea .
They have to work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma.
He was my son.	Ná ɔyɛ me ba.
Maybe, for a while.	Ebia, bere tiaa bi.
They are of the same mind.	Wɔyɛ adwene koro no ara.
It’s not a good day for our kids, one way or another.	Ɛnyɛ da pa mma yɛn mma, ɔkwan bi so anaa ɔkwan foforo so.
Whatever this is.	Nea eyi yɛ biara.
However, it is not bad intellectually.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ bɔne wɔ adwene mu.
Someone has to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ.
Your mother was a whole other story.	Ná wo maame yɛ asɛm foforo koraa.
It's just a simple pleasant stay.	Ɛyɛ anigye tra a ɛnyɛ den ara kwa.
It’s more of the same thing.	Ɛyɛ ade koro no ara kɛse.
Nor are they alone.	Saa ara nso na ɛnyɛ wɔn nkutoo.
He’s excited about something.	N’ani agye biribi ho.
Can anyone help me.	So obi betumi aboa me.
It was a lot of fun.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
Make the arrangements.	Yɛ nhyehyɛe ahorow no.
The same can be seen below.	Saa ara na wubetumi ahu wɔ ase hɔ.
It wasn’t easy.	Ná ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
Part of that is a language issue.	Ɛno fã bi yɛ kasa ho asɛm.
I don’t know when.	Minnim bere bɛn.
He was at the meeting.	Ná ɔwɔ nhyiam no ase.
I think he is there.	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ.
All of this will take time.	Eyi nyinaa begye bere.
He was a very wealthy man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔwɔ sika yiye.
At least three are too many.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, abiɛsa na ɛdɔɔso dodo.
Is it a dog or a cat?	Ɛyɛ ɔkraman anaa ɔkraman?
Indeed,.	Ampa ara,.
He didn’t know that.	Ná onnim saa.
We have a lot in common.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ pɛ.
Good kids, both of them.	Mmofra pa, wɔn baanu nyinaa.
I just love his music.	M’ani gye ne nnwom ho ara kwa.
It doesn’t even look like it’s been used.	Ɛnte sɛ nea wɔde adi dwuma mpo.
I knew him now.	Ná minim no mprempren.
It has worked well.	Ayɛ adwuma yiye.
The food was out of reach for the dog.	Ná aduan no ntumi nkɔ hɔ mma ɔkraman no.
Please, you have to trust me.	Mesrɛ wo, ɛsɛ sɛ wugye me di.
He wasn’t feeling well.	Ná ne ho nyɛ no den.
You know a great deal.	Wunim ade kɛse bi.
Surely he did not have one.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, na onni bi.
I wasn’t used to that.	Ná ɛnyɛ saa na meyɛ me su.
And the next day.	Na ɛda a edi hɔ no.
Or in the case of.	Anaasɛ wɔ asɛm no mu.
The point is, it isn’t.	Asɛm no ne sɛ, ɛnte saa.
But he had no idea where he was.	Nanso na onni baabi a ɔwɔ ho adwene biara.
But this would be a mistake.	Nanso eyi bɛyɛ mfomso.
Nor is it final.	Saa ara nso na ɛnyɛ nea etwa to.
There was absolutely nothing.	Ná hwee nni hɔ koraa.
And here’s the weird thing.	Na ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa no ni.
So glad you are with us today.	Enti anigye sɛ wo ne yɛn wɔ hɔ nnɛ.
I knew a lot about it.	Na minim ho nsɛm pii.
There is nothing he can see that he does not like.	Biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ahu a n’ani nnye ho.
We’re interested in it.	Yɛn ani gye ho.
My dog ​​was lying by the door.	Ná me kraman no da ɔpon no ho.
You don’t have to go alone.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wo nkutoo kɔ.
This is not the situation in this case.	Eyi nyɛ tebea a ɛwɔ asɛm yi mu.
The music was not fake, that was his language.	Ná nnwom no nyɛ atoro, na ɛno ne ne kasa.
He took me to dinner.	Ɔde me kɔɔ anwummere aduan.
I need to talk to one of you about this more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne mo mu biako kasa fa eyi ho kɛse.
But think again.	Nanso susuw ho bio.
Same goes for everyone, really.	Saa ara na ɛte ma obiara, ampa.
You can’t do that with every painting.	Worentumi nyɛ saa wɔ mfonini biara ho.
That’s something that’s important to me.	Ɛno yɛ biribi a ɛho hia me.
And after that, that’s me.	Na ɛno akyi no, ɛno ne me.
Run faster and faster!	Tu mmirika ntɛmntɛm!
My son needs to sleep.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ba no da.
I love that girl.	M’ani gye saa abeawa no ho.
On the ground.	Wɔ fam.
The Book of Life.	Nkwa Nhoma.
And thank you again.	Na meda wo ase bio.
But it is not human.	Nanso ɛnyɛ onipa de.
I understand that point.	Mete saa asɛm no ase.
It was just down the street.	Na ɛwɔ abɔnten so ara kwa.
I have to tell them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wɔn.
She decided to work at home.	Ɔyɛɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛyɛ adwuma wɔ fie.
However, there was someone else.	Nanso, na obi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
I felt, for the first time, that I was a man like everyone else.	Metee nka, nea edi kan no, sɛ meyɛ ɔbarima te sɛ obiara.
And something else.	Na biribi aka.
Maybe I could go on.	Ebia na metumi akɔ so.
I don’t know how many days it was.	Minnim nna dodow a na ɛyɛ.
However, that will happen.	Nanso, ɛno bɛba.
There are many interesting things to see here.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ anigye a wubetumi ahu wɔ ha.
It has been around for years.	Ɛwɔ hɔ mfe pii ni.
Like it was mine.	Te sɛ nea na ɛyɛ me de.
He was a great guy.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse.
He is with them now.	Ɔne wɔn wɔ hɔ mprempren.
And whatever happened in it.	Na nea esii wɔ mu biara.
I loved everything about tonight.	M’ani gyee anadwo yi ho biribiara ho.
It may be more dangerous if you are familiar with it.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nea asiane wom kɛse sɛ wunim no yiye.
It was a very bad time for me.	Ná ɛyɛ bere bɔne paa ma me.
I can’t say that.	Mintumi nka saa.
Shortly thereafter.	Ɛno akyi bere tiaa bi.
None of them really.	Wɔn mu biara ankasa.
That’s me right there in the picture.	Ɛno ne me wɔ hɔ ara wɔ mfonini no mu.
The child's mother and father go outside.	Abofra no maame ne ne papa kɔ abɔnten.
There is nothing left.	Biribiara nni hɔ a aka.
Later, another man came to the door.	Akyiri yi, ɔbarima foforo baa ɔpon no ano.
Everyone turns to him.	Obiara dan kɔ ne nkyɛn.
It seemed like a great idea at the time.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwene kɛse saa bere no.
However, we need to be confident and hopeful.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde yɛn ho to so na yɛwɔ anidaso.
But none of this went to him.	Nanso eyi mu biara ankɔ ne nkyɛn.
Take my hand.	Fa me nsa.
I would appreciate if you could point me in that direction if so.	M’ani begye ho sɛ wubetumi akyerɛ me saa kwan no sɛ ɛte saa a.
But make sure you know what you are doing and why.	Nanso hwɛ hu sɛ wunim nea woreyɛ ne nea enti a woreyɛ.
I look forward to working with you again.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ me ne wo bɛyɛ adwuma bio.
He didn't want to talk about it.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka ho asɛm.
The very difficult one.	Nea ɛyɛ den yiye no.
It had to be easy enough for anyone off the street.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ ma obiara a onni abɔnten so.
In winter, days are longer and nights are shorter.	Awɔw bere mu no, nna yɛ tenten na anadwo yɛ tiaa.
But this article does not provide that scenario.	Nanso asɛm yi mfa saa tebea no mma.
That was a while ago.	Ɛno yɛ bere tiaa bi a atwam ni.
You just bring your money.	Wo de wo sika ba ara kwa.
He was in it.	Ná ɔwɔ mu.
That’s an awful lot of people.	Ɛno yɛ nnipa pii a ɛyɛ hu.
I just think about it.	Misusuw ho ara kwa.
I believe in myself.	Migye me ho di.
I believe you are right.	Migye di sɛ woayɛ no yiye.
But enough from me.	Nanso ɛdɔɔso fi me hɔ.
This did solve my problem.	Eyi dii me haw no ho dwuma ampa.
No need for any other language.	Nhia kasa foforo biara.
We will work on something.	Yɛbɛyɛ biribi ho adwuma.
I can’t see him.	Mintumi nhu no.
He could save her.	Ná obetumi agye no nkwa.
This is no accident.	Eyi nyɛ akwanhyia.
I’d appreciate any ideas.	M’ani begye adwene biara ho.
Many people use bicycles.	Nnipa pii de sakre di dwuma.
Just in a different way.	Wɔ ɔkwan foforo so ara kwa.
The drive took hours.	Kar no gyee nnɔnhwerew pii.
People do terrible, terrible things.	Nkurɔfo yɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ hu, ɛyɛ hu.
You can’t see them.	Worentumi nhu wɔn.
You can travel all night.	Wubetumi atu kwan anadwo mũ no nyinaa.
He and his wife have two children.	Ɔne ne yere wɔ mma baanu.
These things did not come to him easily.	Saa nneɛma yi amma ne nkyɛn ntɛm.
This may solve your problem.	Ebia eyi bedi wo haw no ho dwuma.
But it is not true.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nokware.
I like a lot of them.	M’ani gye wɔn mu pii ho.
About his children.	Ne mma ho.
It’s my song.	Ɛyɛ me dwom.
You are warm now.	Wo ho ayɛ hyew mprempren.
I was very impressed with that.	M’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho kɛse.
It was just a lot of money.	Ná ɛyɛ sika pii ara kwa.
Nor does anyone now.	Saa ara nso na obiara nyɛ saa mprempren.
Don’t tell him.	Mma wo nka nkyerɛ no.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni ho.
Everyone needs to be brought inside.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde obiara ba mu.
That was exciting.	Ná ɛno yɛ anigye.
Without a doubt, we do.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
We’ll be fine.	Yɛbɛyɛ yiye.
And try he did.	Na bɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
It’s much bigger than that.	Ɛyɛ kɛse sen saa koraa.
There were no children.	Ná mmofra biara nni hɔ.
He actually got on with it.	Ɔne no kɔɔ so ankasa.
At any price.	Wɔ bo biara mu.
This street was here.	Ná saa abɔnten yi wɔ ha.
That needs to end.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ba awiei.
She's really nice.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
I was a big deal.	Ná meyɛ ade kɛse bi.
It’s in our nature.	Ɛwɔ yɛn su mu.
So it was a very interesting book.	Enti na ɛyɛ nhoma a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
This is too important.	Eyi ho hia dodo.
I had a dress.	Ná mewɔ atade bi.
I saw him at the party.	Mihuu no wɔ apontow no ase.
He is not perfect.	Ɔnyɛ pɛ.
I think of my wife and children.	Misusuw me yere ne me mma ho.
There is nothing out here.	Biribiara nni ha akyi.
This will get easier with repetition.	Eyi bɛyɛ mmerɛw bere a woyɛ no mpɛn pii no.
We can build one for you.	Yebetumi asi biako ama wo.
But that is not true.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ nokware.
It needs to be used by the police.	Ɛho hia sɛ polisifo de di dwuma.
The house faces the road.	Ofie no hwɛ kwan no anim.
There was little we could do about that now.	Ná kakraa bi na yebetumi ayɛ wɔ saa asɛm no ho mprempren.
It’s not enough.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
It’s that good.	Ɛyɛ papa saa.
This problem is getting worse.	Ɔhaw yi reyɛ kɛse.
I wanted to believe him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye no di.
Whenever he can be on them.	Bere biara a obetumi ayɛ wɔn so.
I have been working for this moment for a long time.	Mayɛ adwuma ama saa bere yi bere tenten.
Do you like music?	So w’ani gye nnwom ho?
There is nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
I don’t know if that’s still the case.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno da so ara te saa anaa.
This all happens very quickly.	Eyi nyinaa ba ntɛmntɛm yiye.
I thought it was a great idea.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ adwene kɛse.
Still a lot of fun though.	Da so ara yɛ anigye pii de, nanso.
You seem uncomfortable.	Ɛte sɛ nea wo ho nyɛ wo den.
You get it.	Wo nsa ka.
That’s the last one.	Ɛno ne nea etwa to.
The inside half was tough.	Ná fã a ɛwɔ mu no yɛ den.
Something was going on.	Ná biribi rekɔ so.
I trust him completely.	Mede me ho to no so koraa.
And she was beautiful.	Na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
But that doesn’t make him that weird.	Nanso ɛno mma ɔnyɛ nwonwa saa.
But it’s just words.	Nanso ɛyɛ nsɛm ara kwa.
He had to work in the morning.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma anɔpa.
They were all like that.	Ná wɔn nyinaa te saa.
It seemed very unlikely.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye koraa.
Many people will be there.	Nnipa pii bɛba hɔ.
So it will look like below.	Enti ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛwɔ ase ha yi.
There was a front and a back.	Na anim ne akyi wɔ hɔ.
Not in those cases.	Ɛnyɛ saa nsɛm no mu.
He has been doing so ever since.	Ɔyɛ saa fi saa bere no.
Books are a necessity.	Nhoma yɛ ade a nnipa hia.
I am very strong.	Me ho yɛ den yiye.
No one is perfect.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ pɛ.
Don’t get too excited yet, though.	Nanso, mma w’ani nnye dodo de besi nnɛ.
I never want this to happen.	Mempɛ sɛ eyi bɛba da.
Your sex is still the best.	Wo ne wo nna da so ara yɛ nea eye sen biara.
This turns out to be a lie.	Eyi dan atoro.
It was a pleasure to be around them.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye sɛ wobɛka wɔn ho.
And maybe that’s what it was.	Na ebia ɛno ne nea na ɛte.
So enough, good.	Enti ɛdɔɔso, eye.
I saw his eyes.	Mihuu n’ani.
You want to know he’s there in her eyes.	Wopɛ sɛ wuhu sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ wɔ n’ani so.
That sounds interesting.	Ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
I didn’t want anyone else.	Ná mempɛ obi foforo biara.
That’s what he would have said.	Saa na anka ɔbɛka no.
Your children must come first.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo mma di kan.
I work after a job.	Meyɛ adwuma bi akyi.
Keep going and keep playing.	Kɔ so na kɔ so di agoru.
It’s just this one.	Ɛyɛ eyi ara kwa.
If you don’t know what it is you know.	Sɛ wunnim nea ɛyɛ a wunim.
Was that the case.	So na ɛte saa.
He didn't know what to say to her.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛka akyerɛ no.
Our team makes sure it’s awesome.	Yɛn kuw no hwɛ hu sɛ ɛyɛ hu.
Many people couldn’t keep up with him.	Nnipa pii antumi ankɔ so ne no abɔ.
I just had no intention of making them.	Ná minni adwene biara kɛkɛ sɛ mɛyɛ wɔn.
But not at that time.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa bere no.
Maybe there was something to that.	Ebia na biribi wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
My father didn’t say a word.	Me papa anka asɛm biako mpo.
They like your stuff.	Wɔn ani gye wo nneɛma ho.
Otherwise there was a problem.	Anyɛ saa a na ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
I have factual information.	Mewɔ nsɛm a ɛyɛ nokware.
That makes people interested.	Ɛno ma nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
So that’s the reason why.	Enti ɛno ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
He put his hand on hers.	Ɔde ne nsa too ne de no so.
Great job or bad job?.	Adwuma kɛse anaa adwuma bɔne?.
It’s pretty much the first time.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye nea edi kan.
I think you know where this is going.	Misusuw sɛ wunim baabi a eyi rekɔ.
However, this was not always the case.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na eyi te saa.
They only care if you seem weak.	Sɛ ɛte sɛ nea woayɛ mmerɛw nkutoo a, ɛho hia wɔn.
It was really really hard.	Ná ɛyɛ den ankasa ankasa.
He had never wanted anything so badly.	Ná ɔmpɛ biribi bɔne saa da.
I was a big one.	Ná meyɛ kɛse.
And this is important.	Na eyi ho hia.
His power was famous.	Ná ne tumi no agye din.
I like.	Mepɛ wo.
I don’t really do that.	Menyɛ saa ankasa.
The system is simple.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛ mmerɛw.
I did much more than that.	Meyɛɛ pii sen saa.
Boy with arms around girl.	Abarimaa a ɔde ne nsa abɔ abeawa no ho.
I love school.	M’ani gye sukuu ho.
The boy did look like himself.	Abarimaa no yɛɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa ampa.
They were definitely better than they were a week ago.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na wɔyɛ papa sen sɛnea na wɔyɛ dapɛn biako a atwam ni no.
Our money is their money.	Yɛn sika yɛ wɔn sika.
He was filled with joy like he had never known before.	Anigye te sɛ nea na onnim da no hyɛɛ no ​​ma koraa.
The meeting went nothing like he had planned.	Nhyiam no ankɔ biribiara sɛnea ɔyɛɛ ho nhyehyɛe no.
I don’t like cars.	M’ani nnye kar ho.
After that, he was alone.	Ɛno akyi no, na ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
I just couldn’t do it.	Na mintumi nyɛ kɛkɛ.
You just can’t beat the prices.	Worentumi nni nneɛma bo no so nkonim kɛkɛ.
Maybe he already has one.	Ebia ɔwɔ bi dedaw.
That was just two days ago.	Ɛno yɛ nna abien pɛ a atwam ni.
His hair flows.	Ne ti nhwi no sen.
In addition to that size.	Wɔ saa kɛse no akyi.
How quickly they forget.	Hwɛ sɛnea wɔn werɛ fi ntɛm ara.
But it is also usually very expensive.	Nanso mpɛn pii no, ne bo nso yɛ kɛse paa.
They should have been told.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka kyerɛ wɔn.
He must have known that.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na onim saa.
I believe this is not the case.	Migye di sɛ eyi nte saa.
He brings a complete game.	Ɔde agoru a edi mũ ba.
He always says that.	Ɔka saa bere nyinaa.
Those days are long gone for me.	Saa nna no atwam ama me akyɛ.
However, there are more reasons than just this.	Nanso, nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa sen eyi ara kwa.
Be very careful.	Hwɛ yiye paa.
This system works.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi yɛ adwuma.
I want to do that.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
Everyone had one.	Ná obiara wɔ bi.
I just kind of touched it.	Mede me nsa kaa mu kɛkɛ wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
It’s the kids.	Ɛyɛ mmofra no.
Always try to do your best.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wobɛyɛ nea wubetumi biara bere nyinaa.
He is doing a great job.	Ɔreyɛ adwuma kɛse.
It seems like you?.	Ɛte sɛ nea wo?.
I was at home.	Ná mewɔ fie.
It’s yours now.	Ɛyɛ wo de mprempren.
It has been so.	Ayɛ saa.
Maybe I’ll like you and me too maybe.	Ebia m’ani begye me ne wo nso ho ebia.
There was a lot going on in the house.	Ná nsɛm pii rekɔ so wɔ fie hɔ.
But this is a dangerous game.	Nanso eyi yɛ agoru a asiane wom.
And so I did that.	Na saa na meyɛɛ saa.
And it wasn’t the case.	Na ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte.
Great job and good price.	Adwuma kɛse ne bo pa.
Would that have been the case.	So anka ɛte saa.
I think you should come with me.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne me ba.
This is very common.	Eyi abu so yiye.
One should not forget.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obi ma ne werɛ fi.
But he knew nothing.	Nanso na onnim biribiara.
There is one point.	Asɛm biako wɔ hɔ.
Never say that.	Nka saa da.
Let things happen in their own time.	Ma nneɛma nkɔ so wɔ wɔn ankasa bere mu.
Feels like it’s urgent.	Te nka sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛm.
Maybe he was there.	Ebia na ɔwɔ hɔ.
His speech has been fascinating.	Ne kasa no ayɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
It’s a beautiful game.	Ɛyɛ agoru a ɛyɛ fɛ.
The business was successful for many years.	Adwuma no dii yiye mfe pii.
I don’t think anyone can!.	Minsusuw sɛ obiara betumi!.
It is, and yet it is not.	Ɛte saa, na nanso ɛnte saa.
The new one.	Foforo no.
Too late for that now.	Akyiri dodo ma ɛno mprempren.
He was wonderful, and he was wonderful.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa, na na ɔyɛ nwonwa.
See the first letter.	Hwɛ krataa a edi kan no.
But maybe not for long.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ bere tenten.
There would definitely be problems.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔhaw ahorow bɛba.
The thought shocked him.	Adwene no maa ne ho dwiriw no.
Everything will be fine after this weekend.	Biribiara bɛkɔ yiye wɔ dapɛn awiei yi akyi.
Just like you would at home.	Sɛnea anka wobɛyɛ wɔ fie no ara pɛ.
But, as you say, it may all be wrong.	Nanso, sɛnea woka no, ebia ne nyinaa yɛ mfomso.
Most of the time, he wanted to.	Mpɛn pii no, na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
We have the ability to think and plan.	Yɛwɔ tumi a yɛde susuw nneɛma ho na yɛyɛ nhyehyɛe.
In their own right.	Wɔ wɔn ankasa su so.
He could just see it now.	Ná obetumi ahu no mprempren ara kwa.
Put that down!	Fa saa asɛm no to fam!
He glanced around the room.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ dan no mu nyinaa.
Whoever did that to me.	Obiara a ɔyɛɛ me saa.
I can never dive.	Mintumi nkɔ nsu mu da.
How the system works.	Sɛnea nhyehyɛe no yɛ adwuma.
This week only!.	Dapɛn yi nkutoo!.
His way is too expensive.	Ne kwan no bo yɛ den dodo.
I've been involved for a while.	Mede me ho ahyɛ mu kakra.
What was he doing.	Dɛn na na ɔreyɛ.
This means nothing to him.	Eyi nkyerɛ hwee mma no.
I don’t want to know.	Mempɛ sɛ mihu.
This is not like you.	Eyi nte sɛ wo.
And she was beautiful.	Na na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
That’s how big you are.	Saa na wo kɛse te.
So I did that.	Enti meyɛɛ saa.
More space, elsewhere.	Baabi pii, wɔ baabi foforo.
But there are problems here.	Nanso ɔhaw ahorow wɔ ha.
He didn't want to be there.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ.
Check out his photos.	Hwɛ ne mfonini ahorow no.
Let the police handle this.	Ma polisifo nni eyi ho dwuma.
He was very horny.	Ná ne ho yɛ no hyew kɛse.
As if he had any power in this situation anyway.	Te sɛ nea ɔwɔ tumi bi wɔ tebea yi mu ɔkwan biara so.
That’s why I liked him so much.	Ɛno nti na na m’ani gye ne ho paa no.
He was very hot.	Ná ne ho yɛ hyew kɛse.
That was the way it was.	Saa na na ɛte.
I am doing really well.	Mereyɛ yiye ankasa.
This is how it is most of the time.	Eyi ne sɛnea ɛte mpɛn dodow no ara.
He could have left.	Ná obetumi afi hɔ akɔ.
I still can’t figure out how.	Meda so ara ntumi nhu sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ.
The meeting is adjourned.	Wɔde nhyiam no to nkyɛn.
I want no part of this.	Mempɛ eyi fã biara.
There is no right or wrong way.	Ɔkwan pa anaa ɔkwan bɔne biara nni hɔ.
Immerse yourself in the water several times.	Fa wo ho hyɛ nsu no mu mpɛn pii.
Maybe that will be the case.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ saa.
That was a disaster.	Ná ɛno yɛ asiane.
Have any of you ever used that system?	So mo mu biara de saa nhyehyɛe no adi dwuma pɛn?
It’s an edge without a doubt.	Ɛyɛ ano a akyinnye biara nni ho.
Do the simple game.	Yɛ agoru a ɛnyɛ den no.
Now you know more than this new thing.	Seesei wunim pii sen ade foforo yi.
Maybe that was okay.	Ebia na ɛno nyɛ hwee.
Don’t be so hard on yourself.	Mma wo ho nyɛ den saa.
Tell me your problem.	Ka wo haw no kyerɛ me.
He was perfect for her.	Ná ɔyɛ pɛ ma no.
I have worked longer than you.	Mayɛ adwuma akyɛ sen wo.
But when kids do something, it’s amazing.	Nanso sɛ mmofra yɛ biribi a, ɛyɛ nwonwa.
However, there was something.	Nanso, na biribi wɔ hɔ.
This happened to me almost alone.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ me nkutoo na eyi too me.
If he wasn’t already.	Sɛ na ɔnyɛ dedaw a.
The name of a boy.	Abarimaa bi din.
Can you spot the mistake?	So wubetumi ahu mfomso no?
He probably wanted something better for you than he had.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɔpɛ biribi a eye ma wo sen sɛnea na ɔwɔ no.
There was nothing he could make a case for.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi de ayɛ asɛm no ho asɛm.
He himself did nothing wrong.	Ɔno ankasa anyɛ bɔne biara.
He is absolutely good.	Ɔyɛ papa koraa.
This is one of his strongest shots.	Eyi yɛ ne tuo a ɛyɛ den sen biara no mu biako.
You are not beautiful.	Wonyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I’m so much happier now.	M’ani agye kɛse mprempren.
It just looks like me.	Ɛte sɛ me ara kwa.
The work is not too bad.	Adwuma no nyɛ bɔne dodo.
There are no clothes.	Ntade biara nni hɔ.
You and I, we have a lot in common.	Me ne wo, yɛyɛ pɛ pii.
It’s been a busy week.	Ɛyɛ dapɛn a adagyew nnim.
I couldn’t figure out what the problem could be.	Na mintumi nhu nea ɔhaw no betumi ayɛ.
It’s a little late.	Aka akyi kakra.
No one likes an intruder.	Obiara mpɛ obi a ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu.
But it was a good movie.	Nanso na ɛyɛ sini pa.
But things were not so good at home.	Nanso na nneɛma nyɛ papa saa wɔ fie.
He doesn’t do anything.	Ɔnyɛ hwee.
There is no price left for it.	Bo biara nni hɔ a aka ama no.
But let the boy go.	Nanso ma abarimaa no nkɔ.
What he did know was that it was true.	Nea na onim ampa ne sɛ na ɛyɛ nokware.
I had no interest in them.	Ná minni wɔn ho anigye biara.
That’s not why you’re here.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno nti na wowɔ ha no.
These words apply to you today.	Saa nsɛm yi fa wo ho nnɛ.
Someone is at the door.	Obi wɔ ɔpon no ano.
And they are strong.	Na wɔyɛ den.
If you don’t like it go somewhere else.	Sɛ w’ani nnye ho a kɔ baabi foforo.
Remember my opinion.	Kae m’adwene.
Thank you for it.	Meda wo ase wɔ ho.
And it’s pretty common.	Na ɛyɛ nea abu so yiye.
In my eyes.	Wɔ m’ani so.
That’s what it’s full of.	Ɛno ne nea ɛyɛ ma.
Nothing but trouble.	Biribiara nni hɔ gye ɔhaw.
I never wanted this to happen.	Ná mempɛ sɛ eyi ba da.
And so we become a new person.	Na saa na yɛyɛ onipa foforo.
It was difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den.
It’s just that we do that.	Ɛyɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa ara kwa.
He tucked his gun under his bed.	Ɔde ne tuo no hyɛɛ ne mpa ase.
I think they should all win.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn nyinaa di nkonim.
I spent the afternoon with them.	Me ne wɔn dii awia no.
The next time is the last.	Bere a edi hɔ no ne nea etwa to.
I don’t have to tell you what this could mean.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meka nea eyi betumi akyerɛ kyerɛ wo.
They seem to do their job properly.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ wɔn adwuma no sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He had to be quick.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ntɛm.
But it was actually quite good.	Nanso na eye koraa ankasa.
You only get one life.	Wo nsa ka nkwa biako pɛ.
That was just one time.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere biako pɛ.
No prison, no summer home.	Afiase biara nni hɔ, awɔw bere mu fie biara nni hɔ.
I do it every day.	Meyɛ no da biara da.
He put in the work.	Ɔde adwuma no hyɛɛ mu.
Back to work.	San kɔ adwuma mu.
I love these things.	M’ani gye saa nneɛma yi ho.
You can also check out the book there.	Wubetumi nso ahwɛ nhoma no wɔ hɔ.
I was very busy at work today.	Ná minni adagyew kɛse wɔ adwumam nnɛ.
However, it didn’t matter.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
But your father didn’t.	Nanso wo papa anyɛ saa.
He had money at all.	Ná ɔwɔ sika koraa.
The expensive one.	Nea ne bo yɛ den.
People don’t do that.	Nnipa nyɛ saa.
The work took hours.	Ná adwuma no gye nnɔnhwerew pii.
I had no chance.	Ná minni hokwan biara.
So part of it was not surprising.	Enti ne fã bi anyɛ nwonwa.
Look at the picture of the dog.	Hwɛ ɔkraman no mfonini no.
Show him how to do it.	Kyerɛ no sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
I enjoyed tonight.	M’ani gyee anadwo yi ho.
I don't know how to use it, or how to use it.	Minnim sɛnea wɔde di dwuma, anaa sɛnea wɔde di dwuma.
There is danger here.	Asiane wɔ ha.
Good on the water too.	Eye wɔ nsu no so nso.
The meeting did not go well.	Nhyiam no ankɔ yiye.
This is something that should not be forgotten.	Eyi yɛ biribi a ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛn werɛ fi.
A good person might do the same.	Ebia na onipa pa nso bɛyɛ saa ara.
You are you, and nothing else is.	Woyɛ wo ho, na biribi foforo biara nyɛ saa.
But the meeting never happened.	Nanso nhyiam no amma da.
There were three classes.	Ná wɔyɛ adesua ahorow abiɛsa.
I don’t know what to do with him.	Minnim nea menyɛ no.
The latter is as hard as the former is easier.	Nea etwa to no yɛ den te sɛ nea kan no yɛ mmerɛw no.
I would give my life for them.	Anka mede me nkwa bɛma ama wɔn.
For me, one thing is for sure.	Wɔ me fam no, ade biako yɛ nokware.
He just touched it.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ho ara kwa.
You see it in his paintings.	Wuhu wɔ ne mfonini ahorow mu.
He has to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
None of us are perfect.	Yɛn mu biara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ pɛ.
I know it doesn’t really matter.	Minim sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee ankasa.
But not quite as it really is.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛte ankasa no.
I understand time.	Mete bere ase.
Keep your eyes open.	Ma w’ani nna hɔ.
Maybe for hours.	Ebia nnɔnhwerew pii.
Things are not that simple.	Nneɛma nyɛ mmerɛw saa.
But this couldn’t be further from the truth.	Nanso eyi ntumi nkɔ akyiri mfi nokware no ho.
That’s just too scary.	Ɛno yɛ hu dodo ara kwa.
Hands and feet are strong.	Nsa ne nan yɛ den.
There is no danger.	Asiane biara nni hɔ.
But this is the last chance.	Nanso eyi ne hokwan a etwa to.
Everyone talks about this.	Obiara ka eyi ho asɛm.
That in itself will be difficult.	Ɛno ankasa bɛyɛ den.
We all looked at him.	Yɛn nyinaa hwɛɛ no.
So, you are whole only when you see.	Enti, bere a wuhu nkutoo na woyɛ mũ.
What that means is that it doesn’t matter.	Nea ɛno kyerɛ ne sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
A lot can happen during that time.	Pii betumi asi wɔ saa bere no mu.
Eye for them.	Eye ma wo.
I placed them by the back door.	Mede wɔn sii akyi pon no ho.
He headed for the door.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ɔpon no ano.
No one else is alive.	Obi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɔte ase.
I could force you.	Ná metumi ahyɛ wo.
And yet here you are.	Na nanso wo ni.
He had two conditions.	Ná ɔwɔ tebea abien.
It was late, he knew.	Ná aka akyi, na onim.
I don’t want to do anything.	M’ani nnye ho sɛ mɛyɛ biribiara.
Every day was the same.	Ná da biara da yɛ pɛ.
That was the message we received.	Ɛno ne asɛm a yɛn nsa kaa no.
How hot is the water?	Nsu no yɛ hyew dɛn?
Serving me the food must have been a test.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na aduan no a wɔde maa me no yɛ sɔhwɛ.
I couldn’t do anything.	Ná mintumi nyɛ hwee.
That has definitely affected my work ethic.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno aka sɛnea meyɛ adwuma no.
He almost drove off the sidewalk.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔde kar no fii ɔkwan a ɛda hɔ no so.
I absolutely loved this book.	M’ani gyee nhoma yi ho koraa.
And pretty much all he knew.	Na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nea onim no fã kɛse.
So it’s very simple.	Enti ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
They don’t have to do things.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ nneɛma.
As much as possible, he would be late.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye biara no, na ɔbɛka akyi.
There was absolutely nothing.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ koraa.
So this will be the first one.	Enti eyi bɛyɛ nea edi kan.
They were added to him.	Wɔde wɔn kaa ne ho.
He is just like most older people.	Ɔte sɛ nnipa a wɔn mfe akɔ anim dodow no ara ara pɛ.
Give me back my letter.	Fa me krataa no san ma me.
I had to watch it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ.
Or look at it.	Anaasɛ hwɛ.
The police looked into that.	Polisifo no hwɛɛ saa asɛm no.
Look at all these books.	Hwɛ nhoma ahorow yi nyinaa.
Here was a great opportunity.	Na hokwan kɛse bi wɔ ha.
I have nothing to solve this problem.	Minni biribiara a mede bedi ɔhaw yi ho dwuma.
There is so much to see.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ahu.
But this leads to errors.	Nanso eyi de mfomso ahorow ba.
People hit them, but not enough.	Nkurɔfo bɔ wɔn, nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
Here comes a group.	Ha na kuw bi ba.
This is my plan.	Eyi ne me nhyehyɛe.
There was no boy.	Ná abarimaa biara nni hɔ.
He didn't know why.	Ná onnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Maybe there is something we can do.	Ebia biribi wɔ hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ.
It’s way more complicated.	Ɛyɛ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ den sen saa.
For me it’s a bit of both.	Me fam no ɛyɛ abien no nyinaa kakra.
So you can’t assume that.	Enti worentumi nsusuw sɛ ɛte saa.
Work has also increased.	Adwuma nso ayɛ kɛse.
There was just so much he didn’t know about himself.	Na nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a onnim fa ne ho ara kwa.
I really have to work on making that happen.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma ankasa de ma ɛno ba mu.
Later, we may be able to deal with it.	Akyiri yi, ebia yebetumi adi ho dwuma.
Take everyone home or for the day.	Fa obiara kɔ fie anaa da no.
Summers are hot here.	Awɔw bere mu yɛ hyew wɔ ha.
He is in such a terrible state.	Ɔwɔ tebea a ɛyɛ hu saa mu.
I did that anyway.	Meyɛɛ saa ɔkwan biara so.
And at the right time, too.	Na bere a ɛsɛ mu nso.
I was kind of unfamiliar with it.	Ná meyɛ obi a minnim ho yiye wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
It is for informational purposes only.	Ɛyɛ nsɛm a wɔde bɛma nkutoo.
Almost no one knew the truth.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na obiara nnim nokware no.
Which will be good.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ papa.
We all had something in common.	Ná yɛn nyinaa wɔ biribi a ɛyɛ pɛ.
You can help me, if you want.	Wubetumi aboa me, sɛ wopɛ a.
Maybe that also lied about them.	Ebia ɛno nso dii atoro faa wɔn ho.
As now now will be later.	Sɛnea mprempren mprempren bɛyɛ akyiri yi no.
They are used.	Wɔde di dwuma.
I do that now, and it’s a huge help.	Meyɛ saa mprempren, na ɛyɛ mmoa kɛse.
But tell your mother.	Nanso ka kyerɛ wo maame.
People love a good story.	Nkurɔfo ani gye asɛm pa ho.
The quality is great.	Su no yɛ kɛse.
He really has a way about him.	Ɔwɔ ɔkwan bi fa ne ho ankasa.
The kitten did not know where she was.	Ná ɔkraman ba no nnim baabi a ɔwɔ.
You are great.	Woyɛ kɛse.
We will all be each other only.	Yɛn nyinaa bɛyɛ yɛn ho yɛn ho nkutoo.
You need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
Everyone needs money these days.	Obiara hia sika nnansa yi.
The end came too late for most people.	Awiei no baa akyiri dodo maa nnipa dodow no ara.
And it’s just this.	Na ɛyɛ eyi ara kwa.
Really easy to deliver.	Ankasa mmerɛw sɛ wɔde bɛma.
I have a car.	Mewɔ kar bi.
That is a fact of life.	Ɛno yɛ nokware asɛm.
And it was good, too.	Na eye nso.
This can be a bad thing.	Eyi betumi ayɛ ade bɔne.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni ho.
Thank you to all of them.	Meda wɔn nyinaa ase.
Tonight is not one of them.	Anadwo yi nyɛ wɔn mu biako.
I can't handle it now.	Mintumi nni ho dwuma mprempren.
They tell their stories.	Wɔka wɔn nsɛm.
Not even for a day.	Ɛnyɛ da koro mpo.
And they are involved.	Na wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu.
You have to be good.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ papa.
To do so, he needs to spend some time in his home.	Sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa a, ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde bere kakra tra ne fie.
The work was difficult.	Ná adwuma no yɛ den.
He knew it wasn’t about him.	Ná onim sɛ ɛnyɛ ne ho asɛm.
The installation .	Nneɛma a wɔde hyɛ mu no .
Too many things.	Nneɛma pii dodo.
But there is no reason to do so.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
At least after a while.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, bere tiaa bi akyi.
It shouldn’t matter that much.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛho hia saa.
There’s something human about them somewhere.	Biribi wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ onipa wɔ wɔn ho wɔ baabi.
That’s too expensive.	Ɛno bo yɛ den dodo.
And he does it well.	Na ɔyɛ no yiye.
He felt it too.	Ɔno nso tee nka.
But we can do something about it.	Nanso yebetumi ayɛ ho biribi.
Do .	Yɛ .
A great idea is a great idea.	Adwene kɛse yɛ adwene kɛse.
Or anyone you know.	Anaasɛ obiara a wunim no.
Do this in this way.	Yɛ saa kwan yi so.
I don’t think we ever will.	Minsusuw sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa da.
Consider what he knows.	Susuw nea onim no ho hwɛ.
But he hurts himself too much.	Nanso ɔyɛ ne ho yaw dodo.
I was beautiful.	Ná me ho yɛ fɛ.
This is the ideal situation.	Eyi ne tebea a eye sen biara.
I can’t understand it.	Mintumi nte ase.
This is not the case.	Eyi nyɛ saa.
It shouldn’t be a problem.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔhaw biara.
This was one of them.	Ná eyi yɛ biako.
I don’t know why that is.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
During that time.	Saa bere no mu.
My animal is trying to help us.	Me aboa no rebɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛboa yɛn.
This was a wise move.	Ná eyi yɛ ade a nyansa wom.
He immediately felt better.	Ntɛm ara na ne ho tɔɔ no.
He obviously has that.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔwɔ saa.
No one else was there at the time.	Ná obi foforo biara nni hɔ saa bere no.
Suppose that could be good too.	Fa no sɛ ɛno nso betumi ayɛ papa.
In this system.	Wɔ nhyehyɛe yi mu no.
But not now, not next year.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mprempren, ɛnyɛ afe a edi hɔ no mu.
There was police work to be done.	Ná polisifo adwuma wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
But two things went wrong.	Nanso nneɛma abien ankɔ yiye.
First, the water is warm.	Nea edi kan no, nsu no yɛ hyew.
Talk about them.	Ka wɔn ho asɛm.
All in all, I like him.	Ne nyinaa mu no, m’ani gye ne ho.
That’s not a sin.	Ɛno nyɛ bɔne.
There are some important animals here.	Mmoa ahorow bi a ɛho hia wɔ ha.
You forgot the food.	Wo werɛ fii aduan no.
He knew why he was doing this.	Ná onim nea enti a ɔreyɛ eyi.
He wants your child.	Ɔpɛ wo ba no.
It should be really good though.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ papa ankasa nanso.
It wasn’t what he wanted, but it would do for the time.	Na ɛnyɛ nea na ɔpɛ, nanso na ɛbɛyɛ ama saa bere no.
But in any case, he had not been able to enter it himself.	Nanso tebea biara mu no, na ɔno ankasa antumi ankɔ mu.
It was to be obvious that it was his last input into the system.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛda adi sɛ ɛno ne nea etwa to a ɔde hyɛɛ nhyehyɛe no mu.
It’s nice when someone offers to help.	Sɛ obi ka sɛ ɔbɛboa a, ɛyɛ anigye.
Please, you have to trust me now.	Mesrɛ wo, ɛsɛ sɛ wugye me di mprempren.
There may be two issues.	Ebia nsɛm abien bɛba.
I can see it with your eyes.	Metumi de w’ani ahu.
His legs don't work really well.	Ne nan nyɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
It had been like that since they were kids.	Ná ɛte saa fi bere a na wɔyɛ mmofra no.
But think about what you want too.	Nanso susuw nea wo nso wopɛ ho.
I can barely hear you.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nte wo.
He was brought to me.	Wɔde no baa me nkyɛn.
I heard about you.	Metee wo ho asɛm.
He works long hours.	Ɔyɛ adwuma nnɔnhwerew pii.
They are cute and fun to play with.	Wɔyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ anigye sɛ wo ne wɔn bedi agoru.
Proceed as planned.	Kɔ so sɛnea woayɛ ho nhyehyɛe no.
But he was there, and he would be.	Nanso na ɔwɔ hɔ, na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
He has done it well.	Wayɛ no yiye.
It’s been three hours.	Ɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa.
The man was just leaving.	Ná ɔbarima no rekɔ ara kwa.
It’s nothing else.	Ɛnyɛ biribi foforo biara.
Don’t use it unless you know exactly what you mean.	Mfa nni dwuma gye sɛ wunim nea wopɛ sɛ woka ankasa.
For this to work, it has to be the people.	Sɛ eyi bɛyɛ adwuma a, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nnipa no.
Things don’t have to be smooth.	Ɛho nhia sɛ nneɛma kɔ yiye.
Anyone can make alcohol.	Obiara betumi ayɛ nsa.
Many of us did.	Yɛn mu pii yɛɛ saa.
This doesn’t apply to me.	Eyi mfa me ho.
It’s not just words.	Ɛnyɛ nsɛm a wɔka kɛkɛ.
My house was not big enough.	Ná me fie nyɛ kɛse sɛnea ɛsɛ.
You want to do that.	Wopɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
It used to be a problem.	Kan no na ɛyɛ ɔhaw.
I've been thinking about you.	Mayɛ wo ho adwene.
It’s not anything.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara.
The bed was still there.	Ná mpa no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
There were several cars in the car.	Ná kar ahorow pii wɔ kar no mu.
I had to do something dramatic.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He admired his mother's keen taste.	Ná n’ani gye ne maame ani gye nneɛma ho yiye no ho.
It’s not that I don’t want to, I do.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ mempɛ, mepɛ.
In a way, he had that.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na ɔwɔ saa.
No one knew where he lived.	Ná obiara nnim baabi a ɔte.
So the problem is still relevant.	Enti ɔhaw no da so ara fa ho.
He didn't know why he should say anything.	Ná onnim nea enti a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka biribi.
And he had to tell someone.	Na na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ obi.
Check your height.	Hwɛ sɛnea wo tenten te.
That was my first thought.	Ɛno ne m’adwene a edi kan.
Most summers here are very hot.	Awɔw bere dodow no ara wɔ ha no yɛ hyew yiye.
That is also quite simple.	Ɛno nso yɛ mmerɛw koraa.
It’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
You are the only one who does that.	Wo nkutoo na woyɛ saa.
And the other three cases.	Na nsɛm abiɛsa a aka no nso.
I felt that way then and now.	Metee nka saa saa bere no ne mprempren nyinaa.
He happily drove home	Ɔde anigye de kar kɔɔ fie
Give him a good drink.	Ma no nsu pa.
Maybe it was a good idea to tell someone about it.	Ebia na ɛyɛ adwene pa sɛ wobɛka ho asɛm akyerɛ obi.
And that was exciting.	Na ɛno yɛ anigye.
The man was gone.	Ná ɔbarima no nni hɔ bio.
He hoped to work himself one day.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ da bi ɔno ankasa bɛyɛ adwuma.
Everything had to be in order.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ biribiara yɛ ne kwan so.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
Cars give way to buses.	Kar ahorow ma bɔs ahorow kwan.
But, you would never know.	Nanso, anka wunnim da.
There were a lot of kids around.	Na mmofra pii wɔ hɔ bɛyɛ.
This is for him.	Eyi yɛ ma no.
It was like my wife.	Ná ɛte sɛ me yere.
That is not the truth.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nokware no.
It was that big for me.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse saa ma me.
I did a great job.	Meyɛɛ adwuma kɛse.
To say you are normal is amazing.	Sɛ́ wobɛka sɛ woyɛ obi a ɔte ase no yɛ nwonwa.
This is a temporary work arrangement.	Eyi yɛ bere tiaa mu adwuma nhyehyɛe.
This is the same thing.	Eyi nso te saa ara.
He didn't seem to want to hear the truth.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔte nokware no.
You can lie.	Wubetumi adi atoro.
He has to drive fast.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka kar ntɛmntɛm.
We can’t have any more time.	Yɛrentumi nnya bere biara bio.
I will definitely be working with them a lot more.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ me ne wɔn bɛyɛ adwuma pii bio.
Talk about the best weekend ever.	Ka dapɛn awiei a eye sen biara ho asɛm.
He seemed to enjoy the music.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye nnwom no ho.
In a simpler way.	Wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw so.
Maybe I just don’t know how it works.	Ebia minnim sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma kɛkɛ.
He felt it too.	Ɔno nso tee nka.
That’s much harder to do.	Ɛno yɛ den kɛse sɛ wobɛyɛ.
The rest of the time must have been spent thinking about the problem.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ wɔde bere a aka no susuw ɔhaw no ho.
He really cared about what he did.	Ná nea ɔyɛ no ho hia no ankasa.
I will make the most of the situation.	Mede tebea no bedi dwuma yiye.
Not a problem at all.	Ɛnyɛ ɔhaw koraa.
We just do that.	Yɛyɛ saa ara kwa.
There are things you know and things you can prove.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a wunim ne nneɛma bi a wubetumi akyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
He loved the book.	Ná n’ani gye nhoma no ho.
They don’t all go that far.	Wɔn nyinaa nkɔ akyiri saa.
You said everyone started using it.	Wokae sɛ obiara fii ase de dii dwuma.
You have that instant feedback.	Wowɔ saa nsɛm a wɔka ntɛm ara no.
After a while, he regained consciousness.	Bere tiaa bi akyi no, n’adwene yɛɛ yiye.
It didn't seem like a big deal.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse.
There were many people there.	Ná nnipa pii wɔ hɔ.
There were no windows in her bedroom.	Ná mfɛnsere biara nni ne mpa mu.
It all had to come out.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ne nyinaa fi adi.
The child needs a variety of things.	Abofra no hia nneɛma ahorow ahorow.
I still want one.	Meda so ara pɛ biako.
The two already know each other.	Wɔn baanu nim wɔn ho wɔn ho dedaw.
That’s not good.	Ɛno nyɛ papa.
So what was that.	So na ɛno ne dɛn.
You can do me a favor.	Wubetumi ayɛ me yiye.
More information is needed on both of these scenarios.	Nsɛm pii ho hia wɔ tebea abien yi nyinaa ho.
But it’s good for me.	Nanso eye ma me.
I did just that and worked fine.	Meyɛɛ saa ara na meyɛɛ adwuma yiye.
People aren’t just things to work on.	Nkurɔfo nyɛ nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho adwuma kɛkɛ.
All you had to do was say that.	Nea na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ara ne sɛ wobɛka saa.
It was a significant amount of money.	Ná ɛyɛ sika a ɛho hia kɛse.
He wanted to do everything.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribiara.
I know a lot about your plans.	Minim nneɛma pii fa wo nhyehyɛe ho.
I saw a whole new side of my wife.	Mihuu me yere no fã foforo koraa.
Just their movie characters.	Wɔn sini mu nnipa a wɔyɛ wɔn ho mfonini no ara kwa.
I still have them just like before.	Meda so ara wɔ wɔn te sɛ kan no ara pɛ.
I can be a part of that.	Metumi ayɛ saa asɛm no fã.
Just a little while longer!	Bere tiaa bi pɛ!
But that’s only part of the story.	Nanso ɛno yɛ asɛm no fã bi kɛkɛ.
He doesn’t have much money.	Onni sika pii.
His mind was also clear.	Ná n’adwene nso mu da hɔ.
So here too.	Enti ha nso.
Even among themselves, there are innumerable faults.	Wɔ wɔn ho mpo no, mfomso nni ano.
He was overwhelmed with joy.	Anigye hyɛɛ no ​​so.
The simple but interesting picture.	Mfonini a ɛyɛ mmerɛw nanso ɛyɛ anigye no.
There had been a car accident.	Ná kar akwanhyia bi asi.
So, "what's for dinner?" 	Enti, "dɛn na ɛwɔ hɔ ma anwummere aduan?"
However, that is not the end of the matter.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no awiei.
This is a lie.	Eyi yɛ atoro.
There is no hope for them.	Anidaso biara nni hɔ ma wɔn.
I had no idea why it was happening.	Ná minnim nea enti a ɛrekɔ so.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
She was like her mother.	Ná ɔte sɛ ne maame.
It was an all-day offer.	Ná ɛyɛ da mũ nyinaa a wɔde ma.
He slammed both hands on the table.	Ɔde ne nsa abien no nyinaa bɔɔ pon no so.
Time flies and tomorrow is another day.	Bere kɔ so na ɔkyena yɛ da foforo.
That is very important.	Ɛno ho hia paa.
That is a huge undertaking.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma kɛse bi.
I knew he would love it.	Ná minim sɛ n’ani begye ho.
I was in love with him.	Ná m’ani gye ne ho.
It’s really something.	Ɛyɛ biribi ankasa.
His clothes became expensive.	Ne ntade bo yɛɛ den.
That’s very much so.	Ɛno yɛ saa paa.
I like them a lot.	M’ani gye wɔn ho kɛse.
We are here for you.	Yɛwɔ ha ma wo.
Take time, but not too much time.	Gye bere, nanso ɛnyɛ bere pii.
At least he didn't have to say the words.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na enhia sɛ ɔka nsɛm no.
His head was gone.	Ná ne ti nni hɔ bio.
This was a mistake.	Ná eyi yɛ mfomso.
But it’s not too big either.	Nanso ɛnyɛ kɛse dodo nso.
Or a bedroom.	Anaasɛ mpa bi.
This is a test, after all.	Eyi yɛ sɔhwɛ, ne nyinaa akyi no.
We can’t really do that.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ saa ankasa.
It was definitely happening.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛrekɔ so.
It’s the first thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a edi kan.
That’s a fact.	Ɛno yɛ nokware.
They have to do one thing, or another.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ade biako, anaasɛ ade foforo.
I don’t always like him.	M’ani nnye ne ho bere nyinaa.
That is the case in this work.	Saa na ɛte wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
Now we have more or less perfect rights.	Seesei yɛwɔ hokwan a edi mũ kɛse anaa kakraa bi.
You don’t want to look too big, do you?	Wompɛ sɛ wo ho yɛ kɛse dodo, ɛnte saa?
It’s not surprising.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa.
Look at this.	Hwɛ eyi.
This is the big one.	Eyi ne kɛse no.
We all know what happened next.	Yɛn nyinaa nim nea esii wɔ ɛno akyi.
We are all one.	Yɛn nyinaa yɛ biako.
He must have been.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɔte saa.
He doesn't know what to say.	Onnim nea ɔbɛka.
There was a cold one last night.	Awɔw bi sii anadwo a etwaam no.
This can be dangerous.	Eyi betumi ayɛ asiane.
That is the situation in this case.	Saa na tebea no te wɔ asɛm yi mu.
Do it for your comments or comments.	Yɛ no ma wo nsɛm anaa nsɛm a woka kyerɛ wo no.
It doesn’t have to be more complicated than that.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ den sen saa.
You can tell, right?.	Wubetumi ahu, ɛnte saa?.
This is just one city.	Eyi yɛ kurow biako pɛ.
Just like new.	Te sɛ nea ɛyɛ foforo ara pɛ.
No one can drive away.	Obiara ntumi nka kar nkɔ.
You have to like that one.	Ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye saa biako no ho.
I set the table for dinner.	Mede pon no sii hɔ maa anwummere aduan.
I had no such interest.	Ná minni anigye biara a ɛte saa.
Maybe we’ll do that.	Ebia yɛbɛyɛ saa.
You are hopeless.	Wo ho nni anidaso.
You know, it was kind of both.	Wunim, na ɛyɛ abien no nyinaa wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
I wasn’t either, and neither was he.	Ná menyɛ saa ara, na na ɔno nso nyɛ saa ara.
So good enough.	Enti eye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
And what is this? 	Na dɛn ne eyi?
I’ll be happy with it.	M’ani begye ho.
This year more than ever.	Afe yi sen bere biara.
I think this is a great idea.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ adwene kɛse.
I don’t even know what it looks like.	Minnim sɛnea ɛte mpo.
It’s my father.	Ɛyɛ me papa.
But that wasn’t the point.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
I know he knows about us.	Minim sɛ onim yɛn ho asɛm.
Dinner was a feast!	Ná anwummere aduan no yɛ apontow!
That’s just human nature.	Ɛno yɛ onipa su ara kwa.
I hope you enjoy them.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye wɔn ho.
This was his favorite part of the job.	Ná eyi ne adwuma no fã a n’ani gye ho paa.
This is wrong, in his opinion.	Eyi yɛ mfomso, wɔ n’adwene mu.
That’s the whole problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no nyinaa.
The boy had evidently had enough.	Ɛda adi sɛ na abarimaa no adi aduan a ɛdɔɔso.
Too many people liked it.	Nnipa pii ani gyee ho dodo.
We had a lot of that back then, too.	Ná yɛwɔ saa nneɛma no pii saa bere no, nso.
It’s the story you gave them.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a wode maa wɔn no.
And that’s why she’s with him.	Na ɛno nti na ɔne no wɔ hɔ no.
Don’t go into the house.	Mma nkɔ fie hɔ.
Not so with humans. 	Ɛnte saa wɔ nnipa fam. 
you just don’t understand.	wo nte ase kɛkɛ.
Interesting news here.	Nsɛm a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ ha.
This is usually successful.	Eyi taa di yiye.
I never knew my father.	Na minnim me papa da.
It really does.	Ɛyɛ saa ankasa.
Nothing goes to them, nothing.	Biribiara nkɔ wɔn nkyɛn, biribiara nni hɔ.
He didn’t either.	Ɔno nso anyɛ saa.
Make that what you want.	Fa ɛno nyɛ nea wopɛ.
I thought he could play.	Misusuwii sɛ obetumi adi agoru.
It was my size.	Ná ɛyɛ me kɛse.
And maybe we are diverse enough after all, too.	Na ebia yɛyɛ ahorow ahorow sɛnea ɛsɛ wɔ ne nyinaa akyi, nso.
I could use some help here, she told him.	Metumi de mmoa bi adi dwuma wɔ ha, ɔka kyerɛɛ no.
I don’t want to go home.	Mempɛ sɛ mekɔ fie.
The dog snuggled up to him.	Ɔkraman no de ne ho bɔɔ no.
One of them was wearing a dress.	Ná wɔn mu biako hyɛ atade.
So you know.	So wunim.
Also, describe what happened then.	Bio nso, kyerɛ nea esii saa bere no.
First, we can do nothing.	Nea edi kan no, yɛrentumi nyɛ hwee.
You know for sure.	Wunim ampa.
Another boy lies beside her.	Abarimaa foforo nso da ne nkyɛn.
He’s doing some good.	Ɔno na ɔreyɛ papa bi.
His mother had been in a car accident.	Ná ne maame nyaa kar akwanhyia.
So it’s not the same thing.	Enti ɛnyɛ ade koro.
No one ever knows.	Obi nnim da.
In this way the	Saa kwan yi so no .
For his part.	Wɔ ne fam no.
Moreover, the power was with the person who entrusted it to him.	Bio nso, na tumi no wɔ onipa a ɔde ahyɛ ne nsa no nkyɛn.
You want them to behave.	Wopɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔn ade.
That he has done something terrible.	Sɛ wayɛ biribi a ɛyɛ hu.
But this is hardly the whole story.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ eyi nyɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
There are many problems.	Ɔhaw ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
And that makes it all the more important.	Na ɛno ma ɛho hia kɛse.
The water feature had a name.	Ná nsu a ɛwɔ hɔ no wɔ din.
The street was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ abɔnten hɔ ma.
No one saw them.	Obiara anhu wɔn.
I hope you know what this is.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wunim nea eyi yɛ.
I was in the business.	Ná mewɔ adwuma no mu.
I wanted to make an important statement.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ asɛm a ɛho hia.
Her innocence was so remarkable.	Ná ne ho a ne ho nni asɛm no yɛ nwonwa yiye.
I don’t know what this song is about.	Minnim nea dwom yi fa ho.
It was a good game plan.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru ho nhyehyɛe pa.
So, what can we do?	Enti, dɛn na yebetumi ayɛ?
The reason for this is unclear.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no mu nna hɔ.
Language was crucial here.	Ná kasa ho hia kɛse wɔ ha.
I wanted to know everything about him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu ne ho biribiara.
Will this provide.	So eyi bɛma.
It was very nice and obviously old.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ yiye na ɛda adi sɛ ɛyɛ dedaw.
That’s everyone.	Ɛno ne obiara.
They are very beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I know everything, remember.	Minim biribiara, kae.
Our plans.	Yɛn nhyehyɛe ahorow.
Except many people don’t know.	Gye sɛ nnipa pii nnim.
I only have pictures of you as a child.	Mewɔ wo mfonini ahorow nkutoo sɛ abofra.
It certainly wasn’t easy.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
Think of his mother.	Susuw ne maame ho hwɛ.
She was too strong for him.	Ná ne ho yɛ den dodo ma no.
We had to be .	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛbɛyɛ .
But that’s next week.	Nanso ɛno ne dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
He stuck his head out the window.	Ɔde ne ti faa mfɛnsere no mu.
He’s not a bad boy.	Ɔnyɛ abarimaa bɔne.
It felt cold.	Ná ɛte nka sɛ awɔw wom.
You are cold and wet.	Woyɛ awɔw na woayɛ nsu.
Please take me home.	Mesrɛ wo, fa me kɔ fie.
But she was beautiful, too.	Nanso na ne ho yɛ fɛ, nso.
But it was too bad for me.	Nanso na ɛyɛ me bɔne dodo.
Take it down a little.	Fa kɔ fam kakra.
They were a fast team last week.	Na wɔyɛ kuw a wɔde mmirika tu mmirika dapɛn a etwaam no.
My father used to come here with me.	Ná me papa taa ne me ba ha.
Tell me where he is.	Ka baabi a ɔwɔ kyerɛ me.
These things take a lot of time.	Saa nneɛma yi gye bere pii.
I don't really know what this statement means.	Minnim nea saa asɛm yi kyerɛ ankasa.
People had been partying all night.	Ná nkurɔfo akɔ so ayɛ apontow anadwo mũ no nyinaa.
It’s not that there isn’t a plan.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ nhyehyɛe biara nni mu.
Just say nothing, and be very nice to me later.	Nka hwee kɛkɛ, na yɛ me yiye paa akyiri yi.
He wants me to tell him.	Ɔpɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no.
He had a gun.	Na ɔwɔ tuo.
This surprises me.	Eyi yɛ me nwonwa.
There is no big deal.	Asɛm kɛse biara nni hɔ.
Only a few of them do.	Wɔn mu kakraa bi pɛ na wɔyɛ saa.
Once again, there is no danger here.	Saa bere yi nso, asiane biara nni ha.
Never for a moment.	Ɛnyɛ bere tiaa bi mpo da.
Thank you very much.	Meda wo ase pii.
He was in a strong mood all afternoon.	Ná ɔwɔ adwene a ɛyɛ den awia mũ no nyinaa.
It’s such a terrible, terrible day.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ hu, ɛyɛ hu saa.
Maybe that’s the reason.	Ebia ɛno ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
Which hurt him too.	Nea ɛno nso yɛɛ no ​​yaw.
There is hope for everyone.	Anidaso wɔ hɔ ma obiara.
If not, they might have to take it outside.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ebia na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde kɔ abɔnten.
A good place to focus.	Baabi pa a obetumi de n’adwene asi biribi so.
I used to work here you know.	Ná meyɛ adwuma wɔ ha wunim.
You don’t have to be friends with them.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wo ne wɔn bɛyɛ nnamfo.
Why would he .	Dɛn nti na na ɔbɛyɛ .
Man, it was beautiful.	Onipa, na ɛyɛ fɛ.
Sleep in, sleep in.	Da mu, da mu.
He had nothing else to say.	Ná onni biribi foforo a ɔbɛka.
But it’s not what you think it is.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea wususuw sɛ ɛte no.
The innovation was an immediate success.	Ade foforo no dii yiye ntɛm ara.
His wish came true.	Nea ɔpɛ no baa mu.
I know everything you have to say.	Minim biribiara a ɛsɛ sɛ woka.
I trust them completely.	Migye wɔn di kosi ase.
I talked to them about the situation today.	Me ne wɔn kasa faa tebea no ho nnɛ.
So it’s very hard to act.	Enti ɛyɛ den yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ ade.
Nothing mattered.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na ɛho hia.
He knew exactly what he could do to his father.	Ná onim nea obetumi ayɛ ne papa no ankasa.
Most of us don’t.	Yɛn mu dodow no ara nyɛ saa.
The words remained.	Nsɛm no kɔɔ so traa hɔ.
Currently this is the only thing you can do.	Mprempren eyi nkutoo ne ade a wubetumi ayɛ.
Apparently, that is the only real power.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛno nkutoo ne tumi ankasa.
We had a job for this guy.	Na yɛwɔ adwuma bi a yɛde bɛyɛ saa ɔbarima yi.
And it was so.	Na ɛte saa.
Every single month.	Ɔsram biako biara.
That was the same thing.	Ná ɛno nso te saa ara.
That one alone isn’t the whole truth.	Saa biako no nkutoo na ɛnyɛ nokware no nyinaa.
But it is what it is.	Nanso ɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ.
They did buy that themselves.	Wɔn ankasa tɔɔ saa ampa.
That’s it for us.	Ɛno ne ma yɛn.
It’s going so fast.	Ɛrekɔ ntɛmntɛm saa.
And they are generally more accurate.	Na mpɛn pii no wɔyɛ nea edi mu kɛse.
Please accept them as they are, your children.	Mesrɛ mo sɛ gye wɔn sɛnea wɔyɛ, mo mma.
This is incredibly hard to do.	Eyi yɛ den ma ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ wobɛyɛ.
That is very important to me.	Ɛno ho hia me paa.
There is a past.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a atwam.
That was a huge mistake.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfomso kɛse.
I can’t go through this anymore.	Mintumi mfa eyi mu bio.
It was anything but certain.	Na ɛyɛ biribiara gye sɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nokware.
It doesn’t need much water.	Enhia nsu pii.
It was the same tonight.	Saa ara na na ɛte anadwo yi.
The su forces are still strong.	Su tumi ahorow no da so ara yɛ den.
That wasn’t on us.	Ná ɛno nni yɛn so.
Tell us what you think.	Ka nea wususuw ho kyerɛ yɛn.
He’ll be interested.	N’ani begye ho.
He had grown up.	Ná wayɛ kɛse.
He didn’t know.	Ná onnim.
That was a very interesting thing.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
We don’t like that.	Yɛn ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
This is the first time such an incident has happened.	Eyi ne bere a edi kan a asɛm a ɛte saa asi.
Prices are very expensive here.	Nneɛma bo yɛ den yiye wɔ ha.
What mattered were the characters.	Nea na ɛho hia ne nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no.
I have been saying this for years.	Mede mfe pii aka eyi.
He knew how important this could be.	Ná onim sɛnea eyi betumi ayɛ nea ɛho hia.
It’s just beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa.
There was nothing behind us.	Ná biribiara nni yɛn akyi.
Mother is by his side.	Maame wɔ ne nkyɛn.
It’s not an easy thing to do.	Ɛnyɛ ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
But there is nothing.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ.
Don’t let it be anything else.	Mma ɛnyɛ biribi foforo biara.
This year never came.	Afe yi amma da.
The more information you provide the better.	Dodow a wode nsɛm pii ma no dodow no ara na eye.
The truth is no one knows.	Nokware no ne sɛ obiara nnim.
We need to do something about it now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi mprempren.
And he wanted her.	Na na ɔpɛ no.
Of many, there was that one.	Wɔ pii mu no, na saa biako no wɔ hɔ.
She's really pretty.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
I think of it like great sleep.	Misusuw ho te sɛ nna kɛse.
They acted on this strange story.	Wɔde saa asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa yi yɛɛ ade.
But there is never any doubt.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho da.
That’s why they’re kids.	Ɛno nti na wɔyɛ mmofra no.
He knows you are here.	Onim sɛ wowɔ ha.
More testing had to be done. 	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ sɔhwɛ pii. 
The game is set in a fake room.	Wɔde agoru no asi dan bi a ɛnyɛ nokware mu.
Nothing about that.	Biribiara nni saa asɛm no ho.
The man who knows you.	Ɔbarima a onim wo no.
And in a way.	Na ɔkwan bi so.
Follow this thing day and night.	Di saa ade yi akyi anadwo ne awia.
Now everything works fine.	Seesei biribiara yɛ adwuma yiye.
They don’t have to be perfect.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ pɛ.
But don’t just take our word for it.	Nanso mfa yɛn asɛm no nyɛ hwee kɛkɛ.
This was not to be done.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi.
More importantly, do you enjoy what you’re doing?	Nea ɛho hia sen saa no, so w’ani gye nea woreyɛ no ho?
Not so much and not so fast.	Ɛnyɛ pii saa na ɛnyɛ ntɛmntɛm saa.
Not now and not later.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren na ɛnyɛ akyiri yi.
It’s so nice.	Ɛte saa.
But it was really, really great.	Nanso na ɛyɛ kɛse ankasa, ankasa.
Either way, it’s exciting.	Ɔkwan biara so no, ɛyɛ anigye.
It sounds like a lot of fun.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye pii.
At room temperature.	Wɔ dan mu hyew mu.
The man spoke to the man.	Ɔbarima no kasa kyerɛɛ ɔbarima no.
However, that wasn’t the point.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
I might say a year and a half.	Ebia mɛka sɛ afe ne fã.
It just amazes me.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa ara kwa.
All of those things are real.	Saa nneɛma no nyinaa yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Otherwise, it would be better.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, anka ɛbɛyɛ papa.
I can't fly with this anymore.	Mintumi mfa eyi tu bio.
He has been in the business for a long time.	Ɔde bere tenten ayɛ adwuma no.
I can’t get a gun.	Mintumi nnya tuo.
It shouldn’t be a problem for them.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔhaw ma wɔn.
He too did really well.	Ɔno nso yɛɛ no ​​yiye ankasa.
Make it easier.	Ma ɛnyɛ den.
You may already be working on those.	Ebia woreyɛ saa nneɛma no ho adwuma dedaw.
My people know very little about it.	Me nkurɔfo nim ho nsɛm kakraa bi pɛ.
Or the simpler one.	Anaasɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw no.
You had better come with me.	Anka eye sɛ wo ne me bɛba.
A rare man.	Ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ na.
Do your own thing.	Yɛ wo kwan so.
That was years and years ago.	Ɛno yɛ mfe ne mfe a atwam ni.
Besides, it’s not all that late.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa na aka akyi saa.
That means half the year is over.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ afe no fã aba awiei.
This house is great.	Saa ofie yi yɛ kɛse.
I could shoot him.	Ná metumi atu no tuo.
It had to be that way.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
It might be great, great.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ kɛse, kɛse.
It’s not more complicated than that.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den sen saa.
Or here and there.	Anaasɛ ha ha.
I don’t think he wants to, but he is.	Minsusuw sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa, nanso ɔte saa.
Or so he thinks.	Anaasɛ saa na osusuw.
Too long a time.	Bere tenten dodo.
At the time, it seemed like the wise thing to do.	Saa bere no na ɛte sɛ nea nyansa wom a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He hoped it was.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
A party by any other name is still a party.	Apontow a wɔde din foforo biara di dwuma no da so ara yɛ apontow.
But it was still something.	Nanso na ɛda so ara yɛ biribi.
Anything can be food.	Biribiara betumi ayɛ aduan.
Whatever that is.	Nea ɛno te biara.
But it was an awesome car.	Nanso na ɛyɛ kar a ɛyɛ hu.
Be afraid of him.	Yɛ hu no.
This is obviously not working.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nyɛ adwuma.
It’s not difficult.	Ɛnyɛ den.
You obviously have a passion for what you do.	Ɛda adi sɛ wowɔ nea woyɛ no ho anigye.
Just see if this works for you.	Hwɛ kɛkɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma ma wo anaa.
Right now.	Seesei ara.
No appointments are required.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe biara.
The next season is not much better.	Bere a edi hɔ no nyɛ papa pii.
You will become completely new.	Wobɛyɛ foforo koraa.
This is the idea behind it.	Eyi ne adwene a ɛwɔ akyi.
The day was going to be hot.	Ná ɛda no bɛyɛ hyew.
Things weren’t going well.	Ná nneɛma nkɔ yiye.
If you ever need me, for anything.	Sɛ wo hia me da bi a, biribiara ho.
They don’t do everything.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara na wɔyɛ.
The last of the lot.	Nea etwa to koraa.
I always seem to do this.	Ɛte sɛ nea meyɛ eyi bere nyinaa.
Maybe it’s his.	Ebia ɛyɛ ne de.
The accident happened last year.	Akwanhyia no sii afe a etwaam no.
I look forward to those days too.	Mehwɛ saa nna no nso kwan.
It’s a great city.	Ɛyɛ kurow kɛse bi.
He was here last year.	Ná ɔwɔ ha afe a etwaam no.
Not his real name.	Ɛnyɛ ne din ankasa.
In this way, however, all the details follow the same pattern.	Nanso saa kwan yi so no, nsɛm no nyinaa di nhyehyɛe koro akyi.
I only felt the hand.	Nsa no nkutoo na metee nka.
This method is simple and does not require complex processing.	Saa kwan yi yɛ mmerɛw na enhia sɛ wɔyɛ ho adwuma a ɛyɛ den.
They all play a role in the image quality.	Wɔn nyinaa di dwuma wɔ mfonini no su mu.
Often it is terrifying.	Mpɛn pii no ɛyɛ hu.
I can’t save anyone.	Mintumi nnye obiara nkwa.
He didn't mean to say that.	Ná ɔnyɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛka saa.
However, I had to apologize for last week.	Nanso, na ɛsɛ sɛ mepa kyɛw wɔ dapɛn a etwaam no ho.
It is up to you to bring this about.	Ɛyɛ wo na wubetumi de eyi aba.
I don’t want to do that.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
It was a new era.	Ná ɛyɛ bere foforo.
First of all, homemaking them.	Nea edi kan koraa no, ofie a wɔyɛ wɔn.
But don’t think I don’t like the food though.	Nanso nsusuw sɛ m’ani nnye aduan no ho de, nanso.
Or more of it.	Anaasɛ pii.
We all had our mistakes.	Yɛn nyinaa nyaa yɛn mfomso ahorow.
It’s still working.	Ɛda so ara reyɛ adwuma.
I was actually planning to do the same thing.	Ná mereyɛ nhyehyɛe ankasa sɛ mɛyɛ ade koro no ara.
And we do it quickly.	Na yɛyɛ no ntɛmntɛm.
give him time, and he can do well.	ma no bere, na obetumi ayɛ yiye.
But there was something about him.	Nanso na biribi wɔ ne ho.
You never knew me.	Wo ne me nnim da.
We can’t tell.	Yɛrentumi nhu.
Just go here.	Kɔ ha kɛkɛ.
Just one thing.	Ade biako pɛ.
Water is a filler.	Nsu yɛ ade a wɔde hyɛ mu.
It was terrible.	Ná ɛyɛ hu.
One evening, remember.	Da koro anwummere, kae.
I love pretty clothes.	M’ani gye ntade a ɛyɛ fɛ ho.
We can help each other but little.	Yebetumi aboa yɛn ho yɛn ho nanso kakraa bi.
It was a bit of fun, maybe, the first couple of times.	Na ɛyɛ anigye kakra, ebia, mpɛn abien a edi kan no.
Your mother is as beautiful as ever.	Wo maame ho yɛ fɛ te sɛ kan no.
He does everything for them.	Ɔyɛ biribiara ma wɔn.
The moon is a reflection of different waters.	Ɔsram yɛ ade a ɛda adi wɔ nsu ahorow mu.
He knew them both.	Ná onim wɔn baanu nyinaa.
It was something else.	Ná ɛyɛ ade foforo.
On to the big story of the day.	Wɔ da no mu asɛm kɛse no so.
There is no plan.	Nhyehyɛe biara nni hɔ.
I don’t like these weird things.	M’ani nnye saa nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa yi ho.
I’d rather do it this way.	M’ani begye sɛ mɛyɛ no saa kwan yi so.
Both wore equally interesting looks.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa hyɛ anim a ɛyɛ anigye saa ara.
So much happiness.	Anigye pii saa.
It doesn’t need any extra work to make it work.	Enhia adwuma foforo biara na ama ayɛ adwuma.
I already have enough money.	Mewɔ sika a ɛdɔɔso dedaw.
Everything went very smoothly.	Biribiara kɔɔ so yiye paa.
What are your remaining three days.	Dɛn ne wo nnansa a aka no.
But that night he was very happy.	Nanso saa anadwo no na n’ani agye paa.
That’s not something he can control at all.	Ɛno nyɛ biribi a obetumi adi so koraa.
Surprisingly, they did.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa no, na wɔyɛ saa.
Remember the last city.	Kae kurow a etwa to no.
We need to do this more often.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ eyi mpɛn pii.
Many were troubled.	Ná pii haw wɔn.
It has to be that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
Perhaps neither came here.	Ebia mu biara amma wɔ ha.
Really awesome stuff.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ hu ankasa.
But overall, it’s obvious.	Nanso ne nyinaa mu no, ɛda adi.
But you are used to it.	Nanso wo ho yɛ wo su.
And that might just work.	Na ebia ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
But if it’s our home, our kids, whatever.	Nanso sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn fie a, yɛn mma, nea ɛte biara.
At least that’s what it feels like.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne sɛnea ɛte nka.
Is something going on?	So biribi rekɔ so?
My dad couldn’t either, and he was in it.	Me papa nso antumi, na na ɔwɔ mu.
The layout was innovative and beautiful.	Ná nhyehyɛe no yɛ foforo na ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
But anything is possible.	Nanso biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye.
He was very nice to me.	Ná ɔyɛ me yiye paa.
Do more of them next year.	Yɛ wɔn mu pii afe a edi hɔ no.
The snake charmer impressed the cat.	Ɔwɔ a ɔyɛ ɔkraman no maa ɔkraman no ani gyee ne ho.
Only my head, arms, and legs are visible.	Me ti, me nsa, ne me nan nkutoo na ɛda adi.
Time was running short.	Ná bere ayɛ mmerɛw.
If anything, it was more so.	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, na ɛte saa kɛse.
They are a great group of kids.	Wɔyɛ mmofra kuw kɛse bi.
Someone with power.	Obi a ɔwɔ tumi.
She seemed really nice.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
It had actually been three years.	Ná ayɛ mfe abiɛsa ankasa.
He is not the best.	Ɔnyɛ nea eye sen biara.
So be honest with yourself.	Enti di wo ho nokware.
The water of life itself.	Nkwa nsu ankasa.
The situation was terrible.	Ná tebea no yɛ hu.
What is the time now?	Bere no ne dɛn mprempren?
I was surprised by it.	Ná ɛyɛ me nwonwa.
It is easy to use.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
She is alive and happy and free.	Ɔte ase na ɔwɔ anigye na ɔde ne ho.
I didn’t want to watch.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mehwɛ.
We can run beside the point.	Yebetumi atu mmirika wɔ asɛm no nkyɛn.
Or nothing else.	Anaasɛ biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
Like somehow it would.	Sɛnea ɔkwan bi so no, anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
It’s hot.	Ɛyɛ hyew.
So they do it over and over again.	Enti wɔyɛ no mpɛn pii.
No one is anyone else.	Obiara nyɛ obi foforo.
Many people approach them.	Nnipa pii bɛn wɔn.
This should tell us something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi ka biribi kyerɛ yɛn.
I had to see him at his house.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no wɔ ne fie.
I see that now.	Mihu saa mprempren.
Who doesn’t know what to say.	Nea onnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka.
Which is good.	Nea eye.
Something wrong.	Biribi bɔne.
They are always working.	Wɔyɛ adwuma bere nyinaa.
I can taste them.	Metumi aka wɔn ahwɛ.
I don’t know what this means.	Minnim nea eyi kyerɛ.
All that matters is that you have it.	Nea ɛho hia ara ne sɛ wowɔ bi.
I will give him that much.	Mede saa dodow no bɛma no.
Be the front, not the back.	Yɛ anim, na ɛnyɛ akyi.
I envy those people.	M’ani bere saa nkurɔfo no.
Maybe he made up the whole thing.	Ebia ɔno na ɔyɛɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
This was an opinion.	Ná eyi yɛ adwene a obi wɔ.
But let time work for you, rather than work for time.	Nanso ma bere nyɛ adwuma mma wo, sen sɛ wobɛyɛ adwuma ama bere.
There is that issue still.	Saa asɛm no wɔ hɔ a ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
So maybe there is something in it.	Enti ebia biribi wɔ mu.
We didn’t need to do anything with it.	Ná enhia sɛ yɛde yɛ biribi.
He liked me too.	Ɔno nso ani gyee me ho.
But this is not the point here.	Nanso ɛnyɛ eyi ne asɛm no wɔ ha.
It just doesn’t work.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
Thank you both so much!.	Meda mo baanu nyinaa ase pii!.
That leads to identity.	Ɛno de onipa a obi yɛ no ba.
Feedback is very important to us.	Nsɛm a wɔka kyerɛ ho hia yɛn yiye.
I can’t believe this either!	Me nso, mintumi nnye eyi nni!
The reason was simpler, more elegant.	Ná nea enti a ɛte saa no yɛ mmerɛw, na ɛyɛ fɛ sen saa.
He was with them.	Ná ɔne wɔn wɔ hɔ.
I didn’t want the day to end.	Ná mempɛ sɛ da no bɛba awiei.
View full size or view size.	Hwɛ ne kɛse nyinaa anaa hwɛ kɛse.
Remove the snow.	Yi fi hɔ.
He is very good.	Ɔyɛ papa paa.
It’s a great time for music.	Ɛyɛ bere a eye ma nnwom.
But that’s weird.	Nanso ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
Her hands were soft and warm.	Ná ne nsa yɛ mmerɛw na na ɛyɛ hyew.
Say or do nothing.	Nka anaa nyɛ hwee.
This makes him more dangerous.	Eyi ma ne ho yɛ hu kɛse.
What a good idea.	Adwene pa bɛn ara ni.
Just the way they do it.	Sɛnea wɔyɛ no ara pɛ.
I made it outside.	Meyɛɛ no ​​abɔnten.
I need to tell you something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribi kyerɛ wo.
It’s too hard.	Ɛyɛ den dodo.
I never knew you could do this.	Na minnim da sɛ wubetumi ayɛ eyi.
Except for that one other time, two years ago.	Gye saa bere foforo biako no, mfe abien a atwam ni no.
I received your letter.	Me nsa kaa wo krataa no.
Look at the pictures again.	Hwɛ mfonini ahorow no bio.
I know what you meant.	Minim nea na wopɛ sɛ woka.
This story is famous.	Saa asɛm yi agye din.
That’s just human nature.	Ɛno yɛ onipa su ara kwa.
But that is not how it should be.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
Participate as a group.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu sɛ kuw.
That’s what you have to do.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I rolled my eyes at them.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ wɔn anim.
For one thing.	Ade biako nti.
I knew he had done that.	Ná minim sɛ wayɛ saa.
Why would he do such a thing.	Dɛn nti na na ɔbɛyɛ ade a ɛte saa.
And that was the last one.	Na ɛno ne nea etwa to.
Frequently.	Ntɛm so.
I couldn’t sleep tonight.	Na mintumi nna anadwo yi.
Which, if you know me, is very rare.	Nea sɛ wunim me a, ɛho yɛ na yiye.
Each and every morning.	Anɔpa biara ne anɔpa biara.
Not a bad job as businesses go.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma bɔne sɛnea nnwuma kɔ no.
It wasn’t really him.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɔno ankasa.
You owe me	Wode me ka .
Put the kids on him.	Fa mmofra no hyɛ no so.
Not too happy with him.	Ɛnyɛ anigye dodo wɔ ne ho.
We can’t do that yet.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ saa de besi nnɛ.
Everyone knows this is impossible.	Obiara nim sɛ eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
That’s just the way it should be.	Saa ara ne ɔkwan a ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
He took her home.	Ɔde no kɔɔ fie.
Is anyone out there.	So obiara wɔ abɔnten.
But the group that has it.	Nanso kuw a ɛwɔ no.
Everyone could see that.	Ná obiara tumi hu saa.
Just tell me what you want.	Ka nea wopɛ kyerɛ me kɛkɛ.
So, keep it real, but keep it interesting.	Enti, ma ɛnyɛ nokware, nanso ma ɛnyɛ anigye.
He told me he could definitely help.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ obetumi aboa.
I'm taking you somewhere.	Mede wo rekɔ baabi.
Mistakes can be expensive as well.	Mfomso betumi ayɛ nea ne bo yɛ den nso.
Mine was too big.	Ná me de no ayɛ kɛse dodo.
Later, their final words followed.	Akyiri yi, wɔn nsɛm a etwa to no dii akyi.
It was just so exciting.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye ara kwa.
We’re all trying to work for the same thing.	Yɛn nyinaa rebɔ mmɔden sɛ yɛbɛyɛ adwuma ama ade koro no ara.
It’s a good one.	Ɛyɛ nea eye.
Nothing and no one.	Biribiara nni hɔ na obiara nni hɔ.
He was the only one in the room at the time.	Saa bere no na ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ dan no mu.
He has obviously done this before.	Ɛda adi sɛ wayɛ eyi pɛn.
This man has no money.	Saa ɔbarima yi nni sika biara.
You can even get out.	Wubetumi mpo afi adi.
All your friends are in town.	Wo nnamfo nyinaa wɔ kurow no mu.
Thank you for that.	Meda mo ase wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I agree with you there.	Me ne wo yɛ adwene wɔ hɔ.
Not any good right now.	Ɛnyɛ papa biara mprempren.
I can get there easily enough.	Metumi adu hɔ a ɛnyɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ.
They all wondered what he would say.	Wɔn nyinaa susuwii nea ɔbɛka ho.
I'll tell you how it is.	Meka sɛnea ɛte no.
This will be given to me.	Wɔde eyi bɛma me.
He was like most people in that way.	Ná ɔte sɛ nnipa dodow no ara wɔ saa kwan no so.
He hurt me.	Ɔyɛɛ me yaw.
This is true here too.	Eyi yɛ nokware wɔ ha nso.
He had a strong face.	Ná ɔwɔ anim a ɛyɛ den.
There were only a few words left.	Ná nsɛm kakraa bi pɛ na aka.
I can barely articulate the rest.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nka nea aka no nkyerɛ.
The project has had various names.	Adwuma no anya din ahorow.
Try hard.	Bɔ mmɔden kɛse.
However, there is more.	Nanso, pii wɔ hɔ.
It was wrong then and it’s wrong now.	Na ɛyɛ mfomso saa bere no na ɛyɛ mfomso mprempren.
Something made me do that.	Biribi maa meyɛɛ saa.
For all of us, and that includes.	Yɛn nyinaa fam, na ɛno nso ka ho.
He is hardly surprised.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ no nwonwa.
Nothing glamorous here.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ ha.
Get involved, get involved, get involved.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu, fa wo ho hyɛ mu, fa wo ho hyɛ mu.
I know that day means a lot to both of us.	Minim sɛ saa da no kyerɛ pii ma yɛn baanu nyinaa.
Everything seems to be going well.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara kɔ so yiye.
Lots of plans, lots of hope for today.	Nhyehyɛe pii, anidaso pii ma nnɛ.
It may be true.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nokware.
Everyone knows about you.	Obiara nim wo ho asɛm.
They really do work.	Wɔyɛ adwuma ankasa.
It was much better this way than the other way.	Ná eye koraa wɔ saa kwan yi so sen ɔkwan foforo no.
Either way, it had to be done.	Ɔkwan biara so no, na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Keep things moving.	Ma nneɛma nkɔ so.
He gave his house to his son.	Ɔde ne fie maa ne ba no.
Everyone made plays.	Obiara yɛɛ agoru ahorow.
That is nothing new.	Ɛno nyɛ ade foforo.
Make a plan, work with me.	Yɛ nhyehyɛe bi, wo ne me nyɛ adwuma.
Just like we do when we’re in the car.	Sɛnea yɛyɛ bere a yɛwɔ kar no mu no ara pɛ.
He is very happy.	Ɔwɔ anigye kɛse.
Everyone can see everyone else.	Obiara tumi hu obiara a aka no.
You put it in his hands.	Wode hyɛ ne nsa mu.
I know such a man.	Minim ɔbarima a ɔte saa.
That would be a great thing.	Ɛno bɛyɛ ade kɛse.
Anyway, we didn't care.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na ɛnyɛ yɛn asɛm.
And that costs money.	Na ɛno gye sika.
I've done that.	Mayɛ saa.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia.
Everything happened very quickly.	Biribiara sii ntɛmntɛm paa.
There is no money there.	Sika biara nni hɔ wɔ hɔ.
I don’t want to.	Mempɛ.
New jobs are a different story.	Nnwuma foforo yɛ asɛm foforo.
Look at yourself, how beautiful you are inside and out.	Hwɛ wo ho, sɛnea wo ho yɛ fɛ wɔ wo mu ne akyi.
Not even anyone really.	Obiara ankasa mpo.
Be better than this.	Yɛ papa sen eyi.
Therefore, the cost of the system will be high.	Enti, nhyehyɛe no ho ka bɛyɛ kɛse.
Got a phone and everything.	Nyaa telefon ne biribiara.
And why should you!.	Na dɛn nti na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa!.
However, this is only half the truth.	Nanso, eyi yɛ nokware no fã pɛ.
There is nothing you can do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
He didn't want to lie.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ odi atoro.
It’s not just about me.	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo ho asɛm.
That was a bad time.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere bɔne.
There are no human rights.	Nnipa hokwan biara nni hɔ.
I don’t want to go anywhere else.	Mempɛ sɛ mɛkɔ baabi foforo biara.
I think he tells it like it is.	Misusuw sɛ ɔka no sɛnea ɛte no.
It will just be a lot of walking.	Ɛbɛyɛ nantew pii kɛkɛ.
His power is real.	Ne tumi no yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
I had no plans.	Ná minni nhyehyɛe biara.
He’s the girl.	Ɔne abeawa no.
That doesn’t work.	Ɛno ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
He knows you are a very busy man.	Onim sɛ woyɛ ɔbarima a onni adagyew koraa.
You get the idea.	Wo nsa ka adwene no.
We can’t do that here.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ saa wɔ ha.
It’s way, way, more interesting that that sounds.	Ɛyɛ ɔkwan, ɔkwan, anigye kɛse sɛ ɛno te.
That’s not something you want to do in this case.	Ɛno nyɛ biribi a wopɛ sɛ woyɛ wɔ asɛm yi mu.
The kids are home today.	Mmofra no wɔ fie nnɛ.
I had lunch with him a month ago.	Me ne no dii awia aduan ɔsram biako a atwam ni.
Spend some time getting to know the system they use.	Fa bere kakra hu nhyehyɛe a wɔde di dwuma no.
But it is not the whole truth.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nokware no nyinaa.
Work is busy here.	Adwuma nni adagyew wɔ ha.
It was absolutely fascinating.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye koraa.
The two glanced at each other.	Wɔn baanu no de wɔn ani kyerɛɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
He was in deep debt.	Ná ɔde ka kɛse.
He spends all his time indoors.	Ɔde ne bere nyinaa tra dan mu.
He has a dog with him.	Ɔwɔ ɔkraman bi ka ne ho.
The results are the same.	Nea afi mu aba no ara.
Every weekend we had a great time.	Dapɛn awiei biara na yɛn ani gye paa.
But it really is.	Nanso ɛyɛ saa ankasa.
He owed me money.	Ná ɔde me ka.
But it is also expensive.	Nanso ne bo yɛ den nso.
This is very beautiful.	Eyi yɛ fɛ yiye.
They were just as good.	Ná wɔyɛ papa saa ara.
Water is essential for life.	Nsu yɛ ade a ɛho hia ma nkwa.
It’s not about the money.	Ɛnyɛ sika no ho asɛm.
People come every day.	Nkurɔfo ba hɔ da biara da.
And it still is, if you want to know.	Na ɛda so ara yɛ saa, sɛ wopɛ sɛ wuhu a.
He did everything else right.	Ɔyɛɛ biribiara a aka no yiye.
The easy way you have with each other.	Ɔkwan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw a mo ne mo ho mo ho wɔ.

But that doesn’t mean no one does.	Nanso ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ obiara nyɛ saa.
He was there.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ.
How many years have you worked here?	Mfe ahe na wode ayɛ adwuma wɔ ha?
Whoever had this do something needs to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara a na ɔwɔ eyi yɛ biribi no kɔ.
Return to this project.	San kɔ saa adwuma yi so.
Make it painful.	Ma ɛnyɛ yaw.
Somewhere, somehow, we lost sight of that last week.	Baabi, ɔkwan bi so no, yɛn ani fii saa asɛm no so dapɛn a etwaam no.
You’re amazing.	Wo ho yɛ nwonwa.
But there is no mistake.	Nanso mfomso biara nni hɔ.
He did, though, didn't he?'	Nanso, ɔyɛɛ saa, ɛnte saa?’.
No one knows for sure.	Obiara nnim no yiye.
Look at the floor.	Hwɛ fam no so.
I want you to bring it home a little bit.	Mepɛ sɛ wode ba fie kakra.
My father took me there with him.	Me papa de me kaa ne ho kɔɔ hɔ.
But he wanted her just the same.	Nanso na ɔpɛ no sɛnea na ɔpɛ no ara pɛ.
That was a great game.	Ná ɛno yɛ agoru kɛse.
She was taken to a group home.	Wɔde no kɔɔ kuw bi fie.
Or any other job either.	Anaasɛ adwuma foforo biara nso.
It must be optimized for the different applications.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no yiye ma nneɛma ahorow a wɔde di dwuma no.
We were the only ones quick at the front.	Ná yɛn nkutoo yɛ ntɛm wɔ anim.
However, it didn’t matter.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
Wish there were more like you.	Yɛ yam a anka pii a ɛte sɛ wo wɔ hɔ.
He has a plan that works every time.	Ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe bi a ɛyɛ adwuma bere biara.
Such a method.	Ɔkwan a ɛte saa.
Finally, have a picture.	Nea etwa to no, wɔ mfonini.
But it’s not too hard.	Nanso ɛnyɛ den dodo.
The system crashed again this morning.	Nhyehyɛe no san hwee ase anɔpa yi.
It’s just an amazing day.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
It’s what it is.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛte.
One that is not pretty.	Biako a ɛnyɛ fɛ.
There were many new faces.	Ná anim foforo pii wɔ hɔ.
She was so beautiful and happy.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye na na n’ani gye.
I can handle the cold.	Metumi adi awɔw no ho dwuma.
You just don’t get it.	Wo nnya bi kɛkɛ.
No work, no money.	Adwuma biara nni hɔ, sika biara nni hɔ.
But it was still a lot of fun.	Nanso na ɛda so ara yɛ anigye kɛse.
Most don’t even do it themselves.	Dodow no ara mpo wɔn ankasa nyɛ.
I was still like a child.	Ná meda so ara te sɛ abofra.
Go back to bed.	San kɔ mpa so.
I'm really sorry.	Mepa wo kyɛw ankasa.
We just do that too .	Yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa ara kwa .
And he was strong.	Na ɔyɛ den.
It was a new year.	Ná ɛyɛ afe foforo.
He knew he shouldn't have said that.	Ná onim sɛ anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔka saa.
He had been strong.	Ná wayɛ den.
The whole story is here.	Asɛm no nyinaa wɔ ha.
But right now was a testing time.	Nanso na mprempren ara yɛ sɔhwɛ bere.
Just wear comfortable shoes.	Hyɛ mpaboa a ɛyɛ fɛ kɛkɛ.
But use it sparingly.	Nanso fa di dwuma kakraa bi.
Give it a shot and see if it works for you.	Ma no tuo na hwɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma ma wo anaa.
The boy touched the dog's mouth.	Abarimaa no de ne nsa kaa ɔkraman no ano.
Language is powerful in this way.	Kasa wɔ tumi wɔ saa kwan yi so.
You have the story and the story has you.	Wowɔ asɛm no na asɛm no nso wɔ wo.
So, you have	Enti, wowɔ .
My hands of people.	Me nsa a ɛyɛ nnipa.
I found him in the stable.	Mihuu no wɔ mmoa dan no mu.
And yet he doesn’t like it.	Na nanso n’ani nnye ho.
I really love this book.	M’ani gye nhoma yi ho ankasa.
What matters to me.	Nea ɛho hia me.
I don’t know if he knows.	Minnim sɛ ebia onim anaa.
The story is familiar to most of us.	Asɛm no yɛ nea yɛn mu dodow no ara nim.
It was very popular.	Ná nkurɔfo ani gye ho yiye.
Try to be one of those people.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wobɛyɛ saa nnipa no mu biako.
His mother is not so happy.	Ne maame nni anigye saa.
I know you do what you can.	Minim sɛ woyɛ nea wubetumi.
My name was on it.	Ná me din wɔ so.
He is the one who made them all.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ wɔn nyinaa.
However, here we use a different approach.	Nanso, ha na yɛde ɔkwan foforo di dwuma.
He feels strongly about the issue.	Ɔte nka denneennen wɔ asɛm no ho.
Not now, maybe not again.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren, ebia ɛnyɛ saa bio.
I understand it very well.	Mete ase yiye.
One mistake leads to another.	Mfomso biako de foforo ba.
It would be best to do it down under here.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ yɛbɛyɛ no wɔ fam wɔ ha ase.
A significant number of projects remain.	Nnwuma dodow bi a ɛho hia da so ara wɔ hɔ.
He gives it to her.	Ɔde ma no.
She knew he was close to her.	Ná onim sɛ ɔne no bɛn no.
Mom knows somehow.	Maame nim ɔkwan bi so.
This is for two reasons.	Nneɛma abien nti na eyi te saa.
I'll give it a go.	Mede bɛma no akɔ.
His problem is about me.	Ne haw no fa me ho.
He is a person without money.	Ɔyɛ obi a onni sika.
It was easier this way.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw wɔ saa kwan yi so.
Don’t get in the water.	Mma nkɔ nsu no mu.
Do things that are interesting.	Yɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye.
Even in the story.	Wɔ asɛm no mu mpo.
Things were going on.	Ná nneɛma rekɔ so.
I still can’t believe it.	Meda so ara ntumi nnye nni.
There was a problem.	Ná ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
Not much at all.	Ɛnyɛ pii koraa.
They are just too many.	Wɔn dodow ara kwa.
We can have more just like them.	Yebetumi anya bi aka ho te sɛ wɔn ara pɛ.
Someone took me to the road.	Obi de me kɔɔ ɔkwan no ho.
He had no money.	Ná onni sika biara.
It was still an expensive project.	Ná ɛda so ara yɛ adwuma a ne bo yɛ den.
And what it did for me.	Na nea ɛyɛ maa me no.
Let the letter go.	Ma krataa no nkɔ.
And he was with her.	Na ɔno nso ka ne ho.
Man must save himself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ onipa gye ne ho.
I have a business to take care of.	Mewɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ so.
That time had passed.	Ná saa bere no atwam.
Who knows, you might be the lucky one.	Hena na onim, ebia wo na wobɛyɛ nea ɔwɔ anigye no.
That saved my life.	Ɛno gyee me nkwa.
You got to be happy.	Wo nyaa anigye.
But all in all, it was a great stay.	Nanso ne nyinaa mu no, na ɛyɛ tra kɛse.
This shouldn’t take much time.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi gye bere pii.
As many times as you want.	Mpɛn dodow a wopɛ.
This is not really a good time to bring him.	Eyi nyɛ bere pa ankasa sɛ wode no bɛba.
People think we have a chance to be very good.	Nkurɔfo susuw sɛ yɛwɔ hokwan sɛ yɛbɛyɛ papa yiye.
Over the years, perhaps.	Mfe pii mu no, ebia.
They will be about the same age.	Wɔn mfe bɛyɛ pɛ.
It’s easy to get things done.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ nneɛma.
I have one too.	Me nso mewɔ bi.
One thing is certain.	Ade biako na ɛyɛ nokware.
He doesn’t do anything.	Ɔnyɛ hwee.
You can’t follow them.	Worentumi nni wɔn akyi.
It should have a.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ a.
Give them to us.	Fa wɔn ma yɛn.
Two could, but not all three.	Ná baanu tumi, nanso ɛnyɛ abiɛsa no nyinaa.
He doesn’t like it.	N’ani nnye ho.
You have to give everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode biribiara ma.
You can never go wrong with this.	Worentumi nkɔ bɔne mu da wɔ eyi ho.
Every picture seems to tell a story.	Ɛte sɛ nea mfonini biara ka asɛm bi.
And this creates a problem.	Na eyi de ɔhaw ba.
This was going to happen.	Ná eyi bɛba.
Cold seems to make it quite easy.	Ɛte sɛ nea awɔw bɛyɛ no mmerɛw koraa.
I deal with these people every day.	Me ne saa nkurɔfo yi di nsɛm da biara da.
It can still do that.	Ɛda so ara betumi ayɛ saa.
I think my plan worked.	Misusuw sɛ me nhyehyɛe no yɛɛ adwuma.
Your mental capacity is really strong.	Wo adwene mu tumi no mu yɛ den ankasa.
Not usually.	Ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii no.
You like it, you use it.	W’ani gye ho, wode di dwuma.
And he certainly has.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wayɛ saa.
They were very nice to each other.	Wɔn ani gyee wɔn ho yiye.
He put his other hand on her arm.	Ɔde ne nsa foforo no bɔɔ ne nsa so.
And years of practice.	Na mfe pii a wɔde ayɛ adesua.
Hope it doesn’t matter.	Anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
Years later.	Mfe bi akyi.
Everyone is friends in the movie theater.	Obiara yɛ nnamfo wɔ sini dan no mu.
The movie is a lot of fun.	Sini no yɛ anigye kɛse.
My dad comes home late from work.	Me papa fi adwuma ba fie akyiri yi.
I’d really love it.	M’ani begye ho ankasa.
The dress is three years old.	Atade no adi mfe abiɛsa.
Or, more often, both.	Anaasɛ, mpɛn pii no, abien no nyinaa.
Just as it is.	Sɛnea ɛte no ara pɛ.
I'm sleeping.	Meyɛ nna.
I felt pretty amazing about it.	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye wɔ ho.
Not for the last few years though.	Ɛnyɛ mfe a etwa to no de.
Man, to be more good .	Onipa, sɛ wobɛyɛ papa kɛse .
It’s not just about the money.	Ɛnyɛ sika no nkutoo ho asɛm.
Say more with less.	Fa kakraa bi ka pii.
Anyway, he's always working.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɔreyɛ adwuma bere nyinaa.
But that doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛno mfa ho.
Put this on.	Fa eyi hyɛ.
I had surprised him.	Ná mayɛ no nwonwa.
And it has often worked out for me.	Na mpɛn pii no, ayɛ yiye ama me.
And yet he wasn’t.	Na nanso na ɔnyɛ saa.
I had never thought about it.	Ná minsusuw ho da.
It was a test for his life.	Ná ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ ma ne nkwa.
I used to create things with my hands.	Ná mede me nsa bɔ nneɛma.
And so was he, too.	Na ɔno nso te saa.
It’s a.	Ɛyɛ a.
He was interested in everything.	Ná n’ani gye biribiara ho.
First, you need to add more value.	Nea edi kan, ɛsɛ sɛ wode bo pii ka ho.
Pie you.	Pii sii.
Your sin is serious.	Bɔne a wobɛyɛ no yɛ kɛse.
And that’s not good either.	Na ɛno nso nyɛ papa.
See here for details.	Hwɛ ha ma nsɛm no mu nsɛm.
We can use it now.	Yebetumi de adi dwuma mprempren.
I would have done it.	Anka mɛyɛ no.
Those who work in industry can continue to do so.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ adwuma wɔ nnwuma mu no betumi akɔ so ayɛ saa.
You got me right.	Wo nyaa me yiye.
I wish he could just be there.	Me yam a anka obetumi aba hɔ ara kwa.
We were surprised by the popularity.	Yɛn ho dwiriw yɛn wɔ sɛnea nkurɔfo ani gye yɛn ho no ho.
He was self-conscious.	Ɔde ne ho too ne ho so.
I told you next week.	Meka kyerɛɛ wo dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
Hope you enjoyed it.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani gyee ho.
But look at the man.	Nanso hwɛ ɔbarima no.
It’s not perfect, but it’s the best.	Ɛnyɛ nea edi mũ, nanso ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
He could do this.	Ná obetumi ayɛ eyi.
I'm sitting on the floor.	Mete fam.
The first song is the first song on the list.	Dwom a edi kan ne dwom a edi kan wɔ din no mu.
Pick me up, if you must.	Fa me, sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ a.
And it doesn’t matter now anyway.	Na ɛnyɛ hwee mprempren ɔkwan biara so.
What a great job.	Adwuma kɛse bɛn ara ni.
It was a fascinating experience.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye.
Which is very old.	Nea akyɛ yiye.
This was a mistake.	Ná eyi yɛ mfomso.
The night of today.	Anadwo a ɛwɔ hɔ nnɛ.
We kind of got involved.	Yɛde yɛn ho hyɛɛ mu wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
There is also an external element.	Abɔnten so ade bi nso wɔ hɔ.
But he is none of those things.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara.
Your profile is a feast.	Wo ho nsɛm no yɛ apontow bi.
He has to end it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ba awiei.
There was nothing complicated about him.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ den wɔ ne ho.
I did that.	Meyɛɛ saa.
That was one way.	Ná ɛno yɛ ɔkwan biako.
I still don’t understand.	Meda so ara nte ase.
Their own meeting, it seemed.	Wɔn ankasa nhyiam, na ɛte sɛ.
I can't seem to figure it out though.	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nsusuw ho nanso.
It was the same as before.	Ná ɛte sɛ kan no ara pɛ.
First, they are interconnected in a strange way.	Nea edi kan no, wɔde wɔn ho abɔ mu wɔ ɔkwan bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
Yes, she is beautiful.	Ampa, ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He pointed to the door.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ ɔpon no so.
I think they are beautiful.	Misusuw sɛ wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
I'll go with you.	Me ne wo bɛkɔ.
This language is not common.	Saa kasa yi nyɛ nea nnipa pii nka.
I loved parties.	Ná m’ani gye apontow ahorow ho.
It also needs to be worked on, but do we? 	Ɛho hia sɛ wɔyɛ ho adwuma nso, nanso yɛyɛ saa?
It is a one-year course.	Ɛyɛ afe biako adesua.
The last point in that story proves to be false.	Asɛm a etwa to wɔ saa asɛm no mu no kyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ atoro.
His mother seems to think .	Ɛte sɛ nea ne maame susuw sɛ .
We are a good team.	Yɛyɛ kuw pa.
Operators need to be careful with their work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn a wɔde kar di dwuma no hwɛ wɔn adwuma yiye.
My hand in danger.	Me nsa a mede ka asiane ho.
However, last year didn’t work.	Nanso, afe a etwaam no anyɛ adwuma.
But at the end of the day, people live here.	Nanso ɛda no awiei no, nkurɔfo te ha.
But it looks interesting so far.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye de besi nnɛ.
It has to be that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
This has always been a challenge for me.	Eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ den ma me bere nyinaa.
But maybe not in the next or the next.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ nea edi hɔ no mu anaasɛ nea edi hɔ no mu.
However, one person was missing.	Nanso, na onipa biako nni hɔ.
He should have done it himself.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa yɛ.
They talk about their day.	Wɔka wɔn da no ho asɛm.
It has worked very well so far, and is used daily.	Ayɛ adwuma yiye paa de besi nnɛ, na wɔde di dwuma da biara da.
Get used to the idea.	Fa adwene no yɛ wo su.
He brushed his hair out of his eyes.	Ɔde ne ti nhwi fii n’ani so.
He's always on me too.	Ɔyɛ bere nyinaa wɔ me so nso.
Something like that must have happened.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ biribi a ɛte saa sii.
Fortunately, the plan never materialized.	Nea eye ne sɛ, nhyehyɛe no antumi amma mu da.
If you can do it.	Sɛ wubetumi a.
It is located at the bottom of this method.	Ɛwɔ saa ɔkwan yi ase.
You see what really matters.	Wuhu nea ɛho hia ankasa.
But he doesn’t.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa.
One of the last projects.	Nnwuma a etwa to no mu biako.
Tell you what is there.	Ka nea ɛwɔ hɔ kyerɛ wo.
He leaned his head against the table.	Ɔde ne ti too pon no so.
He was never big on friends.	Ná ɔnyɛ kɛse wɔ nnamfo ho da.
Do everything in his name.	Yɛ biribiara wɔ ne din mu.
Someone knew about the money.	Ná obi nim sika no ho asɛm.
There is no music.	Nnwom biara nni hɔ.
This is the first real test.	Eyi ne sɔhwɛ ankasa a edi kan.
He was a little shocked, but not that surprised.	Ne ho dwiriw no kakra, nanso ɛnyɛ ne ho dwiriw no saa.
Keep going, hot stuff.	Kɔ so, nneɛma a ɛyɛ hyew.
I wanted to do it tonight.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ no anadwo yi.
He didn't want to talk about his test.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka ne sɔhwɛ no ho asɛm.
This is a mistake.	Eyi yɛ mfomso.
But behold, a word is at work in you.	Nanso hwɛ, asɛm bi yɛ adwuma wɔ wo mu.
He wants to tell them.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ wɔn.
A new year.	Afe foforo.
She never really knew him.	Ná onnim no ankasa da.
I'm not sure if any of these things are real.	Me nnim sɛ saa nneɛma yi mu biara ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
The two of them started for the city.	Wɔn baanu fii ase kɔɔ kurow no mu.
I want to see if he can do well.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛ ebia obetumi ayɛ yiye anaa.
And you are in it.	Na wowɔ mu.
Things will get better next week.	Nneɛma bɛyɛ yiye dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
Nothing was ever not like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na ɛnte saa da.
There are no people.	Nnipa biara nni hɔ.
Your capital is at risk if you invest.	Wo sika kɛse no wɔ asiane mu sɛ wode sika hyɛ mu a.
And maybe we can do that.	Na ebia yebetumi ayɛ saa.
He wasn’t interested.	Ná n’ani nnye ho.
That’s a fact.	Ɛno yɛ nokware.
Part of it is time.	Ne fã bi ne bere.
I’m still interested in everything.	M’ani da so ara ani gye biribiara ho.
I love hanging out with them.	M’ani gye ho sɛ me ne wɔn bɛbɔ.
He might be the only one interested.	Ebia ɔno nkutoo na n’ani begye ho.
The movie was going to be awesome.	Ná sini no bɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
He is strong.	Ɔyɛ den.
Again, this was part of the plan.	Bio nso, na eyi yɛ nhyehyɛe no fã.
But there was obviously someone in the house.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ na obi wɔ fie hɔ.
I believe it is true.	Migye di sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
Perhaps you are one of them.	Ebia woyɛ wɔn mu biako.
But we have an idea.	Nanso yɛwɔ adwene bi.
The meal would take time.	Ná aduan no begye bere.
Anything but practice.	Biribiara gye sɛ wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu.
Go to the bedroom.	Kɔ mpa no so.
They make it work.	Wɔyɛ no adwuma.
Look at it from their perspective.	Hwɛ no wɔ wɔn adwene mu.
I was only there for three days.	Ná mewɔ hɔ nnansa pɛ.
This story has a happy ending.	Saa asɛm yi wɔ awiei a ɛyɛ anigye.
Invest in yourself.	Fa sika hyɛ wo mu.
This is not as surprising as it may seem.	Eyi nyɛ nwonwa sɛnea ebia ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛte no.
He can have this as a mistake he shouldn’t have made.	Obetumi anya eyi sɛ mfomso a anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I didn’t know his name.	Ná minnim ne din.
Not too realistic.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware dodo.
Each of us has a story.	Yɛn mu biara wɔ asɛm bi.
And look again.	Na hwɛ bio.
We all think of each other.	Yɛn nyinaa susuw yɛn ho yɛn ho ho.
I am a man.	Meyɛ ɔbarima.
I pointed to him.	Mede me nsa kyerɛɛ no ​​so.
I can tell it’s him even from the outside.	Metumi ahu sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno mpo fi akyi.
It’s a thrill	Ɛyɛ anigye
You can see the first one here.	Wubetumi ahu nea edi kan no wɔ ha.
The meeting was very lively and packed.	Ná nhyiam no yɛ hyew yiye na na nnipa ahyɛ hɔ ma.
He knew exactly what he wanted.	Ná onim nea ɔpɛ no yiye.
Never follow someone home.	Mma obi nni obi akyi nkɔ fie da.
He drove to the pavement.	Ɔde kar no kɔɔ ɔkwan a wɔde fa so no so.
This made things easier.	Eyi maa nneɛma yɛɛ mmerɛw.
He was one of my favorite characters at that point.	Ná ɔyɛ nnipa a m’ani gye wɔn ho paa no mu biako wɔ saa bere no mu.
She's really bright.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hyew ankasa.
We were all scared.	Ná yɛn nyinaa suro.
Or you.	Anaasɛ wo.
It must have been much larger, the monster.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ kɛse kɛse, aboa kɛse no.
The party started later.	Apontow no fii ase akyiri yi.
They do that.	Wɔyɛ saa.
This was exciting.	Ná eyi yɛ anigye.
No one can see it.	Obiara ntumi nhu.
Don’t let anyone know you’re here.	Mma obiara nhu sɛ wowɔ ha.
It’s still warm outside.	Ɛda so ara yɛ hyew wɔ abɔnten.
A police team had arrived at the scene	Ná polisifo kuw bi aba baabi a asɛm no sii no
It was a car accident.	Na ɛyɛ kar akwanhyia.
Those who describe him said little to him.	Wɔn a wɔka ne ho asɛm no anka kakraa bi ankyerɛ no.
We can consider ourselves truly happy.	Yebetumi abu yɛn ho sɛ yɛwɔ anigye ankasa.
They have to do me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ me.
I find them really intense.	Mihu sɛ wɔn mu yɛ den ankasa.
He thinks about it.	Osusuw ho.
It seemed to be another test.	Ɛte sɛ nea na ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ foforo.
It’s not a thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade.
Cars are great.	Kar ahorow yɛ kɛse.
We can be happy again.	Yebetumi anya anigye bio.
I tell myself that every morning.	Meka saa kyerɛ me ho anɔpa biara.
Would he ever be able to do that.	So anka obetumi ayɛ saa da bi.
I was unfamiliar with both.	Ná minnim abien no nyinaa yiye.
He was just a kid.	Na ɔyɛ abofra ara kwa.
Very happy with me.	Anigye kɛse wɔ me ho.
I am a man.	Meyɛ ɔbarima.
He knew the car was at my house.	Ná onim sɛ kar no wɔ me fie.
I know my wife doesn’t feel that way.	Minim sɛ me yere nte nka saa.
This was a surprise to me.	Ná eyi yɛɛ me nwonwa.
And it doesn’t matter what you do.	Na nea woyɛ no mfa ho.
I just used my stuff.	Mede me nneɛma dii dwuma ara kwa.
That one is amazing.	Saa biako no yɛ nwonwa.
It really does.	Ɛyɛ saa ankasa.
There is only one way.	Ɔkwan biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I understand this was the case.	Mete ase sɛ na eyi te saa.
He had to be a part of it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ne fã.
It’s not just here.	Ɛnyɛ ha nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
He also liked his name.	N’ani gyee ne din nso ho.
And we can talk about that a little bit.	Na yebetumi aka saa asɛm no ho asɛm kakra.
What he knows, he knows.	Nea onim no, onim.
How it felt to have legs.	Sɛnea na ɛte sɛ nea wowɔ nan.
No city is my home anymore.	Kurow biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ me fie bio.
And he was the only one.	Na ne nkutoo.
The meeting is taking place today.	Nhyiam no rekɔ so nnɛ.
But he himself knew nothing about it.	Nanso na ɔno ankasa nnim ho hwee.
Maybe it shouldn’t be.	Ebia ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
This is a living document.	Eyi yɛ krataa a ɛte ase.
Or what it was supposed to do for you.	Anaasɛ nea na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ma wo.
People need to be careful about their identities.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo hwɛ yiye wɔ wɔn ho nsɛm ho.
There would be enough time for that later.	Ná bere a ɛdɔɔso bɛba ama ɛno akyiri yi.
It was beautiful out there.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
He was such a cute kid.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra a ne ho yɛ fɛ saa.
I have a weird problem.	Mewɔ ɔhaw bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
They took their packages home.	Wɔde wɔn nneɛma a wɔde ahyɛ mu no kɔɔ fie.
Remember, it is very, very cold out there.	Kae sɛ, awɔw wom yiye, kɛse wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
They seemed an unlikely pair.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ baanu a ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
It felt like nothing.	Ná ɛte nka sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
They were very strong.	Ná wɔyɛ den yiye.
I should have known better.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu yiye.
This was last month.	Ná eyi yɛ ɔsram a etwaam no.
The police are there now.	Polisifo no wɔ hɔ mprempren.
My real father and I never do.	Me ne me papa ankasa nyɛ saa da.
He panics, but not in a terrifying way.	Ɔbɔ hu, nanso ɛnyɛ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu so.
The plan itself was anything but brilliant.	Ná nhyehyɛe no ankasa yɛ biribiara gye sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He says now is not a good time.	Ɔka sɛ mprempren nyɛ bere pa.
Get involved as much as you can.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu sɛnea wubetumi biara.
This causes him pain.	Eyi ma ɔte yaw.
Just look at it.	Hwɛ no ara kwa.
Where does all this fruit keep coming from?	Ɛhe na saa aba yi nyinaa kɔ so fi?
He was a strong man.	Ná ne ho yɛ den.
It was about the water.	Ná ɛyɛ nsu no ho ade.
However, I enjoyed it.	Nanso, m’ani gyee ho.
Remember, it’s something he has to do.	Kae sɛ ɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
He was a happy man.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔwɔ anigye.
Within a week, they were a product.	Wɔ dapɛn biako mu no, na wɔyɛ ade bi.
Or even a month.	Anaasɛ ɔsram biako mpo.
His path was clear.	Ná ne kwan no mu da hɔ.
The new one is old.	Foforo no yɛ dedaw.
It seems strange to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ma me.
Hours of travel are required.	Ɛho hia sɛ wɔde nnɔnhwerew pii tu kwan.
Not too surprising, that.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa kɛse, ɛno.
It seems strange that these things have actually happened.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ saa nneɛma yi asi ankasa.
Nobody saw it.	Obiara anhu.
He was interested in that.	Ná n’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
He didn't even know why.	Ná onnim nea enti a wayɛ saa mpo.
He didn’t have anything like that.	Ná onni biribi a ɛte saa.
The plan was retrospective.	Ná nhyehyɛe no yɛ nea wɔde hwɛ asɛm no akyi.
It was a wonderful night.	Na ɛyɛ anadwo a ɛyɛ anigye.
This sounds like an interesting problem.	Eyi te sɛ ɔhaw a ɛyɛ anigye.
I can do that, you know.	Metumi ayɛ saa, wunim.
And it was indeed.	Na ɛte saa ampa.
Everyone was worried about them.	Ná obiara haw wɔn ho.
Very good stuff.	Nneɛma a eye paa.
Think about things.	Susuw nneɛma ho hwɛ.
People are often reluctant to give out personal information.	Mpɛn pii no, nkurɔfo mpɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn ho nsɛm bɛma.
Anyone can bring those.	Obiara betumi de saa nneɛma no aba.
It was winter, and the cold was wet.	Ná ɛyɛ awɔw bere, na na awɔw no yɛ nsu.
I want to know what they do.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea wɔyɛ.
No one really believes it.	Obiara nnye nni ankasa.
You’re the one in it.	Wo na ɛwɔ mu.
Everyone was shocked.	Obiara ho dwiriw no.
The road is jammed with traffic.	Kar ahyɛ kwan no so.
There is someone else you need to know.	Obi foforo wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no.
I couldn’t do that.	Na mintumi nyɛ saa.
The evening was a success.	Anwummere no yɛɛ yiye.
You can take good care of yourself.	Wubetumi ahwɛ wo ho yiye.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɛyɛ bere ho asɛm ara kwa.
Not often, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii, ɔkwan biara so.
But this was still beautiful.	Nanso na eyi da so ara yɛ fɛ.
This surprised us.	Eyi yɛɛ yɛn nwonwa.
And this has two consequences.	Na eyi de nneɛma abien fi mu ba.
See if this works for you.	Hwɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma ma wo anaa.
That’s what’s going on.	Ɛno ne nea ɛrekɔ so.
He became very weak.	Ɔyɛɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
But the words were not there.	Nanso na nsɛm no nni hɔ.
It is incredibly difficult.	Ɛyɛ den ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He’s such a good, good boy .	Ɔyɛ abarimaa pa, abarimaa pa a ɔte saa .
If anything you.	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a wo.
It was a difficult target.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ den sɛ wɔde wɔn ani besi so.
Everything was great.	Ná biribiara yɛ kɛse.
I will even take you there.	Mede wo bɛkɔ hɔ mpo.
It was a reason but not the only one.	Na ɛyɛ biribi a enti nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo.
He has made himself so.	Wayɛ ne ho saa.
It wasn’t a road.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɔkwan bi.
This is done every year.	Wɔyɛ eyi afe biara.
No one can do that anymore.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ saa bio.
As it is, it is.	Sɛnea ɛte no.
Their only word we have is that there was one.	Wɔn asɛm nkutoo na yɛwɔ sɛ na biako wɔ hɔ.
The lyrics of the song.	Dwom no mu nsɛm.
It was very difficult for me.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma me paa.
Interesting but challenging.	Anigye nanso ɛyɛ den.
That is not really true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware ankasa.
It was a lot of work.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma pii.
That’s pretty amazing.	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa yiye.
She was really beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
There is no reason to do it here.	Biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wɔ ha.
This was the last one.	Ná eyi ne nea etwa to no.
We hope people like it .	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ nkurɔfo ani begye ho .
In the meantime, tell me what you know about him.	Saa bere yi nyinaa, ka nea wunim fa ne ho kyerɛ me.
There is nothing else in town.	Biribiara foforo biara nni kurow no mu.
This man just did something to her.	Saa ɔbarima yi yɛɛ no ​​biribi kɛkɛ.
This city is	Saa kurow yi ne
My idea really worked.	M’adwene no yɛɛ adwuma ankasa.
I wish you well.	Mepɛ sɛ wo yiye.
It’s quite complicated.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den koraa.
I really like that.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho ankasa.
You must come with me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne me ba.
They are old friends and true friends.	Wɔyɛ nnamfo dedaw ne nokware nnamfo.
I think you know him.	Misusuw sɛ wunim no.
But it’s like.	Nanso ɛte sɛ.
Or maybe both.	Anaasɛ ebia abien no nyinaa.
The experiment had been successful.	Ná sɔhwɛ no ayɛ yiye.
Which was far better for me, obviously.	Nea na eye koraa ma me, ɛda adi sɛ.
The point is clear.	Asɛm no mu da hɔ.
He wanted paintings outside.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ wɔyɛ mfonini ahorow wɔ abɔnten.
He concluded that it was not.	Ɔde baa awiei sɛ ɛnte saa.
It’s a different time now.	Ɛyɛ bere foforo mprempren.
Now more, even more so.	Mprempren pii, sen saa mpo.
That wasn’t so bad.	Ná ɛno nyɛ bɔne saa.
There were good people and bad people.	Na nnipa pa ne nnipa bɔne wɔ hɔ.
We were headed for danger.	Ná yɛde yɛn ani kyerɛ asiane bi mu.
And we will work until you are well still.	Na yɛbɛyɛ adwuma kosi sɛ wo ho bɛyɛ den da so ara.
I had to go outside.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ abɔnten.
It was in the bedroom.	Na ɛwɔ mpa no mu.
That was all he cared about.	Ɛno nkutoo ne nea na ɛho hia no.
Sure, the car is there.	Ampa, kar no wɔ hɔ.
The man landed on his feet.	Ɔbarima no sii fam wɔ ne nan so.
It is very complex and expensive.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den yiye na ne bo yɛ den.
Do this well.	Yɛ eyi yiye.
It was an exciting time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ anigye.
Maybe all will be well this time.	Ebia ne nyinaa bɛkɔ yiye saa bere yi.
We drove for a day and a half.	Yɛde kar no da koro ne fã.
And it’s your movie, it’s good.	Na ɛyɛ wo sini no, ɛyɛ papa.
What this was there is no doubt about it.	Nea na eyi yɛ akyinnye biara nni ho.
And maybe he might.	Na ebia ebia ɔbɛyɛ saa.
His name is still there.	Ne din da so ara wɔ hɔ.
That house has too much stuff.	Saa fie no wɔ nneɛma pii dodo.
A difficult thing.	Ade a ɛyɛ den.
It was a large classroom.	Ná ɛyɛ adesua dan kɛse bi.
Just bad risk management.	Asiane ho nhyehyɛe bɔne ara kwa.
However, the bigger problem is clearly not what you think.	Nanso, ɛda adi sɛ ɔhaw kɛse no nyɛ nea wususuw sɛ ɛte no.
The city was very crowded.	Ná kurow no mu ayɛ ma kɛse.
It’s as simple as telling someone a story.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ asɛm bi a wobɛka akyerɛ obi.
Make yourself at home.	Yɛ wo ho sɛ wowɔ fie.
In just three days.	Wɔ nnansa pɛ mu.
However, that is also a problem.	Nanso, ɛno nso yɛ ɔhaw.
This is completely wrong.	Eyi yɛ mfomso koraa.
What he didn’t know was why.	Nea na onnim ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
The results are often positive.	Nneɛma pa taa fi mu ba.
At least for the time being.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ saa bere yi mu.
I am not a nice person.	Menyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It didn’t seem to matter.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia.
Each team had a task to perform.	Ná kuw biara wɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
No one knows why.	Obiara nnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
He seems to be alone in this view.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ saa adwene yi mu.
He is at home with his wife.	Ɔne ne yere wɔ fie.
It was a terrifying thought.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ hu.
He knew this but it didn’t help somehow.	Na onim eyi nanso ɛnyɛ mmoa ɔkwan bi so.
I never wanted to have to tell anyone.	Ná mempɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ obiara da.
Two other officers had arrived in another police car.	Ná polisifo baanu foforo de polisifo kar foforo aba hɔ.
Test results are what you think they are.	Sɔhwɛ mu aba ne nea wususuw sɛ ɛte.
With very few exceptions.	Gye sɛ kakraa bi pɛ.
I was whole.	Ná meyɛ mũ.
And jobs will tell you that at the end of the day.	Na nnwuma bɛka akyerɛ wo saa wɔ da no awiei.
I'll just give the details.	Mede nsɛm no mu nsɛm bɛma kɛkɛ.
He does this a lot.	Ɔyɛ saa ade yi pii.
This was my absolute favorite.	Ná eyi ne nea m’ani gye ho koraa.
However, no one does.	Nanso, obiara nyɛ saa.
He just wanted to talk to her.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne no kasa nkutoo.
However, this point just didn’t matter.	Nanso, na saa asɛm yi ho nhia ara kwa.
Everyone had problems.	Ná obiara wɔ ɔhaw ahorow.
He is not good enough.	Ɔnyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
You have to give him one.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode biako ma no.
Everyone knew that.	Ná obiara nim saa.
The last thing.	Ade a etwa to no.
He is just there for me.	Ɔwɔ hɔ ara ma me.
Not that it was because of him.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ ɔno nti.
You knew it well.	Ná wunim yiye.
You know his situation.	Wunim ne tebea no.
Thank you for the wonderful things.	Da wo ase wɔ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa no ho.
My words were there.	Na me nsɛm no wɔ hɔ.
To be the best movie you can make.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ sini a eye sen biara a wubetumi ayɛ no.
It’s the first story again.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a edi kan bio.
The results have been good.	Nea afi mu aba no ayɛ papa.
Food is terrible.	Aduan yɛ hu.
He owed them a lot.	Ná ɔde wɔn ka kɛse.
But this is still very early days.	Nanso eyi da so ara yɛ nna a edi kan koraa.
No doubt you know something about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wunim ho hwee.
Life.	Nkwa.
My kids really enjoyed it.	Me mma ani gyee ho ankasa.
The year ends and the new one begins.	Afe no ba awiei na foforo no fi ase.
I just didn't know how or why.	Ná minnim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ anaa nea enti a ɛte saa ara kwa.
One would have said he was surprised.	Anka obi nso bɛka sɛ ne ho dwiriw no.
It might be too big for him.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ kɛse dodo ama no.
People tend to forget that.	Nkurɔfo werɛ taa fi saa asɛm no.
They no longer enjoy the things we no longer enjoy.	Wɔn ani nnye nneɛma a yɛn ani nnye ho bio no ho bio.
And we have to do something about your name.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ wo din ho biribi.
But it works just as well.	Nanso ɛyɛ adwuma yiye saa ara.
It’s a bad month.	Ɛyɛ ɔsram bɔne.
He is not alone.	Ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
No job for you there.	Adwuma biara nni hɔ mma wo wɔ hɔ.
There is another one of us.	Yɛn mu foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
It’s going downhill.	Ɛrekɔ fam.
You are just perfect.	Woyɛ pɛ ara kwa.
Maybe it’s not just the money.	Ebia ɛnyɛ sika no nkutoo.
I was just a man.	Ná meyɛ ɔbarima ara kwa.
He can definitely do well.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ obetumi ayɛ yiye.
I joined them.	Mede me ho bɔɔ wɔn.
He'll go with you if you want.	Ɔne wo bɛkɔ sɛ wopɛ a.
They love books and music.	Wɔn ani gye nhoma ne nnwom ho.
He wants you to believe him.	Ɔpɛ sɛ wugye no di.
But that is not how things work.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na nneɛma kɔ so.
It was beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani gyee ho paa.
This is something no one wants to do.	Eyi yɛ biribi a obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ.
We both should have done for a few days.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛ ade nna kakraa bi.
You are beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ.
I knew it was cold.	Ná minim sɛ awɔw wom.
I know that it is.	Minim sɛ ɛte saa.
The kids were late for school.	Ná mmofra no aka akyi wɔ sukuu mu.
There are also dangers.	Asiane ahorow nso wɔ hɔ.
However, it is still difficult.	Nanso, ɛda so ara yɛ den.
That’s all there is to it.	Ɛno na ɛwɔ hɔ ara.
He did indeed do so.	Ɔyɛɛ saa ampa.
There is a snake right there.	Ɔwɔ bi wɔ hɔ ara.
It’s like a game.	Ɛte sɛ agoru bi.
This time there was no such opportunity.	Saa bere yi de na hokwan a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ.
But maybe that was my fault.	Nanso ebia na ɛno ne me mfomso.
So was his, by the way.	Saa ara na na ne de nso te, ɔkwan bi so no.
He knew what he had to do.	Ná onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I think you will do that.	Misusuw sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
Maybe my wife.	Ebia me yere.
Always on his terms.	Bere nyinaa wɔ ne nsɛm so.
The car is still intact.	Kar no da so ara yɛ nea ɛte.
However, this is not a perfect approach.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ ɔkwan a edi mũ.
Her legs made her legs bigger.	Ne nan no maa ne nan yɛɛ kɛse.
They love it down here.	Wɔn ani gye ho wɔ ha fam.
Enjoy the convention this weekend.	Momma mo ani nnye nhyiam no ase dapɛn awiei yi.
So few people cycle there.	Enti nnipa kakraa bi na wɔde sakre kɔ hɔ.
But most of them do.	Nanso wɔn mu dodow no ara yɛ saa.
But, one day, it will.	Nanso, da bi, ɛbɛyɛ saa.
He ran outside.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ abɔnten.
The house is old but very nice.	Ofie no ayɛ dedaw nanso ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
It didn’t matter to me.	Ná ɛnyɛ me asɛm.
He knew this, as if his days had told him of it.	Ná onim eyi, te sɛ nea ne nna no aka ho asɛm akyerɛ no.
You can see everything from there.	Wubetumi afi hɔ ahu biribiara.
It should have been easy.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
It is located under the surface of the back.	Ɛwɔ akyi no ani ase.
He knew his wife's first name.	Ná onim ne yere din a edi kan.
I expected it to be fine.	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
He just told you to take care of yourself.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ wo ara sɛ hwɛ wo yiye.
You can’t help yourself.	Worentumi mmoa wo ho.
Maybe he just gave us to each other.	Ebia ɔde yɛn maa yɛn ho yɛn ho ara kwa.
It is unclear whether this claim is actually true.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛda adi sɛ ebia saa asɛm yi yɛ nokware ankasa anaa.
Animals cannot do this.	Mmoa ntumi nyɛ eyi.
It could easily be me too.	Ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ me nso.
It wasn’t that I couldn’t work.	Ná ɛnyɛ sɛ mintumi nyɛ adwuma.
This was just busy work anyway.	Ná eyi yɛ adwuma a adagyew nnim ara kwa ɔkwan biara so.
How much money do you accept?	Sika dodow ahe na wugye tom?
But this is far from common.	Nanso eyi nyɛ nea abu so koraa.
That surprised him a little.	Ɛno yɛɛ no ​​nwonwa kakra.
And there are many more.	Na pii nso wɔ hɔ.
As long as you tell him.	Bere tenten a wobɛka akyerɛ no no.
The girl leaned her head against the table.	Abeawa no de ne ti too pon no so.
He wanted that power, too.	Ná ɔpɛ saa tumi no, nso.
Everyone has a lot of both.	Nneɛma abien no nyinaa pii wɔ obiara mu.
I have worked with him.	Me ne no ayɛ adwuma.
We could only be so happy.	Ná yebetumi anya anigye saa nkutoo.
What a lovely girl.	Abeawa a n’ani gye ho bɛn ara ni.
He does the same thing.	Ɔno nso yɛ saa.
Not many chapters.	Ɛnyɛ ti pii.
I’m interested in sex.	M’ani gye nna ho.
He does it every year.	Ɔyɛ no afe biara.
She was really beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
I have no idea what to say.	Minni nea mɛka ho adwene biara.
I had no idea what the thing was.	Ná minnim nea ade no yɛ.
That would be interesting indeed.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye ampa.
I just can’t imagine it.	Mintumi nsusuw ho kɛkɛ.
He knows everything.	Onim biribiara.
Get out of the way.	Fi kwan no so.
It’s a thrill	Ɛyɛ anigye
Where he is when he is not with you.	Baabi a ɔwɔ bere a ɔne wo nni hɔ no.
My mother went there.	Me maame kɔɔ hɔ.
So we can do better.	Enti yebetumi ayɛ papa.
And there’s still plenty of time for more.	Na bere pii da so ara wɔ hɔ ma pii.
Efficient use of power.	Tumi a wɔde di dwuma yiye.
It was just as difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den saa ara.
Many of you probably do too.	Ebia mo mu pii nso yɛ saa.
This time, it didn’t work out so well.	Saa bere yi de, ankɔ yiye saa.
Your plans are outdated.	Wo nhyehyɛe ahorow no ne bere atwam.
It is not a complicated complexity.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ den a ɛyɛ den.
He did the same thing.	Ɔno nso yɛɛ saa.
The reason for this is unclear.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no mu nna hɔ.
That goes for this song.	Ɛno kɔ ma dwom yi.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Biribiara nni hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
That dress was amazing.	Ná saa atade no yɛ nwonwa.
They use that.	Wɔde saa na edi dwuma.
That would be a lie.	Ɛno bɛyɛ atoro bi.
Who only wants to play with me.	Nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne me di agoru nkutoo.
I did it in vain.	Meyɛɛ no ​​kwa.
Everything but this one.	Biribiara gye eyi.
She hoped she could do the same for her children.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ obetumi ayɛ saa ara ama ne mma.
There are not many exceptions.	Nsɛm pii nni hɔ a ɛnte saa.
But this is the number we have now.	Nanso eyi ne dodow a yɛwɔ mprempren.
But for him, it had to be true.	Nanso wɔ ne fam no, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
I hope you are doing well.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ woreyɛ yiye.
Which was really good for me.	Nea na eye ma me ankasa.
You don’t have to remember anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wokae biribiara.
If they are involved, great.	Sɛ wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu a, kɛse.
And this is it.	Na eyi ne no.
At least for me it is.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ me fam no, ɛte saa.
The food was modest, but filling.	Ná aduan no yɛ nea ɛho nhia pii, nanso na ɛyɛ ma.
I believe in myself more.	Migye me ho di kɛse.
And just look at how no one gives this any thought.	Na hwɛ sɛnea obiara mma eyi ho adwene biara kɛkɛ.
It sounds like you two have been busy.	Ɛte sɛ nea mo baanu anya adagyew.
Maybe it has been.	Ebia na ayɛ saa.
Nothing but money.	Biribiara nni hɔ gye sika.
That would sound terrible to me .	Ɛno bɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu ama me .
He has independent power.	Ɔwɔ tumi a ɔde ne ho.
Many people were involved in that house.	Ná nnipa pii de wɔn ho hyɛɛ saa ofie no mu.
Grab them immediately and act immediately.	Fa wɔn ntɛm ara na yɛ ho biribi ntɛm ara.
But not in a happy way.	Nanso ɛnyɛ anigye kwan so.
That in itself was nothing new.	Ná ɛno ankasa nyɛ ade foforo.
So it’s hard.	Enti ɛyɛ den.
My children, too.	Me mma nso.
Look at the work.	Hwɛ adwuma no.
This way, he would be strong.	Saa kwan yi so no, na ne ho bɛyɛ den.
And so will tomorrow.	Na saa ara na ɔkyena nso bɛyɛ.
And he gave it to the man.	Na ɔno nso maa ɔbarima no.
It was an accident anyway.	Na ɛyɛ akwanhyia ɔkwan biara so.
We brought each other down.	Yɛde yɛn ho yɛn ho baa fam.
I’m the one who owns it.	Me na mewɔ bi.
The food went a long way, but the group had fun.	Aduan no kɔɔ akyiri, nanso kuw no gyee wɔn ani.
I can’t tell you anything.	Mintumi nka hwee nkyerɛ wo.
There was absolutely no idea of ​​the truth.	Na nokware no ho adwene biara nni hɔ koraa.
Keep the story down.	Ma asɛm no nkɔ fam.
This is a great opportunity.	Eyi yɛ hokwan kɛse.
But my child is in danger.	Nanso me ba no wɔ asiane mu.
The food was amazing.	Ná aduan no yɛ nwonwa.
It sounds like you have multiple plans.	Ɛte sɛ nea wowɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow pii.
Of this, there is no doubt.	Eyi ho no, akyinnye biara nni ho.
Nothing he does is good for him.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ a eye ma no.
But he wanted them to.	Nanso na ɔpɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
But not in this way.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa kwan yi so.
But he was there.	Nanso na ɔwɔ hɔ.
It was terrible.	Ná ɛyɛ hu.
He patted the dog on the head.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ɔkraman no ti so.
So we were completely on our own.	Enti na yɛwɔ yɛn ankasa ho koraa.
Look at those things.	Hwɛ saa nneɛma no.
I didn’t like much.	Ná m’ani nnye pii ho.
Just fill it up.	Fa hyɛ mu ma kɛkɛ.
Many users can access it.	Nnipa pii a wɔde di dwuma no betumi anya bi.
He’s a cute boy, he is.	Ɔyɛ abarimaa a ne ho yɛ fɛ, ɔyɛ.
It’s good on everything.	Ɛyɛ papa wɔ biribiara so.
But it’s not just a story.	Nanso ɛnyɛ asɛm biara kɛkɛ.
Tell him whatever you need to tell him.	Ka biribiara a ɛsɛ sɛ woka kyerɛ no.
We have been using both for a long time.	Yɛde abien no nyinaa adi dwuma bere tenten ni.
But no one was supposed to know that.	Nanso na ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara hu saa.
He didn’t have much time.	Ná onni bere pii.
This city is interesting, interesting.	Saa kurow yi yɛ anigye, ɛyɛ anigye.
It’s not how it works anymore.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma bio.
When he was gone he was working.	Bere a na onni hɔ no na ɔreyɛ adwuma.
And it wasn’t.	Na ɛnyɛ saa.
But it’s not your problem.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wo haw.
I think he’s doing a pretty good job.	Misusuw sɛ ɔreyɛ adwuma pa ara.
Think of it as a surprise.	Fa no sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It’s too big	Ɛyɛ kɛse dodo
They are all the same to me.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ pɛ ma me.
But the money wasn’t necessary.	Nanso na sika no ho nhia.
Stories make people happy and hurt.	Nsɛm ma nkurɔfo ani gye na ɛyɛ yaw.
It seems to be the case.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
He has to get used to the idea.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde adwene no yɛ ne su.
The winter makes me happy too.	Awɔw bere no ma m’ani gye nso.
But he had to do more of that.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa pii.
I couldn’t allow myself to think about him.	Na mintumi mma me ho kwan mma minsusuw ne ho.
I wanted to stay strong for him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ den ma no.
That should make them louder.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ma wɔn ano yɛ den.
This bed is too low.	Saa mpa yi ba fam dodo.
Imagine if that was never necessary.	Susuw ho hwɛ sɛ na ɛno ho nhia da a.
If you have to do that.	Sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa a.
He looked like the first one.	Ná ɔte sɛ nea edi kan no.
It’s nothing like that.	Ɛnyɛ hwee sɛ ɛno.
It was just too real.	Ná ɛyɛ nokware dodo ara kwa.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I want to take my wife.	Mepɛ sɛ mede me yere kɔ.
Look at me!	Hwɛ me!
There was just so much money in it.	Ná sika pii wɔ mu ara kwa.
You don’t want to be bad.	Wompɛ sɛ woyɛ bɔne.
There was nothing we could do anyway.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ ɔkwan biara so.
He couldn’t do it himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa ntumi nyɛ.
And he knew who they were.	Na na onim wɔn a wɔyɛ.
Everyone had to be in that play-by-play.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ obiara wɔ saa agoru a wɔde di agoru no mu.
She is a wonderful girl.	Ɔyɛ abeawa a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
What a good idea.	Adwene pa bɛn ara ni.
Everyone looked at him intently.	Obiara hwɛɛ no ​​denneennen.
I wasn’t doing that.	Ná menyɛ saa.
And that’s not because it’s easy.	Na ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw nti na ɛte saa.
At the end of the hallway was a door.	Ná ɔpon bi wɔ ɔkwan no awiei koraa.
The right way.	Ɔkwan pa.
It’s truly amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ampa.
Not in my name!.	Ɛnyɛ me din mu!.
And so did I.	Na me nso.
Give me everything.	Ma me biribiara.
More on that soon.	Ɛno ho nsɛm pii bɛba nnansa yi ara.
Everything in the details.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ nsɛm no mu.
That does no good for anyone, any of us.	Ɛno nyɛ papa biara mma obiara, yɛn mu biara.
However, it is how he feels.	Nanso, ɛyɛ sɛnea ɔte nka.
I actually do the same thing.	Me nso meyɛ saa ara ankasa.
Finally, it was me.	Awiei koraa no, na ɛyɛ me.
Put on warm clothes immediately.	Hyɛ ntade a ɛyɛ hyew ntɛm ara.
However, he was warm about the matter.	Nanso, ne ho yɛɛ no ​​hyew wɔ asɛm no ho.
There is still much work to be done.	Adwuma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I have no plans.	Minni nhyehyɛe biara.
And it still hurts.	Na ɛda so ara yɛ yaw.
No one can tell any of us anything.	Obiara ntumi nka biribiara nkyerɛ yɛn mu biara.
Know yourself.	Hu wo ho.
They don’t have to be good at it.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔn ho akokwaw wɔ mu.
You walk with me.	Wo ne me nantew.
He knows his name.	Onim ne din.
The figure's hands and arms are at his side.	Mfonini no nsa ne ne nsa wɔ ne nkyɛn.
He did the animal experiments.	Ɔyɛɛ mmoa mu sɔhwɛ ahorow no.
Not at all.	Ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
Never say never.	Nka da sɛ da.
I will almost certainly do that.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
There was more to the story, more to him.	Ná pii wɔ asɛm no mu, pii wɔ ne ho.
There is a lot of work to be done with each installation.	Adwuma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔ biribiara a wɔde besi hɔ no ho.
This is a good thing	Eyi yɛ ade pa .
This is what actually happened.	Eyi ne nea esii ankasa.
It is something very important.	Ɛyɛ biribi a ɛho hia paa.
You know why that is.	Wunim nea enti a ɛte saa.
It must be late.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea aka akyi.
This animal has gone into a deep decline.	Saa mmoa yi akɔ fam kɛse mu.
Make a plan for it.	Yɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
Sleep came to him quickly.	Nna baa ne nkyɛn ntɛm.
Hope is something.	Anidaso yɛ biribi.
She is certainly beautiful, but she has absolutely nothing to do.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ, nanso onni biribiara a ɔbɛyɛ koraa.
I can be that guy.	Metumi ayɛ saa ɔbarima no.
I also want a name.	Mepɛ din nso.
We admire them both.	Yɛn ani gye wɔn baanu nyinaa ho.
I'm doing that.	Mereyɛ saa.
I know your names.	Minim mo din.
Like, really great.	Te sɛ, kɛse ankasa.
He wants me to be a girl in it.	Ɔpɛ sɛ meyɛ abeawa wɔ mu.
First real group of people.	Nnipa kuw ankasa a edi kan.
However, that may not be the case for everyone.	Nanso, ebia ɛnyɛ saa wɔ obiara fam.
However, the pictures were.	Nanso, na mfonini ahorow no ne.
Even his money was expendable.	Ná ne sika mpo yɛ nea wɔde di dwuma.
Put on your shoes.	Hyɛ wo mpaboa.
My legs hurt.	Me nan yɛ me yaw.
We can’t get there soon enough.	Yɛrentumi nkɔ hɔ ntɛm.
I was a father.	Ná meyɛ papa.
I don’t have too many friends.	Minni nnamfo pii dodo.
I think a lot of people do.	Misusuw sɛ nnipa pii yɛ saa.
He has a license.	Ɔwɔ tumi krataa.
One last moment.	Bere a etwa to biako.
Maybe he didn’t have to do anything.	Ebia na enhia sɛ ɔyɛ biribiara.
Kids go in, they do.	Mmofra kɔ mu, wɔyɛ.
We were there yesterday evening.	Ná yɛwɔ hɔ nnɛra anwummere.
At least it does here.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ saa wɔ ha.
Finally, your father is there.	Awiei koraa no, wo papa wɔ hɔ.
However, the boy seemed to be doing well.	Nanso, na ɛte sɛ nea abarimaa no reyɛ yiye.
Maybe a lot of time.	Ebia bere pii.
One man	Ɔbarima biako .
I don’t need money.	Sika ho nhia me.
I don’t like him very much.	M’ani nnye ne ho kɛse.
Check it out, if you like.	Hwɛ mu, sɛ wopɛ a.
I still have a couple of things to do.	Meda so ara wɔ nneɛma abien bi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
None of that matters anymore.	Ɛno mu biara ho nhia bio.
I know your wife.	Minim wo yere.
And it wasn’t his mother.	Na ɛnyɛ ne maame.
However, it had happened before.	Nanso, na asi pɛn.
In a way, he was.	Ɔkwan bi so no na ɔte saa.
I can’t see them.	Mintumi nhu wɔn.
There are a number of risks in this industry.	Asiane dodow bi wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
The incident happened yesterday.	Asɛm no sii nnɛra.
It’s not a story.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm bi.
It didn't matter either way.	Ná ɛnyɛ hwee wɔ ɔkwan abien no nyinaa so.
There will likely be several of them.	Ɛda adi sɛ wɔn mu dodow bi bɛba.
Too late, too late, too late.	Akyiri dodo, aka akyi dodo, aka akyi dodo.
They can do it themselves.	Wɔn ankasa betumi ayɛ.
I'm with him.	Me ne no.
Your best shot.	Wo tuo a eye sen biara.
The underlying concept is quite simple.	Adwene a ɛwɔ ase no yɛ mmerɛw koraa.
I'm good.	Me ho yɛ.
This is absolutely true.	Eyi yɛ nokware ankasa.
I wondered what he was doing.	Misusuw nea ɔreyɛ ho.
I think it’s a very good approach.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ ɔkwan pa paa.
People stare at him.	Nkurɔfo hwɛ no denneennen.
But at the same time, the testing team was becoming increasingly difficult.	Nanso bere koro no ara mu no, na sɔhwɛ kuw no reyɛ den kɛse.
That’s why it is for me too.	Ɛno nti na ɛte saa ma me nso.
That doesn’t mean anything.	Ɛno nkyerɛ hwee.
Like a child.	Te sɛ abofra.
It wasn’t even another animal.	Ná ɛnyɛ mmoa foforo mpo.
People have seen them.	Nkurɔfo ahu wɔn.
Affordable prices make people happy.	Bo a ɛyɛ den ma nkurɔfo ani gye.
There are many good and interesting pictures.	Mfonini ahorow a eye na ɛyɛ anigye pii wɔ hɔ.
Like now.	Te sɛ mprempren.
Beautiful people.	Nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
This is not the issue here.	Eyi nyɛ asɛm a ɛwɔ ha no.
I know what that looks like.	Minim sɛnea ɛno te.
Be as good as you are.	Yɛ papa sɛnea woyɛ no.
I'm one of them.	Meyɛ biako.
And it’s still here.	Na ɛda so ara wɔ ha.
The whole city was under water.	Kurow no nyinaa hyɛɛ nsu ase.
Never take anything for granted.	Mfa biribiara nyɛ hwee da.
This bed is not comfortable.	Saa mpa yi nyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
No one talks about it anymore.	Obiara nka ho asɛm bio.
That’s a lot!	Ɛno yɛ pii!
It was a mistake.	Ná ɛyɛ mfomso.
The walk was interesting.	Ná nantew no yɛ anigye.
But he wasn’t very interested.	Nanso na n’ani nnye ho kɛse.
He always told me that.	Ná ɔka kyerɛ me saa bere nyinaa.
This is like the end.	Eyi te sɛ awiei no.
Sex doesn’t have to be a bad thing, if you can help it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ nna yɛ ade bɔne, sɛ wubetumi aboa a.
That is their way.	Ɛno ne wɔn kwan.
It’s the truth.	Ɛyɛ nokware no.
Anyway, the kids really enjoyed them.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, mmofra no ani gyee wɔn ho ankasa.
What had happened.	Nea na asi.
He could work with these people.	Ná obetumi ne saa nkurɔfo yi ayɛ adwuma.
And he was right, too.	Na ɔno nso asɛm no yɛ nokware.
I am the worst.	Me na meyɛ bɔne sen biara.
But not anything else.	Nanso ɛnyɛ biribi foforo biara.
You only have one shot.	Wowɔ tuo biako pɛ.
Like he was a dog.	Te sɛ nea na ɔyɛ ɔkraman.
Anyone can do the simple hard ones.	Obiara betumi ayɛ nea ɛyɛ den a ɛnyɛ den no.
The city is always crowded.	Kurow no mu nnipa ahyɛ hɔ ma bere nyinaa.
And at that time,.	Na saa bere no,.
I think he’ll like it.	Misusuw sɛ n’ani begye ho.
Please don’t touch that!	Mesrɛ wo, mfa wo nsa nka saa!
We are a group.	Yɛyɛ kuw bi.
They’re all right.	Wɔn nyinaa.
Maybe not us anymore either.	Ebia ɛnyɛ yɛn nso bio.
He never knew.	Onnim da.
Give me everything.	Ma me biribiara.
Anyway, that’s not our problem.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛnyɛ ɛno ne yɛn haw.
That they were a group of people.	Sɛ na wɔyɛ nnipa kuw.
She was young and beautiful.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He was fully in the moment, focused solely on the present.	Ná ɔwɔ bere no mu koraa, na ɔde n’adwene asi mprempren nkutoo so.
But there is no one.	Nanso obiara nni hɔ.
It was no longer working.	Ná ɛnyɛ adwuma bio.
Someone has one.	Obi wɔ bi.
The whole thing.	Asɛm no nyinaa.
That’s all that matters.	Ɛno nkutoo ne nea ɛho hia.
I am not good at this.	Menyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw wɔ eyi mu.
I can't seem to figure out why though.	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nhu nea enti a ɛte saa nanso.
People are complicated.	Nkurɔfo yɛ wɔn a wɔn ho yɛ den.
The trend continues.	Su no kɔ so.
He didn’t have it in him.	Na onni bi wɔ ne mu.
We need to work to end this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma ma eyi ba awiei.
You have to tell me what’s wrong.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka nea ɛyɛ bɔne kyerɛ me.
How terrifying that can be.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛno betumi ayɛ hu.
They are concerned about his fragile condition.	Ne tebea a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no haw wɔn.
Let that go, too.	Ma ɛno nso nkɔ.
I hear that story.	Mete saa asɛm no.
Why it is so important.	Nea enti a ɛho hia saa.
I loved both of these books.	Ná m’ani gye nhoma abien yi nyinaa ho.
And he was just a boy.	Na na ɔyɛ abarimaa ara kwa.
That’s very interesting.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
I had done so many things.	Ná mayɛ nneɛma pii saa.
He was no longer there.	Ná onni hɔ bio.
He has a great presence.	Ɔwɔ baabi a ɔwɔ kɛse.
I’m a lot happier today.	M’ani agye pii nnɛ.
It looks a little scary out there.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu kakra wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
The reason for this is unclear.	Nea enti a wɔyɛ saa no mu nna hɔ.
He really enjoyed it.	N’ani gyee ho ankasa.
That made my day.	Ɛno maa me da no yɛɛ kɛse.
He really uses his hands.	Ɔde ne nsa di dwuma ankasa.
I was very impressed.	M’ani gyee ho kɛse.
No one can doubt them.	Obiara ntumi nnye wɔn ho kyim.
He had done it again.	Ná wayɛ bio.
Not this bad last year, right?	Ɛnyɛ bɔne yi afe a etwaam no, ɛnte saa?
Should.	Ɛwɔ sɛ.
She liked the feel of his hands.	N’ani gyee sɛnea ne nsa no te nka sɛ ɛyɛ den no ho.
The money is very tight.	Sika no mu yɛ den yiye.
See how your father or mine.	Hwɛ sɛnea wo papa anaa me de.
No one wants to do that.	Obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
The quality of this product is not good.	Saa ade yi su nyɛ papa.
I don’t control anything.	Minni biribiara so.
I need to see the game.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu agoru no.
Don’t leave the house.	Mma mfi fie hɔ.
Many people come every year.	Nnipa pii ba afe biara.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
However, this did not work this time.	Nanso, eyi anyɛ adwuma saa bere yi.
He had his eyes on me.	Ná n’ani da me so.
People are not very happy with this system.	Nkurɔfo ani nnye nhyehyɛe yi ho kɛse.
The better and stronger you are, the more you can offer.	Dodow a woyɛ papa na wo ho yɛ den no, dodow no ara na wubetumi de nneɛma pii ama.
The same two children.	Mmofra baanu koro no ara.
Keep going deeper in the meantime.	Kɔ so kɔ akyiri wɔ saa bere no mu.
The big day.	Da kɛse no.
She wrapped her arms around her son.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne ba no ho.
They are usually interested.	Mpɛn pii no, wɔn ani gye ho.
Hurry!	Ka wo ho!
The next night, too.	Anadwo a edi hɔ no nso.
He was already alive.	Ná ɔte ase dedaw.
The back feels there.	Akyi no te nka sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
Nothing like that mattered.	Ná biribiara a ɛte saa ho nhia.
Mood.	Tebea.
I certainly could have done that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na metumi ayɛ saa.
But there are some problems.	Nanso ɔhaw ahorow bi wɔ hɔ.
I don’t think he will.	Minsusuw sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I was careful.	Ná mehwɛ yiye.
Almost never, really.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ da, ankasa.
He glanced out the window again.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu bio.
Comfortable walking shoes.	Mpaboa a ɛyɛ fɛ a wɔde nantew.
That is not true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware.
He made his way home.	Ɔde kwan kɔɔ fie.
It was here, in the house.	Na ɛwɔ ha, wɔ fie hɔ.
They certainly offer good things that way.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔde nneɛma pa ma wɔ saa kwan no so.
At the time this seemed to be it.	Saa bere no na ɛte sɛ nea eyi ne no.
It feels so amazing here.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye wɔ ha.
It never worked on this highway.	Ná ɛnyɛ adwuma wɔ saa kwan kɛse yi so da.
Establishing quality control systems.	Nhyehyɛe ahorow a wɔde hwɛ sɛnea nneɛma te yiye a wɔde besi hɔ.
Take it that way.	Fa no saa.
A wonderful job! 	Adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa!
Too late now.	Akyiri dodo mprempren.
How did that happen?.	Ɛno yɛɛ dɛn?.
Therefore, the processing time will be much longer.	Enti, bere a wɔde yɛ adwuma no bɛyɛ tenten kɛse.
Fortunately, there is a door.	Nea eye ne sɛ, ɔpon bi wɔ hɔ.
Don’t let anyone else use it.	Mma obi foforo biara mfa nni dwuma.
He was that good.	Ná ɔyɛ papa saa.
In my opinion anyway.	Wɔ m’adwene mu ɔkwan biara so.
A true thought itself.	Nokware adwene ankasa.
It’s hard to.	Ɛyɛ den.
But that’s not the only problem.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo ne ɔhaw no.
He seemed to know exactly what to do.	Ɛte sɛ nea na onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ankasa.
It’s after that now.	Ɛyɛ ɛno akyi mprempren.
It’s not your truth.	Ɛnyɛ wo nokware.
Everything we do is wrong.	Biribiara a yɛyɛ no yɛ mfomso.
Thoughts will just scare you.	Adwene bɛbɔ wo hu kɛkɛ.
Why do we always do the same things?	Dɛn nti na yɛyɛ nneɛma koro no ara bere nyinaa?
Thank you, thank you.	Meda wo ase, meda wo ase.
It was a long night.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo tenten bi.
Everyone is excited.	Obiara ani agye.
This is a meeting for everyone.	Eyi yɛ nhyiam ma obiara.
I couldn’t see them.	Na mintumi nhu wɔn.
My only chance.	Me hokwan biako pɛ.
Maybe that will lead to something.	Ebia ɛno bɛma biribi aba.
Everything was beautiful.	Ná biribiara yɛ fɛ.
Apparently not while he was performing.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ bere a na ɔreyɛ agoru no.
It’s a simple task.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛnyɛ den.
I never had the money.	Ná minni sika no da.
There must be something final in this matter.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi a etwa to wɔ asɛm yi mu.
He was taken out of the house.	Wɔde no fii fie hɔ.
One way is to use two images.	Ɔkwan biako ne sɛ wode mfonini abien bedi dwuma.
The mistake is entirely my fault.	Mfomso no yɛ me mfomso koraa.
And maybe it will be.	Na ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I don’t think he ever did.	Minsusuw sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa da.
That said, a little more variety would have been nice.	Ɛno akyi no, anka nneɛma ahorow kakra a wɔde di dwuma no bɛyɛ fɛ.
I think it should work.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
Strange things happened out there, too.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii wɔ abɔnten hɔ, nso.
This danger is terrible.	Asiane yi yɛ hu.
Not in that situation.	Ɛnyɛ saa tebea no mu.
It’s a test.	Ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ.
Keep moving.	Kɔ so tu.
He was very interested in it.	Ná n’ani gye ho paa.
I need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
No one raised his hand.	Obiara amma ne nsa so.
It’s never part of what’s going on.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so no fã da.
Fill with fresh water.	Fa nsu pa hyɛ mu ma.
Many things are important.	Nneɛma pii ho hia.
That was impressive enough.	Ná ɛno yɛ nwonwa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
But people didn’t like him.	Nanso na nkurɔfo ani nnye ne ho.
He knew he was.	Ná onim sɛ ɔte saa.
This applies to us as well.	Eyi fa yɛn nso ho.
Maybe this very day.	Ebia saa da yi ara.
Not from any of them.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn mu biara hɔ.
It’s a school system.	Ɛyɛ sukuu nhyehyɛe.
I was amazed at how similar they were.	Sɛnea na wɔn ho yɛ pɛ no maa me ho dwiriw me.
That was about three years ago.	Ná ɛyɛ bɛyɛ mfe abiɛsa a atwam ni.
I would be very happy to be wrong about that though!.	M'ani begye yiye sɛ mɛyɛ mfomso wɔ saa asɛm no ho de, nanso!.
Not a good time.	Ɛnyɛ bere pa bi.
I had to go to work tomorrow.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ adwuma ɔkyena.
Animals are rapidly becoming endangered.	Mmoa rekɔ asiane mu ntɛmntɛm.
There has to be a better way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ.
The man comes in.	Ɔbarima no ba mu.
But he doesn't know if he can.	Nanso onnim sɛ ebia obetumi ayɛ saa anaa.
He touched it with his hand.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ho.
And nothing happened.	Na biribiara amma.
There are some simple things we can do.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw a yebetumi ayɛ.
I know where he might be.	Minim baabi a ebia ɔwɔ.
Anything else means error.	Biribi foforo biara kyerɛ mfomso.
It’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
But this is something else.	Nanso eyi yɛ ade foforo.
And that he did.	Na sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
I don’t want people to have to go through the same thing.	Mempɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo fa ade koro no ara mu.
He should be here too.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno nso wɔ ha.
Not what you wanted at all.	Ɛnyɛ nea na wopɛ koraa.
They are good.	Wɔyɛ papa.
However, he is truly amazing.	Nanso, ne ho yɛ nwonwa ampa.
Who had he done it to? 	Hena na na wayɛ no?
I think he can.	Misusuw sɛ obetumi.
They looked at each other with interest.	Wɔde anigye hwɛɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
This offense should work for him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ saa mfomso yi yɛ adwuma ma no.
This didn’t seem to matter much.	Ɛte sɛ nea na eyi ho nhia pii.
Such additives are very dangerous.	Nneɛma a wɔde ka ho a ɛte saa no yɛ nea asiane wom kɛse.
There is no such school.	Sukuu a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ.
The higher our price, the higher our quality.	Sɛ yɛn bo yɛ den a, yɛn su no bɛyɛ kɛse.
I was just there.	Ná mewɔ hɔ ara kwa.
It was such a pleasure.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye a ɛte saa.
Good job everyone to keep up the great work.	Adwuma pa obiara sɛ ɔbɛkɔ so ayɛ adwuma kɛse.
At least that wasn’t true for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛno nyɛ nokware wɔ me fam.
This is not ideal.	Eyi nyɛ nea eye sen biara.
Please get a pre-order.	Mesrɛ mo, di kan fa krataa a wɔde bɛma me.
This is a two bedroom house.	Eyi yɛ ofie a ɛwɔ mpa abien.
You would be perfect.	Anka wobɛyɛ pɛ.
You know what to paint.	Wunim nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho mfonini.
He is really good at what he does.	Ɔyɛ obi a onim nea ɔyɛ no yiye ankasa.
And there will be many people.	Na nnipa pii bɛba.
This new book contains fascinating illustrations.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ nhoma foforo yi mu.
Saying it out loud is another.	Sɛ́ wobɛka no den no yɛ ade foforo.
The last one.	Nea etwa to no.
His eyes didn’t see.	N’ani anhu ade.
I have to be very careful with him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye paa wɔ ne ho.
Most probably don’t.	Ebia dodow no ara nyɛ saa.
And the days can get really intense too.	Na nna no nso betumi ayɛ kɛse ankasa.
You can’t have it all.	Worentumi nnya ne nyinaa.
I really believe it.	Migye di ampa.
As you wish.	Sɛnea wopɛ.
It would be part of the production process.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ nneɛma a wɔyɛ no fã.
But there are other possibilities.	Nanso nneɛma foforo nso betumi aba.
Already too fast.	Dedaw ntɛmntɛm dodo.
It’s another day.	Ɛyɛ da foforo.
That’s why we have the job.	Ɛno nti na yɛwɔ adwuma no.
Thank him for doing this.	Da no ase sɛ wayɛ eyi.
This is where we are.	Eyi ne baabi a yɛwɔ.
Water runs, cold and cold.	Nsu tu mmirika, awɔw ne awɔw.
It’s possible.	Ɛyɛ yiye.
Provide at least two.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, fa abien ma.
I’m not feeling well.	Me ho nyɛ me den.
He is first in time.	Ɔno na odi kan wɔ bere mu.
You can’t let a good man down.	Worentumi mma ɔbarima pa nkɔ fam.
One has to stay home with them most of the time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi ne wɔn tra fie bere dodow no ara.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
You are too big.	Woyɛ kɛse dodo.
Use them when you have time for them.	Fa di dwuma bere a wowɔ bere ma wɔn no.
A month later.	Ɔsram biako akyi.
I'm doing it.	Meyɛ no.
I don’t even want to do it.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ mpo.
Everyone knows now.	Obiara nim mprempren.
He looked away.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ baabi foforo.
And they’ve touched you.	Na wɔde wɔn nsa aka wo.
In this case you should seem very surprised.	Wɔ eyi mu no ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte sɛ nea wo ho dwiriw wo kɛse.
They were wonderful days.	Ná ɛyɛ nna a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I should have looked into it.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu.
This was going to be a long night.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ anadwo tenten.
I'm not sure this is even possible.	Me nnim sɛ eyi betumi ayɛ yiye mpo.
Put the dog down.	Fa ɔkraman no to hɔ.
Everyone knew everything.	Ná obiara nim biribiara.
Even that.	Ɛno mpo.
That’s what truth is.	Ɛno ne nea nokware yɛ.
Close it, it isn’t.	To mu, ɛnte saa.
I like this one too.	M’ani gye eyi nso ho.
And that’s how they should be.	Na saa na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Anyone can come in.	Obiara betumi aba mu.
The water was warm.	Ná nsu no mu yɛ hyew.
That’s another story.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo.
He set up a meeting.	Ɔde nhyiam bi sii hɔ.
There are many of us.	Yɛn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
It’s a great car.	Ɛyɛ kar kɛse bi.
He seemed familiar.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onim no yiye.
He knows what happened.	Onim nea esii.
That seems to be gone now.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno afi hɔ mprempren.
I just feel like .	Mete nka ara kwa sɛ .
Each of them over the years.	Wɔn mu biara wɔ mfe no mu.
This was a real meal for him.	Ná eyi yɛ aduan ankasa ma no.
Much really.	Pii ankasa.
That’s not what we have today.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea yɛwɔ nnɛ.
How beautiful it is!	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye!
Another story tells how the children's father saved their lives.	Asɛm foforo nso ka sɛnea mmofra no papa gyee wɔn nkwa ho asɛm.
He slammed his hand on the table.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ pon no so.
He just didn't want to do it anymore.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ bio kɛkɛ.
On everything.	Wɔ biribiara so.
The pictures were just stunning.	Ná mfonini ahorow no yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
Time is running out.	Bere reyɛ ayɛ tiaa.
Follow the money.	Di sika no akyi.
For a moment, none of them really.	Bere tiaa bi mu no, wɔn mu biara ankasa.
They are just themselves.	Wɔyɛ wɔn ankasa ara kwa.
They seemed unhappy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani nnye.
They are more interested than ever.	Wɔn ani gye ho sen bere biara.
Even when it feels harder than ever.	Bere a ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ den sen bere biara mpo no.
A few of these cars are still in service.	Kar ahorow yi mu kakraa bi da so ara yɛ adwuma.
Do as you please.	Yɛ sɛnea wopɛ.
Something needs to be done to end this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi na ama eyi aba awiei.
His time had passed.	Ná ne bere atwam.
But this immediately got me thinking.	Nanso eyi maa misusuw ho ntɛm ara.
The situation is much better now.	Tebea no ayɛ yiye kɛse mprempren.
It was just a game for him.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru ara kwa ma no.
But the problem is you don’t.	Nanso ɔhaw no ne sɛ wonyɛ.
So, why does no one do anything?	Enti, dɛn nti na obiara nyɛ hwee?
I don’t want my wife to go to work.	Mempɛ sɛ me yere bɛkɔ adwuma.
I want to bring this water to the surface.	Mepɛ sɛ mede saa nsu yi ba nsu no ani.
I don’t mean anything.	Me nkyerɛ hwee.
And to him, what he had was everything.	Na ne fam no, nea na ɔwɔ no yɛ biribiara.
That’s what you see.	Ɛno ne nea wuhu.
But apparently it doesn’t work.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma.
There are movie characters.	Sini mu nnipa wɔ hɔ.
At least it’s not good.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ papa.
All he wants is for them to do so.	Nea ɔpɛ ara ne sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
The film has a happy ending.	Sini no wɔ awiei a ɛyɛ anigye.
She was incredibly beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
But it has done so.	Nanso ayɛ saa.
My father was allergic to alcohol.	Ná me papa ho yɛ no hyew wɔ nsa ho.
It was never supposed to be good.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ papa da.
Please, just a moment.	Mesrɛ wo, bere tiaa bi pɛ.

They use some of the highest quality ingredients in their products.	Wɔde nneɛma a ɛyɛ papa sen biara no bi di dwuma wɔ wɔn nneɛma a wɔyɛ mu.
I just didn't want to do that.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa ara kwa.
It’s not that late.	Ɛnyɛ nea aka akyi saa.
He knew the people needed him there.	Ná onim sɛ nkurɔfo no hia no wɔ hɔ.
That’s what we do.	Ɛno ne nea yɛyɛ.
Often there was just too much money to spend.	Mpɛn pii no, na sika pii ara kwa na ɛwɔ hɔ a wɔde di dwuma.
It didn’t matter much.	Ná ɛho nhia pii.
See if you see anything.	Hwɛ sɛ wuhu biribi anaa.
You have to tell yourself that you are better than the next guy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka kyerɛ wo ho sɛ woyɛ papa sen ɔbarima a odi hɔ no.
Do what you have to do.	Yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I wanted to believe him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye no di.
The people say that animals speak.	Nkurɔfo no ka sɛ mmoa kasa.
I wasn’t surprised.	Anyɛ me nwonwa.
That’s part of the problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no fã.
On the bed.	Wɔ mpa no so.
And your book.	Ne wo nhoma no.
I burned out last time.	Me ho hyew bere a etwaam no.
I think it’s a very positive story.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ papa yiye.
This road is busy from morning till night.	Adagyew nni saa kwan yi so fi anɔpa kosi anadwo.
I don’t really know.	Minnim ankasa.
He ran down the aisle.	Ɔde mmirika faa ɔkwan a ɛda hɔ no so.
Take them and give me one.	Fa wɔn na fa biako ma me.
It never really gets better.	Ɛnyɛ yiye da ankasa.
I'm perfect.	Meyɛ pɛ.
The car was always fast.	Kar no yɛɛ ntɛmntɛm bere nyinaa.
It is easy to use and works well.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wode bedi dwuma na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
You seem to know a lot about them.	Ɛte sɛ nea wunim wɔn ho nsɛm pii.
I wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or not.	Ná minnim sɛ ebia ɛno yɛ ade pa anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
Much of the music reflects this.	Nnwom no fã kɛse no ara da eyi adi.
This experiment was successful.	Saa sɔhwɛ yi dii yiye.
I will go to classes with him.	Me ne no bɛkɔ adesua ahorow mu.
This book is nothing new.	Saa nhoma yi nyɛ ade foforo.
Look at this.	Hwɛ eyi.
It was outside.	Ná ɛwɔ abɔnten.
You don’t need to think about that now either.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wususuw saa asɛm no ho mprempren nso.
Just one word.	Asɛm biako pɛ.
It’s been a while.	Ayɛ bere tiaa bi.
That's not me at these prices.	Ɛno nyɛ me wɔ saa nneɛma bo yi mu.
Everyone goes home.	Obiara kɔ fie.
He does that from time to time.	Ɔyɛ saa bere ne bere mu.
He knew what would be more interesting.	Ná onim nea ɛbɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
However, if anything, it works too well as a complete story.	Nanso, sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, ɛyɛ adwuma yiye dodo sɛ asɛm a edi mũ.
A team had to work quickly.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ kuw bi yɛ adwuma ntɛmntɛm.
In other words, everyone is going to use it as is.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, obiara rekɔ de adi dwuma sɛnea ɛte no.
Animals are not what they seem.	Mmoa nyɛ nea ɛte sɛ nea ɛte no.
Your wife is very beautiful.	Wo yere ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
A squirrel-like animal.	Aboa a ɔte sɛ ɔkraman.
It sounds terrible.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
He is a child.	Ɔyɛ abofra.
We both knew that.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa nim saa.
It never matters.	Ɛnyɛ hwee da.
I think that’s a mistake.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ mfomso.
On this day, one was not.	Saa da yi, na biako nyɛ saa.
But his time had come.	Nanso na ne bere adu.
I will give him a task that he can handle this time.	Mede adwuma bi a obetumi adi ho dwuma saa bere yi bɛma no.
People want their work to matter.	Nkurɔfo pɛ sɛ wɔn adwuma no ho hia.
Their children, gone.	Wɔn mma, akɔ.
Be extra careful, he says.	Ɔka sɛ, hwɛ yiye kɛse.
There are two reasons for this.	Nneɛma abien nti na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Surely everyone else does.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ obiara a aka no yɛ saa.
They were sinful.	Ná wɔyɛ bɔne.
However, it is worse than that.	Nanso, ɛyɛ bɔne sen saa.
I don’t know why that is.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Your life is important to you.	Wo nkwa hia wo.
It’s important again on the phone.	Ɛho hia bio wɔ telefon so.
How many people are there in the city?	Nnipa dodow ahe na ɛwɔ kurow no mu?
Keep moving.	Kɔ so tu.
He didn’t like that.	Ná n’ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
Maybe people like this.	Ebia nkurɔfo ani gye eyi ho.
He was a weakling.	Ná ɔyɛ mmerɛw.
Just get out of there .	Fi hɔ kɛkɛ .
Both of those things were new to us.	Ná saa nneɛma abien no nyinaa yɛ ade foforo ma yɛn.
I would be a girl.	Anka mɛyɛ abeawa.
You need to be familiar with this concept.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu saa adwene yi yiye.
Most of the time, he enjoyed it.	Mpɛn pii no, na n’ani gye ho.
We have to do bad things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nneɛma bɔne.
Just go home now.	Kɔ fie kɛkɛ mprempren.
But someone had to do it.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ.
At the end of the day, you want it.	Ɛda no awiei no, wopɛ.
He was very very fast.	Ná ɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm yiye paa.
Everyone wants money.	Obiara pɛ sika.
I didn’t have to do that.	Ná enhia sɛ meyɛ saa.
Maybe it’s a test.	Ebia ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ bi.
That’s how he was.	Saa na na ɔte.
The sooner he recovered cold, the better.	Dodow a ne ho tɔɔ no ntɛm a awɔw wom no, dodow no ara na eye.
I miss his touch immediately this can't be good.	Mepa ne nsa a ɔde ka no ntɛm ara eyi ntumi nyɛ papa.
I am very sorry about these comments.	Ɛyɛ me yaw paa wɔ saa nsɛm yi ho.
It seems to be the same.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
There was little time.	Ná bere kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
He was very fond of his father.	Ná n’ani gye ne papa ho kɛse.
It’s the most important thing right now .	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛho hia sen biara mprempren .
She is a great girl.	Ɔyɛ abeawa kɛse.
You are very very beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ yiye paa.
But it was then and this is now.	Nanso na ɛte saa bere no na eyi ne mprempren.
What matters is the one point.	Nea ɛho hia ne asɛm biako no.
Get out of the city.	Fi kurow no mu.
So please do what you can.	Enti mesrɛ wo, yɛ nea wubetumi.
No one says anything for a moment.	Obiara nka hwee kakra.
However, it is not so easy.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
I’ll be relieved.	Me ho bɛtɔ me.
You seem to have that more than most.	Ɛte sɛ nea wowɔ saa sen dodow no ara.
I can’t get there yet.	Mintumi nkɔ hɔ de besi nnɛ.
Which will be the same here so.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ saa ara wɔ ha saa.
However, this need not be the case.	Nanso, ɛho nhia sɛ eyi yɛ saa.
Full of beautiful pictures.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ ahyɛ mu ma.
That bothers me.	Ɛno haw me.
It could easily be mine.	Ná ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ me de.
I don’t want to know.	Mempɛ sɛ mihu.
It seemed like the perfect opportunity.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hokwan a edi mũ.
It just looked like it was in a movie.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ sini mu ara kwa.
The dry season will end soon.	Ɔpɛ bere no bɛba awiei nnansa yi ara.
He seemed to like her a lot.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye ne ho kɛse.
Your work here is over now.	Wo adwuma wɔ ha no aba awiei mprempren.
However, some water supplies are serious problems.	Nanso, nsu a wɔde ma no bi haw kɛse.
This movie has everything.	Saa sini yi wɔ biribiara.
However, a house.	Nanso, ofie bi.
It was hard to focus on him.	Ná ɛyɛ den sɛ mede m’adwene besi ne so.
Learning is a lifelong occupation.	Adesua yɛ adwuma a obi yɛ wɔ ne nkwa nna nyinaa mu.
And you can’t do anything.	Na worentumi nyɛ hwee.
In my city.	Wɔ me kurow mu.
This might be their best meal today.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ wɔn aduan a eye sen biara nnɛ.
He worked in human resources.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma wɔ nnipa ho adwuma mu.
But there was no reason to add another.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde foforo ka ho.
He had almost nothing.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na onni hwee.
Don’t start with your size.	Mfa wo kɛse no mfi ase.
I just barely understand it yet.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ meda so ara nte ase ara kwa.
You think you’d like that.	Wususuw sɛ w’ani begye saa asɛm no ho.
And he loved me.	Na na ɔpɛ me.
That is the first point.	Ɛno ne asɛm a edi kan.
There is real work to be done.	Adwuma ankasa wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Now  .	Seesei .
Not any of them.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn mu biara.
There was a lot of bad language.	Ná kasa bɔne pii wɔ hɔ.
They were amazing.	Ná wɔyɛ nwonwa.
He was a truly remarkable man.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa a ne ho yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
Children are said to be a prodigy at that age.	Wɔka sɛ mmofra yɛ obi a ɔyɛ nwonwa wɔ saa mfe no mu.
We had a hot car.	Ná yɛwɔ kar bi a ɛyɛ hyew.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnte saa.
Such a statement should not be made now.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔka asɛm a ɛte saa mprempren.
A long time ago.	Bere tenten a atwam.
It’s just going to happen.	Ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
No one can see us.	Obiara ntumi nhu yɛn.
I’m so glad you like it though.	M’ani agye yiye sɛ w’ani gye ho nanso.
All of these things worked in a positive way.	Saa nneɛma yi nyinaa yɛɛ adwuma wɔ ɔkwan pa so.
Rely on it for a while.	Fa wo ho to so kakra.
The one who seemed so happy two days ago.	Nea na ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye kɛse nna abien a atwam no.
We offer many services.	Yɛde nnwuma pii ma.
She was even more beautiful than her picture.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ sen ne mfonini no mpo.
We are better than them.	Yɛyɛ papa sen wɔn.
But he didn't want to do that.	Nanso na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Look at what he’s done.	Hwɛ nea wayɛ.
But that’s all in the past.	Nanso ɛno nyinaa yɛ nea atwam.
Most of them said the same thing.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara kaa asɛm koro no ara.
It was just the way it was.	Ná ɛyɛ sɛnea na ɛte no ara kwa.
Think about it that way.	Susuw ho saa.
There will be an opportunity.	Hokwan bi bɛba.
You have to accept this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye eyi tom.
This further complicates our problem.	Eyi ma yɛn haw no yɛ den kɛse.
Maybe the movie is still on.	Ebia sini no da so ara wɔ so.
That’s what you see.	Ɛno ne nea wuhu.
A beautiful house.	Ofie a ɛyɛ fɛ.
There is no doubt that we will.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa.
If not, you know how tough it is in this city.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, wunim sɛnea ɛyɛ den wɔ kurow yi mu.
That’s really all there is here.	Ɛno nkutoo ne nea ɛwɔ ha ankasa.
Apologize for everything.	Pa kyɛw wɔ biribiara ho.
Or at least it seemed that way.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
We were all kids once.	Ná yɛn nyinaa yɛ mmofra bere bi.
To do this, you need to submit a test form.	Sɛ wobɛyɛ eyi a, ɛsɛ sɛ wode sɔhwɛ krataa ma.
Nor, so far, was anything of the sort.	Saa ara nso na, de besi nnɛ, na ɛnyɛ biribiara a ɛte saa.
Maybe now more than ever.	Ebia mprempren sen bere biara.
I have to do the same.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me nso meyɛ saa.
In a different way.	Ɔkwan foforo bi so.
That would be really bad.	Ɛno bɛyɛ bɔne ankasa.
She shrugged her shoulders tightly.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ ne ho denneennen.
Can anyone help me.	So obi betumi aboa me.
And as he says.	Na sɛnea ɔka no.
If not now, in the next.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ mprempren a, wɔ nea edi hɔ no mu.
It will be this story today, it will be something else tomorrow.	Ɛbɛyɛ saa asɛm yi nnɛ, ɛbɛyɛ biribi foforo ɔkyena.
She is very beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
The truth of the matter was immediately apparent.	Ná asɛm no mu nokware no da adi ntɛm ara.
What do you have to say about that?.	Dɛn na wowɔ ka fa saa asɛm no ho?.
And have lots of fun with it for a long time.	Na fa gye w’ani pii bere tenten.
He came running down the road.	Ɔde mmirika baa kwan no so.
The present moment.	Mprempren bere yi.
It was a man.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔbarima bi.
There is much more to be said.	Nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka.
I thought it was.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛte saa.
All these things went through my mind.	Saa nneɛma yi nyinaa faa m’adwene mu.
And it was good and very informative.	Na na eye na na nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ.
Look here, and here, and here.	Hwɛ ha, ne ha, ne ha.
We hope you all enjoyed the session.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ mo nyinaa ani gyee nhyiam no ho.
This problem is very important to me.	Saa ɔhaw yi ho hia me yiye.
I couldn’t see it clearly.	Na mintumi nhu no yiye.
We have the ingredients.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma a wɔde yɛ nneɛma no.
We are very fond of him.	Yɛn ani gye ne ho paa.
You are beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ.
How exactly does he do that?	Ɔkwan bɛn so ankasa na ɔyɛ saa?
But the last few days have not been very good.	Nanso nna kakraa a atwam no nyɛ papa koraa.
If he can.	Sɛ obetumi a.
She’s a good girl, really.	Ɔyɛ abeawa pa, ampa.
Tomorrow was going to be a day.	Ná ɔkyena bɛyɛ da bi.
I even believed it.	Migye dii mpo.
I have figured out how to work this out.	Mayɛ adwene sɛnea mɛyɛ eyi ho adwuma.
Many of you are probably familiar with it.	Ebia mo mu pii nim no yiye.
This is a small amount of water.	Eyi yɛ nsu a ɛyɛ nsu kakraa bi.
Your people, but also theirs.	Wo nkurɔfo, nanso wɔn de nso.
But wonderful or not, it’s a problem.	Nanso ɛyɛ nwonwa anaasɛ ɛnte saa no, ɛyɛ ɔhaw.
It’s almost like you’re actually there.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte sɛ nea wowɔ hɔ ankasa.
This is definitely a word of mouth business.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ asɛm a wɔde ano ka adwuma.
But often it is not.	Nanso mpɛn pii no, ɛnte saa.
So many people gave their lives for him.	Enti nnipa pii de wɔn nkwa too hɔ maa no.
The letter is there.	Krataa no wɔ hɔ.
My father speaks many languages.	Me papa ka kasa ahorow pii.
They are fun	Wɔyɛ anigye .
Most of them are working from home.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara fi fie reyɛ adwuma.
It was a pleasure to have him here.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye sɛ yɛwɔ no wɔ ha.
But the whole thing surprised me.	Nanso asɛm no nyinaa yɛɛ me nwonwa.
For that reason, using them was never wrong.	Ɛno nti, na wɔn a wɔde bedi dwuma no nyɛ mfomso da.
It’s not fun.	Ɛnyɛ anigye.
This took a lot of time.	Eyi gyee bere pii.
He quickly complied.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm dii so.
I have done this.	Mayɛ eyi.
And you don’t either.	Na wo nso wonyɛ saa.
It was a matter of time.	Na ɛyɛ bere ho asɛm.
And the stories keep coming.	Na nsɛm no kɔ so ba.
It’s the nature of a dog to bite.	Ɛyɛ ɔkraman su sɛ ɔbɛka.
I am still afraid of him.	Meda so ara suro no.
Few people work.	Nnipa kakraa bi na wɔyɛ adwuma.
Do you like that hat?	So w’ani gye saa kyɛw no ho?
Now there is no problem.	Seesei ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
So you have another chance.	Enti wowɔ hokwan foforo.
It was my opinion of the shoes as well.	Na ɛyɛ m’adwene wɔ mpaboa no nso ho.
That’s amazing for us.	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa ma yɛn.
There are two reasons for this.	Nneɛma abien nti na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
They could all work, eventually.	Ná wɔn nyinaa betumi ayɛ adwuma, awiei koraa no.
You have to do this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi.
Or many of them.	Anaasɛ wɔn mu pii.
If you drive at night, be very careful.	Sɛ woka kar anadwo a, hwɛ yiye paa.
He worked surprisingly quickly.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma ntɛmntɛm ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Nobody wants him.	Obiara mpɛ no.
And he wasn’t.	Na ɔno nso.
He knew it was very dangerous.	Ná onim sɛ na asiane wom yiye.
But say nothing.	Nanso nka hwee.
Not because he’s a big guy.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse nti.
This was a whole new thing.	Ná eyi yɛ ade foforo koraa.
The quality was amazing.	Ná su no yɛ nwonwa.
Just that.	Kɛkɛ sɛ.
It must be that great!	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse saa!
At the time, I could do nothing to help him.	Saa bere no na mintumi nyɛ hwee mfa mmoa no.
Filmmaking is very popular.	Sini a wɔyɛ no yɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse.
He is a man of great stature.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne tenten yɛ kɛse.
I always had people in my house.	Ná mewɔ nnipa wɔ me fie bere nyinaa.
I thought they were very good.	Misusuwii sɛ wɔyɛ papa paa.
Where does all that water go?	Ɛhe na saa nsu no nyinaa kɔ?
Everyone loved it and we received a lot of feedback.	Obiara ani gyee ho na yɛn nsa kaa nsɛm pii.
Sounds great to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ kɛse ma me.
Every time it felt a little full.	Bere biara a na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ma kakra.
I have things to do.	Mewɔ nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
Just tell me what you want.	Ka nea wopɛ kyerɛ me kɛkɛ.
There are surprises.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ hɔ.
There seems to be a lot of job opportunities.	Ɛte sɛ nea adwuma hokwan ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
You can see it without knowing it.	Wubetumi ahu a wunnim.
Meeting in a public place.	Nhyiam wɔ baabi a nnipa pii wɔ.
This is a very important point.	Saa asɛm yi ho hia kɛse.
That’s the important thing.	Ɛno ne ade a ɛho hia.
That’s why this is so important.	Ɛno nti na eyi ho hia kɛse no.
To remain alone.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a mɛkɔ so ayɛ me nkutoo.
Appearance and appearance are paramount.	Sɛnea ɛte ne sɛnea ɛte no yɛ nea ɛho hia sen biara.
This may be somewhat important.	Ebia eyi ho hia kakra.
He worked a job, my father.	Ná ɔyɛ adwuma bi, me papa.
But the face	Nanso anim no .
But face the truth.	Nanso fa w’ani kyerɛ nokware no.
On the one hand, it’s an interesting film.	Ɔkwan biako so no, ɛyɛ sini a ɛyɛ anigye.
They may be involved, or they may be involved.	Ebia wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu, anaasɛ wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu.
Please, someone tell us another story.	Mesrɛ wo, obi ka asɛm foforo nkyerɛ yɛn.
There’s still room in it for my head.	Ɛda so ara wɔ baabi a ɛwɔ mu ma me ti.
His real name.	Ne din ankasa.
Several cars were involved.	Kar pii de wɔn ho hyɛɛ mu.
But this didn’t happen.	Nanso eyi amma.
And so does he.	Na saa ara na ɔyɛ.
No one ever gave me as much as you did.	Obiara amma me pii te sɛ wo da.
The water looks amazing.	Nsu no hwɛ yɛ nwonwa.
This is a risk you should not take.	Eyi yɛ asiane a ɛnsɛ sɛ wode to mu.
There was nothing otherwise.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛnte saa.
At this point, his mother must have passed away.	Saa bere yi de, ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ne maame atwam.
Do it as often as you can.	Yɛ no mpɛn dodow biara a wubetumi.
You have some of it.	Wowɔ bi.
I doubt it.	Migye ho kyim.
You don’t know anything about it.	Wunnim ho hwee.
He was deeply engrossed in his book.	Ná ɔde ne ho ahyɛ ne nhoma no mu kɛse.
I just didn’t want to be touched.	Ná mempɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa bɛka me kɛkɛ.
Your plan will be quite the same.	Wo nhyehyɛe no bɛyɛ saa ara koraa.
In his very eyes.	Wɔ n’ani so ankasa.
We are part of the system.	Yɛyɛ nhyehyɛe no fã.
I love it here.	M’ani gye ho wɔ ha.
Don’t get started!	Mma mfi ase!
He didn’t have any.	Ná onni bi.
Say your full name.	Ka wo din mũ no nyinaa.
They are an easy target.	Wɔyɛ obi a ɛnyɛ den sɛ wɔde wɔn ani besi so.
He's that good, folks.	Ɔyɛ papa saa, nkurɔfo.
It is at this point that the road hits.	Ɛyɛ saa bere yi na ɔkwan no bɔ.
The dog was very important.	Ná ɔkraman no ho hia yiye.
The other side of me.	Me fã foforo no.
Thank you for your interest.	Meda mo ase sɛ mo ani gye ho.
I will get a new job.	Me nsa bɛka adwuma foforo.
Can you find him?	So wubetumi ahu no?
That was absolutely true.	Ná ɛno yɛ nokware koraa.
It was too late now, so he made the most of it.	Mprempren aka akyi dodo, enti ɔde dii dwuma yiye.
Or maybe just most people.	Anaasɛ ebia nnipa dodow no ara nkutoo.
And it was a mistake.	Na ɛyɛ mfomso.
You know how this feels now.	Wunim sɛnea eyi te nka mprempren.
Or the next one.	Anaasɛ nea edi hɔ no.
Only one idea interested him the most.	Adwene biako pɛ na n’ani gyee ho kɛse.
I had to see him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no.
Not a great opportunity.	Ɛnyɛ hokwan kɛse bi.
But it shouldn’t have been him.	Nanso anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno.
I was very close to my father.	Ná me ne me papa bɛn paa.
He had that much to say, if he had more.	Ná ɔwɔ saa asɛm pii no, sɛ na ɔwɔ pii bio a.
We both have it.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa wɔ bi.
Manage time, one thing at a time.	Fa bere di dwuma yiye, yɛ ade biako biara.
The creative power of a single person is amazing.	Tumi a onipa biako pɛ wɔ sɛ ɔbɔ ade no yɛ nwonwa.
You can tell me the truth.	Wubetumi aka nokware akyerɛ me.
I can't tell if it's true.	Mintumi nhu sɛ ɛyɛ nokware anaa.
You know the words.	Wunim nsɛm no.
There is so much to look at.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a yebetumi ahwɛ.
And in a way, it does.	Na ɔkwan bi so no, ɛyɛ saa.
I go to the window.	Mekɔ mfɛnsere no ho.
I can tell you some of my thoughts.	Metumi aka m’adwene bi akyerɛ mo.
It is no longer their home.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn fie bio.
However, his words bothered me.	Nanso, ne nsɛm no haw me.
Whatever he had to say, he didn't want to say much.	Nea na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka biara no, na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka kɛse.
And when the.	Na bere a.
Don’t be a sinner.	Mma wonyɛ bɔne.
Wear your favorite stylish clothes.	Hyɛ ntade a ɛyɛ fɛ a w’ani gye ho.
I can’t work.	Mintumi nyɛ adwuma.
We can’t do the city now.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ kurow no mprempren.
So much happiness.	Anigye pii saa.
That is obviously not possible.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Start with today.	Fi ase fi nnɛ.
I hoped to do whatever he wanted.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ mɛyɛ biribiara a ɔpɛ.
Money, itself, is nothing more than a passive object.	Sika, ankasa, nyɛ hwee sɛ ade a ɛnyɛ adwuma.
There is no one like us.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔte sɛ yɛn.
And you don’t either.	Na wo nso wonyɛ saa.
This doesn’t seem like a daunting task on the surface.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi nyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den wɔ anim.
I also love this time of year.	M’ani gye afe no mu bere yi nso ho.
Where are they ever ?.	Ɛhe na wɔyɛ da ?.
Tell me how you like them.	Ka sɛnea w’ani gye wɔn ho kyerɛ me.
For important information, it is not.	Wɔ nsɛm a ɛho hia ho no, ɛnte saa.
But you can see it.	Nanso wubetumi ahu.
This is not a problem at all.	Eyi nyɛ ɔhaw koraa.
Or maybe it was in his car.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɛyɛ ne kar no mu.
So here he is today.	Enti ha na ɔwɔ nnɛ.
Dad always took us to school.	Papa de yɛn kɔ sukuu bere nyinaa.
I was good at that.	Ná me ho akokwaw wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
But it’s not like you.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛ mo.
None of us wanted them.	Ná yɛn mu biara mpɛ wɔn.
I think we have a great team.	Misusuw sɛ yɛwɔ kuw kɛse bi.
None of this happened.	Eyi mu biara amma mu.
People you knew about.	Nnipa a na wunim wɔn ho asɛm.
It’s weird for me too.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ma me nso.
He was very innocent.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho nni asɛm yiye.
My mind doesn’t work like that.	M’adwene nyɛ adwuma saa.
After that, head back.	Ɛno akyi no, fa w’ani kyerɛ akyi.
It would have been much better if we had spent more years together.	Sɛ yɛde mfe pii bɔɔ mu a, anka ɛbɛyɛ papa kɛse.
Consider many of the arrangements.	Susuw nhyehyɛe no pii ho hwɛ.
His mother, his father.	Ne maame, ne papa.
Keep their mouths shut.	Ma wɔn ano nyɛ den.
Terrible things are happening.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ hu rekɔ so.
Never enough money for them.	Sika a ɛdɔɔso mma wɔn da.
He was a danger.	Ná ɔyɛ asiane.
A road leads to his house.	Ɔkwan bi fa ne fie.
Good is stronger than evil.	Papa ho yɛ den sen bɔne.
He wanted to do the same thing.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ade koro no ara.
For now, I just don't care.	Mprempren de, ɛnyɛ me asɛm kɛkɛ.
Can anyone help me please.	So obi betumi aboa me mesrɛ wo.
The city is crowded today.	Nnipa ahyɛ kurow no mu ma nnɛ.
This incident just happened.	Saa asɛm yi sii ara kwa.
And just remember, you’re growing.	Na kae kɛkɛ sɛ, woreyɛ kɛse.
This was completely untrue.	Ná eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
I really meant it too.	Ná me nso mepɛ sɛ meka ankasa.
You weren’t a child.	Na wonyɛ abofra.
But something had gone wrong.	Nanso na biribi anyɛ yiye.
There is plenty of it.	Ɛdɔɔso wɔ hɔ.
Not surprising there.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa wɔ hɔ.
The latter is our favorite.	Nea etwa to no ne nea yɛn ani gye ho kɛse.
It has the same size as the input images.	Ɛwɔ ne kɛse te sɛ mfonini ahorow a wɔde hyɛ mu no.
He had a few.	Ná ɔwɔ kakraa bi.
This was obviously very much about him.	Ɛda adi sɛ na eyi fa ne ho kɛse.
This was no accident.	Ná eyi nyɛ akwanhyia.
And something else.	Na biribi aka.
Schools are a product.	Sukuu ahorow yɛ ade a wɔde yɛ nneɛma.
It was not a pleasant time.	Ná ɛnyɛ bere a ɛyɛ anigye.
We will do it that day.	Yɛbɛyɛ no saa da no.
Remove the hat.	Yi kyɛw no.
This gets old fast.	Eyi yɛ dedaw ntɛmntɛm.
All that one needs.	Nea obi hia nyinaa.
I don’t like it out there.	M’ani nnye ho wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
That was a little scary.	Ná ɛno yɛ hu kakra.
But that’s not the whole story.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no nyinaa.
I knew nothing of my animal nature.	Ná minnim me mmoa su ho hwee.
I thought he could play.	Misusuwii sɛ obetumi adi agoru.
Or don’t do it.	Anaasɛ nyɛ saa.
He would go.	Ná ɔbɛkɔ.
I don’t know why that is.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Again, it’s not a problem.	Bio nso, ɛnyɛ ɔhaw.
It’s the morning of the latter.	Ɛyɛ ade a etwa to no anɔpa.
Tonight itself.	Anadwo yi ara.
That’s how things worked out.	Saa ara na nneɛma faa so yɛɛ adwuma.
But that is the past and this is the present.	Nanso ɛno ne bere a atwam na eyi ne mprempren.
They are very dangerous.	Wɔyɛ asiane kɛse.
There were a few people inside.	Ná nnipa kakraa bi wɔ mu.
Get to know every person.	Hu onipa biara.
Who was the man who came home with her?	Hena ne ɔbarima a ɔne no baa fie no?
It’s just amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
For curriculum.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a adesua nhyehyɛe.
Her apartment was very comfortable.	Ná ne dan no mu yɛ fɛ yiye.
You'll get out.	Wo ma fi adi.
Their children don’t like them.	Wɔn mma ani nnye wɔn ho.
I did most of the work.	Meyɛɛ adwuma no fã kɛse no ara.
That’s what mattered.	Ɛno ne nea na ɛho hia.
But it’s not you.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wo.
We are a great team.	Yɛyɛ kuw kɛse bi.
The end of it all.	Ne nyinaa awiei.
I believe it exists.	Migye di sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
What really happened.	Nea esii ankasa.
She patted her happy dog’s leg.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne kraman a ɔwɔ anigye no nan mu.
I think the situation was much more complicated than that.	Misusuw sɛ na tebea no mu yɛ den sen saa koraa.
In any case, make no mistake.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, nni mfomso biara.
Maybe someone will say something.	Ebia obi bɛka biribi.
None of us can do that.	Yɛn mu biara ntumi nyɛ saa.
They were simple, but beautiful.	Ná wɔn ho nyɛ den, nanso na ɛyɛ fɛ.
I knew him well.	Ná minim no yiye.
It was obviously a problem.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛyɛ ɔhaw.
Not in that way.	Ɛnyɛ saa kwan no so.
I had enough weakness before.	Ná mewɔ mmerɛw a ɛdɔɔso pɛn.
It was more difficult than that.	Ná ɛyɛ den sen saa.
It is not so.	Ɛnte saa.
That’s all that matters to me.	Ɛno nkutoo ne nea ɛho hia me.
We hope for the best.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ nea eye sen biara bɛba.
And there are other things.	Na nneɛma foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
It still works.	Ɛda so ara yɛ adwuma.
Later that year.	Akyiri yi wɔ saa afe no mu.
But it seemed to be the case.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
The danger was more like that.	Ná asiane no te sɛ ɛno kɛse.
All good things must come to an end.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma pa nyinaa ba awiei.
Your clothes are wet.	Wo ntade ayɛ nsu.
I knew he must be a child.	Ná minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔyɛ abofra.
Don’t thank me.	Mma meda me ase.
That was the last thing he said to her.	Ɛno ne asɛm a etwa to a ɔka kyerɛɛ no.
You will tell me yours.	Wobɛka wo deɛ akyerɛ me.
He says they have to be organized.	Ɔka sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe.
I thought so anyway.	Misusuwii saa ɔkwan biara so.
This week and next.	Dapɛn yi ne nea edi hɔ no.
This is the very strange one.	Eyi ne nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
The dog had forgotten that there was danger.	Ná ɔkraman no werɛ afi sɛ asiane bi wɔ hɔ.
The last of the lot.	Nea etwa to koraa.
But I'm not.	Nanso me de.
I don’t know what to do.	Me ntumi nhu nea menyɛ.
Check the table with food.	Fa aduan hwɛ pon no so.
He seemed to like the house very much.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye ofie no ho yiye.
Everyone knows the truth.	Obiara nim nokware no.
We can just come here.	Yebetumi aba ha ara kwa.
What is he doing now? 	Dɛn na ɔreyɛ mprempren?
That is the end of the letter.	Ɛno ne krataa no awiei.
A new one begins.	Foforo bi fi ase.
I have the plan.	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe no.
The problems seem very interesting.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔhaw ahorow no yɛ anigye kɛse.
You might like that one too.	Ebia w’ani begye saa biako no nso ho.
He ran toward her.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ ne nkyɛn.
And every user has one.	Na obiara a ɔde di dwuma no wɔ bi.
This isn’t any good.	Eyi nyɛ papa biara.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɛyɛ bere ho asɛm ara kwa.
That all worked really well.	Ɛno nyinaa yɛɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
He looked at her with interest.	Ɔde anigye hwɛɛ no.
He gives the.	Ɔde di.
It was over in sex.	Ná aba awiei wɔ nna mu.
Very good content.	Nsɛm a ɛwɔ mu a eye paa.
There was only one thing for sure.	Ade biako pɛ na na ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ nokware.
There was no desire.	Ná ɔpɛ biara nni hɔ.
It seemed like a good idea.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwene pa.
Look at the characteristics.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛte no.
One other point, too.	Nsɛm foforo biako nso.
I couldn’t even believe it.	Ná mintumi nnye nni mpo.
Throughout the house.	Wɔ ofie no nyinaa mu.
No work is necessary.	Adwuma biara ho nhia.
I just can’t do that.	Mintumi nyɛ saa ara kwa.
Not just the head.	Ɛnyɛ ti no nkutoo.
I see it every day.	Mihu no da biara da.
It’s pretty cool, after all.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye, ne nyinaa akyi no.
Make yourself feel good.	Ma wo ho nte nka.
If you have that, you have more.	Sɛ wowɔ saa a, wowɔ pii.
That’s what they do best.	Ɛno ne nea wɔyɛ no yiye.
For the most part, it works well.	Wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu no, ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
None of them are perfect.	Wɔn mu biara nyɛ pɛ.
I definitely enjoyed that meal a lot.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ m’ani gyee saa aduan no ho yiye.
He does a good job.	Ɔyɛ adwuma pa.
Their lives were always in danger.	Ná wɔn nkwa da asiane mu bere nyinaa.
Do what you can.	Yɛ nea wubetumi.
The current grew stronger.	Mprempren no mu yɛɛ den kɛse.
But he had no idea how much time he had.	Nanso na onni bere dodow a ɔwɔ ho adwene biara.
He was left with nothing.	Ná aka no a na onni hwee.
A lot of people have created that, and it works.	Nnipa pii abɔ saa, na ɛyɛ adwuma.
I didn’t want to deal with those people.	Ná mempɛ sɛ me ne saa nkurɔfo no bedi nsɛm.
A long time ago .	Bere tenten a atwam ni .
I don’t want to hear about this again.	Mempɛ sɛ mete eyi ho asɛm bio.
Not at this time.	Ɛnyɛ saa bere yi mu.
What follows is unclear.	Nea edi hɔ no mu nna hɔ.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
You can make that mistake.	Wubetumi adi mfomso saa.
He may not even exist.	Ebia na onni hɔ mpo.
But that’s not what happened here.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na esii wɔ ha.
It was a long time ago.	Ɛyɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
I love books a lot.	M’ani gye nhoma ho kɛse.
The cold finally got the better of me.	Awiei koraa no, awɔw no nyaa me so nkonim.
There must be something he can do to help his friends.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a obetumi ayɛ de aboa ne nnamfo.
In this manner.	Wɔ saa ɔkwan yi so.
I got a little involved.	Mede me ho hyɛɛ mu kakra.
She's really nice.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
I thought it was great.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse.
So that’s why it’s there.	Enti ɛno nti na ɛwɔ hɔ no.
This is their right.	Eyi ne wɔn hokwan.
However, people tend to work as if the road map is real.	Nanso, nkurɔfo taa yɛ adwuma te sɛ nea ɔkwan no ho mfonini no yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
All that matters is the child he can be.	Nea ɛho hia ara ne abofra a obetumi ayɛ no.
Nothing is just a rumor.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ asɛm bi kɛkɛ.
This was his bad day.	Ná eyi ne ne da bɔne.
She was really beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
I will go with any money.	Mede sika biara bɛkɔ.
And so it has been.	Na saa na ayɛ.
And something else.	Na biribi foforo nso.
We used to be best friends.	Kan no na yɛyɛ nnamfo paa.
He pretended to be a man.	Ɔyɛɛ ne ho sɛ onipa.
I did that for many years.	Meyɛɛ saa mfe pii.
If you want me to do that, I will.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ meyɛ saa a, mɛyɛ saa.
It seems strange to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ma me.
However, it didn’t matter that day.	Nanso, na ɛho nhia saa da no.
False, it is not.	Atoro, ɛnte saa.
But we have two things in common.	Nanso yɛwɔ nneɛma abien a ɛyɛ pɛ.
And that would happen in any group.	Na anka ɛno bɛba wɔ kuw biara mu.
The whole team is here.	Kuw no nyinaa wɔ ha.
Check it out .	Hwɛ no .
I’m in love with them.	M’ani gye wɔn ho.
I headed downstairs.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ fam.
But this doesn’t really mean much.	Nanso eyi nkyerɛ pii ankasa.
This is much bigger than us.	Eyi yɛ kɛse sen yɛn koraa.
You know when.	Wunim bere a.
This is what they were told.	Eyi ne nea wɔka kyerɛɛ wɔn.
Here are the inputs used.	Nsɛm a wɔde hyɛɛ mu a wɔde dii dwuma no ni.
Stay in the moment, each and every moment.	Tra hɔ wɔ bere no mu, bere biara ne bere biara mu.
He might even say some things.	Ebia na ɔbɛka nsɛm bi mpo.
No one could touch his pictures.	Obiara antumi mfa ne nsa nka ne mfonini ahorow no.
He had a job, and he looked like that.	Ná ɔwɔ adwuma bi, na na ɔte sɛ saa.
It was a thought of it.	Ná ɛyɛ ho adwene.
Either way you have a plan.	Ɔkwan biara so no wowɔ nhyehyɛe bi.
Just in a different way.	Wɔ ɔkwan foforo so ara kwa.
I can put on that.	Metumi de ahyɛ saa asɛm no so.
At that point the situation didn’t matter.	Saa bere no na tebea no ho nhia.
It’s not about work.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma ho asɛm.
He had a very good shot from the point.	Na ɔwɔ tuo a eye paa fi asɛm no so.
Or it was the case.	Anaasɛ na ɛte saa.
You can deal with that.	Wubetumi adi saa asɛm no ho dwuma.
More and more, this no longer seems to be the case.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛte sɛ nea eyi nte saa bio.
I hope you enjoy it!.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho!.
With no problems at all.	A ɔhaw biara nni ho koraa.
That’s something people don’t see.	Ɛno yɛ biribi a nkurɔfo nhu.
I think most of us would like that too.	Misusuw sɛ yɛn mu dodow no ara nso bɛpɛ saa.
But that’s the best we can do right now.	Nanso ɛno ne nea eye sen biara a yebetumi ayɛ mprempren.
I am not any of these things.	Menyɛ saa nneɛma yi mu biara.
It was a small rent, which is amazing.	Na ɛyɛ dan ka kakraa bi, a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It is full of learning.	Adesua ahyɛ mu ma.
You don’t need to say anything.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wobɛka asɛm biara.
Over and over and over again.	Mpɛn pii ne mpɛn pii.
Believe me.	Gye me di.
Something went wrong.	Biribi anyɛ yiye.
One person can.	Onipa biako betumi.
But it is good at night.	Nanso eye anadwo.
This road is in excellent condition.	Saa kwan yi wɔ tebea pa mu.
That was about me.	Ná ɛno fa me ho.
It doesn’t feel like it was me doing that.	Ɛnte nka sɛ ɛyɛ me na na mereyɛ saa ade no.
He was just sitting there.	Ná ɔte hɔ ara kwa.
Not surprising at all.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa koraa.
There was still much work to be done.	Na adwuma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He stroked his hair.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne ti nhwi so.
There must be more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ pii wɔ hɔ.
We can’t do this, and we don’t need to.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ eyi, na ɛho nhia nso.
However, do not mention that in the article.	Nanso, nka saa asɛm no wɔ asɛm no mu.
His time will come.	Ne bere bɛba.
For a long time too.	Bere tenten bi nso.
It was solid for the most part.	Ná ɛyɛ den wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu.
I don’t want to be here.	Mempɛ sɛ mewɔ ha.
I just felt like I mattered.	Ná mete nka sɛ me ho hia me ara kwa.
Only two studies can be mentioned here.	Yebetumi aka adesua ahorow abien pɛ wɔ ha.
Almost everyone.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara.
I don’t know anything else.	Minnim biribi foforo biara.
This is the opportunity we have.	Eyi ne hokwan a yɛwɔ.
It was you, and you wanted me more than anyone else.	Na ɛyɛ wo, na wopɛ me sen obiara.
But that seems too difficult.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ den dodo.
That had to go away.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno kɔ.
But it was always just as painful.	Nanso na ɛyɛ yaw saa ara bere nyinaa.
This is like a foot insert.	Eyi te sɛ nan a wɔde hyɛ mu.
However, I’m interested.	Nanso, m’ani gye ho.
You don’t have to do this.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi.
Maybe he can find something for me.	Ebia obetumi anya biribi ama me.
He was short-sighted.	Ná ɔyɛ tiaa.
Interesting things do come out of that.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye fi saa asɛm no mu ba ampa.
And look at their faces.	Na hwɛ wɔn anim.
You wanted everyone to be happy.	Ná wopɛ sɛ obiara ani gye.
I think that would be a problem.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ ɔhaw.
Water is water.	Nsu yɛ nsu.
He was amazed.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​nwonwa.
That will play a big role.	Ɛno bedi dwuma kɛse.
I would really appreciate any help.	M’ani begye mmoa biara ho ankasa.
There was nothing wrong with it.	Na mfomso biara nni ho.
I want to be beautiful.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ fɛ.
That’s pretty much what it’s been.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ne nea ayɛ.
What you have done is wrong.	Nea woayɛ no yɛ bɔne.
The time of year didn’t hurt either.	Afe no mu bere nso anyɛ yaw.
The dog was playful.	Ná ɔkraman no di agoru.
And the bus came here.	Na bɔs no baa ha.
It’s past midnight.	Ɛyɛ anadwo fã atwam.
Perhaps for a short time.	Ebia bere tiaa bi.
He was, to me.	Ná ɔyɛ, wɔ me fam.
The sooner the better.	Dodow a ɛyɛ ntɛm no, dodow no ara na eye.
This is not a bad thing.	Eyi nyɛ ade bɔne.
For most, there was plenty left.	Wɔ dodow no ara fam no, na nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a aka.
Maybe you don’t.	Ebia wonyɛ saa.
He's just great.	Ɔyɛ kɛse ara kwa.
I know what it’s like.	Minim sɛnea ɛte.
You already have a story about it.	Wowɔ ho asɛm bi dedaw.
Many of them have children.	Wɔn mu pii wɔ mma.
It’s not necessarily dangerous, though.	Ɛnyɛ nea asiane wom ankasa, nanso.
It’s not really bad.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne ankasa.
Take some time for yourself.	Gye bere kakra ma wo ho.
Everything about sex.	Biribiara fa nna ho.
He told you so you could tell me.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ wo sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wubetumi aka akyerɛ me.
Let him have a look.	Ma no hwɛ.
Many factors are involved.	Nneɛma pii di dwuma.
That was just a short prospective test.	Ná ɛno yɛ sɔhwɛ a wɔde hwɛ kwan tiaa bi kɛkɛ.
Quick, track that one!	Ntɛmntɛm, di saa biako no akyi!
Someone starts on it.	Obi fi ase wɔ so.
What might that look like?.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ dɛn?.
In a way, it was.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na ɛte saa.
To take advantage of this opportunity, you must hurry.	Sɛ wubetumi de hokwan yi adi dwuma a, ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ntɛm.
A homeless man lies on the sidewalk.	Ɔbarima bi a onni ofie da kwan ho.
You can get them.	Wubetumi anya wɔn.
It was too easy, this.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo, eyi.
This path did not show me.	Saa kwan yi ankyerɛ me.
We do a lot there.	Yɛyɛ pii wɔ hɔ.
The desire he has for it.	Ɔpɛ a ɔwɔ wɔ ho no.
We have to do that job.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa adwuma no.
But it is something difficult.	Nanso ɛyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ den.
Their meeting ended badly.	Wɔn nhyiam no baa awiei bɔne.
So much could have happened during that time.	Enti na nneɛma pii betumi asi wɔ saa bere no mu.
There was no need to say much more.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ wɔka pii bio.
Work should be work and home should be home.	Ɛsɛ sɛ adwuma yɛ adwuma na ofie yɛ ofie.
Just look at it.	Hwɛ no kɛkɛ.
This can also work very well.	Eyi nso betumi ayɛ adwuma yiye paa.
He had some problems before.	Ná ɔwɔ ɔhaw ahorow bi pɛn.
That book was inexpensive.	Ná saa nhoma no bo nyɛ den.
Wisdom gives us the ability to think for ourselves.	Nyansa ma yɛn ankasa tumi susuw nneɛma ho.
We will do our best with what we have been given.	Yɛde nea wɔde ama yɛn no bɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara.
We both moved to a bigger city the following year.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa tu kɔɔ kurow kɛse bi mu afe a edi hɔ no.
Wonderful pictures.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
At this point, you don’t need to do anything about it.	Saa bere yi de, enhia sɛ woyɛ ho biribi.
If it works, it’s a good idea.	Sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a, ɛyɛ adwene pa.
I didn’t know what it was.	Ná minnim nea ɛyɛ.
And he enjoyed the long days.	Na n’ani gyee nna tenten no ho.
Don’t be afraid!	Mma w’ani nnye ho!
This recently.	Eyi nnansa yi ara.
He never wanted to do that.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa da.
The risk to life was high.	Ná asiane a ɛwɔ nkwa mu no yɛ kɛse.
And also again.	Na nso bio.
He does plan on making another one at some point.	Ɔyɛ nhyehyɛe ampa sɛ ɔbɛyɛ foforo wɔ bere bi mu.
Share your problems with us.	Ka wo haw ahorow kyerɛ yɛn.
None of these things have worked.	Saa nneɛma yi mu biara nyɛɛ adwuma.
He had enough problems with books.	Ná ɔwɔ nhoma ho haw a ɛdɔɔso.
He does nothing for me anymore.	Ɔnyɛ hwee mma me bio.
I want you to post his thoughts.	Mepɛ sɛ wode n’adwene to hɔ.
Or so it is.	Anaasɛ ɛte saa.
It’s a test.	Ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ.
Of good days and bad days.	Nna pa ne nna bɔne ho.
If available as possible.	Sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ a sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
I’m interested in stories.	M’ani gye nsɛm ho.
It was not a good picture.	Ná ɛnyɛ mfonini pa.
There was no question about that.	Ná saa asɛm no ho asɛm biara nni ho.
But two things seem clear.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea nneɛma abien mu da hɔ.
The same is true for you.	Saa ara na ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Maybe he lives in his.	Ebia ɔno na ɔte ne de mu.
I could never see it.	Ná mintumi nhu da.
They liked the idea.	Wɔn ani gyee adwene no ho.
And he gave it to them.	Na ɔde maa wɔn.
For most people.	Wɔ nnipa dodow no ara fam.
He didn’t want us to.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Once popular, this group is now on the decline.	Bere bi na nkurɔfo ani gye ho, na mprempren kuw yi rekɔ fam.
I am a human being.	Meyɛ onipa.
Head was power.	Ná ti yɛ tumi.
I’m very proud of my school.	M’ani agye me sukuu ho yiye.
I don’t care how bad it is.	Sɛnea ɛyɛ bɔne no mfa me ho.
I didn’t want to do that.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
I need to see you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu wo.
I'm pretty nervous, but he scares me.	Me ho yɛ hu yiye, nanso ɔbɔ me hu.
It lives in the garage.	Ɛte kar dan mu.
It’s better that way.	Ɛyɛ papa saa kwan no so.
This happened last week.	Eyi sii dapɛn a etwaam no.
I just have no idea where to go from here.	Minni baabi a mɛkɔ afi ha ho adwene biara kɛkɛ.
That you have to admit it.	Sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wugye tom.
I was surprised by the few things there.	Nneɛma kakraa bi a ɛwɔ hɔ no maa me ho dwiriw me.
Most of us are really nice people.	Yɛn mu dodow no ara yɛ nnipa a yɛn ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
I can’t go to him.	Mintumi nkɔ ne nkyɛn.
A hot summer day.	Awɔw bere mu da a ɛyɛ hyew.
Maybe we can go there a little more often.	Ebia yebetumi akɔ hɔ kakra mpɛn pii.
He made a statement on the spot.	Ɔyɛɛ asɛm bi wɔ hɔ ara.
This is the end of it.	Eyi ne awiei no.
This was not the work of any animal.	Ná eyi nyɛ aboa biara adwuma.
There was no bottom.	Ná ase biara nni hɔ.
And this is just that.	Na eyi yɛ saa ara.
I've been down.	Me abɔ ase.
People move things.	Nkurɔfo tu nneɛma.
Maybe it’s not.	Ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
I will add a few things soon.          	Mede nneɛma kakraa bi bɛka ho nnansa yi ara.          
Nothing went wrong.	Biribiara anyɛ yiye.
That’s pretty much it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ne no.
I will still do that.	Meda so ara bɛyɛ saa.
So tell the whole story.	Enti ka asɛm no nyinaa.
I think it’s wonderful.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There is limited space available.	Baabi a ɛwɔ hɔ kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Not the smartest idea.	Ɛnyɛ adwene a nyansa wom sen biara.
You can’t do that.	Worentumi nyɛ saa.
He came home with a terrible idea.	Ɔde adwene a ɛyɛ hu baa fie.
There is a reason for that.	Ɛwɔ nea enti a ɛte saa.
We do it a lot.	Yɛyɛ no pii.
They talk about it in the game.	Wɔka ho asɛm wɔ agoru no mu.
You can’t handle it all.	Worentumi nni ne nyinaa ho dwuma.
chill.	gye w'ani.
In a sense, though, the situation is more complicated.	Nanso, ɔkwan bi so no, tebea no mu yɛ den kɛse.
I have been doing that for two years.	Meyɛ saa mfe abien ni.
That tells you how amazing this is.	Ɛno kyerɛ wo sɛnea eyi yɛ nwonwa no.
That is certainly true.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
This would be his room.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ ne dan.
This is true today more than ever.	Eyi te saa nnɛ sen bere biara.
He’s enjoyed it.	N’ani gyee ho.
So a good thing to do.	Enti ade pa bi a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
But it will be expensive.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛho ka yɛ den.
Easier said than done, you could say.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobɛka sen sɛ wobɛyɛ, wubetumi aka.
This system is not easy to implement.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi nyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma.
We will definitely use it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ yɛde bedi dwuma.
There is usually enough food in my house.	Mpɛn pii no, aduan a ɛdɔɔso wɔ me fie.
You don’t have to talk to that guy.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wo ne saa ɔbarima no kasa.
Or the car.	Anaasɛ kar no.
These things are very important.	Saa nneɛma yi ho hia kɛse.
She is also very beautiful.	Ɔno nso yɛ fɛ yiye.
There are many people.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ.
The news shocked everyone.	Asɛm no maa obiara ho dwiriw no.
Clearly, the issue was one of power.	Ɛda adi sɛ na asɛm no fa tumi ho.
This is a realistic one.	Eyi yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Work is put aside in an important game.	Wɔde adwuma to nkyɛn wɔ agoru bi a ɛho hia mu.
I had brought this up.	Ná mede eyi aba.
It was too late, too late.	Ná aka akyi dodo, na aka akyi dodo.
I didn’t think he would tell me.	Na minsusuw sɛ ɔbɛka akyerɛ me.
However, it doesn’t matter.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ hwee.
Now it is too late.	Seesei aka akyi dodo.
That’s part of what’s going on here.	Ɛno ka nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha no ho.
I know this for sure.	Minim eyi ankasa.
But there were some really interesting things on film.	Nanso na nneɛma bi a ɛyɛ anigye ankasa wɔ sini mu.
It has a place in the house.	Ɛwɔ baabi wɔ fie hɔ.
But it was also terrifying.	Nanso na ɛyɛ hu nso.
Nothing did anything.	Biribiara anyɛ biribi.
I think it does.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
So be careful!	Enti hwɛ yiye!
Everyone went really, really well.	Obiara kɔɔ so yiye ankasa, ankasa.
If you liked the first book, that’s just fine.	Sɛ w’ani gyee nhoma a edi kan no ho a, ɛno ara na ɛyɛ yiye.
Look at that squirrel!	Hwɛ saa ɔkraman no!
It was always there.	Ná ɛwɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
He uses power money.	Ɔde tumi sika na ɛyɛ adwuma.
This would do two things.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ nneɛma abien.
Or it’s not really true.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa.
But the truth is more complicated than that.	Nanso nokware no mu yɛ den sen saa.
There is a.	Ɛwɔ hɔ.
You just can’t do anything with it.	Worentumi mfa nyɛ hwee kɛkɛ.
He had enough hope for two.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso a ɛdɔɔso ma nnipa baanu.
He does something he wants to do.	Ɔyɛ biribi a ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
But I have no musical education.	Nanso minni nnwom ho adesua biara.
You are no longer a part of yourself.	Wonyɛ wo ho fã bio.
Better is possible.	Nea eye sen saa betumi aba.
It will be difficult.	Ɛbɛyɛ den.
He was, he was.	Ná ɔyɛ, ɔte saa.
That’s it, easy and time-saving.	Ɛno ne no, ɛnyɛ den na ɛnyɛ bere pii.
He stepped in front of the car.	Ɔde ne nan sii kar no anim.
A moment please.	Bere tiaa bi mesrɛ wo.
But it must be done!.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ!.
I wanted to do that with him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne no yɛ saa.
Definitely our plan to deliver on time, every time.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ yɛn nhyehyɛe a yɛde bɛma wɔ bere ano, bere biara.
It’s like this.	Ɛte sɛ eyi.
Your mother told me about the party.	Wo maame kaa apontow no ho asɛm kyerɛɛ me.
Just let it be that way.	Ma ɛnyɛ saa ara kwa.
The idea wasn’t really new.	Na adwene no nyɛ ade foforo ankasa.
Why, he didn’t know.	Dɛn nti, na onnim.
Give them to him.	Fa wɔn ma no.
The same is true in the present situation.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ mprempren tebea no mu.
Just look at you.	Hwɛ wo kɛkɛ.
I have a lot to say about it.	Mewɔ pii ka ho asɛm.
Don’t be that guy.	Mma wonyɛ saa ɔbarima no.
Or take it out of it.	Anaasɛ yi no fi mu.
But they are not happy.	Nanso wɔn ani nnye.
Use it wisely in every situation.	Fa di dwuma yiye wɔ tebea biara mu.
Take about it.	Fa ho asɛm.
It’s really easy.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
That’s a wonderful environment to work in.	Ɛno yɛ tebea a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma wom.
Maybe it’s too hard.	Ebia ɛyɛ den dodo.
One can only hope!.	Obi betumi anya anidaso!.
But that is a whole other story.	Nanso ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo koraa.
I am looking forward to this very much.	Mehwɛ eyi kwan kɛse.
What a thought this is.	Adwene bɛn ara ni.
Such music is now very common.	Mprempren nnwom a ɛte saa no abu so kɛse.
You seem to know a lot about that girl.	Ɛte sɛ nea wunim saa abeawa no ho nsɛm pii.
I am with you to the end.	Me ne wo wɔ hɔ de besi awiei.
He has so many books.	Ɔwɔ nhoma pii saa.
This is a job.	Eyi yɛ adwuma.
They will get better when they are involved.	Wɔn ho bɛtɔ wɔn bere a wɔde wɔn ho ahyɛ mu no.
The mood was not good.	Ná adwene no nyɛ papa.
How exciting it is!	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ anigye!
But you can see too much.	Nanso wubetumi ahu nneɛma pii dodo.
It wasn't as hard as he thought it would be.	Ná ɛnyɛ den sɛnea na osusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ no.
He knew himself too well.	Ná onim ne ho yiye dodo.
We spend our whole lives working like that.	Yɛde yɛn nkwa nna nyinaa yɛ adwuma saa.
The innocent of the test was shocked.	Nea ne ho nni asɛm wɔ sɔhwɛ no mu no ho dwiriw no.
That is very difficult for me.	Ɛno yɛ den ma me paa.
They seemed really happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani agye ankasa.
What is less common.	Dɛn na ɛnyɛ nea abu so kɛse.
Strange things are happening.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa rekɔ so.
At that point there was still nothing.	Saa bere no na biribiara da so ara nni hɔ.
Everyone has an opinion on how you should do it.	Obiara wɔ n’adwene wɔ sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no ho.
We had a lot of power.	Ná yɛwɔ tumi kɛse.
I am not good at all.	Menyɛ papa koraa.
I can see why that is.	Metumi ahu nea enti a ɛte saa.
But only for now.	Nanso mprempren de nkutoo.
This made my mind much easier.	Eyi maa m’adwene yɛɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
I don’t think much of his friends.	Minsusuw ne nnamfo ho pii.
He had no intention of doing so.	Ná ɔnyɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
The following winter.	Awɔw bere a edi hɔ no.
I was not much help to the police.	Ná menyɛ mmoa kɛse mma polisifo.
He has good days and bad days.	Ɔwɔ nna pa ne nna bɔne.
We liked it, but it wasn’t us.	Yɛn ani gyee ho, nanso na ɛnyɛ yɛn.
I’m worried about myself.	Me ho asɛm haw me.
He wanted to make this film.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ sini yi.
I can’t do that then.	Mintumi nyɛ saa saa bere no.
There’s something about him that’s dangerous.	Biribi wɔ ne ho a ɛyɛ hu.
There has to be something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ.
Few details of the accident are available at this time.	Akwanhyia no ho nsɛm kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ saa bere yi.
He’s just a kid.	Ɔyɛ abofra ara kwa.
Another time and he nodded again.	Bere foforo na ɔde ne ti too fam bio.
They didn’t have to be friends.	Ná enhia sɛ wɔyɛ nnamfo.
Go for a much faster walk.	Kɔ ntɛmntɛm kɛse nantew.
There was nothing remarkable.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
But this is great for kids.	Nanso eyi yɛ kɛse ma mmofra.
Your dog lies by the door.	Wo kraman no da ɔpon no ho.
But there were your kids.	Nanso na mo mmofra wɔ hɔ.
And it probably still is.	Na ebia ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
I heard him too.	Me nso metee sɛ ɔno nso.
But beautiful and good.	Nanso fɛ na eye.
But there was no doubt anymore.	Nanso na akyinnye biara nni ho bio.
I can hardly believe my eyes.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nnye m’ani nni.
You think she is beautiful.	Wususuw sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Just another thing.	Ade foforo bi kɛkɛ.
Less people, more ideas.	Nnipa kakraa bi, adwene pii.
To be with him.	Sɛ́ wobɛka ne ho.
He was the one who did it.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ saa.
Never doubt it.	Mma ho kyim da.
It does look beautiful.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ ampa.
A good variety of things.	Nneɛma ahorow ahorow a eye.
I told him that it would.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
He is great and has a presence on the field.	Ɔyɛ kɛse na ɔwɔ baabi a ɔwɔ wɔ abɔnten so.
He does the same thing.	Ɔno nso yɛ saa ara.
One time to retrieve, another to show.	Bere bi a wɔde begye no, foforo de akyerɛ.
He had nowhere else to go.	Ná onni baabi foforo biara.
The two of them looked down.	Wɔn baanu no hwɛɛ fam hɔ.
It was neither night nor day.	Ná ɛnyɛ anadwo anaa awia.
They gave him the whole movie.	Wɔde sini no nyinaa maa no.
I was pretty good at it.	Ná me ho akokwaw yiye wɔ mu.
I found the story.	Mihuu asɛm no.
I absolutely love this product.	M’ani gye saa ade yi ho koraa.
The prices were terrible.	Ná nneɛma bo yɛ hu.
I was pretty nervous at the time.	Ná me ho ayɛ me hyew yiye saa bere no.
The only information we can get from him is his name.	Nsɛm biako pɛ a yebetumi anya afi ne hɔ ne din.
I will feel better now.	Me ho bɛtɔ me mprempren.
That is absolutely true.	Ɛno yɛ nokware koraa.
I wonder if this will be me soon.	Misusuw sɛ ebia eyi bɛyɛ me nnansa yi ara anaa.
There has to be a better way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ.
It’s too expensive.	Ɛyɛ nea ne bo yɛ den dodo.
You don’t want that to happen, obviously.	Wompɛ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa, ɛda adi sɛ.
There can be dangerous consequences.	Asiane betumi afi mu aba.
This is a powerful one.	Eyi yɛ nea tumi wom.
That is a serious mistake.	Ɛno yɛ mfomso kɛse.
Their story is our story.	Wɔn asɛm no yɛ yɛn asɛm.
However, that day is not today.	Nanso, saa da no nyɛ nnɛ.
I showed him my picture.	Mede me mfonini kyerɛɛ no.
But that is the only thing that comes with time.	Nanso ɛno nkutoo ne ade a bere de ba.
Different materials are used on the products.	Wɔde nneɛma ahorow di dwuma wɔ nneɛma a wɔyɛ no so.
They work for me.	Wɔyɛ adwuma ma me.
He gave her a slap in the face.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ no.
Happy, please, this way.	Anigye, mesrɛ wo, saa kwan yi so.
It’s here right now.	Ɛwɔ ha mprempren ara.
It’s either this or nothing.	Ɛyɛ eyi anaasɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
The concept was surprisingly simple.	Ná adwene no yɛ mmerɛw wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
The music was playing, but the room was empty.	Ná nnwom no rebɔ, nanso na hwee nni dan no mu.
Maybe it was going too far.	Ebia na ɛrekɔ akyiri dodo.
You just lay down a lot.	Wode wo ho to fam pii kɛkɛ.
There is no better way.	Ɔkwan pa biara nni hɔ.
Surely someone knows something.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ obi nim biribi.
The day was beautiful.	Ná ɛda no yɛ fɛ yiye.
Maybe it was more important.	Ebia na ɛho hia kɛse.
I am concerned about people.	Nnipa ho asɛm haw me.
That house means something to you.	Saa fie no kyerɛ biribi ma wo.
However, I don’t know.	Nanso, minnim.
You can only plan so far in these things.	Wubetumi ayɛ nhyehyɛe de besi saa bere yi nkutoo wɔ saa nneɛma yi mu.
They loved the food.	Ná wɔn ani gyee aduan no ho.
Someone who can do this in a short amount of time.	Obi a obetumi ayɛ eyi wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
But the potential was there.	Nanso na tumi a ɛwɔ hɔ no wɔ hɔ.
It is best to use it.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
I set it as a lie.	Mede sii hɔ sɛ atoro.
I have one thing to say.	Mewɔ asɛm biako.
Everyone knew what was most important.	Ná obiara nim nea ɛho hia sen biara.
It may be cold.	Ebia na awɔw wom.
I have nothing to do.	Minni hwee a mɛyɛ.
I understand him.	Mete ne ase.
It is still true today.	Ɛda so ara yɛ nokware nnɛ.
It is important that you be one.	Ɛho hia sɛ woyɛ biako.
The empty one.	Nea hwee nni mu no.
Give the money back.	Fa sika no san ma.
I don’t want to do that anymore either.	Me nso mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa bio.
None of these things exist.	Saa nneɛma yi mu biara nni hɔ.
I don't know how to do that.	Me nnim sɛnea mɛyɛ saa.
It seemed to be a sin.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ bɔne.
Not a good one at this point.	Ɛnyɛ obi a ɔyɛ papa wɔ bere yi mu.
Know when it is.	Hu bere a ɛte saa.
The two had no children.	Ná wɔn baanu no nni mma biara.
The dog lies on the ground.	Ɔkraman no da fam.
I'll get it for you.	Me nsa bɛka ama wo.
He didn’t like that dog.	Ná n’ani nnye saa kraman no ho.
Finally, there is no one left.	Awiei koraa no, obiara nni hɔ bio.
He knew you could do it.	Na onim sɛ wubetumi ayɛ.
You want to treat them the way you want to be treated.	Wopɛ sɛ wo ne wɔn di sɛnea wopɛ sɛ wo ne wɔn di no.
I can't say for sure yet.	Mintumi nka no yiye de besi nnɛ.
Your wife needs new clothes.	Wo yere hia ntade foforo.
His positive attitude warmed her inside.	N’adwene pa no maa ne mu yɛɛ hyew.
Something unlike them.	Biribi a ɛnte sɛ wɔn.
Have fun, kids!.	Momma mo ani nnye ho, mmofra!.
All things are possible now.	Nneɛma nyinaa betumi ayɛ yiye mprempren.
There was another reason.	Ná biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Someone did this for me a long time ago.	Obi yɛɛ eyi maa me bere tenten a atwam ni.
The book is very interesting.	Nhoma no yɛ anigye yiye.
Think about what you want.	Susuw nea wopɛ ho.
And he was doing that.	Na ɔreyɛ saa.
Everyone ever seems to be doing that.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara reyɛ saa da.
The child has many desires.	Abofra no wɔ nneɛma pii a ɔpɛ.
I have a very good idea.	Mewɔ adwene a eye paa.
It’s their job.	Ɛyɛ wɔn adwuma.
This is such an awesome book.	Eyi yɛ nhoma a ɛyɛ hu saa.
Look out the window.	Hwɛ mfɛnsere no so.
Evening is still upon the city.	Anwummere da so ara wɔ kurow no so.
Two policemen immediately arrive.	Polisifo baanu ba ntɛm ara.
It seemed like a good idea.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwene pa.
This guy wants something.	Saa ɔbarima yi pɛ biribi.
He could look at it.	Ná obetumi ahwɛ.
As far as you are concerned, he does not exist.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ wo ho no, onni hɔ.
It was definitely a lot of fun.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛyɛ anigye pii.
I want to get to know you better.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wo yiye.
He put the matter down.	Ɔde asɛm no too hɔ.
He focused on her eyes.	Ɔde n’adwene sii n’ani so.
So, at least approx.	Enti, anyɛ yiye koraa no, bɛyɛ.
It would be great if you could do the same.	Sɛ wubetumi ayɛ saa ara a anka ɛbɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
You are the best.	Wo na woyɛ papa sen biara.
Everyone had a role to play.	Ná obiara wɔ dwuma a odi.
Water consumption is also discussed.	Wɔka nsu a wɔde di dwuma nso ho asɛm.
Something terrible was happening.	Ná biribi a ɛyɛ hu rekɔ so.
I don’t really like it.	M’ani nnye ho ankasa.
A good party.	Apontow pa bi.
The most important thing.	Nea ɛho hia sen biara.
Can you spot the mistakes?	So wubetumi ahu mfomso ahorow no?
I believe in hope.	Migye anidaso di.
Submit.	Fa kɔ.
We work for you.	Yɛyɛ adwuma ma wo.
I have used both for years without any problems.	Mede abien no nyinaa adi dwuma mfe pii a ɔhaw biara nni ho.
His father had lied to him.	Ná ne papa adi atoro akyerɛ no.
He nodded excitedly.	Ɔde anigye bɔɔ ne ti.
But they do.	Nanso wɔyɛ saa.
Be careful with that.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
We have some news to make, about this.	Yɛwɔ nsɛm bi a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ, fa eyi ho.
What is the value of that?	Dɛn ne ɛno?
Everyone knows you are here and knows the real story.	Obiara nim sɛ wowɔ ha na onim asɛm no ankasa.
Always enclose your paper.	Fa wo krataa no hyɛ mu bere nyinaa.
If only something.	Sɛ biribi nkutoo a.
So the timing wasn’t good, that’s all.	Enti na bere no nyɛ papa, ɛno ara ne no.
I barely knew you.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na minnim wo.
Something a little strange about them.	Biribi yɛ nwonwa kakra wɔ wɔn ho.
How long ago it was.	Bere tenten ahe a atwam ni.
And they’re not the only ones.	Na ɛnyɛ wɔn nkutoo na wɔyɛ saa.
No one went under any circumstances.	Obiara ankɔ wɔ tebea biara mu.
It’s never been that way.	Ɛnyɛ saa da.
There was nothing more to do.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ bio.
He has a wonderful quality about him.	Ɔwɔ su bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ne ho.
I had some of it.	Ná mewɔ bi.
Perhaps he did.	Ebia ɔyɛɛ saa.
Everyone uses it.	Obiara de di dwuma.
We’ll be fine.	Yɛbɛyɛ yiye.
You know that’s something like us.	Wunim sɛ ɛno yɛ biribi te sɛ yɛn.
We do a lot of talking about people.	Yɛyɛ nnipa ho nsɛm pii.
He would tell her.	Ná ɔbɛka akyerɛ no.
And we had everything, you know.	Na na yɛwɔ biribiara, wunim.
This is a very important job.	Eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛho hia paa.
You are in trouble.	Wowɔ ɔhaw mu.
The girl has a story.	Abeawa no wɔ asɛm bi.
He had no idea what to do with it.	Ná onni adwene biara wɔ nea ɔde bɛyɛ ho.
This was going on.	Ná eyi rekɔ so.
I've been in trouble for a while.	Mede me ho ahyɛ ɔhaw mu kakra.
That may be our only hope.	Ebia ɛno nkutoo ne yɛn anidaso.
They sat at the table for hours.	Wɔde nnɔnhwerew pii traa pon no so.
The dress doesn’t come out.	Atade no mfi mu.
They all sleep in the same room.	Wɔn nyinaa da dan biako mu.
I will pay close attention from now on.	Mede m’adwene besi so yiye fi mprempren rekɔ.
I was at his house.	Ná mewɔ ne fie.
He told me that.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me saa.
He wants to win right away.	Ɔpɛ sɛ odi nkonim ntɛm ara.
This means two things.	Eyi kyerɛ nneɛma abien.
But there was no time.	Nanso na bere biara nni hɔ.
But he doesn’t, either.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa, nso.
I heard about him.	Metee ne ho asɛm.
People would be there.	Anka nkurɔfo bɛba hɔ.
I can’t take any money.	Mintumi nnye sika biara.
Apparently it didn’t.	Ɛda adi sɛ anyɛ saa.
But that would be a total mistake.	Nanso ɛno bɛyɛ mfomso koraa.
He is young, but very strong.	Ɔyɛ abofra, nanso ne ho yɛ den yiye.
Maybe not the face.	Ebia ɛnyɛ anim.
It was easily my favorite part of the summer.	Ná ɛnyɛ den sɛ na ɛyɛ awɔw bere no fã a m’ani gye ho kɛse.
That would be good.	Ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
I know the information is somewhere.	Minim sɛ nsɛm no wɔ baabi.
That doesn’t seem wrong, does it?	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno nyɛ mfomso, ɛnte saa?
The scenery is amazing.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ nwonwa.
I didn’t need to say that.	Ná enhia sɛ meka saa.
I was terrible at it.	Ná me ho yɛ hu wɔ ho.
The first mode of transportation included a car.	Ná kar ka nneɛma a wɔde fa nnipa a edi kan no ho.
Transparency was critical.	Ná nneɛma a ɛda adi no ho hia kɛse.
Pictures of everyone.	Obiara mfonini ahorow.
I can't 'sleep another night.	Mintumi 'nna anadwo foforo.
He seemed very happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye yiye.
Most of the people he knew believed.	Nnipa a na onim wɔn no mu dodow no ara gye dii.
These two are very close.	Saa baanu yi bɛn wɔn ho yiye.
It is true that.	Ɛyɛ nokware sɛ.
I’m not feeling well.	Me ho nyɛ me den.
He no longer wants to risk human life.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde nnipa nkwa to asiane mu bio.
Study after study shows this to be true.	Adesua akyi adesua kyerɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
So he did the job he was assigned.	Enti ɔyɛɛ adwuma a ɔde hyɛɛ ne nsa no.
If you find it, take it.	Sɛ wuhu a, fa.
I know human nature.	Minim onipa su.
I did the same thing.	Me nso meyɛɛ saa.
A beautiful city.	Kurow a ɛyɛ fɛ.

It was painful, very tender.	Ná ɛyɛ yaw, na ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
They were perfect now.	Ná wɔyɛ pɛ mprempren.
We are human beings too.	Yɛn nso yɛyɛ nnipa.
Only if it works.	Sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma nkutoo a.
This is an opportunity.	Eyi yɛ hokwan.
He can come with me.	Obetumi ne me aba.
I don’t even know what that means.	Minnim nea ɛno kyerɛ mpo.
In your home.	Wɔ wo fie.
But maybe don't take it too literally?.	Nanso ebia mfa no sɛ ɛyɛ nokware dodo?.
It seems to be new.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ foforo.
It sounds like a simple matter.	Ɛte sɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
And no one tells him otherwise.	Na obiara nka nkyerɛ no sɛ ɛnte saa.
He didn't have to tell her.	Na enhia sɛ ɔka kyerɛ no.
He always wanted me then.	Ná ɔpɛ me bere nyinaa saa bere no.
It’s not just an inconvenient sin.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne a ɛnyɛ mmerɛw kɛkɛ.
This path is reflected in the water.	Saa kwan yi da adi wɔ nsu no mu.
Thank you so much!.	Meda wo ase pa ara!.

At least he was with me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɔka me ho.

It’s certainly not the first time someone has used it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ bere a edi kan a obi de adi dwuma.
It’s interesting, but there’s still a problem.	Ɛyɛ anigye, nanso ɔhaw bi da so ara wɔ hɔ.

The use of these languages ​​still exists today.	Kasa ahorow yi a wɔde di dwuma no da so ara wɔ hɔ nnɛ.
You can see the story from here.	Wubetumi ahu asɛm no afi ha.
Our problems are fairly simple.	Yɛn haw ahorow no yɛ mmerɛw koraa.
Evil and good.	Bɔne ne papa.
However, that was his only chance.	Nanso, na ɛno nkutoo ne hokwan a ɔwɔ.

But that’s part of the fun.	Nanso ɛno yɛ anigye no fã.
He says the space is there.	Ɔka sɛ baabi a ɛwɔ hɔ no wɔ hɔ.

He was involved in it.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
He does other things first.	Ɔyɛ nneɛma foforo kan.
During peak season.	Wɔ bere a nnipa pii kɔ hɔ no.
In the past, he loved this house.	Bere bi a atwam no, na n’ani gye ofie yi ho.
It seems like a man can do it.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔbarima betumi ayɛ.
One of the most interesting things is this.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye sen biara no mu biako ne eyi.
It’s not like that there.	Ɛnyɛ saa wɔ hɔ.
It was moist and soft.	Ná ɛyɛ nsu na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.

You can check it out.	Wubetumi ahwɛ.
People are still down there.	Nkurɔfo da so ara wɔ fam hɔ.
He would work with them again.	Anka ɔne wɔn bɛyɛ adwuma bio.
If you say it enough times it has to be true.	Sɛ woka no mpɛn dodow a ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
They are just the thing to do.	Wɔyɛ ade a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ara kwa.

It was a hot, steamy day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ hyew na ɛyɛ hyew.

He knew nothing of my pain.	Ná onnim me yaw no ho hwee.
Please? 	Mesrɛ wo?
The gun went off.	Tuo no bɔɔ.
Not everyone has to do the same things for a team.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nneɛma koro ma kuw bi.
It was very scary.	Ná ɛyɛ hu yiye.
The other people were too scared.	Ná nnipa a aka no suro dodo.
I was brought in immediately.	Wɔde me baa hɔ ntɛm ara.
They were getting hot.	Ná wɔn ho reyɛ hyew.
They even put a gun on the table.	Wɔde tuo mpo too pon no so.
No one came in, the door remained closed.	Obiara amma mu, ɔpon no kɔɔ so too mu.
What matters is you.	Nea ɛho hia ne wo.
Almost never in any language.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ saa da wɔ kasa biara mu.
How do you do this?	Wobɛyɛ dɛn ayɛ eyi?
Suppose this is not true.	Fa no sɛ eyi nyɛ nokware.
That’s popular.	Ɛno agye din.
They don’t like you.	Wɔn ani nnye wo ho.
The strange animals run on.	Mmoa a wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa no tu mmirika kɔ so.
Quickly, quickly.	Ntɛmntɛm, ntɛmntɛm.
He says something, she says something.	Ɔka biribi, ɔno nso ka biribi.
Say that about it.	Ka saa asɛm no.
What you have to believe.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ wugye di.
I say talk to me.	Meka sɛ kasa kyerɛ me.
And I don’t think there’s going to be any danger to that here.	Na minsusuw sɛ asiane biara bɛba saa asɛm no ho wɔ ha.
They are indeed painful.	Wɔyɛ yaw ampa.
New and old.	Foforo ne dedaw.
His legs hurt.	Ne nan yɛ no yaw.
I don’t know when that is.	Minnim bere a ɛte saa.
She is a really hot girl.	Ɔyɛ abeawa a ne ho yɛ hyew ankasa.
That is not possible.	Ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
He didn’t know he’d always do it.	Na onnim sɛ ɔbɛyɛ no bere nyinaa.
And it’s a way for your child to get to know you.	Na ɛyɛ ɔkwan a wo ba no fa so hu wo.
They are fun.	Wɔyɛ anigye.
But this is a mistake.	Nanso eyi yɛ mfomso.
I believe this is the problem.	Migye di sɛ eyi ne ɔhaw no.
It’s not the same situation.	Ɛnyɛ tebea koro no ara.
Eat their children.	Di wɔn mma.
I look forward to doing so.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
She had difficulty concentrating.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma no sɛ ɔde n’adwene besi biribi so.
Children don’t want to do their homework.	Mmofra mpɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔn fie nnwuma.
Just the letter.	Krataa no ara kwa.
This was pretty amazing.	Ná eyi yɛ nwonwa yiye.
Someone else will do the same.	Obi foforo nso bɛyɛ saa.
There is more information here.	Nsɛm foforo wɔ ha.
Her legs were bare.	Ná ne nan ho da hɔ.

Nothing is happening.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛrekɔ so.
The contents of the new house.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ ofie foforo no mu.
As a result, our products have continued to lead the industry.	Ne saa nti, yɛn nneɛma akɔ so adi nnwuma no anim.
And he had the power.	Na ɔwɔ tumi.
The new car can dive underwater.	Kar foforo no tumi tu nsu ase.
The day was going on.	Ná da no rekɔ so.
So this is the next one.	Enti eyi ne nea edi hɔ.
There was no one inside.	Ná obiara nni mu.
People tend to do that, over and over again.	Nkurɔfo taa yɛ saa, mpɛn pii.
You are doing two things.	Woreyɛ nneɛma abien.
Every business is at least one of those things.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, adwuma biara yɛ saa nneɛma no mu biako.
For many years.	Mfe pii ni.
The next day of the month.	Ɔkyena a edi hɔ no.
The beautiful and the vulnerable.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ fɛ ne wɔn a wɔyɛ mmerɛw.
He was her car.	Ná ɔyɛ ne kar.
After all, she is my mother.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, ɔyɛ me maame.
He quickly closed the door.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm too ɔpon no mu.
This system should solve the problem.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nhyehyɛe yi di ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
The cops will want you and me down there first.	Polisifo no bɛpɛ me ne wo wɔ fam hɔ kan.
I can’t even figure out what it is.	Mintumi nhu nea ɛyɛ mpo.
He had done everything he could for her, and there was no question about that.	Ná wayɛ nea obetumi biara ama no, na ɛno ho asɛm biara nni ho.
That’s the only time.	Ɛno nkutoo ne bere no.
It’s the boy.	Ɛyɛ abarimaa no.
He also had a lot.	Ná ɔwɔ pii nso.
I couldn’t see them.	Na mintumi nhu wɔn.
Not that he knew in those terms.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na onim wɔ saa nsɛm no mu.
I need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
This method is shorter than the other method.	Saa kwan yi yɛ tiaa sen ɔkwan foforo no.
Tell him what you told me!	Ka nea woka kyerɛɛ me no kyerɛ no!
Best option in town at this price.	Ɔkwan a eye sen biara wɔ kurow no mu wɔ saa bo yi mu.
The man knows what he is doing.	Ɔbarima no nim nea ɔreyɛ.
That was a great test.	Ná ɛno yɛ sɔhwɛ kɛse.
That would have been better.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
Remember the hours you worked.	Kae nnɔnhwerew a wode yɛɛ adwuma no.
But, I can’t figure out what.	Nanso, me ntumi nhu dɛn.
Look at this.	Hwɛ eyi.
No one has such power.	Obiara nni tumi a ɛte saa.
Keep up the amazing work.	Kɔ so yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa no.
Not that this is necessarily a bad thing.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ eyi yɛ ade bɔne ankasa.
Always be on time.	Yɛ bere ano bere nyinaa.
The ideas speak for themselves.	Adwene ahorow no ka wɔn ho asɛm.
I was in trouble.	Ná mewɔ ɔhaw mu.
Something is going on.	Biribi rekɔ so.
The only thing that was really the same was food.	Ade biako pɛ a na ɛyɛ pɛ ankasa ne aduan.
Do not touch the controls.	Mfa wo nsa nka nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma no.
And that’s how he should be.	Na saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Very comfortable bed.	Mpa a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
The meeting was held over two days.	Wɔde nna abien yɛɛ nhyiam no.
It’s so nice to be nice to you again.	Ɛyɛ anigye kɛse sɛ mɛyɛ wo yiye bio.
But his idea was nothing new.	Nanso na n’adwene nyɛ ade foforo.
The water is so warm here!	Nsu no mu yɛ hyew yiye wɔ ha!
It wasn’t fun.	Ná ɛnyɛ anigye.
He just wants you to take him.	Ɔpɛ sɛ wode no kɔ kɛkɛ.
You need to use this every day.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode eyi di dwuma da biara da.
He doesn’t do anything.	Ɔnyɛ hwee.
The nature of sex.	Sɛnea nna te no.
But it’s not that easy.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
I felt almost alone.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ metee nka sɛ me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ.
That girl is beautiful.	Saa abeawa no ho yɛ fɛ.
Maybe next time, too.	Ebia bere foforo nso.
So you will have less time to do it.	Enti bere kakraa bi na wode bɛyɛ.
He didn't care what the plan was.	Ná nea nhyehyɛe no yɛ no mfa ne ho.
However, it doesn’t last long.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ bere tenten.
Your attitude always does.	Wo su no yɛ saa bere nyinaa.
In the end, the movie has to work.	Awiei koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ sini no yɛ adwuma.
That is also happening.	Ɛno nso rekɔ so.
Most of the time, I don’t really care about that.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛno mfa me ho ankasa.
What did he do?	Ɔyɛɛ dɛn?
They shouldn’t have talked about it.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔka ho asɛm.
No one did that.	Obiara anyɛ saa.
We can use many words.	Yebetumi de nsɛm pii adi dwuma.
Start talking to the space next to your child.	Fi ase ne baabi a ɛwɔ wo ba no nkyɛn no kasa.
He is so easy!	Ɔyɛ mmerɛw yiye!
But, he wasn’t alive, he wasn’t.	Nanso, na onni nkwa, na ɔnyɛ saa.
The reason for this is important.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no ho hia.
But that day is a long way off.	Nanso saa da no yɛ kwan tenten.
And his father, he was at home.	Na ne papa, na ɔwɔ fie.
It’s more dramatic and challenging.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa na ɛyɛ den kɛse.
This is my bedroom.	Eyi ne me mpa.
This is a remarkable thing	Eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa
This is a difficult one.	Eyi yɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
You can’t come.	Worentumi mma.
He was not there yesterday.	Ná onni hɔ nnɛra.
You don’t have to do that now.	Ɛho nhia sɛ woyɛ saa mprempren.
Without them, we can’t do that.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ wɔn a, yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
I don't care how you do it, who you use it for.	Sɛnea woyɛ, onii a wode di dwuma no mfa me ho.
But no one says anything.	Nanso obiara nka hwee.
He says he was great.	Ɔka sɛ na ɔyɛ kɛse.
I'm with you on that.	Me ne wo wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
But it just seems like that.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa pɛn.
I have a lot for you today.	Mewɔ nneɛma pii ma wo nnɛ.
Nothing bad, anyway.	Biribiara bɔne biara nni hɔ, ɔkwan biara so.
Snake.	Ɔwɔ.
It’s not really perfect or good by any means.	Ɛnyɛ nea edi mũ anaa eye ankasa ɔkwan biara so.
This will be real things.	Eyi bɛyɛ nneɛma ankasa.
Everyone loves it!.	Obiara ani gye ho!.
Things were unreal.	Ná nneɛma nyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Next week does not exist.	Dapɛn a edi hɔ no nni hɔ.
We enjoyed our new arrangement.	Yɛn ani gyee yɛn nhyehyɛe foforo no ho.
Put the gun down.	Fa tuo no to fam.
I'm working for you.	Meyɛ adwuma ma wo.
He didn’t feel that way at all.	Ná ɛnyɛ saa na ɔte nka koraa.
Why would he do that.	Dɛn nti na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I am still the same.	Meda so ara te saa.
However, the chances seem nil.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea hokwan ahorow no nyɛ hwee.
I don’t want to know anything.	Mempɛ sɛ mihu biribiara.
What can you find there? 	Dɛn na wubetumi ahu wɔ hɔ?
This is very easy to do.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ.
He stepped on it.	Ɔde ne nan sii so.
She was absolutely beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ koraa.
Here is your dress.	Wo atade no ni.
I’m very excited about it.	M’ani agye ho yiye.
Everybody wanted to play that music.	Ná obiara pɛ sɛ ɔbɔ saa nnwom no.
Tell me why you are here.	Ka nea enti a wowɔ ha no kyerɛ me.
Maybe that’s the case, or maybe not.	Ebia saa na ɛte saa, anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
No one can hear us.	Obiara ntumi nte yɛn.
We already have to put three of them down.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde wɔn mu abiɛsa to fam dedaw.
It is much easier to work with.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse sɛ wode bɛyɛ adwuma.
He leaned closer to her.	Ɔde ne ho too mu bɛn no.
A few of your friends are in the background.	Wo nnamfo kakraa bi wɔ akyi.
This is still there.	Eyi da so ara wɔ hɔ.
He is too popular.	Ɔyɛ obi a nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho dodo.
You have to be strong at what you do.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ den wɔ nea woyɛ no mu.
No one knows but me.	Obiara nnim gye sɛ me nkutoo.
Look, here it is!	Hwɛ, wɔ ha!
There is one thing.	Ade biako na ɛwɔ hɔ.
However, there are exceptions.	Nanso, nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛnyɛ saa.
He wanted to do that.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I just don’t know.	Minnim kɛkɛ.
It’s that bad.	Ɛyɛ bɔne saa.
Everything was fine.	Ná biribiara yɛ yiye.
You don’t want me.	Wompɛ me.
His age well put together.	Ne mfe a ɔde ahyɛ mu yiye.
The back is about the same.	Akyi no bɛyɛ sɛ saa ara.
They all give and take.	Wɔn nyinaa ma na fa.
Don’t tell me.	Nka nkyerɛ me.
Maybe that’s what happened here.	Ebia ɛno ne nea esii wɔ ha.
You can’t say anything.	Worentumi nka hwee.
Most people would do that.	Anka nnipa dodow no ara bɛyɛ saa.
This can cause problems down the road.	Eyi betumi de ɔhaw ahorow aba kwan no so.
I got involved very early on.	Mede me ho hyɛɛ mu ntɛm yiye.
But nothing like what is happening now.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ nea ɛrekɔ so mprempren no.
All the kids were there.	Ná mmofra no nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
But it was him.	Nanso na ɛyɛ ɔno.
It’s not a good thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade pa.
They may not need to do so.	Ebia ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
It’s too quick on my feet.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo wɔ me nan so.
It’s not their business.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm.
For this.	Na eye.
And it was nothing at all.	Na na ɛnyɛ hwee koraa.
He wanted to have sex.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne obi da.
They were going by bus.	Ná wɔde bɔs rekɔ.
He knows everything about it.	Onim ho biribiara.
Two hours later, I regained consciousness of my children.	Nnɔnhwerew abien akyi no, m’adwene san baa me mma no so.
It’s a really great moment.	Ɛyɛ bere kɛse ankasa.
This applies to all subjects.	Eyi fa adesua ahorow nyinaa ho.
I didn’t want to stay up all night.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meda hɔ anadwo mũ no nyinaa.
Probably not much.	Ebia ɛnyɛ pii.
The letter was dishonest.	Ná krataa no kyerɛ sɛ obi nni nokware.
But this was no school.	Nanso na eyi nyɛ sukuu.
We will do our best to help you.	Yɛbɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara de aboa wo.
Your children win.	Wo mma no di nkonim.
I had this problem once.	Ná mewɔ ɔhaw yi bere bi.
Who knows where it was the day before.	Hena na onim baabi a na ɛwɔ da a edi kan no.
That’s another thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade foforo.
I really wanted this to work.	Ná mepɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma ankasa.
No one is busy at all with the convention about to begin.	Obiara nni adagyew koraa wɔ nhyiam no reyɛ afi ase ho.
And he did so.	Na ɔyɛɛ saa.
But it didn’t feel enough.	Nanso na ɛnte nka sɛ ɛdɔɔso.
That’s everything.	Ɛno ne biribiara.
My father was a wonderful man.	Ná me papa yɛ ɔbarima a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
She has complete control over the man these days.	Ɔwɔ ɔbarima no so tumi koraa nnansa yi.
Certainly, it is for me.	Ampa ara, ɛte saa ma me.
His being here was no accident, he knew now.	Ne ha a ɔwɔ no nyɛ akwanhyia, na onim mprempren.
He was a man of action.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔyɛ ade.
And many people did.	Na nnipa pii yɛɛ saa.
Maybe it was then.	Ebia na ɛte saa bere no.
This car was nicer than mine.	Ná saa kar yi yɛ fɛ sen me de no.
Not everyone thinks this is a good idea.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na osusuw sɛ eyi yɛ adwene pa.
He was simply imprisoned.	Wɔde no too afiase ara kwa.
That’s not me.	Ɛno nyɛ me.
It was an evening thing.	Ná ɛyɛ anwummere ade.
Quality is most important.	Su pa ho hia sen biara.
He didn’t like driving.	Ná n’ani nnye ho sɛ ɔbɛka kar.
It’s the story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm no.
He immediately gave way.	Ɔde kwan ntɛm ara.
The same is true of this.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ eyi ho.
That’s not what I have to say.	Ɛno nyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ meka.
Maybe one day this weekend.	Ebia da koro dapɛn awiei yi.
I wanted to believe that.	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye di saa.
And so it becomes much easier.	Na enti ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
So, there is hope.	Enti, anidaso wɔ hɔ.
So full of life.	Enti nkwa ahyɛ mu ma.
I am one of them.	Meyɛ wɔn mu biako.
Please, apologize.	Mesrɛ wo, pa kyɛw.
In looking, he can win it going.	Wɔ hwɛ mu no, obetumi adi nkonim wɔ mu a ɛrekɔ.
There should be no school today.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ sukuu biara wɔ hɔ nnɛ.
Let him do what he wants.	Ma ɔnyɛ nea ɔpɛ.
Suppose the claim cannot be true.	Fa no sɛ asɛm a wɔka no ntumi nyɛ nokware.
So there was this meeting.	Enti na saa nhyiam yi wɔ hɔ.
He didn’t put me there.	Ɛnyɛ ɔno na ɔde me too hɔ.
And it’s still nothing.	Na ɛda so ara yɛ hwee.
He always wants to play.	Ɔpɛ sɛ odi agoru bere nyinaa.
We need to act quickly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi ntɛm.
This is absolutely the biggest point of the film for me.	Eyi ne asɛm kɛse a ɛwɔ sini no mu ma me koraa.
Many, many things.	Nneɛma pii, pii.
Just one of many.	Pii mu biako pɛ.
It’s definitely just not for me.	Ɛyɛ akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ me de kɛkɛ.
And, that’s totally fine.	Na, ɛno yɛ papa koraa.
These animals are not endangered.	Saa mmoa yi nni asiane mu.
Things started a little this time.	Nneɛma fii ase kakra saa bere yi.
It is important that you take action.	Ɛho hia sɛ woyɛ ho biribi.
It was a solid shot.	Ná ɛyɛ tuo a ɛyɛ den.
What you don’t like is what you like.	Nea w’ani nnye ho ne nea w’ani gye ho.
I really wanted to thank you.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meda wo ase ankasa.
I think it’s going to be an interesting thing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye.
However, it doesn’t matter at this point.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ hwee wɔ saa bere yi mu.
You can’t get to him.	Worentumi nkɔ ne nkyɛn.
Time was short.	Ná bere yɛ tiaa.
The features of the comments.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ nsɛm a wɔka no mu.
But for now, you don’t need to do anything about it.	Nanso seesei de, enhia sɛ woyɛ ho biribi.
And it works.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma.
His hands felt numb.	Ne nsa tee nka sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
You can almost see it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wubetumi ahu.
His mind was rare.	Ná n’adwene ho yɛ na.
However, there was nothing exciting.	Nanso, na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ anigye.
And you see that’s over.	Na wuhu sɛ ɛno aba awiei.
I don't know why this is happening.	Minnim nea enti a eyi rekɔ so.
Whatever it is.	Nea ɛwɔ hɔ biara.
I like the way he feels.	M’ani gye sɛnea ɔte nka no ho.
At least ourselves.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yɛn ankasa.
This is hard for so many people.	Eyi yɛ den ma nnipa pii saa.
Everyone who worked with him.	Obiara a ɔne no yɛɛ adwuma.
The way his mind came to him.	Ɔkwan a n’adwene baa so no.
He wants to forget it now.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ne werɛ fi mprempren.
Greater power is needed.	Tumi kɛse ho hia.
This will be a problem.	Eyi bɛyɛ ɔhaw.
I only do household chores.	Ofie nnwuma nkutoo na meyɛ.
It’s just fun to say.	Ɛyɛ anigye ara kwa sɛ wobɛka.
Tomorrow is a long day.	Ɔkyena yɛ da tenten.
It’s my opinion.	Ɛyɛ m’adwene.
Not the way he should be.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no.
I want to be just like him.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ te sɛ ɔno ara pɛ.
That’s why the two of us went there at night time.	Ɛno nti na yɛn baanu kɔɔ hɔ anadwo bere.
A language that everyone understands.	Kasa a obiara te ase.
But nothing happened.	Nanso biribiara anyɛ saa.
Just go through it.	Fa mu kɛkɛ.
The power is there.	Tumi no wɔ hɔ.
He had a problem.	Ná ɔwɔ ɔhaw bi.
I was worried about meetings.	Ná nhyiam ho asɛm haw me.
But look, he did.	Nanso hwɛ sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
And here we are face to face.	Na ha na yɛwɔ anim ne anim.
Make a plan.	Yɛ nhyehyɛe.
I can run.	Metumi tu mmirika.
And it probably isn’t.	Na ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
The more you know, the easier it will be.	Dodow a wunim no, dodow no ara na ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Now I am in the same predicament as my father.	Seesei mewɔ ɔhaw koro no ara a me papa wɔ no mu.
I was put down.	Wɔde me too fam.
She did everything she could for the child.	Ɔyɛɛ nea obetumi biara maa abofra no.
And it wasn’t easy.	Na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
Summer is over.	Awɔw bere aba awiei.
Very good dinner, too.	Anwummere aduan pa ara, nso.
They watched for hours.	Wɔde nnɔnhwerew pii hwɛɛ hɔ.
I’m interested in two things.	M’ani gye nneɛma abien ho.
Water is essential for life.	Nsu ho hia ma nkwa.
Time spent working.	Bere a mede yɛ adwuma.
It’s a beautiful picture.	Ɛyɛ mfonini a ɛyɛ fɛ.
We were very young, both of us.	Ná yɛyɛ mmofra koraa, yɛn baanu nyinaa.
It is not so.	Ɛnte saa.
Keep up the good work.	Kɔ so yɛ adwuma pa no.
I have an important test.	Mewɔ sɔhwɛ bi a ɛho hia.
But it didn’t work.	Nanso anyɛ yiye.
If there is .	Sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ a .
Check out the photo here.	Hwɛ mfonini no wɔ ha.
I want to like this.	Mepɛ sɛ m’ani gye eyi ho.
I tell him that.	Meka saa kyerɛ no.
It’s all over now.	Ne nyinaa aba awiei mprempren.
But this phenomenon complicates it.	Nanso saa ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa yi ma ɛyɛ den.
Thank you for this important information.	Meda mo ase wɔ nsɛm a ɛho hia yi ho.
Like it’s real.	Te sɛ nea ɛyɛ ankasa.
You have to do something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribi.
At least not them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ wɔn.
Use a variety of materials.	Fa nneɛma ahorow di dwuma.
What is best for them as well as themselves.	Dɛn na eye ma wɔn ne wɔn ankasa nso.
He is a strong man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ den.
You're good for me, you know.	Woyɛ papa ma me, wunim.
There is nothing left of that old house.	Biribiara nka saa ofie dedaw no ho.
You should know better than that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu yiye sen saa.
But the problems remain.	Nanso ɔhaw ahorow no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Part of me really didn’t care.	Ná me fã bi mfa ho ankasa.
That’s what was in him.	Ɛno ne nea na ɛwɔ ne mu.
I had to believe that it would all work out.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ migye di sɛ ne nyinaa bɛkɔ yiye.
Imagine a month, a year.	Fa no sɛ ɔsram biako, afe biako.
I am totally conscious at this point.	Meyɛ adwene koraa wɔ saa bere yi mu.
But he certainly will anyway.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa ɔkwan biara so.
Consider the problem.	Susuw ɔhaw no ho hwɛ.
They all knew what to do.	Ná wɔn nyinaa nim nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I see through the past.	Mihu nea atwam no mu.
It’s a hot day today.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ hyew nnɛ.
He was there last night.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ anadwo a etwaam no.
I don't know what to do with it now.	Minnim nea menyɛ no mprempren.
But this feels weak.	Nanso eyi te nka sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Thank you so much for all your help!.	Meda mo ase pii wɔ mo mmoa nyinaa ho!.
I did that that very night.	Meyɛɛ saa anadwo no ara.
I hardly ever talk about him.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ meka ne ho asɛm da.
That makes them really good, not bad.	Ɛno ma wɔyɛ yiye ankasa, na ɛnyɛ sɛ wɔyɛ bɔne.
Through the water just as you would on the ground.	Fa nsu no mu sɛnea wobɛyɛ wɔ fam no ara pɛ.
Remember that dog?	Wokae saa ɔkraman no?
The days in class are long.	Nna a wɔde tra adesua mu no yɛ tenten.
I am .	Meyɛ .
How he could fill it.	Sɛnea na obetumi de ahyɛ mu ma.
Maybe the same thing.	Ebia saa ara.
I thought you two were pretty close.	Misusuwii sɛ mo baanu bɛn wɔn ho yiye.
The results are presented in.	Wɔde nea afi mu aba no akyerɛ wɔ.
That’s actually a little complicated.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛyɛ den kakra ankasa.
I don’t have any friends.	Minni nnamfo biara.
He should be happy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ n’ani gye.
It was an interesting idea.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ anigye.
I had my hair back then.	Ná mewɔ me ti nhwi saa bere no.
I'm here.	Mete ha.
Forget what they tell you in school.	Wo werɛ mfi nea wɔka kyerɛ wo wɔ sukuu mu no.
I loved the phenomenon.	M’ani gyee ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa no ho.
None of them worked for me.	Wɔn mu biara anyɛ adwuma amma me.
I am the one you have to hang out with.	Me na ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no bɔ.
It’s very difficult.	Ɛyɛ den yiye.
He took it to them.	Ɔde kɔɔ wɔn nkyɛn.
It’s what he does.	Ɛyɛ nea ɔyɛ.
I didn’t know what had happened.	Ná minnim nea asi no.
The car group.	Kar kuw no.
And what a one it is.	Na ɛyɛ biako bɛn ara ni.
I handed him a letter.	Mede krataa bi maa no.
The police have been careful.	Polisifo no ahwɛ yiye.
Get out of the city and.	Fi kurow no mu na.
Story after story.	Asɛm akyi asɛm.
Good things.	Nneɛma pa.
You’re my problem.	Wo ne me haw.
The front end.	Anim awiei no.
No one needs that kind of money.	Obiara nhia sika a ɛte saa.
It will be here.	Ɛbɛyɛ ha.
He didn't know what to say.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛka.
Look, they say.	Hwɛ, wɔka sɛ.
And that’s a bad thing.	Na ɛno yɛ ade bɔne.
He knows how to speak many languages.	Onim sɛnea wɔka kasa ahorow pii.
There were many similar cases.	Ná nsɛm a ɛte saa ara pii wɔ hɔ.
You’re not like me.	Wonyɛ sɛ me.
Lots of money.	Sika pii.
He doesn’t know them.	Onnim wɔn.
But things are not so simple.	Nanso nneɛma nyɛ mmerɛw saa.
If it wasn’t him, it would be someone else.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɔno a, anka ɛyɛ obi foforo.
No one else could understand him for the rest of his life.	Obi foforo biara antumi nte no ase ne nkwa nna nyinaa.
The man was relieved.	Ɔbarima no ho tɔɔ no.
And it’s for the greater good.	Na ɛyɛ papa kɛse no nti.
The bus was late again.	Bɔs no san kaa akyi bio.
That can be really painful.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ yaw ankasa.
He just wanted food.	Ná ɔpɛ aduan ara kwa.
And the manufacturers.	Na wɔn a wɔyɛ nneɛma no nso.
This is often true but not always.	Eyi taa yɛ nokware nanso ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa.
The game should be almost over.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛkame ayɛ sɛ agoru no aba awiei.
But it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛnte saa.
Most people don’t know that.	Nnipa dodow no ara nnim saa.
So it was everything.	Enti na ɛyɛ biribiara.
None of us knew what to do about it.	Ná yɛn mu biara nnim nea ɔbɛyɛ wɔ ho.
Time spent working.	Bere a wɔde yɛ adwuma.
That’s pretty much what happened.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ne nea esii.
The meeting unanimously.	Nhyiam no de adwene koro.
Nor should that be surprising.	Saa ara nso na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
He is not feeling well today.	Ne ho nyɛ no den nnɛ.
You have to do your part.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wo fam de.
Simple or not, the diary has appeal for you.	Sɛ́ ɛyɛ mmerɛw anaasɛ ɛnte saa no, da biara da nsɛm nhoma no wɔ anigye ma wo.
When is it going to be?	Bere bɛn na ɛyɛ?
He told us.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn.
No one saw him.	Obiara anhu no.
It’s almost everyone.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ obiara.
He seemed to have it all.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔwɔ ne nyinaa.
No one person can know everything, or even most things.	Onipa biako biara nni hɔ a obetumi ahu biribiara, anaa nneɛma dodow no ara mpo.
But this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t know.	Nanso eyi nkyerɛ sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wuhu.
If you see him again, remind me of him.	Sɛ wuhu no bio a, kae me kyerɛ no.
I can’t see how it matters anymore.	Me ntumi nhu sɛnea ɛho hia bio.
Drive to work in your car.	Fa wo kar mu kɔ adwuma.
No one else went there.	Obi foforo biara ankɔ hɔ.
Like, a lot of people have seen it.	Te sɛ, nnipa pii ahu.
We had a job to do.	Na yɛwɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
The same goes for the other way around.	Saa ara na ɔkwan foforo no nso.
I am a great mother.	Meyɛ maame kɛse.
It’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
This is the problem.	Eyi ne ɔhaw no.
Not much at all.	Ɛnyɛ pii koraa.
I want them to be happy.	Mepɛ sɛ wɔn ani gye.
He liked them both.	Ná n’ani gye wɔn baanu nyinaa ho.
His plan succeeded.	Ne nhyehyɛe no dii nkonim.
He seemed to be a good man.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ onipa pa.
I was on the wrong path.	Ná mewɔ ɔkwan bɔne so.
I feel like my window of opportunity has passed.	Mete nka sɛ me hokwan mfɛnsere no atwam.
He wanted to take the next step.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ade a edi hɔ no.
These things don’t work.	Saa nneɛma yi nyɛ adwuma.
Can anyone help me?	Obi betumi aboa me?
One of those types.	Saa ahorow no mu biako.
She is very beautiful.	Ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
A fragile old paper.	Krataa dedaw a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
He knows how to drive.	Onim sɛnea wɔka kar.
He doesn’t have much money.	Onni sika pii.
I had to work.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma.
I thought he was quite happy.	Misusuwii sɛ n’ani agye koraa.
Let him do this.	Ma ɔnyɛ eyi.
It was an amazing week.	Ná ɛyɛ dapɛn a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This is already old.	Eyi ayɛ dedaw dedaw.
There was no night.	Ná anadwo biara nni hɔ.
I work for good people.	Meyɛ adwuma ma nnipa pa.
They were for problems.	Ná wɔyɛ ma ɔhaw ahorow.
But the time for these plans is now.	Nanso bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe ahorow yi ne mprempren.
He’s just a guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima bi kɛkɛ.
That is not a mistake.	Ɛno nyɛ mfomso.
You have what you wanted.	Wowɔ nea na wopɛ.
He has been very good to me.	Wayɛ me yiye paa.
And he knew it was true.	Na na onim sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
So this will be interesting.	Enti eyi bɛyɛ anigye.
That’s not the case here, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte wɔ ha, ɔkwan biara so.
Maybe it was just a test.	Ebia na ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ bi kɛkɛ.
Feel, feel what you are doing.	Te nka, te nea woreyɛ no nka.
The money was used to buy things.	Wɔde sika no tɔɔ nneɛma.
To say what he has to say.	Sɛ ɔbɛka nea ɔwɔ ka.
Don’t agree with him.	Wo ne no nyɛ adwene.
Always wear an old shirt.	Hyɛ atade dedaw bi bere nyinaa.
I want it to be pretty but simple.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ nanso ɛnyɛ den.
I hope you can do that.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi ayɛ saa.
Why does this happen.	Dɛn nti na eyi ba.
However, more work is always needed.	Nanso, adwuma pii ho hia bere nyinaa.
This made us feel better.	Eyi maa yɛn ho tɔɔ yɛn.
So he could go.	Enti na obetumi akɔ.
I'm telling you a truth.	Meka nokware bi.
He has a famous face.	Ɔwɔ anim a agye din.
At least there is that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno wɔ hɔ.
It’s not that either.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno nso.
It was a good day.	Ná ɛyɛ da pa.
I was only out there for three hours or so.	Ná mewɔ abɔnten hɔ nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa anaa nea ɛte saa pɛ.
So it’s our own thing.	Enti ɛyɛ yɛn ankasa ade.
He was good to me and my children.	Ná ɔyɛ papa ma me ne me mma.
No people are that beautiful.	Nnipa biara nni hɔ a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ saa.
We are the worst.	Yɛn na yɛyɛ bɔne sen biara.
I think you’ll enjoy it.	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ho.
Either way, you know me.	Ɔkwan biara so no, wunim me.
The street is crowded.	Nnipa ahyɛ abɔnten so ma.
Speak and speak.	Kasa na kasa.
And he was with me, too.	Na ɔno nso ka me ho.
Not too bad, really.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne dodo, ampa.
And that was my mistake.	Na ɛno ne me mfomso.
That is the great danger.	Ɛno ne asiane kɛse no.
They all celebrated the day.	Wɔn nyinaa dii da no.
It’s a great game.	Ɛyɛ agoru kɛse bi.
As a child, he played at home.	Bere a na ɔyɛ abofra no, na odi agoru wɔ fie.
It wasn’t a surprise.	Ná ɛnyɛ nwonwa.
I have a picture of it right here.	Mewɔ ne mfonini wɔ ha yi ara.
Good day.	Da pa.
You’ll be interested.	W’ani begye ho.
Suburban homes are expensive.	Afi a ɛwɔ kurow no akyi no bo yɛ den.
How it isn’t.	Sɛnea ɛnyɛ saa.
I think it looks really nice so far.	Misusuw sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa de besi ha.
If not, say so.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ka saa.
We could have gone with him.	Anka yebetumi ne no akɔ.
But anyone can do it cheaply.	Nanso obiara betumi ayɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den.
I totally agree with you.	Me ne wo yɛ adwene koraa.
To be with him.	Sɛ́ wobɛka ne ho.
The girl should not leave the house either.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ abeawa no nso fi fie hɔ.
Feedback can help.	Adwene a wobɛka akyerɛ wo no betumi aboa.
This book absolutely blew me away.	Saa nhoma yi maa me ho dwiriw me koraa.
Not this!.	Ɛnyɛ eyi!.
I think this may be the problem.	Misusuw sɛ ebia eyi ne ɔhaw no.
I understand.	Mete ase.
Maybe he should mention the room.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka dan no ho asɛm.
Many people say that it is the best.	Nnipa pii ka sɛ ɛno ne nea eye sen biara.
He has done this before.	Wayɛ eyi pɛn.
How will it be?.	Ɛbɛyɛ dɛn?.
It was someone completely different.	Ná ɛyɛ obi foforo koraa.
If you were him, what would you do?	Sɛ woyɛ ɔno a, dɛn na wobɛyɛ?
And so it is in the present case.	Na saa na ɛte wɔ mprempren asɛm no mu.
As long as it was lying there, he had no idea.	Bere tenten a na ɛda hɔ no, na onni ho adwene biara.
It looked like it might be over.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ebia na aba awiei.
After that he worked.	Ɛno akyi no ɔyɛɛ adwuma.
He was the first man sent home.	Ɔno ne ɔbarima a odi kan a wɔde no kɔɔ fie.
The meeting was amazing.	Ná nhyiam no yɛ nwonwa.
The problem lies in mass production.	Ɔhaw no da sɛnea wɔyɛ nneɛma pii no so.
A few of them took the child home.	Wɔn mu kakraa bi de abofra no kɔɔ fie.
The car is really interesting.	Kar no yɛ anigye ankasa.
It might be his favorite thing, ever.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ ade a n’ani gye ho paa, da biara.
I can’t imagine what it is to carry that with you.	Mintumi nsusuw nea ɛyɛ sɛ wode saa no bɛka wo ho.
I don’t know how to do it.	Me ntumi nhu sɛnea mɛyɛ.
It must be someone else.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ obi foforo.
That’s my timeline.	Ɛno ne me bere nhyehyɛe.
But he did not know why he did these things.	Nanso na onnim nea enti a ɔyɛɛ saa nneɛma ahorow yi.
It’s a little bit.	Ɛyɛ kakra.
No one seems to have noticed!.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara anhu!.
It’s a party town.	Ɛyɛ apontow kurow.
That happens to any business in any industry.	Ɛno to adwuma biara a ɛwɔ adwuma biara mu.
You can serve it at room temperature.	Wubetumi de ama wɔ dan mu hyew mu.
That’s not as easy as it sounds.	Ɛno nyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛte no.
He took me aside.	Ɔde me kɔɔ nkyɛn.
I don’t want that to be me.	Mempɛ sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ me.
And schools are starting to act on their own.	Na sukuu ahorow afi ase reyɛ ade wɔ wɔn ankasa so.
So very sorry.	Enti kyɛw paa.
Maybe he wasn’t that bad about being around.	Ebia na ɔnyɛ bɔne saa sɛ obi bɛka ne ho.
She was already wet and hot for him.	Ná wayɛ nsu dedaw na ne ho ayɛ hyew ama no.
This did not end well.	Eyi ankɔ awiei yiye.
Like two years ago.	Te sɛ mfe abien a atwam ni no.
I make him one, he makes me one.	Meyɛ no biako, ɔno nso yɛ me biako.
Give everyone a letter.	Ma obiara krataa bi.
How was he this morning?	Ná ne tebea te dɛn anɔpa yi?
Only half of its power is used.	Ne tumi no fã pɛ na wɔde di dwuma.
It’s a simple test.	Ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ a ɛnyɛ den.
It’s not such a big deal.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse a ɛte saa.
That would be a mistake.	Ɛno bɛyɛ mfomso.
Get out of the way.	Fi kwan no so.
You just have to know how to tell him what to do.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu sɛnea wobɛka nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ akyerɛ no ara kwa.
And it was completely wrong.	Na na ɛyɛ mfomso koraa.
I want him.	Mepɛ no.
I can’t quite figure out how you do it.	Me ntumi nhu sɛnea woyɛ no yiye.
It was too much of a face.	Ná ɛyɛ anim dodo.
It was the books.	Ná ɛyɛ nhoma ahorow no.
We need to act immediately.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi ntɛm ara.
Don’t believe that.	Nnye saa asɛm no nni.
I can’t help you.	Me ntumi nnye wo ho.
Such a statement cannot lie.	Asɛm a ɛte saa no ntumi nni atoro.
And he didn’t know.	Na na onnim.
You have yourself.	Wowɔ wo ho.
In other words, you need to know where you are at all times.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu baabi a wowɔ bere nyinaa.
Every morning and afternoon routine.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ anɔpa ne awia biara.
This project is completely relevant to our business.	Saa adwuma yi fa yɛn adwuma no ho koraa.
I loved it there every time.	M’ani gyee ho wɔ hɔ bere biara.
Much bigger this year.	Pii kɛse afe yi.
The inhumanity of man in relation to man seems to be absolute.	Ɛte sɛ nea onipa a ɔnyɛ onipa wɔ onipa ho no yɛ nea edi mũ koraa.
Many people used paper money.	Nnipa pii de krataa sika dii dwuma.
Is it a sin.	So ɛyɛ bɔne.
Or using the wrong man to do it.	Anaasɛ ɔde ɔbarima a ɔnyɛ papa di dwuma de yɛ.
I'm in here and there.	Mewɔ mu wɔ ha ne ha.
Please, take it.	Mesrɛ wo, fa.
So, no help there.	Enti, mmoa biara nni hɔ wɔ hɔ.
Everyone runs there.	Obiara tu mmirika kɔ hɔ.
These plans never materialized.	Saa nhyehyɛe ahorow yi anyɛ nokware da.
Pretty much everyone, anyway.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara, ɔkwan biara so.
This is a little more complicated.	Eyi yɛ nea ɛyɛ den kakra.
Nor should anyone.	Saa ara nso na ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara.
Everyone knew him.	Ná obiara nim no.
You are both my friends.	Mo baanu nyinaa yɛ me nnamfo.
I know this is the truth.	Minim sɛ eyi ne nokware no.
For you, nothing can be more or less simple.	Wɔ wo fam no, biribiara ntumi nyɛ mmerɛw kɛse anaa kakraa bi.
I have a better plan.	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe a eye sen saa.
I don't know about the rest.	Minnim nea aka no ho asɛm.
He had a lot of things.	Ná ɔwɔ nneɛma pii.
It was a pleasure to be with him.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye sɛ na ɔne no wɔ hɔ.
It’s all about desire.	Ne nyinaa fa ɔpɛ ho.
It’s pretty cold there in the winter.	Awɔw yɛ fɛ yiye wɔ hɔ wɔ awɔw bere mu.
I might as well tell you.	Ebia mɛka akyerɛ wo saa ara.
We are all really close to him.	Yɛn nyinaa bɛn no ankasa.
Take it away.	Fa no kɔ.
This is something completely different.	Eyi yɛ biribi foforo koraa.
He is not a nice guy.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It’s a leg.	Ɛyɛ nan.
I would really appreciate any help.	M’ani begye mmoa biara ho ankasa.
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It’s you who knows him.	Ɛyɛ wo na wunim no.
My father saw them too.	Me papa nso huu wɔn.
That’s two for me.	Ɛno yɛ abien ma me.
Please go without me.	Mesrɛ wo, kɔ a me nka ho.
One way or another, it doesn’t matter.	Ɔkwan bi so anaa ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛnyɛ hwee.
That road is often filled with cars.	Kar taa hyɛ saa kwan no ma.
Someone who can do some preliminary tests for us.	Obi a obetumi ayɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow bi a edi kan ama yɛn.
He would help me.	Ná ɔbɛboa me.
If you can help in the next few days.	Sɛ wubetumi aboa wɔ nna kakraa a edi hɔ no mu a.
He really has to be himself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ne ho ankasa.
The big man was sitting on his.	Ná ɔbarima kɛse no te ne de.
He looks like everyone else.	Ɔte sɛ obiara.
Not the other way around.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan foforo so.
And really exciting.	Na anigye ankasa.
The work was very difficult.	Ná adwuma no yɛ den yiye.
Our job then is much easier.	Yɛn adwuma saa bere no yɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
They are strong.	Wɔn mu yɛ den.
We can’t even take them to them at this point.	Yɛrentumi mfa wɔn nkɔ wɔn nkyɛn mpo wɔ saa bere yi mu.
So he touched her.	Enti ɔde ne nsa kaa ne ho.
I knew he did two of these things.	Ná minim sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa nneɛma yi mu abien.
He could have done this.	Anka obetumi ayɛ eyi.
I'm here.	Mewɔ ha.
The story is here.	Asɛm no wɔ ha.
He didn’t like this at all.	Ná n’ani nnye eyi ho koraa.
We need to take advantage of this opportunity.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde hokwan yi di dwuma.
It’s their money.	Ɛyɛ wɔn sika.
I want to take money.	Mepɛ sɛ migye sika.
He wanted it in the most desperate way.	Ná ɔpɛ no wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu sen biara so.
And he wanted to do it right.	Na na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no yiye.
Take it easy on yourself.	Fa no mmerɛw ma wo ho.
Many people need food.	Nnipa pii hia aduan.
Nor did anyone else.	Saa ara nso na obi foforo biara anyɛ saa.
It was just amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
Everyone wants to be the best though.	Obiara pɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nea eye sen biara nanso.
I trust you to do this for me.	Mede me ho to wo so sɛ wobɛyɛ eyi ama me.
I actually had this same issue just two days ago.	Na mewɔ saa asɛm koro yi ara ankasa nna abien pɛ a atwam ni.
It wasn’t as bad as the danger he was in.	Na ɛnyɛ bɔne te sɛ asiane a na ɔwɔ mu no.
I don’t have to look at the table.	Ɛho nhia sɛ mehwɛ pon no so.
He was very, very jealous.	Ná n’ani bere pii, pii.
So your words speak to me.	Enti wo nsɛm no kasa kyerɛ me.
These products are usually very expensive.	Mpɛn pii no, saa nneɛma yi bo yɛ den yiye.
I can hope!.	Metumi anya anidaso!.
You know what parties are like.	Wunim sɛnea apontow ahorow te.
There is no doubt about that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Some things are only here you can see.	Nneɛma bi wɔ ha nkutoo na wubetumi ahu.
It’s almost that wonderful.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa saa.
So for years, that’s what they used.	Enti mfe pii no, ɛno ne nea wɔde dii dwuma.
I want another test or another test.	Mepɛ sɔhwɛ foforo anaa sɔhwɛ foforo.
His wife is another story.	Ne yere nso yɛ asɛm foforo.
Look what he has done to you.	Hwɛ nea wayɛ wo.
So he got involved.	Enti ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
The picture was beautiful.	Ná mfonini no yɛ fɛ yiye.
Nor is it human.	Saa ara nso na ɛnyɛ onipa de.
The time had finally come.	Ná bere no adu awiei koraa.
That thing makes me happy.	Saa ade no ma m’ani gye.
He was someone else.	Ná ɔyɛ obi foforo.
Follow this diet carefully.	Di saa aduan yi akyi yiye.
At least he seemed to be alone.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
What is it that is.	Dɛn ne no.
At the same time more or less.	Wɔ bere koro no ara mu kɛse anaa kakraa bi.
Everyone took good care of him.	Obiara hwɛɛ no ​​yiye.
Anyone can get us for a price.	Obiara betumi anya yɛn de agye bo bi.
I am absolutely sorry about that.	Ɛyɛ me yaw koraa wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
That brings me back.	Ɛno de me san ba.
He wasn't, once.	Ná ɔnyɛ, bere bi.
Good things can be great there.	Nneɛma pa betumi ayɛ kɛse wɔ hɔ.
They love the game.	Wɔn ani gye agoru no ho.
The children are wearing winter clothes.	Mmofra no hyɛ awɔw bere mu ntade.
This is their home.	Eyi ne wɔn fie.
That doesn’t matter.	Ɛno mfa ho.
He didn’t really like going into the classroom.	Ná n’ani nnye ho ankasa sɛ ɔbɛkɔ sukuu dan mu.
They used a lot of that.	Wɔde saa ade no pii dii dwuma.
It’s that time of year again.	Ɛyɛ saa bere no wɔ afe no mu bio.
But you do that.	Nanso woyɛ saa.
He's shown it to her before.	Ɔde akyerɛ no pɛn.
They will definitely be interested in that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔn ani begye saa asɛm no ho.
Not that it matters.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛho hia.
The team struggled mightily this past season.	Kuw no bɔɔ mmɔden kɛse wɔ afe a etwaam yi mu.
We had some of it.	Ná yɛwɔ bi.
They do that job well.	Wɔyɛ saa adwuma no yiye.
Just what I forgot about the meeting.	Nea me werɛ fii nhyiam no ara kwa.
The important things.	Nneɛma a ɛho hia.
I'll give you my bed.	Mede me mpa no bɛma wo.
The day was not starting well.	Ná da no mfi ase yiye.
Or tonight, or right then.	Anaasɛ anadwo yi, anaa saa bere no ara.
It’s a true party.	Ɛyɛ nokware apontow.
And that was a lie, too.	Na ɛno nso yɛ atoro.
This just keeps getting better.	Eyi kɔ so yɛ yiye ara kwa.
All we had to do was do our current study.	Nea na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ara ne sɛ yɛbɛyɛ yɛn mprempren adesua no.
A good learning experience.	Adesua mu ade pa.
People, for me.	Nnipa, ma me.
And inside, you know that.	Na mu no, wunim saa.
People live here.	Nkurɔfo te ha.
He wanted to say more.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka pii.
I shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
In my book, that’s a big deal.	Wɔ me nhoma no mu no, ɛno yɛ ade kɛse.
There were meetings every night.	Ná nhyiam ahorow wɔ hɔ anadwo biara.
It is the application of truth.	Ɛyɛ nokware a wɔde di dwuma.
I understand more than you think.	Mete ase sen sɛnea wususuw.
However, it is only the first step.	Nanso, ɛyɛ ade a edi kan ara kwa.
That’s when the story begins.	Ɛno na asɛm no fi ase.
But he also knew mine.	Nanso na ɔno nso nim me de no.
But now there is a problem.	Nanso seesei ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
More people than you.	Nnipa pii sen wo.
Rumors abounded about this remarkable man.	Ná nsɛm a wɔka fa ɔbarima a ɔyɛ nwonwa yi ho abu so.
But it doesn’t have to be.	Nanso ɛho nhia sɛ ɛte saa.
I wanted to hear another language.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mete kasa foforo.
Tomorrow he could hope again.	Ɔkyena na obetumi anya anidaso bio.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Ná mfomso biara nni saa asɛm no ho.
And it was really good.	Na eye ankasa.
Those words were very true.	Ná saa nsɛm no yɛ nokware paa.
That would take too long.	Ná ɛno begye bere tenten dodo.
Work is pretty good too.	Adwuma yɛ fɛ yiye nso.
The one leading them can see that I am there.	Nea odi wɔn anim no tumi hu sɛ mewɔ hɔ.
Nothing else is on my mind.	Biribiara foforo biara nni m’adwene mu.
But we were doing that.	Nanso na yɛyɛ saa.
Here in the summer, though, they probably always are.	Nanso, wɔ awɔw bere mu ha no, ebia na wɔyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
So my time there was great.	Enti bere a mede wɔ hɔ no yɛɛ kɛse.
I had a great day with my wife and two kids.	Me ne me yere ne me mma baanu nyaa da kɛse bi.
It all seemed so simple at the time.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne nyinaa yɛ mmerɛw saa saa bere no.
They are rare, but they exist.	Wɔyɛ nneɛma a ɛho yɛ na, nanso ɛwɔ hɔ.
If anything, they seemed stronger than before.	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, na ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ho yɛ den sen kan no.
Don’t make things difficult for yourself.	Mma nneɛma nyɛ den mma wo ho.
His conclusion, however, was simple.	Nanso, na nea ɔde baa awiei no yɛ mmerɛw.
They offer a wide variety of vehicles.	Wɔde kar ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
I still don't quite understand why.	Meda so ara nte nea enti a ɛte saa no ase yiye.
But not too long after the first one.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bere tenten dodo wɔ nea edi kan no akyi.
Maybe only the good ones.	Ebia nea eye nkutoo.
I can't think about it tonight.	Mintumi nsusuw ho anadwo yi.
I can’t lead anyone.	Mintumi nni obiara anim.
Children stay for hours.	Mmofra tra hɔ nnɔnhwerew pii.
I know that sounds weird.	Minim sɛ ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It is indeed important.	Ɛho hia ampa.
Time does that.	Bere yɛ saa.
So, that’s all there is to it, really.	Enti, ɛno ara ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ, ampa.
Three of the cases were related.	Ná nsɛm no mu abiɛsa fa ho.
It was all kind of an accident.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ akwanhyia bi.
I like your way of thinking.	M’ani gye sɛnea wususuw nneɛma ho no ho.
I definitely sign up.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mede me nsa hyɛ ase.
For the reasons you want.	Nneɛma a wopɛ no nti.
It’s all going strong.	Ne nyinaa rekɔ so denneennen.
About a week later.	Bɛyɛ dapɛn biako akyi.
I could care less to be honest.	Ná metumi ayɛ nea ɛho nhia pii sɛ mɛka nokware.
The most obvious level of risk is book value.	Asiane dodow a ɛda adi kɛse ne nhoma bo.
But this time, he had to.	Nanso saa bere yi de, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Interestingly, he is not alone.	Nea ɛyɛ anigye no, ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na ɔte saa.
She seemed nice enough.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ fɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
My dad told me it was a bad idea.	Me papa ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ ɛyɛ adwene bɔne.
Ultimately, the self is a concept.	Awiei koraa no, ankasa no yɛ adwene bi.
But only one.	Nanso biako pɛ.
And the products.	Ne nneɛma a wɔyɛ.
Work with him as a team to make this happen.	Wo ne no nyɛ adwuma sɛ kuw na ama eyi ayɛ yiye.
You all have to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mo nyinaa kɔ.
If this is the case.	Sɛ eyi a.
That’s what everybody had.	Ɛno ne nea na obiara wɔ.
That and every user renews every year.	Ɛno ne obiara a ɔde di dwuma no yɛ foforo afe biara.
I just can’t do that.	Mintumi nyɛ saa ara kɛkɛ.
This time, he controls the moment.	Saa bere yi de, ɔno na odi bere no so.
You are all my friends.	Mo nyinaa yɛ me nnamfo.
I had a plan at the time.	Ná mewɔ nhyehyɛe bi saa bere no.
A matter of truth.	Nokware ho asɛm.
This is very important.	Eyi ho hia paa.
He was a very handsome man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
The system should work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nhyehyɛe no yɛ adwuma.
And he wasn’t a man either.	Na ɔno nso nyɛ ɔbarima.
I wanted to taste you.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka wo hwɛ.
His wish came true.	Nea ɔpɛ no baa mu.
He could do with a bed now.	Ná obetumi de mpa ayɛ mprempren.
These shoes are made from soft, soft leather.	Wɔde aboa nhoma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ mpaboa yi.
And really feel your heart.	Na te wo yam ankasa.
Get help where you can get it.	Fa mmoa kɔ baabi a wubetumi anya.
Make two sheets of this paper.	Fa krataa yi yɛ krataa abien.
Assume that person doesn’t care.	Fa no sɛ saa onipa no mfa ho.
I’m not sure how long this post has been.	Me ntumi nhu bere tenten a ɛwɔ saa krataa yi mu.
That table is near the door.	Saa pon no bɛn ɔpon no.
Somehow it seemed unnecessary until today.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia de besi nnɛ.
Everything was fine.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ yiye.
Maybe that’s another reason why they, and kind of, were so successful.	Ebia ɛno ne ade foforo nti a wɔn, ne su no, dii yiye saa.
This number is for one year only.	Saa dodow yi yɛ afe biako pɛ de.
And this time it looks like we are.	Na saa bere yi deɛ ɛte sɛ nea yɛwɔ hɔ.
This is not a team project.	Eyi nyɛ kuw adwuma.
An afternoon of fun.	Awia bi a wɔde gye wɔn ani.
I want you to know.	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu.
In both cases.	Wɔ tebea abien no nyinaa mu.
That funding is you.	Saa sika a wɔde ma no ne wo.
He would joke about it.	Ná ɔbɛka ho agoru.
It’s a wonderful job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I think a lot of people wanted him to.	Misusuw sɛ na nnipa pii pɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Any comments made.	Nsɛm biara a wɔka.
I want that so bad.	Mepɛ saa asɛm no bɔne saa.
I could find words to say.	Ná metumi anya nsɛm a mɛka.
So you can use it easily.	Enti wubetumi de adi dwuma a ɛnyɛ den.
If we are here, we are here.	Sɛ yɛwɔ ha a, yɛwɔ ha.
But it wasn’t his time, it wasn’t his time.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ne bere, na ɛnyɛ ne bere.
You can’t help but rely on yourself.	Wo ntumi nyɛ hwee sɛ wode wo ho to wo ho so.
Throughout the year.	Wɔ afe mũ no nyinaa mu.
These policies are highly illusory.	Saa nhyehyɛe ahorow yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ atoro kɛse.
He tells one of us.	Ɔka yɛn mu biako.
But there are at least two problems.	Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɔhaw abien na ɛwɔ hɔ.
But he doesn’t want to tell me anything else.	Nanso ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka biribi foforo kyerɛ me.
The music is fun.	Nnwom no yɛ anigye.
These things are not dangerous.	Saa nneɛma yi nyɛ asiane biara.
I was hard, very hard, and very wet.	Ná meyɛ den, na meyɛ den yiye, na na meyɛ nsu kɛse.
But no one knows.	Nanso obiara nnim.
You remembered him.	Wokae no.
Go, but be careful.	Kɔ, nanso hwɛ yiye.
Until school started.	Kosi sɛ sukuu fii ase.
I don’t know anyone like that.	Minnim obiara a ɔte saa.
At that point, we can have two opinions.	Saa bere no, yebetumi anya adwene abien.
He’ll be interested.	N’ani begye ho.
They were thrilled.	Wɔn ani gyee ho.
Thank you for your concern and speak again soon.	Meda wo ase wɔ wo haw ho na kasa bio nnansa yi ara.
Not the door, though.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɔpon no ano.
It’s a fun way and not too complicated.	Ɛyɛ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ anigye na ɛnyɛ den dodo.
I am not having any fun.	Menyɛ anigye biara.
You know you want to.	Wunim sɛ wopɛ.
Only he can save them.	Ɔno nkutoo na obetumi agye wɔn nkwa.
The dog is troubled again.	Ɔkraman haw bio.
That’s the problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
I had a reputation.	Ná mewɔ din bi.
The boy set out one cold night.	Abarimaa no sii kwan so anadwo bi a na awɔw wom.
Providing this information is important.	Nsɛm yi a wɔde bɛma no ho hia.
It was all very beautiful.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ fɛ yiye.
Finally, reach for your phone.	Awiei koraa no, fa wo nsa kɔ wo telefon so.
The whole thing is hopeless.	Asɛm no nyinaa yɛ nea anidaso biara nni mu.
Their kids are just like your kids.	Wɔn mma no te sɛ wo mma no ara pɛ.
If you remember this .	Sɛ wokae eyi a .
Which I just loved.	Nea na m’ani gye ho ara kwa.
Next time, maybe.	Bere foforo no, ebia.
It was really exciting.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
It does have that going.	Ɛwɔ saa kɔ no ampa.
You can do anything else.	Wubetumi ayɛ biribi foforo biara.
Both are doing well.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa reyɛ yiye.
We can’t go without water.	Yɛrentumi nkɔ a nsu nnim.
They, I, were on our own.	Wɔn, me, na yɛwɔ yɛn ankasa so.
Another thing seemed odd.	Ná ade foforo nso te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
After that we can’t say anything at this time.	Ɛno akyi no yɛrentumi nka hwee saa bere yi.
I couldn’t lift my head.	Na mintumi mma me ti so.
However, this is not true.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ nokware.
Even that wasn’t easy.	Ná ɛno mpo nyɛ mmerɛw.
I think it was definitely the music.	Misusuw sɛ akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛyɛ nnwom no.
It’s not our problem.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn haw no.
Or making dinner.	Anaasɛ anwummere aduan a wɔyɛ.
I heard about it almost every day.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mete ho asɛm da biara da.
That is a very important point.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm a ɛho hia kɛse.
This was the time for action.	Ná eyi ne bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi.
He could deal with her later.	Ná obetumi ne no adi akyiri yi.
This is terrible.	Eyi yɛ hu.
I don’t need your money.	Me nhia wo sika.
I don't know how.	Minnim ɔkwan bɛn so.
You have been really nice.	Woayɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
I didn’t want him.	Na mempɛ no.
Think about what you’re doing.	Susuw nea woreyɛ no ho.
This is just one thing.	Eyi yɛ ade biako pɛ.
If he could just keep his hand on his gun.	Sɛ obetumi de ne nsa ahyɛ ne tuo no so kɛkɛ a.
Everyone has them.	Obiara wɔ wɔn.
He was very successful.	Na odi yiye kɛse.
The food served must be fresh.	Ɛsɛ sɛ aduan a wɔde ma no yɛ foforo.
These books have been popular for years.	Saa nhoma ahorow yi na nkurɔfo ani gye ho mfe pii.
For me, at least.	Wɔ me fam no, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
I think it’s years ago.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ mfe a atwam no.
People have also tried to do it themselves.	Nkurɔfo nso abɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔn ankasa bɛyɛ saa.
I felt normal.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ obi a ɔte ase.
I wasn’t in charge of them.	Ná ɛnyɛ me na mehwɛ wɔn so.
But no one comes for me.	Nanso obiara mma mma me.
You don’t even know if what you see is real.	Wunnim mpo sɛ nea wuhu no yɛ nokware anaa.
He's great to have you here.	Ɔyɛ kɛse sɛ wowɔ ha.
But he knows one thing.	Nanso onim ade biako.
Even after everything that has happened.	Wɔ biribiara a asi akyi mpo.
Food, the best.	Aduan, nea eye sen biara.
Here's what happened.	Nea esii ni.
But the time will come.	Nanso bere no bɛba.
But it’s possible.	Nanso ɛyɛ yiye.
I didn’t really know what to say.	Ná minnim nea mɛka ankasa.
He is a great guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse bi.
But there is no picture.	Nanso mfonini biara nni hɔ.
This car is almost new.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ saa kar yi yɛ foforo.
He signed this book with me.	Ɔde me nsa hyɛɛ nhoma yi ase.
Too late in the day.	Akyiri dodo wɔ da no mu.
I want something to look after.	Mepɛ biribi a mehwɛ so.
I need to work faster.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma ntɛmntɛm.
Most kids don’t get to do that, but you have that option.	Mmofra dodow no ara nnya kwan nyɛ saa, nanso wowɔ saa kwan no.
But few do.	Nanso kakraa bi na wɔyɛ saa.
. . . .	.
Maybe he was a.	Ebia na ɔyɛ obi a.
Just one shot.	Tuo biako pɛ.
Anyone who didn’t know the situation would have believed him.	Anka obiara a onnim tebea no begye no adi.
The point is that this is a bad thing.	Asɛm no ne sɛ eyi yɛ ade bɔne.
A strong table.	Pon a ɛyɛ den.
It’s too easy to do any good.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo sɛ wobɛyɛ papa biara.
For me, this works even better.	Wɔ me fam no, eyi yɛ adwuma yiye mpo.
I don’t know what to do from here.	Me nnim nea mɛyɛ afi ha.
I know him better than anyone.	Minim no yiye sen obiara.
I got the window and he got the road.	Me nyaa mfɛnsere no na ɔno nso nyaa kwan no.
It would be quite dangerous.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea asiane wom koraa.
What happened in that situation happened.	Nea esii wɔ saa tebea no mu no sii.
However, it wasn’t.	Nanso, na ɛnte saa.
He felt better.	Ne ho tɔɔ no.
Children don’t go to school.	Mmofra nkɔ sukuu.
At least it does for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ ma me.
In the past it wasn’t.	Kan no na ɛnte saa.
It was all real.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
He works to discover the truth.	Ɔyɛ adwuma de hu nokware no.
This man is the.	Saa ɔbarima yi ne.
He’s a great guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse.
You have made my house bad.	Woayɛ me dan bɔne.
I could do nothing else.	Ná mintumi nyɛ biribi foforo biara.
I feel this.	Mete eyi nka.
It is not very important.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia kɛse.
He looked down at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ fam.
He was in great pain.	Ná ɔte yaw kɛse.
He was amazed at the simplicity of it all.	Sɛnea na ne nyinaa yɛ mmerɛw no yɛɛ no ​​nwonwa.
He was hardly a good quality.	Ná ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɔnyɛ su pa.
It’s not about me.	Ɛnyɛ me ho asɛm.
Treat a man like just another kid.	Di ɔbarima bi ho dwuma te sɛ abofra foforo bi kɛkɛ.
And he wasn’t.	Na ɔno nso.
He wasn’t feeling well.	Na ne ho nyɛ no den.
This did much to impress the people.	Eyi yɛɛ pii ma nkurɔfo no ani gyee ho.
He works there too.	Ɔno nso yɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ.
The water feels amazing.	Nsu no te nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I look forward to doing so.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
But the same old problem persists.	Nanso ɔhaw dedaw koro no ara da so ara wɔ hɔ.
I thought it was true at the time.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ nokware saa bere no.
Do it right.	Yɛ no yiye.
I hope these songs work for you.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ saa nnwom yi bɛyɛ adwuma ama wo.
Many people believe that these problems are simple.	Nnipa pii gye di sɛ ɔhaw ahorow yi yɛ mmerɛw.
Perhaps if he had just told her	Ebia sɛ ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​ara kwa a .
My kids have had a great time there.	Me mma anya anigye kɛse wɔ hɔ.
This was a terrible mistake.	Ná eyi yɛ mfomso a ɛyɛ hu.
And not in the cold.	Na ɛnyɛ awɔw no mu.
That means a lot of work for me.	Ɛno kyerɛ adwuma pii ma me.
He just nodded his head.	Ɔde ne ti too fam kɛkɛ.
It’s not happening fast enough.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so ntɛmntɛm.
Any number of people can play it.	Nnipa dodow biara betumi abɔ no.
As many people as possible in person.	Nnipa pii sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye wɔ nnipa mu.
Act quickly now.	Yɛ adwuma ntɛm mprempren.
I had no idea.	Ná minni adwene biara.
And he said unto them, It is enough.	Na ɔka kyerɛɛ wɔn sɛ: Ɛdɔɔso.
And I don’t think so.	Na minsusuw sɛ ɛte saa.
It doesn’t happen anymore.	Ɛnyɛ bio.
I ran out of the house.	Mede mmirika fii adi.
This was happening on both ends of the floor, by the way.	Na eyi rekɔ so wɔ fam no ano abien no nyinaa, ɔkwan bi so no.
You know what you have there.	Wunim nea wowɔ wɔ hɔ.
It was a great job.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
There is no reason to do so yet.	Biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa de besi nnɛ.
It’s a winter day.	Ɛyɛ awɔw bere mu da.
But that is gone now.	Nanso ɛno nni hɔ bio mprempren.
It wasn’t here before.	Na ɛnyɛ ha kan.
No one saw him.	Obiara anhu no.
Everyone was well aware of the situation.	Ná obiara nim tebea no yiye.
Show me anyone who doesn’t do this.	Kyerɛ me obiara a ɔnyɛ eyi.
But he has a plan in the works.	Nanso ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe bi wɔ nnwuma no mu.
However, it will be possible.	Nanso, ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
At least not with him.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ ne nkyɛn.
I have no friends on the outside.	Minni nnamfo biara wɔ abɔnten.
Each of them will be fine.	Wɔn mu biara bɛyɛ yiye.
Really?	Pa ara?
Tonight will be good.	Anadwo yi bɛyɛ papa.
It shouldn’t be that way.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I don’t know much about that time.	Minnim saa bere no ho nsɛm pii.
And it wasn’t us.	Na ɛnyɛ yɛn na ɛte saa.
It was every day.	Ná da biara da.
Maybe he does.	Ebia ɔyɛ saa.
He wasn’t the one.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɔno na ɔte saa.
In your case, time.	Wɔ wo fam no, bere a wɔde yɛ adwuma.
We can handle it in our own way later.	Yebetumi adi ho dwuma wɔ yɛn ankasa kwan so akyiri yi.
The water was boiling.	Ná nsu no rebɔ.
Look at the people.	Hwɛ nnipa.
I can't believe everything is going well for you.	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ biribiara rekɔ yiye ama wo.
Can I know in advance?.	So metumi adi kan ahu?.
This is the last one.	Eyi ne nea etwa to.
That’s what you can do.	Ɛno na wubetumi ayɛ.
No one wants these things.	Obiara mpɛ saa nneɛma yi.
I had to be strong for the kids.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ den ma mmofra no.
You can save their lives.	Wubetumi agye wɔn nkwa.
Again, the same thing.	Bio nso, ade koro no ara.
You can see this in the first two pictures below.	Wubetumi ahu eyi wɔ mfonini abien a edi kan a ɛwɔ ase ha no mu.
Before you say a word, he is you.	Ansa na wobɛka asɛm bi no, ɔno na ɔyɛ wo.
I could barely function.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nyɛ adwuma.
You have the wrong man.	Wowɔ ɔbarima a ɔnyɛ papa.
This just doesn’t follow.	Eyi nni akyi kɛkɛ.
This idea has continued to this day.	Saa adwene yi akɔ so de besi nnɛ.
Only the first one.	Nea edi kan no nkutoo.
My father must be in the system.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me papa wɔ nhyehyɛe no mu.
He will do it himself.	Ɔno ankasa na ɔbɛyɛ.
The man was the only thing he knew.	Ɔbarima no nkutoo ne ade a na onim.
I couldn’t do anything!	Ná mintumi nyɛ hwee!
Few people travel alone these days.	Nnipa kakraa bi na wɔn nkutoo tu kwan nnansa yi.
There was a lot of good in that game.	Ná nneɛma pa pii wɔ saa agoru no mu.
What happened was interesting.	Nea esii no yɛ anigye.
It’s the real thing.	Ɛyɛ asɛm no ankasa.
I still remember it vividly.	Meda so ara kae no yiye.
He could tell her this.	Ná obetumi aka eyi akyerɛ no.
This was bigger than that.	Ná eyi yɛ kɛse sen saa.
I just know some things you obviously don’t know.	Nneɛma bi a ɛda adi sɛ wunnim ara kwa na minim.
I can be with anyone and anything.	Metumi ne obiara ne biribiara tra hɔ.
She liked that guy.	Ná n’ani gye saa ɔbarima no ho.
I never have to do that.	Ɛho nhia sɛ meyɛ saa da.
I don't really know why.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa.
And it was, indeed.	Na ɛte saa, ampa.
Stay home and stay alive.	Tra fie na kɔ so tra ase.
He ran to the door.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ ɔpon no ano.
She had put her children first.	Ná ɔde ne mma adi kan.
They pointed at each other.	Wɔde wɔn nsa kyerɛɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
From where he sat, he could see the bottom of the road.	Ná obetumi afi baabi a ɔte no ahu ɔkwan no ase.
I'm going to.	Mede kɔ.
Give him plenty of time.	Ma no bere pii.
I have done that a couple of times.	Mayɛ saa mpɛn abien.
If you can get one.	Sɛ wubetumi anya bi a.
I’m a fan of food.	M’ani gye aduan ho.
I want him to have it and I want it too.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔwɔ bi na me nso mepɛ.
We all have a weak sense of time.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ bere ho adwene a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
We had that in the first half.	Ná yɛwɔ saa wɔ fã a edi kan no mu.
He is here tonight.	Ɔwɔ ha anadwo yi.
If you know of a way, tell us.	Sɛ wunim ɔkwan bi a, ka kyerɛ yɛn.
That was really hard for me.	Na ɛno yɛ den ma me ankasa.
Do something about it.	Yɛ biribi.
Tomorrow morning, child.	Ɔkyena anɔpa, abofra.
I want to thank him a lot.	Mepɛ sɛ meda no ase pii.
Everyone wants to be number one.	Obiara pɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nea odi kan.
Exercise rights remain within the terms of the document.	Hokwan ahorow a wɔde di dwuma no kɔ so tra krataa no mu nsɛm no mu.
I have to do this for everyone.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi ma obiara.
His father was a passionate man.	Ná ne papa yɛ obi a n’ani gye nneɛma ho kɛse.
What’s going on? 	Dɛn na ɛrekɔ so?
The boy pointed out the window.	Abarimaa no de ne nsa kyerɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
I think this is true.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
Everyone says it’s good, but it’s hard.	Obiara kyerɛ sɛ eye, nanso ɛyɛ den.
I thought it was interesting.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
Things weren’t good.	Ná nneɛma nyɛ papa.
He loved animals.	Ná n’ani gye mmoa ho.
I liked the whole thing.	M’ani gyee asɛm no nyinaa ho.
We can’t be a part of this.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ eyi fã.
Start working on your plans.	Fi ase yɛ wo nhyehyɛe ahorow no ho adwuma.
It’s very cold.	Ɛyɛ awɔw kɛse.
We seem to have the same idea.	Ɛte sɛ nea yɛwɔ adwene koro no ara.
That living room is where he lives.	Saa dan a ɛwɔ dan mu no ne baabi a ɔte.
They are good about that.	Wɔyɛ papa wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I have done it so many times.	Mayɛ no mpɛn pii saa.
The risk is greater for children.	Asiane no yɛ kɛse ma mmofra.
The night was difficult.	Ná anadwo no yɛ den.
He wants to do the play.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ agoru no.
Or so the song went.	Anaasɛ saa na dwom no kɔɔ so.
You know the plan.	Wunim nhyehyɛe no.
However, his good intentions could go a little further.	Nanso, na n’adwene pa no betumi akɔ akyiri kakra.
It is not difficult.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
At least for me it does.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ me fam no, ɛyɛ saa.
But he was there, just like that.	Nanso na ɔwɔ hɔ, saa ara.
Believe me.	Gye me di.
We immediately forget them.	Yɛn werɛ fi wɔn ntɛm ara.
It’s time to do it.	Ɛyɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I knew better now.	Ná minim yiye mprempren.
I have a lot of time.	Mewɔ bere pii.
So it looked really good.	Enti na ɛte sɛ nea eye ankasa.
And he would do bad things.	Na ɔbɛyɛ nneɛma bɔne.
So much had happened since that day.	Enti na nneɛma pii asi fi saa da no.
He wanted no part of that.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɛno fã biara.
Check yourself the next time you drive.	Hwɛ wo ho bere foforo a wobɛka kar no.
Everything else today will be about him.	Biribiara a aka nnɛ no bɛyɛ ne ho asɛm.
We put a lot of work into it.	Yɛde adwuma pii yɛ mu.
Look closely at this picture.	Hwɛ mfonini yi yiye.
And all of these things did happen over time.	Na saa nneɛma yi nyinaa sii ampa bere kɔɔ so.
I don’t really want it to be a part of me.	Mempɛ ankasa sɛ ɛbɛyɛ me fã.
Every day about it.	Da biara da wɔ ho.
The room is papered.	Wɔde krataa ayɛ dan no mu ma.
I know he can.	Minim sɛ obetumi.
That boy always bothers me!	Saa abarimaa no haw me bere nyinaa!
A little sleep, maybe some dinner.	Da kakra, ebia anwummere aduan bi.
On the other hand, however, there has been another.	Nanso, ɔkwan foforo so no, foforo nso aba.
He is very multilingual.	Ɔyɛ obi a onim kasa pii yiye.
I saw him for the first time.	Mihuu no nea edi kan.
I'm just there to .	Mewɔ hɔ ara kwa sɛ .
And that’s it, really.	Na ɛno ne no, ampa.
It certainly looks good though.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ nanso.
Was that too soon?.	So na ɛno yɛ ntɛm dodo?.
I see the problem.	Mihu ɔhaw no.
A week is just a week.	Dapɛn biako yɛ dapɛn biako pɛ.
I want to put it in your hands.	Mepɛ sɛ mede hyɛ wo nsa.
However, it is not a good idea.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ adwene pa.
It is very beautiful indeed.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye ampa.
The good things you do are amazing.	Nneɛma pa a woyɛ no yɛ nwonwa.
These shoes are really nice.	Saa mpaboa yi yɛ fɛ ankasa.
It feels fresh.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ foforo.
They appreciated the help they received.	Wɔn ani gyee mmoa a wɔde maa wɔn no ho.
Maybe not even a team.	Ebia ɛnyɛ kuw bi mpo.
Or maybe the year after that.	Anaasɛ ebia afe a edi ɛno akyi no.
It had been arranged by his father.	Ná ne papa na wayɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
If you look good, you will feel better.	Sɛ wo ho yɛ fɛ a, wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
Every shot started going inside.	Tuo biara fii ase kɔɔ mu.
Do this several times a day.	Yɛ eyi mpɛn pii da biara.
It had to do all of that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa nneɛma no nyinaa.
Why is he the one? 	Dɛn nti na ɔno?
There was no license on it.	Ná tumi krataa biara nni so.
We all know the story.	Yɛn nyinaa nim asɛm no.
The car went into the driveway.	Kar no kɔɔ kar kwan no so.
Sure, that’s really exciting.	Ampa, ɛno yɛ anigye ankasa.
Who knows what happened.	Hena na onim nea esii.
Last year, however, something strange happened to him.	Nanso, wɔ afe a etwaam no mu no, biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa too no.
For us today this is the big problem.	Yɛn a yɛwɔ hɔ nnɛ no eyi ne ɔhaw kɛse no.
They provide food.	Wɔde aduan ma.
Without my stuff.	Sɛ me nneɛma nni hɔ a.
You are beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ.
There should be no game.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ agoru biara nni hɔ.
It will be great.	Ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
He quickly did what I wanted to say.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm yɛɛ nea mepɛ sɛ meka no.
Your hand was not a beautiful sight.	Ná wo nsa nyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ a wubetumi ahu.
He's just making the room.	Ɔreyɛ dan no ara kwa.
But nothing seems to work.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea biribiara ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
No one else can do it.	Obi foforo biara ntumi nyɛ.
I didn’t know what had happened.	Ná minnim nea asi.
We will do that anyway.	Yɛbɛyɛ saa ɔkwan biara so.
Often, the best option is not the most obvious one.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ ɔkwan a eye sen biara no ne nea ɛda adi kɛse.
Right now, I don’t seem to care.	Seesei ara, ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia me.
That’s how this felt.	Saa na na eyi te nka.
We hope you enjoy it.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho.
That is such a dangerous thing to do.	Ɛno yɛ ade a asiane wom saa a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
He liked it better this way.	N’ani gyee ho yiye wɔ saa kwan yi so.
We drove to his apartment later that evening.	Yɛde kar kɔɔ ne dan mu akyiri yi saa anwummere no.
It must have been in the car.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛwɔ kar no mu.
So, put it on me.	Enti, fa to me so.
More thoughts than one foot at a time.	Adwene pii sen nan biako wɔ bere koro mu.
His head didn't hurt anymore.	Ne ti anyɛ no yaw bio.
Say what you have to say.	Ka nea ɛsɛ sɛ woka.
Everything it was when they were kids.	Biribiara a na ɛyɛ bere a na wɔyɛ mmofra no.
I don’t know if that would even work.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma mpo anaa.
But smart money says.	Nanso sika a nyansa wom ka sɛ.
Just run away.	Tu mmirika kɔ kɛkɛ.
He was a target.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a wɔde wɔn ani asi no so.
Almost no one thought such a day would come.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na obiara nsusuw sɛ da a ɛte saa bɛba.
A bright child, it was true.	Abofra a ne ho yɛ hyew, na ɛyɛ nokware.
I have given that opinion.	Mede saa adwene no ama.
Not two, not three.	Ɛnyɛ abien, ɛnyɛ abiɛsa.
Every child can speak.	Abofra biara tumi kasa.
He was a man like me.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa te sɛ me.
I’m interested, it is.	M’ani gye ho, ɛyɛ.
Is this idea appealing?	So saa adwene yi ani gye ho?
It was a lie.	Ná ɛyɛ atoro.
I can’t get started.	Me ntumi mfi ase.
I know myself.	Minim me ho.
I love the immediacy of the response.	M’ani gye sɛnea wɔyɛ ho biribi ntɛm ara no ho.
It was only sex.	Ná ɛyɛ nna nkutoo.
There are two pictures on the back of the card.	Mfonini abien na ɛwɔ krataa no akyi.
One day his will come.	Da bi na ne de bɛba.
Which is obviously not the point of the story.	Nea ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ asɛm a ɛwɔ asɛm no mu no.
How exactly does this work?	Ɔkwan bɛn so ankasa na eyi yɛ adwuma?
Scary.	Ɛyɛ hu.
He seemed happy to be there.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ.
This one didn’t have one.	Ná eyi nni bi.
I hope they all feel that way.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wɔn nyinaa te nka saa.
I have worked for my father.	Mayɛ adwuma ama me papa.
But this was really, really great.	Nanso na eyi yɛ kɛse ankasa, ankasa.
There is a danger.	Asiane wɔ hɔ.
Maybe I’m the only one.	Ebia me nkutoo.
Understand that now.	Te saa asɛm no ase mprempren.
I'm just doing a job.	Meyɛ adwuma bi kɛkɛ.
He pointed to one.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ biako so.
That was something he needed to hear.	Ná ɛno yɛ biribi a na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte.
It’s still run by humans.	Ɛda so ara yɛ nnipa na wɔde tu mmirika.
There are hardly any streets in the city	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ abɔnten biara nni kurow no mu
It’s not great at all.	Ɛnyɛ kɛse koraa.
I couldn’t find the words.	Na mintumi nhu nsɛm no.
But it was too late.	Nanso na aka akyi dodo.
There was nothing.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ.
The movie takes you somewhere else.	Sini no de wo kɔ baabi foforo bi.
There is no time to think about it.	Bere biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
I don’t know anyone around here.	Minnim obiara wɔ ha ho.
There is no need to do that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
A great plan.	Nhyehyɛe kɛse bi.
I had never forgotten.	Ná me werɛ mfi da.
You have done so much for me.	Woayɛ pii ama me.
As if that meant anything.	Te sɛ nea ɛno kyerɛ biribi.
You wanted him.	Wo na na wopɛ no.
And it’s probably best that he doesn’t.	Na ebia eye sen biara sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
To be a human being.	Sɛ́ wobɛyɛ onipa.
No one wanted him.	Ná obiara mpɛ no.
We have a lot of things to do.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
His wife was drowned.	Ne yere nsu faa no.
Tonight he would make his move.	Anadwo yi na ɔbɛyɛ ne tu.
If it works, it works.	Sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a, ɛyɛ adwuma.
The story ended there.	Asɛm no baa awiei wɔ hɔ.
This was a habit.	Ná eyi yɛ su.
After all, things hadn’t been so bad.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na nneɛma anyɛ bɔne saa.
Use it when you have to.	Fa di dwuma bere a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa no.
He was not terrible.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hu.
If you take it to one of those things, it works.	Sɛ wode kɔ saa nneɛma no mu biako mu a, ɛyɛ adwuma.
I didn’t know if it would.	Ná minnim sɛ ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa anaa.
My father meant something to him.	Ná me papa kyerɛ biribi ma no.
Maybe for you, he might.	Ebia wo fam no, ebia ɔbɛyɛ saa.
It should be fun.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
She was really beautiful.	Ná wayɛ fɛ ankasa.
That’s why he’s here.	Ɛno nti na ɔwɔ ha no.
I am doing really well with this.	Mereyɛ yiye ankasa wɔ eyi mu.
She looked better than she had in years.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ sen sɛnea na ɛte wɔ mfe pii mu no.
He must have known that we didn’t need money.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na onim sɛ sika ho nhia yɛn.
There was no issue.	Ná asɛm biara nni hɔ.
We had help.	Ná yɛwɔ mmoa.
You had to know.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
I think it was even faster than last time.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ ntɛm mpo sen bere a etwaam no.
You have years and years.	Wowɔ mfe ne mfe.
It must be a real test.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ sɔhwɛ ankasa.
It will be so good.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa saa.
But isn’t it an easy task.	Nanso so ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I absolutely do this.	Meyɛ eyi koraa.
You can see that.	Wubetumi ahu saa.
Not that he could do much.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na obetumi ayɛ pii.
It has that face as well.	Ɛwɔ saa anim no nso.
The time has come to end this crisis.	Bere adu sɛ wɔde ɔhaw yi ba awiei.
This also does not apply here.	Eyi nso mfa ho wɔ ha.
At least it’s not really true.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa.
Likewise.	Saa ara na.
So everything becomes more alive for me.	Enti biribiara bɛyɛ nkwa kɛse ma me.
But we can talk about that later.	Nanso yebetumi aka saa asɛm no ho asɛm akyiri yi.
That is no longer the point.	Ɛno nyɛ asɛm no bio.
Otherwise it will be.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I'll come with you, if that's what you want.	Me ne wo bɛba, sɛ ɛno ne nea wopɛ a.
They seemed to be a very nice group.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ kuw bi a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
You can handle it.	Wubetumi adi ho dwuma.
He was very warm.	Ná ne ho yɛ hyew yiye.
That’s very interesting in most cases.	Ɛno yɛ anigye kɛse wɔ nsɛm dodow no ara mu.
Believe me.	Gye me di.
But, often now too.	Nanso, mpɛn pii no mprempren nso.
Just get to know them.	Hu wɔn ara kwa.
More on this later.	Eyi ho nsɛm pii akyiri yi.
I think it’s a very good thing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ ade pa paa.
On the other side of the door.	Wɔ ɔpon no fã foforo no.
We were alone in the room.	Ná yɛn nkutoo wɔ dan no mu.
However, it doesn’t matter.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ hwee.
Anyone with the same problem.	Obiara a ɔwɔ ɔhaw koro no ara.
So they do.	Enti wɔyɛ.
Still no joy.	Anigye biara da so ara nni hɔ.
I know, I do, too.	Minim, me nso.
Only rare photos available.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛho yɛ na nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
It is in very good condition.	Ɛwɔ tebea pa mu yiye.
Who likes water?	Hena na n’ani gye nsu ho?
We are a group.	Yɛyɛ kuw bi.
The police were fantastic.	Ná polisifo no yɛ nwonwa.
He's pretty good about it.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye wɔ ho.
I was good with them.	Ná me ne wɔn yɛ papa.
You are among friends.	Woka nnamfo ho.
However, the same.	Nanso, saa ara.
There are various modes of transportation.	Nneɛma ahorow a wɔde fa nnipa wɔ hɔ.
If you know me, you know this story.	Sɛ wunim me a, wunim saa asɛm yi.
When their child is inside her.	Bere a wɔn ba no wɔ ne mu.
Timing is critical.	Bere a wɔde yɛ no ho hia kɛse.
Children should play outside.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra di agoru wɔ abɔnten.
Everything is brand new.	Biribiara yɛ foforo koraa.
It would be expensive.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ nea ne bo yɛ den.
He absolutely loves being on this team.	N’ani gye ho koraa sɛ ɔbɛka kuw yi ho.
Use it to do something awesome.	Fa yɛ biribi a ɛyɛ hu.
No one seems to do that.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ saa.
I want to look them in the eye.	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ wɔn ani so.
This money should be used only for this purpose.	Saa sika yi na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde yɛ eyi nkutoo.
He didn’t know if he had done the right thing.	Na onnim sɛ ebia wayɛ ade pa anaa.
I have nothing else to do, really.	Minni biribi foforo biara a mɛyɛ, ampa.
And he took me with him.	Na ɔde me kaa ne ho.
I thought maybe.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia.
Consider a very problematic case.	Susuw asɛm bi a ɔhaw wom kɛse ho hwɛ.
There are a lot of ideas out there.	Adwene pii wɔ hɔ a ɛwɔ hɔ.
They will both go.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa bɛkɔ.
A few days will be a month.	Nna kakraa bi bɛyɛ ɔsram.
Engage in a project when it is not trendy.	Fa wo ho hyɛ adwuma bi mu bere a ɛnyɛ nea aba so foforo no.
Amma lived one day at a time.	Amma traa ase da koro biara.
He wasn’t surprised at all.	Anyɛ no nwonwa koraa.
So it seems likely that just this might work.	Enti ɛte sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ebia eyi ara kwa no bɛyɛ adwuma.
He could take care of himself.	Ná obetumi ahwɛ ne ho so.
Anyone can build whatever they want.	Obiara betumi asi nea ɔpɛ biara.
You for that reason.	Wo ma ɛno nti.
That said, our stay went smoothly.	Ɛno akyi no, yɛn tra no kɔɔ so yiye.
So that’s a good point.	Enti ɛno yɛ asɛm pa.
The boy rode his bike out onto the road.	Abarimaa no de ne sakre no fii adi kɔɔ kwan no so.
But only for a few days.	Nanso nna kakraa bi pɛ.
Everyone had a story.	Ná obiara wɔ asɛm bi.
Do what you want.	Yɛ nea wopɛ.
Maybe it was the hair.	Ebia na ɛyɛ ti nhwi no.
And what’s left for me.	Na nea aka ama me.
Powerful words indeed.	Nsɛm a tumi wom ampa.
The story at stake may just be true.	Ebia asɛm a ɛwɔ asiane mu no bɛyɛ nokware ara kwa.
But many of them don’t understand.	Nanso wɔn mu pii nte ase.
Make it better.	Ma ɛnyɛ papa.
But that thought doesn't help warm him up now.	Nanso saa adwene no mmoa mma ne ho nyɛ hyew mprempren.
I really do that.	Meyɛ saa ankasa.
Just as you should.	Sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no ara pɛ.
It must all be just as wonderful for him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ne nyinaa yɛ nwonwa saa ara ma no.
I had to get to know him better.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no yiye.
It was always his name.	Ná ɛyɛ ne din bere nyinaa.
I know what you can do.	Minim nea wubetumi ayɛ.
This is a terrible story.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ hu.
And it had power.	Na na ɛwɔ tumi.
Put it in the box.	Fa no to mu.
We even made one whole paper !.	Yɛde krataa mũ biako mpo yɛɛ !.
They were not interested in that.	Ná wɔn ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
For freshwater use only.	Wɔ nsu pa a wɔde di dwuma nkutoo ho.
It’s the same thing here.	Ɛyɛ ade koro no ara wɔ ha.
There was one door.	Ná ɔpon biako wɔ hɔ.
There has been a lot of fun, a lot of learning, a lot of things going on.	Anigye pii aba, adesua pii, nneɛma pii akɔ so.
Still full hair, mind and you.	Da so ara yɛ ti nhwi a ɛyɛ ma, adwene ne wo.
Maybe it was what he wanted.	Ebia na ɛyɛ nea na ɔpɛ.
You can’t help your friends.	Worentumi mmoa wo nnamfo.
This runs in one test.	Eyi tu mmirika wɔ sɔhwɛ biako mu.
A tall man strode into the room.	Ɔbarima tenten bi de mmirika kɔɔ dan no mu.
And the boy will tell them.	Na abarimaa no bɛka akyerɛ wɔn.
The room was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ dan no mu ma.
His mother always looks after him.	Ne maame hwɛ ne ho bere nyinaa.
You have no idea what that meant to me.	Wunnim nea na ɛno kyerɛ ma me.
Tell me the whole story.	Ka asɛm no nyinaa kyerɛ me.
He has done it very well.	Wayɛ no yiye paa.
He should have done something about it.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ho biribi.
This is the systems thinking style.	Eyi ne nhyehyɛe ahorow adwene kwan.
It doesn’t hurt when he hits me.	Ɛnyɛ yaw bere a ɔbɔ me mu no.
I’ve pretty much been the only one ever.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ me nkutoo na meyɛ saa pɛn.
But that’s his name.	Nanso ɛno ne ne din.
He says he knows.	Ɔka sɛ onim.
I want to get to know him better.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu no yiye.
I knew for sure that there was something more to our story.	Ná minim no yiye sɛ biribi foforo wɔ yɛn asɛm no mu.
We hope you can help.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi aboa.
So this is a new situation.	Enti eyi yɛ tebea foforo.
Take this gun.	Fa saa tuo yi.
I hope you like them!.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w'ani begye wɔn ho!.
It really, really does.	Ɛyɛ ampa, ampa, ɛyɛ saa.
It feels to me like the latter.	Ɛte nka ma me sɛ nea etwa to no.
And that’s what this is about.	Na ɛno ne nea eyi fa ho.
And this is the same thing.	Na eyi ne ade koro no ara.
Things were going well.	Ná nneɛma rekɔ so yiye.
He wanted that very much.	Ná ɔpɛ saa paa.
A man of few words.	Ɔbarima a ɔka nsɛm kakraa bi.
There is only one thing behind this.	Ade biako pɛ na ɛwɔ eyi akyi.
He is very strong in every other way.	Ɔyɛ den yiye wɔ ɔkwan foforo biara so.
He had the pictures.	Ná ɔwɔ mfonini ahorow no.
Maybe you can get a chance.	Ebia wubetumi anya kwan.
And it’s much better that it should be.	Na ɛyɛ papa kɛse sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
I don’t like this system.	M’ani nnye nhyehyɛe yi ho.
Surely, there has to be something.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, ɛsɛ sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ.
It’s still going too.	Ɛda so ara kɔ nso.
And that had to be it.	Na na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ saa.
The present is great.	Mprempren no yɛ kɛse.
I love making things.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ nneɛma.
And that way is a good way.	Na saa ɔkwan no yɛ ɔkwan pa.
He had a job to do.	Ná ɔwɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
What kind of person was he?	Ná ɔyɛ onipa bɛn?
He’s gone, too.	Ɔno nso akɔ.
For our part, let’s be happy.	Yɛn fam no, momma yɛn ani nnye.
But they got involved anyway.	Nanso wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ mu ɔkwan biara so.
But he wasn’t alone.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo.
He wanted his father to be himself.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ne papa yɛ ne ho.
All eyes were still on him.	Ná wɔn nyinaa ani da so ara hwɛ no.
Which is also not cheap.	Nea ɛno nso nyɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den.
The children come here.	Mmofra no ba ha.
The boy doesn't know what to say.	Abarimaa no nnim nea ɔbɛka.
I didn’t know what to do.	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ.
All the good stuff.	Nneɛma pa nyinaa.
The water was starting to fill much faster now.	Ná nsu no afi ase reyɛ ma ntɛmntɛm kɛse mprempren.
It’s like he made a home.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛɛ ofie.
You know what that was like.	Wunim sɛnea na ɛno te.
It must be one of his father's.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ne papa de no mu biako.
You are out there.	Wowɔ abɔnten hɔ.
Keep an eye out for them and remove as needed.	Hwɛ yiye ma wɔn na yi fi hɔ sɛnea ɛho hia.
Not really very good, but really very bad.	Ɛnyɛ papa kɛse ankasa, nanso bɔne kɛse ankasa.
There were many people in his room.	Ná nnipa pii wɔ ne dan no mu.
Give this a try.	Fa eyi bɔ mmɔden.
Thank you so much for any help.	Meda wo ase pii wɔ mmoa biara ho.
All we can see is that the story must continue.	Nea yebetumi ahu ara ne sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ asɛm no kɔ so.
He knew which side of the bed belonged to him.	Ná onim mpa no fã a ɛyɛ ne de.
I could show it to him.	Ná metumi de akyerɛ no.
I just want someone to trust.	Mepɛ sɛ obi de ne ho to so kɛkɛ.
It was their last job.	Ná ɛyɛ wɔn adwuma a etwa to.
He is completely unaware of the danger.	Onnim asiane no koraa.
Act on your plan immediately.	Yɛ wo nhyehyɛe no ho biribi ntɛm ara.
Tell him what happened.	Ka nea esii no kyerɛ no.
It’s a beautiful picture.	Ɛyɛ mfonini a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Everyone is so close here.	Obiara bɛn hɔ yiye wɔ ha.
He is really bad.	Ɔyɛ bɔne ankasa.
He could have made it much longer.	Anka obetumi ama ayɛ tenten kɛse.
This is not the situation in the present case.	Eyi nyɛ tebea a ɛwɔ mprempren asɛm yi mu no.
He had something in each hand.	Ná ɔwɔ biribi wɔ ne nsa biara mu.
I want to see him.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu no.
And it still is today.	Na ɛda so ara yɛ saa nnɛ.
Without a doubt, he is.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔte saa.
Just like mine is.	Sɛnea me de no te no.
And that doesn’t matter either.	Na ɛno nso nyɛ hwee.
All faces, people and wonder.	Anim, nnipa ne nwonwa nyinaa.
But that’s just us.	Nanso ɛno yɛ yɛn nkutoo.
We played with our shorts and bare feet.	Yɛde yɛn ntade tiaa ne yɛn nan a ɛda hɔ no dii agoru.
And it was a big mistake.	Na na ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
This need not have been a big deal.	Ná enhia sɛ eyi yɛ asɛm kɛse.
He’s interested in that.	N’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
We both backed away.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa san yɛn akyi.
Give what you want most.	Fa nea wopɛ kɛse no ma.
He almost hit a boy with his car.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔde ne kar bɔɔ abarimaa bi.
Nothing too exciting.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ anigye dodo.
It must be very difficult.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den yiye.
Remember the game.	Kae agoru no.
He would have liked that.	Anka n’ani begye ho saa.
It sounds interesting.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
Not the real story, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm ankasa no, ɔkwan biara so.
The house was very crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ fie hɔ ma kɛse.
Can you move that ?	So wubetumi atu saa asɛm no ?
I saw him.	Mihuu no.
I really think this is going to be great.	Misusuw ankasa sɛ eyi bɛyɛ kɛse.
There is no one method that will work best for everyone.	Ɔkwan biako biara nni hɔ a ɛbɛyɛ adwuma yiye ama obiara.
These shoes hurt my feet.	Saa mpaboa yi yɛɛ me nan yaw.
It’s not a pretty picture.	Ɛnyɛ mfonini a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Please, one meal.	Mesrɛ wo, aduan biako.
It was something I knew well.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a minim yiye.
He seemed to like her, too.	Ɛte sɛ nea na n’ani gye ne ho, nso.
That’s why he’s here.	Ɛno nti na ɔwɔ ha no.
I couldn’t get there.	Na mintumi nkɔ hɔ.
This was a lot of it.	Ná eyi yɛ pii.
I have plans.	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow.
He would work too.	Ná ɔno nso bɛyɛ adwuma.
That can be very exciting.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ anigye kɛse.
Or maybe it was this.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɛyɛ eyi.
It was like being a kid again.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea meyɛ abofra bio.
A dog whistles about its head ominously.	Ɔkraman bi bɔ ne ti ho asɛm wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu so.
It’s terrible stuff.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ hu.
He really is a great guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse ampa.
That’s all that’s left of him.	Ɛno nkutoo ne ade a aka wɔ ne ho.
The poster had several pictures.	Ná mfonini ahorow pii wɔ krataa no so.
Not just one person.	Ɛnyɛ onipa biako pɛ.
But this would work.	Nanso na eyi bɛyɛ adwuma.
Nothing spectacular so far.	Biribiara a ɛyɛ nwonwa de besi nnɛ.
The power is most important for this.	Tumi no ho hia sen biara ma eyi.
But feet and hands are very important.	Nanso nan ne nsa ho hia paa.
We really enjoyed our meal.	Yɛn ani gyee yɛn aduan ho paa.
These tests are important.	Saa sɔhwɛ ahorow yi ho hia.
I just snuggled up to myself.	Mede me ho bɔɔ me mu kɛkɛ.
Take a long journey	Fa kwan tenten bi tu kwan
His name is flawless.	Ne din no yɛ nea mfomso biara nni ho.
Just tell me about it.	Ka kyerɛ me kɛkɛ.
Put that aside.	Fa saa asɛm no to nkyɛn.
A lot of that.	Ɛno mu pii.
It’s the nature of the work.	Ɛyɛ adwuma no su.
He had to say something.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka biribi.
Tell us this and you can go home.	Ka eyi kyerɛ yɛn na wubetumi akɔ fie.
He spoke to them with enthusiasm.	Ɔde anigye kasa kyerɛɛ wɔn.
But look at it.	Nanso hwɛ mu.
These systems are very simple.	Saa nhyehyɛe ahorow yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
He had done it himself, as a child.	Na ɔno ankasa ayɛ, sɛ abofra.
I can’t do anything about him.	Mintumi nyɛ ne ho hwee.
We can see nothing of life here.	Yɛrentumi nhu nkwa ho hwee wɔ ha.
In his words, the details were clear.	Wɔ ne nsɛm mu no, na nsɛm no mu da hɔ.
I think it’s a little chilly out today.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ awɔw kakra wɔ abɔnten nnɛ.
People are starting to panic about the danger.	Nkurɔfo afi ase rebɔ hu wɔ asiane no ho.
Very good, bad intelligence.	Eye paa, nyansa bɔne.
It looks pretty good.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye yiye.
I just don’t like it.	M’ani nnye ho kɛkɛ.
And we will do it immediately.	Na yɛbɛyɛ no ntɛm ara.
Your day should end well.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo da no ba awiei yiye.
That sounds awesome.	Ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
It seems about timely.	Ɛte sɛ nea bɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bere mu de.
There could be someone else.	Ná obi foforo nso betumi aba.
For something as simple as this.	Wɔ biribi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ eyi ho.
You have to tell me what you have planned.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka nea woayɛ ho nhyehyɛe kyerɛ me.
There are many of us.	Yɛn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
But you seem to know that.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea wunim saa.
He just had it.	Ná ɔwɔ bi kɛkɛ.
It’s cold out here, and you’d be much more comfortable inside.	Awɔw wɔ ha akyi, na anka wo ho bɛtɔ wo kɛse wɔ mu.
The bed in this room is huge.	Mpa a ɛwɔ dan yi mu no yɛ kɛse.
This doesn’t mean anything.	Eyi nkyerɛ hwee.
What matters is that they always do.	Nea ɛho hia ne sɛ wɔyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
Tomorrow would be their last day.	Ná ɔkyena bɛyɛ wɔn da a etwa to.
No one knows if the information is true or not.	Obiara nnim sɛ nsɛm no yɛ nokware anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
The highway is packed.	Ɔkwan kɛse no so ayɛ ma.
Make sure you’re interested in them.	Ma w’ani nnye wɔn ho.
I think he is, too.	Misusuw sɛ ɔno nso te saa.
So the man won.	Enti ɔbarima no dii nkonim.
In the end it wasn’t that bad.	Awiei koraa no na ɛnyɛ bɔne saa.
It’s good for him.	Eye ma no.
I have added it many times.	Mede aka ho mpɛn pii.
Now you know why.	Seesei wunim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Not that you had to.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
At least he could use it a little.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na obetumi de adi dwuma kakra.
He has established it.	Ɔde asi hɔ.
It’s obvious.	Ɛda adi.
He was not happy with the situation at all.	Ná n’ani nnye tebea no ho koraa.
And a job is a job.	Na adwuma bi yɛ adwuma.
I have known him for years.	Mede mfe pii ahu no.
Get involved in it.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu.
He is more like you.	Ɔte sɛ wo kɛse.
That’s not quite the point here.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no koraa wɔ ha.
Living alone is not unpleasant for most people.	Sɛ obi nkutoo tra ase a, ɛnyɛ nea nnipa dodow no ara ani nnye ho.
Take the one you’re going to have with me.	Gye deɛ wobɛka me ho no.
He does a great job and is fast.	Ɔyɛ adwuma kɛse na ɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
No one knows where he is.	Obiara nnim baabi a ɔwɔ.
That’s a danger.	Ɛno yɛ asiane.
You can’t quite understand it, now.	Worentumi nte ase yiye, mprempren.
Obviously, neither does he.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔno nso nyɛ saa.
He quickly moved to the door.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm tu kɔɔ ɔpon no ano.
Two more nights.	Anadwo abien bio.
You can find the course syllabus here.	Wubetumi ahu adesua no adesua nhyehyɛe wɔ ha.
I was in a lot of trouble.	Ná mewɔ ɔhaw kɛse mu.
Even if people don’t believe me it’s true.	Sɛ mpo nkurɔfo nnye me nni a ɛyɛ nokware.
At school, he ate lunch alone.	Wɔ sukuu mu no, na ɔno nkutoo di awia aduan.
Just about everyone else seems to be doing the same.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara a aka no reyɛ saa ara.
That’s what hair does.	Ɛno ne nea ti nhwi yɛ.
That’s right, you said.	Ɛte saa, wokae.
He certainly didn’t know me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na onnim me.
This plan had several problems.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi nyaa ɔhaw ahorow pii.
I don't know for how long.	Minnim bere tenten a wɔde bɛyɛ saa.
Is it necessary?	So ɛho hia?
The same way her mother does.	Ɔkwan koro no ara a ne maame yɛ no.
He has done it for me.	Wayɛ ama me.
I point it out to my wife.	Mede me nsa kyerɛ no so kyerɛ me yere.
Nobody wants him.	Obiara mpɛ no.
Two very important factors are involved.	Nneɛma abien a ɛho hia paa ka ho.
That means you both have to talk about it.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ mo baanu nyinaa ka asɛm no ho asɛm.
And look great.	Na hwɛ kɛse.
You never know what trouble can lead to.	Wunnim nea ɔhaw betumi de aba.
I'm still in it.	Meda so ara wɔ mu.
I couldn’t do anything.	Ná mintumi nyɛ hwee.
I feel cold inside and empty.	Mete nka sɛ awɔw wom wɔ me mu na hwee nni me ho.
But that had nothing to do with the power.	Nanso na ɛno mfa tumi a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho.
The way things think is very important to us.	Sɛnea nneɛma susuw ho no ho hia yɛn yiye.
What I can only describe as a fake document.	Nea metumi aka ho asɛm sɛ ɛyɛ atoro krataa nkutoo.
I want to see him, immediately.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu no, ntɛm ara.
I can see them.	Metumi ahu wɔn.
But, look, there’s nothing wrong with weekend food.	Nanso, hwɛ, mfomso biara nni dapɛn awiei aduan ho.
There was so much to do.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
After all, it was just a head.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na ɛyɛ ti ara kwa.
It may be the other way around.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ ɔkwan foforo so.
They all turned to him.	Wɔn nyinaa dan kɔɔ ne nkyɛn.
And do it again.	Na yɛ bio.
He doesn’t do any of that here, though.	Ɔnyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara wɔ ha, nanso.
Can you.	So wubetumi.
The same people using different names.	Nnipa koro no ara a wɔde din ahorow di dwuma.
It’s ‘me’ doing it.	Ɛyɛ ‘me’ na mereyɛ.
The car will break.	Kar bɛbɔ.
He knows that.	Onim saa.
Somehow, the word always got to him.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na asɛm no kɔ ne nkyɛn bere nyinaa.
Tell him what to do.	Ka nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ kyerɛ no.
He had been forgotten again.	Ná wɔn werɛ afi no bio.
They were all there.	Ná wɔn nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
But it must be done!.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ!.
I was doing both.	Ná mereyɛ nneɛma abien no nyinaa.
There was no one in the house.	Ná obiara nni ofie no mu.
No one else did.	Obi foforo biara anyɛ saa.
I don’t really do that.	Menyɛ saa ankasa.
But he was none of that.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara.
In my house.	Wɔ me fie.
He didn't want to take such a big risk.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho to asiane kɛse a ɛte saa mu.
You can’t get a job anymore.	Worentumi nnya adwuma bio.
Something this article failed to convey.	Biribi a asɛm yi antumi ankyerɛ.
If not, you may not be able to achieve much.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ebia worentumi nnya pii.
But everything looked good, everything looked good.	Nanso na biribiara hwɛ yiye, na biribiara hwɛ yiye.
Maybe he’s interested.	Ebia n’ani gye ho.
It wasn’t a perfect plan.	Na ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe a edi mũ.
However, we do.	Nanso, yɛyɛ saa.
First aid is definitely important.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mmoa a edi kan ho hia.
I'm not sure how long this will go on.	Me nnim bere tenten a eyi bɛkɔ so.
It is very dangerous to drive.	Asiane wom paa sɛ wobɛka kar.
In a way, it is.	Ɔkwan bi so no.
It’s behind us.	Ɛwɔ yɛn akyi.
If he liked it, he could see her.	Sɛ n’ani gye ho a, na obetumi ahu no.
It’s a complex system.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe a ɛyɛ den.
I really didn’t know.	Ankasa na minnim.
Usually it’s how they do it.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛyɛ sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
My gun is already set.	Wɔde me tuo no asi hɔ dedaw.
He is in terrible danger.	Ɔwɔ asiane a ɛyɛ hu mu.
Tell me what’s going on.	Ka nea ɛrekɔ so kyerɛ me.
This is the old part of town.	Eyi ne kurow no fã dedaw no.
His life was in danger.	Ná ne nkwa da asiane mu.
He needs to handle this well.	Ɛsɛ sɛ odi eyi ho dwuma yiye.
I want to know everything about him.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu ne ho biribiara.
That house has been empty for years.	Saa fie no ayɛ nea hwee nni mu mfe pii ni.
There was no one here.	Ná obiara nni ha.
He is a good man.	Ɔyɛ onipa pa.
And even then, many things still don’t work.	Na saa bere no mpo, nneɛma pii da so ara nyɛ adwuma.
That’s bad enough.	Ɛno yɛ bɔne sɛnea ɛsɛ.
While most tend to be real, many are not.	Bere a dodow no ara taa yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa no, pii nyɛ saa.
I don’t want anything to leave the house.	Mempɛ sɛ biribiara mfi fie hɔ.
Do whatever is necessary.	Yɛ nea ɛho hia biara.
The trend was really getting to him.	Ná nea ɛrekɔ so no rekɔ ne nkyɛn ankasa.
I may add to this as time goes on.	Ebia mede bɛka eyi ho bere a bere kɔ so no.
Check this a couple of times a day.	Hwɛ eyi mpɛn abien da biara.
Tell him it happened.	Ka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ asi.
And not in one of them.	Na ɛnyɛ wɔn mu biako mu.
Lots of good stuff.	Nneɛma pa pii.
Go to work for him.	Kɔ adwuma ma no.
No one was willing to talk about the incident.	Ná obiara nni ɔpɛ sɛ ɔbɛka asɛm a esii no ho asɛm.
You are here now.	Wowɔ ha seesei.
He did a good job with it.	Ɔde yɛɛ adwuma pa.
It was very cold.	Ná awɔw wom kɛse.
I realize that surprises you.	Mihu sɛ ɛno ma wo ho dwiriw wo.
He doesn’t do all those things for nothing either.	Ɔnyɛ saa nnwuma no nyinaa kwa nso.
But this is not the case.	Nanso eyi nte saa.
Just the two of us.	Yɛn baanu nkutoo.
The money is on the ground.	Sika no da fam.
You’re so excited.	W’ani agye yiye.
That was just work for him.	Ná ɛno yɛ adwuma ara kwa ma no.
But no one saw him.	Nanso obiara anhu no.
It’s something else.	Ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
Apparently he used to be a lot worse than he is now.	Ɛda adi sɛ kan no na ɔyɛ bɔne kɛse sen sɛnea ɔte mprempren no.
Mine car.	Minni kar.
He set it on the road.	Ɔde sii kwan so.
I didn’t think anything of it at the time.	Saa bere no na minsusuw ho hwee.
Look into that in more detail.	Hwɛ saa asɛm no mu kɔ akyiri.
He didn’t know what his father looked like.	Na onnim sɛnea ne papa te.
Most of the time, you can do what you want.	Mpɛn pii no, wubetumi ayɛ nea wopɛ.
They were good people, too.	Ná wɔyɛ nnipa pa, nso.
The children were still in school.	Ná mmofra no da so ara kɔ sukuu.
So it seems to work for me.	Enti ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma ma me.
All of us.	Yɛn nyinaa.
There is little fresh water	Nsu pa kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ
This works well.	Eyi yɛ adwuma yiye.
Thank you for dinner.	Meda wo ase wɔ anwummere aduan ho.
But we may not be able to do that.	Nanso ebia yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
It seemed to be good.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eye.
These stories are both simple and complex.	Saa nsɛm yi yɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ den.
It is a large portion of the population.	Ɛyɛ nnipa dodow no ara fã kɛse.
Or they used to be.	Anaasɛ na wɔyɛ saa.
And I want to tell you.	Na mepɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo.
There was certainly a problem with his speech.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔhaw bi wɔ ne kasa no mu.
Great power.	Tumi kɛse.
The reasons for this could be so many.	Nea enti a eyi te saa no betumi ayɛ pii saa.
how beautiful she was.	hwɛ sɛnea na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
About.	Fa ho.
At least that’s what they say.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne nea wɔka.
I wasn’t interested in it.	Ná m’ani nnye ho.
The police found nothing.	Polisifo no anhu hwee.
The back door is always in use.	Wɔde akyi pon no di dwuma bere nyinaa.
He was always there for us.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ ma yɛn bere nyinaa.
There is work to be done in the city.	Adwuma wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔ kurow no mu.
But so too many people are very big.	Nanso saa ara na nnipa pii yɛ kɛse paa.
You can see where it is but not where it is going.	Wubetumi ahu baabi a ɛwɔ nanso ɛnyɛ baabi a ɛrekɔ.
More power is always a good thing.	Tumi pii yɛ ade pa bere nyinaa.
My words are true.	Me nsɛm yɛ nokware.
Is it best for everyone.	So ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara ma obiara.
This year's convention was well attended	Nnipa pii baa afe yi nhyiam no ase sen wɔ
He will give you everything he has.	Ɔde biribiara a ɔwɔ bɛma wo.
I couldn’t sleep and you were doing fine.	Na mintumi nna na na woreyɛ yiye.
It must have been about the money.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ sika no ho asɛm.
His mother knew.	Ná ne maame nim.
We are perfect.	Yɛyɛ pɛ.
I have a lot of money and power.	Mewɔ sika ne tumi pii.
Maybe that could work.	Ebia ɛno betumi ayɛ adwuma.
But it is a terrible situation.	Nanso ɛyɛ tebea a ɛyɛ hu.
I think about here.	Misusuw ha ho.
It’s really not that hard.	Ɛnyɛ den saa ankasa.
It is only temporary.	Ɛyɛ bere tiaa mu de nkutoo.
Two hours later, it was all over.	Nnɔnhwerew abien akyi no, na ne nyinaa aba awiei.
And so has everyone else.	Na saa ara na obiara nso ayɛ.
This situation may be the case for both of you.	Ebia tebea yi te saa ma mo baanu nyinaa.
I know that wasn’t easy.	Minim sɛ na ɛno nyɛ mmerɛw.
There is also usually an after party.	Mpɛn pii no, akyi apontow bi nso wɔ hɔ.
The song has a strange story to it.	Dwom no wɔ asɛm bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ho.
It is certainly good to do both.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eye sɛ wobɛyɛ abien no nyinaa.
We all have to do our part.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa yɛ yɛn fam de.
You need to tell him that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka saa kyerɛ no.
In that case .	Wɔ saa tebea no mu no .
She thought it was childish and ugly.	Ná osusuw sɛ ɛyɛ mmofra de, na ɛnyɛ fɛ.
He didn't want to play well with the other kids.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔne mmofra a aka no bedi agoru yiye.
Everyone except him.	Obiara gye ɔno nkutoo.
I've taken myself to work.	Mede me ho akɔ adwuma.
I'm driving you home.	Mede wo kar rekɔ fie.
What is the right thing to do.	Dɛn ne ade a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
But it’s good.	Nanso ɛyɛ papa.
Be careful with your language here.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ wo kasa ho wɔ ha.
There were usually three different tables.	Mpɛn pii no na pon ahorow abiɛsa na ɛwɔ hɔ.
The animal no longer feels its arms or legs.	Aboa no nte ne nsa anaa ne nan nka bio.
One person alone cannot do this.	Onipa biako nkutoo ntumi nyɛ eyi.
Do it quickly.	Yɛ ho ntɛm.
It’s not hard for me.	Ɛnyɛ den mma me.
Once the new channel is established.	Bere a wɔde ɔkwan foforo no asi hɔ no.
I have done enough for two.	Mayɛ nea ɛdɔɔso ama baanu.
I just locked myself in a room.	Mede me ho too dan bi mu kɛkɛ.
So something like that letter would have been .	Enti anka biribi te sɛ saa krataa no bɛyɛ .
At least I find that to be the case.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, mihu sɛ ɛte saa.
That was exciting.	Ná ɛno yɛ anigye.
Were they really?.	So na wɔyɛ ankasa?.
A great little one.	Kakraa kɛse bi.
He leads the way.	Ɔno na odi kwan no anim.
I want to check it out.	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ.
This is the case.	Eyi te saa.
Get your stuff, he says.	Ɔka sɛ, gye wo nneɛma.
If not a door, there is a window somewhere.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɔpon a, mfɛnsere wɔ baabi.
Music is life.	Nnwom yɛ nkwa.
Get out of my car!	Fi me kar mu!
In any case, nothing could be further from the truth.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, biribiara ntumi nkɔ akyiri sen nokware no.
Many things can happen during this time.	Nneɛma pii betumi asi wɔ saa bere yi mu.
Understand me here.	Te me ase wɔ ha.
However, we both knew the truth.	Nanso, na yɛn baanu nyinaa nim nokware no.
It’s all still there, now.	Ne nyinaa da so ara wɔ hɔ, mprempren.
That would be quite a day.	Ɛno bɛyɛ da koro koraa.
The water supply was great.	Ná nsu a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ kɛse.
This one, though, by the way.	Nanso, eyi de, ɔkwan bi so no.
A beautiful arrangement.	Nhyehyɛe a ɛyɛ fɛ.
We both stare at each other.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa hwɛ yɛn ho yɛn ho denneennen.
He was the most independent of the independent producers.	Ná ɔno na ɔde ne ho sen biara wɔ wɔn a wɔyɛ nneɛma a wɔde wɔn ho no mu.
But they too are not satisfied with the current situation.	Nanso wɔn nso wɔn ani nnye mprempren tebea no ho.
I don’t want to understand.	Mempɛ sɛ mete ase.
There must be a letter.	Ɛsɛ sɛ krataa bi wɔ hɔ.
There’s really nothing to do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ankasa.
That’s the other way around.	Ɛno ne ɔkwan foforo no.
It should be a lot of fun.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
Good morning, everyone.	Anɔpa pa, obiara.
He knew it well now.	Ná onim no yiye mprempren.
For the most part, he never needs to touch her again.	Ne fã kɛse no ara no, enhia sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka bio da.
For a while at least, he was happy.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, bere tiaa bi mu no, na n’ani gye.
The team was doing well.	Ná kuw no reyɛ adwuma yiye.
The more I look at you, the more I like you.	Dodow a mehwɛ wo no, dodow no ara na m’ani gye wo ho.
I love everything you do.	M’ani gye biribiara a woyɛ ho.
At least most of them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔn mu dodow no ara.
He leaned in a little deeper.	Ɔde ne ho too mu kɔɔ akyiri kakra.
Such a great book.	Nhoma kɛse a ɛte saa.
His, too, is the same.	Ne de no, saa ara.
No one else can either.	Obi foforo nso ntumi nyɛ saa.
You and your mother.	Wo ne wo maame.
The story you see is actually the first part of three.	Asɛm a wuhu no yɛ abiɛsa no fã a edi kan ankasa.
And that it is information.	Na sɛ́ ɛyɛ nsɛm.
There is no room for that here.	Ɛno ho kwan biara nni ha.
There is enough for everyone.	Ɛdɔɔso ma obiara.
Or a system.	Anaasɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
It’s a thrill.	Ɛyɛ anigye.
You’ll be interested.	W’ani begye ho.
But he was very much like that.	Nanso na ɔte saa paa.
The average travel time was about two hours.	Ná bere a nnipa pii de tu kwan no bɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abien.
Everything is in the mind.	Biribiara wɔ adwene mu.
Everyone says that.	Obiara ka saa.
It looks beautiful.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
I am vulnerable to it all.	Meyɛ mmerɛw wɔ ne nyinaa ho.
He is a very nice person.	Ɔyɛ onipa a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
You will become great.	Wobɛyɛ kɛse.
Make some friends while you’re here.	Fa nnamfo bi bere a wowɔ ha no.
And so he will do it.	Na saa ara na ɔbɛyɛ.
Was it you?.	So na ɛyɛ wo?.
That was no accident.	Na ɛno nyɛ akwanhyia.
We can talk about it.	Yebetumi aka ho asɛm.
Or maybe he could.	Anaasɛ ebia na obetumi.
Is this a dog?	So eyi yɛ ɔkraman?
So never say never!.	Enti nka da sɛ da!.
Very, very good.	Eye paa, paa.
In your case, it seems to have.	Wɔ wo tebea no mu no, ɛte sɛ nea ayɛ saa.
Look at who they work for.	Hwɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ adwuma ma wɔn no.
It was going to be a long evening.	Ná ɛbɛyɛ anwummere tenten bi.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.	Mfomso, mfomso, mfomso.
And that is untrue.	Na ɛte saa a ɛnyɛ nokware.
But every day was a little easier.	Nanso na da biara da yɛ mmerɛw kakra.
It’s not common but it does exist.	Ɛnyɛ nea abu so nanso ɛwɔ hɔ.
He was a beautiful boy.	Ná ɔyɛ abarimaa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I can’t see him in the house, either.	Mintumi nhu no wɔ fie hɔ, nso.
So, that got me thinking.	Enti, ɛno maa misusuw ho.
Their words matter.	Wɔn nsɛm ho hia.
But you’ll enjoy it.	Nanso w’ani begye ho.
You never do that.	Wonyɛ saa da.
There is not a single thing.	Ade biako mpo nni hɔ.
That feels interesting.	Ɛno te nka sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
I want to do it in a similar way.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ no ɔkwan a ɛte saa ara so.
It’s a simple one.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Some of my clothes were in it.	Ná me ntade no bi wɔ mu.
What is here is life.	Nea ɛwɔ ha ne nkwa.
Some of the work was easy.	Ná adwuma no bi yɛ mmerɛw.
You can’t do anything.	Worentumi nyɛ hwee.
So your eyes are working.	Enti w’ani reyɛ adwuma.
As they both know.	Sɛnea wɔn baanu nyinaa nim.
A wonderfully awesome idea.	Adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛyɛ hu.
He must have been completely true to himself.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ wayɛ nokware koraa ama ne ho.
I can see that.	Metumi ahu saa.
You've worked yourself up to a very nice place.	Woayɛ wo ho adwuma akɔ baabi a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
When you want it.	Bere a wopɛ no.
Maybe that’s it.	Ebia ɛno ne saa.
There is really only one person this can be.	Onipa biako pɛ na ɔwɔ hɔ ankasa a eyi betumi ayɛ.
Please tell me not this.	Mesrɛ wo ka kyerɛ me sɛ ɛnyɛ eyi.
My head hurts from that work alone.	Me ti yɛ me yaw wɔ saa adwuma no nkutoo ho.
As long as their children stayed out of trouble, they were happy.	Bere tenten a wɔn mma no tra ɔhaw mu no, na wɔn ani gye.
He had had a good time with her.	Ná ɔne no anya bere pa.
I didn’t know anything.	Ná minnim hwee.
There was no one else.	Na obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
Too much time spent on the phone.	Bere pii a wɔde di dwuma wɔ telefon so.
All afternoon and most of the night.	Awia mũ no nyinaa ne anadwo no fã kɛse no ara.
It’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
It’s not just today.	Ɛnyɛ nnɛ ara kwa.
This is a quick one.	Eyi yɛ ntɛmntɛm.
A city is not a city.	Kurow nyɛ kurow.
The same is true of us.	Saa ara na yɛn nso yɛ.
And think about it.	Na susuw ho hwɛ.
It’s great and inexpensive.	Ɛyɛ kɛse na ne bo nyɛ den.
He just exists.	Ɔwɔ hɔ ara kwa.
It is indeed the case.	Ɛte saa ampa.
Go right away.	Kɔ ntɛm ara.
If anyone can bring it.	Sɛ obi betumi de aba a.
He would do that.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ saa.
We put it on the road.	Yɛde sii kwan so.
Those were happy days.	Ná ɛno yɛ nna a ɛyɛ anigye.
I like his opinion.	M’ani gye n’adwene ho.
There was no one to help him.	Ná obiara nni hɔ a ɔbɛboa no.
I get you one.	Me nsa ka wo biako.
I hope that is not the case with you.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ saa wɔ mo fam.
The man's eyes were gone.	Ná ɔbarima no ani nni hɔ bio.
I’m happy for him.	M’ani agye ma no.
I just wanted a dog.	Ná mepɛ ɔkraman kɛkɛ.
Just like the last time.	Te sɛ bere a etwa to no ara pɛ.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na wɔyɛ eyi.
It was extremely cold last night.	Ná awɔw wom kɛse anadwo a etwaam no.
That doesn’t sound good.	Ɛno nte sɛ nea eye.
In real time.	Wɔ bere ankasa mu.
That test found no problems.	Saa sɔhwɛ no anhu ɔhaw biara.
I have to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
At that point the work runs .	Saa bere no na adwuma no tu mmirika .
He was doing well.	Ná ɔreyɛ yiye.
That just made him stronger.	Ɛno maa ne ho yɛɛ den kɛse ara kwa.
I was taken down too soon.	Wɔde me sii fam ntɛm dodo.
Clearly, there was much more to learn.	Ɛda adi sɛ na pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
You can do it with your kids.	Wubetumi ne wo mma ayɛ no.
On the other hand, though, it’s pretty amazing.	Nanso, ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
Everything he does, he does well.	Biribiara a ɔyɛ no, ɔyɛ no yiye.
Your mother gave it to you.	Wo maame na ɔde maa wo.
Here you are, child.	Wo ni, abofra.
You know, something pretty cool.	Wunim, biribi a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I wonder where he lives.	Misusuw baabi a ɔte ho.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
Both have strong hands.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa wɔ nsa a ɛyɛ den.
I have it in me.	Mewɔ no.
In many cases.	Wɔ nsɛm pii mu no.
I’m not sure what to do.	M’ani gyee ho.
I can still do that.	Meda so ara betumi ayɛ saa.
All of those things are there.	Saa nneɛma no nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
This policy will only be valid for a limited time.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi bɛyɛ adwuma bere tiaa bi pɛ.
You will work best with people you know.	Wo ne nnipa a wunim wɔn bɛyɛ adwuma a eye sen biara.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani gye ho saa.
Just a squirrel.	Ɔkraman bi kɛkɛ.
But that was last year.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ afe a etwaam no.
It is best to act quickly.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ obi bɛyɛ biribi ntɛm.
They had been set up.	Ná wɔde wɔn asi hɔ.
Do something about it now!	Yɛ ho biribi mprempren!
The next claim is simple but important.	Nea edi hɔ a wɔka no yɛ mmerɛw nanso ɛho hia.
There are many types of sexuality.	Nna ho nsɛm ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
Book well first.	Di kan yɛ nhoma yiye.
The kids had their own plans.	Ná mmofra no wɔ wɔn ankasa nhyehyɛe ahorow.
I didn’t want to hear it again.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete bio.
I have a lot of different things in it.	Mewɔ nneɛma ahorow pii wɔ mu.
No one seems to have any power.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara nni hɔ a ɔwɔ tumi biara.
Fill me with a new one.	Hyɛ me ma foforo.
This was about midnight and time.	Ná eyi yɛ bɛyɛ anadwo fã ne bere.
He will be relieved.	Ne ho bɛtɔ no.
It’s a great opportunity for you.	Ɛyɛ hokwan kɛse ma wo.
We enjoyed it.	Yɛn ani gyee ho.
He knows when it is.	Onim bere a ɛte saa.
If it’s something simple, like a monster.	Sɛ ɛyɛ biribi a ɛnyɛ den, te sɛ aboa kɛse bi a.
Where no one could see.	Baabi a na obiara ntumi nhu.
This doesn’t work.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
Enough now, though.	Nanso, ɛdɔɔso mprempren.
That’s the way things are.	Saa ara na nneɛma te.
It seemed like enough at the time.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛdɔɔso saa bere no.
But that is not true.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ nokware.
I think there is a mistake here.	Misusuw sɛ mfomso bi wɔ ha.
This meeting will take place next month.	Saa nhyiam yi bɛkɔ so ɔsram a edi hɔ no.
However, this city completely blew me away.	Nanso, kurow yi bɔɔ me koraa.
He eats almost anything.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ odi biribiara.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!.	Meda wo ase, meda wo ase, meda wo ase!.
But it still doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛda so ara mfa ho.
And more if we can find it.	Na pii sɛ yebetumi anya bi a.
We can do this.	Yebetumi ayɛ eyi.
This is a great thing.	Eyi yɛ ade kɛse.
You are so well done!.	Woayɛ no yiye paa!.
This movie doesn’t.	Sini yi nyɛ saa.
And the present case.	Na mprempren asɛm no nso.
All my children worked there.	Ná me mma no nyinaa yɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ.
I really get it.	Me nsa ka no ankasa.
I'm still there.	Meda so ara wɔ hɔ.
But in this case, it’s really true.	Nanso wɔ eyi mu no, ɛyɛ nokware ankasa.
We can help you with this task.	Yebetumi aboa wo wɔ adwuma yi mu.
The room was very good value.	Ná dan no bo yɛ papa yiye.
The whole thing is amazing.	Asɛm no nyinaa yɛ nwonwa.
She wanted to be nice to him.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ fɛ ma no.
Even in his sleep, he knows where he is.	Wɔ ne nna mu mpo no, onim baabi a ɔte.
He was just that guy.	Ná ɔyɛ saa ɔbarima no ara kwa.
Many things don’t work as well as they used to.	Nneɛma pii ntumi nyɛ adwuma yiye sɛnea na ɛte kan no.
That he was in it too.	Sɛ na ɔno nso wɔ mu.
Anyone else remember him?.	Obi foforo bi nso kae no?.
Not for me, though.	Ɛnyɛ me de, nanso.
Otherwise it doesn’t matter.	Anyɛ saa a ɛnyɛ hwee.
I want to be here.	Mepɛ sɛ mewɔ ha.
It’s very beautiful stuff.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
However, it is not difficult at all.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ den koraa.
I don’t know where to focus.	Minnim baabi a mede m’adwene besi so.
A snake bit him.	Ɔwɔ bi kaa no.
It is not so.	Ɛnte saa.
That same morning, he told me.	Saa anɔpa no ara, ɔka kyerɛɛ me.
What else can he do.	Dɛn bio na obetumi ayɛ.
I don’t know what he’s doing.	Minnim nea ɔreyɛ.
And you didn’t know.	Na na wunnim.
You can’t use both at the same time.	Worentumi mfa abien no nyinaa nni dwuma bere koro mu.
He wants it to be bad.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne.
They shouldn’t have done that either.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa nso.
What you do matters.	Nea woyɛ no ho hia.
That had to be what we had to do.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
We are in town for the next two days.	Yɛwɔ kurow no mu nna abien a edi hɔ no.
I have simplified the ingredients a bit.	Mede nneɛma a wɔde yɛ aduan no ayɛ mmerɛw kakra.
He is with his mother.	Ɔne ne maame wɔ hɔ.
In the background.	Wɔ akyi no.
But that is not possible.	Nanso ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Anything it would be.	Ade biara a anka ɛbɛyɛ.
No doubt there will be more news.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nsɛm foforo bɛba.
That girl over there is really pretty.	Saa abeawa a ɔwɔ hɔ no ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
I have them, but not without a lot of work.	Mewɔ wɔn, nanso ɛnyɛ a adwuma pii nnim.
It had been difficult for everyone.	Ná ayɛ den ama obiara.
This is our time.	Eyi ne yɛn bere.
The truth is still there.	Nokware no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Think about it really.	Susuw ho ankasa.
Everyone knows that winter is the coldest season.	Obiara nim sɛ awɔw bere ne bere a awɔw wom sen biara.
Some comments here are important.	Nsɛm bi a wɔka wɔ ha ho hia.
There was no problem.	Ná ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
But jobs aren’t the whole story.	Nanso nnwuma nyɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
This situation is strange.	Saa tebea yi yɛ nwonwa.
A masterpiece of movie trailer work.	Sini mu nsɛm a wɔde kyerɛ ho adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There was something else.	Ná ade foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
Play whatever game he wants you to play.	Di agoru biara a ɔpɛ sɛ woyɛ.
However, we all know that you never, ever know.	Nanso, yɛn nyinaa nim sɛ wunnim da, wunnim da.
I don't think so.	Misusuw sɛ ɛnte saa.
As such, it may contain errors.	Sɛnea ɛte no, ebia mfomso ahorow wom.
You have a home.	Wowɔ fie.
Only human testing.	Nnipa sɔhwɛ nkutoo.
Not that it was just my fault.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ me mfomso ara kwa.
Maybe not as hard as some of the recent years past.	Ebia ɛnyɛ den te sɛ nnansa yi mfe a atwam no bi.
And you’ll be fine, too.	Na wo nso wobɛyɛ yiye.
I want to hear what he has to say about it.	Mepɛ sɛ mete nea ɔwɔ ka fa ho.
He leaned out the window.	Ɔde ne ho too mfɛnsere no mu.
I doubt that is the only one.	Migye kyim sɛ ɛno nkutoo ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ.
What a year it is.	Afe bɛn ara ni.
Their names say it all.	Wɔn din ka ne nyinaa.
However, time was scarce.	Nanso, na bere ho yɛ na.
The man's hair looked perfect.	Ná ɔbarima no ti nhwi no te sɛ nea edi mũ.
There may still be a way.	Ebia ɔkwan bi da so ara wɔ hɔ.
How the mind works.	Sɛnea adwene no yɛ adwuma.
It’s two things.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma abien.
This is not just how it works.	Eyi nyɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
I can relate to that.	Metumi ne saa asɛm no ayɛ adwene.
So happy day.	Enti anigye da.
Do your homework first.	Di kan yɛ wo fie nnwuma.
Maybe this was timing.	Ebia na eyi reyɛ bere.
Go to us for a walk.	Kɔ yɛn nkyɛn.
It had only three legs.	Ná ɛwɔ nan abiɛsa pɛ.
The reality was pretty simple.	Ná nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
You can’t see him.	Worentumi nhu no.
I agree with him.	Me ne no yɛ adwene.
The next one is pretty simple.	Nea edi hɔ no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
People need jobs.	Nkurɔfo hia nnwuma.
Everything else is the same as before.	Nneɛma a aka nyinaa te sɛ kan no.
In his house	Wɔ ne fie .
This presence was not an animal.	Ná saa baabi a ɔwɔ yi nyɛ aboa.
Everything is perfect.	Biribiara yɛ pɛ.
Cycling was perfect for me.	Ná sakre a wɔde tu kwan no yɛ nea edi mũ ma me.
Tomorrow there is more to see.	Ɔkyena nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a yebetumi ahu.
He didn't want to hear the details.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔte nsɛm no mu nsɛm.
None of them did anything about it.	Wɔn mu biara anyɛ ho hwee.
This is the last year of school.	Eyi ne afe a etwa to wɔ sukuu mu.
We are very.	Yɛyɛ paa.
The kids were anything but cute.	Ná mmofra no yɛ biribiara gye sɛ wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
Perhaps he did.	Ebia ɔyɛɛ saa.
He didn't know what else to do.	Ná onnim nea ɔyɛ bio.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na eyi te saa.
It’s a hot day.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ hyew.
Time travels.	Bere tu kwan.
It wasn’t an easy task.	Na ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I want him to have a long career.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma tenten.
Than what is currently available.	Sen nea ɛwɔ hɔ mprempren.
Like a movie.	Te sɛ sini bi.
If you could only see what that means.	Sɛ wubetumi ahu nea ɛno kyerɛ nkutoo a.
Everyone talked about it, but no one did anything.	Obiara kaa ho asɛm, nanso obiara anyɛ hwee.
Please can someone do that.	Mesrɛ sɛ obi betumi ayɛ saa.
The information is available among stakeholders.	Nsɛm no wɔ hɔ wɔ wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ adwuma no mu no mu.
It’s dangerous.	Ɛyɛ asiane.
Not that he will but still.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ nanso ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
He glanced at his hands.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ne nsa so.
The school offers half-day and full-day kindergarten.	Sukuu no de da fã ne da mũ nyinaa mmofra sukuu ma.
But there is hope.	Nanso anidaso wɔ hɔ.
There are some good things here.	Nneɛma pa bi wɔ ha.
However, that’s not the only thing to consider.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo ne ade a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
Maybe he was the one.	Ebia na ɔte saa.
And in that case, it was the same thing.	Na wɔ saa asɛm no mu no, na ɛyɛ ade koro no ara.
You say it, it should be.	Woka no, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
He seems to know nothing.	Ɛte sɛ nea onnim hwee.
An odd idea comes through from time to time.	Adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa bi ba sen bere ne bere mu.
You have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
Than anywhere else.	Sen baabi foforo biara.
Where is my fault.	Ɛhe na me mfomso wɔ.
I get the dog.	Me nsa ka ɔkraman no.
But you are not an animal.	Nanso wonyɛ aboa.
Their faces were visible.	Ná wɔn anim da adi.
The hands are soft.	Nsa no yɛ mmerɛw.
It is a graphic representation of language.	Ɛyɛ kasa ho mfonini a wɔde mfonini ayɛ.
Just down the road.	Ɔkwan no so kɛkɛ.
I am very worried about him.	Ne ho asɛm haw me paa.
I was worried about what the morning would bring.	Ná nea anɔpa no de bɛba no haw me.
Work boots with house dress.	Adwuma mpaboa a ofie atade wom.
I believe we can get there.	Migye di sɛ yebetumi adu hɔ.
That would be very unlike you.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nea ɛnte sɛ wo koraa.
This time, a different approach was used.	Saa bere yi de, wɔde ɔkwan foforo dii dwuma.
There is plenty of food here, but there are still some shortages.	Aduan pii wɔ ha, nanso nneɛma bi a ɛho ayɛ na da so ara wɔ hɔ.
He wanted it to be true.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
It was a short-term experience.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi.
He was definitely in way over his head.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔwɔ kwan so wɔ ne ti so.
I know you are there.	Minim sɛ wowɔ hɔ.
He had a little help.	Ná ɔwɔ mmoa kakra.
That’s why we do what we do.	Ɛno nti na yɛyɛ nea yɛyɛ no.
He doesn’t care what you think of him.	Nea wususuw wɔ ne ho no mfa ne ho.
Lots of animals, and they’re beautiful.	Mmoa pii, na wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
It’s not limited to that one option.	Ɛnyɛ saa ɔkwan biako no nkutoo so na ɛwɔ hɔ.
There was some back and forth.	Na anim ne akyi bi wɔ hɔ.
And he was my father too.	Na ɔno nso yɛ me papa.
Hope you enjoy it!!!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w'ani begye ho!!!.
Like yours, here.	Te sɛ wo de no, ha.
The school is going on.	Sukuu no rekɔ so.
How terrible this was!	Hwɛ sɛnea na eyi yɛ hu!
If nothing else, it does.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ biribi foforo biara a, ɛyɛ saa.
However, it is not us.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ yɛn.
I told him to smile.	Meka kyerɛɛ no.
Timing is everything.	Bere a wɔde yɛ adwuma no yɛ biribiara.
She is very beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
That’s a lot of it.	Ɛno yɛ pii.
He was self-conscious.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ ne ho so.
He could be anyone.	Ná obetumi ayɛ obiara.
It was absolutely amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
He seemed to be gone.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onni hɔ.
However, most stay.	Nanso, dodow no ara tra hɔ.
The kids wear amazing costumes.	Mmofra no hyɛ ntade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
We have the same opinion.	Yɛn nso yɛwɔ adwene koro.
It seemed like the best idea.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea adwene a eye sen biara.
It was an accident.	Ná ɛyɛ akwanhyia bi.
But he wasn’t happy with her.	Nanso na n’ani nnye ne ho.
Maybe there is, too.	Ebia ɛwɔ hɔ nso.
It was a wonderful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Maybe they do.	Ebia wɔyɛ saa.
Can you play this song?	So wubetumi abɔ dwom yi?
Or make music.	Anaasɛ yɛ nnwom.
I don’t like this approach.	M’ani nnye saa kwan yi ho.
His leather jacket felt nice to the touch.	Ná ne atade a wɔde aboa nhoma ayɛ no yɛ fɛ bere a obi de ne nsa ka no.
He never wanted to do that.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa da.
I already feel very happy.	Mete anigye kɛse nka dedaw.
They are completely fake.	Wɔyɛ atoro koraa.
He had a terrifying look in his eyes.	Ná ɔwɔ n’ani so a ɛyɛ hu.
Expensive, but excellent quality.	Ne bo yɛ den, nanso ɛyɛ papa yiye.
You know we used to be friends.	Wunim sɛ kan no na yɛyɛ nnamfo.
What a lucky man he is.	Ɔbarima a ɔwɔ anigye bɛn ara ni.
My mother is still here.	Me maame da so ara wɔ ha.
No job has ever made me happy.	Adwuma biara nni hɔ a ama m’ani agye da.
He would help her and she would help him.	Ná ɔbɛboa no na ɔno nso aboa no.
That keeps my mother busy.	Ɛno ma me maame kɔ so yɛ adwuma.
It seemed too final.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea etwa to dodo.
I want to paint.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ mfonini.
You could argue otherwise.	Wubetumi agye akyinnye sɛ ɛnte saa.
His hair is short.	Ne ti nhwi yɛ tiaa.
It just doesn’t exist.	Ɛnyɛ hɔ ara kwa.
He was a very tall man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima tenten paa.
But we shouldn’t be doing that.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Here are the results.	Nea afi mu aba no ni.
That’s a good day.	Ɛno yɛ da pa.
There are several problems with this approach.	Ɔhaw ahorow pii wɔ saa kwan yi ho.
The characters are also very poor.	Nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no nso di hia yiye.
There was a party.	Ná apontow bi wɔ hɔ.
So thank you in advance.	Enti di kan da mo ase.
I can take you the rest of the way.	Metumi de wo akɔ ɔkwan a aka no so.
He was very strong.	Ná ɔyɛ den yiye.
And yet, it’s almost always packed.	Na nanso, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nnipa ahyɛ mu ma bere nyinaa.
He was the nicest person.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ sen biara.
This is what I was told.	Eyi ne nea wɔka kyerɛɛ me.
At the time, no one knew exactly what they were doing.	Saa bere no na obiara nnim nea wɔyɛ no yiye.
You’ve been so good!	Woayɛ papa paa!
Everything goes so fast.	Biribiara kɔ ntɛmntɛm saa.
But that doesn’t work anymore.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ adwuma bio.
As are your two children.	Sɛnea wo mma baanu no te no.
Anyone else have any thoughts on the matter?.	Obi foforo bi wɔ adwene bi wɔ asɛm no ho?.
He was interested in child psychology.	Ná n’ani gye mmofra adwene ho adesua ho.
At least not like it used to be.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ sɛnea na ɛte kan no.
Something like the one below.	Biribi a ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ ase ha yi.
He wanted me to go home with him.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ me ne no kɔ fie.
Just a little bit.	Kakraa bi kɛkɛ.
There is a long list of them.	Wɔn din tenten bi wɔ hɔ.
Even they believe they do.	Wɔn mpo gye di sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
The scenery was spectacular.	Ná nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ nwonwa.
He was always like that.	Ná ɔte saa bere nyinaa.
For food or clothing.	Wɔ aduan anaa ntade ho.
Don’t lose sight of the road.	Mma w’ani mfi kwan so.
His enthusiasm for his animals did not go unnoticed.	Anigye a na ɔwɔ wɔ ne mmoa ho no ankɔ so ankɔ so.
People criticized his plans.	Nkurɔfo kasa tiaa ne nhyehyɛe ahorow no.
His mother need not have worried.	Ná enhia sɛ ne maame haw ne ho.
It was really bad.	Ná ɛyɛ bɔne ankasa.
I don’t go out with anyone.	Me ne obiara nkɔ abɔnten.
They were holding hands.	Ná wɔde wɔn nsa abɔ mu.
No one has it.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔwɔ bi.
The most structural is closer to automobile production.	Nea ɛwɔ nhyehyɛe mu kɛse no bɛn kar a wɔyɛ no.
So that you can watch some time.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wubetumi ahwɛ bere bi.
And it’s because of me.	Na ɛyɛ me nti.
That it was really just another story.	Sɛ na ɛyɛ asɛm foforo ara kwa ankasa.
That is not the point now.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no mprempren.
So much fun.	Enti anigye kɛse.
This is your problem.	Eyi wo haw.
The new metropolis was overwhelming.	Ná kurow kɛse foforo no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
But it all seemed to end well.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea ne nyinaa baa awiei yiye.
There is no other way.	Ɔkwan foforo biara nni hɔ.
Which I just don't know what to say.	Nea minnim nea mɛka ara kwa.
This was no way.	Ná eyi nyɛ ɔkwan biara.
Food and water were provided during the experiment.	Wɔde aduan ne nsu maa wɔ sɔhwɛ no mu.
You bring that up.	Wode saa asɛm no ba.
And I’m sorry.	Na m’ani.
So he just put it there.	Enti ɔde too hɔ ara kwa.
Consider several important factors.	Susuw nneɛma pii a ɛho hia.
This was impossible.	Ná eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
It’s easy to do.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
For one thing, be careful.	Ade biako ne sɛ hwɛ yiye.
You are completely wrong.	Woayɛ mfomso koraa.
All life does that.	Nkwa nyinaa yɛ saa.
Our only boy.	Yɛn abarimaa koro pɛ.
Just a movie.	Sini bi kɛkɛ.
They do a job.	Wɔyɛ adwuma bi.
See if you can follow this.	Hwɛ sɛ wubetumi adi eyi akyi anaa.
It looks really good.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye ankasa.
He seems to think it’s my fault.	Ɛte sɛ nea osusuw sɛ ɛyɛ me mfomso.
Even.	Mpo.
Maybe, a little bit.	Ebia, kakra.
I expect the same from you.	Mehwɛ kwan saa ara fi wo hɔ.
Or he shouldn’t have.	Anaasɛ na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Old projects are new again.	Nnwuma dedaw a wɔde asi hɔ no yɛ foforo bio.
I didn’t want to sleep.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meda.
I made a statement.	Meyɛɛ asɛm bi.
That was a lot of fun.	Ná ɛno yɛ anigye kɛse.
Those images still haunt me.	Saa mfonini ahorow no da so ara haw me.
What is the weakest part of any car?	Dɛn ne kar biara fã a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sen biara?
You need to talk to him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no kasa.
The music is awesome.	Nnwom no yɛ hu.
I'll give him something to take home.	Mede biribi bɛma no a ɔde bɛkɔ fie.
My pain seems to be going away.	Ɛte sɛ nea me yaw no rekɔ.
I gave him everything.	Mede biribiara maa no.
So good, until the end.	Enti eye, kosi awiei.
It’s gone from my mind.	Afi m’adwene mu akɔ.
We should do the same.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa.
Everything was working just fine.	Na biribiara yɛ adwuma yiye ara kwa.
I also like how this game controls itself now.	M’ani gye sɛnea saa agoru yi di so mprempren nso ho.
But it looks good.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea eye.
But if a man can, he will.	Nanso sɛ onipa tumi a, ɔbɛyɛ.
I was once a human mother.	Bere bi na meyɛ onipa na.
Man, you might have been there.	Onipa, ebia na wowɔ hɔ.
Not touching him.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa bɛka no.
There are a lot of people going on.	Nnipa pii na ɛrekɔ so.
So much more to be done.	Enti pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
You do that a lot these days.	Woyɛ saa pii nnansa yi.
However, these controls are expensive.	Nanso, saa nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma yi gye sika pii.
It works for me.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ma me.
Almost no one goes there today.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara nkɔ hɔ nnɛ.
Just be yourself.	Yɛ wo ho ara kwa.
But do it right.	Nanso yɛ no yiye.
Perhaps it would be better if they did.	Ebia sɛ wɔyɛ saa a, ɛbɛyɛ papa.
Probably not much.	Ebia ɛnyɛ pii.
The time has come to sign off.	Bere adu sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa hyɛ ase.
He kicked the pavement.	Ɔde ne nan bɔɔ kwan no so.
I know everything he does.	Minim biribiara a ɔyɛ.
That’s what has happened here.	Ɛno ne nea asi wɔ ha.
He knew someone was in the room.	Ná onim sɛ obi wɔ dan no mu.
Or the last few days, if you will.	Anaasɛ nna kakraa a atwam no, sɛ wopɛ a.
He felt it too.	Ɔno nso tee nka.
These two situations are essentially the same.	Tebea abien yi yɛ ade koro ankasa.
I didn’t want to see anyone.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu obiara.
We are at the bottom of the projects.	Yɛwɔ nnwuma no ase.
They had to go too.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn nso kɔ.
I certainly understood when there was nothing else to do.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ metee ase bere a na biribiara nni hɔ a mɛyɛ bio no.
I want to know what is going on.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so.
The best of the best this weekend.	Nea eye sen biara wɔ nea eye sen biara mu dapɛn awiei yi.
Provide necessary funds.	Fa sika a ɛho hia ma.
She loved being with him.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔne no bɛbɔ.
These days, he's a bit of a recluse.	Nna yi, ɔyɛ obi a ɔde ne ho hyɛ ne ho kakra.
He had to live with that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne saa asɛm no tra ase.
There were no cars, no one.	Ná kar biara nni hɔ, na obiara nni hɔ.
It’s all about the dog.	Ne nyinaa fa ɔkraman no ho.
Will do it again.	Bɛyɛ bio.
The only problem was getting them there.	Ɔhaw biako pɛ a na ɛwɔ hɔ ne sɛ wɔde wɔn bɛkɔ hɔ.
Give me that eye.	Na eye ma me.
Some clothes look good when they are new.	Ntade bi hwɛ yiye sɛ ɛyɛ foforo.
Sex will be good.	Nna bɛyɛ papa.
This is incredibly important.	Eyi ho hia ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This is a big deal for you.	Eyi yɛ asɛm kɛse ma wo.
No one can see us here.	Obiara ntumi nhu yɛn wɔ ha.
Maybe he should have done that.	Ebia na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
What a huge mistake.	Mfomso kɛse bɛn ara ni.
One thing you need to know is power.	Ade biako a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu ne tumi a obi wɔ.
It’s still my fault.	Ɛda so ara yɛ me mfomso.
This last week.	Eyi dapɛn a etwaam no.
It doesn’t happen anymore.	Ɛnyɛ bio.
Not in this case.	Ɛnyɛ saa asɛm yi mu.
There were hardly any police at the time.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na polisifo biara nni hɔ saa bere no.
This man could have been dangerous to me.	Anka ɔbarima yi betumi ayɛ asiane ama me.
I think everyone needs to look out for themselves.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ obiara hwɛ ne ho yiye.
The first approach.	Ɔkwan a edi kan.
And watch the fun begin.	Na hwɛ sɛnea anigye no fi ase.
But for the most part it was good.	Nanso fã kɛse no ara no na eye.
He didn’t want anything to go wrong tonight.	Na ɔmpɛ sɛ biribiara bɛkɔ bɔne mu anadwo yi.
The pictures are amazing.	Mfonini ahorow no yɛ nwonwa.
He is doing very well.	Ɔreyɛ yiye paa.
As someone said, he doesn’t.	Sɛnea obi kae no, ɔnyɛ saa.
And that was a mistake, too.	Na ɛno nso yɛ mfomso.
And, there is a lot of truth in that.	Na, nokware pii wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
I'm really into this.	Mede me ho ahyɛ eyi mu ankasa.
That used to be so easy.	Kan no na ɛno yɛ mmerɛw saa.
In his house but not in his bedroom.	Wɔ ne fie nanso ɛnyɛ ne mpa so.
She was a good time girl.	Ná ɔyɛ abeawa a ɔyɛ bere pa.
This has been great.	Eyi ayɛ kɛse.
We don’t need to do that here.	Ɛho nhia sɛ yɛyɛ saa wɔ ha.
There are so many stories and stories today.	Nsɛm ne nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ nnɛ.
This is how children play.	Eyi ne sɛnea mmofra di agoru.
We have time.	Yɛwɔ bere.
In other words, it is what it is.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛyɛ nea ɛte.
It was the most amazing thing to think about.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen biara a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
I'm not very good at it.	Menyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw kɛse wɔ mu.
However, this project did not work.	Nanso, saa adwuma yi anyɛ adwuma.
On the one hand, it was a good idea.	Ɔkwan biako so no, na ɛyɛ adwene pa.
There was a lot of excitement in the city.	Na anigye pii wɔ kurow no mu.
I hope to enjoy you more again.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ m’ani begye mo ho kɛse bio.
You got me at a bad time.	Wo nyaa me wɔ bere bɔne bi mu.
I want to hear what people think.	Mepɛ sɛ mete nea nkurɔfo susuw.
Lots of power for them.	Tumi pii ma wɔn.
All in all, it was a very enjoyable evening.	Ne nyinaa mu no, na ɛyɛ anwummere a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
This still looks so fresh and vibrant.	Eyi da so ara te sɛ nea ɛyɛ foforo na ɛyɛ hyew saa.
He had been doing it for too long.	Ná wayɛ no akyɛ dodo.
I don’t have to do this.	Ɛho nhia sɛ meyɛ eyi.
This book has a terrible reputation.	Saa nhoma yi wɔ din a ɛyɛ hu.
But that wasn’t all.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo.
This was something else that had happened two years earlier.	Ná eyi yɛ biribi foforo a na asi mfe abien a atwam ni.
At least that’s according to my mother.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne sɛnea me maame kyerɛ no.
It has been an exciting job for you.	Ayɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ anigye ama wo.
Everything looks the same old, same old.	Biribiara te sɛ dedaw koro no ara, dedaw koro no ara.
And I was the only one in front of his.	Na na me nkutoo na ɔwɔ ne de no anim.
Watch how people treat you.	Hwɛ sɛnea nkurɔfo ne wo di no.
That was three days ago.	Ɛno yɛ nnansa a atwam ni.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnte saa.
There was an accident on a busy road.	Akwanhyia bi sii wɔ kar kwan bi a nnipa pii fa so so.
No one else was behind.	Ná obi foforo biara nni akyi.
I never knew it was that big.	Na minnim da sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse saa.
He performed well on the test.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma yiye wɔ sɔhwɛ no mu.
It’s some of the work, though, so keep at it.	Nanso, ɛyɛ adwuma no bi, enti kɔ so yɛ.
That’s what he would do.	Saa na na ɔbɛyɛ.
I was kind of a party girl for a while.	Ná meyɛ apontow ase abeawa bi bere tiaa bi.
Don’t just do it.	Nyɛ no ara kwa.
Not for us, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn de, ɔkwan biara so.
That’s what you told us.	Ɛno ne nea woka kyerɛɛ yɛn.
That’s all we can do.	Ɛno ara ne nea yebetumi ayɛ.
The man said nothing.	Ɔbarima no anka hwee.
And look what it was like.	Na hwɛ sɛnea na ɛyɛ.
I made a song.	Meyɛɛ dwom bi.
It would be something else.	Ná ɛbɛyɛ biribi foforo.
I have made a mistake.	Mayɛ mfomso.
This old book was rare.	Ná nhoma dedaw yi ho yɛ na.
I’m interested in it.	M’ani gye ho.
Not in a good or bad way.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan pa anaa ɔkwan bɔne so.
Not as good as you think.	Ɛnyɛ papa sɛnea wususuw no.
That may be wrong in your eyes.	Ebia ɛno yɛ mfomso wɔ w’ani so.
For at least a year.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, afe biako mu.
There was nothing going on.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛrekɔ.
Same for your forget, this is just hard.	Saa ara na wo werɛ ho, eyi yɛ den ara kwa.
Not at all by any means.	Ɛnyɛ koraa ɔkwan biara so.
It’s not you either.	Ɛnyɛ wo nso.
So it works from the inside out.	Enti ɛyɛ adwuma fi mu kɔ akyi.
One thing is certain.	Ade biako yɛ nokware.
Help, it seems.	Mmoa, ɛte sɛ nea.
This article is about a variety of things.	Saa asɛm yi fa nneɛma ahorow ho.
They don’t always care.	Ɛho nhia wɔn bere nyinaa.
I understand that this method is time consuming.	Mete ase sɛ saa kwan yi gye bere pii.
Not immediately.	Ɛnyɛ ntɛm ara.
Fresh from a morning nap.	Ɔyɛ foforo afi anɔpa nna mu.
However, there is a flaw.	Nanso, mfomso bi wɔ hɔ.
The bed was a little hard and not very comfortable.	Ná mpa no yɛ den kakra na na ɛnyɛ fɛ koraa.
Everyone liked him.	Ná obiara ani gye ne ho.
I’m not sure.	M’ani nnye ho.
Almost no one can do that.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara ntumi nyɛ saa.
So, it’s possible.	Enti, ɛyɛ yiye.
Nothing much else down here now.	Biribiara nni hɔ pii bio wɔ ha ase mprempren.
It just wasn’t enough.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso ara kwa.
And so it was with the snow.	Na saa ara na na ɛte.
His door remained closed.	Ne pon no kɔɔ so too mu.
I don’t want to hear it.	Mempɛ sɛ mete.
Neither of them should win.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔn mu biara di nkonim.
Not this in a window.	Ɛnyɛ eyi wɔ mfɛnsere mu.
But he knew he was.	Nanso na onim sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
May be added as needed.	Ebia wɔde bɛka ho sɛnea ɛho hia.
Apparently he was just sitting there.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔte hɔ ara kwa.
I have done him a great wrong.	Mayɛ no bɔne kɛse bi.
Start talking to them.	Fi ase ne wɔn kasa.
The water levels seemed high.	Ɛte sɛ nea na nsu no dodow yɛ kɛse.
The man was wearing an old suit.	Ná ɔbarima no hyɛ atade dedaw bi.
He was too young for her.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra dodo ma no.
The same is true.	Saa ara na ɛte.
But at least he knows the problem.	Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no, onim ɔhaw no.
I found the house quickly.	Mihuu ofie no ntɛmntɛm.
He is only a human being.	Ɔyɛ onipa nkutoo.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani agye ho ankasa.
The problem lay elsewhere.	Ná ɔhaw no da baabi foforo.
Money is not a language.	Sika nyɛ kasa.
Maybe he would tell his dad or friends.	Ebia na ɔbɛka akyerɛ ne papa anaa ne nnamfo.
For the most part, it was an eventless week.	Wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu no, na ɛyɛ dapɛn a nsɛm biara nni mu.
I don’t like any part of it.	M’ani nnye ne fã biara ho.
He had offered help even if it was needed.	Ná ɔde mmoa ama sɛ ɛho hia mpo a.
He knew how to do it.	Ná onim sɛnea wɔyɛ.
I didn’t know there was such a thing.	Ná minnim sɛ biribi a ɛte saa wɔ hɔ.
You never know when your last moment will be.	Wunnim bere a wo bere a etwa to no bɛba da.
We should have used two.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde abien di dwuma.
I love this thing.	M’ani gye saa ade yi ho.
If the head moves quickly.	Sɛ ti no tu ntɛmntɛm a.
Look at this.	Hwɛ eyi.
They didn’t seem to care.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm.
Every day is a day.	Da biara da da.
Like in the movies.	Te sɛ sini mu.
He would be doing a lot of things today.	Anka ɔreyɛ nneɛma pii nnɛ.
There is no fresh water here.	Nsu pa biara nni ha.
The existence of life in all its manifestations.	Nkwa a ɛwɔ hɔ wɔ nea ɛda adi nyinaa mu.
I see this all the time.	Mihu eyi bere nyinaa.
The same is true today.	Saa ara na ɛte nnɛ.
The bullet hit him under his arm.	Tuo no bɔɔ ne nsa ase.
I know it’s not me.	Minim sɛ ɛnyɛ me.
A man and his wife lived in the house.	Ná ɔbarima bi ne ne yere te fie hɔ.
No doubt he knew that was not true.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na onim sɛ ɛno nyɛ nokware.
Something that people do.	Biribi a nnipa yɛ.
Where he planned to go.	Baabi a ɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ ɔbɛkɔ.
But they a.	Nanso wɔn a.
The new method will strengthen your power.	Ɔkwan foforo no bɛma wo tumi ayɛ den.
You could have done more.	Anka wubetumi ayɛ pii.
We can’t get out of there.	Yɛrentumi mfi hɔ.
No one says anything.	Obiara nka asɛm biara.
It doesn’t surprise him.	Ɛnyɛ no nwonwa.
But say or do nothing.	Nanso nka anaa nyɛ hwee.
They just do the thing.	Wɔyɛ ade no ara kwa.
Both made a lot of money.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa nyaa sika pii.
I like .	Mepɛ wo .
More importantly.	Nea ɛho hia kɛse no.
That other side of me.	Saa me fã foforo no.
I’m interested in it.	M’ani gye ho.
That’s why he does this.	Ɛno nti na ɔyɛ eyi no.
So that was me.	Enti na ɛno ne me.
He didn't know what to do.	Ná onnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I know them too well.	Minim wɔn yiye dodo.
It just always seems to hurt.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ no yaw bere nyinaa ara kwa.
But it is very difficult for me.	Nanso ɛyɛ den ma me paa.
My hand stays in his hair.	Me nsa tra ne ti nhwi mu.
We can have some fun.	Yebetumi agye yɛn ani kakra.
The language used.	Kasa a wɔde di dwuma no.
Or at least it should be.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
Everyone has a role to play.	Obiara wɔ dwuma a odi.
However, I couldn’t do it.	Nanso, na mintumi nyɛ.
The two were close.	Ná wɔn baanu no bɛn wɔn ho.
I was really into it for a while.	Ná mewɔ mu ankasa bere tiaa bi.
That doesn’t matter to us.	Ɛno nyɛ hwee wɔ yɛn fam.
Surely he could take care of himself.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na obetumi ahwɛ ne ho.
I want to know what happened there.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea esii wɔ hɔ.
It seemed strange.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Review!.	Hwɛ mu!.
People are on the ground.	Nnipa wɔ fam.
But he was a good dog.	Nanso na ɔyɛ ɔkraman pa.
There would be more opportunities for them.	Anka hokwan ahorow pii bɛba ama wɔn.
It’s a simple concept.	Ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
This means that.	Eyi kyerɛ sɛ.
There were many things along the way.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ ɔkwan no so.
Where will he go now.	Ɛhe na ɔbɛkɔ mprempren.
Get there as fast as you can.	Fa kɔ hɔ ntɛmntɛm sɛnea wubetumi.
This is what you can do.	Eyi na wubetumi ayɛ.
This process continues through the season.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi kɔ so kosi bere no mu.
How do we know what is true?	Yɛyɛ dɛn hu nea ɛyɛ nokware ankasa?
The scenic part of town is beautiful.	Kurow no fã a ɛyɛ fɛ no yɛ fɛ yiye.
There was no music.	Ná nnwom biara nni ho.
You’ve forgotten something.	Wo werɛ afi biribi.
He just had to make the most of it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde di dwuma yiye ara kwa.
They were very happy.	Ná wɔn ani agye yiye.
Some days are bad.	Nna bi yɛ bɔne.
I have no idea what is going on.	Minnim nea ɛrekɔ so no ho adwene biara.
It gets bigger and bigger.	Ɛyɛ kɛse na ɛyɛ kɛse.
That plan was simple.	Ná saa nhyehyɛe no yɛ mmerɛw.
Only please go.	Nkutoo mesrɛ wo kɔ.
It should be a good day.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ da pa.
There is not much work left at this point.	Adwuma pii nni hɔ a aka wɔ saa bere yi mu.
And he saw her, too.	Na ɔno nso huu no.
One is obviously a really bad job.	Ɛda adi sɛ biako yɛ adwuma bɔne ankasa.
Even people do that.	Nkurɔfo mpo yɛ saa.
Other than that, the story ended great.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, asɛm no baa awiei kɛse.
In his words.	Wɔ ne nsɛm mu.
However, this does not go the other way.	Nanso, eyi nkɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
Sorry I can't help anymore.	Pa kyɛw me ntumi mmoa bio.
One thing was certain.	Ná ade biako yɛ nokware.
You're not really bad at this.	Wonyɛ bɔne ankasa wɔ eyi mu.
It was a busy morning.	Ná ɛyɛ anɔpa a adagyew nnim.
In this short period of time.	Wɔ saa bere tiaa yi mu.
Hardly surprising.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ nwonwa.
There seemed to be some pleasantness missing from his nature.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea nneɛma bi a ɛyɛ anigye nni ne su mu.
They were indeed beautiful.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ fɛ ampa.
Many people have severe pain in the evening.	Nnipa pii yaw kɛse anwummere.
Their pain is your pain.	Wɔn yaw ne wo yaw.
It’s never easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw da.
Prices have fallen dramatically.	Nneɛma bo akɔ fam kɛse.
I see everything that happened.	Mihu biribiara a esii.
But he had many friends.	Nanso na ɔwɔ nnamfo pii.
He would say he would be hot.	Ná ɔbɛka sɛ ne ho bɛyɛ hyew.
I enjoy his presence every day.	M’ani gye ne ba a ɔwɔ hɔ no ho da biara da.
Everything he had given her was still in his plan.	Biribiara a na ɔde ama no no da so ara wɔ ne nhyehyɛe no mu.
You didn’t know anyone here.	Na wunnim obiara wɔ ha.
But it was highly unlikely.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye koraa.
That is not true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware.
However, this view does not necessarily make things easier.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea saa adwene yi ma nneɛma yɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
So that’s what this is.	Enti ɛno ne eyi.
He is obviously not a man.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔnyɛ ɔbarima.
I think we were the better team.	Misusuw sɛ na yɛyɛ kuw a eye sen biara.
A man who must.	Ɔbarima a ɛsɛ sɛ.
Do the same old things.	Yɛ nneɛma dedaw koro no ara.
It seemed almost too good to be true.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛte sɛ nea eye dodo sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nokware.
But it’s not an idea or anything like that.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwene anaa biribi a ɛte saa.
Why does the mind always want more.	Dɛn nti na adwene no pɛ pii bere nyinaa.
Now it’s complicated.	Seesei ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
There is often a desire to cause trouble.	Mpɛn pii no, ɔpɛ a obi wɔ sɛ ɔde ɔhaw bɛba no wɔ hɔ.
But be careful.	Nanso hwɛ yiye.
I can’t control any of that.	Mintumi nni saa nneɛma no mu biara so.
The city was full of life.	Ná nkwa ahyɛ kurow no mu ma.
It feels the same to me.	Ɛte nka sɛnea ɛte wɔ me ho no.
You’ll be surprised.	Ɛbɛyɛ wo nwonwa.
I want to know what happened next.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea esii wɔ ɛno akyi.
A little bit more.	Kakraa bi ka ho.
A united front.	Anim a ɛyɛ biako.
If you have the time.	Sɛ wowɔ bere a.
I want to be hands on.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nsa wɔ so.
I don’t really know him.	Minnim no ankasa.
For each group.	Wɔ kuw biara ho.
You have to say something interesting about the film.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka biribi a ɛyɛ anigye fa sini no ho.
But he's very nice, his stuff is very nice.	Nanso ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye, ne nneɛma yɛ fɛ yiye.
The moon should be full tonight.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔsram no yɛ ma anadwo yi.
It’s a very old driveway.	Ɛyɛ kar kwan a akyɛ yiye.
He did, of course.	Ɔyɛɛ saa, ampa.
Hopefully we can continue to do so.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ yebetumi akɔ so ayɛ saa.
I just didn’t know what to do with it.	Na minnim nea mede bɛyɛ no ara kwa.
There have been a couple of additions, but only a few.	Wɔde nneɛma abien bi aka ho, nanso kakraa bi pɛ.
He knows me well.	Onim me yiye.
It was really, really hard.	Ná ɛyɛ den ankasa, ankasa.
I think we can have a lot in common.	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi anya nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ pɛ.
Tell us what languages ​​you can help with.	Ka kasa ahorow a wubetumi aboa wɔ ho kyerɛ yɛn.
That’s how they do it.	Saa na wɔyɛ.
He was doing a good job.	Ná ɔreyɛ adwuma yiye.
They all got a chance for him.	Wɔn nyinaa nyaa kwan maa no.
However, the sooner the better.	Nanso, dodow a ɛyɛ ntɛm no, dodow no ara na eye.
But you have to do your part.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wo fam de.
The police car was missing.	Ná polisifo kar no nni hɔ.
That turned me on more.	Ɛno maa me ho yɛɛ me hyew kɛse.
That was the way it was.	Saa na na ɛte.
It wasn’t really thinking about them now.	Na ɛnyɛ wɔn ho adwene ankasa mprempren.
Sorry but someone needs to tell you.	Pa kyɛw nanso ɛsɛ sɛ obi ka kyerɛ wo.
A great story.	Asɛm kɛse bi.
It’s just the girl.	Ɛyɛ abeawa no nkutoo.
A little bit really.	Kakraa bi ankasa.
You can’t fault his design.	Worentumi nni ne nhyehyɛe no ho mfomso.
Maybe he’s a possibility with her.	Ebia ɔne no yɛ obi a obetumi ayɛ biribiara.
Your hair looks great.	Wo ti nhwi no yɛ fɛ yiye.
I don’t want to know what happened that weekend.	Mempɛ sɛ mihu nea esii saa dapɛn awiei no.
I give it all away.	Mede ne nyinaa ma.
The road is not easy at all.	Ɔkwan no nyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
That’s what happened.	Saa na esii.
Some things just happened.	Nneɛma bi sii ara kwa.
How do you do the same?.	Wobɛyɛ dɛn ayɛ saa ara?.
Like, that’s the way it is.	Te sɛ, saa na ɛte.
One is the concept of truth.	Biako ne nokware ho adwene.
If you have a problem, speak up.	Sɛ wowɔ ɔhaw bi a, kasa.
Most days, the house was empty.	Nna dodow no ara, na obiara nni fie hɔ.
There are many things here.	Nneɛma pii wɔ ha.
Now more than ever.	Mprempren sen bere biara.
A gesture of absolute power.	Tumi a edi mũ ho nsa a wɔde yɛ ade.
Isn’t it beautiful.	So ɛnyɛ fɛ.
There is nothing wrong with police work.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ wɔ polisifo adwuma mu.
So this is a mistake.	Enti eyi yɛ mfomso.
But it was wise.	Nanso na ɛyɛ nea nyansa wom.
I think the idea works.	Misusuw sɛ adwene no yɛ adwuma.
Give me a chance.	Ma me hokwan.
Take your gun away.	Fa wo tuo no kɔ.
But it was absolutely necessary to bring it.	Nanso na ɛho hia koraa sɛ wɔde ba.
It was a popular thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
However, he immediately recovered.	Nanso, ne ho tɔɔ no ntɛm ara.
Their lives are in danger.	Wɔn nkwa da asiane mu.
Testing is over.	Sɔhwɛ aba awiei.
He will do something else at the end of the game.	Ɔbɛyɛ biribi foforo wɔ agoru no awiei.
I really want him to be surprised.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no nwonwa ankasa.
I've taken them home now.	Mede wɔn akɔ fie mprempren.
Most animals hibernate.	Mmoa dodow no ara da awɔw bere mu.
This is our true nature.	Eyi ne yɛn su ankasa.
Hopefully people will enjoy it.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ nkurɔfo ani begye ho.
On most, anyway.	Wɔ dodow no ara so no, sɛnea ɛte biara.
He sinned, not me.	Ɔyɛɛ bɔne, ɛnyɛ me.
I wish it wasn’t so cold.	Me yam a anka ɛnyɛ awɔw saa.
But something strange happened.	Nanso ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii.
The next story was more interesting.	Ná asɛm a edi hɔ no yɛ anigye kɛse.
Maybe better for me in a way.	Ebia eye ma me wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
Most were his wife.	Ná dodow no ara yɛ ne yere.
I couldn’t have a bad idea.	Na mintumi nnya adwene bɔne.
We forgot to do that.	Yɛn werɛ fii sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa.
Or the kids.	Anaasɛ mmofra no.
Good job by the police, but slow.	Adwuma a polisifo yɛ no yiye, nanso ɛyɛ ntɛm.
The plans were not very popular.	Ná nhyehyɛe ahorow no nyɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse.
Run, he told himself.	Tu mmirika, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ.
Things are happening out there.	Nneɛma rekɔ so wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
Doing something is something.	Biribi a wobɛyɛ no yɛ biribi.
It’s a pretty neat story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ fɛ a ɛyɛ fɛ.
He was in the house from earlier.	Ná ɔwɔ fie hɔ fi kan no.
It will be the party of the season.	Ɛbɛyɛ apontow a ɛwɔ bere no mu.
And he says that.	Na ɔka sɛ.
Get me out of myself.	Gye me fi me ho.
I had no idea how to do it today.	Ná minni sɛnea mɛyɛ no nnɛ ho adwene biara.
In the short term.	Wɔ bere tiaa mu no.
They just do things.	Wɔyɛ nneɛma ara kwa.
Or, not connected yet.	Anaasɛ, ɛnyɛ nea wɔde abɔ mu de besi nnɛ.
We do this all the time.	Yɛyɛ eyi bere nyinaa.
Take him here.	Fa no tra ha.
It must have been a short time.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ bere tiaa bi.
The drought finally came to an end.	Awiei koraa no, ɔpɛ no baa awiei.
Even better the next day.	Ɛyɛ papa mpo da a edi hɔ no.
I know them well.	Minim wɔn yiye.
It works well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
Lots of things to think about.	Nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
There is no work.	Adwuma biara nni hɔ.
We drove away.	Yɛde ne kar kɔɔ.
It’s new to them.	Ɛyɛ foforo ma wɔn.
It was a wonderful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Can we do this?.	So yebetumi ayɛ eyi?.
You need to consider dry season.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ɔpɛ bere ho.
The real thing.	Ade ankasa no.
At least empty people.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, nnipa a hwee nni mu.
It was very powerful.	Na ɛwɔ tumi kɛse.
It was one of those years.	Ná ɛyɛ saa mfe no mu biako.
There was a lot of money.	Ná sika pii wɔ hɔ.
For me, it was difficult.	Wɔ me fam no, na ɛyɛ den.
You know why that was.	Wunim nea enti a na ɛte saa.
And in a way, it really is.	Na ɔkwan bi so no, ɛte saa ankasa.
You may not even know it exists.	Ebia wunnim mpo sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
I want to see what people do with this.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea nkurɔfo de eyi yɛ.
This city was once a prosperous city.	Bere bi na saa kurow yi yɛ kurow a edi yiye.
It was difficult for the team.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma kuw no.
You want my help.	Wopɛ me mmoa.
It seemed to be the case.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
Everything was working.	Na biribiara yɛ adwuma.
And, for a time, it was enough.	Na, bere bi no, na ɛdɔɔso.
We use it a lot.	Yɛde di dwuma pii.
Please let me go.	Mesrɛ wo ma me nkɔ.
To make people happy.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ na nkurɔfo anya anigye.
Nobody says anything.	Obiara nka hwee.
He thought he understood that.	Ná osusuw sɛ ɔte saa asɛm no ase.
In any case, that was the case in the past.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na ɛte saa bere bi a atwam.
I would have said it was bad.	Anka mɛka sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne.
That’s my problem.	Ɛno ne me haw.
He will commit to that.	Ɔde ne ho bɛma saa.
I just loved that game.	M’ani gyee saa agoru no ho ara kwa.
I have used this method and it works well.	Mede saa kwan yi adi dwuma na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
Our thoughts are with you.	Yɛn adwene wɔ mo nkyɛn.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It shouldn’t be the case.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
Minimal interventions required.	Nneɛma a wɔde wɔn ho gye mu kakraa bi a ɛho hia.
So much more than that.	Enti pii sen saa.
This is easy when you have good information.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw bere a wowɔ nsɛm pa no.
No one was in the car.	Obiara nni kar no mu.
And he knew it, too.	Na ɔno nso nim.
The other work is done by his children.	Adwuma foforo no, ne mma na wɔyɛ.
I worked well with him.	Me ne no yɛɛ adwuma yiye.
That is certainly wrong.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno yɛ mfomso.
It is the same today.	Ɛte saa nnɛ.
Twice as much as it is.	Mpɛn abien sɛnea ɛte no.
This is a difficult task.	Eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den.
This story is now over.	Saa asɛm yi aba awiei mprempren.
So, we are very happy.	Enti, yɛn ani agye yiye.
He had a very good shot from the point.	Na ɔwɔ tuo a eye paa fi asɛm no so.
Some information seems to indicate that.	Ɛte sɛ nea nsɛm bi kyerɛ saa.
And so are your children.	Na saa ara na wo mma nso te.
He seemed to be a different person now.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ onipa foforo mprempren.
He looked like he had.	Ná ɔte sɛ nea na ɔwɔ.
Not in words.	Ɛnyɛ nsɛm mu.
He just bites them, almost.	Ɔka wɔn kɛkɛ, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ.
You know what you have to do.	Wunim nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I could have touched it.	Anka metumi de me nsa aka ho.
This dog loves to play.	Saa ɔkraman yi ani gye agoru ho.
You are in your house now.	Wowɔ wo fie mprempren.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɛyɛ bere ho asɛm ara kwa.
I have a better idea.	Mewɔ adwene a eye sen saa.
The dinner began.	Anwummere aduan no fii ase.
Perhaps he has done so.	Ebia na wayɛ saa.
So it was just really hard.	Enti na ɛyɛ den ankasa ara kwa.
I just want you to discuss this with me.	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me susuw eyi ho ara kwa.
You have a tendency to do that.	Wowɔ su bi sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
That was pretty cool.	Ná ɛno yɛ fɛ yiye.
No drawing is required.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ mfonini biara.
This brings up an interesting idea.	Eyi de adwene bi a ɛyɛ anigye ba.
I love the idea.	M’ani gye adwene no ho.
Full-size photograph.	Mfonini a ne kɛse yɛ pɛ.
For me, this is the only thing that works.	Wɔ me fam no, eyi nkutoo ne ade a ɛyɛ adwuma.
This is what has been going on for years.	Eyi ne nea akɔ so mfe pii ni.
The whole size of the city is.	Kurow no nyinaa kɛse yɛ.
You know what he looks like.	Wunim sɛnea ɔte.
Or whether any of them do.	Anaasɛ sɛ ebia wɔn mu biara yɛ saa a.
It seemed too good to be true.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eye dodo sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nokware.
Even if you might be good, you might be bad.	Sɛ ebia woyɛ papa mpo a, ebia woyɛ bɔne.
I really enjoyed this one.	M’ani gyee eyi ho ankasa.
I was nothing and had nothing.	Ná menyɛ hwee na na minni hwee.
And, in the end, it might have been for the best.	Na, awiei koraa no, ebia na ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
But for the most part he was a nice kid.	Nanso fã kɛse no ara no na ɔyɛ abofra a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
The accident happened in a crowded area.	Akwanhyia no sii wɔ baabi a nnipa ahyɛ hɔ ma.
I don’t want to do it here.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ wɔ ha.
The ‘time’ is very important.	‘Bere’ no ho hia yiye.
He must have given it to the police.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔno na ɔde maa polisifo.
I needed to see you.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu wo.
He always puts her down.	Ɔde no to fam bere nyinaa.
They make a statement for hibernation.	Wɔyɛ asɛm bi ma awɔw bere mu nna.
It’s a state of mind.	Ɛyɛ adwene tebea.
He wasn’t interested.	Ná n’ani nnye ho.
A lot can happen in a year.	Pii betumi asi wɔ afe biako mu.
There was no reason for it.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Further study is needed.	Adesua foforo ho hia.
Not a single time.	Ɛnyɛ bere biako mpo.
Like.	Te sɛ.
How long this takes.	Bere tenten a eyi gye.
But nothing is done.	Nanso biribiara nyɛ.
It’s not just one thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade biako pɛ.
It seemed strange.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He always uses available resources.	Ɔde nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ di dwuma bere nyinaa.
Mine isn’t the same.	Me de no nyɛ saa.
But is his time over?.	Nanso so ne bere aba awiei?.
However, we can do more.	Nanso, yebetumi ayɛ pii.
Just happy, happy, happy.	Anigye, anigye, anigye ara kwa.
For me, it was exciting.	Wɔ me fam no, na ɛyɛ anigye.
But they had to do it.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He has to live with his mother.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne ne maame tra.
Just get out of here.	Fi ha kɛkɛ.
I do something completely different.	Meyɛ biribi foforo koraa.
This view has received some support.	Saa adwene yi anya mmoa bi.
Always close the door.	To ɔpon no mu bere nyinaa.
The animals looked at him.	Mmoa no hwɛɛ no.
Only the most important ones.	Nea ɛho hia sen biara nkutoo.
He loved to use it and was good at it.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔde bedi dwuma na na ne ho akokwaw wɔ mu.
But not like anyone else.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛ obi foforo biara.
It’s not like here.	Ɛnyɛ te sɛ ha.
There was definitely something going on out there.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na biribi rekɔ so wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
The same is obviously true of animals.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛte saa ara wɔ mmoa ho.
After all that time, he just shrugged.	Saa bere no nyinaa akyi no, ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ mu kɛkɛ.
It should have been.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
The dog doesn’t care.	Ɔkraman no mfa ne ho.
You don’t know either, at least not.	Wo nso wunnim, anyɛ yiye koraa no, wunnim.
Nothing is that simple.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
I can barely do anything.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nyɛ hwee.
So the statement is true.	Enti asɛm a wɔka no yɛ nokware.
But someone put it here for a reason.	Nanso biribi nti na obi de too ha.
You know, which is okay.	Wunim, a ɛnyɛ hwee.
To put one foot in front of the other.	Sɛ wode nan biako besi biako anim.
I did it to the best of my ability.	Meyɛɛ no ​​sɛnea metumi biara.
Give him half a chance and he will do the rest.	Ma no kwan fã na ɔno na ɔbɛyɛ nea aka no.
But, I will go into it with you.	Nanso, me ne wo bɛkɔ mu.
There were three important points.	Ná nsɛm abiɛsa a ɛho hia wɔ hɔ.
The incident happened last year.	Asɛm no sii afe a etwaam no.
A smart job.	Adwuma a nyansa wom.
Each of you.	Mo mu biara.
I have done this to this day.	Mayɛ eyi de besi nnɛ.
Obviously, but there’s a big one.	Ɛda adi sɛ, nanso kɛse bi wɔ hɔ.
But get to the point.	Nanso kɔ asɛm no so.
I had done it right.	Ná mayɛ no yiye.
I want to be me.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ me.
I have known him well over the years.	Minim no yiye wɔ mfe pii a atwam no mu.
He did so knowing that regardless.	Ɔyɛɛ saa a na onim saa no mfa ho.
You forget about yourself.	Wo werɛ fi wo ho.
Full-size photograph.	Mfonini a ne kɛse yɛ pɛ.
Always do one thing.	Yɛ ade biako bere nyinaa.
I'll give it to you.	Mede ma wo.
So take it out of there.	Enti fa fi hɔ.
We put it there.	Yɛde to hɔ.
Right now is not the time.	Mprempren yi ara nyɛ bere no.
Your father asked you.	Wo papa bisaa wo sɛ.
However, in my case, my mom told people right away.	Nanso, wɔ me tebea no mu no, me maame ka kyerɛɛ nkurɔfo ntɛm ara.
One great job.	Adwuma kɛse biako.
It was actually kind of weird.	Na ɛyɛ nwonwa bi ankasa.
He must first get to know her well.	Ɛsɛ sɛ odi kan hu no yiye.
This is what you can expect.	Eyi ne nea wubetumi ahwɛ kwan.
The risks are always there.	Asiane ahorow no wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
The old house fell down a few years ago.	Ofie dedaw no hwee ase mfe kakraa bi a atwam ni.
Much better than before.	Pii yiye sen kan no.
It doesn’t really hurt.	Ɛnyɛ yaw ankasa.
She has lived alone ever since.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔte hɔ fi saa bere no.
It had many windows.	Ná ɛwɔ mfɛnsere pii.
I love that some mornings.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho anɔpa bi.
Or he doesn’t do the same to them.	Anaasɛ ɔno nso nyɛ wɔn saa ara.
I thought you knew that too.	Misusuwii sɛ wo nso wunim saa.
Her children never came home.	Ná ne mma mma fie da.
The rest is here.	Nea aka no wɔ ha.
We need to head to them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde yɛn ti kɔ wɔn nkyɛn.
A pleasant evening.	Anwummere a ɛyɛ anigye.
Just not anymore.	Kɛkɛ a ɛnyɛ bio.
My father was there too.	Ná me papa nso wɔ hɔ.
But it’s dangerous.	Nanso ɛyɛ asiane.
Telling him all you told me.	Nea woka kyerɛɛ me nyinaa a wobɛka akyerɛ no.
The way you do it.	Sɛnea woyɛ no.
It is very important.	Ɛho hia kɛse.
If nothing else .	Sɛ biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a .
It will surprise you.	Ɛbɛyɛ wo nwonwa.
I was too short.	Ná meyɛ tiaa dodo.
As if there was something here.	Te sɛ nea biribi wɔ ha.
He was almost one of them now.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɔyɛ wɔn mu biako mprempren.
I would like some information, please.	Mepɛ nsɛm bi, mesrɛ wo.
This is very important to me.	Eyi ho hia me kɛse.
The former is far easier than the latter.	Kan no yɛ mmerɛw koraa sen nea etwa to no.
This is on him.	Eyi wɔ ne so.
Why not now?.	Dɛn nti na ɛnte saa mprempren?.
But that should not be used.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde saa asɛm no di dwuma.
Take their lunch.	Fa wɔn awia aduan.
There is little water.	Nsu kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
It was a huge mistake.	Na ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
This simply cannot be true.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ nokware kɛkɛ.
I touched his hand.	Mede me nsa kaa ne nsa.
However, there is still much work to be done.	Nanso, adwuma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
That’s it, more or less.	Ɛno ne no, pii anaa kakraa bi.
I'm a good boy.	Meyɛ abarimaa pa.
That meeting is usually in the evening.	Saa nhyiam no taa yɛ anwummere.
This has been a pretty big day.	Eyi ayɛ da kɛse bi a ɛyɛ fɛ.
New cars cost a lot of money.	Kar foforo gye sika pii.
I love old books.	M’ani gye nhoma dedaw ho.
He drove to his mother’s house just in case.	Ɔde kar kɔɔ ne maame fie sɛ ebia biribi bɛba a.
The meal went well.	Aduan no kɔɔ so yiye.
The year is going fast.	Afe no rekɔ so ntɛmntɛm.
Such a system is impossible.	Nhyehyɛe a ɛte saa no ntumi nyɛ yiye.
But this was not the case	Nanso na eyi nte saa .
Or it certainly seems that way.	Anaasɛ akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
He touched my hand.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa me nsa.
So resources should be used efficiently.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma no di dwuma yiye.
And nothing is free.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ kwa.
We were relieved.	Yɛn ho tɔɔ yɛn.
He would come by bus the next day.	Ná ɔde bɔs bɛba da a edi hɔ no.
This is a mistake.	Eyi yɛ mfomso.
There was always variety here.	Ná nneɛma ahorow ahorow wɔ ha bere nyinaa.
I don’t know where it is.	Minnim baabi a ɛwɔ.
Take a closer look.	Hwɛ no yiye.
This gives you a first.	Eyi ma wo kan.
He had one shirt and one pair of shorts.	Ná ɔwɔ atade biako ne atade tiaa biako.
Or my mother.	Anaasɛ me maame.
None of us know what you do anymore.	Yɛn mu biara nnim nea woyɛ bio.
They both occupy the space under the bed.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa gye baabi a ɛwɔ mpa no ase no.
He brought you home, all in one.	Ɔde wo baa fie, ne nyinaa yɛ biako.
He has been working on this issue for years.	Wayɛ saa asɛm yi ho adwuma mfe pii ni.
I know he can handle it when things get tough.	Minim sɛ obetumi adi ho dwuma bere a nneɛma mu ayɛ den no.
I see the problem.	Mihu ɔhaw no.
I’m not feeling well.	Me ho nyɛ me den.
It’s the mental image you have of yourself.	Ɛyɛ adwene mu mfonini a wowɔ wɔ wo ho.
No good, perhaps.	Pa biara nni hɔ, ebia.
I have made a few meals.	Mayɛ aduan kakraa bi.
So, in other words,	Enti, ɔkwan foforo so no, .
And that was the case in this case.	Na ɛte saa wɔ asɛm yi mu.
You are the problem here.	Wo ne ɔhaw no wɔ ha.
He ran as fast as he could.	Ɔde mmirika bɔɔ mmirika ntɛmntɛm sɛnea obetumi biara.
But there is no timeline.	Nanso bere nhyehyɛe biara nni hɔ.
Accept the room just as it is.	Gye dan no tom sɛnea ɛte no ara pɛ.
The whole time.	Bere no nyinaa.
But I was alone.	Nanso na me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ.
That’s how people talk back then.	Saa na nkurɔfo kasa saa bere no.
There is no problem.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
But it’s a very important one.	Nanso ɛyɛ nea ɛho hia paa.
Most likely three.	Ɛda adi kɛse sɛ abiɛsa.
I just wanted it all to be over.	Ná mepɛ sɛ ne nyinaa ba awiei ara kwa.
It must be that time of year again.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa bere no wɔ afe no mu bio.
That was his only hope.	Ná ɛno nkutoo ne anidaso a ɔwɔ.
For the background.	Wɔ akyi no ho.
He was also great.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse nso.
He never had a job.	Ná onni adwuma da.
I know people he knows.	Minim nnipa a onim wɔn.
I only hope that one day I will be that good.	Nea mewɔ anidaso ara ne sɛ da bi mɛyɛ papa saa.
I thought it might be.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
He says that even he is.	Ɔka sɛ ɔno mpo te saa.
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Unless it’s some truth.	Gye sɛ ɛyɛ nokware bi.
That much is true.	Saa dodow no ara yɛ nokware.
So do you, too.	Saa ara na wo nso.
Things are not always what they seem.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na nneɛma te sɛ nea ɛte.
I have to do this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi.
After that, stay with me.	Ɛno akyi no, tra me nkyɛn.
But this time around.	Nanso saa bere yi de.
Some of the work is still needed.	Adwuma a wɔyɛ no bi da so ara ho hia.
There are some really amazing stories here.	Nsɛm bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa wɔ ha.
It’s just for me.	Ɛyɛ me nkutoo de.
What did you use for the test?	Dɛn na wode yɛɛ sɔhwɛ no?
He looked down at his hand.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ fam hwɛɛ ne nsa no.
No one can doubt this.	Obiara ntumi nnye eyi ho kyim.
And it seemed to be.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
And his hair, too.	Na ne ti nhwi nso.
Inserted information	Nsɛm a wɔde ahyɛ mu
It will be just for the two of us.	Ɛbɛyɛ ama yɛn baanu no nkutoo.
We have a lot of books at home.	Yɛwɔ nhoma pii wɔ fie.
The party went on all night.	Apontow no kɔɔ so anadwo mũ no nyinaa.
So it’s a little weird.	Enti ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra.
We like it here a lot.	Yɛn ani gye ho wɔ ha yiye.
That sounds perfect to me.	Ɛno te sɛ nea edi mu ma me.
I can play this game over and over again.	Metumi adi saa agoru yi mpɛn pii.
This is important.	Eyi ho hia.
Tell me why you want to do that.	Ka nea enti a wopɛ sɛ woyɛ saa kyerɛ me.
You can see why.	Wubetumi ahu nea enti a ɛte saa.
Inside was an old gun.	Ná tuo dedaw bi wɔ mu.
Give the animals water.	Fa nsu ma mmoa no.
You will only get this game for so long.	Wo nsa bɛka saa agoru yi bere tenten saa nkutoo.
Or even consider them.	Anaasɛ mpo susuw wɔn ho.
This is obviously not working.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nyɛ adwuma.
He was worried about you.	Ná wo ho asɛm haw no.
It’s not that good.	Ɛnyɛ papa saa.
For information, go here.	Sɛ wopɛ nsɛm a, kɔ ha.
Faster, and more.	Ntɛmntɛm, ne pii.
That is nothing new.	Ɛno nyɛ asɛm foforo.
He was pretty good that way.	Ná ɔyɛ papa yiye saa kwan no so.
I have to do something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi.
You’ve grown up.	Woayɛ kɛse.
It was a wonderful day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye.
I don’t have children.	Minni mma.
She is the other girl.	Ɔno ne abeawa foforo no.
That is the situation here.	Saa na tebea no te wɔ ha.
He put them down.	Ɔde wɔn too hɔ.
Thank you, man.	Meda wo ase, ɔbarima.
Problems with sleep.	Ɔhaw a ɛwɔ nna mu.
I knew that part too.	Ná minim saa fã no nso.
Make yourself at home.	Yɛ wo ho sɛ wowɔ fie.
So we had a way.	Enti na yɛwɔ kwan.
It's almost there now.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ mprempren.
But he doesn’t even know that.	Nanso onnim saa asɛm no mpo.
I don't know that so well.	Minnim saa asɛm no yiye saa.
He wasn’t in it.	Ná onni mu.
No mistake, kid.	Mfomso biara nni ho, abofra.
There was nothing to do.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
But here I am.	Nanso ha na mewɔ.
He was at home.	Ná ɔwɔ fie.
They have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Everything is so simple.	Biribiara yɛ mmerɛw saa.
And this brings us to the unhappy ending.	Na eyi de yɛn ba awiei a ɛnyɛ anigye no so.
In the end, no one is playing.	Awiei koraa no, obiara nni agoru.
Everyone is there to eat.	Obiara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ odi.
For you.	Ma wo.
It doesn’t hurt anymore.	Ɛnyɛ yaw bio.
But it should be fine in most cases.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ papa wɔ nsɛm dodow no ara mu.
That's the only one that works so far.	Ɛno nkutoo ne nea ɛyɛ adwuma de besi nnɛ.
There was absolutely no issue.	Ná asɛm biara nni hɔ koraa.
He was very excited about it.	Ná n’ani agye ho kɛse.
It seemed like a great job.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
Think of this recipe as a complete shoe.	Susuw saa aduan yi ho sɛ mpaboa a edi mũ.
Moreover, it is very wise.	Bio nso, nyansa wom yiye.
He's doing well.	Ɔreyɛ yiye.
Police believe the incident was random.	Polisifo gye di sɛ asɛm no sii kwa.
They are what they are.	Wɔyɛ nea wɔyɛ.
It was another terrible week of school.	Ná ɛyɛ dapɛn foforo a ɛyɛ hu wɔ sukuu mu.
I just need someone here for me.	Me hia obi wɔ ha ma me ara kwa.
He slipped his hand into mine.	Ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ me de no mu.
In the case of the.	Wɔ asɛm no mu.
Look at that story.	Hwɛ saa asɛm no.
The reason is price.	Nea enti a ɛte saa ne bo.
Things you would add, if you could.	Nneɛma a anka wode bɛka ho, sɛ wubetumi a.
That’s an idea.	Ɛno yɛ adwene bi.
It’s a great system, it works.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe kɛse, ɛyɛ adwuma.
I want to know.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu.
You have done quite well.	Woayɛ no yiye koraa.
So it seems to be.	Enti ɛte sɛ nea ɛte.
It’s not a lie.	Ɛnyɛ atoro.
It’s the most awesome people, the best people.	Ɛyɛ nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ hu sen biara, nnipa a wɔyɛ papa sen biara.
I just wanted to be in the movie.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mewɔ sini no mu ara kwa.
I can’t think of one bad thing.	Mintumi nsusuw ade bɔne biako ho.
There was no one to help him.	Ná obiara nni hɔ a ɔbɛboa no.
But on me it just doesn’t work.	Nanso me so no ɛnyɛ adwuma kɛkɛ.
And it really works.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma ankasa.
I am at home now.	Mewɔ fie seesei.
Or there is another easier way.	Anaasɛ ɔkwan foforo bi wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
This is what is happening.	Eyi ne nea ɛrekɔ so.
But it’s not really true.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa.
He and his father, say.	Ɔne ne papa, ka sɛ.
It’s not about money.	Ɛnyɛ sika ho asɛm.
I am not as busy as I used to be.	Minni adagyew te sɛ kan no.
Not that any of this matters to the man.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ eyi mu biara ho hia ɔbarima no.
You have great power.	Wowɔ tumi kɛse.
He was a great guy.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse.
The phone was already ringing.	Ná telefon no rebɔ dedaw.
He is a great monster.	Ɔyɛ aboa kɛse.
It’s too hot here!	Ɛyɛ hyew dodo wɔ ha!
It’s under the table, at my feet.	Ɛwɔ pon no ase, wɔ me nan ho.
Stories filled with money.	Nsɛm a sika ahyɛ mu ma.
Three animals were used in each group.	Wɔde mmoa abiɛsa dii dwuma wɔ kuw biara mu.
But it would have been anyway.	Nanso anka ɛbɛyɛ sɛnea ɛte biara.
Rumor has it that they serve very good food there.	Asɛm bi ka sɛ wɔde aduan pa paa ma wɔ hɔ.
Time will pass.	Bere bɛkɔ so.
It works for me.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ma me.
I don’t think about it that way.	Minsusuw ho saa.
He was sitting in his car.	Ná ɔte ne kar mu.
We can be quick.	Yebetumi ayɛ ntɛm.
It will be another element of the film.	Ɛbɛyɛ ade foforo a wɔde yɛ sini no.
It doesn’t seem to be.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ saa.
He thought he understood everything.	Ná osusuw sɛ ɔte biribiara ase.
But no one cared then.	Nanso na obiara mfa ne ho saa bere no.
A plumber did what was necessary.	Obi a ɔyɛ nsu ho adwuma yɛɛ nea ɛho hia.
This is truly remarkable.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
It seems a little complicated.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den kakra.
All, with one exception.	Ne nyinaa, gye biako a ɛte saa.
It shouldn’t be necessary to spend money often.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛho hia sɛ wɔde sika di dwuma mpɛn pii.
I had a guy and he was a good guy.	Na mewɔ ɔbarima bi na na ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa.
What there is is language, and lots of it.	Nea ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ kasa, na ɛdɔɔso.
We can make sure the bed will be comfortable.	Yebetumi ahwɛ ahu sɛ mpa no bɛyɛ fɛ.
Not one as terrible as mine.	Ɛnyɛ biako a ne ho yɛ hu te sɛ me de no.
The same thought went through my head again and again.	Adwene koro no ara faa me ti so mpɛn pii.
Mary needs new clothes.	Mary hia ntade foforo.
I can handle this.	Metumi adi eyi ho dwuma.
Not this time around.	Ɛnyɛ saa bere yi.
Music.	Nnwom.
I couldn’t believe my eyes.	Ná mintumi nnye m’ani nni.
The people you know are smart.	Nnipa a wunim wɔn no wɔ nyansa.
I can never come to you again.	Mintumi mma wo nkyɛn bio da.
Did you have enough food today?	So na wowɔ aduan a ɛdɔɔso nnɛ?
There was a time when he would have said what he thought.	Bere bi wɔ hɔ a anka ɔbɛka nea osusuw ho.
They are the precursors to learning.	Wɔn ne nneɛma a edi adesua anim.
But it had happened.	Nanso na aba.
Your father will do whatever he wants.	Wo papa bɛyɛ nea ɔpɛ biara.
That went well.	Ɛno kɔɔ so yiye.
And this usually works well enough.	Na eyi taa yɛ adwuma yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Look me in the eye.	Hwɛ me wɔ m’ani so.
People need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo hu.
You can only park here for two hours.	Wubetumi de kar asi ha nnɔnhwerew abien pɛ.
The important test had come.	Ná sɔhwɛ a ɛho hia no aba.
And it shouldn’t be.	Na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
Last year there was a terrible drought.	Afe a etwaam no, ɔpɛ a ɛyɛ hu sii.
I thought maybe you could do something with it.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia wubetumi de ayɛ biribi.
I see that he did.	Mihu sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
Trust me, that was no accident.	Gye me di, na ɛno nyɛ akwanhyia.
I didn’t know what to do or what to do next.	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ anaa nea edi hɔ no.
Anything you can give.	Biribiara a wubetumi de ama.
There is a very good job for us.	Adwuma pa bi wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye ma yɛn.
They are very interesting.	Wɔn ani gye wɔn ho yiye.
However, many were just as good.	Nanso, saa ara na na pii yɛ papa.
Both return an object.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa san de ade bi ba.
Mom was never very far away.	Ná Maame nkɔ akyiri kɛse da.
You are in a very dangerous situation where you are.	Wowɔ tebea a asiane wom yiye mu wɔ baabi a wowɔ no.
Assume again that is true.	Fa no bio sɛ ​​ɛno yɛ nokware.
This was too fast.	Ná eyi yɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
He says he does.	Ɔka sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Try again now, there's a good boy.	Bɔ mmɔden bio mprempren, abarimaa pa bi wɔ hɔ.
So, in the end.	Enti, awiei koraa no.
You never know what each month will bring.	Wunnim nea ɔsram biara de bɛba da.
And without a doubt, that time would be now.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, na saa bere no bɛyɛ mprempren.
It is very similar to the use.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔde di dwuma no ara pɛ.
However, more needs to be done.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ pii.
That we can be friends.	Sɛ yebetumi ayɛ nnamfo.
Look, years can pass.	Hwɛ, mfe betumi atwam.
Word is indeed important.	Asɛm ho hia ampa.
He was the only person there.	Ná ɔno nkutoo ne onipa a ɔwɔ hɔ.
First thing tomorrow.	Ade a edi kan ɔkyena.
Everyone seems to have someone.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara wɔ obi.
It might be later today.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ akyiri yi nnɛ.
Back home, the shot is done.	San kɔ fie, tuo no yɛ.
Still, they seemed happy and content.	Nanso, na ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani agye na wɔn ani agye.
Shorter days, less work.	Nna tiaa, adwuma kakraa bi.
It might be something else.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ biribi foforo.
He will be gone another week.	Ɔbɛkɔ dapɛn foforo.
They do things.	Wɔyɛ nneɛma.
I love the names.	M’ani gye din ahorow no ho.
I'm going to the city.	Mekɔ kurow no mu.
However, water is water.	Nanso, nsu yɛ nsu.
There are many of you.	Mo mu pii wɔ hɔ.
He was a part of everything and with everything.	Na ɔyɛ biribiara fã na biribiara nso ka ne ho.
If you think you will get better, so will you.	Sɛ wususuw sɛ wo ho bɛtɔ wo a, saa ara na wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
He has been here for years.	Ɔde mfe pii aba ha.
It’s a surprise to me.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa.
That leaves no one with time.	Ɛno mma obiara nnya bere.
One can go on and on.	Obi betumi akɔ so.
That’s a long time in the past.	Ɛno yɛ bere tenten wɔ bere a atwam no mu.
It was just a car then, any old car.	Na ɛyɛ kar ara kwa saa bere no, kar dedaw biara.
But be careful.	Nanso hwɛ yiye.
I put everything into it.	Mede biribiara hyɛ mu.
All he knew was that he had to try.	Nea na onim ara ne sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden.
Get back to you.	San kɔ wo nkyɛn.
Maybe you have a chance.	Ebia wowɔ hokwan.
They were wonderful people.	Ná wɔyɛ nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa.
It seemed interesting.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
Two more years.	Mfe abien bio.
He was a handsome man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Use it to free yourself.	Fa di dwuma fa de wo ho.
I do a lot of that these days.	Meyɛ saa nneɛma pii nnansa yi.
It didn’t seem like such a bad idea, anyway.	Na ɛnte sɛ adwene bɔne a ɛte saa, ɔkwan biara so.
He comes to school by bus every day.	Ɔde bɔs ba sukuu da biara.
It’s a good movie.	Ɛyɛ sini pa.
I see it as a home.	Mihu sɛ ɛyɛ ofie.
If someone does, accept it.	Sɛ obi yɛ saa a, gye tom.
That can be difficult and even dangerous.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ den na asiane wom mpo.
Part of the work.	Adwuma no fã bi.
But not while he was working.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bere a na ɔreyɛ adwuma no.
Her son's cries filled the room.	Ne ba no su hyɛɛ dan no mu ma.
But you can help me if you can tell me more.	Nanso wubetumi aboa me sɛ wubetumi aka pii akyerɛ me a.
But there is a place.	Nanso baabi wɔ hɔ.
He had no intention of doing so.	Ná ɔnyɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
Most problems were the same.	Ná ɔhaw dodow no ara yɛ ade koro.
The dog sensed something was wrong.	Ɔkraman no tee nka sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye.
The system has been trending recently.	Nhyehyɛe no ayɛ nea ɛrekɔ so nnansa yi ara.
Let me just do that.	Ma menyɛ saa kɛkɛ.
It was either that or homework.	Na ɛyɛ saa anaasɛ ofie nnwuma.
He obviously has a bit of an edge at this point.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔwɔ anim kakra wɔ saa bere yi mu.
He can do what he wants.	Obetumi ayɛ nea ɔpɛ.
There should be no surprise in this industry.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obi ho dwiriw no wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
You can’t work on it.	Worentumi nyɛ ho adwuma.
I hoped they would like it.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ wɔn ani begye ho.
The situation was controlling.	Ná tebea no di so.
Like a door.	Te sɛ ɔpon bi.
A rare squirrel.	Ɔkraman a ne ho yɛ na.
First, the team was told not to work.	Nea edi kan no, wɔka kyerɛɛ kuw no sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma.
He can be here now.	Obetumi aba ha mprempren.
Her new hairstyle made her look better.	Ne ti nhwi foforo no maa ne ho yɛɛ fɛ.
It is far too late.	Ɛyɛ nea aka akyi dodo koraa.
They do what they do and we do what we do.	Wɔyɛ nea wɔyɛ na yɛn nso yɛyɛ nea yɛyɛ.
On the phone.	Wɔ telefon so.
They have to be somewhere.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ baabi.
The police arrived.	Polisifo no baa hɔ.
I wasn’t looking out.	Ná ɛnyɛ sɛ mehwɛ abɔnten.
As such, our entire business is at risk.	Sɛnea ɛte no, yɛn adwuma no nyinaa da asiane mu.
It was expensive, and the food was not great.	Ná ne bo yɛ den, na na aduan no nyɛ kɛse.
In that car.	Wɔ saa kar no mu.
I put my hand on her.	Mede me nsa too ne so.
It really didn’t go down very well.	Ankasa ankɔ fam yiye koraa.
All right.	Ne nyinaa yɛ.
It’s easier for you.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw ma wo.
He was very excited.	Ná n’ani agye yiye.
Not until he tells her.	Ɛnyɛ kosi sɛ ɔbɛka akyerɛ no.
Only his eyes.	N’ani nkutoo.
Meanwhile, he was the most interesting man she knew.	Saa bere yi nyinaa, na ɔyɛ ɔbarima a n’ani gye ho sen biara a onim no.
Maybe I still do that.	Ebia meda so ara yɛ saa.
Or so that saying goes.	Anaasɛ sɛnea saa asɛm no ka no.
This was new to me.	Ná eyi yɛ ade foforo ma me.
It has been used before.	Wɔde adi dwuma pɛn.
Not so much anymore.	Ɛnyɛ pii saa bio.
He feels the way she feels.	Ɔte sɛnea ɔte nka no nka.
I had never liked him.	Ná m’ani nnye ne ho da.
A big mistake.	Mfomso kɛse.
We used to have one.	Kan no na yɛwɔ bi.
This is his picture.	Eyi ne ne mfonini.
He doesn’t know what he wants to do.	Onnim nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
If you could help me that would be great.	Sɛ wubetumi aboa me a anka ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
This was a job that only he could do.	Ná eyi yɛ adwuma a ɔno nkutoo na obetumi ayɛ.
Just this past weekend.	Dapɛn awiei a atwam yi ara.
The scene was stunning in its haunting beauty	Ná tebea no yɛ nwonwa wɔ ne fɛ a ɛyɛ hu no mu
But wrong in what way?.	Nanso mfomso wɔ ɔkwan bɛn so?.
No starting points available.	Nsɛm a wɔde fi ase biara nni hɔ a ɛwɔ hɔ.
He did a lot of things for me.	Ɔyɛɛ nneɛma pii maa me.
And for the most part, that has been true.	Na fã kɛse no ara no, ɛno ayɛ nokware.
Not so later.	Ɛnyɛ saa akyiri yi.
And that is the case now.	Na ɛte saa mprempren.
That has been this week.	Ɛno ayɛ dapɛn yi.
It’s still too much.	Ɛda so ara yɛ pii dodo.
I missed it every day.	Ná mepa ho kyɛw da biara da.
The city also operates a bus system.	Kurow no nso de bɔs nhyehyɛe bi di dwuma.
It’s given to you.	Wɔde ama wo.
This is the new stuff.	Eyi ne nneɛma foforo no.
Or maybe you don’t take the test at all.	Anaasɛ ebia wonyɛ sɔhwɛ no koraa.
There are really good things but also terrible ones.	Nneɛma pa wɔ hɔ ankasa nanso ɛyɛ hu nso.
He was a very nice man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa paa.
The windows overlooked the city.	Ná mfɛnsere no hwɛ kurow no.
That will be it for us.	Ɛno na ɛbɛyɛ ama yɛn.
That was important.	Ná ɛno ho hia.
It was either us or them.	Ná ɛyɛ yɛn anaa wɔn.
Just what I like at the time.	Nea m’ani gye ho saa bere no ara kwa.
Look and see.	Hwɛ na hwɛ.
Without it, I couldn’t have done anything.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, anka mintumi ntumi nyɛ hwee.
It may be the last.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nea etwa to.
I want him.	Mepɛ no.
I was fascinated by him.	Ná m’ani agye no ho.
Something, at least.	Biribi, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
This is what it looks like.	Eyi ne sɛnea ɛte.
You are too strong, stronger than any of us.	Wo ho yɛ den dodo, wo ho yɛ den sen yɛn mu biara.
Be careful here.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ ha.
Very nice quality.	Su a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Food is more complicated.	Aduan yɛ nea ɛyɛ den kɛse.
Whenever that is.	Bere biara a ɛno yɛ.
So there are lots of parties.	Enti apontow ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
It’s our pleasure.	Ɛyɛ yɛn anigye.
And you don’t do that.	Na wonyɛ saa.
Maybe it will, a little bit.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ, kakra.
That was a big mistake on my part.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfomso kɛse wɔ me fam.
You are not one of us.	Wonyɛ yɛn mu biako.
I should have done more.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ pii.
He kicked it around.	Ɔde ne nan bɔɔ ho.
There’s a dog in my room.	Ɔkraman bi wɔ me dan mu.
There are other reasons for this.	Nneɛma foforo nso wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
His head was down.	Ná ne ti akɔ fam.
Not in a month.	Ɛnyɛ ɔsram biako mu.
And this is important.	Na eyi ho hia.
He was imprisoned.	Wɔde no too afiase.
I can’t understand.	Mintumi nka ase.
He was the one who did it.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ saa.
So sorry, to do this though.	Enti kyɛw, sɛ wobɛyɛ eyi nanso.
None of us needed to say it.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ yɛn mu biara ka.
But there are problems with this idea as well.	Nanso ɔhaw ahorow wɔ saa adwene yi nso ho.
You know exactly how I feel.	Wunim yiye sɛnea mete nka.
Not this time around.	Ɛnyɛ saa bere yi.
We’ve got one foot on it.	Yɛde nan biako ahyɛ so.
He spoke an old language.	Ná ɔka kasa dedaw bi.
My father was a good man.	Ná me papa yɛ onipa pa.
So we have to do the same.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa ara.
You are too beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ dodo.
That had to come from me.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno fi me nkyɛn.
And get rid of it.	Na yi no fi hɔ.
You need to be quick.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ntɛm.
The music is just too loud for my liking.	Nnwom no yɛ den dodo ara kwa sɛ m’ani begye ho.
I feel very happy here.	Mete nka sɛ m’ani agye yiye wɔ ha.
If only you could work less.	Sɛ anka wubetumi ayɛ adwuma kakraa bi a.
He loves me.	Ɔpɛ me.
Get involved with us.	Fa wo ho hyɛ yɛn ho.
He could have been there.	Anka obetumi aba hɔ.
But she feels his eyes on her.	Nanso ɔte nka sɛ n’ani wɔ ne so.
What food, how much food.	Aduan bɛn, aduan dodow ahe.
Time is a prison.	Bere yɛ afiase.
The animals ran out of danger.	Mmoa no de mmirika fii asiane mu.
At least most people do.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, nnipa dodow no ara yɛ saa.
I think he's out there somewhere.	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ abɔnten hɔ baabi.
I have one now too.	Me nso mewɔ bi mprempren.
I still see a lot of that.	Meda so ara hu saa asɛm no pii.
What were you doing?	Dɛn na na woreyɛ?
They are too dangerous.	Asiane wom dodo.
It seems strange.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It’s a little bit.	Ɛyɛ kakra.
That didn’t work either.	Ɛno nso anyɛ adwuma.
It was very powerful.	Ná ɛwɔ tumi kɛse.
But it’s not great.	Nanso ɛnyɛ kɛse.
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
On my friends.	Wɔ me nnamfo so.
I can't go into that.	Mintumi nkɔ saa asɛm no mu.
Look at the and.	Hwɛ na.
Years of on-the-job experience.	Mfe pii a wɔde ayɛ adwuma wɔ adwumam.
He was amazing.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa.
It all has to be done manually.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde nsa yɛ ne nyinaa.
And that’s probably one of our best traits right now.	Na ebia ɛno yɛ yɛn su a eye sen biara mprempren no mu biako.
This will likely continue.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi bɛkɔ so.
I just couldn’t speak.	Na mintumi ankasa kɛkɛ.
None of them in this case.	Wɔn mu biara nni hɔ wɔ asɛm yi mu.
There were so few of us.	Ná yɛyɛ kakraa bi saa.
There is almost nothing left on their list.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biribiara nka wɔn din mu.
He had taken things too far.	Ná ɔde nneɛma akɔ akyiri dodo.
That can’t be necessary.	Ɛno ntumi nhia.
He is working this out for us.	Ɔreyɛ saa asɛm yi ho adwuma ama yɛn.
But it seems to me that you are doing just fine so far.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ me sɛ woreyɛ yiye ara kwa de besi ha.
However, I don’t go far with them.	Nanso, me ne wɔn nkɔ akyiri.
Once my father was gone.	Bere bi na me papa nni hɔ.
That never happened.	Ɛno anyɛ saa da.
But there was nothing.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ.
It will become a habit for them.	Ɛbɛyɛ su ama wɔn.
But maybe it was just the legs of the table.	Nanso ebia na ɛyɛ pon no nan nkutoo.
Other than that, it should be fine.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ papa.
What? 	Dɛn?
This is not a good thing, this should never happen.	Eyi nyɛ ade pa, ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi ba da.
I hope you do too.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo nso wobɛyɛ saa.
The idea is simple.	Adwene no yɛ mmerɛw.
It is not a necessary condition for its species.	Ɛnyɛ tebea a ɛho hia ma ne su.
This just doesn’t follow.	Eyi nni akyi kɛkɛ.
Give me what we both want.	Ma me nea yɛn baanu nyinaa pɛ.
Our food is scarce.	Yɛn aduan ho ayɛ na.
This is very important to me.	Eyi ho hia me paa.
The end of summer.	Awɔw bere awiei.
And so he brings it.	Na enti ɔde ba.
Even years after this.	Wɔ eyi akyi mpo mfe pii.
Most people do that.	Nnipa dodow no ara yɛ saa.
Use what works.	Fa nea ɛyɛ adwuma no di dwuma.
It's amazingly good.	Eye a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There are several reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na eyi fi saa.
It’s a bit like a movie set.	Ɛte sɛ sini a wɔde asi hɔ kakra.
Your mother is right.	Wo maame asɛm no yɛ nokware.
It’s just some wet and cold.	Ɛyɛ nsu ne awɔw bi nkutoo.
This is not our problem.	Eyi nyɛ yɛn haw.
Do it in time for the meeting!	Yɛ no bere ano ma nhyiam no!
Two years later.	Mfe abien akyi.
I don’t want to do these things.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa nneɛma yi.
It works well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
I don’t really have to question that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ migye saa asɛm no ho kyim ankasa.
Both types work extremely well.	Ahorow abien no nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
I had time yet, but probably not much at all.	Ná mewɔ bere de besi nnɛ, nanso ebia na ɛnyɛ pii koraa.
It’s still there.	Ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
Water is life.	Nsu yɛ nkwa.
Get him out of here.	Fa no fi ha.
I put it down.	Mede sii fam.
None of them said anything.	Wɔn mu biara anka hwee.
This was absolutely devastating for him.	Ná eyi yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu koraa ma no.
There is no more money in it.	Sika biara nni mu bio.
Be careful of him.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ ne ho.
It would have been much easier.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
Even his car was a target.	Ná ne kar mpo yɛ nea wɔde wɔn ani asi so.
You will make a serious mistake.	Wobɛyɛ mfomso kɛse bi.
I’ll be very happy with it.	M’ani begye ho yiye.
It has to be that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
These songs were completely unfamiliar.	Ná saa nnwom yi nnim koraa.
This can be whatever you want.	Eyi betumi ayɛ nea wopɛ biara.
You can play them.	Wubetumi ayɛ wɔn ho agoru.
When you put it that way, it seems okay.	Sɛ wode to hɔ saa a, ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ hwee.
Can anyone help me with this.	So obi betumi aboa me wɔ eyi ho.
The truth is the truth.	Nokware yɛ nokware.
My plan didn’t work out.	Me nhyehyɛe no ankɔ yiye.
I am doing my best.	Mereyɛ nea metumi biara.
The morning was amazing.	Ná anɔpa no yɛ nwonwa.
There are many different reasons for this.	Nneɛma ahorow pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
I hope this reaches you the right way.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ eyi bɛkɔ wo nkyɛn ɔkwan pa so.
It must be the stable.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mmoa dan no.
The most important thing here is the people.	Ade a ɛho hia sen biara wɔ ha ne nnipa no.
It’s the water.	Ɛyɛ nsu no.
What's left of him.	Nea aka wɔ ne ho.
He claps his hands.	Ɔbɔ ne nsa so.
A picture is attached.	Wɔde mfonini bi abɔ mu.
Everything was new, and it all felt so amazing.	Ná biribiara yɛ foforo, na na ne nyinaa te nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
You can see this in the books.	Wubetumi ahu eyi wɔ nhoma ahorow no mu.
People are getting into it.	Nkurɔfo rekɔ mu.
I wanted to give them that power.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mede saa tumi no ma wɔn.
Maybe one day.	Ebia da bi.
Unless it’s true.	Gye sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
It was none of these things.	Na ɛnyɛ saa nneɛma yi mu biara.
They stay for days at room temperature.	Wɔde nna pii tra dan mu hyew mu.
The child is not cute and neither is the dress.	Abofra no nyɛ fɛ na saa ara nso na atade no nyɛ fɛ.
I didn’t like either book.	Ná m’ani nnye nhoma abien no mu biara ho.
He has done it well.	Wayɛ no yiye.
If you’re happy where you are, good for you.	Sɛ w’ani gye wɔ baabi a wowɔ a, eye ma wo.
The better the better.	Dodow a wɔyɛ no yiye no, dodow no ara na eye.
This is the hard part of the thing.	Eyi ne ade no fã a ɛyɛ den.
You know, when he.	Wunim, bere a ɔno.
What they like, we like.	Nea wɔn ani gye ho no, yɛn ani gye ho.
And, trust me, there’s plenty if you get your hands on it.	Na, gye me di, pii wɔ hɔ sɛ wo nsa ka a.
This was important to him.	Ná eyi ho hia no.
The whole city is excited about the project.	Kurow no nyinaa ani agye adwuma no ho.
There was no one at the door at the time.	Saa bere no na obiara nni ɔpon no ano.
Nothing, either.	Biribiara nni hɔ, nso.
In my room.	Wɔ me dan mu.
Why did he do that.	Dɛn nti na ɔyɛɛ saa.
I am so sorry about it.	Mepa ho kyɛw kɛse.
Everyone said he was.	Obiara kae sɛ ɔte saa.
Why not do that now.	Dɛn nti na wonyɛ saa mprempren.
Force everyone out of there.	Hyɛ obiara mfi hɔ.
I don’t like him.	M’ani nnye ne ho.
You know that’s in my power.	Wunim sɛ ɛno wɔ me tumi mu.
I just wish there were more of them.	Me yam a anka wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ ara kwa.
I quickly move out of his way.	Meyɛ ntɛm tu fi ne kwan so.
Doubt.	Nnye nni.
He had to play another game.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ agoru foforo.
First, this is a big month for us.	Nea edi kan no, eyi yɛ ɔsram kɛse ma yɛn.
Eat less and more often.	Di kakraa bi na mpɛn pii.
Which is amazing.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Get involved in it.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu.
This point is important.	Saa asɛm yi ho hia.
It’s just the way things are in our city.	Ɛyɛ sɛnea nneɛma te wɔ yɛn kurow no mu ara kwa.
You just use it for something else.	Wode yɛ ade foforo ara kwa.
And he didn’t want to do that.	Na na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Besides being such an interesting idea for the film.	Adwene a ɛte saa a ɛyɛ anigye ma sini no da nkyɛn a.
You are doing great, keep up the good work.	Woreyɛ kɛse, kɔ so yɛ adwuma pa.
I want to be on the list of one.	Mepɛ sɛ mewɔ biako din mu.
He was completely normal.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔte ase koraa.
So much work.	Adwuma pii saa.
After that, it’s up to you.	Ɛno akyi no, ɛyɛ wo na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
She was worried about her children.	Ná ne mma ho asɛm haw no.
What are the ingredients?	Dɛn ne nneɛma a wɔde yɛ aduan no?
He can always work on them with us.	Obetumi ayɛ wɔn ho adwuma bere nyinaa wɔ yɛn nkyɛn.
Something has happened though.	Biribi ayɛ nanso.
Tell us where you are.	Ka baabi a wowɔ kyerɛ yɛn.
Or the incident.	Anaasɛ asɛm a esii.
We all remember that horrible story.	Yɛn nyinaa kae saa asɛm a ɛyɛ hu no.
However, that is not the case here.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte wɔ ha.
In this case, he just didn’t know anything.	Wɔ saa asɛm yi mu no, na onnim hwee kɛkɛ.
Truth can only picture it as the monster it is.	Nokware betumi ayɛ ho mfonini sɛ aboa kɛse a ɔte no nkutoo.
We can help provide that.	Yebetumi aboa ma wɔde saa asɛm no ama.
This kid can play.	Saa abofra yi betumi abɔ.
No one knows what you want but you.	Obiara nnim nea wopɛ gye wo nkutoo.
Most people do that.	Nnipa dodow no ara yɛ saa.
It is easy for him to say.	Ɛnyɛ den mma no sɛ ɔbɛka.
There are many types of memory.	Nneɛma ahorow pii wɔ hɔ a wɔde kae ade.
I knew it was going to be bad.	Ná minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ bɔne.
I wanted him to sleep with the bed and nothing else.	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔde mpa no da na ɛnyɛ biribi foforo biara.
There’s a nice presence on the other end of town.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ kurow no ano foforo.
It was just a lot of work to get here.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse ara kwa sɛ mɛkɔ ha.
She was the mother of his son.	Na ɔyɛ ne ba no maame.
I’m happy with my opinion.	M’ani gye m’adwene ho.
No one really cared.	Ná obiara mfa ne ho ankasa.
That was certainly the case for me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛte saa wɔ me fam.
Again, an additive.	Bio nso, ade a wɔde ka ho.
what is the new job like?.	adwuma foforo no te dɛn?.
That’s what our people don’t know.	Ɛno ne nea yɛn nkurɔfo nnim.
They were worried about me.	Ná me ho asɛm haw wɔn.
Tonight it will be my bed.	Anadwo yi na ɛbɛyɛ me mpa.
It has a lot of features.	Ɛwɔ nneɛma pii.
It’s quite simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
It’s that time again.	Ɛyɛ saa bere no bio.
Add yours today.	Fa wo de ka ho nnɛ.
He had better get used to it.	Ná eye sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ne su.
Look at that kid.	Hwɛ saa abofra no.
That was a few years ago.	Ɛno yɛ mfe kakraa bi a atwam ni.
There was nothing else.	Na biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
This school is great.	Saa sukuu yi yɛ kɛse.
One of two things would happen.	Ná nneɛma abien no mu biako bɛba.
Obviously it should be.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
You are a wonderful human being.	Woyɛ onipa a wo ho yɛ nwonwa.
And thank you!!.	Na meda wo ase!!.
But if you do, just be careful.	Nanso sɛ woyɛ saa a, hwɛ yiye ara kwa.
She is really really nice.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa ankasa.
Watch and talk about it.	Hwɛ na ka ho asɛm.
It’s done for you.	Ayɛ ama wo.
Don't even know what that means.	Nnim nea ɛno kyerɛ mpo.
It’s hard to keep up with them.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wo ne wɔn bɛbɔ.
The girl had short hair.	Ná abeawa no ti nhwi yɛ tiaa.
You love to drive and look good while doing it.	W’ani gye ho sɛ wobɛka kar na wo ho ayɛ fɛ bere a woreyɛ no.
He has known her ever since.	Onim no fi saa bere no.
That is not the case here.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte wɔ ha.
There were also books, bad books.	Ná nhoma ahorow nso wɔ hɔ, nhoma bɔne.
Instead of this.	Sɛ́ anka ɛbɛyɛ eyi.
There is a story behind this.	Asɛm bi wɔ eyi akyi.
It seemed to be in the game.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ agoru no mu.
They are so good, and you were so easy.	Wɔyɛ papa paa, na na wo ho yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
I use this one.	Mede eyi di dwuma.
The animals live close to humans.	Mmoa no te bɛn nnipa.
His hair must be very thin.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ne ti nhwi yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
These statements are outdated.	Saa nsɛm yi ne bere atwam.
The water was warm.	Ná nsu no mu yɛ hyew.
Put me in the water.	Fa me to nsu no mu.
It’s not even new.	Ɛnyɛ ade foforo mpo.
Or one of them.	Anaasɛ wɔn mu biako.
I probably would have done that.	Ebia anka mɛyɛ saa.
As soon as possible.	Ntɛm ara sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye biara.
But it wasn’t him.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɔno.
It will be important.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛho hia.
Look at a part of the person.	Hwɛ sɛnea onipa no fã bi te.
Many people criticized the plan.	Nnipa pii kasa tiaa nhyehyɛe no.
What they have to do.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He knows why he is there.	Onim nea enti a ɔwɔ hɔ.
I don't have any.	Minni bi.
However, this is not possible.	Nanso, eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
But it’s still moving too fast.	Nanso ɛda so ara rekɔ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
He was very worried about the girl.	Ná abeawa no ho asɛm haw no kɛse.
I know you can do it.	Minim sɛ wubetumi ayɛ.
I feel it.	Mete nka.
This was the most dangerous situation.	Ná eyi ne tebea a asiane wom sen biara.
Maybe that’s not necessarily a bad thing.	Ebia ɛno nyɛ ade bɔne ankasa.
This surprises me.	Eyi ma me ho dwiriw me.
And they do that.	Na wɔyɛ saa.
I think this is your best shot in this outfit.	Misusuw sɛ eyi ne wo tuo a eye sen biara wɔ saa atade yi mu.
It should work now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma mprempren.
Just a boy.	Abarimaa bi kɛkɛ.
I just think it’s fantastic.	Misusuw kɛkɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
A first you.	A nea edi kan wo.
He thought he was being so hard.	Ná osusuw sɛ ɔreyɛ den saa.
It’s the next big thing.	Ɛyɛ ade kɛse a edi hɔ.
I'm doing something wrong.	Meyɛ biribi bɔne.
It’s like a problem.	Ɛte sɛ ɔhaw.
And not a little bit.	Na ɛnyɛ kakra.
I feel it, and it’s hard.	Mete nka, na ɛyɛ den.
This can go either way.	Eyi betumi akɔ ɔkwan abien no nyinaa so.
Let’s improve our test results!	Momma yɛn sɔhwɛ aba no nkɔ anim!
All of you.	Mo nyinaa.
The things are close.	Nneɛma no bɛn.
He knows the story well.	Onim asɛm no yiye.
We can see a lot of things.	Yebetumi ahu nneɛma pii.
See below for more.	Hwɛ ase hɔ.
Easy walking for the most part.	Nantew a ɛnyɛ den wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu.
He's just bad, right now.	Ɔyɛ bɔne ara kwa, seesei ara.
Everyone looked at the door.	Obiara hwɛɛ ɔpon no ano.
You know better.	Wo na wunim yiye.
It was mine.	Ná ɛyɛ me de.
Over time, you will.	Bere kɔ so no, wobɛyɛ saa.
I am a good girl.	Meyɛ abeawa pa.
So many things to consider.	Enti nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
It was a pleasure.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye.
I’m a movie star.	M’ani gye sini ho.
I was looking out my window.	Ná mehwɛ me mfɛnsere mu.
He looked really bad.	Ná ne ho yɛ bɔne ankasa.
He wasn't hurting me now.	Ná ɔnyɛ me yaw mprempren.
This is the new one.	Eyi ne foforo no.
They were beautiful.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
I love everything about it.	M’ani gye ho biribiara ho.
And they keep going.	Na wɔ so kɔ.
He told her that it was too cold.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ awɔw wom dodo.
He was a man who knew the situation.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima bi a onim tebea no.
He was doing that.	Ná ɔyɛ saa.
This food is.	Saa aduan yi ne.
You are the boy’s father.	Wo ne abarimaa no papa.
The water felt pleasant.	Ná nsu no te nka sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
Don’t see him.	Nhu no.
You might even be interested.	Ebia w’ani begye ho mpo.
My dog ​​loves it.	Me kraman ani gye ho.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
So we did something with that.	Enti yɛde saa asɛm no yɛɛ biribi.
It’s going to be a long night, though.	Ɛbɛyɛ anadwo tenten, nanso.
He did not know these people.	Ná onnim saa nkurɔfo yi.
In our own time.	Wɔ yɛn ankasa bere so.
He will use you.	Ɔde wo bedi dwuma.
The music itself begins.	Nnwom no ankasa fi ase.
I'm working here.	Meyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
It shouldn’t be that way.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
He wants something only you can give him.	Ɔpɛ biribi a wo nkutoo na wubetumi de ama no.
This is one of the beauties.	Eyi yɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ no mu biako.
Or another test.	Anaasɛ sɔhwɛ foforo.
He didn't want to be free.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho.
Not after last night.	Ɛnyɛ anadwo a etwaam no akyi.
I doubt you will.	Migye kyim sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
It was not pleasant at all.	Ná ɛnyɛ anigye koraa.
I want everything done the right way.	Mepɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribiara ɔkwan pa so.
It should be good enough.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He wants to touch them.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka wɔn.
Not much, really.	Ɛnyɛ pii, ampa.
I still believe it’s a great idea.	Meda so ara gye di sɛ ɛyɛ adwene kɛse.
Not ideal at all.	Ɛnyɛ nea eye koraa.
If he could convince her.	Sɛ obetumi agye no adi a.
Let me do the work.	Ma menyɛ adwuma.
Go to the door.	Kɔ ɔpon no ano.
You do not need to add this.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode eyi bɛka ho.
Almost no one attends the meeting.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara nkɔ nhyiam no ase.
Baby.	Baabi.
But no one raised his hand.	Nanso obiara amma ne nsa so.
All the kids have to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra no nyinaa yɛ.
The problem with this approach is child programs.	Ɔhaw a ɛwɔ saa kwan yi so ne mmofra nhyehyɛe ahorow.
None of that mattered at the time.	Ná ɛno mu biara ho nhia saa bere no.
So that’s the first one.	Enti ɛno ne nea edi kan.
It’s everyone but you.	Ɛyɛ obiara a ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo.
But he must be alone.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
I slipped into my room.	Mede me ho too me dan mu.
I’m happy as often as I’m not.	M’ani gye mpɛn pii te sɛ nea m’ani nnye ho no.
Just as much as you can.	Sɛnea wubetumi ara pɛ.
This really but he did.	Eyi ankasa nanso ɔyɛɛ saa.
I have books.	Mewɔ nhoma ahorow.
The dress was trendy.	Ná atade no yɛ nea aba so.
Nevertheless, however.	Nanso, ne nyinaa mu no.
I tell him the story.	Meka asɛm no kyerɛ no.
I’ll be interested in some way.	M’ani begye ho wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
No one knows why.	Obiara nnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Always have and always will.	Bere nyinaa wowɔ na ɛbɛyɛ bere nyinaa.
He was completely wrong about that.	Ná ɔyɛ mfomso koraa wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
He never liked me.	Ná n’ani nnye me ho da.
It feels like this has all happened so fast.	Ɛte nka sɛ eyi nyinaa aba ntɛmntɛm saa.
Who made all the speech.	Nea ɔyɛɛ kasa no nyinaa.
I don’t want to think about it tonight, not anymore.	Mempɛ sɛ misusuw ho anadwo yi, ɛnyɛ bio.
It might be something like that.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
But there is another problem where this is not the case.	Nanso ɔhaw foforo wɔ hɔ a eyi nte saa.
But in what way? 	Nanso ɔkwan bɛn so?
I am much bigger than any of them.	Meyɛ kɛse sen wɔn mu biara koraa.
He was here, and he knew it now.	Ná ɔwɔ ha, na onim mprempren.
Lack of time to do the things he wanted.	Bere a onni a ɔde bɛyɛ nneɛma a na ɔpɛ no.
He wasn’t bad at all.	Ná ɔnyɛ bɔne koraa.
The water was teeming with aquatic life.	Ná nsu mu mmoa a ɛdɔɔso ahyɛ nsu no mu ma.
So that’s helpful.	Enti ɛno aboa.
They were all like that.	Ná wɔn nyinaa te saa.
That’s what it was supposed to be.	Saa na na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
Not all of us.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn nyinaa.
But he does do it.	Nanso ɔyɛ saa.
He was very focused.	Ná ɔde n’adwene asi biribi so kɛse.
Most of the day had been spent working on it.	Ná wɔde da no fã kɛse no ara ayɛ ho adwuma.
That would be good.	Ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
What a busy month!	Ɔsram a adagyew nnim bɛn ara ni!
He didn't really know.	Ná onnim ankasa.
Take after your dog.	Fa wo kraman akyi.
Children go to school when they are young.	Mmofra kɔ sukuu bere a wɔyɛ mmofra.
You got wet.	Wo ho yɛɛ wo nsu.
I only got one.	Me nsa kaa biako pɛ.
That would have been crucial.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ nea ɛho hia kɛse.
There were only a few cars left to go.	Ná kar kakraa bi pɛ na aka a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde kɔ.
It was a beautiful offer.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ a wɔde ma.
She feels like a girl.	Ɔte nka sɛ ɔyɛ abeawa.
All things come to an end.	Nneɛma nyinaa ba awiei.
So many people see this as a bad thing.	Enti nnipa pii hu eyi sɛ ade bɔne.
Internal use only.	Nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma wɔ mu nkutoo.
This is pretty amazing, you think.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa yiye, wususuw.
We can’t give you everything you want.	Yɛrentumi mma wo biribiara a wopɛ.
You’re interested in me.	W’ani gye me ho.
Food is scarce, and water is very scarce.	Aduan ho yɛ na, na nsu ho yɛ na yiye.
He wanted me to tell you.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo.
For us it was our privilege to give.	Yɛn fam no na ɛyɛ yɛn hokwan sɛ yɛde bɛma.
Life is short, so seize the day.	Nkwa yɛ tiaa, enti fa da no.
I don’t know how bad it is.	Minnim sɛnea ɛyɛ bɔne fa.
Take time to eat well.	Fa bere di aduan pa.
This will make your hair softer.	Eyi bɛma wo ti nhwi ayɛ mmerɛw.
He looked down at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ fam.
The information given to you.	Asɛm a wɔde ama wo no.
We both know you can do no good.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa nim sɛ worentumi nyɛ papa biara.
The test is critical.	Sɔhwɛ no ho hia kɛse.
The price can be less or more.	Bo no betumi ayɛ kakraa bi anaasɛ ayɛ pii.
Things are not so good these days.	Nneɛma nkɔ yiye saa nnansa yi.
But even after that, it still didn’t work.	Nanso ɛno akyi mpo no, na ɛda so ara ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
But he wants to take that next step.	Nanso ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa ade a edi hɔ no.
It’s just perfect.	Ɛyɛ pɛ ara kwa.
But it’s not realistic.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
I am working tomorrow.	Mereyɛ adwuma ɔkyena.
However, I worked on it.	Nanso, meyɛɛ ho adwuma.
Make yourself look great.	Ma wo ho nyɛ wo kɛse.
He knew his wife well.	Ná onim ne yere yiye.
Not even a dog.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkraman mpo.
But not much at all.	Nanso ɛnyɛ pii koraa.
He had many expensive things.	Ná ɔwɔ nneɛma a ne bo yɛ den pii.
He is there right now.	Ɔwɔ hɔ seesei ara.
You have to do that when you are young.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa bere a woyɛ abofra no.
There is no other book like it.	Nhoma foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ ɛno ankasa.
I made them smarter than they were.	Meyɛɛ wɔn nyansa sen wɔn.
Maybe one day there would be time.	Ebia da bi anka bere bɛba.
Naturally, problems arise.	Sɛnea ɛte no, ɔhaw ahorow ba.
It’s simple and it works.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ adwuma.
There was definitely more to this.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na pii wɔ eyi ho.
He stroked her hair.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne ti nhwi.
But he brought me down.	Nanso ɔde me baa fam.
Often, though, we do a little bit of both.	Nanso, mpɛn pii no, yɛyɛ abien no nyinaa kakra.
But look at us now.	Nanso hwɛ yɛn mprempren.
I believe most people are honest.	Migye di sɛ nnipa dodow no ara di nokware.
And we had fast cars.	Na na yɛwɔ kar ahorow a ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
That’s a real thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade ankasa.
He'll be late for work tonight.	Ɔbɛka akyi wɔ adwuma mu anadwo yi.
I had a hard time putting it down.	Ná ɛyɛ me den sɛ mede besi fam.
Many people use it to deal with back pain.	Nnipa pii de di dwuma de di akyi yaw ho dwuma.
That’s it.	Ɛno ni.
He is not very bright.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hyew kɛse.
He was doing a good job.	Ná ɔreyɛ adwuma pa.
Isn’t it really something.	So ɛnyɛ biribi ankasa.
Display qualities in name form.	Da su ahorow adi wɔ din kwan so.
What was he doing.	Dɛn na na ɔreyɛ.
The truth was a little more complicated.	Ná nokware no mu yɛ den kakra.
Your father has my people.	Wo papa wɔ me nkurɔfo.
We both knew, immediately.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa nim, ntɛm ara.
They talk about it.	Wɔka ho asɛm.
Part of the group.	Kuw no fã bi.
An opportunity to save yourself.	Hokwan a wode begye wo ho.
What is yours?.	Dɛn ne wo de?.
We have food.	Yɛwɔ aduan.
I couldn’t eat anything.	Na mintumi nni hwee.
You do what you can.	Woyɛ nea wubetumi.
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
No one said a word.	Obiara anka asɛm biara.
If anything, things had gone the other way.	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, na nneɛma akɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
That’s the first part of the letter.	Ɛno ne krataa no fã a edi kan.
And it was very quick.	Na ɛyɛ ntɛm paa.
And yet he knew about it.	Na nanso na onim ho asɛm.
Everyone knows that.	Obiara nim saa.
It’s really good.	Eye ankasa.
And he wanted to.	Na na ɔpɛ.
There is no other idea.	Adwene foforo biara nni hɔ.
He was the only male.	Ná ɔno nkutoo ne ɔbarima a ɔyɛ ɔbarima.
You may even give it away.	Ebia wode bɛma mpo.
This has nothing to do with the phone.	Eyi ne telefon no nni hwee yɛ.
I know how horrible things have been for you lately.	Minim sɛnea nneɛma ayɛ hu ama wo nnansa yi.
You just set it up.	Wode asi hɔ ara kwa.
One of my many, many projects.	Me nnwuma pii, pii no mu biako.
And he will go down.	Na ɔbɛkɔ fam.
They were really great fun for the first month or so.	Na wɔyɛ anigye kɛse ankasa wɔ ɔsram a edi kan anaa nea ɛte saa no mu.
So how do you do it.	Enti sɛnea wobɛyɛ.
Providing good food.	Aduan pa a wɔde ma.
Consider school pictures.	Susuw sukuu mfonini ahorow ho hwɛ.
Friends of friends.	Nnamfo a wɔyɛ nnamfo.
Never so fast.	Ɛnyɛ ntɛmntɛm saa da.
Clearly, something bad had happened.	Ɛda adi sɛ na biribi bɔne bi asi.
Nothing wrong with the game.	Mfomso biara nni agoru no ho.
In time, they became much better.	Bere kɔɔ so no, wɔn ho tɔɔ wɔn kɛse.
But it was definitely very impressive.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
The kitten lied to us.	Ɔkraman ba no dii atoro kyerɛɛ yɛn.
This can cause stocks to decline over time.	Eyi betumi ama nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no akɔ fam bere kɔ so no.
Do a better job than that.	Yɛ adwuma a eye sen saa.
He had a few friends.	Ná ɔwɔ nnamfo kakraa bi.
But this is not the case.	Nanso eyi nte saa.
Nothing matters but you.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛho hia gye wo.
The people will move on.	Nkurɔfo no bɛkɔ so.
We all have to do well.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa yɛ yiye.
Maybe he had something there.	Ebia na ɔwɔ biribi wɔ hɔ.
Our school is in the city.	Yɛn sukuu no wɔ kurow no mu.
More of that will come later.	Saa pii bɛba akyiri yi.
The water feels pretty tight right now.	Nsu no te nka sɛ ɛyɛ den yiye mprempren.
We can make an effort.	Yebetumi abɔ mmɔden.
Maybe it sounds like you say.	Ebia ɛte sɛ nea woka no.
But at the time, everything seemed possible.	Nanso saa bere no na ɛte sɛ nea biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye.
There is always more.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
Everyone looks at everyone else.	Obiara hwɛ obiara a aka no.
All my friends are there.	Me nnamfo nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
He seemed happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
You have done well indeed.	Woayɛ no yiye ampa.
Not in his room.	Ɛnyɛ ne dan mu.
He had done so.	Ná wayɛ saa.
One thing he doesn’t quite do.	Ade biako a onni mu yiye.
There is no such thing there.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa wɔ hɔ.
Every single part of it.	Ne fã biako biara.
At this point the party was in full swing.	Saa bere yi na apontow no rekɔ so kɛse.
Some things are best forgotten.	Nneɛma bi yɛ papa sɛ wo werɛ mfi.
Talk to someone.	Kasa kyerɛ obi.
No one is stronger than he is.	Obiara nni hɔ a ne ho yɛ den sen no.
It’s a great opportunity.	Ɛyɛ hokwan kɛse.
Night closed the day.	Anadwo too mu awia no.
It was nothing at all.	Ná ɛnyɛ hwee koraa.
For about a year.	Bɛyɛ afe biako.
At the time, it would have been.	Saa bere no, anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
But the story kept making money.	Nanso asɛm no kɔɔ so yɛɛ sika.
A car needs road space.	Kar hia kwan so baabi.
This will only make you bigger.	Eyi bɛma woayɛ kɛse ara kwa.
However, he was great.	Nanso, na ɔyɛ kɛse.
He's almost really amazing.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
He seems attractive to people.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ fɛ ma nkurɔfo.
This girl reminds me of kindergarten.	Abeawa yi kae me mmofra sukuu.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani gyee ho saa.
Look closely at this picture.	Hwɛ mfonini yi yiye.
We made it down the road.	Yɛde kwan no faa kwan no so.
It would all come to an end.	Ná ne nyinaa bɛba awiei koraa.
This will keep the meeting more organized.	Eyi bɛma nhyiam no akɔ so ayɛ nhyehyɛe kɛse.
It works in everything, including personal circumstances.	Ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ biribiara mu, a obi ankasa tebea ka ho.
She was a good girl.	Ná ɔyɛ abeawa pa.
This was not really a good thing.	Ná eyi nyɛ ade pa ankasa.
I've been cold.	Mayɛ awɔw.
I have to be there.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ.
But how do you do that.	Nanso wobɛyɛ dɛn ayɛ saa.
The concept is really quite simple.	Adwene no yɛ mmerɛw koraa ankasa.
And these things run into a certain amount of money.	Na saa nneɛma yi tu mmirika kɔ sika dodow bi mu.
He wasn’t doing anything wrong.	Ná ɔnyɛ bɔne biara.
There is still time to do something.	Bere da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribi.
Look at what you’ve done.	Hwɛ nea woayɛ.
There is a.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a.
We could have found a way.	Anka yebetumi anya ɔkwan bi.
He never does that.	Ɔnyɛ saa da.
It must be true.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
My kids and I saw it again last night.	Me ne me mma no huu no bio anadwo a etwaam no.
It’s a sin.	Bɔne na ɛyɛ.
It’s much, much bigger.	Ɛyɛ kɛse, kɛse sen saa.
And keep doing it.	Na kɔ so yɛ.
He could watch the movie if he wanted to.	Ná obetumi ahwɛ sini no sɛ ɔpɛ a.
He kicked the door shut.	Ɔde ne nan bɔɔ ɔpon no mu.
And the participants knew it.	Na na wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ mu no nim.
It would have been better.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ papa.
Maybe I can help.	Ebia metumi aboa.
It was strangely unnecessary.	Ná ɛho nhia wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
There are books, there are pictures.	Nhoma ahorow wɔ hɔ, mfonini ahorow wɔ hɔ.
The subject of this article is one such case.	Asɛm a ɛwɔ asɛm yi mu no yɛ nneɛma a ɛte saa no mu biako.
In my opinion, it wasn’t that good.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no, na ɛnyɛ papa saa.
They are simply beautiful.	Wɔyɛ fɛ ara kwa.
I'm sure they enjoyed it.	Migye di sɛ wɔn ani gyee ho.
Go back to work.	San kɔ adwuma.
Right now.	Mprempren yi ara.
When you are important to you.	Bere a wo ho hia wo no.
But it was nothing harmless that night.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ biribi a asiane biara nni ho saa anadwo no.
Don’t believe him.	Nnye no nni.
This has	Eyi ama .
The child excitedly told her how much she liked him.	Abofra no de anigye kaa sɛnea n’ani gye ne ho no kyerɛɛ no.
I hope we don't have to do this in the winter.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ eyi wɔ awɔw bere mu.
Everyone fell for it.	Obiara hwee ase wɔ ho.
Or even dinner.	Anaasɛ anwummere aduan mpo.
I have mastered part of his complex mind.	Mayɛ n’adwene a ɛyɛ den no fã bi yiye.
I can tell you what to do about that.	Metumi aka nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wɔ saa asɛm no ho akyerɛ wo.
However, it is a good idea.	Nanso, ɛyɛ adwene pa.
You just have to tell them the truth.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka nokware no kyerɛ wɔn ara kwa.
Everyone has a right.	Obiara wɔ hokwan.
It was brand new.	Ná ɛyɛ foforo koraa.
This species is still endangered.	Saa mmoa yi da so ara wɔ asiane mu.
Musical instruments are one of his passions.	Nnwom a wɔde bɔ nnwom yɛ nneɛma a n’ani gye ho no mu biako.
I had never thought about it.	Ná minsusuw ho da.
He would make good out of evil.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ papa afi bɔne mu.
I would, these days.	Anka mɛyɛ, nnansa yi.
I still needed to feel his hand in mine.	Ná ɛda so ara hia sɛ mete ne nsa nka wɔ me de mu.
First, one comes out.	Nea edi kan no, biako fi adi.
I was put there.	Wɔde me too hɔ.
However, the group seems to have had some success.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea kuw no dii yiye kakra.
I wasn’t even human anymore.	Ná menyɛ onipa mpo bio.
Not that it looked hard.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
Many of the controls were needed.	Ná ɛho hia sɛ wɔyɛ nneɛma pii a wɔde di dwuma no.
Outside the room.	Wɔ dan no akyi.
But you can’t use that language anymore.	Nanso worentumi mfa saa kasa no nni dwuma bio.
I liked this the best.	M’ani gyee eyi ho sen biara.
I think about it all the time.	Misusuw ho bere nyinaa.
That is a wonderful statement.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I just want to forget it all.	Mepɛ sɛ me werɛ fi ne nyinaa ara kwa.
I love to drive.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛka kar.
Time was and time was not.	Na bere yɛ na bere nso nyɛ saa.
I don’t know anything about it.	Minnim ho hwee.
He was a really nice guy.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa pa ankasa.
But no one seems to know where he is.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea obiara nnim baabi a ɔwɔ.
I told him that there was nothing to say.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a ɔbɛka ho asɛm.
That’s why that whole picture is wrong, you know.	Ɛno nti na saa mfonini no nyinaa yɛ mfomso, wunim.
That’s a surprise.	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
Do not use this product on the floor.	Mfa saa ade yi nni dwuma wɔ fam.
This is very interesting for presentations.	Eyi yɛ anigye kɛse ma nsɛm a wɔka kyerɛ.
But we can do something about this.	Nanso yebetumi ayɛ eyi ho biribi.
I still have never heard of you.	Meda so ara nte wo ho asɛm da.
Another group was in front of his.	Ná kuw foforo wɔ ne de no anim.
Take care of it.	Hwɛ so yiye.
Say that to yourself now.	Ka saa kyerɛ wo ho mprempren.
Do the work.	Yɛ adwuma no.
People should take advantage of the opportunity.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo de hokwan no di dwuma.
Someone who knows him.	Obi a onim no.
It’s too cold, anyway.	Ɛyɛ awɔw dodo, ɔkwan biara so.

It’s still pretty simple.	Ɛda so ara yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
But this game is hard.	Nanso saa agoru yi yɛ den.
It’s cold outside.	Ɛyɛ awɔw wɔ abɔnten.

It’s almost like this.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte sɛ eyi.
He is unpleasant to work with.	Ɔyɛ obi a n’ani nnye ho sɛ wo ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.

He doesn’t live with them.	Ɔne wɔn nte.
I would love it in the house.	M’ani begye ho kɛse wɔ fie hɔ.
As great as it is.	Sɛnea ɛyɛ kɛse no.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ebia ɛte saa ara.
I don’t think this is true.	Minsusuw sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.

It’s the only game where you actually see them.	Ɛno nkutoo ne agoru a wuhu wɔn ankasa.

He’s very interested in it.	N’ani gye ho kɛse.
It is important to know that you are not alone.	Ɛho hia sɛ wuhu sɛ ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo.
He could easily, but he had a better idea.	Ná ɛnyɛ den sɛ obetumi ayɛ saa, nanso na ɔwɔ adwene a eye sen saa.
Danger was the whole point.	Ná asiane ne asɛm no nyinaa.

There is no such situation here.	Tebea a ɛte saa biara nni ha.
Just go with your will.	Fa wo pɛ kɔ kɛkɛ.
At this point the game begins.	Saa bere yi na agoru no fi ase.
There is nothing else but you.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ gye wo.
And thank you, guys.	Na meda wo ase.
But it is not his equal.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɔne no yɛ pɛ.

It’s not a man’s house.	Ɛnyɛ ɔbarima bi fie.
But we can say more.	Nanso yebetumi aka pii.
I saw his full name, for the first time.	Mihuu ne din mũ no nyinaa, nea edi kan.
And he could do that.	Na na obetumi ayɛ saa.
Superior.	Di so.
Do you want to get involved with the kids?	So wopɛ sɛ wo ne mmofra no de wo ho hyɛ mu?
I want to see anything else.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu biribi foforo biara.
In both cases.	Wɔ nsɛm abien no nyinaa mu.
This time, he put her away.	Saa bere yi de, ɔde no too hɔ.
They shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.

Don’t think of me as your mother anymore.	Nsusuw me ho sɛ wo maame bio.
Take it and go.	Fa no na kɔ.
He had done it.	Ná wayɛ no.

You have to prioritize everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode biribiara di kan.
One look was enough.	Ná hwɛ biako a ɛdɔɔso.
A problem, that.	A ɔhaw bi, ɛno.
There is not much in them.	Nneɛma pii nni wɔn mu.
Lunch is now over.	Mprempren awia aduan aba awiei.
You know the few you can see.	Wunim kakraa bi a wubetumi ahu no.

He was a child.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra.
He was sitting there.	Ná ɔte hɔ.
There was something out there.	Na biribi wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
This one was the best.	Ná eyi yɛ nea eye sen biara.
He doesn’t want to tell his father.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ ne papa.
It’s very difficult.	Ɛyɛ den yiye.
It was a terrific thrill.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye a ɛyɛ hu.
Something, someone was there with him.	Biribi, na obi ka ne ho wɔ hɔ.
Still, it was fun.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ anigye.
He wanted this to be the first test.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ eyi yɛ sɔhwɛ a edi kan.
It is part of me, and you are only temporary.	Ɛyɛ me fã, na woyɛ bere tiaa mu de nkutoo.
That’s a huge one.	Ɛno yɛ kɛse.
In this way, the book begins innocently enough.	Saa kwan yi so no, nhoma no fi ase a ɛho nni asɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
You are not my son.	Wonyɛ me ba.
My head starts pounding.	Me ti fi ase bɔ.
Maybe something that doesn’t hurt .	Ebia biribi a ɛnyɛ yaw .
At least not this time.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ saa bere yi.
Watch and remember.	Hwɛ na kae.
Always be careful.	Hwɛ yiye bere nyinaa.

He had a gunshot wound to the head.	Ná wɔde tuo abɔ ne ti.
But sleep at night.	Nanso anadwo da.

It doesn’t matter the way people talk to you.	Ɔkwan a nkurɔfo fa so kasa kyerɛ wo no nnye hwee.
Or so everyone else felt.	Anaasɛ saa na obiara a aka no tee nka.
But you can’t take her out of the house.	Nanso worentumi mfa no mfi fie hɔ.
No car, no money, no sex.	Kar biara nni hɔ, sika biara nni hɔ, nna biara nni hɔ.
No one said a single word about them.	Obiara anka wɔn ho asɛm biako mpo.
That’s not the first few words.	Ɛno nyɛ nsɛm a edi kan no.
You’ll be fascinated by them.	W’ani begye wɔn ho.
We can start again.	Yebetumi afi ase bio.
And only one of them wins.	Na wɔn mu biako pɛ na odi nkonim.
Maybe he wasn’t such a nice guy after all.	Ebia na ɔnyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ saa wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
This project is still pending.	Saa adwuma yi da so ara wɔ hɔ.
He pointed out the window.	Ɔde ne nsa fii mfɛnsere no mu kyerɛɛ no.

The launch was successful.	Wɔde sii hɔ no dii yiye.
Might as well be okay with that.	Ebia na ɛbɛyɛ yiye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Only the other danger.	Asiane foforo no nkutoo.
That was a mistake.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfomso bi.
And even it gets better.	Na mpo ɛyɛ yiye.
I have brought this up a couple of times.	Mede eyi aba mpɛn abien.
He is not a human being.	Ɔnyɛ onipa.

Does anyone know him well.	So obi nim no yiye.
Nothing seems to surprise them anymore.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara nyɛ wɔn nwonwa bio.
The more you can do, the better.	Dodow a wubetumi ayɛ no, dodow no ara na eye.

Here is another article of interest.	Asɛm foforo a w’ani begye ho ni.
I am a human being.	Meyɛ onipa.

However, there was no one in the house.	Nanso, na obiara nni ofie no mu.

You can’t control people.	Worentumi nni nnipa so.
He wasn’t wrong.	Ná ɔnyɛ mfomso.
I’m a working man, and you’re not.	Meyɛ ɔbarima a ɔyɛ adwuma, na wo nso wonyɛ saa.
It’s perfect, every time.	Ɛyɛ pɛ, bere biara.
A good man is no longer.	Onipa pa nyɛ bio.
You need to talk to them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne wɔn kasa.
It’s not just you and me.	Ɛnyɛ me ne wo nkutoo.

Do you find yourself attracted to him?	So wuhu sɛ w’ani gye ne ho?
Don’t tell him.	Nka no.
I think it may be too late.	Misusuw sɛ ebia aka akyi dodo.
I don’t need to go on.	Ɛho nhia sɛ mekɔ so.
You're doing pretty good about it.	Woreyɛ no yiye yiye wɔ ho.
But most days it wasn’t.	Nanso nna dodow no ara no na ɛnte saa.
So it shouldn’t be about where we do this.	Enti ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ baabi a yɛyɛ eyi no ho asɛm.
You can’t just let yourself.	Worentumi mma wo ho kɛkɛ.
We need to act quickly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi ntɛm.
It was a team effort.	Ná ɛyɛ kuw adwuma.
The first was just something that had to be done.	Ná nea edi kan no yɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ara kwa.
But it was difficult.	Nanso na ɛyɛ den.
Give this to him.	Fa eyi ma no.
Look into someone’s eyes.	Hwɛ obi ani so.
So the path is just a paper path.	Enti ɔkwan no yɛ krataa kwan ara kwa.
The next books pick up where the previous book left off.	Nhoma ahorow a edi hɔ no fa baabi a nhoma a atwam no baa awiei.
It’s all great.	Ne nyinaa yɛ kɛse.

He told you so and that’s what he’s doing.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ wo saa na ɛno na ɔreyɛ.
He was very impressed.	N’ani gyee ho kɛse.
That’s the total cost of the phone.	Ɛno ne telefon no ho ka nyinaa.
But it’s not their business.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm.
It’s hard and it’s hard.	Ɛyɛ den na ɛyɛ den.
In my opinion, there are a number of factors.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no, nneɛma ahorow bi wɔ hɔ.
So the people go back to them.	Enti nkurɔfo no san kɔ wɔn nkyɛn.
Speak a little.	Kasa kakra.

However, I really like it.	Nanso, mepɛ no ankasa.
First, nothing is as simple as it seems.	Nea edi kan no, biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛte no.
However, this does not make the conclusions any less important.	Nanso, eyi mma nsɛm a wɔde baa awiei no ho nhia pii.

Watch out for those kids!	Hwɛ yiye wɔ saa mmofra no ho!
But it’s still there.	Nanso ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
Which is, with something so big.	Nea ɛwɔ hɔ, a biribi kɛse saa ka ho.

Water should always be used sparingly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde nsu di dwuma kakraa bi bere nyinaa.

Show and win, everything.	Kyerɛ na di nkonim, biribiara.
There was simply no way.	Ná ɔkwan biara nni hɔ kɛkɛ.
No mistake, nothing.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ, biribiara nni hɔ.
It’s not the nature of anything.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara su.
It really is something you have to work on every day.	Ɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho adwuma da biara da ampa.
Work a few hours.	Yɛ adwuma nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi.
He never does that.	Ɔnyɛ saa da.
However, mental images do exist.	Nanso, adwene mu mfonini ahorow wɔ hɔ ampa.
About last night.	Bɛyɛ anadwo a atwam no.
That ended the story.	Ɛno de asɛm no baa awiei.
We have something in common.	Yɛwɔ biribi a ɛyɛ pɛ.

His sin was the same.	Ná ne bɔne yɛ ade koro.
He should have been more careful.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ n’adwene yiye.
It’s such a fun day, isn’t it?	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye saa, ɛnte saa?
His mother was in great pain.	Ná ne maame te yaw kɛse.
Not many pictures, as pictures go.	Ɛnyɛ mfonini pii, sɛnea mfonini ahorow kɔ no.

And afterwards the people have responded.	Na akyi no nkurɔfo no ayɛ ho biribi.
He had forgotten about that.	Ná ne werɛ afi saa asɛm no.

I just can’t reach them.	Mintumi nkɔ wɔn nkyɛn kɛkɛ.
The surface of the moon is slightly uneven.	Ɔsram no ani nyɛ pɛ kakra.
Their clothes are beautiful and elegant.	Wɔn ntade yɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ fɛ.
The wrong way.	Ɔkwan bɔne no.
We are very happy.	Yɛwɔ anigye kɛse.
The same is true of ourselves.	Saa ara na yɛn ankasa nso te.
It’s that time of year again.	Ɛyɛ saa bere no wɔ afe no mu bio.
Assume everything will take longer than you think.	Fa no sɛ biribiara begye bere tenten sen sɛnea wususuw.
This is the latest version.	Eyi ne nea aba foforo.
You need to know how to work the resources.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu sɛnea wobɛyɛ nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma no ho adwuma.
However, these issues have no application here.	Nanso, nsɛm yi nni dwuma biara wɔ ha.
There was only one bed, but he didn't care.	Ná mpa biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ, nanso na ɛnyɛ no asɛm.
He has a lot to tell her.	Ɔwɔ pii ka kyerɛ no.
But it wasn’t one.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ biako.
Until he.	Kosi sɛ ɔno.
He obviously knew her.	Ná ɛda adi sɛ onim no.
He looked at us with hope.	Ɔde anidaso hwɛɛ yɛn.
But it is too late.	Nanso aka akyi paa.
We could have done a lot better.	Anka yebetumi ayɛ pii a eye sen saa.
But for now, it is what it is.	Nanso mprempren de, ɛyɛ nea ɛte.
Do not get out of bed.	Mma mfi mpa so nkɔ fam.
He wanted to think things through.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ osusuw nneɛma ho yiye.
A was a very handsome man.	Ná A yɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I don’t want anything.	Mempɛ biribiara.
With power, we can add money.	Sɛ yɛde tumi di dwuma a, yebetumi de sika aka ho.
I loved doing such a great job.	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ adwuma kɛse saa.
He stepped into the water.	Ɔde ne nan sii nsu no mu.
But he could see it.	Nanso na obetumi ahu.
Remove everything from it.	Yi biribiara fi so.
Every day there would be a new door.	Ná da biara da ɔpon foforo bɛba.
Are we a bit excited about our new bike????.	So yɛn ani agye kakra wɔ yɛn sakre foforo no ho????.
Not because of me.	Ɛnyɛ me nti.
However, there is no happiness.	Nanso, anigye biara nni hɔ.
But this doesn’t work.	Nanso eyi nyɛ adwuma.
You can see the cover photo below.	Wubetumi ahu mfonini a ɛwɔ anim no wɔ ase hɔ.
All that trouble.	Saa ɔhaw no nyinaa.
There was only one way.	Ná ɔkwan biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
He was named after his father.	Wɔde ne papa din too no.
Every man is important.	Ɔbarima biara ho hia.
So we will include them here.	Enti yɛde wɔn bɛka ho wɔ ha.
The task ahead seemed daunting.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea adwuma a ɛda yɛn anim no yɛ den.
A long time ago.	Bere tenten a atwam.
Have .	Wɔ .
Unless someone tells him.	Gye sɛ obi aka akyerɛ no.
No one else came, except him.	Obi foforo biara amma, gye ɔno nkutoo.
But that’s not the point here.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne ade a ɛho hia wɔ ha.
Tell them you enjoyed it.	Ka kyerɛ wɔn sɛ w’ani gyee ho.
I can handle that.	Metumi adi saa asɛm no ho dwuma.
It was no surprise that his head was missing.	Ná ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ ne ti nni hɔ.
And that’s about it, too.	Na ɛno nso fa ho.
I don’t need a job.	Adwuma ho nhia me.
He does that now.	Ɔyɛ saa mprempren.
My children are real people.	Me mma yɛ nnipa ankasa.
It’s a boy!	Ɛyɛ abarimaa!
It’s been that way since we were kids.	Ɛte saa fi bere a na yɛyɛ mmofra no.
So think about what you want.	Enti susuw nea wopɛ ho.
There is a chance he can win.	Hokwan wɔ hɔ a obetumi adi nkonim.
Even in their sleep they were beautiful.	Wɔ wɔn nna mu mpo no na wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
For many of us, the better.	Yɛn mu pii no, dodow no ara na eye.
I know how exciting it is when they like you.	Minim sɛnea ɛyɛ anigye bere a wɔn ani gye wo ho no.
Sounds familiar to you?	Ɛte sɛ nea wunim no yiye?
Even if we could find someone.	Sɛ mpo yebetumi anya obi a.
I did it right.	Meyɛɛ no ​​yiye.
So we would act like humans.	Enti anka yɛbɛyɛ yɛn ade te sɛ nnipa.
That took much longer.	Ɛno gyee bere tenten sen saa koraa.
I couldn’t afford this opportunity.	Na mintumi nnya hokwan yi.
What it has is very interesting.	Nea ɛwɔ no yɛ anigye kɛse.
If you have a problem, raise your hand.	Sɛ wowɔ ɔhaw bi a, ma wo nsa so.
He is a pragmatist.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔde ne ho hyɛ nneɛma mu.
Any work that is done.	Adwuma biara a wɔyɛ.
However, we are happy.	Nanso, yɛwɔ anigye.
Forget him, girl.	Wo werɛ mfi no, abeawa.
It was supposed to be a wonderful party.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ apontow a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It’s not a realistic one.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
When they have been working for a long time.	Bere a wɔde bere tenten ayɛ adwuma.
The same goes for school.	Saa ara na sukuu nso yɛ.
Shoes are next.	Mpaboa na edi hɔ.
We’ve all seen pictures of it.	Yɛn nyinaa ahu ho mfonini ahorow.
And each other.	Na wɔn ho wɔn ho.
Take a look at it.	Ka ho hwɛ.
That’s what you signed up for.	Ɛno ne nea wode wo din hyɛɛ mu.
And it didn’t seem to be.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛnte saa.
The police eventually found the money.	Awiei koraa no, polisifo no huu sika no.
Beware of the snake!	Hwɛ yiye wɔ ɔwɔ no ho!
But he knew it would be a lie.	Nanso na onim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ atoro.
What a difficult road.	Ɔkwan a ɛyɛ den bɛn ara ni.
For the rest of your life.	Wo nkwa nna a aka nyinaa.
The power was gone.	Ná tumi no afi hɔ.
It’s great, indeed.	Ɛyɛ kɛse, ampa.
Those are the things he can survive.	Saa nneɛma no na obetumi anya nkwa.
I don’t know why not but it’s not.	Minnim nea enti a ɛnte saa nanso ɛnte saa.
However, this right is about the case itself.	Nanso, saa hokwan yi fa asɛm no ankasa ho.
Who knows what.	Hena na onim nea.
Give him the best.	Fa nea eye sen biara ma no.
It would have been a good game, this would be.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ agoru pa, eyi bɛyɛ.
Until the night.	Kosi anadwo no mu.
He is a poor character.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔnyɛ papa.
Much much more than that.	Pii pii sen saa.
The quality is clearer and much better.	Su no mu da hɔ na eye sen saa kɛse.
In this moment, and the next, and the next.	Wɔ saa bere yi mu, ne nea edi hɔ no, ne nea edi hɔ no.
He is not a controller.	Ɔnyɛ obi a odi so.
But any type of bike will do that.	Nanso sakre ahorow biara bɛyɛ saa.
You and I both know this is not the case.	Me ne wo nyinaa nim sɛ eyi nte saa.
The man was very tall and strong.	Ná ɔbarima no tenten paa na ne ho yɛ den.
It seems simple enough.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
So have most of you.	Saa ara na mo mu dodow no ara nso ayɛ.
I always say that.	Meka saa bere nyinaa.
Many of its policies are extremely inefficient.	Ne nhyehyɛe ahorow no pii nyɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
But if you do, you’re in good hands.	Nanso sɛ woyɛ saa a, na wowɔ nsa pa mu.
I look after that a lot.	Mehwɛ ɛno akyi pii.
Consider three steps.	Susuw nneɛma abiɛsa a wɔyɛ no ho hwɛ.
So that was huge for me.	Enti na ɛno yɛ kɛse ma me.
She is young and beautiful.	Ɔyɛ abofra na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Or something like that.	Anaasɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
My kids used to go to school by bus.	Ná me mma de bɔs kɔ sukuu.
The issue should be put behind the scenes.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde asɛm no to akyi.
I know what it’s like.	Minim sɛnea ɛte.
That you were happy and doing well.	Sɛ na w’ani agye na woreyɛ yiye.
Your hair is still wet.	Wo ti nhwi da so ara yɛ nsu.
But don’t think everyone here is your equal.	Nanso nsusuw sɛ obiara a ɔwɔ ha no ne wo yɛ pɛ.
I still remember.	Meda so ara kae.
You can check that out here and here.	Wubetumi ahwɛ saa asɛm no wɔ ha ne ha.
It’s fast at this point.	Ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm wɔ saa bere yi mu.
Not that you disagree there.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ wo ne wo nyɛ adwene wɔ hɔ.
People were lying on the ground.	Ná nkurɔfo da fam.
It is important that the water is not too hot.	Ɛho hia sɛ nsu no nyɛ hyew dodo.
This will be a book for years to come.	Eyi bɛyɛ nhoma a wɔde bɛma mfe pii.
It almost looks the same.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
What works for you, works for you.	Nea ɛyɛ adwuma ma wo no, ɛyɛ adwuma ma wo.
Sleep whenever you can.	Da bere biara a wubetumi.
I wonder what they are made of.	Misusuw nea wɔde yɛ ho.
People need more friends, everyone needs more friends.	Nkurɔfo hia nnamfo pii, obiara hia nnamfo pii.
This is the first surprise.	Eyi ne ade a edi kan a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This room is empty.	Saa dan yi mu da hɔ kwa.
It’s not a problem.	Ɛnyɛ ɔhaw biara.
But one came out.	Nanso biako fii adi.
Very light and filling.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye na ɛyɛ ma.
There might not have been a single moment.	Ebia na bere biako mpo nni hɔ.
Just my name.	Me din kɛkɛ.
Scary.	Ɛyɛ hu.
The power is strong with this.	Tumi no mu yɛ den wɔ eyi ho.
I want to go with you.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kɔ.
I feel this.	Mete eyi nka.
He saw that, too.	Ɔno nso huu saa.
That’s the point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no.
Or some of the reasons why.	Anaasɛ nea enti a ɛte saa no bi.
I wanted money.	Ná mepɛ sika.
But he works for me.	Nanso ɔyɛ adwuma ma me.
Which is one of the bad things about our system.	Nea ɛyɛ nneɛma bɔne a ɛwɔ yɛn nhyehyɛe no mu biako.
I don’t want to do that.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
I forget his name.	Me werɛ afi ne din.
But they are inserted.	Nanso wɔde hyɛ mu.
He slipped his hands together.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ mu.
It’s him.	Ɛyɛ ɔno.
Anything was possible.	Ná biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye.
It kind of seemed to be.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ɔkwan bi so.
He slipped into her.	Ɔde ne ho bɔɔ no.
I look at the man.	Mehwɛ ɔbarima no.
I’ve always loved this.	M’ani gye eyi ho bere nyinaa.
What a great game with great music.	Hwɛ agoru kɛse a nnwom kɛse wom.
I thought he had done that.	Misusuwii sɛ wayɛ saa.
No one here would do that.	Obiara nni ha a ɔbɛyɛ saa.
Sounds good, but there are a couple of problems.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye, nanso ɔhaw abien bi wɔ hɔ.
He was never the same again.	Ná ɔnyɛ sɛnea na ɔte no bio da.
It happened a long time ago.	Esii bere tenten a atwam ni.
Will you join us?.	Wobɛka yɛn ho?.
I should have known they were friends.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛ wɔyɛ nnamfo.
I’m thinking of you.	M’adwene wɔ mo ho.
The room was full of beautiful people.	Ná nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ ahyɛ dan no mu ma.
Or even if he had one.	Anaasɛ sɛ na ɔwɔ bi mpo a.
I didn’t like him a bit.	Ná m’ani nnye ne ho kakra.
If you want to do that.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ saa a.
Tell us about that.	Ka saa asɛm no kyerɛ yɛn.
He would go home.	Ná ɔbɛkɔ fie.
And that’s what’s most important to me.	Na ɛno ne nea ɛho hia me sen biara.
Unless both are present, there is no test.	Gye sɛ nneɛma abien no nyinaa wɔ hɔ a, sɔhwɛ biara nni hɔ.
For me, no friends.	Me fam no, nnamfo biara nni hɔ.
We will only do the first case.	Yɛbɛyɛ asɛm a edi kan no nkutoo.
It seems a little strange.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra.
Everything around you is new.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ wo nkyɛn no yɛ ade foforo.
And yet, it really wasn’t that simple.	Na nanso, na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa ankasa.
Back to the issue at hand, though.	Nanso, san kɔ asɛm a ɛwɔ yɛn anim no so.
I know where he is the whole time.	Minim baabi a ɔwɔ bere no nyinaa.
Only one of them seemed happy.	Wɔn mu biako pɛ na na ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
Everyone believes.	Obiara gye di.
However, no story is perfect, and this one is not.	Nanso, asɛm biara nni hɔ a wɔka no yɛ nea edi mũ, na eyi nso nyɛ saa.
Nothing on this matter yet.	Biribiara nni asɛm yi ho de besi nnɛ.
The phone rang.	Telefon no bɔɔ.
As a result, none of them fared so well.	Ne saa nti, wɔn mu biara ankɔ yiye saa.
I look at him a bit puzzled.	Mehwɛ no a ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra.
This was not just one idea.	Ná eyi nyɛ adwene biako pɛ.
But he didn't want to do that.	Nanso na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Not that you have to believe this story.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wugye saa asɛm yi di.
We both saw what it was like.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa huu sɛnea na ɛte.
Forget the rest.	Wo werɛ mfi nea aka no.
It’s a really bad idea.	Ɛyɛ adwene bɔne ankasa.
So it's gone down a little bit.	Enti akɔ fam kakra.
I point to the bed.	Mede me nsa kyerɛ mpa no so.
It’s a temporary thing.	Ɛyɛ bere tiaa mu asɛm.
They all had their own.	Ná wɔn nyinaa wɔ wɔn ankasa de.
It is not the case today.	Ɛnte saa nnɛ.
Not the way most people think things are true.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea nnipa dodow no ara susuw nneɛma ho sɛ ɛyɛ nokware no.
He is not perfect.	Ɔnyɛ pɛ.
He tilted his head back.	Ɔde ne ti akyi.
He is doing so well.	Ɔreyɛ saa yiye.
But it’s my truth, it’s not.	Nanso ɛyɛ me nokware, ɛnte saa.
No way, no way.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ, ɔkwan biara so.
But there was something dangerous in his eyes.	Nanso na biribi a ɛyɛ hu wɔ n’ani so.
I think that’s a good thing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ ade pa.
This statement may be true.	Ebia saa asɛm yi yɛ nokware.
He was not a nice guy.	Ná ɔnyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
And good speech, too.	Na kasa pa nso.
Should be an exciting time!.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ anigye!.
It’s really just that.	Ɛte saa ara ankasa.
This is where it gets really interesting.	Eyi ne baabi a ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
I couldn’t quite introduce him to my real mother.	Na mintumi mfa no nkyerɛ me maame ankasa yiye.
Win the next game.	Di nkonim wɔ agoru a edi hɔ no mu.
Food is served all day long!	Wɔde aduan ma da mũ nyinaa!
Everything is as it should be.	Biribiara te sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
After a moment, he stepped forward.	Bere tiaa bi akyi no, ɔde ne nan sii anim.
First, an animal itself would cost more.	Nea edi kan no, na aboa ankasa bɛbɔ ka kɛse.
This is what he wanted.	Eyi ne nea na ɔpɛ.
The story is getting complicated.	Asɛm no reyɛ den.
Years of on-the-job experience.	Mfe pii a wɔde ayɛ adwuma wɔ adwumam.
And that’s not a bad thing.	Na ɛno nyɛ ade bɔne.
He has a lot to do.	Ɔwɔ pii a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
He’s a really nice guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa ankasa.
He lives nearby.	Ɔte bɛn no.
I found my truth.	Mihuu me nokware no.
The same ones, at that.	Wɔn koro no ara, wɔ saa bere no mu.
I was the next person.	Ná meyɛ onipa a odi hɔ.
This is the first one.	Eyi ne nea edi kan.
Or take him for a walk.	Anaasɛ fa no kɔ nantew.
I glanced out the front window.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ anim mfɛnsere no mu.
It’s just bad.	Ɛyɛ bɔne ara kwa.
And they enjoyed it.	Na wɔn ani gyee ho.
This problem seems very serious.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔhaw yi mu yɛ den yiye.
There is one left.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a aka biako.
Get out! 	Fi adi!
I didn’t mean to do it.	Na ɛnyɛ m’adwene ne sɛ mɛyɛ.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
And that was amazing.	Na ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
The idea hit him in the police car.	Adwene no bɔɔ no wɔ polisifo kar no mu.
All of that was very vague.	Ná ɛno nyinaa mu nna hɔ koraa.
That man is not in that room.	Saa ɔbarima no nni saa dan no mu.
But that’s really part of the story.	Nanso ɛno ka asɛm no ho ankasa.
But it was this picture that someone wanted.	Nanso ɛyɛ saa mfonini yi na na obi pɛ.
It’s still early today.	Ɛda so ara yɛ ntɛm de besi nnɛ.
I have to say mostly, it does.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ dodow no ara, ɛyɛ saa.
We hope to work our way down throughout the summer.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ yɛbɛyɛ adwuma akɔ fam wɔ awɔw bere no nyinaa mu.
I'm the other guy.	Me ne ɔbarima foforo no.
So the story goes on.	Enti asɛm no kɔ so.
Start planning now.	Fi ase yɛ nhyehyɛe mprempren.
I knew him well.	Ná minim no yiye.
The study of the	Adesua no
He is very strong.	Ɔyɛ den yiye.
The child is what matters.	Abofra no ne nea ɛho hia.
Most of them were from him.	Ná wɔn mu dodow no ara fi ne nkyɛn.
Here are some of the pictures.	Mfonini ahorow no bi ni.
Not my favorite, by any means.	Ɛnyɛ nea m’ani gye ho sen biara, ɔkwan biara so.
That’s just the way he is.	Saa ara ne sɛnea ɔte.
But he wanted to say one thing.	Nanso na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka asɛm biako.
It didn’t work, nothing worked.	Anyɛ adwuma, biribiara anyɛ adwuma.
It didn’t seem real.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ ade ankasa.
This was definitely a bad idea.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na eyi yɛ adwene bɔne.
People loved them, too.	Ná nkurɔfo ani gye wɔn ho, nso.
But his	Nanso ne de no .
That time was not like today.	Saa bere no nte sɛ nnɛ.
Or even contemplation.	Anaasɛ adwene a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho mpo.
There is really nothing new about this.	Biribi foforo biara nni eyi ho ankasa.
And he did so for a short time.	Na ɔyɛɛ saa bere tiaa bi.
He was here with us.	Na ɔne yɛn wɔ ha.
Besides, it will be a good time.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɛbɛyɛ bere pa.
It is and I thank you for doing it.	Ɛyɛ na meda wo ase sɛ woyɛ.
He stepped inside.	Ɔde ne nan sii mu.
This is not my bedroom.	Eyi nyɛ me mpa a meda mu.
I’m interested in things.	M’ani gye nneɛma ho.
Only you can save them.	Wo nkutoo na wubetumi agye wɔn nkwa.
Every day is a new day.	Da biara yɛ da foforo.
A terrible accident happened yesterday	Akwanhyia a ɛyɛ hu sii nnɛra
My son started school.	Me ba no fii sukuu ase.
He never discussed work in progress with anyone.	Ná ɔne obiara nsusuw adwuma a ɛrekɔ so ho da.
Don’t go for it.	Mfa ho nkɔ.
It’s just something that happened.	Ɛyɛ biribi a esii ara kwa.
It’s up to us.	Ɛwɔ yɛn so.
This was not the same thing.	Ná eyi nyɛ ade koro.
But the man took the gun anyway.	Nanso ɔbarima no faa tuo no ɔkwan biara so.
People tell me that.	Nkurɔfo ka saa kyerɛ me.
I had nothing to my name.	Ná minni hwee wɔ me din mu.
One thing was certain, though.	Nanso, na ade biako yɛ nokware.
It’s really amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
This is him, this is his big chance.	Eyi ne no, eyi ne ne hokwan kɛse no.
It was really beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
But we have to do that.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Not much, really.	Ɛnyɛ pii, ankasa.
He pointed at the dog.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ ɔkraman no so.
Maybe again.	Ebia bio.
But yesterday is all that matters.	Nanso nnɛra nkutoo ne nea ɛho hia.
There will be a last moment, a last chance.	Bere a etwa to bɛba, hokwan a etwa to.
You get it to work.	Wo nsa ka no ma ɛyɛ adwuma.
Determine which door to use.	Hwɛ ɔpon a wode bedi dwuma.
There are many good things.	Nneɛma pa pii wɔ hɔ.
It’s terribly good.	Ɛyɛ papa a ɛyɛ hu.
Just stay there.	Da hɔ ara kwa.
None of those things are.	Saa nneɛma no mu biara nte saa.
Apart from your time, there is no additional cost.	Sɛ wo bere no da nkyɛn a, ɛho ka foforo biara nni hɔ.
I’m going to	Meyɛ m’adwene sɛ .
Everyone.	Obiara.
I want to offer some help.	Mepɛ sɛ mede mmoa bi ma.
I can’t figure out the size.	Me ntumi nhu ne kɛse.
These are good things.	Eyi yɛ nneɛma pa.
He squinted at something.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ biribi so.
No surprise there, really.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa wɔ hɔ, ampa.
I thought about it immediately.	Misusuw ho ntɛm ara.
I couldn’t understand why no one did.	Na mintumi nte nea enti a obiara nyɛ saa no ase.
And he will go.	Na ɔbɛkɔ.
The atmosphere was tense throughout the meeting.	Ná tebea no mu yɛ den wɔ nhyiam no nyinaa mu.
In this case, knowing each other works.	Wɔ eyi mu no, sɛ obiara nim ne ho a, ɛyɛ adwuma.
Without a doubt, there is sin.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, bɔne wɔ hɔ.
Have a good night.	Momma mo ani nnye anadwo.
Even if the dog is not there.	Sɛ ɔkraman no nni hɔ mpo a.
But in a different angle.	Nanso wɔ anim foforo mu.
Draw closer to him.	Bɛn no kɛse.
Or should they be.	Anaasɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
It sounds like a fun game.	Ɛte sɛ agoru a ɛyɛ anigye.
Both may occur simultaneously.	Ebia nneɛma abien no nyinaa bɛkɔ so bere koro mu.
Everything about him was great.	Ná ne ho biribiara yɛ kɛse.
For many, this is a new concept.	Wɔ nnipa pii fam no, eyi yɛ adwene foforo.
That works much better.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma yiye kɛse.
Most of their work is done by hand.	Wɔde nsa na ɛyɛ wɔn adwuma dodow no ara.
And maybe it’s just an accident.	Na ebia ɛyɛ akwanhyia nkutoo.
You know, it was amazing.	Wunim, na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
In this he knew himself to be one.	Eyi mu no na onim ne ho sɛ ɔyɛ biako.
And you have a lot of support.	Na wowɔ mmoa kɛse.
I'm strong.	Meyɛ den.
Be careful, the floor is wet.	Hwɛ yiye, fam no ayɛ nsu.
It is, for now, complete.	Ɛyɛ, mprempren de, edi mũ.
I gave them the information.	Mede nsɛm no maa wɔn.
I could just about see him.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na metumi ahu no ara kwa.
In later years, he has little interest in acting.	Wɔ mfe a edi hɔ no mu no, n’ani nnye agoru ho kɛse.
He had brought enough trouble down for one day.	Ná ɔde ɔhaw a ɛdɔɔso aba fam da koro.
Thank you very much.	Meda mo ase paa.
It’s one of mine.	Ɛyɛ me de no mu biako.
They gave it to him.	Wɔde maa no.
You can believe whatever you want.	Wubetumi agye nea wopɛ biara adi.
He had a bad game.	Ná ɔwɔ agoru bɔne bi.
The full story is below.	Asɛm no nyinaa wɔ ase ha.
It’s all important.	Ne nyinaa ho hia.
Otherwise it is not.	Anyɛ saa a ɛnte saa.
It still looks good.	Ɛda so ara hwɛ yiye.
It was a beautiful moment.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ fɛ.
That overwhelms you after a while.	Ɛno hyɛ wo so bere tiaa bi akyi.
You told me to.	Woka kyerɛɛ me.
You are just in my way.	Wowɔ me kwan so ara kwa.
He glanced away, but thought it over.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ baabi foforo, nanso osusuw ho yiye.
Many happy years lay ahead.	Ná anigye mfe pii da wɔn anim.
Time was money, and people had a lot of work to do.	Ná bere yɛ sika, na na nkurɔfo wɔ adwuma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
At that point, there was nothing left.	Saa bere no, na biribiara nni hɔ a aka.
Last week, something truly awful happened.	Dapɛn a etwaam no, biribi a ɛyɛ hu ankasa sii.
I have to lie down again for a while.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda fam bio kakra.
There are many beautiful things to see here.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ pii wɔ ha a wubetumi ahu.
It may be a little bit.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ kakraa bi.
This was a job.	Ná eyi yɛ adwuma.
He liked that idea.	N’ani gyee saa adwene no ho.
Whatever you want.	Sɛnea wopɛ biara.
Check it out and tell us what you think!.	Hwɛ na ka nea wususuw kyerɛ yɛn!.
But in the end, the plan worked.	Nanso awiei koraa no, nhyehyɛe no yɛɛ adwuma.
And why, you might say.	Na nea enti a ɛte saa no, wubetumi aka sɛ.
I have a lot of things.	Mewɔ nneɛma pii.
I was feeling it.	Ná mete nka.
It was everything to me.	Ná ɛyɛ me biribiara.
I don't know what's wrong with it.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ bɔne wɔ ho.
He handed her the letter.	Ɔde krataa no maa no.
An innocently beautiful face.	Anim a ɛyɛ fɛ a ɛho nni asɛm.
That he can be whoever he wants to be.	Sɛ obetumi ayɛ obiara a ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
Don’t do this thing.	Mma wonyɛ saa ade yi.
This was a man, not a monster.	Ná ɔbarima bi ni, na ɛnyɛ aboa kɛse bi.
A beautiful thing!.	Ade a ɛyɛ fɛ!.
In other words, he liked her.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, na n’ani gye ne ho.
What it is and what it is.	Nea ɛyɛ ne nea ɛyɛ.
The school has a good reputation.	Sukuu no wɔ din pa.
One of us will do that.	Yɛn mu biako bɛyɛ saa.
So schedule your talk around this time.	Enti yɛ wo kasa ho nhyehyɛe bɛyɛ saa bere yi.
But that view is not important.	Nanso saa adwene no nyɛ nea ɛho hia.
He was very homesick.	Ná ɔpɛ ofie kɛse.
This house has saved my life.	Ofie yi agye me nkwa.
If that works out.	Sɛ ɛno yɛ adwuma a.
Enough for now.	Ɛdɔɔso ma mprempren yi.
He’s glad he has something to do.	N’ani gye sɛ ɔwɔ biribi yɛ.
Maybe it was the case.	Ebia na ɛte saa.
Every animal needs water.	Aboa biara hia nsu.
You want to be human.	Wopɛ sɛ woyɛ onipa.
Not too late for me, that is.	Ɛnyɛ akyiri dodo mma me, kyerɛ sɛ.
There must be a mistake.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mfomso bi wɔ hɔ.
I made it and took it to work, and everyone liked it.	Meyɛɛ no ​​na mede kɔɔ adwuma na obiara ani gyee ho.
He has two jobs.	Ɔwɔ nnwuma abien.
These buses are likely to arrive soon.	Ɛda adi sɛ bɔs ahorow yi bɛba nnansa yi ara.
It’s just the way it is.	Ɛyɛ sɛnea ɛte ara kwa.
And it wasn’t supposed to be.	Na na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
This will be a real test of what he can do.	Eyi bɛyɛ nea obetumi ayɛ ho sɔhwɛ ankasa.
Always, but what is this supposed to be.	Bere nyinaa, nanso dɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ.
It was a great book.	Ná ɛyɛ nhoma kɛse bi.
That is certainly true.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
He even had to do it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ mpo.
We can help!.	Yebetumi aboa!.
He knew only a few of their names.	Wɔn din kakraa bi pɛ na na onim.
I think about him every day.	Misusuw ne ho da biara da.
All the leads are here.	Nea edi anim nyinaa wɔ ha.
I was very surprised by the story.	Asɛm no yɛɛ me nwonwa yiye.
You can’t do both.	Worentumi nyɛ abien no nyinaa.
Essential.	Hia.
But he knows who did it.	Nanso onim nea ɔyɛɛ saa.
He would keep up with her.	Ná ɔbɛkɔ so ne no abɔ.
Neither of them seemed to like him.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔn mu biara ani nnye ne ho.
Look, don’t say anything.	Hwɛ, nka hwee.
But there really is no right or wrong.	Nanso papa anaa bɔne biara nni hɔ ankasa.
They are amazing.	Wɔyɛ nwonwa.
Thank you, anyway.	Meda wo ase, ɔkwan biara so.
No one does that.	Obiara nyɛ saa.
Probably more expensive.	Ebia ne bo yɛ den sen saa.
It’s not very pretty, but it works.	Ɛnyɛ fɛ yiye, nanso ɛyɛ adwuma.
He was anything but perfect.	Ná ɔyɛ biribiara gye sɛ ɔyɛ pɛ.
All his interests were gone.	Ná nea n’ani gye ho nyinaa afi hɔ.
I'm not sure why this is.	Me ntumi nhu nea enti a eyi te saa.
But we can’t do that and.	Nanso yɛrentumi nyɛ saa na.
Maybe it’s just a little bit.	Ebia ɛyɛ kakraa bi pɛ.
I can drive you there.	Metumi de wo kar akɔ hɔ.
Or at least they were.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, na wɔyɛ saa.
It’s not really a matter.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm ankasa.
But this last statement is false.	Nanso asɛm a etwa to yi yɛ atoro.
However, it is a sin.	Nanso, ɛyɛ bɔne.
So many years ago, we got very involved.	Enti mfe pii a atwam ni no, yɛde yɛn ho hyɛɛ mu kɛse.
He thought the matter through.	Osusuw asɛm no ho yiye.
You tell us about yourself.	Woka wo ho asɛm kyerɛ yɛn.
I tell you this.	Meka eyi kyerɛ mo.
However, this was not surprising.	Nanso, na eyi nyɛ nwonwa.
I don’t know at all.	Minnim koraa.
However, it works in a different way.	Nanso, ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
But it is only underwater.	Nanso ɛwɔ nsu ase nkutoo.
I am very sorry about it.	Ɛyɛ me yaw paa wɔ ho.
And it’s important.	Na ɛho hia.
There’s a lot going on inside.	Nneɛma pii rekɔ so wɔ mu.
They seemed to have no interest in the work.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani nnye adwuma no ho koraa.
But you seem to be doing everything.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea woreyɛ biribiara.
Once it’s hot, you can only start a small amount.	Sɛ ɛyɛ hyew a, wubetumi ahyɛ ase kakraa bi pɛ.
So he pretended to forget.	Enti ɔyɛɛ ne ho sɛ ne werɛ afi.
However, there are some issues here.	Nanso, nsɛm bi wɔ ha.
A thing to be used.	Ade a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma.
That happened many times.	Ɛno sii mpɛn pii.
It’s not really surprising.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
I can’t really imagine it.	Mintumi nsusuw ho ankasa.
I think this is an interesting idea.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ anigye.
She knew him well, somehow.	Ná onim no yiye, ɔkwan bi so no.
It was weak, but he understood.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw, nanso na ɔte ase.
He headed his way.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ne kwan so.
The latter is a bit more complicated.	Nea etwa to no yɛ nea ɛyɛ den kakra.
The same idea.	Adwene koro no ara.
The music calls my name.	Nnwom no bɔ me din.
Make yourself bigger.	Ma wo ho nyɛ kɛse.
But he might be interested.	Nanso ebia n’ani begye ho.
We were friends.	Ná yɛyɛ nnamfo.
I want to agree with him.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no yɛ adwene.
In the bedroom.	Wɔ mpa no mu.
They are very disappointed.	Wɔn abam abu kɛse.
It’s not that big of a deal.	Ɛnyɛ ade kɛse saa.
That’s the same situation here.	Ɛno ne tebea koro no ara wɔ ha.
I will definitely use this as it feels better.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mede eyi bedi dwuma sɛnea ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ yiye no.
Do this well.	Yɛ eyi yiye.
Who knows.	Hena na onim.
And that’s really the important thing to remember here.	Na ɛno ne ade a ɛho hia a ɛsɛ sɛ wokae wɔ ha ankasa.
But it had come at a price.	Nanso na aba wɔ bo bi mu.
You are full of surprises.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa ahyɛ wo ma.
However, that may come later.	Nanso, ebia ɛno bɛba akyiri yi.
He is the one who is there.	Ɔno ne obi a ɔwɔ hɔ.
I feel the same way.	Mete nka saa ara.
Run your hands through his hair.	Fa wo nsa tu mmirika fa ne ti nhwi so.
It was already work for them.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma dedaw ma wɔn.
You can’t do that now.	Worentumi nyɛ saa mprempren.
I’m not sure.	M’ani nnye ho.
And yet he didn’t even know her name.	Na nanso na onnim ne din mpo.
I want him, desperately.	Mepɛ no, denneennen.
I've done that.	Mayɛ saa.
You can’t get through that door!	Worentumi mfa saa ɔpon no mu!
I accept the past.	Migye nea atwam no tom.
Even for work.	Adwuma mpo nti.
It wasn’t too hot.	Ná ɛnyɛ hyew dodo.
He had a real soft spot for her.	Ná ɔwɔ baabi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa ma no.
We were almost .	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na yɛyɛ .
And this is not a good thing.	Na eyi nyɛ ade pa.
And it’s the same thing.	Na ɛte saa ara.
No one needs that kind of power.	Obiara nhia tumi a ɛte saa.
I don’t even want to.	Mempɛ mpo.
The first three days last only three days.	Nnansa a edi kan no di nnansa pɛ.
That can work too.	Ɛno nso betumi ayɛ adwuma.
He wants to take the bus.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde bɔs kɔ.
The next one will be interesting.	Nea odi hɔ no bɛyɛ anigye.
But this is not the whole picture.	Nanso ɛnyɛ eyi ne mfonini no nyinaa.
He is in the wrong way.	Ɔwɔ ɔkwan bɔne so.
I've got my eye on you tonight.	Mede m'ani asi wo so anadwo yi.
What a game that was.	Hwɛ agoru a na ɛno yɛ.
Something might actually happen tonight.	Ebia biribi bɛba ankasa anadwo yi.
All new or relatively new and very impressive.	Ne nyinaa yɛ foforo anaasɛ ɛyɛ foforo kakra na ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
There is no doubt that it will.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Rethink your plan.	San susuw wo nhyehyɛe no ho.
He could have had a gun.	Anka obetumi anya tuo.
This is a different version of the same story.	Eyi yɛ asɛm koro no ara a wɔka no ɔkwan foforo so.
Someone in the business gets involved.	Obi a ɔwɔ adwuma no mu de ne ho hyɛ mu.
I understood why.	Metee nea enti a ɛte saa no ase.
Or maybe it’s not.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
The meeting was adjourned.	Wɔde nhyiam no too nkyɛn.
That had already happened.	Ná ɛno aba dedaw.
They just do it.	Wɔyɛ ara kwa.
Behind the desk was a window.	Ná mfɛnsere bi wɔ pon no akyi.
One of the two will be used.	Wɔde abien no mu biako bedi dwuma.
There are a number of options.	Nneɛma ahorow bi wɔ hɔ a wɔde yɛ adwuma.
However, I was happy.	Nanso, na mewɔ anigye.
No one does that.	Obiara nyɛ saa.
It was a good thing he didn’t have.	Ná ɛyɛ ade pa a na onni.
Music is the product.	Nnwom ne ade a wɔyɛ.
That’s what one does.	Ɛno ne nea obi yɛ.
Her home was very nice.	Ná ne fie yɛ fɛ yiye.
And one last year.	Na biako afe a etwaam no.
This is nothing new.	Eyi nyɛ ade foforo.
That starts with me.	Ɛno fi ase wɔ me so.
Lots of things to forget.	Nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wo werɛ fi.
If you want more money.	Sɛ wopɛ sika pii a.
The extra time would be good for me.	Bere a wɔde bɛka ho no bɛyɛ papa ama me.
It’s under the table.	Ɛwɔ pon no ase.
Something beautiful and powerful is happening.	Biribi a ɛyɛ fɛ na tumi wom rekɔ so.
However, this is not entirely true.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
This is happening, for now.	Eyi rekɔ so, mprempren de.
I saw a lot of things.	Mihuu nneɛma pii.
As far as he could tell, the room was empty.	Sɛnea na obetumi ahu no, na hwee nni dan no mu.
The latter does not exist.	Nea etwa to no nni hɔ.
I no longer know whether that is true or not.	Minnim bio sɛ ​​ebia ɛno yɛ nokware anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
Everyone takes one and gives it away.	Obiara fa biako na ɔde ma.
I'm pretty good at that.	Me ho akokwaw wɔ saa asɛm no mu yiye.
He did not know when it would be done.	Ná onnim bere a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma no.
There is no such system.	Nhyehyɛe biara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
They take him forward, and in doing so, the case is dropped.	Wɔde no kɔ anim, na wɔyɛ saa no, wɔde asɛm no to nkyɛn.
The city is famous for its hot springs.	Kurow no agye din wɔ nsu a ɛyɛ hyew a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho.
It should be here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ ha.
This is a new house.	Eyi yɛ ofie foforo.
However, there was something he had to do first.	Nanso, na biribi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ odi kan yɛ wɔ ha.
I know you’ve enjoyed it.	Minim sɛ w’ani agye ho.
I saw us.	Mihuu yɛn.
I have become accustomed to them.	Mayɛ wɔn su.
Tomorrow is my day.	Ɔkyena yɛ me da.
I had a lot of things to do.	Ná mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
At least be honest about it.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, di nokware wɔ ho.
No one has control over it.	Obiara nni so tumi.
It’s absolutely essential.	Ɛho hia koraa.
I would have given anything to save him.	Anka mede biribiara bɛma na anka agye no nkwa.
But none of the plans are quite there yet.	Nanso nhyehyɛe ahorow no mu biara nni hɔ koraa de besi nnɛ.
You are working again.	Woreyɛ adwuma bio.
But he had better not.	Nanso na eye sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
Lots of money.	Sika pii.
I know these things.	Minim saa nneɛma yi.
But this is not always the case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na eyi te saa.
I saw my problem.	Mihuu me haw no.
She made most of our clothes.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ yɛn ntade dodow no ara.
It’s certainly not about the food itself.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ aduan no ankasa ho asɛm.
It wasn’t fun at the time.	Ɛnyɛ anigye saa bere no.
It’s a good day for walking.	Ɛyɛ da pa ma nantew.
This game lasts for hours.	Saa agoru yi di nnɔnhwerew pii.
You’ve been beautiful.	Woayɛ fɛ.
It’s really this simplicity.	Ɛyɛ saa a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yi ankasa.
He shook hands with another man.	Ɔne ɔbarima foforo bɔɔ ne nsa.
It wasn’t a big deal.	Ná ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse.
Tell us an interesting story.	Ka asɛm bi a ɛyɛ anigye kyerɛ yɛn.
The party started at midnight.	Apontow no fii ase anadwo fã.
He didn’t know what he was doing.	Na onnim nea ɔreyɛ.
I thought we could both go.	Misusuwii sɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa betumi akɔ.
They just handed me the phone.	Wɔde telefon no maa me ara kwa.
You don’t want the truth.	Wompɛ nokware no.
Such power does not exist at present.	Tumi a ɛte saa nni hɔ mprempren.
Seems strange for a house.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ma ofie bi.
It was not a happy home.	Ná ɛnyɛ ofie a anigye wom.
That had happened before.	Ná ɛno asi pɛn.
In time, he became stronger.	Bere kɔɔ so no, ne ho yɛɛ den.
But he knew that wasn't the only reason.	Nanso na onim sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo ne nea enti a ɔyɛ saa.
I just don’t understand.	Me nte ase kɛkɛ.
The same was true of me.	Saa ara na na ɛte wɔ me fam.
He's not the scary one here.	Ɛnyɛ ɔno ne nea ne ho yɛ hu no wɔ ha.
I just wanted to go to a movie.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ sini bi kɛkɛ.
It must have been expensive.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ne bo yɛ den.
It was that good.	Ná ɛyɛ papa saa.
I have to be someone like that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ obi a ɔte saa.
He didn't even want to think about it.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ osusuw ho mpo.
It just doesn’t look easy right now.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛkɛ mprempren.
Make your mistake here, not when it matters.	Yɛ wo mfomso wɔ ha, ɛnyɛ bere a ɛho hia no.
It was never like that.	Ná ɛnyɛ saa da.
It was very difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den yiye.
I have to do the same.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me nso meyɛ saa.
He was really hurting inside.	Ná ne mu reyɛ no yaw ankasa.
So this is definitely in the design of the car.	Enti akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi wɔ kar no nhyehyɛe no mu.
Do your homework by tomorrow night.	Yɛ wo fie nnwuma ansa na ɔkyena anadwo adu.
There is something else here.	Biribi foforo wɔ ha.
You can’t see it.	Worentumi nhu.
This gives a significant amount of power to your rifle.	Eyi ma tumi a ɛho hia kɛse wɔ wo tuo no mu.
Our minds race.	Yɛn adwene tu mmirika.
I don't know what's wrong with this.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ bɔne wɔ eyi ho.
I believe with you.	Me ne wo gye di.
Just like he does.	Sɛnea ɔyɛ no ara pɛ.
It didn’t seem like much.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ pii.
Likewise, there were a few truly amazing performances.	Saa ara nso na na agoru kakraa bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa wɔ hɔ.
These results are relatively new.	Nea afi mu aba yi yɛ foforo koraa.
I thought about that a lot.	Misusuw saa asɛm no ho pii.
It’s important to me.	Ɛho hia me.
As our book does.	Sɛnea yɛn nhoma no yɛ no.
Everything, every single thing, was wrong.	Na biribiara, ade biako biara, yɛ mfomso.
However, none of these things turned out to be the best.	Nanso, saa nneɛma yi mu biara antumi anyɛ nea eye sen biara.
Someone pretending to be someone else.	Obi a ɔreyɛ ne ho sɛ obi foforo.
I really, really did.	Meyɛɛ saa ampa, ampa.
He knew pictures.	Ná onim mfonini ahorow.
This is not the case.	Eyi nte saa.
Such is the case in the present case.	Tebea a ɛte saa te wɔ mprempren asɛm yi mu.
I felt terrible and tense all night.	Metee nka sɛ me ho yɛ hu kɛse na me ho yɛɛ me den anadwo mũ no nyinaa.
A problem escalated this past summer.	Ɔhaw bi mu yɛɛ den wɔ awɔw bere a atwam yi mu.
It’s just perfect now.	Ɛyɛ pɛ ara kwa mprempren.
They don’t like anything.	Wɔn ani nnye biribiara ho.
And money has come out of it.	Na sika nso afi mu.
And that takes precedence over everything else.	Na ɛno di kan sen biribiara a aka no.
But look how wrong one can be.	Nanso hwɛ sɛnea obi betumi adi mfomso.
It is completely wrong.	Ɛyɛ mfomso koraa.
Things will get better.	Nneɛma bɛkɔ yiye.
In the context.	Wɔ nsɛm no mu.
I just worked on this.	Meyɛɛ eyi ho adwuma ara kwa.
How beautiful it is!	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ fɛ!
A scary and heady time.	Bere a ɛyɛ hu na ɛyɛ ti.
I think he is here.	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ ha.
I can't get anything out of the thing.	Mintumi nnya biribiara mfi ade no mu.
As a child.	Sɛ́ abofra no.
And it was so.	Na ɛte saa.
However, that is what happened.	Nanso, ɛno ne nea esii.
I am new to this.	Meyɛ foforo wɔ eyi mu.
I know it was too fast.	Minim sɛ na ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
Innovation is not as lucrative as it used to be.	Nneɛma foforo a wɔyɛ no ntumi nnya sika pii te sɛ kan no.
Again, for hours.	Bio nso, nnɔnhwerew pii.
I talk to him a lot.	Me ne no kasa pii.
Years of free use.	Mfe pii a wɔde di dwuma kwa.
I had to keep living.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so tra ase.
The work is dangerous.	Adwuma no de asiane ba.
I’m going to be happy.	M’ani begye.
But it didn’t matter to them.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ hwee mma wɔn.
I was more than a little shocked.	Me ho dwiriw me sen kakra.
There is no more food.	Aduan biara nni hɔ bio.
Where is that located? 	Ɛhe na ɛno wɔ?
So they will focus on the team.	Enti wɔde wɔn adwene besi kuw no so.
That was all there was.	Ná ɛno nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I had a meeting to attend.	Ná mewɔ nhyiam bi a ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
They were recent.	Ná wɔyɛ nnansa yi ara.
The plan was implemented.	Wɔde nhyehyɛe no dii dwuma.
I could have done	Ná metumi ayɛ .
The kitten was too cute.	Ná ɔkraman ba no ho yɛ fɛ dodo.
And save the day.	Na gye da no nkwa.
Who knows why we are so late.	Hena na onim nea enti a yɛwɔ hɔ akyiri yi saa.
He shouldn’t have done this.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ eyi.
It was still out there.	Na ɛda so ara wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
For many it’s both.	Wɔ nnipa pii fam no ɛyɛ abien no nyinaa.
And they tell each other what they like about the other person.	Na wɔka nea wɔn ani gye ho wɔ onipa foforo no ho kyerɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
Make it work if you can.	Ma ɛnyɛ adwuma sɛ wubetumi a.
If there was a bad play to be made, it was made.	Sɛ agoru bɔne bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ a, na wɔyɛ.
Get your hands on them.	Fa wo nsa ka wɔn.
Many people don’t understand it very well.	Nnipa pii nte ase yiye.
But that would come later.	Nanso na ɛno bɛba akyiri yi.
This is his favorite song.	Eyi ne dwom a n’ani gye ho paa.
In the night.	Anadwo mu.
Start that project.	Fi saa adwuma no ase.
He was our father.	Ná ɔyɛ yɛn papa.
I expected that to be the case.	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɛte saa.
I want that for me.	Mepɛ saa ma me.
He put it on the table.	Ɔde too pon no so.
He was very good at it.	Ná ne ho akokwaw yiye wɔ mu.
This is a lie.	Eyi yɛ atoro.
Assume the first measurement.	Fa no sɛ nea edi kan a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho no.
Think about how you’ll do it.	Susuw sɛnea wobɛyɛ ho.
The police didn’t show up at all.	Polisifo no ankɔ hɔ koraa.
Maybe I was with him.	Ebia na me ne no wɔ hɔ.
It was a cold night.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo a awɔw wom.
No one knows how to do that.	Obiara nnim sɛnea wɔyɛ saa.
There are a number of things he brings.	Nneɛma ahorow bi wɔ hɔ a ɔde ba.
Just one more test.	Sɔhwɛ biako pɛ bio.
And it doesn’t work out the other way around.	Na ɛnyɛ yiye wɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
I really want to hear your thoughts.	Mepɛ sɛ mete mo adwene ankasa.
I have a new job.	Mewɔ adwuma foforo bi.
I was as shocked as anyone.	Me ho dwiriw me te sɛ obiara.
I can handle this, it’s just a project.	Metumi adi eyi ho dwuma, ɛyɛ adwuma bi kɛkɛ.
Often, there was no one available.	Mpɛn pii no, na obiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ adwuma.
He wants to paint.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ mfonini.
This room is very important, obviously.	Saa dan yi ho hia kɛse, ɛda adi sɛ.
I am so happy to see that people just love them.	M’ani gye kɛse sɛ mihu sɛ nkurɔfo ani gye wɔn ho ara kwa.
Many innovators make that mistake.	Nnipa pii a wɔyɛ nneɛma foforo no di saa mfomso no.
You want information.	Wopɛ nsɛm.
Each day a task will be set.	Da biara wɔde adwuma bi besi hɔ.
I hope you enjoy it.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho.
If you want to know more.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ wuhu pii a.
There are two possibilities.	Nsɛm abien betumi aba.
No one forgets their first time.	Obiara werɛ mfi wɔn bere a edi kan no.
Such a pleasure.	Anigye a ɛte saa.
And this is too important.	Na eyi ho hia dodo.
And here we are again.	Na ha na yɛwɔ bio.
Faults are common in new cars.	Mfomso abu so wɔ kar foforo mu.
Everyone looks.	Obiara hwɛ.
It was actually quite simple.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa ankasa.
I feel for them.	Mete wɔn nka.
He had no help or hope.	Ná onni mmoa anaa anidaso biara.
I headed into the room.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ dan no mu.
He is a quick study.	Ɔyɛ adesua a ɛyɛ ntɛm.
But this story is getting old.	Nanso saa asɛm yi reyɛ dedaw.
Everyone had told him.	Ná obiara aka akyerɛ no.
That was hard for our whole team.	Ná ɛno yɛ den ma yɛn kuw no nyinaa.
People have forgotten that.	Nkurɔfo werɛ afi saa asɛm no.
You need to know this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu eyi.
You can get used for a good price.	Wubetumi anya nea wɔde adi dwuma de agye bo pa.
He is in a terrible state.	Ɔwɔ tebea a ɛyɛ hu mu.
But he had a situation he felt he had to deal with.	Nanso na ɔwɔ tebea bi a ɔte nka sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ odi ho dwuma.
So this is what.	Enti eyi ne nea.
They are also human beings.	Wɔyɛ nnipa nso.
I can't really figure out what to do.	Mintumi nhu nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ankasa.
It hasn’t always gone so well.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na akɔ so yiye saa.
The way he is.	Sɛnea ɔte.
He could work with that.	Ná obetumi de saa ayɛ adwuma.
My mind was as clear and alive as it had ever been.	Ná m’adwene mu da hɔ na na ɛte ase sɛnea na ɛte saa da.
That hurt a little bit.	Ɛno maa metee yaw kakra.
But it is not true.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nokware.
But they are both lying.	Nanso wɔn baanu nyinaa di atoro.
One of the two indeed.	Nnipa baanu no mu biako ampa.
It is immersed in water.	Wɔde ahyɛ nsu mu.
Now many people use it.	Seesei nnipa pii de di dwuma.
They spoke fondly of their children.	Wɔde anigye kaa wɔn mma ho asɛm.
He doesn’t do anything about it.	Ɔnyɛ ho biribi.
You can find more here.	Wubetumi ahu pii wɔ ha.
People have to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo kɔ.
It’s quick and easy to do.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm na ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ.
They also used each other.	Wɔde wɔn ho wɔn ho nso dii dwuma.
It was just him.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔno nkutoo.
Everything has gone well.	Biribiara akɔ yiye.
That time has long passed.	Saa bere no atwam akyɛ.
There’s a lot more danger here.	Asiane pii wɔ ha kɛse.
A good part of that.	Ɛno fã pa bi.
Promise them whatever you want.	Fa nea wopɛ biara hyɛ wɔn bɔ.
Describe your product just a little bit.	Ka wo nneɛma no ho asɛm kakraa bi pɛ.
We were at this point for about a year.	Ná yɛwɔ saa bere yi mu bɛyɛ afe biako.
I am there now.	Mewɔ hɔ seesei.
Everything is true.	Asɛm biara yɛ nokware.
If there was nothing, there was everything to be done.	Sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a, na biribiara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I understand why you need to do this.	Mete nea enti a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi no ase.
He had done so.	Ná wayɛ saa.
I can't see it, either.	Mintumi nhu, nso.
It didn't even look real.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa mpo.
But it was the same.	Nanso na ɛte saa ara.
I watch him play a little bit.	Mehwɛ sɛnea ɔbɔ no kakra.
Everything was working fine.	Ná biribiara reyɛ adwuma yiye.
This is not a new story.	Eyi nyɛ asɛm foforo.
We hold one meeting each month.	Yɛyɛ nhyiam biako ɔsram biara.
Many years have passed since then.	Mfe pii atwam fi saa bere no.
I put him on the bed.	Mede no too mpa so.
But that didn’t happen.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na esii.
I don't know why he's bothered.	Me nnim nea enti a ɔhaw no.
Otherwise, he had nothing.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, na onni hwee.
You need to get to know them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu wɔn.
I want it to work well.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
I could barely function.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nyɛ adwuma.
You could have given him time.	Anka wubetumi ama no bere.
He knew no one could hear him.	Ná onim sɛ obiara ntumi nte no.
We will focus on this issue from now on.	Yɛde yɛn adwene besi asɛm yi so fi saa bere yi rekɔ.
A little scary, but good kid.	Ɛyɛ hu kakra, nanso abofra pa.
He's really fun to be around.	Ɔyɛ anigye ankasa sɛ wobɛka ne ho.
We’re all really on the same team.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ kuw koro mu ankasa.
We had to do this every summer.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ eyi awɔw bere biara.
A car starts.	Kar bi fi ase.
This was terrible.	Ná eyi yɛ hu.
Everything is new and up to date.	Biribiara yɛ foforo na ɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ nnɛ.
So you’ve done it right.	Enti woayɛ no yiye.
That hair is hot.	Saa ti nhwi no yɛ hyew.
But he is in trouble.	Nanso ɔwɔ ɔhaw mu.
This is a big problem for me.	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw kɛse ma me.
So there’s not a lot of thinking going on.	Enti adwene pii nni hɔ a ɛrekɔ so.
Things were still not easy.	Ná nneɛma da so ara nyɛ mmerɛw.
The hard part our new way.	Nea ɛyɛ den no yɛn kwan foforo no.
That letter never reached him.	Saa krataa no ankɔ ne nkyɛn da.
I knew it was just a matter of time.	Ná minim sɛ ɛyɛ bere ho asɛm ara kwa.
I have to thank him for that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda no ase wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
A couple of things.	Nneɛma abien bi.
True or not.	Ɛyɛ nokware anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
I wanted to know what they were made of.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu nea wɔde yɛ.
Few people all go one way or the other.	Nnipa kakraa bi na wɔn nyinaa fa ɔkwan biako so anaa ɔkwan foforo so.
Like, really, really.	Te sɛ, nea ɛyɛ ankasa, ankasa.
I'm so sorry for you.	Mepa wo kyɛw paa.
Maybe that day will come.	Ebia saa da no bɛba.
Don’t tell anyone.	Nka nkyerɛ obiara.
When you see it.	Bere a wuhu no.
A very difficult thing.	Ade a ɛyɛ den yiye.
Not close, with the team.	Ɛnyɛ bɛn, ne kuw no.
I know it’s late.	Minim sɛ aka akyi.
You have the right to be happy.	Wowɔ hokwan sɛ w'ani gye.
Can you come right away?	So wubetumi aba ntɛm ara?
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
My hands were almost numb.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na me nsa ayɛ mmerɛw.
Deal with me.	Di me ho dwuma.
There will be a lot of traffic accidents this month.	Kar akwanhyia pii bɛba ɔsram yi.
If it was good, forget it.	Sɛ na eye a, ma wo werɛ mfi.
I knew exactly what I had to do.	Ná minim nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ no yiye.
Over the next several days.	Wɔ nna dodow bi a edi hɔ no mu.
It’s the problem.	Ɛyɛ ɔhaw no.
I have no rights.	Minni hokwan biara.
But it looks fantastic.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Our next date will be next week.	Yɛn da a edi hɔ no bɛyɛ dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
But it would be more dangerous.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ nea asiane wom kɛse.
You can’t save everyone you see.	Worentumi nnye obiara a wuhu no nkwa.
A lot of time has passed!	Bere pii atwam!
You can do anything, there.	Wubetumi ayɛ biribiara, wɔ hɔ.
Not everyone can do it.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na obetumi.
You are an animal.	Woyɛ aboa.
This is a similar case.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛte saa ara.
But it is more important than that.	Nanso ɛho hia sen saa.
This cannot continue.	Eyi ntumi nkɔ so.
I have been amazed at the support.	Mmoa a wɔde ma me no ayɛ me nwonwa.
Things are a way.	Nneɛma yɛ ɔkwan bi so.
Is he with his friends?	So ɔne ne nnamfo?
It doesn’t have to be complicated.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ den.
It was a dangerous job.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma a asiane wom.
I'm working with you.	Me ne wo yɛ adwuma.
It’s amazing things he creates.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɔbɔ.
What's new.	Nea ɛyɛ foforo.
The film touches on many important issues.	Sini no ka nsɛm pii a ɛho hia ho asɛm.
It hurts both of them.	Ɛyɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa yaw.
But it never felt like work.	Nanso na nte nka sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma da.
I think that’s it.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne no.
Things get really weird, really fast.	Nneɛma yɛ nwonwa ankasa, ntɛmntɛm ankasa.
I still forget about it today.	Meda so ara werɛ fi ho nnɛ.
I need money.	Sika ho hia me.
It's on for my dog.	Ɛwɔ so ma me kraman.
He seems to have done so.	Ɛte sɛ nea wayɛ saa.
He had no friends.	Ná onni nnamfo biara.
Maybe the door is open.	Ebia na ɔpon no mu da hɔ.
She styled her hair.	Ɔde ne ti nhwi yɛɛ fɛ.
That would be good.	Ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
That is not really true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware ankasa.
He felt it too.	Ɔno nso tee nka.
It is an important book.	Ɛyɛ nhoma a ɛho hia.
He could handle it.	Ná obetumi adi ho dwuma.
I think about it more than anyone else can.	Misusuw ho kɛse sen sɛ obi foforo biara ntumi nyɛ saa.
There was never enough money.	Na sika a ɛdɔɔso nni hɔ da.
His other passion is music.	Ade foforo a n’ani gye ho ne nnwom.
So, okay, a final thought.	Enti, ɛyɛ, adwene a etwa to.
Naturally, dinner was just beginning.	Sɛnea ɛte no, na anwummere aduan afi ase ara kwa.
It’s very, very difficult.	Ɛyɛ den yiye, yiye.
It’s really quite amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa ankasa.
Day, day, day.	Da, da, da.
Eat immediately, warm.	Di ntɛm ara, yɛ hyew.
Are these sessions expensive?	So saa nhyiam ahorow yi bo yɛ den?
So, everything works fine.	Enti, biribiara yɛ adwuma yiye.
I am a real man.	Meyɛ ɔbarima ankasa.
Not just in words.	Ɛnyɛ nsɛm mu kɛkɛ.
It was just as well for him that most people didn’t believe it.	Na ɛyɛ papa saa ara ma no sɛ nnipa dodow no ara nnye nni.
I hope that is true.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
A police car follows them.	Polisifo kar bi di wɔn akyi.
You do a great job.	Woyɛ adwuma kɛse.
Make the most of the time.	Fa bere no di dwuma yiye.
It must be someone else.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ obi foforo.
Eventually he himself.	Awiei koraa no ɔno ara.
Many people have this problem.	Nnipa pii wɔ ɔhaw yi.
And he wasn’t the only one.	Na ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo.
It’s just the timing.	Ɛyɛ bere a wɔde hyɛ mu no ara.
But he was in a different state when this happened.	Nanso na ɔwɔ tebea foforo mu bere a eyi sii no.
At least that first time.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa bere a edi kan no.
It feels really authentic.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware ankasa.
The joy of performing live.	Anigye a ɛwɔ agoru a wɔyɛ no tee mu.
She knew and he knew she knew.	Ná onim na na onim sɛ ɔno nso nim.
No one could find me there.	Obiara antumi anhu me wɔ hɔ.
Eventually, matters came to a head.	Awiei koraa no, nsɛm baa ɔhaw mu.
There is such a danger here.	Asiane a ɛte saa wɔ ha.
It was too powerful.	Ná tumi wom dodo.
That may sound easy, but it’s not.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw, nanso ɛnte saa.
He says that humans are nothing but animals.	Ɔka sɛ nnipa nyɛ hwee sɛ mmoa.
Here's more about the project.	Adwuma no ho nsɛm pii ni.
We all want to do it.	Yɛn nyinaa pɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
He nodded to the group.	Ɔde ne ti too kuw no so.
His wife was also surprised.	Na ɛyɛ ne yere nso nwonwa.
It was just a place to see.	Ná ɛyɛ baabi a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu ara kwa.
No one really does that.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ saa ankasa.
I found this here.	Mihuu eyi wɔ ha.
I’m just happy to be here.	M’ani agye ara kwa sɛ mewɔ ha.
However, it is still in testing.	Nanso, ɛda so ara wɔ sɔhwɛ mu.
We have to use everything that is available.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde biribiara a ɛwɔ hɔ no di dwuma.
I might have done something else.	Ebia na mayɛ biribi foforo.
So he signed it off.	Enti ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ ase.
The next week was awful.	Ná dapɛn a edi hɔ no yɛ hu.
This arrangement can cause serious problems.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi betumi de ɔhaw kɛse aba.
Put someone by every window.	Fa obi to mfɛnsere biara ho.
It’s hard to say one thing.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka asɛm biako.
Without me, there’s something wrong with this picture.	Sɛ me nni hɔ a, biribi bɔne wɔ saa mfonini yi ho.
Plan ahead.	Di kan yɛ nhyehyɛe.
He was a painter.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ mfonini.
I was very busy.	Ná minni adagyew koraa.
All these things are told to us personally.	Wɔka saa nneɛma yi nyinaa kyerɛ yɛn ankasa.
And if something can happen, that’s fine.	Na sɛ biribi betumi asi a, ɛyɛ papa.
I really wanted to prove myself.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meda me ho adi ankasa.
And they were a little interested.	Na na wɔn ani gye ho kakra.
That’s one part of it.	Ɛno ne ne fã biako.
That’s a problem, but a good one.	Ɛno yɛ ɔhaw, nanso ɛyɛ ɔhaw pa.
The meeting began.	Nhyiam no fii ase.
Wear long-sleeved shirts.	Hyɛ ntade a wɔde hyɛ ntade a nsa tenten wom.
It was his home.	Ná ɛyɛ ne fie.
But our time is up.	Nanso yɛn bere atwam.
Either way can work.	Ɔkwan biara so betumi ayɛ adwuma.
There is obviously a lot here to work with.	Ɛda adi sɛ nneɛma pii wɔ ha a ɛsɛ sɛ wode yɛ adwuma.
He touched the book.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa nhoma no.
And their faces, too.	Na wɔn anim nso.
These past few years have been very difficult.	Mfe kakraa a atwam yi ayɛ den yiye.
I have more and better.	Mewɔ pii ne papa.
The door was easy.	Ná ɔpon no yɛ mmerɛw.
It’s just the truth.	Ɛyɛ nokware no ara kwa.
They don’t like him either.	Wɔn nso wɔn ani nnye n’ani.
I don't know how I can help.	Minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ no betumi aboa.
Consider what that means.	Susuw nea ɛno kyerɛ ho hwɛ.
Or at least pictures of them.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔn mfonini ahorow.
People still talk about the food.	Nkurɔfo da so ara ka aduan no ho asɛm.
It was an old habit.	Ná ɛyɛ su dedaw bi.
You may even be bitten by a snake.	Ebia ɔwɔ bɛka wo mpo.
Otherwise he's doing just fine.	Anyɛ saa a ɔreyɛ yiye ara kwa.
This is not entirely true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
All you have to do is agree with me, for now.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ara ne sɛ wo ne me bɛyɛ adwene, mprempren.
You can only use any date on that date.	Wubetumi de da biara a ɛwɔ saa da no nkutoo adi dwuma.
That is the case now.	Ɛte saa mprempren.
We can talk about that.	Yebetumi aka saa asɛm no ho asɛm.
I felt terrible all night.	Metee nka sɛ me ho yɛ hu anadwo mũ no nyinaa.
He’s terrible.	Ɔyɛ hu.
I don't care what you think.	Nea wususuw ho no mfa me ho.
He had stuff on his head.	Ná wɔde nneɛma ahyɛ ne ti so.
With little excitement, perhaps.	Bere a anigye kakraa bi na ɛwɔ mu no, ebia.
We are the good guys.	Yɛn na yɛyɛ nnipa pa no.
Nobody’s children.	Obiara mma.
His house is a simple matter.	Ne fie yɛ asɛm a ɛnyɛ den.
I nodded my head.	Mede me ti too fam.
The end would come soon.	Ná awiei no bɛba nnansa yi ara.
He'll tell you a little bit about it in a song.	Ɔbɛka ho asɛm kakra akyerɛ wo wɔ dwom bi mu.
You can’t make up the point.	Worentumi nyɛ asɛm no so.
I didn’t really know what to tell him.	Na minnim nea mɛka akyerɛ no ankasa.
I thought maybe there was an accident or something.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia akwanhyia bi anaa biribi asi.
Man, time is up.	Onipa, bere tu.
But you don’t have to.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
This does not usually have to be true.	Mpɛn pii no, enhia sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
We work on it.	Yɛyɛ ho adwuma.
This may be an easy game.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ agoru a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
The gun is really pretty.	Tuo no yɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
I need to feel him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete ne nka.
It is an exciting time for us now.	Ɛyɛ anigye bere ma yɛn mprempren.
I would say this.	Anka mɛka eyi.
You need to see him and his children.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no ne ne mma.
I believe they do.	Migye di sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
There is nothing we can do at this point.	Biribiara nni hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ wɔ saa bere yi mu.
Thank you so much.	Meda pii.
This would have been the main room.	Anka eyi bɛyɛ dan kɛse no.
It’s an artificial situation.	Ɛyɛ tebea a wɔde nsa ayɛ.
The boy stared at me.	Abarimaa no hwɛɛ me denneennen.
And not just any book.	Na ɛnyɛ nhoma biara kɛkɛ.
Get back to life.	San kɔ nkwa mu.
But that seems to be happening here.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛno rekɔ so wɔ ha.
He’s just your type, you know.	Ɔyɛ wo su kɛkɛ, wunim.
This method is difficult for him to describe.	Ɔkwan yi yɛ den ma no sɛ ɔbɛka ho asɛm.
The more you work, the more money.	Dodow a woyɛ adwuma no, dodow no ara na sika pii.
Reapply as needed.	San fa di dwuma sɛnea ɛho hia.
I saw a lot of things.	Mihuu nneɛma pii.
I don’t, of course.	Menyɛ saa, ampa.
That wasn’t wise.	Ná ɛno nyɛ nyansa.
Do what you say sorry.	Yɛ nea wobɛka sɛ kyɛw.
Everyone wants him.	Obiara pɛ no.
However, it is not.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ saa.
He was hot stuff.	Ná ɔyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ hyew.
I can make this as simple or complex as possible.	Metumi ama eyi ayɛ mmerɛw anaasɛ ɛyɛ den sɛnea metumi biara.
He had the right to do so.	Ná ɔwɔ hokwan sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Probably good in bed, too.	Ebia eye wɔ mpa so, nso.
That’s what his intentions were.	Ɛno ne nea na n’adwene yɛ no.
There are no varieties.	Nneɛma ahorow biara nni hɔ.
It would have been better.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
Sounds good to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye ma me.
I was pretty convinced of it.	Ná migye di yiye wɔ ho.
The whole day goes on.	Da mũ no nyinaa kɔ so.
Nothing really exists.	Biribiara nni hɔ ankasa.
Two more will follow.	Nnipa baanu foforo nso bedi akyi.
Those were new days for me.	Ná ɛno yɛ nna foforo ma me.
He wasn’t interested in money.	Ná n’ani nnye sika ho.
I have a dog that sleeps with me every night.	Mewɔ ɔkraman bi a ɔne me da anadwo biara.
I had worked for him for two years.	Ná mayɛ adwuma ama no mfe abien ni.
I have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
It doesn’t surprise us.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn nwonwa.
And the gun, too.	Na tuo no nso.
Besides, you are not one of us anyway.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, wonyɛ yɛn mu biako ɔkwan biara so.
Take your time though.	Gye wo bere nanso.
He had forgotten everything.	Ná ne werɛ afi biribiara.
He was brought home.	Wɔde no baa fie.
She is a great mother.	Ɔyɛ maame kɛse.
Look at the good stuff.	Hwɛ nneɛma pa no.
That’s an interesting name.	Ɛno yɛ din a ɛyɛ anigye.
The room is full of clothes.	Ntade ahyɛ dan no mu ma.
I don't need this.	Me nhia eyi.
Just a few times really.	Mpɛn kakraa bi pɛ ankasa.
I don’t know about myself either.	Minnim me ho asɛm nso.
I can tell you that right now.	Metumi aka saa asɛm no akyerɛ wo mprempren ara.
There is no one left.	Obiara nni hɔ a aka.
He’s right there.	Ɔwɔ hɔ ara.
But there was this new house that only looked older.	Nanso na ofie foforo yi wɔ hɔ a na ɛte sɛ nea akyɛ nkutoo.
But it wasn’t the same thing.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ade koro.
The man shook his head.	Ɔbarima no bɔɔ ne ti.
These first two things were true.	Ná nneɛma abien a edi kan yi yɛ nokware.
I shouldn’t be doing this.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi.
The language is very clear.	Kasa no mu da hɔ yiye.
Now bringing them in book form.	Seesei de wɔn aba nhoma kwan so.
I can’t imagine that’s a good thing.	Mintumi nsusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ ade pa.
This is important from the perspective of the story.	Eyi ho hia wɔ asɛm no ho adwene mu.
No human being can.	Onipa biara nni hɔ a obetumi.
Maybe someone worse.	Ebia obi a ɔyɛ bɔne sen saa.
They make many of the things we use every day.	Wɔyɛ nneɛma a yɛde di dwuma da biara no pii.
The time has come.	Bere no adu.
I can’t do that with him.	Me ne no ntumi nyɛ saa.
They look great every time.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye bere biara.
Any chance for tonight.	Hokwan biara a ɛwɔ hɔ ma anadwo yi.
He touched her hand.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa no.
If you have one, remove it.	Sɛ wowɔ bi a, yi.
This is pretty great.	Eyi yɛ kɛse yiye.
I don’t know where it is.	Minnim baabi a ɛwɔ.
But it is no longer the case.	Nanso ɛnte saa bio.
He enjoyed the game.	N’ani gyee agoru no ho.
He tiptoed into the room.	Ɔde ne nan ase kɔɔ dan no mu.
I was surprised by the simplicity of the food.	Sɛnea aduan no yɛ mmerɛw no maa me ho dwiriw me.
No children playing outside.	Mmofra biara nni agoru wɔ abɔnten.
The week before was.	Na dapɛn a edi ɛno anim no yɛ.
We had a lot on target.	Ná yɛwɔ pii a yɛde asi yɛn ani so.
Those things.	Saa nneɛma no.
It’s absolutely amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
He had never known a girlfriend.	Ná onnim abeawa bi a ɔne obi te da.
I don’t get anything.	Me nnya hwee.
None of them believe it.	Wɔn mu biara nnye nni.
He seemed to be like that.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔte saa.
As with my books, the characters are often animals as well.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ me nhoma ahorow ho no, nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no taa yɛ mmoa nso.
So our words.	So yɛn nsɛm no.
I am good at a few things, and terrible at many.	Me ho akokwaw wɔ nneɛma kakraa bi mu, na me ho yɛ hu wɔ pii mu.
I hope you know that.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wunim saa.
If so, it’s a good idea.	Sɛ saa a, ɛyɛ adwene pa.
In the picture it might look nice, but it’s not.	Wɔ mfonini no mu no ebia ɛbɛyɛ fɛ, nanso ɛnte saa.
No one knows where you are.	Obiara nnim baabi a wowɔ.
I don’t know why, but he is.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa, nanso ɔte saa.
My kids love it.	Me mma ani gye ho.
Money, for one thing.	Sika, ade biako nti.
Her mother was in her room.	Ná ne maame wɔ ne dan mu.
Which it will, it will.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ, ɛbɛyɛ.
A few surprises along the way.	Nneɛma kakraa bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ kwan no so.
He would say what he felt was true.	Ná ɔbɛka nea ɔte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
We have it in us.	Yɛwɔ bi wɔ yɛn mu.
It was a very cold night.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo a awɔw wom paa.
His speech was slurred.	Ná ne kasa no yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
My hair is too short for that quality.	Me ti nhwi yɛ tiaa dodo ma saa su no.
I want to reflect this in my home.	Mepɛ sɛ meda eyi adi wɔ me fie.
He knows he could do it.	Onim sɛ na obetumi ayɛ.
He gave me his name.	Ɔde ne din too me.
If we can find them.	Sɛ yebetumi anya wɔn a.
I should have put that excitement on hold for two days.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mede saa anigye no to nkyɛn nna abien.
You can’t go anywhere else.	Worentumi nkɔ baabi foforo biara.
Besides, my name is on the case.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, me din wɔ asɛm no so.
We do the work immediately.	Yɛyɛ adwuma no ntɛm ara.
The dog did the same.	Ɔkraman no nso yɛɛ saa ara.
Everyone who may have known him is long gone.	Obiara a ebia na onim no nni hɔ akyɛ.
Try to do that.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
It’s never really easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw ankasa da.
A little too complicated.	Kakra a ɛyɛ den dodo.
The problem is, you don’t.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ, wonyɛ saa.
I just use it for good.	Mede di dwuma ma papa ara kwa.
They’re both gone.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa akɔ.
Take me away.	Fa me kɔ.
This doesn’t surprise me one bit.	Eyi nyɛ me nwonwa kakra.
That happened a lot back then.	Ɛno sii pii saa bere no.
For more information, age.	Sɛ wopɛ nsɛm pii a, mfe a obi adi.
That’s not much at all.	Ɛno nyɛ pii koraa.
They may be the single weakest link in the system.	Ebia wɔyɛ ade biako pɛ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sen biara wɔ nhyehyɛe no mu.
We have given a complete story.	Yɛde asɛm a edi mũ ama.
It’s just so good.	Ɛyɛ papa ara kwa.
We like to be us.	Yɛn ani gye ho sɛ yɛbɛyɛ yɛn.
This did not go well either.	Eyi nso ankɔ so yiye.
This is not a good job.	Eyi nyɛ adwuma pa.
How cold it is outside.	Hwɛ sɛnea awɔw wom wɔ abɔnten.
I saw that here somewhere.	Mihuu saa wɔ ha wɔ baabi.
Which isn’t really you.	Nea ɛnyɛ wo ankasa.
There is no one for them.	Obiara nni hɔ mma wɔn.
Just what matters.	Nea ɛho hia ara kwa.
Please, man.	Mesrɛ wo, onipa.
Look at the big picture.	Hwɛ mfonini kɛse no.
They are very beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Claims may be multilevel.	Ebia nsɛm a wɔka no bɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ nsɛm pii mu.
But nothing worked out.	Nanso biribiara anyɛ yiye.
We weren’t the only ones.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn nkutoo na na yɛyɛ saa.
You have to put it first.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode di kan.
I really do that.	Meyɛ saa ankasa.
That is a wonderful statement.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It was the same thing.	Ná ɛte saa ara.
He had never done that before.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa da.
The plan was unpopular, but it didn't matter.	Ná nhyehyɛe no nyɛ nea nkurɔfo ani nnye ho, nanso na ɛnyɛ hwee.
Think about it very carefully.	Susuw ho yiye paa.
People still talk about that now.	Nkurɔfo da so ara ka saa asɛm no ho asɛm mprempren.
I did indeed do that.	Meyɛɛ saa ampa.
The next week, there was another.	Dapɛn a edi hɔ no, na foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
We had that idea.	Ná yɛwɔ saa adwene no.
Time is hard.	Bere yɛ den.
This is just another story.	Eyi yɛ asɛm foforo ara kwa.
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
Below, the children play.	Wɔ ase hɔ no, mmofra no di agoru.
But it’s hard, very hard.	Nanso ɛyɛ den, ɛyɛ den yiye.
That’s the only real issue here.	Ɛno nkutoo ne asɛm ankasa a ɛwɔ ha.
I don't know if it works.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛyɛ adwuma anaa.
It was a pleasant day, but very cold.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye, nanso na awɔw wom kɛse.
I have a song.	Mewɔ dwom bi.
I love how you used the picture.	M’ani gye sɛnea wode mfonini no dii dwuma no ho.
No one should know.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara nim.
And it was us.	Na ɛyɛ yɛn.
I expected good for the price.	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɛbɛyɛ papa wɔ bo no ho.
This sounds good.	Eyi te sɛ nea eye.
It was not our favorite part of the day.	Ná ɛnyɛ da no fã a yɛn ani gye ho paa.
He would do anything.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ biribiara.
But the stories are nothing new to me.	Nanso nsɛm no nyɛ ade foforo mma me.
One like the next.	Biako te sɛ nea edi hɔ no.
Just have fun and work a little.	Gye w’ani kɛkɛ na yɛ adwuma kakra.
It’s really something.	Ɛyɛ biribi ankasa.
It is absolutely true.	Ɛyɛ nokware a edi mũ.
But he shouldn’t have done something I didn’t know.	Nanso anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ade a minnim.
That means you can trust both.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ wubetumi agye abien no nyinaa adi.
Who is the other one.	Hena ne foforo no.
We need to make a statement.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ asɛm bi.
My mom and dad.	Me maame ne me papa.
Not on the phone.	Ɛnyɛ telefon so.
This city has a big problem.	Saa kurow yi wɔ ɔhaw kɛse bi.
But many people use it that way.	Nanso nnipa pii de di dwuma saa kwan no so.
The phone was still ringing.	Ná telefon no da so ara bɔ.
And they’re fast, too.	Na wɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm, nso.
Make it what you want.	Yɛ no nea wopɛ.
Diversity of animals is very common here.	Mmoa ahorow ahorow abu so kɛse wɔ ha.
Yesterday that meeting took place.	Nnɛra saa nhyiam no kɔɔ so.
He had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Suppose something happened.	Fa no sɛ biribi sii.
His room is at the end.	Ne dan no wɔ awiei.
This is the most important point.	Eyi ne asɛm a ɛho hia sen biara.
I had about two hours of sleep in me.	Na me a meda bɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abien wɔ me mu.
I worked quickly.	Meyɛɛ adwuma ntɛmntɛm.
Probably just like everything else here.	Ebia ɛte sɛ biribiara a aka wɔ ha no ara pɛ.
He put his shoes on the table.	Ɔde ne mpaboa too pon no so.
He wants to work on his own.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa yɛ adwuma.
Maybe it was outside in the house.	Ebia na ɛwɔ abɔnten wɔ fie hɔ.
We are interested in you.	Yɛn ani gye wo ho.
He was an independent thinker.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔde ne ho susuw nneɛma ho.
I could have seen it years ago.	Anka metumi ahu no mfe bi a atwam ni.
You can help too.	Wo nso wubetumi aboa.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na ɛte saa.
And you are as strong as each other.	Na mo ho yɛ den te sɛ mo ho mo ho.
As you all have done.	Sɛnea mo nyinaa ayɛ.
With a few friends.	Ɔne ne nnamfo kakraa bi.
I want to make a play.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ agoru bi.
And he gave it to you.	Na ɔde maa wo.
We have so much time.	Yɛwɔ bere pii saa.
Add most of the water.	Fa nsu no fã kɛse no ara ka ho.
Can you help ?.	So wubetumi aboa ?.
First in literature.	Nea edi kan wɔ nhoma ahorow mu.
I really need to take care of myself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ me ho ankasa.
Be sure to use high-quality paper.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wode krataa a ɛyɛ papa bedi dwuma.
They are very beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
A girl almost as fragile as he had been with her.	Abeawa bi a ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ nea na ɔne no wɔ no.
You can see that in the pictures.	Wubetumi ahu saa wɔ mfonini ahorow no mu.
He had something.	Ná ɔwɔ biribi.
And that worked.	Na ɛno yɛɛ adwuma.
Despite this, we spent more time together than we had.	Eyi nyinaa akyi no, yɛde bere pii bɔɔ mu sen sɛnea na yɛwɔ.
I thought you knew it was better.	Misusuwii sɛ wunim sɛ eye sen saa.
Both genres have been very popular.	Nnwom ahorow abien no nyinaa agye din kɛse.
To make the dog more comfortable.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɔkraman no ho bɛtɔ no kɛse.
But dinner tonight is no big deal.	Nanso anwummere aduan anadwo yi nyɛ ade kɛse.
His hand went to me.	Ne nsa kɔɔ me nkyɛn.
He brought them outside.	Ɔde wɔn baa abɔnten.
He spoke a language he didn’t know.	Ná ɔka kasa bi a onnim.
But he liked it, naturally.	Nanso n’ani gyee ho, sɛnea ɛte no.
Be careful with this.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ eyi ho.
You would never be able to do that.	Anka worentumi nyɛ saa da.
Or there is something.	Anaasɛ biribi wɔ hɔ.
In the case of water, however, the situation is far less clear.	Nanso, wɔ nsu ho no, tebea no mu nna hɔ koraa.
Finally, something happened.	Awiei koraa no, biribi too mu.
In the short term, at least.	Wɔ bere tiaa mu no, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
It’s in my nature.	Ɛwɔ me su mu.
Everyone just kept having fun.	Obiara kɔɔ so gyee n’ani ara kwa.
You have one year.	Wowɔ afe biako.
It’s full of stuff.	Nneɛma ahyɛ mu ma.
It is the power of hope.	Ɛyɛ anidaso tumi.
One other thing, though.	Nanso, ade foforo biako nso.
Just keep painting.	Kɔ so yɛ mfonini kɛkɛ.
His mother was worried.	Ná ne maame haw.
Nor is he licensed to do any other work.	Saa ara nso na onni tumi krataa sɛ ɔnyɛ adwuma foforo biara.
So watch what you say!	Enti hwɛ nea woka!
So that’s not the problem here.	Enti ɛnyɛ ɛno ne ɔhaw a ɛwɔ ha.
Making something out of nothing.	Biribi a wobɛyɛ afi biribiara mu.
Good movie but not great.	Sini pa nanso ɛnyɛ kɛse.
I do the same thing.	Me nso meyɛ saa ara.
I would have done the same.	Anka me nso mɛyɛ saa.
He meant a number of things by this.	Ná ɔde eyi kyerɛ nneɛma dodow bi.
I guess it didn’t matter who or why.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛnyɛ hwee sɛ hena anaa nea enti a ɔyɛ saa.
Everyone was still busy with the clothes.	Ná obiara da so ara nni adagyew wɔ ntade no ho.
It’s not just one thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade biako pɛ.
If you like us, great.	Sɛ w’ani gye yɛn ho a, ɛyɛ kɛse.
He brought you here.	Ɔde wo baa ha.
I knew it hurt.	Ná minim sɛ ɛyɛ yaw.
People see that.	Nkurɔfo hu saa.
But you can’t do that.	Nanso worentumi nyɛ saa.
I couldn’t help myself.	Na mintumi mmoa me ho.
Don't go too far.	Nkɔ akyiri nkɔ akyiri.
I definitely have to check it out.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ.
A little after school, right?	Sukuu akyi kakra, ɛnte saa?
I can’t find anywhere else.	Me ntumi nhu baabi foforo.
We can accept that.	Yebetumi agye saa asɛm no.
Do you know where this was?	Wunim baabi a na eyi wɔ?
My only hope is that it is not too difficult for him.	Anidaso biako pɛ a mewɔ ne sɛ ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den dodo mma no.
We all have one.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ biako.
There were many factors involved.	Ná nneɛma pii na ɛwɔ asɛm no mu.
And that’s what we were there for.	Na ɛno ne nea na yɛwɔ hɔ ma.
That’s what had happened.	Saa na na asi.
It becomes the setting of the film he is here to make.	Ɛbɛyɛ sini a ɔwɔ ha sɛ ɔbɛyɛ no tebea.
This is your problem.	Eyi ne wo haw.
I love everything about him.	M’ani gye ne ho biribiara ho.
So there is nothing else.	Enti biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
Everything that is real is real about the present moment.	Biribiara a ɛyɛ nokware no yɛ nokware wɔ mprempren bere yi ho.
Books were always important.	Ná nhoma ho hia bere nyinaa.
I understand why though.	Mete nea enti a ɛte saa no ase nanso.
On our feet.	Yɛn nan so.
You have to stay here with us.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne yɛn tra ha.
Mind is not even part of it.	Adwene nyɛ ne fã mpo.
It was partly my fault.	Ná ɛyɛ me mfomso fã bi.
They have been told what to do for years.	Wɔde mfe pii akyerɛ wɔn nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Everything is just like the pictures.	Biribiara te sɛ mfonini ahorow no ara pɛ.
I didn’t really have a clue.	Ná minni ho hwee ankasa.
You know this is true.	Wunim sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
It works extremely well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
This is the last one.	Eyi ne nea etwa to.
He didn’t have money either.	Ná onni sika nso.
He has been with this group for many years.	Ɔne kuw yi abɔ mfe pii ni.
He seemed too young.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ abofra dodo.
The housework was pretty easy.	Ná ofie nnwuma no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
I have forgotten myself.	Me werɛ afi me ho.
It is easy and quick.	Ɛnyɛ den na wɔyɛ no ntɛmntɛm.
You know the name.	Wunim din no.
He was not popular.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho.
I love this room.	M’ani gye dan yi ho.
To somehow make it better.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɔkwan bi so no bɛma ayɛ yiye.
The danger was great.	Ná asiane no yɛ kɛse.
This used to work well.	Kan no na eyi yɛ adwuma yiye.
It was great to see him.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye kɛse sɛ mihuu no.
No one had ever believed him.	Ná obiara nnye no nni da.
I wanted to see the whole thing.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu ade no nyinaa.
This sounds more complicated than it is.	Eyi te sɛ nea ɛyɛ den sen sɛnea ɛte.
This is very easy and inexpensive.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye na ne bo nyɛ den.
Maybe it’s as simple as that.	Ebia ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ ɛno.
Remember it used to be beautiful.	Kae sɛ kan no na ɛyɛ fɛ.
It has meant a lot to me.	Akyerɛ pii ama me.
It should harden in about three hours.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den wɔ bɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa mu.
I really enjoyed the story and the characters.	M’ani gyee asɛm no ne nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no ho paa.
A child should be able to see that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ abofra tumi hu saa.
He just knows.	Onim ara kwa.
The bus needs to turn out of that direction.	Ɛsɛ sɛ bɔs no dan ne ho fi saa kwan no so.
He certainly seemed familiar.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛte sɛ nea onim no yiye.
It is perfect in every way.	Ɛyɛ pɛ wɔ biribiara mu.
It looks great, should do well with the years to come.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yiye ne mfe a edi hɔ no.
I really wanted to be a part of something.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi fã ankasa.
And where does that music come from?	Na ɛhe na saa nnwom no fi?
We all start somewhere.	Yɛn nyinaa fi ase wɔ baabi.
Every day has passed.	Da biara da atwam.
People love animals.	Nkurɔfo ani gye mmoa ho.
I hoped it wasn’t me.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ me.
He wanted to be jealous.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ n’ani bere.
Absolutely amazing stuff.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
For me, it was.	Wɔ me fam no, na ɛte saa.
New, every month or so.	Foforo, ɔsram biara anaa nea ɛte saa.
I spent most of my day doing this thing, yesterday.	Mede me da no fã kɛse no ara yɛɛ saa ade yi, nnɛra.
Promise it will be quick.	Hyɛ bɔ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ ntɛm.
You are as quick as they are.	Woyɛ ntɛm te sɛ wɔn.
Which will be good.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ papa.
But that didn’t do any good either.	Nanso ɛno nso anyɛ papa biara.
It just feels good for you to say it over and over again.	Ɛyɛ te sɛ nea eye ma wo ara kwa sɛ wobɛka no mpɛn pii.
The power of both.	Tumi a ɛwɔ baanu nyinaa.
He added another space to his meeting.	Ɔde baabi foforo kaa ne nhyiam no ho.
I want to do something.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi.
But it didn’t matter.	Nanso anyɛ hwee.
I had a hard time with it.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma me wɔ ho.
It was very bad.	Ná ɛyɛ bɔne paa.
It’s important, too!	Ɛho hia nso!
I always did that.	Ná meyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
You can upload your photos if you wish.	Wubetumi de wo mfonini ahorow ahyɛ mu sɛ wopɛ a.
Maybe he’s not that bad.	Ebia ɔnyɛ bɔne saa.
This road is in a terrible state.	Saa kwan yi wɔ tebea a ɛyɛ hu mu.
He doesn’t have sex with anyone else.	Ɔne obi foforo biara nna.
We were in a hurry.	Ná yɛyɛ ntɛm.
So tell me the truth.	Enti ka nokware kyerɛ me.
There is nothing to be done.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Someone who knows him, more or less.	Obi a onim no, kɛse anaa kakraa bi.
The problem is acute here in the city.	Ɔhaw no mu yɛ den wɔ kurow no mu ha.
That in itself is difficult.	Ɛno ankasa yɛ den.
There was nothing left on the table.	Ná hwee nni pon no so bio.
As much as it pains me to say this.	Sɛnea ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ mɛka eyi no.
He had no money on him.	Ná onni sika biara wɔ ne so.
He could have done that in his sleep.	Anka obetumi ayɛ saa wɔ ne nna mu.
But it was still awesome.	Nanso na ɛda so ara yɛ hu.
His song ends.	Ne dwom no ba awiei.
That’s my opinion.	Ɛno ne m’adwene.
But at the end of the day, that’s the man.	Nanso ɛda no awiei no, ɛno ne ɔbarima no.
He was easily popular.	Ná ɛnyɛ den koraa sɛ nkurɔfo ani begye ne ho.
He liked how beautiful she was.	N’ani gyee sɛnea na ɔyɛ fɛ no ho.
I wanted to make sure he understood.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ hu sɛ ɔte ase.
Can anyone help please???.	Obi betumi aboa mesrɛ wo???.
But it seemed to be true.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
You don’t have to tell me.	Ɛho nhia sɛ woka kyerɛ me.
I'm sorry it's cold.	Mepa wo kyɛw sɛ awɔw wom.
None of these things are true.	Saa nneɛma yi mu biara nyɛ nokware.
He didn't know if that was still true or not.	Ná onnim sɛ ebia ɛno da so ara yɛ nokware anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
It was a truly amazing moment.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
But it’s not any good.	Nanso ɛnyɛ papa biara.
Not just now.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren ara kwa.
Tell your friends.	Ka kyerɛ wo nnamfo.
Deal with them.	Di wɔn ho dwuma.
You’ve done that.	Woayɛ saa.
He did the experimental work.	Ɔyɛɛ sɔhwɛ adwuma no.
I spent the whole morning.	Mede anɔpa mũ no nyinaa yɛɛ adwuma.
Somewhere else entirely.	Baabi foforo koraa.
He has a wide variety of interests.	Ɔwɔ nneɛma ahorow pii a n’ani gye ho.
He touched her hand in his.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne nsa wɔ ne de mu.
I don't have to be on the road much.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ ɔkwan no so kɛse.
This is really hard for me.	Eyi yɛ den ma me ankasa.
Tell me what you did today.	Ka nea woayɛ nnɛ no kyerɛ me.
It would have been much easier.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
It has been working for a long time.	Ayɛ adwuma bere tenten ni.
Neither of us spoke for a moment.	Yɛn mu biara ankasa bere tiaa bi.
Success is not about happiness.	Odi mu nyɛ anigye ho asɛm.
I guess you could put it that way.	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi de ahyɛ mu saa.
This was an exciting day.	Ná eyi yɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye.
I told him the same thing.	Me nso meka kyerɛɛ no ​​saa.
Maybe a long time ago.	Ebia bere tenten a atwam ni.
He nodded reluctantly.	Ɔde ne ti too fam a na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Something strange is going on there.	Biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa rekɔ so wɔ hɔ.
This is true even when you need to know better.	Eyi te saa mpo bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu yiye no.
It was really great.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse ankasa.
But it’s not just any job.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma biara kɛkɛ.
I liked his attitude.	M’ani gyee ne su no ho.
To me, she was beautiful.	Wɔ me fam no, na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Many of them do.	Wɔn mu pii yɛ saa.
And in great numbers.	Na wɔ dodow kɛse mu.
Not much fun going on around here.	Ɛnyɛ anigye pii a ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha ho.
It’s the simplest.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sen biara.
But dinner doesn’t seem to think of itself as dinner.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea anwummere aduan nsusuw ne ho sɛ anwummere aduan.
We have that same thing.	Yɛwɔ saa ade koro no ara.
It will be very, very difficult.	Ɛbɛyɛ den yiye paa.
I discuss this in more detail below.	Meka eyi ho asɛm kɔ akyiri wɔ ase ha.
It was terrible.	Ná ɛyɛ hu.
Her hair is thick, but beautiful.	Ne ti nhwi yɛ den, nanso ɛyɛ fɛ.
And they might just end it tonight.	Na ebia wɔde bɛba awiei anadwo yi ara kwa.
We had all done our part.	Ná yɛn nyinaa ayɛ yɛn fam de.
It’s the same face as last time.	Ɛyɛ anim koro no ara a na ɛte bere a etwaam no.
You probably know him.	Ebia wunim no.
A squirrel scratched at his head, causing him to crash to the ground.	Ɔkraman bi de ne ho bɔɔ ne ti, na ɔde ne ho bɔɔ fam denneennen.
It has to be you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo.
His first morning of practice.	Ne anɔpa a edi kan a ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
It will be a lot of fun.	Ɛbɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
But that’s behind us.	Nanso ɛno na ɛwɔ yɛn akyi.
Just feels amazing.	Te nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
That is a mistake.	Ɛno yɛ mfomso.
But he was too good for her.	Nanso na ɔyɛ papa dodo ma no.
Who is this person?	Hena ne onipa yi?
She seems so beautiful and attractive.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ fɛ na ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I still do a little bit to this day.	Meda so ara yɛ kakra de besi nnɛ.
We have enough of our own.	Yɛwɔ yɛn ankasa de a ɛdɔɔso.
There was nothing to give.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde ma.
I just have to be good.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ papa ara kwa.
I wasn’t there.	Ná minni hɔ.
I want you to do it.	Mepɛ sɛ woyɛ.
This is just a wonderful story.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
It’s not just the kids.	Ɛnyɛ mmofra no nkutoo.
The kitten latched onto my leg.	Ɔkraman ba no de ne nsa bɔɔ me nan so.
He didn’t know her.	Ná onnim no.
I know he was like that.	Minim sɛ na ɔte saa.
It’s just my opinion.	Ɛyɛ m’adwene ara kwa.
There is no way my luck could be that good.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ a m’ani gye betumi ayɛ papa saa.
He is the brightest boy in class.	Ɔno ne abarimaa a ne ho akokwaw sen biara wɔ adesua mu.
However, this seemed pretty close.	Nanso, na ɛte sɛ nea eyi bɛn saa koraa.
But only if you want to.	Nanso sɛ wopɛ nkutoo a.
Look at yourself from the outside.	Hwɛ wo ho fi abɔnten.
He would have loved to have been here today.	Anka n’ani begye ho sɛ anka ɔwɔ ha nnɛ.
I want to hear all you can tell me.	Mepɛ sɛ mete nea wubetumi aka akyerɛ me nyinaa.
A terrible mistake.	Mfomso a ɛyɛ hu.
Walk down a bridge.	Nantew fa abɔnten so kwan bi so.
See how he handles money.	Hwɛ sɛnea odi sika ho dwuma.
I’m not like you.	Me nte sɛ wo.
In this case, the.	Wɔ eyi mu no.
This evening, he will be joined by his wife.	Anwummere yi, ne yere bɛka ne ho.
It was difficult at the time.	Ná ɛyɛ den saa bere no.
There are no job opportunities here at all.	Adwuma hokwan ahorow nni ha koraa.
Another mistake happened.	Mfomso foforo nso sii.
I really liked that letter.	M’ani gyee saa krataa no ho ankasa.
The party was definitely over.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na apontow no aba awiei.
I think this paper looks good.	Misusuw sɛ krataa yi hwɛ yiye.
Not nearly enough.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
But.	Nanso.
The work is going well.	Adwuma no rekɔ so yiye.
They are sophisticated and complex.	Wɔyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa na ɛyɛ den.
Even so, too soon.	Ɛno mpo no, ntɛm dodo.
It was always more difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den kɛse bere nyinaa.
And often it is.	Na mpɛn pii no, ɛte saa.
Keep your feet on the ground.	Ma wo nan nkɔ fam.
And his life, too.	Na ne nkwa nso.
I have to go, you said.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ, wokae.
His music will make you happy.	Ne nnwom bɛma w’ani agye.
All three would have been ideal.	Anka abiɛsa no nyinaa bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
Those two things are very important.	Saa nneɛma abien no ho hia kɛse.
You’re very interested in me.	W’ani gye me ho kɛse.
We could go somewhere else.	Ná yebetumi akɔ baabi foforo.
Water is essential for human life.	Nsu ho hia ma onipa nkwa.
That’s a good thing.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm pa.
This time, he had better do it right.	Saa bere yi de, na eye sɛ ɔbɛyɛ no yiye.
You have a situation here.	Wowɔ tebea bi wɔ ha.
Within a month.	Wɔ ɔsram biako mu.
Now it is very easy.	Mprempren ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
But now things are dangerous.	Nanso seesei nneɛma ayɛ asiane.
The picture is not calibration.	Mfonini no nyɛ nea wɔde susuw nneɛma ho.
We have children.	Yɛwɔ mma.
But in this case it didn’t matter.	Nanso wɔ eyi mu no na ɛnyɛ hwee.
He established a new one.	Ɔde foforo sii hɔ.
I thought about the house.	Misusuw ofie no ho.
This is our only job.	Eyi nkutoo ne yɛn adwuma.
I loved the movie.	Ná m’ani gye sini no ho.
It didn't matter if he looked familiar.	Sɛ na ɔte sɛ nea onim no yiye a, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
Did you know it exists.	So wunim sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
And as he knew.	Na sɛnea na onim no.
I want him back with us.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔne yɛn san ba.
And maybe that’s part of the problem?.	Na ebia ɛno yɛ ɔhaw no fã?.
It would be great if someone could help.	Sɛ obi betumi aboa a, anka ɛbɛyɛ papa.
However, it is difficult to do many things well.	Nanso, ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ nneɛma pii yiye.
But it never happened.	Nanso amma da.
He showed it to her.	Ɔde kyerɛɛ no.
A man was sleeping this way.	Ná ɔbarima bi da saa kwan yi so.
He’s a boy who loves this city.	Ɔyɛ abarimaa a n’ani gye kurow yi ho.
I really hope you did well.	Mewɔ anidaso ankasa sɛ woayɛ no yiye.
I can’t get ahead of myself.	Mintumi nni me ho anim.
Do this, don’t do that.	Yɛ eyi, nyɛ saa.
I only have time to talk about this.	Mewɔ bere a mede bɛka eyi ho asɛm nkutoo.
Anything else, my hair was thin.	Biribiara foforo biara, na me ti nhwi yɛ mmerɛw.
I want nothing to do with this crazy.	Mempɛ sɛ me ne saa kraman yi nni hwee yɛ.
A return to the status quo.	A san kɔ tebea a ɛwɔ hɔ no mu.
Everyone says this should never happen again.	Obiara ka sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi ba bio.
He is within range now.	Ɔwɔ baabi a obetumi akɔ mprempren.
That’s them, in the picture.	Ɛno ne wɔn, wɔ mfonini no mu.
It’s that big of a deal.	Ɛyɛ kɛse saa.
Check out what they do.	Hwɛ nea wɔyɛ.
It wasn’t human.	Ná ɛnyɛ onipa de.
He wanted her.	Ná ɔpɛ no.
Get back to me.	San kɔ me so.
It was a critical moment.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛho hia.
Take good care of their clothes.	Hwɛ wɔn ntade so yiye.
I should have looked after me.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ me yiye.
He was in no danger.	Ná onni asiane biara mu.
But we like it that way.	Nanso yɛn ani gye ho saa.
He’s seen it too.	Ɔno nso ahu.
That’s certainly important, but it’s not enough.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno ho hia, nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
Finally very soon.	Awiei koraa no ntɛm koraa.
His film career was an immediate success.	Ne sini adwuma no dii yiye ntɛm ara.
People want the real thing.	Nkurɔfo pɛ ade ankasa no.
It seemed to be a long time ago.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea akyɛ.
After that, things get complicated.	Ɛno akyi no, nneɛma mu yɛ den.
But that is a lie.	Nanso ɛno yɛ atoro.
But this is even more important today.	Nanso eyi ho hia kɛse mpo nnɛ.
You, and my son.	Wo, ne me ba no.
What is the right thing to do?	Dɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ?
This is a story of hope for each of us.	Eyi yɛ anidaso ho asɛm ma yɛn mu biara.
It was always the same when a gentleman.	Bere nyinaa na ɛte saa ara bere a ɔbarima bi a ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne mfe akɔ anim no.
But there was no time.	Nanso na bere nni hɔ.
It was even better.	Ná eye sen saa mpo.
If at all possible, live below your means.	Sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye koraa a, tra ase wɔ wo sika ase.
This was definitely not going according to plan.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na eyi nkɔ sɛnea nhyehyɛe te.
This can have many ingredients.	Eyi betumi anya nneɛma pii a wɔde yɛ aduan.
We have to do all the work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma no nyinaa.
His speech was still slurred.	Ná ne kasa no da so ara yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
The timing always looks bad.	Bere no hwɛ bɔne bere nyinaa.
Some of these things are difficult.	Saa nneɛma yi bi yɛ den.
Someone had said his name.	Ná obi aka ne din.
The dress is too short.	Atade no yɛ tiaa dodo.
It wasn’t something he liked.	Ná ɛnyɛ biribi a n’ani gye ho.
They are beautiful.	Wɔyɛ fɛ.
Believe it and that’s what we use every day.	Gye di na ɛno ne nea yɛde di dwuma da biara da.
At the time, he didn’t care.	Saa bere no, na ɛnyɛ no asɛm.
What was it like.	Ná ɛyɛ dɛn.
I hope you all have a great week.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo nyinaa anya dapɛn kɛse bi.
And you can see it too.	Na wo nso wubetumi ahu.
But this time, he was in control.	Nanso saa bere yi de, na odi tumi.
It was too hard for him.	Ná ɛyɛ den dodo ma no.
He's looking amazing.	Ɔreyɛ ayɛ nwonwa.
I didn’t want to know.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu.
At least a few of them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔn mu kakraa bi.
Something else to work on.	Biribi foforo a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho adwuma.
I have a new plan for you.	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe foforo ma wo.
However, there will be other things.	Nanso, nneɛma foforo bi bɛba.
Looks like his chance has finally come.	Ɛte sɛ nea awiei koraa no ne hokwan no aba.
This language or that one.	Saa kasa yi anaa saa biako no.
Your name.	Wo din.
He could see her again and again.	Ná obetumi ahu no mpɛn pii.
Besides, nothing was the same as last year.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, na biribiara nni hɔ a na ɛte afe a etwaam no.
Not everyone is so lucky.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na ɔwɔ anigye saa.
It’s as bad as anything.	Ɛyɛ bɔne te sɛ nea ɛte biara.
He looks just like that guy.	Ɔte sɛ saa ɔbarima no ara pɛ.
I’m so excited for you.	M’ani gye wo ho paa.
However, our story is true.	Nanso, yɛn asɛm no yɛ nokware.
Everyone talked about him.	Obiara kaa ne ho asɛm.
This will be very difficult.	Eyi bɛyɛ den yiye.
He doesn’t have to use them.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɔde wɔn di dwuma.
That is not good at all.	Ɛno nyɛ papa koraa.
See me tonight.	Hwɛ me anadwo yi.
How do you know if you’re happy?	Wobɛyɛ dɛn ahu sɛ w’ani agye?
He was involved himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa de ne ho ahyɛ mu.
It was a lot of fun.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye pii.
I had definitely missed him.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na me werɛ fii no.
He has a few friends.	Ɔwɔ nnamfo kakraa bi.
It’s this way of being.	Ɛyɛ saa kwan yi so.
But they also do that.	Nanso wɔyɛ saa nso.
However, it still has some problems.	Nanso, ɛda so ara wɔ ɔhaw ahorow bi.
Waterproof clothing is waterproof clothing.	Ntade a nsu ntumi nkɔ mu yɛ ntade a nsu ntumi nkɔ mu.
And so it will surely be.	Na saa ara nso bɛba ampa.
My father will join us this afternoon.	Me papa bɛka yɛn ho awia yi.
It had started right away in one.	Ná afi ase ntɛm ara wɔ biako mu.
The day started well	Da no fii ase yiye
You can get a lot of solid information from here.	Wubetumi anya nsɛm a ɛyɛ den pii afi ha.
Sleep throughout the day.	Da da mũ no nyinaa.
He is a great dominant man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse a odi tumi.
Time, as he well knew, was short.	Bere, sɛnea na onim yiye no, yɛ tiaa.
And neither can any of you.	Na mo mu biara nso ntumi nyɛ saa.
Once again, it is not entirely true.	Saa bere yi nso, ɛnyɛ nokware koraa.
My legs were pounding.	Ná me nan rebɔ.
It was still the same thing.	Ná ɛda so ara yɛ ade koro no ara.
Return the information immediately.	Fa nsɛm no san ba ntɛm ara.
It will be so.	Ɛbɛyɛ saa.
However, the picture quality is very poor.	Nanso, mfonini no su nyɛ papa koraa.
We now have two new models.	Seesei yɛwɔ mfonini foforo abien.
The music was breathtaking.	Ná nnwom no yɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This process continued.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi kɔɔ so.
This made my day.	Eyi maa me da no yɛɛ kɛse.
There was little left.	Ná aka kakraa bi na aka.
I just liked that as an idea.	M’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho ara kwa sɛ adwene bi.
At the same time they were inexpensive.	Bere koro no ara mu no na wɔn bo nyɛ den.
This city is growing every year.	Kurow yi reyɛ kɛse afe biara.
These statements are wrong in many cases.	Saa nsɛm yi yɛ mfomso wɔ nsɛm pii mu.
It’s been a pleasure.	Ayɛ anigye.
But it does exist.	Nanso ɛwɔ hɔ.
Use one mindset.	Fa adwene biako di dwuma.
There was also a problem.	Na ɔhaw bi nso wɔ hɔ.
You have been working on them for a long time.	Woayɛ wɔn ho adwuma bere tenten ni.
Anything could be out there.	Biribiara betumi ayɛ nea ɛwɔ abɔnten hɔ.
Put your trust in him.	Fa wo ho to no so.
It was quite simple.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
He spent most of the day in bed.	Ɔde da no fã kɛse no ara traa mpa so.
Do any of you know	So mo mu biara nim .
Good morning to you all.	Anɔpa pa ma mo nyinaa.
That’s too bad.	Ɛno yɛ bɔne dodo.
I feel it.	Mete nka.
A boy or a girl?	Abarimaa anaa abeawa?
It only becomes fashionable in recent years.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea aba so wɔ nnansa yi mfe mu nkutoo.
It was just an accident.	Ná ɛyɛ akwanhyia ara kwa.
Take it home ahead of us.	Fa kɔ fie di yɛn anim.
This is not really true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware ankasa.
It was just words.	Ná ɛyɛ nsɛm nkutoo.
Maybe he was human after all.	Ebia na ɔyɛ onipa wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
If you want a little more.	Sɛ wopɛ kakra a.
It’s a good day for him.	Ɛyɛ da pa ma no.
This needs to be done here too.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi wɔ ha nso.
He used to be quite hard on himself.	Kan no na ɔyɛ den koraa wɔ ne ho.
His friends are jealous.	Ne nnamfo ani bere.
Get out of the way, please!	Mesrɛ wo, fi kwan no so!
It was very cold in the room.	Ná awɔw wom kɛse wɔ dan no mu.
I have used them every day.	Mede wɔn adi dwuma da biara da.
You know the ones.	Wunim wɔn no.
Besides, he is not here now.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, onni ha mprempren.
And everywhere else.	Na baabi foforo biara nso.
On the same street.	Wɔ abɔnten koro no ara so.
We have so much to do in the morning.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ anɔpa.
He was very interested in it.	Ná n’ani gye ho yiye.
Accept that for what it is.	Gye saa asɛm no tom sɛnea ɛte.
But you can’t have both, man.	Nanso worentumi nnya abien no nyinaa, ɔbarima.
He will be worth whatever he has then.	Ɔbɛyɛ bo biara a ɔwɔ saa bere no.
Put your trust in it and trust it.	Fa wo ho to so na fa wo ho to so.
Something to think about, at least.	Biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
I like the latter more.	M’ani gye akyiri yi no ho kɛse.
What! 	Dɛn!
It’s the same out here.	Ɛte saa ara wɔ ha akyi.
Have a little fun.	Gye w’ani kakra.
It seemed like a good thing to him.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ade pa ma no.
This guy can do that.	Saa ɔbarima yi betumi ayɛ saa.
A really long walk.	Nantew tenten ankasa.
The gun is one thing.	Tuo no yɛ ade biako.
He hoped it wasn't him.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ ɔno.
This is a difficult but important task.	Eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den nanso ɛho hia.
Give it to him.	Fa ma no.
There are three different types.	Ahorow ahorow abiɛsa na ɛwɔ hɔ.
He was really good to me.	Ná ɔyɛ ade pa ma me ankasa.
At least that’s my opinion anyway.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne m’adwene ɔkwan biara so.
I use this system too.	Me nso mede saa nhyehyɛe yi yɛ adwuma.
He knows he has to tell her everything.	Onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka biribiara kyerɛ no.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani gye ho saa.
He wants me to be happy.	Ɔpɛ sɛ m’ani gye.
I look after my son.	Mehwɛ me ba no.
He says we hurt, so let us hurt.	Ɔka sɛ yɛyɛ yaw, enti momma yɛn yaw.
But everyone could see what was going on.	Nanso na obiara tumi hu nea ɛrekɔ so.
Older people often forget simple things.	Mpɛn pii no, wɔn a wɔn mfe akɔ anim werɛ fi nneɛma a ɛnyɛ den.
This is important.	Eyi ho hia.
Simpler, but better.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw, nanso eye sen saa.
It’s exciting, and dangerous.	Ɛyɛ anigye, na asiane nso.
That letter means a lot to me.	Saa krataa no kyerɛ pii ma me.
I will give you the letter in the morning.	Mede krataa no bɛma wo anɔpa.
You get that right away.	Wo nsa ka saa ntɛm ara.
My end of the world.	Me awiei.
This is certainly true.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
I love my dog.	M’ani gye me kraman ho.
I’m so excited!.	M’ani gye ho!.
He worked for you.	Ná ɔyɛ adwuma ma wo.
This picture is my favorite.	Saa mfonini yi ne nea m’ani gye ho paa.
He must have been on the ground.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔde fam.
We are all in our best years.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ yɛn mfe a eye sen biara.
Hurry to the car!	Yɛ ntɛm kɔ kar no mu!
No one knows how many.	Obiara nnim dodow ahe.
He stepped up to her side.	Ɔde ne nan sii ne nkyɛn.
No one seemed to notice any of them.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara anhu wɔn mu biara.
We can see them.	Yebetumi ahu wɔn.
It has been around for a long time.	Ɛwɔ hɔ bere tenten ni.
If this is the case, do so.	Sɛ eyi a, yɛ saa.
But it’s not that easy.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
There is too much and too little.	Ɛdɔɔso dodo ne kakraa bi nso wɔ hɔ.
I am as tall as him but much leaner.	Me tenten te sɛ ɔno nanso meyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
Our next thing.	Yɛn ade a edi hɔ.
Look and give take your city.	Hwɛ na fa ma fa wo kurow no.
I spent a little time.	Mede bere kakra dii dwuma.
Everyone was in danger.	Ná obiara wɔ asiane mu.
What a thrilling movie!	Sini a ɛyɛ anigye bɛn ara ni!
Or something like that .	Anaasɛ biribi a ɛte saa .
Don't deal with him, he lies a lot.	Mma wo ne no nni, odi atoro pii.
So he could tell anyone.	Enti na obetumi aka akyerɛ obiara.
He really wants to be with her.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne no tra ankasa.
So this is the first step.	Enti eyi ne ade a edi kan a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
He didn't need to be with her.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔne no bɔ.
He spent all his money on unnecessary things.	Ɔde ne sika nyinaa yɛɛ nneɛma a ɛho nhia.
But it was just words.	Nanso na ɛyɛ nsɛm ara kwa.
Is that what.	So ɛno ne nea.
What is the issue? 	Dɛn ne asɛm no?
Grab what you can, while you can get it.	Fa nea wubetumi, bere a wubetumi anya no.
What a story they must have had to tell at home.	Hwɛ asɛm a ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka wɔ fie.
But again, things are not that simple.	Nanso bio, nneɛma nyɛ mmerɛw saa.
I am getting better every day though.	Mereyɛ yiye da biara da nanso.
This is done on a large scale.	Wɔyɛ eyi wɔ ade kɛse bi so.
There is one other thing,' he added.	Ade foforo biako nso wɔ hɔ,’ ɔde kaa ho.
He was very cooperative with them.	Ná ɔne wɔn yɛ biako kɛse.
Or someone else.	Anaasɛ obi foforo.
After that, things fell into place.	Ɛno akyi no, nneɛma hwee ase.
The bus was late there.	Ná bɔs no aka akyi wɔ hɔ.
So what? 	Enti dɛn?
They don’t care about them.	Wɔn ho nhia wɔn.
Someone mentioned walking earlier.	Obi adi kan aka nantew ho asɛm.
I would appreciate any and all help.	M’ani begye mmoa biara ne ne nyinaa ho.
The issue is very complicated.	Asɛm no mu yɛ den yiye.
For me, that is impossible.	Wɔ me fam no, ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
He’s interested in children.	N’ani gye mmofra ho.
I have many more, if you want to see them sometime.	Mewɔ pii bio, sɛ wopɛ sɛ wuhu wɔn bere bi a.
Or don't, it's up to you.	Anaasɛ nyɛ saa, ɛyɛ wo na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
What a great idea.	Adwene kɛse bɛn ara ni.
Better forget about that.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wo werɛ mfi saa asɛm no.
He is strong.	Ɔyɛ den.
That really means a lot to me.	Ɛno kyerɛ pii ma me ankasa.
This really isn’t that big of a deal.	Eyi ankasa nyɛ asɛm kɛse saa.
Many people are still unemployed.	Nnipa pii da so ara nni adwuma.
We have	Yɛde .
He is with them.	Ɔka wɔn ho.
Here is a picture of it.	Ne mfonini ni.
We cannot understand each other.	Yɛrentumi nte yɛn ho yɛn ho ase.
No one was supposed to be in the final.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara wɔ nea etwa to no mu.
The picture is below.	Mfonini no wɔ ase ha.
The bus ride will be faster.	Bɔs a wɔde bɛkɔ no bɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
I think it doesn’t matter.	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
The child made a good point.	Abofra no kaa asɛm pa bi.
There was still something to be done.	Ná biribi da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Start with brisk walking several days a week.	Fi ase de nantew ntɛmntɛm nna pii dapɛn biara.
It would have been fun.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
For a moment nothing showed.	Bere tiaa bi no, biribiara ankyerɛ.
All the music you want, when you want it and where you want it.	Nnwom a wopɛ nyinaa, bere a wopɛ ne baabi a wopɛ.
The system works normally.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛ adwuma sɛnea ɛsɛ.
It didn’t seem like there was anything interesting out there.	Na ɛnyɛ te sɛ nea biribi a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ abɔnten.
But he had nothing to do with her.	Nanso na ɔne no nni hwee yɛ.
He was the only one who knew he was real.	Ɔno nkutoo na na onim sɛ ɔyɛ obi ankasa.
That’s my daily routine.	Ɛno ne me da biara da kwan.
However, yours is not.	Nanso, wo de no nyɛ saa.
That should solve the problem.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno di ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
It was a hot day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ hyew.
He is always there for me.	Ɔwɔ hɔ ma me bere nyinaa.
This is happening fast.	Eyi rekɔ so ntɛmntɛm.
We can win the battle.	Yebetumi adi nkonim.
This is really the best year for me.	Eyi ne afe a eye sen biara ankasa ama me.
I just lie down and do it and sleep comes over me.	Meda fam kɛkɛ na meyɛ na nna ba me so.
That was nothing new.	Ná ɛno nyɛ ade foforo.
Many of my friends wanted to use it.	Ná me nnamfo pii pɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma.
It was also in my school.	Na ɛwɔ me sukuu mu nso.
It’s just cold.	Ɛyɛ awɔw nkutoo.
The problem with food is huge.	Ɔhaw a ɛwɔ aduan ho no yɛ kɛse.
And it’s the same thing.	Na ɛte saa ara.
Not even a picture of him.	Ɛnyɛ ne mfonini mpo.
You do indeed do that.	Woyɛ saa ampa.
And it’s just not what I do.	Na ɛnyɛ nea meyɛ ara kwa.
He knew that, if anyone knew.	Ná onim saa, sɛ obi nim a.
When should we do it?	Bere bɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ?
He didn't know what to do now.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛyɛ mprempren.
I love the cast and crew.	M’ani gye wɔn a wɔyɛ sini no ne wɔn a wɔyɛ adwuma no ho.
I'm talking about the kids.	Meka mmofra no ho asɛm.
There are good things here.	Nneɛma pa wɔ ha.
It’s my favorite one.	Ɛyɛ nea m’ani gye ho paa.
After all, he owns the free plan.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, ɔno na ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe a wɔde ma kwa no.
Or anyone else.	Anaasɛ obiara.
Shape to your liking and set aside.	Yɛ no sɛnea wopɛ na fa to nkyɛn.
I thought he was wonderful.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔyɛ nwonwa.
It seemed to work well.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
However, we have to do our part.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ yɛn fam de.
You know the rest.	Wunim nea aka no.
All of it, this time.	Ne nyinaa, saa bere yi.
We are very happy with the arrangement.	Yɛn ani agye nhyehyɛe no ho yiye.
But it is unlikely.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
Most of it seemed to be paper.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne fã kɛse no ara yɛ krataa.
You’re not even a real person.	Wonyɛ onipa ankasa mpo.
I feel really bad.	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ bɔne ankasa.
It’s hard to tell now.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka mprempren.
However, he was surprised.	Nanso, ne ho dwiriw no.
I didn’t know him at the time.	Saa bere no na minnim no.
I know you do that.	Minim sɛ woyɛ saa.
And for a while, he had that.	Na bere tiaa bi no, na ɔwɔ saa.
Don’t go there.	Mma nkɔ hɔ.
Real people who are your friends.	Nokware nnipa a wɔyɛ wo nnamfo.
Tell me what you want.	Ka nea wopɛ kyerɛ me.
That took planning.	Ɛno gyee nhyehyɛe.
A tall girl for her age.	Abeawa tenten bi ma ne mfe.
I don't know how to do that.	Minnim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a mɛyɛ saa.
My wife is wonderful.	Me yere yɛ nwonwa.
So here we are.	Enti ha na yɛwɔ.
He didn't know what to do to help.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛyɛ de aboa.
I thought it was my time.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ me bere.
Not these people.	Ɛnyɛ saa nkurɔfo yi.
They have to be completely attentive to what he is doing.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔn adwene koraa ma nea ɔreyɛ no.
I love the complexity.	M’ani gye sɛnea ɛyɛ den no ho.
But no one else did.	Nanso obi foforo biara anyɛ saa.
There are things you don’t know.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a wunnim.
That in itself is exciting.	Ɛno ankasa yɛ anigye.
But it was all working.	Nanso na ne nyinaa yɛ adwuma.
See this is a girl to me.	Hwɛ eyi yɛ abeawa ma me.
In one moment three things happened.	Wɔ bere biako mu no nneɛma abiɛsa sii.
Perhaps they should.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I think they are a good thing.	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ ade pa.
Just always go through everything.	Kɛkɛ bere nyinaa fa biribiara a ɛwɔ hɔ no mu.
Just a bed.	Mpa bi kɛkɛ.
He loved it all.	Ná n’ani gye ne nyinaa ho.
There must be a.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
However, I want to make one point.	Nanso, mepɛ sɛ meka asɛm biako.
This is not the end of the story.	Eyi nyɛ asɛm no awiei.
Someone needs to point me in the right direction.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi kyerɛ me kwan pa.
I just can’t do that.	Mintumi nyɛ saa ara kwa.
The year you don’t want to end.	Afe a wompɛ sɛ wode bɛba awiei no.
For me it really works.	Wɔ me fam no ɛyɛ adwuma ankasa.
He glanced at the paper.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ krataa no so.
No one, including me.	Obiara nni hɔ, a me ka ho.
But somehow it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɔkwan bi so no, ɛnyɛ hwee.
This is a serious mistake.	Eyi yɛ mfomso kɛse.
They don’t just make mistakes.	Ɛnyɛ mfomso ara kwa na wɔyɛ.
This may have some truth to it.	Ebia eyi wɔ nokware bi wɔ ho.
This dog has been so good.	Saa ɔkraman yi ayɛ yiye saa.
He spent the weekend following the city.	Ɔde dapɛn awiei no dii kurow no akyi.
Like your mother.	Te sɛ wo maame.
You don’t want it to be mental.	Wompɛ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwene mu ade.
However, this information can be expensive.	Nanso, nsɛm yi betumi ayɛ nea ne bo yɛ den.
Very easy to touch.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wode wo nsa bɛka.
We need to bring them all here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde wɔn nyinaa ba ha.
Don’t believe them.	Nnye wɔn nni.
We can see him.	Yebetumi ahu no.
First, it wasn’t true.	Nea edi kan no, na ɛnyɛ nokware.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia.
Planning is done and the information is developed.	Wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe ho nhyehyɛe na wɔyɛ nsɛm no.
It definitely has the money.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛwɔ sika no.
Unusually busy on weekends.	Adagyew a ɛnyɛ ne kwan so wɔ dapɛn awiei.
He seemed very weak.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Many people are in grave danger.	Nnipa pii wɔ asiane kɛse mu.
I knew him a little bit.	Ná minim no kakra.
I was alone that evening.	Ná me nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ saa anwummere no.
Two should be a police matter.	Ɛsɛ sɛ abien yɛ polisifo asɛm.
Someone did this.	Onipa bi yɛɛ eyi.
Whether one does it is not the point.	Sɛ́ ebia obi bɛyɛ no saa no nyɛ asɛm no.
It wasn’t just an idea.	Na ɛnyɛ adwene bi kɛkɛ.
So, the truth.	Enti, nokware no.
I think you’ve done a good job.	Misusuw sɛ woayɛ adwuma pa.
He's too good for me.	Ɔyɛ papa dodo ma me.
The result is that.	Nea afi mu aba ne sɛ.
We’ve both worked on it to make it work.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa ayɛ ho adwuma na ama ayɛ adwuma.
I really don't know which is best.	Ankasa minnim nea eye sen biara.
It may be a little bit.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ kakraa bi.
He was this, that, and whatever.	Ná ɔyɛ eyi, saa, ne nea ɛte biara.
Maybe it’s the time of year.	Ebia ɛyɛ afe no mu bere.
Maybe no one else knows.	Ebia obi foforo biara nnim.
Like it’s not that hard.	Te sɛ nea ɛnyɛ den saa.
At least for a few hours.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi.
This is a fact of life.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nokware.
And maybe that was the same.	Na ebia na ɛno nso te saa ara.
I might just do some of that.	Ebia mɛyɛ saa nneɛma no bi kɛkɛ.
He also knew what he liked.	Ná onim nea n’ani gye ho nso.
I thought hard about this.	Misusuw eyi ho denneennen.
Finally, after hours of trying.	Awiei koraa no, bere a wɔde nnɔnhwerew pii abɔ mmɔden akyi no.
And that’s really important, that’s very important.	Na ɛno ho hia ankasa, ɛno ho hia yiye.
No one should touch it.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka.
Stay in your room.	Tra wo dan mu.
And that was the truth, he seemed happy, happy.	Na ɛno ne nokware no, na ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye, na n’ani agye.
Time, it just seems like enough.	Bere, ɛte sɛ nea ɛdɔɔso ara kwa.
Not for something that important.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛho hia saa nti.
It’s worse than anyone thought.	Ɛyɛ bɔne sen sɛnea obiara susuwii.
I am sure it will be very successful.	Migye di sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye kɛse.
I can’t have this in my house.	Mintumi nnya eyi wɔ me fie.
But that doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛno mfa ho.
He glanced outside the window.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ mfɛnsere no akyi.
Just let me get this down me first.	Kɛkɛ ma me mfa eyi nkɔ fam me kan.
I made a great discovery the other day.	Mihuu ade kɛse bi da bi a atwam no.
In the end.	Wɔ awiei no.
You could tell no one wanted to be there.	Ná wubetumi ahu sɛ obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ.
Whatever you’re interested in.	Nea w’ani gye ho biara.
Bad people are good.	Nnipa bɔne yɛ papa.
It’s new to me.	Ɛyɛ foforo ma me.
And for one year it seemed to be spent happily.	Na afe biako no na ɛte sɛ nea wɔde di dwuma anigye so.
I need your input.	Me hia wo nsɛm a wode bɛka ho.
And this is often true.	Na eyi taa yɛ nokware.
Do you want to go with me?	Wopɛ sɛ wo ne me kɔ?
Everything had to go on from then on.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ biribiara kɔ so fi saa bere no.
The man worked.	Ɔbarima no yɛɛ adwuma.
He loved every bit of it.	Ná n’ani gye ne fã biara ho.
He’s here and he loves the job.	Ɔwɔ ha na n’ani gye adwuma no ho.
Both were simple.	Ná abien no nyinaa yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Something terrible has happened there.	Biribi a ɛyɛ hu asi wɔ hɔ.
They are just wonderful.	Wɔyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
All he thought was that he had.	Nea na osusuw ara ne sɛ wayɛ saa.
His father was a shoemaker.	Ná ne papa yɛ obi a ɔyɛ mpaboa.
It’s not all about sex.	Ɛnyɛ nna ho asɛm nyinaa.
This looks really amazing.	Eyi hwɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
And another a week later.	Na foforo nso dapɛn biako akyi.
I feel uneasy around you.	Mete nka sɛ me ho nyɛ me den wɔ wo ho.
We have these books in our school.	Yɛwɔ saa nhoma ahorow yi wɔ yɛn sukuu mu.
Someone brought him to me.	Obi de no baa me nkyɛn.
He will be three years old.	Ɔbɛyɛ mfe abiɛsa.
I have to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
The time of the.	Bere no.
Two hours every morning.	Nnɔnhwerew abien anɔpa biara.
These materials are tough and waterproof.	Saa nneɛma yi yɛ den na nsu ntumi nkɔ mu.
Nowadays, people are interested in many different types of tests.	Mprempren, nkurɔfo ani gye sɔhwɛ ahorow pii ho.
Time is bigger than that.	Bere yɛ kɛse sen saa.
Provide food.	Fa aduan ma.
Everyone should know that now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara hu saa mprempren.
I expected to play with two hands then.	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ mede nsa abien bɛbɔ saa bere no.
The meeting will continue tomorrow.	Nhyiam no bɛkɔ so ɔkyena.
We do things right.	Yɛyɛ nneɛma yiye.
That put him above everyone else.	Ɛno de no dii obiara so.
As you see the picture.	Sɛnea wuhu mfonini no.
Children think that everyone who does bad things is very bad.	Mmofra susuw sɛ obiara a ɔyɛ bɔne no yɛ bɔne paa.
They were quite good.	Ná wɔyɛ papa koraa.
The task was hopeless.	Ná adwuma no yɛ nea anidaso biara nni mu.
If everything went well.	Sɛ biribiara kɔɔ yiye a.
And most importantly, no man will touch you.	Na nea ɛho hia sen biara no, ɔbarima biara nni hɔ a ɔbɛka wo.
He was a child.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra.
I want to know one more thing.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu ade biako bio.
Many people say that nothing is impossible.	Nnipa pii ka sɛ biribiara ntumi nyɛ.
If he really wanted to he would work for her.	Sɛ ɔpɛ ampa a ɔbɛyɛ adwuma ama no.
He seems unwell.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne ho nyɛ no yiye.
Keep doing what you’re doing.	Kɔ so yɛ nea woreyɛ no.
I had to be careful.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye.
Something had happened here recently.	Ná biribi asi wɔ ha nnansa yi ara.
I had to take the job.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ migye adwuma no.
They have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I really like them.	M’ani gye wɔn ho ankasa.
I am very sorry for you.	Mepa wo kyɛw kɛse.
Now is the time to act.	Mprempren ne bere a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi.
For at least a month.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɔsram biako.
Take good care of your children.	Hwɛ wo mma yiye.
It's going on for the last month.	Ɛrekɔ so ama ɔsram a etwaam no.
I could decide that pretty easily.	Ná metumi asi saa ho gyinae a ɛnyɛ den koraa.
I am always beautiful.	Meyɛ fɛ bere nyinaa.
I really enjoyed this movie.	M’ani gyee sini yi ho yiye.
Thus, there are problems that many people are aware of.	Enti, ɔhaw ahorow wɔ hɔ a nnipa pii nim.
You know better than that.	Wunim yiye sen saa.
He took them home.	Ɔde wɔn kɔɔ fie.
Take it while you can.	Fa no bere a wubetumi.
I will give him this and this,	Mede eyi ne eyi bɛma no, .
In that room.	Wɔ saa dan no mu.
One was short and the other long.	Ná biako yɛ tiaa na biako nso tenten.
I was very impressed.	M’ani gyee ho kɛse.
It’s not just fun anymore.	Ɛnyɛ anigye ara kwa bio.
All the forces are one.	Tumi ahorow no nyinaa yɛ biako.
There was one child, a boy.	Ná abofra biako wɔ hɔ, abarimaa bi.
Time is running out.	Bere aba awiei.
Or at least not the absolute truth.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nokware a edi mũ no.
Face to face is the thing.	Anim ne anim ne ade no.
This can be a good opportunity for us to make friends.	Eyi betumi ayɛ hokwan pa ama yɛn sɛ yɛbɛyɛ nnamfo.
During the year, the boy had many friends.	Wɔ afe no mu no, na abarimaa no wɔ nnamfo pii.
They are beautiful people.	Wɔyɛ nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
If only it were you.	Sɛ ɛyɛ wo a, anka ɛbɛyɛ papa.
He did this just as quickly as the first time.	Ɔyɛɛ eyi ntɛmntɛm te sɛ nea edi kan no ara pɛ.
You can use that time for many realistic things.	Wubetumi de saa bere no ayɛ nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ nokware.
I could watch that all day, all week.	Ná metumi ahwɛ saa da mũ nyinaa, dapɛn mũ no nyinaa.
That is the most important thing.	Ɛno ne ade a ɛho hia kɛse.
I don’t know when it is.	Minnim bere a ɛyɛ.
Like his father, he had little interest in school.	Te sɛ ne papa no, na n’ani nnye sukuu ho kɛse.
By itself, that wasn’t really a problem.	Ɛno ankasa, na ɛno nyɛ ɔhaw ankasa.
There is no work to be done.	Adwuma biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He has to tell her that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka saa kyerɛ no.
He’s quite an intelligent man, you know.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔwɔ nyansa koraa, wunim.
After that, though, things went well.	Nanso, ɛno akyi no, nneɛma kɔɔ so yiye.
Go somewhere else.	Kɔ baabi foforo.
Consider the first case for a moment.	Susuw asɛm a edi kan no ho kakra.
Remember that you are important and flawless.	Kae sɛ wo ho hia na mfomso biara nni wo ho.
Maybe it’s my situation and my circumstances.	Ebia ɛyɛ me tebea ne me tebea.
About everything really.	Wɔ biribiara ho ankasa.
That is if you want my help.	Ɛno ne sɛ wopɛ me mmoa a.
This is the product.	Eyi ne ade a wɔde yɛ no.
He slipped his hands inside.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ mu.
Think about tomorrow.	Susuw ɔkyena ho hwɛ.
The first week, things were fine.	Dapɛn a edi kan no, na nneɛma yɛ yiye.
There was no one there.	Ná obiara nni hɔ.
It’s still alive with everything.	Ɛda so ara te ase ne biribiara.
Just your money, and that’s it.	Wo sika kɛkɛ, na ɛno ara ne no.
Production was expensive.	Ná nneɛma a wɔyɛ no bo yɛ den.
I could never do that.	Na mintumi nyɛ saa da.
Certainly not.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnte saa.
I know this is terrible.	Minim sɛ eyi yɛ hu.
It was just something that happened.	Ná ɛyɛ biribi a asi ara kwa.
And I can’t do it.	Na mintumi nyɛ.
There was no child on the road.	Ná abofra biara nni kwan so.
I tell them that’s the first step.	Meka kyerɛ wɔn sɛ ɛno ne ade a edi kan a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
In demonstrating power.	Wɔ tumi a wɔde kyerɛ mu.
Anyway.	Ɛnyɛ hwee.
There are no other circumstances on that.	Tebea foforo biara nni hɔ wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Language is important.	Kasa ho hia.
I thought of some other money.	Misusuw sika foforo bi ho.
Number like one on top of one.	Dodow te sɛ biako wɔ biako so.
The more you do it, the better it feels.	Dodow a woyɛ no, dodow no ara na ɛte nka yiye.
I felt a little innocent.	Metee nka sɛ me ho nni asɛm kakra.
It’s a good game.	Ɛyɛ agoru pa.
I don’t even want to do it.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ mpo.
He is in his room.	Ɔwɔ ne dan mu.
He was sitting there alone.	Ná ɔno nkutoo te hɔ.
It works for me.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ma me.
You can get one.	Wubetumi anya bi.
And it’s not the same thing.	Na ɛnyɛ ade koro.
I still had plenty of money at this point.	Ná meda so ara wɔ sika pii saa bere yi.
But nothing had worked out as he had planned.	Nanso na biribiara nyɛɛ yiye sɛnea na wayɛ ho nhyehyɛe no.
But that’s not how it works.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na ɛyɛ adwuma.
They all have equal rights.	Wɔn nyinaa wɔ hokwan a ɛyɛ pɛ.
Again, there is no problem.	Bio nso, ɔhaw biara nni ho.
Everyone knows about them.	Obiara nim wɔn ho asɛm.
Not the police, not the police.	Ɛnyɛ polisifo, ɛnyɛ polisifo.
All of us.	Yɛn nyinaa.
The article would cover all the details.	Ná asɛm no bɛka nsɛm no nyinaa ho asɛm.
It’s so hard, but so young.	Ɛyɛ den saa, nanso ɛyɛ abofra saa.
It just doesn’t work.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma kɛkɛ.
The right way to do it.	Ɔkwan pa no.
So tell him down below in the comments section.	Enti ka kyerɛ no wɔ ase hɔ wɔ nsɛm a wɔka ho asɛm no fã hɔ.
Years of experience.	Mfe pii a wɔde ayɛ adwuma.
This is not easy for me to do.	Eyi nyɛ mmerɛw mma me sɛ mɛyɛ.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho.
I can handle anything.	Metumi adi biribiara ho dwuma.
The meeting was a disaster.	Ná nhyiam no yɛ asiane kɛse.
But it’s not everything.	Nanso ɛnyɛ biribiara.
However, they were both mentally strong and alert.	Nanso, na wɔn baanu nyinaa adwene mu yɛ den na wɔn ani da hɔ.
Like he never wanted anything.	Te sɛ nea na ɔmpɛ biribiara da.
This seems to work.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ adwuma.
This story has been going on for a long time.	Saa asɛm yi akɔ so akyɛ.
There is only one thing we need to do.	Ade biako pɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
He wants everyone to like him.	Ɔpɛ sɛ obiara ani gye ne ho.
He really did his best.	Ɔyɛɛ nea obetumi biara ankasa.
It was going home.	Ná ɛrekɔ fie.
A man who travels by car.	Ɔbarima bi a ɔde kar tu kwan.
At least the filmmakers have expressed that opinion.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔn a wɔyɛ sini no aka saa adwene no.
But there was more.	Nanso na nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ.
It’s the system itself.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe no ankasa.
He immediately put it inside.	Ntɛm ara na ɔde hyɛɛ mu.
We had to do a lot of other things.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nneɛma foforo pii.
Attend the meeting today.	Kɔ nhyiam no ase nnɛ.
This seems to have happened many years ago.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi sii mfe pii a atwam ni.
You play the game with me.	Wo ne me di agoru no.
They didn’t like each other.	Na wɔn ani nnye wɔn ho wɔn ho ho.
You will become stronger.	Wobɛyɛ den.
However, it is certainly important.	Nanso, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛho hia.
Put yourself down.	Fa wo ho to fam.
In most cases.	Mpɛn pii no.
The dinner is arranged.	Wɔyɛ anwummere aduan no ho nhyehyɛe.
That’s built into the system, and it works.	Ɛno na wɔde ahyɛ nhyehyɛe no mu, na ɛyɛ adwuma.
I just want to say.	Mepɛ sɛ meka ara kwa.
Look at each other.	Hwɛ mo ho mo ho.
He’s a nice guy.	N’ani gye ne ho.
I couldn’t do that.	Na mintumi nyɛ saa.
He was leading her in a different direction.	Ná ɔde no rekɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
The classes are ongoing.	Adesua ahorow no rekɔ so.
Or, it seems to be.	Anaasɛ, ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
There is no need for him to do so.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
There is pain .	Ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ yaw .
It’s not anything observational.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara a wɔde hwɛ ade yiye.
What happened is ugly.	Nea esii no yɛ nea ɛnyɛ fɛ.
It was one of those years.	Ná ɛyɛ saa mfe no mu biako.
I want to talk to him today.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa nnɛ.
I know his children.	Minim ne mma no.
He glances at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛ no.
Just one time.	Bere biako pɛ.
It’s what we signed up for.	Ɛyɛ nea yɛde yɛn nsa hyɛɛ ase.
If you want to.	Sɛ wopɛ a.
I used to love it.	Kan no na m’ani gye ho.
It looked nice enough.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He wasn’t really himself.	Ná ɔnyɛ ɔno ankasa.
Someone had to do their job.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ wɔn adwuma.
Any problem, that’s all.	Ɔhaw biara, ɛno ara ne no.
I can't believe he's working so quickly.	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɔreyɛ adwuma ntɛm saa.
And do some more work.	Na yɛ adwuma bi bio.
Don’t get started.	Mma mfi ase.
But maybe that’s just as well.	Nanso ebia ɛno nso te saa ara.
However, there is another reason.	Nanso, biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ a enti a ɛte saa.
Get out of the house.	Fi fie hɔ.
We need to take you somewhere.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde wo kɔ baabi.
And in that first year.	Na wɔ saa afe a edi kan no mu.
But there is hope.	Nanso anidaso wɔ hɔ.
His head was pounding.	Ná ne ti rebɔ.
The thing had a name.	Ná ade no wɔ din.
He seemed fresh and important.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ foforo na ne ho hia.
I don’t like the man, and he doesn’t like me.	M’ani nnye ɔbarima no ho, na ɔno nso ani nnye me ho.
We rely on water.	Yɛde yɛn ho to nsu so.
You see it over and over again.	Wuhu no mpɛn pii.
No one else came but him.	Obi foforo biara amma gye sɛ ɔno nkutoo.
But this is a mistake.	Nanso eyi yɛ mfomso.
I can’t believe it.	Me ntumi nnye nni.
But that was a mistake.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ mfomso.
You can do whatever you want.	Wubetumi ayɛ biribiara a wopɛ.
Be aware of the timing.	Hu bere a wɔde bɛma no yiye.
Or what was going on, for that matter.	Anaasɛ nea na ɛrekɔ so, sɛnea ɛte no.
That approach is obviously not optimal.	Ɛda adi sɛ saa kwan no nyɛ nea eye sen biara.
You can move on to another subject.	Wubetumi akɔ asɛm foforo so.
Things are not like that.	Nneɛma nte saa.
Either way works.	Ɔkwan abien no mu biara yɛ adwuma.
For one thing, there was only one of him.	Ade biako ne sɛ na ne mu biako pɛ wɔ hɔ.
He’s interested in it.	N’ani gye ho.
I just don’t know when that day will be.	Minnim bere a saa da no bɛyɛ ara kwa.
This wasn’t necessary.	Ná eyi ho nhia.
They do bad things.	Wɔyɛ nneɛma bɔne.
Remove a little fur.	Yi aboa nhoma kakra fi hɔ.
I look after them in every way.	Mehwɛ wɔn wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
Both seem hopeless.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔn baanu nyinaa nni anidaso biara.
You want your people on the best deals at the least cost.	Wopɛ wo nkurɔfo wɔ nneɛma a eye sen biara so a anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛho ka.
John recovered completely after a week.	John ho tɔɔ no koraa wɔ dapɛn biako akyi.
I totally understand why so many people reach for this.	Mete nea enti a nnipa pii de wɔn nsa ka eyi no ase koraa.
Surely you can.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wubetumi.
All his wishes came true.	Nea ɔpɛ nyinaa baa mu.
There is a lot of truth in that.	Nokware pii wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
No one is behind it.	Obiara nni akyi.
The phone itself could do the rest.	Ná telefon no ankasa betumi ayɛ nea aka no.
But it wasn’t him.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɔno.
Everyone is really him.	Obiara ne no ankasa.
Two good years.	Mfe pa abien.
People put a lot of effort in there.	Nkurɔfo bɔ mmɔden kɛse wɔ hɔ.
Everyone, without exception, was concerned about the accident.	Obiara, a obiara nka ho, na akwanhyia no haw no.
Not much ago, not even that much.	Ɛnyɛ pii a atwam ni, ɛnyɛ saa mpo.
He is your head.	Ɔyɛ wo ti.
He says I’m not happy.	Ɔka sɛ m’ani nnye.
It wasn't very good.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea eye koraa.
People tend to stay awake at this time of year.	Nkurɔfo taa da hɔ wɔ afe no mu bere yi mu.
The moon was full.	Ná ɔsram no ayɛ ma.
But it was fun!.	Nanso na ɛyɛ anigye!.
Both of them could do that.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa betumi ayɛ saa.
That has nothing to do with it.	Ɛno ne no nni hwee yɛ.
I am new to this concept.	Meyɛ foforo wɔ saa adwene yi ho.
It seems to be easy.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
But not on much.	Nanso ɛnyɛ pii so.
This is our story.	Eyi ne yɛn asɛm.
I'm supposed to drive you.	Me na ɛsɛ sɛ meka wo kar.
I want people to like me.	Mepɛ sɛ nkurɔfo ani gye me ho.
It has been for many years.	Mfe pii na ayɛ saa.
They just seem happy.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani agye ara kwa.
Or, the car could be a problem.	Anaasɛ, kar no betumi ayɛ ɔhaw.
But it was eventually applied to a small number of people.	Nanso awiei koraa no wɔde dii dwuma wɔ nnipa kakraa bi ho.
Just give these people a chance!	Ma saa nkurɔfo yi hokwan kɛkɛ!
It’s all a game.	Ne nyinaa yɛ agoru.
I know you are faster than me.	Minim sɛ woyɛ ntɛm sen me.
Make sure none of the kids are playing.	Hwɛ hu sɛ mmofra no mu biara nni agoru.
You are right to ask me to do that.	Woayɛ no yiye sɛ wobɛka akyerɛ me sɛ menyɛ saa.
That’s a fact.	Ɛno yɛ nokware.
It doesn’t feel like work.	Ɛnte nka sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
But he immediately thought of many more things.	Nanso n’adwene yɛɛ no ​​ntɛm ara yɛɛ nsɛm pii bio.
We were warm and fuzzy.	Ná yɛn ho yɛ hyew.
But he and I were the only ones in the room.	Nanso na me ne ɔno nkutoo na ɛwɔ dan no mu.
Every day is likely to be painful.	Ɛda adi sɛ da biara bɛyɛ yaw.
It’s a spectacular one.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I want you by my side and in my bed.	Mepɛ sɛ wowɔ me nkyɛn ne me mpa so.
As you know.	Sɛnea wunim no.
Maybe it was an accident, after all.	Ebia na ɛyɛ akwanhyia, ne nyinaa akyi.
Everything was starting to feel a little empty.	Ná biribiara afi ase reyɛ te sɛ nea hwee nni mu kakra.
It doesn’t surprise me.	Ɛnyɛ me nwonwa.
The man fell to the ground.	Ɔbarima no hwee fam.
The dog's fur is usually waterproof.	Mpɛn pii no, nsu ntumi nkɔ ɔkraman no ho nhwi mu.
There are so many things here and there.	Nneɛma pii wɔ ha ha.
But that is a mistake.	Nanso ɛno yɛ mfomso.
And no one had to tell me.	Na na ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara kyerɛ me.
It’s not just about money.	Ɛnyɛ sika ho asɛm nkutoo.
Look at that, it’s amazing!	Hwɛ saa, ɛyɛ nwonwa!
I wanted to make authentic music.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nnwom a ɛyɛ nokware.
The really remarkable thing about him is that he is strong.	Ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa wɔ ne ho nsɛm mu ne sɛ ɔyɛ den.
In the end, the truth prevailed.	Awiei koraa no, nokware no dii nkonim.
We forgot you.	Yɛn werɛ fii wo.
There is hardly any room for a dog there.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ baabi nni hɔ ma ɔkraman wɔ hɔ.
It wasn’t just a job.	Na ɛnyɛ adwuma bi kɛkɛ.
It may be a little bit.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ kakraa bi.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
Start with their names.	Fa wɔn din fi ase.
I'm just glad you're here.	M'ani agye ara kwa sɛ wowɔ ha.
I can work on it.	Metumi ayɛ adwuma wɔ ho.
But neither is life.	Nanso nkwa nso nyɛ saa.
Just know this.	Hu eyi ara kwa.
He is a little weak.	Ɔyɛ mmerɛw kakra.
It would all work out for the best.	Ná ne nyinaa bɛkɔ yiye ama nea eye sen biara.
After that, we spent a lot of time together.	Ɛno akyi no, yɛde bere pii bɔɔ mu.
However, the situation is more complicated.	Nanso, tebea no mu yɛ den sen saa.
They need to tell us.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka kyerɛ yɛn.
That would be exciting.	Ɛno bɛyɛ anigye.
Not in a bad way.	Ɛnyɛ saa wɔ ɔkwan bɔne so.
I still felt it was dangerous.	Ná meda so ara te nka sɛ asiane wom.
Maybe in another movie.	Ebia wɔ sini foforo mu.
He glanced at her several times.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ne nkyɛn mpɛn pii.
The road is too crowded at lunch time.	Nnipa ahyɛ kwan no so ma dodo wɔ awia aduan bere mu.
Their children do the same.	Wɔn mma nso yɛ saa ara.
It really didn't matter either story.	Ná ɛnyɛ asɛm abien no mu biara ho hwee ankasa.
Now there is an interesting idea.	Seesei adwene bi a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ hɔ.
For the child, it’s not a big deal.	Wɔ abofra no fam no, ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse.
They are beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
At least we can agree on that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yebetumi ayɛ adwene wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
A whole new system.	Nhyehyɛe foforo koraa.
All the way all the way.	Ɔkwan no nyinaa nyinaa.
Therefore, he gave them some.	Ɛno nti, ɔde bi maa wɔn.
I told you it didn’t work the first time.	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma bere a edi kan no.
I fell into this a lot.	Me pii hwee eyi mu.
Think about who you are.	Susuw onipa a woyɛ no ho.
More importantly than that.	Nea ɛho hia kɛse sen saa.
I slipped into his arms.	Mede me ho bɔɔ ne ho.
They were both very passionate about it.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa ani gye ho kɛse.
You need to know this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu eyi.
It was a very busy morning.	Ná ɛyɛ anɔpa a adagyew nnim koraa.
You just have to be amazing.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
In the old house	Ofie dedaw no mu
Kick your feet to the music!	Fa wo nan bɔ nnwom no so!
But it doesn’t have to be.	Nanso enhia sɛ ɛte saa.
I’m excited about that.	M’ani agye saa asɛm no ho.
Along the way, a man offered him one.	Wɔ kwan so no, ɔbarima bi de bi maa no.
I can try.	Metumi abɔ mmɔden.
So that’s what happened.	Enti ɛno ne nea esii.
Being human doesn’t matter.	Onipa a wobɛyɛ no nyɛ hwee.
But maybe he would have.	Nanso ebia anka ɔbɛyɛ saa.
The offense runs too far.	Mfomso no tu mmirika kɔ akyiri dodo.
It was too late for that.	Ná aka akyi dodo ama saa.
They drove out of town.	Wɔde kar fii kurow no mu.
I was the problem.	Ná me ne ɔhaw no.
It’s just too big.	Ɛyɛ kɛse dodo ara kwa.
He had a soft spot for children.	Ná ɔwɔ baabi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ma mmofra.
But the problems go deeper than that.	Nanso ɔhaw ahorow no kɔ akyiri sen saa.
So just believe it.	Enti gye di kɛkɛ.
It was certainly wrong.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛyɛ bɔne.
You're doing well.	Woreyɛ yiye.
Let me do it this way.	Ma menyɛ no saa kwan yi so.
I know my father.	Minim me papa.
He headed for the door of the house.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ofie no pon no ano.
Anything is possible.	Biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye.
It didn’t seem to matter.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia.
Our story has nothing to do with that.	Yɛn asɛm no ne saa asɛm no nni hwee yɛ.
Is that okay?.	So ɛno yɛ yiye?.
He was big, but handsome.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse, nanso na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
The first one here.	Nea edi kan wɔ ha.
I like it better my way, don't you?.	M'ani gye ho yiye me kwan so, ɛnte saa?.
This house is great.	Saa ofie yi yɛ kɛse.
It has worked for almost every other industry.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ayɛ adwuma ama nnwuma foforo biara.
He had to be innocent.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ obi a ne ho nni asɛm.
I got a job offer.	Me nsa kaa adwuma bi.
, but no pictures.	, nanso mfonini biara nni mu.
And walk the open path.	Na nantew ɔkwan a ɛda hɔ no so.
Everything does it, and it’s everything.	Biribiara yɛ no, na ɛyɛ biribiara.
He’s a big, strong, strong guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse, ɔyɛ den, ɔyɛ den.
It’s weird in a way.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
It was cold in this room.	Ná awɔw wom wɔ saa dan yi mu.
Whether it is a.	Sɛ́ ɛyɛ a.
Each of them is important.	Wɔn mu biara ho hia.
I completely understand what you mean.	Mete nea wopɛ sɛ woka no ase koraa.
Don’t always believe what people tell you.	Nnye nea nkurɔfo ka kyerɛ wo no nni bere nyinaa.
He didn't want to have to rely on the gun.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho to tuo no so.
He told me things were busy.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ nneɛma nni adagyew.
There was never a problem.	Ɔhaw biara amma da.
It has definitely got my attention.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ anya m’adwene.
I'll go with you if you want.	Me ne wo bɛkɔ sɛ wopɛ a.
These schools use the same curriculum.	Saa sukuu ahorow yi de adesua nhyehyɛe koro no ara na edi dwuma.
Her clothes were too big for her.	Ná ne ntade no ayɛ kɛse dodo ama no.
According to the literature, this point is unclear.	Sɛnea nhoma ahorow kyerɛ no, asɛm yi mu nna hɔ.
The power of this study is significant.	Tumi a ɛwɔ adesua yi mu no yɛ nea ɛho hia.
He was the stronger of the two.	Ɔno na na ne ho yɛ den sen wɔn baanu no mu.
I think there are two things.	Misusuw sɛ nneɛma abien bi wɔ hɔ.
However, it was good.	Nanso, na eye.
Demonstrate yourself.	Da wo ho adi.
It was very impressive.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
I still don’t do that.	Meda so ara nyɛ saa.
Make it very difficult.	Ma ɛnyɛ den yiye.
Maybe it was the shoes.	Ebia na ɛyɛ mpaboa no.
It wasn’t their style.	Ná ɛnyɛ wɔn su.
We all have to travel a lot.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa tu kwan pii.
With lots of hair.	Ne ti nhwi pii.
Do it quickly.	Yɛ no ntɛmntɛm.
How beautiful they are!	Hwɛ sɛnea wɔn ho yɛ fɛ!
These two have both.	Saa baanu yi wɔ abien no nyinaa.
But one day.	Nanso da koro bi.
I hope this is the case.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ eyi te saa.
He seems to know a lot about her.	Ɛte sɛ nea onim ne ho nsɛm pii.
Pick it up and see how you like it!.	Fa no na hwɛ sɛnea w’ani gye ho!.
You need to think about why.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw nea enti a ɛte saa no ho.
I believe it will be.	Migye di sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I was also a sinner.	Ná me nso meyɛ bɔne.
It’s just too dangerous.	Ɛyɛ asiane kɛse ara kwa.
So there is no problem in using their information.	Enti ɔhaw biara nni wɔn nsɛm a wɔde bedi dwuma no mu.
In other words, working from the present to the past.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, adwuma a wɔyɛ fi mprempren de kɔ bere a atwam no mu.
He looked about the same age as his father.	Ná ne ho te sɛ ne papa mfe bɛyɛ sɛ.
There is no time left.	Bere biara nni hɔ a aka.
That was a lie.	Ná ɛno yɛ atoro.
That sounded like a great deal.	Ɛno yɛɛ te sɛ asɛm kɛse.
No one cares what you think.	Obiara mfa nea wususuw ho.
He was nothing much.	Ná ɔnyɛ hwee kɛse.
It is as it should be.	Ɛte saa sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
No one can fully understand their power, both good and bad.	Obiara ntumi nte wɔn tumi ase yiye, papa ne bɔne nyinaa.
The books mean nothing to him.	Nhoma ahorow no nkyerɛ hwee mma no.
And a man did come forward moments later.	Na ɔbarima bi baa anim ampa bere tiaa bi akyi.
Not like this morning.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ anɔpa yi.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia.
He was very weak.	Ná ɔyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
I would like to see some more information here.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nsɛm foforo bi wɔ ha.
Good thing, in a way.	Ade pa, ɔkwan bi so.
He is a beautiful boy.	Ɔyɛ abarimaa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
And that’s what I love.	Na ɛno ne nea m’ani gye ho.
The age of books was gone.	Ná nhoma mfe no atwam.
He has a big mouth.	Ɔwɔ ano kɛse.
If not, play it.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, bɔ no.
Might as well do the same thing for tomorrow, too.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ade koro no ara ama ɔkyena, nso.
Much to admire about it.	Pii a ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye ho wɔ ho.
Talk about it face to face.	Ka ho asɛm anim ne anim.
You either do or you don’t.	Woyɛ anaasɛ wonyɛ.
That got his attention.	Ɛno maa n’adwene sii so.
Don’t touch that! 	Mfa wo nsa nka saa!
he will say.	ɔbɛka sɛ.
However, it is still not understood why.	Nanso, ɛda so ara nte nea enti a ɛte saa no ase.
I feel like though.	Mete nka sɛ nanso.
The next moment, he concentrated.	Bere a edi hɔ no, ɔde n’adwene nyinaa sii so.
There is no one outside.	Obiara nni abɔnten.
There were no words.	Ná nsɛm biara nni hɔ.
At least for a while.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, bere tiaa bi.
The team put in a lot of effort.	Kuw no bɔɔ mmɔden kɛse.
It would have been.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
This party was a lot of fun.	Ná saa apontow yi yɛ anigye kɛse.
I am in a great state of mind.	Mewɔ adwene tebea kɛse mu.
So hurry up and hurry up!	Enti yɛ ntɛm yɛ ntɛm!
And that certainly makes the point.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno ma asɛm no yɛ asɛm kɛse.
This has happened many times.	Eyi asi mpɛn pii.
A large snake lay on the ground.	Ná ɔwɔ kɛse bi da fam.
That’s my plan for today.	Ɛno ne me nhyehyɛe ma nnɛ.
And you’re interested in doing so.	Na w’ani gye ho sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
Do the books mention this.	So nhoma ahorow no ka eyi ho asɛm.
I was in the city every night.	Ná mewɔ kurow no mu anadwo biara.
I see that today.	Mihu saa nnɛ.
I think this is a good thing.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ ade pa.
It was such an evening.	Ná ɛyɛ anwummere a ɛte saa.
Or he bumped his way.	Anaasɛ ɔde ne ho bɔɔ ne kwan so.
I bring it to every meeting.	Mede ba nhyiam biara ase.
I can get a job, if need be.	Metumi anya adwuma, sɛ ɛho hia a.
He’s a squirrel!	Ɔyɛ ɔkraman!
But it will be more.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ pii.
A big and complicated story.	Asɛm kɛse a ɛyɛ den.
That doesn’t make it easy.	Ɛno mma ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
Be extra careful next time.	Hwɛ yiye kɛse bere foforo.
After all, this was a game.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na eyi yɛ agoru.
I'm not just hot anymore.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ me ho ayɛ hyew kɛkɛ bio.
Man has been winter.	Onipa ayɛ awɔw bere.
He had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Food was excellent.	Ná aduan yɛ fɛ yiye.
To be with me.	Sɛ́ wobɛka me ho.
I will introduce one first.	Mede biako bɛba kan.
Don’t say anything.	Nka asɛm biara.
The police got him one.	Polisifo no nyaa bi maa no.
And maybe it was true.	Na ebia na ɛyɛ nokware.
The truth is not one thing.	Nokware no nyɛ ade biako pɛ.
There were also music parties.	Ná nnwom apontow ahorow nso wɔ hɔ.
In either case, I’m not sure.	Wɔ tebea abien no nyinaa mu no, m’ani nnye ho.
This can be the case.	Eyi betumi ayɛ.
I don’t think it will be a successful project.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma a edi mu.
The rest are gone.	Wɔn a aka no nni hɔ bio.
Talk about human rights!	Ka hokwan ahorow a nnipa wɔ ho asɛm!
I think about people, mostly.	Misusuw nnipa ho, dodow no ara.
I definitely give them all the time on the road.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mede bere nyinaa ma wɔn wɔ kwan so.
Sorry but it’s the truth.	Pa kyɛw nanso ɛyɛ nokware no.
Even when it was happening it wasn’t happening.	Bere a na ɛrekɔ so mpo no na ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so.
Not that he could have anyway.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na obetumi anya bi ɔkwan biara so.
Don't give up.	Ma na fa.
Detainees are quick to join.	Wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho to afiase no yɛ ntɛm de wɔn ho hyɛ mu.
But not like this.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛ eyi.
The dog was very strong and very alive.	Ná ɔkraman no ho yɛ den yiye na na ɔte ase yiye.
And that’s not like him.	Na ɛno nso nte sɛ ɔno.
The same is true of this one.	Saa ara na eyi nso te.
It was a great one.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse.
But their food is amazing.	Nanso wɔn aduan no yɛ nwonwa.
I feel like a madman.	Mete nka sɛ ɔbarima bi a ne ho ayɛ no hyew.
The total number of them.	Wɔn mu dodow no nyinaa.
I think that is the case now.	Misusuw sɛ ɛte saa mprempren.
His father was gone.	Ná ne papa nni hɔ bio.
You just put it there.	Wode to hɔ ara kwa.
You can see children in the school.	Wubetumi ahu mmofra wɔ sukuu no mu.
He has enough of it.	Ɔwɔ nea ɛdɔɔso.
My wife is doing well.	Me yere reyɛ yiye.
He has worked night after night.	Wayɛ adwuma anadwo biara anadwo.
The reason for this is unclear.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no mu nna hɔ.
I loved everything about it.	M’ani gyee ho biribiara ho.
They all do the same thing.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ saa ara.
I really like them, though.	Nanso, m’ani gye wɔn ho ankasa.
That’s why it’s important to do it right.	Ɛno nti na ɛho hia sɛ yɛyɛ no yiye no.
He knows it better than anyone.	Onim no yiye sen obiara.
It was quite simple.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
Remember it’s dinner time.	Kae sɛ ɛyɛ anwummere aduan bere.
Believe me, this is a very big deal around here.	Gye me di, eyi yɛ asɛm kɛse paa wɔ ha ho.
I used it well.	Mede dii dwuma yiye.
Thank you so much for your help.	Meda mo ase pii wɔ mo mmoa no ho.
This house has been vacant for many years.	Mfe pii ni a obiara nni ofie yi mu.
I don't think about it again until recently.	Minsusuw ho bio de besi nnansa yi ara.
The more powerful the better.	Dodow a tumi wom no, dodow no ara na eye.
This thing is hard.	Saa ade yi yɛ den.
The window overlooked the backyard.	Ná mfɛnsere no hwɛ akyi hɔ.
I love it all, I love it.	M’ani gye ne nyinaa ho, m’ani gye ho.
Aside from that, it’s pretty cool.	Sɛ ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
You don’t do anything important.	Wonyɛ nea ɛho hia biara.
As if you were making a story out of it.	Te sɛ nea na woreyɛ asɛm bi afi mu.
Of course, we do.	Ampa, yɛyɛ saa.
There was no one in the house.	Ná obiara nni fie hɔ.
He was too short and too weak.	Ná ɔyɛ tiaa dodo na na ɔyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
Maybe it didn’t matter.	Ebia na ɛnyɛ hwee.
You can never have too many friends.	Worentumi nnya nnamfo pii da.
I've been obsessed with this for a couple of hours.	Mede me ho ahyɛ eyi so nnɔnhwerew abien ni.
The reason for this.	Nea enti a ɛte saa.
The details are below.	Nsɛm no ho nsɛm wɔ ase ha.
Keep improving yourself.	Kɔ so yɛ wo ho yiye.
He was a great guy to work for.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma ma no.
I talked about it with my mind.	Me ne m’adwene kaa ho asɛm.
It’s a really amazing picture.	Ɛyɛ mfonini a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
It was getting colder.	Ná awɔw reyɛ kɛse.
This doesn’t just mean sex, this means power.	Eyi nkyerɛ nna nkutoo, eyi kyerɛ tumi.
Otherwise you’ll never know.	Anyɛ saa a worentumi nhu da.
I think that’s his name.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne ne din.
Let someone else play.	Ma obi foforo nni agoru.
No wonder they do well.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ wɔyɛ ade yiye.
The accident happened very quickly.	Akwanhyia no sii ntɛmntɛm paa.
I understand completely.	Mete ase koraa.
There are many of them.	Ne mu pii wɔ hɔ.
He hadn't been for years.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa mfe pii ni.
He says he does.	Ɔka sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I’m not doing it.	Ɛnyɛ me na mereyɛ.
He lives there with his wife and two children.	Ɔne ne yere ne ne mma baanu te hɔ.
Water, as we all know, is important.	Nsu, sɛnea yɛn nyinaa nim no, ho hia.
There was never anyone else.	Ná obi foforo biara nni hɔ da.
What is the value of that? 	Dɛn ne ɛno?
Get to know him better.	Hu no yiye.
We all want more.	Yɛn nyinaa pɛ pii.
For them, things are going quite well.	Wɔ wɔn fam no, nneɛma rekɔ so yiye koraa.
They are a group.	Wɔyɛ kuw bi.
That would be pretty cool.	Ɛno bɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
It was never necessary.	Ná ɛho nhia da.
Check out my previous posts.	Hwɛ me nsɛm a atwam no.
The kids loved it.	Mmofra no ani gyee ho.
Indeed.	Ampa ara.
Many people have tried.	Nnipa pii abɔ mmɔden.
Certainly some of these books have some things in common.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nhoma ahorow yi bi wɔ nneɛma bi a ɛyɛ pɛ.
He wasn’t good.	Ná ɔnyɛ papa.
You want me to give you that information for free.	Wopɛ sɛ mede saa nsɛm no ma wo kwa.
So he brought her to his car.	Saa na ɔno nso de no baa ne kar mu.
And it was beautiful.	Na ɛyɛ fɛ.
Their words give you a mouthful.	Wɔn nsɛm no ma wo ano.
I'm just saying.	Meka kɛkɛ sɛ.
They are both in the same way.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa wɔ ɔkwan koro so.
It looked like he could have walked in from the street.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea anka obetumi afi abɔnten so akɔ mu.
Go back after this.	San kɔ eyi akyi.
Do a little bit of it.	Yɛ kakraa bi.
But it was an amazing time.	Nanso na ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
The music part is not that much harder.	Nnwom fã no nyɛ den kɛse saa.
The excitement is very intense.	Anigye no mu yɛ den yiye.
And include me in it.	Na fa me ka ho.
A gun does not.	Tuo bi nyɛ saa.
I hope you all enjoy it.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo nyinaa ani begye ho.
It has to be something you know and something you have.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ biribi a wunim ne biribi a wowɔ.
The book is amazing.	Nhoma no yɛ nwonwa.
The water was not quite warm yet.	Ná nsu no nnya nyɛɛ hyew koraa.
I didn’t know that, but I couldn’t have gotten any better.	Na minnim saa, nanso na mintumi nnya biribi a eye sen saa.
It’s not as hard as it sounds.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛnea ɛte no.
You should have seen my house.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu me fie.
I only knew the man.	Ná minim ɔbarima no nkutoo.
The problem is the money.	Ɔhaw no ne sika no.
Later, he painted many of these paintings.	Akyiri yi, ɔyɛɛ saa mfonini ahorow yi pii ho mfonini.
Most people were just not interested.	Ná nnipa dodow no ara ani nnye ho ara kwa.
Moreover, they work.	Bio nso, wɔyɛ adwuma.
That was what he had to do.	Ɛno ne nea na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
There is no annuity.	Afe afe sika biara nni hɔ.
This can very well be the case.	Eyi betumi ayɛ saa yiye.
They blame you for their own problems.	Wɔde wɔn ankasa haw ahorow to wo so.
Too many things to think about.	Nneɛma pii dodo a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
Not much is said.	Ɛnyɛ pii na wɔka.
Where has everyone gone?	Ɛhe na obiara akɔ?
We will do our best to help you.	Yɛbɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara de aboa wo.
All the way through.	Ɔkwan no nyinaa so.
It wasn’t going to be pretty.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ fɛ.
But one important driving point remains.	Nanso asɛm biako a ɛho hia sɛ wɔka kar no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
I just worked.	Meyɛɛ adwuma ara kwa.
Are you with us?.	So wo ne yɛn wɔ hɔ?.
The problem is that.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ.
She was beautiful, very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ, na ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
The performance was fantastic!	Ná agoru no yɛ nwonwa!
I do that a lot.	Meyɛ saa pii.
At least not when they were young.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ bere a na wɔyɛ mmofra no.
We cannot prove it either way.	Yɛrentumi nkyerɛ sɛ asɛm no te wɔ ɔkwan abien no nyinaa so.
He is doing a work in you.	Ɔreyɛ adwuma bi wɔ wo mu.
You will, without a doubt.	Wobɛyɛ, akyinnye biara nni ho.
But there was an opportunity.	Nanso na hokwan bi wɔ hɔ.
Lots of moving costs.	Nneɛma a wɔde kɔ baabi foforo ho ka pii.
Except it wasn’t a good plan.	Gye sɛ na ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe pa.
The perfect way.	Ɔkwan a edi mũ no.
None of that mattered.	Ná ɛno mu biara ho nhia.
It was all over.	Ná ne nyinaa aba awiei.
But he is his own.	Nanso ɔno ne ne de.
The simple things are usually the best.	Mpɛn pii no, nneɛma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no ne nea eye sen biara.
Save us who are weak.	Gye yɛn a yɛyɛ mmerɛw no.
The head was down.	Ná ti no abɔ fam.
Summer is such a busy time.	Awɔw bere yɛ bere a adagyew nnim saa.
You can make my paper way.	Wubetumi ayɛ me krataa kwan.
That will continue to happen.	Ɛno bɛkɔ so akɔ so.
Why it should be true is another matter.	Nea enti a ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware no yɛ asɛm foforo.
That is true, not to be added later.	Ɛno yɛ nokware, ɛnyɛ sɛ wɔde bɛka ho akyiri yi.
I don’t know what’s next.	Minnim nea edi hɔ.
He is new here.	Ɔyɛ foforo wɔ ha.
A look of excitement lingered in his eyes.	Anigye a ɛte sɛ nea ɛrekɔ so no traa n’ani so.
There are many of them at this time.	Wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ saa bere yi.
That is not wise.	Ɛno nyɛ nyansa.
I am heading home again.	Mede m’ani kyerɛ fie bio.
But I see what you mean.	Nanso mihu nea wopɛ sɛ woka.
I can’t do anything about him.	Mintumi nyɛ ne ho hwee.
I don’t know why, but it’s true.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa, nanso ɛyɛ nokware.
No one should see him here.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara hu no wɔ ha.
The way it should be.	Ɔkwan a ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
You can see the chart below.	Wubetumi ahu nhyehyɛe a ɛwɔ ase hɔ no.
That doesn’t mean they don’t care.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm.
They were in pairs, the two of them.	Ná wɔyɛ baanu baanu, wɔn baanu.
When you’re on the outside, looking in, it’s much harder.	Sɛ wowɔ abɔnten, hwɛ mu a, ɛyɛ den kɛse.
It’s just happening.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
Everyone should know that go inside.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara hu sɛ kɔ mu.
And none of them could see it now.	Na wɔn mu biara antumi anhu mprempren.
As far as I know, it still doesn’t have a name.	Sɛnea minim no, ɛda so ara nni din.
The way it is.	Sɛnea ɛte.
I watch every morning.	Mehwɛ anɔpa biara.
How it should work.	Sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
But that’s the nature of this game.	Nanso ɛno ne agoru yi su.
He can give it to you right away.	Obetumi de ama wo ntɛm ara.
But he didn't know what else to do.	Nanso na onnim nea ɔnyɛ bio.
Play us to them.	Bɔ yɛn nkɔ wɔn nkyɛn.
Lots of comments about it.	Nsɛm pii a wɔka fa ho.
You need to make the case immediately.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ asɛm no ntɛm ara.
An interesting movie.	Sini a ɛyɛ anigye.
I know you’re going to love this leg a lot.	Minim sɛ w’ani begye saa nan yi ho kɛse.
And many of us want it for nothing.	Na yɛn mu pii pɛ no kwa.
He is a very bad person.	Ɔyɛ onipa a ɔnyɛ papa koraa.
I think about a lot of things.	Misusuw nneɛma pii ho.
I'll take you with me, mostly.	Mede wo bɛka me ho, dodow no ara.
At best, a necessary evil.	Sɛnea eye sen biara no, bɔne bi a ɛho hia.
It seemed familiar to me.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea minim no yiye.
However, this is what we can do for you.	Nanso, eyi yɛ nea yebetumi ayɛ ama mo.
It’s not a difficult path.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ den.
He was already like them.	Ná ɔte sɛ wɔn dedaw.
Water is essential for life.	Nsu ho hia kɛse ma nkwa.
That’s simply not true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware kɛkɛ.
Now it hurts to do both.	Seesei ɛyɛ yaw sɛ wobɛyɛ abien no nyinaa.
He seemed to do so.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ saa.
They like it a little bit.	Wɔn ani gye ho kakra.
You are.	Woyɛ.
It was a wonderful day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Nor is it necessary to do so.	Saa ara nso na ɛho nhia sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
I’m not so excited today.	M’ani nnye ho kɛse nnɛ.
And the look of the car.	Na sɛnea kar no te nso.
I’d like them to build themselves.	M’ani begye ho sɛ wɔn ankasa besi dan.
These words shocked them.	Saa nsɛm yi maa wɔn ho dwiriw wɔn.
Maybe the whole thing was a mistake.	Ebia na ade no nyinaa yɛ mfomso.
Too many problems.	Ɔhaw ahorow pii dodo.
We can make a lot of money from this project.	Yebetumi anya sika kɛse afi saa adwuma yi mu.
They are certainly beautiful.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
Everything would have been saved.	Anka biribiara begye nkwa.
No one had a phone.	Ná obiara nni telefon.
If you think that	Sɛ wususuw sɛ .
I wanted to be one too.	Ná me nso mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biako.
She wanted to talk about her children.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka ne mma ho asɛm.
But it is still not true by any means.	Nanso ɛda so ara nyɛ nokware ɔkwan biara so.
We use it for everything.	Yɛde yɛ biribiara.
He had done so.	Ná wayɛ saa.
That is not the situation we have before us in this case.	Ɛnyɛ saa ne tebea a yɛwɔ wɔ yɛn anim wɔ asɛm yi mu.
If you're not happy, we're not happy.	Sɛ w'ani nnye a, yɛn ani nnye.
I just thought they liked me.	Misusuwii ara ne sɛ wɔn ani gye me ho.
Our sins are forgiven.	Wɔde yɛn bɔne akyɛ yɛn.
For dog food.	Wɔ kraman aduan ho.
He must have been working.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɔreyɛ adwuma.
I have a lot of things to do.	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
Why do you charge so much?	Dɛn nti na wugye sika pii saa?
I have to work a bit now anyway.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma kakra mprempren ɔkwan biara so.
So, you can find them easily.	Enti, wubetumi ahu wɔn a ɛnyɛ den.
If you want to talk to us, fine.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ wo ne yɛn kasa a, ɛyɛ.
Is this what you see on yours?.	So eyi ne nea wuhu wɔ wo de so?.
This face of the.	Saa anim yi.
I had some people to thank.	Ná mewɔ nnipa bi a ɛsɛ sɛ meda wɔn ase.
Biking to work was a great opportunity.	Ná sakre a wɔde kɔ adwuma no yɛ hokwan kɛse.
Nothing here is complicated.	Biribiara nni ha a ɛyɛ den.
Everyone spoke of him as a great man.	Obiara kaa ne ho asɛm sɛ ɔyɛ onipa kɛse.
Run the water test.	Tu mmirika kɔ nsu ho sɔhwɛ no mu.
I love what he’s doing.	M’ani gye nea ɔreyɛ no ho.
You may not know that.	Ebia na wunnim saa.
It’s almost always a book.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nhoma bere nyinaa.
Maybe even actually.	Ebia mpo ankasa.
It was just an interesting story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm bi a ɛyɛ anigye ara kwa.
But they seemed happy.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani agye.
It was then night.	Saa bere no na ɛyɛ anadwo.
Sleep now, my son.	Da mprempren, me ba.
Hope you enjoy it!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho!.
I am one of those users.	Meyɛ saa nnipa a wɔde di dwuma no mu biako.
It was just hard.	Ná ɛyɛ den ara kwa.
This book is very expensive.	Nhoma yi bo yɛ den yiye.
There are so many things to do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I desperately wanted to go with them.	Ná mepɛ denneennen sɛ me ne wɔn kɔ.
Every day a new problem arises.	Da biara da ɔhaw foforo bi ba.
Too much food in the summer, and too little in the winter.	Aduan pii dodo wɔ awɔw bere mu, na kakraa bi na ɛwɔ awɔw bere mu.
The results show that this is indeed the case.	Nea afi mu aba no kyerɛ sɛ eyi te saa ampa.
This can definitely be an issue.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi betumi ayɛ asɛm.
My room is more like my room at the summer house.	Me dan no te sɛ me dan a ɛwɔ awɔw bere mu fie hɔ no kɛse.
It was very scary.	Ná ɛyɛ hu yiye.
In this way, he will feel better.	Saa kwan yi so no, ne ho bɛtɔ no.
And look at the.	Na hwɛ.
Both kids love this book.	Mmofra baanu no nyinaa ani gye nhoma yi ho.
No one is truly perfect.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ pɛ ankasa.
This is a beautiful one.	Eyi yɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
I look at the door.	Mehwɛ ɔpon no ano.
For the sake of his people.	Ne nkurɔfo nti.
Turn just a little further this way.	Dan kɔ akyiri kakra kɛkɛ wɔ saa kwan yi so.
Very good that too.	Eye paa ɛno nso.
Do you think he can do well?	Wususuw sɛ obetumi ayɛ yiye?
You have a wonderful story to tell.	Wowɔ asɛm bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛsɛ sɛ woka.
It’s just my opinion.	Ɛyɛ m’adwene ara kwa.
I just wanted some.	Ná mepɛ bi kɛkɛ.
He was very fond of money.	Ná ɔpɛ sika paa.
Their meetings were brief.	Ná wɔn nhyiam ahorow no yɛ tiaa.
It was a human being.	Ná ɛyɛ onipa bi.
I want both of them.	Mepɛ abien no nyinaa.
That’s not the one.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne no.
I’m amazed at how well it’s going.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa sɛnea ɛrekɔ yiye no.
I am wrong then.	Meyɛ mfomso saa bere no.
I still work full time.	Meda so ara yɛ adwuma bere nyinaa.
I signed another one.	Mede me nsa hyɛɛ foforo ase.
Maybe it was his hair.	Ebia na ɛyɛ ne ti nhwi.
But he likes it there.	Nanso n’ani gye ho wɔ hɔ.
But there is something else.	Nanso biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
Where we are.	Baabi a yɛwɔ.
In this way, the.	Wɔ saa kwan yi so.
It’s something underneath .	Ɛyɛ biribi a ɛwɔ ase .
Walk in the story.	Nantew wɔ asɛm no mu.
As in, right now.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ, mprempren yi ara.
The whole atmosphere was filled with joy.	Anigye hyɛɛ tebea no nyinaa ma.
The friends you had are still your friends.	Nnamfo a na wowɔ no da so ara yɛ wo nnamfo.
This will likely take some time.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi begye bere kakra.
That’s why he’s here.	Ɛno nti na ɔwɔ ha no.
However, that doesn’t end the story.	Nanso, ɛno mma asɛm no mma awiei.
I don't know why at all.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa koraa.
The police are doing a very good job.	Polisifo no reyɛ adwuma yiye paa.
Where will they take him.	Ɛhe na wɔde no bɛkɔ.
A truly beautiful book.	Nhoma a ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
He knew exactly what to say.	Ná onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka no yiye.
It will be exciting.	Ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
Think about it that way.	Susuw ho saa.
It’s a powerful thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a tumi wom.
And, anyway.	Na, ɔkwan biara so.
But the room was empty.	Nanso na hwee nni dan no mu.
Again, it’s very simple.	Bio nso, ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Don’t work like that here.	Mma adwuma saa wɔ ha.
We will be more like that.	Yɛbɛyɛ te sɛ ɛno kɛse.
I really enjoy going.	M’ani gye ho ankasa sɛ mɛkɔ.
But, that’s the thing.	Nanso, ɛno ne ade no.
It wasn’t like that.	Ná ɛnte saa.
I don't know who had the first one, really.	Minnim onii a na ɔwɔ nea odi kan no, ampa.
But these things he brings.	Nanso saa nneɛma yi na ɔde ba.
Like, a good person.	Te sɛ, onipa pa.
He paces back and forth.	Ɔde mmirika kɔ anim ne akyi.
The first time is to present the idea.	Bere a edi kan ne sɛ wɔde adwene no bɛma.
More on that here.	Ɛno ho nsɛm pii wɔ ha.
However, it is not.	Nanso, ɛnte saa.
This worked great for us.	Eyi yɛɛ adwuma kɛse maa yɛn.
None of them were there.	Ná wɔn mu biara nni hɔ.
It’s a great house.	Ɛyɛ ofie kɛse bi.
I still can't figure out what to do about it.	Meda so ara ntumi nhu nea mɛyɛ wɔ ho.
Nothing else is on offer here.	Biribiara foforo biara nni ha a wɔde bɛma.
The night was still young.	Ná anadwo no da so ara yɛ abofra.
We can’t just do it in the schools.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ wɔ sukuu ahorow no mu nkutoo.
That now seems highly unlikely.	Mprempren ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye koraa sɛ ɛno bɛba.
He didn't have to do that.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
This is your time.	Eyi ne wo bere.
Say it so that it is real.	Ka no sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Everything takes time.	Biribiara gye bere.
This is just great.	Eyi yɛ kɛse ara kwa.
I didn’t care what he and his mother thought of us.	Ná m’ani nnye nea ɔne ne maame susuw wɔ yɛn ho no ho.
There were many things he wanted to think about first.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a na ɔpɛ sɛ odi kan susuw ho.
Certainly not with the man.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ ɔbarima no nkyɛn.
Inappropriate.	Ɛnyɛ papa.
I loved every moment of that.	M’ani gyee saa bere biara ho.
I am in a state of mind.	Mewɔ adwene tebea bi mu.
I'm tasting them.	Meka wɔn hwɛ.
This is your last chance!	Eyi ne hokwan a etwa to a wowɔ!
He didn't have to bother her.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔhaw no.
We need to do another test.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ sɔhwɛ foforo.
It seems that.	Ɛte sɛ nea.
It’s still pretty cool.	Ɛda so ara yɛ fɛ yiye.
The man slams the gun down.	Ɔbarima no de tuo no bɔ fam.
Like you right now.	Te sɛ wo mprempren ara.
I don’t know anything else.	Minnim biribi foforo biara.
They were children.	Ná wɔyɛ mmofra.
We have a lot of jobs.	Yɛwɔ nnwuma pii.
The danger overcomes it, the will to go on.	Asiane no di so nkonim, ɔpɛ a ɛwɔ hɔ sɛ ɔbɛkɔ so no.
Exciting, everyday work.	Adwuma a ɛyɛ anigye, a wɔyɛ no da biara da.
I have to hear it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete.
That day has passed.	Saa da no atwam.
Everything went well.	Biribiara kɔɔ yiye.
It’s not something like that.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
Each of you has a weak spot.	Mo mu biara wɔ baabi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw.
I love that kind of thing.	M’ani gye saa ade no ho.
Everyone knows what to do.	Obiara nim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
So use it wisely.	Enti fa di dwuma yiye.
He is, to you, perfect in every way.	Ɔyɛ, wɔ mo fam no, ɔyɛ pɛ wɔ biribiara mu.
She is beautiful just the way she is.	Ɔyɛ fɛ sɛnea ɔte no ara pɛ.
Nor is it an accident.	Saa ara nso na ɛnyɛ akwanhyia.
He was in the back, where he liked it.	Ná ɔwɔ akyi, baabi a n’ani gye ho.
New information has emerged on this subject.	Nsɛm foforo aba wɔ saa asɛm yi ho.
The same isn’t true.	Saa ara na ɛnyɛ saa.
This is our house.	Yɛn fie ni.
I only had two and that was a while ago.	Na mewɔ abien pɛ na ɛno yɛ bere tiaa bi a atwam ni.
I saw him.	Mihuu no.
Morning is not the time of your day, not so early.	Anɔpa nyɛ wo da no mu bere, ɛnyɛ ntɛm saa.
The city is a large and bustling city.	Kurow no yɛ kurow kɛse a nnipa pii wɔ hɔ.
I'm right there right there.	Me wɔ hɔ wɔ hɔ ara.
Many people have signed the petition.	Nnipa pii de wɔn nsa ahyɛ krataa no ase.
Not in everything.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara mu.
You look like him.	Wo ho te sɛ ɔno.
So he drives my car.	Enti ɔno na ɔka me kar no.
Very interesting but full of information.	Ɛyɛ anigye yiye nanso nsɛm ahyɛ mu ma.
Look at the floor.	Hwɛ fam hɔ.
Just give it to me.	Ma me kɛkɛ.
The latter seems to be the case.	Ɛte sɛ nea nea etwa to no te saa.
, and not the final paper.	, na ɛnyɛ krataa a etwa to.
But this is also not true.	Nanso eyi nso nyɛ nokware.
You can get them at the door.	Wubetumi anya wɔn wɔ ɔpon no ano.
And take him to their house.	Na fa no nkɔ wɔn fie.
It was set in him to do it.	Wɔde sii ne mu sɛ ɔnyɛ.
And it had to be that way.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I think about it too much.	Misusuw ho dodo.
But many people don’t share his views.	Nanso nnipa pii ntumi nnye n’adwene no bi.
Few people are animals.	Nnipa kakraa bi na wɔyɛ mmoa.
It is neither good nor bad.	Ɛnyɛ papa anaa bɔne.
It’s support enough for every day.	Ɛyɛ mmoa a ɛdɔɔso ma da biara da.
I did it for him.	Meyɛɛ no.
I know it has for me.	Minim sɛ ɛwɔ ma me.
But again this is a different story.	Nanso bio eyi yɛ asɛm foforo.
Do it quickly.	Yɛ no ntɛm.
If you are an honest person? 	Sɛ woyɛ obi a odi nokware a?
he will say.	ɔbɛka sɛ.
This moment was amazing.	Ná saa bere yi yɛ nwonwa.
No one can deny the importance of learning.	Obiara ntumi nnye hia a adesua ho hia no.
So this is our plan.	Enti eyi ne yɛn nhyehyɛe.
He slipped into it.	Ɔde ne ho too so.
That’s a fact.	Ɛno yɛ nokware.
In the eyes of most people.	Wɔ nnipa dodow no ara anim.
There may be a reason for this.	Ebia biribi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
What else am I supposed to do here.	Dɛn bio na ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ wɔ ha.
It is always with us.	Ɛwɔ yɛn ho bere nyinaa.
He already thinks of you.	Osusuw wo ho dedaw.
Don’t be afraid of it.	Mma w’ani nnye ho.
Anything really goes as long as it’s pretty.	Biribiara kɔ ankasa bere tenten a ɛyɛ fɛ no.
That makes him human.	Ɛno ma ɔyɛ onipa.
The dog needed more power.	Ná ɔkraman no hia tumi pii.
What is your favorite book?	Nhoma bɛn na w’ani gye ho paa?
It must be at night.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anadwo.
It should not be used in any way in a manufacturing environment.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma ɔkwan biara so wɔ baabi a wɔyɛ nneɛma.
He had some books for me.	Ná ɔwɔ nhoma ahorow bi ma me.
But it is not the case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte.
Or does he do that?.	Anaasɛ ɔyɛ saa?.
If he told her.	Sɛ ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​a.
This is not the case now.	Mprempren eyi nte saa.
They were much more expensive.	Ná wɔn bo yɛ den kɛse.
Things got very tense there for a while.	Nneɛma mu yɛɛ den yiye wɔ hɔ bere tiaa bi.
Dinner was late.	Ná anwummere aduan no aka akyi.
This dog is evil.	Saa ɔkraman yi yɛ bɔne.
It is not an opportunity.	Ɛnyɛ hokwan bi.
You’ve made your bed.	Woayɛ wo mpa.
It was like that many times.	Ná ɛte saa mpɛn pii.
It seems to work well.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
We could see it.	Ná yebetumi ahu.
Just remember that for next time.	Kae saa ara kɛkɛ ma bere foforo.
I thought it was quite good.	Misusuwii sɛ eye koraa.
It must be done properly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no yiye.
This experiment was successful.	Saa sɔhwɛ yi dii yiye.
They were doing the same thing.	Ná wɔyɛ ade koro no ara.
He stepped over her closer to the door.	Ɔde ne nan sii ne so bɛn ɔpon no.
We have other things to do.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma foforo a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
However, it doesn’t work.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ adwuma.
And you do it, over and over and over again.	Na woyɛ no, mpɛn pii ne mpɛn pii.
He wrapped his arms around her.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne mu.
This seems wrong to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ mfomso wɔ me fam.
This is not just an opinion, this is a reality.	Eyi nyɛ adwene bi kɛkɛ, eyi yɛ nokware.
I've worked on it.	Mayɛ ho adwuma.
It was about lunch time.	Ná ɛyɛ bɛyɛ awia aduan bere.
That was a big problem.	Na ɛno yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
It’s for everyone.	Ɛyɛ ma obiara.
His gun fell to the ground.	Ne tuo no hwee fam.
The soft, pale water came into his eyes.	Nsu a ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ mmerɛw no baa n’ani so.
There is only one truth.	Nokware biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I love everything about him.	M’ani gye ne ho biribiara ho.
Not my favorite food and not much situation in my opinion.	Ɛnyɛ aduan a m’ani gye ho ne tebea pii wɔ m’adwene mu.
That’s the way he is.	Saa ara na ɔte.
Everything seemed easy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara yɛ mmerɛw.
All those years ago, he'd been hooked.	Saa mfe no nyinaa a atwam no, na wayɛ obi a ne ho ayɛ no hyew.
He is now a music producer.	Mprempren ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ nnwom ho adwuma.
Not even who you know.	Ɛnyɛ mpo sɛ wunim hena.
Check out all the interesting details here.	Hwɛ nsɛm a ɛyɛ anigye a ɛwɔ ha no nyinaa.
We used to do those things.	Ná yɛyɛ saa nneɛma no.
It doesn’t have to be just now.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ mprempren ara kwa.
He thought so too.	Ɔno nso susuwii saa.
Again, it was the last thing he wanted.	Bio nso, na ɛno ne ade a etwa to a na ɔpɛ.
This should be similar to or.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nea ɛte sɛ anaa.
I know, it sounds like a complicated idea.	Minim, ɛte sɛ adwene a ɛyɛ den.
I can’t seem to get anything to work.	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nnya biribiara nyɛ adwuma.
Live for today.	Tra ase ma nnɛ.
I can’t help them.	Mintumi mmoa wɔn.
It has been a year or so with no problems.	Ɛyɛ afe biako anaa nea ɛte saa ni a ɔhaw biara nni ho.
There is no doubt that	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, .
This is dangerous.	Eyi de asiane ba.
I thought he did.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
All content is user friendly.	Nsɛm a ɛwɔ mu nyinaa yɛ nea ɔde di dwuma.
And you are great.	Na woyɛ kɛse.
I don't know what's going on.	Minnim nea ɛrekɔ so.
I put my foot in it.	Mede me nan hyɛ mu.
Or not at all.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ koraa.
So it’s great, that arrangement.	Enti ɛyɛ fɛ yiye, saa nhyehyɛe no.
Otherwise he will be too weak.	Anyɛ saa a ɔbɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
Apparently someone had.	Ɛda adi sɛ na obi anya bi.
The time had come.	Ná bere no adu.
And yet he had.	Na nanso na ɔwɔ.
It must have been an accident.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ akwanhyia bi.
I have invested the first amount.	Mede sika a edi kan no ahyɛ mu.
The qualities are similar.	Su ahorow no te sɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
This house is very old.	Saa ofie yi akyɛ paa.
You know your child well.	Wunim wo ba no yiye.
He was interested in doing so.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
They are real people.	Wɔyɛ nnipa ankasa.
Trust me, you’ll love it there.	Gye me di, w’ani begye ho wɔ hɔ.
But be careful what you wish for.	Nanso hwɛ yiye wɔ nea wopɛ ho.
It will be very difficult.	Ɛbɛyɛ den yiye.
And it was indeed.	Na ɛte saa ampa.
Everything had to come from somewhere else.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ biribiara fi baabi foforo.
However, it still started.	Nanso, ɛda so ara fii ase.
Every single thing.	Ade biako biara.
We like it here a lot.	Yɛn ani gye ho wɔ ha yiye.
I thought it was great.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse.
Such a terrible thing.	Ade a ɛyɛ hu a ɛte saa.
Your wife should be here soon.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo yere ba ha ntɛm.
Everything is included.	Biribiara ka ho.
He did not know what had happened to him.	Ná onnim nea aba ne so.
You just know what to do.	Wunim nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ara kwa.
That can’t be his mother.	Ɛno ntumi nyɛ ne maame.
A boy and his father.	Abarimaa bi ne ne papa.
I keep saying that over and over again, but it’s the truth.	Mekɔ so ka saa mpɛn pii, nanso ɛyɛ nokware no.
Normally, he isn't that good at things.	Mpɛn pii no, ɔnyɛ obi a ɔnyɛ nneɛma yiye saa.
There are many people.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ.
Do so much with one car.	Fa kar biako yɛ pii saa.
It was both of these.	Ná ɛyɛ abien no nyinaa.
You can have any name you want.	Wubetumi anya din biara a wopɛ.
Maybe it was a little bit of both.	Ebia na ɛyɛ abien no nyinaa kakra.
I find it important.	Mihu sɛ ɛho hia.
What seems to be the problem? 	Ɛte sɛ nea dɛn ne ɔhaw no?
I believe my time has come.	Migye di sɛ me bere adu.
But not the same people.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nnipa koro no ara.
It’s a great job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
I have thought you are right.	Mayɛ adwene sɛ woayɛ no yiye.
But we can’t let him go.	Nanso yɛrentumi mma no nkɔ.
Simple and honest work.	Adwuma a ɛnyɛ den na ɛyɛ nokware.
There was something in it.	Na biribi wɔ mu.
He was very strong.	Ná ɔyɛ den yiye.
I surprised him with another one.	Mede foforo yɛɛ no ​​nwonwa.
I don’t want you here.	Mempɛ wo ha.
He acted in a simple manner.	Ɔyɛɛ ade wɔ ɔkwan a ɛnyɛ den so.
I still had some work to do.	Ná meda so ara wɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
So he did that.	Enti ɔyɛɛ saa.
Some of their trials are interesting.	Wɔn sɔhwɛ ahorow no bi yɛ anigye.
It is not the end of the hand.	Ɛnyɛ nsa no awiei.
But the idea is not new.	Nanso adwene no nyɛ ade foforo.
I loved working with him from the first.	M’ani gyee ho sɛ me ne no bɛyɛ adwuma fi nea edi kan no.
It was a great book for me.	Ná ɛyɛ nhoma kɛse ma me.
Everyone knows him.	Obiara nim no.
This sounds expensive.	Eyi te sɛ nea ne bo yɛ den.
That's not nearly surprising enough.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno nyɛ nwonwa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I think he knew anyway.	Misusuw sɛ na onim ɔkwan biara so.
It certainly wasn’t for me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛnyɛ me de.
I want you here for your test.	Mepɛ sɛ wowɔ ha ma wo sɔhwɛ.
He put his hand on hers.	Ɔde ne nsa too ne de so.
That’s what we’re focused on.	Ɛno ne nea yɛde yɛn adwene asi so.
He didn’t owe me anything.	Na onni me ka biara.
None of us are perfect.	Obiara nni yɛn mu a ɔyɛ pɛ.
Besides, part of the music is not available for casual users.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, nnwom no fã bi nni hɔ mma wɔn a wɔde di dwuma kwa.
I’m really proud of you.	M’ani agye wo ho ankasa.
But it was there.	Nanso na ɛwɔ hɔ.
He did what he wanted.	Ɔyɛɛ nea ɔpɛ.
People react to it.	Nkurɔfo yɛ wɔn ade wɔ ho.
He is one of my favorites.	Ɔyɛ wɔn a m’ani gye wɔn ho paa no mu biako.
It’s a long shot.	Ɛyɛ tuo tenten bi.
I always do it.	Meyɛ bere nyinaa.
But no one really knows.	Nanso obiara nnim ankasa.
I say this is none of your business.	Meka sɛ eyi nyɛ wo asɛm biara.
Therefore, we conclude that.	Enti, yɛde yɛn ho to so sɛ.
He was the only one who did.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔyɛɛ saa.
Thank you for all you do, it’s amazing.	Meda wo ase wɔ nea woyɛ nyinaa ho, ɛyɛ nwonwa.
That’s why my dad decided to go.	Ɛno nti na me papa sii gyinae sɛ ɔbɛkɔ no.
But look at this.	Nanso hwɛ eyi.
Every time, it still makes me happy.	Bere biara a, ɛda so ara ma m’ani gye.
And what a play it was.	Na hwɛ sɛnea na ɛyɛ agoru.
Watch out for the dog.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ ɔkraman no ho.
Everything pointed in that direction.	Biribiara kyerɛɛ saa kwan no so.
I have a house now.	Mewɔ ofie mprempren.
This is very easy to do.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ.
I found a way.	Mihuu ɔkwan bi.
All that our people thing.	Saa nyinaa yɛn nkurɔfo no ade.
He doesn’t want help.	Ɔmpɛ mmoa.
You can actually float with it.	Wubetumi de abɔ nsu ankasa.
He does a good job of showing you how.	Ɔyɛ adwuma pa de kyerɛ wo sɛnea wobɛyɛ.
They were inexpensive at the time.	Saa bere no na wɔn bo nyɛ den.
I think I can get into this.	Misusuw sɛ metumi akɔ eyi mu.
I am not feeling well today.	Me ho nyɛ me den nnɛ.
All this stuff.	Saa ade yi nyinaa.
Let me think about this.	Ma minsusuw eyi ho.
It was the water itself.	Na ɛyɛ nsu no ankasa a wɔde hyɛ mu no.
Think about it now.	Susuw ho mprempren.
It’s really bad right now.	Ɛyɛ bɔne ankasa mprempren.
But it’s not there.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wɔ hɔ.
If you can talk about it.	Sɛ wubetumi aka ho asɛm a.
But there is still time.	Nanso bere da so ara wɔ hɔ.
However, I want to know more.	Nanso, mepɛ sɛ mihu pii.
And he knew everything.	Na onim biribiara.
Be careful!	Hwɛ yiye!
Let him go outside.	Ma no nkɔ abɔnten.
The current situation calls everything into question.	Mprempren tebea yi ma biribiara ho asɛm yɛ asɛm.
It was just like a movie.	Ná ɛte sɛ sini ara kwa.
But they are terrible.	Nanso wɔyɛ hu.
I say the same thing here.	Meka saa asɛm yi ara wɔ ha.
I was on the floor of my living room.	Ná mewɔ me dan mu fam.
However, you have another problem.	Nanso, wowɔ ɔhaw foforo.
Just remove it.	Yi fi hɔ ara kwa.
There's just too much traffic.	Ɛwɔ hɔ ara kwa sɛ kar pii dodo.
This should be empty.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nea hwee nni mu.
We had only one car.	Ná yɛwɔ kar biako pɛ.
I had to get used to it very quickly.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ me su ntɛmntɛm paa.
But the truth is something else.	Nanso nokware no yɛ biribi foforo.
I think, in any case, you should tell your father.	Misusuw sɛ, sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛsɛ sɛ woka kyerɛ wo papa.
Does he really have a reason to feel that way?	So ɔwɔ biribi a enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte nka saa ampa?
Your hat is on the ground.	Wo kyɛw no wɔ fam.
He will be here too.	Ɔno nso bɛba ha.
None of us really.	Yɛn mu biara ankasa.
There was no house.	Ná ofie biara nni hɔ.
I generally had the house to myself.	Mpɛn pii no, na mewɔ ofie no ma me ho.
A wonderful musical or cinematic masterpiece.	Nnwom anaa sini mu ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Even his wife used it.	Ne yere mpo de dii dwuma.
He did all the tests.	Ɔyɛɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow no nyinaa.
He was amazed at its simplicity.	Sɛnea na ɛyɛ mmerɛw no yɛɛ no ​​nwonwa.
He didn't know how to spend money on anything.	Ná onnim sɛnea ɔde sika bɛbɔ biribiara.
He had to make a plan.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nhyehyɛe.
It was a good job.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma pa.
That is terrible.	Ɛno yɛ hu yiye.
I touched both of them.	Mede me nsa kaa wɔn baanu nyinaa.
It all works fine.	Ne nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye.
It didn’t do anything.	Anyɛ hwee.
And everything went well.	Na biribiara kɔɔ yiye.
Keep walking.	Kɔ so nantew.
It’s not a good time for me.	Ɛnyɛ bere pa mma me.
Price is one room full.	Bo yɛ dan biako ma.
Maybe this is why the game surprised me so much.	Ebia eyi nti na agoru no maa me ho dwiriw me kɛse no.
I felt the same way.	Metee nka saa ara.
The system works very well.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛ adwuma yiye paa.
It’s quick.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm.
After yesterday .	Nnɛra akyi no .
For an earlier period.	Wɔ bere bi a edi kan mu.
That’s a job.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma.
That path no longer exists.	Saa kwan no nni hɔ bio.
It’s a party.	Ɛyɛ apontow bi.
And he's done it before like.	Na wayɛ no pɛn te sɛ.
He didn't know where he was.	Ná onnim baabi a ɔwɔ.
For each case,	Wɔ asɛm biara ho no, .
I would say that much for him too.	Me nso mɛka saa pii ama no.
However, it’s not my style.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ me su.
You’re interested in it.	W’ani gye ho.
At least for the first time among equals.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, nea edi kan wɔ nnipa a wɔyɛ pɛ mu.
But it didn’t matter.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ hwee.
This was new to me.	Ná eyi yɛ ade foforo ma me.
There was no food.	Ná aduan biara nni hɔ.
He glanced away quickly.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ baabi foforo ntɛmntɛm.
You should do the same.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ saa.
It’s so painful for me	Ɛyɛ me yaw paa
It should be more attractive.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ kɛse.
That worked for me.	Ɛno yɛɛ adwuma maa me.
This has caused many problems.	Eyi de ɔhaw ahorow pii aba.
That’s a lot of fun.	Ɛno yɛ anigye kɛse.
I think he is.	Misusuw sɛ ɔno.
I want to make the most of my time.	Mepɛ sɛ mede me bere di dwuma yiye.
People remember me.	Nkurɔfo kae me.
But everything else was on the table.	Nanso na biribiara a aka no wɔ pon no so.
Everything after this looks the same.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ eyi akyi no te sɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
Check it out before it’s too late.	Hwɛ ansa na aka akyi dodo.
First time for me and my kids.	Bere a edi kan ma me ne me mma no.
There are actually many, many more.	Pii pii wɔ hɔ ankasa.
I would really appreciate any help.	M’ani begye mmoa biara ho ankasa.
So don't lie to me anymore.	Enti nni atoro nkyerɛ me bio.
But it may not be that simple.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
This was a really important thing.	Ná eyi yɛ ade a ɛho hia ankasa.
It has always worked.	Ayɛ adwuma bere nyinaa.
I’m not sure why, but it’s the same.	Me nnim nea enti a ɛte saa, nanso ɛte saa ara.
He was not a participant.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu.
I have been playing this for the last few hours.	Mede nnɔnhwerew kakraa a atwam no abɔ eyi ahwɛ.
Probably in most that case.	Ebia wɔ dodow no ara mu no saa asɛm no.
One thing was certain.	Ná ade biako yɛ nokware.
I need to talk to you about some things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa fa nneɛma bi ho.
They were his.	Ná wɔyɛ ne de.
That’s pretty impressive.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
If you are inside.	Sɛ wo mu.
With the other group.	Ne kuw foforo no.
They are beautiful	Wɔyɛ fɛ
You can volunteer to do so.	Wubetumi de ne ho ama wayɛ saa.
But the police did.	Nanso polisifo no yɛɛ saa.
She was just amazing.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
I find her beautiful.	Mihu sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Do whatever you do.	Yɛ nea wobɛyɛ biara.
Say nothing.	Nka hwee.
The beauty of the city begins to amaze us.	Sɛnea kurow no ho yɛ fɛ no fi ase yɛ yɛn nwonwa.
Everything seems possible there.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye wɔ hɔ.
There is no need for a plan.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
Children are so wonderful.	Mmofra yɛ nwonwa yiye.
The team won.	Kuw no dii nkonim.
Be a real person.	Yɛ obi ankasa.
All we can control is how we act and what we do.	Nea yebetumi adi so ara ne sɛnea yɛyɛ yɛn ade ne nea yɛyɛ.
Most are excellent.	Dodow no ara yɛ nea eye sen biara.
That’s how it should be.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
I want another opportunity.	Mepɛ hokwan foforo.
He is filled with joy.	Anigye ahyɛ no ma.
I felt that strongly.	Metee nka saa denneennen.
I am very good to people.	Meyɛ nnipa a wɔyɛ papa ma me paa.
There may be many reasons for this.	Ebia nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
Not for many years.	Ɛnyɛ mfe pii ni.
Perhaps that was one of the reasons he was so popular.	Ebia ɛno ne ade biako nti a na wɔn ani gye ne ho kɛse no.
I knew it would work.	Ná minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
There is no one.	Obiara nni hɔ.
Many animals stay at night.	Mmoa pii tra hɔ anadwo.
All in all, check it out.	Ne nyinaa mu no, hwɛ mu.
His house was on the road, somehow.	Na ne fie wɔ kwan so, ɔkwan bi so.
Everyone is doing a lot of work.	Obiara reyɛ nnwuma pii.
It is a very interesting study.	Ɛyɛ adesua a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
Too bad for them though.	Ɛyɛ bɔne dodo ma wɔn de, nanso.
The same is true of us.	Saa ara na yɛn nso yɛ.
Can see him.	Tumi hu no.
And in the meantime.	Na wɔ saa bere yi mu.
His free day.	Ne da a ɔde ne ho no.
He doesn’t like that.	Ɔmpɛ saa asɛm no.
And not immediately.	Na ɛnyɛ ntɛm ara.
I doubt that would be easy.	Migye kyim sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I can’t see you like that.	Mintumi nhu wo saa.
Or good like.	Anaasɛ papa te sɛ.
I want you to know that you are not alone.	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu sɛ ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo.
A story that.	Asɛm bi a.
Not necessarily the best.	Ɛnyɛ nea eye sen biara ankasa.
His hands were full.	Ná ne nsa ayɛ ma.
They were very beautiful.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Me or them.	Me anaa wɔn.
That’s why it was brought to my attention.	Ɛno nti na wɔde baa m’adwene mu no.
There was someone inside.	Ná obi wɔ mu.
If there was, it would be really new.	Sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ a, anka ɛbɛyɛ foforo ankasa.
I lived where the money went.	Ná mete baabi a sika no kɔ.
But it’s a story.	Nanso ɛyɛ asɛm bi.
It’s that good.	Ɛyɛ papa saa.
The same mistake is not.	Mfomso koro no ara nyɛ.
I’m glad you’re there.	M’ani agye sɛ wowɔ hɔ.
He always speaks his mind.	Ɔka n’adwene bere nyinaa.
This was a terrible thing.	Ná eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu.
And not my dog.	Na ɛnyɛ me kraman no.
This was truly a beautiful day.	Na eyi yɛ da a ɛyɛ fɛ ampa.
They are very interested in it.	Wɔn ani gye ho yiye.
You can take care of him.	Wubetumi ahwɛ no so.
He brought it there.	Ɔde baa hɔ.
I agree with you that it’s a great movie.	Me ne wo yɛ adwene sɛ ɛyɛ sini kɛse.
To me, this is not wise.	Wɔ me fam no, eyi nyɛ nyansa.
However, the first few days.	Nanso, nna a edi kan no.
I share his fears.	Me ne no suro no bi.
I was surprised.	Meyɛɛ no ​​nwonwa.
It’s not good at all.	Ɛnyɛ papa koraa.
He had similar problems.	Ná ɔwɔ ɔhaw ahorow a ɛte saa ara.
Look at that idea.	Hwɛ saa adwene no.
He hurried to the door.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm kɔɔ ɔpon no ano.
The three ways below.	Ɔkwan abiɛsa a ɛwɔ ase no.
Our group of friends does a great job as it is.	Yɛn nnamfo kuw no yɛ adwuma kɛse sɛnea ɛte no.
Someone who was a good guy.	Obi a na ɔyɛ papa.
His mind was elsewhere.	Ná n’adwene wɔ baabi foforo.
Three strong points.	Nneɛma abiɛsa a ɛyɛ den.
Another surprise for you.	Ade foforo a ɛyɛ nwonwa ma wo.
But the test is only heating up.	Nanso sɔhwɛ no reyɛ hyew ara kwa.
Give me back the book .	Fa nhoma no san ma me .
Give things a chance.	Ma nneɛma nnya hokwan.
There may be a number of reasons.	Ebia nneɛma ahorow bi nti na ɛte saa.
This can be difficult and inconvenient for the user.	Eyi betumi ayɛ den na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw ama nea ɔde di dwuma no.
First, it’s too hot here.	Nea edi kan no, ɛyɛ hyew dodo wɔ ha.
They do terrible things.	Wɔyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ hu.
One is that risk testing is the strange name.	Biako ne sɛ asiane ho sɔhwɛ ne din a ɛyɛ nwonwa no.
He is like us.	Ɔte sɛ yɛn.
My hair is really long.	Me ti nhwi yɛ tenten ankasa.
Last year, it was easily my favorite of the weekend.	Afe a etwaam no, na ɛnyɛ den sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nea m’ani gye ho kɛse wɔ dapɛn awiei no mu.
The food chain is very complex.	Aduan a wɔde di dwuma no yɛ nea ɛyɛ den yiye.
You have to deal with them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne wɔn di nsɛm.
So it was immediately put on our team.	Enti wɔde too yɛn kuw no so ntɛm ara.
You offer the other person a drink.	Wode nsa bi ma onipa foforo no.
There was your mistake.	Na wo mfomso wɔ hɔ.
She likes that one too.	Ɔno nso ani gye saa biako no ho.
Time went on.	Bere kɔɔ so.
Tell people what you’ve done.	Ka nea woayɛ no kyerɛ nkurɔfo.
One point is important.	Asɛm biako ho hia.
I thought it was you.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ wo.
However, you will be relieved.	Nanso, wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
Neither figure had a head.	Ná mfonini abien no mu biara nni ti.
I really want to know how tall they are.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea wɔn tenten te ankasa.
You don’t have to think about it either.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wususuw ho nso.
I hope you are doing well.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ woreyɛ yiye.
It just looked really, really good.	Nea ɛte ara ne sɛ na ɛte sɛ nea eye ankasa, ankasa.
Use it to tell a story.	Fa ka asɛm bi.
I had food and water.	Ná mewɔ aduan ne nsu.
It was a really good job.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma pa ankasa.
If so, it was too late.	Sɛ saa a, na aka akyi dodo.
The exterior tells you nothing.	Abɔnten so no nkyerɛ wo hwee.
The idea fascinated him.	Adwene no maa n’ani gyee ho kɛse.
We can’t go on like that.	Yɛrentumi nkɔ so saa.
I really want to talk to you.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa ankasa.
Things that really matter.	Nneɛma a ɛho hia ankasa.
But this was worse.	Nanso na eyi yɛ bɔne sen saa.
I talk to dad on the phone most days.	Me ne papa kasa wɔ telefon so nna dodow no ara.
People know that.	Nkurɔfo nim saa.
The situation was simple.	Ná tebea no yɛ mmerɛw.
The work took hours.	Adwuma no gyee nnɔnhwerew pii.
But he knew it.	Nanso na onim.
They were his friends.	Ná wɔyɛ ne nnamfo.
Each of us.	Yɛn mu biara.
Those days seem to be over.	Ɛte sɛ nea saa nna no aba awiei.
It was one game.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru biako.
I think the rest will come.	Misusuw sɛ nea aka no bɛba.
He didn't know how it worked.	Ná onnim sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma.
After this meeting.	Wɔ nhyiam yi akyi.
Nevertheless, generalizations may be possible.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ebia nsɛm a wɔka no nyinaa betumi ayɛ yiye.
And you have to do that.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
There is absolutely everything in it, and there is absolutely everything in it.	Biribiara wɔ mu koraa, na ɛwɔ biribiara mu koraa.
This was almost so close.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na eyi bɛn no saa.
He put his days to work.	Ɔde ne nna no hyɛɛ adwuma mu.
I think you will too.	Misusuw sɛ wo nso wobɛyɛ saa.
Please save me now!	Mesrɛ wo, gye me nkwa seesei!
It had run so well.	Ná atu mmirika yiye saa.
It’s not another game.	Ɛnyɛ agoru foforo biara.
It will be exciting.	Ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
As long as you are being smart about it.	Bere tenten a woreyɛ nyansa wɔ ho no.
But we	Nanso yɛn .
I thought this worked, a lot of people didn’t.	Misusuwii sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma, nnipa pii anyɛ adwuma.
The boy is here.	Abarimaa no wɔ ha.
That was the case in school.	Ná ɛte saa wɔ sukuu mu.
I cannot agree with them on this.	Mintumi ne wɔn nyɛ adwene wɔ eyi mu.
He is only interested in money.	Sika nkutoo na n’ani gye ho.
There is not enough money.	Sika a ɛdɔɔso nni hɔ.
You are not what they are.	Wonyɛ nea wɔyɛ.
No two moments in time are the same.	Bere mu bere abien biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ pɛ.
It’s not my problem.	Ɛnyɛ me haw.
He drove fast.	Ɔde kar no kɔɔ ntɛmntɛm.
I knew what it was.	Ná minim nea ɛyɛ.
It is a beautiful house.	Ɛyɛ ofie a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Most people have sleep problems.	Nnipa dodow no ara wɔ nna ho haw.
This is your job.	Eyi ne wo adwuma no.
I think we had enough.	Misusuw sɛ na yɛwɔ nea ɛdɔɔso.
I don’t like it either.	M’ani nnye ho nso.
I can't hear any of them in it.	Mintumi nte wɔn mu biara wɔ mu.
You know you want to.	Wunim sɛ wopɛ.
And each day only solves one problem at a time.	Na da biara di ɔhaw biako pɛ ho dwuma bere koro mu.
To me, that’s important for something.	Wɔ me fam no, ɛno ho hia ma biribi.
Many many many.	Pii pii pii.
Maybe it’s all of those things.	Ebia ɛyɛ saa nneɛma no nyinaa.
If you do that.	Sɛ woyɛ saa a.
This is the most important one.	Eyi ne nea ɛho hia sen biara.
This man is handsome, but strong.	Saa ɔbarima yi ho yɛ fɛ, nanso ne ho yɛ den.
We can go home.	Yebetumi akɔ fie.
I don’t know that.	Minnim saa.
You need to think about that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw saa asɛm no ho.
But there is another side to it.	Nanso ne fã foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
I knew this was possible.	Ná minim sɛ eyi betumi aba.
I look around the city.	Mehwɛ kurow no mu.
We are someone.	Yɛyɛ obi.
But that’s me.	Nanso ɛno ne me.
There are not many job opportunities here.	Adwuma hokwan pii nni ha.
The kids loved it.	Mmofra no ani gyee ho.
We need to run tests on you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde sɔhwɛ ahorow tu mmirika wɔ wo so.
He knew we were there.	Ná onim sɛ yɛwɔ hɔ.
I felt the joy in it.	Metee anigye a ɛwɔ mu no nka.
No cars, no cars.	Kar biara nni hɔ, kar biara nni hɔ.
The rest of the house was filled with paintings.	Ná mfonini ahorow a wɔde yɛ ade ahyɛ ofie no fã a aka no ma.
He looked at me with interest.	Ɔde anigye hwɛɛ me.
Don’t be strong.	Mma wonyɛ den.
It’s still hot here most of the year.	Ɛda so ara yɛ hyew wɔ ha afe no fã kɛse no ara.
He could have anything now.	Ná obetumi anya biribiara mprempren.
He glanced down at his feet.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ne nan ase.
It was supposed to be an interesting game.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ agoru a ɛyɛ anigye.
His mother needed a lot of money to support her children.	Ná ne maame hia sika pii de ahwɛ ne mma.
You have to believe you have everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye di sɛ wowɔ biribiara.
And he did this in just three years.	Na ɔyɛɛ eyi wɔ mfe abiɛsa pɛ mu.
Our eyes watered.	Yɛn ani so yɛɛ nsu.
She was beautiful, this girl, but not much fun.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ, abeawa yi, nanso na ɛnyɛ anigye pii.
I had money and a gun.	Ná mewɔ sika ne tuo.
Take a moment to think about that.	Fa bere tiaa bi susuw saa asɛm no ho.
And this is true.	Na eyi yɛ nokware.
It looks pretty cool.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I'll bring him here with me.	Mede no bɛba ha ne me.
I’m excited.	M’ani agye.
One of us needs to speak!	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn mu biako kasa!
The person just wasn’t there.	Ná onipa no nni hɔ ara kwa.
He was working on himself.	Ná ɔreyɛ ne ho adwuma.
I wasn’t there for them.	Na minni hɔ mma wɔn.
I had no plans.	Ná minni nhyehyɛe biara.
Another reason is the complexity of the human mind.	Ade foforo nti a ɛte saa ne sɛnea onipa adwene mu yɛ den no.
But, please don’t tell anyone.	Nanso, mesrɛ wo, nka nkyerɛ obiara.
He seemed to know what not to do.	Ɛte sɛ nea na onim nea ɔnyɛ.
It’s hard to.	Ɛyɛ den.
No one ever said anything.	Obiara anka hwee da.
He leaned in even closer.	Ɔde ne ho too mu bɛn no kɛse mpo.
It is a very powerful force.	Ɛyɛ tumi a ano yɛ den yiye.
He had this one.	Ná ɔwɔ eyi.
Lots of time to think about it.	Bere pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
His presence consumed most of the room.	Nea na ɔwɔ hɔ no dii dan no mu kɛse.
He didn’t seem interested.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani nnye ho.
I think you will be fine.	Misusuw sɛ wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
It works fine for the most part.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu.
And so it still is today.	Na saa ara na ɛda so ara te nnɛ.
What are you doing.	Woyɛ dɛn.
He was involved in it.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
It’s a huge mistake.	Ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
This method works well.	Saa kwan yi yɛ adwuma yiye.
There weren’t many opportunities, just like that.	Na hokwan pii nni hɔ, na na ɛte saa ara.
But somehow it hurts, too.	Nanso ɔkwan bi so no ɛyɛ yaw, nso.
All the details are available here.	Nsɛm no nyinaa wɔ ha.
Now the problem seems to be gone.	Seesei ɛte sɛ nea ɔhaw no afi hɔ.
Please don’t come to me.	Mesrɛ wo, mma me nkyɛn.
I have a real problem with that kind of thing.	Mewɔ ɔhaw ankasa wɔ ade a ɛte saa ho.
I just kind of touched it.	Mede me nsa kaa mu kɛkɛ wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
There is no one left.	Obiara nni hɔ bio.
That’s not what it is.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea.
Just real good food.	Aduan pa a ɛyɛ nokware ara kwa.
He was on it.	Ná ɔwɔ so.
Tests can be very difficult.	Sɔhwɛ ahorow betumi ayɛ den yiye.
This was impossible.	Ná eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
This time it’s simple.	Saa bere yi de ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Always the best price for the best products.	Bere nyinaa bo a eye sen biara ma nneɛma a eye sen biara.
You are one very beautiful girl.	Woyɛ abeawa biako a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
It was almost two.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ abien.
Ultimately, complex systems emerge from simple materials.	Awiei koraa no, nhyehyɛe ahorow a ɛyɛ den fi nneɛma a ɛnyɛ den mu ba.
It was not difficult in any way.	Ná ɛnyɛ den wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
I really, really like him.	M’ani gye ne ho paa, paa.
Just think about it for a moment.	Susuw ho kakra kɛkɛ.
You do everything you have to do.	Woyɛ biribiara a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
That was another thing.	Ná ɛno nso yɛ ade foforo.
So little of everything these days.	Enti biribiara kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ nnansa yi.
I could use one.	Ná metumi de biako adi dwuma.
Nobody wants the truth.	Obiara mpɛ nokware no.
This is really easy.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
Do anything about it.	Yɛ ho biribi biara.
His quick thinking saved the day.	N’adwene a ɔde susuw nneɛma ho ntɛmntɛm no gyee da no nkwa.
As if the situation isn’t difficult enough.	Te sɛ nea tebea no nyɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ.
They are children.	Wɔyɛ mmofra.
He has difficulty concentrating.	Ɛyɛ den ma no sɛ ɔde n’adwene besi biribi so.
It wasn’t great though.	Na ɛnyɛ kɛse nanso.
I knew you would taste that this way.	Na minim sɛ wobɛka saa ahwɛ wɔ saa kwan yi so.
Early.	Ntɛm.
People walk a lot in this city.	Nkurɔfo nantew kɛse wɔ kurow yi mu.
All cars are faster now.	Kar nyinaa yɛ ntɛmntɛm mprempren.
This was an interesting story.	Ná eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
I put the kitten to bed.	Mede ɔkraman ba no too mpa so.
So that was the way it was going.	Enti na saa na na ɛrekɔ so.
Things went on like this for days.	Nneɛma kɔɔ so saa nna pii.
How wonderful it is.	Sɛnea ɛyɛ nwonwa no.
They are a big part of it.	Wɔyɛ ne fã kɛse.
He built it with his own hands.	Ɔde ne nsa na esii.
But that would be a mistake.	Nanso ɛno bɛyɛ mfomso.
It’s really great.	Ɛyɛ kɛse ankasa.
We are friends too.	Yɛn nso yɛyɛ nnamfo.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
That might be for the best.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
Now it is obvious how to use it.	Seesei ɛda adi sɛnea wɔde bedi dwuma.
I thought about my room.	Misusuw me dan no ho.
Good luck!	Ti pa!
The phone rang loudly.	Telefon no bɔɔ denneennen.
I did the same thing.	Me nso meyɛɛ saa.
He is in great shape.	Ɔwɔ tebea kɛse mu.
Nothing should happen to him.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ biribiara to no.
He actually did that.	Ɔyɛɛ saa ankasa.
It was an expensive car.	Ná ɛyɛ kar a ne bo yɛ den.
I know you will.	Minim sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
Fortunately, this is nothing new.	Nea eye ne sɛ, eyi nyɛ ade foforo.
Look outside.	Hwɛ abɔnten.
I have no idea how you do it.	Minni sɛnea woyɛ no ho adwene biara.
There’s a lot of it.	Ɛho pii.
This is one of those things.	Eyi yɛ saa nneɛma no mu biako.
I know what he looks like.	Minim sɛnea ɔte.
Do we really have to sign the petition?	So ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde yɛn nsa hyɛ krataa no ase ankasa?
Every year just gets better.	Afe biara yɛ yiye ara kwa.
This promises to be a fun morning.	Eyi hyɛ bɔ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ anɔpa a ɛyɛ anigye.
Those two things need to be done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa nneɛma abien no.
I really wanted to.	Ná mepɛ ankasa.
You know what’s out there.	Wunim nea ɛwɔ abɔnten hɔ.
I think everyone knows that.	Misusuw sɛ obiara nim saa.
People like fakes here.	Nkurɔfo ani gye atoro nneɛma ho wɔ ha.
Keep your eyes peeled.	Kɔ so hwɛ yiye.
There would be more when this is over.	Anka pii bɛyɛ bere a eyi aba awiei no.
The two were a perfect pair.	Ná wɔn baanu no yɛ baanu a wɔyɛ pɛ.
I don’t want kids anymore.	Me mpɛ mmofra bio.
A few years ago, the situation was less difficult.	Mfe kakraa bi a atwam ni no, na tebea no nyɛ den pii.
It’s not his fault.	Ɛnyɛ ne mfomso.
Maybe it was a mistake.	Ebia na ɛyɛ mfomso.
But it’s not the case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛte saa.
There is no cost to it.	Ɛho ka biara nni ho.
Check the prices.	Hwɛ nneɛma bo a ɛwɔ hɔ no.
I don’t think anyone can do that.	Minsusuw sɛ obiara betumi ayɛ saa.
It was a pain in the ass.	Ná ɛyɛ me yaw.
Nor is it the last.	Ɛnyɛ nea etwa to nso.
That’s really what we have here.	Ɛno ne nea yɛwɔ ha ankasa.
He didn't even know what time it was anymore.	Ná onnim bere a ɛyɛ mpo bio.
He wants to be the big shot now.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ tuo kɛse no mprempren.
And even if there is, look at it my way.	Na sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ mpo a, hwɛ no me kwan so.
I don’t care about their music.	Wɔn nnwom no mfa me ho.
No speaking animals.	Mmoa a wɔka kasa biara nni hɔ.
I’d love to say they were perfect, but they weren’t.	M’ani begye ho sɛ mɛka sɛ na wɔyɛ pɛ, nanso na ɛnte saa.
See me there in one.	Hwɛ me wɔ hɔ wɔ biako mu.
Look out the window.	Hwɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
So, they are perfect.	Enti, wɔyɛ pɛ.
Not spectacular but good enough.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa nanso eye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I’m very impressed with this car.	M’ani agye saa kar yi ho yiye.
A dog nibbled on my leg.	Ɔkraman bi de ne nsa bɔɔ me nan so.
It was absolutely beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ koraa.
So do you, too.	Saa ara na wo nso woyɛ.
I just drove over them.	Mede kar no faa wɔn so ara kwa.
There is no real joy either.	Anigye ankasa biara nni hɔ nso.
He wasn't pretty at all.	Ná ne ho nyɛ fɛ koraa.
So it was exciting.	Enti na ɛyɛ anigye.
Please thank your mother for me.	Mesrɛ wo, da wo maame ase wɔ me ho.
We have good water.	Yɛwɔ nsu pa.
The reason is not immediately apparent.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no ntumi nhu ntɛm ara.
So, tell me about yourself.	Enti, ka wo ho asɛm kyerɛ me.
You can also do this with both feet together.	Wubetumi nso ayɛ eyi bere a wode wo nan abien no nyinaa abɔ mu.
It is important not to overdo it.	Ɛho hia sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ade tra so.
I hope we become friends.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ yɛbɛyɛ nnamfo.
Someone needs to do something about that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ saa asɛm no ho biribi.
I’m happy here.	M’ani agye wɔ ha.
He might do the same thing.	Ebia na ɔbɛyɛ ade koro no ara.
Illustration of the object.	Ade no ho mfonini.
I think it’s true.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
He doesn't know why.	Onnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
So he worked for them.	Enti ɔyɛɛ adwuma maa wɔn.
He wrapped his arms around her.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne mu.
Check it out though.	Hwɛ mu nanso.
It’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Everyone can tell the dog is still there.	Obiara betumi ahu sɛ ɔkraman no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
It seems harmless enough.	Ɛte sɛ nea asiane biara nni ho sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He was obviously planning to go somewhere.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔreyɛ nhyehyɛe akɔ baabi.
I want you to talk to me.	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me kasa.
At least for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, me.
If you already know, great.	Sɛ wunim dedaw a, ɛyɛ kɛse.
Really bad stuff.	Nneɛma bɔne ankasa.
The ultimate test of its kind.	Sɔhwɛ a etwa to a ɛte saa.
He brought us there.	Ɔde yɛn baa hɔ.
This is already amazing.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa dedaw.
I'm just not immediate.	Menyɛ ntɛm ara kɛkɛ.
While in truth .	Bere a ɛwɔ nokware mu no .
But this could spell trouble here.	Nanso eyi betumi akyerɛ ɔhaw wɔ ha.
He had the time.	Ná ɔwɔ bere no.
He was a warm-hearted man.	Ná ne ho yɛ hyew.
No one seemed to be able to think of much to add.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obiara ntumi nsusuw nsɛm pii ho a ɔbɛka ho.
I do, sorry.	Meyɛ saa, paa kyɛw.
Much more on this tomorrow.	Pii pii wɔ eyi ho ɔkyena.
That hadn’t been so bad.	Ná ɛno anyɛ bɔne saa.
Mom said that.	Maame kae saa.
In each case, we could have done much better.	Wɔ asɛm biara mu no, anka yebetumi ayɛ nea eye sen saa koraa.
He would make one for her.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ biako ama no.
Again, thank you very much.	Bio nso, meda mo ase pii.
If something is wrong, can you tell me?	Sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye a, so wubetumi aka akyerɛ me?
And he had it, too.	Na na ɔwɔ nso.
Hope you are doing good so far.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ woreyɛ papa de besi nnɛ.
That is the conclusion we reached in this article.	Saa na yɛde baa awiei wɔ asɛm yi mu.
He agrees with me.	Ɔne me yɛ adwene.
This no longer works.	Eyi nyɛ adwuma bio.
He was getting bigger.	Ná ɔreyɛ kɛse.
Most of the time, he is free.	Mpɛn pii no, ɔde ne ho.
He knows he will be late for an important meeting.	Onim sɛ ɔbɛka akyi wɔ nhyiam bi a ɛho hia ase.
I feel the same way.	Me nso mete nka.
My time is up.	Me bere aba awiei.
Every time is perfect.	Bere biara a ɛyɛ pɛ.
I think that was exciting for them.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno yɛ anigye maa wɔn.
Like even more food.	Te sɛ aduan pii mpo.
He took most of the tests.	Ɔyɛɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow no mu dodow no ara.
He takes her with him.	Ɔde no ka ne ho.
But we can’t do that.	Nanso yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
A lot of what?	Dɛn mu pii?
He looks a lot like me, if you think about it.	Ɔte sɛ me yiye, sɛ wususuw ho a.
Neither of us said much in the car.	Yɛn mu biara anka pii wɔ kar no mu.
I have a passion for both.	Mewɔ nneɛma abien no nyinaa ho anigye.
Full details of some offers are below.	Nneɛma bi a wɔde ma no ho nsɛm nyinaa wɔ ase hɔ.
No one does it right.	Obiara nyɛ no yiye.
I don’t want to work anywhere else.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma wɔ baabi foforo biara.
A moment to think about.	Bere tiaa bi a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
Keep telling yourself that.	Kɔ so ka saa kyerɛ wo ho.
Look at the timing!	Hwɛ bere a wɔde ama no yiye!
In my opinion, the story is not true.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no, asɛm no nyɛ nokware.
That is not true at all.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware koraa.
No one has an obviously good time.	Obiara nni bere a ɛda adi sɛ ɛyɛ papa.
We do this many times in the past.	Yɛyɛ eyi mpɛn pii wɔ bere a atwam no mu.
They seem to like me.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani gye me ho.
Great fear.	Suro kɛse.
Something is always wrong in the stable.	Biribi yɛ bɔne bere nyinaa wɔ mmoa dan no mu.
I can’t control myself anymore.	Mintumi nni me ho so bio.
However, this does not seem to matter to us.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea eyi nyɛ ade a ɛho hia wɔ yɛn ani so.
That had been a lie.	Ná ɛno ayɛ atoro.
I just have no idea.	Minni adwene biara kɛkɛ.
That’s why we need to do something about it.	Ɛno nti na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi no.
It’s a very good group of people.	Ɛyɛ nnipa pa paa kuw.
Do those two things.	Yɛ saa nneɛma abien.
So, you know, he makes a big deal.	Enti, wunim, ɔyɛ asɛm kɛse bi.
The way you do it.	Sɛnea woyɛ no.
He barely does it his first two years.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔnyɛ ne mfe abien a edi kan no.
There is no one like him.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔte sɛ ɔno.
Everyone was impressed.	Obiara ani gyee ho.
I see it now.	Mihu mprempren.
Know your opportunities.	Hu hokwan ahorow a wowɔ.
I went to a house party with a couple of friends.	Me ne me nnamfo baanu bi kɔɔ ofie apontow bi ase.
He wasn’t interested.	Ná n’ani nnye ho.
Do your homework.	Yɛ wo fie nnwuma.
You see it in their faces.	Wuhu wɔ wɔn anim.
This all fell apart.	Eyi nyinaa hwee ase.
So, the test will be very difficult.	Enti, sɔhwɛ no bɛyɛ den yiye.
That would be really great.	Ɛno bɛyɛ kɛse ankasa.
This was not true.	Ná eyi nyɛ nokware.
You know what they say.	Wunim nea wɔka.
He could do anything.	Ná obetumi ayɛ biribiara.
I'm really enjoying them!.	M'ani agye wɔn ho ankasa!.
In the meantime, let’s help these people.	Saa bere yi, momma mmoa saa nkurɔfo yi.
At least not perfectly.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nea edi mũ.
You could do anything.	Ná wubetumi ayɛ biribiara.
So is yours.	Saa ara na wo de no.
He spent most of his time outdoors.	Ná ɔde ne bere fã kɛse no ara tra abɔnten.
In this case, timing flexibility is crucial.	Wɔ eyi mu no, bere a wɔde yɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no ho hia yiye.
I’m so in love with him.	M’ani gye ne ho paa.
It was there before.	Ná ɛwɔ hɔ kan.
Like last night.	Te sɛ anadwo a etwaam no.
I hope it works out.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
He didn’t want her.	Ná ɔmpɛ no.
I can’t even believe it works.	Me ntumi nnye nni mpo sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
This time, however, he was not alone.	Nanso, saa bere yi de, ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na na ɔwɔ hɔ.
The children's story is true.	Mmofra no asɛm no yɛ nokware.
This is a real thing.	Eyi yɛ ade ankasa.
Do check it out.	Yɛ hwɛ.
Your hands are on me.	Wo nsa ka me.
It’s that simple!.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa!.
I can be good.	Metumi ayɛ papa.
This is possible today.	Eyi betumi ayɛ yiye nnɛ.
In very few cases it works.	Wɔ nsɛm kakraa bi pɛ mu no ɛyɛ adwuma.
You have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I can’t think of the last time that happened.	Mintumi nsusuw bere a etwa to a esii saa no ho.
So it must be true.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
Nor was it then.	Saa ara na ɛnyɛ saa saa bere no.
Just go out and have fun.	Fi adi kɛkɛ na gye w’ani.
I look down and see that mine is the same.	Mehwɛ fam na mihu sɛ me de no nso te saa ara.
Did you have a.	So na wowɔ.
But there is still work to be done.	Nanso adwuma da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Many of them are like that.	Wɔn mu pii te saa.
He had an idea.	Ná ɔwɔ adwene bi.
That's not my street.	Ɛno nyɛ me abɔnten so.
I’m very pleased with the results.	M’ani gye nea afi mu aba no ho yiye.
I see this every day.	Mihu eyi da biara da.
Be thankful for what you have.	Da ase wɔ nea wowɔ no ho.
I’m interested in work.	M’ani gye adwuma ho.
That’s quite a lot of money.	Ɛno yɛ sika pii koraa.
You can put anything in it.	Wubetumi de biribiara ahyɛ mu.
I don’t care what anyone else has to say.	Nea obi foforo wɔ ka no mfa me ho.
But you will feel better in a few days.	Nanso wo ho bɛtɔ wo wɔ nna kakraa bi akyi.
That is the real point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no ankasa.
A house is a house.	Ofie yɛ fie.
It was an amazing performance.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
My cell was gone.	Ná me afiase dan no nni hɔ.
I knew him well.	Ná minim no yiye.
I stepped aside slightly.	Mede me nan sii nkyɛn kakra.
The test was easy.	Ná sɔhwɛ no yɛ mmerɛw.
No one knows for sure.	Obiara nnim no yiye.
What you said.	Nea wokae no.
For us, nothing is more important.	Yɛn fam no, biribiara nni hɔ a ɛho hia sen saa.
It’s our business.	Ɛyɛ yɛn asɛm.
But that’s only part of the story.	Nanso ɛno yɛ asɛm no fã bi kɛkɛ.
There must be a.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
If the book does not come to him.	Sɛ nhoma no amma ne nkyɛn a.
I couldn’t control it.	Ná mintumi nni so.
Otherwise there is no need to use this method.	Anyɛ saa a ɛho nhia sɛ wɔde saa kwan yi di dwuma.
But you may have the same.	Nanso ebia wowɔ saa ara.
He knew them.	Ná onim wɔn.
It just has to be beautiful.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa.
It’s important for a boy like that.	Ɛho hia ma abarimaa a ɔte saa.
I live in it most of the year.	Mete mu afe no fã kɛse no ara.
Whether this occurs in humans.	Sɛ́ ebia eyi ba nnipa mu anaa.
We do that with words.	Yɛde nsɛm na ɛyɛ saa.
But this was only half the story.	Nanso na eyi yɛ asɛm no fã pɛ.
I did it so that I could work here.	Meyɛɛ no ​​sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a mɛyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Ná onim nea ɔreyɛ no yiye.
The status quo doesn’t work.	Tebea a ɛwɔ hɔ no ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
I don’t like going out with anyone.	M’ani nnye ho sɛ me ne obiara bɛkɔ abɔnten.
And if you’re happy, he’ll tell you.	Na sɛ w’ani gye a, ɔbɛka akyerɛ wo.
It was the end of the season.	Ná ɛyɛ bere no awiei.
Or something similar.	Anaasɛ biribi a ɛte saa ara.
Walk it every day, anyway.	Nantew so da biara, ɔkwan biara so.
Cold winter days are terrible.	Awɔw bere mu nna a awɔw wom no yɛ hu.
We are perfect.	Yɛyɛ pɛ.
This recipe is very simple.	Saa aduan yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
But this must be done.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi.
He leaned closer to her.	Ɔde ne ho too mu bɛn no.
So in many ways.	Enti ɔkwan pii so.
But this is a really big deal.	Nanso eyi yɛ ade kɛse ankasa.
All three models performed very poorly.	Mfonini abiɛsa no nyinaa anyɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
Something was going to happen.	Ná biribi bɛba.
This is very important to many people.	Eyi ho hia nnipa pii paa.
It was too expensive.	Ná ne bo yɛ den dodo.
They are perfect.	Wɔyɛ pɛ.
Or for the sake of money.	Anaasɛ sika nti.
It’s for everyone, not just a few.	Ɛyɛ ma obiara, ɛnyɛ nnipa kakraa bi.
That was also exciting.	Ná ɛno nso yɛ anigye.
I knew he knew everything about me.	Ná minim sɛ onim me ho biribiara.
He is in the car.	Ɔwɔ kar no mu.
Everything else seemed okay.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara a aka no nyɛ hwee.
I do this for fun.	Meyɛ eyi de gye m’ani.
You’ll be relieved.	Wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
I am here for this.	Mewɔ ha ma eyi.
Would anyone like to tell me what’s going on?	So obi bɛpɛ sɛ ɔka nea ɛrekɔ so kyerɛ me?
It’s all that way.	Ɛyɛ saa kwan no nyinaa so.
Which is his right.	Nea ɛyɛ ne hokwan.
There was nothing new in this.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni eyi mu.
Every night of the week.	Dapɛn no mu anadwo biara.
But not in the prison itself.	Nanso ɛnyɛ afiase no ankasa mu.
They had to practice and practice every day.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu na wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu da biara.
But he wasn’t.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ saa.
You need to know how to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu sɛnea wobɛyɛ.
I could have seen the dates that next week.	Anka metumi ahu nna no saa dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
But I can’t make it work.	Nanso mintumi mma ɛnyɛ adwuma.
Long live him!	Nkwa tenten mma no!
We exist to work on ourselves.	Yɛwɔ hɔ sɛ yɛbɛyɛ yɛn ho adwuma.
He doesn’t hear that either.	Ɔno nso nte saa asɛm no.
He’s going with me.	Ɔne me rekɔ.
You know, just do it.	Wunim, yɛ no ara kwa.
It’s water and it’s important.	Ɛyɛ nsu na ɛho hia.
You can’t understand it.	Worentumi nte ase.
Walk away right now.	Nantew kɔ mprempren ara.
All that power.	Saa tumi no nyinaa.
Just not on our timeline.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn bere nhyehyɛe no so kɛkɛ.
No one knew anything.	Ná obiara nnim hwee.
I didn’t want to do this.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi.
You see the problem here.	Wuhu ɔhaw no wɔ ha.
It feels like him.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɔno.
Another person sitting by a window played a song.	Obi foforo a ɔte mfɛnsere bi ho no bɔɔ dwom bi.
There was so much in the food.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ aduan no mu.
How do they do it?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na wɔyɛ?
I don’t have that kind of opinion.	Minni adwene a ɛte saa.
He would be the first.	Ná ɔno na ɔbɛyɛ nea odi kan.
It’s first hand.	Ɛyɛ nsa a edi kan.
I don’t want to be anyone else.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ obi foforo biara.
Spend as much time with him as you can.	Fa bere pii ne no di dwuma sɛnea wubetumi biara.
On me this first time.	Wɔ me so saa bere a edi kan yi.
So, it’s that good.	Enti, eye saa.
But that’s not the whole story.	Nanso ɛnyɛ asɛm no nyinaa ne no.
Obviously, that’s your favorite.	Ɛda adi sɛ, ɛno ne nea w’ani gye ho paa.
Don’t do that thing.	Mma wonyɛ saa ade no.
This is not ideal.	Eyi nyɛ ade a eye sen biara.
That’s not a bad thing.	Ɛno nyɛ ade bɔne.
A few years.	Mfe kakraa bi.
There was nothing else to do.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Thanks again for the interest.	Meda wo ase bio wɔ anigye no ho.
Someone else can fill them.	Obi foforo betumi ahyɛ wɔn ma.
Just give me some time.	Ma me bere kakra kɛkɛ.
The police look into it.	Polisifo no hwɛ mu.
I totally disagree with him.	Me ne no nyɛ adwene koraa.
And he had it.	Na na ɔwɔ.
I never knew him so happy.	Minnim no da sɛ n’ani gye saa.
It was still early yet.	Ná ɛda so ara yɛ ntɛm de besi nnɛ.

It’s a thrill.	Ɛyɛ anigye.
He employed them.	Ɔde wɔn yɛɛ adwuma.

Don't say that.	Nka saa.
You told them.	Woka kyerɛɛ wɔn.
But the sin doesn’t end there.	Nanso bɔne no nkɔ awiei wɔ hɔ.
This doesn’t mean anything.	Eyi nkyerɛ hwee.
That group fell apart a long time ago.	Saa kuw no hwee ase bere tenten a atwam ni.
That was a little difficult.	Ná ɛno yɛ den kakra.
I was a man now.	Ná meyɛ ɔbarima mprempren.
Maybe you want him to be a boy.	Ebia wopɛ sɛ ɔyɛ abarimaa a ɔyɛ ɔbarima.
He was very involved in this.	Na ɔde ne ho ahyɛ eyi mu kɛse.
People want to invest elsewhere.	Nkurɔfo pɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn sika hyɛ baabi foforo.
I don’t know what it is.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ.
She was indeed beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ ampa.
Pretend, pretend, pretend.	Yɛ wo ho sɛ, yɛ wo ho sɛ, yɛ wo ho sɛ.
None of you have anyone.	Mo mu biara nni obiara.
There must have been something really strong in those people.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na biribi a ano yɛ den ankasa wɔ saa nkurɔfo no mu.
I wanted to know how you were doing.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea wo ho te.
The cold meant nothing.	Ná awɔw no nkyerɛ hwee.
It’s not much.	Ɛnyɛ pii.
His hands curve towards her.	Ne nsa bɔ ne ho kɔ ne nkyɛn.
I don't know how it all works.	Minnim sɛnea ne nyinaa yɛ adwuma.
It was always a big deal with the kids.	Ná ɛyɛ ade kɛse bere nyinaa wɔ mmofra no ho.
That’s the most beautiful thing.	Ɛno ne ade a ɛyɛ fɛ sen biara.
I didn’t want much.	Ná mempɛ pii.
That’s what he wanted.	Saa na na ɔpɛ.
I want to be strong.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ den.
This is like planning anything.	Eyi te sɛ nea woreyɛ nhyehyɛe biara.
This incident happened last week.	Saa asɛm yi sii wɔ dapɛn a etwaam no mu.
It should not be used.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma.
That would have been better.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
It was very impressive.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
I want that for all my children.	Mepɛ saa ma me mma nyinaa.
Put it this way.	Fa ka no saa kwan yi so.
It was a total disaster!	Ná ɛyɛ asiane koraa!
I was so excited.	Ná m’ani agye yiye.
There’s some truth to that, and that’s not a problem.	Nokware bi wɔ saa asɛm no mu, na ɛno nyɛ ɔhaw.
The same is true of music.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nnwom ho.
And he was there, too.	Na ɔno nso wɔ hɔ.
You bring them back.	Wo de wɔn san ba.
She is her mother’s age.	Ɔyɛ ne maame mfe.
We do have a problem.	Yɛwɔ ɔhaw bi ampa.
I just want to make some points.	Mepɛ sɛ meka nsɛm bi ho asɛm kɛkɛ.
I always feel like something or someone is next to me.	Bere nyinaa mete nka sɛ biribi anaa obi wɔ me nkyɛn.
It was very difficult for him.	Ná ɛyɛ den yiye ma no.
It is very large.	Ɛyɛ kɛse paa.
Time has passed.	Bere atwam.
They clapped their hands happily.	Wɔde anigye bɔɔ wɔn nsa.
He is not a terrible person.	Ɔnyɛ onipa a ne ho yɛ hu.
I look at that as that was me.	Mehwɛ saa sɛnea na ɛno ne me no.
It was easier this time.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa bere yi.
His mother has simple tastes.	Ne maame wɔ nneɛma a n’ani gye ho a ɛnyɛ den.
The results are out there.	Nea afi mu aba no wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
After that, everyone got something to eat.	Ɛno akyi no, obiara nyaa biribi di.
Cold temperatures, cold people.	Awɔw hyew, awɔw nnipa.
How to do things with that.	Sɛnea wɔde sɛ yɛ nneɛma bi.
Books are expensive.	Nhoma ahorow bo yɛ den.
She is a very nice person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
It is said that most children love animals.	Wɔka sɛ mmofra dodow no ara ani gye mmoa ho.
Work from home part-time.	Yɛ adwuma fi fie adwuma a wɔde bere fã yɛ.
And everything but him.	Na biribiara ka ho gye ɔno nkutoo.
He's doing fine with it.	Ɔreyɛ yiye wɔ ho.
There is always traffic through this road.	Bere nyinaa kar fa kwan yi so ma.
In a short period of time.	Wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
But one thing is for sure.	Nanso ade biako yɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
Only what I can enjoy.	Nea metumi anya mu anigye nkutoo.
Obiara is not here.	Obiara nte ha.
The story wasn’t good.	Ná asɛm no nyɛ papa.
Even now, it doesn’t work for them.	Mprempren mpo, ɛnyɛ adwuma mma wɔn.
I'm just looking forward to it.	Mehwɛ kwan kɛkɛ.
Just what is happening.	Nea ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
But it’s not your business.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wo asɛm.
All ingredients must be fresh.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma a wɔde yɛ aduan no nyinaa yɛ foforo.
But it does the job.	Nanso ɛyɛ adwuma no.
This time will come soon.	Saa bere yi bɛba nnansa yi ara.
That’s why the song touched me so much.	Ɛno nti na dwom no kaa me kɛse no.
But we are all imperfect.	Nanso yɛn nyinaa nyɛ pɛ.
However, it is somewhat surprising that it is not.	Nanso, ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
I make music for the people.	Meyɛ nnwom ma nkurɔfo no.
But he only wanted one.	Nanso na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biako pɛ.
This is often the case.	Eyi taa ba.
As if this was my fault.	Te sɛ nea eyi yɛ me mfomso.
I don’t like being normal.	M’ani nnye ho sɛ mɛyɛ obi a ɔte ase.
He knows he will be late.	Onim sɛ ɔbɛka akyi.
That’s the point of the whole thing.	Ɛno ne asɛm a ɛwɔ asɛm no nyinaa mu.
One can only hope the same.	Obi betumi anya anidaso sɛ ɛte saa ara.
It’s not just us.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn kɛkɛ.
Drive the car carefully!	Ka kar no yiye!
There is nothing.	Biribi nni hɔ.
Do what works.	Yɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma.
Except that as.	Gye sɛ sɛnea.
Are you working? 	So woreyɛ adwuma?
But this is from me.	Nanso eyi fi me hɔ.
. . . .	.
He didn’t want to lie to them.	Na ɔmpɛ sɛ odi atoro kyerɛ wɔn.
I saw him and it was obvious something was wrong.	Mihuu no na na ɛda adi sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye.
Keep an eye on them.	Hwɛ wɔn so.
His money was used for a lot of food.	Wɔde ne sika no yɛɛ aduan pii.
There are a few reasons for this.	Nneɛma kakraa bi nti na ɛte saa.
Remove and set aside.	Yi na fa to nkyɛn.
He was shocked.	Ne ho dwiriw no.
At least three should be two.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ abiɛsa yɛ abien.
He was indeed alive.	Na ɔte ase ampa.
I was alone the whole time.	Ná me nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ saa bere no nyinaa.
She liked being admired.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho.
She is your wife.	Ɔyɛ wo yere.
He patted the dog on the head.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ɔkraman no ti.
However, no one comes out.	Nanso, obiara mfi adi.
The situation is tense.	Tebea no mu yɛ den.
This has to be this time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ saa bere yi de.
But the perspective is in order.	Nanso adwene a wɔde hwɛ ade no wɔ nhyehyɛe mu.
I thought you’d like it.	Misusuwii sɛ w’ani begye ho.
This can be good or bad.	Eyi betumi ayɛ papa anaa bɔne.
He was a boy again.	Ná ɔyɛ abarimaa bio.
That’s my real problem.	Ɛno ne me haw ankasa.
I want that so much for him.	Mepɛ saa paa ma no.
He kicked his legs.	Ɔde ne nan bɔɔ ne nan so.
I know you well enough.	Minim wo yiye.
But it certainly doesn’t matter.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛho nhia.
I’m in love with them.	M’ani gye wɔn ho.
We used data from older people.	Yɛde nnipa a wɔn mfe akɔ anim ho nsɛm dii dwuma.
I don’t really have to be pretty.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ me ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
All the way in the background.	Ɔkwan no nyinaa wɔ akyi.
For a moment, anyway.	Bere tiaa bi, sɛnea ɛte biara.
But he wasn’t.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ saa.
It’s also great.	Ɛyɛ kɛse nso.
He’s on it again.	Ɔwɔ so bio.
So maybe this is your problem.	Enti ebia eyi ne wo haw.
Look at that guy.	Hwɛ saa ɔbarima no.
The picture below kind of shows how hot it is.	Mfonini a ɛwɔ ase hɔ no ɔkwan bi so kyerɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ hyew no.
It’s interesting that it’s another day too.	Ɛyɛ anigye sɛ ɛyɛ da foforo nso.
I seemed to be getting older.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea me mfe akɔ anim.
However, it doesn’t matter.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ hwee.
Mom kept working.	Maame kɔɔ so yɛɛ adwuma.
Its backdrop was beautiful.	Ná ne mfonini a ɛwɔ akyi no yɛ fɛ.
At least it doesn’t really matter.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia ankasa.
I need to get in there.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ mu wɔ hɔ.
Maybe there’s something to that idea.	Ebia biribi wɔ saa adwene no mu.
Except take it for granted .	Gye sɛ fa no sɛnea ɛte no .
That’s his age.	Ɛno ne ne mfe.
That’s as good as it gets.	Ɛno yɛ papa sɛnea ɛyɛ.
The quality is first class.	Su no yɛ nea edi kan.
On my first go.	Wɔ me kɔ a edi kan no mu.
There are other factors as well.	Nneɛma foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
There are many things.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ.
He does more than that.	Ɔyɛ pii sen saa.
He wasn’t tall either.	Ná ɔnyɛ tenten nso.
But don't put your head down yet.	Nanso mfa wo ti nkɔ fam de besi nnɛ.
Your father is involved in a very important matter now.	Wo papa de ne ho ahyɛ asɛm bi a ɛho hia yiye mu mprempren.
This is one of those cases.	Eyi yɛ saa nsɛm no mu biako.
If they like it, great.	Sɛ wɔn ani gye ho a, ɛyɛ kɛse.
The table is full of food.	Aduan ahyɛ pon no so ma.
Being like something every day can’t be easy.	Sɛ́ wobɛyɛ wo ho sɛ biribi da biara da no ntumi nyɛ mmerɛw.
This wasn’t going to work.	Ná eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
The results have been amazing.	Nea afi mu aba no ayɛ nwonwa.
I don’t do that.	Menyɛ saa.
This is not an idea.	Eyi nyɛ adwene bi.
The bus was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ bɔs no mu ma.
I didn’t think anyone would.	Na minsusuw sɛ obiara bɛyɛ saa.
As it is in me.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ me mu no.
I prefer the first one.	Mepɛ nea edi kan no.
They are certainly dangerous as well.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔyɛ asiane nso.
He wants to tell the truth.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka nokware.
Or sleep next to me.	Anaasɛ nna wɔ me nkyɛn.
There is no mistake now.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ mprempren.
It’s one of my favorite things.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma a m’ani gye ho paa no mu biako.
I have the power.	Mewɔ tumi.
But it has been great.	Nanso ayɛ kɛse.
It was part of the story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm no fã.
That’s still there.	Ɛno da so ara wɔ hɔ.
This is not your business.	Eyi nyɛ wo asɛm.
Feel what it feels like to be.	Te sɛnea ɛte sɛ nea woyɛ no nka.
It was actually pretty good.	Ná eye yiye ankasa.
Plan to stay for two hours.	Yɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ wobɛka nnɔnhwerew abien.
Now you have two things.	Seesei wowɔ nneɛma abien.
And a little bit for me too.	Na kakra ma me nso.
It’s too good to be true.	Ɛyɛ papa dodo sɛ wobɛyɛ.
I wish there was more of that.	Me yam a anka ɛno pii wɔ hɔ.
Not a little bit.	Ɛnyɛ kakra bi.
The accident was entirely his fault.	Ná akwanhyia no yɛ ne mfomso koraa.
And that’s something.	Na ɛno yɛ biribi.
You got to wait.	Wo nyaa kwan hwɛ kwan.
The image quality is excellent.	Mfonini no su yɛ fɛ yiye.
Start again somewhere else.	Fi ase bio wɔ baabi foforo.
He had friends there.	Ná ɔwɔ nnamfo wɔ hɔ.
So his words mean nothing.	Enti ne nsɛm no nkyerɛ hwee.
They have been doing so for years.	Wɔde mfe pii ayɛ saa.
Back to work.	San kɔ adwuma mu.
He was very large.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse paa.
That’s what kids do.	Saa na mmofra yɛ.
Which would have been bad.	Nea anka ɛbɛyɛ bɔne.
I just can’t do it.	Mintumi nyɛ kɛkɛ.
Think and see.	Susuw na hwɛ.
This test lasts about three hours.	Saa sɔhwɛ yi di bɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa.
That doesn’t matter to me.	Ɛno nyɛ hwee wɔ me fam.
This situation is not sustainable.	Saa tebea yi ntumi nkɔ so.
I hope they enjoy it there.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wɔn ani begye ho wɔ hɔ.
They have to make their own.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔn ankasa de.
The boy is afraid of danger.	Abarimaa no suro asiane.
You are so wonderful.	Woyɛ nwonwa paa.
Most of them are still conference rooms.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara da so ara yɛ nhyiam dan.
The idea is a little scary.	Adwene no yɛ hu kakra.
Everything else should stay put.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribiara a aka no tra baabi a ɛwɔ.
I want to hear from you.	Mepɛ sɛ mete mo nsɛm.
He did it last night.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​anadwo a etwaam no.
I don’t know what’s in it.	Minnim nea ɛwɔ mu.
I have no idea how he does it.	Minnim sɛnea ɔyɛ no ho adwene biara.
I wonder if it’s true.	Misusuw sɛ ebia ɛyɛ nokware anaa.
I wanted to say it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka.
Go to work now.	Kɔ adwuma mprempren.
There was a letter.	Ná krataa bi wɔ hɔ.
But it would be dangerous, too.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ asiane, nso.
Make the time.	Yɛ bere no.
The picture is simple.	Mfonini no yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
This is beyond my control.	Eyi yɛ nea mintumi nyɛ ho hwee.
Not us, not them.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn, ɛnyɛ wɔn.
The dog can run very fast.	Ɔkraman no tumi tu mmirika kɛse.
So the user is stuck.	Enti nea ɔde di dwuma no akɔ so ayɛ adwuma.
This is very important.	Eyi ho hia yiye.
I can be completely honest with you.	Metumi adi wo nokware koraa.
Very dangerous but beautiful about it.	Asiane kɛse nanso ne ho yɛ fɛ wɔ ho.
There was no other man like him.	Ná ɔbarima foforo biara nni hɔ a ɔte saa.
Maybe you have a story.	Ebia wowɔ asɛm bi.
Now is as good a time as any.	Mprempren yɛ bere pa te sɛ bere biara.
The controls were powerful.	Ná nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma no yɛ nea tumi wom.
It is an obvious lie.	Ɛyɛ atoro a ɛda adi sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
Thank you for everything you have done for me.	Meda wo ase wɔ biribiara a woayɛ ama me no ho.
He always has it.	Ɔwɔ bi bere nyinaa.
This whole city is.	Kurow yi nyinaa yɛ.
This is getting exciting.	Eyi reyɛ anigye.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho.
There was plenty of room.	Ná baabi pii wɔ hɔ.
He ran toward her.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ ne nkyɛn.
It’s still just as beautiful.	Ɛda so ara yɛ fɛ saa ara.
After all, they were pretty amazing.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na wɔyɛ nwonwa yiye.
No one said much.	Obiara anka pii.
I'm sick of it here.	Me ho ayɛ me yaw wɔ ha.
He spent the whole afternoon working on the paper.	Ɔde awia mũ nyinaa yɛɛ krataa no ho adwuma.
However, the results have not been very good.	Nanso, nea afi mu aba no nyɛɛ yiye kɛse.
As the film.	Sɛ́ sini no.
He could have played almost anything.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ anka obetumi abɔ biribiara.
The more you do it, the easier it gets.	Dodow a woyɛ no, dodow no ara na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
But not very often.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii.
Their work was a success.	Wɔn adwuma no dii yiye.
It’s not really realistic.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware ankasa.
You know for a variety of reasons.	Nneɛma ahorow nti na wunim.
I have a temporary job.	Mewɔ bere tiaa mu adwuma bi.
She was very beautiful, but very unhappy.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye, nanso na n’ani nnye koraa.
Now it’s every day.	Seesei ɛyɛ da biara da.
I didn’t have that kind of time.	Ná minni bere a ɛte saa.
I still couldn’t find him.	Ná meda so ara ntumi nhu no.
I could find where he was.	Ná metumi anya baabi a ɔwɔ.
Just tell me what you think.	Ka nea wususuw ho kyerɛ me kɛkɛ.
I'm just lucky to be here.	Mewɔ anigye ara kwa sɛ mewɔ ha.
It’s nice to have you here with me!.	Ɛyɛ anigye sɛ wo ne me wɔ ha!.
He is strong and independent.	Ɔyɛ den na ɔde ne ho.
That was never the point.	Ná ɛno nyɛ asɛm no da.
This is not a new conclusion.	Eyi nyɛ asɛm foforo a wɔde baa awiei.
One truth, mostly, to be told.	Nokware biako, dodow no ara, a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka.
Children have a big problem right now.	Mmofra wɔ ɔhaw kɛse mprempren.
Everyone knew it, even the kids.	Ná obiara nim, mmofra mpo.
But things couldn’t go that way.	Nanso nneɛma no antumi ankɔ saa kwan no so.
We were enjoying it.	Ná yɛn ani gye ho.
People come to the door.	Nkurɔfo ba ɔpon no ano.
he says that.	ɔka sɛ.
The first one was easy.	Ná nea edi kan no yɛ mmerɛw.
He does something else.	Ɔyɛ biribi foforo.
That, is your current situation.	Ɛno, ne wo mprempren tebea.
It’s their job.	Ɛyɛ wɔn adwuma.
But that is not the problem in the case before us.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne ɔhaw a ɛwɔ asɛm a ɛwɔ yɛn anim no mu.
I felt numb.	Metee nka sɛ me ho ayɛ me hyew.
There are some things that need to be done.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
They were being taken somewhere.	Ná wɔde wɔn rekɔ baabi.
But not in a good way.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɔkwan pa so.
You are doing a great job!.	Woreyɛ adwuma kɛse!.
This is not surprising.	Eyi nyɛ nwonwa.
Probably my favorite book of all time.	Ebia nhoma a m’ani gye ho sen biara wɔ bere nyinaa mu.
Or better yet, for that matter.	Anaasɛ eye sen saa, ɛno nti.
But only one.	Nanso biako pɛ.
More stuff, more power.	Nneɛma pii, tumi kɛse.
This saved my life a lot.	Eyi gyee me nkwa kɛse.
Quick and easy!.	Ntɛmntɛm na ɛnyɛ den!.
I still can’t believe it.	Meda so ara ntumi nnye nni.
The road did continue.	Ɔkwan no kɔɔ so ampa.
We have a dog.	Yɛwɔ ɔkraman.
He had no idea about it.	Ná onni ho adwene biara.
How much life there is in it.	Hwɛ sɛnea nkwa pii wɔ mu.
The offer is limited to limited users.	Nea wɔde ma no yɛ ma wɔn a wɔde di dwuma kakraa bi pɛ.
They were added.	Wɔde kaa ho.
It’s me he wants.	Ɛyɛ me na ɔpɛ.
I know why that is.	Minim nea enti a ɛte saa.
So this is more of the same.	Enti eyi yɛ ade koro no ara kɛse.
The house was warm, but otherwise not spectacular at all.	Ná ofie no mu yɛ hyew, nanso sɛ ɛnte saa a, na ɛnyɛ nwonwa koraa.
So, it was a lot of fun.	Enti, na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
Even so, this felt important.	Ɛno mpo no, eyi tee nka sɛ ɛho hia.
We are here to stay.	Yɛwɔ ha.
It has to do this or else it doesn’t matter.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ eyi anyɛ saa a ɛnyɛ hwee.
A few years ago to the present.	Mfe kakraa bi a atwam ni no de besi nnɛ.
The view is beautiful too.	Adwene no nso yɛ fɛ.
They seemed to do a lot of that.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ saa nneɛma pii.
There is plenty of time!.	Bere pii wɔ hɔ!.
It’s just as scary as ever.	Ɛyɛ hu te sɛ kan no ara pɛ.
It’s really amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
It was a very interesting meeting.	Ná ɛyɛ nhyiam a ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
The music is amazing and fun.	Nnwom no yɛ nwonwa na ɛyɛ anigye.
He didn’t like her anymore.	Ná n’ani nnye ne ho bio.
Apparently he is.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔte saa.
Give me a moment, please.	Mesrɛ wo, ma me bere tiaa bi.
Take this approach.	Fa saa kwan yi so.
Anyone could have said those things back then.	Anka obiara betumi aka saa nsɛm no saa bere no.
But this is also my next plan.	Nanso eyi nso ne me nhyehyɛe a edi hɔ.
Many have said that his plans are not unwise.	Nnipa pii aka sɛ ne nhyehyɛe ahorow no nyɛ nea nyansa nnim.
Nothing was the same as before.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na ɛte sɛ nea na ɛte kan no.
Maybe something big is at work.	Ebia biribi kɛse bi wɔ adwumam.
But it doesn’t have to be.	Nanso enhia sɛ ɛte saa.
This is just play money.	Eyi yɛ agoru sika ara kwa.
Who is there to be? 	Hena na ɔwɔ hɔ?
You hope you never have to use it.	Wowɔ anidaso sɛ ɛho nhia sɛ wode di dwuma da.
And maybe no one ever told him.	Na ebia obiara anka ankyerɛ no da.
We can’t do it here.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ wɔ ha.
The situation was unclear.	Ná tebea no mu nna hɔ.
I know you are a good person.	Minim sɛ woyɛ onipa pa.
I can’t quite believe it.	Me ntumi nnye nni koraa.
My room!	Me dan!
It was good, and much better.	Na eye, na eye pii.
You are so beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
He was not in good shape.	Ná onni tebea pa mu.
He has power, though.	Ɔwɔ tumi, nanso.
He was too charming.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ dodo.
But that’s simply not true.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ nokware kɛkɛ.
So, our story follows.	Enti, yɛn asɛm no di akyi.
He puts his name on her.	Ɔde ne din to no so.
And in the hope.	Na wɔ anidaso mu.
He will go with you.	Ɔne wo bɛkɔ.
It’s that simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
It might be better to use him in the same way.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ wode no bedi dwuma saa ara.
But only for a short time.	Nanso bere tiaa bi pɛ.
The work was getting bigger.	Ná adwuma no reyɛ kɛse.
He was such a nice guy.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ saa.
The priorities were strong.	Ná nneɛma a ɛho hia no mu yɛ den.
This is really obvious, indeed!	Eyi da adi ankasa, ampa!
No child would say that.	Abofra biara nni hɔ a ɔbɛka saa.
But we could.	Nanso na yebetumi.
I loved those things.	Ná m’ani gye saa nneɛma no ho.
Give them food.	Ma wɔn aduan.
You know, that girl is really pretty.	Wunim, saa abeawa no ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
Probably not a big deal.	Ebia ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse.
I have to lie down.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda fam.
He did two other things well.	Ɔyɛɛ nneɛma foforo abien yiye.
And guess what else? 	Na susuw ho sɛ dɛn bio?
But only in name.	Nanso din mu nkutoo.
No one outside knew about it.	Ná obiara nni abɔnten a onim ho hwee.
And it really works.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma ampa.
It was incredibly hard and he wasn’t even my baby.	Na ɛyɛ den a ɛyɛ nwonwa na na ɔnyɛ me ba mpo.
Apparently, two things happened.	Ɛda adi sɛ nneɛma abien na esii.
He wasn't too pretty.	Ná ne ho nyɛ fɛ dodo.
There were two children.	Ná mmofra baanu wɔ hɔ.
Except you don’t have to act.	Gye sɛ enhia sɛ woyɛ agoru.
But it was something else.	Nanso na ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
You can start now.	Wubetumi afi ase mprempren.
There was another problem.	Ná ɔhaw foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
However, this is only one side of the problem.	Nanso, eyi yɛ ɔhaw no fã biako pɛ.
He glanced at the other man.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ɔbarima foforo no.
It works just like the one you used before.	Ɛyɛ adwuma te sɛ nea wode dii dwuma kan no ara pɛ.
Things looked even better.	Ná nneɛma hwɛ yiye mpo.
The dog looks like a dog.	Ɔkraman no te sɛ ɔkraman.
We have everything and everything.	Yɛwɔ biribiara ne biribiara.
That’s if you’re interested at all.	Ɛno ne sɛ w’ani gye ho koraa a.
This is actually pretty simple.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye ankasa.
You know where he is.	Wunim baabi a ɔwɔ.
Not that picture.	Ɛnyɛ saa mfonini no.
I didn’t want to sleep.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meda.
They were set aside.	Wɔde wɔn too nkyɛn.
His mother said he was a nice person.	Ne maame kae sɛ ɔyɛ onipa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
This was not the case two years ago.	Ná eyi nte saa mfe abien a atwam ni.
It is so cold, though.	Nanso, awɔw wom saa.
Just remove it.	Yi fi hɔ kɛkɛ.
After those days.	Saa nna no akyi.
The story shocked me.	Asɛm no maa me ho dwiriw me.
This information can only be mental.	Saa nsɛm yi betumi ayɛ adwene mu nsɛm nkutoo.
Nor should we overreact to the latest figures.	Saa ara nso na ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ade tra so wɔ dodow a aba foforo no ho.
They put him in the car.	Wɔde no traa kar no mu.
This is something we really need to work on.	Eyi yɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho adwuma ankasa.
I told you that afternoon.	Meka kyerɛɛ wo saa awia no.
Whatever you are doing, keep doing it.	Biribiara a woreyɛ no, kɔ so yɛ.
He didn't know what they were.	Ná onnim nea wɔyɛ.
I was neither surprised nor surprised.	Ná ɛyɛ me nwonwa na na ɛnyɛ me nwonwa nso.
I was happy in my room.	Ná m’ani agye wɔ me dan mu.
It had happened.	Ná asi.
You're almost right.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ woayɛ no yiye.
That’s what happened.	Ɛno ne nea esii.
More of the same stuff.	Nneɛma koro no ara ho pii.
And he will do so.	Na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
A version of the game was used in the movie.	Wɔde agoru no fã bi dii dwuma wɔ sini no mu.
Besides, there are only two of them.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, wɔn mu abien pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
She could forget everything, absorb herself in him.	Ná ne werɛ betumi afi biribiara, na ɔde ne ho ahyɛ ne mu.
We have help.	Yɛwɔ mmoa.
And forget everything you know.	Na wo werɛ mfi biribiara a wunim.
Money was tight.	Ná sika ayɛ den.
We’re interested in it.	Yɛn ani gye ho.
You know, important stuff like that.	Wunim, nneɛma a ɛho hia te sɛ ɛno.
For that, and for the person.	Ɛno nti, ne onipa no nti.
Which is a sin.	Nea ɛyɛ bɔne.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ.
Both my good and evil.	Me papa ne bɔne nyinaa.
I disagree with him here.	Me ne no nyɛ adwene wɔ ha.
It’s just like them.	Ɛte sɛ wɔn ara pɛ.
It’s a lot of things.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma pii.
Therefore, this method is widely used now.	Enti, wɔde saa kwan yi di dwuma kɛse mprempren.
I don’t even like that one, though.	Nanso, m’ani nnye saa biako no ho mpo.
He took some home.	Ɔde bi kɔɔ fie.
What to do about them.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔ wɔn ho.
You may even have used it.	Ebia wode adi dwuma mpo.
But he doesn’t.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa.
Get out of there and go to him.	Fi hɔ kɔ ne nkyɛn.
I thought you knew.	Misusuwii sɛ wunim.
Everything you said is very true.	Biribiara a wokae no yɛ nokware paa.
Why is it so hot?	Dɛn nti na ɛyɛ hyew saa?
People always remember the first one.	Nkurɔfo kae nea edi kan no bere nyinaa.
We cannot control him ourselves.	Yɛn ankasa ntumi nni ne so.
People accept it.	Nkurɔfo gye tom.
You don’t have to be here.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wowɔ ha.
I don’t have to and shouldn’t.	Ɛho nhia sɛ meyɛ saa na ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
I knew that.	Ná minim saa.
They seem to be free.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔde wɔn ho.
This is a little more complicated.	Eyi yɛ nea ɛyɛ den kakra.
He is always late.	Ɔka akyi bere nyinaa.
There were several reasons for this.	Ná nneɛma pii nti na ɛte saa.
I think he needs to do that a little bit.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa kakra.
It seems too simple.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
Get over it and go back in time.	Di so na san kɔ bere no mu.
It seemed like no big deal to me.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse biara mma me.
Under the floor.	Wɔ fam no ase.
The final conclusion.	Awiei a etwa to no.
No one seemed to notice.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara anhu.
Nothing seemed to matter.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara ho nhia.
Everything is going wrong.	Biribiara rekɔ bɔne.
I can decide how to spend my time.	Metumi asi sɛnea mede me bere bedi dwuma ho gyinae.
He hoped he was, but he knew he wasn't.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɔte saa, nanso na onim sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
Just run away.	Tu mmirika kɔ kɛkɛ.
It needs to be discussed.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka ho asɛm.
I look to him every day for it.	Mehwɛ ne nkyɛn da biara da wɔ ho.
However, something like that.	Nanso, biribi a ɛte saa.
I can’t do anything.	Me ntumi nyɛ hwee.
You just want to be yourself.	Wopɛ sɛ woyɛ wo ho ara kwa.
You have a problem.	Wowɔ ɔhaw bi.
Just one week.	Dapɛn biako pɛ.
But that doesn’t make it bad.	Nanso ɛno mma ɛnyɛ bɔne.
It will be difficult in every way.	Ɛbɛyɛ den wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
We were impressed with them.	Yɛn ani gyee wɔn ho.
Rely.	Fa wo ho to so.
But that is a real danger.	Nanso ɛno yɛ asiane ankasa.
His wife had been in a car accident.	Ná ne yere anya kar akwanhyia.
Someone has to speak up.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi kasa.
I knew him inside.	Ná minim no wɔ mu.
It wasn’t great, but it wasn’t bad.	Na ɛnyɛ kɛse, nanso na ɛnyɛ bɔne.
In bed he was brilliant.	Wɔ mpa so no na ne ho akokwaw.
He has friends.	Ɔwɔ nnamfo.
I do have something to tell you.	Mewɔ asɛm bi a mɛka akyerɛ wo ampa.
There is much to be surprised about.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn ho dwiriw yɛn.
It exists but it doesn’t.	Ɛwɔ hɔ nanso ɛnte saa.
Everyone knew the song.	Ná obiara nim dwom no.
There are now much better options.	Mprempren nneɛma a eye sen saa pii wɔ hɔ.
Is that what you really mean?	So saa na wopɛ sɛ woka ankasa?
I know you have at least two.	Minim sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, wowɔ abien.
My mother was not very good.	Ná me maame nyɛ papa koraa.
There was no problem.	Ná ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
He had put it in anyway.	Ná ɔde ahyɛ mu ɔkwan biara so.
He would do another time.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ bere foforo.
I wanted to be a mom one day.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ maame da bi.
Consider the book.	Susuw nhoma no ho hwɛ.
The task was relatively easy.	Ná adwuma no yɛ mmerɛw kakra.
That’s what we’re going to do.	Ɛno ne nea yɛbɛyɛ.
Part of me.	Me fã bi.
This is something you should never do.	Eyi yɛ biribi a ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ da.
He knew that, but it was a thought, really.	Ná onim saa, nanso na ɛyɛ adwene, ampa.
The room was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ dan no mu ma.
About yourself.	Wo ho nsɛm.
But it doesn’t work.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma.
This touched the house.	Eyi kaa fie.
Which was for our girl this past year.	Nea na ɛyɛ ma yɛn abeawa no afe a etwaam yi.
That’s your problem, not mine.	Ɛno ne wo haw, ɛnyɛ me de.
You don’t want me there, under your bed.	Wompɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ, wɔ wo mpa ase.
This table should not contain this large number of people.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ nnipa dodow dodow yi wɔ pon yi so.
I feel the way it is.	Mete sɛnea ɛte no nka.
However, it is not the end of the story.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ asɛm no awiei.
The face is very clear.	Anim no mu da hɔ yiye.
About my subordinate's age.	Me ase mfe a obi adi ho asɛm.
But he wanted to talk about it.	Nanso na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka ho asɛm.
I don’t have many hobbies.	Minni nneɛma pii a mede gye m’ani.
I want to be in the here and now.	Mepɛ sɛ mewɔ ha ne mprempren no mu.
No one can do you better.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ wo yiye sen wo.
He drove a race car.	Ná ɔka kar a wɔde tu mmirika.
What a powerful thing to say.	Hwɛ ade a tumi wom a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka kyerɛ.
I am a graphic designer.	Meyɛ obi a ɔyɛ mfonini.
But there is no one.	Nanso obiara nni hɔ.
It’s a boy.	Ɛyɛ abarimaa.
The housework is too hard for me.	Ofie nnwuma no yɛ den dodo ma me.
I still can.	Meda so ara tumi.
Boy, he does when he can.	Abarimaa, ɔyɛ saa bere a obetumi.
I have used it daily and love it more than that.	Mede adi dwuma da biara da na m’ani gye ho sen saa.
Back to work.	San kɔ adwuma mu.
Generally things remained the same.	Mpɛn pii no nneɛma kɔɔ so yɛɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
That’s a long way off.	Ɛno yɛ ɔkwan tenten.
A little goes a long way.	Kakraa bi kɔ akyiri.
Might as well add it.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ mede bɛka ho.
Later, he forgot where he parked the car.	Akyiri yi, ne werɛ fii baabi a ɔde kar no sii.
You can’t do that.	Worentumi nyɛ saa.
It was way ahead of what everyone else was doing.	Ná edi nea na obiara reyɛ no anim koraa.
I say why not.	Meka sɛ dɛn nti na ɛnte saa.
I nodded reluctantly.	Mede me ti too hɔ a na mempɛ.
Thank you.	Meda wo ase.
We had the same interests.	Ná yɛn ani gye nneɛma koro no ara ho.
There was nothing in his eyes.	Ná biribiara nni n’ani so.
However, there are several problems with this idea.	Nanso, ɔhaw ahorow pii wɔ saa adwene yi ho.
But that wasn’t the point of this weekend.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm a ɛwɔ dapɛn awiei yi mu.
I don’t know all the details.	Minnim nsɛm no mu nsɛm nyinaa.
You can do the same thing here.	Wubetumi ayɛ ade koro no ara wɔ ha.
That is what he wants us to do.	Ɛno ne nea ɔpɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
But he’s a great guy.	Nanso ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse.
But this is a big deal.	Nanso eyi yɛ asɛm kɛse.
You need to update this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi foforo.
These pictures are more realistic.	Saa mfonini ahorow yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware kɛse.
This will take hours.	Eyi begye nnɔnhwerew pii.
It becomes a product.	Ɛbɛyɛ ade a wɔde yɛ ade.
Wrong.	Ti.
I want our children to live.	Mepɛ sɛ yɛn mma no tra ase.
That, and that, and that too.	Ɛno, ne ɛno, ne ɛno nso.
Or he could do something.	Anaasɛ na obetumi ayɛ biribi.
I can’t tell anyone.	Mintumi nka nkyerɛ obiara.
What wonderful pictures.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni.
But most don’t.	Nanso dodow no ara nyɛ saa.
But if he did	Nanso sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa a .
This is a new song.	Eyi yɛ dwom foforo.
He gave her his hand.	Ɔde ne nsa maa no.
There is nothing else in that.	Biribiara foforo biara nni saa asɛm no mu.
Many in the summer.	Pii wɔ awɔw bere mu.
There is no need for a supply chain.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ nneɛma a wɔde ma ho nhyehyɛe.
I go to his room.	Mekɔ ne dan mu.
Winters used to be very harsh.	Kan no na awɔw bere mu yɛ den yiye.
Many of the cars look expensive.	Kar ahorow no pii hwɛ sɛ ne bo yɛ den.
Whatever your product is.	Nea wo ade no yɛ biara.
I really like this idea.	M’ani gye saa adwene yi ho ankasa.
But he would do that.	Nanso na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I just don't really know how to use it properly.	Minnim sɛnea mede bedi dwuma yiye ankasa kɛkɛ.
Which is old news, true.	Nea ɛyɛ asɛm dedaw no, ɛyɛ nokware.
I think it’s a very positive story.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ papa yiye.
It wasn’t a surprise.	Ná ɛnyɛ nwonwa.
That person thinks that everyone is like him.	Saa onipa no susuw sɛ nnipa nyinaa te sɛ ɔno.
These days, truth is no longer important.	Nna yi, nokware ho nhia bio.
In everything they were.	Wɔ biribiara mu a na wɔyɛ.
And my new book.	Na me nhoma foforo no nso.
He had to work for her.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma ma no.
The child, and his mother, had been very happy.	Ná abofra no, ne ne maame anya anigye kɛse.
There is obviously a very important mutual interest there.	Ɛda adi sɛ anigye a ɛho hia kɛse wɔ hɔ a wɔn ho wɔn ho wɔ wɔ hɔ.
You don’t do that.	Wonyɛ saa.
The bus left on time.	Bɔs no fii hɔ wɔ bere ano.
If you like it, sit down.	Sɛ w’ani gye ho a, tra ase.
The less the merrier!	Dodow a ɛnyɛ pii no, dodow no ara na ɛyɛ anigye!
And he did know that.	Na na onim saa ampa.
They talk about it.	Wɔka ho asɛm.
But he wasn’t happy with her.	Nanso na n’ani nnye ne ho.
He did just fine.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​yiye ara kwa.
Isn’t he doing a good job?	So ɔnyɛ adwuma pa?
Not if we can help it.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ yebetumi aboa a.
We just can’t take him for granted here.	Yɛrentumi mfa no nyɛ hwee wɔ ha kɛkɛ.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ebia ɛte saa ara.
It might as well not be so bad.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ yiye sɛ ɛnyɛ bɔne saa.
But it is not the last of his problems.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ne haw ahorow no mu nea etwa to.
Too hot to work today.	Ɛyɛ hyew dodo sɛ wobɛyɛ adwuma nnɛ.
Thank you again.	Meda mo ase bio.
But there is a bigger picture in this project.	Nanso mfonini kɛse bi wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
He told himself he would do it later.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ no akyiri yi.
I agree with you here.	Me ne wo yɛ adwene wɔ ha.
I spent a lot of time outside.	Mede bere pii traa abɔnten.
We are just too good for this.	Yɛyɛ papa dodo ma eyi ara kwa.
He is full of life.	Nkwa ahyɛ no ma.
Either way, few can forget.	Ɔkwan biara so no, nnipa kakraa bi na wɔn werɛ betumi afi.
But how he can paint.	Nanso sɛnea obetumi ayɛ mfonini.
His eyes fell on mine.	N’ani baa me de so.
Is that all about?.	Ɛno nyinaa fa ho?.
And there were plenty of them.	Na ɛdɔɔso nso.
You are not big enough.	Wonyɛ kɛse sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He never had one, though.	Na onni bi da, nanso.
Otherwise he risks everything.	Anyɛ saa a ɔde biribiara to asiane mu.
The details come later.	Nsɛm no ba akyiri yi.
And he didn’t know what to do.	Na na onnim nea ɔnyɛ.
In my father and mother.	Wɔ me papa ne me maame mu.

She's really nice.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
Two years, maybe three.	Mfe abien, ebia abiɛsa.
There is nothing to be done.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
My intention was to keep going if nothing else.	Ná m’adwene ne sɛ mɛkɔ so akɔ so sɛ biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a.
I need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
You and your wife were happy.	Wo ne wo yere yɛɛ anigye.
I had a pretty good idea of ​​what this meant.	Ná mewɔ adwene a eye yiye wɔ nea eyi kyerɛ ho.
This is becoming more common in recent years.	Eyi rekɔ so kɛse wɔ nnansa yi mfe mu.
At least every day should start that way.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ da biara fi ase saa.
Your license has expired.	Wo tumi krataa no atwam.
Not even a ride.	Ɛnyɛ kar a wɔde tra mu mpo.
He ate it with pleasure.	Ɔde anigye dii.
Animals could reach them quickly.	Ná mmoa betumi adu wɔn nkyɛn ntɛm.
His father would be very happy.	Ná ne papa ani begye kɛse.
He had to touch that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka saa asɛm no.
There was nothing else to do.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
The same goes for the books.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nhoma ahorow no ho.
Not until much later that is.	Ɛnyɛ akyiri yi koraa ansa na ɛno ne.
You have a good job.	Wowɔ adwuma pa.
There is no other plan.	Nhyehyɛe foforo biara nni hɔ.
Go back to the scene.	San kɔ hɔ.
There is no doubt that one can do such a thing.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ obi betumi ayɛ ade a ɛte saa.
I couldn’t see the rest.	Na mintumi nhu nea aka no.
The price is limited to the product and price.	Bo no yɛ nea wɔde yɛ ade no ne ne bo nkutoo.
That has happened, too.	Ɛno nso asi.
He gets along very well with his father.	Ɔne ne papa di yiye paa.
Next week it’s your turn.	Dapɛn a edi hɔ no ɛyɛ wo de.
I had them.	Ná mewɔ wɔn.
He wasn’t interested.	Ná n’ani nnye ho.
The book is filled with beautiful illustrations.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ ahyɛ nhoma no ma.
That’s how my mind would work.	Saa na na m’adwene bɛyɛ adwuma.
That’s a good thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade pa.
Something is happening with this thing.	Biribi rekɔ so wɔ saa ade yi ho.
You are as young as you ever were.	Woyɛ abofra te sɛ nea na woyɛ pɛn no.
That was days ago.	Ɛno yɛ nna bi a atwam ni.
This dress is new.	Saa atade yi yɛ foforo.
We’re happy to do that.	Yɛn ani gye ho sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa.
You have it in you.	Wowɔ bi wɔ wo mu.
Thank you for right now.	Meda mo ase sɛ mprempren ara.
I feel like it’s hurting me.	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ me yaw.
Here is his worksheet.	Ne adwuma krataa ni.
This is not possible.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
So just have fun.	Enti gye w’ani kɛkɛ.
Several days had passed.	Ná nna pii atwam.
The whole house was gone.	Ná ofie no nyinaa nni hɔ bio.
We are just the suppliers.	Yɛyɛ nneɛma a wɔde ma no ara kwa.
It was really exciting for him.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye ankasa ma no.
That may seem like a lot of time.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ bere pii.
That’s why it’s the way it is.	Ɛno nti na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte no.
Not that first time.	Ɛnyɛ saa bere a edi kan no.
However, you don’t.	Nanso, wonyɛ saa.
At this point, it really, really matters.	Saa bere yi de, ɛho hia ankasa, ankasa.
Not a normal man.	Ɛnyɛ ɔbarima a ɔte ase.
He was feeling happy.	Ná ɔte nka sɛ n’ani agye.
My mom made dinner.	Me maame yɛɛ anwummere aduan.
Go home now and you will be fine.	Kɔ fie mprempren na wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
Same thing with that.	Ade koro no ara wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
The music was the same.	Ná nnwom no yɛ ade koro.
You definitely have a point there.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wowɔ asɛm bi wɔ hɔ.
We can talk about it another time.	Yebetumi aka ho asɛm bere foforo.
The first meeting really had nothing to do with me.	Ná nhyiam a edi kan no ne me nni hwee yɛ ankasa.
Next to each picture.	Wɔ mfonini biara nkyɛn.
Even this doesn’t seem too bad.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi mpo nyɛ bɔne dodo.
I didn’t care about anything.	Ná biribiara mfa me ho.
He knows it well there.	Onim no yiye wɔ hɔ.
You know what he looks like.	Wunim sɛnea ɔte.
You know you can.	Wunim sɛ wubetumi.
There can be no doubt about that.	Obiara ntumi nnya akyinnye biara wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I want to do it for myself.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ma me ho.
Or most of them.	Anaasɛ wɔn mu dodow no ara.
Food is too expensive!	Aduan bo yɛ den dodo!
Spend time on it.	Fa bere di dwuma wɔ ho.
I knew what it would be.	Ná minim nea ɛbɛyɛ.
This has been going on too long.	Eyi akɔ so akyɛ dodo.
They both knew that.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa nim saa.
I will set them up here.	Mede wɔn besi hɔ wɔ ha.
No one is doing it.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔreyɛ.
It’s pretty simple for the reason.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye ma nea enti a ɛte saa.
No self here now.	Ɔno ankasa biara nni ha mprempren.
On a house of our own.	Wɔ yɛn ankasa fie bi so.
I just can’t get enough of it though.	Me deɛ, me ntumi nnya no deɛ.
We were willing to do that.	Ná yɛwɔ ɔpɛ sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa.
I definitely saw them.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mihuu wɔn.
This is a game for fun.	Eyi yɛ agoru ma anigye.
He would continue to do so.	Ná ɔbɛkɔ so ayɛ saa.
There seems to be no certain truth.	Ɛte sɛ nea nokware biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nokware.
Put them in danger.	Fa wɔn to asiane mu.
But this looks really good.	Nanso eyi hwɛ yiye ankasa.
That much is obvious now.	Saa dodow no ara da adi mprempren.
Positive things in the long run tend to get harder with time.	Nneɛma pa wɔ bere tenten mu taa yɛ den bere a ɛrekɔ so no.
We can help!.	Yebetumi aboa!.
You can’t take me further.	Worentumi mfa me nkɔ akyiri.
These details are important.	Saa nsɛm yi ho hia.
And it was a lot of fun.	Na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
The school year will be tough again.	Sukuu afe no bɛyɛ den bio.
This is not entirely true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
Definitely words to live by.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nsɛm a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde tra ase.
For services to services.	Wɔ nnwuma a wɔyɛ ma nnwuma ho.
About you, about me.	Wo ho asɛm, me ho asɛm.
The girl wasn't there either.	Ná abeawa no nso nni hɔ.
I set my mind to it.	Mede m’adwene sii hɔ.
Money or currency is almost non-existent.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ sika anaa sika a wɔde di dwuma no nni hɔ.
The system is arbitrary and haphazard.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛ nea wɔyɛ no kwa na wɔyɛ no kwa.
He was amazing.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa.
So keep doing that.	Enti kɔ so yɛ saa.
So we do our best.	Enti yɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara.
This, not so much.	Eyi, ɛnyɛ pii saa.
Until you do that again.	Kosi sɛ wobɛyɛ saa bio.
Maybe you do that.	Ebia woyɛ saa.
Talk about what you like.	Ka nea w’ani gye ho no ho asɛm.
The first is the timeline.	Nea edi kan ne bere nhyehyɛe no.
All day long.	Da mũ nyinaa.
The pictures meant something else.	Ná mfonini ahorow no kyerɛ biribi foforo.
Or so it seemed.	Anaasɛ saa na na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte.
What else did the story say?.	Dɛn bio na asɛm no kae?.
Using that information is quite another.	Saa nsɛm no a wode bedi dwuma no yɛ ade foforo koraa.
I have to put that in the back of my head.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede saa asɛm no to me ti akyi.
Home for a few years.	Fie mfe kakraa bi.
I think it should at least be something like .	Misusuw sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ biribi te sɛ .
Surely, there must be a better way.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ.
I'm involved in it.	Mede me ho ahyɛ mu.
The cover story is about you.	Asɛm a ɛwɔ anim no fa wo ho.
Police now believe the story is a hoax.	Mprempren polisifo gye di sɛ asɛm no yɛ atoro.
It wasn’t scary.	Ná ɛnyɛ hu.
We get it amazing.	Yɛn nsa ka no yɛ nwonwa.
There is nothing of the sort in it.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa wɔ mu.
Each cat had remarkably short fur.	Ná ɔkraman biara ho nhwi yɛ tiaa ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
You did tell me that.	Woka kyerɛɛ me saa ampa.
Everyone else doesn’t get that chance.	Obiara a aka no nnya saa hokwan no.
This city is famous for its hot springs.	Saa kurow yi agye din wɔ nsu a ɛyɛ hyew a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho.
This doesn't seem to work very well.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi nyɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
The kids loved it.	Ná mmofra no ani gye ho.
I think this is very true.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ nokware kɛse.
All of these things work well.	Saa nneɛma yi nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye.
Maybe that’s what he would do.	Ebia ɛno ne nea na ɔbɛyɛ.
So has everyone else.	Saa ara na obiara nso ayɛ.
It was a terrible day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ hu.
But he’s happy.	Nanso n’ani gye.
People stay a lot.	Nkurɔfo tra hɔ pii.
All the details are available here.	Nsɛm no nyinaa wɔ ha.
I wasn’t interested in it.	Ná m’ani nnye ho.
The night of the installation.	Anadwo a wɔde sii hɔ.
He didn't know what he would do even if he did.	Ná onnim nea sɛ ɔyɛ saa mpo a, ɔbɛyɛ.
I want to feel that way again.	Mepɛ sɛ mete nka saa bio.
People had friends here.	Ná nkurɔfo wɔ nnamfo wɔ ha.
It is as important as any other.	Ɛho hia te sɛ nea ɛho hia foforo biara.
Your car is gone.	Wo kar no nni hɔ bio.
I can’t imagine how hard that must be.	Mintumi nsusuw sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ den no ho.
They are one and the same.	Wɔyɛ biako na wɔyɛ ade koro.
He stayed with me for many years.	Ɔne me traa mfe pii.
Action was needed on a larger scale.	Ná ɛho hia sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi wɔ ɔkwan kɛse so.
Everyone raised their eyebrows.	Obiara maa n’ani so.
This is still a work in progress.	Eyi da so ara yɛ adwuma a ɛrekɔ so.
This was a good thing to do, he told himself.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ, na eyi yɛ ade pa a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
The idea behind this project is awesome.	Adwene a ɛwɔ saa adwuma yi akyi no yɛ hu.
I don't know if this can work.	Minnim sɛ ebia eyi betumi ayɛ adwuma anaa.
So it should be even.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mpo.
Many, many days.	Nna pii pii.
But this is a new year.	Nanso eyi yɛ afe foforo.
That was the nature of the work.	Saa na na adwuma no te.
The man was something else.	Ná ɔbarima no yɛ biribi foforo.
I feel like I am at home.	Mete nka sɛ mewɔ ofie.
He knew where this man lived.	Ná onim baabi a saa ɔbarima yi te.
Either way, keep it up.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, kɔ so yɛ saa.
He had a lot of good news.	Ná ɔwɔ nsɛm pa pii.
Maybe he really understands it all.	Ebia ɔte ne nyinaa ase ankasa.
Don’t take things for granted.	Mfa nneɛma no nni agoru.
I had no room for them.	Ná minni baabi mma wɔn.
But that was a problem for another day.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ ɔhaw ma da foforo.
I just want you.	Mepɛ wo ara kwa.
At least most of us do.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yɛn mu dodow no ara yɛ saa.
Maybe he’ll tell you.	Ebia ɔbɛka akyerɛ wo.
Not even me.	Ɛnyɛ me mpo.
Cycling was fun, but dangerous.	Ná sakre a wɔde tu kwan no yɛ anigye, nanso na asiane wom.
Hopefully he can come home soon.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ obetumi aba fie nnansa yi ara.
The story is there.	Asɛm no wɔ hɔ.
He scooped up the food.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ aduan no mu.
I had it wrong.	Ná mewɔ no bɔne.
That’s the movie this is!.	Ɛno ne sini a eyi yɛ!.
There was everything to say, there was nothing.	Na biribiara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka, na biribiara nni hɔ.
Beware of the dangerous animals.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ mmoa a wɔn ho yɛ hu no ho.
Or one of the best.	Anaasɛ nea eye sen biara no mu biako.
In about a month.	Wɔ bɛyɛ ɔsram biako mu.
A variety of factors can contribute to this.	Nneɛma ahorow betumi ama eyi aba.
It’s better that way.	Ɛyɛ papa saa kwan no so.
Let him go.	Ma no nkɔ.
We can get jobs.	Yebetumi anya nnwuma.
However, it is not surprising.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nwonwa koraa.
I tell them.	Meka wɔn.
Can you eat the food?	Wubetumi adi aduan?
No time to think about it, you know.	Bere biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho, wunim.
That might not have been such a smart idea.	Ebia na ɛno nyɛ adwene a nyansa wom saa.
Yours and yours and yours.	Wo deɛ ne wo deɛ ne wo deɛ.
I don’t know how they do it.	Minnim sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
Hardly anyone goes to the movies alone.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara nni hɔ a ɔno nkutoo nkɔ sini.
It seemed to be one.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ biako.
I felt happy again.	Metee nka sɛ m’ani agye bio.
He has no idea what he is doing is wrong.	Onni adwene biara sɛ nea ɔreyɛ no yɛ bɔne.
In many, such things did not exist.	Wɔ pii mu no, na nneɛma a ɛte saa nni hɔ.
But that is not the case.	Nanso saa asɛm no nte saa.
Anyway, it's beautiful.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛyɛ fɛ.
Prices are per person.	Nneɛma bo yɛ onipa biara.
I have worked there.	Mayɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ.
He is a little young.	Ɔyɛ abofra kakra.
He was completely cooperative.	Ɔyɛɛ biako koraa.
He put her in jail.	Ɔde no too afiase.
If you bring them back, he’ll be happy.	Sɛ wode wɔn san ba a, n’ani begye ho.
I’m not like anyone else.	Me nte sɛ obiara.
But it was a lot of fun.	Nanso na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
What could he possibly see in her?	Dɛn na ebia obetumi ahu wɔ ne mu?
And that will likely take years.	Na ɛda adi sɛ ɛno begye mfe pii.
Look at what he’s doing.	Hwɛ nea ɔreyɛ.
Each of us did that.	Ná yɛn mu biara yɛ saa.
What happened, happened.	Nea esii no, esii.
There was a time when he even liked her.	Bere bi wɔ hɔ a na n’ani gye ne ho mpo.
October at least.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, October.
He doesn’t know it’s us.	Onnim sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn.
He seemed very articulate.	Ná ɔte sɛ nea ɔka nsɛm yiye.
He didn’t know.	Ná onnim.
That says something.	Ɛno ka biribi.
But this case was much more complicated.	Nanso na asɛm yi mu yɛ den kɛse.
So he had done something.	Enti na wayɛ biribi.
Not on everything, not even everything.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara so, ɛnyɛ biribiara mpo.
The group has been very successful.	Kuw no adi yiye kɛse.
He made it all the way out of the city.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​kwan no nyinaa fi kurow no mu.
I just had to be here.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ ha ara kwa.
I don’t do it anymore.	Menyɛ bio.
Nothing seemed to matter.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara ho nhia.
Keep warm and dry.	Ma wo ho nyɛ hyew na ɛnyɛ hyew.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
Anyway, he doesn't have much right now.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, onni pii mprempren.
I actually had one.	Ná mewɔ bi ankasa.
Children stay with their mother all the time.	Mmofra tra wɔn maame nkyɛn bere nyinaa.
I do the same thing.	Me nso meyɛ saa ara.
I was looking forward to this.	Ná mehwɛ eyi kwan.
People really need this.	Nkurɔfo hia eyi ankasa.
This once worked fine, but now it doesn’t.	Bere bi na eyi yɛ adwuma yiye, nanso mprempren ɛnyɛ adwuma.
The same is true of sex.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nna ho.
That wasn’t true.	Ná ɛno nyɛ nokware.
The absolute best of both of us.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa mu nea eye sen biara koraa.
And he wasn’t the only one.	Na ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na na ɔwɔ hɔ.
We also had music and songs.	Ná yɛwɔ nnwom ne nnwom nso.
He focused on the positive.	Ɔde n’adwene sii nneɛma pa so.
I will be that guy.	Me na mɛyɛ saa ɔbarima no.
Just books, books, books and pictures.	Nhoma, nhoma, nhoma ne mfonini ahorow kɛkɛ.
It was his home.	Ná ɛyɛ ne fie.
Things have to start every moment.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma fi ase bere biara.
It seems strange.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
And the sooner he can do that, the better.	Na dodow a obetumi ayɛ saa ntɛm no, dodow no ara na eye.
I want to know what is going on here.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha.
The great industry is gone.	Nnwuma kɛse no nni hɔ bio.
You have some of it.	Wowɔ bi.
I knew that was the reason.	Ná minim sɛ ɛno ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
Your time is short.	Wo bere yɛ tiaa.
However, it is good.	Nanso, eye.
My good eye never quite improved.	M’ani pa no ankɔ yiye koraa da.
But there was still money.	Nanso na sika da so ara wɔ hɔ.
I really meant it too.	Ná me nso mepɛ sɛ meka ankasa.
This happens too often.	Eyi taa ba dodo.
I'm still there.	Meda so ara wɔ hɔ.
I'm important to you.	Me ho hia wo.
How does that work? 	Ɔkwan bɛn so na ɛno yɛ adwuma?
Be sure to add enough water.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wode nsu a ɛdɔɔso bɛka ho.
He might have done it this year.	Ebia na wayɛ no afe yi.
It has to work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
Two things can happen from here.	Nneɛma abien betumi asi afi ha.
I had a few errands to run.	Ná mewɔ nnwuma kakraa bi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
Follow the plan carefully and stay on track.	Di nhyehyɛe no akyi yiye na kɔ so tra kwan no so.
I want to know why.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea enti a ɛte saa.
He is in a wonderful mood.	Ɔwɔ adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa mu.
Many people knew.	Ná nnipa pii nim.
Most likely he knew her personally.	Ɛda adi kɛse sɛ na ɔno ankasa nim no.
This went on for a long time.	Eyi kɔɔ so bere tenten bi.
It has a structure, a structure.	Ɛwɔ nhyehyɛe, nhyehyɛe bi.
Dog the other day.	Ɔkraman da bi a atwam no.
But hours later, they felt much better.	Nanso nnɔnhwerew bi akyi no, wɔn ho tɔɔ wɔn kɛse.
You should do this several times throughout the day.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi mpɛn pii kosi da no mu.
I have to say that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ.
But it was one of those nights.	Nanso na ɛyɛ saa anadwo no mu biako.
There is nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
However, that is not the point.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
He loves going to this city.	N’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛkɔ kurow yi mu.
However, this is an academically challenging task.	Nanso, eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den wɔ adesua kwan so.
They were much stronger than he was.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ den sen no koraa.
We hope you will join us!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wobɛka yɛn ho!.
I made good use of that name.	Mede saa din no dii dwuma yiye.
As you probably do.	Sɛnea ebia woyɛ no.
We can’t have that.	Yɛrentumi nnya saa.
I wanted to say that.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka saa.
Both old and new will be here.	Dedaw ne foforo nyinaa bɛba ha.
It was a lot of fun.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
You want someone you like.	Wopɛ obi a w’ani gye ne ho.
And we have to live with the same.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde saa ara tra ase.
Someone has to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ saa.
In order to be good.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wobɛyɛ papa.
How could he just forget.	Ɛbɛyɛ dɛn na ne werɛ afi ara kwa.
Mother enjoyed it there.	Maame ani gyee ho wɔ hɔ.
Eat what you want.	Di nea wopɛ.
It’s still everybody.	Ɛda so ara yɛ obiara.
Another phenomenon.	Ade foforo a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
And, boy, does it have the music.	Na, abarimaa, so ɛwɔ nnwom no.
This table is used to identify different types of products.	Wɔde saa pon yi kyerɛ nneɛma ahorow a wɔde ayɛ nneɛma ahorow.
No one comes to the door.	Obiara mma ɔpon no ano.
Most people can’t see that.	Nnipa dodow no ara ntumi nhu saa.
I can always go.	Metumi akɔ bere nyinaa.
But he knew it was.	Nanso na onim sɛ ɛte saa.
I saw him.	Mihuu no.
We envy them for their weaknesses.	Yɛn ani bere wɔn wɔ wɔn a wɔyɛ mmerɛw no ho.
I believe he has many plans for me.	Migye di sɛ ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe pii ma me.
There was an accident on the highway.	Akwanhyia bi sii wɔ ɔkwan kɛse no so.
Their own	Wɔn ho
I'm all scared.	Me suro nyinaa.
I didn’t even know how he felt.	Ná minnim sɛnea ɔte nka mpo.
I have to get involved.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede me ho hyɛ mu.
I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong.	Me ntumi nhu nea me reyɛ bɔne.
I can’t sleep lately.	Mintumi nna nnansa yi.
My father worked at night.	Ná me papa yɛ adwuma anadwo.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Look at the names on their clothes.	Hwɛ din ahorow a ɛwɔ wɔn ntade so no.
So there is something.	Enti biribi wɔ hɔ.
What a great picture.	Mfonini kɛse bɛn ara ni.
This seems like a perfect thing.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ ade a edi mũ.
That might be fine, though.	Nanso, ebia ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
You are more manly than he is.	Woyɛ ɔbarima sen ɔno.
The shoes fit your feet comfortably.	Mpaboa no hyɛ wo nan mu yiye.
You have time.	Wowɔ bere.
We were out of town.	Ná yɛwɔ kurow no akyi.
Thank you for going with me today.	Meda wo ase sɛ wo ne me kɔ nnɛ.
We are the majority.	Yɛn na yɛyɛ dodow no ara.
I couldn’t take the child now.	Na mintumi mfa abofra no nkɔ mprempren.
She had only one child.	Ná ɔwɔ abofra biako pɛ.
I felt a lot of pain.	Metee yaw kɛse.
This is not a lie.	Eyi nyɛ atoro.
That’s not hard either.	Ɛno nso nyɛ den.
And you certainly have that.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wowɔ saa.
But never take it.	Nanso mfa no da.
Is there time left?	So bere aka?
It appears to be a basement.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ dan bi a ɛwɔ fam.
Or they tell you something that is not true.	Anaasɛ wɔka biribi a ɛnyɛ nokware kyerɛ wo.
This should come as no surprise to anyone.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ obiara nwonwa.
There was nothing remarkable.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This is about us.	Yɛn ho asɛm yi.
But he doesn’t.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa.
But maybe that’s a good thing.	Nanso ebia ɛno yɛ ade pa.
I know he is very worried about her.	Minim sɛ ne ho asɛm haw no yiye.
Or maybe they are so new.	Anaasɛ ebia wɔyɛ foforo saa.
I want the real thing.	Mepɛ nea ɛte ankasa.
Consider the first factor.	Susuw ade a edi kan no ho hwɛ.
I want to hear it.	Mepɛ sɛ mete.
None of them are like that.	Wɔn mu biara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
They are true friends.	Wɔyɛ nnamfo ankasa.
The only problem is that’s not true.	Ɔhaw no ara ne sɛ ɛno nyɛ nokware.
His clothes were still the same.	Ná ne ntade da so ara yɛ pɛ.
But that just means they have to.	Nanso ɛno kyerɛ ara ne sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Food was scarce.	Ná aduan ho yɛ na.
The door closed behind them.	Ɔpon no too mu wɔ wɔn akyi.
It certainly felt like it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
They do this this year.	Wɔyɛ saa afe yi.
Thank you for the great work.	Meda mo ase wɔ adwuma kɛse no ho.
Any man can see that.	Ɔbarima biara betumi ahu saa.
Clearly, that was not their intention.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛnyɛ wɔn adwene a ɛte saa.
You want a house.	Wopɛ fie.
I feel for the child.	Mete nka ma abofra no.
But the idea is the same.	Nanso adwene no yɛ ade koro.
No one seems to understand anyone.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara nte obiara ase.
And in that case .	Na wɔ saa tebea no mu no .
We have all kinds of people in our party.	Yɛwɔ nnipa ahorow nyinaa wɔ yɛn apontow no mu.
That’s right, for everything.	Ɛte saa, wɔ biribiara ho.
Say thank you.	Ka sɛ meda wo ase.
First, it’s not cheap.	Nea edi kan no, ɛnyɛ nea ne bo yɛ mmerɛw.
It’s so easy to do.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ.
Here is the best thing to do with them.	Ade a eye sen biara a wo ne wɔn bɛyɛ ni.
But this is also, in my opinion, a good thing.	Nanso eyi nso, wɔ m’adwene mu no, ɛyɛ ade pa.
That surprised me.	Ɛno maa me ho dwiriw me.
I’m so excited about this.	M’ani gye eyi ho kɛse.
Nothing to take home.	Biribiara nni hɔ a mede bɛkɔ fie.
It was, and it isn’t anymore.	Na ɛte saa, na ɛnyɛ bio.
As a matter of fact, he never does.	Sɛnea ɛte no, ɔnyɛ saa da.
You do and he doesn’t, just so far.	Woyɛ na ɔno nso nyɛ, de besi nnɛ ara kwa.
I’m so excited about this.	M’ani gye eyi ho kɛse.
The house is not beautiful.	Ofie no mu nyɛ fɛ.
However, this isn’t so bad.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ bɔne saa.
I have no classes for this.	Minni adesua biara mma eyi.
But that’s all for today.	Nanso ɛno ara ne nnɛ de.
They are the reason we do it.	Wɔn ne nea enti a yɛyɛ saa.
It looks really great.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ kɛse ankasa.
And that was a problem.	Na ɛno yɛ ɔhaw.
And he didn’t have the resources.	Na na onni nneɛma a ɔde bɛyɛ.
You can see her now, in her bedroom.	Wubetumi ahu no mprempren, wɔ ne mpa mu.
I’d really love it.	M’ani begye ho ankasa.
This house is beautiful.	Saa ofie yi yɛ fɛ.
They never get the point.	Wɔn nsa nka asɛm no da.
Something no one else of significance has ever done.	Biribi a obi foforo biara a ɛho hia nyɛɛ da.
He did a great, great job.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma kɛse, kɛse.
You are never alone.	Ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo da.
Maybe it wasn’t.	Ebia na ɛnte saa.
That day it wasn’t.	Saa da no na ɛnte saa.
The instant he touched her he knew.	Ntɛm ara a ɔde ne nsa kaa no no na onim.
There was no such thing.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
Not this time around.	Ɛnyɛ saa bere yi.
The same is true of information.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nsɛm ho.
And it still does.	Na ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
The car was full of people and their belongings.	Ná nnipa ne wɔn nneɛma ahyɛ kar no mu ma.
He was a bright one.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hyew.
But also happiness.	Nanso anigye nso.
I was much worse than now.	Ná meyɛ bɔne sen mprempren koraa.
I gave you what you wanted.	Mede nea wopɛ maa wo.
She was a good girl.	Ná ɔyɛ abeawa pa.
Many things.	Nneɛma pii.
Just the two of us.	Yɛn baanu nkutoo.
Faster than you think.	Ntɛmntɛm sen sɛnea wususuw.
I really feel it.	Mete nka ampa.
He had hope.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso.
There was no singing in his music.	Ná nnwom biara nni ne nnwom no mu.
That is their right.	Ɛno ne wɔn hokwan.
I just want it on paper.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛwɔ krataa so kɛkɛ.
He is the one who does it.	Ɔno ne nea ɔyɛ.
For him, this was not a pleasant news.	Wɔ ne fam no, na eyi nyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
This is certainly true.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
It was an awfully brief moment of recognition.	Na ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi a wɔde hu no wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu so.
They are nice and soft, and a bit hard.	Wɔyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ mmerɛw, na ɛyɛ den kakra.
And it’s all from you.	Na ne nyinaa fi wo.
That is why you are my son.	Ɛno nti na woyɛ me ba no.
He didn't want to be late.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔbɛka akyi.
You can run it.	Wubetumi atu mmirika akɔ so.
We are the people we are.	Yɛyɛ nnipa a yɛyɛ.
It’s not like that.	Ɛnyɛ saa.
Moreover, we are all human.	Bio nso, yɛn nyinaa yɛ nnipa.
They all say the same thing.	Wɔn nyinaa ka asɛm koro.
My hands were strong.	Ná me nsa ano yɛ den.
And if he doesn't	Na sɛ ɔnyɛ saa a .
If that’s true, great.	Sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware a, ɛyɛ kɛse.
They were interested in the story.	Wɔn ani gyee asɛm no ho.
Will you do that	So wobɛyɛ saa
Just one last test.	Sɔhwɛ biako pɛ a etwa to.
Eat them when they are young, firm, and fresh.	Di wɔn bere a wɔyɛ mmofra, wɔyɛ den, na wɔyɛ foforo no.
It is a small amount of food.	Ɛyɛ aduan kakraa bi.
This book is incomplete, and full of errors.	Nhoma yi nni mũ, na mfomso ahyɛ mu ma.
It was a wonderful story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
People don’t always do what they seem.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na nkurɔfo yɛ nea ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ.
People are like that, too	Nkurɔfo nso te saa
Everyone is happy.	Obiara ani gye.
That thought made her feel a little better.	Saa adwene no maa ne ho tɔɔ no kakra.
It was happening again.	Ná ɛrekɔ so bio.
This statement is true.	Saa asɛm yi yɛ nokware.
There is more to this story here.	Nneɛma pii wɔ saa asɛm yi ho wɔ ha.
However, not often.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii.
So, that’s a good thing.	Enti, ɛno yɛ ade pa.
It was really good.	Ná eye ankasa.
The chances are not good.	Hokwan ahorow no nyɛ papa.
It was fresh, current and great.	Na ɛyɛ foforo, ɛyɛ mprempren de na ɛyɛ kɛse.
He’s not good.	Ɔnyɛ papa.
For me, but you know, not really.	Me fam no, nanso wunim, ɛnyɛ ankasa.
It was harder and more final than before.	Ná ɛyɛ den na na ɛyɛ nea etwa to sen kan no.
I don’t know who did that.	Minnim onii a ɔyɛɛ saa.
This is not just an opinion, this is a reality.	Eyi nyɛ adwene bi kɛkɛ, eyi yɛ nokware.
It was surprisingly ineffective.	Na ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma.
Give it a good start.	Ma no fi ase yiye.
It’s very cold.	Ɛyɛ awɔw kɛse.
Quick and fast.	Ntɛmntɛm ne ntɛmntɛm.
It feels so amazing.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
People do amazing things with their imagination.	Nkurɔfo de wɔn adwene yɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I put it aside to enjoy later.	Mede too nkyɛn sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a m’ani begye ho akyiri yi.
The first one is a little easier.	Nea edi kan no yɛ mmerɛw kakra.
Many interesting things happened.	Nsɛm a ɛyɛ anigye pii sii.
It wasn’t like it was at all, you know.	Na ɛnyɛ sɛnea na ɛte no koraa, wunim.
I could have it at any time.	Ná metumi anya bi bere biara.
Everyone started kicking.	Obiara fii ase de ne nan bɔɔ fam.
He seemed to enjoy this.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye eyi ho.
The new product is very popular.	Ade foforo no yɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse.
Now I see something I need to do.	Seesei mihu biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
I know he is there.	Minim sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ.
Make people happy.	Ma nkurɔfo ani nnye.
Just be right here, right now.	Yɛ ha yi ara kɛkɛ, seesei ara.
Add your favorites to make a new book.	Fa nea w’ani gye ho no ka ho na fa yɛ nhoma foforo.
These animals can reach a certain length.	Saa mmoa yi betumi adu tenten bi ho.
They are fun and easy.	Wɔyɛ anigye na ɛnyɛ den.
I expect better play from the offense.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ agoru a eye sen biara bɛba afi mfomso no mu.
My wife and children are still there.	Me yere ne me mma da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Mine is a lie.	Minni atoro.
Don’t be afraid of it.	Mma w’ani nnye ho.
There was something about him.	Ná biribi wɔ ne ho.
Be careful to do so.	Hwɛ yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
But think about it.	Nanso susuw ho hwɛ.
He got involved with them.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ wɔn mu.
I just feel so strongly.	Mete nka denneennen ara kwa.
Nothing was the same anymore.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a na ɛte saa bio.
I cared about our whole school system.	Ná yɛn sukuu nhyehyɛe no nyinaa ho asɛm hia me.
And so did his wife.	Na ne yere nso.
And so did his mother.	Na ne maame nso.
You can’t go wrong with this one.	Worentumi nkɔ mfomso wɔ eyi ho.
All three elements do not need to recognize each other.	Ɛho nhia sɛ nneɛma abiɛsa no nyinaa hu wɔn ho wɔn ho.
What you are doing matters.	Nea woreyɛ no ho hia.
You don’t have to be late for classes.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woka akyi wɔ adesua mu.
This can go on for days.	Eyi betumi akɔ so nna pii.
Things are never quite right.	Nneɛma nkɔ yiye koraa da.
This was never the case.	Ná eyi nyɛ saa da.
He can come here.	Obetumi aba ha.
They were used.	Wɔde dii dwuma.
They speak the truth, but they were human.	Wɔka nokware no, nanso na wɔyɛ nnipa.
He didn't want to hear from his mother.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔte ne maame asɛm no.
He did so.	Ɔyɛɛ saa.
He made it seem as if it didn't matter to him.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​te sɛ nea ɛnyɛ hwee mma no.
It was packed.	Ná ɛyɛ ma.
I thought you didn’t like it.	Misusuwii sɛ w’ani nnye ho.
And you remember them well.	Na wokae wɔn yiye.
But yours is the same.	Nanso wo de no te saa.
They really do.	Wɔyɛ saa ankasa.
There’s a cat in my bed.	Ɔkraman bi wɔ me mpa so.
I can't leave here yet.	Mintumi mfi ha de besi nnɛ.
Which may indeed exist.	Nea ebia ɛwɔ hɔ ampa.
What you do goes far beyond that.	Nea woyɛ no kɔ akyiri sen saa koraa.
I know what the problem is.	Minim nea ɔhaw no yɛ.
The team immediately took the lead.	Kuw no dii kan ntɛm ara.
I can never really see him.	Mintumi nhu no ankasa da.
His mind told him so.	N’adwene ka kyerɛɛ no ​​saa.
I can’t do it anymore.	Mintumi nyɛ bio.
It had an interesting layout.	Na ɛwɔ nhyehyɛe bi a ɛyɛ anigye.
Do not use your arms or hands.	Mfa wo nsa anaa wo nsa nni dwuma.
None of that had worked.	Ná ɛno mu biara anyɛ adwuma.
Watch my movie.	Hwɛ me sini no.
Do it every day.	Yɛ no da biara da.
You had the gun.	Ná wowɔ tuo no.
It seems very strange to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye ma me.
I have to keep talking.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so kasa.
We had set up two or three new ones that afternoon.	Ná yɛde foforo abien anaa abiɛsa asi hɔ saa awia no.
Eventually, he does.	Awiei koraa no, ɔyɛ saa.
He never uses it either.	Ɔno nso mfa nni dwuma da.
This had not gone too well.	Ná eyi nyɛɛ yiye dodo.
As in, one of them.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ, biako mu.
And the most beautiful.	Na nea ɛyɛ fɛ sen biara.
You’ll really enjoy it.	W’ani begye ho ankasa.
There is a need for immediate action.	Ɛho hia sɛ wɔyɛ ade ntɛm ara.
I shouldn’t touch him.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ mede me nsa ka no.
We could just leave tomorrow.	Ná yebetumi afi hɔ ɔkyena ara kwa.
But here come the last two.	Nanso ha na abien a etwa to no ba.
It feels like something real.	Ɛte nka sɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nokware.
Many people asked me the same question.	Nnipa pii bisaa me asɛm koro no ara.
When you see him, you tell him that for me.	Sɛ wuhu no a, woka saa kyerɛ no ma me.
A lot happened in a short period of time.	Pii sii wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
And repeat the story again.	Na san ka asɛm no bio.
The drought intensified last year.	Ɔpɛ no mu yɛ den afe a etwaam no.
Many of these.	Eyi mu pii.
But he could handle that.	Nanso na obetumi adi saa asɛm no ho dwuma.
So full of power.	Enti tumi ahyɛ mu ma.
You have to keep making music.	Ɛsɛ sɛ kɔ so yɛ nnwom.
And, what else.	Na, dɛn bio.
He knows everything.	Onim biribiara.
It’s not a game.	Ɛnyɛ agoru biara.
However, there was no such power.	Nanso, na tumi a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ.
Movies do it all the time.	Sini ahorow yɛ no bere nyinaa.
There may be another reason.	Ebia biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ a enti a ɛte saa.
That lunch was amazing!.	Saa awia aduan no yɛɛ nwonwa!.
You have to work on it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho adwuma.
It’s been a while.	Ɛyɛ bere bi.
You use that statement.	Wode saa asɛm no di dwuma.
We were once friends.	Bere bi na yɛyɛ nnamfo.
His team won the game yesterday.	Ne kuw no dii nkonim wɔ agoru no mu nnɛra.
In this approach, a forward-looking system is used.	Wɔ saa kwan yi so no, wɔde nhyehyɛe a wɔde hwɛ anim di dwuma.
The bus was packed.	Ná bɔs no ayɛ ma.
This worked for me recently.	Eyi yɛɛ adwuma maa me nnansa yi ara.
But that was why.	Nanso na ɛno nti.
He can continue to do so.	Obetumi akɔ so ayɛ saa.
None of the items could be used.	Nneɛma no mu biara antumi mfa nni dwuma.
And in this case, he has the last word.	Na eyi mu no, ɔno na ɔwɔ asɛm a etwa to.
But the problem may go deeper.	Nanso ebia ɔhaw no bɛkɔ akyiri.
And watch a lot of movies.	Na hwɛ sini pii.
It’s not as easy as it sounds.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛte no.
I can tell you this, though.	Nanso, metumi aka eyi akyerɛ wo.
I can’t think of anything to say to him.	Mintumi nsusuw biribiara a mɛka akyerɛ no ho.
He was quick to respond.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm yɛɛ ho biribi.
You can’t draw any conclusions.	Worentumi mfa nsɛm biara mma awiei.
My head hurt.	Me ti yɛɛ me yaw.
Hope and joy.	Anidaso ne anigye.
Talking about why they do what they do.	Nea enti a wɔyɛ nea wɔyɛ no ho asɛm a wɔka.
He knew exactly what time he had.	Ná onim bere a ɔwɔ no yiye.
That might be a problem.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ ɔhaw.
And you	Na wo .
It was already a very long night.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo tenten paa dedaw.
Very exciting too.	Anigye kɛse nso.
But they certainly do.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Not everyone has to do both.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ abien no nyinaa.
Right here at home.	Ha yi ara wɔ fie.
How much does it cost?.	Ɛho ka yɛ ahe?.
On the one hand, this is true.	Ɔkwan biako so no, eyi yɛ nokware.
No famous animals.	Mmoa a agye din biara nni hɔ.
Maybe you should go with him?	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no kɔ?
I'll bring him.	Mede no bɛba.
Learning is important.	Adesua ho hia.
There really should be plenty of both.	Ɛsɛ sɛ abien no nyinaa pii wɔ hɔ ankasa.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho.
So thank you, me.	Enti meda wo ase, me.
We have to do it for our children.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ma yɛn mma.
I have a new job.	Mewɔ adwuma foforo.
It was also the most exciting.	Ná ɛno nso na ɛyɛ anigye sen biara.
I feel like I’m sleeping.	Mete nka sɛ meda.
In this case, it is very difficult.	Wɔ eyi mu no, ɛyɛ den yiye.
You have enough work for the whole year.	Wowɔ adwuma a ɛdɔɔso ma afe mũ no nyinaa.
The number of cases was the same.	Ná asɛm no dodow te saa ara.
Not one that everyone can see.	Ɛnyɛ biara a obiara betumi ahu.
Not a good ending at all.	Ɛnyɛ awiei pa koraa.
You are one of the good guys.	Woyɛ nnipa pa no mu biako.
I totally get it.	Me nsa ka no koraa.
I couldn’t do anything.	Ná mintumi nyɛ hwee.
Maybe he just likes to use it.	Ebia n’ani gye ho ara kwa sɛ ɔde bedi dwuma.
This may sound strange.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He slid his hands down	Ɔde ne nsa too fam
The feedback is poor.	Nsɛm a wɔde ba no nyɛ papa.
It was the best of the best.	Ná ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
I don't care if the information is true or not.	Sɛ nsɛm no yɛ nokware anaasɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛnyɛ me asɛm.
I don’t do that either.	Menyɛ saa ara.
Maybe he'll give it to whoever was with him.	Ebia ɔde bɛma obiara a na ɔne no wɔ hɔ no.
He owes us.	Ɔde yɛn ka.
Everything was hot or warm.	Ná biribiara yɛ hyew anaasɛ ɛyɛ hyew.
Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Ebia ɛnyɛ hwee.
That is the only reason to do so.	Ɛno nkutoo ne ade a enti ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
It’s so nice.	Ɛte saa.
Keep going home.	Kɔ so kɔ fie.
The one who rules the most	Nea odi tumi kɛse
All year round.	Afe mũ nyinaa.
And another, his.	Na foforo nso, ne de.
It was the last big chapter.	Na ɛyɛ ti kɛse a etwa to.
I didn’t know that.	Ná minnim saa.
For years of a kind.	Mfe pii a ɛyɛ ɔkwan bi so.
At least that might be faster.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ebia ɛno bɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
We were in a crowded place.	Ná yɛwɔ baabi a nnipa pii wɔ.
I want him here right now.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔwɔ ha mprempren ara.
Hope you enjoy it!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho!.
Be sure to tell your friends about us!.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wobɛka yɛn ho asɛm akyerɛ wo nnamfo!.
Now he is the only one alive.	Seesei ɔno nkutoo na ɔte ase.
We were always connected to each other.	Ná wɔde yɛn ho abɔ yɛn ho yɛn ho ho bere nyinaa.
He is my life.	Ɔno ne me nkwa.
The car hit the other car from behind.	Kar no fi akyi bɔɔ kar foforo no.
So would that be.	Saa ara na anka ɛno nso bɛyɛ.
You can find it here, here, and here.	Wubetumi ahu wɔ ha, ha, ne ha.
All those awesome kids.	Saa mmofra a wɔn ho yɛ hu no nyinaa.
But the story had surprises.	Nanso na asɛm no wɔ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
The same is true now.	Saa ara na ɛte mprempren.
There is one for you too.	Biako wɔ hɔ ma wo nso.
I should have thought about that one.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw saa biako no ho.
Something real, really.	Biribi ankasa, ampa.
The important thing was happening.	Ná ade a ɛho hia no rekɔ so.
Many of these animals are very similar to humans.	Mmoa yi mu pii te sɛ nnipa yiye.
Like packages.	Te sɛ nneɛma a wɔde ahyɛ mu.
I had nothing to say to any of them.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a mɛka akyerɛ wɔn mu biara.
So much happiness.	Anigye pii saa.
There was no need to do so.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Or maybe this one.	Anaasɛ ebia eyi.
My house is nearby.	Me fie bɛn hɔ.
This is happening too fast.	Eyi rekɔ so ntɛmntɛm dodo.
And he didn’t want another one.	Na na ɔmpɛ foforo nso.
Obviously, this should never be done.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi da.
It is neither good nor bad.	Ɛnyɛ papa anaa bɔne biara.
We both do, obviously.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛ, ɛda adi sɛ.
We can’t get water.	Yɛrentumi nnya nsu.
I knew that wasn't the point.	Ná minim sɛ ɛnyɛ asɛm no ne asɛm no.
For now, it’s just water.	Mprempren de, ɛyɛ nsu ara kwa.
There is no way.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ.
It was uncertain who did it.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware sɛ hena na ɔyɛɛ saa.
The test was very difficult.	Ná sɔhwɛ no yɛ den yiye.
I can see that in you.	Metumi ahu saa wɔ wo mu.
Most everyone knows this.	Obiara fã kɛse no ara nim eyi.
He liked the novelty.	N’ani gyee nea ɛyɛ foforo no ho.
No one really knows.	Obiara nnim ankasa.
That seems to be the first of very many.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ne nea edi kan wɔ pii paa mu.
He was the nicest guy there.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ sen biara wɔ hɔ.
This is obviously complicated.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi yɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
Take a dog out.	Fa kraman fi adi.
Not surprising at all.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
He painted a picture of himself.	Ɔyɛɛ ne ho mfonini.
These factors are beyond the control of policy makers.	Saa nneɛma yi yɛ nea wɔn a wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe no ntumi nni so.
The work had been going on for a long time.	Ná adwuma no akɔ so bere tenten ni.
Turn down that way.	Dan kɔ fam saa kwan no so.
He will be my good room.	Ɔbɛyɛ me dan pa.
I have included them both.	Mede wɔn baanu nyinaa aka ho.
We have a job to do.	Yɛwɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
I’m a musician.	M’ani gye nnwom ho.
It was always great.	Na ɛyɛ kɛse bere nyinaa.
The room was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ dan no mu ma.
Someone will drive a better car.	Obi bɛka kar a eye sen saa.
He had a wide variety of interests.	Ná n’ani gye nneɛma ahorow pii ho.
In any case.	Wɔ tebea biara mu.
So that shouldn’t be an issue.	Enti ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm.
It’s a beautiful car.	Ɛyɛ kar a ɛyɛ fɛ.
There are a lot of good people here.	Nnipa pa pii wɔ ha.
I need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
But what happened shocked everyone.	Nanso nea esii no maa obiara ho dwiriw no.
It was like a.	Ná ɛte sɛ a.
The movie must be over.	Ɛsɛ sɛ sini no aba awiei.
Just create something.	Bɔ biribi kɛkɛ.
Can you do the test in one direction?	So wubetumi ayɛ sɔhwɛ no wɔ ɔkwan biako so?
You know it doesn’t work like that.	Wunim sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma saa.
It’s too cold.	Awɔw dodo.
There was a full moon last night.	Ná ɔsram ayɛ ma anadwo a etwaam no.
We both felt like someone was in the house.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa tee nka sɛ obi wɔ fie hɔ.
The date was the next step.	Ná da no yɛ ade a edi hɔ.
And it was and still is just beautiful.	Na na ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa na ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
So is the power.	Saa ara na tumi no nso te.
What he says is very true.	Nea ɔka no yɛ nokware paa.
Time keeps marching on.	Bere kɔ so nantew kɔ so.
So next time, think for a moment.	Enti bere foforo no, susuw ho kakra.
He wanted to be with her.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne no bɔ.
I didn’t think anyone could go that fast.	Na minsusuw sɛ obi betumi akɔ ntɛmntɛm saa.
I wrapped my arms around her.	Mede me nsa bɔɔ ne mu.
And that’s just for dinner.	Na ɛno yɛ anwummere aduan nkutoo.
Everything else does.	Biribiara a aka no yɛ saa.
First of all, we recently had money.	Nea edi kan koraa no, nnansa yi ara na na yɛwɔ sika.
It will be painful, no doubt.	Ɛbɛyɛ yaw, akyinnye biara nni ho.
It wasn’t in a child’s room.	Na ɛnyɛ abofra dan mu.
I enjoyed the moment.	M’ani gyee bere no ho.
He looked at her measuredly.	Ɔde susuw anim hwɛɛ no.
Can anyone help me with this?.	So obi betumi aboa me wɔ eyi ho?.
He would do the same now.	Ná ɔno nso bɛyɛ saa ara mprempren.
One other thing, too.	Ade foforo biako nso.
Just two shots.	Tuo abien pɛ.
You know this as well as we do.	Wunim eyi yiye sɛnea yɛn nso wunim.
Mine went quite well.	Me de no kɔɔ yiye koraa.
My height, give or take.	Me tenten, ma anaa fa.
They were his last words.	Ná ɛyɛ ne nsɛm a etwa to.
At the time, it probably didn’t matter.	Saa bere no, ebia na ɛnyɛ hwee.
But you never know.	Nanso wunnim da.
Otherwise, pretty much the same.	Anyɛ saa a, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte saa ara.
On the morning of the accident.	Anɔpa a akwanhyia no sii no.
This is too important.	Eyi ho hia dodo.
This is not one.	Eyi nyɛ biako.
This is equally disturbing.	Eyi nso haw adwene saa ara.
The painting is in excellent condition.	Mfonini no wɔ tebea pa mu.
For now, anyway.	Mprempren de, sɛnea ɛte biara.
So it’s true.	Enti ɛyɛ nokware.
There was nothing so terrible about a room, after all.	Na biribiara nni dan bi mu a ɛyɛ hu saa, ne nyinaa akyi no.
It was good for me.	Ná eye ma me.
I really didn’t have to.	Ankasa na enhia sɛ meyɛ saa.
His friends don’t like him either.	Ne nnamfo nso ani nnye no ho.
I hope this is not a mistake.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ eyi nyɛ mfomso.
This is a remarkable one.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa.
They have to work as a team.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma sɛ kuw.
We are in terrible danger just being in this system.	Yɛwɔ asiane a ɛyɛ hu mu sɛ yɛwɔ nhyehyɛe yi mu ara kwa.
It’s not the way it is.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛte no.
This is what that looks like.	Eyi ne sɛnea ɛno te.
A child can see it.	Abofra betumi ahu.
I think he can do whatever he wants.	Misusuw sɛ obetumi ayɛ nea ɔpɛ biara.
He was shocked.	Ná ne ho dwiriw no.
Say all you want.	Ka nea wopɛ nyinaa ho asɛm.
You have to tell me about yourself.	Wo ara na ɛsɛ sɛ woka wo ho asɛm kyerɛ me.
But it’s still going on.	Nanso ɛda so ara kɔ so.
The elderly man could still hear every word.	Ná ɔbarima a ne mfe akɔ anim no da so ara te asɛm biara.
The accident happened in a moment.	Akwanhyia no sii wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
The displays are great.	Nneɛma a wɔde kyerɛ no yɛ kɛse.
I thought there was something wrong.	Misusuwii sɛ mfomso bi wɔ hɔ.
How beautiful it is.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ fɛ.
That’s what a professional would do.	Saa na na obi a onim adwuma yiye bɛyɛ.
I thought you should know.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
There were no comments.	Ná nsɛm biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛka ho asɛm.
It looks beautiful.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
And I can’t take it.	Na mintumi mfa.
Does this mean the same thing.	So eyi kyerɛ ade koro no ara.
He could be you or me.	Obetumi ayɛ wo anaa me.
It’s old but beautiful.	Ɛyɛ dedaw nanso ɛyɛ fɛ.
Consider.	Hwɛ.
But there were no people.	Nanso na nnipa biara nni hɔ.
And that’s just part of the problem.	Na ɛno yɛ ɔhaw no fã bi kɛkɛ.
Play when it’s nice and warm.	Di agoru bere a ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ hyew no.
I hadn’t thought about him in years.	Ná minsusuw ne ho mfe pii ni.
Everyone has money.	Obiara wɔ sika.
But that is not possible.	Nanso ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
The accident happened yesterday.	Akwanhyia no sii nnɛra.
We both heard this guy.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa tee saa ɔbarima yi.
I loved the way this started out.	M’ani gyee ɔkwan a eyi faa so fii ase no ho.
This is not a mistake.	Eyi nyɛ mfomso.
I wanted to do something big.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi kɛse bi.
That is a serious mistake.	Ɛno yɛ mfomso kɛse.
She is a very nice person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Everyone’s mother.	Obiara maame.
Consider? 	Hwɛ?
I hope you can see that.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi ahu saa.
And that’s exactly what has happened.	Na ɛno ara ne nea asi.
But that’s just how this business works.	Nanso saa ara na saa adwuma yi yɛ adwuma.
He thinks we can handle it.	Osusuw sɛ yebetumi adi ho dwuma.
However, he doesn’t.	Nanso, ɔnyɛ saa.
It’s a.	Ɛyɛ a.
There would never have been time.	Anka bere nni hɔ da.
The front door was at the back of the house.	Ná anim pon no wɔ ofie no akyi.
Tell me what happened.	Ka nea esii no kyerɛ me.
It was far too late.	Ná akyɛ dodo koraa.
It’s a wonderful story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He made his way to the front desk.	Ɔyɛɛ ne kwan kɔɔ pon a ɛwɔ anim no so.
There is so much to do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
A dress, folks.	Atade bi, nkurɔfo.
Not just one shot.	Ɛnyɛ tuo biako pɛ.
I had to be more careful.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye kɛse.
Drive the car carefully.	Ka kar no yiye.
Goods must be supplied as is and as available.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde nneɛma no ma sɛnea ɛte ne sɛnea ɛwɔ hɔ.
This makes it an interesting car at an affordable price.	Eyi ma ɛyɛ kar a ɛyɛ anigye a ne bo yɛ den.
It’s still a pretty good game.	Ɛda so ara yɛ agoru a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He’s not my type.	Ɔnyɛ me su.
It’s right there.	Ɛwɔ hɔ ara.
But it didn’t matter much.	Nanso na ɛho nhia pii.
I had a meltdown last week.	Me ho yɛɛ me hyew dapɛn a etwaam no.
Use it when necessary.	Fa di dwuma bere a ɛho hia no.
The boy was very sensitive.	Ná abarimaa no yɛ obi a ɔte nka yiye.
That’s obviously expensive.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛno bo yɛ den.
Just for you.	Wo nkutoo nti.
I will serve it at room temperature.	Mede bɛma wɔ dan mu hyew mu.
People respond to it.	Nkurɔfo yɛ ho biribi.
And yet they must.	Na nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Let him do so as soon as possible.	Ma ɔnyɛ saa ntɛm ara sɛnea obetumi.
It’s a very rare person who is alive, who is really alive.	Ɛyɛ onipa a ne ho yɛ na yiye a ɔte ase, a ɔte ase ankasa.
Most of them are there all day.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara wɔ hɔ da mũ nyinaa.
And we got it.	Na yɛn nsa kaa.
And as time went on, the situation only got worse.	Na bere kɔɔ so no, tebea no mu yɛɛ den ara kwa.
It was aimed at me.	Ná wɔde asi me so.
And this is also a surprise.	Na eyi nso yɛ nwonwa.
But that didn’t happen.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na esii.
He knows their language.	Onim wɔn kasa.
I need to work on that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa adwuma no ho adwuma.
His car was new, beautiful and expensive.	Ná ne kar no yɛ foforo, ɛyɛ fɛ na ne bo yɛ den.
For that to happen, everyone has to give.	Sɛ ɛno bɛba a, ɛsɛ sɛ obiara de ma.
See below for full details.	Hwɛ ase hɔ ma nsɛm no nyinaa.
He didn't know what he thought.	Ná onnim nea osusuw.
But maybe that was the point.	Nanso ebia na ɛno ne asɛm no.
It is only now that we can know.	Ɛyɛ mprempren nkutoo na yebetumi ahu.
The items speak for themselves.	Nneɛma no kasa ma wɔn ho.
Thank you very much.	Meda ase paa.
He gives it to me.	Ɔde ma me.
At least not for long.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɔnyɛ saa bere tenten.
It’s important.	Ɛho hia.
Why he wants this is not entirely clear.	Nea enti a ɔpɛ eyi no mu nna hɔ koraa.
I would have done the same.	Anka me nso mɛyɛ saa.
He had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
You do all the work.	Wo na woyɛ adwuma no nyinaa.
Three cars are parked outside.	Wɔde kar abiɛsa asi abɔnten.
That’s us.	Ɛno ne yɛn.
Maybe it’s not his fault.	Ebia ɛnyɛ ne mfomso.
Businesses do this.	Nnwuma ahorow yɛ eyi.
You can’t beat me.	Worentumi nnya me so nkonim.
It was the perfect size.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse a edi mũ.
The idea itself is old.	Adwene no ankasa yɛ dedaw.
He didn’t know anything.	Ná onnim hwee.
I don't have a head to work with.	Minni ti a mede bɛyɛ adwuma.
The back of the house.	Ofie no akyi.
Maybe something terrible will happen.	Ebia biribi a ɛyɛ hu bɛba.
And live through them again.	Na fa wɔn so tra ase bio.
But it’s not about this.	Nanso ɛnyɛ eyi ho asɛm.
None of us go to it today.	Yɛn mu biara nkɔ bi nnɛ.
He didn't have to bother her anymore.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔhaw no bio.
in the street.	wɔ abɔnten so.
The whole point is the kids.	Asɛm no nyinaa ne mmofra no.
His idea was impossible.	Ná n’adwene no ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Nothing else happens.	Biribi foforo biara mma.
Which I just disagree with on this point.	Nea me ne no nyɛ adwene wɔ asɛm yi ho ara kwa.
It wasn’t good stuff.	Ná ɛnyɛ nneɛma pa.
Fortunately, there is something you can do.	Nea eye ne sɛ, biribi wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
The problem remains.	Ɔhaw no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
I know him.	Minim no.
Your reputation is impeccable.	Wo din pa no yɛ nea mfomso biara nni ho.
I can hardly believe it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nnye nni.
I need to understand more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete ase kɛse.
Put your feet on the ground.	Fa wo nan to fam.
The story said cheerfully.	Asɛm no de anigye kae.
Look away, too.	Hwɛ kɔ, nso.
But nothing comes without a cost.	Nanso biribiara mma a ɛho ka biara nni ho.
These things are far from perfect.	Saa nneɛma yi nyɛ pɛ koraa.
Maybe, but not necessarily.	Ebia, nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia.
There is no time like the present.	Bere biara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ mprempren yi.
That’s just what you need to know.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no ara pɛ.
This is common.	Eyi abu so.
That is not life.	Ɛno nyɛ nkwa.
The dog hit the boy.	Ɔkraman no bɔɔ abarimaa no.
Get out of the driveway .	Fi kar kwan no so .
I have no problem with it at all.	Minni ɔhaw biara wɔ ho koraa.
And how many.	Na dodow ahe.
A powerful thing.	Ade a tumi wom.
And we are like them.	Na yɛyɛ sɛ wɔn.
Exactly the same thing.	Ade koro no ara ankasa.
When it’s wet, it’s soft.	Sɛ ɛyɛ nsu a, ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
At least verbally.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔde ano ka.
However, he did.	Nanso, ɔyɛɛ saa.
You're here, you might as well make the most of it.	Wowɔ ha, ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ wode bedi dwuma yiye.
You need to know something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu biribi.
However, that’s just my opinion.	Nanso, ɛno yɛ m’adwene ara kwa.
You can do it from home.	Wubetumi afi fie ayɛ.
You know when your bills come in each month.	Wunim bere a wo ka ahorow ba ɔsram biara.
This was truly a happy time for me.	Na eyi yɛ anigye bere ma me ampa.
Work was hard and busy, but not difficult.	Ná adwuma yɛ den na adagyew nnim, nanso na ɛnyɛ den.
Everything felt great.	Biribiara tee nka sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse.
Most find such work exciting.	Dodow no ara hu sɛ adwuma a ɛte saa yɛ anigye.
It is amazing that each of us survived.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ yɛn mu biara nyaa nkwa.
I don’t really like this.	M’ani nnye eyi ho ankasa.
The truth is that	Nokware no ne sɛ .
But they are both there.	Nanso wɔn baanu nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
This will make you happy.	Eyi bɛma w’ani agye.
The situation is included.	Tebea no ka ho.
It works every time.	Ɛyɛ adwuma bere biara.
Many things.	Nneɛma pii.
The road will be dangerous, but we have food and water.	Ɔkwan no bɛyɛ hu, nanso yɛwɔ aduan ne nsu.
They are plenty good enough.	Wɔyɛ pii a eye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
But the meeting just ended!	Nanso nhyiam no baa awiei ara kwa!
However, many people are surprised.	Nanso, nnipa pii ho dwiriw wɔn.
He is a wonderful person.	Ɔyɛ onipa a ne ho yɛ nwonwa.
He was a strong character.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ den.
It hardly mattered.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛho nhia.
What you need to include.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ wode ka ho.
That is more important than anything else.	Ɛno ho hia sen biribi foforo biara.
It must have been his.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ ne de.
That’s what you see.	Ɛno ne nea wuhu.
The man had one.	Ná ɔbarima no wɔ bi.
We use attributes for this.	Yɛde su ahorow di dwuma ma eyi.
Back in time again.	San kɔ bere mu bio.
In the end it was pretty easy.	Awiei koraa no na ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
I have to say that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ.
It’s so bad.	Ɛyɛ bɔne paa.
He had to tell her about it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka ho asɛm kyerɛ no.
He didn't know if he ever would, not at all.	Ná onnim sɛ ebia ɔbɛyɛ saa da bi, ɛnyɛ koraa.
Back to such a time.	San kɔ bere a ɛte saa mu.
They were both nice people.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
But it’s pretty much the same.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa ara.
And, finally, all things crazy.	Na, awiei koraa no, nneɛma nyinaa kraman.
No other people you know.	Nnipa foforo biara nni hɔ a wunim wɔn.
There is a danger involved.	Asiane bi wɔ mu.
She had liked him immediately.	Ná n’ani agye ne ho ntɛm ara.
It’s not the first time this has happened.	Ɛnyɛ bere a edi kan a eyi aba.
He told me he didn’t know.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ onnim.
I found this out the hard way.	Mihuu eyi wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ den so.
They spent the rest of the next month there.	Wɔde ɔsram a edi hɔ no fã a aka no traa hɔ.
But it’s not what I like.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea m’ani gye ho.
Your kids don’t use it.	Wo mma no mfa nni dwuma.
Practice in advance where possible.	Di kan yɛ adesua wɔ baabi a ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
He took a big risk.	Ɔde ne ho too asiane kɛse mu.
He is definitely a genius.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔyɛ obi a ne ho akokwaw.
The problem is, they’re new to me.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ, wɔyɛ foforo ma me.
I had been hit by his power.	Ná ne tumi no abɔ me.
This usually happens when it’s hot or humid outside.	Eyi taa ba bere a abɔnten yɛ hyew anaasɛ ɛyɛ hyew no.
He’s got you into it, like everyone else.	Ɔde wo akɔ mu, te sɛ obiara.
That is something they will appreciate.	Ɛno yɛ biribi a wɔn ani begye ho.
This is a real mistake.	Eyi yɛ mfomso ankasa.
I knew whatever he said would do.	Ná minim sɛ biribiara a ɔbɛka no bɛyɛ.
But it is not in the past.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea atwam.
I'm just a kid.	Meyɛ abofra bi kɛkɛ.
But he doesn’t.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa.
They are of good quality.	Wɔyɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ su pa.
It’s a beautiful quality.	Ɛyɛ su a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I would do the same to you.	Anka mɛyɛ wo saa ara.
It has to be perfect.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ pɛ.
One man, working it all out.	Ɔbarima biako, a ɔreyɛ ne nyinaa ho adwuma.
Watch the movie.	Hwɛ sini no.
There was no problem.	Ná ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
You are a test case.	Woyɛ sɔhwɛ asɛm.
Thank you for this moment.	Meda mo ase wɔ saa bere yi ho.
He always does that.	Ɔyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
This is just the first car that has been used on it.	Eyi yɛ kar a edi kan a wɔde adi dwuma wɔ so no ara kwa.
No one saw him now.	Obiara anhu no mprempren.
He was a boy.	Ná ɔyɛ abarimaa.
I don’t want to know anything.	Mempɛ sɛ mihu biribiara.
But there was no help for it.	Nanso na mmoa biara nni hɔ mma ho.
So it’s pretty cool.	Enti ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
This man gave me a job.	Saa ɔbarima yi maa me adwuma.
Get him back on the phone.	San fa no kɔ telefon so.
He has brought me there.	Ɔde me aba hɔ.
This was closer to me.	Ná eyi bɛn me kɛse.
That’s what you want too.	Ɛno ne nea wo nso wopɛ.
It wasn’t a good movie.	Ná ɛnyɛ sini pa.
Just be you.	Yɛ wo ara kwa.
Many others were not surprised.	Nnipa pii a aka ho no anyɛ wɔn nwonwa.
It was simple, so very simple.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw, enti na ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
In this case, the situation goes to the whole picture.	Wɔ eyi mu no, tebea no kɔ mfonini no nyinaa so.
I told him that I liked him.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ m’ani gye ne ho.
Which, by the way, he was.	Nea, ɔkwan bi so no, na ɔyɛ.
What do we have here?	Dɛn na yɛwɔ wɔ ha?
It performs two functions.	Ɛyɛ adwuma abien.
I'm planning it.	Meyɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
This goes back to the previous point.	Eyi san kɔ asɛm a atwam no so.
Quickly clear everything off the table.	Yɛ ntɛm yi biribiara a ɛwɔ pon no so no fi hɔ.
What is it that it is.	Dɛn na ɛyɛ.
The matter was dropped.	Wɔde asɛm no too hɔ.
So it must have been my fault.	Enti ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ me mfomso.
I had to touch him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede me nsa ka no.
He had a snake at home.	Ná ɔwɔ wɔ fie.
He had no time for a game.	Ná onni bere mma agoru bi.
Accept.	Gye to mu.
He, she, and the music was all that mattered.	Ɔno, ɔno, ne nnwom no nkutoo na na ɛho hia.
This seemed quite strange.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ nwonwa koraa.
You can take a good look at it.	Wubetumi ahwɛ no yiye.
I think most of us had an idea of ​​what was inside.	Misusuw sɛ na yɛn mu dodow no ara wɔ adwene bi wɔ nea ɛwɔ mu no ho.
It wasn’t pretty.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
The summer was very hot.	Ná awɔw bere no mu yɛ hyew yiye.
He hit the floor with the pleasure chamber inside him.	Ɔde anigye dan a ɛwɔ ne mu no bɔɔ fam.
That’s how long it takes to come up with a plan.	Ɛno ne bere tenten a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde nhyehyɛe bi ba.
The currency had plummeted in value.	Ná sika no bo akɔ fam kɛse.
He's just kind of.	Ɔyɛ ɔkwan bi so ara kwa.
I really liked that he was happy.	M’ani gyee ho ankasa sɛ n’ani gye.
A picture was placed on his desk.	Wɔde mfonini bi too ne pon so.
If the object is genuine, nothing else should matter.	Sɛ ade no yɛ nokware a, ɛnsɛ sɛ biribi foforo biara ho hia.
That’s when I knew.	Saa bere no na minim.
Part of it.	Ne fã bi.
Maybe it was both.	Ebia na ɛyɛ abien no nyinaa.
Remove and repeat.	Yi fi mu na san yɛ bio.
There are many opinions out there.	Adwene ahorow pii wɔ hɔ a ɛwɔ hɔ.
No one said the big time was easy.	Obiara anka sɛ bere kɛse no yɛ mmerɛw.
And it’s even better.	Na ɛyɛ yiye mpo.
However, this approach is not optimal.	Nanso, saa kwan yi nyɛ nea eye sen biara.
They should be able to take care of them themselves.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn ankasa tumi hwɛ wɔn.
Some things have to give, but not everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma bi ma, nanso ɛnyɛ biribiara.
They were just real people.	Ná wɔyɛ nnipa ankasa ara kwa.
He has given you someone else's fur.	Ɔde obi foforo aboa nhoma ama wo.
He took most of the tests.	Ɔyɛɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow no mu dodow no ara.
We both seem to be wrong.	Ɛte sɛ nea yɛn baanu nyinaa di mfomso.
I know he has one.	Minim sɛ ɔwɔ bi.
Kids love that movie.	Mmofra ani gye saa sini no ho.
I don’t have that much time.	Minni bere pii saa.
I know there are many.	Minim sɛ pii wɔ hɔ.
I’m not sure what to do.	M’ani agye me ho.
Guide.	Kyerɛ kwan.
Look at my father.	Hwɛ me papa.
I couldn’t see the way.	Na mintumi nhu ɔkwan no.
This car has seen better days.	Saa kar yi ahu nna a eye sen saa.
He will take the exam next month.	Ɔbɛyɛ sɔhwɛ no ɔsram a edi hɔ no.
You need to do this carefully.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi yiye.
It all sounded interesting.	Ná ne nyinaa te sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
He is not very big.	Ɔnyɛ kɛse koraa.
That’s what we do a lot of that we shouldn’t do.	Ɛno na yɛyɛ pii a ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
That night, however, something very beautiful happened.	Nanso, saa anadwo no, biribi a ɛyɛ fɛ paa sii.
Close your eyes and think about your child.	Ka w’ani na susuw wo ba no ho.
I think he was real too.	Misusuw sɛ na ɔno nso yɛ obi ankasa.
Please say that again.	Mesrɛ wo, ka saa bio.
He told her that he had to.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Do you have the time?	So wowɔ bere no?
That was the way it was for me.	Saa na na ɛte ma me.
That work should be done tomorrow.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa adwuma no ɔkyena.
The vehicle to be driven.	Kar a wɔde bɛka.
Tell me this is not true.	Ka kyerɛ me sɛ eyi nyɛ nokware.
I thought that was awesome.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno yɛ hu.
We had them there yesterday.	Yɛwɔ wɔn wɔ hɔ nnɛra.
He was too weak.	Ná wayɛ mmerɛw dodo.
He wasn't alone this time.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na saa bere yi de.
Again this was not very successful.	Bio nso eyi antumi anyɛ yiye kɛse.
Things will be hot.	Nneɛma bɛyɛ hyew.
This should not continue.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi kɔ so.
We take us back.	Yɛde yɛn san kɔ.
Do you have any more information?.	So wowɔ ho nsɛm foforo bi?.
But you are not too beautiful today.	Nanso wo ho nyɛ fɛ dodo nnɛ.
I don't care what they talk about.	Nea wɔka ho asɛm no mfa me ho.
Maybe it never really existed.	Ebia na ɛnyɛ hɔ ankasa da.
But it wasn’t, it wasn’t, it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛnte saa, ɛnte saa, na ɛnte saa.
It’s a wonderful group of people.	Ɛyɛ nnipa kuw a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
And you know it when you see it.	Na wunim bere a wuhu no.
We might have more fun down there.	Ebia yɛn ani begye kɛse wɔ fam hɔ.
I would love to do that though.	Anka m’ani begye ho sɛ mɛyɛ saa de.
He stared at her intently.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no ​​denneennen.
He had no idea how much time had passed.	Ná onni bere dodow a atwam no ho adwene biara.
I want his son.	Mepɛ ne ba.
They all believed in the life of the mind.	Wɔn nyinaa gye dii sɛ adwene mu nkwa no te.
You are the reason why.	Woyɛ nea enti a ɛte saa.
No one else came to the party.	Obi foforo biara amma apontow no ase.
It was in almost all cases.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛwɔ nsɛm no nyinaa mu.
He wasn’t that kind of person.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a ɔte saa.
It was a total disaster.	Ná ɛyɛ asiane koraa.
Clearly, it is not.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
He is obviously a happy dog.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔyɛ ɔkraman a ɔwɔ anigye.
There are really two issues in this case.	Nsɛm abien na ɛwɔ asɛm yi mu ankasa.
We can’t do that.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
I will be equal to you.	Me ne wo bɛyɛ pɛ.
It’s my house.	Ɛyɛ me fie.
I hear about him though.	Mete ne ho asɛm nanso.
And its taking everything in me to save this.	Na ne fa biribiara a ɛwɔ me mu de gye eyi.
I thought she was a good mom.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔyɛ maame pa.
Such were the terms used.	Saa na na nsɛm a wɔde di dwuma no te.
He was one of us.	Ná ɔyɛ yɛn mu biako.
The clothes were gorgeous.	Ná ntade no yɛ fɛ yiye.
He was certainly a beast.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔyɛ aboa.
But this is not the case.	Nanso eyi nyɛ saa.
I know a lot about you.	Minim nneɛma pii fa wo ho.
But he was no longer there.	Nanso na onni hɔ bio.
But not that night.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa anadwo no.
Everything he has done has worked.	Biribiara a wayɛ no ayɛ adwuma.
I would have done that.	Anka mɛyɛ saa.
Everything is wrong.	Ade nyinaa yɛ bɔne.
That was a huge mistake.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfomso kɛse.
None of the kids worked.	Mmofra no mu biara anyɛ adwuma.
There was no room for anyone else.	Ná baabi nni hɔ mma obi foforo.
The underlying concept is quite simple.	Adwene a ɛwɔ ase no yɛ mmerɛw koraa.
He touched the window, and glanced out.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa mfɛnsere no, na ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ mu.
I was both of them.	Ná meyɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa.
Mobile phones are common today.	Telefon a wɔde di dwuma wɔ nsa so abu so nnɛ.
It was his first film, just like you.	Ná ɛyɛ ne sini a edi kan, te sɛ wo ara.
The kids had a good night’s sleep.	Mmofra no nyaa nna pa anadwo.
That’s a little much.	Ɛno yɛ pii kakra.
The music continued.	Nnwom no kɔɔ so.
This should go faster this time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi kɔ ntɛmntɛm saa bere yi.
That must be difficult.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ den.
But most people are like me.	Nanso nnipa dodow no ara te sɛ me.
I did a lot of things.	Meyɛɛ nneɛma pii.
I can’t say what it is.	Mintumi nka nea ɛyɛ.
I say this here and now.	Meka eyi wɔ ha ne mprempren.
That’s not the issue here.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no wɔ ha.
I might even be doing that now.	Ebia na mereyɛ saa mpo mprempren.
This is what you said.	Eyi na wokae.
Wearing it to everyone you can find.	Ahyɛ obiara a wubetumi ahu no.
I was big for my age.	Ná meyɛ kɛse ma me mfe.
It’s still the best team no one has ever heard of.	Ɛda so ara yɛ kuw a eye sen biara a obiara nte ho asɛm pɛn.
I find it easy to use.	Mihu sɛ ɛnyɛ den sɛ mede bedi dwuma.
Each of them has a length.	Wɔn mu biara wɔ ne tenten.
That’s the case with me.	Ɛte saa wɔ me fam.
No one went to him.	Obiara ankɔ ne nkyɛn.
I want this done though.	Mepɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi de.
But this is us.	Nanso eyi ne yɛn.
Those days are long gone.	Saa nna no atwam akyɛ.
That’s the real thing.	Ɛno ne no ankasa.
This is his bed.	Eyi ne ne mpa.
I wish he worked for me.	Me yam a anka ɔyɛ adwuma maa me.
It was a little less good.	Na ɛnyɛ papa kakra.
There are two types here.	Ahorow abien na ɛwɔ ha.
If so, that would likely be the evil.	Sɛ ɛte saa a, ɛda adi sɛ ɛno na ɛbɛyɛ bɔne no.
The house comes fully furnished.	Ofie no ba a wɔde nneɛma a ɛho hia nyinaa ahyɛ mu ma.
It’s like a movie.	Ɛte sɛ sini.
It’s commonplace.	Ɛyɛ nea abu so.
In this context, both mean the same thing.	Wɔ saa asɛm yi mu no, abien no nyinaa kyerɛ ade koro.
Almost no game.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ agoru biara nni hɔ.
If you are in that case.	Sɛ wowɔ saa asɛm no mu a.
It was his money.	Ná ɛyɛ ne sika.
Surprisingly, so was the car.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa no, na kar no nso te saa ara.
I know that’s something.	Minim sɛ ɛno yɛ biribi.
That too was very successful and popular.	Ɛno nso dii yiye kɛse na nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
That’s why it’s so.	Ɛno nti na ɛte saa.
I think we had that.	Misusuw sɛ na yɛwɔ saa.
This part of the city was prosperous.	Ná kurow no fã yi di yiye.
One of them was a human.	Ná wɔn mu biako yɛ onipa.
Most of them were quick to sign.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara yɛɛ ntɛm de wɔn nsa hyɛɛ ase.
Tell the story.	Ka asɛm no.
You must want to do it for hours and hours.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ no nnɔnhwerew ne nnɔnhwerew pii.
Immediately the children are with him.	Ntɛm ara na mmofra no wɔ ne nkyɛn.
I don’t want to give the story away.	Mempɛ sɛ mede asɛm no bɛma.
That is the time of day when the animals sleep.	Ɛno ne da no mu bere a mmoa no da.
We just don’t.	Yɛn kɛkɛ.
But there was no time.	Nanso na bere nni hɔ.
Except for the girl.	Gye sɛ abeawa no nkutoo.
The end of the road.	Ɔkwan no awiei.
It’s not a power walk.	Ɛnyɛ tumi nantew.
No word as of this morning.	Asɛm biara nni hɔ de besi anɔpa yi.
The time was short.	Ná bere no yɛ tiaa.
I think it was really true.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ nokware ankasa.
The story had many beauties.	Ná asɛm no wɔ nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ fɛ.
But it is no longer his home.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ne fie bio.
But it’s a difficult one.	Nanso ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
If you can find that picture, we would be happy.	Sɛ wubetumi anya saa mfonini no a, yɛn ani begye.
I get it, you believe it’s too late.	Me nsa ka, wo gye di sɛ ɛyɛ akyiri dodo.
Everything is in us.	Biribiara wɔ yɛn mu.
This is only half the picture.	Eyi yɛ mfonini no fã pɛ.
Most of these systems were crude and inefficient.	Ná nhyehyɛe ahorow yi mu dodow no ara yɛ nea ɛnyɛ den na ɛnyɛ adwuma yiye.
I think they are wonderful.	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ nwonwa.
That was obvious.	Ná ɛno mu da hɔ.
I don't think he will though.	Minsusuw sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa de.
Most users will use one language or another.	Wɔn a wɔde di dwuma no mu dodow no ara de kasa biako anaa foforo bedi dwuma.
You’re interested in them.	W’ani gye wɔn ho.
And that meant everyone.	Na na ɛno kyerɛ obiara.
It’s not the truth.	Ɛnyɛ nokware no.
He wanted it to be that way.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
No one knows how many.	Obiara nnim dodow ahe.
Nor is it the end of the story.	Saa ara nso na ɛnyɛ asɛm no awiei.
I shouldn’t have told my wife anything.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meka biribiara kyerɛ me yere.
This seems quite strange.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ nwonwa koraa.
Just forget about that.	Wo werɛ mfi saa asɛm no ara kwa.
I never want children.	Mempɛ mma da.
Something had gone wrong.	Ná biribi anyɛ yiye.
Every night at night, my plan became clearer.	Anadwo biara anadwo no, na me nhyehyɛe no mu da hɔ kɛse.
You need to take the test now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ sɔhwɛ no mprempren.
I talk to him every week.	Me ne no kasa dapɛn biara.
This is your city, your people.	Eyi ne wo kurow, wo nkurɔfo.
But it’s obviously much more complicated than that.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den sen saa koraa.
This is my opinion.	Eyi ne m’adwene.
He drove me here.	Ɔde me kar baa ha.
Two of them actually.	Wɔn mu abien ankasa.
say such terrible things!	nka nsɛm a ɛyɛ hu a ɛte saa!
It was as simple as that.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ nea ɛte saa.
I’d appreciate that.	M’ani begye saa asɛm no ho.
I can’t do that.	Mintumi nyɛ saa.
Look at the characters.	Hwɛ nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no.
But that’s just my opinion.	Nanso ɛno yɛ m’adwene ara kwa.
Or maybe it’s not their fault.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛnyɛ wɔn mfomso.
But no one wanted to go.	Nanso na obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔbɛkɔ.
He had no power.	Ná onni tumi biara.
But that’s not the intent.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne adwene a ɛwɔ akyi.
If there was a house, it would be here.	Sɛ ofie bi wɔ hɔ a, anka ɛwɔ ha.
It was not to be this time.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa bere yi.
I thought he liked being able to control it.	Misusuwii sɛ n’ani gye ho sɛ obetumi adi so.
But that was in the game plan.	Nanso na ɛno wɔ agoru no ho nhyehyɛe mu.
There are so many things he could have said.	Nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ a anka obetumi aka.
They are both good people.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ nnipa pa.
We can make an effort.	Yebetumi abɔ mmɔden.
It’s just an idea that our minds have created.	Ɛyɛ adwene bi a yɛn adwene abɔ ara kwa.
I can’t see him.	Mintumi nhu no.
Never tell anyone anything you weren’t supposed to do.	Nka biribiara a na ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ nkyerɛ obiara da.
I don’t think that’s the case.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛte saa.
I have everything here.	Mewɔ biribiara wɔ ha.
This works most of the time.	Eyi yɛ adwuma bere dodow no ara.
I couldn’t do that anyway.	Na mintumi nyɛ saa ɔkwan biara so.
I have a lot to tell you.	Mewɔ nsɛm pii a mɛka akyerɛ wo.
Or maybe it was his.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɛyɛ ne de.
Everyone says they are really fun.	Obiara ka sɛ wɔyɛ anigye ankasa.
Are you sure this package is safe?	So wugye di sɛ saa ade a wɔde ahyɛ mu yi yɛ nea asiane biara nni ho?
However, this was later.	Nanso, na eyi yɛ akyiri yi.
But no one came for them.	Nanso obiara amma amma wɔn.
That means their feet may also be affected.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ ebia wɔn nan nso bɛka wɔn.
It feels too soon.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo.
And if you want to do that.	Na sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ saa a.
I’m a little bit nervous.	M’ani nnye ho kakra.
You are doing too much.	Woreyɛ ayɛ pii dodo.
It should be possible.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yiye.
Once again, track your funding.	Saa bere yi nso, di sika a wode ma no akyi.
We hope he makes a full recovery.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ ne ho bɛtɔ no koraa.
I don’t know him as well as I do.	Minnim no yiye sɛ me.
He is a fascinating character.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ anigye.
Know where he was.	Hu baabi a na ɔwɔ.
You don’t want to know the whole story.	Wompɛ sɛ wuhu asɛm no nyinaa.
That was a great man.	Ná ɛno yɛ onipa kɛse.
It either works or it doesn’t.	Ɛyɛ adwuma anaasɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I know this, but it wasn’t really why.	Minim eyi, nanso na ɛnyɛ nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa.
It just has to be one thing.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ade biako kɛkɛ.
And it was only part of it.	Na na ne fã bi pɛ.
Maybe, never.	Ebia, ɛnyɛ da.
This failed to happen.	Eyi antumi anyɛ.
Until he.	Kosi sɛ ɔno.
I don't have time.	Minni bere.
I love it there.	M’ani gye ho wɔ hɔ.
I may not even be a real person.	Ebia menyɛ onipa ankasa mpo.
She wants a new dress.	Ɔpɛ atade foforo.
But if he could, he would.	Nanso sɛ obetumi a, anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Everyone there thought it was a good idea.	Obiara a ɔwɔ hɔ no susuwii sɛ ɛyɛ adwene pa.
It’s not that exciting.	Ɛnyɛ anigye saa.
I hope you enjoy the book.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye nhoma no ho.
But it’s not like that anymore.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa bio.
It shouldn’t be the case.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
A man spoke to me.	Ɔbarima bi kasa kyerɛɛ me.
He could cook with anything and eat nothing.	Ná obetumi de biribiara ayɛ aduan na onni hwee.
It was very intelligent of him.	Ná ɛyɛ nyansa kɛse wɔ ne ho.
That’s how you think about things.	Saa na wususuw nneɛma ho.
It’s what you want.	Ɛyɛ nea wopɛ.
This is another issue we had.	Eyi yɛ asɛm foforo a na yɛwɔ.
It was a school group.	Ná ɛyɛ sukuu kuw bi.
It would be a very big problem.	Ɛbɛyɛ ɔhaw kɛse paa.
Look at him.	Hwɛ no.
But we do without a doubt.	Nanso yɛyɛ saa a akyinnye biara nni ho.
Any help would be great.	Mmoa biara bɛyɛ kɛse.
But there is still hope.	Nanso anidaso da so ara wɔ hɔ.
It’s still something we do to this very day.	Ɛda so ara yɛ biribi a yɛyɛ de besi nnɛ ara.
A large part of the old town still remains.	Kurow dedaw no fã kɛse bi da so ara wɔ hɔ.
He was amazing.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa.
They are very beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
A man is a two-legged thing.	Ɔbarima yɛ ade a ne nan abien.
It was easily the best project we’ve been given so far.	Na ɛnyɛ den sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a eye sen biara a wɔde ama yɛn de besi saa bere yi.
I’m happy with my way.	M’ani gye me kwan so.
Put it all in it.	Fa ne nyinaa hyɛ mu.
Nothing we do here is ever perfect.	Biribiara nni hɔ a yɛyɛ wɔ ha a ɛyɛ pɛ da.
We have to do what matters.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nea ɛho hia.
I love the movie, and so do my kids.	M’ani gye sini no ho, na saa ara na me mma nso ani gye ho.
I think your last point is most important.	Misusuw sɛ wo nsɛm a etwa to no ho hia sen biara.
Even after all this time.	Bere yi nyinaa akyi mpo.
But it’s never, ever true.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nokware da, da.
That played deeper.	Ɛno bɔɔ mu kɔɔ akyiri.
We do things that only we can do.	Yɛyɛ nneɛma a yɛn nkutoo na yebetumi ayɛ.
I'm watching it closely.	Mehwɛ no yiye.
It was really true.	Ná ɛyɛ nokware ankasa.
Where water ran.	Baabi a na nsu tu mmirika.
Whoever it was must follow everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara a na ɔyɛ no di biribiara akyi.
This works well.	Eyi yɛ adwuma yiye.
The words themselves will come.	Nsɛm no ankasa bɛba.
I saw the snake.	Mihuu ɔwɔ no.
Maybe there is nothing.	Ebia biribiara nni hɔ.
I expect you knew that too.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ na wo nso wunim saa.
I’m happy to be doing this job.	M’ani agye sɛ mereyɛ adwuma yi.
I saw a man sitting on the floor.	Mihuu ɔbarima bi sɛ ɔte fam hɔ.
The end game.	Awiei agoru no.
Truth has nothing to do with it.	Nokware ne no nni hwee yɛ.
Forget the headache.	Wo werɛ mfi ti a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no.
This was not something he talked about.	Ná eyi nyɛ biribi a ɔka ho asɛm.
He pretended to be an old man.	Ɔyɛɛ ne ho sɛ ɔbarima a ne mfe akɔ anim.
He touched the handle.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa nsa no.
Tell me another one, do it.	Ka foforo kyerɛ me, yɛ.
This case is not well before us.	Saa asɛm yi nni yɛn anim yiye.
Take it and have fun.	Fa no na momma mo ani nnye.
I knew exactly what had happened, and yet.	Ná minim nea asi no yiye, na nanso.
It is quite common.	Ɛyɛ ade a nkurɔfo taa hu no koraa.
Do the latter, before the former.	Yɛ nea etwa to no, ansa na woayɛ kan no.
But if you don’t want to, you don’t have to.	Nanso sɛ wompɛ a, ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I'm so happy for you both.	M'ani agye yiye ma mo baanu nyinaa.
So that’s all about it.	Enti ɛno nyinaa fa ho.
And that stayed that way for a while.	Na ɛno kɔɔ so traa saa bere tiaa bi.
And maybe not well at that.	Na ebia ɛnyɛ yiye wɔ saa mu.
And this is what you see.	Na eyi na wuhu.
But for now, though.	Nanso mprempren de.
This car does not exist.	Saa kar yi nni hɔ.
No one saw him.	Obiara anhu no.
And, the house.	Na, ofie no.
That’s how great it is.	Saa na ɛyɛ kɛse.
I really want it.	Mepɛ no ampa.
The past week had been difficult.	Ná dapɛn a atwam no ayɛ den.
I wanted a story.	Ná mepɛ asɛm bi.
He was everything my mother wanted.	Ná ɔyɛ biribiara a me maame pɛ.
His speech was touching.	Ná ne kasa no ka nnipa.
There is a situation.	Tebea bi wɔ hɔ.
It was obviously not.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛnte saa.
But it doesn’t work.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma.
He obviously wasn’t doing a very good job.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔnyɛ adwuma pa koraa.
I think it might be something else.	Misusuw sɛ ebia ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
A really good movie.	Sini pa ankasa.
All of this costs a lot of money.	Eyi nyinaa gye sika pii.
Is this the right way?	So eyi ne ɔkwan pa?
The real must end for the new to be.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ankasa no ba awiei na ama foforo no ayɛ.
There really is something for everyone.	Biribi wɔ hɔ ma obiara ankasa.
I can’t take him home.	Mintumi mfa no nkɔ fie.
Just not the whole test.	Ɛnyɛ sɔhwɛ no nyinaa kɛkɛ.
I know where he lived.	Minim baabi a na ɔte.
No food, no water.	Aduan biara nni hɔ, nsu biara nni hɔ.
He’s just a great guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse bi kɛkɛ.
What was he going to do with it?.	Dɛn na na ɔde bɛyɛ?.
That made me feel great, really good.	Ɛno maa metee nka kɛse, yiye ankasa.
I keep putting it off.	Mekɔ so de to nkyɛn.
Apparently for the sake of beauty.	Ɛda adi sɛ sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛbɛyɛ fɛ.
This is not really true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware ankasa.
Clearly, he had great power.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔwɔ tumi kɛse.
I know it’s hard.	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ den.
The girl doesn’t know how she feels.	Abeawa no nnim sɛnea ɔte nka.
But it doesn’t have to be.	Nanso ɛho nhia sɛ ɛte saa.
This is why planning is important.	Eyi nti na nhyehyɛe ho hia no.
Which is good, but not amazing.	Nea eye, nanso ɛnyɛ nwonwa.
He was doing that.	Ná ɔyɛ saa.
We drove to a party.	Yɛde kar kɔɔ apontow bi ase.
Here is the man.	Ɔbarima no ni.
It was midnight.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo fã.
Do you want to say that he made you.	So wopɛ sɛ woka sɛ ɔno na ɔyɛɛ wo.
That had finally come to an end.	Ná ɛno aba awiei koraa.
We have also given our opinion in the paper.	Yɛde yɛn adwene nso ama wɔ krataa no mu.
No one can do that.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ saa.
However, something had to be done,	Nanso, na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi, .
Moreover, it should not have played any part in it.	Bio nso, anka ɛnsɛ sɛ edi dwuma biara wɔ mu.
He pretended to be ignorant.	Ɔyɛɛ ne ho sɛ onnim hwee.
At the same time, there were problems at home.	Bere koro no ara mu no na ɔhaw ahorow wɔ fie.
Studies can’t go on like that.	Adesua ahorow ntumi nkɔ so saa.
He just wasn't, either.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa ara, nso.
Maybe he'll join.	Ebia ɔbɛka ho.
According to its size.	Sɛnea ne kɛse te.
The path is clear.	Ɔkwan no mu da hɔ.
He has a little life left in him.	Nkwa kakra aka wɔ ne mu.
But it’s only one of them that you like.	Nanso ɛyɛ wɔn mu biako pɛ a w’ani gye ho.
He nodded at me.	Ɔde ne ti too fam kyerɛɛ me.
That’s an important thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade a ɛho hia.
You told us.	Woka kyerɛɛ yɛn.
Don't reach in or anything.	Mfa wo nsa nkɔ mu anaa biribiara.
But he didn’t really know her.	Nanso na onnim no ankasa.
It seemed so good.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eye saa.
There was no other person present, just.	Na onipa foforo biara nni hɔ a ɔwɔ hɔ, kɛkɛ.
He adds that.	Ɔka bio sɛ.
He wanted her.	Ná ɔpɛ no.
We had the.	Ná yɛwɔ.
In other words, the test.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, sɔhwɛ no.
There were older people.	Ná nnipa a wɔn mfe akɔ anim wɔ hɔ.
There was no hope and only one thing to do.	Na anidaso biara nni hɔ na na ade biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Our kids are good kids.	Yɛn mma yɛ mmofra pa.
He had to have his meeting.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ne nhyiam no.
His wife's house.	Ne yere fie.
Anything can be true.	Biribiara betumi ayɛ nokware.
But that’s it.	Nanso ɛno ne no.
A state of mind.	Adwene tebea bi.
I’ve admired the photos for years.	M’ani agye mfonini ahorow no ho mfe pii ni.
They just can’t leave well enough alone.	Wɔn nkutoo ntumi mfi hɔ yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ kɛkɛ.
So he has a place.	Enti ɔwɔ baabi.
It’s beautiful outside as well as inside.	Ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ abɔnten ne mu nso.
It seems that after a long time.	Ɛte sɛ nea bere tenten bi akyi.
People look into it, look at the past.	Nkurɔfo hwɛ mu, hwɛ nea atwam.
This is my room.	Eyi ne me dan.
Sleep with him tonight.	Wo ne no nna anadwo yi.
It was like a house.	Ná ɛte sɛ ofie bi.
That’s how amazing he looked.	Saa na na ne ho yɛ nwonwa.
This might just save your life one day.	Ebia eyi begye wo nkwa ara kwa da bi.
He says, go away.	Ɔka sɛ, kɔ.
He wanted to do more work.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma pii.
But there is no one.	Nanso obiara nni hɔ.
To the best of my knowledge.	Sɛnea minim no yiye no.
Maybe next time you can schedule me better.	Ebia bere foforo a wubetumi ayɛ me ho nhyehyɛe yiye.
Again, none of this information matters.	Bio nso, nsɛm yi mu biara ho nhia.
This room has very few windows.	Saa dan yi wɔ mfɛnsere kakraa bi pɛ.
That’s a strategy that never works well.	Ɛno yɛ ɔkwan a ɛnyɛ adwuma yiye da.
But it doesn’t seem to work.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ adwuma.
They were just kids.	Ná wɔyɛ mmofra ara kwa.
It’s not as hard as it sounds.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛnea ɛte no.
I forget his name.	Me werɛ afi ne din.
That’s what everyone is perfect for.	Ɛno na obiara yɛ pɛ.
So, no one owns them.	Enti, obiara nni hɔ a ɔwɔ wɔn.
There are a lot of kids on the floor.	Mmofra pii wɔ fam hɔ.
I took him there.	Mede no kɔɔ hɔ.
I hope you do, too.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wobɛyɛ, nso.
He nodded, but he already knew.	Ɔde ne ti too fam, nanso na onim dedaw.
Not that he liked the job.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ n’ani gyee adwuma no ho.
And I'm not the same.	Na me nso me.
This is a great thing.	Eyi yɛ ade kɛse.
Maybe that’s what that story is about.	Ebia ɛno ne nea saa asɛm no fa ho.
My son is strong.	Me ba no ho yɛ den.
He is a newcomer.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ foforo.
Until it’s just one man with all her attention.	Kosi sɛ ɛbɛyɛ ɔbarima biako pɛ a ɔwɔ n’adwene nyinaa.
However, many of my friends do.	Nanso, me nnamfo pii yɛ saa.
And its absolutely crazy.	Na ne kraman koraa.
Make the language very beautiful.	Ma kasa no nyɛ fɛ yiye.
The general problem is one of policy.	Ɔhaw a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa ne nhyehyɛe ho.
It’s your hands.	Ɛyɛ wo nsa.
Go back to my room.	San kɔ me dan mu.
There is hope, though.	Nanso, anidaso wɔ hɔ.
Look at the picture.	Hwɛ mfonini no.
It is the first time that has been presented.	Ɛyɛ bere a edi kan a wɔde saa asɛm no akyerɛ.
But it’s not enough.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
Now we are in a different situation.	Seesei yɛwɔ tebea foforo mu.
But something is going on with this guy there.	Nanso biribi rekɔ so wɔ saa ɔbarima yi ho wɔ hɔ.
You don’t know it’s much worse than you think.	Wunnim sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne koraa sen sɛnea wususuw.
But much better than that.	Nanso eye sen saa koraa.
Everything is going in the right direction.	Biribiara rekɔ ɔkwan pa so.
Exactly the same way.	Ɔkwan koro no ara so koraa.
He showed us his new car.	Ɔde ne kar foforo no kyerɛɛ yɛn.
Put me in the mud.	To me mu.
And this is your city.	Na eyi ne wo kurow.
In all difficult situations.	Wɔ tebea a ɛyɛ den nyinaa mu.
No one leads with that.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔde saa asɛm no di anim.
And so it was with this one.	Na saa ara na na ɛte wɔ eyi ho.
I can't tell if this is the case.	Mintumi nhu sɛ eyi te saa anaa.
They are quick, easy and a lot of fun too.	Wɔyɛ ntɛm, ɛnyɛ den na ɛyɛ anigye pii nso.
I can’t do that.	Mintumi nyɛ saa.
Just like a real system.	Te sɛ nhyehyɛe ankasa bi ara pɛ.
It was his .	Ná ɛyɛ ne de .
We have another problem.	Yɛwɔ ɔhaw foforo bi.
It’s not our plan.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn nhyehyɛe no.
I am a window.	Meyɛ mfɛnsere.
I speak the language.	Meka kasa no.
And he wanted to be with her.	Na na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka ne ho.
That issue is not before us.	Saa asɛm no nni yɛn anim.
A dog has no chance.	Ɔkraman nni hokwan biara.
We do, of course.	Yɛyɛ, ampa.
Or you’re jealous.	Anaasɛ w’ani bere.
I'm on it again.	Mewɔ so bio.
It is still on display.	Ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ a wɔde kyerɛ.
Words of enthusiasm.	Nsɛm a wɔde anigye gye ka.
I love you too much.	Mepɛ wo dodo.
His day did get better, though.	Nanso, ne da no yɛɛ yiye ampa.
My mother does that.	Me maame yɛ saa.
However, the problem goes deeper than that.	Nanso, ɔhaw no kɔ akyiri sen saa.
Winter is when the days are shortest.	Awɔw bere ne bere a nna no yɛ tiaa sen biara.
He didn't know much.	Ná onnim nneɛma pii.
Tell me about your mother.	Ka wo maame ho asɛm kyerɛ me.
Better not have to, better not have to.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ, eye sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
It had to be here somewhere.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ ha wɔ baabi.
I have a good job, so there’s that.	Mewɔ adwuma pa, enti ɛno wɔ hɔ.
It was a very good game.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a eye paa.
This is bigger than me.	Eyi yɛ kɛse sen me.
They are hard but good for the kids.	Wɔyɛ den nanso wɔyɛ papa ma mmofra no.
The animals can also sense things.	Mmoa no nso tumi te nneɛma nka.
No one is home except me.	Obiara nni fie gye me.
You’ve been so strong.	Woayɛ den kɛse.
Everyone knows everything.	Obiara nim biribiara.
People are also interested in it.	Nkurɔfo nso ani gye ho.
But two things.	Nanso nneɛma abien bi.
It hurts for them too.	Ɛyɛ yaw ma wɔn nso.
Put it down.	Fa to fam.
No shots yet, but that could just be a while.	Tuo biara nni hɔ de besi nnɛ, nanso ɛno betumi ayɛ bere tiaa bi kɛkɛ.
The first is the person.	Nea odi kan ne onipa.
All things in a way.	Nneɛma nyinaa wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
They just do their job and do it well.	Wɔyɛ wɔn adwuma ara kwa na wɔyɛ no yiye.
I couldn’t see anything out of the window.	Ná mintumi nhu biribiara mfi mfɛnsere no mu.
I shouldn’t have been surprised.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ me nwonwa.
He wasn't that hot stuff.	Ná ɔnyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ hyew saa.
I can’t do much anymore.	Mintumi nyɛ pii bio.
A few hours later, the incident was forgotten.	Nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi akyi no, na wɔn werɛ afi asɛm a esii no.
These features are perfect for the job.	Saa nneɛma yi yɛ nea edi mũ ma adwuma no.
You never hurt.	Wonyɛ yaw da.
Clearly, something was wrong with him.	Ɛda adi sɛ na biribi anyɛ yiye wɔ ne ho.
I wanted to see what you were doing.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ nea woreyɛ no.
It’s a terrible job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ hu.
I hope you enjoy your stay there.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye wo tra wɔ hɔ ho.
There is no picture book.	Mfonini nhoma biara nni hɔ.
You don’t know what he looks like.	Wunnim sɛnea ɔte.
But otherwise, he was perfect too.	Nanso sɛ ɛnte saa a, na ɔno nso yɛ pɛ.
There is only so much we can do to help them.	Nneɛma pii nkutoo na yebetumi ayɛ de aboa wɔn.
I just felt terrible.	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ hu ara kwa.
That was something else.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade foforo.
Everyone has the right to do so.	Obiara wɔ ho kwan sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
And it was just awesome.	Na na ɛyɛ hu ara kwa.
He certainly had an eye for the big picture.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na n’ani wɔ mfonini kɛse no ho.
Maybe this is in his nature.	Ebia eyi wɔ ne su mu.
There were very few.	Ná kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
They all work well together.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye.
There are no certainties.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ nokware biara nni hɔ.
A lot of things the team needed to hear.	Nneɛma pii a na ɛsɛ sɛ kuw no te.
What would that have been.	Dɛn na anka ɛno bɛyɛ.
And it was a great one.	Na ɛyɛ kɛse.
It’s the first long walk of its kind.	Ɛyɛ nantew tenten a edi kan a ɛte saa.
This article is for informational purposes only.	Saa asɛm yi yɛ nsɛm a wɔde bedi dwuma nkutoo.
They must be free.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn ho.
He slammed his hat on her.	Ɔde ne kyɛw no bɔɔ no.
That’s okay, the man said.	Ɛno nyɛ hwee, ɔbarima no kae.
At the last moment.	Wɔ bere a etwa to no mu.
That’s why it matters to him.	Ɛno nti na ɛho hia no.
No one really should have been surprised.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara ho dwiriw no ankasa.
One should not let out too much information.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obi ma nsɛm pii fi adi.
Or so it seems.	Anaasɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛte.
It was too late, anyway.	Ná aka akyi dodo, sɛnea ɛte biara.
This came as a bit of a surprise to many.	Eyi yɛɛ nnipa pii nwonwa kakra.
That must be the name of an animal!	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛno ne aboa bi din!
Prices have fallen dramatically.	Nneɛma bo akɔ fam kɛse.
It was a happy time.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye bere.
You can’t do this anymore.	Worentumi nyɛ eyi bio.
I felt like a child.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ abofra.
I have nothing to do with a book.	Me ne nhoma bi nni hwee yɛ.
And if you were out there, you would be one of those things.	Na sɛ wowɔ abɔnten a, anka wobɛyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biako.
The summer was blistering.	Ná awɔw bere no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hyew.
Everyone as they please.	Obiara sɛnea ɔpɛ.
This is my song.	Eyi ne me dwom.
It’s a big deal now.	Ɛyɛ ade kɛse bi mprempren.
The man immediately disputed the money.	Ntɛm ara na ɔbarima no gyee sika no ho akyinnye.
Even if it’s me.	Sɛ ɛyɛ me mpo a.
I think that’s pretty amazing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa yiye.
I didn’t even know what to say.	Ná minnim nea mɛka mpo.
Everything is working great.	Biribiara reyɛ adwuma kɛse.
Oral information is provided.	Wɔde nsɛm a wɔde ano ka ma.
He had no plans.	Ná onni nhyehyɛe biara.
So two things.	Enti nneɛma abien.
This should not be done by children.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ mmofra na wɔyɛ eyi.
Probably better than a man can handle them.	Ebia eye sen sɛnea ɔbarima betumi adi wɔn ho dwuma.
I'm lying outside.	Meda abɔnten.
Their father is gone.	Wɔn papa nni hɔ.
Who is that strange man?	Hena ne saa ɔbarima a ɔyɛ nwonwa no?
And they do that.	Na wɔyɛ saa.
And that is the case now.	Na ɛte saa mprempren.
So many things are going on.	Enti nneɛma pii rekɔ so.
But there were some bad years.	Nanso na mfe bɔne bi wɔ hɔ.
Whether you like it or not, you have to participate.	Sɛ wopɛ anaasɛ wompɛ no, ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu.
There was no one in the room.	Ná obiara nni dan no mu.
Even better than that.	Nea eye sen saa nso.
Hope you enjoy it, too!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho, nso!.
But we only have one more year.	Nanso yɛwɔ afe biako pɛ bio.
No one was in doubt.	Ná obiara nnye akyinnye.
You may not like that.	Ebia w’ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
Some days he barely had anything.	Nna bi wɔ hɔ a, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na onni hwee.
I can’t say it enough.	Mintumi nka no sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Or even put it to good use.	Anaasɛ mpo fa di dwuma yiye.
This is a new year.	Eyi yɛ afe foforo.
But first, one more.	Nanso nea edi kan no, biako bio.
But that’s exactly what happened recently.	Nanso ɛno ara ne nea esii nnansa yi ara.
His friends would be home now.	Ná ne nnamfo bɛba fie mprempren.
I don’t mean anything.	Me nkyerɛ hwee.
Only what must be true.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware nkutoo.
It’s a fascinating look back in time.	Ɛyɛ bere a atwam no mu hwɛ a ɛyɛ anigye.
Maybe you can help.	Ebia wubetumi aboa.
Nobody told me to do that.	Obiara anka ankyerɛ me sɛ menyɛ saa.
His fears were real.	Ná ne suro no yɛ nokware.
It’s a suburb.	Ɛyɛ kurow no akyi kurow bi.
I have no problem with this.	Minni ɔhaw biara wɔ eyi ho.
Life is short.	Nkwa yɛ tiaa.
This is simply not necessary.	Eyi ho nhia ara kwa.
Something hit my head.	Biribi bɔɔ me ti.
He knew that door.	Ná onim saa ɔpon no.
And you were amazing.	Na na wo ho yɛ nwonwa.
Not another person.	Ɛnyɛ onipa foforo.
That means everything.	Ɛno kyerɛ biribiara.
Maybe my idea is just wrong.	Ebia m’adwene no yɛ bɔne ara kwa.
The car was still there.	Ná kar no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
It’s too hard.	Ɛyɛ den dodo.
Always know them.	Hu wɔn bere nyinaa.
That’s what the policy says.	Ɛno ne nea nhyehyɛe no ka.
I'm always	Meyɛ bere nyinaa .
That’s neither here nor there.	Ɛno nyɛ ha anaa ha.
But its for mistakes.	Nanso ne ma mfomso.
That must have been difficult.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛno yɛ den.
He was wise to do so.	Ná nyansa wom sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
And the people have a say in everything.	Na nkurɔfo no wɔ asɛm bi ka wɔ biribiara mu.
They don’t like risk.	Wɔn ani nnye asiane ho.
This is not pretty but it works well.	Eyi nyɛ fɛ nanso ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
However, it is too late.	Nanso, aka akyi dodo.
It is a test of intelligence.	Ɛyɛ nyansa sɔhwɛ.
I’m just happy to be with you.	M’ani agye ara kwa sɛ me ne wo wɔ hɔ.
The window closed.	Mfɛnsere no bɔɔ mu.
The money came in quickly.	Sika no baa mu ntɛmntɛm.
I know it sounds like that, but it’s not true.	Minim sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa, nanso ɛnyɛ nokware.
My father was among them.	Ná me papa ka wɔn ho.
He liked to get bigger and stronger.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ kɛse na wayɛ den.
Apparently it was.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛte saa.
Which I just couldn’t believe.	Nea na mintumi nnye nni kɛkɛ.
You’re very interested in me.	W’ani gye me ho kɛse.
And we do, too.	Na yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa.
This is generally a good thing.	Mpɛn pii no, eyi yɛ ade pa.
The work was difficult.	Ná adwuma no yɛ den.
His mother taught school.	Ná ne maame kyerɛ ade wɔ sukuu mu.
We just had so little time.	Ná bere kakraa bi na yɛwɔ ara kwa.
I couldn’t even imagine that kind of money.	Ná mintumi nsusuw sika a ɛte saa ho mpo.
Be careful with the gun.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ tuo no ho.
That must have had something to do with it.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛno ne no wɔ biribi yɛ.
He was a child.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra.
As day turns to night.	Sɛnea awia dan anadwo no.
If it doesn’t work .	Sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma a .
Do not answer the phone.	Mfa telefon a wɔde gye telefon no so.
That house looks old.	Saa ofie no te sɛ nea akyɛ.
I didn’t go with anyone.	Me ne obiara ankɔ.
There were a few tests.	Ná sɔhwɛ ahorow kakraa bi wɔ hɔ.
I’m excited about these things.	M’ani agye saa nneɛma yi ho.
That’s why their sexual temptation is so great.	Ɛno nti na wɔn nna ho sɔhwɛ no yɛ kɛse saa no.
This creates another problem.	Eyi de ɔhaw foforo ba.
Trust me on this one.	Fa wo ho to me so wɔ eyi ho.
I wonder what hurts him.	Misusuw nea ɛyɛ no yaw ho.
It’s not hard either.	Ɛnyɛ den nso.
He was a great kid.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra kɛse.
I want you to	Mepɛ sɛ wo .
Surprisingly, we like him.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa no, yɛn ani gye ne ho.
Stay until at least midnight.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, tra hɔ kosi anadwo fã.
She was young and beautiful.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I feel for you.	Mete nka ma wo.
It’s a game for them.	Ɛyɛ agoru ma wɔn.
His hair was short.	Ná ne ti nhwi yɛ tiaa.
Everyone knows these things.	Obiara nim saa nsɛm yi.
Here are my plans for next week.	Me nhyehyɛe ahorow a mede bɛkɔ dapɛn a edi hɔ no ni.
Just get you into it.	Fa wo kɔ mu kɛkɛ.
Testing is what it is.	Sɔhwɛ ne nea ɛyɛ.
This situation is getting worse.	Tebea yi mu reyɛ den kɛse.
It’s very complicated.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den yiye.
It’s the best of the best.	Ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
Their views do not always reflect the general consensus.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na wɔn adwene no da adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa adi.
I worked for both of them.	Meyɛɛ adwuma maa wɔn baanu nyinaa.
Like I was used.	Te sɛ nea wɔde me dii dwuma no.
You can use it over a number of years.	Wubetumi de adi dwuma wɔ mfe dodow bi mu.
However, it is a good thing to do.	Nanso, ɛyɛ ade pa a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I can’t express myself very well.	Mintumi nkyerɛ me ho yiye koraa.
Things weren’t perfect.	Ná nneɛma nyɛ pɛ.
That’s right, water.	Ɛte saa, nsu.
I didn’t want to be one.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ biako.
There is nothing left for me to do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a aka sɛ mɛyɛ.
I think you have a problem.	Misusuw sɛ wowɔ ɔhaw bi.
This is a test people, for me this is.	Eyi yɛ sɔhwɛ nkurɔfo, me fam no eyi ne.
Without me, you are nothing.	Sɛ me nni hɔ a, wonyɛ hwee.
It shouldn’t be that long.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ tenten saa.
It was just awesome.	Ná ɛyɛ hu ara kwa.
That’s pretty much it this week.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ne dapɛn yi.
Food and lots of food.	Aduan ne aduan pii.
But it was a strange situation.	Nanso na ɛyɛ tebea a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I don't know why this should be.	Minnim nea enti a ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ saa.
But this experiment did not end here.	Nanso saa sɔhwɛ yi ankɔ awiei wɔ ha.
They are quite easy on the eyes.	Wɔyɛ mmerɛw koraa wɔ ani so.
He leaned against the door.	Ɔde ne ho too ɔpon no so.
He does nothing anymore.	Ɔnyɛ hwee bio.
Still can’t believe it.	Da so ara ntumi nnye nni.
They are both in the same door.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa wɔ ɔpon biako mu.
And without that.	Na sɛ ɛno nni hɔ a.
On weekends, there were very few.	Wɔ dapɛn awiei no, na kakraa bi pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I don’t want this to be just another one.	Mempɛ sɛ eyi bɛyɛ foforo ara kwa.
He is no longer a child.	Ɔnyɛ abofra bio.
It’s in the house.	Ɛwɔ fie hɔ.
The course is about to begin.	Adesua no reyɛ afi ase.
He knows it too well.	Onim no yiye dodo.
They speak many languages.	Wɔka kasa ahorow pii.
The only person he knew.	Onipa biako pɛ a na onim no.
So that part was a little difficult.	Enti na saa fã no yɛ den kakra.
Tell us more about it.	Ka ho nsɛm pii kyerɛ yɛn.
Maybe we would have, in the past.	Ebia anka yɛbɛyɛ saa, bere bi a atwam.
Behind everything, he wanted it there.	Wɔ biribiara akyi no, na ɔpɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
You are a man.	Woyɛ ɔbarima.
It works great in the cold winters too.	Ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse wɔ awɔw bere a awɔw wom nso mu.
But he is not perfect.	Nanso ɔnyɛ pɛ.
This is a complete lie.	Eyi yɛ atoro koraa.
I may make another one, or just use this one.	Ebia mɛyɛ foforo, anaasɛ mede eyi bedi dwuma kɛkɛ.
I can't think of what.	Mintumi nsusuw dɛn ho.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na eyi betumi aba.
I want to go out more.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ abɔnten pii.
Should we or shouldn’t we.	So ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ anaasɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
It’s very, very wet.	Ɛyɛ nsu paa, paa.
It’s just something.	Ɛyɛ biribi kɛkɛ.
One day, he would be taken too.	Da bi, na wɔde no nso bɛkɔ.
A dog is a male dog.	Ɔkraman yɛ ɔkraman a ɔyɛ ɔbarima.
I want to do something, be someone.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi, meyɛ obi.
I could end it now.	Ná metumi de aba awiei mprempren.
In both cases.	Wɔ nsɛm abien no nyinaa mu.
We are here and we have a job to do.	Yɛwɔ ha na yɛwɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
But that is not the case now.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa mprempren.
I forget their names.	Me werɛ fi wɔn din.
This is what he was doing on the road.	Eyi ne nea na ɔreyɛ wɔ kwan so.
It’s a problem.	Ɛyɛ ɔhaw.
He seemed to like that.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
I don’t even have to say anything else.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meka biribi foforo mpo.
I have to look into it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu.
That’s pretty much how this thought process goes.	Ɛno ne ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ sɛnea saa adwene nhyehyɛe yi kɔ.
He put his father down.	Ɔde ne papa too fam.
But when things went wrong, he had no plans.	Nanso bere a nneɛma ankɔ yiye no, na onni nhyehyɛe biara.
It’s time to renew your license.	Ɛyɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wo tumi krataa no foforo.
This was a problem.	Ná eyi yɛ ɔhaw.
I am still doing that work.	Meda so ara reyɛ saa adwuma no.
Use the paper as little as possible.	Fa krataa no di dwuma kakraa bi sɛnea wubetumi.
And their story is their story.	Na wɔn asɛm no yɛ wɔn asɛm.
The child may be with them.	Ebia abofra no ka wɔn ho.
But that’s the first one.	Nanso ɛno ne nea edi kan.
Maybe it was there.	Ebia na ɛwɔ hɔ.
That was not the case here.	Saa na na ɛnte saa wɔ ha.
I only work here.	Meyɛ adwuma wɔ ha nkutoo.
I'm sorry for you.	Mepa wo kyɛw.
All in all, it looks amazing for a newbie like me.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ma obi a ɔyɛ foforo te sɛ me ara.
It’s so easy to do.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ.
But this much seemed impossible.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea pii yi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Many of his paintings were abstract.	Ná ne mfonini ahorow no pii yɛ nea ɛnyɛ adwene.
Hit it hard.	Bɔ no denneennen.
Tom glanced away.	Tom de n’ani kyerɛɛ baabi foforo.
I'm sure you know about it.	Migye di sɛ wunim ho asɛm.
The use of a gun.	Tuo a wɔde di dwuma.
Jobs are important here.	Nnwuma ho hia wɔ ha.
That’s all there is to it.	Ɛno ara ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na eyi te saa.
Just do whatever you want to do.	Yɛ biribiara a wopɛ sɛ woyɛ ara kwa.
He wanted to think more about the matter.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ osusuw asɛm no ho kɛse.
His mind was filled with him.	N’adwene hyɛɛ no ​​ma.
I would have done you a favor.	Anka mɛyɛ wo yiye.
This will be a difficult task.	Eyi bɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den.
I brought you into this.	Mede wo baa eyi mu.
I hope you put it to good use.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wode bedi dwuma yiye.
I am not in the habit of being late for anything.	Ɛnyɛ me su sɛ mɛka akyi wɔ biribiara ho.
I find that very interesting.	Mihu sɛ ɛno yɛ anigye yiye.
He was doing a lot.	Ná ɔreyɛ pii.
It’s a true story.	Ɛyɛ nokware.
Make this clear.	Ma eyi mu da hɔ.
What a terrible idea.	Adwene a ɛyɛ hu bɛn ara ni.
I'm in a way.	Meyɛ ɔkwan bi so.
He’s involved in it.	Ɔde ne ho ahyɛ mu.
That’s the age of most people here.	Ɛno ne mfe dodow a nnipa dodow no ara adi wɔ ha.
Children go back to school.	Mmofra san kɔ sukuu.
Maybe we don’t like it.	Ebia yɛn ani nnye ho.
But tell me what you think!.	Nanso ka nea wususuw kyerɛ me!.
Maybe we can go somewhere else.	Ebia yebetumi akɔ baabi foforo.
He had to do something.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
Really great house.	Ofie kɛse ankasa.
They are not alone.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn nkutoo.
That’s the best so far.	Ɛno ne nea eye sen biara de besi nnɛ.
It’s for him.	Ɛyɛ ma no.
While this works, it’s not very convenient.	Bere a eyi yɛ adwuma no, ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
The situation was getting dangerous.	Ná tebea no reyɛ nea asiane wom.
I’ve seen them before.	Mihuu wɔn pɛn.
No one knew about you.	Ná obiara nnim wo ho asɛm.
I feel like it’s the case.	Mete nka sɛ ɛte saa.
I see it happening to me.	Mihu sɛ ɛrekɔ so wɔ me ho.
It’s his way of doing things.	Ɛyɛ ne kwan.
There is usually not much.	Mpɛn pii no, nneɛma pii nni hɔ.
Many people are poor.	Nnipa pii di hia.
Inside me.	Wɔ me mu.
He thinks things through.	Osusuw nneɛma ho yiye.
It’s a bit of trial and error.	Ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ ne mfomso kakra.
I'm working on it.	Mereyɛ ho adwuma.
It was a good book.	Ná ɛyɛ nhoma pa.
And I get it.	Na me nsa ka.
It sounds pretty awesome.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu yiye.
He makes wonderful paintings.	Ɔyɛ mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
And this house, too.	Na saa ofie yi nso.
This is very important now.	Eyi ho hia yiye mprempren.
You have to do it right.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no yiye.
The faster the car, the better it looked.	Dodow a kar no tu mmirika ntɛmntɛm no, dodow no ara na na ɛyɛ fɛ.
I already understand what you said.	Mete nea wokae no ase dedaw.
Here it goes.	Ha ara na akɔ.
And that was just two days ago.	Na ɛno yɛ nna abien a atwam no ara kwa.
I really enjoyed it.	M’ani gyee ho ankasa.
I can’t get you out of my mind.	Me ntumi nnya wo mfi m’adwene mu.
He had touched her.	Ná ɔde ne nsa aka no.
I don’t want to hear it.	Mempɛ sɛ mete.
Put him in that car.	Fa no tra saa kar no mu.
I like loud music.	M’ani gye nnwom a ano yɛ den ho.
Boy, you are good at that.	Abarimaa, wo ho akokwaw wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
People are busy.	Nkurɔfo nni adagyew.
So, we have a lot of problems.	Enti, yɛwɔ ɔhaw pii.
He told her to smile.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no.
Big enough just for me.	Kɛse a ɛdɔɔso ma me nkutoo.
Look however you like.	Hwɛ sɛnea wopɛ biara.
Everything has been mostly positive.	Biribiara ayɛ nea ɛyɛ papa kɛse dodow no ara.
That’s not what you need to think about.	Ɛno nyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
There is nothing for you here.	Biribiara nni hɔ mma wo wɔ ha.
Maybe a few here and there.	Ebia kakraa bi wɔ ha ne ha.
There is a story behind every picture.	Asɛm bi wɔ mfonini biara akyi.
I’m not happy at all.	M’ani nnye koraa.
The problem is you.	Ɔhaw no ne wo.
I wasn’t too excited about it.	Ná m’ani nnye ho dodo.
I don’t know why that is.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
That was reciprocal.	Ná ɛno yɛ nea wɔde wɔn ho wɔn ho yɛ.
In such a collision, the two vehicles collided.	Wɔ ɔkwan a ɛte saa so no, kar abien no bɔɔ mu.
That was easy enough.	Ná ɛno yɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
And, you know, stay strong.	Na, wunim, kɔ so yɛ den.
I knew it was there.	Ná minim sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
Something was strange.	Ná biribi yɛ nwonwa.
It works really well for these things.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ankasa ma saa nneɛma yi.
He says something.	Ɔka biribi.
This is not a difficult one.	Eyi nyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
A squirrel lives.	Ɔkraman bi te ase.
The idea was getting stronger.	Ná adwene no reyɛ den.
No one really knows.	Obiara nnim ankasa.
Things like this.	Nneɛma te sɛ eyi.
And, they are very inexpensive.	Na, wɔn bo nyɛ den koraa.
He barely knew this man.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na onim saa ɔbarima yi.
But he has mine.	Nanso ɔwɔ me de bi.
This never happened.	Eyi anyɛ saa da.
At least not for these two studies.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ adesua abien yi de.
It was quite late in the evening.	Ná ɛyɛ anwummere koraa.
Unless you are working with this system.	Gye sɛ wo ne nhyehyɛe yi reyɛ adwuma.
It’s up to you to do that.	Ɛyɛ wo na woayɛ saa.
He can be very efficient.	Obetumi ayɛ obi a ɔyɛ adwuma yiye.
He is our best hope.	Ɔno ne yɛn anidaso a eye sen biara.
We can totally do this!.	Yebetumi ayɛ eyi koraa!.
And it was nothing at all.	Na na ɛnyɛ hwee koraa.
His mother was very careful with him.	Ná ne maame hwɛ yiye paa wɔ ne ho.
Whether he likes it or not.	Sɛ́ n’ani gye ho anaasɛ n’ani nnye ho no.
To me, they were the best.	Wɔ me fam no, na wɔyɛ nea eye sen biara.
The film tells the story of a strange child.	Sini no ka abofra bi a ɔyɛ nwonwa ho asɛm.
However, none of the claims are true.	Nanso, nsɛm a wɔka no mu biara nyɛ nokware.
This is very important to do.	Eyi ho hia paa sɛ woyɛ.
But the boy did not see this.	Nanso abarimaa no anhu eyi.
This is for two reasons.	Nneɛma abien nti na eyi te saa.
They are something in the next room.	Wɔyɛ biribi a ɛwɔ dan a edi hɔ no mu.
But not enough is the problem.	Nanso ɛnyɛ dodow a ɛdɔɔso ne ɔhaw no.
I’m so happy to be here.	M’ani agye yiye sɛ mewɔ ha.
I slip my hand into his.	Mede me nsa hyɛ ne de mu.
He knew something.	Ná onim biribi.
I want to do something awesome.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ hu.
I don’t want to hear it.	Mempɛ sɛ mete.
He immediately offers his hand.	Ɔde ne nsa ma ntɛm ara.
It lies limp on the bed.	Ɛda mpa no so a ayɛ mmerɛw.
I can’t be like them.	Mintumi nyɛ sɛ wɔn.
So for me, it’s the other way around.	Enti me deɛ, ɛyɛ ɔkwan foforo so.
It’s very surprising to me.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa yiye.
He has a hobby.	Ɔwɔ adwuma bi a n’ani gye ho.
But it’s still pretty smart.	Nanso ɛda so ara yɛ nyansa yiye.
But that was the way it was.	Nanso saa na na ɛte.
For the time being.	Mprempren de.
This book was very clear throughout.	Ná nhoma yi mu da hɔ yiye wɔ asɛm no nyinaa mu.
Without them, something would be wrong.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ wɔn a, anka biribi bɛyɛ bɔne.
I had to do that on mine.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa wɔ me de no so.
It is the present moment.	Ɛyɛ mprempren bere yi.
They have to be done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I can’t tell anyone.	Mintumi nka nkyerɛ obiara.
As time goes on.	Bere a bere kɔ so no.
And hopefully not the next one either.	Na anidaso wom sɛ ɛnyɛ nea edi hɔ no nso.
Discuss the misuse.	Ka sɛnea wɔde di dwuma bɔne no ho asɛm.
But the situation doesn’t work.	Nanso tebea no nyɛ adwuma.
This is a serious problem.	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
However, that is in the past.	Nanso, ɛno yɛ bere a atwam no.
What? 	Dɛn?
He knew what he was doing.	Ná onim nea ɔreyɛ.
Very interesting thought experiment, though.	Nanso, adwene mu sɔhwɛ a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
None of them have heard of such a house.	Wɔn mu biara nte ofie a ɛte saa ho asɛm.
I can say that.	Metumi aka saa.
But he has done so.	Nanso wayɛ saa.
The story itself.	Asɛm no ankasa.
He wasn't quite sure why.	Ná onnim nea enti a ɛte saa no yiye.
They all say that, you know.	Wɔn nyinaa ka saa, wunim.
I love the team here.	M’ani gye kuw a ɛwɔ ha no ho.
It could still happen one day.	Ɛda so ara betumi asi da koro.
I have no problem with owning a gun.	Minni ɔhaw biara wɔ tuo a mewɔ no ho.
He said that himself.	Ɔno ankasa nso kae saa.
I think it’s most important.	Misusuw sɛ ɛho hia sen biara.
I gave him everything.	Mede biribiara maa no.
It’s too expensive.	Ɛyɛ nea ne bo yɛ den dodo.
I believe there was.	Migye di sɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I’m excited.	M’ani agye.
You don’t have to say.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woka.
But this is not so new.	Nanso eyi nyɛ ade foforo saa.
Back leg time.	Akyi nan bere.
He has to go himself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa kɔ.
I have all of those things.	Mewɔ saa nneɛma no nyinaa.
It was the basement.	Ná ɛyɛ dan no ase.
He took the test.	Ɔyɛɛ sɔhwɛ no.
It’s a difficult thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ den.
Glad that worked out.	Anigye sɛ ɛno yɛɛ yiye.
I know him	Minim no .
This is a problem.	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw.
Finally, the guy! 	Awiei koraa no!
But a newbie is a newbie.	Nanso obi a ɔyɛ foforo yɛ obi a ɔyɛ foforo.
Too many years.	Mfe pii dodo.
I’d be more than happy.	M’ani begye ho kɛse.
Think about it.	Susuw ho hwɛ.
He was very knowledgeable.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a onim nneɛma yiye.
A strange but interesting book.	Nhoma a ɛyɛ nwonwa nanso ɛyɛ anigye.
Very good though.	Eye paa nanso.
And that I've spent a lot of time on them.	Na sɛ mede bere pii ahyɛ wɔn so.
He parked his car on the street.	Ɔde ne kar no sii abɔnten so.
Police need more information on this case.	Polisifo hia asɛm yi ho nsɛm pii.
We can even school our children at home.	Yebetumi mpo yɛn mma no sukuu wɔ fie.
It was like he wanted to be me, but better.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ me, nanso eye sen saa.
Sounds good to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye ma me.
Be like water.	Yɛ sɛ nsu.
I just wanted to know what was going on.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
Everyone brought it down.	Obiara de baa fam.
There is a whole city below that is full of people.	Kurow mũ bi wɔ ase hɔ a nnipa ahyɛ mu ma.
It’s not the truth.	Ɛnyɛ nokware no.
There are all the things available.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
The meeting was not over.	Ná nhyiam no ankɔ awiei.
my father said.	me papa kae sɛ.
Or not enough.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
The city is a great city.	Kurow no yɛ kurow kɛse bi.
You’re passionate about the game.	W’ani gye agoru no ho yiye.
Take this bus to the city.	Fa bɔs yi kɔ kurow no mu.
But this is not always done.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na wɔyɛ eyi.
So anyway, about my weekend.	Enti sɛnea ɛte biara, bɛyɛ me dapɛn awiei no.
I have plenty of time for him.	Mewɔ bere pii ama no.
It was a wonderful story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
They were both very excited about it.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa ani agye ho kɛse.
No other method worked.	Ɔkwan foforo biara antumi anyɛ yiye.
In the same year.	Wɔ afe koro no ara mu.
His eyes quickly moved from one to the other.	N’ani fii biako so kɔɔ foforo so ntɛmntɛm.
Thus, .	Ne saa nti, .
There is something in that.	Biribi wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
He had no money on him.	Ná onni sika biara wɔ ne so.
But, never lie to me again.	Nanso, nni atoro nkyerɛ me bio da.
Let’s do that and.	Momma nyɛ saa a na.
Remember, you have a job to do.	Kae sɛ wowɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
There was much here to admire.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ ha a ɛsɛ sɛ n’ani gye ho.
He tries very hard.	Ɔbɔ mmɔden yiye.
It is more important to be yourself	Ɛho hia kɛse sɛ woyɛ wo ho
The money is still only in paper form.	Sika no da so ara wɔ krataa so nkutoo.
Many of them have gone.	Wɔn mu pii akɔ.
We need to work on something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ biribi ho adwuma.
He seemed much warmer at this point.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ hyew kɛse wɔ saa bere yi mu.
Just pretty long.	Kɛkɛ a ɛyɛ fɛ tenten.
This is not clear.	Eyi mu nna hɔ.
There is thought and there is story.	Adwene wɔ hɔ na asɛm wɔ hɔ.
We need to be stronger.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ den kɛse.
We are the best.	Yɛn na yɛyɛ papa sen biara.
A dog ran into the front of his car.	Ɔkraman bi de mmirika bɔɔ ne kar no anim.
We have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
It doesn’t seem to be true.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nokware.
The way he was.	Sɛnea na ɔte no.
Two days later, that’s what happened.	Nna abien akyi no, ɛno ne nea esii.
Take me home.	Fa me kɔ fie.
He wanted to run headfirst into this man.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde ne ti tu mmirika kɔ ɔbarima yi nkyɛn.
He has been eyeing her for a month.	Ɔde n’ani asi ne so ɔsram biako ni.
The dog runs to the front door.	Ɔkraman no tu mmirika kɔ anim pon no ano.
But that’s not what happened last time.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea esii bere a etwaam no.
That is his right.	Ɛno ne ne hokwan.
Nothing quite like it.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ ɛno koraa.
It would have been.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
It seems perfect.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ pɛ.
And himself, too.	Na ɔno ankasa nso.
Not too much, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ pii dodo, ɔkwan biara so.
It was a wonderful picture.	Ná ɛyɛ mfonini a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I didn’t want to.	Ná mempɛ.
In this way, the.	Wɔ saa kwan yi so no,...
The production time was short.	Ná bere a wɔde yɛ nneɛma no yɛ tiaa.
It was soft but not hot.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw nanso na ɛnyɛ hyew.
Not even this one.	Ɛnyɛ eyi mpo.
I had no desire to tell him anything about myself.	Ná minni ɔpɛ biara sɛ mɛka me ho asɛm biara akyerɛ no.
They should not be relied upon.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn ho to so.
It’s good and good.	Ɛyɛ papa na eye.
I would give my life for it.	Anka mede me nkwa bɛma wɔ ho.
I feel the floor with my hands.	Mede me nsa te fam no nka.
That’s how you see it’s best.	Saa na wuhu sɛ ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
No one knew anything, no one saw him.	Ná obiara nnim hwee, na obiara nhu no.
That ended quickly.	Ɛno baa awiei ntɛmntɛm.
Put it under his arm.	Fa hyɛ ne nsa ase.
That must have been a mistake.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛno yɛ mfomso.
Maybe it’s the case.	Ebia ɛte saa.
Don’t take anything for granted.	Mfa biribiara nyɛ hwee.
You just work for me.	Woyɛ adwuma ma me ara kwa.
I wanted money anyway.	Ná mepɛ sika ɔkwan biara so.
He told her that he had a gun.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɔwɔ tuo.
I had to tell him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no.
Or leave again.	Anaasɛ fi hɔ bio.
The reason for this is unclear.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no mu nna hɔ.
Perhaps you are one of them.	Ebia woyɛ wɔn mu biako.
The past in the present.	Nea atwam wɔ mprempren mu.
I just don’t care anymore.	Me deɛ ɛnyɛ me asɛm bio kɛkɛ.
He is very hot.	Ɔyɛ hyew yiye.
However, not at the same time.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ bere koro no ara mu.
Time doesn’t work the way you think it does.	Bere nyɛ adwuma sɛnea wususuw no.
But he doesn’t really like it.	Nanso n’ani nnye ho ankasa.
It was just a terrible moment.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi a ɛyɛ hu ara kwa.
But not the end.	Nanso ɛnyɛ awiei no.
Certainly not his father.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ ne papa.
But you can do some of those things.	Nanso wubetumi ayɛ saa nneɛma bi.
That’s just the rumor.	Ɛno ne asɛm a wɔka no ara kwa.
Somehow they both found him.	Ɔkwan bi so no, wɔn baanu nyinaa huu no.
And what a boy he was.	Na hwɛ abarimaa bɛn ara na na ɔyɛ.
That took the rest of the day and the next.	Ɛno gyee da no fã a aka ne nea edi hɔ no.
I think mine was similar.	Misusuw sɛ na me de no te sɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
Confess your sins to me in writing.	Ka wo bɔne kyerɛ me wɔ krataa mu.
That way we can keep watching.	Saa kwan no so no yebetumi akɔ so ahwɛ.
We need to do better than this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nea eye sen eyi.
Why should you know?	Dɛn nti na ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu?
There were many.	Ná pii wɔ hɔ.
That will slow you down.	Ɛno bɛma woayɛ mmerɛw.
These books have been used in the classroom.	Wɔde nhoma ahorow yi adi dwuma wɔ sukuu dan mu.
There really is no language.	Kasa biara nni hɔ ankasa.
When trouble arises, the police arrive quickly.	Sɛ ɔhaw ba a, polisifo ba ntɛm.
They trusted in him to help them.	Wɔde wɔn ho too no so sɛ ɔbɛboa wɔn.
And nothing good ever comes of it.	Na biribi pa biara mfi mu mma da.
My people are here.	Me nkurɔfo wɔ ha.
But that option is not available to them.	Nanso saa kwan no nni hɔ mma wɔn.
The dog is kicking a cat!	Ɔkraman no rebɔ ɔkraman bi akyi!
The meeting should last two days.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nhyiam no di nna abien.
You are so well done!.	Woayɛ no yiye paa!.
In a way, he always was.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na ɔte saa bere nyinaa.
I think it was in his house.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛwɔ ne fie.
I just couldn’t have it.	Na mintumi nnya bi kɛkɛ.
This test is one of the most difficult.	Saa sɔhwɛ yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ den sen biara no mu biako.
And why people do it.	Na nea enti a nkurɔfo yɛ saa no.
He made many people.	Ɔyɛɛ nnipa pii.
So, be careful.	Enti, hwɛ yiye.
He is troubled by his children.	Ɔhaw ne mma no.
I give them away.	Mede wɔn ma.
I’m happy with mine.	M’ani gyee me de no ho.
I think it’s that narrative.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ saa asɛm a wɔka no.
Do it right this time.	Yɛ no yiye saa bere yi.
You need to consider a new system.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw nhyehyɛe foforo a wode bedi dwuma ho.
There were very few books.	Ná nhoma kakraa bi pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Like, every day.	Te sɛ, da biara.
But please don’t tell my mother.	Nanso mesrɛ wo, nka nkyerɛ me maame.
Obviously not you.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ wo.
He told me you might as well say it.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ ebia wobɛka no saa.
He should have taken care of them first.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ odi kan hwɛ wɔn ho.
That everything happened for a reason.	Sɛ biribiara sii wɔ biribi nti.
I forget the rest.	Me werɛ fi nea aka no.
My mother’s mother.	Me maame maame.
But we have to do that.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
It was the same thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade koro no ara.
That’s a really big deal.	Ɛno yɛ ade kɛse ankasa.
I'm sure he would have.	Migye di sɛ anka ɔbɛyɛ saa.
No one is ever where you want them to be.	Obiara nni baabi a wopɛ no da.
I knew the truth.	Ná minim nokware no.
An idea whose time has come.	Adwene a ne bere adu.
He drove away after that.	Ɔde kar no kɔɔ baabi wɔ ɛno akyi.
That makes it more painful.	Ɛno ma ɛyɛ yaw kɛse.
No one ever did that.	Obiara anyɛ saa da.
I want to be someone.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ obi.
A little for housework.	Kakraa bi ma ofie adwuma.
I just received mine today.	Me nsa aka me de no nnɛ ara pɛ.
That too can be done.	Ɛno nso betumi ayɛ yiye.
My time had definitely come.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na me bere adu.
I love working in the house.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ adwuma wɔ fie hɔ.
I believed that.	Migye dii saa.
There was no one there.	Ná obiara nni hɔ.
Your books are wonderful.	Wo nhoma ahorow no yɛ nwonwa.
You have to do two more things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nneɛma abien bio.
The following articles do not.	Nsɛm a edi hɔ no nyɛ saa.
I looked good and felt so good.	Ná me ho yɛ fɛ na na mete nka sɛ meyɛ papa yiye.
It would seem questionable.	Ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea asɛm wɔ ho.
This is what you need to do immediately.	Eyi ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ntɛm ara.
Not very exciting.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
The floor is soft.	Fam no yɛ mmerɛw.
So it’s weird here.	Enti ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ha.
A few had money, and most did not.	Ná nnipa kakraa bi wɔ sika, na na dodow no ara nni hɔ.
His speech was fascinating.	Ná ne kasa no yɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
And it worked for me.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma ma me.
Go girl power.	Kɔ abeawa tumi.
And the reason isn’t obvious at first glance.	Na nea enti a ɛte saa no nna adi wɔ bere a edi kan a wuhu no mu.
He just slipped out.	Ɔde ne ho fii adi ara kwa.
But it was a good party, and he had done well.	Nanso na ɛyɛ apontow pa, na na wayɛ yiye.
What half of it means.	Nea ne fã kyerɛ.
It would be too dangerous.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea asiane wom dodo.
He is at home.	Ɔwɔ fie.
Here is why it is so.	Nea enti a ɛte saa ni.
The conclusion surprised even them.	Nsɛm a wɔde baa awiei no maa wɔn mpo ho dwiriw wɔn.
It’s not just me.	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo de.
However, he is no longer there.	Nanso, onni hɔ bio.
So in other words.	Enti wɔ ɔkwan foforo so no.
There was just something about him that wasn’t real.	Na biribi wɔ ne ho ara kwa a ɛnyɛ nokware.
Two things inside.	Nneɛma abien a ɛwɔ mu.
I know he can.	Minim sɛ obetumi.
I look at music the same way.	Mehwɛ nnwom saa ara.
The strong, strong hand lifted her up.	Nsa a ɛyɛ den na ɛyɛ den no maa no so.
This room was empty.	Ná hwee nni saa dan yi mu.
But you can make them.	Nanso wubetumi ayɛ wɔn.
It’s hot today.	Ɛyɛ hyew nnɛ.
I knew it would be.	Ná minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
My father had many plans.	Ná me papa wɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow pii.
It might be better this way.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa wɔ saa kwan yi so.
Use as little water as possible.	Fa nsu kakraa bi di dwuma sɛnea wubetumi.
You have to be one.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biako.
So, will you come with me?	Enti, wo ne me bɛba?
He had his eyes on her.	Ná n’ani da ne so.
You can try to do it at any age.	Wubetumi abɔ mmɔden sɛ wobɛyɛ mfe biara.
Everyone seemed to have to talk about it.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ obiara ka ho asɛm.
No human can say this.	Onipa biara nni hɔ a obetumi aka eyi.
He just didn't want to work on anything anymore.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribiara ho adwuma bio kɛkɛ.
The cost is minimal.	Ɛho ka yɛ kakraa bi.
He must have bought them clothes too.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔno nso tɔɔ ntade maa wɔn.
Their feet should be clean and flawless.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn nan mu da hɔ na mfomso biara nni ho.
The following article may help you.	Asɛm a ɛwɔ ase ha no betumi aboa wo.
Only for actual use.	Wɔde bedi dwuma ankasa nkutoo.
I don’t know you either.	Minnim wo nso.
But he was just a nice guy, a really nice guy.	Nanso na ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa ara kwa, ɔbarima pa ankasa.
There was my cell.	Ná me afiase dan no wɔ hɔ.
If he was good.	Sɛ na ɔyɛ papa a.
It’s been really cold here.	Awɔw ayɛ wɔ ha ankasa.
He is not wrong.	Ɔnyɛ mfomso.
However, I believe it was on the ground.	Nanso, migye di sɛ na ɛwɔ fam.
Probably a few days.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ nna kakraa bi.
And those people will make mistakes.	Na saa nkurɔfo no bedi mfomso.
They are beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
That just means so much to us.	Ɛno kyerɛ pii ara kwa ma yɛn.
But it doesn’t seem to work.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I really enjoyed the whole moment.	M’ani gyee saa bere no nyinaa ho ankasa.
Assume that is true.	Fa no sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
It’s not a part of it.	Ɛnyɛ ne fã bi.
Wear something warm.	Hyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ hyew.
Sounds good to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye ma me.
There were many things.	Na nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ.
You didn’t know where you were.	Na wunnim baabi a wowɔ.
He is a good man.	Ɔyɛ onipa pa.
What a wonderful songbook.	Nnwom nhoma a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni.
But it’s not really that complicated.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den saa ankasa.
That will cause all sorts of problems.	Ɛno de ɔhaw ahorow nyinaa bɛba.
However, the content of the study does not apply to this issue.	Nanso, adesua no mu nsɛm mfa saa asɛm yi ho.
I wanted to get my hands on the game.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mede me nsa hyɛ agoru no mu.
They were shocked by the idea.	Adwene no maa wɔn ho dwiriw wɔn.
Hope you enjoy it!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho!.
Another picture can be added here.	Yebetumi de mfonini foforo aka ho wɔ ha.
I prefer the normal human form.	Mepɛ onipa su a ɔte ase no.
The real story here is new.	Asɛm ankasa a ɛwɔ ha no yɛ foforo.
What is behind this door?	Dɛn na ɛwɔ ɔpon yi akyi?
Certainly, every month.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, ɔsram biara.
It’s absolutely the case.	Ɛte saa koraa.
I know it’s not much.	Minim sɛ ɛnyɛ pii.
You can do what you want with him.	Wubetumi ne no ayɛ nea wopɛ.
New money in old hands.	Sika foforo a ɛwɔ nsa dedaw mu.
Were you involved in that project?	So na wode wo ho hyɛɛ saa adwuma no mu?
The same is true of	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ .
But our costs are real.	Nanso yɛn ka yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
They didn’t like me.	Ná wɔn ani nnye me ho.
The song had no lyrics.	Ná dwom no mu nsɛm biara nni mu.
But at the same time, it’s beautiful.	Nanso bere koro no ara mu no, ɛyɛ fɛ.
At the same time nothing was the same.	Bere koro no ara mu no na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ nea ɛte no ara.
This leads to interesting results.	Eyi de nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye fi mu ba.
He would have given his life for her.	Anka ɔde ne nkwa bɛma ama no.
One way or another, they were a nuisance.	Ɔkwan biako so anaa ɔkwan foforo so no, na wɔyɛ ɔhaw.
Always a problem.	Ɔhaw bere nyinaa.
It seemed the best.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eye sen biara.
No one had a name.	Ná obiara nni din.
This thing is simple.	Saa ade yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I have a good job.	Mewɔ adwuma pa.
However, it is not without its problems.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea ɔhaw biara nni ho.
That seems pretty interesting.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ anigye yiye.
I had no clue about the plan.	Ná minni nhyehyɛe no ho biribiara.
That is not the reason.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
Many cars were still working.	Ná kar pii da so ara yɛ adwuma.
He knew the first one.	Ná onim nea edi kan no.
So at least we can have fun tonight.	Enti anyɛ yiye koraa no, yebetumi anya anigye anadwo yi.
So just keep your eyes peeled.	Enti ma w’ani nna hɔ ara kwa.
If you think you have that.	Sɛ wususuw sɛ wowɔ saa a.
He is what he says he is.	Ɔno ne nea ɔka sɛ ɔyɛ.
Last night was the first.	Anadwo a etwaam no ne nea edi kan.
The best may take a few days.	Ebia nea eye sen biara no begye nna kakraa bi.
A bad idea.	Adwene bɔne bi.
Many believed it was their best song.	Ná nnipa pii gye di sɛ ɛno ne wɔn dwom a eye sen biara.
Let the power be with you.	Ma tumi no nka wo ho.
There is a lot of work to be done here.	Adwuma pii wɔ ha a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
The work was difficult.	Ná adwuma no yɛ den.
The situation was tense.	Ná tebea no mu yɛ den.
The number of these things is huge.	Saa nneɛma yi dodow yɛ kɛse.
Something is going wrong.	Biribi rekɔ so anyɛ yiye.
I put so much thought into it.	Mede adwene pii saa hyɛɛ mu.
Maybe it’s not good.	Ebia ɛnyɛ papa.
Maybe not such a good idea now that you think about it.	Ebia ɛnyɛ adwene pa a ɛte saa mprempren a wususuw ho no.
Not the insert.	Ɛnyɛ nea wɔde hyɛ mu no.
And that was only for one year.	Na ɛno yɛ afe biako pɛ.
Something good comes from every bad thing.	Biribi pa fi bɔne biara mu.
The story is just beginning.	Asɛm no afi ase ara kwa.
I definitely feel that way.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mete nka saa.
But this doesn’t work.	Nanso eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
However, it still could have been a lot better.	Nanso, anka ɛda so ara betumi ayɛ papa pii.
No one can doubt that.	Obiara ntumi nnye saa asɛm no ho kyim.
I will share a story with them.	Me ne wɔn bɛka asɛm bi.
But many did.	Nanso pii yɛɛ saa.
That had been almost a year ago.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛno aba afe biako a atwam ni.
The girl pointed at the man.	Abeawa no de ne nsa kyerɛɛ ɔbarima no so.
So he knows what the game plan is.	Enti onim nea agoru nhyehyɛe no yɛ.
I’m interested in new things.	M’ani gye nneɛma foforo ho.
We can talk about anything.	Yebetumi aka biribiara ho asɛm.
Why is she so beautiful?	Dɛn nti na ne ho yɛ fɛ saa?
I love that you can work.	M’ani gye ho sɛ wubetumi ayɛ adwuma.
These animals are terrible.	Saa mmoa yi yɛ hu paa.
The eyes of a man.	Ɔbarima bi ani.
It’s happening, right now.	Ɛrekɔ so, seesei ara.
Believe me, he’s a nice guy.	Gye me di, ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
There is absolutely no way.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ koraa.
And that worked for them.	Na ɛno yɛɛ adwuma maa wɔn.
Always will and always.	Bere nyinaa bɛyɛ na bere nyinaa.
Things could easily get out of hand.	Ná ɛnyɛ den sɛ nneɛma betumi afi ne ho so.
We are the power.	Yɛn na yɛyɛ tumi no.
I want to see him get better.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛ ne ho bɛyɛ yiye.
I can handle things from here.	Metumi adi nneɛma ho dwuma afi ha.
And another, and another.	Na foforo nso, ne foforo nso.
This all happened during the month .	Eyi nyinaa sii wɔ ɔsram no mu .
Maybe something would happen.	Ebia na biribi bɛba.
Don’t think about a moment.	Nsusuw bere tiaa bi ho.
Just the difficulty.	Nea ɛyɛ den ara kwa.
It all works now.	Ne nyinaa yɛ adwuma mprempren.
So maybe.	Enti ebia.
There need not be any one such thing.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ade biako a ɛte saa biara wɔ hɔ.
I wanted to get to know you better.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu wo yiye.
I did the same thing.	Meyɛɛ saa ara.
Another three years.	Mfe abiɛsa foforo nso.
Maybe material for another article!.	Ebia nneɛma a wɔde bɛyɛ asɛm foforo!.
But no one knew what to do.	Nanso na obiara nnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I can tell you.	Metumi akyerɛ wo.
A good thing to consider, though.	Nanso, ade pa a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
But that’s all old news.	Nanso ɛno nyinaa yɛ asɛm dedaw.
First, the background.	Nea edi kan no, asɛm a ɛwɔ akyi no.
I made all these arrangements.	Meyɛɛ nhyehyɛe yi nyinaa.
We do indeed have.	Yɛwɔ ampa.
Their real names would come later.	Ná wɔn din ankasa bɛba akyiri yi.
Nothing was the same as before.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na ɛte sɛ kan no.
It’s a beautiful car in its own right.	Ɛyɛ kar a ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ ankasa mu.
Many factors can contribute to this.	Nneɛma pii betumi ama eyi aba.
Probably half that time.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ saa bere no fã.
Inappropriate.	Ɛnyɛ papa.
For me it was such a positive story so far.	Wɔ me fam no na ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ papa saa de besi nnɛ.
Everything is expensive these days.	Biribiara bo yɛ den nnansa yi.
It’s just amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
None of that is interesting.	Ɛno mu biara ani nnye ho.
And it wasn’t water.	Na ɛnyɛ nsu.
First time, last time.	Bere a edi kan, nea etwa to.
Language issues in the book.	Kasa ho nsɛm wɔ nhoma no mu.
I just can’t get used to them.	Mintumi nyɛ wɔn su kɛkɛ.
It certainly wasn’t his style.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛnyɛ ne su no.
It was hot in the summer and cold in the winter.	Ná ɛyɛ hyew wɔ awɔw bere mu na na awɔw wom wɔ awɔw bere mu.
One of these days, things might just work out here.	Nna yi mu biako, ebia nneɛma bɛkɔ yiye wɔ ha ara kwa.
It’s still going on.	Ɛda so ara kɔ so.
I put it next to him.	Mede too ne nkyɛn.
There were a lot of problems with that.	Ná ɔhaw pii wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Besides, who knows?.	Ɛno akyi no, hena na onim?.
I don’t know what it is.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ.
You have as much right to it as anyone ever has.	Wowɔ hokwan pii wɔ ho sɛnea obiara anya pɛn no.
Do whatever you have to do.	Yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biara.
Bikes were packed in the bike rack.	Ná sakre ahorow ahyɛ sakre dan no mu.
His experiment was equally impressive.	Ná ne sɔhwɛ no nso yɛ nwonwa saa ara.
You probably think it’s the real me, and maybe it is.	Ebia wususuw sɛ ɛyɛ me ankasa no, na ebia ɛte saa.
Like the rest of the population.	Te sɛ nnipa dodow a aka no.
You told us that.	Wo na woka kyerɛɛ yɛn saa.
Not fast enough.	Ɛnyɛ ntɛmntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
This was very easy and quick.	Ná eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye na ɛyɛ ntɛm.
He has added more over time.	Ɔde bi aka ho bere a bere kɔ so no.
I want to do anything else.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi foforo biara.
Not so good with people.	Ɛnyɛ papa saa wɔ nnipa ho.
It’s just me.	Ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
That was definitely something new.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛno yɛ ade foforo.
The same is true of happiness.	Saa ara na anigye nso te.
I don’t know if it’s still there.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ anaa.
So he does it with everyone else.	Enti ɔne obiara a aka no yɛ.
Throughout that time, we were the only kind of people there.	Wɔ saa bere no nyinaa mu no, na yɛn nkutoo ne nnipa ahorow a na yɛwɔ hɔ.
He thought that was interesting.	Ná osusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ anigye.
But that’s pretty much all.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno nkutoo.
That’s not surprising.	Ɛno nyɛ nwonwa.
It’s a false statement.	Ɛyɛ atoro nsɛm.
You almost know he has it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wunim sɛ ɔwɔ bi.
I am getting used to things.	Mereyɛ nneɛma ho su.
He has a face.	Ɔwɔ anim bi.
I had that one again a day later.	Ná mewɔ saa biako no bio da koro akyi.
There is nothing else he can do.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
Completely, completely wrong.	Mfomso koraa, koraa.
At least in this school.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ sukuu yi mu.
Didn't really have time to do it though.	Ɛnyɛ ankasa nyaa bere a mede bɛyɛ no de, nanso.
Time was running out.	Ná bere reyɛ tiaa.
This is quite a lot.	Eyi yɛ pii koraa.
But it seemed unlikely.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
A march had begun.	Ná nantew bi afi ase.
I am among the best.	Meka wɔn a wɔyɛ papa sen biara no ho.
Someone knew what it was like.	Ná obi nim sɛnea ɛte.
The one no one wants.	Nea obiara mpɛ no.
But you don’t have to do it manually.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ wode nsa yɛ.
So was everything else.	Saa ara na na biribiara a aka no nso te.
There were few things he loved more.	Ná nneɛma kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ a n’ani gye ho sen saa.
This was a bad idea.	Ná eyi yɛ adwene bɔne.
Don’t feel like you have to.	Nte nka sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
It always is, always will be.	Ɛwɔ hɔ bere nyinaa, ɛbɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
That doesn’t even seem possible.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye mpo.
This is not the only use.	Ɛnyɛ eyi nkutoo ne nea wɔde di dwuma.
You could have just said you know.	Anka wubetumi aka kɛkɛ sɛ wunim.
He just didn't want to do that.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa ara kwa.
Don’t be too concerned, though.	Nanso, mma wo ho nhia wo dodo.
Think about it and get back to us.	Susuw ho na san kɔ yɛn nkyɛn.
Use.	Fa di dwuma.
But there was nothing he could do.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
It doesn’t have all the details.	Ɛnyɛ nsɛm no nyinaa na ɛwɔ mu.
Hence the investment.	Enti na sika a wɔde hyɛ mu no.
The projects come to me .	Nnwuma no ba me nkyɛn .
I’ll be happy to say whatever you want, you know.	M’ani begye sɛ mɛka nea wopɛ biara, wunim.
Not surprising there.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa wɔ hɔ.
There seemed to be a great power here.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea tumi kɛse bi wɔ ha.
Do that.	Yɛ saa.
And this is the case.	Na eyi te saa.
He will give everything he has.	Ɔde biribiara a ɔwɔ bɛma.
As if there is only one book.	Te sɛ nea nhoma biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
It’s not entirely realistic.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware koraa.
That’s the bottom line!.	Ɛno ne asɛm a ɛwɔ ase!.
I agreed with him.	Me ne no yɛɛ adwene.
Maybe the whole thing was over and maybe it was that good.	Ebia na ade no nyinaa aba awiei na ebia na eye saa.
Think about your dog.	Susuw wo kraman no ho hwɛ.
I am part of him, he is part of me.	Meyɛ ne fã, ɔno nso yɛ me fã.
It has been around for a long time.	Ɛte hɔ bere tenten ni.
And yet, none of them were there for him.	Na nanso, na wɔn mu biara nni hɔ mma no.
So? 	Nti?
He did think about this.	Osusuw eyi ho ampa.
And not even the one outside.	Na ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ abɔnten no mpo.
And that would be three.	Na ɛno bɛyɛ abiɛsa.
Eventually, that can get a little old.	Awiei koraa no, ɛno betumi ayɛ dedaw kakra.
But now he is getting stronger.	Nanso seesei ɔreyɛ den.
Tell us more about them.	Ka wɔn ho nsɛm pii.
The difficulty with this approach lies in the control.	Nea ɛyɛ den wɔ saa kwan yi so no wɔ tumi a wɔde di dwuma no so.
The beast fell.	Aboa no hwee ase.
It’s a long story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm tenten bi.
A lot of this is about time.	Eyi mu pii fa bere ho.
Like we both just knew we had it.	Te sɛ nea na yɛn baanu nyinaa nim sɛ yɛwɔ bi kɛkɛ.
Children can be vulnerable.	Mmofra betumi ayɛ mmerɛw.
And old, so very old.	Na dedaw, enti akyɛ yiye.
Even that doesn’t seem to be me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno mpo nyɛ me.
However, we can work on that.	Nanso, yebetumi ayɛ saa asɛm no ho adwuma.
The accident closed the highway for several hours.	Akwanhyia no maa ɔkwan kɛse no too mu nnɔnhwerew pii.
Old friends, new, true.	Nnamfo dedaw, foforo, nokware.
Could he have done that.	So na obetumi ayɛ saa.
You become attached to your home.	Wobɛyɛ obi a ɔde ne ho ahyɛ wo fie.
We need to act immediately.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi ntɛm ara.
You have the right to do so.	Wowɔ hokwan sɛ woyɛ saa.
They are the ones who do their job.	Wɔn na wɔyɛ wɔn adwuma.
Mom was on the phone again.	Ná Maame wɔ telefon so bio.
But there was danger.	Nanso na asiane wɔ hɔ.
Many of us were very impressed with him.	Yɛn mu pii ani gyee ne ho paa.
After this, he hardly liked her.	Eyi akyi no, na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na n’ani nnye ne ho.
You know the problem well.	Wunim ɔhaw no yiye.
So it is real and real.	Enti ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa na ɛyɛ nokware.
You’ve been working on it for a long time.	Woayɛ ho adwuma akyɛ.
It can still be done.	Ɛda so ara betumi ayɛ.
I miss his touch.	Mepa ne nsa a ɔde kaa no no.
I can do that in any movie.	Metumi ayɛ saa wɔ sini biara mu.
That will continue to be the case.	Ɛno bɛkɔ so ayɛ saa.
Which is not modern enough.	Nea ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ nnɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
People are interested in it.	Nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
Few of us are enough.	Yɛn mu kakraa bi na ɛdɔɔso.
I hit him with everything.	Mede biribiara bɔɔ no.
I apologize for the former.	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ kan no ho.
I couldn’t see it clearly.	Ná mintumi nhu no yiye.
He knew he didn't want to.	Ná onim sɛ ɔmpɛ.
People keep coming every day.	Nkurɔfo kɔ so ba da biara da.
It just isn’t that.	Ɛnyɛ saa ara kwa.
And maybe that’s for the best.	Na ebia ɛno yɛ nea eye sen biara.
It should be easy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
What.	Dɛn.
In this case, it is good.	Wɔ eyi mu no, eye.
How do you say it.	Woka no dɛn.
What a man he would have been.	Ɔbarima bɛn na anka ɔbɛyɛ.
However, that is certainly not true.	Nanso, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno nyɛ nokware.
He seemed a little strange.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ nwonwa kakra.
I knew his mother well.	Ná minim ne maame yiye.
The music was hot.	Ná nnwom no yɛ hyew.
He knew everything and knew nothing.	Ná onim biribiara na na onnim hwee.
That doesn’t make it any better.	Ɛno mma ɛnyɛ papa koraa.
I know it sounds like enough.	Minim sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
But at least her feet spoke for her.	Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ne nan kasa maa no.
However, this cannot be true.	Nanso, eyi ntumi nyɛ nokware.
I could think of nothing else.	Ná mintumi nsusuw biribi foforo biara ho.
But there are few at any time.	Nanso kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ bere biara.
There is nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
You can definitely do better.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wubetumi ayɛ nea eye sen saa.
It’s a lot of fun.	Ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
Every day of the day.	Da biara da.
He wasn’t even that.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa mpo.
He wanted to do something by tomorrow.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi ansa na ɔkyena adu.
It was quite a mental project.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene mu adwuma bi ankasa.
However, a house.	Nanso, ofie bi.
I’d appreciate some help here.	M’ani begye mmoa bi ho wɔ ha.
There are no perfect people.	Nnipa a wɔyɛ pɛ biara nni hɔ.
That worked great.	Ɛno yɛɛ adwuma kɛse.
Take our way.	Fa yɛn kwan.
Jobs are scarce these days.	Nnwuma ho yɛ na nnansa yi.
Throughout the year.	Wɔ afe no mu nyinaa.
For me, it’s both.	Me fam no, ɛyɛ abien no nyinaa.
The situation seems hopeless.	Ɛte sɛ nea tebea no yɛ nea anidaso biara nnim.
It’s whoever he worked for.	Ɛyɛ obiara a ɔyɛɛ adwuma maa no.
And it was more expensive.	Na na ne bo yɛ den sen saa.
It wasn’t like that.	Ná ɛnte saa.
Heat it up.	Fa yɛ hyew.
These results are remarkable.	Nea afi mu aba yi yɛ nwonwa.
He did a good job in the story.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma pa wɔ asɛm no mu.
The products are always responsive.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ no yɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma bere nyinaa.
This is a really, really good book.	Eyi yɛ nhoma a eye ankasa, ankasa.
The song was old.	Ná dwom no akyɛ.
But these two are hardly literary at all.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ saa abien yi nyɛ nhoma mu nsɛm koraa.
There’s just so much information to work through.	Nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho adwuma kɛkɛ.
Their children are our children.	Wɔn mma yɛ yɛn mma.
Maybe they don’t matter.	Ebia wɔn ho nhia.
There were many different jobs.	Ná nnwuma ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
Next to the door was an old bed.	Ná mpa dedaw bi wɔ ɔpon no nkyɛn.
That’s just not good enough.	Ɛno nyɛ papa kɛkɛ.
We are very excited.	Yɛn ani agye paa.
This is not a simple majority.	Eyi nyɛ dodow no ara a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
But they are not as good as a human.	Nanso wɔn ho nyɛ papa te sɛ onipa.
I’m going to do that.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
It gets harder every year.	Ɛyɛ den kɛse afe biara.
At least he had some idea of ​​what he was feeling.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɔwɔ nea ɔte nka no ho adwene bi.
That’s what today is about, not the girl.	Ɛno ne nea nnɛ fa ho, ɛnyɛ abeawa no.
He had done so even as a child.	Ná wayɛ saa bere a na ɔyɛ abofra mpo.
No one ever did, then or since.	Obiara anyɛ saa da, saa bere no anaa ɛno akyi.
Her hair was okay.	Ná ne ti nhwi no nyɛ hwee.
I want him to do it.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
In any case, no one wants them.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, obiara mpɛ wɔn.
I know a lot of people.	Minim nnipa pii.
He lives somewhere in a big city.	Ɔte kurow kɛse bi mu baabi.
He must have known that.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na onim saa.
Anything else	Ade biara
Very few were completely flawless.	Ná kakraa bi pɛ na na mfomso biara nni ho koraa.
Review.	Hwɛ mu.
It was a lesson.	Ná ɛyɛ adesua.
I think they do.	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
The city got excited, he hurried.	Kurow no nyaa anigye, ɔyɛɛ ntɛm.
However, my mother did.	Nanso, me maame na ɔyɛɛ saa.
However, that is obviously not good enough anymore.	Nanso, ɛda adi sɛ ɛno nyɛ papa bio.
This could be anything.	Eyi betumi ayɛ biribiara.
That’s the problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
That’s their job and they both do it well.	Ɛno ne wɔn adwuma na wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ no yiye.
I think it’s him.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno.
It was the number that had to be said.	Ná ɛyɛ dodow a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka no.
We have to play with what we have.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde nea yɛwɔ no di agoru.
Perfectly handcrafted for your kitchen!	Wɔde nsa ayɛ no yiye ama wo dan mu aduan!
People travel there on foot.	Nkurɔfo de nantew tu kwan kɔ hɔ.
He is like that.	Ɔte saa.
And you should do the same.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ saa.
I can do that, no problem.	Metumi ayɛ saa, ɔhaw biara nni ho.
In other words.	Ɔkwan foforo so no.
It was a terrifying thought.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ hu.
Everyone was impressed.	Obiara ani gyee ho.
It’s not the end.	Ɛnyɛ awiei.
Or maybe you don’t.	Anaasɛ ebia wonyɛ saa.
All he has to do is tell the truth.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ara ne sɛ ɔbɛka nokware.
And it wasn’t good.	Na ɛnyɛ papa.
I wish you were a girl.	Me yam a anka woyɛ abeawa.
But now you know it’s not that easy.	Nanso seesei wunim sɛ ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
Every day of the day.	Da biara da.
I hope you enjoy them.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye wɔn ho.
New books, not used books.	Nhoma foforo, ɛnyɛ nhoma a wɔde adi dwuma.
All the animals were gone.	Ná mmoa no nyinaa nni hɔ bio.
Their speeches were often heated.	Ná wɔn kasa ahorow no taa yɛ hyew.
You had to do what you did.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nea woayɛ no.
We just have to plan for it every day.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho nhyehyɛe da biara da kɛkɛ.
And I’m not going to tell you.	Na m’ani nnye ho sɛ mɛka akyerɛ wo.
They were stories of one person’s longevity.	Ná ɛyɛ onipa biako nkwa tenten ho nsɛm.
I think this should work much faster.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma ntɛmntɛm kɛse.
I know too many things.	Minim nneɛma pii dodo.
It’s something we do.	Ɛyɛ biribi a yɛyɛ.
I hadn’t thought about it.	Ná minsusuw ho.
I’m so excited!.	M’ani gye ho!.
The dog paced back and forth, obviously unhappy.	Ɔkraman no de mmirika kɔɔ anim ne akyi, na ɛda adi sɛ na n’ani nnye ho.
Three hours. 	Nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa. 
Doing this is as dangerous as it gets.	Eyi a wobɛyɛ no yɛ nea asiane wom sɛnea ɛte no.
That made me feel weird, but in a good way.	Ɛno maa metee nka sɛ me ho yɛ nwonwa, nanso wɔ ɔkwan pa so.
His hands were missing.	Ná ne nsa nni hɔ.
He knows he is doing wrong.	Onim sɛ ɔreyɛ bɔne.
I can show them why.	Metumi akyerɛ wɔn nea enti a ɛte saa.
Even he did that.	Ɔno mpo yɛɛ saa.
So they tell us.	Enti wɔka kyerɛ yɛn.
As a result, there is limited information available for these individuals.	Ne saa nti, nsɛm kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ ma saa nnipa yi.

His speech was full of slurred words.	Ná nsɛm a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ahyɛ ne kasa mu ma.

We all have no power.	Yɛn nyinaa nni tumi.
This was not surprising.	Ná eyi nyɛ nwonwa.
I know it will be cheap.	Minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den.
They take each other away.	Wɔde wɔn ho wɔn ho kɔ.
Not that he knew about them.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na onim wɔn ho asɛm.
I can’t say anything yet.	Mintumi nka hwee de besi nnɛ.
This has happened in many cases.	Eyi aba wɔ nsɛm pii mu.
Tell you what the pictures mean.	Ka nea mfonini ahorow no kyerɛ ma wo.
We did great ourselves.	Yɛn ankasa yɛɛ ade kɛse.
I know that very well.	Minim saa yiye.
There are terrible things right there.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ hu wɔ hɔ ara.
Everything the man said was a lie.	Biribiara a ɔbarima no kae no yɛ atoro.
The information was from the target himself.	Ná nsɛm no fi nea wɔde wɔn ani asi so no ankasa hɔ.
You know you shouldn’t be here.	Wunim sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wowɔ ha.
But it was just the game.	Nanso na ɛyɛ agoru no ara kwa.
I am in them almost every day.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mewɔ wɔn mu da biara da.
Or what’s left of it.	Anaasɛ nea aka wɔ ho.
Not that he had to.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I don’t think it’s going to be that much more complicated.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den kɛse saa.
But mostly it’s me.	Nanso dodow no ara yɛ me.
He likes it here.	N’ani gye ho wɔ ha.
People are interested in new things.	Nkurɔfo ani gye nneɛma foforo ho.
But it is not	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa .
There are many people in the city.	Nnipa pii wɔ kurow no mu.
People looked out for each other when it mattered most.	Nkurɔfo hwɛɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho yiye bere a na ɛho hia kɛse no.
He leaned deeper into it.	Ɔde ne ho too mu kɔɔ akyiri.
This car is fast.	Saa kar yi yɛ ntɛmntɛm.
But it doesn’t feel like it, right now.	Nanso ɛnte sɛ nea ɛte, mprempren.
I have this one.	Mewɔ eyi.
He was a terrible person.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hu.
You know exactly why.	Wunim nea enti a ɛte saa no yiye.
He would give her that, he would give her whatever she wanted.	Ɔde saa bɛma no, ɔde nea ɔpɛ biara bɛma no.
Look, it’s only half of me, but it’s true.	Hwɛ, ɛyɛ me fã pɛ, nanso ɛyɛ nokware.
The boy was wearing shorts.	Ná abarimaa no hyɛ ntade tiaa.
Tell us the number, time and date.	Ka dodow, bere ne da no kyerɛ yɛn.
This should be good.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ papa.
Which of the children was the smartest?	Mmofra no mu hena na na ɔwɔ nyansa sen biara?
But everyone has one.	Nanso obiara wɔ bi.
I wanted more.	Ná mepɛ pii.
He was a strong man, and he lived alone.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa a ne ho yɛ den, na ɔno nkutoo na ɔte ase.
Those classes are not that hard.	Saa adesua ahorow no nyɛ den saa.
First, the story is interesting.	Nea edi kan no, asɛm no yɛ anigye.
The story didn’t end here.	Asɛm no ankɔ awiei wɔ ha.
Most likely you will.	Ɛda adi yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
It’s actually my father’s.	Ɛyɛ me papa de ankasa.
This is not surprising.	Eyi nyɛ nwonwa.
I think it’s easy.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
And it wasn’t.	Na ɛnte saa.
He didn't seem so interested.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani nnye ho saa.
But the most precious thing you gave me tonight.	Nanso ade a ne bo yɛ den sen biara a wode maa me anadwo yi.
Remove the stubborn hair.	Yi nhwi a ɛyɛ den no fi mu.
He did a really great job.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma kɛse ankasa.
This is his moment of authenticity.	Eyi ne ne bere a ɔde yɛ nokware no.
Do what you can for him.	Yɛ nea wubetumi biara ama no.
We couldn’t have gotten in trouble for anything.	Anka yɛrentumi nkɔ ɔhaw mu wɔ biribiara ho.
In both of them.	Wɔ wɔn baanu nyinaa mu.
It was a great evening.	Ná ɛyɛ anwummere kɛse bi.
This is a fascinating story.	Saa asɛm yi yɛ anigye.
But at least it was easy.	Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
You just know what needs to happen.	Wunim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
I’m interested in it.	M’ani gye ho.
None of that matters now.	Ɛno mu biara ho nhia mprempren.
The song was a huge success.	Dwom no dii yiye kɛse.
He will come with us.	Ɔne yɛn bɛba.
A house is a house.	Ofie yɛ fie.
Things are getting complicated.	Nneɛma reyɛ den.
The participant is not happy about this.	Nea ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu no ani nnye eyi ho.
I want to do the former not the latter.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ kan no na ɛnyɛ nea etwa to no.
It was good enough.	Ná eye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
This, even today, is not the case.	Eyi, nnɛ mpo, ɛnte saa.
That is the opportunity.	Ɛno ne hokwan no.
How you can overcome it.	Sɛnea wubetumi adi no so nkonim.
It’s not the fun part of this job.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma yi fã a ɛyɛ anigye.
Summer is hot.	Awɔw bere mu yɛ hyew.
He has a name.	Ɔwɔ din.
Sounds pretty good to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye ma me yiye.
I'm on the road.	Mewɔ kwan so.
Maybe someone knows more.	Ebia obi nim pii.
You know you are beautiful.	Wunim sɛ wo ho yɛ fɛ.
The whole music thing freaked them out.	Nnwom ade no nyinaa maa wɔn ho dwiriw wɔn.
It’s their right.	Ɛyɛ wɔn hokwan.

How many hours are you planning to work each week?	Nnɔnhwerew ahe na woreyɛ ho nhyehyɛe sɛ wobɛyɛ adwuma dapɛn biara?

The gun went off.	Tuo no bɔɔ.
There are still problems.	Ɔhaw ahorow da so ara wɔ hɔ.
And for a long time it did nothing.	Na bere tenten bi anyɛ hwee.
People do have their part.	Nnipa wɔ wɔn fã no ampa.
You'll be quick, won't you?	Wobɛyɛ ntɛm, ɛnte saa?
I still do that.	Meda so ara yɛ saa.
I do that every day.	Meyɛ saa da biara da.
But it didn’t look like him, it didn’t really look like him.	Nanso na ɛnte sɛ ɔno, na ɛnte sɛ ɔno ankasa.
It’s in his nature.	Ɛwɔ ne su mu.
But it doesn’t matter much.	Nanso ɛho nhia pii.
He must be there somewhere.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ wɔ baabi.
There are no services provided.	Nnwuma biara nni hɔ a wɔde ma.
It was home for so many years.	Ná ɛyɛ fie mfe pii saa.
The school bus was late.	Sukuu bɔs no kaa akyi.
He is here and there.	Ɔwɔ ha hɔ.
He doesn’t want to talk about it.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka ho asɛm.
I couldn’t let him.	Na mintumi mma no kwan.
A probable case.	Asɛm a ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ asɛm.
His mind had saved the day.	Ná n’adwene no agye da no nkwa.
I have something in my eyes.	Mewɔ biribi wɔ m’ani so.
What a great idea.	Adwene kɛse bɛn ara ni.
It’s not something that matters.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛho hia.
That was obviously a lie.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛno yɛ atoro.
Tell me what you can do.	Ka nea wubetumi ayɛ kyerɛ me.
You can see me now.	Wubetumi ahu me mprempren.
That’s going to happen.	Ɛno rekɔ so.
It’s something you want to work on.	Ɛyɛ biribi a wopɛ sɛ woyɛ ho adwuma.
Allow for that.	Ma kwan ma ɛno.

I still can’t get over them.	Meda so ara ntumi nni wɔn so.

This is not easy at all.	Eyi nyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
It was the first time he had ever touched her.	Ɛno ne bere a edi kan a ɔde ne nsa aka no pɛn.
Don’t be afraid.	Mma w’ani nnye.
Now it’s too late.	Seesei ɛyɛ nea aka akyi.
That would be great.	Ɛno bɛyɛ kɛse.
But maybe you can help me.	Nanso ebia wubetumi aboa me.
Take it for granted.	Fa no sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
My wife uses it too.	Me yere nso de di dwuma.
This has been a perfect day.	Eyi ayɛ da a edi mũ.
The conference includes one-day sessions.	Nhyiam no de da koro nhyiam ahorow ka ho.
There will be more information.	Nsɛm pii bɛba.
I felt alive.	Metee nka sɛ mete ase.
Another week has passed.	Dapɛn foforo nso atwam.
I feel like a child.	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ abofra.
And indeed the problem comes.	Na ampa ara ɔhaw no ba.
It all felt the same, though.	Nanso, na ne nyinaa te nka sɛ ɛte saa ara.
He did so.	Ɔyɛɛ saa.
And so it has been ever since.	Na saa na ɛte saa ara fi saa bere no.
Nothing has been the same since.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa ara fi saa bere no.
The total annual water consumption is approx.	Nsu a wɔde di dwuma afe biara nyinaa bɛyɛ.
Go, just like that.	Kɔ, saa ara.
Do yourself a favor.	Yɛ wo ho yiye.
My mind was clear.	Ná m’adwene mu da hɔ.
I wish you didn’t have to see me.	Me yam a anka ɛho nhia sɛ wuhu me.
One method works for a time.	Ɔkwan biako yɛ adwuma bere bi.
I don’t want him one.	Mempɛ no biako.
He drove the kids to school.	Ɔde mmofra no kaa kar kɔɔ sukuu.
That’s just not enough time.	Ɛno ara ne sɛ ɛnyɛ bere a ɛdɔɔso.
I don’t know what to do now.	Minnim nea menyɛ mprempren.
There was more of your day with you.	Na wo ne wo da no pii wɔ hɔ.
I didn’t know what it was.	Ná minnim nea ɛyɛ.
Nothing was possible.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na ɛyɛ yiye.
I knew then.	Ná minim saa bere no.
It’s much worse than that.	Ɛyɛ bɔne sen saa koraa.
His words apply more to the latter.	Ne nsɛm no fa akyiri yi no ho kɛse.
But it’s not surprising.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nwonwa.
The room was beautiful.	Ná dan no mu yɛ fɛ.
It just doesn’t work that way.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma saa ara kɛkɛ.
However, we had two problems.	Nanso, na yɛwɔ ɔhaw abien.
Once they had to do it.	Bere bi na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
The language became more difficult.	Kasa no yɛɛ den kɛse.
He was very much like me.	Ná ɔte sɛ me yiye.
Keep your eyes open, and keep working.	Ma w’ani nna hɔ, na kɔ so nyɛ adwuma.
People take it for a variety of reasons.	Nkurɔfo fa nneɛma ahorow nti.
It was an incredibly strange thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
No one could do it.	Obiara antumi anyɛ.
It was simple, but good.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw, nanso na eye.
Man had his way.	Ná onipa wɔ ne kwan.
They act great.	Wɔyɛ wɔn ade kɛse.
I doubt this.	Migye eyi ho kyim.
Most seemed less interested.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea dodow no ara ani nnye ho kɛse.
What are you planning next weekend.	Dɛn na woreyɛ ho nhyehyɛe dapɛn awiei a edi hɔ no.
But he is no danger.	Nanso ɔnyɛ asiane biara.
And it works really well.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
But it’s still there.	Nanso ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
To tell him how things are at home.	Sɛ ɔbɛka sɛnea nneɛma te wɔ fie akyerɛ no.
On closer inspection, it’s not fun.	Sɛ wuhu no yiye a, ɛnyɛ anigye.
Man for man.	Onipa ma onipa.
Either way, he has to try.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden.
The boy was shocked.	Abarimaa no ho dwiriw no.
But he really had one chance.	Nanso na ɔwɔ hokwan biako ankasa.
No one seems to know much about him.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara nnim ne ho nsɛm pii.
Two points are offered.	Wɔde nsɛm abien ma.
That is obviously not possible now.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye mprempren.
But you’ve done it.	Nanso woayɛ saa.
We should all strive to be good.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa bɔ mmɔden sɛ yɛbɛyɛ papa.
But this way too long.	Nanso saa kwan yi so no tenten dodo.
I could never forget about you.	Ná me werɛ ntumi mfi wo ho asɛm da.
Chill! 	Gye w'ani!
We just have today.	Yɛwɔ nnɛ ara kwa.
A similar problem.	Ɔhaw a ɛte saa ara.
If he was even in it again.	Sɛ na ɔwɔ mu mpo bio a.
I have made this picture.	Mayɛ saa mfonini yi.
It was an unseasonably cold day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a awɔw wom a ɛnyɛ bere mu de.
I wanted to say that.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka sɛ.
This was a huge mistake.	Ná eyi yɛ mfomso kɛse.
That is nothing new.	Ɛno nyɛ ade foforo.
But they are not alone.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wɔn nkutoo na wɔyɛ saa.
But are they really.	Nanso so wɔyɛ ampa.
But it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛnte saa.
That is never true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware da.
Go back to the scene.	San kɔ hɔ.
I'm the best.	Me a meyɛ papa.
That’s what kids do.	Saa na mmofra yɛ.
And good things did happen.	Na nneɛma pa sii ampa.
However, there are a few problems.	Nanso, ɔhaw kakraa bi wɔ hɔ.
No gun yet.	Tuo biara nni hɔ de besi nnɛ.
This shouldn’t be surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa.
It’s great now.	Ɛyɛ kɛse mprempren.
I wanted him to do anything and everything.	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribiara ne biribiara.
We could all do that.	Ná yɛn nyinaa betumi ayɛ saa.
It’s going to be.	Ɛrekɔ.
The human thing.	Onipa ade no.
Give the man a chance.	Ma ɔbarima no hokwan.
It’s a lot of work and it’s free.	Ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse na ɛyɛ kwa.
Thank you so much for dinner.	Meda mo ase pii wɔ anwummere aduan ho.
Don’t realize it’s happening.	Nhu sɛ ɛrekɔ so.
I'm lying on the bed.	Meda mpa so.
It’s something else.	Ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
I know what he wants.	Minim nea ɔpɛ.
He was terrible.	Ná ne ho yɛ hu.
In this case, it is not.	Wɔ eyi mu no, ɛnte saa.
You can eat it whenever you want.	Wubetumi adi bere biara a wopɛ.
There was no half.	Ná fã biara nni hɔ.
I’m in love with them.	M’ani gye wɔn ho.
A gunshot rang out.	Tuo bi bɔɔ denneennen.
I can't understand anything after that.	Mintumi nte biribiara ase wɔ ɛno akyi.
No animal can be human.	Aboa biara ntumi nyɛ onipa.
It wasn’t like she always was.	Na ɛnyɛ sɛnea na ɔyɛ bere nyinaa no.
The strongest survived.	Wɔn a wɔn ho yɛ den sen biara no nyaa nkwa.
There was nothing else to do.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I have a name.	Mewɔ din.
It is a recent problem.	Ɛyɛ ɔhaw a aba nnansa yi ara.
The police had no power.	Ná polisifo no nni tumi biara.
That’s why this afternoon is so wonderful.	Ɛno nti na awia yi yɛ nwonwa saa no.
But the story didn’t go away.	Nanso asɛm no ankɔ so ankɔ so.
It’s so hard to be strong right now.	Ɛyɛ den yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ den mprempren.
This was the case until this morning.	Ná eyi te saa de besi nnɛ anɔpa.
Next, take our practice tests.	Nea edi hɔ no, yɛ yɛn sɔhwɛ ahorow a yɛde yɛ adesua no.
And, there is some real hope.	Na, anidaso ankasa bi wɔ hɔ.
No one told me it would.	Obiara anka ankyerɛ me sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
It was too big.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse dodo.
They are somewhat interested.	Wɔn ani gye ho bi.
A whole new problem.	Ɔhaw foforo koraa.
But enough language.	Nanso kasa a ɛdɔɔso.
. . . .	.
I'll tell you the truth.	Me deɛ, mɛka nokware.
We were in his bedroom.	Ná yɛwɔ ne mpa mu.
Winter can’t take it anymore.	Awɔw bere ntumi nnye bio.
Be careful with that.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
It’s really amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
His hand on her arm.	Ne nsa a ɛwɔ ne nsa so.
Or any offer for that matter.	Anaasɛ biribiara a wɔde bɛma ama saa asɛm no.
That’s not all of this.	Ɛnyɛ eyi nyinaa ne no.
There is not much time.	Bere pii nni hɔ.
What we will do in the past.	Nea yɛbɛyɛ a atwam no.
Consumer prices have plummeted.	Nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma bo akɔ fam kɛse.
It’s quite simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
This sounds simple, but it’s not.	Eyi te sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw, nanso ɛnte saa.
It’s a really bad job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma bɔne ankasa.
More work than any of us can handle.	Adwuma pii sen sɛnea yɛn mu biara betumi ayɛ.
It should have been tonight.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anadwo yi.
I knew him.	Ná minim no.
And here’s another idea.	Na adwene foforo nso ni.
This book has all three.	Saa nhoma yi wɔ abiɛsa no nyinaa.
Most of your time is spent here.	Wo bere fã kɛse no ara na wode di dwuma wɔ ha.
The problem immediately.	Ɔhaw no ntɛm ara.
I’m glad he’s not in that.	M’ani agye sɛ onni saa asɛm no mu.
Over time, the problem itself does not solve itself.	Bere kɔ so no, ɔhaw no ankasa nni ho dwuma.
The man was strong.	Ná ɔbarima no ho yɛ den.
This story has everything.	Saa asɛm yi wɔ biribiara.
I think this is really it.	Misusuw sɛ eyi ne no ankasa.
He wasn’t there.	Ná onni hɔ.
You don’t even have to think about it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wususuw ho mpo.
One day.	Da koro.
Again very excited about it.	Bio nso anigye kɛse wɔ ho.
There was no one to help them.	Ná obiara nni hɔ a ɔbɛboa wɔn.
There are many good people who do the same thing.	Nnipa pa pii wɔ hɔ a wɔyɛ ade koro no ara.
It will work tomorrow.	Ɛbɛyɛ adwuma ɔkyena.
And a really long way.	Na ɔkwan tenten ankasa.
I felt bad for myself.	Me ho yɛɛ me yaw wɔ me ho.
A dog can fly off a dog.	Ɔkraman tumi tu fi ɔkraman bi so.
That would have been a game, something interesting.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ agoru, biribi a ɛyɛ anigye.
He lives for us.	Ɔte ase ma yɛn.
This had been a good idea.	Ná eyi ayɛ adwene pa.
He knows me too well.	Onim me yiye dodo.
Many people were shocked by the strange situation.	Nnipa pii ho dwiriw wɔn wɔ tebea a ɛyɛ nwonwa no ho.
Keep going, quickly.	Kɔ so, ntɛm.
Best furniture in room.	Nneɛma a eye sen biara wɔ dan mu.
The dog looked at him curiously.	Ɔkraman no de anigye hwɛɛ no.
People know very little about him.	Nkurɔfo nim ne ho nsɛm kakraa bi pɛ.
But there was hardly any of that.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛno mu biara nni hɔ.
This time around.	Saa bere yi de.
We both tried.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa bɔɔ mmɔden.
When money is involved, things tend to be weird.	Sɛ sika ka ho a, nneɛma taa yɛ nwonwa.
What a thought this is.	Adwene bɛn ara ni.
However, it didn’t do much for me.	Nanso, anyɛ pii amma me.
I felt very used.	Metee nka sɛ wɔde me adi dwuma kɛse.
He had time for everyone.	Ná ɔwɔ bere ma obiara.
Let him keep doing nothing.	Ma no nkɔ so nyɛ hwee.
People are afraid of him.	Nkurɔfo suro no.
My pain saved my life.	Me yaw no gyee me nkwa.
Moreover, there is much to be done.	Bio nso, nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
We are the same age, and the same size as children.	Yɛn mfe yɛ pɛ, na yɛn kɛse te sɛ mmofra.
I see that perfectly well.	Mihu saa asɛm no yiye koraa.
Nobody cares about that.	Obiara mfa saa asɛm no ho.
It’s still dangerous.	Ɛda so ara yɛ asiane.
True, but not entirely true.	Ɛyɛ nokware, nanso ɛnyɛ nokware koraa.
Alright.	Ɛyɛ.
He loved being with us.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔne yɛn bɛka ho.
With this book.	Ne nhoma yi.
Maybe it’s too much.	Ebia ɛdɔɔso dodo.
My mother never knew what to do with me.	Me maame anhu nea ɔbɛyɛ me da.
You remembered me.	Wokae me.
Which is what we do.	Nea ɛyɛ nea yɛyɛ.
This is my group.	Eyi ne me kuw.
The work is great for him.	Adwuma no yɛ kɛse ma no.
That’s part of that, too.	Ɛno nso yɛ saa asɛm no fã.
He was never honest.	Ná onni nokware da.
Interesting, good pictures, good story.	Anigye, mfonini pa, asɛm pa.
It looked like it had to be someone else.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ obi foforo.
, not me.	, ɛnyɛ me.
I thought you were too easy on all of them.	Misusuwii sɛ wo ho yɛ mmerɛw dodo wɔ wɔn nyinaa ho.
They were very skilled.	Na wɔn ho akokwaw paa.
Give us feedback.	Ma yɛn nsɛm a wobɛka.
He pointed out the window.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
It just seemed too obvious.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛda adi dodo ara kwa.
This will always be you.	Eyi bɛyɛ wo bere nyinaa.
Our team is playing well.	Yɛn kuw no rebɔ yiye.
Nevertheless, his words are true.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ne nsɛm no yɛ nokware.
The car sped off in its direction.	Kar no de mmirika kɔɔ baabi a ɛrekɔ no.
That in itself is an interesting story.	Ɛno ankasa yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
Not nearly as big as he should be.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ kɛse sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no.
Not the car.	Ɛnyɛ kar no.
I know how this movie ends.	Minim sɛnea sini yi ba awiei.
Which is beautiful.	Nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
It’s still going on.	Ɛda so ara kɔ so.
I was in my bedroom.	Ná mewɔ me mpa so.
Keep playing the game.	Kɔ so di agoru.
This is no longer such a reality today.	Eyi nyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nokware saa bio nnɛ.
I wanted him so much.	Ná mepɛ no kɛse.
Everything happens so fast here.	Biribiara kɔ so ntɛmntɛm saa wɔ ha.
It’s not a sin.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne.
You should be happy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye.
Most of them work.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara yɛ adwuma.
One final note.	Nsɛm biako a etwa to.
Too good, most likely.	Eye dodo, ɛda adi kɛse sɛ.
It was a good enough plan.	Ná ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe pa a ɛdɔɔso.
I am very strong and independent.	Me ho yɛ den yiye na mede me ho.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
So stay tuned.	Enti tra ase.
And they told us.	Na wɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn.
That kept me focused.	Ɛno maa m’adwene kɔɔ so.
She wants a boy to play with.	Ɔpɛ abarimaa bi a ɔne no bedi agoru.
I do that for a couple of reasons.	Nneɛma abien bi nti na meyɛ saa.
They glanced at each other.	Wɔde wɔn ani kyerɛɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
He uses money to make things work.	Ɔde sika di dwuma de ma nneɛma kɔ so yiye.
I want to tell his mother that too.	Mepɛ sɛ meka saa asɛm no nso kyerɛ ne maame.
See below for more.	Hwɛ ase hɔ.
This is simply not true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware kɛkɛ.
And children are even more so.	Na mmofra nso sen saa mpo.
He's just better than me today.	Ɔyɛ papa sen me nnɛ ara kwa.
What was his name .	Ná ne din de dɛn .
That’s for another time.	Ɛno yɛ bere foforo de.
His legs worked.	Ne nan yɛɛ adwuma.
I was there the next day.	Ná mewɔ hɔ da a edi hɔ no.
Did these people really exist?	So na saa nkurɔfo yi wɔ hɔ ampa?
That’s the plan.	Ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no.
His mind was completely empty.	Ná n’adwene yɛ nea hwee nni mu koraa.
Everyone in any.	Obiara a ɔwɔ biara mu.
Moreover, there was something about him.	Bio nso, na biribi wɔ ne ho.
Do the background first.	Di kan yɛ akyi no.
It would actually be quite easy for most characters.	Ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa ankasa ama nnipa dodow no ara a wɔka ho asɛm no.
And yet that’s not the end of the story.	Na nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no awiei.
I felt that every day.	Ná mete nka saa da biara da.
He has nothing to do with this.	Ɔne eyi nni hwee yɛ.
Things had taken longer than he would have liked.	Ná nneɛma agye bere tenten sen sɛnea anka n’ani begye ho.
I actually have one.	Mewɔ bi ankasa.
This was an expensive meal.	Ná eyi yɛ aduan a ne bo yɛ den.
You’ll do the same.	Wo nso wobɛyɛ saa.
We have to trust the story.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde yɛn ho to asɛm no so.
But they do work.	Nanso wɔyɛ adwuma.
However, he was very good at it.	Nanso, na ne ho akokwaw yiye wɔ mu.
I think the hair looks pretty good too.	Misusuw sɛ ti nhwi no nso hwɛ yiye yiye.
I have done a lot of walking.	Mayɛ nantew pii.
I didn’t have a team.	Ná minni kuw biara.
None of that is as simple as it may seem.	Ɛno mu biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ebia ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛte no.
If you have anything to say, tell me.	Sɛ wowɔ asɛm bi ka a, ka kyerɛ me.
I doubt many people have.	Migye kyim sɛ nnipa pii ayɛ saa.
Or it was, recently.	Anaasɛ na ɛte saa, nnansa yi ara.
I am your wife.	Me ne wo yere.
Maybe, just maybe.	Ebia, ebia kɛkɛ.
You have to make that movie.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa sini no.
The big point is to put it in simple terms.	Asɛm kɛse no ne sɛ wode nsɛm a ɛnyɛ den bɛka ho asɛm.
The offense must still be solid.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mfomso no da so ara yɛ den.
It’s really that.	Ɛte saa ankasa.
It’s not a new story.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm foforo.
It’s really something.	Ɛyɛ ade bi ankasa.
That’s their point anyway.	Ɛno ne wɔn asɛm no ɔkwan biara so.
About the time.	Wɔ bere no ho.
He works for me.	Ɔyɛ adwuma ma me.
Not all of it, at least.	Ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
We all have to feel pain.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa te yaw.
He knew the story.	Ná onim asɛm.
Nobody, nobody uses me.	Obiara, obiara mfa me nni dwuma.
My father was awake that evening.	Ná me papa ani da hɔ saa anwummere no.
No one hears about them.	Obiara nte wɔn ho asɛm.
I see that in many people today.	Mihu saa wɔ nnipa pii ho nnɛ.
He's lucky, man.	Ɔwɔ anigye, ɔbarima.
I have school and stuff.	Mewɔ sukuu ne nneɛma.
I shouldn’t have said that.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meka saa.
I love the song.	M’ani gye dwom no ho.
I am sure many of you have been there.	Migye di sɛ mo mu pii akɔ hɔ.
Do not approach the vehicle.	Mfa kar no ho nkɔ.
But not immediately.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ntɛm ara.
I work in one.	Meyɛ adwuma wɔ biako mu.
It wasn’t a disaster.	Ná ɛnyɛ asiane.
And you’re absolutely right.	Na woayɛ no yiye koraa.
I can never see that.	Mintumi nhu saa da.
I don’t know if he was honest.	Minnim sɛ ebia na odi nokware anaa.
So he did, too.	Enti ɔno nso.
Maybe he was a man.	Ebia na ɔyɛ ɔbarima.
So tell me this.	Enti ka eyi kyerɛ me.
It is still possible.	Ɛda so ara betumi aba.
I don’t think any of them needed to.	Minsusuw sɛ na ɛho hia sɛ wɔn mu biara yɛ saa.
That should be easy to do.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobɛyɛ.
Make sure this is the case.	Hwɛ hu sɛ eyi te saa.
One foot in front of the next.	Nan biako wɔ nea edi hɔ no anim.
We had their shoes.	Ná yɛwɔ wɔn mpaboa.
That would be amazing.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nwonwa.
His plan worked well.	Ne nhyehyɛe no yɛɛ adwuma yiye.
It’s a very difficult situation.	Ɛyɛ tebea a ɛyɛ den yiye.
Surprisingly, there are no accidents.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa no, akwanhyia biara nni hɔ.
This lack of sleep is doing strange things to my head.	Saa nna a minni yi reyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ me ti so.
You can get it right now if you want it.	Wubetumi anya no mprempren ara sɛ wopɛ no a.
That will be the last one.	Ɛno na ɛbɛyɛ nea etwa to.
He is not real, he does not exist.	Ɔnyɛ obi ankasa, onni hɔ.
If something happened to them, that was it.	Sɛ biribi to wɔn a, na ɛno ara ne no.
He did it for her.	Ɔyɛɛ maa no.
Which is quite simple.	Nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
Rely on two animals.	Fa wo ho to mmoa abien so.
He didn't want to worry.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔhaw ne ho.
I wanted him to start school on his own.	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa fi sukuu ase.
This thing is not sustainable.     	Saa ade yi ntumi nkɔ so.

Everyone saw him.	Obiara huu no.
This has never been a problem for us.	Eyi nyɛ ɔhaw mma yɛn da.
The people just stare.	Nkurɔfo no hwɛ wɔn anim kɛkɛ.
Watch it for this.	Hwɛ no eyi nti.
It is usually very busy.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛyɛ nea adagyew nnim koraa.
And, we are here to provide services the way you want.	Na, yɛwɔ ha sɛ yɛde nnwuma bɛma wo ɔkwan a wopɛ so.
I don't know what to do about it at all.	Minnim nea mɛyɛ wɔ ho koraa.
When it’s hot, it’s hot.	Sɛ ɛyɛ hyew a, ɛyɛ hyew.
Or not much this time.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ pii saa bere yi.
A man was shocked.	Ɔbarima bi ho dwiriw no.
To that perhaps.	To sɛ ebia.
Existing work is new.	Adwuma a ɛwɔ hɔ dedaw no yɛ ade foforo.
I had no idea how to actually say anything.	Ná minnim sɛnea mɛka biribi ankasa ho adwene biara.
All of those things are true.	Saa nneɛma no nyinaa yɛ nokware.
He thinks he is perfect.	Osusuw sɛ ɔyɛ pɛ.
I would say that is the best.	Meka sɛ ɛno na eye sen biara.
Evil is good.	Bɔne yɛ papa.
This diet was supposed to make you bigger and stronger.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ saa aduan yi ma woyɛ kɛse na wo ho yɛ den.
That’s a lot of work.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma pii.
He even brought my luggage to my car for me.	Ɔde me nneɛma mpo baa me kar mu maa me.
He was a child, too.	Ná ɔno nso yɛ abofra.
And that kid, too.	Na saa abofra no nso.
My name is not there.	Me din nni hɔ.
Besides, he's not dangerous.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɔnyɛ asiane biara.
I hope you get this soon.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo nsa bɛka eyi nnansa yi ara.
You were there for most of it.	Na wowɔ hɔ wɔ ne fã kɛse no ara mu.
His life is in danger.	Ne nkwa da asiane mu.
However, it’s a really bad job.	Nanso, ɛyɛ adwuma bɔne ankasa.
So we could move on now.	Enti na yebetumi akɔ so mprempren.
Such a good movie!!.	Sini pa a ɛte saa!!.
You need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
I can give you clothes.	Metumi ama wo ntade.
However, it is not necessary.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia.
There needs to be more to this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ pii ka eyi ho.
I know how it feels.	Minim sɛnea ɛte nka.
I didn’t know what else to do.	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ bio.
A long time ago.	Bere tenten a atwam ni.
It’s crazy.	Ɛyɛ kraman.
At least for him.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ ne fam no.
He must have known.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na onim.
It was a very powerful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a tumi wom yiye.
I just really enjoyed it.	M’ani gyee ho ankasa ara kwa.
And it’s definitely not about sex.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ nna ho asɛm.
They are so wonderful.	Wɔyɛ nwonwa yiye.
That’s the way the story is.	Saa na asɛm no te.
Hope your day is going well.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wo da no rekɔ yiye.
That bus is really a threat to the city.	Saa bɔs no yɛ asiane ma kurow no ankasa.
You need to spend some time thinking.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode bere kakra susuw nneɛma ho.
But it’s too easy to actually do it.	Nanso ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo sɛ wobɛyɛ no ankasa.
The money fell to the ground.	Sika no hwee fam.
They enjoy what they do.	Wɔn ani gye nea wɔyɛ ho.
It’s a beautiful day today, isn’t it?	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ fɛ nnɛ, ɛnte saa?
I saw him doing that.	Mihuu no sɛ ɔreyɛ saa.
Careful planning is essential.	Nhyehyɛe a wɔyɛ no yiye ho hia.
His father was the only one left.	Ná ne papa nkutoo ne nea aka.
So, that’s it.	Enti, saa.
He was in school.	Ná ɔwɔ sukuu mu.
She slipped her hand off one of her shoes and dropped it.	Ɔde ne nsa fii ne mpaboa biako so na ɔde ne nsa too fam.
Does anyone remember this?.	So obi kae eyi?.
And that’s why the movie didn’t work.	Na ɛno nti na sini no anyɛ adwuma no.
He was alone in the room.	Ná ɔno nkutoo wɔ dan no mu.
Which works well.	Nea ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
There had to be a reason for the plan.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe no.
When he told me, I couldn’t believe it.	Bere a ɔka kyerɛɛ me no, na mintumi nnye nni.
The same is true of my head.	Saa ara na me ti nso te.
It should be about now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bɛyɛ mprempren.
His hand began to ache.	Ne nsa fii ase yɛɛ no ​​yaw.
There were many varieties.	Ná ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
I’d be more than happy.	M’ani begye ho kɛse.
Play this song again.	Bɔ saa dwom yi bio.
Still, it was the best.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
You put him on me.	Wode no bɔɔ me ho.
I still believe in him, as does the team.	Meda so ara gye no di, sɛnea kuw no nso gye di no.
I don’t think it’s a policy.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe a wɔde yɛ saa.
Three days from now.	Nnansa fi saa bere yi.
I hear what you say.	Mete nea woka no.
Some of that is going on.	Ɛno bi rekɔ so.
There wasn’t much else he could do from here.	Na nneɛma foforo pii nni hɔ a obetumi afi ha ayɛ.
It was my move.	Ná ɛyɛ me tu.
I know how dangerous that was for you.	Minim sɛnea na ɛno yɛ asiane kɛse ma wo.
It’s really easy.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
Without water there is no life	Sɛ nsu nni hɔ a, nkwa nni hɔ
I think it is way below the price.	Misusuw sɛ ɛwɔ fam koraa wɔ bo no ho.
I see two reasons.	Mihu nneɛma abien nti.
That’s really exciting.	Ɛno yɛ anigye ankasa.
I love that it's hot!.	M'ani gye ho sɛ ɛyɛ hyew!.
Just those two things.	Saa nneɛma abien no ara kwa.
Not popular enough.	Ɛnyɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I have it in now.	Mewɔ bi wɔ mu mprempren.
No one wants this.	Obiara mpɛ eyi.
In terms of resources.	Wɔ nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma ho no.
I think that means something.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno kyerɛ biribi.
We shouldn’t have done that.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
He reached for his gun.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne tuo no.
I knew he would.	Ná minim sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
They had their eyes on me.	Ná wɔn ani da me so.
Mind is not so trivial.	Adwene nyɛ nea ɛho nhia saa.
I really couldn’t work it out.	Ankasa na mintumi nyɛ ho adwuma.
But that’s just the point.	Nanso ɛno ara ne asɛm no.
And take that issue.	Na fa saa asɛm no.
There was someone else in the house.	Ná obi foforo wɔ fie hɔ.
In any case, it was a lie.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na ɛyɛ atoro.
Many people do it.	Nnipa pii na wɔyɛ.
Put your hands on your head.	Fa wo nsa to wo ti so.
Late last year.	Afe a etwaam no awiei.
The car runs great.	Kar no tu mmirika yiye.
Nothing works here.	Biribiara nyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
And yet it was his intention to bring them here.	Na nanso na ɛyɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔde wɔn bɛba ha.
You just never know.	Wunnim da kɛkɛ.
I keep wondering if it really matters.	Mekɔ so susuw ho sɛ ebia ɛho hia ankasa anaa.
The game was almost over.	Ná ɛkame ayɛ sɛ agoru no aba awiei.
He volunteers his time.	Ɔde ne bere tu ne ho ma.
The story got a lot of attention.	Asɛm no nyaa adwene kɛse.
There is no time for doubt.	Bere nni hɔ a wɔde begye akyinnye.
The head is too hot.	Ti no yɛ hyew dodo.
Eventually, the game will be great.	Awiei koraa no, agoru no bɛyɛ kɛse.
I have put it together here.	Mede abɔ mu wɔ ha.
But nothing else needed to be said.	Nanso na ɛho nhia sɛ wɔka biribi foforo biara.
Look at us.	Hwɛ yɛn.
The next step is simple.	Ade a edi hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no yɛ mmerɛw.
Generally, any language will do just fine.	Mpɛn pii no, kasa biara bɛyɛ yiye.
This makes it important that the dress is not too revealing.	Eyi ma ɛho hia sɛ atade no nyɛ nea ɛda adi dodo.
So many seem to make the same mistakes again.	Enti ɛte sɛ nea pii san di mfomso koro no ara.
Many people saw us.	Nnipa pii huu yɛn.
I had to tell them about it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka ho asɛm kyerɛ wɔn.
Look only at what you want to do, and nothing else.	Hwɛ nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ no nkutoo, na ɛnyɛ biribi foforo biara.
Bicycles are definitely a bad idea.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ sakre yɛ adwene bɔne.
It is quite simple and beautiful.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa na ɛyɛ fɛ.
That’s what they play with day and night.	Ɛno ne nea wɔde di agoru awia ne anadwo.
Lots of traffic in the morning.	Kar pii kɔ hɔ anɔpa.
I have a big problem with this guy.	Me ne saa ɔbarima yi wɔ ɔhaw kɛse bi.
And that means something.	Na ɛno kyerɛ biribi.
Many people find that exciting.	Nnipa pii hu sɛ ɛno yɛ anigye.
The meeting is very crowded.	Nhyiam no ayɛ ma kɛse.
He’s very excited.	N’ani agye yiye.
He is a person who.	Ɔyɛ obi a.
Stay on the same side of the road.	Kɔ so tra ɔkwan no fã koro no ara.
There was something behind it all that he was always jealous of.	Na biribi wɔ ne nyinaa akyi a na n’ani bere nyinaa.
Many people work outside in the city.	Nnipa pii yɛ adwuma wɔ abɔnten wɔ kurow no mu.
I look around the room.	Mehwɛ dan no mu nyinaa.
Things had gone well for them.	Ná nneɛma akɔ so yiye ama wɔn.
Which is just important.	A ɛho hia ara kwa.
Maybe there is no end.	Ebia awiei biara nni hɔ.
That was wise.	Ná ɛno yɛ nyansa.
I really enjoyed it very much.	M’ani gyee ho yiye ankasa.
That just seemed weird.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
Thank you, everyone.	Meda mo ase, obiara.
The water was very warm that day.	Ná nsu no mu yɛ hyew kɛse saa da no.
Or let them do any work.	Anaasɛ ma wɔyɛ adwuma biara.
A lot of money went into the project.	Sika pii kɔɔ adwuma no mu.
I wanted no part of them.	Ná mempɛ wɔn fã biara.
Being with him is a pleasure.	Sɛ wo ne no bɛbɔ a, ɛyɛ anigye.
I can’t play with anyone else.	Mintumi ne obi foforo biara nni agoru.
That’s right, that’s all the work you have to do.	Ɛte saa, ɛno ara ne adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
It wasn’t really as bad as it sounded.	Na ɛnyɛ bɔne ankasa sɛnea na ɛte no.
I just trusted you.	Mede me ho too wo mu ara kwa.
That might be a good thing to get involved with.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ ade pa a ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu.
What a difficult decision!	Gyinae a ɛyɛ den bɛn ara ni!
He was sitting on a bed.	Ná ɔte mpa bi so.
Another mistake!	Mfomso bio!
It was an amazing thing to be a part of.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ wobɛyɛ ne fã.
The most beautiful pictures.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ sen biara.
It was very painful.	Ná ɛyɛ yaw paa.
Like everyone else.	Te sɛ obiara.
It has been truly amazing.	Ayɛ nwonwa ankasa.
There may be another problem.	Ebia ɔhaw foforo bi wɔ hɔ.
But very well.	Nanso yiye paa.
The latter is what many people don’t know.	Nea etwa to no ne nea nnipa pii nnim.
There were no other things like it.	Ná nneɛma foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ ɛno.
Many of my friends live there.	Me nnamfo pii te hɔ.
It’s nicer down there.	Ɛyɛ fɛ sen saa wɔ fam hɔ.
My legs hurt.	Me nan ase yɛɛ me yaw.
And he tells her how it is.	Na ɔka kyerɛ no sɛnea ɛte.
But it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛnte saa.
No one could tell.	Obiara antumi anka.
There had to be a way.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan bi wɔ hɔ.
This work is important for many reasons.	Nneɛma pii nti na saa adwuma yi ho hia.
I think this is the most important thing.	Misusuw sɛ eyi ne ade a ɛho hia sen biara.
Some of their music still sounds really fresh.	Wɔn nnwom no bi da so ara te sɛ nea ɛyɛ foforo ankasa.
No one is perfect.	Obiara nyɛ pɛ.
But they work well.	Nanso wɔyɛ adwuma yiye.
You have to do the work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma no.
How much is this?	Eyi yɛ ahe?
That morning.	Saa anɔpa no.
Now I have one.	Seesei mewɔ bi.
Be good in every way.	Yɛ papa ɔkwan biara so.
It was as if.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea.
We have the power.	Yɛwɔ tumi no.
It shouldn’t be that hard.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den saa.
It is not that much more expensive.	Ɛnyɛ nea ne bo yɛ den saa kɛse.
The party didn’t go well.	Apontow no ankɔ yiye.
Develop a plan of action.	Yɛ nhyehyɛe a wode bɛyɛ ade.
He did such a good job.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma pa a ɛte saa.
Thus, the reputation of the manufacturer is high.	Enti, nea ɔyɛ nneɛma no din pa yɛ kɛse.
He likes it and he likes the way it looks.	N’ani gye ho na n’ani gye sɛnea ɛte no ho.
He is really happy there.	Ɔwɔ anigye ankasa wɔ hɔ.
Check it out daily if you must.	Hwɛ no da biara sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa a.
Here are some of mine.	Me de no bi ni.
But it’s not just sex.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nna nkutoo na ɛyɛ.
This bed has room for me.	Saa mpa yi wɔ baabi ma me.
It is a thing of our time.	Ɛyɛ yɛn bere yi mu ade.
Most happened in the first two years.	Dodow no ara sii wɔ mfe abien a edi kan no mu.
Whatever it was, really put it down.	Nea na ɛyɛ biara no, fa no to fam ankasa.
I think it was just me.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
I don’t think one is easier than the other.	Minsusuw sɛ biako yɛ mmerɛw sen foforo.
The picture is interesting and interesting.	Mfonini no yɛ anigye na ɛyɛ anigye.
I was pretty full on those days.	Ná me ho ayɛ me ma yiye wɔ saa nna no mu.
We would have, too, otherwise.	Anka yɛn nso yɛbɛyɛ saa, sɛ ɛnte saa a.
If it were me, school would come first.	Sɛ ɛyɛ me a, anka sukuu bedi kan.
Remember me here.	Kae me ho wɔ ha.
That he is the unfaithful one.	Sɛ ɔno ne nea onni nokware no.
I think this is kind of like that.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ ɔkwan bi a ɛte saa.
So many people need help and support.	Enti nnipa pii hia mmoa ne mmoa.
I didn’t know what to do with my hands.	Ná minnim nea mede me nsa bɛyɛ.
And that was three days ago.	Na ɛno yɛ nnansa a atwam ni.
The first of the year.	Afe no mu nea edi kan.
Apparently, it has already been used very little.	Ɛda adi sɛ wɔde adi dwuma dedaw kakraa bi pɛ.
This takes some time.	Eyi gye bere kakra.
But he was as into it as the rest.	Nanso na ɔde ne ho ahyɛ mu te sɛ wɔn a aka no.
I don’t think most of us would.	Minsusuw sɛ yɛn mu dodow no ara bɛyɛ saa.
But it’s not too important.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia dodo.
This is a good party.	Eyi yɛ apontow pa.
Most people said it was dangerous.	Nnipa dodow no ara kae sɛ ɛyɛ asiane.
You can do this at least several times.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wubetumi ayɛ eyi mpɛn pii.
Something would happen now.	Ná biribi bɛba mprempren.
You have to be perfect.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ pɛ.
The time to be interested is when no one else is.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye ho ne bere a obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
He.	Ɔno.
We just don’t forget things.	Yɛn werɛ mfi nneɛma bi kɛkɛ.
Take your time, but act quickly.	Gye wo bere, nanso yɛ ho biribi ntɛm.
However, this doesn’t work.	Nanso, eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
That’s how it seems to be.	Saa na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte.
That’s a long time.	Ɛno yɛ bere tenten.
If not, that’s a real problem.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛno yɛ ɔhaw ankasa.
Sit with them at lunch.	Wo ne wɔn tra awia aduan ase.
However, there is no food.	Nanso, aduan biara nni hɔ.
She is our mother.	Ɔno ne yɛn maame.
Our own is included.	Yɛn ankasa de ka ho.
I have more at stake here than you do.	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛwɔ asiane mu wɔ ha sen wo.
But it was only three days ago.	Nanso na ɛyɛ nnansa pɛ a atwam ni.
They know it themselves.	Wɔn ankasa nim.
He wanted to do this himself.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa yɛ eyi.
And in several days.	Na wɔ nna pii mu.
The dress is not very nice.	Atade no nyɛ fɛ yiye.
At his feet.	Wɔ ne nan ho.
Music has to deal with time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nnwom di bere ho dwuma.
A really interesting idea.	Adwene a ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
His works have a reputation for authenticity.	Ne nnwuma no agye din sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
I really want that.	Mepɛ saa ampa.
Let someone else handle it.	Ma obi foforo nni ho dwuma.
But this was my home.	Nanso na eyi ne me fie.
I think I get the point, though.	Nanso, misusuw sɛ mete asɛm no ase.
I never knew about them.	Ná minnim wɔn ho asɛm da.
It didn't sound any better than the last time.	Ná ɛnte sɛ nea eye sen bere a etwa to no.
You and your children.	Wo ne wo mma.
The party enjoyed very popular support	Apontow no nyaa mmoa a nnipa pii ani gye ho kɛse
Next add all the water.	Nea edi hɔ no, fa nsu no nyinaa ka ho.
And you’ve done it right.	Na woayɛ no yiye.
He wanted to drive.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka kar.
That is why we renew ourselves.	Ɛno nti na yɛyɛ yɛn ho foforo no.
So many kids here.	Enti mmofra pii wɔ ha.
He ate lunch alone.	Ɔno nkutoo dii awia aduan.
A bright man he is.	Ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ hyew na ɔyɛ.
That’s why it’s there.	Ɛno nti na ɛwɔ hɔ no.
I shouldn’t be doing this.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi.
He was excited.	Ná n’ani agye.
You could say they were.	Wubetumi aka sɛ na wɔyɛ saa.
You don’t like it either.	Wo nso w’ani nnye ho.
Therefore, .	Enti, .
I hope it's still full.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛda so ara yɛ ma.
These displays are simple.	Saa nneɛma a wɔde kyerɛ yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
That was the wise thing to do.	Na ɛno yɛ ade a nyansa wom a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
However, I couldn’t do that.	Nanso, na mintumi nyɛ saa.
Consider something else.	Susuw biribi foforo ho hwɛ.
Or you can install it.	Anaasɛ wubetumi de ahyɛ mu.
His was the absolute control.	Ná ne de no ne nea odi so koraa.
I hope it doesn’t.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
But there is plenty of food.	Nanso aduan pii wɔ hɔ.
Think of it as the first night.	Fa no sɛ anadwo a edi kan.
Something you’re doing.	Biribi a woreyɛ.
That person was me.	Ná saa onipa no ne me.
And if something goes wrong.	Na sɛ biribi ankɔ yiye a.
Tell him in bed.	Ka kyerɛ no wɔ mpa so.
I have to be careful with these things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ me ho yiye wɔ saa nneɛma yi ho.
This sounds like a good opportunity.	Eyi te sɛ hokwan pa.
That's over with.	Ɛno aba awiei ne.
He was independent.	Ná ɔde ne ho.
It’s just us.	Ɛyɛ yɛn nkutoo.
We are not important enough.	Yɛn ho nhia sɛnea ɛsɛ.
That’s what every man does.	Saa ara na ɔbarima biara yɛ.
None of us have dinner.	Yɛn mu biara nni anwummere aduan.
He knew what he wanted to say.	Ná onim nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka.
That makes things easier.	Ɛno ma nneɛma yɛ mmerɛw.
So we’re pretty excited about it.	Enti yɛn ani agye yiye wɔ ho.
And me being a beautiful person.	Na me a meyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Say something about it.	Ka asɛm bi.
Tell them why.	Ka nea enti a ɛte saa kyerɛ wɔn.
It was true in a way.	Ná ɛyɛ nokware wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
Make them better.	Ma wɔn nyɛ papa.
There were many jobs.	Ná nnwuma pii wɔ hɔ.
So it must have been very painful.	Enti ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ yaw kɛse.
Why the child meant so much.	Nea enti a na abofra no kyerɛ pii saa.
I felt like I had used it.	Metee nka sɛ mede adi dwuma.
I nodded my head.	Mede me ti too fam.
Not for the first time.	Ɛnyɛ nea edi kan koraa.
Look, there’s my son.	Hwɛ, me ba no wɔ hɔ.
I have only one hope.	Anidaso biako pɛ na mewɔ.
It had been a rough go for him.	Na ayɛ kɔ a ɛyɛ den ama no.
Money language.	Sika kasa.
While supply remains stable.	Bere a nneɛma a wɔde ma no kɔ so tra hɔ no.
That’s just not the case.	Ɛno ara ne sɛ ɛnte saa.
But it would have been so easy.	Nanso anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
I certainly don’t want to be that guy.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa ɔbarima no.
So was everyone else.	Saa ara na na obiara a aka no nso te.
It wasn’t hard for him.	Ná ɛnyɛ den mma no.
That’s right, that’s what.	Ɛte saa, ɛno ne nea.
The nature of the mind.	Adwene no su.
I had to look into it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu.
Does he even know about it.	So onim ho asɛm mpo.
We are definitely stronger than that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ yɛyɛ den sen saa.
They give him whatever he needs.	Wɔde nea ɛho hia biara ma no.
After that, the going will be easy.	Ɛno akyi no, kɔ no bɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Everyone is getting into it.	Obiara rekɔ mu.
It’s pretty simple, really.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye, ampa.
His eyes went elsewhere.	N’ani kɔɔ baabi foforo.
That it will be a long time.	Sɛ ɛbɛyɛ bere tenten.
Any other time we would.	Bere foforo biara anka yɛbɛyɛ saa.
I could go on and on.	Ná metumi akɔ so.
I don't feel bad about it.	Ɛnyɛ me yaw wɔ ho.
I am still in control.	Meda so ara di so.
This song is about being who you want to be.	Saa dwom yi fa sɛnea wobɛyɛ nea wopɛ ho.
Just like we do, too.	Sɛnea yɛn nso yɛyɛ no.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
I work at home.	Meyɛ adwuma wɔ fie.
The interesting thing is.	Nea ɛyɛ anigye no.
It’s my first day at work.	Ɛyɛ me da a edi kan wɔ adwumam.
Even so, he nodded.	Ɛno mpo no, ɔde ne ti too fam.
Everyone seems to know this movie.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara nim sini yi.
I don’t want any trouble.	Mempɛ ɔhaw biara.
I will never forget it.	Me werɛ mfi da.
That, first of all.	Ɛno, nea edi kan no.
Sexual matters.	Nna ho nsɛm.
But it’s not just sex.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nna nkutoo.
It still works.	Ɛda so ara yɛ adwuma.
I wanted that to work so badly.	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ adwuma bɔne saa.
He has invested time and money in this project.	Ɔde bere ne sika ayɛ adwuma yi.
One is never free from the past.	Obi mfa ne ho mfi nea atwam no ho da.
And a lot of work went into this.	Na adwuma pii kɔɔ eyi mu.
Maybe someone else should try and talk to him.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ obi foforo bɔ mmɔden na ɔne no kasa.
Just look down.	Hwɛ fam kɛkɛ.
Nothing should have been said.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔka biribiara.
He must have been.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɔte saa.
As long as he liked her he was very happy.	Bere tenten a na n’ani gye ne ho no na n’ani agye yiye.
Just be someone else.	Yɛ obi foforo kɛkɛ.
But he will be fine.	Nanso ne ho bɛtɔ no yiye.
But it doesn’t have to be in my house.	Nanso enhia sɛ ɛwɔ me fie.
That’s a fact.	Ɛno yɛ nokware.
But the trend is not strongly evident.	Nanso su no nna adi denneennen.
Remove and check again.	Yi na san hwɛ bio.
It was a very nice stay.	Na ɛyɛ tra a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
The danger part is real.	Asiane no fã no yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
I have my way.	Mewɔ me kwan.
As was he, too.	Sɛnea na ɔno nso te no.
This was not easy for any of us.	Ná eyi nyɛ mmerɛw mma yɛn mu biara.
We do this work every day.	Yɛyɛ saa adwuma yi da biara da.
I love that she just wants to work.	M’ani gye ho sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
The day was the same day.	Ná da no yɛ da koro no ara.
We can only move forward.	Yebetumi akɔ yɛn anim nkutoo.
After those first two shots, it was always empty.	Wɔ saa tuo abien a edi kan no akyi no, na hwee nni mu bere nyinaa.
You work on what you want.	Woyɛ nea wopɛ ho adwuma.
He liked the dog.	N’ani gyee ɔkraman no ho.
And so on and so forth.	Na nea ɛte saa nso.
Whatever it is, it will be.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ biara, ɛbɛyɛ.
There is actually a lot of information to work with.	Nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde yɛ adwuma ankasa.
A house is a house.	Ofie yɛ ofie.
Even if it is the best.	Sɛ ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara mpo a.
It’s best to do without.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ a ɛnyɛ saa.
Nothing was a problem on the eve of our big day.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na ɛyɛ ɔhaw wɔ yɛn da kɛse no anim.
He seemed very weak.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Everyone says this.	Obiara ka eyi.
Cinematic presentation of it all.	Sini mu a wɔde kyerɛ ne nyinaa.
Do you see that boy?	So wuhu saa abarimaa no?
That is very true.	Ɛno yɛ nokware paa.
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It’s not good to do that.	Ɛnyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
The car crashed.	Kar no hwee ase.
I have been over the problem for a long time.	Mayɛ ɔhaw no so bere tenten ni.
I know enough.	Minim nea ɛdɔɔso.
This idea is very interesting.	Saa adwene yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
Maybe its the whole week.	Ebia ne dapɛn mũ no nyinaa.
I feel so lucky to be here.	Mete nka sɛ mewɔ anigye kɛse sɛ mewɔ ha.
Do everything right.	Yɛ biribiara yiye.
He smirked at himself.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ ne ho so.
Usually days after the incident.	Mpɛn pii no, asɛm no akyi nna bi.
And so we are here.	Na enti yɛwɔ ha.
That would be amazing.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nwonwa.
This is absolutely fascinating.	Eyi yɛ anigye koraa.
We need to do this really well.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ eyi yiye ankasa.
One day was like another entirely.	Ná da koro bi te sɛ da foforo koraa.
He was in his room, but he locked it.	Ná ɔwɔ ne dan mu, nanso ɔde too mu.
Not to take them away.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn bɛkɔ.
And I’m doing you a favor.	Na meyɛ wo yiye.
Anything and everything was still possible.	Ná biribiara ne biribiara da so ara betumi ayɛ yiye.
He just doesn’t like it right now.	Ɔno kɛkɛ a n’ani nnye ho mprempren.
I'm still afraid.	Meda so ara suro.
It was some water police.	Ná ɛyɛ nsu ho polisifo bi.
It was a very good day.	Ná ɛyɛ da pa ara.
For most, probably not.	Wɔ dodow no ara fam no, ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
That was pretty awesome too.	Ná ɛno nso yɛ hu yiye.
What you do when you practice matters.	Nea woyɛ bere a woreyɛ adesua no ho hia.
I did a lot of work here for him.	Meyɛɛ adwuma pii wɔ ha maa no.
It definitely had my attention.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛwɔ m’adwene.
But something else is going on here.	Nanso biribi foforo rekɔ so wɔ ha.
The party was full of surprises.	Ná nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa ahyɛ apontow no mu ma.
It’s very, very nice.	Ɛyɛ paa, paa.
There are many things involved.	Nneɛma pii wɔ mu.
In the long run.	Wɔ bere tenten mu no.
This is what they do.	Eyi na wɔyɛ.
At least he thought he would.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na osusuw sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
He is really into this movie.	Ɔde ne ho ahyɛ sini yi mu ankasa.
It’s like that some days.	Ɛte saa nna bi.
I think it’s hot.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ hyew.
Beautiful, but also terrifying.	Ɛyɛ fɛ, nanso ɛyɛ hu nso.
However, you see that	Nanso, wuhu sɛ .
When it is cold, animals hibernate.	Sɛ awɔw wom a, mmoa da awɔw bere mu.
It’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
You tell yourself.	Woka kyerɛ wo ho.
He just loved to play.	Ná n’ani gye agoru ara kwa.
Nothing much going on.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛrekɔ so kɛse.
However, that’s pretty much the only thing that shows it.	Nanso, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno nkutoo ne ade a ɛda no adi.
There is a lot of life in the room.	Nkwa pii wɔ dan no mu.
I like that one too.	M’ani gye saa biako no nso ho.
But it’s a great job.	Nanso ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
And the kids.	Ne mmofra no.
I don't have one of those.	Minni saa nneɛma no mu biako.
In the past, many people have.	Bere a atwam no, nnipa pii wɔ.
That’s the problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
It’s simple but really fresh.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw nanso ɛyɛ foforo ankasa.
They do something else.	Wɔyɛ biribi foforo.
Something you need to know.	Biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
This is the perfect job for me.	Eyi ne adwuma a edi mũ ma me.
He will be playing himself.	Ɔno ankasa bɛyɛ agoru.
You have to think about it carefully.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho yiye.
My roommate moved out.	Nea me ne no te dan mu no tu fii adi.
But it was, in part.	Nanso na ɛte saa, ne fã bi.
The man was just as lying.	Ná ɔbarima no nso da atoro saa ara.
He knew her when.	Ná onim no bere a.
I have another one, too.	Mewɔ foforo nso.
Quite busy indeed.	Adagyew koraa ampa.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I had done a terrible thing.	Ná mayɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu.
Which is almost beautiful.	Nea ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ.
We have life, fullness of life.	Yɛwɔ nkwa, nkwa a ɛyɛ ma.
The going seemed to work out.	Ɛte sɛ nea kɔ no yɛɛ yiye.
He looked so young.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
You wanted to be with them.	Ná wopɛ sɛ woka wɔn ho.
A good thing works great.	Ade pa yɛ adwuma kɛse.
The year began like any other.	Afe no fii ase te sɛ afe foforo biara.
He was never there when it mattered.	Ná onni hɔ da bere a na ɛho hia no.
They’re bright.	Wɔn ani bɔ.
But he also did this in a beautiful way.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ eyi nso wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ fɛ so.
He had me.	Ná ɔwɔ me.
It is not a product.	Ɛnyɛ ade a wɔde yɛ ade.
Not for another week.	Ɛnyɛ dapɛn foforo.
Some comments should also be made about the logistics.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka nsɛm bi nso fa nneɛma a wɔde bɛkɔ no ho.
Even better perhaps.	Nea eye sen saa mpo ebia.
Meetings must be arranged.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nhyiam ho nhyehyɛe.
He could be a very strong man.	Ná obetumi ayɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ den yiye.
It is not our opinion.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn adwene.
This is a busy street.	Eyi yɛ abɔnten a nnipa pii fa so.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Biribiara nni hɔ, biribiara nni hɔ, biribiara nni hɔ.
At least that is how he thinks of himself.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na osusuw ne ho.
I know where his mother is.	Minim baabi a ne maame wɔ.
Hard water, maybe.	Nsu a ɛyɛ den, ebia.
He was a terrible guy.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ hu.
Something inside me.	Biribi a ɛwɔ me mu.
They do so to further their own agenda.	Wɔyɛ saa de ma wɔn ankasa nhyehyɛe kɔ anim.
It was the first week of the new moon.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔsram foforo dapɛn a edi kan.
Why don’t you do that again?.	Dɛn nti na wonyɛ saa bio?.
This worked great for me.	Eyi yɛɛ adwuma kɛse maa me.
I think it was the case.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛte saa.
I saw this a lot.	Mihuu eyi pii.
The object was not there.	Ná ade no nni hɔ.
Many people have children.	Nnipa pii wɔ mma.
He did it anyway.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​ɔkwan biara so.
This will allow the user to actually see the problem.	Eyi bɛma nea ɔde di dwuma no ahu ɔhaw no ankasa.
But night was harder.	Nanso na anadwo yɛ den sen saa.
That would be a sin.	Ɛno bɛyɛ bɔne.
He was a very strong man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ den yiye.
Put this on.	Fa eyi hyɛ.
It was scary out there.	Ná ɛyɛ hu wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
Tell him about it.	Ka kyerɛ no.
We can get in, things can get out.	Yebetumi akɔ mu, nneɛma betumi afi adi.
It was never about money or fame for him.	Na ɛnyɛ sika anaa din pa ho da ma no.
And you want me to do that.	Na wopɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
Pictures or pictures will also work.	Mfonini anaa mfonini ahorow nso bɛyɛ adwuma.
They just talk about it, and everyone is happy.	Wɔka ho asɛm kɛkɛ, na obiara ani gye.
The date indicates the year.	Da no kyerɛ afe no.
He had to take some tests.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow bi.
Otherwise we use the setting again.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a yɛde nhyehyɛe no di dwuma bio.
He was just a nuisance.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔhaw bi kɛkɛ.
The books did nothing.	Nhoma ahorow no anyɛ hwee.
It was that time of year.	Ná ɛyɛ saa bere no wɔ afe no mu.
But in this case, it is not.	Nanso wɔ eyi mu no, ɛnte saa.
Not that you have to believe this story.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wugye saa asɛm yi di.
That will be fine now.	Ɛno bɛyɛ yiye mprempren.
How was he supposed to know?	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ dɛn hu?
It wasn’t my fault.	Na ɛnyɛ me mfomso.
His room had a large window.	Ná ne dan no wɔ mfɛnsere kɛse bi.
But they have to do that.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
How wonderful it is for us.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ nwonwa ma yɛn.
It is better if we all live closer together.	Sɛ yɛn nyinaa tra ase bɛn yɛn ho kɛse a, eye sen saa.
I don’t know when or how or why.	Minnim bere anaa ɔkwan bɛn so anaa nea enti a ɛte saa.
It was his city.	Ná ɛyɛ ne kurow.
Be careful about it.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ ho.
I once shared that view.	Bere bi na mewɔ saa adwene no bi.
You say you didn’t want this to happen.	Woka sɛ na wompɛ sɛ eyi ba.
I prefer cold winters.	Mepɛ awɔw bere a awɔw wom.
Get involved in it.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu.
It’s already the same.	Ɛyɛ saa ara dedaw.
It was a good time for me.	Ná ɛyɛ bere pa ma me.
He couldn't understand it himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa ntumi nte ase.
The number of systems is even.	Nhyehyɛe no dodow yɛ mpo.
There were only two things.	Ná nneɛma abien pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Most of the time, it’s beautiful.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛyɛ fɛ.
I look forward to working with you.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ me ne mo bɛyɛ adwuma.
The police had arrived.	Ná polisifo aba.
It’s this or nothing.	Ɛyɛ eyi anaasɛ hwee.
The bed was comfortable.	Ná mpa no yɛ fɛ.
Even this was never realistic.	Na eyi mpo nyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware da.
He put it down.	Ɔde too fam.
There was nothing in the man's face.	Na biribiara nni ɔbarima no anim.
None of the person really.	Onipa no mu biara ankasa.
Look at this interesting cat.	Hwɛ saa ɔkraman a ɔyɛ anigye yi.
But people get used to it.	Nanso nkurɔfo de yɛ wɔn su.
He dipped his hand in the hot water.	Ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ nsu a ɛyɛ hyew no mu.
I’d appreciate some help.	M’ani begye mmoa bi ho.
He should have said the same thing.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka saa ara.
He doesn’t do anything wrong.	Ɔnyɛ bɔne biara.
Both of you guys.	Mo baanu nyinaa.
If you think you can do it, you will.	Sɛ wususuw sɛ wubetumi ayɛ a, wobɛyɛ saa.
There was enough time to go.	Ná bere a ɛdɔɔso wɔ hɔ a wɔde bɛkɔ.
I really want to understand why.	Mepɛ sɛ mete nea enti a ɛte saa no ase ankasa.
Someone needs to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi hu.
He is a good man.	Ɔyɛ onipa pa.
Too many things to do.	Nneɛma pii dodo a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
It was just like a movie.	Ná ɛte sɛ sini ara kwa.
We’re interested in it.	Yɛn ani gye ho.
Pictures will be available soon.	Mfonini ahorow bɛba nnansa yi ara.
It’s pretty cool in that regard.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
If he steps on them .	Sɛ ɔde ne nan to wɔn so a .
Lots and lots of money.	Sika pii pii.
None of that is the problem.	Ɛno mu biara nyɛ ɔhaw no.
And this is it.	Na eyi ne no.
Apart from one person.	Sɛ onipa biako da nkyɛn a.
That shouldn’t be an issue.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm.
However, one thing remains.	Nanso, ade biako da so ara wɔ hɔ.
There is very little information in the narrative.	Nsɛm kakraa bi na ɛwɔ asɛm a wɔka no mu.
I still remember that first morning.	Meda so ara kae saa anɔpa a edi kan no.
So, we were on it.	Enti, na yɛwɔ so.
He looked into it, too.	Ɔno nso hwɛɛ mu.
We were in a way.	Ná yɛwɔ ɔkwan bi so.
There would be better times.	Anka bere a eye sen saa bɛba.
It wasn’t bad this time.	Ná ɛnyɛ bɔne saa bere yi.
Those things happen here.	Saa nneɛma no kɔ so wɔ ha.
The soundtrack itself can be beautiful.	Nnwom a wɔde bɔ nnwom no ankasa betumi ayɛ fɛ.
No one can really help me with it.	Obiara ntumi mmoa me wɔ ho ankasa.
So this affects a lot of people.	Enti eyi ka nnipa pii.
I am so sorry about that.	Ɛyɛ me yaw paa wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
He says he is innocent.	Ɔka sɛ ne ho nni asɛm.
In other words, nothing new here.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, biribi foforo biara nni ha.
But this is not fun for you.	Nanso eyi nyɛ anigye mma wo.
There is nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
Maybe not for long.	Ebia ɛnyɛ bere tenten.
And more power to them.	Na tumi pii nso ma wɔn.
But it’s not all that simple.	Nanso ne nyinaa nyɛ mmerɛw saa.
You may feel better.	Ebia wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
You never need to use it otherwise.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode yɛ adwuma da sɛ ɛnte saa.
As the saying goes, you don’t always have to believe what you see.	Sɛnea wɔka no, ɛnsɛ sɛ wugye nea wuhu no di bere nyinaa.
Maybe we can do it next time in my bedroom.	Ebia yebetumi ayɛ no bere foforo wɔ me mpa mu.
He can help here.	Obetumi aboa wɔ ha.
I just wanted to say so much.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka ase kɛse ara kwa.
Many of us enjoy that.	Yɛn mu pii ani gye ho saa.
Maybe you don’t.	Ebia wonyɛ saa.
Everyone is happy, too happy.	Obiara ani gye, ani gye dodo.
It was very cold.	Ná awɔw wom paa.
These objects have different characteristics.	Saa nneɛma yi wɔ su ahorow.
One should apologize when one has done wrong.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi pa kyɛw bere a wayɛ bɔne no.
I give one more, not a bit of fun.	Mede biako bio ma, ɛnyɛ anigye kakra.
You have a problem now!	Wowɔ ɔhaw bi mprempren!
He seemed surprised by this.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi ho dwiriw no.
I know where everyone lives.	Minim baabi a obiara te.
It was the latter.	Ná ɛyɛ nea etwa to no.
He was placed under house arrest.	Wɔde no too afiase wɔ fie.
Because of my sin.	Me bɔne nti.
That’s not the case either.	Ɛno nso nyɛ saa.
I would have done more.	Anka mɛyɛ pii.
Everything is really nice and simple and easy.	Biribiara yɛ fɛ ankasa na ɛnyɛ den na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Everything you say is true.	Biribiara a wobɛka no yɛ nokware.
Right now we have approx.	Seesei ara yɛwɔ bɛyɛ.
But he wasn’t quite fast enough.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ ntɛm koraa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
You have to take risks.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho to asiane mu.
He was just sitting there.	Ná ɔte hɔ ara kwa.
He’s on it again.	Ɔwɔ so bio.
I can't get into it yet.	Mintumi nkɔ mu de besi nnɛ.
It was good but still needed a lot of time.	Ná eye nanso na ɛda so ara hia bere pii.
Finally, it all came to an end.	Awiei koraa no, ne nyinaa baa awiei.
You just want to know.	Nea wopɛ ara ne sɛ wuhu.
I've done it before.	Mayɛ no pɛn.
He didn't know what to do.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛyɛ.
A handful of ingredients are necessary.	Nneɛma a wɔde yɛ aduan no nsa kakraa bi na ɛho hia.
The transfer was to take place the next day.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn kɔ baabi foforo no da a edi hɔ no.
He is not an independent.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ɔde ne ho.
We have a job to do.	Yɛwɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
Our room will come.	Yɛn dan bɛba.
Next time, he told himself.	Bere foforo no, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho.
I’m very happy with myself.	M’ani gye me ho yiye.
But it is best to do it quickly.	Nanso eye sɛ wobɛyɛ no ntɛmntɛm.
He has something on him too.	Ɔno nso wɔ biribi wɔ ne so.
Pick up the phone.	Fa telefon no.
We should all be happy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa ani gye.
It’s like the car windows.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔde yɛ kar mfɛnsere no.
I was there you know.	Na mewɔ hɔ a wunim.
They seemed to like him very much.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani gye ne ho yiye.
He wants to sleep alone at night.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno nkutoo da anadwo.
He knew only too well what followed.	Ná onim nea edi akyi no yiye dodo.
We own them.	Yɛn na yɛwɔ wɔn.
No one does that.	Obiara nyɛ saa.
If he could, he didn't want to feel that way again.	Sɛ obetumi a, na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔte nka saa bio.
This is true, but besides the point.	Eyi yɛ nokware, nanso asɛm no akyi.
The truth never matters a bit.	Nokware no ho nhia kakra da.
But otherwise, it was just the two of them.	Nanso sɛ ɛnte saa a, na ɛyɛ wɔn baanu no nkutoo.
He had almost nothing.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na onni hwee.
The animal was very large.	Ná aboa no yɛ kɛse paa.
Or at least it used to be.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, kan no na ɛte saa.
They all have busy schedules.	Wɔn nyinaa wɔ nhyehyɛe a adagyew nnim.
There was a lot going on.	Ná nneɛma pii rekɔ so.
Everyone has a license with a license.	Obiara wɔ tumi krataa a ɔwɔ tumi krataa.
But not in this case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa asɛm yi mu.
Or for that matter, that there even was.	Anaasɛ ɛno nti, sɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ mpo.
But he would do his best.	Nanso na ɔbɛyɛ nea obetumi biara.
He was a perfect man.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa a ɔyɛ pɛ.
They are used.	Wɔde di dwuma.
There is nothing any of us could have done.	Biribiara nni hɔ a anka yɛn mu biara betumi ayɛ.
Things are just obviously things.	Nneɛma da hɔ ara kwa sɛ ɛyɛ nneɛma.
It’s very important.	Ɛho hia paa.
It’s amazing that people have created such a mindset.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ nkurɔfo abɔ adwene a ɛte saa.
I have been.	Mayɛ.
We have to work to do the same.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma de yɛ saa ara.
You people are amazing to me.	Mo nkurɔfo yɛ nwonwa ma me.
He didn't know what he was doing.	Ná onnim nea ɔyɛ.
You also employ most people.	Wo nso wode nnipa dodow no ara yɛ adwuma.
You have to be good at it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ho akokwaw wɔ mu.
I really wanted to touch you.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mede me nsa ka wo paa.
Most importantly, its affordability surprises us.	Nea ɛho hia sen biara no, ne bo a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no ma yɛn ho dwiriw yɛn.
Is there wrong there, at all.	So mfomso wɔ hɔ wɔ hɔ, koraa.
The thing was brand new.	Ná ade no yɛ foforo koraa.
It was over.	Ná aba awiei.
But it’s beautiful anyway.	Nanso ɛyɛ fɛ ɔkwan biara so.
Two remain, however.	Nanso, abien da so ara wɔ hɔ.
And this one looks real enough too.	Na eyi nso hwɛ ankasa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
They took him to their room.	Wɔde no kɔɔ wɔn dan mu.
No one had a name.	Ná obiara nni din.
The meeting was adjourned.	Wɔde nhyiam no too nkyɛn.
That house must be very old.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ saa fie no akyɛ paa.
It’s important.	Ɛho hia.
The other two followed.	Nnipa baanu a aka no dii akyi.
We have the last days of winter still.	Yɛwɔ awɔw bere mu nna a edi akyiri no da so ara.
It has the same size as the input images.	Ɛwɔ ne kɛse te sɛ mfonini ahorow a wɔde hyɛ mu no.
You are such a good person to talk about anything.	Woyɛ obi a eye saa sɛ wobɛka biribiara ho asɛm.
In the long run.	Wɔ bere tenten mu.
He should be put aside.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde no to nkyɛn.
That had been a disaster.	Ná ɛno ayɛ asiane.
Let all these numbers be.	Ma dodow yi nyinaa nyɛ.
Those things.	Saa nneɛma no.
In this case, everyone got what they wanted.	Wɔ asɛm yi mu no, obiara nyaa nea ɔpɛ.
Go to the table.	Kɔ pon no so.
I heard a knock on the door.	Metee sɛ obi rebɔ ɔpon no mu.
They are just beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ ara kwa.
Really? 	Pa ara?
he says that.	ɔka sɛ.
Perhaps neither came here.	Ebia mu biara amma wɔ ha.
I’d like to say thank you.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛka sɛ meda wo ase.
There was absolutely nothing wrong with it.	Na mfomso biara nni ho koraa.
He was charming in a way.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
That would be a very big deal.	Ɛno bɛyɛ asɛm kɛse paa.
But not this man.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa ɔbarima yi.
Many people liked his clothes.	Ná nnipa pii ani gye ne ntade ho.
I know people do that.	Minim sɛ nkurɔfo yɛ saa.
Show him what a great guy you are.	Kyerɛ no sɛnea woyɛ ɔbarima kɛse.
I do have one, by the way.	Mewɔ bi ampa, ɔkwan bi so no.
That would be interesting.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
It’s very difficult.	Ɛyɛ den yiye.
The final season of this year is over.	Afe yi awiei bere no aba awiei.
Look out the window.	Hwɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
It is something they cannot do on their own.	Ɛyɛ biribi a wɔn ankasa ntumi nyɛ.
They each signed for two years.	Wɔn mu biara de ne nsa hyɛɛ ase mfe abien.
He works for both of us.	Ɔyɛ adwuma ma yɛn baanu nyinaa.
This may be really painful.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ yaw ankasa.
Most made a decision.	Dodow no ara sii gyinae.
You know what it’s like down there.	Wunim sɛnea ɛte wɔ fam hɔ.
But only himself.	Nanso ɔno ankasa nkutoo.
Is this the most expensive thing here?	So eyi ne ade a ne bo yɛ den sen biara wɔ ha?
He leaned against the bed.	Ɔde ne ho too mpa no so.
Put yourself in my shoes.	Fa wo ho hyɛ me mpaboa mu.
The first without the kids.	Nea edi kan a mmofra no nni mu.
Don’t get too excited.	Mma w’ani nnye ho dodo.
It is a fully implemented system.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe a wɔde di dwuma koraa.
That’s just the way things are.	Saa ara ne sɛnea nneɛma te.
But it is not perfect.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea edi mũ.
That will always be the target.	Ɛno na ɛbɛyɛ nea wɔde wɔn ani asi so bere nyinaa.
I still want to.	Meda so ara pɛ.
None of us can do that.	Yɛn mu biara ntumi nyɛ saa.
No one mentioned it.	Obiara anka ho asɛm.
There is some truth to that.	Nokware bi wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
Everything is free for users.	Biribiara yɛ kwa ma wɔn a wɔde di dwuma no.
It is a given.	Ɛyɛ ade a wɔde ama.
It’s not me.	Ɛnyɛ me.
No one seems to be on the road.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara nni ɔkwan no so.
I love the variety.	M’ani gye nneɛma ahorow a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho.
Are you sure you know what you’re doing?	So wugye di sɛ wunim nea woreyɛ?
It has two mouths.	Ɛwɔ ano abien.
They were my friends.	Ná wɔyɛ me nnamfo.
The dog usually wins.	Ɔkraman taa di nkonim.
Everyone at all.	Obiara koraa.
Look at what’s going on.	Hwɛ nea ɛrekɔ so.
The boy's words rang like a dog.	Abarimaa no nsɛm no bɔɔ te sɛ ɔkraman.
When you see yourself.	Bere a wuhu wo ho no.
Everyone has been here.	Obiara akɔ ha.
But only if you want to.	Nanso sɛ wopɛ nkutoo a.
Content mattered.	Ná nneɛma a ɛwɔ mu no ho hia.
There was a truth.	Ná nokware bi wɔ hɔ.
I want to know what happened in the last one.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea esii wɔ nea etwa to no mu.
Neither may be easy at all.	Ebia mu biara nyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
They shouldn’t be.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
The fault lies with the person.	Mfomso no da onipa no so.
A little bit, anyway.	Kakraa bi, sɛnea ɛte biara.
I thought about this.	Misusuw eyi ho.
The former was the best.	Kan no na eye sen biara.
There was only one chance left.	Ná hokwan biako pɛ na aka.
It was once interesting here.	Bere bi na ɛyɛ anigye wɔ ha.
All of this takes time.	Eyi nyinaa gye bere.
No news yet.	Asɛm biara nni hɔ de besi nnɛ.
He had to figure out what that was.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ osusuw nea ɛno yɛ ho.
He wasn’t that kind of person.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a ɔte saa.
There are some good things to know.	Nneɛma pa bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
However, he had many good friends.	Nanso, na ɔwɔ nnamfo pa pii.
He has done so.	Wayɛ saa.
I couldn’t figure out how to put it.	Na mintumi nsusuw sɛnea mede besi hɔ no ho.
I hope for better things.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ nneɛma pa bɛba.
He had done so.	Ná wayɛ saa.
I do my best, thank you.	Meyɛ nea metumi biara, meda wo ase.
I had them both.	Ná mewɔ wɔn baanu nyinaa.
Very easy to use.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
This was true.	Ná eyi yɛ nokware.
His mind couldn’t process it.	N’adwene antumi anyɛ ho adwuma.
I need to work on that with you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo yɛ saa ho adwuma.
Last year fell for years.	Afe a etwaam no hwee ase mfe pii.
Every child has bad days.	Abofra biara wɔ nna bɔne.
That’s how I felt.	Saa ara na metee nka.
I can take it.	Metumi agye.
The two friends didn’t talk much.	Nnamfo baanu no ankasa pii.
If you are a	Sɛ woyɛ obi a .
He always brings it.	Ɔde ba bere nyinaa.
However, not much more than a few good clothes.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ pii sɛ ntade pa kakraa bi.
I can’t do this.	Mintumi nyɛ eyi.
Thank you, but you don't have to be there.	Meda wo ase, nanso enhia sɛ wowɔ hɔ.
I was just there.	Ná mewɔ hɔ ara kwa.
His power continued to grow.	Ne tumi kɔɔ so yɛɛ kɛse.
There was plenty of water.	Ná nsu pii wɔ hɔ.
There was not much in it.	Ná nneɛma pii nni mu.
He didn't seem to want to talk about it.	Ɛte sɛ nea na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka ho asɛm.
Everyone can see that.	Obiara tumi hu saa.
This one didn’t have one.	Ná eyi nni bi.
It’s an interesting job, but it’s a bad job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ anigye, nanso ɛyɛ adwuma bɔne.
You don’t have to think about it too much.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wususuw ho pii.
But this method does not work well.	Nanso saa kwan yi nyɛ adwuma yiye.
Fear of the abnormal.	Nneɛma a ɛnyɛ ne kwan so ho suro.
I am more like my father than my mother.	Mete sɛ me papa sen me maame.
That’s his words.	Ɛno ne ne nsɛm.
Watch it now below.	Hwɛ no mprempren wɔ ase hɔ.
But you are among friends.	Nanso woka nnamfo ho.
That wasn’t so good.	Ná ɛno nyɛ papa saa.
I have an idea about that, but nothing came of it.	Mewɔ adwene bi wɔ saa asɛm no ho, nanso biribiara ankɔ so.
She snuggled in his arms.	Ɔde ne ho gyee ne ho wɔ ne nsa so.
But it is in bad shape.	Nanso ɛwɔ tebea bɔne mu.
I really feel strong.	Mete nka ankasa sɛ me ho yɛ den.
And it was terrible.	Na ɛyɛ hu.
And keep thinking about things.	Na kɔ so susuw nneɛma ho.
I felt really great.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ kɛse ankasa.
But there seemed to be something wrong with him.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea asɛm bi wɔ ne ho.
I want to say something.	Mepɛ sɛ meka biribi.
Maybe, maybe we can.	Ebia, ebia yebetumi.
This is what it looks like.	Eyi ne sɛnea ɛte.
I was the only one who knew where he was, you see.	Me nkutoo na na minim baabi a ɔwɔ, wuhu.
He says people know this stuff.	Ɔka sɛ nkurɔfo nim saa ade yi.
He doesn’t have time either.	Ɔno nso onni bere.
You know, which is just great.	Wunim, a ɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa.
That happened a lot back then.	Ɛno sii pii saa bere no.
He had the most amazing hands.	Ná ɔwɔ nsa a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen biara.
I hear things.	Mete nneɛma.
There wasn't much else to do.	Ná nneɛma foforo pii nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I go to him.	Mekɔ ne nkyɛn.
Most people question the car as a great deal.	Nnipa dodow no ara gye kar no ho kyim sɛ ɛyɛ ade kɛse.
He should never have won and he knew it.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ odi nkonim da na onim.
Keep up the good works.	Kɔ so yɛ nnwuma pa.
The latter has no experimental validity.	Nea etwa to no nni sɔhwɛ mu tumi.
They were his favorite animals.	Ná wɔyɛ mmoa a n’ani gye ho paa.
That’s what he says.	Ɛno ne nea ɔka.
It’s a good and important story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm pa ne asɛm a ɛho hia.
If you have one, talk about it.	Sɛ wowɔ bi a, ka ho asɛm.
That is already happening.	Ɛno rekɔ so dedaw.
And the shoes, too.	Na mpaboa no nso.
Just keep living.	Kɔ so tra ase kɛkɛ.
Most agree that they do.	Dodow no ara gye tom sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
That will be fine.	Ɛno bɛyɛ yiye.
The city was famous for its handicrafts.	Ná kurow no agye din wɔ nneɛma a wɔde nsa yɛ ho.
Not even one thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade biako mpo.
But he wasn’t perfect.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ pɛ.
Surely you should know that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu saa.
Maybe it’s a sin.	Ebia ɛyɛ bɔne.
I was kind of the guy there.	Ná meyɛ ɔbarima a ɔwɔ hɔ no bi.
What is it with you guys.	Dɛn na ɛwɔ mo ho.
I never wanted any of this trouble.	Ná mempɛ ɔhaw yi mu biara da.
Displeasure with his blindness.	Anigye a onni wɔ n’ani a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no ho.
He has done things like that before.	Wayɛ nneɛma a ɛte saa pɛn.
And I can’t tell.	Na mintumi nka.
Back to the legs.	San kɔ nan so.
But not as it used to be.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛnea na ɛte kan no.
Doing something most of us do every day anyway.	Biribi a yɛn mu dodow no ara yɛ da biara da ɔkwan biara so a yɛbɛyɛ.
But handle it carefully.	Nanso di ho dwuma yiye.
Everything went well, everything went well.	Biribiara kɔɔ yiye, biribiara kɔɔ yiye.
None of these things are true.	Saa nneɛma yi mu biara nyɛ nokware.
He was always full of information.	Ná nsɛm ahyɛ no ma bere nyinaa.
The observation period was two years.	Bere a wɔde hwɛɛ nneɛma no yɛ mfe abien.
But for him, this didn’t matter.	Nanso wɔ ne fam no, na eyi ho nhia.
It was cold, and he was in pain.	Ná awɔw wom, na na ne ho yɛ no yaw.
But this is a serious mistake.	Nanso eyi yɛ mfomso kɛse.
Every year there is one or two cases.	Afe biara asɛm biako anaa abien ba.
We are just free of it.	Yɛde ne ho ara kwa.
He is a man of integrity.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a odi nokware.
The work is much harder than it used to be.	Adwuma no mu yɛ den sen sɛnea na ɛte kan no koraa.
You have to work too.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ adwuma.
This kid freaks me out a bit.	Saa abofra yi ma me ho dwiriw me kakra.
You can have as much as you want.	Wubetumi anya pii sɛnea wopɛ.
There’s very little you need to do.	Kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I don’t want to do that.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
I don’t know how, but it has happened.	Minnim sɛnea ɛte saa, nanso aba saa.
She was beautiful tonight.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ anadwo yi.
You don’t have to work anymore.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma bio.
And eat something.	Na di biribi.
He has a lot of money	Ɔwɔ sika pii
It had been a bad weekend for him.	Ná ayɛ dapɛn awiei bɔne ama no.
Two more points to make.	Nsɛm abien foforo a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
He shouldn’t have said anything.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔka biribiara.
This help did not work.	Saa mmoa yi anyɛ yiye.
She without a child.	Ɔno a onni abofra.
Or maybe not for him.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛnyɛ ne de.
It’s only easy for the most part.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw nkutoo wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu.
Most people just like it.	Nnipa dodow no ara ani gye ho nkutoo.
There is nothing you can do about it now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ wɔ ho mprempren.
There should be more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ pii ka ho.
I didn’t know what to think.	Ná minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
I didn’t know what to do.	Ná minnim nea menyɛ.
These shoes are too thick.	Saa mpaboa yi yɛ den dodo.
He knows you’re not what he wants.	Onim sɛ wonyɛ nea ɔpɛ.
Look what happened.	Hwɛ nea asi.
I have a little problem.	Mewɔ ɔhaw kakra bi.
I was not one of these people.	Ná menyɛ saa nnipa yi mu biako.
He put the book on the table.	Ɔde nhoma no too pon no so.
John, thank you.	John, meda wo ase.
There didn't seem to be much need to bring.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia sɛ wɔde pii bɛba.
There are so many things to do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
Not on their own, that is.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn ankasa so, kyerɛ sɛ.
It’s power, here, for good.	Ɛyɛ tumi, ha, ma papa.
He leaned his head out the window.	Ɔde ne ti too mfɛnsere no mu.
I am not that strong as they say.	Menyɛ den saa sɛnea wɔka no.
In the morning song outside the window.	Wɔ anɔpa dwom a ɛwɔ mfɛnsere no akyi no mu.
This could be very exciting for him.	Eyi betumi ayɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse ama no.
But please do this one thing for me.	Nanso mesrɛ wo, yɛ ade biako yi ara mma me.
Don’t tell him.	Mma wo nka nkyerɛ no.
His reasons were good.	Ná nea enti a ɔyɛ saa no yɛ nea eye.
Make him smile.	Ma n’ani nnye.
He was told that he was in the group.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ na ɔwɔ kuw no mu.
He was in there.	Ná ɔwɔ mu wɔ hɔ.
He may be very interested in you.	Ebia n’ani gye wo ho kɛse.
They are very beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Close like me and my dad.	Bɛn te sɛ me ne me papa.
His mother told him what to do.	Ne maame kyerɛɛ no ​​nea ɔnyɛ.
It would all be fine.	Anka ne nyinaa bɛyɛ yiye.
That’s my picture.	Ɛno ne me mfonini.
We’re friends, in a way.	Yɛyɛ nnamfo, ɔkwan bi so.
Please, tell me.	Mesrɛ wo, ka kyerɛ me.
This, in my opinion, is not true.	Eyi, wɔ m’adwene mu no, ɛnyɛ nokware.
I feel what he feels.	Mete nea ɔte nka no nka.
Most were children.	Ná dodow no ara yɛ mmofra.
But in the end, it works that way anyway.	Nanso awiei koraa no, ɛyɛ adwuma saa nea ɛte biara.
However, I can’t do it alone.	Nanso, me nkutoo ntumi nyɛ.
That will be difficult.	Ɛno bɛyɛ den.
There is some very interesting information here.	Nsɛm bi a ɛyɛ anigye yiye wɔ ha.
What did you remember?	Dɛn na wokae?
You are stronger than you think.	Wo ho yɛ den sen sɛnea wususuw.
Friends have interests.	Nnamfo wɔ nneɛma a wɔn ani gye ho.
Finally, it was over.	Awiei koraa no, na aba awiei.
Maybe he can get a team interested.	Ebia obetumi ama kuw bi ani agye ho.
Within the allotted time.	Wɔ bere a wɔde ama no mu.
This has at least two very important problems.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, eyi wɔ ɔhaw ahorow abien a ɛho hia yiye.
And it’s not just books.	Na ɛnyɛ nhoma nkutoo.
Get them out of the house from time to time.	Yi wɔn fi fie hɔ bere ne bere mu.
My house is full of life.	Nkwa ahyɛ me fie ma.
I don’t care about them.	Wɔn ho nhia me.
I was pretty involved.	Ná mede me ho ahyɛ mu yiye.
I want to go to the gym.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ.
They are simply not as beautiful as you.	Nea wɔyɛ ara ne sɛ wɔn ho nyɛ fɛ te sɛ wo.
Go to the main street of the town.	Kɔ kurow no abɔnten kɛse no so.
Accidental and devastating at that.	Akwanhyia ne nea ɛyɛ hu wɔ saa bere no mu.
He kicked the floor.	Ɔde ne nan bɔɔ fam.
It contained several early chapters.	Ná ti ahorow pii a edi kan wom.
He has control over my hand.	Ɔwɔ me nsa so tumi.
That is simply a mistake.	Ɛno yɛ mfomso ara kwa.
I couldn’t get to him.	Na mintumi nkɔ ne nkyɛn.
He didn’t even have a gun.	Ná onni tuo mpo.
This diet has really worked for me.	Saa aduan yi ayɛ adwuma ama me ankasa.
The producers loved the story.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ sini no ani gyee asɛm no ho.
I wasn’t interested in it.	Ná m’ani nnye ho.
It looks beautiful.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
He too is worried.	Ɔno nso haw ne ho.
However, it still didn’t work.	Nanso, na ɛda so ara ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
It’s everything now.	Ɛyɛ biribiara mprempren.
He was always good kids.	Ná ɔyɛ mmofra pa bere nyinaa.
And no one does anything about it.	Na obiara nyɛ ho hwee.
However, this is a challenging task using this information.	Nanso, eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den a wɔde saa nsɛm yi bedi dwuma.
That’s the whole point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no nyinaa.
And look at him.	Na hwɛ no.
He leaned against the window.	Ɔde ne ho bɔɔ mfɛnsere no mu.
A man came along.	Ɔbarima bi baa hɔ.
But it’s one of two mistakes.	Nanso ɛyɛ mfomso abien no mu biako.
I have a lot of things.	Mewɔ nneɛma pii.
This only happened occasionally.	Ná eyi ba bere ne bere mu nkutoo.
This is not a problem.	Eyi nyɛ ɔhaw.
However, he is happy.	Nanso, ɔwɔ anigye.
He always seemed to hang out with me.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔne no bɔ me ho bere nyinaa.
I’m very excited to go.	M’ani gye ho paa sɛ mɛkɔ.
But that’s only part of the story.	Nanso ɛno yɛ asɛm no fã bi kɛkɛ.
That he wanted her.	Sɛ na ɔpɛ no.
I’m not sure what to do.	M’ani gyee ho.
Keep telling him.	Kɔ so ka no.
Finally, there is hope.	Awiei koraa no, anidaso wɔ hɔ.
It’s not that simple .	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa sɛ .
When did this happen?	Bere bɛn na eyi sii?
We had a job to do.	Na yɛwɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
But in what way? 	Nanso ɔkwan bɛn so?
No one was interested.	Ná obiara ani nnye ho.
he slipped to the ground.	ɔde ne ho bɔɔ fam.
It’s my favorite thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a m’ani gye ho paa.
Cars can be a big problem.	Kar betumi ayɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
Your time with mine may have been long by now.	Ebia wo bere ne me de no ayɛ tenten de besi nnɛ.
The idea is wrong.	Adwene no yɛ mfomso.
You say he has sinned.	Woka sɛ wayɛ bɔne.
If possible.	Sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye a.
I can make this work for you.	Metumi ama eyi ayɛ adwuma ama wo.
I wanted to be his.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ne de.
But the look in her eyes.	Nanso hwɛ a ɛwɔ n’ani so no.
He makes interesting statements.	Ɔka nsɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
It’s hard to do anything.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ biribiara.
I can’t get over this.	Mintumi nni eyi so nkonim.
It wasn’t a mistake.	Ná ɛnyɛ mfomso.
Few are actually like that.	Kakraa na ɛte saa ankasa.
New every day.	Foforo da biara da.
This means flexibility.	Eyi kyerɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I don't have any of that.	Minni saa nneɛma no mu biara.
They shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
That’s the reason for it.	Ɛno ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
Show, feel.	Kyerɛ, nka.
Man was pleased with himself.	Onipa ani gyee ne ho.
He knew exactly how to do that.	Ná onim sɛnea ɔbɛyɛ saa yiye.
This is a technique that has been widely used in recent years.	Eyi yɛ ɔkwan a wɔde di dwuma kɛse wɔ nnansa yi mfe mu.
Even so, he knows.	Ɛno mpo no, onim.
There is nothing he can do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
And you probably know his name.	Na ebia wunim ne din.
This is not very common.	Eyi nyɛ nea abu so kɛse.
However, he knew what to say.	Nanso, na onim nea ɔbɛka.
But most people, like me, feel weird.	Nanso nnipa dodow no ara, te sɛ me, te nka sɛ wɔyɛ nwonwa.
That’s not even part of the story.	Ɛno nyɛ asɛm no fã mpo.
Don't take them here too often.	Mfa wɔn nkɔ ha mpɛn pii.
It wasn’t like that.	Ná ɛnte saa.
He had my opinion.	Ná ɔwɔ m’adwene.
That’s something we do.	Ɛno yɛ biribi a yɛyɛ.
But maybe he does.	Nanso ebia ɔyɛ saa.
But again, that is not our case.	Nanso bio, ɛnyɛ yɛn asɛm no te saa.
That was the only chance we had.	Ɛno nkutoo ne hokwan a na yɛwɔ.
Know all the important things	Hu nneɛma a ɛho hia nyinaa
He talks about everything.	Ɔka biribiara ho asɛm.
Whatever actually happened, the great test was over.	Nea esii ankasa biara no, na sɔhwɛ kɛse no aba awiei.
It’s in your doing.	Ɛwɔ wo yɛ mu.
There’s the letter, kid.	Krataa no wɔ hɔ, abofra.
I do this and that every day.	Meyɛ eyi ne saa da biara da.
Whatever his name is.	Nea ne din te biara.
It was just a great story.	Na ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse bi kɛkɛ.
Too many cars on the road.	Kar pii dodo wɔ kwan so.
This was a great moment.	Ná eyi yɛ bere kɛse.
You can tell me anything.	Wubetumi aka biribiara akyerɛ me.
I want to say that time goes on.	Mepɛ sɛ meka sɛ bere kɔ so.
His stare startled her.	N’ani a ɔde hwɛ ade denneennen no maa ne ho dwiriw no.
I don't want anything	Mempɛ hwee .
And he knew the game.	Na na onim agoru no.
So was his mother.	Saa ara na na ne maame nso te.
This is a game.	Eyi yɛ agoru.
The highway was packed with traffic.	Ná kar ahyɛ ɔkwan kɛse no so.
And maybe they do.	Na ebia wɔyɛ saa.
You are more human than you know.	Woyɛ onipa sen sɛnea wunim.
It was obviously not.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛnte saa.
However, truth is hard.	Nanso, nokware yɛ den.
I should have told my kids.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ me mma no.
Maybe there is a way.	Ebia ɔkwan bi wɔ hɔ.
That’s the only language you speak.	Ɛno nkutoo ne kasa a woka.
The details are amazing.	Nsɛm no yɛ nwonwa.
Population decline will cause problems.	Nnipa dodow a ɛrekɔ fam no de ɔhaw bɛba.
But maybe it was.	Nanso ebia na ɛte saa.
There was some food left.	Ná aduan bi aka.
A child has no right to play in the park.	Abofra nni hokwan sɛ odi agoru wɔ abɔnten so.
I was still doing it more, but less.	Ná meda so ara reyɛ no pii, nanso na mereyɛ kakraa bi.
I think it’s the same.	Misusuw sɛ ɛte saa.
He glanced around the room.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ dan no mu nyinaa.
There is some truth to that.	Nokware bi wɔ hɔ a ɛwɔ saa asɛm no mu.
The problem is also new.	Ɔhaw no nso yɛ foforo.
A lot of the movie takes place on a beautiful day.	Sini no pii kɔ so wɔ da a ɛyɛ fɛ mu.
I am sorry that things ended this way.	Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ nneɛma baa awiei wɔ saa kwan yi so.
So I work every day.	Enti meyɛ adwuma da biara da.
I liked the story, too.	M’ani gyee asɛm no ho, nso.
What we need to do now is to take action.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ mprempren ne sɛ yɛbɛyɛ ho biribi.
I just wanted to believe it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye di ara kwa.
I knew what this meant.	Ná minim nea eyi kyerɛ.
Anyone who wants to.	Obiara a ɔpɛ.
See what we can do.	Hwɛ nea yebetumi ayɛ.
So just approach me.	Enti bɛn me kɛkɛ.
So give yourself some time.	Enti ma wo ho bere kakra.
He was in her care.	Ná ɔwɔ ne hwɛ mu.
And this seemed to be it.	Na ɛte sɛ nea eyi ne no.
I love that car.	M’ani gye saa kar no ho.
I know it’s true.	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
Nowadays, it is very important.	Mprempren, ɛho hia yiye.
All entries must be complete and accurate.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nsɛm a wɔde hyɛ mu no nyinaa di mũ na ɛyɛ nokware.
They were an unlikely pair.	Ná wɔyɛ baanu a ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
I had forgotten him.	Ná me werɛ fii no.
A little bit, if anything.	Kakraa bi, sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a.
There is no need to do so.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
You can do this before or after the initial setup.	Wubetumi ayɛ eyi ansa na woayɛ nhyehyɛe a edi kan no anaasɛ woayɛ no akyi.
This is too strange.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa dodo.
I would really really like it.	Anka m’ani begye ho ankasa ankasa.
The beautiful thing is what happened next.	Ade a ɛyɛ fɛ ne nea esii akyi no.
He exists, pictures and all.	Ɔwɔ hɔ, mfonini ne ne nyinaa.
You can’t go on like that.	Worentumi nkɔ so saa.
It was too late to do anything by then.	Ná aka akyi dodo sɛ mɛyɛ biribiara saa bere no.
This was true.	Ná eyi yɛ nokware.
Their children were their priority.	Ná wɔn mma no na wɔde di kan.
It’s not just me.	Ɛnyɛ me ara kwa.
It was midnight.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo fã.
The One who does wonderful things.	Nea ɔyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa no.
Both work and sleep are important.	Adwuma ne nna nyinaa ho hia.
Anyway, it works now.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛyɛ adwuma mprempren.
She feels completely out of place at this party.	Ɔte nka sɛ onni baabi koraa wɔ apontow yi mu.
Your hair is beautiful.	Wo ti nhwi no yɛ fɛ.
Now he doesn’t want to play at all.	Seesei ɔmpɛ sɛ odi agoru koraa.
Or, at least, they should.	Anaasɛ, anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
She knew he wanted her too.	Ná onim sɛ ɔno nso pɛ no.
If they ever were.	Sɛ na wɔyɛ saa da bi a.
I told him not to do anything.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribiara.
His presence is always there.	Ne ba a ɔwɔ hɔ no wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
Not a bad face, either.	Ɛnyɛ anim bɔne, nso.
I just do them for fun.	Meyɛ wɔn de gye wɔn ani kɛkɛ.
We enjoyed ourselves.	Yɛn ani gyee yɛn ho.
Finally, the date was set.	Awiei koraa no, wɔde da no too hɔ.
I had room service last night.	Na mewɔ dan mu adwuma anadwo a etwaam no.
Lots of photos.	Mfonini ahorow pii.
But the problems remain.	Nanso ɔhaw ahorow no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Good learning!	Adesua pa!
Share your stories.	Ka wo nsɛm no ho asɛm.
When it is necessary to do so.	Bere a ɛho hia sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Take the time to get to know him.	Gye bere fa hu no.
The group can’t do that.	Kuw no ntumi nyɛ saa.
I look forward to the time.	Mehwɛ bere no kwan.
Both affect what you can and should bring.	Nneɛma abien no nyinaa ka nea wubetumi de aba ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ wode ba no.
There was definitely something.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na biribi wɔ hɔ.
A terrible mistake.	Mfomso a ɛyɛ hu.
But you’ve done it.	Nanso woayɛ saa.
Maybe you can help us with this project.	Ebia wubetumi aboa yɛn wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
Sleeping makes one sleepy.	Nna a obi da no ma obi da.
The squirrel didn’t come.	Ɔkraman no amma.
I had to figure out what to do fast.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ho ntɛmntɛm.
He’s about to go in, but the last time, he doesn’t.	Ɔreyɛ akɔ mu, nanso bere a etwa to no, ɔnyɛ saa.
Nothing else, trust me.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ, gye me di.
The problem has been going on for years.	Ɔhaw no akɔ so mfe pii.
You'd really have to do better, though.	Nanso, anka ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ yiye ankasa.
I just have to keep going.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so ara kwa.
Morning naps were my favorite time of day.	Ná anɔpa nna ne bere a m’ani gye ho kɛse wɔ da no mu.
What do you think of this book?	Dɛn na wususuw wɔ nhoma yi ho?
The trend continued.	Su no kɔɔ so.
I think there is something you want from me.	Misusuw sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a wopɛ fi me hɔ.
He had already painted his hands.	Ná wayɛ ne nsa ho mfonini dedaw.
I don’t really care, though.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ me asɛm ankasa.
We do this every day.	Yɛyɛ eyi da biara da.
He tells me everything.	Ɔno na ɔka biribiara kyerɛ me.
In the present.	Wɔ mprempren mu.
The day was hot, but so was he.	Ná da no mu yɛ hyew, nanso na ɔno nso yɛ hyew.
It wasn’t really a house.	Ná ɛnyɛ ofie ankasa.
The party is over.	Apontow no aba awiei.
None of us had that.	Yɛn mu biara nni hɔ a na ɔwɔ saa.
Many people drove to work.	Nnipa pii de kar kɔɔ adwuma.
The way things are.	Nneɛma kwan.
He didn't know what else to do.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛyɛ bio.
None of us can go home now.	Yɛn mu biara ntumi nkɔ fie mprempren.
Things moved really fast after that.	Nneɛma kɔɔ so ntɛmntɛm ankasa wɔ ɛno akyi.
This is a very important book.	Eyi yɛ nhoma a ɛho hia paa.
Something was obviously going on.	Ɛda adi sɛ na biribi rekɔ so.
Each of us will do that.	Yɛn mu biara bɛyɛ saa.
And no one can tell you where it is.	Na obiara ntumi nkyerɛ wo baabi a ɛwɔ.
He wrapped his arms around her.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne ho.
I have no idea what the problem is here.	Minnim ɔhaw a ɛwɔ ha no ho adwene biara.
A year has passed since then.	Afe biako atwam fi saa bere no.
The issue was difficult.	Ná asɛm no yɛ den.
It was a wonderful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Everyone wanted something from him.	Ná obiara pɛ biribi fi ne hɔ.
He has to give this his full attention.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde n’adwene nyinaa ma eyi.
They just never seemed to be quite as good.	Na ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ papa koraa da kɛkɛ.
But there was a big problem.	Nanso na ɔhaw kɛse bi wɔ hɔ.
The money really has to be invested.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde sika no to hɔ ankasa.
And you are never wrong.	Na wonyɛ mfomso da.
But that dog.	Nanso saa ɔkraman no.
So your father did that.	Enti wo papa yɛɛ saa.
They just don’t seem to care.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm kɛkɛ.
All types of vehicles will be provided.	Wɔde kar ahorow nyinaa bɛba.
But there is no problem with that.	Nanso ɔhaw biara nni saa asɛm no ho.
It is every right to price his goods as he pleases.	Ɛyɛ hokwan biara sɛ ɔde ne nneɛma bo sɛnea ɔpɛ biara.
He is with them now.	Ɔne wɔn wɔ hɔ mprempren.
His only child was my father.	Ná ne ba koro pɛ ne me papa.
It’s fun, but it’s a lot.	Ɛyɛ anigye, nanso ɛyɛ pii.
He didn't know what he was doing.	Ná onnim nea ɔyɛ.
He drove over her.	Ɔde kar kɔɔ ne so.
He thinks something is wrong.	Osusuw sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye.
I still couldn’t believe this was happening.	Ná meda so ara ntumi nnye nni sɛ eyi rekɔ so.
There was no one else.	Ná obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
There is always something.	Biribi wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
But he thinks it through.	Nanso osusuw ho yiye.
Everyone tee.	Obiara tee.
It’s just me here.	Ɛyɛ me nkutoo na mewɔ ha.
The time has finally come.	Bere no adu awiei koraa.
You need to do this every day.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi da biara da.
Their claim is false.	Wɔn asɛm no yɛ atoro.
No one saw him either.	Obiara nso anhu no.
People have sex on the phone, oral sex.	Nkurɔfo da wɔ telefon so, nna a wɔde ano ka.
I was pretty sure everyone knew.	Ná migye di yiye sɛ obiara nim.
Nor is anything new.	Saa ara nso na biribiara nyɛ foforo.
The picture was beautiful.	Ná mfonini no yɛ fɛ yiye.
It is their implementation that is more difficult.	Ɛyɛ wɔn a wɔde wɔn bedi dwuma no na ɛyɛ den sen saa.
It didn’t have to be exciting.	Ná enhia sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
His picture was in the paper last year.	Ná ne mfonini no wɔ krataa no mu afe a etwaam no.
Within the reach of my hands.	Wɔ baabi a me nsa betumi akɔ no mu.
But it’s a beautiful thing.	Nanso ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
They are used internally as well.	Wɔde di dwuma wɔ mu nso.
Which is fine by me.	Nea ɛyɛ papa wɔ me fam.
I did, however, do so.	Me de, meyɛɛ saa.
He didn’t have any.	Ná onni bi.
Not that it matters now.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛho hia mprempren.
I love how the characters take control.	M’ani gye sɛnea nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no fa so di tumi no ho.
Think of the kids!	Susuw mmofra no ho hwɛ!
This animal displays intelligence.	Saa aboa yi da nyansa adi.
He was not used to being touched.	Ná ɛnyɛ ne su sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa bɛka no.
Yours sure looks awesome.	Wo de no hwɛ hu sɛ ɛyɛ hu.
There was so much to do!	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ!
Importantly, there are many different types.	Nea ɛho hia ne sɛ, ahorow ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
I had a good thing going.	Ná mewɔ ade pa bi a ɛrekɔ so.
The excitement was totally mine.	Ná anigye no yɛ me de koraa.
If you want to be your true self.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ wo ho ankasa a.
We have a job here.	Yɛwɔ adwuma wɔ ha.
He looked even more like his father.	Ná ɔte sɛ ne papa kɛse mpo.
We don’t have to be perfect.	Ɛho nhia sɛ yɛyɛ pɛ.
We can see how that goes.	Yebetumi ahu sɛnea ɛno kɔ so.
Maybe you are that person who can help them.	Ebia wo ne saa onipa no a wubetumi aboa wɔn.
He had done all he could.	Ná wayɛ nea obetumi nyinaa.
The concept is very simple.	Adwene no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
This article did not have one.	Ná asɛm yi nni bi.
But you remember this, now.	Nanso wokae eyi, mprempren.
And he tells her like it is.	Na ɔka kyerɛ no sɛnea ɛte no.
I looked like a child.	Ná me ho te sɛ abofra.
His picture is in the book.	Ne mfonini no wɔ nhoma no mu.
We cannot discuss this here.	Yɛrentumi nka eyi ho asɛm wɔ ha.
I watch people all the time now.	Mehwɛ nkurɔfo bere nyinaa mprempren.
More would follow.	Ná pii foforo bɛba akyi.
First, it had to be intelligent.	Nea edi kan no, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea nyansa wom.
It’s also the city of music.	Ɛyɛ nnwom kurow no nso.
There are two types of these things.	Saa nneɛma yi ahorow abien na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I wanted to hurt him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ no yaw.
Everything as much as possible.	Biribiara sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye biara.
Yours should be a problem.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo de no yɛ ɔhaw.
That, too, works.	Ɛno nso yɛ adwuma.
We could talk about this all night if you wanted to.	Yebetumi aka eyi ho asɛm anadwo mũ no nyinaa sɛ wopɛ a.
That took a lot of work.	Ɛno gyee adwuma pii.
He had been shown a picture.	Ná wɔde mfonini akyerɛ no.
I can’t take it anywhere else.	Mintumi mfa nkɔ baabi foforo.
We could go with whatever story he wanted.	Ná yebetumi de asɛm biara a ɔpɛ akɔ.
There are many things here.	Nneɛma pii na ɛwɔ ha.
He knows something.	Onim biribi.
As much as he knew he didn’t.	Sɛnea na onim no na onnim.
I think in their own way they did.	Misusuw sɛ wɔ wɔn ankasa kwan so yɛɛ saa.
I didn’t like being taken away.	Ná m’ani nnye ho sɛ wɔde no bɛkɔ.
You will come here with us.	Wo ne yɛn bɛba ha.
But it was still a very important time for me.	Nanso na ɛda so ara yɛ bere a ɛho hia paa ma me.
I'm not that good at it.	Menyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw saa.
It’s a mistake.	Ɛyɛ mfomso.
Tell me something else.	Ka biribi foforo kyerɛ me.
I'm going to handle this.	Me na me bedi eyi ho dwuma.
I think, this is it.	Misusuw sɛ, eyi yɛ saa.
The plan was dangerous.	Ná asiane wɔ nhyehyɛe no mu.
Add as many as you like.	Fa pii ka ho sɛnea wopɛ.
I completely forgot.	Me werɛ fii koraa.
Please tell me now.	Mesrɛ wo ka kyerɛ me mprempren.
However, it doesn’t really matter.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ hwee ankasa.
It has a dog for every day of the year.	Ɛwɔ ɔkraman ma afe no mu da biara.
You can get it at the end.	Wubetumi anya no wɔ awiei no.
And the week after that.	Na dapɛn a edi ɛno akyi no.
That’s a problem.	Ɛno yɛ ɔhaw.
It would seem that way.	Ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛte saa.
That’s how he did it.	Saa na ɔyɛɛ saa.
He was out all day.	Ná ɔwɔ abɔnten da mũ no nyinaa.
I know, a terrible idea.	Minim, adwene a ɛyɛ hu.
I think that was a mistake.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno yɛ mfomso.
This immediately ensures that .	Eyi hwɛ hu ntɛm ara sɛ .
The atmosphere was exciting.	Ná tebea no yɛ anigye.
Melt.	Na ne.
He thought it was good.	Ná osusuw sɛ eye.
The task was not easy.	Ná adwuma no nyɛ mmerɛw.
It had happened.	Ná asi.
There are two of them.	Wɔn mu abien na ɛwɔ hɔ.
You are the best.	Wo na woyɛ papa sen biara.
The water was hot!	Ná nsu no yɛ hyew!
It’s a strong one.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
We all have that right.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ saa hokwan no.
And that’s obvious anyway.	Na ɛno da adi ɔkwan biara so.
That worked well, but it was a lot of work.	Ɛno yɛɛ adwuma yiye, nanso na ɛyɛ adwuma pii.
But it’s enough.	Nanso ɛdɔɔso.
Their last meeting had gone badly.	Ná wɔn nhyiam a etwa to no akɔ bɔne.
It was in his nature.	Ná ɛwɔ ne su mu.
You really have to think about the time you are given.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw bere a wɔde ama wo no ho ankasa.
And another, if necessary.	Na foforo nso, sɛ ɛho hia a.
So not much help.	Enti ɛnyɛ mmoa kɛse.
And it was a consensus.	Na ɛyɛ adwene koro.
I’m not the only one who thinks so.	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na misusuw saa.
The point comes in here.	Asɛm no ba wɔ ha.
The use of information comes.	Nsɛm a wɔde di dwuma no ba.
His father beat him.	Ne papa bɔɔ no.
In the end, it was too little, too late.	Awiei koraa no, na ɛyɛ kakraa bi dodo, na aka akyi dodo.
Everyone was impressed.	Obiara ani gyee ne ho.
That we all need it.	Sɛ yɛn nyinaa hia.
After all, he was just a boy.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na ɔyɛ abarimaa bi kɛkɛ.
However, this party was short-lived.	Nanso, na saa apontow yi nkwa nna yɛ tiaa.
There is something you need to know.	Biribi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
And children, too.	Na mmofra nso.
I was blown away by the beauty of the dress.	Sɛnea atade no yɛ fɛ no maa me ho dwiriw me.
As you know, many years have passed since then.	Sɛnea wunim no, saa bere no mfe pii atwam.
Nothing was supposed to be like that.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ biribiara yɛ saa.
It’s definitely one of those two.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ saa abien no mu biako.
Describe his car in detail.	Ka ne kar no ho asɛm kɔ akyiri.
There was nothing more to do here.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ bio wɔ ha.
It’s that it’s easy.	Ɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Expensive, very impressive.	Ne bo yɛ den, ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
I thought it was something like that.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
Some good stuff.	Nneɛma pa bi.
They are strong.	Wɔyɛ den.
Don’t have that!	Nni saa!
At least you will if you hurry.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wobɛyɛ saa sɛ woyɛ ntɛm a.
I understand completely.	Mete ase koraa.
No one can tell you when either.	Obiara nso ntumi nka bere bɛn nkyerɛ wo.
Many children are involved.	Mmofra pii ka ho.
The same is true here.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ ha nso.
Who is doing the talking?	Hena na ɔreyɛ kasa no?
Not bad, easy to use, and good for this guy.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne, ɛnyɛ den sɛ wode bedi dwuma, na eye ma saa ɔbarima yi.
And it’s hard.	Na ɛyɛ den.
Only for a short time.	Bere tiaa bi pɛ.
He wanted a comfortable bed.	Ná ɔpɛ mpa a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I wasn’t really happy.	Ná m’ani nnye ankasa.
However, it is not for me.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ me fam.
They are expensive.	Wɔn bo yɛ den.
No one really knows what to do.	Obiara nnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ankasa.
There are no residuals.	Nneɛma a aka biara nni hɔ.
Don’t think it’s a bad thing, though.	Nanso, nsusuw sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne.
Time to work hard.	Bere a wɔde yɛ adwuma denneennen.
I put it down.	Mede too fam.
There must be an error.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mfomso bi ba.
And maybe he did.	Na ebia ɔyɛɛ saa.
I would have done that.	Anka mɛyɛ saa.
Your pictures are wonderful.	Wo mfonini ahorow no yɛ nwonwa.
It wasn’t great.	Ná ɛnyɛ kɛse.
Some things show, and he liked it.	Nneɛma bi kyerɛ, na n’ani gyee ho.
This is a good news.	Eyi yɛ asɛm pa.
I only know their names.	Wɔn din nkutoo na minim.
But it’s not this.	Nanso ɛnyɛ eyi.
No one believes me.	Obiara nnye me nni.
There was no other opportunity.	Ná hokwan foforo biara nni hɔ.
So we can’t say it’s anything.	Enti yɛrentumi nka sɛ ɛyɛ hwee.
He seems to like your mother, and gets along with her.	Ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye wo maame ho, na ɔne no di yiye.
This is usually a temporary situation.	Eyi taa yɛ bere tiaa mu tebea.
He was a beautiful child.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Something has come to an end.	Biribi aba awiei.
Sounds like a great deal to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ade kɛse ma me.
What it was.	Nea na ɛyɛ.
I thought that was a wonderful thing to say.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛsɛ sɛ meka.
But so do you in yours.	Nanso saa ara na wo nso woyɛ wɔ wo de mu.
You should have seen me, though.	Nanso, anka ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu me.
How was your day today?	Wo da no yɛɛ dɛn nnɛ?
And you have to do that.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I could hardly believe it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
He always lived in the suburbs.	Ná ɔte kurow no akyi bere nyinaa.
But it is very important.	Nanso ɛho hia paa.
After that, the table.	Ɛno akyi no, pon no.
On the one hand, that is obviously true.	Ɔkwan biako so no, ɛda adi sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
Man is a dog.	Onipa yɛ ɔkraman.
You know, like mine.	Wunim, te sɛ me de no.
However, his head was already there.	Nanso, na ne ti wɔ hɔ dedaw.
The snake was surprised by this.	Ɔwɔ no ho dwiriw no wɔ eyi ho.
I am the best.	Me na meyɛ nea eye sen biara.
The boy walked up to her.	Abarimaa no nantew baa ne nkyɛn.
Maybe not so well.	Ebia ɛnyɛ yiye saa.
There was enough time for that later.	Ná bere a ɛdɔɔso wɔ hɔ ma ɛno akyiri yi.
That’s the other half.	Ɛno ne fã a aka no.
The price doesn’t show.	Bo no ntumi nkyerɛ.
Remove and keep warm.	Yi na ma ɛnyɛ hyew.
No one else can do it for you.	Obi foforo biara ntumi nyɛ mma wo.
He gives it away for free.	Ɔde ma kwa.
It was your mother.	Ná ɛyɛ wo maame.
He is with her.	Ɔne no wɔ hɔ.
I am working on the same thing now.	Mereyɛ ade koro no ara ho adwuma mprempren.
I think you are one of the good guys.	Misusuw sɛ woyɛ nnipa pa no mu biako.
I wanted us to come up with something new.	Ná mepɛ sɛ yɛde biribi foforo ba.
I couldn’t get enough, of him.	Na mintumi nnya nea ɛdɔɔso, ne ho.
You have to treat me right, not the other way around.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ me yiye, na ɛnyɛ ɔkwan foforo so.
This surprised me greatly.	Eyi yɛɛ me nwonwa yiye.
He wasn’t the only one who had sinned here.	Ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na na wayɛ bɔne wɔ ha.
It will be great.	Ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
The participant must sign in manually.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nea ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu no de ne nsa hyɛ mu.
His speech was hours long.	Ná ne kasa no tenten yɛ nnɔnhwerew pii.
But, again, maybe not.	Nanso, bio, ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
It is a positive evil.	Ɛyɛ bɔne a ɛyɛ papa a wɔyɛ.
This might be interesting after all.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ anigye wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
It’s so nice.	Ɛte saa.
It seemed cold.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea awɔw wom.
In a way, it seemed unnecessary.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia.
This girl was very beautiful.	Ná abeawa yi ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
If not, who knows.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, hena na onim.
It’s an absolute must.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ koraa.
The drought of the last few years.	Ɔpɛ a asi wɔ mfe kakraa a atwam no mu.
And this book is definitely interesting.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nhoma yi yɛ anigye.
It doesn’t exist.	Ɛnyɛ hɔ.
Consider the severity of the problem.	Susuw sɛnea ɔhaw no mu yɛ den no ho hwɛ.
And we could go on all day.	Na yebetumi akɔ so da mũ nyinaa.
Both of these seem to work.	Ɛte sɛ nea saa abien yi nyinaa yɛ adwuma.
This should be updated annually.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi foforo afe biara.
I saw you.	Mihuu wo.
Children should run after each other instead of playing alone.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra tu mmirika di wɔn ho wɔn ho akyi sen sɛ wɔn nkutoo bedi agoru.
His plan wasn’t working.	Ná ne nhyehyɛe no ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
You can’t see the details.	Worentumi nhu nsɛm no mu nsɛm.
That’s a staggering number.	Ɛno yɛ dodow a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I'm not sure what this error says.	Me nnim nea saa mfomso yi ka.
This shouldn’t take too long.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi gye bere tenten pii.
But let me know if you have anything to add.	Nanso sɛ wowɔ biribi a wode bɛka ho a, kyerɛ me.
His eyes were fixed on her.	N’ani kyerɛɛ no.
But this book sounds like good stuff to me.	Nanso nhoma yi te sɛ nneɛma pa ma me.
He knew his past was still a part of him.	Ná onim sɛ nea atwam no da so ara yɛ ne fã.
Give it a look below.	Ma no hwɛ wɔ ase hɔ.
I don’t want to cause you any more trouble.	Mempɛ sɛ mede ɔhaw bi bɛba wo so bio.
And so it is with money.	Na saa ara na ɛte wɔ sika ho.
Your hair looks really nice today.	Wo ti nhwi yɛ fɛ ankasa nnɛ.
Why is it so slow? 	Dɛn nti na ɛte saa?
Take care of animals.	Hwɛ mmoa yiye.
He was hers for life.	Ná ɔyɛ ne de nkwa nna nyinaa.
He told everyone that this doesn’t work for kids.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ obiara sɛ eyi nyɛ adwuma mma mmofra.
It has been my privilege to work with him.	Ayɛ me hokwan sɛ me ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
Our schools are in trouble.	Yɛn sukuu ahorow no wɔ ɔhaw mu.
Or is it still on.	Anaasɛ ɛda so ara wɔ so.
Anyway, it didn’t matter.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
He’s like you.	Ɔte sɛ wo.
Take good care of your animals.	Hwɛ wo mmoa yiye.
She was practically wet.	Ná ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ne ho ayɛ nsu.
Another important thing you want is.	Ade foforo a ɛho hia a wopɛ ne.
I've just gotten used to it.	Mede ayɛ me su ara kwa.
He is not a living person.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ɔte ase.
Too many don’t.	Pii dodo no nyɛ saa.
But there are many things we can do.	Nanso nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ.
It’s to have fun.	Ɛyɛ sɛ wɔde begye wɔn ani.
And maybe only two at that.	Na ebia abien pɛ na ɛwɔ saa asɛm no mu.
So, it’s the best.	Enti, eye sen biara.
You weren’t sure if you could help with these two issues.	Na wunnim sɛ ebia wubetumi aboa wɔ nsɛm abien yi ho anaa.
Or that we are all the same.	Anaasɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
This is what his father tried to tell him.	Eyi ne nea ne papa bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛka akyerɛ no.
This can happen at any time.	Eyi betumi asi bere biara.
The good man returns.	Onipa pa no san ba.
There is something here for everyone.	Biribi wɔ ha ma obiara.
However, something very strange was happening.	Nanso, na biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye rekɔ so.
There is no danger.	Asiane biara nni hɔ.
I seem to feel his presence warm around me.	Ɛte sɛ nea mete nka sɛ ne ba a ɔwɔ hɔ no yɛ hyew wɔ me ho.
Thanks again for all your help.	Meda wo ase bio wɔ mo mmoa nyinaa ho.
Maybe it will work.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
Or they were, for someone, somewhere.	Anaasɛ na wɔyɛ, wɔ obi fam no, baabi.
I love their work.	M’ani gye wɔn adwuma no ho.
Many people don’t know how powerful he is.	Nnipa pii nnim sɛnea ɔwɔ tumi.
He says what he knows.	Ɔka nea onim.
Whatever it was, it wasn’t food.	Nea na ɛyɛ biara no, na ɛnyɛ aduan.
At home.	Wɔ fie.
In the latter case, both systems are ideal.	Wɔ asɛm a etwa to no mu no, nhyehyɛe abien no nyinaa yɛ nea eye.
The matter was getting complicated.	Ná asɛm no reyɛ den.
That has been going on for a long time.	Ɛno akɔ so bere tenten ni.
This will take a very long time.	Eyi begye bere tenten paa.
Not so, my friends.	Ɛnte saa, me nnamfo.
I feel like it’s hurting me.	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ me yaw.
I know what he would do.	Minim nea anka ɔbɛyɛ.
He can say whatever he wants.	Obetumi aka nea ɔpɛ biara.
He's a really bad guy.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ bɔne ankasa.
That’s what you tell yourself.	Ɛno ne nea woka kyerɛ wo ho.
I am not feeling well anymore.	Me ho nyɛ me den bio.
It’s not enough.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
Somehow we put ourselves down.	Ɔkwan bi so no yɛde yɛn ho to fam.
I get along well with all of them.	Me ne wɔn nyinaa bɔ yiye.
And that’s what it’s going to be.	Na ɛno na ɛbɛyɛ.
I liked that story.	M’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho.
This was never something he thought he wanted.	Ná eyi nyɛ ade a na osusuw sɛ ɔpɛ da.
Don’t let me do it.	Mma menyɛ.
But they are less important this time.	Nanso wɔn ho nhia kɛse saa bere yi.
In other words, it’s a little easier.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛyɛ mmerɛw kakra.
If it was common.	Sɛ na abu so a.
We cannot and should not.	Yɛrentumi na ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
It’s all on their terms.	Ne nyinaa wɔ wɔn nsɛm so.
It got bigger every year.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse afe biara.
This is a great opportunity.	Eyi yɛ hokwan kɛse.
I’m in love with him.	M’ani gyee ne ho.
I want more information on that.	Mepɛ nsɛm pii fa saa asɛm no ho.
However, there are several problems with this approach.	Nanso, ɔhaw ahorow pii wɔ saa kwan yi so.
Do something else.	Yɛ biribi foforo.
Can someone please help me with this.	Mesrɛ obi betumi aboa me wɔ eyi ho.
I've got to work you into it.	Me deɛ, ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ wo adwuma wɔ mu.
You too .	Wo nso .
There was no back door.	Ná akyi pon biara nni hɔ.
I want it to be obvious.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛda adi.
He was definitely the most interesting.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔno na n’ani gye ho sen biara.
Like your father and mother.	Te sɛ wo papa ne wo maame.
We would do it every day.	Ná yɛbɛyɛ no da biara da.
He was in trouble.	Ná ɔwɔ ɔhaw mu.
That was part of what we relied on.	Ná ɛno yɛ nea yɛde yɛn ho to so no fã.
But we would be wrong.	Nanso anka yɛbɛyɛ mfomso.
You’ve done half of it.	Woayɛ no fã.
More information will be added over time.	Bere kɔ so no, wɔde nsɛm pii bɛka ho.
And amazing things did happen.	Na nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii ampa.
That man had to go on the road.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ saa ɔbarima no kɔ kwan no so.
He is afraid	Ɔbɔ hu .
It’s nice when someone says thank you for a good job.	Sɛ obi ka sɛ meda wo ase wɔ adwuma pa a woayɛ ho a, ɛyɛ anigye.
You are the target.	Wo ne nea wɔde wɔn ani asi so.
You can find out more about it here.	Wubetumi ahu ho nsɛm pii wɔ ha.
He lives there every day.	Ɔte hɔ da biara da.
I want to talk about you.	Mepɛ sɛ meka wo ho asɛm.
We had to risk everything.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde biribiara to asiane mu.
I have something important to tell you.	Mewɔ biribi a ɛho hia a mɛka akyerɛ wo.
Walk fast!	Nantew ntɛmntɛm!
So you have to be realistic about that.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ obi ankasa wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
It’s been a long time.	Ɛyɛ bere tenten.
Children these days!.	Mmofra nnansa yi!.
Not in any way, not at any time.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan biara so, ɛnyɛ bere biara.
You need to add at least one.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ wode biako ka ho.
I’m really excited to give it to him.	M’ani agye ankasa sɛ mede bɛma no.
The mind is very powerful.	Adwene no wɔ tumi kɛse.
This weekend will be tough.	Saa dapɛn awiei yi bɛyɛ den.
We are the people who exist.	Yɛyɛ nnipa a yɛwɔ hɔ.
Nor did he, of course.	Saa ara nso na ɔno nso anyɛ saa, ampa.
He had nothing to say to her.	Ná onni asɛm biara a ɔbɛka akyerɛ no.
Everyone is a success.	Obiara yɛ obi a odi yiye.
They owed their creditors a lot of money.	Ná wɔde sika pii ka wɔn a wɔde wɔn ka no.
His eyes began to water.	N’ani fii ase yɛɛ nsu.
Again, just my opinion.	Bio nso, m’adwene ara kwa.
The man was wearing a shirt and tie.	Ná ɔbarima no hyɛ atade ne krataa.
He has shaved his head too.	Ɔno nso abɔ ne ti nhwi.
At least that is the case.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na ɛte.
We can do little by ourselves.	Yɛn ankasa ntumi nyɛ ade kɛse biara.
They are all here!	Wɔn nyinaa wɔ ha!
I love you, boy.	M’ani gye wo ho, abarimaa.
Is there anyone there?	So obi wɔ hɔ?
What matters is what you do about the problem.	Nea ɛho hia ne nea woyɛ wɔ ɔhaw no ho.
This has been going on for almost two years.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ eyi akɔ so mfe abien ni.
He is not weak.	Ɔnyɛ mmerɛw.
This wasn’t just sex.	Ná eyi nyɛ nna ara kwa.
It was too late to go home.	Ná aka akyi dodo sɛ mɛkɔ fie.
I couldn’t even figure out what most of these things were.	Na mintumi nhu nea saa nneɛma yi mu dodow no ara yɛ mpo.
It’s not me.	Ɛnyɛ me.
No one even did that.	Obiara mpo anyɛ saa.
How beautiful she was.	Hwɛ sɛnea na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I know the city well.	Minim kurow no yiye.
I thought this was interesting too.	Misusuwii sɛ eyi nso yɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
It’s your habit.	Ɛyɛ wo su.
They have difficulty concentrating.	Ɛyɛ den ma wɔn sɛ wɔde wɔn adwene besi biribi so.
Without any order.	A nhyehyɛe biara nni mu.
But the game went on.	Nanso agoru no kɔɔ so ara.
Exactly what that means is unclear at the moment.	Nea ɛno kyerɛ ankasa no mu nna hɔ mprempren.
He knew her, after all.	Ná onim no, ne nyinaa akyi no.
The thing is, he wanted me to.	Asɛm no ne sɛ na ɔpɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
Otherwise, it’s free.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛyɛ kwa.
Steam comes out of the hot medium.	Nsu a ɛyɛ hyew fi ade a ɛyɛ hyew no mu ba.
Surely this had to be a lie.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ atoro.
I knew that.	Ná minim saa.
I have no one else to help me.	Minni obi foforo a ɔbɛboa me.
And so does the.	Na saa ara nso na.
This does not seem to be the case.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi nte saa.
He seemed to be new.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wayɛ foforo.
I am sure you will.	Migye di sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
And that’s all, absolutely all.	Na ɛno ara ne ne nyinaa, ne nyinaa koraa.
Many people showed up.	Nnipa pii baa wɔn ho adi.
Part of me felt bad.	Na me fã bi te nka bɔne.
The children's drawings were simple, but beautiful.	Ná mmofra no mfonini ahorow no nyɛ den, nanso na ɛyɛ fɛ.
It is in very nice condition.	Ɛwɔ tebea a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye mu.
But the situation is very difficult.	Nanso tebea no mu yɛ den yiye.
They talk about his clothes.	Wɔka ne ntade ho asɛm.
It was books.	Ná ɛyɛ nhoma ahorow.
A table is set up.	Wɔde pon bi to hɔ.
He thought we could be friends.	Ná osusuw sɛ yebetumi ayɛ nnamfo.
He had the house.	Ná ɔwɔ fie no.
This would have taken hours.	Anka eyi begye nnɔnhwerew pii.
Somehow, though, it does.	Nanso, ɔkwan bi so no, ɛyɛ saa.
Maybe go a little further with some interest.	Ebia kɔ akyiri kakra a ɛwɔ anigye bi.
And if it works, it works.	Na sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a, ɛyɛ adwuma.
It was never anything this terrible.	Na ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ hu saa da.
And so is the dog.	Na saa ara na ɔkraman no nso te.
I see it happening more and more.	Mihu sɛ ɛrekɔ so kɛse.
The results are below.	Nea afi mu aba no wɔ ase ha.
I am sure many people will enjoy this.	Migye di sɛ nnipa pii ani begye eyi ho.
That’s definitely my opinion.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛno ne m’adwene.
The city was full of music today.	Ná nnwom ahyɛ kurow no mu ma nnɛ.
Like any child.	Te sɛ abofra biara.
What kind of music do you like?	Nnwom bɛn na w’ani gye ho?
You, boy.	Wo, abarimaa.
But even if it is true.	Nanso sɛ ɛyɛ nokware mpo a.
You can have one without the other.	Wubetumi anya biako a biako no nka ho.
I feel a bit numb.	Mete nka sɛ me ho ayɛ me hyew kakra.
You get what you work for.	Wo nsa ka nea woyɛ adwuma ma no.
He has a plan.	Ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe bi.
But there is a problem with thinking.	Nanso ɔhaw bi wɔ adwene a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho mu.
Time is money.	Bere yɛ sika.
He would go when his time came.	Ná ɔbɛkɔ bere a ne bere adu no.
Thank you for that.	Meda mo ase wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
We hope that it is.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
Just remove it.	Yi fi hɔ ara kwa.
Almost the time of the month.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔsram no mu bere.
Everyone has their own opinion.	Obiara wɔ n’adwene.
It was a good business trip.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma pa a wɔde tu kwan.
Fill to the brim.	Fa hyɛ mu ma kosi ano.
It was a wonderful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Commit to the tests.	Bɔ wo ho mu ma sɔhwɛ ahorow no.
Do your best to do it.	Yɛ nea wubetumi biara.
The hours are long.	Nnɔnhwerew no yɛ tenten.
Look at what's going on here.	Hwɛ nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha.
One time out of three, it works that way.	Bere biako wɔ abiɛsa mu no, ɛyɛ adwuma saa.
Better in my opinion.	Nea eye sen saa wɔ m’adwene mu.
He had work in the morning.	Ná ɔwɔ adwuma anɔpa.
It’s the happy ending.	Ɛyɛ anigye awiei no.
I don’t care what it looks like.	Sɛnea ɛte no mfa me ho.
So much had happened in the last week and a half.	Enti na nneɛma pii asi wɔ dapɛn biako ne fã a atwam no mu.
He did so several times.	Ɔyɛɛ saa mpɛn pii.
Almost all of us found this to be untrue.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa hui sɛ eyi nyɛ nokware.
We need to work on it carefully.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho adwuma yiye.
I don’t really think of it as such.	Minsusuw ho sɛ ɛte saa ankasa.
There would be no money for new clothes or accessories.	Anka sika biara nni hɔ mma ntade foforo anaa nneɛma a wɔde yɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ.
He touched her hand.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne nsa.
Something strange is happening.	Biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa rekɔ so.
You can go further if you want.	Wubetumi akɔ akyiri sɛ wopɛ a.
My first and last and only one.	Me nea edi kan ne nea etwa to ne nea ɛyɛ biako pɛ.
It gets bigger every year.	Ɛyɛ kɛse afe biara.
The whole gun thing brings me to the point.	Tuo asɛm no nyinaa de me ba asɛm no so.
He doesn’t really do these things himself.	Ɔno ankasa nyɛ saa nneɛma yi ankasa.
Do it right if you can.	Yɛ no yiye sɛ wubetumi a.
Photographic illustrations.	Mfonini a wɔde mfonini ayɛ.
He had to exercise self-control.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ odi ne ho so.
For me, there was no such thing.	Wɔ me fam no, na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
I am still filled with hope.	Anidaso da so ara ahyɛ me ma.
Boy, it would be nice if there was, though.	Abarimaa, sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ a, anka ɛbɛyɛ papa, nanso.
To bring this life into that one.	Sɛ wode saa nkwa yi bɛba saa biako no mu.
In.	Mu.
Do you want a hand with that?	So wopɛ nsa a ɛwɔ saa?
That is a very good idea.	Ɛno yɛ adwene a eye paa.
He knew he didn't have to.	Ná onim sɛ enhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
He has to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Conceived and designed the study.	Ɔyɛɛ adesua no ho adwene ne nhyehyɛe no.
Besides it was too hard for him.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a na ɛyɛ den dodo ma no.
I want to know.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu.
He could have done it.	Ná obetumi ayɛ.
It still has no interest.	Ɛda so ara nni anigye biara.
She kicked him with her bare feet.	Ɔde ne nan a ɛda hɔ kwa no bɔɔ no.
At home, at school.	Wɔ fie, wɔ sukuu mu.
It is, what it is.	Ɛyɛ, nea ɛyɛ.
I don’t want to be there.	Mempɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ.
The man's face was working.	Ná ɔbarima no anim reyɛ adwuma.
Every single job.	Adwuma biako biara.
He snuggled up, smothering himself.	Ɔde ne ho bɔɔ mu, na ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ ne ho so.
This is another one of these things.	Eyi yɛ saa nneɛma yi mu foforo.
Someone knocked on the downstairs door.	Obi bɔɔ ɔpon a ɛwɔ fam hɔ no mu.
They are really strong.	Wɔyɛ den ankasa.
He's happy, even if he says he's not.	Ɔwɔ anigye, sɛ ɔka sɛ ɔnyɛ saa mpo a.
Why do you think this happened?	Wususuw sɛ dɛn nti na eyi sii?
He spent hours and hours on it.	Ɔde nnɔnhwerew ne nnɔnhwerew pii yɛɛ ho adwuma.
I know all about cars.	Minim kar ho nsɛm nyinaa.
But the great thing is this.	Nanso ade kɛse no ne eyi.
That time has passed.	Saa bere no atwam.
Look where they put him.	Hwɛ baabi a wɔde no too hɔ no.
Not just any water though.	Ɛnyɛ nsu biara kɛkɛ de, nanso.
Most of these species were gregarious.	Ná saa mmoa ahorow yi mu dodow no ara yɛ kuw.
Or at least there probably is.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ebia ɛwɔ hɔ.
They are really quick and easy.	Wɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm na ɛnyɛ den ankasa.
We literally feed each other.	Yɛyɛ yɛn ho yɛn ho aduan ankasa.
Otherwise he does nothing.	Anyɛ saa a ɔnyɛ hwee.
The same was true of the past.	Saa ara na na ɛte kan no.
But there was little of that.	Nanso na ɛno mu kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
They don’t work well alone.	Wɔn nkutoo nyɛ adwuma yiye.
It’s just what you have.	Ɛyɛ nea wowɔ ara kwa.
It was a real pleasure to work with him.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye ankasa sɛ me ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
But that is a mistake.	Nanso ɛno yɛ mfomso.
However, we can say more.	Nanso, yebetumi aka pii.
He loves doing things with our kids and doing things with them.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne yɛn mma yɛ nneɛma na ɔde yɛ nneɛma nso.
Think about it.	Susuw ho hwɛ.
These words seem familiar but new.	Ɛte sɛ nea nsɛm yi nim nanso ɛyɛ foforo.
You can’t control it.	Worentumi nni so.
It’s still there.	Ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
Fold in the remaining ingredients.	Fa nneɛma a aka no bɔ mu.
It used to be very popular.	Kan no na nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse.
The day lives another day.	Da no tra ase da foforo.
You can try to see if that works.	Wubetumi abɔ mmɔden ahwɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ adwuma anaa.
I have a lot of musical tastes.	Mewɔ nnwom ahorow pii a m’ani gye ho.
I want to know what happens next.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea edi hɔ.
Assume this is the case.	Fa no sɛ eyi te saa.
I still think it’s a dress.	Meda so ara susuw sɛ ɛyɛ atade.
I was terrible in it.	Ná me ho yɛ hu wɔ mu.
I'll do it for you.	Me deɛ, mɛyɛ no ama wo.
But this time, that will be difficult.	Nanso saa bere yi de, ɛno bɛyɛ den.
I would agree with that.	Me ne saa adwene no bɛyɛ adwene.
I combed my hair.	Mede me ti nhwi yɛɛ me ti nhwi.
I love being a mom.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ maame.
The rest is not so easy.	Nea aka no nyɛ mmerɛw saa.
That was really about it.	Ná ɛno fa ho ankasa.
The good news is.	Asɛm pa no.
Someone out there is concerned.	Obi a ɔwɔ abɔnten hɔ no haw.
You can’t do that with this.	Worentumi mfa eyi nyɛ saa.
I was their first day.	Ná meyɛ wɔn da a edi kan no.
He was good to her and a good person.	Ná ɔyɛ papa ma no na na ɔyɛ onipa pa.
It’s what you do.	Ɛyɛ nea woyɛ.
He is always late for classes.	Ɔka akyi wɔ adesua mu bere nyinaa.
It shouldn’t be easy by any means.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw ɔkwan biara so.
The first half of that movie is great.	Saa sini no fã a edi kan no yɛ kɛse.
He wasn't going to give her that power.	Ná ɔnyɛ sɛ ɔde saa tumi no bɛma no.
What a terrible day!	Da a ɛyɛ hu bɛn ara ni!
I have to hear it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete.
It had ended last week.	Ná aba awiei dapɛn a etwaam no.
No one can do it for us.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ mma yɛn.
I knew he was trouble.	Ná minim sɛ ɔyɛ ɔhaw.
But he can only go on what is offered.	Nanso nea wɔde ma nkutoo na obetumi akɔ so.
That is the reason, he is, where he is today.	Ɛno ne nea enti a, ɔte, baabi a ɔwɔ nnɛ.
The tests will get harder with each new year, .	Sɔhwɛ ahorow no bɛyɛ den kɛse wɔ afe foforo biara mu, .
That would be very bad.	Ɛno bɛyɛ bɔne paa.
A little you know better.	Kakra a wunim no yiye.
He loved every genre of music.	Ná n’ani gye nnwom ahorow biara a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho.
There is no human being who does not.	Onipa biara nni hɔ a ɔnyɛ saa.
I wouldn't want you to touch me.	Anka mempɛ sɛ wo nsa bɛka me.
We have our hands on it.	Yɛwɔ yɛn nsa.
Don’t make it so hard on yourself.	Mma ɛnyɛ den mma wo ho saa.
She is a very nice person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I could do my talking from there.	Ná metumi afi hɔ ayɛ me kasa no.
I just need to figure out what it is.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛyɛ ara kwa.
I think this whole thing goes way back.	Misusuw sɛ asɛm yi nyinaa kɔ akyiri koraa.
Be genuine, true and genuine.	Yɛ nokware, nokware ne nokware.
And it was still too late.	Na na ɛda so ara aka akyi dodo.
But, don’t sleep.	Nanso, mma wo nna.
She was a beautiful girl.	Ná ɔyɛ abeawa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
The words were filled with joy.	Anigye hyɛɛ nsɛm no ma.
And it only exists now.	Na mprempren nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
So this is easy.	Enti eyi yɛ mmerɛw.
My car went off the road.	Me kar no fii kwan no so.
The idea is a simple one.	Adwene no yɛ ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I’m not alone, though.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ me nkutoo de.
I might be in grave danger.	Ebia na mewɔ asiane kɛse mu.
It seems pretty obvious to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛda adi yiye ma me.
Then start using it.	Saa bere no na fi ase de di dwuma no.
Tonight, he had another plan.	Anadwo yi, na ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe foforo.
The man was very strong.	Ná ɔbarima no ho yɛ den yiye.
As if someone had programmed them like that.	Te sɛ nea obi ayɛ wɔn nhyehyɛe saa.
My picture is not as good as yours.	Me mfonini no nyɛ papa te sɛ wo de no.
Maybe they’ve forgotten me.	Ebia wɔn werɛ afi me.
He’s a great kid.	Ɔyɛ abofra kɛse.
I think the simpler the better.	Misusuw sɛ dodow a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no dodow no ara na ɛbɛyɛ papa.
Only today, though.	Nanso, nnɛ nkutoo de.
He’s in the car.	Ɔno wɔ kar no mu.
Take the time.	Di bere.
The test will come today.	Sɔhwɛ no bɛba nnɛ.
But they shouldn’t have done that.	Nanso anka ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Just what they don’t care about.	Nea ɛho nhia wɔn ara kwa.
I would be happy with anything.	Anka m’ani begye wɔ biribiara ho.
The other leg was just lying on the ground.	Ná nan foforo no da fam ara kwa.
Almost no one knew about you.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na obiara nnim wo ho asɛm.
If you’re not happy, do something about it.	Sɛ w’ani nnye a, yɛ ho biribi.
The truth mattered.	Ná nokware no ho hia.
Otherwise, I would keep going.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, anka mɛkɔ so ayɛ saa.
But in this important one, it is.	Nanso wɔ nea ɛho hia yi mu no, ɛte saa.
Everything just seemed to be working fine.	Na te sɛ nea biribiara reyɛ adwuma yiye ara kwa.
However, he may have been another man.	Nanso, ebia na ɔyɛ ɔbarima foforo.
That’s what you told me.	Ɛno ne nea woka kyerɛɛ me.
He was not the majority.	Ná ɔnyɛ nnipa dodow no ara.
Please go, now.	Mesrɛ wo kɔ, mprempren.
However, this is not always the case.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na eyi te saa.
There are many people.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ.
We also had one of those.	Ná yɛwɔ saa nneɛma no mu biako nso.
And so did everyone else.	Na obiara a aka no nso yɛɛ saa.
I think he needs to be told what is going on.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka nea ɛrekɔ so no kyerɛ no.
They are also new.	Wɔn nso yɛ foforo.
I can see why people like them so much.	Mihu nea enti a nkurɔfo pɛ wɔn saa no.
Do you have a dog?	So wowɔ ɔkraman?
There are many jobs available.	Nnwuma pii wɔ hɔ a wɔyɛ.
However, I cannot see him.	Nanso, mintumi nhu no.
I want you now.	Mepɛ wo seesei.
We are such a good team.	Yɛyɛ kuw pa saa.
He is quick enough.	Ɔyɛ ntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I look at it carefully.	Mehwɛ mu yiye.
It is a very difficult task.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den yiye.
If he does, rejoice in one another.	Sɛ ɔyɛ saa a, momma mo ani nnye mo ho mo ho.
A few years ago, there was only one option.	Mfe kakraa bi a atwam ni no, na ɔkwan biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
It’s been a week.	Ɛyɛ dapɛn biako ni.
He was always busy.	Ná onni adagyew bere nyinaa.
Two and a half days.	Nna abien ne fã.
How hard it is to actually tell this to someone else.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka eyi akyerɛ obi foforo ankasa.
It is something you can see with your own eyes.	Ɛyɛ biribi a wubetumi de w’ani ahu.
This all sounds old fashioned.	Eyi nyinaa te sɛ dedaw kwan so.
I kind of like that about a girl.	M’ani gye saa wɔ abeawa bi ho wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
Maybe he hit her with something.	Ebia ɔde biribi bɔɔ no.
To me, she is wonderful and so are her friends.	Wɔ me fam no, ɔyɛ nwonwa na ne nnamfo nso yɛ nwonwa.
Everyone has a story to tell.	Obiara wɔ asɛm bi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka.
That was the way it was.	Saa na na ɛte.
You can’t beat it.	Worentumi nni so nkonim.
But be aware that this can cause some production issues.	Nanso hu sɛ eyi betumi de nsɛm bi aba sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
That will take some time.	Ɛno begye bere kakra.
It was a great moment.	Ná ɛyɛ bere kɛse.
I know that’s not good.	Minim sɛ ɛno nyɛ papa.
I don’t know what the first one is.	Minnim nea edi kan no yɛ.
He painted the most beautiful pictures.	Ɔyɛɛ mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ sen biara.
This was a huge mistake.	Ná eyi yɛ mfomso kɛse.
There is never enough money at the end of the month.	Sika a ɛdɔɔso nni ɔsram no awiei da.
Anyway.	Ɛnyɛ hwee.
Water is thicker than solid.	Nsu yɛ kɛse sen ade a ɛyɛ den.
It’s not really that surprising.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa saa ankasa.
This is a great house.	Eyi yɛ ofie kɛse bi.
Can anyone help me with this.	So obi betumi aboa me wɔ eyi ho.
The performance was fantastic.	Ná agoru no yɛ nwonwa.
This is not a danger.	Eyi nyɛ asiane.
It doesn’t have to be.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ.
I have the opportunity to reach more people.	Mewɔ hokwan a mede bɛkɔ nnipa pii nkyɛn.
But he parked his car.	Nanso ɔde ne kar sii hɔ.
It was every man for himself.	Na ɛyɛ onipa biara ma ne ho.
He was under the window.	Ná ɔwɔ mfɛnsere no ase.
You’ve done it right.	Woayɛ no yiye.
It is not true at all.	Ɛnyɛ nokware koraa.
Like you're part of it or something.	Te sɛ nea woyɛ ne fã anaa biribi.
It was good, but not great.	Ná eye, nanso na ɛnyɛ kɛse.
Think about it carefully.	Susuw ho yiye.
This door needs painting.	Saa ɔpon yi hia sɛ wɔyɛ mfonini.
You don’t know his name.	Wunnim ne din.
We have a number of friends who work there.	Yɛwɔ nnamfo dodow bi a wɔyɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ.
But you can point the way.	Nanso wubetumi akyerɛ kwan.
Maybe that’s what this is about.	Ebia ɛno ne nea eyi fa ho.
Maybe he snapped it up.	Ebia ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ mu.
I thought there must be something ‘wrong’ with me.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ biribi ‘mfomso’ bi wɔ me ho.
There was a problem.	Ná ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
There is no squirrel.	Ɔkraman biara nni hɔ.
A few days ago.	Nna kakraa bi a atwam ni.
They don’t really care.	Ɛho nhia wɔn ankasa.
That’s what they tell me.	Saa na wɔka kyerɛ me.
And you should do the same.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ saa.
He’s been very excited about it.	N’ani agye ho yiye.
It’s time to act.	Ɛyɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ade.
He knows the man better than anyone.	Onim ɔbarima no yiye sen obiara.
So this is what it looks like.	Enti eyi ne sɛnea ɛte.
This was not the way.	Na eyi nyɛ ɔkwan no.
It was never true.	Ná ɛnyɛ nokware da.
I am only halfway through the meal.	Meyɛ aduan no fã pɛ.
You’re hot.	Wo ho yɛ hyew.
The first is raw materials.	Nea edi kan ne nneɛma a wɔde yɛ nneɛma foforo.
I will add a couple of things.	Mede nneɛma abien bi bɛka ho.
All old, now.	Ne nyinaa dedaw, mprempren.
Be your father.	Yɛ wo papa.
Not much is known at this time.	Nneɛma pii nnim saa bere yi.
And in that order.	Na wɔ saa nhyehyɛe no mu.
Take one.	Fa biako.
I don’t think it is.	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
It seemed to be the case.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
This was our fault.	Ná eyi yɛ yɛn mfomso.
But this shouldn’t be surprising.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa.
That seems to imply.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno kyerɛ.
It’s up to you this time.	Ɛyɛ wo na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa bere yi.
It’s not my problem.	Ɛnyɛ me haw.
Or their children.	Anaasɛ wɔn mma.
Don’t go to the water’s edge.	Mma nkɔ nsu no ano.
Here is the real story.	Asɛm no ankasa ni.
I can barely hear the music.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nte nnwom no.
People don’t think things through.	Nkurɔfo nsusuw nneɛma ho yiye.
I apologize for him.	Mepa no kyɛw ma no.
Maybe it does.	Ebia ɛyɛ saa.
That had to suck.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno su.
They really work too.	Wɔn nso yɛ adwuma ankasa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ.
I had actually forgotten about that.	Ná me werɛ afi saa asɛm no ankasa.
I trust them completely.	Migye wɔn di koraa.
One man raised both hands.	Ɔbarima biako maa ne nsa abien nyinaa so.
If not, how long did you stick around.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, bere tenten ahe na wode bɔɔ mu.
I’m so proud of you.	M’ani gye wo ho saa.
This is my opinion.	Eyi ne m’adwene.
As you can see, there is an error.	Sɛnea wubetumi ahu no, mfomso bi wɔ hɔ.
I have to go to work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ adwuma.
He is temporarily in charge.	Ɔno na ɔyɛ adwuma no bere tiaa bi.
However, it is not so easy.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
It’s all for the best.	Ne nyinaa yɛ nea eye sen biara.
The emptiness of that room.	Saa dan no mu a ɛda hɔ kwa no.
Some species are now endangered.	Mprempren mmoa ahorow bi wɔ asiane mu.
We can’t make it happen.	Yɛrentumi mma ɛnyɛ yiye.
That was certainly difficult.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛno yɛ den.
Movies were popular at the time.	Saa bere no na nkurɔfo ani gye sini ahorow ho.
Another day, a few hours.	Da foforo, nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi.
If he wants to.	Sɛ ɔpɛ a.
What a great accident.	Akwanhyia kɛse bɛn ara ni.
I'm staying here for two more days.	Mete ha nna abien aka ho.
Let him do what he has to do.	Ma ɔnyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
You say it’s amazing.	Woka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Or whatever you want.	Anaasɛ nea wopɛ.
I look at the time.	Mehwɛ bere no mu.
The dog loves to play.	Ɔkraman ani gye agoru ho.
It had been two years.	Ná ayɛ mfe abien ni.
The kids look at you with curious eyes.	Mmofra no de ani a ɛyɛ anigye hwɛ wo.
Do the same for the back.	Yɛ saa ara ma akyi no.
Something hit his hand.	Biribi bɔɔ ne nsa.
I've had it with those.	Me ne saa nneɛma no anya bi.
There wasn't much else to do.	Ná biribi foforo pii nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
This is how children play.	Eyi ne sɛnea mmofra di agoru.
This has gone too far.	Eyi akɔ akyiri dodo.
Say it through the language.	Ka no fa so kasa.
She was as beautiful as her mother.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ te sɛ ne maame.
Or a car like that.	Anaasɛ kar bi a ɛte saa.
This is a new one.	Eyi yɛ foforo.
I knew exactly what he wanted.	Ná minim nea ɔpɛ no yiye.
It was exciting and exciting.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye na ɛyɛ anigye.
But that didn’t happen.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na esii.
There was no more danger.	Ná asiane biara nni hɔ bio.
You tell him what to do and he does it.	Woka nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ kyerɛ no na ɔyɛ.
The people know this too.	Nkurɔfo no nso nim eyi.
It really does exist.	Ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
However, you don’t have to plan that.	Nanso, ɛho nhia sɛ woyɛ nhyehyɛe saa.
It’s too bad.	Ɛyɛ bɔne dodo.
However, there were other factors.	Nanso, na nneɛma foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
He didn't know where to go.	Ná onnim baabi a ɔbɛkɔ.
In other words, he liked you.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, na n’ani gyee wo ho.
He was not wrong about himself.	Ná ɔnyɛ mfomso wɔ ne ho.
This was becoming increasingly difficult.	Ná eyi reyɛ den kɛse.
Inside as well as outside.	Wɔ mu ne akyi nso.
Be very careful!	Hwɛ yiye paa!
At least I need to work at work for a while.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma wɔ adwumam kakra.
For me, that has everything.	Me fam no, ɛno wɔ biribiara.
The new story was an old story.	Na asɛm foforo no yɛ asɛm dedaw.
You got to go outside.	Wo nyaa kwan kɔ abɔnten.
Look at the car accident.	Hwɛ sɛnea kar akwanhyia no.
This is my favorite movie.	Eyi ne sini a m’ani gye ho paa.
The evening will come to an end.	Anwummere no bɛba awiei.
It’s quite possible.	Ɛyɛ yiye koraa.
She was beautiful that evening.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ saa anwummere no.
I hope you do the same!.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo nso wobɛyɛ saa ara!.
On a certain floor.	Wɔ fam bi so.
That’s what he loved to do.	Ɛno ne nea na n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ.
What you say is important.	Nea woka no yɛ ade a ɛho hia.
I know how this goes.	Minim sɛnea eyi kɔ so.
That much was clear enough.	Ná saa dodow no ara mu da hɔ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
It was an incredibly strange thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He has worked consistently throughout the workday.	Wayɛ adwuma bere nyinaa wɔ adwuma da no nyinaa mu.
There is absolutely nothing you can do about this.	Biribiara nni hɔ koraa a wubetumi ayɛ wɔ eyi ho.
Just don't lie to me.	Nni atoro nkyerɛ me kɛkɛ.
Give it to him.	Fa ma no.
But you have to put them in very deeply.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wode wɔn hyɛ mu kɔ akyiri yiye.
This statement, again, is simplistic and misleading.	Saa asɛm yi, bio, yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ mfomso.
The music will be loud.	Nnwom no bɛbɔ denneennen.
He has the dress and everything.	Ɔwɔ atade no ne biribiara.
I was in the room.	Ná mewɔ dan no mu.
He was definitely a wonderful person.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ nwonwa.
It was as true for him now as it was then.	Ná ɛyɛ nokware ma no mprempren te sɛ nea na ɛte saa bere no.
There is never a story.	Asɛm biara nni hɔ da.
This year is nothing new.	Afe yi nyɛ ade foforo.
So it doesn’t look interesting.	Enti ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
I almost didn’t.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na menyɛ saa.
Besides, it’s such a long drive.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɛyɛ kar tenten a ɛte saa.
This was a wise move.	Ná eyi yɛ ade a nyansa wom.
He doesn't know what's going on.	Onnim nea ɛrekɔ so.
This arrangement is long overdue.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi akyɛ.
Strong hands took him under his arms.	Nsa a ɛyɛ den faa no wɔ ne nsa ase.
How long has he been planning this?	Bere tenten ahe na wayɛ eyi ho nhyehyɛe?
Or at least it used to be.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, kan no na ɛte saa.
I was there for that.	Ná mewɔ hɔ ma ɛno.
I have a lot to say.	Mewɔ nsɛm pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meka.
The first meal should be simple.	Ɛsɛ sɛ aduan a edi kan no yɛ nea ɛnyɛ den.
However, they are not alone.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ wɔn nkutoo na wɔyɛ saa.
Time flies, even when there is work to be done.	Bere tu, bere mpo a adwuma wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no.
Only one foot in the door.	Nan biako pɛ wɔ ɔpon no ano.
We make arrangements for him.	Yɛyɛ nhyehyɛe ma no.
You can get what you want there.	Wubetumi anya nea wopɛ wɔ hɔ.
The movie is fascinating.	Sini no yɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
Maybe that’s a good thing.	Ebia ɛno yɛ ade pa.
I don’t want this to end.	Mempɛ sɛ eyi bɛba awiei.
But there was nothing anyone could do.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ a obiara betumi ayɛ.
He was like.	Ná ɔte sɛ.
Go and check it out.	Kɔ hwɛ.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
And he felt sorry for me	Na ɔyɛɛ no ​​yaw maa me .
Only you can do this for me.	Wo nkutoo na wubetumi ayɛ eyi ama me.
His mind is quite simple.	N’adwene yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
But don’t tell me.	Nanso nka nkyerɛ me.
Eliminate any other thoughts.	Yi adwene foforo biara fi hɔ.
More on that later.	Ɛno ho nsɛm pii akyiri yi.
After that, the story kind of went downhill.	Ɛno akyi no, asɛm no kɔɔ fam wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
But no more work this day.	Nanso adwuma biara nni hɔ bio da yi.
I thought he might have been a police officer.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia na ɔyɛ polisifo adwuma.
At least what’s left of them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, nea aka wɔ wɔn ho.
He slipped into her.	Ɔde ne ho too ne so.
His only two.	Ne baanu koro pɛ.
Know less, think more.	Hu kakraa bi, susuw pii ho.
The same may be true for you.	Saa ara na ebia wo nso wubetumi ayɛ saa.
It’s been such a long time.	Ɛyɛ bere tenten saa.
He spends the rest of his life there.	Ɔde ne nkwa nna a aka nyinaa tra hɔ.
You can find them here.	Wubetumi ahu wɔn wɔ ha.
The most important thing is for everyone to have fun.	Nea ɛho hia sen biara ne sɛ obiara begye n’ani.
They were friends.	Ná wɔyɛ nnamfo.
This may be the case.	Ebia eyi te saa.
The big issue here is the risk to you.	Asɛm kɛse a ɛwɔ ha ne asiane a ɛwɔ hɔ ma wo.
And often it did.	Na mpɛn pii no na ɛyɛ saa.
We need to work now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma mprempren.
Not such a bad idea.	Ɛnyɛ adwene bɔne saa.
I don’t want to go there.	Mempɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ.
You don’t have to tell anyone.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woka kyerɛ obiara.
I heard it was very nice.	Metee sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Both of you guys.	Mo baanu nyinaa.
The dress fell to the ground.	Atade no hwee fam.
But you know what it’s like.	Nanso wunim sɛnea ɛte.
I still have a lot of work to do.	Meda so ara wɔ adwuma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
I can’t really figure out how to do that though.	Me ntumi nhu sɛnea mɛyɛ saa ankasa de, nanso.
And so the problem comes down to this.	Na enti ɔhaw no ba fam wɔ eyi mu.
This is my new car.	Eyi ne me kar foforo.
It actually has a way.	Ɛwɔ ɔkwan bi ankasa.
Review the information, he told himself.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ, san hwɛ nsɛm no mu.
And that was the last one.	Na ɛno ne nea etwa to.
We all had to deal with it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa di ho dwuma.
He was a good guy.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ papa.
There is a lot of truth in it.	Nokware pii wɔ so.
Planning is difficult.	Nhyehyɛe yɛ den.
The bitter cold bothered me.	Awɔw a ano yɛ den no haw me.
We enjoy a wide variety of music.	Yɛn ani gye nnwom ahorow pii ho.
He spent the rest of his life there.	Ɔde ne nkwa nna a aka nyinaa traa hɔ.
However, it hasn’t always been a perfect situation.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ayɛ tebea a edi mũ.
He did so in a terrible way.	Ɔyɛɛ saa wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu so.
However, there is more.	Nanso, pii wɔ hɔ.
The danger is great.	Asiane no yɛ kɛse.
He wanted to give her everything.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde biribiara ma no.
The filling of the object.	Ade a wɔde hyɛ mu ma.
By then it was already too late.	Saa bere no na aka akyi dodo dedaw.
Your father was a good man.	Ná wo papa yɛ ɔbarima pa.
I think he likes the idea.	Misusuw sɛ n’ani gye adwene no ho.
I'm so excited and I hope you can check it out.	M'ani agye yiye na mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi ahwɛ.
He knew their character.	Ná onim wɔn su.
Or so everyone said.	Anaasɛ saa na obiara kae.
I still slept just fine.	Ná meda so ara da yiye ara kwa.
Not bad so far.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne de besi nnɛ.
This has nothing to do with appearance.	Eyi mfa sɛnea obi te ho.
There was nothing he could do now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na obetumi ayɛ mprempren.
People said it was too expensive or too expensive.	Nkurɔfo kae sɛ ne bo yɛ den dodo anaasɛ ɛyɛ den dodo.
This is not a terrible thing.	Eyi nyɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu.
If anyone could give me a hand I would appreciate it.	Sɛ obi betumi ama me nsa a anka m’ani begye ho.
He glanced at everything.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ biribiara so.
Can you give me some money?	So wubetumi ama me sika bi?
The children are careful.	Mmofra no hwɛ yiye.
Do it anyway.	Yɛ no ɔkwan biara so.
There are no real jobs.	Nnwuma ankasa biara nni hɔ.
He's stronger than he's ever been.	Ɔyɛ den sen sɛnea na wayɛ pɛn.
You are much more beautiful than that.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ sen saa koraa.
I lean my head against his.	Mede me ti to ne de no so.
In any case, it was too late.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na aka akyi dodo.
I feel his pain.	Mete ne yaw no nka.
This means now.	Eyi kyerɛ mprempren.
And say so.	Na ka saa.
It hasn’t been for years.	Mfe pii ni a ɛnyɛ saa.
This is not my house.	Eyi nyɛ me fie.
He knew too well now what that felt like.	Ná onim yiye dodo mprempren sɛnea ɛno te nka.
It was a little more stylish.	Ná ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ kakra.
Consider your plans.	Susuw nhyehyɛe a woayɛ no ho.
That’s what you do best.	Ɛno ne nea woyɛ no yiye.
They are late for work.	Wɔka akyi wɔ adwuma mu.
I hope you enjoy this tutorial.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ adesua yi bɛma w’ani agye.
This is not the point now.	Ɛnyɛ eyi ne asɛm no mprempren.
It wasn’t something that needed to be done.	Ná ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
But it all comes down to this season.	Nanso ne nyinaa ba fam kosi saa bere yi mu.
Maybe it does in their current mindset.	Ebia ɛyɛ saa wɔ wɔn mprempren adwene no mu.
This was certainly true for me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na eyi yɛ nokware ma me.
And this is nothing either.	Na eyi nso nyɛ hwee.
The whole city ended at the same time.	Kurow no nyinaa baa awiei bere koro no ara mu.
However, that is not necessarily the case.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea ɛte saa ankasa.
I hope you are not doing anything important.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wonyɛ biribi a ɛho hia.
I completely understand your fear.	Mete wo suro no ase koraa.
Within a few hours.	Wɔ nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi mu.
Tomorrow has every chance of being a good day.	Ɔkyena wɔ hokwan biara sɛ ɛbɛyɛ da pa.
There is none of that.	Ɛno mu biara nni hɔ.
There is a lot of variety in this popular dish.	Nneɛma ahorow pii wɔ saa aduan a agye din yi mu.
Some hot food too.	Aduan a ɛyɛ hyew bi nso.
We were alone at the time.	Yɛn nkutoo saa bere no.
Something bad had happened.	Ná biribi bɔne bi asi.
I couldn’t, not in the way he could.	Na mintumi, ɛnyɛ ɔkwan a na obetumi ayɛ no so.
Maybe he's involved.	Ebia ɔde ne ho ahyɛ mu.
I could never do it again.	Na mintumi nyɛ bio da.
He is a bad guy.	Ɔyɛ onipa bɔne.
He spent many of his early years in prison.	Ɔde ne mfe a edi kan no pii traa afiase.
It didn’t work.	Anyɛ adwuma.
He now lives in a cell.	Mprempren ɔte afiase dan bi mu.
Do what is necessary.	Yɛ nea ɛho hia.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
This must have succeeded.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi adi nkonim.
This idea is not good at all.	Saa adwene yi nyɛ papa koraa.
You can see the city from here.	Wubetumi afi ha ahu kurow no.
This man was strong.	Ná onipa yi ho yɛ den.
Driving into the city was very difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den yiye sɛ wɔde kar bɛkɔ kurow no mu.
Everyone else was shocked.	Obiara a aka no ho dwiriw no.
I think that’s just part of the story.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm no fã bi kɛkɛ.
I want my kids to be the best at what they do.	Mepɛ sɛ me mma no yɛ nea eye sen biara wɔ nea wɔyɛ mu.
He’ll be interested.	N’ani begye ho.
He immediately felt a little better.	Ntɛm ara na ne ho tɔɔ no kakra.
He had to exercise self-control.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ odi ne ho so.
There are a lot of phones in town now.	Telefon ahorow pii wɔ kurow no mu mprempren.
Many have come for years.	Pii de mfe pii aba.
The urge was stronger than he was.	Ná ɔpɛ no mu yɛ den sen no.
So that’s always there.	Enti ɛno wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
We love that song.	Yɛn ani gye saa dwom no ho.
Apart from these details, there was nothing else.	Sɛ saa nsɛm yi da nkyɛn a, na biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
He loved his money.	Ná n’ani gye ne sika ho.
It was cold.	Ná awɔw wom.
Any of you?	Mo mu biara?
Their antics almost convinced me.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔn agoru a wɔde di agoru no maa migye dii.
Return as soon as possible.	San kɔ ntɛm ara sɛnea wubetumi.
Every year, we introduce new information.	Afe biara, yɛde nsɛm foforo ba.
No one is in class.	Obiara nni adesua mu.
It did feel warm.	Ná ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ hyew ampa.
I am new to this.	Meyɛ foforo wɔ eyi mu.
This problem does not occur after tests.	Saa ɔhaw yi mma wɔ sɔhwɛ ahorow akyi.
But it never happened again.	Nanso amma bio da.
But not over and over again.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii ne mpɛn pii.
I tell the beautiful stories.	Meka nsɛm a ɛyɛ fɛ no kyerɛ.
He could take money home.	Ná obetumi de sika akɔ fie.
Or maybe you just don’t know what to do next.	Anaasɛ ebia wunnim nea wobɛyɛ akyi ara kwa.
If someone gives him food, he eats.	Sɛ obi ma no aduan a, odi.
But first things first.	Nanso nneɛma a edi kan a edi kan.
None of us knew what was going on.	Ná yɛn mu biara nnim nea ɛrekɔ so.
We will be very interested.	Yɛn ani begye ho kɛse.
I told you this afternoon.	Meka kyerɛɛ wo awia yi.
You are the one who tells us.	Wo na woka kyerɛ yɛn.
Go play that.	Kɔ bɔ saa.
We would appreciate your feedback.	Yɛn ani begye wo nsɛm a wobɛka ho.
Often, it wasn’t.	Mpɛn pii no, na ɛnte saa.
I couldn’t imagine it.	Na mintumi nsusuw ho.
It is perfect as it is now.	Ɛyɛ pɛ sɛnea ɛte mprempren no.
At home that’s easy.	Wɔ fie no ɛno yɛ mmerɛw.
I think it will be fine.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
Keep doing this.	Kɔ so yɛ eyi.
Maybe this is it.	Ebia na eyi ne no.
Her father said she was too excited, but that wasn’t the truth.	Ne papa kae sɛ n’ani agye dodo, nanso ɛnyɛ nokware no.
He is better than me.	Ɔyɛ papa sen me.
This is my home now.	Eyi ne me fie mprempren.
So you get to know these people incredibly quickly.	Enti wuhu saa nnipa yi ntɛmntɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
You can spend some time painting there if you want.	Wubetumi de bere kakra ayɛ mfonini wɔ hɔ sɛ wopɛ a.
I am a mother now.	Meyɛ maame mprempren.
But your appearance is not the real problem.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛnea wo ho yɛ fɛ no ne ɔhaw ankasa.
Why is there so much.	Dɛn nti na ɛdɔɔso saa.
There is a lot of information here.	Nsɛm pii wɔ ha.
None of them work.	Wɔn mu biara nyɛ adwuma.
The strongest managed to survive.	Wɔn a wɔn ho yɛ den sen biara no tumi nyaa nkwa.
He had done a lot.	Ná wayɛ pii.
The same is true of us.	Saa ara na yɛn nso yɛbɛyɛ.
That book sounds interesting.	Saa nhoma no te sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
He was a human being.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa.
If it’s not one thing, it’s another.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ade biako a, ɛyɛ ade foforo.
There was only one way.	Ná ɔkwan biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I don’t know how he’s going to do it.	Minnim sɛnea ɔbɛyɛ.
He is incredibly popular.	Ɔyɛ obi a nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
It’s much worse than that.	Ɛyɛ bɔne sen saa koraa.
Which is not bad, but not good either.	Nea ɛnyɛ bɔne, nanso ɛnyɛ papa nso.
Indeed.	Ampa ara.
During this time, you will work every day.	Saa bere yi mu no, wobɛyɛ adwuma da biara.
But in !!!.	Nanso wɔ !!!.
It was wonderful, all of it.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa, ne nyinaa.
And you should see him here.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no wɔ ha.
Many languages ​​are now spoken.	Mprempren wɔka kasa ahorow pii.
You know more than they do.	Wunim pii sen wɔn.
I was really terrible.	Ná me ho yɛ hu ankasa.
Maybe he would do the same.	Ebia na ɔbɛyɛ saa ara.
Maybe he had one.	Ebia na ɔwɔ bi.
Nothing would be the same anymore.	Anka biribiara nni hɔ a ɛbɛyɛ pɛ bio.
Only money does that.	Sika nkutoo na ɛyɛ saa.
A police case.	Polisifo asɛm bi.
That’s another thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade foforo.
We need to be united.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ biako.
The mind really.	Adwene ampa.
I believe you can do it.	Migye di sɛ wubetumi ayɛ.
Not this time around.	Ɛnyɛ saa bere yi de.
He put it so well.	Ɔde sii hɔ yiye saa.
Things could get worse, as he might say.	Nneɛma betumi ayɛ kɛse, sɛnea ebia ɔbɛka no.
His mother did not want him to play.	Ná ne maame mpɛ sɛ ɔbɔ agoru no.
That is absolutely true.	Ɛno yɛ nokware koraa.
Close the door.	To ɔpon no mu.
But only the general order.	Nanso nhyehyɛe a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa nkutoo.
It was difficult for me.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma me.
It’s beautiful here.	Ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ ha.
He would do all the work.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ adwuma no nyinaa.
But the problem remains.	Nanso ɔhaw no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
That in itself started to feel strange.	Ɛno ankasa fii ase yɛɛ nwonwa.
I am really looking forward to this.	Mehwɛ eyi kwan ankasa.
It becomes a simplistic view of things.	Ɛbɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ mmerɛw wɔ nneɛma ho.
He quickly left the city.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm fii kurow no mu.
That has come here.	Ɛno aba ha.
In any case.	Wɔ tebea biara mu.
Nobody knows.	Obiara nnim.
So, what was it like?	Enti, na ɛte dɛn?
The two are just one thing, absolutely.	Nneɛma abien no yɛ ade biako ara kwa, koraa.
This went on for half a day.	Eyi kɔɔ so da fã.
His mother took my house and my children.	Ne maame faa me fie ne me mma.
I wonder which of us it is.	Misusuw sɛ yɛn mu hena na ɛyɛ.
He never does that.	Ɔnyɛ saa da.
Our new system is similar.	Yɛn nhyehyɛe foforo no te saa ara.
Save someone’s life.	Gye obi nkwa.
They seem to work and look great.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ adwuma na wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
People often say that people make up stories.	Nkurɔfo taa ka sɛ nkurɔfo na wɔyɛ nsɛm.
I couldn’t think of anything but him.	Na mintumi nsusuw biribiara ho gye ɔno.
It was fast and it should be fast.	Na ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
That's probably quite fast enough.	Ebia ɛno yɛ ntɛmntɛm koraa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
But apparently you’re also a nice person.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ wo nso woyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It’s just the truth.	Ɛyɛ nokware no ara kwa.
I hope yours does too!.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo de nso yɛ saa!.
I don’t know anything about it.	Minnim ho hwee.
For me, this was always a problem.	Wɔ me fam no, na eyi yɛ ɔhaw bere nyinaa.
I really really like it.	M’ani gye ho ankasa ankasa.
This is a given.	Eyi yɛ ade a wɔde ama.
Or better yet.	Anaasɛ nea eye sen saa.
I want someone to handle it.	Mepɛ sɛ obi di ho dwuma.
That was the job.	Ná ɛno ne adwuma no.
That is if you use windows.	Ɛno ne sɛ wode mfɛnsere di dwuma a.
But he didn't know why.	Nanso na onnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
And yet again.	Na nanso bio.
I am, too, a human being.	Me nso, onipa.
He is the one who is presented.	Ɔno na wɔde akyerɛ.
That table looks very old.	Saa pon no te sɛ nea akyɛ yiye.
It just seemed to happen.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
I expect a good year for him.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ afe pa bɛba ama no.
That would have been better.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
Their meeting was already late.	Ná wɔn nhyiam no aka akyi dedaw.
You go with him.	Wo ne no kɔ.
This is not cheap.	Eyi nyɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den.
Everything there seems old and new at the same time.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ dedaw ne foforo bere koro mu.
You can do it now.	Wubetumi ayɛ no mprempren.
At least for the first few moments.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, bere tiaa bi a edi kan no.
That is true now.	Ɛno yɛ nokware mprempren.
I will definitely be doing more of that really soon.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mɛyɛ saa pii no nnansa yi ara ankasa.
I know you want to make a point.	Minim sɛ wopɛ sɛ woka asɛm bi ho asɛm.
Not this child.	Ɛnyɛ abofra yi.
He cheered his dog on the cheek.	Ɔde anigye bɔɔ ne kraman no anim.
Neither you nor anyone else is from here.	Wo anaa obi foforo biara mfi ha.
You may tell them as much or as little as you like.	Ebia wobɛka pii anaa kakraa bi akyerɛ wɔn sɛnea wopɛ.
His hands were tight on her arms.	Ná ne nsa ayɛ den wɔ ne nsa so.
I don’t want you.	Mempɛ wo.
I could draw, paint, whatever.	Ná metumi ayɛ mfonini, ayɛ mfonini, nea ɛte biara.
Hopefully it will work out.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
However, there is nothing wrong with it.	Nanso, mfomso biara nni ho.
You are one.	Woyɛ biako.
None of this was the case.	Eyi mu biara nni hɔ a na ɛte saa.
Most likely the truth has just passed.	Ɛda adi kɛse sɛ nokware no atwam ara kwa.
It has a happy ending.	Ɛwɔ awiei a ɛyɛ anigye.
It was too soon for this.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo ma eyi.
Good morning, everyone.	Anɔpa pa, obiara.
I have to say the thing looks great on a gun.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ ade no hwɛ yiye wɔ tuo so.
Mom's story is true.	Maame asɛm no yɛ nokware.
In my opinion, it’s the best of our humanity, really.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no, ɛyɛ yɛn nnipa su a eye sen biara, ampa.
He wasn't, and so he didn't know what to say.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa, na enti na onnim nea ɔbɛka.
But this is the end.	Nanso eyi ne awiei no.
I had no plans.	Ná minni nhyehyɛe biara.
We can start again.	Yebetumi afi ase bio.
We almost get hit by a car.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ kar bi bɛbɔ yɛn.
He could help us a lot.	Ná obetumi aboa yɛn kɛse.
Almost, but okay.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ, nanso ɛnyɛ hwee.
In a way it’s like sex.	Ɔkwan bi so no ɛte sɛ nna.
How tall are you?	Wo tenten ahe?
Most of the time.	Mpɛn dodow no ara.
And he could do that.	Na obetumi ayɛ saa.
Thank those people who give it to them.	Da saa nnipa a wɔde ma wɔn no ase.
It’s too hard.	Ɛyɛ den dodo.
Everyone knows now.	Obiara nim mprempren.
It was all set up.	Wɔde ne nyinaa sii hɔ.
It’s really, really great.	Ɛyɛ kɛse ankasa, ankasa.
A long time ago now.	Bere tenten a atwam ni mprempren.
Production is also a problem.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ no nso yɛ ɔhaw.
But no one really wants that.	Nanso obiara mpɛ saa ankasa.
The police were shocked.	Polisifo no ho dwiriw wɔn.
I love that you love the outdoors.	M’ani gye ho sɛ w’ani gye abɔnten so ho.
To make it bigger.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
But that may be going a little too far.	Nanso ebia ɛno rekɔ akyiri dodo kakra.
If money is needed, give it.	Sɛ sika ho hia a, fa ma.
It is very popular and inexpensive.	Ɛyɛ ade a agye din yiye na ne bo nyɛ den.
Those songs were amazing.	Ná saa nnwom no yɛ nwonwa.
I think that’s a bit interesting.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ anigye kakra.
He pointed to the book.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ nhoma no mu.
I don’t want you to do anything for me.	Mempɛ sɛ woyɛ biribiara mma me.
It was never about me.	Na ɛnyɛ me ho asɛm da.
I heard them.	Metee wɔn.
We used it too.	Yɛde dii dwuma nso.
Most participants thought so.	Wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ mu no mu dodow no ara susuwii sɛ ɛte saa.
But back to work.	Nanso san kɔ adwuma so.
There is no power at all.	Tumi biara nni hɔ hwee.
Finally, the door closed.	Awiei koraa no, ɔpon no too mu.
It’s easy to do.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobɛyɛ.
We are our best selves and our worst selves.	Yɛyɛ yɛn ho a eye sen biara na yɛyɛ yɛn ho bɔne sen biara.
I also love the dog.	M’ani gye ɔkraman no nso ho.
No testing, nothing.	Sɔhwɛ biara nni hɔ, biribiara nni hɔ.
Don’t drive too fast.	Mfa kar nkɔ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
You will do it again.	Wobɛyɛ bio.
I have to be honest with your mother.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka nokware kyerɛ wo maame.
I am in no mood .	Me nni adwene biara mu .
They were good people.	Ná wɔyɛ nnipa pa.
The same was true of me.	Saa ara na na ɛte wɔ me fam.
I was good at it.	Ná me ho akokwaw wɔ mu.
His hands were strong and weak.	Ná ne nsa yɛ den na na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
However, many people agree with the whole story.	Nanso, nnipa pii gye asɛm a wɔka no nyinaa tom.
I could use some days.	Metumi de nna bi adi dwuma.
I couldn’t do anything right this time.	Na mintumi nyɛ biribiara yiye saa bere yi.
And happiness, too.	Na anigye nso.
Part of me still thinks so.	Me fã bi da so ara susuw saa.
However, he could come sooner.	Nanso, na obetumi aba ntɛm.
I had this one.	Ná mewɔ eyi.
I believe these people knew each other.	Migye di sɛ na saa nkurɔfo yi nim wɔn ho wɔn ho.
So, this is both.	Enti, eyi ne abien no nyinaa.
It’s a fascinating story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
It is now one game to win it.	Mprempren ɛyɛ agoru biako a wode bedi nkonim wɔ mu.
I don’t know if they were terrible.	Minnim sɛ ebia na wɔyɛ hu anaa.
It was such a wonderful idea.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa saa.
Big mistake, what has he really done for the people.	Mfomso kɛse, dɛn na wayɛ ama nkurɔfo no ankasa.
Everything is at your end of the table.	Biribiara wɔ wo pon no awiei.
There were several reasons for this.	Ná nneɛma pii nti na ɛte saa.
I didn’t agree with him.	Me ne no anyɛ adwene.
This was for me being good.	Ná eyi yɛ ma me a meyɛ papa.
He has done it before.	Wayɛ no pɛn.
I was definitely a happy kid.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na meyɛ abofra a ɔwɔ anigye.
It was good, even.	Ná eye, mpo.
Pa glanced at it.	Pa de n’ani kyerɛɛ so.
None of them are that bad.	Wɔn mu biara nyɛ bɔne saa.
He is my son.	Ɔyɛ me ba.
He wants so much to touch her.	Ɔpɛ pii sɛ ɔde ne nsa bɛka no.
But there was no age in that.	Nanso na mfe a obi adi nni saa mu.
I had my eyes on it.	Ná m’ani wɔ mu.
A busy night.	Anadwo a adagyew nnim.
Don’t eat bad food.	Nni aduan bɔne.
It’s all or nothing.	Ɛyɛ ne nyinaa anaasɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
The cast is fantastic in this film.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ sini no yɛ nwonwa wɔ sini yi mu.
Don’t step away from it.	Mfa wo nan mfi ho.
Play with her children.	Wo ne ne mma nni agoru.
This year, he has to.	Afe yi, ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Who travels alone?	Hena na ɔno nkutoo tu kwan?
It has many chapters.	Ɛwɔ ti ahorow pii.
Assume that it isn’t.	Fa no sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
Or you can tell us what you know.	Anaasɛ wubetumi aka nea wunim akyerɛ yɛn.
So it’s been a lot of fun.	Enti ayɛ anigye kɛse.
Water resources are scarce.	Nsu ho nneɛma ho yɛ na.
He just sits there.	Ɔte hɔ ara kwa.
But a little bit of both.	Nanso abien no nyinaa kakra.
This was my favorite.	Ná eyi ne nea m’ani gye ho paa.
He seemed familiar.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onim no yiye.
Your name.	Wo din.
My mind was too busy.	Ná m’adwene yɛ adwuma dodo.
The food isn’t good, but it’s sufficient.	Aduan no nyɛ papa, nanso ɛdɔɔso.
It never works.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma da.
After a while, my mother nodded.	Bere bi akyi no, me maame de ne ti too fam.
So create one.	Enti bɔ biako.
It’s not really true.	Ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa.
He was a little stiff.	Ná ɔyɛ den kakra.
I am, as they say, outside in the cold.	Mewɔ, sɛnea wɔka no, abɔnten wɔ awɔw mu.
This was the bed.	Ná eyi ne mpa no.
I want it all.	Mepɛ ne nyinaa.
And maybe there is.	Na ebia ɛwɔ hɔ.
I am sure you would do the same.	Migye di sɛ anka wobɛyɛ saa ara.
That much was pretty clear.	Ná saa dodow no ara mu da hɔ yiye.
The information available.	Nsɛm a ɛwɔ hɔ.
I believe that it is.	Migye di sɛ ɛte saa.
You can’t imagine it.	Worentumi nsusuw ho.
It’s not a big deal.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse.
Remember, you are human.	Kae sɛ woyɛ onipa.
That doesn’t make me bad or anything.	Ɛno mma menyɛ bɔne anaa biribiara.
The food is not good.	Aduan no nyɛ papa.
Tell him but it's fine.	Ka kyerɛɛ no ​​nanso eye.
Nor is what you seem to see.	Saa ara nso na nea ɛte sɛ nea wuhu no nyɛ saa.
It was mine.	Ná ɛyɛ me de.
I am his son.	Meyɛ ne ba.
He is not very bright.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hyew kɛse.
The infrastructure is important.	Nneɛma a wɔde yɛ adwuma no ho hia.
And it doesn’t matter anyway.	Na ɛnyɛ hwee ɔkwan biara so.
It’s like everything else.	Ɛte sɛ biribiara.
He has done so.	Wayɛ saa.
Anyone who is interested.	Obiara a n’ani gye ho.
It was the last day of classes for this group.	Ná ɛyɛ adesua da a etwa to ma kuw yi.
Finally, your wife comes.	Awiei koraa no, wo yere ba.
He wasn’t interested at all.	Ná n’ani nnye ho koraa.
And it’s for a great reason.	Na ɛyɛ ade kɛse bi nti.
They are not included.	Wɔn nka ho.
This has not worked.	Eyi nyɛɛ adwuma.
The tests were not good.	Ná sɔhwɛ ahorow no nyɛ papa.
You don’t know that for sure.	Wunnim saa asɛm no yiye.
The test is over.	Sɔhwɛ no aba awiei.
Many people have cars these days.	Nnipa pii wɔ kar nnansa yi.
Not much help.	Ɛnyɛ mmoa kɛse.
Over the same weekend.	Wɔ dapɛn awiei koro no ara mu.
I have little of everything.	Biribiara kakraa bi na mewɔ.
Or so he tells himself.	Anaasɛ saa na ɔka kyerɛ ne ho.
He tried, too.	Ɔno nso bɔɔ mmɔden.
This in itself doesn’t mean much.	Eyi ankasa nkyerɛ pii.
There are a lot of awesome people out there.	Nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ hu pii wɔ hɔ.
But these things don’t happen overnight.	Nanso saa nneɛma yi nkɔ so da koro pɛ.
Keep the background simple.	Ma akyi nsɛm no nyɛ mmerɛw.
It had been amazing.	Ná ayɛ nwonwa.
You either do or you don’t.	Woyɛ anaasɛ wonyɛ.
He always wanted to give it his all.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde ne nyinaa ma no bere nyinaa.
He just wanted to play with her.	Ná nea ɔpɛ ara ne sɛ ɔne no bedi agoru.
This is definitely a plan for a very very long time!.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ nhyehyɛe ma bere tenten paa paa!.
Apparently he did.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
He had amazing hair.	Ná ɔwɔ ti nhwi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He was taken inside.	Wɔde no kɔɔ mu.
It has been really hard for them.	Ayɛ den ama wɔn ankasa.
Let that.	Ma sɛ.
In a way, it was good tonight.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na eye anadwo yi.
They usually all eat around the same time.	Mpɛn pii no, ne nyinaa di bɛyɛ bere koro mu.
Be careful with what you say.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ nsɛm a woka no ho.
He knew what was there.	Ná onim nea ɛwɔ hɔ.
He moved his hands over his eyes.	Ɔde ne nsa faa n’ani so.
He shouldn’t be alone.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔno nkutoo tra hɔ.
It was all built on opportunities.	Wɔde ne nyinaa sii hokwan ahorow so.
That stuff is a big part of it.	Saa ade no yɛ ne fã kɛse.
Anyone can be great.	Obiara betumi ayɛ kɛse.
Is it me, right? 	Ɛyɛ me anaa?
This is a whole new story.	Eyi yɛ asɛm foforo koraa.
However, I couldn’t do that.	Nanso, na mintumi nyɛ saa.
Now there are problems with the course itself.	Seesei ɔhaw ahorow wɔ adesua no ankasa ho.
He is not a human being.	Ɔnyɛ onipa.
This would be the snake he would use his hands on.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ ɔwɔ a na ɔde ne nsa bedi dwuma no.
There was plenty of partying and drinking.	Ná apontow ne nsa pii wɔ hɔ.
The latter was our favorite.	Nea etwa to no na yɛn ani gyee ho.
This is a difficult subject to discuss.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka ho asɛm.
It all seems like a long time ago.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne nyinaa yɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
The main entrance was out of the question.	Ná ɔpon kɛse no nni asɛm no mu.
There is no time now.	Bere biara nni hɔ mprempren.
Not for most of us.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn mu dodow no ara de.
It’s completely casual.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛnyɛ hwee koraa.
That was something he enjoyed.	Ɛno yɛ biribi a ɔde nyaa anigye.
Just look at this picture.	Hwɛ mfonini yi kɛkɛ.
And there has never been a time like the present.	Na bere biara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ mprempren de no.
Get closer to me.	Bɛn me.
And it was just sitting there.	Na na ɛte hɔ ara kwa.
For us it’s a very important issue.	Yɛn deɛ ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛho hia paa.
It’s not just his eyes.	Ɛnyɛ n’ani nkutoo.
What would you have done.	Dɛn na anka wobɛyɛ.
He has to be what he is now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nea ɔyɛ mprempren.
People really enjoy the convention.	Nkurɔfo ani gye nhyiam no ho ankasa.
It just gets harder.	Ɛyɛ den kɛse ara kwa.
Simple statements.	Nsɛm a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
A large squirrel.	Ɔkraman kɛse bi.
He was with me all the way down.	Ná ɔne me wɔ hɔ kosi fam nyinaa.
But it’s not true, it’s not true anymore.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nokware, ɛnyɛ nokware bio.
It feels good to say it out loud anyway.	Ɛte nka sɛ eye sɛ wobɛka no den ɔkwan biara so.
The other children stay alive.	Mmofra a aka no nso tra ase.
For the same reason.	Ade biako no ara nti.
Thank you for your help.	Meda mo ase wɔ mo mmoa no ho.
But the real problem is very complicated.	Nanso ɔhaw ankasa no yɛ den yiye.
A few more days and we might be able to travel again.	Nna kakraa bi bio na ebia yebetumi atu kwan bio.
These two things are not the same.	Saa nneɛma abien yi nyɛ ade koro.
It didn’t walk out like that.	Ɛnyɛ nantew fii adi saa.
But why the below did not work.	Nanso nea enti a nea ɛwɔ ase ha yi anyɛ adwuma.
That was nothing to him.	Ná ɛno nyɛ hwee wɔ ne fam.
If only he could see.	Sɛ na obetumi ahu nkutoo a.
I have been incredibly busy as of late.	Mewɔ adagyew a ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛnea ɛte nnansa yi.
No one wanted to do that.	Ná obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
That was the game.	Ná ɛno ne agoru no.
I had done them many times before.	Ná mayɛ wɔn mpɛn pii pɛn.
People respond to it.	Nkurɔfo yɛ ho biribi.
That’s more like that.	Ɛno te sɛ ɛno kɛse.
I had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
Everyone needs help.	Obiara hia mmoa.
He knew what he was doing.	Ná onim nea ɔreyɛ.
That seemed impossible.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
It’s a significant number.	Ɛyɛ dodow a ɛho hia.
I still can’t believe he took that to bed.	Meda so ara ntumi nnye nni sɛ ɔde saa asɛm no kɔɔ mpa so.
I'm a nice person, and I'm a very strong person.	Meyɛ obi a me ho yɛ fɛ, na meyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ den yiye.
He knew one of them.	Ná onim wɔn mu biako.
Say their names again.	Ka wɔn din bio.
What is the importance of books?	Nhoma ho hia bɛn?
There is no plan.	Nhyehyɛe biara nni hɔ.
There were no negatives.	Ná nneɛma bɔne biara nni hɔ.
It might be a little longer, but that doesn’t matter.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ tenten kakra, nanso ɛno mfa ho.
But no one knew him.	Nanso na obiara nnim no.
You can do so much.	Wubetumi ayɛ nneɛma pii saa.
But don’t tell me.	Nanso nka nkyerɛ me.
I told him that at the time.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​saa saa bere no.
And we can show that it is perfect in this case.	Na yebetumi akyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ pɛ wɔ asɛm yi mu.
It is truly a wonderful story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa ampa.
It’s just an empty thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a hwee nni mu ara kwa.
I believe it wasn’t.	Migye di sɛ na ɛnte saa.
I hope you enjoyed the last chapter.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani gyee ti a etwa to no ho.
I'm a beautiful guy.	Me ho yɛ fɛ.
This paper is just one way.	Krataa yi yɛ ɔkwan biako pɛ.
These pictures are difficult.	Saa mfonini ahorow yi yɛ den.
He had many friends.	Ná ɔwɔ nnamfo pii.
I am the subject of the matter.	Meyɛ asɛm no ho asɛm.
Same thing every day.	Ade koro no ara da biara da.
They make good music.	Wɔyɛ nnwom pa.
He participated in the experiment.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ sɔhwɛ no mu.
It exists empty for a while.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a hwee nni mu bere tiaa bi.
There is no number of people.	Nnipa dodow biara nni hɔ.
He liked almost everything.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na n’ani gye biribiara ho.
The reasons for this are many.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no yɛ pii.
Much later than in previous years.	Akyiri yi koraa sen mfe a atwam no.
But it wasn’t this.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ eyi.
He looked at her with interest.	Ɔde anigye hwɛɛ no.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho ankasa.
You’ll love it, no problem.	W’ani begye ho, ɔhaw biara nni ho.
I have friends.	Mewɔ nnamfo.
He’s with someone else.	Ɔne obi foforo.
I think everyone should too!.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ obiara nso!.
That’s why it was such a good plan.	Ɛno nti na na ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe pa saa no.
We can’t be late.	Yɛrentumi nka akyi.
No one said anything positive.	Obiara anka biribi pa biara.
You don’t need to know.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wuhu.
You are a great person.	Woyɛ onipa kɛse.
He had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Hopefully that will happen soon.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ saa asɛm no bɛba nnansa yi ara.
Most of them were outdated.	Ná wɔn mu dodow no ara ne bere atwam.
But there is more at stake.	Nanso pii wɔ hɔ a ɛwɔ asɛm no mu.
Thank you !.	Meda wo ase !.
It’s a beautiful idea.	Ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ fɛ.
The story is true.	Asɛm no yɛ nokware.
The process is not that difficult.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ no nyɛ den saa.
It was not difficult at all.	Ná ɛnyɛ den koraa.
You can do it again.	Wubetumi ayɛ bio.
But it was really nice to be there.	Nanso na ɛyɛ anigye ankasa sɛ mewɔ hɔ.
This is just one of them.	Eyi yɛ biako pɛ.
We have a lot of kids like him here.	Yɛwɔ mmofra pii te sɛ ɔno wɔ ha.
We are free of ourselves.	Yɛde yɛn ho.
Or much much more.	Anaasɛ pii pii sen saa.
This is true, to some extent.	Eyi yɛ nokware, kosi baabi.
He had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Or at least it was, for about a week.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte saa, bɛyɛ dapɛn biako.
That didn’t work either.	Ɛno nso anyɛ adwuma.
There just seemed to be so much fun this year.	Na ɛte sɛ nea anigye pii wɔ hɔ ara kwa afe yi.
Just look below.	Hwɛ ase hɔ ara kwa.
That’s all that’s left of their father.	Ɛno ne nea aka wɔ wɔn papa so.
I don’t like it anymore here.	M’ani nnye ho bio wɔ ha.
It seems to be easy.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
There was so much to do.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Stay in the room.	Tra dan no mu.
See there, too.	Hwɛ hɔ nso.
He does the same thing.	Ɔno nso yɛ saa.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani gye ho paa.
So it had to be beautiful and important.	Enti na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛho hia.
This is my room.	Eyi ne me dan.
He had gone with the others.	Ná ɔne wɔn a aka no akɔ.
Eventually, the boy quickly mastered the language.	Awiei koraa no, abarimaa no huu kasa no yiye ntɛmntɛm.
Take care of it	Hwɛ so yiye .
It is almost invisible.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obi ntumi nhu.
You wanted to be good with him.	Ná wopɛ sɛ wo ne no yɛ papa.
Surely there was something he could have done to save the man's life.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, na biribi wɔ hɔ a anka obetumi ayɛ de agye ɔbarima no nkwa.
This meant there was some interest.	Ná eyi kyerɛ sɛ na anigye bi wɔ hɔ.
There is something here.	Biribi wɔ ha.
Wear warm clothes.	Hyɛ ntade a ɛyɛ hyew.
That was no problem.	Ná ɛno nyɛ ɔhaw biara.
At least not that much.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ pii saa.
Or they shouldn’t.	Anaasɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
This is for me, the end.	Eyi ne ma me, awiei no.
This gives	Eyi ma .
Raise your hand if you know anything about the story.	Sɛ wunim asɛm no ho biribi a, ma wo nsa so.
I want it to be real.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
That was not what he needed to hear.	Ná ɛnyɛ saa asɛm a na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte.
It happened about a week ago.	Esii bɛyɛ dapɛn biako a atwam ni.
That doesn’t matter.	Ɛno nyɛ hwee.
His next film was a hit.	Ne sini a edi hɔ no ani gyee ho kɛse.
That was just part of it.	Ná ɛno yɛ ne fã bi kɛkɛ.
I have the power to make it happen.	Mewɔ tumi a mede bɛma ayɛ saa.
That, too, is clear.	Ɛno nso mu da hɔ.
A new car.	Kar foforo bi.
I hope you somehow knew that.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔkwan bi so no na wunim saa.
Take your time too.	Gye wo bere nso.
The windows looked out onto the street.	Ná mfɛnsere no hwɛ abɔnten so.
Half the city will be empty.	Kurow no mu fã bɛyɛ nea hwee nni mu.
The reason for this is deeply troubling.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no haw adwene kɛse.
The bus is late.	Bɔs no aka akyi.
Ultimately, this can help unify the three hands.	Awiei koraa no, eyi betumi aboa ma nsa abiɛsa no ayɛ biako.
Be careful now.	Hwɛ yiye mprempren.
He had been good at it.	Ná wayɛ obi a ne ho akokwaw wɔ mu.
The book comes into play.	Nhoma no ba asɛm no mu.
There was nothing left for him.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a aka ama no.
Just play around .	Di agoru ara kwa .
And make it quick.	Na ma ɛnyɛ ntɛm.
Or anyone else.	Anaasɛ obi foforo biara.
This is not about me.	Eyi nyɛ me ho asɛm.
Not that it matters to me.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛho hia me.
Or something will go wrong.	Anaasɛ biribi bɛkɔ bɔne mu.
Just to add a bit of information.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wode nsɛm kakra bɛka ho ara kwa.
There are some good things.	Nneɛma pa bi wɔ hɔ.
I wanted something else.	Ná mepɛ biribi foforo.
But no one wants him on their team.	Nanso obiara mpɛ no wɔ wɔn kuw no mu.
I hope there are no mistakes.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mfomso biara nni ho.
I wish I could.	Me yam a, mepɛ.
And you’re not the same guy.	Na wo nso wonyɛ ɔbarima koro no ara.
Those are complicated things.	Ɛno yɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ den.
But don’t tell me what you can do.	Nanso nka nea wubetumi ayɛ nkyerɛ me.
The animal poses no danger to humans.	Aboa no mfa asiane biara mma nnipa.
Neither way applies to me.	Ɔkwan abien no nyinaa mfa me ho.
In this way, the work goes faster.	Saa kwan yi so no, adwuma no kɔ so ntɛmntɛm.
If only this had happened a few hours ago.	Sɛ eyi sii nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi a atwam ni a.
I felt terrible for him.	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ hu ma no.
Keep ingredients moving quickly.	Ma nneɛma a wode bɛyɛ aduan no nkɔ ntɛmntɛm.
And you are the only one .	Na wo nkutoo na woyɛ .
I am not good at this.	Menyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw wɔ eyi mu.
It’s going to go to school.	Ɛrekɔ so akɔ sukuu.
Get involved at home.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu wɔ fie.
Water is essential for life.	Nsu ho hia ma nkwa.
Something had obviously gone wrong.	Ɛda adi sɛ na biribi anyɛ yiye.
However, there are some things that seem good.	Nanso, nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛte sɛ nea eye.
He certainly doesn’t want to date for dinner.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔne obi bɛbɔ anwummere aduan.
It’s expensive.	Ɛyɛ nea ne bo yɛ den.
I could take her home right now.	Ná metumi de no akɔ fie mprempren ara.
And everyone believed in him.	Na obiara gyee no dii.
The girl is not what she seems.	Abeawa no nyɛ nea ɔte sɛ nea ɔyɛ.
But money remained a problem.	Nanso sika kɔɔ so yɛɛ ɔhaw.
I had to sleep.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meda.
He just didn't know what to do with it all.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛyɛ wɔ ne nyinaa ho ara kwa.
Before long, though, things start to get complicated.	Nanso, bere tiaa bi mu no, nneɛma fi ase yɛ den.
His mother was soft on him.	Ná ne maame yɛ mmerɛw wɔ ne ho.
For a whole week.	Dapɛn mũ nyinaa.
And it’s your favorite.	Na ɛyɛ nea w’ani gye ho paa.
Probably too many.	Ebia pii dodo.
That’s their fault, right?	Ɛno ne wɔn mfomso, ɛnte saa?
Neither did my father.	Saa ara na me papa nso anyɛ saa.
He did so without much hope.	Ɔyɛɛ saa a na onni anidaso kɛse biara.
I could watch for hours and hours.	Ná metumi ahwɛ nnɔnhwerew ne nnɔnhwerew pii.
It’s a beautiful night.	Ɛyɛ anadwo a ɛyɛ fɛ.
He has to do some.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ bi.
Must have a car obviously.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔwɔ kar a ɛda adi sɛ.
He was no longer there.	Ná onni hɔ bio.
This is already happening.	Eyi rekɔ so dedaw.
You should see it here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu wɔ ha.
It’s a wonderful story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
However, the bridge was still very difficult.	Nanso, na abɔnten so kwan no da so ara yɛ den yiye.
But it hardly does.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
Something had to be done about it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi.
Clearly, this was an important time.	Ɛda adi sɛ na eyi yɛ bere a ɛho hia.
He didn't want to worry, but it wasn't for him.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔhaw ne ho, nanso na ɛnyɛ ne de.
He could taste it.	Ná obetumi aka ahwɛ.
It’s not that much.	Ɛnyɛ pii saa.
Do what you want.	Yɛ nea wopɛ.
If he had something to say, he said it.	Sɛ ɔwɔ asɛm bi ka a, na ɔka.
That’s something.	Ɛno yɛ biribi.
No one can touch it.	Obiara ntumi mfa ne nsa nka.
But you can’t do that.	Nanso worentumi nyɛ saa.
Consider my gun.	Susuw me tuo no ho hwɛ.
She had a hard time planning and organizing a big party	Ná ɛyɛ den ma no sɛ ɔbɛyɛ apontow kɛse bi ho nhyehyɛe na wayɛ ho nhyehyɛe
I don’t want to do these things.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa nneɛma yi.
He was so very present.	Ná ɔyɛ saa a ɔwɔ hɔ kɛse no.
His wife committed the same sin.	Ne yere nso yɛɛ bɔne saa ara.
It’s really, really, really good.	Ɛyɛ ade pa ankasa, eye ankasa, ankasa.
All the rest of it.	Nea aka no nyinaa.
It is very important.	Ɛho hia kɛse.
The man's face was stern.	Ná ɔbarima no anim yɛ den.
He loved to party.	Ná n’ani gye apontow ho.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani gye ho ankasa.
Everything is happening fast.	Biribiara rekɔ so ntɛmntɛm.
But in this case.	Nanso wɔ eyi mu no.
This money is fake.	Saa sika yi yɛ atoro.
So did I, too.	Saa ara na me nso.
I have been here for a month.	Mewɔ ha ɔsram biako ni.
Get your hair out of the way.	Yi wo ti nhwi fi kwan no so.
He was always busy.	Ná onni adagyew bere nyinaa.
I look down.	Mehwɛ fam.
Two years ago.	Mfe abien a atwam ni.
Same thing last weekend at home.	Ade koro no ara dapɛn awiei a etwaam no wɔ fie.
Where he knew he was.	Baabi a na onim sɛ ɔwɔ.
And he took her to his room.	Na ɔde no kɔɔ ne dan mu.
He had a sense of right and wrong.	Ná ɔwɔ papa ne bɔne ho adwene.
It works for everyone.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ma obiara.
There was nothing spectacular about it.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a wɔka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Put me to sleep soundly.	Fa me to hɔ ma meda yiye.
If it’s too good to be true, it likely is.	Sɛ eye dodo sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nokware a, ɛda adi sɛ ɛte saa.
I could keep taking care of myself.	Ná metumi akɔ so ahwɛ me ho.
There was an opportunity.	Na hokwan bi wɔ hɔ.
Say he was in pain.	Ka sɛ na odi yaw.
But we have to do this.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ eyi.
We can do that at any time.	Yebetumi ayɛ saa bere biara.
Trust me, no one can think like you.	Gye me di, obiara ntumi nsusuw nneɛma ho te sɛ wo.
A city full of double prices.	Kurow a nneɛma bo abien ahyɛ mu ma.
Put the dog down.	Fa ɔkraman no to hɔ.
I believe it is a mistake.	Migye di sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
I think only one of them is a monster.	Misusuw sɛ wɔn mu biako pɛ na ɔyɛ aboa kɛse.
I can’t do it.	Mintumi nyɛ.
And everything surprised me.	Na biribiara yɛɛ me nwonwa.
I’ve always admired my mother.	M’ani gye me maame ho bere nyinaa.
There were no police at all.	Ná polisifo biara nni hɔ koraa.
He looked at me thoughtfully.	Ɔde adwene hwɛɛ me.
We all had a wonderful time!	Yɛn nyinaa nyaa bere a ɛyɛ anigye!
Everyone has to accept it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara gye tom.
Hopefully we can make that easier.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ yebetumi ama ɛno ayɛ mmerɛw.
I shouldn’t use it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ mede di dwuma.
I’m really excited.	M’ani agye ankasa.
Maybe he didn’t.	Ebia na ɔnyɛ saa.
Determine your population.	Kyerɛ wo nnipa dodow.
Too hard, too full of himself.	Ɔde den dodo, ne ho ahyɛ no ma dodo.
On the floor.	Wɔ fam hɔ.
Not much at all.	Ɛnyɛ pii koraa.
The drought has made many people uncomfortable.	Ɔpɛ no ama nnipa pii ani nnye ho.
He just used it.	Ɔde dii dwuma ara kwa.
We are one.	Yɛyɛ biako.
In the years that followed, the population continued to grow.	Wɔ mfe a edi hɔ no mu no, nnipa dodow kɔɔ so yɛɛ kɛse.
I trust you completely.	Mede me ho to wo so koraa.
It was like a prison.	Ná ɛte sɛ afiase.
I still don’t understand what happened.	Meda so ara nte nea esii no ase.
It’s pretty amazing, really.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye, ampa.
I wanted her to be happy.	Ná mepɛ sɛ n’ani gye.
I'm pretty sure it was him.	Migye di yiye sɛ na ɛyɛ ɔno.
Mary walks inside.	Maria nantew kɔ mu.
You have to think too much.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw nneɛma ho dodo.
Maybe not all of it.	Ebia ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa.
They have to be part of the plan.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe no fã.
But nothing is ever that simple.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa da.
In this picture.	Wɔ saa mfonini yi mu.
He didn’t have much himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa nni nneɛma pii.
Take it now.	Fa no mprempren.
There is no problem.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
He lived in a creepy old house.	Ná ɔte ofie dedaw bi a ɛyɛ hu mu.
It wasn’t a lie.	Ná ɛnyɛ atoro.
They are just two parts of one whole.	Wɔyɛ ade mũ biako no fã abien ara kwa.
He was a test of that hope.	Ná ɔyɛ saa anidaso no ho sɔhwɛ.
Remember how it feels.	Kae sɛnea ɛte nka no.
All systems go.	Nhyehyɛe ahorow nyinaa kɔ.
But it was too soon for that.	Nanso na ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo ama ɛno.
The water was warm and moving incredibly fast.	Ná nsu no mu yɛ hyew na ɛrekɔ ntɛmntɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It’s cold outside!	Awɔw wɔ abɔnten!
Over and over and over again.	Mpɛn pii ne mpɛn pii.
No one system is ideal or perfect.	Nhyehyɛe biako biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ papa anaa edi mũ.
That’s not just bad planning.	Ɛno nyɛ nhyehyɛe bɔne ara kwa.
This is their job.	Eyi ne wɔn adwuma.
Everyone in this house has to work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara a ɔwɔ fie yi mu yɛ adwuma.
It sounds complicated, but it really isn’t.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den, nanso ɛnyɛ saa ankasa.
It was an overcrowded bus.	Ná ɛyɛ bɔs a nnipa ahyɛ mu ma dodo.
The moon is visible tonight.	Ɔsram no da adi anadwo yi.
It’s not easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
We finally got him here.	Awiei koraa no yɛde no baa ha.
The error just doesn’t add up.	Mfomso no nka ho kɛkɛ.
Like, really quick.	Te sɛ, ntɛm ankasa.
He looks like a child.	Ɔte sɛ abofra.
The system is simple.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛ mmerɛw.
I didn’t know what the situation was.	Ná minnim sɛnea tebea no te.
I keep running into mistakes.	Mekɔ so tu mmirika kɔ mfomso ahorow mu.
I'm so glad people like it.	M'ani agye yiye sɛ nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
You can’t do things.	Worentumi nyɛ nneɛma.
Fear of everything.	Biribiara ho suro.
I wanted to thank you.	Na mepɛ sɛ meda me ase.
The house is very nicely furnished.	Ofie no mu nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He had been shown a picture.	Ná wɔde mfonini akyerɛ no.
That must have been great.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛno yɛ kɛse.
This is where there are few problems with the system.	Eyi ne baabi a ɔhaw kakraa bi na ɛwɔ nhyehyɛe no mu.
I didn’t know where he was.	Ná minnim baabi a ɔwɔ.
He won many times with his mental powers.	Ɔde n’adwene tumi dii nkonim mpɛn pii.
He is very strong.	Ɔyɛ den yiye.
Play with them on a piece of paper.	Di agoru a wɔde wɔn ahyɛ krataa bi so.
However, it is a great investment.	Nanso, ɛyɛ sika a wɔde hyɛ mu kɛse.
It just isn’t happening.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
His mother, too.	Ne maame nso.
Maybe he was the one.	Ebia na ɔte saa.
And maybe it isn’t.	Na ebia ɛnte saa.
Just put in like all your information.	Fa wo ho nsɛm te sɛ ne nyinaa hyɛ mu kɛkɛ.
I do enjoy watching it more.	M’ani gye ho kɛse sɛ mehwɛ no ampa.
Nothing interesting happened.	Biribiara a ɛyɛ anigye amma.
If you are not doing one you are doing the other.	Sɛ wonyɛ biako a woreyɛ biako no.
I have a couple of new ones.	Mewɔ foforo abien bi.
I have been doing this for a long time.	Meyɛ eyi akyɛ.
If only it were that simple.	Sɛ anka ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa a.
In the inside of the.	Wɔ mu no.
You may not feel well if you are allergic.	Ebia wo ho nyɛ wo den sɛ wo ho yɛ wo hyew a.
That too outside the home.	Ɛno nso wɔ fie akyi.
I hoped no one heard.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ obiara nte.
After that, it doesn’t.	Ɛno akyi no, ɛnyɛ saa.
I can only talk about them.	Wɔn ho asɛm nkutoo na metumi aka.
As a system, it works extremely well.	Sɛ́ nhyehyɛe no, ɛyɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
The view of things.	Nneɛma ho adwene.
However, this is a harmless mistake.	Nanso, eyi yɛ mfomso a asiane biara nni ho.
That is true now.	Ɛno yɛ nokware mprempren.
They are quite complex.	Wɔyɛ nea ɛyɛ den koraa.
I can solve problems.	Metumi adi ɔhaw ahorow ho dwuma.
That would have been good.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ nea eye.
I think they are wrong.	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ mfomso.
Don't turn me on, man.	Mma me dan me, ɔbarima.
Each comes half the time.	Biara ba bere no fã.
To him, the dog is a dangerous animal.	Wɔ ne fam no, ɔkraman yɛ aboa a ne ho yɛ hu.
No one really knows how they work, or why they work.	Obiara nnim sɛnea wɔyɛ adwuma ankasa, anaa nea enti a wɔyɛ adwuma no.
This is only partially true.	Eyi yɛ nokware fã bi pɛ.
I really don’t like him going with one other person either.	M’ani nnye ho ankasa sɛ ɔne onipa foforo biako nso bɛkɔ.
It might be interesting.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
Just one night.	Anadwo biako pɛ.
I don’t like planning.	M’ani nnye nhyehyɛe ho.
There is a problem.	Ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
This really hit home for me today.	Eyi bɔɔ me ankasa wɔ fie nnɛ.
None of them are there.	Wɔn mu biara nni hɔ.
Play some music.	Bɔ nnwom bi.
Not interesting enough.	Ɛnyɛ anigye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Other than that, there really is nothing.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, biribiara nni hɔ ankasa.
I think he does, a little bit.	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛ, kakra.
It was a story that had to be told.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka.
I have to stay with you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo tra.
Here he is.	Ɔno ni.
Stay as long as you want.	Tra hɔ bere tenten a wopɛ.
I had to feel it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mete nka.
I’m very excited about it.	M’ani gyee ho yiye.
It has been used effectively in this case.	Wɔde adi dwuma yiye wɔ asɛm yi mu.
Maybe it will be.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
He moved away from the table.	Ɔde ne ho fii pon no so.
It would have been difficult.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ den.
That’s all from us here.	Ɛno nyinaa fi yɛn hɔ wɔ ha.
That is over now.	Ɛno aba awiei mprempren.
I can tell you whatever it is.	Metumi aka nea ɛyɛ biara akyerɛ wo.
I’m not very interested in trends.	M’ani nnye nneɛma a ɛrekɔ so ho kɛse.
But the story is not about that.	Nanso asɛm no mfa saa asɛm no ho.
First, describe the animal.	Nea edi kan no, ka aboa no ho asɛm.
You need to know that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu saa.
I will give this to you.	Mede eyi bɛma wo.
It’s still happening though.	Ɛda so ara rekɔ so de, nanso.
It’s still the same.	Ɛda so ara te saa.
No good comes from the bad.	Pa biara mfi bɔne no mu.
It was a wonderful time of year.	Ná ɛyɛ afe no mu bere a ɛyɛ anigye.
He’s interested in a lot of things.	N’ani gye nneɛma pii ho.
I was stronger than that.	Ná me ho yɛ den sen saa.
So take advantage of the time.	Enti fa bere no di dwuma.
Not enough of that.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso saa.
He had carried it all his life.	Ná ɔde akɔ ne nkwa nna nyinaa mu.
In most cases.	Mpɛn pii no.
That’s how people are.	Saa na nnipa te.
My mother told me last year.	Me maame ka kyerɛɛ me afe a etwaam no.
This was like a first.	Ná eyi te sɛ nea edi kan.
Just not the best.	Kɛkɛ, ɛnyɛ nea eye sen biara.
I really like the idea.	M’ani gye adwene no ho ankasa.
It’s unlike anything else out there.	Ɛnte sɛ biribi foforo biara a ɛwɔ abɔnten hɔ.
It’s as simple and complex as that.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ den te sɛ ɛno.
He tells her right.	Ɔka kyerɛ no yiye.
This cannot be the case.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ saa.
But it is built on certain things.	Nanso wɔde asi nneɛma bi so.
Like you don’t want to be here.	Te sɛ nea wompɛ sɛ wowɔ ha.
If only that were the case for all of us.	Sɛ anka ɛte saa wɔ yɛn nyinaa fam a.
It was quite the year.	Ná ɛyɛ afe no ankasa.
You really have to wonder what the bottom line is.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho ankasa sɛ dɛn ne asɛm a ɛwɔ ase no.
This method is dangerous.	Saa kwan yi yɛ hu.
I’m really enjoying this.	M’ani agye eyi ho ankasa.
I think that’s a bad thing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ ade bɔne.
But, again, this is part of the language.	Nanso, bio, eyi yɛ kasa a wɔka no fã.
I find that very interesting.	Mihu sɛ ɛno yɛ anigye yiye.
Good food too.	Aduan pa nso.
I can’t see it for sure.	Me ntumi nhu no yiye.
There is a strange story going on.	Asɛm bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa rekɔ so.
It’s not that great of a car either.	Ɛnyɛ kar kɛse saa nso.
However, there is still much to be done.	Nanso, nneɛma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Let me think about that.	Ma minsusuw saa asɛm no ho.
I notice that one of my legs is still hot.	Mihu sɛ me nan biako da so ara yɛ hyew.
You and I, and it could still happen.	Me ne wo, na ɛda so ara betumi aba.
I’m sorry to say that.	Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ meka saa.
Remember, we have one thing in common.	Kae sɛ yɛwɔ ade biako a ɛho hia.
Everyone could feel it.	Ná obiara tumi te nka.
It’s been so long.	Akyɛ saa.
However, it may be.	Nanso, ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
For the new film.	Wɔ sini foforo no ho.
You are the boy’s father.	Wo ne abarimaa no papa.
Work in me.	Yɛ adwuma wɔ me mu.
The same is true.	Saa ara na ɛte.
Naturally, the ending was not good.	Sɛnea ɛte no, na awiei no nyɛ papa.
I told him again.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​bio.
His touch made her feel all over again.	Nea ɔde ne nsa kaa no no maa ne nyinaa ho yɛɛ no ​​yaw bio.
The same goes for input.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nsɛm a wɔde hyɛ mu no ho.
We are equal in our abilities.	Yɛyɛ pɛ wɔ yɛn tumi a yɛde yɛ adwuma no mu.
That was good and bad.	Ná ɛno yɛ papa ne bɔne.
Maybe there’s an opportunity there.	Ebia hokwan bi wɔ hɔ wɔ hɔ.
You should know that too.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso wuhu saa.
I need to see if the team is doing well.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ sɛ ebia kuw no reyɛ adwuma yiye anaa.
But it’s not that simple.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
After the first time it gets easier.	Bere a edi kan no akyi no ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Only what you are working on.	Nea woreyɛ ho adwuma no nkutoo.
He hasn't worked in years.	Ɔnyɛ adwuma mfe pii ni.
This is the same for us.	Eyi te saa ara wɔ yɛn fam.
School was not the same.	Ná sukuu nyɛ ade koro.
Completely, completely wrong.	Mfomso koraa, koraa.
Here's an idea.	Adwene bi ni.
Nothing went wrong.	Biribiara ankɔ bɔne.
But it’s simple at the same time.	Nanso ɛyɛ mmerɛw bere koro no ara mu.
I want to give my all to you.	Mepɛ sɛ mede me nyinaa ma mo.
It would have been difficult.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ den.
But this doesn’t feel like the whole truth.	Nanso eyi nte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware no nyinaa.
But most of it is the money.	Nanso ne fã kɛse no ara yɛ sika no.
This is one of the best.	Eyi yɛ nea eye sen biara no mu biako.
I don't know if he was there or not.	Minnim sɛ ebia na ɔwɔ hɔ anaasɛ na ɔte saa.
I think she is really beautiful.	Misusuw sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
They were told when to work and what to do.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ wɔn bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Use their words, not your own.	Fa wɔn nsɛm di dwuma, na ɛnyɛ wo de.
The defendants took it upon themselves.	Wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho too wɔn so no faa no kɔɔ so.
I had no plans.	Ná minni nhyehyɛe biara.
But in general, you really do.	Nanso wɔ asɛm no nyinaa mu no, woyɛ saa ankasa.
It sounds like a good, simple plan is often the best.	Ɛte sɛ nhyehyɛe pa, a ɛnyɛ den taa yɛ nea eye sen biara.
He wants to have lunch with you too.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne wo nso di awia aduan.
They are a great team.	Wɔyɛ kuw kɛse bi.
You don’t know how much.	Wunnim dodow a ɛdɔɔso.
At the edge of the error.	Wɔ mfomso no ano.
He loved sex.	Ná n’ani gye nna ho.
The people thought otherwise.	Nkurɔfo no susuwii sɛ ɛnte saa.
I liked the first one, no story was just good enough for me.	M’ani gyee nea edi kan no ho, asɛm biara nni hɔ a na eye ma me kɛkɛ.
Everyone already knows you should.	Obiara nim dedaw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
What kind of food is this?	Aduan bɛn na eyi yɛ?
I look forward to another meeting with them.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ me ne wɔn bɛyɛ nhyiam foforo.
Every girl would want to do it.	Abeawa biara bɛpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no.
He was not unfamiliar with himself, or with me.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a onnim ne ho, anaasɛ me ho.
People even take the stuff inside.	Nkurɔfo mpo fa nneɛma no kɔ mu.
I squinted at him.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ no.
It seemed perfect.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea edi mũ.
It would have been.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
No one seems to care.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara mfa ne ho.
However, not everyone likes us.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ obiara na n’ani gye yɛn ho.
A number of heads veered our way.	Ti dodow bi dan kɔɔ yɛn kwan so.
People drive that way any real time.	Nkurɔfo de kar ka saa kwan no so ankasa biara.
He barely had time for that, even.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na onni bere mma saa, mpo.
At least it’s not very obvious.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nea ɛda adi kɛse.
I don’t want to go.	Mempɛ sɛ mekɔ.
Maybe it was my problem.	Ebia na ɛyɛ me haw.
I didn’t know that either.	Ná minnim saa nso.
He’s interested in it.	N’ani gye ho.
You know, myself.	Wunim, me ankasa no.
The mind is going on.	Adwene a ɛrekɔ so.
Not much else.	Ɛnyɛ nneɛma foforo pii.
That’s the hardest one.	Ɛno ne nea ɛyɛ den yiye.
His feet are delightful.	Ne nan yɛ anigye.
There was no hope for these two.	Ná anidaso biara nni saa baanu yi.
Assume he has a lot to do with it.	Fa no sɛ ɔwɔ pii yɛ wɔ ho.
As he wished.	Sɛnea na ɔpɛ no.
The same is true here.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ ha nso.
Projects in the next two to three years.	Nnwuma wɔ mfe abien kosi abiɛsa a edi hɔ no mu.
I don’t know what it would be.	Minnim nea anka ɛbɛyɛ.
So many things to do.	Enti nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
The child is only half of me.	Abofra no yɛ me fã pɛ.
Everything was still beautiful.	Ná biribiara da so ara yɛ fɛ.
This morning has been really easy.	Anɔpa yi ayɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
It just seemed like enough.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛdɔɔso ara kwa.
He knew better now.	Ná onim yiye mprempren.
Using it will be even harder.	Sɛ wode bedi dwuma a, ɛbɛyɛ den kɛse mpo.
Her mom is one of my mom’s best friends.	Ne maame yɛ me maame nnamfo paa no mu biako.
Have no problems with them.	Wo ne wɔn nnya ɔhaw biara.
But only you can do it.	Nanso wo nkutoo na wubetumi ayɛ.
Time to think is important.	Bere a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho ho hia.
And there are good ones.	Na wɔn a wɔyɛ papa nso wɔ hɔ.
Now everything is working as it should.	Seesei biribiara reyɛ adwuma sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
Not if you don’t want to.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ wompɛ a.
The man was amazing.	Ná ɔbarima no ho yɛ nwonwa.
I love the wonderful surprises in this book.	M’ani gye nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛwɔ nhoma yi mu no ho.
School seemed more fun, friends seemed less strange.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea sukuu yɛ anigye kɛse, na ɛte sɛ nea nnamfo nyɛ nwonwa kɛse.
At home, too.	Wɔ fie nso.
Pretty much the same, anyway.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte saa ara, sɛnea ɛte biara.
Everyone except us.	Obiara gye yɛn nkutoo.
The product is much cheaper here.	Ade no bo yɛ mmerɛw kɛse wɔ ha.
Take what is offered to you.	Fa nea wɔde ma wo no.
I didn’t want to thank this man anymore.	Na mempɛ sɛ meda ɔbarima yi ase bio.
I don’t like music like that at all.	Nnwom a ɛte saa no nnye m’ani koraa.
He was just a really nice guy.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa ara kwa.
What a lot of fun it was.	Hwɛ sɛnea na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
It has a role to play.	Ɛwɔ dwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ edi.
He wasn’t happy about it.	Na n’ani nnye ho wɔ ho.
There is nothing left of it.	Biribiara nni hɔ a aka wɔ ho.
Or, at least, most of them had.	Anaasɛ, anyɛ yiye koraa no, na wɔn mu dodow no ara wɔ saa.
I was a man.	Ná meyɛ ɔbarima.
We put down a portion of everything we owned.	Yɛde biribiara a yɛwɔ no fã bi too hɔ.
Interesting, but not his problem.	Anigye, nanso ɛnyɛ ne haw no.
And I do, of course.	Na meyɛ, ampa.
You’ve done that.	Woayɛ saa.
But you just can’t do that.	Nanso worentumi nyɛ saa ara.
The weakest of them.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ mmerɛw no.
The thing was about perfect.	Ná ade no reyɛ ayɛ pɛ.
Pictures are not necessary, but they are ideal.	Mfonini ho nhia, nanso ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
The situation is more complicated.	Tebea no mu yɛ den sen saa.
It was pretty quick.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛm yiye.
It seemed so old.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea akyɛ yiye.
Even if you can.	Sɛ wubetumi mpo a.
Maybe it was the situation.	Ebia na ɛyɛ tebea no.
They do an important job.	Wɔyɛ adwuma bi a ɛho hia.
We police ourselves, rather than having to be policed.	Yɛn ankasa yɛ polisifo, sen sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ polisifo.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
It’s not something you can wear.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a wubetumi ahyɛ.
You get everything.	Wo nsa ka biribiara.
For many it is difficult.	Nnipa pii ɛyɛ den.
He is short and strong.	Ɔyɛ tiaa na ne ho yɛ den.
But it wasn’t a car.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ kar.
Saying what I want to say.	Nea mepɛ sɛ meka no a mɛka.
Animals are treated better than people in this city.	Wɔyɛ mmoa ho adwuma yiye sen nnipa wɔ kurow yi mu.
Just a general idea .	Adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa ara kwa .
There are no end dates.	Nna a wɔde bɛba awiei no bi nni hɔ.
However, there is a downside to this.	Nanso, ade bɔne bi wɔ eyi ho.
What is important	Nea ɛho hia .
However, everyone agrees that something needs to be done.	Nanso, obiara gye tom sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi.
I can't see it clearly.	Mintumi nhu no yiye.
Whatever you think.	Nea wususuw biara.
But it is not at all.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
That’s just not realistic.	Ɛno nyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware ara kwa.
And the house, too.	Na ofie no nso.
It doesn’t really matter.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia ankasa.
I just need to know what has happened.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea akɔ so ara kwa.
I really think something is wrong.	Misusuw ankasa sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye.
We were too young.	Ná yɛyɛ mmofra dodo.
You both make me think.	Mo baanu nyinaa ma misusuw nneɛma ho.
You know how those things go.	Wunim sɛnea saa nneɛma no kɔ.
He was very impressed with his talk.	N’ani gyee ne kasa no ho kɛse.
It’s as simple as that and as hard as that.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ ɛno na ɛyɛ den te sɛ ɛno.
Everything was part of his plan.	Ná biribiara yɛ ne nhyehyɛe no fã.
However, it is not.	Nanso, ɛnte saa.
It was a good game.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru pa.
It’s never easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw da.
Nothing had ever worked.	Ná biribiara nyɛɛ adwuma da.
A few more words, and here he is.	Nsɛm kakraa bi bio, na ɔno nso ni.
Our image is everything.	Yɛn mfonini no yɛ biribiara.
I’m not nearly that excited anymore.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ m’ani nnye saa bio.
So he wasn’t doing that.	Enti na ɔnyɛ saa.
It needs to be talked about and it needs to be talked about.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka ho asɛm na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka ho asɛm.
For the project.	Wɔ adwuma no ho.
These people.	Saa nnipa yi.
So that was hard for him.	Enti na ɛno yɛ den ma no.
You only got one chance.	Wo nsa kaa hokwan biako pɛ.
A night to remember.	Anadwo a ɛsɛ sɛ wokae.
After a year or so, he was forgotten.	Afe biako anaa nea ɛte saa akyi no, wɔn werɛ fii ne ho.
Close the door.	To ɔpon no mu.
It’s true for me.	Ɛyɛ nokware ma me.
And we can look at that.	Na yebetumi ahwɛ saa asɛm no.
I have to tell you again.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo bio.
Focus on me.	Fa adwene hyɛ me so.
Something moves closer to him.	Biribi tu bɛn no.
It was very good.	Ná eye paa.
In the summer.	Wɔ awɔw bere mu.
Here’s a way to do it.	Ɔkwan bi ni.
Or not so much anyway.	Anaasɛ ɔkwan biara so no, ɛnyɛ pii saa.
This is the background.	Eyi ne akyi no.
I don’t know how it works, but it works.	Minnim sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma, nanso ɛyɛ adwuma.
He told her that, many times.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​saa, mpɛn pii.
Let everyone know.	Ma obiara nhu.
Nothing is as it seems.	Biribiara nte sɛnea ɛte no.
But it’s amazing.	Nanso ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
Right now.	Bere yi ara.
We are next in line.	Yɛn na edi hɔ.
They say it isn’t.	Wɔka sɛ ɛnte saa.
That was a long time.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere tenten.
Everyone knows them.	Obiara nim wɔn.
We are too weak.	Yɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
He glanced at his mother.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ne maame so.
Things are much easier now.	Nneɛma ayɛ mmerɛw kɛse mprempren.
His head was throbbing violently.	Ná ne ti rebɔ denneennen.
The city was starting to catch up with him.	Ná kurow no afi ase rekɔ ne nkyɛn.
The party was new.	Ná apontow no yɛ foforo.
I feel every hour I travel.	Mete nnɔnhwerew biara a mede tu kwan no nka.
The animal is in danger.	Aboa no wɔ asiane mu.
It was the book he wanted.	Ná ɛyɛ nhoma a na ɔpɛ no.
This is a lot of work, trust me.	Eyi yɛ adwuma pii, gye me di.
He must have had one.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɔwɔ bi.
And it was a great one.	Na ɛyɛ kɛse.
And I have done the same for work.	Na saa ara na mayɛ ama adwuma.
He knew what he had to do.	Ná onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
These days, most people work for themselves.	Nna yi, nnipa dodow no ara yɛ adwuma ma wɔn ho.
They say we can bring all our stuff, too.	Wɔka sɛ yebetumi de yɛn nneɛma nyinaa aba, nso.
And we were rare.	Na yɛn ho yɛ na.
It had been another really good day.	Ná ayɛ da foforo a eye ankasa.
He joined in again this morning.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu bio anɔpa yi.
I did that for a year.	Meyɛɛ saa afe biako.
Everything was exciting.	Ná biribiara yɛ anigye.
Walked away from the project.	Nantew fii adwuma no ho.
It was a perfect day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a edi mũ.
I completely forgot about work.	Me werɛ fii adwuma koraa.
Thank you for everything you have given me.	Meda wo ase wɔ biribiara a wode ama me no ho.
This information is provided for reference purposes only.	Wɔde saa nsɛm yi ama sɛ nneɛma a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma nkutoo.
He had no authority to carry the whole thing.	Ná onni tumi biara sɛ ɔde asɛm no nyinaa bɛkɔ.
Give of yourself when you can.	Fa wo ho ma bere a wubetumi.
The same goes for lunch.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ awia aduan ho.
This information is free for anyone to use.	Saa nsɛm yi yɛ nea obiara betumi de adi dwuma kwa.
Details of the time will come alongside the date.	Bere no ho nsɛm bɛba da no nkyɛn.
Or so it seemed to me, at the time.	Anaasɛ saa na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ me, wɔ saa bere no mu.
Our next meeting is next month.	Yɛn nhyiam a edi hɔ no yɛ ɔsram a edi hɔ no.
Their hands are full.	Wɔn nsa ayɛ ma.
And first of all, there was the man himself.	Na nea edi kan koraa no, na ɔbarima no ankasa wɔ hɔ.
He touched the doorknob.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ɔpon no ano.
This is the last day at work.	Eyi ne da a etwa to wɔ adwumam.
He wasn't very happy with her either.	Ná ɔno nso ani nnye ne ho koraa.
Let’s enjoy the time we have left here.	Momma yɛn ani nnye bere a aka a yɛwɔ wɔ ha no ho.
He’s a squirrel.	Ɔyɛ ɔkraman.
He had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
However, two things are clear enough.	Nanso, nneɛma abien bi mu da hɔ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
That’s how we ended a project.	Saa na yɛde adwuma bi baa awiei.
He did a great job.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma kɛse.
The food looks amazing.	Aduan no hwɛ yɛ nwonwa.
He ran towards the bridge.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ abɔnten so kwan no so.
You can reach the below.	Wubetumi adu nea ɛwɔ ase ha no ho.
I knew then, if not who.	Ná minim saa bere no, sɛ ɛnyɛ hena a.
But that is not always the case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na asɛm no te saa.
, as and when needed.	, sɛnea ɛho hia ne bere a ɛho hia no.
He’s not the gun.	Ɔnyɛ tuo no.
Look at the kids.	Hwɛ mmofra no.
The hope is in a curriculum.	Anidaso no wɔ adesua nhyehyɛe bi mu.
You know this is the best.	Wunim sɛ eyi yɛ nea eye sen biara.
I don’t think it’s good.	Minsusuw sɛ eye.
His mother wanted him to do something.	Ná ne maame pɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
However, be very careful with this part.	Nanso, hwɛ yiye paa wɔ saa fã yi ho.
Friends know these things about each other.	Nnamfo nim saa nneɛma yi fa wɔn ho wɔn ho ho.
Thank you now.	Meda mo ase mprempren.
It was easy.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Just one of the first.	Nea edi kan no mu biako pɛ.
You have to get involved.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu.
I was very surprised at how hot he was.	Sɛnea na ne ho yɛ hyew no yɛɛ me nwonwa yiye.
But perhaps we shouldn’t have been so surprised.	Nanso ebia anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn nwonwa saa.
It certainly wasn’t here.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛnyɛ ha.
You can solve your real problem.	Wubetumi adi wo haw ankasa ho dwuma.
Everyone he is.	Obiara ɔno.
He is not alone in the story.	Ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na ɔka asɛm no.
Another letter fell out.	Krataa foforo nso hwee ase.
On the table.	Wɔ pon no so.
It doesn’t have to be much.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ pii.
This is a mistake.	Eyi yɛ mfomso.
There was no one else.	Ná obiara nka ho.
He has to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
It wasn’t the point.	Ná ɛnyɛ asɛm no.
You hope something goes away.	Wowɔ anidaso sɛ biribi bɛkɔ.
The scenery here is beautiful.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ ha no yɛ fɛ.
There didn't seem to be much.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ pii.
That’s the song.	Ɛno ne dwom no.
This he could handle, this was more like that.	Eyi a na obetumi adi ho dwuma, na eyi te sɛ ɛno kɛse.
According to the indication.	Sɛnea kyerɛ no.
He doesn’t need to say much.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɔka pii.
However, I will say this.	Nanso, mɛka eyi.
Think about what that means for you.	Susuw nea ɛno kyerɛ ma wo no ho.
At that time, there was no one	Saa bere no, na obiara nni hɔ
That’s what they use.	Ɛno ne nea wɔde di dwuma.
But the work thing is really hard.	Nanso adwuma ade no yɛ den ankasa.
Why should you do it.	Dɛn nti na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
All day long.	Da mũ nyinaa.
That is never in doubt.	Ɛno nyɛ nea akyinnye biara nni ho da.
Not one of them is here with you.	Wɔn mu biako mpo nka wo ho wɔ ha.
Nobody knows.	Obiara nnim.
You have to do your best.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nea wubetumi biara.
There were many of them.	Ná wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
I know more than you do.	Minim pii sen wo.
Make it happen.	Ma ɛnyɛ yiye.
The man always surprised her.	Ná ɔbarima no yɛ no nwonwa bere nyinaa.
I interfered as little as possible.	Mede me ho gyee nsɛm mu kakraa bi sɛnea metumi biara.
This is easy to do.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ eyi.
However, it is remarkable.	Nanso, ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Can someone please help me?.	Mesrɛ wo obi betumi aboa me?.
Expect the same.	Hwɛ kwan saa ara.
It’s a necessary thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛho hia.
I know him better than you do.	Minim no yiye sen mo.
And it wasn’t a person.	Na ɛnyɛ onipa bi.
But don’t get into any trouble.	Nanso nkɔ ɔhaw biara mu.
He has never played this game alone.	Ɔno nkutoo nyɛɛ saa agoru yi da.
It seemed to be good.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eye.
No one ever thought this would happen.	Ná obiara nsusuw ho da sɛ eyi bɛba.
Again, and again.	Bio nso, ne bio.
It’s not a power walk.	Ɛnyɛ tumi nantew.
Years later, my mother would call you by name.	Mfe pii akyi no, na me maame bɛbɔ wo din.
This may also affect the external validity of the study.	Eyi nso betumi aka adesua no mu nokware a ɛwɔ akyi no.
Look how beautiful everyone is.	Hwɛ sɛnea obiara ho yɛ fɛ.
When they do, it’s great.	Sɛ wɔyɛ a, ɛyɛ kɛse.
It’s too big for me.	Ɛyɛ kɛse dodo ma me.
It seemed to happen in a terrible accident.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea esii akwanhyia a ɛyɛ hu mu.
There was also a squirrel.	Na ɔkraman bi nso wɔ hɔ.
Maybe I should do that.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
But there are no people.	Nanso nnipa biara nni hɔ.
I’d love for you to do that.	M’ani begye ho sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
That’s what people say.	Saa na nkurɔfo ka.
A city outside of time.	Kurow a ɛwɔ bere akyi.
If you say that.	Sɛ woka saa a.
And he was doing that.	Na na ɔyɛ saa.
This is still a big deal.	Eyi da so ara yɛ asɛm kɛse.
I believe he was completely dropped.	Migye di sɛ wɔde no too hɔ koraa.
Give me one more day before you act.	Ma me da koro bio ansa na woayɛ ho biribi.
But the truth is never casual.	Nanso nokware no nyɛ nea wɔyɛ no kwa da.
But they are not perfect.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ pɛ.
Deal with any mistakes.	Di mfomso biara ho dwuma.
They ended your day.	Wɔde wo da no baa awiei.
The children were in the house.	Ná mmofra no wɔ fie hɔ.
Otherwise, the room was empty.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, na hwee nni dan no mu.
Lots of power available.	Tumi pii a ɛwɔ hɔ.
That’s what the song is.	Ɛno ne nea dwom no te.
He was on the phone.	Ná ɔwɔ telefon so.
Many had no idea.	Ná pii nni adwene.
Or not on me.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ me so.
But right now.	Nanso mprempren yi ara.
We have everything.	Yɛwɔ biribiara.
It was very cold that morning.	Ná awɔw wom kɛse saa anɔpa no.
There are two issues here.	Nsɛm abien na ɛwɔ ha.
So go big.	Enti kɔ kɛse.
He was not beautiful.	Ná ne ho nyɛ fɛ.
This new group of photos did not.	Saa mfonini kuw foforo yi anyɛ saa.
Now it seems unnecessary.	Seesei ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia.
He feels that his situation is hopeless.	Ɔte nka sɛ ne tebea no nni anidaso biara.
He is one of those people.	Ɔyɛ saa nnipa no mu biako.
He’s not that pretty.	Ɔnyɛ fɛ saa.
He wasn't that big.	Ná ɔnyɛ kɛse saa.
I didn’t know them.	Ná minnim wɔn.
This weekend was a lot of fun.	Saa dapɛn awiei yi yɛɛ anigye kɛse.
I understand you.	Mete wo ase.
I thought about that .	Misusuw saa asɛm no ho .
Both of these children survived.	Mmofra yi baanu nyinaa nyaa nkwa.
And it’s a great idea.	Na ɛyɛ adwene kɛse.
Everyone is excited.	Obiara ani agye.
And you know this.	Na wunim eyi.
Water actually flows under the bridge.	Nsu sen wɔ abɔnten so kwan no ase ankasa.
I didn’t know what it would be like.	Ná minnim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ.
Put yourself down.	Fa wo ho to fam.
The language comes to you very quickly after this.	Kasa no ba wo nkyɛn ntɛmntɛm yiye wɔ eyi akyi.
But there is a problem.	Nanso ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
It would be best right now.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ mprempren ara.
The man was the stronger.	Ná ɔbarima no na ne ho yɛ den sen no.
Think about what you are doing here.	Susuw nea woreyɛ wɔ ha no ho.
The terms and conditions.	Nsɛm ne nhyehyɛe ahorow no.
There is a lot of information in the book.	Nsɛm pii wɔ nhoma no mu.
It was only a short time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi pɛ.
This would be painful.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ yaw.
In the end, there was nothing to do.	Awiei koraa no, na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni saa asɛm no ho.
However, such a thing never existed.	Nanso, na ade a ɛte saa nni hɔ da.
It was neither too hard, nor too easy.	Ná ɛnyɛ den dodo, na saa ara nso na na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
Time is not money.	Bere nyɛ sika.
Mary, a lesbian, was always hopeful.	Ná Maria a ɔne ɔbarima da no wɔ anidaso bere nyinaa.
All things were possible.	Ná nneɛma nyinaa betumi ayɛ yiye.
There was some money.	Ná sika bi wɔ hɔ.
All the risks came true.	Asiane ahorow no nyinaa baa mu.
School could also greatly use more ideas.	Sukuu nso betumi de adwene pii adi dwuma kɛse.
You can’t talk your way out of this.	Worentumi nka wo kwan mfi eyi mu ho asɛm.
I wanted to thank you.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meda mo ase.
But there has to be something.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ.
You have brought this upon yourself.	Wode eyi aba wo ho so.
He obviously had most of that in mind.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔno na ɔwɔ saa adwene no mu dodow no ara.
They have to be told.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka.
Nothing is needed anymore.	Biribiara ho nhia bio.
There wasn't much to say.	Ná nneɛma pii nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka.
But this boy	Nanso abarimaa yi .
Things don’t always go wrong.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na nneɛma nkɔ bɔne.
The people began to sing.	Nkurɔfo no fii ase too dwom.
No pictures yet.	Mfonini biara nni hɔ de besi nnɛ.
I don’t think it matters one way or the other.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛho hia ɔkwan bi so anaa ɔkwan foforo so.
So, good job.	Enti, adwuma pa.
Put all your books on the table.	Fa wo nhoma nyinaa to pon no so.
I can handle that.	Metumi adi saa asɛm no ho dwuma.
What he wants doesn’t matter.	Nea ɔpɛ no mfa ho.
And so it was and that is the truth.	Na saa na na ɛte na ɛno ne nokware no.
I consider three of these interesting factors in some detail.	Misusuw nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye yi mu abiɛsa ho kɔ akyiri kakra.
Never assume you know everything or even enough.	Mfa no da sɛ wunim biribiara anaasɛ wunim nea ɛdɔɔso mpo.
And get out of here.	Na fi adi.
That felt like yesterday to me.	Ná ɛno te sɛ nnɛra ma me.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛte saa.
And sleep wasn’t easy for him.	Na nna anyɛ mmerɛw mma no.
However, not all of them.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ wɔn nyinaa.
The whole thing is really true.	Asɛm no nyinaa yɛ nokware ankasa.
But you can’t take them under your name.	Nanso worentumi mfa wɔn nkɔ wo din ase.
That’s the problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
I certainly hear you.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mete wo.
If we seem too small, we become dangerous.	Sɛ ɛte sɛ nea yɛyɛ kakraa bi dodo a, yɛbɛyɛ nea asiane wom.
We need to use some of your money to help.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde wo sika no bi yɛ mmoa.
They should be simple, yet elegant.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nea ɛnyɛ den, nanso ɛyɛ fɛ.
But there just never seemed to be a chance.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea hokwan biara nni hɔ da kɛkɛ.
They’re excited about how things are done.	Wɔn ani agye sɛnea wɔyɛ nneɛma ho.
His mother couldn’t.	Ne maame antumi.
It was nothing new at the time.	Ná ɛnyɛ ade foforo wɔ saa bere no mu.
It’s a complete lie.	Ɛyɛ atoro koraa.
He really liked her a lot more now.	Ná n’ani gye ne ho kɛse ankasa mprempren.
And you got to do it.	Na wo nyaa kwan yɛ.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnte saa.
This way, please.	Saa kwan yi so no, mesrɛ wo.
How time flies with friends.	Sɛnea bere tu ne nnamfo.
I wanted to know what it was like.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea ɛte.
I hope people give us a chance.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ nkurɔfo bɛma yɛn hokwan.
I can’t say where his mind went.	Mintumi nka baabi a n’adwene kɔɔ.
None of them saw me.	Wɔn mu biara anhu me.
We will do all that is necessary.	Yɛbɛyɛ nea ɛho hia nyinaa.
That is not our business.	Ɛno nyɛ yɛn asɛm.
Look how short his legs are.	Hwɛ sɛnea ne nan yɛ tiaa no.
Has he ever done that.	So wayɛ saa pɛn.
I took my son home.	Mede me ba no kɔɔ fie.
If it wasn’t you, it would be someone else.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ wo a, anka ɛyɛ obi foforo.
He was good to me.	Ná ɔyɛ papa ma me.
I really wanted a girl.	Ná mepɛ abeawa ankasa.
Besides, it’s their home.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɛyɛ wɔn fie.
His legs became stiff.	Ne nan mu yɛɛ den.
We can’t use him anymore.	Yɛrentumi mfa no nni dwuma bio.
And not recently.	Na ɛnyɛ nnansa yi ara.
Just put yourself down.	Fa wo ho to fam kɛkɛ.
There is no testing.	Sɔhwɛ biara nni hɔ.
So, I didn’t come.	Enti, nna amma.
That brought the story even closer.	Ɛno maa asɛm no bɛn wɔn mpo.
The power of that is immense.	Tumi a ɛwɔ saa asɛm no mu no yɛ kɛse.
This shouldn’t be surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa.
This article is obviously about the latter.	Ɛda adi sɛ saa asɛm yi fa nea etwa to no ho.
The day was very hot.	Ná da no mu yɛ hyew kɛse.
Certainly not.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnte saa.
You are not one of us.	Wonyɛ yɛn mu biako.
You want to put something in it.	Wopɛ sɛ wode biribi hyɛ mu.
No one got the other person.	Obiara nsa anka onipa foforo no.
Identify the important characteristics of your attributes.	Kyerɛ wo su ahorow a ɛho hia a ɛwɔ wo su ahorow no mu.
There are books in schools.	Nhoma ahorow wɔ sukuu ahorow mu.
And that’s just been going on.	Na ɛno akɔ so ara kwa.
The situation is powerful.	Tebea no wɔ tumi kɛse.
He is very honest.	Odi nokware paa.
All that matters is money.	Nea ɛho hia no ara ne sika.
He had reason to be happy.	Ná ɔwɔ nea enti a n’ani gye.
Go in or out.	Kɔ mu anaa fi adi.
He was sitting in the front row.	Na ɔte anim kwan no so.
So, that was a really interesting year.	Enti, na ɛno yɛ afe a ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
It’s a good job we have here.	Ɛyɛ adwuma pa a yɛwɔ ha.
Keep guessing, you don’t know.	Kɔ so susuw nneɛma ho, wunnim.
You know him better than anyone.	Wunim no yiye sen obiara.
You can tell him that it is absolutely true.	Wubetumi aka akyerɛ no sɛ ɛyɛ nokware koraa.
Should be a fun drive anyway.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye kar kwan biara so.
This story has always fascinated me.	Saa asɛm yi ama m’ani agye bere nyinaa.
He wanted to do that.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I am.	Meyɛ.
We both needed it.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa hia.
This is something that is important.	Eyi yɛ biribi a ɛho hia.
She is terribly beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu so.
That’s not the case for me.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte ma me.
It just isn’t that.	Ɛnyɛ saa ara kwa.
I was there too.	Ná me nso mewɔ hɔ.
See him at a party.	Hwɛ no wɔ apontow bi ase.
This year there were a couple of things I liked.	Afe yi nneɛma abien bi wɔ hɔ a m’ani gyee ho.
Don’t eat anything off the ground.	Nni biribiara mfi fam.
My mom told me that.	Me maame ka kyerɛɛ me saa.
Stay there for a while.	Tra hɔ kakra.
Remember, you are both on the same team.	Kae sɛ mo baanu nyinaa wɔ kuw koro mu.
I saw a picture.	Mihuu mfonini bi.
My hands are full.	Me nsa ayɛ ma.
I know you do.	Minim sɛ woyɛ.
But they do things.	Nanso wɔyɛ nneɛma.
I have a job now.	Mewɔ adwuma mprempren.
It was the same throughout the night.	Na ɛte saa ara wɔ anadwo mũ no nyinaa mu.
Power flowed back into her, hot and painful.	Tumi san kɔɔ ne mu bio, na ɛyɛ hyew na ɛyɛ yaw.
I'll take you with me.	Mede wo bɛkɔ.
People start talking.	Nkurɔfo fi ase kasa.
I am here now.	Mewɔ ha seesei.
And it had gone bad.	Na na akɔ bɔne mu.
He is real, a real man.	Ɔyɛ obi ankasa, ɔyɛ ɔbarima ankasa.
He loved his wife.	Ná ɔpɛ ne yere.
That had to be something, he told himself.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ biribi.
That’s the case here.	Saa na ɛte wɔ ha.
There is definitely the user.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nea ɔde di dwuma no wɔ hɔ.
The car was very expensive.	Ná kar no bo yɛ den yiye.
Manufacturing, including automobiles.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ, a kar ka ho.
That’s what he had done.	Saa na na wayɛ saa.
There are many different types of organic materials in household products.	Nneɛma ahorow pii a wɔde yɛ nneɛma a nkwa wom wɔ ofie nneɛma mu.
It doesn’t really look like anything else.	Ɛnte sɛ biribi foforo biara ankasa.
The power is already in you.	Tumi no wɔ wo mu dedaw.
He was short of money.	Ná sika ho ayɛ na no.
That’s what really matters.	Ɛno ne nea ɛho hia ankasa.
That’s what he thought.	Saa na na osusuw.
He doesn’t do anything to us.	Ɔnyɛ yɛn hwee.
To be comfortable on the other side of this.	Sɛ yɛn ho bɛtɔ yɛn wɔ eyi fã foforo no.
Maybe even in the house.	Ebia wɔ fie hɔ mpo.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ obiara reyɛ yiye.
Only bad people do that.	Nnipa bɔne nkutoo na wɔyɛ saa.
That might be fine, though.	Nanso, ebia ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
Often, they are very good at doing this on their own without our help.	Mpɛn pii no, wɔn ankasa ho akokwaw yiye wɔ eyi yɛ mu a yɛn mmoa nka ho.
Me too.	Me nso.
I think of him as my father.	Misusuw ne ho sɛ me papa.
Plenty of time to give.	Bere pii a wɔde bɛma.
There was something else.	Na biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
Do what you want!	Yɛ nea wopɛ!
Time seemed so irrelevant.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea bere ho nhia koraa.
You know what school is like.	Wunim sɛnea sukuu te.
It is an important day for them.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛho hia ma wɔn.
Or, in this case, you for me.	Anaasɛ, wɔ eyi mu no, wo ma me.
Not too dramatic.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa dodo.
That is also something you need to be aware of.	Ɛno nso yɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no yiye.
This was a surprise.	Ná eyi yɛ nwonwa.
We can do one this afternoon.	Yebetumi ayɛ biako awia yi.
The road was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ ɔkwan no so ma.
Surely it is your right to do so.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ wo hokwan sɛ woyɛ saa.
That doesn’t work either.	Ɛno nso nyɛ adwuma.
I know a lot about him, but certainly not everything.	Minim ne ho nsɛm pii, nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ biribiara.
In one case.	Wɔ asɛm biako mu no.
And that’s the beauty of it.	Na ɛno ne ade a ɛyɛ fɛ no.
Now everyone has one.	Seesei obiara wɔ bi.
This latter point should come as no surprise.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ saa asɛm a etwa to yi yɛ yɛn nwonwa.
You can do this easily here.	Wubetumi ayɛ eyi a ɛnyɛ den wɔ ha.
They are nice, but not necessary.	Wɔyɛ fɛ, nanso ɛho nhia.
That was a really amazing thing.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
The same will seem to be the case.	Saa ara na ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛte.
They have nothing to do with each other.	Wɔn ne wɔn ho wɔn ho nni hwee yɛ.
There are many applications out there.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a wɔde di dwuma wɔ hɔ.
It’s a name.	Ɛyɛ din bi.
Talk! 	Kasa!
Not every day, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ da biara da, ɔkwan biara so.
You all have to come.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mo nyinaa ba.
That one is only the first one.	Saa biako no yɛ nea edi kan nkutoo.
Good cheap, not bad cheap.	Eye a ne bo yɛ mmerɛw, ɛnyɛ bɔne a ne bo yɛ mmerɛw.
That water is nothing to them.	Saa nsu no nyɛ hwee mma wɔn.
The system also has three time zones.	Nhyehyɛe no nso wɔ bere nhyehyɛe ahorow abiɛsa.
Transfers are real.	Nneɛma a wɔde tu kɔ baabi foforo no yɛ nokware.
Not there and not anywhere else.	Ɛnyɛ hɔ na ɛnyɛ baabi foforo biara.
She sent her children to school.	Ɔde ne mma kɔɔ sukuu.
I had an idea that might work.	Ná mewɔ adwene bi a ebia ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
Without a doubt, in these past two years, he had grown.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔ mfe abien a atwam yi mu no, na wayɛ kɛse.
Time, that’s the problem.	Bere, ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
All the children looked at him.	Mmofra no nyinaa hwɛɛ no.
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I know know what this game is about.	Minim nim nea saa agoru yi fa ho.
He is all of us in this moment.	Ɔyɛ yɛn nyinaa wɔ saa bere yi mu.
To be with them.	Sɛ́ wobɛka wɔn ho.
He showed her one.	Ɔde biako kyerɛɛ no.
How true that is.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛno yɛ nokware.
Just like we used to.	Sɛnea na yɛyɛ kan no.
Now I feel so bad about myself.	Seesei mete nka sɛ me ho yɛ me bɔne paa.
I hope the same is true.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ saa ara na ɛte.
He is in a state of bliss.	Ɔwɔ anigye mu.
You don’t do that.	Wonyɛ saa.
Use existing resources.	Fa nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ dedaw no di dwuma.
I slipped my eyes out.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ so.
And it was very difficult.	Na ɛyɛ den yiye.
How wonderful, isn't it? 	Ɛyɛ nwonwa dɛn, ɛnte saa?
. . . .	.
A good, strong boy.	Abarimaa pa a ne ho yɛ den.
That should present itself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno da ne ho adi.
Take care of everyone.	Hwɛ obiara yiye.
In any case, his words were completely untrue.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na ne nsɛm no nyɛ nokware koraa.
Many things have happened.	Nneɛma pii asi.
Except for a few things.	Gye sɛ nneɛma kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
They are not quite the same size.	Wɔn kɛse nyɛ pɛ koraa.
Except it’s not a lot of water.	Gye sɛ ɛnyɛ nsu pii.
There was no other time, only time.	Na bere foforo biara nni hɔ, bere nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
You are doing two jobs.	Woreyɛ adwuma abien.
That’s the easy part for me.	Ɛno ne ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ma me.
Only he can solve this problem.	Ɔno nkutoo na obetumi adi ɔhaw yi ho dwuma.
You have to work on it a little bit at a time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho adwuma kakra wɔ bere koro mu.
I could have helped.	Ná metumi aboa.
There’s always next year.	Ɛwɔ hɔ bere nyinaa afe a edi hɔ no.
Get out of there and stay outside.	Fi hɔ na tra abɔnten.
We were very much in it.	Ná yɛwɔ mu kɛse.
This is obviously true.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
And maybe this is why it’s so hard.	Na ebia eyi nti na ɛyɛ den saa no.
It’s certainly not for everyone.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ obiara de.
Stay behind here.	Tra ha akyi.
Many have not.	Pii nyɛɛ saa.
I don’t think you should, you know.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa, wunim.
It was very beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
It’s too soon to tell.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo sɛ wobɛka.
That must be difficult.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ den.
But it is also dangerous.	Nanso asiane wom nso.
It just works.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
Check it out inside.	Hwɛ mu wɔ mu.
We are all sinners.	Yɛn nyinaa yɛ bɔne.
Look, you at home are a good person too.	Hwɛ, wo a wowɔ fie no nso yɛ onipa pa.
There was no time to solve a problem.	Ná bere biara nni hɔ a wɔde bedi ɔhaw bi ho dwuma.
It seemed strange.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I felt like a new man.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ ɔbarima foforo.
Obviously many of you.	Ɛda adi sɛ mo mu pii.
They risked their lives.	Wɔde wɔn nkwa too asiane mu.
I couldn’t say it right.	Na mintumi nka no yiye.
It has been a great pleasure to know you.	Ayɛ anigye kɛse sɛ minim wo.
Look at this guy.	Hwɛ saa ɔbarima yi.
We all agree that we should.	Yɛn nyinaa gye tom sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
So we just have to do it.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ara kwa.
There may be several reasons for such an arrangement.	Ebia nneɛma pii nti na wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe a ɛte saa.
He does just fine himself.	Ɔno ankasa yɛ ade yiye ara kwa.
This was herself.	Ná eyi ne ɔno ankasa.
She is very beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
He has as much right here as you do.	Ɔwɔ pii wɔ ha yi ara te sɛ wo.
None of that matters.	Ɛno mu biara ho nhia.
This statement is also true.	Saa asɛm yi nso yɛ nokware.
Nothing to do now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ mprempren.
Any information he provides is not free.	Nsɛm biara a ɔde bɛma wo no, ɛnyɛ nea wɔde ma wo kwa.
And maybe he’ll like that.	Na ebia n’ani begye ho saa.
Half of them were true.	Ná wɔn fã yɛ nokware.
The first two of them are very close to each other.	Wɔn mu abien a edi kan no bɛn wɔn ho wɔn ho yiye.
It was a factual statement.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nokware.
There is no cost to you.	Ɛho ka biara nni hɔ mma wo.
But you’ve done it right.	Nanso woayɛ no yiye.
But those mistakes often come at a cost.	Nanso mpɛn pii no, saa mfomso ahorow no ma ɛho ka.
I want to touch them.	Mepɛ sɛ mede me nsa ka wɔn.
More about him in a bit.	Nsɛm pii fa ne ho wɔ kakra mu.
I wouldn’t be able to say exactly.	Anka mintumi nka nea ɛte ankasa.
This road is usually closed to traffic.	Mpɛn pii no, kar fa kwan yi so ma.
He knew the cost of things.	Ná onim nneɛma ho ka.
This can happen with music, or something else.	Eyi betumi aba wɔ nnwom, anaa biribi foforo ho.
Generally, it’s busy.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛyɛ nea adagyew nnim.
None of them seemed to notice.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔn mu biara anhu.
I had toyed with the idea for a while.	Ná mede adwene no adi agoru kakra.
A squirrel has that.	Ɔkraman wɔ saa.
A fresh perspective.	Adwene a ɛyɛ foforo.
You can play with their situation.	Wubetumi de wɔn tebea no adi agoru.
Maybe he would get better.	Ebia na ne ho bɛtɔ no.
I don’t want to do this anymore.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi bio.
But someone has to do that.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ saa.
Was he doing it.	So na ɔreyɛ no.
It’s so amazing to me.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa saa.
I believe it.	Migye di.
No children for me.	Mma biara nni hɔ mma me.
It’s cold.	Ɛyɛ awɔw.
There is still much to be done.	Nneɛma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Much better idea.	Adwene a eye sen saa kɛse.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani agye ho kɛse.
This is not about me and not least about my wife.	Eyi nyɛ me ho asɛm na ɛnyɛ me yere ho asɛm kakraa bi.
She only ever tries to help and be nice.	Ɔbɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛboa na wayɛ fɛ nkutoo pɛn.
Most of our children should go to prison.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn mma dodow no ara kɔ afiase.
They seem wrong to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ mfomso ma me.
But maybe he doesn’t.	Nanso ebia ɔnyɛ saa.
I’m not sure.	M’ani nnye ho.
But this opportunity is far from absolute.	Nanso saa hokwan yi nyɛ nea edi mũ koraa.
If you were there, you would.	Sɛ wowɔ hɔ a, anka wobɛyɛ saa.
Each of the days he has done it.	Nna a wayɛ no mu biara.
Nothing feels bad then .	Biribiara nte nka sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne saa bere no .
But no one is here.	Nanso obiara nni ha.
Which was true in a way.	Nea na ɛyɛ nokware wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
They filled a room.	Wɔde dan bi hyɛɛ mu ma.
There is no mention of the moon.	Ɔsram no ho asɛm biara nni hɔ.
Is this even human ?.	So eyi mpo yɛ onipa ?.
This is simply not the case for many people.	Eyi nte saa wɔ nnipa pii fam kɛkɛ.
Please can someone help.	Mesrɛ sɛ obi betumi aboa.
Not that it’s part of me.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ me fã.
You can create as many copies as you want.	Wubetumi ayɛ mfonini dodow biara a wopɛ.
They argued for hours.	Wɔde nnɔnhwerew pii gyee akyinnye.
It seems really hard.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den ankasa.
On paper, the plan is relatively simple.	Wɔ krataa so no, nhyehyɛe no yɛ mmerɛw kakra.
I hoped it was.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
Children loved the animals.	Ná mmofra ani gye mmoa no ho.
It’s hot today.	Ɛyɛ hyew nnɛ.
His plans for the summer, however, were fairly simple.	Nanso, na nhyehyɛe a wayɛ ama awɔw bere no yɛ mmerɛw koraa.
But that was if it was great.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse a.
Be careful now, it’s hot.	Hwɛ yiye mprempren, ɛyɛ hyew.
The plan was there.	Ná nhyehyɛe no wɔ hɔ.
If he could do it.	Sɛ na obetumi ayɛ.
Don’t tell me.	Nka nkyerɛ me.
Just an idea.	Adwene bi nkutoo.
In any way.	Ɔkwan biara so.
There may still be hope.	Ebia na anidaso da so ara wɔ hɔ.
That’s all you need to know.	Ɛno ara ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
And only when things are happening.	Na bere a nneɛma bi rekɔ so nkutoo.
I don't have a picture of him.	Minni ne mfonini biara.
Thanks again for everything.	Meda mo ase bio wɔ biribiara ho.
She is a bit slender and cute.	Ɔyɛ mmerɛw kakra na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
This surprised them.	Eyi maa wɔn ho dwiriw wɔn.
I want something to look after.	Mepɛ biribi a mehwɛ so.
But who could tell.	Nanso hena na na obetumi ahu.
But there are older ones.	Nanso wɔn a wɔn mfe akɔ anim wɔ hɔ.
It used to be that way.	Kan no na ɛte saa.
I don't know how this will work out.	Minnim sɛnea eyi bɛyɛ yiye.
I was hoping this would say it for me.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ eyi bɛka ama me.
It was really pretty.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
I really enjoyed it.	M’ani gyee ho ankasa.
I just didn’t want to do my homework.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ me fie nnwuma kɛkɛ.
But at least it works in a way.	Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
A handsome man.	Ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He knew about it.	Ná onim ho asɛm.
Prices were similar to those in town.	Ná nneɛma bo te sɛ nea ɛwɔ kurow no mu no.
It’s his name.	Ɛyɛ ne din.
It was just fun, just really fun.	Na ɛyɛ anigye ara kwa, anigye ankasa ara kwa.
It seemed easy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
It was so simple and beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
So is your book.	Saa ara na wo nhoma no nso te.
He is the subject.	Ɔno ne asɛm a wɔka ho asɛm.
He was once old friends.	Na bere bi ne nnamfo dedaw.
You don't know? 	Wunnim?
Anything could happen at any time.	Ná biribiara betumi asi bere biara.
he says that.	ɔka sɛ.
If you used a gun, you can tell me about that.	Sɛ wode tuo dii dwuma a, wubetumi aka saa asɛm no akyerɛ me.
I don’t think he even likes her.	Minsusuw sɛ n’ani gye ne ho mpo.
Or if so, no one told me.	Anaasɛ sɛ ɛte saa a, obiara anka ankyerɛ me.
I can’t get out of it.	Mintumi mfi mu.
That just seemed wrong.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ mfomso ara kwa.
I want to go to everyone.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ obiara nkyɛn.
There is no time to do anything about it.	Bere biara nni hɔ a wode bɛyɛ ho hwee.
That’s the interesting thing.	Ɛno ne ade a ɛyɛ anigye.
In no time, you will.	Wɔ bere tiaa bi mu no, wobɛyɛ saa.
It doesn’t cost anything.	Ɛho nnye hwee.
But as a child, she was a very pretty girl.	Nanso bere a na ɔyɛ abofra no, na ɔyɛ abeawa a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
That doesn’t matter now.	Ɛno mfa ho mprempren.
Take care of yourself completely.	Hwɛ wo ho yiye koraa.
Except that it doesn’t.	Gye sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
However, you can see that it didn’t.	Nanso, wubetumi ahu sɛ anyɛ saa.
He didn’t want you to know.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ wuhu.
I have household chores.	Mewɔ ofie nnwuma.
It was a really great game.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru kɛse ankasa.
I cannot overstate how wonderful this story is.	Mintumi nka sɛnea asɛm yi yɛ nwonwa no ho asɛm pii.
That may not be true at all.	Ebia ɛno nyɛ nokware koraa.
So maybe that’s what happened.	Enti ebia ɛno ne nea esii.
That would have been a different story.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ asɛm foforo.
He hurried home.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm kɔɔ fie.
The music is great.	Nnwom no yɛ kɛse.
Sing, sing, sing!	To dwom, to dwom, to dwom!
And for how long.	Na bere tenten ahe.
He was just excited.	Ná n’ani agye kɛkɛ.
Many people did that.	Nnipa pii yɛɛ saa.
Look at the letter next to him.	Hwɛ krataa a ɛwɔ ne nkyɛn no.
There was someone at the door.	Ná obi wɔ ɔpon no ano.
To make people happy.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a nkurɔfo ani begye.
He had plans.	Ná ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow.
We are a group of friends.	Yɛyɛ nnamfo kuw.
And they’ve touched you.	Na wɔde wɔn nsa aka wo.
Only this time it wasn’t.	Saa bere yi nkutoo na na ɛnte saa.

Offer that in him.	Fa saa asɛm no ma wɔ ne mu.
I still wanted to know more about the boy.	Ná meda so ara pɛ sɛ mihu abarimaa no ho nsɛm pii.
You are doing a good job with them.	Wo ne wɔn reyɛ adwuma pa.
But it has to be that way.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
It felt like it had to be there.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
They were happy.	Ná wɔn ani gye.
Stay where you are.	Tra baabi a wowɔ no.
He didn't seem to be.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔnyɛ obi a ɔte saa.
Most everyone had.	Ná obiara dodow no ara wɔ.
Don't tell anyone else, okay?	Nka nkyerɛ obi foforo biara, ɛyɛ?
That’s your way.	Ɛno ne wo kwan.
You are a lucky man.	Woyɛ ɔbarima a wowɔ anigye.
Inside, there is the reason.	Wɔ mu no, nea enti a ɛte saa no wɔ hɔ.
It’s very interesting indeed.	Ɛyɛ anigye yiye ampa.
But this is not easy at all.	Nanso eyi nyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
I feel so amazing.	Mete nka sɛ me ho yɛ nwonwa yiye.
You have to get involved.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu.
There was no idea.	Ná adwene biara nni hɔ.
I know what you’re doing.	Minim nea woreyɛ.
In order to	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a .
Or he doesn’t.	Anaasɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
All the characteristics.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa.
You have to accept that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye saa asɛm no tom.
It is not difficult.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
You were brought here.	Wɔde wo baa ha.
Maybe that’s all of this.	Ebia ɛno ne eyi nyinaa.
The man thought the situation through.	Ɔbarima no susuw tebea no ho yiye.
Again, more on that later, sorry.	Bio nso, ɛno ho nsɛm pii akyiri yi, kyɛw.
I don’t know this guy.	Minnim saa ɔbarima yi.
He did the idea for me.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ adwene no maa me.
There may be more.	Ebia pii wɔ hɔ.
Have fun with them.	Wo ne wɔn nnya anigye.
You spend a lot of your time thinking about it.	Wode wo bere pii susuw ho.
Often not for the best.	Mpɛn pii no ɛnyɛ nea eye sen biara nti.
What it is.	Nea ɛyɛ.
Probably nothing should be done at this time.	Ebia ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribiara saa bere yi.
There was something else going on here.	Na biribi foforo nso rekɔ so wɔ ha.
I had good news.	Ná mewɔ nsɛm pa.
It was in that era.	Ná ɛwɔ saa bere no mu.
You have to do the same thing over and over again.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ade koro no ara mpɛn pii.
That’s a good girl.	Ɛno yɛ abeawa pa.
Make the most of the time we have.	Fa bere a yɛwɔ no di dwuma yiye.
He should talk about someone falsifying his name.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka obi a ɔreyɛ ne din ho atoro ho asɛm.
I will tell you something though.	Meka biribi kyerɛ wo nanso.
I've been in it for a long time.	Mewɔ mu akyɛ.
Do you do this yourself ? 	Wo ankasa na woyɛ eyi ?
doubt.	nnye nni.
Take it that way.	Fa ka no saa.
The matter bothered him.	Asɛm no haw no.
The pain in the leg could be anything, it might be nothing.	Nan no mu a ɛyɛ yaw no betumi ayɛ biribiara, ebia na ɛnyɛ hwee.
It’s very difficult for me to do.	Ɛyɛ den yiye ma me sɛ mɛyɛ.
I have nothing to offer.	Minni biribiara a mede bɛma.
That makes it really easy to use.	Ɛno ma ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
I thought this method would work.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔkwan yi bɛyɛ adwuma.
There are pictures of him.	Ne mfonini ahorow wɔ hɔ.
And just water.	Na nsu kɛkɛ.
This is going to be a very difficult year.	Eyi bɛyɛ afe a ɛyɛ den yiye.
And it wasn’t either.	Na ɛnyɛ saa nso.
Maybe it was a little too late.	Ebia na atwam kakra.
It certainly wasn’t new.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛnyɛ foforo.
I could do this.	Ná metumi ayɛ eyi.
I think everyone is just beautiful.	Misusuw sɛ obiara ho yɛ fɛ ara kwa.
I say good morning every day.	Meka no anɔpa pa da biara.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia.
That is not good at all.	Ɛno nyɛ papa koraa.
They are very beautiful.	Wɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
This will be very difficult.	Eyi bɛyɛ den yiye.
It’s a good day to bring in the money.	Ɛyɛ da a wɔde sika no bɛba yiye.
It was a little weird.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra.
It’s going to go further.	Ɛrekɔ akyiri.
You know what is what.	Wunim nea ɛyɛ nea.
But you are too big and strong for them too.	Nanso woyɛ kɛse dodo na wo ho yɛ den ma wɔn nso.
No one ever really knows.	Obiara nnim ankasa da.
Food doesn’t cost much.	Aduan nnye sika pii.
I go to a few and it’s easy.	Mekɔ kakraa bi nkyɛn na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
There is no time for that.	Bere nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ saa.
It’s not too much of a problem for me, though.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ me haw dodo.
Many people don’t.	Nnipa pii nyɛ saa.
Maybe he had one, too.	Ebia na ɔno nso wɔ bi.
Say something good or say something bad.	Ka biribi pa anaa ka biribi bɔne.
It’s just old fashioned.	Ɛyɛ dedaw ara kwa.
In any case.	Wɔ tebea biara mu.
He enjoyed his short stay.	N’ani gyee bere tiaa a ɔde traa hɔ no ho.
Move his stuff out.	Tu ne nneɛma fi mu.
The clothes were too tight.	Ná ntade no ayɛ den dodo.
Same, for convenience.	Saa ara, sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I had a good game.	Ná mewɔ agoru pa bi.
I love you too.	Me nso mepɛ wo.
In the end, everyone was there.	Awiei no, na obiara wɔ hɔ.
No problems so far.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ de besi nnɛ.
He’s been very popular in the last few years.	N’ani agye ne ho kɛse wɔ mfe kakraa a atwam no mu.
He needs to make one last try.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden biako a etwa to.
You know there is no other way.	Wunim sɛ ɔkwan foforo biara nni hɔ.
I trusted it for you.	Mede me ho too so maa wo.
This is from the kids.	Eyi fi mmofra no hɔ.
I put aside everything you said.	Mede biribiara a wokae no to nkyɛn.
That seems to have worked.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ayɛ adwuma.
It would have been pretty cool, though.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ fɛ yiye, nanso.
That is our great food.	Ɛno ne yɛn aduan kɛse.
Remember to bring your dog dinner.	Kae sɛ wode wo kraman anwummere aduan bɛba.
He doesn’t want you.	Ɔmpɛ wo.
You may use a simple method to do this well.	Ebia wode ɔkwan a ɛnyɛ den bedi dwuma de ayɛ eyi yiye.
However, the picture is not really a story.	Nanso, mfonini no nyɛ asɛm bi ankasa.
But there is more to be done.	Nanso pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Check out the scene.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛte.
Or their shoes.	Anaasɛ wɔn mpaboa.
He was such a guy.	Ná ɔte saa.
No help from that side then.	Mmoa biara mfi saa fã no hɔ saa bere no.
And they’re cheaper too.	Na wɔn nso bo yɛ mmerɛw.
This is the time to put yourself first.	Eyi ne bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho di kan.
It’s going to be.	Ɛyɛ kɔ.
There is no fear in me!.	Suro biara nni me ho!.
There are many things.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ.
The same is true for you.	Saa ara na ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ.
Time is all you have.	Bere no ara ne nea wowɔ.
It’s never been that way.	Ɛnyɛ saa da.
This recipe is really easy!	Saa aduan yi yɛ mmerɛw ankasa!
I always admired him for that.	Ná m’ani gye ne ho bere nyinaa wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
It had a wonderful view of the city.	Ná ɛwɔ kurow no ho mfonini a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
All the things that were put down.	Nneɛma a wɔde too fam nyinaa.
Very nice details about each of them.	Nsɛm a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye wɔ wɔn mu biara ho.
Remember it, too.	Kae no nso.
What a joy that is.	Hwɛ anigye ara a ɛno yɛ.
He loves arguing with people.	N’ani gye ho sɛ ɔne nkurɔfo begye akyinnye.
This can be exciting.	Eyi betumi ayɛ anigye.
Tom believed him.	Tom gyee no dii.
But nothing seems to work.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea biribiara ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
Tell me where I should look.	Ka baabi a ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ.
Or so the story went.	Anaasɛ saa na asɛm no kɔɔ so.
But this is not a real book.	Nanso eyi nyɛ nhoma ankasa.
I can almost guarantee it will work.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ metumi ahyɛ bɔ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
They are beautiful people.	Wɔyɛ nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
This need not be a bad plan.	Ɛho nhia sɛ eyi yɛ nhyehyɛe bɔne.
It is not so certain.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware saa.
Someone please give me a hand.	Obi mesrɛ wo ma me nsa.
Everything that was there.	Biribiara a na ɛwɔ hɔ.
You can’t do it that way.	Worentumi nyɛ no saa kwan no so.
There is no one like that.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔte saa.
If its good music, its good music.	Sɛ ne nnwom pa a, ne nnwom pa.
All utilities are included.	Nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma nyinaa ka ho.
This is a fairly common situation.	Eyi yɛ tebea a abu so koraa.
He's so cheap.	Ɔno ne bo yɛ mmerɛw saa.
It’s not about the dog at all, really.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkraman no ho asɛm koraa, ampa.
You know what we do.	Wunim nea yɛyɛ.
Somehow, though, that wasn’t the point.	Nanso, ɔkwan bi so no, na ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
I hope my comment doesn't hurt you.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ me asɛm a meka sɛ ɛnyɛ yaw wo.
The atmosphere of the meeting was pleasant.	Ná nhyiam no mu tebea no yɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
This is where it all went wrong again.	Eyi ne baabi a ne nyinaa kɔɔ bɔne bio.
Thank people a lot and often.	Da nkurɔfo ase pii na mpɛn pii.
This was a huge amount of money.	Ná eyi yɛ sika kɛse bi.
And somehow there is again.	Na ɔkwan bi so no ɛwɔ hɔ bio.
Not much you can see.	Ɛnyɛ pii a wubetumi ahu.
The dress didn’t work, and it doesn’t work at all.	Atade no anyɛ adwuma, na ɛnyɛ adwuma koraa.
Can anyone help me?.	Obi betumi aboa me?.
No wonder he was so willing.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ na ɔwɔ ɔpɛ saa.
It’s something we have to do.	Ɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
I need to know what is going on here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha.
I was that guy.	Ná meyɛ saa ɔbarima no.
You have my full and complete support.	Wowɔ me mmoa a edi mũ na edi mũ.
I was the only human house.	Ná me nkutoo ne onipa fie.
Start with something you know.	Fa biribi a wunim no fi ase.
I wanted to.	Ná mepɛ.
He can get some.	Obetumi anya bi.
At least not the cheap kind.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den no.
There seemed little chance of success.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea hokwan kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ sɛ obetumi adi nkonim.
But beyond that, no problem.	Nanso ɛno akyi no, ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
Power is too cheap.	Tumi yɛ nea ne bo yɛ mmerɛw dodo.
He had a job to do and he did it.	Ná ɔwɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ na ɔyɛɛ saa.
The drought here has worsened this year.	Ɔpɛ a asi wɔ ha no mu ayɛ den kɛse afe yi.
He doesn't do that	Ɔnyɛ saa .
You must come back with us.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne yɛn san ba.
I think there is something wrong with his head.	Misusuw sɛ biribi bɔne bi wɔ ne ti so.
Only bad things.	Nneɛma bɔne nkutoo.
He was interested in the books, only the books.	Ná n’ani wɔ nhoma ahorow no ho, nhoma ahorow no nkutoo.
I don’t know what to do next.	Minnim nea mɛyɛ akyi.
Not so much about it.	Ɛnyɛ pii saa fa.
In my opinion, it should not be used.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no, ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma.
That’s pretty much all you know.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ne nea wunim.
He runs with beautiful things.	Ɔde nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ tu mmirika.
If you and your homework.	Sɛ wo ne wo fie adwuma.
The consensus does not lie.	Adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ no nni atoro.
Show and tell.	Kyerɛ na ka kyerɛ.
Another tomorrow, too.	Ɔkyena foforo nso.
The big day is just a week away.	Da kɛse no aka dapɛn biako pɛ.
I couldn't help him.	Na mintumi mmoa no.
But it would be bad.	Nanso na ɛbɛyɛ bɔne.
We also have a bit more information.	Yɛn nso yɛwɔ nsɛm pii kakra.
So you have two problems.	Enti wowɔ ɔhaw abien.
One he knows.	Biako a onim.
My father or me.	Me papa anaa me.
If you have a problem, we have a problem.	Sɛ wowɔ ɔhaw bi a, yɛwɔ ɔhaw bi.
Make sure they are happy.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wɔn ani agye.
Child, do you really think it will be that easy.	Abofra, so wususuw ankasa sɛ ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
My children.	Me mma.
Not any of them.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn mu biara.
There was often a danger.	Ná asiane bi taa wɔ hɔ.
Who knows what else?.	Hena na onim nea ɛwɔ hɔ bio?.
All real help is needed.	Mmoa ankasa nyinaa ho hia.
The problem is also serious.	Ɔhaw no nso yɛ kɛse.
Whether this is the case.	Sɛ ebia eyi ne asɛm no.
While these products are popular, they are very expensive.	Bere a saa nneɛma yi agye din no, ne bo yɛ den yiye.
Often, it’s not just one simple thing.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ ade biako pɛ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I don’t know what they were.	Minnim nea na wɔyɛ.
Everyone would be happy.	Anka obiara ani begye.
I couldn’t take it anymore.	Na mintumi nnye bio.
They love this dish.	Wɔn ani gye saa aduan yi ho.
No one wants the other guy anyway.	Obiara mpɛ ɔbarima foforo no ɔkwan biara so.
But my hands knew what to do.	Nanso na me nsa nim nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
It is very easy to work this out internally.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ eyi ho adwuma wɔ mu.
Provide as much information as possible.	Fa nsɛm pii ma sɛnea wubetumi.
But if it is true.	Nanso sɛ ɛyɛ nokware a.
If anything, it will be more difficult.	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, ɛbɛyɛ den kɛse.
I think it’s a mistake.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
However, it is much more than that.	Nanso, ɛyɛ pii sen saa.
He has something he likes.	Ɔwɔ biribi a n’ani gye ho.
He would have loved this.	Anka n’ani begye eyi ho.
It’s the simplest and best.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw na eye sen biara.
Just get me out of here.	Yi me fi ha kɛkɛ.
But it was an accident.	Nanso na ɛyɛ akwanhyia.
So that’s the next part of the game.	Enti ɛno ne agoru no fã a edi hɔ.
And it wasn’t.	Na ɛnyɛ saa.
The money and resources are simply not there.	Sika ne nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no nni hɔ ara kwa.
It’s how we are perceived by the number of new users.	Ɛyɛ sɛnea nnipa foforo dodow a wɔde di dwuma no hu yɛn.
Everyone just knows that.	Obiara nim saa ara kɛkɛ.
Or, you know.	Anaasɛ, wunim.
He has nothing to feed him.	Onni biribiara a ɔde bɛma no aduan.
Just trust us.	Fa wo ho to yɛn so kɛkɛ.
Don’t touch it!	Mfa wo nsa nka!
There are a number of issues at stake.	Nsɛm dodow bi na ɛwɔ asɛm no mu.
He gives something away.	Ɔde biribi ma.
Thank you, children.	Meda mo ase mma.
The man was afraid, but not me.	Ná ɔbarima no suro, nanso na ɛnyɛ me.
It doesn’t really exist.	Ɛnyɛ hɔ ankasa.
That project ended years ago.	Saa adwuma no baa awiei mfe bi a atwam ni.
You can take your time.	Wubetumi agye wo bere.
Never tell this to the other team.	Nka eyi nkyerɛ kuw foforo no da.
There was no reason for him to be.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte saa.
There is simply nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa ara kwa.
Ideal for dinner parties.	Ɛyɛ papa ma anwummere apontow ahorow.
Just a word of caution.	Asɛm bi kɛkɛ.
All right.	Ne nyinaa yɛ.
People were fascinated by them.	Nkurɔfo ani gyee wɔn ho.
You just can’t lie to him.	Worentumi nni atoro nkyerɛ no kɛkɛ.
How is this possible?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na eyi betumi aba?
And it wasn’t just about him.	Na ɛnyɛ ne nkutoo ho asɛm.
Time for a new one.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ foforo.
We did most of our work at night.	Ná yɛyɛ yɛn adwuma no fã kɛse no ara anadwo.
We have a life.	Yɛwɔ nkwa.
People consumed far more than they produce.	Nkurɔfo dii nneɛma pii sen nea wɔyɛ no koraa.
He doesn't know about it, yet.	Onnim ho asɛm, de besi nnɛ.
However, there is limited information available for this purpose.	Nanso, nsɛm kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ eyi.
This in itself should not surprise anyone.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi ankasa yɛ obi nwonwa.
Here’s what you need to know.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu ni.
But it is human work.	Nanso ɛyɛ nnipa adwuma.
It seems pretty simple.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Keep everyone busy.	Ma obiara nnya adagyew.
There was something or someone in it.	Na biribi anaa obi wɔ mu.
It’s not just mine.	Ɛnyɛ me de nkutoo.
He knew he wasn't.	Ná onim sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
He looked at her with interest.	Ɔde anigye hwɛɛ no.
I don’t know how many times.	Minnim mpɛn dodow ahe.
Maybe I should make one one day.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biako da koro.
They have been taken away.	Wɔde akɔ.
All right.	Ne nyinaa yɛ.
Everyone was down.	Ná obiara aba fam.
Think about it carefully.	Susuw ho yiye.
Alright.	Ɛyɛ.
This is also true here.	Eyi nso te saa wɔ ha.
He had caused this.	Ná ɔno na ɔde eyi aba.
That wasn’t necessary.	Ná ɛno ho nhia.
They seemed so immersed in the book.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔde wɔn ho ahyɛ nhoma no mu kɛse.
He reached for her.	Ɔde ne nsa kɔɔ ne nkyɛn.
You will become one of them.	Wobɛyɛ wɔn mu biako.
Quite obviously not the same.	Ɛda adi koraa sɛ ɛnyɛ ade koro.
It was truly a wonderful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa ampa.
He wasn’t a human being.	Ná ɔnyɛ onipa.
There is no more work.	Adwuma biara nni hɔ bio.
The years had gone by years, one into the next.	Ná mfe no akɔ so ayɛ mfe, biako akɔ foforo mu.
Music was playing inside.	Ná nnwom rebɔ wɔ mu.
His plan didn’t work out.	Ne nhyehyɛe no amma mu.
A car accident on the road.	Kar akwanhyia bi a esii wɔ ɔkwan so.
That sounds interesting.	Ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
Just a little bit.	Kakraa bi kɛkɛ.
All the kids had new cars.	Ná mmofra no nyinaa wɔ kar foforo.
It was not part of the plan.	Ná ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe no fã.
So when you do something, do it the best.	Enti sɛ woyɛ biribi a, yɛ nea eye sen biara.
What are your favorite songs?	Nnwom bɛn na w’ani gye ho paa?
I don’t know how they do it.	Minnim sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
As in two cases.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ abien mu no.
You can’t have them.	Worentumi nnya wɔn.
No one hears about me.	Obiara nte me ho asɛm.
Everyone is terrible.	Obiara ho yɛ hu.
Children don’t know anything.	Mmofra nnim biribiara.
He’s not a bad boy to talk to.	Ɔnyɛ abarimaa bɔne a ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no kasa.
There was no need to do so.	Na ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
See if we can take another trip.	Hwɛ sɛ yebetumi atu kwan foforo anaa.
More time than we have.	Bere pii sen nea yɛwɔ.
He knew he had to forget her.	Ná onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ne werɛ fi no.
In most cases.	Mpɛn pii no.
This is our focus from now on.	Eyi ne yɛn adwene a yɛde besi so fi mprempren rekɔ.
Maybe it’s really great.	Ebia ɛyɛ kɛse ankasa.
We do the song and everybody loves it.	Yɛyɛ dwom no na obiara ani gye ho.
He was doing that.	Ná ɔyɛ saa.
I don’t know what you’re going to do.	Minnim nea wobɛyɛ.
They all knew the power they wielded.	Ná wɔn nyinaa nim tumi a wɔde di dwuma no.
And it seemed difficult.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
And it’s you.	Na ɛyɛ wo.
We disagree with him.	Yɛn ne no nyɛ adwene.
It feels too real. 	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware dodo. 
It seems to me that both are important.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ me sɛ abien no nyinaa ho hia.
it’s really easy.	ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
And every year there was more to do.	Na afe biara na pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
So, you have to put your feet and hands into it.	Enti, ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo nan ne wo nsa hyɛ mu.
Don’t be so hard on yourself!	Mma wo ho nyɛ den saa!
I can't help crying.	Mintumi mmoa me su.
It’s one that no one ever really made me want.	Ɛyɛ nea obiara amma mempɛ no ankasa da.
He was a musician.	Ná ɔyɛ nnwom.
Maybe not like mine, maybe not like yours.	Ebia ɛnyɛ sɛ me de no, ebia ɛnyɛ sɛ wo de no.
It was a perfect situation.	Ná ɛyɛ tebea a edi mũ.
But it didn’t matter.	Nanso anyɛ hwee.
In a moment they are a city.	Bere tiaa bi mu no wɔyɛ kurow.
However, the results are not good.	Nanso, nea afi mu aba no nyɛ papa.
It’s not an accident after all.	Ɛnyɛ akwanhyia wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
They were strong, fragile.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ den, na wɔyɛ mmerɛw.
His name was.	Ná ne din de.
That would be such fun.	Ɛno bɛyɛ anigye a ɛte saa.
Some days are good.	Nna bi yɛ papa.
He didn't want to play with me.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔne me di agoru.
Here is one right here.	Biako ni wɔ ha yi ara.
Our time is long past.	Yɛn bere no atwam akyɛ.
She was becoming a mother.	Ná ɔreyɛ maame.
The result is this book.	Nea afi mu aba ne nhoma yi.
You can steal something.	Wubetumi awia ade.
And it wasn’t our idea.	Na ɛnyɛ yɛn adwene.
He worked the night shift.	Ná ɔyɛ adwuma anadwo adwuma no.
If only there was a bigger story in play.	Sɛ na asɛm kɛse bi wɔ agoru no mu a.
But it doesn’t have to be.	Nanso enhia sɛ ɛte saa.
The boy was hit by a car.	Kar bi bɔɔ abarimaa no.
Everything else, he’s growing.	Biribiara a aka no, ɔreyɛ kɛse.
He would take her with him and that was the last.	Na ɔde no bɛka ne ho na ɛno ne nea etwa to.
The remainder was used in experiments.	Wɔde nea aka no dii dwuma wɔ sɔhwɛ ahorow mu.
A simple mistake.	Mfomso a ɛnyɛ den.
He told me where to go.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me baabi a ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
As if he knew something.	Te sɛ nea na onim biribi.
What matters is that you do it.	Nea ɛho hia ne sɛ wobɛyɛ.
This does not mean that he is mentally ill.	Eyi nkyerɛ sɛ n’adwene nyɛ papa.
The movie ends.	Sini no ba awiei.
Many people felt very happy.	Nnipa pii tee anigye kɛse nka.
I have included the first two below.	Mede abien a edi kan no aka ho wɔ ase ha.
There was nothing you could do.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
You have to think fast.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw nneɛma ho ntɛmntɛm.
It is important that we all volunteer.	Ɛho hia sɛ yɛn nyinaa tu yɛn ho ma.
The letter itself was unremarkable.	Ná krataa no ankasa nyɛ nwonwa.
It’s a hot day.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ hyew.
More like someone you know.	Te sɛ obi a wunim no kɛse.
You can get people to give you more money.	Wubetumi ama nkurɔfo ama wo sika pii.
This is not new information.	Eyi nyɛ nsɛm foforo.
That would be a mistake too.	Ɛno nso bɛyɛ mfomso.
On the way to dinner.	Wɔ kwan so rekɔ anwummere aduan.
At least not that group.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ saa kuw no.
And it was too late.	Na na aka akyi dodo.
Like this guy.	Te sɛ saa ɔbarima yi.
This information is available in many publications.	Saa nsɛm yi wɔ nhoma ahorow pii mu.
But this is over now.	Nanso eyi aba awiei mprempren.
But what you just said is interesting.	Nanso nea wokae seesei ara no ani gye ho.
Look look here.	Hwɛ hwɛ ha.
Maybe I can do that.	Ebia metumi ayɛ saa.
He is the man for her.	Ɔno ne ɔbarima no ma no.
The food is usually eaten with your hands.	Mpɛn pii no, wɔde wo nsa na edi aduan no.
The whole house fell on us.	Ofie no nyinaa hwee yɛn so.
I feel the same way.	Mete nka saa ara.
It may be a lot of things you find yourself using.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nneɛma pii a wuhu sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
The test was severe.	Ná sɔhwɛ no mu yɛ den.
However, there are some problems.	Nanso, ɔhaw ahorow bi wɔ hɔ.
Who knows how many people.	Hena na onim nnipa dodow ahe.
I was taken to a room.	Wɔde me kɔɔ dan bi mu.
They are late for school.	Wɔka akyi wɔ sukuu mu.
I know he's in there somewhere.	Minim sɛ ɔwɔ mu wɔ baabi.
I don’t have a headache.	Minni ti a ɛyɛ me yaw.
In this case, I am in my room.	Wɔ eyi mu no, mewɔ me dan mu.
She was beautiful and charming.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ na na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Could he have done that? 	So na obetumi ayɛ saa?
But the same pretty face.	Nanso anim a ɛyɛ fɛ koro no ara.
I didn’t like that.	Ná m’ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
But it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛho nhia.
Without their help, we wouldn’t have been able to go.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ wɔn mmoa a, anka yɛrentumi nkɔ.
Again,.	Bio,.
I sign and thank him.	Mede me nsa hyɛ ase na meda no ase.
And that’s the point.	Na ɛno ne asɛm no.
You can’t get into them too easily.	Worentumi nnya wɔn mu mmerɛw dodo.
I don’t think you know me.	Minsusuw sɛ wunim me.
That did almost nothing for me.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno anyɛ hwee amma me.
Winter is only a few days away.	Nna kakraa bi pɛ na aka ansa na awɔw bere no adu.
If he does, he does.	Sɛ ɔyɛ saa a.
But he didn’t have to.	Nanso na enhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
It’s a great one.	Ɛyɛ kɛse.
You're right about that.	Woayɛ no yiye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
He knew what to say next.	Ná onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka akyi.
This will be a very exciting year.	Eyi bɛyɛ afe a ɛyɛ anigye yiye paa.
That makes you one of them.	Ɛno ma woyɛ wɔn mu biako.
This is the important point.	Eyi ne asɛm a ɛho hia no.
I'm aiming for you, as well.	Mede m’ani asi wo so, saa ara.
That was a mistake.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfomso.
That’s my fault.	Ɛno ne me bɔne.
The school has no windows.	Sukuu no nni mfɛnsere biara.
The day has come.	Ɛda no adu.
First, none of the defendants understand this meeting.	Nea edi kan no, wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho too wɔn so no mu biara nte saa nhyiam yi ase.
The boy was lying in bed with a fever.	Ná abarimaa no da mpa so a ne ho ayɛ no hyew.
You are one of them.	Woyɛ wɔn mu biako.
I don’t know about that.	Minnim saa asɛm no.
We can’t spend too much time on such trivial things.	Yɛrentumi mfa bere pii nyɛ nneɛma a ɛho nhia saa.
I don’t know about that walk home.	Minnim saa nantew a mekɔ fie no ho hwee.
He and the child did not understand.	Ná ɔne abofra no nte ase.
But not anymore, man.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bio, onipa.
His father didn't seem to like why.	Ɛte sɛ nea na ne papa ani nnye nea enti a ɔte saa no ho.
One last shot at me.	Tuo biako a etwa to a wɔde too me so.
His mother led them back to their room with a nod.	Ne maame dii wɔn anim san kɔɔ wɔn dan mu a ɔde ne ti too fam.
He gives it to those who do.	Ɔde ma wɔn a wɔyɛ saa no.
And yet it never is.	Na nanso ɛnyɛ saa da.
I get my best stuff that way.	Me nsa ka me nneɛma a eye sen biara saa kwan no so.
She barely liked him.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na n’ani nnye ne ho.
He was just doing that.	Ná ɔyɛ saa ara kwa.
It is very difficult for all of us.	Ɛyɛ den ma yɛn nyinaa yiye.
It’s a long shot.	Ɛyɛ tuo tenten.
So here is what you tell them.	Enti nea woka kyerɛ wɔn ni.
That looks pretty good.	Ɛno hwɛ sɛ eye yiye.
I definitely agree with the first two.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ me ne abien a edi kan no yɛ adwene.
This is a big, complex system.	Eyi yɛ nhyehyɛe kɛse bi a ɛyɛ den.
There are just so many of them.	Wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ ara kwa.
Not just the sex thing.	Ɛnyɛ nna ho ade no nkutoo.
It’s smart.	Ɛyɛ nyansa.
Or give it to someone else.	Anaasɛ fa ma obi foforo.
Not that much of a surprise.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa kɛse saa.
They are real people.	Wɔyɛ nnipa ankasa.
He has finally done it.	Awiei koraa no, wayɛ no.
This was certainly not true.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na eyi nyɛ nokware.
It’s still hot.	Ɛda so ara hyew.
I am a big girl.	Meyɛ abeawa kɛse.
You are in trouble.	Wowɔ ɔhaw mu.
I lean towards the former.	Mede me ho to kan no so.
It’s a great one.	Ɛyɛ kɛse.
He played with me.	Ɔne me dii agoru.
I know you had to do it.	Minim sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
But it’s a long time.	Nanso ɛyɛ bere tenten.
At least it’s hard for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ den ma me.
So glad we are friends.	Enti anigye sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo.
You can’t get there before winter.	Worentumi nkɔ hɔ ansa na awɔw bere adu.
There are many good things that way.	Nneɛma pa pii wɔ hɔ saa kwan no so.
I thought we were best friends.	Misusuwii sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo paa.
We enjoyed good food.	Yɛn ani gyee aduan pa ho.
I know how much it hurts.	Minim sɛnea ɛyɛ yaw kɛse.
Keep following these people.	Kɔ so di saa nkurɔfo yi akyi.
There is no one.	Obiara nni hɔ.
Get out in front.	Fi adi wɔ anim.
And you’re right about a lot of things.	Na woayɛ no yiye wɔ nneɛma pii ho.
I hope it works well.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
His hand hurt to touch her.	Ne nsa yɛɛ no ​​yaw sɛ ɔde ne nsa bɛka no.
The boy only looks.	Abarimaa no hwɛ nkutoo.
No one is perfect.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ pɛ.
So, do something!.	Enti, yɛ biribi!.
I want sex.	Mepɛ nna.
That’s how he was.	Saa na na ɔte.
This will be good for him.	Eyi bɛyɛ papa ama no.
Very good situation.	Tebea pa ara.
It’s a lot of fun.	Ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
You get the idea.	Wo nsa ka adwene no.
Music has to address that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nnwom di saa asɛm no ho dwuma.
Thank you for your great work.	Meda mo ase wɔ mo adwuma kɛse no ho.
I didn’t know what.	Ná minnim dɛn.
There wasn’t much time.	Na bere pii nni hɔ.
A few books.	Nhoma kakraa bi.
Don’t do this to yourself.	Mma wonyɛ eyi mma wo ho.
There would be a number of people.	Ná nnipa dodow bi bɛba.
Now the situation is tense.	Seesei tebea no mu yɛ den.
This was not a school.	Ná eyi nyɛ sukuu.
It’s just the way it is.	Ɛyɛ sɛnea ɛte ara kwa.
He’s happy to do that.	N’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
That’s the best part.	Ɛno ne nea eye sen biara.
He wants a kitten to play with him.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔkraman ba bi ne no bedi agoru.
New things come with incredible frequency.	Nneɛma foforo ba mpɛn pii a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It was an interesting story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
There must be more people here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nnipa pii wɔ ha.
He dropped the gun.	Ɔde tuo no too fam.
Not at work, not at home.	Ɛnyɛ adwumam, ɛnyɛ fie.
All of that is just window dressing.	Saa nneɛma no nyinaa yɛ mfɛnsere a wɔde hyɛ mu ara kwa.
It’s a difficult job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den.
Without a doubt, water is essential for life.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nsu ho hia na ama obi anya nkwa.
We had so many people.	Ná yɛwɔ nnipa pii saa.
Serve at room temperature or cold.	Fa ma wɔ dan mu hyew anaa awɔw mu.
You can’t prove anything to anyone.	Worentumi mfa biribiara nkyerɛ obiara.
A great deal of stuff.	Ade kɛse bi.
And he gave me a hug.	Na ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ me.
After all that work.	Saa adwuma no nyinaa akyi.
She’s obviously a good girl.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔyɛ abeawa pa.
I know you know how beautiful you are.	Minim sɛ wunim sɛnea wo ho yɛ fɛ.
However, this is the only problem.	Nanso, eyi nkutoo ne ɔhaw a ɛwɔ hɔ.
Look at what he has.	Hwɛ nea ɔwɔ.
He gave me a smile.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ me.
This made me feel better.	Eyi maa me ho tɔɔ me.
If you ever.	Sɛ wo da bi a.
I thought it sounded like a good idea.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛte sɛ adwene pa.
Everything in it, he wanted.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ mu no, na ɔpɛ.
However, that is not my path.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno ne me kwan.
There is no way.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ.
Maybe it still is.	Ebia ɛda so ara te saa.
I know more about him than you do.	Minim ne ho nsɛm pii sen mo.
The house was built of materials.	Wɔde nneɛma a wɔde yɛ nneɛma na esii ofie no.
It sounds like a great plan.	Ɛte sɛ nhyehyɛe kɛse bi.
As you can see, he was very happy.	Sɛnea wubetumi ahu no, na n’ani agye yiye.
At least for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, me.
Most people agree with that.	Nnipa dodow no ara gye tom saa.
And it was a good story.	Na ɛyɛ asɛm pa.
It’s not a one-man view.	Ɛnyɛ ɔbarima biako ho adwene.
Think about this for a moment.	Susuw eyi ho kakra.
But it’s still relatively fast.	Nanso ɛda so ara yɛ ntɛmntɛm kakra.
I felt his power go away.	Metee nka sɛ ne tumi no rekɔ.
I should like to tell you about them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mepɛ sɛ meka wɔn ho asɛm kyerɛ mo.
Not that night.	Ɛnyɛ saa anadwo no.
Very interesting stuff.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
My legs hurt.	Me nan ase yɛɛ no ​​yaw.
All the kids love you.	Mmofra no nyinaa pɛ wo.
I wanted to do it now.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ mprempren.
I could think of nothing but them.	Ná mintumi nsusuw biribiara ho gye wɔn.
Just think of it this way!	Susuw ho wɔ saa kwan yi so kɛkɛ!
It was nothing new.	Ná ɛnyɛ ade foforo.
He has to hit his head on something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ ne ti wɔ biribi so.
He is always willing to help people.	Ɔwɔ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔbɛboa nkurɔfo bere nyinaa.
One thing is for sure, though.	Nanso, ade biako ne sɛ.
But there are two situations.	Nanso tebea abien na ɛwɔ hɔ.
What you believe matters.	Nea wugye di no ho hia.
This dog is beautiful.	Saa ɔkraman yi yɛ fɛ.
I'm sure it would be a lot of fun.	Migye di sɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
He is an only child.	Ɔyɛ abofra koro pɛ.
I think there is a reason for that.	Misusuw sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
I hurt you.	Meyɛɛ wo yaw.
He was sentenced to life imprisonment.	Wɔde no too afiase ne nkwa nna nyinaa.
I have to do something with it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede yɛ biribi.
And he was very interested in that.	Na n’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho kɛse.
When people are interested in a story, they respond.	Sɛ nkurɔfo ani gye asɛm bi ho a, wɔyɛ ho biribi.
It was huge, amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse, ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Why he didn't know, and for now it didn't matter.	Nea enti a na onnim, na mprempren de na ɛnyɛ hwee.
We all have a past.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ bere bi a atwam.
I have done them in a year.	Mayɛ wɔn afe biako mu.
I understand that he has the absolute power over me.	Mete ase sɛ ɔno na ɔwɔ tumi a edi mũ sen biara wɔ me so.
This may be a mistake.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ mfomso.
His mother knew nothing about it.	Ná ne maame nnim ho hwee.
They liked the idea.	Wɔn ani gyee adwene no ho.
The child sat under the table.	Abofra no traa pon no ase.
I look down at my old shoes.	Mehwɛ me mpaboa dedaw no ase.
He was a troublemaker.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔhaw adwene.
People liked his comments.	Nkurɔfo ani gyee ne nsɛm no ho.
However, no such reliable system exists today.	Nanso, nhyehyɛe a ɛte saa a wɔde wɔn ho to so nni hɔ a ɛwɔ hɔ nnɛ.
That kind of guy doesn’t look like that.	Ɔbarima a ɔte saa no nte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
Just try again.	Bɔ mmɔden bio kɛkɛ.
I’m going to go too.	Me nso mɛkɔ.
I had a gun.	Ná mewɔ tuo.
It’s their opinion.	Ɛyɛ wɔn adwene.
Or his last name.	Anaasɛ ne din a etwa to.
So you have to tell.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ woka kyerɛ.
Someone had to be in control if something went wrong.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ obi di so sɛ biribi nkɔ yiye a.
Allow as much hydration as possible.	Ma kwan ma wo ho yɛ nsu pii sɛnea wubetumi.
I am here with you.	Mewɔ ha wɔ wo nkyɛn.
He was the man's dog.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima no kraman.
He wanted me to go.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ mekɔ.
It was definitely difficult.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛyɛ den.
We had a few ourselves.	Ná yɛn ankasa wɔ kakraa bi.
Even then hope will come to us.	Saa bere no mpo anidaso bɛba yɛn so.
That’s a terrible thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu.
Get out for you.	Fi adi ma wo.
It’s a quick and easy way.	Ɛyɛ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ ntɛm na ɛnyɛ den.
Wisdom is a will.	Nyansa yɛ ɔpɛ.
I need to sleep with him again.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no da bio.
That is a dangerous job.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma a asiane wom.
It seems to be the only language he really understands.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno nkutoo ne kasa a ɔte ase ankasa.
Those words still haunt me.	Saa nsɛm no da so ara haw me.
This is a truly amazing opportunity.	Eyi yɛ hokwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
To me they are books.	Me fam no wɔyɛ nhoma.
Many run fast.	Pii tu mmirika denneennen.
Every role he plays is breathtaking.	Dwuma biara a odi no yɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Water becomes steam.	Nsu dan nsu a ɛyɛ hyew.
Something happened, happened, something happened.	Biribi sii, sii, biribi sii.
I've been thinking about you.	Mayɛ wo ho adwene.
How much it costs.	Sɛnea ɛho ka yɛ.
Something happened.	Asɛm bi sii.
Two were human beings.	Na baanu yɛ nnipa.
Good or bad.	Eye anaa bɔne.
You get one.	Wo nsa ka biako.
The dog ate the food.	Ɔkraman no dii aduan no.
I know for sure.	Minim ampa.
I have many pictures of our room.	Mewɔ yɛn dan no ho mfonini pii.
This has worked for him.	Eyi ayɛ adwuma ama no.
He glanced quickly around the room.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ dan no mu ntɛmntɛm.
He would do that.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ saa.
Or, they invested well.	Anaasɛ, wɔde wɔn sika hyɛɛ mu yiye.
Which is really scary.	Nea ɛyɛ hu ankasa.
However, whether he liked the movie or not, it didn’t matter.	Nanso, sɛ́ n’ani gye sini no ho anaasɛ n’ani nnye ho no, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
It may work but it shouldn’t.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ adwuma nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
He wanted to play.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ odi agoru.
This may be a problem.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ ɔhaw.
This method is very dangerous.	Saa kwan yi yɛ hu kɛse.
I saw them this past summer, and they were fantastic.	Mihuu wɔn wɔ awɔw bere a atwam yi mu, na na wɔyɛ nwonwa.
It is not an easy task.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Your focus is another.	Wo adwene a wode besi so no yɛ ade foforo.
Someone will be there right away.	Obi bɛba hɔ ntɛm ara.
Take what you will from this.	Fa nea wopɛ fi eyi mu.
Do the best you can.	Yɛ nea eye sen biara a wubetumi.
It’s always me in the wrong.	Ɛyɛ me na mewɔ bɔne mu bere nyinaa.
People couldn’t believe it then.	Na nkurɔfo ntumi nnye nni saa bere no.
It was a built-in system.	Ná ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe bi a wɔde ahyɛ mu.
I was shocked.	Me ho dwiriw me.
Being a man has nothing to do with it.	Ɔbarima a obi bɛyɛ no ne no nni hwee yɛ.
That is not the point.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
The music has been great too.	Nnwom no nso ayɛ kɛse.
For the most part, though.	Nanso, ne fã kɛse no ara.
At least it’s complete.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ nea edi mũ.
There is nothing else to see here.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a wubetumi ahu wɔ ha.
And that’s what he’s going to do.	Na ɛno ne nea ɔbɛyɛ.
This was known.	Ná eyi nim.
He certainly doesn’t know.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ onnim.
So hair comes from non-hair.	Enti nhwi fi nea ɛnyɛ nhwi mu.
If it hurts, enjoy it.	Sɛ ɛyɛ wo yaw a, ma w’ani nnye ho.
Maybe he did it himself.	Ebia ɔno ankasa na ɔyɛɛ saa.
I always wanted to look good.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ho yɛ fɛ bere nyinaa.
However, something terrible.	Nanso, biribi a ɛyɛ hu.
I know exactly what happened.	Minim nea esii no yiye.
It will be good for me.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa ama me.
That should be easy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ mmerɛw.
That’s the only thing you need to do now.	Ɛno nkutoo ne ade a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ mprempren.
It was a door.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔpon bi.
I can handle it well.	Metumi adi so yiye.
It was used for three reasons.	Nneɛma abiɛsa nti na wɔde dii dwuma.
And that’s what you want.	Na ɛno ne nea wopɛ.
I have a child.	Mewɔ abofra bi.
It had been difficult.	Ná ayɛ den.
It was like I was.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea meyɛ.
I did that right.	Meyɛɛ saa asɛm no yiye.
And both of them are.	Ne abien no nyinaa yɛ.
Here are a few applications.	Nnwuma kakraa bi a wɔde di dwuma ni.
However, I knew my mother.	Nanso, na minim me maame.
I think you’ll enjoy it.	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ho.
Been there and done that.	Akɔ hɔ na wayɛ saa.
His mind was clear.	Ná n’adwene mu da hɔ.
He gave me a smile.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ me.
Animals return to the present moment.	Mmoa san kɔ mprempren bere yi mu.
You can’t do everything for everyone.	Worentumi nyɛ biribiara mma obiara.
What are your favorite songs?	Nnwom bɛn na w’ani gye ho paa?
That, is the power of man.	Ɛno, ne tumi a onipa wɔ.
The road hit them.	Ɔkwan no bɔɔ wɔn ase.
No one told him to do this.	Obiara anka ankyerɛ no sɛ ɔnyɛ eyi.
The same is true of us.	Saa ara na yɛn nso yɛbɛyɛ.
Taste the water.	Ka nsu no hwɛ.
And we all know where that’s going to lead.	Na yɛn nyinaa nim baabi a ɛno de bɛkɔ.
I don’t want to see things.	Mempɛ sɛ mihu nneɛma.
I can't tell how many there might be.	Mintumi nhu dodow a ebia ɛwɔ hɔ no.
Too much simplicity.	Pii dodo a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Everyone is really him.	Obiara ne no ankasa.
Who’s next?	Hena na odi hɔ?
Not everyone is going to like you, and it doesn’t matter.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na n’ani begye wo ho, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
I never should have told him.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no da.
You don’t like this at all.	W’ani nnye eyi ho koraa.
However, all of this did not happen overnight.	Nanso, eyi nyinaa amma da koro pɛ.
That’s how it should be.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
But this was all really beside the point.	Nanso na eyi nyinaa wɔ asɛm no nkyɛn ankasa.
He is in me.	Ɔwɔ me mu.
And yet, it is.	Na nanso, ɛte saa.
I have no issue with that.	Minni asɛm biara wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Only his head felt great.	Ne ti nkutoo na na ɔte nka sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse.
He is not strong.	Ɔnyɛ den.
And he would do the same.	Na ɔno nso bɛyɛ saa.
Only you can bring this to an end.	Wo nkutoo na wubetumi de eyi aba awiei.
Someone who knew a little about your people.	Obi a na onim mo nkurɔfo ho nsɛm kakra.
I didn’t like or want anything.	Ná m’ani nnye biribiara ho anaasɛ na mempɛ biribiara.
The background plan is.	Nhyehyɛe a ɛwɔ akyi no ne.
He looked worse than she thought.	Ná ne ho yɛ bɔne sen sɛnea na osusuw.
We really have to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ankasa.
I am new to this, and would appreciate any help.	Meyɛ foforo wɔ eyi mu, na m’ani begye mmoa biara ho.
You can get over that in a matter of days.	Wubetumi adi saa asɛm no so wɔ nna kakraa bi mu.
He was so full of joy at his departure.	Ná anigye ahyɛ no ma kɛse wɔ ne kɔ no mu.
There have been some good and bad things.	Nneɛma pa ne nneɛma bɔne bi aba.
No one says he did.	Obiara nka sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
Be sure and make sure he hears.	Hwɛ hu na hwɛ hu sɛ ɔte.
The story shocked people.	Asɛm no maa nkurɔfo ho dwiriw wɔn.
She was absolutely thrilled, her mother was absolutely thrilled, to this day.	Na n’ani agye koraa, na ne maame ani agye koraa, de besi nnɛ.
Those things.	Saa nneɛma no.
He had nothing more to say.	Ná onni asɛm biara a ɔbɛka bio.
What have you done?	Woayɛ dɛn?
Everyone has their own opinion.	Obiara wɔ n’adwene.
And people did that.	Na nkurɔfo yɛɛ saa.
If you see anything, tell me right away.	Sɛ wuhu biribi a, ka kyerɛ me ntɛm ara.
I would have told you sooner.	Anka mɛka akyerɛ wo ntɛm.
I wasn’t any good.	Ná menyɛ papa biara.
Maybe that’s why.	Ebia ɛno nti na.
But that’s not really the point here.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no ankasa wɔ ha.
At least not for a long time, and not today.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ bere tenten, na ɛnyɛ nnɛ nso.
A wonderful evening.	Anwummere a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
My wife doesn’t work outside the home.	Me yere nyɛ adwuma wɔ fie akyi.
I'm strong.	Meyɛ den.
And many of them were quite good.	Na na wɔn mu pii yɛ papa koraa.
This was no accident.	Na eyi nyɛ akwanhyia.
This can cause problems.	Eyi betumi de ɔhaw ahorow aba.
I have to go home.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ fie.
Not all those involved are bad people.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho ahyɛ mu no nyinaa na wɔyɛ nnipa bɔne.
That said, most people have no idea how they work.	Ɛno akyi no, nnipa dodow no ara nni sɛnea wɔyɛ adwuma no ho adwene biara.
You have to save yourself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye wo ho nkwa.
We have something for one season and something for another.	Yɛwɔ biribi ma bere bi na yɛwɔ biribi ma bere foforo.
I can’t understand them.	Mintumi nte wɔn ase.
The next issue was difficult.	Ná asɛm a edi hɔ no yɛ den.
It was a squirrel.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔkraman.
That’s the plan.	Ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no.
However, the latter is possible.	Nanso, nea etwa to no betumi ayɛ yiye.
I'm for that.	Meyɛ ma ɛno.
Just be yourself and have fun.	Yɛ wo ho kɛkɛ na gye w’ani.
We have just that man in our sights.	Yɛwɔ saa ɔbarima no ara wɔ yɛn ani so.
His mother was not at home.	Ná ne maame nni fie.
They really liked that stuff.	Ná wɔn ani gye saa nneɛma no ho ankasa.
More children than ever before.	Mmofra pii sen bere biara.
More about them later.	Wɔn ho nsɛm pii akyiri yi.
You can certainly tell their character.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wubetumi ahu wɔn su.
I’m glad they’re new.	M’ani agye sɛ wɔyɛ foforo.
Very little is said at the meeting.	Wɔka kakraa bi pɛ wɔ nhyiam no ase.
I want you to know that as soon as possible.	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu saa ntɛm ara sɛnea wubetumi.
Even this last year.	Eyi mpo afe a etwaam no.
Many people work long hours here.	Nnipa pii yɛ adwuma nnɔnhwerew pii wɔ ha.
However, there are two that are really popular.	Nanso, abien na ɛwɔ hɔ a nkurɔfo ani gye ho ankasa.
They were happy and excited.	Ná wɔn ani agye na wɔn ani agye.
You can make a lot of money.	Wubetumi anya sika pii.
You know why you are here.	Wunim nea enti a wowɔ ha no.
I hope you like how it looks.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye sɛnea ɛte no ho.
That’s one of the things.	Ɛno ne nneɛma no mu biako.
He has always been good to you.	Wayɛ mo yiye bere nyinaa.
That’s really exciting.	Ɛno yɛ anigye ankasa.
So, that’s what he wanted to do.	Enti, ɛno ne nea na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
It’s a huge risk.	Ɛyɛ asiane kɛse.
Many animals have a short life span.	Mmoa pii nkwa nna yɛ tiaa.
The problems are getting worse.	Ɔhaw ahorow no reyɛ kɛse.
It was a beautiful party.	Ná ɛyɛ apontow a ɛyɛ fɛ.
However, it is not.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ saa.
For me, the money doesn’t matter.	Me fam no, sika no nyɛ hwee.
And this was nothing new.	Na na eyi nyɛ ade foforo.
That path is life.	Saa kwan no ne nkwa.
Show me.	Kyerɛ me.
Do this for me.	Yɛ eyi ma me.
It is more difficult.	Ɛyɛ den kɛse.
Some of the images will move but not all.	Mfonini no bi bɛkɔ baabi foforo nanso ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa.
I know why you are here.	Minim nea enti a wowɔ ha.
I definitely feel for you.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mete nka ma wo.
Even his mother knew about it.	Ná ne maame mpo nim ho asɛm.
He loved this group.	Ná n’ani gye kuw yi ho.
But he has no time for this now.	Nanso onni bere mma eyi mprempren.
Tell me his name again, first and last.	Ka ne din bio kyerɛ me, nea edi kan ne nea etwa to.
The same goes for the application.	Saa ara na sɛnea wɔde di dwuma no nso te.
The details were added.	Wɔde nsɛm no mu nsɛm kaa ho.
I didn’t even like it.	Ná m’ani nnye ho mpo.
I didn’t think there was.	Na minsusuw sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
The work is not that expensive.	Adwuma no bo nyɛ den saa.
It wasn’t like that.	Ná ɛnte saa.
But that doesn’t solve everything.	Nanso ɛno ntumi nni biribiara ho dwuma.
Be honest with me now.	Di me nokware mprempren.
Start with him.	Fi ase fi ne so.
I don’t want you here in that situation.	Mempɛ sɛ wowɔ ha wɔ saa tebea no mu.
We will add your money as soon as possible.	Yɛde wo sika no bɛka ho ntɛm ara sɛnea yebetumi.
I have a job to do.	Mewɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
But that’s not a new idea.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ adwene foforo.
Another language.	Kasa foforo.
It’s not a mistake.	Ɛnyɛ mfomso.
I really can’t do that.	Ankasa mintumi nyɛ saa.
Way, way too hard.	Ɔkwan, kwan a ɛyɛ den dodo.
I shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
That surprised me a lot.	Ɛno yɛɛ me nwonwa yiye.
Which didn’t have much new.	Nea na foforo pii nni mu.
Besides, we have a plan.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, yɛwɔ nhyehyɛe bi.
She is a good girl.	Ɔyɛ abeawa pa.
And boy, does it work.	Na abarimaa, so ɛyɛ adwuma.
Keep going and keep going.	Kɔ so kɔ so.
He has no real power.	Onni tumi ankasa biara.
He could have gone.	Ná obetumi akɔ.
I didn’t want to look into it.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu.
So everything is a go.	Enti biribiara yɛ kɔ.
You’re here, that’s what matters.	Wowɔ ha, ɛno ne nea ɛho hia.
He has been dangerous.	Wayɛ asiane.
We will do our best for you, anyway.	Yɛbɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara ama wo, sɛnea ɛte biara.
Again, he probably is.	Bio nso, ebia ɔte saa.
He could have used the money for more interesting things.	Anka obetumi de sika no ayɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
These people got to make a statement.	Saa nkurɔfo yi nyaa kwan kaa asɛm bi.
I'm heading out now.	Mede m’ani kyerɛ abɔnten mprempren.
I have to disagree with that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne saa asɛm no nyɛ adwene.
He is a beautiful boy.	Ɔyɛ abarimaa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He was late for work.	Ná aka akyi wɔ adwuma mu.
There is no money in that.	Sika biara nni saa asɛm no mu.
Look at the time.	Hwɛ bere no.
It is unlikely that we will be able to discern this wisdom.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye sɛ yebetumi ahu saa nyansa yi.
Few of his kind do.	Ne su no mu kakraa bi na wɔyɛ saa.
Today's meeting did not go well.	Nnɛ nhyiam no ankɔ yiye.
Give him a place.	Ma no baabi.
He has given a statement.	Ɔde asɛm bi ama.
My headaches got worse.	Me ti a ɛyɛ me yaw no mu yɛɛ den.
We’re both very excited about it.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa ani agye ho yiye.
One has to be careful these days.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi hwɛ yiye nnansa yi.
What is this? 	Dɛn ne eyi?
It was really that.	Ná ɛte saa ankasa.
He had a good attitude.	Ná ɔwɔ adwene pa.
That’s a lot of good.	Ɛno yɛ papa pii.
I've been wanting to do this for a while.	Mede mepɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi bere tiaa bi.
Everyone seemed to think this was a good idea.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obiara susuw sɛ eyi yɛ adwene pa.
He knows that too.	Ɔno nso nim saa asɛm no.
But forget about that.	Nanso wo werɛ mfi saa asɛm no.
Some of it, anyway.	Ne bi, sɛnea ɛte biara.
Another power.	Tumi foforo.
He may be working off the books.	Ebia ɔreyɛ adwuma afi nhoma ahorow no so.
Remember the grand plan.	Kae nhyehyɛe kɛse no.
His speech was not very strong, but it was interesting.	Ná ne kasa no mu nyɛ den koraa, nanso na ɛyɛ anigye.
No one had done this before.	Ná obiara nyɛɛ eyi da.
Thank you very much.	Meda mo ase pii.
He was himself.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔno ankasa.
He was too much of everything.	Ná ɔyɛ biribiara dodo.
Something matters, or it doesn’t.	Biribi ho hia, anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
Thank you and I will use you again.	Meda wo ase na mede wo bedi dwuma bio.
Nothing or nothing complicated is required.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ ade biara anaa biribiara a ɛyɛ den.
And the real problem in game.	Na ɔhaw a ɛwɔ agoru mu ankasa no.
Please do hope this works for you.	Mesrɛ wo ɛyɛ anidaso sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma ma wo.
This was very easy.	Ná eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
He doesn’t do that.	Ɔnyɛ saa.
I understood it all too well.	Metee ne nyinaa ase yiye dodo.
Make sure everything is set to your liking.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wɔde biribiara ahyɛ nea wopɛ.
This can mean a variety of things.	Eyi betumi akyerɛ nneɛma ahorow.
I look at my eyes.	Mehwɛ m’ani so.
That may be difficult.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ den.
Or just keep it.	Anaasɛ di so kɛkɛ.
That is not a problem.	Ɛno nyɛ ɔhaw biara.
The street is empty.	Abɔnten so yɛ baabi a hwee nni hɔ.
It wasn’t really that.	Ná ɛnyɛ saa ankasa.
There is nothing in it for him.	Biribiara nni mu mma no.
Definitely a must-hear.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ obi te.
And so that exists now.	Na enti ɛno wɔ hɔ mprempren.
I've done that.	Mayɛ saa.
The homeless man raised his hand.	Ɔbarima a onni ofie no maa ne nsa so.
It’s all not good.	Ne nyinaa nyɛ papa.
You have to be, like, your best.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ, te sɛ, wo nea eye sen biara.
We can’t talk about that.	Yɛrentumi nka saa asɛm no ho asɛm.
But the underlying problem didn’t go away.	Nanso ɔhaw a ɛwɔ ase no ankɔ.
I put it to good use.	Mede yɛɛ adwuma yiye.
It’s not dangerous.	Ɛnyɛ asiane.
I find that beautiful.	Mihu sɛ ɛno yɛ fɛ.
It was only a matter of time before people did.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi ansa na nkurɔfo ayɛ saa.
Remember how we used to.	Kae sɛnea na yɛyɛ no kan no.
It was a very strange moment.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
A great dinner out after a long day of travelling.	Anwummere aduan kɛse a wɔde tu kwan da tenten akyi.
We looked at him with interest.	Yɛde anigye hwɛɛ no.
I’m absolutely thrilled.	M’ani gyee ho koraa.
I had a better idea, anyway.	Ná mewɔ adwene a eye sen saa, sɛnea ɛte biara.
None of them came for anything.	Wɔn mu biara amma biribiara ho.
You see the story never ends.	Wuhu sɛ asɛm no mma awiei da.
The work is now in progress.	Mprempren adwuma no rekɔ so.
But he did use it.	Nanso ɔde dii dwuma ampa.
Just a little bit.	Kakraa bi kɛkɛ.
I don’t have the money to buy anything.	Minni sika a mede bɛtɔ biribiara.
As a man.	Sɛ́ ɔbarima.
His mother was gone.	Ná ne maame nni hɔ bio.
The books look interesting.	Nhoma ahorow no hwɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
But this doesn’t work.	Nanso eyi nyɛ adwuma.
I do, but that doesn’t matter now.	Meyɛ saa, nanso ɛno ho nhia mprempren.
You're just worried.	Wo ho haw wo ara kwa.
It will also be the last.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea etwa to nso.
Nothing went inside.	Biribiara ankɔ mu.
It’s all in these amazing costumes.	Ne nyinaa wɔ saa ntade a ɛyɛ nwonwa yi mu.
At least not with him.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ ne nkyɛn.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara rekɔ so yiye.
He was just here.	Ná ɔwɔ ha ara kwa.
And it was very exciting.	Na ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
Do your homework now!	Yɛ wo fie nnwuma mprempren!
We need to make a new plan.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nhyehyɛe foforo.
The squirrel is an animal.	Ɔkraman yɛ aboa.
I like that way too, you know.	M’ani gye saa kwan no nso ho, wunim.
It wasn’t a plan.	Na ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
I hope someone can point me in the right direction.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ obi betumi akyerɛ me kwan pa.
He gave her some money.	Ɔde sika bi maa no.
This is the last one.	Eyi ne nea etwa to no.
One way or another, it is over before it begins.	Ɔkwan biako so anaa ɔkwan foforo so no, aba awiei ansa na afi ase.
This has already gone far enough.	Eyi akɔ akyiri sɛnea ɛsɛ dedaw.
The same thing will happen again.	Saa ara na ɛbɛyɛ bio.
There is a way.	Ɔkwan bi wɔ hɔ.
It’s a huge risk.	Ɛyɛ asiane kɛse.
I need to work on myself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ me ho adwuma.
It’s that simple, and that hard.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa, na ɛyɛ den saa.
I can’t do anything about this.	Mintumi nyɛ eyi ho hwee.
Close your windows at night.	To wo mfɛnsere mu anadwo.
The bus was late.	Ná bɔs no aka akyi.
That would be good for the other guy.	Ɛno bɛyɛ papa ama ɔbarima foforo no.
A good man.	Onipa pa.
Most everyone does, from time to time.	Obiara dodow no ara yɛ saa, bere ne bere mu.
It was a beautiful night.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo a ɛyɛ fɛ.
He was no longer in his room.	Ná onni ne dan mu bio.
Stay in the present.	Tra mprempren tebea no mu.
As we become stronger.	Bere a yɛyɛ den kɛse no.
We can go on and on.	Yebetumi akɔ so akɔ so ayɛ saa.
Lots of opportunities for everyone.	Hokwan pii ma obiara.
But only for a few days.	Nanso nna kakraa bi pɛ.
The pictures below tell the story.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛwɔ ase hɔ no ka ne ho asɛm.
I am very good at it.	Me ho akokwaw wɔ mu yiye.
Don’t let anything go.	Mma biribiara nkɔ.
The boy doesn’t mean that.	Abarimaa no nkyerɛ saa.
And so will yours.	Na saa ara na wo de nso bɛyɛ.
At least not at all.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ koraa.
Not that anyone asked my opinion.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ obi bisaa m’adwene.
If for some reason you are not happy at all,	Sɛ biribi nti, w’ani nnye koraa a, .
And the movie is about the same.	Na sini no fa saa ara ho.
It was very quick.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛm paa.
Let the objects know they are here.	Ma nneɛma no nhu sɛ ɛwɔ ha.
It’s still awesome.	Ɛda so ara yɛ hu.
For each and everyone here.	Ma obiara ne obiara a ɔwɔ ha.
and that is close.	na ɛno bɛn.
Man, those are the days.	Onipa, ɛno ne nna no.
You have the most important job.	Wowɔ adwuma a ɛho hia sen biara.
It wasn’t like that.	Ná ɛnte saa.
It should be fun.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
Things are moving fast.	Nneɛma rekɔ so ntɛmntɛm.
She makes her own clothes.	Ɔno ankasa na ɔyɛ ntade.
I look at them.	Mehwɛ wɔn.
There was no one there.	Na obiara nni hɔ.
It was part of the plan.	Ná ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe no fã.
He had no friends to play with.	Ná onni nnamfo a ɔne wɔn bedi agoru.
Please show me another dress.	Mesrɛ wo, kyerɛ me atade foforo.
Turn around.	Dan wo ho.
Remember, not every meal has to be a feast.	Kae sɛ ɛnyɛ aduan biara na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ apontow.
It’s not a bad thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade bɔne.
Everything was going on.	Ná biribiara rekɔ so.
I can show him my stuff.	Metumi de me nneɛma akyerɛ no.
More chapters are needed.	Ti pii ho hia.
Who really knows.	Hena na onim ankasa.
Her hair is not so nice.	Ne ti nhwi no nyɛ fɛ yiye saa.
My mother was not well.	Ná me maame ho nyɛ den.
The rhetoric of action.	Nsɛm a wɔka de yɛ ade.
I found out more about them.	Mihuu wɔn ho nsɛm pii.
He was totally focused on the books.	Ná ɔde n’adwene asi nhoma ahorow no so koraa.
But there are those who do and give of themselves in this way.	Nanso wɔn a wɔyɛ saa na wɔde wɔn ho ma wɔ saa kwan yi so wɔ hɔ.
It will all be	Ne nyinaa bɛyɛ .
I am still the same.	Meda so ara te saa.
But you lived with it.	Nanso wo ne no traa ase.
But only the size was intimidating.	Nanso ne kɛse nkutoo na na ɛyɛ hu.
I wanted more children.	Ná mepɛ mmofra pii.
The food is simple.	Aduan no yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Everything is this story is true indeed.	Biribiara yɛ saa asɛm yi yɛ nokware ampa.
It’s a problem, a real problem.	Ɛyɛ ɔhaw, ɔhaw ankasa.
The same should be said for photographs.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka saa ara wɔ mfonini ahorow ho.
Someone might want it again at night.	Ebia obi bɛpɛ bio anadwo.
You might say something.	Ebia wobɛka biribi.
So it has to be me.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ me.
It was amazing, indeed.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa, ampa.
The phone rings all the time.	Telefon no bɔ bere nyinaa.
At least for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ me fam.
It was a good one.	Ná ɛyɛ papa.
This weekend seemed like the perfect time.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea dapɛn awiei yi yɛ bere a eye sen biara.
If someone can do it, they can.	Sɛ obi tumi yɛ a, obetumi.
I expect you can drive inside.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ wubetumi de kar akɔ mu.
He had no plans for today.	Ná onni nhyehyɛe biara mma nnɛ.
The boy was placed on the road.	Wɔde abarimaa no too kwan no so.
And it was getting later in the year.	Na na ɛrekɔ akyiri wɔ afe no mu.
Or the other way around.	Anaasɛ ɔkwan foforo so no.
It does those things really fast.	Ɛyɛ saa nneɛma no ntɛmntɛm ankasa.
I can’t do a pretty thing.	Mintumi nyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
This is also my plan.	Eyi nso ne me nhyehyɛe.
He did this tonight.	Ɔyɛɛ saa anadwo yi.
The school of .	Sukuu a ɛwɔ .
I didn’t know what to do.	Ná minnim nea menyɛ.
She prefers paper books.	Ɔpɛ nhoma a wɔde krataa ayɛ.
I preferred his film to that one.	Ná mepɛ ne sini no sen saa sini no.
But there is nothing on this but my name.	Nanso biribiara nni eyi so gye me din.
his mother asked him.	ne maame bisaa no.
There was absolutely nothing.	Ná ade biara nni hɔ koraa.
Give me the phone.	Ma me telefon no.
However, the real thing was not the point.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ ade ankasa no ne asɛm no.
This test was not realistic.	Ná sɔhwɛ yi nyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
I get along really well with everyone.	Me ne obiara di yiye ankasa.
Many ingredients.	Nneɛma pii a wɔde yɛ ade.
Perhaps the same is true here.	Ebia ɛte saa nso wɔ ha.
Let the matter be my attention immediately.	Ma asɛm no nyɛ m’adwene ntɛm ara.
There will be a time for that.	Bere bi bɛba ama ɛno.
But we are good at what we do.	Nanso yɛn ho akokwaw wɔ nea yɛyɛ no mu.
At least that is the case for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na ɛte wɔ me fam.
I love that first week of school.	M’ani gye saa dapɛn a edi kan wɔ sukuu mu no ho.
Like many people.	Te sɛ nnipa pii.
I’m there, and you’re there.	Me wɔ hɔ, na wo nso wowɔ hɔ.
I couldn’t find anything.	Ná mintumi nnya hwee.
More on these virtues in a moment.	Saa su pa ahorow yi ho nsɛm pii wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
Everything they said was the same.	Ná biribiara a wɔka no yɛ pɛ.
I believe there is much more to do.	Migye di sɛ pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
Your shoes of hope.	Wo mpaboa a ɛyɛ anidaso.
Or at least he thought he had.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, na osusuw sɛ wayɛ saa.
Man has a little wisdom, and he must use it.	Onipa wɔ nyansa kakra, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde di dwuma.
I'll try one.	Meka biako hwɛ.
That is also very important.	Ɛno nso ho hia paa.
I can’t do it now.	Mintumi nyɛ mprempren.
But it was hard to tell.	Nanso na ɛyɛ den sɛ mɛka.
The story is fresh and new, at least to me.	Asɛm no yɛ foforo na ɛyɛ foforo, anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ me fam.
And your name?.	Na wo din de?.
Did everything go well?	So biribiara kɔɔ yiye?
It’s enough for him.	Ɛdɔɔso ma no.
But the story doesn’t go that far.	Nanso asɛm no nkɔ akyiri saa.
It was too cold.	Ná awɔw wom dodo.
This product does not solve the problem.	Saa ade yi ntumi nni ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
That’s what really mattered.	Ɛno ne nea na ɛho hia ankasa.
There wasn’t much space either.	Ná baabi pii nso nni hɔ.
It didn’t have to be that way.	Na enhia sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I hoped he was, anyway.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔte saa, ɔkwan biara so.
I received it the next day.	Me nsa kaa no da a edi hɔ no.
Mom is desperate.	Maame abam abu.
But this man is not.	Nanso ɔbarima yi nyɛ saa.
He liked being busy and important.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ onni adagyew na ɛho hia.
Which actually plays a role in the film.	Nea edi dwuma wɔ sini no mu ankasa.
We have a lot of things to do.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
Mine is the first one.	Me de no ne nea edi kan.
And that just started falling apart.	Na ɛno fii ase hwee ase ara kwa.
Remove any leftovers.	Yi nea aka biara fi hɔ.
Maybe I'll do the same.	Ebia mɛyɛ saa ara.
This is a great car.	Eyi yɛ kar kɛse bi.
I can do more, better.	Metumi ayɛ pii, ayɛ papa.
Bad days, good days.	Nna bɔne, nna pa.
Maybe you can help him?	Ebia wubetumi aboa no?
I think it's pretty obvious that there is.	Misusuw sɛ ɛda adi yiye sɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ no wɔ hɔ.
It works the other way, too.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ɔkwan foforo so, nso.
And your numbers were dwindling.	Na na mo dodow rekɔ fam.
But you don’t have to.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
It’s a good one.	Ɛyɛ papa.
Good, good, this was good.	Eye, eye, na eyi yɛ papa.
I am working on it.	Mereyɛ ne ho adwuma.
It would seem more so than people.	Ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛte saa kɛse sen nnipa.
So, the problem remains.	Enti, ɔhaw no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
All these years and years.	Mfe ne mfe yi nyinaa.
That’s the problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
They were completely unimportant.	Ná wɔn ho nhia koraa.
It’s my habit.	Ɛyɛ me su.
That must be kind of weird for him.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa bi ma no.
This was not his room.	Ná eyi nyɛ ne dan no.
I think one of them got into it.	Misusuw sɛ wɔn mu biako kɔɔ mu.
It’s very painful.	Ɛyɛ yaw yiye.
And that was how it was there early on.	Na saa na na ɛte wɔ hɔ ntɛm.
But some things are missing.	Nanso nneɛma bi nka ho.
He may not be in this plan at all.	Ebia na onni nhyehyɛe yi mu koraa.
I did all of those things.	Meyɛɛ saa nneɛma no nyinaa.
It’s not too complicated.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den dodo.
Live like you’re a bigger person.	Tra ase te sɛ nea woyɛ onipa kɛse.
I will take him immediately.	Mede no bɛkɔ ntɛm ara.
Just don’t go there.	Nkɔ hɔ kɛkɛ.
The long term has taken too long.	Bere tenten no agye bere tenten dodo.
We could go somewhere.	Ná yebetumi akɔ baabi.
The scenery here is beautiful.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ ha no yɛ fɛ yiye.
Interesting story.	Asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
But not in this house.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ofie yi mu.
This brings me to my first option.	Eyi de me ba me kwan a edi kan no so.
Maybe it’s not.	Ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
He lives at home now.	Ɔte fie mprempren.
There are some opportunities.	Hokwan ahorow bi wɔ hɔ.
No man wins it.	Onipa biara nni hɔ a odi nkonim wɔ so.
He seemed happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
You can’t get out of there.	Worentumi mfi hɔ.
But it was a different situation, no doubt about it.	Nanso na ɛyɛ tebea foforo, na akyinnye biara nni ho.
Most of them do that.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara yɛ saa.
Check your eyes often.	Hwɛ w’ani so mpɛn pii.
You don’t have to be one of those people.	Ɛho nhia sɛ woyɛ saa nnipa no mu biako.
That’s how much he liked it.	Saa na n’ani gyee ho kɛse.
Hopefully things will work out this time.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ nneɛma bɛkɔ yiye saa bere yi.
But no one had heard of it at the time.	Nanso na obiara nte ho asɛm saa bere no.
He didn't know how.	Ná onnim ɔkwan bɛn so.
It must be delivered, again and again.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde ma, mpɛn pii.
It’s pretty amazing though.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye nanso.
They just do that.	Wɔyɛ saa ara kwa.
He didn't want to talk about the past.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka nea atwam no ho asɛm.
Maybe his plan would actually work after all.	Ebia na ne nhyehyɛe no bɛyɛ adwuma ankasa wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
I did that this year.	Meyɛɛ saa afe yi.
Maybe anything.	Ebia biribiara.
If it is not long.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ tenten a.
So is another man.	Saa ara na ɔbarima foforo nso te.
That happened about a year ago.	Ɛno sii bɛyɛ afe a atwam ni.
This is the last one.	Eyi ne nea etwa to.
This doesn’t mean it’s a bad time for us.	Eyi nkyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bere bɔne ma yɛn.
What happened is what happened.	Nea esii no ne nea esii.
The mood is generally negative.	Mpɛn pii no, adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ no nyɛ papa.
The ingredients for this recipe are simple.	Nneɛma a wɔde yɛ saa aduan yi yɛ mmerɛw.
I should have known you better.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu wo yiye.
Just do the same thing.	Yɛ ade koro no ara ara kwa.
He is a terrible character.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hu.
It had been taken outside.	Ná wɔde akɔ abɔnten.
This is used here.	Wɔde eyi di dwuma wɔ ha.
Take more stuff immediately.	Fa nneɛma pii kɔ ntɛm ara.
The system of delivery.	Nhyehyɛe a wɔde ma no.
Not so smart for me.	Ɛnyɛ nyansa saa mma me.
On the table, under the table.	Wɔ pon no so, wɔ pon no ase.
As in all businesses, there is always some risk.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ nnwuma nyinaa mu no, asiane bi wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
I live until then.	Mete ase kosi saa bere no.
That’s the point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no.
Everyone understood why.	Obiara tee nea enti a ɛte saa no ase.
That’s what everyone always says.	Ɛno ne nea obiara ka bere nyinaa.
It all works fine in this system.	Ne nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye wɔ nhyehyɛe yi mu.
A great day of long walks.	Da kɛse a wɔde nantew tenten.
It was a good evening.	Ná ɛyɛ anwummere pa.
I don’t know what was going on with our group.	Me nnim nea na ɛrekɔ so wɔ yɛn kuw no ho.
The phone started ringing.	Telefon no fii ase bɔɔ.
He doesn’t like anyone.	Ɔmpɛ obiara asɛm.
Not a dog, or .	Ɛnyɛ ɔkraman, anaasɛ .
What a perfect opportunity!	Hokwan a edi mũ bɛn ara ni!
It didn’t seem to be true.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nokware.
Forget him now.	Wo werɛ mfi no mprempren.
We have rent authority.	Yɛwɔ dan ka ho tumi.
The man counted his money.	Ɔbarima no kan ne sika.
I had to see them all.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu wɔn nyinaa.
We have both available for you.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma abien no nyinaa a ɛwɔ hɔ ma wo.
I did the same thing.	Me nso meyɛɛ saa.
I hope they do.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
It’s pretty amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
I put it down.	Mede too hɔ.
Finally he told me so.	Awiei no ɔka kyerɛɛ me saa.
That is why this intervention was necessary.	Ɛno nti na na ɛho hia sɛ wɔde wɔn ho gye mu yi.
The complete story.	Asɛm a edi mũ no.
They were all included.	Wɔde wɔn nyinaa kaa ho.
It will be enough, most likely.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso, ɛda adi kɛse sɛ.
I want to see the front end and the back end.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu anim awiei ne akyi awiei.
Do you have shoes?	So wowɔ mpaboa?
He is sitting in his car.	Ɔte ne kar mu.
So, that makes me dangerous.	Enti, ɛno ma meyɛ asiane.
Not here, not with him.	Ɛnyɛ ha, ɛnyɛ ne nkyɛn.
And so are people.	Na nnipa nso te saa.
Yesterday was amazing.	Nnɛra no yɛ nwonwa.
You can do that while we have you.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa bere a yɛwɔ wo no.
The door that has it.	Ɔpon a ɛwɔ no.
He is used to working outside.	Wayɛ ne su sɛ ɔbɛyɛ adwuma wɔ abɔnten.
But only in one case.	Nanso wɔ tebea biako mu nkutoo.
It doesn’t have to be that way though.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ saa de, nanso.
This is a remarkable statement.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
With music there is no time for anything else.	Nnwom ho no bere nni hɔ ma biribi foforo biara.
It all felt powerful to me.	Ne nyinaa tee nka sɛ ɛwɔ tumi ma me.
I need a face.	Me hia anim.
He feels it’s too soon.	Ɔte nka sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo.
The work was difficult.	Ná adwuma no yɛ den.
But no one lives here anymore.	Nanso obiara nte ha bio.
I look at my hands.	Mehwɛ me nsa.
This part of town is becoming increasingly fashionable.	Kurow no fã yi reyɛ nea aba so kɛse.
You agree with them on things.	Wo ne wɔn yɛ adwene wɔ nneɛma ho.
His head hurt.	Ne ti yɛɛ no ​​yaw.
The game, however, is this.	Nanso, agoru no ne sɛ.
The old town was beautiful.	Ná kurow dedaw no yɛ fɛ.
He seemed so vibrant, full of life.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ hyew yiye, na nkwa ahyɛ no ma.
Mom had a little accident on the street.	Maame nyaa akwanhyia kakra wɔ abɔnten so.
On the water.	Wɔ nsu no so.
That would be too obvious.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nea ɛda adi dodo.
Children should not play in the park.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ mmofra di agoru wɔ abɔnten so.
Forget everything first, just start something completely new.	Wo werɛ mfi biribiara di kan, fi biribi foforo koraa ase kɛkɛ.
You know, almost as simple as that.	Wunim, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ saa.
I still had them.	Ná meda so ara wɔ wɔn.
I still have to work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda so ara yɛ adwuma.
Use it or use it.	Fa di dwuma anaa fa di dwuma.
It’s not really a problem.	Ɛnyɛ ɔhaw ankasa.
He nods, you nod.	Ɔde ne ti to fam, wo de ne ti to fam.
We approach it with music first.	Yɛde nnwom di kan kɔ ho.
But it should be possible.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yiye.
He would do something.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ biribi.
I know what he wants me to say.	Minim nea ɔpɛ sɛ meka.
I’m glad he’s here.	M’ani agye sɛ ɔwɔ ha.
I know, but .	Minim, nanso .
It wasn’t a girl’s room.	Ná ɛnyɛ abeawa bi dan.
I touched it again.	Mede me nsa kaa ho bio.
That was many years ago.	Na ɛyɛ mfe pii a atwam ni.
That seems to be a mistake.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ mfomso.
It’s like this.	Ɛte sɛ eyi.
They were completely shocked.	Wɔ ho dwiriw no koraa.
Many winters ahead.	Awɔw bere pii da yɛn anim.
That was three years ago.	Ɛno yɛ mfe abiɛsa a atwam ni.
No one had to worry about a job.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara haw ne ho wɔ adwuma bi ho.
Many believe he is innocent.	Nnipa pii gye di sɛ ne ho nni asɛm.
There really aren’t many good jobs.	Adwuma pa pii nni hɔ ankasa.
It doesn’t matter much.	Ɛho nhia pii.
Show up on time.	Fa wo ho kyerɛ wɔ bere ano.
I tell myself this was a mistake.	Meka kyerɛ me ho sɛ na eyi yɛ mfomso.
The arrangement was temporary.	Ná nhyehyɛe no yɛ bere tiaa mu de.
But even that takes years.	Nanso ɛno mpo gye mfe pii.
There is much excitement about this.	Anigye pii wɔ eyi ho.
The other team did neither of those things.	Kuw foforo no anyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara.
No one knows exactly why these things happen.	Obiara nnim nea enti a saa nneɛma yi ba no yiye.
We are in the water.	Yɛwɔ nsu no mu.
Usually one or only one wins.	Mpɛn pii no, biako anaa biako pɛ na edi nkonim.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
Remember, it’s true.	Kae sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
The winter was severe.	Ná awɔw bere no mu yɛ den.
So that’s not terrible at all.	Enti ɛno nyɛ hu koraa.
He is also very happy.	Ɔno nso ani gye paa.
She was as beautiful as ever.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ te sɛ kan no.
Let our hair grow long.	Ma yɛn ti nhwi nyɛ tenten.
It is still the same today.	Ɛda so ara te saa nnɛ.
It was bad enough.	Ná ɛyɛ bɔne sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I know what the problem is!	Minim nea ɛyɛ ɔhaw no!
But your life is in danger.	Nanso asiane wɔ wo nkwa mu.
But they seem to like it.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani gye ho.
I can still remember that room.	Meda so ara tumi kae saa dan no.
I know he’s gone too.	Minim sɛ ɔno nso akɔ.
Maybe just a few.	Ebia kakraa bi pɛ.
You were both very nice people.	Ná mo baanu nyinaa yɛ nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
They were fully policed.	Wɔde polisifo yɛɛ adwuma koraa.
Almost happy new year.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ afe foforo mu anigye.
The story of the city.	Kurow no ho asɛm.
But they are not alone.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wɔn nkutoo na wɔyɛ saa.
An animal comes out of his room.	Aboa bi fi ne dan mu ba.
A little bit really.	Kakraa bi ankasa.
It was very exciting.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
That leaves a lot of people out.	Ɛno ma nnipa pii fi mu.
But that’s easy.	Nanso ɛno yɛ mmerɛw.
After a few tries it works.	Wɔ mmɔden kakraa bi akyi no ɛyɛ adwuma.
Describe the results.	Ka aba no ho asɛm.
At the edge of things.	Wɔ nneɛma ano.
I knew where this was going.	Ná minim baabi a eyi rekɔ.
Not that it mattered.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛho hia.
The task was too difficult for him.	Adwuma no yɛɛ den dodo maa no.
You need to know where it is.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu baabi a ɛwɔ.
Happiness is with the good.	Anigye ka papa ho.
Mine are not always so pretty.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na me de no yɛ fɛ saa.
This is a time, a long time ago now.	Eyi yɛ bere a, bere tenten a atwam ni mprempren.
That’s what we do.	Ɛno ne nea yɛyɛ.
It’s just the truth.	Ɛyɛ nokware no ara kwa.
He did a fantastic job too.	Ɔno nso yɛɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
We should do this every year.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ eyi afe biara.
He has some work to do here, anyway.	Ɔwɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ wɔ ha, sɛnea ɛte biara.
Outside the car, the kids play.	Wɔ kar no akyi no, mmofra no di agoru.
He spent the years making money.	Ɔde mfe no yɛɛ sika.
It doesn’t really work.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma ankasa.
The house is just as bad as he is.	Ofie no yɛ bɔne te sɛ ɔno ara pɛ.
It was pretty good.	Ná ɛyɛ papa yiye.
This test is very simple.	Saa sɔhwɛ yi yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
There is nothing.	Biribiara nni hɔ.
I didn’t know a single person.	Ná minnim onipa biako mpo.
No one went there that day.	Obiara ankɔ hɔ saa da no.
I just didn’t know.	Ná minnim kɛkɛ.
This goes in the right direction.	Eyi kɔ ɔkwan pa so.
None of us know what to do.	Yɛn mu biara nnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
The same is true of prices.	Nneɛma bo nso te saa ara.
Currently, there are not many cars.	Mprempren, kar pii nni hɔ.
And he will do so.	Na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
But he wasn’t a kid.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ abofra.
I could run.	Ná metumi atu mmirika.
None of this is true.	Eyi mu biara nyɛ nokware.
I do bad things.	Meyɛ nneɛma bɔne.
All those years.	Saa mfe no nyinaa.
What was there is better.	Nea na ɛwɔ hɔ no, eye sen saa.
In this paper.	Wɔ krataa yi mu.
Do it he did that.	Yɛ no ɔyɛɛ saa.
I couldn’t see him as a client.	Na mintumi nhu no sɛ obi a ɔde ne ho to so.
But only for a short time.	Nanso bere tiaa bi pɛ.
It’s really quite obvious.	Ɛda adi yiye ankasa.
The man believed his wife was unfaithful.	Ná ɔbarima no gye di sɛ ne yere nni nokware.
There is a reason for this.	Ade bi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
Sin leads to sin.	Bɔne de kɔ bɔne mu.
He was in my car.	Ná ɔwɔ me kar mu.
It’s all very difficult.	Ne nyinaa yɛ den yiye.
He seemed to enjoy it.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye ho.
Such a terrible story!	Asɛm a ɛyɛ hu a ɛte saa!
I’m interested in it.	M’ani gye ho.
I think it’s an important part of the team.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ kuw no fã a ɛho hia.
Validate the other person.	Fa onipa foforo no yɛ nokware.
Take time to enjoy all that is here.	Gye bere fa w’ani gye nea ɛwɔ ha nyinaa ho.
No one here understands language.	Obiara nni ha a ɔte kasa ase.
You can do this for me.	Wubetumi ayɛ eyi ama me.
They must be independent and cooperative.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn ho na wɔyɛ biako.
There is no end in sight.	Awiei biara nni hɔ.
No one else seems to do that.	Ɛte sɛ nea obi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ saa.
How can I do that.	Ɔkwan bɛn so na metumi ayɛ saa.
None of us are here by accident.	Yɛn mu biara nni ha wɔ akwanhyia mu.
Even that, really, isn’t easy.	Ɛno mpo, ankasa, nyɛ mmerɛw.
It wasn’t much money.	Na ɛnyɛ sika pii.
I don’t know if that’s a good idea or not.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno yɛ adwene pa anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
I couldn’t find his name.	Na mintumi nhu ne din.
I really feel like we have it then.	Mete nka ankasa sɛ yɛwɔ bi saa bere no.
This new thing, my hand on another man's back.	Saa ade foforo yi, me nsa wɔ ɔbarima foforo akyi.
That’s a no-brainer.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛnyɛ hwee.
But that’s not the same thing.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ ade koro.
We are in here.	Yɛwɔ ha mu.
This new model looks solid.	Saa mfonini foforo yi hwɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den.
He nodded to both of us.	Ɔde ne ti too fam kyerɛɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa.
If you have something to say, keep saying it.	Sɛ wowɔ asɛm bi ka a, kɔ so ka.
The team won quickly.	Kuw no dii nkonim ntɛmntɛm.
That is not always true.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛno yɛ nokware.
I can go the other way.	Metumi akɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
The cost of work was not even available.	Ná adwuma a wɔyɛ ho ka no ntumi nnya mpo.
They got involved.	Wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ mu.
It’s like a snake.	Ɛte sɛ ɔwɔ.
Check out the full schedule below.	Hwɛ nhyehyɛe no nyinaa wɔ ase hɔ.
The music can be here today and gone tomorrow.	Nnwom no betumi aba ha nnɛ na akɔ ɔkyena.
He never wants this.	Ɔmpɛ eyi da.
An error has occurred.	Mfomso bi aba.
He trusted me.	Ɔde ne ho too me so.
And do it.	Na yɛ no.
However, this was not the case at all.	Nanso, na eyi nyɛ saa koraa.
You have to be the best option.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo na woyɛ ɔkwan a eye sen biara.
There was no one there.	Ná obiara nte hɔ.
Talk about a great project.	Ka adwuma kɛse bi a woreyɛ ho asɛm.
I look down at my old shoes.	Mehwɛ me mpaboa dedaw no ase.
But you have to trust me.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho to me so.
I think it’s just great.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa.
In the music as well.	Wɔ nnwom no mu nso.
Check it out below!.	Hwɛ mu wɔ ase ha!.
He’s my dog.	Ɔyɛ me kraman.
Things he doesn’t want any of us to hear about.	Nneɛma a ɔmpɛ sɛ yɛn mu biara te ho asɛm.
And we will do that.	Na yɛbɛyɛ saa.
I just can’t tell you.	Mintumi nka nkyerɛ wo kɛkɛ.
In a short period of time.	Wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
That’s how it’s supposed to work.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
Something is going on.	Biribi rekɔ so.
Water is a limited resource.	Nsu yɛ ade a ɛwɔ hɔ kakraa bi.
However, most people are not so happy.	Nanso, nnipa dodow no ara nni anigye koraa saa.
The stunning ones.	Wɔn a wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa no.
It would be cheaper.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den.
People stare at me.	Nkurɔfo ani so hwɛ me.
Like how hard that can be.	Te sɛ sɛnea ɛno betumi ayɛ den no.
The dog gave the dog a loud bark.	Ɔkraman no maa ɔkraman no bɔɔ mu denneennen.
But that wasn’t good enough.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ papa.
Anything he can tell himself that he did anything.	Biribiara a obetumi aka akyerɛ ne ho sɛ ɔyɛɛ biribiara.
I’d like to do more of that.	M’ani begye ho sɛ mɛyɛ saa pii.
This day is for you to use as you wish.	Saa da yi yɛ ma wo sɛ wode di dwuma sɛnea wopɛ.
That’s how your father got involved.	Saa na wo papa de ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
I’m pretty happy about that.	M’ani agye yiye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
No cars come inside.	Kar biara mma mu.
Check out the group and check out the photos.	Hwɛ kuw no na hwɛ mfonini ahorow no.
Or he put it down.	Anaasɛ ɔde too fam.
More is not always better.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na pii yɛ papa.
It was actually really good fun.	Na ɛyɛ anigye pa ankasa ankasa.
Knowing that has made me even more focused.	Ɛno a minim no ama m’adwene asi biribi so kɛse mpo.
He works with his people.	Ɔne ne nkurɔfo yɛ adwuma.
The police have finally arrived.	Awiei koraa no, polisifo no aba.
He was mostly alone.	Ná ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ kɛse.
Whatever you love, make time for it.	Biribiara a w’ani gye ho no, gye bere ma no.
We do this for two reasons.	Nneɛma abien nti na yɛyɛ eyi.
Nor does any other man.	Saa ara nso na ɔbarima foforo biara.
Might as well do it here.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa saa ara sɛ yɛyɛ saa wɔ ha a.
All your powers.	Wo tumi nyinaa.
They did not need to put up any of their own.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ wɔde wɔn ankasa de biara to hɔ.
He just loved people.	Ná n’ani gye nnipa ho ara kwa.
It seemed like nothing at the time.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ hwee saa bere no.
I've had enough, thank you.	Me nsa aka nea ɛdɔɔso, meda wo ase.
You know him far better than we do.	Wunim no yiye sen yɛn koraa.
He has everything given to him.	Ɔwɔ biribiara a wɔde ama no.
That’s what he told me.	Saa na ɔka kyerɛɛ me.
I couldn’t care less.	Ná mintumi mfa ho.
So he’s probably pretty happy.	Enti ebia n’ani agye yiye.
I’m so happy to have done this job.	M’ani agye yiye sɛ mayɛ adwuma yi.
Look at these pictures.	Hwɛ mfonini ahorow yi.
There are some issues.	Nsɛm bi wɔ hɔ.
You’re not with me.	Wo ne me nka.
There was a police force.	Ná polisifo kuw bi wɔ hɔ.
Good to have you this morning.	Eye sɛ yɛwɔ wo anɔpa yi.
Our house was flooded today.	Nsu hyɛɛ yɛn fie ma nnɛ.
It didn’t matter to him.	Ná ɛnyɛ no asɛm.
I was the only one there.	Ná me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ.
This is not their job.	Eyi nyɛ wɔn adwuma.
Discover new music.	Hu nnwom foforo.
It doesn’t sound bad.	Ɛnte sɛ nea ɛyɛ bɔne.
It was easy.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I hope he knows what he's doing.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ onim nea ɔreyɛ.
So everyone has a right.	Enti obiara wɔ ho kwan.
They are part of this story.	Wɔyɛ saa asɛm yi fã.
That’s the point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no.
What it is.	Nea ɛyɛ.
Keep up to date with current events.	Kɔ so hu nsɛm a ɛrekɔ so mprempren.
He wasn't pretty this time.	Ná ne ho nyɛ fɛ saa bere yi.
An absolutely beautiful day.	Da a ɛyɛ fɛ koraa.
This is very good news for you and for them.	Eyi yɛ nsɛm a eye paa ma wo ne wɔn nso.
I'm not doing it.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ mereyɛ.
He says I like it.	Ɔka sɛ m’ani gye ho.
But it is not the case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte.
He took advantage of this opportunity.	Ɔde hokwan yi dii dwuma.
Towards each other, they are full of virtue.	Wɔ wɔn ho wɔn ho ho no, su pa ahyɛ wɔn ma.
I'm talking about it.	Meka ho asɛm.
You really wanted to do everything right.	Ná wopɛ sɛ woyɛ biribiara yiye ankasa.
The space was gone.	Ná baabi a ɛwɔ hɔ no nni hɔ bio.
Both methods involve the same amount of work.	Ɔkwan abien no nyinaa fa adwuma dodow koro no ara ho.
He was a very efficient man.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ adwuma yiye.
It’s very important.	Ɛho hia paa.
Very good person.	Onipa pa paa.
I'm really sorry, but .	Mepa wo kyɛw ankasa, nanso .
But no one really is.	Nanso obiara nni hɔ a ɔte saa ankasa.
A few days.	Nna kakraa bi.
In one room.	Wɔ dan biako mu.
That is not true at all.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware koraa.
You are beautiful too.	Wo nso wo ho yɛ fɛ.
Walking is good.	Nantew yɛ papa.
If you have friends.	Wowɔ nnamfo a.
He knew her much better.	Ná onim no yiye sen no koraa.
There was nothing in the room.	Ná hwee nni dan no mu.
He works for me.	Ɔyɛ adwuma ma me.
We had a little something to do with it.	Ná yɛwɔ biribi kakra wɔ ho.
It’s really exciting.	Ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
Or pretended not to.	Anaasɛ ɔyɛɛ ne ho sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
It’s not his fault at all.	Ɛnyɛ ne mfomso koraa.
It was a time of hope.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a anidaso wom.
I really like the storytelling.	M’ani gye sɛnea wɔka asɛm no ho ankasa.
Just you and the kids.	Wo ne mmofra no nkutoo.
Be really clear about what you really want.	Ma nea wopɛ ankasa no mu da hɔ ankasa.
He didn’t know himself.	Ná onnim ne ho.
You concluded the story.	Wode asɛm no baa awiei.
To me, that is the most important point.	Wɔ me fam no, ɛno ne asɛm a ɛho hia sen biara.
That is not our job.	Ɛno nyɛ yɛn adwuma.
The same is true of language.	Saa ara na kasa nso te.
Late.	Aka akyi.
Still works happily though.	Da so ara yɛ adwuma anigye so de, nanso.
I couldn’t get inside.	Na mintumi nkɔ mu.
If someone could tell me, that would be great.	Sɛ obi betumi aka akyerɛ me a, ɛno bɛyɛ kɛse.
No one plans their meals.	Obiara nyɛ wɔn aduan ho nhyehyɛe.
I’m in love with him.	M’ani gyee ne ho.
I think it will be too hot.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ hyew dodo.
It wasn’t his fault.	Na ɛnyɛ ne mfomso.
Surprisingly, they both like you.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa no, wɔn baanu nyinaa pɛ wo.
And it will work well.	Na ɛbɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
Most don’t .	Dodow no ara nyɛ saa .
I used to love it.	Kan no na m’ani gye ho.
I became much stronger.	Meyɛɛ den kɛse.
Everything in the story is about control.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ asɛm no mu no fa tumi a wɔde di dwuma ho.
The kids are obviously excited.	Ɛda adi sɛ mmofra no ani agye.
He is the man.	Ɔno ne ɔbarima no.
I didn’t know that.	Ná minnim saa asɛm no.
He wasn’t a bad guy, really.	Na ɔnyɛ obi a ɔyɛ bɔne, ampa.
I’ll love the way it looks.	M’ani begye sɛnea ɛte no ho.
Everyone was working on the one thing.	Ná obiara reyɛ ade biako no ho adwuma.
One more danger.	Asiane biako bio.
Many people have tried.	Nnipa pii abɔ mmɔden.
Poor quality shoes can be very painful.	Mpaboa a ɛnyɛ papa betumi ayɛ yaw kɛse.
Get out of the situation.	Fi tebea no mu.
I know we can do it.	Minim sɛ yebetumi ayɛ.
This will be the last one.	Eyi bɛyɛ nea etwa to.
Use this as a test.	Fa eyi di dwuma sɛ sɔhwɛ.
He always forgets his name.	Ne werɛ fi ne din bere nyinaa.
I got you new stuff.	Me nyaa wo nneɛma foforo.
The mind is important.	Adwene no ho hia.
Everything is going well.	Ne nyinaa rekɔ so yiye.
Give or take a year.	Ma anaa gye afe biako.
It’s certainly not an easy task.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
This should be the year.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ afe no.
As can be seen, this was not true.	Sɛnea yebetumi ahu no, na eyi nyɛ nokware.
However, this doesn’t work.	Nanso, eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
You are so wonderful to me .	Woyɛ nwonwa paa ma me .
You don’t have to do anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribiara.
I loved both the story and the different characters.	M’ani gyee asɛm no ne nnipa ahorow a wɔka ho asɛm no nyinaa ho.
He wants to do that.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
That’s really important to me.	Ɛno ho hia me ankasa.
The clothes were not good.	Ná ntade no nyɛ papa.
But that's probably more my problem than yours.	Nanso ebia ɛno ne me haw kɛse sen wo de no.
I can’t give it to them now.	Mintumi mfa mma wɔn mprempren.
This is a learning project.	Eyi yɛ adesua adwuma.
So price is high.	Enti bo yɛ kɛse.
I really want this one.	Mepɛ eyi ankasa.
He knew he was.	Ná onim sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
He’s just a kid, after all.	Ɔyɛ abofra ara kwa, ne nyinaa akyi no.
Maybe it will be tomorrow.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ ɔkyena.
This works very well.	Eyi yɛ adwuma yiye paa.
You are the best.	Wo na woyɛ papa sen biara.
And the kids were gone.	Na mmofra no nso nni hɔ bio.
So this was the same thing.	Enti na eyi yɛ ade koro no ara.
This actually happened .	Eyi sii ankasa .
That’s pretty hot.	Ɛno yɛ hyew yiye.
You just can’t win.	Worentumi nni nkonim kɛkɛ.
Not every person knows every language.	Ɛnyɛ onipa biara na onim kasa biara.
There are many different types of music.	Nnwom mu nneɛma ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
I love our house.	M’ani gye yɛn fie no ho.
Follow it into the house.	Di akyi kɔ fie hɔ.
I used him a little bit.	Mede no dii dwuma kakra.
I made two paintings.	Meyɛɛ mfonini abien.
It should be easy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Nothing new anymore.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ foforo bio.
This is a common mistake.	Eyi yɛ mfomso a abu so.
There is no one who can help you.	Obiara nni hɔ a obetumi aboa wo.
He uses strong hands for a long time.	Ɔde nsa a ano yɛ den di dwuma bere tenten.
This is your first film.	Eyi ne wo sini a edi kan.
Not all of it, by any means.	Ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa, ɔkwan biara so.
Everything else is as it should be.	Biribiara a aka no te sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
Is he the one.	So ɔno.
Please don’t say one word about this.	Mesrɛ wo, nka asɛm biako mpo mfa eyi ho.
I showed you my letter this evening to prove it.	Mede me krataa no kyerɛɛ wo anwummere yi de akyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
What is his name.	Ne din ne dɛn.
Maybe I didn’t want to know.	Ebia na mempɛ sɛ mihu.
But for me, it’s a different story.	Nanso me fam no, ɛyɛ asɛm foforo.
That was my first thought.	Ɛno ne m’adwene a edi kan no.
Not even the majority.	Ɛnyɛ dodow no ara mpo.
Food was at his side.	Ná aduan wɔ ne nkyɛn.
I felt bad for him.	Metee nka bɔne ma no.
It was something far more important.	Ná ɛyɛ biribi a ɛho hia sen saa koraa.
This was a huge problem.	Ná eyi yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
We are afraid.	Yɛn suro.
I want you to enjoy it.	Mepɛ sɛ mo ani gye ho.
The first time my father hit me was in this house.	Bere a edi kan a me papa bɔɔ me ne ofie yi mu.
Whether you do that.	Sɛ́ ebia woyɛ saa no.
Again, this means planning more often.	Bio nso, eyi kyerɛ sɛ wobɛyɛ nhyehyɛe mpɛn pii.
Best book for the season.	Nhoma a eye sen biara ma bere no.
For most businesses, this is too soon.	Wɔ nnwuma dodow no ara fam no, eyi yɛ ntɛm dodo.
I think it should be helpful for us.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmoa ma yɛn.
And you are one of them.	Na woyɛ wɔn mu biako.
This has happened several times now.	Eyi asi mpɛn pii mprempren.
It just gets better and better.	Ɛyɛ yiye na ɛyɛ yiye ara kwa.
He shouldn't have brought her here.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔde no ba ha.
One has to bring one’s whole self to the task.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi de ne ho nyinaa ba adwuma no mu.
I got on well with him.	Me ne no dii yiye.
The food industry is a different story.	Aduan ho adwuma no yɛ asɛm foforo.
Maybe both in this case.	Ebia abien no nyinaa wɔ asɛm yi mu.
Is that what you know.	So ɛno na wunim.
I knew exactly where everyone was.	Ná minim baabi a obiara wɔ yiye.
I don’t really know how to say it.	Minnim sɛnea mɛka no ankasa.
You’re kind of interested.	W’ani gye ho ɔkwan bi so.
He didn't have to worry.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔhaw ne ho.
Most people are not so lucky.	Nnipa dodow no ara nni anigye saa.
He was quite young.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
We must not forget.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛn werɛ fi.
Give it one last chance.	Ma no hokwan biako a etwa to.
There was no one there.	Ná obiara nni hɔ.
He touched his head with one hand.	Ɔde ne nsa biako kaa ne ti.
Put your foot in the seed.	Fa wo nan to aba.
You are treating me well.	Wo ne me di yiye.
There is something about this picture.	Biribi wɔ saa mfonini yi ho.
I so don't have enough time right now.	Me enti minni bere a ɛdɔɔso mprempren.
There was no time to do anything about it.	Ná bere biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ ho biribi.
His wife believes he is innocent.	Ne yere gye di sɛ ne ho nni asɛm.
This is the idea.	Eyi ne adwene no.
My favorite table was empty.	Ná pon a m’ani gye ho paa no nni hwee.
It’s really exciting.	Ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
But it was something.	Nanso na ɛyɛ biribi.
Money is nothing.	Sika nyɛ ade biara.
But none of these things are true.	Nanso saa nneɛma yi mu biara nyɛ nokware.
My hands can’t reach it.	Me nsa ntumi nkɔ.
But not with him.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɔne no.
Don’t hurt yourself.	Mma wo yaw.
His help was absolutely necessary.	Ná ne mmoa no ho hia koraa.
But we have to take advantage of the opportunity.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde hokwan no di dwuma.
I thought it would be really hard, but it wasn’t.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛbɛyɛ den ankasa, nanso na ɛnte saa.
Another incident occurred.	Asɛm foforo bi sii.
They are good kids.	Wɔyɛ mmofra pa.
He knows her.	Onim no.
Everyone was on the team last year.	Na obiara wɔ kuw no mu afe a etwaam no.
That’s not me anymore.	Ɛno nyɛ me bio.
That was the last of them.	Ɛno ne wɔn mu nea etwa to.
I want to hear what it was, not what it wasn’t.	Mepɛ sɛ mete nea na ɛyɛ, na ɛnyɛ nea na ɛnyɛ.
That surprised me.	Ɛno yɛɛ me nwonwa.
All humans are weak.	Nnipa nyinaa yɛ mmerɛw.
One quick thing though.	Ade biako a ɛyɛ ntɛm de, nanso.
The dog was too quick for him.	Ná ɔkraman no yɛ ntɛm dodo ma no.
But all the details.	Nanso nsɛm no nyinaa.
So do people, too.	Saa ara na nkurɔfo nso yɛ.
And yet not much of one.	Na nanso ɛnyɛ biako pii.
Put your hand down and tell me what’s going on.	Fa wo nsa to fam na ka nea ɛrekɔ so no kyerɛ me.
It may be the same for you.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa ara wɔ wo fam.
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
Again, do this as soon as possible.	Bio nso, yɛ eyi ntɛm ara sɛnea wubetumi.
No one wants to be like that.	Obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔte saa.
I'm a girl.	Meyɛ abeawa.
Like, a lot more.	Te sɛ, pii bio.
It was going on.	Ná ɛrekɔ so.
This is a powerful thing.	Eyi yɛ ade a tumi wom.
At least that’s what he hoped.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne nea na ɔwɔ anidaso.
This was my home.	Ná eyi ne me fie.
Production costs are not high.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ no ho ka nyɛ kɛse.
I just did what needed to be done.	Meyɛɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no ara kwa.
Maybe he would do that.	Ebia na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I only got a couple of them.	Me nsa kaa wɔn mu baanu bi pɛ.
I think a lot of people were.	Misusuw sɛ na nnipa pii yɛ saa.
Is this possible.	So eyi betumi ayɛ yiye.
And, we can give life.	Na, yebetumi ama nkwa.
Man, that’s great.	Onipa, ɛno yɛ kɛse.
He must not be strong in will.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ den wɔ ɔpɛ mu.
He is very short.	Ɔyɛ tiaa paa.
One table contains presentations and the other is the control table.	Nsɛm a wɔka kyerɛ wɔ pon biako so na biako nso yɛ pon a wɔde di dwuma no.
That might be for the best.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
Tomorrow will be just another day for me.	Ɔkyena bɛyɛ da foforo ara kwa ama me.
Perhaps the idea was quite ahead of its time.	Ebia na adwene no di ne bere so koraa.
That doesn’t help us much.	Ɛno mmoa yɛn pii.
He wanted to touch her.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka no.
One day was like another entirely.	Ná da koro bi te sɛ da foforo koraa.
There is a letter on the bed.	Krataa bi da mpa no so.
When you are good at something, you put in it.	Sɛ wo ho akokwaw wɔ biribi mu a, wode wo ho hyɛ mu.
He’s a movie, but he’s a real person.	Ɔyɛ sini, nanso ɔyɛ obi ankasa.
He organized the whole study.	Ɔyɛɛ adesua no nyinaa ho nhyehyɛe.
I understand this is his first book.	Mete ase sɛ eyi ne ne nhoma a edi kan.
None of this is true.	Eyi mu biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nokware.
It feels so amazing when a song can do that.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye bere a dwom bi tumi yɛ saa no.
I couldn’t use him.	Na mintumi mfa no nni dwuma.
But this is the last chance.	Nanso eyi ne hokwan a etwa to.
But it does exist.	Nanso ɛwɔ hɔ.
See what you can find.	Hwɛ nea wubetumi ahu.
It’s not that bad.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne saa.
He wasn’t a bad person or anything.	Na ɔnyɛ onipa bɔne anaa biribiara.
I would take a walk to the back.	Ná mede nantew bi bɛkɔ akyi.
Take it into her.	Fa no kɔ ne mu.
I can be there for you.	Metumi ayɛ hɔ ama wo.
We use the bus in the city.	Yɛde bɔs di dwuma wɔ kurow no mu.
He would go with you.	Ná ɔne wo bɛkɔ.
This applies to you and me as well.	Eyi fa me ne wo nso ho.
I can’t seem to do anything.	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nyɛ hwee.
I know you.	Minim wo.
Something isn’t working.	Biribi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
You know this, this is old hat for everybody now.	Wunim eyi, eyi yɛ kyɛw dedaw ma obiara mprempren.
The anticipation also surged through me.	Anidaso no nso faa me so yɛɛ kɛse.
Someone did, that’s for sure.	Obi yɛɛ saa, ɛno yɛ nokware.
Instead of being one.	Nea anka ɛbɛyɛ biako.
I feed them with them.	Mede wɔn di aduan.
The information looks like it could easily be.	Nsɛm no hwɛ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ.
Scary, terribly exciting, all of it.	Ɛyɛ hu, anigye a ɛyɛ hu, ne nyinaa.
The outer way doesn't work either.	Ɔkwan a ɛwɔ akyi no nso ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
Money means nothing to us.	Sika nkyerɛ hwee mma yɛn.
The first month is the same.	Ɔsram a edi kan no yɛ saa ara.
He parked the car in reverse.	Ɔde kar no sii akyi.
That’s typical of a lot of the people who work here.	Ɛno yɛ nnipa a wɔyɛ adwuma wɔ ha no mu pii su.
It’s on the house for you.	Ɛwɔ fie no so ma wo.
So they all set out on their long journey.	Enti wɔn nyinaa sii wɔn kwan tenten no so.
The most authentic.	Nea ɛyɛ nokware sen biara.
We would do it again.	Anka yɛbɛyɛ bio.
But sleep never came.	Nanso nna amma da.
However, I couldn’t quite tell him that.	Nanso, na mintumi nka saa nkyerɛ no yiye.
About the work.	Adwuma no ho.
He must have done so.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
It wasn’t necessary.	Ná ɛho nhia biara.
It is not an excuse.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm a wɔde yi wɔn ho ano.
Show that you can get the job done.	Kyerɛ sɛ wubetumi ama adwuma no ayɛ yiye.
But you know what happened.	Nanso wunim nea esii.
Which should only be used for good.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma ma papa nkutoo.
Not just what he did.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɔyɛɛ no ​​nkutoo.
Great work here.	Adwuma kɛse wɔ ha.
The rest is still in me.	Nea aka no da so ara wɔ me mu.
You are beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ.
It’s not a problem.	Ɛnyɛ ɔhaw.
Check out the results below.	Hwɛ nea afi mu aba wɔ ase hɔ.
Hope until the end.	Anidaso kosi awiei.
Play with the kids.	Wo ne mmofra no nni agoru.
I don’t know if that’s such a good idea.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno yɛ adwene pa a ɛte saa anaa.
Use your head.	Fa wo ti di dwuma.
He has to do whether he likes it or not.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ sɛ n’ani gye ho anaasɛ ɔmpɛ.
There was nothing he would love more.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a n’ani begye ho sen saa.
All of you old ones.	Mo dedaw nyinaa.
And no one has it.	Na obiara nni hɔ a ɔwɔ.
This didn’t matter.	Eyi anyɛ hwee.
This is a good news.	Eyi yɛ asɛm pa.
And if you think you are only one, you will be one.	Na sɛ wususuw sɛ woyɛ biako pɛ a, wobɛyɛ biako.
I'm afraid of you.	Me suro wo.
He put his hand there, under her arm.	Ɔde ne nsa too hɔ, wɔ ne nsa ase.
I've started the thing.	Mede ade no ahyɛ ase.
He was a beautiful man.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
This is really too bad.	Eyi yɛ bɔne dodo ankasa.
Something was still missing.	Ná biribi da so ara nka ho.
I'm sure you were beautiful.	Migye di sɛ na wo ho yɛ fɛ.
And in the background, behind both of them .	Na wɔ akyi, wɔn baanu nyinaa akyi .
Clearly, he wasn’t in it for the money.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛnyɛ sika no nti na ɔwɔ mu.
And there was his bed.	Na ne mpa nso wɔ hɔ.
He too began to sing.	Ɔno nso fii ase too dwom.
Be a part of this!.	Yɛ eyi fã!.
The problem remains.	Ɔhaw no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
But it seems too simple.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
I love the picture of it on the cover.	M’ani gye ne mfonini a ɛwɔ anim no ho.
At the end of the day.	Wɔ da no awiei.
But is he really innocent?	Nanso so ne ho nni asɛm ampa?
I love making movies.	M’ani gye sini a mɛyɛ ho.
You never want anything else.	Wompɛ biribi foforo biara da.
Just like last week.	Ɛte sɛ dapɛn a etwaam no ara pɛ.
The man looked at her.	Ɔbarima no hwɛɛ no.
Only one person did this.	Onipa biako pɛ na ɔyɛɛ eyi.
Doing this a couple of times will get easier.	Sɛ woyɛ eyi mpɛn abien a, ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
They were all alive.	Ná wɔn nyinaa te ase.
I was on one recently.	Ná mewɔ biako so nnansa yi ara.
He absolutely has to.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa koraa.
The music was fantastic.	Ná nnwom no yɛ nwonwa.
But that, too, was beautiful.	Nanso ɛno nso, na ɛyɛ fɛ.
In the winter it didn’t matter.	Wɔ awɔw bere mu no na ɛnyɛ hwee.
But the situation here is more complicated.	Nanso tebea a ɛwɔ ha no mu yɛ den kɛse.
It’s worse than before.	Ɛyɛ bɔne sen kan no.
Things were moving pretty fast now.	Ná nneɛma rekɔ so ntɛmntɛm yiye mprempren.
So that shouldn’t have been included in this one.	Enti na ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde ɛno ka eyi ho.
He didn't want to be touched.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa ka no.
He wasn’t a fan at all.	Na ɔnyɛ obi a ɔpɛ nneɛma koraa.
He was completely present.	Ná ɔte hɔ koraa.
But this is not the time.	Nanso eyi nyɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I can’t sleep.	Mintumi nna.
He obviously didn’t have much.	Ɛda adi sɛ na onni nneɛma pii.
Their test was much easier than ours.	Ná wɔn sɔhwɛ no yɛ mmerɛw koraa sen yɛn de no.
The dog saw a cat.	Ɔkraman no huu ɔkraman bi.
It was a really good story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm pa ankasa.
It was a performance.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a wɔyɛ.
I made up my mind.	Meyɛɛ m’adwene.
It works well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
And there were a lot of cars.	Na kar pii nso ka ho.
You have to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no.
People just don’t like what he has to say.	Nkurɔfo ani nnye nea ɔwɔ ka ho ara kwa.
However, it was sleep.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ nna.
The trailer must have been full.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na kar a wɔde fa nnipa no ayɛ ma.
What is his person?	Dɛn ne ne onipa?
I have done my best.	Mayɛ nea metumi biara.
That was a big moment for me.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere kɛse ma me.
I love movies and music.	M’ani gye sini ne nnwom ho.
This will be the same.	Eyi nso bɛyɛ saa.
Whatever it is, don’t tell me.	Nea ɛyɛ biara no, nka nkyerɛ me.
But that’s all in a way.	Nanso ɛno nyinaa yɛ ɔkwan bi so.
Where does the information come from?	Ɛhe na nsɛm no fi?
Maybe next summer?.	Ebia awɔw bere a edi hɔ no?.
They spoke his language.	Ná wɔka ne kasa.
But it’s not happening.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so.
That girl is me.	Saa abeawa no ne me.
He has the best job in town.	Ɔwɔ adwuma a eye sen biara wɔ kurow no mu.
Take the book with you.	Fa nhoma no ka wo ho.
It’s too hard that way.	Ɛyɛ den dodo saa kwan no so.
So this seems to be the problem.	Enti ɛte sɛ nea eyi ne ɔhaw no.
Winter is our season.	Awɔw bere yɛ yɛn bere.
It’s very good.	Ɛyɛ papa paa.
It was a lot of what we had at that point.	Na ɛyɛ pii a na yɛwɔ saa bere no mu.
I have a lot of it.	Mewɔ pii.
There was nothing else we could do.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ.
You probably know why.	Ebia wunim nea enti a ɛte saa.
It was too cold.	Ná awɔw wom dodo.
There is no doubt about that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
This was troubling me.	Ná eyi haw me.
Something big is going down there.	Biribi kɛse bi rekɔ fam wɔ hɔ.
And maybe that’s my fault.	Na ebia ɛno ne me mfomso.
I don't know what's going on.	Me nnim nea ɛrekɔ so.
Use what you like.	Fa nea w’ani gye ho di dwuma.
It’s just as simple as well.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa ara nso.
There is nothing about me.	Me ho asɛm biara nni hɔ.
Where was he supposed to be.	Ɛhe na na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I was in it.	Ná mewɔ mu.
I thought he was really nice.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
My mother was tall and beautiful.	Ná me maame tenten na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He thought about himself.	Osusuw ne ho.
This is something you are doing for you.	Eyi yɛ biribi a woreyɛ ama wo.
I just knew it.	Ná minim ara kwa.
Maybe along the way.	Ebia wɔ ɔkwan no so.
That rules out almost every other species except humans.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ma mmoa ahorow foforo biara fi hɔ gye nnipa nkutoo.
I wanted to get in without any other problems.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ mu a ɔhaw foforo biara nni ho.
You don’t like the job.	W’ani nnye adwuma no ho.
I thought we were lucky.	Misusuwii sɛ yɛwɔ anigye.
That’s right, he did.	Ɛte saa, ɔyɛɛ saa.
Most couldn’t.	Dodow no ara antumi.
His mind was elsewhere.	Ná n’adwene wɔ baabi foforo.
I think less is better.	Misusuw sɛ kakraa bi ne pii na eye sen biara.
He had a big mouth.	Ná ɔwɔ ano kɛse.
So it’s both self and self-nature.	Enti ɛyɛ ankasa ne ankasa su nyinaa.
One year was like another.	Ná afe biako te sɛ afe foforo.
Any ideas would be appreciated.	Anka yɛn ani begye adwene biara ho.
He could easily prove it.	Ná ɛnyɛ den sɛ obetumi akyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
The house needs new windows.	Ofie no hia mfɛnsere foforo.
However, most users don’t need anything you can offer.	Nanso, wɔn a wɔde di dwuma no mu dodow no ara nhia biribiara a wubetumi de ama.
The first day of school.	Sukuu da a edi kan.
But he wasn’t here.	Nanso na onni ha.
The street is deserted.	Abɔnten so no yɛ nea obiara nni hɔ.
This city has many jobs.	Kurow yi wɔ nnwuma pii.
Maybe more than that.	Ebia pii sen saa.
What do you ever want to say about that?	Dɛn na wopɛ sɛ woka wɔ saa asɛm no ho da?
But, I don’t like him.	Nanso, mempɛ no.
He doesn’t know what he’s doing.	Onnim nea ɔreyɛ.
That is the point of this article.	Ɛno ne asɛm yi mu asɛm.
It’s a good one.	Ɛyɛ papa.
That person sounds familiar to me.	Saa onipa no te sɛ nea minim no yiye.
But those who do.	Nanso wɔn a wɔyɛ saa no.
There was a lot of excitement about it.	Na anigye kɛse wɔ ho.
It was cold.	Ná awɔw wom.
But this is also important.	Nanso eyi nso ho hia.
He had no head or legs.	Ná onni ti anaa ne nan biara.
And this new time too.	Na saa bere foforo yi nso.
One way or another.	Ɔkwan bi so anaa ɔkwan foforo so.
The classes were intense.	Ná adesua ahorow no mu yɛ den.
The project seemed impossible at the time.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea adwuma no ntumi nyɛ yiye saa bere no.
But he knows it’s early.	Nanso onim sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛm.
Not that there is anything wrong with that.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ mfomso biara wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
He had something to tell me.	Ná ɔwɔ biribi a ɔbɛka akyerɛ me.
Their support is also great.	Wɔn mmoa no nso yɛ kɛse.
He was amazing.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa.
I can’t believe it.	Mintumi nnye nni.
His hands stroked my hair.	Ne nsa bɔɔ me ti nhwi.
That will come next week.	Ɛno bɛba dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
As if everything was beautiful.	Te sɛ nea na biribiara yɛ fɛ.
When it was us.	Bere a na ɛyɛ yɛn.
So it’s just me.	Enti ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
I need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
But his time is up.	Nanso ne bere atwam.
The system is far from perfect but it works.	Nhyehyɛe no nyɛ pɛ koraa nanso ɛyɛ adwuma.
He’s a good dog.	Ɔyɛ ɔkraman pa.
He doesn’t want to give his life for that.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde ne nkwa bɛma saa.
He showed the child a picture book.	Ɔde mfonini nhoma bi kyerɛɛ abofra no.
You are beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ.
I loved it, as did he.	M’ani gyee ho, sɛnea ɔno nso ani gyee ho.
That makes this even worse.	Ɛno ma eyi yɛ kɛse mpo.
See how it works.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma.
Things are not what they once were.	Nneɛma nte sɛnea na ɛte bere bi no.
We can see when we are under his control.	Yebetumi ahu bere a yɛwɔ ne tumi ase.
So long ago .	Enti bere tenten a atwam ni .
I feel bad.	Mete nka bɔne.
He didn't really know what he wanted to do next.	Ná onnim nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ akyi no ankasa.
The child ran to his mother.	Abofra no de mmirika kɔɔ ne maame nkyɛn.
It’s not ‘us’ or ‘them’.	Ɛnyɛ ‘yɛn’ anaa ‘wɔn’.
So they are way, way, down.	Enti wɔyɛ kwan, kwan, fam.
It looks nice, it looks nice.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ, ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
There is plenty of help for everyone.	Mmoa pii wɔ hɔ ma obiara.
What you just said is really interesting.	Nea wokae seesei ara no yɛ anigye ankasa.
I know what my problem is.	Minim nea me haw no yɛ.
So, two things have to happen.	Enti, ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma abien ba.
The ending was incredibly powerful.	Ná awiei no wɔ tumi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
All of this led me to this project.	Eyi nyinaa de me baa saa adwuma yi mu.
Maybe that was their problem.	Ebia na ɛno ne wɔn haw.
He knew he was in danger.	Ná onim sɛ ɔwɔ asiane mu.
We all wish it wasn’t.	Yɛn nyinaa yam a anka ɛnte saa.
For the better, obviously.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a eye no, ɛda adi sɛ.
Many people are obviously unaware of this.	Ɛda adi sɛ nnipa pii nnim eyi ho asɛm.
My mother.	Mma nna.
Stay here now.	Tra ha mprempren.
Things are easy.	Nneɛma yɛ mmerɛw.
But this is not what this is.	Nanso ɛnyɛ eyi ne nea eyi te.
The whole situation was incredibly frightening.	Ná tebea no nyinaa yɛ hu ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I look outside.	Mehwɛ abɔnten.
It would have worked.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
We hope you enjoy it.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho.
She's a girl, by the way.	Ɔyɛ abeawa, ɔkwan bi so no.
That’s the way it is.	Saa na ɛte.
Not so fast.	Ɛnyɛ ntɛmntɛm saa.
That dog is gone.	Saa ɔkraman no nni hɔ bio.
It is for informational purposes only.	Ɛyɛ nsɛm a wɔde bɛma nkutoo.
We really enjoyed it.	Yɛn ani gyee ho paa.
You should never be touched.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa ka wo da.
It was a long time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tenten bi.
It’s the only thing that matters.	Ɛyɛ ade biako pɛ a ɛho hia.
Nothing here for me now.	Biribiara nni ha mma me mprempren.
However, the people seem to like it.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea nkurɔfo no ani gye ho.
There had to be another way.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan foforo bi wɔ hɔ.
What he knew.	Nea na onim.
But don’t take my word for it.	Nanso mfa me nsɛm nka wɔ eyi ho.
And I'm good for you.	Na meyɛ papa ma wo.
It is accurate and efficient.	Ɛyɛ nea edi mu na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
He nods at me.	Ɔde ne ti to fam kyerɛ me.
There are many now.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ mprempren.
Go home.	Kɔ fie.
He had an idea that he was doing something.	Ná ɔwɔ adwene bi sɛ ɔreyɛ biribi.
It is a dangerous situation for them.	Ɛyɛ tebea a asiane wom ma wɔn.
He pointed to her for the last time.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ no ​​nea etwa to.
Does that mean that.	So ɛno kyerɛ sɛ.
He didn’t like that idea.	Ná n’ani nnye saa adwene no ho.
This is just a happy accident.	Eyi yɛ akwanhyia a ɛyɛ anigye ara kwa.
I think that’s a great thing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ ade kɛse.
He feels what he feels.	Ɔte nea ɔte nka no nka.
That’s why he was there.	Ɛno nti na na ɔwɔ hɔ no.
The cars are parked here.	Wɔde kar ahorow no asi ha.
This is a work in progress.	Eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛrekɔ so.
No shoes, and again.	Mpaboa biara nni hɔ, na bio nso.
The three dimensions.	Nneɛma abiɛsa a ɛwɔ hɔ no.
Good nutrition is always important.	Aduan pa ho hia bere nyinaa.
His eyes are still on the ground.	N’ani da so ara wɔ fam.
But this is not the case.	Nanso eyi nte saa.
There are so many things to do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
I can’t imagine it at all.	Mintumi nsusuw ho koraa.
I was troubled by the situation.	Ná tebea no haw me.
He thought for a moment about what to do.	Osusuw nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ho kakra.
I'm happy for you.	M'ani agye ma wo.
This is a big moment for me.	Eyi yɛ bere kɛse ma me.
It was the best way.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔkwan a eye sen biara.
Why did we get wet?	Dɛn nti na yɛn ho yɛɛ nsu?
It’s not that late.	Ɛnyɛ nea aka akyi saa.
This takes too long.	Eyi gye bere tenten dodo.
We can’t do it anymore.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ bio.
That can mean anything that seems terrible to us.	Ɛno betumi akyerɛ biribiara a ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu ma yɛn.
That was not the plan.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no.
What language do you speak?	Kasa bɛn na woka?
Usually an extra filler is provided.	Mpɛn pii no, wɔde biribi foforo a wɔde hyɛ mu ma.
Good in the mind.	Eye wɔ adwene mu.
I might drive past later.	Ebia mɛka kar atwam akyiri yi.
It’s not new to me.	Ɛnyɛ ade foforo mma me.
That was terrifying.	Ná ɛno yɛ hu yiye.
So that’s what we’ve been playing with a lot now.	Enti ɛno ne nea yɛde adi agoru pii mprempren.
At least this was something.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na eyi yɛ biribi.
I lived with my father.	Ná me ne me papa te.
He wasn’t interested.	Ná n’ani nnye ho.
Keep revealing it.	Kɔ so da no adi.
However, he was relieved.	Nanso, ne ho tɔɔ no.
It’s not great.	Ɛnyɛ kɛse.
Most of the townspeople had money.	Ná kurow no mu nnipa dodow no ara wɔ sika.
So we use their method.	Enti yɛde wɔn kwan no di dwuma.
And you can get them.	Na wubetumi anya wɔn.
I am also a minority.	Me nso meyɛ kakraa bi.
So, it’s very good.	Enti, eye paa.
This might be interesting.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ anigye.
Please give him the book.	Mesrɛ wo, fa nhoma no ma no.
There is something you should probably know.	Biribi wɔ hɔ a ebia ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
Beds are really nice.	Mpa so yɛ fɛ ankasa.
So that will be a big test.	Enti ɛno bɛyɛ sɔhwɛ kɛse.
We brought him into our arms.	Yɛde no baa yɛn nsa so.
So that’s what he does.	Enti ɛno ne nea ɔyɛ.
It’s his easy job.	Ɛyɛ ne adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
But it doesn’t work tonight.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma anadwo yi.
He slipped into it.	Ɔde ne ho too so.
Each of them did.	Wɔn mu biara yɛɛ saa.
It always seems more like that.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa kɛse bere nyinaa.
He didn't even have to try.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden mpo.
I felt it.	Metee nka.
I cannot thank you enough for this.	Mintumi nna mo ase sɛnea ɛsɛ wɔ eyi ho.
They should not be too involved.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu dodo.
They are with me.	Wɔka me ho.
Have fun and tell me what you think.	Gye w’ani na ka nea wususuw kyerɛ me.
These animals are endangered.	Saa mmoa yi wɔ asiane mu.
He had a lot of things to do.	Ná ɔwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
This completely surprised him.	Eyi maa ne ho dwiriw no koraa.
However, he had a job to do, and he did.	Nanso, na ɔwɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ, na ɔyɛɛ saa.
The same can be said here.	Yebetumi aka saa ara wɔ ha.
I don’t want you to think less of me.	Mempɛ sɛ wususuw me ho kakraa bi.
The music is the language.	Nnwom no na ɛyɛ kasa no.
I hope he continues to do so.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔbɛkɔ so ayɛ saa.
I just did it.	Meyɛɛ no ​​ara kwa.
That’s why winter is hard for them.	Ɛno nti na awɔw bere mu yɛ den ma wɔn no.
Just not realistic.	Kɛkɛ a ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
I was unaware of his plans.	Ná minnim ne nhyehyɛe ahorow no.
All the other kids got to play.	Mmofra a aka no nyinaa nyaa kwan dii agoru.
I recognize him then very well.	Mihu no saa bere no yiye.
But many may not know.	Nanso ebia pii nnim.
One night, my father led her out of the house.	Anadwo bi, me papa dii no anim fii fie hɔ.
No doubt you know.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wunim.
So much of this.	Enti eyi pii.
I have to make a plan.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nhyehyɛe.
You need to act quickly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho biribi ntɛm.
This has two consequences.	Eyi de nneɛma abien fi mu ba.
I had never thought about that.	Ná minsusuw saa asɛm no ho da.
That was part of it, but not the whole thing.	Ná ɛno yɛ ne fã, nanso na ɛnyɛ ade mũ no nyinaa.
They were all shocked.	Wɔn nyinaa ho dwiriw wɔn.
I used it a lot.	Mede dii dwuma kɛse.
We have a lot of time.	Yɛwɔ bere pii.
Do what you love, and do it often.	Yɛ nea w’ani gye ho, na yɛ no mpɛn pii.
It’s not going away.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛrekɔ.
And that had been it.	Na na ɛno ayɛ saa.
He runs it anyway.	Ɔde mmirika no ɔkwan biara so.
They work on it.	Wɔyɛ ho adwuma.
It wasn’t the sun.	Ná ɛnyɛ awia.
I saw him every day.	Ná mihu no da biara da.
I can do anything.	Metumi ayɛ biribiara.
It was hard, not a great deal of time.	Ná ɛyɛ den, na ɛnyɛ bere kɛse.
I can see these things being really true for you.	Metumi ahu sɛ saa nneɛma yi yɛ nokware ankasa ma wo.
His words flew out.	Ne nsɛm no tu fii adi.
That says something.	Ɛno ka biribi.
You can tell me later.	Wubetumi aka akyerɛ me akyiri yi.
I want something else.	Mepɛ biribi foforo.
Think about the time.	Susuw bere no ho hwɛ.
That’s really great.	Ɛno yɛ kɛse ankasa.
I see it in his eyes every day.	Mihu no wɔ n’ani so da biara da.
It’s not enough.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
There were no people on the road.	Ná nnipa nni ɔkwan no so.
That means work, work, and more work.	Ɛno kyerɛ adwuma, adwuma, ne adwuma pii.
It’s just a matter of time.	Ɛyɛ bere ho asɛm ara kwa.
Otherwise, it was very difficult.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, na ɛyɛ den yiye.
That does make you stronger.	Ɛno ma woyɛ den ampa.
I don't really have an idea.	Minni adwene bi ankasa.
His wife is even worse.	Ne yere bɔne sen saa mpo.
But that was some time left.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ bere bi a aka.
But it is not true.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nokware.
Consider what he can do with three things.	Susuw nea obetumi de nneɛma abiɛsa ayɛ ho hwɛ.
And, indeed it is.	Na, ampa ara se ɛte saa.
Keep a close eye on everything the team does.	Hwɛ ade biara a kuw no yɛ no yiye.
The terrible day had come and gone.	Ná da a ɛyɛ hu no aba na akɔ.
And obviously, it’s a lot harder than this.	Na ɛda adi sɛ, ɛyɛ den kɛse sen eyi.
In the new one.	Wɔ foforo no mu.
I don’t think this is the case.	Minsusuw sɛ eyi te saa.
His speech was unreal.	Ná ne kasa no yɛ nea ɛnyɛ nokware.
The police didn’t tell us.	Polisifo no anka ankyerɛ yɛn.
It seems that.	Ɛte sɛ nea.
He doesn’t have to say anything.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɔka biribiara.
And that’s where everything goes wrong.	Na ɛno ne baabi a biribiara nkɔ yiye.
A group meeting.	Kuw nhyiam bi.
That’s not surprising.	Ɛno nyɛ nwonwa.
It is much better to work alone today.	Ɛyɛ papa kɛse sɛ wo nkutoo bɛyɛ adwuma nnɛ.
He wanted much, much more.	Ná ɔpɛ pii, pii sen saa.
The same is true now.	Saa ara na ɛte mprempren.
However, fake news is not a recent phenomenon.	Nanso, atoro nsɛm nyɛ ade a aba nnansa yi.
For a few hours, he forgot about his problems.	Nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi no, ne werɛ fii ne haw ahorow no.
I only have the first thing only.	Mewɔ ade a edi kan nkutoo nkutoo.
This will be the final chapter.	Eyi bɛyɛ ti a etwa to.
Nothing is good.	Biribiara nyɛ papa.
It was difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den.
And he tells you.	Na ɔka kyerɛ wo.
I have terrible news.	Mewɔ nsɛm a ɛyɛ hu.
It should have been implemented immediately.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma ntɛm ara.
His hands were numb and weak.	Ná ne nsa ayɛ mmerɛw na na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Maybe a little more.	Ebia kakra bi aka ho.
This is as simple as it gets.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛte no.
A door leads to an inner room.	Ɔpon bi kɔ dan bi a ɛwɔ mu mu.
There was nothing left but the truth.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a aka gye nokware no.
Her clothes were equally impressive.	Ná ne ntade nso yɛ nwonwa saa ara.
Pack a lunch and some water.	Fa awia aduan ne nsu bi hyɛ mu.
However, I knew better than to talk about it in school.	Nanso, na minim yiye sen sɛ mɛka ho asɛm wɔ sukuu mu.
She showed him the two shirts.	Ɔde ntade abien no kyerɛɛ no.
That’s right, there are several of them.	Ɛte saa, wɔn mu dodow bi wɔ hɔ.
Yes, in a short time.	Ampa, bere tiaa bi mu.
Policymaking was not.	Ná nhyehyɛe a wɔyɛ no nyɛ saa.
He knew her name.	Ná onim ne din.
Use some as well.	Fa bi nso di dwuma.
I'm really sorry.	Mepa wo kyɛw ankasa.
Most businesses in the city were affected.	Nnwuma dodow no ara a ɛwɔ kurow no mu no kaa wɔn.
Something really great about that.	Biribi kɛse ankasa wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
But each one has something to say about himself.	Nanso wɔn mu biara wɔ biribi ka fa ne ho.
You don’t want to work there anyway.	Wompɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ ɔkwan biara so.
That was my only truth.	Ná ɛno nkutoo ne me nokware.
So it still does.	Enti ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
He lived alone with his dog.	Ná ɔne ne kraman nkutoo na ɛte.
It’s an old phone.	Ɛyɛ telefon dedaw bi.
I always think of him as just another person.	Bere nyinaa misusuw ne ho sɛ onipa foforo ara kwa.
We enjoyed it.	Yɛn ani gyee ho.
The study consisted of two parts.	Ná adesua no yɛ nneɛma abien.
Here’s what’s interesting.	Nea ɛyɛ anigye ni.
There is little food left.	Aduan kakraa bi na aka.
Never take them for granted.	Mfa wɔn nyɛ hwee da.
Think about that for a moment.	Susuw saa asɛm no ho kakra.
This can take hours.	Eyi betumi agye nnɔnhwerew pii.
I introduce him to a lot of interesting people.	Mede no kyerɛ nnipa pii a wɔn ho yɛ anigye.
He shouldn’t be worried.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔhaw ne ho.
It was very scary.	Ná ɛyɛ hu yiye.
This is not something everyone should want.	Eyi nyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ obiara pɛ.
This is obviously not the case.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nte saa.
Thank you so much!.	Meda wo ase pa ara!.
He worked long hours.	Ná ɔyɛ adwuma nnɔnhwerew pii.
It is important to know when to offer help.	Ɛho hia sɛ wuhu bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wode mmoa ma.
If he has one.	Sɛ ɔwɔ bi a.
What it is.	Nea ɛyɛ.
I never agreed with him on that.	Me ne no anyɛ adwene wɔ saa asɛm no ho da.
To make it worse it actually quite enjoyed itself.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛbɛyɛ bɔne kɛse no ankasa ani gyee ho yiye.
Artificial intelligence is artificial intelligence.	Nyansa a wɔde ayɛ nneɛma yɛ nyansa a wɔde ayɛ nneɛma.
Someone, you tell yourself.	Obi, woka kyerɛ wo ho.
The information we received was incomplete.	Ná nsɛm a yɛn nsa kaa no nni mũ.
Pay close attention to the problems of the day.	Hwɛ da no mu ɔhaw ahorow no yiye.
It was something else.	Ná ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
That was a few years ago.	Ná ɛyɛ mfe kakraa bi a atwam ni.
He seemed to like her, he was a boy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye ne ho, na ɔyɛ abarimaa.
It had been a while since his last use.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi fi bere a etwa to a ɔde dii dwuma no.
When was it?	Bere bɛn na na ɛyɛ?
She asked after her friends with great interest.	Ɔde anigye kɛse bisaa ne nnamfo akyi.
But he enjoyed it.	Nanso n’ani gyee ho.
Keep up the amazing work.	Kɔ so yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa no.
What will he do next?.	Dɛn na ɔbɛyɛ akyi?.
Towards.	Biribi so.
It has been an easy day.	Ayɛ da a ɛnyɛ den.
It’s just one day.	Ɛyɛ da koro pɛ.
Animals react to him.	Mmoa yɛ wɔn ade wɔ ne ho.
He knew what it was.	Ná onim nea ɛyɛ.
The two cases are identical.	Nsɛm abien no yɛ pɛ.
Absenteeism is treated more here.	Wɔyɛ obi a obi ntumi nkɔ sukuu no ho dwuma kɛse wɔ ha.
This was also nothing unusual.	Ná eyi nso nyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It didn’t matter much, though, in the end.	Nanso, na ɛho nhia pii, awiei koraa no.
This is not the case.	Eyi nyɛ saa.
Every animal and every day.	Aboa biara ne da biara.
But we have something better.	Nanso yɛwɔ nea eye sen saa.
Also see if you can handle the task.	Hwɛ nso sɛ wubetumi adi adwuma no ho dwuma anaa.
Everything is fine.	Biribiara ayɛ yiye.
It was dangerous at the time.	Ná ɛyɛ asiane saa bere no.
It would be his last season on the job.	Ná ɛbɛyɛ ne bere a etwa to a ɔde yɛ adwuma no.
He was very happy.	Ná n’ani gye paa.
But you do that.	Nanso woyɛ saa.
It was a busy night.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo a adagyew nnim.
even for me.	mpo ma me.
One is not too good.	Biako nyɛ papa dodo.
The testing phase began the next day.	Sɔhwɛ no fã no fii ase da a edi hɔ no.
You should have known!	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu!
You can make it as interesting as you want.	Wubetumi ama ayɛ anigye sɛnea wopɛ.
You can literally see everything.	Wubetumi ahu biribiara ankasa.
However, it wasn’t.	Nanso, na ɛte saa.
Could he have done more?	So anka obetumi ayɛ pii?
This is really painful.	Eyi yɛ yaw ankasa.
Make sure he’s happy.	Hwɛ sɛ n’ani agye.
But it wasn’t easy.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
It’s not hard for him.	Ɛnyɛ den mma no.
Often, this was not true.	Mpɛn pii no, na eyi nyɛ nokware.
Every bed is full.	Mpa biara so ayɛ ma.
So he was new here, and nobody noticed that.	Enti na ɔyɛ foforo wɔ ha, na obiara anhu saa.
You are part of this.	Woyɛ eyi fã.
While that’s true, it doesn’t matter much.	Bere a ɛno yɛ nokware no, ɛho nhia kɛse.
When I have to go.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
Most people believe he is innocent.	Nnipa dodow no ara gye di sɛ ne ho nni asɛm.
I didn’t know things any other way.	Ná minnim nneɛma ɔkwan foforo biara so.
I just knew the old stuff.	Ná minim nneɛma dedaw no ara kwa.
He is the only one there.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
I look forward to good things.	Mehwɛ nneɛma pa kwan.
I am about as much as I can.	Meyɛ nea metumi biara ho asɛm.
Maybe I still have it.	Ebia meda so ara wɔ bi.
He had done it for her.	Ná wayɛ ama no.
This isn’t me, obviously.	Eyi nyɛ me, ɛda adi sɛ.
It’s really not very easy to say.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw koraa ankasa sɛ wobɛka.
I don't know.	Minnim.
Make it bigger.	Ma ɛnyɛ kɛse.
People are interested in it.	Nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
I can’t do that.	Mintumi nyɛ saa.
There is some hope that it will eventually work.	Anidaso bi wɔ hɔ sɛ awiei koraa no ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
In paper form.	Wɔ krataa kwan so.
I'll bring them tomorrow if it's a go.	Mede wɔn bɛba ɔkyena sɛ ɛyɛ kɔ a.
He lived with his mother and father.	Ɔne ne maame ne ne papa traa hɔ.
Move part of the floor to the back of the room.	Fa fam fã bi kɔ dan no akyi.
Thank you, my friends.	Meda mo ase, me nnamfo.
He did the same thing.	Ɔno nso yɛɛ saa.
All in one.	Ne nyinaa wɔ biako mu.
There is a back door here.	Akyi pon wɔ ha.
Most people do that.	Nnipa dodow no ara yɛ saa.
Maybe even hours.	Ebia nnɔnhwerew pii mpo.
Maybe there is something like that.	Ebia biribi a ɛte saa wɔ hɔ.
We will do our best.	Yɛbɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara.
There are many dangers out there.	Asiane pii wɔ abɔnten so.
Our thoughts are with him.	Yɛn adwene wɔ ne nkyɛn.
However, the accident happened in another part of town.	Nanso, akwanhyia no sii wɔ kurow no fã foforo.
Everything is too expensive here.	Biribiara bo yɛ den dodo wɔ ha.
However, I want one.	Nanso, mepɛ biako.
Just like his father.	Te sɛ ne papa no ara pɛ.
That’s the point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no.
This girl goes to school every day.	Saa abeawa yi kɔ sukuu da biara.
Your father	Wo papa .
There is just louder and louder music.	Nnwom a ano yɛ den na ano yɛ den ara kwa na ɛwɔ hɔ.
He and she are amazing.	Ɔne no yɛ nwonwa.
He knew her, too.	Na onim no, nso.
And so have you for the most part.	Na saa ara na woayɛ wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu.
This has really been the job.	Eyi ayɛ adwuma no ankasa.
So that song could have sent anyone home.	Enti anka saa dwom no betumi ama obiara akɔ fie.
I shouldn’t have gone.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
I understand.	Mete ase.
We don’t like it.	Yɛn ani nnye ho.
For instance .	Sɛ ebia .
Not his father.	Ɛnyɛ ne papa.
We need to update our system.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ yɛn nhyehyɛe no foforo.
But that was just me.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ me nkutoo.
Real value comes from production.	Bo ankasa fi nneɛma a wɔyɛ mu.
Not at your age.	Ɛnyɛ wo mfe mu.
This team will be much, much worse next year.	Saa kuw yi bɛyɛ bɔne kɛse, kɛse afe a edi hɔ no.
And this is nothing new.	Na eyi nyɛ ade foforo.
It’s never complicated.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den da.
I wanted one in my house.	Ná mepɛ biako wɔ me fie.
But some things take time.	Nanso nneɛma bi gye bere.
Play.	Bɔ.
The rest is added water.	Nea aka no yɛ nsu a wɔde ka ho.
I am sitting on one right now.	Mete biako so mprempren ara.
So he has the power.	Enti ɔno na ɔwɔ tumi.
You don’t have to do this now.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi mprempren.
It was truly amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
The same is true of all industries.	Saa ara na nnwuma ahorow no nyinaa nso te.
Was it day or night?	So na ɛyɛ awia anaa anadwo?
Tell him to do things.	Ka kyerɛ no sɛ ɔnyɛ nneɛma.
I had nothing to offer that everyone here wanted.	Ná minni biribiara a mede bɛma a obiara a ɔwɔ ha pɛ.
He has no control over this.	Onni eyi so tumi biara.
Animals have no sense of time.	Mmoa nni bere ho adwene.
Something had gone wrong here.	Ná biribi anyɛ yiye wɔ ha.
I expect you to do a better job.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ wobɛyɛ adwuma a eye sen saa.
In most cases.	Mpɛn pii no.
It’s a man.	Ɛyɛ ɔbarima.
You don’t need to say a thing.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wobɛka asɛm bi.
At least most of them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔn mu dodow no ara.
I think it’s a good one.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nea eye.
I didn’t think it was a good idea.	Na minsusuw sɛ ɛyɛ adwene pa.
That would be great.	Ɛno bɛyɛ kɛse.
Their gaze softened.	Wɔn ani a wɔde hwɛ ade no yɛɛ mmerɛw.
You need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
Make that clear to him.	Ma saa asɛm no mu nna hɔ mma no.
Just stay in the house.	Tra fie hɔ ara kwa.
How do we get there? 	Yɛbɛyɛ dɛn adu hɔ?
Just a moment.	Bere tiaa bi kɛkɛ.
When you have a child there you want the best.	Sɛ wowɔ abofra wɔ hɔ a wopɛ nea eye sen biara.
But this is not such a case.	Nanso eyi nyɛ asɛm a ɛte saa.
Most likely his wife's.	Ɛda adi kɛse sɛ ne yere de.
Every day, one, every day.	Da biara, biako, da biara.
It looked beautiful.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
They are just human beings.	Wɔyɛ nnipa ara kwa.
What are the three best things?	Dɛn ne nneɛma abiɛsa a eye sen biara?
It’s all true.	Ne nyinaa yɛ nokware.
This is not easy to do.	Eyi nyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobɛyɛ.
I know you know you want a piece of that.	Minim sɛ wunim sɛ wopɛ saa asɛm no fã bi.
And it certainly wasn’t true.	Na ampa ara na ɛnyɛ nokware.
He had to win.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ odi nkonim.
You can’t tell on that.	Worentumi nhu wɔ saa asɛm no so.
There is little hope for this child.	Anidaso kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ ma abofra yi.
I feel it.	Mete nka.
He did no work himself.	Ɔno ankasa anyɛ adwuma biara.
That is really hard for us.	Ɛno yɛ den ma yɛn ankasa.
The dog was surprisingly fast.	Ná ɔkraman no yɛ ntɛmntɛm ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It was too late anyway.	Ná aka akyi dodo ɔkwan biara so.
And for the most part it’s true.	Na fã kɛse no ara no ɛyɛ nokware.
Give it a little life for them.	Ma no nkwa kakra mma wɔn.
We do it for each other.	Yɛyɛ ma yɛn ho yɛn ho.
You can check it out here.	Wubetumi ahwɛ wɔ ha.
However, I love your books.	Nanso, m’ani gye mo nhoma ahorow ho.
It’s the same thing.	Ɛte saa ara.
And it should be fun every time.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye bere biara.
It's too hot to work until it's hot.	Ɛyɛ hyew dodo sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma kosi sɛ ɛbɛyɛ hyew.
Their last song was great though.	Wɔn dwom a etwa to no yɛɛ kɛse de, nanso.
The dog sat in the back of the car.	Ɔkraman no traa kar no akyi.
Maybe it’s a lot, or maybe not so much.	Ebia ɛyɛ pii, anaasɛ ebia ɛnyɛ pii saa.
And maybe it doesn’t matter.	Na ebia ɛho nhia.
But I still need help.	Nanso meda so ara hia mmoa.
You know what has happened.	Wunim nea akɔ so.
You will become what you are.	Wobɛyɛ nea woyɛ.
You are definitely not very good.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wonyɛ papa koraa.
Try talking about it and try again.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wobɛka ho asɛm na san bɔ mmɔden bio.
They are all in the same city.	Wɔn nyinaa wɔ kurow koro mu.
Who wants to drive?	Hena na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka kar?
He knew a lot about her.	Ná onim nneɛma pii fa ne ho.
I wanted to see it again.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu bio.
He has the best hands.	Ɔno na ɔwɔ nsa a eye sen biara.
And your mother was there.	Na wo maame nso wɔ hɔ.
Kick as hard as you can.	Bɔ wo nan denneennen sɛnea wubetumi.
Good things and bad things.	Nneɛma pa ne nneɛma bɔne.
Just walk a lot.	Nantew pii kɛkɛ.
But his head really hurt.	Nanso ne ti yɛɛ no ​​yaw ankasa.
However, he knew it was over.	Nanso, na onim sɛ aba awiei.
Things seemed to improve for a while.	Ɛte sɛ nea nneɛma mu yɛɛ yiye bere tiaa bi.
Use this product sparingly.	Fa saa ade yi nni dwuma kakraa bi.
And people are very interested in it.	Na nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse.
She wants to look good.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Drop me some of your comments.	Fa wo nsɛm bi to me.
I can still play.	Meda so ara tumi di agoru.
Three times a week.	Mpɛn abiɛsa dapɛn biara.
But we can enjoy what we have in the here and now.	Nanso yebetumi anya nea yɛwɔ wɔ ha ne mprempren no mu anigye.
Date for each species.	Da a wɔde bɛma mmoa ahorow biara.
Which is not painful.	Nea ɛnyɛ yaw.
It works for me.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ma me.
Everything went well.	Biribiara kɔɔ so yiye.
He leaned against the door.	Ɔde ne ho too ɔpon no anim.
He is as great as you are.	Ɔyɛ kɛse te sɛ wo.
Just give what we have.	Fa nea yɛwɔ no ma kɛkɛ.
That seems like a bad idea.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ adwene bɔne.
Later this worked well.	Akyiri yi eyi yɛɛ adwuma yiye.
If it was common.	Sɛ na abu so a.
It may also be dangerous.	Ebia asiane wom nso.
I've been thinking about you.	Mayɛ wo ho adwene.
Our house was extremely crowded this weekend.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ yɛn fie hɔ ma kɛse dapɛn awiei yi.
He was a bad guy.	Na ɔyɛ ɔbarima bɔne.
It’s not about me.	Ɛnyɛ me ho asɛm.
The next story was more interesting.	Ná asɛm a edi hɔ no yɛ anigye kɛse.
The moon is getting bigger.	Ɔsram no reyɛ kɛse.
It seems like a big mistake.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
I love that moment in the summer.	M’ani gye saa bere no ho wɔ awɔw mu.
But not a few years ago.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ mfe kakraa bi a atwam ni.
This was the case.	Ná eyi te saa.
Everything has good times and bad times.	Biribiara wɔ bere pa ne bere bɔne.
I want to believe it.	Mepɛ sɛ migye di.
In order to do so.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛbɛyɛ saa.
And that in itself is pretty awesome.	Na ɛno ankasa yɛ hu yiye.
A thick head of hair, just slightly rough.	Ti a ti nhwi yɛ den, a ɛyɛ mmerɛw kakra kɛkɛ.
It’s like making the bed for her kids.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔreyɛ mpa no ama ne mma.
His eyes were on hers.	Ná n’ani da ne de so.
And you were there.	Na wowɔ hɔ.
Just what this situation needs.	Nea tebea yi hia ara kwa.
He didn’t like many things.	Ná n’ani nnye nneɛma pii ho.
That doesn’t matter.	Ɛno nyɛ hwee.
Another week ahead.	Dapɛn foforo da yɛn anim.
I hear them all the time now.	Mete wɔn bere nyinaa mprempren.
The strong ones.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ den no.
I know you know things.	Minim sɛ wunim nneɛma.
But not me and him.	Nanso ɛnyɛ me ne ɔno de.
Everyone is very nice.	Obiara ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
She ran into the bedroom.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ mpa no mu.
I want to bring you in on something.	Mepɛ sɛ mede wo ba mu wɔ biribi ho.
Just a few days.	Nna kakraa bi pɛ.
I have no idea what it is.	Minni nea ɛyɛ ho adwene biara.
He seems to be working on some new things.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔreyɛ nneɛma foforo bi ho adwuma.
Perhaps in the city I had already been forgotten.	Ebia wɔ kurow no mu no na wɔn werɛ afi me dedaw.
That didn’t work either.	Ɛno nso anyɛ adwuma.
That would be exciting.	Ɛno bɛyɛ anigye.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Mempɛ sɛ meka ho asɛm.
We can see this.	Yebetumi ahu eyi.
When you see yourself.	Bere a wuhu wo ho no.
So what are they.	Enti dɛn ne wɔn.
If not, tell me.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ka kyerɛ me.
Really.	Pa ara.
And that’s not surprising.	Na ɛno nyɛ nwonwa.
A terrible accident happened.	Akwanhyia a ɛyɛ hu sii.
So, please don’t talk about him like that again.	Enti, mesrɛ wo, nka ne ho asɛm saa bio.
They are something and nothing at the same time.	Wɔyɛ biribi na ɛnyɛ hwee bere koro mu.
How are you doing.	Wo ho te dɛn.
He was interested in it.	Ná n’ani gye ho.
That’s the first one.	Ɛno ne nea edi kan.
Start using it again.	Fi ase de di dwuma bio.
One chance for each person.	Hokwan biako ma onipa biara.
Everything went really well.	Biribiara kɔɔ so yiye ankasa.
Only the book.	Nhoma no nkutoo.
. . . .	.
I’d love to do that.	M’ani begye sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
He did so.	Ɔyɛɛ saa.
Which is a very, very hard thing to do.	Nea ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ den yiye paa sɛ wobɛyɛ.
The tests need not work on a real problem.	Ɛho nhia sɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow no yɛ ɔhaw ankasa bi ho adwuma.
Just take them here.	Fa wɔn kɔ ha kɛkɛ.
Things have been just as great ever since.	Nneɛma akɔ so ayɛ kɛse saa ara fi saa bere no.
Things were heating up.	Ná nneɛma reyɛ hyew.
It’s not really clear why.	Ɛnyɛ nea enti a ɛte saa no mu nna hɔ ankasa.
A single thought followed by words.	Adwene biako pɛ a nsɛm di akyi.
And think of my father now.	Na susuw me papa ho mprempren.
And no one was seeing him.	Na na obiara nhu no.
Not so much since then.	Ɛnyɛ saa kɛse fi saa bere no.
There is little need here.	Ɛho nhia kakraa bi wɔ ha.
In other words,	Ɔkwan foforo so no, .
Make sure they do.	Hwɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He has helped his mother for many years.	Ɔde mfe pii aboa ne maame.
Again,	Bio,
They had a problem.	Ɔhaw bi baa wɔn so.
But that’s when something amazing happened.	Nanso ɛno ne bere a biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii.
Commit to something, start over.	Fa wo ho hyɛ biribi mu, fi ase bio.
We both remember at the same time.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa kae bere koro mu.
That was not too difficult.	Ná ɛno nyɛ den dodo.
Planning was on its way.	Ná nhyehyɛe rekɔ ne kwan so.
And that, too, is there.	Na ɛno nso, ɛwɔ hɔ.
He wants to be busy.	Ɔpɛ sɛ onni adagyew.
The time to rejoice is now.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn ani gye ne mprempren.
This was their fault.	Ná eyi yɛ wɔn mfomso.
The study ended last month.	Adesua no baa awiei wɔ ɔsram a etwaam no mu.
We always bring first impressions to the table.	Yɛde adwene a edi kan ba pon no so bere nyinaa.
Anyway, back to the point.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, san kɔ asɛm no so.
I want to go out with you again.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kɔ abɔnten bio.
It’s not a terrible game.	Ɛnyɛ agoru a ɛyɛ hu.
The next one is less important.	Nea edi hɔ no ho nhia pii.
Finally, he can find out.	Awiei koraa no, obetumi ahu.
That was him.	Ná ɛno ne ɔno.
He wanted to be alone.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno nkutoo tra hɔ.
And it needed to be that way.	Na ɛho hia sɛ ɛte saa.
Do those weird things you love to do.	Yɛ saa nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa a w’ani gye ho sɛ wobɛyɛ no.
Every year is beautiful.	Mfe biara yɛ fɛ.
However, there is no picture.	Nanso, mfonini biara nni hɔ.
I don’t think it’s a bad thing.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛyɛ asɛm bɔne.
The innocent bed may be used as a study.	Ebia wɔde mpa a ɛho nni asɛm no bedi dwuma sɛ adesua.
The dress is available again.	Atade no ayɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ bio.
What matters is what isn’t at all.	Nea ɛho hia ne nea ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
And next we need to add a solid component to this object.	Na nea edi hɔ no ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde ade a ɛyɛ den ka ade yi ho.
I'm not hard on that.	Menyɛ den wɔ saa ade no ho.
Not that it is.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
However, it was amazing.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Not that he can see me.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ obetumi ahu me.
But this issue may not be here.	Nanso ebia asɛm yi nni ha.
However, this is really too complicated.	Nanso, eyi yɛ nea ɛyɛ den dodo ankasa.
Do it this way, it’s not.	Yɛ no saa kwan yi so, ɛnyɛ saa.
And it was so.	Na ɛte saa.
Take these items home.	Fa saa nneɛma yi kɔ fie.
He doesn’t even know their names.	Onnim wɔn din mpo.
I want to be a girly boy.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ abarimaa a ɔyɛ abeawa.
I can't make the next meeting.	Mintumi nyɛ nhyiam a edi hɔ no.
Everyone let their hair down.	Obiara maa ne ti nhwi baa fam.
That people want to act right now.	Sɛ nkurɔfo pɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ade mprempren ara.
People are interested in this.	Nkurɔfo ani gye eyi ho.
He’s working on it.	Ɔreyɛ ho adwuma.
I can tell you it’s important.	Metumi aka akyerɛ wo sɛ ɛho hia.
I received a very nice letter from him last week.	Me nsa kaa krataa a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye fii ne hɔ dapɛn a etwaam no.
So has mine been.	Saa ara na me de no nso ayɛ.
Drive home today.	Fa kar kɔ fie nnɛ.
I had lunch with him two days ago.	Me ne no dii awia aduan nna abien a atwam ni.
I still have it.	Meda so ara wɔ bi.
He stayed there for hours.	Ɔde nnɔnhwerew pii traa hɔ.
He and his people.	Ɔne ne nkurɔfo.
It’s that simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
But I have one point.	Nanso mewɔ asɛm biako.
They never forget.	Wɔn werɛ mfi da.
I’ve worked with him before.	Me ne no ayɛ adwuma pɛn.
I should have reached out to more people.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ nnipa pii nkyɛn.
The thing was impossible.	Ná ade no ntumi nyɛ yiye.
He sighed in pain.	Ɔde yaw bɔɔ ne mu ase.
Most of the children are in school uniforms.	Mmofra no mu dodow no ara hyɛ sukuu ntade.
He had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
It’s too much like the real thing.	Ɛte sɛ ade ankasa no dodo.
I think they are pretty good.	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ papa yiye.
He was sitting there now.	Ná ɔte hɔ mprempren.
Where there is nothing.	Baabi a hwee nni hɔ.
I love those years.	M’ani gye saa mfe no ho.
We are all good.	Yɛn nyinaa yɛ papa.
So that’s what you can do.	Enti ɛno ne nea wubetumi ayɛ.
But this time, he had to.	Nanso saa bere yi de, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
He did want something else.	Ná ɔpɛ biribi foforo ampa.
He had set his hat for her.	Ná ɔde ne kyɛw no asi hɔ ama no.
I agree with this too.	Me ne eyi nso yɛ adwene.
We are lucky to have him here.	Yɛwɔ anigye sɛ yɛwɔ no wɔ ha.
He’s not just interested in people, you know.	N’ani nnye nnipa nkutoo ho, wunim.
The trend continues.	Su no kɔ so.
Tomorrow was a big day for both of them.	Ná ɔkyena yɛ da kɛse ma wɔn baanu nyinaa.
This must be done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi.
So you recognize this song?	Enti wuhu saa dwom yi?
I can’t believe he’s here.	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɔwɔ ha.
Only what was hot here.	Nea na ɛyɛ hyew wɔ ha nkutoo.
For a moment anyway.	Bere tiaa bi mu ɔkwan biara so.
I thought it was good.	Misusuwii sɛ eye.
People start to leave.	Nkurɔfo fi ase fi hɔ kɔ.
His time seems to be running out.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne bere no reyɛ ayɛ tiaa.
It would be great if someone could help me with it.	Sɛ obi betumi aboa me wɔ ho a, anka ɛbɛyɛ papa.
There is still a problem from time to time.	Ɔhaw bi da so ara wɔ hɔ bere ne bere mu.
He had no idea what happiness was.	Ná onni nea anigye yɛ ho adwene biara.
But he had nothing to do with it.	Nanso na onni ho hwee yɛ.
It’s a terrible time.	Ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ hu.
However, it almost never works this way.	Nanso, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma wɔ saa kwan yi so da.
Be careful, too.	Hwɛ yiye.
He wanted to be with us.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka yɛn ho.
I am in a similar situation.	Mewɔ tebea a ɛte saa ara mu.
And we are	Na yɛyɛ .
He didn't want to do this.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ eyi.
At the same time,	Saa bere no ara, .
Many of us do that at that age.	Yɛn mu pii yɛ saa wɔ saa mfe no mu.
It was really really easy.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa ankasa.
And you can go on from there.	Na wubetumi akɔ so afi hɔ akɔ so.
The contents of this book are awesome.	Nhoma yi mu nsɛm yɛ hu.
The walk was long but enjoyable.	Ná nantew no tenten nanso na ɛyɛ anigye.
Many people saw us.	Nnipa pii huu yɛn.
I have a dog that is my baby.	Mewɔ ɔkraman bi a ɔyɛ me ba.
You never know how long these things take.	Wunnim bere tenten a saa nneɛma yi gye da.
The kids are doing that.	Mmofra no reyɛ saa.
Every night he worried about it.	Anadwo biara anadwo na ɔhaw ne ho wɔ ho.
Like he wanted her that way.	Te sɛ nea na ɔpɛ no saa.
Everything goes on.	Nneɛma nyinaa kɔ so.
I still have the pictures.	Meda so ara wɔ mfonini ahorow no.
That is the real joy.	Ɛno ne anigye ankasa.
All images are provided by third parties.	Mfonini ahorow no nyinaa yɛ nea nnipa foforo na wɔde ma.
I believe it is not.	Migye di sɛ ɛnte saa.
Something tells me we can do better.	Biribi ka kyerɛ me sɛ yebetumi ayɛ yiye.
I did the whole thing.	Me na meyɛɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
This affected him.	Eyi kaa no.
There are currently few vacancies.	Mprempren adwuma kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛda hɔ.
I don’t want to be that person anymore.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa onipa no bio.
Which we were, for years.	Nea na yɛyɛ, mfe pii.
His was easy.	Ná ne de no yɛ mmerɛw.
And you will do that.	Na wobɛyɛ saa.
Many new problems have been established.	Wɔde ɔhaw foforo pii asi hɔ.
Maybe he planned the party then.	Ebia na ɔyɛɛ apontow no ho nhyehyɛe saa bere no.
Every last bit of it.	Nea etwa to biara a ɛwɔ mu.
I didn’t know when you would.	Na minnim bere a wobɛyɛ.
I would have liked him.	Anka m’ani begye ne ho.
I’m not happy.	M’ani nnye.
Someone else does the same.	Obi foforo nso yɛ saa.
And you may have done it right.	Na ebia woayɛ no yiye.
You brought me to life.	Wo na wode me baa nkwa mu.
Nor is there any reason why it should.	Saa ara nso na biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
It was just me.	Ná ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
They do something about it.	Wɔyɛ ho biribi.
A big risk, but we could manage it.	Asiane kɛse, nanso na yebetumi adi ho dwuma.
Probably more of the same.	Ebia pii a ɛte saa ara.
But they were strong before.	Nanso na wɔn ho yɛ den kan.
The real thing is what it is.	Ade ankasa ne nea ɛte.
You know what this is.	Wunim nea eyi yɛ.
The team was underperforming.	Ná kuw no ntumi nyɛ adwuma yiye.
I don’t know what he’s done to you.	Minnim nea wayɛ wo.
You don’t have to do anything big with it.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode bɛyɛ ade kɛse bi.
That’s why we need to use it properly.	Ɛno nti na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde di dwuma yiye no.
It wasn’t just his city.	Na ɛnyɛ ne kurow no ara kwa.
He did that in a game.	Ɔyɛɛ saa wɔ agoru bi mu.
Which was true enough.	Nea na ɛyɛ nokware a ɛdɔɔso.
I don't know about that.	Minnim saa asɛm no ho hwee.
Maybe a lot of time.	Ebia bere pii.
So, for so long.	Enti, bere tenten saa.
Do not touch any of his hair.	Mfa wo nsa nka ne ti nhwi biara.
It has been in use ever since.	Wɔde adi dwuma fi saa bere no.
She feels very strong on the phone.	Ɔte nka sɛ ne ho yɛ den yiye wɔ telefon so.
I know you can.	Minim sɛ wubetumi.
So sorry, so sorry.	Enti kyɛw, enti kyɛw.
Both the child and the boy cooperated.	Abofra no ne abarimaa no nyinaa yɛɛ biako.
I'm sorry it was him.	Mepa wo kyɛw sɛ na ɛyɛ ɔno.
They are the story.	Wɔn ne asɛm no.
You are completely new.	Woyɛ foforo koraa.
You are not a real person.	Wonyɛ obi ankasa.
He had no idea what to do.	Ná onni nea ɔbɛyɛ ho adwene biara.
For more information you can check here.	Sɛ wopɛ nsɛm pii a wubetumi ahwɛ ha.
He stepped up to her side.	Ɔde ne nan sii ne nkyɛn.
Apparently that’s not even his real name.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ ne din ankasa mpo ne no.
I didn’t know this at the time.	Saa bere no na minnim eyi.
The latter is by far my favorite.	Nea etwa to no ne nea m’ani gye ho kɛse koraa.
It hurts even more.	Ɛyɛ yaw kɛse mpo.
None of them worked.	Wɔn mu biara anyɛ adwuma.
Or maybe the reverse.	Anaasɛ ebia nea ɛwɔ akyi no.
His power day.	Ne tumi da no.
I did that for him.	Meyɛɛ saa maa no.
It’s out there.	Ɛwɔ abɔnten hɔ.
You look just like him.	Wo ho te sɛ ɔno ara pɛ.
I still have that problem.	Meda so ara wɔ saa ɔhaw no.
No problem at all.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ koraa.
They were good people.	Ná wɔyɛ nnipa pa.
More on that later.	Ɛno ho nsɛm pii akyiri yi.
He arranged the infrastructure.	Ɔyɛɛ nneɛma a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma no ho nhyehyɛe.
Check out a few of the…	Hwɛ kakraa bi a wɔde di dwuma wɔ...
All pictures are not the same.	Mfonini ahorow no nyinaa nyɛ pɛ.
Not that one either.	Ɛnyɛ saa biako no nso.
If you are honest, you were right.	Sɛ woka nokware a, na woayɛ no yiye.
But I’m happy now.	Nanso m’ani agye mprempren.
He was one of those people.	Ná ɔyɛ saa nnipa no mu biako.
I was on it again.	Ná mewɔ so bio.
And that’s the idea, anyway.	Na ɛno ne adwene no, sɛnea ɛte biara.
He is the only one alive now.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔte ase mprempren.
What matters is what isn’t at all.	Nea ɛho hia ne nea ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
And anyone can do it.	Na obiara betumi ayɛ.
He told me that he does.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
But they rely on one party.	Nanso wɔde wɔn ho to apontow biako so.
Do whatever works.	Yɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ adwuma biara.
That’s the other way around.	Ɛno ne ɔkwan foforo no.
I don’t have any problems.	Minni ɔhaw biara.
Think about what is most important to you.	Susuw nea ɛho hia wo paa no ho.
We do this according to .	Yɛyɛ eyi sɛnea ɛwɔ .
But last year was one of those years.	Nanso afe a etwaam no yɛ saa mfe no mu biako.
There is plenty of time to tell me the truth.	Bere pii wɔ hɔ a mede bɛka nokware no akyerɛ me.
Thank you !!.	Meda wo ase !!.
The timing was impeccable.	Ná bere a wɔde yɛɛ adwuma no yɛ nea mfomso biara nni ho.
That’s a long shot.	Ɛno yɛ tuo tenten.
He was busy making initial arrangements.	Ná onni adagyew sɛ ɔbɛyɛ nhyehyɛe a edi kan.
You see where this is going, though.	Nanso, wuhu baabi a eyi rekɔ.
It wasn’t going.	Ná ɛnyɛ kɔ.
He slammed his hand on the table.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ pon no so.
The game was great fun.	Ná agoru no yɛ anigye kɛse.
I’m not much into music.	M’ani nnye nnwom ho kɛse.
Next time, wear a hat.	Bere foforo no, hyɛ kyɛw.
And that’s what it is.	Na ɛno ne sɛ.
If that happened to us.	Sɛ ɛno too yɛn a.
However, this was not possible either.	Nanso, na eyi nso ntumi nyɛ yiye.
If what you are doing is working for you, good.	Sɛ nea woreyɛ no reyɛ adwuma ama wo a, eye.
It is also used to quantify.	Wɔde di dwuma nso de kyerɛ dodow a ɛwɔ hɔ.
We can put some music in a little bit.	Yebetumi de nnwom bi ahyɛ mu kakra.
There was no way he could have saved them.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ a anka obetumi agye wɔn nkwa.
The room is full of surprises.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa ahyɛ dan no mu ma.
What you see is long overdue.	Nea wuhu no akyɛ.
He wanted to be great.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ kɛse.
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa.
These shoes look so good on you.	Saa mpaboa yi hwɛ wo yiye paa.
No wonder we are full of joy.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ anigye ahyɛ yɛn ma.
There is plenty of room.	Baabi a ɛdɔɔso wɔ hɔ.
I really have to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ankasa.
It seems strange.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There seemed to be no hope.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea anidaso biara nni mu.
This is often not true.	Eyi taa nyɛ nokware.
I know something you don’t.	Minim biribi a wo nso wunnim.
Maybe tomorrow, maybe in a year.	Ebia ɔkyena, ebia afe biako mu.
Most of the time, that wasn’t the case for me.	Mpɛn pii no, na ɛnyɛ saa wɔ me fam.
Do it right.	Yɛ no yiye.
One of them would have been bad enough on its own.	Anka wɔn mu biako ankasa bɛyɛ bɔne sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Most of us are past that now.	Yɛn dodow no ara atwam saa mprempren.
I'm pretty good at stuff like this.	Me ho akokwaw yiye wɔ nneɛma te sɛ eyi mu.
They just seemed to enjoy the music.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani gye nnwom no ho ara kwa.
It seemed like a great deal.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ade kɛse.
Maybe it’s too perfect.	Ebia ɛyɛ pɛ dodo.
It’s not enough.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
Don’t be afraid of it.	Mma w’ani nnye ho.
Using some years to be ageless.	Mfe bi a wode bedi dwuma na ama woayɛ obi a onni mfe.
And so you trust it even more.	Na enti wode wo ho to so kɛse mpo.
And that’s me.	Na ɛno ne me.
I got that, one night.	Me nsa kaa saa, anadwo bi.
She combed her hair.	Ɔde ne ti nhwi yɛɛ ne ti nhwi.
I couldn’t believe it for a moment.	Na mintumi nnye nni bere tiaa bi.
The other man approached him.	Ɔbarima foforo no baa ne nkyɛn.
Money could solve problems for each of them.	Ná sika betumi adi ɔhaw ahorow ho dwuma ama wɔn mu biara.
Here are a few reasons why.	Nneɛma kakraa bi a enti ɛte saa ni.
But this works really well.	Nanso eyi yɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
It wasn’t the same room, and it wasn’t the same bed.	Na ɛnyɛ dan koro no ara, na na ɛnyɛ mpa koro nso.
Or start from a different direction.	Anaasɛ fi ase fi ɔkwan foforo so.
He knew both.	Ná onim abien no nyinaa.
And that’s the most amazing thing.	Na ɛno ne ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen biara.
The boy failed to come home last night.	Abarimaa no antumi amma fie anadwo a etwaam no.
They nodded as we put everything away.	Wɔde wɔn ti too fam bere a yɛde biribiara too hɔ no.
It’s me again.	Ɛyɛ me bio.
These inputs are time-sensitive.	Saa nsɛm a wɔde hyɛ mu yi fa bere ho.
He wasn't there, but he knows.	Ná onni hɔ, nanso onim.
I can't say when.	Mintumi nka bere bɛn.
One interesting thing about them	Ade biako a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ wɔn
It’s nice to have you here with her.	Ɛyɛ anigye sɛ wo ne no wɔ ha.
So it would be great if someone could help me.	Enti sɛ obi betumi aboa me a anka ɛbɛyɛ papa.
Knock hard on the door.	Bɔ ɔpon no mu denneennen.
But next weekend it will.	Nanso dapɛn awiei a edi hɔ no ɛbɛyɛ saa.
The bus was late.	Ná bɔs no aka akyi.
It wasn’t pretty stuff.	Ná ɛnyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Most people should already know that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nnipa dodow no ara nim saa dedaw.
Not me, by any means.	Ɛnyɛ me, ɔkwan biara so.
I like your plan.	M’ani gye wo nhyehyɛe no ho.
Something had gone wrong with his eyes.	Ná biribi anyɛ yiye wɔ n’ani so.
No one can do that.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ saa.
However, he and his wife have nothing left.	Nanso, ɔne ne yere nni hwee bio.
Tomorrow you will be fine.	Ɔkyena wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
The book is filled with beautiful illustrations.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ ahyɛ nhoma no ma.
It seemed to be true.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
However, it may be difficult to implement.	Nanso, ebia ɛbɛyɛ den sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma.
He has finally done it.	Wayɛ no awiei koraa.
He may be planning his next move right now.	Ebia ɔreyɛ ne tu a edi hɔ no ho nhyehyɛe mprempren ara.
You can do this in advance.	Wubetumi adi kan ayɛ eyi.
We are on the wrong.	Yɛwɔ mfomso no so.
This is my problem.	Me haw ni.
This time he looked like a different man.	Saa bere yi de na ɔte sɛ ɔbarima foforo.
I'm sorry about last night.	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ anadwo a etwaam no ho.
I hope this can continue throughout the year.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ eyi betumi akɔ so wɔ afe no mu nyinaa.
He wanted to forget it all.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ne werɛ fi ne nyinaa.
The water was fresh.	Ná nsu no yɛ foforo.
Was there a little earlier.	So na ɛwɔ hɔ ntɛm kakra.
I’d appreciate it if nobody interfered.	Sɛ obiara mfa ne ho nnye mu a, m’ani begye ho.
You have your friends.	Wowɔ wo nnamfo.
I like it to be honest.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛka nokware.
A few more would be great.	Kakraa bi bio bɛyɛ kɛse.
It’s everything to him.	Ɛyɛ biribiara ma no.
I love it when people do that.	Sɛ nkurɔfo yɛ saa a, m’ani gye ho yiye.
I never wanted that.	Ná mempɛ saa da.
Now the years have been blurry.	Seesei mfe no ayɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
Can you time travel?	So wubetumi atu kwan wɔ bere mu?
I use this product all the time.	Mede saa ade yi di dwuma bere nyinaa.
Over and over and over again.	Mpɛn pii ne mpɛn pii.
Somewhere out there.	Wɔ abɔnten hɔ baabi.
But my book is still there.	Nanso me nhoma no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
But he knew, again, that this wasn’t true.	Nanso na onim, bio, sɛ eyi nyɛ nokware.
That seems too easy.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ mmerɛw dodo.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni saa asɛm no mu.
But be quick about it.	Nanso yɛ ntɛm wɔ ho.
But there was nothing .	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ .
It’s not us.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn.
The city prospered greatly.	Kurow no dii yiye kɛse.
That’s what happened last year.	Ɛno ne nea esii wɔ afe a etwaam no mu.
You shouldn’t have been hurt.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo yaw.
Music can do that to you.	Nnwom betumi ayɛ wo saa.
These people treated me so very humanely.	Saa nkurɔfo yi ne me dii nnipa su kɛse saa.
He is strong.	Ɔyɛ den.
The same is true.	Saa ara nso na.
This was the best part of the night.	Ná eyi ne anadwo no fã a eye sen biara.
A night of fun.	Anadwo a wɔde gye wɔn ani.
But it was a very good story.	Nanso na ɛyɛ asɛm a eye paa.
He was in a lot of trouble.	Ná ɔwɔ ɔhaw pii mu.
So will a man, thank you.	Saa ara na ɔbarima bɛyɛ no, meda wo ase.
Just plug in and go.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu kɛkɛ na kɔ.
I would do anything for you.	Anka mɛyɛ biribiara ama wo.
He looked perfect.	Ná ɔte sɛ nea ɔyɛ pɛ.
I guess that’s for another time.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ bere foforo de.
And every day.	Na da biara da.
I can get used to this, you think.	Metumi ayɛ eyi ho su, wususuw.
It’s simple but it’s strong.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw nanso ɛyɛ den.
The man approached quickly.	Ɔbarima no bɛn no ntɛmntɛm.
I am doing enough.	Meyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
This is a big, big deal.	Eyi yɛ ade kɛse, kɛse.
And you can just see it.	Na wubetumi ahu ara kwa.
The police did so.	Polisifo no yɛɛ saa.
Only the truth.	Nokware no nkutoo.
First, they are interested.	Nea edi kan no, wɔn ani gye ho.
He spent a lot of time working on it.	Ɔde bere pii yɛɛ ho adwuma.
This thing?	Saa ade yi?
I just can’t imagine it.	Mintumi nsusuw ho kɛkɛ.
There are many schools in this town.	Sukuu ahorow pii wɔ kurow yi mu.
He was like their father.	Ná ɔte sɛ wɔn papa.
And if things don’t work out.	Na sɛ nneɛma nkɔ yiye a.
He looks like a nice, strong man.	Ɔte sɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ na ne ho yɛ den.
This is my favorite season.	Eyi ne bere a m’ani gye ho paa.
The present has never been more interesting.	Mprempren de no ani nnye ho kɛse da.
He is a very nice guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
On the same day, the same general consensus prevailed.	Da koro no ara, adwene koro no ara a ɛwɔ nnipa nyinaa mu no dii nkonim.
And we are good at it.	Na yɛn ho akokwaw wɔ mu.
It was very beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
However, this does not mean that they should.	Nanso, eyi nkyerɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
He just worked.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma ara kwa.
He and his friends turn around.	Ɔne ne nnamfo no dan wɔn ho.
We have a winner!	Yɛwɔ obi a odi nkonim!
You have to remind me of his name.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wokae me ne din.
It’s been three days since that day.	Ɛyɛ nnansa fi saa da no.
Again, it doesn’t matter.	Bio nso, ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia.
But it does.	Nanso ɛyɛ saa.
His book was not very good.	Ná ne nhoma no nyɛ papa koraa.
I told him a good job.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​adwuma pa.
But most of those people have gone.	Nanso saa nnipa no mu dodow no ara akɔ.
He spent that time brewing.	Ɔde saa bere no yɛɛ nsa.
Maybe it was a little bit of both.	Ebia na ɛyɛ abien no nyinaa kakra.
If you want to argue, fine.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ wugye akyinnye a, eye.
I had forgotten all about that.	Ná me werɛ afi saa asɛm no nyinaa.
It was hard, hard.	Ná ɛyɛ den, na ɛyɛ den.
However, I don’t know why.	Nanso, minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
But he shouldn’t have worried.	Nanso anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔhaw ne ho.
I added it.	Mede kaa ho.
Hit them fast.	Bɔ wɔn ntɛmntɛm.
I did know that.	Ná minim saa ampa.
The population grew rapidly.	Nnipa dodow kɔɔ anim ntɛmntɛm.
You will do that.	Wobɛyɛ saa.
We absolutely love it there.	Yɛn ani gye ho koraa wɔ hɔ.
People like him at work.	Nnipa ani gye ne ho wɔ adwumam.
The idea was great.	Ná adwene no yɛ kɛse.
However, everything repeated itself.	Nanso, biribiara san yɛɛ ne ho bio.
We took advantage of the opportunity.	Yɛde hokwan no dii dwuma.
Your plan will work.	Wo nhyehyɛe no bɛyɛ adwuma.
It doesn’t seem so hard anymore.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ den saa bio.
I love our team.	M’ani gye yɛn kuw no ho.
I found the book from there.	Mihuu nhoma no fii hɔ.
Outside the city, the story was similar.	Wɔ kurow no akyi no, na asɛm no te saa ara.
I told him, nothing.	Meka kyerɛɛ no, hwee.
But it’s not an easy task.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Usually, that doesn’t matter to you.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛno mfa wo ho.
But he knew there was nothing he could do.	Nanso na onim sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
Not one of them did anything.	Wɔn mu biako mpo anyɛ hwee.
Take the thing.	Fa ade no.
And the last one was mine.	Na nea etwa to no yɛ me de no.
We can use you.	Yebetumi de wo adi dwuma.
Keep it simple.	Fa to hɔ ma ɛnyɛ den.
I understand why this works.	Mete nea enti a eyi yɛ adwuma no ase.
Not that you were.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na woyɛ saa.
So everyone knew my father.	Enti na obiara nim me papa.
I took the bus back to the city.	Mede bɔs san kɔɔ kurow no mu.
No one could see it.	Obiara antumi anhu.
Remove it immediately.	Yi fi hɔ ntɛm ara.
No one really told me.	Obiara ankasa ankyerɛ me.
You don’t know how to do it.	Wunnim sɛnea wobɛyɛ.
Think about it on paper.	Susuw ho wɔ krataa so.
None of them except you.	Wɔn mu biara gye wo nkutoo.
He was a dog from day one.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔkraman fi da a edi kan no.
He looked at her with interest.	Ɔde anigye hwɛɛ no.
Her dresses were always too short.	Ná ne ntade yɛ tiaa dodo bere nyinaa.
There is no doubt about this.	Akyinnye biara nni eyi ho.
He did so immediately.	Ɔyɛɛ saa ntɛm ara.
I have pictures.	Mewɔ mfonini ahorow.
It’s not like that.	Ɛnyɛ saa.
The new information shocked people.	Nsɛm foforo no maa nkurɔfo ho dwiriw wɔn.
He doesn’t make many mental mistakes.	Ɔnyɛ adwene mu mfomso pii.
Set aside and keep warm until use.	Fa to nkyɛn na ma ɛnyɛ hyew kosi sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
But he knew it.	Nanso na onim.
I was fast on the test.	Ná meyɛ ntɛm wɔ sɔhwɛ no mu.
People come to the party.	Nkurɔfo ba apontow no ase.
It’s a very simple concept.	Ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
The reason behind this is less clear.	Nea enti a eyi akyi no mu nna hɔ kɛse.
It was like a car accident.	Ná ɛte sɛ kar akwanhyia.
Everyone except him.	Obiara gye ɔno nkutoo.
What he wants.	Nea ɔpɛ.
I really like these things.	M’ani gye saa nneɛma yi ho ankasa.
A lot of the same as it was in the past.	Nneɛma pii a ɛte sɛ nea na ɛte bere bi a atwam no.
I don’t have a good handle on it.	Minni nsa pa wɔ so.
She didn’t like the man.	Ná n’ani nnye ɔbarima no ho.
But it was wet.	Nanso na ɛyɛ nsu.
It’s hard to do.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ.
You’ll be interested in that.	W’ani begye saa asɛm no ho.
The situation was desperate.	Ná tebea no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
Remember this man?.	Wokae saa ɔbarima yi?.
He spent the weekend with us.	Ɔne yɛn dii dapɛn awiei no.
I tell you many jobs.	Meka nnwuma pii kyerɛ wo.
He showed her a pair of shoes.	Ɔde mpaboa bi kyerɛɛ no.
You must be a girl.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ abeawa.
And much this way it is with me.	Na pii saa kwan yi so na ɛte wɔ me ho.
In other words.	Ɔkwan foforo so no.
It wasn’t his way.	Ná ɛnyɛ ne kwan.
That’s never a problem.	Ɛno nyɛ ɔhaw da.
I just think it’s what it looks like.	Misusuw kɛkɛ sɛ ɛyɛ sɛnea ɛte.
This is the best of the best.	Eyi yɛ nea eye sen biara.
Like your name is.	Te sɛ nea wo din te.
I can’t even.	Mintumi mpo.
Say a month.	Ka sɛ ɔsram biako.
Everything has its time.	Biribiara wɔ ne bere.
This is usually what you want to do.	Mpɛn pii no eyi ne nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Sleep is important.	Nna ho hia.
He may not have been perfect, but he was there for us.	Ebia na ɔnyɛ pɛ, nanso na ɔwɔ hɔ ma yɛn.
I handed him a letter.	Mede krataa bi maa no.
You can book three days in advance.	Wubetumi adi kan ayɛ nhyehyɛe nnansa.
The music is here, as well as the lyrics.	Nnwom no wɔ ha, ne nsɛm no nso.
There was very little of it.	Ná kakraa bi pɛ na ɛwɔ mu.
This can mean many different things.	Eyi betumi akyerɛ nneɛma ahorow pii.
One was simply timing.	Ná biako ne bere a wɔde yɛ nneɛma ara kwa.
Some things just take time.	Nneɛma bi gye bere kɛkɛ.
But it is important.	Nanso ɛho hia.
As soon as you see them, get involved.	Sɛ wuhu wɔn ara pɛ a, fa wo ho hyɛ mu.
It must be given.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde ma.
He is in trouble.	Ɔwɔ ɔhaw mu.
You do not need to enter any of our information.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode yɛn nsɛm no mu biara hyɛ mu.
Nor has anyone else.	Saa ara nso na obi foforo biara nyɛɛ saa.
He’s enjoyed it.	N’ani gyee ho.
Now their best hope lies on the highway.	Mprempren wɔn anidaso a eye sen biara no da ɔkwan kɛse no so.
His wife found out about me.	Ne yere huu me ho asɛm.
She has a child to deal with.	Ɔwɔ abofra a ɛsɛ sɛ odi ne ho dwuma.
Let me do the talking.	Ma menyɛ kasa no.
It should be easy and fun.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ anigye.
But in the end, he was there.	Nanso awiei koraa no, na ɔwɔ hɔ.
Return to the status quo.	San kɔ tebea a na ɛte kan no so.
Check out some of the services we offer.	Hwɛ nnwuma a yɛde ma no bi.
I like this one the best.	M’ani gye eyi ho sen biara.
Give your help.	Fa wo mmoa ma.
We used a lot of them in the movie.	Yɛde wɔn pii dii dwuma wɔ sini no mu.
I should have brought something for him.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mede biribi ba de ma no.
However, this situation is obviously too complicated.	Nanso, ɛda adi sɛ tebea yi mu yɛ den dodo.
This was not my intention.	Ná eyi nyɛ m’adwene.
It was an important issue.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛho hia.
There are obviously identities.	Ɛda adi sɛ nnipa a wɔyɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho wɔ hɔ.
So just watch it.	Enti hwɛ ara kwa.
The situation is now.	Tebea no mprempren.
He was a very interesting person.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a n’ani gye ho kɛse.
Water scarcity becomes more common.	Nsu a ɛho yɛ na no bɛyɛ nea abu so kɛse.
I want to want him.	Mepɛ sɛ mepɛ no.
He was in a terrible state.	Ná ɔwɔ tebea a ɛyɛ hu mu.
And it was very good for me.	Na na eye ma me paa.
The school is close to my house.	Sukuu no bɛn me fie.
He didn't know how much, or how bad.	Ná onnim dodow ahe, anaa sɛnea ɛyɛ bɔne.
Good stories and characters.	Nsɛm pa ne nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm.
But no one should be here.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara wɔ ha.
Used in idle vehicles.	Wɔde di dwuma wɔ kar ahorow a ɛnyɛ adwuma mu.
Can anyone do that.	So obi betumi ayɛ saa.
Many people don’t know about this.	Nnipa pii nnim eyi ho asɛm.
Looks like fun.	Hwɛ sɛ anigye.
He is devoted to the party.	Ɔde ne ho ama apontow no.
They certainly do.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I have no idea what is going on.	Minnim nea ɛrekɔ so no ho adwene biara.
They are all the same price.	Ne nyinaa bo yɛ pɛ.
Check out the full story here.	Hwɛ asɛm no nyinaa wɔ ha.
We can’t go back though.	Yɛn ntumi nkɔ akyi nanso.
These are not good days.	Eyi nyɛ nna pa.
He didn't know himself yesterday.	Ná onnim ne ho nnansa yi.
We were driving and these cops go after us.	Na yɛde kar rekɔ na saa polisifo yi kɔ yɛn akyi.
It still doesn’t get it.	Ɛda so ara nnya bi.
This has to go away.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi kɔ.
It’s still early days.	Ɛda so ara yɛ nna a edi kan.
This is nothing.	Eyi nyɛ hwee.
Drive the car carefully.	Ka kar no yiye.
I loved the book.	M’ani gyee nhoma no ho.
But he didn’t have to tell them what it was.	Nanso na enhia sɛ ɔka nea ɛyɛ kyerɛ wɔn.
He knew that.	Ná onim saa.
It is a city where everyone comes.	Ɛyɛ kurow a obiara ba mu.
I love all kinds of music.	M’ani gye nnwom ahorow nyinaa ho.
Try again, from a different direction.	Bɔ mmɔden bio, fi ɔkwan foforo so.
Several of them will be that age.	Wɔn mu dodow bi bɛyɛ saa mfe no.
For us, every user matters.	Yɛn fam no, obiara a ɔde di dwuma no ho hia.
He plays each game like it’s his last.	Ɔbɔ agoru biara te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nea etwa to.
I want to do it for you and take care of you.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ma wo na mehwɛ wo.
If that is what it is.	Sɛ ɛno ne nea ɛte a.
That’s my letter.	Ɛno ne me krataa.
Everyone talks about it and no one does anything about it.	Obiara ka ho asɛm na obiara nyɛ ho hwee.
Every year.	Afe biara.
But we are here.	Nanso yɛwɔ ha.
There are a few who will enjoy both.	Kakraa bi wɔ hɔ a wɔn ani begye abien no nyinaa ho.
That’s how the system works.	Saa na nhyehyɛe no yɛ adwuma.
It’s very important to him.	Ɛho hia no paa.
It had to be that way.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
No one ever tells me anything.	Obiara nka hwee nkyerɛ me da.
And it will be so.	Na ɛbɛyɛ saa.
When done right, it really works.	Sɛ wɔyɛ no yiye a, ɛyɛ adwuma ankasa.
We all go.	Yɛn nyinaa kɔ.
And we were happy.	Na yɛwɔ anigye.
I love that girl.	M’ani gye saa abeawa no ho.
However, this certainly is.	Nanso, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ saa.
Those things were too obvious.	Ná saa nneɛma no da adi dodo.
It’s very, very hard like that.	Ɛyɛ den yiye, ɛyɛ den yiye saa.
That everything was more beautiful.	Sɛ na biribiara yɛ fɛ sen saa.
People don’t understand how cold it was.	Nkurɔfo nte sɛnea na awɔw wom no ase.
For me, watching them is fun.	Wɔ me fam no, sɛ mehwɛ wɔn a, ɛyɛ anigye.
And it’s good that you have to.	Na eye sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
We were extremely weak.	Ná yɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
Nothing else worked.	Biribi foforo biara anyɛ adwuma.
He didn't know what was weird.	Ná onnim nea ɛyɛ nwonwa no.
I had to do it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
To connect with him.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɔne no bɛbɔ.
Or his hair.	Anaasɛ ne ti nhwi.
He wasn’t doing that.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa.
All or nothing.	Ne nyinaa anaasɛ biribiara nni hɔ.
All my books are there.	Me nhoma nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
Maybe I was just a random target.	Ebia na meyɛ obi a wɔde me ani asi me so kwa kɛkɛ.
What he liked, no one else liked.	Nea na n’ani gye ho no, na obiara ani nnye ho.
The vehicle was unlicensed.	Ná kar no nni tumi krataa.
I love working there.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ.
He has many friends and acquaintances.	Ɔwɔ nnamfo ne nnipa pii a onim wɔn.
I keep running, faster and faster.	Mekɔ so tu mmirika, ntɛmntɛm na ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
Give them some time.	Ma wɔn bere kakra.
It's just in a different direction.	Ɛwɔ ɔkwan foforo so ara kwa.
There is no money.	Sika biara nni hɔ.
You’ll be happy.	W’ani begye.
All faults are our own.	Mfomso nyinaa yɛ yɛn ankasa de.
But it seems too obvious.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛda adi dodo.
I want to bring our power to numbers.	Mepɛ sɛ mede yɛn tumi no ba dodow mu.
I felt weak.	Metee nka sɛ mayɛ mmerɛw.
Everything went well for me.	Biribiara kɔɔ yiye maa me.
It was in the mind.	Ná ɛwɔ adwene mu.
Thank you again, for everything.	Meda mo ase bio, wɔ biribiara ho.
People don’t just go out of their minds and it never becomes content.	Nkurɔfo mfi wɔn adwene mu ara kwa na ɛnyɛ nsɛm a ɛwɔ mu da.
At least he had done so.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na wayɛ saa.
I saw them.	Mihuu wɔn.
If possible, do something you enjoy doing.	Sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye a, yɛ biribi a w’ani gye ho sɛ wobɛyɛ.
Work is in progress.	Adwuma rekɔ so.
This doesn’t feel good.	Eyi nte nka sɛ ɛyɛ papa.
I know this applies to me.	Minim sɛ eyi fa me ho.
But people will always tell stories.	Nanso nkurɔfo bɛka nsɛm bere nyinaa.
He just sits there.	Ɔte hɔ ara kwa.
Over the years, a few people have become very famous.	Mfe pii a atwam no, nnipa kakraa bi agye din kɛse.
He slipped his hands together.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ mu.
It’s not the money.	Ɛnyɛ sika no.
Maybe more on that later.	Ebia ɛno ho nsɛm pii akyiri yi.
But if you like we can have dinner here tomorrow evening.	Nanso sɛ wopɛ a yebetumi adi anwummere aduan wɔ ha ɔkyena anwummere.
The material has too many problems.	Nsɛm no wɔ ɔhaw ahorow pii dodo.
I’m interested in sex.	M’ani gye nna ho.
I can’t do just one job.	Mintumi nyɛ adwuma biako pɛ.
There was a reason why.	Na biribi wɔ hɔ a enti.
It’s crowded with people.	Nnipa ahyɛ mu ma.
It mattered less about what it wasn’t than what it was.	Na ɛho nhia pii wɔ nea ɛnyɛ ho sen nea na ɛyɛ.
But only one.	Nanso biako pɛ.
There are few people left in the city.	Nnipa kakraa bi na aka wɔ kurow no mu.

These systems are not as up to date as they should be.	Saa nhyehyɛe ahorow yi nyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ nnɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no.
You have to go there with him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no kɔ hɔ.
Maybe you’ve done a little bit.	Ebia woayɛ kakra.
The statement said.	Asɛm no kae sɛ.
People are working on that.	Nkurɔfo reyɛ saa adwuma no ho adwuma.
Know that there is nothing wrong with you.	Hu sɛ mfomso biara nni wo ho.
I don’t know why that is.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
I only tell the truth.	Nokware no nkutoo na meka.
I thought you might like it.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia w’ani begye ho.

He didn't have to do that.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
He's doing what he's supposed to be doing.	Ɔreyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
But we can also solve the problem completely.	Nanso yebetumi adi ɔhaw no ho dwuma koraa nso.
But he wasn’t really in charge of us.	Nanso na onni yɛn so ankasa.
Which was good.	Nea na eye.
They talk about books.	Wɔka nhoma ahorow ho asɛm.
But it wasn’t what you thought.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ nea wususuw.
Maybe it will be.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I think he can help you.	Misusuw sɛ obetumi aboa wo.
Look after our children.	Hwɛ yɛn mma.
And what you can get, you don’t want.	Na nea wubetumi anya no, wompɛ.
It may not be popular.	Ebia ɛnyɛ nea agye din.
The room was filled with pictures.	Ná mfonini ahorow ahyɛ dan no mu ma.
He'll be pretty enough for a while now.	Ɔbɛyɛ fɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ bere tiaa bi mprempren.
Think about it from their perspective.	Susuw ho fi wɔn adwene mu.

I hope we can do it next year.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ yebetumi ayɛ no afe a edi hɔ no.
The moon is visible tonight.	Ɔsram no da adi anadwo yi.

You are not one of them.	Wonyɛ wɔn mu biako.
I think this year will be bigger and better than last.	Misusuw sɛ afe yi bɛyɛ kɛse na eye sen nea etwaam no.
It hurts a little more.	Ɛyɛ wo yaw kakra bio.
He doesn’t seem to want to give us any information.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde nsɛm biara bɛma yɛn.
This is the busy day.	Eyi ne da a adagyew nnim.
The details are fascinating.	Nsɛm no yɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
He didn't seem to care about her words.	Ɛte sɛ nea na ne nsɛm no mfa ne ho.
I’m interested in how this is going to turn out.	M’ani gye sɛnea eyi bɛkɔ so no ho.
So you can be just like me.	Enti wubetumi ayɛ te sɛ me ara.
For his part.	Wɔ ne fam no.
The words were true.	Ná nsɛm no yɛ nokware.

There was a lot of traffic.	Ná kar pii kɔ hɔ.

Some hot food.	Aduan a ɛyɛ hyew bi.
Treat yourself the best you can.	Fa wo ho di sɛnea eye sen biara.

He was sitting outside and we brought him inside.	Ná ɔte abɔnten na yɛde no baa mu.
I've thought about you a lot.	Madwene wo ho pii.
I have some of it.	Mewɔ bi.
However, this does not mean that there is nothing wrong with it.	Nanso, eyi nkyerɛ sɛ biribiara nni mu.
Maybe it was him.	Ebia na ɛyɛ no.
And he knew me.	Na na onim me.
He wants nothing to do with me.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔne me nni hwee yɛ.
I can use your help with this.	Metumi de mo mmoa no adi dwuma wɔ eyi mu.
I’m happy with mine.	M’ani gye me de no ho.
That will be the same.	Ɛno nso bɛyɛ saa ara.
Someone raised his head.	Obi maa ne ti so.
Sounds beautiful to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ ma me.
It’s really hot today.	Ɛyɛ hyew ankasa nnɛ.

This has important consequences.	Eyi de nneɛma a ɛho hia fi mu ba.
Any comments would be wrong.	Anka nsɛm biara a wɔka no bɛyɛ mfomso.
I had this same issue.	Ná mewɔ saa asɛm koro yi ara.
He was impressed with this.	N’ani gyee eyi ho.
He told her to stay with me.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ, tra me nkyɛn.
His table is very comfortable.	Ne pon no yɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
It had an interesting story.	Ná ɛwɔ asɛm bi a ɛyɛ anigye.
The setting was beautiful.	Ná tebea no yɛ fɛ yiye.
It might be for the best.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.

He had no friends there.	Ná onni nnamfo biara wɔ hɔ.
There was simply no time for that.	Ná bere nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ saa ara kwa.
He has done so.	Wayɛ saa.
It’s literally the same song.	Ɛyɛ dwom koro no ara ankasa.
He seemed harmless to me.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔnyɛ obi a ɔyɛ bɔne wɔ me fam.
To the best of my knowledge.	Sɛnea minim no yiye no.
He is a very friendly person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔpɛ nnipa yiye.
There was a man inside.	Ná ɔbarima bi wɔ mu.
It was too hard for her mother and father.	Ná ɛyɛ den dodo ma ne maame ne ne papa.
I didn’t even know anyone’s name in my room.	Ná minnim obiara din mpo wɔ me dan no mu.
Someone knocked on the door.	Obi bɔɔ ɔpon no mu.
He first takes one point.	Odi kan fa asɛm biako.
It was a really beautiful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
Do tell the story.	Yɛ ka kyerɛ.
I wish they would do that.	Me yam a anka wɔyɛ saa.
This is usually the case.	Mpɛn pii no, eyi te saa.
Do that a lot.	Yɛ saa pii.
He just hoped it wasn't him.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso ara kwa sɛ ɛnyɛ ɔno.
Sure, there were all those songs.	Ampa, na saa nnwom no nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
That was the case with me.	Saa na na ɛte wɔ me ho.
Believe me!	Gye me di!
It’s as simple as that.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ ɛno.
I wonder where he lives now.	Misusuw baabi a ɔte mprempren ho.
I think that’s what people forget.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne nea nkurɔfo werɛ fi.
He wrapped his arms around her.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne mu.
All the kids love you.	Mmofra no nyinaa pɛ wo.
The children looked on with hope.	Mmofra no de anidaso hwɛɛ.
But we are not interested in these issues.	Nanso yɛn ani nnye saa nsɛm yi ho.
But tomorrow he will.	Nanso ɔkyena ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I know no more about it than you do.	Minnim ho hwee sen sɛnea wunim no.
Nothing seems to matter much.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara ho nhia pii.
I can’t get out of there.	Mintumi mfi hɔ.
So, too soon now.	Enti, ntɛm dodo mprempren.
The people were beautiful.	Ná nkurɔfo no ho yɛ fɛ.
It’s been a long time.	Ɛyɛ bere tenten.
He is truly amazing.	Ɔyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
I don’t think that way.	Minsusuw saa kwan no ho.
I think he does it too much.	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛ no pii dodo.
But tell us about him.	Nanso ka ne ho asɛm kyerɛ yɛn.
His wish was not.	Ná nea ɔpɛ no nyɛ saa.
Let me get away for a while.	Ma me ho nkɔ kakra.
The dog watches everything we do.	Ɔkraman no hwɛ biribiara a yɛyɛ no.
She would do whatever he told her, no doubt.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ nea ɔbɛka akyerɛ no biara, akyinnye biara nni ho.
I have no control over the system.	Minni nhyehyɛe no so tumi biara.
That’s too bad.	Ɛno yɛ bɔne dodo.
If you don’t already know this you are backwards.	Sɛ wunnim eyi dedaw a wowɔ akyi kwan.
Do you know this guy.	So wunim saa ɔbarima yi.
That’s how he rules everyone.	Saa na odi obiara so.
And it was a job.	Na na ɛyɛ adwuma bi.
I just know it.	Minim ara kwa.
You almost had me there.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na wowɔ me wɔ hɔ.
I love this idea.	M’ani gye saa adwene yi ho.
He was just not tall.	Ná ɔnyɛ tenten ara kwa.
Our hope is in you.	Yɛn anidaso wɔ mo mu.
He has the best season ever here.	Ɔwɔ bere a eye sen biara wɔ ha pɛn.
What wonderful years. 	Mfe a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni. 
I may even have played with it a little too.	Ebia mpo mede adi agoru kakra nso.
I but he had the money himself.	Me nanso na ɔno ankasa na ɔwɔ sika no.
I want to touch it right now.	Mepɛ sɛ mede me nsa ka no mprempren ara.
It was what he wanted.	Ná ɛyɛ nea na ɔpɛ.
I know it was weird but it’s true.	Minim sɛ na ɛyɛ nwonwa nanso ɛyɛ nokware.
Someone else was in trouble.	Ná obi foforo nso wɔ ɔhaw mu.
I stepped inside.	Mede me nan sii mu.
I still have two hours left.	Meda so ara aka nnɔnhwerew abien.
Looks like we have a really awesome car today.	Ɛte sɛ nea yɛwɔ kar a ɛyɛ hu ankasa nnɛ.
I have been in a bit of a downward spiral over the last couple of days.	Mede me ho akɔ fam kakra wɔ nna abien a atwam no mu.
Many criticized his plans.	Nnipa pii kasa tiaa ne nhyehyɛe ahorow no.
But it is so.	Nanso ɛte saa.
I have done a few tests already.	Mayɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow kakraa bi dedaw.
The final test was easy.	Ná sɔhwɛ a etwa to no yɛ mmerɛw.
He loved the stories.	Ná n’ani gye nsɛm no ho.
It’s much more than that.	Ɛyɛ pii sen saa.
Everyone knows someone.	Obiara nim obi.
But he had some things to do.	Nanso na ɔwɔ nneɛma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
He needs to reach for the phone.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka telefon no.
Maybe there’s a reason for that.	Ebia biribi nti na ɛte saa.
Maybe it should have been.	Ebia anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
It had been a wild party.	Ná ayɛ apontow a ɛyɛ hu.
Driving can be dangerous.	Kar a wobɛka no betumi ayɛ asiane.
What they do with me doesn’t matter much.	Nea wɔde me yɛ no ho nhia pii.
However, it was cold.	Nanso, na awɔw wom.
Maybe you’ll be interested.	Ebia w’ani begye ho.
He was sitting alone in the front row.	Ná ɔno nkutoo te anim kwan no so.
Everyone went home happy.	Obiara de anigye kɔɔ fie.
You can’t keep walking across the same floor.	Worentumi nkɔ so nantew fa fam koro no ara so.
You’re a nice guy.	Wo ho yɛ anigye.
We have it so strong!.	Yɛwɔ no den paa!.
Put yourself in their shoes.	Fa wo ho hyɛ wɔn mpaboa mu.
I didn’t really want to know.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu ankasa.
I don’t know what to think.	Me nnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
If you don’t want to be friends with me, fine.	Sɛ wompɛ sɛ wo ne me fa nnamfo a, eye.
That was a lie.	Ná ɛno yɛ atoro.
I just love it.	M’ani gye ho ara kwa.
I can’t tell.	Mintumi nka.
Or do any work.	Anaasɛ yɛ adwuma biara.
But there must be another way.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan foforo wɔ hɔ.
That’s how it will be.	Ɛte saa sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ.
It will feel like this is your home.	Ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea eyi ne wo fie.
No one had much to say.	Ná obiara nni nsɛm pii a ɔbɛka.
I really got involved.	Mede me ho hyɛɛ mu ankasa.
The whole thing got me thinking.	Asɛm no nyinaa maa misusuw ho.
Cognitive work also remains the same.	Adwuma a wɔyɛ wɔ adwene mu nso da so ara yɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
You need to be wet.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ho yɛ nsu.
Don’t be one of them.	Mma wonyɛ wɔn mu biako.
I’m a mentally ill person.	M’adwene yɛɛ me yaw.
He worked on this for years.	Ɔyɛɛ eyi ho adwuma mfe pii.
I was so good at this.	Ná me ho akokwaw saa wɔ eyi mu.
Something has to go on.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi kɔ so tra hɔ.
Everyone believed it.	Obiara gye dii.
He knew what that was like.	Ná onim sɛnea ɛno te.
So you have this pain.	Enti wowɔ saa yaw yi.
This was a real situation for me.	Ná eyi yɛ tebea ankasa ma me.
And we do that.	Na yɛyɛ saa.
I did think it was a little strange.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra ampa.
But it’s still nothing.	Nanso ɛda so ara yɛ hwee.
He was very fond of her.	Ná n’ani gye ne ho paa.
We’re not happy.	Yɛn ani nnye.
I am going about it in a different way.	Mede ɔkwan foforo so rekɔ so.
The story is not good.	Asɛm no nyɛ papa.
As much as you can.	Sɛnea wubetumi biara.
Usually it was something simple.	Mpɛn pii no na ɛyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Quite a great situation.	Tebea kɛse koraa.
It was the best he could hope for, now.	Na ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara a obetumi ahwɛ kwan, mprempren.
Mine never seems to go away.	Ɛte sɛ nea me de no nkɔ da.
Maybe he would do that.	Ebia na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
People need to watch.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo hwɛ.
Tough.	Den.
As if it would be easy.	Te sɛ nea anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
They are not clear.	Wɔn mu nna hɔ.
It wasn’t very good, either.	Na ɛnyɛ papa koraa, nso.
Morning.	Anɔpa.
Little.	Kakra.
She smoothed her clothes.	Ɔde ne ntade no yɛɛ mmerɛw.
I don't have anything.	Minni hwee.
It looks perfect.	Ɛte sɛ nea edi mũ.
My wife, she loved that.	Me yere, n’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho.
Used and fully functional.	Wɔde adi dwuma na ɛyɛ adwuma koraa.
Just like the book.	Te sɛ nhoma no ara pɛ.
There was something .	Ná biribi wɔ hɔ .
I knew the girl.	Ná minim abeawa no.
Assume this is the case.	Fa no sɛ eyi te saa.
A very good idea.	Adwene pa koraa.
I still don’t understand them.	Meda so ara nte wɔn ase.
I believe you do.	Migye di sɛ woyɛ saa.
It is strange how many people see it.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛnea nnipa pii hu no.
I have to sleep.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda.
He is a beast.	Ɔyɛ aboa.
His speech was very popular.	Ná nkurɔfo ani gye ne kasa no ho kɛse.
This is easily my favorite story in the book.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ eyi bɛyɛ asɛm a m’ani gye ho kɛse wɔ nhoma no mu.
But his success shouldn’t really come as a surprise.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ odi yiye no yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
That doesn’t mean they were strong.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ na wɔyɛ den.
And going in it is.	Na kɔ mu no yɛ.
This is not really true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware ankasa.
You can’t do that.	Worentumi nyɛ saa.
However, it is still awesome.	Nanso, ɛda so ara yɛ hu.
I loved the characters for better and for worse.	Ná m’ani gye nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no ho yiye ne bɔne.
He makes beautiful statements.	Ɔyɛ nsɛm a ɛyɛ fɛ.
He drove into her.	Ɔde kar no kɔɔ ne mu.
No one knew where it was.	Ná obiara nnim baabi a ɛwɔ.
That’s just the way it is.	Ɛno ara ne nea ɛte.
The water was freshened daily.	Ná wɔyɛ nsu no foforo da biara.
No one is sitting there.	Obiara nte hɔ.
I remember him fondly.	Mede anigye kae no.
I see this.	Mihu eyi.
I agree with you.	Me ne wo yɛ adwene.
I know a lot of wonderful people.	Minim nnipa pii a wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa.
Everything was clear.	Ná biribiara mu da hɔ.
Anyway, here he is.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɔno ni.
I don’t know why that is.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
I never wanted to do this.	Na mempɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi da.
Now you have a problem.	Seesei wowɔ ɔhaw bi.
And it was a beautiful thing.	Na ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
You need to know how they talk about you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu sɛnea wɔka wo ho asɛm no.
And that’s not the same thing.	Na ɛno nyɛ ade koro.
No one knows what to do.	Obiara nnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
Children have it.	Mmofra wɔ bi.
What is important.	Nea ɛho hia.
This is important to me, kid.	Eyi ho hia me, abofra.
He was the kind of person who would do anything for you.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa a ɔbɛyɛ biribiara ama wo.
I can’t say I miss it even a little bit.	Mintumi nka sɛ mepa ho kyɛw kakra mpo.
More cars means more danger.	Kar pii kyerɛ asiane kɛse.
One was an animal.	Ná biako yɛ mmoa.
The very idea shocked me.	Adwene no ankasa maa me ho dwiriw me.
And it still does.	Na ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
It all looks good and works well.	Ne nyinaa hwɛ yiye na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
The action is really important.	Ade a wobɛyɛ no ho hia ankasa.
But it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛho nhia.
He is one of us.	Ɔyɛ yɛn mu biako.
But he was also happy.	Nanso na ɔwɔ anigye nso.
It’s one of the things.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma no mu biako.
There is too much going on.	Nneɛma pii rekɔ so dodo.
It definitely works, too.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma, nso.
People have to control something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo di biribi so.
I knew right then.	Ná minim saa bere no ara.
It is waterproof.	Ɛyɛ nea nsu ntumi nkɔ mu.
When it is cold, animals hibernate.	Sɛ awɔw wom a, mmoa da awɔw bere mu.
He loved where he was right now.	Ná n’ani gye baabi a ɔwɔ mprempren yi ara ho.
But a car didn’t do the job.	Nanso kar bi anyɛ adwuma no.
He was no longer working.	Ná ɔnyɛ adwuma bio.
I like that a lot.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho kɛse.
You want them to be competent and professional.	Wopɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nnipa a wɔn ho akokwaw na wɔyɛ adwuma yiye.
Think about what you’ve done!	Susuw nea woayɛ no ho!
This is not an easy task.	Eyi nyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Freshwater has been added to this list for two reasons.	Nneɛma abien nti na wɔde nsu pa aka saa din yi ho.
Will be on a diet soon.	Ɔbɛkɔ aduan bi so nnansa yi ara.
Outside the city.	Wɔ kurow no akyi.
And and this.	Na na eye.
He had no idea if this thing would work.	Ná onni adwene biara sɛ ebia saa ade yi bɛyɛ adwuma anaa.
He had no information.	Ná onni nsɛm biara.
I didn’t like this.	Ná m’ani nnye eyi ho.
Deal with it and see what this tells you.	Di ho dwuma na hwɛ nea eyi ka kyerɛ wo.
He has done some things himself.	Ɔno ankasa ayɛ nneɛma bi.
I felt alone and alone.	Metee nka sɛ me nkutoo na me nkutoo.
This is what he wants.	Eyi ne nea ɔpɛ.
Or something else, something simple.	Anaasɛ biribi foforo, biribi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
And it’s all from you.	Na ne nyinaa fi wo.
Everyone was impressed.	Obiara ani gyee ho.
I don’t know what he does with his money.	Minnim nea ɔde ne sika yɛ.
That was always important to me.	Ná ɛno ho hia me bere nyinaa.
Keep doing that.	Kɔ so yɛ saa.
It’s very good.	Ɛyɛ papa paa.
The stuff is nice and simple though.	Nneɛma no yɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ mmerɛw de, nanso.
Things just work and just work well.	Nneɛma yɛ adwuma ara kwa na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ara kwa.
Nothing could be further from the truth.	Biribiara ntumi nkɔ akyiri sen nokware no.
His father is important.	Ne papa ho hia.
He had nowhere else to go.	Ná onni baabi foforo a ɔbɛkɔ.
He wasn’t a big man.	Na ɔnyɛ ɔbarima kɛse.
I am a long-time employee.	Meyɛ obi a mede bere tenten ayɛ adwuma.
I know what is good now.	Minim nea eye mprempren.
But that’s not our job.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne yɛn adwuma.
Is that the case? 	So ɛte saa?

He made up his mind quickly.	Ɔyɛɛ n’adwene ntɛmntɛm.
So, even, they have their names.	Enti, mpo, wɔ wɔn din.
More details will follow along the way.	Nsɛm pii bɛka ho asɛm wɔ kwan so.
The walk outside.	Nantew no fi adi.
It’s not us being there.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn a yɛwɔ hɔ.
He's a bit of a narcissist.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔpɛ ne ho asɛm kakra.
You have to accept this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye eyi tom.
In every case, they all leaned forward.	Wɔ tebea biara mu no, wɔn nyinaa de wɔn ho too wɔn anim.
That was a lot of information.	Ná ɛno yɛ nsɛm pii.
Cast your mind back to the present and look again.	Fa adwene san kɔ mprempren na hwɛ bio.
In this study, we will do so.	Adesua yi mu no, yɛbɛyɛ saa.
But look at you.	Nanso hwɛ wo.
Maybe every day at any time.	Ebia da biara da bere biara.
I did what you said.	Meyɛɛ nea wokae no.
Just be careful.	Hwɛ yiye ara kwa.

Imagine where he could have gone then.	Susuw baabi a anka obetumi akɔ saa bere no ho hwɛ.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	Ná onim nea ɔreyɛ no yiye.

However, he knew he had to.	Nanso, na onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
You have to be strong.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ den.
It has all been too fast.	Ne nyinaa ayɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo.

He just focused on you.	Ɔde n’adwene sii wo so ara kwa.
Not too long ago.	Ɛnyɛ bere tenten ni dodo.

But it’s hard.	Nanso ɛyɛ den.
He could do what he had to do.	Ná obetumi ayɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
Every house tells a story.	Ofie biara ka asɛm bi.
I have no problem with that one.	Minni ɔhaw biara wɔ saa biako no ho.
This is your fault.	Eyi ne wo mfomso.
But this is not clear.	Nanso eyi mu nna hɔ.
This is not a happy situation.	Eyi nyɛ tebea a ɛyɛ anigye.
He had bad days.	Ná ɔwɔ nna bɔne.
Nothing else of interest at the meeting.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ nhyiam no ase.
I knew then what this was.	Saa bere no na minim nea eyi yɛ.
That feels important.	Ɛno te nka sɛ ɛho hia.
That’s how they do this thing, you know.	Saa na wɔyɛ saa ade yi, wunim.
That’s pretty clear now.	Ɛno mu da hɔ yiye mprempren.
Don’t get too excited.	Mma w’ani nnye ho dodo.
It’s their only chance.	Ɛyɛ wɔn hokwan biako pɛ.
Inside and out.	Wɔ mu ne akyi.
There is no need to do that.	Ɛho nhia sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Please continue to be that person.	Mesrɛ wo kɔ so nyɛ saa onipa no.
Here's everything he had to say.	Biribiara a na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka ni.
I can take you to them.	Metumi de wo akɔ wɔn nkyɛn.
However, not in an animal.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ aboa bi mu.
Two were new.	Ná abien yɛ foforo.
You are all cold anyway.	Mo nyinaa yɛ awɔw ɔkwan biara so.
I think you are one.	Misusuw sɛ woyɛ biako.
I don’t know what to tell you or do.	Minnim nea mɛka akyerɛ wo anaa meyɛ.
Not us, not me.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn, ɛnyɛ me.
This is obviously important.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi ho hia.
That means he understands.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ ɔte ase.
And if there is a way.	Na ɔkwan bi wɔ hɔ a.
He put people in danger.	Ɔde nkurɔfo too asiane mu.
It only half works.	Ɛyɛ fã pɛ na ɛyɛ adwuma.
I feel like something like that could be in the works.	Mete nka sɛ biribi a ɛte saa betumi aba nnwuma no mu.
But this may be the same.	Nanso ebia eyi nso te saa ara.
I can see you.	Metumi ahu wo.
It had been just one day.	Ná ayɛ da koro pɛ.
Something strange is going on around here.	Biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa rekɔ so wɔ ha ho.
Truth is the story now.	Nokware ne asɛm no mprempren.
We are the ones who are there now.	Yɛn na yɛwɔ hɔ mprempren.
It’s one thing or another.	Ɛyɛ ade biako anaa ade foforo.
Our child will be fine.	Yɛn ba no bɛyɛ yiye.
Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Ebia ɛnyɛ hwee.
This is certainly not a new story.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi nyɛ asɛm foforo.
This is for us alone.	Eyi yɛ yɛn nkutoo de.
I talk to him.	Me ne no kasa.
In the summer, the days are shorter.	Wɔ awɔw bere mu no, nna no yɛ tiaa.
We are happy to provide you with one.	Yɛn ani gye sɛ yɛde bi bɛma wo.
Finally, she brought the paper to class	Awiei koraa no, ɔde krataa no baa adesua mu
An only child at that.	Abofra koro pɛ wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
This is not a surprising statement.	Eyi nyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
The police asked me that.	Polisifo no bisaa me saa.
That’s pretty fast.	Ɛno yɛ ntɛmntɛm koraa.
I know you can see them too.	Minim sɛ wo nso wubetumi ahu wɔn.
My mother never said a word.	Me maame anka asɛm biara da.
I don’t want to hear this.	Mempɛ sɛ mete eyi.
That is the truth.	Ɛno ne nokware no.
I know what it’s like.	Minim sɛnea ɛte.
This room used to be my study.	Kan no na saa dan yi yɛ me adesua.
Take the matter seriously.	Fa asɛm no kɔ yiye.
It’s on me.	Ɛwɔ me so.
He would help anyone in need.	Ná ɔbɛboa obiara a ɔwɔ ɔhaw mu.
I had no intention of making you a good room.	Na minni adwene biara sɛ mɛyɛ wo dan pa.
His friends often talk about him.	Ne nnamfo taa ka ne ho asɛm.
I get this one.	Me nsa ka eyi.
He didn’t have the room.	Ná onni dan a ɔde bɛyɛ saa.
This seems to solve the problem.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi di ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
I loved being simple with my clothes.	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ mmerɛw wɔ me ntade ho.
I hope you enjoy the book.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye nhoma no ho.
They are amazing.	Wɔyɛ nwonwa.
Everyone was going.	Ná obiara rekɔ.
The stories were about people.	Ná nsɛm no fa nnipa ho.
He wasn't much better himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa nyɛ nea eye sen saa kɛse.
I did it very well.	Meyɛɛ no ​​yiye koraa.
We were at his house.	Ná yɛwɔ ne fie.
But it still doesn’t help.	Nanso ɛda so ara mmoa.
But this approach doesn’t seem to work.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea saa kwan yi nyɛ adwuma.
Let it be its fair game.	Ma ɛnyɛ ne kwan so agoru.
The situation gets worse over time.	Tebea no mu yɛ den bere a bere kɔ so no.
Slightly thicker as well, it feels less smooth.	Kakra a ɛyɛ den nso, ɛte nka sɛ ɛnyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
That is a lie.	Ɛno yɛ atoro.
And thought is something you see.	Na adwene yɛ biribi a wuhu.
It’s not that simple.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
That hurt him deeply.	Ɛno yɛɛ no ​​yaw kɛse.
He's pretty much passive about the whole thing.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔyɛ obi a ɔnyɛ hwee wɔ asɛm no nyinaa ho.
His first book.	Ne nhoma a edi kan.
Tell me again.	Ka kyerɛ me bio.
None of them really.	Wɔn mu biara ankasa.
We were only human beings.	Ná yɛyɛ nnipa nkutoo.
It was quite a wonderful story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
It was better to take the bus home.	Ná eye sɛ wode bɔs bɛkɔ fie.
I made a career out of it.	Meyɛɛ adwuma bi fii mu.
He had obviously touched many of them.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔde ne nsa aka wɔn mu pii.
Why is everyone making such a big deal about it?.	Dɛn nti na obiara reyɛ asɛm kɛse saa wɔ ho?.
The point, however, is that there is nothing wrong with it.	Nanso, asɛm no ne sɛ mfomso biara nni hɔ.
But there is a truth.	Nanso nokware bi wɔ hɔ.
I love this job.	M’ani gye saa adwuma yi ho.
So maybe this is new.	Enti ebia eyi yɛ foforo.
But that’s not what’s happening here.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha.
Still very difficult but it works.	Ɛda so ara yɛ den yiye nanso ɛyɛ adwuma.
He would go for walks with her during the day.	Ná ɔne no kɔ nantew awia.
Talk about resources.	Ka nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma ho asɛm.
So allow yourself to rely on it.	Enti ma kwan ma fa wo ho to so.
He wanted to get involved immediately.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu ntɛm ara.
But again, the picture, the picture is the same.	Nanso bio, mfonini no, mfonini no yɛ ade koro.
Thank you for those comments.	Meda mo ase wɔ saa nsɛm no ho.
Let it be one.	Ma ɛnyɛ biako.
No one seems to know what is going on.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara nnim nea ɛrekɔ so.
So he knew how to do it.	Enti na onim sɛnea ɔbɛyɛ.
This book is old.	Saa nhoma yi akyɛ.
I think back to those years.	Misusuw saa mfe no ho.
Many wonderful things have happened.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa pii asi.
It must be over now.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ aba awiei mprempren.
What a terrible story!	Asɛm a ɛyɛ hu bɛn ara ni!
This is often the case.	Eyi taa ba.
These buses are usually overcrowded.	Mpɛn pii no, nnipa ahyɛ bɔs ahorow yi mu ma dodo.
Look at how he is doing everything.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɔreyɛ biribiara.
It works really well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
Everyone great has gone.	Obiara a ɔyɛ kɛse no akɔ.
The item you just added does not exist.	Ade a wode aka ho seesei ara no nni hɔ.
They are interested in things.	Wɔn ani gye nneɛma ho.
There are better jobs.	Nnwuma a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ.
But it may not be.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
That’s another story.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo.
They don’t care if you’re a man.	Sɛ woyɛ ɔbarima a, ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm.
That’s not what it is.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea ɛyɛ.
But that would be ideal, that would be perfect.	Nanso ɛno bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara, ɛno bɛyɛ nea edi mũ.
You are doing much better.	Woreyɛ yiye kɛse.
And how close that is to the truth.	Na hwɛ sɛnea ɛno bɛn nokware no.
I just have to be careful.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye ara kwa.
We don’t like each other.	Yɛn ani nnye yɛn ho yɛn ho ho.
What are you doing today?	Dɛn na woreyɛ nnɛ?
You know all you need to know.	Wunim nea ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu nyinaa.
That will be his first job.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nea edi kan a ɔde bɛyɛ adwuma.
But it is so.	Nanso ɛte saa.
It seemed like a sore point.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ yaw.
Or it’s just me.	Anaasɛ ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
We don’t have to do anything tonight.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ hwee anadwo yi.
This paper will also discuss other species.	Saa krataa yi nso bɛka mmoa ahorow foforo ho asɛm.
People are happy here.	Nkurɔfo ani gye wɔ ha.
He put the book inside.	Ɔde nhoma no too mu.
His kind words hurt him.	Ne nsɛm pa no yɛɛ no ​​yaw.
I just want you to know.	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu ara kwa.
A long, long time ago.	Bere tenten, bere tenten a atwam ni.
And for the most part it’s been good.	Na fã kɛse no ara no ayɛ papa.
Maybe no one was good enough.	Ebia na obiara nyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
The reason for this is unclear.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no mu nna hɔ.
And it was this.	Na ɛyɛ eyi.
Certainly not!	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnte saa!
My father did nothing wrong.	Me papa anyɛ bɔne biara.
So he was a.	So na ɔyɛ.
Everything was as it should be.	Ná biribiara te sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
I felt his eyes on me.	Metee nka sɛ n’ani wɔ me so.
Two happy people.	Nnipa baanu a wɔn ani agye.
I need to know something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu biribi.
This turns the tide.	Eyi dan asɛm no.
This led to another busy, but enjoyable night.	Eyi maa anadwo foforo a adagyew nnim, nanso ɛyɛ anigye baa hɔ.
A busy day, he says.	Ɔka sɛ da a adagyew nnim.
This is not a good movie.	Eyi nyɛ sini pa.
A real picture, it was.	Mfonini ankasa, na ɛte saa.
However, there seems to be a problem.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
Walking the dog has never been so much fun!.	Nantew a ɔkraman no nyɛ anigye saa da!.
I think everyone should know that.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ obiara hu saa.
There are three of them.	Wɔn mu abiɛsa na ɛwɔ hɔ.
But you are a busy man.	Nanso woyɛ ɔbarima a onni adagyew.
New music in me but his.	Nnwom foforo wɔ me mu nanso ne de.
Not of the thing itself.	Ɛnyɛ ade no ankasa de.
That’s my nature.	Ɛno ne me su.
This could be the end.	Eyi betumi ayɛ awiei no.
It’s beautiful here.	Ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ ha.
Do not use too hot water.	Mfa nsu a ɛyɛ hyew dodo.
I knew this had to be them.	Ná minim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ wɔn.
I could see the situation so easily.	Ná metumi ahu tebea no ntɛmntɛm saa.
That’s probably about a week before the end of the year.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ bɛyɛ dapɛn biako ansa na afe no aba awiei.
Tom introduced his wife.	Tom de ne yere kyerɛɛ no.
Here in my house we seem to do this every week.	Me fie ha ɛte sɛ nea yɛyɛ eyi dapɛn biara.
You can’t hear much from him again.	Worentumi nte asɛm kɛse biara mfi ne hɔ bio.
This makes sex scarcer every year.	Eyi ma nna ho yɛ na afe biara.
It’s kind of a terrible idea.	Ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ hu bi.
The water was warm.	Ná nsu no mu yɛ hyew.
It’s a really good story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm pa ankasa.
I did it for your people too.	Meyɛɛ no ​​maa wo nkurɔfo nso.
The child looks up.	Abofra no ma n’ani so.
You can’t use them on their own.	Worentumi mfa wɔn nni dwuma wɔ wɔn ankasa so.
She loved her hair.	Ná n’ani gye ne ti nhwi ho.
I can 't say a word.	Mintumi 'ntumi nka asɛm bi.
I know their names.	Minim wɔn din.
Give it to me.	Ma me.
And maybe we can reach them.	Na ebia yebetumi adu wɔn nkyɛn.
These people are in a very tight spot.	Saa nkurɔfo yi wɔ baabi a ɛyɛ den yiye.
It’s also beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ nso.
However, it wasn’t with him.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ ne nkyɛn.
So they need money.	Enti sika ho hia wɔn.
While it is going on.	Bere a ɛrekɔ so.
All of this was at the door.	Ná eyi nyinaa wɔ ɔpon no ano.
But even he wasn't surprised.	Nanso na ɔno mpo anyɛ no nwonwa.
But it was true.	Nanso na ɛyɛ nokware.
I will give it to him that way.	Mede bɛma no saa.
In the latter case.	Wɔ asɛm a etwa to no mu no.
We owe this man.	Yɛde ɔbarima yi ka.
Quite a lot of money, as a matter of fact.	Sika pii koraa, sɛnea ɛte no.
We can help each other.	Yebetumi aboa yɛn ho yɛn ho.
We are worse than that.	Yɛyɛ bɔne sen saa.
There has to be a problem.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔhaw bi ba.
He has a strong face.	Ɔwɔ anim a ɛyɛ den.
This has always been a problem.	Eyi ayɛ ɔhaw bere nyinaa.
Not the day.	Ɛnyɛ da no.
It's just been too long.	Akyɛ dodo ara kwa.
He didn't want to but he had to.	Na ɔmpɛ nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
That doesn’t address anyone’s interests.	Ɛno mfa obiara anigye ho dwuma.
I couldn’t do it anymore.	Na mintumi nyɛ bio.
So was my hair.	Saa ara na na me ti nhwi nso te.
It’s such a strong team.	Ɛyɛ kuw a ɛyɛ den saa.
Neither of us knew what to say.	Ná yɛn mu biara nnim nea ɔbɛka.
I think that’s beautiful.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ fɛ.
Maybe not before two or three, depending on how things are going.	Ebia ɛnyɛ ansa na abien anaa abiɛsa, sɛnea nneɛma rekɔ so no.
Most of his people were drowned.	Nsu faa ne nkurɔfo dodow no ara.
Important things were happening.	Ná nneɛma a ɛho hia rekɔ so.
He had plenty of time.	Ná ɔwɔ bere pii.
But it was three.	Nanso na ɛyɛ abiɛsa.
People use it for good or for bad.	Nkurɔfo de di dwuma de yɛ nneɛma pa anaa nneɛma bɔne.
We can keep doing that.	Yebetumi akɔ so ayɛ saa.
Even that was unrealistic.	Ná ɛno mpo nyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
Or in this case.	Anaasɛ wɔ eyi mu.
Just take me back.	Fa me san kɔ kɛkɛ.
You’re strong.	Woyɛ den.
I thought about this.	Misusuw eyi ho.
Please don't say anything to him.	Mesrɛ wo, nka asɛm biara nkyerɛ no.
But maybe he did.	Nanso ebia ɔyɛɛ saa.
I hope yours goes much better.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo de no bɛkɔ yiye kɛse.
It feels almost like being at home.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte nka sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ fie no.
That is our only hope.	Ɛno nkutoo ne yɛn anidaso.
Everyone knows everyone’s business here too.	Obiara nim obiara adwuma wɔ ha nso.
Just try and keep going.	Bɔ mmɔden kɛkɛ na kɔ so.
There was no way he could prove that.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ a na obetumi akyerɛ saa.
Everyone did know.	Ná obiara nim ampa.
An omnivorous dog is a very greedy animal.	Ɔkraman a odi biribiara yɛ aboa a ɔpɛ ade kɛse.
People couldn’t do their jobs.	Nkurɔfo antumi anyɛ wɔn adwuma.
He really had to use my name.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde me din di dwuma ankasa.
It’s so important.	Ɛho hia saa.
Get involved in any way at all.	Fa wo ho hyɛ ɔkwan biara so koraa.
He would have liked that.	Anka n’ani begye saa asɛm no ho.
However, not today.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nnɛ.
Just the first one.	Nea edi kan no ara kwa.
to rather than be.	to sen sɛ ɛbɛyɛ.
The cast is impeccable.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ sini no yɛ nea mfomso biara nni ho.
Most of the problem lies with the tee again.	Ɔhaw no mu dodow no ara da tee no so bio.
One factor is age.	Ade biako a ɛwɔ mu ne mfe a obi adi.
He worked very long hours.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma nnɔnhwerew pii paa.
There is nothing more important.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛho hia sen saa.
The whole season should be good, hopefully.	Ɛsɛ sɛ bere mũ no nyinaa yɛ papa, anidaso wom.
We know each other by name.	Yɛde din hu yɛn ho yɛn ho.
There are lots, lots, and lots of interesting things.	Nneɛma pii, pii, ne nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ hɔ.
Don’t drive too fast!	Mma kar nkɔ ntɛmntɛm dodo!
For this, you can do a number of things.	Eyi nti, wubetumi ayɛ nneɛma ahorow bi.
I understand it very well.	Mete ase yiye.
We had enough of it.	Ná yɛwɔ nea ɛdɔɔso.
I think that did speak for me.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno kaa me ho asɛm ampa.
The street was almost empty.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na obiara nni abɔnten so.
But he wasn’t at all.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ saa koraa.
Not that there was anything he could do about it.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na biribi wɔ hɔ a obetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
They are the same thing.	Wɔyɛ ade koro.
That is the most important thing.	Ɛno ne ade a ɛho hia sen biara.
But look at them.	Nanso hwɛ wɔn.
Most people move into jobs.	Nnipa dodow no ara tu kɔ nnwuma mu.
Again, this is true.	Bio nso, eyi yɛ nokware.
It would have been beautiful.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
The meeting lasted about two and a half hours.	Nhyiam no dii bɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abien ne fã.
Easy money in the game's content.	Sika a ɛyɛ mmerɛw wɔ agoru no mu nsɛm mu.
Run the experiment for two years.	Fa sɔhwɛ no tu mmirika mfe abien.
I really like it when he uses his hands.	M’ani gye ho yiye bere a ɔde ne nsa di dwuma no.
A great man.	Onipa kɛse.
He can do whatever he wants.	Obetumi ayɛ nea ɔpɛ biara.
It has been like that for a while.	Ɛte saa bere tiaa bi ni.
I think people understand then.	Misusuw sɛ nkurɔfo te ase saa bere no.
The music kept playing.	Nnwom no kɔɔ so bɔɔ.
I couldn’t imagine it.	Na mintumi nsusuw ho.
This is a very difficult task to do.	Eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ.
It’s the first time in a group of animals.	Ɛyɛ bere a edi kan wɔ mmoa kuw bi mu.
The background planning going on at this point is terrible.	Akyi nhyehyɛe a ɛrekɔ so wɔ saa bere yi mu no yɛ hu.
He leaned in closer.	Ɔde ne ho too mu bɛn no kɛse.
And in a way, it’s all the more beautiful for her.	Na ɔkwan bi so no, ɛyɛ fɛ kɛse ma no.
But not my people.	Nanso ɛnyɛ me nkurɔfo.
If you like it, keep an eye on it.	Sɛ w’ani gye ho a, hwɛ so yiye.
These shoes look old.	Saa mpaboa yi te sɛ nea akyɛ.
Pictures, that sort of thing.	Mfonini ahorow, saa ade no.
All of that would take days.	Ná ɛno nyinaa begye nna pii.
However, I don't really know how to do this.	Nanso, minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ eyi ankasa.
I don’t know, not that I’m one.	Minnim, ɛnyɛ sɛ meyɛ biako.
He does nothing for me.	Ɔnyɛ hwee mma me.
But that’s about it.	Nanso ɛno fa ho.
That was a very important moment.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere a ɛho hia yiye paa.
Don’t give him anything.	Mma no hwee.
I’m proud of our team.	M’ani agye yɛn kuw no ho.
He didn’t want me.	Ná ɔmpɛ me.
Just go to him next time well.	Kɔ ne nkyɛn kɛkɛ bere foforo no yiye.
Not with him, that’s for sure.	Ɛnyɛ ne nkyɛn, ɛno yɛ nokware.
Things are thing and things.	Nneɛma yɛ ade ne nneɛma.
Had a great night sleep.	Na ɔwɔ nna kɛse anadwo nna.
I had to make myself better.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ me ho yiye.
We do it every day.	Yɛyɛ no da biara da.
The mood is not good.	Adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ no nyɛ papa.
It certainly seemed likely.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛte sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
We can’t go tonight, or tomorrow.	Yɛrentumi nkɔ anadwo yi, anaa ɔkyena.
That’s how it’s supposed to work.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
He always tells me.	Ɔka kyerɛ me bere nyinaa.
I think that could be something you’d like.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno betumi ayɛ biribi a w’ani begye ho.
You may also be just doing it wrong.	Ebia woreyɛ no bɔne ara kwa nso.
The price has dropped again.	Bo no akɔ fam bio.
I was amazed at him.	Me ho dwiriw me wɔ ne ho.
I can’t win with him.	Me ne no ntumi nni nkonim.
If he had, he would have been set up for life.	Sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa a, anka wɔde no besi hɔ ama nkwa.
And feel terribly bad.	Na te nka sɛ woayɛ bɔne a ɛyɛ hu.
Like many of them too.	Te sɛ wɔn mu pii nso.
Is this just as good.	So eyi yɛ papa saa ara.
This picture conveys the idea.	Saa mfonini yi da adwene no adi.
But it was quick.	Nanso na ɛyɛ ntɛm.
I think most of them are human.	Misusuw sɛ wɔn mu dodow no ara yɛ nnipa.
Towards the end, it was obvious there were issues.	Ɛrekɔ awiei no, na ɛda adi sɛ na nsɛm bi wɔ hɔ.
Either of our varieties would have worked.	Anka yɛn ahorow no mu biara bɛyɛ adwuma.
To make you feel better.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
The water is brought.	Wɔde nsu no ba.
Nor does he even seem to know who his friends are.	Saa ara nso na ɛte sɛ nea onnim wɔn a wɔyɛ ne nnamfo mpo.
He can figure out what to do about it.	Obetumi ahu nea ɔbɛyɛ wɔ ho.
He looks like a nice guy.	Ɔte sɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He is very sensitive.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔte nka kɛse.
Any time at all.	Bere biara koraa.
But deliver us from evil.	Nanso gye yɛn fi bɔne mu.
You speak many languages ​​fluently.	Woka kasa ahorow pii yiye.
His head, too big.	Ne ti, kɛse dodo.
I put this aside last year.	Mede eyi too nkyɛn afe a etwaam no.
I could do that part.	Ná metumi ayɛ saa fã no.
Maybe it was once that.	Ebia bere bi na ɛte saa.
You have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
Keep things moving.	Ma nneɛma nkɔ so.
You want to be a man.	Wopɛ sɛ woyɛ ɔbarima.
I need to talk to him now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa mprempren.
And it was nothing.	Na na ɛnyɛ hwee.
Not for a moment did it seem real to me.	Ɛnyɛ bere tiaa bi mpo na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware ankasa wɔ me fam.
One more day.	Da koro bio.
Just introduce yourself.	Fa wo ho kyerɛ kɛkɛ.
Not as hard as it should be.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no.
Like this house.	Te sɛ ofie yi.
I don’t like you.	M’ani nnye wo ho.
This was not home.	Ná eyi nyɛ fie.
He leaned against the door.	Ɔde ne ho too ɔpon no ano.
A little too good.	Kakra a eye dodo.
None of them went to him.	Wɔn mu biara ankɔ ne nkyɛn.
He didn't want to be impressed.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ n’ani gye ne ho.
I'm at home.	Mewɔ fie.
The house was full of books.	Ná nhoma ahyɛ ofie hɔ ma.
I hope someone can help.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ obi betumi aboa.
I really thought we had something for them today.	Misusuwii ankasa sɛ yɛwɔ biribi ma wɔn nnɛ.
What a great thrill that is.	Hwɛ anigye kɛse a ɛte saa.
He is a human being.	Ɔyɛ onipa.
You have to act.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ agoru.
We are human beings.	Yɛyɛ nnipa.
I still had work to do.	Ná meda so ara wɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
There would be more tomorrow and the day after.	Anka pii bɛba ɔkyena ne da a edi hɔ no.
All the rumors are false.	Nsɛm a wɔka no nyinaa yɛ atoro.
All the products are of the highest quality.	Nneɛma no nyinaa yɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ papa sen biara.
Nor is it practical.	Saa ara nso na ɛnyɛ nea wɔde di dwuma.
Most of these people need it more than I do.	Saa nnipa yi mu dodow no ara hia no kɛse sen me.
Please show me how to do this.	Mesrɛ mo, kyerɛ me sɛnea mɛyɛ eyi.
I heard that too.	Me nso metee saa asɛm no.
Maybe that’s what he really was.	Ebia saa na na ɔte ankasa.
They are far worse than you know or even think.	Wɔyɛ bɔne koraa sen sɛnea wunim anaasɛ wususuw mpo.
Even so, he actually has a point.	Ɛno mpo no, ɔwɔ asɛm bi ankasa.
To use this feature.	Sɛ wode saa ade yi bedi dwuma a.
I'm talking about you.	Me ne wo ho asɛm.
He just doesn’t know.	Ɔno ara na onnim.
I’ve always admired him.	M’ani gye ne ho bere nyinaa.
Testing needs time.	Sɔhwɛ hia bere.
It may be true.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ nokware.
This is great for them.	Eyi yɛ kɛse ma wɔn.
There was nothing my mom could do about it anyway.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a me maame betumi ayɛ wɔ ho ɔkwan biara so.
We can have it, after that.	Yebetumi anya bi, ɛno akyi no.
I can't believe he's doing this to you.	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɔreyɛ wo eyi.
And the work that it does.	Na adwuma a ɛyɛ.
I have to live with the story for a while.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne asɛm no tra ase kakra.
I had a house there.	Ná mewɔ ofie wɔ hɔ.
What you need to do is.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ne sɛ.
Maybe to keep me busy.	Ebia sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a mɛkɔ so ayɛ adwuma.
A man no one really knows.	Ɔbarima a obiara nnim no ankasa.
I wanted my life back.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me nkwa san ba.
It’s not the point.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ asɛm no mu.
So, it matters to him.	Enti, ɛho hia no.
The same is true of books.	Saa ara na nhoma nso te.
and you can see it is easy enough.	na wubetumi ahu sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
The work comes first.	Adwuma no na edi kan.
There is no additional cost.	Ɛho ka foforo biara nni hɔ.
Someone plays some low-pitched music.	Obi bɔ nnwom bi a ɛyɛ den kakraa bi.
And another test.	Na sɔhwɛ foforo nso.
The party was a lot of fun.	Ná apontow no yɛ anigye kɛse.
He was a very strong presence.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔwɔ hɔ a ɔyɛ den yiye.
He worked for both of them.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma maa wɔn baanu nyinaa.
I have that chill in the back of my head now.	Mewɔ saa awɔw no wɔ me ti akyi mprempren.
That’s the other person.	Ɛno ne onipa foforo no.
Late last year.	Afe a etwaam no awiei.
There are no police officers.	Polisifo biara nni hɔ.
They were shocked.	Wɔn ho dwiriw wɔn.
Animals cannot say such things.	Mmoa ntumi nka nsɛm a ɛte saa.
It was like being a kid again.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea meyɛ abofra bio.
He ran his hand through his hair.	Ɔde ne nsa faa ne ti nhwi mu.
And it will be so.	Na ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Maybe it was even true.	Ebia na ɛyɛ nokware mpo.
In our midst.	Yɛn mu.
You’ll be interested in the story.	W’ani begye asɛm no ho.
This will be your room.	Eyi bɛyɛ wo dan.
They are very real.	Wɔyɛ nnipa ankasa paa.
He covered most of the issues.	Ná ɔka nsɛm dodow no ara ho asɛm.
My mom is very busy right now.	Me maame nni adagyew koraa mprempren.
I hope it was good for you too.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ na eye maa wo nso.
You have absolute power.	Wowɔ tumi koraa.
I’m very impressed with them.	M’ani gye wɔn ho yiye.
You are not a weakling.	Wonyɛ obi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw.
It’s too dangerous now.	Ɛyɛ asiane dodo mprempren.
Anyway, that’s the job.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛno ne adwuma no.
But many of them turn away.	Nanso wɔn mu pii san wɔn akyi.
I'd better go now.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ mekɔ mprempren.
Other than that, it was just another day.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, na ɛyɛ da foforo ara kwa.
This bike is fully equipped with treadmills.	Wɔde nneɛma a wɔde tu mmirika ahyɛ sakre yi mu koraa.
I couldn’t see very well.	Na mintumi nhu ade yiye koraa.
Everyone does this.	Nnipa nyinaa yɛ eyi.
For this view.	Wɔ saa adwene yi ho.
He was a good guy.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa.
But it’s not too busy.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adagyew dodo.
Feeling superimposed.	Te nka sɛ wɔde ahyɛ so.
She wants another child, and that’s it.	Ɔpɛ abofra foforo, na ɛno ne no.
We use it, or part of it, every day.	Yɛde di dwuma, anaa ne fã bi, da biara da.
He was a big man, and he was strong.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse, na na ne ho yɛ den nso.
Every business started with an idea.	Adwuma biara fii ase de adwene bi.
But the next time he was with her.	Nanso bere foforo mu no na ɔwɔ ne nkyɛn.
You never know what you can pick up.	Wunnim nea wubetumi agye da.
The same is true of this work.	Saa ara na saa adwuma yi te.
He would do that.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I have to do more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ pii.
There is a great deal to be done.	Ade kɛse bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
But there was no time for that.	Nanso na bere biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ saa.
But also books.	Nanso nhoma ahorow nso.
It is a commonly known.	Ɛyɛ nea nnipa pii nim.
I was just doing that.	Ná meyɛ saa ara kwa.
The new year had begun.	Ná afe foforo no afi ase.
He had a powerful mind.	Ná ɔwɔ adwene a tumi wom.
There are many different types of music.	Nnwom ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
You are truly beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ ampa.
It’s just a girl.	Ɛyɛ abeawa bi nkutoo.
But it’s not really a big deal.	Nanso ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse ankasa.
There is no easy task.	Adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw biara nni hɔ.
That took resources.	Ɛno gyee nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma.
Generally, it works well.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
I don’t know what they are.	Minnim nea wɔyɛ.
I really like this story.	M’ani gye saa asɛm yi ho paa.
I rule in his name.	Mede ne din na edi tumi.
But look deeper.	Nanso hwɛ mu kɔ akyiri.
Last year has been a great year.	Afe a atwam no ayɛ afe kɛse.
I couldn’t believe that.	Ná mintumi nnye saa asɛm no nni.
See how they are driving.	Hwɛ sɛnea wɔde kar rekɔ.
His hands were warm and strong.	Ná ne nsa yɛ hyew na ɛyɛ den.
More people speak this language than any other.	Nnipa pii ka saa kasa yi sen kasa foforo biara.
There are many of them.	Wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
The kids loved it.	Mmofra ani gyee ho.
I don’t know anything about this.	Minnim eyi ho hwee.
Music has been played in this room for hours.	Wɔde nnɔnhwerew pii abɔ nnwom wɔ dan yi mu.
All we can do is hope.	Nea yebetumi ayɛ ara ne anidaso.
Maybe he'll drive by that night, just check it out.	Ebia ɔbɛka kar akɔ hɔ saa anadwo no, ahwɛ mu kɛkɛ.
If he wants to do something he does.	Sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi a ɔyɛ.
Our plans are.	Yɛn nhyehyɛe ahorow no.
I really like the power system.	M’ani gye tumi nhyehyɛe no ho ankasa.
Further study is needed.	Adesua foforo ho hia.
The results have been positive.	Nea afi mu aba no ayɛ papa.
That doesn’t matter.	Ɛno mfa ho.
Great job, though.	Nanso, adwuma kɛse.
Or feel something about it.	Anaasɛ te biribi nka wɔ ho.
I'll go home too.	Me nso mɛkɔ fie.
Where are we going with this?.	Ɛhe na yɛde eyi rekɔ?.
On the water.	Wɔ nsu no so.
And no one ever saw that.	Na obiara anhu saa da.
Not that he wanted her anymore, he didn't.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɔpɛ no bio, na ɔmpɛ.
He was excited.	Ná n’ani agye.
I don’t like lying.	M’ani nnye atoro ho.
But don’t be honest with them.	Nanso mma wo nni nokware mma wɔn.
He had a gun.	Ná ɔwɔ tuo.
They both went out.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa fii adi.
I don’t think he did.	Minsusuw sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
That’s not a problem.	Ɛno nyɛ ɔhaw.
Except, it doesn’t.	Gye sɛ, ɛnyɛ saa.
How you’re doing it.	Sɛnea woreyɛ.
But there was nothing in their minds.	Nanso na biribiara nni wɔn adwene mu.
There is no such case in the literature.	Asɛm a ɛte saa biara nni nhoma ahorow mu.
I want to know about that one.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu saa obi no ho asɛm.
I think everyone recognizes that.	Misusuw sɛ obiara hu saa.
He took the test.	Ɔyɛɛ sɔhwɛ no.
I’d love to stay up all night.	M’ani begye sɛ mɛkɔ so ayɛ adwuma anadwo mũ no nyinaa.
He was a strong man.	Ná ne ho yɛ den.
That kid is beautiful.	Saa abofra no ho yɛ fɛ.
It was a daunting task at such a time.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ hu wɔ bere a ɛte saa mu.
There is nothing we can do with him.	Biribiara nni hɔ a yebetumi ne no ayɛ.
They weren’t much interested anymore.	Ná wɔn ani nnye ho pii bio.
I think he’ll like it.	Misusuw sɛ n’ani begye ho.
John attended the meeting.	John kɔɔ nhyiam no ase.
There were very few.	Ná kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
They are very complex.	Wɔyɛ nea ɛyɛ den yiye.
Don’t use it.	Mfa nni dwuma.
She is my wife.	Ɔyɛ me yere.
That’s a good day.	Ɛno yɛ da pa.
This gave way to his playful hand.	Eyi maa ne nsa a ɔde dii agoru no nyaa kwan.
His hands were strong but soft.	Ná ne nsa yɛ den nanso na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
And the girl, too.	Na abeawa no nso.
As you wish.	Sɛnea wopɛ.
So the story follows.	Enti asɛm no di akyi.
That is true enough.	Ɛno yɛ nokware a ɛdɔɔso.
However, there was a bit of a problem.	Nanso, na ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ kakra.
It’s just not realistic for everyone.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware ara kwa mma obiara.
Here’s what you need to do.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ni.
He looked like the first one.	Ná ɔte sɛ nea odi kan no.
Here is your new home.	Wo fie foforo no ni.
There are reasons for optimism on that front.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ yɛwɔ anidaso wɔ saa anim no.
The thing that is given to him.	Ade a wɔde ma no.
And tell people good things.	Na ka nsɛm pa kyerɛ nkurɔfo.
I saw what was going on.	Mihuu nea ɛrekɔ so no.
In the end, it really doesn’t matter.	Awiei koraa no, ɛnyɛ hwee ankasa.
I wanted it to be better.	Ná mepɛ sɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ papa.
This is the kind of approach.	Eyi ne ɔkwan a ɛte saa.
I want to keep posting that.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so de saa asɛm no to so.
I know exactly what you mean.	Minim nea wopɛ sɛ woka no yiye.
Reviews can be positive or negative.	Nneɛma a wɔka fa ho no betumi ayɛ nea eye anaasɛ ɛyɛ bɔne.
That’s all anyone ever sees.	Ɛno ara ne nea obiara hu pɛn.
I never knew my father.	Minnim me papa da.
They had all passed away. 	Ná wɔn nyinaa atwam. 
something else must be going on.	ɛbɛyɛ sɛ biribi foforo rekɔ so.
Not for any reason.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara nti.
Supplies may be temporary only.	Ebia nneɛma a wɔde bɛma no bɛyɛ bere tiaa bi nkutoo.
You use a lot of information to do that.	Wode nsɛm pii di dwuma de yɛ saa.
Whatever he wanted, he would give it to her.	Biribiara a ɔpɛ no, na ɔde bɛma no.
Maybe he would go.	Ebia na ɔbɛkɔ.
This has been done for years.	Wɔde mfe pii ayɛ eyi.
But that would take time and money.	Nanso na ɛno begye bere ne sika.
The children also forgot their father.	Mmofra no nso werɛ fii wɔn papa.
It will be a fun and challenging learning experience.	Ɛbɛyɛ anigye ne adesua a ɛyɛ den.
It’s better if it doesn’t matter.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
A lot of people trust me.	Nnipa pii de wɔn ho to me so.
I want to see how a game plays.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea agoru bi di.
This was going to end badly.	Ná eyi bɛba awiei bɔne.
Do it for everyone later.	Yɛ no ma obiara akyiri yi.
It didn't feel hard to touch.	Ná ɛnte nka sɛ ɛyɛ den sɛ wode wo nsa bɛka.
Include only what is necessary.	Fa nea ɛho hia nkutoo ka ho.
So we have a nice place in that way.	Enti yɛwɔ baabi a ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ saa kwan no so.
He made his way out.	Ɔyɛɛ ne kwan fii adi.
One of the most challenging.	Nea ɛyɛ den sen biara no mu biako.
You’ve done that before.	Woayɛ saa pɛn.
He will tell you the same thing.	Ɔbɛka asɛm koro no ara akyerɛ wo.
There are still many things you do not know.	Nneɛma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a wunnim.
This film manages to do all of that.	Saa sini yi tumi yɛ saa nneɛma no nyinaa.
The same is true.	Saa ara na ɛte.
I don't know where he might be.	Minnim baabi a ebia ɔwɔ.
He was a free man now.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa a ɔde ne ho mprempren.
You know, it doesn’t have to be.	Wunim, enhia sɛ ɛte saa.
His home was gone.	Ná ne fie nni hɔ bio.
This is not really a good idea.	Eyi nyɛ adwene pa ankasa.
Or he thought he had.	Anaasɛ na osusuw sɛ ɔwɔ bi.
I thought it didn’t matter.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛho nhia biara.
No one could say what had happened.	Obiara antumi anka nea asi no.
It all came down to this next game.	Ne nyinaa baa agoru a edi hɔ yi so.
As a result, you can expect this to be a good course.	Ne saa nti, wubetumi ahwɛ kwan sɛ eyi bɛyɛ adesua pa.
How can we move forward?.	Yɛbɛyɛ dɛn akɔ yɛn anim?.
I knew it.	Ná minim.
This is great if you have kids at home.	Eyi yɛ kɛse sɛ wowɔ mma wɔ fie a.
Movies prove that.	Sini da no adi sɛ ɛte saa.
For hours at night.	Anadwo nnɔnhwerew pii.
Many people do not use this.	Nnipa pii mfa eyi nni dwuma.
And start walking.	Na fi ase nantew.
Keep yourself strong.	Kɔ so ma wo ho nyɛ den.
I’ve always admired him, as everyone should.	M’ani gye ne ho bere nyinaa, sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ obiara yɛ no.
That sounds a bit odd, perhaps.	Ɛno te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra, ebia.
His story shocked me.	Ne asɛm no maa me ho dwiriw me.
The water was warm this morning.	Ná nsu no mu yɛ hyew anɔpa yi.
That was important.	Ná ɛno ho hia.
See photos of these events below.	Hwɛ nsɛm yi ho mfonini ahorow a ɛwɔ ase ha no.
I'm yours and mine.	Me ne wo de.
Mostly the first two.	Dodow no ara yɛ abien a edi kan no.
None of this is true.	Eyi mu biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nokware.
Put it this way.	Fa ka no saa kwan yi so.
I still find it to be true.	Meda so ara hu sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
Everything in me ached.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ me mu no yɛɛ me yaw.
Music is almost universal	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nnwom yɛ ade a ɛwɔ nnipa nyinaa mu
Keep up the good work!.	Kɔ so yɛ nea woreyɛ no!.
It hardly mattered.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛho nhia.
He looks quite childish.	Ɔte sɛ abofra koraa.
He had done so much.	Ná wayɛ pii saa.
No one could see him, but he couldn’t see anyone either.	Obiara antumi anhu no, nanso na ɔno nso antumi anhu obiara.
Maybe he’s here.	Ebia ɔwɔ ha.
The bus was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ bɔs no mu ma.
But he didn't know why.	Nanso na onnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Remember that this is only important for your important systems.	Kae sɛ eyi ho hia ma wo nhyehyɛe ahorow a ɛho hia no nkutoo.
Just one of you.	Mo mu biako pɛ.
Start with a book or two.	Fa nhoma biako anaa abien fi ase.
It all went well.	Ne nyinaa dii yiye.
This is certainly not the case.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi nte saa.
Maybe there’s another one out there.	Ebia foforo bi wɔ hɔ wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
Not much time.	Ɛnyɛ bere pii.
Or at least that’s what you tell yourself.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne nea woka kyerɛ wo ho.
This would be difficult.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ den.
And yet.	Na nanso.
He didn’t have to make up his mind.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔyɛ n’adwene.
Most of the work is done by hand.	Wɔde nsa na ɛyɛ adwuma no fã kɛse no ara.
That may be going a little too far.	Ebia ɛno rekɔ akyiri kakra.
Not that it matters though.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛho hia nanso.
Either way, it is safe.	Ɔkwan biara so no, asiane nnim.
Both had seen years of use but worked extremely well.	Ná abien no nyinaa ahu sɛ wɔde adi dwuma mfe pii nanso na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
I really enjoyed the whole game and kind of miss it.	M’ani gyee agoru no nyinaa ho ankasa na ɔkwan bi so no, mepa ho kyɛw.
For a long time, many people did not know.	Bere tenten no, na nnipa pii nnim.
No one leaves voluntarily.	Obiara mfi ne pɛ mu mfi hɔ.
That was his nature.	Ná ɛno ne ne su.
It either exists or it doesn’t.	Ɛwɔ hɔ anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
He treated the dog badly.	Ɔne ɔkraman no dii no bɔne.
Some of the children may succeed without their father.	Mmofra no bi betumi adi yiye a wɔn papa nka ho.
This was new to me.	Ná eyi yɛ ade foforo ma me.
Let me work on it.	Ma menyɛ ho adwuma.
So much for that.	Enti pii ma ɛno.
In either case, you do it right.	Wɔ tebea abien no nyinaa mu no, woyɛ no yiye.
I only use this product.	Saa ade yi nkutoo na mede di dwuma.
It is as true as it was many years ago.	Ɛyɛ nokware te sɛ nea na ɛte mfe pii a atwam ni no.
This was extremely rare.	Ná eyi ho yɛ na koraa.
Those things can be dangerous.	Saa nneɛma no betumi ayɛ nea asiane wom.
He had a moment that still stayed on the road.	Ná ɔwɔ bere tiaa bi a ɛda so ara traa kwan no so.
And it was good for them.	Na eye ma wɔn.
Not really good.	Ɛnyɛ nea eye ankasa.
I thought he would go.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔbɛkɔ.
Never mention it if you can.	Sɛ wubetumi a, nka ho asɛm da.
Let it be your way.	Ma ɛnyɛ wo kwan so.
It’s a famous bridge.	Ɛyɛ abɔnten so kwan a agye din.
I’m not really with him.	Me ne no ankasa.
We seem to do a great deal here.	Ɛte sɛ nea yɛyɛ ade kɛse wɔ ha.
They worked for hours.	Wɔde nnɔnhwerew pii yɛɛ adwuma.
However, not everyone is like that.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ obiara na ɔte saa.
That’s what we’re here for.	Ɛno ne nea yɛwɔ ha nti.
I never should have told you that.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meka saa kyerɛ wo da.
All of this is	Eyi nyinaa ne .
Three lifts at the end.	Nneɛma abiɛsa a wɔde ma so wɔ awiei koraa no.
He sounded quite strong on the phone.	Ná ɔte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ den koraa wɔ telefon so.
He also had one on him, too.	Na ɔwɔ bi nso wɔ ne so, nso.
There was danger every day.	Ná asiane wɔ hɔ da biara da.
Think back to your school days.	Susuw wo sukuu nna no ho hwɛ.
He knew how lucky he was.	Na onim sɛnea n’ani agye.
And the food looks fantastic too.	Na aduan no nso te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
For the police, that is.	Wɔ polisifo fam no, kyerɛ sɛ.
He didn’t know anything.	Ná onnim hwee.
He is on the water.	Ɔwɔ nsu no so.
This story begins in a stable.	Saa asɛm yi fi ase wɔ mmoa dan bi mu.
This was not supposed to be.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ saa.
I love the job.	M’ani gye adwuma no ho.
They looked down at him.	Wɔde wɔn ani too fam.
I want to touch it.	Mepɛ sɛ mede me nsa ka.
I’m not sure if that’s possible.	Me nnim sɛ ebia ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye.
Music.	Nnwom.
We can run.	Yebetumi atu mmirika.
Keep it alive.	Fa no tra ase.
I can see why that is.	Mihu nea enti a ɛte saa.
At least one of them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, biako.
Which is very beautiful.	Nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Everything is nothing.	Biribiara nyɛ hwee.
It was a wonderful movie.	Ná ɛyɛ sini a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
In a way, they were.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na wɔyɛ saa.
There is a lot of information.	Nsɛm pii wom.
But it has been a lot of fun.	Nanso ayɛ anigye pii.
He played with her.	Ɔne no dii agoru.
I didn’t know the kid.	Ná minnim abofra no.
There is nothing.	Ade biara nni hɔ.
But you go.	Nanso wo kɔ.
It’s how we use it for good or evil that matters.	Ɛyɛ sɛnea yɛde di dwuma ma papa anaa bɔne no na ɛho hia.
That’s not a few days.	Ɛno nyɛ nna kakraa bi.
I needed this job.	Ná saa adwuma yi hia me.
He’s a squirrel.	Ɔyɛ ɔkraman.
I should have known better.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu yiye.
However, it is very difficult.	Nanso, ɛyɛ den yiye.
I even act in them.	Meyɛ ade mpo wɔ wɔn mu.
I wanted to see him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu no.
I love the group.	M’ani gye kuw no ho.
No one does that anymore.	Obiara nyɛ saa bio.
It may not be true for you.	Ebia ɛnyɛ nokware mma wo.
Consider two cases.	Susuw nsɛm abien ho hwɛ.
I don’t need to tell you.	Ɛho nhia sɛ meka kyerɛ wo.
He seemed to enjoy it.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye ho.
The matter is very disturbing.	Asɛm no haw no kɛse.
There was so much to enjoy.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a yebetumi anya mu anigye.
Maybe next year.	Ebia afe a edi hɔ no.
He grew stronger every day.	Ɔyɛɛ den kɛse da biara da.
That would be the case.	Ná ɛno bɛyɛ saa.
I had to give him that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede saa asɛm no ma no.
Her clothes are elegant and elegant.	Ne ntade yɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ fɛ.
You are more beautiful than that.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ sen saa.
But there is no reason for me to get involved in this.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ mede me ho hyɛ eyi mu.
He’s in there.	Ɔwɔ mu hɔ.
He got along well with everyone.	Ɔne obiara dii yiye.
Is that a little strange?	So ɛno yɛ nwonwa kakra?
Everything seems to be done the right way.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ biribiara ɔkwan pa so.
That makes the hardest part of the game a lot easier.	Ɛno ma agoru no fã a ɛyɛ den sen biara no yɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
But this was not a homogeneous group.	Nanso na eyi nyɛ kuw a ɛyɛ biako.
Eventually, he did.	Awiei koraa no, ɔyɛɛ saa.
We can’t do it alone.	Yɛn nkutoo ntumi nyɛ saa.
Remove it from the so.	Yi fi so.
But below is one striking image.	Nanso mfonini biako a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ase hɔ.
This is very true, he has a point.	Eyi yɛ nokware paa, ɔwɔ asɛm bi.
Complete policy statement.	Nhyehyɛe ho asɛm a edi mũ.
People were really nice.	Ná nkurɔfo ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
I thought he would be great.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔbɛyɛ kɛse.
I almost got wet.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ me ho yɛɛ nsu.
As you say, it often wasn’t what it was.	Sɛnea woka no, mpɛn pii no na ɛnyɛ sɛnea na ɛte.
Two of each, front and back.	Wɔn mu biara mu abien, anim ne akyi.
He had no idea if this thing would work.	Ná onni adwene biara sɛ ebia saa ade yi bɛyɛ adwuma anaa.
I'm here.	Mete ha.
And indeed it may or may not.	Na ampa ara se ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
But not in this case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa asɛm yi mu.
So they put it off year after year.	Enti wɔde too nkyɛn afe mu ne afe mu.
But they are	Nanso wɔyɛ .
One must remember.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi kae.
We are strong.	Yɛyɛ den.
At least he could try.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na obetumi abɔ mmɔden.
But it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛnte saa.
This is a lot of fun.	Eyi yɛ anigye kɛse.
But even this is not without incident.	Nanso eyi mpo nyɛ nea asɛm biara a esii.
It’s a pleasure to use.	Ɛyɛ anigye sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
That’s a lot harder than it just looks.	Ɛno yɛ den kɛse sen sɛnea ɛte no ara kwa.
At least not us.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ yɛn.
Check it out today!.	Hwɛ no nnɛ!.
I don’t know, really.	Minnim, ampa.
I thought we were friends.	Ná misusuw sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo.
That was what he wanted.	Ɛno ne nea na ɔpɛ.
It was definitely ahead of its time.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na edi ne bere anim.
That happened many times.	Ɛno sii mpɛn pii.
But anyway, that’s what they tell us.	Nanso sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛno ne nea wɔka kyerɛ yɛn.
I wish everyone the best'.	Mepɛ nea eye sen biara ma obiara'.
This is one such book.	Eyi yɛ nhoma a ɛte saa no mu biako.
But you'd be surprised how quickly three hours fills up.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ wo nwonwa sɛnea nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa hyɛ mu ma ntɛmntɛm no.
It is true that only man knows that he is alive.	Ɛyɛ nokware sɛ onipa nkutoo na onim sɛ ɔte ase.
Dinner last night and tonight from one.	Anwummere aduan anadwo a etwaam ne anadwo yi fi biako hɔ.
It’s a state of mind that food has no control over.	Ɛyɛ adwene tebea a aduan nni so tumi.
You and you alone will do it.	Wo ne wo nkutoo na wobɛyɛ.
It has an end.	Ɛwɔ awiei.
Meetings were held without me.	Ná wɔyɛ nhyiam ahorow a me nka ho.
That’s why this is happening.	Ɛno nti na eyi rekɔ so no.
I'm just working.	Meyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
Water is less dense when warm.	Nsu nyɛ den pii bere a ɛyɛ hyew no.
Everything will be fine.	Biribiara bɛyɛ yiye.
The strong animals threatened human lives.	Mmoa a wɔn ho yɛ den no de nnipa nkwa too asiane mu.
There is nothing we can do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ.
Or maybe it’s.	Anaasɛ ebia.
It looked like a living thing.	Ná ɛte sɛ ade a ɛte ase.
You tell me why.	Wo na woka nea enti a ɛte saa kyerɛ me.
Everyone seemed happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obiara ani agye.
I thought that was what you meant.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno ne nea wopɛ sɛ woka.
This seems to be a plausible statement.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nokware.
There is still much to do.	Ɛda so ara yɛ pii a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
He used it well.	Ɔde dii dwuma yiye.
The problem is the money.	Ɔhaw no ne sika no.
He desperately wants to be a part of us.	Ɔpɛ paa sɛ ɔyɛ yɛn fã.
But perhaps he could.	Nanso ebia na obetumi ayɛ saa.
He put his foot down again.	Ɔde ne nan sii fam bio.
Another reason is that it is unnecessary.	Ade foforo nti a ɛte saa ne sɛ ɛho nhia.
It is very large.	Ɛyɛ kɛse paa.
He used to be amazing.	Kan no na ɔyɛ nwonwa.
I’m interested in work.	M’ani gye adwuma ho.
It was just something that seemed more interesting.	Na ɛyɛ biribi a ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse ara kwa.
The real image may be copied from the real image.	Ebia wɔde mfonini ankasa no bɛyɛ mfonini a ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa no ho mfonini.
I loved those things.	Ná m’ani gye saa nneɛma no ho.
The concept of power is familiar even to children.	Tumi ho adwene no yɛ nea mmofra mpo nim.
Too much trouble.	Ɔhaw dodo.
But what has happened, has happened.	Nanso nea asi no, asi.
See if you can find yourself something better.	Hwɛ sɛ wubetumi anya wo ho biribi a eye sen saa anaa.
But take a moment and look.	Nanso gye bere tiaa bi na hwɛ.
Just my name.	Me din kɛkɛ.
This dog has soft, short coat.	Saa ɔkraman yi wɔ aboa nhoma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ tiaa.
I like the picture so much.	M’ani gye mfonini no ho kɛse.
That is simply a mistake.	Ɛno yɛ mfomso ara kwa.
Money in completely.	Sika mu koraa.
Maybe that was the problem.	Ebia na ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
He would do that.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ saa.
This dress is too short.	Saa atade yi yɛ tiaa dodo.
It hardly matters.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛho nhia.
He succeeds only for a short time.	Odi yiye bere tiaa bi pɛ.
Or right now.	Anaasɛ mprempren ara.
It was cold again.	Ná awɔw ayɛ kɛse bio.
It’s not the way it is.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛte.
Except for one thing.	Gye sɛ ade biako pɛ.
He put his hand on the table and leaned against it.	Ɔde ne nsa too pon no so de ne ho too so.
I know what happened, and so do you.	Minim nea esii, na wo nso wunim.
For more details cf.	Sɛ wopɛ nsɛm pii a, hwɛ.
However, none of them claim to know much about it.	Nanso, wɔn mu biara nka sɛ onim ho nsɛm pii ankasa.
There was only one way I knew how to make a movie.	Ɔkwan biako pɛ na na minim sɛnea wɔyɛ sini.
You may not be able to do that.	Ebia worentumi nyɛ saa.
Children still come home from school.	Mmofra da so ara fi sukuu ba fie.
His mind is simple, and even when it wasn’t.	N’adwene yɛ mmerɛw, na bere mpo a na ɛnte saa no.
I hope that will be interesting.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ anigye.
You bring such passion to your music.	Wode anigye a ɛte saa ba wo nnwom so.
Soft and warm and full.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ hyew na ɛyɛ ma.
The same goes for next year.	Saa ara na afe a edi hɔ no nso te.
You have done a lot of work today.	Woayɛ adwuma pii nnɛ.
Monday is the first day of the week.	Memeneda yɛ dapɛn no mu da a edi kan.
But that’s what’s happening here.	Nanso ɛno ne nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha.
He's always so disorganized.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔnyɛ nhyehyɛe saa bere nyinaa.
Someone had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ saa.
It was his only time.	Ná ɛyɛ ne bere koro pɛ.
He gave me a smile.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ me so.
The man held up the picture.	Ɔbarima no maa mfonini no so.
It seems to me to be the same.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ me sɛ ɛte saa ara.
I know everything.	Minim biribiara.
Below is the.	Wɔ ase ha.
I still, as they say,.	Meda so ara, sɛnea wɔka no,.
He's always a little weird.	Ɔyɛ nwonwa kakra bere nyinaa.
I am actually doing this.	Mereyɛ eyi ankasa.
Songs you don’t know, songs no one has ever heard before.	Nnwom a wunnim, nnwom a obiara nte da.
Not in the game, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ agoru no mu, ɔkwan biara so.
I have it now.	Mewɔ mprempren.
It was cold at night, hot during the day.	Anadwo na awɔw wom, awia no na ɛyɛ hyew.
I did that in the test.	Meyɛɛ saa wɔ sɔhwɛ no mu.
It’s quite simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
At least not immediately.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ ntɛm ara.
He’s the one.	Ɔne no.
But there is one thing.	Nanso ade biako wɔ hɔ.
The city was filled with life.	Nkwa hyɛɛ kurow no mu.
Please, someone tell us another story.	Mesrɛ wo, obi ka asɛm foforo nkyerɛ yɛn.
He was a really nice guy.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
And he had no idea what he was feeling.	Na na onni nea ɔte nka ho adwene biara.
I am sorry that things have gone this way.	Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ nneɛma akɔ saa kwan yi so.
Just as it is right now.	Sɛnea ɛte mprempren yi ara.
He made a plan for it.	Ɔyɛɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
This man is a genius.	Saa ɔbarima yi yɛ obi a ne ho akokwaw.
I have given you another way.	Mede ɔkwan foforo ama wo.
Without each other it just doesn’t work.	Sɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho nni hɔ a ɛnyɛ adwuma kɛkɛ.
I just wanted someone else to know.	Ná mepɛ sɛ obi foforo hu ara kwa.
That’s a gun.	Ɛno yɛ tuo.
At least that made me feel at home.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno maa metee nka sɛ mewɔ fie.
Which we kind of did.	Nea na yɛyɛ no ɔkwan bi so no.
And someone else did.	Na obi nso yɛɛ saa.
It had seeds.	Ná ɛwɔ aba.
Maybe we’ll be one of them.	Ebia yɛbɛyɛ wɔn mu biako.
I love that kid.	M’ani gye saa abofra no ho.
But it wasn’t either.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ saa nso.
The plan is the same for every person.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛ ade koro ma onipa biara.
I’ll be happy with it.	M’ani begye ho.
There was no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
So it shouldn’t surprise us.	Enti ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn nwonwa.
I had no idea how it would work here.	Ná minnim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
Easy enough for a child.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ ma abofra.
All included in the price.	Ne nyinaa ka ho wɔ bo no mu.
That’s just his way, all of it.	Ɛno ne ne kwan ara kwa, ne nyinaa.
It should be taken to the house.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde kɔ fie hɔ.
She knew the perfect person for her.	Ná onim onipa a ɔyɛ pɛ ma no.
Please say another one.	Mesrɛ wo, ka foforo nso.
Kids are getting taller these days.	Mmofra reyɛ tenten nnansa yi.
But it’s him.	Nanso ɛyɛ ɔno.
There is no school in town.	Sukuu biara nni kurow no mu.
He focused on it.	Ɔde n’adwene sii so.
The hands came down.	Nsa no baa fam.
He slipped into her.	Ɔde ne ho bɔɔ ne mu.
Just hang out and make friends.	Fa wo ho to hɔ kɛkɛ na fa nnamfo.
However, this is no longer entirely true.	Nanso, eyi nyɛ nokware koraa bio.
Next, he fully joined me.	Nea edi hɔ no, ɔde ne ho bɔɔ me koraa.
I can’t say anything yet.	Mintumi nka hwee de besi nnɛ.
This information is very simple.	Saa nsɛm yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
The animals are becoming increasingly rare.	Mmoa no reyɛ nea wɔn ho yɛ na kɛse.
It’s too scary now.	Ɛyɛ hu dodo mprempren.
So who is he?.	Enti hena ne no?.
I knew it was happening.	Ná minim sɛ ɛrekɔ so.
The words come alive.	Nsɛm no ba nkwa mu.
That would be like your father.	Ɛno bɛyɛ sɛ wo papa.
He slammed his hand on the table.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ pon no so.
He doesn’t really do that.	Ɔnyɛ saa ankasa.
We have a room here.	Yɛwɔ dan bi wɔ ha.
It’s not me.	Ɛnyɛ me.
I thought that might work.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma.
Remember the name.	Kae din no.
I’m the one who has that.	Me na mewɔ saa.
I knew he knew that too.	Ná minim sɛ ɔno nso nim saa.
And this will be the case.	Na eyi bɛyɛ saa.
This is why he was one of my favorite characters.	Eyi nti na na ɔyɛ nnipa a m’ani gye wɔn ho paa no mu biako no.
I just don’t know about that guy.	Minnim saa ɔbarima no ho asɛm kɛkɛ.
My father was never a happy man.	Ná me papa nyɛ ɔbarima a ɔwɔ anigye da.
Really amazing stuff.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
They all have some truth to them.	Wɔn nyinaa wɔ nokware bi ma wɔn.
That’s part of the game.	Ɛno yɛ agoru no fã.
But here’s the thing.	Nanso ade no ni.
Perhaps there is an easier way.	Ebia ɔkwan bi wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sen saa.
Do it if you have to.	Yɛ no sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa a.
What do you think of it.	Dɛn na wususuw.
I understand completely.	Mete ase koraa.
But it’s a little easier.	Nanso ɛyɛ mmerɛw kakra.
Our friends will do the same.	Yɛn nnamfo nso bɛyɛ saa.
And all men are not sinners.	Na nnipa nyinaa nyɛ bɔne.
Someone did the same to me.	Obi yɛɛ me nso saa.
Look at my eyes.	Hwɛ m’ani so.
It doesn’t have to be complicated.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
Who doesn’t want to be successful?	Hena na ɔmpɛ sɛ odi yiye?
There are other things we need to use.	Nneɛma foforo wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde di dwuma.
Thus, the issue of time becomes a matter of human factor.	Enti, bere ho asɛm no bɛyɛ onipa ade ho asɛm.
I wasn’t sure where he was taking his words.	Ná m’ani nnye baabi a ɔde ne nsɛm rekɔ no ho.
The prison is located on a suburban road.	Afiase no wɔ kurow no akyi kwan bi.
The group continues.	Kuw no kɔ so.
He was a very handsome man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
It was all over.	Ná ne nyinaa aba awiei.
He just wanted the man gone.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔbarima no kɔ ara kwa.
What that might be, he had no idea.	Nea ebia ɛno bɛyɛ no, na onni ho adwene biara.
The dress was long, with long sleeves.	Ná atade no tenten, na na nsa tenten wɔ so.
I slipped my hands around her.	Mede me nsa kaa ne ho.
The bus dropped them off.	Bɔs no de wɔn sii hɔ.
That’s how it should be.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
The story is amazing.	Asɛm no yɛ nwonwa.
Once, none of us really.	Bere bi, yɛn mu biara ankasa.
What is the reason for this?	Dɛn ne nea enti a ɛte saa?
After all, a party is everything to everyone.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, apontow yɛ biribiara ma obiara.
It’s the game that matters.	Ɛyɛ agoru no na ɛho hia.
He was probably gone now, and he would be fine.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na onni hɔ bio mprempren, na ne ho bɛtɔ no.
The moon is almost full.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔsram no ayɛ ma.
The end of the movie.	Sini no awiei.
I understand this business a lot more than he does.	Mete saa adwuma yi ase pii sen ɔno.
You know you are with me.	Wunim sɛ woka me ho.
I’m interested in that.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
It has been a long day.	Ayɛ da tenten bi.
I didn’t like it at all.	Ná m’ani nnye ho koraa.
It wasn’t as easy as he thought.	Ná ɛnyɛ mmerɛw sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa sɛnea na osusuw no.
He was told that the police would come.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ polisifo bɛba.
Again, simple and easy.	Bio nso, ɛnyɛ den na ɛnyɛ den.
He is not the issue here.	Ɛnyɛ ɔno ne asɛm no wɔ ha.
Really? 	Pa ara?
How much was this meal?	Ná aduan yi yɛ ahe?
It was a strong hand.	Ná ɛyɛ nsa a ɛyɛ den.
But the city is the city.	Nanso kurow no ne kurow no.
It’s the hardest for you.	Ɛyɛ den ma wo sen biara.
Everyone from here.	Obiara fi ha.
What he was doing was very simple.	Ná nea ɔreyɛ no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
He was the most popular.	Ná ɔno ne obi a nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho kɛse.
Production will continue to grow.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ no bɛkɔ so ayɛ kɛse.
I just loved everything he did.	M’ani gyee biribiara a ɔyɛ ho ara kwa.
You can’t just eat everything.	Worentumi nni biribiara kɛkɛ.
I don’t want to hear that.	Mempɛ sɛ mete saa asɛm no.
The story was blowing up.	Ná asɛm no rebɔ.
I cannot find such information.	Mintumi nnya nsɛm a ɛte saa.
No one wants a weakling.	Obiara mpɛ obi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw.
It’s a lot of work.	Ɛyɛ adwuma pii.
An idea came to him.	Adwene bi baa ne so.
You were a child.	Ná woyɛ abofra.
Hurry up, close the door.	Yɛ ntɛm, to ɔpon no mu.
Almost every one of them did.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔn mu biara yɛɛ saa.
I think that’s about it now.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno fa ho mprempren.
I feel like it’s happening a little bit more every day.	Mete nka sɛ ɛrekɔ so kakra da biara da.
He’s doing good too.	Ɔno nso reyɛ papa.
However, it is not.	Nanso, ɛnte saa.
So that seems like a big problem.	Enti ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
If there is something better.	Sɛ biribi a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ a.
I don’t want you to be late for work.	Mempɛ sɛ wobɛka akyi wɔ adwuma mu.
What will you do with the money?	Dɛn na wode sika no bɛyɛ?
And that’s the issue here as well.	Na ɛno ne asɛm a ɛwɔ ha nso.
I found out about it recently.	Mihuu ho asɛm nnansa yi ara.
For many, there are many opportunities.	Wɔ nnipa pii fam no, hokwan pii wɔ hɔ.
However, you can be too young.	Nanso, wubetumi ayɛ abofra dodo.
But there was a problem with that.	Nanso na ɔhaw bi wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
No mistake was in danger.	Ná mfomso biara nni asiane mu.
I can’t say anything about that.	Mintumi nka saa asɛm no ho hwee.
Maybe that’s just how you think it should be.	Ebia saa ara ne sɛnea wususuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na eyi betumi aba.
I have done quite a lot towards that.	Mayɛ nneɛma pii koraa akɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Talk about amazing power.	Ka tumi a ɛyɛ nwonwa ho asɛm.
A new window will appear.	Mfɛnsere foforo bi bɛba.
There is no money for them.	Sika biara nni hɔ mma wɔn.
You just want it worse for the kid.	Wopɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne kɛse ma abofra no ara kwa.
At least for a while.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, bere tiaa bi.
He is no better than that.	Ɔnyɛ papa sen saa.
I don’t have anyone.	Minni obiara.
This has been going on for a long time.	Eyi akɔ so bere tenten ni.
However, I can’t do that anymore.	Nanso, mintumi nyɛ saa bio.
There wasn’t much.	Ná nneɛma pii nni hɔ.
No one said a word.	Obiara anka asɛm biara.
That is not the case with me.	Ɛnte saa wɔ me fam.
Interested ones often attend these meetings.	Wɔn a wɔn ani gye ho taa kɔ nhyiam ahorow yi ase.
Not that he has much.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔwɔ pii.
And he knew a lot about a lot of things.	Na na onim nneɛma pii fa nneɛma pii ho.
The house was full of books.	Ná nhoma ahyɛ ofie hɔ ma.
I know a thing or two about your type.	Minim ade biako anaa abien fa wo su no ho.
You’re doing it right.	Woreyɛ no yiye.
You just have to, at least for now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa ara, anyɛ yiye koraa no mprempren.
He speaks three languages ​​fluently.	Ɔka kasa abiɛsa yiye.
I wanted her to be happy.	Ná mepɛ sɛ n’ani gye.
Everything has gone well.	Ne nyinaa akɔ yiye.
That he did.	Sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
You are among friends.	Woka nnamfo ho.
See the footnotes below.	Hwɛ nsɛm a ɛwɔ ase hɔ no.
It is, and it will be.	Ɛte saa, na ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I will work with this.	Me ne eyi bɛyɛ adwuma.
Children love it too.	Mmofra nso ani gye ho.
He wasn’t cold.	Ná ɔnyɛ awɔw.
It’s night and day.	Ɛyɛ anadwo ne awia.
Wear good shoes.	Hyɛ mpaboa pa.
Pictures and illustrations too.	Mfonini ne mfonini ahorow nso.
You have to live with it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no tra ase.
The melody of that song is awesome.	Saa dwom no nnwom no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
And so did mine.	Na me de nso.
I want you to do what you want to do.	Mepɛ sɛ woyɛ nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ.
We have enough of that.	Yɛwɔ saa nneɛma no a ɛdɔɔso.
That’s most of us.	Ɛno ne yɛn mu dodow no ara.
Good job, if you can find it.	Adwuma pa, sɛ wubetumi anya bi a.
I don't know where it is now.	Minnim baabi a ɛwɔ mprempren.
The dog will be hit by a car.	Kar bɛbɔ ɔkraman no.
The man was in no condition.	Ná ɔbarima no nni tebea biara mu.
Maybe that will be you too.	Ebia ɛno nso bɛyɛ wo.
But the story we have is not good.	Nanso asɛm a yɛwɔ no nyɛ papa.
Be very careful here.	Hwɛ yiye paa wɔ ha.
It will be a good day.	Ɛbɛyɛ da pa.
He is very versatile.	Ɔde nneɛma yɛ adwuma pii.
He wanted the stories.	Ná ɔpɛ nsɛm no.
Mother did what she had to do.	Maame yɛɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I don’t know anything.	Minnim hwee.
Whether you like it or not.	Sɛ wopɛ anaasɛ wompɛ.
Too late again.	Akyiri dodo bio.
Me, the one who doesn’t want to be hurt.	Me, nea mempɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no bɔne no.
I'm not much help.	Menyɛ mmoa pii.
It was a hot day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ hyew.
Stories are terrible.	Asɛm ahorow yɛ hu.
I lost sight of that for a few hours, but it’s true.	M’ani fii saa asɛm no so nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi, nanso ɛyɛ nokware.
They seemed to be friends.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ nnamfo.
Talk about it.	Ka ho asɛm.
There are two things here.	Nneɛma abien na ɛwɔ ha.
This creates an overall positive environment.	Eyi ma tebea a eye nyinaa ba.
There is no better gun and the price is fantastic.	Tuo biara nni hɔ a eye sen saa na ne bo a ɛwɔ so no yɛ nwonwa.
I do it quite a lot.	Meyɛ no pii koraa.
Not bad, but not all that great either.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne, nanso ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa kɛse nso.
He loved to play a lot with the kids.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔne mmofra no bedi agoru pii.
You can do the same thing.	Wo nso wubetumi ayɛ saa ara.
It’s a huge risk.	Ɛyɛ asiane kɛse.
This is working great.	Eyi reyɛ adwuma kɛse.
And he never did that.	Na ɔnyɛ saa da.
It wasn’t like he knew anyone.	Na ɛnyɛ te sɛ nea onim obi.
Everything is working.	Biribiara reyɛ adwuma.
He was told that he was in trouble.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɔwɔ ɔhaw mu.
They are beautiful.	Wɔyɛ fɛ.
The water went down quickly.	Nsu no kɔɔ fam ntɛmntɛm.
I don’t know where it is but somewhere.	Minnim baabi a ɛwɔ nanso baabi.
Something needs to be done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ade bi.
I really liked the characters in this book.	M’ani gyee nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm wɔ nhoma yi mu no ho paa.
It is obviously happening.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛrekɔ so.
I had the same problem.	Ná mewɔ ɔhaw koro no ara.
But that’s neither here nor there.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ ha anaa ha.
They are only interested in their own work.	Wɔn ankasa adwuma nkutoo na wɔn ani gye ho.
For the project.	Wɔ adwuma no ho.
I can’t feel my hands.	Mintumi nte me nsa nka.
But more needs to be done.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ pii.
Tomorrow, we’ll both be fine.	Ɔkyena, yɛn baanu nyinaa bɛyɛ yiye.
The boy knows very well that he will do as he is told.	Abarimaa no nim yiye sɛ ɔbɛyɛ sɛnea wɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​no.
The first month might be just that.	Ebia ɔsram a edi kan no bɛyɛ ɛno nkutoo.
But it was too late to do anything about it.	Nanso na aka akyi dodo sɛ yɛbɛyɛ ho hwee.
And it was a sin.	Na ɛyɛ bɔne.
The water felt warm.	Nsu no tee nka sɛ ɛyɛ hyew.
He could play it on.	Ná obetumi abɔ no akɔ so.
That had been the case.	Ná ɛno ayɛ saa.
Take a look at yourself.	Fa w’ani hwɛ.
Not even this one.	Ɛnyɛ eyi mpo.
He was a handsome man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I had no plans.	Ná minni nhyehyɛe biara.
The song was over.	Ná dwom no aba awiei.
So do many people.	Saa ara na nnipa pii nso yɛ.
None of this feels real.	Eyi mu biara nte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
For this group.	Wɔ saa kuw yi ho.
You’ll be relieved.	Wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
They were told it was not an opportunity.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ wɔn sɛ ɛnyɛ hokwan bi.
Play it again.	Bɔ no bio.
This is your lucky day.	Eyi ne wo da a ɛyɛ anigye.
I don’t do that either.	Me nso menyɛ saa.
Show that in order to.	Kyerɛ a sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a.
He could do that with one hand.	Ná obetumi de ne nsa biako ayɛ saa adwuma no.
Thank you to each of you.	Meda mo mu biara ase.
What is your favorite food?	Aduan bɛn na w’ani gye ho paa?
You have our story.	Wowɔ yɛn asɛm.
It was old school.	Na ɛyɛ sukuu dedaw.
This involves complex controls.	Eyi fa nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma a ɛyɛ den ho.
The team has done an amazing job.	Kuw no ayɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
But it’s definitely interesting.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
I had to do what was best for him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nea eye ma no.
I loved that movie.	M’ani gyee saa sini no ho.
The currency is falling in value.	Sika no bo rekɔ fam.
I was not very good at school.	Ná menyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw kɛse wɔ sukuu mu.
It’s still morning	Ɛda so ara yɛ anɔpa
However, I will say this.	Nanso, mɛka eyi.
I can take some time, now.	Metumi agye bere kakra, mprempren.
That was really amazing.	Ná ɛno yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
It’s not true.	Ɛnyɛ nokware.
It doesn’t hurt me a bit.	Ɛnyɛ me yaw kakra.
We spend the rest of our lives playing with it.	Yɛde yɛn nkwa nna nyinaa di agoru wɔ ho.
Everyone talks about it loudly.	Obiara ka ho asɛm denneennen.
Everything went into the book.	Biribiara kɔɔ nhoma no mu.
One way or another I don't care.	Ɔkwan bi so anaa ɔkwan foforo so no mfa me ho.
But it still isn’t.	Nanso ɛda so ara nyɛ saa.
You would have done the same.	Anka wo nso woayɛ saa.
It’s so scary.	Ɛyɛ hu paa.
Hope you are doing well.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ woreyɛ yiye.
Police immediately took him into custody.	Polisifo de no too afiase ntɛm ara.
He had good hands.	Ná ɔwɔ nsa pa.
At least one of them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, biako.
I couldn’t even get that right.	Na mintumi nnya saa asɛm no yiye mpo.
Their coat is very thick and short in length.	Wɔn atade no yɛ den yiye na ne tenten yɛ tiaa.
I am too strong a person.	Meyɛ obi a me ho yɛ den dodo.
I want to make sure that.	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ hu sɛ.
This should be interesting.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ anigye.
But he had done it right.	Nanso na wayɛ no yiye.
I made that one up.	Me na meyɛɛ saa biako no.
He didn’t know.	Ná onnim.
Most are, however, likely for several reasons.	Nanso, dodow no ara te saa, na ɛbɛyɛ sɛ nneɛma pii nti na ɛte saa.
He was very good at it.	Ná ne ho akokwaw yiye wɔ mu.
But in the end.	Nanso awiei koraa no.
A positive view of man.	Onipa ho adwene pa.
I had him.	Ná mewɔ no.
Thank you for this good morning.	Meda mo ase wɔ anɔpa pa yi ho.
It’s his city.	Ɛyɛ ne kurow.
In the short term it is good enough.	Wɔ bere tiaa mu no ɛyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Do it yourself.	Yɛ no ankasa.
This situation has been going on for far too long.	Saa tebea yi akɔ so akyɛ dodo.
He told himself it was okay.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
I don't know if it works or not.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛyɛ adwuma anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
I want him to be there.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ.
He nodded several times.	Ɔde ne ti too fam mpɛn pii.
Finally he wanted to tell us everything.	Awiei koraa no na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka biribiara kyerɛ yɛn.
That didn’t surprise him.	Ɛno anyɛ no nwonwa.
My name was the.	Ná me din de.
You could be in a very dangerous situation.	Wubetumi akɔ tebea a ɛyɛ hu kɛse mu.
Much like him too.	Pii te sɛ ɔno nso.
What do we do now? 	Dɛn na yɛyɛ mprempren?
Not a bad idea.	Ɛnyɛ adwene bɔne.
But it was full of hope.	Nanso na anidaso ahyɛ mu ma.
It was not widely known.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea nnipa pii nim.
Supply.	Fa ma.
This book is really interesting.	Nhoma yi yɛ anigye ankasa.
So there is little we can do.	Enti kakraa bi na yebetumi ayɛ.
This precedes all else.	Eyi di nneɛma a aka nyinaa anim.
This is a new group.	Eyi yɛ kuw foforo.
It’s not my fear at all.	Ɛnyɛ me suro koraa.
We both do that.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛ saa.
Or at least you feel with us.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, wo ne yɛn te nka.
The bad guys are here.	Nnipa bɔne no wɔ ha.
It was easy from then on.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw fi saa bere no.
None of them win.	Wɔn mu biara nni nkonim.
So for the sake of completeness we give it here.	Enti sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a edi mũ nti yɛde ma wɔ ha.
Everyone knows now.	Obiara nim mprempren.
That is something none of us can control.	Ɛno yɛ biribi a yɛn mu biara ntumi nni so.
This was obviously new information for him.	Ɛda adi sɛ na eyi yɛ nsɛm foforo ma no.
But it works well.	Nanso ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
That’s the plan.	Ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no.
I was interested in something else.	Ná m’ani gye biribi foforo ho.
So will everyone else.	Saa ara na obiara bɛyɛ.
Thank you for setting me on the right path.	Meda wo ase sɛ wode me asi ɔkwan pa so.
Further work on this is needed.	Ɛho hia sɛ wɔyɛ eyi ho adwuma foforo.
It’s not a cheap gun.	Ɛnyɛ tuo a ne bo nyɛ den.
I just couldn’t do it.	Na mintumi nyɛ kɛkɛ.
But is that the point.	Nanso so ɛno ne asɛm no.
It’s a really big deal.	Ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse ankasa.
Everything was the same.	Ná nneɛma nyinaa yɛ biako.
This arrangement usually works well.	Mpɛn pii no, nhyehyɛe yi yɛ adwuma yiye.
Look at the kids and the animals.	Hwɛ mmofra ne mmoa no.
Their time spent the day before.	Wɔn bere a wɔde dii dwuma da a edi kan no.
I just felt bad for those people.	Ná ɛyɛ me yaw wɔ saa nkurɔfo no ho kɛkɛ.
But a very expensive seed.	Nanso aba a ne bo yɛ den yiye.
That is a huge amount of information.	Ɛno yɛ nsɛm a ɛdɔɔso kɛse.
The atmosphere in the room was filled with excitement.	Ná anigye ahyɛ tebea a ɛwɔ dan no mu no mu ma.
He patted the dog absently.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ɔkraman no a na onni hɔ.
The story was there.	Ná asɛm no wɔ hɔ.
These comments have been very helpful.	Saa nsɛm yi aboa kɛse.
The most important thing.	Ade a ɛho hia sen biara.
Do not touch the hair.	Mfa wo nsa nka ti nhwi no.
My hair is very long.	Me ti nhwi yɛ tenten paa.
That has worked extremely well for me.	Ɛno ayɛ adwuma yiye koraa ama me.
The problem had become more serious.	Ná ɔhaw no mu ayɛ den kɛse.
Add additional information if necessary.	Fa nsɛm foforo ka ho sɛ ɛho hia a.
And this is the point.	Na eyi ne asɛm no.
This is an incredibly simple method.	Eyi yɛ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Do only what you want.	Yɛ nea wopɛ nkutoo.
Terms of imprisonment generally ranged from one to three years.	Mpɛn pii no, na bere a wɔde da afiase no yɛ mfe biako kosi abiɛsa.
Someone made a mistake.	Obi dii mfomso.
I hope you enjoy the new work.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye adwuma foforo no ho.
I’d appreciate any help.	M’ani begye mmoa biara ho.
He was strong, but he recovered.	Ɔyɛɛ den, nanso ne ho yɛɛ no ​​yiye.
I’m happy to be free of him.	M’ani agye sɛ mede me ho afi ne ho.
I can’t imagine it.	Mintumi nsusuw ho.
It’s worse than that.	Ɛyɛ bɔne sen saa.
We can focus on me.	Yebetumi de wɔn adwene asi me so.
But that was only half of it.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ ne fã pɛ.
Your mother is not well.	Wo maame ho nyɛ den.
Every street has a wonderful story to tell.	Abɔnten biara wɔ asɛm bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka.
They were good years.	Ná ɛyɛ mfe pa.
A number of people.	Nnipa dodow bi.
Not much else now.	Ɛnyɛ pii bio mprempren.
It seemed the best.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eye sen biara.
His hands and feet bothered me.	Ne nsa ne ne nan haw me.
He had to do what he had to do.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ nea na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
There are two possibilities.	Nneɛma abien bi betumi aba.
Use that group for everything.	Fa saa kuw no di dwuma ma biribiara.
Now he was in a bad situation.	Seesei de, na ɔwɔ tebea bɔne mu.
I forget what his name was.	Me werɛ fi nea na ne din de.
He is here, however, not for long.	Ɔwɔ ha, nanso, ɛnyɛ bere tenten.
It’s a big deal.	Ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse.
This is your last chance.	Eyi ne hokwan a etwa to a wowɔ.
I really enjoyed the movie.	M’ani gyee sini no ho paa.
The man was gone.	Ná ɔbarima no nni hɔ bio.
So he has to do it.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
Just one thing.	Ade biako pɛ.
You are certainly right.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ woayɛ no yiye.
That is true enough.	Ɛno yɛ nokware a ɛdɔɔso.
He wanted everything to be fun.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ biribiara yɛ anigye.
It wasn’t his fault.	Na ɛnyɛ ne mfomso.
There is no one here.	Obiara nni ha.
I could do no wrong.	Ná mintumi nyɛ bɔne biara.
Generally, I’m very impressed.	Mpɛn pii no, m’ani gye ho kɛse.
However, he doesn’t know anyone in the industry.	Nanso, onnim obiara wɔ adwuma no mu.
I'm going to trust you.	Mede me ho to wo so.
The child looked up at him.	Abofra no maa n’ani so hwɛɛ no.
Someone is here.	Obi wɔ ha.
You don’t want to know why someone did something.	Wompɛ sɛ wuhu nea enti a obi yɛɛ biribi.
There are two reasons for this.	Nneɛma abien nti na wɔyɛ eyi.
You have to do things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nneɛma.
As you say.	Sɛnea woka no.
Nevertheless, he made them.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɔyɛɛ wɔn.
He always says that.	Ɔka saa bere nyinaa.
However, it just isn’t.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ saa ara kwa.
It was midnight.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo fã.
You don’t really do that.	Wonyɛ saa ankasa.
I am a very simple man, with very simple tastes.	Meyɛ ɔbarima a meyɛ mmerɛw yiye, a mepɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
The content of the story.	Asɛm a ɛwɔ mu no.
Or maybe someone else will say it for him.	Anaasɛ ebia obi foforo bɛka ama no.
It was his fault.	Ná ɛyɛ ne bɔne.
You just want to see them.	Wopɛ sɛ wuhu wɔn ara kwa.
Be sure to use it sparingly.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wode bedi dwuma kakraa bi.
I feel unhappy and empty.	Mete nka sɛ m’ani nnye na meyɛ hwee.
I want you to know it’s not you.	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu sɛ ɛnyɛ wo.
Like me.	Te sɛ me.
Those two things were not the same.	Ná saa nneɛma abien no nyɛ pɛ.
I really like that.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho ankasa.
It is human nature to do so.	Ɛyɛ onipa su sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I certainly hope not.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
I wanted us.	Ná mepɛ yɛn.
I should have talked to you.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ me ne mo kasa.
Life is expensive.	Nkwa bo yɛ den.
People don’t really follow the team.	Nkurɔfo nni kuw no akyi ankasa.
It doesn’t seem much like what we were told.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnte sɛ nea wɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn no kɛse.
Everything, and nothing.	Biribiara, na biribiara nni hɔ.
He was available to do so.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ a obetumi ayɛ saa.
A lot of information can be drawn from this work.	Yebetumi anya nsɛm pii afi adwuma yi mu.
The man will do most of the work.	Ɔbarima no na ɔbɛyɛ adwuma no fã kɛse no ara.
A few cars continued to park on the road.	Kar kakraa bi kɔɔ so sii kwan no so.
The story is still the game.	Asɛm no da so ara yɛ agoru no.
But it didn’t.	Nanso anyɛ saa.
And he was a good one.	Na ɔyɛ papa.
Will be in serious trouble.	Bɛkɔ ɔhaw kɛse mu.
That was what the book had said.	Saa na na nhoma no aka.
He had no intention of doing so.	Ná ɔnyɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
But it is not human.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nnipa de.
I gave him my hand.	Mede me nsa maa no.
Boy or girl, he didn’t know.	Abarimaa anaa abeawa, na onnim.
I’m not that surprised.	Ɛnyɛ me nwonwa saa.
He is always there.	Ɔwɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
I took him in too.	Me nso mede no kɔɔ mu.
It had been a great first time for us.	Ná ayɛ bere a edi kan kɛse ama yɛn.
They were happy to be happy.	Ná ɛyɛ wɔn anigye sɛ wɔn ani begye.
I think you can do it.	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi ayɛ.
At the very least, he should try to help them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛboa wɔn.
I made it work.	Meyɛɛ no ​​sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
His eyes quickly moved from one to the other.	N’ani fii biako so kɔɔ foforo so ntɛmntɛm.
Which I just couldn’t give that.	Nea na mintumi mma saa ara kwa.
There is no need for him to do so.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Maybe it was there.	Ebia na ɛwɔ hɔ.
It is usually not painful.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ yaw.
You're right, anyway.	Woayɛ no yiye, sɛnea ɛte biara.
This was a test.	Ná eyi yɛ sɔhwɛ.
But that is not always the case.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛte saa.
It just seems so wrong.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse ara kwa.
They don’t like the idea too much.	Wɔn ani nnye adwene no ho dodo.
It’s a simple task.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛnyɛ den.
It just doesn’t work that way.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma saa ara kwa.
Would you like this too?.	Wo nso w’ani begye eyi ho?.
He’s looking at you.	N’ani da wo so.
If it isn’t already.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ saa dedaw a.
It’s their habit.	Ɛyɛ wɔn su.
How does he do this?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na ɔyɛ eyi?
Part of you does anyway.	Wo fã bi yɛ saa ɔkwan biara so.
To me it’s not that big of a deal.	Wɔ me fam no ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse saa.
Which is a real issue.	Nea ɛyɛ asɛm ankasa.
At least in the current interest.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ anigye a ɛwɔ hɔ mprempren no mu.
My dog ​​stayed with me.	Me kraman no traa me nkyɛn.
Two hours later, same.	Nnɔnhwerew abien akyi no, saa ara.
That was equally difficult.	Ná ɛno nso yɛ den saa ara.
He practically hung up the phone.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔde telefon no too fam.
That’s our only problem.	Ɛno nkutoo ne yɛn haw.
I would say you.	Anka mɛka sɛ wo.
I was nothing to him.	Ná menyɛ hwee mma no.
So that saved my life.	Enti ɛno gyee me nkwa.
My mother.	Me maame.
Every morning and every night.	Anɔpa biara ne anadwo biara.
None of us could have done anything like that.	Anka yɛn mu biara ntumi nyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
I don’t know him for sure.	Minnim no yiye.
He could just hit them.	Ná obetumi abɔ wɔn kɛkɛ.
He put it on his bed.	Ɔde too ne mpa so.
It’s incredibly bad for you.	Ɛyɛ bɔne a ɛyɛ nwonwa ma wo.
This way you can get their attention first, before anyone else.	Saa kwan yi so no wubetumi adi kan anya wɔn adwene, ansa na obi foforo biara aba.
I will give this to you.	Mede eyi bɛma wo.
I was somewhat familiar with this story.	Ná minim saa asɛm yi yiye kakra.
Only the best he can do from now on.	Nea obetumi ayɛ nea eye sen biara nkutoo fi saa bere yi rekɔ.
He just gave you your life and everything he had.	Ɔde wo nkwa ne biribiara a na ɔwɔ maa wo kɛkɛ.
This wonderful arrangement was exciting.	Ná nhyehyɛe a ɛyɛ nwonwa yi yɛ anigye.
If that means they are more expensive, not so.	Sɛ ɛno kyerɛ sɛ wɔn bo yɛ den sen saa a, ɛnte saa.
Now we are told that we cannot get food.	Seesei wɔka kyerɛ yɛn sɛ yɛrentumi nnya aduan.
He wasn’t that strong.	Ná ɔnyɛ den saa.
It’s very, very good.	Eye paa, eye paa.
Thank you for your time.	Meda wo ase wɔ wo bere ho.
I never really knew you.	Minnim wo ankasa da.
Day and night mean nothing.	Awia ne anadwo nkyerɛ hwee.
She was happy and strong.	Ná n’ani agye na na ne ho yɛ den.
I believe he does with you.	Migye di sɛ ɔne wo yɛ saa.
Put your trust in me.	Fa wo ho to me so.
He was a warm-hearted man.	Ná ne ho yɛ hyew.
He had to have people.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔwɔ nnipa.
Buses hit people.	Bɔs bɔ nkurɔfo.
He was shocked.	Ná ne ho dwiriw no.
Maybe I can’t feel anything anymore.	Ebia mintumi nte biribiara nka bio.
I'll take the dog outside.	Mede ɔkraman no bɛkɔ abɔnten.
He wants one of them.	Ɔpɛ wɔn mu biako.
But it is not there yet.	Nanso ɛnyɛ hɔ de besi nnɛ.
The same is true of recent events.	Saa ara na nsɛm a aba nnansa yi ara te.
It’s definitely been better than before.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ayɛ papa sen kan no.
It’s hard to deal with two kids.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wo ne mmofra baanu bedi nsɛm.
He ended it on the floor.	Ɔde baa awiei wɔ fam.
We are of one mind.	Yɛyɛ adwene biako.
And it doesn’t work either.	Na ɛnyɛ yiye nso.
It will be like.	Ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ.
I'll go ahead with a few.	Mede kakraa bi bɛkɔ anim.
My father was at a meeting.	Ná me papa wɔ nhyiam bi ase.
Maybe that in itself is strange.	Ebia ɛno ankasa yɛ nwonwa.
I feel like I'm in pain.	Mete nka sɛ me ho ayɛ me yaw.
This letter.	Saa krataa yi.
If you want to.	Sɛ wopɛ a.
It seemed cold.       	Ná ɛte sɛ nea awɔw wom.       
. . . .	.
Just a phone call.	Telefon bi kɛkɛ.
And you’re right about one thing.	Na woayɛ no yiye wɔ ade biako ho.
No one needed to do that.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ obiara yɛ saa.
This house is brand new!	Saa ofie yi yɛ foforo koraa!
You end our hope.	Wode yɛn anidaso no ba awiei.
To be honest with me.	Sɛ mɛka nokware akyerɛ me.
You gave me every part of yourself.	Wo na wode wo ho fã biara maa me.
But he is not the man at this point.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɔno ne ɔbarima no wɔ saa bere yi mu.
I repeat the words over and over again.	Meka nsɛm no mpɛn pii.
Say it will be the last time.	Ka sɛ ɛbɛyɛ bere a etwa to.
No time for doubt.	Bere biara nni hɔ a wɔde begye akyinnye.
The children played in the park.	Mmofra no dii agoru wɔ abɔnten so.
And there was a terrible incident.	Na asɛm bi a ɛyɛ hu sii wɔ hɔ.
I could have had the last shot.	Anka metumi anya tuo a etwa to no.
We can do anything you want.	Yebetumi ayɛ biribiara a wopɛ.
I want you to be better than me.	Mepɛ sɛ woyɛ papa sen me.
And do things.	Na yɛ nneɛma.
There was a lot of excitement.	Ná anigye pii wɔ hɔ.
All the pictures have the same quality.	Mfonini ahorow no nyinaa wɔ su koro.
As the first of these.	Sɛ́ nea edi kan no.
I knew those days were over.	Ná minim sɛ saa nna no aba awiei.
It was the whole story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
He glanced away, but only briefly.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ baabi foforo, nanso bere tiaa bi pɛ.
Don’t let it drop to its feet.	Mma no nkɔ fam nkɔ ne nan so.
He needs to rely more on his shot.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho to ne tuo no so kɛse.
But suppose there is no such thing.	Nanso fa no sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
Here are some pictures.	Mfonini ahorow bi ni.
However, his claim is false.	Nanso, nea ɔka no yɛ atoro.
He did all he could to help.	Ɔyɛɛ nea obetumi biara sɛ ɔbɛboa.
You can, but not me.	Wubetumi, nanso ɛnyɛ me.
That’s how it should be.	Saa ara na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
I just want to believe it.	Mepɛ sɛ migye di ara kwa.
As they say.	Sɛnea wɔka no.
You discussed it with me carefully.	Wo ne me susuw ho yiye.
What’s going on? 	Dɛn na ɛrekɔ so?
I don’t know how much of that is true.	Minnim sɛnea ɛno mu dodow no ara yɛ nokware.
But you will feel really good.	Nanso wo ho bɛtɔ wo ankasa.
Moreover,	Ɛno akyi no,
There would be problems with such a plan.	Ná ɔhaw ahorow bɛba nhyehyɛe a ɛte saa mu.
The party will continue next month.	Apontow no bɛkɔ so ɔsram a edi hɔ no.
Any weird ideas whatever you may have.	Adwene biara a ɛyɛ nwonwa biara a ebia wowɔ.
Two days later, he received his letter again.	Nna abien akyi no, ne nsa kaa ne krataa no bio.
This is always important.	Eyi ho hia bere nyinaa.
He was way ahead of his time.	Ná odi ne bere anim koraa.
We are interested in that.	Yɛn ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
But great power comes at a price.	Nanso tumi kɛse de bo bi ba.
Maybe the idea for this came from me.	Ebia eyi ho adwene no fi me hɔ.
It just has to be you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo ara kwa.
This was certainly not the only reason.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛnyɛ eyi nkutoo ne nea enti a ɔyɛɛ saa.
But there is no help.	Nanso mmoa biara nni hɔ.
Have a great weekend, everyone.	Dapɛn awiei pa, obiara.
I liked his part.	M’ani gyee ne fã no ho.
However, it didn’t work.	Nanso, anyɛ adwuma.
I still don’t do that.	Meda so ara nyɛ saa.
That dress was popular years ago.	Ná nkurɔfo ani gye saa atade no ho mfe bi a atwam ni.
The two of you.	Mo baanu no.
Now he knows better.	Seesei onim yiye.
This was all really too weird.	Ná eyi nyinaa yɛ nwonwa dodo ankasa.
The reality is irrelevant.	Sɛnea ɛte ankasa no ho nhia.
You are more beautiful than your picture.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ sen wo mfonini no.
Everything else was blurry.	Ná biribiara a aka no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
He has a right without us.	Ɔwɔ hokwan a yɛn nka ho.
A pleasure to work with.	Anigye a ɛyɛ sɛ wo ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
It still didn't work.	Ná ɛda so ara ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
My day was over.	Ná me da no aba awiei.
It would only be a month and a year.	Ná ɛbɛyɛ ɔsram ne afe nkutoo.
The dog stared at the moon.	Ɔkraman no hwɛɛ ɔsram no denneennen.
He was surprised at how loud it was.	Sɛnea na ano yɛ den no yɛɛ no ​​nwonwa.
We enjoyed it.	Yɛn ani gyee ho.
I am sorry to say they are true.	Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ meka sɛ wɔyɛ nokware.
Still, many of his best works remained.	Nanso, na ne nnwuma a eye sen biara no pii da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Consider how long that is.	Susuw bere tenten a ɛno yɛ no ho hwɛ.
Or maybe it was just me.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
It sounds like good stuff.	Ɛte sɛ nneɛma pa.
You can put in what you want.	Wubetumi de nea wopɛ no ahyɛ mu.
He spent all his money on food.	Ɔde ne sika nyinaa yɛɛ aduan.
Great house indeed.	Ofie kɛse ampa.
He is planning to take me to the movies.	Ɔreyɛ nhyehyɛe de me akɔ sini.
I can't do that at all tomorrow.	Mintumi nyɛ saa koraa ɔkyena.
It’s your gun.	Ɛyɛ wo tuo.
The child was not here.	Ná abofra no nni ha.
That’s much easier.	Ɛno yɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
But this doesn’t feel like anything like that.	Nanso eyi nte nka sɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
I never know until today.	Minnim da de besi nnɛ.
Make it cheaper.	Ma ne bo nyɛ den.
You have it.	Wowɔ no.
Remember the long game.	Kae agoru tenten no.
I just know how to use my hands.	Minim sɛnea mede me nsa bedi dwuma ara kwa.
The group is strong.	Kuw no mu yɛ den.
I knew that now.	Ná minim saa mprempren.
You take a lot of people with you.	Wode nnipa pii ka wo ho.
I was beautiful.	Ná me ho yɛ fɛ.
It was amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This was difficult.	Ná eyi yɛ den.
I'm here with you.	Me ne wo wɔ ha.
Bringing in an outside perspective.	Abɔnten so adwene a wɔde bɛba.
I think I might have heard something.	Misusuw sɛ ebia na mete biribi.
It didn’t feel like anything.	Na ɛnte nka sɛ ɛyɛ biribiara.
Not likely to bring him in, either.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye sɛ wode no bɛba mu, nso.
They just set up the story.	Wɔde asɛm no sii hɔ ara kwa.
It’s easy, cheap and fast.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw, ne bo nyɛ den na ɛyɛ ntɛm.
I don’t like people.	M’ani nnye nnipa ho.
I could have seen it.	Anka metumi ahu.
I want to believe him.	Mepɛ sɛ migye no di.
These shoes are very comfortable.	Saa mpaboa yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
As long as it exists.	Bere tenten a ɛwɔ hɔ no.
He has a lot in common with them.	Ɔne wɔn wɔ nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ pɛ.
He had no time for household chores.	Ná onni bere biara mma ofie nnwuma.
There should be water on the floor.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nsu wɔ fam hɔ.
Perhaps no one can watch his final moments.	Ebia obiara nni hɔ a obetumi ahwɛ ne bere a etwa to no.
He is innocent.	Onni mfomso biara.
Everyone has a job to do.	Obiara wɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
Take off all your clothes.	Yi wo ntade nyinaa.
This is easier when you practice.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw bere a wode wo ho hyɛ mu no.
We are afraid.	Yɛn suro.
I know it very well.	Minim yiye.
Our furniture is really starting to look old.	Yɛn dan mu nneɛma afi ase reyɛ ayɛ dedaw ankasa.
There was no one else.	Na obiara nni hɔ a ɔbɛka ho.
This was your plan.	Ná eyi ne wo nhyehyɛe.
He ran home.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ fie.
This story has come up.	Saa asɛm yi aba.
I’m so happy to be here.	M’ani agye yiye sɛ mewɔ ha.
And it was very difficult for me.	Na na ɛyɛ den ma me paa.
It will be a great shot.	Ɛbɛyɛ tuo kɛse.
We have the opportunity.	Yɛwɔ hokwan.
Get out of there immediately!	Tu fi hɔ ntɛm ara!
There are also treadmills available.	Wɔde nneɛma a wɔde tu mmirika nso wɔ hɔ.
It was much more glamorous.	Ná ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ sen saa koraa.
The new one.	Foforo no.
But that didn’t happen.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na esii.
You could tell they weren’t happy.	Ná wubetumi ahu sɛ wɔn ani nnye.
This is just the nature of where we are right now.	Eyi yɛ baabi a yɛwɔ mprempren yi ara no su ara kwa.
I'm going to go a little bit.	Me deɛ, mɛkɔ kakra.
That he’s really interested.	Sɛ n’ani gye ho ankasa.
I never wanted anything else from him.	Na mempɛ biribi foforo biara mfi ne hɔ da.
However, much was at stake.	Nanso, na pii da asiane mu.
The rest of the day was spent in bed.	Wɔde da no fã a aka no traa mpa so.
It’s pretty much how things look around my house today.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ sɛnea nneɛma te wɔ me fie ho nnɛ.
I only wanted bigger.	Ná mepɛ kɛse nkutoo.
No one could see the boy.	Ná obiara nhu abarimaa no.
Please don’t just do that.	Mesrɛ wo, nyɛ saa kɛkɛ.
I am here for you.	Mewɔ ha ma wo.
But on those days the police can’t do that.	Nanso saa nna no mu no polisifo ntumi nyɛ saa.
He was his own.	Ná ɔyɛ ne de.
It’s very obvious, and yet.	Ɛda adi yiye, na nanso.
I am very much looking forward to it.	Mehwɛ kwan paa.
That is a first for us.	Ɛno yɛ nea edi kan ma yɛn.
I feel like we were a real team, very close friends.	Mete nka sɛ na yɛyɛ kuw ankasa, na yɛyɛ nnamfo paa.
It would be great if you could help me.	Sɛ wubetumi aboa me a, anka ɛbɛyɛ papa.
Try to make the most of this.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wode eyi bedi dwuma yiye.
There are at least two reasons for this.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, nneɛma abien na enti ɛte saa.
I believe it is mine.	Migye di sɛ ɛyɛ me de.
This alone should hurt.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi nkutoo na ɛyɛ yaw.
I could do nothing.	Ná metumi anyɛ hwee.
He wanted to be with them.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka wɔn ho.
This door can be dangerous.	Saa ɔpon yi betumi ayɛ nea asiane wom.
However, I wanted him to.	Nanso, na mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
That will make it easier for us.	Ɛno bɛma ayɛ mmerɛw ama yɛn.
Actual or cash disbursement.	Sika a wɔde bɛma ankasa anaasɛ sika a wɔde bɛma.
He knows it all, the whole story.	Onim ne nyinaa, asɛm no nyinaa.
I was very busy.	Ná minni adagyew koraa.
The man's character.	Ɔbarima no su.
Not so with mine.	Ɛnyɛ me de no saa.
That would be faster and better.	Ɛno bɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm na ayɛ papa.
They are just as good.	Wɔyɛ papa saa ara.
But the problem quickly escalated.	Nanso ɔhaw no mu yɛɛ den ntɛm ara.
His idea, but not his idea.	N’adwene, nanso ɛnyɛ n’adwene.
I don’t want to.	Mempɛ.
We are here again.	Yɛwɔ ha bio.
Or at least it didn’t do us any harm.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, anyɛ yɛn bɔne biara.
See if anything can fly away.	Hwɛ sɛ biribi betumi atu akɔ anaa.
See me.	Hu me.
She is very bright.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hyew yiye.
I stayed with the first one.	Me ne nea odi kan no traa hɔ.
No one can see me.	Obiara ntumi nhu me.
That would be good.	Ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
Maybe I am not the user.	Ebia menyɛ nea ɔde di dwuma no.
See where that got me.	Hwɛ baabi a ɛno de me baa.
He did everything right.	Ɔyɛɛ biribiara yiye.
Take care of them.	Hwɛ wɔn yiye.
This is what is used most often.	Eyi ne nea wɔde di dwuma mpɛn pii.
Do your homework!	Yɛ wo fie nnwuma!
He has to make his own bed.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa yɛ ne mpa.
It doesn’t matter much.	Ɛho nhia pii.
It may be used multiple times per user, per day.	Ebia wɔde bedi dwuma mpɛn pii wɔ obiara a ɔde di dwuma no mu, da biara.
Paper production is difficult.	Krataa a wɔyɛ no yɛ den.
We had some schools there.	Ná yɛwɔ sukuu ahorow bi wɔ hɔ.
No doubt you have done this before.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ woayɛ eyi pɛn.
Everyone was there.	Ná obiara wɔ hɔ.
That’s not fun.	Ɛno nyɛ anigye.
I don’t know this person.	Minnim onipa yi.
Here’s how we should look in someone’s eyes.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ wɔ obi ani so.
There doesn’t seem to be enough numbers.	Ɛte sɛ nea dodow a ɛdɔɔso nni hɔ.
That would be bad if there was a problem.	Ɛno bɛyɛ bɔne sɛ ɔhaw bi ba a.
I feel that way.	Mete nka saa.
Use the other leg again.	Fa nan foforo no di dwuma bio.
The defendants did not act accidentally.	Wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho too wɔn so no anyɛ ade wɔ akwanhyia mu.
The end of the story.	Asɛm no awiei.
We are short as it is.	Yɛyɛ tiaa sɛnea ɛte no.
It is used to process your input.	Wɔde di dwuma de di wo nsɛm a wode ahyɛ mu no ho dwuma.
I could start over.	Ná metumi afi ase bio.
And so did he, too.	Na saa na ɔno nso.
That’s just the first step.	Ɛno ne ade a edi kan ara kwa.
He was no longer conscious.	Ná onnim hwee bio.
That long walk after dinner.	Saa nantew tenten no wɔ anwummere aduan akyi.
Clothes may be important but books were.	Ebia ntade ho hia nanso na nhoma ho hia.
Unless they are what you are.	Gye sɛ wɔyɛ nea woyɛ.
It was such a fun and easy project.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ anigye na ɛnyɛ den saa.
Not on the legs.	Ɛnyɛ nan no so.
Some days it was really very painful.	Nna bi wɔ hɔ a na ɛyɛ yaw kɛse ankasa.
We would have done that.	Anka yɛbɛyɛ saa.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
The first night was really cold.	Anadwo a edi kan no, na awɔw wom ankasa.
Many thought their time had come.	Nnipa pii susuwii sɛ wɔn bere adu.
But no one noticed.	Nanso obiara anhu.
It’s definitely just a matter of time.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ bere ho asɛm ara kwa.
It’s not a big deal.	Ɛnyɛ ade kɛse.
However, it is very expensive.	Nanso, ne bo yɛ den yiye.
That was so awesome!.	Ná ɛno yɛ hu yiye!.
Such food is not good.	Aduan a ɛte saa no nyɛ papa.
He is a very strong child.	Ɔyɛ abofra a ne ho yɛ den yiye.
I wasn’t in charge of them.	Ná ɛnyɛ me na mehwɛ wɔn so.
I learned some of that from him.	Mihuu saa nneɛma no bi fii ne hɔ.
It’s finally hot outside.	Awiei koraa no, ɛyɛ hyew wɔ abɔnten.
At least not immediately.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ ntɛm ara.
As such he is not here.	Sɛnea ɛte no ara na onni ha.
These shoes are made for walking.	Wɔyɛ saa mpaboa yi ma nantew.
It wasn’t even lunch time.	Ná ɛnyɛ awia aduan bere mpo.
I want to hear everything.	Mepɛ sɛ mete biribiara.
But he did me wrong.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ me bɔne.
That’s a difficult one.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
All the fun is in the dress.	Anigye no nyinaa wɔ atade no mu.
He seemed to be somewhere else.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔwɔ baabi foforo.
But the one city is significant.	Nanso kurow biako no yɛ nea ɛho hia.
It has such power over him.	Ɛwɔ tumi a ɛte saa wɔ ne so.
Also important is when you do any work.	Nea ɛho hia nso ne bere a woyɛ adwuma biara.
The latter condition is more common.	Tebea a etwa to no na abu so kɛse.
Luxury cars are usually expensive.	Mpɛn pii no, kar ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ no bo yɛ den.
There is a	Ɛwɔ hɔ a .
You have to get involved.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu.
They have been going on for years.	Wɔde mfe pii akɔ so.
Consider what that means.	Susuw nea ɛno kyerɛ no ho hwɛ.
I hope you enjoy this post.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye saa krataa yi ho.
She is as happy as can be.	Ɔwɔ anigye sɛnea obetumi.
It’s a wonderful movie.	Ɛyɛ sini a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He has only one leg.	Ɔwɔ nan biako pɛ.
The more extreme the better.	Dodow a wɔyɛ ade tra so no, dodow no ara na eye.
Good or bad it has its day.	Eye anaa bɔne no ɛwɔ ne da.
He did not know what letter he had received.	Ná onnim krataa a ne nsa kaa no.
As a result, we too are disappointed.	Nea afi mu aba ne sɛ yɛn nso yɛn abam abu.
I feel bad for the man.	Mete nka bɔne ma ɔbarima no.
We need to work to reverse this situation.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma de dan tebea yi.
Police detained several people at the scene.	Polisifo de nnipa pii too afiase wɔ baabi a asɛm no sii no.
Fast and strong.	Ntɛmntɛm na ɛyɛ den.
I saw that picture this morning.	Mihuu saa mfonini no anɔpa yi.
I’m interested in it.	M’ani gye ho.
He was always late.	Ná ɔka akyi bere nyinaa.
An unimportant statement.	Asɛm a ɛho nhia.
I was a child at the time.	Saa bere no na meyɛ abofra.
Everyone talks about him.	Obiara ka ne ho asɛm.
Very nice to use.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
It was no longer our pleasure.	Anyɛ yɛn anigye bio.
I just thought maybe he knew this cat.	Misusuwii kɛkɛ sɛ ebia na onim saa ɔkraman yi.
However, it was pretty much the same.	Nanso, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛte saa ara.
The letter should arrive tomorrow.	Ɛsɛ sɛ krataa no ba ɔkyena.
Thank you so, so much.	Meda mo ase saa, pii.
There is nothing left but.	Biribiara nni hɔ a aka gye sɛ.
No further configuration is required.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe foforo biara.
He didn't know what to do, either.	Ná onnim nea ɔnyɛ, nso.
But it’s not a game for me.	Nanso ɛnyɛ agoru ma me.
His hand is on mine.	Ne nsa wɔ me de so.
He loved to walk.	Na n’ani gye nantew ho.
Try walking in some different shoes.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wode mpaboa ahorow bi nantew.
He didn't want to hear it.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔte.
However, they are beautiful in their own way.	Nanso, ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ wɔn ankasa kwan so.
And not just any dress.	Na ɛnyɛ atade biara kɛkɛ.
Maybe another time.	Ebia bere foforo.
There is also a power dynamic at play.	Tumi a ɛyɛ den nso wɔ agoru no mu.
People look at us like animals.	Nkurɔfo hwɛ yɛn sɛ mmoa.
I can go in the morning, if you like.	Metumi akɔ anɔpa, sɛ wopɛ a.
I think this is a perfect picture.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ mfonini a edi mũ.
He took it down all the way.	Ɔde sii fam wɔ kwan no nyinaa so.
I couldn’t think of what to say.	Ná mintumi nsusuw nea mɛka ho.
He was not strong at all.	Ná ɔnyɛ den koraa.
There is no need to do this.	Ɛho nhia sɛ yɛyɛ eyi.
It seems so, anyway.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa, ɔkwan biara so.
Someone else uses it.	Obi foforo na ɔde di dwuma.
The song was a hit that year.	Dwom no gyee din saa afe no.
This is an interesting book.	Eyi yɛ nhoma a ɛyɛ anigye.
But he is a troublemaker.	Nanso ɔyɛ obi a ɔde ɔhaw ba.
I can’t see anything.	Mintumi nhu hwee.
Don’t save them.	Nnye wɔn nkwa.
There were many factors for this.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ ma eyi.
Just keep playing.	Kɔ so di agoru kɛkɛ.
But almost no one has this condition.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ tebea yi nni obiara mu.
It is very large.	Ɛyɛ kɛse yiye.
They are either full or empty.	Wɔyɛ ma anaasɛ hwee nni mu.
There is no other picture quite like it.	Mfonini foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ ɛno koraa.
But it’s all in vain.	Nanso ne nyinaa yɛ kwa.
According to the statements.	Sɛnea nsɛm a wɔka no te.
Never, ever head that way.	Mfa w’ani nkyerɛ saa kwan no so da, da.
You know what’s out there.	Wunim nea ɛwɔ abɔnten hɔ.
I’m very excited about it.	M’ani agye yiye wɔ ho.
There is a lot of information in this movie.	Nsɛm pii wɔ sini yi mu.
Nan looked out the window.	Nan hwɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
Are you sure you want to do this?	So wugye di sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi?
I'm really late.	Meka akyi ankasa.
I know you want children.	Minim sɛ wopɛ mma.
That’s the real thing.	Ɛno ne no ankasa.
That’s usually bad, but in this case it’s really good.	Ɛno taa yɛ bɔne, nanso wɔ eyi mu no eye ankasa.
He says they should forget about each other.	Ɔka sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn werɛ fi wɔn ho wɔn ho.
In the end, though, it was too dangerous.	Nanso, awiei koraa no, na asiane wom dodo.
It’s your right.	Ɛyɛ wo hokwan.
This time, he can be good.	Saa bere yi de, obetumi ayɛ papa.
It’s a good plan.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe pa.
They were good.	Ná wɔyɛ papa.
I could think of nothing else.	Ná mintumi nsusuw biribi foforo biara ho.
There is no phone in the car.	Telefon biara nni kar no mu.
He doesn’t even have a name.	Onni din mpo.
They didn’t have to.	Ná enhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
It has been a long road for me.	Ayɛ ɔkwan tenten ama me.
Things have gone very well.	Nneɛma akɔ so yiye paa.
Just what I want to do the job.	Nea mepɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma no ara kwa.
Be alert to danger.	Ma w’ani nna hɔ wɔ asiane ho.
It was a very dangerous time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a asiane wom paa.
There is an urgent need for greater efficiency.	Ɛho hia ntɛm ara sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma yiye kɛse.
We spent the next few days there.	Yɛde nna kakraa a edi hɔ no traa hɔ.
Simple, but beautiful.	Ɛnyɛ den, nanso ɛyɛ fɛ.
He and his wife live in a simple house.	Ɔne ne yere te ofie a ɛnyɛ den mu.
There is something about the car.	Biribi wɔ kar no ho a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This house is great.	Saa ofie yi yɛ kɛse.
You can just get out of it for too long.	Wubetumi afi mu akyɛ dodo ara kwa.
They just loved it.	Wɔn ani gyee ho ara kwa.
I think the job worked out well.	Misusuw sɛ adwuma no yɛɛ no ​​yiye.
It’s happening every day now.	Ɛrekɔ so da biara da mprempren.
The people will want order now.	Nkurɔfo no bɛpɛ nhyehyɛe mprempren.
He was doing his best to keep up with her.	Ná ɔreyɛ nea obetumi biara sɛ ɔbɛkɔ so ne no abɔ.
I want to know who did this.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu onii a ɔyɛɛ eyi.
I could never have enough time each week.	Na mintumi nnya bere a ɛdɔɔso dapɛn biara da.
The fatal accident happened in the middle of the night.	Akwanhyia a ɛyɛ hu no sii anadwo fã.
That wasn’t necessary.	Ná ɛno ho nhia.
Our team won.	Yɛn kuw no dii nkonim.
It’s as good as it gets.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛnea ɛte no.
They engaged in experimental work.	Wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ sɔhwɛ adwuma mu.
He gave the boy three pictures.	Ɔde mfonini abiɛsa maa abarimaa no.
What is he doing?	Dɛn na ɔreyɛ?
And at that point it hardly mattered.	Na saa bere no na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛho nhia.
And no one else seems to notice.	Na ɛte sɛ nea obi foforo biara nhu.
And that still hurts a little.	Na ɛno da so ara yɛ yaw kakra.
I see the danger.	Mihu asiane no.
Setting the scene quickly is critical.	Sɛ́ wode tebea no besi hɔ ntɛmntɛm no ho hia kɛse.
And, it’s a mistake.	Na, ɛyɛ mfomso.
Which is great at night.	Nea ɛyɛ kɛse anadwo.
But he didn’t know that.	Nanso na onnim saa.
It is up to you to say whether it will.	Ɛyɛ wo na ɛsɛ sɛ woka sɛ ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa anaa.
Give them a reason for it.	Ma wɔn nea enti a ɛte saa.
That’s what’s in the book.	Ɛno ne nea ɛwɔ nhoma no mu.
They are rare.	Wɔn ho yɛ na.
It shouldn’t be painful.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yaw.
He was gone most of the time.	Ná onni hɔ bere dodow no ara.
He had a first impression of the course.	Na ɔwɔ adwene a edi kan wɔ adesua no ho.
This is where you can start.	Eyi ne baabi a wubetumi afi ase.
Maybe none of it is needed anymore.	Ebia mu biara ho nhia bio.
He spent two days in bed.	Ɔde nna abien traa mpa so.
That’s pretty inexpensive.	Ɛno yɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den koraa.
But she is my wife.	Nanso ɔyɛ me yere.
I know you have work to do.	Minim sɛ wowɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho.
None of them are successful.	Wɔn mu biara ntumi nyɛ yiye.
This shouldn’t take long.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi gye bere tenten.
So, what happened next.	Enti, nea esii akyi.
Rely.	Fa wo ho to so.
He could have said that easily.	Ná obetumi aka saa a ɛnyɛ den.
You have to do this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi.
More importantly, the look is never perfect.	Nea ɛho hia sen saa no, sɛnea ɛte no nyɛ pɛ da.
After all, it wasn’t so bad as it sounds.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na ɛnyɛ bɔne kɛse sɛnea ɛte no.
I was too young.	Ná meyɛ abofra dodo.
There seemed to be no reason for it.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Everyone seems to.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara.
Unless it’s a big project.	Gye sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse bi.
I have brought it upon us.	Mede aba yɛn so.
It is not a realistic plan.	Ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe a ɛyɛ nokware.
Time goes really fast.	Bere kɔ ntɛmntɛm ankasa.
His children, too.	Ne mma nso.
No doubt he was.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔyɛ saa.
I’m so excited to keep doing that.	M’ani agye yiye sɛ mɛkɔ so ayɛ saa.
Feel and watch.	Te nka na hwɛ.
I do know, there is a place in it.	Minim ampa, baabi wɔ mu.
You don’t like that one.	W’ani nnye saa biako no ho.
He had worked with her for three years.	Ná ɔne no ayɛ adwuma mfe abiɛsa.
Tonight is one of those nights.	Anadwo yi yɛ saa anadwo no mu biako.
He really wanted to do that.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa ampa.
So you can see what is really going on.	Enti wubetumi ahu nea ɛrekɔ so ankasa.
It was the same thing now.	Ná ɛyɛ ade koro no ara mprempren.
In three experiments.	Wɔ sɔhwɛ ahorow abiɛsa mu.
The reason for this is unclear.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no mu nna hɔ.
And he will do so.	Na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
Mother came in.	Maame baa mu.
People are well used to it.	Nkurɔfo ayɛ wɔn su yiye.
I’m interested in stories.	M’ani gye nsɛm ho.
I just don’t believe in all that stuff.	Me nnye saa nneɛma no nyinaa nni kɛkɛ.
Only if it doesn’t matter to you.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ wo asɛm nkutoo a.
It was too unlikely.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye dodo.
He had no friends.	Ná onni nnamfo biara.
He lived with his mother.	Ná ɔte ne maame nkyɛn.
He had no fancy clothes.	Ná onni ntade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
But when delivered, it works well for all involved.	Nanso sɛ wɔde ma a, ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ma wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu nyinaa.
People like us need to know that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nnipa te sɛ yɛn hu saa.
So, that was it then.	Enti, ɛno ne no saa bere no.
And I do, every night.	Na meyɛ, anadwo biara.
Plenty of time to give.	Bere pii a wɔde bɛma.
But this was the big city.	Nanso na eyi ne kurow kɛse no.
I couldn't drive something like that.	Ná mintumi mfa biribi a ɛte saa nka kar.
A man was sitting at the table.	Ná ɔbarima bi te pon no ho.
It’s not as complicated as it sounds.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den sɛnea ɛte no.
Jobs were not for everyone.	Ná nnwuma nyɛ obiara de.
I am still you .	Meda so ara yɛ wo .
There’s a lot on the weekly menu.	Nneɛma pii wɔ dapɛn dapɛn aduan a wɔde ma no mu.
Nothing is past.	Biribiara nni hɔ a atwam.
Take both now.	Fa abien no nyinaa mprempren.
People don’t seem to get it right.	Ɛte sɛ nea nkurɔfo ntumi nte ase yiye.
Many people will be interested in me.	Nnipa pii ani begye me.
I have worked there.	Mayɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ.
We must not forget.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛn werɛ fi.
There was only one man who could do it.	Ná ɔbarima biako pɛ na ɔwɔ hɔ a obetumi ayɛ no.
He loves going to the movies.	N’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛkɔ sini.
They were spectacular.	Ná wɔyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I really like this game.	M’ani gye saa agoru yi ho yiye.
I don’t know his last name.	Minnim ne din a etwa to.
Or his for hers.	Anaasɛ ne de ma ne de.
Very few people work in this industry.	Nnipa kakraa bi pɛ na wɔyɛ adwuma wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
It remains one of my all-time favorite films.	Ɛda so ara yɛ sini ahorow a m’ani gye ho bere nyinaa no mu biako.
It’s not the same job.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma koro no ara.
I want to add it.	Mepɛ sɛ mede ka ho.
What a man he is.	Dɛn na ɔyɛ ɔbarima.
That was not a carry-on.	Ná ɛno nyɛ ade a wɔde fa nneɛma.
A few days with him was great.	Nna kakra ne no yɛɛ kɛse.
The temptation was too great.	Ná sɔhwɛ no yɛ kɛse dodo.
Keep going and you will be fine.	Kɔ so na wobɛyɛ yiye.
He has a mistake.	Ɔwɔ mfomso bi.
And I’m excited.	Na m’ani agye.
There are so many things to do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
No one else, either.	Obiara nni hɔ, nso.
You know your room.	Wunim wo dan mu.
The water is heating up.	Nsu no rebɔ hyew.
He had just enough money to go home.	Ná ɔwɔ sika a ɛdɔɔso ara kwa a ɔde bɛkɔ fie.
The dog looked at the cat closely.	Ɔkraman no hwɛɛ ɔkraman no yiye.
Happiness flowed through him.	Anigye sen faa ne mu.
I didn’t want to tell him how good it was for him.	Na mempɛ sɛ mɛka sɛnea eye ma no no kyerɛ no.
And nothing is still the same problem.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛda so ara yɛ ɔhaw koro no ara.
And maybe you are one.	Na ebia woyɛ biako.
There were many more.	Ná pii nso wɔ hɔ.
Not that most people saw them.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ nnipa dodow no ara huu wɔn.
I'm here with you.	Me ne wo wɔ ha.
I had a great idea.	Ná mewɔ adwene kɛse bi.
You will do some work.	Wobɛyɛ adwuma bi.
He was everything he wanted to be and people wanted to be with him.	Ná ɔyɛ biribiara a ɔpɛ na na nkurɔfo pɛ sɛ ɔne no bɔ.
That didn’t surprise me at all.	Ɛno anyɛ me nwonwa koraa.
Everyone in the room knew what must have happened.	Ná obiara a ɔwɔ dan no mu nim nea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ asi.
Maybe just my mom.	Ebia me maame nkutoo.
I hope you enjoy them.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye wɔn ho.
The dog should lie down.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkraman no da fam.
The man kept approaching.	Onipa no kɔɔ so bɛn no.
Many lives are at stake.	Nkwa pii wɔ asiane mu.
This currency should not create another currency.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ saa sika yi bɔ sika foforo.
Mine is pretty simple.	Me de no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
I wondered where I would go.	Misusuw baabi a mɛkɔ ho.
Never.	Da.
Be your best self'.	Yɛ wo ho a eye sen biara'.
Not really a big problem in that case.	Ɛnyɛ ɔhaw kɛse ankasa wɔ saa tebea no mu.
The meeting was a splendid one.	Ná nhyiam no yɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I have done a very good job.	Mayɛ adwuma pa ara.
That was certainly true.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛno yɛ nokware.
There was nothing.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ.
Only you know.	Wo nkutoo na wunim.
No one need bother him, he told me.	Obiara nhia sɛ ɔhaw no, ɔka kyerɛɛ me.
This thing or that thing is an idea.	Saa ade yi anaa saa ade no yɛ adwene bi.
Otherwise, an error will occur.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, mfomso bi bɛba.
The animal is a squirrel.	Aboa no yɛ ɔkraman.
I don't know what the problem is.	Minnim ɔhaw no ne dɛn.
I'm pretty sure everyone goes through that from time to time.	Migye di yiye sɛ obiara fa saa asɛm no mu bere ne bere mu.
But that’s unlikely to be the case out here.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye sɛ ɛno na ɛwɔ ha akyi.
I hear the other one is actually the food.	Mete sɛ foforo no yɛ aduan no ankasa.
You may actually be a target.	Ebia wobɛyɛ obi a wɔde w’ani asi wo so ankasa.
The music industry has certainly recognized that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nnwom adwuma no ahu sɛ ɛte saa.
We got the car down.	Yɛde kar no sii fam.
We can all do our part to innovate.	Yɛn nyinaa betumi ayɛ yɛn fam de de ayɛ nneɛma foforo.
That was one of them.	Ná ɛno yɛ biako.
You take what you can with you where you can get it.	Wode nea wubetumi de kɔ baabi a wubetumi anya.
That was clear enough.	Ná ɛno mu da hɔ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
These qualities indicate perfection.	Saa su ahorow yi kyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ pɛ.
They loved to play with food.	Ná wɔn ani gye ho sɛ wɔde aduan bedi agoru.
Their beautiful faces showed.	Ná wɔn anim a ɛyɛ fɛ no kyerɛ.
And the hottest of all.	Na nea ɛyɛ hyew sen biara.
You know you will.	Wunim sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
Take it there.	Fa kɔ hɔ.
They nodded back.	Wɔde wɔn ti too fam san wɔn akyi.
And you do the same thing.	Na wo nso woyɛ saa ara.
What an incident it must have been.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ asɛm a esii.
Like the school thing.	Te sɛ sukuu ade no.
This is for both of you.	Eyi yɛ ma mo baanu nyinaa.
We need to do something, and fast!	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ biribi, na yɛyɛ ntɛm!
But there was something even better.	Nanso na biribi a eye sen saa mpo wɔ hɔ.
The car is	Kar no
The whole system.	Nhyehyɛe no nyinaa.
At least stay alive.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, tra ase.
Somehow his hand touched the road.	Ɔkwan bi so no ne nsa kae ɔkwan no.
I will be more comfortable with myself.	Me ho bɛtɔ me kɛse wɔ me ho.
Not that any of them were left anymore.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na wɔn mu biara aka bio.
For me, it’s something else.	Me de, ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
You all know him, he just wants to play.	Mo nyinaa nim no, ɔpɛ sɛ ɔbɔ kɛkɛ.
It’s a part of me.	Ɛyɛ me fã bi.
He didn't know why.	Ná onnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Just pay attention to what’s going on.	Hwɛ nea ɛrekɔ so no yiye kɛkɛ.
I loved food.	Ná m’ani gye aduan ho.
It was lunch time.	Ná ɛyɛ awia aduan bere.
But no one told them.	Nanso obiara anka ankyerɛ wɔn.
The two sides of the story looked at each other.	Asɛm no fã abien no hwɛɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
This is a very good car.	Eyi yɛ kar a eye paa.
I was filled with pictures.	Mfonini ahorow hyɛɛ me ma.
Or both of them.	Anaasɛ abien no nyinaa.
I have to go soon.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ ntɛm.
Always be part of his talk.	Bere nyinaa yɛ ne kasa no fã.
But soon his father would be at the door.	Nanso bere tiaa bi akyi no na ne papa bɛba ɔpon no ano.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni ho.
The dog fell back to his feet.	Ɔkraman no san hwee ase wɔ ne nan so.
In the past, they did.	Bere bi a atwam no, na wɔyɛ saa.
I know what that looks like.	Minim sɛnea ɛno te.
He had beautiful things.	Ná ɔwɔ nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ.
A feature of most music.	Ade bi a ɛwɔ nnwom dodow no ara mu.
There are very few things one can say that about.	Nneɛma kakraa bi pɛ na obi betumi aka ho asɛm saa.
That was important.	Ná ɛno ho hia.
This is critical to success.	Eyi ho hia kɛse na ama ayɛ yiye.
It was not difficult at all.	Ná ɛnyɛ den koraa.
Perhaps e.g.	Ebia s.e.
He was just too strong.	Ná ne ho yɛ den dodo ara kwa.
Not that it seems to matter.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛho hia.
That’s just another day, another year, another day.	Ɛno yɛ da foforo, afe foforo, da foforo ara kwa.
That time is over.	Saa bere no aba awiei.
Just talk about it.	Ka ho asɛm kɛkɛ.
This was true for both products.	Ná eyi yɛ nokware wɔ nneɛma abien no nyinaa ho.
The summer is only a matter of time.	Awɔw bere no yɛ bere tiaa bi pɛ.
He knows it’s not good for him.	Onim sɛ ɛnyɛ papa mma no.
But that may be going a little too far.	Nanso ebia ɛno rekɔ akyiri dodo kakra.
I never want you to do anything else.	Mempɛ sɛ woyɛ biribi foforo biara da.
His father turns back to the house.	Ne papa dan ne ho san kɔ fie hɔ.
It seems to work great so far.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse de besi nnɛ.
Put it that way.	Fa to hɔ saa.
I never wanted to, you know.	Na mempɛ da, wunim.
What do you think of my new shoes?	Dɛn na wususuw wɔ me mpaboa foforo no ho?
But not each other.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
It is declining for two reasons.	Nneɛma abien nti na ɛrekɔ fam.
No one can do you.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ wo.
He did well with it.	Ɔyɛɛ yiye wɔ ho.
I don’t know why that is.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Eventually something had to give.	Awiei koraa no na ɛsɛ sɛ biribi de ma.
This is a whole new thing for me.	Eyi yɛ ade foforo koraa ma me.
Time was running out.	Ná bere rekɔ so ayɛ tiaa.
He’s in here.	Ɔwɔ ha mu.
Someone will come.	Obi bɛba.
He was surprised by how cold it was outside.	Sɛnea na awɔw wom wɔ abɔnten no maa ne ho dwiriw no.
Everyone has to do their part.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara yɛ ne fam de.
It has to be one or the other.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ biako anaa foforo.
Many did so very quickly.	Pii yɛɛ saa ntɛmntɛm paa.
Place the ingredients in this order.	Fa nneɛma a wɔde yɛ aduan no hyɛ nhyehyɛe yi mu.
He doesn't know there's a problem unless everyone tells him.	Onnim sɛ ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ gye sɛ obiara ka kyerɛ no.
He does understand.	Ɔte ase ampa.
Maybe I don’t think so.	Ebia m’adwene nyɛ saa.
I still often do that.	Meda so ara taa yɛ saa.
I want to work for you.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma ma wo.
This is a different approach.	Eyi yɛ ɔkwan foforo.
This is not a time for fun.	Eyi nyɛ bere a wɔde gye wɔn ani.
I think he’ll like it.	Misusuw sɛ n’ani begye ho.
The city was not a big city.	Ná kurow no nyɛ kurow kɛse.
Understand yourself well.	Te wo ase yiye.
It’s a team game.	Ɛyɛ kuw agoru.
Pii ampa.	Pii ampa.
He put his hand on the table.	Ɔde ne nsa too pon no so.
He paints the background.	Ɔyɛ akyi mfonini.
That lives down there.	Ɛno te ase hɔ wɔ hɔ.
They were both in bed.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa da mpa so.
He started with something.	Ɔde biribi fii ase.
The child was innocent.	Ná abofra no nni asɛm biara wɔ mu.
No one should be able to.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara.
But it’s not their job.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wɔn adwuma.
But he really was the same guy.	Nanso na ɔyɛ ɔbarima koro no ara ampa.
Otherwise, there is no issue.	Anyɛ saa a, asɛm biara nni hɔ.
If he ever does that.	Sɛ ɔyɛ saa da bi a.
Consider the following scenario.	Susuw asɛm a edi so yi ho hwɛ.
Certainly not.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
Which is human.	Nea ɛyɛ nnipa.
Don’t let him sleep.	Mma no nna.
Just make it immediate.	Ma ɛnyɛ ntɛm ara kɛkɛ.
Insert it thoroughly.	Fa ahyɛ mu yiye.
I’m not sure what to do.	M’ani gyee ho.
Someone needs to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi hu.
Work.	Adwuma.
Or maybe it was just me.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
Tell him about it later.	Ka ho asɛm kyerɛ no akyiri yi.
The man was handsome.	Ná ɔbarima no ho yɛ fɛ.
However, there is more to this.	Nanso, nneɛma pii wɔ eyi mu.
He gave it to me.	Ɔde maa me.
I really hope he does well.	Mewɔ anidaso ankasa sɛ ɔbɛyɛ yiye.
At least for the kids.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ mmofra no fam.
The scenery is beautiful.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ fɛ.
He will give it to you.	Ɔde bɛma wo.
He knows you.	Onim wo.
The pain is there.	Yaw no wɔ hɔ.
You were absolutely right this time.	Na woayɛ no yiye koraa saa bere yi.
Let me do it.	Ma menyɛ.
That was the first time.	Ná ɛno ne bere a edi kan.
So they say.	Enti wɔka sɛ.
The story is out there.	Asɛm no wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
There is nothing you can do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
That’s true of any job.	Saa na ɛte wɔ adwuma biara ho.
Presumably, if he wanted it that way.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ, sɛ na ɔpɛ no saa.
I have no problem with them.	Me ne wɔn nni ɔhaw biara.
My dad doesn’t like it.	Me papa ani nnye ho.
And for now, it doesn’t matter.	Na seesei deɛ, ɛnyɛ hwee.
I really, really like him.	M’ani gye ne ho paa, paa.
I knew he would.	Ná minim sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
There are flaws in everything man has done.	Mfomso ahorow wɔ biribiara a onipa ayɛ mu.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea eyi nte saa.
Maybe just not immediately.	Ebia ɛnyɛ ntɛm ara kɛkɛ.
This is before us now.	Eyi te saa wɔ yɛn anim mprempren.
Tell him about it.	Ka kyerɛ no.
Your hair is beautiful today.	Wo ti nhwi yɛ fɛ nnɛ.
It’s not like you’re doing it wrong.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ woreyɛ no bɔne.
I have a few ideas and they might work.	Mewɔ adwene kakraa bi na ebia ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
They speak many languages	Wɔka kasa ahorow pii
People wore party hats.	Ná nkurɔfo hyɛ apontow kyɛw.
I didn’t want to hear it again.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete bio.
It looks pretty cool.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Think about it carefully.	Susuw ho yiye.
Such is the situation in the instant case.	Saa na tebea no te wɔ asɛm a ɛwɔ hɔ ntɛm ara no mu.
I have nowhere to go.	Minni baabi a mɛkɔ.
Get involved in this project.	Fa wo ho hyɛ adwuma yi mu.
He just thinks that’s the best.	Osusuw ara kwa sɛ ɛno ne nea eye sen biara.
This number can be positive or negative.	Saa dodow yi betumi ayɛ papa anaasɛ bɔne.
I wanted two this year.	Ná mepɛ sɛ wɔyɛ abien afe yi.
I never knew so little about myself.	Ná minnim me ho nsɛm kakraa bi saa da.
They range in size from .	Wɔn kɛse fi .
But it was his fault.	Nanso na ɛyɛ ne mfomso.
Traffic travels much faster in the city.	Kar tu kwan ntɛmntɛm kɛse wɔ kurow no mu.
But it doesn’t matter now.	Nanso ɛnyɛ hwee mprempren.
That always works for me.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma ma me bere nyinaa.
He knew nothing now.	Na onnim hwee seesei.
The weekend turns into a week.	Dapɛn awiei no dan dapɛn biako.
This keeps prices down.	Eyi ma nneɛma bo da so ara kɔ fam.
Most don’t even do it themselves.	Dodow no ara mpo wɔn ankasa nyɛ.
Those days are over for me.	Saa nna no atwam ama me.
So many years ago now.	Enti mfe pii a atwam ni mprempren.
He did absolutely that.	Ɔyɛɛ saa koraa.
But it is not so user-friendly.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma saa.
We relied on pictures.	Yɛde yɛn ho too mfonini ahorow so.
He has done good.	Wayɛ papa.
To make you happy.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a w’ani begye.
It’s not the end.	Ɛnyɛ awiei.
I have quite a few hairs as it is.	Mewɔ ti nhwi kakraa bi a ɛdɔɔso sɛnea ɛte no.
But otherwise, his plan is quite complicated.	Nanso sɛ ɛnte saa a, ne nhyehyɛe no yɛ den koraa.
What language do you speak?	Kasa bɛn na woka?
It was very beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Lots of cars in use.	Kar pii a wɔde di dwuma.
There are a few reasons why.	Nneɛma kakraa bi nti na yɛyɛ saa.
I almost felt happy for him.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ metee nka sɛ m’ani agye ama no.
No money is needed.	Sika biara ho nhia.
I have been doing this for years.	Mayɛ eyi mfe pii ni.
I couldn’t believe this had happened so fast.	Na mintumi nnye nni sɛ eyi asi ntɛmntɛm saa.
There is a danger in that arrangement.	Asiane bi wɔ saa nhyehyɛe no mu.
Which is good for me.	Nea eye ma me.
Her hair was terrible.	Ná ne ti nhwi yɛ hu.
I’m happy today.	M’ani agye nnɛ.
Your friends still need you.	Wo nnamfo da so ara hia wo.
You laid it out for him.	Wode too hɔ maa no.
What two people they are.	Nnipa baanu bɛn ara ni.
Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.	Mma obiara nka nkyerɛ wo sɛ ɛnte saa.
But there is something else.	Nanso biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
But in one case.	Nanso wɔ tebea biako mu.
It’s like you’re really there.	Ɛte sɛ nea wowɔ hɔ ankasa.
There were things that needed to be done.	Ná nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He was interested in everything.	Ná n’ani gye biribiara ho.
However, this article is not that car.	Nanso, asɛm yi nyɛ saa kar no.
There is nothing for us there.	Biribiara nni hɔ mma yɛn wɔ hɔ.
An idea struck him then.	Adwene bi bɔɔ no saa bere no.
The timeline shows when people lived.	Bere nhyehyɛe no kyerɛ bere a nkurɔfo traa ase.
But there are many factors to consider.	Nanso nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
And there are many reasons for this.	Na nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
The one in the back looked like a police car.	Ná nea ɔwɔ akyi no te sɛ polisifo kar.
But no one does anything.	Nanso obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ biribiara.
However, it’s obviously not quite as simple as that.	Nanso, ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ mmerɛw koraa te sɛ ɛno.
It would be his last week.	Ná ɛbɛyɛ ne dapɛn a etwa to.
I'm sorry, but .	Mepa wo kyɛw, nanso .
I thought about the situation.	Misusuw tebea no ho.
It was absolutely amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
Those were exciting years.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfe a ɛyɛ anigye.
That’s it for our friends this week.	Ɛno na ɛyɛ ma yɛn dapɛn yi nnamfo.
That’s just wrong in my opinion.	Ɛno yɛ mfomso ara kwa wɔ m’adwene mu.
Finally, the children came home.	Awiei koraa no, mmofra no baa fie.
But there is one condition.	Nanso tebea biako wɔ hɔ.
No one can defeat us.	Obiara ntumi nni yɛn so nkonim.
It was the winter year.	Ná ɛyɛ awɔw bere mu afe no.
Just telling him how it is.	Ka a wobɛka akyerɛ no ara kwa sɛnea ɛte.
This seems to be very important to him.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi ho hia no paa.
That’s what it is.	Ɛno ne saa.
Just use your head instead of your money.	Fa wo ti di dwuma kɛkɛ sen sɛ wode wo sika bedi dwuma.
But he knew nothing about it.	Nanso na onnim ho hwee.
It’s my favorite movie of all time.	Ɛyɛ sini a m’ani gye ho sen biara wɔ bere nyinaa mu.
I was like an extra man.	Ná mete sɛ ɔbarima a ɔka ho.
It was a truly terrible night.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo a ɛyɛ hu ankasa.
He liked them too.	N’ani gyee wɔn nso ho.
That’s your nature.	Ɛno ne wo su.
The man has a presence.	Ɔbarima no wɔ baabi a ɔwɔ.
This is working well.	Eyi reyɛ adwuma yiye.
He looked after them himself.	Ɔno ankasa hwɛɛ wɔn.
He was involved in it.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
The present narrative is such a story.	Mprempren asɛm a wɔka no yɛ asɛm a ɛte saa.
I played with him.	Me ne no dii agoru.
I want to do this more than anything.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi sen biribiara.
When he’s good, he’s really good.	Sɛ ɔyɛ papa a, ɔyɛ papa ankasa.
To make you feel better right now.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wo ho bɛtɔ wo mprempren ara.
Or any household.	Anaasɛ ofie biara.
I hope everything works out for you.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ biribiara bɛyɛ yiye ama wo.
But we seem to be in it.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea yɛwɔ mu.
He might have taken home the rest.	Ebia na ɔde nea aka no akɔ fie.
Lots of power available.	Tumi pii a ɛwɔ hɔ.
The man in the house would do the same.	Ná ɔbarima a ɔwɔ fie hɔ no nso bɛyɛ saa ara.
That was two years ago.	Ɛno yɛ mfe abien a atwam ni.
I think he puts a lot into his schedule.	Misusuw sɛ ɔde nneɛma pii hyɛ ne nhyehyɛe mu.
So you don't even know if this will even work.	Enti wunnim mpo sɛ ebia eyi bɛyɛ adwuma mpo anaa.
It’s quick and easy to do.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm na ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ.
None of them worked.	Wɔn mu biara anyɛ adwuma.
Many children never go to school.	Mmofra pii nkɔ sukuu da.
I loved the language of food.	Ná m’ani gyee kasa a wɔka wɔ aduan ho no ho.
And no one could ever help their own kind.	Na na obiara ntumi mmoa wɔn ankasa su da.
I enjoyed my time here.	M’ani gyee bere a na mewɔ ha no ho.
Not that month.	Ɛnyɛ saa ɔsram no.
This is a controversial issue.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a asɛm wɔ ho.
Check out a few below.	Hwɛ kakraa bi wɔ ase hɔ.
But he is no more.	Nanso onni hɔ bio.
Who was he, anyway? 	Ná ɔyɛ hena?
But it is obviously not true.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ nokware.
Do your best to do it.	Yɛ nea wubetumi biara.
Except it wasn’t.	Gye sɛ na ɛnte saa.
I was doing new things.	Ná mereyɛ nneɛma foforo.
He was a strong man.	Ná ne ho yɛ den.
The same day.	Da koro no ara.
Now this is about you and me.	Seesei eyi fa me ne wo ho.
He was doing a lot of things.	Ná ɔreyɛ nneɛma pii.
And he knew mine.	Na na onim me de no.
So, he could also interfere with the idea.	Enti, na obetumi nso de ne ho agye adwene no mu.
Most people are involved in a project.	Nnipa dodow no ara de wɔn ho hyɛ adwuma bi mu.
But you know, maybe he didn’t like it or something.	Nanso wunim, ebia na n’ani nnye ho anaa biribi.
This is not his character.	Eyi nyɛ ne su.
I saw him.	Mihuu no.
There must be a.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
Things would be great.	Anka nneɛma bɛyɛ kɛse.
My work clothes are very simple.	Me ntade a mede yɛ adwuma no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
You have enough of it.	Wowɔ nea ɛdɔɔso.
I enjoyed doing it so much.	M’ani gyee ho kɛse sɛ mɛyɛ no.
His father was long gone.	Ná ne papa nni hɔ bere tenten.
children are the last.	mma ne nea etwa to.
Get out, get out.	Fi adi, fi adi.
That was nothing to me.	Ná ɛno nyɛ hwee wɔ me fam.
I just didn’t know it when I was a kid.	Ná minnim kɛkɛ bere a na meyɛ abofra no.
The bed is very comfortable.	Mpa no mu yɛ den yiye.
It was not my favorite.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea m’ani gye ho kɛse.
The school team made a few mistakes.	Sukuu kuw no dii mfomso kakraa bi.
A whole new situation lies ahead.	Tebea foforo koraa da yɛn anim.
There was always someone in the room with him.	Ná obi ne no wɔ dan no mu bere nyinaa.
I like the risk.	M’ani gye asiane a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho.
I could be wrong about that.	Metumi adi mfomso wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Don’t play with him.	Mma wo ne no nni agoru.
I think this might be the reason.	Misusuw sɛ ebia eyi ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
These people don’t matter to you.	Saa nnipa yi ho nhia wo.
You want to take your time.	Wopɛ sɛ wugye wo bere.
In our minds.	Wɔ yɛn adwene mu.
He feels strongly.	Ɔte nka denneennen.
That was a good day.	Ná ɛno yɛ da pa.
The party was very successful.	Apontow no dii yiye yiye.
We are very close friends.	Yɛyɛ nnamfo paa.
He looked around the room.	N’ani kyerɛɛ dan no mu.
His mind was clear, but not real.	Ná n’adwene mu da hɔ, nanso na ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
He wanted too much.	Ná ɔpɛ nneɛma pii dodo.
Just one of many.	Nnipa pii mu biako pɛ.
His mother tried her best to help him.	Ne maame bɔɔ mmɔden biara sɛ ɔbɛboa no.
He glanced out the window.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
Not the terrible time.	Ɛnyɛ bere a ɛyɛ hu no.
I put my trust in it.	Mede ne ho too so.
Want to know what it looks like?	Wopɛ sɛ wuhu sɛnea ɛte?
He wasn’t weak.	Ná ɔnyɛ mmerɛw.
They shouldn’t have done that either.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa nso.
It’s their habit.	Ɛyɛ wɔn su.
But he couldn’t do it himself.	Nanso ɔno ankasa antumi anyɛ.
How we could probably have been friends.	Hwɛ sɛnea ebia anka yebetumi ayɛ nnamfo.
Everything seems to matter.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara ho hia.
There’s a lot of that here.	Ɛno mu pii wɔ ha.
Give it to him.	Ma no.
The details are below.	Nsɛm no ho nsɛm wɔ ase ha.
This is such an interesting concept.	Eyi yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ anigye saa.
He’s a wonderful guy.	Ɔyɛ nwonwa.
I have a serious problem.	Mewɔ ɔhaw kɛse bi.
You can check that out right here.	Wubetumi ahwɛ saa asɛm no wɔ ha yi ara.
He would enjoy this for as long as he could.	Ná n’ani begye eyi ho bere tenten biara a obetumi.
First, what are his plans.	Nea edi kan no, dɛn ne ne nhyehyɛe ahorow.
It’s a simple truth.	Ɛyɛ nokware a ɛnyɛ den.
And he did know.	Na na onim ampa.
You have been a great help.	Woayɛ mmoa kɛse.
Think about it, he told himself.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ, susuw ho yiye.
Whatever this is.	Nea eyi yɛ biara.
These things are similar.	Saa nneɛma yi te saa ara.
This is quick and easy.	Eyi yɛ ntɛmntɛm na ɛnyɛ den.
It’s bad for people, and it’s bad for businesses.	Ɛyɛ bɔne ma nkurɔfo, na ɛyɛ bɔne ma nnwuma ahorow.
Don’t care what you think.	Mma nea wususuw ho no mfa ho.
However, there are random things here.	Nanso, nneɛma a wɔyɛ no kwa wɔ ha.
I doubt it will be anything good.	Migye kyim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ biribi pa biara.
This girl wants everything.	Abeawa yi pɛ biribiara.
I wish he could.	Me yam a anka obetumi.
This presents a wonderful opportunity.	Eyi de hokwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa ba.
Once he was someone else.	Bere bi na ɔyɛ obi foforo.
The opportunity must be seized.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde hokwan no di dwuma.
Some things just happened.	Nneɛma bi sii ara kwa.
He really wants his wife to cooperate.	Nea ɔpɛ ankasa ne sɛ ne yere bɛyɛ biako.
This applied to new and old games as well.	Ná eyi fa agoru foforo ne dedaw nso ho.
I know you got one.	Minim sɛ wo nsa kaa biako.
The first week went well.	Dapɛn a edi kan no kɔɔ so yiye.
You have to be interested in it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye ho.
I don’t know what else to believe.	Minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ migye di bio.
But he has a problem.	Nanso ɔwɔ ɔhaw bi.
Everyone is interested in it.	Obiara ani gye ho.
It was much better than that.	Ná eye sen saa koraa.
That doesn’t matter.	Ɛno ho nhia.
These things are only part of the picture.	Saa nneɛma yi yɛ mfonini no fã bi kɛkɛ.
Give it a go, you might like it.	Ma no kɔ, ebia w’ani begye ho.
None of these things are bad things by any means.	Saa nneɛma yi mu biara nyɛ nneɛma bɔne ɔkwan biara so.
This house was very large.	Ná ofie yi yɛ kɛse paa.
That is a difficult task.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den.
I just just didn’t really know what he was doing.	Na minnim nea ɔreyɛ no ankasa kɛkɛ kɛkɛ.
Maybe it was better this way.	Ebia na eye saa kwan yi so.
Perhaps he did at one time.	Ebia ɔyɛɛ saa bere bi.
It’s all amazing.	Ne nyinaa yɛ nwonwa.
He's doing the best he can.	Ɔreyɛ nea eye sen biara a obetumi.
This is still a test.	Eyi da so ara yɛ sɔhwɛ.
It looks really good on her.	Ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa wɔ ne so.
I don’t know where he is.	Minnim baabi a ɔwɔ.
I wasn’t too surprised, though.	Nanso, anyɛ me nwonwa dodo.
The car was irrelevant now.	Ná kar no ho nhia mprempren.
People filled the room.	Nkurɔfo de wɔn ho hyɛɛ dan no mu.
But it’s not mine.	Nanso ɛnyɛ me de.
I have set it to false and it now works.	Mede asi hɔ sɛ atoro na seesei ɛyɛ adwuma.
It’s not too big.	Ɛnyɛ kɛse dodo.
You have to come back with me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne me san ba.
The animals were fascinated.	Mmoa no ani gyee wɔn ho.
He is not a man for words.	Ɔnyɛ onipa ma nsɛm.
My kids need me.	Me mma hia me.
It should be fun.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
The details are here.	Nsɛm no mu nsɛm wɔ ha.
However, he used it well.	Nanso, ɔde dii dwuma yiye.
At least my kids were gone.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na me mma no nni hɔ.
You have to get involved.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu.
Really.	Pa ara.
I feel so lucky.	Mete nka sɛ mewɔ anigye kɛse.
This is a great game.	Eyi yɛ agoru kɛse.
I put her on her bed and tucked her inside.	Mede no too ne mpa so na mede no too mu.
Maybe not later.	Ebia ɛnyɛ akyiri yi.
Use of various controls.	Nneɛma ahorow a wɔde di dwuma a wɔde di dwuma.
There is nothing more difficult.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ den sen saa.
Just believe me.	Gye me di kɛkɛ.
Do this, that, or the other.	Yɛ eyi, saa, anaa foforo no.
At least not that he could see.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nea na obetumi ahu.
Do you find that person attractive?	So wuhu sɛ saa onipa no ho yɛ fɛ?
The bigger you are, the more you have to do.	Dodow a woyɛ kɛse no, dodow no ara na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Anyway, back to that night.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, san kɔ saa anadwo no so.
Its a quick first day time, but not quick enough.	Ne da a edi kan bere a ɛyɛ ntɛm, nanso ɛnyɛ ntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
The same goes for supply chains.	Saa ara na nneɛma a wɔde ma nso te.
You are definitely lucky.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wowɔ anigye.
I think anything is possible.	Misusuw sɛ biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye.
I have no information about him.	Minni ne ho nsɛm biara.
Those things got really popular.	Saa nneɛma no gyee din ankasa.
He needed to warm up fast.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ne ho yɛ hyew ntɛmntɛm.
I couldn’t see the details.	Na mintumi nhu nsɛm no mu nsɛm kɔ akyiri.
He would eventually become someone else.	Ná awiei koraa no ɔbɛyɛ obi foforo.
Who doesn’t know how to speak.	Nea onnim kasa.
Last year was a very, very long way.	Afe a etwaam no yɛ kwan tenten paa, paa.
I can barely sleep.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nna.
Neither option is attractive.	Ɔkwan abien no mu biara nyɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
Remember, it is!	Kae sɛ ɛte saa!
That worked well.	Ɛno yɛɛ adwuma yiye.
The point of the story.	Asɛm a ɛwɔ asɛm no mu.
This is the first part of the meal.	Eyi ne aduan no fã a edi kan.
On our own street.	Wɔ yɛn ankasa abɔnten so.
A week later.	Dapɛn biako akyi.
It must be renewed annually.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no foforo afe biara.
Maybe we have.	Ebia na yɛwɔ.
He put them down.	Ɔde wɔn too fam.
The group in front of them.	Kuw a ɛwɔ wɔn anim.
No one had anything to say.	Ná obiara nni asɛm biara a ɔbɛka.
So it’s on its way down again.	Enti ɛwɔ ne kwan so kɔ fam bio.
I know that he knew.	Minim sɛ na onim.
This would also be a mistake.	Eyi nso bɛyɛ mfomso.
There was no time limit.	Ná bere biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ saa.
I have a job, somehow.	Mewɔ adwuma, ɔkwan bi so.
I didn’t want to tell him.	Na mempɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no.
Two of them stayed behind.	Wɔn mu baanu kaa akyi.
I knew what they were.	Ná minim nea wɔyɛ.
There is little interest in this project.	Anigye kakraa bi na ɛwɔ saa adwuma yi ho.
Just forget about it.	Wo werɛ mfi ho ara kwa.
This also makes it more dangerous.	Eyi nso ma ɛyɛ hu kɛse.
I wish it all the best.	Mepɛ sɛ ne nyinaa yɛ yiye.
I know that well enough.	Minim saa yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Check it out and tell us what you think.	Hwɛ mu na ka nea wususuw kyerɛ yɛn.
If you can help.	Sɛ wubetumi aboa a.
That meant only one thing.	Ná ɛno kyerɛ ade biako pɛ.
That’s a real problem right now.	Ɛno yɛ ɔhaw ankasa mprempren.
He didn't seem to know what to do.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onnim nea ɔbɛyɛ.
I am whatever his name was.	Me ne nea na ne din te biara.
There should have been more.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ pii wɔ hɔ.
The group left disappointed.	Kuw no fii hɔ a na wɔn abam abu.
You can’t winter on that.	Worentumi nkɔ awɔw bere mu wɔ saa asɛm no so.
Keep it warm.	Ma ɛnyɛ hyew.
Thank you, thank you, girl.	Meda wo ase, meda wo ase, abeawa.
We shouldn’t be doing this.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ eyi.
He blinks his eyes.	Ɔbɔ n’ani so.
Just knowing that made me feel empowered.	Ɛno a minim ara kwa no maa metee nka sɛ mewɔ tumi.
Or maybe there was something.	Anaasɛ ebia na biribi wɔ hɔ.
I have no rights.	Minni hokwan biara.
They seem to do that.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ saa.
Is that a dog?	So ɛno yɛ ɔkraman?
However, it’s not my style.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ me su.
Think of a moment.	Susuw bere tiaa bi ho hwɛ.
The new information was not available.	Ná nsɛm foforo no nni hɔ.
We can do something about it.	Yebetumi ayɛ ho biribi.
It might have been interesting to hear more about it.	Ebia na ɛbɛyɛ anigye sɛ metee ho asɛm pii.
And he focused on her completely.	Na ɔde n’adwene sii ne so koraa.
This is obviously not true.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nyɛ nokware.
And not in a good way.	Na ɛnyɛ ɔkwan pa so.
I don't know, I want to know.	Me nnim, mepɛ sɛ mihu.
Not you, obviously.	Ɛnyɛ wo, ɛda adi sɛ.
Do your homework.	Yɛ wo fie nnwuma.
The police have it.	Polisifo no wɔ bi.
I had none of that.	Ná minni saa nneɛma no mu biara.
This is nothing new.	Eyi nyɛ ade foforo.
You might do that.	Ebia wobɛyɛ saa.
And still there though, my pleasure.	Na ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ nanso, me anigye.
You in the next one.	Wo wɔ nea edi hɔ no mu.
But it was outside.	Nanso na ɛwɔ abɔnten.
Give me the details.	Fa nsɛm no mu nsɛm ma me.
Be a real man.	Yɛ ɔbarima ankasa.
Like, really sorry.	Te sɛ, kyɛw ankasa.
You seem to want more.	Ɛte sɛ nea wopɛ pii.
He was doing the only thing he had to do.	Ná ɔreyɛ ade biako pɛ a na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
And in trouble.	Na wɔ ɔhaw mu.
It’s a temporary existence.	Ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi a ɛwɔ hɔ.
The dog could sense danger.	Ná ɔkraman no tumi te asiane nka.
It was a good thing to keep moving forward.	Ná ɛyɛ ade pa sɛ mɛkɔ so akɔ yɛn anim.
Look forward to us.	Hwɛ yɛn kwan.
Or anyone else, for that matter.	Anaasɛ obi foforo biara, ɛno nti.
I use it a lot.	Mede di dwuma pii.
Every human and animal seemed to be paired except me.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onipa ne aboa biara ayɛ baanu baanu gye me nkutoo.
The phone rings all the time.	Telefon no bɔ bere nyinaa.
He seemed happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
It’s so true.	Ɛyɛ nokware saa.
Same idea, really.	Adwene koro no ara, ampa.
The cold lies hard on the ground.	Awɔw no da fam a ɛyɛ den.
You can indeed.	Wubetumi ampa.
Let him do something good for us.	Ma ɔnyɛ biribi pa mma yɛn.
He wasn’t in it.	Ná onni mu.
It was one of those days.	Ná ɛyɛ saa nna no mu biako.
It’s amazing stuff.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Which, as such, is in grave danger.	A sɛnea ɛte no, ɛwɔ asiane kɛse mu.
But there is still a mistake here.	Nanso mfomso bi da so ara wɔ ha.
The accident happened.	Akwanhyia no sii.
We can help you out.	Yebetumi aboa wo.
Except, this time, it wasn’t.	Gye sɛ, saa bere yi de, na ɛnte saa.
Why you don’t know that is pretty odd.	Nea enti a wunnim saa no yɛ nwonwa yiye.
I just joined in to do something.	Mede me ho bɔɔ mu ara kwa sɛ mɛyɛ biribi.
Something happened to him.	Biribi too no.
Many people were shocked.	Nnipa pii ho dwiriw wɔn.
I was not in charge of that.	Ná ɛnyɛ me na mehwɛ saa asɛm no so.
But later on.	Nanso akyiri yi.
I joined last week.	Mede me ho bɔɔ ho dapɛn a etwaam no.
I never want to feel that way again.	Mempɛ sɛ mete nka saa bio da.
It would have been.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
He speaks words too well.	Ɔka nsɛm a wɔka no yiye dodo.
I felt it.	Metee nka.
The last group got me thinking.	Kuw a etwa to no maa misusuwii.
As recently as last week.	Nnansa yi ara sɛnea ɛte wɔ dapɛn a atwam no mu no.
I walked him home.	Mede ne nan kɔɔ fie.
I had to talk to him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa.
And that’s the new thing.	Na ɛno ne ade foforo no.
And you got very good stuff.	Na wo nyaa nneɛma pa paa.
I am busy this morning.	Mewɔ adagyew anɔpa yi.
He wanted everything to stay the same.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ biribiara kɔ so tra hɔ sɛnea ɛte no ara.
And we have them.	Na yɛwɔ wɔn.
I thought you’d like it.	Misusuwii sɛ w’ani begye ho.
I am none of those things.	Menyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara.
His didn’t.	Ne de no anyɛ saa.
For you, it’s quite obvious.	Wɔ wo fam no, ɛda adi koraa.
It wasn’t about sex, he didn’t like that.	Na ɛnyɛ nna ho asɛm, na n’ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
It was very cold there.	Ná awɔw wom kɛse wɔ hɔ.
But some of those things are out of your control.	Nanso saa nneɛma no bi nni wo tumi.
He had made a lot of big money with her.	Ná ɔne no ayɛ sika kɛse pii.
I think that’s why most seniors are so happy.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno nti na wɔn a wɔn mfe akɔ anim dodow no ara ani gye saa no.
He has almost nothing.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ onni hwee.
It seemed to be finally happening.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea awiei koraa no ɛrekɔ so.
We are mostly optimistic.	Yɛwɔ anidaso dodow no ara.
I wanted to give it away.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mede ma.
There is nothing.	Biribiara nni hɔ.
Plan your schedule carefully.	Yɛ wo bere nhyehyɛe ho nhyehyɛe yiye.
It works well and has a solid quality.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye na ɛwɔ su a ɛyɛ den.
I wanted that to be as clear as possible.	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɛno mu da hɔ sɛnea metumi biara.
It still doesn’t.	Ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
Time played with him.	Bere ne no dii agoru.
And there should be no power here.	Na ɛnsɛ sɛ tumi biara wɔ ha.
But he wasn’t there anyway.	Nanso na onni hɔ ɔkwan biara so.
On a paper sheet.	Wɔ krataa so krataa so.
You know, people move on.	Wunim, nkurɔfo kɔ wɔn anim.
He is the one in control.	Ɔno na odi tumi.
He is indeed like that.	Ɔte saa ampa.
And many people, too.	Na nnipa pii nso.
And that went on for a number of years.	Na ɛno kɔɔ so mfe dodow bi.
That can’t be true!	Ɛno ntumi nyɛ nokware!
For now, and if we had to do something about it.	Mprempren de, na sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi a.
Maybe it’s a dog.	Ebia ɛyɛ ɔkraman.
She must be really nice.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
The bed itself is very comfortable and easy to use.	Mpa no ankasa yɛ fɛ yiye na ɛnyɛ den sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
That’s not how it works.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛyɛ adwuma.
Work on that.	Yɛ adwuma wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
You should have seen him.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no.
People seem to sleep a lot these days.	Ɛte sɛ nea nkurɔfo nna pii nnansa yi.
They certainly were.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na wɔyɛ saa.
You need to take action now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho biribi mprempren.
he is involved in it.	ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu.
There are resources available.	Nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma wɔ hɔ.
But we can start doing our part.	Nanso yebetumi afi ase ayɛ yɛn fam de.
The house is very nice.	Ofie no mu yɛ fɛ yiye.
They’re all really good friends.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ nnamfo pa ankasa.
You need to talk to me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne me kasa.
That was a really good room.	Ná ɛno yɛ dan pa ankasa.
It is a very big important and wonderful story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse a ɛho hia na ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
In my opinion at least.	Wɔ m’adwene mu anyɛ yiye koraa no.
You know the people.	Wunim nnipa no.
I’d be more than happy.	M’ani begye ho kɛse.
Two books a year.	Nhoma abien afe biara.
Take action in your school.	Yɛ ho biribi wɔ wo sukuu mu.
That is the end of the story.	Saa na asɛm no bɛba awiei.
The child looked at least a year old.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte sɛ nea abofra no adi afe biako.
He didn’t want his money.	Ná ɔmpɛ ne sika.
We are very interested in what you have to say.	Yɛn ani gye nea wowɔ ka ho yiye.
There was only one.	Ná ɛyɛ biako pɛ.
The same is true of everyone.	Saa ara na obiara te.
He is in great pain.	Ɔyɛ no yaw kɛse.
It’s not about names.	Ɛnyɛ din ahorow ho asɛm.
Take them back.	Fa wɔn san kɔ.
It looked terrible.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
I know he’s in there.	Minim sɛ ɔwɔ mu hɔ.
I hear them.	Mete wɔn.
His wife didn’t keep up.	Ne yere ankɔ so ankɔ so.
He developed the curriculum.	Ɔyɛɛ adesua nhyehyɛe no.
There was someone out there.	Na obi wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
I certainly wasn’t.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na menyɛ saa.
That’s a difficult one.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
We both like her hair quite a bit.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa ani gye ne ti nhwi ho kakra.
Start early a.	Fi ase ntɛm a.
A little night work.	Anadwo adwuma kakra.
This is a fascinating one.	Eyi yɛ anigye.
Just follow along.	Di akyi kɛkɛ.
That was amazing .	Ná ɛno yɛ nwonwa .
This was not his character.	Ná eyi nyɛ ne su.
That’s what it is.	Ɛno ne saa.
There must be something sinister, something sinister.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ biribi a ɛyɛ hu, biribi a ɛyɛ hu wɔ hɔ.
I saw the last few songs.	Mihuu nnwom kakraa bi a etwa to no.
A lot happened today.	Nneɛma pii sii nnɛ.
They were used extensively	Wɔde dii dwuma kɛse
Her hair was wet.	Ná ne ti nhwi ayɛ nsu.
His head nodded slightly.	Ne ti de ne ti too fam kakra.
But too late for that.	Nanso aka akyi dodo ama ɛno.
The new car runs great.	Kar foforo no tu mmirika yiye.
He knows exactly what he is doing.	Onim nea ɔreyɛ no yiye.
In general terms.	Wɔ nsɛm a wɔka no nyinaa mu no.
I thought it was a good idea at the time.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ adwene pa saa bere no.
He seemed so alone.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ ɔno nkutoo saa.
Water is essential for life.	Nsu ho hia ma nkwa.
Maybe I’ll be interested in this.	Ebia m’ani begye eyi ho.
However, she is not the only one of interest.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo ne obi a n’ani gye ne ho.
Thank you for being there for her.	Meda wo ase sɛ wowɔ hɔ ama no.
You can help me here.	Wubetumi aboa me wɔ ha.
He thinks of a happier time.	Osusuw bere a na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse ho.
Nobody really much.	Obiara ankasa pii.
The man came again that night.	Onipa no baa bio saa anadwo no.
Is there any implementation for this.	So biribi wɔ hɔ a wɔde bedi dwuma wɔ eyi ho.
You can let your hair down.	Wubetumi ama wo ti nhwi no akɔ fam.
It’s that simple, it’s so wonderful.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa, ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
We all needed a good night’s sleep.	Ná yɛn nyinaa hia nna pa anadwo.
Not easy at first.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw koraa kan.
Everything was more sophisticated now, more automatic.	Ná biribiara yɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa kɛse mprempren, na ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma ankasa.
So it never worked for me.	Enti anyɛ adwuma amma me da.
And you are here.	Na wowɔ ha.
He didn't want to give her away.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde no bɛma.
My shoes are too tight.	Me mpaboa ayɛ den dodo.
Important longevity.	Nkwa tenten a ɛho hia.
He agreed with me.	Ɔne me yɛɛ adwene.
It’s in his name.	Ɛwɔ ne din mu.
I can definitely see that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ metumi ahu saa.
Here is someone to help you.	Obi a ɔbɛboa wo ni.
It was supposed to be the same.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa ara.
I have pictures with a lot of people.	Mewɔ mfonini ahorow a me ne nnipa pii ayɛ.
Do you get me?.	Wo nsa ka me?.
He has no idea of ​​tomorrow.	Onni ɔkyena ho adwene biara.
You have good friends here.	Wowɔ nnamfo pa wɔ ha.
Keep going and keep going.	Kɔ so kɔ so.
It seems dangerous in my opinion.	Ɛte sɛ nea asiane wom wɔ m’adwene mu.
Follow it and follow it.	Di akyi na di akyi.
It was just a year study, you know.	Na ɛyɛ afe adesua kɛkɛ, wunim.
No one knew how to set it up.	Ná obiara nnim sɛnea wɔde besi hɔ.
I can’t understand it.	Mintumi nte ase.
The power no.	Tumi no.
He was hit by a car.	Kar bi bɔɔ no.
But many people have good qualities.	Nanso nnipa pii wɔ su pa.
I wanted them on mine more than anything.	Ná mepɛ wɔn wɔ me de so sen biribiara.
It’s a little chilly this morning.	Ɛyɛ awɔw kakra anɔpa yi.
But they quickly got out of it.	Nanso wɔde wɔn ho fii mu ntɛmntɛm.
Do what you have to do.	Yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
The end is obvious.	Awiei no da adi.
But it’s worse than that.	Nanso ɛyɛ bɔne sen saa.
It is still true today.	Ɛda so ara yɛ nokware nnɛ.
Maybe that was the problem.	Ebia na ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
There are many different reasons for this.	Nneɛma ahorow pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
I hadn’t thought about the issue.	Ná minsusuw asɛm no ho.
Many of them were brand new at the time.	Ná wɔn mu pii yɛ foforo koraa saa bere no.
There seemed to be no end in sight.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea awiei biara nni hɔ.
It was a plan.	Ná ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe.
He pointed at the man.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ ɔbarima no so.
The work is complex right now.	Adwuma no yɛ nea ɛyɛ den mprempren ara.
He had a price on his head.	Ná ɔwɔ bo bi wɔ ne ti so.
That is no longer true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware bio.
Another one in about me.	Foforo wɔ fa me.
You don’t just have to think about it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wususuw ho kɛkɛ.
Again, there is no joy.	Bio nso, anigye biara nni hɔ.
I expressed myself and myself through food.	Mede aduan kaa m’adwene ne me ho asɛm.
Be careful what you wish for!	Hwɛ yiye wɔ nea wopɛ ho!
He touched her slightly.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne ho kakra.
It was placed in a group home.	Wɔde too kuw bi fie mu.
The police found him.	Polisifo no huu no.
I don’t know him.	Minnim no.
Lunch was late.	Ná awia aduan aka akyi.
That doesn’t matter.	Ɛno deɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
But that was no surprise.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He has been involved in this business for a long time.	Ɔde ne ho ahyɛ saa adwuma yi mu bere tenten.
After everyone has seen it all.	Bere a obiara ahu ne nyinaa akyi.
He will be late.	Ɔbɛka akyi.
I felt cheap.	Ná mete nka sɛ me bo yɛ mmerɛw.
There’s a cat in my bedroom!	Ɔkraman bi wɔ me mpa mu!
It’s part of their job.	Ɛyɛ wɔn adwuma no fã.
He will surprise you every day.	Ɔbɛyɛ wo nwonwa da biara da.
More people used buses than cars.	Nnipa pii de bɔs dii dwuma sen kar.
I hope you all have a great weekend.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo nyinaa anya dapɛn awiei pa.
I wanted to understand.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mete ase.
The story can be told in this way.	Yebetumi aka asɛm no wɔ saa kwan yi so.
Gone, gone.	Akɔ, akɔ.
It’s home for us.	Ɛyɛ fie ma yɛn.
Everyone should come to the table.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara ba pon no ho.
He obviously didn’t know much about children.	Ɛda adi sɛ na onnim mmofra ho nsɛm pii.
Don’t let food go out of sight.	Mma aduan nkɔ abɔnten a ɛnyɛ nea ɛda adi.
Any comments ?.	Nsɛm biara a wopɛ sɛ woka ?.
He knew this would be his test.	Ná onim sɛ eyi bɛyɛ ne sɔhwɛ.
A long time ago.	Bere tenten bi a atwam.
It is usually not dangerous.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ asiane.
He will help you.	Ɔbɛboa wo.
Maybe he'll have to deal with it, eventually.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ odi ho dwuma, awiei koraa no.
My mother used it.	Me maame de dii dwuma.
We are quite busy these days.	Yɛwɔ adagyew koraa nnansa yi.
These kids don’t seem to be happy at all.	Ɛte sɛ nea mmofra yi ani nnye koraa.
It was a first for me.	Ná ɛyɛ nea edi kan ma me.
He had to think and plan.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ osusuw nneɛma ho na ɔyɛ nhyehyɛe.
It seems to me, at least here.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ me, anyɛ yiye koraa no, ha.
He had done it.	Ná wayɛ no.
The children were safe.	Ná mmofra no nni asiane biara.
This had been my home for two years, just mine.	Ná eyi ayɛ me fie mfe abien, me de ara kwa.
Most people have been there.	Nnipa dodow no ara akɔ hɔ.
Part of it, anyway!.	Ne fã bi, sɛnea ɛte biara!.
The new system was flawed.	Ná nhyehyɛe foforo no yɛ nea mfomso wom.
What you’re jealous of.	Nea w’ani bere.
This recipe is easy to make.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ saa aduan yi.
Everything else today will be about him.	Biribiara a aka nnɛ no bɛyɛ ne ho asɛm.
So he slammed his hand on the table.	Enti ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ pon no so denneennen.
And you’ve done it right.	Na woayɛ no yiye.
I told him that something was wrong.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye wɔ ho.
Add the water.	Fa nsu no ka ho.
He is a master of what he does.	Ɔyɛ obi a onim nea ɔyɛ no yiye.
Children are the most popular.	Mmofra na wɔn ani gye ho kɛse.
Someone or something that.	Obi anaa ade bi a.
There are few jobs available now.	Nnwuma kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ mprempren.
I want to work on it.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ho adwuma.
These types of things should always remain the same.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma ahorow yi kɔ so tra hɔ sɛnea ɛte no ara bere nyinaa.
The two are not one and the same.	Nnipa baanu no nyɛ biako na ɛyɛ pɛ.
The city does many things.	Kurow no yɛ nneɛma pii.
And there are indeed many more.	Na pii nso wɔ hɔ ampa.
It’s the same for everyone.	Ɛyɛ ade koro ma obiara.
Look here!	Hwɛ ha!
Whether you can do it.	Sɛ́ ebia wubetumi ayɛ.
This is a terrible story!	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ hu!
I look at my mother.	Mehwɛ me maame.
But again, it didn’t matter.	Nanso bio, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
That wasn’t the point.	Ná ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
It was a man.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔbarima.
He already feels terrible.	Ɔte nka sɛ ne ho yɛ hu dedaw.
The experiment was successful.	Sɔhwɛ no yɛɛ yiye.
This incident happened at night.	Saa asɛm yi sii anadwo.
Not even here at the end of everything.	Ɛnyɛ ha mpo wɔ biribiara awiei.
He even told me he liked the new me.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me mpo sɛ n’ani gye me foforo no ho.
It’s not you and you.	Ɛnyɛ wo ne wo.
I planned the whole thing.	Meyɛɛ ade no nyinaa ho nhyehyɛe.
I can't understand how this is supposed to work.	Mintumi nte sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma no ase.
In a way you.	Ɔkwan bi so no wo.
Another drop fell.	Nsu foforo bi nso hwee ase.
You can see it from here.	Wubetumi afi ha ahu.
But we will do that.	Nanso yɛbɛyɛ saa.
Your problem must be something else.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo haw no yɛ biribi foforo.
That’s the reason for it.	Ɛno ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
He was not a happy man.	Ná ɔnyɛ onipa a ɔwɔ anigye.
Go to class every day.	Kɔ adesua da biara da.
My father was such a strong man.	Ná me papa yɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ den saa.
It’s true, in a way.	Ɛyɛ nokware, ɔkwan bi so.
He was involved in it.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnte saa.
But it’s beautiful.	Nanso ɛyɛ fɛ.
There were many more times when he did something similar.	Mpɛn pii bio wɔ hɔ a ɔyɛɛ biribi a ɛte saa ara.
Study is the only thing you need to do.	Adesua nkutoo ne ade a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
You can park our car on the street.	Wubetumi de yɛn kar no asi abɔnten so.
However, I had to do that.	Nanso, na ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
He’s a wonderful guy.	Ɔyɛ nwonwa.
I think that was me.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno ne me.
We were only good in word.	Na yɛyɛ papa wɔ asɛm nkutoo mu.
That’s what he has to do.	Ɛno ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
The music is absolutely terrible.	Nnwom no yɛ hu koraa.
You know how you can.	Wunim sɛnea wubetumi.
And it was still there.	Na na ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
A car was nearby at the time of the accident.	Ná kar bi bɛn hɔ bere a akwanhyia no sii no.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
And he does that.	Na ɔyɛ saa.
This can be very difficult.	Eyi betumi ayɛ den yiye.
But before you do, make your reasons clear.	Nanso ansa na wobɛyɛ saa no, ma nea enti a woyɛ saa no mu nna hɔ.
Not in any way.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan biara so.
Or at least that’s how it felt to me.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na na ɛte wɔ me fam.
I’m not even happier than you.	M’ani nnye mpo sen wo.
Maybe that’s why it’s so.	Ebia ɛno nti na ɛte saa.
I can decide for myself here.	Metumi asi gyinae ama me ho wɔ ha.
I’m so excited about your new hairstyle.	M’ani agye wo ti nhwi foforo no ho kɛse.
No one wanted to play.	Ná obiara mpɛ sɛ odi agoru.
There is no need for input.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔde nsɛm hyɛ mu.
He can go further.	Obetumi akɔ akyiri.
But other than that, they are fantastic.	Nanso sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, wɔyɛ nwonwa.
At his side.	Wɔ ne nkyɛn.
There was nothing to do.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
My car runs feels smoother now.	Me kar no tu mmirika no te nka sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw mprempren.
How does one keep warm?	Ɔkwan bɛn so na obi ma ne ho yɛ hyew?
This solves a big problem.	Eyi di ɔhaw kɛse bi ho dwuma.
It wasn’t too late.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea aka akyi dodo.
He is our only child.	Ɔno nkutoo ne yɛn ba.
I love the look of this house.	M’ani gye sɛnea ofie yi tebea te no ho.
Don’t go to them.	Mma nkɔ wɔn nkyɛn.
If the jobs need it.	Sɛ nnwuma no hia.
In this case the number of songs is two.	Wɔ eyi mu no nnwom dodow no yɛ abien.
The work began early.	Adwuma no fii ase ntɛm.
You were so beautiful.	Ná wo ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
There was so much to do.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He knows exactly what to do.	Onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no yiye.
It’s too easy for them.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo ma wɔn.
Is there any truth in that?	Nokware bi wɔ saa asɛm no mu?
That doesn’t matter.	Ɛno nyɛ hwee.
His friends speak well of him.	Ne nnamfo ka ne ho asɛm yiye.
I will focus on one.	Mede m’adwene besi biako so.
After that everything works.	Ɛno akyi no biribiara yɛ adwuma.
You almost have to plan for that.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nhyehyɛe ma ɛno.
We are human beings.	Yɛyɛ nnipa.
Which I just couldn’t control.	Nea na mintumi nni wɔn so kɛkɛ.
I think the point should be clear.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ asɛm no mu da hɔ.
But that’s okay, he told himself.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ hwee, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho.
There is no time to think about it.	Bere biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
His talk covered important issues.	Ne kasa no kaa nsɛm a ɛho hia ho asɛm.
His legs are much stronger than my hands.	Ne nan mu yɛ den koraa sen me nsa.
But it doesn’t work here.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
It was very challenging and really testing.	Ná ɛyɛ den yiye na na ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ ankasa.
And good food too.	Na aduan pa nso.
You can easily do this at home.	Wubetumi ayɛ eyi wɔ fie a ɛnyɛ den.
However, it was too late now.	Nanso, na aka akyi dodo mprempren.
She wants to be treated like a man.	Ɔpɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no sɛ ɔbarima.
Our team is trying to provide you with interesting information.	Yɛn kuw no rebɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔde nsɛm a ɛyɛ anigye bɛma wo.
It has real people in the story.	Ɛwɔ nnipa ankasa wɔ asɛm no mu.
Everyone should know that it is not true.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nnipa nyinaa hu sɛ ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa.
He didn’t have many friends.	Ná onni nnamfo pii.
He was there early.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ ntɛm.
This project is currently in progress.	Saa adwuma yi rekɔ so mprempren.
Not even for fear of your lives.	Ɛnyɛ mo nkwa ho suro mpo nti.
It is not a bright prospect.	Ɛnyɛ anidaso a ɛyɛ anigye.
Anyone who feels they can control it.	Obiara a ɔte nka sɛ obetumi adi so.
Or bad for you.	Anaasɛ bɔne mma wo.
He didn't know if he could do it.	Ná onnim sɛ ebia obetumi ayɛ anaa.
None of them did anything.	Wɔn mu biara anyɛ ade biara.
I've done it again.	Mayɛ no bio.
How wonderful it is.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
It seemed to resemble a person.	Ɛte sɛ nea na ɛte sɛ onipa bi.
But we do this.	Nanso yɛyɛ eyi.
He works for me.	Ɔyɛ adwuma ma me.
There was something sinister in the room with him.	Ná biribi bɔne bi wɔ dan no mu ne no.
Be careful, though.	Nanso, hwɛ yiye.
He planned his schedule carefully.	Ɔyɛɛ ne nhyehyɛe ho nhyehyɛe yiye.
At least in this first game.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ agoru a edi kan yi mu.
Only he himself is the same.	Ɔno ankasa nkutoo na ɔyɛ ade koro.
However, it doesn’t work for me.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ adwuma mma me.
He did everything.	Ɔyɛɛ biribiara.
There was no reason for it.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I tell you it was too true.	Meka kyerɛ wo sɛ na ɛyɛ nokware dodo.
And he was involved in a	Na ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ obi a .
That was a good time.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere pa.
Everyone else, get down.	Obiara a aka no, kɔ fam.
Play it daily in the evening or morning time.	Bɔ no da biara da anwummere anaa anɔpa bere.
Things didn’t quite go that way.	Nneɛma ankɔ so koraa saa kwan no so.
With him, in a way, it wasn’t.	Ne no, ɔkwan bi so no, na ɛnte saa.
It was always sex.	Na ɛyɛ nna bere nyinaa.
The issue was the same.	Ná asɛm no yɛ ade koro.
If it’s a mistake.	Sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
You have to do it this way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no saa kwan yi so.
He was troubled by the unfamiliar face.	Ná anim a onnim no haw no.
Something definitely went wrong.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye.
He could have been there for a while.	Anka obetumi akɔ hɔ kakra.
I saw him live in front of everyone you know.	Mihuu no sɛ ɔte ase wɔ obiara a wunim no anim.
, which is in a state .	, a ɛwɔ tebea bi mu .
He doesn’t work anymore.	Ɔnyɛ adwuma bio.
I do feel for you.	Meyɛ saa a, mete nka ma wo.
I love using it in different projects.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mede bedi dwuma wɔ nnwuma ahorow mu.
It seems that it will in any case.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ saa wɔ tebea biara mu.
I can’t do things.	Mintumi nyɛ nneɛma.
We can make it worse for you.	Yebetumi ama ayɛ bɔne ama wo.
Three years of service.	Mfe abiɛsa a wɔde ayɛ adwuma.
Do something new for at least a year.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yɛ biribi foforo afe biako.
Most hands went down.	Nsa dodow no ara kɔɔ fam.
I hear you talking.	Mete wo asɛm.
I have to be honest with you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka nokware kyerɛ wo.
I want you to stay here with me.	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me tra ha.
You can break them.	Wubetumi abu wɔn so.
Not as a girl.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ abeawa.
He loved the cold.	Ná n’ani gye awɔw no ho.
Sen in it.	Sen wɔ mu.
You can see it on their faces.	Wubetumi ahu wɔ wɔn anim.
I don’t have anything I want.	Minni biribi a mepɛ.
In my opinion, it was.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no, na ɛte saa.
There is not much you can do about it.	Nneɛma pii nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
He didn’t seem to have any.	Ɛte sɛ nea na onni bi.
There is nothing else you need to do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ bio.
That’s the home team.	Ɛno ne ofie kuw no.
You have crazy hair.	Wowɔ ti nhwi a ɛyɛ kraman.
Spend some time with animals.	Fa bere bi ne mmoa di dwuma.
One is brand new.	Biako yɛ foforo koraa.
But even here.	Nanso ha mpo.
It’s hard to tell.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka.
The words were simple.	Ná nsɛm no yɛ mmerɛw.
But he could certainly take care of himself.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na obetumi ahwɛ ne ho.
Sex is very important.	Nna ho hia paa.
It was an amazing performance.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I'm not doing anything right now.	Menyɛ hwee mprempren.
If you’re not happy, say so.	Sɛ w’ani nnye a, ka saa.
I don’t want to get into it, though.	Mempɛ sɛ mekɔ mu, nanso.
Besides, first.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, edi kan.
Not that anything you people do you much good.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ biribiara a mo nkurɔfo no yɛ mo yiye pii.
Thrive!.	Kɔ so!.
It didn’t do him any good.	Anyɛ no yiye biara.
This may be a wise course for us as well.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ ɔkwan a nyansa wom ama yɛn nso.
We like those things.	Yɛn ani gye saa nneɛma no ho.
Keep up the good work.	Kɔ so yɛ adwuma pa no.
Make plans now.	Yɛ ho nhyehyɛe mprempren.
I admire him a lot as a filmmaker.	M’ani gye ne ho kɛse sɛ obi a ɔyɛ sini.
The pictures are beautiful.	Mfonini ahorow no yɛ fɛ.
I guess that’s whatever it is.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne nea ɛte biara.
He just wants you to be happy.	Nea ɔpɛ ara ne sɛ w’ani gye.
But this is your day.	Nanso eyi ne wo da.
Almost nothing seemed to work.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biribiara ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
I hand over mine and head to lunch.	Mede me de no ma na mede m’ani kyerɛ awia aduan.
You can never know.	Worentumi nhu da.
And this new thing.	Na ade foforo yi nso.
They have nothing to do with me.	Wɔn ne me nni hwee yɛ.
Someone has to do things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ nneɛma.
No one likes the person who is good at everything.	Obiara mpɛ onipa a ne ho akokwaw wɔ biribiara mu no.
The money should still be there.	Ɛsɛ sɛ sika no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
There must be a.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
His hand fell to her.	Ne nsa hwee ase kɔɔ ne nkyɛn.
Have fun out there.	Gye w’ani wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
Naturally, he seemed to do everything right.	Sɛnea ɛte no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ biribiara yiye.
He doesn’t do anything.	Ɔnyɛ hwee.
However, this should not be the case.	Nanso, ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ saa.
They like it tough.	Wɔn ani gye ho sɛ ɛyɛ den.
Whatever it is, it will be fine.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ biara no, ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
He must have something interesting.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔwɔ biribi a ɛyɛ anigye.
Which is not a good thing.	Nea ɛnyɛ ade pa.
His last book.	Ne nhoma a etwa to no.
Too many don’t.	Pii dodo no nyɛ saa.
No one was really talking about it.	Ná obiara nka ho asɛm ankasa.
Besides.	To nkyɛn.
There are many cars on the road.	Kar pii wɔ kwan no so.
There was no phone in his room.	Ná telefon biara nni ne dan mu.
He had to tell her.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ no.
It looks pretty good.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye yiye.
He is very good for his age.	Ɔyɛ papa paa ma ne mfe.
However, you need to do it immediately.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no ntɛm ara.
I know my father was there.	Minim sɛ na me papa wɔ hɔ.
Then he felt better.	Ɛno akyi no, ne ho tɔɔ no.
I didn’t know what was going on.	Ná minnim nea ɛrekɔ so.
It’s a problem.	Ɛyɛ ɔhaw.
The kids will love it.	Mmofra no ani begye ho.
But he has done so.	Nanso wayɛ saa.
And, in the end, it was great for him.	Na, awiei koraa no, na ɛyɛ kɛse maa no.
Definitely check them out.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ hwɛ wɔn.
And there is one other thing.	Na ade foforo biako nso wɔ hɔ.
I love where we are.	M’ani gye baabi a yɛwɔ ho.
I thought he was very lucky.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔwɔ anigye kɛse.
You were a child then.	Saa bere no na woyɛ abofra.
And it has been used well.	Na wɔde adi dwuma yiye.
And if anything, the task was a little easier.	Na sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, na adwuma no yɛ mmerɛw kakra.
For one thing, there are still many good things happening.	Ade biako ne sɛ nneɛma pa pii da so ara rekɔ so.
The picture seems to be moving.	Ɛte sɛ nea mfonini no rekɔ so.
This can be done for anyone.	Eyi betumi ayɛ yiye ama obiara.
Never tell anyone you have hot water.	Nka nkyerɛ obiara da sɛ wowɔ nsu a ɛyɛ hyew.
But it was actually more like this.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ eyi kɛse ankasa.
Language has tremendous power.	Kasa wɔ tumi kɛse.
There were two of them.	Ná ɛyɛ abien.
But he was already too strange.	Nanso na ɔyɛ nwonwa dodo dedaw.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnte saa.
For them, it’s just work.	Wɔ wɔn fam no, ɛyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
On the schedule.	Wɔ nhyehyɛe no so.
He always does that.	Ɔyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
This period is usually very short.	Mpɛn pii no, saa bere yi yɛ tiaa koraa.
The more everyone does everything, the less they know about it.	Dodow a obiara yɛ biribiara no, dodow no ara na onnim ho hwee.
I just don’t understand.	Me nte ase kɛkɛ.
I didn’t want to miss it anymore.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mepa ho kyɛw bio.
There are no good people.	Nnipa pa biara nni hɔ.
Too much was at stake.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ asiane mu dodo.
Maybe I was just rare in his.	Ebia na me ho yɛ na ara kwa wɔ ne de no mu.
They were really good at it.	Ná wɔn ho akokwaw wɔ mu ankasa.
If anything, my hearing makes it harder.	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, sɛnea mete no ma ɛyɛ den kɛse.
It was under the bed.	Ná ɛwɔ mpa no ase.
But they shouldn’t be.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I think that’s true for most people.	Misusuw sɛ ɛte saa wɔ nnipa dodow no ara fam.
He is a charming character.	Ɔyɛ obi a n’ani gye.
But not the dog.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɔkraman no.
He is about my age.	Ɔyɛ bɛyɛ me mfe.
It should be a little bigger.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse kakra.
One, the story itself.	Biako, asɛm no ankasa.
Don’t take my words.	Mfa me nsɛm nka.
I am not used to driving in the city.	Ɛnyɛ me su sɛ mɛka kar wɔ kurow no mu.
Something has to come first, something last.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi di kan, biribi a etwa to.
He is not a good man.	Ɔnyɛ onipa pa.
Take care of it now.	Hwɛ so yiye mprempren.
I doubt anyone would.	Migye kyim sɛ obi bɛyɛ saa.
I know a lot of people.	Minim nnipa pii.
See if anything comes out of that.	Hwɛ sɛ biribi fi saa mu ba anaa.
It’s dangerous.	Ɛyɛ nea asiane wom.
We just had a thing.	Ná yɛwɔ ade bi kɛkɛ.
The same is true of a book.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nhoma bi ho.
But that didn’t work out.	Nanso ɛno ankɔ yiye.
It wasn’t like he didn’t know himself.	Na ɛnte sɛ nea ɔno ankasa nnim.
Like a human being.	Te sɛ onipa.
Which is very impressive.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
My mother was not well.	Me maame ho anyɛ yiye koraa.
Be strong but flexible.	Yɛ obi a ɔyɛ den nanso ɔyɛ mmerɛw.
Don’t feed the animals!	Mma mmoa no aduan!
It works really well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ankasa.
It has been a great test.	Ayɛ sɔhwɛ kɛse.
No one seems to come this way.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara mfa saa kwan yi so mma.
This looks absolutely amazing.	Eyi hwɛ yɛ nwonwa koraa.
There was only one.	Ná ɛyɛ biako pɛ.
It was just beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa.
Take another one, too.	Fa foforo nso.
You are not perfect, no one is.	Wonyɛ pɛ, obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ pɛ.
Mornings are an exciting time of day.	Anɔpa yɛ bere a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ da no mu.
The rear end makes up for it.	Akyi awiei no ma ɛyɛ yiye.
But there would be no joy.	Nanso anka anigye biara nni hɔ.
Even the animals seem to feel it.	Ɛte sɛ nea mmoa no mpo te nka.
Many children are poor.	Mmofra pii di hia.
In every outfit.	Wɔ atade biara mu.
But he knew anyway.	Nanso na onim ɔkwan biara so.
That’s girl stuff.	Ɛno ne abeawa nneɛma.
We can work together.	Yebetumi ayɛ adwuma.
The construction period should be three years.	Ɛsɛ sɛ bere a wɔde besi dan no yɛ mfe abiɛsa.
He tells her.	Ɔka kyerɛ no.
He knew what he wanted.	Ná onim nea ɔpɛ.
It was indeed a happy time.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye bere ampa.
I can eat anything.	Metumi adi biribiara.
Do you think he is innocent?	Wususuw sɛ ne ho nni asɛm?
One man said.	Ɔbarima biako kae sɛ.
He wishes you well anyway.	Ɔpɛ wo yiye sɛnea ɛte biara.
I disagree with what they do.	Me ne nea wɔyɛ no nyɛ adwene.
Here’s what you need to do for a child.	Hwɛ ade a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ma abofra.
Is this what you believe?	So eyi ne nea wugye di?
This book was awesome.	Ná nhoma yi yɛ hu.
I believe he is innocent.	Migye di sɛ ne ho nni asɛm.
It has made some things better.	Ama nneɛma bi ayɛ yiye.
The thing is, he had no idea if he could.	Asɛm no ne sɛ, na onni adwene biara sɛ obetumi anaa.
I can’t see anyone here.	Mintumi nhu obiara wɔ ha.
He does the same thing.	Ɔno nso yɛ saa ara.
I really liked that.	M’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho yiye.
On the floor, boy! 	Wɔ fam, abarimaa!
he said to himself.	ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho.
Lots of power, this.	Tumi pii, eyi.
I want that right now.	Mepɛ saa mprempren ara.
That kid was amazing.	Ná saa abofra no yɛ nwonwa.
Time was running out.	Ná bere reyɛ den.
I can't see properly.	Mintumi nhu ade sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I don’t think it is.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛnte saa.
This is not really a problem.	Eyi nyɛ ɔhaw ankasa.
It just doesn’t work out.	Ɛnyɛ yiye ara kwa.
Anyway, you are absolutely right!	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, woayɛ no yiye koraa!
It’s inside him.	Ɛyɛ ne mu.
He was a very strong man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ den yiye.
I couldn’t believe my eyes.	Ná mintumi nnye m’ani nni.
He obviously had a lot to say.	Ná ɛda adi sɛ ɔwɔ pii ka.
This dress is too tight.	Saa atade yi yɛ den dodo.
My pain saved my life.	Me yaw no gyee me nkwa.
So does everyone else.	Saa ara na obiara a aka no nso te.
Include some of those things.	Fa saa nneɛma no bi ka ho.
We will do that for you.	Yɛbɛyɛ saa ama wo.
But here they are amazing.	Nanso ha no, wɔyɛ nwonwa.
Yes, there is.	Ampa, ɛwɔ hɔ.
I really enjoyed it.	M’ani gyee ho ankasa.
I definitely have to.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
I’d love to work outside.	M’ani begye ho sɛ mɛyɛ adwuma wɔ abɔnten.
Like, it’s really hard.	Te sɛ, ɛyɛ den ankasa.
Consider! 	Hwɛ!
How do we make good food?	Yɛyɛ dɛn yɛ aduan pa?
I have one right here.	Mewɔ bi wɔ ha yi ara.
We get deeply involved in the story, the characters or the idea.	Yɛde yɛn ho hyɛ asɛm no, nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm anaa adwene no mu kɛse.
I don’t like it anymore.	M’ani nnye ho bio.
It certainly was in our case.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛte wɔ yɛn fam.
If not, it will be.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I was very happy with the price.	M’ani gyee bo no ho yiye.
That was all a long time ago.	Ɛno nyinaa yɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
Do as much first work as you can.	Yɛ adwuma a edi kan biara sɛnea wubetumi.
I have so much more to offer.	Mewɔ pii bio a ɛsɛ sɛ mede ma.
The status quo is unsustainable.	Tebea a ɛwɔ hɔ no ntumi nkɔ so.
The work was difficult.	Ná adwuma no yɛ den.
Most things people want, but don’t need.	Nneɛma dodow no ara a nkurɔfo pɛ, nanso enhia.
So if you want to, go ahead.	Enti sɛ wopɛ a, kɔ so.
I give him my hand.	Mede me nsa ma no.
Right now.	Seesei ara.
He knows exactly why.	Onim nea enti a ɛte saa no yiye.
No one came forward.	Obiara amma anim.
His is just beautiful.	Ne de no yɛ fɛ ara kwa.
The time had come for him.	Na bere no adu ne so.
Don’t tell anyone what’s really going on.	Nka nea ɛrekɔ so ankasa nkyerɛ obiara.
A little bit of it.	Kakraa bi.
Her legs felt numb.	Ne nan tee nka sɛ ayɛ mmerɛw.
It will be cold here tonight.	Awɔw bɛba ha anadwo yi.
It becomes part of everything you do.	Ɛbɛyɛ biribiara a woyɛ no fã.
They had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Nothing was missing.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛho nhia.
Entire .	Ne nyinaa .
Go do it.	Kɔ yɛ.
It was a really nice opportunity for us.	Ná ɛyɛ hokwan a ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa ma yɛn.
Everyone is so much fun to work with.	Obiara yɛ anigye kɛse sɛ wo ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
That’s how it worked on the field.	Saa na na ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ abɔnten so.
Which was good.	Nea na eye.
Fewer people and fewer animals.	Nnipa kakraa bi ne mmoa kakraa bi.
And the animals, too.	Na mmoa no nso.
He is very involved in the story.	Ɔde ne ho ahyɛ asɛm no mu yiye.
I don’t think they liked it very much.	Minsusuw sɛ wɔn ani gyee ho kɛse.
This is expensive.	Eyi yɛ nea ɛho ka yɛ den.
He knows better than anyone what happened.	Onim nea esii no yiye sen obiara.
The picture is amazing.	Mfonini no yɛ nwonwa.
I just thought you might like that too.	Misusuwii kɛkɛ sɛ ebia w’ani begye saa nso ho.
We headed down the road.	Yɛde yɛn ani kyerɛɛ ɔkwan no so.
It’s how things work.	Ɛyɛ sɛnea nneɛma yɛ adwuma.
You and your books.	Wo ne wo nhoma ahorow.
I loved it and I wanted to do it.	M’ani gyee ho na na mepɛ sɛ meyɛ.
I think it is .	Misusuw sɛ ɛte saa .
He pointed to the phone.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ telefon no so.
The plan includes many important features.	Nneɛma pii a ɛho hia ka nhyehyɛe no ho.
A man came into view.	Ɔbarima bi baa wɔn ani so.
I wanted it bad.	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne.
It all came to nothing anyway.	Ne nyinaa baa hwee ɔkwan biara so.
Many things went wrong.	Nneɛma pii ankɔ yiye.
However, he could do so.	Nanso, na obetumi ayɛ saa.
He thinks it’s a mistake.	Osusuw sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
Maybe he was too young for that.	Ebia na wayɛ abofra dodo ama saa.
But live and he did.	Nanso tra ase na ɔyɛɛ saa.
You might have saved all of us.	Ebia na wugye yɛn nkwa nyinaa.
Obviously not.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnte saa.
Everyone knew about it.	Ná obiara nim ho asɛm.
Help for today.	Mmoa ma nnɛ.
He has a quick mind.	Ɔwɔ adwene a ɛyɛ ntɛm.
You no longer have to worry about what you are aiming for.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ nea wode w’ani asi so no haw wo bio.
No help from anyone.	Mmoa biara mfi obiara hɔ.
None of them were willing to help.	Ná wɔn mu biara nni ɔpɛ sɛ ɔbɛboa.
But not here, and not now.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ha, na ɛnyɛ mprempren nso.
All the animals love to eat.	Mmoa no nyinaa ani gye aduan ho.
And that has happened in the past.	Na ɛno nso asi wɔ bere a atwam no mu.
The same was true of his son.	Saa ara na na ɛte wɔ ne ba no fam.
It’s all about them.	Ne nyinaa fa wɔn ho.
And it was a lot of fun.	Na na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
That is quite possible.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye koraa.
There were other factors.	Ná nneɛma foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
Here is a similar story.	Asɛm a ɛte saa ara ni.
He didn't know what to do or where to go.	Ná onnim nea ɔnyɛ anaa baabi a ɔbɛkɔ.
The animal approaches him.	Aboa no bɛn no.
Go for long walks.	Kɔ nantew tenten.
I might go outside.	Ebia mɛkɔ abɔnten.
This can happen quite quickly.	Eyi betumi aba ntɛmntɛm koraa.
He was imprisoned.	Wɔde no too afiase.
The last addition was a little painful.	Nea etwa to a wɔde kaa ho no yɛɛ yaw kakra.
Meetings are one reason.	Nhyiam yɛ ade biako nti a ɛte saa.
The first letter.	Krataa a edi kan no.
I could get hot.	Ná metumi ayɛ hyew.
There was no shortage of food.	Ná aduan nni hɔ a ɛho nhia.
It’s a great opportunity.	Ɛyɛ hokwan kɛse.
And it really was.	Na ɛte saa ankasa.
He is the one she has to live with.	Ɔno na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne no tra ase.
I really like him.	M’ani gye ne ho ankasa.
An interesting thought touched him.	Adwene bi a ɛyɛ anigye kaa ne ho.
That was what you were aiming for.	Ná ɛno ne nea wode w’ani asi so no.
Maybe it’s a good thing.	Ebia ɛyɛ ade pa.
There is a little work.	Adwuma kakra wɔ hɔ.
There were too many people.	Ná nnipa pii wɔ hɔ dodo.
It was so hard to concentrate!	Ná ɛyɛ den yiye sɛ mede m’adwene besi biribi so!
It was true and it wasn’t.	Na ɛyɛ nokware na na ɛnyɛ nokware.
That means you can charge more.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ wubetumi agye sika pii.
I cannot thank people enough for this.	Mintumi nna nkurɔfo ase sɛnea ɛsɛ wɔ eyi ho.
Keep talking as you work.	Kɔ so kasa bere a woreyɛ adwuma no.
And take the old one down.	Na fa dedaw no kɔ fam.
This is a situation that requires immediate action.	Eyi yɛ tebea a ɛho hia sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi ntɛm ara.
It hurts him.	Ɛyɛ no yaw.
But he wasn’t there.	Nanso na onni hɔ.
I told him that the food was good, so that he would be happy.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ aduan no yɛ fɛ, sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a n’ani begye.
I don’t care about that.	Ɛno ho mfa me ho.
Good to this day.	Eye de besi nnɛ.
People were impressed with him.	Nkurɔfo ani gyee ne ho.
There are things going down.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛrekɔ fam.
So he drove to the driveway.	Enti ɔde ne kar no kɔɔ baabi a wɔde kar kɔ no.
Almost a lot.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ pii.
But it would be nice to be clear about this.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛka eyi ho asɛm yiye.
What is the nature of the problem?	Ɔhaw no te dɛn?
They are very good.	Wɔyɛ papa paa.
He had the power.	Ná ɔwɔ tumi no.
She was nice, but not my type.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ, nanso na ɔnyɛ me su.
But he didn't want to be free.	Nanso na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho.
But not at that time.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa bere no.
You were both there, you both knew.	Na mo baanu nyinaa wɔ hɔ, na mo baanu nyinaa nim.
It’s like money.	Ɛte sɛ sika.
I did it right.	Meyɛɛ no ​​yiye.
Look at that girl there!	Hwɛ saa abeawa no wɔ hɔ!
As it might be.	Sɛnea ebia ɛbɛyɛ no.
And this isn’t much.	Na eyi nyɛ pii.
Not my baby, but that’s the next best thing.	Ɛnyɛ me ba no, nanso ɛno ne ade a edi hɔ a eye sen biara.
However, you should not say it too loudly.	Nanso, ɛnsɛ sɛ woka no den kɛse.
I can’t seem to do this.	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nyɛ eyi.
This was going too far.	Ná eyi rekɔ akyiri dodo.
Something better, he knew, was out there for him.	Biribi a eye sen saa, na onim, wɔ abɔnten hɔ ma no.
In order to be able to do so.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wubetumi ayɛ saa.
So that’s true.	Enti ɛno yɛ nokware.
However, this doesn’t work.	Nanso, eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
That to me is a bad idea.	Ɛno ma me no yɛ adwene bɔne.
Hope it’s true.	Anidaso sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
This is a long time first.	Eyi yɛ bere tenten a edi kan.
They walk with their hands.	Wɔde wɔn nsa nantew.
They are usually not the same size.	Mpɛn pii no, wɔn kɛse nyɛ pɛ.
Water is essential for life.	Nsu ho hia ma nkwa.
If anyone can do it, he can.	Sɛ obi betumi ayɛ a, obetumi.
This always seems to come back true.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi san ba nokware bere nyinaa.
Not after the last time he did.	Ɛnyɛ bere a etwa to a ɔyɛɛ saa no akyi.
Everyone needs to hear this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara te eyi.
That had been a reality.	Ná ɛno ayɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Everyone can still say whatever they want.	Obiara da so ara tumi ka nea ɔpɛ biara.
This is not a game.	Eyi nyɛ agoru bi.
We brought them inside.	Yɛde wɔn baa mu.
He knew a lot of things.	Ná onim nneɛma pii.
Which he certainly was .	Nea akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔyɛ .
I wonder if we do anything similar.	Misusuw sɛ ebia yɛyɛ biribi a ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ anaa.
His father had been asleep for three days.	Ná ne papa nna nnansa ni.
But you can’t take that for granted.	Nanso worentumi mfa saa asɛm no.
You know it, too.	Wo nso wunim.
A few years late, but still awesome.	Mfe kakraa bi na aka akyi, nanso ɛda so ara yɛ hu.
It was all part of the same plan.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ nhyehyɛe koro no ara fã.
I would give my life for him.	Ná mede me nkwa bɛma ama no.
That is a serious mistake.	Ɛno yɛ mfomso kɛse.
This was not good.	Ná eyi nyɛ papa.
The head may be given to his wife.	Ebia wɔde ti no bɛma ne yere.
Trust in him, and he will help you.	Fa wo ho to no so, na ɔbɛboa wo.
They will all be here.	Wɔn nyinaa bɛba ha.
We should have done the same.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa ara.
If the man saw her, it was uncertain.	Sɛ ɔbarima no huu no a, na ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
I would say, an animal.	Anka mɛka sɛ, aboa bi.
I just take it.	Me fa no ara kwa.
What a day for both of them.	Hwɛ da a ɛyɛ ma wɔn baanu nyinaa.
He thought it was a good thing.	Ná osusuw sɛ ɛyɛ ade pa.
I can tell him.	Metumi aka no.
It works well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
A quality move.	Ade a ɛyɛ papa a wɔde tu.
The work would take hours.	Ná adwuma no begye nnɔnhwerew pii.
Thank you anyway.	Meda wo ase ɔkwan biara so.
It’s easy to tell.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛka.
It’s hard for me to do that.	Ɛyɛ den ma me sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
That may indeed be something I can handle.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ nea metumi adi ho dwuma ampa.
He had no idea what to tell her.	Ná onni nea ɔbɛka akyerɛ no ho adwene biara.
It was the same in her room before.	Saa ara na na ɛte wɔ ne dan mu kan no.
He did a very good job.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma pa ara.
None of us is without a party mood.	Yɛn mu biara nni hɔ a onni apontow ho adwene.
He did this this morning.	Ɔyɛɛ saa anɔpa yi.
We will work on it.	Yɛbɛyɛ ho adwuma.
What a wonderful day!	Da a ɛyɛ anigye bɛn ara ni!
He is very unpleasant.	Ɔyɛ obi a n’ani nnye ho yiye.
Everyone loved to be around him.	Ná obiara ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛka ne ho.
Anything was possible, but not in a good way.	Ná biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye, nanso na ɛnyɛ ɔkwan pa so.
No two production systems are the same.	Nhyehyɛe abien biara nni hɔ a wɔde yɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ pɛ.
Maybe you can make her a man.	Ebia wubetumi de ne ayɛ ɔbarima.
He didn't want to talk about anything else anymore.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka biribi foforo ho asɛm bio.
Where there is a will, there is a way.	Baabi a ɔpɛ wɔ hɔ no, ɔkwan bi wɔ hɔ.
This was very disturbing to him.	Na eyi haw no kɛse.
This book tells a different story.	Saa nhoma yi ka asɛm foforo.
The absolute necessity doesn’t make it any less important.	Nea ɛho hia koraa no mma ɛho nhia kɛse.
No one knew him.	Obiara nni hɔ a na onim no.
But things didn’t go well there.	Nanso nneɛma ankɔ yiye wɔ hɔ.
He was sentenced to life imprisonment.	Wɔde no too afiase ne nkwa nna nyinaa.
It’s pretty incredible there.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
You don’t have to talk about me.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woka me ho asɛm.
Can anyone tell me what this means?	So obi betumi aka nea eyi kyerɛ akyerɛ me?
Among them were those who were simply wonderful.	Wɔn a na wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa ara kwa nso ka wɔn ho.
I want to hear from you.	Mepɛ sɛ mete fi mo hɔ.
Mom had said it herself.	Ná Maame ankasa aka.
I really like most everything.	M’ani gye biribiara dodow no ara ho ankasa.
It’s not surprising.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He knew the story was true.	Ná onim sɛ asɛm no yɛ nokware.
So you don’t have to doubt at all.	Enti enhia sɛ wugye akyinnye koraa.
I understand the whole situation.	Mete tebea no nyinaa ase.
Be careful what you wish for.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ nea wopɛ ho.
Scary.	Ɛyɛ hu.
That was a surprise.	Ná ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
All the perfect ones.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ pɛ nyinaa.
It wasn’t just about him.	Ná ɛnyɛ ne ho asɛm kɛkɛ.
Please believe, believe, please.	Mesrɛ wo gye di, gye di, mesrɛ wo.
We will do our best.	Yɛbɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara.
That’s why he was here.	Ɛno nti na na ɔwɔ ha no.
I drive a used car.	Meka kar a wɔde adi dwuma.
I'm just a man with a job to do.	Meyɛ ɔbarima a mewɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ara kwa.
Apparently I did.	Ɛda adi sɛ meyɛɛ saa.
We have a lot going on around here.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha ho.
And more time to spend with your kids.	Na bere pii a wode bɛbɔ wo mma no.
Get out a little bit.	Fi adi kakra.
There is a.	Ɛwɔ hɔ.
The rumors are just rumors.	Nsɛm a wɔka no yɛ nsɛm a wɔka ara kwa.
Sign here, sign here and sign here.	Fa wo nsa hyɛ ase wɔ ha, fa wo nsa hyɛ ase wɔ ha na fa wo nsa hyɛ ase wɔ ha.
I keep thinking about it.	Mekɔ so susuw ho.
It’s just not too late.	Ɛnyɛ nea aka akyi dodo kɛkɛ.
It’s still working.	Ɛda so ara reyɛ adwuma.
That’s what they tell me, anyway.	Ɛno ne nea wɔka kyerɛ me, ɔkwan biara so.
I am a weakling.	Meyɛ obi a meyɛ mmerɛw.
What a shot it is.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ tuo.
The time to act is now.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi ne mprempren.
At least that’s what it looked like.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne nea na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte.
No one could help you.	Obiara antumi aboa wo.
I didn't need to know the details.	Ná enhia sɛ mihu nsɛm no mu nsɛm.
You can see a lot of new stuff now.	Wubetumi ahu nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ foforo mprempren.
In a big city, there are many languages.	Wɔ kurow kɛse bi mu no, kasa ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
He knew everything.	Ná onim biribiara.
Most animals hibernate.	Mmoa dodow no ara da awɔw bere mu.
Neither task was easy.	Adwuma abien no mu biara amma mmerɛw.
You don’t have to do that either.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ saa.
He looked at her with interest.	Ɔde anigye hwɛɛ no.
Often, it is not.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛnte saa.
Everyone uses their stuff.	Obiara de wɔn nneɛma di dwuma.
And if they do.	Na sɛ wɔyɛ saa a.
I know you from it all.	Minim wo fi ne nyinaa mu.
But it was too much.	Nanso na ɛdɔɔso dodo.
Children bring joy.	Mmofra de anigye ba.
It’s not such a pretty thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ a ɛte saa.
It was like a city within a city.	Ná ɛte sɛ kurow bi a ɛwɔ kurow bi mu.
I don’t want to do anything about it.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ ho hwee.
That one is harder.	Saa biako no yɛ den sen saa.
These things will save lives.	Saa nneɛma yi begye nnipa nkwa.
Easy, but wrong.	Ɛnyɛ den, nanso ɛyɛ mfomso.
Itself is a lie.	Ankasa yɛ atoro.
But please, please.	Nanso mesrɛ wo.
His father was a good man.	Ná ne papa yɛ onipa pa.
They were very fond of each other.	Ná wɔn ani gye wɔn ho wɔn ho ho yiye.
This also applies to who you are.	Eyi fa onipa a wobɛyɛ nso ho.
The conclusion is that it is wrong.	Nea wɔde ba awiei ne sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
We are all not well.	Yɛn nyinaa nyɛ yiye.
But this is not the case either.	Nanso eyi nso nte saa.
His dog lies at his feet.	Ne kraman no da ne nan ase.
That makes it important.	Ɛno ma ɛho hia.
These things are important.	Saa nneɛma yi ho hia.
What does that make you want to do.	Dɛn na ɛno ma wopɛ sɛ woyɛ.
His father had sent him to a good school.	Ná ne papa de no akɔ sukuu pa.
The curls of his hair.	Ne ti nhwi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no.
You can check them out here if you’re interested.	Wubetumi ahwɛ wɔn wɔ ha sɛ w’ani gye ho a.
The water would be fresh.	Ná nsu no bɛyɛ foforo.
He’s a good guy, and we like him.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa, na yɛn ani gye ne ho.
He did it for fun.	Ɔyɛɛ saa de gyee n’ani.
I have some here.	Mewɔ bi wɔ ha.
Nor should it be.	Saa ara nso na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
Inside they were worse.	Wɔ mu no na wɔyɛ bɔne sen saa.
So, finally, the girl told them.	Enti, awiei koraa no, abeawa no ka kyerɛɛ wɔn.
We have to use it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde di dwuma.
I only saw him yesterday.	Nnɛra nkutoo na mihuu no.
I can be there for them.	Metumi ayɛ hɔ ama wɔn.
Make it a good one.	Ma ɛnyɛ nea eye.
There is nothing better.	Biribiara nni hɔ a eye sen saa.
He impressed everyone with his surprise	Ɔde ne nwonwa no maa obiara ani gyee ho
This happened this year.	Eyi sii afe yi.
Once I think of it as work.	Bere bi misusuw ho sɛ adwuma.
And you have some really good stuff going on.	Na wowɔ nneɛma pa ankasa bi a ɛrekɔ so.
I sleep fast every night.	Meda ntɛmntɛm anadwo biara.
He wants his home.	Ɔpɛ ne fie.
This is what we do.	Eyi ne nea yɛyɛ.
And nothing can do that.	Na biribiara ntumi nyɛ saa.
That was a great thing.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade kɛse.
She did that every morning at home.	Ná ɔyɛ saa anɔpa biara wɔ fie.
It was a terrifying prospect.	Ná ɛyɛ anidaso a ɛyɛ hu.
Nothing but mistakes.	Biribiara nni hɔ gye mfomso ahorow.
That is your right.	Ɛno ne hokwan a wowɔ.
Time was always moving faster.	Ná bere rekɔ ntɛmntɛm bere nyinaa.
But that’s the best we can do.	Nanso ɛno ne nea eye sen biara a yebetumi ayɛ.
It all seemed too daunting for him.	Ne nyinaa yɛɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu dodo ma no.
I knew where it was going so early in the film.	Ná minim baabi a ɛrekɔ ntɛm saa wɔ sini no mu.
None of them work.	Wɔn mu biara nyɛ adwuma.
It was the only car on the road.	Ná ɛno nkutoo ne kar a ɛwɔ kwan no so.
He has the right to do so.	Ɔwɔ ho kwan sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
In the books he is a complex character.	Wɔ nhoma ahorow no mu no ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ den.
It seems like it should be then.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa bere no.
But I can’t do that.	Nanso me ntumi nyɛ saa.
But it still lurked in the back of my mind.	Nanso na ɛda so ara ahyɛ m’adwene akyi.
However, only two of them are free.	Nanso, wɔn mu baanu pɛ na wɔde wɔn ho.
After that man.	Saa ɔbarima no akyi.
Everyone just looked at him.	Obiara hwɛɛ no ​​ara kwa.
These findings reveal many important points.	Saa nsɛm yi ma nsɛm pii a ɛho hia da adi.
My mother has had it, and no one can have it anymore.	Me maame anya bi, na obiara ntumi nnya bio.
This city is famous for its music scene.	Saa kurow yi agye din wɔ nnwom a ɛwɔ mu no ho.
But everything is in due course.	Nanso biribiara wɔ bere a ɛsɛ mu.
No wonder there is a desire.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ ɔpɛ wɔ hɔ.
Make them important.	Ma wɔn ho nhia.
Talk about it with someone.	Wo ne obi nka ho asɛm.
What to do about them comes later.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔn ho asɛm no ba akyiri yi.
I hardly knew him.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na minnim no.
And maybe next month.	Na ebia ɔsram a edi hɔ no nso.
If you get better every day, only.	Sɛ wo ho yɛ den da biara da, nkutoo.
It must have been difficult for them.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ den maa wɔn.
This winter has been pretty easy.	Awɔw bere yi ayɛ mmerɛw yiye.
That is not a good way.	Ɛno nyɛ ɔkwan pa.
The work was huge.	Ná adwuma no yɛ kɛse.
That’s just nothing.	Ɛno nyɛ hwee kɛkɛ.
In these cases, things are very clear.	Wɔ saa nsɛm yi mu no, nneɛma mu da hɔ yiye.
I was glad he was there.	M’ani gyee ho sɛ na ɔwɔ hɔ.
Something had happened.	Ná biribi aba.
There are definitely a variety of interests to play with.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nneɛma ahorow a wɔn ani gye ho wɔ hɔ a wɔde di agoru.
However, the efficiency is not very good.	Nanso, sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma yiye no nyɛ papa koraa.
I think he has a game to really improve on.	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ agoru bi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no yiye ankasa.
That was his first mistake.	Ɛno ne ne mfomso a edi kan.
Trouble is, it definitely works.	Ɔhaw ne sɛ, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
It’s not really about that.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ho asɛm ankasa.
He was in a car.	Ná ɔte kar bi mu.
It may look like a necessary evil.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ sɛ bɔne a ɛho hia.
Many of them are for cash and cash only.	Wɔn mu pii yɛ sika ne sika nkutoo de.
That took time.	Ɛno gyee bere.
Most books suck.	Nhoma dodow no ara su.
No one ever does that.	Obiara nyɛ saa da.
Always look for the positive.	Hwɛ nneɛma pa bere nyinaa.
That was quick.	Ná ɛno yɛ ntɛm.
I don't like it.	M'ani nnye ho.
It’s a hard game to get good at.	Ɛyɛ agoru a ɛyɛ den sɛ wubetumi ayɛ yiye.
However, it seemed to work.	Nanso, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma.
You want it me? 	Wopɛ no me?
he says that.	ɔka sɛ.
Thank you for being you.	Meda wo ase sɛ woyɛ wo.
He seemed to do the talking.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔno na ɔbɛyɛ kasa no.
There’s actually a filmmaking scene and it’s not that old.	Ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa a wɔde yɛ sini na ɛnyɛ dedaw saa.
But other than that, this book is perfect.	Nanso sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, nhoma yi yɛ pɛ.
His father is actually my father.	Ne papa yɛ me papa ankasa.
I will give you all the details.	Mede nsɛm no nyinaa bɛma wo.
I wanted to do it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ.
I have a plan, and it just might work.	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe bi, na ebia ɛbɛyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
It was just one picture.	Ná ɛyɛ mfonini biako pɛ.
He looked the same.	Ná ne ho te saa ara.
They are beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
I think he just wanted to be with her.	Misusuw sɛ na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka ne ho kɛkɛ.
Lots of fun.	Anigye pii.
These people have no idea how lucky they are.	Saa nkurɔfo yi nni sɛnea wɔn ani gye no ho adwene biara.
There is a film of me out there.	Me ho sini bi wɔ hɔ wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
And we had to do that a lot.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa pii.
His wife was not there.	Ná ne yere nni hɔ.
Even then, it wasn’t the same.	Ɛno mpo no, na ɛnyɛ ade koro.
It seems to be all put together.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔde ne nyinaa abɔ mu.
And he wasn’t alone.	Na ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
But where did you put it?	Nanso ɛhe na wode too hɔ?
My father agreed with me on many points.	Na me papa ne me yɛ adwene wɔ nsɛm pii ho.
He uses his hands.	Ɔde ne nsa di dwuma.
A terrible thought.	Adwene a ɛyɛ hu.
I couldn’t understand that.	Ná mintumi nte saa asɛm no ase.
I have things to do.	Mewɔ nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
Beautiful scenery on our main street.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ a ɛwɔ yɛn abɔnten kɛse no so.
He talks to me.	Ɔne me kasa.
The pictures only show people.	Mfonini ahorow no kyerɛ nnipa nkutoo.
He is such a vulnerable person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw saa.
It’s a wonderful story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
In either case, walk away.	Wɔ tebea abien no nyinaa mu no, nantew kɔ.
But it is not a complete story.	Nanso ɛnyɛ asɛm a edi mũ.
He was always worried about her.	Ná ne ho asɛm haw no bere nyinaa.
That was his nature.	Ná ɛno ne ne su.
The present moment is the only time.	Mprempren bere yi nkutoo ne bere a ɛwɔ hɔ.
They pretty much do everything they need to do.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribiara a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Trust me, you don’t want to know.	Gye me di, wompɛ sɛ wuhu.
Lots of work to be done.	Adwuma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
In this case, both were present.	Wɔ eyi mu no, na abien no nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
He wanted to hear more.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte nsɛm pii.
You have one chance.	Wowɔ hokwan biako.
It was a lot of fun though.	Na ɛyɛ anigye pii de, nanso.
And go beyond that.	Na kɔ akyiri sen saa.
There was a squirrel .	Ná ɔkraman bi wɔ hɔ .
He told himself it was for the best.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
It was very cold.	Ná awɔw wom paa.
There is something good for these people.	Biribi wɔ hɔ a eye ma saa nkurɔfo yi.
He wanted nothing to do with her.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔne no yɛ hwee.
But he never seemed to have enough.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea onni nea ɛdɔɔso da.
But he did it.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ saa.
There’s a limited amount we can eat at a time.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ kakraa bi a yebetumi adi bere koro mu.
You are lucky to work with him.	Wowɔ anigye sɛ wo ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
The rest fell on his head.	Nea aka no hwee ne ti so.
I think it’s kind of interesting.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ anigye asɛm bi.
Very good, you can come if you want.	Eye paa, sɛ wopɛ a, wubetumi aba.
You can use it daily or business.	Wubetumi de adi dwuma da biara da anaa adwuma.
That part was great.	Ná saa fã no yɛ kɛse.
I have a lot on my hands.	Nneɛma pii wɔ me nsa so.
I love the look of it.	M’ani gye sɛnea ɛte no ho.
They were true friends.	Ná wɔyɛ nnamfo ankasa.
This all happened many years ago.	Eyi nyinaa sii mfe pii a atwam ni.
You don’t have to do anything!	Ɛho nhia sɛ woyɛ biribi!
And it does it really well.	Na ɛyɛ no yiye ankasa.
We can hand you over to the police right now.	Yebetumi de wo ahyɛ polisifo nsa mprempren ara.
Wear nice clothes.	Hyɛ ntade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I’m so excited about that.	M’ani agye saa asɛm no ho yiye.
I could never play that now.	Na mintumi nyɛ saa agoru no mprempren da.
I need to know these things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu saa nneɛma yi.
This is a real-time strategy game.	Eyi yɛ bere ankasa mu nhyehyɛe ho agoru.
Or maybe someone.	Anaasɛ ebia obi.
Every child has toys.	Abofra biara wɔ nneɛma a wɔde di agoru.
Maybe it wasn’t.	Ebia na ɛnte saa.
To overcome this problem, one must add additional factors.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ na obi adi ɔhaw yi so no, ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde nneɛma foforo ka ho.
They didn’t have to.	Ná enhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
And that is indeed what happened.	Na ɛno ne nea esii ampa.
All in all, it was a lot of fun.	Ne nyinaa mu no, na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
And he knew that.	Na na onim saa.
Many people don’t know that.	Nnipa pii nnim saa asɛm no.
Interesting, and not surprising at all.	Ɛyɛ anigye, na ɛnyɛ nwonwa koraa.
First of all, that is not true.	Nea edi kan koraa no, ɛno nyɛ nokware.
Not the other way around !!!.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan foforo so !!!.
The plan is significant.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛ nea ɛho hia.
I would tell him everything.	Ná mɛka biribiara akyerɛ no.
He was the one who told me to do this.	Ɔno na ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ menyɛ eyi.
Once again, for two reasons.	Saa bere yi nso, nneɛma abien nti na ɛte saa.
Those were wonderful days, wonderful days.	Ná ɛno yɛ nna a ɛyɛ nwonwa, nna a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani gye ho paa.
Don’t make this difficult.	Mma eyi nyɛ den.
There was very little bad language.	Ná kasa bɔne kakraa bi pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
All this, and the comments.	Eyi nyinaa, ne nsɛm a wɔka no.
It may be in the testing phase right now.	Ebia ɛwɔ sɔhwɛ fã no mu mprempren ara.
Heat it up.	Hyɛ no hyew.
I have another job for you.	Mewɔ adwuma foforo ma wo.
It simply is your next book.	Nea ɛyɛ ara ne wo nhoma a edi hɔ no.
If anyone can help him, he certainly can.	Sɛ obi betumi aboa no a, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ obetumi.
Either way, he added, nothing is certain.	Ɔde kaa ho sɛ, ɔkwan biara so no, biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nokware.
At least not that he could see.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nea na obetumi ahu.
I draw like a child.	Meyɛ mfonini te sɛ abofra.
I forget about myself.	Me werɛ fi me ho.
I have been using it ever since.	Mede adi dwuma fi saa bere no.
He has the last word in everything.	Ɔwɔ asɛm a etwa to wɔ biribiara mu.
We do the same thing.	Yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa ara.
You can’t keep up with him.	Worentumi nkɔ so ne no nkɔ.
Make them if you want.	Yɛ wɔn sɛ wopɛ a.
I think it would be better if no one went.	Misusuw sɛ sɛ obiara ankɔ a, anka ɛbɛyɛ papa.
I wasn’t too hot.	Ná me ho nyɛ hyew dodo.
So think about the things you love, think about what you love to do.	Enti susuw nneɛma a w’ani gye ho no ho, susuw nea w’ani gye ho sɛ wobɛyɛ no ho.
I have that.	Mewɔ saa.
He was very excited.	Ná n’ani agye kɛse.
At least that was how it used to be.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na na ɛte kan no.
Water is very soft.	Nsu yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Neither of us said a word.	Yɛn mu biara anka asɛm biara.
We are not alone.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn nkutoo.
, '.	, '.
This was well known.	Ná eyi nim yiye.
That’s all there is to it.	Ɛno nkutoo.
There is a need for immediate action.	Ɛho hia sɛ wɔyɛ ade ntɛm ara.
It’s in my way.	Ɛwɔ me kwan so.
You are not doing everything you can do.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara a wubetumi ayɛ na woreyɛ.
The same was true in his mind.	Saa ara na na ɛte wɔ n’adwene mu.
The population grew rapidly.	Nnipa dodow kɔɔ anim ntɛmntɛm.
I just shrugged it off.	Mede me nsa kyerɛɛ so kɛkɛ.
It’s not about the resources.	Ɛnyɛ nneɛma a wɔde yɛ adwuma no ho asɛm.
I don’t have any children.	Minni mma biara.
Eat as much as you want.	Di aduan dodow biara a wopɛ.
Nothing else for me.	Biribiara foforo biara nni hɔ ma me.
He had no idea it was this bad.	Ná onni adwene biara sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne yi.
So do you me.	Saa ara nso na wo me.
The game was fun.	Ná agoru no yɛ anigye.
I don’t think he knew either way.	Minsusuw sɛ na onim ɔkwan biara so.
And here is a remarkable story.	Na asɛm bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa ni.
A year had passed.	Ná afe biako atwam.
And best friends trust each other.	Na nnamfo paa gye wɔn ho wɔn ho di.
It just has to be that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa ara kwa.
I can’t lie to you.	Mintumi nni atoro nkyerɛ wo.
Other than that, forget it.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, wo werɛ mfi no.
We'd better head home.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ yɛde yɛn ani kyerɛ fie.
That made me feel better.	Ɛno maa me ho tɔɔ me.
I didn’t have a home.	Ná minni fie.
None of them know here.	Wɔn mu biara nnim ha.
You look a little like him.	Wo ho te sɛ ɔno kakra.
He says it was easy for him to focus in that situation.	Ɔka sɛ na ɛnyɛ den mma no sɛ ɔde n’adwene besi saa tebea no mu.
I knew how to work there.	Ná minim sɛnea mɛyɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ.
But yet still there.	Nanso nanso ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
The same thing, really.	Ade koro no ara, ampa.
However, humans cannot.	Nanso, nnipa ntumi nyɛ saa.
You can have them if you want.	Wubetumi anya wɔn sɛ wopɛ a.
He was an only child.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra koro pɛ.
Take as many as you want.	Fa dodow biara a wopɛ.
I know the city well.	Minim kurow no yiye.
I don’t want you here.	Mempɛ wo ha.
There is no backend method.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ a wɔde di dwuma wɔ akyi.
So was he, too.	Saa ara na na ɔno nso te.
It’s just amazing and awesome.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa na ɛyɛ hu ara kwa.
The water here is still very warm.	Nsu a ɛwɔ ha no da so ara yɛ hyew yiye.
If this sounds good, you’ll love it.	Sɛ eyi te sɛ nea eye a, w’ani begye ho.
He could do this, and he should do this.	Ná obetumi ayɛ eyi, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ eyi.
That is the wise thing to do.	Ɛno ne ade a nyansa wom a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
They are friends now.	Wɔyɛ nnamfo mprempren.
Great idea.	Adwene kɛse.
As this was just the first of many.	Sɛnea na eyi yɛ pii mu nea edi kan ara kwa no.
I saw the problem.	Mihuu ɔhaw no.
It is not a system.	Ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
It’s not very surprising.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa kɛse.
He knew his father better than before.	Ná onim ne papa sen kan no.
I am here for the first time.	Mewɔ ha nea edi kan.
There may be several reasons.	Ebia nneɛma pii nti na ɛte saa.
A test of sorts.	Sɔhwɛ a ɛyɛ ɔkwan bi so.
That’s why we’re here.	Ɛno nti na yɛwɔ ha no.
There is still little water.	Nsu kakraa bi na ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
I want an evening alone.	Mepɛ sɛ me nkutoo tra anwummere biako.
Very long, something strange.	Ne tenten paa, biribi yɛ nwonwa.
Not even for a moment.	Ɛnyɛ bere tiaa bi mpo.
It is the same to this day.	Ɛte saa ara de besi nnɛ.
But there is much more to do now.	Nanso nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ mprempren.
A sense of entitlement.	Te a obi te nka sɛ ɔwɔ hokwan.
In other words, the snake is nothing at all.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ɔwɔ no nyɛ hwee koraa.
It’s not that easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
And there are a lot of people who don’t like it.	Na nnipa pii wɔ hɔ a wɔn ani nnye ho.
All the entries were great in their own right.	Na nsɛm a wɔde hyɛɛ mu no nyinaa yɛ kɛse wɔ wɔn ankasa mu.
All the wines were very very strong.	Ná nsa no nyinaa mu yɛ den yiye paa.
This can have a variety of negative consequences.	Eyi betumi de nneɛma bɔne ahorow pii afi mu aba.
I think you are too young to work here!	Misusuw sɛ woyɛ abofra dodo sɛ wobɛyɛ adwuma wɔ ha!
That’s important for a lot.	Ɛno ho hia ma biribi pii.
Maybe the books are there.	Ebia nhoma ahorow no wɔ hɔ.
I gave them my best stuff.	Mede me nneɛma a eye sen biara maa wɔn.
You would know them.	Anka wunim wɔn.
There were hardly any police at the time.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na polisifo biara nni hɔ saa bere no.
I had a lot to say.	Ná mewɔ nsɛm pii a mɛka.
It’s true and you know it.	Ɛyɛ nokware na wunim.
I can give you some names.	Metumi ama wo din ahorow bi.
She did not want to have to tell her son these things.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka saa nsɛm yi kyerɛ ne ba no.
We hope you use it again.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wode bedi dwuma bio.
You are in for a very, very long night.	Wowɔ anadwo tenten paa, paa mu.
A day of nothing but the truth.	Da koro a hwee nni hɔ gye nokware no.
Keep up the good work.	Kɔ so yɛ adwuma no.
Remove the parchment paper.	Yi krataa a wɔde aboa nhoma ayɛ no fi hɔ.
But this is not the only thing they all have in common.	Nanso ɛnyɛ eyi ne ade biako pɛ a wɔn nyinaa yɛ biako.
Or maybe he wasn’t.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɔnyɛ saa.
But this is not the case now.	Nanso eyi nte saa mprempren.
Rumors or stories also play a big role.	Nsɛm a wɔka anaa nsɛm a wɔka nso di dwuma kɛse.
Maybe he can.	Ebia obetumi.
Don’t just listen to what he has to say.	Mma nte nea ɔwɔ ka no mu nsɛm kɛkɛ.
Not so long ago now.	Ɛnyɛ bere tenten ni mprempren.
If you think you can play, you can play.	Sɛ wususuw sɛ wubetumi adi agoru a, wubetumi adi agoru.
And one leg, too.	Na nan biako nso.
He knows you.	Onim wo.
Do another morning tomorrow morning.	Yɛ anɔpa foforo ɔkyena anɔpa.
They tell us.	Wɔka kyerɛ yɛn.
I was actually doing that.	Ná meyɛ saa ankasa.
However, it is not.	Nanso, ɛnte saa.
That’s what they had to do.	Ɛno ne nea na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
As it should be.	Sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no.
Sleep was full and hard.	Ná nna ayɛ ma na ɛyɛ den.
I know it’s him.	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno.
I have a copy of this book.	Mewɔ nhoma yi bi.
There was absolutely no one else, just us.	Ná obi foforo biara nni hɔ koraa, yɛn nkutoo.
But it was there.	Nanso na ɛwɔ hɔ.
But many did.	Nanso pii yɛɛ saa.
There is nothing behind it.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛda akyi.
Anyway, you're right.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, woayɛ no yiye.
The story is over.	Asɛm no aba awiei.
Let me do my best to get rid of it.	Ma menyɛ nea metumi biara mfa mfi hɔ.
It’s too cold.	Ɛyɛ awɔw dodo.
This is really a really daunting task.	Eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ hu ankasa ankasa.
You are strong as a man.	Wo ho yɛ den sɛ ɔbarima.
And it was exciting.	Na na ɛyɛ anigye.
He always had it.	Ná ɔwɔ bi bere nyinaa.
I truly believe that now.	Migye di saa ampa mprempren.
It’s just a little painful.	Ɛyɛ yaw kakra kɛkɛ.
Prices fell by half.	Nneɛma bo kɔɔ fam fã.
You know how important every game is.	Wunim sɛnea agoru biara ho hia.
They were good, but not that good.	Ná wɔyɛ papa, nanso na ɛnyɛ papa saa.
Keep your eyes open.	Ma w’ani nna hɔ.
What it was like after that.	Sɛnea na ɛte wɔ ɛno akyi.
I feel like I’m happy.	Mete nka sɛ m’ani agye.
It wasn’t an idea he had.	Ná ɛnyɛ adwene bi a ɔwɔ.
If you have the power.	Sɛ wowɔ tumi a.
That took much longer.	Ɛno gyee bere tenten sen saa koraa.
That thing is not my problem anyway.	Saa ade no nyɛ me haw ɔkwan biara so.
The dog latched onto my leg.	Ɔkraman no de ne nsa bɔɔ me nan so.
We hope you will do the same.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wo nso wobɛyɛ saa ara.
There must be more of them out there.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
That was bad overall.	Ná ɛno yɛ bɔne wɔ ne nyinaa mu.
These people are real to us.	Saa nnipa yi yɛ nnipa ankasa ma yɛn.
I want the same for my son.	Mepɛ saa ara ma me ba no.
And more on the way today.	Na pii wɔ kwan so nnɛ.
It is large enough not enough.	Ɛyɛ kɛse a ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
But it is even more dangerous.	Nanso ɛyɛ hu sen kan no mpo.
So that’s going really well.	Enti ɛno rekɔ so yiye ankasa.
I love the game.	M’ani gye agoru no ho.
It’s a lot of it.	Ɛyɛ pii.
He is a day early.	Ɔyɛ da koro ntɛm.
That is our problem.	Ɛno ne yɛn haw.
He was engrossed in his book.	Ná ɔde ne ho ahyɛ ne nhoma no mu.
However, it may be difficult.	Nanso, ebia ɛbɛyɛ den.
Thank you both so much.	Meda mo baanu nyinaa ase pii.
I don’t want to have to do that.	Mempɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
But it’s not a perfect game.	Nanso ɛnyɛ agoru a edi mũ.
You are our very best.	Woyɛ yɛn papa paa.
You can see it from that.	Wubetumi ahu no afi ɛno mu.
We have to be committed.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde yɛn ho ma.
Simple, but crucial.	Ɛnyɛ den, nanso ɛho hia kɛse.
It wasn’t your business before.	Ná ɛnyɛ wo asɛm kan.
It doesn’t matter to me anymore.	Ɛnyɛ me asɛm bio.
Need a place soon.	Hia baabi ntɛm.
We need to do both.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ abien no nyinaa.
You said you would be good to him.	Wokae sɛ wobɛyɛ papa ama no.
And you’re a good one, too.	Na wo nso woyɛ papa.
It was a beautiful city.	Ná ɛyɛ kurow bi a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Maybe it was new.	Ebia na ɛyɛ foforo.
Play it.	Bɔ no.
I really feel strong.	Mete nka ankasa sɛ me ho yɛ den.
A number of items fell to the ground.	Nneɛma dodow bi hwee fam.
That was something.	Ná ɛno yɛ biribi.
We do it all the time.	Yɛyɛ no bere nyinaa.
The shoes are expensive.	Mpaboa no bo yɛ den.
Unless they do something.	Gye sɛ wɔyɛ biribi.
Scary.	Ɛyɛ hu.
The girl's face fell.	Abeawa no anim hwee ase.
Or the cost of it.	Anaasɛ ɛho ka.
He will be great for us for a long, long time.	Ɔbɛyɛ kɛse ama yɛn bere tenten, bere tenten.
But it’s perfect.	Nanso ɛyɛ pɛ.
Like you, a beautiful one.	Te sɛ wo, obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Go to the front support.	Kɔ anim mmoa no so.
He could happily do so.	Ná obetumi de anigye ayɛ saa.
You don’t have to talk about bad things.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woka nneɛma bɔne ho asɛm.
The book was an immediate success.	Nhoma no dii yiye ntɛm ara.
The mind works the same way.	Adwene no nso yɛ adwuma saa ara.
The night was clear.	Ná anadwo no mu da hɔ.
I can’t tell you much.	Mintumi nka pii nkyerɛ wo.
We need to do something about that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa asɛm no ho biribi.
The man lives outside and does not have a phone.	Ɔbarima no te abɔnten na onni telefon.
Some things had to be said.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka nsɛm bi.
You have to do those things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa nneɛma no.
This city is beautiful.	Saa kurow yi yɛ fɛ yiye.
That can be very successful.	Ɛno betumi adi nkonim yiye.
This walk was really amazing.	Ná saa nantew yi yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
But the game was fantastic.	Nanso na agoru no yɛ nwonwa.
Throughout the year.	Wɔ afe no mu nyinaa.
He thinks of his children.	Osusuw ne mma ho.
It’s always hot.	Ɛyɛ hyew bere nyinaa.
For the time being.	Mprempren de.
I know this city well.	Minim kurow yi yiye.
The best of the.	Nea eye sen biara wɔ.
There was nothing else to be had.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
I wanted the best for him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ eye ma no.
I have no plans to do so.	Minni nhyehyɛe biara a mede bɛyɛ saa.
This is my favorite picture.	Eyi ne mfonini a m’ani gye ho paa.
We may work this evening.	Ebia yɛbɛyɛ adwuma anwummere yi.
He’s a bad boy.	Ɔyɛ abarimaa bɔne.
It seemed years ago.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea mfe bi a atwam ni.
But nobody really gives much away about them.	Nanso obiara mfa wɔn ho asɛm pii mma ankasa.
Experiment, one two three.	Sɔhwɛ, biako abien abiɛsa.
Leave the house often.	Fi fie hɔ mpɛn pii.
But it didn’t really work.	Nanso anyɛ adwuma ankasa.
There is nothing better for him to enjoy.	Biribiara nni hɔ a n’ani begye ho a eye sen saa.
The same is true of virtue.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ su pa ho.
He was in there.	Ná ɔwɔ mu wɔ hɔ.
That must have shocked people.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛno maa nkurɔfo ho dwiriw wɔn.
It doesn’t hurt.	Ɛnyɛ yaw.
Go back soon.	San kɔ ntɛm.
The present moment.	Mprempren bere yi.
He didn't know what to do next.	Ná onnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nea edi hɔ.
He doesn’t seem to have any friends.	Ɛte sɛ nea onni nnamfo biara.
For enough speech.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a kasa a ɛdɔɔso.
That is a huge risk.	Ɛno yɛ asiane kɛse.
All the features are here.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no nyinaa wɔ ha.
It seemed like a good plan that would work well for me.	Ná ɛte sɛ nhyehyɛe pa a ɛbɛyɛ adwuma yiye ama me.
Two cars were stuck in the driveway.	Kar abien kaa kar kwan no so.
Some elements of the system still need work.	Nneɛma bi a ɛwɔ nhyehyɛe no mu da so ara hia adwuma.
It was a good night.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo pa.
Said thanks for the help.	Kaa sɛ meda ase wɔ mmoa no ho.
Many people had told many people.	Ná nnipa pii aka akyerɛ nnipa pii.
He had an exam tomorrow.	Ná ɔwɔ sɔhwɛ ɔkyena.
Is the biggest problem right now.	So ɔhaw kɛse no ne mprempren ara.
It’s wonderful, you know.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa, wunim.
I guess that wasn’t bad in itself.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno ankasa nyɛ bɔne.
He is a dishonest man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a onni nokware.
Or maybe he did some bad things.	Anaasɛ ebia ɔyɛɛ nneɛma bɔne bi.
I forgot about them.	Me werɛ fii wɔn.
But there seems to be a mistake.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea mfomso bi wɔ hɔ.
That was a very good point.	Ná ɛno yɛ asɛm a eye paa.
When you wear them.	Bere a wo hyɛ wɔn.
And he signed up to do so.	Na ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ ase sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I have a reason for that.	Mewɔ nea enti a ɛte saa.
Be fluid as usual.	Yɛ nsu sɛnea ɛte da biara.
She is so beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ saa.
And it didn’t matter.	Na ɛnyɛ hwee.
This water serves many functions.	Saa nsu yi di nnwuma ahorow pii ho dwuma.
The money was there.	Ná sika no wɔ hɔ.
The boy looked up at his father.	Abofra no maa n’ani so hwɛɛ ne papa.
Give your homework now.	Fa wo fie nnwuma ma mprempren.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He wants to succeed.	Ɔpɛ sɛ odi yiye.
I can’t think of anyone else.	Mintumi nsusuw obi foforo biara ho.
It just doesn’t seem very common right now.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nea abu so kɛse mprempren ara kwa.
Don’t let the dog out of your sight.	Mma ɔkraman no mfi w’ani so.
He wasn’t good.	Ná ɔnyɛ papa.
He was outside that house.	Ná ɔwɔ saa fie no akyi.
Get involved in it.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu.
But something still bothers him.	Nanso biribi da so ara haw no.
Give what you want to receive.	Fa nea wopɛ sɛ wo nsa ka no ma.
I am completely in it.	Meyɛ mu koraa.
The prospects were daunting.	Ná anidaso no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani gyee ho paa.
Except not this table.	Gye sɛ ɛnyɛ saa pon yi.
My kids needed the best of me.	Ná me mma hia nea eye sen biara wɔ me ho.
And yet.	Na nanso.
Your hands start to hurt.	Wo nsa fi ase yɛ wo yaw.
He had never done that before.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa da.
Her opinion mattered to him.	Ná n’adwene ho hia no.
He is not entirely averse to the idea.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ɔmpɛ adwene no koraa.
You’ve done that.	Woayɛ saa.
I still think we have that.	Meda so ara susuw sɛ yɛwɔ saa.
All of them are invested.	Wɔde sika ahyɛ wɔn nyinaa mu.
You know better.	Wo na wunim yiye.
I think there are two things going on there.	Misusuw sɛ nneɛma abien na ɛrekɔ so wɔ hɔ.
But it was a different era then.	Nanso na ɛyɛ bere foforo saa bere no.
And yet, quite the same.	Na nanso, saa ara koraa.
He had his eyes on me.	Ná n’ani asi me so.
But something must have happened.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ sɛ biribi sii.
I know everyone is busy.	Minim sɛ obiara nni adagyew.
I think that’s true.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
Go quickly, though.	Nanso, kɔ ntɛm.
He wasn’t interested.	Ná n’ani nnye ho.
I didn't know why, but that didn't matter.	Ná minnim nea enti a ɛte saa, nanso na ɛno ho nhia.
That is not realistic.	Ɛno nyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
The latter was impossible.	Ná nea etwa to no ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Maybe it’s just something.	Ebia ɛyɛ biribi a ɛwɔ hɔ ara kwa.
But too much is definitely not a good thing.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ pii dodo nyɛ ade pa.
Be interested in your product.	Yɛ nnipa a wɔn ani gye wo nneɛma no ho.
The plan collapsed.	Nhyehyɛe no hwee ase.
If he does, he can win.	Sɛ ɔyɛ saa a, obetumi adi nkonim.
Her makeup was flawless.	Ná mfomso biara nni ne ho a ɔde yɛ ne ho no.
Maybe something similar happened here.	Ebia biribi a ɛte saa ara sii wɔ ha.
I do indeed do that.	Meyɛ saa ampa.
A long, long time ago.	Bere tenten, bere tenten a atwam.
Many and one.	Pii ne biako.
It was a little unlike you.	Ná ɛnte sɛ wo ara kakra.
He knows his half.	Onim ne fã.
I believe it will be.	Migye di sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
No one does, really.	Obiara nyɛ saa, ampa.
It’s quite good.	Ɛyɛ papa koraa.
You’ll love that in no time.	W’ani begye saa asɛm no ho wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
That’s all true.	Ɛno nyinaa yɛ nokware.
I just wanted to be famous.	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye din ara kwa.
There would never be another after today.	Anka foforo biara nni hɔ da wɔ nnɛ akyi.
I don’t know for sure, and you certainly don’t.	Minnim no yiye, na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wunnim.
It was almost as big as my forearm.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ne kɛse te sɛ me nsa a ɛwɔ anim no.
He has been very good.	Wayɛ papa paa.
The house next to it.	Ofie a ɛwɔ ɛno nkyɛn no.
A little is enough.	Kakraa bi na ɛdɔɔso.
You should talk to me about it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne me kasa fa ho.
They are very happy.	Wɔn ani gye paa.
The music was beautiful.	Ná nnwom no yɛ fɛ.
Resources are available immediately.	Nneɛma a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma no wɔ hɔ ntɛm ara.
In order to do so.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wobɛyɛ saa.
He just did it.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​ara kwa.
He glanced away quickly.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ baabi foforo ntɛmntɛm.
Surprisingly, it was true.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa no, na ɛyɛ nokware.
It would have worked well.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
I can't see the error.	Mintumi nhu mfomso no.
They got involved.	Wɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
Is there anything else? 	So biribi foforo wɔ hɔ?
Remove and drain well.	Yi na yi nsu no yiye.
He didn't even know if he could say anything.	Ná onnim mpo sɛ ebia obetumi aka biribi anaa.
That movie was terrible.	Ná saa sini no yɛ hu.
I actually really do that.	Meyɛ saa ankasa ankasa.
Suppose we are in the latter case.	Fa no sɛ yɛwɔ asɛm a etwa to no mu.
I therefore did not want to bring him into this.	Me enti na mempɛ sɛ mede no bɛba eyi mu.
Who he thought he did.	Nea na osusuw sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
It’s been too long.	Ɛyɛ bere tenten dodo.
At the same time.	Bere koro no ara mu.
It was very important.	Ná ɛho hia paa.
You said you could.	Wokae sɛ wubetumi.
I definitely enjoyed it a lot.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ m’ani gyee ho kɛse.
I am still a child.	Meda so ara yɛ abofra.
So that’s what this is.	Enti ɛno ne nea eyi yɛ.
Her beautiful eyes speak of age and wisdom.	N’ani a ɛyɛ fɛ no ka mfe a obi adi ne nyansa ho asɛm.
Maybe it will be.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
But my opinion of the game remains blurry.	Nanso m’adwene wɔ agoru no ho no da so ara yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
It was posted now.	Wɔde too hɔ mprempren.
I can do something for you.	Metumi ayɛ biribi ama wo.
Nothing can surprise me now.	Biribiara ntumi nyɛ me nwonwa mprempren.
Or maybe he wasn’t feeling well.	Anaasɛ ebia na ne ho nyɛ no den.
Maybe that’s it.	Ebia ɛno ne no.
I think that was about something else.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno yɛ biribi foforo ho asɛm.
You really don’t.	Wonyɛ saa ampa.
There really is no other way.	Ɔkwan foforo biara nni hɔ ankasa.
Similar inputs will overlap.	Nsɛm a ɛte saa ara a wɔde hyɛ mu no bɛbɔ mu.
He was weak.	Ná wayɛ mmerɛw.
You can say that.	Wubetumi aka sɛ.
The car was nearby.	Ná kar no bɛn hɔ.
The man runs away.	Ɔbarima no tu mmirika.
I know this is true.	Minim sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
I want something long, but not too long.	Mepɛ biribi tenten, nanso ɛnyɛ tenten dodo.
He loved touching people.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛka nkurɔfo.
Water is essential for all life.	Nsu ho hia ma nkwa nyinaa.
I know it’s not easy, but you can make it look good.	Minim sɛ ɛnyɛ mmerɛw, nanso wubetumi ama ayɛ fɛ.
What, he didn’t know.	Dɛn, na onnim.
Perhaps he had a strange desire to do something else.	Ebia na ɔwɔ ɔpɛ bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ ɔbɛyɛ biribi foforo.
Day or night.	Awia anaa anadwo.
But just take it.	Nanso fa no kɛkɛ.
I was doing the same thing.	Ná me nso meyɛ saa ara.
The project was a success.	Adwuma no dii yiye.
However, it is not necessary to do so.	Nanso, ɛho nhia sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
This is a remarkable thing.	Eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Every season brings new projects.	Bere biara de nnwuma foforo ba.
He spoke many languages.	Ná ɔka kasa ahorow pii.
I use two of them.	Mede abien na edi dwuma.
Eat this water.	Di saa nsu yi.
This is a lot of fun.	Eyi yɛ anigye kɛse.
He feels that there is danger.	Ɔte nka sɛ asiane bi wɔ hɔ.
Like it's no big deal.	Te sɛ nea ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse.
Probably too many.	Ebia pii dodo.
He knows me too well.	Onim me yiye dodo.
I guess I should have known.	Misusuw sɛ anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
My dad took all of last week off work.	Me papa gyee dapɛn a etwaam no nyinaa fii adwumam.
It’s not too late, you know.	Ɛnyɛ nea aka akyi dodo, wunim.
That is a huge risk.	Ɛno yɛ asiane kɛse.
In a city somewhere.	Wɔ kurow bi mu wɔ baabi.
It’s important to us.	Ɛho hia yɛn.
I believe that they should.	Migye di sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
He seemed very, very happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye yiye paa.
It’s quite simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
That was all he did for her.	Ɛno ara ne nea na ɔyɛ ma no.
Here's the problem with that.	Ɔhaw a ɛwɔ saa asɛm no ho ni.
Over the next two years, the problem escalated.	Wɔ mfe abien a edi hɔ no mu no, ɔhaw no mu yɛɛ den kɛse.
This is done very well.	Wɔyɛ eyi yiye paa.
They were not the most eloquent of two people.	Ná ɛnyɛ nnipa baanu a wɔka kasa sen biara.
Be careful, too.	Hwɛ yiye.
I think it’s a learning process.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ adesua nhyehyɛe.
Your hair looks good, by the way.	Wo ti nhwi no yɛ fɛ, ɔkwan bi so no.
So one of the first times is not included.	Enti bere a edi kan no mu biako nka ho.
Risk is one thing.	Asiane yɛ ade biako.
But this is something else.	Nanso eyi yɛ ade foforo.
Just be the same with him.	Wo ne no saa ara kɛkɛ.
I'm just a normal girl.	Meyɛ abeawa a ɔte ase ara kwa.
It had had its day.	Ná anya ne da.
At least that was the case at home.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na na ɛte wɔ fie.
I can't play the game that way.	Mintumi nni agoru no saa kwan no so.
I don’t want to be late.	Mempɛ sɛ meka akyi.
Measure the water carefully.	Susuw nsu no yiye.
I don’t like it here.	M’ani nnye ho wɔ ha.
And you’re just doing it.	Na woreyɛ ara kwa.
The kids stayed outside for a while.	Mmofra no traa abɔnten kakra.
I couldn’t have had it at the time.	Anka mintumi nnya bi wɔ saa bere no mu.
He slipped his hands together.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ mu.
Not every day.	Ɛnyɛ da biara.
Plan for them in advance.	Di kan yɛ nhyehyɛe ma wɔn.
The night was great.	Anadwo no yɛɛ kɛse.
I glanced at all the other kids.	Mede m’ani hwɛɛ mmofra a aka no nyinaa.
This letter went into detail.	Krataa yi kɔɔ akyiri.
Like really good fun.	Te sɛ anigye pa ankasa.
Time goes too fast.	Bere kɔ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
Who is this person ?	Hena ne onipa yi ?
What’s wrong is wrong and it doesn’t matter.	Nea ɛyɛ bɔne no yɛ bɔne na ɛnyɛ hwee.
I want him to touch me.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka me.
Thank you.	Meda wo ase.
We put him there.	Yɛde no too hɔ.
I don’t even know mine.	Minnim me de no mpo.
And yet, here we are.	Na nanso, ha na yɛwɔ.
Maybe it’s not you.	Ebia ɛnyɛ wo.
That’s right, that’s right.	Ɛte saa, ɛte saa.
Someone needs to look after you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi hwɛ wo.
His friends are included.	Ne nnamfo ka ho.
And the reason for that.	Na nea enti a ɛte saa no nso.
Be careful!	Hwɛ yiye!
His hair was matted.	Ná ne ti nhwi ayɛ mmerɛw.
He is here right now.	Ɔwɔ ha seesei ara.
He just told me.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me kɛkɛ.
Not when you think about it.	Ɛnyɛ bere a wususuw ho no.
I feel the floor with my hands.	Mede me nsa te fam no nka.
I look out the window.	Mehwɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
It should be possible.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yiye.
Every last part of it.	Ne fã biara a etwa to.
The child leaned against him.	Abofra no de ne ho too ne so.
I see a few problems with this.	Mihu ɔhaw kakraa bi wɔ eyi ho.
A little while ago.	Bere tiaa bi a atwam ni.
All things are not on all cars.	Nneɛma nyinaa nyɛ kar ahorow nyinaa so.
It’s far too dangerous.	Ɛyɛ asiane dodo koraa.
There was only one thing for him.	Ná ade biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ ma no.
For me, that was never a problem.	Wɔ me fam no, na ɛno nyɛ ɔhaw da.
This time, he is.	Saa bere yi de, ɔte saa.
The city square was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ kurow no abɔnten so ma.
You have to be out there.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wowɔ abɔnten hɔ.
I just don't know what it is.	Kɛkɛ a minnim nea ɛyɛ.
Who and where, how and why, when and what.	Hena ne baabi, ɔkwan bɛn so ne nea enti a, bere bɛn ne dɛn.
The most important thing is for the team to win.	Nea ɛho hia sen biara ne sɛ kuw no bedi nkonim.
He had to lie.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ odi atoro.
You should be happy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye.
So much for this.	Enti na pii wɔ eyi ho.
I was very impressed with him.	M’ani gyee ne ho yiye.
You told me that.	Wo na woka kyerɛɛ me saa.
Get closer to him.	Bɛn bɛn no.
A man with most of his head missing.	Ɔbarima bi a ne ti fã kɛse no ara nni hɔ.
Don’t let duration be any one thing.	Mma bere tenten nyɛ ade biako biara.
Maybe he’ll do the same.	Ebia ɔbɛyɛ saa ara.
Do not use any animal products.	Mfa mmoa a wɔde yɛ nneɛma biara nni dwuma.
That’s just the nature of things.	Ɛno ne nneɛma su ara kwa.
The whole system.	Nhyehyɛe no nyinaa.
This simple hairstyle makes you look and feel beautiful.	Saa ti nhwi a ɛnyɛ den yi ma wo ho yɛ fɛ na wo ho yɛ fɛ.
However, many people mean many cars.	Nanso, nnipa pii kyerɛ kar pii.
Where he wasn’t familiar with.	Baabi a na onnim no yiye.
But there are good things.	Nanso nneɛma pa wɔ hɔ.
As long as the story was there, it worked fine.	Bere tenten a na asɛm no wɔ hɔ no, na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
I’m very impressed with him.	M’ani gye ne ho kɛse.
I want their opinion, I want to incorporate their language into mine.	Mepɛ wɔn adwene, mepɛ sɛ mede wɔn kasa no ka me de ho.
We have enough of it.	Yɛwɔ nea ɛdɔɔso.
We do that.	Yɛyɛ saa.
The one he was on.	Nea na ɔwɔ so no.
He put us down.	Ɔde yɛn sii fam.
If this is not available, please be honest with me.	Sɛ eyi nyɛ nea wubetumi anya a, mesrɛ wo di me nokware.
I had to sleep.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meda.
That needs to go back.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno san kɔ.
The first movie started playing.	Sini a edi kan no fii ase bɔɔ.
Believe me, it really works.	Gye me di, ɛyɛ adwuma ankasa.
As dangerous to them as it is to me.	Asiane ma wɔn te sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu ma me no.
It seemed a bit creepy to me.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu kakra wɔ me fam.
He can run there with the best of them.	Obetumi ne wɔn mu a eye sen biara no atu mmirika akɔ hɔ.
And on the next and the next.	Na wɔ nea edi hɔ ne nea edi hɔ no so.
You need someone like me.	Wo hia obi a ɔte sɛ me.
I did indeed do that.	Meyɛɛ saa ampa.
But we do our best.	Nanso yɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara.
I know they will love this.	Minim sɛ wɔn ani begye eyi ho.
I will get one soon.	Me nsa bɛka bi nnansa yi ara.
That’s not very true right now.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware kɛse mprempren.
The child is a problem.	Abofra no yɛ ɔhaw.
It really didn’t matter.	Ná ɛnyɛ hwee ankasa.
We have meetings, we have parties.	Yɛwɔ nhyiam ahorow, yɛwɔ apontow ahorow.
It’s better in here than it is outside.	Ɛyɛ papa wɔ ha mu sen sɛ ɛwɔ abɔnten.
Legs behind forearms.	Nan wɔ anim nsa akyi.
It’s a really good one.	Ɛyɛ nea eye ankasa.
Take one of my hands and get rid of it.	Fa me nsa biako na yi fi hɔ.
What is your favorite food?	Aduan bɛn na w’ani gye ho paa?
Or maybe it wasn’t.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɛnte saa.
Maybe you’ll tell me.	Ebia wobɛka akyerɛ me.
And that’s his idea, you know.	Na ɛno ne n’adwene, wunim.
Not the way people think.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea nkurɔfo susuw nneɛma ho no.
It’s not our problem.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn haw no.
It’s so nice.	Ɛte saa.
I just want the best for the team.	Mepɛ nea eye ma kuw no ara kwa.
But he gives more for less.	Nanso ɔde pii ma de gye kakraa bi.
But he didn't have to worry.	Nanso na enhia sɛ ɔhaw ne ho.
It was cold.	Ná awɔw wom.
This will make it much easier to use.	Eyi bɛma ayɛ mmerɛw kɛse sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
Why is he doing this?	Dɛn nti na ɔreyɛ eyi?
Or so he thought.	Anaasɛ na osusuw saa.
You have to think about it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
He doesn't know why he says that.	Onnim nea enti a ɔka saa.
There was a lot going on.	Ná nneɛma pii rekɔ so.
This is certainly true in some cases.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ nokware wɔ nsɛm bi mu.
It had hours on it.	Ná ɛwɔ nnɔnhwerew pii wɔ so.
It shouldn’t be the case.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
There was no time for anything.	Ná bere nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ biribiara.
Kids are morning people.	Mmofra yɛ anɔpa nnipa.
He is always late.	Ɔka akyi bere nyinaa.
It was unforgettable.	Ná ɛnyɛ ade a obi werɛ betumi afi.
The summer was hot.	Ná awɔw bere no mu yɛ hyew.
I don’t really know what to say.	Minnim nea mɛka ankasa.
But something big is going on.	Nanso biribi kɛse bi rekɔ so.
He was impressed with this.	N’ani gyee eyi ho.
It was the same disaster.	Ná ɛyɛ asiane koro no ara.
Old cars drive to the front of the road.	Kar dedaw ahorow de kar kɔ kwan no anim.
But so was he.	Nanso na ɔno nso te saa ara.
Be careful!	Hwɛ yiye!
It still doesn’t.	Ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
I feel more drained than ever.	Mete nka sɛ me ho ayɛ me hyew sen bere biara.
I have good friends.	Mewɔ nnamfo pa.
I squinted at him.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ no.
Do you want a one bedroom or two bedroom apartment?	So wopɛ dan a ɛwɔ dan biako anaa dan abien?
The new setting was also beautiful.	Ná tebea foforo no nso yɛ fɛ.
But he does something.	Nanso ɔyɛ biribi so.
I love the dog.	M’ani gye ɔkraman no ho.
He seems to be a real person.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ onipa ankasa.
And it’s right here, right now.	Na ɛwɔ ha yi ara, seesei ara.
Children began to sing.	Mmofra fii ase too dwom.
But maybe that’s just me.	Nanso ebia ɛno ne me nkutoo.
Will come to me.	Bɛba me nkyɛn.
This is a new game for them.	Eyi yɛ agoru foforo ma wɔn.
See reviews, photos.	Hwɛ nsɛm a wɔka fa ho, mfonini ahorow.
What happened from here on out didn’t matter.	Nea esii fi ha rekɔ no na ɛnyɛ hwee.
I used only what was given to me.	Nea wɔde maa me nkutoo na mede dii dwuma.
He is a very passionate person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔpɛ nneɛma yiye.
His head hurt.	Ne ti yɛɛ no ​​yaw.
Even children knew where the big man lived.	Ná mmofra mpo nim baabi a ɔbarima kɛse no te.
Is that the a.	So ɛno ne a.
However, there was a window.	Nanso, na mfɛnsere bi wɔ hɔ.
However, this is not the case with man.	Nanso, eyi nte saa wɔ onipa fam.
After that, everything went well.	Ɛno akyi no, biribiara kɔɔ yiye.
That’s the system we have.	Ɛno ne nhyehyɛe a yɛwɔ no.
I saw the first phone.	Mihuu telefon a edi kan no.
It wasn’t like him.	Ná ɛnte sɛ ɔno.
What does he want from us?	Dɛn na ɔpɛ fi yɛn hɔ?
People do this every day.	Nkurɔfo yɛ eyi da biara da.
I touched his free hand.	Mede me nsa kaa ne nsa a ɔde ne ho no.
Before she could react, he was on top of her.	Ansa na ɔbɛyɛ ho biribi no, na ɔwɔ ne so.
We all make mistakes.	Yɛn nyinaa di mfomso.
No child would like that.	Abofra biara nni hɔ a n’ani begye saa asɛm no ho.
Remember, too, that	Kae nso sɛ .
In other words, you are not alone in this work.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo na woreyɛ adwuma yi.
I will get something from your kitchen.	Me nsa bɛka biribi afi wo dan mu.
What people hear is often forgotten.	Nea nkurɔfo te no, wɔn werɛ taa fi.
Something without words.	Biribi a nsɛm nnim.
It’s a terrible idea.	Ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ hu.
You and I, here, can do that.	Me ne wo, ha, yebetumi ayɛ saa.
He was good and handsome.	Ná ɔyɛ papa na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I know it very well.	Minim yiye.
But what pictures.	Nanso dɛn na mfonini ahorow.
I think that makes me weak.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ma meyɛ mmerɛw.
There was nothing we could do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na yebetumi ayɛ.
It wasn’t what it used to be.	Ná ɛnyɛ sɛnea na ɛte kan no.
There were no pairs.	Na baanu baanu biara nni hɔ.
Just go, you.	Kɔ kɛkɛ, wo.
Maybe next summer.	Ebia awɔw bere a edi hɔ no.
So, you always have to work on that.	Enti, ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa bere nyinaa no ho adwuma.
The scenery here was spectacular.	Ná nneɛma a ɛwɔ ha no yɛ nwonwa.
It seems more complicated in a way.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den sen saa wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
Same size, approx.	Ne kɛse koro no ara, bɛyɛ.
That’s just how it is, and it’s good.	Saa ara ne sɛnea ɛte, na ɛyɛ papa.
There are two types of items below.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ ase ha no yɛ ahorow abien.
The team likes you.	Kuw no ani gye wo ho.
I should like to say something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mepɛ sɛ meka biribi.
I wanted to believe he understood me.	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye di sɛ ɔte me ase.
This is what I do.	Eyi ne me yɛ.
If there is another problem, who knows.	Sɛ ɔhaw foforo ba a, hena na onim.
I'm so sorry for you.	Mepa wo kyɛw paa.
He gave them everything we had.	Ɔde nea yɛwɔ biara maa wɔn.
I don’t want to use people.	Mempɛ sɛ mede nnipa bedi dwuma.
Keep doing this.	Kɔ so yɛ eyi.
I’m still incredibly fond of it.	M’ani da so ara wɔ ho anigye a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
However, someone is knocking on his door.	Nanso, obi rebɔ ne pon mu.
I don’t think it is.	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
And there’s a lot of little here.	Na kakraa bi na ɛwɔ ha pii.
This will keep things more interesting for everyone.	Eyi bɛma nneɛma akɔ so ayɛ anigye kɛse ama obiara.
Or so everyone thought.	Anaasɛ saa na obiara susuwii.
Most of us are afraid to do it.	Yɛn mu dodow no ara suro sɛ yɛbɛyɛ.
These species appear to be complex species.	Ɛte sɛ nea saa mmoa ahorow yi yɛ mmoa ahorow a ɛyɛ den.
I think that one is too hard.	Misusuw sɛ saa biako no yɛ den dodo.
Text, a picture, and text again.	Nsɛm, mfonini bi, ne nsɛm bio.
One of those two has to give.	Ɛsɛ sɛ saa baanu no mu biako ma.
He is a smart boy.	Ɔyɛ abarimaa a ɔwɔ nyansa.
You need to put these people in jail.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode saa nkurɔfo yi to afiase.
But it works for us.	Nanso ɛyɛ adwuma ma yɛn.
I have to talk to him alone.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no nkutoo kasa.
Watch them do it.	Hwɛ wɔn sɛnea wɔyɛ.
In our city.	Wɔ yɛn kurow no mu.
So sorry, he says.	Enti kyɛw, ɔka sɛ.
But my mind was clear now.	Nanso na m’adwene mu da hɔ mprempren.
Your way closer to what you need to do.	Wo kwan no bɛn nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
He had made up his mind.	Ná wayɛ n’adwene.
It is not an easy task.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
It’s okay to use it.	Ɛnyɛ hwee sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
He was already late for work.	Ná aka akyi wɔ adwuma mu dedaw.
I hope that means we do both.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno kyerɛ sɛ yɛbɛyɛ abien no nyinaa.
The dog chases the dog.	Ɔkraman no taa ɔkraman no.
Hope is a beautiful thing.	Anidaso yɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
It was the same for me now.	Saa ara na na ɛte ma me mprempren.
It’s a good name.	Ɛyɛ din pa.
I had to do something.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi.
At least he thought so.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na osusuw sɛ ɛte saa.
I really want to do this.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi ankasa.
You just can’t do it.	Worentumi nyɛ ara kwa.
One child or another said this.	Abofra biako anaa foforo bi kaa saa asɛm yi.
People didn’t seem to care.	Ɛte sɛ nea na nkurɔfo mfa wɔn ho.
In a short period of time.	Wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
I gave him mine.	Mede me de maa no.
But it was nothing new.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ade foforo.
However, that conclusion does not follow.	Nanso, saa nsɛm a wɔde baa awiei no nni akyi.
And the night didn’t get to me right away.	Na anadwo no ankɔ me nkyɛn ntɛm ara.
He has a perfect plan.	Ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe a edi mũ.
I enjoyed it there.	M’ani gyee ho wɔ hɔ.
They were in danger.	Ná asiane agye wɔn adwene.
Tell me one.	Ka biako kyerɛ me.
We have been held back.	Wɔde yɛn ahyɛ akyi.
There is, or was, a man.	Ɔbarima bi wɔ hɔ, anaasɛ na ɔwɔ hɔ.
And an animal, too.	Na aboa bi nso.
For the first year or so, there was a lot of excitement.	Wɔ afe a edi kan anaa nea ɛte saa mu no, na anigye pii wɔ hɔ.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnte saa.
It shouldn’t surprise us.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn nwonwa.
In front of everyone.	Wɔ obiara anim.
Often, it is not.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛnte saa.
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
You have to give them that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode saa ma wɔn.
There’s nothing like spending time with friends.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ bere a wode bɛbɔ wo nnamfo.
It is, and yet it is not.	Ɛte saa, na nanso ɛnte saa.
That’s power, that’s power.	Ɛno ne tumi, ɛno ne tumi.
I am amazed at how well it works.	Sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma yiye no yɛ me nwonwa.
Few do that.	Kakraa na wɔyɛ saa.
They do a job.	Wɔyɛ adwuma bi.
My wife does this here.	Me yere yɛ eyi wɔ ha.
Be a man, child.	Yɛ ɔbarima, abofra.
Put them to work.	Fa wɔn kɔ adwuma mu.
Their children were not their own.	Ná wɔn mma nyɛ wɔn ankasa de.
That doesn’t mean it’s wrong to do them.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso sɛ wobɛyɛ wɔn.
There is certainly evil.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ bɔne wɔ hɔ.
However, there are problems with this approach.	Nanso, ɔhaw ahorow wɔ saa kwan yi ho.
Look closely at these pictures.	Hwɛ mfonini ahorow yi yiye.
Maybe stay in and work on here.	Ebia tra mu na yɛ adwuma wɔ ha ho.
A nice touch, indeed.	Nka a ɛyɛ fɛ, ampa.
In other words, he must be perfect.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ onipa a odi mũ.
But it’s not a bad idea.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwene bɔne.
The bed is very large.	Mpa no yɛ kɛse paa.
Use beautiful, beautiful materials.	Fa nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ a ɛyɛ fɛ di dwuma.
That’s why he liked her.	Ɛno nti na n’ani gyee ne ho.
It was never that hard.	Ná ɛnyɛ den saa da.
I had to take him inside and warm up.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede no kɔ mu na me ho yɛ hyew.
This house is secluded.	Saa ofie yi yɛ baabi a obiara nni hɔ.
At least my kids loved it.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na me mma ani gyee ho.
It’s too easy.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
And maybe you will.	Na ebia wobɛyɛ saa.
They were so beautiful.	Ná wɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
The matter became more serious.	Asɛm no mu yɛɛ den kɛse.
He also had some alcohol problems.	Ná ɔwɔ nsa ho haw ahorow bi nso.
Whatever it is.	Nea ɛyɛ biara.
Nothing matters now.	Biribiara ho nhia mprempren.
He introduced himself to us.	Ɔde ne ho too mu kyerɛɛ yɛn.
But one thing is certain.	Nanso ade biako na ɛyɛ nokware.
We have something in common in a way.	Yɛwɔ biribi a ɛyɛ pɛ wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
I just know that people are afraid.	Minim ara ne sɛ nkurɔfo suro.
They are, of course.	Wɔyɛ, ampa.
I wonder how his day went.	Misusuw sɛnea ne da no kɔɔ so no ho.
Again, it is not true that the person knows this.	Bio nso, ɛnyɛ nokware sɛ onipa no nim eyi.
That meant more to him than anything else at the time.	Ná ɛno kyerɛ pii ma no sen biribi foforo biara saa bere no.
He didn’t want trouble.	Ná ɔmpɛ ɔhaw.
He has made it a habit.	Ɔde ayɛ ne su.
We put a lot of our time into it.	Yɛde yɛn bere pii hyɛ mu.
I lowered my head.	Mede me ti sii fam.
We can both enjoy this now.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa betumi anya eyi mu anigye mprempren.
Animals can sense danger.	Mmoa tumi te asiane nka.
He sighed deeply.	Ɔde ne ho too fam kɛse.
It will work every time.	Ɛbɛyɛ adwuma bere biara.
She was as beautiful as her mother.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ te sɛ ne maame.
He shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
They were obviously a group.	Ɛda adi sɛ na wɔyɛ kuw bi.
So, everyone could do whatever they wanted.	Enti, na obiara betumi ayɛ nea ɔpɛ.
Not in this situation.	Ɛnyɛ saa tebea yi mu.
I know my character.	Minim me su.
The picture is not hopeless.	Mfonini no nyɛ nea anidaso nnim.
The man's head was bald.	Ná ɔbarima no ti ayɛ ti nhwi.
It has been used for a very long time.	Wɔde adi dwuma bere tenten paa.
Put yourself down.	Fa wo ho to fam.
And it was by his side.	Na ɛwɔ ne nkyɛn.
As simple as that sounds.	Sɛnea ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ nea ɛte no.
He was always a please and thank you person.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔka sɛ mesrɛ wo na meda wo ase bere nyinaa.
Probably better than, you know, anyone has ever done.	Ebia eye sen, wunim, obiara ayɛ pɛn.
Many animals hibernate.	Mmoa pii da awɔw bere mu.
This is our job.	Eyi ne yɛn adwuma.
In a year or two it might be.	Wɔ afe biako anaa abien mu no ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
You are out there just to be the best you can be.	Wowɔ abɔnten hɔ sɛ wobɛyɛ nea eye sen biara a wubetumi ara kwa.
Again, probably most of you.	Bio nso, ebia mo mu dodow no ara.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bɔne.
Good luck!	Ti pa!
Most of this year has been absolutely terrifying.	Afe yi fã kɛse no ara yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu koraa.
That’s when our problems started.	Ɛno na yɛn haw ahorow no fii ase.
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There are police inside.	Polisifo wɔ mu.
And a gun, too.	Na tuo nso.
The dog has disguised itself as a dog.	Ɔkraman no ayɛ ne ho sɛ ɔkraman.
I didn’t have time for that.	Ná minni bere mma ɛno.
I want you to be with me.	Mepɛ sɛ woka me ho.
He did so.	Ɔyɛɛ saa.
Tom is not as busy as last year.	Tom nni adagyew te sɛ afe a etwaam no.
I think it’s a given.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ ade a wɔde ama.
It’s a big deal.	Ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse.
The same is not how it works.	Saa ara na ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma.
That task is not easy.	Saa adwuma no nyɛ mmerɛw.
Maybe my plan was working after all.	Ebia na me nhyehyɛe no reyɛ adwuma wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
And if there were three it seemed like enough.	Na sɛ abiɛsa wɔ hɔ a na ɛte sɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
He plays a lot of games.	Ɔyɛ agoru ahorow pii.
You could have come home.	Anka wubetumi aba fie.
The household chores are difficult.	Ofie nnwuma no yɛ den.
I am always with her kids.	Me ne ne mma no wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
I love them both.	M’ani gye wɔn baanu nyinaa ho.
They rely on something else.	Wɔde wɔn ho to ade foforo bi so.
But I can’t find anything about it.	Nanso me ntumi nnya biribiara mfa ho.
This is a bad idea.	Eyi yɛ adwene bɔne.
Look at him.	Hwɛ no.
This idea may bother you.	Ebia saa adwene yi haw wo.
There had never been such a beast.	Ná aboa a ɔte saa biara nni hɔ da.
Ha and ha.	Ha ne ha.
It was a terrible accident.	Ná ɛyɛ akwanhyia a ɛyɛ hu.
It was too much for me.	Ná ɛdɔɔso dodo ma me.
They were very interested in the man's face.	Ná wɔn ani gye ɔbarima no anim ho kɛse.
And do it right.	Na yɛ no yiye.
You.	Wo.
But he did it.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ saa.
Look, everybody, here.	Hwɛ, obiara, wɔ ha.
Many thought he shouldn’t.	Nnipa pii susuwii sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Chill!	Gye w'ani!
But one thing.	Nanso ade biako.
I wish you all the best.	Mepɛ mo nyinaa yiye.
However, the house was gone.	Nanso, na ofie no nni hɔ bio.
There was something he could glimpse.	Ná biribi wɔ hɔ a na obetumi ahu no kakra.
It’s a language.	Ɛyɛ kasa.
This house is old.	Saa ofie yi ayɛ dedaw.
So much information.	Nsɛm pii saa.
There wasn’t much else.	Ná nneɛma foforo pii nni hɔ.
But there was more.	Nanso na pii wɔ hɔ.
But we can deal with this.	Nanso yebetumi adi eyi ho dwuma.
He didn't have to do that.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
His touch makes my hands go numb.	Ne nsa a ɔde ka no no ma me nsa yɛ mmerɛw.
However, much remains to be done.	Nanso, pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He almost seems a little excited about it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye kakra wɔ ho.
Only those words.	Saa nsɛm no nkutoo.
Maybe look there.	Ebia hwɛ hɔ.
There is a plan.	Nhyehyɛe bi wɔ hɔ.
I have a.	Mewɔ a.
No one should assume anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara fa no sɛ biribiara.
Maybe their music.	Ebia wɔn nnwom.
The same is true in the workplace.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ adwumam.
I was very impressed with him.	M’ani gyee ne ho yiye.
I know he did that.	Minim sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
He is worried about himself.	Ɔhaw ne ho.
He hoped no one else heard about this.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ obi foforo nte eyi ho asɛm.
I need to find myself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu me ho.
But the phone comes first.	Nanso telefon di kan.
He wanted her very much.	Ná ɔpɛ no kɛse.
He will be very helpful to me.	Ɔbɛboa me paa.
Tell me who did this.	Ka nea ɔyɛɛ eyi kyerɛ me.
I knew better than that.	Ná minim yiye sen saa.
It’s a big deal, really, and it needs to be done.	Ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse, ampa, na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
This is one of those songs.	Eyi yɛ saa nnwom no mu biako.
He has nothing to tell her.	Onni biribiara a ɔbɛka akyerɛ no.
They can solve most problems on their own.	Wɔn ankasa betumi adi ɔhaw dodow no ara ho dwuma.
You’ve been working on it for a long time.	Woayɛ ho adwuma akyɛ.
You will, boy.	Wobɛyɛ, abarimaa.
I hope this holds true for you as well.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ eyi bɛyɛ nokware ama wo nso.
That was a surprise.	Ná ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
Rumor has it that the system will do the same.	Asɛm bi ka sɛ nhyehyɛe no nso bɛyɛ saa ara.
It’s faster than anything else.	Ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm sen biribi foforo biara.
It is a dangerous job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a asiane wom.
It was such a wonderful day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye saa.
It was a control, for both of us.	Na ɛyɛ ade a wɔde di so, ma yɛn baanu nyinaa.
Surely, you want to be part of it, so	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, wopɛ sɛ woka ho, enti .
We bring you in.	Yɛde wo ba.
So much for being best friends.	Enti pii sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo paa.
And he knew it, too.	Na ɔno nso nim.
He knew, he knew and everyone knew they were a team.	Na onim, na onim na obiara nim sɛ wɔyɛ kuw.
All of this is very important to me.	Eyi nyinaa ho hia me yiye.
That it certainly isn’t.	Sɛ akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnte saa.
He relies on it.	Ɔde ne ho to so.
Everything seems to be about the moment.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara fa mprempren ara ho.
It will be this.	Ɛbɛyɛ eyi.
That’s all I have to say.	Ɛno nkutoo ne me nsɛm.
All kinds of people tend to come through.	Nnipa ahorow nyinaa taa fa mu ba.
I loved racing cars.	Ná m’ani gye kar a wɔde tu mmirika ho.
We are in trouble.	Yɛwɔ ɔhaw mu.
I can’t even imagine it.	Mintumi nsusuw ho mpo.
At least you know there will be sex for you.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wunim sɛ nna bɛba ama wo.
But the night is too clear.	Nanso anadwo no mu da hɔ dodo.
It was a cold day.	Ná awɔw da no.
You are so lucky to have so many friends.	Wowɔ anigye kɛse sɛ wowɔ nnamfo pii saa.
At some point in time.	Wɔ bere bi mu.
The industry was in decline.	Ná nnwuma no rekɔ fam.
This is very important.	Eyi ho hia yiye.
This is important for three reasons.	Nneɛma abiɛsa nti na eyi ho hia.
This time of year.	Saa bere yi wɔ afe no mu.
It doesn’t seem like much of a problem.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
Unless someone comes later.	Gye sɛ obi bɛba akyiri yi.
She often forgets to do household chores.	Mpɛn pii no, ne werɛ fi sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ofie nnwuma.
And it wasn’t even a man.	Na ɛnyɛ ɔbarima mpo.
It was very impressive.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
But none of these things make him stronger.	Nanso saa nneɛma yi mu biara mma ne ho yɛ den.
Which we have to do, in the end.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ, wɔ awiei no.
The stories are very interesting.	Nsɛm no yɛ anigye kɛse.
It’s as simple as that.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ ɛno.
The bed was very comfortable.	Ná mpa no yɛ fɛ yiye.
He doesn’t have to talk to you every day.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔne wo kasa da biara da.
Two points are most important.	Nsɛm abien na ɛho hia sen biara.
That would have created an issue.	Anka ɛno bɛma asɛm bi aba.
His friends accept him as he is.	Ne nnamfo gye no tom sɛnea ɔyɛ no.
I think it was supposed to be the next day.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ da a edi hɔ no.
I really like the idea.	M’ani gye adwene no ho ankasa.
I was named there.	Wɔde me din too hɔ wɔ hɔ.
He wasn’t happy there.	Ná n’ani nnye wɔ hɔ.
He was one of the two.	Ná ɔyɛ nnipa baanu no mu biako.
I found something in the letter.	Mihuu biribi wɔ krataa no mu.
That’s for everyone else to decide.	Ɛno yɛ nea obiara a aka no besi ho gyinae.
The idea is that this.	Adwene no ne sɛ eyi.
He was one of two when he first joined.	Ná ɔyɛ nnipa baanu no mu biako bere a edi kan a ɔde ne ho bɔɔ mu no.
I am.	Meyɛ.
Everyone else did those things.	Obiara a aka no yɛɛ saa nneɛma no.
I know how to do that.	Minim sɛnea wɔyɛ saa.
He didn't seem to be.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔnyɛ saa.
I put a new door on top of this door.	Mede ɔpon foforo bi too ɔpon yi so.
This does not make my mother happy.	Eyi mma me maame ani nnye.
And here he was.	Na ha na na ɔwɔ.
Like me, he wants it.	Te sɛ me no, ɔno nso pɛ.
This happened to me just now.	Eyi too me mprempren ara.
That’s the point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no.
As long as you want or.	Bere tenten a wopɛ anaa.
He knew he was very good at what he did.	Ná onim sɛ na ne ho akokwaw yiye wɔ nea ɔyɛ no mu.
I was really surprised by the quality of this dish.	Sɛnea aduan yi yɛ papa no maa me ho dwiriw me ankasa.
A lot of time had passed.	Ná bere pii atwam.
I want more time.	Mepɛ bere pii.
This time it's you know.	Saa bere yi a ɛyɛ wo nim.
This project is not cheap.	Saa adwuma yi nyɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den.
Many people put a lot of hope into this story.	Nnipa pii de anidaso pii hyɛ saa asɛm yi mu.
That is not unique to him.	Ɛno nyɛ ne nkutoo de.
You should have known me better.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu me yiye.
I wonder why that is.	Misusuw nea enti a ɛte saa no ho.
There really are wonderful people out there.	Nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa wɔ hɔ ampa wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
This was not the end of everything.	Ná eyi nyɛ biribiara awiei.
But it is important.	Nanso ɛho hia.
We are here to stay.	Yɛwɔ ha.
But he obeys to the last.	Nanso odi so kosi nea etwa to.
Thank you for it.	Meda wo ase wɔ ho.
I knew what he looked like.	Ná minim sɛnea ɔte.
The seeds have really been knocked down.	Wɔde aba no abɔ fam ankasa.
At least to him, it did matter.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ ne fam no, na ɛho hia no ampa.
A man's dog.	Ɔbarima bi kraman.
He loved his hands.	Ná n’ani gye ne nsa ho.
The gun doesn’t go well.	Tuo no nkɔ yiye.
I thought it was just me.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
And if it doesn’t, it doesn’t.	Na sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛnte saa.
That could happen again.	Ɛno betumi aba bio.
I can never do that.	Mintumi nyɛ saa da.
What a terrible situation.	Tebea a ɛyɛ hu bɛn ara ni.
I was late for classes.	Ná meka akyi wɔ adesua mu.
He slipped his eyes out.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ hɔ.
That was too intense.	Ná ɛno mu yɛ den dodo.
It was a really bad situation.	Ná ɛyɛ tebea bɔne ankasa.
Tell me about your day.	Ka wo da no ho asɛm kyerɛ me.
At least you believe that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wugye di saa.
It’s not like I’m sleeping.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ meda.
The figure is.	Mfonini no.
My kids have been friends with them for years.	Me mma ayɛ wɔn nnamfo mfe pii ni.
It was nighttime.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo.
I just wanted my baby.	Ná mepɛ me ba no ara kwa.
That’s pretty much it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno ne no.
He doesn’t like that.	N’ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
He inserts a picture into the paper.	Ɔde mfonini bi hyɛ krataa no mu.
I’m very pleased with the results.	M’ani gye nea afi mu aba no ho yiye.
It was a long and difficult project.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma tenten a ɛyɛ den.
One was very good, the other disastrous.	Ná biako yɛ papa yiye, na biako nso yɛ asiane.
I’m so happy to be here.	M’ani agye yiye sɛ mewɔ ha.
That could be our big end.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ yɛn awiei kɛse.
Yesterday was that day.	Nnɛra ne saa da no.
But it didn’t show a little bit.	Nanso ankyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ kakra.
Stay in bed all day.	Tra mpa so da mũ nyinaa.
This was an interesting thing.	Ná eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye.
I need to see where that road takes me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu baabi a saa kwan no de me kɔ.
It’s easy, man.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw, ɔbarima.
Like your mother.	Te sɛ wo maame.
That would come later.	Ná ɛno bɛba akyiri yi.
There is almost no water.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nsu biara nni hɔ.
One of my friends is in prison.	Me nnamfo no mu biako da afiase.
You are a man, and there is nothing wrong with that.	Woyɛ ɔbarima, na mfomso biara nni ho.
Those days are long gone.	Saa nna no atwam akyɛ.
Anything can be true.	Biribiara betumi ayɛ nokware.
I have to take care of myself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ me ho yiye.
He had the letter with him.	Ná ɔwɔ krataa no ka ne ho.
There are so many things to do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
There is a lot of variety here.	Nneɛma ahorow pii wɔ ha.
I don’t like how it looks.	M’ani nnye sɛnea ɛte no ho.
So just before the end.	Enti bere tiaa bi ansa na awiei no aba.
Just give it to me.	Ma me kɛkɛ.
The house is in poor condition.	Ofie no tebea nyɛ papa.
Use it only when necessary.	Fa di dwuma bere a ɛho hia nkutoo.
He was a very handsome man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
It might be his best film yet.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ sini a eye sen biara a wayɛ de besi nnɛ.
There is nothing wrong.	Biribiara bɔne biara nni hɔ.
But even so.	Nanso saa mpo no.
It was him.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔno.
Even his wife can’t.	Ne yere mpo ntumi nyɛ saa.
It’s not that we’re going to do it.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ yɛbɛyɛ.
You may already know this and you may not.	Ebia wunim eyi dedaw na ebia wunnim.
Girl goes home.	Abeawa kɔ fie.
And this is the case here.	Na eyi te saa wɔ ha.
I'm a little better than them.	Meyɛ papa sen wɔn kakra.
And even then.	Na saa bere no mpo.
All those years he was gone.	Saa mfe no nyinaa na na onni hɔ.
You can solve the problem quickly and easily.	Wubetumi adi ɔhaw no ho dwuma ntɛm na ɛnyɛ den.
I should have stayed with you.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo tra.
Yours will likely be the same or similar to mine.	Ɛda adi sɛ wo de no bɛyɛ sɛ me de no ara pɛ anaasɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛte no ara.
This solves that issue.	Eyi di saa asɛm no ho dwuma.
And so the days went quickly.	Na saa na nna no kɔɔ so ntɛmntɛm.
It’s the same time as this.	Ɛyɛ bere koro no ara a wɔde yɛ eyi.
But that’s not surprising.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ nwonwa.
Please, go inside.	Mesrɛ wo, kɔ mu.
But other than that, the room was empty.	Nanso sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, na hwee nni dan no mu.
The problem was simpler than it looked.	Ná ɔhaw no yɛ mmerɛw sen sɛnea na ɛte no.
However, you know the only reason it exists.	Nanso, wunim ade biako pɛ a enti ɛwɔ hɔ ne sɛ.
One is today.	Biako ne nnɛ.
They are not the problem.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn na wɔyɛ ɔhaw no.
I find all of that unremarkable.	Mihu sɛ saa nneɛma no nyinaa nyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It wasn’t fun.	Ná ɛnyɛ anigye.
Maybe it will be.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I don’t really think so.	Minsusuw saa ankasa.
The school paper asked me.	Sukuu krataa no bisaa me sɛ.
But not everyone is so lucky.	Nanso ɛnyɛ obiara na ɔwɔ anigye saa.
I want it bad enough to be good.	Mepɛ bɔne kɛse sɛ ɛbɛyɛ papa.
And so that stayed with me.	Na enti ɛno traa me mu.
I think it’s a very important part of being human.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ onipa a obi bɛyɛ no fã a ɛho hia yiye.
Perhaps yours does too.	Ebia wo de no nso yɛ saa.
As if anything was possible.	Te sɛ nea na biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye.
You had to be surprised.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo nwonwa.
A job, a job.	Adwuma bi, adwuma bi.
Every animal can talk.	Aboa biara tumi kasa.
I feel numb.	Mete nka sɛ me ho ayɛ me hyew.
The party was powerless.	Ná apontow no nni tumi.
It works, too.	Ɛyɛ adwuma nso.
It’s already morning.	Ɛyɛ anɔpa dedaw.
There were no shoes.	Na mpaboa biara nni hɔ.
At least not to him.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ no.
And you are me.	Na woyɛ me.
He would have loved this house.	Anka n’ani begye ofie yi ho.
Not everyone can have everything they want.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na obetumi anya biribiara a ɔpɛ.
Maybe, just maybe, this could work.	Ebia, ebia kɛkɛ, eyi betumi ayɛ adwuma.
You have to tell us something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka biribi kyerɛ yɛn.
Their two cars collided.	Wɔn kar abien no bɔɔ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
Every dog ​​has its day.	Ɔkraman biara wɔ ne da.
He didn't have what was on the list.	Ná onni nea ɛwɔ din no mu no.
I don’t even know if there’s anything we can do for them.	Minnim mpo sɛ ebia biribi wɔ hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ wɔn anaa.
Entire.	Ne nyinaa.
You have to tell me the truth.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka nokware no kyerɛ me.
It was a good thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade pa.
It’s a long time ago.	Ɛyɛ bere tenten a atwam.
Check the progress of the project.	Hwɛ sɛnea adwuma no rekɔ so no.
I only saw them by accident.	Mihuu wɔn wɔ akwanhyia mu nkutoo.
They weren’t all that wrong then.	Saa bere no na wɔn nyinaa nyɛ mfomso saa.
Do you this thing.	Yɛ wo saa ade yi.
Many species are endangered.	Mmoa ahorow pii wɔ asiane mu.
He would be relieved.	Ná ne ho bɛtɔ no.
For many reasons.	Nneɛma pii nti.
He was very good at it.	Na ɔyɛ obi a ne ho akokwaw yiye wɔ mu.
I’m there, too.	Me nso mewɔ hɔ.
As if it were an opportunity.	Te sɛ nea ɛyɛ hokwan bi.
Look at the school schedule.	Hwɛ sukuu nhyehyɛe no.
He was doing the same thing.	Ná ɔno nso yɛ saa.
Please, please, please stay with me.	Mesrɛ wo, mesrɛ wo, mesrɛ wo, tra me nkyɛn.
Textbook, one might say.	Adesua nhoma, obi betumi aka.
The system did not work well.	Nhyehyɛe no antumi anyɛ adwuma yiye.
But his hands were already starting to ache.	Nanso na ne nsa afi ase reyɛ ayɛ no yaw dedaw.
He is fast and powerful.	Ɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm na ɔwɔ tumi kɛse.
He didn’t like that.	Ná n’ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
You must not forget.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wo werɛ fi.
Happy with me.	Anigye ne me.
Home design images, for you.	Ofie mu nhyehyɛe mfonini ahorow, ma wo.
She was actually very nice.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
By now, you know that’s only partially true.	Seesei de, wunim sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware fã bi pɛ.
This process is often time-consuming.	Saa adwuma yi taa gye bere pii.
But think of them we should.	Nanso susuw wɔn ho sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
A great deal of work to do in it.	Adwuma kɛse a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ mu.
I’m glad you have money.	M’ani agye sɛ wowɔ sika.
I couldn’t think without it.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, na mintumi nsusuw nneɛma ho.
Winter is terrible and very cold.	Awɔw bere yɛ hu na awɔw wom kɛse.
I know that’s possible.	Minim sɛ ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye.
He was an introvert.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu.
Neither he nor the man saw the snake.	Ɔno anaa ɔbarima no anhu ɔwɔ no.
Children will love it.	Mmofra ani begye ho.
Don’t argue.	Nnye akyinnye.
Each film was about two hours long.	Ná sini biara tenten bɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abien.
It’s that much easier.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse saa.
Tell us what you liked or didn’t like.	Ka nea w’ani gyee ho anaa nea w’ani nnye ho kyerɛ yɛn.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
They are human beings just like you.	Wɔyɛ nnipa te sɛ wo ara pɛ.
Many of the animals are now endangered.	Mprempren mmoa no pii wɔ asiane mu.
Put the things down.	Fa nneɛma no to fam.
Food comes very quickly.	Aduan ba ntɛmntɛm yiye.
These shoes are very comfortable.	Saa mpaboa yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He had a mouth to feed home.	Ná ɔwɔ ano a ɔde bɛma aduan akɔ fie.
We loved every single picture we received.	Yɛn ani gyee mfonini biako biara a yɛn nsa kaa ho.
Many people were really afraid of him.	Ná nnipa pii suro no ankasa.
But, even here.	Nanso, ha mpo.
Moreover, many cases were simplified.	Bio nso, wɔde nsɛm pii yɛɛ mmerɛw.
This opportunity is not absolute.	Saa hokwan yi nyɛ nea edi mũ.
Do nothing, and it grows for years.	Mma nyɛ hwee, na ɛyɛ kɛse mfe pii.
This is not good enough.	Eyi nyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
It’s absolutely amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
There was no idea.	Ná adwene biara nni hɔ.
Your mother is included.	Wo maame ka ho.
The size, the length.	Ne kɛse, ne tenten.
Something was very wrong, he knew that without knowing why.	Na biribi anyɛ yiye koraa, na onim saa a onnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
I still feel a little numb.	Meda so ara te nka sɛ me ho ayɛ me yaw kakra.
This accomplishes two things.	Eyi ma nneɛma abien bi ba mu.
It feels really strong.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ den ankasa.
It was too much for him.	Ná ɛdɔɔso dodo ma no.
That will be important in the very next game.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nea ɛho hia wɔ agoru a edi hɔ koraa no mu.
Not good for that.	Ɛnyɛ papa mma ɛno.
Was it a slow motion? 	So na ɛte saa?
Now we have added a feature.	Seesei yɛde ade bi aka ho.
There are three things we can do with our money.	Nneɛma abiɛsa na yebetumi de yɛn sika ayɛ.
However, it doesn’t matter.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ hwee.
Try to be good.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wobɛyɛ papa.
But the kids had gone too far.	Nanso na mmofra no akɔ akyiri dodo.
And she was working for him.	Na na ɔno nso reyɛ adwuma ama no.
That is not how it should be.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
Go somewhere challenging and exciting.	Kɔ baabi a ɛyɛ den na ɛyɛ anigye.
It was a bad thing to do.	Ná ɛyɛ ade bɔne a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I don’t have to say anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meka biribiara.
Like just that time ago.	Te sɛ saa bere no ara pɛ a atwam no.
I was head and shoulders level with him.	Ná me ti ne ne nan yɛ pɛ.
I can’t see that.	Mintumi nhu saa.
There were no final words.	Ná nsɛm a etwa to biara nni hɔ.
But there is something else.	Nanso biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
Let’s enjoy this moment.	Momma yɛn ani nnye saa bere yi ho.
I feel very involved.	Mete nka sɛ mede me ho ahyɛ mu kɛse.
And here is what this textbook says.	Na nea adesua nhoma yi ka ni.
People knew him.	Ná nkurɔfo nim no.
You were always with that girl.	Na wo ne saa abeawa no wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
He had no problems.	Ná onni ɔhaw biara.
Such a picture.	Mfonini a ɛte saa.
I totally understand why.	Mete nea enti a ɛte saa no ase koraa.
Everyone eats this as a meal at home.	Obiara di eyi sɛ aduan wɔ fie.
Everyone is interested in him.	Obiara ani gye ne ho.
A beautiful job!	Adwuma a ɛyɛ fɛ!
In this city.	Wɔ saa kurow yi mu.
I didn’t even have a home.	Ná minni fie mpo.
Keep an eye on them, if you will.	Ma w’ani nna hɔ mma wɔn, sɛ wopɛ a.
The big man thought for a moment.	Ɔbarima kɛse no susuw ho kakra.
However, you don’t know that.	Nanso, wunnim saa.
Or sleepovers.	Anaasɛ nna a wɔde da.
It’s not you either.	Ɛnyɛ wo nso.
It was a little hard for them, but they loved it.	Ná ɛyɛ den kakra ma wɔn, nanso na wɔn ani gye ho.
Typically, shoes are worn, if dangerous.	Mpɛn pii no, wɔde mpaboa hyɛ, sɛ ɛyɛ hu a.
I know we can.	Minim sɛ yebetumi.
He did the same with the rest of their stuff.	Ɔno nso yɛɛ wɔn nneɛma a aka no saa ara.
In a similar way.	Wɔ ɔkwan a ɛte saa ara so.
And yet it isn’t, somehow.	Na nanso ɛnte saa, ɔkwan bi so.
Best served at room temperature.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wɔde bɛma wɔ dan mu hyew mu.
We have a lot of lessons.	Yɛwɔ adesua pii.
No one was supposed to tell me anything.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara ka biribiara kyerɛ me.
I have two reasons.	Mewɔ nneɛma abien nti.
Likewise,	Saa ara na,
And after taking it home.	Na bere a wɔde akɔ fie akyi.
I have a picture of my dad, but that’s it.	Mewɔ me papa mfonini, nanso ɛno ara ne no.
There is too much information.	Nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ dodo.
Or maybe it does.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛyɛ saa.
I do live with them.	Mete wɔn nkyɛn ampa.
What it might be.	Nea ebia ɛyɛ.
Put those books away.	Fa saa nhoma ahorow no to hɔ.
This is very disturbing to him.	Eyi haw no kɛse.
His wife and children were outside.	Ná ne yere ne ne mma no wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
Maybe it was someone who didn’t like me.	Ebia ɛyɛ obi a na n’ani nnye me ho.
I did the front one.	Meyɛɛ nea ɛwɔ anim no.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Minnim nea mɛyɛ, ampa.
But that was not the way things had been.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ saa na na nneɛma akɔ so.
But it’s out there.	Nanso ɛwɔ abɔnten hɔ.
I do think about it.	Misusuw ho ampa.
There were no cars, and the road was beautiful.	Ná kar biara nni hɔ, na na ɔkwan no yɛ fɛ yiye.
I think what they say is true.	Misusuw sɛ nea wɔka no yɛ nokware.
You are real and you are here with me.	Woyɛ obi ankasa na wo ne me wɔ ha.
You must not forget that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wo werɛ fi saa asɛm no.
He seems pretty happy now.	Ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye yiye mprempren.
That way, your plan can help someone else.	Saa kwan no so no, wo nhyehyɛe no betumi aboa obi foforo.
He puts his hand in it.	Ɔde ne nsa hyɛ mu.
It’s their opinion.	Ɛyɛ wɔn adwene.
His best days were a few years away.	Ná aka mfe kakraa bi na aka ne nna a eye sen biara.
He added the same.	Ɔde kaa ho.
Which you had done right the first time.	Nea na woayɛ no yiye bere a edi kan no.
The school is too crowded.	Sukuu no mu ayɛ ma dodo.
I have a lot of things to do.	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
He did the same with the other leg.	Ɔyɛɛ saa ara wɔ nan foforo no ho.
Everyone seems to rely on him.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara de ne ho to ne so.
Most people only have one.	Nnipa dodow no ara wɔ biako pɛ.
These shoes are always hydrating.	Saa mpaboa yi ma nsu kɔ mu bere nyinaa.
The children were there.	Ná mmofra no wɔ hɔ.
He has what.	Ɔwɔ nea.
I saw something today.	Mihuu biribi nnɛ.
I heard about it.	Metee ho asɛm.
The water is of good quality.	Nsu no yɛ nea ɛyɛ papa.
Anything you can find.	Biribiara a wubetumi anya.
It wasn’t pretty.	Ná ɛnyɛ fɛ.
At least it seems that way.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
Even they can’t understand.	Wɔn mpo ntumi nte ase.
Or every night, at least.	Anaasɛ anadwo biara, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
I can’t think of any music.	Mintumi nsusuw nnwom biara ho.
A girl and a boy.	Abeawa ne abarimaa bi.
Make it about him.	Yɛ no fa ne ho.
But this is often not the case.	Nanso eyi taa nyɛ saa.
I know he enjoyed it.	Minim sɛ n’ani gyee ho.
But it still needed work.	Nanso na ɛda so ara hia adwuma.
He had no reason to be jealous.	Ná onni biribiara a enti ɛsɛ sɛ n’ani bere.
We were very impressed with him.	Yɛn ani gyee ne ho paa.
That’s part of it.	Ɛno yɛ ne fã.
Everyone, except me.	Obiara, gye me nkutoo.
I like that person.	M’ani gye saa onipa no ho.
I really think this is going somewhere.	Misusuw ankasa sɛ eyi rekɔ baabi.
It’s not the case.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte.
The days are warming now.	Nna no reyɛ hyew mprempren.
I can spend my time with a lot better people than you.	Metumi ne nnipa pii a wɔyɛ papa sen wo adi me bere.
Many still do so.	Pii da so ara yɛ saa.
The memories of the past are gone.	Nneɛma a wɔde kae nneɛma a atwam no nni hɔ bio.
His eyes were hard and strong.	Ná n’ani a ɛyɛ den na ɛyɛ den.
The dog is a delicate animal.	Ɔkraman yɛ aboa a ne ho yɛ mmerɛw.
How soon can we get started?	Yɛbɛyɛ ntɛm ahe na yebetumi afi ase?
You just have to do both.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ abien no nyinaa ara kwa.
That is very important to us.	Ɛno ho hia yɛn paa.
It was full on it.	Ná ɛyɛ ma wɔ so.
I can’t see it.	Mintumi nhu.
So let me do the same.	Enti ma menyɛ saa ara.
Do you have a plan.	So wowɔ nhyehyɛe bi.
I don’t like it very much.	M’ani nnye ho kɛse.
But it’s not perfect.	Nanso ɛnyɛ pɛ.
It doesn’t even have to be important.	Ɛho nhia mpo sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛho hia.
Those people are real people.	Saa nkurɔfo no yɛ nnipa ankasa.
But she was a good girl.	Nanso na ɔyɛ abeawa pa.
You’ve already done a lot of work today.	Woayɛ adwuma pii dedaw nnɛ.
There is nothing in front of us.	Biribiara nni yɛn anim.
I never should have done that.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa da.
The children walked to school.	Mmofra no nantew kɔɔ sukuu.
But when it becomes a reality is another matter entirely.	Nanso bere a ɛbɛyɛ nokware no yɛ asɛm foforo koraa.
He told his mother.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne maame.
He had forgotten how cold it was!	Ná ne werɛ afi sɛnea na awɔw wom no!
Two days had passed, by the way.	Ná nna abien atwam, ɔkwan bi so.
It’s a simple task.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛnyɛ den.
They bring each other.	Wɔde wɔn ho wɔn ho ba.
I certainly did.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ meyɛɛ saa.
That day.	Saa da no.
I've got a terrible headache.	Me ho ayɛ me ti a ɛyɛ hu.
But that was a long time ago.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
But most are just fantastic.	Nanso dodow no ara yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
This has been the problem for a long time.	Eyi ayɛ ɔhaw no bere tenten ni.
These features will be introduced in the next section.	Wɔde saa nneɛma yi bɛba wɔ nea edi hɔ no mu.
These classes will continue.	Saa adesua ahorow yi bɛkɔ so.
It’s something you have.	Ɛyɛ biribi a wowɔ.
I never knew anyone like you.	Minnim obiara te sɛ wo da.
Keep your head down.	Ma wo ti nkɔ fam.
It was in his gaze.	Na ɛwɔ n’ani a ɔde hwɛ ade no mu.
They were the only ones working.	Ná wɔn nkutoo na wɔyɛ adwuma.
You can lift your legs, if you like.	Wubetumi ama wo nan so, sɛ wopɛ a.
I wanted to believe it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye di.
At least it sounds awesome to say the least.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu sɛ wobɛka.
That’s what it is.	Ɛno ne nea.
The look in his eyes .	Hwɛ a ɛwɔ n’ani so no .
Don’t say that now.	Nka saa seesei.
It is on every floor.	Ɛwɔ fam biara.
Your music is beautiful.	Wo nnwom yɛ fɛ.
Or maybe he’ll just surrender.	Anaasɛ ebia ɔde ne ho bɛma kɛkɛ.
And I didn’t mean you.	Na ɛnyɛ wo na na mepɛ sɛ meka.
The road was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ ɔkwan no so ma.
He's only here for a month.	Ɔwɔ ha ɔsram biako pɛ.
I was going to be me.	Ná mekɔ so ayɛ me.
Without any hands.	A nsa biara nni hɔ.
He slipped out of town.	Ɔde ne ho fii kurow no mu.
It’s true, it’s true.	Ɛyɛ nokware, ɛyɛ nokware.
It sounds terrible.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
His people didn’t.	Ne nkurɔfo anyɛ saa.
Like in the book.	Te sɛ nea ɛwɔ nhoma no mu no.
No picture, no name for you.	Mfonini biara nni hɔ, din biara nni hɔ ma wo.
He got involved in the work.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ adwuma mu.
Remember the name.	Kae din no.
It takes precedence over almost anything else.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ edi kan sen biribi foforo biara.
We will do as little as possible.	Yɛbɛyɛ kakraa bi sɛnea yebetumi.
There was no one here.	Na obiara nni ha.
I felt like	Metee nka sɛ .
It seems to work.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma.
He wanted nothing to do with me.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔne me bɛyɛ hwee.
At least that’s how his mind sees it.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na n’adwene hu no.
I have some food for you.	Mewɔ aduan bi ma wo.
However, it gets too hot very quickly.	Nanso, ɛyɛ hyew dodo ntɛmntɛm.
You have a lot of fun.	Wowɔ anigye kɛse.
Man is in his own.	Onipa wɔ ne de mu.
I absolutely had to include this one.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede eyi ka ho koraa.
This man is so tall.	Saa ɔbarima yi tenten saa.
With this you can get the whole story.	Wode eyi betumi anya asɛm no nyinaa.
This applies to our system as well.	Eyi fa yɛn nhyehyɛe no nso ho.
That year, too.	Saa afe no nso.
Here is someone who didn’t want him.	Obi a na ɔmpɛ no wɔ ha.
You shouldn’t get involved in these things.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ saa nneɛma yi mu.
There was a lot going on.	Ná nneɛma pii rekɔ so.
Of the three, this is my favorite.	Wɔ abiɛsa no mu no, eyi ne nea m’ani gye ho paa.
Neither approach is without its drawbacks, however.	Nanso, ɔkwan abien no mu biara nni hɔ a ɔhaw biara nni ho.
You don’t have to do this.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi.
I think it’s awesome.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ hu.
Which might be just as good.	Nea ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa saa ara.
He did it very well	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​yiye koraa .
I did know it.	Ná minim ampa.
So was his team.	Saa ara na na ne kuw no nso te.
Try to see how you like it.	Bɔ mmɔden hwɛ sɛnea w’ani gye ho.
I look at my shoes.	Mehwɛ me mpaboa.
You don’t want him.	Wompɛ no.
Sign your name below.	Fa wo nsa hyɛ wo din ase wɔ ase hɔ.
And that worked.	Na ɛno yɛɛ adwuma.
There were bad things here too.	Na nneɛma bɔne wɔ ha nso.
I didn’t know how to do it.	Ná minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ.
I thought it was just a big party.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ apontow kɛse bi kɛkɛ.
I think you will get better with time.	Misusuw sɛ bere kɔ so no, wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
Now everything works fine for him.	Seesei biribiara yɛ adwuma yiye ma no.
I hear he is very good.	Mete sɛ ɔyɛ papa paa.
I have to be present.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ obi a mewɔ hɔ.
In his feet.	Wɔ ne nan mu.
And bare feet.	Na nan a ɛda hɔ kwa.
How can one know for sure?.	Ɛbɛyɛ dɛn na obi ahu no yiye?.
Anyway, it would be long enough.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, anka ɛbɛyɛ tenten sɛnea ɛsɛ.
As this was the case.	Sɛnea na eyi te no.
But this is not the case today.	Nanso eyi nte saa nnɛ.
That was painful, too.	Ɛno nso yɛɛ yaw.
She would have been just as happy, happier, had it not been.	Anka n’ani begye saa ara, n’ani agye kɛse, sɛ ɛnyɛ saa a.
He was already doing very well.	Ná ɔreyɛ yiye paa dedaw.
Everyone wants them.	Obiara pɛ wɔn.
It would be nice to do that.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
I was told to make myself at home.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ menyɛ me ho wɔ fie.
It was a party room.	Ná ɛyɛ apontow dan.
His words were simple.	Ná ne nsɛm no yɛ mmerɛw.
Do not follow where the path may lead.	Nni baabi a ebia ɔkwan no bɛkɔ no akyi.
If this is true, the test case continues to execute.	Sɛ eyi yɛ nokware a, sɔhwɛ asɛm no kɔ so yɛ adwuma.
I know that’s the story.	Me nim saa asɛm no.
The girl nodded her head.	Abeawa no de ne ti too fam.
This worked well for the two of them.	Eyi yɛɛ adwuma yiye maa wɔn baanu no.
This would be the case.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ saa.
It was during the test that something went wrong.	Ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ no mu na biribi ankɔ yiye.
I get along well with myself.	Me ne me ho di yiye.
It had just happened.	Ná aba ara kwa.
The city got a bitter cold.	Kurow no nyaa awɔw a ano yɛ den.
Otherwise, he was just so cute.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, na ɔyɛ fɛ yiye ara kwa.
The old car, went on.	Kar dedaw no, kɔɔ so.
I really don't want to see them either.	Ankasa mempɛ sɛ mihu wɔn nso.
He claims her, and she claims him.	Ɔka sɛ ɔyɛ ne de, na ɔka sɛ ɔyɛ ne de.
However, that wasn’t great enough.	Nanso, na ɛno nyɛ kɛse sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Only if you can do it.	Sɛ wubetumi ayɛ nkutoo a.
He is someone you want to be with.	Ɔyɛ obi a wopɛ sɛ wo ne no bɔ.
Great job, no problem with that.	Adwuma kɛse, ɔhaw biara nni saa ho.
In any case,	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, .
I free myself every afternoon.	Mede me ho awia biara.
Are you excited about the new job?	So w’ani gye adwuma foforo no ho?
For a moment, that’s all.	Bere tiaa bi mu no, ɛno ara ne no.
I think it should be on the table.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ pon no so.
He wanted to tell her about his father.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka ne papa ho asɛm kyerɛ no.
Maybe he shouldn’t.	Ebia ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Sorry but it’s the truth.	Pa kyɛw nanso ɛyɛ nokware no.
One has to wonder what that means, to persist.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi susuw nea ɛno kyerɛ, sɛ ɔbɛkɔ so ayɛ saa no ho.
He didn't even know what he was anymore.	Ná onnim nea ɔyɛ mpo bio.
There was nothing for him but the window.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ mma no gye mfɛnsere no.
He even has my first name.	Ɔwɔ me din a edi kan mpo.
Several children were placed in juvenile detention this past year.	Wɔde mmofra pii kɔɔ mmofra a wɔde wɔn too afiase afe a etwaam yi mu.
But it had happened.	Nanso na asi.
And he did his best.	Na ɔyɛɛ nea obetumi biara.
Bright kids today want to be inventors.	Mmofra a wɔn ho akokwaw nnɛ pɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ nneɛma foforo.
They say you can’t reach you.	Wɔka sɛ worentumi nkɔ wo nkyɛn.
It’s always there.	Ɛwɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
Not that it mattered.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛho hia.
Now they are both equal.	Seesei wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
He forgot his lunch at home.	Ne werɛ fii ne awia aduan a odi wɔ fie no.
There is truth.	Nokware wɔ hɔ.
Naturally, his books have the same.	Sɛnea ɛte no, ne nhoma ahorow no nso wɔ saa ara.
No one uses money anymore.	Obiara mfa sika nni dwuma bio.
I want my mind to be the mind.	Mepɛ sɛ m’adwene yɛ adwene no.
The road to the.	Ɔkwan no.
He would do anything.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ biribiara.
So you had a mistake.	Enti na wowɔ mfomso bi.
It will be exciting.	Ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
Everyone felt it.	Obiara tee nka.
But after today .	Nanso nnɛ akyi no .
I'm getting bigger.	Meyɛ kɛse.
Nothing goes inside.	Biribiara nkɔ mu.
We do our best.	Yɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara.
Plan your move early.	Yɛ wo tu ho nhyehyɛe ntɛm.
I can’t think of anything else.	Mintumi nsusuw biribi foforo biara ho.
But after my time.	Nanso me bere akyi.
One doesn’t talk about it with enthusiasm.	Obi mfa anigye nka ho asɛm.
Do not sleep on his bed.	Mma nna ne mpa so.
This hat was old.	Ná saa kyɛw yi akyɛ.
They don’t need testing.	Sɔhwɛ ho nhia wɔn.
Be a good person.	Yɛ onipa pa.
He looked at her intently.	Ɔde adwene hwɛɛ no ​​denneennen.
Multitasking may be better for you.	Ebia nnwuma pii a wobɛyɛ no bɛyɛ papa ama wo.
But there may not be much time.	Nanso ebia bere pii nni hɔ.
You can’t be .	Worentumi nyɛ .
The end of the day.	Da no awiei.
A home needs people in it.	Ofie hia nnipa wɔ mu.
However, there are exceptions.	Nanso, nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛnyɛ saa.
And that’s good on them.	Na ɛno yɛ papa wɔ wɔn so.
You can also give them a new name.	Wubetumi nso de din foforo ama wɔn.
I spent hours playing with them as a kid.	Mede nnɔnhwerew pii ne wɔn dii agoru bere a na meyɛ abofra no.
It was almost completely empty.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛda hɔ kwa koraa.
He had it.	Ná ɔwɔ no.
It’s just a wonderful movie.	Ɛyɛ sini a ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
It was a wonderful meal.	Ná ɛyɛ aduan a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
But he wasn’t interested.	Nanso na n’ani nnye ho.
He was a wonderful child.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
So, it’s so true.	Enti, ɛyɛ nokware saa.
A really important point.	Asɛm a ɛho hia ankasa.
I don’t want to argue with them.	Mempɛ sɛ me ne wɔn begye akyinnye.
I have somewhere we can go.	Mewɔ baabi a yebetumi akɔ.
I love this dress.	Mepɛ saa atade yi.
Such a joy to have him in our school.	Anigye a ɛte saa sɛ yɛwɔ no wɔ yɛn sukuu mu.
The book contained many illustrations.	Ná mfonini ahorow pii wɔ nhoma no mu.
The rest follows.	Nea aka no di akyi.
It’s either my way or no way.	Ɛyɛ me kwan anaasɛ ɔkwan biara nni hɔ.
Any of this is happening.	Eyi mu biara rekɔ so.
Good quality for that price.	Su pa ma saa bo no.
He looks at her, too.	Ɔno nso hwɛ no.
You do not need to return it unless it is convenient for you.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode san ba gye sɛ ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw ama wo.
He really has to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ankasa.
This time, he may agree with you.	Saa bere yi de, ebia ɔne wo bɛyɛ adwene.
He didn't want to do anything else with this job.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde adwuma yi bɛyɛ biribi bio.
But not so much.	Nanso ɛnyɛ pii saa.
Or better yet.	Anaasɛ eye sen saa.
I think it will be fine.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
I wanted to go home.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ fie.
He was very excited.	Ná n’ani agye yiye.
He was very impressed.	N’ani gyee ho kɛse.
But there were some points that interested us.	Nanso na nsɛm bi wɔ hɔ a yɛn ani gye ho.
Everything was working fine.	Ná biribiara reyɛ adwuma yiye.
He was taken to the cell.	Wɔde no kɔɔ afiase dan no mu.
A really big help for us.	Mmoa kɛse ankasa ma yɛn.
If you don’t like it, fine.	Sɛ w’ani nnye ho a, eye.
They are almost identical.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔyɛ pɛ.
I knew this was it.	Ná minim sɛ eyi ne no.
Someone has to say.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi ka.
She handed him the package.	Ɔde ade a wɔde ahyɛ mu no maa no.
It was his fault.	Ná ɛyɛ ne mfomso.
However, I am not a party girl.	Nanso, menyɛ apontow ase abeawa.
Was that the case.	So na ɛte saa.
The problem is only getting worse, and it’s not getting any better.	Ɔhaw no reyɛ kɛse ara kwa, na ɛnyɛ yiye.
It’s a great opportunity.	Ɛyɛ hokwan kɛse.
Think about that with photos.	Susuw saa asɛm no ho wɔ mfonini ahorow ho.
He thought both.	Ná osusuw sɛ abien no nyinaa.
I’m very excited about it.	M’ani gye ho yiye.
I think you can do it right.	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi ayɛ no yiye.
He was a monster.	Ná ɔyɛ aboa kɛse bi.
It will be so.	Ɛbɛyɛ saa.
The hands were warm.	Ná nsa no mu yɛ hyew.
This is obviously nothing of the sort.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
He knows that very well.	Onim saa asɛm no yiye.
That was certainly true for me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛno yɛ nokware ma me.
Perhaps he	Ebia ɔno .
So it’s a sin.	Enti ɛyɛ bɔne.
I am a lucky boy.	Meyɛ abarimaa a mewɔ anigye.
Three more shots on it.	Tuo foforo abiɛsa wɔ so.
Our room wasn't too bad.	Ná yɛn dan no nyɛ bɔne dodo.
This system works for me.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi yɛ adwuma ma me.
And yet, it doesn’t have to be.	Na nanso, ɛho nhia sɛ ɛte saa.
There was no one there.	Ná obiara nni hɔ.
That’s how you can help him.	Saa na wubetumi aboa no.
I am so sorry about this situation.	Ɛyɛ me yaw paa wɔ tebea yi ho.
But it does exist.	Nanso ɛwɔ hɔ.
Where it is now.	Baabi a ɛwɔ mprempren.
He kicked his legs.	Ɔde ne nan bɔɔ ne nan mu.
We had plans.	Ná yɛwɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow.
I don’t have to talk to you.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa.
And she was beautiful.	Na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I had enough of that too.	Ná mewɔ ɛno nso a ɛdɔɔso.
He was inside her.	Ná ɔwɔ ne mu.
Be late for dinner.	Ka akyi wɔ anwummere aduan mu.
So, naturally, this is my favorite.	Enti, sɛnea ɛte no, eyi ne nea m’ani gye ho paa.
There was a big traffic accident.	Ná kar akwanhyia kɛse wɔ hɔ.
His talk was received with enthusiasm.	Wɔde anigye gyee ne kasa no.
Somehow, he knew it was water.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na onim sɛ ɛyɛ nsu.
I still didn’t feel empty.	Ná meda so ara nte nka sɛ biribiara nni hɔ.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
Put on your winter clothes.	Hyɛ wo awɔw bere mu ntade.
Everyone has to think for themselves.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara ankasa susuw ho.
I don’t want this.	Mempɛ eyi.
It’s even bigger than that.	Ɛyɛ kɛse mpo sen saa.
It’s not with me.	Ɛnyɛ me nkyɛn.
Don’t let me doubt myself anymore.	Mma me nnye me ho kyim bio.
He had some of it.	Ná ɔwɔ bi.
This is one of them.	Eyi yɛ biako.
The whole city shuts down.	Kurow no nyinaa to mu.
But that’s not really the point here.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no ankasa wɔ ha.
But this work is exciting.	Nanso saa adwuma yi yɛ anigye.
Which is hard, man.	Nea ɛyɛ den, onipa.
If you can find one, go for it.	Sɛ wubetumi anya bi a, kɔ.
Or a person, for that matter.	Anaasɛ onipa bi, ɛno nti.
It was a real dog.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔkraman ankasa.
This is not easy for him.	Eyi nyɛ mmerɛw mma no.
This much you need to know.	Eyi pii na ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
I love the picture below.	M’ani gye mfonini a ɛwɔ ase ha no ho.
Many children played in the park.	Mmofra pii dii agoru wɔ abɔnten so.
Or finally used for.	Anaasɛ awiei koraa no wɔde di dwuma ma.
I have another story now.	Mewɔ asɛm foforo mprempren.
In other words, all the things that really matter.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, nneɛma a ɛho hia ankasa no nyinaa.
This picture is simple.	Saa mfonini yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
The house is beautiful and comfortable.	Ofie no yɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ fɛ.
Just say you don’t want to.	Ka kɛkɛ sɛ wompɛ.
So everything keeps running.	Enti biribiara kɔ so tu mmirika.
There was only one thing to do.	Ade biako pɛ na na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Give the man all the money you have!	Fa sika a wowɔ nyinaa ma ɔbarima no!
I have my own.	Mewɔ me de no.
It’s just not really a good thing at all.	Ɛnyɛ ade pa ankasa koraa kɛkɛ.
This is a serious problem.	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
But that is nothing new.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ ade foforo.
He knew she was beautiful.	Ná onim sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
This child loves simple tasks.	Abofra yi ani gye nnwuma a ɛnyɛ den ho.
He can go where he wants.	Obetumi akɔ baabi a ɔpɛ.
What did you remember?	Dɛn na wokae?
He was a man now.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima mprempren.
Most people are still powerless.	Nnipa dodow no ara da so ara nni tumi.
And that this can happen again and again.	Na sɛ eyi betumi asi mpɛn pii.
He knew what he had to do.	Ná onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
But if he does.	Nanso sɛ ɔyɛ saa a.
If you don’t know, pick one up.	Sɛ wunnim a, fa biako.
More would have been better.	Anka pii bɛyɛ papa.
I want you to tell me what you think.	Mepɛ sɛ woka nea wususuw kyerɛ me.
Maybe never.	Ebia ɛnyɛ da.
But there is much more to see here.	Nanso nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ahu wɔ ha.
The problem is that the story doesn’t end there.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ asɛm no nkɔ awiei wɔ hɔ.
It’s a hot day.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ hyew.
He was certainly strong.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ne ho yɛ den.
But people don’t think so.	Nanso nkurɔfo nsusuw saa.
There may have been many of them.	Ebia na wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
The first afternoon.	Awia a edi kan no.
This is hardly surprising.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ eyi nyɛ nwonwa.
Walk away now.	Nantew kɔ mprempren.
But that was not his nature.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ne su ne saa.
But this is not the case.	Nanso eyi nte saa.
Keep watching everyone.	Kɔ so hwɛ obiara.
He put his hands on her legs.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne nan mu.
He is always very punctual.	Ɔyɛ obi a odi bere so yiye bere nyinaa.
He lacked focus.	Ná onni adwene a ɔde besi biribi so.
Sure, you should have been told that’s what the meeting looked like.	Ampa, anka ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka kyerɛ wo sɛ saa na nhyiam no te.
He snuggles against my back.	Ɔde me ho hyɛ me akyi.
His condition was not very good.	Ná ne tebea nyɛ papa pii.
Or a system.	Anaasɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
I felt really weird.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
Later is here now.	Akyiri yi wɔ ha mprempren.
He was imprisoned.	Wɔde no too afiase.
I can drive to school, if you like.	Metumi de kar akɔ sukuu, sɛ wopɛ a.
Money only went so far.	Sika kɔɔ akyiri saa nkutoo.
It was like nothing else.	Ná ɛte sɛ biribi foforo biara.
That always makes it difficult.	Ɛno ma ɛyɛ den bere nyinaa.
I felt that he would help me.	Ná mete nka sɛ ɔbɛboa me.
You have been very important to so many of us.	Woayɛ obi a ɛho hia yɛn mu pii paa.
I really didn’t care.	Ankasa na ɛnyɛ me asɛm.
Or he does, but he doesn’t like it.	Anaasɛ ɔyɛ saa, nanso n’ani nnye ho.
He had to pretend to be normal.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ne ho sɛ obi a ɔte ase.
Many things could have happened.	Ná nneɛma pii betumi asi.
It’s still there.	Ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
It’s too simplistic.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
But it seemed to be an important issue.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛho hia.
There was no doubt that it would.	Ná akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
First, give this to your mother.	Nea edi kan no, fa eyi ma wo maame.
You knew he would.	Ná wunim sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
This was a job, like any other.	Ná eyi yɛ adwuma, te sɛ adwuma foforo biara.
If only his mother were here.	Sɛ ne maame wɔ ha a.
A great man indeed.	Onipa kɛse ampa.
So sit down, wear it!.	Enti tra ase, hyɛ no!.
It was powerful, but in full force.	Na ɛyɛ tumi, nanso na ɛwɔ tumi a edi mũ mu.
In a sense, he is.	Ɔkwan biako so no, ɔte saa.
It’s a good team.	Ɛyɛ kuw pa.
Was the project a success?	So adwuma no yɛɛ yiye?
In many cases.	Wɔ nsɛm pii mu.
Maybe you can help me.	Ebia wubetumi aboa me.
Two things are important.	Nneɛma abien na ɛho hia.
I think it’s an accident.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ akwanhyia.
Everything goes down.	Biribiara kɔ fam.
He played a lot of fun with his music.	Ɔde ne nnwom bɔɔ anigye pii.
Do the same for yours.	Wo de nso yɛ saa.
It is something we have to do and use.	Ɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ na yɛde di dwuma.
I felt bad about it.	Metee nka bɔne wɔ ho.
That’s the best time.	Ɛno ne bere a eye sen biara.
It’s all of those things.	Ɛyɛ saa nneɛma no nyinaa.
Ideal for multiple loads.	Ɛyɛ nea eye ma nneɛma pii a wɔde fa nneɛma.
He has to work for his path.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma ma ne kwan no.
The path is there.	Ɔkwan no wɔ hɔ.
That is the most common.	Ɛno ne nea abu so sen biara.
Doing so is a sign of weakness.	Ɛno a wobɛyɛ no kyerɛ sɛ woayɛ mmerɛw.
Check before using.	Hwɛ ansa na wode adi dwuma.
The tall man walked to the window.	Ɔbarima tenten no nantew kɔɔ mfɛnsere no ho.
I hardly know him.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ minnim no.
It was the same thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade koro no ara.
It was very, very scary.	Ná ɛyɛ hu yiye paa.
In his unconditional care.	Wɔ ne hwɛ a tebea biara nni mu.
You have no idea how much trouble he can cause.	Wunnim ɔhaw dodow a obetumi de aba no ho adwene biara.
The project was a great success.	Adwuma no dii yiye kɛse.
If you already have one, good for you.	Sɛ wowɔ bi dedaw a, eye ma wo.
I also did a few other things.	Meyɛɛ nneɛma foforo kakraa bi nso.
I saw it yesterday morning.	Mihuu no nnɛra anɔpa.
It was just great.	Na ɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa.
At least he could give her that much.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na obetumi de saa dodow no ama no.
We will use it.	Yɛde bɛyɛ adwuma.
Work as much as you can in the time	Yɛ adwuma dodow biara a wubetumi wɔ bere no mu
The story is over.	Asɛm no aba awiei.
Which still exists today.	Nea ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ nnɛ.
That has been a smart play.	Ɛno ayɛ agoru a nyansa wom.
More importantly, everyone else knew too.	Nea ɛho hia sen saa no, na obiara a aka no nso nim.
He wanted to be human, but he wasn’t.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ onipa, nanso na ɔnyɛ saa.
Inside was a diary.	Ná da biara da nsɛm nhoma bi wɔ mu.
Eventually, people began to move.	Awiei koraa no, nkurɔfo fii ase tu.
Think about them over the next few days.	Susuw wɔn ho wɔ nna kakraa a edi hɔ no mu.
I didn’t want to do anything with it.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mede biribi yɛ.
But he did it anyway.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ saa ɔkwan biara so.
Giving him hope.	Anidaso a ɔde bɛma no.
You can’t do just one thing and not the other.	Worentumi nyɛ ade biako pɛ na worentumi nyɛ biako no.
You can do whatever you like with it.	Wubetumi de ayɛ biribiara a w’ani gye ho.
And no one is lying.	Na obiara nni atoro.
Everything just feels tighter and tighter.	Biribiara te nka ara kwa sɛ ɛyɛ den na ɛyɛ den.
I don’t want anyone to go to him.	Mempɛ sɛ obiara nkɔ ne nkyɛn.
This is not entirely clear.	Eyi mu nna hɔ koraa.
It had been days and days.	Ná ayɛ nna ne nna.
I do indeed do that.	Meyɛ saa ampa.
He is telling the truth.	Ɔka nokware.
But there is nothing he can do.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
I hope that is not true.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno nyɛ nokware.
Start below!.	Fi ase wɔ ase ha!.
And your wife loves it.	Na wo yere nso ani gye ho.
This was a surprise.	Ná eyi yɛ nwonwa.
And you want me to be you.	Na wopɛ sɛ meyɛ wo ho.
He has something for everyone.	Ɔwɔ biribi ma obiara.
Or a car?.	Anaasɛ kar?.
You can see it right away.	Wubetumi ahu no ntɛm ara.
Thrive!.	Kɔ so!.
Not that year, not every year.	Ɛnyɛ saa afe no, ɛnyɛ afe biara.
This is what foods look like.	Eyi ne sɛnea aduan ahorow te.
He didn't know it was happening.	Ná onnim sɛ ɛrekɔ so.
No way, not later.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ, ɛnyɛ akyiri yi.
But still no fun.	Nanso ɛda so ara yɛ anigye biara.
See how you do it.	Hwɛ sɛnea woyɛ.
But that wasn’t good enough for him.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ papa mma no.
If you want me to do that.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ meyɛ saa a.
Do you see what you are doing?	So wuhu nea woreyɛ no?
That’s not what we do with the child.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea yɛyɛ wɔ abofra no ho.
You can keep going inside.	Wubetumi akɔ so akɔ mu.
None of you told anyone.	Mo mu biara anka ankyerɛ obiara.
The cold continued.	Awɔw no kɔɔ so.
The rest of it.	Nea aka wɔ ho.
But it does exist.	Nanso ɛwɔ hɔ.
Better than he knows himself, maybe.	Ɛyɛ papa sen sɛ onim ne ho, ebia.
On his shorts.	Wɔ ne ntade tiaa no so.
The prison is there	Afiase no wɔ hɔ
He was a part of me.	Ná ɔyɛ me fã bi.
Investors were impressed.	Ná wɔn a wɔde wɔn sika hyɛ mu no ani gyee ho.
Every day, every week, every year.	Da biara da, dapɛn biara, afe biara.
About a week after the accident.	Akwanhyia no akyi bɛyɛ dapɛn biako.
I can’t figure out what he is.	Me ntumi nhu nea ɔyɛ.
You can’t do that.	Worentumi nyɛ saa.
But the work was daunting.	Nanso na adwuma no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
It was pretty cold last night.	Ná awɔw wom yiye anadwo a etwaam no.
Or at least that’s what he tells her.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na ɔka kyerɛ.
These things are not dangerous.	Saa nneɛma yi nyɛ asiane biara.
My mind started racing.	M’adwene fii ase tu mmirika.
I'm a scientist.	Meyɛ ɔkraman.
I have pictures.	Mewɔ mfonini ahorow.
He has a strong handshake.	Ɔwɔ nsa a wɔde bɔ no denneennen.
I knew him.	Ná minim no.
He was underwater now and so was she.	Ná ɔwɔ nsu ase mprempren na na ɔno nso te saa ara.
That sounds good.	Ɛno te sɛ nea eye.
It was a job.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma bi.
That’s not such a pleasant story.	Ɛno nyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye saa.
You don’t want one anyway.	Wompɛ biako ɔkwan biara so.
Support.	Mmoa.
Such things as these.	Nneɛma a ɛte saa.
What a wonderful summer!	Awɔw bere a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni!
I must say you have done a fantastic job with this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ woayɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ eyi ho.
This actually happened.	Eyi sii ankasa.
That doesn’t really mean anything.	Ɛno nkyerɛ hwee ankasa.
Everything is clear and focused.	Biribiara mu da hɔ na wɔde wɔn adwene asi so.
Maybe you can do the same but the language doesn’t help.	Ebia wubetumi ayɛ saa ara nanso kasa no mmoa.
I absolutely loved this one.	M’ani gyee eyi ho koraa.
This was a very difficult task.	Ná eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den yiye.
You can just look at the child.	Wubetumi ahwɛ abofra no ara kwa.
Consider another scenario.	Susuw tebea foforo bi ho hwɛ.
Think of it as a movie.	Fa no sɛ sini.
Finally, he had his way.	Awiei koraa no, na ɔwɔ ne kwan.
What is it?.	Ɛyɛ dɛn?.
It was terrible.	Ná ɛyɛ hu.
We really enjoyed it.	Yɛn ani gyee ho paa.
Or try to do something about it.	Anaasɛ bɔ mmɔden sɛ wobɛyɛ ho biribi.
Everyone should go to lunch.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara kɔ awia aduan.
The point is, there is no issue.	Asɛm no ne sɛ, asɛm biara nni hɔ.
At least for a while.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, bere tiaa bi.
You totally get it.	Wo nsa ka no koraa.
It’s such a good thing.	Ɛyɛ ade pa a ɛte saa.
There were no objects inside.	Ná nneɛma biara nni mu.
It works on most everything.	Ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ biribiara dodow no ara so.
But this man was filled with great sin.	Nanso ɔbarima yi, ɔde bɔne kɛse hyɛɛ no ​​ma.
His arms and legs ached.	Ne nsa ne ne nan yɛɛ yaw.
It wasn’t like that for a while.	Ná ɛnyɛ saa bere tiaa bi.
I can’t think of it that way.	Mintumi nsusuw ho saa.
He slipped his hands inside.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ mu.
I believe it was.	Migye di sɛ na ɛte saa.
I hear them.	Mete wɔn.
However, no one ever noticed.	Nanso, obiara anhu da.
So the more the better, maybe.	Enti dodow no ara na eye, ebia.
If he can.	Sɛ obetumi a.
I saw him again the following week.	Mihuu no bio dapɛn a edi hɔ no.
It’s not easy at all.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
That’s what people would want me to do.	Saa na nkurɔfo bɛpɛ sɛ meyɛ.
I am used to the water.	Nsu no ayɛ me su.
That was a long time ago, though.	Nanso, na ɛno yɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
The party ended early.	Apontow no baa awiei ntɛm.
He was here.	Ná ɔwɔ ha.
I'm not sure what's going on here.	Me nnim nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha.
Sex is not easy for me.	Nna nyɛ mmerɛw mma me.
You just do it.	Woyɛ no ara kwa.
It is very very expensive.	Ɛyɛ nea ne bo yɛ den yiye paa.
I don't really have much else to say.	Minni nsɛm foforo pii a mɛka ankasa.
This product is the best.	Saa ade yi ne nea eye sen biara.
Not too much the more.	Ɛnyɛ pii dodo no sen saa.
You have to treat both pretty much the same way.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne abien no nyinaa di no ɔkwan koro so.
That has been going on for years.	Ɛno akɔ so mfe pii ni.
The test will be easy.	Sɔhwɛ no bɛyɛ mmerɛw.
And those two hit him.	Na saa baanu no bɔɔ no.
It was late.	Ná aka akyi.
The idea was very interesting.	Ná adwene no yɛ anigye yiye.
That started the other day.	Ɛno fii ase da bi a atwam no.
It must be strange to be so perfect.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ yɛbɛyɛ pɛ saa.
Wear warm clothes.	Hyɛ ntade a ɛyɛ hyew.
So was the other guy.	Saa ara na na ɔbarima foforo no nso te.
It is the best stay in every way.	Ɛyɛ tra a eye sen biara wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
That model no longer works.	Saa mfonini no nyɛ adwuma bio.
When lives were in danger.	Bere a na nkwa da asiane mu no.
If he wants to do this, so be it.	Sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ eyi a, ɛnyɛ saa.
I just thought you should know.	Misusuwii kɛkɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
He knows their names.	Onim wɔn din.
It must be too late.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ aka akyi paa.
But he did it anyway.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ saa ɔkwan biara so.
In animals this is an old story.	Wɔ mmoa mu no eyi yɛ asɛm dedaw bi.
You have a lot to say.	Wowɔ nsɛm pii a wobɛka.
I am very grateful to both of them.	Meda wɔn baanu nyinaa ase paa.
Surely it would have been.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
He knew he knew.	Ná onim sɛ onim.
And the day of the transfer.	Na da a wɔde bɛkɔ baabi foforo no.
That’s what we need to work on.	Ɛno ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho adwuma.
It is not common.	Ɛnyɛ nea abu so.
But the food is another story.	Nanso aduan no yɛ asɛm foforo.
And it works well.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
He did it right.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​saa.
Everyone seems to do something for you.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara yɛ ade ma wo.
It amazes me how much he really enjoyed it.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa sɛnea n’ani gyee ho ankasa no.
I'm really, really sorry.	Mepa wo kyɛw ankasa, ankasa.
Not out here.	Ɛnyɛ ha akyi.
However, the story is not so simple as it sounds.	Nanso, asɛm no nyɛ mmerɛw saa sɛnea ɛte no.
He knew he had to work fast.	Ná onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma ntɛmntɛm.
I know you don’t want to believe this.	Minim sɛ wompɛ sɛ wugye eyi di.
The first job is the best.	Adwuma a edi kan no ne nea eye sen biara.
Now is the time to get involved.	Mprempren ne bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu.
That made us stronger.	Ɛno maa yɛn ho yɛɛ den.
This should not cause any problems.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi de ɔhaw biara ba.
He works long hours every day.	Ɔyɛ adwuma nnɔnhwerew pii da biara.
The house feels cold and empty.	Ofie no te nka sɛ awɔw wom na hwee nni hɔ.
And that’s really the whole point.	Na ɛno ne asɛm no nyinaa ankasa.
But they don’t have to.	Nanso enhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
You have done quite well.	Woayɛ no yiye koraa.
People know each other’s business.	Nkurɔfo nim wɔn ho wɔn ho adwuma.
If you’re with the wrong person, it feels like you’re overworked.	Sɛ wo ne onipa a ɔnyɛ papa na ɛwɔ hɔ a, ɛte sɛ nea woayɛ adwuma dodo.
So it didn’t surprise anyone.	Enti anyɛ obiara nwonwa.
Just like in that case you told me.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ saa asɛm no mu a woka kyerɛɛ me no ara pɛ.
And it didn’t.	Na anyɛ saa.
Have a good afternoon everyone.	Ma obiara awia pa.
This is the interesting one.	Eyi ne nea ɛyɛ anigye no.
We just connected with each other.	Yɛde yɛn ho bɔɔ yɛn ho yɛn ho ara kwa.
Not that that matters now.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛno ho hia mprempren.
No one uses them for food.	Obiara mfa wɔn nyɛ wɔn aduan.
But the truth is even more painful.	Nanso nokware no yɛ yaw kɛse mpo.
She is a very nice person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
In better shape than you.	Wɔ tebea a eye sen wo mu.
I wanted something better.	Ná mepɛ biribi a eye sen saa.
Run the tests.	Fa sɔhwɛ ahorow no tu mmirika.
We are very good at it.	Yɛn ho akokwaw wɔ mu kɛse.
And we do the same thing.	Na yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa ara.
It was a working animal.	Ná ɛyɛ aboa a ɔyɛ adwuma bi.
Even in the winter.	Wɔ awɔw bere mu mpo.
We can do it all.	Yebetumi ayɛ ne nyinaa.
I'm attached to him.	Mede ne ho abɔ ne ho.
I was shocked.	Me ho dwiriw me.
That’s what we do for them.	Ɛno ne nea yɛyɛ ma wɔn.
It’s really cold down there.	Ɛyɛ awɔw ankasa wɔ fam hɔ.
He was not a great man.	Ná ɔnyɛ onipa kɛse.
I'm a girl.	Meyɛ abeawa.
His presence meant nothing to her.	Ná ne ba a ɔwɔ hɔ no nkyerɛ hwee mma no.
First, it is expensive.	Nea edi kan no, ne bo yɛ den.
What a painful story.	Asɛm a ɛyɛ yaw bɛn ara ni.
But it is something to consider.	Nanso ɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
Otherwise I have one more idea.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a mewɔ adwene biako bio.
I can’t see it.	Mintumi nhu.
There is nothing to be done about that now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ wɔ saa asɛm no ho mprempren.
On their own.	Wɔ wɔn ankasa so.
What is the city like?	Kurow no te dɛn?
But something, something.	Nanso biribi, biribi.
You need to get along with him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no bɔ yiye.
Most of these people are unemployed.	Saa nnipa yi mu dodow no ara nni adwuma.
It has been a fascinating experience.	Ayɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
The girl was like that.	Abeawa no na ɛte saa.
So it was the same house.	Enti na ɛyɛ ofie koro no ara.
So the situation is quite desperate.	Enti tebea no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu koraa.
It was just too big.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse dodo ara kwa.
He has a lot of power.	Ɔwɔ tumi pii.
Her hair was slicked back.	Ná ne ti nhwi no ayɛ mmerɛw akɔ akyi.
Water will be	Nsu bɛyɛ
I should have driven.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka kar.
A letter is attached.	Wɔde krataa bi aka ho.
It was the first film of its kind.	Ɛno ne sini a edi kan a ɛte saa.
The news was bound to come sooner or later.	Ná akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ asɛm no bɛba ntɛm anaa akyiri yi.
He was just great with himself.	Ná ɔyɛ ne ho kɛse ara kwa.
The end of the story.	Asɛm no awiei.
Processes seem simple.	Ɛte sɛ nea nneɛma a wɔyɛ no yɛ mmerɛw.
In other words, he spoke my language.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, na ɔka me kasa.
This was not to be one of them.	Na ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ wɔn mu biako.
Everyone has things.	Obiara wɔ nneɛma.
It was amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It exists after money.	Ɛwɔ hɔ wɔ sika akyi.
New business is not that great.	Adwuma foforo a wɔyɛ no nyɛ kɛse saa.
And other things, what he wanted to tell me.	Na nneɛma foforo nso, nea na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ me.
Making music was a business.	Ná nnwom a wɔyɛ no yɛ adwuma.
So does he, too.	Saa ara na ɔno nso yɛ.
One group went here, one group went there.	Kuw biako kɔɔ ha, kuw biako kɔɔ hɔ.
Not just for the money though.	Ɛnyɛ sika no nkutoo de.
He thinks she is beautiful.	Osusuw sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Think about it again.	Susuw ho bio.
He had no water.	Ná onni nsu biara.
Don’t make this mistake.	Mma saa mfomso yi nyɛ.
Just wanting to thank you.	Nea mepɛ sɛ meda wo ase nkutoo.
Right now, there is no internal work going on.	Seesei ara, adwuma biara nni hɔ a ɛrekɔ so wɔ mu.
I like that guy.	M’ani gye saa ɔbarima no ho.
It’s all too clear.	Ne nyinaa mu da hɔ dodo.
Even then my price was often too high.	Saa bere no mpo na me bo taa yɛ kɛse dodo.
It was never really an issue for us.	Na ɛnyɛ asɛm ankasa mma yɛn da.
Those people were very happy.	Ná saa nkurɔfo no ani agye yiye.
First week at classes.	Dapɛn a edi kan wɔ adesua ahorow ase.
But you know it was.	Nanso wunim sɛ na ɛte saa.
That was my only hope.	Ná ɛno nkutoo ne anidaso a mewɔ.
Life is short.	Nkwa yɛ tiaa.
So make the appointment today.	Enti yɛ nhyehyɛe no nnɛ.
No one else knew about it.	Na obi foforo biara nnim ho asɛm.
These uses have continued.	Saa nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma yi akɔ so.
There are at least a few risks.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, asiane kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Plan your weekend in advance.	Di kan yɛ wo dapɛn awiei ho nhyehyɛe.
You can handle this.	Wubetumi adi eyi ho dwuma.
My situation was very similar to yours.	Ná me tebea no te sɛ wo de no yiye.
Maybe it’s outdated.	Ebia ne bere atwam.
I have included many of them here.	Mede wɔn pii aka ho wɔ ha.
This was no easy task.	Eyi anyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I want to hang out with them.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wɔn bɔ.
It’s all new.	Ne nyinaa yɛ foforo.
Never see or hear anyone again.	Nhu anaa nte obiara nka bio.
You don’t do that.	Wonyɛ saa.
Soak in, the water is amazing!	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu, nsu no yɛ nwonwa!
These clothes are very expensive.	Saa ntade yi bo yɛ den yiye.
Whatever, he was here now and definitely wanted to fuck me.	Nea ɛte biara no, na ɔwɔ ha mprempren na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔbɔ me.
The door was always in the way.	Ná ɔpon no hyɛ kwan no mu bere nyinaa.
Like, say, another year.	Te sɛ, ka sɛ, afe foforo.
And let him be quick about it.	Na ma ɔnyɛ ntɛm wɔ ho.
He seemed to have no name.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onni din.
He has sent a letter.	Ɔde krataa bi akɔ.
No one you know.	Obiara nni hɔ a wunim no.
Another day, another set of meetings.	Da foforo, nhyiam ahorow foforo.
I just had to say it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka ara kwa.
Everything was there.	Na biribiara a ɛwɔ hɔ no wɔ hɔ.
That’s not a good thing.	Ɛno nyɛ ade pa.
Many amazing animals are in danger.	Mmoa a wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa pii wɔ asiane mu.
I feel that way.	Mete nka saa.
I have nothing to do with any of them.	Me ne wɔn mu biara nni hwee yɛ.
That is a complete lie.	Ɛno yɛ atoro koraa.
In another month, a month and a half, maybe.	Wɔ ɔsram foforo mu, ɔsram biako ne fã, ebia.
He just got me involved.	Ɔde me ho hyɛɛ mu ara kwa.
He hurried into the car.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm kɔɔ kar no mu.
Even you know that.	Wo mpo nim saa.
There are a few reasons why.	Nneɛma kakraa bi na enti ɛte saa.
I just felt terrible.	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ hu ara kwa.
In their own minds.	Wɔ wɔn ankasa adwene mu.
I didn’t have to do that.	Ná enhia sɛ meyɛ saa.
We are stronger than they are.	Yɛyɛ den sen wɔn.
A boy and a man.	Abarimaa ne ɔbarima.
He was indeed a gun.	Ná ɔyɛ tuo ampa.
This arrangement is interesting for several reasons.	Nneɛma pii nti na nhyehyɛe yi yɛ anigye.
But he was strong, that was clear.	Nanso na ne ho yɛ den, na ɛno mu da hɔ.
Everything is new and very challenging.	Biribiara yɛ foforo na ɛyɛ den yiye.
But they don’t matter.	Nanso wɔn ho nhia.
Perhaps another important indicator is water quality.	Ebia ade foforo a ɛho hia a wɔde kyerɛ ne sɛnea nsu no te.
So many of us were like that.	Enti na yɛn mu pii te saa.
I had no idea.	Ná minni adwene biara.
I was all of those people.	Ná meyɛ saa nnipa no nyinaa.
It is not a bright prospect.	Ɛnyɛ anidaso a ɛyɛ anigye.
Your work and your business matters to us.	Wo adwuma ne wo adwuma no ho hia yɛn.
Do what you have to do.	Yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Things were going well.	Ná nneɛma rekɔ yiye.
What you loved to do.	Nea na w’ani gye ho sɛ wobɛyɛ.
In such a situation.	Wɔ tebea a ɛte saa mu.
And without anyone.	Na a obiara nni hɔ.
However, it is not.	Nanso, ɛnte saa.
He knew what he had to do.	Ná onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
And therein lies part of the problem.	Na ɛno mu na ɔhaw no fã bi da.
He is happy.	Ɔwɔ anigye.
They walk with their hands.	Wɔde wɔn nsa nantew.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
He had done it again.	Ná wayɛ bio.
No one knew him.	Ná obiara nnim no.
He was a good addition.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔka ho yiye.
If it’s really hot, I can’t take it.	Sɛ ɛyɛ hyew ankasa a, me ntumi mfa no.
For such a long time.	Bere tenten a ɛte saa.
I get it now.	Me nsa ka mprempren.
This is a party for you.	Eyi yɛ apontow ma wo.
Go into the bedroom.	Kɔ mpa no mu.
It is indeed successful indeed.	Ɛyɛ yiye ampa ampa.
He just wasn't his type at all.	Ná ɔnyɛ ne su koraa kɛkɛ.
I knew what he looked like.	Ná minim sɛnea ɔte.
If it’s ever needed, I can do it.	Sɛ ɛho hia da bi a, metumi ayɛ.
I want to believe him.	Mepɛ sɛ migye no di.
I don't know about anyone else.	Minnim obi foforo biara ho asɛm.
If someone is hurting you, you tell me.	Sɛ obi reyɛ wo bɔne a, woka kyerɛ me.
Maybe they are right.	Ebia wɔn asɛm no yɛ nokware.
Just remember you are not alone.	Kae kɛkɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo na wowɔ hɔ.
At least not for a long time, and not today.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ bere tenten, na ɛnyɛ nnɛ nso.
Everything in it is true and false.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ mu no yɛ nokware ne atoro.
Or rather, there is.	Anaasɛ, ɛwɔ hɔ.
Cold and perfect.	Awɔw na ɛyɛ pɛ.
You can travel now if you want.	Wubetumi atu kwan mprempren sɛ wopɛ a.
Maybe he didn’t know himself.	Ebia na onnim ne ho.
Not everyone was so impressed.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na n’ani gyee ho saa.
He wasn't the same after that.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa ara wɔ ɛno akyi.
I don’t think it is.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛnte saa.
At least then we would be safe.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa bere no anka yɛn ho bɛtɔ yɛn.
Only then can we deal with the situation.	Ɛno akyi nkutoo na yebetumi adi tebea no ho dwuma.
That one is interesting.	Saa biako no ani gye ho.
I love this product and the price is good.	M’ani gye saa ade yi ho na ne bo yɛ papa.
The situation was tense.	Ná tebea no mu yɛ den.
It should have been done a long time ago.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no bere tenten a atwam ni.
This raw material is used to make paper.	Saa ade a wɔde yɛ nneɛma yi na wɔde yɛ krataa.
Stay in bed.	Tra mpa so.
I think it would be amazing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nwonwa.
Friends are there for friends.	Nnamfo wɔ hɔ ma nnamfo.
He wants to play.	Ɔpɛ sɛ odi agoru.
Both work similarly to manage work.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ adwuma saa ara de hwɛ adwuma so.
I was with someone.	Ná me ne obi wɔ hɔ.
Everyone wants to be successful and happy.	Obiara pɛ sɛ odi yiye na n’ani gye.
He would process what had happened.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ nea asi no ho adwuma.
They are what we are made of.	Wɔn ne nea wɔde ayɛ yɛn.
It’s not just cars on my mind.	Ɛnyɛ kar nkutoo na ɛwɔ m’adwene.
And something went wrong here.	Na biribi anyɛ yiye wɔ ha.
She liked being beautiful.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ.
That was very popular at the time.	Ná ɛno yɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse saa bere no.
Otherwise, this is a really nice situation book.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, eyi yɛ tebea nhoma a ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
And maybe that’s all he was surprised by.	Na ebia ɛno ara ne sɛ ne ho dwiriw no.
But he was a man of action.	Nanso na ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ ade.
The boy was leaving.	Ná abarimaa no rekɔ.
He was impressed, too.	Ɔno nso ani gyee ho.
It was good stuff.	Ná ɛyɛ nneɛma pa.
And that you are there.	Na sɛ wowɔ hɔ.
A happy ending!	Awiei a ɛyɛ anigye!
No girl with that name here.	Abeawa biara nni hɔ a ɔwɔ saa din no wɔ ha.
I just wanted to talk to him, to talk to him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa kɛkɛ, sɛ me ne no kasa.
Don’t do this.	Mma wonyɛ eyi.
That’s your problem.	Ɛno ne wo haw.
I find that interesting.	Mihu sɛ saa asɛm no yɛ anigye.
They spoke a different language.	Ná wɔka kasa foforo.
It looks great in your bedroom or living room.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye wɔ wo mpa anaa wo dan mu.
So make sure you do it right.	Enti hwɛ hu sɛ wobɛyɛ no yiye.
They just seem to do it.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔyɛ ara kwa.
There is hope here.	Anidaso wɔ ha.
It’s a good name.	Ɛyɛ din pa.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho.
He was definitely on the wrong track.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔwɔ ɔkwan bɔne so.
Maybe my father was right.	Ebia na me papa asɛm no yɛ nokware.
We can incorporate that.	Yebetumi de saa asɛm no ahyɛ mu.
Playing with him is just so much fun.	Sɛ wo ne no bedi agoru a, ɛyɛ anigye kɛse ara kwa.
Apparently, no one else did.	Ɛda adi sɛ, obi foforo nso anyɛ saa.
They both knew that.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa nim saa.
Sure enough, one day he asked me to do something.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, da koro bi ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ menyɛ biribi.
I have committed a sin.	Mayɛ bɔne.
She was not a pretty girl.	Ná ɔnyɛ abeawa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
He seemed pretty normal.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ obi a ɔte ase yiye.
The children were nearby.	Ná mmofra no bɛn hɔ.
I was there this morning.	Na mewɔ hɔ anɔpa yi.
I think this boy thought he could do anything.	Misusuw sɛ abarimaa yi susuwii sɛ obetumi ayɛ biribiara.
That is their only fault.	Ɛno nkutoo ne wɔn mfomso.
Make it seem unimportant.	Ma ɛnyɛ te sɛ nea ɛho nhia.
But pretty much everyone else is pretty sure.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara a aka no gye di yiye.
There was a great deal of work to be done.	Ná adwuma kɛse bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
In the morning he felt better.	Anɔpa no ne ho tɔɔ no.
I was deeply moved by the story.	Asɛm no kaa me paa.
It’s really hard to drive like that.	Ɛyɛ den ankasa sɛ wobɛka kar saa.
That first week was really hard.	Saa dapɛn a edi kan no yɛɛ den ankasa.
Lots and lots of money.	Sika pii ne pii.
Maybe he knows something about it.	Ebia onim ho biribi.
Someone knows better.	Obi nim yiye.
He looked pretty normal.	Ná ɔte sɛ nea ɔte ase yiye.
Whatever that means.	Nea ɛno kyerɛ biara.
I can deal with lack of sleep.	Metumi adi nna a minni ho dwuma.
That’s what a team does.	Ɛno ne nea kuw bi yɛ.
He was a beautiful man.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
So does every other superpower.	Saa ara na tumi kɛse foforo biara nso yɛ.
This just happened.	Eyi sii ara kwa.
None of us are like that.	Yɛn mu biara nni hɔ a ɔte saa.
I just, the season was over.	Me kɛkɛ, na bere no aba awiei.
Not a tall man.	Ɛnyɛ ɔbarima tenten bi.
She was happy, she loved it.	Ná n’ani agye, na n’ani gye ho.
He is one of us.	Ɔyɛ yɛn mu biako.
But they really enjoyed it.	Nanso na wɔn ani gye ho ankasa.
Really excited!.	Anigye ankasa!.
He was in too much pain.	Ná ɔte yaw dodo.
That is the end of the matter.	Ɛno ne asɛm no awiei.
There was no end in sight.	Na awiei biara nni hɔ a ɛda adi.
And you know it.	Na wunim.
Was his speech long?	So na ne kasa tenten?
It is the best way.	Ɛyɛ ɔkwan a eye sen biara.
Maybe to you it just felt good.	Ebia wo fam no na ɛte nka sɛ eye ara kwa.
I'm kind of a.	Meyɛ ɔkwan bi so a.
However, many lie underwater.	Nanso, pii da nsu no ase.
Such good news.	Nsɛm pa a ɛte saa.
Most of the time, I enjoyed it.	Mpɛn pii no, m’ani gyee ho.
There was only one reason.	Ade biako pɛ na na enti ɛte saa.
This car is too expensive.	Saa kar yi bo yɛ den dodo.
That’s how it works.	Saa na ɛyɛ adwuma.
He made a face.	Ɔyɛɛ anim.
I knew this day would come.	Ná minim sɛ saa da yi bɛba.
We definitely have a great team.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ yɛwɔ kuw kɛse bi.
It’s not just a story.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm bi kɛkɛ.
He could talk about it.	Ná obetumi aka ho asɛm.
However, there was more to the story.	Nanso, na pii wɔ asɛm no mu.
It was the weekend.	Ná ɛyɛ dapɛn awiei.
There is nothing exciting.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ anigye.
There would be nothing left.	Anka biribiara nni hɔ bio.
I am not now.	Menyɛ mprempren.
You are no longer wonderful.	Wonyɛ nwonwa bio.
One has to remember why.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi kae nea enti a ɛte saa.
You know those people.	Wunim saa nkurɔfo no.
All of this information was previously available for many years.	Ná saa nsɛm yi nyinaa wɔ hɔ kan mfe pii.
When is it going to be? 	Bere bɛn na ɛyɛ?
I wanted to move more books.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mede nhoma pii kɔ baabi foforo.
They are good at that.	Wɔn ho akokwaw wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
You remembered.	Wokae.
It was a terrible story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ hu.
It’s much easier if you know how.	Sɛ wunim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a, ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
But it’s not as surprising as this.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nwonwa te sɛ eyi.
I have no idea.	Minni adwene biara.
But that thought was short-lived.	Nanso na saa adwene no yɛ bere tiaa mu de.
I couldn’t begin to say where.	Na mintumi mfi ase nka baabi a ɛwɔ.
She is a very nice person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
He wasn’t that great.	Na ɔnyɛ saa kɛse no.
There has never been such a story.	Asɛm biara nni hɔ a ɛte saa da.
Anyone can be one.	Obiara betumi ayɛ biako.
Eventually, she would tell him the whole story.	Awiei koraa no, na ɔbɛka asɛm no nyinaa akyerɛ no.
Sure enough, it was a powerful film.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, na ɛyɛ sini a tumi wom.
I always say that.	Meka saa bere nyinaa.
And it is still in this way.	Na ɛda so ara wɔ saa kwan yi so.
He was no longer a child.	Ná ɔnyɛ abofra bio.
Do it immediately.	Yɛ no ntɛm ara.
And so do many of us.	Na saa ara na yɛn mu pii yɛ saa.
You would have done the same.	Anka wobɛyɛ saa ara.
Language is a language.	Kasa yɛ kasa.
Is it good that you	So eye sɛ wo .
That would be perfect.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nea edi mũ.
A strange thing happened.	Asɛm bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii.
Thank you, man.	Meda wo ase, ɔbarima.
You are doing your part.	Woreyɛ wo fam de.
You just have to know how to do it right.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu sɛnea wobɛyɛ no yiye ara kwa.
Now everything is over.	Seesei biribiara aba awiei.
He had forgotten about it.	Ná ne werɛ afi ho asɛm.
Or whatever you all think would be best.	Anaasɛ nea mo nyinaa susuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ papa biara.
He just didn't seem to know how to play with children.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onnim sɛnea ɔne mmofra bedi agoru kɛkɛ.
He could play the game.	Ná obetumi adi agoru no.
That’s a lot of work.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma pii.
How will you come?	Wobɛyɛ dɛn aba?
Maybe a month or two.	Ebia ɔsram biako anaa abien.
I was surprised at how popular it was.	Sɛnea na nkurɔfo ani gye ho no yɛɛ me nwonwa.
He didn't know where to go.	Ná onnim baabi a ɔbɛkɔ.
It works, it all works.	Ɛyɛ adwuma, ne nyinaa yɛ adwuma.
But that comes with a price tag.	Nanso ɛno de bo bi ka ho.
The two pictures look very similar.	Mfonini abien no hwɛ sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
It’s good to do the work.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ adwuma no.
Let him follow us.	Ma onni yɛn akyi.
We have a great deal of work ahead of us.	Yɛwɔ adwuma kɛse bi wɔ yɛn anim.
THAT.	A.
I can’t even.	Mintumi mpo.
How can I deal with this.	Mɛyɛ dɛn adi eyi ho dwuma.
Man only had so many years to do good.	Onipa nyaa mfe pii saa a ɔde bɛyɛ papa nkutoo.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia.
Everyone of the same type, that is.	Obiara a ne su te saa ara, kyerɛ sɛ.
And he was a good one.	Na na ɔyɛ papa.
We are part of it.	Yɛyɛ ne fã.
People fell to the ground.	Nkurɔfo hwee fam.
There are no more people.	Nnipa biara nni hɔ bio.
Good for everyone.	Eye ma obiara.
It was never much.	Ná ɛnyɛ pii da.
There is no master plan.	Nhyehyɛe kɛse biara nni hɔ.
That would be terrible.	Ɛno bɛyɛ hu.
This has been terrible.	Eyi ayɛ hu.
The whole way.	Ɔkwan no nyinaa.
One day, no doubt.	Da koro, akyinnye biara nni ho.
Something for everyone.	Biribi ma obiara.
He showed her his.	Ɔde ne de kyerɛɛ no.
I can do no good here.	Mintumi nyɛ papa biara wɔ ha.
It’s not that hard.	Ɛnyɛ den saa.
This is what we live by.	Eyi so na yɛde tra ase.
I am far from alone in this.	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na mewɔ eyi mu koraa.
There are a few who will enjoy both.	Kakraa bi wɔ hɔ a wɔn ani begye abien no nyinaa ho.
More and more days like this.	Nna pii ne pii te sɛ eyi.
But this is not the case here.	Nanso eyi nte saa wɔ ha.
I got involved in work.	Mede me ho hyɛɛ adwuma mu.
He could have done it.	Ná obetumi ayɛ.
It’s a name you say.	Ɛyɛ din a woka.
I felt human again.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ onipa bio.
Time is money in this case.	Bere yɛ sika wɔ asɛm yi mu.
Except for his own.	Gye sɛ ɔno ankasa de.
And that, too, makes him happy.	Na ɛno nso ma n’ani gye.
I’m not sure how that applies.	Me nnim sɛnea ɛno fa ho.
More money this time.	Sika pii saa bere yi.
However, everyone knows.	Nanso, obiara nim.
It was someone.	Ná ɛyɛ obi.
So much more than that.	Enti pii sen saa.
However, many of us still don’t know how.	Nanso, yɛn mu pii da so ara nnim sɛnea wɔyɛ.
It looks pretty cool.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
But it certainly isn’t.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnte saa.
The excitement was overwhelming.	Ná anigye no yɛ kɛse.
It was not the most important information.	Ná ɛnyɛ nsɛm a ɛho hia sen biara.
I think either of them can win this season.	Misusuw sɛ wɔn mu biara betumi adi nkonim wɔ saa bere yi mu.
Water returned to normal after only two years.	Nsu san kɔɔ sɛnea na ɛte kan no wɔ mfe abien pɛ akyi.
He doesn’t do that.	Ɔnyɛ saa.
And we put them there.	Na yɛde wɔn too hɔ.
I don’t know what that’s about.	Minnim nea ɛno fa ho.
It just gets better.	Ɛyɛ yiye ara kwa.
This picture shows how animals live.	Saa mfonini yi kyerɛ sɛnea mmoa tra ase.
A long walk.	Nantew tenten bi.
The meeting lasted about two hours.	Nhyiam no dii bɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abien.
The monster’s head was almost missing.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na aboa kɛse no ti nni hɔ.
It’s very good.	Ɛyɛ papa paa.
Don’t make their job easy.	Mma wɔn adwuma nyɛ mmerɛw.
But it’s an interesting city.	Nanso ɛyɛ kurow a ɛyɛ anigye.
In terms of sexuality.	Wɔ nna ho.
I believe it will be possible.	Migye di sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
But that’s exactly what it wasn’t.	Nanso ɛno ara ne nea na ɛnte saa.
He should have worked on that.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
It was too much for us.	Ná ɛdɔɔso dodo ma yɛn.
He had to understand.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte ase.
And the legs solve the problem.	Na nan no di ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
I can’t imagine what he’s going to do with it.	Mintumi nsusuw nea ɔde bɛyɛ ho.
That’s what happened.	Ɛno ne nea esii.
I have one too.	Me nso mewɔ bi.
It doesn’t always work.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛyɛ adwuma.
This is by no means true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware ɔkwan biara so.
This is perfect timing.	Eyi yɛ bere a edi mũ.
It is a mistake that everyone may have made.	Ɛyɛ mfomso a ebia obiara adi.
Just the worst people.	Nnipa a wɔyɛ bɔne sen biara no ara kwa.
His eyes wide open.	N’ani so a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Most importantly for your children.	Nea ɛho hia sen biara no ma wo mma.
The day began to warm up.	Da no fii ase yɛɛ hyew.
I can’t hear these things.	Mintumi nte saa nneɛma yi.
Be sure to include plenty of pictures of your child, too.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wode wo ba no mfonini pii bɛka ho, nso.
It feels right at home.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ fie.
Only in three hands and feet.	Nsa ne nan abiɛsa nkutoo mu.
I think it’s right here.	Misusuw sɛ ɛwɔ ha yi ara.
The news shocked most of them.	Asɛm no maa wɔn mu dodow no ara ho dwiriw wɔn.
The water was heating up.	Ná nsu no reyɛ hyew.
I’m glad he’s with me.	M’ani agye sɛ ɔne me wɔ hɔ.
That means it’s true.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
His hand was reaching for my gun.	Ná ne nsa rekɔ me tuo no mu.
And yet here it is.	Na nanso ɛwɔ ha.
I’m interested in everything.	M’ani gye biribiara ho.
One of our best.	Yɛn a eye sen biara no mu biako.
We can talk about it right here.	Yebetumi aka ho asɛm wɔ ha yi ara.
You have to forget.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo werɛ fi.
His head was pounding.	Ná ne ti rebɔ.
Many people will actually use it.	Nnipa pii de bedi dwuma ankasa.
He was doing those things well.	Ná ɔreyɛ saa nneɛma no yiye.
I think it’s too hot.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ hyew dodo.
I know what it is.	Minim nea ɛyɛ.
I know about him, just.	Minim ne ho asɛm, kɛkɛ.
This can save you money quite a bit.	Eyi betumi ama wo sika akɔ akyiri koraa.
Not just today.	Ɛnyɛ nnɛ nkutoo.
He is the only one who lives.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔte ase.
He was at home.	Ná ɔwɔ fie.
Tell me that again.	Ka saa asɛm no bio kyerɛ me.
However, there is much more to do.	Nanso, pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
If it is cold at night, wear warm underwear.	Sɛ awɔw wom anadwo a, hyɛ ntade ase a ɛyɛ hyew.
It’s a little weird.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra.
You knew he was no problem.	Na wunim sɛ ɔnyɛ ɔhaw biara.
One day at that time.	Da koro saa bere no.
It’s not very clear at all.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛda hɔ yiye koraa.
We need to be thorough in that regard.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nea edi mũ wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
Great music and amazing acting.	Nnwom kɛse ne agoru a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It’s a very good story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a eye paa.
This will obviously be true	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi bɛyɛ nokware
I do feel for them.	Mete nka ma wɔn ampa.
He used to be one of those kids.	Ná ɔyɛ saa mmofra no mu biako kan.
Throughout the night, my mind is full.	Anadwo mũ no nyinaa, m’adwene yɛ ma.
Here is a picture of my house.	Me fie ho mfonini ni.
But we both love it.	Nanso yɛn baanu nyinaa ani gye ho.
Out of nothing comes something.	Biribiara nni hɔ mu na biribi fi ba.
You can create a new image.	Wubetumi ayɛ mfonini foforo.
It was surprisingly good.	Ná eye ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I'm on the front lines.	Mewɔ anim no so.
I wanted to know everything.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu biribiara.
It’s the painful truth.	Ɛyɛ nokware a ɛyɛ yaw no.
He wants to work for the club.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma ma kurow no.
What year is this?.	Afe bɛn na eyi yɛ?.
And part of me really wanted it.	Na na me fã bi pɛ ankasa.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
Things were scarce.	Ná nneɛma ho yɛ na.
Any help would be great.	Mmoa biara bɛyɛ kɛse.
I had a job to do.	Ná mewɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
It’s a great house.	Ɛyɛ ofie kɛse bi.
Everyone knows you do.	Obiara nim sɛ woyɛ saa.
He was a graphic designer in this industry.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ mfonini wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
This was not the case.	Ná eyi nte saa.
Don’t do anything but that.	Mma nyɛ hwee gye saa.
I know that face.	Minim saa anim no.
Everything will blow up here.	Biribiara bɛbɔ wɔ ha.
This furniture is very expensive.	Saa dan mu nneɛma yi bo yɛ den yiye.
He is afraid of me.	Ɔbɔ hu wɔ me ho.
The new caravan is fashionable now.	Kar foforo a wɔde fa nnipa no yɛ nea aba so mprempren.
Cars start moving again.	Kar ahorow fi ase tu bio.
Do your part and everything really will work out.	Yɛ wo fam de na biribiara ankasa bɛkɔ yiye.
I am as good as you are.	Meyɛ papa te sɛ wo.
That restructuring is not possible at this time.	Saa nhyehyɛe foforo no ntumi nyɛ yiye saa bere yi.
Mother was beautiful.	Ná Maame ho yɛ fɛ.
But that didn’t work.	Nanso ɛno anyɛ yiye.
But there is little else.	Nanso nneɛma foforo kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
After that, move on.	Ɛno akyi no, kɔ so.
I worked with you for years.	Me ne wo yɛɛ adwuma mfe pii.
It must be given.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde ma.
I have been using it for about a year.	Mede adi dwuma bɛyɛ afe biako ni.
His mother heard the same thing.	Ne maame nso tee saa.
He didn’t know why, either.	Na onnim nea enti a ɛte saa, nso.
The same is true of you.	Saa ara na wo mu nso.
There is nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
I have to say that it is not.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ ɛnte saa.
This is obviously a mistake.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi yɛ mfomso.
Those costs can be substantial.	Saa ka ahorow no betumi ayɛ kɛse.
That’s how it is and it should be.	Ɛte saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
He is alone here, in this room.	Ɔwɔ ha nkutoo, wɔ saa dan yi mu.
Or at least that’s how it feels.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na ɛte.
It seems hard enough.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ.
In other words, no big deal.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse biara.
Eventually, the child recovered.	Awiei koraa no, abofra no ho tɔɔ no.
That’s what the morning will be for.	Ɛno ne nea anɔpa no bɛyɛ ama.
The truth is painful.	Nokware no yɛ yaw.
The gun works.	Tuo no yɛ adwuma.
You need to think about that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw saa asɛm no ho.
The years since have been difficult for him.	Mfe a atwam fi saa bere no ayɛ den ama no.
Other people do it all the time.	Nnipa foforo yɛ saa bere nyinaa.
He has been working on the book for a long time.	Wayɛ nhoma no ho adwuma bere tenten ni.
A wonderful job.	Adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Mine has been good.	Me de no ayɛ papa.
In time in time means literally in time.	Wɔ bere mu wɔ bere mu no kyerɛ ankasa wɔ bere mu.
This, too, seemed quite plausible.	Eyi nso, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware koraa.
And you can’t do that.	Na worentumi nyɛ saa.
So, that’s the case with this book.	Enti, ɛte saa wɔ saa nhoma yi ho.
So you have a lot of resources at your disposal.	Enti wowɔ nneɛma pii a wubetumi de adi dwuma.
Simple but expensive food.	Aduan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw nanso ne bo yɛ den.
That's right, and.	Ɛte saa, ne.
He had no room to paint.	Ná onni baabi a ɔbɛyɛ mfonini.
I have it right now.	Mewɔ bi mprempren ara.
He ran out the door.	Ɔde mmirika fii ɔpon no ano.
It may get bigger before it gets better.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ kɛse ansa na ayɛ yiye.
I believe in them.	Migye wɔn di.
We moved through them.	Yɛde yɛn ho faa wɔn mu.
It’s a delicate situation.	Ɛyɛ tebea a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
He touches her hand.	Ɔde ne nsa ka ne nsa.
You are too passive.	Woyɛ obi a ɔnyɛ hwee dodo.
He was terrible.	Ná ne ho yɛ hu.
It's set up too well.	Wɔde asi hɔ yiye dodo.
That’s what the story is about.	Ɛno ne nea asɛm no fa ho.
I have a similar situation.	Mewɔ tebea a ɛte saa ara.
Or not any of them.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ wɔn mu biara.
In the past, this was my favorite movie.	Bere bi a atwam no, na eyi ne sini a m’ani gye ho paa.
There is so much to do.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
And if you do that.	Na sɛ woyɛ saa a.
However, things were not quite as they used to be.	Nanso, na nneɛma nkɔ sɛnea na ɛte kan no koraa.
He had taken everyone with him.	Ná ɔde obiara aka ne ho.
There was nothing else to do.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I have to think of something else.	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw biribi foforo ho.
I hear it.	Mete no.
It was very cheap.	Na ne bo yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
The job is hard.	Adwuma no yɛ den.
Now he knows better.	Seesei onim yiye.
Or what he was doing.	Anaasɛ nea na ɔreyɛ.
We need to do something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ biribi.
He absolutely loves socializing and is good with kids.	N’ani gye ho koraa sɛ ɔne nkurɔfo bɛbɔ na ɔne mmofra pa.
It was a completely new concept for me.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene foforo ma me koraa.
It’s too hot.	Ɛyɛ hyew dodo.
He doesn’t like these things.	Ɔmpɛ saa nneɛma yi.
Get out with him.	Fi adi ne no.
Use them for yourself.	Fa wɔn di dwuma.
His car was still there.	Ná ne kar no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
All in all, though, it was fantastic.	Nanso, ne nyinaa mu no, na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It was anything but kind of ordinary.	Ná ɛyɛ biribiara gye sɛ ɔkwan bi a ɛyɛ ɔkwan biara so.
All things that aren’t really real.	Nneɛma a ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa nyinaa.
I don't care what happened or what you're doing.	Nea esii anaa nea woreyɛ no mfa me ho.
His wife knew otherwise.	Ná ne yere nim sɛ ɛnte saa.
She tells him what she wants to hear.	Ɔka nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte no kyerɛ no.
They don’t have to be straight.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ tee.
You can’t reach these people.	Worentumi nkɔ saa nkurɔfo yi nkyɛn.
They’re the ones that really matter.	Wɔn na ɛho hia ankasa.
It wasn’t a mistake.	Ná ɛnyɛ mfomso.
He knew nothing of this.	Ná onnim eyi ho hwee.
Really complicated stuff.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ den ankasa.
It is not so.	Ɛnte saa.
When that was over, everything fell into place.	Bere a ɛno baa awiei no, biribiara hwee ase.
people are interested in it.	nkurɔfo ani gye ho.
And it was even better this time.	Na na ɛyɛ papa mpo saa bere yi.
I think you would be surprised at how many there are.	Misusuw sɛ dodow a ɛwɔ hɔ no bɛyɛ wo nwonwa.
I know it was good.	Minim sɛ na eye.
The table was set for dinner.	Wɔde pon no sii hɔ maa anwummere aduan.
There is no impersonation.	Nnipa a wɔyɛ wɔn ho sɛ wɔyɛ nnipa ho nhyehyɛe biara nni hɔ.
He hears the phone ring.	Ɔte sɛ telefon no rebɔ.
You know it’s a movie, so you immerse yourself in it a little bit.	Wunim sɛ ɛyɛ sini, enti wode wo ho hyɛ mu kakra.
Lots of songs.	Nnwom pii.
Consider another perspective.	Susuw adwene foforo ho hwɛ.
It’s hard to.	Ɛyɛ den.
A real problem.	Ɔhaw a ɛyɛ nokware.
It was gone now.	Ná akɔ mprempren.
I really had to be more careful.	Ankasa na ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye kɛse.
Over the next few days,	Wɔ nna kakraa a edi hɔ no mu no, .
He’s the one who made me.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ me.
It’s incredibly strange.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
None of this mentions language.	Eyi mu biara nka kasa ho asɛm.
I can’t believe it has happened.	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ aba.
Not just one that handles everything.	Ɛnyɛ biako a edi biribiara ho dwuma nkutoo.
All this time.	Saa bere yi nyinaa.
Even if you think it is, it probably isn’t.	Sɛ wususuw sɛ ɛte saa mpo a, ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
Your bad guys only start at midnight.	Wo nnipa bɔne no fi ase anadwo fã nkutoo.
No way.	Kwan biara nni hɔ.
Most people shared that view.	Ná nnipa dodow no ara wɔ saa adwene no bi.
You’ll be relieved.	Wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
He had his arms wrapped around him.	Ná ɔde ne nsa abɔ ne ho.
I can do anything for you.	Metumi ayɛ wo biribiara.
That’s the only thing.	Ɛno nkutoo ne asɛm no.
The man is so tall!	Ɔbarima no tenten paa!
His words were vague.	Ná ne nsɛm no mu nna hɔ.
This is not about dinner.	Eyi nyɛ anwummere aduan ho asɛm.
Water is very hard.	Nsu yɛ den yiye.
However, humans don’t.	Nanso, nnipa nyɛ saa.
Everything starts at home.	Biribiara fi ase wɔ fie.
Or so from the very first.	Anaasɛ saa fi nea edi kan koraa no.
That would be a slap in the face.	Ɛno bɛyɛ anim a wɔde bɛbɔ.
He quickly dropped his letter.	Ɔyɛɛ ntɛm de ne krataa no too hɔ.
That’s enough of a claim.	Ɛno ne asɛm a wɔka sɛ ɛdɔɔso.
This should never happen.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi ba da.
I don’t know him for sure.	Minnim no yiye.
There was music again.	Ná nnwom wɔ hɔ bio.
It will be added by my father.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea me papa de aka ho.
This only happened occasionally.	Ná eyi ba bere ne bere mu nkutoo.
He placed them on the table.	Ɔde wɔn too pon no so.
But these measures were not very successful.	Nanso saa nneɛma yi antumi anyɛ yiye kɛse.
Trust your child.	Fa wo ho to wo ba no so.
He was a handsome and powerful man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ na ɔwɔ tumi.
But he knew there was nothing else he could do.	Nanso na onim sɛ biribiara nni hɔ bio a obetumi ayɛ.
He worries about it.	Ɔhaw ne ho wɔ ho.
I’m really, really excited and happy for him.	M’ani agye ankasa, ankasa na m’ani agye ma no.
This dress is warm and sexy.	Saa atade yi yɛ hyew na ɛyɛ fɛ.
He is your only child.	Ɔno ne wo ba koro pɛ.
He knows us.	Onim yɛn.
He was a charming character.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a n’ani gye.
That’s part of the fun.	Ɛno ne anigye no fã.
It was three stories.	Ná ɛyɛ nsɛm abiɛsa.
He is our father.	Ɔno ne yɛn papa.
And it’s just that.	Na ɛyɛ saa ara kwa.
It is full of life.	Nkwa ahyɛ mu ma.
I need to know how you got involved with this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea wode wo ho hyɛɛ eyi mu.
Planning is very important.	Nhyehyɛe ho hia kɛse.
Do you want a girl or a boy?	Wopɛ abeawa anaa abarimaa?
The child did well.	Abofra no yɛɛ yiye.
But be careful.	Nanso hwɛ yiye.
This is where it gets interesting.	Eyi ne baabi a ɛyɛ anigye.
Do a new job.	Yɛ adwuma foforo.
No need to draw.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ mfonini.
And it works for life.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma ma nkwa.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
This was not possible in the present experiment.	Eyi antumi anyɛ yiye wɔ mprempren sɔhwɛ no mu.
Everyone has a story to tell.	Obiara wɔ asɛm bi a ɔbɛka ho asɛm.
Don’t ever, ever feel that way.	Mma nte nka saa da, da.
Maybe you’ll be involved.	Ebia wo nso wobɛka ho.
That’s how it should be.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
But he didn’t have to.	Nanso na enhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
You can, you absolutely can.	Wubetumi, wubetumi ayɛ koraa.
Time seemed nothing.	Ná bere te sɛ nea ɛnyɛ hwee.
This was common at the time.	Saa bere no na eyi yɛ ade a abu so.
Tell him the truth.	Ka nokware no kyerɛ no.
Speak to me, please.	Kasa kyerɛ me.
Maybe I'm doing this wrong.	Ebia na mereyɛ eyi bɔne.
And how it is.	Na sɛnea ɛte.
He really didn't care about anyone or anything.	Ná obiara anaa biribiara ho nhia no ankasa.
Whatever you ask him to do, he will do for you.	Biribiara a wobɛka akyerɛ no sɛ ɔnyɛ no, na ɔbɛyɛ ama wo.
He was interested in it.	Ná n’ani gye ho.
It’s like being in a picture book.	Ɛte sɛ nea wowɔ mfonini nhoma mu.
That makes it easier.	Ɛno ma ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
That may be the only thing you need to know.	Ebia ɛno nkutoo ne ade a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
However, I doubt if there are many children like you.	Nanso, migye kyim sɛ ebia mmofra te sɛ wo pii wɔ hɔ a.
Imagine that child is me.	Fa no sɛ saa abofra no yɛ me.
That is no longer an issue.	Ɛno nyɛ asɛm bio.
But they themselves didn’t seem to know any better.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ankasa nnim nea eye sen saa.
I thought maybe he was doing it for fun.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia na ɔreyɛ saa de agye n’ani.
I should have gone to the meeting.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ nhyiam no ase.
He just didn't know what to say.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛka kɛkɛ.
Maybe that’s me.	Ebia ɛno ne me.
If he is here, it is good.	Sɛ ɔwɔ ha a, eye.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani gye ho ankasa.
Maybe he was busy.	Ebia na onni adagyew.
There are few jobs here now.	Nnwuma kakraa bi na ɛwɔ ha mprempren.
The end is quick.	Awiei no yɛ ntɛm.
We have all known about the danger for a long time.	Yɛn nyinaa nim asiane no ho asɛm bere tenten ni.
I would have done the same.	Anka me nso mɛyɛ saa.
He is not wrong.	Ɔnyɛ mfomso.
Close my mind and leave.	To m’adwene mu na fi hɔ kɔ.
If they did, it would be easier.	Sɛ wɔyɛ saa a, anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Don’t use them all.	Mfa wɔn nyinaa nni dwuma.
A few things happened this week.	Nneɛma kakraa bi sii dapɛn yi.
This took several hours.	Eyi gyee nnɔnhwerew pii.
This would be easy.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ mmerɛw.
The power of what it is we can create.	Tumi a ɛwɔ nea ɛyɛ no mu no yebetumi abɔ.
However, it wasn’t.	Nanso, na ɛnte saa.
Start with two hours.	Fi ase de nnɔnhwerew abien.
But what happened out of sight was another matter.	Nanso na nea esii wɔ baabi a obiara nhu no yɛ asɛm foforo.
I wanted more than that.	Ná mepɛ pii sen saa.
I will bring them down.	Mede wɔn bɛba fam.
He was the most dangerous.	Ná ne ho yɛ hu sen biara.
That doesn’t mean everything else is always optimal.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ biribiara a aka no yɛ nea eye sen biara bere nyinaa.
He put his hand on hers.	Ɔde ne nsa too ne de no so.
He cycled into town.	Ɔde sakre kɔɔ kurow no mu.
John was knocked down by a car.	Kar bi bɔɔ John hwee fam.
But many species are endangered.	Nanso mmoa ahorow pii wɔ asiane mu.
That’s my situation.	Ɛno ne me tebea.
The industry is like that today.	Nnwuma no te saa nnɛ.
Think about this.	Susuw eyi ho hwɛ.
Where I’m focused.	Baabi a m’adwene wɔ so.
No one knows who did it or why.	Obiara nnim onii a ɔyɛɛ saa anaa nea enti a ɔyɛɛ saa.
You can do whatever it is.	Wubetumi ayɛ nea ɛte biara.
We glanced out the window.	Yɛde yɛn ani kyerɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu.
We are very passionate about something.	Yɛn ani gye biribi ho kɛse.
And we take it home.	Na yɛde kɔ fie.
That’s why.	Ɛno nti na.
That makes us two.	Ɛno ma yɛyɛ baanu.
He wanted to do whatever she wanted to do, but with him.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribiara a ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ, nanso ɔne no yɛ.
Maybe he just didn’t want to bother me anymore.	Ebia na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔhaw me bio kɛkɛ.
Every picture tells a story.	Mfonini biara ka asɛm bi.
However, each additional bus is very expensive.	Nanso, bɔs biara a wɔde bɛka ho no bo yɛ den yiye.
He was a squirrel.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔkraman.
Everything was there to be used.	Na biribiara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma.
There is no issue.	Asɛm biara nni hɔ.
Maybe there is something.	Ebia biribi wɔ hɔ.
Everything goes as it should.	Biribiara kɔ so sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no.
We do a variety of things.	Yɛyɛ nneɛma ahorow bi.
He has a.	Ɔwɔ a.
In my opinion, the situation was absolutely terrible.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no, na tebea no yɛ hu koraa.
The dog did not like the food.	Ná ɔkraman no ani nnye aduan no ho.
In my opinion much better.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no eye sen saa koraa.
I, I, I.	Me, me, me.
It’s not human, but it’s not animal either.	Ɛnyɛ onipa, nanso ɛnyɛ aboa nso.
So as a professional, he knew his stuff.	Enti sɛ́ obi a onim adwuma yiye no, na onim ne nneɛma.
I will continue to put one foot in front of the other.	Mɛkɔ so de me nan biako asi foforo anim.
And something else.	Na ade foforo nso.
We can’t let that happen.	Yɛrentumi mma saa asɛm no mma.
Many people were poor.	Ná nnipa pii di hia.
Nothing comes out.	Biribiara mfi adi.
And it works well in most cases.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye wɔ nsɛm dodow no ara mu.
It’s a new year.	Ɛyɛ afe foforo.
The man had one leg.	Ná ɔbarima no wɔ nan biako.
I’ve done things.	Mayɛ nneɛma.
He had a lot of them.	Ná ɔwɔ wɔn pii.
He did what they had to do.	Ɔyɛɛ nea na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
We both really enjoyed it.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa ani gyee ho paa.
But we are human beings.	Nanso yɛyɛ nnipa.
You are in a cell.	Wowɔ afiase dan bi mu.
But I doubt I can do this.	Nanso migye kyim sɛ metumi ayɛ eyi.
He was himself again.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔno ankasa bio.
I couldn’t imagine it.	Na mintumi nsusuw ho.
That’s just happening.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
One can see everything there.	Obi betumi ahu biribiara wɔ hɔ.
I am really looking forward to the game.	Mehwɛ agoru no kwan ankasa.
You don’t have to say a word.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woka asɛm biako mpo.
That was terrible for him.	Ná ɛno yɛ hu ma no.
There was a terrible situation.	Ná tebea bi a ɛyɛ hu wɔ hɔ.
It was a beautiful day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ fɛ.
And it was just so quick.	Na na ɛyɛ ntɛm ara kwa.
It’s pretty amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
I think you will like him very much.	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ne ho yiye.
Whatever it was.	Nea na ɛyɛ biara.
And that just got better.	Na ɛno yɛɛ yiye ara kwa.
What does it do for you?.	Dɛn na ɛyɛ ma wo?.
This year, there are surprises.	Afe yi, nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ hɔ.
It’s so nice.	Ɛte saa.
Unlike the game.	Ɛnte sɛ agoru no.
It works very well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye paa.
He must do a good job.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma pa.
However, this task is difficult.	Nanso, adwuma yi yɛ den.
Make no mistake, there is a lot of work to be done.	Nni mfomso, adwuma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Anyway, the picture.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, mfonini no.
We ended up with this monster.	Yɛde saa aboa kɛse yi baa awiei.
Look out here.	Hwɛ abɔnten wɔ ha.
This is just what works for me.	Eyi ne nea ɛyɛ adwuma ma me ara kwa.
I hit the whole thing hard.	Mede asɛm no nyinaa bɔɔ mu denneennen.
It’s good for him.	Eye ma no.
I believe in it.	Migye di wɔ ho.
And that may not be the only one.	Na ebia ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Many of them are some kind of layout plan or drawing.	Wɔn mu pii yɛ nhyehyɛe ho nhyehyɛe anaa mfonini bi.
The product is too easy to use.	Ade no yɛ mmerɛw dodo sɛ wɔde bedi dwuma.
That’s how hard it is.	Saa na ɛyɛ den.
I don’t know how to go about them.	Minnim sɛnea mɛkɔ wɔn so.
A really beautiful thing.	Ade a ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
He slipped out of it.	Ɔde ne ho fii mu.
You just have to tell them, that’s all.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka kyerɛ wɔn ara kwa, ɛno ara ne no.
This is a serious mistake.	Eyi yɛ mfomso kɛse.
We love movies.	Yɛn ani gye sini ho.
The kids loved it.	Mmofra no ani gyee ho.
It was like night from day.	Ná ɛte sɛ anadwo fi awia.
He was actually here.	Ná ɔwɔ ha ankasa.
He actually did it, so he did it.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ no ​​ankasa, enti ɔyɛɛ saa.
The result is that.	Nea afi mu aba ne sɛ.
He had a job to do.	Ná ɔwɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
And maybe it’s a good thing he doesn’t.	Na ebia ɛyɛ ade pa a ɔnyɛ.
I know you want some.	Minim sɛ wopɛ bi.
It’s not too old.	Ɛnyɛ nea akyɛ dodo.
That in itself is pretty common for a big city.	Ɛno ankasa yɛ nea abu so yiye ma kurow kɛse bi.
He argues with her all the time.	Ɔne no gye akyinnye bere nyinaa.
This should have been his.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ ne de.
Time would do with the people.	Ná bere bɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ nnipa no.
But so are many children.	Nanso mmofra pii nso te saa ara.
One day, with no problems.	Da koro, a ɔhaw biara nni ho.
He speaks three languages.	Ɔka kasa ahorow abiɛsa.
Most people didn’t.	Nnipa dodow no ara anyɛ saa.
He was not here for them.	Ná onni ha mma wɔn.
Stay as solid as ever.	Kɔ so yɛ nea ɛyɛ den sɛnea na ɛte kan no.
You know he will do it himself.	Wunim sɛ ɔno ankasa bɛyɛ.
Finally, there is what is.	Awiei koraa no, nea ɛwɔ hɔ no wɔ hɔ.
At least that was true.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛno yɛ nokware.
I would have done the same.	Anka me nso meyɛ saa ara.
Every day really.	Da biara da ankasa.
The nice thing is being part of a team.	Ade a ɛyɛ anigye ne sɛ wobɛyɛ kuw bi fã.
It wasn't like him at all.	Ná ɛnte sɛ ɔno koraa.
They were beautiful people.	Ná wɔyɛ nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
Approach.	Kwan.
The prospects are very strong.	Anidaso no mu yɛ den yiye.
Don’t mistake a ‘job’ for your ‘self’.	Mfa mfomso mfa ‘dwuma’ bi nyɛ wo ‘ankasa’.
Please take a moment to tell me your favorite.	Mesrɛ wo gye bere tiaa bi ka nea w’ani gye ho kɛse kyerɛ me.
And they tell us we can’t handle it.	Na wɔka kyerɛ yɛn sɛ yɛrentumi nni ho dwuma.
There are many good books.	Nhoma pa pii wɔ hɔ.
Not on the first day.	Ɛnyɛ da a edi kan no.
However, it is very complex and expensive.	Nanso, ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den yiye na ne bo yɛ den.
A lot of people go through things like this.	Nnipa pii fa nneɛma te sɛ eyi mu.
Home again, home again.	Fie bio, fie bio.
But this does not seem to be the case.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea eyi nte saa.
I might as well tell you.	Ebia mɛka akyerɛ wo saa ara.
Just not yet, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ de besi nnɛ kɛkɛ, ɔkwan biara so.
I wouldn't be very good at it.	Anka menyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw kɛse wɔ mu.
I didn’t have to tell him.	Na enhia sɛ meka kyerɛ no.
That was no issue.	Ná ɛno nyɛ asɛm biara.
Look at how he looks.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɔte.
More and more cases seem to be brought in every day.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔde nsɛm pii ba da biara da.
We’ll be fine.	Yɛbɛyɛ yiye.
He wasn't that young anymore.	Ná ɔnyɛ abofra saa bio.
It's all about what's convenient for me.	Ne nyinaa fa nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw ma me no ho.
As was most of the rest of the story.	Sɛnea na asɛm no fã a aka no fã kɛse no ara te no.
It seemed like a long time ago.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
In name, they are identical.	Wɔ din mu no, wɔyɛ pɛ.
It was all absolutely terrifying.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ hu koraa.
The game must be played in pairs.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde nnipa baanu di agoru no.
I don’t need to know anymore.	Ɛho nhia sɛ mihu bio.
You can say a lot.	Wubetumi aka pii.
He was gone most of the day.	Ná onni hɔ da no fã kɛse no ara.
It’s not that common.	Ɛnyɛ nea abu so saa.
A group of children did poorly in school.	Mmofra kuw bi anyɛ adwuma yiye wɔ sukuu mu.
It’s a terrible road.	Ɛyɛ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu.
Not so says the latter is wrong.	Ɛnte saa ka sɛ nea etwa to no di mfomso.
Look, it’s just a matter of time.	Hwɛ, ɛyɛ bere ho asɛm ara kwa.
The best we can.	Nea eye sen biara a yebetumi.
And I can’t do it.	Na mintumi nyɛ.
It was a beautiful morning.	Ná ɛyɛ anɔpa a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Go to all views.	Kɔ hwɛ nyinaa so.
But it was the best we could do.	Nanso na ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara a yebetumi ayɛ.
Children should play outside whenever possible.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra di agoru wɔ abɔnten bere biara a ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
And this isn’t necessarily a bad thing.	Na eyi nyɛ ade bɔne ankasa.
And yet that was important.	Na nanso na ɛno ho hia.
You can easily get a great head with this project.	Wubetumi anya ti kɛse a ɛnyɛ den wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
I look forward to it more than probably anyone else on the team.	Mehwɛ kwan sen ebia obiara a ɔwɔ kuw no mu.
He had a few days left.	Ná ɔwɔ nna kakraa bi a aka.
There is no book.	Nhoma bi nni hɔ.
Who is that person?	Hena ne saa onipa no?
It’s a real job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ankasa.
An interesting story.	Asɛm bi a ɛyɛ anigye.
I just love what it is.	M'ani gye nea ɛyɛ ho ara kwa.
If this feels too hard, just go from what you can.	Sɛ eyi te nka sɛ ɛyɛ den dodo a, fi nea wubetumi ayɛ ara kwa.
But trust me, this is important.	Nanso gye me di, eyi ho hia.
That seemed possible.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛno betumi aba.
However, it is.	Nanso, ɛte saa.
It has years, you can tell.	Ɛwɔ mfe, wubetumi ahu.
It’s their opinion.	Ɛyɛ wɔn adwene.
The experiment was successful.	Sɔhwɛ no dii yiye.
Or if there is anyone.	Anaasɛ sɛ obi wɔ hɔ a.
But keep doing what you’re doing.	Nanso kɔ so yɛ nea woreyɛ no.
Your time is up.	Wo bere atwam.
No more house wife for me.	Ofie yere biara nni hɔ bio mma me.
Put yourself in a crisis.	Fa wo ho hyɛ ɔhaw bi mu.
And he wasn’t alone.	Na ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
Surely there is a better system.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nhyehyɛe bi wɔ hɔ a eye sen eyi.
Everyone should watch this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara hwɛ eyi.
This time it’s here for the kids too.	Saa bere yi deɛ ɛwɔ ha ma mmofra no nso.
For two products, .	Wɔ nneɛma abien a wɔyɛ ho no, .
You may be really busy.	Ebia wowɔ adagyew ankasa.
I think about it a lot in the background.	Misusuw ho pii wɔ akyi hɔ.
Not much going on there.	Ɛnyɛ pii na ɛrekɔ so wɔ hɔ.
There was an error in the document.	Mfomso bi sii wɔ krataa no mu.
This is a remarkable one.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa.
He placed the last item on his desk.	Ɔde ade a etwa to no too ne pon so.
I should be more important than that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ho hia me sen saa.
But it’s what we have.	Nanso ɛyɛ nea yɛwɔ.
This statement shocked everyone.	Saa asɛm yi maa obiara ho dwiriw no.
If he didn’t want to do something, he didn’t.	Sɛ na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi a, na ɔnyɛ.
And neither do schools.	Na sukuu ahorow nso nyɛ saa.
There were few details on the ground.	Ná nsɛm kakraa bi na ɛwɔ fam.
I work at my day job.	Meyɛ adwuma wɔ me da adwuma mu.
And there are some very strange things in this.	Na nneɛma bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye wɔ eyi mu.
It was a dangerous game.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a asiane wom.
But that may not be true.	Nanso ebia na ɛno nyɛ nokware.
In the short term, however, this is now highly unlikely.	Nanso bere tiaa mu no, mprempren eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye koraa.
This seems to work well.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ adwuma yiye.
But you knew that.	Nanso na wunim saa.
Maybe both were true.	Ebia na abien no nyinaa yɛ nokware.
It seems like a long time ago.	Ɛte sɛ nea bere tenten a atwam ni.
Several friends visited us last week.	Nnamfo pii baa yɛn nkyɛn dapɛn a etwaam no.
He headed for the door.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ɔpon no ano.
More on that later.	Ɛno ho nsɛm pii bɛba akyiri yi.
Much remains to be done.	Nneɛma pii da so ara hia sɛ wɔyɛ.
It had been given to me.	Ná wɔde ama me.
But apparently no one needs him.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ obiara nhia no.
He’s been very excited about it.	N’ani agye ho paa.
I didn’t really want the truth.	Ná mempɛ nokware no ankasa.
But not very often.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii.
I just can’t find any.	Mintumi nnya biara kɛkɛ.
We made the most of every moment.	Yɛde bere biara dii dwuma yiye.
It is a very expensive car.	Ɛyɛ kar a ne bo yɛ den yiye.
You obviously want something from me.	Ɛda adi sɛ wopɛ biribi fi me hɔ.
I don't know if this will be a problem.	Minnim sɛ ebia eyi bɛyɛ ɔhaw anaa.
But that wasn’t all there was.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
All the money is gone.	Sika no nyinaa akɔ.
The water is hot	Nsu a ɛyɛ hyew
However, I didn’t have to.	Nanso, na enhia sɛ meyɛ saa.
They had been given enough money.	Ná wɔde sika a ɛdɔɔso ama wɔn.
There was no reason left in him.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a enti na aka wɔ ne mu.
That would be a huge undertaking.	Ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
We also enjoyed the food.	Yɛn nso yɛn ani gyee aduan no ho.
You see a few pictures of him.	Wuhu ne ho mfonini kakraa bi.
I almost knew it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na minim.
I hurried to my house.	Meyɛɛ ntɛm kɔɔ me fie.
No one really knows for sure.	Obiara nnim no yiye ankasa.
The highway will be busy.	Ɔkwan kɛse no bɛyɛ nea nnipa pii fa so.
. . . .	.
But he is in the city.	Nanso ɔwɔ kurow no mu.
It was true.	Ná ɛyɛ nokware.
It didn’t matter to me.	Ná ɛnyɛ me asɛm.
It’s still good.	Ɛda so ara yɛ papa.
That’s not what happened here.	Ɛnyɛ saa na esii wɔ ha.
Take them with you.	Fa wɔn ka wo ho.
It has to be the other way around.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔkwan foforo so.
Like the other thing.	Te sɛ ade foforo no.
He did so reluctantly.	Ɔyɛɛ saa a na ɔmpɛ.
But it is much more than that.	Nanso ɛyɛ pii sen saa.
If so, it isn’t.	Sɛ ɛte saa a, ɛnyɛ saa.
Not even their own people.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn ankasa nkurɔfo mpo.
The children did so.	Mmofra no yɛɛ saa.
It was immediately apparent.	Na ɛda adi ntɛm ara.
All but the bed.	Ne nyinaa gye mpa no nkutoo.
He looked down at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ fam.
The walk was generally in good shape.	Mpɛn pii no na nantew no wɔ tebea pa mu.
You really enjoyed it.	W’ani gyee ho ankasa.
I can’t let him go.	Mintumi mma no nkɔ.
That’s something you need to know.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
I can’t get enough of it.	Mintumi nnya nea ɛdɔɔso.
I saw it all.	Mihuu ne nyinaa.
Everyone will believe him.	Obiara begye no adi.
Thank you, guys.	Meda mo ase.
I get that.	Me nsa ka saa.
I saw him again.	Mihuu no bio.
I think about my children.	Misusuw me mma ho.
Fortunately, the kids had a plan.	Nea eye ne sɛ na mmofra no wɔ nhyehyɛe bi.
It’s a thing.	Ɛyɛ ade bi.
Anyway, that's it for now.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛno ne no mprempren.
However, it wasn’t at all.	Nanso, na ɛnte saa koraa.
Everything else went out the window at that point.	Biribiara a aka no fii mfɛnsere no mu saa bere no.
He seemed to be.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ.
But he was here.	Nanso na ɔwɔ ha.
A very long time.	Bere tenten paa.
I don’t know myself.	Minnim me ho.
There was too much at stake.	Ná nneɛma pii dodo ho asɛm wɔ ho.
But that was many years ago now.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ mfe pii a atwam ni mprempren.
I am here, with the story.	Mewɔ ha, ne asɛm no.
It’s a really good thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a eye ankasa.
It was lunch time.	Ná ɛyɛ awia aduan bere.
This is really interesting.	Eyi yɛ anigye ankasa.
What can I do about it.	Dɛn na metumi ayɛ.
But that doesn’t seem to be the problem here.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ ɛno ne ɔhaw a ɛwɔ ha.
Not all that really matters.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno nyinaa na ɛho hia ankasa.
Most people want every new year to be the best.	Nnipa dodow no ara pɛ sɛ afe foforo biara yɛ nea eye sen biara.
We cannot say that there is really only one way.	Yɛrentumi nka sɛ ɔkwan biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Except for just one.	Gye biako pɛ.
I can make it hard.	Metumi ama ayɛ den.
He wanted it bad.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne.
I'd better get used to it.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ mɛyɛ me su.
The obvious statement.	Asɛm a ɛda adi.
Great job for both of you.	Adwuma kɛse ma mo baanu nyinaa.
The same goes for his money.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ ne sika a ɔwɔ no ho.
See if he can get there.	Hwɛ sɛ obetumi akɔ hɔ anaa.
Both ways are not good.	Ɔkwan abien no nyinaa nyɛ papa.
That was huge for me.	Ná ɛno yɛ kɛse ma me.
I knew nothing about him at the time.	Ná minnim ne ho hwee saa bere no.
First, you need to consider what it is.	Nea edi kan no, ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw nea ɛyɛ ho.
I was shocked too.	Me nso me ho dwiriw me.
They are used for play.	Wɔde yɛ agoru.
So my kids say.	Enti me mma no ka sɛ.
You can’t do anything alone.	Wo nkutoo ntumi nyɛ biribiara.
An empty road lies ahead.	Ɔkwan bi a hwee nni so da anim.
Not that he wanted to.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
He was very good.	Ná ɔyɛ papa paa.
You are all beautiful.	Mo nyinaa ho yɛ fɛ.
Two things hit me hard.	Nneɛma abien bɔɔ me denneennen.
But there was one problem with this idea.	Nanso na ɔhaw biako wɔ saa adwene yi ho.
Our interest in those things is similar.	Nea yɛn ani gye ho wɔ saa nneɛma no mu no te saa ara.
But you can do this for me.	Nanso wubetumi ayɛ eyi ama me.
And they were good.	Na wɔyɛ papa.
He wasn’t supposed to talk to them.	Na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔne wɔn kasa.
I'll give you a letter.	Mede krataa bi bɛma wo.
Get out of jail that way.	Fi afiase saa kwan no so.
This house is part of us.	Saa ofie yi yɛ yɛn fã.
But he could also act.	Nanso na obetumi ayɛ agoru nso.
He got his chance too.	Ɔno nso nyaa ne hokwan.
The game should work as a story.	Ɛsɛ sɛ agoru no yɛ adwuma sɛ asɛm.
He seems to think it’s smart.	Ɛte sɛ nea osusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nyansa.
He pointed his hand at my head.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ me ti so.
We have some time though.	Yɛwɔ bere kakra de, nanso.
This is what he wanted.	Eyi ne nea na ɔpɛ.
But give me a few words.	Nanso ma me nsɛm kakraa bi.
These things were new to me.	Ná saa nneɛma yi yɛ ade foforo ma me.
And you probably know why.	Na ebia wunim nea enti a ɛte saa.
It’s that easy for me.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa ma me.
We both knew what he was going to do with it.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa nim nea ɔde bɛyɛ.
The cars go through a city gate.	Kar ahorow no fa kurow no pon bi mu.
Maybe it’s just too new.	Ebia ɛyɛ foforo dodo ara kwa.
You are not working on the project alone.	Ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo na woreyɛ adwuma no ho adwuma.
He doesn’t want her now, not this way.	Ɔmpɛ no mprempren, ɛnyɛ saa kwan yi so.
You know that you.	Wunim sɛ wo.
Just a little bit.	Kakraa bi kɛkɛ.
He knew it was no picture.	Ná onim sɛ ɛnyɛ mfonini biara.
I know this can’t be what you wanted.	Minim sɛ eyi ntumi nyɛ nea na wopɛ.
One dog gets out and another dog gets involved.	Ɔkraman biako fi adi na ɔkraman foforo nso de ne ho hyɛ mu.
Be careful, too.	Hwɛ yiye.
He is with his will.	Ɔne ne pɛ.
It was so much fun doing it.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye kɛse sɛ mɛyɛ no saa.
So only the first issue is before us.	Enti asɛm a edi kan no nkutoo na ɛwɔ yɛn anim.
There seems to be nothing.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara nnim.
It’s not very surprising.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa kɛse.
I don’t know why that is.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Now everything is behind schedule.	Seesei biribiara aka akyi.
Your situation may be difficult.	Ebia wo tebea bɛyɛ den.
He is all his own.	Ɔno nyinaa yɛ ne de.
That’s the best we can do.	Ɛno ne nea eye sen biara a yebetumi ayɛ.
The city was vibrant.	Ná kurow no yɛ nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ hyew.
The day was a blur.	Ná da no yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
He is not the man he used to be.	Ɔnyɛ ɔbarima a na ɔyɛ kan no.
It was cold.	Ná awɔw wom.
We are weak.	Yɛyɛ mmerɛw.
He had me, and he knew it.	Ná ɔwɔ me, na na onim.
There are elements of that.	Ɛno mu nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ.
But it was over.	Nanso na aba awiei.
The movie started.	Sini no fii ase.
She is beautiful inside and out.	Ɔyɛ fɛ wɔ ne mu ne akyi.
Everyone else runs.	Obiara a aka no tu mmirika.
It’s not the best.	Ɛnyɛ nea eye sen biara.
It looked fresh.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ foforo.
It was a big part of it.	Na ɛyɛ ne fã kɛse.
It was my opinion.	Ná ɛyɛ m’adwene.
I can take us there.	Metumi de yɛn akɔ hɔ.
In order to be used.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wɔde bedi dwuma.
He is with her, too.	Ɔne no nso ka ho.
Simple music, but still.	Nnwom a ɛnyɛ den, nanso ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
He didn’t have to tell himself that.	Na enhia sɛ ɔka saa kyerɛ ne ho.
Everyone is trying their best.	Obiara rebɔ mmɔden biara a obetumi.
Which is a kind of.	Nea ɛyɛ ɔkwan bi so.
Movie.	Sini.
It had been a great year for him.	Ná ayɛ afe kɛse ama no.
I'm just here.	Mete ha ara kwa.
They both nodded to him.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa de wɔn ti too fam kyerɛɛ no.
We are on the right track.	Yɛwɔ ɔkwan pa so.
It looked pretty cool.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I think you know.	Misusuw sɛ wunim.
I need to tell him something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribi kyerɛ no.
The reason is immediately obvious.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no da adi ntɛm ara.
That happened years ago.	Ɛno sii mfe bi a atwam ni.
He never would have done it without her.	Sɛ ɔno nni hɔ a, anka ɔnyɛ saa da.
I want him to tell me that day means everything.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ me sɛ saa da no kyerɛ biribiara.
I can’t believe he’s doing this.	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɔreyɛ eyi.
It wasn’t even a pleasant day.	Ná ɛnyɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye mpo.
And you can see that in the room.	Na wubetumi ahu saa wɔ dan no mu.
This took a lot of trouble.	Eyi gyee ɔhaw kɛse.
That’s just a problem.	Ɛno yɛ ɔhaw bi kɛkɛ.
I know that little bit.	Minim saa kakra no.
We could have traveled now.	Anka yebetumi atu kwan mprempren.
I can’t let you go.	Mintumi mma wo nkɔ.
I prefer this approach.	Mepɛ saa kwan yi.
Nearly half the city was unemployed.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na kurow no fã nni adwuma.
I would like some water, please.	Mesrɛ wo, mepɛ nsu bi.
I just used the latter this morning.	Mede nea etwa to no dii dwuma anɔpa yi ara kwa.
But it was perfect.	Nanso na ɛyɛ pɛ.
It was the face of a man.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔbarima bi anim.
I think we can.	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi.
But that’s the way it is.	Nanso saa na ɛte.
Good morning to you.	Anɔpa pa ma wo.
He didn’t like any part of it.	Ná n’ani nnye ne fã biara ho.
Every one of us just has to approach this day.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn mu biara kɛkɛ de saa da yi bɛn.
But two other factors will also be crucial.	Nanso nneɛma abien foforo nso bɛyɛ nea ɛho hia kɛse.
People trusted him.	Nkurɔfo de wɔn ho too no so.
If anyone could, it would be him.	Sɛ obi betumi a, anka ɛbɛyɛ ɔno.
I don’t even know whose idea it was.	Minnim mpo sɛ na ɛyɛ hena adwene.
I kept my eyes on him.	Mede m’ani sii no so.
For the person.	Wɔ obi no fam no.
It’s not something that’s real.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nokware.
I don’t like him here.	M’ani nnye ne ho wɔ ha.
I’ve always been very impressed with him.	M’ani gye ne ho kɛse bere nyinaa.
He had no idea what was going on.	Ná onni nea ɛrekɔ so no ho adwene biara.
Or to touch him.	Anaasɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa bɛka no.
He can be them and do anything with them.	Obetumi ayɛ wɔn na ɔne wɔn ayɛ biribiara.
One at a time.	Biako wɔ bere bi mu.
Water runs all the time.	Nsu tu mmirika bere nyinaa.
I told him not to.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
Mom, show me the way.	Maame, kyerɛ me kwan.
You're right, probably.	Woayɛ no yiye, ebia.
The car definitely has some power.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ kar no wɔ tumi bi.
I could have used that last week.	Anka metumi de saa adi dwuma dapɛn a etwaam no.
Go and do that.	Kɔ na yɛ saa.
They both needed more.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa hia pii.
You want another one, he says.	Ɔka sɛ, wopɛ foforo.
I liked it even more than the first one.	M’ani gyee ho sen nea edi kan no mpo.
He doesn’t want me.	Ɔmpɛ me.
I had no phone bills.	Ná minni telefon so sika biara.
I really hope so.	Mewɔ anidaso ankasa sɛ ɛte saa.
I just love it.	M’ani gye ho ara kwa.
It is not a priority.	Ɛnyɛ ade a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde di kan.
You both just know.	Mo baanu nyinaa nim ara kwa.
That would be awesome if you could do that.	Ɛno bɛyɛ hu sɛ wubetumi ayɛ saa a.
He seemed to be a completely different person.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ onipa foforo koraa.
This took him a long time to do.	Eyi gyee no bere tenten ansa na wayɛ.
She is just beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ ara kwa.
He doesn’t have time for this.	Onni bere mma eyi.
Be really careful.	Hwɛ yiye ankasa.
We can’t know anything about him at all.	Yɛrentumi nhu ne ho asɛm biara koraa.
The problem continues.	Ɔhaw no kɔ so.
On both days.	Wɔ nna abien no nyinaa mu.
He spends a lot of time there.	Ɔde bere pii tra hɔ.
You have to realize that you have a lot of opportunities.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu sɛ wowɔ hokwan pii.
That in itself is awesome, in my opinion.	Ɛno ankasa yɛ hu, wɔ m’adwene mu.
He feels much happier now.	Ɔte nka sɛ n’ani agye kɛse mprempren.
The offer had been given with some care.	Ná wɔde nea wɔde ama no no ahwɛ yiye kakra.
The result looks like the book to me.	Nea afi mu aba no te sɛ nhoma no ma me.
I owe you both a lot for that.	Mede mo baanu nyinaa ka pii wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
A past work.	Adwuma bi a atwam.
It shouldn’t be my business.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ me asɛm.
He was a powerful man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔwɔ tumi.
This was pretty amazing.	Ná eyi yɛ nwonwa yiye.
He was focused on me.	Ná ɔde n’adwene asi me so.
The gun found the target.	Tuo no huu nea wɔde wɔn ani asi so no.
It’s not the same thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade koro no ara.
Most events serve lunch and dinner.	Nhyiam ahorow no mu dodow no ara ma awia ne anwummere aduan.
He didn't like that at all.	Ná n’ani nnye saa asɛm no ho koraa.
Lots of awesome work.	Adwuma a ɛyɛ hu pii.
Take the house below.	Fa fie a ɛwɔ ase hɔ no kɔ.
The best thing about it is that it is incredibly simple.	Ade a eye sen biara wɔ ho ne sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Again, nothing happened.	Bio nso, biribiara amma.
That was a terrible mistake.	Ná ɛno yɛ mfomso a ɛyɛ hu.
He really seems to be getting bigger.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔreyɛ kɛse ankasa.
The rest were gone.	Ná wɔn a aka no nni hɔ bio.
It was your book.	Ná ɛyɛ wo nhoma.
Anyone who just wanted to hear some music .	Obiara a na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte nnwom bi kɛkɛ .
Just look at them now!	Hwɛ wɔn kɛkɛ mprempren!
Not all water is essential for life.	Ɛnyɛ nsu nyinaa na ɛho hia ma nkwa.
This is a simple and quick way.	Eyi yɛ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ ntɛm.
I love that boy.	M’ani gye saa abarimaa no ho.
See if you can identify the underlying pain.	Hwɛ sɛ wubetumi ahu yaw a ɛwɔ ase no anaa.
If you want to, you will.	Sɛ wopɛ a, wobɛyɛ saa.
He had something that looked like a thick piece of paper.	Ná ɔwɔ biribi a ɛte sɛ krataa a ɛyɛ den.
It was a big deal at the time.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse saa bere no.
Or busy hands.	Anaasɛ nsa a adagyew nnim.
People were interested in us.	Ná nkurɔfo ani gye yɛn ho.
I had no idea it would be so beautiful.	Ná minni adwene biara sɛ ɛbɛyɛ fɛ saa.
I am incredibly worried about you.	Wo ho haw me wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
This is one of the good ones.	Eyi yɛ papa no mu biako.
We can’t do that.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
So they give it to each other.	Enti wɔde ma wɔn ho wɔn ho.
It is a powerful part of the language though.	Ɛyɛ kasa no fã a tumi wom nanso.
Again you will be cold.	Bio nso wobɛyɛ awɔw.
They must be perfect.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ pɛ.
I just want to say this.	Mepɛ sɛ meka eyi kɛkɛ.
But in a different way.	Nanso wɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
This is absolutely huge.	Eyi yɛ kɛse koraa.
Similar problems are involved.	Ɔhaw ahorow a ɛte saa ara ka ho.
It will be the same.	Ɛbɛyɛ saa ara.
It is our will to give our opinion.	Ɛyɛ yɛn pɛ sɛ yɛde yɛn adwene bɛma.
It’s what he does.	Ɛyɛ nea ɔyɛ.
There is no help there.	Mmoa biara nni hɔ wɔ hɔ.
I didn’t know what to do with him.	Ná minnim nea menyɛ wɔ ne ho.
I think it’s his father who has the really big money.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ ne papa na ɔwɔ sika kɛse ankasa no.
His head nodded slightly.	Ne ti de ne ti too fam kakra.
Do you really believe that?	So wugye di saa ampa?
This trend will continue for many more years.	Saa kwan yi bɛkɔ so mfe pii bio.
I’m not sure what’s best.	Me ntumi nhu nea eye sen biara.
He placed them on the table.	Ɔde wɔn too pon no so.
The view is a wonderful thing.	Adwene no yɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He didn't even have to say much that way.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔka pii mpo saa kwan no so.
This was not surprising at all.	Ná eyi nyɛ nwonwa koraa.
I want to be real.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ obi ankasa.
This meant we could make a lot of money.	Ná eyi kyerɛ sɛ yebetumi anya sika pii.
First impressions are everything.	Adwene a edi kan ne biribiara.
It contains information about the meeting.	Ɛwɔ nhyiam no ho nsɛm.
Nothing like that, ever again.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa, bio da.
Everything that follows is true.	Biribiara a edi akyi no yɛ nokware.
But they were amazing and so was the room.	Nanso na wɔyɛ nwonwa na na dan no nso yɛ nwonwa.
This is a very bad time.	Eyi yɛ bere bɔne paa.
I would have to agree with you there.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo yɛ adwene wɔ hɔ.
I had a hunch something was wrong.	Ná mewɔ adwene bi sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye.
It’s a temporary one.	Ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi.
You were planning to see him.	Ná woreyɛ nhyehyɛe ahu no.
And go for it.	Na kɔ.
Say each word aloud several times.	Ka asɛm biara den mpɛn pii.
I like it this way.	M’ani gye ho saa kwan yi so.
During the year, many things have happened.	Wɔ afe no mu no, nneɛma pii asi.
His gaze was contemplative.	Ná n’ani a ɔde hwɛ ade no yɛ nea ɛyɛ adwene.
I don’t want you to know.	Mempɛ sɛ wuhu.
I don’t like it very much.	M’ani nnye ho kɛse.
Everything happened at the same time.	Biribiara sii bere koro mu.
You and your that animal.	Wo ne wo saa mmoa no.
It was all a lie	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ atoro
I can talk.	Metumi kasa.
The police did not find him.	Polisifo no anhu no.
There is no hope for us.	Anidaso biara nni hɔ mma yɛn.
That’s going to happen.	Ɛno bɛba.
If there is, it is good.	Sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ a, eye.
He had a plan, and he would continue to do so.	Ná ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe bi, na na ɔbɛkɔ so ayɛ saa.
Nor should we do that.	Saa ara nso na ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Reassess your priorities.	San susuw nneɛma a wode di kan no ho.
Each of them has their own potential.	Wɔn mu biara wɔ nea obetumi ayɛ.
He is a thing of the past.	Ɔyɛ ade a atwam.
So tell me a little about yourself.	Enti ka wo ho asɛm kakra kyerɛ me.
I think a lot of people don’t get the book.	Misusuw sɛ nnipa pii nnya nhoma no.
He just wanted everyone to be vigilant.	Nea na ɔpɛ ara ne sɛ obiara ani da hɔ.
He would go down.	Ná ɔbɛkɔ fam.
You can see how happy this has made him.	Wubetumi ahu sɛnea eyi ama n’ani agye.
He was late for work.	Ná aka akyi wɔ adwuma mu.
This task was relatively easy.	Ná adwuma yi yɛ mmerɛw kakra.
What do you think of that?	Dɛn na wususuw wɔ saa asɛm no ho?
Go back immediately.	San kɔ ntɛm ara.
Nobody does it better.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ no yiye sen saa.
You can be great again and you will be great again.	Wubetumi ayɛ kɛse bio na wobɛyɛ kɛse bio.
He is the leading man of the film.	Ɔno ne ɔbarima a odi sini no anim.
We’ll give it to you tomorrow.	Yɛde bɛma wo ɔkyena.
Or he will surrender.	Anaasɛ ɔde ne ho bɛma.
It’s full of stuff.	Nneɛma ahyɛ mu ma.
Or maybe you just don’t feel like your old self.	Anaasɛ ebia wo nte nka sɛ wo ho dedaw no ara kwa.
There wasn’t much time.	Ná bere pii nni hɔ.
It’s here for a week.	Ɛwɔ ha dapɛn biako.
He had no idea what to say.	Ná onni nea ɔbɛka ho adwene biara.
What time of year was this?	Afe no mu bere bɛn na na eyi yɛ?
There is no danger.	Asiane biara nni hɔ.
Think about most people you know.	Susuw nnipa dodow no ara a wunim wɔn ho hwɛ.
The image includes several images.	Mfonini no de mfonini ahorow pii ka ho.
Your home is a work in progress.	Wo fie yɛ adwuma a ɛrekɔ so.
Check out the available resources.	Hwɛ nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ.
It had seen better days.	Ná ahu nna a eye sen saa.
It was just too dangerous.	Ná asiane wom dodo ara kwa.
Every one of them is there.	Wɔn mu biara wɔ hɔ.
Dangerous, or not.	Asiane, anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
But he obviously does.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
The problem just kept getting worse from there.	Ɔhaw no kɔɔ so yɛɛ kɛse fi hɔ ara kwa.
This includes last year	Eyi ka afe a etwaam no
Man is an animal.	Onipa yɛ aboa.
I didn’t want to hear it.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete.
I am almost here.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mewɔ ha.
Don’t let the dog out.	Mma ɔkraman no mfi adi.
The same isn’t true.	Saa ara na ɛnyɛ saa.
Everything and everyone.	Biribiara ne obiara.
But you’re out of it.	Nanso w’ani fi so.
I could have anything.	Ná metumi anya biribiara.
But he did something wrong that night.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ ade bɔne saa anadwo no.
Is it enough information.	So ɛyɛ nsɛm a ɛdɔɔso.
That was nice, if a little weird about them.	Na ɛno yɛ fɛ, sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra wɔ wɔn ho a.
No one ever leaves .	Obiara mfi hɔ mma da .
It looked like a monster.	Ná ɛte sɛ aboa kɛse bi.
It’s definitely me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ me.
They are also innocent.	Wɔn nso ho nyɛ hwee.
Take such opportunities it would.	Fa hokwan ahorow a ɛte saa a anka ɛbɛyɛ.
What do we have going on here? 	Dɛn na yɛwɔ a ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha?
You cannot and will not win.	Worentumi nni nkonim na worentumi nni nkonim nso.
The idea was his.	Ná adwene no yɛ ne de.
I think that’s still true, for me.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno da so ara yɛ nokware, wɔ me fam.
But whatever it is.	Nanso sɛnea ɛte biara.
It’s not hard, is it?	Ɛnyɛ den, ɛnte saa?
He’s even happy.	N’ani gye mpo.
Don’t startle the dog!	Mma ɔkraman no ho dwiriw no!
Just the general idea.	Adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa ara kwa.
He has a lot of things to do.	Ɔwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
So much of this stuff.	Enti saa nneɛma yi mu dodow no ara.
Under my control.	Wɔ me tumi ase.
You are tall and strong.	Wo tenten na wo ho yɛ den.
Everything out there had come in, even the movies.	Ná biribiara a ɛwɔ abɔnten no aba mu, sini ahorow no mpo.
But on the other hand, he was not so present.	Nanso ɔkwan foforo so no, na onni hɔ saa.
The same is true here.	Saa ara na ɛwɔ ha nso.
I have no problem with it.	Minni ɔhaw biara wɔ ho.
He had painted pictures.	Ná wayɛ mfonini ahorow.
It was a very long walk.	Ná ɛyɛ nantew tenten paa.
That tells us.	Ɛno kyerɛ yɛn.
That seemed a little strange.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ nwonwa kakra.
It was a pleasant evening.	Ná ɛyɛ anwummere a ɛyɛ anigye.
Nothing minimal about them.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ kakraa bi wɔ wɔn ho.
It definitely works for me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma ma me.
I know you want to do it with me.	Minim sɛ wopɛ sɛ wo ne me yɛ.
Never touch it.	Nka no da.
This is the thing.	Eyi ne ade no.
So something is going on.	Enti biribi rekɔ so.
Like a girl.	Te sɛ abeawa bi.
And think about the consequences.	Na susuw nea ɛwɔ ho no ho.
So we were hopeful in the days gone by.	Enti na yɛwɔ anidaso wɔ nna a atwam no mu.
He will be completely relieved.	Ne ho bɛtɔ no koraa.
Those things have nothing to do with anything.	Saa nneɛma no ne biribiara nni hwee yɛ.
It will be like when things were not going well.	Ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ bere a na nneɛma nkɔ yiye no.
This is your home.	Eyi ne wo fie.
Neither of them knew what to do next.	Ná wɔn mu biara nnim nea ɔbɛyɛ akyi.
It’s too important.	Ɛho hia dodo.
My paper is full.	Me krataa no ayɛ ma.
Not that one though.	Ɛnyɛ saa biako no de, nanso.
He always has that.	Ɔwɔ saa bere nyinaa.
But this was true.	Nanso na eyi yɛ nokware.
I have to apologize for that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mepa kyɛw wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
And not my mother either.	Na ɛnyɛ me maame nso.
At least it does something.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ biribi.
The resources are there.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no wɔ hɔ.
And water, too.	Na nsu nso.
He is a monster.	Ɔyɛ aboa kɛse bi.
In a more human way than before.	Wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nnipa de so sen kan no.
There was no one on the street.	Ná obiara nni abɔnten so.
In my opinion anyway.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no ɔkwan biara so.
That’s your problem, not mine.	Ɛno ne wo haw, na ɛnyɛ me de.
He had to take her.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde no kɔ.
He was a weakling.	Ná ɔyɛ mmerɛw.
I just wanted you to know that.	Na mepɛ sɛ wuhu saa asɛm no ara kwa.
Not everything will be quite so exciting.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara na ɛbɛyɛ anigye saa koraa.
It may be in vain.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ kwa.
Move and start over.	Tu kɔ baabi foforo na fi ase bio.
This can affect the final price.	Eyi betumi aka bo a etwa to no.
And not that one.	Na ɛnyɛ saa biako no.
That will take some habit.	Ɛno begye sɛ obi yɛ ne su bi.
It’s just a game.	Ɛyɛ agoru bi kɛkɛ.
A lot of time has passed.	Bere pii atwam.
I used to be pretty good at these things.	Kan no na me ho akokwaw yiye wɔ saa nneɛma yi mu.
The first book was an incredible success.	Nhoma a edi kan no dii yiye ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Make sure the information is accurate.	Hwɛ hu sɛ nsɛm no yɛ nokware.
I love that movie.	M’ani gye saa sini no ho.
Sounds easy enough!.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ!.
However, it didn’t.	Nanso, anyɛ saa.
It was very impressive.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
And how wonderful that is.	Na hwɛ sɛnea ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
He has only three animals.	Ɔwɔ mmoa abiɛsa pɛ.
He was strong, masculine and handsome.	Ná ne ho yɛ den, ɔyɛ ɔbarima na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Can you help?.	So wubetumi aboa?.
Little did I know it was much worse.	Ná minnim sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne sen saa koraa.
Everyone went back to their homes.	Obiara san kɔɔ ne fie.
Handle.	Di ho dwuma.
He knows it’s my favorite day of the year.	Onim sɛ ɛyɛ da a m’ani gye ho paa wɔ afe no mu.
Use that information.	Fa saa nsɛm no di dwuma.
The book is over.	Nhoma no aba awiei.
All the other kids loved it so much.	Ná mmofra a aka no nyinaa ani gye ho kɛse.
I shouldn’t have said that.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meka saa.
I am quite willing to talk about anything.	Mewɔ ɔpɛ koraa sɛ mɛka biribiara ho asɛm.
No one should leave unhappy.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara fi hɔ a n’ani nnye ho.
It will be great.	Ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
I agree with you on that.	Me ne wo yɛ adwene wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
It’s only a movie, and he’s only a man.	Ɛyɛ sini nkutoo, na ɔyɛ ɔbarima nkutoo.
I forgot about you too.	Me nso me werɛ fii wo.
His head was evil.	Ná ne ti yɛ bɔne.
It’s not about that at all.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ho asɛm koraa.
But it wasn’t scary.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ hu.
This group has been united.	Saa kuw yi ayɛ biako.
That is not true here.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware wɔ ha.
We will feel better soon.	Yɛn ho bɛtɔ yɛn nnansa yi ara.
That’s why he felt so good.	Ɛno nti na ne ho tɔɔ no saa no.
But it doesn’t work.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma.
If it’s the latter, you do.	Sɛ ɛyɛ nea etwa to no a, woyɛ saa.
Just give us one more.	Ma yɛn biako bio kɛkɛ.
His will is your best self being honest with you.	Ne pɛ ne wo ho a eye sen biara a wobɛka nokware akyerɛ wo.
Bad movies are not fun.	Sini bɔne nyɛ anigye.
A lot goes into this part of the project.	Pii kɔ adwuma no fã yi mu.
And it was pretty amazing.	Na na ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
They were organized in words and eloquence.	Ná wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe wɔ nsɛm a wɔka ne nsɛm a wɔka no yiye mu.
Maybe I'll do that.	Ebia mɛyɛ saa.
He was interested in it.	Ná n’ani gye ho.
He controlled himself better than anyone he knew.	Ná odi ne ho so yiye sen obiara a onim no.
But most of their studies would take place at home.	Nanso na wɔn adesua no fã kɛse no ara bɛkɔ so wɔ fie.
A a.	A a.
It seemed strange.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
As long as he was happy.	Bere tenten a na n’ani agye no.
It was an exercised power.	Na ɛyɛ tumi a wɔde adi dwuma.
You can do that in one weekend.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa wɔ dapɛn awiei biako mu.
People fell into each other, fell.	Nkurɔfo hwee wɔn ho wɔn ho mu, hwee ase.
Get out of it.	Fi no mu.
I am doing a lot of work.	Mereyɛ adwuma pii.
But that’s not really the truth.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nokware no ankasa.
But not in the good way at all.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɔkwan pa no so koraa.
It works well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
And he even looked dangerous.	Na na ɔte sɛ nea asiane wom mpo.
He was such a real man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima ankasa a ɔte saa.
I couldn’t hear.	Na mintumi nte asɛm.
If it is somehow wrong.	Sɛ ɛyɛ ɔkwan bi so no, ɛyɛ mfomso.
I had to give them something.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede biribi ma wɔn.
We had a three-day weekend ahead of us.	Ná yɛwɔ nnansa dapɛn awiei wɔ yɛn anim.
Lots of ingredients.	Nneɛma a wɔde yɛ aduan pii.
I believed this was a bad idea.	Ná migye di sɛ eyi yɛ adwene bɔne.
He hung up the phone.	Ɔde telefon no too fam.
Or a little longer.	Anaasɛ bere tenten kakra.
Now this is no longer necessary.	Mprempren eyi ho nhia bio.
Or tomorrow night.	Anaasɛ ɔkyena anadwo.
It’s not good or bad, it just is.	Ɛnyɛ papa anaa bɔne, ɛyɛ ara kwa.
I want to work with you.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo yɛ adwuma.
Aside from that, he would work on the next one.	Sɛ ɔde to nkyɛn a, na ɔbɛyɛ nea edi hɔ no ho adwuma.
Give it a few days.	Ma no nna kakraa bi.
However, that oldest one.	Nanso, saa nea akyɛ sen biara no.
So, this is not realistic.	Enti, eyi ntumi mma mu ankasa.
It was just us and it was amazing.	Na ɛyɛ yɛn nkutoo na na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It would be a good idea.	Ɛbɛyɛ adwene pa.
Someone asked if we should do anything about them.	Obi bisaa sɛ ebia ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ wɔn ho biribi anaa.
Who is he, anyway? 	Ɔyɛ hena?
This was our room.	Ná eyi ne yɛn dan.
Your going to be one.	Wo kɔ yɛ biako.
The first one made two.	Nea odi kan no yɛɛ abien.
He was a happy person and a really nice person.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔwɔ anigye na na ɔyɛ onipa pa ankasa.
I know what you mean.	Minim nea wopɛ sɛ woka.
This is his best year yet.	Eyi ne afe a eye sen biara a ɔde besi nnɛ.
To do what.	Sɛ wobɛyɛ nea.
I'm sure my mom would love it too.	Migye di sɛ me maame nso ani begye ho.
That’s one of his things.	Ɛno yɛ ne nneɛma no mu biako.
This wasn’t surprising.	Eyi anyɛ nwonwa.
The boy saw nothing.	Abarimaa no anhu hwee.
I think we can make it work, still.	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi ama ayɛ yiye, da so ara.
It hurts all over it.	Ɛyɛ yaw wɔ ne nyinaa so.
Their food is amazing.	Wɔn aduan yɛ nwonwa.
It didn’t matter if the house burned down completely.	Sɛ ofie no hyew koraa a, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
I'm perfect.	Meyɛ pɛ.
However, that is not the reason.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno nti na ɛte saa.
I want you to know something.	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu biribi.
It’s really quite interesting.	Ɛyɛ anigye koraa ankasa.
Trust me on that one.	Fa wo ho to me so wɔ saa biako no so.
There was no music.	Na nnwom biara nni hɔ.
There are many different types of products.	Nneɛma ahorow pii wɔ hɔ a wɔyɛ.
This will be great.	Eyi bɛyɛ kɛse.
However, it was a last resort.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ ade a etwa to.
He made a big deal about this last night.	Ɔyɛɛ ade kɛse bi wɔ eyi ho anadwo a etwaam no.
But it’s terrible.	Nanso ɛyɛ hu.
Need a few days.	Hia nna kakra.
And it was something else.	Na ɛyɛ biribi foforo nso.
This is close.	Eyi bɛn.
I still want to do that.	Meda so ara pɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
Take the time to do it.	Gye bere yɛ.
You don’t have to argue with your mother.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wo ne wo maame gye akyinnye.
We’re actually pretty strong.	Yɛn ho yɛ den yiye ankasa.
There is no one else.	Obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
I don't know too much what that was all about.	Minnim nea na ɛno nyinaa fa ho dodo.
My dad offered to drive us to the park.	Me papa kae sɛ ɔde yɛn bɛka kar akɔ abɔnten so.
The dog went back to the shelter.	Ɔkraman no san kɔɔ baabi a wɔde wɔn ho to so no.
They are too strong.	Wɔn ho yɛ den dodo.
You are far from alone.	Ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo na wowɔ koraa.
So much power in something so simple.	Tumi pii saa wɔ biribi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa mu.
In any case, he might already be home.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ebia na ɔwɔ fie dedaw.
Look, there were two other people in the room.	Hwɛ, na nnipa baanu foforo wɔ dan no mu.
That’s what’s going on.	Ɛno na ɛrekɔ so.
This is not possible.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
It’s not really true.	Ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa.
But it wasn’t necessary.	Nanso na ɛho nhia.
Consider the first two periods and	Susuw bere abien a edi kan no ho na .
That might be easier.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I did this for two reasons.	Nneɛma abien bi nti na meyɛɛ eyi.
It was my first book.	Ná ɛyɛ me nhoma a edi kan.
And so another exciting chapter unfolds.	Na enti ti foforo a ɛyɛ anigye da adi.
You give it to the police.	Wode ma polisifo.
I had a similar situation with the first one.	Ná mewɔ tebea a ɛte saa ara wɔ nea edi kan no ho.
But this is true only up to a point.	Nanso eyi yɛ nokware kosi baabi nkutoo.
Use one or the other.	Fa biako anaa foforo di dwuma.
And that was painful.	Na ɛno yɛɛ yaw.
Nothing ever worked.	Biribiara anyɛ adwuma da.
I thought you were alone.	Misusuwii sɛ wo nkutoo na wowɔ hɔ.
This is the way.	Eyi ne ɔkwan no.
Go back to bed.	San kɔ mpa so.
The bottom line is the same as the bottom line.	Nsɛm a ɛwɔ ase hɔ no yɛ asɛm koro no ara a ɛwɔ ase no.
There must be something in front.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi wɔ anim.
You know what you have.	Wunim nea wowɔ.
Children will be children.	Mmofra bɛyɛ mmofra.
The latter continues to operate today.	Nea etwa to no kɔ so yɛ adwuma nnɛ.
He put it in his words.	Ɔde hyɛɛ ne nsɛm mu.
Often.	Mpɛn pii.
Very nice in quality.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye wɔ su mu.
His books were always fresh.	Ná ne nhoma ahorow no yɛ nea ɛyɛ foforo bere nyinaa.
We need to do something about it now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi mprempren.
I know you can do this.	Minim sɛ wubetumi ayɛ eyi.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I don’t even know how you would do that.	Minnim sɛnea anka wobɛyɛ saa mpo.
Now.	Seesei.
You can’t, you just can’t.	Worentumi, worentumi nyɛ saa ara.
I had that.	Ná mewɔ saa.
One is as strong as the other.	Biako yɛ den te sɛ biako no.
No problem.	Ɔhaw nni hɔ.
I really need to be more initiative about the whole thing.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ade a edi kan kɛse ankasa wɔ ade no nyinaa ho.
I thought the same thing.	Misusuwii saa ara.
I have been out of town for the past week.	Mewɔ kurow no akyi dapɛn a atwam ni.
The results had obviously been positive.	Ɛda adi sɛ na nneɛma pa biara afi mu aba.
He brought me here.	Ɔde me baa ha.
Nothing else that night.	Biribiara nni hɔ bio saa anadwo no.
Give or take a few years.	Ma anaa gye mfe kakraa bi.
Everyone had an idea.	Ná obiara wɔ adwene bi.
You need to do these two things before any other settings.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa nneɛma abien yi ansa na woayɛ nhyehyɛe foforo biara.
He was a strong man.	Ná ne ho yɛ den.
But it’s pretty amazing.	Nanso ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
For a moment, he surprised her.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​nwonwa bere tiaa bi.
You really have to think things through.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw nneɛma ho ankasa.
It is true in a sense.	Ɛyɛ nokware wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
He never wants anything else.	Ɔmpɛ biribi foforo biara da.
And I don’t want to do that either.	Na me nso mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
I am the only one he sleeps with.	Me nkutoo na ɔne no da.
Look, it doesn’t matter.	Hwɛ, ɛnyɛ hwee.
Don’t take them.	Mfa wɔn.
You give it to him for acting right there.	Wode ma no sɛ wayɛ agoru wɔ hɔ ara.
I used to like your mother.	Kan no na m’ani gye wo maame ho.
That’s your leg.	Ɛno ne wo nan.
He nodded his head.	Ɔde ne ti too fam.
He loves to play.	Ɔpɛ agoru.
That was something he could definitely do.	Ná ɛno yɛ biribi a akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ obetumi ayɛ.
I don’t know what the weekend will bring.	Minnim nea dapɛn awiei no de bɛba.
It works for them.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ma wɔn.
You know what they have to do.	Wunim nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
In the end, I matter.	Awiei koraa no, me ho hia me.
He has an easy job.	Ɔwɔ adwuma a ɛnyɛ den.
I know a lot about you.	Minim wo ho nsɛm pii.
In the last study.	Wɔ adesua a etwa to no mu.
We all want it.	Yɛn nyinaa pɛ.
I should mention a bit about my wife here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka me yere ho asɛm kakra wɔ ha.
Year after year after year.	Afe biara afe biara.
Can anyone out there help me with this please.	So obi a ɔwɔ hɔ betumi aboa me wɔ eyi mu mesrɛ wo.
It’s faster now.	Ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm mprempren.
It’s not something to get excited about.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye ho.
I didn't know you did that.	Ná minnim sɛ woyɛ saa.
He knew himself, he understood himself.	Ná onim ne ho, na ɔte ne ho ase.
You go out with me for a while.	Wo ne me fi adi kakra.
She was beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I apologize for the quality of the pictures.	Mepa wo kyɛw sɛ mfonini ahorow no yɛ papa.
It was easy.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
It’s not really a book.	Ɛnyɛ nhoma ankasa.
We are the work of men.	Yɛyɛ nnipa adwuma.
He eats what is real.	Odi nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa no.
This is no accident.	Eyi nyɛ akwanhyia.
They had to be with them.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka wɔn ho.
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho.
It wasn’t like that.	Ná ɛnte saa.
I know it’s them.	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ wɔn.
The object is in working condition.	Ade no wɔ tebea a ɛyɛ adwuma mu.
Just go back home.	San kɔ fie kɛkɛ.
Everyone does that.	Obiara yɛ saa.
The school was packed yesterday.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ sukuu no mu ma nnɛra.
Quite surprisingly.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa no.
It was almost bizarre.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Know where your animals are.	Hu baabi a mo mmoa wɔ.
Many people don’t get that.	Nnipa pii nnya saa.
The end of the road.	Ɔkwan no awiei.
Whatever it is, that doesn’t matter.	Nea ɛte biara no, ɛno ho nhia.
We are very happy.	Yɛn ani agye kɛse.
That’s a lot of money.	Ɛno yɛ sika pii.
The face was not the same face.	Ná anim no nyɛ anim koro no ara.
Like, just weird stuff.	Te sɛ, nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
This still makes it sound too important though.	Eyi da so ara ma ɛte sɛ nea ɛho hia dodo nanso.
He is more accomplished than you seem to think.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ adwuma yiye sen sɛnea ɛte sɛ nea wususuw.
And that’s hard.	Na ɛno yɛ den.
This is definitely something that needs to be done.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He thinks the child is beautiful.	Osusuw sɛ abofra no ho yɛ fɛ.
I love the new look.	M’ani gye sɛnea ɛte foforo no ho.
You know maybe.	Wunim sɛ ebia.
He’s my money?	Ɔno me sika?
But he was here.	Nanso na ɔwɔ ha.
It’s one of those things.	Ɛyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biako.
You have to tell him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka kyerɛ no.
I still have them.	Meda so ara wɔ wɔn.
I think we are both similar types.	Misusuw sɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛ ahorow a ɛte saa ara.
They tell me about everything.	Wɔka biribiara ho asɛm kyerɛ me.
This feature is widely used.	Wɔde saa ade yi di dwuma kɛse.
He did what he told him to do.	Ɔyɛɛ nea ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɔnyɛ.
The story is nothing new.	Asɛm no nyɛ ade foforo.
They all bother him.	Wɔn nyinaa haw no.
Remind me to do this tomorrow.	Kae me sɛ menyɛ eyi ɔkyena.
Not unless there’s something in it for him.	Ɛnyɛ gye sɛ biribi wɔ mu ma no.
Work is in progress in this direction.	Adwuma rekɔ so wɔ saa kwan yi so.
There is no reason to be happy.	Biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye.
But it didn’t.	Nanso amma.
So he's involved.	Enti ne ho ahyɛ mu ma.
They were the cutest animals.	Ná wɔyɛ mmoa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ sen biara.
That’s the issue here.	Ɛno ne asɛm a ɛwɔ ha.
No man was ever like that.	Ɔbarima biara nni hɔ a na ɔte sɛ saa da.
How much is too much or too little.	Dodow ahe na ɛdɔɔso dodo anaa kakraa bi dodo.
Is that your car there?	So ɛno ne wo kar wɔ hɔ?
However, there was one thing he had to do first.	Nanso, na ade biako wɔ hɔ a na ɛsɛ sɛ odi kan yɛ.
Whatever I can do for you.	Nea metumi biara ma wo.
He didn't know what the big deal was.	Ná onnim nea ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse no.
So it’s whether you have that kind of money .	Enti ɛyɛ sɛ ebia wowɔ sika a ɛte saa anaa .
And besides, it doesn’t matter.	Na ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɛho nhia.
So that’s why, .	Enti ɛno nti na, .
He is a good man.	Ɔyɛ onipa pa.
Everything is more complicated.	Biribiara mu yɛ den sen saa.
If you have one, this is the time to use it.	Sɛ wowɔ bi a, eyi ne bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wode di dwuma.
He is the last hope of his people.	Ɔno ne ne nkurɔfo anidaso a etwa to.
All I wanted to say was.	Nea na mepɛ sɛ meka ara ne sɛ.
It is beautiful and wonderful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Just look inside yourself.	Hwɛ wo mu ara kwa.
There was no reason for it.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
And even recently.	Na nnansa yi mpo.
It’s very good.	Ɛyɛ papa paa.
The old, not the new.	Dedaw no, ɛnyɛ foforo no.
I just want to understand you.	Nea mepɛ ara ne sɛ mete wo ase.
The party goes, whatever.	Apontow no kɔ, nea ɛte biara.
It’s a job offer.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a wɔde ma.
You have to do this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He added the finishing touches to a plan.	Ɔde nneɛma a etwa to no kaa nhyehyɛe bi ho.
There was no one else.	Ná obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
That is still true.	Ɛno da so ara yɛ nokware.
Or that it’s true for us, but not true for him.	Anaasɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware ma yɛn, nanso ɛnyɛ nokware ma no.
I never needed it.	Na ɛho nhia me da.
This must have been a mistake.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na eyi yɛ mfomso.
We can’t tell.	Yɛrentumi nhu.
Look, here it is!	Hwɛ, wɔ ha!
Not that it doesn’t.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
Exit, go back outside.	Fi adi, san kɔ abɔnten.
And if people need that, fine.	Na sɛ nkurɔfo hia saa a, eye.
It all worked out perfectly.	Ne nyinaa dii yiye koraa.
And in that first year.	Na wɔ saa afe a edi kan no mu.
You here a lot.	Wo ha pii.
Another bad idea.	Adwene bɔne foforo.
Like he would.	Te sɛ nea ɔbɛyɛ saa.
And it was a great one.	Na ɛyɛ kɛse.
I can’t handle it.	Mintumi nni ho dwuma.
But he trusted me.	Nanso ɔde ne ho too me so.
However, I have to be very careful.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye paa.
I worry about those kids.	Saa mmofra no ho asɛm haw me.
It’s too late in the game.	Ɛyɛ nea aka akyi dodo wɔ agoru no mu.
That was not what I meant.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea na mepɛ sɛ meka.
But in my day it was something else.	Nanso me bere so no na ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
Days are long.	Nna yɛ tenten.
Your life is not in danger.	Wo nkwa nni asiane mu.
If you can reach it.	Sɛ wubetumi adu ho a.
We hope you can do that.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi ayɛ saa.
And maybe it doesn’t matter.	Na ebia ɛnyɛ hwee.
It’s good to do a little bit of both.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ abien no nyinaa kakra.
She surrendered to him now.	Ɔde ne ho maa no mprempren.
A boy's turn, indeed.	Abarimaa bi dan, ampa.
How do you even know this?.	Wobɛyɛ dɛn ahu eyi mpo?.
He had no job.	Ná onni adwuma biara.
I've worked on it.	Mayɛ ho adwuma.
It must be hard for him to say anything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den ma no sɛ ɔbɛka biribiara.
The dress was gorgeous.	Ná atade no yɛ fɛ yiye.
Which was nothing.	Nea na ɛnyɛ hwee.
Consider this is the first reason why the system sucks.	Susuw eyi ne ade a edi kan nti a nhyehyɛe no su.
They entrust life to each other.	Wɔde nkwa hyɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho nsa.
I don’t think he could look at us the same way again.	Minsusuw sɛ na obetumi ahwɛ yɛn saa ara bio.
Take a closer look at this!	Hwɛ eyi yiye!
The good news.	Nsɛm pa no.
Both movies had happy endings.	Sini abien no nyinaa baa awiei a ɛyɛ anigye.
He wasn’t as excited as he used to be.	Ná n’ani nnye ho kɛse te sɛ kan no.
It doesn't look like it's been touched in years.	Ɛnte sɛ nea wɔde wɔn nsa aka no mfe pii mu.
It is a time when	Ɛyɛ bere a .
You have important work to do.	Wowɔ adwuma a ɛho hia a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I don’t know what, but it’s bad.	Minnim nea, nanso ɛyɛ bɔne.
He plays with her like that for a while.	Ɔne no di agoru saa bere tiaa bi.
Everyone can see it.	Obiara tumi hu.
Even if it is for a short time.	Sɛ ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi mpo a.
Anyway, you can get one without the other.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, wubetumi anya biako a biako no nka ho.
He was at home with them.	Ná ɔne wɔn wɔ fie.
That’s how it will be.	Saa na ɛbɛyɛ.
I'm the first one on the list now.	Me ne obi a odi kan wɔ din no mu mprempren.
I don’t think anyone even knew it existed.	Minsusuw sɛ na obiara nim mpo sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
So there’s that.	Enti ɛno wɔ hɔ.
This means, that no temporary conditions are needed.	Eyi kyerɛ, sɛ bere tiaa mu tebea biara ho nhia.
No one can do this for you.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ eyi mma wo.
That will be the case.	Ɛno bɛyɛ saa.
It is a dangerous job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a asiane wom.
And you're the one.	Na wo ni.
More on that here.	Ɛno ho nsɛm pii wɔ ha.
This bed is for people who work here.	Saa mpa yi yɛ ma nnipa a wɔyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
The party was lively.	Ná apontow no mu yɛ hyew.
That shouldn’t be that surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa saa.
It is better to be quick.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ ntɛm.
I just couldn’t do that.	Na mintumi nyɛ saa ara.
He was gone for days.	Ná onni hɔ nna pii.
He may be the first person since.	Ebia ɔno ne onipa a odi kan fi saa bere no.
' '.	' '.
He is an authority on the subject.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔwɔ tumi wɔ asɛm no ho.
It works well, in most any situation.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye, wɔ tebea biara mu dodow no ara mu.
Get out when you can.	Fi adi bere a wubetumi no.
I think a lot of people will follow.	Misusuw sɛ nnipa pii bedi akyi.
I thought about everything.	Misusuw biribiara ho.
He had painted it himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa ayɛ ho mfonini.
If anyone can use it, great.	Sɛ obi betumi de adi dwuma a, kɛse.
Or so we were told.	Anaasɛ saa na wɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn.
That’s all he would do.	Ɛno ara ne nea anka ɔbɛyɛ.
Or anyway, really.	Anaasɛ ɔkwan biara so, ampa.
He treated her as an equal.	Ɔne no dii sɛ obi a ɔne no yɛ pɛ.
But that man is seriously mistaken.	Nanso saa ɔbarima no adi mfomso kɛse.
But it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛnte saa.
There are many people in this city.	Nnipa pii wɔ kurow yi mu.
I don’t know that many people entertain a similar idea.	Minnim sɛ nnipa pii gye adwene a ɛte saa ara ani.
What it was.	Nea na ɛyɛ.
The road seemed empty.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔkwan no so nni hwee.
A strange incident happened on the bus ride home.	Asɛm bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa sii wɔ bɔs a yɛde kɔ fie no mu.
That’s not optimal or bad.	Ɛno nyɛ nea eye sen biara anaasɛ ɛnyɛ papa.
It doesn’t happen anymore.	Ɛnyɛ bio.
Easy to say, but hard to do.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛka, nanso ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ.
Maybe he’ll tell me.	Ebia ɔbɛka akyerɛ me.
He was no longer there.	Ná onni hɔ bio.
I didn’t want to be out there.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mewɔ abɔnten hɔ.
We could even do it over the phone.	Ná yebetumi mpo ayɛ no wɔ telefon so.
The years have passed quickly.	Mfe no atwam ntɛmntɛm.
However, it doesn’t matter.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ asɛm biara.
Winter is important.	Awɔw bere ho hia.
It’s in our bedroom at night.	Ɛwɔ yɛn mpa mu anadwo.
Maybe he is.	Ebia ɔte saa.
It’s not a joke.	Ɛnyɛ agoru.
Not like you.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ wo.
Everything seems to be working fine.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara reyɛ adwuma yiye.
For me, at least.	Wɔ me fam no, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
He may never recover.	Ebia ne ho bɛtɔ no da.
This was obviously not his room.	Ɛda adi sɛ na eyi nyɛ ne dan.
As can be seen, everyone had a great time.	Sɛnea yebetumi ahu no, obiara nyaa anigye kɛse.
Dinner will be served.	Wɔde anwummere aduan bɛma.
He was a very young man.	Na ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
He slammed his hand on the table.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ pon no so.
They work every day.	Wɔyɛ adwuma da biara da.
The table is too short.	Pon no yɛ tiaa dodo.
That kid is telling the truth.	Saa abofra no ka nokware.
The time zone is set.	Wɔde bere no fã a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma no asi hɔ.
Follow, don’t lead.	Di akyi, nni anim.
It’s not just the school.	Ɛnyɛ sukuu no nkutoo.
And after that.	Na ɛno akyi no.
I was outside in the cold.	Ná mewɔ abɔnten a awɔw wom.
We were very strong.	Ná yɛyɛ den yiye.
I can’t deal with this issue.	Me ntumi nni asɛm yi ho dwuma.
It was really pretty.	Na ɛyɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
So, money does play a role.	Enti, sika di dwuma bi ampa.
It was the street.	Ná ɛyɛ abɔnten so.
But that wasn’t me.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ me na ɛte saa.
He is a beautiful character.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
That was a great thing.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade kɛse.
I have an opinion on it.	Mewɔ adwene bi wɔ ho.
Truth is on the street.	Nokware wɔ abɔnten so.
All those pictures.	Saa mfonini ahorow no nyinaa.
We all hope for the best for him.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ anidaso sɛ nea eye sen biara bɛba no.
I can’t believe it works so well, but it does.	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma yiye saa, nanso ɛyɛ adwuma.
So, you’re the one.	Enti, wo ne no.
A little really is a lot.	Kakraa ankasa yɛ pii.
I have always been a problem child.	Meyɛ abofra a ɔwɔ ɔhaw bere nyinaa.
But this is often a lie.	Nanso eyi taa yɛ atoro.
They are real.	Wɔyɛ ankasa.
For me, that was huge.	Wɔ me fam no, na ɛno yɛ kɛse.
Obviously, his name already exists.	Ɛda adi sɛ ne din wɔ hɔ dedaw.
The same thing was true.	Saa ara na na ɛte.
I was absolutely shocked at this man’s story.	Me ho dwiriw me koraa wɔ ɔbarima yi asɛm no ho.
I just thought of something.	Misusuw biribi ho kɛkɛ.
What had happened shocked him.	Nea asi no maa ne ho dwiriw no.
Go back to school.	San kɔ sukuu.
I have to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
This is terrible.	Eyi yɛ hu.
I brought him to me that way.	Me de no baa me nkyɛn saa kwan no so.
He had to be a dog.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ɔkraman.
Even more money.	Sika pii mpo.
I wasn’t good enough.	Ná menyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
They pointed a gun at him.	Wɔde tuo kyerɛɛ no.
She is a beautiful girl.	Ɔyɛ abeawa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Because of that number.	Saa dodow no nti.
I don’t think he should.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
He has a long mouth.	Ɔwɔ ano tenten.
Tell us what you know.	Ka nea wunim kyerɛ yɛn.
Everyone said that.	Obiara kaa saa.
The group wants all manufacturers to follow the convention.	Kuw no pɛ sɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ nneɛma no nyinaa di nhyiam no akyi.
Only a few days left.	Aka nna kakraa bi pɛ.
And he had some, too.	Na ɔwɔ bi nso.
That works well too.	Ɛno nso yɛ adwuma yiye.
It was very dangerous.	Na asiane kɛse wom.
It’s the other people.	Ɛyɛ nnipa a aka no.
The water had not been continuous for many years.	Ná nsu no nkɔ so mfe pii.
He seemed like such a happy person.	Ná ɛte sɛ obi a ɔwɔ anigye saa.
That was a fun grab.	Ná ɛno yɛ anigye a wɔde gye nkurɔfo adwene.
Be sure to make a plan.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wobɛyɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
He handed me the gun.	Ɔde tuo no maa me.
Thank you very much.	Meda wo ase pii.
It’s not a leg.	Ɛnyɛ nan.
Real people surprise us and do different things on different days.	Nnipa ankasa ma yɛn ho dwiriw yɛn na wɔyɛ nneɛma ahorow wɔ nna ahorow mu.
I think you’ll be really happy.	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ankasa.
The dog scurried under the table.	Ɔkraman no de mmirika kɔɔ pon no ase.
This will take some time.	Eyi begye bere kakra.
They were	Na wɔyɛ .
It didn’t sound good.	Ná ɛnte sɛ nea eye.
Likewise.	Saa ara na.
I don't know if that's why.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno nti na ɛte saa anaa.
I really enjoyed it today.	M’ani gyee ho paa nnɛ.
Or even a letter to him.	Anaasɛ krataa bi mpo ma no.
You can’t take it.	Worentumi mfa no.
There were two in the same person.	Ná abien wɔ onipa koro mu.
I can’t sleep.	Mintumi da.
There seemed to be nothing.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara nni hɔ.
It works surprisingly well.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
They were sentenced to years in prison.	Wɔde mfe pii too afiase.
But it’s so hot!	Nanso ɛyɛ hyew yiye!
We all need to think about these problems.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa susuw ɔhaw ahorow yi ho.
Anyway, that didn't seem to work.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛno anyɛ adwuma.
But tell me.	Nanso ka kyerɛ me.
But for me, it’s not fun.	Nanso me fam no, ɛnyɛ anigye.
This seems like a really good one for you.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ nea eye ankasa ma wo.
It’s just going on, on and on.	Ɛrekɔ so ara kwa, ɛrekɔ so na ɛrekɔ so.
There is a serious flaw in my thinking.	Mfomso kɛse bi wɔ m’adwene mu.
I felt that way many times.	Metee nka sɛ ɛte saa mpɛn pii.
Do’s and don’ts.	Nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ne nea ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I can’t see the man.	Mintumi nhu ɔbarima no.
We can do this.	Yebetumi ayɛ eyi.
Definitely harder than mine.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ den sen me de no.
Go to work every morning.	Anɔpa biara kɔ adwuma.
I am full of emptiness.	Meyɛ ma a hwee nni mu.
He did a lot of plays.	Ɔyɛɛ agoru ahorow pii.
I must have had my hands in my hair.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na me nsa ahyɛ me ti nhwi mu.
I want it to be amazing.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I had planned to join them there.	Ná mayɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mɛka wɔn ho wɔ hɔ.
But it still does.	Nanso ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
He wants to be happy with everything he does.	Ɔpɛ sɛ n’ani gye biribiara a ɔyɛ ho.
It doesn’t hurt that he likes her, either.	Ɛnyɛ yaw sɛ n’ani gye ne ho, nso.
However, this is just a concept.	Nanso, eyi yɛ adwene bi kɛkɛ.
That should say it all.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ka ne nyinaa.
Very good food, and very interesting.	Aduan a eye paa, na ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
They obviously loved the music.	Ɛda adi sɛ na wɔn ani gye nnwom no ho.
I just couldn’t do the job.	Na mintumi nyɛ adwuma no ara kwa.
Children will be children.	Mmofra bɛyɛ mmofra.
It was easy, really.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw, ampa.
But it wasn’t that easy.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
I can’t say it anymore.	Mintumi nka bio.
Just another perspective here.	Adwene foforo bi kɛkɛ wɔ ha.
I am doing quite well.	Mereyɛ yiye koraa.
There was one first.	Ná biako wɔ hɔ a edi kan.
He is with me.	Ɔka me ho.
It’s a big problem right now.	Ɛyɛ ɔhaw kɛse mprempren.
I like what you have to say.	M’ani gye nea wowɔ ka ho.
I was over the moon.	Ná mewɔ ɔsram no so.
It’s really hopeless.	Ɛyɛ nea anidaso biara nnim ankasa.
I know he was with her.	Minim sɛ na ɔka ne ho.
He was a happy man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔwɔ anigye.
All those years ago.	Saa mfe no nyinaa a atwam ni.
That is the best we can do in this situation.	Ɛno ne nea eye sen biara a yɛbɛyɛ wɔ tebea yi mu.
Go with the one who works for you.	Wo ne nea ɔyɛ adwuma ma wo no kɔ.
How do you know?	Wobɛyɛ dɛn ahu?
It is the case that it is not.	Ɛte saa a ɛnyɛ saa.
Not when he wasn’t working.	Ɛnyɛ bere a na ɔnyɛ adwuma no.
It still hurts me.	Ɛda so ara yɛ me yaw.
We both will do that.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa bɛyɛ saa.
But there is still hope.	Nanso anidaso da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Otherwise, just as good.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛyɛ papa saa ara.
That’s the plan for you.	Ɛno ne nhyehyɛe ma wo.
But that doesn’t seem to be possible.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
That should be the end of the story.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm no awiei.
It was a slow motion.	Ná ɛte saa.
The house and room were beautiful and very reasonably priced.	Ná ofie no ne dan no yɛ fɛ na na ne bo yɛ den yiye.
He's always doing too much.	Ɔreyɛ pii dodo bere nyinaa.
But this girl.	Nanso abeawa yi.
He has joy and power.	Ɔwɔ anigye ne tumi.
What was there really? 	Dɛn na na ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa?
Check your emergency supplies.	Hwɛ nneɛma a wode bedi dwuma ntɛm ara no mu.
My mother tried to help me as much as she could.	Me maame bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛboa me sɛnea obetumi biara.
It's pretty good still though.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye da so ara de, nanso.
From what I understand, it’s a good thing.	Sɛnea mete ase no, ɛyɛ ade pa.
I do this work here.	Meyɛ saa adwuma yi wɔ ha.
Make it work.	Ma ɛnyɛ adwuma.
No one believes him.	Obiara nnye no nni.
Better than nothing.	Ɛyɛ papa sen sɛ biribiara nni hɔ.
The classes have actually started now.	Adesua ahorow no afi ase mprempren ankasa.
Therefore,	Enti,
More on that in a bit.	Ɛno ho nsɛm pii wɔ kakra mu.
I don’t care what people think of me.	Nea nkurɔfo susuw wɔ me ho no mfa me ho.
They drove into several cars.	Wɔde kar kɔɔ kar pii mu.
You can travel to the moon.	Wubetumi atu kwan akɔ ɔsram so.
We are all here now.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ ha mprempren.
All the details were the same.	Ná nsɛm no nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
His head fell to the ground.	Ne ti hwee fam.
It’s true, the hours are hard.	Ɛyɛ nokware, nnɔnhwerew no yɛ den.
It’s an important issue.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛho hia.
They are more expensive than ever.	Wɔn bo yɛ den sen bere biara.
He ran down the road.	Ɔde mmirika faa kwan no so.
But it will be possible.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
He became stronger.	Ɔyɛɛ den.
You can't 't.	Worentumi 'ntumi.
Good old winter cold.	Awɔw bere mu awɔw dedaw pa.
And it wasn’t good.	Na ɛnyɛ papa.
Include positive comments.	Fa nsɛm pa ka ho.
Everyone does that.	Obiara yɛ saa.
He seemed too reluctant to cooperate.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea na onni ɔpɛ dodo sɛ ɔbɛyɛ biako.
But the system is flawed.	Nanso nhyehyɛe no yɛ mfomso.
That was what had saved them so far.	Ɛno ne nea na agye wɔn nkwa de besi saa bere yi.
Things are getting better.	Nneɛma reyɛ yiye.
They use it for their child.	Wɔde di dwuma ma wɔn ba no.
The bed next to her was empty.	Ná mpa a ɛwɔ ne nkyɛn no so nni hwee.
This didn’t happen.	Eyi anyɛ saa.
What kind of work are you doing here?	Adwuma bɛn na woreyɛ wɔ ha?
He is a bad dog.	Ɔyɛ ɔkraman bɔne.
He loved that kind of music.	Ná n’ani gye nnwom a ɛte saa ho.
These are the things people don’t see.	Eyi ne nneɛma a nkurɔfo nhu.
You have that power.	Wowɔ saa tumi no.
It’s an important job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛho hia.
I was bitten by an animal.	Aboa bi kaa me.
The dress, she told herself.	Atade no, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ.
Most are human nature.	Dodow no ara yɛ nnipa su.
The children must have watched their father do this.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mmofra no hwɛɛ sɛnea wɔn papa yɛ eyi.
I squinted at him.	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ no.
It’s not the best.	Ɛnyɛ nea eye sen biara.
However, most of that traffic will be during rush hour.	Nanso, saa kar no mu dodow no ara bɛyɛ bere a nnipa pii kɔ hɔ no.
Look at the object carefully.	Hwɛ ade no yiye.
They were terrible.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ hu.
My father sleeps all the time.	Me papa da bere nyinaa.
He was a child.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra.
I am so sorry for how difficult it has been.	Mepa wo kyɛw paa sɛnea ayɛ den no.
Everything seemed to have gone well.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara akɔ yiye.
Just get on with the story.	Kɔ asɛm no so kɛkɛ.
The characters in these books are very human.	Nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm wɔ nhoma ahorow yi mu no yɛ nnipa paa.
He can be so amazing, so out there.	Obetumi ayɛ nwonwa saa, enti abɔnten hɔ.
If you are very bad, things don’t work out.	Sɛ woyɛ bɔne paa a, nneɛma nkɔ yiye.
I keep crying.	Mekɔ so su.
But it didn’t matter why.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ nea enti a ɛte saa no ho asɛm.
Or, at least, it was.	Anaasɛ, anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte saa.
Many people are very interested in it.	Nnipa pii ani gye ho kɛse.
Not this room.	Ɛnyɛ saa dan yi.
All the latest information is available immediately.	Nsɛm a aba foforo nyinaa wɔ hɔ ntɛm ara.
There was a group of people.	Ná nnipa kuw bi wɔ hɔ.
More people now use bicycles than cars.	Mprempren nnipa pii de sakre di dwuma sen sɛ wɔde kar bedi dwuma.
All there is is an idea.	Nea ɛwɔ hɔ ara ne adwene bi.
Of them he was the most popular.	Wɔn mu no, na ɔno na nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho sen biara.
Surely he knew better.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na onim yiye sen saa.
You can’t do these things.	Worentumi nyɛ saa nneɛma yi.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia.
That didn’t really happen to us.	Ɛno amma yɛn ankasa.
But the risk is not the same for everyone.	Nanso asiane no nyɛ ade koro mma obiara.
But in any case,.	Nanso sɛnea ɛte biara no,.
You can do the same thing.	Wo nso wubetumi ayɛ saa ara.
Use the right method.	Fa ɔkwan pa di dwuma.
And many more, too.	Na pii nso.
There is no one.	Obiara nni hɔ.
For the full story, see today's post.	Sɛ wopɛ asɛm no nyinaa a, hwɛ nnɛ krataa no.
The man had a really powerful presence.	Ná ɔbarima no wɔ obi a ɔwɔ tumi ankasa a ɔwɔ hɔ.
Like a lot of mental measurements.	Te sɛ adwene susuw pii a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma no.
I don’t know anything about him.	Minnim ne ho hwee.
But there is absolutely no help for these people.	Nanso mmoa biara nni hɔ koraa mma saa nkurɔfo yi.
I made one.	Meyɛɛ biako.
That’s really what this is about.	Ɛno ne nea eyi fa ho ankasa.
You have no idea how great that was for me.	Wunim sɛnea na ɛno yɛ kɛse ma me no ho adwene biara.
This idea was not good for me.	Ná saa adwene yi nyɛ papa wɔ me fam.
No one knows what, or how much.	Obiara nnim nea, anaa dodow ahe.
And besides, you look amazing.	Na ɛno da nkyɛn a, wo ho yɛ nwonwa.
The accident happened during rush hour.	Akwanhyia no sii wɔ bere a nnipa pii kɔ hɔ no.
He's doing good.	Ɔreyɛ papa.
He slipped out of the room.	Ɔde ne ho fii adi.
They were the worst.	Wɔn na na wɔyɛ bɔne sen biara.
There were people in the street.	Ná nnipa wɔ abɔnten so.
It’s in your eyes.	Ɛwɔ w’ani so.
This never goes away.	Eyi nkɔ da.
It’s not true.	Ɛnyɛ nokware.
Only for a short time.	Bere tiaa bi pɛ.
We were very strong.	Ná yɛyɛ den yiye.
Take your time though.	Gye wo bere nanso.
It had been real.	Ná ayɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
That’s what they say themselves.	Saa na wɔn ankasa ka.
He wants to handle things himself from here.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa di nneɛma ho dwuma fi ha.
It has to be good.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ papa.
It’s not a part of it.	Ɛnyɛ ne fã bi.
You have to think positively.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw nneɛma pa ho.
We couldn’t have done this without you.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ wo a, anka yɛrentumi nyɛ eyi.
We need to end him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde no ba awiei.
Perhaps this shouldn’t surprise us.	Ebia ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ yɛn nwonwa.
Somehow it wasn’t working as he thought.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na ɛnyɛ adwuma sɛnea na osusuw no.
When you see him, you hardly know him.	Sɛ wuhu no a, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wunnim no.
This is not just about us.	Eyi nyɛ yɛn nkutoo ho asɛm.
I think that’s a big part of the problem.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ ɔhaw no fã kɛse.
Imagine the consensus in such a situation.	Fa no sɛ adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ wɔ tebea a ɛte saa mu.
Make sure you have all the ingredients.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wowɔ nneɛma a wode bɛyɛ aduan no nyinaa.
That is not our job.	Saa na ɛnyɛ yɛn adwuma.
Before this, someone had to speak.	Ansa na eyi bɛba no, na ɛsɛ sɛ obi kasa.
And it was rare indeed.	Na na ɛho yɛ na ampa.
Everyone will want to work with you.	Obiara bɛpɛ sɛ ɔne wo yɛ adwuma.
This will be a great thing.	Eyi bɛyɛ ade kɛse bi.
It was a huge mistake.	Ná ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
Such things are great.	Nneɛma a ɛte saa no yɛ kɛse.
Did something go wrong? 	So biribi ankɔ yiye?
However, it is not at all.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
You are totally in the problem.	Wowɔ ɔhaw no mu koraa.
I had never done that before.	Ná menyɛ saa da.
That’s about the size.	Ɛno bɛyɛ sɛ ne kɛse te.
Everyone has tried.	Obiara abɔ mmɔden.
Maybe that’s true.	Ebia ɛno yɛ nokware.
Everything felt perfect.	Biribiara yɛɛ te sɛ nea edi mũ.
He is very popular.	Ɔyɛ obi a nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho kɛse.
The snake was there.	Ná ɔwɔ no wɔ hɔ.
He knew this fact.	Ná onim saa asɛm yi.
Or at least it seems that way on the surface.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa wɔ ani so.
Any sane person would agree.	Obiara a n’adwene mu da hɔ no ne no bɛyɛ adwene.
It’s really beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa.
That’s how it works so well.	Saa na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye saa.
He is good at what he does.	Ɔyɛ papa wɔ nea ɔyɛ mu.
Money does not equal happiness.	Sika ne anigye nyɛ pɛ.
The conference room was packed.	Ná nhyiam dan no mu ayɛ ma.
He had to tell her about that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka saa asɛm no ho asɛm kyerɛ no.
This was something else.	Ná eyi yɛ ade foforo.
The first one has worked well.	Nea edi kan no ayɛ adwuma yiye.
This is true again this year.	Eyi yɛ nokware bio afe yi.
He gave me a smile.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ me.
In this case it is not.	Wɔ eyi mu no ɛnyɛ saa.
No further study is necessary.	Adesua foforo biara ho nhia.
I want to renew myself.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ me foforo.
Everyone had something to say.	Ná obiara wɔ asɛm bi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka.
You were beautiful.	Ná wo ho yɛ fɛ.
Most of the time, it’s not really me when you’re there.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ me ankasa bere a wowɔ hɔ no.
He had something to say to those people.	Ná ɔwɔ asɛm bi ka kyerɛ saa nkurɔfo no.
But they are human beings.	Nanso wɔyɛ nnipa.
Consider the scene.	Susuw nea esii no ho hwɛ.
Eventually, they lose interest.	Awiei koraa no, wɔn ani nnye ho bio.
Good on him.	Eye wɔ ne so.
It is, while quite true in my opinion, besides the point.	Ɛyɛ, bere a ɛyɛ nokware koraa wɔ m’adwene mu no, sɛ asɛm no da nkyɛn a.
Do it if you want to, or not.	Yɛ no sɛ wopɛ a, anaasɛ wompɛ.
Those two schools still exist today.	Saa sukuu abien no da so ara wɔ hɔ de besi nnɛ.
There are only two of us now.	Yɛn baanu pɛ na yɛwɔ hɔ mprempren.
I could play anything.	Ná metumi abɔ biribiara.
You could see it.	Ná wubetumi ahu.
This is his plan.	Eyi ne ne nhyehyɛe.
This road is very crowded.	Ɔkwan yi so ayɛ ma kɛse.
But you are here, with me, in my thoughts.	Nanso wowɔ ha, ka me ho, wɔ m’adwene mu.
And he knew they were.	Na na onim sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
It was amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa.
And it was indeed.	Na na ɛte saa ampa.
I don’t have the power.	Minni tumi no.
I knew him from before.	Ná minim no fi kan.
The shoes were very expensive.	Ná mpaboa no bo yɛ den yiye.
It was too big for him.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse dodo ma no.
I’m happy for them, really.	M’ani agye ma wɔn, ampa.
He is not a group.	Ɔnyɛ kuw.
There must be a mistake.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mfomso bi wɔ hɔ.
I offer the same now.	Mede saa ade koro no ara ma mprempren.
Not a very good book.	Ɛnyɛ nhoma a eye koraa.
Even this is my opinion.	Eyi mpo yɛ m’adwene.
I love this car.	M’ani gye kar yi ho.
He was happy to go with her.	Ná n’ani gye sɛ ɔne no bɛkɔ.
No one has ever done that.	Obiara nni hɔ a wayɛ saa da.
But this is hardly the whole story.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ eyi nyɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
It might be more fun at school, with your friends.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ anigye kɛse wɔ sukuu mu, ne wo nnamfo.
Your dad would love that.	Wo papa ani begye ho saa.
Someone, everyone.	Obi, obiara.
I have footage of that in the film.	Mewɔ saa asɛm no ho mfonini wɔ sini no mu.
The day after the first day.	Da a edi da a edi kan no akyi.
Being a mom is hard.	Maame a wobɛyɛ no yɛ den.
He took the matter to himself.	Ɔde asɛm no too ne ho so.
I had no problem with that.	Ná minni ɔhaw biara wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
This letter is flawless.	Saa krataa yi nni mfomso biara.
That is not up for debate today.	Ɛno nyɛ asɛm a wɔde gye akyinnye nnɛ.
It’s a story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm.
She is as beautiful as ever.	Ɔyɛ fɛ te sɛ kan no.
I just focused on them.	Mede m’adwene sii wɔn so kɛkɛ.
It’s never on the road.	Ɛnyɛ kwan so da.
However, it was too late.	Nanso, na aka akyi dodo.
He ran toward her.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ ne nkyɛn.
One of those people is me.	Saa nnipa no mu biako ne me.
Finally, that was it.	Awiei koraa, na ɛno ne saa.
Talk to anyone you find interested.	Kasa kyerɛ obiara a wuhu sɛ n’ani gye ho.
This road is not in the best of circumstances.	Saa kwan yi nni tebea a eye sen biara mu.
It has everything in it.	Ɛwɔ biribiara wɔ mu.
We can’t control any of that.	Yɛrentumi nni saa nneɛma no mu biara so.
My father was very happy.	Ná me papa ani gye kɛse.
There is not enough time.	Bere a ɛdɔɔso nni hɔ.
People started getting bigger.	Nkurɔfo fii ase yɛɛ kɛse.
Let everyone inside.	Ma obiara nkɔ mu.
He ran into the front room.	Ɔde mmirika kɔɔ anim dan no mu.
He wanted to win.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ odi nkonim.
Glad you told me.	Anigye sɛ woka kyerɛɛ me.
But they hurt anyway.	Nanso wɔyɛ yaw ɔkwan biara so.
Display the most interesting images first.	Di kan yi mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ anigye sen biara adi.
And this can be really dangerous.	Na eyi betumi ayɛ nea asiane wom ankasa.
You two need to get out of town.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mo baanu fi kurow no mu.
None of us have ever felt that way.	Yɛn mu biara nte nka saa da.
A different method is used.	Wɔde ɔkwan foforo di dwuma.
Many animals stay at night.	Mmoa pii tra hɔ anadwo.
I just want to be home.	Mepɛ sɛ mewɔ fie ara kwa.
You are on the road now.	Wowɔ kwan so mprempren.
In this case it is a good thing.	Wɔ eyi mu no ɛyɛ ade pa.
That’s how long.	Ɛno ne bere tenten ahe.
He wasn’t that kind of person.	Ná ɔnyɛ onipa a ɔte saa.
Hard and simple things.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ den ne nea ɛnyɛ den.
You were a boy.	Ná woyɛ abarimaa.
There was nothing anyone could do then.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a obiara betumi ayɛ saa bere no.
Don’t show yourself.	Mfa wo ho nkyerɛ.
I still don't understand why.	Meda so ara nte nea enti a ɛte saa no ase.
No one knows what the situation will be like.	Obiara nnim sɛnea tebea no bɛyɛ.
I knew this was my time.	Ná minim sɛ eyi ne me bere.
He took the opportunity to take the initiative.	Ɔde hokwan no yɛɛ ade a edi kan.
Don’t worry about anything else.	Mma w’ani nnye biribi foforo biara ho.
He touched the book.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa nhoma no.
Here is the list of ingredients.	Nneɛma a wɔde yɛ aduan no din ni.
It’s dangerous.	Ɛyɛ asiane.
Put it down.	Fa no to fam.
But, you know, is what it is.	Nanso, wunim, ne nea ɛyɛ.
You have to want to.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wopɛ.
It may be best to do one thing at a time.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ ade biako bere koro mu.
I think that’s the problem.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
They both do very well.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ yiye paa.
Things seem to be moving quickly.	Ɛte sɛ nea nneɛma rekɔ so ntɛmntɛm.
You don’t like this.	W’ani nnye eyi ho.
I really enjoyed this movie.	M’ani gyee sini yi ho ankasa.
I'm not very good at not having a plan.	Menyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw kɛse wɔ nhyehyɛe biara a minni mu.
Here is why it is so.	Nea enti a ɛte saa ni.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
We were both doing well on our own.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa reyɛ yiye wɔ yɛn ankasa mu.
You have two.	Wowɔ abien.
He wanted to agree with her but had no better plan.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne no yɛ adwene nanso na onni nhyehyɛe biara a eye sen saa.
I wanted to do well in this exam.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ yiye wɔ sɔhwɛ yi mu.
Don’t get your hands on this.	Mma wo nsa nka eyi.
I have absolutely no intention of doing the same.	Minni adwene biara koraa sɛ mɛyɛ saa ara.
I don’t think you do.	Minsusuw sɛ woyɛ saa.
But this is not of great importance.	Nanso eyi nyɛ ade a ɛho hia kɛse.
I may be the only one on this one.	Ebia me nkutoo na mewɔ eyi so.
He doesn’t do any good.	Ɔnyɛ papa biara.
But it wasn’t him .	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɔno .
This is not a children’s issue.	Eyi nyɛ mmofra asɛm.
Thank you so much for that.	Meda mo ase pii wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
But no one can do that.	Nanso obiara ntumi nyɛ saa.
Everyone seemed to be going.	Na ɛte sɛ nea obiara rekɔ.
You can configure this feature to do things.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa ade yi ho nhyehyɛe de ayɛ nneɛma.
All in all, it’s still pretty cool.	Ne nyinaa mu no, ɛda so ara yɛ fɛ yiye.
That is how the work will continue.	Saa na adwuma no bɛkɔ so.
I can never forget this child.	Me werɛ ntumi mfi abofra yi da.
There are many of them.	Wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
He didn't know how or when.	Ná onnim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ anaa bere bɛn.
I will set you up for many things.	Mede wo besi nneɛma pii so.
It doesn’t seem to be happening.	Ɛnte sɛ nea ɛrekɔ so.
And the other one isn’t much better.	Na foforo no nso nyɛ papa pii.
He also enjoys walking.	N’ani gye nantew nso ho.
I'm just here to give you a little information.	Mewɔ ha sɛ mede nsɛm kakra bɛma wo kɛkɛ.
I have to say this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka eyi.
I can make no apologies for it.	Mintumi mpa kyɛw biara wɔ ho.
But the gun was there.	Nanso na tuo no wɔ hɔ.
He gave her his hand.	Ɔde ne nsa maa no.
The point is simple.	Asɛm no yɛ mmerɛw.
She was as beautiful to me as she had ever been.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ ma me sɛnea na ne ho yɛ fɛ pɛn no.
I want you to believe that.	Mepɛ sɛ wugye saa asɛm no di.
Both of those things can’t really be true.	Saa nneɛma abien no nyinaa ntumi nyɛ nokware ankasa.
Suppose this is not true.	Fa no sɛ eyi nyɛ nokware.
He liked that about her.	N’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho wɔ ne ho.
It is a threat to our system.	Ɛyɛ asiane ma yɛn nhyehyɛe no.
You can do two things.	Wubetumi ayɛ nneɛma abien.
This is not an issue in the instant case.	Eyi nyɛ asɛm wɔ asɛm a ɛwɔ hɔ ntɛm ara no mu.
You don’t need to invest a huge amount of money.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode sika kɛse bi bɛka ho.
More pictures of me below.	Me ho mfonini pii wɔ ase ha.
Giving him more power.	Tumi pii a wɔde bɛma no.
It’s always a little, well.	Ɛyɛ kakra, yiye bere nyinaa.
That’s old school.	Ɛno ne sukuu dedaw.
It hurts me so much.	Ɛyɛ me yaw kɛse.
There is something bigger that he has no idea about.	Ade kɛse bi wɔ hɔ a onni ho adwene biara.
I couldn’t get a shot out of it.	Na mintumi nnya tuo biara mfi mu.
I wasn’t thinking clearly.	Ná minsusuw nneɛma ho yiye.
Things are not as they used to be.	Nneɛma nte sɛnea na ɛte no.
He wasn’t doing that anymore.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa bio.
The same is true in this case.	Saa nso na ɛte wɔ asɛm yi mu.
We humans are strong.	Yɛn a yɛyɛ nnipa no, yɛn ho yɛ den.
Something terrible and terrifying.	Biribi a ɛyɛ hu na ɛyɛ hu.
I can’t say for sure.	Mintumi nka no yiye.
Commit to action.	Fa wo ho to so sɛ wobɛyɛ ade.
No one ever says that.	Obiara nka saa da.
I always love working with your people.	M’ani gye ho sɛ me ne wo nkurɔfo bɛyɛ adwuma bere nyinaa.
So that’s one thing, and that’s another.	Enti ɛno yɛ ade biako, na ɛno nso yɛ ade foforo.
There is a serious danger in this.	Asiane kɛse bi wɔ eyi mu.
It’s still going on.	Ɛda so ara kɔ so.
However, it was not his way.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ ne kwan no.
He could tell her now, though.	Nanso, na obetumi aka akyerɛ no mprempren.
But people thought he would use both of these terms.	Nanso nkurɔfo susuwii sɛ ɔde nsɛm abien yi nyinaa bedi dwuma.
Never my friends.	Ɛnyɛ me nnamfo da.
I have my plans.	Mewɔ me nhyehyɛe ahorow.
His head and one arm were missing.	Ná ne ti ne ne nsa biako nni hɔ.
I'm in the middle of it.	Mewɔ mu.
What do you think of this book?	Dɛn na wususuw wɔ nhoma yi ho?
He wasn’t in the house at all.	Na onni fie hɔ koraa.
Everyone sang.	Obiara too dwom.
He is exactly what you think he is.	Ɔyɛ nea wususuw sɛ ɔyɛ no ankasa.
This was someone else entirely.	Ná eyi yɛ obi foforo koraa.
It’s just an idea.	Ɛyɛ adwene bi kɛkɛ.
I’ve never left his.	M’ani mfi ne de no mu da.
It’s all getting better.	Ne nyinaa reyɛ yiye.
You were amazing.	Ná wo ho yɛ nwonwa.
This might be for the best.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
You can watch it later.	Wubetumi ahwɛ no akyiri yi.
And that has worked for us so far.	Na ɛno ayɛ adwuma ama yɛn de besi nnɛ.
That had happened.	Ná asi saa.
I think it’s really interesting.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
This method is very old.	Saa kwan yi akyɛ paa.
It looks amazing and my legs are always beautiful now.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa na me nan yɛ fɛ bere nyinaa mprempren.
Please take me back to my room.	Mesrɛ wo, fa me san kɔ me dan mu.
I wanted to go further.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ akyiri.
A girl like you.	Abeawa bi te sɛ wo.
We provide the rest for free.	Yɛde nea aka no ma kwa.
He had worked three jobs to get through school.	Ná wayɛ nnwuma abiɛsa de akɔ sukuu mu.
On the street.	Wɔ abɔnten so.
It was the only game in town.	Ná ɛno nkutoo ne agoru a na ɛwɔ kurow no mu.
It’s just very, very powerful.	Ɛyɛ tumi kɛse, kɛse ara kwa.
And here I am now.	Na ha na mewɔ mprempren.
As it should be.	Sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
Your mother told me too.	Wo maame nso ka kyerɛɛ me.
He welcomed his friends with joy.	Ɔde anigye gyee ne nnamfo.
This looks like it should.	Eyi te sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
I have used the telephone before.	Mede telefon adi dwuma pɛn.
Think about it really.	Susuw ho ankasa.
He becomes a resource.	Ɔbɛyɛ ade a wɔde di dwuma.
He is in good shape with her.	Ɔne no wɔ tebea pa mu.
He is a self-reliant person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔde ne ho to so.
They enjoy the work.	Wɔyɛ adwuma no mu anigye.
His schoolwork was poor.	Ná ne sukuu adwuma no nyɛ papa.
This is important to him.	Eyi ho hia no.
The ones you use the most.	Wɔn a wode di dwuma kɛse no.
I am not sure why.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa no yiye.
We have children the same age.	Yɛwɔ mma a wɔn mfe yɛ pɛ.
It’s just as simple as that.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw ara kwa sɛnea ɛte no.
This happened first.	Eyi sii kan.
If he is at the bottom.	Sɛ ɔwɔ ase hɔ a.
It’s just too hard.	Ɛyɛ den dodo ara kwa.
He lives here.	Ɔte ha.
Get to work right away.	Kɔ adwuma ntɛm ara.
He was the same, too.	Ná ɔno nso te saa ara.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
Even then, there are still mistakes.	Saa bere no mpo, mfomso da so ara wɔ hɔ.
This is how we develop our systems.	Eyi ne sɛnea yɛyɛ yɛn nhyehyɛe ahorow no.
I can’t play the game where you have to think and think.	Mintumi nni agoru a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho na wususuw ho no.
Think about what your day looks like.	Susuw sɛnea wo da no te ho.
It will be great.	Ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
Once you are involved.	Sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu pɛ a.
He didn’t even know his mother.	Ná onnim ne maame mpo.
It’s been such a long year.	Afe tenten saa ni.
However, I could touch him.	Nanso, na metumi de ne nsa aka no.
It’s beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ.
It needs to be made very strong.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no ma ɛyɛ den yiye.
It’s cold and wet .	Ɛyɛ awɔw na ɛyɛ nsu .
An easy day.	Da a ɛnyɛ den.
Just not really my thing.	Kɛkɛ ɛnyɛ me ade ankasa.
We do have a plan.	Yɛwɔ nhyehyɛe bi ampa.
Those kids of mine stay for hours.	Saa me mma no tra hɔ nnɔnhwerew pii.
This is not much fun.	Eyi nyɛ anigye pii.
A sense of emptiness is still a thing.	Te a obi te nka sɛ hwee nni hɔ no da so ara yɛ ade.
Let your child be a child.	Ma wo ba nyɛ abofra.
Old things have passed away.	Nneɛma dedaw atwam.
I love his music.	M’ani gye ne nnwom ho.
What kind of city is this?	Kurow bɛn na eyi yɛ?
I know what happened.	Me nim nea esii no.
We have two more children.	Yɛwɔ mma baanu foforo.
I don’t have a job.	Minni adwuma.
Powers come home.	Tumi ahorow ba fie.
We are living in a very exciting time.	Yɛwɔ bere a ɛyɛ anigye kɛse mu.
That can be good and bad.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ papa ne bɔne.
Check them out now.	Hwɛ wɔn mprempren.
He smirked at himself.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ ne ho so.
I knew it wasn’t.	Ná minim sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
It all has to go away.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ne nyinaa kɔ.
Keep your eyes peeled.	Kɔ so na w’ani nna hɔ.
He didn’t like her.	Ná n’ani nnye ne ho.
I couldn’t keep going.	Na mintumi nkɔ so.
He knew exactly what he was weak at.	Na onim nea ɔyɛ mmerɛw wɔ ho no ankasa.
We can provide pictures.	Yebetumi de mfonini ahorow ama.
The same thing was true.	Saa ara na na ɛte.
He was excited.	Ná n’ani agye.
It was a short-term experience.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi.
Thanks again for this article.	Meda wo ase bio wɔ asɛm yi ho.
I watch him really closely.	Mehwɛ no yiye ankasa.
This job is difficult.	Saa adwuma yi yɛ den.
In that room.	Wɔ saa dan no mu.
Things were going well.	Ná nneɛma rekɔ so yiye.
It was not an easy task.	Ná ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
You can enter it with a completely different approach.	Wubetumi de ɔkwan foforo koraa akɔ mu.
It is neither difficult nor easy.	Ɛnyɛ den anaasɛ ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
That didn’t surprise him.	Ɛno anyɛ no nwonwa.
They are necessary evils, and may not be evils.	Wɔyɛ bɔne a ɛho hia, na ebia ɛnyɛ bɔne.
He never owned a car.	Ná onni kar da.
That goes too far.	Ɛno kɔ akyiri dodo.
Someone else said he was.	Obi foforo nso kae sɛ ɔte saa.
But it wasn’t working.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ adwuma.
However, their task was not easy.	Nanso, na wɔn adwuma no nyɛ mmerɛw.
This was not really the plan.	Ná eyi nyɛ nhyehyɛe no ankasa.
And he wrapped his arms around her.	Na ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne mu.
Put a good story in it.	Fa asɛm pa bi to mu.
And that was the end of the problem.	Na ɛno ne ɔhaw no awiei.
It was good for him to stay busy.	Ná eye ma no sɛ ɔbɛkɔ so anya adagyew.
He needs to sleep too.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno nso da.
It is not our pleasure to do this.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn anigye sɛ yɛbɛyɛ eyi.
A few stayed there.	Kakraa bi traa hɔ.
As they say, who knew?.	Sɛnea wɔka no, hena na na onim?.
But really good people.	Nanso nnipa pa ankasa.
What year is this year?	Afe bɛn na afe yi yɛ?
Something needs to be done about that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi fa saa asɛm no ho.
Next, consider their reactions.	Nea edi hɔ no, susuw sɛnea wɔyɛ wɔn ade no ho.
I nodded anyway.	Mede me ti too fam ɔkwan biara so.
Not that there is anything wrong with this.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ mfomso bi wɔ eyi ho.
I can’t believe these problems still exist.	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɔhaw ahorow yi da so ara wɔ hɔ.
You don’t want a man.	Wompɛ ɔbarima.
This is not a big deal.	Eyi nyɛ asɛm kɛse.
Sex was out of the question.	Ná nna ho asɛm nni asɛm.
Keep up the good work!	Kɔ so yɛ adwuma pa no!
Everyone does that.	Onipa biara yɛ saa.
I don’t need to tell you what happened.	Ɛho nhia sɛ meka nea esii no kyerɛ wo.
What a wonderful animal!	Aboa a ɔyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni!
Very entertaining movie, very entertaining.	Sini a ɛyɛ anigye yiye, ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
That’s a big thing for me.	Ɛno yɛ ade kɛse ma me.
He was not a real man.	Ná ɔnyɛ ɔbarima ankasa.
Maybe I do that.	Ebia meyɛ saa.
Too many cars on the road.	Kar pii dodo wɔ kwan so.
Just maybe, but not here.	Ebia kɛkɛ, nanso ɛnyɛ ha.
They were interested in it.	Ná wɔn ani gye ho.
Or he’s the one.	Anaasɛ ɔno.
What a wonderful day.	Da pa bɛn ara ni.
It was really hard.	Ná ɛyɛ den ankasa.
The system works.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛ adwuma.
There is no problem with this.	Ɔhaw biara nni eyi ho.
But in this case, he could.	Nanso wɔ eyi mu no, na obetumi.
That’s how they do it.	Saa na wɔyɛ no.
He knew how good he was, but it was never about him.	Ná onim sɛnea ɔyɛ papa, nanso na ɛnyɛ ne ho asɛm da.
I don’t really .	Menyɛ saa ankasa .
That danger had passed, but not the one.	Ná saa asiane no atwam, nanso na ɛnyɛ biako no.
I’m so excited about it.	M’ani gye ho paa.
But one thing	Nanso ade biako .
You have the right to know.	Wowɔ hokwan sɛ wuhu.
Nothing is that complicated.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ den saa.
But there was a weakness.	Nanso na biribi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw wɔ hɔ.
That is quite a few.	Ɛno yɛ kakraa bi koraa.
He didn’t know anything.	Ná onnim hwee.
After all, he was very busy.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na onni adagyew koraa.
And it wasn’t a lie.	Na na ɛnyɛ atoro.
But, you know, it’s true.	Nanso, wunim, ɛyɛ nokware.
That would be easy.	Ɛno bɛyɛ mmerɛw.
You can have whatever you want.	Wubetumi anya nea wopɛ biara.
But maybe it’s the same.	Nanso ebia ɛte saa ara.
And he used it.	Na ɔde dii dwuma.
As you know, it’s night here.	Sɛnea wunim no, ɛyɛ anadwo wɔ ha.
But he was a child.	Nanso na ɔyɛ abofra.
Remember, it’s always good to say what you think.	Kae sɛ ɛyɛ papa bere nyinaa sɛ wobɛka nea wususuw.
That was something the people did not understand.	Ná ɛno yɛ biribi a nnipa no nte ase.
Children have to go to school every day.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra kɔ sukuu da biara.
But that doesn’t matter much.	Nanso ɛno ho nhia pii.
He knew a thing or two.	Na onim ade biako anaa abien.
But it doesn’t do me any good.	Nanso ɛnyɛ papa biara mma me.
I really hope this is true.	Mewɔ anidaso ankasa sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
One of them came up to him.	Wɔn mu biako baa ne nkyɛn.
Or music like that.	Anaasɛ nnwom a ɛte saa.
The water heats up when it warms up.	Nsu no yɛ hyew bere a ɛyɛ hyew no.
The water was starting to recede.	Ná nsu no afi ase rekɔ fam.
No one needs these things.	Obiara nhia saa nneɛma yi.
Only one gun left.	Tuo biako pɛ na aka.
My bedroom is here.	Me mpa no wɔ ha.
Half of the night was over.	Ná anadwo no fã aba awiei.
The man just said nothing.	Ɔbarima no anka hwee kɛkɛ.
This is nothing new either.	Eyi nso nyɛ ade foforo.
I venture to say something else.	Mede me ho to so sɛ mɛka biribi foforo.
I feel him now.	Mete ne nka mprempren.
I don't want that man involved in any way.	Mempɛ sɛ saa ɔbarima no de ne ho hyɛ mu ɔkwan biara so.
You can’t be good for yourself, or him.	Worentumi nyɛ papa mma wo ho, anaa ɔno nso.
I just want to know this.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu eyi ara kwa.
As the day goes on, the stories go on.	Bere a da no kɔ so no, nsɛm no kɔ so.
There are a lot of interesting things happening here.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye pii rekɔ so wɔ ha.
I have a beautiful mind.	Mewɔ adwene a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Hope one of you can help me.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ mo mu biako betumi aboa me.
He might as well do this better.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ ɔbɛyɛ eyi yiye.

Everything to be set up.	Biribiara a wɔde besi hɔ.
A repeated measurement test design.	A mpɛn pii susuw sɔhwɛ nhyehyɛe.
These people forget about themselves.	Saa nnipa yi werɛ fi wɔn ho.
Seems like a pretty good plan.	Ɛte sɛ nea nhyehyɛe pa bi a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Probably the best performance of the night.	Ebia agoru a eye sen biara wɔ anadwo no mu.
At least it should be.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
She was just beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ ara kwa.
Or he can have it on them.	Anaasɛ obetumi anya bi wɔ wɔn so.
In order to become great.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wobɛyɛ kɛse.
State the reasons for this.	Ka nea enti a ɛte saa.
But recently they got stronger.	Nanso nnansa yi ara wɔn ho yɛɛ den.
So that you matter to you.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wo ho hia wo.
I'm sure you'll tell the police at the first opportunity.	Migye di sɛ wobɛka akyerɛ polisifo wɔ hokwan a edi kan no mu.
I quickly decided on something else.	Meyɛɛ ntɛm sii biribi foforo ho gyinae.
It was beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ.
Many participated in all three.	Nnipa pii de wɔn ho hyɛɛ abiɛsa no nyinaa mu.
I would have said that.	Anka mɛka saa.
I have that too.	Me nso mewɔ saa.
You definitely have plenty of room.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wowɔ baabi a ɛdɔɔso.
Check out our services below.	Hwɛ yɛn nnwuma a ɛwɔ ase ha no.
It will be a pleasure to use.	Ɛbɛyɛ anigye sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
That’s how people celebrate those days.	Saa na nkurɔfo di saa nna no.
But they had presented him with the opportunity themselves.	Nanso na wɔn ankasa de hokwan no akyerɛ no.
I'm with my father.	Me ne me papa.
Just then, the phone rang.	Saa bere no ara, telefon no bɔɔ.
One opportunity people never talk about,.	Hokwan biako a nkurɔfo nka ho asɛm da,.
It is these people who carry the message.	Ɛyɛ saa nnipa yi na wɔde asɛm no kɔ.
They are always innovating.	Wɔyɛ nneɛma foforo bere nyinaa.
However, something was wrong.	Nanso, na biribi anyɛ yiye.
Everyone except him.	Obiara gye ɔno nkutoo.
You only have two feet, but lots of shoes.	Wowɔ nan abien pɛ, nanso mpaboa pii.
I want one too.	Me nso mepɛ biako.
Happy for the team.	Anigye ma kuw no.
That was the case today.	Saa na na ɛte nnɛ.
I have a mistake.	Mewɔ mfomso bi.
His language made the matter seem simple.	Ne kasa no maa asɛm no yɛɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a great game.	Ɛno nkyerɛ ankasa sɛ ɛyɛ agoru kɛse.
I want to get to know him better.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu no yiye.
I want it to be later.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ akyiri yi.
It’s you, right?	Ɛyɛ wo, ɛnte saa?
Still years later.	Ɛda so ara yɛ mfe pii akyi.
Our home was beautiful.	Ná yɛn fie yɛ fɛ yiye.
I saw the whole thing.	Mihuu ade no nyinaa.
However, as in the previous cases, these claims are not possible.	Nanso, sɛnea ɛte wɔ nsɛm a atwam no mu no, saa nsɛm yi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
It was an awesome learning experience.	Ná ɛyɛ adesua a ɛyɛ hu.
He knew he had a problem.	Ná onim sɛ ɔwɔ ɔhaw bi.
This thing is no longer available.	Saa ade yi nni hɔ bio.
If you are in a school, use the school name.	Sɛ wowɔ sukuu bi mu a, fa sukuu din no di dwuma.
He had never done that before.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa da.
It’s really old fashioned.	Ɛyɛ dedaw ankasa.
But this group did not understand.	Nanso na saa kuw yi nte ase.
The first is this.	Nea edi kan ne eyi.
None of that is new.	Ɛno mu biara nyɛ ade foforo.
This really brought me back on my feet.	Eyi de me san baa me nan ase ankasa.
He seems to have forgotten.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne werɛ afi.
Give this to the boy.	Fa eyi ma abarimaa no.
This is not just for fun.	Eyi nyɛ agoru ara kwa nti.
There may also be some problems.	Ebia ɔhaw ahorow bi nso wɔ hɔ.
A long time ago, a few times.	Bere tenten a atwam ni, mpɛn kakraa bi.
Perhaps we can	Ebia yebetumi .
But he was already gone, and there was nothing in the way.	Nanso na onni hɔ dedaw, na na hwee nni ɔkwan no so.
His children are about him.	Ne mma no fa ne ho.
And that’s not all.	Na ɛnyɛ ɛno nkutoo ne.
It’s still the same.	Ɛda so ara te saa.
And it’s a strong one.	Na ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
He is not a sinner.	Ɔnyɛ bɔne.
A child may know his father well.	Ebia abofra nim ne papa yiye.
He knew he was in danger.	Ná onim sɛ ɔwɔ asiane mu.
We spent a lot of time working on it.	Yɛde bere pii yɛɛ ho adwuma.
Feel very happy.	Te nka sɛ wowɔ anigye kɛse.
The first half was quick.	Ná fã a edi kan no yɛ ntɛm.
It all fell well.	Ne nyinaa hwee ase yiye.
It was too weird.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa dodo.
She went to him with joy and happiness.	Ɔde anigye ne anigye kɔɔ ne nkyɛn.
And it was true.	Na ɛyɛ nokware.
It was a city of possibilities.	Ná ɛyɛ kurow a nneɛma betumi ayɛ yiye wom.
The first meeting is very important.	Nhyiam a edi kan no ho hia yiye.
The same day.	Da koro no ara.
And many of them, too.	Na wɔn mu pii nso.
He thought he had problems.	Ná osusuw sɛ ɔwɔ ɔhaw ahorow.
He is an innocent man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho nni asɛm.
I’d be more than happy to do so.	M’ani begye kɛse sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
In many cases, you have to do the work.	Wɔ nsɛm pii mu no, ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma no.
Why so much? 	Dɛn nti na pii saa?
The phone rang loudly.	Telefon no bɔɔ denneennen.
Other than that, there was nothing.	Sɛ ɛno da nkyɛn a, na biribiara nni hɔ.
No one knows where he is.	Obiara nnim baabi a ɔwɔ.
I want it right here right now.	Mepɛ no wɔ ha yi ara seesei ara.
There was plenty of food.	Ná aduan pii wɔ hɔ.
The infrastructure will cost more.	Nneɛma a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma no bɛbɔ ka kɛse.
It’s not part of the story here.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm no fã wɔ ha.
He doesn’t do anything.	Ɔnyɛ hwee.
Not here, not now.	Ɛnyɛ ha, ɛnyɛ mprempren.
It’s just fine, in my opinion.	Ɛyɛ papa ara kwa, wɔ m’adwene mu.
It was a nice afternoon.	Ná ɛyɛ awia pa.
What did your father mean to you.	Dɛn na na wo papa kyerɛ ma wo.
It only mattered to him.	Ná ɛho hia no nkutoo.
The test will be difficult.	Sɔhwɛ no bɛyɛ den.
I think it’s the same.	Misusuw sɛ ɛte saa.
So like human and yet not human.	Enti te sɛ onipa na nanso ɛnyɛ onipa.
Look at the full size.	Hwɛ ne kɛse no nyinaa.
There was no problem with the project.	Ná ɔhaw biara nni adwuma no ho.
They were not pretty, but they were strong.	Ná wɔn ho nyɛ fɛ, nanso na wɔn ho yɛ den.
They are both beautiful.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa ho yɛ fɛ.
Just not enough of it.	Kɛkɛ a ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
This goes for good and evil.	Eyi kɔ ma papa ne bɔne.
Full of hope you can use it.	Anidaso ahyɛ no ma sɛ wubetumi de adi dwuma.
It's from here.	Yi fi ha.
This morning, indeed.	Anɔpa yi, ampa.
I have only one thing.	Mewɔ ade biako pɛ.
For a moment, no one spoke.	Bere tiaa bi no, obiara ankasa.
Several had recently arrived.	Ná dodow bi aba nnansa yi ara.
There are many, many people out there.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ, pii wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
It didn’t feel weird.	Na ɛnte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Almost no one knew where he lived.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na obiara nnim baabi a ɔte.
Put this child back in the system.	Fa saa abofra yi san kɔ nhyehyɛe no mu.
I still have problems with my language.	Meda so ara wɔ ɔhaw ahorow wɔ me kasa ho.
However, there are limited career opportunities.	Nanso, adwuma hokwan ahorow kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Look, that was never the game plan.	Hwɛ, ɛno nyɛ agoru nhyehyɛe no da.
Now, it doesn’t matter anymore.	Seesei, ɛho nhia bio.
It was just awesome.	Ná ɛyɛ hu ara kwa.
Water includes many different things.	Nneɛma ahorow pii ka nsu ho.
Below are some things to consider.	Nneɛma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho wɔ ase hɔ.
He does nothing for nothing.	Ɔnyɛ hwee kwa.
I had very few.	Ná mewɔ kakraa bi pɛ.
He’s been around for a long time.	Ɔwɔ hɔ akyɛ.
That in itself is just happening.	Ɛno ankasa yɛ nea ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
And so he will do it.	Na saa na ɔbɛyɛ.
Even if it’s bad, even if it’s really bad.	Sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne mpo a, sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne ankasa mpo a.
It’s pretty hot, isn’t it?	Ɛyɛ hyew yiye, ɛnte saa?
I am very weak.	Meyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
But something had told him not to.	Nanso na biribi aka akyerɛ no sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
But whatever, man.	Nanso nea ɛte biara, onipa.
No one performed well.	Obiara anyɛ adwuma yiye.
Food was often scarce in winter.	Ná aduan taa ho yɛ na wɔ awɔw bere mu.
Two things were true.	Ná nneɛma abien yɛ nokware.
Maybe anything will happen.	Ebia biribiara bɛba.
That would be good.	Ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
I can’t even say I’m sorry.	Mintumi nka mpo sɛ mepa wo kyɛw.
He shouldn't think about it now anyway.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ osusuw ho mprempren wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
This can be huge.	Eyi betumi ayɛ kɛse.
He is happy for her.	Ɔwɔ anigye ma no.
Hours and hours.	Nnɔnhwerew ne nnɔnhwerew pii.
They have to work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma.
I just can’t get any hands on it.	Mintumi nnya nsa biara kɛkɛ wɔ so.
Usually a very good time.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛyɛ bere pa yiye.
Maybe just a little bit.	Ebia kakra bi kɛkɛ.
That will be fine.	Ɛno bɛyɛ yiye.
They sang along with their favorite song.	Wɔde dwom a wɔn ani gye ho paa kaa ho too dwom.
He drives his car without an accident.	Ɔka ne kar no a akwanhyia biara nni mu.
So tell him.	Enti ka no.
This is not the same thing.	Eyi nyɛ ade koro.
If you agree with me, even better.	Sɛ wo ne me yɛ adwene a, eye mpo.
So you can see more background.	Enti wubetumi ahu akyi nsɛm pii.
Please don’t leave that door.	Mesrɛ wo, mma mfi saa ɔpon no mu.
Everything though, as it were.	Biribiara nanso, sɛnea ɛte no.
Always make it about them.	Yɛ no fa wɔn ho bere nyinaa.
It’s interesting that he says that.	Ɛyɛ anigye sɛ ɔka saa asɛm no.
I’m so glad you could come.	M’ani agye yiye sɛ wubetumi aba.
However, that is only part of the story.	Nanso, ɛno yɛ asɛm no fã bi kɛkɛ.
My father was a connoisseur of clothes.	Ná me papa yɛ obi a onim ntade yiye.
This is not what you have.	Eyi nyɛ nea wowɔ.
Get out of the city.	Fi kurow no mu.
Here are more details.	Nsɛm pii ni.
Here are the things that actually work.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ adwuma ankasa no ni.
This was not true.	Ná eyi nyɛ nokware.
That pretty much leveled things out.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno maa nneɛma yɛɛ pɛ.
You need to find another reason for the referral.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu ade foforo a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde wo kɔ.
I am doing my best to work on this.	Mereyɛ nea metumi biara sɛ mɛyɛ eyi ho adwuma.
And many people don’t.	Na nnipa pii nyɛ saa.
This isn’t me.	Eyi nyɛ me.
Except for my mother.	Gye me maame nkutoo.
We can do better with this.	Yebetumi de eyi ayɛ yɛn ho yiye.
If you want that much money, you have to add you.	Sɛ wopɛ saa sika pii a, ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ka ho.
That’s the big problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw kɛse no.
I had to save myself and I had to figure out how.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ migye me ho na na ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea mɛyɛ.
Years and years of experience.	Mfe ne mfe a wɔde ayɛ adwuma.
I'm here, man.	Mewɔ ha, ɔbarima.
It looks like a cute kid.	Ɛte sɛ abofra a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
What he is doing now.	Nea ɔyɛ mprempren.
This is only half the story.	Eyi yɛ asɛm no fã pɛ.
He was worried about her.	Ná ne ho asɛm haw no.
But in the grand scheme of things, it didn’t matter.	Nanso wɔ nneɛma nhyehyɛe kɛse no mu no, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
It was just a room, after all.	Na ɛyɛ dan bi kɛkɛ, ne nyinaa akyi no.
He was in the same shot as me.	Ná ɔne me wɔ tuo koro no ara mu.
The strange incident with the dog that night.	Asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa a esii wɔ ɔkraman no ho anadwo no.
This applies to me now.	Eyi fa me ho mprempren.
Everyone else has signed.	Obiara a aka no de ne nsa ahyɛ ase.
It was the most exciting thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye sen biara.
It was filled with something soft.	Ná biribi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ahyɛ mu ma.
I could watch it for hours.	Ná metumi ahwɛ no nnɔnhwerew pii.
The package has arrived.	Nneɛma a wɔde ahyɛ mu no aba.
You just can’t see them.	Worentumi nhu wɔn kɛkɛ.
I can help him with that.	Metumi aboa no wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Did you know what.	So na wunim nea.
At least this was true.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, eyi yɛɛ nokware.
That’s how much they gave me.	Saa dodow no ara na wɔde maa me.
Maybe that’s how this ended.	Ebia saa na eyi baa awiei.
That’s what he thought.	Saa na ɔno nso susuw ho.
Again, it’s very simple.	Bio nso, ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
It’s easy and it should be good.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ papa.
Back to the point.	San kɔ asɛm no so.
I don't know why he talked to me about it.	Minnim nea enti a ɔne me kaa ho asɛm.
Do give him the best.	Yɛ ma no nea eye sen biara.
As was the table.	Sɛnea na ɛte wɔ pon no so no.
Do we have enough water?	So yɛwɔ nsu a ɛdɔɔso?
A year of anticipation.	Afe a wɔde hwɛ kwan.
Eventually it’s your night.	Awiei koraa no ɛyɛ wo anadwo.
It may be accelerating this year.	Ebia ɛrekɔ so ntɛmntɛm afe yi.
He would be relieved.	Ná ne ho bɛtɔ no.
It was midnight.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo fã.
We have to take you back ourselves.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn ankasa de mo san kɔ.
I think about it	Misusuw ho .
Tell me about it.	Ka kyerɛɛ me.
But there was one big problem with this.	Nanso na ɔhaw kɛse biako wɔ eyi ho.
The dog runs away.	Ɔkraman no tu mmirika.
Just one more time.	Bere biako pɛ bio.
She was just amazing.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
I want that for my son.	Mepɛ saa ma me ba no.
Control the floor.	Di fam no so.
In the past year.	Wɔ afe a atwam no mu.
He could play that very well.	Ná obetumi abɔ saa yiye paa.
I was kept there for a day and a half.	Wɔde me too hɔ da koro ne fã.
I could use another coat.	Ná metumi de atade foforo adi dwuma.
Everyone was equal.	Ná obiara yɛ pɛ.
If this happens, be careful.	Sɛ eyi ba a, hwɛ yiye.
Again he was very competent.	Bio nso na ɔyɛ obi a ne ho akokwaw yiye.
The first day was nothing.	Na da a edi kan no nyɛ hwee.
I am an expert in this field.	Meyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw wɔ adwuma yi mu.
It’s absolutely fascinating.	Ɛyɛ anigye koraa.
So is the acquaintance behind the scenes.	Saa ara nso na nea onim no wɔ akyi.
I would do whatever he wanted.	Ná mɛyɛ nea ɔpɛ biara.
It’s a great job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
I did this several times.	Meyɛɛ eyi mpɛn pii.
It’s not much work.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma pii.
It’s a great job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
You’ll be relieved.	Wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
Only the car.	Kar no nkutoo.
This will be the same.	Eyi bɛyɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
It has done a lot of work.	Ayɛ adwuma pii.
However, this approach has some disadvantages.	Nanso, saa kwan yi wɔ ɔhaw ahorow bi.
The information is still there.	Nsɛm no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Often.	Mpɛn pii.
So it shouldn’t be.	Enti ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
It had been easy.	Ná ayɛ mmerɛw.
I’ve created them.	Mewɔ wo.
They seem beautiful.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
It’s not just something you say out loud.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a wobɛka no den kɛkɛ.
As long as you don’t like it.	Bere tenten a w’ani nnye ho no.
His hand took hers.	Ne nsa faa ne de no.
He slowly falls to the ground.	Ɔde ne ho to fam.
No need to travel home by bus.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode bɔs tu kwan kɔ fie.
What has he brought with him?	Dɛn na ɔde aba?
You should have known that.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu saa.
His son was with him.	Ná ne ba no ka ne ho.
He was everything he wanted to be.	Ná ɔyɛ biribiara a ɔpɛ.
The views are spectacular.	Nea wubetumi ahu wɔ hɔ no yɛ nwonwa.
He is just like that.	Ɔte saa ara kwa.
Look at me sleeping.	Hwɛ me sɛ meda.
But it’s great.	Nanso ɛyɛ kɛse.
The party has just begun.	Apontow no afi ase ara kwa.
Maybe he could have done the same.	Ebia na ɔno nso betumi ayɛ saa.
That was something that kind of happened.	Ná ɛno yɛ biribi a ɛte sɛ nea esii.
He was outside.	Ná ɔwɔ abɔnten.
He was suspended last year.	Wɔde no too afiase afe a etwaam no.
I know you’re working, though.	Minim sɛ woreyɛ adwuma, nanso.
I wish he would just go away.	Me yam a anka ɔbɛkɔ kɛkɛ.
This was three days ago.	Eyi yɛ nnansa a atwam ni.
Innovation, like hope itself, is power.	Nneɛma foforo a wɔyɛ, te sɛ anidaso ankasa no, yɛ tumi.
I just wanted to say it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka ara kwa.
And new clothes.	Na ntade foforo nso.
There is only a little time left.	Bere kakraa bi pɛ na aka.
If only at night.	Sɛ ɛyɛ anadwo nkutoo a.
My son is happy.	Me ba no ani agye.
In my opinion, that is the case here.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no, ɛte saa wɔ ha.
And it shouldn’t surprise anyone.	Na ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ obiara nwonwa.
There was no reason to do that.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
The water is terrible.	Nsu a ɛyɛ hu.
No one agreed with them, and it hurt.	Obiara ne wɔn nyɛ adwene, na na ɛyɛ yaw.
I think a lot of it.	Misusuw sɛ pii.
That was someone else.	Ná ɛno yɛ obi foforo.
I hope this post gave you that.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ saa nsɛm yi de saa maa wo.
He has to make music.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nnwom.
For him, it was the same.	Wɔ ne fam no, na ɛte saa ara.
That’s fine by me.	Ɛno yɛ papa wɔ me fam.
It was my opinion.	Ná ɛyɛ m’adwene.
Was that even possible? 	So na ɛno mpo betumi ayɛ yiye?
Something strange is happening behind that.	Biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa rekɔ so wɔ ɛno akyi.
This is great for a variety of products.	Eyi yɛ kɛse ma nneɛma ahorow a wɔde yɛ nneɛma ahorow.
But he wasn’t, of course.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ saa, ampa.
What a wonderful thing to do!	Hwɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ!
He knows now.	Onim mprempren.
He had no idea where he was taking her.	Ná onni baabi a ɔde no rekɔ no ho adwene biara.
I couldn’t do much more.	Ná mintumi nyɛ pii bio.
You don’t have sex with him.	Wo ne no nna.
Eventually, we were given our own.	Awiei koraa no, wɔde yɛn ankasa de maa yɛn.
It is completely unnecessary today.	Ɛho nhia koraa nnɛ.
I just want one.	Mepɛ biako pɛ.
Under my windowsill.	Wɔ me mfɛnsere ase.
They’re interested in it.	Wɔn ani gye ho.
He’s just not part of our story.	Ɔnyɛ yɛn asɛm no fã kɛkɛ.
If he were a dog his hair would be over.	Sɛ ɔyɛ ɔkraman a anka ne ti nhwi bɛba awiei.
The only thing is the present tense.	Ade biako pɛ a ɛwɔ hɔ ne mprempren bere.
This is the best option in my opinion.	Eyi ne ɔkwan a eye sen biara wɔ m’adwene mu.
I like your letter.	M'ani gye wo krataa no ho.
There is nothing else one can say.	Biribiara foforo biara nni hɔ a obi betumi aka.
One lives every day.	Obi tra ase da biara da.
But tomorrow never really came.	Nanso ɔkyena amma da ankasa.
They are more current.	Wɔyɛ mprempren de kɛse.
He was right there.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ ara pɛ.
It’s very good.	Ɛyɛ papa papa.
This is true, very true.	Eyi yɛ nokware, ɛyɛ nokware paa.
He will go further.	Ɔbɛkɔ akyiri.
It was his home for so long.	Ná ɛyɛ ne fie bere tenten saa.
They didn’t seem to care.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm.
One of my favorite things to do.	Nneɛma a m’ani gye ho paa sɛ mɛyɛ no mu biako.
Make a lot of money.	Yɛ sika pii.
You are a great person.	Woyɛ onipa kɛse.
It’s definitely a big deal.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ ade kɛse.
A little more, please?	Kakraa bi ka ho, mesrɛ wo?
Hours can be long.	Nnɔnhwerew betumi ayɛ tenten.
The story seems more crowded this year.	Ɛte sɛ nea asɛm no yɛ nea nnipa ahyɛ mu ma kɛse afe yi.
This is a really, really bad idea.	Eyi yɛ adwene bɔne ankasa, ankasa.
And no one did that.	Na obiara anyɛ saa.
This is a more difficult book.	Eyi yɛ nhoma a ɛyɛ den kɛse.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na yɛyɛ eyi.
Each of us felt it.	Yɛn mu biara tee nka.
This as a child is already happening.	Eyi sɛ abofra no rekɔ so dedaw.
I knew how to get there now.	Ná minim sɛnea mɛkɔ hɔ mprempren.
I still have a lot of friends there.	Meda so ara wɔ nnamfo pii wɔ hɔ.
There is no doubt that	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, .
A lot of time.	Bere pii.
You always treated me like a man.	Bere nyinaa na wo ne me di sɛ ɔbarima.
The thing is very old.	Ade no akyɛ yiye.
He pointed to his smart wardrobe.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ ne ntade a ɛyɛ nyansa a wɔde yɛ ntade no ase.
Meanwhile, he’s in the process.	Saa bere yi nyinaa, ɔyɛ nhyehyɛe no mu.
You don’t really know why.	Wunnim nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa.
I was very much under his eyes.	Ná mewɔ n’ani ase kɛse.
It’s human rights.	Ɛyɛ nnipa hokwan ahorow.
And so tell me.	Na saa na ka kyerɛ me.
I think it was really good.	Misusuw sɛ na eye ankasa.
An optimist always sees the good in people.	Obi a ɔwɔ anidaso hu nneɛma pa wɔ nnipa mu bere nyinaa.
Certainly, no music.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, nnwom biara nni hɔ.
It looks really awesome.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu ankasa.
That was really exciting.	Ná ɛno yɛ anigye ankasa.
And another chapter.	Na ti foforo nso.
What would you do there.	Dɛn na anka wobɛyɛ wɔ hɔ.
In two days he recovered completely.	Wɔ nna abien mu no ne ho tɔɔ no koraa.
Apparently that didn’t work out so well.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛno ankɔ yiye saa.
He was gone, certainly gone eventually.	Ná onni hɔ bio, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ awiei koraa no na onni hɔ bio.
It is done in this way.	Wɔyɛ no saa kwan yi so.
But it may be a very long way.	Nanso ebia ɛbɛyɛ kwan tenten paa.
This man's life is in danger.	Saa ɔbarima yi nkwa da asiane mu.
For both of them it seemed to work.	Wɔ wɔn baanu nyinaa fam no na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma.
Everyone stared at them.	Obiara ani hwɛɛ wɔn denneennen.
That is very interesting.	Ɛno yɛ anigye yiye.
But look at the big picture.	Nanso hwɛ mfonini kɛse no.
But nothing can go outside.	Nanso biribiara ntumi nkɔ abɔnten.
It’s going to his room.	Ɛrekɔ ne dan mu.
These people are on to something else.	Saa nkurɔfo yi wɔ biribi foforo so.
Shortly thereafter, the man came out.	Ɛno akyi bere tiaa bi no, ɔbarima no fii adi.
Not that they cared much about what he was doing.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na nea ɔreyɛ no ho hia wɔn kɛse.
I can do nothing for you.	Mintumi nyɛ hwee mma wo.
For him, and for his mother.	Ɔno nti, ne ne maame nso.
Check out some photos below.	Hwɛ mfonini ahorow bi wɔ ase hɔ.
My dog ​​had to like him.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ me kraman no ani gye ne ho.
It must have been a bit of both.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ abien no nyinaa kakra.
No one should have to deal with this.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara di eyi ho dwuma.
That would solve a lot of problems.	Ná ɛno bedi ɔhaw pii ho dwuma.
Many movies.	Sini pii.
This is the point	Eyi ne asɛm no .
He didn't like her words at all.	Ná ɔmpɛ ne nsɛm no koraa.
This means that	Eyi kyerɛ sɛ .
However, he wasn’t.	Nanso, na ɔnyɛ saa.
Twice, maybe.	Mpɛn abien, ebia.
This, or something similar, seems equally true of the mind.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi, anaa biribi a ɛte saa ara yɛ nokware saa ara wɔ adwene no ho.
I do both of them.	Meyɛ abien no nyinaa.
There are two issues.	Nsɛm abien na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Most people are not honest with me.	Nnipa dodow no ara nni nokware mma me.
Wear it as you like.	Hyɛ no sɛnea wopɛ.
I had children.	Ná mewɔ mma.
A shoe on the floor.	Mpaboa bi a ɛwɔ fam.
Again everything was over.	Bio nso na biribiara aba awiei.
You can do that one day.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa da bi.
I still have a lot of friends there.	Meda so ara wɔ nnamfo pii wɔ hɔ.
You can do anything, there.	Wubetumi ayɛ biribiara, wɔ hɔ.
After you, things will be what they will be.	Wo akyi no, nneɛma bɛyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ.
This is indeed the case.	Eyi te saa ampa.
But no one could claim to know him well.	Nanso na obiara ntumi nka sɛ onim no yiye.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
We shouldn’t be doing that either.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛn nso yɛyɛ saa.
We hope you enjoy these products.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye saa nneɛma yi ho.
I see it really well.	Mihu no yiye ankasa.
He knew, even then, the night before.	Ná onim, saa bere no mpo, anadwo a edi kan no.
However, their presence is really important.	Nanso, wɔn a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho hia ankasa.
I understand what happened there.	Mete nea esii wɔ hɔ no ase.
She touched her son.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne ba no.
He plopped down on the bed.	Ɔde ne ho bɔɔ mpa no so.
He didn't know what else he could do.	Ná onnim nea obetumi ayɛ bio.
And it wasn’t me.	Na ɛnyɛ me.
He had been a boy.	Ná wayɛ abarimaa.
That didn’t work either.	Ɛno nso anyɛ adwuma.
There was no end in sight.	Ná awiei biara nni hɔ.
But we liked the set up.	Nanso yɛn ani gyee sɛnea wɔde sii hɔ no ho.
That’s not a thing.	Ɛno nyɛ ade bi.
It is filled with water.	Wɔde nsu ahyɛ mu ma.
A good book is a good book.	Nhoma pa yɛ nhoma pa.
Your wife and children are with you.	Wo yere ne wo mma ka wo ho.
There is nothing left to play with.	Biribiara nni hɔ a aka a wode bedi agoru.
Just a child.	Abofra bi kɛkɛ.
Do you believe that.	So wugye saa asɛm no di.
There would be more to do.	Anka nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
You never forget a night like that.	Wo werɛ mfi anadwo a ɛte saa da.
I believed it was something else.	Ná migye di sɛ ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
He was very impressed.	N’ani gyee ho paa.
It is far from perfect.	Ɛnyɛ nea edi mũ koraa.
This is the real thing.	Eyi ne ade ankasa.
Now that’s good police work.	Seesei ɛno yɛ polisifo adwuma pa.
Do what’s inside you.	Yɛ nea ɛwɔ wo mu no.
Like in the movies.	Te sɛ nea ɛwɔ sini ahorow mu no.
He is a very dangerous person.	Ɔyɛ onipa a ne ho yɛ hu paa.
He placed a package on the table.	Ɔde ade bi a wɔde ahyɛ mu too pon no so.
Something very strange has happened.	Biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye asi.
You can use one or the other.	Wubetumi de biako anaa foforo no adi dwuma.
The currency is plummeting.	Sika no rekɔ fam kɛse.
It’s like that some days.	Ɛte saa nna bi.
This is not how it’s supposed to work.	Eyi nyɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
Your feedback is very important to us.	Wo nsɛm a wobɛka no ho hia yɛn yiye.
However, this method can be costly.	Nanso, saa kwan yi betumi agye sika pii.
It is not limited to any time.	Ɛnyɛ bere biara nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
This seemed to be very important.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eyi ho hia paa.
I did my part.	Meyɛɛ me fam de.
But it was a very popular and popular thing.	Nanso na ɛyɛ ade a na nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse na wɔn ani gye ho.
But everyone else knows.	Nanso obiara a aka no nim.
Life after all.	Nkwa wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
And yet, it was still a game.	Na nanso, na ɛda so ara yɛ agoru.
Everyone seemed surprised.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obiara ho dwiriw no.
It is not surprising to us.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa mma yɛn.
Thank you for this.	Meda wo ase wɔ eyi ho.
I put my hand on his.	Mede me nsa too ne de no so.
It is greater than hope.	Ɛyɛ kɛse sen anidaso.
They focused on the style of the clothes.	Wɔde wɔn adwene sii sɛnea ntade no yɛ so.
He duly brought his will to her.	Ɔde ne pɛ baa ne nkyɛn sɛnea ɛsɛ.
It was a perfect strategy.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔkwan a edi mũ a wɔde di dwuma.
But it didn’t matter.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ no asɛm.
As long as everyone else plays the same way.	Bere tenten a obiara nso di agoru saa ara no.
And there are other issues.	Na nsɛm foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
This is the way it is going.	Eyi ne ɔkwan a ɛrekɔ so.
Not interesting enough.	Ɛnyɛ anigye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Many people believed the story to be true.	Ná nnipa pii gye di sɛ asɛm no yɛ nokware.
This case is such a case.	Saa asɛm yi yɛ asɛm a ɛte saa.
It sounds nice, and it seems very important to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛho hia me yiye.
Show him your book.	Fa wo nhoma no kyerɛ no.
Many friends go there.	Nnamfo pii kɔ hɔ.
It’s pretty amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
All this quick stuff.	Saa nneɛma a ɛyɛ ntɛm yi nyinaa.
But they may not be false themselves either.	Nanso ebia wɔn ankasa nso nyɛ atoro.
Hers was warm and soft.	Ná ne de no yɛ hyew na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
It was a test to see what might be there.	Ná ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ a wɔde hwɛ nea ebia ɛwɔ hɔ.
It’s absolutely the case.	Ɛte saa koraa.
So, no big deal.	Enti, asɛm kɛse biara nni hɔ.
At least not this time.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ saa bere yi.
No news came here for some time.	Asɛm biara amma ha bere bi.
You’re not beautiful.	Wo ho nyɛ fɛ.
It’s not much.	Ɛnyɛ pii.
There was definitely a lot to talk about.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka.
I think it’s true.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
It was real then, and it was real last night.	Na ɛyɛ ankasa saa bere no, na na ɛyɛ ankasa anadwo a etwaam no.
He says he knows these people.	Ɔka sɛ onim saa nkurɔfo yi.
It was one thing too many.	Ná ɛyɛ ade biako a ɛdɔɔso dodo.
He never planned.	Ná ɔnyɛ nhyehyɛe da.
Or you shouldn’t.	Anaasɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
No one knew what happened.	Ná obiara nnim nea esii.
He always had time for his children.	Ná ɔwɔ bere ma ne mma bere nyinaa.
That comes later.	Ɛno ba akyiri yi.
That man lives in that house.	Saa ɔbarima no te saa fie no mu.
All these things started happening.	Saa nneɛma yi nyinaa fii ase sii.
No idea of ​​the plan.	Nhyehyɛe no ho adwene biara nni hɔ.
Quantitative measurements.	Nneɛma dodow a wɔde susuw nneɛma.
Everything is very clear.	Biribiara mu da hɔ yiye.
Hope you know what you are doing.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wunim nea woreyɛ.
I can already see it.	Metumi ahu dedaw.
I don’t know what it was.	Minnim nea na ɛyɛ.
So maybe the money is involved in some way.	Enti ebia sika no ka ho wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
If we could leave, we would, but we can’t.	Sɛ yebetumi afi hɔ a, anka yɛbɛyɛ, nanso yɛrentumi.
Try to plan it, get to know it.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wobɛyɛ ho nhyehyɛe, hu no yiye.
However, his pain continued to worsen.	Nanso, ne yaw no kɔɔ so yɛɛ kɛse.
He put his hand on the lovely head.	Ɔde ne nsa too ti a ɛyɛ fɛ no so.
As before, the focus was again on the police.	Sɛnea na ɛte kan no, wɔde adwene sii polisifo so kɛse bio.
But the experiment was over.	Nanso na sɔhwɛ no aba awiei.
I can’t tell you how excited we are.	Mintumi nka sɛnea yɛn ani agye no nkyerɛ wo.
He never makes a mistake.	Ɔnyɛ mfomso da.
I just want to be told.	Mepɛ sɛ wɔka kyerɛ me ara kwa.
We hope you enjoy our session.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye yɛn nhyiam no ho.
He was amazing.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa.
This is the power and danger of information.	Eyi ne tumi ne asiane a ɛwɔ nsɛm mu.
It’s the people.	Ɛyɛ nnipa no.
In a.	Wɔ a.
The story is only half true.	Asɛm no yɛ nokware fã pɛ.
Just give the window shot.	Ma mfɛnsere mu tuo no ara kwa.
Mom never seems to have a problem.	Ɛte sɛ nea Maame nni ɔhaw biara da.
I was told everything looked fine.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ biribiara hwɛ yiye.
That was also a lie.	Ná ɛno nso yɛ atoro.
Someone knows all about us.	Obi nim yɛn ho nsɛm nyinaa.
When is it going to be? 	Bere bɛn na ɛyɛ?
. . . .	.
And you’ll be happy to do so.	Na w’ani begye ho sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
And movie time, too.	Na sini bere nso.
The night went on and on.	Anadwo no kɔɔ so yɛɛ kɛse.
Or a car.	Anaasɛ kar bi.
That’s why we exist.	Ɛno nti na yɛwɔ hɔ no.
There is a backstory here.	Asɛm a ɛwɔ akyi wɔ ha.
The system provides.	Nhyehyɛe no de ma.
Maybe he knew the girl wasn't his.	Ebia na onim sɛ abeawa no nyɛ ne de.
He could have found something for her.	Anka obetumi anya biribi ama no.
It was a house.	Ná ɛyɛ ofie bi.
Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot.	Susuw ho hwɛ sɛ na mpaboa no wɔ nan foforo no so a.
They are independent of each other.	Wɔde wɔn ho fi wɔn ho wɔn ho ho.
Unlike my wife.	Nea ɛnte sɛ me yere.
It hardly matters.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛho nhia.
She was their mother.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ wɔn maame.
As a result, the meeting was adjourned.	Ne saa nti, wɔde nhyiam no too nkyɛn.
Life is short.	Nkwa yɛ tiaa.
Pretend to be a painter.	Yɛ wo ho sɛ obi a ɔreyɛ mfonini.

It’s been there before.	Ɛwɔ hɔ pɛn.
But he was good.	Nanso na ɔyɛ papa.
I love that kind of thing.	M’ani gye saa ade no ho.
There’s a lot of that now.	Ɛno pii wɔ hɔ mprempren.
He patted the dog.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ɔkraman no.
People need to realize that water is scarce.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo hu sɛ nsu ho yɛ na.
It is thicker than water.	Ɛyɛ den sen nsu.
Each has amazing plans.	Wɔn mu biara wɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
You do it over and over again.	Woyɛ no mpɛn pii.
But it was not the first such attempt.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne mmɔden a ɛte saa a edi kan.
I might just say someone hit me.	Ebia mɛka kɛkɛ sɛ obi bɔɔ me.
But in a way, it is.	Nanso ɔkwan bi so no, ɛte saa.
He did the veterinary studies.	Ɔyɛɛ mmoa ho adesua ahorow no.
And all of it, too.	Na ne nyinaa nso.
I don’t like it when people do that to me.	Sɛ nkurɔfo yɛ me saa a, m’ani nnye ho.
I don’t think this will ever happen again.	Minsusuw sɛ eyi bɛba bio da.
Thank you very much.	Meda mo ase paa.
That’s all very interesting too.	Ɛno nyinaa nso yɛ anigye yiye.
I hope I can help.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ metumi aboa.
No one told me about it.	Obiara anka ho asɛm ankyerɛ me.
My wife made lunch.	Me yere yɛɛ awia aduan.
The story is full of surprises.	Asɛm no mu nsɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa ahyɛ mu ma.
I have shared more with him than anyone.	Me ne no akyɛ nneɛma pii sen obiara.
My house has room for you.	Me fie wɔ baabi ma wo.
Ask him for real.	Bisaa no ankasa.
I admire the man.	M’ani gye ɔbarima no ho.
He wondered who else he could manipulate.	Osusuw hena foforo a obetumi ayɛ ne ho adwuma no ho.
It’s late now.	Ɛyɛ akyiri mprempren.
It was their last season.	Ná ɛyɛ wɔn bere a etwa to a wɔde di agoru.
I don’t think there’s anything we can do about it.	Minsusuw sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
That’s the way it is.	Saa na ɛte.
It’s that simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
So, tell me how it feels.	Enti, ka sɛnea ɛte nka kyerɛ me.
He thinks the problem must be elsewhere.	Osusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔhaw no wɔ baabi foforo.
Time is money.	Bere yɛ sika.
My father's bed.	Me papa mpa so.
He is always late for school.	Ɔka akyi kɔ sukuu bere nyinaa.
That will be the end.	Ɛno na ɛbɛyɛ awiei.
Maybe no one does.	Ebia obiara nyɛ saa.
He has a terrible opinion of all of us.	Ɔwɔ adwene a ɛyɛ hu wɔ yɛn nyinaa ho.
This was his house.	Ná ne fie ni.
We didn’t like each other.	Ná yɛn ani nnye yɛn ho yɛn ho ho.
Monday is the busiest day.	Memeneda ne da a adagyew nnim koraa.
The condition of the very young and the very old was terrible.	Ná mmofra paa ne wɔn a wɔn mfe akɔ anim paa no tebea yɛ hu.
The whole car was headed towards him.	Ná kar no nyinaa de wɔn ani kyerɛ ne nkyɛn.
I knew that very well.	Ná minim saa yiye.
You need to add this project to your list of priorities.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode saa adwuma yi ka nneɛma a wode di kan no ho.
There is a method in the work.	Ɔkwan bi wɔ adwuma no mu.
The band sang for hours.	Kuw no too dwom nnɔnhwerew pii.
Again, not really complicated things.	Bio nso, ɛnyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ den ankasa.
It’s not easy, it’s not really easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw, ɛnyɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
Your money is not good today.	Wo sika nyɛ papa nnɛ.
I heard it many times.	Metee no mpɛn pii.
That was a good idea.	Ná ɛno yɛ adwene pa.
There is no doubt about that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I wanted to be strong.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ den.
In many cases, this was absolutely true.	Wɔ nsɛm pii mu no, na eyi yɛ nokware koraa.
I loved to draw.	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ mfonini.
He told her that he had to work late.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma akyiri.
I know he will do that.	Minim sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
It didn’t seem to matter.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia.
You know how great it is.	Wunim sɛnea ɛyɛ kɛse.
That’s what they should be doing.	Saa na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
It was difficult for me.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma me.
Sorry if you were in bed .	Pa kyɛw sɛ na wowɔ mpa so a .
Action must be taken now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi mprempren.
We are perfect here.	Yɛyɛ pɛ wɔ ha.
That’s pretty amazing.	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa yiye.
I saw that guy.	Mihuu saa ɔbarima no.
I don't know why this is.	Minnim nea enti a eyi te saa.
Whatever is important.	Nea ɛho hia biara.
There is less risk that way.	Asiane kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ saa kwan no so.
Last night the guy.	Anadwo a etwaam no.
This letter is for me.	Krataa yi yɛ ma me.
He was warm but cold.	Ná ne ho yɛ hyew nanso na awɔw wom.
What should we do today?	Dɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nnɛ?
The key is to solve the problem with programming help.	Nea ɛho hia ne sɛ wode nhyehyɛe mmoa bedi ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
A number of cars are parked along the street.	Wɔde kar dodow bi asi abɔnten no ho.
You put us back.	Wode yɛn san akyi.
It has a simple structure.	Ɛwɔ nhyehyɛe a ɛnyɛ den.
It did nothing to further the story.	Anyɛ hwee amma asɛm no akɔ anim.
For me, it wasn’t the same fun anymore.	Wɔ me fam no, na ɛnyɛ anigye koro no ara bio.
No work is necessary.	Adwuma biara ho nhia.
Your three years.	Wo mfe abiɛsa.
You can’t imagine it.	Worentumi nsusuw ho.
The police questioned me for hours.	Polisifo no bisaa me nsɛm nnɔnhwerew pii.
He lives there now.	Ɔte hɔ seesei.
It’s my last day.	Ɛyɛ me da a etwa to.
That makes it great.	Ɛno ma ɛyɛ kɛse.
The same was true now.	Saa ara na na ɛte mprempren.
That is not clear.	Ɛno mu nna hɔ.
He had no intention of using it anyway.	Ná onni adwene biara sɛ ɔde bedi dwuma ɔkwan biara so.
I know that’s true in most situations.	Minim sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware wɔ tebea dodow no ara mu.
Assume it isn’t.	Fa no sɛ ɛnte saa.
Here is the letter.	Krataa no ni.
Make sure no one enters this room.	Hwɛ sɛ obiara nkɔ dan yi mu.
Comfortable shoes and clothes and never, ever, heels.	Mpaboa ne ntade a ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛnyɛ da, da, nan ase.
Give him whatever he wants.	Ma no nea ɔpɛ biara.
He should have, and he should.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
We ran down the road.	Yɛde mmirika faa ɔkwan no so.
He put his hand on me.	Ɔde ne nsa too me so.
You are both right.	Mo baanu nyinaa asɛm no yɛ nokware.
I will use whatever means necessary.	Mede ɔkwan biara a ɛho hia bedi dwuma.
That’s what they use now.	Ɛno ne nea wɔde di dwuma mprempren.
Look at our schools, look at our police.	Hwɛ yɛn sukuu ahorow, hwɛ yɛn polisifo.
But this is not a book.	Nanso eyi nyɛ nhoma.
Or unless we have someone else.	Anaasɛ gye sɛ yɛwɔ obi foforo.
Should be fun!.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye!.
You are absolutely right about everything.	Woayɛ no yiye koraa wɔ biribiara ho.
When did people get that.	Bere bɛn na nkurɔfo nyaa saa.
My father is a father.	Me papa yɛ papa.
The haunting music hits.	Nnwom a ɛyɛ hu no bɔ mu.
There was just enough room for them.	Ná baabi a ɛdɔɔso ara kwa wɔ hɔ ma wɔn.
I absolutely love this product.	M’ani gye saa ade yi ho koraa.
I’m not sure.	Me ankasa.
I will treat you like a man.	Me ne wo bedi sɛ ɔbarima.
That’s the most important meeting you have in any given day.	Ɛno ne nhyiam a ɛho hia sen biara a wowɔ wɔ da biara mu.
Clothes did make the man.	Ntade yɛɛ ɔbarima no ampa.
You do the same thing.	Woyɛ saa ara.
So, that’s hers.	Enti, ɛno ne ne de.
You have such beautiful clothes.	Wowɔ ntade a ɛyɛ fɛ saa.
One foot is enough.	Nan biako na ɛdɔɔso.
What kind of work do you think he does?	Adwuma bɛn na wususuw sɛ ɔyɛ?
You have three days to get there.	Wowɔ nnansa a wode bɛkɔ hɔ.
There is nothing else to do here.	Biribiara nni hɔ bio a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wɔ ha.
So they don’t really need to use a story.	Enti enhia ankasa sɛ wɔde asɛm bi bedi dwuma.
Enough time has passed to argue.	Bere a ɛdɔɔso atwam a wɔde begye akyinnye.
Put the phone away!	Fa telefon no to nkyɛn!
Maybe he doesn’t know.	Ebia onnim.
The face of the man.	Onipa anim.
And he doesn’t paint much either.	Na ɔnyɛ mfonini pii nso.
That nothing is wrong.	Sɛ biribiara nyɛ bɔne.
But in my opinion, not at all.	Nanso wɔ m’adwene mu no, ɛnyɛ saa koraa.
Is that a surprise?	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa?
We just have to do our jobs.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ yɛn nnwuma ara kwa.
I wanted to know more.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu pii.
Most of us are not.	Yɛn mu dodow no ara nte saa.
To be with him.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɔne no bɛyɛ.
Tell me about that.	Ka saa asɛm no kyerɛ me.
I think you know that.	Misusuw sɛ wunim saa.
I believe the time is now.	Migye di sɛ bere no yɛ mprempren.
He knew so many people.	Ná onim nnipa pii saa.
He kept coming back here too.	Ɔno nso kɔɔ so san baa ha.
You don’t know what you’re doing or what you’re supposed to be doing.	Wunnim nea woreyɛ anaa nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
He had every right to say that, you know.	Na ɔwɔ hokwan a edi mũ sɛ ɔka saa, wunim.
He tilted his head to the side.	Ɔde ne ti too nkyɛn.
The illustrations are simple and beautiful.	Mfonini ahorow no yɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ fɛ.
It’s just a wonderful, wonderful story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa, ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
Or at least he thought so.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, na osusuw sɛ ɛte saa.
It is the very nature of our mind.	Ɛyɛ yɛn adwene no su ankasa.
We’re really glad you’re here.	Yɛn ani agye ankasa sɛ wowɔ ha.
Perform configuration tests.	Yɛ nhyehyɛe ho sɔhwɛ ahorow.
It’s really really good.	Ɛyɛ papa ankasa ankasa.
And that was for the best.	Na ɛno yɛ nea eye sen biara.
He worries about it.	Ɔhaw ne ho wɔ ho.
I have them now.	Mewɔ wɔn mprempren.
And that went on for too long.	Na ɛno kɔɔ so bere tenten dodo.
Anyone can beat anyone.	Obiara betumi adi obiara so nkonim.
All of this is unnecessary.	Eyi nyinaa ho nhia.
And yet, it does, too.	Na nanso, ɛyɛ saa, nso.
I just heard some wonderful things about you.	Metee wo ho nsɛm bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
There is some truth in these words.	Nokware bi wɔ nsɛm yi mu.
The winter cold was severe.	Ná awɔw bere mu awɔw no mu yɛ den.
Look at what you say.	Hwɛ nea woka.
Those pictures are old.	Saa mfonini ahorow no yɛ dedaw.
They haven’t been interested in a long time.	Wɔn ani nnye ho bere tenten ni.
That is not possible.	Ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
The following night.	Anadwo a edi hɔ no.
I could hardly believe my eyes.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nnye m’ani nni.
It will be easier this way.	Ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw wɔ saa kwan yi so.
Now the food is served.	Seesei wɔde aduan no ma.
The music is very loud.	Nnwom no yɛ den yiye.
They must have enjoyed the wet summer.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na wɔn ani gyee awɔw bere a na nsu wom no ho.
It’s a good city.	Ɛyɛ kurow pa.
Anything will do, really.	Biribiara bɛyɛ, ampa.
The real point is that it didn’t matter.	Asɛm no ankasa ne sɛ na ɛnyɛ hwee.
There are a few things you need to know.	Nneɛma kakraa bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
He only wanted me.	Ná ɔpɛ me nkutoo.
Books tell stories.	Nhoma ahorow ka nsɛm.
The story is full of interesting details.	Nsɛm a ɛyɛ anigye ahyɛ asɛm no mu ma.
I should have been happy.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani gye.
He had no money for such expensive courses.	Ná onni sika a ɔde bɛyɛ adesua ahorow a ne bo yɛ den saa.
That is absolutely true.	Ɛno yɛ nokware ankasa.
I'm going to tell them.	Me deɛ, mɛka akyerɛ wɔn.
Do not argue from that framework.	Mfi saa nhyehyɛe no mu nnye akyinnye.
I was working on it well.	Ná mereyɛ ho adwuma yiye.
We will become better people.	Yɛbɛyɛ nnipa pa.
You go like that and you go.	Wo kɔ saa na wo kɔ.
But his agenda was old-fashioned, ahead of the reputation agenda.	Nanso na ne nhyehyɛe no yɛ dedaw, na na ɛwɔ din pa nhyehyɛe no anim.
But that is part of the present case.	Nanso ɛno ka mprempren asɛm no ho.
The best part is that anyone can do this.	Nea eye sen biara ne sɛ obiara betumi ayɛ eyi.
That is the a.	Ɛno ne a.
I’d really appreciate that.	M’ani begye saa asɛm no ho ankasa.
However, it all went very well.	Nanso, ne nyinaa kɔɔ so yiye paa.
They are not as important as they used to be.	Wɔn ho nhia te sɛ kan no.
I just think of you as.	Misusuw wo ho ara kwa sɛ.
He filled it with water.	Ɔde nsu hyɛɛ mu ma.
He has a lot to say.	Ɔwɔ nsɛm pii ka.
I see things as they are.	Mihu nneɛma sɛnea ɛte.
Maybe they were, a little.	Ebia na wɔyɛ, kakra.
Everyone is very sorry for what happened.	Obiara di yaw paa wɔ nea esii no ho.
I really enjoyed this one.	M’ani gyee eyi ho yiye.
That's great, thank you.	Ɛno yɛ kɛse, meda wo ase.
I want to know what he knows.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea onim.
But my mother did.	Nanso me maame yɛɛ saa.
You’ve done it right.	Woayɛ no yiye.
I forged that letter.	Meyɛɛ saa krataa no atoro.
Over the next few days.	Wɔ nna kakraa a edi hɔ no mu.
But he wanted something.	Nanso na ɔpɛ biribi.
Water.	Nsu.
That could have happened earlier.	Anka ɛno betumi aba kan.
This film has problems.	Saa sini yi wɔ ɔhaw ahorow.
However, what happened last week is not the way.	Nanso, nea esii dapɛn a etwaam no nyɛ ɔkwan no.
This is a good thing.	Eyi yɛ ade pa.
I'm worried about you.	Wo ho asɛm haw me.
I don’t want to know.	Mempɛ sɛ mihu.
Winter would be here soon.	Ná awɔw bere bɛba ha nnansa yi ara.
I expect two more.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ abien foforo bɛka ho.
This game was a lot of fun.	Ná saa agoru yi yɛ anigye kɛse.
And it’s still fun.	Na ɛda so ara yɛ anigye.
Just good stuff.	Nneɛma pa ara kwa.
Their food is not good.	Wɔn aduan nyɛ papa.
Very much fun he knew it would be.	Anigye kɛse paa a na onim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ.
More on this in the next article.	Eyi ho nsɛm pii wɔ asɛm a edi hɔ no mu.
He didn’t have it.	Ná onni no.
But that wasn’t entirely true.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ nokware koraa.
He was in trouble.	Na ɔwɔ ɔhaw mu.
All in one days work.	Ne nyinaa wɔ nna biako mu yɛ adwuma.
This approach surprised me.	Saa kwan yi maa me ho dwiriw me.
Maybe, if things work out.	Ebia, sɛ nneɛma kɔ yiye a.
But in any case.	Nanso ɔkwan biara so.
She feels strongly about animal rights.	Ɔte nka kɛse wɔ mmoa hokwan ahorow ho.
It’s too soon to tell.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo sɛ wobɛka.
It’s so good, so good.	Ɛyɛ papa saa, papa saa.
However, he did not want this.	Nanso, na ɔmpɛ eyi.
I want everything you have.	Mepɛ biribiara a wowɔ.
The story comes to an end.	Asɛm no ba awiei.
His plan was interesting.	Ná ne nhyehyɛe no yɛ anigye.
The animals took up all the space.	Mmoa no faa baabi a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa.
Everything was wrong.	Ná biribiara yɛ bɔne.
Everyone was afraid of them.	Ná obiara suro wɔn.
Maybe his mother wanted him, after all.	Ebia na ne maame pɛ no, ne nyinaa akyi no.
My father is late.	Me papa aka akyi.
I believe it was the best he could have.	Migye di sɛ na ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara a obetumi anya.
Only the song.	Dwom no nkutoo.
He stroked the cat's soft fur.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ɔkraman no ho nhwi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no mu.
People like him on the street.	Nnipa ani gye ne ho wɔ abɔnten so.
You both go.	Mo baanu nyinaa kɔ.
This idea is not new.	Saa adwene yi nyɛ ade foforo.
That’s not what we have here.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea yɛwɔ wɔ ha.
You are beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ.
The hand touches you.	Nsa no ka wo.
Not for a moment, by any means.	Ɛnyɛ bere tiaa bi, ɔkwan biara so.
He just knew it would be a police car.	Ná onim ara kwa sɛ ɛbɛyɛ polisifo kar.
It’s still there though.	Ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ nanso.
Take a very close look at that book.	Hwɛ saa nhoma no yiye paa.
It’s not good at all.	Ɛnyɛ papa koraa.
My mother was gone.	Ná me maame nni hɔ bio.
This caused him a lot of trouble.	Saa ade yi maa ɔhaw kɛse baa no so.
I'm happy for you.	M'ani agye ma wo.
What you say is not very interesting.	Nea woka no nyɛ anigye kɛse.
And, you know, she’s a mom.	Na, wunim, ɔyɛ maame.
This is a wonderful idea.	Eyi yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Not to use it, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ yɛde bedi dwuma, ɔkwan biara so.
She had been beautiful once.	Ná wayɛ fɛ bere bi.
I don’t really know.	Minnim ankasa.
The ordeal lasted a month.	Ɔhaw no dii ɔsram biako.
Everything in this room is wet.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ dan yi mu no yɛ nsu.
It may be great.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
Maybe it will be you too.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ wo nso.
As fast as you can kids.	Ntɛmntɛm sɛnea wubetumi mmofra.
Everyone was stunned.	Ná obiara ho dwiriw no.
I immediately feel innocent.	Ntɛm ara na mete nka sɛ me ho nni asɛm.
But at the same time, it was good.	Nanso saa bere no ara, na eye.
Should be a lot of fun.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye pii.
Whether it is good or bad.	Sɛ́ ɛyɛ papa anaa bɔne.
I know he would say the same	Minim sɛ ɔno nso bɛka saa
I was no longer human	Ná menyɛ onipa bio
And discuss your problems with them.	Na wo ne wɔn nsusuw wo haw ahorow ho.
Usually you don’t have to do anything.	Mpɛn pii no enhia sɛ woyɛ biribiara.
He glanced away quickly.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ baabi foforo ntɛmntɛm.
I knew the face too well	Ná minim anim no yiye dodo
Or the number of them.	Anaasɛ wɔn dodow.
Over and over, over and over again.	Mpɛn pii, mpɛn pii.
Something you shouldn’t forget for a long time	Ade a ɛnsɛ sɛ wo werɛ mfi bere tenten
He can get into anything and everything in our house.	Obetumi akɔ biribiara ne biribiara a ɛwɔ yɛn fie mu.
I think we were all surprised	Misusuw sɛ na yɛn nyinaa ho dwiriw yɛn
That wants to be him.	Ɛno pɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ɔno.
I would probably use more	Ebia na mede pii bedi dwuma
I need to talk to you	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa
Anyway, get out if you want.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, sɛ wopɛ a, fi adi.
It almost looks like stuffing.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛte sɛ nea wɔde nneɛma ahyɛ mu.
He was in a terrible way.	Ná ɔwɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu so.
That is a very smart thing to do.	Ɛno yɛ ade a nyansa wom yiye a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I kicked him through	Mede me nan bɔɔ ne ho de no faa mu
We need to hurry now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ntɛm mprempren.
You know how he works.	Wunim sɛnea ɔyɛ adwuma.
Or at least they were anyway.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, na wɔyɛ saa ɔkwan biara so.
Say whatever you want to whomever you want.	Ka nea wopɛ biara kyerɛ obiara a wopɛ.
I took you to bed after all	Mede wo kɔɔ mpa so wɔ ne nyinaa akyi
No problem, really.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ, ampa.
Everything but nothing, dramatically.	Biribiara gye sɛ biribiara nni hɔ, wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
That’s my favorite thing about her.	Ɛno ne ade a m’ani gye ho paa wɔ ne ho.
Few people do this.	Nnipa kakraa bi na wɔyɛ eyi.
Maybe it was just the cold.	Ebia na ɛyɛ awɔw no ara kwa.
I just couldn’t understand it	Na mintumi nte ase kɛkɛ
It was too soon in a way.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
I can do that now.	Metumi ayɛ saa mprempren.
Look, that’s not the point.	Hwɛ, ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
They gave it a lot of attention	Wɔde adwene sii so kɛse
Therefore, .	Enti, .
I must have friends somewhere out there	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mewɔ nnamfo wɔ baabi wɔ abɔnten
I can't figure out why	Mintumi nhu nea enti a ɛte saa
I just want to keep doing that	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ saa ara kɛkɛ
I am willing to do it	Mewɔ ɔpɛ sɛ mɛyɛ
I have to take care of myself .	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ me ho .
However, this long days seemed impossible.	Nanso, na ɛte sɛ nea eyi a wɔde nna tenten ayɛ no ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Do something else.	Yɛ biribi foforo.
I knew everything about him	Ná minim ne ho biribiara
Mother was a strong person.	Na Maame ne obi a ne ho yɛ den.
I knew he was real	Ná minim sɛ ɔyɛ onipa ankasa
A moment of convenience	Bere tiaa bi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw
We can accomplish this from a picture.	Yebetumi abam eyi afi mfonini.
What people do and why they do it.	Nea nkurɔfo yɛ ne nea enti a wɔyɛ.
This is pretty much the best case scenario.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ eyi ne asɛm a eye sen biara.
I couldn’t keep going.	Na mintumi nkɔ so.
I had to feel something	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mete biribi nka
I'm still working on that.	Meda so ara reyɛ saa adwuma no ho adwuma.
I lie down and look under the car	Meda fam hwɛ kar no ase
You know where it is.	Wunim baabi a ɛwɔ.
I still can't figure out what they are	Meda so ara ntumi nhu nea wɔyɛ
I thought about that	Misusuw saa asɛm no ho
It’s the truth.	Ɛyɛ nokware no.
Not as it is now.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛte mprempren no.
I couldn't understand why he was upset.	Ná mintumi nte nea enti a ɔhaw no no ase.
That was about .	Ná ɛno yɛ bɛyɛ .
I need to know what is going on here	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha
He did, and how.	Ɔyɛɛ saa, na ɔkwan bɛn so.
Over and over and over again.	Mpɛn pii ne mpɛn pii.
I still find the details amazing	Meda so ara hu sɛ nsɛm no mu nsɛm no yɛ nwonwa
It was like something out of a book.	Ná ɛte sɛ biribi a ɛwɔ nhoma bi mu.
I could do it.	Ná metumi ayɛ.
However, I want to know	Nanso, mepɛ sɛ mihu
I am very worried about him	Ne ho asɛm haw me paa
Don’t doubt me on this one.	Mma me nnye me ho kyim wɔ eyi ho.
I prefer not to know.	Mepɛ sɛ minnim.
There just isn’t much.	Nneɛma pii nni hɔ ara kwa.
A little time to do what he needs to do	Bere kakra a ɔde bɛyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ
It’s not pretty.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
But if it isn’t.	Nanso sɛ ɛnte saa a.
And he wanted more.	Na na ɔpɛ pii nso.
However, there is something in it.	Nanso, biribi wɔ mu.
There were a lot of people in the game.	Ná nnipa pii wɔ agoru no mu.
The main house followed later	Ofie no fã kɛse no dii akyi akyiri yi
He was doing very well in school.	Ná ɔreyɛ yiye kɛse wɔ sukuu mu.
I already felt uncomfortable enough	Ná mete nka sɛ me ho nyɛ me den sɛnea ɛsɛ dedaw
Use it as you wish.	Fa di dwuma sɛnea wopɛ.
He was alone with his mother afterwards.	Ɔno ne ne maame nkutoo wɔ ɛno akyi.
I just want to spend the day with you	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo di da no ara kwa
I love the dress on you	M’ani gye atade a ɛwɔ wo so no ho
Where a dog barks.	Baabi a ɔkraman bi bɔ.
One of you.	Wo mu biako.
We are good then.	Yɛyɛ papa saa bere no.
Or he joined them.	Anaasɛ ɔde ne ho bɔɔ wɔn.
A little fun also goes a long way	Anigye kakra nso kɔ akyiri
I can’t even go to the door with him.	Mintumi ne no nkɔ ɔpon no ano mpo.
Out of town now.	Kurow no akyi mprempren.
There is no perfect way.	Ɔkwan a edi mũ biara nni hɔ.
I rub my hands together to relieve myself	Mede me nsa bɔ me ho sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a me ho bɛtɔ me
He even knew the man's name.	Ná onim ɔbarima no din mpo.
Sin will be great.	Bɔne bɛyɛ kɛse.
I wanted to see what people would do tomorrow.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu nea nkurɔfo bɛyɛ ɔkyena.
It was everyone's right.	Na ɛyɛ onipa biara hokwan.
We all know who you introduce yourself to.	Yɛn nyinaa nim onii a wode wo ho kyerɛ no.
I saw some things on him	Mihuu nneɛma bi wɔ ne so
They had both seen him.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa ahu no.
I need to know something	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu biribi
That’s always been the case.	Saa na ɛte bere nyinaa.
Look at your picture.	Hwɛ wo mfonini no.
I just want it on paper.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛwɔ krataa so kɛkɛ.
Everyone will let you go now.	Obiara bɛma wo kwan seesei.
When you’re warm, you make everything easier.	Sɛ wo ho yɛ wo hyew a, wo ma biribiara yɛ mmerɛw.
He’s a city dog.	Ɔyɛ kurow mu kraman.
And the people, too.	Na nkurɔfo no nso.
But there is a way.	Nanso ɔkwan bi wɔ hɔ.
Your work is important to me	Mo adwuma no ho hia me
I just want to see them.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wɔn ara kwa.
Review.	Hwɛ mu.
I just wanted to know that was all	Na mepɛ sɛ mihu ara kwa sɛ ɛno ara ne no
He was very understanding	Ná ɔte ase paa
I know your schedule is busy	Minim sɛ wo nhyehyɛe no yɛ nea adagyew nnim
I have it right here in my book	Mewɔ bi wɔ ha yi ara wɔ me nhoma no mu
I think so too.	Me nso misusuw saa.
Apologize first.	Di kan pa kyɛw.
I just took it further.	Mede kɔɔ akyiri ara kwa.
I want to talk about you	Mepɛ sɛ meka wo ho asɛm
So much for sex.	Enti pii ma nna mu.
If you do, the door is there.	Sɛ woyɛ saa a, ɔpon no wɔ hɔ.
The man on the road.	Ɔbarima a ɔwɔ kwan so no.
I thought it would be easy	Misusuwii sɛ ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw
At the same time.	Bere koro no ara mu.
Unless, you have children.	Gye sɛ, wowɔ mma.
However, this is a mistake.	Nanso, eyi yɛ mfomso.
I hope you know that	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wunim saa
They all love you.	Wɔn nyinaa pɛ wo.
It’s going to be a great night.	Ɛbɛyɛ anadwo kɛse.
Many of us were like that	Ná yɛn mu pii te saa
That has not been the case last year.	Ɛnyɛ saa na afe a etwaam no ayɛ.
I don’t know that right now.	Minnim saa mprempren.
I would do anything for you.	Anka mɛyɛ biribiara ama wo.
I was a kid with the first two	Ná me ne baanu a edi kan no yɛ abofra
You know you’re excited.	Wunim sɛ w’ani agye.
It’s not that bad.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne saa.
He had started with his hands.	Ná ɔde ne nsa afi ase.
And, look at me.	Na, hwɛ me.
He needs to be better than he’s ever been.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ papa sen sɛnea na wayɛ pɛn.
I really didn’t want to see him	Ankasa na mempɛ sɛ mihu no
It was no longer his dog.	Ná ɛnyɛ ne kraman bio.
That’s the point, anyway.	Ɛno ne asɛm no, ɔkwan biara so.
The house is getting warmer.	Ofie no mu reyɛ hyew.
But here you are.	Nanso wo ni.
I didn’t know my father	Ná minnim me papa
My plan is not much better.	Me nhyehyɛe no nyɛ papa pii.
And their team is going to do this the right way.	Na wɔn kuw no rekɔ so ayɛ eyi wɔ ɔkwan pa so.
I'm so sorry, it's not really true	Mepa wo kyɛw paa, ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa
Look, she’s beautiful.	Hwɛ, ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I think he must be pretty good.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔyɛ papa yiye.
I don’t want to bother him	Mempɛ sɛ ɔhaw no
Much of this is due to.	Eyi mu dodow no ara fi.
The car wasn't that bad.	Ná kar no nyɛ bɔne saa.
At least not immediately.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ ntɛm ara.
Go a step further.	Kɔ akyiri bio.
I saw the police there	Mihuu polisifo wɔ hɔ
Maybe it would be nice if you could.	Ebia sɛ wubetumi a, ɛbɛyɛ papa.
I think, you know, there are reasons for that	Misusuw sɛ, wunim, nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa
Obviously, planning is important	Ɛda adi sɛ nhyehyɛe ho hia
I know that wasn’t what you meant	Minim sɛ na ɛnyɛ nea wopɛ sɛ woka
Not that it’s a bad thing.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ade bɔne.
And that’s not good either.	Na ɛno nso nyɛ papa.
I didn’t want to know more	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu pii
It doesn’t really matter.	Ɛnyɛ hwee ankasa.
I didn't want to watch this	Ná mempɛ sɛ mehwɛ eyi
Definitely for me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ ma me.
It seems like a lifetime.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nkwa nna nyinaa.
Anyway, no one was home now.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na obiara nni fie mprempren.
I work with them every day	Me ne wɔn yɛ adwuma da biara da
He just seemed to know he had done his part.	Ɛte sɛ nea na onim ara kwa sɛ wayɛ ne fam de.
But he was more so.	Nanso na ɔyɛ saa kɛse.
That’s a plus.	Ɛno yɛ ade a wɔde ka ho.
The way they do it.	Sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
It was such a pleasure	Ná ɛyɛ anigye a ɛte saa
However, I still couldn’t find the gun	Nanso, na meda so ara ntumi nhu tuo no
Which is the thing he would do.	Nea ɛyɛ ade a anka ɔbɛyɛ.
I did have a wonderful time, thank you	Me nyaa bere a ɛyɛ anigye ampa, meda wo ase
I will definitely do it	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mɛyɛ no
To me music is music.	Me fam no nnwom yɛ nnwom.
I thought there was no one left	Misusuwii sɛ obiara nni hɔ bio
It was a bad ending for me.	Ná ɛyɛ awiei bɔne ma me.
I didn’t have to tell anyone	Na enhia sɛ meka kyerɛ obiara
Maybe not friends.	Ebia ɛnyɛ nnamfo.
Tell me what you know.	Ka nea wunim kyerɛ me.
Or he used to be.	Anaasɛ kan no na ɔte saa.
We closed our eyes.	Yɛde yɛn ani bɔɔ mu.
I’ve always loved working nights	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ adwuma anadwo bere nyinaa
They told me that you might be able to help	Wɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ ebia wubetumi aboa
However, I really wanted him to.	Nanso, na mepɛ ankasa sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
And it didn’t matter.	Na ɛnyɛ hwee.
It’s absolutely beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ koraa.
All three would have been ideal.	Anka abiɛsa no nyinaa bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
You can do that again.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa bio.
He’s just a great kid.	Ɔyɛ abofra kɛse bi kɛkɛ.
I concluded that the reason was this	Mede baa awiei sɛ nea enti a ɛte saa ne eyi
And it will be so.	Na ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I wonder where we are	Misusuw baabi a yɛwɔ ho
Recently, there has been a lot of news about him.	Nnansa yi, nsɛm pii aba ne ho.
I took his hand in mine	Mede ne nsa hyɛɛ me nsa mu
I was a good guy.	Ná meyɛ ɔbarima pa.
He just loved that.	Ná n’ani gye saa asɛm no ho ara kwa.
And these bed sheets.	Na saa mpa so ntade yi nso.
It’s really hard a lot.	Ɛyɛ den ankasa pii.
I think the same things he told you	Misusuw sɛ nneɛma koro no ara a ɔka kyerɛɛ wo no
I have planned for that	Mayɛ nhyehyɛe ama ɛno
Which should be interesting.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
He got along well with them.	Na ɔne wɔn bɔ yiye.
It must be done properly.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no yiye.
I could use days	Ná metumi de nna pii adi dwuma
I used it.	Mede dii dwuma.
It’s a month late.	Ɛyɛ ɔsram biako aka akyi.
You are beautiful in it.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ wɔ mu.
Or at least not until he does some of it.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ kosi sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ne bi.
I saw where this was	Mihuu baabi a eyi wɔ
I loved just hanging out with him	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ me ne no bɛbɔ kɛkɛ
More about us than about them.	Yɛn ho nsɛm pii sen wɔn.
I never want to know	Mempɛ sɛ mihu da
Many were already gone.	Ná pii afi hɔ dedaw.
If you do, I’d appreciate it.	Sɛ woyɛ saa a, m’ani begye ho.
I still don't really.	Meda so ara nyɛ saa ankasa.
But people don’t seem to.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea nkurɔfo nyɛ saa.
I think we’re on the right track now	Misusuw sɛ yɛwɔ ɔkwan pa so mprempren
So they set foot on the road.	Enti wɔde wɔn nan sii kwan so.
But this is an old book.	Nanso eyi yɛ nhoma dedaw.
I am really looking forward to this	Mehwɛ eyi kwan ankasa
I know that will take time	Minim sɛ ɛno begye bere
The street was very soft.	Ná abɔnten no yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
And that was just a day later.	Na ɛno yɛ da koro pɛ akyi.
It’s hard for me, but it’s significant.	Ɛyɛ den ma me, nanso ɛyɛ nea ɛho hia.
I didn’t really care	Ná ɛnyɛ me asɛm ankasa
I didn't know what to do now	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ mprempren
He shrugged the idea off.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ adwene no fii hɔ.
I just wish it hadn’t been so long	Me yam a anka ɛnyɛ bere tenten saa ara kwa
I also saw something else	Mihuu biribi foforo nso
All in one shot.	Ne nyinaa wɔ tuo biako mu.
I think it was a man	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ ɔbarima
I can be good for him now.	Metumi ayɛ papa ama no mprempren.
I don’t like it now	M’ani nnye ho mprempren
Or he was, anyway.	Anaasɛ na ɔyɛ, sɛnea ɛte biara.
Not for us, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn de, ɔkwan biara so.
I felt like a new person	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ onipa foforo
At least give it to him.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ma no.
I will renew it.	Me na mɛyɛ no foforo.
But the room was not so nice.	Nanso na dan no mu nyɛ fɛ saa.
Again, there were not many pictures.	Bio nso, na mfonini ahorow pii nni hɔ.
But he knew exactly why.	Nanso na onim nea enti ankasa.
It looks even more crowded than last time.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ma kɛse mpo sen bere a etwaam no.
I really like that guy	M’ani gye saa ɔbarima no ho ankasa
Take a look at it with your hands.	Fa wo nsa hwɛ.
I wish only the best for him as well	Mepɛ nea eye sen biara nkutoo ma ɔno nso
He had no self-control.	Ná onni ne ho so tumi.
Nothing else matters to me	Biribiara foforo biara mfa me ho
You want what it looks like.	Wopɛ nea ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa no.
And you just do it.	Na woyɛ ara kwa.
I felt at home there	Metee nka wɔ hɔ te sɛ nea mewɔ fie
It’s just what it is.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛte ara kwa.
He had a lot to think about.	Ná ɔwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ osusuw ho.
The work of his hands.	Adwuma a ne nsa yɛ.
There was a bed off the front room	Ná mpa bi fi anim dan no mu
I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.	Minsusuw sɛ mfomso biara wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
There was so much to do.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
He had legs.	Ná ɔwɔ nan.
Their stay was brief.	Wɔn tra no yɛɛ bere tiaa bi.
It’s his opinion.	Ɛyɛ n’adwene.
The danger was great.	Ná asiane no yɛ kɛse.
But you really have to come with us.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne yɛn ba ankasa.
They work in one’s mind.	Wɔyɛ adwuma wɔ obi adwene mu.
I know he wasn’t.	Minim sɛ na ɔnyɛ saa.
It’s what we do.	Ɛyɛ nea yɛyɛ.
I was being a child	Ná mereyɛ abofra
Are they the same thing.	So wɔyɛ ade koro no ara.
It doesn’t matter at all.	Ɛnyɛ hwee koraa.
It is very important to remember.	Ɛho hia paa sɛ wokae.
In recent years.	Wɔ nnansa yi mfe mu.
This is quite a lot.	Eyi yɛ pii koraa.
The same is true of language.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ kasa ho.
As he would do it.	Sɛnea na ɔbɛyɛ no.
But something is going wrong.	Nanso biribi rekɔ so bɔne.
I know mine is pretty simple	Minim sɛ me de no yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye
Our time has come.	Yɛn bere adu.
It’s not really complicated.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den ankasa.
If you know of one, please tell me.	Sɛ wunim biako a, mesrɛ wo ka kyerɛ me.
I would have done that.	Anka mɛyɛ saa.
Tomorrow would be perfect.	Ná ɔkyena bɛyɛ nea edi mũ.
But it never works.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma da.
Or not even that.	Anaasɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno mpo.
I have to do things right	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nneɛma yiye
He has a background.	Ɔwɔ akyi.
I was very fond of wine	Ná m’ani gye nsa ho kɛse
I didn't know what he was now	Ná minnim nea ɔyɛ mprempren
I had to go further	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ akyiri
And it was difficult.	Na na ɛyɛ den.
In the same thing.	Wɔ ade koro no ara mu.
I know nothing in this situation.	Minnim hwee wɔ tebea yi mu.
He knew exactly what he had to do.	Ná onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no yiye.
I hadn’t really thought about it at all	Ná minsusuw ho koraa ankasa
I wonder what they like best.	Misusuw nea wɔn ani gye ho sen biara ho.
I'm really sorry about that	Mepa wo kyɛw ankasa wɔ saa asɛm no ho
It was his first book	Ná ɛyɛ ne nhoma a edi kan
They were poorly sized.	Ná wɔn kɛse nyɛ papa.
In the system, however, that is not the case.	Nanso, wɔ nhyehyɛe no mu no, ɛnyɛ saa.
I want you to bring them all	Mepɛ sɛ wode wɔn nyinaa ba
Already, things look good.	Dedaw no, nneɛma hwɛ yiye.
I want to see if it works	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma anaa
But I have to, or he’ll be late for work	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa, anyɛ saa a ɔbɛka akyi wɔ adwuma mu
I didn’t think you could get into trouble that easily	Na minsusuw sɛ wubetumi akɔ ɔhaw mu ntɛmntɛm saa
I really hope he can help me	Mewɔ anidaso ankasa sɛ obetumi aboa me
I saw something else that was amazing	Mihuu ade foforo a ɛyɛ nwonwa
Looking at things.	Hwɛ a wode nneɛma hwɛ no.
We are free of ourselves.	Yɛde yɛn ho.
He had nowhere else to go.	Ná onni baabi foforo biara a ɔbɛkɔ.
I must have been sore or something	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na me ho ayɛ me yaw anaa biribi a ɛte saa
Too busy for his problems.	Adagyew dodo ma ne haw ahorow.
There is nothing more terrifying.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ hu sen saa.
By the way.	Kwan ho.
It’s the best!.	Ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara!.
He is the only one.	Ɔno nkutoo ne obi.
Let me think about it.	Ma minsusuw ho.
I feel like these things are not that important	Mete nka sɛ saa nneɛma yi ho nhia saa
I need to understand what this means	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete nea eyi kyerɛ ase
That doesn’t matter.	Ɛno mfa ho.
You seem to know what to do immediately.	Ɛte sɛ nea wunim nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ntɛm ara.
And therefore most importantly.	Na ɛno nti nea ɛho hia sen biara.
I, too, love books.	Me nso, m’ani gye nhoma ho.
I think we should all be happy	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa ani gye
I didn’t know all that about him	Ná minnim ne ho saa nsɛm no nyinaa
I do it hard.	Meyɛ no denneennen.
This is a good thing for me.	Eyi yɛ ade pa ma me.
This is the only time he is mentioned.	Eyi nkutoo ne bere a wɔka ne ho asɛm.
I’m almost as excited as you are	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ m’ani agye te sɛ mo ara
I think it works.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
It’s the truth.	Ɛyɛ nokware no.
It just seems like something so real.	Ɛte sɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nokware saa ara kwa.
I didn’t have it at the time	Na minni saa bere no
I couldn’t drive.	Ná mintumi nka kar.
I don't even think he knew that.	Minsusuw mpo sɛ na onim saa asɛm no.
My kind, or his kind.	Me su, anaa ne su.
And don’t get too carried away with music.	Na nkɔ so nkɔ so wɔ nnwom mu dodo.
He has enough to deal with.	Ɔwɔ nea ɛdɔɔso a ɛsɛ sɛ odi ho dwuma.
I knew then what he was doing	Saa bere no na minim nea ɔreyɛ
I was young, but it was easy	Ná meyɛ abofra, nanso na ɛnyɛ den
It’s so easy that even a child can use it, and they do.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ abofra mpo betumi de adi dwuma, na wɔyɛ saa.
Nor did he have anywhere else in the room.	Saa ara nso na na onni baabi foforo biara wɔ dan no mu.
They say it and everything.	Wɔka no ne biribiara.
I can’t cry about it	Mintumi nsu wɔ ho
I hope he does it soon	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔbɛyɛ no ntɛm
I wanted to apologize	Ná mepɛ sɛ mepa kyɛw
His condition was no worse.	Ná ne tebea nyɛ bɔne sen kan no.
And apparently neither did his father.	Na ɛda adi sɛ ne papa nso anyɛ saa.
Stay in the house.	Tra fie hɔ.
I am not entirely irrelevant at all	Menyɛ nea ɛho nhia koraa koraa
We simply provide our services.	Yɛde yɛn nnwuma no ma kɛkɛ.
I don't have any.	Minni bi.
These two had that.	Ná saa baanu yi wɔ saa.
Any help would be amazing.	Mmoa biara bɛyɛ nwonwa.
Maybe I 'a' know.	Ebia me 'a' nim.
I look forward to working with you as well	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ me ne mo nso bɛyɛ adwuma
I have made quite a few of these dresses this summer	Mayɛ saa ntade yi mu kakraa bi wɔ awɔw bere yi mu
I don’t think he is.	Minsusuw sɛ ɔte saa.
But the user.	Nanso nea ɔde di dwuma no.
I wanted you to know what was going on	Ná mepɛ sɛ wuhu nea ɛrekɔ so
The same thing is happening today.	Saa ara na ɛrekɔ so nnɛ.
But it’s good.	Nanso ɛyɛ papa.
However, I’m interested.	Nanso, m’ani gye ho.
That had to be the case here.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa wɔ ha.
He has a lot of time for her, these days.	Ɔwɔ bere pii ma no, nnansa yi.
The situation is never about us alone.	Tebea no mfa yɛn nkutoo ho da.
That has to happen.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ba.
I shouldn’t say it’s home	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meka sɛ ɛyɛ ofie
Everyone on the inside knows it, everyone on the outside knows it.	Obiara a ɔwɔ mu nim, obiara a ɔwɔ abɔnten nim.
I think he is doing well though	Misusuw sɛ ɔreyɛ yiye nanso
There was just something in my eyes, that’s all	Na biribi wɔ m’ani so ara kwa, ɛno ara ne no
No one needs you here.	Obiara nhia wo wɔ ha.
There is never the perfect time.	Bere a ɛyɛ pɛ no nni hɔ da.
I’m absolutely thrilled with the results	M’ani agye nea afi mu aba no ho koraa
My mother did what she wanted.	Me maame yɛɛ nea ɔpɛ.
I’m the only one there.	Me nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
We just surrender.	Yɛde yɛn ho ma kɛkɛ.
That much was nothing new.	Ná saa dodow no ara nyɛ ade foforo.
I spent the whole day staring out the window	Ná mede da mũ no nyinaa hwɛ mfɛnsere mu
At least he never was.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na onni hɔ da.
It’s absolutely the same.	Ɛte saa ara koraa.
However, it is not necessary.	Nanso, ɛho nhia.
Give him time.	Ma no bere.
I really looked amazing	Ná me ho yɛ nwonwa ankasa
However, it is.	Nanso, ɛte saa.
And there was an interesting reason.	Na na biribi a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
Currently in the first year.	Mprempren wɔ afe a edi kan no mu.
I just didn’t care that everyone knew	Na m’ani nnye ho ara kwa sɛ obiara nim
Besides, it didn’t matter.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, na ɛho nhia biara.
I never know what he will do next	Minnim nea ɔbɛyɛ akyi da
However, that doesn’t mean anything.	Nanso, ɛno nkyerɛ hwee.
I definitely feel that way.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mete nka saa.
I really had nothing to do	Ná minni biribiara a mɛyɛ ankasa
I only want what is best for you	Nea eye ma wo nkutoo na mepɛ sɛ meyɛ
I took the opportunity to look at him	Mede hokwan no hwɛɛ no
At least that was the plan.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no.
This was just one case.	Ná eyi yɛ asɛm biako pɛ.
Most of the time, I still don’t.	Mpɛn pii no, meda so ara nyɛ saa.
I didn’t have the power he was	Na minni tumi a na ɔyɛ
It is important in some way.	Ɛho hia wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
But there are some flaws in this paper.	Nanso mfomso ahorow bi wɔ krataa yi mu.
Maybe for the girl it was.	Ebia wɔ abeawa no fam no, na ɛte saa.
I live here now.	Mete ha mprempren.
I hope people give us a chance	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ nkurɔfo bɛma yɛn hokwan
Perhaps you know that too.	Ebia wo nso wunim saa.
I am doing what he wants	Mereyɛ nea ɔpɛ
He hoped it would be the last	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nea etwa to
Only more awesome.	Nea ɛyɛ hu kɛse nkutoo.
Mine doesn’t have that.	Me de no nni saa.
This works now.	Eyi yɛ adwuma mprempren.
I hope someone is there	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ obi wɔ hɔ
You want money.	Wopɛ sika.
I still need to save someone	Ɛda so ara hia sɛ migye obi nkwa
This was obviously not the case.	Ɛda adi sɛ na eyi nte saa.
He was fiercely independent.	Ná ɔde ne ho denneennen.
And besides, he’s not .	Na ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɔnyɛ .
What exactly do you want.	Dɛn ankasa na wopɛ.
I can’t touch another leg	Mintumi nka nan foforo
It’s just a song.	Ɛyɛ dwom bi kɛkɛ.
Table making never seemed so successful	Ná ɛte sɛ nea pon a wɔyɛ no betumi ayɛ yiye saa da
I think you all are wonderful	Misusuw sɛ mo nyinaa yɛ nwonwa
This is not surprising.	Eyi nyɛ nwonwa.
She's really nice.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
People are afraid.	Nkurɔfo suro.
But nothing was going well.	Nanso na biribiara nkɔ yiye.
I also love working with my team	M’ani gye ho nso sɛ me ne me kuw no bɛyɛ adwuma
I think he did that.	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
You can see the results in the images below.	Wubetumi ahu nea afi mu aba wɔ mfonini ahorow a ɛwɔ ase ha no mu.
I know, it was amazing	Minim, na ɛyɛ nwonwa
Look, if you really want to do it you can.	Hwɛ, sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ ampa a wubetumi.
You know how you look.	Wunim sɛnea wo ho te.
He was very isolated.	Ɔde ne ho too nkyɛn paa.
Everyone had musical ideas.	Ná obiara wɔ nnwom ho adwene.
One day, go for a walk.	Da koro bi, kɔ nantew.
Play as you like.	Di agoru sɛnea w’ani gye ho.
They are bad people.	Wɔyɛ nnipa bɔne.
I might not know today	Ebia na minnim nnɛ
Think about this again	Susuw eyi ho bio
Or maybe it was the other way around.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɛyɛ ɔkwan foforo so.
No one needs to know.	Ɛho nhia sɛ obiara hu.
I think it’s my way	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ me kwan
I didn’t want the evening to end	Ná mempɛ sɛ anwummere no bɛba awiei
But it’s an idea.	Nanso ɛyɛ adwene.
It all went down well.	Ne nyinaa kɔɔ fam yiye.
I want you to see him	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu no
I was in bed all morning	Ná meda mpa so anɔpa mũ no nyinaa
Just do these things.	Yɛ saa nneɛma yi ara kwa.
This is a fascinating story.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye.
I totally disagree with him	Me ne no nyɛ adwene koraa
In this case.	Wɔ saa tebea yi mu no.
I feel happy, warm, passionate	Mete nka sɛ m’ani agye, me ho yɛ hyew, m’ani gye ho
This is not a walking party.	Eyi nyɛ apontow a wɔde nantew.
He doesn’t want to do this, either.	Ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ eyi, nso.
I didn’t always want children	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na na mepɛ mma
A girl leaned against the table.	Abeawa bi de ne ho too pon no so.
I want to know what happened in the last one.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea esii wɔ nea etwa to no mu.
I hope he's not home now	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ onni fie mprempren
I just feel alone	Mete nka ara kwa sɛ me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ
I can’t believe it’s been a month already	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ atwam ɔsram biako dedaw
I didn’t know what to say right away.	Ná minnim nea mɛka ntɛm ara.
I want it all, kids	Mepɛ ne nyinaa, mmofra
This is beautiful.	Eyi yɛ fɛ.
I can play a lot of music.	Metumi abɔ nnwom pii.
It wasn’t his problem, but he made me his problem	Na ɛnyɛ ne haw, nanso ɔde me yɛɛ ne haw
That’s after that.	Ɛno yɛ ɛno akyi.
I did that in a way.	Meyɛɛ saa wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
I think, this is the problem.	Misusuw sɛ, eyi ne ɔhaw no.
You know this now.	Wunim eyi mprempren.
That’s just one thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade biako pɛ.
Every day there was something.	Da biara na biribi wɔ hɔ.
And remember my words.	Na kae me nsɛm no.
I need to know more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu pii.
That makes things much easier.	Ɛno ma nneɛma yɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
She was his, to do as he pleased.	Ná ɔyɛ ne de, sɛ ɔbɛyɛ sɛnea n’ani gye ho.
Good communication is what matters	Nsɛm a wɔka kyerɛ pa ara ne nea ɛho hia
I am not the one you should talk to.	Ɛnyɛ me na ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no kasa.
I wanted to taste it	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka hwɛ
I couldn’t think about that anymore	Na mintumi nsusuw saa asɛm no ho bio
I don’t know for exactly how long	Minnim bere tenten ahe ankasa
I think people have always been human	Misusuw sɛ nkurɔfo ayɛ nnipa bere nyinaa
That’s not ideal.	Ɛno nyɛ ade a eye sen biara.
I think it was two years ago now.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ mfe abien a atwam ni mprempren.
This puzzled me, and I wondered what it all meant	Eyi maa me ho dwiriw me, na na misusuw nea ne nyinaa kyerɛ ho
I find that really cute and interesting too	Mihu sɛ ɛno nso yɛ fɛ ankasa na ɛyɛ anigye
Everyone is happy again.	Obiara ani gye bio.
It was just a wonderful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
A warm and wonderful movie	Sini a ɛyɛ hyew na ɛyɛ nwonwa
A year and a half or so ago.	Afe ne fã anaa nea ɛte saa a atwam ni.
I thought it was my mother	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ me maame
I can’t say anything	Mintumi nka hwee
It has a function.	Ɛwɔ adwuma bi.
I didn’t know what to say right away	Ná minnim nea mɛka ntɛm ara
That could only mean one thing.	Ná ɛno betumi akyerɛ ade biako pɛ.
Except for you and me.	Gye me ne wo nkutoo.
I want to be there for him when he hears the story	Mepɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ ma no bere a ɔte asɛm no
Only it somehow all went wrong.	Ɛno nkutoo na ɔkwan bi so no ne nyinaa ankɔ yiye.
I just couldn’t give him what he wanted	Na mintumi mfa nea ɔpɛ no mma no kɛkɛ
You have to give what you have.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode nea wowɔ no ma.
I love this part of you	M’ani gye wo fã yi ho
I can’t see anything.	Mintumi nhu ade.
He was an average boy.	Ná ɔyɛ abarimaa a ɔte nnipa mu.
I thought you might like them	Misusuwii sɛ ebia w’ani begye wɔn ho
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
I stare into his eyes	Mehwɛ n’ani so denneennen
I want to talk to both of you	Mepɛ sɛ me ne mo baanu nyinaa kasa
I need to tell you something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribi kyerɛ wo.
Remember, he does.	Kae sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
There is nothing to see there.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ahu wɔ hɔ.
These things don’t exist.	Saa nneɛma yi nni hɔ.
I told them that was all there was.	Meka kyerɛɛ wɔn sɛ ɛno ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ ara.
There was one man who thought.	Ná ɔbarima biako wɔ hɔ a osusuw ho.
And he might do badly on the test.	Na ebia na ɔbɛyɛ bɔne wɔ sɔhwɛ no mu.
So that’s two of the people.	Enti ɛno ne nnipa no mu baanu.
I had things to check	Ná mewɔ nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu
You know things.	Wunim nneɛma.
I shouldn’t have gone	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mekɔ
According to him.	Sɛnea ɔka no.
He really knows his stuff.	Onim ne nneɛma ankasa.
I can't use this phone	Mintumi mfa saa telefon yi so
And it might even be the truth.	Na ebia ɛbɛyɛ nokware no mpo.
I want to see my team again.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu me kuw no bio.
I didn’t like talking about it.	Ná m’ani nnye ho sɛ mɛka ho asɛm.
I doubt it, but maybe	Migye ho kyim, nanso ebia
I had to hang out with him	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no bɔ
Don’t hurt a little bit.	Mma wo yaw kakra.
I’m interested in money.	M’ani gye sika ho.
And that can’t be good enough.	Na ɛno ntumi nyɛ papa.
In the morning it wasn’t the same.	Anɔpa no na ɛnte saa ara.
It was so great for me.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse paa ma me.
I really wanted my plan to work	Ná mepɛ paa sɛ me nhyehyɛe no bɛyɛ adwuma
Surely there was another.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food.	Obiara ani gyee aduan no ho yiye.
Some years passed quickly.	Mfe bi kɔɔ so ntɛmntɛm.
However, I never do that.	Nanso, menyɛ saa da.
I’m interested in you	M’ani gye wo ho
However, some things remained the same.	Nanso, nneɛma bi kɔɔ so yɛɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
I just wanted to make sure you weren’t with him	Nea na mepɛ ara ne sɛ mehwɛ hu sɛ wo ne no nka ho
There was a lot of money involved.	Ná sika pii ka ho.
He told me not to do it again.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ menyɛ no bio.
This need not be the case.	Ɛho nhia sɛ eyi ba saa.
If you don’t want to be a part of it, fine.	Sɛ wompɛ sɛ woyɛ ne fã a, eye.
I really like it here	M’ani gye ho ankasa wɔ ha
I just wanted him to be free.	Nea na mepɛ ara ne sɛ ɔde ne ho.
I watch him all the time	Mehwɛ no bere nyinaa
But they have to do that.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I think he was on to something	Misusuw sɛ na ɔwɔ biribi so
I thought about the house	Misusuw ofie no ho
And people can’t give it to you.	Na nkurɔfo ntumi mfa mma wo.
However, I knew my father had to deal with this	Nanso, na minim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ me papa di eyi ho dwuma
I know what you are planning	Minim nea woreyɛ ho nhyehyɛe
Surely it would have been.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I have to give you this	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede eyi ma wo
I know him, and you know him.	Minim no, na wo nso wunim no.
In those pictures, the house looked really nice.	Wɔ saa mfonini ahorow no mu no, na ofie no te sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
They are more interested than you are.	Wɔn ani gye ho sen wo.
I just have to be myself	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ me ho ara kwa
Therefore, an additional factor seems necessary.	Enti, ɛte sɛ nea ɛho hia sɛ wɔde ade foforo bi ka ho.
Planning to head to school.	Nhyehyɛe a wɔyɛ de wɔn ani kyerɛ sukuu.
Can you find you.	So wubetumi anya wo.
And chances are, you are too.	Na hokwan ahorow wɔ hɔ sɛ, wo nso wowɔ saa.
It was amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I want you here with me	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me wɔ ha
I want it to be simple.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛnyɛ den.
And this book is just as new.	Na nhoma yi nso yɛ foforo saa ara.
I couldn’t sleep without what happened that night	Na mintumi nna a ɛnyɛ nea esii saa anadwo no
I wanted to go faster and faster	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ ntɛmntɛm na meyɛ ntɛm
And this is most important.	Na eyi ho hia sen biara.
I know it’s him right away.	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno ntɛm ara.
We have everything here.	Yɛwɔ biribiara wɔ ha.
I was the only one there	Ná me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ
I have done this before, at home.	Mayɛ eyi pɛn, wɔ fie.
I had no one to help me	Ná minni obi a ɔbɛboa me
That’s the way it is.	Saa na ɛte.
I thought I was very lucky	Misusuwii sɛ mewɔ anigye kɛse
I couldn’t figure out what it was	Na mintumi nhu nea ɛyɛ
With everything you have.	Ne biribiara a wowɔ.
I felt like such a girl	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ abeawa a ɔte saa
Real people live and work in them.	Nnipa ankasa te wɔn mu na wɔyɛ adwuma.
But we had each other.	Nanso na yɛwɔ yɛn ho yɛn ho.
A year ago, this would have been a phenomenon	Afe biako a atwam ni no, anka eyi bɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa
I’m glad you’re here!	Ɛyɛ me anigye sɛ wowɔ ha!
So please, enough.	Enti mesrɛ wo, ɛdɔɔso.
Any number of things.	Nneɛma dodow biara.
I can’t take it anymore	Mintumi nnye bio
I am very much looking forward to it	Mehwɛ kwan paa
I work from the inside out.	Meyɛ adwuma fi mu kɔ akyi.
There is no one to help you.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔbɛboa wo.
I love all their music	M’ani gye wɔn nnwom nyinaa ho
A few hours at a time.	Nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi bere biara.
I think he’s excited to play with us	Misusuw sɛ n’ani agye sɛ ɔne yɛn bedi agoru
There are no good guys and no bad guys here.	Nnipa pa ne nnipa bɔne biara nni ha.
This is the truth.	Eyi ne nokware no.
This is very easy for the police.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye ma polisifo.
I never want to see him again	Mempɛ sɛ mihu no bio da
I believe you are on to something here	Migye di sɛ wowɔ biribi so wɔ ha
The man promised.	Ɔbarima no hyɛɛ bɔ.
I hope your week has been as wonderful as mine	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo dapɛn no ayɛ nwonwa te sɛ me de no
I think the long drive has affected both of us	Misusuw sɛ kar tenten no aka yɛn baanu nyinaa
Very few people are completely whole.	Nnipa kakraa bi pɛ na wɔyɛ mũ koraa.
This is the lower house.	Eyi ne ofie a ɛwɔ fam no.
I understand completely	Mete ase koraa
I loved it, all of it	M’ani gyee ho, ne nyinaa
I don’t have to talk about it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meka ho asɛm.
A few nodded in his direction	Kakraa bi maa wɔn ti so kyerɛɛ ne kwan
All you have to do is say it.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ara ne sɛ wobɛka.
You can’t see their eyes.	Worentumi nhu wɔn ani.
I am here, with you now	Mewɔ ha, me ne wo wɔ hɔ seesei
I didn’t know you knew him	Na minnim sɛ wunim no
And it would have been.	Na anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I knew that was impossible	Ná minim sɛ ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye
I have to tell you that	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka saa kyerɛ wo
When you bring him in, shave his head.	Sɛ wode no ba a, yi ne ti.
I just need to figure out what it is	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛyɛ ara kwa
This trend is only going to continue.	Saa su yi rekɔ so ara kwa.
You need to get to know him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no.
It wasn’t pretty.	Ná ɛnyɛ fɛ.
But he thought it didn’t really matter.	Nanso na osusuw sɛ na ɛho nhia ankasa.
No one gives a damn.	Obiara mfa asɛm biara mma.
It shouldn’t matter, really.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛho hia, ampa.
As you know.	Sɛnea wunim no.
This is completely wrong.	Eyi yɛ mfomso koraa.
The problem wasn’t there.	Ná ɔhaw no nni hɔ.
I wanted to talk to you about last night	Na mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa fa anadwo a etwaam no ho
For me it is, in this case.	Wɔ me fam no, ɛte saa, wɔ asɛm yi mu.
There are many reasons for this	Nneɛma pii nti na ɛte saa
I wonder what you might like	Misusuw nea ebia w’ani begye ho no ho
A statement that seems to.	Asɛm a ɛte sɛ nea.
I think they are a good thing	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ ade pa
I hope it is at least.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛte saa.
I had no role here	Ná minni dwuma biara wɔ ha
But no one comes for me.	Nanso obiara mma mma me.
Our story is a really big one.	Yɛn asɛm no yɛ asɛm kɛse ankasa.
So it’s true.	Enti ɛyɛ nokware.
Said.	Kaa.
he says that.	ɔka sɛ.
A girl has to be confident too, you know	Ɛsɛ sɛ abeawa nso de ne ho to ne ho so, wunim
Maybe he would hang out with me.	Ebia na ɔne me bɛbɔ.
The meeting ended.	Nhyiam no baa awiei.
I saw the man	Mihuu ɔbarima no
He was a child.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra.
I have something to do tonight	Mewɔ biribi a mɛyɛ anadwo yi
I absolutely love this picture	M’ani gye saa mfonini yi ho koraa
I saw his plan, but it was too late	Mihuu ne nhyehyɛe no, nanso na aka akyi dodo
And definitely food for thought.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ aduan a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho.
I didn’t know it at the time	Ná minnim saa bere no
None of us are like that.	Yɛn mu biara nni hɔ a ɔte saa.
I can’t handle it anymore	Mintumi nni ho dwuma bio
I just can’t see it that way.	Mintumi nhu no saa ara kɛkɛ.
I just did what I was told	Meyɛɛ nea wɔka kyerɛɛ me no ara kwa
It’s out there.	Ɛwɔ abɔnten hɔ.
They love it there.	Wɔn ani gye ho wɔ hɔ.
The city is put on hold.	Wɔde kurow no to baabi a wɔde wɔn ho to so.
It’s all possible.	Ne nyinaa betumi ayɛ.
I can’t say anything.	Mintumi nka hwee.
I better sign up now	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ mede me nsa hyɛ ase mprempren
There is something in this.	Biribi wɔ eyi mu.
There are two problems with this.	Ɔhaw abien na ɛwɔ eyi mu.
It was his right.	Ná ɛyɛ ne hokwan.
I didn’t know him before I took the classes	Ná minnim no ansa na mereyɛ adesua ahorow no
I know he must regret it	Minim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ odi ho yaw
But someone has to do it.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ.
I wasn’t the only one who was impressed	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na m’ani gyee ho
It’s not pretty.	Ɛnyɛ fɛ.
None of this is necessary.	Eyi mu biara ho nhia.
I knew it had to be	Ná minim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa
I saw the whole thing too	Mihuu ade no nyinaa nso
Their father.	Wɔn papa.
That’s quite a big city.	Ɛno yɛ kurow kɛse bi koraa.
It hardly seemed like enough information.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ nsɛm a ɛdɔɔso.
I really wanted to do something completely different.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi foforo koraa ankasa.
It’s definitely more complex.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den kɛse.
It’s important to me.	Ɛho hia me.
I knew that was not the case with any of us	Ná minim sɛ ɛnte saa wɔ yɛn mu biara fam
I think he did just that	Misusuw sɛ ɔno na ɔyɛɛ saa ara
It seems to be a common occurrence here.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ade a abu so wɔ ha.
Otherwise, you are in grave danger.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, wowɔ asiane kɛse mu.
He had no face.	Ná onni anim biara.
I hurry to my room.	Meyɛ ntɛm kɔ me dan mu.
I saw it just happening	Mihuu sɛ ɛrekɔ so ara kwa
I can't seem to find my shoes though	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nhu me mpaboa de, nanso
Forget him, man.	Wo werɛ mfi no, onipa.
I saw something on the floor	Mihuu biribi wɔ fam hɔ
We often forget this.	Yɛn werɛ taa fi eyi.
I am in such big trouble	Mewɔ ɔhaw kɛse a ɛte saa mu
I know that’s what you were told	Minim sɛ ɛno ne nea wɔka kyerɛɛ wo
Finally his hand fell to her side.	Awiei koraa no ne nsa hwee ne nkyɛn.
The first bite is always the best.	Nea edi kan a wɔka no yɛ nea eye sen biara bere nyinaa.
I really could never let myself fall in love with them	Ankasa na mintumi mma m’ani nnye wɔn ho da
I say everything.	Meka biribiara.
Just me and the kids.	Me ne mmofra no nkutoo.
It’s the name.	Ɛyɛ din no.
I wanted him to be someone else	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ obi foforo
He didn't want any.	Ná ɔmpɛ biara.
I want to do it all with you	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo yɛ ne nyinaa
I didn’t like the book.	Ná m’ani nnye nhoma no ho.
They need to do more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ pii.
There was nothing you could have done.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a anka wubetumi ayɛ.
Once upon a time, you knew what to do.	Bere bi a atwam no, wunim nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I haven’t been that excited in a long time	M’ani nnye ho saa bere tenten ni
The problem is, they do.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ, wɔyɛ saa.
We had some ideas about how things would look.	Ná yɛwɔ adwene ahorow bi wɔ sɛnea nneɛma bɛyɛ ho.
I had no idea what any of that meant	Ná minni nea ɛno mu biara kyerɛ ho adwene biara
This is my way.	Eyi a me kwan.
I couldn’t imagine what was happening at the time	Ná mintumi nsusuw nea na ɛrekɔ so saa bere no ho
However, I’m interested.	Nanso, m’ani gye ho.
Take the money.	Fa sika no.
I felt great for him, you know	Metee nka kɛse ma no, wunim
All you can see of me is my eyes.	Nea wubetumi ahu me ara ne m’ani.
I still have a lot to tell you	Meda so ara wɔ nsɛm pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo
True, but the problem is new.	Ɛyɛ nokware, nanso ɔhaw no yɛ foforo.
I love every part of you	M’ani gye wo fã biara ho
There have been years of studies on the subject.	Wɔde mfe pii ayɛ asɛm no ho adesua ahorow.
Do not be	Mma wonyɛ .
I wasn’t the only one who did this	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na meyɛɛ eyi
Either that or he never makes a mistake.	Ɛno anaasɛ ɔnyɛ mfomso da.
It didn’t seem so good.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ papa saa.
Lots of real problems	Ɔhaw ankasa pii
It has only three models.	Ɛwɔ kar ahorow abiɛsa pɛ.
He's doing good in the house.	Ɔreyɛ papa wɔ fie hɔ.
There is a lot of talk about that too.	Wɔka saa nso ho asɛm pii.
It has gone too far.	Akɔ akyiri dodo.
The first is the language problem.	Nea edi kan ne kasa ho haw.
I believe he did	Migye di sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa
I know that for a lot of people, it doesn’t	Minim sɛ wɔ nnipa pii fam no, ɛnyɛ saa
I went downstairs but he was there	Me kɔɔ fam nanso na ɔno no wɔ hɔ
I couldn’t take that	Na mintumi mfa saa asɛm no
I have no idea what it is	Minni nea ɛyɛ ho adwene biara
I should have done this days ago.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi nna bi a atwam ni.
I need to work on this	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi ho adwuma
At that moment, that night.	Saa bere no, saa anadwo no.
The accident happened that way.	Akwanhyia no sii saa.
Two different photographs.	Mfonini ahorow abien.
There was the home phone.	Na ofie telefon no wɔ hɔ.
His mind was amazed.	N’adwene yɛɛ no ​​nwonwa.
Maybe the season needed something else.	Ebia na bere no hia biribi foforo.
I had done this several times	Ná mayɛ eyi mpɛn pii
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia.
I know they are wonderful	Minim sɛ wɔyɛ nwonwa
A few tests also come into play.	Sɔhwɛ kakra nso ba mu.
I want you to know	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu
Or it would have been.	Anaasɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
We can’t do that.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
Hit them with something big.	Fa biribi kɛse bi bɔ wɔn.
However, I know what most people say about him	Nanso, minim nea nnipa dodow no ara ka fa ne ho
So most are wrong to say otherwise.	Enti dodow no ara di mfomso sɛ wɔka sɛ ɛnte saa.
This happened several times	Eyi sii mpɛn pii
He is good now.	Ɔyɛ papa mprempren.
So you know that’s the reason.	Enti wunim sɛ ɛno ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
But nothing is done.	Nanso biribiara nyɛ.
I had nowhere else to go	Ná minni baabi foforo a mɛkɔ
I didn’t need to know.	Ná enhia sɛ mihu.
I want you to know that you have resources	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu sɛ wowɔ nneɛma a wode bɛyɛ adwuma
I understand how great this is	Mete sɛnea eyi yɛ kɛse no ase
I can fill in the details later	Metumi ahyɛ nsɛm no mu nsɛm no ma akyiri yi
But two of them did.	Nanso wɔn mu baanu yɛɛ saa.
But everything has gone quite well.	Nanso biribiara akɔ yiye koraa.
I heard about what happened today	Metee nea esii nnɛ no ho asɛm
Do it quickly.	Yɛ no ntɛm.
At least not at all.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ koraa.
I know this part of the song	Minim dwom no fã yi
I guess he doesn’t really like me	Misusuw sɛ n’ani nnye me ho ankasa
But he was very busy those days	Nanso na onni adagyew koraa saa nna no
And no one is unhappy.	Na obiara nni hɔ a n’ani nnye.
No one knew where it was.	Ná obiara nnim baabi a ɛwɔ.
I watch you every day	Mehwɛ wo da biara da
I was one of these people.	Ná meyɛ saa nnipa yi mu biako.
And you have to do the same.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa ara.
That my wife stayed with me.	Sɛ me yere traa me nkyɛn.
Best served warm.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ wɔde ma a ɛyɛ hyew.
There is a time for everything.	Bere bi wɔ hɔ ma biribiara.
It’s not often that our boy brings home a girl.	Ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii na yɛn abarimaa no de abeawa bi ba fie.
Too many people just want this to end.	Nnipa pii dodo pɛ sɛ eyi ba awiei ara kwa.
Nothing could have saved any of us.	Anka biribiara ntumi nnye yɛn mu biara nkwa.
Just tell me about that.	Ka saa asɛm no kyerɛ me kɛkɛ.
I wanted to see a face	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu anim bi
He's having a party.	Ɔreyɛ apontow bi.
Always wish there was one more.	Bere nyinaa wo yam a anka biako bio wɔ hɔ.
I couldn’t figure out what was important	Na mintumi nhu nea ɛho hia no
They make it much less expensive.	Wɔyɛ no ma ɛyɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den pii.
We may use personal information to provide our own services.	Yebetumi de yɛn ho nsɛm adi dwuma de ama yɛn ankasa nnwuma.
He doesn’t like anyone.	Ɔmpɛ obiara asɛm.
I hope you know that	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wunim saa
I forgot to tell you last night	Me werɛ fii sɛ mɛka akyerɛ wo anadwo a etwaam no
It is a system.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
But nothing good ever comes out of it.	Nanso biribi pa biara mfi fa mu mma da.
This is them right here.	Eyi ne wɔn wɔ ha yi ara.
He was the only one who was no longer with her.	Ɔno nkutoo na na onni ne nkyɛn bio.
One should not be surprised.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obi ho dwiriw no.
I wonder what else he knows.	Misusuw sɛ dɛn bio na onim.
I felt so alone and helpless	Metee nka kɛse sɛ me nkutoo na mintumi nyɛ hwee
And they make the pictures.	Na wɔyɛ mfonini ahorow no.
The system was complicated.	Ná nhyehyɛe no yɛ den.
I knew it was wrong.	Ná minim sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
I have to keep moving, keep creating	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so tu, mekɔ so bɔ ade
I had nothing to say	Ná minni asɛm biara a mɛka
I can’t do that.	Mintumi nyɛ saa.
But he wasn’t doing anything.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ hwee.
I had taken first aid classes in school	Ná mayɛ mmoa a edi kan ho adesua wɔ sukuu mu
Was .	Na .
I was always watching you	Ná mehwɛ wo bere nyinaa
I wanted to know what it was like	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea ɛte
They are our children and they are real.	Wɔyɛ yɛn mma na wɔyɛ ankasa.
So that was a problem.	Enti na ɛno yɛ ɔhaw.
It’s painful.	Ɛyɛ yaw.
I know how hard it is for you	Minim sɛnea ɛyɛ den ma wo
We must be	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ .
He seemed warm.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ hyew.
Everything just works for me here.	Biribiara yɛ adwuma ma me ara kwa wɔ ha.
My mom would love it.	Me maame ani begye ho yiye.
This was not supposed to happen.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi ba.
And, it was exciting.	Na, na ɛyɛ anigye.
I thought it was all my fault	Misusuwii sɛ ne nyinaa yɛ me mfomso
It wasn’t a sexual glance.	Na ɛnyɛ nna ho ani a wɔde hwɛ ade.
I only saw him the other day.	Da a atwam no nkutoo na mihuu no.
Not very good after that.	Ɛnyɛ papa koraa wɔ ɛno akyi.
He is with my mother.	Ɔne me maame wɔ hɔ.
It’s pretty cool if you think about it.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye sɛ wususuw ho a.
It was just a guess.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho ara kwa.
I couldn’t think of anyone	Na mintumi nsusuw obiara ho
Never this bad pain.	Ɛnyɛ yaw bɔne yi da.
It was the same with his mother.	Ná ɛte saa ara wɔ ne maame fam.
But it wasn’t that backwards.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ nea wɔde kɔ akyi saa.
I'm good there.	Meyɛ papa wɔ hɔ.
The power is there.	Tumi no wɔ hɔ.
That’s how good they are.	Saa na wɔyɛ papa.
I've only had it for a year	Mewɔ no afe biako pɛ
I had a lot of interesting stuff in it.	Ná mewɔ nneɛma a ɛyɛ anigye pii wɔ mu.
I couldn’t imagine it.	Na mintumi nsusuw ho.
That’s when it matters.	Ɛno ansa na ɛho hia.
We cannot agree with this view.	Yɛrentumi ne saa adwene yi nyɛ adwene.
I had nowhere to go	Ná minni baabi a mɛkɔ
I looked at him with my eyes.	Mede m’ani hwɛɛ no.
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
I knew it was as true as he did	Ná minim sɛ ɛyɛ nokware te sɛ ɔno ara pɛ
No one knows anything about me.	Obiara nnim me ho biribiara.
I was weak before and all these things happened	Na meyɛ mmerɛw kan na saa nneɛma yi nyinaa sii
I have enough on my mind besides this	Mewɔ nea ɛdɔɔso wɔ m’adwene mu a eyi nka ho
I'm going to do the same.	Me deɛ, mɛyɛ saa ara.
And the simplicity worked for him	Na sɛnea na ɛyɛ mmerɛw no yɛɛ adwuma maa no
He doesn’t do his best.	Ɔnyɛ nea obetumi biara.
And even if you don’t .	Na sɛ wo mpo anyɛ saa a .
I know exactly where he is.	Minim baabi a ɔwɔ no yiye.
Look at how beautiful you are.	Hwɛ sɛnea wo ho yɛ fɛ no.
I didn’t have time to tell you	Na minni bere a mede bɛka akyerɛ wo
You are a group.	Woyɛ kuw bi.
I wanted to talk to you after class too	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa wɔ adesua akyi nso
He would have been a good dad.	Anka ɔbɛyɛ papa pa.
However, I didn’t always do that	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na meyɛ saa
What a child like that would look like.	Hwɛ sɛnea abofra a ɔte saa bɛyɛ.
After all, it works.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, ɛyɛ adwuma.
I'll give myself to you	Mede me ho bɛma wo
Or a part of me.	Anaasɛ me fã bi.
It was just one day of the week.	Ná ɛyɛ dapɛn no mu da koro pɛ.
Anyway, a few of them.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, wɔn mu kakra.
On everything and nothing.	Wɔ biribiara so na biribiara nni hɔ.
You just put it there.	Wode to hɔ ara kwa.
Obviously not our job.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ yɛn adwuma no.
I kind of see it, but it’s not really true	Mete sɛ nea mihu no, nanso ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa
If possible.	Sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye a.
This is not a police thing.	Eyi nyɛ polisifo ade.
I just wanted you to know that this is happening	Nea na mepɛ sɛ wuhu ara ne sɛ eyi rekɔ so
It has been since then.	Ɛyɛ fi saa bere no.
And the people who do that.	Na nnipa a wɔyɛ saa nso.
But maybe not really.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ saa ankasa.
Like every day.	Te sɛ da biara da.
But it is definitely wrong.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
I hoped my words were true	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ me nsɛm no yɛ nokware
I would have thought I was alone	Anka misusuw sɛ me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ
And he was amazing.	Na ɔyɛ nwonwa.
Everything was new.	Ná biribiara yɛ foforo.
And the kid got involved.	Na abofra no de ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
There was no joy, no joy.	Ná anigye biara nni hɔ, na anigye biara nni hɔ.
He was in deep pain.	Ná odi yaw paa.
But this time, it didn’t matter.	Nanso saa bere yi de, na ɛho nhia.
So very cold, so very cold.	Awɔw kɛse saa, awɔw kɛse saa.
Like at home.	Te sɛ nea ɛwɔ fie.
I want to work with them as little as possible	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wɔn bɛyɛ adwuma kakraa bi sɛnea metumi biara
I didn’t want to do those things.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa nneɛma no.
You will tell me the truth.	Wobɛka nokware akyerɛ me.
I have to do the same for him	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa ara ma no
All the other stuff.	Nneɛma a aka no nyinaa.
I loved this picture	M’ani gyee mfonini yi ho
It just has to work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
Everything should be fine.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribiara yɛ yiye.
So many cars like that.	Kar pii a ɛte saa.
He uses conventions in the mind.	Ɔde nhyiam ahorow di dwuma wɔ adwene no mu.
I saw a car driving down the street	Mihuu kar bi a ɛrekɔ abɔnten
I need to report this to the police.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka eyi ho asɛm kyerɛ polisifo.
This is a dangerous thing.	Eyi yɛ asiane.
I had no control over them	Ná minni wɔn so tumi biara
After a moment, he put his foot on the edge.	Bere tiaa bi akyi no, ɔde ne nan sii ano.
But that didn’t really mean anything.	Nanso na ɛno nkyerɛ hwee ankasa.
But everyone else has to follow suit.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ obiara a aka no di wɔn akyi.
I know about the whole thing.	Minim asɛm no nyinaa ho asɛm.
But it was terrible	Nanso na ɛyɛ hu
He had an apartment in the city which he used during the week.	Ná ɔwɔ dan bi wɔ kurow no mu a ɔde dii dwuma wɔ dapɛn no mu.
He was happy to be able to talk about it.	Ná n’ani agye sɛ obetumi aka ho asɛm.
I want to know better	Mepɛ sɛ mihu yiye
Again, we can do this.	Bio nso, yebetumi ayɛ eyi.
A little window dressing	Mfɛnsere mu ade a wɔde hyɛ mu kakra
It feels great to me.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse ma me.
I didn’t see those people	Ná m’ani nhu saa nkurɔfo no
And we can’t take any more chances.	Na yɛrentumi mfa hokwan biara nni dwuma bio.
My plan had worked.	Ná me nhyehyɛe no ayɛ adwuma.
The summer movie season is the best.	Awɔw bere mu sini bere no ne nea eye sen biara.
I can end your life too	Me nso metumi de wo nkwa aba awiei
I have no idea of ​​the problem	Minni ɔhaw no ho adwene biara
This is just my opinion.	Eyi yɛ m’adwene ara kwa.
You can save us.	Wubetumi agye yɛn nkwa.
He seemed to be doing a good job.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɔreyɛ adwuma pa.
This would make this task completely unnecessary.	Eyi bɛma adwuma yi ayɛ nea ɛho nhia koraa.
It’s not true.	Ɛnyɛ nokware.
You don’t have to admit it.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wugye tom.
So you know when it’s old	Enti wunim bere a ɛyɛ dedaw
I will include it in this book as well	Mede bɛka saa nhoma yi nso ho
Few were interested.	Kakraa bi na wɔn ani gyee ho.
Attend the meeting.	Kɔ nhyiam no ase.
I want to do them now	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ wɔn mprempren
The study was brief.	Adesua no yɛɛ tiaa.
That is not how the meeting will go.	Ɛnyɛ saa na nhyiam no bɛkɔ so.
I just didn’t want to hear it	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete kɛkɛ
I was under the girl.	Ná mewɔ abeawa no ase.
I really need to sleep now	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda mprempren ankasa
Not in front of that boy.	Ɛnyɛ saa abarimaa no anim.
He didn't know what to do next.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛyɛ akyi.
Everything is easier for you, so easier.	Biribiara yɛ mmerɛw ma wo, enti ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
It wasn’t winter.	Ná ɛnyɛ awɔw bere.
I wasn’t doing that.	Ná menyɛ saa.
I slipped back to it.	Mede me ho san kɔɔ so.
He didn't want to be a monster.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ aboa kɛse.
I had to tell them where you were	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka baabi a wowɔ kyerɛ wɔn
Very good indeed.	Ɛyɛ papa paa ampa.
It works well for me.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ma me.
I know you were there last night	Minim sɛ na wowɔ hɔ anadwo a etwaam no
I had to look good too	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ me nso me ho yɛ fɛ
I want to use my imagination	Mepɛ sɛ mede m’adwene di dwuma
The leather is very soft and very soft.	Aboa nhoma no yɛ mmerɛw yiye na ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
It’s our pleasure.	Ɛyɛ yɛn anigye.
Take a closer look.	Hwɛ no yiye.
I can’t take that chance	Mintumi mfa saa hokwan no
It was amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I had a situation.	Ná mewɔ tebea bi.
I don’t know if that’s true.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno yɛ nokware anaa.
We have a man.	Yɛwɔ ɔbarima bi.
But it didn’t seem to work.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea anyɛ adwuma.
This is the smartest thing to do.	Eyi yɛ ade a nyansa wom sen biara a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I want to do something about it.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ho biribi.
And think about this.	Na susuw eyi ho hwɛ.
He wasn’t here.	Ná onni ha.
I don’t even know, to be honest with you.	Minnim mpo, sɛ mɛka nokware akyerɛ wo a.
I have been doing that since the first week	Mayɛ saa fi dapɛn a edi kan no
I just want you to be happy	Mepɛ sɛ w’ani gye ara kwa
I think you’re right	Misusuw sɛ woayɛ no yiye
I admire your work so much	M’ani gye wo adwuma no ho kɛse
Just one weekend.	Dapɛn awiei biako pɛ.
I can’t see anything.	Mintumi nhu ade.
A piece of paper.	Krataa bi a wɔde ayɛ krataa.
I don’t really like it yet	M’ani nnye ho ankasa de besi nnɛ
But if one of them, what can he do.	Nanso sɛ wɔn mu biako a, dɛn na obetumi ayɛ.
Or your time, today.	Anaasɛ wo bere, nnɛ.
I’m almost excited for that day to come	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ m’ani agye sɛ saa da no bɛba
Most are still missing.	Dodow no ara da so ara nni hɔ.
There is one in almost every city.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biako wɔ kurow biara mu.
I really need to know what you do	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea woyɛ ankasa
He already knew it all.	Ná onim ne nyinaa dedaw.
I want you to think about this	Mepɛ sɛ wususuw eyi ho
Each of them said something.	Wɔn mu biara kaa asɛm bi.
I only have two hands	Mewɔ nsa abien pɛ
I know you do, obviously you do	Minim sɛ woyɛ, ɛda adi sɛ woyɛ saa
It was a huge undertaking.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse bi.
It was a great gesture.	Ná ɛyɛ nyansa kɛse.
After that, it’s totally up to you.	Ɛno akyi no, ɛyɛ wo koraa.
They are locked up.	Wɔde to mu.
I told you not to	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ ma ɛnte saa
He was warmly welcomed	Wɔde anigye gyee no
You have to find out in the end.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu wɔ awiei koraa no.
And you can do it for hours.	Na wubetumi ayɛ no nnɔnhwerew pii.
I immediately wanted to do my best to please him	Ntɛm ara na mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nea metumi biara sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a n’ani begye ho
Do a great job.	Yɛ adwuma kɛse.
Be sure to get some things done today.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wobɛyɛ nneɛma bi nnɛ.
I think it will be delivered	Misusuw sɛ wɔde bɛma
We can’t take anything.	Yɛrentumi nnye hwee.
This is not easy.	Eyi nyɛ mmerɛw.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Minnim nea mɛyɛ, ampa.
It’s not like that.	Ɛnyɛ saa.
I cannot thank them enough	Mintumi nna wɔn ase sɛnea ɛsɛ
Like being a kid again.	Te sɛ abofra a wobɛyɛ bio.
He’s just too happy here.	N’ani gye ho wɔ ha dodo ara kwa.
Take care of them.	Hwɛ wɔn yiye.
I did it that way	Meyɛɛ no ​​saa kwan no so
But he knew nothing.	Nanso na onnim hwee.
Images of the mind.	Adwene ho mfonini ahorow.
I couldn’t do it for him	Na mintumi nyɛ mma no
I wish he could see me now.	Me yam a anka obetumi ahu me mprempren.
What I've done.	Nea mayɛ.
If you do, remember one thing.	Sɛ woyɛ saa a, kae ade biako.
I want to see something soon	Mepɛ sɛ mihu biribi nnansa yi ara
I could never deal with that	Na mintumi nni saa asɛm no ho dwuma da
I can’t let it out of my sight now	Mintumi mma no mfi m’ani so mprempren
If you can, switch to another location.	Sɛ wubetumi a, dan kɔ baabi foforo.
I can give you amazing results in no time	Metumi de aba a ɛyɛ nwonwa ama wo wɔ bere tiaa bi mu
He has to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
There were several reasons for this.	Ná nneɛma pii nti na ɛte saa.
He has something about us.	Ɔwɔ biribi fa yɛn ho.
Better than in pictures.	Ɛyɛ papa sen sɛ ɛwɔ mfonini ahorow mu.
They even put a gun on the table	Wɔde tuo mpo too pon no so
I see a lot of him.	Mihu ne ho pii.
I can do much better.	Metumi ayɛ yiye kɛse.
What is going on?.	Dɛn na ɛrekɔ so?.
But no one knows for sure.	Nanso obiara nnim no yiye.
I had nothing	Ná minni hwee
It is not new in this regard.	Ɛnyɛ ade foforo wɔ eyi mu.
My mom was making my bed.	Ná me maame reyɛ me mpa.
Just check it out.	Hwɛ mu kɛkɛ.
This only takes a few days.	Eyi gye nna kakraa bi pɛ.
I always knew there was something else in your past	Ná minim bere nyinaa sɛ biribi foforo wɔ wo bere a atwam no mu
Move with him.	Tu ne no tu kɔɔ baabi foforo.
There is nothing for you out there.	Biribiara nni hɔ mma wo wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
I have a bit of work to do tonight	Mewɔ adwuma kakra a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ anadwo yi
I’d be very happy with that result	M’ani begye saa aba no ho kɛse
Our friends.	Yɛn nnamfo.
I might even like it	Ebia m’ani begye ho mpo
Tell us about our story.	Ka yɛn asɛm no ho asɛm.
But in saying this, he has given the game away.	Nanso wɔ eyi a ɔka mu no, ɔde agoru no ama.
I had to keep moving	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so tu
The point was clear enough.	Ná asɛm no mu da hɔ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I feel like I have this right now.	Mete nka sɛ mewɔ eyi mprempren ara.
I always want to be with him	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no tra bere nyinaa

I was very young and interested	Ná meyɛ abofra paa a m’ani gye ho
I wanted him to do it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I can't see what's going on anymore	Mintumi nhu nea ɛrekɔ so bio
It must be very difficult.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den yiye.
There is something for every person.	Biribi wɔ hɔ ma onipa biara.
This is the big day.	Eyi ne da kɛse no.
This can be another great idea for a story.	Eyi betumi ayɛ adwene kɛse foforo ama asɛm bi.
I think he's involved	Misusuw sɛ ɔde ne ho ahyɛ mu
I didn’t want to see this	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu eyi
I could do less and less	Ná metumi ayɛ kakraa bi na mayɛ kakraa bi
He made the plays he needed to make.	Ɔyɛɛ agoru ahorow a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no.
I just wanted to know how you were doing	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea wo ho te ara kwa
However, I can’t leave the job to get to that.	Nanso, mintumi mfi adwuma no mu nkɔ saa ade no ho.
I have no problem with the police	Me ne polisifo nni ɔhaw biara
There was no time now.	Ná bere nni hɔ mprempren.
There was something else.	Na biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
Try.	Bɔ mmɔden.
Doing so is quite simple.	Saa a wobɛyɛ no yɛ mmerɛw koraa.
Keep things simple for yourself.	Ma nneɛma nyɛ mmerɛw mma wo ho.
I was hurt by what he said about me.	Nsɛm a ɔka faa me ho no yɛɛ me yaw.
This is no longer a problem.	Eyi nyɛ ɔhaw bio.
They all fell from time to time.	Wɔn nyinaa hwee ase bere ne bere mu.
I thought it might be something you could use	Misusuwii sɛ ebia ɛbɛyɛ biribi a wubetumi de adi dwuma
He knew what he wanted.	Ná onim nea ɔpɛ.
I haven't been able to reach anyone for days	Nna pii ni a mintumi nkɔ obiara nkyɛn
Something terrible happened	Ade bi a ɛyɛ hu sii
I have the basement all to myself	Mewɔ dan ase no nyinaa ma me ho
However, for some reason it doesn’t work.	Nanso, biribi nti ɛnyɛ adwuma.
Or he had them there.	Anaasɛ na ɔwɔ wɔn wɔ hɔ.
However, I didn’t really know anything	Nanso, na minnim hwee ankasa
I talked to people about him	Me ne nkurɔfo kaa ne ho asɛm
I can handle it.	Metumi adi ho dwuma.
I keep wondering if it really matters	Mekɔ so susuw ho sɛ ebia ɛho hia ankasa anaa
He’s a really strong guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔyɛ den ankasa.
But it still works.	Nanso ɛda so ara yɛ adwuma.
His head was almost clear enough.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ne ti mu da hɔ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
That’s the best way again.	Ɛno ne ɔkwan a eye sen biara bio.
It was a different situation.	Ná ɛyɛ tebea foforo.
It’s bad nonetheless.	Ɛyɛ bɔne ne nyinaa mu.
He knew he had to talk about it.	Ná onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka ho asɛm.
Apply it to yourself.	Fa di dwuma wɔ wo ho.
It’s quite complicated.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den koraa.
Don’t have a house party.	Mma ofie apontow.
However, it was expensive.	Nanso, na ne bo yɛ den.
But it’s also a temporary face.	Nanso ɛyɛ bere tiaa mu anim nso.
This is great, so glad you're here.	Eyi yɛ kɛse, enti anigye sɛ wowɔ ha.
Think about that one.	Susuw saa biako no ho hwɛ.
Make this happen.	Ma eyi nyɛ yiye.
I'm in a lot of pain.	Me ho yɛ me yaw paa.
Lots of fun at a great price.	Anigye pii wɔ bo kɛse so.
I don't know where the door is	Minnim baabi a ɔpon no wɔ
It’s not going away.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛrekɔ.
I think you’ll enjoy it	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ho
I know someone who can help	Minim obi a obetumi aboa
I immediately looked down	Mede m’ani too fam ntɛm ara
I wasn’t strong enough.	Ná me ho nyɛ den.
It was difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den.
I can’t think much of it	Mintumi nsusuw ho pii
I think he needs to work	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma
Like one of those new cars.	Te sɛ saa kar foforo no mu biako.
I can do this completely alone	Me nkutoo metumi ayɛ eyi koraa
My mother seems to be doing well.	Ɛte sɛ nea me maame reyɛ yiye.
This is not true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware.
I know him best	Minim no yiye sen biara
It hurts me to this day	Ɛyɛ me yaw de besi nnɛ
I want it wrong more than anything	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso sen biribiara
At the time, I didn’t really think much of it.	Saa bere no, na minsusuw ho pii ankasa.
I was in class, when this happened	Na mewɔ adesua mu, bere a eyi sii no
And so it was with him.	Na saa ara na na ɔte.
It’s really amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
But only if we do it.	Nanso sɛ yɛyɛ no nkutoo a.
His first performance was very impressive.	Nea edi kan a ɔde yɛɛ adwuma no yɛɛ nwonwa yiye.
He’s hot.	Ɔyɛ hyew.
You will be comfortable here.	Wo ho bɛtɔ wo wɔ ha.
But there is a point.	Nanso asɛm bi wɔ hɔ.
I had to act at the first opportunity	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ho biribi wɔ hokwan a edi kan no mu
Accept help when someone offers it.	Gye mmoa tom bere a obi de ama wo no.
But it’s fun.	Nanso ɛyɛ anigye.
I couldn’t take it anymore	Na mintumi mfa no bio
I want to do them both, absolutely.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa, koraa.
I feel so amazing right now	Mete nka sɛ me ho yɛ nwonwa yiye mprempren
That was when he felt better.	Saa bere no na ne ho tɔɔ no.
Keep saying positive things to yourself.	Kɔ so ka nsɛm a ɛyɛ papa kyerɛ wo ho.
I really like the idea	M’ani gye adwene no ho yiye
But everything went well.	Nanso biribiara kɔɔ so yiye.
I have school and friends.	Mewɔ sukuu ne me nnamfo.
Work went on anyway.	Adwuma kɔɔ so ɔkwan biara so.
It’s their business.	Ɛyɛ wɔn asɛm.
I had him in school.	Ná mewɔ no wɔ sukuu mu.
Take my hand, if you will.	Fa me nsa, sɛ wopɛ a.
I don’t know if that’s the case.	Minnim sɛ ɛte saa anaa.
I had so much to do yesterday	Ná mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nnɛra
Always has been, and always will be.	Bere nyinaa na ɛte saa, na ɛbɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
I think he’s a bit of a strong guy	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ den kakra
The potential was still there.	Ná tumi a ɛwɔ hɔ no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
Not his wife, not his kids, it was me.	Ɛnyɛ ne yere, ɛnyɛ ne mma, na ɛyɛ me.
I am still thankful for this	Meda so ara da ase wɔ eyi ho
I couldn’t keep going	Na mintumi nkɔ so nkɔ so
He had the rest.	Ná aka no.
I didn’t care after the first season.	Na ɛnyɛ me asɛm wɔ bere a edi kan no akyi.
And he knew something else.	Na na onim ade foforo nso.
I don't like that.	M'ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
It still feels like the summer will come in the winter.	Ɛda so ara te nka sɛ awɔw bere no bɛba awɔw bere mu.
He liked that too.	Ná n’ani gye saa nso ho.
A few hours ago, that was a big deal.	Nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi a atwam no, na ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse.
But those days are long gone.	Nanso saa nna no atwam akyɛ.
His song brought me to an end.	Ne dwom no de me baa awiei.
I may have to do this more often	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi mpɛn pii
The first part of the plan had certainly worked.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na nhyehyɛe no fã a edi kan no ayɛ adwuma.
I completely understood	Metee ase koraa
He was strong, and he was strong .	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ den, na na ne ho yɛ den .
However, this is the problem.	Nanso, eyi ne ɔhaw no.
It was a pleasure.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye.
Less money should be enough	Ɛsɛ sɛ sika kakraa bi na ɛdɔɔso
It has been good and bad.	Ayɛ papa ne bɔne.
And it has happened.	Na aba saa.
I couldn’t help myself	Na mintumi nyɛ me ho hwee
Which may not be much.	Nea ebia ɛnyɛ pii.
He was really excited.	Ná n’ani agye ankasa.
But in the end, he liked it	Nanso awiei koraa no, n’ani gyee ho
I didn’t like it at all	Ná m’ani nnye ho koraa
This is also important.	Eyi nso ho hia.
Long hot summers will come and go	Awɔw bere tenten a ɛyɛ hyew bɛba na akɔ
Everything in this room.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ saa dan yi mu.
It was a lot of fun.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
I can’t tell any of them.	Mintumi nka nkyerɛ wɔn mu biara.
I had never thought about that	Ná minsusuw saa asɛm no ho da
I saw this from here.	Mihuu eyi fii ha.
His father needed him.	Ná ne papa hia no.
That’s why I’m here.	Ɛno nti na mewɔ ha no.
Even his bed is gone.	Ne mpa mpo nni hɔ bio.
He points towards the door.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛ ɔpon no ano.
I think you can do amazing things	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi ayɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa
Something else did.	Biribi foforo nso yɛɛ saa.
I don’t think he has anyone out there.	Minsusuw sɛ ɔwɔ obiara wɔ abɔnten.
Maybe I didn’t have to tell you that	Ebia na enhia sɛ meka saa kyerɛ wo
It’s really expensive.	Ɛyɛ nea ne bo yɛ den ankasa.
This can only mean one thing.	Eyi betumi akyerɛ ade biako pɛ.
I am very much looking forward to it	Mehwɛ kwan paa
He knows it himself.	Ɔno ankasa nim.
I have no problem with that, good for you	Minni ɔhaw biara wɔ saa asɛm no ho, eye ma wo
I need to talk to both of you	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne mo baanu nyinaa kasa
He had done the best things.	Ná wayɛ nneɛma a eye sen biara.
I only got his name this morning	Me nsa kaa ne din anɔpa yi nkutoo
However, I need to act quickly	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ho biribi ntɛm
Or at least the one that used to be the house.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, nea kan no na ɛyɛ ofie no.
It didn’t matter that it wasn’t true.	Na ɛnyɛ asɛm sɛ ɛnyɛ nokware.
I have no idea why he wanted the child	Minnim nea enti a na ɔpɛ abofra no ho adwene biara
We have our hands full.	Yɛwɔ yɛn nsa a ɛyɛ ma.
I had no idea where this was going to go	Ná minnim baabi a eyi bɛkɔ
I knew that city inside and out	Ná minim saa kurow no mu ne akyi
And without a doubt, it was.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, na ɛte saa.
There was no hope left.	Ná anidaso nni hɔ bio.
I just couldn’t think of him the same way	Na mintumi nsusuw ne ho saa ara kɛkɛ
I have two faces	Mewɔ anim abien
Working in that field.	Adwuma a wɔyɛ wɔ saa adwuma no mu.
I think they do it the same way	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ no saa ara
It’s just not true.	Ɛnyɛ nokware kɛkɛ.
I don’t like going out now.	M’ani nnye ho sɛ mɛkɔ abɔnten mprempren.
I can’t tell you anything more	Mintumi nka biribi nkyerɛ wo bio
I offered the girl a drink	Mede nsa bi maa abeawa no
I saw you today.	Mihuu wo nnɛ.
I see him there.	Mihu no wɔ hɔ.
I didn’t know what else to say to him	Na minnim nea mɛka akyerɛ no bio
On one street.	Wɔ abɔnten biako so.
I couldn’t understand that.	Ná mintumi nte saa asɛm no ase.
We do that.	Yɛyɛ saa.
You, too, are not.	Wo nso, ɛnte saa.
There are many problems in your eyes.	Ɔhaw pii wɔ w’ani so.
But that’s what’s happening, and again, no one seems to care.	Nanso ɛno ne nea ɛrekɔ so, na bio, ɛte sɛ nea obiara mfa ne ho.
This incident happened very quickly.	Saa asɛm yi sii ntɛmntɛm paa.
I know your pain is great	Minim sɛ wo yaw no yɛ kɛse
I can get used to this.	Metumi ayɛ eyi ho su.
I just keep missing how young you are	Me werɛ kɔ so fi sɛnea woyɛ abofra no ara kwa
What a wonderful thing.	Hwɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa bɛn ara ni.
Whatever it is you want.	Nea ɛyɛ biara a wopɛ.
According to this.	Sɛnea eyi kyerɛ no.
Part of it does live in me	Ne fã bi te me mu ampa
I couldn’t take it down the first few times	Na mintumi mfa nkɔ fam mpɛn kakraa a edi kan no
Very cold and so wonderful.	Awɔw kɛse na ɛyɛ nwonwa saa.
Nothing else matters to me.	Biribiara foforo biara mfa me ho.
This chapter is about those mistakes.	Saa ti yi fa saa mfomso ahorow no ho.
I just wanted her to like me	Ná mepɛ sɛ n’ani gye me ho ara kwa
I didn’t even know it existed.	Ná minnim mpo sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
Disaster had been bad enough.	Ná asiane ayɛ bɔne sɛnea ɛsɛ.
There is no unnecessary risk.	Asiane a ɛho nhia biara nni hɔ.
The phone was his only hope	Ná telefon nkutoo ne anidaso a ɔwɔ
I stayed there for about a year	Mede bɛyɛ afe biako traa hɔ
You can start over.	Wubetumi afi ase bio.
There was so much food, so much hope.	Ná aduan pii wɔ hɔ, anidaso pii wɔ hɔ.
We could have done more.	Anka yebetumi ayɛ pii.
I was taken to a room	Wɔde me kɔɔ dan bi mu
He is now.	Ɔyɛ mprempren.
Almost something for everyone	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biribi a ɛwɔ hɔ ma obiara
He had brought it for a reason.	Ná biribi nti na ɔde aba.
After a short time	Bere tiaa bi akyi no .
No one ever gets the chance to do that.	Obiara nnya hokwan nyɛ saa da.
I wonder what he will do now	Misusuw nea ɔbɛyɛ mprempren ho
People showed up over the next two hours.	Nkurɔfo baa wɔn ho adi wɔ nnɔnhwerew abien a edi hɔ no mu.
There is no room for us anymore.	Baabi biara nni ha ma yɛn bio.
I had no idea what it would be, but it was true.	Ná minnim nea ɛbɛyɛ, nanso na ɛyɛ nokware.
I didn’t care what his opinion was	Ná nea n’adwene yɛ no mfa me ho
And the food, too.	Na aduan no nso.
I told him it was my car	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛyɛ me kar
It was not an easy task.	Ná ɛnyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I had school and friends who spent my time.	Ná mewɔ sukuu ne nnamfo a wɔde me bere.
I need to see you now	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu wo mprempren
I think people will be really happy	Misusuw sɛ nkurɔfo ani begye ankasa
So, one suspects he had bad hair too.	Enti, obi susuw sɛ na ɔno nso ti nhwi bɔne.
But it was necessary.	Nanso na ɛho hia.
He had another job.	Ná ɔwɔ adwuma foforo bi.
Please tell me.	Mesrɛ wo kyerɛ me.
Check out their music here.	Hwɛ wɔn nnwom wɔ ha.
They are interested in him.	Wɔn ani gye ne ho.
I want to tell him something	Mepɛ sɛ meka biribi kyerɛ no
It just wasn’t quite enough.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso koraa kɛkɛ.
There was no doubt about it.	Ná akyinnye biara nni ho.
So he had done it right.	Enti na wayɛ no yiye.
Maybe it’s true.	Ebia ɛyɛ nokware.
I know you really like this guy	Minim sɛ w’ani gye saa ɔbarima yi ho ankasa
I think they were the only two you knew.	Misusuw sɛ na wɔn baanu nkutoo na wunim wɔn.
I didn’t want to go down there.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mekɔ fam wɔ hɔ.
And the work continues.	Na adwuma no kɔ so.
I have something to do	Mewɔ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ
They have to be done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ mu.
Sounds pretty doesn't it.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ so ɛnte saa.
I can see how to create a new party and add users.	Metumi ahu sɛnea wɔyɛ apontow foforo na wɔde wɔn a wɔde di dwuma no ka ho.
I couldn’t tell him	Na mintumi nka nkyerɛ no
Mistakes can happen quickly in that situation.	Mfomso betumi asi ntɛm wɔ saa tebea no mu.
I see how much you like him	Mihu sɛnea w’ani gye ne ho kɛse
I think he really likes it here.	Misusuw sɛ n’ani gye ho ankasa wɔ ha.
I wanted to bring it to school	Ná mepɛ sɛ mede ba sukuu
You’ll be happy with him.	W’ani begye ne ho.
This was not a test.	Ná eyi nyɛ sɔhwɛ.
It was one of those things.	Ná ɛyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biako.
He slammed his head against the door.	Ɔde ne ti bɔɔ ɔpon no mu.
I put my hand on the handle	Mede me nsa too nsa no so
I couldn’t do anything.	Na mintumi nyɛ hwee.
I have nothing to offer you	Minni biribiara a mede bɛma wo
I just saw something	Mihuu biribi ara kwa
I feel more and more attracted to them	Mete nka sɛ m’ani gye wɔn ho na m’ani gye wɔn ho kɛse
There are many different things to know.	Nneɛma ahorow pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
And what a face it was.	Na hwɛ anim a na ɛyɛ.
I don’t think anyone even knew it existed	Minsusuw sɛ na obiara nim mpo sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ
Take some time outside.	Fa bere kakra fi abɔnten.
Maybe he was on to something, maybe he wasn’t.	Ebia na ɔwɔ biribi so, ebia ɔnyɛ saa.
It’s a true story.	Ɛyɛ nokware.
A time or two.	Bere biako anaa abien.
If you know anything, tell me.	Sɛ wunim biribi a, ka kyerɛ me.
Still not quite sure what to think.	Ɛda so ara nnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho yiye.
I hope that's not too complicated	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno nyɛ nea ɛyɛ den dodo
He really didn't know how to talk about it.	Ankasa na onnim sɛnea ɔbɛka asɛm no ho asɛm.
The content is very good.	Nsɛm a ɛwɔ mu no yɛ papa yiye.
And you will do it tonight.	Na wobɛyɛ no anadwo yi.
Take a closer look.	Hwɛ no yiye.
This article is from that book.	Saa asɛm yi fi saa nhoma no mu.
I have such a strong team	Mewɔ kuw a ɛyɛ den saa
No doubt you have one.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wowɔ bi.
I know it doesn’t work like that	Minim sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma saa
That must have been great.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛno yɛ kɛse.
I felt them, even in my sleep	Metee wɔn nka, wɔ me nna mu mpo
He has only one arm.	Ɔwɔ nsa biako pɛ.
I can do all sorts of things	Metumi ayɛ nneɛma ahorow nyinaa
I’m the one who saw it	Me na mihuu no
But, who knows.	Nanso, hena na onim.
There is not much time left.	Bere pii nni hɔ a aka.
Power couldn't see anything.	Tumi antumi anhu hwee.
And my mother, too.	Na me maame nso.
There’s some of that, sure.	Ɛno mu bi wɔ hɔ, ampa.
His manner was not that of a child.	Ná ne su no nyɛ abofra su.
He was really good.	Ɔyɛɛ papa ankasa.
He put me on the floor.	Ɔde me too fam.
Thank you so much for your work, and for your book.	Meda mo ase pii wɔ mo adwuma no ho, ne mo nhoma no ho.
So happy to be here.	Enti anigye sɛ mewɔ ha.
I can’t figure out what it is	Mintumi nhu nea ɛyɛ
I didn’t know what to say at the meeting.	Ná minnim nea mɛka wɔ nhyiam no ase.
I believe that is true.	Migye di sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
It’s too early.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo.
I often had nothing interesting to say	Mpɛn pii no, na minni biribi a ɛyɛ anigye a mɛka ho asɛm
He had never done that before.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa da.
I nodded my head	Mede me ti bɔɔ mu
Everything was going well.	Ná ne nyinaa rekɔ yiye.
I knew the situation would be better	Ná minim sɛ tebea no bɛyɛ papa
In all of them.	Wɔn nyinaa mu.
I put it to great use	Mede yɛɛ adwuma kɛse
I will do as you say	Mɛyɛ sɛnea woka no
I was very weak but alive	Ná meyɛ mmerɛw yiye nanso na mete ase
But he already knew who it was.	Nanso na onim onii a ɔwɔ hɔ dedaw.
Maybe you have one too.	Ebia wo nso wowɔ bi.
I like being strong and independent	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ den na mede me ho
It wasn’t fast enough.	Ná ɛnyɛ ntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Everything was great then and still running smoothly.	Na biribiara yɛ kɛse saa bere no na ɛda so ara kɔ so yiye.
Meet new people, go to parties, play games.	Hu nnipa foforo, kɔ apontow ase, di agoru.
That is a great plus.	Ɛno yɛ ade kɛse a wɔde ka ho.
It was actually a year.	Na ɛyɛ afe biako ankasa.
I wasn’t interested anymore	Ná m’ani nnye ho bio
I found you when you didn’t know it	Mihuu wo bere a na wunnim
You either do that, or you don’t.	Woyɛ saa, anaasɛ wonyɛ saa.
He hears things.	Ɔte nneɛma.
He was doing something.	Ná ɔreyɛ biribi.
Too much of this.	Eyi mu dodow no ara dodo.
The story ended there.	Asɛm no baa awiei wɔ hɔ.
We are absolutely thrilled with it.	Yɛn ani agye ho koraa.
He even seemed to dominate sexually.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea odi tumi wɔ nna mu mpo.
On the new book.	Wɔ nhoma foforo no so.
I just wanted to act all the time	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ade bere nyinaa ara kwa
Everyone is doing it.	Obiara reyɛ.
He was getting stronger.	Ná ɔreyɛ den kɛse.
I couldn’t sleep at night.	Ná mintumi nna anadwo.
I was good friends with both of them at the time.	Ná me ne wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ nnamfo pa saa bere no.
Check them out here.	Hwɛ wɔn wɔ ha.
He did it very well.	Ɔyɛɛ saa yiye paa.
That’s not what you want.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea wopɛ.
Many of them are not real.	Wɔn mu pii nyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
I wanted to enjoy music.	Ná mepɛ sɛ m’ani gye nnwom ho.
I really enjoyed that one.	M’ani gyee saa biako no ho ankasa.
That was terrible.	Ná ɛno ayɛ hu.
Something no one else knows.	Biribi a obi foforo nnim.
I would have been surprised.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ me nwonwa.
I am getting really fast and strong	Mereyɛ ntɛmntɛm ankasa na me ho yɛ den
If you look good, the two seem equal.	Sɛ wo ho yɛ fɛ a, ɛte sɛ nea abien no nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
I hoped it was at least	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛte saa
Nothing, nothing.	Biribiara nni hɔ, biribiara nni hɔ.
That is way too complicated.	Ɛno yɛ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ den dodo.
I think we can beat anyone	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi adi obiara so nkonim
I didn’t care anymore	Ná ɛnyɛ me asɛm bio
It was also recent.	Ná ɛyɛ nnansa yi ara nso.
They shouldn’t tell him.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔka kyerɛ no.
I believe he knew something	Migye di sɛ na onim biribi
I'm on it.	Mewɔ so.
I can handle it without knowing it	Metumi adi ho dwuma a minnim
I knew then what had happened	Saa bere no na minim nea asi
I believe our work is all about people	Migye di sɛ yɛn adwuma no nyinaa fa nnipa ho
He plays it, and he plays it well.	Ɔbɔ no, na ɔbɔ no yiye.
No idea at all.	Adwene biara nni ho koraa.
I look at that as that was me	Mehwɛ saa sɛnea na ɛno ne me no
I want to know what's inside	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛwɔ mu
I knew the truth.	Ná minim nokware no.
If the head is soft.	Sɛ ti no yɛ mmerɛw a.
He was very fond of them.	Ná n’ani gye wɔn ho kɛse.
The plans are temporary.	Nhyehyɛe ahorow no yɛ bere tiaa mu de.
I have to go all in with this	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ ne nyinaa mu de eyi
The reason for its popularity is simple, in my opinion.	Nea enti a ɛyɛ nea agye din no yɛ mmerɛw, wɔ m’adwene mu.
I wanted to take my time and look after myself	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye me bere na mehwɛ me ho yiye
Don’t tell me that.	Nka saa nkyerɛ me.
I think there will be trouble when he does	Misusuw sɛ ɔhaw bɛba bere a ɔyɛ saa no
I wasn’t feeling well at all	Ná me ho nyɛ me den koraa
But for this reason.	Nanso eyi nti.
I didn’t want to work	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma
What do you want to communicate from this story?.	Dɛn na wopɛ sɛ woka ho asɛm fi saa asɛm yi mu?.
This can be very expensive.	Eyi betumi ayɛ nea ne bo yɛ den yiye.
I want people to forget	Mepɛ sɛ nkurɔfo werɛ fi
I didn’t even know he existed	Ná minnim mpo sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ
That doesn’t mean it’s not true.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ nokware.
It was very, very impressive.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye paa.
A few have no windows.	Kakraa bi nni mfɛnsere.
That’s the plan.	Ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no.
Don't touch him.	Mfa wo nsa nka no.
I didn’t know him very well	Ná minnim no yiye
I thought about it a little bit	Misusuw ho kakra
What a powerful song.	Dwom a tumi wom bɛn ara ni.
I didn’t know how to be a mom	Ná minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ maame
I can’t accept something like that	Mintumi nnye biribi a ɛte saa
Again, it works just fine for me.	Bio nso, ɛyɛ adwuma ma me yiye ara kwa.
I just wanted to do a good job.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma pa ara kwa.
It’s not just about tonight.	Ɛnyɛ anadwo yi nkutoo ho asɛm.
I also didn’t have time to think about anything	Na minni bere nso mfa nsusuw biribiara ho
People say a lot of things.	Nkurɔfo ka nsɛm pii.
At the end of the month, you’re happy.	Sɛ ɔsram no ba awiei a, w’ani agye.
Unless you want them too.	Gye sɛ wo nso wopɛ wɔn.
We are not in power.	Yɛn nni tumi mu.
Here he is.	Ɔno ni.
Remind me of my wife.	Kae me kyerɛ me yere.
We can do it any old time.	Yebetumi ayɛ no bere dedaw biara.
I shrugged several times and scratched my head	Mede me nsa kyerɛɛ so mpɛn pii na mede me nsa kyerɛɛ me ti so
I want to make a play	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ agoru bi
I knew his situation here was good	Ná minim sɛ tebea a ɔwɔ wɔ ha no yɛ papa
That was the plan.	Ná ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no.
That’s what life is like.	Saa na nkwa te.
But that’s just one of them.	Nanso ɛno nkutoo ne wɔn biako.
And you’ll be happy to do it.	Na w’ani begye ho sɛ wobɛyɛ.
It obviously didn’t work.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I have no comment on the matter	Minni asɛm no ho asɛm biara ka
This is one of my favorite dishes.	Eyi yɛ aduan a m’ani gye ho paa no mu biako.
I can't seem to get a handle on it	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nnya nsa wɔ so
It seemed to be the same.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
He's too full of himself.	Ɔno ho ahyɛ no ma dodo.
Truth is growing, too.	Nokware reyɛ kɛse, nso.
I’m intrigued by the story	M’ani gyee asɛm no ho
I want you to come back with me	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me san ba
This story is new.	Saa asɛm yi yɛ foforo.
Thanks so much for all the pictures	Meda ase kɛse wɔ mfonini ahorow no nyinaa ho
This seems to control it.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi di so.
You are a good person.	Woyɛ onipa pa.
He wanted to do more.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ pii.
Not good, not in their minds.	Ɛnyɛ papa, ɛnyɛ wɔn adwene mu.
I can’t think of him now	Mintumi nsusuw ne ho mprempren
My son was gone.	Ná me ba no nni hɔ bio.
I’d even love to work there	M’ani begye ho mpo sɛ mɛyɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ
The work could begin.	Ná adwuma no betumi afi ase.
I couldn’t get it in me fast enough.	Na mintumi nnya bi wɔ me mu ntɛmntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I am looking forward to next year.	Mehwɛ afe a edi hɔ no kwan.
I hope so, nothing much to add	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa, biribiara nni hɔ a mede bɛka ho kɛse
It just seemed like a good idea.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwene pa ara kwa.
You were a perfect opportunity, boy.	Na woyɛ hokwan a edi mũ, abarimaa.
I love you, all of you	Mepɛ mo, mo nyinaa
These features generally consist of two components.	Mpɛn pii no, nneɛma abien na ɛwɔ saa nneɛma yi mu.
Just look below.	Hwɛ ase hɔ kɛkɛ.
And it wasn’t his idea.	Na ɛnyɛ n’adwene.
His feet are facing forward.	Ne nan hwɛ anim.
I'll go with him tonight	Me ne no bɛkɔ anadwo yi
A job that no one else can do.	Adwuma a obi foforo ntumi nyɛ.
The man had it.	Ná ɔbarima no wɔ no.
You involved in this.	Wo a wode wo ho ahyɛ eyi mu.
When you like someone, you like them.	Sɛ w’ani gye obi ho a, w’ani gye ne ho.
It’s not a pretty situation.	Ɛnyɛ tebea a ɛyɛ fɛ.
He was obviously the detail person in their group.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔno ne onipa a ɔde nsɛm kɔ akyiri wɔ wɔn kuw no mu.
I love that about you	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho wɔ wo ho
This seemed like a good idea.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ adwene pa.
I knew when you meant it	Ná minim bere a wopɛ sɛ woka
I know almost nothing about the incident	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ minnim asɛm a esii no ho hwee
As often as you can force yourself.	Mpɛn dodow a wubetumi ahyɛ wo ho no.
I’d really love it	M’ani begye ho ankasa
Or put a bullet in the back of his head.	Anaasɛ fa tuo bi hyɛ ne ti akyi.
I just couldn’t do it anymore	Na mintumi nyɛ bio kɛkɛ
I don't know which is more certain	Minnim nea ɛyɛ nokware sen saa
I have to be on you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ wo so.
It was painful.	Ná ayɛ yaw.
But there is actually another way.	Nanso ɔkwan foforo wɔ hɔ ankasa.
I felt good about the cast.	Metee nka yiye wɔ wɔn a wɔyɛ sini no ho.
There was just one problem.	Ná ɔhaw biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
People kept looking back and forth.	Nkurɔfo kɔɔ so hwɛɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho anim ne akyi.
I want them there too.	Mepɛ wɔn nso wɔ hɔ.
I don’t think of him this way	Minsusuw ne ho saa kwan yi so
I want it to be prioritized	Mepɛ sɛ wɔde di kan
I wanted to tell him about my mom and dad.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka me maame ne me papa ho asɛm kyerɛ no.
I couldn’t let myself believe that	Na mintumi mma me ho nnye saa asɛm no nni
He was the one who was being amazing.	Ɔno na na ɔreyɛ nwonwa.
I am not the culprit here	Ɛnyɛ me ne obi a ɔyɛ bɔne wɔ ha
Real cars will drive.	Kar ahorow ankasa bɛka.
I still have a lot of them	Meda so ara wɔ wɔn mu pii
I was the most important	Ná me na me ho hia sen biara
He did love to play.	Ná n’ani gye agoru ho ampa.
I do think of him, though	Nanso, misusuw ne ho ampa
However, your feedback is important to us.	Nanso, wo nsɛm a wobɛka no ho hia yɛn.
Every last one.	Nea etwa to biara.
I'm just not big on it.	Menyɛ kɛse wɔ ho kɛkɛ.
I was just there.	Ná mewɔ hɔ ara kwa.
I need to know how he is doing	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea ne ho te
And one was his car.	Na biako nso yɛ ne kar.
There’s just so much going on.	Nneɛma pii na ɛrekɔ so ara kwa.
It seems like my mom would just do something.	Ɛte sɛ nea anka me maame bɛyɛ biribi kɛkɛ.
That’s the real problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw ankasa.
I had so much to tell him	Ná mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no
You're free.	Wode wo ho.
No one really knew what was going on.	Ná obiara nnim nea ɛrekɔ so ankasa.
It had to be a mistake.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
He has made it a habit.	Ɔde ayɛ ne su.
I couldn’t imagine being with a man anymore	Na mintumi nsusuw ho sɛ me ne ɔbarima bi wɔ hɔ bio
I think these people enjoyed it as a game	Misusuw sɛ saa nkurɔfo yi ani gyee ho sɛ agoru
Many of us were like that back then	Ná yɛn mu pii te saa saa bere no
I can’t do anything.	Mintumi nyɛ hwee.
This is not a bad thing.	Eyi nyɛ ade bɔne.
I was on top of it all	Ná mewɔ ne nyinaa so
He was interested in it.	Ná n’ani gye ho.
This works as it should.	Eyi yɛ adwuma sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
I knew exactly what I had to do	Ná minim nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ no yiye
Just the story, maybe.	Asɛm no ara kwa, ebia.
Things will get better.	Nneɛma bɛkɔ yiye.
I know he’ll love it	Minim sɛ n’ani begye ho
It is not very clear what was inserted here.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛda adi yiye sɛ nea na wɔde hyɛɛ ha no yɛ.
You can pair these shoes with almost any outfit.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wubetumi de mpaboa yi abɔ atade biara ho.
I could also easily be even faster	Ná metumi nso ayɛ mmerɛw sɛ mɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm mpo
I was just making my way to the party	Ná meyɛ ne kwan so akɔ apontow no mu ara kwa
I can't find the final picture either	Mintumi nnya mfonini a etwa to no nso
That’s all he told us.	Ɛno ara ne nea ɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn.
This isn’t me.	Eyi nyɛ me.
The target was the door.	Ná nea wɔde wɔn ani asi so ne ɔpon no.
There are no other children.	Mmofra foforo biara nni hɔ.
I have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
I look into his eyes	Mehwɛ n’ani so
You should too, by the way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ saa, ɔkwan bi so no.
The new you is what you want to be.	Wo foforo no ne nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ.
My mind couldn’t believe it	Ná m’adwene ntumi nnye nni
At that point, the police arrived for the first time.	Saa bere no, polisifo no baa hɔ nea edi kan.
I really like this song	M’ani gye dwom yi ho paa
It’s not what it seems.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛte sɛ nea ɛte no.
But there is no chance.	Nanso hokwan biara nni hɔ.
However, that has nothing to do with telling the truth.	Nanso, ɛno ne nokware a wɔka no nni hwee yɛ.
I lived with him for almost two years	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ me ne no traa hɔ mfe abien
However, this is not always the case.	Nanso, eyi nte saa bere nyinaa.
He didn't know how many but one thing was for sure.	Ná onnim dodow ahe nanso na ade biako na ɛyɛ nokware.
I just took the opportunity to look at him	Mede hokwan no hwɛɛ no ​​ara kwa
I think you might as well know.	Misusuw sɛ ebia wunim saa ara.
A little goes a long way.	Kakraa bi kɔ akyiri.
Be a professional.	Yɛ obi a onim adwuma yiye.
That is absolutely true.	Ɛno yɛ nokware koraa.
I just wanted to.	Ná mepɛ ara kwa.
My father is not the father in the story.	Me papa nyɛ papa a ɔwɔ asɛm no mu.
But my kids have never done them.	Nanso me mma no nyɛɛ wɔn da.
It’s almost like you’re there.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wowɔ hɔ.
Step in here.	Fa wo nan hyɛ mu wɔ ha.
And it was so.	Na ɛte saa.
I told you the same thing	Meka kyerɛɛ wo saa ara
This isn’t much.	Eyi nyɛ pii.
I want everyone to get used to your presence	Mepɛ sɛ obiara de wo ba a wowɔ hɔ no yɛ ne su
I renew it every year the first week.	Meyɛ no foforo afe biara dapɛn a edi kan no.
He just wanted to be a part of something.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi fã kɛkɛ.
It still seems to be the case.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛda so ara te saa.
Everyone just went to work that day.	Obiara kɔɔ adwuma kɛkɛ saa da no.
But maybe it was something else.	Nanso ebia na ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
I cannot let this lie	Mintumi mma eyi nni atoro
I didn’t really know what was going on	Ná minnim nea ɛrekɔ so ankasa
This was a house, once.	Ná eyi yɛ ofie, bere bi.
The work was huge.	Ná adwuma no yɛ kɛse.
I however can do it anyway.	Me nanso metumi yɛ no saa ɔkwan biara so.
I had known him for a long time	Ná minim no akyɛ
This feels like something that should be easy.	Eyi te nka sɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I know you want some	Minim sɛ wopɛ bi
No one should ever know.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara hu da.
I think you’ll enjoy it.	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ho.
No one knew what to say.	Ná obiara nnim nea ɔbɛka.
I have been wanting to go for some time now.	Mede mepɛ sɛ mekɔ bere bi ni.
There is no time to think about it.	Bere biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
But whatever he was, he was happy.	Nanso sɛnea na ɔyɛ biara no, na n’ani gye.
Not this time around.	Ɛnyɛ saa bere yi.
I wanted to ease him into it	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ mmerɛw sɛ ɔbɛkɔ mu
One has to accept what they do.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi gye nea wɔyɛ no tom.
Quite a lot, indeed.	Ɛdɔɔso yiye, ampa.
This time has been difficult.	Saa bere yi ayɛ den.
They just are.	Wɔn kɛkɛ.
I had no idea what they were doing with the information	Ná minnim nea wɔde nsɛm no reyɛ
You never do anything else.	Wonyɛ biribi foforo biara da.
However, there had to be another way.	Nanso, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan foforo bi wɔ hɔ.
We had to work at night.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma anadwo.
The story is complicated and not what it seems.	Asɛm no mu yɛ den na ɛnyɛ nea ɛte sɛ nea ɛte no.
But you know, maybe there’s something, too.	Nanso wunim, ebia biribi wɔ hɔ, nso.
However, there have been mistakes along the way.	Nanso, mfomso ahorow aba kwan no so.
I was never very good at lying	Ná menyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw kɛse wɔ atoro mu da
I am focused on them.	Mede m’adwene asi wɔn so.
I couldn’t hear him very well	Anka mintumi nte ne nte yiye
He was at home.	Ná ɔwɔ fie.
I leaned against the door	Mede me ho too ɔpon no anim
In the meantime, you feel good.	Saa bere yi nyinaa, wo ho yɛ wo yam.
Good planning on his part.	Nhyehyɛe pa a ɔyɛ wɔ ne fam.
I just forgot his name, that’s all	Me werɛ fii ne din kɛkɛ, ɛno ara ne no
I don’t know much about them.	Minnim wɔn ho nsɛm pii.
We had space, we had plenty of space.	Ná yɛwɔ baabi, na yɛwɔ baabi pii.
We put ourselves first.	Yɛde yɛn ho di kan.
He has plans.	Ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow.
That really hit me.	Ɛno bɔɔ me ankasa.
But only for a short time.	Nanso bere tiaa bi pɛ.
But things are not entirely bad here.	Nanso nneɛma nyɛ bɔne koraa wɔ ha.
I couldn’t do anything about it	Na mintumi nyɛ ho hwee
I want the opportunity to act	Mepɛ hokwan sɛ meyɛ agoru
And you can’t have anything.	Na worentumi nnya biribiara.
I free myself every afternoon	Mede me ho awia biara
Very excited about this product.	Anigye kɛse wɔ saa ade yi ho.
I doubt we can get anything else out of him	Migye kyim sɛ yebetumi anya biribi foforo biara afi ne hɔ
I am still doing them	Meda so ara reyɛ wɔn
I know my mother was like that	Minim sɛ na me maame te saa
I just wish my mom would be my mom again	Me yam a anka me maame bɛyɛ me maame bio kɛkɛ
Make sure no one can do anything.	Hwɛ sɛ obiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ biribiara.
There was always more.	Ná pii wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
Pretending to be innocent.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ sɛ wɔn ho nni asɛm.
So many good books, so little time.	Nhoma pa pii saa, bere kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
It’s a temporary one.	Ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi.
I told you to go	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ kɔ
They made me'	Wowɔ me'.
You get it.	Wo nsa ka.
I wish he was here with me	Me yam a anka ɔne me wɔ ha
But go for it.	Nanso kɔ.
I couldn’t find enough of them to say	Na mintumi nhu wɔn mu nea ɛdɔɔso a mɛka
He has no right to do so.	Onni hokwan sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
We have my perfect children.	Yɛwɔ me mma a ɛyɛ pɛ.
However, he doesn’t.	Nanso, ɔnyɛ saa.
The man looked at her intently.	Ɔbarima no hwɛɛ no ​​denneennen.
And one more, too.	Na biako bio nso.
In your presence.	Wɔ wo nkyɛn.
And both of them, what's up, and they've both moved on ever since.	Na wɔn baanu nyinaa, dɛn na ɛyɛ, na wɔn baanu nyinaa akɔ so fi saa bere no.
Sin, in the chapter.	Bɔne, wɔ ti no mu.
I really wanted to go	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ ankasa
Do it as best you can.	Yɛ no sɛnea wubetumi biara.
This approach demonstrates the robustness of our approach.	Saa kwan yi kyerɛ sɛnea yɛn kwan no mu yɛ den.
Every case brought before us is like that.	Asɛm biara a wɔde baa yɛn anim saa na ɛte saa.
I could have gone.	Anka metumi akɔ.
I think it’s dangerous now	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ asiane mprempren
I didn't know where you were	Ná minnim baabi a wowɔ
I have to work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma.
This is a bad situation.	Eyi yɛ tebea bɔne.
I was in the front row	Ná mewɔ anim hɔ
I could look at the big picture again.	Ná metumi ahwɛ mfonini kɛse no bio.
I hadn’t thought of it that way	Ná minsusuw ho saa
I believe he was in the background.	Migye di sɛ na ɔwɔ akyi.
I think we both liked it	Misusuw sɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa ani gyee ho
I really wanted to do something with my hands.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mede me nsa yɛ biribi ankasa.
Only he could have done that.	Ɔno nkutoo na anka obetumi ayɛ saa.
I have to deal with sin more	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne bɔne bɔ kɛse
The time goes by.	Bere no kɔ.
It’s not just any idea.	Ɛnyɛ adwene biara kɛkɛ.
I can’t just let you go on your own	Mintumi mma wo ankasa nkɔ kɛkɛ
I don’t know if that program still exists.	Minnim sɛ ebia saa nhyehyɛe no da so ara wɔ hɔ anaa.
I have to do that	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa
The thought took over me.	Adwene no gyee me so.
Never leave the bed.	Mma mfi mpa no so da.
I think he’ll like it	Misusuw sɛ n’ani begye ho
He will, if he can.	Ɔbɛyɛ saa, sɛ obetumi a.
The arrangement was going quite well.	Ná nhyehyɛe no rekɔ so yiye koraa.
I felt empty, nothing ever made me happy	Metee nka sɛ me ho nni hwee, biribiara amma m’ani nnye da
I live in my apartment with my wife	Me ne me yere te me dan mu
No problem at this point.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ wɔ saa bere yi mu.
Here are two little things you can do.	Nneɛma abien a wubetumi ayɛ kakra wɔ ha.
I again had to do it for the books	Me bio na ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ma nhoma ahorow no
The only man in our group.	Ɔbarima koro pɛ a ɔwɔ yɛn kuw no mu.
Use the retrospective.	Fa nea wɔde hwɛ nneɛma a atwam no di dwuma.
There was a problem.	Ná ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
And you shouldn’t be doing that.	Na ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I wish he could see this	Me yam a anka obetumi ahu eyi
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Obviously, oral testimony was involved.	Ɛda adi sɛ, na asɛm a wɔde ano ka ka ho.
That had been easy enough.	Ná ɛno ayɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I still had absolutely no idea what to tell him.	Ná meda so ara nni nea mɛka akyerɛ no ho adwene biara koraa.
I can’t do anything.	Me ntumi nyɛ hwee.
He started with something.	Ɔde biribi fii ase.
I looked at him with my eyes	Mede m’ani hwɛɛ no
This time, it’s for the last time.	Saa bere yi de, ɛyɛ nea etwa to.
I'll be fine tomorrow.	Me ho bɛtɔ me ɔkyena.
I wanted to see his eyes	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu n’ani
This is an inexpensive product.	Eyi yɛ ade a ne bo nyɛ den.
No one said a word to him.	Obiara anka asɛm biara ankyerɛ no.
I will give the reasons below.	Mede nea enti a ɛte saa bɛma wɔ ase ha.
I think back to the day of the accident	Misusuw da a akwanhyia no sii no ho
I am very convinced	Migye di yiye
So that’s what this was about.	Enti ɛno ne nea na eyi fa ho.
Not even the name.	Ɛnyɛ din no mpo.
That’s my size.	Ɛno ne me kɛse.
People could not really rule.	Ná nkurɔfo ntumi nni tumi ankasa.
I was actually in about three things	Ná mewɔ nneɛma bɛyɛ abiɛsa mu ankasa
I immediately felt better	Ntɛm ara na me ho tɔɔ me
But it was too late for that now.	Nanso na aka akyi dodo ama saa mprempren.
I think it’s obvious	Misusuw sɛ ɛda adi sɛ ɛda adi
This is a great idea.	Eyi yɛ adwene kɛse.
We drove him to my house.	Yɛde ne kar kɔɔ me fie.
But to him, it was a lie.	Nanso wɔ ne fam no, na ɛyɛ atoro asɛm.
I want to clarify this with you	Mepɛ sɛ me ne mo ma eyi mu da hɔ
I wish everything was that easy	Me yam a anka biribiara yɛ mmerɛw saa
A few years later, he did have one	Mfe kakraa bi akyi no, na ɔwɔ bi ampa
I wasn’t being cold.	Ná ɛnyɛ awɔw na na mereyɛ.
Save me in the other story if you have a chance.	Gye me wɔ asɛm foforo no mu sɛ wowɔ hokwan a.
He may not even know about it.	Ebia na onnim ho hwee mpo.
Quite a few of them	Wɔn mu kakraa bi ankasa
He doesn’t always participate.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu.
I don’t know at all	Minnim koraa
He told you that.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ wo saa.
I feel wonderful, I understand	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa, mete ase
I have a serious problem with that	Mewɔ ɔhaw kɛse bi wɔ saa asɛm no ho
We have you now.	Yɛwɔ wo seesei.
His mind was elsewhere.	Ná n’adwene wɔ baabi foforo.
I thought my father was a good man	Ná misusuw sɛ me papa yɛ ɔbarima pa
Perhaps for him it was.	Ebia wɔ ne fam no, na ɛte saa.
But he certainly feels pain.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔte yaw.
I feel like someone is there	Mete nka sɛ obi wɔ hɔ
I admit that was a mistake	Migye tom sɛ na ɛno yɛ mfomso
A happy home.	Ofie a anigye wom.
I feel the same way.	Me nso mete nka.
And not at the door.	Na ɛnyɛ ɔpon no ano.
I don’t know if it will.	Me nnim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa anaa.
I want to know about this girl.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu abeawa yi ho nsɛm.
That made me interested	Ɛno maa m’ani gyee ho
Maybe we can actually find something.	Ebia yebetumi anya biribi ankasa.
Use.	Fa di dwuma.
If he’s good, he’s good.	Sɛ ɔyɛ papa a, ɔyɛ papa.
I don’t really like that.	M’ani nnye ho saa ankasa.
I am big enough, strong enough.	Meyɛ kɛse sɛnea ɛsɛ, me ho yɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I had no idea how difficult it would be	Ná minnim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ den no
They don’t seem to care.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm.
It’s what he does.	Ɛyɛ nea ɔyɛ.
First, it is infrastructure.	Nea edi kan no, ɛyɛ nneɛma a wɔde yɛ adwuma.
It’s okay to make mistakes.	Ɛnyɛ hwee sɛ wobɛyɛ mfomso.
I put you both in the same bed.	Mede mo baanu nyinaa too mpa koro mu.
It really is that for me.	Ɛyɛ saa ankasa ma me.
There was just something in my eyes	Ná biribi wɔ m’ani so ara kwa
I’m so happy for you both	M’ani agye paa ma mo baanu nyinaa
We may actually be behind all this.	Ebia yɛwɔ eyi nyinaa akyi ankasa.
Many people.	Nnipa pii.
I felt that all those years, but not anymore	Metee nka saa mfe no nyinaa, nanso ɛnyɛ saa bio
He did a good job.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma pa.
It was a pleasure.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye.
Everything seemed so clear.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara mu da hɔ yiye.
I was not in the room.	Ná minni dan no mu.
He was awesome too.	Ná ɔno nso yɛ hu.
He put his hand on the doorknob.	Ɔde ne nsa too ɔpon no ano so.
Thank you so much.	Meda wo ase pa ara.
And you know what, it’s good.	Na wunim nea, ɛyɛ papa.
Not a man.	Ɛnyɛ ɔbarima bi.
It was my last day.	Ná ɛyɛ me da a etwa to.
There is nothing else here.	Biribi foforo biara nni ha.
I really enjoyed it	M’ani gyee ho ankasa
I wanted to see what he looked like	Ná mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ sɛnea ɔte
I saw a town there	Mihuu kurow bi wɔ hɔ
People are very nice.	Nkurɔfo ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I have to keep mentioning his name	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so bɔ ne din
It was a measure.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho.
I include them in there as well	Mede wɔn ka ho wɔ hɔ nso
I believe we have a long road ahead of us	Migye di sɛ yɛwɔ ɔkwan tenten bi a ɛda yɛn anim
He would bring it.	Ná ɔde bɛba.
I feel kind of surprised	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ me nwonwa wɔ ɔkwan bi so
The money seemed unreal.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea sika no nyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
I didn’t want the season to end	Ná mempɛ sɛ bere no bɛba awiei
Everything is done the right way.	Wɔyɛ biribiara ɔkwan pa so.
I couldn’t help myself	Na mintumi nyɛ me ho hwee
On their own.	Wɔ wɔn ankasa so.
I always look at people	Mehwɛ nkurɔfo bere nyinaa
Tell me about it again.	Ka ho asɛm bio kyerɛ me.
It’s not that much.	Ɛnyɛ pii saa.
Most don’t, and that’s what they rely on.	Dodow no ara ntumi nyɛ saa, na ɛno ne nea wɔde wɔn ho to so.
I can't believe you even think about it	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ wususuw ho mpo
I think he can make you happy	Misusuw sɛ obetumi ama w’ani agye
The group is incredibly strong mentally.	Kuw no yɛ den wɔ adwene mu ma ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I have to get to work early	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ adwuma ntɛm
If you want to.	Sɛ wopɛ a.
I already know all this	Minim eyi nyinaa dedaw
I am with you all that time, except then	Me ne wo wɔ hɔ saa bere no nyinaa, gye saa bere no
It was terrible, like a prison.	Ná ɛyɛ hu, te sɛ afiase.
And, on to the words.	Na, kɔ nsɛm no so.
And there are things we can do.	Na nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ.
And it has certainly been amazing.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ayɛ nwonwa.
What a boy he is.	Abarimaa bɛn ara ni.
We can try to do that.	Yebetumi abɔ mmɔden sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa.
Maybe even as long as a week.	Ebia mpo tenten te sɛ dapɛn biako.
I have children.	Mewɔ mmofra.
We have a lot of clothes.	Yɛwɔ ntade pii.
I gave him the groceries	Mede nneɛma a wɔde bɛtɔ nneɛma no maa no
He was such a wonderful dog.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔkraman a ɔyɛ nwonwa saa.
If this is true.	Sɛ eyi yɛ nokware a.
This idea is amazing.	Saa adwene yi yɛ nwonwa.
But it is wrong to say that it does nothing to deal with them.	Nanso ɛyɛ mfomso sɛ wobɛka sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee mfa nni wɔn ho dwuma.
I didn’t think much of it at the time	Saa bere no na minsusuw ho pii
I’m very excited about it.	M’ani agye ho yiye.
I wanted him to understand	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔte ase
So it will be good.	Enti ɛbɛyɛ papa.
This is my house.	Eyi me fie.
Word is a powerful force	Asɛm yɛ ade a tumi wom
He has resources.	Ɔwɔ nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma.
I can barely see you	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nhu wo
It’s not pretty.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
They are so good.	Wɔyɛ papa saa.
I found a way.	Mihuu ɔkwan bi so.
Maybe he should have done that.	Ebia na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
That doesn’t matter at all.	Ɛno ho nhia koraa.
I will take it into you.	Mede bɛkɔ wo mu.
Something else came into the picture	Ade foforo bi baa mfonini no mu
I had a job to do	Ná mewɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ
I have plenty of time yet	Mewɔ bere pii de besi nnɛ
I don’t think it’s that they don’t care.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛyɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ wɔn asɛm.
I just thought you could use a little extra	Misusuwii ara ne sɛ wubetumi de aka ho kakra adi dwuma
At least I should know	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ mihu
It was his song.	Ná ɛyɛ ne dwom.
He was on the road to something now.	Ná ɔwɔ biribi kwan so mprempren.
Maybe it’s not.	Ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
Not the way you like it.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea w’ani gye ho no.
Nor is it the case.	Saa ara nso na ɛnte saa.
It’s my right.	Ɛyɛ me hokwan.
Not what you think.	Ɛnyɛ nea wususuw.
By then it was too late.	Saa bere no na aka akyi dodo.
Do something about it.	Yɛ ho biribi.
But consider the products.	Nanso susuw nneɛma a wɔyɛ no ho.
I just want to take you to dinner.	Mepɛ sɛ mede wo kɔ anwummere aduan ara kwa.
Being.	Reyɛ.
I couldn’t do that	Ná mintumi nyɛ saa
Which, in itself, is a terrible plan.	Nea, ɛno ankasa, yɛ nhyehyɛe a ɛyɛ hu.
Where things start.	Baabi a nneɛma fi ase.
Right now and now.	Mprempren ne mprempren ara.
I will do it for the rest of my life.	Mɛyɛ no me nkwa nna nyinaa.
I understand it all too well	Mete ne nyinaa ase yiye dodo
But he had another exciting accomplishment.	Nanso na ɔwɔ ade foforo a ɛyɛ anigye a wayɛ.
Maybe no one is there.	Ebia obiara nni hɔ.
I do want to talk about us	Mepɛ sɛ meka yɛn ho asɛm ampa
I have to take care of them	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ wɔn
It doesn’t understand, but it’s not alive.	Ɛnte ase, nanso ɛnyɛ nkwa mu.
It is not realistic by any means.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware ɔkwan biara so.
I want to apologize to both of you	Mepɛ sɛ mepa mo baanu nyinaa kyɛw
We hope to do so.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa.
I couldn’t eat solid food for a week.	Ná mintumi nni aduan a ɛyɛ den dapɛn biako.
You are the best.	Wo na woyɛ papa sen biara.
He was great though.	Ɔyɛɛ kɛse nanso.
I am so sorry about all that	Ɛyɛ me yaw paa wɔ saa nneɛma no nyinaa ho
He may have parked a car.	Ebia na ɔde kar asi hɔ.
Too fast to do anything.	Ntɛmntɛm dodo sɛ wobɛyɛ biribi.
Without your help, I cannot do my part	Sɛ mo mmoa nka ho a, mintumi nyɛ me fam de
I know you all have done a great job	Minim sɛ mo nyinaa ayɛ adwuma kɛse
This is not the case.	Eyi nyɛ saa.
I know what play means to you	Minim nea agoru kyerɛ ma wo
I was still doing well.	Ná meda so ara reyɛ yiye.
The people were too fond of him.	Ná nkurɔfo no ani gye ne ho dodo.
I didn’t know what to do with it	Ná minnim nea mede bɛyɛ
That is no longer true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware bio.
I need to know what he looks like	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea ɔte
I also really like my lovely old house	M’ani gye me fie dedaw a ɛyɛ fɛ no nso ho yiye
I want to talk to him for the first time	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa nea edi kan
They are beautiful too.	Wɔn nso ho yɛ fɛ.
I moved from one era to the next	Mede me ho fii bere koro mu kɔɔ bere foforo mu
And that doesn’t matter either.	Na ɛno nso nyɛ hwee.
He’s the one who made things.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ nneɛma.
The strange people were always a favorite of mine.	Ná nnipa a wɔyɛ nwonwa no yɛ ade a m’ani gye ho bere nyinaa.
I can’t tell you how good that made me feel	Mintumi nka sɛnea ɛno maa me ho tɔɔ me no nkyerɛ wo
I can’t even go to the door with him	Mintumi ne no nkɔ ɔpon no ano mpo
And it was just awesome.	Na na ɛyɛ hu ara kwa.
I don’t think that’s true	Minsusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware
I am completely involved.	Mede me ho ahyɛ mu koraa.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ade bɔne.
But no one is doing that.	Nanso obiara nni hɔ a ɔreyɛ saa.
This was not really the point.	Ná ɛnyɛ eyi ne asɛm no ankasa.
And maybe it even looks like it.	Na ebia mpo ɛte sɛ nea ɛte.
And it really wasn’t.	Na ɛnyɛ saa ankasa.
I could work with this	Ná metumi de eyi ayɛ adwuma
I can’t take him home	Mintumi mfa no nkɔ fie
I can’t save you from that	Mintumi nnye wo mfi saa asɛm no mu
Just keep yourself hydrated.	Ma wo ho nsu kɛkɛ.
Think about this.	Susuw eyi ho hwɛ.
I think he knows that	Misusuw sɛ onim saa
I could do something	Ná metumi ayɛ biribi
I think about it like everyone else does	Misusuw ho te sɛ nea obiara yɛ no
It looks so hot.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hyew kɛse.
There is no one else.	Obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
She would have been a beautiful girl.	Anka ɔbɛyɛ abeawa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
The rest of his time was successful	Ne bere a aka no dii yiye
At least not for you and me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ me ne wo de.
I have already started mine	Mede me de no afi ase dedaw
If you doubt its power, trust me.	Sɛ wugye ne tumi ho kyim a, gye me di.
I’m very excited and brought something new here	M’ani agye yiye na mede ade foforo baa ha
I couldn’t help him much	Na mintumi mmoa no pii
And that little bit is nothing.	Na saa kakra no nyɛ hwee.
All I could hope for was that he was with them.	Nea na mewɔ anidaso ara ne sɛ ɔka wɔn ho.
I really liked the look of it	M’ani gyee sɛnea ɛte no ho ankasa
Later he played with them.	Akyiri yi ɔne wɔn dii agoru.
I moved to the door	Mede me ho kɔɔ ɔpon no ano
We were a group.	Ná yɛyɛ kuw bi.
This is the no.	Eyi ne no.
I look forward to it every night.	Mehwɛ kwan anadwo biara.
I was the only man there	Ná me nkutoo ne ɔbarima a ɔwɔ hɔ
Repeat if necessary.	Sɛ ɛho hia a, san yɛ saa.
I think that would be ideal	Misusuw sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara
That was something else.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade foforo.
I was in trouble enough.	Ná mewɔ ɔhaw mu sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I absolutely want to make sure.	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ hu koraa.
I’m just thinking about them.	M’adwene wɔ wɔn ho ara kwa.
Heat it up.	Fa yɛ hyew.
Everything is important.	Biribiara yɛ nea ɛho hia.
But that’s something we can’t help you with.	Nanso ɛno yɛ biribi a yɛrentumi mmoa wo.
And it’s not like that now.	Na ɛnyɛ saa mprempren.
I want to understand your grand plan	Mepɛ sɛ mete wo nhyehyɛe kɛse no ase
I agree with you that it was.	Me ne wo yɛ adwene sɛ na ɛte saa.
I just want to take her home	Nea mepɛ ara ne sɛ mede no bɛkɔ fie
I wonder where he is now	Misusuw baabi a ɔwɔ mprempren ho
Tell us the number, time and date.	Ka dodow, bere ne da no kyerɛ yɛn.
He knew where it was.	Ná onim baabi a ɛwɔ.
Keep going and keep going.	Kɔ so nkɔ so.
Few are free.	Kakraa na wɔde ma kwa.
I’m not sure if I’m going to be interested.	Me deɛ, m’ani begye ho anaa.
Just watch this unfold.	Hwɛ sɛnea eyi rekɔ so ara kwa.
It all came to me.	Ne nyinaa baa me nkyɛn.
And he had one, too.	Na ɔno nso na ɔwɔ bi.
Beware of fluent speakers.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ wɔn a wɔka kasa yiye no ho.
It’s a big part of the problem.	Ɛyɛ ɔhaw no fã kɛse.
And I don’t think anyone would do that for anyone	Na minsusuw sɛ obiara bɛyɛ saa ama obi
He had to be brought in quickly.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde no ba ntɛmntɛm.
Such a move can be a serious mistake.	Tu a obi tu a ɛte saa no betumi ayɛ mfomso kɛse.
I was more shocked than anyone	Me ho dwiriw me sen obiara
No one said a word.	Obiara anka asɛm biara.
They say one thing and do another.	Wɔka asɛm biako na wɔyɛ foforo nso.
It’s hard to do.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ.
At the time I didn’t know	Saa bere no na minnim
Return to the main room.	San kɔ dan kɛse no mu.
I didn’t want them to	Ná mempɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa
I don't really know what to do.	Minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ankasa.
It hurts really bad.	Ɛyɛ yaw ankasa bɔne.
I can’t do anything about him	Mintumi nyɛ ne ho hwee
And yet it was there.	Na nanso na ɛwɔ hɔ.
It’s a wonderful story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
And I had to do that.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
I really want to be good	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ papa ankasa
We have that in my house.	Yɛwɔ saa wɔ me fie.
I did everything yesterday and today	Meyɛɛ biribiara nnɛra ne nnɛ
It never works.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma da.
It’s not your truth.	Ɛnyɛ wo nokware.
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a mɛyɛ ɔkyena
I don’t have to look into it	Ɛnsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu
I knew then.	Ná minim saa bere no.
This time, I can’t do that.	Saa bere yi de, mintumi nyɛ saa.
He put it all down.	Ɔde ne nyinaa too hɔ.
Not that I’m not included.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ me nka ho.
It all went well.	Ne nyinaa kɔɔ so yiye.
I know you like him and he likes you	Minim sɛ w’ani gye ne ho na ɔno nso ani gye wo ho
You have to do something with it.	Wo deɛ, ɛsɛ sɛ wode yɛ biribi.
My son.	Me ba.
You got the job, so far.	Wo nsa kaa adwuma no, de besi ha.
But not with you, or, not with you at all.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wo nkyɛn, anaasɛ, ɛnyɛ wo koraa.
I had to work that day and that night	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma saa da no ne saa anadwo no
But someone or something has to control the money supply.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ obi anaa biribi di sika a ɛwɔ hɔ no so.
Whatever you really want.	Nea wopɛ biara ankasa.
I was redeemed by the past	Wɔde nneɛma a atwam no gyee me
In the end, it didn’t matter.	Awiei koraa no, na ɛnyɛ hwee.
I saw what was going on	Mihuu nea ɛrekɔ so no
I can’t say exactly what it is	Mintumi nka nea ɛyɛ ankasa
Otherwise it’s playful and fun.	Anyɛ saa a ɛyɛ agoru ne anigye.
I did it all, and people loved it	Meyɛɛ ne nyinaa, na nkurɔfo ani gyee ho
This is also true.	Eyi nso yɛ nokware.
I didn’t want that at all.	Na mempɛ saa koraa.
I wonder if it works	Misusuw sɛ ebia ɛyɛ adwuma anaa
That brings the job for a lot of people.	Ɛno de adwuma no ba ma nnipa pii.
I’m in love with him.	M’ani gye ne ho.
I can't tell you anything else	Mintumi nka biribi foforo biara nkyerɛ wo
The paper issue is irrelevant.	Krataa asɛm no ho nhia.
I was alone with myself	Ná me nkutoo na me ne me ho wɔ hɔ
You shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
This thing is terrible.	Saa ade yi yɛ hu.
I couldn’t see it from down here	Na mintumi nhu no mfi ha ase
I want to use him to reach out to them.	Mepɛ sɛ mede no di dwuma de kɔ wɔn nkyɛn.
It wasn’t my style	Ná ɛnyɛ me su
They must be	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ .
Not too good, either.	Ɛnyɛ papa dodo, nso.
I know this guy.	Minim saa ɔbarima yi.
He could have been of any age, from any background.	Anka obetumi adi mfe biara, afi tebea biara mu.
He was recently introduced.	Nnansa yi ara na wɔde no kyerɛɛ no.
I love leftovers.	M’ani gye aduan a aka ho.
He was obviously interested.	Ɛda adi sɛ na n’ani agye ho.
I don’t live with half a man.	Ɛnyɛ ɔbarima fã na me ne no nte.
But this cannot be the whole story.	Nanso eyi ntumi nyɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
There is no need to do so.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
There was nothing I could do.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a metumi ayɛ.
I think he has a crush on me	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ me ho anigye
A real man can show that he is really involved	Ɔbarima ankasa betumi akyerɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho ahyɛ mu ankasa
Infrastructure is one reason.	Nneɛma a wɔde yɛ adwuma yɛ ade biako nti a ɛte saa.
I think this was a bad idea	Misusuw sɛ na eyi yɛ adwene bɔne
He thinks he knows everything.	Osusuw sɛ onim biribiara.
But he knows everything about sex.	Nanso onim nna ho biribiara.
And you have the right to do so.	Na wowɔ hokwan sɛ woyɛ saa.
Or very little, very little.	Anaasɛ kakraa bi pɛ, kakraa bi pɛ.
I watched him every time he acted	Ná mehwɛ no bere biara a ɔreyɛ ade no
I think you will do a wonderful thing	Misusuw sɛ wobɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa
Whenever someone goes down.	Bere biara a obi bɛkɔ fam no.
I have a book to give you	Mewɔ nhoma bi a mede bɛma wo
A girl called his name	Abeawa bi bɔɔ ne din
I had to take care of him too	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ no nso
I felt helpless and hopeless	Metee nka sɛ mintumi nyɛ hwee na minni anidaso
I don't know if it's used now	Minnim sɛ wɔde di dwuma mprempren
Or rather, they should.	Anaasɛ, ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
It’s going on there.	Ɛrekɔ so wɔ hɔ.
I even arranged an accident for my mother	Meyɛɛ akwanhyia ho nhyehyɛe mpo maa me maame
He would become characters in the books.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm wɔ nhoma ahorow no mu.
I should have said he already has	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ ɔwɔ bi dedaw
My father was one of them.	Ná me papa yɛ wɔn mu biako.
Or too much of me.	Anaasɛ me ho dodo.
I just want something simple	Mepɛ biribi a ɛnyɛ den kɛkɛ
However, it doesn’t seem to work.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ adwuma.
However, it certainly didn’t feel like it.	Nanso, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛnte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
I already knew what was going down	Ná minim nea ɛrekɔ fam dedaw
It’s fun, but it’s hard.	Ɛyɛ anigye, nanso ɛyɛ den.
I didn’t think it would be that hard	Na minsusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ den saa
He is the son of his mother.	Ɔyɛ ne maame ba.
There is only one thing that does not work.	Ade biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I should like this one	Ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani gye eyi ho
It was really bad for me.	Ná ɛyɛ bɔne kɛse ma me ankasa.
It’s the book that matters.	Ɛyɛ nhoma no na ɛho hia.
But he wasn’t interested.	Nanso na n’ani nnye ho.
Not surprising, really.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa, ampa.
Music was never what he thought it was.	Nnwom nyɛ nea na osusuw sɛ ɛte no da.
I'm pretty good, you know	Me ho yɛ fɛ yiye, wunim
It does and it doesn’t.	Ɛyɛ na ɛnyɛ saa.
We do this all the time.	Yɛyɛ eyi bere nyinaa.
He doesn't do that	Ɔnyɛ saa .
A little bit is left.	Kakraa bi na aka.
So I saw the faces	Enti mihuu anim ahorow no
This seems to surprise them.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi ho dwiriw wɔn.
I stepped into the gun barrel	Mede me nan sii tuo a wɔde ahyɛ mu no mu
This terrible incident was no accident.	Saa asɛm a ɛyɛ hu yi anyɛ akwanhyia.
He did the same thing, too.	Ɔno nso yɛɛ saa ara.
That took almost a month.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno gyee ɔsram biako.
But man, those words were awesome.	Nanso onipa, na saa nsɛm no yɛ hu.
I wanted to go to school	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ sukuu
I think it’s the same for him	Misusuw sɛ ɛte saa ara ma ɔno nso
Put one on.	Fa biako hyɛ.
They just work so well.	Wɔyɛ adwuma yiye ara kwa.
He shakes his head hard.	Ɔbɔ ne ti denneennen.
I have to say mom and dad now	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ maame ne papa mprempren
I can’t go there anymore	Mintumi nkɔ hɔ bio
I liked this guy.	M’ani gyee ɔbarima yi ho.
You should never have even known this.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ wuhu eyi mpo da.
A few cars here and there	Kar kakraa bi a ɛwɔ ha ne ha
If so, you just acted with him according to	Sɛ saa a, na wo ne no yɛɛ ade ara kwa sɛnea .
He leaned against the table.	Ɔde ne ho too pon no so.
He's a you know what.	Ɔyɛ obi a wunim nea.
It’s not like me.	Ɛnte sɛ me.
No one talks about this.	Obiara nka eyi ho asɛm.
This can be caused by many factors.	Eyi betumi afi nneɛma pii mu aba.
Maybe I can do that.	Ebia metumi ayɛ saa.
I know what he did to you too	Minim nea ɔyɛɛ wo nso
I wanted to agree with him	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne no yɛ adwene
It’s important.	Ɛho hia.
I hope you can save her	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi agye no nkwa
I reach further every time	Mede me nsa kɔ akyiri bere biara
I want to do this for you	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi ma mo
I have to live with them	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wɔn tra
I need to talk to them too	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wɔn nso kasa
His feet are no longer his feet.	Ne nan nyɛ ne nan bio.
I couldn’t work on him	Na mintumi nyɛ ne ho adwuma
We could never have been friends.	Anka yɛrentumi nyɛ nnamfo da.
It will be good for us.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa ama yɛn.
I put the matter at the door	Mede asɛm no too ɔpon no ano
The important thing is this.	Ade a ɛho hia ne eyi.
I squinted at him	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ ne ho
It will be better this way.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa wɔ saa kwan yi so.
Making beds, not so much.	Mpa a wɔyɛ, ɛnyɛ pii saa.
I can come home every night to you	Metumi aba fie anadwo biara aba wo nkyɛn
An old man.	Ɔbarima dedaw bi.
The story is intense but strategic.	Asɛm no mu yɛ den nanso ɛyɛ ɔkwan pa so.
Show him the money.	Fa sika no kyerɛ no.
I can handle it well	Metumi adi so yiye
Once, at my feet.	Bere bi, wɔ me nan ase.
I am lucky to be alive	Mewɔ anigye sɛ mewɔ nkwa mu
The same goes for the rear passenger car.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ kar a ɔte akyi no fam.
It’s really quite beautiful here.	Ɛyɛ fɛ koraa ankasa wɔ ha.
I think it was my favorite thing he has ever painted	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ ade a m’ani gye ho kɛse a wayɛ ho mfonini pɛn
He didn’t want them.	Ná ɔmpɛ wɔn.
I think that needs some work.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno hia adwuma bi.
This view is common and widely accepted.	Saa adwene yi abu so na nnipa pii gye tom.
I want him to like me	Mepɛ sɛ n’ani gye me ho
But with the nature of it.	Nanso ne sɛnea ɛte.
We had our hands full.	Ná yɛn nsa ayɛ ma.
I have to tell you the same.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka saa ara kyerɛ wo.
I laid her firmly on the bed	Mede no too mpa no so denneennen
I locked myself in my room for three days.	Mede me ho too me dan mu nnansa.
I just heard the words	Metee nsɛm no ara kwa
I had to find out what he wanted	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea ɔpɛ
How to hold a meeting.	Sɛnea wɔyɛ nhyiam.
It’s just how old people are.	Ɛyɛ mfe dodow a nnipa adi ara kwa.
I took good care of everything	Ná mehwɛ biribiara so yiye
Animals return to the present moment.	Mmoa san kɔ mprempren bere yi mu.
I love working with you	M’ani gye ho sɛ me ne wo bɛyɛ adwuma
I know that immediately	Minim saa ntɛm ara
I was not strong in any way	Ná me ho nyɛ den ɔkwan biara so
It’s old, but it will get better.	Ɛyɛ dedaw, nanso ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
I had to feel his presence	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mete nka sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ
I saw it recently	Mihuu no nnansa yi ara
There are some things you can do.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
He was very playful.	Ná ɔyɛ agoru paa.
I was so young and he was so perfect	Ná meyɛ abofra paa na na ɔyɛ pɛ paa
I know you will all do it for our people	Minim sɛ mo nyinaa bɛyɛ ama yɛn nkurɔfo
I couldn’t think of anyone living there.	Ná mintumi nsusuw obiara a ɔte hɔ ho.
That would be terrible.	Ɛno bɛyɛ hu.
I have my preferences too, you know	Me nso mewɔ nneɛma a mepɛ, wunim
This is a great project to do with your kids too.	Eyi yɛ adwuma kɛse a wo ne wo mma nso bɛyɛ.
It didn't look pretty.	Ná ɛnte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
The water was real.	Ná nsu no yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
I wasn't really sure	Ná minnim yiye ankasa
I’m so glad you’re here with me	M’ani agye paa sɛ wo ne me wɔ ha
So take this.	Enti fa eyi.
I can get the money, no problem.	Metumi anya sika no, ɔhaw biara nni ho.
I am new to this.	Meyɛ foforo wɔ eyi mu.
Prices can be wrong.	Nneɛma bo a ɛwɔ hɔ no betumi ayɛ mfomso.
He says it works well, though.	Ɔka sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma yiye, nanso.
I recently heard this story	Nnansa yi ara na metee saa asɛm yi
Nothing like that was necessary.	Ná biribi a ɛte saa ho nhia.
I just never really had one	Na minni bi ankasa da kɛkɛ
I see it in his eyes	Mihu wɔ n’ani so
Something has to be done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi.
I want that too.	Me nso mepɛ saa.
I couldn’t understand it.	Ná mintumi nte ase.
He was doing that.	Ná ɔyɛ saa.
I have to be very careful	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye paa
He knew the city.	Ná onim kurow no.
I enjoyed everything we did	M’ani gyee biribiara a yɛyɛ ho
They were very happy.	Ná wɔn ani gye paa.
I wanted him to take me back to him	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔde me san kɔ ne nkyɛn
Three days have passed.	Nnansa na atwam.
But no one says that.	Nanso obiara nka saa.
Tell them what you are doing before you do it.	Ka nea woreyɛ no kyerɛ wɔn ansa na woayɛ.
This seems crucial to the problem.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi ho hia kɛse wɔ ɔhaw no ho.
I guess it’s not that surprising	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ nwonwa saa
It was starting to really hurt.	Na afi ase reyɛ yaw ankasa.
I didn’t know that	Ná minnim saa asɛm no
I only saw him a few times	Mihuu no mpɛn kakraa bi pɛ
I was anything but, really	Na meyɛ biribiara nanso, ampa
That was when he was a kid.	Ɛno ne bere a na ɔyɛ abofra no.
I knew he was something.	Ná minim sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
I was pretty sure there were only two	Ná migye di yiye sɛ abien pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ
I know him.	Minim no.
This is a big deal for him.	Eyi yɛ asɛm kɛse ma no.
There was barely even enough water for them.	Ná ɛkame ayɛ sɛ nsu a ɛdɔɔso mpo nni hɔ mma wɔn.
We had a plan.	Ná yɛwɔ nhyehyɛe bi.
That is how the problem began.	Saa na ɔhaw no fii ase.
A man should do what a man should do.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbarima yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbarima yɛ.
I have time.	Mewɔ bere.
He is weak.	Ɔyɛ mmerɛw.
Maybe that’s a mistake.	Ebia ɛno yɛ mfomso.
He just made a mistake.	Ɔyɛɛ mfomso ara kwa.
It’s not a big deal.	Ɛnyɛ ade kɛse.
I know all about sex, you know	Minim nna ho nsɛm nyinaa, wunim
He's doing well.	Ɔreyɛ yiye.
It sounded like you really wanted it.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wopɛ ankasa.
I felt so drained.	Metee nka sɛ me ho ayɛ me hyew kɛse.
A handsome man stepped out and nodded	Ɔbarima bi a ne ho yɛ fɛ fii adi na ɔde ne ti too fam
However, there are a few problems with this.	Nanso, ɔhaw kakraa bi wɔ eyi ho.
I had never forgotten	Ná me werɛ mfi da
I was a different person.	Ná meyɛ onipa foforo.
Maybe he doesn’t have one.	Ebia na onni bi.
He worked on at least one project with his wife.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɔne ne yere yɛɛ adwuma biako.
Shortly thereafter, he did the same.	Ɛno akyi bere tiaa bi no, ɔyɛɛ saa ara.
I truly believe that.	Migye di saa ampa.
It may be a mistake.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ mfomso.
I tell the story in such a way	Meka asɛm no wɔ ɔkwan a ɛte saa so
Hope you can use that.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi de saa adi dwuma.
It was still quite early.	Ná ɛda so ara yɛ ntɛm koraa.
We have been home alone all evening.	Yɛn nkutoo akɔ fie anwummere no nyinaa.
Things have to be done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nneɛma.
I heard it a lot lately	Metee no pii nnansa yi
His wife is here with him.	Ne yere ka ne ho wɔ ha.
I definitely wanted it to be the end	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ awiei
He had no rights over her.	Ná onni hokwan biara wɔ ne so.
I brought it to myself	Mede baa me ho so
The first day of the.	Da a edi kan no.
I really want another one	Mepɛ foforo ankasa
I have nowhere to go but home	Minni baabi a mɛkɔ gye fie
I loved that about them	M’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho wɔ wɔn ho
Not from my mother.	Ɛnyɛ me maame hɔ.
I felt very clear.	Metee nka sɛ me mu da hɔ yiye.
I’m interested in stories.	M’ani gye nsɛm ho.
I had no idea you could do this.	Ná minni adwene biara sɛ wubetumi ayɛ eyi.
I knew him personally from our short time together	Ná minim no ankasa fi bere tiaa a yɛde bɔɔ mu no mu
So be careful.	Enti hwɛ yiye.
I have to think of them as food	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw wɔn ho sɛ aduan
I should have known better at first glance	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu yiye wɔ m’ani a edi kan no mu
About the situation with her children.	Wɔ tebea a ɔne ne mma wom no ho.
I had to take good care of them	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ wɔn yiye
I felt pretty bad about it too	Me nso metee nka bɔne kɛse wɔ ho
I want to work.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma.
It was a difficult target	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ den sɛ wɔde wɔn ani besi so
I was the new kid almost every year	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na meyɛ abofra foforo no afe biara
I thought he was happy.	Misusuwii sɛ n’ani agye.
I felt so bad and almost unbelievable	Metee nka bɔne kɛse na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nnye nni
I find that strange	Mihu sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa
It’s not a new problem.	Ɛnyɛ ɔhaw foforo.
Remember, you are doing a job.	Kae sɛ woreyɛ adwuma bi.
However, it is now very difficult.	Nanso, mprempren ɛyɛ den yiye.
Just wrong for me.	Mfomso ara kwa ma me.
You're with him.	Woka ne ho.
I do it on the field before every game	Meyɛ no wɔ abɔnten so ansa na agoru biara aba
I just can’t quite say it	Mintumi nka no yiye kɛkɛ
But it’s not his.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɔno de.
He didn’t like that.	Ná n’ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
I just knew someone was watching me	Ná minim ara kwa sɛ obi ahwɛ me
He would tell them the same thing he told me.	Ná ɔbɛka asɛm koro no ara a ɔka kyerɛɛ me no akyerɛ wɔn.
I feel like that doesn’t matter	Mete nka sɛ ɛno ho nhia
That’s me for the day.	Ɛno ne me ma da no.
However, these things are not the same for everyone.	Nanso, saa nneɛma yi nyɛ ade koro mma obiara.
These stories would come and go.	Ná saa nsɛm yi bɛba na akɔ.
Here’s what you can do .	Nea wubetumi ayɛ ni .
This may be too soon.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ ntɛm dodo.
I didn’t know what to say at the meeting	Ná minnim nea mɛka wɔ nhyiam no ase
Good.	Papa.
Just say when and where.	Ka bere ne baabi a wobɛka kɛkɛ.
If so, do something about it.	Sɛ saa a, yɛ biribi.
I need to do a few things	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nneɛma kakraa bi
The house had told me so, too.	Na ofie no aka akyerɛ me saa, nso.
I could play too	Ná me nso metumi adi agoru
As far as I know.	Sɛnea minim no.
This is a new concept for me.	Eyi yɛ adwene foforo ma me.
I don’t know his name	Minnim ne din
Not a terrible idea on paper.	Ɛnyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ hu a ɛwɔ krataa so.
Just think about it for a moment.	Susuw so kakra kɛkɛ.
How to do it ?.	Sɛnea wɔyɛ no ?.
I feel your eyes on me	Mete nka sɛ w’ani wɔ me so
This may be the case for you too.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ saa wɔ wo nso fam.
I didn't want to talk about this	Ná mempɛ sɛ meka eyi ho asɛm
I guess it really didn’t matter	Misusuw sɛ na ɛnyɛ hwee ankasa
I couldn’t do much.	Na mintumi nyɛ pii.
If not, it should be.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
Everything should be simple, easy, simple.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribiara yɛ mmerɛw, ɛnyɛ den, ɛnyɛ den.
I had to bring him inside	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede no ba mu
But it was only temporary.	Nanso na ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi pɛ.
I thought it wasn’t.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛnte saa.
I think their in good hands	Misusuw sɛ wɔn wɔ nsa pa mu
The appeal is the simplicity.	Nea ɛyɛ anigye ne sɛnea ɛyɛ mmerɛw no.
A long time ago, a powerful person lived here	Bere tenten a atwam ni no, na obi a ɔwɔ tumi te ha
I'll get the whole story, trust me.	Me nsa bɛka asɛm no nyinaa, gye me di.
This time, he no longer cared.	Saa bere yi de, na ɛnyɛ no asɛm bio.
So they have to work towards it.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma de kɔ anim.
Even the man next to her.	Ɔbarima a ɔwɔ ne nkyɛn no mpo.
That is not the situation here.	Ɛnyɛ saa na tebea no te wɔ ha.
I didn’t want to risk your life either	Na mempɛ sɛ mede wo nkwa nso to asiane mu
I have done some work on this.	Mayɛ eyi ho adwuma bi.
I thought everything would be fine	Misusuwii sɛ biribiara bɛyɛ papa
And it’s not just mine.	Na ɛnyɛ me de nkutoo.
I'll give it a shot	Mede bɛma no tuo
I thought he felt the same way	Misusuwii sɛ ɔno nso te nka saa ara
I think he is wrong.	Misusuw sɛ odi mfomso.
I know how hard you both can be	Minim sɛnea mo baanu nyinaa betumi ayɛ den
I’m very impressed with him.	M’ani gye ne ho kɛse.
I can't work this out	Mintumi nyɛ eyi ho adwuma
I'm so worried about you	Wo ho haw me paa
That is not always the case.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛte saa.
I could think of no other story	Ná mintumi nsusuw asɛm foforo biara ho
This had nothing to do with him.	Ná eyi ne no nni hwee yɛ.
We are happy when everything is going well for us.	Yɛn ani gye bere a biribiara rekɔ yiye ama yɛn no.
I look good in this dress	Me ho yɛ fɛ wɔ saa atade yi mu
I really want him to be a good guy	Mepɛ paa sɛ ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa
I couldn’t believe he wanted me	Na mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɔpɛ me
You and no one else.	Wo na ɛnyɛ obi foforo biara.
I wanted it all to go away	Ná mepɛ sɛ ne nyinaa kɔ
Which is good for the dog.	Nea eye ma ɔkraman no.
His real name is.	Ne din ankasa ne.
I knew he shouldn't have trusted her	Ná minim sɛ anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho to no so
I really enjoyed the last part of the book	M’ani gyee nhoma no fã a etwa to no ho yiye
It didn’t seem to matter much.	Ɛte sɛ nea na ɛho nhia pii.
I really didn’t know that	Ankasa na minnim saa
He knew about her.	Ná onim ne ho asɛm.
I knew the man.	Ná minim ɔbarima no.
However, he never had enough money.	Nanso, na onni sika a ɛdɔɔso da.
I feel like I need to add something	Mete nka sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ mede biribi ka ho
This is the test.	Eyi ne sɔhwɛ no.
All in all, we were first class.	Ne nyinaa mu no, na yɛyɛ ade a edi kan.
I told him that it was beautiful	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ yiye
He asked and it was too good.	Ebia na eye dodo.
If he could do it.	Sɛ na obetumi ayɛ.
I believe this falls under consumption	Migye di sɛ eyi hyɛ nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma ase
First, the narrative is often too simple.	Nea edi kan no, asɛm a wɔka no taa yɛ mmerɛw dodo.
He knew better than to say anything.	Ná onim yiye sen sɛ ɔbɛka biribiara.
I think he’s a little young	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛ abofra kakra
He's just fantastic.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
I was still afraid of the unknown	Ná meda so ara suro nea minnim no
It has to be something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ biribi.
It has to be real.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
One can only hope.	Obi betumi anya anidaso nkutoo.
There is no life at all.	Nkwa nnim koraa.
I can take care of myself	Metumi ahwɛ me ho
The way you do it.	Sɛnea woyɛ no.
We were no longer alone.	Ná ɛnyɛ yɛn nkutoo bio.
However, now is the best time to schedule them.	Nanso, mprempren ne bere a eye sen biara a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ wɔn ho nhyehyɛe.
I hope you enjoy it!.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho!.
This is often not true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware mpɛn pii.
However, there is one claim.	Nanso, nsɛm biako wɔ hɔ a wɔka fa ho.
I look down at his hand	Mehwɛ ne nsa ase
I’d appreciate your help	M’ani begye mo mmoa ho
Whether he liked it or not, he seemed hooked.	Sɛ́ n’ani gye ho anaasɛ n’ani nnye ho no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɔde ne ho ahyɛ mu.
I have a house and a car	Mewɔ ofie ne kar
And there are many more.	Na pii nso ka ho.
I loved the child.	M’ani gyee abofra no ho.
Not as it is now.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛte mprempren no.
I was interested in that	Ná m’ani gye saa asɛm no ho
The reason is irrelevant.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no ho nhia.
I believe that part of the story	Migye saa asɛm no fã no di
And as you can see, it’s pretty obvious.	Na sɛnea wubetumi ahu no, ɛda adi yiye.
His son is late, and it’s me.	Ne ba no aka akyi, na ɛyɛ me.
It’s just a last ditch effort.	Ɛyɛ mmɔden a etwa to ara kwa.
My father is not like that.	Me papa nte saa.
I told him not to forget.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ne werɛ mfi.
I have plenty of time to get there	Mewɔ bere pii a mede bɛkɔ hɔ
I shouldn’t have even thought about it	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ misusuw ho mpo
There was nothing else I liked anymore.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a m’ani gye ho bio.
I think you don’t.	Misusuw sɛ wonyɛ saa.
Things got complicated.	Nneɛma mu yɛɛ den.
So he’s free.	Enti ɔde ne ho.
I can’t tell what’s going on inside, what’s going on outside	Mintumi nhu nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ mu, nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ akyi
He wasn’t even a dog.	Ná ɔnyɛ ɔkraman mpo.
I kind of spent a bad night	Mede anadwo bɔne bi dii dwuma ɔkwan bi so
That’s my nature.	Ɛno ne me su.
I didn’t know how many	Ná minnim dodow ahe
After this, not much at all.	Eyi akyi no, ɛnyɛ pii koraa.
A picture began to form	Mfonini bi fii ase yɛɛ
I knew where he was headed	Ná minim baabi a ɔde n’ani kyerɛ
I still remember it, like it happened yesterday	Meda so ara kae no, te sɛ nea esii nnɛra
No one can touch this man.	Obiara ntumi nka saa ɔbarima yi.
And this room is just that.	Na saa dan yi yɛ saa ara.
We are just friends.	Yɛyɛ nnamfo ara kwa.
Use one or the other.	Fa biako anaa foforo no di dwuma.
I believe it, but it just doesn’t seem necessary.	Migye di, nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia ara kwa.
He did his best to.	Ɔyɛɛ nea obetumi biara sɛ.
I knew the day would come	Ná minim sɛ da no bɛba
You can never show it.	Worentumi mfa nkyerɛ da.
At least we can do this.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yebetumi ayɛ eyi.
The good people.	Nnipa pa no.
Once again, the man fell to the ground.	Saa bere yi nso, ɔbarima no hwee fam.
He had done so.	Ná wayɛ saa.
Needs a hand.	Hia nsa.
I didn’t want anything from him or anyone	Na mempɛ biribiara mfi ne hɔ anaa obiara hɔ
Your day will come.	Wo da no bɛba.
The day has just begun.	Da no afi ase ara kwa.
Therefore, further studies are needed.	Enti, adesua foforo ho hia.
You can see them.	Wubetumi ahu wɔn.
I'll start early tomorrow.	Mede mfi ase ntɛm ɔkyena.
I wish more people would	Me yam a anka nnipa pii bɛyɛ saa
Like he is like that.	Te sɛ nea ɔte saa.
I apologize to him	Mepa no kyɛw
They had all controlled him.	Ná wɔn nyinaa adi no so.
I want to start with you again.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo fi ase bio.
I do have hope.	Mewɔ anidaso ampa.
Something big has happened	Ade kɛse bi asi
But this is simply not the truth.	Nanso eyi nyɛ nokware no ara kwa.
Not that he’s ever seemed to enjoy it much.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye ho kɛse pɛn.
I want to go back with you.	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo san kɔ.
But tonight, this last time, he had to.	Nanso anadwo yi, bere a etwa to yi, na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
A dog will look up at a man	Ɔkraman bɛma n’ani so ahwɛ ɔbarima
There is only one other thing.	Ade foforo biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I was sitting at his desk	Ná mete ne pon so
I really think all of me	Misusuw ankasa sɛ me nyinaa
I really had nothing	Ná minni hwee ankasa
People looked up at me.	Nkurɔfo maa wɔn ani so hwɛɛ me.
But that seems to have happened.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛno na esii.
Anyway, if you do, you do.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, sɛ woyɛ saa a, woyɛ saa.
I am a good guy. 	Meyɛ ɔbarima pa. 
Words weren’t working.	Ná nsɛm ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
We were friends, you know.	Ná yɛyɛ nnamfo, wunim.
For us, your problem is over.	Yɛn fam no, wo haw no aba awiei.
Anyway, you didn’t have to.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na enhia sɛ woyɛ.
I find this completely wrong.	Mihu sɛ eyi yɛ mfomso koraa.
He has a lot to do.	Ɔwɔ pii a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I didn’t have any that morning	Na minni bi saa anɔpa no
It was truly a wonderful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa ampa.
You finally find out.	Awiei koraa no wuhu.
They were all shocked.	Wɔn nyinaa ho dwiriw wɔn.
I didn’t care a bit	Na ɛnyɛ me asɛm kakra
It seems like a long time has passed	Ɛte sɛ nea bere tenten bi atwam
I love how everyone works.	M’ani gye sɛnea obiara yɛ adwuma no ho.
But it doesn’t matter, really.	Nanso ɛnyɛ hwee, ampa.
That shouldn’t be right.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ yiye.
Every single thing.	Ade biako biara.
It was a fascinating meeting.	Ná ɛyɛ nhyiam a ɛyɛ anigye.
I always have that for lunch	Mewɔ saa bere nyinaa ma awia aduan
I seem to be on the big one	Ɛte sɛ nea mewɔ kɛse no so
Use it wisely.	Fa di dwuma yiye.
But it didn’t have to be.	Nanso na enhia sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
A chill went through him	Awɔw bi faa ne mu
This had to be a mistake.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ mfomso.
They are strong.	Wɔyɛ den.
It should be used to simplify the problem.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma de ma ɔhaw no yɛ mmerɛw.
That didn’t happen.	Ɛno anyɛ saa.
Things have really connected down there.	Nneɛma abɔ mu ampa wɔ fam hɔ.
I can’t ‘believe he did such a thing.	Mintumi ‘nnye nni sɛ ɔyɛɛ ade a ɛte saa.
I knew this was my chance	Ná minim sɛ eyi ne hokwan a mewɔ
I want you both to go now	Mepɛ sɛ mo baanu nyinaa kɔ mprempren
Win it if you can.	Di nkonim wɔ mu sɛ wubetumi a.
I kind of liked our new arrangement	M’ani gyee yɛn nhyehyɛe foforo no ho wɔ ɔkwan bi so
Everyone was too excited.	Ná obiara ani agye dodo.
He is there now.	Ɔwɔ hɔ seesei.
It may be big and beautiful.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ kɛse na ayɛ fɛ.
However, she was very beautiful.	Nanso, na ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I can’t see the door	Mintumi nhu ɔpon no
At least three of them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, abiɛsa.
So he did the big thing.	Enti ɔyɛɛ ade kɛse no.
You will be working most of the year.	Wobɛyɛ adwuma wɔ afe no mu bere dodow no ara.
Most of it is.	Ne mu dodow no ara.
He could also check to see if his friends were there.	Ná obetumi nso ahwɛ sɛ ne nnamfo wɔ hɔ anaa.
Most of them are costly.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara yɛ nea ɛho ka yɛ den.
He knew what he wanted.	Ná onim nea ɔpɛ.
There is no doubt about that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I was doing the same thing.	Ná me nso meyɛ saa ara.
Sounds familiar to me to this day.	Ɛte sɛ nea minim no yiye de besi nnɛ.
And that’s about it.	Na ɛno fa ho.
I think it’s in everyone	Misusuw sɛ ɛwɔ obiara mu
I could never hope to do that	Na mintumi nnya anidaso sɛ mɛyɛ saa da
Even this evil brings good.	Saa bɔne yi mpo de papa ba.
I still don't know why this was	Meda so ara nnim nea enti a na eyi te saa
The issue is very important.	Asɛm no ho hia kɛse.
I did that to feel better too	Meyɛɛ saa sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a me nso me ho bɛtɔ me
I’ve loved it for years	M’ani gye ho mfe pii ni
But, think about that.	Nanso, susuw saa asɛm no ho.
Good afternoon, everyone.	Awia pa, obiara.
It was very easy to do right.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ no yiye.
And it’s very important.	Na ɛho hia kɛse.
I was just a girl at the time, and things were hard	Saa bere no na meyɛ abeawa ara kwa, na na nneɛma yɛ den
The police were there.	Ná polisifo no wɔ hɔ.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I know everything that is happening is true	Minim sɛ biribiara a ɛrekɔ so no yɛ nokware
I should have known something.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu biribi.
I can get another job there	Metumi anya adwuma foforo wɔ hɔ
It’s not too bad.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne dodo.
Much hope for all our beautiful children.	Anidaso pii ma yɛn mma a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ no nyinaa.
I loved fancy dresses.	Ná m’ani gye ntade a ɛyɛ fɛ ho.
I thought someone was in big trouble	Misusuwii sɛ obi wɔ ɔhaw kɛse mu
I'm a little sorry about it.	Mepa ho kyɛw kakra.
I'm terrible.	Meyɛ hu.
My cell was gone.	Ná me afiase dan no nni hɔ.
He doesn’t much care what it is.	Nea ɛyɛ no mfa ne ho kɛse.
I need to talk to you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa.
I have a job with him	Me ne no wɔ adwuma
Just curious what my dad worked on	Nea mepɛ sɛ mihu nea me papa yɛɛ ho adwuma ara kwa
I didn’t want to do that anymore	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa bio
I forget his name.	Me werɛ fi ne din.
He worked with them.	Ɔne wɔn yɛɛ adwuma.
I miss you too and think of you everyday.	Me nso mepɛ wo na misusuw wo ho da biara da.
I would have done my best anyway.	Anka mɛyɛ nea metumi biara ɔkwan biara so.
I didn’t want to know	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu
Normally, this has to be a bad thing.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ ade bɔne.
She wants to work with anyone for sex.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne obiara bɛyɛ adwuma ama nna.
I am a very lucky boy.	Meyɛ abarimaa a mewɔ anigye kɛse.
I just want to tell you something very important	Mepɛ sɛ meka biribi a ɛho hia kɛse kyerɛ wo kɛkɛ
And that’s, like, what he was working on.	Na ɛno ne, te sɛ, nea na ɔreyɛ ho adwuma.
I have nothing to offer him	Minni biribiara a mede bɛma no
It is complete and simple.	Ɛyɛ nea edi mũ na ɛnyɛ den.
Obviously I am not thinking clearly right now.	Ɛda adi sɛ minsusuw nneɛma ho yiye mprempren.
You can take it from there.	Wubetumi agye afi hɔ.
To be a human being.	Sɛ́ wobɛyɛ onipa.
I led him to the door	Mede no kɔɔ ɔpon no ano
I think it was, like, a big deal	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ, te sɛ, asɛm kɛse bi
I wish you could forgive him	Me yam a anka wubetumi de akyɛ no
You can’t do it.	Worentumi nyɛ no.
I really like his stuff.	M’ani gye ne nneɛma ho ankasa.
I haven’t been able to do that yet.	Mintumi nyɛ saa de besi nnɛ.
I couldn’t have said that at the time	Anka mintumi nka saa saa bere no
Speaking of which, I am surprised	Sɛ meka asɛm no a, ɛyɛ me nwonwa
But that’s another story!.	Nanso ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo!.
Which I just wanted to know more about you.	Nea na mepɛ sɛ mihu wo ho nsɛm pii ara kwa.
I wanted him to touch me like that	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka me saa
Just think of it as face value.	Fa no sɛ ɛyɛ anim bo ara kwa.
Same job, same food.	Adwuma koro no ara, aduan koro no ara.
I could look into it	Ná metumi ahwɛ mu
I can provide more information	Metumi de nsɛm pii ama
I think this whole thing is such a great idea.	Misusuw sɛ saa ade yi nyinaa yɛ adwene kɛse a ɛte saa.
It wasn’t my fault.	Na ɛnyɛ me mfomso.
Without a doubt, he knows everything about you.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ onim wo ho biribiara.
They are one and the same.	Wɔyɛ biako na wɔyɛ ade koro.
However, my mother was always with me.	Nanso, na me maame ka me ho bere nyinaa wɔ nneɛma ho.
I used to, as a kid	Kan no, na meyɛ saa, sɛ abofra no
I can’t keep up with any of them.	Mintumi ne wɔn mu biara nkɔ so.
He’s a good dog.	Ɔyɛ ɔkraman pa.
I shouldn’t have gone	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mekɔ
He wasn’t doing that.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa.
I knew you would be good	Ná minim sɛ wobɛyɛ papa
I think most people are the same way.	Misusuw sɛ nnipa dodow no ara nso te saa ara.
But it’s better than anything else out there.	Nanso ɛyɛ papa sen biribi foforo biara a ɛwɔ abɔnten hɔ.
That’s why you are perfect for this job.	Ɛno nti na woyɛ pɛ ma adwuma yi no.
This girl had no hands.	Ná abeawa yi nni nsa.
That is a great help.	Ɛno yɛ mmoa kɛse.
I guess not so long ago	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ bere tenten ni koraa
Not in my name.	Ɛnyɛ me din mu.
A man alone in a cell	Ɔbarima bi a ɔno nkutoo wɔ afiase dan bi mu
There is nothing you can do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
It wasn’t quite the same thing.	Ná ɛnyɛ ade koro koraa.
We are in movies.	Yɛwɔ sini ahorow mu.
Doing the same job.	Adwuma koro no ara a wobɛyɛ.
With his last words, he says her name	Ɔde ne nsɛm a etwa to no ka ne din
I should have seen him already	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no dedaw
Be careful when painting.	Hwɛ yiye bere a woreyɛ mfonini no.
I was always there	Ná mewɔ hɔ bere nyinaa
But everything comes with a price.	Nanso biribiara de bo bi ba.
I have to tell them what happened	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka nea esii no kyerɛ wɔn
We enjoyed our work.	Ná yɛn ani gye yɛn adwuma no ho.
I do them several times a year	Meyɛ wɔn mpɛn pii afe biara
One is a conscious mind	Obi yɛ adwene bi a ɛwɔ adwene mu
I have some other things	Mewɔ nneɛma foforo bi
But it was there.	Nanso na ɛwɔ hɔ.
And so he barely knew the city.	Na enti ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na onnim kurow no.
And he doesn’t do that either.	Na ɛno nso ɔnyɛ.
They are human beings.	Wɔyɛ nnipa.
I really like these things	M’ani gye saa nneɛma yi ho ankasa
So all in all, on to the game .	Enti ne nyinaa mu no, kɔ agoru no so .
I really didn’t know him, I know him	Ankasa na minnim no, minim no
He wants no part of this.	Ɔmpɛ eyi fã biara.
In this group.	Wɔ saa kuw yi mu.
I could have gone on and on.	Anka metumi akɔ so akɔ so ayɛ saa.
I have nothing else to do.	Minni biribi foforo biara a mɛyɛ.
I'll be fine in a few hours	Me ho bɛtɔ me wɔ nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi akyi
I don’t have the language.	Minni kasa no.
This is not a new idea.	Eyi nyɛ adwene foforo.
I have to do more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ pii.
I want to hear from him	Mepɛ sɛ mete fi ne hɔ
I just wanted to have fun with everyone	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne obiara gye w’ani ara kwa
I want to trust people	Mepɛ sɛ migye nnipa di
I guess that’s what this is.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne nea eyi yɛ.
That happened to me a few times.	Ɛno too me mpɛn kakraa bi.
And so he knew he was great.	Na enti na onim sɛ ɔyɛ kɛse.
I need to know	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu
I was beautiful.	Ná me ho yɛ fɛ.
We all tell stories.	Yɛn nyinaa ka nsɛm.
I think it would be really easy to do this	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobɛyɛ eyi ankasa
People love weird stories.	Nkurɔfo ani gye nsɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa ho.
I wish we could do that today	Me yam a anka yebetumi ayɛ saa nnɛ
He had nothing.	Ná onni hwee.
A while ago, maybe	Bere tiaa bi a atwam ni, ebia
This was obvious.	Ná eyi da adi.
It should be a great year.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ afe kɛse.
I had forgotten all about that	Ná me werɛ afi saa nneɛma no nyinaa
Everything happened to him.	Biribiara too no.
I can do this in my room	Metumi ayɛ eyi wɔ me dan mu
I love making this for everyone	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ eyi ama obiara
I’m not sure what to do	M’ani gyee me ho
You must come with me now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne me ba mprempren.
The face comes out better than in photos.	Anim no fi adi yiye sen mfonini ahorow mu.
I think that was exciting for them	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno yɛ anigye ma wɔn
And look at the power.	Na hwɛ tumi no.
I wish it were, but it isn’t.	Me yam a anka ɛte saa, nanso ɛnte saa.
But this feels wrong.	Nanso eyi te nka sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
The stuffed animal cannot move from room to room	Aboa a wɔde nneɛma ahyɛ mu no ntumi mfi dan biako mu nkɔ foforo mu
There’s really very little to do.	Kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Isn’t anyone too excited.	So obiara ani nnye ho dodo.
I know how much you like them	Minim sɛnea w’ani gye wɔn ho
I think he might be a dog	Misusuw sɛ ebia ɔyɛ ɔkraman
I can’t see this	Mintumi nhu eyi
Dan was able to talk about it.	Dan tumi kaa ho asɛm.
I’m interested in that	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho
He knows.	Onim.
Say something solid, something real.	Ka biribi a ɛyɛ den, biribi a ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Which was pretty, too pretty.	Nea na ɛyɛ fɛ yiye, ɛyɛ fɛ dodo.
Or, just about as fast.	Anaasɛ, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm saa ara.
Just a squirrel.	Ɔkraman bi kɛkɛ.
I can't see him being any help at all	Mintumi nhu sɛ ɔyɛ mmoa biara koraa
I really wish that had gone better	Me yam a anka ɛno kɔɔ yiye ankasa
I want you to say my name.	Mepɛ sɛ woka me din.
But we do that.	Nanso yɛyɛ saa.
There is little money.	Sika kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I know you have it in you	Minim sɛ wowɔ bi wɔ wo mu
I told him, a little bit.	Meka kyerɛɛ no, kakra.
He was in it.	Ná ɔwɔ mu.
But he wasn’t there.	Nanso na onni hɔ.
I knew it was going to be very difficult	Ná minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ den yiye
It still doesn’t work.	Ɛda so ara ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
It’s not with you.	Ɛnyɛ wo nkyɛn.
Isn’t the idea itself wonderful.	So adwene no ankasa nyɛ nwonwa.
Like our mother.	Te sɛ yɛn maame no.
I believe this is true	Migye di sɛ eyi yɛ nokware
I had forgotten all about him	Ná me werɛ afi ne ho nsɛm nyinaa
I wasn’t a very nice person	Ná menyɛ obi a me ho yɛ fɛ paa
But the numbers speak for themselves.	Nanso dodow no ankasa kasa.
I knew almost nothing about him	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na minnim ne ho hwee
I'm sorry for you.	Mepa wo kyɛw.
I agree with that, but it’s not difficult	Migye tom saa, nanso ɛnyɛ den
And it was so beautiful.	Na na ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
None of this surprised me.	Eyi mu biara anyɛ me nwonwa.
The first is frequency.	Nea edi kan ne mpɛn dodow a wɔde di dwuma.
That is very clear.	Ɛno mu da hɔ yiye.
This was important to him.	Ná eyi ho hia no.
He set it up.	Ɔde sii hɔ.
This situation is getting worse.	Tebea yi reyɛ kɛse.
I didn’t want to, I could have just wrapped it up	Na mempɛ, anka metumi abɔ mu kɛkɛ
Just wrong in numbers, and that’s it.	Mfomso ara kwa wɔ dodow mu, na ɛno ara ne no.
I would love to do that!.	M'ani begye sɛ mɛyɛ saa!.
But to a very large number of people.	Nanso wɔ nnipa dodow bi a ɛdɔɔso yiye nkyɛn.
I had never thought of another man in this way	Ná minsusuw ɔbarima foforo biara ho saa da
I never want this to end	Mempɛ sɛ eyi bɛba awiei da
But none of these things work long term.	Nanso nneɛma yi mu biara nyɛ adwuma bere tenten.
I totally agree with you	Me ne wo yɛ adwene koraa
Show me a plan.	Kyerɛ me nhyehyɛe bi.
We were told he was here.	Wɔka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ ɔwɔ ha.
I have a business to take care of	Mewɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ so
It was fun, fun, fun.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye, anigye, anigye.
That is a huge risk.	Ɛno yɛ asiane kɛse.
I definitely felt the cold	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ metee awɔw no nka
I think a lot of people will follow	Misusuw sɛ nnipa pii bedi akyi
I am one of those kids that no one wants.	Meyɛ saa mmofra a obiara mpɛ no mu biako.
I could see the music now	Ná metumi ahu nnwom no mprempren
Maybe it was in the car.	Ebia na ɛwɔ kar no mu.
I should have known.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
We posted similar posts around the same time.	Yɛde nsɛm a ɛte saa ara too hɔ bɛyɛ bere koro no ara.
So he tells me in his letter.	Enti ɔka kyerɛ me wɔ ne krataa no mu.
No one speaks evil of another.	Obiara nka obi foforo ano bɔne.
This is very easy to do.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ.
Neither do you.	Saa ara na wo nso wonyɛ saa.
Tough.	Den.
I was in this room, and I shouldn't have been	Ná mewɔ dan yi mu, na anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa
Please guide me how to achieve that.	Mesrɛ wo kyerɛ me kwan sɛnea metumi anya saa.
Whatever life he would give her.	Nkwa biara a na ɔde bɛma no.
I know it will at some point	Minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa bere bi
Use both hands.	Fa wo nsa abien no nyinaa di dwuma.
He sits outside the door most of the afternoon.	Ɔte ɔpon no akyi awia no fã kɛse no ara.
However, I didn’t know all the details	Nanso, na minnim nsɛm no mu nsɛm nyinaa
A very interesting city.	Kurow a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
Set aside until just warm to the touch.	Fa to nkyɛn kosi sɛ ɛbɛyɛ hyew kɛkɛ sɛ wode wo nsa bɛka.
I can’t think of anything else	Mintumi nsusuw biribi foforo biara ho
At least it was something.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛyɛ biribi.
We can’t tell.	Yɛrentumi nhu.
Do something important.	Yɛ biribi a ɛho hia.
I believe in him very much	Migye no di yiye
Mine worked well enough.	Me de no yɛɛ adwuma yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Everything else is unpleasant.	Biribiara a aka no nyɛ anigye.
And not in my nature either.	Na ɛnyɛ me su nso mu.
I don't know why, he just does.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa, ɔyɛ saa ara kwa.
I don’t want them now	Mempɛ wɔn mprempren
I can't do it faster	Mintumi nyɛ no ntɛmntɛm sen saa
He didn’t want a job he liked.	Ná ɔmpɛ adwuma a n’ani gye ho.
He wanted to succeed.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ odi yiye.
I thought you should be happy	Misusuwii sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye
For me it’s easy.	Me fam no ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Not even mine, really.	Ɛnyɛ me de mpo, ampa.
First, take a moment.	Nea edi kan no, gye bere tiaa bi.
I hope you will work with me on this.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo ne me bɛyɛ adwuma wɔ eyi ho.
Police say the officers were just wrong	Polisifo se na polisifo no adi mfomso ara kwa
I showed you the pictures	Mede mfonini ahorow no kyerɛɛ wo
I want him to be me	Mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ me ho
Just don’t doubt it.	Mma ho kyim kɛkɛ.
And I hope you deliver	Na mewɔ anidaso sɛ wode bɛma
Your people embrace the issue.	Wo nkurɔfo fa asɛm no tom.
If you do that.	Sɛ woyɛ saa a.
I never wanted a part of them	Ná mempɛ wɔn fã bi da
I'm glad everyone's stealing	Ɛyɛ me anigye sɛ obiara awia
Really excited to join.	Anigye ankasa sɛ wobɛka ho.
A little bit for us.	Kakraa bi ma yɛn.
As every afternoon may be.	Sɛnea ebia awia biara yɛ no.
That thing is amazing.	Saa ade no yɛ nwonwa.
I almost forgot about that girl	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ me werɛ fii saa abeawa no
I want to add a picture in the background.	Mepɛ sɛ mede mfonini bi ka ho wɔ akyi.
But somehow he got involved.	Nanso ɔkwan bi so no, ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu.
For the time being.	Mprempren de.
Or maybe even three.	Anaasɛ ebia abiɛsa mpo.
I love that about them	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho wɔ wɔn ho
Over and over and over again.	Mpɛn pii ne mpɛn pii.
Do the next step.	Yɛ ade a edi hɔ no.
Just what I want to know	Nea mepɛ sɛ mihu nkutoo
Just forget about it.	Wo werɛ mfi kɛkɛ.
I did this in the last project.	Meyɛɛ eyi wɔ adwuma a etwa to no mu.
I'm not sure why this happens.	Me ntumi nhu nea enti a eyi ba.
I didn’t like causing trouble	Ná m’ani nnye ho sɛ mede ɔhaw bɛba
I get that time is money	Me nsa ka sɛ bere yɛ sika
And that feels exciting.	Na ɛno te nka sɛ ɛyɛ anigye.
I got some of your stuff	Me nsa kaa wo nneɛma bi
They just talk about it, and everyone is happy.	Wɔka ho asɛm kɛkɛ, na obiara ani gye.
I wanted to do that so many times	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa mpɛn pii saa
You can believe yours too.	Wubetumi agye wo de nso adi.
Nothing seems to look very appealing.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
I guess he wasn't very nice about it	Misusuw sɛ na ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ kɛse wɔ ho
Usually, it was.	Mpɛn pii no, na ɛyɛ saa.
Live, as if you know what is best for you.	Tra ase, te sɛ nea wunim nea eye ma wo.
She loved her home.	Ná n’ani gye ne fie ho.
It’s a very nice thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He could do nothing.	Ná obetumi anyɛ hwee.
I need to go home for a while	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ fie kakra
Not like he used to be.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea na ɔyɛ kan no.
I had things to do and work to do	Ná mewɔ nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ne adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ
There is nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
I saw a lot of it today, though	Nanso, mihuu no pii nnɛ
I don't know why he did that.	Minnim nea enti a ɔyɛɛ saa.
I went there with him	Me ne no kɔɔ hɔ
This can’t happen so fast.	Eyi ntumi nkɔ so ntɛmntɛm saa.
I was touched and not him	Wɔde me nsa kaa me na ɛnyɛ ɔno
And my name, too.	Na me din nso.
We can say what we like.	Yebetumi aka nea yɛn ani gye ho.
I want you all to be me	Mepɛ sɛ mo nyinaa yɛ me ho
I would have done that	Anka mɛyɛ saa
No one lives here and there are other people.	Obiara nte ha na nnipa foforo ka ho.
His new apartment would be his longtime home	Ná ne dan foforo no bɛyɛ ne fie a ɔde bere tenten ayɛ adwuma
Go play it.	Kɔ bɔ no.
I still think so.	Meda so ara susuw saa.
My mother lives next to him.	Me maame te ne nkyɛn.
A book by his side.	Nhoma bi a ɛwɔ ne nkyɛn.
The excitement was more intense.	Ná anigye no mu yɛ den sen saa.
I wanted to tell him, so bad	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no, bɔne saa
I really enjoy just being with my wife.	M’ani gye ho ankasa sɛ me ne me yere bɛbɔ kɛkɛ.
He might bring that up in a day.	Ebia na ɔde saa asɛm no bɛba da koro mu.
I have had it with him	Me ne no anya bi
People tend to remember first and last.	Nkurɔfo taa kae nea edi kan ne nea edi akyi.
I feel like maybe it should have been	Mete nka sɛ ebia anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa
These issues usually end when the child comes home.	Mpɛn pii no, nsɛm yi ba awiei bere a abofra no ba fie no.
The power is here.	Tumi no wɔ ha.
Greatness is greatness.	Kɛse yɛ kɛse.
That’s a child.	Ɛno yɛ abofra bi.
Good things happen to good people.	Nneɛma pa to nnipa pa so.
This will be easier for you.	Eyi bɛyɛ mmerɛw ama wo.
I was shocked and surprised	Me ho dwiriw me na me ho dwiriw me
It’s too scary for us.	Ɛyɛ hu dodo ma yɛn.
That’s all that was interesting.	Ɛno ara ne nea na ɛyɛ anigye.
But eventually the price will drop.	Nanso awiei koraa no, ne bo bɛkɔ fam.
I can’t see that it exists.	Mintumi nhu sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
I liked this about him	M’ani gyee eyi ho wɔ ne ho
I couldn’t think of anyone else	Ná mintumi nsusuw obi foforo biara ho
Things were still very difficult.	Ná nneɛma da so ara yɛ den yiye.
I wanted to like you	Ná mepɛ sɛ m’ani gye wo ho
You have to think of us.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw yɛn ho.
But more is urgently needed.	Nanso pii ho hia ntɛm ara.
Every year we have to do the same thing.	Afe biara ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ade koro no ara.
Just the truth.	Nokware no ara kwa.
It wasn’t just any idea.	Na ɛnyɛ adwene biara kɛkɛ.
Take the risk.	Fa wo ho to asiane no so.
If not, you can check out how I am doing.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, wubetumi ahwɛ sɛnea mereyɛ.
The story is too clear.	Asɛm no mu da hɔ dodo.
I had a really bad day yesterday	Me nyaa da bɔne ankasa nnɛra
I didn’t want the day to end	Ná mempɛ sɛ da no bɛba awiei
You don’t want to do that.	Wompɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I hope you feel better where you are	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo ho bɛtɔ wo wɔ baabi a wowɔ no
Like the car.	Te sɛ kar no.
I just want it to be a little easier	Mepɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ den kakra kɛkɛ
But someone else has to do it.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ obi foforo yɛ.
I’ll miss all of that	M’ani begye saa nneɛma no nyinaa ho
I don’t want a dog like that.	Mempɛ ɔkraman a ɔte saa.
I never want a big house.	Mempɛ ofie kɛse bi da.
But I didn’t have to do anything.	Nanso na ɛho nhia sɛ meyɛ biribiara.
There are really only a few things to do.	Nneɛma kakraa bi pɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ankasa.
I have a serious problem	Mewɔ ɔhaw kɛse bi
No one hears anything.	Obiara nte hwee.
I looked at him with interest	Mede anigye hwɛɛ no
However, you may not know what the other person wants.	Nanso, ebia wunnim nea onipa foforo no pɛ.
He didn't want her anyway.	Ná ɔmpɛ no ɔkwan biara so.
Adding the good was a lot of bad.	Ná papa no a wɔde bɛka ho no yɛ bɔne pii.
I can't really think of that one.	Mintumi nsusuw saa biako no ho ankasa.
It will become a habit.	Ɛbɛyɛ su.
But it’s enough.	Nanso ɛdɔɔso.
I felt like the unhappy person	Metee nka sɛ onipa a onni anigye no
I wish he would say that again, as well	Me yam a anka ɔbɛka saa asɛm no bio, saa ara
They didn’t have to be really interested.	Na enhia sɛ wɔn ani gye ho ankasa.
That was the way it used to be.	Saa ara na na ɛte pɛn no.
After that, it’s, no more.	Ɛno akyi no, ɛyɛ, ɛnyɛ bio.
I was a child at the time.	Saa bere no na meyɛ abofra.
The scenery was spectacular.	Ná nneɛma a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ nwonwa.
It’s just a necessary look.	Ɛyɛ hwɛ a ɛho hia nkutoo.
But he wasn’t quite in it.	Nanso na onni mu yiye.
Nothing quite like it.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ ɛno koraa.
It was a terrible time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ hu.
I think you’ve worked with him	Misusuw sɛ wo ne no ayɛ adwuma
It was a really strange situation	Ná ɛyɛ tebea a ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa
My first home.	Me fie a edi kan.
Maybe he should have done that.	Ebia na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I know what this is about.	Minim nea eyi fa ho.
You can see it.	Wubetumi ahu.
And so, indeed, it is.	Na saa ara, ampa ara, ɛte saa.
He seemed to be someone else.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ obi foforo.
I feel really bad about it	Mete nka bɔne ankasa wɔ ho
But keep your priorities in order.	Nanso ma nneɛma a wode di kan no nyɛ nhyehyɛe.
I did that, a lot.	Meyɛɛ saa, pii.
He didn’t want us to.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
It would have been so easy.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
I think it was very difficult for him.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ den ma no yiye.
That makes it more convenient.	Ɛno ma ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
It was hot to say the least.	Ná ɛyɛ hyew sɛ obi bɛka.
Every other day, it just gets bigger and empty.	Da foforo biara no, ɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa na hwee nni mu.
A little untrue in that regard.	Ɛnyɛ nokware kakra wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
Often, it was terrible.	Mpɛn pii no, na ɛyɛ hu.
I never should have done that	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa da
Something is still needed.	Biribi da so ara ho hia.
I shouldn’t have put it on you like that	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mede to wo so saa
Just remove it from the house.	Yi fi fie hɔ ara kwa.
Look at where you are.	Hwɛ baabi a wowɔ.
I couldn’t even look away	Na mintumi mfa m’ani so mpo
You have to be friends.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nnamfo.
I wonder why he is doing this	Misusuw nea enti a ɔreyɛ eyi ho
It was expensive.	Ná ne bo yɛ den.
Their intentions, themselves, are not evil.	Wɔn adwene, wɔn ankasa ho, nyɛ bɔne.
I think this one has legs	Misusuw sɛ eyi wɔ nan
Those are all problems.	Ɛno nyinaa yɛ ɔhaw ahorow.
A girl can’t have anything	Abeawa ntumi nnya biribiara
Things get more complicated.	Nneɛma mu yɛ den kɛse.
I wanted to see things	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu nneɛma
We hope you will too.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wo nso wobɛyɛ saa.
If you just want to be a good person, be a terrible person.	Sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ onipa pa ara kwa a, yɛ onipa a ne ho yɛ hu.
Shortly thereafter, he lost consciousness.	Ɛno akyi bere tiaa bi no, n’adwene fii ne ho.
However, I had to go.	Nanso, na ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
At least he did that night.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɔyɛɛ saa anadwo no.
I think we should seize the opportunity	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde hokwan no di dwuma
Put this in the box.	Fa eyi hyɛ mu.
But only if you want me to.	Nanso sɛ wopɛ sɛ meyɛ saa nkutoo a.
I hardly know how to say it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ minnim sɛnea mɛka.
This does not apply to one party or another.	Eyi mfa apontow biako anaa foforo ho.
I wanted to know what year his head was in.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu afe a ne ti wɔ mu.
This is true of every team at this point.	Eyi te saa wɔ kuw biara ho wɔ saa bere yi mu.
I can barely feel it at all	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nte nka koraa
Or at least it seemed that way.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
Think about what you want, not what you don’t want.	Susuw nea wopɛ ho, na ɛnyɛ nea wompɛ.
Think about it.	Susuw ho hwɛ.
I was still staring at him	Ná meda so ara hwɛ no denneennen
He had no plan of action.	Ná onni nhyehyɛe biara a ɔde bɛyɛ ade.
The food police.	Aduan ho polisifo a wɔyɛ no.
It was everything.	Ná ɛyɛ biribiara.
Everything went really well and has worked.	Biribiara kɔɔ yiye ankasa na ayɛ adwuma.
I don’t know if that tells us anything	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno kyerɛ yɛn biribi anaa
Can’t do anything.	Ntumi nyɛ hwee.
I have homework every night	Mewɔ fie nnwuma anadwo biara
Maybe their time is up.	Ebia wɔn bere atwam.
And there was no shortage.	Na na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛho nhia.
I need to get that	Ɛsɛ sɛ me nsa ka saa asɛm no
But think again.	Nanso susuw ho bio.
There had to be more.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ pii wɔ hɔ.
I could never take another man’s life	Na mintumi mfa ɔbarima foforo nkwa da
I couldn’t see anything anymore	Ná mintumi nhu hwee bio
So everyone stays.	Enti obiara tra hɔ.
This was the scariest thing	Ná eyi ne ade a ɛyɛ hu sen biara
He is a man of integrity.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a odi nokware.
Check it out below.	Hwɛ no wɔ ase ha.
Feed, but that comes later.	Ma aduan, nanso ɛno ba akyiri yi.
And that could mean anything.	Na ɛno betumi akyerɛ biribiara.
I could never really do it	Na mintumi nyɛ no ankasa da
I can’t understand that	Mintumi nte saa asɛm no ase
They are very strong indeed.	Wɔyɛ den yiye ampa.
I hope he is not in danger	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ onni asiane mu
But it’s not my money.	Nanso ɛnyɛ me sika.
You know him, man.	Wunim no, onipa.
But not today.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nnɛ.
He is a strong man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ den.
It should be the case.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
Get out of the alive.	Fi adi nkwa mu.
I think this is a great project	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma kɛse bi
I can be a good girl too, you know	Me nso metumi ayɛ abeawa pa, wunim
. . . .	.
Which was pretty amazing.	Nea na ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
Now it is working.	Seesei reyɛ adwuma.
I'm sure there are entire works just for this story	Migye di sɛ nnwuma mũ no nyinaa wɔ hɔ ma saa asɛm yi ara
I’m not even happy.	M’ani nnye mpo.
I want to thank you for your services	Mepɛ sɛ meda mo ase wɔ mo nnwuma ho
I know all about that big deal	Minim saa ade kɛse no ho nsɛm nyinaa
I hope everything goes well	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ biribiara bɛkɔ yiye
I should never have started with you	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ me ne wo fi ase da
I don’t want to say that	Mempɛ sɛ meka sɛ
I no longer cared what he thought	Ná nea osusuw ho no mfa me ho bio
He always wanted me like something else.	Ná ɔpɛ me bere nyinaa te sɛ biribi foforo.
I couldn’t raise my hand	Na mintumi mma me nsa so
I have a quick mind	Mewɔ adwene a ɛyɛ ntɛm
I was totally involved	Ná mede me ho ahyɛ mu koraa
I was weak.	Ná meyɛ mmerɛw.
I only care about one thing	Ade biako pɛ na ɛho hia me
I think we have a lot in common.	Misusuw sɛ yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ pɛ.
I’m so glad you all can do it	M’ani agye yiye sɛ mo nyinaa betumi ayɛ
I had no idea how beautiful it was	Ná minnim sɛnea ɛyɛ fɛ no
This all felt very fake to me.	Eyi nyinaa yɛɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ atoro yiye maa me.
It’s my choice.	Ɛyɛ me pɛ.
It’s all part of that.	Ne nyinaa yɛ ɛno fã.
And this time, we’ll do it right.	Na saa bere yi, yɛbɛyɛ no yiye.
The letter was very positive.	Ná krataa no yɛ nea ɛyɛ papa yiye.
That we can treat it as a given.	Sɛ yebetumi ne no adi sɛ nea wɔde ama yɛn.
I need to get used to this technique	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa ɔkwan yi ho su
He looks too boyish for me.	Ɔte sɛ abarimaa dodo ma me.
I imagine he is one of them	Meyɛ m’adwene sɛ ɔyɛ no mu biako
Almost all of them claim to be real.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔn nyinaa ka sɛ wɔyɛ nnipa ankasa.
I still hoped it wasn’t about me	Ná meda so ara wɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ me ho asɛm
The problem is with my tests.	Ɔhaw no fa me sɔhwɛ ahorow no ho.
I was never so clear-headed	Ná m’adwene mu da hɔ saa da
Hours must have passed.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ nnɔnhwerew pii atwam.
He should be imprisoned.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde no to afiase.
It’s a wonderful job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Recently implemented.	Nnansa yi ara wɔde dii dwuma.
It’s just a great game.	Ɛyɛ agoru kɛse bi kɛkɛ.
I can’t do that anymore	Mintumi nyɛ saa bio
And this is something.	Na eyi yɛ biribi.
I liked it enough	M’ani gyee ho sɛnea ɛsɛ
There is nothing here.	Biribiara nni ha.
I think about it many times	Misusuw ho mpɛn pii
I understood it very well	Metee ase yiye
Now he knows what he is doing every day.	Seesei onim nea ɔreyɛ da biara da.
I had to think of something	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw biribi ho
Such an attitude is commonplace.	Su a ɛte saa no yɛ asɛm a nnipa pii nim.
Look at this.	Hwɛ eyi.
It wasn’t really about anything.	Na ɛnyɛ biribiara ho asɛm ankasa.
What is it that is.	Dɛn ne de.
He will be a little better.	Ɔbɛyɛ papa kakra.
I'm so worried about you	Wo ho haw me paa
I knew then and they all meant it	Na minim saa bere no na wɔn nyinaa kyerɛ saa
I had to see him this morning	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no anɔpa yi
A situation is a situation	Tebea bi yɛ tebea bi
I know we have it great.	Minim sɛ yɛwɔ no kɛse.
A good time.	Bere a ɛyɛ papa.
But you want power.	Nanso wopɛ tumi.
What you do is much more important than what you should do.	Nea woyɛ no ho hia kɛse sen nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Within.	Wɔ mu.
I hope he is young enough to get past this	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔyɛ abofra a obetumi atwam eyi
After that, things started moving very quickly.	Ɛno akyi no, nneɛma fii ase kɔɔ ntɛmntɛm paa.
Any.	Biara.
I can still feel his warm hands on mine	Meda so ara tumi te ne nsa a ɛyɛ hyew no nka wɔ me de no so
But, I love doing it	Nanso, m’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ
I was still very worried	Ná meda so ara haw kɛse
That did get his attention.	Ɛno maa n’adwene sii so ampa.
It never happens again.	Ɛnyɛ bio da.
One of them was wearing shoes.	Ná wɔn mu biako da mpaboa.
But promise me something.	Nanso hyɛ me bɔ biribi.
Only when something went wrong.	Bere a biribi ankɔ yiye nkutoo.
Ever.	Pɛn.
Which I just couldn’t control	Nea na mintumi nni wɔn so kɛkɛ
You’re interested in this.	W’ani gye eyi ho.
The man looked up.	Ɔbarima no maa n’ani so.
In this case, the.	Wɔ eyi mu no.
It was also very expensive, and it looked cheap.	Ná ne bo yɛ den yiye nso, na ɛte sɛ nea ne bo yɛ mmerɛw.
I planned to do this month right	Meyɛɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mɛyɛ ɔsram yi yiye
These people had seen the downward spiral.	Ná saa nkurɔfo yi ahu sɛnea nneɛma rekɔ fam.
But no one does that.	Nanso obiara nyɛ saa.
I was at work and saw them	Ná mewɔ adwuma bi mu na mihuu wɔn
It was me, alone.	Na ɛyɛ me, me nkutoo.
During this time, there was much to do.	Wɔ saa bere yi mu no, na nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
He had his eyes on her.	Ná n’ani wɔ ne so.
They were really good.	Ná wɔyɛ papa ankasa.
It’s something my dad must have liked.	Ɛyɛ biribi a ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na me papa ani gye ho.
What follows is just amazing.	Nea edi hɔ no yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
I nodded my head.	Mede me ti too fam.
He ran to the ground.	Ɔde mmirika bɔɔ fam.
Want.	Pɛ.
I like working alone	M’ani gye ho sɛ me nkutoo yɛ adwuma
Maybe that was the last time he did this.	Ebia ɛno ne bere a etwa to a ɔyɛɛ eyi.
I should have thought it would.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Lie to yourself if you want, but don’t lie to me.	Di atoro kyerɛ wo ho sɛ wopɛ a, nanso nni atoro nkyerɛ me.
I wish they would do that.	Me yam a anka wɔyɛ saa.
A few are quite clear	Kakraa bi da hɔ koraa
So, start now.	Enti, fi ase mprempren.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
It either exists or it doesn’t.	Ɛwɔ hɔ anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
I have to save his life.	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye ne nkwa.
The same is true in my house.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ me fie.
A terrible and terrible debt stuffing	Ɔka a wɔde ahyɛ mu ma a ɛyɛ hu na ɛyɛ hu
I can use it this afternoon	Metumi de adi dwuma awia yi
I knew it didn’t matter.	Ná minim sɛ ɛho nhia.
People will be interested.	Nkurɔfo ani begye ho.
He nods his head down.	Ɔde ne ti to fam.
Su couldn't see.	Su antumi anhu ade.
They eat with that food.	Wɔde saa aduan no di aduan.
I didn’t want to see new people	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu nnipa foforo
I am not doing this	Ɛnyɛ me na mereyɛ eyi
But it wasn’t his.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ne de.
We can give it today.	Yebetumi de ama nnɛ.
I have to be careful	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye
I knew he would attend	Ná minim sɛ ɔbɛkɔ nhyiam no
Many already knew and admired him	Ná nnipa pii nim no dedaw na na wɔn ani gye ne ho
You have to be the best.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nea eye sen biara.
This is nothing new.	Eyi nyɛ ade foforo.
Many things.	Nneɛma pii.
He was working now.	Na ɔreyɛ adwuma mprempren.
Maintenance measures should always come first.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma a wɔyɛ de hwɛ nneɛma so no di kan bere nyinaa.
I don’t want to think about anything.	Mempɛ sɛ misusuw biribiara ho.
I feel great with you.	Mete nka kɛse sɛ me ne wo wɔ hɔ.
Rule over your people	Di wo nkurɔfo so
This has really gone on too long.	Eyi akɔ so akyɛ dodo ankasa.
I feel for him	Mete nka ma no
It was a week away now.	Ná aka dapɛn biako mprempren.
Both were successful	Wɔn baanu nyinaa dii yiye
I did it too quickly.	Meyɛɛ no ​​ntɛmntɛm dodo.
I knew it was none of that	Ná minim sɛ ɛnyɛ saa mmoa no mu biara
I wish you could see her.	Me yam a anka wubetumi ahu no.
Do one, a few, or all.	Yɛ biako, kakraa bi, anaa ne nyinaa.
I have provided some of the information below	Mede nsɛm a ɛwɔ ase ha no bi ama
I want opportunities like everyone else.	Mepɛ hokwan te sɛ obiara.
I have to understand	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete ase
It’s not a car accident.	Ɛnyɛ kar akwanhyia.
I thought that was all that was left of the front door	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno ne nea aka wɔ anim pon no ho
I was sitting next to him	Ná mete ne nkyɛn
Enough now.	Ɛdɔɔso mprempren.
It’s a good story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm pa.
That was a very long time ago.	Ɛno yɛ bere tenten paa a atwam ni.
I pointed to the moon	Mede me nsa kyerɛɛ ɔsram no so
I want to be a good guy again	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ɔbarima pa bio
I just put the money down today	Mede sika no too hɔ nnɛ ara kwa
I knew the character	Ná minim ɔbarima no su
I wish this was the end of the story	Me yam a anka eyi yɛ asɛm no awiei
I just can’t see it	Mintumi nhu no kɛkɛ
And he did so.	Na ɔyɛɛ saa.
None of these things are true.	Saa nneɛma yi mu biara nyɛ nokware.
Hands down the best.	Nsa ase nea eye sen biara.
However, the information adds something.	Nanso, nsɛm no de biribi ka ho.
I will devote some time to it this weekend.	Mede bere kakra bɛma no dapɛn awiei yi.
I wanted her to be happy	Ná mepɛ sɛ n’ani gye
That thing really happened at home.	Saa ade no sii wɔ fie ankasa.
I parked and drove over	Mede kar no sii hɔ na mede kar no kɔɔ hɔ
I want to talk about this.	Mepɛ sɛ meka eyi ho asɛm.
I have to admit it was amazing	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye tom sɛ na ɛyɛ nwonwa
There was something down there after all.	Na biribi wɔ fam hɔ wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
It’s the most amazing thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen biara.
It may only be for a short time, or a few hours.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ bere tiaa bi pɛ, anaa nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi.
In a way, it is.	Ɔkwan bi so no.
It was absolutely cold.	Ná awɔw wom koraa.
And obviously, there are a variety of possibilities.	Na ɛda adi sɛ, nneɛma ahorow betumi aba saa.
The time has finally come.	Awiei koraa no, bere no adu.
I never go out with him	Me ne no nkɔ abɔnten da
We have that one.	Yɛwɔ saa biako no.
It’s still wet, but you can manage it.	Ɛda so ara yɛ nsu, nanso wubetumi ayɛ no yiye.
I had completely forgotten	Ná me werɛ afi koraa
But give me time.	Nanso ma me bere.
Things can happen in any business.	Nneɛma betumi asi wɔ adwuma biara mu.
You don’t have to think of anything big.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wususuw biribi kɛse bi ho.
I knew all the kids would love this.	Ná minim sɛ mmofra no nyinaa ani begye eyi ho.
I think it’s the same.	Misusuw sɛ ɛte saa.
It is obviously a mistake.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso.
There is no money in it.	Sika biara nni mu.
He would have loved this house.	Anka n’ani begye ofie yi ho.
I can’t let myself be in them	Mintumi mma me ho nni wɔn mu
A little bit of fun too.	Anigye kakraa bi nso.
A large squirrel.	Ɔkraman kɛse bi.
I was never a happy person	Ná menyɛ obi a ɔwɔ anigye da
There are elements of that	Ɛno mu nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ
Over the years.	Mfe pii a atwam no.
Look, please look at him.	Hwɛ, mesrɛ wo hwɛ no.
I didn’t know this	Ná minnim eyi
I want better, but this isn't too bad	Mepɛ sɛ eye sen saa, nanso eyi nyɛ bɔne dodo
I wanted to watch the game too.	Ná me nso mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ agoru no.
Say nothing about him.	Nka ne ho hwee.
I agreed with him, and we all agreed	Me ne no yɛɛ adwene, na yɛn nyinaa nso yɛɛ adwene
I really wanted to lie down.	Ná mepɛ paa sɛ meda fam.
I have the whole thing.	Mewɔ ade no nyinaa.
You know the story.	Wunim asɛm no.
Too afraid of something.	Biribi ho suro dodo.
I didn't want him to touch me.	Ná mempɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa bɛka me.
So he is in it.	Enti ɔwɔ mu.
I thought he might be gone that evening	Misusuwii sɛ ebia na onni hɔ anwummere no
I put my thoughts aside	Mede m’adwene too nkyɛn
I disagree with him here	Me ne no nyɛ adwene wɔ ha
I felt like we couldn’t go	Metee nka sɛ yɛrentumi nkɔ
I was shocked and so were my friends	Me ho dwiriw me na saa ara na na me nnamfo nso ho dwiriw me
That one was three years old.	Ná saa biako no adi mfe abiɛsa.
I can take us there, not a problem	Metumi de yɛn akɔ hɔ, ɛnyɛ ɔhaw
I have to stay strong	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ den
You can find their comments here.	Wubetumi ahu wɔn nsɛm wɔ ha.
I think it’s great but it’s too short	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse nanso ɛyɛ tiaa dodo
I can’t think of anywhere else to go	Mintumi nsusuw baabi foforo biara a mɛkɔ ho
It should be in both of our names.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ yɛn abien no nyinaa din mu.
That’s not even an issue.	Ɛno nyɛ asɛm mpo.
In a way, that was all he had.	Ɔkwan bi so no, ɛno nkutoo ne nea na ɔwɔ.
I am very much looking forward to it.	Mehwɛ kwan paa.
Think about it later.	Susuw ho akyiri yi.
But one way or the other it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɔkwan biako anaa ɔkwan foforo so no mfa ho.
But anything is possible.	Nanso biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye.
It’s a nice day outside.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye wɔ abɔnten.
But this took time.	Nanso eyi gyee bere.
I’m so happy for you	M’ani agye paa ma wo
You only get one chance.	Wo nsa ka hokwan biako pɛ.
I want to say it again	Mepɛ sɛ meka bio
And it was there.	Na ɛwɔ hɔ.
So this is obviously incomplete.	Enti ɛda adi sɛ eyi nni mũ.
But he knows it too.	Nanso ɔno nso nim.
I think this was a mistake	Misusuw sɛ na eyi yɛ mfomso
I have to think about it carefully	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho yiye
I should have been there for him	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ ma no
I can be anything you want me to be	Metumi ayɛ biribiara a wopɛ sɛ meyɛ
It’s too bad for me.	Ɛyɛ bɔne dodo ma me.
Tell him you think it would be a good idea.	Ka kyerɛ no sɛ wususuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwene pa.
It is untimely, and therefore more dangerous.	Ɛnyɛ bere mu de, na ɛno nti ɛyɛ hu kɛse.
Every single day.	Da koro biara.
I trusted him deeply	Mede me ho too ne mu yiye
You need to remember this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wokae eyi.
I squinted at him. 	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ no. 
So simple things.	Enti nneɛma a ɛnyɛ den.
I walked him home, just in case	Mede ne nan kɔɔ fie, sɛ ebia biribi bɛba a
You seemed so strong.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wo ho yɛ den yiye.
I admit my mistake.	Migye me mfomso tom.
Otherwise, there is no such thing.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
And you know it was there.	Na wunim na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I wish there was time to make it all better	Me yam a anka bere wɔ hɔ a mede bɛma ne nyinaa ayɛ yiye
A terrible situation.	Tebea a ɛyɛ hu.
Usually it just looks like this	Mpɛn pii no ɛte sɛ eyi ara kwa
Have a great week everyone!!!.	Ma dapɛn pa biara obiara!!!.
Let him check it out!.	Ma no hwɛ!.
I knew he could and would	Ná minim sɛ obetumi ayɛ saa na ɔbɛyɛ saa
I wish it were true, though.	Me yam a anka ɛyɛ nokware, nanso.
I have nothing to say to you, and I have nothing, nor do I have any.	Minni asɛm biara a mɛka akyerɛ mo, na minni hwee, na saa ara nso na minni bi.
I no longer needed to feel alone	Ná enhia sɛ mete nka sɛ me nkutoo na mete nka bio
I wanted that to come to an end	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɛno ba awiei koraa
Most of the time, we do.	Mpɛn pii no, yɛyɛ saa.
This is good news.	Eyi yɛ nsɛm pa.
Just tell him you’re doing it.	Ka kyerɛ no kɛkɛ sɛ woreyɛ saa.
You know, they make stories.	Wunim, wɔyɛ nsɛm.
There was little time for anything else.	Ná bere kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ ma biribi foforo biara.
Her hair fell to her eyes.	Ne ti nhwi hwee n’ani so.
That doesn’t seem too difficult.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno nyɛ den dodo.
None of them did anything wrong.	Wɔn mu biara anyɛ bɔne biara.
Maybe not even then.	Ebia ɛnyɛ saa bere no mpo.
I hope someone can point me in the right direction	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ obi betumi akyerɛ me kwan pa
Things will get better.	Nneɛma bɛkɔ yiye.
Or both of them.	Anaasɛ abien no nyinaa.
But this takes time.	Nanso eyi gye bere.
I did that at all.	Meyɛɛ saa koraa.
I trust in your power	Mede me ho to mo tumi so
No one has it.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔwɔ bi.
I wanted to talk to him	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa
We have used him before.	Yɛde no adi dwuma pɛn.
Forgetting the good truth is a bad thing.	Nokware pa a wɔn werɛ fi no yɛ ade bɔne.
I understand everything	Mete biribiara ase
He could use it as he pleased.	Ná obetumi de adi dwuma sɛnea ɔpɛ.
I always wanted to know	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu bere nyinaa
I wish he would touch it again	Me yam a anka ɔde ne nsa bɛka bio
It doesn’t have to be that way.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛte saa.
I really enjoyed all the characters in this book	M’ani gyee nhoma yi mu nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no nyinaa ho ankasa
But it feels like me.	Nanso ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ me.
I knew he was too good to be true	Ná minim sɛ ɔyɛ papa dodo sɛ ɔbɛka nokware
That was certainly his intention.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛno ne n’adwene.
On the other hand, not so much.	Ɔkwan foforo no, ɛnyɛ pii saa.
But only on certain days.	Nanso nna bi nkutoo mu.
I work very simply.	Meyɛ adwuma wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw so yiye.
I use a lot of the feedback	Mede nsɛm a wɔka fa mu no pii di dwuma
It wasn’t pretty at all.	Ná ɛnyɛ fɛ koraa.
I have to do it my way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ no me kwan so.
He knew this game.	Ná onim saa agoru yi.
We hope you will do more.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wobɛyɛ pii.
You know, you know.	Wunim, wunim.
No one here is willing to help.	Obiara nni ha a ɔwɔ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔbɛboa.
Use it any way you can.	Fa di dwuma ɔkwan biara a wubetumi so.
It seems to have power.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ tumi.
However, I had a lot of things to do tonight	Nanso, na mewɔ nneɛma pii a mɛyɛ anadwo yi
I just want a little power for myself	Mepɛ tumi kakra ma me ho ara kwa
A lot of things are clear now	Nneɛma pii mu da hɔ mprempren
I want them to like my paintings.	Mepɛ sɛ wɔn ani gye me mfonini ahorow ho.
It has to get the job done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ edi adwuma no ho dwuma.
Who wanted to say anything, absolutely anything.	Nea na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka biribiara, biribiara koraa.
You’re right there.	Wowɔ hɔ ara.
I'm sure you know enough by now though	Migye di sɛ wunim nea ɛdɔɔso mprempren de, nanso
I told you it was a big deal	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse
It’s not the whole picture, though.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ mfonini no nyinaa.
I was sitting alone after all	Ná me nkutoo na mete hɔ wɔ ne nyinaa akyi
But that’s not the first thing here.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne ade a edi kan wɔ ha.
But there was never anything like that.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa da.
It couldn’t do it.	Antumi anyɛ.
I realize the child means a lot to you	Mihu sɛ abofra no kyerɛ pii ma wo
It’s very, very unlikely.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛnyɛ yiye koraa, koraa.
Now that’s all gone.	Seesei ɛno nyinaa akɔ.
People would talk about it.	Ná nkurɔfo bɛka ho asɛm.
I have school tomorrow	Mewɔ sukuu ɔkyena
It was a good plan.	Ná ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe pa.
Think quality not quantity.	Susuw su ho na ɛnyɛ dodow ho.
Many people are unemployed.	Nnipa pii nni adwuma.
But you are a hot girl.	Nanso woyɛ abeawa a wo ho yɛ hyew.
One thing is for sure, though.	Nanso, ade biako yɛ nokware paa.
I just love that demographic.	M’ani gye saa nnipa dodow no ho ara kwa.
When you put it in danger.	Bere a wode ba asiane mu no.
Many people couldn’t do that.	Ná nnipa pii ntumi nyɛ saa.
I want you here, with me, like this	Mepɛ wo ha, wo ne me, te sɛ eyi
It’s a story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm bi.
You used to know some of the same people.	Kan no na wunim nnipa koro no ara bi.
I knew this.	Ná minim eyi.
I feel completely satisfied with myself	Mete nka sɛ m’ani agye me ho koraa
I was onto something	Ná mewɔ biribi so
He could use the money.	Ná obetumi de sika no adi dwuma.
I knew my father.	Ná minim me papa.
But things were still difficult for him.	Nanso na nneɛma da so ara yɛ den ma no.
I really have to go now	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ mprempren ankasa
I can’t have him alone	Mintumi nnya no nkutoo
Our team makes sure it’s awesome	Yɛn kuw no hwɛ hu sɛ ɛyɛ hu
Maybe he didn’t even know.	Ebia na onnim mpo.
I want to go with you	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kɔ
Money is one reason.	Sika yɛ ade biako nti a ɛte saa.
His people, many of them, can’t find jobs.	Ne nkurɔfo, wɔn mu pii, ntumi nnya adwuma.
And your money, too.	Na wo sika nso.
I think that’s very interesting.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ anigye kɛse.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia.
I think that would be a first	Misusuw sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ nea edi kan
There were real people here.	Ná nnipa ankasa wɔ ha.
Hurry up and do it.	Yɛ ntɛm mfa nyɛ ho.
I liked that they liked it	M’ani gyee ho sɛ wɔn ani gyee ho
I want to know everything that happened that night	Mepɛ sɛ mihu biribiara a esii saa anadwo no
I wasn’t always easy	Ná ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na meyɛ mmerɛw
I was very interested in the stuff	Ná mewɔ nneɛma no ho anigye kɛse
They do this a lot.	Wɔyɛ eyi pii.
It’s too long.	Ɛyɛ tenten dodo.
I had nothing to offer here either	Na minni biribiara a mede bɛma wɔ ha nso
It was like being at home.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea mewɔ fie.
You do that.	Woyɛ saa.
I need to have you inside me	Ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ wo wɔ me mu
There is nothing to be happy about.	Biribiara nni hɔ a yɛn ani begye ho.
I like the way things are now.	M’ani gye sɛnea nneɛma te mprempren no ho.
I see her head bobbing back	Mihu sɛ ne ti rebɔ ne ho akɔ akyi
What he should feel.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte nka.
You could tell from the pictures that it was something there.	Ná wubetumi ahu wɔ mfonini ahorow no mu sɛ ɛyɛ biribi wɔ hɔ.
I had my dad and friends	Ná mewɔ me papa ne me nnamfo
The girl is beautiful.	Abeawa no yɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I couldn’t figure out how many there were	Na mintumi nhu dodow a ɛwɔ hɔ
We are all stakeholders in this city.	Yɛn nyinaa yɛ wɔn a yɛde wɔn ho hyɛ kurow yi mu.
I wanted to touch them.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mede me nsa ka wɔn.
I think this is really for us	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ yɛn de ankasa
I find this strange.	Mihu sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa.
She is very beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ yiye.
It will be used for faster access.	Wɔde bedi dwuma de anya bi ntɛmntɛm.
That was a plan.	Ná ɛno yɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
I put everything aside and close my eyes	Mede biribiara to nkyɛn na meka m’ani
I can’t hear anything, that’s all	Mintumi nte hwee, ɛno ara
It just wasn’t a problem.	Na ɛnyɛ ɔhaw biara kɛkɛ.
I use it for everything.	Mede di dwuma ma biribiara.
I can’t prove it to myself	Mintumi nkyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware nkyerɛ me ho
I'm not sure this is the best way anyway.	Me nnye nni sɛ eyi ne ɔkwan a eye sen biara ɔkwan biara so.
I had most of the money	Ná mewɔ sika no fã kɛse no ara
You really shouldn’t talk to him like that.	Ankasa ɛnsɛ sɛ wo ne no kasa saa.
I can’t believe what’s happening	Mintumi nnye nea ɛrekɔ so no nni
If not, it’s fine.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, eye.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnte saa.
But to many, she was beautiful.	Nanso wɔ nnipa pii fam no, na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
That has worked for me.	Ɛno ayɛ adwuma ama me.
Strong legs, back, arms.	Nan a ɛyɛ den, akyi, nsa.
I knew what to say.	Ná minim nea mɛka.
I hope everyone has a fantastic weekend	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ obiara anya dapɛn awiei a ɛyɛ nwonwa
Here is why it is so.	Nea enti a ɛte saa ni.
He doesn’t seem to know this.	Ɛte sɛ nea onnim eyi.
It will be easy enough.	Ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I don't know why not.	Minnim nea enti a ɛnte saa.
I couldn’t think of what to say.	Ná mintumi nsusuw nea mɛka ho.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
I’m so excited to give it to him.	M’ani agye yiye sɛ mede bɛma no.
I had to keep doing that	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ saa
I can’t take you with me.	Mintumi mfa wo nka me ho.
I also had other ideas	Ná mewɔ adwene foforo nso
But two problems.	Nanso ɔhaw abien.
If a product fails, there is a problem.	Sɛ ade bi antumi anyɛ adwuma a, ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ.
He has the whole thing.	Ɔwɔ ade mũ no nyinaa.
He is not a planner.	Ɔnyɛ nhyehyɛe.
It’s not something you can plan.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a wubetumi ayɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
I feel like he is now a part of me	Mete nka sɛ mprempren ɔyɛ me fã
Maybe you can.	Ebia wubetumi.
I know it sounds terrible	Minim sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu
This thing you have to do.	Saa ade yi ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I almost saw him outside his house	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mihuu no wɔ ne fie akyi
I didn’t have to do that	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa
Lately it’s all about him.	Nnansa yi ne nyinaa fa ne ho.
I wanted to make another film.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ sini foforo.

I wanted things to work out	Ná mepɛ sɛ nneɛma kɔ yiye
He has been great to work with.	Wayɛ kɛse sɛ ɔne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
I keep giving him money	Mekɔ so de sika ma no
He is doing a lot better.	Ɔreyɛ pii yiye.
A city was like that.	Ná kurow bi te saa.
I can’t imagine it now	Mintumi nsusuw ho mprempren
It’s too painful.	Ɛyɛ yaw dodo.
This was a problem.	Ná eyi yɛ ɔhaw.
I never wanted to do that.	Na mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa da.
But everything is going in the right direction.	Nanso biribiara rekɔ ɔkwan pa so.
I use them myself.	Mede wɔn di dwuma me ankasa.
Her soft, graceful hand caressed his luscious head.	Ne nsa a ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ fɛ no de ne nsa bɔɔ ne ti a ɛyɛ anigye no.
I think that’s what he was doing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne nea na ɔreyɛ.
It was never an issue.	Ná ɛnyɛ asɛm da.
I like them both, but which do you like?	M’ani gye wɔn baanu nyinaa ho, nanso dɛn na w’ani gye ho?
As long as you want.	Bere tenten a wopɛ.
I want to see you tomorrow, if possible	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wo ɔkyena, sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye a
It’s going well so far.	Ɛrekɔ yiye de besi nnɛ.
In any case.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no.
It looks even better in person.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye sen saa mpo wɔ ankasa mu.
I was partially fine with it	Ná meyɛ no yiye fã bi
And your son, too.	Na wo ba no nso.
This is the story behind this innovation!.	Eyi ne asɛm a ɛwɔ saa ade foforo yi akyi!.
But this may be too soon.	Nanso ebia eyi yɛ ntɛm dodo.
I don’t want to bring it up	Mempɛ sɛ mede bɛba
Do not touch him for anything.	Mfa wo nsa nka no mma biribiara.
We forgot about him.	Yɛn werɛ fii no.
That night was such a moment.	Saa anadwo no yɛ bere a ɛte saa.
I'm sorry about that, by the way.	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ ɛno ho, ɔkwan bi so no.
Turn those people around.	Dan saa nkurɔfo no.
But that’s a problem.	Nanso ɛno yɛ ɔhaw.
He wasn’t doing anything wrong.	Ná ɔnyɛ bɔne biara.
I knew that right away	Ná minim saa ntɛm ara
I'm going to go into it here	Mekɔ m’ani so wɔ mu wɔ ha
I wanted to know what was going on	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so
But there wasn’t a single picture of me, and this hurt.	Nanso na me ho mfonini biako mpo nni hɔ, na eyi yɛɛ me yaw.
His head no.	Ne ti no.
I lie in bed all afternoon	Meda mpa so awia mũ no nyinaa
Maybe it’s our fault.	Ebia ɛyɛ yɛn mfomso.
I was only told this morning	Wɔka kyerɛɛ me anɔpa yi nkutoo
Which is good anyway.	Nea eye ɔkwan biara so.
There are no other things.	Nneɛma foforo biara nni hɔ.
The child's mother.	Abofra no maame.
I didn’t know at the time how young he was	Saa bere no na minnim sɛnea na ɔyɛ abofra no
I am still his mother	Meda so ara yɛ ne maame
I have concluded with that.	Mede saa asɛm no aba awiei.
The night was sober for both of us.	Ná anadwo no yɛ nea yɛn baanu nyinaa ani da hɔ.
I need to talk to him	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa
I had a pretty good idea.	Ná mewɔ adwene a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I really, really like them.	M’ani gye wɔn ho ankasa, ankasa.
Many things can happen during such a time.	Nneɛma pii betumi asi wɔ bere a ɛte saa mu.
I used to be just like them	Kan no na meyɛ sɛ wɔn ara pɛ
Without a doubt, it was.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛte saa.
There’s just so much more.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ pii ara kwa.
When he had no idea what was coming next.	Bere a na onni nea edi hɔ no ho adwene biara.
It’s not just that.	Ɛnyɛ kɛkɛ.
I wasn’t doing well in school.	Ná menyɛ yiye wɔ sukuu mu.
I think of it the same way	Misusuw ho saa ara
But this man told us we couldn’t leave.	Nanso saa ɔbarima yi ka kyerɛɛ yɛn sɛ yɛrentumi mfi hɔ.
I don’t know what it will be this year.	Minnim nea ɛbɛyɛ afe yi.
Quite strange, but quite true.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa, nanso ɛyɛ nokware koraa.
I had to get involved, you know	Na ɛsɛ sɛ mede me ho hyɛ mu, wunim
Everyone else did the same.	Obiara a aka no nso yɛɛ saa ara.
I still want to take a chance	Meda so ara pɛ sɛ mede hokwan bi di dwuma
Thank you very much for all your help	Meda mo ase paa wɔ mo mmoa nyinaa ho
I wonder what he wants this time.	Misusuw nea ɔpɛ saa bere yi ho.
I couldn’t handle it	Na mintumi nni ho dwuma
I love the way it feels	M’ani gye sɛnea ɛte nka no ho
I couldn’t understand why it would	Ná mintumi nte nea enti a ɛbɛyɛ saa no ase
This will actually take two people.	Eyi begye nnipa baanu ankasa.
I had nothing in it anymore	Ná me ho nni hwee wɔ mu bio
I think that’s for the best.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ nea eye sen biara.
Three days later, he was gone.	Nnansa akyi no, na onni hɔ bio.
I have no problem with the gun	Minni ɔhaw biara wɔ tuo no ho
They are in good shape.	Wɔn tebea pa mu.
And that’s part of it.	Na ɛno yɛ ne fã.
I think about him a lot today	Misusuw ne ho pii nnɛ
In a similar way.	Wɔ ɔkwan a ɛte saa ara so.
So many books.	Nhoma pii saa.
Things that really matter now.	Nneɛma a ɛho hia ankasa mprempren.
But there is more, and more every day.	Nanso pii wɔ hɔ, na ɛdɔɔso da biara da.
And that’s also my plan.	Na ɛno nso ne me nhyehyɛe.
I knew it and he knew it.	Ná minim na ɔno nso nim.
But this in itself is no good.	Nanso eyi ankasa nyɛ papa biara.
I didn’t know what was going on.	Ná minnim nea ɛrekɔ so.
I don’t want anything else	Mempɛ biribi foforo biara
Hopefully people can relate to that	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ nkurɔfo betumi de wɔn ho ahyɛ saa asɛm no mu
The dog was okay.	Ná kraman no nyɛ hwee.
Doesn’t almost everyone live there.	So ɛnyɛ ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara na ɔte hɔ.
It is not real by any means.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa ɔkwan biara so.
Maybe it will be.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I continue to remember his last days vividly	Mekɔ so kae ne nna a edi akyiri no yiye
And it’s not even why.	Na ɛnyɛ nea enti a ɛte saa mpo.
They were kids once, too.	Ná wɔyɛ mmofra bere bi, wɔn nso.
It would just be painful.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ yaw ara kwa.
I didn’t need to say much	Ná enhia sɛ meka nsɛm pii
It is now described as not.	Mprempren wɔka ho asɛm sɛ ɛnte saa.
It had come out of his head.	Ná afi ne ti mu aba.
I understand better than you know	Mete ase yiye sen sɛnea wunim
I really liked her shoes	M’ani gyee ne mpaboa ho ankasa
I knew what they had to do.	Ná minim nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Maybe he wasn’t as alone as he thought.	Ebia na ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo sɛnea na osusuw no.
There are a number of reasons for this.	Nneɛma ahorow bi nti na ɛte saa.
But be careful.	Nanso hwɛ yiye.
I still don’t understand	Meda so ara nte ase
I think about him all day	Misusuw ne ho da mũ nyinaa
You know him.	Wunim no.
And if there is, do it.	Na sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ a, yɛ.
Which is not, it is not.	Nea ɛnyɛ, ɛnte saa.
I don’t know about that.	Minnim saa asɛm no.
There was no danger in you.	Ná asiane biara nni wo mu.
It looks really interesting.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye ankasa.
But for me it was important to give something.	Nanso wɔ me fam no na ɛho hia sɛ mede biribi ma.
I need to have more fun	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye m’ani kɛse
He was easy to work with.	Ná ɛnyɛ den sɛ wo ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
This may be the same.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ saa ara.
I want to do that	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa
Finally, quantitative measurements.	Awiei koraa no, dodow a wɔde susuw nneɛma.
I can’t help him.	Mintumi mmoa no.
If they do, the police will be all over them.	Sɛ wɔyɛ saa a, polisifo no bɛba wɔn nyinaa so.
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
However, I had nothing to use now	Nanso, na minni biribiara a mede bedi dwuma mprempren
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This is not just an addition	Eyi nyɛ asɛm a wɔde bɛka ho ara kwa
It was a big deal.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse.
It will be another situation where it is too little too late.	Ɛbɛyɛ tebea foforo a ɛyɛ kakraa bi dodo aka akyi dodo.
We are on equal terms now.	Yɛwɔ nsɛm a ɛyɛ pɛ mu mprempren.
The quality is also great.	Su no nso yɛ kɛse.
I can’t handle all of this alone	Me nkutoo ntumi nni eyi nyinaa ho dwuma
I completely understand this.	Mete eyi ase koraa.
It was a girl.	Ná ɛyɛ abeawa bi.
I want him to understand if possible	Mepɛ sɛ ɔte ase sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye a
They are very interested in me	Wɔn ani gye me ho kɛse
We have so much to work with and play with now.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a yɛde bɛyɛ adwuma na yɛde adi agoru mprempren.
Easy, but not very helpful.	Ɛnyɛ den, nanso ɛnyɛ mmoa kɛse.
It looks very strange.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
There was nothing I could do.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a metumi ayɛ.
I can't see anything on the phone	Mintumi nhu biribiara wɔ telefon so
This is too easy.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw dodo.
It was a wonderful moment	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ nwonwa
Look at the people.	Hwɛ nnipa no.
The complete one is more complex.	Nea edi mũ no yɛ nea ɛyɛ den kɛse.
For another test.	Wɔ sɔhwɛ foforo ho.
That had been a very serious mistake.	Ná ɛno ayɛ mfomso kɛse paa.
Now he is one of us.	Seesei ɔyɛ yɛn mu biako.
That was a big surprise.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade kɛse a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
While he is there	Bere a ɔwɔ hɔ no .
I expect him to plan to create something	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɔbɛyɛ nhyehyɛe de abɔ biribi
This week could be more difficult.	Dapɛn yi betumi ayɛ den kɛse.
It’s not my home anymore.	Ɛnyɛ me fie bio.
They are interested in me.	Wɔn ani gye me ho.
It’s one on top of the other.	Ɛyɛ biako wɔ biako so.
We just can’t do that.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ saa ara kwa.
I am so glad I found this group	M’ani agye yiye sɛ mihuu saa kuw yi
Which is very important.	Nea ɛho hia yiye.
A few of the faces were familiar	Ná anim no mu kakraa bi nim yiye
If so, I’ll be happy	Sɛ ɛte saa a, m’ani begye
And the reason for this is that.	Na nea enti a ɛte saa ne sɛ.
The system is actually easier than it on the back end.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛ mmerɛw ankasa sen no wɔ akyi awiei.
This is what he wanted.	Eyi na na ɔpɛ.
You have two wonderful children.	Wowɔ mma baanu a wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa.
Be careful, all.	Hwɛ yiye, nyinaa.
And everyone knew.	Na obiara nim.
We were very nervous.	Na yɛn ho yɛ hu paa.
I have to head back.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede m’ani kyerɛ akyi.
And I want to tell you	Na mepɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo
This is a very difficult thing.	Eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ den yiye.
I can’t even believe this.	Mintumi nnye eyi nni mpo.
I can't figure out why.	Mintumi nhu nea enti a ɛte saa.
I saw it this afternoon	Mihuu no awia yi
I think you’ll enjoy it	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ho
Apart from you, that is.	Sɛ wo da nkyɛn a, ɛno ne.
What actually happened is something else.	Nea esii ankasa no yɛ biribi foforo bio.
Overall, it has been a good day.	Wɔ ne nyinaa mu no, ayɛ da pa.
None of them fared well.	Wɔn mu biara ankɔ yiye.
I invest in my people and their happiness	Mede sika hyɛ me nkurɔfo ne wɔn anigye mu
It will get better with time.	Ɛbɛyɛ yiye bere a bere kɔ so no.
Everything is going on.	Biribiara rekɔ so.
But not books.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nhoma ahorow.
I have done enough of that lately	Mayɛ saa a ɛdɔɔso nnansa yi
I'm a.	Meyɛ a.
I had to believe him	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ migye no di
It’s what he wants to do.	Ɛyɛ nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
There is a painful one.	Ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ yaw.
I couldn’t imagine it.	Ná mintumi nsusuw ho.
You’re very, very impressed.	W’ani gyee ho paa, paa.
It will be possible.	Ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
But the plan is the plan.	Nanso nhyehyɛe no ne nhyehyɛe no.
Maybe he was doing it wrong.	Ebia na ɔreyɛ no bɔne.
This is obviously not the case.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nte saa.
If you have something to say, say it.	Sɛ wowɔ asɛm bi ka a, ka.
He organized the work.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma no ho nhyehyɛe.
But stories can only go so far.	Nanso nsɛm betumi akɔ akyiri saa nkutoo.
I need your feedback though	Me hia wo nsɛm a wobɛka de, nanso
And it had to be that way.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I know everything, remember.	Minim biribiara, kae.
They are vulnerable.	Wɔyɛ mmerɛw.
I hope you can help me with it	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi aboa me wɔ ho
He told me that.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me saa.
I'm just heading into the day.	Mede m’ani kyerɛ da no ara kwa.
The police know that.	Polisifo nim saa.
A meeting had to be held.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nhyiam bi.
I didn’t know what to do with it	Ná minnim nea mede bɛyɛ
I wish he was here now	Me yam a anka ɔwɔ ha mprempren
His people need me.	Ne nkurɔfo hia me.
It works, and it’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ adwuma, na ɛnyɛ den koraa.
It’s an ideal situation for the police.	Ɛyɛ tebea a eye ma polisifo.
I want you two to know what's at stake	Mepɛ sɛ mo baanu hu nea ɛwɔ asɛm no mu
He had to make his move tonight.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ne tu no anadwo yi.
It was really terrifying.	Ná ɛyɛ hu ankasa.
I knew what they were	Ná minim nea wɔyɛ
Take his hand.	Fa ne nsa.
Every single day.	Da koro biara.
I sleep outside at night	Meda abɔnten anadwo
The next time it was too late.	Bere foforo mu no na aka akyi dodo.
I’m not happy at all	M’ani nnye koraa
And money, too.	Na sika nso.
I didn’t know anyone else who could help me	Ná minnim obi foforo biara a obetumi aboa me
I couldn’t add more	Na mintumi mfa pii nka ho
I need to get to know him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no.
I could visit him at any time of the day or night.	Ná metumi akɔ ne nkyɛn anadwo anaa awia bere biara.
I put it on the table	Mede sii pon no so
Maybe not in a bad way.	Ebia ɛnyɛ ɔkwan bɔne so.
I understand that too	Me nso mete saa asɛm no ase
I couldn’t do anything like that	Na mintumi nyɛ biribi a ɛte saa
Their statements are true.	Wɔn nsɛm no yɛ nokware.
You are so beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I need to see them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu wɔn.
Most things solve themselves.	Nneɛma dodow no ara ankasa di ho dwuma.
It used to be there.	Kan no na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I wonder what dad is doing	Misusuw nea papa reyɛ ho
They were imprisoned.	Wɔde wɔn too afiase.
I forgot about myself for a while	Me werɛ fii me ho kakra
I always liked him that way	Ná m’ani gye ne ho saa bere nyinaa
There is no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛte saa.
I just wanted to see how things were going	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea nneɛma rekɔ so ara kwa
She had to stay home with the kids.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne mmofra no tra fie.
Did any of us think it would.	So yɛn mu bi susuwii sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Or maybe it was just an accident.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɛyɛ akwanhyia bi kɛkɛ.
But it is really expensive.	Nanso ne bo yɛ den ankasa.
I'm glad it's you.	M'ani agye sɛ ɛyɛ wo.
They were the same thing.	Ná wɔyɛ ade koro.
They were both good people.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ nnipa pa.
This is obviously dangerous	Eyi da adi sɛ ɛyɛ asiane
It’s a mental thing.	Ɛyɛ adwene ho ade.
Lots of hot water.	Nsu a ɛyɛ hyew pii.
I want you to stay with me	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me tra
I want my power back	Mepɛ sɛ me tumi san ba bio
At the same time, he was gone.	Bere koro no ara mu no, na onni hɔ bio.
At the same time I did.	Saa bere no ara nso meyɛɛ saa.
The house is solid but not perfect.	Ofie no yɛ den nanso ɛnyɛ pɛ.
I was in a lot of pain	Ná mete yaw kɛse
The rest is relatively mundane.	Nea aka no yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw kakra.
That was a year and a half ago.	Ɛno yɛ afe ne fã a atwam ni.
There were two types at the same time.	Na ahorow abien na ɛwɔ hɔ bere koro mu.
I could make this work.	Ná metumi ama eyi ayɛ adwuma.
I couldn’t have done that	Anka mintumi nyɛ saa
I know you know what’s going on	Minim sɛ wunim nea ɛrekɔ so
I want to be your wife	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ wo yere
That can be done.	Ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye.
But it’s just a movie.	Nanso ɛyɛ sini bi kɛkɛ.
A long time ago, he might have been hopeful.	Bere tenten a atwam ni no, ebia na ɔwɔ anidaso.
His time has passed.	Ne bere atwam.
I’d love to be there, when you’re there.	M’ani begye ho sɛ mewɔ hɔ, bere a wowɔ hɔ no.
He was always the kids too.	Ná ɔyɛ mmofra no nso bere nyinaa.
His legs and feet were almost numb with cold.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na awɔw ama ne nan ne ne nan ayɛ mmerɛw.
Hope you like it!.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani gye ho!.
I wanted to know what he knew.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu nea onim.
I was out there, with them	Na mewɔ abɔnten hɔ, ne wɔn
I wonder if he is new	Misusuw sɛ ebia ɔyɛ foforo anaa
People run to him.	Nkurɔfo tu mmirika kɔ ne nkyɛn.
I’m interested in that.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
You have to live with this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne eyi tra ase.
They gave him what he wanted.	Wɔde nea na ɔpɛ maa no.
You have to keep your eyes open.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode w’ani kyerɛ.
In and out of class.	Wɔ adesua ne adesua akyi.
We can give them that.	Yebetumi ama wɔn saa.
I had the whole afternoon to myself	Na mewɔ awia no nyinaa ma me ho
I hope you all can do it	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo nyinaa betumi ayɛ
This article presents neither scenario.	Saa asɛm yi mfa tebea abien no mu biara mma.
You are cheaper, faster and stronger.	Wo bo yɛ mmerɛw, woyɛ ntɛmntɛm na woyɛ den.
I'm sorry, that's a very scary thing to say.	Mepa wo kyɛw, ɛno yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ hu yiye sɛ mɛka.
He’s got his power.	Ɔde ne tumi.
If you could do it, you did it.	Sɛ wubetumi ayɛ a, na woayɛ.
He’s a good guy to hang out with.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa a ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no bɔ.
Not terrible or anything, but good.	Ɛnyɛ hu anaa biribiara, nanso eye.
Most of them, indeed.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara, ampa.
That’s the last time.	Ɛno ne bere a etwa to.
The bus can’t move.	Bɔs no ntumi nkɔ.
I told you to do something.	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ yɛ biribi.
I wish there was another way.	Me yam a anka ɔkwan foforo bi wɔ hɔ.
Maybe I should have mentioned it.	Ebia anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka ho asɛm.
It was fast-paced.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
I wanted things to be simple	Ná mepɛ sɛ nneɛma yɛ mmerɛw
It was very quick.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛm paa.
Like, we had a lot of friends.	Te sɛ, na yɛwɔ nnamfo pii.
I still don’t hear anything.	Meda so ara nte hwee.
He didn't know what that meant anymore.	Ná onnim nea ɛno kyerɛ bio.
I wanted to check it out	Ná mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu
I saw a child without legs.	Mihuu abofra bi a onni nan.
I have to go with this one	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne eyi kɔ
If only he could get to a phone.	Sɛ anka obetumi akɔ telefon bi so a.
The next chapter.	Ti a edi hɔ no.
I am still here.	Meda so ara wɔ ha.
On my feet.	Wɔ me nan so.
Or anyone else for that matter.	Anaasɛ obi foforo biara ma saa asɛm no.
It’s what you do.	Ɛyɛ nea woyɛ.
I can move things with my mind	Metumi de m’adwene tu nneɛma
So, you have a few things to consider.	Enti, wowɔ nneɛma kakraa bi a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
The truth is that we are perfect.	Nokware no ne sɛ yɛyɛ pɛ.
I don't think so.	Misusuw sɛ ɛnte saa.
I guess it’s not where it should be though.	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ baabi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nanso.
These people often end up with problems.	Saa nnipa yi taa de ɔhaw ahorow ba awiei.
That’s just like you.	Ɛno te sɛ wo ara pɛ.
No items are included.	Nneɛma biara nka ho.
Know less, think more.	Hu kakraa bi, susuw pii ho.
Look at his eyes.	Hwɛ n’ani.
I always was, even as a kid	Ná mete saa bere nyinaa, bere a na meyɛ abofra mpo no
This is no longer ideal.	Eyi nyɛ nea eye sen biara bio.
Someone very wise once told me	Obi a onim nyansa paa ka kyerɛɛ me bere bi
That’s a lot of people involved.	Ɛno yɛ nnipa pii a wɔde wɔn ho ahyɛ mu.
If it is true, something must be done and quickly.	Sɛ ɛyɛ nokware a, ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi na wɔyɛ no ntɛm.
And it wasn’t easy.	Na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
So, this is obviously a more favorable situation.	Enti, ɛda adi sɛ eyi yɛ tebea a ɛyɛ papa kɛse.
As it had been for him, for all of them.	Sɛnea na ayɛ ama no, ama wɔn nyinaa.
Review this article and repeat the test.	Hwɛ saa asɛm yi mu na san yɛ sɔhwɛ no bio.
I hope there will be some good money.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ sika pa bi bɛba.
You used to, but now you take your problems on him.	Kan no na woyɛ saa, nanso seesei wugye no wo haw ahorow no.
And right now is not the time.	Na mprempren yi ara nyɛ bere no.
I just tell him how it is.	Meka kyerɛ no sɛnea ɛte ara kwa.
I can’t understand what the problem is.	Me ntumi nte nea ɔhaw no yɛ ase.
I have done this for him	Mayɛ no eyi
A meeting took place	Nhyiam bi kɔɔ so
It was already happening.	Ná ɛrekɔ so dedaw.
It is still ahead of our time.	Ɛda so ara di yɛn bere yi anim.
It was good to be home.	Ná eye sɛ yɛwɔ fie.
No one knows his name.	Obiara nnim ne din.
I really wish he was here now	Me yam a anka ɔwɔ ha mprempren ankasa
One thing a day, another another.	Ade biako da koro, ade foforo foforo.
But this seems a bit complicated to me.	Nanso eyi te sɛ nea ɛyɛ den kakra ma me.
I told our people.	Meka kyerɛɛ yɛn nkurɔfo.
I could give you a job	Ná metumi ama wo adwuma
And everything seemed to be going well.	Na na ɛte sɛ nea biribiara akɔ so yiye.
I look away from him	Mede m’ani m’ani fi ne ho
My dad told me to do this.	Me papa ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ menyɛ eyi.
He didn’t have any.	Ná onni bi.
I don’t know what else you can expect.	Minnim nea wubetumi ahwɛ kwan bio.
I didn’t even want to think about him	Ná mempɛ sɛ misusuw ne ho mpo
And sorry for what happened.	Na kyɛw wɔ nea esii no ho.
Or almost as good.	Anaasɛ ɛkame ayɛ sɛ eye saa ara.
Maybe it would have worked this evening.	Ebia anka ɛbɛyɛ adwuma anwummere yi.
This is from me.	Eyi fi me.
Maybe you can get something else from him.	Ebia wubetumi anya biribi foforo afi ne hɔ.
I still think that’s true.	Meda so ara susuw sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
I also think people said	Misusuw nso sɛ nkurɔfo kae
Three photos on each sheet.	Mfonini abiɛsa wɔ krataa biara so.
I hoped he had no one else with him	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ onni obi foforo ka ne ho
A man with a lot of money	Ɔbarima bi a ɔwɔ sika pii
It doesn’t matter much now.	Ɛho nhia pii mprempren.
I want you to take me home with you	Mepɛ sɛ wode me kɔ fie ka wo ho
I have to feel for what it looks like	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete nka wɔ sɛnea ɛte no ho
Apparently I am a handful	Ɛda adi sɛ meyɛ nsa kakraa bi
It will be good.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa.
But even that can be dangerous.	Nanso ɛno mpo betumi ayɛ asiane.
I was trusted with it.	Wɔde me ho too so.
At least it used to be.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, kan no na ɛte saa.
I’m interested in children.	M’ani gye mmofra ho.
I didn’t really care.	Ná ɛnyɛ me asɛm ankasa.
But not the end for him.	Nanso ɛnyɛ awiei no mma no.
I still wanted her to be my wife	Ná meda so ara pɛ sɛ ɔyɛ me yere
But it is not true.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nokware.
But it looks better than it actually is.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea eye sen sɛnea ɛte ankasa.
You win, all right.	Wo di nkonim, ɛyɛ.
That didn’t go over too well.	Ɛno ankɔ so yiye dodo.
I had high hopes	Ná mewɔ anidaso kɛse
A man's sword.	Ɔbarima bi.
I didn’t want to do this to you	Na mempɛ sɛ meyɛ wo saa ade yi
And this is obviously for a reason.	Na ɛda adi sɛ biribi nti na eyi te saa.
I thought you’d like it	Misusuwii sɛ w’ani begye ho
Put it back on.	Fa to hɔ bio.
That is no longer a joke.	Ɛno nyɛ agoru bio.
I know what they have to do	Minim nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ
I know exactly what you mean	Minim nea wopɛ sɛ woka no yiye
He was a great guy.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse.
I really just wanted to get to you	Na mepɛ sɛ mekɔ wo nkyɛn kɛkɛ ankasa
But this is only a necessary condition.	Nanso eyi yɛ tebea a ɛho hia ara kwa.
I really don’t know.	Ankasa minnim.
Deal with that issue.	Di saa asɛm no ho dwuma.
I take him to her.	Mede no kɔ ne nkyɛn.
I don’t like that look in her eyes.	M’ani nnye saa hwɛ a ɔde hwɛ n’ani so no ho.
Whatever it is, just say it.	Nea ɛyɛ biara no, ka kɛkɛ.
It was not big enough.	Ná ɛnyɛ kɛse sɛnea ɛsɛ.
That might solve the problem.	Ebia ɛno bedi ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
This course was harder than the previous ones.	Ná adesua yi yɛ den sen nea atwam no.
I'm on you.	Mewɔ wo so.
But he knew it was my turn to give him things.	Nanso na onim sɛ ɛyɛ m’ani sɛ mede nneɛma bɛma no.
I can try to help them	Metumi abɔ mmɔden aboa wɔn
It’s here and now.	Ɛwɔ ha ne mprempren.
Many people describe themselves this way.	Nnipa pii ka wɔn ho asɛm saa kwan yi so.
I can’t keep up these days.	Mintumi nkɔ so nna yi.
It's all been a bit much for him.	Ne nyinaa ayɛ pii kakra ama no.
I wanted to do anything for him	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribiara ma no
I look into his eyes	Mehwɛ n’ani so
This is not just me.	Eyi nyɛ me nkutoo.
It sounds terrible.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
Could you please tell me how to do that.	Mesrɛ wo, wubetumi aka sɛnea mɛyɛ saa akyerɛ me.
I am a very nice and pretty girl	Meyɛ abeawa a me ho yɛ fɛ yiye na me ho yɛ fɛ
I really wish it were	Me yam a anka ɛte saa ampa
It’s like most games.	Ɛte sɛ agoru dodow no ara.
Which might have been true.	Nea ebia na ɛyɛ nokware.
He is a wonderful character.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
He stepped closer to her.	Ɔde ne nan bɛn no.
It’s not easy.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
I have to take care of my friends	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ me nnamfo
A terrible thought struck me	Adwene a ɛyɛ hu bi bɔɔ me
He sticks his head in it.	Ɔde ne ti hyɛ mu.
I couldn’t figure out where the games were, either	Na mintumi nhu baabi a agoru ahorow no wɔ, nso
You know what you forget.	Wunim nea wo werɛ fi.
I have it just like him	Mewɔ bi te sɛ ɔno ara pɛ
But first, you have to do something for me.	Nanso nea edi kan no, ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribi ma me.
He does the same thing.	Ɔno nso yɛ ade koro no ara.
And it’s the truth, too.	Na ɛyɛ nokware no nso.
Maybe it’s a good one.	Ebia ɛyɛ papa.
I need to talk to you about something important.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa fa biribi a ɛho hia ho.
I want to go to everyone	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ obiara nkyɛn
She is my wife.	Ɔyɛ me yere.
That’s your nature.	Ɛno ne wo su.
I was strong enough.	Ná me ho yɛ den.
I put everything on the table.	Mede biribiara too pon no so.
I really like it here	M’ani gye ho ankasa wɔ ha
You can’t really do their job.	Worentumi nyɛ wɔn adwuma ankasa.
I used to be one of them once	Kan no na meyɛ wɔn mu biako bere bi
Even the beautiful ones.	Nea ɛyɛ fɛ mpo.
I hope you might enjoy it	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ebia w’ani begye ho
A good party, that is	Apontow pa, kyerɛ sɛ
I have had that for some time now	Mewɔ saa bere bi ni
You know him well.	Wunim no yiye.
He had done it himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa na wayɛ.
I used to have one like that	Kan no na mewɔ bi a ɛte saa
As we should be doing.	Sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ no.
I didn’t know why my feet had taken me there	Na minnim nea enti a me nan de me akɔ hɔ
Make that what you want.	Fa ɛno nyɛ nea wopɛ.
Maybe I can help you with that	Ebia metumi aboa wo wɔ saa asɛm no ho
Sleep and sleep.	Nna ne nna.
These things.	Saa nneɛma yi.
I really didn’t want to be here anymore	Ankasa na mempɛ sɛ mewɔ ha bio
It’s so painful for me.	Ɛyɛ me yaw paa.
So keep things interesting.	Enti ma nneɛma nkɔ so nyɛ anigye.
He didn't want to hear from me.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔte me asɛm.
It was a wonderful idea.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It was extremely rare.	Ná ɛho yɛ na koraa.
I know it wasn’t.	Minim sɛ na ɛnte saa.
I just didn't know what to do	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ ara kwa
It shouldn’t be surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It was really good.	Ná eye ankasa.
And you had to know where you were.	Na na ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu baabi a wowɔ.
Who does that.	Hena na ɔyɛ saa.
I have to go to school	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ sukuu
It’s what you’re for.	Ɛyɛ nea wowɔ ho ma.
I don’t think that’s what’s happening.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛno ne nea ɛrekɔ so.
After all, the information was always there.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na nsɛm no wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
It was a half-full picture.	Ná ɛyɛ mfonini a fã ahyɛ mu ma.
I know it’s me	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ me
In the former case.	Wɔ kan no mu.
I knew you were on the wrong path	Ná minim sɛ wowɔ ɔkwan bɔne so
And at least it’s something to do.	Na anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Offer any help you can.	Fa mmoa biara a wubetumi ama.
He has no rights.	Onni hokwan biara.
I see it going away	Mihu sɛ ɛrekɔ
I know what’s going on here.	Minim nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha.
But it’s just words.	Nanso ɛyɛ nsɛm ara kwa.
And that’s what it is.	Na ɛno ne saa.
You’re with me, so no problem.	Wo ne me wɔ hɔ, enti ɔhaw biara nni ho.
There is not enough room in my house for it all.	Baabi a ɛdɔɔso nni me fie mma ne nyinaa.
It was something of an adventure.	Ná ɛyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu.
I look forward to my next book	Mehwɛ me nhoma a edi hɔ no kwan
And yet, he wasn’t.	Na nanso, na ɔnyɛ saa.
I have to go to this school	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ sukuu yi
He did not know this man.	Ná onnim saa ɔbarima yi.
He’s interesting, and he’s a completely different style.	Ɔyɛ anigye, na ɔyɛ ɔkwan foforo koraa so.
I can’t believe it	Mintumi nnye nni
I was shocked to be alive.	Me ho dwiriw me sɛ mete ase.
It had been a great first time for us.	Ná ayɛ bere a edi kan kɛse ama yɛn.
What you had to do.	Nea na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
He does that absolutely.	Ɔyɛ saa koraa.
He was so strong.	Ná ne ho yɛ den saa.
I just had an idea but it’s too soon	Me nyaa adwene bi kɛkɛ nanso ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo
Children themselves	Mmofra ankasa .
I got your favorite meal.	Me nsa kaa wo aduan a w’ani gye ho paa.
This is not a walking party.	Eyi nyɛ apontow a wɔde nantew.
I know about him.	Minim ne ho asɛm.
It seemed important.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛho hia.
However, most of us tend to go with the latter.	Nanso, yɛn mu dodow no ara taa ne nea etwa to no kɔ.
It’s just a temporary one.	Ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi kɛkɛ.
I found it in this book	Mihuu no wɔ nhoma yi mu
I wanted to look a little closer	Ná mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ no yiye kakra
He knew their names.	Ná onim wɔn din.
I have to do this alone	Ɛsɛ sɛ me nkutoo na meyɛ eyi
At least for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, me fam no.
That was a good time and a bad time.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere pa ne bere bɔne.
I’d be very interested in that.	M’ani begye saa asɛm no ho yiye.
I hadn't been able to sleep in days	Ná nna pii ni a mintumi nna mu
That means the time is now.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ bere no adu mprempren.
I like them the best	M’ani gye wɔn ho sen biara
Something was going on.	Ná biribi rekɔ so.
In any case, you have forgotten something.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, wo werɛ afi biribi.
I want to lie there for a while longer	Mepɛ sɛ meda hɔ kakra bio
People like me.	Nkurɔfo te sɛ me.
I have to live with him right now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no tra mprempren ara.
You’ve done it right.	Woayɛ no yiye.
But there are so many things the kids have to do.	Nanso nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra no yɛ.
I realized what was happening to me	Mihuu nea na ɛrekɔ so wɔ me ho
But it was none of these things.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ saa nneɛma yi mu biara.
That’s a quality, too.	Ɛno nso su.
I'm with my son.	Me ne me ba no.
We had to bring in new people to make things really happen.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde nnipa foforo ba sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a nneɛma bɛba ankasa.
I have no idea how this thing works	Minni sɛnea ade yi yɛ adwuma no ho adwene biara
The man has a presence	Ɔbarima no wɔ baabi a ɔwɔ
Thank you to them.	Meda wɔn ase.
It would have been that easy, too.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw saa, nso.
And stay awesome!.	Na tra ase yɛ hu!.
He participated in the testing.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ sɔhwɛ no yɛ mu.
He is obviously great.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔyɛ kɛse.
I knew what the man looked like	Ná minim sɛnea ɔbarima no te
I have to tell you now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo mprempren.
It doesn’t surprise me.	Ɛnyɛ me nwonwa.
I think we were both scared	Misusuw sɛ na yɛn baanu nyinaa suro
I expected so much	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɛdɔɔso saa
It doesn’t hurt me.	Ɛnyɛ me yaw.
It’s still here.	Ɛda so ara wɔ ha.
His books feature his picture on the cover.	Ne nhoma ahorow no de ne mfonini kyerɛ wɔ anim.
I want to do something bigger	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi kɛse
We hope you enjoy it.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho.
I didn’t have to say anything	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ meka biribiara
We have a lot to offer anyone like that.	Yɛwɔ pii a yɛde bɛma obiara a ɛte saa.
I stare at him incomprehensibly.	Mehwɛ no denneennen a mintumi nte ase.
And it wasn’t surprising.	Na ɛnyɛ nwonwa.
When it’s all over, it will be all the rest.	Sɛ ne nyinaa ba awiei a, ɛbɛyɛ nea aka nyinaa.
I can’t imagine how great it is	Mintumi nsusuw sɛnea ɛyɛ kɛse no ho
This worked well.	Eyi yɛɛ adwuma yiye.
Not a bad idea.	Ɛnyɛ adwene bɔne.
That’s something you do well.	Ɛno yɛ biribi a woyɛ no yiye.
You are a human being just like me.	Woyɛ onipa te sɛ me ara pɛ.
He didn't want to belong.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ne de.
I really like the way it looks	M’ani gye sɛnea ɛte no ho ankasa
It seemed to be one.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ biako.
I would be beautiful.	Anka mɛyɛ fɛ.
I knew what you were doing	Ná minim nea woreyɛ
I need to figure out how to go about it	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea mɛkɔ so ayɛ saa
So everything, in other words.	Enti biribiara, wɔ ɔkwan foforo so no.
I can do something for you	Metumi ayɛ biribi ama wo
I’m absolutely thrilled	M’ani gyee ho koraa
The system is alive and well.	Nhyehyɛe no te ase na ɛyɛ yiye.
I felt it was too soon to say	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo sɛ mɛka
You’re not doing well.	Wonyɛ yiye.
Animals are easy.	Mmoa yɛ mmerɛw.
Return as soon as possible.	San kɔ ntɛm ara sɛnea yebetumi.
At least two of them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔn mu abien.
I had never thought about that	Ná minsusuw saa asɛm no ho da
I think in their own way they did	Misusuw sɛ wɔ wɔn ankasa kwan so yɛɛ saa
I tell people that all the time	Meka saa kyerɛ nkurɔfo bere nyinaa
Which was the last thing he wanted.	Nea na ɛyɛ ade a etwa to a na ɔpɛ.
Could he have seen me?!.	So anka obetumi ahu me?!.
I absolutely loved this story	Ná m’ani gye saa asɛm yi ho koraa
Which I just couldn’t do anything about	Nea na mintumi nyɛ ho hwee kɛkɛ
You are completely busy.	Wowɔ adagyew koraa.
I wanted him to be me	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ me ho
But this is not very easy.	Nanso eyi nyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
You could only have one.	Ná biako pɛ na wubetumi anya.
Maybe it was the case.	Ebia na ɛte saa.
Do what you have to do.	Yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
You don’t even want to think that.	Wompɛ sɛ wususuw saa mpo.
What is surprising is just how good it is	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ne sɛnea eye no ara kwa
I totally forgot to tell you	Me werɛ fii koraa sɛ mɛka akyerɛ wo
This should not happen.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi ba.
I’m very happy with the news.	M’ani agye yiye wɔ asɛm no ho.
But still can drive and enjoy it.	Nanso da so ara tumi ka kar na n’ani gye ho.
I hope you join me now	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo nso wobɛka me ho mprempren
And on him, too.	Na ne so nso.
Start now.	Fi ase mprempren.
I don’t have a job.	Minni adwuma.
It’s just something they put your hand through everything.	Ɛyɛ biribi a wɔde wo nsa fa biribiara mu kɛkɛ.
It doesn’t seem optimal.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nea eye sen biara.
I didn’t want to hear his speeches	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete ne kasa ahorow no
Have fun, my legs.	Momma mo ani nnye, me nan.
I enjoyed going there	M’ani gyee ho sɛ mɛkɔ hɔ
I wish you were here	Me yam a anka wowɔ ha
There is nothing more important	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛho hia sen saa
He’s the one who owns it.	Ɔno na ɔwɔ bi.
I saw something strange	Mihuu biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa
No mistake, nothing.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ, biribiara nni hɔ.
I hope he is there	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ
It seems to have power.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ tumi.
I have to be someone like that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ obi a ɔte saa.
We are very good friends.	Yɛyɛ nnamfo pa yiye.
So take advantage of this opportunity while you can.	Enti fa hokwan yi di dwuma bere a wubetumi no.
You have to tell me one of yours.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka wo de no biako kyerɛ me.
I tell him everything.	Meka biribiara kyerɛ no.
He is just late.	Ɔka akyi ara kwa.
I can say those things	Metumi aka saa nneɛma no
So that’s what was going on.	Enti saa na na ɛrekɔ so.
He didn’t have much money.	Na onni sika pii.
However, we can draw an important conclusion.	Nanso, yebetumi de asɛm bi a ɛho hia aba awiei.
I missed your coldness	Me werɛ fii wo awɔw no
His new wife had me.	Ná ne yere foforo no wɔ me.
I didn't even know it at all until now.	Ná minnim koraa mpo de besi nnɛ.
These people are my friends.	Saa nkurɔfo yi yɛ me nnamfo.
I didn’t even know the man himself	Ná minnim ɔbarima no ankasa mpo
I don’t know where my father was	Minnim baabi a na me papa wɔ
I never knew his name.	Na minnim ne din da.
I should have been more careful	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani da hɔ kɛse
This is not possible.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Maybe it would work.	Ebia na ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
It’s a front line.	Ɛyɛ anim kwan.
His focus, and his creation.	N’adwene a ɔde sii so, ne ne ho a ɔde bɔɔ no.
We both do that.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa yɛ saa.
Stay close to him.	Tra ase bɛn no.
I recognized it immediately	Mihuu no ntɛm ara
He was here early.	Ná ɔwɔ ha ntɛm.
I knew every one of them	Ná minim wɔn mu biara
I just want to be alone for a while	Mepɛ sɛ me nkutoo tra hɔ kakra kɛkɛ
Power is power.	Tumi yɛ tumi.
I am pretty sure about that.	Migye di yiye wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
It’s not just us.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn kɛkɛ.
I always wondered what you saw in him	Bere nyinaa na misusuw nea wuhu wɔ ne ho no ho
There is no night, only day.	Anadwo biara nni hɔ, awia nkutoo.
I hope we can both do that	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa betumi ayɛ saa
The film is important for a number of reasons.	Nneɛma ahorow bi nti na sini no ho hia.
I know this situation	Minim tebea yi
', it was '.	', na ɛyɛ '.
It should be pretty easy for the first few hours.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye wɔ nnɔnhwerew a edi kan no mu.
The group just ate what they liked	Kuw no dii nea wɔn ani gye ho ara kwa
He was doing his best.	Ná ɔreyɛ nea obetumi biara.
I had made it so easy with my mistakes	Ná mede me mfomso ahorow no ama ayɛ mmerɛw saa
I saw a picture of someone	Mihuu obi ho mfonini
He had many friends and was well liked.	Ná ɔwɔ nnamfo pii na na nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho yiye.
You are too new to this.	Woyɛ foforo dodo wɔ eyi ho.
But people can see them.	Nanso nkurɔfo betumi ahu wɔn.
I have to tell the user that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka saa kyerɛ nea ɔde di dwuma no.
I saw a few people from school	Mihuu nnipa kakraa bi fii sukuu mu
Or maybe no one cared.	Anaasɛ ebia na obiara mfa ne ho.
It’s all just me.	Ne nyinaa yɛ me nkutoo.
As you know this is very dangerous.	Sɛnea wunim no eyi yɛ asiane kɛse.
My name was still far below the name.	Ná me din da so ara wɔ din no ase koraa.
I focused on work	Mede m’adwene sii adwuma so
I forgot all about it.	Me werɛ fii ne nyinaa.
He’s interested in that.	N’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
What has happened is now in the past.	Nea asi no, atwam mprempren.
I did the same thing about it.	Meyɛɛ ho saa ara.
This was far past.	Ná eyi atwam koraa.
There is give, and there is take.	Ma wɔ hɔ, na fa nso wɔ hɔ.
He has to put in a lot of effort.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden kɛse.
And that’s nothing at all.	Na ɛno nso nyɛ hwee koraa.
It just wasn’t their best moment in time.	Na ɛnyɛ wɔn bere a eye sen biara wɔ bere mu ara kwa.
Give them plenty of water and do not touch them.	Ma wɔn nsu pii na mfa wɔn nsa nka wɔn.
And it was there.	Na ɛwɔ hɔ.
That should worry everyone.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ma obiara haw.
The good kids, not the bad ones.	Mmofra pa no, ɛnyɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ bɔne no.
Here’s my opinion.	M’adwene ni.
I wonder what there is a thing for	Misusuw sɛ dɛn na ade bi wɔ hɔ ma ho
I think we have one.	Misusuw sɛ yɛwɔ bi.
I need to get to know him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no.
he thought about it.	osusuw ho.
This is up to you.	Eyi wɔ wo so.
And dinner time too.	Na anwummere aduan bere nso.
You don’t have to live with what used to be.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode nea na ɛte kan no tra ase.
I had to take care of my son this time.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ me ba saa bere yi.
As you can see.	Sɛnea wuhu no.
I am really, really great.	Meyɛ kɛse ankasa, ankasa.
He’s happy.	N’ani begye.
I want you and me everything	Mepɛ wo ne me biribiara
I have to do that one day	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa da bi
Remember he will be gone for a week, maybe longer.	Kae sɛ ɔbɛkɔ dapɛn biako, ebia akyɛ sen saa.
I already know what you all say about me	Minim nea mo nyinaa ka fa me ho dedaw
I just received them last week	Me nsa kaa wɔn dapɛn a etwaam no ara pɛ
No one mentioned the matter	Obiara anka asɛm no ho asɛm
I hope you have done well	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ woayɛ no yiye
I’m glad you liked the book.	M’ani agye sɛ w’ani gyee nhoma no ho.
I guess it had to be sooner or later	Misusuw sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛm anaa akyiri yi
This was his apartment.	Ná eyi ne ne dan a ɔte mu.
I can handle my stuff	Metumi adi me nneɛma ho dwuma
I've already joined yours	Mede me ho ahyɛ wo de no mu dedaw
I should have told him	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no
But it is very easy to use.	Nanso ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
I knew his name, but he didn’t	Ná minim ne din, nanso na onnim saa
Very, very good.	Eye paa, paa.
How it all goes.	Sɛnea ne nyinaa kɔ so.
Several had recently arrived.	Ná dodow bi aba nnansa yi ara.
I’m more interested in doing experiments	M’ani gye ho kɛse sɛ mɛyɛ sɔhwɛ ahorow
Let’s not forget.	Yɛn werɛ mfi.
This seems important.	Eyi te sɛ nea ɛho hia.
Like someone else.	Te sɛ obi.
We could have done more.	Ná yebetumi ayɛ pii.
I wasn't planning on doing this	Ná ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mɛyɛ eyi
In his hair.	Wɔ ne ti nhwi mu.
I signed it back	Mede me nsa hyɛɛ ase de san maa no
I am really looking forward to next weekend	Mehwɛ dapɛn awiei a edi hɔ no kwan ankasa
I don't really know how that's going to work yet.	Minnim sɛnea ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma ankasa de besi nnɛ.
I can’t compare him to anyone else	Mintumi ne obi foforo nsusuw ne ho
Maybe this will work.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ adwuma.
They all knew each other.	Ná wɔn nyinaa nim wɔn ho wɔn ho.
I will make it a habit.	Mede bɛyɛ me su.
It may not even be true.	Ebia ɛnyɛ nokware mpo.
I almost believed it	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na migye di sɛ ɛte saa
Besides, he didn't really have anything to say.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, na onni asɛm biara a ɔbɛka ankasa.
There are no words.	Nsɛm biara nni hɔ.
He really liked that.	Ná n’ani gye saa asɛm no ho ankasa.
I saw this as an opportunity	Mihuu eyi sɛ hokwan
I was doing even better	Ná mereyɛ no yiye mpo
I had a lot of friends	Ná mewɔ nnamfo pii
Your kids are even more amazing than that meal was.	Wo mma no yɛ nwonwa mpo sen sɛnea na saa aduan no te.
I know that fact.	Minim saa asɛm no.
I was a monster to him	Ná meyɛ aboa kɛse ma no
This is pretty amazing.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa yiye.
I think they will be very interested	Misusuw sɛ wɔn ani begye ho kɛse
Not any of those things.	Ɛnyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara.
I can’t say the words	Mintumi nka nsɛm no
I kept my eyes on him	Mede m’ani sii ne so
I don’t like it, or him	M’ani nnye ho, anaa ɔno
But this time, really focused on the book.	Nanso saa bere yi ara, de n’adwene sii nhoma no so ankasa.
I couldn’t go to school	Ná mintumi nkɔ sukuu
For now, though, it’s the best option we have.	Nanso, mprempren, ɛyɛ ɔkwan a eye sen biara a yɛwɔ.
Something had brought them here.	Ná biribi de wɔn aba ha.
Now that it is too late.	Seesei a aka akyi dodo no.
But one man always knew how the story would end.	Nanso na ɔbarima biako nim sɛnea asɛm no bɛba awiei bere nyinaa.
I understand how he feels	Mete sɛnea ɔte nka no ase
I thought you were in town.	Misusuwii sɛ wowɔ kurow no mu.
But another surprise.	Nanso ade foforo a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I couldn’t figure out why	Na mintumi nhu nea enti a ɛte saa
And all of that is becoming very sophisticated.	Na saa nneɛma no nyinaa reyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
But I can’t make it work.	Nanso mintumi mma ɛnyɛ adwuma.
It was a strong hand.	Ná ɛyɛ nsa a ɛyɛ den.
Otherwise, we have what we have.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, yɛwɔ nea yɛwɔ.
I want it to be amazing	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa
It just works so well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye ara kwa.
There’s a lot of background there.	Nneɛma pii wɔ akyi wɔ hɔ.
Behind the scenes, it is very successful.	Wɔ akyi no, edi yiye kɛse.
I wasn't upset about it or anything	Ná ɛnyɛ me yaw wɔ ho anaa biribiara ho
But there are all the same.	Nanso ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
I didn’t even really know who or what she was	Ná minnim onii anaa nea ɔyɛ mpo ankasa
Something seems innocent	Biribi te sɛ nea ɛho nni asɛm
But the story kept happening.	Nanso asɛm no kɔɔ so sii.
I don’t have a headache	Minni ti a ɛyɛ me yaw
This goes for both my mom and dad.	Eyi kɔ ma me maame ne me papa nyinaa.
I should have known.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
He was very much like me.	Ná ɔte sɛ me paa.
Another power.	Tumi foforo bi.
I’m interested in you.	Wo ho yɛ me anigye.
It’s not too complicated.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den dodo.
I’m really enjoying it	M’ani gye ho ankasa
However, some things are the same.	Nanso, nneɛma bi yɛ ade koro.
I don’t know where it is.	Minnim baabi a ɛwɔ.
He knew they worked.	Ná onim sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma.
I still remember what he looked like	Meda so ara kae sɛnea na ɔte no
I think we need to use it now	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde di dwuma mprempren
That is the next step.	Ɛno ne ade a edi hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Whether it worked or not didn’t matter.	Sɛ́ ɛyɛ adwuma anaasɛ ɛnte saa no, na ɛho nhia.
I did it to save my people	Meyɛɛ saa de gyee me nkurɔfo nkwa
However, it didn’t.	Nanso, anyɛ saa.
As they should be done.	Sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no.
I had forgotten that everyone was there with us	Ná me werɛ afi sɛ obiara ka yɛn ho wɔ hɔ
Whether there is a will or not.	Sɛ́ ebia ɔpɛ wɔ hɔ anaasɛ ɔmpɛ no.
That was absolutely certain.	Ná ɛno yɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware koraa.
I didn’t know where to go.	Ná minnim baabi a mɛkɔ.
So much more expensive.	Enti ne bo yɛ den sen saa.
I hear she looks really nice	Mete sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa
So, it’s not.	Enti, ɛnyɛ saa.
That was a lot of fun.	Ná ɛno yɛ anigye kɛse.
I love these things.	M'ani gye saa nneɛma yi ho.
However, he would be strong.	Nanso, na ɔbɛyɛ den.
I know what you want to do	Minim nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ
Just like everyone else does.	Sɛnea obiara yɛ no.
Take it all back	Fa no nyinaa san kɔ
Think about that.	Susuw saa asɛm no ho hwɛ.
I wasn't going to get better	Ná ɛnyɛ sɛ me ho bɛtɔ me
It’s just as simple as that.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ ɛno ara pɛ.
I don’t think he’ll like it.	Minsusuw sɛ n’ani begye ho.
You may have done it right.	Ebia woayɛ no yiye.
In other words, it’s gorgeous.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
This look has a lot going for it.	Saa hwɛ yi wɔ pii kɔ ma no.
I quickly headed to my car	Meyɛɛ ntɛm de m’ani kyerɛɛ me kar no
It always is, and always will be.	Ɛte saa bere nyinaa, na ɛbɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
I know brilliant people who behave in a similar way	Minim nnipa a wɔn ho akokwaw a wɔyɛ wɔn ade wɔ ɔkwan a ɛte saa ara so
I don’t want that for anyone	Mempɛ saa mma obiara
Was he doing that.	So na ɔreyɛ saa.
Let me smile at you.	Ma m’ani nnye ho.
At least most of them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔn mu dodow no ara.
There are a few you have to do.	Kakraa bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I thought she was beautiful	Misusuwii sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ
Not as far as I know.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea minim no.
I have this leg pain since quite some time.	Mewɔ nan mu yaw yi fi bere tenten bi.
I think this is a new first for me	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ ade foforo a edi kan ma me
He evidently did in this case.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa wɔ asɛm yi mu.
It’s not just fun.	Ɛnyɛ anigye ara kwa.
Maybe I should go	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ
I couldn’t do anything.	Na mintumi nyɛ hwee.
We were put down.	Wɔde yɛn sii fam.
I was a different person	Ná meyɛ onipa foforo
Only the best.	Nea eye sen biara nkutoo.
There is only one problem.	Ɔhaw biako pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
And he joined them, too.	Na ɔno nso kaa wɔn ho.
As long as the book does it.	Bere tenten a nhoma no na ɛyɛ no.
It was too new.	Ná ɛyɛ foforo dodo.
The city is still working.	Kurow no da so ara yɛ adwuma.
Too good to be true.	Ɛyɛ papa dodo sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nokware.
I shouldn't have involved you	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mede wo ho hyɛ mu
It’s all full, and it’s all come true.	Ne nyinaa ayɛ ma, na ne nyinaa aba mu.
As such, their work is critical.	Sɛnea ɛte no, wɔn adwuma no ho hia kɛse.
Make sure you feel comfortable.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
I look at them and see myself	Mehwɛ wɔn na mihu me ho
Nothing is happening.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛrekɔ so.
But it should be common knowledge.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea obiara nim.
I'll give it to him.	Mede bɛma no.
I just want to thank you again.	Mepɛ sɛ meda mo ase bio kɛkɛ.
He is quite happy with this though.	Ɔwɔ anigye koraa wɔ eyi ho nanso.
However, it is still possible.	Nanso, ɛda so ara yɛ yiye.
He brings me to life.	Ɔde me ba nkwa mu.
I really feel strong	Mete nka ankasa sɛ me ho yɛ den
It’s hot this month, no question about that.	Ɛyɛ hyew ɔsram yi, asɛm biara nni ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I want to do some good things	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nneɛma pa bi
That was the original plan.	Ná ɛno ne nhyehyɛe a edi kan no.
I couldn’t figure out why	Ná mintumi nsusuw nea enti a ɛte saa no ho
However, time is a major problem.	Nanso, bere yɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
I have a lot of it.	Mewɔ pii.
The same goes for products.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nneɛma a wɔyɛ ho.
I do a job now that I love	Meyɛ adwuma bi mprempren a m’ani gye ho
The early years can be very difficult.	Mfe a edi kan no betumi ayɛ den yiye.
Everyone is so strong	Obiara ho yɛ den saa
I'm sorry I'm wrong	Mepa wo kyɛw sɛ meyɛ bɔne
He was an instant success.	Ná odi yiye ntɛm ara.
I'll give you that	Mede saa bɛma wo
Money is not the issue.	Ɛnyɛ sika ne asɛm no.
I'll give you to you	Mede wo bɛma wo
I need to know what’s going on	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so
He wanted only the best for me.	Ná ɔpɛ nea eye sen biara nkutoo ma me.
However, it doesn’t work somehow.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ adwuma ɔkwan bi so.
It feels like it is.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛte saa.
I know you can do well	Minim sɛ wubetumi ayɛ yiye
But now he seems very weak.	Nanso mprempren ɛte sɛ nea wayɛ mmerɛw yiye.
I will use it for another project.	Mede bedi dwuma ama adwuma foforo.
So was my mother.	Saa ara na na me maame nso te.
And so have they, too.	Na saa ara na wɔn nso ayɛ.
He seemed happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
Perhaps, his son.	Ebia, ne ba no.
He did the same thing.	Ɔyɛɛ saa ara.
Use everything you know to make it work.	Fa biribiara a wunim di dwuma ma ɛnyɛ yiye.
That made me feel a little better.	Ɛno maa me ho tɔɔ me kakra.
We had to do it over and over again	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ no mpɛn pii
At the time, everything was going well for him.	Saa bere no, na biribiara rekɔ yiye ama no.
I wanted to do it for the very first time	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ no bere a edi kan koraa
I wanted people to understand.	Ná mepɛ sɛ nkurɔfo te ase.
If it’s a mistake it’s a mistake.	Sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso a ɛyɛ mfomso.
For me, it was just a learning process.	Wɔ me fam no, na ɛyɛ adesua nhyehyɛe ara kwa.
Everyone talks about doing it.	Obiara ka sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ho asɛm.
Still sitting on the floor.	Da so ara te fam.
I have no idea why he is here	Minnim nea enti a ɔwɔ ha no ho adwene biara
I have no plans.	Minni nhyehyɛe biara.
I have a place in the city	Mewɔ baabi wɔ kurow no mu
That for me is the end.	Ɛno ma me ne awiei no.
I should have told you last night too	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo anadwo a etwaam no nso
Take it down, my mother ordered my father.	Fa no kɔ fam, me maame hyɛɛ me papa.
I needed to know maybe	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛ ebia
It’s been a long time.	Ɛyɛ bere tenten ni.
There were many people there.	Ná nnipa pii wɔ hɔ.
But you’re not that great.	Nanso wonyɛ kɛse saa.
I still couldn’t see anything	Ná meda so ara ntumi nhu biribi
So look around this room.	Enti hwɛ dan yi mu nyinaa.
A lot, obviously.	Pii, ɛda adi.
I really had no reason to be there	Ankasa na minni biribiara a enti ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ
No one said anything to me.	Obiara anka hwee ankyerɛ me.
Eventually, he becomes the first victim	Awiei koraa no, ɔbɛyɛ nea odi kan a ɔyɛ no bɔne
I had no idea about it.	Ná minni ho adwene biara.
It had some human error.	Ná ɛwɔ nnipa mfomso bi.
I didn't want to apologize	Ná mempɛ sɛ mepa no kyɛw
There was only time for one thing.	Ná bere wɔ hɔ ma ade biako pɛ.
Finally, they got the message.	Awiei koraa no, wɔn nsa kaa asɛm no.
I hear something now too	Mete biribi mprempren nso
I lived through it all	Mede ne nyinaa traa ase
I love the plot and the variety of characters	M’ani gye asɛm no mu nsɛm ne nnipa ahorow ahorow a wɔka ho asɛm no ho
A new song has been added	Wɔde dwom foforo bi aka ho
Part of him desperately wanted it to.	Ná ne fã bi pɛ denneennen sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
And things are heading in that direction here too.	Na nneɛma rekɔ saa kwan no so wɔ ha nso.
This happens if you have a time management problem.	Eyi ba sɛ wowɔ bere mu nhyehyɛe mu ɔhaw bi a.
I am participating in this study	Mede me ho hyɛ adesua yi mu
I expect this from you	Mehwɛ eyi kwan fi mo hɔ
Something wasn’t working.	Ná biribi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
That’s what one can create.	Ɛno na obi betumi abɔ.
A factual statement.	Asɛm a ɛyɛ nokware.
That has never been more apparent.	Ɛno nyɛɛ nea ɛda adi kɛse da.
My hands are very strong.	Me nsa ano yɛ den yiye.
I have three reasons	Mewɔ nneɛma abiɛsa nti
He liked his new self.	N’ani gyee ne ho foforo no ho.
I can do this, he told himself	Metumi ayɛ eyi, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho
I think you all remember the story	Misusuw sɛ mo nyinaa kae asɛm no
But this is not really true.	Nanso eyi nyɛ nokware ankasa.
Maybe he should tell someone.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ obi.
I could go on for hours.	Ná metumi akɔ so nnɔnhwerew pii.
His words, not mine.	Ne nsɛm, ɛnyɛ me de.
We indulge in the love of music.	Yɛde yɛn ho hyɛ nnwom ho anigye mu.
No one knew that better than she and her children.	Ná obiara nnim saa asɛm no yiye sen ɔne ne mma.
At least one a week.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, biako dapɛn biara.
That has been going on for two days.	Ɛno akɔ so nna abien ni.
I hung up the phone	Mede telefon no too fam
It was exciting at the time.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye wɔ saa bere no mu.
He was very independent, very happy.	Ná ɔde ne ho kɛse, na n’ani agye yiye.
So, they are the same situation.	Enti, wɔyɛ tebea koro no ara.
I can’t let him out, not here	Mintumi mma no mfi adi, ɛnyɛ ha
They shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I work until lunch.	Meyɛ adwuma kosi awia aduan.
I think we will work on it	Misusuw sɛ yɛbɛyɛ ho adwuma
All of this took hours.	Ná eyi nyinaa gye nnɔnhwerew pii.
I nodded only this time	Mede me ti too fam saa bere yi nkutoo
Their job is difficult.	Wɔn adwuma yɛ den.
It’s such a day.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛte saa.
I find that it does.	Mihu sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I can't seem to see it	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nhu
The two still seemed very close.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔn baanu no da so ara bɛn wɔn ho kɛse.
I wish he would talk about these things again.	Me yam a anka ɔbɛka saa nneɛma yi ho asɛm bio.
We are here to do the latter.	Yɛwɔ ha sɛ yɛbɛyɛ nea etwa to no.
I know what the things are	Minim nea nneɛma no yɛ
I knew you meant well	Ná minim sɛ wopɛ sɛ woka yiye
There was nothing remarkable about that.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I felt vulnerable but, at the same time, powerful	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ mmerɛw nanso, bere koro no ara mu no, na mewɔ tumi
I want to look just as good.	Mepɛ sɛ me ho yɛ fɛ saa ara.
It’s very hard to do that.	Ɛyɛ den yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
It wasn’t a movie, but it would have been a great one.	Na ɛnyɛ sini, nanso anka ɛbɛyɛ sini kɛse.
And he was	Na ɔyɛ .
I was excited about it.	Ná m’ani agye ho.
Tell me what you think about that.	Ka nea wususuw wɔ saa asɛm no ho kyerɛ me.
I had to work.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma.
I made that picture.	Meyɛɛ saa mfonini no.
At least for now.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, mprempren de.
He tells himself that.	Ɔka kyerɛ ne ho sɛ.
I could have that with him	Ná metumi anya saa wɔ ne nkyɛn
Other than that, he felt what I felt.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, na ɔte nka sɛ me nso mete nka.
They never play with me	Wɔn ne me nni agoru da
Not like himself.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa.
I have to think things through	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw nneɛma ho yiye
Clearly, that is no longer the case.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ saa bio.
There are different things here.	Nneɛma ahorow wɔ ha.
I heard that song before.	Metee saa dwom no pɛn.
I can't get it to work anyway yet.	Mintumi mma ɛnyɛ adwuma ɔkwan biara so de besi nnɛ.
I was very surprised	Me ho dwiriw me kɛse
I forget to tell you this	Me werɛ fi sɛ mɛka eyi akyerɛ wo
This is where the error begins.	Eyi ne baabi a mfomso no fi ase.
I didn’t know anyone else	Ná minnim onipa foforo biara
I wanted to get to know him better	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu no yiye
This whole year has been amazing	Afe yi nyinaa ayɛ nwonwa
It was something that anyone could do.	Ná ɛyɛ biribi a obiara betumi ayɛ.
The girl does that.	Abeawa no yɛ saa.
I could have controlled myself better.	Anka metumi adi me ho so yiye.
He is a master of the art.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho akokwaw.
I know him behind the scenes.	Minim no wɔ akyi.
Someone who has something to say.	Obi a ɔwɔ asɛm bi ka.
He knew what it was.	Ná onim nea ɛyɛ.
He wrapped his arms around her.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne mu.
I need you in though	Me hia wo wɔ mu nanso
Can you.	So wubetumi.
He will do it soon.	Ɔbɛyɛ nnansa yi ara.
But that has to come later.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ba akyiri yi.
The boy can do anything.	Abarimaa no tumi yɛ biribiara.
I had no idea why this was	Ná minnim nea enti a eyi te saa
Maybe a dress.	Ebia atade bi.
You want both.	Wopɛ abien no nyinaa.
You would be perfect for him.	Anka wobɛyɛ pɛ ama no.
I was no longer a child	Ná menyɛ abofra bio
Maybe that’s the same thing.	Ebia ɛno nso te saa ara.
You know what he wanted.	Wunim nea na ɔpɛ.
You don’t understand me at all.	Wo nte me ase koraa.
At least for a little while.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, da kakra.
I think you have to believe it.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wugye di.
It doesn’t work very well.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma yiye koraa.
But he knew it.	Nanso na onim.
I care more than you know	Me ho hia me sen sɛnea wunim
I have a right to know	Mewɔ hokwan sɛ mihu
Busy, busy, busy.	Adagyew, adagyew, adagyew.
And that’s why we do what we do right?!.	Na ɛno nti na yɛyɛ nea yɛyɛ no ɛnte saa?!.
I didn't know if he heard me	Ná minnim sɛ ebia ɔte me anaa
I had to bring him into me.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede no ba me mu.
The other two could be anyone I guess.	Nnipa baanu a aka no betumi ayɛ obiara a misusuw sɛ.
It is no longer human.	Ɛnyɛ bio onipa.
I had to say sorry to him	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ mepa wo kyɛw kyerɛ no
I think he is now	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ mprempren
Something that needs to be done.	Biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Say three days.	Ka sɛ nnansa.
And not in a good way, either.	Na ɛnyɛ ɔkwan pa so, nso.
He didn't know his part.	Ná onnim ne fã no.
If the game goes well.	Sɛ agoru no kɔ yiye a.
It will be cold.	Ɛbɛyɛ awɔw.
I'm about my own.	Meyɛ me de no ho.
Maybe he could do that now.	Ebia na obetumi ayɛ saa mprempren.
He was very impressed.	N’ani gyee ho kɛse.
I want this more than anything	Mepɛ eyi sen biribiara
Maybe this could go somewhere.	Ebia eyi betumi akɔ baabi.
You put in the hours.	Wode nnɔnhwerew no ahyɛ mu.
You know this.	Wunim eyi.
Similarly, we have	Saa ara nso na yɛwɔ .
They are strong.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ den.
There is nothing you have to do.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I would have told me that	Anka mɛka saa akyerɛ me
However, he can tell you more.	Nanso, obetumi aka nneɛma pii akyerɛ wo.
I want to tell you a few things	Mepɛ sɛ meka nsɛm kakraa bi kyerɛ wo
Keep working on that.	Kɔ so yɛ saa asɛm no ho adwuma.
He is quite young.	Ɔyɛ abofra koraa.
Confess your sins.	Ka wo bɔne kyerɛ.
House from home.	Fie fi fie.
He can do more.	Obetumi ayɛ pii.
It’s not nearly as hard as you think.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ den sɛnea wususuw no.
I didn’t know he existed	Ná minnim sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ
And so the day was set.	Na saa na wɔde da no sii hɔ.
I can do nothing for you today	Mintumi nyɛ hwee mma wo nnɛ
There are a few.	Kakraa bi wɔ hɔ.
I've done that	Mayɛ saa
It was very large.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse paa.
It’s not the case.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte.
Even that had gone too far.	Ná ɛno mpo akɔ akyiri dodo.
Do whatever you have to do.	Yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biara.
But there are other things he can do.	Nanso nneɛma foforo wɔ hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
Even then, you never know.	Ɛno mpo no, wunnim da.
The first is jobs.	Nea edi kan ne nnwuma.
This is easily described with a word.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wɔde asɛm bi bɛka eyi ho asɛm.
Add more water if necessary.	Sɛ ɛho hia a, fa nsu pii ka ho.
I want to feel that way.	Mepɛ sɛ mete nka saa.
I wonder if, at one time, my mother knew him	Misusuw ho sɛ ebia, bere bi, na me maame nim no anaa
A boy who worked in our stable	Abarimaa bi a na ɔyɛ adwuma wɔ yɛn mmoa dan mu
Imagine how quickly that happened.	Susuw sɛnea ɛno sii ntɛmntɛm no ho hwɛ.
It has caused them to forget the more important things	Ama wɔn werɛ afi nneɛma a ɛho hia kɛse
After that, it would all be over.	Ɛno akyi no, na ne nyinaa bɛba awiei.
What he had done.	Nea na wayɛ no.
I love being with him	M’ani gye ho sɛ me ne no bɛbɔ
I never want to go down again.	Mempɛ sɛ mɛkɔ ase bio da.
I've been wanting to tell you that for some time.	Mepɛ sɛ meka saa kyerɛ wo bere bi ni.
A man watches from his window.	Ɔbarima bi fi ne mfɛnsere mu hwɛ.
But for me that’s not my problem.	Nanso me fam no ɛnyɛ me haw ne no.
The picture is of the real thing.	Mfonini no yɛ ade ankasa de.
He's not worse than that.	Ɔnyɛ bɔne sen saa.
Maybe it’s true.	Ebia ɛyɛ nokware.
It’s not pretty or glamorous.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ anaasɛ ɛyɛ fɛ.
I'm lying there.	Meda hɔ.
I did so immediately.	Meyɛɛ saa ntɛm ara.
I didn’t really know the truth.	Ná minnim nokware ankasa.
But this was just a party.	Nanso na eyi yɛ apontow bi kɛkɛ.
I would greatly appreciate some help.	M’ani begye mmoa bi ho kɛse.
I was outside.	Ná mewɔ abɔnten.
I didn’t really think so	Na minsusuw saa ankasa
I could never imagine that.	Na mintumi nsusuw saa da.
My room is a disaster.	Me dan no yɛ asiane.
I wish we all stayed with them	Me yam a anka yɛn nyinaa traa wɔn nkyɛn
I am still in control, as you say.	Meda so ara di tumi, sɛnea woka no.
It is neither good nor bad.	Ɛnyɛ papa anaa bɔne biara.
I plan to add more, maybe more	Meyɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mede pii bɛka ho, ebia pii
They are only used sparingly.	Wɔde di dwuma kakraa bi nkutoo.
Look at that below.	Hwɛ ɛno ase.
And you might actually like them!.	Na ebia w’ani begye wɔn ho ankasa!.
If you can tell.	Sɛ wubetumi aka a.
The meetings are short.	Nhyiam ahorow no yɛ tiaa.
It had to be him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno.
You can do the work.	Wubetumi ayɛ adwuma.
At least on my first night.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ me anadwo a edi kan no.
I really thought it was you	Misusuwii ankasa sɛ ɛyɛ wo
I could use another gun	Ná metumi de tuo foforo adi dwuma
I have included both below.	Mede abien no nyinaa aka ho wɔ ase ha.
Everyone has a past.	Obiara wɔ nea atwam.
Not too late, not too soon.	Ɛnyɛ akyiri dodo, ɛnyɛ ntɛm dodo.
I live on the floor below	Mete fam a ɛwɔ ase hɔ no so
He told her to smile.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no.
There is no more study.	Adesua nni hɔ bio.
Of course, it certainly must be.	Ampa, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
I think he's doing really well	Misusuw sɛ ɔreyɛ yiye ankasa
I want to be with him	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no tra
He had to figure it all out for himself.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa susuw ne nyinaa ho.
His hands.	Ne nsa.
A beautiful furry animal.	Aboa a ne ho yɛ fɛ a ne ho yɛ nhwi.
I need to know what happens next	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea edi hɔ
I had almost forgotten about it	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na me werɛ afi ho asɛm
I keep going on and on.	Mekɔ so kɔ so.
So much of this information.	Enti saa nsɛm yi pii.
Or for any other reason.	Anaasɛ biribi foforo biara nti.
I should have brought it already	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mede ba dedaw
I have to be thankful	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda ase
A lot happens by accident.	Pii ba wɔ akwanhyia mu.
I know all about these things	Minim saa nneɛma yi ho nsɛm nyinaa
I quickly picked up the phone	Meyɛɛ ntɛm faa telefon no
That was his day job.	Ná ɛno ne ne da no mu adwuma.
That’s a terrible idea.	Ɛno yɛ adwene bi a ɛyɛ hu.
I have every right to	Mewɔ hokwan biara sɛ
A pleasant day.	Da a ɛyɛ anigye.
I couldn’t believe this	Ná mintumi nnye eyi nni
This is a good thing in most situations.	Eyi yɛ ade pa wɔ tebea dodow no ara mu.
I think it works well now.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma yiye mprempren.
Very simple stuff.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
They were pretty good.	Ná wɔyɛ papa yiye.
This is another true enough situation.	Eyi ne nokware tebea foforo a ɛdɔɔso.
This method is relatively inexpensive.	Saa kwan yi bo nyɛ den koraa.
My mind follows suit.	M’adwene di akyi.
But no one could find them.	Nanso obiara antumi anhu wɔn.
Have fun while you can.	Gye w’ani bere a wubetumi no.
I love your hair.	M’ani gye wo ti nhwi ho.
The present moment is so close.	Mprempren bere yi bɛn saa.
Go back to the house.	San kɔ fie.
Their stay was brief	Wɔn tra no yɛɛ bere tiaa bi
I love these kids.	M’ani gye mmofra yi ho.
I can try and work there	Metumi abɔ mmɔden na mayɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ
I can reach that, relatively easily	Metumi adu saa, a ɛnyɛ den koraa
Much longer, indeed	Pii tenten sen saa, ampa
There is no more of them.	Wɔn ho asɛm biara nni hɔ bio.
However, most do not.	Nanso, dodow no ara nyɛ saa.
I hope they are happy.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wɔn ani begye.
I just wish there was someone else	Me yam a anka obi foforo wɔ hɔ ara kwa
I know what it was now	Minim nea na ɛte mprempren
Maybe he will do that.	Ebia ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I was doing well too	Ná me nso mereyɛ yiye
After a while he didn’t even know what he looked like.	Bere bi akyi no na onnim sɛnea ɔte mpo.
I can show you there.	Metumi akyerɛ wo wɔ hɔ.
Another man takes the leg.	Ɔbarima foforo nso fa nan no.
I saw a path that was a path	Mihuu ɔkwan bi a na ɛyɛ ɔkwan
From here he could look out over the park.	Ná obetumi afi ha ahwɛ abɔnten so.
People want something big.	Nkurɔfo pɛ ade kɛse bi.
Or maybe he has.	Anaasɛ ebia wayɛ saa.
You didn’t really have to	Ná enhia sɛ woyɛ saa ankasa
But it is often difficult.	Nanso ɛyɛ den mpɛn pii.
I think we both had an idea of ​​what might be in it.	Misusuw sɛ na yɛn baanu nyinaa wɔ adwene bi wɔ nea ebia ɛwɔ mu no ho.
A good time so far.	Bere pa a wɔde besi nnɛ.
I thought it was better than that	Misusuwii sɛ eye sen saa
And he would do it too.	Na ɔno nso bɛyɛ.
It solves a lot of problems, it’s that simple.	Edi ɔhaw pii ho dwuma, ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa.
The two of us.	Yɛn baanu no.
I couldn't tell if he was alive or not	Ná mintumi nhu sɛ ɔte ase anaasɛ ɔte ase
I'm anything but fine so far.	Meyɛ biribiara nanso yiye de besi nnɛ.
I think more people need to deal with it.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ nnipa pii di ho dwuma.
I guess it doesn’t really matter anymore	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee ankasa bio
Become a new person.	Yɛ onipa foforo.
I just know that he did	Minim ara ne sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa
It was for us to be strong.	Na ɛyɛ ma yɛn sɛ yɛn ho yɛ den.
I could do some things	Ná metumi ayɛ nneɛma bi
That wasn’t me.	Ná ɛnyɛ me na ɛno ne no.
But it’s not enough.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
He liked himself for thinking.	N’ani gyee ne ho sɛ osusuw ho.
Water was an issue.	Ná nsu yɛ asɛm.
Hence the cost.	Enti na ɛho ka no.
I want everything now	Mepɛ biribiara mprempren
Take food on time.	Fa aduan wɔ bere ano.
I actually did, indeed	Meyɛɛ saa ankasa, ampa
I don't know if that's a problem.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno yɛ ɔhaw anaa.
And he was doing that.	Na na ɔyɛ saa.
Certainly not the police.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ polisifo no.
I know him better than anyone	Minim no yiye sen obiara
But why this has happened.	Nanso nea enti a eyi aba.
However, the seemingly daunting timing of the project is not.	Nanso, adwuma no bere a ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu no nyɛ saa.
In other words, it handles it well.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, edi ho dwuma yiye.
I want to apologize for that	Mepɛ sɛ mepa kyɛw wɔ saa asɛm no ho
People just seem to deal with it.	Ɛte sɛ nea nkurɔfo di ho dwuma ara kwa.
I have to think like them	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw nneɛma ho te sɛ wɔn
I still don't say anything	Meda so ara nka hwee
I should have taken it with me	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mede kɔ
Everything just seems to take longer on this phone.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara gye bere tenten kɛkɛ wɔ telefon yi so.
I nod, looking at myself in the water as well	Mede me ti to fam, na mehwɛ me ho wɔ nsu no mu nso
I painted something beautiful and interesting	Meyɛɛ biribi a ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ anigye ho mfonini
He was such a good guy.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa a ɔte saa.
It is the present chapter.	Ɛyɛ mprempren ti no.
I think it was me too	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ me nso
No human being can.	Onipa biara nni hɔ a obetumi.
I couldn’t figure out what the problem could be	Na mintumi nhu nea ɔhaw no betumi ayɛ
But it was happening.	Nanso na ɛrekɔ so.
No one was ever supposed to say it.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara ka da.
That would be pretty awesome.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ hu yiye.
You can add more later if needed.	Wubetumi de pii aka ho akyiri yi sɛ ɛho hia a.
He was a handful when he was younger.	Ná ɔyɛ nsa kakraa bi bere a na ɔyɛ abofra no.
I’m obviously excited about that	Ɛda adi sɛ m’ani agye saa asɛm no ho
This was an exciting project.	Ná eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ anigye.
I still had the problem.	Ná meda so ara wɔ ɔhaw no.
Please say it's okay for me to do this.	Mesrɛ wo ka sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee sɛ mɛyɛ eyi.
They had signed it.	Ná wɔde wɔn nsa ahyɛ ase.
And look closely at those wonderful hands of his.	Na hwɛ saa ne nsa a ɛyɛ nwonwa no yiye.
I admit, this is a strange story	Migye tom sɛ, eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa
And that is how it should be from now on.	Na saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fi seesei rekɔ.
So that was awesome.	Enti na ɛno yɛ hu.
I think there used to be	Misusuw sɛ kan no na ɛwɔ hɔ
However, it is by no means a surprise.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa ɔkwan biara so.
I just couldn’t take it anymore	Na mintumi nnye bio kɛkɛ
You can do what you want with them.	Wubetumi de wɔn ayɛ nea wopɛ.
I wish more people would do this.	Me yam a anka nnipa pii bɛyɛ eyi.
And such statements.	Na nsɛm a ɛte saa.
Food for thought.	Aduan a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho.
For my father, it was the latter.	Wɔ me papa fam no, na ɛyɛ nea etwa to no.
That’s where many of them excel.	Ɛno ne baabi a wɔn mu pii yɛ adwuma yiye wɔ.
But I’m not.	Nanso me deɛ.
But there was nothing he could do about that.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
What he does, they do.	Nea ɔyɛ no, wɔyɛ.
I see it more often now.	Mihu no mpɛn pii mprempren.
Lots of uncomfortable people.	Nnipa pii a wɔn ho nnye wɔn ho.
The whole day had been a great one.	Ná da mũ no nyinaa ayɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
Live each day for whatever it is.	Tra ase da biara da ma biribiara a ɛbɛyɛ.
That was a month ago.	Ɛno yɛ ɔsram biako a atwam ni.
I wanted to be like him	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ sɛ ɔno
I wonder who that could be	Misusuw sɛ hena na ɛno betumi ayɛ
We all have our likes and dislikes.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ nneɛma a yɛn ani gye ho na yɛn ani nnye ho.
There are many pictures.	Mfonini ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
It seems more difficult to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den kɛse ma me.
I don’t know the names of anyone who lives on our street.	Minnim obiara a ɔte yɛn abɔnten so din.
I didn’t want to say anything	Ná mempɛ sɛ meka hwee
However, there is still something wrong.	Nanso, biribi bɔne bi da so ara wɔ hɔ.
I only know him by good name	Din pa nkutoo na minim no
This can only be done if we all speak up.	Sɛ yɛn nyinaa kasa a, ɛno nkutoo na yebetumi ayɛ eyi.
I didn’t want to go any further with him, until now	Na mempɛ sɛ me ne no bɛkɔ akyiri, de besi nnɛ
You don’t quite know how to do it.	Wunnim sɛnea wobɛyɛ no yiye.
That’s what it was supposed to be.	Saa na na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
There are many possibilities.	Nneɛma pii betumi aba saa.
But this time he did something else.	Nanso saa bere yi de, ɔyɛɛ biribi foforo.
Assume everything is in a ground state.	Fa no sɛ biribiara wɔ tebea a ɛwɔ fam mu.
He certainly didn't need to tell anyone now.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na enhia sɛ ɔka kyerɛ obiara mprempren.
Therefore, we have	Enti, yɛwɔ .
Thus, the situation is unclear.	Enti, tebea no mu nna hɔ.
Look at that now.	Hwɛ saa asɛm no mprempren.
And it was very, very good.	Na eye paa paa.
I don’t know why, but it was.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa, nanso na ɛte saa.
I might have already done it	Ebia na mayɛ dedaw
It should have been implemented immediately	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma ntɛm ara
It’s not a sin.	Ɛnyɛ bɔne.
He is the only one you will associate with.	Ɔno nkutoo na wo ne no bɛbɔ.
I just want to talk to him again	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa bio kɛkɛ
This is a generalization.	Eyi yɛ asɛm a wɔka no nyinaa.
I felt wrong all over myself	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ mfomso wɔ me ho nyinaa
Not really, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ ankasa, ɔkwan biara so.
I find this fascinating	Mihu sɛ eyi yɛ anigye
At least play hard every game.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, di agoru denneennen wɔ agoru biara mu.
Fortunately, there is better.	Nea eye ne sɛ, nea eye sen saa wɔ hɔ.
I have some work to do here	Mewɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ wɔ ha
Not in the same thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade koro no ara mu.
I know what it sounds like, but it’s true	Minim sɛnea ɛte, nanso ɛyɛ nokware
Gave.	Ma a.
I love what we do	M’ani gye nea yɛyɛ no ho
It was very exciting.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
And he certainly is.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔte saa.
This person is included.	Saa onipa yi ka ho.
No comments or anything.	Nsɛm a wɔka anaa biribiara nni hɔ.
You can’t make it happen.	Worentumi mma ɛnyɛ yiye.
But this is more important.	Nanso eyi ho hia kɛse.
I am artificial intelligence	Meyɛ nyansa a wɔde nsa ayɛ
It was cold last year.	Ná awɔw wom afe a etwaam no.
See what our policy says.	Hwɛ nea yɛn nhyehyɛe no ka.
But they did touch me.	Nanso wɔde wɔn nsa kaa me ampa.
I think about him all the time.	Misusuw ne ho bere nyinaa.
He knew he had no chance.	Ná onim sɛ onni hokwan biara.
Something happened to him.	Biribi too no.
I was completely under his control	Ná mewɔ ne tumi ase koraa
There are never enough hours in the day.	Nnɔnhwerew a ɛdɔɔso da wɔ da no mu.
However, he enjoyed it.	Nanso, n’ani gyee ho.
That would be very difficult.	Ɛno bɛyɛ den yiye.
That would be about the first of the year.	Ɛno bɛyɛ bɛyɛ afe no mu da a edi kan.
And the most beautiful house.	Na ofie a ɛyɛ fɛ sen biara.
I felt so much better now	Me ho tɔɔ me kɛse mprempren
I can do a lot with names	Metumi de din ayɛ pii
You’re like him.	Wo te sɛ ɔno.
I know you know this.	Minim sɛ wunim eyi.
He has a good time.	Ɔwɔ no bere pa.
I believe you have done as you said you would.	Migye di sɛ woayɛ sɛnea wokae sɛ wobɛyɛ no.
Nobody makes you do anything.	Obiara mma wonyɛ hwee.
One job per person, per year.	Adwuma biako a obiara yɛ, afe biara.
I didn’t need to know anymore	Ná enhia sɛ mihu bio
People see them and forget about them.	Nkurɔfo hu wɔn na wɔn werɛ fi.
I know he knows	Minim sɛ onim
It doesn’t matter what people do to him.	Nea nkurɔfo bɛyɛ no no mfa ho.
It’s not fun at all.	Ɛnyɛ anigye koraa.
He should have done something before it got to this.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi ansa na adu eyi mu.
And my clothes, too.	Na me ntade nso.
I might as well be honest.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mɛka nokware saa ara.
But many did.	Nanso na pii yɛ saa.
These photos are not available anywhere else.	Saa mfonini ahorow yi nni baabi foforo biara.
It’s how you think about it all.	Ɛyɛ sɛnea wususuw ne nyinaa ho.
That approach has worked so far.	Saa kwan no ayɛ adwuma de besi nnɛ.
This is my name on the door.	Eyi ne me din wɔ ɔpon no so.
The things are the same.	Nneɛma no yɛ ade koro.
I didn’t want to make a habit out of it	Ná mempɛ sɛ mede bɛyɛ su bi
The fresher the food the better.	Dodow a aduan no yɛ foforo no dodow no ara na eye.
I am the same way.	Me nso mete saa.
He had the power to do so.	Ná ɔwɔ tumi a ɔde bɛyɛ saa.
Maybe he didn’t know anything.	Ebia na onnim hwee.
It’s easy to do.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ wobɛyɛ.
You have one, too.	Wo nso wowɔ bi.
I have a lot to sit on.	Mewɔ pii a mete so.
They are given to the children.	Wɔde ma mmofra no.
I want you to do my will	Mepɛ sɛ woyɛ me pɛ
So, stay tuned for all the latest updates.	Enti, tra ase hwɛ nsɛm foforo a aba foforo nyinaa.
I might be a little late	Ebia mɛka akyi kakra
But that will be difficult.	Nanso ɛno bɛyɛ den.
I can’t figure out where the week went.	Me ntumi nhu baabi a dapɛn no kɔɔ.
Have fun with the rest of the year.	Wo ne afe no mu fã a aka no gye w’ani.
Not often, but the opportunity is there.	Ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii, nanso hokwan no wɔ hɔ.
I feel great now though	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ kɛse mprempren de, nanso
I need to know something	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu biribi
No one ever made me feel that way.	Obiara amma metee nka saa da.
I better get in there	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ mekɔ mu wɔ hɔ
You can see where it is on the picture.	Wubetumi ahu baabi a ɛwɔ mfonini no so.
I can tell you this, though	Nanso, metumi aka eyi akyerɛ wo
I don’t think that’s the case.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛte saa.
And the city, too.	Na kurow no nso.
It must have hurt, what he was doing.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ yaw, nea na ɔreyɛ no.
The important things.	Nneɛma a ɛho hia.
I loved every moment of it	M’ani gyee bere biara a ɛwɔ mu no ho
I took him away from me	Mede no fii me ho
I think this might be one of your best plans	Misusuw sɛ ebia eyi bɛyɛ wo nhyehyɛe a eye sen biara no mu biako
I was very much there.	Ná mewɔ hɔ paa.
However, it’s not as easy as it sounds.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛte no.
I have to tell people	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ nkurɔfo
It feels unreal.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛnyɛ nokware.
That sounds pretty good.	Ɛno te sɛ nea eye paa.
I look forward to playing with him.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ me ne no bedi agoru.
I guess three isn’t too bad	Misusuw sɛ abiɛsa nyɛ bɔne dodo
Many people think so.	Nnipa pii susuw saa.
I love being with you	M’ani gye ho sɛ me ne wo bɛbɔ
So, a lot to do.	Enti, pii a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
I can sneak out today and maybe tomorrow altogether	Metumi awia me ho akɔ nnɛ ne ebia ɔkyena koraa
I am very pleased with your services.	M’ani agye yiye wɔ mo nnwuma ho.
It will be something like below.	Ɛbɛyɛ biribi te sɛ ase hɔ.
I know him very well.	Minim no yiye.
I’m only glad to see you here	M’ani gye sɛ mihu wo wɔ ha nkutoo
Everything he liked.	Biribiara a na n’ani gye ho.
This looks really amazing.	Eyi hwɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
And maybe that’s the point.	Na ebia ɛno ne asɛm no.
So this is important, if true.	Enti eyi ho hia, sɛ ɛyɛ nokware a.
He didn't know what time it was.	Ná onnim bere a ɛyɛ.
I wondered what was going on	Misusuw nea ɛrekɔ so ho
The danger creates a situation in which you must cooperate.	Asiane no de tebea bi ba a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biako wɔ mu.
I wonder what they are made of.	Misusuw nea wɔde yɛ ho.
I don’t like it at all	M’ani nnye ho koraa
I should have thought about it.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
It has to be that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I had no time for mistakes	Ná minni bere mma mfomso ahorow
I admit, you did have me with that one	Migye tom sɛ, na wowɔ me ne saa biako no ampa
A good news story.	Asɛm pa bi.
I had no idea about him, really	Ná minni ne ho adwene biara, ampa
I can’t even like him	Mintumi mpo m’ani nnye ne ho
And he felt the same way.	Na ɔno nso tee nka saa ara.
I love going to work.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛkɔ adwuma.
So we do even.	Enti yɛyɛ mpo.
I was outside the prison	Ná meda afiase no akyi
He was well aware of that.	Ná onim saa asɛm no yiye.
A very impressive picture.	Mfonini a ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
And we enjoyed it.	Na yɛn ani gye ho.
Can he make the play when he needs it too.	So obetumi ayɛ agoru no bere a ɔno nso hia no.
I would know very few of them	Anka wɔn mu kakraa bi pɛ na minim
It may only be offered for a limited time.	Ebia wɔde bɛma bere tiaa bi nkutoo.
I wanted to say that.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka saa.
I didn’t know how many	Ná minnim dodow ahe
Not much later on.	Ɛnyɛ pii akyiri yi.
But there are other factors to consider.	Nanso nneɛma foforo wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
I am not doing this.	Ɛnyɛ me na mereyɛ eyi.
I know what it is for sure	Minim nea ɛyɛ ampa
But tomorrow is harder.	Nanso ɔkyena de no yɛ den sen saa.
I was worried about my mother	Ná me maame ho asɛm haw me
It was all going so well.	Ná ne nyinaa rekɔ yiye saa.
I have to believe in something	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye biribi di
Everyone happily got a job.	Obiara de anigye nyaa adwuma.
I couldn’t do any of those things	Ná mintumi nyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara
It’s a wonderful story, isn’t it?.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa, ɛnte saa?.
It’s not for everyone, but that’s the point.	Ɛnyɛ obiara de, nanso ɛno ne asɛm no.
I certainly do that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ meyɛ saa.
Something should have been done.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi.
This movie doesn’t have them.	Saa sini yi nni wɔn.
It was a long time ago.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
There may have been more.	Ebia na pii wɔ hɔ.
I can't believe he really has to be mine	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ me de ankasa
I just want to go home now	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ fie mprempren ara kwa
I want you to be happy for me	Mepɛ sɛ w’ani gye ma me
Everything points to that.	Biribiara kyerɛ saa.
There is no danger to you.	Asiane biara nni hɔ mma wo.
Or at least it was in the past.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte saa bere bi a atwam no.
I really, really like them	M’ani gye wɔn ho ankasa, ankasa
It’s been like that for a while really.	Ɛte saa bere tiaa bi ankasa.
I always check how the team is doing too	Bere nyinaa mehwɛ sɛnea kuw no nso reyɛ
I couldn’t use my power over him like that	Na mintumi mfa me tumi nni dwuma wɔ ne so saa
This is not the end.	Eyi nyɛ awiei no.
The story is still very relevant	Asɛm no da so ara fa ho kɛse
I like where this is going	M’ani gye baabi a eyi rekɔ no ho
On and off the field they were a force.	Wɔ abɔnten so ne abɔnten no na wɔyɛ tumi kɛse.
That was something new for me.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade foforo ma me.
Only one of the two will.	Nnipa baanu no mu biako pɛ na ɛbɛyɛ saa.
He didn't want this to happen.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ eyi bɛba.
Not at all, and certainly not alone.	Ɛnyɛ koraa, na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ ne nkutoo.
That’s one of them.	Ɛno ne biako.
The people were very close.	Ná nkurɔfo no bɛn wɔn ho kɛse.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Mfomso biara nni eyi ho.
There was still hope.	Ná anidaso da so ara wɔ hɔ.
I want to hear good news.	Mepɛ sɛ mete nsɛm pa.
the power is still there.	tumi no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
I'm pretty sure they love it as much as we do.	Migye di yiye sɛ wɔn ani gye ho sɛnea yɛn ani gye ho no.
I need to know these things	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu saa nneɛma yi
He was terrible.	Ná ne ho yɛ hu.
Not a bad name, really.	Ɛnyɛ din bɔne, ampa.
It’s just not true.	Ɛnyɛ nokware kɛkɛ.
I really want to feel something, anything	Mepɛ paa sɛ mete biribi nka, biribiara
I saw them through the window in the back	Mihuu wɔn wɔ mfɛnsere no mu wɔ akyi hɔ
Give them space and be nice.	Ma wɔn baabi na wo ho nyɛ fɛ.
Plan a day in advance.	Yɛ da koro ho nhyehyɛe di kan.
He is in the group.	Ɔwɔ kuw no mu.
I can give them a fortnight	Metumi ama wɔn dapɛn abien
We were supposed to, but no one really did.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa, nanso obiara anyɛ saa ankasa.
There was nothing you could do about it.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
But the system is completely out of control.	Nanso nhyehyɛe no nni so koraa.
I always tell him how it is	Meka kyerɛ no sɛnea ɛte bere nyinaa
I never even think about it.	Minsusuw ho mpo da.
This had been going on for a long time.	Ná eyi akɔ so akyɛ.
You should do the same.	Wo nso ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I don't know what to do with that.	Minnim nea mɛyɛ wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
Please.	Mesrɛ wo.
He did a lot of good things.	Ɔyɛɛ nneɛma pa pii.
It’s hard for me.	Ɛyɛ den ma me.
I knew this would be dangerous.	Ná minim sɛ asiane bɛba eyi mu.
I wish we had.	Me yam a anka yɛwɔ.
I am outside, not part of it anymore.	Mewɔ abɔnten, ɛnyɛ ne fã bio.
That’s a little late.	Ɛno aka akyi kakra.
This team makes a couple of mistakes.	Saa kuw yi di mfomso abien bi.
I know it was my fault	Minim sɛ na ɛyɛ me mfomso
Start doing something new.	Fi ase yɛ biribi foforo.
Not in the last few years.	Ɛnyɛ mfe kakraa a atwam no mu.
I know how that feels too.	Minim sɛnea ɛno nso te nka.
I am the only one who works well.	Me nkutoo na meyɛ adwuma yiye.
I didn’t go with him.	Me ne no ankɔ.
All in all, really good.	Ne nyinaa mu no, eye ankasa.
I know this is very simple, please guide me.	Minim sɛ eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye, mesrɛ wo, kyerɛ me kwan.
I was filled with joy	Anigye hyɛɛ me ma
I didn’t know anything very well	Ná minnim hwee yiye
I leaned closer to him	Mede me ho too ne nkyɛn kɛse
No such system currently exists.	Nhyehyɛe a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ mprempren.
I just want to see you	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wo ara kwa
This is obviously not the case.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi nte saa.
I'm sure part of it was too	Migye di sɛ na ne fã bi nso te saa
He thought about that and nodded again.	Osusuw saa asɛm no ho na ɔde ne ti too fam bio.
That gave two of them.	Ɛno maa wɔn mu baanu.
He wasn’t doing anything wrong.	Ná ɔnyɛ bɔne biara.
The bed was absolutely comfortable and the room was very comfortable.	Na mpa no yɛ fɛ koraa na na dan no mu yɛ fɛ yiye.
It’s how we all know what he looks like.	Ɛyɛ sɛnea yɛn nyinaa nim sɛnea ɔte.
That might have been perfectly possible at the time.	Ebia na ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye koraa saa bere no.
I don’t know if he can	Minnim sɛ ebia obetumi anaa
He has two police officers outside his house day and night.	Ɔwɔ polisifo baanu wɔ ne fie akyi anadwo ne awia.
He is a very efficient man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔyɛ adwuma yiye.
I just had to say it	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka ara kwa
But nothing much.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ kɛse.
However, I think it will be difficult	Nanso, misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ den
I knew it was going to be a big deal	Ná minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ ade kɛse
The same is true in the classroom.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ adesua dan mu.
That seems to be true, too.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno nso yɛ nokware.
Most will melt and soften.	Dodow no ara bɛbɔ na ayɛ mmerɛw.
You can wear new clothes.	Wubetumi ahyɛ ntade foforo.
All I wanted was to go home to my wife	Nea na mepɛ ara ne sɛ mekɔ fie akɔ me yere nkyɛn
At the same time.	Bere koro no ara mu.
And it had to be that way.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
Never use it.	Mfa nni dwuma da.
I need it, I have something important to do	Me hia no, mewɔ biribi a ɛho hia a meyɛ
That will absolutely happen.	Ɛno bɛba koraa.
But the song was flawed.	Nanso na dwom no wɔ mfomso.
But it was none of that.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɛno mu biara.
I see this happening all the time	Mihu sɛ eyi rekɔ so bere nyinaa
You’re the talk of the town, you know.	Wo ne kurow no mu asɛm, wunim.
Quickly.	Ntɛmntɛm.
And you are here.	Na wowɔ ha.
I couldn’t take it lying down anymore	Na mintumi mfa no sɛ ɛda fam bio
I think that’s an important point	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm a ɛho hia
I don't know any of the people involved in this.	Minnim nnipa a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ eyi mu no mu biara.
Never say such things to me again.	Nka nsɛm a ɛte saa nkyerɛ me bio da.
I wanted to be someone.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ obi.
I know what was going on	Minim nea na ɛrekɔ so
He’s not even your type.	Ɔnyɛ wo su mpo.
I was sure something was wrong	Ná migye di sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye
I thought hard about it.	Misusuw ho denneennen.
This was home, and he was here.	Ná eyi yɛ fie, na na ɔwɔ ha.
This took clotheslines.	Eyi gyee ntade a wɔde hyɛ ntade mu.
I couldn’t get through to him	Na mintumi mfa mu nkɔ ne nkyɛn
But that was no longer true.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ nokware bio.
I was with him in no time	Ná mewɔ ne nkyɛn wɔ bere tiaa bi mu
It is neither good nor bad.	Ɛnyɛ papa anaa bɔne biara.
I do it every morning	Meyɛ no anɔpa biara
Some power of the mind	Adwene no tumi bi
I had no idea where the picture came from	Ná minnim baabi a mfonini no fi
I thought we could help each other	Misusuwii sɛ yebetumi aboa yɛn ho
I didn’t know where it was	Ná minnim baabi a ɛwɔ
For me, too, it was amazing.	Me nso, na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I had to look into it	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu
It doesn’t matter much.	Ɛnyɛ hwee pii.
What will he do.	Dɛn na ɔbɛyɛ.
I'm leaving you this time	Mede wo kwan saa bere yi
That would have been better.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
I admire you all so much	M’ani gye mo nyinaa ho kɛse
That is very important.	Ɛno ho hia yiye.
Use a variety of materials.	Fa nneɛma ahorow di dwuma.
There was no bed.	Ná mpa biara nni hɔ.
He put his hand on his head.	Ɔde ne nsa too ne ti so.
The hearing lasted about two hours	Asɛm no dii bɛyɛ nnɔnhwerew abien
But more often than not, the human element was missing.	Nanso mpɛn pii no, na onipa ade a ɛwɔ asɛm no mu no nni hɔ.
I keep meaning to tell you	Mekɔ so kyerɛ sɛ mɛka akyerɛ wo
I wonder how we can know where we are	Misusuw sɛnea yebetumi ahu baabi a yɛwɔ ho
He wanted to be a little more.	Na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔka ho kakra.
Take their mouths again.	Fa wɔn ano bio.
I knew you couldn’t like me	Na minim sɛ worentumi mpɛ me
I understand where your head is	Mete baabi a wo ti wɔ ase
I couldn’t figure out how to do it.	Na mintumi nhu sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
I want to take care of myself	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ me ho
A few new ones were added	Wɔde foforo kakraa bi kaa ho
You are not real to them.	Wonyɛ obi ankasa mma wɔn.
But it was new things he had to work on.	Nanso na ɛyɛ nneɛma foforo a na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ho adwuma.
Not that that’s a bad thing.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ ade bɔne.
Return an error.	Fa mfomso san ba.
Another opportunity, and a big one	Hokwan foforo, ne kɛse
I wanted to be as great academically as they were	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ kɛse wɔ adesua mu te sɛ wɔn ara
There was no one else.	Ná obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
No one was there that night.	Ná obiara nni hɔ saa anadwo no.
I was the only one out there.	Ná me nkutoo na mewɔ abɔnten hɔ.
But you can see him.	Nanso wubetumi ahu no.
I want you to think about something	Mepɛ sɛ wususuw biribi ho
You can do that.	Wubetumi ayɛ saa.
He just wants you to see him.	Ɔpɛ sɛ wuhu no ara kwa.
And think about the money.	Na susuw sika no ho.
Which we can see for sure, no doubt.	Nea yebetumi ahu no yiye, akyinnye biara nni ho.
I had no intention of continuing	Ná ɛnyɛ me adwene sɛ mɛkɔ so ayɛ saa
This week in sleep.	Dapɛn yi wɔ nna mu.
It was like his son.	Ná ɛte sɛ ne ba no.
Inappropriate.	Ɛnyɛ papa.
But it’s not there at all.	Nanso ɛnyɛ hɔ koraa.
I wish mine were alive for them	Me yam a anka me de no te ase ma wɔn
That was a success.	Ɛno dii yiye.
Go and go.	Kɔ na kɔ.
It hurts to touch.	Ɛyɛ yaw sɛ wode wo nsa bɛka.
I didn’t know what had happened	Ná minnim nea asi
You and my father and this is our dress.	Wo ne me papa na eyi ne yɛn atade.
However, it is highly unlikely.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye koraa.
They give their time.	Wɔde wɔn bere ma.
I think that’s your habit	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ wo su
There are just so many days, hot days too.	Nna pii wɔ hɔ ara kwa, nna a ɛyɛ hyew nso.
If you don’t like this, you’re a terrible person.	Sɛ w’ani nnye eyi ho a, na woyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hu.
It might be something else.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ biribi foforo.
I just look at this	Mehwɛ eyi kɛkɛ
I can’t believe that boy is me	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ saa abarimaa no ne me
So if that number is true .	Enti sɛ saa dodow no ara yɛ nokware a .
I have you in my arms	Mewɔ wo wɔ me nsa so
He will give you something he knows you really want.	Ɔde biribi a onim sɛ wopɛ ampa bɛma wo.
It’s not one of us, it’s both of us.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn mu biako, ɛyɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa.
None of them noticed.	Wɔn mu biara anhu.
Your problem may affect him.	Ebia wo haw no bɛka no.
This is something else.	Eyi yɛ biribi foforo.
But I wanted to apologize	Nanso na mepɛ sɛ mepa kyɛw
This doesn’t make me happy.	Eyi mma m’ani nnye.
This was no such thing.	Ná eyi nyɛ ade a ɛte saa.
I really enjoyed the book	M’ani gyee nhoma no ho paa
I wasn't great at it	Ná menyɛ kɛse wɔ ho
I wonder how that happens	Misusuw sɛnea ɛno ba no ho
It’s good for him.	Ɛyɛ papa ma no.
I should have known otherwise	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛ ɛnyɛ saa
I don’t want to believe this	Mempɛ sɛ migye eyi di
I wanted to go with them.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne wɔn kɔ.
Believe me, it’s true.	Gye me di, ɛyɛ nokware.
Someone you need to know.	Obi a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu no.
I see the same thing with books.	Mihu ade koro no ara wɔ nhoma ahorow ho.
We were children.	Ná yɛyɛ mmofra.
I gave them all my money	Mede me sika nyinaa maa wɔn
I didn’t want to be that girl anymore	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa abeawa no bio
Right now he has no clue.	Seesei ara onni biribiara a obetumi ahu.
He worked, she worked.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma, ɔno nso yɛɛ adwuma.
Believe that you can do it.	Gye di sɛ wubetumi ayɛ.
But it’s not yours.	Nanso ɛnyɛ wo de.
Please, this time.	Mesrɛ wo, saa bere yi.
I want you to come with me	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me bɛba
Only for a short time.	Bere tiaa bi pɛ.
And that’s kind of true.	Na ɛno yɛ nokware bi.
First, my clothes.	Nea edi kan no, me ntade.
Not even about this.	Ɛnyɛ eyi ho mpo.
The addicts control everything.	Wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho ahyɛ mu no di biribiara so.
I see him as a winner.	Mihu no sɛ obi a odi nkonim.
Get involved, if you want.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu, sɛ wopɛ a.
I couldn’t survive much of this.	Na mintumi nnya nkwa wɔ eyi mu pii.
This is not the case in our work.	Eyi nte saa wɔ yɛn adwuma no mu.
I should never have liked the idea	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ m’ani gye adwene no ho da
I was part of that group	Ná meka saa kuw no ho
I am a very busy man	Meyɛ ɔbarima a onni adagyew koraa
He could let himself be.	Ná obetumi ama ne ho ayɛ saa.
Maybe he had a plan.	Ebia na ɔwɔ nhyehyɛe bi a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma.
I want us to be friends	Mepɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo
We already have an idea of ​​what we need to do.	Yɛwɔ adwene bi dedaw wɔ nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho.
I feel like it’s true.	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
Be a part of it.	Yɛ ne fã.
I just think you’ll be happy	Misusuw kɛkɛ sɛ w’ani begye
Your pictures make me feel at home again.	Wo mfonini ahorow no ma mete nka sɛ mewɔ fie bio.
I didn’t want that, but that’s the way it was.	Ná mempɛ saa, nanso saa na na ɛte.
There is always a reason.	Nea enti a ɛte saa wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
Please don’t do it again.	Mesrɛ wo, ɛnyɛ bio.
I wonder how much control he has over his powers	Misusuw sɛnea ɔwɔ ne tumi ahorow so tumi kɛse no ho
I will gladly do this for you	Mede anigye bɛyɛ eyi ama wo
Do what you’re passionate about.	Yɛ nea w’ani gye ho.
No one likes them.	Obiara ani nnye wɔn ho.
I’ll miss your kids	M’ani begye wo mma ho
They all owe him.	Wɔn nyinaa de no ka.
Not that he can do anything about the current crisis.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ obetumi ayɛ mprempren ɔhaw no ho biribi.
Out with the old and in with the new.	Wo ne dedaw no fi adi na fa foforo no kɔ mu.
Maybe that’s what’s going on here.	Ebia ɛno ne nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha.
This might just be fine.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ yiye ara kwa.
They focused on it.	Wɔde n’adwene sii so.
And yet there it is.	Na nanso ɛwɔ hɔ.
And it seemed like it was supposed to be.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
It’s the same as it is with you.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte wɔ wo ho no ara pɛ.
I just want to be there for you	Nea mepɛ ara ne sɛ mewɔ hɔ ma wo
It was not the time to work.	Ná ɛnyɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma.
You tell me what you think.	Woka nea wususuw kyerɛ me.
The books are still with me.	Nhoma ahorow no da so ara ka me ho.
I have bad hair days	Mewɔ ti nhwi nna bɔne
I can’t tell you how much that lifted us up.	Mintumi nka sɛnea ɛno maa yɛn so kɛse no nkyerɛ wo.
That’s a big deal.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse.
It wasn’t about age.	Na ɛnyɛ mfe a obi adi ho asɛm.
I have no idea what he was doing there	Minnim nea na ɔreyɛ wɔ hɔ no ho adwene biara
These claims were completely false.	Ná saa nsɛm yi yɛ atoro koraa.
I wanted them to be happy	Ná mepɛ sɛ wɔn ani gye
I did and you know what that got me to	Meyɛɛ saa na wunim nea ɛno de me kɔɔ so
I had some this morning.	Na mewɔ bi anɔpa yi.
But none of them did.	Nanso wɔn mu biara anyɛ saa.
Classes are difficult.	Adesua ahorow yɛ den.
There’s plenty, everyone.	Ɛwɔ hɔ pii, obiara.
He could easily do it.	Ná obetumi ayɛ no mmerɛw.
It was just sitting there.	Ná ɛte hɔ ara kwa.
I think you have as good a chance as anyone	Misusuw sɛ wowɔ hokwan pa te sɛ obiara
Remember what each one is and make the most of it.	Kae nea wɔn mu biara yɛ na fa di dwuma yiye.
Everything is the situation.	Biara ne tebea no.
I want to sleep a lot more	Mepɛ sɛ meda pii bio
Only you are mentioned.	Wo nkutoo na wɔka ho asɛm.
He had to do something.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
I wanted my mind to lie to me	Ná mepɛ sɛ m’adwene di atoro kyerɛ me
I need to know the truth	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nokware no
It’s still great now.	Ɛda so ara yɛ kɛse mprempren.
This indicates the robustness of a system.	Eyi kyerɛ sɛnea nhyehyɛe bi mu yɛ den.
This applies to you as well.	Eyi fa wo nso ho.
I see him almost every day.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mihu no da biara da.
As if no one really knew.	Te sɛ nea obiara nnim ankasa.
I know how much you miss him	Minim sɛnea wokae no kɛse no
Nothing like that now.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa mprempren.
I am beautiful in every way	Me ho yɛ fɛ wɔ ɔkwan biara so
I didn't know what to do with the rest	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ wɔ nea aka no ho
But he’s not.	Nanso n’ani.
I love the long sleeves	M’ani gye nsa tenten no ho
He and my father were involved for a time.	Ɔne me papa de wɔn ho hyɛɛ mu bere bi.
No faces are included.	Anim biara nka ho.
That’s his help.	Ɛno ne ne mmoa.
I had no idea he would go this far.	Ná minnim sɛ ɔbɛkɔ akyiri saa.
But there is hope here.	Nanso anidaso wɔ ha.
He gave it to you.	Ɔde maa wo.
I wanted to tell him	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no
I love working on them.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ wɔn ho adwuma.
He can be about anything.	Obetumi ayɛ biribiara ho asɛm.
This seems much closer to the truth.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi bɛn nokware no kɛse.
I never even knew you existed	Minnim mpo da sɛ wowɔ hɔ
I want to do it more than anything	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ no sen biribiara
I had to go with them	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wɔn kɔ
No other cars on the road.	Kar foforo biara nni kwan no so.
And people just deal with it.	Na nkurɔfo di ho dwuma ara kwa.
Make it a habit.	Fa yɛ wo su.
I relied heavily on it at that point	Mede me ho too so kɛse wɔ saa bere no mu
That’s really good.	Ɛno yɛ papa ankasa.
A hand touched hers	Nsa bi de ne nsa kaa ne ho
I set out to do it for him, anyway	Mede me ho too so sɛ mɛyɛ no ama no, ɔkwan biara so
You could have gotten yourself a shot.	Anka wubetumi anya wo ho tuo.
That was power.	Ná ɛno ne tumi.
Everything has gone downhill dramatically.	Biribiara akɔ fam kɛse.
I think he would like that too	Misusuw sɛ ɔno nso bɛpɛ saa
He is the only one left.	Ɔno nkutoo ne nea aka.
There was no question about that.	Na asɛm biara nni ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
You know we have.	Wunim sɛ yɛwɔ.
I made this last night	Meyɛɛ eyi anadwo a etwaam no
I know you’ve got it	Minim sɛ wode wo nsa aka
I think we’ve all had enough	Misusuw sɛ yɛn nyinaa anya nea ɛdɔɔso
I didn’t even want to.	Ná mempɛ mpo.
The police don’t believe me.	Polisifo no nnye me nni.
I didn’t always want to have to rely on someone	Ná ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na mepɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ mede me ho to obi so
My day starts as any business would.	Me da no fi ase sɛnea adwuma biara bɛyɛ no.
I have done this many times	Mayɛ eyi mpɛn pii
I understood why he had to do this	Metee nea enti a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ eyi no ase
I never really knew why	Na minnim nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa da
I never know how to say this	Minnim sɛnea mɛka eyi da
Believe you get them.	Gye di sɛ wo nsa ka wɔn.
I think there are several reasons	Misusuw sɛ nneɛma pii nti na ɛte saa
Maybe it will be in the morning.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ anɔpa.
I had another job to do	Ná mewɔ adwuma foforo a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ
They are the only ones we can give.	Wɔn nkutoo na yebetumi de ama.
Or anyone else, for that matter.	Anaasɛ obi foforo biara, ɛno nti.
I just have to go a little further	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ akyiri kakra kɛkɛ
However, it is offered at the same price.	Nanso, wɔde ma wɔ bo koro no ara mu.
He was just like me.	Ná ɔte sɛ me ara pɛ.
It’s so beautiful, so innocent.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye, ɛho nni asɛm yiye.
I wasn’t alone in this	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na na mewɔ eyi mu
A good boy.	Abarimaa pa.
Most of them are very experienced.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara ho akokwaw paa.
This is the true game	Eyi ne nokware agoru no
He was actually very nice.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye ankasa.
I don't feel bad about it	Ɛnyɛ me yaw wɔ ho
I’m interested in the story	M’ani gye asɛm no ho
You want to know everything.	Wopɛ sɛ wuhu biribiara.
I really, really like him	M’ani gye ne ho paa, paa
Nothing worked with it either, just like the other two.	Biribiara nso ne no anyɛ adwuma, te sɛ abien a aka no ara pɛ.
There is not much time left.	Bere pii nni hɔ a aka.
I am in that business with them	Me ne wɔn wɔ saa adwuma no mu
No one in power seems to care about that.	Ɛte sɛ nea obiara a ɔwɔ tumi no mfa saa asɛm no ho.
The rest found themselves in the latter.	Wɔn a aka no huu wɔn ho wɔ nea etwa to no mu.
I think that’s pretty cool	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ fɛ yiye
And if it’s fun, you’re doing it wrong.	Na sɛ ɛyɛ anigye a, na woreyɛ no bɔne.
The other half of power.	Tumi fã a aka.
Hours were also at stake.	Ná nnɔnhwerew a wɔde yɛ adwuma no nso ho asɛm wɔ ho.
I really enjoyed it	Ná m’ani gye ho ankasa
They drive too close.	Wɔka kar bɛn wɔn dodo.
There is still work to be done.	Adwuma da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
People are trying to include me.	Nkurɔfo rebɔ mmɔden sɛ wɔde me bɛka ho.
Not immediately.	Ɛnyɛ ntɛm ara.
I want to not be big	Mepɛ sɛ menyɛ kɛse
For the most part, that’s not a big problem.	Wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu no, ɛno nyɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
Except for the language.	Gye kasa no nkutoo.
I don’t know all about him	Minnim ne ho nsɛm nyinaa
I think it always will be	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa
Keep your eyes open.	Ma w’ani nna hɔ.
I can't agree with that	Mintumi ne saa asɛm no nyɛ adwene
There is no effort.	Mmɔden biara nni hɔ.
I hoped things would work out	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ nneɛma bɛkɔ yiye
I didn’t want the fun to end	Ná mempɛ sɛ anigye no bɛba awiei
Apparently it happened at least one other time.	Ɛda adi sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, esii bere foforo.
And you know more than that.	Na wunim pii sen saa.
That may not always be the case.	Ebia ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛte saa.
I want to give my opinion	Mepɛ sɛ mede m’adwene ma
That’s another story.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm foforo.
Here’s why it’s not.	Nea enti a ɛnte saa no ni.
He had no desire to do so.	Ná onni ɔpɛ a ɔde bɛyɛ saa.
It has to be one of us.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yɛn mu biako.
I never want you to have to think about it again.	Mempɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho bio da.
I know a lot of people probably disagree with me	Minim sɛ ebia nnipa pii ne me nyɛ adwene
I agree with you.	Me ne wo yɛ adwene.
What a brilliant and busy man you are.	Ɔbarima a ne ho akokwaw na onni adagyew bɛn ara na woyɛ.
You are here now, and there is plenty of time.	Wowɔ ha seesei, na bere pii wɔ hɔ.
I think it was a little weird	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ nwonwa kakra
Forget about him.	Wo werɛ mfi ne ho asɛm.
Heads down here.	Ti ahorow kɔ fam wɔ ha.
This license is continuous.	Saa tumi krataa yi kɔ so.
I see a lot of wisdom in it	Mihu nyansa pii wɔ mu
I didn’t seem to care	Ɛte sɛ nea na ɛnyɛ me asɛm
Many of the animals believed him.	Mmoa no mu pii gyee no dii.
I get to know everyone and how they do things.	Mihu obiara ne sɛnea wɔyɛ nneɛma.
I can’t say that about many people	Mintumi nka saa mfa nnipa pii ho
They were terrible.	Ná wɔyɛ hu.
And neither do your friends.	Na wo nnamfo nso nyɛ saa.
There will be time for such a story.	Bere bɛba ama asɛm a ɛte saa.
I still don’t believe it	Meda so ara nnye nni
I’m glad it all went well	M’ani agye sɛ ne nyinaa kɔɔ yiye
I see things that are not real	Mihu nneɛma a ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa
That was dangerous, absolutely terrifying.	Ná ɛno yɛ asiane, na ɛyɛ hu koraa.
I can’t get enough of it	Mintumi nnya bi pii
However, I have an idea	Nanso, mewɔ ho adwene bi
I had to be careful	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye
I don't really know anything about this.	Minnim eyi ho hwee ankasa.
A really nice guy.	Ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ ankasa.
I never wish you anything but the best	Mempɛ biribiara mma wo da gye nea eye sen biara
But add this to it.	Nanso fa eyi ka ho.
There were many of them.	Ná wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
He could have said that.	Anka obetumi aka saa.
I don't think you should use it.	Misusuw sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wode di dwuma.
I can't do anything about that	Mintumi nyɛ saa asɛm no ho hwee
And treat him like a snake.	Na yɛ no sɛ ɔwɔ.
Normally, I never did	Mpɛn pii no, na menyɛ saa da
This year, they.	Afe yi, wɔn.
I use it all the time	Mede di dwuma bere nyinaa
Start again, somewhere else.	Fi ase bio, wɔ baabi foforo.
Someone out there has to take a risk.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi a ɔwɔ abɔnten hɔ de ne ho to asiane mu.
I couldn’t find his label	Na mintumi nhu ne din a wɔde ahyɛ mu no
He had never been so strong.	Ná ɔnyɛ den saa da.
Their business fell apart.	Wɔn adwuma no hwee ase.
I could have ended it there	Anka metumi de aba awiei wɔ hɔ
I think you have a point there	Misusuw sɛ wowɔ asɛm bi wɔ hɔ
They risked everything to save me.	Wɔde biribiara too asiane mu gyee me nkwa.
I have some of it.	Mewɔ bi.
This way you can e.g.	Saa kwan yi so no wubetumi s.e.
I don’t even have to think about it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ misusuw ho mpo.
Tell me how you can do it.	Ka sɛnea wubetumi ayɛ no kyerɛ me.
But back from that really fun!.	Nanso akyi fi saa anigye ankasa!.
If not, move on.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, kɔ so.
I want him to obey.	Mepɛ sɛ odi so.
I didn’t like this	Ná m’ani nnye eyi ho
We have to do it differently.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ no ɔkwan foforo so.
Pretend the car accident never happened.	Yɛ wo ho sɛ kar akwanhyia no amma da.
A strange thought touched him	Adwene bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa kaa ne ho
We were on the street at the time.	Saa bere no na yɛwɔ abɔnten so.
I say it in a positive way	Meka no wɔ ɔkwan pa so
And the car itself.	Na kar no ankasa nso.
It was not a happy time.	Ná ɛnyɛ anigye bere.
It’s not our doing.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn yɛ.
I guess it wasn’t important anyway	Misusuw sɛ na ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia ɔkwan biara so
I wanted to put him in my bed, though	Nanso, na mepɛ sɛ mede no to me mpa so
This just doesn’t work.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma kɛkɛ.
I have to go there and talk to them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ ne wɔn kasa.
However, there are a few details.	Nanso, nsɛm kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I loved that in a man	M’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho wɔ ɔbarima bi mu
I was painting all night.	Ná mereyɛ mfonini anadwo mũ no nyinaa.
I'm still a little surprised, though	Nanso, meda so ara yɛ me nwonwa kakra
At the time, no one thought anything of it.	Saa bere no na obiara nsusuw ho hwee.
I was supposed to see him again this weekend	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no bio dapɛn awiei yi
I still live at home with my mother	Meda so ara ne me maame te fie
I taste myself on him	Meka me ho hwɛ wɔ ne so
I can give them that perspective.	Metumi ama wɔn saa adwene no.
He just wants to win, and he wants to play.	Nea ɔpɛ ara ne sɛ odi nkonim, na ɔpɛ sɛ odi agoru.
He touched his eyes.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa n’ani.
I’m glad it was a mistake.	M’ani agye sɛ na ɛyɛ mfomso.
He wanted to do a job.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma bi.
I love the pictures	M’ani gye mfonini ahorow no ho
I could barely see him	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nhu no
Let your child be a child.	Ma wo ba nyɛ abofra.
Did they tell me.	So wɔka kyerɛɛ me.
I think you have been used	Misusuw sɛ wɔde wo adi dwuma
And after their children.	Na wɔn mma akyi.
He shouldn’t have said that.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔka saa.
I need to know his name	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu ne din
The information below is not exhaustive.	Nsɛm a ɛwɔ ase ha no nyɛ nea edi mũ.
I want us to be a team	Mepɛ sɛ yɛyɛ kuw
I have to hand it over completely.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede hyɛ no nsa koraa.
We can’t have that, and you know that.	Yɛrentumi nnya saa, na wunim saa.
You did know it.	Ná wunim ampa.
I'm sure everyone does.	Migye di sɛ obiara yɛ saa.
I couldn’t even get that right	Na mintumi nnya saa asɛm no yiye mpo
I look over the edge	Mehwɛ ano no so
The girl certainly knew what she wanted.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na abeawa no nim nea ɔpɛ.
I felt right at home with them	Metee nka sɛ me ne wɔn wɔ hɔ wɔ fie
It’s hard to.	Ɛyɛ den.
I want tomorrow gone	Mepɛ sɛ ɔkyena kɔ
You want, you want, you want!.	Wopɛ, wopɛ, wopɛ!.
He should not even associate with people.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔne nkurɔfo mpo bɔ.
It’s actually pretty amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye ankasa.
I know how amazing his was	Minim sɛnea na ne de no yɛ nwonwa
I did what he wanted, when he wanted	Meyɛɛ nea ɔpɛ, bere a ɔpɛ
He also kicked his legs.	Ná ɔbɔ ne nan nso.
This is a one time thing.	Eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ bere biako pɛ.
But that is hardly new.	Nanso ɛkame ayɛ sɛ saa asɛm no nyɛ ade foforo.
I need to think this thing through	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw saa ade yi ho yiye
But none of that is true.	Nanso saa nneɛma no mu biara nyɛ nokware.
It’s as simple as that.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ ɛno ara.
I didn’t know how to say it	Ná minnim sɛnea mɛka
He seemed happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye.
I bring some things	Mede nneɛma bi ba
A few years ago, everything was fine	Mfe kakraa bi a atwam ni no, na biribiara yɛ fɛ
I was doing the same thing	Ná me nso mereyɛ saa ara
He glanced out the back window.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ akyi mfɛnsere no mu.
This happens to many people.	Eyi to nnipa pii.
I think he was surprised	Misusuw sɛ ne ho dwiriw no
It’s a nice day.	Ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye.
This is time consuming and not fun.	Eyi gye bere na ɛnyɛ anigye.
I'm not really surprised	Ɛnyɛ me nwonwa ankasa
I think it was a long time ago	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ bere tenten a atwam ni
He didn't even know there was one.	Ná onnim mpo sɛ biako wɔ hɔ.
And that’s what the song is about.	Na ɛno ne nea dwom no fa ho.
You can see this in the first two pictures below.	Wubetumi ahu eyi wɔ mfonini abien a edi kan a ɛwɔ ase ha no mu.
This was a critical moment.	Ná eyi yɛ bere a ɛho hia kɛse.
Now we are in a good time.	Seesei yɛwɔ bere pa mu.
Or so it used to be.	Anaasɛ saa na na ɛte kan no.
I have a negative view of things	Mewɔ nneɛma ho adwene bɔne
It shouldn’t be that way.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I didn’t even know where he lived	Ná minnim baabi a ɔte mpo
I always admired him and wanted to get to know him better	Ná m’ani gye ne ho bere nyinaa na na mepɛ sɛ mihu no yiye
He shrugged, and gave her the word.	Ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ ne ho, na ɔde asɛm no maa no.
I can't let you inside.	Mintumi mma wo nkɔ mu.
I just use that.	Mede ɛno ara na edi dwuma.
He wasn't too keen on that.	Ná n’ani nnye saa ade no ho kɛse.
I will give that to him.	Mede saa bɛma no.
It was never about the money.	Na ɛnyɛ sika no ho asɛm da.
I wish this was our home, but it isn’t	Me yam a anka eyi yɛ yɛn fie, nanso ɛnte saa
I can’t go to him	Mintumi nkɔ ne nkyɛn
I had this issue when I was there	Na mewɔ saa asɛm yi bere a na mewɔ hɔ no
I thought things were going well and you seemed happy	Misusuwii sɛ nneɛma rekɔ yiye na na ɛte sɛ nea w’ani agye
This was not ideal.	Ná eyi nyɛ nea eye sen biara.
After a while, the bus left	Bere tiaa bi akyi, na bɔs no tu fii hɔ
She was so charming	Ná ɔyɛ saa a ne ho yɛ fɛ saa
I think there are two things	Misusuw sɛ nneɛma abien bi wɔ hɔ
City just two more days away	Kurow a aka nna abien pɛ bio
There was none of that.	Ná ɛno mu biara nni hɔ.
I can get you another one	Metumi anya foforo ama wo
I had my reasons for not wanting to get involved	Ná mewɔ nneɛma bi a enti mempɛ sɛ mede me ho hyɛ mu
When he gets stronger, he can be a force.	Sɛ ne ho yɛ den kɛse a, obetumi ayɛ tumi.
That’s not what the concept is all about.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea adwene no kyerɛ.
I had done that very well for some time.	Ná mayɛ saa yiye paa bere bi.
So was everyone else.	Saa ara na na obiara nso te.
He had no idea how long he would be working.	Ná onni bere tenten a ɔde bɛyɛ adwuma no ho adwene biara.
He looked at her and returned to the road.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no ​​na ɔde n’ani san baa kwan no so.
I caught a glimpse of him at the door	Mihuu no kakra wɔ ɔpon no ano
In either case, the police will take their time to get here.	Wɔ tebea abien no nyinaa mu no, polisifo begye wɔn bere akɔ ha.
A dog got mine.	Ɔkraman bi nyaa me de no.
What a painful experience.	Ɛyɛ yaw bɛn ara ni.
I know where to look	Minim baabi a ɛsɛ sɛ mihu
She had difficulty concentrating.	Ná ɛyɛ den ma no sɛ ɔde n’adwene besi biribi so.
There are many things.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ.
I think tomorrow will be a good day	Misusuw sɛ ɔkyena bɛyɛ da pa
It’s absolutely amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
I think he might make it this time	Misusuw sɛ ebia obetumi ayɛ saa bere yi
It might be a good thing.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ ade pa.
What he wants.	Nea ɔpɛ.
However, there was nothing anyone could do at the time.	Nanso, na biribiara nni hɔ a obiara betumi ayɛ saa bere no.
But this is only one element of his plan.	Nanso eyi yɛ ne nhyehyɛe no mu nneɛma biako pɛ.
That would have been too easy.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
I was actually doing quite well	Ná mereyɛ yiye koraa ankasa
We can do it.	Yebetumi ayɛ.
I thought it was best, anyway	Misusuwii sɛ eye sen biara, sɛnea ɛte biara
I thought what horrible legs he had	Misusuwii sɛ nan a ɛyɛ hu bɛn na ɔwɔ
His truth, his truth and the real truth is there.	Ne nokware, ne nokware ne nokware ankasa no wɔ hɔ.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Ebia kakra, ebia pii.
I can’t think of any other way	Mintumi nsusuw ɔkwan foforo biara ho
Out here, now and then, a strange thing can happen.	Ha akyi, mprempren ne mprempren, ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa betumi asi.
He has them.	Ɔwɔ wɔn.
I have no real problem with this.	Minni ɔhaw ankasa biara wɔ eyi ho.
Prison uniforms are prison uniforms.	Afiase ntade yɛ afiase ntade.
I couldn’t believe what was happening	Ná mintumi nnye nea ɛrekɔ so no nni
I felt it too.	Me nso metee nka.
Everyone has a story.	Obiara wɔ asɛm bi.
But you know, it’s their thing.	Nanso wunim, ɛyɛ wɔn ade.
However, the situation is more complicated.	Nanso, tebea no mu yɛ den sen saa.
Nothing really could.	Biribiara antumi ankasa.
Everything is great.	Biribiara yɛ kɛse.
This is a huge risk.	Eyi yɛ asiane kɛse.
The end of the lesson.	Adesua no awiei.
I can't add classes either	Mintumi mfa adesua ahorow nka ho nso
It’s just a simple thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ara kwa.
I loved every moment we did it	Ná m’ani gye bere biara a yɛbɛyɛ no ho
Many people didn’t know that.	Ná nnipa pii nnim saa.
I love his way.	M’ani gye ne kwan ho.
In the short term, at least.	Wɔ bere tiaa mu no, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
I don't have it.	Minni nna.
On his head.	Wɔ ne ti so.
I have no problem with that	Minni ɔhaw biara wɔ saa asɛm no ho
I told you to go downstairs	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ kɔ ase hɔ
I have nothing to offer them	Minni biribiara a mede bɛma wɔn
I wonder what he will do about it	Misusuw nea ɔbɛyɛ wɔ ho
I also had some back problems	Ná mewɔ akyi haw bi nso
That’s what you do too.	Ɛno ne nea wo nso woyɛ.
I hoped he would	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa
That is very exciting.	Ɛno yɛ anigye yiye.
I hope you are doing well	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ woreyɛ yiye
Everything here is true, but only part of the truth.	Biribiara a ɛwɔ ha no yɛ nokware, nanso nokware no fã bi pɛ.
I couldn’t control them	Ná mintumi nni wɔn so
He knew this would happen.	Ná onim sɛ eyi bɛba.
I want him to say more.	Mepɛ sɛ ɔka pii.
It’s still a beautiful car.	Ɛda so ara yɛ kar a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I think we can get them all here	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi ama wɔn nyinaa aba ha
That’s bad enough.	Ɛno yɛ bɔne sɛnea ɛsɛ.
And that’s what ultimately matters.	Na ɛno ne nea awiei koraa no ɛho hia.
Time had gone too fast.	Ná bere akɔ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
There was something odd about it.	Ná biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ho.
I wish he would go	Me yam a anka ɔbɛkɔ
I had no idea what was going on	Ná minni nea ɛrekɔ so no ho adwene biara
And you know what that means.	Na wunim nea ɛno kyerɛ.
They are very inexpensive.	Wɔn bo nyɛ den koraa.
So many times.	Enti mpɛn pii.
I'm still overwhelmed	Meda so ara ahyɛ me so
The kids hit hard, he wasn’t.	Mmofra no bɔɔ denneennen, na ɔnyɛ saa.
I certainly hoped he would	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa
Put your trust in me.	Fa wo ho to me so.
Very important, at that	Nea ɛho hia yiye, wɔ saa bere no mu
You probably know that too.	Ebia wunim saa nso.
The power of the mind over things.	Tumi a adwene wɔ wɔ nneɛma so.
How wonderful it is.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I wonder if he likes me	Misusuw sɛ ebia n’ani gye me ho anaa
But he wants to do that.	Nanso ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I'm really, very sorry	Mepa wo kyɛw ampa, kɛse
Sure, you can transfer the story and characters quite well.	Ampa, wubetumi de asɛm no ne nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no akɔ baabi foforo yiye koraa.
There are a number of reasons for this.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
I added another dog.	Mede ɔkraman foforo kaa ho.
I loved everything	Ná m’ani gye biribiara ho
There is nothing in it for them.	Biribiara nni mu mma wɔn.
I wish he was here to save me	Me yam a anka ɔwɔ ha agye me nkwa
I told him, but he didn’t care	Meka kyerɛɛ no, nanso ɛnyɛ no asɛm
I was the culprit	Ná me na meyɛ bɔne no
It’s not a fancy car.	Ɛnyɛ kar a ɛyɛ fɛ.
But this is not a book.	Nanso eyi nyɛ nhoma.
At least not one that everyone can relate to.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ biako a obiara betumi aka ho asɛm.
They don’t like that.	Wɔn ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
A lot to remember.	Pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wokae.
This was not the case	Ná eyi nyɛ saa
That face was very familiar.	Ná saa anim no nim yiye.
I think he probably knew	Misusuw sɛ ebia na onim
I think it will be even better.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ papa mpo.
He will help us.	Ɔbɛboa yɛn.
He did so when he was a child.	Ɔyɛɛ saa bere a na ɔyɛ abofra no.
But there were no accidents.	Nanso akwanhyia biara amma.
The room was a room and not a lock.	Ná dan no yɛ dan na ɛnyɛ ɔpon a wɔde hyɛ mu.
I know we can make it work.	Minim sɛ yebetumi ama ayɛ adwuma.
I shrugged off the idea	Mede me nsa too fam wɔ adwene no ho
Unpack your stuff.	Yi wo nneɛma no mu.
I hope that will be to your liking	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ nea w’ani gye ho
I just couldn’t understand it.	Na mintumi nte ase kɛkɛ.
I know you are new to this.	Minim sɛ woyɛ foforo wɔ eyi mu.
I am always busy, and not too busy.	Meyɛ obi a onni adagyew bere nyinaa, na minni adagyew dodo.
I could hardly believe my eyes	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nnye m’ani nni
I could even travel with you.	Ná metumi ne wo atu kwan mpo.
I also had a job to do	Ná mewɔ adwuma bi nso a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ
I could have done it, you know	Anka metumi ayɛ, wunim
The idea was certainly not new.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na adwene no nyɛ ade foforo.
It was just too wonderful.	Na ɛyɛ nwonwa dodo ara kwa.
There is no end date.	Da a wɔde bɛba awiei biara nni hɔ.
This was obviously not going the way he thought it would.	Ɛda adi sɛ na eyi nkɔ sɛnea na osusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ no.
I will do this again	Mɛyɛ eyi bio
Occupational hazard for him.	Adwuma mu asiane ma no.
I just couldn’t do that and like myself	Na mintumi nyɛ saa kɛkɛ na mepɛ me ho
You have to be strong.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ den.
I want to say thank you	Mepɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo sɛ meda wo ase
I could have gone to him	Anka metumi akɔ ne nkyɛn
I’ll love any face	M’ani begye anim biara ho
But this is not the whole story.	Nanso ɛnyɛ eyi ne asɛm no nyinaa.
I have a great chance to play.	Mewɔ hokwan kɛse a mede bɛbɔ agoru.
It’s a really great movie.	Ɛyɛ sini kɛse ankasa.
People responded really well	Nkurɔfo yɛɛ ho biribi yiye ankasa
The man was incredibly in control.	Ná ɔbarima no di so wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
I know some things you need to know	Minim nneɛma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu
I want to know who.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu hena.
It’s a spectacular one.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Many of my friends and I were able to take any trouble	Me ne me nnamfo pii tumi faa ɔhaw biara
I get to know people better.	Mihu nkurɔfo yiye.
I told him that was a good idea	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛno yɛ adwene pa
Do you know what.	So wunim nea.
They post a full picture of what happened.	Wɔde nea esii no ho mfonini a edi mũ to hɔ.
I know how hard things are for you	Minim sɛnea nneɛma yɛ den ma wo
Children do love animals.	Mmofra ani gye mmoa ho ampa.
The entire length is.	Ne tenten nyinaa yɛ.
Don’t do that.	Mma wonyɛ saa.
It wasn’t really a game at the time.	Na ɛnyɛ agoru ankasa saa bere no.
I have to be vigilant and yet	Ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani da hɔ na nanso
I nodded at the book	Mede me ti too fam kyerɛɛ nhoma no
I look at what’s inside	Mehwɛ nea ɛwɔ mu
I didn’t want this	Na mempɛ eyi
I made it to be beautiful and exciting	Meyɛɛ no ​​sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ anigye
But about this more now.	Nanso eyi ho mprempren kɛse.
One thing follows from the next.	Ade biako di akyi fi nea edi hɔ no mu.
There was no excitement.	Ná anigye biara nni hɔ.
I could be a little stronger	Ná metumi ayɛ den kakra
My mother is not the mother in the story.	Me maame nyɛ maame a ɔwɔ asɛm no mu.
You need a song like that	Wo hia dwom a ɛte saa
I just want to do things that I really enjoy.	Nea mepɛ ara ne sɛ meyɛ nneɛma a m’ani gye ho ankasa.
I don't feel bad about it.	Ɛnyɛ me yaw wɔ ho.
We weren’t all like each other.	Ná yɛn nyinaa nyɛ sɛ yɛn ho.
Everything and everyone is in it, except me.	Biribiara ne obiara wɔ mu, gye me nkutoo.
I know this is true	Minim sɛ eyi yɛ nokware
I just didn’t care about anything anymore	Na biribiara mfa me ho bio kɛkɛ
And at the time it was really weird.	Na saa bere no ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
It certainly wasn’t for me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛnyɛ me de.
The money was crucial	Ná sika no ho hia kɛse
I still believe there is an opportunity.	Meda so ara gye di sɛ hokwan bi wɔ hɔ.
But it didn’t matter anyway.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ hwee ɔkwan biara so.
You are one of us.	Woyɛ yɛn mu biako.
You are a person, not a thing.	Woyɛ onipa, ɛnyɛ ade.
It was not to be touched.	Ná ɛnyɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa bɛka ho.
A really great idea.	Adwene kɛse ankasa.
This season may add information.	Ebia saa bere yi de nsɛm bɛka ho.
The system no longer works	Nhyehyɛe no ntumi nyɛ adwuma bio
He told me he didn’t know.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ onnim.
Their time had come.	Ná wɔn bere no adu.
I tell them what is going on	Meka nea ɛrekɔ so no kyerɛ wɔn
It’s not as hard to do as you think.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ sɛnea wususuw no.
I checked it every day	Ná mehwɛ mu da biara da
I really couldn’t see it	Ankasa na mintumi nhu
They will do the same.	Saa ara na wɔn nso bɛyɛ.
The team was constantly working on it.	Ná kuw no reyɛ ho adwuma bere nyinaa.
I have to keep telling myself that they are human	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so ka kyerɛ me ho sɛ wɔyɛ nnipa
He was a good old dog.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔkraman dedaw pa.
This is not what you want from the first moment.	Eyi nyɛ nea wopɛ fi bere a edi kan no.
We’re excited too.	Yɛn nso yɛn ani agye.
He is the only one who does.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔyɛ saa.
His mistakes were serious.	Ná ne mfomso ahorow no yɛ kɛse.
I can’t do it alone	Me nkutoo ntumi nyɛ
We can debate why, but it does.	Yebetumi agye nea enti a ɛte saa no ho akyinnye, nanso ɛyɛ saa.
Or maybe that was the plan all along.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no bere nyinaa.
But that was a mistake.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ mfomso.
He definitely wanted it to be him more than anything.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔpɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno sen biribiara.
I didn’t want to do anything with it	Ná mempɛ sɛ mede biribi yɛ
He had to be someone else.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ obi foforo.
I might still be there	Ebia na meda so ara wɔ hɔ
Every time.	Bere biara.
I was kind of a party girl for a while	Ná meyɛ apontow ase abeawa bi bere tiaa bi
This in itself was not a problem.	Ná eyi ankasa nyɛ ɔhaw.
I did something for you	Meyɛɛ biribi maa wo
This is an old story.	Eyi yɛ asɛm dedaw.
It was the morning.	Ná ɛyɛ anɔpa.
I was too weak to go to work	Ná meyɛ mmerɛw dodo sɛ mɛkɔ adwuma
I didn’t know how things would turn out	Ná minnim sɛnea nneɛma bɛkɔ so
I know something is going on	Minim sɛ biribi rekɔ so
It has a car system in it.	Ɛwɔ kar nhyehyɛe bi wɔ mu.
He is unpopular.	Ɔyɛ obi a nkurɔfo ani nnye ne ho.
It’s a lot of fun.	Ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
But look at everyone.	Nanso hwɛ obiara.
I wanted to know about it	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu ho asɛm
That is nothing new.	Ɛno nyɛ ade foforo.
I will be very bad tomorrow	Mɛyɛ bɔne kɛse ɔkyena
I have a passion for all animals.	Mewɔ mmoa nyinaa ho anigye.
This is a wonderful idea.	Eyi yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It was just what he needed to hear.	Ná ɛyɛ nea na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte ara kwa.
I know about these things	Minim saa nneɛma yi ho asɛm
I’m in charge of it.	Me na mehwɛ so.
However, even this is not necessarily the case.	Nanso, eyi mpo nyɛ nea ɛte saa ankasa.
And again in the.	Na bio nso wɔ.
Thank you for your help	Meda mo ase wɔ mo mmoa no ho
Many people saw me	Nnipa pii huu me
It’s in my mind, and so it is in yours.	Ɛwɔ m’adwene mu, na saa ara na ɛwɔ wo de mu.
Or anyone for that matter.	Anaasɛ obiara ma saa asɛm no.
Trouble, as you can probably tell.	Ɔhaw, sɛnea ebia wubetumi ahu no.
It seems that.	Ɛte sɛ nea.
You can easily make this at home.	Wubetumi ayɛ eyi a ɛnyɛ den wɔ fie.
I'm happy with what I have.	M'ani gye nea mewɔ no ho.
I love everything there is	M’ani gye biribiara a ɛwɔ hɔ ho
These days there is help for that too.	Nna yi mmoa wɔ hɔ ma ɛno nso.
The test is about to begin.	Sɔhwɛ no reyɛ afi ase.
But that is not the point.	Nanso ɛnyɛ asɛm no ne no.
I can’t tell you much right now	Mintumi nka pii nkyerɛ wo mprempren
I didn’t care and neither did he	Ná ɛnyɛ me asɛm na ɔno nso mfa ho
And there’s a lot more going on.	Na pii nso rekɔ so.
It’s been a long time.	Ɛyɛ bere tenten ni.
I do the same things every day	Meyɛ nneɛma koro no ara da biara da
Sure, we may be interested in the person.	Ampa, ebia yɛn ani begye onipa no ho.
But, keep going.	Nanso, kɔ so.
He really had to deal with it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ odi ho dwuma ankasa.
I just want that one	Mepɛ saa biako no ara kwa
I heard them all.	Metee wɔn nyinaa.
I could barely sleep	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nna
This day his hands were full.	Ɛda yi na ne nsa ayɛ ma.
I know you all, you all know me	Minim mo nyinaa, mo nyinaa nim me
This can be a sin.	Eyi betumi ayɛ bɔne.
But things are getting more dangerous on the outside.	Nanso nneɛma reyɛ hu kɛse wɔ abɔnten.
Hit the ground.	Bɔ fam.
Let someone else handle it.	Ma obi foforo nni ho dwuma.
I had a lot of plans.	Ná mewɔ nhyehyɛe pii.
One more thing.	Ade biako bio.
I can’t believe this is my home	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ eyi ne me fie
I think that would be the best thing for everyone	Misusuw sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ ade a eye sen biara ama obiara
I really wanted to like this book.	Ná mepɛ sɛ m’ani gye nhoma yi ho ankasa.
That sounded pretty good.	Ɛno yɛɛ te sɛ nea eye paa.
' '.	' '.
Go back to him.	San kɔ ne nkyɛn.
I heard my father call my name	Metee sɛ me papa rebɔ me din
Try to do that sometime.	Bɔ mmɔden sɛ wobɛyɛ saa bere bi.
Most people just love it.	Nnipa dodow no ara ani gye ho ara kwa.
People started getting fancy clothes.	Nkurɔfo fii ase nyaa ntade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
And just about everything.	Na biribiara kɛkɛ.
I have no intention of even saying it	Minni adwene biara sɛ mɛka no mpo
If something happens to her, I have to apologize.	Sɛ biribi to no a, ɛsɛ sɛ mepa wo kyɛw.
I’m so happy to be here today.	M’ani agye paa sɛ mewɔ ha nnɛ.
I have a job for you	Mewɔ adwuma bi ma wo
I don’t know his real name.	Minnim ne din ankasa.
Except he isn’t.	Gye sɛ ɔnyɛ ɔno.
Maybe so, but rabbit is my last name.	Ebia ɛte saa, nanso kraman ne me din a etwa to.
A man comes out.	Ɔbarima bi fi adi.
A really simple thing	Ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa
It was easy to go on an evening	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛ mɛkɔ anwummere bi
That was very difficult.	Ná ɛno yɛ den yiye.
But there was more, more.	Nanso na pii wɔ hɔ, pii.
I knew you would	Ná minim sɛ wobɛyɛ saa
He is usually the first to notice it.	Mpɛn pii no, ɔno na odi kan hu sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
There was no mistake then.	Ná mfomso biara nni hɔ saa bere no.
I’m really excited to go now.	M’ani gye ho ankasa sɛ mɛkɔ mprempren.
I gave him the dress	Mede atade no maa no
I really wanted this man	Ná mepɛ ɔbarima yi ankasa
This time, it was better.	Saa bere yi de, na eye sen saa.
Thank you for what you have done	Meda wo ase wɔ nea woayɛ no ho
I thought it should be interesting	Misusuwii sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ anigye
And he did, it seems.	Na ɔno na ɔyɛɛ saa, ɛte sɛ nea.
He says he will.	Ɔka sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I could go on for hours.	Ná metumi akɔ so nnɔnhwerew pii.
I knew you didn’t want that either	Ná minim sɛ wo nso wompɛ saa
And so does everyone else.	Na saa ara na obiara nso yɛ.
I saw him from my window.	Mihuu no fii me mfɛnsere mu.
I know something we can do	Minim biribi a yebetumi ayɛ
The truth was nothing but the truth.	Nokware no, na biribiara nni hɔ gye nokware no.
I didn’t know what to do	Ná minnim nea menyɛ
That’s what happened here.	Ɛno ne nea esii wɔ ha.
I didn’t do that	Ɛnyɛ me na meyɛɛ saa
I didn’t know what to do with it.	Ná minnim nea mede bɛyɛ.
Attend meetings.	Kɔ nhyiam ahorow ase.
I better surrender	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ mede me ho bɛma
The letter hit home.	Krataa no bɔɔ fie.
Another day is very hot.	Da bio yɛ hyew yiye.
It was all just there, a complete thing.	Na ne nyinaa wɔ hɔ ara kwa, ade a edi mũ.
It should be enough	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛdɔɔso
That was absolutely their job.	Ná ɛno ne wɔn adwuma koraa.
I think he’s happy.	Misusuw sɛ n’ani agye.
That’s a little strange to me.	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa kakra ma me.
I had so much fun doing it.	M’ani gyee ho kɛse sɛ mereyɛ no.
How it would have been.	Sɛnea anka ɛbɛyɛ.
At work, do what you love.	Wɔ adwuma mu no, yɛ nea w’ani gye ho.
That tells you something.	Ɛno kyerɛ wo biribi.
Fill me in on some background.	Hyɛ me ma wɔ akyi bi ho.
I still didn’t even have a car.	Ná meda so ara nni kar mpo.
I thought about this for a while	Misusuw eyi ho kakra
That way you can update the settings.	Saa kwan no so no wubetumi ayɛ nhyehyɛe no foforo.
Just like his father.	Te sɛ ne papa ara pɛ.
I didn’t want to miss a single one	Ná mempɛ sɛ m’ani begye biako mpo ho
It was very cold.	Ná awɔw wom kɛse.
This is a fascinating one.	Eyi yɛ anigye.
Maybe he can help us.	Ebia obetumi aboa yɛn.
It has to be good for something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ papa ma biribi.
I have my car here	Mewɔ me kar wɔ ha
I am concerned about our people	Yɛn nkurɔfo ho asɛm haw me
He isn’t there either.	Ɔno nso nni hɔ.
That is our plan.	Ɛno ne yɛn nhyehyɛe.
Neither is true.	Biako mu biara nyɛ nokware.
And he had planned to tell her that week.	Na na wayɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ ɔbɛka akyerɛ no saa dapɛn no.
I have almost done that	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mayɛ saa
He knows it’s a lie.	Onim sɛ ɛyɛ atoro.
On second thought, it probably is.	Sɛ wususuw ho bio a, ebia ɛte saa.
He has a passion for the game.	Ɔwɔ anigye kɛse wɔ agoru no ho.
He would tell you what he thought.	Ná ɔbɛka nea osusuw ho akyerɛ wo.
Just you, and one other person if you want.	Wo nkutoo, ne onipa foforo biako sɛ wopɛ a.
I have a lot of things over my head right now.	Mewɔ nneɛma pii wɔ me ti so mprempren.
I knew there was something odd about you two.	Ná minim sɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ mo baanu no ho.
His first priority is the children.	Nea edi kan a ɔde di kan ne mmofra no.
I should have told you about them	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka wɔn ho asɛm kyerɛ wo
And it was a beautiful thing.	Na ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I have done that before	Me nso mayɛ saa pɛn
My mother had told the story many, many times.	Ná me maame aka asɛm no mpɛn pii, mpɛn pii.
I couldn’t have an accident	Na mintumi nnya akwanhyia
Keep your windows down.	Ma wo mfɛnsere nkɔ fam.
And he has plans for you.	Na ɔno nso wɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow ma wo.
This was a dangerous job	Ná eyi yɛ adwuma a asiane wom
They all knew him.	Ná wɔn nyinaa nim no.
You have to work for him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma ma no.
Maybe even both.	Ebia abien no nyinaa mpo.
Now it seems to be here.	Seesei ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ ha.
One of them had something to say.	Na wɔn mu biako wɔ asɛm bi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka.
It’s very interesting.	Ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
I shouldn’t be doing that.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
He wants everyone to know that you can do this.	Ɔpɛ sɛ obiara hu sɛ wubetumi ayɛ eyi.
I think that’s true	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware
Last year is over.	Afe a etwaam no aba awiei.
A terrible news comes to him.	Asɛm bi a ɛyɛ hu ba ne so.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Biribiara nni eyi ho ɔhaw.
It was absolutely fascinating.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye koraa.
You know their names.	Wunim wɔn din.
There is no music behind it.	Nnwom biara nni akyi.
None of them were.	Ná wɔn mu biara nyɛ saa.
No doubt he felt better.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ne ho tɔɔ no.
It’s not pretty down here.	Ɛnyɛ fɛ wɔ ha ase.
However, that is surprising.	Nanso, ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
I had done this before.	Ná mayɛ eyi pɛn.
Maybe my time has already expired	Ebia na me bere atwam dedaw
I should have gone there.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ.
A mistake is a mistake.	Mfomso yɛ mfomso.
Which should be easier than it is.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw sen sɛnea ɛte no.
I did a few musicals in school	Meyɛɛ nnwom kakraa bi wɔ sukuu mu
He wanted to be alone.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno nkutoo tra hɔ.
It’s not easy at work.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw wɔ adwumam.
I had the same problems as everyone else	Ná ɔhaw ahorow a obiara wɔ no ara na na mewɔ
As were most of us, apparently.	Sɛnea na yɛn mu dodow no ara te no, ɛda adi sɛ.
But it is what it is	Nanso ɛyɛ nea ɛte
And maybe he did.	Na ebia na ɔyɛ saa.
And if you’re weird, you’re just weird.	Na sɛ woyɛ nwonwa a, na woyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
I really felt like I didn’t have myself	Metee nka ankasa sɛ minni me ho
It’s a lot of fun.	Ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
I know what you told him	Minim nea woka kyerɛɛ no
And there are other things we can do.	Na nneɛma foforo nso wɔ hɔ a yebetumi ayɛ.
I couldn’t figure out why.	Na mintumi nhu nea enti a ɛte saa.
I did it to please you	Meyɛɛ saa sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a w’ani begye me ho
I can’t control any of that	Mintumi nni saa nneɛma no mu biara so
A picture is a representation of something	Mfonini yɛ biribi ho mfonini
And even now.	Na mprempren mpo.
This was also a lie	Ná eyi nso yɛ atoro
Talk about anything else.	Ka biribi foforo biara ho asɛm.
He was good, but you were good.	Ná ɔyɛ papa, nanso na woyɛ papa.
But he wasn’t interested.	Nanso na n’ani nnye ho.
I really liked them.	M’ani gyee wɔn ho paa.
This ends badly.	Eyi ba awiei bɔne.
I realize that doesn’t exist.	Mihu sɛ ɛno nni hɔ.
I am good at it.	Me ho akokwaw wɔ mu.
Or tell me what works.	Anaasɛ ka nea ɛyɛ adwuma kyerɛ me.
The ability to .	Tumi a ɛwɔ hɔ sɛ .
The ability to work in a team is a must.	Tumi a obi betumi ayɛ adwuma wɔ kuw mu no yɛ ade a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I could stare at this picture for hours	Ná metumi ahwɛ mfonini yi nnɔnhwerew pii
I always knew about it	Bere nyinaa na minim ho asɛm
I don’t know if he feels the same way	Minnim sɛ ebia ɔte nka saa ara anaa
Things happen to us.	Nneɛma to yɛn.
But that wasn’t the point.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
I’m glad I know people who do	M’ani agye sɛ minim nnipa a wɔyɛ saa
I want us to be friends	Mepɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo
But this was not the case.	Nanso na eyi nte saa.
Of course, it should be.	Ampa, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
I’d like more kids	M’ani begye mmofra pii ho
Maybe it will, too.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa nso.
His mind is completely consumed.	N’adwene ayɛ no ma koraa.
That I’m not there anymore.	Sɛ me nni hɔ bio.
I don't really know why and exactly why.	Minnim nea enti ankasa ne nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa.
Our police are no good.	Yɛn polisifo no nyɛ papa biara.
I had to admit it was weird	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ migye tom sɛ na ɛyɛ nwonwa
My only one left.	Me kan biako pɛ a aka.
I have a long day today	Mewɔ da tenten nnɛ
I think you should be for tonight.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ma anadwo yi.
I was planning to go.	Ná mereyɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mɛkɔ.
I echo what almost everyone has said	Meka nea ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara aka no ho asɛm
Check it out here.	Hwɛ mu wɔ ha.
I don’t know many people.	Minnim nnipa pii.
I wanted to know what it was like	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea ɛte
I had to talk to him about something	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa fa biribi ho
That shouldn’t be too surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa kɛse.
It was an easy task.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛnyɛ den.
I don’t know if that’s still the case.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno da so ara te saa anaa.
I wish everyone had started when they were younger	Me yam a anka obiara fii ase bere a na ɔyɛ mmofra no
I felt better after that	Me ho tɔɔ me wɔ ɛno akyi
And he knows me.	Na onim me.
I just need two days	Me hia nna abien pɛ
I sleep for the first time in sleep	Meda nea edi kan wɔ nna mu
I really love how beautiful everything is	M’ani gye sɛnea biribiara yɛ fɛ no ho ankasa
I can certainly provide anything you are interested in	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ metumi de biribiara a wowɔ ho anigye ama
I put it down at the time	Mede too hɔ saa bere no
We can make that happen.	Yebetumi ama ɛno abam.
No one was there for a while.	Ná obiara nni hɔ bere tiaa bi.
I hoped that was all there was to it	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno nkutoo ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ
I still very much hope we were.	Meda so ara wɔ anidaso kɛse sɛ na yɛyɛ saa.
You have to use that	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode saa asɛm no di dwuma
You can tell me about it.	Wubetumi aka akyerɛ me.
It was the same, no doubt.	Saa ara na na ɛte, akyinnye biara nni ho.
Language is a living thing.	Kasa yɛ ade a ɛte ase.
Like there is no tomorrow.	Te sɛ ɔkyena biara nni hɔ.
You have to talk about it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka ho asɛm.
I didn't know how long we did that	Ná minnim bere tenten a yɛde yɛɛ saa
I think we should all have known better	Misusuw sɛ anka ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa hu yiye
We are outside.	Yɛwɔ abɔnten.
It was scary but good.	Ná ɛyɛ hu nanso na eye.
It was a game out.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a wɔde kɔ abɔnten.
He has to call his name.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ ne din.
I want to feel that way again	Mepɛ sɛ mete nka saa bio
I would greatly appreciate all your help.	M’ani begye mo mmoa nyinaa ho kɛse.
One must go home first.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi di kan kɔ fie.
He didn’t always do that.	Ná ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɔyɛ saa.
I always wondered what that was	Ná misusuw nea ɛno yɛ ho bere nyinaa
But I had to be careful	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye
But that was not the case here.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ saa na na ɛte wɔ ha.
He wasn’t the best team it just wasn’t the best team.	Ɔno na ɛnyɛ kuw a eye sen biara no ɛnyɛ kuw a eye sen biara kɛkɛ.
I like the idea but not the implementation	M’ani gye adwene no ho nanso ɛnyɛ nea wɔde bedi dwuma no
In other words, home.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, ofie.
He is the first one.	Ɔno ara ne nea odi kan.
They just say what is there.	Wɔka nea ɛwɔ hɔ ara kwa.
He did what he had to do.	Ɔyɛɛ nea na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I knew he once was	Ná minim sɛ bere bi na ɔyɛ saa
I pointed to the ground	Mede me nsa kyerɛɛ fam
I needed to be more aware of this	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu eyi yiye
You can’t come here.	Worentumi mma ha.
I can't see the error.	Mintumi nhu mfomso no.
That sounds good now.	Ɛno te sɛ nea eye mprempren.
More details next week.	Nsɛm pii wɔ dapɛn a edi hɔ no mu.
It’s too late.	Ɛyɛ nea aka akyi dodo.
And the car was beautiful.	Na na kar no yɛ fɛ yiye.
I wanted to get my mind off things	Ná mepɛ sɛ m’adwene fi nneɛma so
Apparently no one could know about us.	Ɛda adi sɛ na obiara ntumi nhu yɛn ho asɛm.
They either end them or we end us.	Wɔde wɔn ba awiei anaasɛ yɛde yɛn ba awiei.
Put everything down.	Fa biribiara to fam.
I can show you if you want	Metumi akyerɛ wo sɛ wopɛ a
I wanted to see where this would go	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu baabi a eyi bɛkɔ
Nothing seemed to work.	Na ɛte sɛ nea biribiara ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
I have done this before.	Mayɛ eyi pɛn.
They were good kids.	Ná wɔyɛ mmofra pa.
You know the truth.	Wunim nokware no.
However, it has power.	Nanso, ɛwɔ tumi.
Many times he leaned closer to me.	Mpɛn pii na ɔde ne ho too me nkyɛn kɛse.
Thank you for what you do.	Meda wo ase wɔ nea woyɛ no ho.
I couldn’t believe it	Ná mintumi nnye nni
But there was one more thing.	Nanso na ade biako bio wɔ hɔ.
So that would be one way.	Enti ɛno bɛyɛ ɔkwan biako.
The front room looked empty.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea hwee nni anim dan no mu.
We do a lot more now.	Yɛyɛ pii sen saa mprempren.
I wanted to say more too	Me nso na mepɛ sɛ meka kɛse
You can see me.	Wubetumi ahu me.
I wonder how bad that must be for them	Misusuw sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ bɔne ma wɔn no ho
I am a person who.	Meyɛ obi a.
I knew nothing about sex	Ná minnim nna ho hwee
I wonder if you even know their names	Misusuw sɛ ebia wunim wɔn din mpo anaa
I plan on taking the test at some point	Meyɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mɛyɛ sɔhwɛ no wɔ bere bi mu
I talked at length with each of you	Me ne mo mu biara kaa ho asɛm tenten
It was a long story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm tenten bi.
Now I am in the same predicament as my father	Seesei mewɔ ɔhaw koro no ara a me papa wɔ no mu
I hear they do so much	Mete sɛ wɔyɛ pii saa
You look great, and we do what we do best.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ yiye, na yɛyɛ nea yɛyɛ yiye sen biara.
One doesn’t really need that.	Obi nhia saa ankasa.
It was his father.	Ná ɛyɛ ne papa.
I hurried home to you	Meyɛɛ ntɛm baa fie baa wo nkyɛn
I love the atmosphere	M’ani gye tebea a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho
One thing was out there.	Ná ade biako wɔ abɔnten.
I knew that right now	Ná minim saa mprempren ara
Keep things simple.	Fa nneɛma yɛɛ mmerɛw.
I think that’s a mistake	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ mfomso
That’s just me.	Ɛno ne me nkutoo.
I had nothing to offer that everyone here wanted	Ná minni biribiara a mede bɛma a obiara a ɔwɔ ha pɛ
This makes me us now.	Eyi ma meyɛ yɛn mprempren.
This approach was very successful.	Saa kwan yi dii yiye kɛse.
There was nothing left.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a aka.
I saw them all too well	Mihuu wɔn nyinaa yiye dodo
Not a while ago.	Ɛnyɛ bere tiaa bi a atwam ni.
The result is always disastrous.	Nea afi mu aba ne asiane bere nyinaa.
That’s a lot of it.	Ɛno yɛ pii.
This is the end of our story.	Eyi ne yɛn asɛm no na aba awiei.
I was lying on the floor	Ná meda fam
I had to admire him for that	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani gye ne ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho
Or at least it hurts a lot.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛyɛ no yaw kɛse.
I thought about that a long time ago	Misusuw saa asɛm no ho bere tenten a atwam ni
I can hazard a point	Metumi de asɛm bi ahyɛ asiane mu
Maybe there was a party going on.	Ebia na apontow bi rekɔ so.
Everything is on the table.	Biribiara wɔ pon no so.
I stepped closer	Mede me nan bɛn ho
I had no job at all	Ná minni adwuma biara koraa
The fact is, you can.	Nea ɛyɛ nokware no, wubetumi.
It was a great game.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru kɛse bi.
I have nothing else to tell you	Minni biribi foforo a mɛka akyerɛ wo
I know what he is planning	Minim nea ɔreyɛ ho nhyehyɛe
Nothing too exciting.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ anigye dodo.
I kept my eyes on him	Mede m’ani sii no so
You don’t need to bring anything.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode biribiara bɛba.
He obviously knew.	Ɛda adi sɛ na onim.
And I’m not alone either.	Na ɛnyɛ me nkutoo nso.
Is this just as good.	So eyi yɛ papa saa ara.
I couldn’t help myself.	Na mintumi nyɛ me ho hwee.
There is a place.	Baabi wɔ hɔ.
However, I can't seem to get it to work.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea mintumi mma ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I have an important meeting tomorrow.	Mewɔ nhyiam bi a ɛho hia ɔkyena.
However, it is no longer the case.	Nanso, ɛnte saa bio.
However, this is not the case here.	Nanso, eyi nte saa wɔ ha.
I wanted more than that	Ná mepɛ pii sen saa
I think this may be the problem.	Misusuw sɛ ebia eyi ne ɔhaw no.
Maybe one day when this was all over.	Ebia da koro bi a na eyi nyinaa aba awiei no.
I should have told him	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no
I think you bring up a really good point there.	Misusuw sɛ wode asɛm bi a eye ankasa ba hɔ.
It’s just a matter of planning.	Ɛyɛ nhyehyɛe ho asɛm ara kwa.
Just the one I wanted to watch.	Nea na mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ no nkutoo.
I glanced at them	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ wɔn
I owe you an apology	Mede wo ka sɛ mepa wo kyɛw
I saw them through the window	Mihuu wɔn wɔ mfɛnsere no mu
I really like this idea.	M’ani gye saa adwene yi ho ankasa.
I’m interested in that.	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
Thank you both of you.	Meda mo baanu nyinaa ase.
There was no dog.	Ná ɔkraman biara nni hɔ.
However, I can’t say it anymore	Nanso, mintumi nka bio
I wondered how it would feel.	Misusuw sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ te nka ho.
In those days, I knew your mother.	Saa nna no mu no, na minim wo maame.
I could use some help	Ná metumi de mmoa bi adi dwuma
I leaned against my desk	Mede me ho too me pon so
I think everyone has so that can’t be it	Misusuw sɛ obiara wɔ bi enti ɛno ntumi nyɛ saa
That means something alive is happening.	Ɛno kyerɛ sɛ biribi a nkwa wom rekɔ so.
Thank you very much.	Meda yiye.
He should have felt pain.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte yaw nka.
None of them ever made it home.	Wɔn mu biara antumi ankɔ fie da.
The rest should speak for itself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nea aka no kasa ma ne ho.
Tell me a little about that.	Ka saa asɛm no ho asɛm kakra kyerɛ me.
It’s just part of who he is.	Ɛyɛ onipa a ɔyɛ no fã bi kɛkɛ.
I just copied everyone else	Meyɛɛ obiara a aka no ho mfonini kɛkɛ
No one is in the lead.	Obiara nni anim.
He was interested in that.	Ná n’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
I’m not sure about it.	M’ani nnye ho wɔ ho.
This is our team.	Eyi ne yɛn kuw no.
You can see it too.	Wubetumi ahu nso.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni ho.
He seemed really familiar.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onim no yiye ankasa.
But this must be done.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi.
We like the atmosphere.	Yɛn ani gye tebea a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho.
But not for very long.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bere tenten paa.
He'll tell me if he's wet.	Ɔbɛka akyerɛ me sɛ wayɛ nsu a.
In front of them, there is nothing.	Wɔ wɔn anim no, biribiara nni hɔ.
Besides, maybe that was his plan.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, ebia na ɛno ne ne nhyehyɛe.
I don’t have anything about it anymore.	Minni ho hwee bio.
I went with him still	Me ne no kɔɔ da so ara
I don’t have to tell people about it	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meka ho asɛm kyerɛ nkurɔfo
A lot of it comes down to planning	Ne fã kɛse no ara ba nhyehyɛe a wɔyɛ so
I still have school in the morning	Meda so ara wɔ sukuu anɔpa
This is why he is here.	Eyi nti na ɔwɔ ha.
I just wasn’t that person.	Ná menyɛ saa onipa no ara kwa.
It seems to be the same.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
It doesn’t have to be expensive.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ne bo yɛ den.
I'm watching it closely	Mehwɛ no yiye
I had it to myself for two whole hours	Ná mewɔ no ma me ho nnɔnhwerew abien mũ nyinaa
You can find it scary if you want.	Wubetumi ahu sɛ ɛyɛ hu sɛ wopɛ a.
Look at their faces.	Hwɛ wɔn anim.
I must have heard them at night	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ metee wɔn anadwo
I would have been terrified there with him.	Anka me ne no bɛbɔ hu wɔ hɔ.
I was unaware of their plan	Ná minnim wɔn nhyehyɛe no
She’s beautiful.	Ɔyɛ fɛ.
But it can be done on its own.	Nanso ne ankasa ankasa betumi ayɛ saa.
I know it’s hard	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ den
And I still don’t know who did it	Na meda so ara nhu onii a ɔyɛɛ saa
His father was right.	Ná ne papa asɛm no yɛ nokware.
But it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛnte saa.
I knew he was one of us	Ná minim sɛ ɔyɛ yɛn mu biako
I think that was too obvious	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno da adi dodo
I hadn't even thought about that	Ná minsusuw saa asɛm no ho mpo
you forget about him.	wo werɛ mfi no.
It will be difficult.	Ɛbɛyɛ den.
All I know is that you shouldn’t	Nea minim ara ne sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa
An accident happened.	Akwanhyia bi sii.
I actually made a plan of action	Meyɛɛ nhyehyɛe bi ankasa sɛ mɛyɛ ade
But life is what you make it.	Nanso nkwa ne nea woyɛ no.
I can’t think of anything	Mintumi nsusuw biribiara ho
I guess it doesn’t matter now	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee mprempren
The house seemed empty.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea obiara nni fie hɔ.
Couldn’t get inside.	Antumi ankɔ mu.
It’s a part of me.	Ɛyɛ me fã bi.
I had to look into this	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ eyi mu
I have to do enough for you	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nea ɛdɔɔso ma wo
I have to work this evening	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma anwummere yi
We are better than that.	Yɛyɛ papa sen saa.
I think he’ll be fine	Misusuw sɛ ɔbɛyɛ yiye
And you can show how strong you are too.	Na wubetumi akyerɛ sɛnea wo nso wo ho yɛ den.
I wonder how many languages ​​he speaks	Misusuw kasa dodow a ɔka ho
Not much, ultimately.	Ɛnyɛ pii, awiei koraa no.
This bothers me.	Eyi haw me.
They didn’t matter.	Ná wɔn ho nhia.
He seemed interested, too.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani gye ho, nso.
He knew what was going on.	Ná onim nea ɛrekɔ so.
I think it’s absolutely necessary and important.	Misusuw sɛ ɛho hia koraa na ɛho hia.
He wants to talk to you about it.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne wo kasa fa ho.
We can get that here.	Yebetumi anya saa wɔ ha.
I just have to trust you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede me ho to wo so ara kwa.
He has nonsense.	Ɔwɔ nsɛm a ɛnyɛ hwee.
I didn’t want to see him.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu no.
I tell them everything	Meka biribiara kyerɛ wɔn
He loved all of that.	Ná n’ani gye saa nneɛma no nyinaa ho.
But we have what we have.	Nanso yɛwɔ nea yɛwɔ.
His hand was warm to hers.	Ná ne nsa yɛ hyew wɔ ne de no ho.
That’s what the city does to you.	Saa na kurow no yɛ wo.
Otherwise, it wasn’t.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, na ɛnte saa.
I knew how this ended	Ná minim sɛnea eyi baa awiei
But that issue is not before us.	Nanso saa asɛm no nni yɛn anim.
But who else .	Nanso hena bio .
I really think you will	Misusuw ankasa sɛ wobɛyɛ saa
But it doesn’t matter to me.	Nanso ɛnyɛ me asɛm.
I want it done right.	Mepɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no yiye.
He was really strong.	Ná ne ho yɛ den ankasa.
I stayed with him	Me ne no traa hɔ
I don’t want an accident here.	Mempɛ akwanhyia bi wɔ ha.
I could have just shown him	Anka metumi akyerɛ no ara kwa
I shouldn’t have been able to see you	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ metumi ahu wo
However, this was not the case.	Nanso, na eyi nte saa.
Not now, and not later.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren, na ɛnyɛ akyiri yi nso.
He heads away.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛ baabi foforo.
And it’s just like you say.	Na ɛte sɛ nea woka no ara pɛ.
Many of our friends are unemployed	Yɛn nnamfo pii nni adwuma
I can’t tell you more about it	Mintumi nka ho nsɛm pii nkyerɛ wo
I want her to be my wife	Mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ me yere
A little bit of everything and everything	Biribiara ne biribiara ho kakra
You seem to be about my height.	Ɛte sɛ nea woyɛ bɛyɛ me tenten.
So they use it almost every day.	Enti ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma da biara da.
I wasn’t even thinking about it the whole time	Ná minsusuw ho mpo bere no nyinaa
He wasn't alone and alone.	Ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na na ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
A lot had started here.	Ná nneɛma pii afi ase wɔ ha.
I was.	Na me.
I just had a slight headache, that’s all	Me ti yɛɛ me yaw kakra kɛkɛ, ɛno ara ne no
They were definitely good.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na wɔyɛ papa.
I put the paper down.	Mede krataa no too fam.
I liked that story	M’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho
It was just a day out.	Ná ɛyɛ da koro pɛ a wɔde fi adi.
Time for reflection	Bere a wɔde susuw nneɛma ho
But he didn’t know.	Nanso na onnim.
You are.	Woyɛ.
I was very impressed	M’ani gyee ho kɛse
Being a good person means nothing.	Onipa pa a obi bɛyɛ no nkyerɛ hwee.
There is nothing else like it.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ ɛno.
I squinted at him	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ no
It was very wet.	Na ɛyɛ nsu paa.
I ran to look at him quickly	Mede mmirika hwɛɛ no ​​ntɛmntɛm
I really like a lot of the group	M’ani gye kuw no mu pii ho ankasa
Or anytime, for that matter.	Anaasɛ bere biara, ɛno nti.
I am an expert at it.	Meyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw wɔ ho.
With one hand.	Ɔde ne nsa biako.
Which I could only hope was all for naught	Nea na metumi anya anidaso sɛ ne nyinaa yɛ kwa
But it’s not what matters to him.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia no.
He wasn’t doing well.	Ná ɔnyɛ yiye.
I was the only one watching the door	Ná me nkutoo na mehwɛ ɔpon no ano
But there was no one there.	Nanso na obiara nni hɔ.
But there is something else.	Nanso biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
I have high hopes for you	Mewɔ anidaso kɛse ma mo
But everything inside was there.	Nanso na biribiara a ɛwɔ mu no wɔ hɔ.
I could think of nothing else	Ná mintumi nsusuw biribi foforo biara ho
I think it’s very, very likely.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye, yiye.
We must never forget.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛn werɛ fi da.
I can’t talk about this now	Mintumi nka eyi ho asɛm mprempren
It’s not a mistake.	Ɛnyɛ mfomso.
I really didn’t know what to say to him	Ankasa na minnim nea mɛka akyerɛ no
Or something like that.	Anaasɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
The car is.	Kar no.
But he knew it himself.	Nanso na ɔno ankasa nim.
People needed something like that.	Ná nkurɔfo hia ade a ɛte saa.
But the problem goes deeper than this.	Nanso ɔhaw no kɔ akyiri sen eyi.
But it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛnte saa.
I played with it	Mede dii agoru
I think there are two pairs	Misusuw sɛ abien abien na ɛwɔ hɔ
That would be something.	Ɛno bɛyɛ biribi.
But something else just happened.	Nanso biribi foforo sii ara kwa.
I knew what was going on here	Ná minim nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha
We are all trying.	Yɛn nyinaa rebɔ mmɔden.
I did that.	Meyɛɛ saa.
I was on the floor of my living room	Ná mewɔ me dan mu fam
I can't deal with this right now	Mintumi nni eyi ho dwuma mprempren
There weren’t many good people.	Ná nnipa pa pii nni hɔ.
I’m the one who made them.	Me na mewɔ wo.
I really like it when he gets jealous	M’ani gye ho ankasa bere a n’ani bere no
He glanced into their eyes.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ wɔn ani so.
I couldn’t but that was his problem, not mine	Na mintumi nanso ɛno ne ne haw, ɛnyɛ me de
It was never background music.	Na ɛnyɛ nnwom a ɛwɔ akyi da.
It had just gone away.	Ná akɔ ara kwa.
I hope you can handle that one	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi adi saa biako no ho dwuma
He was obviously forgotten by his people.	Ná ɛda adi sɛ ne nkurɔfo werɛ fi no.
I do all these things	Meyɛ saa nneɛma yi nyinaa
We have two cars in there right now.	Yɛwɔ kar abien wɔ hɔ mprempren ara.
I need to end it before it goes too far	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede ba awiei ansa na akɔ akyiri dodo
I didn’t think he had it in him	Na minsusuw sɛ ɔwɔ bi wɔ ne mu
I should have stayed with you	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo tra
Consider the last two points.	Susuw nsɛm abien a etwa to no ho hwɛ.
Very tall man, quick on his feet.	Ɔbarima tenten paa, ɔyɛ ntɛm wɔ ne nan so.
I had nothing on me.	Ná minni hwee wɔ me so.
I wanted to talk to you before the police did	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa ansa na polisifo ayɛ saa
I will give the winner	Mede nea odi nkonim no bɛma
I almost wish there was	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ me yam a anka ɛwɔ hɔ
This takes time.	Eyi gye bere.
I am three hours late for work	Meka akyi nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa wɔ adwuma mu
He touched his hat.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne kyɛw no.
And it wasn’t all that bad.	Na na ɛnyɛ ne nyinaa bɔne saa.
I don’t think it’s about him	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ ne ho asɛm
I can handle him.	Metumi adi ne ho dwuma.
It’s a group.	Ɛyɛ kuw bi.
There were several of them.	Ná wɔn mu dodow bi wɔ hɔ.
The next thing is.	Ade a edi hɔ ne sɛ.
Tell us why.	Ka nea enti a ɛte saa kyerɛ yɛn.
It’s just too bad.	Ɛyɛ bɔne dodo ara kwa.
But he feels happy.	Nanso ɔte nka sɛ ɔwɔ anigye.
I shouldn’t have dealt with him	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ me ne no di nsɛm
He was a man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima.
I really think he needs to talk to someone	Misusuw ankasa sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne obi kasa
The name of the movie is not convincing to me.	Sini no din nyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware mma me.
It is also unpopular.	Ɛyɛ nea nkurɔfo ani nnye ho nso.
I know what they do	Minim nea wɔyɛ
However, it was only two years ago.	Nanso, ɛyɛ mfe abien pɛ a atwam ni.
This was new to me.	Ná eyi yɛ ade foforo ma me.
I definitely wanted to do that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
Or he knew something about her.	Anaasɛ na onim biribi fa ne ho.
I couldn’t allow myself to do this	Na mintumi mma me ho kwan mma menyɛ eyi
At least not all of them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ wɔn nyinaa.
I need to talk to him	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa
I didn’t even have to say it	Ná enhia sɛ meka mpo
They were included.	Wɔde wɔn kaa ho.
At the meeting, he was excited.	Wɔ nhyiam no ase no, na n’ani agye.
If you find mistakes, you can tell me.	Sɛ wuhu mfomso ahorow a, wubetumi aka akyerɛ me.
I don’t know why it didn’t.	Minnim nea enti a anyɛ saa.
I wish him success	Mepɛ sɛ odi yiye
These people are my people.	Saa nkurɔfo yi ne me nkurɔfo.
No doubt he did.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
I absolutely love this one	M’ani gye eyi ho koraa
I am well aware of that.	Me nim saa asɛm no yiye.
Does it really exist???.	So ɛwɔ hɔ ampa???.
They were realistic.	Ná wɔyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
It’s just a beautiful story.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa.
But this seems not to have been the case.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea na eyi nte saa.
We put our money where our mouth is.	Yɛde yɛn sika to baabi a yɛn ano wɔ.
A man.	Onipa bi.
After our first article.	Yɛn asɛm a edi kan no akyi.
If you can get one.	Sɛ wubetumi anya bi a.
He was a human being.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa.
You can check it out.	Wubetumi ahwɛ mu.
I paint quite a bit and would love to do more	Meyɛ mfonini kakra na m’ani begye ho sɛ mɛyɛ pii
I couldn’t sleep and you were doing fine	Na mintumi nna na na woreyɛ yiye
I believe there must be a place for you .	Migye di sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ baabi wɔ hɔ ma wo .
For him, however, this is not a problem.	Nanso, wɔ ne fam no, eyi nyɛ ɔhaw.
Their whole lives lay ahead of them.	Na wɔn nkwa nyinaa da wɔn anim.
What you do matters.	Nea woyɛ no ho hia.
I stayed with him for a while.	Me ne no traa hɔ kakra.
They are cheap and awesome.	Wɔn bo nyɛ den na ɛyɛ hu.
I loved those pictures	Ná mepɛ saa mfonini ahorow no ho asɛm
Or better yet, half of one.	Anaasɛ nea eye sen saa no, biako fã.
I hope you enjoy them	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye wɔn ho
You are not what you believe.	Wonyɛ nea wugye di.
But it’s not for me.	Nanso ɛnyɛ me fam.
They must have been strong.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na wɔn ho yɛ den.
I need to talk to him and make sure	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa na mehwɛ hu sɛ
I'm up for that too.	Me nso mewɔ hɔ ma ɛno.
We had cars.	Ná yɛwɔ kar ahorow.
I didn't want to think about that right now	Ná mempɛ sɛ misusuw saa asɛm no ho mprempren ara
I couldn't believe how much he had grown	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛnea wayɛ kɛse no
It was a great city.	Ná ɛyɛ kurow kɛse bi.
I felt something give	Metee nka sɛ biribi ma
I understood that he liked me.	Metee ase sɛ n’ani gye me ho.
No one else has that kind of happiness.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔwɔ anigye a ɛte saa.
They had to be put down.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn to fam.
This helps.	Eyi mmoa.
Maybe I should make one one day	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biako da koro
I can’t believe how time has gone	Mintumi nnye sɛnea bere akɔ so no nni
I have only known him for a short time	Bere tiaa bi pɛ na minim no
Take this.	Fa eyi.
But you know someone.	Nanso wunim obi.
The people who have to work for them are not so lucky.	Nnipa a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma ma wɔn no nni anigye saa.
I guess tomorrow is another day.	Misusuw sɛ ɔkyena yɛ da foforo.
I love animals and music	M’ani gye mmoa ne nnwom ho
I think he does have a point there	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ asɛm bi wɔ hɔ ampa
I'm just lying there.	Meda hɔ ara kwa.
I used it to see if there were any issues	Mede hwɛɛ sɛ ebia nsɛm bi wɔ hɔ anaa
They will be more comfortable with it.	Wɔn ho bɛtɔ wɔn kɛse wɔ ho.
No doubt he hoped so.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
I couldn’t even think about that	Na mintumi mpo nsusuw saa asɛm no ho
I understand now that it is not.	Mete ase mprempren sɛ ɛnte saa.
Mary is from that city.	Maria fi saa kurow no mu.
Discuss it with yourself.	Wo ne wo nsusuw ho.
He had been a very willing participant, too.	Ná wayɛ obi a ɔwɔ ɔpɛ kɛse sɛ ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu, nso.
It’s a point to think about, definitely.	Ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho, akyinnye biara nni ho.
There was no doubt about it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I can go along with that too	Me nso metumi ne saa tebea no akɔ
My head is still on this one.	Me ti da so ara wɔ eyi so.
, is still valid.	, no da so ara yɛ adwuma.
But you can get a glimpse of it.	Nanso wubetumi anya ho asɛm kakra.
I never thought of it that way.	Minsusuw ho saa da.
I always watch how you do that	Mehwɛ sɛnea woyɛ saa bere nyinaa
Once again, someone closed the door behind them.	Saa bere yi nso, obi too ɔpon no mu wɔ wɔn akyi.
I had power over them	Ná mewɔ tumi wɔ wɔn so
Participants were alone in the room.	Ná wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ mu no nkutoo wɔ dan no mu.
I didn’t want to do that either	Ná me nso mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa
That will make us more targeted.	Ɛno bɛma wɔde wɔn ani asi yɛn so kɛse.
I put him there next to my wife	Mede ne ho too me yere nkyɛn wɔ hɔ
He wants to talk to one of your dogs.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne wo kraman no mu biako kasa.
I love any or all of the information	M’ani gye nsɛm biara anaa ne nyinaa ho
For the latter, no problem.	Wɔ nea etwa to no ho no, ɔhaw biara nni ho.
I don’t care when it is	Bere a ɛyɛ no mfa me ho
Set aside some of the stuffing.	Fa nea wode ahyɛ mu no bi to nkyɛn.
There is too much if this is happening.	Ɛwɔ hɔ dodo sɛ eyi rekɔ so a.
I'm here with you	Me na me ne wo wɔ ha
He seemed very happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye yiye.
And maybe another one after that.	Na ebia foforo nso wɔ ɛno akyi.
Doubt.	Nnye nni.
It was something to look forward to, too.	Na ɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ kwan, nso.
I always do, always have, always will	Meyɛ bere nyinaa, bere nyinaa mewɔ, bere nyinaa mɛyɛ saa
Not even us.	Ɛnyɛ yɛn mpo.
He is not a bad person.	Ɛnyɛ onipa bɔne.
I still wanted to be with him.	Ná meda so ara pɛ sɛ me ne no bɔ.
I know we are perfect for each other	Minim sɛ yɛyɛ pɛ ma yɛn ho yɛn ho
Pictures will be available soon.	Mfonini ahorow bɛba nnansa yi ara.
I can barely see it now	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nhu no mprempren
I didn’t even have to say anything	Ná enhia sɛ meka hwee mpo
I think it might be something better.	Misusuw sɛ ebia ɛbɛyɛ biribi a eye sen saa.
What was it like.	Ná ɛyɛ dɛn.
He was a little too independent.	Ná ɔde ne ho dodo kakra.
I loved being with him	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ me ne no bɛbɔ
I would do anything for him.	Anka mɛyɛ biribiara ama no.
I don’t know why anyone would want this job.	Minnim nea enti a obi bɛpɛ adwuma yi.
That was a while ago.	Ɛno yɛ bere bi a atwam ni.
None of that is in this dish.	Ɛno mu biara nni saa aduan yi mu.
I believed there was something	Ná migye di sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ
I think he’s jealous	Misusuw sɛ n’ani bere
I think it doesn’t matter much	Misusuw sɛ ɛho nhia pii
It’s like a game.	Ɛte sɛ agoru bi.
But nothing seems to help.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea biribiara mmoa.
But it wasn’t a thing.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ade.
I didn’t know where I was.	Ná minnim baabi a mewɔ.
We admire them both.	Yɛn ani gye wɔn baanu nyinaa ho.
I’m so excited about that.	M’ani agye saa asɛm no ho yiye.
I have a lot of work to do here	Mewɔ adwuma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ wɔ ha
Or maybe he had children.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɔwɔ mma.
You seem more powerful that way.	Ɛte sɛ nea wowɔ tumi kɛse wɔ saa kwan no so.
I want to talk to you about that	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa fa saa asɛm no ho
I just had to be careful	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye ara kwa
You have it now.	Wowɔ bi mprempren.
But it would have been dangerous.	Nanso anka ɛbɛyɛ asiane.
No one has a problem with that.	Obiara nni ɔhaw wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I point to my feet	Mede me nsa kyerɛ me nan ase
I head in his direction	Mede m’ani kyerɛ ne kwan so
Any major city.	Kurow kɛse biara.
I am very worried about him	Ne ho asɛm haw me paa
I seemed to have to do that more often lately	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa mpɛn pii nnansa yi
Which is not what I want.	Nea ɛnyɛ nea mepɛ.
The plan didn’t work.	Nhyehyɛe no anyɛ adwuma.
In any case, he knew.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, na onim.
And it’s a plus.	Na ɛyɛ nea wɔde ka ho.
So go after someone.	Enti kɔ di obi akyi.
Set aside some money.	Fa sika bi to nkyɛn.
I wasn’t supposed to like this	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ m’ani gye eyi ho
They were interested in it.	Ná wɔn ani gye ho.
I wanted my pain to end	Ná mepɛ sɛ me yaw no ba awiei
Surely that might be the case.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ebia ɛno bɛyɛ saa.
In a way, we are a little imperfect ourselves.	Ɔkwan bi so no, yɛn ankasa nni mũ kakra.
No one talks much about anything interesting.	Obiara nka biribi a ɛyɛ anigye ho asɛm pii.
I had to see this man	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu ɔbarima yi
I don’t have to think about it.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
But there is no time.	Nanso bere nni hɔ.
We are perfect.	Yɛyɛ pɛ.
He wanted something.	Ná ɔpɛ biribi.
I'm sorry you had to know that	Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu saa
I don’t know if that’s really the case.	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛte saa ankasa anaa.
It’s just a way.	Ɛyɛ ɔkwan bi kɛkɛ.
I looked like a different person	Ná me ho te sɛ onipa foforo
Do them for a long time.	Yɛ wɔn bere tenten.
In its own right.	Wɔ ne kwan so.
Comfortable walking shoes	Mpaboa a ɛyɛ fɛ a wɔde nantew
I can’t do it anymore.	Mintumi nyɛ bio.
He had plenty of time.	Ná ɔwɔ bere pii.
We had one skull on top of another	Ná yɛwɔ ti nhwi bi wɔ foforo so
This makes things very easy.	Eyi ma nneɛma yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
That was the first time for all of us.	Ɛno ne bere a edi kan ma yɛn nyinaa.
I made up names for each of them	Meyɛɛ din ahorow maa wɔn mu biara
There is very little money left	Sika kakraa bi pɛ na aka
I could barely sleep after a night like that.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nna wɔ anadwo a ɛte saa akyi.
Which was a huge mistake.	Nea na ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
We both win.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa di nkonim.
I just thought this should go into a song.	Misusuwii ara ne sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ eyi kɔ dwom bi mu.
From time to time, someone would call his name.	Bere ne bere mu no, na obi bɛbɔ ne din.
Every day of the week.	Da biara da wɔ dapɛn no mu.
The same night.	Anadwo koro no ara.
I was shocked, to be honest	Me ho dwiriw me, sɛ mɛka nokware a
I think this guy had been watching her	Misusuw sɛ na saa ɔbarima yi ahwɛ no
Or he can have both.	Anaasɛ obetumi anya abien no nyinaa.
I set aside some food for you	Mede aduan bi to nkyɛn ma wo
This idea is too simplistic.	Saa adwene yi yɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
I’m in love with him.	M’ani gyee ne ho.
This was not easy.	Ná eyi nyɛ mmerɛw.
Her hair was wet.	Ná ne ti nhwi ayɛ nsu.
We seem to do well.	Ɛte sɛ nea yɛyɛ yiye.
He knows now, somehow.	Onim mprempren, ɔkwan bi so.
Thank you all so much.	Meda mo nyinaa ase pii.
All that we use every day in such a time.	Nea yɛde di dwuma da biara wɔ bere a ɛte saa mu nyinaa.
So many things.	Nneɛma pii saa.
A door, it seemed	Ɔpon bi, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte
I really didn’t know why	Ankasa na minnim nea enti a ɛte saa
The first part of the book was amazing.	Ná nhoma no fã a edi kan no yɛ nwonwa.
Maybe there was a face.	Ebia na anim bi wɔ hɔ.
I thought it looked complicated	Misusuwii sɛ na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den
Just wanted to see what my best option is now.	Kɛkɛ na mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ nea me kwan a eye sen biara ne mprempren.
It’s a really tough time.	Ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ den ankasa.
That was us then.	Ɛno ne yɛn saa bere no.
The rest is complicated.	Nea aka no yɛ nea ɛyɛ den.
I thought but wanted to say	Misusuwii nanso na mepɛ sɛ meka
I really did him wrong	Meyɛɛ no ​​bɔne ankasa
Let yourself know.	Ma wo ho nhu.
I can’t see anything outside	Mintumi nhu biribi wɔ abɔnten
Maybe none of it helps.	Ebia mu biara mmoa.
I thought you had power	Misusuwii sɛ wowɔ tumi
Before tomorrow afternoon.	Ansa na ɔkyena awia adu.
They are soft and even warm.	Wɔyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ hyew mpo.
It seems like a very long time.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ bere tenten paa.
It’s still so new.	Ɛda so ara yɛ foforo saa.
I was a really bad kid	Ná meyɛ abofra bɔne ankasa
Put me on.	Fa me hyɛ.
I looked down at the ground	Mede m’ani sii fam
I can't believe this worked	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ eyi yɛɛ adwuma
Or so it seemed to me.	Anaasɛ na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ me.
But that didn’t mean he liked it.	Nanso na ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ n’ani gye ho.
So, take it away.	Enti, fa kɔ.
Before you can be good, you have to be bad.	Ansa na wobɛyɛ papa no, ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ bɔne.
I couldn’t understand them	Ná mintumi nte wɔn ase
This was the situation.	Ná tebea no ne eyi.
My mother did that.	Me maame yɛɛ saa.
I should have been careful	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye
I want to say how wonderful you all are	Mepɛ sɛ meka sɛnea mo nyinaa ho yɛ nwonwa no
Either way, it’s over.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, aba awiei.
You were terrible before.	Ná wo ho yɛ hu pɛn.
I put my head in my hands	Mede me ti too me nsa so
I was a very bright kid	Ná meyɛ abofra a me ho akokwaw yiye
However, I understand	Nanso, mete ase
You know what it is.	Wunim nea ɛyɛ.
Not in that way anyway.	Ɛnyɛ saa kwan no so ɔkwan biara so.
Day and night, it’s always the same.	Awia ne anadwo, ɛyɛ ade koro bere nyinaa.
I had to do what I had to do.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
Like a good boy.	Te sɛ abarimaa pa.
At least part of you still does.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wo fã bi da so ara yɛ saa.
I need to know where this is going down	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu baabi a eyi rekɔ fam
But this is the point.	Nanso eyi ne asɛm no.
That’s the time.	Ɛno ne bere no.
I have nothing to do with it	Me ne no nni hwee
That’s when the bottom fell out.	Ɛno na ase no hwee ase.
I won with you	Me ne wo dii nkonim
I want to be there for her	Mepɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ ma no
I had no idea about that.	Ná minni saa asɛm no ho adwene biara.
Tomorrow is the day.	Ɔkyena ne da no.
I forgot where it was	Me werɛ fii baabi a na ɛwɔ
And something went wrong.	Na biribi ankɔ yiye.
I just want you to be happy but be careful	Mepɛ sɛ w’ani gye kɛkɛ nanso hwɛ yiye
The idea of ​​something else.	Biribi foforo ho adwene.
A few interesting points have been made	Wɔde nsɛm kakraa bi a ɛyɛ anigye aba
But it was his, all of it.	Nanso na ɛyɛ ne de, ne nyinaa.
I stare at the ground	Mehwɛ fam denneennen
I know what to look out for	Minim nea ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye
We are too strong.	Yɛyɛ den dodo.
I had to sleep	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meda
However, there is no information about this.	Nanso, eyi ho nsɛm biara nni hɔ.
He had to play with himself.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho di agoru wɔ ne ho mu.
I'm saying this.	Meka eyi.
Just be careful with him.	Hwɛ yiye wɔ ne ho ara kwa.
He was strong and very handsome.	Ná ne ho yɛ den na ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I know there was food here last week	Minim sɛ na aduan wɔ ha dapɛn a etwaam no
I know your mother knows that	Minim sɛ wo maame nim saa
At least that seems unlikely.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
I’m a happy guy.	M’ani gye anigye ho.
A lot had happened.	Ná nneɛma pii asi.
That makes me happy.	Ɛno ma m’ani gye.
He hoped it was.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
I hope that's okay with you	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno nyɛ hwee wɔ wo ho
Eventually, he can do well.	Awiei koraa no, obetumi ayɛ yiye.
I can’t get it wrong on anything.	Me ntumi nnya no mfomso wɔ biribiara so.
I didn’t know what to do with me	Ná minnim nea mede bɛyɛ me
Three different viewing angles.	Nneɛma ahorow abiɛsa a wɔde hwɛ ade.
Too much now.	Ɛdɔɔso dodo mprempren.
But only if it will be some good.	Nanso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ papa bi nkutoo a.
It is completely outdated.	Ɛyɛ nea ne bere atwam koraa.
I know that now more than ever	Minim saa mprempren sen bere biara
I believe it was indeed an accident	Migye di sɛ na ɛyɛ akwanhyia ampa
I wanted to feel you	Ná mepɛ sɛ mete wo nka
Many people couldn’t keep up with him.	Nnipa pii antumi ankɔ so ne no abɔ.
He was casual, happy.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔnyɛ hwee, na n’ani gye.
I don’t like pretty people.	M’ani nnye nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ ho.
But maybe not either.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ saa nso.
So the week.	Enti dapɛn no.
However, current usage remains experimental.	Nanso, mprempren de di dwuma no da so ara yɛ sɔhwɛ.
I can’t even say I’m sorry.	Mintumi nka mpo sɛ mepa wo kyɛw.
I know your services are very expensive	Minim sɛ mo nnwuma no bo yɛ den yiye
You can’t tell what he thought about that.	Worentumi nhu nea na osusuw wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I hope you enjoy it here	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho wɔ ha
Or maybe he’ll bring you to him.	Anaasɛ ebia ɔde wo bɛba ne nkyɛn.
I quite like the way it looks	M’ani gye sɛnea ɛte no ho yiye
Nothing comes through.	Biribiara mfa mu mma.
Neither were his friends.	Saa ara nso na na ne nnamfo nyɛ saa.
That taught them.	Ɛno kyerɛɛ wɔn.
See, this is important, you know.	Hwɛ, eyi ho hia, wunim.
I think he already knew	Misusuw sɛ na onim dedaw
I know them well	Minim wɔn yiye
I think he was doing it again	Misusuw sɛ na ɔreyɛ bio
However, I haven’t	Nanso, m’ani nyɛɛ m’ani
There is nothing wrong with it.	Biribiara nni ho.
He was very interested in that.	Ná n’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho kɛse.
They were hairy.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ nhwi.
This is just another one of those things	Eyi yɛ saa nneɛma no mu biako foforo ara kwa
Never.	Da.
Nevertheless, he knew it was there.	Ne nyinaa mu no, na onim sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
I can’t get them.	Mintumi nnya wɔn.
This was the perfect time.	Ná eyi ne bere a ɛyɛ pɛ.
No one really told him.	Obiara ankasa ankyerɛ no.
Go back inside.	San kɔ mu.
One opportunity cannot trump another.	Hokwan biako ntumi nni hokwan foforo so nkonim.
This worked for him.	Eyi yɛɛ adwuma maa no.
I love it when he touches me	M’ani gye ho bere a ɔde ne nsa ka me no
A few of them came.	Wɔn mu kakraa bi baa hɔ.
I cannot, nor can any man.	Mintumi, na saa ara nso na ɔbarima biara ntumi nyɛ saa.
I didn’t know what that meant	Ná minnim nea ɛno kyerɛ
There was no test for them.	Ná sɔhwɛ biara nni hɔ mma wɔn.
I couldn’t really hear them	Na mintumi nte wɔn ankasa
I hope that doesn’t sound terrible	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno nte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu
The excitement was overwhelming.	Ná anigye no yɛ kɛse.
The table shows the results.	Nsɛm a ɛwɔ pon no so no kyerɛ nea afi mu aba.
In that sense of the word.	Wɔ saa kwan no so.
I think my dad would really like you	Misusuw sɛ me papa ani begye wo ho ankasa
I just want to see them	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wɔn ara kwa
This is the critical time, at night.	Eyi ne bere a ɛho hia, anadwo.
We’ll be fine at home.	Yɛbɛyɛ yiye wɔ fie.
They will conclude that this is indeed possible.	Wɔde bɛba awiei sɛ eyi betumi ayɛ yiye ampa.
But it was a big mistake.	Nanso na ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
That was certainly something new, he told himself.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛno yɛ ade foforo.
Consider one of these.	Susuw biako ho hwɛ.
A very long time ago	Bere tenten paa a atwam ni
I just had money to spend	Ná mewɔ sika a mede bɛbɔ kɛkɛ
I hope you must enjoy this day	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye saa da yi ho
That is a terrible mistake.	Ɛno yɛ mfomso a ɛyɛ hu.
And it wasn’t what he wanted either.	Na ɛnyɛ nea na ɔpɛ nso.
I think we can deal with that	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi adi saa asɛm no ho dwuma
I didn't even care if it was true.	Sɛ ɛyɛ nokware a, na ɛnyɛ me asɛm mpo.
He is that man now.	Ɔno ne saa ɔbarima no mprempren.
Here are two more people.	Nnipa baanu foforo ni.
I don’t have such a plan	Minni nhyehyɛe a ɛte saa
Check out some of the photos below.	Hwɛ mfonini ahorow a ɛwɔ ase ha no bi.
It's been a long time.	Bere tenten bi ni.
And he didn’t want that.	Na na ɔmpɛ saa.
I could never feel at home, ever.	Na mintumi nte nka da sɛ mewɔ fie, da.
That wasn’t necessary.	Ná ɛno ho nhia.
While we are on the road.	Bere a yɛwɔ kwan so no.
Just like them.	Te sɛ wɔn ara pɛ.
He is a good guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa.
And that’s what it is.	Na ɛno ne.
I needed to hear about him	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mete ne ho asɛm
All of those things are there.	Saa nneɛma no nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
If anyone can help me.	Sɛ obi betumi aboa me a.
Too much information.	Nsɛm a wɔka kyerɛ dodo.
Look at this past weekend.	Hwɛ dapɛn awiei a atwam yi.
I went and asked someone why	Mekɔ bisaa obi nea enti a ɛte saa
And believe me.	Na gye me di.
A little dangerous, though.	Asiane wom kakra, nanso.
We put him on the bed.	Yɛde no too mpa no so.
I think most of us live well.	Misusuw sɛ yɛn mu dodow no ara tra ase yiye.
I didn’t know what to do or say	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ anaa mɛka
Many of them felt discouraged	Wɔn mu pii tee nka sɛ wɔn abam abu
I do have an idea about how time works	Mewɔ adwene bi wɔ sɛnea bere yɛ adwuma no ho ampa
We have his perfect way.	Yɛwɔ ne kwan a edi mũ.
If this were a game, two people could play.	Sɛ eyi yɛ agoru a, na nnipa baanu betumi adi agoru.
That kid wants it for nothing.	Saa abofra no pɛ kwa.
Otherwise, I can't do it any better	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, mintumi nyɛ no yiye biara
The people were way ahead of us.	Ná nkurɔfo no di yɛn anim koraa.
I needed to see them again	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu wɔn bio
I hope it is there for you	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ ma wo
That's beside the point though.	Ɛno wɔ asɛm no nkyɛn nanso.
I had the impression that it was	Ná mewɔ adwene sɛ ɛte saa
Things work the way they do.	Nneɛma yɛ adwuma sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma no.
But I could still hear him	Nanso na meda so ara te ne nsɛm
I got better at it later.	Meyɛɛ yiye wɔ mu akyiri yi.
I had to be really strong	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ me ho yɛ den ankasa
I think it might be something	Misusuw sɛ ebia ɛbɛyɛ biribi
Get involved a little bit.	Fa wo ho hyɛ mu kakra.
This is pretty amazing.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa yiye.
That will be the end of the story.	Ɛno na ɛbɛyɛ asɛm no awiei.
I feel it, he feels it too	Mete nka, ɔno nso te nka
I think the idea works	Misusuw sɛ adwene no yɛ adwuma
This project surprised me	Saa adwuma yi maa me ho dwiriw me
That was an amazing performance.	Ná ɛno yɛ agoru a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
As long as the money goes, everyone is with you.	Bere tenten a sika no kɔ so no, obiara ka wo ho.
It was absolutely terrifying.	Ná ɛyɛ hu koraa.
He didn’t like talking to me about work.	Ná n’ani nnye ho sɛ ɔne me bɛka adwuma ho asɛm.
As far as he knew.	Sɛnea na onim no.
People just didn’t see it.	Nkurɔfo anhu no ara kwa.
I will be happy to join you	Mede anigye bɛka wo ho
He watched the movie with me.	Ɔne me hwɛɛ sini no.
I told you it was hard, and it really is	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ ɛyɛ den, na ɛte saa ankasa
I knew exactly what to expect	Ná minim nea ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ kwan no yiye
We all live in the same house.	Yɛn nyinaa te ofie koro mu.
That’s a sin.	Ɛno yɛ bɔne.
I just love the story	Mepɛ asɛm no ara kwa
However, I was still alive	Nanso, na meda so ara te ase
There is no decision.	Gyinae biara nni hɔ.
And that was another thing.	Na ɛno yɛ ade foforo.
I have to tell you, feel it out	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo, te nka fi mu
I was excited to say the least	Ná m’ani agye sɛ mɛka no yiye
That’s how the afternoon ended, at least.	Saa na anyɛ yiye koraa no, awia no baa awiei.
He looked a little surprised.	Ɛte sɛ nea ne ho dwiriw no kakra.
I can’t imagine you	Mintumi nsusuw wo ho
I talk to him all the time	Me ne no kasa bere nyinaa
It all happened too fast for me	Ne nyinaa kɔɔ so ntɛmntɛm dodo maa me
Besides, it's too late.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, aka akyi dodo.
However, I can do this	Nanso, metumi ayɛ eyi
Nor is their music unremarkable	Saa ara nso na wɔn nnwom no nyɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa
That’s what’s still important to me.	Ɛno ne nea ɛda so ara yɛ nea ɛho hia me.
I should have taken a closer look	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ no yiye
Which might have been the case.	Nea ebia na ɛte saa.
I really enjoyed both of his rooms.	M’ani gyee ne dan abien no nyinaa ho ankasa.
I can't control who you've made arrangements with	Mintumi nni wɔn a wo ne wɔn ayɛ nhyehyɛe no so
The child.	Abofra no.
So much about power.	Enti nneɛma pii fa tumi ho.
No doubt he knew this.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na onim eyi.
I just knew his name	Ná minim ne din ara kwa
Part of that is not his fault.	Ɛno fã bi nyɛ ne mfomso.
The new system.	Nhyehyɛe foforo no.
And, we do that.	Na, yɛyɛ saa.
But this is not about me.	Nanso eyi nyɛ me ho asɛm.
At the time it didn’t hurt that much	Saa bere no na ɛnyɛ me yaw saa
I have done my, homework, as you say	Mayɛ me, fie nnwuma, sɛnea woka no
What is it that is.	Dɛn ne no.
I understand that now	Mete saa asɛm no ase mprempren
And still not so great.	Na ɛda so ara yɛ nea ɛnyɛ kɛse saa.
His pain hurts me.	Ne yaw no yɛ me yaw.
I thought the whole thing would come to me.	Misusuwii sɛ asɛm no nyinaa bɛba me nkyɛn.
That was a lot of money.	Ná ɛno yɛ sika kɛse.
It was his favorite.	Ná ɛyɛ nea n’ani gye ho paa.
I understand your problem.	Mete wo haw no ase.
There would be more attention and more people.	Anka wɔde wɔn adwene besi so kɛse na nnipa pii nso bɛba hɔ.
And we have the.	Na yɛwɔ.
It’s a terrible situation.	Ɛyɛ tebea a ɛyɛ hu.
He wrapped his arms around her.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ ne ho.
I think we have a problem	Misusuw sɛ yɛwɔ ɔhaw bi
And that’s not the end of the story.	Na ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no awiei.
I can’t have you in my house anymore	Mintumi nnya wo wɔ me fie bio
That someone will come.	Sɛ obi bɛba.
A month ago, this would have seemed impossible.	Ɔsram biako a atwam ni no, anka ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
This is what happened in our case.	Eyi ne nea esii wɔ yɛn asɛm no mu.
Every day has been a great day.	Da biara ayɛ da kɛse.
He was there.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ.
I forget their names	Me werɛ fi wɔn din
I have to think things through	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw nneɛma ho yiye
I also enjoy it with pleasure	M’ani gye ho nso wɔ anigye mu
You go out with the old.	Wo ne dedaw no fi adi.
It’s a lot of it.	Ɛyɛ pii.
Children are not with them.	Mma nka wɔn ho.
They are a wonderful group.	Wɔyɛ kuw bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He really was one of my favorite people.	Ná ɔyɛ nnipa a m’ani gye wɔn ho paa no mu biako ankasa.
I could have provided resources	Anka metumi de nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma ama
I have a lot to say.	Mewɔ nsɛm pii a mɛka.
I find it very important	Mihu sɛ ɛho hia kɛse
They are my friends.	Wɔyɛ me nnamfo.
I need to do that right now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa mprempren ara.
But on another project.	Nanso wɔ adwuma foforo so.
It’s one of my favorites.	Ɛyɛ nea m’ani gye ho paa no mu biako.
Mine was quite soft and juicy.	Ná me de no yɛ mmerɛw koraa na ɛyɛ nsu.
This is beautiful.	Eyi yɛ fɛ.
A man's hand.	Ɔbarima bi nsa.
There was one car.	Ná kar biako wɔ hɔ.
But he's good if you're in trouble.	Nanso ɔyɛ papa sɛ wowɔ ɔhaw bi mu.
At least it was mine.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛyɛ me de.
They must be used.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde di dwuma.
Most were of the girl, beautiful, and happy.	Ná dodow no ara yɛ abeawa no de, na wɔn ho yɛ fɛ, na wɔn ani agye.
I can't see anything else	Mintumi nhu biribi foforo biara
His idea was interesting.	Ná n’adwene no yɛ anigye.
And the point is this weekend.	Na asɛm no ne dapɛn awiei yi.
However, I knew it was	Nanso, na minim sɛ ɛte saa
I enjoyed it in the same way as I do today.	M’ani gyee ho wɔ ɔkwan koro no ara so sɛnea ɛte nnɛ no.
I have to apologize.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mepa kyɛw.
Just a few years.	Mfe kakraa bi pɛ.
I think you have a right to know	Misusuw sɛ wowɔ hokwan sɛ wuhu
I couldn’t imagine anyone actually living in it	Na mintumi nsusuw ho sɛ obi te mu ankasa
I pretended to be ignorant	Meyɛɛ me ho sɛ minnim hwee
These endings are happy.	Saa awiei ahorow yi yɛ anigye.
I enjoy being alone from time to time	M’ani gye sɛ me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ bere ne bere mu
I didn't care who was with us	Ná onii a ɔka yɛn ho no mfa me ho
I just didn’t like the look of it.	Nea ɛyɛ ara ne sɛ na m’ani nnye sɛnea ɛte no ho.
It’s just a matter of time and what kind of work.	Ɛyɛ bere ne adwuma bɛn ho asɛm ara kwa.
This is not about my preference.	Eyi nyɛ asɛm a mepɛ ho asɛm.
That was some of the money we bought the house.	Ɛno ne sika a yɛde tɔɔ dan no bi.
It had been a long day.	Ná ayɛ da tenten bi.
That’s my day.	Ɛno ne me da.
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.	Sɛ ɛte sɛ nea eye dodo sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nokware a, ebia ɛte saa.
And you’d be right, in general terms.	Na wobɛka no yiye, wɔ nsɛm a wɔka no nyinaa mu.
I can’t give you time or my attention	Mintumi mma wo bere anaa m’adwene
And it didn’t work.	Na anyɛ yiye.
I knew he was too fast	Ná minim sɛ ɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo
The house and the head are one	Ofie ne ti no yɛ biako
I wish it were, but it isn’t	Me yam a anka ɛte saa, nanso ɛnte saa
He seemed too perfect.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ pɛ dodo.
Do whatever you want.	Yɛ nea wopɛ biara.
Maybe not necessary, but still great.	Ebia ɛho nhia, nanso ɛda so ara yɛ kɛse.
But his mother was not to be put aside so soon.	Nanso na ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔde ne maame to nkyɛn ntɛm saa.
Other than my bedroom, it’s my favorite room.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ me mpa a, ɛyɛ dan a m’ani gye ho paa.
You can’t keep up with him.	Worentumi nkɔ so ne no nkɔ.
You can find the full text of the book here.	Wubetumi ahu nhoma no mu nsɛm nyinaa wɔ ha.
I'm really looking at you	Mehwɛ wo ankasa
I’m glad you like me.	M’ani agye sɛ w’ani gye me ho.
And they, apparently.	Na wɔn nso, ɛda adi sɛ.
At the same time, different industries have different features.	Bere koro no ara mu no, nnwuma ahorow wɔ nneɛma ahorow.
Good song, that.	Dwom pa, ɛno.
But the situation itself was false.	Nanso na tebea no ankasa yɛ atoro.
These results tell us that it is happening.	Nea afi mu aba yi kyerɛ yɛn sɛ ɛrekɔ so.
So it is not human.	Enti ɛnyɛ onipa de.
Lots of fun, but in the end, it’s more of the same.	Anigye pii, nanso awiei koraa no, ɛyɛ ade koro no ara kɛse.
I have been wanting to make one for a while now.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biako bere tiaa bi ni.
I love this time of the morning.	M’ani gye anɔpa bere yi ho.
My feet are never too far off the ground.	Me nan nkɔ akyiri dodo mfi fam da.
I felt the same way	Ná me nso mete nka saa
He is his son like mine too.	Ɔyɛ ne ba te sɛ me de no nso.
I didn't want to talk about the truth.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meka nokware no ho asɛm.
But where people are.	Nanso baabi a nnipa wɔ.
And that’s very true.	Na ɛno yɛ nokware paa.
I still want to be with you	Meda so ara pɛ sɛ me ne mo tra
I think you should know that	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu saa
I hope this is the last time this year	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ eyi ne bere a etwa to afe yi
Even life animals.	Nkwa mmoa mpo.
I know it was bad, though	Minim sɛ na ɛyɛ bɔne, nanso
But that’s not the point.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
I slipped through one, again	Mede me ho faa biako mu, bio
That way, people knew where to take me.	Saa kwan no so no, na nkurɔfo nim baabi a wɔde me bɛkɔ.
They both work just fine.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye ara kwa.
I have to do something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi.
But there was something else.	Nanso na biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
I should have watched you better	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ wo yiye
Think about the issue.	Susuw asɛm no ho hwɛ.
That it is all true.	Sɛ ne nyinaa yɛ nokware.
He is more like you in this way.	Ɔte sɛ wo kɛse wɔ saa kwan yi so.
The phone would ring.	Ná telefon no bɛbɔ.
It looked pretty good, otherwise.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye, anyɛ saa a.
This is what you want.	Eyi ne nea wopɛ.
I just say things like that	Meka nsɛm a ɛte saa ara kwa
Neither day, really.	Nna abien no mu biara nyɛ saa, ankasa.
That much was true.	Ná saa dodow no ara yɛ nokware.
That's over with.	Ɛno aba awiei ne.
It has a wide variety of features.	Ɛwɔ nneɛma ahorow pii.
I want you to touch me.	Mepɛ sɛ wode wo nsa ka me.
It’s the best right now.	Ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara mprempren.
We both go happy.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa de anigye kɔ.
There must be another way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan foforo wɔ hɔ.
But nothing is that simple.	Nanso biribiara nyɛ mmerɛw saa.
At least we had that going for us.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na yɛwɔ saa kɔ ma yɛn.
Part of me still couldn’t believe it	Ná me fã bi da so ara ntumi nnye nni
Most people are good.	Nnipa dodow no ara yɛ papa.
I had no idea at the time.	Ná minni adwene biara saa bere no.
He signed it off.	Ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ ase.
I can’t do a job.	Mintumi nyɛ adwuma bi.
I'm not doing well at all.	Menyɛ yiye koraa.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I told him again.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​bio.
I was well aware of that	Ná minim saa asɛm no yiye
Let the group introduce themselves.	Ma kuw no nkyerɛ wɔn ho.
My feet wore whatever worked best.	Ná me nan hyɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma yiye biara.
I didn't want him to touch her	Ná mempɛ sɛ ɔde ne nsa bɛka no
And travel a lot.	Na tu kwan pii.
After that, there is nothing.	Ɛno akyi no, biribiara nni hɔ.
I can’t believe it’s in my house	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɛwɔ me fie
I must be a species lover	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ obi a mepɛ mmoa ahorow
Provide information.	Fa nsɛm ma.
I was too young at the time	Saa bere no na meyɛ abofra dodo
I didn’t even know him	Ná minnim no mpo
I have the gun, remember	Mewɔ tuo no, kae
I see that very well.	Mihu saa asɛm no yiye.
I wasn’t happy at work	Ná m’ani nnye adwumam
We leaned against the window.	Yɛde yɛn ho bɔɔ mfɛnsere no mu.
I didn’t want to say anything.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meka hwee.
That was a mistake.	Ná saa asɛm no yɛ mfomso.
I can't really argue with that	Mintumi ne saa asɛm no nnye akyinnye ankasa
You don’t want to know that.	Wompɛ sɛ wuhu saa asɛm no.
I think it must be good	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ papa
A few days later, the same thing happened	Nna kakraa bi akyi no, ade koro no ara sii
Enough in this case.	Ɛdɔɔso wɔ asɛm yi mu.
I know what that looks like	Minim sɛnea ɛno te
I had missed them both so much.	Ná me werɛ fii wɔn baanu no yiye.
And that seems to be the point.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ne asɛm no.
A year is a very long time	Afe yɛ bere tenten paa
Thank you for that too	Meda wo ase wɔ ɛno nso ho
This may include a very difficult one.	Ebia eyi betumi aka bi a ɛyɛ den yiye ho.
It’s the money that seems odd.	Ɛyɛ sika a ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa no.
Two things really.	Nneɛma abien ankasa.
I understand this is a little weird	Mete ase sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa kakra
That was not part of the curriculum at all.	Ná ɛno nyɛ adesua nhyehyɛe no fã koraa.
But the last point certainly got his attention.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ asɛm a etwa to no nyaa n’adwene.
I didn't want to touch that hand	Ná mempɛ sɛ mede me nsa bɛka saa nsa no
I have a job to do.	Mewɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
No wonder he looks older.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ ɔte sɛ nea ne mfe akɔ anim.
It never needed another name.	Ná enhia din foforo biara da.
You are in a good position.	Wowɔ tebea pa mu.
I do use the products and like them a lot	Mede nneɛma no di dwuma ampa na m’ani gye ho kɛse
After all, I wasn’t alone	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na ɛnyɛ me nkutoo
But not just yet.	Nanso ɛnyɛ de besi nnɛ kɛkɛ.
I made them alone	Me nkutoo na meyɛɛ wɔn
This is not for human use.	Eyi nyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ nnipa de di dwuma.
Maybe there was an opportunity.	Ebia na hokwan bi wɔ hɔ.
I'm doing a job.	Meyɛ adwuma bi.
I wish you didn't have to be upset	Me yam a anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ wo yaw
I was not one of them	Ná menyɛ wɔn mu biako
I think that’s why he seems so strange	Misusuw sɛ ɛno nti na ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ nwonwa saa no
No one planned it, and no one wanted it.	Obiara anyɛ ho nhyehyɛe, na obiara mpɛ.
A few of them even have something in it	Wɔn mu kakraa bi mpo wɔ biribi wɔ mu
You can move on to another subject.	Wubetumi akɔ asɛm foforo so.
I can always add to it later	Metumi de aka ho bere nyinaa akyiri yi
This had to be him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ ɔno.
I know the way things work.	Minim ɔkwan a nneɛma fa so yɛ adwuma.
It doesn’t sound terribly exciting.	Ɛnte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye a ɛyɛ hu.
On the ground in the park.	Wɔ fam wɔ abɔnten so.
I can’t see it now.	Mintumi nhu no mprempren.
I point to the door	Mede me nsa kyerɛ ɔpon no ano
It doesn’t even do that.	Ɛnyɛ saa mpo.
I know what they say about this.	Minim nea wɔka fa eyi ho.
Or, at least, not the whole story.	Anaasɛ, anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
That is not a good time.	Ɛno nyɛ bere pa.
I was excited to finally be working with children	Ná m’ani agye sɛ awiei koraa no me ne mmofra reyɛ adwuma
Every group had done them.	Na kuw biara ayɛ wɔn.
I like cheap stuff.	M’ani gye nneɛma a ne bo yɛ mmerɛw ho.
I have to tell him to do it	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no sɛ ɔnyɛ
To say what he has to say	Sɛ ɔbɛka nea ɔwɔ ka
I'm sorry, it's my fault	Mepa wo kyɛw, ɛyɛ me mfomso
You are with him.	Wo ne no wɔ hɔ.
It’s just as simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa ara.
There was never an easy way out.	Ná ɔkwan a ɛyɛ mmerɛw biara nni hɔ da.
No one is outside now.	Obiara nni abɔnten mprempren.
Nothing else seemed more important.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛho hia sen saa.
I wasn’t scared at all	Ná ɛnyɛ me hu koraa
I think you have a good idea	Misusuw sɛ wowɔ adwene pa bi
He had to make a plan.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
Now half goes one way and half goes the other.	Mprempren fã kɔ ɔkwan biako so na fã kɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
I don’t want to hear the details.	Mempɛ sɛ mete nsɛm no mu nsɛm.
I still couldn’t really sleep	Ná meda so ara ntumi nna ankasa
But we have to do it.	Nanso yɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
He tells me everything.	Ɔno na ɔka biribiara kyerɛ me.
He would do anything for her.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ biribiara ama no.
Half a year had passed.	Ná afe fã atwam.
I had to do that	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa
She was just a girl then.	Ná ɔyɛ abeawa ara kwa saa bere no.
It’s a bad time.	Ɛyɛ bere bɔne.
I am new to them all	Meyɛ foforo ma wɔn nyinaa
But maybe it didn’t matter.	Nanso ebia na ɛnyɛ hwee.
We can go now.	Yebetumi akɔ mprempren.
You have to practice what you want to do.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ no di dwuma.
I did this every weekend	Ná meyɛ eyi dapɛn awiei biara
I can’t feel anything	Mintumi nte biribiara nka
With the help of the.	Ne mmoa no.
He was alive at the time.	Ná ɔte ase saa bere no.
I couldn’t say the same about myself	Na mintumi nka saa ara mfa me ho
That was a short time.	Ná ɛno yɛ bere tiaa bi.
I have to do something	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi
That’s the point.	Ɛno ne asɛm no.
I’m really quite impressed.	M’ani gye ho yiye ampa.
I couldn't sleep with him here	Na mintumi nna ɔkwan biara so ne no wɔ ha
I think every man has his price	Misusuw sɛ ɔbarima biara wɔ ne bo
I can’t really hear it	Mintumi nte ankasa
Perhaps the result was the best after all.	Ebia na nea afi mu aba ne nea eye sen biara wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
I have to think about time	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw bere ho
There was no alternative.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ saa.
It wasn't cold in the car now.	Ná ɛnyɛ awɔw wɔ kar no mu mprempren.
It’s your plan.	Ɛyɛ wo nhyehyɛe no.
I want it right here right now	Mepɛ no wɔ ha yi ara seesei ara
His father took it hard.	Ne papa faa no denneennen.
I hope you can enjoy it	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi anya mu anigye
Get out more often.	Fi adi mpɛn pii.
Those things are not dangerous to us.	Saa nneɛma no nyɛ asiane mma yɛn.
Tell me it’s my fault.	Ka kyerɛ me sɛ ɛyɛ me mfomso.
I glanced at the table	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ pon no so
Your comments show.	Wo nsɛm a woka no kyerɛ.
I use that all the time	Mede saa di dwuma bere nyinaa
Or you take longer.	Anaasɛ wugye bere tenten.
I couldn’t understand it	Ná mintumi nte ase
I think that’s what’s happening	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne nea ɛrekɔ so
I didn't have his picture	Ná minni ne mfonini no
I admired his intelligence	M’ani gyee ne nyansa ho
None of these people think they have a problem.	Saa nnipa yi mu biara nsusuw sɛ ɔwɔ ɔhaw bi.
This was no easy task	Ná eyi nyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw
I know he will do that	Minim sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa
The paleness of a man's face	Ɔbarima bi anim a ɛyɛ mmerɛw
I thought he had you	Misusuwii sɛ ɔwɔ wo
I wonder what you said in that room	Misusuw nea wokae wɔ saa dan no mu no ho
Looks like a good morning here.	Ɛte sɛ nea anɔpa pa wɔ ha.
I knew you wouldn’t make it	Ná minim sɛ worentumi nyɛ yiye
He was a human being. 	Ná ɔyɛ onipa. 
I saw what it was like.	Mihuu sɛnea na ɛte.
I’m really excited to work with him.	M’ani agye ankasa sɛ me ne no yɛ adwuma.
However, I wanted him to	Nanso, na mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa
I will never forget that	Me werɛ ntumi mfi saa asɛm no da
I think we do that.	Misusuw sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
I just couldn’t allow that	Na mintumi mma saa kwan kɛkɛ
There is every such story.	Asɛm biara wɔ hɔ a ɛte saa.
There are several problems with this.	Ɔhaw ahorow pii wɔ eyi ho.
However, there are two problems with that.	Nanso, ɔhaw abien na ɛwɔ saa asɛm no mu.
That works for me.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma ma me.
You just don’t care anymore.	Wo deɛ ɛnyɛ wo asɛm bio kɛkɛ.
Return an error.	Fa mfomso san ba.
And the car, too.	Na kar no nso.
The work of my hands.	Me nsa ano adwuma.
And it’s inside it.	Na ɛwɔ mu no.
There is no money.	Sika biara nni hɔ.
However, not everything is like that.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ biribiara na ɛte saa.
I was far too excited	Ná m’ani agye dodo koraa
You don’t really need to know.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wuhu ankasa.
I was the next person	Ná meyɛ onipa a odi hɔ
It had the best potential.	Ná ɛwɔ tumi a eye sen biara.
He looked down at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ fam.
I told him that he owed me	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɔde me ka
He hears about it from me.	Ɔte ho asɛm fi me hɔ.
That is not really true.	Ɛno nyɛ nokware ankasa.
I had to take a closer look	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu yiye
But one must believe something.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ onipa gye biribi di.
I didn’t want to do that	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa
However, this does not mean that humans are the only ones who do so.	Nanso, eyi mma ɛnyɛ nnipa nkutoo na wɔyɛ saa.
He knew her completely.	Ná onim no koraa.
He was in such good shape, so strong.	Ná ɔwɔ tebea pa mu saa, na na ɔyɛ den saa.
It’s a little harder this time around	Ɛyɛ den kakra saa bere yi
He wanted everyone to know.	Na ɔpɛ sɛ obiara hu.
I can easily do it	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ metumi ayɛ
It’s a temporary look.	Ɛyɛ bere tiaa mu hwɛ.
But this.	Nanso eyi.
I just got off the phone with him	Me ne no fii telefon no so ara pɛ
I signed one and my father signed another	Mede me nsa hyɛɛ biako ase na me papa de me nsa hyɛɛ foforo ase
It wasn’t really mine.	Na ɛnyɛ me de ankasa.
I need to get to know him better	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no yiye
I think they were the only ones involved	Misusuw sɛ na wɔn nkutoo na wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ mu
Many of them.	Wɔn mu pii.
Not everyone can take the test.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na obetumi ayɛ sɔhwɛ no.
I like a lot of different things.	M’ani gye nneɛma ahorow pii ho.
I think he did it on purpose too	Misusuw sɛ ɔno nso hyɛɛ da yɛɛ saa
I keep up with them.	Me ne wɔn kɔ so yɛ ade.
I was one of them and my opinion of myself	Na meyɛ wɔn mu biako ne m’adwene wɔ me ho
I think this will work	Misusuw sɛ eyi bɛyɛ adwuma
It does not work on products.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma wɔ nneɛma a wɔyɛ so.
Your support has been great.	Mo mmoa no ayɛ kɛse.
I know how much time you have	Minim bere dodow a wowɔ
His help was vital in another way.	Ná ne mmoa no ho hia kɛse wɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
But no one talks about this.	Nanso obiara nka eyi ho asɛm.
He had worked for her for a while.	Ná wayɛ adwuma ama no bere tiaa bi.
And he knew he wanted to be good.	Na na onim sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ papa.
I had to keep running	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so tu mmirika
I want to say thank you very much.	Mepɛ sɛ meka sɛ meda mo ase pii.
It is our most important privilege.	Ɛyɛ yɛn hokwan a ɛho hia sen biara.
We can say that.	Yebetumi aka saa.
You know the man is a bad man.	Wunim sɛ ɔbarima no yɛ ɔbarima bɔne.
It’s absolutely amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa.
It’s hard to.	Ɛyɛ den.
Different people told me different things.	Nnipa ahorow kaa nsɛm ahorow kyerɛɛ me.
There will be an opportunity.	Hokwan bi bɛba.
I think that would be good	Misusuw sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ papa
The paper will be used.	Krataa no bɛyɛ nea wɔde di dwuma.
I can’t imagine doing anything else	Mintumi nsusuw ho sɛ mɛyɛ biribi foforo biara
I was really excited	Ná m’ani agye ankasa
He does hot stuff.	Ɔyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ hyew.
You have a good prospect.	Wowɔ anidaso pa.
He was amazing.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa.
I knew it had to be something he thought of	Ná minim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ biribi a osusuw ho
I do things the right way	Meyɛ nneɛma ɔkwan pa so
I had completely forgotten about it	Ná me werɛ afi ho koraa
So for me, it was amazing.	Enti wɔ me fam no, na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Think about it.	Susuw ho hwɛ.
Besides, there is nothing you can do at home.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ wɔ fie.
I just want you to know it was an accident	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu ara ne sɛ na ɛyɛ akwanhyia
I am the only one there.	Me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ.
But our work was in progress	Nanso na yɛn adwuma no yɛ nea ɛrekɔ so
I have one right here	Mewɔ bi wɔ ha yi ara
The truth is not their interest.	Nokware no nyɛ wɔn anigye.
Hopefully it will be beautiful.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I knew him like a book.	Ná minim no te sɛ nhoma.
I think we were all surprised	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ yɛn nyinaa nwonwa
Even the child had one.	Ná abofra no mpo wɔ bi.
I know what you are not	Minim nea wonyɛ
No group photos.	Kuw mfonini biara nni hɔ.
The man knows the boy is your son.	Ɔbarima no nim sɛ abarimaa no yɛ wo ba.
I hope you know the same	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo nso wunim saa ara
He likes this other side of the story.	N’ani gye asɛm no fã foforo yi ho.
He really liked her.	N’ani gyee ne ho ampa.
I was the most popular girl in school	Ná meyɛ abeawa a nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho sen biara wɔ sukuu mu
Hopefully we won’t be able to do that.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
I could never tell anyone about him	Na mintumi nka ne ho asɛm nkyerɛ obiara da
I'm too hot.	Me ho ayɛ hyew dodo.
However, I couldn’t do that.	Nanso, na mintumi nyɛ saa.
He gave her everything he had.	Ɔde nea ɔwɔ nyinaa maa no.
I am my mother’s son.	Meyɛ me maame ba.
I could actually taste it	Ná metumi aka ahwɛ ankasa
So has everyone else.	Saa ara na obiara a aka no nso ayɛ.
Our bad habits continued that day.	Yɛn su bɔne no kɔɔ so saa da no.
This method may work well in most situations.	Ebia saa kwan yi bɛyɛ adwuma yiye wɔ tebea dodow no ara mu.
He had no idea what to say.	Ná onni nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka ho adwene biara.
I was sitting by the window	Ná mete mfɛnsere no ho
This went well.	Eyi kɔɔ so yiye.
They spent a lot of time together.	Wɔde bere pii bɔɔ mu.
Something like happiness.	Biribi te sɛ anigye.
I didn’t like this room	Ná m’ani nnye dan yi ho
And it’s just this.	Na ɛyɛ eyi ara kwa.
They should be sent to jail.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn kɔ afiase.
Himself or me.	Ɔno ankasa anaa me.
When we had a big game, he was there.	Sɛ yɛwɔ agoru kɛse bi a, na ɔwɔ hɔ.
Mom wants you.	Maame pɛ wo.
Just look at what he likes to do in bed.	Hwɛ nea n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ wɔ mpa so kɛkɛ.
He knew it.	Ná onim.
However, I wish him well.	Nanso, mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ yiye.
Very handsome with lots of money	Nea ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye a ɔwɔ sika pii
So, turn around.	Enti, dan wo ho.
I know a lot from you	Minim pii fi wo hɔ
He was my father.	Ná ɔyɛ me papa.
That was part of it.	Ná ɛno yɛ ne fã.
I don’t know why he told you that.	Minnim nea enti a ɔka kyerɛɛ wo saa.
I thought he wanted better	Misusuwii sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ eye sen saa
I had no idea you were here	Ná minni adwene biara sɛ wowɔ ha
But it is over now.	Nanso aba awiei mprempren.
I could almost enjoy this	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na metumi anya eyi ho anigye
It feels amazing today.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa nnɛ.
I think it will be very popular.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nea nkurɔfo ani gye ho kɛse.
There’s probably a good chance it does.	Ebia hokwan pa wɔ hɔ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
One does not see why it should not have been.	Obi nhu nea enti a anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I was hoping to do the latter	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ mɛyɛ nea etwa to no
I couldn’t take my eyes off either	Ná mintumi mfa m’ani mfi m’ani so nso
Not even one thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade biako mpo.
I heard what you said	Metee nea wokae no
How long had it been.	Bere tenten ahe na na atwam.
There was a table inside.	Ná pon bi wɔ mu.
I can’t get away from him	Mintumi mfi ne ho
We have	Yɛwɔ .
People said they were perfect.	Nkurɔfo kae sɛ wɔyɛ pɛ.
I’m excited to share her thoughts with you here	M’ani agye sɛ mɛka n’adwene akyerɛ mo wɔ ha
It was just one day.	Ná ɛyɛ da koro pɛ.
Each knew this was dangerous work.	Ná wɔn mu biara nim sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma a asiane wom.
Or any man, really.	Anaasɛ ɔbarima biara, ampa.
I didn’t want to hear them	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete wɔn
These factors often make learning more difficult.	Saa nneɛma yi taa ma adesua yɛ den kɛse.
I think it was a bit of both	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ abien no nyinaa kakra
I knew this in the back of my mind somewhere	Ná minim eyi wɔ m’adwene akyi wɔ baabi
Not at any price.	Ɛnyɛ bo biara so.
I will introduce the first course.	Mede adesua a edi kan no bɛba.
I have re-established it.	Mede asi hɔ bio.
I went to school with your mother	Me ne wo maame kɔɔ sukuu
There seemed to be nothing else to do.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Please tell me what you think.	Mesrɛ wo ka nea wususuw ho kyerɛ me.
There is much to admire about this book.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn ani gye ho wɔ nhoma yi ho.
That doesn’t seem to be the case here.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnte saa wɔ ha.
I always wanted him	Ná mepɛ no bere nyinaa
He was a part of me.	Na ɔyɛ me fã bi.
Go on your way.	Kɔ wo kwan so.
I could say that, but it would be a lie	Metumi aka saa, nanso ɛbɛyɛ atoro
I need to look into this	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ eyi mu
There is power in your self-image.	Tumi wɔ wo ho mfonini mu.
I hope to use it one day.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mede bedi dwuma da bi.
The same was true of his.	Saa ara na na ne de nso te.
I have done what you want.	Mayɛ nea wopɛ.
Never as an equal.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ obi a ɔne no yɛ pɛ da.
That’s not much.	Ɛno nyɛ pii.
It was a terrible time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ hu.
Happiness can mean anything beautiful.	Anigye betumi akyerɛ biribiara a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I cannot for the life of me know why.	Mintumi mma me nkwa nhu nea enti a ɛte saa.
You do, and he knows where we are.	Woyɛ saa, na onim baabi a yɛwɔ.
I just have to believe it	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye di ara kwa
Maybe he was there.	Ebia na ɔwɔ hɔ.
I saw him in front of them.	Mihuu no wɔ wɔn anim.
But nothing seemed to be a problem.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea biribiara nyɛ ɔhaw.
I look out into the night	Mehwɛ abɔnten kosi anadwo
I’m really excited.	M’ani agye ankasa.
Not on me this time.	Ɛnyɛ me so saa bere yi.
Don't go in yet.	Mma nkɔ mu de besi nnɛ.
I still have that problem	Meda so ara wɔ saa ɔhaw no
I never wanted anything bad to happen to him	Ná mempɛ sɛ biribi bɔne bi to no da
I couldn’t help it, really	Na mintumi nyɛ hwee, ampa
But it doesn’t really work.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma ankasa.
Save your language, as you see it.	Gye wo kasa, sɛnea wuhu no.
I had to take the day off from school	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ migye da no fi sukuu mu
Tell me about it.	Ka ho asɛm kyerɛ me.
At least if you are us, what we are.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, sɛ woyɛ yɛn a, nea yɛyɛ.
One of the most amazing songs	Nnwom a ɛyɛ nwonwa sen biara no mu biako
I finally felt better	Awiei koraa no, me ho tɔɔ me
The plan worked.	Nhyehyɛe no yɛɛ adwuma.
That could have been us.	Anka ɛno betumi ayɛ yɛn.
Anything else you do.	Biribiara foforo a wobɛyɛ.
I couldn’t get through it	Na mintumi mfa mu
That’s the good one.	Ɛno ne nea eye no.
There is a mistake.	Mfomso wɔ hɔ.
I can only hope you do too	Metumi anya anidaso sɛ wo nso wobɛyɛ saa
He seems to want that.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔpɛ saa.
I wish nothing good comes your way.	Me yam a anka papa biara mma wo kwan so.
His situation would be difficult.	Ná ne tebea no bɛyɛ den.
I don’t want to talk about that yet.	Mempɛ sɛ meka saa asɛm no ho asɛm de besi nnɛ.
I have no idea how he does it	Minnim sɛnea ɔyɛ no ho adwene biara
That’s my problem, not yours.	Ɛno ne me haw, ɛnyɛ wo de.
I didn’t like the atmosphere	Ná m’ani nnye tebea a na ɛwɔ hɔ no ho
It’s not a table.	Ɛnyɛ pon bi.
Both are true.	Nneɛma abien no nyinaa yɛ nokware.
I just want this to end	Mepɛ sɛ eyi ba awiei ara kwa
In my opinion, that is the situation here.	Wɔ m’adwene mu no, ɛno ne tebea a ɛwɔ ha.
However, I immediately fell in love with him	Nanso, m’ani gyee ne ho ntɛm ara
I’m very happy with both of them	M’ani agye yiye wɔ wɔn baanu nyinaa ho
I did know what it was like	Ná minim sɛnea ɛte ampa
I felt his age, his wisdom.	Metee ne mfe, ne nyansa nka.
I know how to do it.	Minim sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
I think too much about music	Misusuw nnwom ho dodo
I was there with my son.	Ná me ne me ba no wɔ hɔ.
These names are good names.	Saa din ahorow yi yɛ din pa.
I’m very excited about it	M’ani gye ho yiye
This is not what this is about.	Ɛnyɛ eyi ne nea eyi fa ho.
Everyone wants one.	Obiara pɛ bi.
Many of you don’t really like it.	Mo mu pii ani nnye ho ankasa.
I had a really good time overall	Me nyaa bere pa ankasa wɔ ne nyinaa mu
A car does not provide any food.	Kar mfa aduan biara mma.
There was no car.	Ná kar biara nni hɔ.
I know this is hard for you too	Minim sɛ eyi yɛ den ma wo nso
As far as I know, this should work.	Sɛnea minim no, ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma.
I have to be honest	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka nokware
I was a little shocked, that’s all	Me ho dwiriw me kakra, ɛno ara ne no
I want to feel you inside me	Mepɛ sɛ mete wo nka wɔ me mu
More life, more language.	Nkwa pii, kasa mu nsɛm pii.
And there were many of them.	Na wɔn mu pii nso wɔ hɔ.
He lives here.	Ɔte ha.
I think there is a good idea	Misusuw sɛ adwene pa bi wɔ hɔ
There were no other cars on the road.	Ná kar foforo biara nni kwan no so.
I can give you anything you want	Metumi ama wo biribiara a wopɛ
But it’s not just those things.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa nneɛma no nkutoo.
His father is a.	Ne papa yɛ a.
Don’t think it was easy.	Nsusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
It's a little too late, though	Nanso, aka akyi dodo kakra
I haven’t been that excited in a long time.	M’ani nnye ho saa bere tenten ni.
They all raise their hands.	Wɔn nyinaa ma wɔn nsa so.
I know where you mean	Minim baabi a wopɛ sɛ woka
I’m happy and I’m not happy	M’ani gye na m’ani nnye ho
It’s a part of it.	Ɛyɛ ne fã bi.
And it was hot.	Na na ɛyɛ hyew.
He will help them.	Ɔbɛboa wɔn.
Everything you want to do, you can pretty much see it.	Biribiara a wopɛ sɛ woyɛ no, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ wubetumi ahu.
That was the plan.	Ná ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no.
You have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
I believe you are honest.	Migye di sɛ woyɛ obi a odi nokware.
I didn't want to see that face	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu saa anim a ɛyɛ fɛ no
He doesn’t do the job.	Ɔnyɛ adwuma no.
He slammed his hands on them.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ wɔn so.
I knew that two of our cars were still involved	Ná minim sɛ yɛn kar abien da so ara ka ho
After that, I knew nothing	Ɛno akyi no, na minnim hwee
It was just too expensive.	Ná ne bo yɛ den dodo ara kwa.
They are given away.	Wɔde wɔn ma.
I would have thought he would	Anka misusuw sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa
But a few did.	Nanso kakraa bi yɛɛ saa.
It would have been too easy.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
It will be terrible.	Ɛbɛyɛ hu.
The key is to tell the whole story.	Nea ɛho hia ne sɛ wobɛka asɛm no nyinaa.
Be honest with yourself.	Di nokware ma wo ho.
None of that happened.	Saa nneɛma no mu biara amma.
One of the best of them.	Wɔn a eye sen biara no mu biako.
I was still wearing clothes.	Ná meda so ara hyɛ ntade.
Everyone obviously has something to say.	Ɛda adi sɛ obiara wɔ biribi ka.
But those two didn’t know that.	Nanso na saa baanu no nnim saa.
Maybe I just wasn’t there	Ebia na minni hɔ saa ara
But in this group it’s amazing.	Nanso wɔ saa kuw yi mu no ɛyɛ nwonwa.
It’s not really that.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛte saa ankasa.
I didn’t know what it was	Ná minnim nea ɛyɛ
I was shocked to see how much money he had	Me ho dwiriw me sɛ mihu sika dodow a ɔwɔ
But it’s a wonderful story nonetheless.	Nanso ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa ne nyinaa mu.
Like a squirrel.	Te sɛ ɔkraman.
It looks pretty cool.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Here are a few.	Kakraa bi ni.
This was their job.	Ná eyi ne wɔn adwuma.
Around this date or a little later.	Bɛyɛ saa da yi anaasɛ ɛno akyi kakra.
I am hard on myself.	Meyɛ den wɔ me ho.
I feel like we are almost one	Mete nka sɛ ɛkame ayɛ sɛ yɛyɛ biako
There will be a lot going on that evening.	Pii bɛkɔ so saa anwummere no.
I want to hear you speak	Mepɛ sɛ mete wo kasa
But he didn’t have one.	Nanso na onni bi.
I have to tell him the truth	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka nokware no kyerɛ no
Our first experiments.	Yɛn sɔhwɛ ahorow a edi kan no.
I can give you some	Metumi de bi ama
A lot of these new things bother me	Saa nneɛma foforo yi pii haw me
Work as little as possible.	Yɛ adwuma kakraa bi sɛnea wubetumi.
It was just a good game	Ná ɛyɛ agoru pa ara kwa
Good night to both of you.	Anadwo pa ma mo baanu nyinaa.
The same is true.	Saa ara na ɛte.
But he knew her.	Nanso na onim no.
They are very dangerous.	Wɔyɛ hu yiye.
But someone did.	Nanso obi yɛɛ saa.
I have a mostly comprehensive plan.	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe bi a ne fã kɛse no ara yɛ nea edi mũ.
It looks terrible today.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu nnɛ.
Imagine you are a dog or a cat.	Fa no sɛ woyɛ ɔkraman anaa ɔkraman.
We both know that.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa nim saa.
It is not very convenient.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
I couldn’t believe it was him	Na mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno
I face her so she can see them	Meyɛ no anim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a obetumi ahu wɔn
So, use it.	Enti, fa di dwuma.
It’s always going to be there	Ɛrekɔ hɔ bere nyinaa
Happy days have come again.	Anigye nna aba bio.
But there is no such pleasure.	Nanso anigye biara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
I never know what he will do	Minnim nea ɔbɛyɛ da
The situation can often be difficult.	Mpɛn pii no, tebea no betumi ayɛ den.
I brought some friends home	Mede me nnamfo bi baa fie
Logistics were complicated and therefore expensive.	Ná nneɛma a wɔde bɛkɔ no yɛ den ma enti na ne bo yɛ den.
However, I immediately recovered	Nanso, me ho tɔɔ me ntɛm ara
I could watch that all day	Ná metumi ahwɛ saa da mũ no nyinaa
I can’t get over that	Mintumi nni saa asɛm no so
This danger may have passed.	Ebia asiane yi atwam.
I have to work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma.
No one is ever good enough for them.	Obiara nyɛ papa mma wɔn da.
I was in a state of shock	Ná me ho ayɛ me den
There are a few reasons why.	Nneɛma kakraa bi na enti ɛte saa.
I think we might be able to work something out	Misusuw sɛ ebia yebetumi ayɛ biribi ho adwuma
I felt great.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ kɛse.
I have books here and there.	Mewɔ nhoma ahorow wɔ baabi ne baabi foforo.
I didn't even really know why	Ná minnim nea enti a ɛte saa mpo ankasa
That was pretty amazing.	Ná ɛno yɛ nwonwa yiye.
The installation is simple and very good.	Nneɛma a wɔde hyɛ mu no yɛ mmerɛw na eye yiye.
I did the job.	Meyɛɛ adwuma no.
I really wanted to know	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu ankasa
But her mother had already seen them.	Nanso na ne maame ahu wɔn dedaw.
I have a great idea now	Mewɔ adwene kɛse bi mprempren
Not even the best of all time.	Ɛnyɛ nea eye sen biara mpo wɔ bere nyinaa mu.
I didn’t have any money	Ná minni sika biara
But that goes for everyone, not just you.	Nanso ɛno kɔ ma obiara, ɛnyɛ wo nkutoo.
I think you all have done an awesome job	Misusuw sɛ mo nyinaa ayɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ hu
Truth be told.	Nokware nka.
I got some help from you.	Me nsa kaa wo mmoa bi.
It’s amazing to me.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa ma me.
And instead of doing that.	Na sɛ anka wobɛyɛ saa.
His or mine's.	Ne anaa me de.
But it was there, for both of us.	Nanso na ɛwɔ hɔ, ma yɛn baanu nyinaa.
He was not beautiful.	Ná ne ho nyɛ fɛ.
The story is absolutely true.	Asɛm no yɛ nokware koraa.
It was another beautiful thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade foforo a ɛyɛ fɛ.
That in itself is exciting.	Ɛno ankasa yɛ anigye.
We understand, somehow.	Yɛ te ase, ɔkwan bi so.
That at least we have this on film.	Sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, yɛwɔ eyi wɔ sini mu.
No one talks about my mother.	Obiara nka me maame ho asɛm.
And I don’t think you like it	Na minsusuw sɛ w’ani gye ho
This is a terrible idea.	Eyi yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ hu.
I understand what you want, and I can easily implement it	Mete nea wopɛ ase, na ɛnyɛ den sɛ metumi de adi dwuma
The group is excited.	Kuw no ani agye.
Put your foot in the seed.	Fa wo nan to aba.
But that’s not the fun part of this experiment.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne sɔhwɛ yi fã a ɛyɛ anigye.
He ended the shot.	Ɔde tuo no baa awiei.
There is nothing new about that.	Biribi foforo biara nni saa asɛm no ho.
I love you so much	Mepɛ wo paa
I put my hand on his head	Mede me nsa hyɛ ne ti mu
I didn’t like him at all	Ná mempɛ no koraa
I don't know who looked weak on that one	Minnim onii a na ɔte sɛ nea ɔyɛ mmerɛw wɔ saa biako no so
I can't get to the table tonight	Mintumi nkɔ pon no so anadwo yi
I would definitely do it differently	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ anka mɛyɛ no ɔkwan foforo so
He has been here for many years.	Ɔde mfe pii ayɛ ha.
I can’t put my child through that	Mintumi mfa me ba no mfa saa asɛm no mu
I don't know why it's in the picture.	Minnim nea enti a ɛwɔ mfonini no mu.
I don’t know him for sure.	Minnim no yiye.
I signed it off.	Mede me nsa hyɛɛ ase.
I have no idea what to do	Minni nea mɛyɛ ho adwene biara
So keep going.	Enti kɔ so.
Certainly not very attractive.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
I can’t convince myself	Mintumi mma me ho nnye nni
Almost everyone touched it deeply.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara kaa no kɛse.
Whatever you have to do, do it.	Biribiara a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no, yɛ.
I used to have terrible problems at his age	Kan no na mewɔ ɔhaw ahorow a ɛyɛ hu wɔ ne mfe mu
You are so strong and beautiful and strong.	Wo ho yɛ den na wo ho yɛ fɛ na wo ho yɛ den yiye.
That’s how it worked.	Saa na na ɛyɛ adwuma.
They are not happy.	Wɔn ani nnye.
I was sleeping in my new bed	Ná meda me mpa foforo no so
His crying grew.	Ne su no yɛɛ kɛse.
Read.	Kan.
He was very involved.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu kɛse.
I can’t tell you how wrong this feels	Mintumi nka sɛnea eyi te nka sɛ ɛyɛ mfomso no nkyerɛ wo
Something is wrong.	Biribi yɛ bɔne.
You can enjoy it here right now.	Wubetumi anya mu anigye wɔ ha mprempren ara.
That approach results in fewer errors.	Saa kwan no mma mfomso pii mma.
I don’t like that at all	M’ani nnye ho saa koraa
I knew what was next.	Ná minim nea edi hɔ.
I'm gonna do it anyway.	Me deɛ, mɛyɛ no ɔkwan biara so.
The course is long.	Adesua no tenten.
I looked forward to hanging out with my school friends	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ me ne me sukuu nnamfo bɛbɔ
I couldn’t really say	Na mintumi nka ankasa
This is a great value.	Eyi yɛ bo kɛse.
I didn’t really know what to say then either.	Saa bere no nso na minnim nea mɛka ankasa.
He didn't know why.	Ná onnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
I think everyone knows	Misusuw sɛ obiara nim
And he was great.	Na ɔyɛ kɛse.
I just can’t understand it	Mintumi nte ase kɛkɛ
But it will be good, trust me.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ papa, gye me di.
I really liked this boy	M’ani gyee abarimaa yi ho paa
Something is going wrong.	Biribi rekɔ so anyɛ yiye.
Let him go.	Ma no nkɔ.
He was a handsome man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I have their works in the background	Mewɔ wɔn nnwuma no wɔ akyi
Take care of it.	Hwɛ so yiye.
She was absolutely amazing.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa koraa.
He knew what had happened.	Ná onim nea asi.
I am with the most popular girl in school	Me ne abeawa a nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho sen biara wɔ sukuu mu no wɔ hɔ
We are your new best friends.	Yɛyɛ wo nnamfo paa foforo.
I know you know how that feels	Minim sɛ wunim sɛnea ɛno te nka
I want you to come here with me	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me ba ha
I think about him a lot at night	Misusuw ne ho pii anadwo
I see beautiful things every day	Mihu nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ da biara da
And in that moment, something happened to him.	Na saa bere no mu no, biribi too no.
I just knew there was something to this	Ná minim ara kwa sɛ biribi wɔ eyi mu
The other side of the door gave way.	Ɔpon no fã foforo nso maa kwan.
I just enjoyed it so much.	M’ani gyee ho yiye ara kwa.
Really sorry about that right now.	Ankasa kyɛw wɔ saa asɛm no ho mprempren ara.
I don’t know that for sure.	Minnim saa asɛm no yiye.
I can't start until after next week	Mintumi mfi ase kosi sɛ dapɛn a edi hɔ no akyi
I could take care of them with my life	Ná metumi de me nkwa ahwɛ wɔn
And they were shocked.	Na wɔn ho dwiriw wɔn.
I want to see my friends.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu me nnamfo.
And, somehow, it had.	Na, ɔkwan bi so no, na ɛwɔ.
But usually not too helpful in this situation.	Nanso mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ mmoa dodo wɔ tebea yi mu.
However, this year is a disaster.	Nanso, afe yi yɛ asiane.
I have to introduce myself	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda me ho adi
I have to go now, work you know	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ mprempren, adwuma wunim
I worked on it.	Meyɛɛ ho adwuma.
I saw that when you were a kid.	Mihuu saa bere a na woyɛ abofra no.
The further the group went.	Dodow a kuw no kɔɔ akyiri no.
That really surprised me.	Ɛno maa me ho dwiriw me ankasa.
A real job	Adwuma ankasa
I’d love that a lot.	M’ani begye saa asɛm no ho kɛse.
My feet were a horrible thing.	Ná me nan yɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu.
I was never good at this	Ná menyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw wɔ eyi mu da
Not today, not tomorrow, next week or next month.	Ɛnyɛ nnɛ, ɛnyɛ ɔkyena, dapɛn a edi hɔ anaa ɔsram a edi hɔ no.
Get yourself out there and trust it.	Fa wo ho kɔ hɔ na fa wo ho to so.
Most of my friends do the same.	Me nnamfo dodow no ara yɛ saa ara.
It was a real problem.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔhaw ankasa.
Your name has a lot of power still.	Wo din wɔ tumi pii da so ara.
We have to use it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde di dwuma.
Maybe you can talk about it.	Ebia wubetumi aka ho asɛm.
The team was the most important thing.	Ná kuw no ne ade a ɛho hia sen biara.
No one could be more beautiful than her mother.	Obiara ntumi nyɛ fɛ sen ne maame.
I know your name well	Minim wo din pa
He’s excited about something.	N’ani agye biribi ho.
I knew why he had done it	Ná minim nea enti a wayɛ saa
I’m also interested in why	M’ani gye nea enti a ɛte saa nso ho
If you do that.	Sɛ woyɛ saa a.
And he did so.	Na ɔyɛɛ saa.
He could do so much for her.	Ná obetumi ayɛ no nneɛma pii.
There is a saying	Asɛm bi ka sɛ .
I can use yours, though	Nanso, metumi de wo de no adi dwuma
I think it’s a sin.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne.
Be careful and look at me.	Hwɛ yiye na hwɛ me.
For me, it was important.	Wɔ me fam no, na ɛho hia.
This is a very professional move.	Eyi yɛ ade a obi a ɔyɛ adwuma yiye koraa tu.
This really worked.	Eyi yɛɛ adwuma ampa.
There is no pleasure.	Anigye biara nni hɔ.
A very bad thing.	Ade bɔne paa.
When everyone gives what they have, they are happy.	Sɛ obiara de nea ɔwɔ ma a, n’ani gye.
The following scenario must take place over a period of time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ tebea a edi hɔ yi kɔ so wɔ bere bi mu.
Designed and coordinated the study.	Ɔyɛɛ adesua no ho nhyehyɛe na ɔyɛɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
They both knew this game well.	Ná wɔn baanu nim saa agoru yi yiye.
Let someone do it.	Ma obi nyɛ.
Just like alcohol.	Te sɛ nsa ara pɛ.
There was no need to do anything.	Na ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ biribiara.
I couldn’t make it happen	Na mintumi mma ɛnyɛ saa
That sounds much better.	Ɛno te sɛ nea eye kɛse.
Don't take that literally.	Mfa saa asɛm no nyɛ nokware ankasa.
I am doing well now.	Mereyɛ yiye mprempren.
I could have been there	Anka metumi akɔ hɔ
This system has been working for a long time.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi ayɛ adwuma bere tenten ni.
I was human and something else	Ná meyɛ onipa ne biribi foforo
It’s important.	Ɛho hia.
I knew it would be beautiful	Ná minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ fɛ yiye
He was a man, after all.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima, ne nyinaa akyi no, na ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ɔyɛ ɔbarima yiye.
There are some days.	Nna bi wɔ hɔ.
Our reaction can be described as such.	Yebetumi aka sɛnea yɛyɛ yɛn ade wɔ ho no ho asɛm sɛ ɛte saa.
After that, it was easy.	Ɛno akyi no, na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
However, I could not thank him	Nanso, na mintumi nna no ase
I should be happy for you, for all of us	Ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani gye ma wo, ma yɛn nyinaa
This is how it works.	Eyi ne sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma.
On the street.	Wɔ abɔnten so.
But it feels all new.	Nanso ɔte nka sɛ ne nyinaa yɛ foforo.
There is still hope.	Anidaso da so ara wɔ hɔ.
I provide meal planning and daily support	Mede aduan ho nhyehyɛe ne mmoa a wɔde ma da biara da ma
Apparently he was.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔte saa.
Of that there is no doubt.	Ɛno ho asɛm no, akyinnye biara nni ho.
I don’t care about his problems.	Ne haw ahorow no mfa me ho.
I want to know the details	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nsɛm no mu nsɛm kɔ akyiri
Apparently he had been to the party too.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔno nso akɔ apontow no ase.
In order to be able to do so.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wubetumi ayɛ saa.
Whatever else.	Nea aka biara.
Introduce you to people who will be interested in you.	Fa wo kyerɛ nnipa a wɔn ani begye wo ho.
I didn’t know he had one	Ná minnim sɛ ɔwɔ bi
I had a perfect longevity	Ná mewɔ nkwa tenten a ɛyɛ pɛ
That was really true.	Ná ɛno yɛ nokware ankasa.
He was my big baby.	Ná ɔyɛ me ba kɛse.
He was a father.	Ná ɔyɛ papa.
There was my cell.	Ná me afiase dan no wɔ hɔ.
And he didn’t want to do that.	Na na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
The latter is an easy target.	Nea etwa to no yɛ nea ɛnyɛ den sɛ wɔde wɔn ani besi so.
I always went home alone	Ná me nkutoo na mekɔ fie bere nyinaa
I have other things for you to do	Mewɔ nneɛma foforo a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ
Go take your chance.	Kɔ fa hokwan a wowɔ no di dwuma.
Tonight, we have a little bit of both.	Anadwo yi, yɛwɔ abien no nyinaa kakra.
So much happened that year.	Enti nneɛma pii sii wɔ saa afe no mu.
The school closed.	Sukuu no too mu.
Make the most of every available moment.	Fa bere biara a ɛwɔ hɔ no di dwuma yiye.
He could do this visually or independently.	Ná obetumi de n’ani ahwɛ anaa ɔde ne ho ayɛ eyi.
Put us in the box.	Fa yɛn hyɛ.
I can't even begin to understand why	Mintumi mfi ase mpo nte nea enti a ɔyɛ saa no ase
They just had to be quick.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ntɛm ara kwa.
He sounds familiar.	Ɔte sɛ nea onim no yiye.
I know what’s going on here	Minim nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ ha
I think about it a lot.	Misusuw ho pii.
At least not for reasons.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ nneɛma nti.
I was getting hard again, already	Na mereyɛ den bio, dedaw
This year has been great so far.	Afe yi ayɛ kɛse de besi nnɛ.
They were both good at it.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa ho akokwaw wɔ mu.
A look he should have known better	Hwɛ a anka ɛsɛ sɛ onim no yiye
I could never be like you	Na mintumi nyɛ sɛ wo da
Give him plenty of water.	Ma no nsu pii.
I think that’s really it	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne no ankasa
There was trouble here.	Ná ɔhaw wɔ ha.
I really thought he was the one	Misusuwii ampa sɛ ɔno ne obi a ɔte saa
And this is true.	Na eyi yɛ nokware.
I can't have this happening in my house	Mintumi nnya eyi a ɛrekɔ so wɔ me fie
I want to go through them all with you	Mepɛ sɛ me ne mo fa wɔn nyinaa mu
If he wasn’t there, he had a problem.	Sɛ na onni hɔ a, na ɔwɔ ɔhaw bi.
That day continues to be.	Saa da no kɔ so yɛ nea...
This past week, this did not seem to work.	Dapɛn a etwaam yi, na ɛte sɛ nea eyi anyɛ adwuma.
We were both very happy.	Na yɛn baanu nyinaa ani agye yiye.
It was a job.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma.
This method has many interesting features.	Saa kwan yi wɔ nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ anigye.
It’s bad for everyone.	Ɛyɛ bɔne ma obiara.
It’s me.	Ɛyɛ me.
This will be the lesson.	Eyi bɛyɛ adesua no.
So you tell me.	Enti woka kyerɛ me.
That’s why my legs wanted so badly to go.	Ɛno nti na na me nan pɛ kɛse sɛ mekɔ no.
It was obviously a mistake.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛyɛ mfomso.
He’s the big guy.	Ɔno ne ɔbarima kɛse no.
It’s not really as simple as that.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw te sɛ ɛno ankasa.
I didn’t know what to do	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ
It shouldn’t matter.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛho hia.
Very interesting work	Adwuma a ɛyɛ anigye yiye
It was a human head, with a bottom.	Ná ɛyɛ onipa ti, a na ɛwɔ ase.
I admire your wisdom and intelligence	M’ani gye wo nyansa ne wo nyansa ho
At least for a few days.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, nna kakraa bi.
I have so many other things to do.	Mewɔ nneɛma foforo pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
I couldn’t sleep in our bed	Ná mintumi nna yɛn mpa so
He is, to you, perfect in every way.	Ɔyɛ, wɔ mo fam no, ɔyɛ pɛ wɔ biribiara mu.
This is the aka.	Eyi aka.
I still can’t figure it out	Meda so ara ntumi nsusuw ho
I didn’t want to see him like that.	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu no saa.
Always ahead of his time.	Bere nyinaa a odi ne bere anim.
I really like them both	M’ani gye wɔn baanu nyinaa ho ankasa
It’s really exciting for me.	Ɛyɛ anigye ankasa ma me.
I recognized you from the picture in your books	Mihuu mo fii mfonini a ɛwɔ mo nhoma ahorow mu no mu
Mom still loves it.	Maame da so ara ani gye ho.
I want to do this job.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa adwuma yi.
I really wanted to go with them	Ná mepɛ paa sɛ me ne wɔn kɔ
It’s going to work.	Ɛrekɔ adwuma.
I think about it before lunch	Misusuw ho ansa na adu awia aduan
It’s totally up to you how you want to, like, do things.	Ɛyɛ wo koraa sɛnea wopɛ, te sɛ, yɛ nneɛma.
I have better things to do with my mind	Mewɔ nneɛma pa a mede m’adwene bɛyɛ
Here is the problem.	Ɔhaw no ni.
We loved it here.	Yɛn ani gyee ho wɔ ha.
I don’t know what to do or say	Minnim nea mɛyɛ anaa mɛka
A terrible thought came to me	Adwene a ɛyɛ hu bi baa me so
I will use it effectively.	Mede bedi dwuma yiye.
I really shouldn’t say this.	Ankasa ɛnsɛ sɛ meka eyi.
They will be given.	Wɔde bɛma.
On paper, that approach sounds pretty good.	Wɔ krataa so no, saa kwan no te sɛ nea eye yiye.
I really like this book.	M’ani gye nhoma yi ho paa.
I admired him for that.	M’ani gyee ne ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I should have been happy	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani gye
I wonder if the picture is recent or not	Misusuw sɛ ebia mfonini no yɛ nnansa yi ara anaasɛ ɛnte saa
I even made friends with a few of them	Me ne wɔn mu kakraa bi mpo faa nnamfo
I even look forward to the next chapter.	Mehwɛ ti a edi hɔ no kwan mpo.
He knew exactly what he wanted	Ná onim nea ɔpɛ no yiye
I know no one knew about this	Minim sɛ na obiara nnim eyi ho asɛm
He doesn’t want you.	Ɔmpɛ wo.
It is the same in both cases.	Ɛyɛ ade koro wɔ nsɛm abien no nyinaa mu.
I look at him with interest	Mede anigye hwɛ no
She tells him she is busy.	Ɔka kyerɛ no sɛ onni adagyew.
I didn’t like it very much	Ná m’ani nnye ho kɛse
Making an interesting film outside of that is difficult.	Sɛ́ wobɛyɛ sini a ɛyɛ anigye a ɛwɔ saa akyi no yɛ den.
He didn’t want this.	Ná ɔmpɛ eyi.
I was excited.	Ná m’ani agye.
I am in you and you are in me	Mewɔ wo mu na wo nso wowɔ me mu
You told us at the time that it would be temporary.	Woka kyerɛɛ yɛn saa bere no sɛ ɛbɛyɛ bere tiaa mu de.
I was sleeping in one bedroom	Ná meda mpa biako mu
There is absolutely nothing wrong with it.	Mfomso biara nni ho koraa.
It has been a pleasure to work with him.	Ayɛ anigye sɛ me ne no bɛyɛ adwuma.
I took them all home	Mede wɔn nyinaa kɔɔ fie
And I'm fine with you being an animal	Na meyɛ no yiye sɛ woyɛ aboa
A good idea then, and a good idea still.	Adwene pa a na ɛte saa bere no, na adwene pa a ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ.
It is stronger than one man.	Ɛyɛ den sen ɔbarima biako.
Thank you for all your hours.	Meda wo ase wɔ wo nnɔnhwerew nyinaa ho.
I should be happy right now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani gye mprempren ara.
I think you are what you are	Misusuw sɛ woyɛ nea woyɛ
It will look and feel solid.	Ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ den na ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ den.
All you have to do is use it.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ara ne sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
More details will be coming soon.	Nsɛm pii bɛba nnansa yi ara.
He wants to do something.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
I think of the greater good	Misusuw papa kɛse no ho
Maybe that’s why it’s so.	Ebia ɛno nti na ɛte saa.
I’m absolutely thrilled	M’ani gye ho koraa
That was another reason my mom wanted to get involved.	Ɛno ne ade foforo nti a na me maame pɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu no.
But that is nothing new.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ ade foforo.
It’s not that good either.	Ɛnyɛ papa saa nso.
It was really just awesome.	Ná ɛyɛ hu ara kwa ankasa.
It’s just sleep.	Ɛyɛ nna ara kwa.
It’s a long one.	Ɛyɛ tenten.
I couldn’t go on like that	Na mintumi nkɔ so saa
I loved the movie.	M’ani gyee sini no ho.
All in all, something interesting.	Ne nyinaa mu no, biribi a ɛyɛ anigye.
We can’t do anything exciting this week.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ anigye dapɛn yi.
See below for details.	Hwɛ ase hɔ ma nsɛm no mu nsɛm.
And so the police just left the scene.	Na enti polisifo no fii baabi a asɛm no sii no ara kwa.
That’s the first time he’s shown it.	Ɛno ne bere a edi kan a ɔde akyerɛ.
I didn’t know how to proceed	Ná minnim sɛnea mɛkɔ so ayɛ
Nor do they care.	Saa ara nso na ɛho nhia wɔn.
Not in the past.	Ɛnyɛ bere a atwam no mu.
Anything they do well, is great at.	Biribiara a wɔyɛ no yiye no, yɛ kɛse wɔ mu.
I think what we will do is this	Misusuw sɛ nea yɛbɛyɛ ne eyi
I had to do it this way	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ no saa kwan yi so
I didn’t have anyone else	Na minni obiara bio
I am not alone in this surprise	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na eyi yɛ me nwonwa
It’s not cheap.	Ɛnyɛ nea ne bo yɛ mmerɛw.
But that’s not perfect either.	Nanso ɛno nso nyɛ pɛ.
I should have said I would take the book with me	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ mede nhoma no bɛkɔ
It should have been.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
I have this problem lately	Mewɔ ɔhaw yi nnansa yi
Neither may win much.	Ebia mu biara nni nkonim kɛse.
We update this information as often as possible.	Yɛyɛ saa nsɛm yi foforo mpɛn pii sɛnea yebetumi.
I can’t go through this anymore	Mintumi mfa eyi mu bio
Do it for us, you know.	Yɛ ma yɛn, wunim.
The man was not human.	Ná ɔbarima no nyɛ onipa.
I don't know what you say you just know.	Minnim nea woka sɛ wunim ara kwa.
It’s really fun to be able to do it.	Ɛyɛ anigye ankasa sɛ wubetumi ayɛ.
I always wanted to be like my dad.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ sɛ me papa bere nyinaa.
Such a cute kid, too.	Abofra a ne ho yɛ fɛ saa, nso.
I did this and it works.	Meyɛɛ eyi na ɛyɛ adwuma.
Trust me on this one thing.	Fa wo ho to me so wɔ ade biako yi ho.
What you say goes away.	Nea woka no kɔ.
I want to believe him	Mepɛ sɛ migye no di
Now money seems to be flowing freely.	Mprempren ɛte sɛ nea sika rekɔ so kwa.
Or if there is, tell me what it is.	Anaa sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ a, ka nea ɛyɛ kyerɛ me.
We concluded that it was not.	Yɛde baa awiei sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
People got over it.	Nkurɔfo nyaa so nkonim.
I think he did something to his car	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛɛ ne kar no ho biribi
Thank you for the wonderful dinner.	Meda mo ase wɔ anwummere aduan a ɛyɛ anigye no ho.
I can do things for you	Metumi ayɛ nneɛma ama wo
Things go horribly wrong.	Nneɛma kɔ bɔne koraa.
If something happens to you.	Sɛ biribi to wo a.
I'm sorry they have to.	Mepa wo kyɛw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
You are among friends here.	Woka nnamfo ho wɔ ha.
That’s not what we do.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea yɛyɛ.
But he can control it.	Nanso obetumi adi so.
Imagine what that must be like.	Susuw sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛno te ho hwɛ.
I have only done half of that	Ɛno fã pɛ na mayɛ
But you are right about one thing.	Nanso woayɛ no yiye wɔ ade biako ho.
This support does not exist.	Saa mmoa yi nni hɔ.
I’m really enjoying it	M’ani gyee ho paa
It’s not the first time this has happened.	Ɛnyɛ bere a edi kan a eyi asi.
Food creates a mood like nothing else.	Aduan ma tebea bi te sɛ biribi foforo biara.
I knew he was taking a risk	Ná minim sɛ ɔreyɛ asiane
It wasn’t a bad idea, though.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ adwene bɔne.
He draws his own conclusions.	Ɔno ankasa de nsɛm ba awiei.
It’s a real picture.	Ɛyɛ mfonini ankasa.
Do that.	Yɛ saa.
I am really sorry about that	Ɛyɛ me yaw ankasa wɔ saa asɛm no ho
He thought about it carefully.	Osusuw ho yiye.
That’s just the way the system works.	Ɛno ne ɔkwan a nhyehyɛe no fa so yɛ adwuma ara kwa.
I want to get to know him better	Mepɛ sɛ mihu no yiye
I would feel the same way	Anka me nso mete nka saa ara
And if someone does us.	Na sɛ obi yɛ yɛn.
I hear he loves books	Mete sɛ n’ani gye nhoma ho
The music kept playing.	Nnwom no kɔɔ so bɔɔ.
Anyone can help me.	Obiara betumi aboa me.
I know you know that	Minim sɛ wunim saa
Such a great song.	Dwom kɛse a ɛte saa.
I had to do that something	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa biribi no
People talk about it.	Nkurɔfo ka ho asɛm.
I didn’t know about it at the time	Saa bere no na minnim ho hwee
Surrender.	Ma wo nsa so.
Or more like one and a half.	Anaasɛ nea ɛte sɛ biako ne fã kɛse.
That said, it’s pretty simple.	Ɛno akyi no, ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
I think you’ll enjoy it	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye ho
We’re all going to.	Yɛn nyinaa rekɔ.
I think it will be interesting	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ anigye
I was still afraid of the unknown	Ná meda so ara suro nea minnim no
We have	Yɛde .
Something will happen.	Biribi bɛba.
Here's what you have.	Nea wowɔ ni.
And take and take and take	Na fa ne fa ne fa
He wanted it done this way.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no saa kwan yi so.
Let everyone go there.	Ma obiara nkɔ hɔ.
I have to think about what you said	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw nea wokae no ho
Watch what he says, and talk about it carefully.	Hwɛ nea ɔka, na ka ho asɛm yiye.
I expected it to be fine	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye
If you use that one, you will be fine.	Sɛ wode saa biako no di dwuma a, wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
And you can’t have it.	Na worentumi nnya bi.
I know him as well as anyone.	Minim no yiye sɛnea obiara nim no.
I knew exactly what that was like	Ná minim sɛnea ɛno te no yiye
Which in my father’s case, is just me.	Nea wɔ me papa asɛm no mu no, ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
It was like being a kid again.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea meyɛ abofra bio.
I could almost share power with them.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na metumi ne wɔn akyɛ tumi.
This happened every night.	Eyi sii anadwo biara.
It should be enough.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛdɔɔso.
But forget it, man.	Nanso wo werɛ mfi, onipa.
And this costs money.	Na eyi gye sika.
Just the way you want it.	Sɛnea wopɛ no ara pɛ.
I can’t let you do it alone.	Mintumi mma wo nkutoo nyɛ.
But at that time.	Nanso saa bere no.
A week ago he didn’t know where he was	Dapɛn biako a atwam ni no na onnim baabi a ɔwɔ
I haven't thought about it in a long time.	Minsusuw ho bere tenten ni.
Reach out to us and start that story.	Fa wo nsa ka yɛn na fi ase saa asɛm no.
I have to tell them everything	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribiara kyerɛ wɔn
A good majority hoped he would.	Ná dodow no ara a eye wɔ anidaso sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
It’s not happening.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so.
I was nervous about working.	Ná me ho dwiriw me sɛ mɛyɛ adwuma.
What's left.	Nea aka.
Not one man.	Ɛnyɛ ɔbarima biako.
At the same time, something good was happening.	Bere koro no ara mu no, na biribi pa bi rekɔ so.
The time is his.	Bere no yɛ ne de.
Do they do that.	So wɔyɛ saa.
Your a good risk.	Wo asiane pa.
But only what there is.	Nanso nea ɛwɔ hɔ nkutoo.
Next time we do this.	Bere foforo a yɛbɛyɛ eyi.
I could have done that	Anka metumi ayɛ saa
That one took me a while.	Saa biako no gyee me bere kakra.
I also tell him thank you	Meka kyerɛ no nso sɛ meda ase
How can I do that?	Mɛyɛ dɛn ayɛ saa.
I didn’t think about them	Ná minsusuw wɔn ho
Say bio.	Ka bio.
I wish you were here with me	Me yam a anka wo ne me wɔ ha
There are no windows .	Mfɛnsere biara nni hɔ .
Nothing is ever perfect, nor is it ever complete.	Biribiara nni hɔ a edi mũ da, na saa ara nso na edi mũ da.
We have things to work on.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho adwuma.
But it’s true.	Nanso ɛyɛ nokware.
Just tell me about it.	Ka kyerɛ me kɛkɛ.
Only do it if you really like it.	Sɛ w’ani gye ho ankasa nkutoo a, yɛ.
I didn’t really know what to do	Ná minnim nea menyɛ ankasa
I tell him how much it costs	Meka sika dodow a ɛho ka kyerɛ no
And it may still be able to do so.	Na ebia ɛda so ara betumi ayɛ saa.
I think part of that will be my fault	Misusuw sɛ ɛno fã bi bɛyɛ me mfomso
You can do things in your size !.	Wubetumi ayɛ nneɛma wɔ wo kɛse !.
Why he did it doesn’t matter.	Nea enti a ɔyɛɛ saa no mfa ho.
We will do our best.	Yɛbɛyɛ nea yebetumi biara.
Anyone could do them.	Ná obiara betumi ayɛ wɔn.
I saw the whole thing.	Mihuu ade no nyinaa.
At the time, I never thought about it.	Saa bere no, minsusuw ho hwee da.
Most don’t.	Dodow no ara nyɛ saa.
I always felt out of place	Ná mete nka bere nyinaa sɛ minni baabi
Take the kids away.	Fa mmofra no kɔ.
It is not difficult at all.	Ɛnyɛ den koraa.
We can’t see him.	Yɛrentumi nhu no.
He put me in it.	Ɔde me hyɛɛ mu.
I admired him for it.	M’ani gyee ne ho wɔ ho.
I just didn't want to say anything	Ná mempɛ sɛ meka hwee kɛkɛ
It’s a lot of fun and very flexible.	Ɛyɛ anigye pii na ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
The time for that is past.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa no atwam.
It hurts me to say anything now	Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ meka biribiara mprempren
What it is	Nea ɛyɛ .
I know this is all temporary	Minim sɛ eyi nyinaa yɛ bere tiaa mu de
We both knew the truth.	Ná yɛn baanu nyinaa nim nokware no.
I did it just a week ago	Meyɛɛ no ​​dapɛn biako a atwam ni ara pɛ
I knew what was going on in your minds	Ná minim nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ mo adwene mu
This weekend is with you.	Saa dapɛn awiei yi wɔ wo nkyɛn.
His words, not mine.	Ne nsɛm, ɛnyɛ me de.
I can bring some things	Metumi de nneɛma bi aba
Food for the mind.	Aduan a wɔde ma adwene.
This is a pretty good deal in just one month.	Eyi yɛ ade a eye yiye wɔ ɔsram biako pɛ mu.
I need to see him again	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no bio
His desire for her was already dangerously strong.	Ná ɔpɛ a ɔwɔ ma no no mu yɛ den wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu so dedaw.
I'm doing that.	Meyɛ saa.
You have done the best you can.	Woayɛ nea eye sen biara a wubetumi.
This thing was starting to play out.	Ná saa ade yi afi ase rebɔ.
I really want to like them.	Mepɛ sɛ m’ani gye wɔn ho ankasa.
Said to be one of the best.	Wɔka sɛ nea eye sen biara no mu biako.
I would take the leather with me	Ná mede aboa nhoma no bɛkɔ
I should have told you	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo
I like complicated things.	M’ani gye nneɛma a ɛyɛ den ho.
And therefore, only we can really do anything about it.	Na ɛno nti, yɛn nkutoo na yebetumi ayɛ ho biribiara ankasa.
I always did that with animals	Ná meyɛ saa bere nyinaa wɔ mmoa ho
People knew them.	Ná nkurɔfo nim wɔn.
It’s my leg, it’s my leg.	Ɛyɛ me nan, ɛyɛ me nan.
He is all about money now.	Ɔyɛ sika nkutoo ho asɛm mprempren.
For a short time.	Bere tiaa bi.
He was at home.	Ná ɔwɔ fie.
I saw what you could do	Mihuu nea wubetumi ayɛ
Here’s how you can help.	Sɛnea wubetumi aboa ni.
I’m so excited.	M’ani agye yiye.
I worked there as an intern.	Meyɛɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ sɛ obi a ɔyɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ.
It was all overwhelming.	Ná ne nyinaa yɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
I’m not sure he knew where everything was	M’ani nnye ho sɛ na onim baabi a biribiara wɔ
What better way to do it.	Ɔkwan bɛn na eye sen saa.
Hopefully there will be more to come.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ pii bɛba bio.
That was something that was really important to our team.	Ná ɛno yɛ biribi a na ɛho hia yɛn kuw no ankasa.
The picture shows him sitting in his car.	Mfonini no kyerɛ sɛ ɔte ne kar mu.
All the same, wonderful hands.	Ne nyinaa yɛ pɛ, nsa a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I know this hasn’t been easy for you	Minim sɛ eyi anyɛ mmerɛw amma wo
I didn’t know there was so much more involved	Ná minnim sɛ nneɛma pii ka ho saa
I would appreciate it if you could help me	Sɛ wubetumi aboa me a, m’ani begye ho
I just want to be me	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ me ho ara kwa
I can move it from room to room incredibly quickly.	Metumi de afi dan mu akɔ dan mu ntɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
The end would be quick.	Ná awiei no bɛyɛ ntɛm.
I could do this with you all day	Metumi ne wo ayɛ eyi da mũ nyinaa
There was really nothing to do.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ankasa.
I have a plan for you	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe ma wo
There was little time.	Ná bere kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I have to say something	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribi
So will his mother.	Saa ara na ne maame nso bɛyɛ.
That makes me happy.	Ɛno ma m’ani gye.
I just wanted it all to go away	Ná mepɛ sɛ ne nyinaa kɔ kɛkɛ
And this is our opportunity.	Na eyi ne yɛn hokwan.
For me this is important.	Wɔ me fam no eyi ho hia.
I could have been in any of them	Anka metumi akɔ wɔn mu biara mu
I hope your weekend is going well	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo dapɛn awiei no rekɔ yiye
And their it was recently.	Na wɔn ɛyɛ nnansa yi ara.
Everyone.	Obiara.
I have to say everything was absolutely fantastic	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ na biribiara yɛ nwonwa koraa
The door, the front door.	Ɔpon no, anim pon no.
I think this approach is wrong	Misusuw sɛ saa kwan yi yɛ mfomso
Take it back to the country.	Fa no san kɔ.
None of them did.	Wɔn mu biara anyɛ saa.
I thought he might have forgotten to tell you	Misusuwii sɛ ebia na ne werɛ afi sɛ ɔbɛka akyerɛ wo
That approach was not good.	Ná saa kwan no nyɛ papa.
I'm doing something new at this point	Meyɛ ade foforo wɔ saa bere yi mu
But it doesn’t seem to work.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I needed to know more about him	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu ne ho nsɛm pii
I wonder how much time has passed since then.	Misusuw bere tenten ahe na atwam fi saa bere no ho.
Many people do better with their hands than book study.	Nnipa pii de wɔn nsa yɛ papa sen nhoma adesua.
You’ll enjoy this.	W’ani begye eyi ho.
I'm a scientist.	Meyɛ ɔkraman.
No one could see me.	Obiara antumi anhu me.
I thought you had power.	Misusuwii sɛ wowɔ tumi.
I felt like it, anyway.	Metee nka sɛ ɛte saa, sɛnea ɛte biara.
Here is one way.	Ɔkwan biako ni.
That’s all as it was.	Ɛno nyinaa te sɛ nea na ɛte no.
I always seemed to have an appointment	Ná ɛte sɛ nea bere nyinaa na mewɔ bere bi a ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ
This isn’t even the same way he placed me.	Eyi nyɛ ɔkwan koro no ara mpo a ɔde me too hɔ no.
I really enjoyed his part	M’ani gyee ne fã no ho ankasa
I was really good at that	Na meyɛ obi a me ho akokwaw wɔ saa asɛm no mu ankasa
I saw the problem.	Mihuu ɔhaw no.
I believe there is a problem	Migye di sɛ ɔhaw bi aba
A new one was needed	Ná ɛho hia sɛ wɔyɛ foforo
He told me to smile.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me.
A trial was held for three days	Wɔde nnansa dii asɛm bi
First, the good ones.	Nea edi kan no, nea eye no.
I will do anything for you	Mɛyɛ biribiara ama wo
They all look this or similar.	Wɔn nyinaa hwɛ eyi anaasɛ ɛte saa ara.
I think he really likes me	Misusuw sɛ n’ani gye me ho ankasa
He slammed the bottom door shut.	Ɔde ɔpon a ɛwɔ ase no bɔɔ mu.
But he didn’t have the resources.	Nanso na onni nneɛma a ɔde bɛyɛ saa.
There are two issues.	Nsɛm abien na ɛwɔ hɔ.
It’s in my head.	Ɛwɔ me ti so.
I wasn’t thinking clearly	Ná minsusuw nneɛma ho yiye
I saw him later in his room	Mihuu no akyiri yi wɔ ne dan mu
Everything man has told you is a lie.	Biribiara a onipa aka akyerɛ wo no yɛ atoro.
These plans should come in time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nhyehyɛe ahorow yi ba bere bi akyi.
Every part of him felt numb.	Ná ne fã biara te nka sɛ wayɛ mmerɛw.
Put your hand here.	Fa wo nsa to ha.
I had to go further	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ akyiri
Admit your sins.	Gye wo bɔne tom.
I had no idea there was so much in it	Ná minnim sɛ nneɛma pii wɔ mu saa
However, it was not a plan at all.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe koraa.
I could respect that.	Ná metumi abu saa asɛm no.
They do that.	Wɔyɛ saa.
I guess the water had to be pretty warm there	Misusuw sɛ na ɛsɛ sɛ nsu no yɛ hyew yiye wɔ hɔ
It would be much better if we did.	Sɛ yɛyɛ saa a, anka ɛbɛyɛ papa kɛse.
It was bigger than that.	Ná ɛyɛ kɛse sen saa.
I didn’t know what else to do or say	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ anaa mɛka bio
And he will continue to do so.	Na ɔbɛkɔ so ayɛ saa.
The time is up.	Bere no aba awiei.
All of those things were true.	Ná saa nneɛma no nyinaa yɛ nokware.
We can do that.	Yebetumi ayɛ saa.
That’s not my problem.	Ɛnyɛ me haw ne no.
That means a few things.	Ɛno kyerɛ nneɛma kakraa bi.
You know what that means.	Wunim nea ɛno kyerɛ.
I like the first one.	M’ani gye nea edi kan no ho.
I had one installed at my previous job	Ná mewɔ biako a wɔde ahyɛ mu wɔ me adwuma a atwam no mu
I've always had a soft spot for it	Mewɔ baabi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ma no bere nyinaa
This is such a situation.	Eyi yɛ tebea a ɛte saa.
All systems go wrong.	Nhyehyɛe ahorow nyinaa kɔ bɔne mu.
Like I would in my room.	Te sɛ nea mɛyɛ wɔ me dan mu.
It was almost one.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ biako.
But that’s the nature of the story.	Nanso ɛno ne asɛm no su.
He gave the child his hand.	Ɔde ne nsa maa abofra no.
And for at least half the meal, no one said a word.	Na anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔ aduan no fã mu no, obiara anka asɛm biara.
Children know this.	Mmofra nim eyi.
Children were happy.	Ná mmofra ani gye.
People like him shouldn’t even exist.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ nnipa te sɛ ɔno mpo wɔ hɔ.
But no one came to the door.	Nanso obiara amma ɔpon no ano.
Let the good guys win.	Ma nnipa pa no nni nkonim.
It seems to be going well.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛrekɔ so yiye.
All of it again.	Ne nyinaa bio.
To communicate things.	Sɛ́ wobɛka nneɛma ho asɛm akyerɛ.
I think the problem goes deeper.	Misusuw sɛ ɔhaw no kɔ akyiri.
This went on for most of the season.	Eyi kɔɔ so wɔ bere no fã kɛse no ara mu.
I know the clothes were there	Minim sɛ na ntade no wɔ hɔ
I don’t want to work for someone else.	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma ma obi foforo.
I didn’t think it was me	Na minsusuw sɛ ɛyɛ me
It was powerful.	Ná tumi wom.
I felt pretty amazing about it	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye wɔ ho
There is nothing you can do about it.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ wɔ ho.
I saw this many times.	Mihuu eyi mpɛn pii.
I would go with dad	Ná me ne papa bɛkɔ
I take them in my arms	Mede wɔn ho hyɛ me nsa mu
I look forward to dealing with you again	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ me ne mo bedi bio
That’s not like him.	Ɛno nte sɛ ɔno.
However, I knew better	Nanso, na minim yiye
He seems to be himself.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔno ankasa.
There was no one there.	Ná obiara nni hɔ.
If not, move on.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, kɔ so.
They are worn on the garment	Wɔde hyɛ atade no so
He has to do everything himself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa yɛ biribiara.
I just knew he was	Ná minim ara kwa sɛ ɔte saa
I’m glad to have him here	M’ani agye sɛ mewɔ no wɔ ha
Like, about it actually, one day.	Te sɛ, bɛyɛ no ankasa, da koro.
I don’t know who or what that included	Minnim onii anaa nea na ɛno ka ho
At least it appears to be there.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ.
We can make a promise.	Yebetumi ahyɛ bɔ.
A moment of existence.	Bere tiaa bi a ɛwɔ hɔ.
I know you said not to use the phone	Minim sɛ wokae sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ wode telefon no di dwuma
We have plenty of time to decide.	Yɛwɔ bere pii a yɛde besi ho gyinae.
I think he's headed to school	Misusuw sɛ ɔde n’ani kyerɛ sukuu no
But that’s the problem.	Nanso ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
That was part of the plan.	Ná ɛno yɛ nhyehyɛe no fã.
It has its problems.	Ɛwɔ ɔhaw ahorow.
I was independent of the police	Ná mede me ho afi polisifo ho
And yet, it matters.	Na nanso, ɛho hia.
Just a little bit .	Kakraa bi kɛkɛ .
I didn’t just hand them over to him	Ɛnyɛ sɛ mede wɔn hyɛɛ ne nsa kɛkɛ
I can’t tell if he knows	Mintumi nhu sɛ onim anaa
I was there once too	Ná me nso mewɔ hɔ bere bi
Time to end the story.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wode asɛm no ba awiei.
I know tomorrow morning	Minim ɔkyena anɔpa
It feels amazing.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
He wanted to be the best he could be.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nea eye sen biara a obetumi ayɛ.
I walked into the house with them	Me ne wɔn nantew kɔɔ fie hɔ
I know what’s at stake	Minim nea ɛwɔ asɛm no mu
I loved it for the first few days	M’ani gyee ho wɔ nna kakraa a edi kan no mu
Or on the bus.	Anaasɛ wɔ bɔs mu.
I have no idea where	Minni baabi a wɔyɛ ho adwene biara
I know things are moving really fast	Minim sɛ nneɛma rekɔ so ntɛmntɛm ankasa
The same is true of the.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ.
It wasn't as if the child didn't matter to him.	Na ɛnyɛ te sɛ nea abofra no ho nhia no.
Maybe we’ll be happy.	Ebia yɛn ani begye.
A moment later, he was at the front door.	Bere tiaa bi akyi no, na ɔwɔ anim pon no ano.
I had known him for a long time	Ná minim no bere tenten
Everything you believe is wrong.	Biribiara a wugye di no yɛ bɔne.
It’s on me.	Ɛwɔ me so.
And you should do the same.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ saa.
I also really enjoyed the story.	M’ani gyee asɛm no ho nso ankasa.
I look forward to our next meeting	Mehwɛ yɛn nhyiam a edi hɔ no kwan
I told him that.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​saa.
At least that was the plan.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no.
His mother and father are there.	Ne maame ne ne papa wɔ hɔ.
But, I really want you	Nanso, mepɛ wo ampa
I think this was true	Misusuw sɛ na eyi yɛ nokware
I want to be happy.	Mepɛ sɛ m’ani gye.
There are many and new stories throughout.	Nsɛm pii ne foforo wɔ hɔ wɔ ne nyinaa mu.
I was none of those things	Ná menyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara
Usually, it doesn’t work out that way.	Mpɛn pii no, ɛnyɛ yiye saa.
It sounds a lot more painful than it is.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ yaw kɛse sen sɛnea ɛte no.
I have more information for them	Mewɔ nsɛm pii ma wɔn
I had to think about it	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho
I have a lot of things to do	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ
People feel it.	Nkurɔfo te nka.
I have my friends.	Mewɔ me nnamfo.
Not like that every summer.	Ɛnyɛ saa na awɔw bere biara.
We had a lot of financial problems.	Ná yɛwɔ sika ho haw pii.
Maybe a little big	Ebia na ɔyɛ kɛse kakra
Deal with it and move it.	Di ho dwuma na fa tu.
I couldn’t allow it	Na mintumi mma ho kwan
This is nothing new.	Eyi nyɛ ade foforo.
You don’t do that either.	Wo nso wonyɛ saa.
It was a house.	Ná ɛyɛ ofie bi.
I gave it to my mother.	Mede maa me maame.
I had control of the situation	Ná mewɔ tebea no so tumi
It’s not difficult enough.	Ɛnyɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ.
This is another problem.	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw foforo.
This was never the point.	Ná eyi nyɛ asɛm no da.
Trial.	Sɔhwɛ.
I always have a full house	Mewɔ ofie a ɛyɛ ma bere nyinaa
That takes a lot out of someone	Ɛno yi pii fi obi mu
He had to come to terms with his plan.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne ne nhyehyɛe no yɛ adwene.
But it’s just these songs.	Nanso ɛyɛ nnwom yi ara kwa.
It’s very simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Or just look at me.	Anaasɛ hwɛ me nkutoo.
However, they have all come along way.	Nanso, wɔn nyinaa aba kwan so.
I had no such time to say	Ná minni bere a ɛte saa a mede bɛka
I want to come with you	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo ba
It was an expensive job, and it was a lot of work.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma a ne bo yɛ den, na na ɛyɛ adwuma pii.
I have to say, the stay was just amazing.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ, na tra no yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
I know it sounds too simple but that is the plan	Minim sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo nanso ɛno ne nhyehyɛe no
I could have anyone else at that school	Ná metumi anya obi foforo biara wɔ saa sukuu no mu
Maybe another day, maybe another size.	Ebia da foforo, ebia kɛse foforo.
I thought that was you	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno ne wo
A girl could get used to this	Ná abeawa bi betumi ayɛ eyi ho su
He did for the table.	Ɔyɛɛ maa pon no.
I hope he gets better	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ne ho bɛtɔ no
I couldn’t prove anything to the police	Na mintumi nkyerɛ sɛ biribiara nkyerɛ polisifo
It’s still a little weird.	Ɛda so ara yɛ nwonwa kakra.
Of this we all agree.	Eyi ho no yɛn nyinaa gye tom.
He seemed to have .	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔwɔ .
Suppose this was not the case.	Fa no sɛ na eyi nte saa.
I want to say something	Mepɛ sɛ meka biribi
I didn’t want this for you	Na mempɛ eyi mma wo
But for this reason, no one knows the story.	Nanso eyi nti, obiara nnim asɛm no.
That is really something else entirely.	Ɛno yɛ biribi foforo koraa ampa.
I really couldn’t tell you why	Ankasa na mintumi nka nea enti a ɛte saa nkyerɛ wo
We all started out the same.	Yɛn nyinaa fii ase yɛɛ pɛ.
Do a job you want to do.	Yɛ adwuma bi a wopɛ sɛ woyɛ.
You know how important this is.	Wunim sɛnea eyi ho hia no yiye.
I could use it.	Ná metumi de adi dwuma.
It’s the same thing.	Ɛte saa ara.
I can’t figure out what it is	Mintumi nhu nea ɛyɛ
I was a real thing	Ná meyɛ ade ankasa
There are a few factors at play here though.	Nneɛma kakraa bi wɔ hɔ a edi agoru wɔ ha de, nanso.
I like them too.	M’ani gye wɔn nso ho.
He made a face.	Ɔyɛɛ anim bi.
I am not fast enough.	Menyɛ ntɛmntɛm.
I have a wealth of information and resources available to you.	Mewɔ nsɛm ne nneɛma pii a ɛwɔ hɔ ma wo.
Please give me your help.	Mesrɛ mo, momma me mo mmoa.
There is not much left after that.	Nneɛma pii nni hɔ a aka wɔ ɛno akyi.
I felt it was kind of hard	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ den bi
He could have said that.	Anka obetumi aka saa.
As could your mother, obviously.	Sɛnea na wo maame betumi ayɛ no, ɛda adi sɛ.
I like the idea of ​​that	M’ani gye adwene a ɛwɔ saa asɛm no ho no ho
For more information, see here.	Sɛ wopɛ nsɛm pii a, hwɛ ha.
But for now, he seems like a good guy.	Nanso seesei de, ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ ɔbarima pa.
I hope you can find that one person to help you.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi anya saa onipa biako no a ɔbɛboa wo.
But that’s just the man he was.	Nanso ɛno ne ɔbarima a na ɔyɛ no ara kwa.
On dress shoes.	Wɔ ntade mpaboa so.
His power is amazing.	Ne tumi yɛ nwonwa.
I stayed there for two and a half years.	Mede mfe abien ne fã traa hɔ.
Most are pretty easy, but a few seem to be difficult.	Dodow no ara yɛ mmerɛw yiye, nanso ɛte sɛ nea kakraa bi yɛ den.
Both have also commented on this.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa nso aka eyi ho asɛm.
You touched them.	Wode wo nsa kaa wɔn.
Keep warm while you do the rest.	Ma wo ho nyɛ hyew bere a woreyɛ nea aka no.
I want to save you from your true self	Mepɛ sɛ migye wo fi wo ho ankasa mu
You’ve done it right.	Woayɛ no yiye.
This really bothered me.	Eyi haw me paa.
I spent a lot of time with them	Me ne wɔn traa hɔ bere pii
I can’t go any further.	Mintumi nkɔ akyiri bio.
But not much help.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mmoa pii.
He must also know everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ onim biribiara nso.
The night sounded interesting.	Anadwo no yɛɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
You may have done it right.	Ebia woayɛ no yiye.
I can be anyone you want me to be	Metumi ayɛ obiara a wopɛ sɛ meyɛ
But no one talks about people.	Nanso obiara nka nnipa ho asɛm.
Right outside there.	Wɔ abɔnten hɔ ara.
I run the school here.	Me na mehwɛ sukuu no so wɔ ha.
I had a moment.	Na mewɔ bere bi.
I own this side of the street	Me na mewɔ saa abɔnten yi fã yi
This is a great day.	Eyi yɛ da kɛse.
They are one in the same for me.	Wɔyɛ biako wɔ ade koro mu ma me.
I wish it was that easy for me	Me yam a anka ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw saa ama me
This is never the case in the present book.	Eyi nte saa da wɔ mprempren nhoma no mu.
That shouldn’t be that hard.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno yɛ den saa.
I need to see him today	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no nnɛ
It was a wonderful job and a wonderful stay.	Ná ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ nwonwa ne bere a ɛyɛ nwonwa a wɔde tra hɔ.
It’s a great game.	Ɛyɛ agoru kɛse bi.
I can’t imagine being incredibly impressed with him	Mintumi nsusuw ho sɛ m’ani agye ne ho wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so
But there was no one there.	Nanso na obiara nni hɔ.
Not even the name.	Ɛnyɛ din no mpo.
There are more people than jobs.	Nnipa pii wɔ hɔ sen nnwuma.
The idea for this film comes from that.	Adwene a ɛwɔ sini yi ho no fi saa kwan no so.
It’s not a new thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade foforo.
He is a perfect boy.	Ɔyɛ abarimaa a ɔyɛ pɛ.
But that is not the case here.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte wɔ ha.
Every time you do it, it feels like the first time.	Bere biara a wobɛyɛ no, ɛte sɛ nea edi kan.
I couldn’t believe how complicated the issue had become	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛnea asɛm no ayɛ den no
We are involved in it.	Yɛde ne ho hyɛ mu.
You know where your child is.	Wunim baabi a wo ba no wɔ.
Like there is no house.	Te sɛ ofie biara nni hɔ.
That shouldn’t matter.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno ho hia.
So many things to consider	Enti nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho
I just felt a little better	Me ho tɔɔ me kakra kɛkɛ
I already have plans	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow dedaw
I also like the look of the table front.	M’ani gye sɛnea pon no anim no nso ho.
Hardly what he had planned to get into.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ nea na wayɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ ɔbɛkɔ mu no.
He set a time limit and that was that.	Ɔde bere bi sii hɔ na ɛno ne no.
I knew all about that one too	Ná minim saa biako no nyinaa nso
I have a wonderful idea	Mewɔ adwene bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa
But this is completely wrong.	Nanso eyi yɛ mfomso koraa.
And part of me wants it to still be.	Na me fã bi pɛ sɛ ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
A more dangerous approach.	Ɔkwan a ɛyɛ hu kɛse.
It was so beautiful and .	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ yiye na na .
My father went again.	Me papa kɔɔ bio.
I don’t want to hear new stories	Mempɛ sɛ mete nsɛm foforo
They didn’t have to work.	Na enhia sɛ wɔyɛ adwuma.
I don’t want to go any further than necessary	Mempɛ sɛ mekɔ akyiri sen sɛnea ɛho hia
You're the only one.	Wo ara ne wo.
Last night too.	Anadwo a etwaam no nso.
Go back to school.	San kɔ sukuu.
You don’t have to work.	Ɛho nhia sɛ woyɛ adwuma.
Everyone in town knows him.	Obiara a ɔwɔ kurow no mu nim no.
Live.	Te ase.
I couldn’t believe what happened a month ago	Ná mintumi nnye nea esii ɔsram biako a atwam ni no nni
This is a remarkable one.	Eyi yɛ nwonwa.
We all know this now.	Yɛn nyinaa nim eyi mprempren.
Just try and hit me.	Bɔ mmɔden na bɔ me kɛkɛ.
Take care of them.	Hwɛ wɔn yiye.
You are not a real person.	Wonyɛ obi ankasa.
No plans, yet.	Nhyehyɛe biara nni hɔ, de besi nnɛ.
I wish he could somehow see her in my mind	Me yam a anka ɔkwan bi so no obetumi ahu no wɔ m’adwene mu
Most of it seemed so unreal to him.	Dodow no ara na ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ nokware koraa mma no.
I can’t tell you.	Mintumi nka nkyerɛ wo.
I couldn’t love myself	Na mintumi mpɛ me ho
I have nothing wrong with them.	Minni bɔne biara wɔ wɔn ho.
I really like him as a person	M’ani gye ne ho ankasa sɛ onipa
He squinted at himself.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ne ho.
I love going outside	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛkɔ abɔnten
I thought it was the same.	Ná misusuw sɛ ɛte saa ara.
But he doesn’t like that.	Nanso n’ani nnye ho saa.
That is not new to us.	Ɛno nyɛ ade foforo mma yɛn.
That was a test.	Ná ɛno yɛ sɔhwɛ.
Give information before hand.	Fa nsɛm ma ansa na wode nsa ama.
I wouldn’t want to do that.	Anka mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
He knows more than we do.	Onim pii sen yɛn.
But only one comment.	Nanso asɛm biako pɛ a wɔka.
I want to keep doing that now.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ saa mprempren.
I had no friends there	Ná minni nnamfo biara wɔ hɔ
There is no such thing as a 'story'.	'Asɛm' biara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
It’s what the people would say.	Ɛyɛ nea na nkurɔfo no bɛka.
I still can’t figure out why you want to do this.	Me da so ara ntumi nhu nea enti a wopɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi.
I have a problem.	Mewɔ ɔhaw bi.
His father and I had a big argument about it.	Me ne ne papa gyee akyinnye kɛse wɔ ho.
Which was good for me.	Nea na eye ma me.
Different things will go into it.	Nneɛma ahorow bɛkɔ mu.
I might do that tomorrow	Ebia mɛyɛ saa ɔkyena
It only works the first time.	Ɛyɛ adwuma nea edi kan nkutoo.
I don’t know how it will work out yet	Minnim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye de besi nnɛ
Hopefully we can do it again soon.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ yebetumi ayɛ bio nnansa yi ara.
Time in years.	Bere wɔ mfe mu.
I reach back	Mede me nsa san kɔ akyi
He has no power.	Onni tumi biara.
The problems are real.	Ɔhaw ahorow no yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
There is no reason to risk your life with them.	Biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo nkwa to asiane mu wɔ wɔn ho.
A man who has to control himself.	Ɔbarima a ɛsɛ sɛ odi ne ho so.
So, assume he has one.	Enti, fa no sɛ ɔwɔ bi.
I am like another fresh fresh animal	Mete sɛ aboa foforo a ɔyɛ foforo a ɔyɛ foforo
I felt that you were there	Metee nka sɛ wowɔ hɔ
I went to dinner with a couple of people	Me ne nnipa baanu bi kɔɔ anwummere aduan
He was alone, like before.	Ná ɔno nkutoo wɔ hɔ, te sɛ kan no.
People just do things.	Nkurɔfo yɛ nneɛma kɛkɛ.
I saw you years ago.	Mihuu wo mfe bi a atwam ni.
I just want to be normal	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ obi a ɔte ase ara kwa
We are in it.	Yɛwɔ mu.
I want to get to know him better	Mepɛ sɛ mihu no yiye
He had to act quickly.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ho biribi ntɛm.
My last chance.	Me hokwan a etwa to.
I will bring the rest tomorrow	Mede nea aka no bɛba ɔkyena
I can’t hear the car anymore	Mintumi nte kar no bio
There is no timetable.	Bere nhyehyɛe biara nni hɔ.
But the man was much stronger.	Nanso na ɔbarima no ho yɛ den sen no koraa.
You were a bigger man than I was.	Ná woyɛ ɔbarima kɛse sen me.
He wants to succeed.	Ɔpɛ sɛ odi yiye.
I'm sure someone else has used it.	Migye di sɛ obi foforo de adi dwuma.
I was surprised at how easy it was	Sɛnea na ɛyɛ mmerɛw no yɛɛ me nwonwa
I think that was a good idea	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno yɛ adwene pa
But keep it simple, and know what you can handle.	Nanso ma ɛnyɛ mmerɛw, na hu nea wubetumi adi ho dwuma.
You are about the size.	Woyɛ bɛyɛ ne kɛse.
They work very well.	Wɔyɛ adwuma yiye paa.
Aside from that, it doesn’t seem great.	Sɛ yɛde ɛno to nkyɛn a, ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ kɛse.
It was a bit much.	Ná ɛyɛ pii kakra.
At least he knew what it was.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na onim nea ɛyɛ.
Never forget that.	Mma w’ani mfi saa asɛm no so da.
Which, by the way, he was doing.	Nea, ɔkwan bi so no, na ɔreyɛ.
I have so much to be thankful for.	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meda ase wɔ ho.
That’s nothing to worry about.	Ɛno nyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔde haw ne ho.
I will add it to mine.	Me nso mede bɛka me de ho.
I know what we will do tomorrow	Minim nea yɛbɛyɛ ɔkyena
More on that later.	Ɛno ho pii akyiri yi.
I have to admit and hope.	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye tom na mewɔ anidaso.
He knows that's an old story now.	Onim sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm dedaw mprempren.
It’s right here, and he does have something on it.	Ɛwɔ ha yi ara, na ɔwɔ biribi wɔ so ampa.
I have to say it that way	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka no saa
He glanced down and leaned closer.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ fam na ɔde ne ho too fam bɛn.
The mind is very powerful.	Adwene no wɔ tumi kɛse.
It was placed in its old way.	Wɔde sii ne kwan dedaw no so.
I love a good ending.	M’ani gye awiei pa ho.
I only headed this time	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ saa bere yi nkutoo
I think most people feel the same way	Misusuw sɛ nnipa dodow no ara te nka saa ara
It has a lot of appeal to it.	Ɛwɔ anigye pii wɔ ho.
There is absolutely no reason for this to happen.	Biribiara nni hɔ koraa a enti ɛsɛ sɛ eyi ba.
I want to know what happened last year	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea esii wɔ afe a etwaam no mu
I knew why, too much had happened	Ná minim nea enti a, na nneɛma pii asi dodo
I also love early evening time	M’ani gye anwummere ntɛm bere nso ho
What is the.	Dɛn ne...
But it wasn’t a joke.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ agoru.
I wonder who lives there now	Misusuw sɛ hena na ɔte hɔ mprempren
The way things are.	Sɛnea nneɛma te.
The one with the same name as yours.	Nea na ɔwɔ din koro no ara ne wo de no.
The road is in good condition.	Ɔkwan no wɔ tebea pa mu.
I felt great again.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ kɛse bio.
This bed is huge.	Saa mpa yi yɛ kɛse.
He would have done the same.	Anka ɔno nso bɛyɛ saa ara.
Or anyone, really.	Anaasɛ obiara, ampa.
And yet here it is.	Na nanso ɛwɔ ha.
I think he has an idea there	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ adwene bi wɔ hɔ
This will be important later.	Eyi bɛyɛ nea ɛho hia akyiri yi.
I heard my name many times.	Metee me din mpɛn pii.
You are one of them	Woyɛ wɔn mu biako
I didn’t have to make music anymore	Ná enhia sɛ meyɛ nnwom bio
I didn’t know anything in school either	Ná minnim hwee wɔ sukuu mu nso
I could fill in the rest	Ná metumi ahyɛ nea aka no ma
There were no people there.	Ná nnipa biara nni hɔ.
I can’t do that	Mintumi nyɛ saa
He was with me.	Ná ɔne me wɔ hɔ.
The information is not available.	Nsɛm a ɛwɔ hɔ no nni hɔ.
I need to sleep now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda mprempren.
I loved it the first time I saw it	Ná m’ani gye ho bere a edi kan a mihuu no no
I felt it was what he had to do	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ
There will be a tomorrow.	Ɔkyena bi bɛba.
He knew too much.	Ná onim nneɛma pii dodo.
I don’t want anyone else to be in that situation	Mempɛ sɛ obi foforo bɛba saa tebea no mu
None of them have any money.	Wɔn mu biara nni sika biara.
I can go on if you like	Metumi akɔ so sɛ wopɛ a
I couldn’t do that to him.	Na mintumi nyɛ no saa.
But that’s my real mom.	Nanso ɛno ne me maame ankasa.
Maybe it’s just me.	Ebia ɛyɛ me nkutoo.
Everything was perfect.	Ná biribiara yɛ pɛ.
He knew nothing about them.	Ná onnim wɔn ho hwee.
If only he was with me now.	Sɛ na ɔka me ho mprempren a.
And there was a father.	Na papa nso wɔ hɔ.
It was good that I did	Ná ɛyɛ papa sɛ meyɛ saa
I think you envy those two	Misusuw sɛ w’ani bere saa baanu no
If it is for some reason.	Sɛ ɛyɛ biribi nti a.
The current situation should work in a similar way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mprempren tebea no yɛ adwuma wɔ ɔkwan a ɛte saa ara so.
I think that affects a couple of things.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ka nneɛma abien bi.
But he had to say it.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka.
Not his gun.	Ɛnyɛ ne tuo no.
Beautiful and dangerous.	Ɛyɛ fɛ na asiane wom.
And he knows my name.	Na onim me din.
More importantly, the target vehicle is critical.	Nea ɛho hia sen saa no, kar a wɔde wɔn ani asi so no ho hia kɛse.
You are also faithful to me.	Wo nso di nokware ma me.
I just can’t understand any of it	Mintumi nte ase biara kɛkɛ
Immediately, they connected.	Ntɛm ara, wɔde wɔn ho bɔɔ wɔn ho.
I still had no children	Ná meda so ara nni ba
That is absolutely true.	Ɛno yɛ nokware ankasa.
He leaned against the table.	Ɔde ne ho too pon no so.
I know we can win this year	Minim sɛ yebetumi adi nkonim afe yi
Nothing hurts anymore.	Biribiara nyɛ yaw bio.
That’s what happened on the surface.	Ɛno ne nea esii wɔ ani so.
I think we both have something in common	Misusuw sɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa wɔ biribi a ɛyɛ pɛ
Many people worked with him.	Nnipa pii ne no yɛɛ adwuma.
I’ll be happy to follow up with more information	M’ani begye sɛ mede nsɛm pii bedi akyi
I'll give it to you.	Me ma wo.
You can’t tell how many there are.	Worentumi nhu dodow a ɛwɔ hɔ.
I never should have done that	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa da
I had a dog a very long time ago	Na mewɔ kraman bere tenten paa a atwam ni
I believed it existed not long ago	Ná migye di sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ bere tiaa bi a atwam ni
That’s a house.	Ɛno yɛ ofie.
I was there for them	Ná mewɔ hɔ ma wɔn
I could almost taste them	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na metumi aka wɔn ahwɛ
You really have to think about the time you are given.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw bere a wɔde ama wo no ho ankasa.
I still admire the man as he was	M’ani da so ara ani gye ɔbarima no ho sɛnea na ɔyɛ
I didn’t want to do anything with it anymore	Ná mempɛ sɛ mede biribi bɛyɛ bio
Either that or better is just not good enough.	Ɛno anaa nea eye sen biara no nyɛ papa kɛkɛ.
But it seems to me, not a good way.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ me sɛ, ɛnyɛ ɔkwan pa.
I think that could be a mistake.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno betumi ayɛ mfomso.
Someone has to take it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi fa.
The perfect man was a completely free man.	Ná onipa a ɔyɛ pɛ no yɛ onipa a ɔde ne ho koraa.
He wants the best.	Ɔpɛ nea eye sen biara.
Make it work.	Ma ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I was looking forward to going home	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ mɛkɔ fie
I can’t do all this alone	Me nkutoo ntumi nyɛ eyi nyinaa
But, I just want it done	Nanso, mepɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no ara kwa
You should do the same.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ saa.
He loves those books.	N’ani gye saa nhoma ahorow no ho yiye.
I wrapped my arms around her	Mede me nsa bɔɔ ne mu
He took them outside.	Ɔde wɔn fii adi.
Or maybe that was his legs.	Anaasɛ ebia na ɛno ne ne nan.
You know products and products.	Wunim nneɛma a wɔyɛ ne nneɛma a wɔyɛ.
I keep walking in that direction	Mekɔ so nantew kɔ saa kwan no so
I simply just couldn’t process what that meant anymore	Na mintumi nyɛ nea ɛno kyerɛ ho adwuma bio kɛkɛ kɛkɛ
I just have one more thing to say	Mewɔ asɛm biako bio a mɛka kɛkɛ
I love everything about the phone except the carrier	M’ani gye telefon no ho biribiara ho gye nea wɔde fa telefon no nkutoo
The same thing happened the next day.	Saa ara nso na ɛda a edi hɔ no.
A big problem.	Ɔhaw kɛse.
This means you can use it for other purposes.	Eyi kyerɛ sɛ wubetumi de ayɛ nneɛma foforo.
I knew you would make something of yourself	Na minim sɛ wobɛyɛ biribi afi wo ho
They were bright.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ hyew.
I loved my time with him	Ná m’ani gye bere a na me ne no wɔ no ho
I thought time was important to him	Misusuwii sɛ bere ho hia no
I had to do something about it	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ho biribi
It was completely untrue.	Ná ɛnyɛ nokware koraa.
He will use you in a big way.	Ɔde wo bedi dwuma wɔ ɔkwan kɛse so.
I can't let this go down	Mintumi mma eyi nkɔ fam
I have to, you know that	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa, wunim saa
You probably already have that table.	Ebia wowɔ saa pon no dedaw.
And that’s how things started.	Na saa na nneɛma fii ase.
You just have to remember two things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wokae nneɛma abien kɛkɛ.
But you never know for sure.	Nanso wunnim no yiye da.
I understand how everything works.	Mete sɛnea biribiara yɛ adwuma no ase.
But he knew he had to tell her.	Nanso na onim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ no.
I know you save my son	Minim sɛ wugye me ba nkwa
At least someone heard about them.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, obi tee wɔn ho asɛm.
I also hear a lot of stories along the way	Mete nsɛm pii nso wɔ kwan so
You say you want to be a bigger person.	Woka sɛ wopɛ sɛ woyɛ onipa kɛse.
I thought that was a great idea	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno yɛ adwene kɛse
He never does that.	Ɔnyɛ saa da.
But that is part of the story.	Nanso ɛno ka asɛm no ho.
I had a few things to do	Ná mewɔ nneɛma kakraa bi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ
I could have told him anything	Anka metumi aka biribiara akyerɛ no
But there is really nothing in them.	Nanso biribiara nni wɔn mu ankasa.
I didn't even know if there was such a thing	Ná minnim mpo sɛ ebia biribi a ɛte saa wɔ hɔ anaa
If this is you, I was very impressed with your mother.	Sɛ eyi ne wo a, m’ani gyee wo maame ho yiye.
I was the one who did it	Me na meyɛɛ saa
This happened every evening throughout the year.	Eyi sii anwummere biara wɔ afe mũ no nyinaa mu.
They are the providers.	Wɔn ne wɔn a wɔde ama.
But there was one other apparent target.	Nanso na ade foforo biako wɔ hɔ a ɛda adi sɛ wɔde wɔn ani asi so.
I just want to talk to him	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa kɛkɛ
I do what is necessary.	Meyɛ nea ɛho hia no.
He really didn’t know what to do.	Ankasa na onnim nea ɔnyɛ.
But it doesn’t work.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma.
His fear is real	Ne hu no yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa
And no one like this ever.	Na obiara a ɔte sɛ eyi da.
She knew he wanted more from her.	Ná onim sɛ ɔpɛ pii fi ne hɔ.
I invest just as much in this as you do	Mede sika pii hyɛ eyi mu te sɛ mo ara pɛ
The one-sided image is shown to people.	Wɔde mfonini a ɛwɔ anim biako no kyerɛ nkurɔfo.
See what you like.	Hwɛ nea w’ani gye ho.
I could still feel him	Ná meda so ara tumi te ne nka
I know so many final stories	Minim nsɛm a etwa to pii saa
I could never forget about you	Ná me werɛ ntumi mfi wo ho asɛm da
He was one of those people.	Ná ɔyɛ saa nnipa no mu biako.
But it’s not anymore.	Nanso ɛnyɛ bio.
I was no longer a child.	Ná menyɛ abofra bio.
This had seemed like a lifetime commitment.	Ná eyi ayɛ te sɛ nea wɔde wɔn nkwa nna nyinaa bɛma.
And that could be the case.	Na ɛno betumi ayɛ saa.
I can come there.	Metumi aba hɔ.
I put my hand on his	Mede me nsa too ne de no so
He is the one who is.	Ɔno ne obi a ɔte saa.
However, it shouldn’t be.	Nanso, ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
But this is most likely not the case.	Nanso ɛda adi kɛse sɛ eyi nte saa.
I was still here and alone	Ná meda so ara wɔ ha na na me nkutoo
But that doesn’t mean he can.	Nanso ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ obetumi.
I need to know everything	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu biribiara
It was easy, really.	Ná ɛyɛ mmerɛw, ampa.
Glad you are doing well now.	Anigye sɛ woreyɛ yiye mprempren.
I hope our day goes well	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ yɛn da no bɛyɛ yiye
I didn’t want to get in trouble	Ná mempɛ sɛ mekɔ ɔhaw mu
He wants to	Ɔpɛ sɛ .
I hear you were very interested in that	Mete sɛ na w’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho kɛse
I want to get to know you better	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wo yiye
Don’t let it be a lie.	Mma ɛnyɛ atoro.
I wanted to tell him more	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka nneɛma pii kyerɛ no
I have no desire to be one	Minni ɔpɛ biara sɛ mɛyɛ biako
A is true in this situation	A yɛ nokware wɔ tebea yi mu
Everything we rely on went.	Biribiara a yɛde yɛn ho to so no kɔɔ so.
I felt vulnerable to his temptation	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ mmerɛw wɔ ne sɔhwɛ mu
I don’t know how it works, really	Minnim sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma, ampa
I have a house here.	Mewɔ ofie wɔ ha.
When it was mine, there was no one left.	Bere a ɛyɛ me de no, na obiara nni hɔ bio.
This needs to continue.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi kɔ so.
I accept what has happened.	Migye nea asi no tom.
I just have great them and our first and worst	Me kɛkɛ wɔ kɛse wɔn na yɛn kan ne bɔne sen biara
I didn’t know what he wanted	Ná minnim nea ɔpɛ
He didn't know where he was.	Ná onnim baabi a ɔwɔ.
Take their word for the latter.	Fa wɔn asɛm no ɛyɛ nea etwa to no.
I have the best job ever	Mewɔ adwuma a eye sen biara a meyɛ pɛn
He wants us to sin.	Ɔpɛ sɛ yɛyɛ bɔne.
I should have known that	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu saa
I expect that it is.	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɛte saa.
All materials used will be the same.	Nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma nyinaa bɛyɛ pɛ.
This weekend is a different story.	Saa dapɛn awiei yi yɛ asɛm foforo.
If you give him to me, I will do anything	Sɛ wode no ma me a, mɛyɛ biribiara
He was a very interesting child and always told stories.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra a n’ani gye ho kɛse na ɔka nsɛm bere nyinaa.
I knew what he wanted.	Ná minim nea ɔpɛ.
It’s very simple and you can do that here.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye na wubetumi ayɛ saa wɔ ha.
They are very interested in me	Wɔn ani gye me ho kɛse
If you find it, use it.	Sɛ wuhu a, fa di dwuma.
It was just a skull.	Ná ɛyɛ ti nhwi ara kwa.
It’s a thrill.	Ɛyɛ anigye.
I know when something went wrong	Minim bere a biribi anyɛ yiye
We are the ones who have it.	Yɛn na yɛwɔ.
I think we can handle it	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi adi ho dwuma
It’s scary but that’s how it is.	Ɛyɛ hu nanso saa na ɛte.
Everyone was shocked.	Obiara ho dwiriw no.
Don't touch me.	Mfa wo nsa nka me.
He was terribly handsome.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ a ɛyɛ hu.
We would really appreciate your help!.	Yɛn ani begye wo mmoa ho ankasa!.
The song is the first	Dwom no na edi kan
And you just can’t do that.	Na worentumi nyɛ saa kɛkɛ.
I don’t know how to do it	Minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ
I like the latter very well	M’ani gye nea etwa to yi ho yiye paa
Very great power.	Tumi kɛse paa.
Like my father here.	Te sɛ me papa wɔ ha.
It’s not a problem.	Ɛnyɛ ɔhaw.
I am a good planner.	Meyɛ nhyehyɛe pa.
I have the pictures somewhere.	Mewɔ mfonini ahorow no wɔ baabi.
I know what has happened	Minim nea akɔ so
This is what I have so far.	Eyi ne nea mewɔ de besi nnɛ.
I pretend he is not in the room though	Meyɛ me ho sɛ onni dan no mu nanso
I love being out here	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ abɔnten ha
I wanted to do more	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ade pii
Do this all the time.	Yɛ eyi bere nyinaa.
I didn't know how long we stayed like that	Ná minnim bere tenten a yɛde tra hɔ saa
At the time I didn’t know what it was	Saa bere no na minnim nea ɛyɛ
I don’t think it’s going to be that much more complicated.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den kɛse saa.
Let someone know what you are doing.	Ma obi nhu nea woreyɛ.
That is for life.	Ɛno yɛ ma nkwa.
There was one condition.	Ná tebea biako wɔ hɔ.
I just wanted to know about one thing	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu ade biako ho asɛm kɛkɛ
When is this the case.	Bere bɛn na eyi te saa.
I heard the music too	Me nso metee nnwom no
It might be as soon as next month.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ ɔsram a edi hɔ no ara pɛ.
I used it all the time	Ná mede di dwuma bere nyinaa
It seems so hard for him.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den ma no saa.
Maybe just the two of you.	Ebia mo baanu nkutoo.
I couldn’t believe it	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɛyɛ nokware
They both turned to the door.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa dan kɔɔ ɔpon no ano.
But we shouldn’t be doing that.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
I think we liked the same people	Misusuw sɛ na yɛn ani gye nnipa koro no ara ho
I thought you’d like to go with me	Misusuwii sɛ w’ani begye ho sɛ wo ne me bɛkɔ
Here is one that isn’t.	Biako a ɛnte saa ni.
I think there is something wrong with his head	Misusuw sɛ biribi bɔne bi wɔ ne ti so
I don’t always look like this	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na me ho te sɛ eyi
However, two things are clear enough.	Nanso, nneɛma abien bi mu da hɔ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Most agree.	Dodow no ara gye tom.
I never thought this was possible	Ná minsusuw ho da sɛ eyi betumi ayɛ yiye
Not too dangerous for me.	Asiane kɛse nnim ma me.
I can’t really put it any other way.	Mintumi nkyerɛ no ɔkwan foforo biara so ankasa.
He was gone, there was no doubt about it.	Ná onni hɔ bio, na akyinnye biara nni ho.
Even if they did, it would be temporary at best.	Sɛ wɔyɛ saa mpo a, anka ɛbɛyɛ bere tiaa mu de wɔ nea eye sen biara mu.
There can be many attributes.	Su ahorow pii betumi aba hɔ.
Maybe it will work out.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
I'm just happy, really	Meyɛ anigye ara kwa, ampa
Show me, boy.	Kyerɛ me, abarimaa.
You have to put it out there doing things.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wode to hɔ reyɛ nneɛma.
And that’s what it is.	Na ɛno ne saa.
I know how it all works	Minim sɛnea ne nyinaa yɛ adwuma
I still do that.	Meda so ara yɛ saa.
I can take you there, if you like	Metumi de wo akɔ hɔ, sɛ wopɛ a
I just nodded my head.	Mede me ti too fam kɛkɛ.
It was difficult.	Ná ɛyɛ den.
He sits on the edge of your bed.	Ɔte wo mpa no ano.
We cannot thank them enough for what they did for us.	Yɛrentumi nna wɔn ase sɛnea ɛsɛ wɔ nea wɔyɛ maa yɛn no ho.
I just wasn’t happy.	Ná m’ani nnye kɛkɛ.
But he could have done that.	Nanso anka obetumi ayɛ saa.
He’s a great guy.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima kɛse.
I was always in pain	Ná me ho ayɛ me yaw bere nyinaa
I know what’s going on now	Minim nea ɛrekɔ so mprempren
I had it all planned out	Ná mewɔ ne nyinaa ho nhyehyɛe
You know how he could be.	Wunim sɛnea na obetumi ayɛ.
Mother was a.	Ná Maame yɛ.
I can barely control it with good food	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi mfa aduan pa nni so
You’re not him.	Wonyɛ ɔno.
I am with you, and you are with me.	Meka mo ho, na mo nso meka me ho.
A strange and wonderful thing	Ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa na ɛyɛ nwonwa
I think you've forgotten that	Misusuw sɛ wo werɛ afi saa
And it was a pleasure.	Na ɛyɛ anigye.
Might.	Ebia.
I find it a wonderful thing	Mihu sɛ ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa
I can’t imagine who would do such a thing	Mintumi nsusuw ho sɛ hena na ɔbɛyɛ ade a ɛte saa
Anyway, stay there.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, tra hɔ.
I told him to take control of my current situation	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ onni tebea a mewɔ mprempren no so
I know where my mind is.	Minim baabi a m’adwene wɔ.
No beds or anything.	Mpa anaa biribiara nni hɔ.
I thought this would be, for sure	Misusuwii sɛ eyi bɛyɛ saa, akyinnye biara nni ho
He is a foreign language.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ kasa foforo.
After this.	Eyi akyi no.
At least for a while.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, bere tiaa bi.
His head fell back against mine.	Ne ti san hwee me de no so.
I had to give him that	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede saa asɛm no ma no
This is his most important day.	Eyi ne ne da a ɛho hia sen biara.
I need to put it down and go to sleep	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede to fam na meda
He spent the rest of his years there	Ɔde ne mfe a aka no traa hɔ
You don’t even have to talk to me.	Ɛho nhia mpo sɛ wo ne me kasa.
So here so far are the results of this project.	Enti ha de besi ha na nea afi saa adwuma yi mu aba no wɔ.
I have to say I can manage it	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ me tumi di so
But maybe just knowing was hard for him.	Nanso ebia na minim a minim ara kwa no yɛ den ma no.
I don’t know if this will make you happy.	Minnim sɛ ebia eyi bɛma w’ani agye anaa.
I understand that you want to have sex	Mete ase sɛ wopɛ sɛ wo ne obi da
I can’t say much more now	Mintumi nka pii bio mprempren
My mom had the same hairstyle.	Ná me maame nso wɔ ti nhwi koro no ara.
It’s good though.	Ɛyɛ papa nanso.
This is something these people believe.	Eyi yɛ biribi a saa nkurɔfo yi gye di.
I didn’t know how to be a man	Na minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ ɔbarima
Or the pain of it.	Anaasɛ ne yaw no.
I own them both.	Me na mewɔ wɔn baanu nyinaa.
You know whatever it is.	Wunim nea ɛte biara.
Part of me was jealous of her	Ná me fã bi ani bere no
I could use a party.	Ná metumi de apontow bi adi dwuma.
They are powerful.	Wɔyɛ tumi.
I would spend hours looking at it.	Ná mede nnɔnhwerew pii hwɛ mu.
This song has everything.	Saa dwom yi wɔ biribiara.
That day.	Saa da no.
It’s his money.	Ɛyɛ ne sika.
A week later.	Dapɛn biako akyi.
I didn’t even have to work much	Ná enhia sɛ meyɛ adwuma pii mpo
Last night was awful.	Anadwo a etwaam no yɛɛ hu.
But this time, nothing happens.	Nanso saa bere yi de, biribiara mma.
No one is telling.	Obiara nkyerɛ.
I'll give you more some other time.	Mede pii bɛma wo bere foforo bi.
It has something for everyone and every age.	Ɛwɔ biribi ma obiara ne mfe biara.
We can make arrangements.	Yebetumi ayɛ nhyehyɛe.
But they were not good days.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ nna pa.
Take care really long and hard look.	Hwɛ yiye ankasa tenten ne den hwɛ.
It seemed to be the same.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa ara.
I know how hard it must be for you	Minim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ den ama wo
I wonder what his plans are with that painting.	Misusuw sɛ dɛn ne ne nhyehyɛe ahorow wɔ saa mfonini no ho.
Many people seem to think so	Ɛte sɛ nea nnipa pii susuw saa
Part of me knew he wanted that too	Na me fã bi nim sɛ ɔno nso pɛ saa
There must be a reason.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
He knew he didn’t have long.	Ná onim sɛ onni bere tenten.
I only have other projects to do now	Mewɔ nnwuma foforo nkutoo a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ mprempren
That might as well work out.	Ebia ɛno nso bɛyɛ yiye saa ara.
Just to be completely vulnerable.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ na woayɛ mmerɛw koraa kɛkɛ.
I could not understand what had happened or why.	Ná mintumi nte nea asi anaa nea enti a asi no ase.
Maybe someone else will play that.	Ebia obi foforo bɛbɔ saa asɛm no.
I have to go to work.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ adwuma.
His presence saved her life, at least in the moment.	Ne ba a ɔwɔ hɔ no gyee ne nkwa, anyɛ yiye koraa no saa bere no ara.
I think that would be amazing	Misusuw sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ nwonwa
I have a few to tell you	Kakraa bi na mewɔ a mɛka akyerɛ wo
And those people have actually seen it.	Na saa nkurɔfo no ahu ankasa.
It’s what the movie is about.	Ɛyɛ nea sini no fa ho.
I only know what you know.	Nea wunim nkutoo na minim.
How will he help me? 	Ɔbɛyɛ dɛn aboa me?
Do something wrong.	Yɛ biribi bɔne.
I might just refer you to that	Ebia mede wo bɛkɔ saa asɛm no ho ara kwa
I have from my mother	Mewɔ fi me maame hɔ
I want to know what he's doing out there	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea ɔreyɛ wɔ abɔnten hɔ
We had to do this ourselves.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn ankasa yɛ eyi.
It’s just enough.	Ɛdɔɔso ara kwa.
I want you to do whatever you want to do	Mepɛ sɛ woyɛ nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ biara
I am the only one who says where it is.	Me nkutoo na ɔka baabi a ɛwɔ.
I am well aware of all this	Minim eyi nyinaa yiye
This is not an easy task.	Eyi nyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
So that can happen.	Enti ɛno betumi aba.
It’s only temporary.	Ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi pɛ.
I forget that most people are so wonderful	Me werɛ fi sɛ nnipa dodow no ara yɛ nwonwa yiye
But there were only half of them.	Nanso na wɔn mu fã pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I want it to be all of me	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ me nyinaa
I should have thought about it	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho
That wasn’t true either.	Ɛno nso anyɛ nokware.
Fun and playful most of the time.	Anigye ne agoru bere dodow no ara.
This will end tonight.	Eyi bɛba awiei anadwo yi.
He had something he didn’t have.	Ná ɔwɔ biribi a na onni bi.
That’s how they work.	Saa na wɔyɛ adwuma.
I did that, too.	Meyɛɛ saa nso.
That was his only hope.	Ná ɛno nkutoo ne anidaso a ɔwɔ.
A bed could come later and some food	Ná mpa betumi aba akyiri yi na aduan bi aba
Consider everything before you act, too.	Susuw biribiara ho ansa na woayɛ biribi, wo nso.
Not my house, not my house.	Ɛnyɛ me fie, ɛnyɛ me fie.
Much better than nothing.	Ɛyɛ papa kɛse sen sɛ biribiara nni hɔ.
That was really a very difficult task.	Na ɛno yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den yiye ankasa.
I am better than that	Meyɛ papa sen saa
It seemed flawless.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea mfomso biara nni ho.
Be a creative person.	Yɛ obi a ɔyɛ ade.
This is perfect.	Eyi yɛ pɛ.
As with any currency that.	Sɛnea ɛte wɔ sika biara ho sɛ.
Without him, he could have done more.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɔno a, anka obetumi ayɛ pii.
It’s all the same.	Ne nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
It’s the user.	Ɛyɛ nea ɔde di dwuma no.
This is a dangerous time for our people.	Eyi yɛ bere a asiane wom ma yɛn nkurɔfo.
He could handle real things.	Ná obetumi adi nneɛma ankasa ho dwuma.
I had better do that now.	Anka eye sɛ meyɛ saa mprempren.
You just worry about yourself.	Wo ho haw wo ho kɛkɛ.
So there are things that .	Enti nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a .
Maybe I still have that right.	Ebia meda so ara wɔ saa hokwan no.
I know what’s in store for me.	Minim nea ɛwɔ hɔ ma me.
I already knew the problem existed	Ná minim dedaw sɛ ɔhaw no wɔ hɔ
I really thought we could do that.	Misusuwii ankasa sɛ yebetumi ayɛ saa.
That’s great, it really is.	Ɛno yɛ kɛse, ɛte saa ampa.
I found it lying there wrapped in paper	Mihuu sɛ ɛda hɔ a wɔde krataa abɔ mu
It was a fascinating experience.	Ná ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye.
However, it wasn’t.	Nanso, na ɛnte saa.
I need to know what they do	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea wɔyɛ
I want to know the backstory	Mepɛ sɛ mihu akyi asɛm no
This is that ending.	Eyi ne saa awiei no.
It’s important to us, too.	Ɛho hia yɛn nso.
I just wanted to believe it	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye di ara kwa
I used to enjoy going with them	Kan no na m’ani gye ho sɛ me ne wɔn bɛkɔ
In that case, the temperature of the system was the same.	Wɔ saa tebea no mu no, na nhyehyɛe no mu hyew yɛ pɛ.
I need to be in a better movie than this	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ sini a eye sen eyi mu
I wrapped my arms around her	Mede me nsa bɔɔ ne mu
It was a terrifying thought	Ná ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ hu
But he knew it.	Nanso na onim.
First, prioritize each book anew.	Nea edi kan no, fa nhoma biara di kan foforo.
I still want to do a few things with you	Meda so ara pɛ sɛ me ne wo yɛ nneɛma kakraa bi
They are very interested in me.	Wɔn ani gye me ho kɛse.
This article provides a lot of information.	Saa asɛm yi de nsɛm pii ma.
I think it looks really nice now	Misusuw sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ ankasa mprempren
This is a remarkable thing.	Eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
A very rare quality these days.	Su bi a ɛho yɛ na yiye nnansa yi.
I give this statement for three or three more days.	Mede saa asɛm yi ma nnansa anaa nnansa bio.
After all, it is.	Wɔ ne nyinaa akyi no.
Some ideas of these projects will be used below.	Wɔde saa nnwuma yi ho adwene ahorow bi bedi dwuma wɔ ase ha.
Not that night, he knew.	Ɛnyɛ saa anadwo no, na onim.
I'm sure you see where this is going	Migye di sɛ wuhu baabi a eyi rekɔ
I guess there is nothing he can say	Misusuw sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi aka
I liked his easygoing nature	M’ani gyee ne su a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no ho
I didn’t even have to think about it	Ná enhia sɛ misusuw ho mpo
And he had to feel lucky.	Na na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔte nka sɛ ɔwɔ anigye.
I want to be more like them both	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ sɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa kɛse
But surely everyone knows that.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ obiara nim saa.
I have a busy schedule	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe a adagyew nnim
I was a huge dog in that one	Ná meyɛ ɔkraman kɛse bi wɔ saa biako no mu
It’s much easier.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
In most cases.	Mpɛn pii no.
I can’t seem to be weak	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nyɛ sɛ obi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw
It is no longer a part of me.	Ɛnyɛ me fã bio.
I just wanted it to be just me and me alone	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ me ne me nkutoo nkutoo
His plan was simple.	Ná ne nhyehyɛe no yɛ mmerɛw.
Again I just saw it.	Saa bere no nso mihuu no ara kwa.
It was very good for us.	Ná eye ma yɛn paa.
At that point the man could do no wrong.	Saa bere no na ɔbarima no antumi anyɛ bɔne biara.
I admired him for that	M’ani gyee ne ho wɔ saa asɛm no ho
He is a good man.	Ɔyɛ onipa pa.
I want you to have that dinner with me	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me di saa anwummere aduan no
My father taught me that your name is the most important thing.	Me papa kyerɛɛ me sɛ wo din ne ade a ɛho hia sen biara.
I didn’t want any of that	Ná mempɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara
There would be no happiness for him.	Anka anigye biara nni hɔ mma no.
The water gushed briefly.	Nsu no bɔɔ denneennen bere tiaa bi.
A mind and a thing is what we have.	Adwene ne ade bi ne nea yɛwɔ.
Let the plans do the work and let the people do the plans.	Ma nhyehyɛe ahorow no nyɛ adwuma no na nkurɔfo nso nyɛ nhyehyɛe ahorow no.
I realize how this doesn’t make me weak	Mihu sɛnea eyi mma menyɛ mmerɛw
None of this actually happened	Eyi mu biara amma ankasa
This is the most important thing.	Eyi ne ade a ɛho hia sen biara.
I think they were worse	Misusuw sɛ na wɔyɛ bɔne sen saa
That’s the hardest part.	Ɛno ne ade a ɛyɛ den sen biara.
However, it was difficult.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ den.
I'll come with you	Me ne wo bɛba
I couldn’t think of him now	Na mintumi nsusuw ne ho mprempren
Which was the same.	Nea na ɛte saa ara.
And the best boy.	Na abarimaa a ɔyɛ papa sen biara.
I guess he doesn't know you that well yet	Misusuw sɛ onnim wo yiye saa ara de besi nnɛ
It seemed interesting at the time.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye saa bere no.
It all has to come to this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ne nyinaa ba eyi so.
I don’t know what else to do.	Minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ bio.
I couldn’t even imagine what happened	Ná mintumi nsusuw nea esii no ho mpo
For me it was really easy.	Wɔ me fam no na ɛnyɛ den ankasa sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
He really liked that.	Ná n’ani gye saa asɛm no ho ankasa.
I was with you the whole time	Ná me ne wo wɔ hɔ bere no nyinaa
That’s the best we can do.	Ɛno ne nea eye sen biara a yebetumi ayɛ.
It was a problem of time.	Ná ɛyɛ bere ho haw.
I couldn’t go on without any of you	Na mintumi nkɔ so sɛ mo mu biara nka ho
I could not do this alone	Ná me nkutoo ntumi nyɛ eyi
I have work to attend to this evening	Mewɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ anwummere yi
I have more important things to post.	Mewɔ nneɛma a ɛho hia kɛse a ɛsɛ sɛ mede to hɔ.
I didn't know if he did or not	Ná minnim sɛ ebia ɔyɛ saa anaasɛ ɔnyɛ saa
Who is our own.	Hena na yɛn ankasa de.
I didn’t want to look at them	Ná mempɛ sɛ mehwɛ wɔn
I don’t know why that is.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
At every opportunity.	Wɔ hokwan biara a wɔde bɛma mu.
Either way, that’s awesome.	Ɔkwan biara so no, ɛno yɛ hu.
It was cold the whole time.	Ná awɔw wom bere no nyinaa.
The whole scene was strange.	Ná tebea no nyinaa yɛ nwonwa.
I know very little about him	Kakraa bi na minim ne ho
I handed him the money	Mede sika no hyɛɛ ne nsa
I know your every move before you make it	Minim wo tu biara ansa na woayɛ
I guess, if that’s what you want	Misusuw sɛ, sɛ ɛno ne nea wopɛ a
That was a terrible thing indeed.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu ampa.
But the next one was always ahead.	Nanso na nea edi hɔ no di anim bere nyinaa.
However, he can do it here.	Nanso, obetumi ayɛ wɔ ha.
I was young then, you know	Saa bere no na meyɛ abofra, wunim
At least I knew that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na minim saa.
Maybe even perfect.	Ebia ɛyɛ pɛ mpo.
What! 	Dɛn!
A little bit, anyway	Kakraa bi, sɛnea ɛte biara
I am fully present and in the moment	Mewɔ hɔ koraa na mewɔ mprempren mu
I just wanted this awful day to end	Ná mepɛ sɛ da a ɛyɛ hu yi ba awiei ara kwa
But for too many, it is.	Nanso wɔ nnipa pii dodo fam no, ɛte saa.
I should have done something	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi
I don’t forget that.	M’ani mfi saa asɛm no so.
I am sure he will do well.	Migye di sɛ ɔbɛyɛ yiye.
I’ll be happy with it.	M’ani begye ho.
My head doesn't hurt tonight.	Me ti nyɛ yaw anadwo yi.
I have this weird problem.	Mewɔ ɔhaw a ɛyɛ nwonwa yi.
She was so warm and perfect in every way.	Ná ne ho yɛ hyew yiye na na ɔyɛ pɛ wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
Stay here as long as you want.	Tra ha bere tenten biara a wopɛ.
I loved being a part of this	M’ani gyee ho sɛ mɛyɛ eyi fã
I had forgotten to speak again	Ná me werɛ afi kasa bio
There are good things right there.	Nneɛma pa wɔ hɔ ara.
Very true, too.	Nokware paa nso.
I loved painting it	M’ani gyee ho sɛ mɛyɛ ho mfonini
I wanted to know about them	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu wɔn ho asɛm
I love it anyway.	M’ani gye ho ɔkwan biara so.
Feeling that something is wrong	Te a obi te nka sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye
That was a little painful but very nice.	Ná ɛno yɛ yaw kakra nanso na ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I hear my name again.	Mete me din bio.
It sounds complicated but it’s not.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
I just think of the police	Misusuw polisifo no ho ara kwa
It was just too soon.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo ara kwa.
You need to take some time.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye bere kakra.
I have a different idea	Mewɔ adwene foforo
I take all my support there	Mede me mmoa nyinaa kɔ hɔ
Tonight it wasn’t his eyes.	Anadwo yi anyɛ n’ani.
I think he is good for her	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛ papa ma no
He is in school.	Ɔwɔ sukuu mu.
Besides, it’s nice to be there.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, ɛyɛ anigye sɛ obi wɔ hɔ.
It was more of the same.	Ná ɛyɛ ade koro no ara kɛse.
I'm sure it wasn't much at all.	Migye di sɛ na ɛnyɛ pii koraa.
Never talk to us about school again.	Wo ne yɛn nka sukuu ho asɛm bio da.
I think this is what happened	Misusuw sɛ eyi ne nea esii
I think we are good about giving things away	Misusuw sɛ yɛyɛ papa wɔ nneɛma a yɛde ma ho
My father's mouth.	Me papa ano.
And our cheap ones.	Na yɛn a ne bo nyɛ den no nso.
I think it will be something simple.	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ biribi a ɛnyɛ den.
He didn’t need to be here.	Na enhia sɛ ɔwɔ ha.
That’s pretty much what we have here.	Ɛno ne nea yɛwɔ wɔ ha no fã kɛse no ara.
I didn’t like him very much	Ná m’ani nnye ne ho kɛse
I love it and I’m sure you will	M’ani gye ho na migye di sɛ wobɛyɛ saa
I’ve been missing you for a while	M’ani agye wo ho kakra
The meeting must have ended.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ nhyiam no baa awiei.
But this is a recent development for us.	Nanso eyi yɛ ade a aba nnansa yi wɔ yɛn fam.
He knew where he was.	Ná onim baabi a ɔwɔ.
It was like that of an animal.	Ná ɛte sɛ aboa bi de.
Please and thank you.	Mesrɛ wo na meda wo ase.
He knew her well then.	Saa bere no na onim no yiye.
We are what we are.	Yɛn ne nea yɛyɛ.
The result is that	Nea afi mu aba ne sɛ .
That in itself was exciting.	Ná ɛno ankasa yɛ anigye.
I understand the concept	Mete adwene no ase
I had no idea how to run a business.	Ná minnim sɛnea mɛyɛ adwuma bi ho adwene biara.
I couldn’t save them	Na mintumi nnye wɔn nkwa
One team starts at that end, and the other team starts.	Kuw biako fi ase wɔ saa awiei no, na kuw foforo no nso fi ase.
But it’s only one part of our plan.	Nanso ɛyɛ yɛn nhyehyɛe no fã biako pɛ.
I touched it with my hand.	Mede me nsa kaa ho.
I felt very painful.	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ me yaw paa.
He was relieved, all the same.	Ne ho tɔɔ no, ne nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
You just have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa ara kwa.
I was in no shape for this	Ná minni tebea biara mu mma eyi
And it was very intelligent.	Na nyansa wom yiye.
I know something bad happened back there	Minim sɛ biribi bɔne bi sii wɔ hɔ akyi
I want to tell you.	Mepɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo.
He knows better than anyone.	Onim yiye sen obiara.
But it was difficult.	Nanso na ɛyɛ den.
I absolutely feel the same way	Mete nka saa ara koraa
I didn’t even know why.	Ná minnim nea enti a ɛte saa mpo.
He was the only one who did.	Ɔno nkutoo na ɔyɛɛ saa.
Maybe he’s for somewhere else entirely.	Ebia ɔyɛ ma baabi foforo koraa.
None of us should be interested in anything.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛn mu biara ani gye biribiara ho.
I found out about it.	Mihuu ho asɛm.
I shouldn’t be doing this	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi
I knew exactly what he was doing	Ná minim nea ɔreyɛ no yiye
It’s one thing after another.	Ɛyɛ ade biako akyi.
Everything was like that.	Ná biribiara te saa.
You can put your arm around the person	Wubetumi de wo nsa abɔ onipa no ho
That’s not why.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno nti na.
But people often can’t get this idea.	Nanso nnipa taa ntumi nnya saa adwene yi.
I wanted the kid, the house and the job	Na mepɛ abofra no, ofie no ne adwuma no
I hope you don’t	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wonyɛ saa
I understand the way	Mete ɔkwan no ase
I know my mom wants me to stay with her	Minim sɛ me maame pɛ sɛ me ne no tra
He is the boy in me.	Ɔno ne abarimaa a ɔte me mu no.
The bed itself is so comfortable.	Mpa no ankasa yɛ fɛ saa.
But you can’t do anything about it.	Nanso worentumi nyɛ ho hwee.
Everyone is trying so hard.	Obiara rebɔ mmɔden kɛse saa.
All these things with the same problem.	Saa nneɛma yi nyinaa a ɛwɔ ɔhaw koro no ara.
I just didn’t think he would ever use it	Na minsusuw sɛ ɔde bedi dwuma da bi kɛkɛ
It’s a lot of fun.	Ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
I wonder what you are doing now	Misusuw nea woreyɛ mprempren ho
I understand that point of view.	Mete saa adwene no ase.
This year alone.	Afe yi nkutoo.
You knew he was there.	Ná wunim sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ.
I still have a lot of friends there	Meda so ara wɔ nnamfo pii wɔ hɔ
I have to work it all out	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ne nyinaa ho adwuma
Nothing about that should be surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛno ho biribiara yɛ nwonwa.
Nor does he do that.	Saa ara nso na ɔnyɛ saa.
I have to be there tonight.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ anadwo yi.
The two of them make a pretty picture.	Wɔn baanu yɛ mfonini a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I have nothing wrong with them.	Minni bɔne biara wɔ wɔn ho.
You know that, but it’s not.	Wunim saa, nanso ɛnte saa.
I couldn't do that for a while.	Na mintumi nyɛ saa kakra no.
I just want to surrender to him	Mepɛ sɛ mede me ho ma no ara kwa
I thought about just going	Misusuw ho sɛ mɛkɔ kɛkɛ
It’s very, very bad.	Ɛyɛ bɔne paa, paa.
But it was a place I could live.	Nanso na ɛyɛ baabi a metumi tra.
Long story short.	Asɛm tenten.
However, there are two problems with this strategy.	Nanso, ɔhaw abien wɔ saa ɔkwan yi ho.
And there are many more of the same.	Na pii wɔ hɔ a ɛte saa ara.
An almost conscious image	Mfonini a ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛwɔ adwene mu
I hit my head against the back of the bed	Mede me ti bɔ mpa no akyi
I don't know where his head is these days.	Minnim baabi a ne ti wɔ nnansa yi.
This doesn’t have to happen to them.	Ɛho nhia sɛ eyi to wɔn.
I wanted to be there at the end	Ná mepɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ wɔ awiei no
I don’t always have it	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na mewɔ bi
At least it seemed that way.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
Somewhere in front of us is my mother.	Baabi a ɛwɔ yɛn anim no, me maame wɔ hɔ.
I have to do some work there	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma bi wɔ hɔ
I thought he was an equal	Misusuwii sɛ ɔne obi a ɔne no yɛ pɛ
Place both hands in the front leg.	Fa wo nsa abien no nyinaa to anim nan no mu.
That was when I knew the truth	Saa bere no na minim nokware no
I wanted to know where it was	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu baabi a ɛwɔ
However, I do.	Nanso, meyɛ saa.
I could do things, create things that no one else could	Ná metumi ayɛ nneɛma, abɔ nneɛma a obi foforo ntumi nyɛ
At least not with us.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ yɛn nkyɛn.
He is doing what needs to be done.	Ɔreyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
Just the simple things we all have in common.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw a yɛn nyinaa yɛ pɛ no ara kwa.
But he was no longer there.	Nanso na onni hɔ bio.
And there are reasons why it is so widely used.	Na nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a enti wɔde di dwuma kɛse saa.
As you say.	Sɛnea woka.
She was not his wife yet.	Ná ɔnyɛ ne yere de besi nnɛ.
I didn’t want to work in food anymore	Ná mempɛ sɛ mɛyɛ aduan ho adwuma bio
If we can do it, so can you.	Sɛ yebetumi ayɛ a, saa ara na wo nso wubetumi ayɛ.
A year later, he was gone.	Afe biako akyi no, na onni hɔ bio.
I can’t even find them attractive	Mintumi nhu wɔn sɛ wɔn ho yɛ fɛ mpo
I show it to people.	Mede kyerɛ nkurɔfo.
The face begins to look more human.	Anim no fi ase yɛ sɛ onipa kɛse.
I just want to know what you think	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea wususuw ara kwa
But there was obviously someone in the house.	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ na obi wɔ fie hɔ.
Such a very short time we have here.	Bere tiaa paa a ɛte saa a yɛwɔ wɔ ha.
And so did we.	Na yɛn nso.
A path must lead somewhere.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan bi kɔ baabi.
Many people came to the scene.	Nnipa pii baa hɔ.
He wants to do it.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no.
I knew how powerful you might be.	Ná minim sɛnea ebia wowɔ tumi fa.
Many new users don’t know how things work.	Nnipa foforo pii a wɔde di dwuma no nnim sɛnea nneɛma yɛ adwuma.
I love the whole thing	M’ani gye ade no nyinaa ho
I know enough to do	Minim nea ɛdɔɔso a metumi ayɛ
I had no idea what that was about	Ná minnim nea ɛno fa ho
And this is the reason why.	Na eyi ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
You certainly make good use of my information.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wode me ho nsɛm di dwuma yiye.
It’s such a beautiful hairstyle.	Ɛyɛ ti nhwi a ɛyɛ fɛ saa.
Different materials are used on the products	Wɔde nneɛma ahorow di dwuma wɔ nneɛma a wɔyɛ no so
I think about him all the time	Misusuw ne ho bere nyinaa
But there were no people outside.	Nanso na nnipa biara nni abɔnten.
He was shocked.	Ná ne ho dwiriw no.
A few points in the letter	Nsɛm kakraa bi a ɛwɔ krataa no mu
Maybe it wasn’t too late.	Ebia na ɛnyɛ nea aka akyi dodo.
Most were two bedrooms.	Ná dodow no ara yɛ mpa abien.
I am not any of these things	Menyɛ saa nneɛma yi mu biara
I didn’t know what to think or believe	Ná minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho anaa nea ɛsɛ sɛ migye di
Tell stories about yourself.	Ka wo ho nsɛm kyerɛ wo ho nsɛm.
This is not your money.	Eyi nyɛ wo sika.
I know I knew what that was	Minim sɛ na minim nea ɛno yɛ
There is no effort.	Mmɔden biara nni hɔ.
I want to see everything good in a person	Mepɛ sɛ mihu biribiara pa wɔ onipa mu
I still lived as a boy.	Meda so ara traa ase sɛ abarimaa.
I have done this too	Me nso mayɛ eyi
This system has been in place for a while.	Saa nhyehyɛe yi ayɛ adwuma bere tiaa bi ni.
That’s still not easy.	Ɛno da so ara nyɛ mmerɛw.
I have no idea where he lives	Minnim baabi a ɔte ho adwene biara
A business case has been added	Wɔde adwuma ho asɛm bi aka ho
We will become children.	Yɛbɛyɛ mmofra.
This has come at a significant financial cost.	Eyi aba wɔ sika fam ka kɛse mu.
But he’s a good kid.	Nanso ɔyɛ abofra pa.
I can’t believe this has happened	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ eyi aba
I was a kid, you know	Na meyɛ abofra, wunim
I had to close with him	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no to mu
I have no idea where he is	Minnim baabi a ɔwɔ ho adwene biara
I gave you the letter.	Mede krataa no maa wo.
I really enjoyed this dish	M’ani gyee saa aduan yi ho ankasa
I don't care why you want privacy.	Nea enti a wopɛ nsɛm a obiara nnim ho asɛm no mfa me ho.
We can make more from the same things.	Yebetumi afi nneɛma koro no ara mu ayɛ pii.
I focused on him	Mede m’adwene sii no so
But that was nothing new.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ ade foforo.
How, he didn't know.	Ɔkwan bɛn so no, na onnim.
I was strong yesterday	Na me ho yɛ den nnɛra
I really wanted to have dinner with you	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne wo di anwummere aduan ankasa
So it has been a successful week so far.	Enti ayɛ dapɛn a edi mu de besi nnɛ.
I thought this would be more difficult	Misusuwii sɛ eyi bɛyɛ den kɛse
Who would say such a thing.	Hena na ɔbɛka asɛm a ɛte saa.
They all do that.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ saa.
Watch out this week or next.	Hwɛ yiye dapɛn yi anaa nea edi hɔ no.
Nothing worked for me.	Biribiara anyɛ adwuma amma me.
I just can't see the problem	Mintumi nhu ɔhaw no ara kwa
He was there all day.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ da mũ nyinaa.
I look out the window	Mehwɛ mfɛnsere no mu
I hope no one else noticed	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ obi foforo biara anhu
This is what you do your problems.	Eyi ne nea woyɛ wo haw ahorow.
I loved the way he touched me	M’ani gyee sɛnea ɔde ne nsa kaa me ho no ho
I was for everything	Ná mewɔ biribiara ho
People make mistakes.	Nkurɔfo di mfomso.
And maybe it would work.	Na ebia na ɛbɛyɛ adwuma.
And that’s the big problem.	Na ɛno ne ɔhaw kɛse no.
You know, you play with them.	Wunim, wo ne wɔn di agoru.
I couldn’t do that to anyone else	Na mintumi nyɛ obi foforo biara saa
I think we’ll end there	Misusuw sɛ yɛde bɛba awiei wɔ hɔ
It’s a lot of it.	Ɛyɛ pii.
However, I know this	Nanso, minim eyi
Not a big one.	Ɛnyɛ kɛse bi.
I can’t understand it, either	Mintumi nte ase, nso
I can help you every day.	Metumi aboa wo da biara da.
I wonder if this is true	Misusuw sɛ ebia eyi yɛ nokware anaa
I had nothing to say to him	Ná minni biribiara a mɛka akyerɛ no
She would be my wife.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ me yere.
Understand everything well.	Te biribiara ase yiye.
Not now, not anymore.	Ɛnyɛ mprempren, ɛnyɛ saa bio.
Food is expensive.	Aduan bo yɛ den.
He leaned over to me.	Ɔde ne ho too me nkyɛn.
He was out last season.	Na ɔwɔ abɔnten wɔ afe a etwaam no mu.
It was many years ago.	Ná ɛyɛ mfe pii a atwam ni.
I wanted to sit next to him	Ná mepɛ sɛ mete ne nkyɛn
And by the way, neither are you.	Na ɔkwan bi so no, wo nso wonyɛ saa.
You brought it to an end.	Wode baa awiei.
It was a simple enough and powerful idea.	Na ɛyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ na ɛwɔ tumi.
I don’t want you to see this	Mempɛ sɛ wuhu eyi
I'm doing very well.	Meyɛ yiye yiye.
In most cases.	Mpɛn pii no.
A good thing at a reasonable price.	Ade pa a ne bo yɛ den.
But if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.	Nanso sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma a, ɛnyɛ adwuma.
Not wanting to make music or do anything.	Ɔpɛ a onni sɛ ɔbɛyɛ nnwom anaasɛ ɔbɛyɛ biribiara.
No one needs to know.	Ɛho nhia sɛ obiara hu.
And it’s been such a long time.	Na ɛyɛ bere tenten saa.
I don’t know if he was in the room.	Minnim sɛ ebia na ɔwɔ dan no mu anaa.
You can’t have one without the other.	Worentumi nnya biako a biako no nka ho.
He has all the power and privilege.	Ɔwɔ tumi ne hokwan nyinaa.
I don’t know what that was about	Minnim nea na ɛno fa ho
Get back to you.	San kɔ wo nkyɛn.
There are offers.	Nneɛma a wɔde ma wɔ hɔ.
He was actually here.	Ná ɔwɔ ha ankasa.
I don’t need to go on.	Ɛho nhia sɛ mekɔ so.
I couldn’t even do that	Ná mintumi nyɛ saa mpo
I had to take a closer look	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu yiye
I expected a lot from him	Ná mehwɛ nneɛma pii kwan fi ne hɔ
Or it was, anyway.	Anaasɛ na ɛyɛ, ɔkwan biara so.
I saw him with my own eyes	Mede m’ani huu no
I highly doubt that.	Migye saa asɛm no ho kyim kɛse.
I couldn’t take him any further	Na mintumi mfa no nkɔ akyiri bio
I had never felt that way with anyone	Ná me ne obiara nte nka saa da
Look after yourself, my son.	Hwɛ wo ho, me ba.
This meeting is over.	Saa nhyiam yi aba awiei.
I didn’t want to talk about it	Ná mempɛ sɛ meka ho asɛm
However, he did not know him well.	Nanso, na onnim no yiye.
Make it a day to remember.	Ma ɛnyɛ da a ɛsɛ sɛ wokae.
And so it is with him.	Na saa ara na ɔte.
It is not the case today.	Ɛnte saa nnɛ.
I am taking them both to your house now	Mede wɔn baanu nyinaa rekɔ wo fie seesei
I’m so impressed with you	M’ani gye wo ho yiye
Something was going on.	Ná biribi rekɔ so.
I didn't know him all that well	Ná minnim no yiye saa nyinaa
I want to feel good about something	Mepɛ sɛ mete nka sɛ m’ani agye biribi ho
I wish you would talk about it	Me yam a anka wobɛka ho asɛm
This way it works better.	Saa kwan yi so no ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
That can cause problems.	Ɛno betumi de ɔhaw ahorow aba.
Maybe something is going on here tonight, or maybe something is.	Ebia biribi rekɔ so wɔ ha anadwo yi, anaasɛ ebia biribi rekɔ so.
Give a test.	Ma sɔhwɛ bi.
All this in one day.	Eyi nyinaa wɔ da koro mu.
However, I wanted to keep talking	Nanso, na mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so kasa
At least I didn’t want one	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na mempɛ biako
Past and present.	Bere a atwam ne mprempren.
His next book.	Ne nhoma a edi hɔ no.
We just got to do plays when the plays showed up.	Yɛn nsa kaa sɛ yɛbɛyɛ agoru bere a agoru ahorow no kyerɛ ara kwa.
But he could handle it.	Nanso na obetumi adi ho dwuma.
It shouldn’t be for some reason.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ biribi nti.
But it still does.	Nanso ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
But in the end, it didn’t matter what he thought.	Nanso awiei koraa no, na nea osusuw ho no mfa ho.
I can already see what this is all about.	Metumi ahu nea eyi nyinaa fa ho dedaw.
He practically dropped himself.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho too ne ho so.
I only want wisdom	Nyansa nkutoo na mepɛ
I can see you have both	Metumi ahu sɛ wowɔ abien no nyinaa
In this table.	Wɔ saa pon yi so.
I love this new side of you.	M’ani gye wo fã foforo yi ho.
Many would soon go to prison.	Ná pii bɛkɔ afiase nnansa yi ara.
He knows his car.	Onim ne kar no.
It should be possible.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ yiye.
See additional information.	Hwɛ nsɛm foforo.
I want to do this as much as he does	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi sɛnea ɔno nso yɛ no
I thought it was wonderful.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I thought he was just one of them	Misusuwii sɛ ɔyɛ wɔn mu biako pɛ
I have plenty of money to buy them.	Mewɔ sika pii a mede bɛtɔ wɔn.
I looked just like him in the picture	Ná me ho te sɛ ɔno ara pɛ wɔ mfonini no mu
No one ever got in trouble.	Obiara ankɔ ɔhaw mu da biara.
Never go home the same way.	Mfa kwan koro no ara so nkɔ fie da.
They are always used.	Wɔde di dwuma bere nyinaa.
I just feel like I have to do something	Mete nka ara ne sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi
I could go there every day	Ná metumi akɔ hɔ da biara da
You need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
I wanted that to go down a bit	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɛno kɔ fam kakra
It’s not just one thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade biako pɛ.
I received your last letter	Me nsa kaa wo krataa a etwa to no
This is obviously true.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
I saw one of them	Mihuu wɔn mu biako
I am not a nice person.	Menyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
By then he had done three.	Saa bere no na wayɛ abiɛsa.
He doesn’t know anything.	Onnim hwee.
After all, I am only one	Ne nyinaa akyi no, meyɛ biako pɛ
Whether we are all one.	Sɛ́ ebia yɛn nyinaa yɛ biako anaa.
He wanted more.	Ná ɔpɛ pii.
I expect it to be, to be honest	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa, sɛ mɛka nokware a
Bad people can do good things.	Nnipa bɔne tumi yɛ nneɛma pa.
There was this part of me that was so excited.	Na me fã yi wɔ hɔ a ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
You’ve got your feet on the ground.	Wode wo nan ahyɛ fam.
You are the one who makes them.	Wo na woyɛ wɔn.
I did this for myself	Meyɛɛ eyi maa me ho
And I beg you.	Na mesrɛ wo.
I couldn’t believe them	Na mintumi nnye wɔn nni
Not like them.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ wɔn.
Maybe there would have been a happy ending after all.	Ebia anka awiei a ɛyɛ anigye bɛba wɔ ne nyinaa akyi.
I understand this very well.	Mete eyi ase yiye.
Eventually, you will tell us.	Awiei koraa no, wobɛka akyerɛ yɛn.
And uses the system.	Na ɔde di dwuma nhyehyɛe no.
I agreed with the chapter	Me ne ti no yɛɛ adwene
I didn’t like any of them	Ná m’ani nnye wɔn mu biara ho
And this is nothing new.	Na eyi nyɛ ade foforo.
I was just excited.	Ná m’ani agye ara kwa.
This also sounds strange.	Eyi nso te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
But this shouldn’t be surprising.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa.
And maybe it was, but you are the reason.	Na ebia na ɛte saa, nanso wo ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
But the problem was too great.	Nanso na ɔhaw no yɛ kɛse dodo.
But he had to do that.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
He was in great pain.	Ná ɔte yaw kɛse mu.
I just want it to be you and me	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ me ne wo ara kwa
The money, apart from anything else.	Sika no, sɛ biribi foforo biara da nkyɛn a.
I'm lying on the ground	Meda fam
He always seems so weak.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ mmerɛw saa bere nyinaa.
He had no intention of doing so.	Ná ɔnyɛ n’adwene sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I couldn’t imagine it being true either	Na mintumi nsusuw ho nso sɛ ɛyɛ nokware
It was easy to bring her.	Ná ɛnyɛ den sɛ ɔde no bɛba.
The two were one.	Ná wɔn baanu no yɛ biako.
In most cases.	Mpɛn pii no.
I still need to add more photos and stuff.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda so ara de mfonini ne nneɛma pii ka ho.
I think that might be just as wrong	Misusuw sɛ ebia ɛno nso yɛ mfomso saa ara
It won’t always be that way.	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Don’t make it feel so expensive.	Mma ɛnte nka sɛ ne bo yɛ den saa.
Maybe they are right.	Ebia wɔn asɛm no yɛ nokware.
It was beautiful, and he loved it.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ yiye, na na n’ani gye ho.
I still can’t do that.	Meda so ara ntumi nyɛ saa.
I have a room available	Mewɔ dan a ɛwɔ hɔ
It was the man.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔbarima no.
I sense something strange about you	Mete biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa nka wɔ wo ho
I couldn’t do anything	Ná mintumi nyɛ hwee
But it was helpful nonetheless.	Nanso na ɛyɛ mmoa ne nyinaa akyi.
Show that you are perfect for me.	Kyerɛ sɛ wo na woyɛ pɛ ma me.
I didn’t have to miss him anymore	Na enhia sɛ mepa no bio
I can still see pictures of them to this day	Meda so ara tumi hu wɔn mfonini de besi nnɛ
There are various reasons for this.	Nneɛma ahorow wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
We will always do that.	Yɛbɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa.
I almost know it is	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ minim sɛ ɛte saa
And it didn’t look like my hair.	Na na ɛnte sɛ me ti nhwi.
I can still feel his presence	Meda so ara tumi te nka sɛ ɔne me wɔ hɔ
If not, just get it today.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, gye no nnɛ ara kwa.
This made me interested.	Eyi maa m’ani gyee ho.
It only works for a few people.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ma nnipa kakraa bi pɛ.
I have friends there	Mewɔ nnamfo wɔ hɔ
I would say, do this, and he would do it.	Anka mɛka sɛ, yɛ eyi, na ɔno nso bɛyɛ.
There was nothing for him outside of home.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ mma no wɔ fie akyi.
A complete picture.	Mfonini a edi mũ.
It was pretty good, by the way.	Ná ɛyɛ papa yiye, ɔkwan bi so no.
I think it looks great	Misusuw sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye
Everyone else is home now.	Obiara a aka no wɔ fie mprempren.
I want to believe him though	Mepɛ sɛ migye no di nanso
It’s a bit like language.	Ɛte sɛ kasa kakra.
I know you’ll like him	Minim sɛ w’ani begye ne ho
That’s pretty much your power.	Ɛno yɛ wo tumi yiye.
I can’t imagine a day without you now	Mintumi nsusuw da bi a wo nka ho mprempren
Play it again, if you must.	Bɔ no bio, sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa a.
Without a doubt, it was.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛte saa.
I could have done that.	Anka metumi ayɛ saa.
This is a lot of money.	Eyi yɛ sika kɛse.
And I hope you both come through	Na mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo baanu nyinaa bɛba mu
Our father was nothing like that.	Ná yɛn papa nyɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
I think a lot about him, though, and his wife.	Nanso, misusuw ne ho pii, ne ne yere nso.
I didn’t know what was going on	Ná minnim nea ɛrekɔ so no
I love that it’s within a short drive	M’ani gye ho sɛ ɛwɔ kar kwan tiaa bi mu
If there were any.	Sɛ na bi wɔ hɔ a.
Only friends do that.	Nnamfo nkutoo na wɔyɛ saa.
You like where you are.	W’ani gye baabi a wowɔ ho.
I saw that look he gave you	Mihuu saa hwɛ a ɔde maa wo no
The meeting was easy.	Ná nhyiam no yɛ mmerɛw.
I keep seeing that man’s face	Mekɔ so hu saa ɔbarima no anim
I want it really fast	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm ankasa
No time, no way, nothing.	Bere biara nni hɔ, ɔkwan biara nni hɔ, biribiara nni hɔ.
This took too much time in the backfield.	Eyi gyee bere pii dodo wɔ akyi abɔnten so.
At least that’s what he told me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne nea ɔka kyerɛɛ me.
I thought you knew your stuff	Misusuwii sɛ wunim wo nneɛma
Perhaps he would eventually join them.	Ebia na awiei koraa no ɔbɛka wɔn ho.
I only have the first thing only	Mewɔ ade a edi kan nkutoo nkutoo
Tell me.	Ka kyerɛ me.
That’s him in the picture over there.	Ɛno ne ɔno a ɔwɔ mfonini no mu wɔ hɔ.
Apparently he did.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
I find it incredibly interesting	Mihu sɛ ɛyɛ anigye a ɛyɛ nwonwa
But that’s what you have to do.	Nanso ɛno ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I actually agree with him on that	Me ne no yɛ adwene wɔ saa asɛm no ho ankasa
Animals don’t.	Mmoa nyɛ saa.
I was there the next day	Ná mewɔ hɔ da a edi hɔ no
He knows this.	Onim eyi.
I want to talk about that	Mepɛ sɛ meka saa asɛm no ho asɛm
It was never just the two of them.	Na ɛnyɛ wɔn baanu nkutoo da.
The mind is nothing of the sort.	Adwene no nyɛ biribiara a ɛte saa.
I’m glad you touched me.	M’ani agye sɛ wode wo nsa kaa me.
That’s all something.	Ɛno nyinaa yɛ biribi.
Your mother was the same way.	Ná wo maame nso te saa ara.
To me this feels familiar, but something completely different from them.	Wɔ me fam no eyi te nka sɛ minim, nanso biribi foforo koraa fi wɔn hɔ.
This is certainly no accident.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi nyɛ akwanhyia.
I just want him to say what he knows	Nea mepɛ ara ne sɛ ɔka nea onim
He was a handsome man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
A police car was nearby.	Ná polisifo kar bi bɛn hɔ.
I feel accomplished being a part of that.	Mete nka sɛ mayɛ ade sɛ meyɛ saa ade no fã.
The point is here in the story.	Asɛm no wɔ ha wɔ asɛm no mu.
It was better than nothing, though.	Nanso, na eye sen sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
This is bigger than that.	Eyi yɛ kɛse sen saa.
This is quite possible.	Eyi betumi ayɛ yiye koraa.
A shot goes on	Tuo bi kɔ so
I have only one meeting left	Mewɔ nhyiam biako pɛ a aka
He was young and full of life.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra na na nkwa ahyɛ no ma.
No one else can see it.	Obi foforo biara ntumi nhu.
Thank you, he says.	Ɔka sɛ, meda wo ase.
He has to do well.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ade yiye.
I have a plan in place	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe bi a mede bɛyɛ adwuma
I couldn’t see him.	Na mintumi nhu no.
I want to be popular	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ obi a nkurɔfo ani gye ho
I was really good at it	Ná me ho akokwaw wɔ mu ankasa
This went on all night	Eyi kɔɔ so anadwo mũ no nyinaa
It seems unnecessary and easy.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛho nhia na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I was also an only child	Ná me nso meyɛ abofra koro pɛ
No doubt he was.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔyɛ saa.
But he could really reach you.	Nanso na obetumi adu wo nkyɛn ankasa.
We will do that.	Yɛbɛyɛ saa.
He used it again.	Ɔde dii dwuma bio.
I didn’t know anything about it.	Ná minnim ho hwee.
I want to do something about it	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ ho biribi
I can't tell if there's anything in it	Mintumi nhu sɛ biribi wɔ mu anaa
This was a late addition.	Ná eyi yɛ ade a wɔde kaa ho akyiri yi.
Or you can make a great meal.	Anaasɛ wubetumi ayɛ aduan kɛse bi.
I didn’t know anything about it	Ná minnim ho hwee
The next thing he was gone.	Nea edi hɔ ne sɛ na onni hɔ bio.
He had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
They were doing that.	Ná wɔyɛ saa.
I lost sight of them	M’ani fii wɔn so
However, I really like it	Nanso, mepɛ no ankasa
His cry pointed to a man.	Ne su no kyerɛɛ ɔbarima bi.
All the details.	Nsɛm no nyinaa.
I want to know how powerful you are	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea wowɔ tumi kɛse
I can’t tell anyone about this	Mintumi nka eyi ho asɛm nkyerɛ obiara
I almost didn’t care anymore	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na ɛnyɛ me asɛm bio
I want to know more about him	Mepɛ sɛ mihu ne ho nsɛm pii
There are many reasons for this.	Nneɛma pii nti na ɛte saa.
It’s a thing of the past.	Ɛyɛ nea atwam.
What these kids have to go through is terrible.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra yi fa mu no yɛ hu.
But this is anything but the truth.	Nanso eyi yɛ biribiara gye sɛ nokware no.
It was really happening.	Ná ɛrekɔ so ankasa.
A month was a long time.	Ná ɔsram biako yɛ bere tenten.
A very important day.	Da a ɛho hia yiye.
I didn’t care about tomorrow	Ná ɔkyena ho asɛm mfa me ho
If nothing else exists.	Sɛ biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
The way this all plays out .	Ɔkwan a eyi nyinaa fa so di agoru no .
I want you to do two things	Mepɛ sɛ woyɛ nneɛma abien
Most of it is amazing.	Ne mu dodow no ara yɛ nwonwa.
I was here when this started	Na mewɔ ha bere a eyi fii ase no
I really want to be with you	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo bɔ ampa
There is good, and there is evil.	Papa wɔ hɔ, na bɔne nso wɔ hɔ.
And so did his mother.	Na ne maame nso.
I heard that there.	Metee saa asɛm no wɔ hɔ.
Besides, on a final note.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, wɔ nsɛm a etwa to bi so.
But this is very difficult.	Nanso eyi yɛ den yiye.
I just wanted to be alone with my pain	Ná mepɛ sɛ me nkutoo ne me yaw no tra hɔ ara kwa
Many days are difficult.	Nna pii yɛ den.
I just get away with it	Mede me ho fi so ara kwa
I would have done this sooner	Anka mɛyɛ eyi ntɛm
Thank your mom for the lovely card.	Da wo maame ase wɔ krataa a ɛyɛ fɛ no ho.
I would have done that.	Anka mɛyɛ saa.
Shortly after this incident.	Bere tiaa bi wɔ asɛm yi akyi.
There was no one in the driveway of the house.	Ná obiara nni ofie no mu kar kwan no so.
I know where this is going	Minim baabi a eyi rekɔ
The other way around.	Ɔkwan foforo no so.
After a moment his attention returned to the phone.	Bere tiaa bi akyi no n’adwene san baa telefon no so.
I did the same thing	Meyɛɛ no ​​saa ara
It seemed, somehow, easy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea, wɔ ɔkwan bi so no, ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
The road has remained the same ever since	Ɔkwan no akɔ so ayɛ nea ɛte saa ara fi saa bere no
No one way is better than another.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ a eye sen foforo.
That was the first time in all those years.	Ɛno ne bere a edi kan wɔ saa mfe no nyinaa mu.
I am not alone in this	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na mewɔ eyi mu
He slipped in again.	Ɔde ne ho too mu bio.
For a moment, everyone was shocked.	Bere tiaa bi mu no, obiara ho dwiriw no.
This means everything.	Eyi kyerɛ biribiara.
Thank you so much for the perfect day.	Meda mo ase pii wɔ da a ɛyɛ pɛ no ho.
However, this was not the case.	Nanso, na eyi nte saa.
That doesn’t matter.	Ɛno ho nhia.
He loves making this face.	N’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa anim yi.
I certainly believe they are a way ahead.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ migye di sɛ wɔyɛ ɔkwan bi a ɛda yɛn anim.
Do this first.	Di kan yɛ eyi.
However, this is not the case.	Nanso, eyi nte saa.
I add new songs every week	Mede nnwom foforo ka ho dapɛn biara
I was very concerned about this problem.	Ná ɔhaw yi haw me paa.
I wanted to tell stories	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka nsɛm
I had to do this for him	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi ma no
His words hurt him a little	Ne nsɛm no yɛɛ no ​​yaw kakra
Their group song.	Wɔn kuw dwom no.
I have known him for a few years	Mfe kakra ni na minim no
It’s a big deal.	Ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse.
I feel his feelings.	Mete ne nka.
Allow people to figure things out for themselves.	Ma nkurɔfo kwan ma wɔn ankasa nsusuw nneɛma ho.
Forget about being nice.	Wo werɛ mfi sɛ wobɛyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I couldn’t sleep at all	Ná mintumi nna koraa
I found both in his car	Mihuu abien no nyinaa wɔ ne kar no mu
However, there was a bit of a problem.	Nanso, na ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ kakra.
I didn’t need to know anymore.	Ná enhia sɛ mihu bio.
I think he is wrong	Misusuw sɛ odi mfomso
I had to be there, right then	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ, saa bere no ara
I had to be the best	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nea eye sen biara
But this is not the case.	Nanso eyi nte saa.
I couldn’t really figure out what his problem was	Na mintumi nhu nea ne haw no yɛ ankasa
I didn’t want to go without you	Na mempɛ sɛ mekɔ a wo nka ho
He was here today.	Ná ɔwɔ ha nnɛ.
I have something better to do.	Mewɔ biribi a eye sen saa a mɛyɛ.
But that could also come from what I like.	Nanso ɛno nso betumi afi nea m’ani gye ho no mu aba.
This is just a mistake.	Eyi yɛ mfomso ara kwa.
I was no longer needed	Ná me ho nhia bio
I could have done without this	Sɛ eyi nni hɔ a, anka metumi ayɛ saa
We were really into that.	Ná yɛwɔ saa asɛm no mu ankasa.
I couldn’t hear anyone	Na mintumi nte obiara
That 's been enough.	Ɛno 'ayɛ nea ɛdɔɔso.
The sooner the better.	Dodow a ɛyɛ ntɛm no, dodow no ara na eye.
I always do, you know	Meyɛ saa bere nyinaa, wunim
I am well into one.	Mewɔ biako mu yiye.
I am in good hands	Mewɔ nsa pa mu
There should be some of that too.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno nso bi wɔ hɔ.
Remember this way.	Kae saa kwan yi.
At least not for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ me.
I am strong about it.	Meyɛ den wɔ ho.
I think of whatever he wants	Misusuw nea ɔpɛ biara ho
People can see that a gun is real.	Nkurɔfo betumi ahu sɛ tuo yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
I love what they do.	M’ani gye nea wɔyɛ no ho.
So it’s not much of a surprise.	Enti ɛnyɛ nwonwa kɛse.
That is very important to us.	Ɛno ho hia yɛn paa.
I am still doing this.	Meda so ara yɛ eyi.
I was working on the floor alone	Ná me nkutoo na mereyɛ adwuma wɔ fam
I nodded my head	Mede me ti bɔɔ mu
I saw what must have happened	Mihuu nea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ esii
There is truth.	Nokware wɔ hɔ.
The past is never pretty.	Nea atwam no nyɛ fɛ da.
I felt amazing, so did my friends	Ná mete nka sɛ me ho yɛ nwonwa, saa ara na na me nnamfo nso te
The first is power management.	Nea edi kan ne tumi a wɔde di dwuma.
I drove that down, literally	Mede saa kar no kɔɔ fam, sɛnea ɛte ankasa
After that, it’s up to you.	Ɛno akyi no, ɛyɛ wo so.
Lots and lots of them.	Wɔn mu pii ne pii.
I have been very busy	Mayɛ obi a onni adagyew koraa
I know him very well.	Minim no yiye.
I still don't use it very often.	Meda so ara mfa nni dwuma mpɛn pii.
So this was the one.	Enti na eyi ne no.
I know you want to see your mother	Minim sɛ wopɛ sɛ wuhu wo maame
I wanted to say don't do that.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka sɛ nyɛ saa.
I wonder what else he knows	Misusuw sɛ dɛn bio na onim
It shouldn’t be that way.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I hope everything works out	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ biribiara bɛyɛ yiye
I am very concerned about this.	Eyi ho asɛm haw me kɛse.
Not as it is now.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea ɛte mprempren no.
I would definitely appreciate that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ m’ani begye saa asɛm no ho.
That one is off to a good start.	Saa biako no afi ase wɔ ɔkwan pa so.
So that was that.	Enti na ɛno ne saa.
I had no idea this was even possible	Ná minnim sɛ eyi betumi ayɛ yiye mpo
I was always more my father’s son than his	Ná meyɛ me papa ba sen ne de bere nyinaa
I felt like I was in pain	Metee nka sɛ me ho ayɛ me yaw
I am new to this industry but I love learning.	Meyɛ foforo wɔ saa adwuma yi mu nanso m’ani gye adesua ho.
Which is just what happened.	Nea ɛyɛ nea esii no ara kwa.
That wasn’t good enough.	Ná ɛno nyɛ papa.
I do everything for me.	Meyɛ biribiara ma me.
I know everyone.	Minim obiara.
So we are on our own.	Enti yɛwɔ yɛn ankasa so.
I never knew them that way	Na minnim wɔn saa kwan no so da
Time should be treated the same as money.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde bere di dwuma sɛnea wɔde sika di dwuma no ara pɛ.
But he’s the best for me.	Nanso ɔno na ɔyɛ papa ma me.
I always have time for you	Mewɔ bere ma wo bere nyinaa
But in this case, everything was done with the book.	Nanso wɔ eyi mu no, wɔde nhoma no yɛɛ biribiara.
He was faster than that.	Ná ɔyɛ ntɛm sen saa.
That’s the idea.	Ɛno ne adwene no.
While we are here.	Bere a yɛwɔ ha no.
He had the power.	Ná ɔwɔ tumi no.
It certainly doesn’t hurt.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnyɛ yaw.
I didn’t want to go anywhere else	Ná mempɛ sɛ mekɔ baabi foforo biara
Do every problem in the book even if that is not necessary.	Yɛ ɔhaw biara a ɛwɔ nhoma no mu sɛ ɛno ho nhia mpo a.
I was told that would be the best first	Wɔka kyerɛɛ me sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ nea edi kan a eye sen biara
In those days, I knew your mother	Saa nna no mu no, na minim wo maame
I always have one	Mewɔ bi bere nyinaa
This problem is over.	Saa ɔhaw yi aba awiei.
Simple, elegant, functional yet powerful.	Ɛnyɛ den, ɛyɛ fɛ, ɛyɛ adwuma nanso ɛwɔ tumi.
I have another reason for being here though	Mewɔ biribi foforo nti a mewɔ ha de, nanso
You don’t need it.	Wo ho nhia.
I didn’t have to act on it	Ná enhia sɛ meyɛ ho ade
Additional packaging is provided.	Wɔde nneɛma foforo a wɔde ahyɛ mu ma.
I can't make it work.	Mintumi mma ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I was no longer needed	Ná me ho nhia me bio
He didn’t know.	Ná onnim.
Like you said, go somewhere first.	Sɛnea wokae no, di kan kɔ baabi.
Everything.	Biribiara.
I hadn’t thought about that	Ná minsusuw saa asɛm no ho
I had never forgotten his eyes	Ná me werɛ mfi n’ani da
I loved the book and the characters	M’ani gyee nhoma no ne nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no ho
He had no idea what was going on.	Ná onni nea ɛrekɔ so no ho adwene biara.
This is one terrible thing.	Eyi yɛ ade biako a ɛyɛ hu.
I have known you too long	Minim wo akyɛ dodo
It just works.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ara kwa.
None of this is true.	Eyi mu biara nyɛ nokware.
I have to hurry home	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ntɛm kɔ fie
For the next two hours, this continued.	Wɔ nnɔnhwerew abien a edi hɔ no mu no, eyi kɔɔ so.
Everything will be new.	Biribiara bɛyɛ foforo.
He and his	Ɔne ne .
There is a lot of information you can get in error.	Nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ a wubetumi anya wɔ mfomso.
I know he would be one	Minim sɛ anka ɔbɛyɛ biako
As if he knew something no one else knew.	Te sɛ nea onim biribi a obiara nnim.
Every picture has a story to tell.	Mfonini biara wɔ asɛm bi a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka.
Everyone is doing the same thing	Obiara reyɛ ade koro
But he is wrong.	Nanso odi mfomso.
I don't really know why.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa.
This is really a great representation of what it looks like in the past.	Eyi yɛ sɛnea ɛte sɛ nea atwam no ho mfonini kɛse ankasa.
It will be what it is supposed to be.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
To do so.	Sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
You have beautiful people.	Wowɔ nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
But every day is just awful.	Nanso da biara da yɛ hu ara kwa.
I don’t know his name.	Minnim ne din.
The last of these.	Nea etwa to koraa no.
But the end of the month will be good.	Nanso ɔsram no awiei bɛyɛ papa.
Just kind of walked it.	Kɛkɛ ɔkwan bi so nantew no.
I’m not happy anymore	M’ani nnye bio
Best for the kids.	Nea eye sen biara ma mmofra no.
It’s time to take action.	Ɛyɛ bere a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ho biribi.
In the past it wasn’t.	Kan no na ɛnte saa.
Two police officers came out.	Polisifo baanu fii adi.
I thought we had a home, you and me	Misusuwii sɛ yɛwɔ ofie, me ne wo
I am all that I ever was	Me ne nea na mewɔ hɔ pɛn nyinaa
I could never figure out why	Na mintumi nhu nea enti a ɛte saa da
I didn’t want to tell him	Na mempɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no
It’s not here and it’s here.	Ɛnyɛ ha na ɛwɔ ha.
I should have done it a long time ago	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ no bere tenten a atwam ni
I think you know how much that meant to me	Misusuw sɛ wunim sɛnea na ɛno kyerɛ me kɛse
One boy’s face is still with me.	Abarimaa biako anim da so ara wɔ me ho.
I wanted to do something for you	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi ma wo
But this was not ideal.	Nanso na eyi nyɛ nea eye sen biara.
I can control it.	Metumi adi so.
Everything is brand new.	Biribiara yɛ foforo koraa.
I am surprised by it	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa wɔ ho
The scary one is also the easiest one.	Nea ɛyɛ hu no nso ne nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sen biara.
Hang up when necessary.	Fa telefon no to hɔ bere a ɛho hia no.
I couldn’t see anyone else, just him	Na mintumi nhu obi foforo biara, ɔno nkutoo
I'm sure his father had a lot to do with that.	Migye di sɛ na ne papa wɔ pii yɛ wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I like that a lot and I love it	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho kɛse na m’ani gye ho
I am a little surprised by this.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa kakra wɔ eyi ho.
I head to my room.	Mede m’ani kyerɛ me dan mu.
I need your help.	Mepɛ mo mmoa.
I believe that is his intention.	Migye di sɛ ɛno ne n’adwene.
He relied on his son to help him.	Ɔde ne ho too ne ba no so sɛ ɔbɛboa no.
At this point, the characters are out of their picture.	Saa bere yi de, nnipa a wɔka ho asɛm no afi wɔn mfonini no mu.
I want to hang out with them	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wɔn bɔ
I didn’t even know what it was	Ná minnim nea ɛyɛ mpo
I just felt so alone	Nea na mete nka ara ne sɛ me nkutoo na mete nka kɛse
Did no one tell me.	So obiara anka ankyerɛ me.
I saw this article just now.	Mihuu saa asɛm yi mprempren ara.
I don’t want them anymore	Mempɛ wɔn bio
But it wasn’t easy.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw.
I'm making statements.	Meyɛ nsɛm.
I know exactly what they are	Minim nea wɔyɛ ankasa
Evil.	Bɔne.
I can introduce you to you	Metumi de wo akyerɛ wo
I had to be like him	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ sɛ ɔno
All in a day’s work, unnecessarily.	Ne nyinaa wɔ da koro adwuma mu, a ɛho nhia.
You don’t have to be happy.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ w’ani gye.
They hardly need money to do it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ sika ho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ.
I have to tell him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no.
I must matter to someone	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ho hia obi
I forgot to mention it earlier	Me werɛ fii sɛ mɛka ho asɛm kan
It was a long time ago.	Ná ɛyɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
Other things we don’t like so well.	Nneɛma foforo a yɛn ani nnye ho yiye saa.
I hope something good happens	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ biribi pa bi bɛba
No one told me his name.	Obiara anka ne din ankyerɛ me.
That wasn’t a man.	Ná ɛno nyɛ ɔbarima.
We must have been alone, and it was late in the evening.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na yɛn nkutoo wɔ hɔ, na na ɛyɛ anwummere.
I should have known that	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu saa
I didn’t know that.	Ná minnim saa asɛm no.
She was very young and beautiful.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra paa na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
It doesn’t matter what you have to say.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ woka no mfa ho.
I got them just for you	Me nsa kaa wɔn maa wo nkutoo
However, he is not lying.	Nanso, ɔnyɛ atoro.
I heard everything in that room	Metee biribiara a ɛwɔ saa dan no mu
The story is still there.	Asɛm no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
I gave you a plan	Mede nhyehyɛe bi maa wo
He just thought it was the best.	Ná osusuw ara kwa sɛ ɛno ne nea eye sen biara.
I'm telling you the truth	Meka nokware ma wo
The story is the first and last thing.	Asɛm no ne ade a edi kan ne nea etwa to.
I didn’t know what to do with him	Ná minnim nea me ne no bɛyɛ
I didn’t always do that	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na na meyɛ saa
Everyone but me.	Obiara gye me nkutoo.
Just walk with your hands.	Fa wo nsa nantew kɛkɛ.
I have to go to my mother	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ me maame nkyɛn
Check out our photos.	Hwɛ yɛn mfonini ahorow no.
I knew it was a bad idea	Ná minim sɛ ɛyɛ adwene bɔne
I'm getting it.	Me nsa ka.
I can’t see how anyone could know	Mintumi nhu sɛnea obi betumi ahu
All the best of it.	Nea eye sen biara no nyinaa.
They work quickly.	Wɔyɛ adwuma ntɛmntɛm.
I had the same thing	Ná mewɔ ade koro no ara
I have no problem sending you to jail	Minni ɔhaw biara sɛ mede wo bɛkɔ afiase
So, our story follows.	Enti, yɛn asɛm no di akyi.
It’s definitely a great opportunity.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ hokwan kɛse.
I forgot how beautiful this part of the car is	Me werɛ fii sɛnea saa kar no fã yi yɛ fɛ no
At least you can be happy.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wubetumi anya anigye.
Keep it simple and fun.	Ma ɛnyɛ mmerɛw na ɛnyɛ anigye.
The bed was the same.	Ná mpa no nso te saa ara.
I knew he sounded familiar	Ná minim sɛ ɔte sɛ nea onim no yiye
Keep doing what you’re doing.	Kɔ so yɛ nea woreyɛ no.
Good luck with your important work this afternoon.	Momma mo ani nnye mo adwuma a ɛho hia no ho awia yi.
Same thing for the most part.	Ade koro no ara wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu.
He was here last year.	Ná ɔwɔ ha afe a etwaam no.
Or a handful of them.	Anaasɛ nsa bi.
Is that what you really want?.	So ɛno na wopɛ ampa?.
I had to be careful	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye
Introduce the people.	Fa nnipa no kyerɛ wɔn.
It was still too early for anyone to be there.	Ná ɛda so ara yɛ ntɛm dodo sɛ obiara bɛba hɔ.
No one had ever done that before.	Ná obiara nyɛɛ saa da.
This was not the case at all.	Ná eyi nyɛ nea ɛte saa koraa.
I like him and he likes me	M’ani gye ne ho na ɔno nso pɛ me
But my house has enough of that.	Nanso me fie no wɔ saa nneɛma no a ɛdɔɔso.
I can still hear his words	Meda so ara tumi te ne nsɛm
I couldn’t allow that	Na mintumi mma saa kwan
I can set the timing of the performance	Metumi ahyɛ bere a wɔde bɛyɛ agoru no
I guess it’s up to me	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ me na ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ
I can start working it as soon as this summer	Metumi afi ase ayɛ no adwuma ntɛm ara wɔ awɔw bere yi mu
I would really appreciate any help	M’ani begye mmoa biara ho ankasa
They were about the same age.	Ná wɔn mfe bɛyɛ pɛ.
Work is in progress in this direction.	Adwuma rekɔ so wɔ saa kwan yi so.
That just makes him a product of his time.	Ɛno ma ɔyɛ ne bere so ade ara kwa.
This is a difficult task.	Eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den.
But it seems to work.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma.
Again, it doesn’t matter.	Bio nso, ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia.
It had to be there.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ.
He leaned a little closer to her.	Ɔde ne ho too ne nkyɛn kakra.
The information would also be wrong.	Anka nsɛm no nso bɛyɛ mfomso.
I can barely see.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nhu ade.
Something was very wrong, he knew that.	Na biribi anyɛ yiye koraa, na onim saa.
Maybe he was there.	Ebia na ɔwɔ hɔ.
I kind of figured that out	Mede ɔkwan bi so susuw saa asɛm no ho
I want to bring that back.	Mepɛ sɛ mede saa asɛm no san ba.
I could never seem to make enough money	Ná ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nnya sika a ɛdɔɔso da
It wasn’t really anything else.	Ná ɛnyɛ biribi foforo ankasa.
I told you yesterday that you should trust me	Meka kyerɛɛ wo nnɛra sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ho to me so
He would do the hard things.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ nneɛma a ɛyɛ den no.
I had done everything I could.	Ná mayɛ biribiara a metumi ayɛ.
Or on the clothes.	Anaasɛ wɔ ntade no so.
Not this time either.	Ɛnyɛ saa bere yi nso.
He had to do it himself.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa yɛ.
I have a deadline to go on	Mewɔ bere a etwa to a ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so
Thank you so much!!.	Meda wo ase pa ara!!.
The intervention is difficult.	Ade a wɔde wɔn ho gye mu no yɛ den.
But there is that it is.	Nanso ɛwɔ hɔ sɛ ɛyɛ.
You yourself are getting weaker.	Wo ankasa wo ho reyɛ ayɛ mmerɛw.
All those settings are in the window.	Saa nhyehyɛe ahorow no nyinaa wɔ mfɛnsere mu.
I wanted them both	Ná mepɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa
Maybe that’s the case, or maybe not.	Ebia saa na ɛte saa, anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
I missed you all too	Me nso me werɛ fii mo nyinaa
I know you think I’m a monster	Minim sɛ wususuw sɛ meyɛ aboa kɛse
I would definitely enjoy any of those books.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ m’ani begye saa nhoma ahorow no mu biara ho.
But with words, it was pretty good.	Nanso sɛ yɛde nsɛm ka ho a, na eye yiye.
He wanted to work for a while in a big city.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma kakra wɔ kurow kɛse bi mu.
I can’t say enough about them	Mintumi nka wɔn ho asɛm a ɛdɔɔso
I settled into the room	Mede me ho traa dan no mu
I know you are out there	Minim sɛ wowɔ abɔnten hɔ
I'll give you a year.	Mede afe biako bɛma wo.
It looked good enough.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I think it might be someone else	Misusuw sɛ ebia ɛyɛ obi foforo
I expected him to tell me the truth	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɔbɛka nokware no akyerɛ me
I knew exactly how he felt	Ná minim sɛnea ɔte nka no yiye
He seems mentally challenged.	Ɛte sɛ nea adwene mu ayɛ no den.
His timeline.	Ne bere nhyehyɛe.
But it was never easy for them.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ mmerɛw mma wɔn da.
I was out of school in the summer	Ná minni sukuu wɔ awɔw bere mu
Just know that it’s great.	Hu ara sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse.
I must be in you	Ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ wo mu
And their eyes.	Na wɔn ani.
I had an interesting presentation this morning	Meyɛɛ asɛm a wɔka kyerɛ a ɛyɛ anigye anɔpa yi
There was nothing remarkable about it.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ hɔ.
And no one has, either.	Na obiara nyɛɛ saa, nso.
I give him my everything	Mede me biribiara ma no
However, this view is also wrong.	Nanso, saa adwene yi nso yɛ mfomso.
The rights have nothing to do with it.	Hokwan ahorow no ne no nni hwee yɛ.
The street is clear.	Abɔnten so da hɔ.
I didn’t have to believe it	Ná enhia sɛ migye di
The house was packed.	Ná ofie hɔ ayɛ ma.
We are idle when we have to work.	Yɛyɛ kwa bere a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma no.
But that doesn’t mean anything.	Nanso ɛno nkyerɛ hwee.
We are friends.	Yɛyɛ nnamfo.
I really enjoy the time I spend with his team.	M’ani gye bere a mede ne kuw no tra hɔ no ho ankasa.
On paper, this probably sounds pretty good.	Wɔ krataa so no, ɛbɛyɛ sɛ eyi te sɛ nea eye yiye.
What would he do anyway.	Dɛn na anka ɔbɛyɛ ɔkwan biara so.
It’s just our opinion.	Ɛyɛ yɛn adwene ara kwa.
I want to do it this way	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ no saa kwan yi so
If he is told about the situation, he may help.	Sɛ wɔka tebea no ho asɛm kyerɛ no a, ebia ɔbɛboa.
He was somewhere else.	Ná ɔwɔ baabi foforo.
That had to be his real name.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ne ne din ankasa.
I think the truth is simple	Misusuw sɛ nokware no yɛ mmerɛw
So this is not the first time.	Enti eyi nyɛ bere a edi kan.
That just happened.	Ɛno sii ara kwa.
Or the week.	Anaasɛ dapɛn no.
My animals were happy.	Ná me mmoa no ani agye.
How much better it will be.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye kɛse.
I have no idea but them.	Minni adwene biara gye wɔn nkutoo.
We are very involved in this project.	Yɛde yɛn ho ahyɛ saa adwuma yi mu kɛse.
I’ve always liked the name	M’ani gye din no ho bere nyinaa
It was his eyes that were the worst.	Ɛyɛ n’ani na na ɛyɛ bɔne sen biara.
He loved that movie.	Ná n’ani gye saa sini no ho.
The city could do it again.	Ná kurow no betumi ayɛ bio.
I think he was on to something.	Misusuw sɛ na ɔwɔ biribi so.
I hope to go there one day.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mɛkɔ hɔ da bi.
My mom didn’t even have a job.	Ná me maame nni adwuma mpo.
You are in the house.	Wowɔ ofie no mu.
And it looked terrible.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ hu.
Get over yourself, kid.	Fa wo ho to wo ho so, abofra.
I have two hours all to myself	Mewɔ nnɔnhwerew abien a mede ne nyinaa bɛma me ho
That thing will happen.	Saa ade no bɛba.
I was important out there	Ná me ho hia wɔ abɔnten hɔ
Surely someone would have come in by now.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ anka obi bɛba mu saa bere yi.
It’s all very interesting.	Ne nyinaa yɛ anigye yiye.
The human face is what interests us	Onipa anim asɛm ne nea yɛn ani gye ho
The school had any population.	Ná sukuu no wɔ nnipa dodow biara.
The school offers half-day and full-day kindergarten.	Sukuu no de da fã ne da mũ nyinaa mmofra sukuu ma.
I really didn’t know what that meant	Ankasa na minnim nea ɛno kyerɛ
It was amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I can't quite figure out what actually happened	Mintumi nhu nea esii ankasa no yiye
He owes that to his wife and children.	Ɔde saa asɛm no ka ne yere ne ne mma.
But he doesn’t.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa.
I had a busy weekend that	Na mewɔ dapɛn awiei a adagyew nnim sɛ
I don’t see them.	Me no nhu wɔn.
Mom was very worried.	Maame haw kɛse.
Please tell me more about that.	Mesrɛ wo ka saa asɛm no ho nsɛm pii kyerɛ me.
I think there is a whole thing	Misusuw sɛ ade mũ bi wɔ hɔ
Like mine, as far as that goes.	Te sɛ me de no, sɛnea ɛno kɔ akyiri no.
However, they had to do so.	Nanso, na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Did he know? 	So na onim?
I could use another girl	Ná metumi de abeawa foforo adi dwuma
It really is that simple in some cases.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa ankasa wɔ nsɛm bi mu.
I did and I still do.	Meyɛɛ saa na meda so ara yɛ saa.
I could play this game too	Ná me nso metumi adi saa agoru yi
A great feast for him and us.	Apontow kɛse bi ma ɔne yɛn.
Maybe even me.	Ebia me mpo.
He says I have to act	Ɔka sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ agoru
Nobody works here.	Obiara nyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
I felt exposed and amazing	Metee nka sɛ meda adi na me ho yɛ nwonwa
I believe it is an important contribution to the literature	Migye di sɛ ɛyɛ mmoa a ɛho hia a wɔde ma wɔ nhoma ahorow mu
I didn’t have the gun.	Ɛnyɛ me na na mewɔ tuo no.
I can't take the cry	Mintumi nnye su no
Make it important.	Ma ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia.
It’s not surprising either.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa nso.
My mother told me.	Me maame ka kyerɛɛ me.
I had that shirt too, but it was on the dress	Ná mewɔ saa atade no nso, nanso na ɛwɔ atade no so
Wrong or not.	Mfomso anaasɛ ɛnte saa.
I love working for you	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ adwuma ama wo
I still can’t believe he did	Meda so ara ntumi nnye nni sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa
But he just nodded.	Nanso ɔde ne ti too fam kɛkɛ.
I did my best with those things	Meyɛɛ nea metumi biara wɔ saa nneɛma no ho
This is a terrible situation.	Eyi yɛ tebea a ɛyɛ hu.
There was a lot of play	Ná agoru pii wɔ hɔ
But it may not be the last.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ nea etwa to.
I know the man well.	Minim ɔbarima no yiye.
I, I wish he wouldn’t	Me, me yam a anka ɔnyɛ saa
And that’s how we have to do that.	Na saa na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
I was once very beautiful and powerful	Bere bi na me ho yɛ fɛ yiye na mewɔ tumi
He would stick a leg in it.	Ná ɔde ne nan bi bɛbɔ mu.
I sleep through the night and was asleep all day	Meda anadwo mũ no nyinaa na na meda da mũ nyinaa
Mom told me about you just a year ago.	Maame kaa wo ho asɛm kyerɛɛ me afe biako pɛ a atwam ni.
I hope there is nothing wrong with me	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mfomso biara nni me ho
There are many reasons why.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti.
I have so much of it.	Mewɔ pii saa.
A picture and a letter were placed in the background	Wɔde mfonini ne krataa bi sii akyi
A little more expensive for a bigger room	Kakraa bi a ne bo yɛ den ma dan kɛse
I want to thank him here	Mepɛ sɛ meda no ase wɔ ha
I didn’t want to do it.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ.
I can’t think about food right now	Mintumi nsusuw aduan ho mprempren
I can't say that.	Mintumi nka saa asɛm no.
I don’t want any part of it	Mempɛ ne fã biara
Imagine this as a story.	Fa no sɛ eyi yɛ asɛm bi.
I locked his eyes in mine	Mede n’ani bɔɔ me de no mu
But it was also someone else.	Nanso na ɛyɛ obi foforo nso.
I just saw something	Mihuu biribi ara kwa
Don't quite know what to say.	Nnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ woka yiye.
You say he was in on that.	Woka sɛ na ɔwɔ saa asɛm no mu.
Water is a thing.	Nsu yɛ ade.
He liked it, too.	N’ani gyee ho, nso.
I needed to see him, one last time	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no, nea etwa to
Another living way	Ɔkwan foforo a ɛte ase
Real power is internal.	Tumi ankasa yɛ nea ɛwɔ mu.
You can’t see him.	Worentumi nhu no.
Touch you, so bad.	Ka wo hwɛ, bɔne saa.
Nobody just got inside.	Obiara antumi ankɔ mu kɛkɛ.
He did that a couple of times when he was in the back.	Ɔyɛɛ saa mpɛn abien bere a na ɔwɔ akyi no.
It’s never one man.	Ɛnyɛ ɔbarima biako da.
We absolutely have to.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa koraa.
Tonight, he didn't care.	Anadwo yi, na ɛnyɛ no asɛm.
Boy, they do that.	Abarimaa, wɔyɛ saa.
This affected the next day	Eyi kaa ade da a edi hɔ no
Can you help me where am I wrong.	So wubetumi aboa me baabi a me mfomso wɔ.
Or maybe it’s not.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
He worked for them.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma maa wɔn.
You come early which is very important	Wo ba ntɛm a ɛho hia kɛse
He does what he says.	Ɔyɛ nea ɔka.
But it’s just another part of the game.	Nanso ɛyɛ agoru no fã foforo ara kwa.
I actually work all the time	Meyɛ adwuma bere nyinaa ankasa
There must be something else.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
And he didn’t want to eat it.	Na na ɔmpɛ sɛ odi no.
I want him and my dad too	Mepɛ ɔne me papa nso
What do you want to see next?.	Dɛn na wopɛ sɛ wuhu akyi?.
I will be honest	Mɛka nokware
I just wanted to sleep	Ná mepɛ sɛ meda kɛkɛ
This only exacerbates the situation.	Eyi ma tebea no mu yɛ den ara kwa.
He would go himself.	Ná ɔno ankasa bɛkɔ.
You are working again.	Woreyɛ adwuma bio.
That number will be real and true.	Saa dodow no bɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa na ɛyɛ nokware.
Not great, but it would be fine, he told himself.	Ɛnyɛ kɛse, nanso ɛbɛyɛ yiye, ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho.
Very fast and strong.	Ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm yiye na ɛyɛ den.
That was easy.	Ná ɛno yɛ mmerɛw.
This was a real thing.	Ná eyi yɛ ade ankasa.
I disagree with that	Me ne saa asɛm no nyɛ adwene
A better school, maybe.	Sukuu a eye sen saa, ebia.
Good night moon.	Anadwo pa ɔsram.
What should you do?.	Dɛn na ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ?.
That’s one thing.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm biako.
I felt at home very quickly	Metee nka sɛ mewɔ fie ntɛmntɛm paa
That wasn’t necessary.	Ná ɛno ho nhia.
Lie down for a few days.	Da fam nna kakraa bi.
We are in big trouble here.	Yɛwɔ ɔhaw kɛse mu wɔ ha.
That could happen later.	Ɛno betumi aba akyiri yi.
I really need to go home	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ fie ankasa
We can’t go out there.	Yɛrentumi nkɔ abɔnten hɔ.
No one really did that.	Obiara anyɛ saa ankasa.
I'm not sure what you mean about animals though.	Me nnim nea wopɛ sɛ woka wɔ mmoa ho de, nanso.
This went on for at least a year.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, eyi kɔɔ so afe biako.
I want to know everything about him	Mepɛ sɛ mihu ne ho biribiara
I’m very, very impressed	M’ani gye ho paa paa
He knows these plans.	Onim nhyehyɛe ahorow yi.
I was sent to prison	Wɔde me kɔɔ afiase
He pointed to the door with his other hand.	Ɔde ne nsa foforo no kyerɛɛ ɔpon no.
I can’t see how we can help with that	Mintumi nhu sɛnea yebetumi aboa wɔ saa asɛm no ho
I felt completely powerless	Metee nka sɛ minni tumi koraa
He knew this was very important.	Ná onim sɛ eyi ho hia paa.
I could certainly relate	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na metumi aka ho asɛm
While that.	Bere a ɛno.
I really didn’t want to know	Ankasa na mempɛ sɛ mihu
I heard the whole story	Metee asɛm no nyinaa
I can barely see.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ m’ani ntumi nhu ade.
Think about the same for a moment.	Susuw saa ara ho kakra.
I usually end with this thing.	Mpɛn pii no, mede saa ade yi ba awiei.
Australia won the game	Australia dii nkonim wɔ agoru no mu
It’s not a mistake.	Ɛnyɛ mfomso.
I'm really sorry about that, you know	Mepa wo kyɛw ankasa wɔ saa asɛm no ho, wunim
But that’s all over with.	Nanso ɛno nyinaa aba awiei wɔ.
It’s not much.	Ɛnyɛ pii.
I would appreciate it if you could help me.	Sɛ wubetumi aboa me a, m’ani begye.
My mind was blown away.	M’adwene yɛɛ me hyew.
Something bad, even.	Biribi bɔne, mpo.
He wasn’t weak.	Ná ɔnyɛ mmerɛw.
It was an evening thing.	Ná ɛyɛ anwummere ade.
I love this job.	M’ani gye adwuma yi ho.
I know the truth anyway	Minim nokware no wɔ ɔkwan biara so
I just can’t think of things like that	Mintumi nsusuw nneɛma a ɛte saa ho kɛkɛ
I will drive one of them	Mede wɔn mu biako bɛka kar
This is for two reasons.	Eyi yɛ nneɛma abien nti.
Everything had been a lie.	Ná biribiara ayɛ atoro.
His first letter was in the paper the next day.	Ne krataa a edi kan no wɔ krataa no mu da a edi hɔ no.
There are many types of lies.	Atoro ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
He has my hair.	Ɔwɔ me ti nhwi.
I really want to do this	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi ankasa
I still wanted to know more.	Ná meda so ara pɛ sɛ mihu pii.
And he knew it.	Na na onim.
I do this for them too, you know.	Meyɛ eyi ma wɔn nso, wunim.
I immediately knew where we were	Mihuu baabi a yɛwɔ ntɛm ara
Sure, language is cheap.	Ampa, kasa yɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den.
Maybe he was being too hard on her.	Ebia na ɔreyɛ den dodo ama no.
It will work well indeed.	Ɛbɛyɛ adwuma yiye ampa.
It doesn’t matter how much people look like.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse sɛnea nkurɔfo te.
It hurts to the core.	Ɛyɛ me yaw kosi me mu.
I'm sure yours isn't.	Migye di sɛ wo de no nyɛ saa.
We have to bring them.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde wɔn ba.
I'm telling him.	Meka no.
Something bad was going to happen.	Ná biribi bɔne bi bɛba.
No one came home.	Obiara amma fie.
In the end, I did well	Awiei koraa no, meyɛɛ no ​​yiye
It’s old stuff.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma dedaw a wɔde yɛ adwuma.
When no one else is involved.	Bere a obi foforo biara nka ho.
I believe this is a good thing.	Migye di sɛ eyi yɛ ade pa.
He must must be like me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ te sɛ me.
I can’t believe this	Mintumi nnye eyi nni
A month later.	Ɔsram biako akyi.
I have been with you for a long time.	Me ne mo akyɛ.
Or something.	Anaasɛ biribi.
And it’s cheaper.	Na ɛyɛ nea ne bo yɛ mmerɛw.
Not because of the money.	Ɛnyɛ sika no nti.
I felt committed to you	Metee nka sɛ mede me ho ama wo
If anyone knows of a good thing, I’d appreciate it.	Sɛ obi nim ade pa bi a, m’ani begye ho.
I didn’t want to do it in a group	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ no kuw bi mu
I hope you can come here	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi aba ha
My hair was full	Ná me ti nhwi ayɛ ma
The one who does the action.	Nea ɔyɛ ade.
I don’t have any information	Minni nsɛm biara
I would do anything to get her back	Ná mɛyɛ biribiara de anya no bio
I was also in awe of his powers of observation	Ná me ho dwiriw me nso wɔ tumi a ɔde hwɛ ade no ho
And we can’t do that either.	Na ɛno nso yɛrentumi nyɛ.
I decided to join them there	Meyɛɛ m’adwene sɛ mɛka wɔn ho wɔ hɔ
I had never forgotten	Ná me werɛ mfi da
I know how much you want this	Minim sɛnea wopɛ eyi kɛse
This is not the case here.	Eyi nte saa wɔ ha.
I kind of liked this.	M’ani gyee eyi ho wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
And if that makes me a bad person.	Na sɛ ɛno ma meyɛ onipa bɔne a.
I love it here with you	M’ani gye ho wɔ ha ne wo
It does the same job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma koro no ara.
I wanted the other guy	Ná mepɛ ɔbarima foforo no
I can't begin to see that	Mintumi mfi ase nhu saa
One was his own.	Ná biako ne ne de.
I know what happened	Minim nea esii
At least those of this variety.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, wɔn a wɔyɛ saa ahorow yi.
I stiffened as his hands drew closer	Meyɛɛ den bere a ne nsa bɛn no kɛse no
Put him on the bed.	Fa no to mpa so.
Go anywhere but here.	Kɔ baabi foforo biara gye ha.
I don't know if it still works or not	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛda so ara yɛ adwuma anaasɛ ɛnte saa
So there’s that.	Enti ɛno wɔ hɔ.
I know his house.	Minim ne fie.
I told him for at least two hours	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, meka kyerɛɛ no ​​nnɔnhwerew abien
It is both beautiful and functional.	Ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ adwuma nso.
Effective use of photography.	Mfonini a wɔde di dwuma yiye.
We could go to dinner or something.	Yebetumi akɔ anwummere aduan anaa biribi a ɛte saa.
Add more water, if needed.	Fa nsu pii ka ho, sɛ ɛho hia a.
It will be exciting.	Ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
I think the girl must be one or two	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ abeawa no bɛyɛ biako anaa baanu
I heard about it all	Metee ne nyinaa ho asɛm
I still believe that.	Meda so ara gye di saa.
But tell me more about it.	Nanso ka ho nsɛm pii kyerɛ me.
I forget what is there now, if anything	Me werɛ fi nea ɛwɔ hɔ mprempren, sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a
But there had to be a way.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔkwan bi wɔ hɔ.
I was strong in his arms	Ná meyɛ den wɔ ne nsa so
I know the story very well.	Minim asɛm no yiye.
Maybe you’ll be happy.	Ebia w’ani begye.
I love being here.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mewɔ ha.
There was a lot at stake for everyone.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ asiane mu ma obiara.
I don’t know what happened.	Minnim nea esii.
I just didn't know why.	Ná minnim nea enti a ɛte saa ara kɛkɛ.
Put this on the bed.	Fa eyi to mpa so.
It’s not easy at all.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
A bed, sleep.	Mpa bi, nna.
You are in your plan.	Wowɔ wo nhyehyɛe mu.
It’s a real game.	Ɛyɛ agoru ankasa.
After a while, they are all the same.	Bere bi akyi no, wɔn nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
I want to hear everything	Mepɛ sɛ mete biribiara
There is only a cargo container.	Ade a wɔde fa nneɛma nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
They work full time and work long hours.	Wɔde bere nyinaa yɛ adwuma na wɔde nnɔnhwerew pii yɛ adwuma.
I thought we were friends	Ná misusuw sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo
I thought it was a statement	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ asɛm bi a wɔka
Nothing exists but will, even me.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛwɔ hɔ gye sɛ ɔpɛ, me mpo.
Look at this group.	Hwɛ saa kuw yi.
I have worked for you to do.	Mayɛ adwuma ama wo sɛ yɛ.
I have to do what’s best for me, you know	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nea eye ma me, wunim
There was something about it that he didn’t like.	Na biribi wɔ ho a n’ani nnye ho.
This is perfect for him.	Eyi yɛ pɛ ma no.
Money is a language.	Sika yɛ kasa.
However, I don’t need to understand	Nanso, enhia sɛ mete ase
I think that might be true in my situation	Misusuw sɛ ebia ɛno bɛyɛ nokware wɔ me tebea no mu
I had no idea what had gotten into him	Ná minnim nea akɔ ne mu no ho adwene biara
It feels like work.	Ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
This, right here.	Eyi, ha yi ara.
Or maybe they do.	Anaasɛ ebia wɔyɛ saa.
I wanted to do these things	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa nneɛma yi
I did it all for you	Meyɛɛ ne nyinaa maa wo
However, you have done well.	Nanso, woayɛ no yiye.
Part of you saw it	Wo fã bi huu no
There was nothing wrong with these words.	Ná asɛm biara nni saa nsɛm yi mu.
I thought maybe everything would be okay	Misusuwii sɛ ebia biribiara bɛyɛ yiye
I understand that point.	Mete saa asɛm no ase.
I am late for the book.	Meka akyi wɔ nhoma no ho.
I didn’t want to hear this	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete eyi
That really bothers us.	Ɛno haw yɛn ankasa.
But it’s more complicated than that.	Nanso ɛyɛ den sen saa.
But it didn’t work out that way.	Nanso anyɛ yiye saa.
I look at him as my dog	Mehwɛ no sɛ me kraman
They were terrible.	Ná wɔyɛ hu.
I can't deal with that right now	Mintumi nni saa asɛm no ho dwuma mprempren
I believe he doesn’t work.	Migye di sɛ ɔnyɛ adwuma.
And let me just do it this way.	Na ma menyɛ no saa kwan yi so ara kwa.
Take care of it.	Hwɛ so yiye.
Use the complete method.	Fa ɔkwan a edi mũ no di dwuma.
There may be more issues.	Ebia nsɛm pii bɛba.
I realize I love you	Mihu sɛ mepɛ wo
I wanted more from you	Ná mepɛ pii fi wo hɔ
I wonder if we can do it	Misusuw sɛ ebia yebetumi ayɛ anaa
It just isn’t that.	Ɛnyɛ saa ara kwa.
However, this did not happen.	Nanso, eyi amma.
Do whatever you have to do.	Yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biara.
I bring him right away.	Mede no ba ntɛm ara.
We can be our very best condition.	Yebetumi ayɛ yɛn tebea pa ankasa.
You have to tell me the truth.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka nokware no kyerɛ me.
Get rid of the mistake.	Fa wo ho fi mfomso no ho.
I want to see him at work	Mepɛ sɛ mihu no wɔ adwumam
And look at that story.	Na hwɛ saa asɛm no.
It’s easiest that way.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw sen biara saa.
I have to take care of it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ no yiye.
I loved the job.	Ná m’ani gye adwuma no ho.
That is just part of how our minds remember things.	Ɛno yɛ sɛnea yɛn adwene kae nneɛma no fã bi kɛkɛ.
He just tells the truth.	Ɔka nokware no ara kwa.
It is only used for argument.	Wɔde gye akyinnye nkutoo.
You need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
This time he would do everything right.	Saa bere yi de na ɔbɛyɛ biribiara yiye.
Or, they should be a good team.	Anaasɛ, ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ kuw pa.
I know everything now.	Minim biribiara mprempren.
I can’t seem to figure out what’s going on	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nhu nea ɛrekɔ so no
I didn’t know what else to do.	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ bio.
You can time this so that your dog goes home.	Wubetumi ayɛ eyi bere sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wo kraman no bɛkɔ fie.
I want to do what he wants me to do	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nea ɔpɛ sɛ meyɛ
I knew this thing was too old and fragile	Ná minim sɛ saa ade yi akyɛ dodo na ɛyɛ mmerɛw
But he didn't want to give it to her.	Nanso na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔde bɛma no.
I just can’t believe it	Mintumi nnye nni kɛkɛ
I had no problem with that	Ná minni ɔhaw biara wɔ saa asɛm no ho
I could have used him	Anka metumi de no adi dwuma
He just forgot about it here.	Ne werɛ fii no wɔ ha ara kwa.
If this method is used in an experiment.	Sɛ wɔde saa kwan yi di dwuma wɔ sɔhwɛ bi mu a.
So few of us are now.	Enti yɛn mu kakraa bi na yɛwɔ hɔ mprempren.
Assume the system is identical.	Fa no sɛ nhyehyɛe no yɛ pɛ.
He was amazing.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa.
I don’t like the way it looks either.	M’ani nnye sɛnea ɛte no nso ho.
I wanted to make authentic music	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nnwom a ɛyɛ nokware
Maybe that was hopeful language.	Ebia na ɛno yɛ anidaso kasa.
I have an idea of ​​what real evil is	Mewɔ nea bɔne ankasa yɛ ho adwene
But it was only temporary.	Nanso na ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi pɛ.
I should have stayed with him	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no tra
I have done a lot today.	Mayɛ pii nnɛ.
And not too much, or too little.	Na ɛnyɛ pii dodo, anaasɛ ɛnyɛ kakraa bi dodo.
I have no idea what happened.	Minnim nea esii no ho adwene biara.
But we can.	Nanso yebetumi.
And nothing too dangerous	Na biribiara nni hɔ a asiane wom dodo
It has made him much stronger.	Ama ne ho ayɛ den kɛse.
I hope you all can see that now	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo nyinaa betumi ahu saa mprempren
I thank him, and he says no problem	Meda no ase, na ɔka sɛ ɔhaw biara nni ho
I think it’s an important and important thing to do.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ ade a ɛho hia na ɛho hia sɛ wɔyɛ.
Seems a lot of the same to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa ara pii wɔ me fam.
I feel like a real man now.	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ ɔbarima ankasa mprempren.
This situation turns out to be more positive.	Saa tebea yi dan nea eye kɛse.
Just a normal man.	Ɔbarima a ɔte ase kɛkɛ.
He doesn’t do that too much.	Ɔnyɛ saa dodo.
Not even my mother.	Ɛnyɛ me maame mpo.
Believe me.	Gye me di.
A lot of people just never hear about it	Nnipa pii nte ho asɛm da kɛkɛ
It’s way too old.	Ɛyɛ ɔkwan a akyɛ dodo.
He’s very, very bad.	Ɔyɛ bɔne paa, paa.
In any case.	Wɔ ɔkwan biara so.
I didn’t know what to think	Ná minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho
I think he will be fine	Misusuw sɛ ne ho bɛtɔ no
It’s not a big deal to them.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse biara mma wɔn.
But it will be so.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I cannot allow that to happen	Mintumi mma kwan mma ɛnyɛ saa
Not for the most part.	Ɛnyɛ fã kɛse no ara.
However, that doesn’t matter.	Nanso, ɛno mfa ho.
Let him want more.	Ma ɔmpɛ pii.
I like to talk about ‘hope’.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛka ‘anidaso’ ho asɛm.
I told him that he shouldn't	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa
Hope to work on this project again sometime really soon.	Anidaso sɛ wobɛyɛ adwuma wɔ saa adwuma yi ho bio bere bi ankasa nnansa yi ara.
I didn't really care as much as I used to though.	Na ɛnyɛ me asɛm ankasa sɛnea na ɛte kan no nanso.
Time was hard.	Ná bere yɛ den.
Eventually, he recovered	Awiei koraa no, ne ho tɔɔ no
We did that for a year.	Yɛde afe biako yɛɛ saa.
Hard or easy.	Ɛyɛ den anaasɛ ɛnyɛ den.
Maybe you’re terrible.	Ebia wo ho yɛ hu.
Everyone wants one.	Obiara pɛ bi.
I saw myself, but it wasn’t really me	Mihuu me ho, nanso na ɛnyɛ me ankasa
He did this, she did that.	Ɔyɛɛ eyi, ɔno nso yɛɛ saa.
If anyone can find a good one.	Sɛ obi betumi anya bi a eye a.
First of all, they are stronger.	Nea edi kan koraa no, wɔyɛ den sen saa.
That doesn’t mean it’s good.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ ɛyɛ papa.
I really didn’t want anything like that to happen	Ankasa na mempɛ sɛ biribi a ɛte saa bɛkɔ so
He wasn’t there.	Ná onni hɔ.
To make ourselves better.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a yɛn ho bɛyɛ yiye.
Even then I knew.	Saa bere no mpo na minim.
I need to talk to you about something	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa fa biribi ho
Just like the picture below.	Te sɛ mfonini a ɛwɔ ase hɔ no ara pɛ.
Just fun to do.	Anigye kɛkɛ sɛ wobɛyɛ.
I hadn’t thought of this	Ná minsusuw eyi ho
Everyone inside was one of them.	Ná obiara a ɔwɔ mu no yɛ wɔn mu biako.
Maybe that was true.	Ebia na ɛno yɛ nokware.
I think that’s the important thing now	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne ade a ɛho hia mprempren
It will be	Ɛbɛyɛ .
You have to be strong for him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ den ma no.
I can’t believe he’s here	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɔwɔ ha
They were friends.	Ná wɔyɛ nnamfo.
And you were part of that.	Na na woyɛ saa asɛm no fã.
I wasn’t always like that	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na na mete saa
There is just one thing.	Biako kɛkɛ ne sɛ.
This is beautiful and interesting.	Eyi yɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ anigye.
The same is true for me.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ me fam.
I also like your walking shoes	M’ani gye wo nantew mpaboa nso ho
It’s good for them.	Ɛyɛ papa ma wɔn.
I need to get into it a bit.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ mu kakra.
I knew nothing about him at the time	Ná minnim ne ho hwee saa bere no
House in excellent condition.	Ofie a ɛwɔ tebea pa mu.
I am still working on it.	Meda so ara reyɛ ho adwuma.
I think he feels the same way about me	Misusuw sɛ ɔte nka saa ara wɔ me ho
I put in my information.	Mede me ho nsɛm hyɛɛ mu.
That is absolutely essential.	Ɛno ho hia koraa.
Why are we not surprised?.	Dɛn nti na ɛnyɛ yɛn nwonwa?.
I could just stare at it all day	Ná metumi ahwɛ no da mũ nyinaa kɛkɛ
Don’t be too quick.	Mma ɛnyɛ ntɛm dodo.
You can’t make a little more money.	Worentumi nnya sika kakra bio.
None of them had heard of him.	Ná wɔn mu biara nte ne ho asɛm.
However, he wanted to.	Nanso, na ɔpɛ.
But its very difficult.	Nanso ne den yiye.
I didn’t know him, and he didn’t know me	Ná minnim no, na na onnim me nso
I have problems quite similar to this.	Mewɔ ɔhaw ahorow a ɛte sɛ eyi koraa.
That in itself, is good.	Ɛno ankasa, ɛyɛ papa.
I also felt like I had done something wonderful	Metee nka nso sɛ mayɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa
That worked just as well.	Ɛno nso yɛɛ adwuma yiye saa ara.
Just go for it.	Kɔ ara kwa.
He didn't know what to say.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛka.
I can’t take it anymore	Mintumi mfa no bio
I’m in love with him.	M’ani gye ne ho.
I was shocked, but not surprised that he has	Me ho dwiriw me, nanso ɛnyɛ me nwonwa sɛ wayɛ saa
Maybe some good would come out of all that had happened.	Ebia na nneɛma pa bi bɛba afi nea asi nyinaa mu.
The bed can do the same.	Mpa no nso betumi ayɛ saa.
It was pretty good.	Ná ɛyɛ papa yiye.
They don’t need to be touched.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa ka.
I have some things I need to work on	Mewɔ nneɛma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ho adwuma
The road behind it.	Ɔkwan a ɛwɔ akyi no.
And it would be a big mistake.	Na ɛbɛyɛ mfomso kɛse.
And he doesn’t really.	Na ɔnyɛ saa ankasa.
Anyway, I was relieved	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, me ho tɔɔ me
I think you’ll like them.	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye wɔn ho.
I couldn’t even keep water down	Ná mintumi mma nsu nkɔ fam mpo
I am not alone in saying that I am troubled by that situation	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na meka sɛ saa tebea no haw me
I wanted you to see something else	Ná mepɛ sɛ wuhu biribi foforo
That money is gone now.	Saa sika no nni hɔ bio mprempren.
I see it like no one else does	Mihu no te sɛ nea obi foforo biara nhu no
He is a person who.	Ɔyɛ obi a.
That to me is the interesting point.	Ɛno ma me ne asɛm a ɛyɛ anigye no.
Another time he would have touched me.	Bere foforo mu no anka ɔde ne nsa bɛka me.
He is definitely not normal, and he knows too much about me.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔnyɛ obi a ɔte ase, na onim me ho nsɛm pii dodo.
It’s not really true.	Ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa.
I couldn’t understand what had happened	Ná mintumi nte nea asi no ase
He was not what he seemed.	Ná ɔnyɛ nea na ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ no.
And you’re hard on yourself when you’re not.	Na wo ho yɛ den wɔ wo ho bere a wonyɛ saa no.
I can't tell you a word	Mintumi nka asɛm biako mpo nkyerɛ wo
However, there are many factors to consider.	Nanso, nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
Still, I enjoyed hearing it	Nanso, m’ani gyee ho sɛ metee no
A very beautiful thing.	Ade a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
We need to do more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ pii.
Not very exciting	Ɛnyɛ anigye kɛse
There would be time for it later.	Ná bere bɛba ama no akyiri yi.
And everyone does that.	Na obiara yɛ saa.
I did have a different perspective	Ná mewɔ adwene foforo ampa
It had to feel authentic.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
Another good thing	Ade foforo a eye
As far as he knew, it always was.	Sɛnea na onim no, ɛyɛ bere nyinaa.
I want a girl though	Mepɛ abeawa bi de, nanso
Their power was not great, but it was real.	Ná wɔn tumi no nyɛ kɛse, nanso na ɛyɛ ankasa.
Here is how it is used now.	Sɛnea wɔde di dwuma mprempren ni.
I was just so overwhelmed	Ná me ho ayɛ me den saa ara kwa
That’s how bad it is.	Saa na ɛyɛ bɔne.
I can take him down that way.	Metumi de no akɔ fam saa kwan no so.
All items must be in good condition.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma nyinaa yɛ nea ɛwɔ tebea pa mu.
I’m very impressed with them.	M’ani agye wɔn ho kɛse.
I’m really happy for you	M’ani agye ankasa ma wo
I just didn’t realize how great it was, though	Nanso, na minnim sɛnea ɛyɛ kɛse no ara kwa
There must be more.	Ɛsɛ sɛ pii wɔ hɔ.
I told you this morning	Meka kyerɛɛ mo saa anɔpa yi
I have to be like everyone else	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ sɛ obiara
I am very interested in working on your project.	M’ani gye ho kɛse sɛ mɛyɛ wo adwuma no ho adwuma.
I have even packed most of my stuff	Mede me nneɛma dodow no ara mpo ahyɛ mu ma
Now that he is gone, there is so much more for me to do.	Seesei a onni hɔ bio no, pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
Maybe he'll tell everyone.	Ebia ɔbɛka akyerɛ obiara.
No one knew his real name.	Ná obiara nnim ne din ankasa.
I nodded to myself.	Mede me ti too fam kyerɛɛ me ho.
I really think he is the one	Misusuw ankasa sɛ ɔno ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ no
I wanted him to say something	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔka biribi
I wanted it to be hard, strong, fast	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den, ɛyɛ den, ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm
I thought about it.	Misusuw ho.
I still didn’t even have a car	Ná meda so ara nni kar mpo
There were many reasons for this.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
There were only about two people left	Ná nnipa bɛyɛ baanu pɛ na aka
I thoroughly enjoyed everything	M’ani gyee biribiara ho yiye
She never wanted to be anyone else as a girl.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ obi foforo da sɛ abeawa.
That would be ideal.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
I talk to my mom almost every day	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ me ne me maame kasa da biara
I just think this song goes well with him.	Misusuw kɛkɛ sɛ dwom yi ne no kɔ yiye.
It was just the two of us this morning.	Na ɛyɛ yɛn baanu nkutoo anɔpa yi.
I want to do better here	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nea eye wɔ ha
That is absolutely their right.	Ɛno ne wɔn hokwan koraa.
But they didn’t have to.	Nanso na ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I love giving a whole lot of goodies to a new home	M’ani gye ho sɛ mede nneɛma pa a edi mũ bɛma ofie foforo
You must be an absolute monster.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ aboa kɛse koraa.
No one had much money.	Ná obiara nni sika pii.
I told you it was good	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ ɛyɛ papa
I couldn’t have been there sooner	Anka mintumi nkɔ hɔ ntɛm
But that moment never came.	Nanso saa bere no amma da.
This is a simple transfer.	Eyi yɛ ade a wɔde kɔ baabi foforo a ɛnyɛ den.
I wrapped my arms around her	Mede me nsa bɔɔ ne mu
But this would be too fast.	Nanso na eyi bɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
I know the pictures don’t really look like anything to me.	Minim sɛ mfonini ahorow no nte sɛ biribiara ankasa mma me.
The dog was there.	Ná ɔkraman no wɔ hɔ.
My wife can’t say enough about it.	Me yere ntumi nka ho asɛm a ɛdɔɔso.
However, I didn’t have one either	Nanso, na minni bi nso
I didn’t want to take them	Ná mempɛ sɛ mede wɔn bɛkɔ
I can take care of myself quite well	Metumi ahwɛ me ho yiye koraa
This was a house owned by people.	Ná eyi yɛ ofie a nkurɔfo wɔ.
Something terrible has happened.	Biribi a ɛyɛ hu asi.
At least their clothes were still on, somehow.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na wɔn ntade da so ara hyɛ, ɔkwan bi so.
It is given here.	Wɔde ama wɔ ha.
Either way, you have to do the thing.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ ade no.
You have one year.	Wowɔ afe biako.
It just gets old to me.	Ɛyɛ dedaw ma me ara kwa.
I want to travel to the city with you today	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo tu kwan kɔ kurow no mu nnɛ
This is a two-song.	Eyi yɛ dwom abien.
Offering you a job, if you will	Adwuma a wɔde bɛma wo, sɛ wopɛ a
I had to do that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
Later he played with them	Akyiri yi ɔne wɔn dii agoru
That’s my day job.	Ɛno ne me da adwuma.
It doesn’t work for me.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma mma me.
It’s quite simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
I just can’t think in that way	Mintumi nsusuw nneɛma ho wɔ saa kwan no so kɛkɛ
I didn't know how to proceed	Ná minnim sɛnea mɛkɔ so ayɛ saa
He wasn't doing that now.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa mprempren.
I think you will be fine.	Misusuw sɛ wo ho bɛtɔ wo.
I felt like myself	Ná mete nka sɛ me ho
His father as it is.	Ne papa sɛnea ɛte no.
I didn’t want to take risks	Ná mempɛ sɛ mede me ho to asiane mu
I don’t want to know if he’s the best for me.	Mempɛ sɛ mihu sɛ ebia ɔno na eye ma me anaa.
Less is always more.	Kakraa yɛ pii bere nyinaa.
You know good and well that is not the way.	Wunim papa ne yiye sɛ ɛnyɛ ɔkwan a ɛte saa.
He can put it down more now.	Obetumi de ahyɛ fam kɛse mprempren.
At least he was tall.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ne tenten yɛ.
I really gave this a try.	Mede eyi bɔɔ mmɔden ankasa.
He was at work now.	Na ɔwɔ adwuma mu mprempren.
I knew this wasn’t going anywhere good	Na minim sɛ eyi nkɔ baabi pa biara
It’s what you do with it that counts.	Ɛyɛ nea wode yɛ no na ɛho hia.
That way, people want to talk about it.	Saa kwan no so no, nkurɔfo pɛ sɛ wɔka ho asɛm.
I didn’t really know what it was	Ná minnim nea ɛyɛ ankasa
We are all free people.	Yɛn nyinaa yɛ nnipa a yɛde wɔn ho.
But once it was something else.	Nanso bere bi na ɛyɛ biribi foforo.
We can do all these wonderful things.	Yebetumi ayɛ saa nneɛma a ɛyɛ nwonwa yi nyinaa.
I didn’t like him.	Ná m’ani nnye ne ho.
I can’t keep lying to him	Mintumi nkɔ so nni atoro nkyerɛ no
You know these things.	Wunim saa nneɛma yi.
But nothing like what is happening now.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ nea ɛrekɔ so mprempren no.
I’ve always admired you	M’ani gye wo ho bere nyinaa
I believe you can do it.	Migye di sɛ wubetumi ayɛ.
I can’t take anything anymore	Mintumi nnye hwee bio
Well, he knew it wasn’t him.	Eye, na onim sɛ ɛnyɛ ɔno.
Maybe you have a story to tell.	Ebia wowɔ asɛm bi a wopɛ sɛ woka.
I know there are many varieties	Minim sɛ ne ahorow pii wɔ hɔ
It will be good for them.	Ɛbɛyɛ nea eye ma wɔn.
Those kinds of things.	Saa nneɛma ahorow no.
From time to time.	Bere ne bere mu.
Look and see.	Hwɛ na hwɛ.
Everyone else tries to match.	Obiara a aka no bɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔne no bɛyɛ pɛ.
Not much is known at this time	Nneɛma pii nnim saa bere yi
Production is too expensive.	Nneɛma a wɔyɛ no bo yɛ den dodo.
I sketched it out.	Meyɛɛ ho mfonini.
I'm the only one who thinks about it	Me nkutoo na misusuw ho
Therefore, he was the same.	Ɛno nti, na ɔno nso te saa ara.
One way or another they do.	Ɔkwan bi so anaa ɔkwan foforo so na wɔyɛ.
It was devoid of people.	Ná ɛyɛ nea nnipa nni mu.
Maybe he made friends with her.	Ebia ɔne no faa nnamfo.
And yet, it’s not entirely out of the question.	Na nanso, ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ asɛm no mu koraa.
I can't argue with that	Mintumi ne saa asɛm no nnye akyinnye
Time is nothing.	Bere nyɛ hwee.
Anything, anything, good can happen now.	Biribiara, biribiara, papa betumi asi mprempren.
More about me here.	Me ho nsɛm pii wɔ ha.
Everything is over.	Biribiara aba awiei.
And besides, we have each other now, too.	Na ɛno da nkyɛn a, yɛwɔ yɛn ho yɛn ho mprempren, nso.
I couldn’t let my power go with it	Na mintumi mma me tumi no ne no nkɔ
It just wasn’t working for me.	Na ɛnyɛ adwuma mma me kɛkɛ.
I could just move	Ná metumi atu kɛkɛ
I was there last night.	Na mewɔ hɔ anadwo a etwaam no.
I have plenty of extra space here	Mewɔ baabi foforo pii wɔ ha
I told my mom too	Meka kyerɛɛ me maame nso
This will be a real game.	Eyi bɛyɛ agoru ankasa.
I guess it wasn’t a great idea	Misusuw sɛ na ɛnyɛ adwene kɛse
Hope your day is going well.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ wo da no rekɔ yiye.
It was a wonderful day.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I couldn’t tell how many.	Na mintumi nhu dodow ahe.
The same would be true of us.	Saa ara na anka yɛn nso yɛbɛyɛ.
I was doing this.	Ná mereyɛ eyi.
I was doing too much.	Ná mereyɛ nneɛma pii dodo.
The most important thing was that the project got started.	Nea na ɛho hia sen biara ne sɛ adwuma no fii ase.
I would have thought he would have done something else	Anka misusuw sɛ anka ɔbɛyɛ biribi foforo
Every other option has always been problematic.	Ɔkwan foforo biara ayɛ ɔhaw bere nyinaa.
It was old-fashioned.	Ná ɛyɛ dedaw.
I don't have time.	Minni bere.
I hope you enjoy it	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho
I think it will be interesting anyway	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ anigye ɔkwan biara so
The strongest among us can do that.	Wɔn a wɔn ho yɛ den sen biara wɔ yɛn mu no tumi yɛ saa.
A lot of people just love it.	Nnipa pii ani gye ho ara kwa.
It’s only been a week.	Ɛyɛ dapɛn biako pɛ.
Good job.	Adwuma pa.
I can't believe you have so much control over this	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ wowɔ tumi kɛse bi wɔ eyi ho
And something else.	Na biribi foforo nso.
I know you already knew this	Minim sɛ na wunim eyi dedaw
I was interested in that.	Ná m’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
I want to think this with you	Mepɛ sɛ misusuw eyi ne wo ho
I wanted to party like everyone else	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ apontow te sɛ obiara
But, I tell you again	Nanso, meka kyerɛ wo bio
There had to be more to it than that.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma pii ka ho sen saa.
Often, though, there was hardly anything left.	Nanso, mpɛn pii no, na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biribiara nni hɔ a aka.
This year, however.	Nanso, afe yi.
He touched her hand.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne nsa.
A truly remarkable story	Asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa ampa
This is not that book.	Eyi nyɛ saa nhoma no.
Many opportunities	Hokwan ahorow pii
He seems to have done both well and good.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛɛ yiye ne papa nyinaa.
If not, I would be surprised.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, ɛbɛyɛ me nwonwa.
He knows everything about us.	Onim yɛn ho biribiara.
It was my fault, not yours.	Na ɛyɛ me mfomso, na ɛnyɛ wo de.
I don't think he is though.	Minsusuw sɛ ɔte saa de.
He was not there this evening.	Na onni hɔ anwummere yi.
I was always so worried about you	Ná wo ho asɛm haw me kɛse bere nyinaa
Many people don’t.	Nnipa pii nyɛ saa.
I was once like you, kid	Bere bi na mete sɛ wo, abofra
Just put it in it.	Fa hyɛ mu kɛkɛ.
I feel so great and awesome.	Mete nka sɛ meyɛ kɛse yiye na meyɛ hu.
I really want to end this	Mepɛ sɛ mede eyi ba awiei ankasa
And this picture too.	Na saa mfonini yi nso.
I want you to think about this for a moment	Mepɛ sɛ wususuw saa asɛm yi ho kakra
Nothing for any of us.	Biribiara nni hɔ mma yɛn mu biara.
The same is true here.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ ha.
It was so much fun when he did.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye kɛse bere a ɔyɛɛ saa no.
I just can’t deal with it	Mintumi ne no nni ho dwuma kɛkɛ
That’s been the case.	Ɛno ayɛ saa.
Not the background.	Ɛnyɛ akyi.
I would have made the time.	Anka mɛyɛ bere no.
For most of them, it was a short drive.	Wɔ wɔn mu dodow no ara fam no, na ɛyɛ kar kwan tiaa bi.
Otherwise, I would be in trouble.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, anka mɛkɔ ɔhaw mu.
I like simple things	M’ani gye nneɛma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ho
I pretty much continue to eat as is.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mekɔ so di sɛnea ɛte no.
He had enough problems.	Ná ɔwɔ ɔhaw ahorow a ɛdɔɔso.
You are working on this book.	Woreyɛ nhoma yi ho adwuma.
You can see where this is going.	Wubetumi ahu baabi a eyi rekɔ.
I was just put in a house.	Wɔde me too ofie bi mu ara kwa.
I know you would anyway	Minim sɛ ɔkwan biara so no anka wobɛyɛ saa
I didn’t know what to do	Ná minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ
I can do that in any movie	Metumi ayɛ saa wɔ sini biara mu
This was a great thing.	Ná eyi yɛ ade kɛse.
I am not doing any of this stuff	Ɛnyɛ me na mereyɛ saa nneɛma yi mu biara
You can give yourself to us.	Wubetumi de yɛn ho ama yɛn.
That’s why it doesn’t work.	Ɛno nti na ɛnyɛ adwuma no.
And it seemed to be.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte.
That, which you can see below.	Ɛno, a wubetumi ahu wɔ ase hɔ no.
I just want to be free	Mepɛ sɛ mede me ho kɛkɛ
He’s a nice guy.	N’ani gyee ne ho.
I nodded only to my father	Mede me ti too fam de kyerɛɛ me papa nkutoo
But now its phone policy is up to date.	Nanso mprempren ne telefon ho nhyehyɛe no yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ nnɛ.
I know his path was much harder	Minim sɛ na ne kwan no yɛ den kɛse
So did we, too.	Saa ara na na yɛn nso yɛyɛ.
I already thought about that	Misusuw saa asɛm no ho dedaw
I know you were both strong.	Minim sɛ na mo baanu nyinaa yɛɛ den.
It’s still here.	Ɛda so ara wɔ ha.
I felt bad, afterwards	Metee nka bɔne, ɛno akyi
Just like food.	Te sɛ aduan ara pɛ.
He plays with you.	Ɔbɔ wo ho agoru.
The same is true of cars.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ kar ho.
Not so fast.	Ɛnyɛ ntɛm saa.
You don’t have to touch them.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wode wo nsa ka wɔn.
I have to keep running	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so tu mmirika
Look at the big picture.	Hwɛ mfonini kɛse no.
He glared at me and tilted his head.	Ɔde n’ani sii me so na ɔde ne nsa kyerɛɛ ne ti so.
One of the best.	Nea eye sen biara no mu biako.
And pictures, too.	Na mfonini ahorow nso.
I ran home	Mede mmirika kɔɔ fie
The days are long.	Nna no yɛ tenten.
But it’s been an interesting week, all the same.	Nanso ɛyɛ dapɛn a ɛyɛ anigye, ne nyinaa yɛ pɛ.
Something wonderful, that.	Biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa, sɛ.
I have to do something.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi.
The problem is the system.	Ɔhaw no ne nhyehyɛe no.
You were a bigger man than I was.	Ná woyɛ ɔbarima kɛse sen me.
I love this story of his	M’ani gye ne asɛm yi ho
I almost fell in love with him then	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ m’ani gyee ne ho saa bere no
Any ideas or plans?.	Adwene anaa nhyehyɛe bi wɔ hɔ?.
Nobody saw it.	Obiara anhu.
Mine are just like them too.	Me de no te sɛ wɔn nso ara pɛ.
I didn’t want this to apply to me	Ná mempɛ sɛ eyi fa me ho
There are many such things.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛte saa.
I looked good, for the most part	Ná me ho yɛ fɛ, wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu
I should have ended it years ago	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mede ba awiei mfe pii a atwam ni
I never really know when that thing will happen	Minnim bere a saa ade no bɛba ankasa da
It was also true.	Ná ɛyɛ nokware nso.
So there really is no right or wrong.	Enti papa anaa bɔne biara nni hɔ ankasa.
These two were close.	Ná saa baanu yi bɛn wɔn ho.
I felt bad for him	Metee nka bɔne ma no
I can’t see how he could have known	Mintumi nhu sɛnea na obetumi ahu
And yet it was too late.	Na nanso na aka akyi dodo.
And it was a good one.	Na ɛyɛ papa.
Enough financial information.	Sika ho nsɛm a ɛdɔɔso.
I feel cold inside and empty	Mete nka sɛ awɔw wom wɔ me mu na hwee nni me ho
No doubt he wants to talk to you.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔpɛ sɛ ɔne wo kasa.
I want to be with him	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no bɔ
However, there was nothing else quite like this at the time.	Nanso, biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ eyi koraa saa bere no.
He had an edge on her.	Ná ɔwɔ ano wɔ ne so.
That time had long passed.	Ná saa bere no atwam akyɛ.
A year had passed.	Ná afe biako atwam.
I think my time is up	Misusuw sɛ me bere aba awiei
We have to do better though.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ yiye nanso.
I saw him many times.	Mihuu no mpɛn pii.
I’d appreciate any ideas.	M’ani begye adwene biara ho.
I love this time of year	M’ani gye afe no mu bere yi ho
This is probably just the weird take on it.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ eyi yɛ ne fa a ɛyɛ nwonwa no ara kwa.
It’s the ending.	Ɛyɛ awiei no.
I was there, but not for the reason you think	Na mewɔ hɔ, nanso ɛnyɛ nea enti a wususuw no nti
Therefore, timing is more important than necessary.	Enti, bere a wɔde bɛbɔ ka no ho hia sen sɛnea ɛho hia.
At that point I was excited	Saa bere no na m’ani agye
That was the only thing he liked about them.	Ɛno nkutoo ne wɔn ho ade a na n’ani gye ho.
I can see something on the bed	Metumi ahu biribi wɔ mpa no so
I need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
I know how to give you these things	Minim sɛnea mede saa nneɛma yi bɛma mo
However, it must be true.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
I think about it, it’s okay	Misusuw ho, ɛyɛ yiye
I just wasn’t that person	Na menyɛ saa onipa no ara kwa
I forgot he was there	Me werɛ fii sɛ na ɔwɔ hɔ
But he could do it.	Nanso na obetumi ayɛ.
This man has come.	Ɔbarima yi aba.
I have no idea what to do about that	Minni adwene biara sɛ mɛyɛ wɔ saa asɛm no ho
Whatever he says after that is generally true.	Biribiara a ɔka wɔ ɛno akyi no, mpɛn pii no, ɛyɛ nokware.
He knew them from his previous jobs and knew they were dangerous.	Ná onim wɔn fi ne nnwuma a atwam no mu na na onim sɛ ɛyɛ hu.
In the best possible way	Wɔ ɔkwan a eye sen biara so
I was the one who did it.	Me na meyɛɛ saa.
Let it be wet.	Ma ɛnyɛ nsu.
All these years.	Mfe yi nyinaa.
He loves to play.	Ɔpɛ agoru.
At that time.	Saa bere no.
Somewhere in the middle of the night.	Baabi wɔ anadwo fã.
It wasn’t too bad.	Ná ɛnyɛ bɔne dodo.
Tell me quickly.	Ka kyerɛ me ntɛm.
I don’t even know where he is.	Minnim baabi a ɔwɔ mpo.
And do it with joy.	Na yɛ no anigye so.
Let’s have a little fun.	Momma yɛn ani nnye ho kakra.
I know you’ll like him.	Minim sɛ w’ani begye ne ho.
Everyone is great.	Obiara yɛ kɛse.
I thought it sounded like a good thing to me	Misusuwii sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ ade pa ma me
He signed the letter.	Ɔde ne nsa hyɛɛ krataa no ase.
I saw it in his eyes	Mihuu no wɔ n’ani so
It may be harder than ever.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ den sen bere biara.
I was a bit of a party girl	Ná meyɛ apontow ase abeawa kakra
There are human rights.	Hokwan ahorow a nnipa wɔ wɔ hɔ.
I ran back to the car	Mede mmirika san kɔɔ kar no ho
There was never enough time.	Ná bere a ɛdɔɔso nni hɔ da.
Maybe there is an opportunity.	Ebia hokwan bi wɔ hɔ.
After this, there is nothing.	Eyi akyi no, biribiara nni hɔ.
Or get rid of it.	Anaasɛ yi wo ho fi mu.
I didn’t have time for that, though	Nanso, na minni bere mma saa
I believe we all want that	Migye di sɛ yɛn nyinaa pɛ saa
He's gone too far with her.	Ɔde ne ho akɔ akyiri dodo ne no.
There were only about two people left.	Ná nnipa bɛyɛ baanu pɛ na aka.
This is after years of trying.	Eyi yɛ bere a wɔde mfe pii abɔ mmɔden akyi.
I’m in a good mood.	M’adwene yɛ me yiye.
I did the rest.	Meyɛɛ nea aka no.
I guess it wasn’t that bad	Misusuw sɛ na ɛnyɛ bɔne saa
On weekends, mostly.	Wɔ dapɛn awiei no, dodow no ara.
I provide information	Mede nsɛm ma
I have my name to think about	Mewɔ me din a ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho
I leaned against him.	Mede me ho too ne nkyɛn.
Add another day to it.	Fa da foforo ka ho.
Sounds like a great time.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ bere kɛse.
Nothing terribly dramatic here	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛyɛ hu wɔ ha
I hope my mom gets better.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ me maame ho bɛtɔ no.
I don’t even know about myself.	Me nnim me ho asɛm mpo.
I will be good too	Me nso mɛyɛ papa
This was not my habit	Ná eyi nyɛ me su
You can do some more work on it later.	Wubetumi ayɛ ho adwuma bi bio akyiri yi.
They both loved to have fun.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa ani gye anigye ho.
This whole thing is pretty amazing.	Saa ade yi nyinaa yɛ nwonwa yiye.
You can see that it will.	Wubetumi ahu sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I thought about saying that	Misusuw ho sɛ mɛka saa
This would be amazing.	Eyi bɛyɛ nwonwa.
I think that’s impossible	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye
I think they are very cute and pretty too	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ fɛ yiye na wɔn ho yɛ fɛ nso
I wasn’t familiar with his music	Ná minnim ne nnwom no yiye
There is no real intention.	Adwene ankasa biara nni mu.
Behind them the road began.	Wɔn akyi no, ɔkwan no fii ase.
I do that all the time, and I stay busy	Meyɛ saa bere nyinaa, na mekɔ so yɛ adagyew
Everything was wet.	Ná biribiara ayɛ nsu.
I don’t know if that’s a bad thing	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno yɛ ade bɔne anaa
Any help would be appreciated.	Mmoa biara a wɔde bɛma no, yɛn ani begye ho.
All of those things are important.	Saa nneɛma no nyinaa ho hia.
I focused on the power	Mede m’adwene sii tumi no so
And so does he.	Na saa ara na ɔyɛ.
The music comes out well	Nnwom no fi adi yiye
I am willing to give you a job here	Mewɔ ɔpɛ sɛ mede adwuma bɛma wo wɔ ha
I had some privileges	Ná mewɔ hokwan ahorow bi
It wasn’t me, certainly.	Na ɛnyɛ me, akyinnye biara nni ho.
It has elements of the old and the new	Ɛwɔ dedaw ne foforo no mu nneɛma bi
Glad you’re interested.	Anigye sɛ w’ani gye ho.
I know you want that	Minim sɛ wopɛ saa
I feel the same way.	Me nso mete nka saa ara.
I can't really add much	Mintumi mfa pii nka ho ankasa
If only it were that simple.	Sɛ anka ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa a.
I hope you enjoy it	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho
I can’t imagine otherwise.	Mintumi nsusuw ho sɛ ɛnte saa.
I still talk to him.	Meda so ara kasa kyerɛ no.
All of this is there.	Eyi nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
I want you to see him	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu no
Part of it.	Ne fã bi.
I love that song so much	M’ani gye saa dwom no ho saa
He doesn’t know the language.	Onnim kasa no.
I got it right here.	Me nyaa no wɔ ha yi ara.
Someone uses them to watch.	Obi de wɔn di dwuma de hwɛ.
Only you can know that.	Wo nkutoo na wubetumi ahu saa.
That time is now and it is here.	Saa bere no yɛ mprempren na ɛwɔ ha.
I need to think of something	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw biribi ho
I was still very young	Ná meda so ara yɛ abofra koraa
It felt like nothing.	Ná ɛte nka sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
But that’s kind of beside the point.	Nanso ɛno yɛ ɔkwan bi so a ɛwɔ asɛm no nkyɛn.
I want to know.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu.
She was perfect for her new one.	Ná ɔyɛ pɛ ma ne foforo no.
This is just part of it.	Eyi yɛ ne fã bi kɛkɛ.
I had to talk to someone about it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ me ne obi ka ho asɛm.
It doesn’t happen anymore.	Ɛnyɛ bio.
I wanted to go there	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ
And that will continue to be the case	Na ɛno bɛkɔ so ayɛ saa
I guess it doesn’t work that way	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ adwuma saa
I did like him, a lot	Meyɛɛ te sɛ ɔno, pii
Those people did something to me.	Saa nkurɔfo no yɛɛ me biribi.
I can’t see anyone in front of us or behind us	Mintumi nhu obiara wɔ yɛn anim anaa yɛn akyi
Not because of your mother.	Ɛnyɛ wo maame nti.
Sounds like a great idea.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwene kɛse.
I believed it was	Ná migye di sɛ ɛyɛ saa
Maybe he can do better.	Ebia obetumi ayɛ yiye.
I quickly got out of his way	Meyɛɛ ntɛm fii ne kwan so
One cannot eat anything that is not alive.	Obi ntumi nni biribiara a nkwa nnim.
You own them.	Wo na wowɔ wɔn.
You have to do a little bit of everything.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribiara mu kakra.
I have to sleep.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda.
I was just like my father	Ná mete sɛ me papa ara pɛ
I join in every evening	Mede me ho hyɛ mu anwummere biara
Her mother was so beautiful, so beautiful.	Ná ne maame ho yɛ fɛ yiye, na ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I didn't want to talk to them about anything	Ná mempɛ sɛ me ne wɔn bɛka biribiara ho asɛm
They are just very unlikely.	Wɔyɛ nea ɛnyɛ yiye koraa ara kwa.
I'm looking at you.	Mehwɛ wo.
It’s a picture of everyone.	Ɛyɛ obiara mfonini.
He tells you what he thinks	Ɔka nea osusuw ho kyerɛ wo
I had almost forgotten him	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na me werɛ afi no
We are very happy.	Yɛn ani agye yiye.
I could show you many beautiful things	Ná metumi akyerɛ wo nneɛma a ɛyɛ fɛ pii
That’s his name.	Ɛno ne ne din.
I haven't played in years	Mfe pii ni a minni agoru
I kind of touched them first.	Mede me nsa kaa wɔn kan wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
We all know that now.	Yɛn nyinaa nim saa mprempren.
And best friends look after each other.	Na nnamfo paa nso hwɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho.
Speak to us.	Kasa kyerɛ yɛn.
His was in his car.	Ná ne de no wɔ ne kar mu.
But not too often.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mpɛn pii dodo.
I had no idea about this	Ná minni eyi ho adwene biara
It will only be for a while.	Ɛbɛyɛ bere bi pɛ.
If something was going on, I would tell you	Sɛ biribi rekɔ so a, anka mɛka akyerɛ wo
That’s how it works.	Saa na ɛyɛ adwuma.
I used to live here.	Kan no na mete ha.
It wasn’t a thing at the time.	Na ɛnyɛ ade saa bere no.
It is available and inexpensive.	Ɛwɔ hɔ na ne bo nyɛ den.
At this point, no one has any idea.	Saa bere yi de, obiara nni ho adwene biara.
He was fascinated by her.	Ná n’ani gye ne ho.
I was there for two blissful days	Ná mewɔ hɔ nna abien a anigye ahyɛ mu ma
I think you’re right	Misusuw sɛ woayɛ no yiye
I make movies.	Meyɛ sini ahorow.
I just can’t do it right	Mintumi nyɛ yiye kɛkɛ
There is so much more to know.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
I knew that was my last hope	Ná minim sɛ ɛno ne bere a etwa to a mewɔ anidaso
The book thing is over.	Nhoma mu ade no aba awiei.
Be thankful for what you have.	Da ase wɔ nea wowɔ no ho.
You can’t do these two things at the same time.	Worentumi nyɛ saa nneɛma abien yi bere koro mu.
I shouldn’t think it’s true	Ɛnsɛ sɛ misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nokware
If not, the story is over.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, asɛm no aba awiei.
I didn’t have to do that	Ná enhia sɛ meyɛ saa
It just got bigger from there.	Na ɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa fi hɔ.
It was a perfect shot.	Ná ɛyɛ tuo a edi mũ.
He didn't have much to say.	Ná onni nsɛm pii a ɔbɛka.
Take some time out of your day to wear this.	Gye bere kakra fi wo da no mu na hyɛ eyi.
Most of the time, he is himself.	Mpɛn pii no, ɔyɛ ɔno ara.
I need to know these things	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu saa nneɛma yi
Which is not a bad thing.	Nea ɛnyɛ ade bɔne.
I can do anything for three hours	Metumi ayɛ biribiara nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa.
In this case, there is no trend.	Wɔ eyi mu no, su biara nni hɔ a ɛrekɔ so.
This shouldn’t be the case.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ saa.
This isn't that great either.	Eyi nso nyɛ kɛse saa.
It has some power.	Ɛwɔ tumi bi.
I really like your people	M’ani gye wo nkurɔfo ho ankasa
I want to be here too	Mepɛ sɛ me nso mewɔ ha
His mother and I looked after him, day and night	Me ne ne maame hwɛɛ no, awia ne anadwo
I don’t think so anymore.	Minsusuw saa bio.
I can’t do that, though	Mintumi nyɛ saa, nanso
Your support means a lot.	Mo mmoa no kyerɛ pii.
I just wanted to talk to him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa kɛkɛ.
I had to be invisible	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ obi a obiara nhu me
He is a wonderful dog.	Ɔyɛ ɔkraman a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
If anyone can do it, we can do it.	Sɛ obi betumi ayɛ a, yɛn nso yebetumi ayɛ.
In his last hours, he thinks of you.	Wɔ ne nnɔnhwerew a etwa to no mu no, osusuw wo ho.
I'm sure there must be something like that	Migye di sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ biribi a ɛte saa wɔ hɔ
He is such a vulnerable person.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ mmerɛw saa.
I have a lot of things going on	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛrekɔ so
I had to tell him.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no.
One sheet on top of two.	Krataa biako wɔ abien so.
I really like this story	M’ani gye saa asɛm yi ho paa
I joined in with it.	Mede me ho bɔɔ ho.
I know how you people work	Minim sɛnea mo nkurɔfo yɛ adwuma
But not now.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mprempren.
In our house.	Wɔ yɛn fie.
If so , the	Sɛ ɛte saa a .

This is a new era.	Eyi yɛ bere foforo.
This was going to be harder than he thought.	Ná eyi bɛyɛ den sen sɛnea na osusuw.
I feel so strong.	Mete nka sɛ me ho yɛ den yiye.
I never want to be with someone like that	Mempɛ sɛ me ne obi a ɔte saa bɛbɔ da
I missed them so much	Ná me werɛ fii wɔn paa
I want to know everything about him	Mepɛ sɛ mihu ne ho biribiara
The first-night trend continued.	Anadwo a edi kan no su no kɔɔ so traa hɔ.
I had no time to argue	Ná minni bere a mede begye akyinnye
I knew this was hard for him	Ná minim sɛ eyi yɛ den ma no
He has driven his first car into his new home.	Ɔde ne kar a edi kan akɔ ne fie foforo no mu.
I knew he knew the whole truth	Ná minim sɛ onim nokware no nyinaa
I forgot all about this	Me werɛ fii eyi nyinaa
As if someone had said such a thing to him.	Te sɛ nea obi aka asɛm a ɛte saa akyerɛ no.
It was my son’s head.	Ná ɛyɛ me ba no ti.
Something very big will go.	Biribi kɛse paa bi bɛkɔ.
That is the case with us.	Ɛte saa wɔ yɛn fam.
A beautiful picture	Mfonini a ɛyɛ fɛ
Our work is challenging but not difficult.	Yɛn adwuma no yɛ den nanso ɛnyɛ den.
Maybe someone should look into this.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ obi hwɛ eyi mu.
I can use my rights to those other things	Metumi de me hokwan ahorow no adi dwuma wɔ saa nneɛma foforo no ho
You are doing this tonight.	Woreyɛ saa anadwo yi.
However, I have to go	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ
I can’t make you happy.	Mintumi mma w’ani nnye.
I slipped myself to the ground	Mede me ho sii fam
No one was really in control.	Ná obiara nni hɔ a odi so ankasa.
I can’t see your eyes	Mintumi nhu w’ani
I can never get out of it all	Mintumi mfi ne nyinaa mu da
But this is home.	Nanso eyi yɛ fie.
I just loved that	M’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho ara kwa
Very beautiful girl.	Abeawa a ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Please tell me what is going on.	Mesrɛ wo, ka nea ɛrekɔ so no kyerɛ me.
He told me that too, but not now.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me saa nso, nanso ɛnyɛ mprempren.
I couldn’t feel anything anymore	Ná mintumi nte biribiara nka bio
It’s a good thing the school year was almost over.	Ɛyɛ ade pa a na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ sukuu afe no aba awiei.
I really missed you.	Me werɛ fii wo ankasa.
I hoped the movie would be good.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ sini no bɛyɛ papa.
I would end it sooner	Anka mede bɛba awiei ntɛm
I leaned in, looked at him.	Mede me ho too mu, hwɛɛ no.
He feels so powerful again now.	Ɔte nka sɛ ɔwɔ tumi kɛse bio mprempren.
I had their attention	Ná mewɔ wɔn adwene
You can go to school if you want.	Wubetumi akɔ sukuu sɛ wopɛ a.
This sounded very interesting.	Ná eyi te sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
I have something to tell you.	Mewɔ biribi a mɛka akyerɛ wo.
He had no chance.	Ná onni hokwan biara.
I would be.	Mɛyɛ.
I'm! 	Me!
There is no room for all of us.	Baabi nni hɔ mma yɛn nyinaa.
It’s pretty amazing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
I think they do well, but again, first use.	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ yiye, nanso bio, nea edi kan a wɔde di dwuma.
I understand that no one is perfect.	Mete ase sɛ obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ pɛ.
There is still something here.	Biribi da so ara wɔ ha.
And they do say it.	Na wɔka ampa ara.
I just wanted to check it out	Ná mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu kɛkɛ
I found him sitting in a cell	Mihuu no sɛ ɔte afiase dan bi mu
This works well.	Eyi yɛ adwuma yiye.
I know what happened	Minim nea asi
No one knew he was here.	Ná obiara nnim sɛ ɔwɔ ha.
I’m not doing anything.	Me ho nyɛ hwee.
It was beautiful and powerful and amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ na tumi wom na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Something very important.	Biribi a ɛho hia paa.
It was his time, just as it was his.	Ná ɛyɛ ne bere, sɛnea na ɛyɛ ne de no ara pɛ.
He could just go home.	Ná obetumi akɔ fie ara kwa.
I didn’t know what to do with him	Ná minnim nea mede bɛyɛ no
This sounds very strange.	Eyi te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
They paid close attention.	Wɔde wɔn adwene sii so yiye.
I can’t believe what has happened	Mintumi nnye nea asi no nni
I hope you’ve enjoyed the course.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani agye adesua no ho.
I'm afraid of everything.	Me suro biribiara.
But you don't hear anything'	Nanso mo nte hwee'.
I can do it over the phone for you	Metumi ayɛ no wɔ telefon so ama wo
There is an interesting idea.	Anigye adwene bi wɔ hɔ.
I couldn’t believe it, someone like me	Na mintumi nnye nni, obi te sɛ me
Keep the path easy.	Ma ɔkwan no nyɛ mmerɛw.
No wonder my father liked him.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ na me papa ani gye ne ho.
I am so sorry for what happened	Ɛyɛ me yaw paa wɔ nea esii no ho
Your time is not now.	Wo bere no nyɛ mprempren.
I think, finally, the time has come	Misusuw sɛ, awiei koraa no, bere no adu
You may already know a few.	Ebia wunim kakraa bi dedaw.
Thank you so much for your comments.	Meda mo ase pii wɔ mo nsɛm no ho.
I have a long-term career.	Mewɔ adwuma a mede bere tenten ayɛ.
I guess being nice about it doesn’t work	Misusuw sɛ sɛ́ wobɛyɛ fɛ wɔ ho no ntumi nyɛ adwuma
It was all wrong.	Ná ne nyinaa di mfomso.
He is a human being.	Ɔyɛ onipa.
I just wanted to take one last look at him	Ná mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ no nea etwa to ara kwa
When it’s the past.	Bere a ɛyɛ bere a atwam no.
However, that’s how you find it to be true.	Nanso, saa na wuhu sɛ ɛyɛ nokware.
That for me is out of it.	Ɛno ma me no afi mu.
I was much younger than him	Ná meyɛ abofra sen no koraa
I really really like it	M’ani gye ho ankasa ankasa
But that’s just my opinion.	Nanso ɛno yɛ m’adwene nkutoo.
That doesn’t really matter.	Ɛno ho nhia ankasa.
I was there, and that didn’t happen	Na mewɔ hɔ, na ɛnyɛ saa na esii
Each of us wanted to be him.	Ná yɛn mu biara pɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ɔno.
There is something here that you need to know.	Biribi wɔ ha a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
This should work and you can easily add more features.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma na wubetumi de nneɛma pii aka ho ntɛmntɛm.
I didn’t want to think about something bad going on	Ná mempɛ sɛ misusuw biribi bɔne bi a ɛrekɔ so ho
I couldn’t really say.	Na mintumi nka ankasa.
I didn’t know he was home	Ná minnim sɛ ɔwɔ fie
One of three things.	Nneɛma abiɛsa no mu biako.
I just want to see you	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wo ara kwa
The reason for this is life.	Nea enti a ɛte saa ne nkwa.
I didn’t know it was a dog	Ná minnim sɛ ɛyɛ ɔkraman
But something that works.	Nanso biribi a ɛyɛ adwuma.
This house was not empty.	Ná ofie yi nni hɔ a hwee nni mu.
I can see no reason why he shouldn’t	Mintumi nhu biribiara a enti ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa
They are carried, to every person.	Wɔde wɔn kɔ, onipa biara so.
And over the years, they’ve just gotten better at it.	Na mfe pii a atwam no, wɔn ho akokwaw wɔ mu ara kwa.
I see this too.	Mihu eyi nso.
I could show you how	Ná metumi akyerɛ wo sɛnea wɔyɛ
I'm doing that.	Meyɛ saa.
We already have enough trouble.	Yɛwɔ ɔhaw a ɛdɔɔso dedaw.
There was food.	Ná aduan wɔ hɔ.
When he did, it was always something important.	Sɛ ɔyɛ saa a, na ɛyɛ biribi a ɛho hia bere nyinaa.
I wanted to save her from him	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye no fi ne ho
The song is awesome.	Dwom no yɛ hu.
I can't give those names	Mintumi mfa saa din ahorow no mma
You seem nice enough.	Ɛte sɛ nea wo ho yɛ fɛ sɛnea ɛsɛ.
It has everything on my list.	Ɛwɔ biribiara a ɛwɔ me din mu.
It’s good that you’ve done that.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ woayɛ saa.
And he was doing a good job of it.	Na na ɔreyɛ adwuma pa bi wɔ ho.
I think you’ll like an even bigger one	Misusuw sɛ w’ani begye nea ɛyɛ kɛse mpo ho
But that time for that boy, that child, has passed now.	Nanso saa bere no ma saa abarimaa no, saa abofra no, atwam mprempren.
I didn’t really know what else to say	Ná minnim nea mɛka bio ankasa
This works well in many cases.	Eyi yɛ adwuma yiye wɔ nsɛm pii mu.
After a moment the door closed.	Bere tiaa bi akyi no, ɔpon no too mu.
No problem this time.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ saa bere yi.
He was a father.	Ná ɔyɛ papa.
I just think she's hot	Misusuw kɛkɛ sɛ ne ho yɛ hyew
It shouldn’t have been.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
I was somewhere else	Ná mewɔ baabi foforo
I could be wrong .	Metumi adi mfomso .
I have done that too many times	Mayɛ saa mpɛn pii dodo
I think someone told him.	Misusuw sɛ obi ka kyerɛɛ no.
I am concerned about you.	Mo ho asɛm haw me.
I’m really enjoying this.	M’ani gye eyi ho yiye.
I had nothing since the night before	Ná minni hwee fi anadwo a edi kan no
However, he did so anyway.	Nanso, ɔyɛɛ saa ɔkwan biara so.
For me, it’s good.	Me fam no, eye.
We have to be the superpower.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ tumi kɛse no.
I told him not to, but it was a lie	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɔnyɛ saa, nanso na ɛyɛ atoro
Who I just didn’t know who to trust	Nea na minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ mede me ho to no so ara kwa
It’s not like that for everyone.	Ɛnte saa ma obiara.
I want you to be my son	Mepɛ sɛ woyɛ me ba
That may not be what you want.	Ebia ɛno nyɛ nea wopɛ.
But it didn’t work.	Nanso anyɛ adwuma.
I had to talk to him, let him understand	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa, ma ɔte ase
I want something better.	Mepɛ biribi a eye sen saa.
I could see nothing else	Ná mintumi nhu biribi foforo biara
Close to this time.	Bɛn saa bere yi.
I would have given him anything at that point	Anka mede biribiara bɛma no wɔ saa bere no mu
I know that made him feel better	Minim sɛ ɛno maa ne ho tɔɔ no
I squinted, unable to see an underpass	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ so, na na mintumi nhu ɔkwan bi a ɛda fam
You want to do it.	Wopɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I expect good things from you	Mehwɛ nneɛma pa kwan fi mo hɔ
I just couldn’t believe he did all that	Na mintumi nnye nni kɛkɛ sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa nneɛma no nyinaa
It was absolutely terrifying.	Ná ɛyɛ hu koraa.
I looked like a total disaster	Ná mete sɛ asiane koraa
But it doesn’t really matter much.	Nanso ɛho nhia pii ankasa.
He just seemed happy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea n’ani agye ara kwa.
I have been planning this day for a week	Mayɛ saa da yi ho nhyehyɛe dapɛn biako ni
For now, a little sleep.	Mprempren de, da kakra.
This will be our problem from now on.	Eyi bɛyɛ yɛn haw fi saa bere yi rekɔ.
Not even when it mattered.	Ɛnyɛ bere a na ɛho hia mpo.
There is something for everyone.	Biribi wɔ hɔ ma obiara.
Lots of food.	Aduan pii.
Maybe I feel the same way	Ebia na mete nka saa ara
Take this.	Fa eyi.
Time is time.	Bere yɛ bere.
The meeting ended shortly thereafter	Nhyiam no baa awiei wɔ ɛno akyi bere tiaa bi
I needed to know this	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu eyi
I hadn’t thought it through.	Ná minsusuw ho yiye.
I've been a bit busy lately.	Mewɔ adagyew kakra nnansa yi.
I want it to be there	Mepɛ sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ
I get feedback every day.	Me nsa ka nsɛm a wɔka kyerɛ da biara da.
So what happened.	So nea esii.
There are too many risks.	Asiane pii dodo wɔ hɔ.
There was nothing else we could have done	Ná biribiara nni hɔ bio a anka yebetumi ayɛ
There were police everywhere.	Ná polisifo wɔ hɔ nyinaa.
It has been a terrible time.	Ayɛ bere a ɛyɛ hu.
None of them could do anything.	Wɔn mu biara antumi anyɛ hwee.
I thought this meant something	Misusuwii sɛ eyi kyerɛ biribi
I think he must have known	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na onim
I want to keep myself busy	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ me ho adagyew
I felt much the same way about him	Saa ara na me nso metee nka wɔ ne ho kɛse
Both of them.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa.
I wanted him for the long time	Ná mepɛ no bere tenten no
He has to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu.
But nobody saw him in another car or anything.	Nanso obiara anhu no wɔ kar foforo mu anaa biribiara mu.
It’s not surprising.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa.
We can decide in the morning.	Yebetumi asi ho gyinae anɔpa.
But that was then, and this is now.	Nanso na ɛte saa saa bere no, na eyi ne mprempren.
Not everyone can do it.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na obetumi ayɛ.
That time has passed.	Saa bere no atwam.
I love what he’s doing	M’ani gye nea ɔreyɛ no ho
I couldn’t tell anyone about it.	Na mintumi nka ho asɛm nkyerɛ obiara.
I wanted to work with them	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne wɔn yɛ adwuma
I just didn't know that	Ná minnim sɛ ɛte saa ara kwa
I check it several times a day.	Mehwɛ mu mpɛn pii da biara.
None of these things happened.	Saa nneɛma yi mu biara amma.
It looks pretty cool.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
But people do good things.	Nanso nkurɔfo yɛ nneɛma pa.
I've put myself in the way on it, you know.	Mede me ho ahyɛ kwan no mu wɔ so, wunim.
Beautiful inside and out.	Ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ mu ne akyi.
I have to take her home with me	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede no ka me ho kɔ fie
Of that, there is no doubt.	Ɛno ho no, akyinnye biara nni ho.
I want a simple dress	Mepɛ atade a ɛnyɛ den
I have no authority in these matters	Minni tumi biara wɔ nsɛm yi mu
He is a beautiful character.	Ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I will use that	Mede saa asɛm no bedi dwuma
Remember, stay strong and have fun!.	Kae sɛ, kɔ so yɛ den na gye w’ani!.
There are very few indeed.	Kakraa bi pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ ampa.
He had done well.	Ná wayɛ yiye.
But things had moved on.	Nanso na nneɛma akɔ so.
But the problem goes deeper than that.	Nanso ɔhaw no kɔ akyiri sen saa.
All we have is today.	Nea yɛwɔ ara ne nnɛ.
Remember, anything is possible.	Kae sɛ biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye.
His eyes are still on the road.	N’ani da so ara wɔ kwan no so.
It’s a situation that no one wants.	Ɛyɛ tebea a obiara mpɛ.
Check out more of her photos here.	Hwɛ ne mfonini ahorow pii wɔ ha.
You were all at the meeting.	Ná mo nyinaa wɔ nhyiam no ase.
I want you to be beautiful	Mepɛ sɛ wo ho yɛ fɛ
That’s the way it is in.	Saa na ɛte wɔ.
However, many did not.	Nanso, pii anyɛ saa.
So this is quite like a number of lives.	Enti eyi te sɛ nkwa dodow bi koraa.
That is not their fault.	Ɛno nyɛ wɔn mfomso.
There was no time.	Na bere biara nni hɔ.
It just really is that.	Ɛyɛ saa ankasa ara kwa.
I didn’t know if you could get inside.	Na minnim sɛ ebia wubetumi akɔ mu anaa.
I couldn’t understand it before.	Ná mintumi nte ase kan.
I knew they were dangerous	Ná minim sɛ wɔn ho yɛ hu
Which was only partially true.	Nea na ɛyɛ nokware fã bi pɛ.
I can’t begin to understand that	Mintumi mfi ase nte saa asɛm no ase
But we will do that later.	Nanso yɛbɛyɛ saa akyiri yi.
Next week will be interesting.	Dapɛn a edi hɔ no bɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye.
Just start with the plan.	Fa nhyehyɛe no fi ase kɛkɛ.
I couldn’t see things in it.	Ná mintumi nhu nneɛma wɔ mu.
I only saw him yesterday	Nnɛra nkutoo na mihuu no
Speak to me.	Kasa ma me.
Where is it located.	Ɛhe na ɛwɔ.
Someone else has to do the other work	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi foforo yɛ adwuma foforo no
We are much better than this	Yɛyɛ papa sen eyi koraa
That was a problem.	Ná ɛno yɛ ɔhaw.
Of course, he would have.	Ampa, anka ɔbɛyɛ saa.
It was about the same size.	Ná ne kɛse bɛyɛ sɛ saa ara.
I can't say anything else.	Mintumi nka biribi foforo biara.
I could do it in a few days	Ná metumi de nna kakra ayɛ
He was in good shape.	Ná ɔwɔ tebea pa mu.
I can end this right now	Metumi de eyi aba awiei mprempren ara
He was the only one there.	Ná ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
That would have been fun.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ anigye.
You’ll be happy with him.	W’ani begye ne ho.
I looked at him coldly	Mede awɔw hwɛɛ no
But it was a long time ago.	Nanso na bere tenten atwam.
My mom just told me that this morning.	Me maame kaa saa asɛm no kyerɛɛ me anɔpa yi ara kwa.
Or what this has to do with me.	Anaasɛ nea eyi ne me wɔ yɛ.
You get a car.	Wo nsa ka kar.
I want to talk to you alone	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo nkutoo kasa
In the end, it was all my attention.	Awiei koraa no, na ɛyɛ m’adwene nyinaa.
I can show you later	Metumi akyerɛ wo akyiri yi
Very comfortable bed.	Mpa a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
He spent a few hours working on it.	Ɔde nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi yɛɛ ho adwuma.
Nothing is good for him.	Biribiara nni hɔ a eye ma no.
I didn’t know what he would do	Ná minnim nea ɔbɛyɛ
Take advantage of what the situation offers.	Fa nea tebea no de ma no di dwuma.
I just loved playing with it	Ná m’ani gye ho ara kwa sɛ mede bedi agoru
Very good friends.	Nnamfo pa paa.
In his words, it’s a big deal.	Wɔ ne nsɛm mu no, ɛyɛ asɛm kɛse.
Nothing surprised me.	Biribiara anyɛ me nwonwa.
No one was surprised.	Obiara anyɛ no nwonwa.
He slammed into the table, full of himself.	Ɔde ne ho bɔɔ pon no so, na na ne ho ahyɛ hɔ ma.
Take that, of course.	Fa saa asɛm no, ampa.
I don’t know any at all	Minnim biara koraa
That would have been one thing.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ ade biako.
Order had no chance here.	Ná nhyehyɛe nni hokwan biara wɔ ha.
So follow it.	Enti di so.
That was terrifying for me.	Ná ɛno yɛ hu ma me.
Maybe it mattered to me.	Ebia na ɛho hia me.
I hope you do as well	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wobɛyɛ sɛnea ɛte no
I knew it must be his father	Ná minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ne papa
That should make you very happy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ma w’ani gye paa.
He knew them well.	Ná onim wɔn yiye.
I knew it would, someday	Na minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa, da bi
But he seemed to feel that he had.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea ɔte nka sɛ wayɛ saa.
That’s not what they do for them.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea wɔyɛ ma wɔn.
I couldn’t see his eyes	Na mintumi nhu n’ani
The meeting is over.	Nhyiam no aba awiei.
He loves me.	Ɔpɛ me.
They completely forgot.	Wɔn werɛ fii koraa.
You can review his licenses here .	Wubetumi ahwɛ ne tumi krataa ahorow no mu wɔ ha .
That’s all he knows.	Ɛno ara ne nea onim.
Despite all the help, the situation seemed hopeless.	Wɔ mmoa ahorow nyinaa akyi no, na ɛte sɛ nea tebea no yɛ nea anidaso biara nnim.
I think you shouldn’t	Misusuw sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa
Maybe one of a year.	Ebia afe biako mu biako.
Or is there?.	Anaasɛ ɛwɔ hɔ?.
Isn’t it something? 	So ɛnyɛ biribi?
His concentration was amazing.	Ná n’adwene a ɔde sii so no yɛɛ nwonwa.
It was beautiful in a way	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ wɔ ɔkwan bi so
I don't think he should	Misusuw sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa
That doesn’t appeal to me at all.	Ɛno nnye m’ani koraa.
I didn’t want to have to deal with anyone.	Ná mempɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ me ne obiara di nsɛm.
Every single part of it.	Ne fã biako biara.
I think better is always possible	Misusuw sɛ nea eye sen saa betumi aba bere nyinaa
He lives with his mother.	Ɔne ne maame na ɛte.
I just wanted to talk to him	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa kɛkɛ
These things come from within the people themselves.	Saa nneɛma yi fi nnipa no ankasa mu.
I would tell them all	Anka mɛka akyerɛ wɔn nyinaa
I told you he was a little weird	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ ɔyɛ nwonwa kakra
It will be great for him.	Ɛbɛyɛ kɛse ama no.
I couldn’t feel him anymore.	Ná mintumi nte ne nka bio.
Things just need planning.	Nneɛma hia nhyehyɛe ara kwa.
I was weak, very weak	Ná meyɛ mmerɛw, na meyɛ mmerɛw yiye
His head hurt.	Ne ti yɛɛ no ​​yaw.
I wish he would end it sooner	Me yam a anka ɔde bɛba awiei ntɛm
I think that was a mistake	Misusuw sɛ na ɛno yɛ mfomso
I had one back in the house	Ná mewɔ biako akyi wɔ fie hɔ
However, no one noticed.	Nanso, obiara anhu.
I would have thought so.	Anka misusuw saa.
Forget about this for now.	Wo werɛ mfi eyi ho mprempren.
If it’s too little, do nothing.	Sɛ ɛyɛ kakraa bi a, nyɛ hwee.
The house was great.	Ná ofie no yɛ kɛse.
They were copies of each other.	Ná wɔyɛ wɔn ho wɔn ho mfonini.
On a table.	Wɔ pon bi so.
He had never liked them.	Ná n’ani nnye wɔn ho da.
I think you can do it	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi ayɛ
However, it wasn’t fun.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ anigye.
In a household.	Wɔ ofie bi mu.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani gye ho ankasa.
I could have been there or something	Anka metumi aba hɔ anaa biribi a ɛte saa
I was just the boy	Ná meyɛ abarimaa no ara
It’s my fault.	Ɛyɛ me mfomso.
One should see there by morning.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi hu wɔ hɔ ansa na anɔpa adu.
It has to be that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
Look at yourself through my eyes.	Hwɛ wo ho fa m’ani so.
He has his favorite things.	Ɔwɔ nneɛma a n’ani gye ho paa.
I always knew it was a lie	Ná minim bere nyinaa sɛ ɛyɛ atoro
And the timelines go down.	Na bere nhyehyɛe ahorow no kɔ fam.
I love the flow of his plan	M’ani gye sɛnea ne nhyehyɛe no fa so no ho
Make sure you have lots and lots of time.	Hwɛ hu sɛ wowɔ bere pii ne bere pii.
That you weren't good enough for him now.	Sɛ na wonyɛ papa mma no mprempren.
Time will pass.	Bere bɛkɔ so.
I never want you to do anything else	Mempɛ sɛ woyɛ biribi foforo biara da
His was a bit of a problem, too.	Ná ne de no nso yɛ ɔhaw kakra.
I didn’t want to owe him anything	Ná mempɛ sɛ mede no ka biara
Please if you like me	Mesrɛ wo sɛ wopɛ me
That’s exciting.	Ɛno yɛ anigye.
This is my favorite song.	Eyi ne dwom a m’ani gye ho paa.
I think anything cheap but beautiful	Misusuw sɛ biribiara a ne bo yɛ mmerɛw nanso ɛyɛ fɛ
I don’t know how that started	Minnim sɛnea saa asɛm no fii ase
I think you have a problem.	Misusuw sɛ wowɔ ɔhaw bi.
He doesn’t want you.	Ɔmpɛ wo.
If you want them, save them.	Sɛ wopɛ wɔn a, gye wɔn.
You touch so much life.	Woka nkwa pii saa.
I shouldn’t have talked to you like that	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa saa
I also hope we can remain friends	Me nso mewɔ anidaso sɛ yebetumi akɔ so ayɛ nnamfo
I'll take you with me	Mede wo bɛka me ho
Nothing else really matters.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a ɛho hia ankasa.
He seemed to be gone.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onni hɔ.
But it wasn’t mine.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ me de.
There was a door.	Ná ɔpon bi wɔ hɔ.
He should never have joined them.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho bɔ wɔn ho da.
Thank you, we couldn’t have done it without your help.	Meda mo ase, sɛ mo mmoa nka ho a, yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
That’s more of the same thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade koro no ara kɛse.
That is one beautiful dress.	Ɛno yɛ atade a ɛyɛ fɛ biako.
You know what they do.	Wunim nea wɔyɛ.
I can only go by their word.	Wɔn asɛm nkutoo na metumi akɔ.
I’m a little bit interested	M’ani gye ho kakra
I think he’s a nuisance.	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛ ɔhaw.
Perhaps even word of mouth worked well.	Ebia na asɛm a wɔde ano ka mpo yɛɛ adwuma yiye.
I have to disagree here	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no nyɛ adwene wɔ ha
What a beautiful picture.	Mfonini a ɛyɛ fɛ bɛn ara ni.
So he was clear-headed.	Enti na n’adwene mu da hɔ.
On the phone.	Wɔ telefon so.
You are working well with you.	Wo ne wo reyɛ adwuma yiye.
I had no idea what this could be	Ná minnim nea eyi betumi ayɛ
But these issues were nothing new.	Nanso na nsɛm yi nyɛ ade foforo.
Give me just one coin.	Ma me sika biako pɛ.
I feel great for him	Mete nka kɛse ma no
He was in trouble, big trouble.	Ná ɔwɔ ɔhaw mu, ɔhaw kɛse.
There is one more thing.	Ade biako bio wɔ hɔ.
According to their schedule.	Sɛnea wɔn nhyehyɛe kyerɛ no.
The path seems clear.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔkwan no mu da hɔ.
I lived alone for a while	Me nkutoo traa ase kakra
I hope it will be the same for you !	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa ara ama wo !
I think it will be a meeting room	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nhyiam dan
People are very nice.	Nkurɔfo ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I love it there, easy or not	M’ani gye ho wɔ hɔ, sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw anaasɛ ɛnte saa
I have to talk to him alone	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no nkutoo kasa
I want to taste everything.	Mepɛ sɛ meka biribiara hwɛ.
I did, of course.	Meyɛɛ saa, ampa.
I was just excited.	Ná m’ani agye ara kwa.
I’m still having fun	M’ani da so ara gye m’ani
I couldn’t leave the house.	Na mintumi mfi fie hɔ.
It has worked well.	Ayɛ adwuma yiye.
I am one of those animals	Meka saa mmoa no ho
I'm the only one who thinks about it.	Me nkutoo na misusuw ho.
He gets involved.	Ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu.
I am still thankful for it	Meda so ara da ase wɔ ho
It’s not that hard.	Ɛnyɛ den saa.
Now is the time to act.	Mprempren ne bere a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi.
It’s just not something that exists now.	Ɛnyɛ biribi a ɛwɔ hɔ mprempren ara kwa.
A number of times.	Mpɛn dodow bi.
I only do what is best for the job.	Nea eye ma adwuma no nkutoo na meyɛ.
It’s just very complicated.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den yiye ara kwa.
I was sorry for that whole morning	Ná ɛyɛ me yaw wɔ saa anɔpa no nyinaa ho
I talk too much about work	Meka adwuma ho asɛm dodo
I have been hurt by their pain.	Wɔn yaw no ayɛ me yaw.
Not that it wasn’t interesting.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɛnyɛ anigye.
This is wrong in many cases.	Eyi yɛ mfomso wɔ nsɛm pii mu.
I couldn’t figure out what it was	Na mintumi nhu nea ɛyɛ
You can get that.	Wubetumi anya saa.
He's just playing.	Ɔyɛ agoru ara kwa.
He must be doing something right.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔreyɛ biribi yiye.
Everyone gets out eventually.	Obiara fi adi awiei koraa no.
He thought she would help him	Ná osusuw sɛ ɔbɛboa no
He is as great as it gets.	Ɔyɛ kɛse sɛnea ɛyɛ.
This was one of those days.	Ná eyi yɛ saa nna no mu biako.
I need this done immediately please	Me hia sɛ wɔyɛ eyi ntɛm ara mesrɛ wo
And it was terrible.	Na ɛyɛ hu.
I am still working on one thing.	Meda so ara reyɛ ade biako ho adwuma.
Nor is this the whole story.	Saa ara nso na eyi nyɛ asɛm no nyinaa.
I can give him anything he wants	Metumi de biribiara a ɔpɛ ama no
All of this is possible.	Eyi nyinaa betumi ayɛ yiye.
I need to know that you really believe in me	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛ wugye me di ampa
I can’t see anything about him	Mintumi nhu ne ho hwee
I wasn’t alone	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na na mewɔ hɔ
I could hardly believe it.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nnye nni.
We all have the same rights.	Yɛn nyinaa wɔ hokwan koro.
But it’s not my father.	Nanso ɛnyɛ me papa.
That’s how they work.	Saa na wɔyɛ adwuma.
And you can’t do that either.	Na wo nso worentumi nyɛ saa.
I knew it was a bad idea to be here alone	Ná minim sɛ ɛyɛ adwene bɔne sɛ me nkutoo bɛba ha
You can get that one.	Wubetumi anya saa biako no.
I think that will continue to work	Misusuw sɛ ɛno bɛkɔ so ayɛ adwuma
Thank you for it.	Meda mo ase wɔ ho.
Maybe the next one.	Ebia nea edi hɔ no.
I have to take care of these people	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ saa nkurɔfo yi
I don’t know what the danger was then.	Me nnim asiane a na ɛwɔ hɔ saa bere no.
This is really rare now.	Eyi ho yɛ na ankasa mprempren.
He was a man who might do well .	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ebia obetumi ayɛ yiye .
I used to do this all the time	Ná meyɛ eyi bere nyinaa
We are better than that.	Yɛyɛ papa sen saa.
It was really, really fun.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye ankasa, ankasa.
I have a test for you	Mewɔ sɔhwɛ bi ma wo
A little something for you	Biribi kakra ma wo
I could still feel his heat inside me.	Ná meda so ara te ne hyew nka wɔ me mu.
I felt really bad.	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ bɔne bi ankasa.
Her hair fell on me.	Ne ti nhwi no hwee ase wɔ me so.
I hope we can help each other.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ yebetumi aboa yɛn ho yɛn ho.
There’s not much room for that right now.	Ɛno ho kwan pii nni hɔ mprempren.
You can tell me what you know along the way.	Wubetumi aka nea wunim akyerɛ me wɔ kwan so.
This was the most important issue.	Ná eyi ne asɛm a ɛho hia sen biara.
This was too late.	Ná eyi aka akyi dodo.
I don’t want to be touched either	Me nso mempɛ sɛ mede me nsa bɛka me
There may have been more.	Ebia na pii wɔ hɔ.
I'm very, very good at it	Me ho akokwaw wɔ mu yiye, yiye
So you have to use those.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ wode saa nneɛma no di dwuma.
What was happening now, was happening then.	Nea na ɛrekɔ so mprempren no, na ɛrekɔ so saa bere no.
I shrugged it off though	Mede me nsa kyerɛɛ so nanso
You can definitely land there.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wubetumi asi fam wɔ hɔ.
I took me to my basement	Mede me kɔɔ me dan ase
But other than that, it just seems weird to me.	Nanso sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa ma me.
I was in a lot of trouble later	Ná mewɔ ɔhaw kɛse mu akyiri yi
But that was nothing new.	Nanso na ɛno nyɛ ade foforo.
A big part of me certainly didn’t	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ me fã kɛse bi anyɛ saa
Your cars are here.	Wo kar ahorow no wɔ ha.
There are many different brands.	Nneɛma ahorow pii wɔ hɔ a wɔde yɛ nneɛma.
Something has to go on.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi kɔ so tra hɔ.
Or at least it seemed that way.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
I leaned in front of the door, looked at him.	Mede me ho too ɔpon no anim, hwɛɛ no.
I had to go to work then	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ adwuma saa bere no
I didn’t know you could find what you liked	Ná minnim sɛ wubetumi anya nea w’ani gye ho
Apparently that is what happened.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛno ne nea esii.
Hope you can give me a hand.	Anidaso sɛ wubetumi ama me nsa.
It’s obviously an interesting week for us.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛyɛ dapɛn a ɛyɛ anigye ma yɛn.
He touched it with his hand.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ho.
I wanted to feel her.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mete ne nka.
I loved the feel of his big hand	M’ani gyee sɛnea ne nsa kɛse no te nka no ho
I felt great for him	Metee nka kɛse wɔ ne ho
That seems to be the story of the week.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ne dapɛn no mu asɛm.
And yet you do.	Na nanso woyɛ saa.
I like that in a man	M’ani gye saa wɔ ɔbarima mu
I can’t do that.	Mintumi nyɛ saa.
I could see you, by the way	Na metumi ahu wo, ɔkwan bi so no
Many people took that route	Nnipa pii faa saa kwan no so
I thought so.	Misusuwii saa.
Only we can see a situation as such.	Yɛn nkutoo na yebetumi ahu tebea bi sɛ ɛte saa.
In the end, he was a man.	Awiei koraa no, na ɔyɛ ɔbarima.
You don’t want it to be that way.	Wompɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I’m not here or there	M’ani nnye ho wɔ ha anaa ha
I brought him here.	Mede no baa ha.
This is the thing you need to do.	Eyi ne ade a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
I could believe that	Ná metumi agye saa asɛm no adi
He just told me.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ me ara kwa.
Other attempts end the same way.	Mmɔden foforo nso ba awiei saa ara.
That was our home.	Ná ɛno ne yɛn fie.
But I can’t do that.	Nanso mintumi nyɛ saa.
And you can actually see it.	Na wubetumi ahu ankasa.
I owe him everything	Mede biribiara ka no
I had no difficulty with it.	Ná ɛnyɛ den mma me wɔ ho.
That stuff is a big part of it.	Saa ade no yɛ ne fã kɛse.
That worked out really well.	Ɛno yɛɛ yiye ankasa.
It wasn’t a good idea for me.	Na ɛnyɛ adwene pa mma me.
There was nothing wrong with it.	Na mfomso biara nni ho.
No one even knows his name.	Obiara nnim ne din mpo.
I wish it was that easy	Me yam a anka ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa
However, that has actually happened.	Nanso, ɛno asi ankasa.
Around that time, anyway.	Bɛyɛ saa bere no, ɔkwan biara so.
But, as you say, you never know.	Nanso, sɛnea woka no, wunnim da.
It has a wide variety of features that are easy to use.	Ɛwɔ nneɛma ahorow pii a ɛnyɛ den sɛ wode bedi dwuma.
I saw how much you liked it last night	Mihuu sɛnea w’ani gyee ho anadwo a etwaam no
But think about it now.	Nanso susuw ho mprempren.
Just one more thing.	Ade biako pɛ bio.
It doesn’t work.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I think you can make me a lot of money	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi ayɛ sika pii ama me
It has and or.	Ɛwɔ ne anaa.
I think it will be long tonight	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ tenten anadwo yi
All of those things work.	Saa nneɛma no nyinaa yɛ adwuma.
I use it throughout our house.	Mede di dwuma wɔ yɛn fie nyinaa.
There are two reasons for this.	Nneɛma abien nti na ɛte saa.
Don’t even think about it.	Nsusuw ho mpo.
Mine would be worse, but again putting that aside.	Me de no bɛyɛ bɔne kɛse, nanso bio de saa asɛm no to nkyɛn.
But shoes are the first things.	Nanso mpaboa ne nneɛma a edi kan koraa.
I’m not really sure why.	Me ntumi nhu nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa.
I would never have been good enough for him	Anka menyɛ papa mma no da
I can’t give it anymore.	Mintumi mfa mma bio.
Without a doubt, it does.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
You have to believe in yourself and what you are doing.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wugye wo ho ne nea woreyɛ no di.
Play in a game.	Di agoru wɔ agoru bi mu.
That was important to him.	Ná ɛno ho hia no.
You’ll enjoy this.	W’ani begye eyi ho.
That’s why everything sounds as wonderful as it does.	Ɛno nti na biribiara te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa te sɛ nea ɛte no.
I’m very excited about it	M’ani gyee ho yiye
There are many issues to consider.	Nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
I couldn’t believe it had worked	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛ ayɛ adwuma
I really enjoyed this book	M’ani gyee nhoma yi ho yiye paa
We had problems.	Ná yɛwɔ ɔhaw ahorow.
Once he likes you, he likes you.	Sɛ n’ani gye wo ho pɛ a, n’ani gye wo ho.
What did he do with it.	Dɛn na ɔde yɛɛ.
It’s hard to.	Ɛyɛ den.
People need to act, and they need to act now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo yɛ ade, na ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ho biribi mprempren.
You know it’s okay.	Wunim sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee.
If you have one, remove it.	Sɛ wowɔ bi a, yi.
In a way, it is.	Ɔkwan bi so no.
It wasn’t like anyone was there to help.	Na ɛnyɛ sɛ obiara wɔ hɔ a ɔbɛboa.
A very awesome book.	Nhoma a ɛyɛ hu yiye.
Must be more than that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ pii ka ho sen saa.
I already have something in the works	Mewɔ biribi dedaw wɔ nnwuma no mu
I have used it in the past and it works well.	Mede adi dwuma bere a atwam no na ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
I glanced over to see if he saw them too	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ hɔ sɛ ɔno nso huu wɔn anaa
He illustrated the paper with pictures.	Ɔde mfonini ahorow yɛɛ krataa no ho mfonini.
I saw it recently.	Mihuu no nnansa yi ara.
I did know the information	Ná minim nsɛm no ampa
Don’t give him that power.	Mma no saa tumi no.
It’s full of.	Ɛyɛ ma.
And human disasters.	Na nnipa asiane ahorow nso.
I’m mentally stronger than anything.	M’adwene mu yɛ den sen biribiara.
We had some really good people there	Ná yɛwɔ nnipa pa ankasa bi wɔ hɔ
That’s a surprise.	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
The way he was.	Sɛnea na ɔte no.
I tell myself that things are not what they are	Meka kyerɛ me ho sɛ nneɛma nyɛ nea ɛte
Not that this is new.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ eyi yɛ ade foforo.
I agree with you there, man	Me ne wo yɛ adwene wɔ hɔ, ɔbarima
I turned my eyes away from him	Mede m’ani fii ne ho
It was indeed important.	Ná ɛho hia ampa.
I want to see my mother, badly	Mepɛ sɛ mihu me maame, bɔne
What it will be.	Nea ɛbɛyɛ.
And so does mine.	Na saa ara na me de no nso yɛ.
But this is a hopeful book.	Nanso eyi yɛ nhoma a anidaso wom.
They had been happy for a while.	Ná wɔn ani agye bere bi.
I have something important to say	Mewɔ biribi a ɛho hia a mɛka
It is unclear what the real danger is.	Ɛyɛ nea obiara nnim nea asiane ankasa no yɛ.
But there is no life.	Nanso nkwa biara nni hɔ.
That was his idea.	Ná ɛno ne n’adwene.
We have the group.	Yɛwɔ kuw no.
And that was a problem.	Na ɛno yɛ ɔhaw.
Many people agree with me.	Nnipa pii ne me yɛ adwene.
It has affected us too.	Aka yɛn nso.
You should have known.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu.
And it was good for him.	Na eye ma no.
You just never seem to do much of anything these days.	Ɛte sɛ nea wonyɛ hwee pii da nnansa yi ara kwa.
Maybe it was just him.	Ebia na ɛyɛ ɔno nkutoo.
He has done it before.	Wayɛ no pɛn.
It’s here.	Ɛwɔ ha.
I went with him anyway	Me ne no kɔɔ ɔkwan biara so
No one but .	Obiara nni hɔ a ɛnyɛ .
And I have the power.	Na me na mewɔ tumi no.
When the police come it’s all the same to them.	Sɛ polisifo ba a ne nyinaa yɛ ade koro ma wɔn.
One day to the next.	Da koro kosi da a edi hɔ no.
He knows my name.	Onim me din.
I knew he was for me	Ná minim sɛ ɔyɛ ma me
Meet the man behind the film.	Hu ɔbarima a ɔwɔ sini no akyi no.
The windows are still closed.	Mfɛnsere no da so ara to mu.
Not a good year by any means.	Ɛnyɛ afe pa ɔkwan biara so.
I’ve made up my mind.	Mayɛ adwene.
It may not be up to date in that case.	Ebia ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ nnɛ wɔ saa tebea no mu.
It seems simple enough.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I always loved his hands	Ná m’ani gye ne nsa ho bere nyinaa
We play with this.	Yɛde eyi di agoru.
Not either way regardless	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan abien no nyinaa so mfa ho
He was very perfect.	Ná ɔyɛ pɛ paa.
I never knew.	Minnim da.
Obviously not now.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ mprempren.
I expected it to be.	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I love that he always seems to touch me	M’ani gye ho sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɔde ne nsa ka me bere nyinaa
It didn’t matter to him.	Ná ɛnyɛ no asɛm.
I love all of these things	M’ani gye saa nneɛma yi nyinaa ho
I know it wasn’t.	Minim sɛ na ɛnte saa.
I really like the guy.	M’ani gye ɔbarima no ho ankasa.
This could be a go-to.	Eyi betumi ayɛ obi a ɔbɛkɔ.
The language, it’s more complicated.	Kasa no, ɛyɛ den sen saa.
He touched her hand.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne nsa.
And it was there.	Na ɛwɔ hɔ.
Something was going to happen.	Ná biribi bɛba.
He glanced at her hands and arms.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ ne nsa ne ne nsa.
And it didn’t matter.	Na ɛnyɛ hwee.
I have nothing but time	Minni hwee sɛ bere
But this is not a new problem.	Nanso eyi nyɛ ɔhaw foforo.
A man inside was apparently homeless	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɔbarima bi a ɔte mu no nni ofie
He is sitting on my bed.	Ɔte me mpa so.
I know where you are	Minim baabi a wowɔ
I’m excited.	M’ani agye.
He loved stories, and stories were told.	Ná n’ani gye nsɛm ho, na na wɔka nsɛm.
It will be quite the same with his only child.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛnea ɛte wɔ ne ba koro pɛ no ho koraa.
It only gets better from here.	Ɛyɛ yiye fi ha nkutoo.
It was just what he wanted.	Ná ɛyɛ nea na ɔpɛ ara kwa.
Expensive, but great.	Ne bo yɛ den, nanso ɛyɛ kɛse.
As far as he knew, he was alone.	Sɛnea na onim no, ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
I would greatly appreciate any help with this.	M’ani begye mmoa biara a wɔde bɛma wɔ eyi ho no ho kɛse.
I completely disagree with that	Me ne saa asɛm no nyɛ adwene koraa
Almost not even that.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ saa mpo.
He has my support.	Ɔwɔ me mmoa.
He had no intention of using this name.	Ná onni adwene sɛ ɔde saa din yi adi dwuma.
I’m happy every day	M’ani agye da biara da
It was once one.	Ná bere bi na ɛyɛ biako.
There is nothing else.	Biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
Not their mother.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn maame.
It wasn’t a very good picture.	Na ɛnyɛ mfonini a eye koraa.
Take what you want.	Fa nea wopɛ.
This seems to be an important point.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ asɛm a ɛho hia.
He sits on the other bed.	Ɔte mpa foforo no so.
That problem can be anything.	Saa ɔhaw no betumi ayɛ nea ɛte biara.
I kind of looked up at him	Mede ɔkwan bi so maa m’ani so hwɛɛ no
Just do the test.	Yɛ sɔhwɛ no ara kwa.
Let’s not forget.	Yɛn werɛ mfi.
But that animal also thinks.	Nanso saa aboa no nso susuw nneɛma ho.
Time to do what you do right.	Bere a ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ nea woyɛ no yiye.
I think that does complicate it a bit	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ma ɛyɛ den kakra ampa
I am the only one left	Me nkutoo na aka
They are for everyone.	Wɔyɛ ma obiara.
I thought it was beautiful	Ná misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ
I can come here for you.	Metumi aba ha ama wo.
That sounds like a reason to have a party to me.	Ɛno te sɛ nea enti a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ apontow ma me.
I think about it a lot	Misusuw ho pii
I want to do a study with you	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo yɛ adesua
It wasn’t the way it was.	Ɛnyɛ sɛnea na ɛte no.
I never knew music could do that to you	Na minnim da sɛ nnwom betumi ayɛ wo saa
This was another day at work for us.	Ná eyi yɛ da foforo wɔ adwumam ma yɛn.
But it certainly doesn’t feel that way.	Nanso akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛnte nka saa.
One night, he felt better.	Anadwo bi, ne ho tɔɔ no.
I signed with them.	Me ne wɔn de wɔn nsa hyɛɛ ase.
Everything seemed to go wrong.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea biribiara ankɔ yiye.
You're just scared.	Wo suro ara kwa.
I don’t agree with him	Me ne no nyɛ adwene
That sounds like a great weekend.	Ɛno te sɛ dapɛn awiei kɛse bi.
I have committed many sins	Mayɛ bɔne pii
I got about three of those this morning	Me nsa kaa saa pii no bɛyɛ abiɛsa anɔpa yi
I'm not sure why it doesn't work.	Me nnim nea enti a ɛnyɛ adwuma.
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
A story you know well	Asɛm bi a wunim yiye
He is very large.	Ɔyɛ kɛse paa.
I think he thought he had forgotten something	Misusuw sɛ na osusuw sɛ ne werɛ afi biribi
I had to think about it.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho.
I did and he didn’t like it	Meyɛɛ saa na n’ani nnye ho
That’s the nature of that story.	Ɛno ne saa asɛm no su.
Everyone has to accept it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obiara gye tom.
I can't be into him, either	Mintumi nyɛ ne mu, nso
He likes to do that from time to time.	N’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa bere ne bere mu.
I miss being alone in the car	Mepa bere a me nkutoo wɔ kar mu no
I hope he can keep up with us	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ obetumi ne yɛn akɔ so
I had to look away from that	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ m’ani so fi saa asɛm no ho
I just can’t do that right now	Mintumi nyɛ saa mprempren ara kɛkɛ
This is my take on that.	Eyi ne me fa wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Isn’t that to give them some.	So ɛnyɛ sɛ wɔde bi bɛma wɔn.
For me it was just an idea.	Wɔ me fam no na ɛyɛ adwene bi kɛkɛ.
I know what you can do	Minim nea wubetumi ayɛ
We do it for kids.	Yɛyɛ ma mmofra.
I can’t say for sure.	Mintumi nka no yiye.
And if not, why not?.	Na sɛ ɛnte saa a, dɛn nti na ɛnte saa?.
I’m not happy every day	M’ani nnye da biara da
Lots of songs.	Nnwom pii.
He knew he could do it.	Ná onim sɛ obetumi ayɛ.
I thought about it quickly.	Misusuw ho ntɛmntɛm.
I guess he didn’t like it	Misusuw sɛ na n’ani nnye ho
I saw something in you	Mihuu biribi wɔ wo mu
I will definitely take you to your mother	Mede wo bɛkɔ wo maame nkyɛn ampa
As a human being.	Sɛ́ onipa.
He was in his bedroom.	Ná ɔwɔ ne mpa so.
Multiple applications.	Nneɛma pii a wɔde di dwuma.
They are with us.	Wɔn ne yɛn wɔ hɔ.
You are just terrible.	Woyɛ hu ara kwa.
Many people wanted a piece of it	Ná nnipa pii pɛ ne fã bi
But I don’t know how to do it.	Nanso me nnim sɛnea mɛyɛ.
However, the story goes beyond that.	Nanso, asɛm no kɔ akyiri sen saa.
This is not the case.	Eyi nyɛ saa.
A team that doesn’t care about the final game	Kuw a ɛnyɛ agoru a etwa to no ho hwee
I really didn’t know what to do.	Ankasa na minnim nea menyɛ.
I almost did it again	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ meyɛɛ saa bio
It was kind of easy, walking like that.	Na ɛyɛ mmerɛw ɔkwan bi so, nantew saa.
It was very beautiful.	Ná ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
Ma took my hand.	Ma faa me nsa.
But maybe you have something.	Nanso ebia wowɔ biribi.
I felt it but I didn’t care	Metee nka nanso na ɛho nhia me
I want to know about this happening.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu eyi a ɛrekɔ so no ho asɛm.
I had to figure out what was going on.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so.
I know how much you want to know	Minim sɛnea wopɛ sɛ wuhu no kɛse
I think we should do it as soon as possible	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ no ntɛm ara sɛnea yebetumi
He was planning all of this.	Ná ɔreyɛ eyi nyinaa ho nhyehyɛe.
Night or day.	Anadwo anaa awia.
But he knew how they hurt.	Nanso na onim sɛnea na wɔn ho yɛ wɔn yaw.
I have back problems to	Mewɔ akyi haw ahorow to
That leads to a lot of different issues.	Ɛno de nsɛm ahorow pii ba.
Maybe, one day one of us will be famous.	Ebia, da bi yɛn mu biako begye din.
I can’t have it my way	Mintumi nnya no me kwan so
You are well, you are beautiful.	Wo ho nyɛ wo den, wo ho yɛ fɛ.
It’s not the same thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade koro no ara.
But just be careful.	Nanso hwɛ yiye kɛkɛ.
But he doesn’t.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa.
This seems like a big trend.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ ade kɛse a ɛrekɔ so.
I was all wrong about you	Na me nyinaa di mfomso wɔ wo ho
Thank you, folks.	Meda mo ase, nkurɔfo.
I have already done that	Me nso mayɛ saa dedaw
But there was nothing behind the door.	Nanso na biribiara nni ɔpon no akyi.
It’s only been a month.	Ɔsram biako pɛ ni.
I really like this guy	M’ani gye saa ɔbarima yi ho ankasa
I still shouldn’t be here	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meda so ara ba ha
The excitement began to build.	Anigye no fii ase yɛɛ kɛse.
But no literary work exists in a vacuum.	Nanso nhoma adwuma biara nni hɔ a ɛwɔ baabi a hwee nni.
You do something.	Woyɛ biribi.
That’s why he does it.	Ɛno nti na ɔyɛ saa.
You had to know how much it hurt.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu sɛnea ɛyɛ yaw kɛse.
Make sure you manage your time.	Hwɛ sɛnea wode wo bere bedi dwuma yiye.
I was working night shift that month	Ná meyɛ adwuma anadwo adwuma saa ɔsram no
You know it’s too late.	Wunim sɛ aka akyi dodo.
Just like her mother.	Te sɛ ne maame ara pɛ.
I should have looked at him	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ no
There has been a mistake somewhere.	Mfomso bi aba wɔ baabi.
So, so it’s very interesting.	Enti, enti ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
I think you'd better come with me	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ wo ne me bɛba
I want to do something	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi
All my hands are up.	Me nsa nyinaa so.
I really want to go home.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ fie ampa.
You are just too fast.	Woyɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo ara kwa.
I didn't know why.	Ná minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
I could go there with them	Ná metumi ne wɔn akɔ hɔ
I love the way they talk with their eyes	M’ani gye sɛnea wɔde wɔn ani kasa no ho
That’s what we do.	Ɛno ne nea yɛyɛ.
I really wanted to get to know him better	Ná mepɛ paa sɛ mihu no yiye
He had a successful career.	Ná ɔwɔ adwuma bi a edi mu.
I couldn’t quite believe it	Ná mintumi nnye nni koraa
Many of them don’t understand.	Wɔn mu pii nte ase.
I was alone in my thoughts	Ná me nkutoo na mewɔ m’adwene
I was surprised at how good it looked	Sɛnea na ɛte sɛ nea eye no yɛɛ me nwonwa
The same is true.	Saa ara na ɛte.
I could use some of my clothes	Ná metumi de me ntade no bi adi dwuma
This is a sign of weakness.	Eyi kyerɛ sɛ obi ayɛ mmerɛw.
They cover all kinds of interesting music.	Wɔka nnwom ahorow a ɛyɛ anigye nyinaa ho asɛm.
He looked like a child.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ abofra.
Everything works fine.	Biribiara yɛ adwuma yiye.
He hoped it was.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
I know this is a terrible idea	Minim sɛ eyi yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ hu
Winter is a bit better.	Awɔw bere mu yɛ papa kakra.
I couldn’t hear anything from them	Na mintumi nte hwee mfi wɔn hɔ
I want to go for a walk there	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ nantew kɔ hɔ
There is a lot of information available.	Nsɛm pii wɔ hɔ a ɛwɔ hɔ.
I just feel bad for it.	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ me yaw ara kwa.
One reason is crucial.	Ade biako nti a ɛte saa no ho hia kɛse.
It was just a helping hand.	Ná ɛyɛ mmoa a wɔde di dwuma ara kwa.
Maybe he’ll give them away.	Ebia ɔde wɔn bɛma.
I doubt it.	Migye ho kyim.
As you might do.	Sɛnea ebia wobɛyɛ no.
I really like you both too	M’ani gye mo baanu nso ho paa
But it doesn’t work.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma.
I can’t drive anymore	Mintumi nka kar bio
No one knows this.	Obiara nnim eyi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Asɛm biara nka ho.
If you really know how to use it.	Sɛ wunim sɛnea wode bedi dwuma ampa a.
He did that every night.	Ná ɔyɛ saa anadwo biara.
I couldn’t say anything	Na mintumi nka hwee
And it was dangerous.	Na ɛyɛ nea asiane wom.
Maybe the movie is too old.	Ebia na sini no akyɛ dodo.
Clearly, it is a serious threat to them.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛyɛ asiane kɛse ma wɔn.
After that it’s hard.	Ɛno akyi no ɛyɛ den.
I can only do so much	Nneɛma pii nkutoo na metumi ayɛ
I want to do this quite quickly if we can.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ eyi ntɛmntɛm koraa sɛ yebetumi a.
That was very important to him.	Ná ɛno ho hia no kɛse.
I would work for you anyway	Anka mɛyɛ adwuma ama wo ɔkwan biara so
I had to take care of my mind	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ m’adwene so
They are beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
I took good care of them	Ná mehwɛ wɔn yiye
I have a lot of learning to do	Mewɔ adesua pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ
Make the girl happy.	Ma abeawa no ani nnye.
They gave it to him	Wɔde maa no
The story is nothing	Asɛm no nyɛ hwee
I just have to bring that to the table	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede saa asɛm no ba pon no so ara kwa
You’ll be surprised.	Ɛbɛyɛ wo nwonwa.
The police took him aside.	Polisifo de no too nkyɛn.
If you really want to.	Sɛ wopɛ ampa a.
Use it to do what you want.	Fa yɛ nea wopɛ.
At least that’s what it looked like.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte.
You know and this is the first time.	Wunim na eyi ne bere a edi kan.
I want you to be with me	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me wɔ hɔ
This has nothing to do with you.	Eyi ne wo nni hwee yɛ.
Not good enough.	Ɛnyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I think you do something else	Misusuw sɛ woyɛ biribi foforo
However, I can’t say	Nanso, mintumi nka
I’m a sinner.	Meyɛ bɔne.
Just hang up the phone.	Fa telefon no to nkyɛn kɛkɛ.
He was the one who had to figure these things out.	Ɔno na na ɛsɛ sɛ osusuw saa nneɛma yi ho.
I wanted to make sure that	Ná mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ hu sɛ
The squirrel didn’t come.	Ɔkraman amma.
Man is a great animal.	Onipa yɛ aboa kɛse.
And it is true that many people show off their work.	Na ɛyɛ nokware sɛ nnipa pii de wɔn adwuma kyerɛ wɔn ho.
And, in a way, it was.	Na, ɔkwan bi so no, na ɛte saa.
This may or may not have been true.	Ebia na eyi yɛ nokware anaasɛ ɛnyɛ nokware.
I can put it in tomorrow	Metumi de ahyɛ mu ɔkyena
That’s a game.	Ɛno yɛ agoru.
This seemed strange.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ nwonwa.
That’s right, your hands are there.	Ɛte saa, wo nsa wɔ hɔ.
I don’t even know what’s good for me.	Minnim nea eye ma me mpo.
Another unfamiliar situation fascinates him.	Tebea foforo a onnim no ma n’ani gye ho.
I couldn’t do these things	Na mintumi nyɛ saa nneɛma yi
But good quality.	Nanso su pa.
We had to be that hopeful.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa anidaso no.
Not for a very long time.	Ɛnyɛ bere tenten paa.
And the hand fell off.	Na nsa no hwee ase.
I just want you to take him to them	Mepɛ sɛ wode no kɔ wɔn nkyɛn kɛkɛ
He should have acted now.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ade mprempren.
But not now, not now.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mprempren, ɛnyɛ mprempren.
Thanks again for the help.	Meda wo ase bio wɔ mmoa no ho.
You can’t control this.	Worentumi nni eyi so.
I must be terrible, and it hurts so much	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ho yɛ hu, na ɛyɛ me yaw kɛse
It was later than he thought.	Ná ɛyɛ akyiri sen sɛnea na osusuw no.
They were about the same length.	Na wɔn tenten bɛyɛ sɛ saa ara.
First to essentials.	Nea edi kan kosi nea ɛho hia so.
I really like this guy	M’ani gye saa ɔbarima yi ho ankasa
You, me, everyone.	Wo, me, obiara.
I have a father.	Mewɔ papa.
On paper it looked fantastic.	Wɔ krataa so no na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Can someone find it please?.	So obi betumi ahu no mesrɛ wo?.
He just wanted it all to be over.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ne nyinaa ba awiei ara kwa.
It wasn’t a bad language.	Na ɛnyɛ kasa bɔne.
I still play it from time to time	Meda so ara bɔ no bere ne bere mu
I was pretty good at it	Ná me ho akokwaw yiye wɔ mu
It was an amazing performance.	Ná ɛyɛ agoru a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I really need to tell you something	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribi kyerɛ wo ankasa
He was in grave danger.	Ná ɔwɔ asiane kɛse mu.
Keep lying to yourself.	Kɔ so di atoro kyerɛ wo ho.
But that was a long time ago.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
At least not much.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ pii.
The house is still there.	Ofie no da so ara wɔ hɔ.
But again, you have to confine them, engage them.	Nanso bio, ɛsɛ sɛ wode wɔn to afiase, wode wɔn ho hyɛ mu.
I told you, things are just hard for me	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ, nneɛma mu yɛ den ara kwa ma me
I put my arm around her.	Mede ne nsa bɔɔ ne nkyɛn.
I hope you feel better soon	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wo ho bɛtɔ wo ntɛm
During that time you’re happy and he’s gone.	Saa bere no mu no w’ani gye na ɔno nso nni hɔ.
I think you could have done better.	Misusuw sɛ anka wubetumi ayɛ nea eye sen saa.
A method is needed	Ɔkwan bi ho hia
I did a quick test and the below worked	Meyɛɛ sɔhwɛ ntɛmntɛm na nea ɛwɔ ase ha no yɛɛ adwuma
There was nothing left.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a aka.
I'm late.	Meda akyiri.
I had nothing	Ná minni hwee
I hadn’t worked with him before	Ná me ne no nyɛ adwuma kan
That’s what the conference is about.	Ɛno ne nea nhyiam no fa ho.
He must be the last.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nea etwa to.
It looked like everything important.	Ná ɛte sɛ biribiara a ɛho hia.
It’s a thrill.	Ɛyɛ anigye.
We will do this and that for you.	Yɛbɛyɛ eyi ne saa ama wo.
Everyone there knows too.	Obiara a ɔwɔ hɔ nso nim.
That’s what’s important.	Ɛno ne nea ɛho hia.
It was amazing.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa.
They all felt it.	Wɔn nyinaa tee nka.
I wondered what it would be like	Misusuw sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ ho
But if it is successful.	Nanso sɛ ɛyɛ yiye a.
I understand human sexuality	Mete nnipa nna ho asɛm ase
Do this and this.	Yɛ eyi ne eyi.
I couldn’t hear anything	Ná mintumi nte hwee
That would have been very smart.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ nyansa kɛse.
You are not his mother.	Wonyɛ ne maame.
I missed you so much	Me werɛ fii wo kɛse
I will give that to him.	Mede saa bɛma no.
It’s like everything else.	Ɛte sɛ biribiara.
The news came too late.	Asɛm no baa akyiri dodo.
I apologize for that.	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ ho.
I see them every day	Mihu wɔn da biara da
Not this movie though.	Ɛnyɛ sini yi de, nanso.
He doesn't seem to do anything.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔnyɛ hwee.
I don’t even know what happened.	Minnim nea esii mpo.
There were to be no other consequences.	Na ɛnsɛ sɛ nneɛma foforo biara fi mu ba.
He didn’t want you to think about them.	Na ɔmpɛ sɛ wususuw wɔn ho.
This may be a test for you.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ sɔhwɛ ama wo.
I couldn’t save his life	Na mintumi nnye ne nkwa
I can handle it from here on out	Metumi adi ho dwuma afi ha rekɔ
I have to forget everything about that	Ɛsɛ sɛ me werɛ fi biribiara wɔ ɛno ho
I just want to be with you again.	Nea mepɛ ara ne sɛ mɛka mo ho bio.
It’s every day.	Ɛyɛ da biara da.
But that’s the problem.	Nanso ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
The way he was.	Sɛnea na ɔte.
This is a true story.	Eyi yɛ nokware.
They were beautiful.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
I felt terrible about that and wanted to go	Metee nka sɛ ɛyɛ hu wɔ saa asɛm no ho na na mepɛ sɛ mekɔ
I think this is the end of the road	Misusuw sɛ eyi ne ɔkwan no awiei
His team was in a bad way.	Ná ne kuw no wɔ ɔkwan bɔne so.
I couldn’t help myself	Na mintumi nnye me ho
You don’t want to know, either.	Wompɛ sɛ wuhu, nso.
I don’t think of anything at all	Minsusuw hwee ho koraa
I thought that was wonderful	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa
I wouldn’t want him to	Anka mempɛ sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa
Play the long game.	Di agoru tenten no.
And, it was definitely a good idea.	Na, akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛyɛ adwene pa.
I’m very excited about this.	M’ani agye eyi ho yiye.
Maybe you have them.	Ebia wowɔ wɔn.
I headed for the front door	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ anim pon no ano
Just two years later.	Mfe abien pɛ akyi.
I thought it was too scary for everyone	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ hu dodo ma obiara
But it was here.	Nanso na ɛwɔ ha.
A man shouldn’t be a problem	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔbarima yɛ ɔhaw
The back was too low.	Ná akyi no aba fam dodo.
The big gun fired again.	Tuo kɛse no san too tuo bio.
I could go alone.	Ná me nkutoo metumi akɔ.
I saw what no one else did	Mihuu nea obi foforo anyɛ
People say terrible things.	Nkurɔfo ka nsɛm a ɛyɛ hu.
But we will do it right.	Nanso yɛbɛyɛ no yiye.
I didn’t know he was that young.	Ná minnim sɛ ɔyɛ abofra saa.
And, indeed, full of power.	Na, ampa ara, tumi ahyɛ mu ma.
I want to talk to you and your wife	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo ne wo yere kasa
I can’t take him home.	Mintumi mfa no nkɔ fie.
The car, maybe not.	Kar no, ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
But look at me below.	Nanso hwɛ me wɔ ase hɔ.
I think he did that.	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
I have other plans though	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe foforo de, nanso
They had been used.	Ná wɔde adi dwuma.
And it feels like that’s true.	Na ɛte nka sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware.
I really like you too	Me nso mepɛ wo ankasa
But the story offers more than just this.	Nanso asɛm no de pii ma sen eyi ara kwa.
There was little else he could do.	Ná nneɛma foforo kakraa bi na obetumi ayɛ.
I need to look into that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ saa asɛm no.
That’s just a name.	Ɛno yɛ din bi kɛkɛ.
Not as good as a real book though.	Ɛnyɛ papa te sɛ nhoma ankasa de, nanso.
I don’t like anything about you.	M’ani nnye wo ho biribiara ho.
Again, this is nothing new.	Bio nso, eyi nyɛ ade foforo.
So it’s good.	Enti ɛyɛ papa.
I had to admit, she loved it	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ migye tom sɛ, na n’ani gye ho
I hope we can start now	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ yebetumi afi ase mprempren
But it’s not just about paying.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ka kɛkɛ so.
I could not see any problem	Ná mintumi nhu ɔhaw biara
I couldn’t get in but that didn’t matter	Na mintumi nkɔ mu nanso na ɛno ho nhia
Which we only have to do for one more week.	Nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ no dapɛn biako bio nkutoo.
And a terrible person.	Na onipa a ne ho yɛ hu.
I don’t know, but maybe it will.	Minnim, nanso ebia ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Make the most of your path.	Fa wo kwan no di dwuma yiye.
I was worried about us on the way.	Ná yɛn ho asɛm haw me wɔ kwan so.
I think this is very important	Misusuw sɛ eyi ho hia yiye
I had to go inside	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ mu
Perhaps there is a better way.	Ebia ɔkwan a eye sen saa wɔ hɔ.
I can bring them here	Metumi de wɔn aba ha
The money would come.	Ná sika no bɛba.
Age matters.	Mfe a obi adi ho hia.
He plays it as much as he can.	Ɔbɔ no sɛnea obetumi.
I thought it would be interesting.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
We are here for the music.	Yɛwɔ ha ma nnwom no.
I can’t say tomorrow	Mintumi nka sɛ ɔkyena
I wanted to surprise them	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ wɔn nwonwa
I can’t understand him	Mintumi nte ne ase
Eventually, though, it will.	Nanso, awiei koraa no, ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I think he only did it to impress you	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a w’ani begye wo ho nkutoo
We do it all the time.	Yɛyɛ no bere nyinaa.
I’d love to do it	M’ani begye ho sɛ mɛyɛ
A terrible, terrible mistake.	Mfomso a ɛyɛ hu, ɛyɛ hu.
I forgot to include it in the other article	Me werɛ fii sɛ mede bɛka asɛm foforo no ho
I was out there.	Ná mewɔ abɔnten hɔ.
Believe me, this is rare.	Gye me di, eyi ho yɛ na.
They have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I love the opportunity	M’ani gye hokwan no ho
I was a little too quick	Ná meyɛ ntɛm dodo kakra
That’s great, that’s good.	Ɛno yɛ kɛse, ɛyɛ papa.
It’s all part of the game, you know.	Ne nyinaa yɛ agoru no fã, wunim.
There was one almost every day.	Na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biako wɔ hɔ da biara.
He hoped that would happen soon.	Ná ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛno bɛba nnansa yi ara.
It’s just faster that way.	Ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm ara kwa saa kwan no so.
I really felt stronger	Metee nka ankasa sɛ me ho ayɛ den
But you can check it out.	Nanso wubetumi ahwɛ mu.
I was working.	Ná mereyɛ adwuma.
And they might even be something else now.	Na ebia na wɔyɛ biribi foforo mpo mprempren.
Let man sleep when he can.	Ma onipa nna bere a obetumi.
We have all day tomorrow for that.	Yɛwɔ da mũ nyinaa ɔkyena ma ɛno.
I want her to be as happy as possible	Mepɛ sɛ n’ani gye sɛnea obetumi biara
But nothing worked out for me.	Nanso biribiara anyɛ yiye amma me.
I’m so excited about it	M’ani agye ho kɛse
I was living hand to mouth.	Ná mete ase nsa ne ano.
I think this idea goes a long way	Misusuw sɛ saa adwene yi kɔ akyiri yiye
I’m immediately impressed.	M’ani gye ho ntɛm ara.
I felt more alone than ever	Metee nka sɛ me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ sen bere biara
It’s just great.	Ɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa.
The decision was made unanimously.	Wɔde adwene koro sii gyinae no.
More details here and my thoughts below.	Nsɛm pii wɔ ha ne m’adwene wɔ ase ha.
I must be hearing something.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mete asɛm bi.
I didn’t want anyone to be afraid of me	Ná mempɛ sɛ obi suro me
Which is a bad thing.	Nea ɛyɛ ade bɔne.
Everyone makes movies.	Obiara yɛ sini.
I think you owe me that at least	Misusuw sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, wode me ka saa
And that was amazing.	Na ɛno yɛ nwonwa.
The man was out of his head.	Ná ɔbarima no afi ne ti so.
And each of them for him.	Na wɔn mu biara ma no.
He had his hands on his head.	Ná wɔde ne nsa ahyɛ ne ti so.
I expected everything but not this	Ná mehwɛ biribiara kwan nanso ɛnyɛ eyi
Sit down and rent down.	Tra ase na fa dan ka fam.
I want to know something about you	Mepɛ sɛ mihu biribi fa wo ho
For both ways.	Ɔkwan abien no nyinaa ho.
But that’s not the end of the story.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no awiei.
He wasn’t really.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa ankasa.
They are such wonderful people.	Wɔyɛ nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa saa.
He has to tell it all.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka ne nyinaa.
I feel so much older now	Mete nka sɛ me mfe akɔ anim kɛse mprempren
This is a very simple thing.	Eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
It’s his team.	Ɛyɛ ne kuw no.
I think he knew.	Misusuw sɛ na onim.
I know exactly what you do	Minim nea woyɛ no yiye
I wonder what it all means	Misusuw nea ne nyinaa kyerɛ ho
I can’t give dinner.	Mintumi mma anwummere aduan.
As you can see.	Sɛnea wubetumi ahu no.
I know where he’s headed	Minim baabi a ɔde n’ani kyerɛ
I know and he knows	Minim na ɔno nso nim
No wonder he likes me more than you do.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ n’ani gye me ho sen wo.
I’m interested in that	M’ani gye saa asɛm no ho
You don’t know me either.	Wo nso wunnim me.
Things feel pretty good.	Nneɛma te nka sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
They seem very happy to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani agye yiye ma me.
I should have said something sooner	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribi ntɛm
I was in charge here	Ná me na mehwɛ so wɔ ha
She was even beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ mpo.
Maybe I'm more overwhelmed	Ebia na me ho ayɛ me hyew kɛse
I had completely forgotten about that	Ná me werɛ afi saa asɛm no koraa
Too many times.	Mpɛn pii dodo.
It was production.	Ná ɛyɛ nneɛma a wɔyɛ.
So no one does nothing to anyone.	Enti obiara nni hɔ a ɔnyɛ obiara hwee.
I do a lot of them	Meyɛ wɔn pii
Apparently, his was not.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ne de no nyɛ saa.
For that matter.	Wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I found myself in it.	Mihuu me ho wɔ mu.
I think there is potential	Misusuw sɛ tumi wɔ hɔ
The hind legs gave me a lot of trouble.	Nan a ɛwɔ akyi no maa me haw kɛse.
Which was fine by us.	Nea na ɛyɛ papa wɔ yɛn fam.
Too much of both.	Nneɛma abien no nyinaa dodow dodo.
We were very impressed with the layout.	Yɛn ani gyee nhyehyɛe a wɔde sii hɔ no ho yiye.
A few more hours or something.	Nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi bio anaa biribi a ɛte saa.
Anything can happen.	Biribiara betumi asi.
Often he really wanted to	Mpɛn pii no na ɔpɛ ankasa
And the police are involved.	Na polisifo de wɔn ho ahyɛ mu.
A lot of people the simplest things in the long run.	Nnipa pii nneɛma a ɛnyɛ den koraa wɔ bere tenten mu.
I never should have been in that situation	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mekɔ saa tebea no mu da
I get them every year	Me nsa ka wɔn afe biara
It’s just us being us.	Ɛyɛ yɛn a yɛyɛ yɛn ara kwa.
Take a look for yourself below.	Fa wo ho hwɛ wɔ ase hɔ.
Just do something.	Yɛ biribi kɛkɛ.
He was home again.	Ná ɔwɔ fie bio.
See more details below.	Hwɛ nsɛm pii wɔ ase hɔ.
Can you overcome it.	So wubetumi adi so nkonim.
There must be a mistake.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mfomso bi wɔ hɔ.
I knew he would be fine	Ná minim sɛ ne ho bɛtɔ no
Reach out to people.	Fa wo nsa ka nkurɔfo nsa.
A picture or a book.	Mfonini anaa nhoma bi.
He was already in a state of shock.	Ná ɔwɔ tebea a ɛyɛ hu mu dedaw.
I thought it was interesting	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ anigye
But walking changes my mind.	Nanso nantew ma m’adwene dan.
I really enjoyed it	M’ani gyee hɔ paa
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani gyee ho paa.
That’s half true.	Ɛno yɛ nokware fã.
I actually had one.	Ná mewɔ bi ankasa.
I knew it had it for me	Ná minim sɛ ɛwɔ ma me
It is important enough.	Ɛho hia sɛnea ɛsɛ.
He was in grave danger.	Ná ɔwɔ asiane kɛse mu.
I wonder if he knows if mom works here	Misusuw sɛ ebia onim sɛ ebia maame yɛ adwuma wɔ ha anaa
A very long time indeed	Bere tenten paa ampa
I always wondered how he did this	Bere nyinaa na misusuw sɛnea ɔyɛɛ eyi ho
No one knows that better than he does.	Obiara nnim saa asɛm no yiye sen no.
I still keep myself in shape.	Meda so ara ma me ho kɔ so tra tebea pa mu.
That was the two of us.	Ná ɛno ne yɛn baanu.
There was something else.	Na biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
I make those songs for me	Meyɛ saa nnwom no ma me
Eventually, we will be able to raise funds for the project once it stabilizes.	Awiei koraa no, yebetumi anya sika ama adwuma no bere a ayɛ nea ɛyɛ den no.
I hope we get better	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ yɛn ho bɛtɔ yɛn
I have no power to do that	Minni tumi biara sɛ mɛyɛ saa
Their hands and feet can feel cold.	Wɔn nsa ne wɔn nan tumi te awɔw nka.
And maybe not for long.	Na ebia ɛnyɛ bere tenten.
I always wanted to taste him	Ná mewɔ ɔpɛ bere nyinaa sɛ mɛka ne ho ahwɛ
I have given myself to them	Mede me ho ama wɔn
I just want to watch it more often.	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ no mpɛn pii ara kwa.
I knew what he was doing.	Ná minim nea ɔreyɛ.
I was as shocked as anyone	Me ho dwiriw me te sɛ obiara
It is a busy time.	Ɛyɛ bere a nnipa pii kɔ hɔ.
I felt like a monster	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ aboa kɛse
This was new to me.	Ná eyi yɛ foforo ma me.
I still don’t do that today	Meda so ara nyɛ saa nnɛ
A man could only do so much	Ná ɔbarima bi betumi ayɛ pii saa nkutoo
I hope it works out somehow.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye ɔkwan bi so.
I plan to do the same thing this year	Meyɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mɛyɛ saa ara afe yi
We have a lot of time.	Yɛwɔ bere pii.
I’m glad you like it	M’ani agye sɛ w’ani gye ho
He put a note under their table.	Ɔde krataa bi hyɛɛ wɔn pon ase.
I couldn’t believe it would ever be the same	Na mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa ara da bi
We have control over them for a long time.	Yɛwɔ wɔn so tumi akyɛ.
Use it wisely in every situation.	Fa di dwuma yiye wɔ tebea biara mu.
I expect the dog brought them inside	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ kraman no de wɔn baa mu
I almost fainted	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ me ho yɛɛ me hyew
It looks very interesting.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
I stepped on the floor below	Mede me nan sii fam wɔ ase hɔ
Not that it really matters.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛho hia ankasa.
No one thing is more important than another.	Ade biara nni hɔ a ɛho hia sen foforo.
I can’t think of anyone else	Mintumi nsusuw obi foforo biara ho
However, this is not really the case.	Nanso, eyi nte saa ankasa.
I'm with you.	Me ne wo.
But there’s more to the game than you think.	Nanso pii wɔ agoru no mu sen sɛnea wususuw.
A house is just a house	Ofie yɛ ofie ara kwa
I loved that shot.	Ná m’ani gye saa tuo no ho.
I was doing that.	Ná meyɛ saa.
This shouldn’t really be surprising.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa ankasa.
In order to tell the story.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a ɔbɛka asɛm no.
Not my mother.	Ɛnyɛ me maame.
I couldn’t imagine it	Na mintumi nsusuw ho
I told myself that he or anyone else didn’t care	Meka kyerɛɛ me ho sɛ ɔno anaa obi foforo biara mfa ne ho
Those years have generally been good.	Mpɛn pii no, saa mfe no ayɛ papa.
They were also excruciatingly painful.	Ná wɔyɛ yaw a ɛyɛ yaw nso.
A man approached me with one hand.	Ɔbarima bi a ɔde ne nsa biako baa me nkyɛn.
Many things happened during this time.	Nneɛma pii sii wɔ saa bere yi mu.
I find this fascinating	Mihu sɛ eyi yɛ anigye
The next thing	Ade a edi hɔ .
However, a dog lives to please himself	Nanso, ɔkraman tra ase ma n’ani gye ne ho
The bed was hard, but not as hard as the floor.	Ná mpa no yɛ den, nanso na ɛnyɛ den te sɛ fam no.
I should like that	Ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani gye saa asɛm no ho
I couldn’t tell anyone how to do it	Na mintumi nkyerɛ obiara sɛnea ɔbɛyɛ
Not that you would.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ anka wobɛyɛ saa.
Clearly, something was wrong.	Ɛda adi sɛ na biribi anyɛ yiye koraa wɔ hɔ.
Which is difficult, but a plan nonetheless	Nea ɛyɛ den, nanso nhyehyɛe bi ne nyinaa akyi
He has two problems in this case.	Ɔwɔ ɔhaw abien wɔ asɛm yi mu.
I spent an afternoon with him	Me ne no dii awia biako
There is a time to be quick as well.	Bere bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ ntɛm nso.
I didn't know what you meant.	Na minnim sɛ wopɛ sɛ woka.
Good news and all that	Asɛm pa ne ne nyinaa
The full letter is below.	Krataa mũ no nyinaa wɔ ase ha.
It would be difficult.	Ná ɛbɛyɛ den.
He put it down.	Ɔde too fam.
I thought this was a good idea	Misusuwii sɛ eyi yɛ adwene pa
It is not perfect.	Ɛnyɛ nea edi mũ.
Not good, not bad.	Ɛnyɛ papa, ɛnyɛ bɔne.
There is a book somewhere.	Nhoma bi wɔ hɔ wɔ baabi.
But it really works.	Nanso ɛyɛ adwuma ankasa.
I had to keep busy	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so di adagyew
I want to take good care of them	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ wɔn yiye
The time is not important.	Bere no ho nhia.
They were very happy	Ná wɔn ani gye paa
Now, I can finally go to school	Seesei, awiei koraa no, metumi akɔ sukuu
Or the money could go elsewhere.	Anaasɛ sika no betumi akɔ baabi foforo.
I wish he knew how to do it.	Me yam a anka onim sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
I completely understand this.	Mete eyi ase koraa.
I think that’s a great idea	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ adwene kɛse
I love being inside you	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ wo mu
It doesn’t have to be long, or even comprehensive.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ tenten, anaasɛ ɛyɛ nea edi mũ mpo.
So, this system is very simple.	Enti, nhyehyɛe yi yɛ mmerɛw yiye.
Look at something else.	Hwɛ biribi foforo.
After all, I didn’t really know him	Ne nyinaa akyi no, na minnim no ankasa
Which is kind of a complicated thing.	Nea ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ den bi.
I found something even better	Mihuu biribi a eye sen saa mpo
It’s what he wants.	Ɛyɛ ɔno na ɔpɛ.
I have to go.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ.
I wanted you all to be here	Ná mepɛ sɛ mo nyinaa ba ha
The truth comes true.	Nokware no ba mu.
Got it a few days ago, it works great.	Nyaa no nna kakraa bi a atwam ni, ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse.
An idea had been at work here	Ná adwene bi ayɛ adwuma wɔ ha
The problem is that this is not entirely true.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
As quickly as possible.	Ntɛmntɛm sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye biara.
I have very little time	Bere kakraa bi pɛ na mewɔ
Knowing he shouldn’t.	Nim a onim sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Eat it as it is.	Di no sɛnea ɛte.
I touch his hand	Mede me nsa ka ne nsa
He had no interest in anything else.	Ná onni biribi foforo biara ho anigye.
He knew something that would.	Ná onim biribi a ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I could always use another handful	Ná metumi de nsa foforo adi dwuma bere nyinaa
I'm really looking forward to it.	Mehwɛ kwan ankasa.
This is a job.	Eyi yɛ adwuma.
At the same time, most .	Bere koro no ara mu no, dodow no ara .
I know it’s hard for him	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ den ma no
I have the same problem	Mewɔ ɔhaw koro no ara
It was a great moment.	Na ɛyɛ bere kɛse bi.
It’s never a bad thing.	Ɛnyɛ ade bɔne da.
I think it should be pretty soon	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ntɛm yiye
I couldn’t see what was going on	Na mintumi nhu nea ɛrekɔ so no
I didn’t want to see you	Na mempɛ sɛ mihu wo
I couldn’t believe him	Ná mintumi nnye no nni
Great city, very alive	Kurow kɛse, a ɛte ase yiye
Just.	Kɛkɛ.
I did think it was wonderful.	Misusuwii ampa sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I couldn’t make you happy	Na mintumi mma w’ani nnye
It’s a great game.	Ɛyɛ agoru kɛse bi.
I was still there.	Ná meda so ara wɔ hɔ.
I may be missing items or have outdated information.	Ebia nneɛma bi nni me ho anaasɛ mewɔ nsɛm a ne bere atwam.
We could have done better this time	Anka yebetumi ayɛ yiye saa bere yi
Work available if you can find it.	Adwuma a ɛwɔ hɔ sɛ wubetumi ahu a.
I shouldn’t know this	Ɛnsɛ sɛ mihu eyi
Everyone in the background was also gone.	Ná obiara a ɔwɔ akyi no nso nni hɔ bio.
Maybe he’ll get better.	Ebia ne ho bɛtɔ no.
I have to be careful with the legs now	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye wɔ nan no ho mprempren
I’ve always been interested	M’ani gye ho bere nyinaa
You can see the house.	Wubetumi ahu ofie no.
I can’t imagine it now	Mintumi nsusuw ho mprempren
I gave one to each of them	Mede biako maa wɔn mu biara
Great story, right?.	Asɛm kɛse, ɛnte saa?.
Obviously, that is also true.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛno nso yɛ nokware.
I couldn’t let him	Na mintumi mma no kwan
However, it is not necessary.	Nanso, ɛho nhia.
That’s a good thing in many cases.	Ɛno yɛ ade pa wɔ nsɛm pii mu.
He will be there too.	Ɔno nso bɛba hɔ.
I had no idea how long he would go on	Ná minnim bere tenten a ɔbɛkɔ so ayɛ saa
I think they should be involved as well.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu nso.
It was terrible.	Ná ɛyɛ hu.
Tell me how it is for you.	Ka sɛnea ɛte ma wo kyerɛ me.
I'm telling it.	Meka no hwɛ.
In the end, though, he just nodded.	Nanso, awiei koraa no, ɔde ne ti too fam kɛkɛ.
It all makes me happy.	Ne nyinaa ma m’ani gye.
He doesn’t know anything else.	Onnim biribi foforo biara.
His speech had come at a price, his life.	Ná ne kasa no aba wɔ bo bi mu, ne nkwa.
I think he is our only hope	Misusuw sɛ ɔno nkutoo ne yɛn anidaso
So you know what’s in the water.	Enti wunim nea ɛwɔ nsu no mu.
But where a man comes from never meant much to me.	Nanso baabi a ɔbarima fi no ankyerɛ pii mma me da.
All animals are in danger.	Mmoa nyinaa wɔ asiane mu.
That shut him down a bit.	Ɛno maa no too mu kakra.
She seemed really warm and happy that day.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ hyew ankasa na n’ani agye saa da no.
Take a mortgage arrangement.	Fa dan ka ho nhyehyɛe.
First, some background.	Nea edi kan no, nsɛm bi a ɛwɔ akyi.
I can’t do this to them	Mintumi nyɛ wɔn eyi
I believe really strongly	Migye di denneennen ankasa
No one could find any of them.	Obiara antumi anhu wɔn mu biara.
He’s a kid, after all.	Ɔyɛ abofra, ne nyinaa akyi no.
We just can’t do anything about that.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ ho biribi kɛkɛ wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
Maybe a little later, but not just yet.	Ebia akyiri yi kakra, nanso ɛnyɛ mprempren ara.
I want to hear the whole story	Mepɛ sɛ mete asɛm no nyinaa
I can’t go out and walk in the park	Mintumi mfi adi nkɔ nantew abɔnten so
I was a model for him.	Ná meyɛ obi a ɔyɛ mfonini ma no.
I can't 'believe this.	Mintumi 'nnye eyi nni.
So one of two things.	Enti nneɛma abien ho biako.
He had been transferred.	Ná wɔde ne ho akɔ baabi foforo.
You’re a lot like me.	Wo te sɛ me pii.
It’s really nice to be able to help.	Ɛyɛ anigye ampa sɛ wubetumi aboa.
Put us on top of everyone else.	Fa yɛn to obiara so.
So for years and years.	Enti mfe ne mfe pii.
He works on it.	Ɔyɛ ho adwuma.
I heard you were in town	Metee sɛ wowɔ kurow no mu
What it is.	Nea ɛyɛ.
I don’t know you at all.	Minnim wo koraa.
He has money.	Ɔwɔ sika.
It still shows the old value.	Ɛda so ara kyerɛ bo dedaw no.
I need to say something soon	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribi ntɛm
Most people can’t do that.	Nnipa dodow no ara ntumi nyɛ saa.
I couldn’t prove this.	Na mintumi nkyerɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nokware.
These things don’t matter to me	Saa nneɛma yi ho nhia me
I want to see him again	Mepɛ sɛ mihu no bio
Over time, it gets bigger.	Bere kɔ so no, ɛyɛ kɛse.
I had no idea who touched whom	Ná minnim onii a ɔde ne nsa ka hena
No one is perfect.	Obiara nni hɔ a odi mũ.
Very good, but still not human.	Ɛyɛ papa yiye, nanso ɛda so ara nyɛ onipa.
You might do that.	Ebia wobɛyɛ saa.
A strong, wonderful man	Onipa a ɔyɛ den, ɔyɛ nwonwa
And it sounds weird, you know.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa, wunim.
I couldn’t see the people	Na mintumi nhu nnipa no
He worked a lot, he did a lot.	Ɔyɛɛ adwuma pii, ɔyɛɛ pii.
Look at the timing of the game.	Hwɛ bere a wɔde di agoru no.
I put my trust in him	Mede me ho too ne ho so
I put them aside for good, at least for today	Mede wɔn to nkyɛn ma papa, anyɛ yiye koraa no nnɛ
I have absolutely no preferences	Minni biribiara a mepɛ koraa
They are so exciting and fresh.	Wɔyɛ anigye kɛse na wɔyɛ foforo.
He didn't know much.	Ná onnim nneɛma pii.
That’s how it was, anyway.	Saa na na ɛte, sɛnea ɛte biara.
I couldn't see very well.	Ná mintumi nhu ade yiye koraa.
I really think it was the best.	Misusuw ankasa sɛ na eye sen biara.
I can go from that to the other	Metumi afi saa tebea no mu akɔ foforo no mu
Or tomorrow morning.	Anaasɛ ɔkyena anɔpa.
It was pretty cool though.	Na ɛyɛ fɛ yiye nanso.
He was the only person who could have it.	Ɔno nkutoo ne onipa a na obetumi anya bi.
I was never very fond of him	Ná m’ani nnye ne ho kɛse da
He knew it was wonderful.	Ná onim sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
People are afraid.	Nkurɔfo suro.
I wasn’t thinking clearly at the time	Saa bere no na minsusuw nneɛma ho yiye
You can’t touch me, you’re not human enough.	Worentumi mfa wo nsa nka me, wonyɛ onipa a ɛdɔɔso.
That’s the beauty of the whole thing.	Ɛno ne ade no nyinaa fɛ.
I thought we could see maybe	Misusuwii sɛ yebetumi ahu ebia
But the truth doesn’t help him.	Nanso nokware no mmoa no.
Surely you can do it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wubetumi ayɛ.
I feel terrible for him	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ hu ma no
I like this length a lot.	M’ani gye saa tenten yi ho kɛse.
I almost didn’t like them anymore	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na m’ani nnye wɔn ho bio
He can be the man.	Obetumi ayɛ ɔbarima no.
My wife told me not to.	Me yere ka kyerɛɛ me sɛ menyɛ saa.
I looked at him beside me	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ no ​​wɔ me nkyɛn
This takes some practice.	Eyi gye sɛ wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu kakra.
I wouldn’t want to drive.	Anka mempɛ sɛ mɛka kar no.
My favorite time of the year.	Bere a m’ani gye ho paa wɔ afe no mu.
So many children.	Enti mmofra pii.
It’s not perfect, but it’s amazing.	Ɛnyɛ pɛ, nanso ɛyɛ nwonwa.
That may have been true at one time, but not anymore.	Ebia na ɛno yɛ nokware bere bi, nanso ɛnte saa bio.
The best part of the day.	Da no fã a eye sen biara.
It seems to be easy.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Just like us.	Te sɛ yɛn ara.
We can both agree on that.	Yɛn baanu nyinaa betumi ayɛ adwene wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I thought you would be good	Misusuwii sɛ wobɛyɛ papa
Discuss something with yourself.	Wo ne wo nsusuw biribi ho.
Something bad is happening.	Biribi bɔne biara rekɔ so.
I know exactly what he will say.	Minim nea ɔbɛka no yiye.
I can’t keep going back and forth	Mintumi nkɔ so nkɔ anim ne akyi
There are some things that are better.	Nneɛma bi wɔ hɔ a eye sen biara.
It’s what it is.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ.
Or the same interest seems to come back over time.	Anaasɛ ɛte sɛ nea anigye koro no ara san ba bio bere a bere kɔ so no.
I never knew how similar we were	Na minnim sɛnea yɛn ho yɛ pɛ da
A little goes a long way here	Kakraa bi kɔ akyiri wɔ ha
It was like he was.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔyɛ no.
Maybe even people you know.	Ebia nnipa a wunim wɔn mpo.
I wasn't sure why he was doing that	Ná minnim nea enti a ɔreyɛ saa no yiye
But not everyone could go down.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ obiara na obetumi akɔ fam.
At a certain price.	Wɔ bo bi so.
His son, but also my son.	Ne ba, nanso me ba nso.
Everyone saw what happened	Obiara huu nea esii no
I'm just a little bit.	Meyɛ kakra bi kɛkɛ.
I was also absolutely terrible	Ná me nso me ho yɛ hu koraa
But there are other reasons.	Nanso nneɛma foforo nso wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
I am in charge of it now.	Me na mehwɛ so mprempren.
Lots and lots of food.	Aduan pii ne pii.
As it has been.	Sɛnea ayɛ no.
I seemed to be doing this a lot.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea mereyɛ eyi pii.
However, it should be only a small amount.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ dodow kakraa bi pɛ.
I should have thought about that	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw saa asɛm no ho
He acted against me.	Ɔyɛɛ ade tiaa me.
She is also a beautiful girl.	Ɔno nso yɛ abeawa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I was there, but my mind was not there	Ná mewɔ hɔ, nanso na m’adwene nni hɔ
Or the road.	Anaasɛ ɔkwan no.
It just gets bigger every week.	Ɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa dapɛn biara.
It would have been.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
I wonder what he will do about it.	Misusuw nea ɔbɛyɛ wɔ ho.
He likes them though.	Ɔpɛ wɔn de, nanso.
I have to do something	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi
However, there was no one.	Nanso, na obiara nni hɔ.
I felt like a completely different person after those words	Metee nka sɛ meyɛ obi foforo koraa wɔ saa nsɛm no akyi
He got used to it immediately.	Ɔyɛɛ ne su ntɛm ara.
He told her that it was his opinion.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛyɛ n’adwene.
I don’t think that’s such a big deal.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse saa.
Not that long ago.	Ɛnyɛ bere tenten ni saa.
It was .	Ná ɛyɛ .
And it works.	Na ɛyɛ adwuma.
I know you are familiar with that concept	Minim sɛ wunim saa adwene no yiye
I couldn’t believe we were actually in it	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛ yɛwɔ mu ankasa
I think you can do a lot more good	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi ayɛ nneɛma pa pii bio
Nothing that important, you know.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛho hia saa, wunim.
I walk through it with my feet.	Mede me nan fa mu.
If he understands.	Sɛ ɔte ase a.
I think it was on the doorstep of his house	Misusuw sɛ na ɛwɔ ne fie pon ano
I didn't mean to be personal	Ná ɛnyɛ sɛ mepɛ sɛ meyɛ obi ankasa ho nsɛm
Both are extremely difficult.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ den kɛse.
The kids needed him now.	Ná mmofra no hia no mprempren.
His best years were his first three years	Ne mfe a eye sen biara ne ne mfe abiɛsa a edi kan
I felt like I was happy.	Metee nka sɛ m’ani agye.
They all have one thing in common.	Wɔn nyinaa wɔ ade biako a ɛyɛ pɛ.
I love the simplicity of it	M’ani gye sɛnea ɛyɛ mmerɛw no ho
I expected the same here.	Ná mehwɛ kwan sɛ saa ara na ɛte wɔ ha.
But that would take time.	Nanso na ɛno begye bere.
Now we are on the bed.	Seesei yɛwɔ mpa no so.
I can be very, very good with my friends	Metumi ayɛ me nnamfo pa kɛse, yiye
I keep going with it	Mekɔ so ne no kɔ
I definitely like the idea of ​​this, conceptually.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ m’ani gye eyi ho adwene no ho, wɔ adwene mu.
I wanted your shoes.	Ná mepɛ wo mpaboa.
I have something wonderful to tell you	Mewɔ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa a mɛka akyerɛ wo
A child is a child.	Abofra yɛ abofra.
Part of his mind still knew where it was	Ná n’adwene fã bi da so ara nim baabi a ɛwɔ
And even then, barely.	Na saa bere no mpo, ɛkame ayɛ sɛ.
But apparently it works for him	Nanso ɛda adi sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma ma no
That’s fine, not very smart.	Ɛno yɛ yiye, ɛnyɛ nyansa kɛse.
This is not about one big sin this year.	Eyi nyɛ bɔne kɛse biako ho asɛm afe yi.
I know where he is	Minim baabi a ɔwɔ
I had it right here	Ná mewɔ no wɔ ha yi ara
This is a realistic one.	Eyi yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
Which I can only hope that is true	Nea metumi anya anidaso sɛ ɛno yɛ nokware
I think it’s pretty amazing	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye
The occupant was gone, for now.	Ná nea ɔte mu no nni hɔ bio, mprempren de.
It was a great learning experience.	Ná ɛyɛ adesua kɛse bi.
There are few opportunities.	Hokwan kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
This may be a little painful.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ yaw kakra.
Things might be better now.	Ebia na nneɛma bɛyɛ yiye mprempren.
No one could see it.	Obiara antumi anhu.
I have something.	Mewɔ biribi.
Thank you everyone.	Meda mo ase obiara.
You have a good point.	Wowɔ asɛm pa bi.
I thought he must have been involved	Misusuwii sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔno na ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu
I didn’t care if he was home or not	Sɛ́ ɔwɔ fie anaasɛ onni fie no, na ɛnyɛ me asɛm
I guess he is not home	Misusuw sɛ ɔnyɛ fie
It had happened again.	Ná asi bio.
There was absolutely no way.	Ná ɔkwan biara nni hɔ koraa.
Usually, the handlebars are used.	Mpɛn pii no, wɔde nsa a ɛwɔ akyi no na edi dwuma.
As far as he knew, he never did.	Sɛnea na onim no, na ɔnyɛ saa da.
And somehow another year has come to an end.	Na ɔkwan bi so no, afe foforo aba awiei.
I didn’t care anymore	Ná ɛnyɛ me asɛm bio
I didn’t need to say those words.	Ná enhia sɛ meka saa nsɛm no.
But you’re not the same person you used to be.	Nanso wonyɛ onipa koro no ara a na woyɛ no.
We use it for everything, all the time.	Yɛde di dwuma ma biribiara, bere nyinaa.
Take a moment to think about this.	Fa bere tiaa bi susuw eyi ho.
I have nothing to do with them.	Me ne wɔn nni hwee yɛ.
I want to think this through	Mepɛ sɛ misusuw eyi ho yiye
I know you want this.	Minim sɛ wopɛ eyi.
I wanted someone to play with	Ná mepɛ obi a me ne no bedi agoru
Again, look at the characters.	Bio nso, hwɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ saa no.
But they didn’t have to.	Nanso na ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
A huge mistake.	Mfomso kɛse bi.
Walking was impossible.	Ná nantew ntumi nyɛ yiye.
That is our power.	Ɛno ne yɛn tumi.
I just can't deal with that yet	Mintumi nni saa asɛm no ho dwuma kɛkɛ de besi nnɛ
Only use it if you know what you are doing.	Sɛ wunim nea woreyɛ nkutoo a, fa di dwuma.
I knew it was going into this	Na minim sɛ ɛrekɔ eyi mu
They are not necessarily your fault.	Ɛnyɛ wo mfomso ankasa na wɔyɛ.
I have a business to take care of	Mewɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ so
It’s not much.	Ɛnyɛ pii.
I want to see how he is doing.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea ɔreyɛ yiye.
He touched one of them.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa biako.
Kids still need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mmofra da so ara hu.
I couldn’t enjoy it	Ná mintumi nnya mu anigye
Maybe more.	Ebia pii.
No doubt you have a favorite child.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wowɔ abofra a w’ani gye ne ho.
Other than that, it looks great.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I walked her home around dinner time	Mede ne nan kɔɔ fie bɛyɛ anwummere aduan bere
How beautiful, how simple.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ fɛ, sɛnea ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Which brings me back to your first test.	Ɛno de me san ba wo sɔhwɛ a edi kan no mu.
I also love your music	M’ani gye wo nnwom nso ho
You are very strong and warm.	Wo ho yɛ den yiye na wo ho yɛ hyew.
All of those things were true.	Ná saa nneɛma no nyinaa yɛ nokware.
That’s the only thing he has to do.	Ɛno nkutoo ne ade a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I think you should take me.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wode me kɔ.
I know where he will go.	Minim baabi a ɔbɛkɔ.
I was on him immediately	Ná mewɔ ne so ntɛm ara
But it never works.	Nanso ɛnyɛ adwuma da.
I have other things.	Mewɔ nneɛma foforo.
Will this work for you.	So eyi bɛyɛ adwuma ama wo.
I know what meetings can be like	Minim sɛnea nhyiam ahorow betumi ayɛ
That says a lot about my state of mind.	Ɛno ka nsɛm pii fa m’adwene tebea ho.
I had to pretend I liked the story	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ me ho sɛ mepɛ asɛm no
I hadn’t thought about that	Ná minsusuw saa asɛm no ho
Too much trial and error.	Sɔhwɛ ne mfomso pii dodo.
I know all about him	Minim ne ho nsɛm nyinaa
I think that’s the best	Misusuw sɛ ɛno na eye sen biara
I have to tell you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo.
As much as possible, we will be comfortable.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye biara no, yɛn ho bɛtɔ yɛn.
After a moment, he dropped the letter.	Bere tiaa bi akyi no, ɔde krataa no too hɔ.
That’s the book.	Ɛno ne nhoma no.
I knew what he was doing.	Ná minim nea ɔreyɛ.
I couldn’t think of anything to say	Na mintumi nsusuw asɛm biara a mɛka ho
I believe that problems are opportunities	Migye di sɛ ɔhaw ahorow yɛ hokwan ahorow
I can give it to you.	Metumi de ama wo.
I don’t like it now.	M’ani nnye ho mprempren.
This was a good one.	Ná eyi yɛ papa.
This was much bigger, and he didn't like it.	Ná eyi yɛ kɛse sen saa koraa, na na n’ani nnye ho.
But don’t let anyone tell you it’s going to be easy.	Nanso mma obiara nka nkyerɛ wo sɛ ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
He glared at me for a moment.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ me so bere tiaa bi.
He knows his team.	Onim ne kuw no.
That was the way it was for him.	Saa na na ɛte ma no.
We hope you enjoyed the stay as much as we did.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani gyee tra no ho te sɛ yɛn.
I took the opportunity	Mede hokwan no dii dwuma
There is no such thing.	Asɛm a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ.
They are very beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
The way they do it.	Sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
That same evening.	Saa anwummere no ara.
This room is bigger than that.	Saa dan yi yɛ kɛse sen saa.
One of the best in the business.	Nea eye sen biara wɔ adwuma no mu no mu biako.
There seemed to be a new situation.	Na ɛte sɛ nea tebea foforo bi wɔ hɔ.
I know everyone here	Minim obiara a ɔwɔ ha
Now everything is starting to normalize.	Seesei biribiara afi ase reyɛ sɛnea ɛte no ara.
My thoughts go out to you.	M’adwene kɔ wo nkyɛn.
It wasn’t like I was a mom	Ná ɛnyɛ sɛ meyɛ maame
And who might it be.	Na hena na ebia ɛyɛ.
I had access to everything	Ná mewɔ biribiara ho kwan
But those two were one.	Nanso na saa baanu no yɛ biako.
It’s like a song.	Ɛte sɛ dwom.
He follows what he wants.	Odi nea ɔpɛ akyi.
It will be possible.	Ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
One is wisdom.	Biako ne nyansa.
I find this disturbing and unpleasant	Mihu sɛ eyi haw adwene na ɛnyɛ anigye
And to them, something like a.	Na wɔn nkyɛn no, biribi te sɛ a.
Anyone can see what is happening, as it was happening.	Obiara betumi ahu nea ɛrekɔ so, sɛnea na ɛrekɔ so no.
I didn’t even know the man	Ná minnim ɔbarima no mpo
It has a little bit of both, when it’s neither.	Ɛwɔ kakra sɛ abien no nyinaa, bere a ɛnyɛ biara.
I think they might have been a pair	Misusuw sɛ ebia na wɔyɛ baanu baanu
To my eyes, the city was beautiful.	Wɔ m’ani so no, na kurow no yɛ fɛ.
I think your group is powerless	Misusuw sɛ mo kuw no nni tumi
It was a fun ride.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye a wɔde tra kar mu.
My mother wanted her son to be owed everything.	Ná me maame pɛ sɛ wɔde ne ba no ka biara.
He had a job to do.	Ná ɔwɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
Do it at home.	Yɛ wɔ fie.
I see that for what it is	Mihu saa wɔ nea ɛte no ho
There is nothing to see here.	Biribiara nni hɔ a wubetumi ahu wɔ ha.
I still didn’t know anything	Ná meda so ara nnim hwee
Your information matters.	Wo nsɛm ho hia.
I will bring you another one.	Mede foforo bɛba wo.
In my eyes.	Wɔ m’ani so.
Think about that, and tell that to a child.	Susuw saa asɛm no ho, na wobɛka saa akyerɛ abofra bi.
But this is my son.	Nanso eyi ne me ba.
I think she is beautiful	Misusuw sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ
Really bad timing.	Bere bɔne ankasa.
I like to work with money	M’ani gye ho sɛ mede sika bɛyɛ adwuma
I think we need to do something about it	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho biribi
The situation was strange.	Ná tebea no yɛ nwonwa.
I knew a lot of people	Ná minim nnipa pii
I want to be happy for them	Mepɛ sɛ m’ani gye ma wɔn
And you can use them to build many things.	Na wubetumi de wɔn asi nneɛma pii.
I have three of them.	Mewɔ abiɛsa.
I really liked the song	M’ani gyee dwom no ho kɛse
No one is home anymore.	Obiara nni fie bio.
But there is nothing else here.	Nanso biribi foforo biara nni ha.
I looked down, wanting to touch him	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ fam, a na mepɛ sɛ mede me nsa ka no
His mother must have been right.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ne maame asɛm no yɛ nokware.
I will definitely do that.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mɛyɛ saa.
What a great song.	Dwom kɛse bɛn ara ni.
However, there is still much to be done.	Nanso, nneɛma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
And many children.	Ne mma pii.
I think he can help me	Misusuw sɛ obetumi aboa me
Talk about everything you do and talk about what your child is doing.	Ka biribiara a woyɛ ho asɛm na ka nea wo ba no reyɛ ho asɛm.
I don’t know anymore.	Minnim bio.
Your home could handle more.	Ná wo fie betumi adi pii ho dwuma.
I felt it completely in the present moment	Metee nka koraa wɔ mprempren bere yi mu
One week has come and gone.	Dapɛn biako aba na akɔ.
This is a system-wide problem	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw a ɛwɔ nhyehyɛe no nyinaa mu
A very old man.	Ɔbarima a ne mfe akɔ anim koraa.
He was the other way around.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔkwan foforo no so.
I don’t know why that is.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
I don’t know if that’s possible	Minnim sɛ ebia ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye anaa
I have no idea why it’s there	Me nni adwene biara wɔ nea enti a ɛwɔ hɔ
That’s not the same as saying it.	Ɛno ne sɛ wobɛka no nyɛ ade koro.
I was pretty full on those days	Ná me ho ayɛ me ma yiye wɔ saa nna no mu
However, that wasn’t true.	Nanso, na ɛno nyɛ nokware.
Just one night here.	Anadwo biako pɛ wɔ ha.
But this is true.	Nanso eyi yɛ nokware.
And if something goes wrong, there are support parties.	Na sɛ biribi ankɔ yiye a, mmoa apontow ahorow wɔ hɔ.
I just wanted to see you	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu wo ara kwa
Maybe for money.	Ebia sika nti.
But we need to do at least one game a year.	Nanso anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ agoru biako afe biara.
Something else is needed.	Biribi foforo ho hia.
I knew only one of us could go	Ná minim sɛ yɛn mu biako pɛ na obetumi akɔ
Not in any way at all.	Ɛnyɛ ɔkwan biara so koraa.
I think this happened to me two years ago	Misusuw sɛ eyi too me mfe abien a atwam ni
I can’t do this, not like this	Mintumi nyɛ eyi, ɛnyɛ sɛ eyi
It was the boy.	Ná ɛyɛ abarimaa no.
And he did a very good job for her.	Na ɔyɛɛ no ​​adwuma bi yiye koraa.
I am in charge of everything	Me na mehwɛ biribiara so
Reveal new information.	Da nsɛm foforo adi.
I almost fainted at his touch	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ me ho yɛɛ me hyew bere a mede me nsa kaa me no
I thought that was a great story.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm kɛse.
It’s terrifying to this day.	Ɛyɛ hu de besi nnɛ.
I can do that at home	Metumi ayɛ saa wɔ fie
I can take you somewhere until this is all over	Metumi de wo akɔ baabi kosi sɛ eyi nyinaa bɛba awiei
I wish it wasn’t true, but it is	Me yam a anka ɛnyɛ nokware, nanso ɛte saa
That does happen.	Ɛno ba ampa.
I didn't know how long	Ná minnim bere tenten a mede bɛyɛ saa
That number has no order.	Saa dodow no nni nhyehyɛe.
I couldn’t have heard the same.	Anka mintumi nte saa ara.
I hoped you would like the view	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ no ho
This is like another movie	Eyi te sɛ sini foforo
So it’s a new book.	Enti ɛyɛ nhoma foforo.
I knew him all my life	Ná minim no me nkwa nna nyinaa
He had no rights to anyone.	Ná onni hokwan biara wɔ obiara ho.
I step through the door	Mede me nan fa ɔpon no ano
And simple, this will be an amazing shot.	Na ɛyɛ mmerɛw, eyi bɛyɛ tuo a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I should never have done that	Ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa da
I was popular that morning	Ná nkurɔfo ani gye me ho saa anɔpa no
I didn’t want you to know.	Na mempɛ sɛ wuhu.
The item should refer to something that the children are good at.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ade no kyerɛ biribi a mmofra no ho akokwaw wɔ mu.
That’s what he wants to do.	Ɛno ne nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
You owe me that.	Wode me ka saa.
Now they are part of the population.	Seesei wɔyɛ nnipa no fã.
I was just young for being young	Ná meyɛ abofra ara kwa sɛ meyɛ abofra
I quickly made head first	Meyɛɛ ntɛm yɛɛ ti kan
It is the work of two people.	Ɛyɛ nnipa baanu adwuma.
I am very worried about him.	Ne ho asɛm haw me paa.
The girl's father knew nothing about it.	Ná abeawa no papa nnim ho hwee.
I do everything intensely	Meyɛ biribiara denneennen
I had to act quickly	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ade ntɛmntɛm
That’s a pretty good thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade pa ara.
He didn’t want to hurt me.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ me yaw.
However, it wasn’t.	Nanso, na ɛnte saa.
I admire the man.	M’ani gye ɔbarima no ho.
Superior.	Di so.
Seems like a really good plan.	Ɛte sɛ nea nhyehyɛe pa ankasa.
I saw a lot of things	Mihuu nneɛma pii
We have a wealth of information and resources available to you.	Yɛwɔ nsɛm ne nneɛma pii a ɛwɔ hɔ ma wo.
However, I didn’t know.	Nanso, na minnim.
It’s all true.	Ne nyinaa yɛ nokware.
I know what’s beautiful	Minim nea ɛyɛ fɛ no
It has to be for me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ma me.
I want whatever you want	Mepɛ nea wopɛ biara
Make things better.	Ma nneɛma nyɛ papa.
My mind was clear and empty.	Ná m’adwene mu da hɔ na na hwee nni mu.
This is all new music.	Eyi nyinaa yɛ nnwom foforo.
For a moment, it didn’t seem to work.	Bere tiaa bi mu no, na ɛte sɛ nea anyɛ adwuma.
I wanted somewhere to go	Ná mepɛ baabi a mɛkɔ
Only you can decide that.	Wo nkutoo na wubetumi asi saa ho gyinae.
Think about them.	Fa wɔn ho susuw ho.
I hoped someone might be there.	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ ebia obi wɔ hɔ.
I just want you to be happy and whole again	Mepɛ sɛ w’ani gye na woayɛ pɛ bio kɛkɛ
Maybe there is nothing in it.	Ebia biribiara nni mu.
Many things can happen during that time	Nneɛma pii betumi asi wɔ saa bere no mu
He wanted to put her aside.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde no to nkyɛn.
One part of that was missing.	Ná ɛno fã biako nni hɔ.
I can’t understand it.	Mintumi nte ase.
A plan needs to be developed.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
Consider who else is involved.	Susuw onii foforo a ɔde ne ho hyɛ mu no ho hwɛ.
I don’t like that.	M’ani nnye ho saa.
He knew himself well.	Ná onim ne ho yiye.
Please don't use that.	Mesrɛ wo, mfa saa asɛm no nni dwuma.
It’s just been a terrible long week.	Ɛyɛ dapɛn tenten a ɛyɛ hu ara kwa.
He wanted to bring in people like me.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde nnipa te sɛ me ba.
I didn’t want to move on	Ná mempɛ sɛ mekɔ anim
His plan went only so far.	Ne nhyehyɛe no kɔɔ akyiri yi nkutoo.
That makes me very happy.	Ɛno ma m’ani gye paa.
This was not difficult.	Ná eyi nyɛ den.
That’s the only reason I have it.	Ɛno nkutoo ne nea enti a mewɔ.
There are also dangers.	Asiane nso wɔ hɔ.
It’s too much of a good thing.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma pa pii dodo.
I didn’t know what to do.	Ná minnim nea menyɛ.
I will tell him that too	Me nso mɛka saa akyerɛ no
But look at today.	Nanso hwɛ nnɛ.
I wasn’t good with this guy	Na me ne saa ɔbarima yi nyɛ papa
I hand over mine and head to lunch	Mede me de no ma na mede m’ani kyerɛ awia aduan
I was a lucky man, a very lucky man	Ná meyɛ ɔbarima a mewɔ anigye, ɔbarima a mewɔ anigye kɛse
I have already spent a lot of time working on it.	Mede bere pii ayɛ ho adwuma dedaw.
I wanted to know more	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu pii
A sense of power and authority came over him	Tumi ne tumi kɛse ho adwene baa ne so
That seems clear.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno mu da hɔ.
I’d love to go with you	M’ani begye ho sɛ me ne wo bɛkɔ
Get rid of it.	Yi no fi hɔ.
At least not this way.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ saa kwan yi so.
Save time and trouble.	Gye bere ne ɔhaw ahorow so.
I’m glad you like it	M’ani agye sɛ w’ani gye ho
But the problem is that it is not.	Nanso ɔhaw no ne sɛ ɛnte saa.
More features will be added as time goes on.	Wɔde nneɛma pii bɛka ho bere a bere kɔ so no.
I didn't think anyone would believe me anyway	Na minsusuw sɛ ɔkwan biara so no, obiara begye me adi
I look forward to everything but summer.	Mehwɛ biribiara kwan gye awɔw bere.
Many things.	Nneɛma pii.
Unless it is necessary.	Gye sɛ ɛho hia.
I loved the overall look.	M’ani gyee sɛnea ɛte no nyinaa ho.
Just as long as you have.	Bere tenten a wowɔ ara kwa.
It really hurts to say that.	Ɛyɛ yaw ankasa sɛ wobɛka saa.
Get out of town for a bit.	Fi kurow no mu kɔ kakra.
I think my timing was poor	Misusuw sɛ na bere a mede yɛɛ adwuma no nyɛ papa
The lunch was perfect.	Ná awia aduan no yɛ nea edi mũ.
It’s not a good idea.	Ɛnyɛ adwene pa.
He is here.	Ɔwɔ ha.
Give it to them.	Fa ma wɔn.
I didn’t know anyone else was here	Na minnim sɛ obi foforo biara wɔ ha
I think there is a letter on him	Misusuw sɛ krataa bi wɔ ne so
I wanted something to work	Ná mepɛ sɛ biribi yɛ adwuma
I think this year we might	Misusuw sɛ afe yi ebia yebetumi
However, this article does not provide that.	Nanso, asɛm yi mfa saa asɛm no mma.
There was something else.	Na biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
That is a simple matter.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
All these things will be good.	Saa nneɛma yi nyinaa bɛyɛ papa.
I knew his father.	Ná minim ne papa.
That’s for good in a way.	Ɛno yɛ ma papa wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
Remember, he doesn't know much about it.	Kae sɛ onnim ho nsɛm pii.
There are many varieties.	Ahorow pii wɔ hɔ.
I couldn’t find any work anywhere else	Ná mintumi nnya adwuma biara wɔ baabi foforo biara
And happiness worked.	Na anigye yɛɛ adwuma.
It’s not like that anymore.	Ɛnyɛ saa bio.
I can take that risk there	Metumi de saa asiane no akɔ hɔ
I want to do that for you	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa ma wo
A car in a garage.	Kar a ɛwɔ kar dan mu.
I’m in love with him	M’ani gyee ne ho
I want to go alone	Mepɛ sɛ me nkutoo kɔ
We cannot do one without the other.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ biako a biako no nka ho.
I didn’t know what to do with it	Ná minnim nea mede bɛyɛ
It was a very painful experience.	Ná ɛyɛ me yaw paa.
Someone has to make an effort.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi bɔ mmɔden.
He was looking bad.	Ná ne ho yɛ bɔne.
I couldn’t sleep at all	Ná mintumi nna biara
I just wanted to get to know him better	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu no yiye ara kwa
Man, what a beautiful idea that is.	Onipa, hwɛ sɛnea ɛno yɛ adwene a ɛyɛ fɛ.
But help never came.	Nanso mmoa amma da.
She looked so beautiful.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
Don’t be afraid of it.	Mma w’ani nnye ho.
I want to be there.	Mepɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ.
No problems so far.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ de besi nnɛ.
Say nothing for a week.	Nka hwee dapɛn biako.
I didn’t really have one	Ná minni bi ankasa
That’s too fast.	Ɛno yɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo.
There are many applications.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a wɔde di dwuma.
One point is about learning.	Asɛm biako fa adesua ho.
I have to keep getting back to myself	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so san kɔ me ho
There was no one else.	Ná obi foforo biara nni hɔ.
I didn’t want money	Ná mempɛ sika
I see a lot of good things.	Mihu nneɛma pa pii.
I forgot he was even here	Me werɛ fii sɛ ɔwɔ ha mpo
I lie next to him.	Meda ne nkyɛn.
I think he should come with me	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne me ba
It’s a highly charged season.	Ɛyɛ bere a wɔde nsu ahyɛ mu ma kɛse.
I couldn’t go on like that	Na mintumi nkɔ so nkɔ so saa
I know how things are.	Minim sɛnea nneɛma te.
I just couldn’t believe it.	Ná mintumi nnye nni kɛkɛ.
My impression was that this was another trend	Na m’adwene ne sɛ na eyi yɛ ade foforo a ɛrekɔ so
Let the best team win.	Ma kuw a eye sen biara no nni nkonim.
I thought it was the latter	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ nea etwa to no
Maybe there is nothing.	Ebia biribiara nni hɔ.
I have no control over that part of me	Minni saa me fã no so tumi biara
We should not include him in this work.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ yɛde no ka adwuma yi ho.
People hear the song all the time	Nkurɔfo te dwom no bere nyinaa
I could have decided otherwise.	Anka metumi asi gyinae sɛ ɛnte saa.
I want you to tell him	Mepɛ sɛ woka kyerɛ no
I knew what you meant	Ná minim nea wopɛ sɛ woka
At the time I didn’t know why.	Saa bere no na minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Some days it was a lot of work	Nna bi wɔ hɔ a na ɛyɛ adwuma kɛse
I couldn’t tell you what it was like	Na mintumi nka sɛnea ɛte no nkyerɛ wo
I didn’t know he would	Ná minnim sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa
I had no say in the matter	Ná minni asɛm biara ka wɔ asɛm no ho
I have to look into it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu.
I can’t sleep	Mintumi nna
Current data suggest otherwise.	Mprempren nsɛm a ɛwɔ hɔ no kyerɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
It was a thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade.
See what you think.	Hwɛ nea wususuw.
I really appreciate your good works	M’ani gye mo nnwuma pa ho yiye
However, I can’t help myself	Nanso, mintumi mmoa me ho
I love this city.	M’ani gye kurow yi ho.
It’s not easy for me, you know.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw mma me, wunim.
I have a strong opinion on that.	Mewɔ adwene a ɛyɛ den wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
However, there was something behind the scenes.	Nanso, na biribi wɔ nsɛm no akyi.
I just have a few things to say	Mewɔ nsɛm kakraa bi a mɛka kɛkɛ
I hope this doesn’t dictate your thoughts tonight	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ eyi nkyerɛ wo adwene anadwo yi
But for a while, nothing can touch him.	Nanso bere tiaa bi mu no, biribiara ntumi nka no.
I wanted that scene to be disturbing	Ná mepɛ sɛ saa tebea no haw adwene
There was no reason to head home.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde wɔn ani kyerɛ fie.
I was only there to be with him	Ná mewɔ hɔ sɛ mɛka ne ho nkutoo
I usually don’t have sleep.	Mpɛn pii no, minni nna.
There are many of them.	Wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
Take your time.	Gye wo bere.
It’s a little difficult	Ɛyɛ den kakra
I just wanted to be in the movie	Ná mepɛ sɛ mewɔ sini no mu ara kwa
You have to tell me what happened.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka nea esii no kyerɛ me.
He wants someone to do something about it.	Ɔpɛ sɛ obi yɛ ho biribi.
I don't know how to move on from here nothing works.	Me nnim sɛnea mɛkɔ so afi ha biribiara nyɛ adwuma.
All this is neither here nor here.	Eyi nyinaa nni ha anaa ha.
I wanted to know all the details	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu nsɛm no nyinaa
So it was a wonderful moment.	Enti na ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Here are some of the reasons why.	Nneɛma a enti a ɛte saa no bi ni.
That’s how he is.	Saa na ɔte.
He would as soon as these people left.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ sɛ saa nkurɔfo yi kɔ ara pɛ a.
Unlike the city.	Ɛnte sɛ kurow no.
I did it just for the fun of it	Meyɛɛ saa sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a m’ani begye ho ara kwa
I know exactly where we are	Minim baabi a yɛwɔ no yiye
I can’t imagine who else it would be	Mintumi nsusuw onii bio a anka ɛbɛyɛ ho
Everyone is that tall.	Obiara tenten saa.
I can promise you this	Metumi ahyɛ wo bɔ sɛ eyi
Consider only the role of time.	Susuw dwuma a bere di nkutoo ho.
And so does my new dog.	Na saa ara na me kraman foforo no nso te.
I think a lot of people were unaware of this opportunity	Misusuw sɛ na nnipa pii nnim hokwan yi
We can do this.	Yebetumi ayɛ eyi.
My father meant much more.	Ná me papa kyerɛ pii sen saa.
I’m absolutely thrilled	M’ani agye ho koraa
He’s my father too you know.	Ɔyɛ me papa nso wunim.
So it’s hard to tell that.	Enti ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛka saa asɛm no.
I have high hopes for him	Mewɔ anidaso kɛse ma no
You can do a lot of good things.	Wubetumi ayɛ nneɛma pa pii.
I think we can do another job	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi ayɛ adwuma foforo
I don't even have my license.	Minni me tumi krataa mpo.
But that’s not fast enough.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ ntɛmntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ.
If you like it, you can even show it to your friends.	Sɛ w’ani gye ho a, wubetumi mpo akyerɛ wo nnamfo.
I have to keep trying!.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so bɔ mmɔden!.
It’s been a fun couple of hours!.	Ɛyɛ anigye nnɔnhwerew abien!.
See this article and this one.	Hwɛ asɛm yi ne eyi.
I know it wasn’t that hard for you	Minim sɛ na ɛnyɛ den mma wo saa
The infrastructure needs to be what the people want.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma a wɔde bɛyɛ adwuma no yɛ nea nkurɔfo no pɛ.
I still had that to look forward to	Ná meda so ara wɔ saa a ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ kwan
I thought about everything	Misusuw biribiara ho
I didn't do it for you	Ɛnyɛ me na meyɛɛ no ​​amma wo
Something really needs to be done, and fast.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi ankasa, na wɔyɛ no ntɛmntɛm.
The plan failed.	Nhyehyɛe no antumi anyɛ yiye.
I didn’t know he had any of that	Ná minnim sɛ ɔwɔ saa nneɛma no mu biara
I am a real person.	Meyɛ onipa ankasa.
He wanted to hear how he and their father approached the situation.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte sɛnea ɔne wɔn papa fa tebea no ho.
I hadn’t really thought about it.	Ná minsusuw ho ankasa.
Naturally, it had a plan to do so.	Sɛnea ɛte no, na ɛwɔ nhyehyɛe bi a wɔde bɛyɛ saa.
Let the girl be independent.	Ma abeawa no nyɛ nea ɔde ne ho.
Maybe he put a person on it.	Ebia ɔde onipa bi too so.
There was nothing else you could do.	Na biribi foforo biara nni hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ.
I was and still am very surprised by this	Eyi yɛɛ me nwonwa yiye na ɛda so ara yɛ me nwonwa
But you, you wanted to.	Nanso wo, na wopɛ.
I don’t like it here either	M’ani nnye ho wɔ ha nso
We drove on.	Yɛde kar no kɔɔ so.
I didn’t even know if it was a good thing	Ná minnim mpo sɛ ɛyɛ ade pa anaa
He wrapped his arms around me.	Ɔde ne nsa bɔɔ me mu.
You tell him one day.	Woka kyerɛ no da bi.
Look at every floor.	Hwɛ fam biara.
He's a little full of himself.	Ɔno ankasa ahyɛ no ma kakra.
It's just going from bad to worse now.	Ɛrekɔ bɔne mu akɔ bɔne mu ara kwa mprempren.
They were beautiful.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
The task was not too difficult.	Ná adwuma no nyɛ den dodo.
It must have been terrifying.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ hu.
I wanted to do the job.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma no.
His head was down.	Ná ne ti abɔ fam.
Better than the last one.	Ɛyɛ papa sen nea etwa to no.
I used it today for the first time.	Mede dii dwuma nnɛ nea edi kan.
He was there.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ.
I made up my mind a long time ago	Meyɛɛ m’adwene bere tenten a atwam ni
Keep it as hot as possible.	Ma ɛnyɛ hyew sɛnea wubetumi biara.
Many of them are still there.	Wɔn mu pii da so ara wɔ hɔ.
His room was empty.	Ná hwee nni ne dan mu.
But there is no such mobile home.	Nanso ofie a wɔde fa nnipa a ɛte saa biara nni hɔ.
That’s the real thing.	Ɛno ne no ankasa.
Tomorrow is another day.	Ɔkyena yɛ da foforo.
It is best to do it immediately.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ wobɛyɛ no ntɛm ara.
I saw the clothes.	Mihuu ntade no.
These details are important.	Saa nsɛm yi yɛ nea ɛho hia.
He must have been gone.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na onni hɔ bio.
You don’t have to know.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wuhu.
Beautiful normal girl	Abeawa a ɔte ase a ne ho yɛ fɛ
There was a time.	Bere bi na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I didn’t know what was possible	Ná minnim nea ɛyɛ yiye
I can’t see it.	Mintumi nhu.
Just give me a moment.	Ma me bere tiaa bi kɛkɛ.
I barely existed for this man	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na minni hɔ mma ɔbarima yi
This went on for many years.	Eyi kɔɔ so mfe pii.
I should have tasted it while lying down	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka hwɛ bere a meda fam no
They were the same age, the same height.	Ná wɔn mfe yɛ pɛ, na wɔn tenten yɛ pɛ.
I have to look at the floor	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ fam hɔ
I am working on another book	Mereyɛ nhoma foforo ho adwuma
It seemed like an interesting thing	Ná ɛte sɛ ade a ɛyɛ anigye
But that’s just the thing.	Nanso ɛno ara ne ade no.
I want his hands back	Mepɛ sɛ ne nsa san ba bio
I wanted to tell him it wasn’t true	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ no sɛ ɛnyɛ nokware
She looked at him hopefully.	Ɔde anidaso hwɛɛ no.
Obviously not recently.	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛnyɛ nnansa yi ara.
It’s almost a little ugly.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ kakra.
Instead of being.	Sɛ́ anka ɛbɛyɛ.
I tell you the girl is no good	Meka kyerɛ wo sɛ abeawa no nyɛ papa biara
I knew you wanted me to be good	Ná minim sɛ wopɛ sɛ meyɛ papa
I had to drive back	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede kar san fa hɔ
I question everything now	Migye biribiara ho kyim mprempren
He liked that too.	Ná n’ani gye saa nso ho.
I forgot my afternoon meeting	Me werɛ fii me awia nhyiam no
I am still sitting on my bed.	Meda so ara te me mpa so.
I would be one of those people.	Anka mɛyɛ saa nnipa no mu biako.
I'm sorry for putting you here.	Mepa wo kyɛw sɛ mede wo too ha.
If this is the case, remove the last statement.	Sɛ eyi te saa a, yi asɛm a etwa to no fi hɔ.
New knows what to do.	Ɔyɛ foforo nim nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
I could literally talk about school all day	Ná metumi aka sukuu ho asɛm da mũ nyinaa ankasa
One thing is certain, though.	Nanso, ade biako yɛ nokware.
It’s an old picture.	Ɛyɛ mfonini dedaw bi.
You certainly don’t sound like it.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wo nte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
Maybe so, maybe not.	Ebia ɛte saa, ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
And that’s what’s so scary.	Na ɛno ne nea ɛyɛ hu saa.
I just couldn’t seem to do anything about it.	Ɛte sɛ nea na mintumi nyɛ ho hwee kɛkɛ.
I have a lot to say about that book.	Mewɔ nsɛm pii ka fa saa nhoma no ho.
I always have to go down the same size.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ fam bere nyinaa a ne kɛse yɛ pɛ.
It had flaws.	Ná ɛwɔ mfomso ahorow.
It never exists.	Ɛwɔ hɔ da.
But he doesn’t.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa.
I had to tell them something	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribi kyerɛ wɔn
They were as good as their story.	Na wɔyɛ papa te sɛ wɔn asɛm no.
I wasn’t pretty.	Ná me ho nyɛ fɛ.
I pretended to be any other person	Meyɛɛ me ho sɛ onipa foforo biara
I can’t figure out how to do that.	Me ntumi nhu sɛnea mɛyɛ saa.
But you have more about that.	Nanso wowɔ saa asɛm no ho nsɛm pii.
They just are who they are, as you said.	Wɔyɛ wɔn a wɔyɛ ara kwa, sɛnea wokae no.
I actually owed one	Ná mede biako ka ankasa
This scene is really cold.	Saa tebea yi yɛ awɔw ankasa.
I wish you were going with me	Me yam a anka wo ne me rekɔ
They have to be real people.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ nnipa ankasa.
I go hard immediately	Mekɔ denneennen ntɛm ara
I knew that would be a lie	Ná minim sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ atoro
I had never forgotten	Ná me werɛ mfi da
He had the same thing.	Ná ɔwɔ saa ara.
They are rare but important.	Wɔn ho yɛ na nanso ɛho hia.
I need to know what’s going on	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so
Good and evil.	Papa ne bɔne.
I didn’t know what to tell them	Ná minnim nea mɛka akyerɛ wɔn
If it still is, no problem here.	Sɛ ɛda so ara te saa a, ɔhaw biara nni ha.
For the most part, the reason is the same.	Wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu no, nea enti a ɛte saa no yɛ ade koro.
That in itself has been great.	Ɛno ankasa ayɛ kɛse.
Like, take control of them.	Te sɛ, fa wɔn di so.
I know it’s not that easy.	Minim sɛ ɛnyɛ mmerɛw saa.
The boy is wearing a shirt and shorts.	Abarimaa no hyɛ atade ne atade tiaa.
I couldn’t control it	Ná mintumi nni so
I get involved a lot.	Mede me ho hyɛ mu pii.
I thought it always would be	Misusuwii sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa
The space inside was amazing.	Ná baabi a ɛwɔ mu no yɛ nwonwa.
You are here, it is there.	Wowɔ ha, ɛwɔ hɔ.
Clearly, this is not true.	Ɛda adi sɛ saa asɛm yi nyɛ nokware.
There was no one in my room.	Ná obiara nni me dan mu.
I'm working on it.	Mereyɛ ho adwuma.
I knew what it was like	Ná minim sɛnea ɛte
This makes people happy.	Eyi ma nnipa ani gye.
Great thing, today only	Ade kɛse, nnɛ nkutoo
He nodded his head.	Ɔde ne ti too fam.
I think he’ll be fine	Misusuw sɛ ɔbɛyɛ yiye
He just wanted you to think about them.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ wususuw wɔn ho ara kwa.
The issue wasn’t on me.	Ná asɛm no nni me so.
I have no idea where we are	Minni baabi a yɛwɔ ho adwene biara
Not for me, anyway.	Ɛnyɛ me de, ɔkwan biara so.
That’s always been a given.	Ɛno yɛ ade a wɔde ama bere nyinaa.
I can’t really talk about it	Mintumi nka ho asɛm ankasa
He is a little organized.	Ɔyɛ nhyehyɛe kakra.
This is not the situation.	Eyi nyɛ tebea no.
But it’s not outside at all.	Nanso ɛnyɛ abɔnten koraa.
This will be an interesting project.	Eyi bɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ anigye.
There was a grant involved.	Ná sika a wɔde ma wɔ mu.
So, even, they have their names.	Enti, mpo, wɔ wɔn din.
That it was over now.	Sɛ na aba awiei mprempren.
Even if that was a thing.	Sɛ na ɛno yɛ ade mpo a.
Keep up the good work.	Kɔ asɛm no so.
I understand where this all goes	Mete baabi a eyi nyinaa fa no ase
This was his last mistake.	Eyi ne ne mfomso a etwa to.
They are both going.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa rekɔ.
I have to tell him the real truth	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka nokware ankasa kyerɛ no
An innocent morning.	Anɔpa a ɛho nni asɛm.
You can make it look pretty good.	Wubetumi ama ayɛ fɛ yiye.
It was a month after it expired.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔsram biako akyi bere a na ne bere atwam no.
I see myself in him.	Mihu me ho wɔ ne mu.
I could hardly believe it	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nnye nni
The latter situation is the one.	Tebea a etwa to no ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ no.
Thrive! 	Kɔ so!
there is plenty to see if you wish.	pii wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ahu sɛ wopɛ a.
There is still so much to do, so much information to sort out.	Nneɛma pii da so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ, nsɛm pii a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
But he doesn’t do that anymore.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa bio.
You can add text much faster.	Wubetumi de nsɛm ahyɛ mu ntɛmntɛm kɛse.
The story you gave me.	Asɛm a wode maa me.
I don’t know why either	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa nso
So many people needed his help.	Enti na nnipa pii hia ne mmoa.
No one wants you here.	Obiara mpɛ wo wɔ ha.
I am a cyclist.	Meyɛ obi a ɔte sakre so.
He was there today.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ nnɛ.
I even wonder what that means	Misusuw nea ɛno kyerɛ mpo ho
Even if it’s just clothes.	Sɛ ɛyɛ ntade kɛkɛ mpo a.
So this was not a good thing.	Enti na eyi nyɛ ade pa.
So, give it to him.	Enti, ma no.
And please don’t start now.	Na mesrɛ wo, mfi ase mprempren.
I have to believe that	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye saa asɛm no di
That just happened to me.	Ɛno too me ara kwa.
I am part of that group.	Meyɛ saa kuw no fã.
It was something after two.	Na ɛyɛ biribi wɔ abien akyi.
There was no need to do so.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
It would be cold day and night.	Ná awɔw bɛyɛ awia ne anadwo.
He knew what he was doing.	Ná onim nea ɔreyɛ.
I like it many times	M’ani gye ho mpɛn pii
All you want is that.	Nea wopɛ ara ne sɛ.
It was best this way.	Ná eye sen biara wɔ saa kwan yi so.
That’s the real thing.	Ɛno ne ade ankasa.
Most of the time I am alone here	Mpɛn pii no, me nkutoo na mewɔ ha
What’s on the table.	Nea ɛwɔ pon so.
I didn’t need to intervene	Ná enhia sɛ mede me ho gye mu
I glanced out the window	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ mfɛnsere no mu
I’m so excited about that	M’ani agye saa asɛm no ho yiye
Otherwise, the problem would be worse.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, anka ɔhaw no mu bɛyɛ den.
I have some interests	Mewɔ nneɛma bi a m’ani gye ho
That is not our present time.	Ɛno nyɛ yɛn mprempren bere yi.
And that was his right.	Na ɛno ne ne hokwan.
It really does.	Ɛyɛ saa ankasa.
I want to be there right now	Mepɛ sɛ mewɔ hɔ mprempren ara
I see the issue.	Mihu asɛm no.
I wish she was here to enjoy this too	Me yam a anka ɔno nso wɔ ha ma n’ani begye eyi ho
I can’t imagine how hard it would be right now .	Mintumi nsusuw sɛnea anka ɛbɛyɛ den mprempren no ho .
I want to take care of the car today	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ kar no so nnɛ
It has to be all that walking.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa nantew no nyinaa.
Of what it is to be human	Nea ɛyɛ sɛ obi bɛyɛ onipa ho
I can’t take it anymore	Mintumi nnye bio
I believe that	Migye di sɛ .
His head continued to drop.	Ne ti kɔɔ so kɔɔ fam.
I think it all just overwhelmed him today	Misusuw sɛ ne nyinaa hyɛɛ no ​​so nnɛ ara kwa
It wasn’t real! 	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa!
he said to himself.	ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho.
Maybe this thing has played itself out.	Ebia saa ade yi adi agoru wɔ ne ho.
But you didn’t know.	Nanso na wunnim.
I think he likes her	Misusuw sɛ n’ani gye ne ho
Things were still happening.	Ná nneɛma da so ara rekɔ so.
I can’t go to dinner	Mintumi nkɔ anwummere aduan
I liked him but that makes him more creepy	M’ani gyee ne ho nanso ɛno ma ne ho yɛ hu kɛse
In any case, there is nothing to ‘do’.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, biribiara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ ‘yɛ’.
I can’t do this alone	Me nkutoo ntumi nyɛ eyi
I shook hands with each of them	Mede wɔn mu biara nsa bɔɔ mu
Like, really, really good.	Te sɛ, ampa, papa ankasa.
It will be given to them.	Wɔde bɛma wɔn.
I want a picture of us both happy	Mepɛ mfonini a yɛn baanu nyinaa ani agye
It will be a simple book.	Ɛbɛyɛ nhoma a ɛnyɛ den.
The road has gone downhill.	Ɔkwan no akɔ fam.
If he did, I would tell you about it	Sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa a, anka mɛka ho asɛm akyerɛ wo
Too many meetings.	Nhyiam pii dodo.
Most of the time, I do.	Mpɛn pii no, meyɛ saa.
That is a mistake.	Ɛno yɛ mfomso.
Everyone was surprised in some way.	Obiara ho dwiriw no wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
And for the sake of power.	Na tumi nti.
I love the efficiency.	M’ani gye sɛnea wɔde di dwuma yiye ho.
Or if they’re weak it’s hard for me.	Anaasɛ sɛ wɔyɛ mmerɛw a ɛyɛ den ma me.
I still have many friends in this city	Meda so ara wɔ nnamfo pii wɔ kurow yi mu
We all deal with problems every day.	Yɛn nyinaa di ɔhaw ahorow ho dwuma da biara da.
It’s a great opportunity for him.	Ɛyɛ hokwan kɛse ma no.
I didn’t want to hear it again	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete bio
It wasn’t anyone’s home.	Ná ɛnyɛ obiara fie.
But things didn’t go well.	Nanso nneɛma ankɔ yiye.
You may be surprised at what else you can see.	Ebia nneɛma foforo a wubetumi ahu no bɛyɛ wo nwonwa.
I expect you won't be able to do that	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ worentumi nyɛ saa
Maybe this is a moment of.	Ebia eyi yɛ bere tiaa bi a...
I can't understand why	Mintumi nte nea enti a ɛte saa no ase
I know everything you need to know about him	Minim biribiara a ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu fa ne ho
I hope you can help me.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi aboa me.
That was his father's way.	Na ɛno ne ne papa kwan.
I can’t imagine him doing much about it, though.	Nanso, mintumi nsusuw ho sɛ ɔbɛyɛ ho pii.
I can barely get here	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nkɔ ha
Anything can happen.	Biribiara betumi asi.
It is not entirely empty.	Ɛnyɛ nea hwee nni mu koraa.
The study did not end there.	Adesua no ankɔ awiei wɔ hɔ.
Every day, the same thing.	Da biara, ade koro no ara.
There are many things you can do to help your situation.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a wubetumi ayɛ de aboa wo tebea no.
He didn’t know her name.	Ná onnim ne din.
At this very moment.	Saa bere yi ara mu.
I feel stronger now.	Mete nka sɛ me ho yɛ den mprempren.
You are very good at words.	Wo ho akokwaw paa wɔ nsɛm mu.
He had nothing to say to her.	Ná onni asɛm biara a ɔbɛka akyerɛ no.
However, there is something else.	Nanso, biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
I was still doing the same thing	Ná meda so ara yɛ saa ara
I don’t think this was a good idea.	Minsusuw sɛ na eyi yɛ adwene pa.
I know this textbook inside and out	Minim adesua nhoma yi mu ne akyi
I was lying on a bed	Ná meda mpa bi so
It has to get the job done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ edi adwuma no ho dwuma.
Start with something simple.	Fa biribi a ɛnyɛ den fi ase.
I also knew this was not good	Ná minim nso sɛ eyi nyɛ papa
A man had landed on it	Ná ɔbarima bi asi fam wɔ so
I spent the whole morning with your mother.	Me ne wo maame dii anɔpa mũ no nyinaa.
Perhaps not surprising there.	Ebia ɛnyɛ nwonwa wɔ hɔ.
Somehow I completely forgot about this	Ɔkwan bi so no, me werɛ fii eyi koraa
He had no idea at this point.	Ná onni adwene biara wɔ saa bere yi mu.
The present narrative is such a story.	Mprempren asɛm a wɔka no yɛ asɛm a ɛte saa.
It has to be that way.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
I can’t believe it isn’t	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɛnte saa
It’s part and parcel of all of us.	Ɛyɛ yɛn nyinaa fã ne ne fã.
It will be a wonderful addition to your home.	Ɛbɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa a wode bɛka wo fie ho.
It didn’t work for me.	Anyɛ adwuma amma me.
This was the case in a number of cases.	Ná eyi te saa wɔ nsɛm dodow bi mu.
The girl looked at me and my mother.	Abeawa no hwɛɛ me ne me maame.
A city was like that	Ná kurow bi te saa
There were obviously a few things this man didn’t know.	Ɛda adi sɛ na nneɛma kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ a na ɔbarima yi nnim.
Thank you all for your interest.	Meda mo nyinaa ase sɛ mo ani gye ho.
The man was in great pain.	Ɔbarima no de yaw yɛɛ no ​​yaw kɛse.
And so they were beautiful.	Na saa ara na na wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
I still have some time	Meda so ara wɔ bere bi
And this is just amazing.	Na eyi yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
That is not the case with us.	Ɛnte saa wɔ yɛn fam.
I can’t say much about it	Mintumi nka ho asɛm pii
There are some of you who want something.	Wo bi wɔ hɔ a wopɛ biribi.
We may add another group section.	Ebia yɛde kuw fã foforo bɛka ho.
I just want to do things that I really enjoy.	Nea mepɛ ara ne sɛ meyɛ nneɛma a m’ani gye ho ankasa.
I slipped my hands together	Mede me nsa bɔɔ mu
I actually saw it last night	Mihuu no ankasa anadwo a etwaam no
He paints on a strange face.	Ɔyɛ mfonini wɔ anim a ɛyɛ nwonwa so.
I'm still there.	Meda so ara wɔ hɔ.
I was popular at school	Ná nnipa pii ani gye me ho wɔ sukuu mu
I wanted to be nice to him	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ fɛ ma no
And that means either thing happened.	Na ɛno kyerɛ sɛ nneɛma abien no mu biara sii.
I believe in this group.	Migye saa kuw yi di.
I had absolutely no idea what was going on.	Ná minni nea ɛrekɔ so no ho adwene biara koraa.
I forget his name.	Me werɛ fi ne din.
Look at your house.	Hwɛ wo fie.
I think you know exactly what comes next.	Misusuw sɛ wunim nea edi hɔ no yiye.
However, there is a cost to my support.	Nanso, ɛho ka bi wɔ hɔ ma me mmoa no.
I don’t know anyone anymore	Minnim obiara bio
He probably would have been one of them.	Ebia anka ɔbɛyɛ wɔn mu biako.
I feel like something has let it in	Mete nka sɛ biribi ama akɔ mu
But not now.	Nanso ɛnyɛ mprempren.
I hope he recovers well.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ne ho bɛtɔ no yiye.
I want you to be with me	Mepɛ sɛ woka me ho
I wanted to say something, anything	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka biribi, biribiara
That would be too easy.	Ɛno bɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
I care very little about what you do.	Nea woyɛ no ho nhia me kakraa bi pɛ.
I just didn’t know how to tell you	Na minnim sɛnea mɛka akyerɛ wo kɛkɛ
Something has to give.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi ma.
I was also interested in it	Ná m’ani gye ho nso
I’m in love with him	M’ani gyee ne ho
Paper is good.	Krataa yɛ papa.
But that’s the way it is.	Nanso saa na ɛte.
And you don’t have to walk alone.	Na ɛnsɛ sɛ wo nkutoo nantew.
Even for one night.	Anadwo biako mpo.
They took him by his side.	Wɔde no faa ne nkyɛn.
Maybe you’ll all be one.	Ebia mo nyinaa bɛyɛ biako.

Many people can’t do that.	Nnipa pii ntumi nyɛ saa.
Don’t do it, girl.	Nyɛ no, abeawa.
We’ll be happy again.	Yɛn ani begye bio.
So the system is definitely a big part of it.	Enti akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nhyehyɛe no yɛ ne fã kɛse.
You do what you have to do with me.	Wo ne me yɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.

The test is postponed.	Wɔde sɔhwɛ no to nkyɛn.

You have to be here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wowɔ ha.
I was sitting in the background completely	Ná mete akyi koraa

It was a hat.	Ná ɛyɛ kyɛw.
I had no job and no hope	Ná minni adwuma biara na na minni anidaso biara
He has made us his children.	Wayɛ yɛn ne mma.
That was something he should have done.	Ná ɛno yɛ biribi a anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
It wasn’t like that.	Ná ɛnte saa.
Very easy to use.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wode bedi dwuma.

Maybe he would do that.	Ebia na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I knew those things about him	Ná minim saa nneɛma no fa ne ho
I spent too much time in this house	Mede bere pii traa ofie yi mu dodo
The afternoon before the accident.	Awia a edi akwanhyia no anim no.
There is nothing like that.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
He didn't want to hurt her.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ no yaw.
Some things were too complicated.	Ná nneɛma bi yɛ den dodo.
He had many friends.	Ná ɔwɔ nnamfo pii.
They love the language.	Wɔn ani gye kasa no ho.
Very good prices.	Nneɛma bo a eye paa.
We can’t do anything tonight.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ hwee anadwo yi.
Something my wife wants too.	Biribi a me yere nso pɛ.
We’re glad you’re here.	Yɛn ani agye sɛ wowɔ ha.
Some days are painful.	Nna bi yɛ yaw.
I think the only one you have to talk to	Misusuw sɛ nea ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne no nkutoo kasa
I didn’t know you liked them	Ná minnim sɛ w’ani gye wɔn ho
And it was amazing.	Na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I wasn’t alone	Ɛnyɛ me nkutoo na na mewɔ hɔ
I just put them down	Mede wɔn to fam kɛkɛ
Nevertheless, something else was going on.	Ne nyinaa mu no, na biribi foforo nso rekɔ so.
I just couldn’t deal with it right now	Na mintumi ne no nni ho dwuma mprempren ara kɛkɛ
Long after most people had gone.	Bere tenten akyi a na nnipa dodow no ara akɔ no.
I had no other books	Ná minni nhoma foforo biara
I can’t tell you down here	Mintumi nka nkyerɛ wo wɔ fam ha
I glanced at my mother	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ me maame so
I know you want to save them	Minim sɛ wopɛ sɛ wugye wɔn
The first one looked cheap.	Ná nea edi kan no te sɛ nea ne bo nyɛ den.
But most people use this idea over and over again.	Nanso nnipa dodow no ara de saa adwene yi yɛ adwuma mpɛn pii.
I look out into the night	Mehwɛ abɔnten kosi anadwo
I still need something from you	Meda so ara hia biribi fi wo hɔ
That was terrible.	Ná ɛno yɛ hu.
The child should play every day.	Ɛsɛ sɛ abofra no di agoru da biara da.
I can easily do it for you	Ɛnyɛ den sɛ metumi ayɛ ama wo
Money was really hard.	Ná sika ho yɛ den ankasa.
Or even two.	Anaasɛ abien mpo.
Can anyone help me with this ?.	Obi betumi aboa me wɔ eyi ho ?.
After one thing.	Ade biako akyi.
Except for him alone.	Gye sɛ ɔno nkutoo.
I love it when I just think about it.	M’ani gye bere a misusuw ho ara kwa.
This time, you will.	Saa bere yi de, wobɛyɛ saa.
In this system, time becomes money.	Wɔ nhyehyɛe yi mu no, bere bɛyɛ sika.
This was over.	Ná eyi aba awiei.
She is also a beautiful person.	Ɔno nso yɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
We do have them, lots of them.	Yɛwɔ wɔn ampa, wɔn mu pii.
Only he can make the decision.	Ɔno nkutoo na obetumi asi gyinae.
I know what he can do	Minim nea obetumi ayɛ
It was not supposed to be this cold.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ awɔw yi.
I just loved that.	M’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho ara kwa.
You don’t know how it feels.	Wunnim sɛnea ɛte nka.
But that was a lie.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ atoro.
You are here for one reason, and one reason only.	Ade biako nti na wowɔ ha, ne ade biako pɛ nti.
There is something for everyone.	Biribi wɔ hɔ ma obiara.
Now no one seems to be home.	Mprempren ɛte sɛ nea obiara nni fie.
I had to think things through	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw nneɛma ho yiye
This doesn’t just happen over time.	Eyi nkɔ so bere kɔ so ara kwa.
I have to think positively	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw nneɛma pa ho
Maria's past years.	Maria mfe a atwam no.
He loved this moment.	Ná n’ani gye saa bere yi ho.
He had done that before.	Ná wayɛ saa pɛn.
Only for a short time.	Bere tiaa bi pɛ.
But lots of fun.	Nanso anigye pii.
I think it was important to me.	Misusuw sɛ na ɛho hia me.
You have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
No big deal, after all.	Asɛm kɛse biara nni hɔ, ne nyinaa akyi no.
Image is very important.	Mfonini ho hia yiye.
Maybe that’s it.	Ebia ɛno ne no.
And he was very impressed with her.	Na n’ani gyee ne ho paa.
He was planning to do so.	Na ɔreyɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
That’s your way.	Ɛno ne wo kwan.
He had to try.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔbɔ mmɔden.
I do something for him, maybe	Meyɛ biribi ma no, ebia
I knew what he was doing	Ná minim nea ɔreyɛ
I know how to approach them	Minim sɛnea mɛkɔ wɔn nkyɛn
Maybe we can get away with that.	Ebia yebetumi anya yɛn ho afi saa asɛm no ho.
Being a mom was hard.	Ná ɛyɛ den sɛ mɛyɛ maame.
I know what is best for me	Minim nea eye ma me
You can’t treat us like that.	Worentumi ne yɛn nni saa.
That’s the problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
He is in everything.	Ɔwɔ biribiara mu.
Maybe a week.	Ebia dapɛn biako.
It really should be.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa ankasa.
A few hours ago.	Nnɔnhwerew kakraa bi a atwam ni.
That would be really painful.	Ɛno bɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ yaw ankasa.
I had high hopes for us	Ná mewɔ anidaso kɛse ma yɛn
He is the best thing that has happened to me.	Ɔno ne ade a eye sen biara a asi ama me.
Look at people’s eyes.	Hwɛ nnipa ani so.
Which is very little.	Nea ɛyɛ kakraa bi koraa.
She was young and beautiful.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra na na ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Not with him.	Ɛnyɛ ne nkyɛn.
I find the perfect song for her	Mihu dwom a ɛyɛ pɛ ma no
The days were getting longer.	Ná nna no reyɛ tenten.
I hope it all went well	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ne nyinaa kɔɔ yiye
This is the situation we are in today.	Eyi ne tebea a yɛwɔ mu nnɛ.
Those things happen all the time.	Saa nneɛma no kɔ so bere nyinaa.
But otherwise, it was just the two of them.	Nanso sɛ ɛnte saa a, na ɛyɛ wɔn baanu no nkutoo.
I even like them and admire them	M’ani gye wɔn ho mpo na m’ani gye wɔn ho
If we.	Sɛ yɛn.
He was there just for me.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ ma me nkutoo.
This should be in the evening.	Ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ anwummere.
There are two reasons for this.	Nneɛma abien bi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛte saa.
I didn’t know they were friends	Ná minnim sɛ wɔyɛ nnamfo
I can’t talk about it now	Mintumi nka ho asɛm mprempren
I only heard part of it.	Metee ne fã bi kɛkɛ.
It’s what anyone would do.	Ɛyɛ nea anka obiara bɛyɛ.
You completely forget.	Wo werɛ fi koraa.
Play yours just a little better.	Bɔ wo de no yiye kakra kɛkɛ.
Other than that, most of us were pretty good already.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno a, na yɛn mu dodow no ara yɛ fɛ yiye dedaw.
But my name wasn’t me.	Nanso na me din nyɛ me.
A moment later, he was at the back door	Bere tiaa bi akyi no, na ɔwɔ akyi pon no ano
We don’t matter that much, but the kids do.	Yɛn ho nhia pii saa, nanso mmofra no ho hia.
It was midnight.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo fã.
Just include what you think you want.	Nea wususuw sɛ wopɛ no ka ho kɛkɛ.
Good until the very last.	Eye kosi nea etwa to koraa no so.
You can’t treat me like that.	Worentumi ne me nni saa.
That wasn’t the problem.	Na ɛnyɛ ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
Such pictures.	Mfonini ahorow a ɛte saa.
I must take you to him	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede wo kɔ ne nkyɛn
That’s how that worked back then.	Saa na ɛno yɛ adwuma saa bere no.
I know them.	Minim wɔn.
All things in a way.	Nneɛma nyinaa wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
Bring this to an end.	Fa eyi ba awiei.
I never knew them either.	Ná minnim wɔn nso da.
We are just human beings.	Yɛyɛ nnipa ara kwa.
Anything can happen next.	Biribiara betumi asi akyi.
I knew it had to be why	Ná minim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea enti a ɛte saa
Anyway.	Ɛnyɛ hwee.
I think you have a good thing going here	Misusuw sɛ wowɔ ade pa bi a ɛrekɔ ha
No one knows anything.	Obiara nnim hwee.
I know him very well.	Minim no yiye.
The headaches are gone.	Ti a ɛyɛ no yaw no afi hɔ.
My plan was a good one.	Ná me nhyehyɛe no yɛ nea eye.
That’s not like any of them.	Ɛno nte sɛ wɔn mu biara.
This was not the first time.	Na ɛnyɛ eyi ne bere a edi kan.
I still had work to do	Ná meda so ara wɔ adwuma a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ
The first kindergarten.	Mmofra sukuu a edi kan no.
But there is a lot going on.	Nanso nneɛma pii rekɔ so.
I wonder why he knows these things	Misusuw nea enti a onim saa nneɛma yi ho
It’s the first days.	Ɛyɛ nna a edi kan.
I know he knows what’s going on	Minim sɛ onim nea ɛrekɔ so
I'm sure kids will love them.	Migye di sɛ mmofra ani begye wɔn ho.
The views were great.	Ná adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ no yɛ kɛse.
I think you have a good mouth.	Misusuw sɛ wowɔ ano pa.
I would tell him later.	Anka mɛka akyerɛ no akyiri yi.
We have three hours of school tonight.	Yɛwɔ sukuu nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa anadwo yi.
All they did was their job.	Nea na wɔyɛ ara ne wɔn adwuma.
Good job, boy.	Adwuma pa, abarimaa.
I saw water.	Mihuu nsu.
Maybe that can help you.	Ebia ɛno betumi aboa wo.
A boy or girl who should never do that	Abarimaa anaa abeawa a ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa da
This was also a wonderful time.	Saa bere yi nso na ɛyɛ bere a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
An interesting thought touched him	Adwene bi a ɛyɛ anigye kaa ne ho
You can kick if you want.	Wubetumi abɔ wo nan sɛ wopɛ a.
This was of great importance.	Ná eyi yɛ nea ɛho hia kɛse.
Finally, he stepped inside.	Awiei koraa no, ɔde ne nan sii mu.
And it will be quick.	Na ɛbɛyɛ ntɛm.
Something completely different.	Biribi foforo koraa.
I sit on the bed looking down.	Mete mpa no so hwɛ fam.
I had the bus to myself	Ná mewɔ bɔs no ma me ho
This was not always the case.	Ná eyi nyɛ nea ɛte saa bere nyinaa.
At least one more.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, biako bio.
I really like it here	M’ani gye ho paa wɔ ha
But the jobs are still lacking in manufacturing.	Nanso nnwuma no da so ara nni hɔ wɔ nneɛma a wɔyɛ mu.
Thank you so much for everyone involved.	Meda mo ase pii wɔ obiara a ɔde ne ho hyɛɛ mu no ho.
There are a few things here that seem to work well.	Nneɛma kakraa bi wɔ ha a ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
I don’t know exactly how much time has passed	Minnim bere dodow a atwam ankasa
I know this first hand	Minim saa nsa a edi kan yi
You were out there with him.	Na wo ne no wɔ abɔnten hɔ.
It is true that there is hardly a normal man	Ɛyɛ nokware sɛ ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɔbarima a ɔte ase nni hɔ
There were several reasons for this.	Ná nneɛma pii nti na ɛte saa.
I didn’t want to go to school	Ná mempɛ sɛ mekɔ sukuu
Your job is done.	Wo adwuma no aba awiei.
He knows full well that he wants her.	Onim yiye sɛ ɔpɛ no.
No one else knew.	Ná obi foforo biara nnim.
That was a very scary thing.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu paa.
I always thought so	Bere nyinaa na misusuw sɛ ɛte saa
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa.
This prospect is not included in the current situation	Saa anidaso yi nka mprempren tebea no ho
So what happened to him.	So nea esii no.
Take the money.	Fa sika no.
I was really looking forward to it	Ná mehwɛ kwan ankasa
There are so many better things.	Nneɛma a eye sen saa pii wɔ hɔ.
This solved scheduling issues	Eyi dii nhyehyɛe ho nsɛm ho dwuma
I know exactly what happened	Minim nea esii no yiye
I really enjoyed the game.	M’ani gyee agoru no ho ankasa.
I’ve made up my mind.	Mayɛ m’adwene.
Just with his wife.	Ɔne ne yere nkutoo.
He laid them on the bed.	Ɔde wɔn too mpa no so.
So many times lately he was alone.	Enti mpɛn pii nnansa yi na ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
I know you know what it’s like	Minim sɛ wunim sɛnea ɛte
I wish it wasn’t	Me yam a anka ɛnyɛ saa
Even if I’m not on it.	Sɛ me nni so mpo a.
Take after my father.	Fa me papa akyi.
It was actually a really exciting day for him.	Na ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye ankasa ma no ankasa.
I think that’s important.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ho hia.
The same is true even today.	Saa ara na ɛte nnɛ mpo.
I can barely feel them	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nte wɔn nka
And that’s the best news.	Na ɛno ne asɛm a eye sen biara.
I love her sophisticated and beautiful style	M’ani gye ne su a ɛyɛ nwonwa na ɛyɛ fɛ no ho
I don’t think it does	Minsusuw sɛ ɛyɛ saa
People were starting to panic a bit.	Ná nkurɔfo afi ase rebɔ hu kakra.
I’d love to talk to him too.	M’ani begye ho sɛ me nso me ne no kasa.
I guess that means you probably can too.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno kyerɛ sɛ ebia wo nso wubetumi ayɛ.
I can show you if you want	Metumi de akyerɛ wo sɛ wopɛ a
The person looks at you.	Onipa no hwɛ wo.
Maybe that’s what you want.	Ebia ɛno ne nea wopɛ.
I feel like I’ve done something	Mete nka sɛ mayɛ biribi
They are very important to me.	Wɔyɛ nea ɛho hia me kɛse.
There was nothing remarkable here.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ha.
Each one was a story.	Ná wɔn mu biara yɛ asɛm bi.
Please give me a life.	Mesrɛ mo, momma me nkwa.
It’s a real pleasure to work with them.	Ɛyɛ anigye ankasa sɛ wo ne wɔn bɛyɛ adwuma.
If it works.	Sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma a.
That’s the whole problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no nyinaa.
Make the most of every moment.	Fa bere biara di dwuma yiye.
I am the target.	Me na meyɛ nea wɔde wɔn ani asi so.
There was nothing wrong with that team that year.	Na bɔne biara nni saa kuw no ho saa afe no.
I knew the idea of ​​what was going on.	Ná minim nea ɛrekɔ so no ho adwene.
So it lived and three years.	Enti na ɛte ase na mfe abiɛsa.
That can pass.	Ɛno betumi atwam.
We do such a thing.	Yɛyɛ ade a ɛte saa.
There are many factors at stake	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛwɔ asɛm no mu
Without you people, none of this is possible.	Sɛ mo nkurɔfo nni hɔ a, eyi mu biara ntumi nyɛ yiye.
I was going all in with that one	Na me ne saa biako no rekɔ mu nyinaa
I think our kids like us	Misusuw sɛ yɛn mma ani gye yɛn ho
He wanted to do something.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ biribi.
So it seems good.	Enti ɛte sɛ nea eye.
I knew what he could do	Ná minim nea obetumi ayɛ
I always include something he likes.	Mede biribi a n’ani gye ho ka ho bere nyinaa.
It’s great to be here.	Ɛyɛ kɛse sɛ wowɔ ha.
That was not what I wanted to do	Ná ɛnyɛ nea mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa
Just stunning pictures	Mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ nwonwa ara kwa
Maybe it’s a beautiful one.	Ebia ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ fɛ.
However, this is something that many people can enjoy.	Nanso, eyi yɛ biribi a nnipa pii betumi anya mu anigye.
I need to talk to him	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa
I’d love to be able to give my opinion.	M’ani begye ho sɛ metumi de m’adwene ama.
He also starred in a few films.	Ɔyɛɛ sini ahorow kakraa bi nso.
I just don’t like it very much.	M’ani nnye ho kɛse kɛkɛ.
It was a pleasant evening.	Ná ɛyɛ anwummere a ɛyɛ anigye.
I don’t know, man.	Minnim, ɔbarima.
He didn't know but he hoped.	Ná onnim nanso na ɔwɔ anidaso.
I don’t know what to do	Minnim nea menyɛ
I also have to wonder if that is even possible	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho nso sɛ ebia ɛno betumi ayɛ yiye mpo anaa
It doesn’t matter to me one way or the other.	Ɛnyɛ hwee mma me ɔkwan biako so anaa ɔkwan foforo so.
He was in trouble.	Ná ɔwɔ ɔhaw mu.
I know one of the people who works there	Minim nnipa a wɔyɛ adwuma wɔ hɔ no mu biako
I was stronger than him.	Ná me ho yɛ den sen no.
I use it almost every time	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mede di dwuma bere biara
I wanted to feel how cold it was for myself	Ná mepɛ sɛ mete sɛnea awɔw wom no nka ma me ho
It’s very good for you.	Ɛyɛ papa paa ma wo.
I understand you very well.	Mete wo ase yiye.
A simple name for a weak man	Ɔbarima a ɔyɛ mmerɛw din a ɛnyɛ den
That would have been a long time ago.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ bere tenten a atwam ni.
He controls everything from here on out.	Ɔno na odi biribiara so fi ha rekɔ.
The complete picture.	Mfonini a edi mũ no.
I couldn’t even go to school	Anka mintumi nkɔ sukuu mpo
You’re like me.	Wo te sɛ me.
I think he might have been a professional	Misusuw sɛ ebia na ɔyɛ obi a onim adwuma yiye
I have your stuff in the car below	Mede wo nneɛma wɔ kar no mu wɔ ase hɔ
There are some problems.	Ɔhaw ahorow bi wɔ hɔ.
I think that will go to someone else.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno bɛkɔ obi foforo nkyɛn.
I didn’t know those things still existed	Ná minnim sɛ saa nneɛma no da so ara wɔ hɔ
I'm a little overwhelmed by everything	Biribiara ahyɛ me so kakra
Not everyone likes it.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na n’ani gye ho.
I couldn’t help but admire him	Na mintumi nyɛ hwee sɛ m’ani begye ne ho
He wants to take care of them himself.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa hwɛ wɔn.
I think you could be in danger	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi akɔ asiane mu
Thank you all for that.	Meda mo nyinaa ase wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
I was not strong enough	Ná me ho nyɛ den sɛnea ɛsɛ
You can go for it.	Wubetumi akɔ.
I still do that.	Meda so ara yɛ saa.
We do them in the background.	Yɛyɛ wɔn wɔ akyi.
Think of me as a guy.	Susuw me ho hwɛ.
This would take some days.	Ná eyi begye nna bi.
I hope it works for you!	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma ama wo!
I know, and you know too.	Minim, na wo nso wunim.
I look to him every day for it	Mehwɛ ne nkyɛn da biara da wɔ ho
I would say most of the time he doesn’t	Meka sɛ mpɛn dodow no ara na ɔnyɛ saa
I was doing my homework when the phone rang	Ná mereyɛ me fie nnwuma bere a telefon no bɔɔ
That let the packaging out of them.	Ɛno maa nneɛma a wɔde ahyɛ mu no fii wɔn mu.
But nothing happens.	Nanso biribiara mma.
Something quirky and new, something you’ll love.	Biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa na ɛyɛ foforo, biribi a w’ani begye ho.
I think two out of three wasn’t bad	Misusuw sɛ na abiɛsa biara mu abien nyɛ bɔne
And let your children eat them.	Na ma wo mma nni wɔn.
I was still unemployed	Ná meda so ara nni adwuma
I didn’t know how it would work out.	Ná minnim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye.
No one was surprised.	Ná obiara ho nnye no.
I touched the handle	Mede me nsa kaa nsa no
I spent the whole weekend in bed.	Mede dapɛn awiei no nyinaa traa mpa so.
Man, that much was true	Ɔbarima, na saa dodow no ara yɛ nokware
You will be very comfortable here.	Wo ho bɛtɔ wo yiye wɔ ha.
But none of them had any idea what to do.	Nanso na wɔn mu biara nni nea ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ho adwene biara.
I want to be after something, not just someone.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi akyi, na ɛnyɛ obi kɛkɛ.
I can see that, anyone can	Metumi ahu sɛ, obiara betumi
Go through the door.	Fa ɔpon no mu kɔ.
We were in it.	Ná yɛwɔ mu.
I have no idea why.	Minnim nea enti a wɔyɛ saa no ho adwene biara.
I touched it with my hand.	Mede me nsa kaa ho.
My old self was gone.	Ná me ho dedaw no nni hɔ bio.
That is an ideal situation.	Ɛno yɛ tebea a eye sen biara.
After a while, he wasn’t.	Bere bi akyi no, na ɔnyɛ saa.
It was a really good night for us	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo pa ankasa ma yɛn
I am a very, very bad person.	Meyɛ onipa bɔne paa paa.
However, it is not without risk.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea asiane biara nni mu.
I should have taken a closer look	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ no yiye
It just seems more real to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware kɛse ma me ara kwa.
I'm sorry about that too	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ ɛno nso ho
Maybe that was the point.	Ebia na ɛno ne asɛm no.
And this makes things much easier.	Na eyi ma nneɛma yɛ mmerɛw kɛse.
He used it.	Ɔde dii dwuma.
I just didn’t know why	Na minnim nea enti a ɛte saa ara kwa
That seems to be what happened here.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno na esii wɔ ha.
Tomorrow or the next day will be fine.	Ɔkyena anaa da a edi hɔ no bɛyɛ yiye.
Given a first name.	Wɔde din a edi kan ama.
I wasn’t always so lucky	Ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na na mewɔ anigye saa
I can bring you there	Metumi de wo aba hɔ
They just bring them inside.	Wɔde wɔn ba mu ara kwa.
I know how well that would have gone.	Minim sɛnea anka ɛno bɛkɔ yiye.
I owe him more than that	Mede no ka sen saa
That was the first surprise, you know.	Ɛno ne ade a edi kan a ɛyɛ nwonwa, wunim.
I still have friends there.	Meda so ara wɔ nnamfo wɔ hɔ.
They do so for pleasure.	Anigye nti na wɔyɛ saa.
That’s my name for him.	Ɛno ne me din ma no.
Maybe my mom, but not my dad.	Ebia me maame, nanso ɛnyɛ me papa.
I’m always confused.	M’adwene tu bere nyinaa.
I didn’t want to be that guy	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa ɔbarima no
I believe it is not.	Migye di sɛ ɛnte saa.
I had no idea something like that would happen	Ná minnim sɛ biribi a ɛte saa bɛba
I was pretty sure no one knew much about him	Ná migye di yiye sɛ obiara nnim ne ho nsɛm pii
You will drive us there.	Wobɛka yɛn kar akɔ hɔ.
I think he does know what he is doing	Misusuw sɛ onim nea ɔreyɛ no ampa
I love it here, but I’m running out of time	M’ani gye ho wɔ ha, nanso me bere rekɔ so
It never works.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma da.
And you don’t like this.	Na w’ani nnye eyi ho.
I just saw it about a week ago	Mihuu no bɛyɛ dapɛn biako a atwam ni ara pɛ
Fear of good and evil.	Pa ne bɔne ho suro.
I couldn’t believe that	Ná mintumi nnye saa asɛm no nni
I believe it is not.	Migye di sɛ ɛnte saa.
He really wanted to.	Ná ɔpɛ ankasa.
We offer amazing value.	Yɛde bo a ɛyɛ nwonwa ma.
His father.	Ne papa.
He introduces himself.	Ɔde ne ho kyerɛ.
You can have it if you can use it.	Wubetumi anya bi sɛ wubetumi de adi dwuma a.
I think it was starting to go downhill	Misusuw sɛ na afi ase rekɔ fam
You just hope you do your best	Wowɔ anidaso ara kwa sɛ wobɛyɛ nea wubetumi biara
Free information is provided.	Nsɛm a wɔde ma kwa.
And there is your real test.	Na wo sɔhwɛ ankasa wɔ hɔ.
Road map.	Ɔkwan ho mfonini.
I'm sorry for you.	Mepa wo kyɛw.
I didn’t even know the truth	Ná minnim nokware no mpo
But look at it.	Nanso hwɛ mu.
If you want, I can help you do it	Sɛ wopɛ a, metumi aboa wo ma woayɛ
One important aspect is the checklist.	Ade biako a ɛho hia ne nhyehyɛe a wɔde hwɛ nneɛma mu.
It’s not what you think it is.	Ɛnyɛ nea wususuw sɛ ɛte no.
I just knew it was important	Ná minim ara kwa sɛ ɛho hia
See if you can figure out what it is.	Hwɛ sɛ wubetumi ahu nea ɛyɛ anaa.
I was next in line.	Ná me na edi hɔ.
You enjoy those things while you can.	W’ani gye saa nneɛma no ho bere a wubetumi no.
I should have said something then	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribi saa bere no
It was after midnight and towards morning.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo fã akyi na ɛrekɔ anɔpa.
Or maybe there was more to it.	Anaasɛ ebia na pii wɔ ho sen saa.
Two important results can be seen in this figure.	Yebetumi ahu nneɛma abien a ɛho hia afi mu aba wɔ saa mfonini yi mu.
I can’t think anymore.	Mintumi nsusuw nneɛma ho bio.
This is a new thing.	Eyi yɛ ade foforo.
I nodded to the man.	Mede me ti too fam kyerɛɛ ɔbarima no.
I shouldn’t have done that	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa
But maybe that was the point.	Nanso ebia na ɛno ne asɛm no.
I just want everyone to sit down first	Mepɛ sɛ obiara di kan tra ase kɛkɛ
That actually works well for me.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma yiye ma me ankasa.
I wonder why he was here	Misusuw nea enti a na ɔwɔ ha no ho
Just saying it like it’s okay.	Sɛ wobɛka no kɛkɛ te sɛ nea ɛnyɛ hwee.
I was shocked when I heard what had happened	Me ho dwiriw me bere a metee nea asi no
I knew many of them well	Ná minim wɔn mu pii yiye
This is very exciting for me.	Eyi yɛ anigye kɛse ma me.
I owe him so much, anyway	Mede no ka pii saa, ɔkwan biara so
I intend to go tomorrow	Meyɛ m’adwene sɛ mɛkɔ ɔkyena
When things go spectacularly wrong, you know he’s there.	Sɛ nneɛma nkɔ yiye wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so a, wunim sɛ ɔwɔ hɔ.
I even knew him on the surface	Ná minim no mpo wɔ ani so
You're just in time.	Woayɛ bere mu ara kwa.
I knew exactly what this was about	Ná minim nea eyi fa ho ankasa
That’s a staggering number.	Ɛno yɛ dodow a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
There are movie characters.	Sini mu nnipa wɔ hɔ.
I know you do that.	Minim sɛ woyɛ saa.
It wasn’t that good.	Ná ɛnyɛ papa saa.
This isn’t him.	Eyi nyɛ ɔno.
They are both part of the same system.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa yɛ nhyehyɛe koro no ara fã.
I still felt incredibly weak	Ná meda so ara te nka sɛ mayɛ mmerɛw a ɛyɛ nwonwa
I still had trouble walking on them	Ná meda so ara yɛ ɔhaw wɔ wɔn so nantew
I can’t thank him enough	Mintumi nna no ase sɛnea ɛsɛ
The same is true for us today.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ yɛn fam nnɛ.
I didn’t want to hear it	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete
I would deal with them later or tomorrow	Ná me ne wɔn bedi akyiri yi anaa ɔkyena
Just like your car.	Te sɛ wo kar no ara pɛ.
I am not a little cold.	Menyɛ awɔw kakra.
He put his money away.	Ɔde ne sika no too hɔ.
Again thank you!!.	Bio nso meda wo ase!!.
And so he told me.	Na saa na ɔka kyerɛɛ me.
Look at it, it’s hard to do.	Hwɛ no, ɛyɛ den sɛ wobɛyɛ.
I owe myself that much	Mede me ho ka saa kɛse no
This time, it wasn’t his fault.	Saa bere yi de, na ɛnyɛ ne mfomso.
Do whatever you want with it, use it how you want.	Yɛ nea wopɛ biara ne no, fa no di dwuma sɛnea wopɛ.
I really didn’t want to go	Ankasa na mempɛ sɛ mekɔ
I hope my team is better this year	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ me kuw no bɛyɛ papa afe yi
Maybe I just want you all to be me	Ebia mepɛ sɛ mo nyinaa yɛ me ho ara kwa
They are really perfect for each other.	Wɔyɛ pɛ ma wɔn ho wɔn ho ankasa.
Every year the hands ran free.	Afe biara na nsa no tu mmirika a ɛnyɛ hwee.
I should have checked the time.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ bere no.
I have the list of participants	Mewɔ wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛɛ mu no din
I shouldn’t be here at all, really	Ɛnsɛ sɛ mewɔ ha koraa, ampa
I think most of them didn’t tell	Misusuw sɛ wɔn mu dodow no ara anka ankyerɛ
I always wanted to go there and he did	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ bere nyinaa na ɔno nso yɛɛ saa
I’m really excited.	M’ani agye ankasa.
I just couldn’t let him	Na mintumi mma no kwan kɛkɛ
I thought about you a lot the first few years	Misusuw wo ho pii wɔ mfe kakraa a edi kan no mu
That is the truth.	Ɛno ne nokware no.
I shouldn’t have done anything at all	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribiara koraa
I think you might like it	Misusuw sɛ ebia w’ani begye ho
Not everyone can do that.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na obetumi ayɛ saa.
The object itself must be significant.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ade no ankasa yɛ nea ɛho hia.
I know that was the general idea	Minim sɛ na ɛno ne adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ nyinaa
So much so, so much.	Enti, pii saa.
He should have done that much.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa pii no.
Nobody likes that.	Obiara ani nnye saa asɛm no ho.
Most of these speeches are exclusive	Saa kasa ahorow yi mu dodow no ara yɛ nea wɔka nkutoo
Look at the man.	Hwɛ ɔbarima no.
My head hurt immediately	Me ti yɛɛ me yaw ntɛm ara
I think we could make a great team.	Misusuw sɛ yebetumi ayɛ kuw kɛse bi.
I love your clothes, by the way	M’ani gye wo ntade ho, ɔkwan bi so no
Whether he does or not is another matter	Sɛ́ ɔyɛ saa anaasɛ ɔnyɛ no yɛ asɛm foforo
It seems more obvious now.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛda adi kɛse mprempren.
Not in that order.	Ɛnyɛ saa nhyehyɛe no mu.
And your mother's, too.	Na wo maame de no nso.
Things have been very difficult in my house.	Nneɛma ayɛ den yiye wɔ me fie.
I was with him at every opportunity	Ná me ne no wɔ hokwan biara mu
It didn’t work out too well.	Anyɛ yiye dodo.
I can't use your real name	Mintumi mfa wo din ankasa nni dwuma
It was very impressive.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye.
These problems will come and go.	Saa ɔhaw ahorow yi bɛba na akɔ.
And he will help you.	Na ɔbɛboa wo.
He had to talk to someone.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne obi kasa.
I should never have doubted you	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ migye mo ho kyim da
I wanted someone else to work with him	Ná mepɛ sɛ obi foforo ne no yɛ adwuma
I couldn’t go on like nothing was wrong.	Na mintumi nkɔ so te sɛ nea biribiara nyɛ bɔne.
I shouldn't have been like that	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meyɛ obi a ɔte saa
A long pause followed as they both stared at the animals	Gyinae tenten bi dii akyi bere a wɔn baanu nyinaa hwɛɛ mmoa no denneennen no
I just used my stuff	Mede me nneɛma dii dwuma ara kwa
And this is a great one.	Na eyi yɛ kɛse.
I like being nice.	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Everything the man said was true.	Biribiara a ɔbarima no kae no yɛ nokware.
I could use some help getting things done	Metumi de mmoa bi adi dwuma de ayɛ nneɛma
That’s what’s important.	Ɛno ne nea ɛho hia.
I couldn’t do that to him	Na mintumi nyɛ no saa
Look, my name is.	Hwɛ, me din de.
I didn’t want him to take risks	Ná mempɛ sɛ ɔde ne ho to asiane mu
Otherwise, they are happy.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, wɔn ani agye.
I quickly followed suit.	Meyɛɛ ntɛm dii akyi.
Otherwise, they were weak.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, na wɔyɛ mmerɛw.
I am nervous about everything	Me ho yɛ me hyew wɔ biribiara ho
The setting is most beautiful.	Tebea no yɛ fɛ sen biara.
I'll be a little surprised if that doesn't happen.	Sɛ ɛno ankɔ so a, ɛbɛyɛ me nwonwa kakra.
I did pretty good there	Meyɛɛ papa yiye wɔ hɔ
But he had it in him.	Nanso na ɔwɔ bi wɔ ne mu.
But as it is it was good.	Nanso sɛnea ɛte no na ɛyɛ papa.
Again, not the best of the day.	Bio nso, ɛnyɛ da no mu nea eye sen biara.
Get close to him.	Bɛn no.
I really do, really.	Meyɛ saa ankasa, ampa.
I thought that would be great	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ kɛse
It’s never pretty.	Ɛnyɛ fɛ da.
I feel his fear too	Mete ne suro nso nka
I forgot all about it	Me werɛ fii ne nyinaa
I could tell him later	Ná metumi aka akyerɛ no akyiri yi
I have brought hair.	Mede ti nhwi aba.
I didn’t even have a job	Ná minni adwuma mpo
I loved the movie.	M’ani gyee sini no ho.
I forgot how well he knew me	Me werɛ fii sɛnea onim me yiye no
Start with a simple mindset.	Fa adwene a ɛyɛ mmerɛw fi ase.
I thought you did.	Misusuwii sɛ woyɛ saa.
But one thing is in common.	Nanso ade biako na ɛyɛ pɛ.
To do this we need to process their incident.	Sɛ yɛbɛyɛ eyi a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ wɔn asɛm a esii no ho adwuma.
He had to take another test.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ sɔhwɛ foforo.
That was a very popular thing.	Ná ɛno yɛ ade a nkurɔfo ani gye ho paa.
I could still get you out of here.	Ná meda so ara tumi yi wo fi ha.
But that seemed impossible now.	Nanso na ɛte sɛ nea ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye mprempren.
My head hurt.	Me ti yɛɛ me yaw.
I hope to get into this this summer	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mɛkɔ eyi mu wɔ awɔw bere yi mu
Take me home, do whatever you want with me.	Fa me kɔ fie, yɛ me nea wopɛ biara.
No problems so far.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ de besi nnɛ.
The child he couldn’t forget.	Abofra a na ne werɛ ntumi mfi no.
All this work with me.	Saa adwuma yi nyinaa ne me.
I was surprised to see a door	Me ho dwiriw me sɛ mihu ɔpon bi
Apparently a few years have passed.	Ɛda adi sɛ mfe kakraa bi na atwam.
It hurts me to do it.	Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ meyɛ.
I didn’t really know what that move would be	Ná minnim nea saa tu no bɛyɛ ankasa
However, it must have been a very common idea.	Nanso, ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ adwene a abu so paa.
At all hazards, really.	Wɔ asiane biara mu, ampa.
I stroke it repeatedly	Mede me nsa bɔ no mpɛn pii
It has gone down.	Akɔ fam.
I want to spend the night at your house	Mepɛ sɛ meda wo fie anadwo
I just felt for her situation	Metee nka wɔ ne tebea no ho ara kwa
I think of his wife	Misusuw ne yere ho
That’s hard for me and important.	Ɛno yɛ nea ɛyɛ den ma me na ɛho hia.
He knows this.	Onim eyi.
I know what it’s like	Minim sɛnea ɛte
I have no idea where it is	Minni baabi a ɛwɔ ho adwene biara
He did it very well.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​yiye paa.
Add more water, if needed.	Fa nsu pii ka ho, sɛ ɛho hia a.
None of them had looked like their father.	Ná wɔn mu biara nyɛɛ sɛ wɔn papa.
Take it out and control yourself.	Yi fi mu na di wo ho so.
I was worried about him	Ná ne ho asɛm haw me
However, I still find it all a little strange	Nanso, meda so ara hu sɛ ne nyinaa yɛ nwonwa kakra
I can describe it that way.	Metumi aka ho asɛm saa.
I shouldn’t have watched	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mehwɛ
He was also hearing.	Ná ɔte asɛm nso.
I have much to tell you	Mewɔ pii a mɛka akyerɛ wo
I hope so, anyway.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa, ɔkwan biara so.
I watch for a moment longer	Mehwɛ bere tiaa bi bio
I told them it was fine	Meka kyerɛɛ wɔn sɛ ɛyɛ papa
I gave it to the police	Mede maa polisifo
And that’s what it is.	Na ɛno ne.
I was just a little lucky	Ná mewɔ anigye kakra kɛkɛ
More information below.	Nsɛm pii wɔ ase ha.
You want it.	Wopɛ no.
And maybe he was.	Na ebia na ɔte saa.
I actually had one.	Ná mewɔ bi ankasa.
It wasn’t any animal.	Ná ɛnyɛ aboa biara.
It wasn’t supposed to be.	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
That’s my problem.	Ɛno ne me haw.
I could just see the words	Ná metumi ahu nsɛm no ara kwa
Maybe those things are true.	Ebia saa nneɛma no yɛ nokware.
The quality was great overall.	Ná su no yɛ kɛse wɔ ne nyinaa mu.
It didn’t do anything for me.	Anyɛ hwee amma me.
It is a painting.	Ɛyɛ mfonini a wɔde ayɛ mfonini.
Look at me.	Hwɛ sɛ me.
Maybe he could.	Ebia na obetumi.
In a sense, he is real.	Ɔkwan bi so no, ɔwɔ hɔ ankasa.
I really need to know	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu ankasa
But not like me.	Nanso ɛnyɛ sɛ me.
I didn't know if what my mother said was true	Ná minnim sɛ ebia nsɛm a maame kae no yɛ nokware anaa
Who wanted a child.	Hena na na ɔpɛ abofra.
Not good, not bad.	Ɛnyɛ papa, ɛnyɛ bɔne.
Let him go.	Ma no nkɔ.
What you say is interesting.	Nea woka no yɛ anigye.
Say nothing about anyone in this article.	Nka biribiara mfa obiara ho wɔ asɛm yi mu.
I tell the story, as you see it	Meka asɛm no, sɛnea wuhu no
But it’s not surprising.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nwonwa.
However, the situation is far from clear.	Nanso, tebea no mu nna hɔ koraa.
I understood what he was doing	Metee nea na ɔreyɛ no ase
Everything will be fine.	Biribiara bɛyɛ yiye.
However, they are amazing.	Nanso, wɔyɛ nwonwa.
Just try a little harder.	Bɔ mmɔden kakra kɛkɛ.
I guess that doesn’t mean much to you	Misusuw sɛ ɛno nkyerɛ pii mma wo
I'm really sick of it	Me ho ayɛ me yaw ankasa
I love you, you love me	Mepɛ wo, wo pɛ me
I look forward to all of you being there	Mehwɛ kwan sɛ mo nyinaa bɛba hɔ
And we hope for the best somehow.	Na yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ nea eye sen biara bɛba ɔkwan bi so.
And yet it’s a lie.	Na nanso ɛyɛ atoro.
' I !.	' ME !.
Good food is really available and inexpensive.	Aduan pa wɔ hɔ ankasa na ne bo nyɛ den.
She was achingly beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ yaw so.
The whole book.	Nhoma no nyinaa.
I couldn’t understand him	Na mintumi nte ne ase
Just like him.	Te sɛ ɔno ara pɛ.
I loved hanging out with him and doing things with him	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ me ne no bɛbɔ ne ho na me ne no ayɛ nneɛma
Something needs to be done about that	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ biribi fa saa asɛm no ho
I couldn't believe he could run that fast	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛ obetumi atu mmirika saa
I think it would be amazing	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nwonwa
I wanted to see him	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu no
So that’s in me, definitely.	Enti ɛno wɔ me mu, akyinnye biara nni ho.
I talk to him every day.	Me ne no kasa da biara da.
I slip out of my shoes	Mede me ho fi me mpaboa mu
I see that.	Mihu saa.
Yours is so beautiful.	Wo de no yɛ fɛ yiye.
They were new people.	Ná wɔyɛ nnipa foforo.
I hope you love learning and love school	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani gye adesua ho na w’ani gye sukuu ho
That person can do with it as they please.	Saa onipa no betumi de ayɛ sɛnea ɔpɛ.
There is a situation here fraught with trouble and danger.	Tebea bi wɔ ha a ɔhaw ne asiane ahyɛ mu ma.
Or maybe we can’t.	Anaasɛ ebia yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
I would, if it were me	Anka mɛyɛ, sɛ ɛyɛ me a
I don’t need to tell you that	Ɛho nhia sɛ meka saa kyerɛ wo
I can make you one better	Metumi ayɛ wo biako yiye
Empty windows are also a problem.	Mfɛnsere a hwee nni mu no nso yɛ ɔhaw.
Think about what you want to do.	Susuw nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ ho.
Once a dog, always a dog.	Bere bi a na ɔyɛ ɔkraman, bere nyinaa na ɔyɛ ɔkraman.
I hope we can remain friends	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ yebetumi akɔ so ayɛ nnamfo
Whatever they like.	Biribiara a wɔn ani gye ho.
It’s his right.	Ɛyɛ ne hokwan.
However, it doesn’t matter.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ hwee.
The night was hot.	Ná anadwo no mu yɛ hyew.
He is one of our own.	Ɔyɛ yɛn ankasa mu biako.
I got too big too soon	Meyɛɛ kɛse dodo ntɛm dodo
Almost anything will be fine.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ biribiara bɛyɛ yiye.
Or at least not really any of them.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ wɔn mu biara ankasa.
If we are ever in it.	Sɛ yɛwɔ mu da bi a.
I know exactly what he would say	Minim nea anka ɔbɛka no yiye
Below are my current favorites.	Ase hɔ no yɛ nea m’ani gye ho mprempren.
I know you have to do this alone	Minim sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wo nkutoo na woyɛ eyi
We can do it.	Yebetumi ayɛ.
What music means.	Nea nnwom kyerɛ.
I’m really enjoying it.	M’ani gye ho ankasa.
I really want to bring your best stuff	Mepɛ ankasa sɛ mede wo nneɛma a eye sen biara no ba
Maybe he brings something else.	Ebia ɔde biribi foforo nso ba.
The opportunities come.	Hokwan ahorow a ɛwɔ hɔ no ba.
This was not part of the plan.	Ná eyi nyɛ nhyehyɛe no fã.
I couldn’t believe this was actually happening	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛ eyi rekɔ so ankasa
As much as possible.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ yiye biara.
I loved those clothes, though.	Nanso, na m’ani gye saa ntade no ho.
And the situation would improve.	Na na tebea no bɛyɛ yiye.
Hopefully one day he can do that with everyone.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ da bi obetumi ne obiara ayɛ saa.
He thought about his words.	Osusuw ne nsɛm no ho.
There was nothing else.	Ná biribi foforo biara nni hɔ.
As such, it may not always be the first condition.	Sɛnea ɛte no, ebia ɛnyɛ bere nyinaa na ɛbɛyɛ tebea a edi kan.
Not much, but it’s home.	Ɛnyɛ pii, nanso ɛyɛ fie.
I know there is a man	Minim sɛ ɔbarima bi wɔ hɔ
It really is that simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa ankasa.
It shouldn’t feel this good.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛte nka sɛ ɛyɛ papa yi.
I was a little shocked	Me ho dwiriw me kakra
But too quickly.	Nanso ntɛmntɛm dodo.
I really like you that much	M’ani gye wo ho saa ankasa
I knew something had happened	Ná minim sɛ biribi asi
It’s not that common.	Ɛnyɛ nea abu so saa.
It’s their own fault, and everyone else’s risk.	Ɛyɛ wɔn ankasa mfomso, na obiara asiane.
I can’t let you go	Mintumi mma wo nkɔ
I move on to the last car	Mekɔ so kɔ kar a etwa to no so
Thank you for the idea.	Meda mo ase wɔ adwene no ho.
I wanted to surprise him.	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ no nwonwa.
I'm not that bad about it either.	Me nso menyɛ bɔne saa wɔ ho.
We had common interests.	Ná yɛwɔ nneɛma a yɛn nyinaa ani gye ho.
I find it interesting	Mihu sɛ ɛyɛ anigye
None of us have that.	Yɛn mu biara nni hɔ a ɔwɔ saa.
It’s expensive.	Ɛyɛ nea ne bo yɛ den.
Throughout the year.	Afe mũ no nyinaa.
I couldn’t understand how that was	Ná mintumi nte sɛnea na ɛte saa no ase
He was there himself, working.	Ná ɔno ankasa wɔ hɔ, na na ɔreyɛ adwuma.
You are very strong.	Wo ho yɛ den yiye.
What he did then, he’s doing again, now.	Nea ɔyɛɛ saa bere no, ɔreyɛ bio, seesei.
I heard about it this morning	Metee ho asɛm anɔpa yi
I have a good plan going	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe pa a ɛrekɔ so
Alright.	Ɛyɛ.
And in yours, too.	Na wo de nso mu.
He’s worried about something.	Ɔhaw biribi wɔ biribi ho.
He wants to do that.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I can’t go to him	Mintumi nkɔ ne nkyɛn
I intend to do it now.	Mewɔ adwene sɛ mɛyɛ no seesei.
I quickly made my way downstairs	Meyɛɛ me kwan kɔɔ fam ntɛmntɛm
I think that’s a good thing.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ ade pa.
And yet, it has to be a movie.	Na nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ sini.
No one lives here.	Onipa biara nte ha.
His mother was right.	Ná ne maame asɛm no yɛ nokware.
I saw those things happening	Mihuu sɛ saa nneɛma no rekɔ so
Thrive !.	Kɔ so !.
I had to work on myself and be someone	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ me ho adwuma na meyɛ obi
Therein lies the problem.	Ɛno mu na ɔhaw no da.
I was a street kid.	Ná meyɛ abofra a meyɛ abɔnten so abofra.
I should have thought about it	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho
However, there are some things now.	Nanso, nneɛma ahorow bi wɔ hɔ mprempren.
But you need to know the truth.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu nokware no.
I was a terrible person	Ná meyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hu
That’s only half the problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no fã pɛ.
Or maybe he’s in the house.	Anaasɛ ebia ɔwɔ fie hɔ.
That will come with time though.	Ɛno bɛba bere a bere kɔ so no nanso.
I'm with you.	Me ne wo.
Such a terrible thing.	Ade a ɛyɛ hu a ɛte saa.
I have a lot of things to get on with	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so
I could use someone like you on my team	Metumi de obi te sɛ wo adi dwuma wɔ me kuw no mu
I made my way in that direction	Meyɛɛ me kwan kɔɔ saa kwan no so
But you have to do it immediately afterwards.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no ntɛm ara wɔ ɛno akyi.
Clearly, something else is the problem.	Ɛda adi sɛ biribi foforo ne ɔhaw no.
I wish you both much happiness and joy	Mepɛ mo baanu nyinaa anigye ne anigye kɛse
A child that no one else can hear	Abofra a obi foforo biara ntumi nte
A very beautiful face.	Anim a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
We can’t control what anyone says.	Yɛrentumi nni nea obiara ka so.
And it’s not a bad thing.	Na ɛnyɛ asɛm bɔne.
I think there is more to this story	Misusuw sɛ pii wɔ saa asɛm yi mu
The door closed behind them.	Ɔpon no too mu wɔ wɔn akyi.
It can still happen to me.	Ɛda so ara tumi to me.
You have to come back to the school with us.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne yɛn san ba sukuu no mu.
I hope it’s not because of me	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛnyɛ me nti na ɛte saa
He thinks he’s a strong man.	Osusuw sɛ ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ den.
I must be getting worse	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ me ho reyɛ den kɛse
I like that too.	M’ani gye saa nso ho.
I heard you.	Metee wo.
His plans anyway.	Ne nhyehyɛe ahorow no ɔkwan biara so.
I was like a normal boy	Na me te sɛ abarimaa a ɔte ase
First, you do something for you.	Nea edi kan no, woyɛ biribi ma wo.
So let it be so.	Enti ma ɛnyɛ saa.
I leaned into his touch	Mede me ho too ne nsa a ɔde kaa no no mu
I didn’t know what had hit me	Ná minnim nea abɔ me
I have an idea you might like.	Mewɔ adwene bi a ebia w’ani begye ho.
I knew the girl who did it	Ná minim abeawa a ɔyɛɛ saa no
I have the same problem	Mewɔ ɔhaw koro no ara
That is the most likely scenario.	Ɛno ne tebea a ɛda adi kɛse.
Imagine what this would have been like.	Susuw sɛnea anka eyi bɛyɛ no ho hwɛ.
I feel like my feet are off the ground	Mete nka sɛ me nan so fi fam
But we might do the same thing again.	Nanso ebia yɛbɛyɛ ade koro no ara bio.
Deal with it as it is.	Di ho dwuma sɛnea ɛte.
I didn’t really need to hear this	Ná enhia sɛ mete eyi ankasa
But only if you hang out with me.	Nanso sɛ wo ne me bɔ nkutoo a.
I should have seen it sooner	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no ntɛm ara
It was everything to him.	Ná ɛyɛ biribiara ma no.
I think there might be someone else	Misusuw sɛ ebia obi foforo wɔ hɔ
I didn’t know for how long	Ná minnim bere tenten ahe
I wanted to do that so badly	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa denneennen
Maybe it was hope.	Ebia na ɛyɛ anidaso.
It’s all me.	Ne nyinaa yɛ me.
I have to do two jobs.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nnwuma abien.
And that’s how it was supposed to be.	Na saa na na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
A few hands slap the front of our car.	Nsa kakraa bi bɔ yɛn kar no anim.
Everyone is perfect in their own way.	Obiara yɛ pɛ wɔ ne kwan so.
It’s always an absolute surprise.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa bere nyinaa.
The words remained.	Nsɛm no kɔɔ so traa hɔ.
I sleep well every night	Meda yiye anadwo biara
I couldn’t do this anymore	Na mintumi nyɛ eyi bio
He could tell her anything and he did.	Ná obetumi aka biribiara akyerɛ no na ɔyɛɛ saa.
Eventually, this situation makes him stronger.	Awiei koraa no, tebea yi ma ne ho yɛ den.
I love people and I love being with people.	M’ani gye nnipa ho na m’ani gye ho sɛ me ne nkurɔfo bɛbɔ.
He was a bad guy.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa bɔne.
I’m not so excited today.	M’ani nnye ho kɛse nnɛ.
However, I obviously don’t.	Nanso, ɛda adi sɛ menyɛ saa.
I can see everybody, you know	Metumi hu obiara, wunim
He was worried about something but didn't want to talk about it.	Ɔhaw biribi wɔ biribi ho nanso na ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔka ho asɛm.
I didn’t know at all	Ná minnim koraa
There was more to the story.	Ná pii wɔ asɛm no mu.
He is happy.	Ɔwɔ anigye.
It is not their own nature.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn ankasa su.
You’ve done it right.	Woayɛ no yiye.
I immediately put myself in it.	Mede me ho too mu ntɛm ara.
Plan your route and play as you please.	Yɛ wo kwan ho nhyehyɛe na di agoru sɛnea wopɛ.
I was sitting on my bed	Ná mete me mpa so
They are really happy.	Wɔn ani agye ankasa.
I think that’s a good thing	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ ade pa
It’s bad news, you know.	Ɛyɛ asɛm bɔne, wunim.
Look at the time.	Hwɛ bere no mu.
It was always wet around this time of year.	Ná ɛyɛ nsu bere nyinaa bɛyɛ afe no mu bere yi mu.
And that’s what’s perfect.	Na ɛno ne nea ɛyɛ pɛ.
I don’t know what that was	Minnim nea na ɛno yɛ
I didn’t even think it was him.	Na minsusuw mpo sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno.
I put the gun in your father's picture	Mede tuo no hyɛɛ wo papa mfonini no mu
Which was amazing.	Nea na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Sleep just got a lot harder.	Nna mu yɛɛ den kɛse ara kwa.
It’s a squirrel.	Ɛyɛ ɔkraman.
I would do anything to get rid of it	Anka mɛyɛ biribiara de agye afi hɔ
For a man it is quite simple.	Wɔ ɔbarima fam no ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
He had nothing to do with her.	Ná ɔne no nni hwee yɛ.
I would have loved it more	Anka m’ani begye ho kɛse
He is in a completely different role.	Ɔwɔ dwuma foforo mu koraa.
That’s not why people want them anyway.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno nti na nkurɔfo pɛ wɔn ɔkwan biara so no.
This would come to an end.	Ná eyi bɛba awiei.
I doubt this is possible.	Migye kyim sɛ eyi betumi ayɛ yiye.
Something past that one can reach.	Biribi a atwam a obi betumi adu ho.
More on this here.	Eyi ho nsɛm pii wɔ ha.
I slipped my hands around her.	Mede me nsa kaa ne ho.
I wanted to talk to this man	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne ɔbarima yi kasa
Part of it, anyway	Ne fã bi, sɛnea ɛte biara
The past means nothing.	Nea atwam no nkyerɛ hwee.
I will definitely implement that idea.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mede saa adwene no bedi dwuma.
And that’s that for his mother.	Na ɛno ne saa ma ne maame.
I want to use those.	Mepɛ sɛ mede saa nneɛma no di dwuma.
I feel like you know this.	Mete nka sɛ wunim eyi.
And it’s the same thing.	Na ɛte saa ara.
I didn’t really know anyone else that well	Ná minnim obi foforo biara yiye saa ankasa
I just felt like it was all over	Metee nka ara sɛ ne nyinaa aba awiei
That’s an idea.	Ɛno yɛ adwene bi.
Maybe, maybe not.	Ebia, ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
And sure enough, it is.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, ɛyɛ.
I felt the need to take care of him anyway	Metee nka sɛ ɛho hia sɛ mehwɛ ne ho ɔkwan biara so
But only testing.	Nanso sɔhwɛ nkutoo.
No one needed to know.	Ná enhia sɛ obiara hu.
I seem to have done all right too	Ɛte sɛ nea me nso mayɛ ne nyinaa yiye
And he had to do that.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
I should be fine though	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ yiye nanso
I glanced around the room quickly	Mede m’ani hwɛɛ dan no mu ntɛmntɛm
I hope you know what you're getting yourself into	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wunim nea wode wo ho ahyɛ mu
Why should I	Dɛn nti na ɛsɛ sɛ .
Don’t let anyone see you.	Mma obiara nhu wo.
It might even work.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ adwuma mpo.
I had no words to describe him	Ná minni nsɛm a mede bɛka ne ho asɛm
I loved being with him	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ me ne no bɛbɔ
You can’t see anything.	Worentumi nhu hwee.
To touch you with their hands.	Sɛ wɔde wɔn nsa bɛka wo.
I have a meeting tomorrow morning	Mewɔ nhyiam ɔkyena anɔpa
But he was there.	Nanso na ɔwɔ hɔ.
And I don’t speak.	Na menyɛ kasa.
I wouldn’t have known you existed	Anka minnim sɛ wowɔ hɔ
I think he used it all on me	Misusuw sɛ ɔde ne nyinaa dii dwuma wɔ me so
Everyone was here.	Ná obiara wɔ ha.
There are usually only three options.	Mpɛn pii no, nneɛma abiɛsa pɛ na ɛwɔ hɔ.
It was our pleasure.	Ná ɛyɛ yɛn anigye.
I really have to thank you for that	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda mo ase wɔ saa asɛm no ho ankasa
He didn’t have that option.	Ná onni saa kwan no.
This is your car to drive now.	Eyi ne wo kar a ɛsɛ sɛ woka mprempren.
I talk to everyone.	Me ne obiara kasa.
Everyone saw what happened.	Obiara huu nea esii no.
He's just a wonderful human being.	Ɔyɛ onipa a ɔyɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
I could almost feel him sitting next to me	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mete nka sɛ ɔte me nkyɛn
How terrible for him.	Hwɛ sɛnea ɛyɛ hu ma no.
And that’s what’s so scary about it.	Na ɛno ne nea ɛyɛ hu kɛse wɔ ho.
He wants you to know him.	Ɔpɛ sɛ wuhu no.
How good that I had done this.	Hwɛ sɛnea eye sɛ na mayɛ eyi.
Many people agree with you	Nnipa pii ne wo yɛ adwene
Keep their heads down.	Ma wɔn ti nkɔ fam.
I still can't let you out.	Meda so ara ntumi mma wo mfi adi.
I wanted to understand this.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mete eyi ase.
I didn’t know he could do something like that.	Ná minnim sɛ obetumi ayɛ biribi a ɛte saa.
New, new, new.	Sika, sika, sika.
How long that would remain true is another matter.	Bere tenten a na ɛno bɛkɔ so ayɛ nokware no yɛ asɛm foforo.
And many times over.	Na mpɛn pii nso.
He loved to talk about books.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛka nhoma ahorow ho asɛm.
That is not the case in the instant case.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛte wɔ asɛm a ɛwɔ hɔ ntɛm ara no mu.
I wanted to stay busy	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so di adagyew
I don’t have time to do that.	Minni bere a mede bɛyɛ saa.
I want to talk to him, face to face	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa, anim ne anim
I touch something soft	Mede me nsa ka biribi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw
You are with him in a way.	Wo ne no wɔ ɔkwan bi so.
And maybe the shoe was on the other foot.	Na ebia na mpaboa no wɔ nan foforo no so.
It’s not just for food either.	Ɛnyɛ aduan nkutoo nti nso.
I can only look at the same thing	Metumi hwɛ ade koro no ara nkutoo
The shape of his head, his feet.	Sɛnea ne ti te, ne nan.
Go to your bedroom.	Kɔ wo mpa so.
I want my house.	Mepɛ me fie.
I don’t think there’s anything wrong with me.	Minsusuw sɛ mfomso biara wɔ me ho.
He must regret that that is over.	Ɛsɛ sɛ odi ho yaw sɛ ɛno aba awiei.
So most of them.	Enti wɔn mu dodow no ara.
I'm right there with you, man.	Me ne wo wɔ hɔ ara, ɔbarima.
You used to love school.	Kan no na w’ani gye sukuu ho.
But we have a job to do.	Nanso yɛwɔ adwuma bi a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
Maybe next time but it didn't really matter.	Ebia bere foforo nanso na enhia ankasa.
I couldn’t get to him	Na mintumi nkɔ ne nkyɛn
This way, this way.	Saa kwan yi so, saa kwan yi so.
The water was not that rough.	Ná nsu no mu nyɛ den saa.
I’m so much happier now	M’ani agye kɛse mprempren
I just want to know what he looks like	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea ɔte ara kwa
It had to be that way.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
He was big and strong.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse na ne ho yɛ den.
No one ever did my father but you.	Obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛɛ me papa da gye wo.
This is your inner power.	Eyi ne wo mu tumi.
All of this can happen in about a day	Eyi nyinaa betumi asi wɔ bɛyɛ da koro mu
I can’t even go that far.	Me ntumi mpo nkɔ akyiri saa.
The defense made no such claim.	Wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho gyee asɛm no mu no anka asɛm biara a ɛte saa.
However, you may not know what the other person wants.	Nanso, ebia wunnim nea onipa foforo no pɛ.
I don't need it.	Me ho nhia.
I can give you anything here	Metumi de biribiara ama wo wɔ ha
He had to tell her.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔka kyerɛ no.
You tell him, child.	Woka kyerɛ no, abofra.
We had a long drive.	Ná yɛwɔ kar tenten bi.
I couldn't imagine how he felt	Ná mintumi nsusuw sɛnea ɔte nka no ho
I had to be strong	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ den
I loved the attention	M’ani gyee adwene a wɔde sii so no ho
I slipped to the water	Mede me ho fii ase hwee ase wɔ nsu no ho
I wanted to know that.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu saa.
I put my hand over my eyes	Mede me nsa too m’ani so
The first is not currently in effect.	Nea edi kan no nni dwuma mprempren.
I'm so sorry, folks	Mepa wo kyɛw paa, nkurɔfo
I think he has a soft spot	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ baabi a ɛyɛ mmerɛw
I was a risk I should never have taken	Ná meyɛ asiane a ɛnsɛ sɛ mede me ho to mu da
I can’t be pretty.	Mintumi nyɛ fɛ.
That is their job.	Ɛno ne wɔn adwuma.
As the story stands now, it doesn’t seem that way.	Sɛnea asɛm no te mprempren no, ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ saa.
I can’t imagine what it’s like for you	Mintumi nsusuw sɛnea ɛte ma wo no ho
I have time on my hands	Mewɔ bere wɔ me nsa so
If you don’t want to, don’t tell me.	Sɛ wompɛ a, nka nkyerɛ me.
That if there is no object you are the object.	Sɛ sɛ ade biara nni hɔ a wo ne ade no.
I can’t assume I don’t know	Me ntumi mfa sɛ minnim
It’s too early.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo.
I think you’ve made it here	Misusuw sɛ woayɛ no wɔ ha
I feel all there is to feel	Mete nea ɛwɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ mete nka nyinaa nka
It wasn’t too bad for a weekend.	Ná ɛnyɛ bɔne dodo dapɛn awiei bi.
The man drove to the main street.	Ɔbarima no de kar kɔɔ abɔnten kɛse no so.
A girl who looked just like her	Abeawa bi a na ɔte sɛ ɔno ara pɛ
It used to be a big problem.	Kan no na ɛyɛ ɔhaw kɛse.
And you never need to get involved.	Na enhia sɛ wode wo ho hyɛ mu da.
It was a fun night.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye anadwo.
I know you want to work alone	Minim sɛ wopɛ sɛ wo nkutoo yɛ adwuma
He was not pretentious.	Ná ɔnyɛ ne ho sɛ ɔyɛ obi a ɔnyɛ hwee.
That’s what’s important.	Ɛno ne nea ɛho hia.
It doesn’t surprise me.	Ɛnyɛ me nwonwa.
Maybe I have a textbook with my name on it	Ebia mewɔ adesua nhoma bi a me din wɔ mu
I can’t pretend otherwise	Mintumi nyɛ me ho sɛ ɛnte saa
This is how most people handle their affairs.	Eyi ne sɛnea nnipa dodow no ara di wɔn nsɛm ho dwuma.
Your problems are our problems.	Wo haw ahorow no yɛ yɛn haw ahorow.
A few people came along	Nnipa kakraa bi baa hɔ
It was never part of the plan.	Ná ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe no fã da.
Clearly, that was not true.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛno nyɛ nokware.
But they might be interested.	Nanso ebia wɔn ani begye ho.
I'm about this issue.	Me fa saa asɛm yi ho.
At least acknowledge when there is a problem.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, gye tom bere a ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ no.
Something like that.	Biribi a ɛte saa.
I didn’t know the details	Ná minnim nsɛm no
I just like it for myself	M’ani gye ho ma me ho ara kwa
It must have been terrifying for you.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛyɛ hu ma wo.
It’s a little harder than it needed to be	Ɛyɛ den kakra sen sɛnea na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ
I can't understand the boy alone	Mintumi nte abarimaa no nkutoo ase
It’s a beautiful thing.	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
But you have to hand it to them.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wode hyɛ wɔn nsa.
I was in the first group	Ná mewɔ kuw a edi kan no mu
Everything goes so fast and easy.	Biribiara kɔ ntɛmntɛm na ɛnyɛ den saa.
That makes things easier for me then.	Ɛno ma nneɛma yɛ mmerɛw ma me saa bere no.
It’s quite simple.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa.
We need to do it now.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ no mprempren.
I don’t think they’re real.	Minsusuw sɛ wɔyɛ nnipa ankasa.
I used to think nothing of it.	Kan no na minsusuw ho hwee.
But more was to follow.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ pii di akyi.
He touched her hand.	Ɔde ne nsa kaa ne nsa.
Good is not good enough.	Papa nyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
I totally understand that.	Mete saa asɛm no ase koraa.
It has been an awesome few days for us too.	Ayɛ nna kakraa bi a ɛyɛ hu ama yɛn nso.
You work for a living.	Woyɛ adwuma de tra ase.
I can do nothing for them	Mintumi nyɛ hwee mma wɔn
I even know the man’s name.	Minim ɔbarima no din mpo.
Or at least it was.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, na ɛte saa.
I thought maybe so.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia ɛte saa.
Make the best of it.	Fa yɛ nea eye sen biara.
As most seasons end badly.	Sɛnea bere dodow no ara ba awiei bɔne no.
Just one more time.	Bere biako pɛ bio.
They just don’t have a lead.	Wɔn nni anim kɛkɛ.
I made my way through them to the front	Mede me kwan faa wɔn mu kɔɔ anim
I think of my mother	Misusuw me maame ho
The reason for this could be anything.	Nea enti a eyi te saa no betumi ayɛ nea ɛte biara.
And this doesn’t even go into the early years.	Na eyi mpo nkɔ mfe a edi kan no mu.
I look around the music room with interest	Mede anigye hwɛ nnwom dan no mu
It is good in some cases.	Ɛyɛ papa wɔ nsɛm bi mu.
I recover very quickly	Me ho yɛ den ntɛmntɛm paa
At his side.	Wɔ ne nkyɛn.
Too much time.	Bere pii dodo.
I want to know more.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu pii.
A moment longer and he would be hers	Bere tiaa bi bio na na ɔbɛyɛ ne de
At least there is for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛwɔ hɔ ma me.
Might as well be out there	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ mewɔ abɔnten saa ara
That has worked out really well for us as well.	Ɛno ayɛ adwuma yiye ankasa ama yɛn nso.
In many cases, you have to do the work.	Wɔ nsɛm pii mu no, ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma no.
That was you.	Ná ɛno ne wo.
There were a lot of people on this one	Ná nnipa pii wɔ eyi so
I knew I was wrong	Ná minim sɛ na m’adwene ayɛ mfomso
A better shot than that.	Tuo a eye sen saa.
A great idea.	Adwene kɛse bi.
I want to do that, though.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa, nanso.
And I was never very good at that either	Na me nso na me ho akokwaw kɛse wɔ saa asɛm no mu da
At least they were.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na wɔyɛ saa.
I didn't even know he had it	Ná minnim mpo sɛ ɔwɔ bi
Best decision my wife and I have ever made.	Gyinae a eye sen biara a me ne me yere asi pɛn.
And I can’t even tell you what’s inside	Na mintumi nka nea ɛwɔ mu no mpo nkyerɛ wo
I want to join your team from now on	Mepɛ sɛ meka mo kuw no ho fi mprempren rekɔ
It’s just beautiful	Ɛyɛ fɛ ara kwa
I had no real desire	Ná minni ɔpɛ ankasa biara
That’s wonderful, you think.	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa, wususuw.
I think that’s the best.	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne nea eye sen biara.
I just wanted to prove myself	Ná mepɛ sɛ meda me ho adi kɛkɛ
I think you might do that.	Misusuw sɛ ebia wobɛyɛ saa.
It’s because of his opinion.	Ɛyɛ n’adwene nti.
There were not many people left.	Ná nnipa pii nni hɔ a aka.
I also worked on a painting	Me nso meyɛɛ mfonini bi ho adwuma
I am the only hand left	Me nkutoo na meyɛ nsa a aka
Or maybe it would have.	Anaasɛ ebia anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
They are the best.	Wɔn na wɔyɛ papa sen biara.
I know it’s hard.	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ den.
Neither does anyone else.	Saa ara na obi foforo biara nso nyɛ saa.
It was as if a new force were coming.	Na ɛte sɛ nea tumi foforo bi de ba.
This story is going on for a long time.	Saa asɛm yi rekɔ so akyɛ.
I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.	Mepa wo kyɛw sɛ ɛno bɛma w’ani agye a.
But right now, that’s beside the point.	Nanso mprempren yi ara, ɛno wɔ asɛm no nkyɛn.
I put his in mine	Mede ne de no too me de no mu
I had to look good	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ me ho yɛ fɛ
I had to organize things	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nneɛma ho nhyehyɛe
I saw many of them.	Mihuu wɔn mu pii.
I was doing pretty well, thank you	Na mereyɛ fɛ yiye, meda wo ase
I was just a kid at the time	Saa bere no na meyɛ abofra ara kwa
Too late now, anyway.	Akyiri dodo mprempren, ɔkwan biara so.
He didn't want to hear it.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔte.
Everyone is on it.	Obiara wɔ so.
You do not need to add one system.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wode nhyehyɛe biako ka ho.
Maybe it was his.	Ebia na ɛyɛ ne de.
Maybe a little better.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ papa kakra.
I think some of my problems are psychological	Misusuw sɛ me haw no bi fa adwene mu de
I knew it would be interesting	Ná minim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ anigye
I couldn’t help but like it	Na mintumi nyɛ hwee sɛ m’ani begye ho
I hope today goes easier for you	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ nnɛ bɛkɔ mmerɛw ama wo
However, it is not mine.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ me de.
One hears a lot about its amazing variety.	Obi te ne ahorow ahorow a ɛyɛ nwonwa no ho nsɛm pii.
He was indeed very popular.	Ná nkurɔfo ani gye ne ho kɛse ampa.
I hadn’t thought about it	Ná minsusuw ho
With this, you can solve the problem.	Sɛ wode eyi di dwuma a, wubetumi adi ɔhaw no ho dwuma.
He had done it.	Ná wayɛ no.
They have a long throw.	Wɔn wɔ tenten bi a wɔde to.
One night alone is not bad	Anadwo biako nkutoo nyɛ bɔne
I wish more people would do this.	Me yam a anka nnipa pii bɛyɛ eyi.
I asked him to do it for me	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɔnyɛ mma me
I couldn't believe how strong he was	Ná mintumi nnye sɛnea na ne ho yɛ den no nni
That would include dad.	Ná papa bɛka ɛno ho.
Your part introduced us to us.	Wo fã na wode yɛn kyerɛɛ yɛn.
In good condition.	Wɔ tebea pa mu.
They both wanted them.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa pɛ wɔn.
But this was not possible.	Nanso na eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
Any.	Biara.
I need to understand what is going on	Ɛsɛ sɛ mete nea ɛrekɔ so no ase
There are three things to consider.	Nneɛma abiɛsa na ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho.
And they’re very real.	Na wɔyɛ ankasa yiye.
Not on me, mind.	Ɛnyɛ me so, adwene.
I can be amazingly committed	Metumi de me ho ama ma ayɛ nwonwa
I have to live with myself	Ɛsɛ sɛ me ne me ho tra
For them, it was.	Wɔn fam no, na ɛte saa.
A very beautiful approach.	Ɔkwan a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I know how she doesn’t like him on her.	Minim sɛnea n’ani nnye ne ho wɔ ne so.
In my opinion it's because of our size.	Wɔ m'adwene mu no ɛyɛ yɛn kɛse nti.
It has to be somewhere in the house.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛwɔ fie hɔ baabi.
I owe a lot of rent, man	Mede dan ka kɛse, ɔbarima
Lots of power for them.	Tumi pii ma wɔn.
I was never good enough	Ná menyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ da
You don’t have to be weak.	Ɛho nhia sɛ woyɛ mmerɛw.
I wish it wasn’t	Me yam a anka ɛnte saa
Not in time.	Ɛnyɛ bere mu.
He wanted to do it himself.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa yɛ saa.
That was clear a long time ago.	Ná ɛno mu da hɔ bere tenten a atwam ni.
He knew the man.	Ná onim ɔbarima no.
That’s the problem.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
Maybe it was just enough for both of us.	Ebia na ɛdɔɔso ara kwa ma yɛn baanu nyinaa.
Yes, this is a good job.	Ampa, eyi yɛ adwuma pa.
And that’s what we’re going to do today.	Na ɛno ne nea yɛbɛyɛ nnɛ.
I really want to see you so bad	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wo bɔne saa ampa
I was not a sleepy girl	Ná menyɛ abeawa a na meda hɔ
Probably for the best.	Ebia nea eye sen biara no nti.
He was interested in it.	Ná n’ani gye ho.
I want to know what is going on.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so.
But, maybe that’s just me.	Nanso, ebia ɛno yɛ me ara kwa.
I'm with you there.	Me ne wo wɔ hɔ.
I thought it would be good.	Misusuwii sɛ ɛbɛyɛ papa.
I hadn’t thought of it that way.	Ná minsusuw ho saa.
I thought it was pretty cool	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ yiye
But this one doesn’t look like it’s going to be easy.	Nanso eyi de, ɛnyɛ te sɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
We conclude that it is not.	Yɛde ba awiei sɛ ɛnyɛ saa.
I had to agree with him	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no yɛ adwene
It works very well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye paa.
Pictures were just words.	Ná mfonini ahorow yɛ nsɛm a wɔka ara kwa.
I can’t drive that car	Mintumi nka saa kar no
I felt it was still there, and so did he.	Metee nka sɛ ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ, na ɔno nso tee nka.
I think we’ll be fine	Misusuw sɛ yɛn ho bɛtɔ yɛn
I guess that’s the way of these things	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne saa nneɛma yi kwan
I like the idea of ​​that.	M’ani gye adwene a ɛwɔ saa asɛm no ho no ho.
He had such a good day.	Ɔno nso nyaa da pa a ɛte saa.
I gave you something better	Mede biribi a eye sen saa maa wo
No one can take it.	Obiara ntumi nnye.
I told you we would be friends	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ yɛbɛyɛ nnamfo
There are many things.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ.
However, this option does not seem to be on my system.	Nanso, ɛte sɛ nea saa ɔkwan yi nni me nhyehyɛe no so.
Again, there is nothing wrong with that.	Bio nso, mfomso biara nni saa asɛm no ho.
I’m also interested in it.	M’ani gye ho nso.
I couldn’t recognize the language	Ná mintumi nhu kasa no
Live each day like it’s the first.	Tra ase da biara te sɛ nea edi kan.
He knew her well.	Ná onim no yiye.
That number seemed to work well.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea saa dodow no yɛ adwuma yiye.
I can’t tell you much	Mintumi nka pii nkyerɛ wo
Hours a day.	Nnɔnhwerew da biara.
None of those events happened.	Saa nsɛm no mu biara amma.
Perhaps he felt the same way.	Ebia ɔno nso tee nka saa ara.
You know it’s me.	Wunim sɛ ɛyɛ me.
My mom, my mom was great.	Me maame, na me maame yɛ kɛse.
I'm going here.	Mekɔ ha.
Maybe you can make him more interested	Ebia wubetumi ama n’ani agye ho yiye
And he wasn’t the only one.	Na ɛnyɛ ɔno nkutoo na na ɔwɔ hɔ.
Or, at least, me.	Anaasɛ, anyɛ yiye koraa no, me.
This is a difficult task.	Eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den.
Everyone is there.	Obiara wɔ hɔ.
Someone is doing it.	Obi na ɔreyɛ.
He's like that, give him a dog and he's happy.	Ɔte saa, ma no kraman na n'ani gye.
It was like any other day.	Ná ɛte sɛ da foforo biara.
I knew he had plenty.	Ná minim sɛ ɔwɔ pii.
I think he did it just to get my attention	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a m’adwene besi so kɛkɛ
He didn't want to do that.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
At least we hope so.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
I was sitting right here, understanding	Na mete ha yi ara, na mete ase
I want to understand why	Mepɛ sɛ mete nea enti a ɛte saa no ase
It’s such a pleasure.	Ɛyɛ anigye a ɛte saa.
I can work all hours	Metumi ayɛ adwuma nnɔnhwerew biara
I wonder what time dinner is	Misusuw bere a anwummere aduan yɛ ho
You don’t have to do this.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ woyɛ eyi.
I think it works well.	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
There was trouble on the highway behind them.	Ná ɔhaw wɔ ɔkwan kɛse a ɛwɔ wɔn akyi no so.
It’s a very nice car.	Ɛyɛ kar a ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
I had no choice but to head home	Ná minni biribi foforo biara a mɛyɛ gye sɛ mede m’ani kyerɛ fie
I love everything about him	M’ani gye ne ho biribiara ho
I love being with them here	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛka wɔn ho wɔ ha
The point is whether we will do good or bad.	Asɛm no ne sɛ ebia yɛbɛyɛ papa anaa bɔne.
This is not about policing yourself.	Eyi nyɛ polisifo a wobɛyɛ wo ho.
But they shouldn’t be.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
My wife, she was in danger.	Me yere, na ɔwɔ asiane mu.
What can I do for this? 	Dɛn na metumi ayɛ ama eyi?
I was in charge of the evening classes	Ná mehwɛ anwummere adesua ahorow no so
I took a risk.	Mede me ho too asiane mu.
I'm looking at him.	Mehwɛ no.
But it is very cold here.	Nanso awɔw wom kɛse wɔ ha.
There was never a time he wasn’t there for me.	Bere biara nni hɔ a na onni hɔ mma me.
The same was true here.	Saa ara na na ɛte wɔ ha.
It’s hard to put into words.	Ɛyɛ den sɛ wɔde nsɛm bɛka ho asɛm.
Many people were shocked	Nnipa pii ho dwiriw wɔn
I don’t want to anymore.	Mempɛ bio.
It’s just terrible.	Ɛyɛ hu ara kwa.
This is obviously for the best.	Ɛda adi sɛ eyi yɛ nea eye sen biara.
I probably always will	Ebia mɛyɛ saa bere nyinaa
I think some of your people may have gotten out	Misusuw sɛ ebia wo nkurɔfo no bi fii adi
I can’t take it that way	Mintumi mfa no saa kwan no so
And this is really true.	Na eyi yɛ nokware ankasa.
Or maybe it is.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛte saa.
I needed to feel his touch	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mete nka sɛ ɔde ne nsa ka me
I want one thing and one thing only	Mepɛ ade biako ne ade biako pɛ
He didn't seem to recognize her anymore.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea onnim no bio.
I believe it.	Migye di.
He brought me here.	Ɔde me baa ha.
Those days are long gone.	Saa nna no atwam akyɛ.
It still needs the shoes too.	Ɛda so ara hia mpaboa a wɔde yɛ no nso.
I don’t want to do these things	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa nneɛma yi
It’s not just his friends.	Ɛnyɛ ne nnamfo nkutoo na wɔyɛ.
I was served amazing wines all night	Wɔde nsa a ɛyɛ nwonwa maa me anadwo mũ no nyinaa
He made one.	Ɔyɛɛ biako.
And, in a way, it actually works.	Na, ɔkwan bi so no, ɛyɛ adwuma ankasa.
That was absolutely amazing	Ná ɛno yɛ nwonwa koraa
Quite a few last year.	Kakraa bi koraa wɔ afe a etwaam no mu.
He stepped aside.	Ɔde ne ho too nkyɛn.
He doesn’t know how good he is.	Onnim sɛnea ɔyɛ papa.
But all good things must come to an end.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ nneɛma pa nyinaa ba awiei.
I believed this was the end for us	Ná migye di sɛ eyi ne awiei no ma yɛn
What ultimately matters is the content of the plan.	Nea ɛho hia awiei koraa ne nhyehyɛe no mu nsɛm.
At least not in this case.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ asɛm yi mu.
But he wasn’t there, not by a long shot.	Nanso na onni hɔ, ɛnyɛ tuo tenten bi so.
All you think about is work.	Nea wususuw ho ara ne adwuma.
I never wanted that to be a part of me	Na mempɛ da sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ me fã
I just do that all the time.	Meyɛ saa ara kwa bere nyinaa.
I don't necessarily have to.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia sɛ meyɛ saa.
I can’t leave anyway	Mintumi mfi hɔ ɔkwan biara so
And that surprised them.	Na ɛno maa wɔn ho dwiriw wɔn.
I couldn’t control my first impulse.	Ná mintumi nni m’adwene a edi kan no so.
He didn't know what to do with the letter.	Ná onnim nea ɔbɛyɛ wɔ krataa no ho.
I don’t think many people realize this.	Minsusuw sɛ nnipa pii hu eyi.
My head was stunned.	Me ti yɛɛ me nwonwa.
Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Ebia ɛnyɛ hwee.
He knocks on the window.	Ɔbɔ mfɛnsere no mu.
You have to make plays.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ agoru ahorow.
I finally understood.	Awiei koraa no, metee ase.
I lived with my mother.	Ná me ne me maame te.
I had forgotten what it felt like	Ná me werɛ afi sɛnea na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte no
We can let it heat up.	Yebetumi ama ayɛ hyew.
Check it out and leave.	Hwɛ mu na fi hɔ kɔ.
It was totally unexpected	Ná ɛnyɛ nea mehwɛ kwan koraa
I just made up those names	Meyɛɛ saa din ahorow no ara kwa
I think it’s beautiful	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ
We can do the same thing here.	Yebetumi ayɛ saa ara wɔ ha.
That’s just part of the job.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma no fã bi kɛkɛ.
He was a terrible man.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa a ne ho yɛ hu.
I couldn’t feel things	Ná mintumi nte nneɛma nka
He had a job for me.	Ná ɔwɔ adwuma bi ma me.
But very, very quickly.	Nanso ntɛmntɛm paa, paa.
I feel such different things in you	Mete nneɛma ahorow a ɛte saa nka wɔ wo mu
This song is for you.	Dwom yi yɛ ma wo.
But the work is not finished.	Nanso adwuma no mma awiei.
I know, that’s a thing you use, too	Minim, ɛno yɛ ade a wode di dwuma, nso
There is a job to be done.	Adwuma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
It was new at the time.	Ná ɛyɛ foforo saa bere no.
The same is true of us.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ yɛn fam.
I am always a happy person	Meyɛ obi a n’ani gye bere nyinaa
The three hours seemed to be over in an instant.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa no aba awiei wɔ bere tiaa bi mu.
I couldn’t win.	Na mintumi nni nkonim.
I really didn’t know what to think just yet	Ankasa na minnim nea ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho mprempren ara
I can't say anything else at this point	Mintumi nka biribi foforo biara wɔ saa bere yi mu
Hard to hard and soft to soft.	Ɛyɛ den kosi sɛ ɛyɛ den na ɛyɛ mmerɛw kosi sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
He took me home.	Ɔde me kɔɔ fie.
I am stronger than he is	Me ho yɛ den sen no
No one knows his real name.	Obiara nnim ne din ankasa.
This is all true.	Eyi nyinaa yɛ nokware.
The size of my son.	Me ba no kɛse.
Maybe he could help her.	Ebia na obetumi aboa no.
Those details are still pending.	Saa nsɛm no da so ara wɔ asɛm no mu.
I am doing that now.	Meyɛ saa mprempren.
They were perfect in that regard.	Ná wɔyɛ pɛ wɔ saa asɛm no mu.
A little here, a little there.	Kakraa bi wɔ ha, kakra wɔ hɔ.
I think it’s important.	Misusuw sɛ ɛho hia.
Your children are doing very well.	Wo mma reyɛ papa paa.
I didn’t do it for the money	Ɛnyɛ sika no nti na meyɛɛ saa
I showed it to him.	Mede kyerɛɛ no.
But you say it’s a bad thing.	Nanso woka sɛ ɛyɛ ade bɔne.
However, I understand	Nanso, mete ase
The problem is that no one uses those.	Ɔhaw no ne sɛ obiara mfa saa nneɛma no nni dwuma.
I think the clothes are beautiful	Misusuw sɛ ntade no yɛ fɛ
I know how well that would have gone	Minim sɛnea anka ɛno bɛkɔ yiye
It was actually a lot of fun.	Na ɛyɛ anigye pii ankasa.
Or even a child.	Anaasɛ abofra mpo.
It was very expensive.	Na ne bo yɛ den yiye.
They are very beautiful.	Wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
They both knew there was nothing in the pictures.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa nim sɛ biribiara nni mfonini ahorow no mu.
So planning is important.	Enti nhyehyɛe ho hia.
I want to know everything about you	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wo ho biribiara
It must be about the same length.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ne tenten te.
Even if it succeeds in the first place.	Sɛ ɛyɛ yiye mpo sɛ wɔ nea edi kan no mu a.
I am headed there now	Mede m’ani asi hɔ mprempren
We can pass you by.	Yebetumi atwam wo.
Finally a girl.	Awiei koraa no abeawa bi.
You really like him.	W’ani gye ne ho ankasa.
His wife often did too.	Ná ne yere nso taa yɛ.
I’d love to go home too	M’ani begye ho sɛ me nso mekɔ fie
And you do it very well.	Na woyɛ no yiye paa.
That’s what it’s full of.	Ɛno ne nea ɛyɛ ma.
I see you have a problem	Mihu sɛ wowɔ ɔhaw bi
Look at the picture.	Hwɛ mfonini no.
I told him that he had no right.	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ onni hokwan biara.
I think that’s a true story	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nokware
Can you believe it.	So wubetumi agye adi.
Just look hard and tell me everything.	Hwɛ denneennen kɛkɛ na ka biribiara kyerɛ me.
Interesting viewing.	Anigye a wɔde hwɛ ade.
There was no excitement.	Ná anigye biara nni hɔ.
I was lying on a hard surface	Ná meda baabi a ɛyɛ den so
I think he was doing something completely different	Misusuw sɛ na ɔreyɛ biribi foforo koraa
There is something else.	Biribi foforo wɔ hɔ.
Look and see.	Hwɛ na hwɛ.
A great idea can only take you so far	Adwene kɛse bi betumi de wo akɔ akyiri saa nkutoo
Something strange was going on with the girl.	Ná biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa rekɔ so wɔ abeawa no ho.
I just know his name	Minim ne din ara kwa
The prices these two charge, are too high.	Nneɛma bo a saa baanu yi gye no, yɛ kɛse dodo.
I hope you all had a great weekend	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo nyinaa nyaa dapɛn awiei kɛse
Try harder next time.	Bɔ mmɔden kɛse bere foforo.
Who would say such a thing.	Hena na ɔbɛka asɛm a ɛte saa.
This seems to be the case.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi te saa.
I didn’t have time for this tonight	Na minni bere mma eyi anadwo yi
But no one knows.	Nanso obiara nnim.
That was my immediate thought.	Ɛno ne m’adwene ntɛm ara.
He would be good to work for.	Ɔbɛyɛ papa sɛ ɔbɛyɛ adwuma ama.
I really hope you enjoy it	Mewɔ anidaso ankasa sɛ w’ani begye ho
I love it in almost every way.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ m’ani gye ho wɔ biribiara mu.
Maybe it was the case.	Ebia na ɛte saa.
Something has to come out of this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi fi eyi mu ba.
Sorry but it’s the truth.	Pa kyɛw nanso ɛyɛ nokware no.
It was hot to say the least.	Ná ɛyɛ hyew sɛ obi bɛka.
It’s okay to make mistakes.	Ɛnyɛ hwee sɛ wobɛyɛ mfomso.
We are better than this, folks.	Yɛyɛ papa sen eyi, nkurɔfo.
I also want some things	Mepɛ nneɛma bi nso
I thought everything would be fine	Misusuwii sɛ biribiara bɛyɛ yiye
Tell him that for me.	Ka kyerɛ no saa ma me.
Being the real person is what matters.	Onipa ankasa a obi bɛyɛ no ne nea ɛho hia.
I saw something.	Mihuu biribi.
Clearly, the same is not true of him.	Ɛda adi sɛ saa ara na ɛnte saa wɔ ne fam.
I see it in the pictures when he was younger.	Mihu wɔ mfonini ahorow no mu bere a na ɔyɛ abofra no.
It doesn’t matter.	Ɛho nhia biara.
I like them too, but your father was right	M’ani gye wɔn nso ho, nanso na wo papa asɛm no yɛ nokware
I thought, nothing really	Misusuwii sɛ, biribiara nni hɔ ankasa
He knew her well.	Ná onim no yiye.
Well, dad, dad.	Eye, papa, papa.
I wrap my arms around her so tightly	Mede me nsa bɔ ne ho denneennen saa
That was his only hope.	Ná ɛno nkutoo ne anidaso a ɔwɔ.
This is going to happen.	Eyi rekɔ so.
And the song isn’t too bad either.	Na dwom no nso nyɛ bɔne dodo.
I wasn’t doing well.	Ná menyɛ yiye.
A day in, a night out, a day out	Da koro mu, da anadwo, da koro akɔ abɔnten
Keep going, he told himself.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ, kɔ so yɛ saa.
The other two followed.	Nnipa baanu a aka no dii akyi.
I want to talk more about that house	Mepɛ sɛ meka saa ofie no ho nsɛm pii
Here is my pain.	Me yaw no ni.
I knew you were with someone	Na minim sɛ wo ne obi a, wo ne obi
I see it really well	Mihu no yiye ankasa
I hope it all went well	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ne nyinaa akɔ so yiye
But it has done so.	Nanso ayɛ saa.
I wonder why he does this	Misusuw nea enti a ɔyɛ eyi ho
Maybe it wasn’t.	Ebia na ɛnte saa.
I don’t want to talk about it on the phone.	Mempɛ sɛ meka ho asɛm wɔ telefon so.
He was amazing looking	Ná ne ho yɛ nwonwa
But you know, that says a lot about you.	Nanso wunim, ɛno ka wo ho nsɛm pii.
I thought you were something else	Misusuwii sɛ woyɛ biribi foforo
But this does not seem to be the case.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea eyi nte saa.
I didn’t know you would do this now	Na minnim sɛ wobɛyɛ eyi mprempren
He had never done that before.	Ná ɔnyɛ saa da.
But I had to do that	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa
They run, too.	Wɔn nso tu mmirika.
You need to see someone.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wuhu obi.
I understood that	Metee saa asɛm no ase
I feel the same way about things	Saa ara na mete nka wɔ nneɛma ho
At least I think so	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, misusuw sɛ ɛte saa
What you said.	Nea wokae no.
I love you so much	Mepɛ wo paa
This has been going on for a long time.	Eyi akɔ so bere tenten ni.
I know you know that though	Minim sɛ wunim saa nanso
Maybe just one thing.	Ebia ade biako pɛ.
So that doesn’t really work out for me.	Enti ɛno nyɛ yiye mma me ankasa.
The other hand, too.	Nsa foforo no nso.
No one told me.	Obiara anka ankyerɛ me.
I give myself too much there.	Mede me ho dodo ma hɔ.
Not that it’s not an interesting idea.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɛnyɛ adwene a ɛyɛ anigye.
But that is a mistake.	Nanso ɛno yɛ mfomso.
This means that it is	Eyi kyerɛ sɛ ɛno ne .
I can pass it by.	Metumi atwam.
This can be a good thing and a bad thing.	Eyi betumi ayɛ ade pa ne ade bɔne.
But by then it was almost too late for that.	Nanso saa bere no na ɛkame ayɛ sɛ aka akyi dodo ama saa.
They were free.	Ná wɔyɛ kwa.
A few years.	Mfe kakraa bi.
It has been around for a while.	Ɛwɔ hɔ bere tiaa bi ni.
It was a car.	Ná ɛyɛ kar bi.
Long and strong.	Tenten na ɛyɛ den.
I did very well in school.	Meyɛɛ yiye yiye wɔ sukuu mu.
We were just the best.	Ná yɛyɛ nea eye sen biara ara kwa.
I just can’t tolerate that	Mintumi mma saa asɛm no ho kwan kɛkɛ
I have to take care of myself.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ me ho.
I have a big house and an expensive car	Mewɔ ofie kɛse ne kar a ne bo yɛ den
Happiness like he had never known before.	Anigye a ɛte sɛ nea na onnim da.
A chance to join in before their days begin	Hokwan a wɔde bɛka ho ansa na wɔn nna no afi ase
However, it is beside the point.	Nanso, ɛwɔ asɛm no nkyɛn.
I wonder if he was someone who used to work here	Misusuw sɛ ebia na ɔyɛ obi a na ɔyɛ adwuma wɔ ha anaa
I didn’t want to feel anything for him	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete biribiara nka ma no
No license is required either.	Tumi krataa biara nso ho nhia.
I was by no means a perfect person	Ná menyɛ onipa a ɔyɛ pɛ ɔkwan biara so
But that takes money and that takes willpower.	Nanso ɛno gye sika na ɛno nso gye ɔpɛ.
But this takes time, practice, and a bit of trial and error.	Nanso eyi gye bere, adesua, ne sɔhwɛ ne mfomso kakra.
That’s what he wanted to hear.	Ɛno ne nea na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔte.
I want you to trust yourself	Mepɛ sɛ wode wo ho to wo ho so
Start again.	Fi ase bio.
Is that what happened.	So ɛno na esii.
It wasn’t wise.	Ná ɛnyɛ nyansa.
It’s very obvious.	Ɛda adi yiye.
No portrait was ever so perfect and beautiful as hers.	Mfonini biara nni hɔ a na ɛyɛ pɛ na ɛyɛ fɛ te sɛ ɔno da.
A dog with a dog indeed	Ɔkraman a ɔwɔ ɔkraman ampa
He would make a simple meal.	Ná ɔbɛyɛ aduan a ɛnyɛ den.
This is due to a variety of factors.	Eyi fi nneɛma ahorow.
However, this is not the case.	Nanso, eyi nte saa.
It’s a test for us.	Ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ ma yɛn.
This applies to our children.	Eyi fa yɛn mma ho.
I don’t know how long it’s been	Minnim bere tenten a ɛyɛ
This wasn’t just two hours.	Na eyi nyɛ nnɔnhwerew abien pɛ.
It was incredibly cold in our room.	Ná awɔw wom a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ yɛn dan mu.
I don’t know anything about it	Minnim ho hwee
I have to believe that	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye saa asɛm no di
I didn’t care if he didn’t like me	Sɛ n’ani nnye me ho a, na ɛnyɛ me asɛm
The only child.	Abofra koro pɛ.
I will make you a new person	Mede wo bɛyɛ onipa foforo
He is at work.	Ɔwɔ adwumam.
I glance at both of them	Mede n’ani kyerɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa
I can go home alone	Me nkutoo metumi akɔ fie
One has to count one, two.	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi kan biako, abien.
If this sounds too good to be true, that’s because it is.	Sɛ eyi te sɛ nea eye dodo sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nokware a, ɛno ne sɛ ɛte saa.
I know what they are, after all	Minim nea wɔyɛ, ne nyinaa akyi no
Just very bad and wrong and not good.	Kɛkɛ bɔne paa ne mfomso na ɛnyɛ papa.
Hands on him.	Nsa a ɛwɔ ne so.
This will continue to be the case.	Eyi bɛkɔ so ayɛ saa.
I could taste myself	Ná metumi aka me ho ahwɛ
He knew he must be very powerful.	Ná onim sɛ ɛbɛyɛ sɛ ɔwɔ tumi kɛse.
I hope they all feel that way	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wɔn nyinaa te nka saa
He does them good.	Ɔyɛ wɔn yiye.
A human girl about her age	Onipa abeawa bi a ɔbɛyɛ ne mfe
Those mistakes shouldn’t be.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ saa mfomso ahorow no yɛ saa.
The first room seemed insignificant.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea dan a edi kan no nyɛ hwee.
This was important.	Ná eyi ho hia.
We can’t do that.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
He is one of the very few.	Ɔyɛ nnipa kakraa bi pɛ no mu biako.
Many people are interested in this.	Nnipa pii ani gye eyi ho.
You get a job.	Wo nsa ka adwuma.
I knew you were with me every day	Ná minim sɛ woka me ho da biara da
I couldn’t do that before.	Ná mintumi nyɛ saa kan.
I'm not sure if it is yet.	Me nnim sɛ ɛyɛ saa de besi nnɛ anaa.
I could get out before too long	Ná metumi afi adi ansa na bere tenten dodo
He wants to rule over them.	Ɔpɛ sɛ odi wɔn so.
Something terrible must have happened.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ biribi a ɛyɛ hu sii.
Everyone at that school is so perfect.	Obiara a ɔwɔ saa sukuu no mu no yɛ pɛ yiye.
That’s a lot of work.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma kɛse.
You walk with me.	Wo ne me nantew.
I think no one wants to do that	Misusuw sɛ obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa
It has to be me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ me.
Some of it, anyway.	Ne bi, sɛnea ɛte biara.
They tell me you might be able to help	Wɔka kyerɛ me sɛ ebia wubetumi aboa
Much to think about here	Pii a ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho wɔ ha
I have some life in me.	Mewɔ nkwa bi wɔ me mu.
First for that, for him.	Nea edi kan ma ɛno, ma no.
Even movies do that.	Sini ahorow mpo yɛ saa.
That translates into all the graphics working fine.	Ɛno kyerɛ ase sɛ mfonini ahorow no nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye.
Everything was something else.	Ná biribiara yɛ biribi foforo.
Stay on the road.	Tra kwan no so.
I really couldn’t tell them much	Ankasa na mintumi nka pii nkyerɛ wɔn
If only it were beautiful.	Sɛ anka ɛyɛ fɛ a.
They tell a story that is completely new to me.	Wɔka asɛm bi a ɛyɛ foforo koraa ma me.
One he has been doing for years and years.	Biako a wayɛ mfe ne mfe pii.
And there was someone else.	Na obi foforo nso wɔ hɔ.
I can’t imagine it.	Mintumi nsusuw ho.
I wanted him to be with me	Ná mepɛ sɛ ɔka me ho
He’s not that bad.	Ɔnyɛ bɔne saa.
It was completely packed with people and cars.	Ná nnipa ne kar ahyɛ mu ma koraa.
I hope to be part of the man he was.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mɛyɛ ɔbarima a na ɔyɛ no fã.
Still, I just wondered who her mother was	Nanso, na misusuw sɛ hena ne ne maame ho ara kwa
This has two consequences.	Eyi de nneɛma abien ba.
I felt it in my sleep routine.	Metee nka wɔ me nna ho nhyehyɛe mu.
It’s a mindset that exists.	Ɛyɛ adwene a ɛwɔ hɔ.
The idea is here.	Adwene no wɔ ha.
You only get one more new car now.	Wo nsa ka kar foforo biako pɛ bio mprempren.
I want to think this through	Mepɛ sɛ misusuw eyi ho yiye
It was a long and dangerous journey.	Ná ɛyɛ ɔkwan tenten a asiane wom.
They are a good team.	Wɔyɛ kuw pa.
I had no idea something so dramatic could happen	Ná minni adwene biara sɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa saa betumi asi
He didn't have to do that.	Ná enhia sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
My friends.	Me nnamfo.
I just can’t sleep at night	Mintumi nna anadwo kɛkɛ
Just a moment.	Bere tiaa bi kɛkɛ.
I want to hear the whole story.	Mepɛ sɛ mete asɛm no nyinaa.
This is how it works in this industry.	Eyi ne sɛnea ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
I know who they are	Minim wɔn a wɔyɛ
I absolutely loved this book	M’ani gyee nhoma yi ho koraa
Only this time, it’s good.	Saa bere yi nkutoo, ɛyɛ papa.
This meeting continued	Saa nhyiam yi kɔɔ so .
I hope it works out in person.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ yiye wɔ ankasa mu.
I heard what happened	Metee nea esii
I had planned to be there for her first home of the night.	Ná mayɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mɛkɔ hɔ ama ne fie a edi kan anadwo no.
Just one thing, it wasn’t hot.	Ade biako pɛ, na ɛnyɛ hyew.
I am surprised that you do not know me well now.	Ɛyɛ me nwonwa sɛ mprempren wunnim me yiye.
But he was the strongest.	Nanso na ɔyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ den sen biara.
I found myself in a great study	Mihuu me ho wɔ adesua kɛse bi mu
Many of you must have seen it too.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ mo mu pii nso ahu.
I see them here all the time	Mihu wɔn wɔ ha bere nyinaa
It seems that	Ɛte sɛ nea .
I wanted to know more	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu pii
I still have to talk to him.	Ɛda so ara wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ me ne no kasa.
And finally, his final words.	Na awiei koraa no, ne nsɛm a etwa to no.
It’s a lot for one man.	Ɛyɛ pii ma ɔbarima biako.
I seem to be great about it.	Ɛte sɛ nea meyɛ kɛse wɔ ho.
That’s a big day for us.	Ɛno yɛ da kɛse ma yɛn.
I knew that more acutely now than ever	Ná minim saa denneennen mprempren sen bere biara
And things have been going on.	Na nneɛma akɔ so.
I thought it was him	Misusuwii sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno
But here’s what we do.	Nanso nea yɛyɛ ni.
But he's not here, so we can talk about it.	Nanso onni ha, enti yebetumi aka ho asɛm.
Put them in with his.	Fa wɔn ne ne de no hyɛ mu.
I was very beautiful	Ná me ho yɛ fɛ yiye
Whatever we do, we have to work fast.	Nea yɛbɛyɛ biara no, ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ adwuma ntɛmntɛm.
I have also added a car	Mede kar nso aka ho
I watch them do the same thing	Mehwɛ sɛnea wɔyɛ ade koro no ara no
I only know one, too	Minim biako pɛ, nso
I believe it doesn’t matter	Migye di sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee
For years I have wanted something similar	Mfe pii ni na mepɛ biribi a ɛte saa ara
He is a real person.	Ɔyɛ onipa ankasa.
It had been easy enough.	Ná ayɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Or, it’s happening just as fast.	Anaasɛ, ɛrekɔ so ntɛmntɛm saa ara.
This made me feel better.	Eyi maa me ho tɔɔ me.
Many of them never get used to it	Wɔn mu pii nyɛ wɔn su da
But without him, there would be nothing.	Nanso sɛ ɔno nni hɔ a, anka biribiara nni hɔ.
It’s a movie.	Ɛyɛ sini.
I think he is, too.	Misusuw sɛ ɔno nso te saa.
But this is a long time.	Nanso eyi yɛ bere tenten.
I can do absolutely nothing without music.	Mintumi nyɛ hwee koraa a nnwom nka ho.
I was doing too much	Ná mereyɛ nneɛma pii dodo
That’s the way it is in that city.	Saa na ɛte wɔ saa kurow no mu.
But it’s fun.	Nanso ɛyɛ anigye.
I need to know that he doesn’t believe it either	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛ ɔno nso nnye nni
He's hurting right now.	Ɔreyɛ no yaw mprempren ara.
I shouldn’t be that pretty	Ɛnsɛ sɛ me ho yɛ fɛ saa
However, it is very pretty and stylish.	Nanso, ɛyɛ fɛ yiye na ɛyɛ fɛ.
I know how this happened	Minim sɛnea eyi sii
I don’t really know what he’s doing.	Minnim nea ɔreyɛ no ankasa.
That’s not what this is about.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nea eyi fa ho.
He had done this many times.	Ná wayɛ eyi mpɛn pii.
I hadn't even thought about him bringing up the idea	Ná minsusuw ho mpo sɛ ɔde adwene no bɛba
He knows that much.	Onim saa pii no.
I've got everything right.	Mede biribiara akɔ so yiye.
At that point, however, the game was level.	Nanso, saa bere no, na agoru no ayɛ pɛ.
What happened was an accident.	Nea esii no yɛ akwanhyia.
I heard from him yesterday	Metee fii ne hɔ nnɛra
There was so much to do.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I could barely hear him.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nte ne nte.
I have nothing to say to them	Minni asɛm biara a mɛka akyerɛ wɔn
I don’t want to be his wife	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ ne yere
It was the night before.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo a edi kan no.
I didn’t know your mother would be with us	Na minnim sɛ wo maame bɛka yɛn ho
The offer is simple.	Nea wɔde ma no yɛ mmerɛw.
I have to keep you awake	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so ma w’ani da hɔ
I have a job too	Me nso mewɔ adwuma bi
This may seem too soon.	Ebia ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea eyi yɛ ntɛm dodo.
I was the last chance	Ná me ne hokwan a etwa to
I would like more information on this subject.	Mepɛ asɛm yi ho nsɛm pii.
This is pretty close.	Eyi bɛn yiye.
People have used it with us.	Nkurɔfo de adi dwuma wɔ yɛn nkyɛn.
I would have known that	Anka minim saa
That’s not really new.	Ɛno nyɛ ade foforo ankasa.
I am the only one who can help him now	Me nkutoo na metumi aboa no mprempren
It’s not the first time this has happened.	Ɛnyɛ bere a edi kan a aba saa.
For me, it still is.	Wɔ me fam no, ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
I was completely alone	Ná me nkutoo na mewɔ hɔ koraa
It’s more like him.	Ɛte sɛ ɔno kɛse.
Perhaps over many years.	Ebia wɔ mfe pii mu.
I still like them a lot	Meda so ara pɛ wɔn ho asɛm kɛse
He didn't have many people left.	Ná onni nnipa pii a aka.
Important events occurred later in this day.	Nsɛm a ɛho hia sii akyiri yi wɔ saa da yi mu.
He had plenty of time.	Ná ɔwɔ bere pii.
I was feeling very, very bad.	Ná mete nka bɔne kɛse paa.
Nothing was ever so simple.	Biribiara nni hɔ a na ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa da.
It might be too late now.	Ebia na aka akyi dodo mprempren.
I really want to see you	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wo paa
I should be happy for him	Ɛsɛ sɛ m’ani gye ma no
Most likely they do.	Ɛda adi kɛse sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Give me a day.	Ma me da koro.
I really wish people could just get over it	Me yam a anka nkurɔfo betumi adi so ara kwa ankasa
I just want a simple room	Mepɛ dan a ɛnyɛ den ara kwa
I just wanted you to know a few things about it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ wuhu nneɛma kakraa bi fa ho ara kwa.
And still tried to help me.	Na ɛda so ara bɔɔ mmɔden sɛ ɔbɛboa me.
I never wanted this house	Na mempɛ saa ofie yi da
I can’t tell you why right now	Mintumi nka nea enti a ɛte saa nkyerɛ wo mprempren
And guess what, each of them would have been wrong.	Na susuw ho hwɛ, anka wɔn mu biara bedi mfomso.
Please for today!.	Mesrɛ wo ma nnɛ!.
I do that right now, anyway	Meyɛ saa mprempren ara, ɔkwan biara so
I felt so happy	Metee anigye kɛse nka
This is going to be a long story.	Eyi bɛyɛ asɛm tenten bi.
I know what happened.	Minim nea esii.
I always say it	Meka no bere nyinaa
It is significant and true.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛho hia na ɛyɛ nokware.
The school moved the following week	Sukuu no tu kɔɔ baabi foforo wɔ dapɛn a edi hɔ no mu
Before anything else, water.	Ansa na biribi foforo biara bɛba no, nsu.
There were a lot of people here tonight.	Na nnipa pii wɔ ha anadwo yi.
But there is no one to help me.	Nanso obiara nni hɔ a ɔbɛboa me.
I had to understand.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mete ase.
The two are obviously happy and content.	Ɛda adi sɛ wɔn baanu no ani agye na wɔn ani agye.
I believe we will.	Migye di sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa.
I’m enjoying it so far	M’ani agye ho de besi nnɛ
I love it in the morning.	M’ani gye ho anɔpa.
I really have no idea.	Ankasa minni ho adwene biara.
I'm so worried about you.	Wo ho haw me paa.
Which are two of my favorite things ever.	Nea ɛyɛ nneɛma abien a m’ani gye ho kɛse pɛn.
But it is still as important as ever.	Nanso ɛda so ara hia sɛnea na ɛte kan no.
We can start again in the morning.	Yebetumi afi ase bio anɔpa.
The accident happened here.	Akwanhyia no sii wɔ ha.
And that’s why it’s so exciting.	Na ɛno nti ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
I will tell you what was in it.	Meka nea na ɛwɔ mu no kyerɛ mo.
Not too pretty, you know.	Ɛnyɛ fɛ dodo, wunim.
I think it was three	Misusuw sɛ na ɛyɛ abiɛsa
It’s too easy.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw dodo.
It’s everything though.	Ɛyɛ biribiara nanso.
I know that almost well	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ minim saa yiye
' to '.	' kɔ '.
I think that would work	Misusuw sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma
I thought that was interesting	Misusuwii sɛ ɛno yɛ anigye
Look at the face, man.	Hwɛ anim, onipa.
He shouldn’t be too hard on himself though.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ den dodo wɔ ne ho de, nanso.
I had to keep going.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so.
This was usually not something he would have done.	Mpɛn pii no na eyi nyɛ ade a anka ɔbɛyɛ.
I get along with pretty much everyone	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ me ne obiara bɔ yiye
I'm self-sufficient.	Mede me ho.
I told you every single day	Meka kyerɛɛ mo da koro biara
I also put my hand on her leg	Mede me nsa nso too ne nan so
This means it shouldn’t be too obvious.	Eyi kyerɛ sɛ ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛda adi dodo.
I don’t know what it was like	Minnim sɛnea na ɛte
Don’t be slow.	Mma wo ho nyɛ mmerɛw.
Don’t be one.	Mma wonyɛ biako.
I want you to need me	Mepɛ sɛ wo hia me
It’s a wonderful thing.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa.
At least not for me.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ me de.
Don’t just act for the sake of acting.	Mma wonyɛ ade kɛkɛ mfa nyɛ ade.
There have definitely been good days, as well as bad.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ nna pa aba, ne nna bɔne nso.
He was not beautiful.	Ná ne ho nyɛ fɛ.
You only see yourself.	Wo ho nkutoo na wuhu.
I just felt what you wanted	Metee nea wopɛ no nka ara kwa
I totally understand that	Mete saa asɛm no ase koraa
I hear these things all the time	Mete saa nneɛma yi bere nyinaa
I love it, to be honest	M’ani gye ho, sɛ mɛka nokware a
You can always speed it up a bit.	Wubetumi ama ayɛ ntɛmntɛm kakra bere nyinaa.
It was always in the evening.	Ná ɛyɛ anwummere bere nyinaa.
I think it will all be over soon	Misusuw sɛ ne nyinaa bɛba awiei nnansa yi ara
He certainly didn't plan to.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔnyɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I just loved working with him	Ná m’ani gye ho ara kwa sɛ me ne no bɛyɛ adwuma
You might like it for tonight.	Ebia w’ani begye ho ama anadwo yi.
That’s pretty amazing.	Ɛno yɛ nwonwa yiye.
I am in pain	Mete yaw mu
I heard a knock on the door.	Metee sɛ obi rebɔ ɔpon no mu.
I brought him there.	Mede no baa hɔ.
Good things for the city.	Nneɛma a eye ma kurow no.
I could get more work for them soon	Ná metumi anya adwuma pii ama wɔn nnansa yi ara
It sounds so strange, and yet so simple.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa yiye, na nanso ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
He is a tall man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima tenten.
It wasn’t difficult.	Ná ɛnyɛ den.
I must have been looking weak	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na mehwɛ ade a ɛyɛ mmerɛw
He was very happy with this arrangement, anyway.	N’ani gyee nhyehyɛe yi ho yiye, ɔkwan biara so.
They didn't have to and he knew it.	Na enhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa na na onim.
However, this is much closer to what is happening.	Nanso, eyi bɛn nea ɛrekɔ so no kɛse.
I didn’t know what to do for him	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ ama no
Like most things.	Te sɛ nneɛma dodow no ara.
A new era has come upon us.	Bere foforo aba yɛn so.
They should have brought food.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde aduan ba.
I work on that every day now.	Meyɛ saa ho adwuma da biara da mprempren.
But this might be the best of them all	Nanso ebia eyi bɛyɛ nea eye sen biara wɔ wɔn nyinaa mu
I also see the room inside	Mihu dan a ɛwɔ mu no nso
Do whatever you want.	Yɛ nea wopɛ biara.
It’s more important to be warm than hot.	Ɛho hia sɛ wo ho yɛ hyew sen sɛ wo ho yɛ hyew.
But that doesn’t mean anything to kids today.	Nanso ɛno nkyerɛ hwee mma mmofra nnɛ.
Within a year.	Wɔ afe biako mu.
I thought he was really strong	Misusuwii sɛ na ne ho yɛ den ankasa
I understand completely	Mete ase koraa
I thought you were someone else	Misusuwii sɛ woyɛ obi foforo
I want to be alone for a while	Mepɛ sɛ me nkutoo tra hɔ kakra
Anyone can use it.	Obiara betumi de adi dwuma.
But I don't know how.	Nanso minnim sɛnea wɔyɛ no.
It wasn’t much work, really.	Na ɛnyɛ adwuma kɛse, ampa.
I don’t even have a house.	Minni ofie mpo.
He can go tonight.	Obetumi akɔ anadwo yi.
I didn't know and I didn't really care	Ná minnim na na ɛnyɛ me asɛm ankasa
There was work, and money, and a little power.	Na adwuma wɔ hɔ, ne sika, ne tumi kakra.
Put it on the table.	Fa no hyɛ so.
I just wanted to make a statement	Ná mepɛ sɛ meka asɛm bi kɛkɛ
I want to move on to another project.	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ adwuma foforo so.
He has the hair.	Ɔno na ɔwɔ ti nhwi no.
I know so many things	Minim nneɛma pii paa
So, what is this book about.	Enti, dɛn na nhoma yi fa ho.
I can’t believe we can’t do something about it	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ yɛrentumi nyɛ ho biribi
You are all a pleasure to work with.	Mo nyinaa yɛ anigye sɛ mo ne mo bɛyɛ adwuma.
And no one went.	Na obiara ankɔ.
I can’t have you that way	Mintumi nnya wo saa kwan no so
If you like it, you can add it.	Sɛ w’ani gye ho a, wubetumi de aka ho.
I had to see how he was doing	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea ne ho te
It’s good that you’re interested though.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ w’ani gye ho nanso.
I have known them for a long time	Minim wɔn fi bere tenten
More details will be coming soon.	Nsɛm pii bɛba nnansa yi ara.
They love their cars.	Wɔn ani gye wɔn kar ho.
They’re full of them too.	Wɔn nso ayɛ hɔ ma.
I know exactly what he does	Minim nea ɔyɛ no yiye
I don’t think that’s too important.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛno ho hia dodo.
It was a great bed, though.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ mpa kɛse bi.
Things were going well for him.	Ná nneɛma rekɔ yiye wɔ ne ho.
Like really bad.	Te sɛ bɔne ankasa.
But be careful.	Nanso hwɛ yiye.
I told you this was dangerous	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ eyi yɛ asiane
However, this doesn’t necessarily have to be true.	Nanso, ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ nokware ankasa.
I had childcare expenses	Ná mewɔ ka a mede hwɛ mmofra no
This could be you.	Eyi betumi ayɛ wo.
Or one of a kind.	Anaasɛ biako a ɛte saa.
You should be happy about that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ w’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
The project could go downhill.	Ná adwuma no betumi akɔ fam koraa.
Copies of the paintings.	Mfonini ahorow no mfonini ahorow.
Maybe we both are.	Ebia yɛn baanu nyinaa te saa.
I think this is a good idea.	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ adwene pa.
It is no longer necessary.	Ɛho nhia bio.
Often it was the other way around.	Mpɛn pii no, na ɛyɛ ɔkwan foforo so.
He just states the plan.	Ɔka nhyehyɛe no ara kwa.
A man is sitting next to me	Ɔbarima bi te me nkyɛn
But stay a little longer.	Nanso tra hɔ kakra.
This was not the case.	Ná eyi nyɛ saa.
Someone else will do the same.	Obi foforo nso bɛyɛ saa.
I could have tried.	Ná metumi abɔ mmɔden.
A few here and a few there	Kakraa bi wɔ ha na kakraa bi nso wɔ hɔ
Every day it gets bigger.	Da biara ɛyɛ kɛse.
He’s getting bigger.	Ɔreyɛ kɛse.
I did something today	Meyɛɛ biribi nnɛ
And no one wants to risk that.	Na obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔde saa asɛm no to asiane mu.
They were all gone.	Ná wɔn nyinaa nni hɔ bio.
That's not a huge issue for me though.	Ɛno nyɛ asɛm kɛse bi ma me de, nanso.
I thought about what I would do	Misusuw nea mɛyɛ ho
Everything had gone well.	Ná biribiara akɔ no yiye.
I have to work all the time	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma bere nyinaa
I didn’t think he could do that	Na minsusuw sɛ obetumi ayɛ saa
But it is not a system.	Nanso ɛnyɛ nhyehyɛe bi.
That’s how it works, it’s as simple as that.	Saa na ɛyɛ adwuma, ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛte no.
It’s too big.	Ɛyɛ kɛse dodo.
I want to know what he wants	Mepɛ sɛ mihu nea ɔpɛ
That day was not without its problems.	Saa da no nso nyɛ nea ɔhaw biara nni ho.
I know him.	Minim no.
Just don't know what that would be.	Kɛkɛ a minnim nea ɛno bɛyɛ.
None of them mattered much to me	Ná wɔn mu biara ho nhia me pii
He was fantastic, but not in a good way.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔyɛ nwonwa, nanso na ɛnyɛ ɔkwan pa so.
I just gave it to them	Mede maa wɔn ara kwa
The course is fast.	Adesua no yɛ ntɛmntɛm.
I don’t like the kids going outside.	M’ani nnye ho sɛ mmofra no bɛkɔ abɔnten.
I signed this one up	Mede me nsa hyɛɛ eyi ase
I don't need it	Me ho nhia me
And you don’t want to do that.	Na wompɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
He is truly happy.	Ɔwɔ anigye ankasa.
They both burned the mouth.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa hyew ano no.
His books continue to speak to me even now.	Ne nhoma ahorow no kɔ so kasa kyerɛ me mprempren mpo.
And people don’t use it.	Na nkurɔfo mfa nni dwuma.
I almost wanted him to	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mepɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa
Look at my hands.	Hwɛ me nsa.
It should be easy.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
You have to do something for me.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ biribi ma me.
I have all his power	Mewɔ ne tumi nyinaa
Because of a bad day.	Da bɔne bi nti.
I was just a boy.	Ná meyɛ abarimaa bi kɛkɛ.
I couldn't believe how amazing she looked	Ná mintumi nnye sɛnea na ne ho yɛ nwonwa no nni
But a girl like you shouldn't come here.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ abeawa te sɛ wo ba ha.
There is no problem.	Ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
You, if necessary.	Wo, sɛ ɛho hia a.
This is a problem.	Eyi yɛ ɔhaw.
I hear a lot about it now	Mete ho nsɛm pii mprempren
He was a good kid.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra pa.
In, not aside.	Wɔ, ɛnyɛ nkyɛn.
I only have my father	Me papa nkutoo na mewɔ
Now that time is almost gone.	Seesei ɛkame ayɛ sɛ saa bere no atwam.
It’s a terrible thing to do	Ɛyɛ ade a ɛyɛ hu sɛ wobɛyɛ
But that was only on the street.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ abɔnten so nkutoo.
For many, this would be it.	Wɔ nnipa pii fam no, anka eyi bɛyɛ saa.
He is not our character.	Ɔnyɛ yɛn su.
I think that was almost a year ago now	Misusuw sɛ ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ afe a atwam ni mprempren
Each one reminds me that we are not alone.	Wɔn mu biara kae me sɛ ɛnyɛ yɛn nkutoo.
I can’t believe that	Mintumi nnye saa asɛm no nni
This is not something we have any control over.	Eyi nyɛ biribi a yɛwɔ so tumi biara.
I used to have it, anyway	Kan no na mewɔ, sɛnea ɛte biara
Any help would be great.	Mmoa biara bɛyɛ kɛse.
I headed for the door	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ ɔpon no ano
If they are happy.	Sɛ wɔn ani gye a.
I want him to say my name more often	Mepɛ sɛ ɔka me din mpɛn pii
Somehow, he knew.	Ɔkwan bi so no, na onim.
His own name, and he knew it.	Ɔno ankasa din, na na onim.
There was no doubt about the gravity of their situation.	Ná akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ sɛnea wɔn tebea no mu yɛ den no.
Just do the best job you can.	Yɛ adwuma a eye sen biara a wubetumi ayɛ ara kwa.
I just want to do that.	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ saa ara kwa.
I'm getting hot.	Me ho yɛ hyew.
I have to think about it carefully.	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho yiye.
If he is happy.	Sɛ ɔwɔ anigye a.
I have something to tell you.	Mewɔ biribi a mɛka akyerɛ wo.
It was definitely amazing.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛyɛ nwonwa.
Here is our new recipe.	Yɛn aduan foforo a yɛde yɛ aduan no ni.
Get out to the back.	Fi adi kɔ akyi.
Naturally, this persisted a few days later.	Sɛnea ɛte no, eyi kɔɔ so traa hɔ nna kakraa bi akyi.
I don't have a house	Minni ofie
And the city gave him a lot.	Na kurow no maa no nneɛma pii.
I think he can go that far	Misusuw sɛ obetumi akɔ akyiri saa
I have used the telephone before	Mede telefon adi dwuma pɛn
I always have so much to do.	Bere nyinaa mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ.
I enjoyed our recent summer	M’ani gyee yɛn nnansa yi awɔw bere no ho
But the letter didn’t get around.	Nanso krataa no ankɔ so ankɔ so.
This is definitely one of those things.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ eyi yɛ saa nneɛma no mu biako.
That might be a problem for him.	Ebia ɛno bɛyɛ ɔhaw ama no.
But that doesn’t work here.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
I have no idea where he would go	Minni baabi a anka ɔbɛkɔ ho adwene biara
I have to go home to my son.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ fie kɔ me ba no nkyɛn.
And he will do so.	Na ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I could never do that	Na mintumi nyɛ saa da
The dress wasn’t even me.	Ná atade no nyɛ me mpo.
This also made the job even less fun.	Eyi nso maa adwuma no anyɛ anigye kɛse mpo.
I really have to tell you	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo ankasa
I'm sorry, but it's happening.	Mepa wo kyɛw, nanso ɛrekɔ so.
Maybe he could see again.	Ebia na n’ani ahu ade bio.
Not for this reason.	Ɛnyɛ eyi nti.
None of them can win.	Wɔn mu biara ntumi nni nkonim.
I think this is the best for everyone	Misusuw sɛ eyi ne nea eye ma obiara
Except for one important thing.	Gye ade biako a ɛho hia.
I couldn’t get out of it, really	Na mintumi mfi mu, ampa
I really enjoyed that movie	M’ani gyee saa sini no ho paa
He lied to her.	Ɔyɛɛ no ​​atoro.
Make a weekend out of it.	Yɛ dapɛn awiei bi fi mu.
The story is not new.	Asɛm no nyɛ asɛm foforo.
I saw and heard things	Mihuu nneɛma na metee nso
I still have this problem	Meda so ara wɔ ɔhaw yi
I should have been careful.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ yiye.
I wish he would say something, anything	Me yam a anka ɔbɛka biribi, biribiara
A door slammed shut.	Ɔpon bi too mu.
I had no power left	Ná minni tumi biara bio
The first week was tough.	Ná dapɛn a edi kan no mu yɛ den.
I think he has a point.	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ asɛm bi.
That’s the problem with the truth.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw a ɛwɔ nokware no ho.
Those things are expensive.	Saa nneɛma no bo yɛ den.
He was never one to talk much about work.	Ná ɔnyɛ obi a ɔka adwuma ho asɛm pii da.
Just lay there and let it be.	Da hɔ kɛkɛ na ma ɛnyɛ nea ɛte.
It works for one or two people.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ma onipa biako anaa baanu.
It was a busy night for him.	Ná ɛyɛ anadwo a adagyew nnim ama no.
I think it might be something else	Misusuw sɛ ebia ɛyɛ biribi foforo
There was a lot going on.	Ná nneɛma pii rekɔ so.
I also have a meditation space at home	Mewɔ baabi a misusuw nneɛma ho nso wɔ fie
Interesting people and how they act.	Nnipa a wɔn ani gye ho ne sɛnea wɔyɛ wɔn ade.
Or as the supply chain continues.	Anaasɛ bere a nneɛma a wɔde ma no kɔ so no.
They will be given.	Wɔde bɛma.
You sleep with me again.	Wo ne me da bio.
I'm on the ground.	Mewɔ fam.
He spent the rest of the time planning the game	Ɔde bere a aka no yɛɛ agoru no ho nhyehyɛe
The man has my stuff.	Ɔbarima no wɔ me nneɛma.
He was a better person than she was.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa pa sen no.
I can do anything here	Metumi ayɛ biribiara wɔ ha
A girl is with him.	Abeawa bi ka ne ho.
People made a place.	Nkurɔfo yɛɛ baabi.
There are resources available.	Nneɛma a wɔde di dwuma wɔ hɔ.
I should have trusted him	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mede me ho to no so
Any input would be great.	Nsɛm biara a wɔde bɛba no bɛyɛ kɛse.
It wasn’t that big of a deal.	Na ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse saa.
There is no error but the picture is not visible.	Mfomso biara nni hɔ nanso mfonini no ntumi nhu.
I get along well with everyone	Me ne obiara bɔ yiye
I could watch that one	Ná metumi ahwɛ saa biako no
This evil is long-standing.	Saa bɔne yi yɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ bere tenten.
I didn't want to do anything wrong.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea mepɛ sɛ meyɛ bɔne biara.
We are the good guys here.	Yɛn na yɛyɛ nnipa pa a yɛwɔ ha.
He was one of my best friends.	Ná ɔyɛ me nnamfo paa no mu biako.
It was a surprisingly good one.	Ná ɛyɛ papa bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I think about things	Misusuw nneɛma ho
I have no control over them anymore	Minni wɔn so tumi biara bio
This must be done.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi.
I think that’s the important thing for him	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne ade a ɛho hia no
That was all behind us.	Ná ɛno nyinaa wɔ yɛn akyi.
But they both seem to be involved.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea wɔn baanu nyinaa de wɔn ho ahyɛ mu.
The end state.	Awiei tebea no.
Say nothing.	Nka hwee.
I was hoping someone would show up soon	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ obi bɛba nnansa yi ara
It’s just that the mind is powerful.	Ɛyɛ sɛ adwene no wɔ tumi ara kwa.
I love the acting in this movie	M’ani gye agoru a wɔyɛ wɔ sini yi mu no ho
I saw him for what he really was	Mihuu no sɛnea na ɔyɛ ankasa
After all, it’s their job.	Ne nyinaa akyi no, ɛyɛ wɔn adwuma.
They’re all just so good.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ papa ara kwa.
Make their food.	Yɛ wɔn aduan.
I love the team here	M’ani gye kuw a ɛwɔ ha no ho
I hope you work it out so he can come home	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wobɛyɛ ho adwuma sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a obetumi aba fie
It must be given in its entirety.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde ne nyinaa ma.
They are what they are.	Wɔyɛ nea wɔyɛ.
It’s obviously a good one	Ɛda adi sɛ ɛyɛ papa
Are you there.	Wowɔ hɔ.
I wasn't fast enough	Ná menyɛ ntɛmntɛm sɛnea ɛsɛ
A beautiful and wonderful time	Bere a ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ nwonwa
It’s just something you have to get used to.	Ɛyɛ biribi a ɛsɛ sɛ wode yɛ wo su ara kwa.
But in the foreground there is only so much of what was behind.	Nanso wɔ anim no, nea na ɛwɔ akyi no pii nkutoo na ɛwɔ hɔ.
I always give myself to you	Mede me ho ma wo bere nyinaa
I was too early for them though.	Na meyɛ ntɛm dodo maa wɔn nanso.
Not this fast.	Ɛnyɛ eyi ntɛmntɛm.
I think you’ve finally done it	Misusuw sɛ awiei koraa no woayɛ
Maybe there’s something else to that.	Ebia biribi foforo wɔ saa ho.
He was a terrible and wonderful man.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ hu na ne ho yɛ nwonwa.
I would add some other things	Anka mede nneɛma foforo bi bɛka ho
We have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
I need to know why people follow it	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea enti a nkurɔfo di akyi
That’s a lot of people.	Ɛno yɛ nnipa pii.
I am too young.	Meyɛ abofra dodo.
I know a lot about what people want	Minim nneɛma pii fa nea nkurɔfo pɛ ho
He always does, she tells him.	Ɔyɛ saa bere nyinaa, ɔka kyerɛ no.
I believe it.	Migye di.
He told himself he could do this.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ obetumi ayɛ eyi.
That’s the floor.	Ɛno ne fam no.
I didn’t do that	Ɛnyɛ me na meyɛɛ saa
So there was always that part.	Enti na saa fã no wɔ hɔ bere nyinaa.
He slid his hands down.	Ɔde ne nsa too fam.
Maybe he was just surprised.	Ebia na ne ho dwiriw no ara kwa.
I'm just saying.	Meka kɛkɛ sɛ.
I can’t begin to tell you what it was like	Mintumi mfi ase nka sɛnea na ɛte no nkyerɛ wo
I'm sorry I ever do this.	Mepa wo kyɛw sɛ meyɛ eyi da.
It’s like a whole new job.	Ɛte sɛ adwuma foforo koraa.
The latter may be due to a number of factors.	Ebia nneɛma ahorow bi nti na nea etwa to no fi.
I have no idea where he even lives now	Minni baabi a ɔte mprempren mpo ho adwene biara
I just want to end with this one thing.	Mepɛ sɛ mede ade biako yi ba awiei kɛkɛ.
I didn’t want to impress anyone	Ná mempɛ sɛ m’ani gye obiara ho
Maybe I could have helped him that night.	Ebia anka metumi aboa no saa anadwo no.
I didn’t want to know	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu
I know both of them.	Minim wɔn baanu nyinaa.
Very good value for the price.	Bo a ɛyɛ papa yiye ma bo no.
However, I’ll be interested.	Nanso, m’ani begye ho.
I was good for one thing and one thing only	Ná meyɛ papa ma ade biako ne ade biako pɛ
We have a lot in common, you know.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛyɛ pɛ, wunim.
I look into his eyes	Mehwɛ n’ani so
He was the one who made the arrangements.	Ɔno na ɔyɛɛ nhyehyɛe.
I had everything to myself.	Ná mewɔ biribiara ma me ho.
I spent the night with you	Me ne wo traa anadwo no
For more details cf.	Sɛ wopɛ nsɛm pii a, hwɛ.
He is so hot right now.	Ɔyɛ hyew yiye mprempren.
He made friends with her one night.	Ɔne no nyaa nnamfo anadwo bi.
Almost all the songs have been forgotten	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ werɛ afi nnwom no nyinaa
And for two reasons.	Na nneɛma abien nti.
Worked well for two days.	Adwuma yiye nna abien.
It’s a sin for us.	Ɛyɛ bɔne ma yɛn.
I hope you all enjoyed it	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo nyinaa ani gyee ho
I doubt we can make things better	Migye kyim sɛ yebetumi ama nneɛma ayɛ yiye
I know your father and mother	Minim wo papa ne wo maame
I tell him that.	Meka saa kyerɛ no.
I didn’t know what to do with the boy	Ná minnim nea me ne abarimaa no bɛyɛ
Every moment may be the last.	Ebia bere biara yɛ nea etwa to.
I had no money and no food in my empty apartment.	Ná minni sika na na minni aduan wɔ me dan a hwee nni mu no mu.
But there was no bed.	Nanso na mpa biara nni hɔ.
He didn't really want to.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa ankasa.
I didn’t want to watch	Ná mempɛ sɛ mehwɛ
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mfomso biara nni ho.
You can get out of this.	Wubetumi afi eyi mu.
I couldn’t control myself	Ná mintumi nni me ho so
I can control it now	Metumi adi so mprempren
in.	mu.
That was the idea.	Ná ɛno ne adwene no.
He knew this was unnecessary.	Ná onim sɛ eyi ho nhia.
I guess no one is perfect all the time	Misusuw sɛ obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ pɛ bere nyinaa
I’d love to make a movie	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ sini bi
This, my son.	Eyi, me ba.
I didn’t know him, or what he was	Na minnim no, anaa nea ɔyɛ
This may work out.	Ebia eyi bɛyɛ yiye.
You want to know everything.	Wopɛ sɛ wuhu biribiara.
I can’t think about it anymore	Mintumi nsusuw ho bio
I am like him himself	Meyɛ sɛ ɔno ankasa
That would have been something.	Anka ɛno bɛyɛ biribi.
Eye for them.	Eye ma wo.
But it’s still one.	Nanso ɛda so ara yɛ biako.
Which is really amazing.	Nea ɛyɛ nwonwa ankasa.
The latter point would seem to be the problem here.	Ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ nea asɛm a etwa to no ne ɔhaw a ɛwɔ ha no.
I had to say some things	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka nsɛm bi
My legs couldn’t understand.	Me nan antumi anhu ase.
I have to think about the long term	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw bere tenten no ho
I put one hand on the gun	Mede me nsa biako too tuo no so
Eat it in moderation.	Di no kakraa bi.
I didn’t want you to do that.	Na mempɛ sɛ wobɛyɛ saa.
I would do it again and again	Ná mɛyɛ no mpɛn pii
I can’t believe it’s been three years	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ mfe abiɛsa ni
We are bad for each other in that way.	Yɛyɛ bɔne ma yɛn ho yɛn ho wɔ saa kwan no so.
But it doesn’t matter.	Nanso ɛnyɛ hwee.
The letter was from him.	Ná krataa no fi ne hɔ.
He didn't care, really.	Ná ɛnyɛ no asɛm, ampa.
I am sorry about your child	Mepa wo kyɛw wɔ wo ba no ho
I always do that	Meyɛ saa bere nyinaa
It would be much better for them	Ná ɛbɛyɛ wɔn papa kɛse
Or a new input system.	Anaasɛ nhyehyɛe foforo a wɔde yɛ nneɛma a wɔde hyɛ mu.
I have to wonder why.	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw nea enti a ɛte saa no ho.
I can’t give you anything	Mintumi mfa biribiara mma wo
I have another story now.	Mewɔ asɛm foforo mprempren.
I want to know what it looks like	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea ɛte
I don’t care what man can do.	Nea onipa betumi ayɛ no mfa me ho.
Food is never a problem there.	Aduan nyɛ ɔhaw wɔ hɔ da.
I can’t let you have this	Mintumi mma wo nnya eyi
And you’re right there.	Na wowɔ hɔ ara.
Give a day here, take a day here.	Ma da koro wɔ ha, fa da koro wɔ ha.
I had something else	Ná mewɔ biribi foforo
This was new on me	Ná eyi yɛ foforo wɔ me so
And that will happen to me.	Na ɛno bɛba me so.
I know you didn’t know any better at the time	Minim sɛ na wunnim biribi a eye sen saa saa bere no
And it didn’t work.	Na ɛnyɛ adwuma.
But it’s not really that.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa ankasa.
And it was very much so.	Na ɛte saa kɛse.
Anyone interested in going?.	Obiara ani gye ho sɛ ɔbɛkɔ?.
I was worried about that	Ná ɛno ho asɛm haw me
I plan on going to that party	Meyɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ mɛkɔ saa apontow no ase
An old one.	Dedaw bi.
You can do the same with your dog.	Wubetumi ayɛ wo kraman no saa ara.
I wouldn’t want it to be anyone else	Anka mempɛ sɛ ɛyɛ onipa foforo biara
The house itself appears to be in good shape.	Ɛte sɛ nea ofie no ankasa wɔ tebea pa mu.
I just can't show it on you.	Mintumi mfa nkyerɛ wɔ wo so kɛkɛ.
This was not the case at all.	Ná eyi nte saa koraa.
It was a pleasure.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye.
I couldn’t seem to get away	Ɛte sɛ nea na mintumi mma me ho mfi hɔ
I have two more meetings.	Mewɔ nhyiam abien foforo.
I have very little capital	Mewɔ sika kɛse kakraa bi pɛ
Our biggest yet.	Yɛn kɛse sen biara de besi nnɛ.
We stepped into it.	Yɛde yɛn nan sii mu.
I love my old town car	M’ani gye me kurow dedaw no mu kar kɛse no ho
Everyone is everyone.	Obiara yɛ obiara.
I kind of knew that would work for me.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea minim sɛ ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma ama me.
I realized two things very quickly	Mihuu nneɛma abien ntɛmntɛm yiye
This method works well in most cases.	Saa kwan yi yɛ adwuma yiye wɔ nsɛm dodow no ara mu.
I touch my hair.	Mede me nsa ka me ti nhwi.
Pseudonyms are used here.	Wɔde atoro din na edi dwuma wɔ ha.
I didn’t have to like it	Ná enhia sɛ m’ani gye ho
But, I like you that much	Nanso, m’ani gye wo ho saa
The first of many many times.	Nea edi kan wɔ pii mpɛn pii mu.
I got on really well with them.	Me ne wɔn dii yiye ankasa.
I don’t want the money	Mempɛ sika no
You’re in it, too.	Wo nso wowɔ mu.
Surely their time would have been better spent by the water.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ wɔde wɔn bere bedi dwuma wɔ nsu no ho.
Things just can’t end.	Nneɛma ntumi nkɔ awiei ara kwa.
It was a time of great prosperity	Ná ɛyɛ bere a nnipa pii di yiye wom
Maybe I don’t have much time	Ebia minni bere pii
Next year, maybe.	Afe a edi hɔ no, ebia.
That shot is tough.	Saa tuo no yɛ den.
Everyone at the table looked down at him.	Obiara a ɔwɔ pon no so no hwɛɛ ne fam.
It is important to include it.	Ɛho hia sɛ wode ka ho.
It’s been here for a long time.	Ɛwɔ ha akyɛ ni.
I wanted to keep coming anyway	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so ba ɔkwan biara so
It didn’t matter where it was.	Na ɛnyɛ baabi a ɛwɔ no ho asɛm.
He is a tall man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima tenten bi.
But think about this.	Nanso susuw eyi ho.
This made him much stronger.	Eyi maa ne ho yɛɛ den kɛse.
How can we make people forget this.	Yɛbɛyɛ dɛn ama nkurɔfo werɛ afi eyi.
It’s where he was, and where he needs to be.	Ɛyɛ baabi a na ɔwɔ, ne baabi a ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno nso wɔ.
I told him that this was not the time	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɛnyɛ saa bere yi
I have children there.	Mewɔ mma wɔ hɔ.
The factors here can be partial.	Nneɛma a ɛwɔ ha no betumi ayɛ fã bi.
We have so much in our school.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma pii wɔ yɛn sukuu mu.
There are no jobs.	Nnwuma biara nni hɔ.
I think he knows what he’s doing	Misusuw sɛ onim nea ɔreyɛ
I think he likes people.	Misusuw sɛ n’ani gye nnipa ho.
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I have to check one more thing	Ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ ade biako bio
It wasn’t easy for me.	Ná ɛnyɛ mmerɛw mma me.
But that never happened.	Nanso ɛno amma da.
It appears to be in good shape.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛwɔ tebea pa mu.
They both understand the situation.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa te tebea no ase.
It is faster than most species.	Ɛyɛ ntɛmntɛm sen mmoa ahorow dodow no ara.
I love sex you know	M’ani gye nna ho wunim
I just couldn’t function.	Na mintumi nyɛ adwuma kɛkɛ.
That would be good.	Ɛno bɛyɛ papa.
Not in me, you can’t.	Ɛnyɛ me mu, worentumi.
That’s how the story goes.	Saa na asɛm no fa so.
I knew you were down here.	Na minim sɛ wowɔ ase ha.
To make him happy.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a n’ani begye.
I completely agree with him on this	Me ne no yɛ adwene koraa wɔ eyi ho
That’s just one meal.	Ɛno yɛ aduan biako pɛ.
I think he would have done that.	Misusuw sɛ anka ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I thought something was wrong.	Misusuwii sɛ biribi anyɛ yiye.
I definitely feel for you.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mete nka ma wo.
Maybe that’s how it should be.	Ebia saa na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ.
I could never be wrong	Na mintumi nni mfomso da
I can't really argue with this.	Mintumi ne eyi nnye akyinnye ankasa.
Use the available information.	Fa nsɛm a ɛwɔ hɔ no di dwuma.
I felt cold and just wanted to lie down	Metee awɔw nka na na mepɛ sɛ meda fam ara kwa
More importantly, the schools were gone.	Nea ɛho hia sen saa no, na sukuu ahorow no nni hɔ bio.
I designed and edited some chapters yesterday	Meyɛɛ ti ahorow bi ho mfonini na meyɛɛ ho nhyehyɛe nnɛra
I’m excited about today	M’ani agye nnɛ ho
I’m not that surprised	Ɛnyɛ me nwonwa saa
I think they are important	Misusuw sɛ wɔyɛ nea ɛho hia
You really put yourself into what you’re doing.	Wode wo ho hyɛ nea woreyɛ no mu ankasa.
But for something else.	Nanso biribi foforo nti.
He was always in pain.	Ná ɔte yaw bere nyinaa.
I like it when people play with themselves	M’ani gye ho sɛ nkurɔfo de wɔn ho bedi agoru
And I hope you know it’s not me	Na mewɔ anidaso sɛ wunim sɛ ɛnyɛ me
Outdoor hot water.	Abɔnten so nsu a ɛyɛ hyew.
You have done a very good job.	Woayɛ adwuma pa ara.
So like his dad, that one.	Enti te sɛ ne papa, saa biako no.
I just don’t know how you think enough to say.	Minnim sɛnea wususuw nea ɛdɔɔso a wobɛka ho kɛkɛ.
Please don’t leave work.	Mesrɛ wo, mma wo mfi adwumam.
I didn’t want to feel that way anymore	Ná mempɛ sɛ mete nka saa bio
I can't seem to find it anymore though	Ɛte sɛ nea mintumi nhu bio nanso
Almost no one has that.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ obiara nni hɔ a ɔwɔ saa.
I find it interesting	Mihu sɛ ɛyɛ anigye
I can make this work	Metumi ama eyi ayɛ adwuma
I used to do that.	Kan no na meyɛ saa.
Just watch that movie.	Hwɛ saa sini no ara kwa.
The first one was really hard.	Ná nea edi kan no ayɛ den ankasa.
I already think about how much time has passed	Misusuw bere dodow a atwam no ho dedaw
But you never really know.	Nanso wunnim ankasa da.
Usually, he does	Mpɛn pii no, ɔyɛ saa
One such person is his father.	Onipa a ɔte saa no mu biako ne ne papa.
Anyway, be careful now.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, hwɛ yiye mprempren.
Best time of the year.	Bere a eye sen biara wɔ afe no mu.
I couldn’t doubt it anymore.	Ná mintumi nnye ho kyim bio.
I think we can all agree on that	Misusuw sɛ yɛn nyinaa betumi ayɛ adwene wɔ saa asɛm no ho
Sounds good to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye ma me.
I think this boy will be good for you	Misusuw sɛ abarimaa yi bɛyɛ papa ama wo
This is a timely innovation.	Eyi yɛ ade foforo a ɛyɛ ne bere mu de.
It’s just that.	Ɛyɛ kɛkɛ.
No one should force himself on anyone.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ obiara hyɛ ne ho hyɛ obiara so.
I love the soft bed	M’ani gye mpa a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no ho
So it’s part of it.	Enti ɛyɛ ne fã bi.
Immediately, he gave me his hand.	Ntɛm ara, ɔde ne nsa maa me.
That’s how it works in this industry.	Saa na ɛyɛ adwuma wɔ saa adwuma yi mu.
Please put me down.	Mesrɛ wo, fa me to fam.
There would be a long time.	Anka bere tenten bɛba.
The book was a huge success, and people liked it.	Nhoma no dii yiye kɛse, na nkurɔfo ani gyee ho.
Unless he knew something.	Gye sɛ na onim biribi.
It’s a huge mistake	Ɛyɛ mfomso kɛse
I know what he knows	Minim nea onim
Many people do that.	Nnipa pii yɛ saa.
The whole job.	Adwuma no nyinaa.
Nothing very dramatic there.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa kɛse wɔ hɔ.
He’s been very excited about it.	N’ani agye ho yiye.
I never knew anything	Ná minnim hwee da
This case is one of those cases.	Saa asɛm yi yɛ saa asɛm no mu biako.
He was a warm-hearted man.	Ná ne ho yɛ hyew.
I knew all that information	Ná minim saa nsɛm no nyinaa
There must be something else then.	Ɛsɛ sɛ biribi foforo nso wɔ hɔ saa bere no.
I hadn't even thought about taking it with me	Ná minsusuw ho mpo sɛ mede bɛkɔ
But not in a good way.	Nanso ɛnyɛ ɔkwan pa so.
He slipped into it.	Ɔde ne ho too mu.
I couldn’t believe what was happening	Ná mintumi nnye nea ɛrekɔ so no nni
There was no more work to be done.	Ná adwuma biara nni hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ bio.
We’re really into diversity.	Yɛde yɛn ho ahyɛ ahorow ahorow mu ankasa.
You have done this for us.	Woayɛ yɛn eyi.
I think that would make me jealous	Misusuw sɛ ɛno bɛma m’ani bere
There were no cars in front of them.	Ná kar biara nni wɔn anim.
Other days, too.	Nna foforo nso.
I touched my hair	Mede me nsa kaa me ti nhwi
That doesn’t mean no one knew.	Ɛno nkyerɛ sɛ na obiara nnim.
Who knew for how long.	Hena na na onim bere tenten ahe.
He had done it.	Ná wayɛ no.
I’m glad to have you.	M’ani agye sɛ mewɔ wo.
We had very little money.	Ná sika kakraa bi na yɛwɔ.
Besides, he didn’t want anything too real.	Ɛno da nkyɛn a, na ɔmpɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nokware dodo.
I didn’t know, inside	Na minnim, wɔ mu
I have to do some things	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nneɛma bi
People didn’t have to be the same.	Ná enhia sɛ nkurɔfo yɛ ade koro.
I know, there are many.	Minim, pii wɔ hɔ.
I know them too well	Minim wɔn yiye dodo
Many of them still do.	Wɔn mu pii da so ara yɛ no saa.
My hands are still strong.	Me nsa da so ara yɛ den.
I live in their house	Mete wɔn fie
It works, it just works.	Ɛyɛ adwuma, ɛyɛ adwuma kɛkɛ.
This is not surprising.	Eyi nyɛ nwonwa.
The reason for this is not entirely clear.	Nea enti a ɛte saa no mu nna hɔ koraa.
I cannot see that there is a problem	Mintumi nhu sɛ ɔhaw bi wɔ hɔ
I can do that thinking for you if that’s easy	Metumi ayɛ saa adwene no ama wo sɛ ɛno yɛ mmerɛw a
But it had to be him.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ ɔno.
He had a point.	Ná ɔwɔ asɛm bi.
I can do that	Metumi ayɛ saa
We are the people who exist.	Yɛyɛ nnipa a yɛwɔ hɔ.
I know you just as you know me	Minim wo sɛnea wunim me no ara pɛ
I felt that there were many reasons to keep living	Metee nka sɛ nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so tra ase
And he was thrilled.	Na n’ani gyee ho.
It was hot in there, hot.	Ná ɛyɛ hyew wɔ hɔ, na na ɛyɛ hyew.
I had no idea what this meant	Ná minnim nea eyi kyerɛ
It wasn’t his.	Ná ɛnyɛ ne de.
No one could come inside.	Obiara antumi amma mu.
I really shouldn’t say that	Ankasa ɛnsɛ sɛ meka saa
He knew why he did it.	Ná onim nea enti a ɔyɛ saa.
Instantly, he was fully alert and alert.	Ntɛm ara, na n’ani da hɔ koraa na n’ani da hɔ.
The course though is great.	Adesua no de, nanso ɛyɛ kɛse.
Don't go into any of the rooms yet.	Mma nkɔ dan no mu biara mu de besi nnɛ.
I look forward to them	Mehwɛ wɔn kwan
That was a lie.	Ná saa asɛm no yɛ atoro.
There was almost nothing.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na hwee nni hɔ.
I didn’t know much about cars	Ná minnim kar ho nsɛm pii
Mine has never worked.	Me de no nyɛɛ adwuma da.
I think that’s his name	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne ne din
Be careful now.	Hwɛ yiye mprempren.
We use the first method in this work.	Yɛde ɔkwan a edi kan no di dwuma wɔ adwuma yi mu.
I knew what was there	Ná minim nea ɛwɔ hɔ
I really wanted to save him	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye no nkwa ankasa
The pictures are taken to the gallery.	Wɔde mfonini ahorow no kɔ baabi a wɔde nneɛma kyerɛ no.
I hear them every night	Mete wɔn anadwo biara
I hadn’t really thought about that	Ná minsusuw saa asɛm no ho ankasa
I shook hands with him	Me ne no bɔɔ nsa
I see him doing this every day	Mihu sɛ ɔreyɛ eyi da biara da
I still had things to check	Ná meda so ara wɔ nneɛma a ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu
I can see no reason why he shouldn’t.	Mintumi nhu biribiara a enti ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
But it would be bad for me.	Nanso ɛbɛyɛ bɔne ama me.
But he had a problem.	Nanso na ɔwɔ ɔhaw bi.
I have to add another one.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede foforo ka ho.
However, you are new to this.	Nanso, woyɛ foforo wɔ eyi mu.
I just wanted to check it out	Ná mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ mu ara kwa
I should have done it a long time ago.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ no bere tenten a atwam ni.
If someone could give it to me that would be great.	Sɛ obi betumi de ama me a anka ɛbɛyɛ kɛse.
I heard about all the things that happened	Metee nneɛma a esii no nyinaa ho asɛm
He was just there.	Ná ɔwɔ hɔ ara kwa.
I had to do it over and over again	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ no mpɛn pii
Just make sure they look good in the book.	Hwɛ hu ara sɛ wɔn ho yɛ fɛ wɔ nhoma no mu.
That’s what’s here.	Ɛno na ɛwɔ ha.
Everyone saw him.	Obiara huu no.
He is that dangerous.	Ɔno na ɔyɛ saa asiane no.
Somehow he had it.	Ɔkwan bi so no na ɔwɔ.
Even that felt strange.	Ɛno mpo tee nka sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I love everything about him	M’ani gye ne ho biribiara ho
Be completely honest.	Di nokware koraa.
It will all be fine.	Ne nyinaa bɛyɛ papa.
It was a terrible summer.	Ná ɛyɛ awɔw bere a ɛyɛ hu.
We have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
There was little information at the time.	Ná nsɛm kakraa bi na ɛwɔ hɔ saa bere no.
I always tell the story	Meka asɛm no bere nyinaa
I can’t even figure out what it looks like.	Me ntumi nhu sɛnea ɛte mpo.
I know you will be good	Minim sɛ wobɛyɛ papa
I think it will do me good	Misusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ me yiye
And I want to tell you.	Na mepɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo.
You probably would be planning one right now.	Ebia anka woreyɛ biako ho nhyehyɛe mprempren ara.
Obviously my mind isn’t great right now	Ɛda adi sɛ m’adwene nyɛ kɛse mprempren
I think it must be me	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ me
Discuss through your friends.	Fa wo nnamfo so susuw ho.
And he was pretty happy with her, too.	Na na n’ani gye ne ho yiye, nso.
We forgot the dog.	Yɛn werɛ fii ɔkraman no.
I wish this wasn’t the case	Me yam a anka eyi nte saa
I wonder how well that would have worked	Misusuw sɛnea anka ɛno bɛyɛ adwuma yiye no ho
These things are not random.	Saa nneɛma yi nyɛ nea wɔyɛ no kwa.
However, everyone enjoyed my talk very much.	Nanso, obiara ani gyee me kasa no ho yiye.
I can’t deal with them	Mintumi ne wɔn nni
He had to go too.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ ɔno nso kɔ.
However, both produce similar results.	Nanso, abien no nyinaa de nneɛma a ɛte saa ara fi mu ba.
Tell me how it feels.	Ka sɛnea ɛte nka kyerɛ me.
There are a lot of good things to work with here.	Nneɛma pa pii wɔ hɔ a wode bɛyɛ adwuma wɔ ha.
I didn’t know what was wrong	Ná minnim nea ɛyɛ bɔne
Everyone could see that.	Ná obiara betumi ahu sɛ.
On the snow.	Wɔ no so.
I thought he liked you	Misusuwii sɛ n’ani gye wo ho
I need to make a plan or something	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ nhyehyɛe anaa biribi
Perhaps this is also true.	Ebia eyi nso ho asɛm yɛ nokware.
If so, it’s great.	Sɛ saa a, ɛyɛ kɛse.
He didn't have to work then.	Ná ɛho nhia sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma saa bere no.
I think he did that.	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
Just one day.	Da koro pɛ.
I'm still under my bed, you know	Meda so ara wɔ me mpa ase, wunim
A really good meeting	Nhyiam a eye ankasa
He is a powerful figure.	Ɔyɛ obi a ɔwɔ tumi.
I focused on the road	Mede m’adwene sii ɔkwan no so
I talk to people.	Me ne nkurɔfo kasa.
I think you can go now	Misusuw sɛ wubetumi akɔ mprempren
Maybe I owe you my life	Ebia mede me nkwa ka wo
It was just like being with her mother.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɔne ne maame wɔ hɔ ara pɛ.
I can’t talk about it now	Mintumi nka ho asɛm mprempren
I could barely control myself	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nni me ho so
Check out more of her beautiful photos here!.	Hwɛ ne mfonini ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ no pii wɔ ha!.
You need to talk about this with your wife.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wo ne wo yere ka eyi ho asɛm.
It’s all about the money, after all.	Ne nyinaa fa sika no ho, ne nyinaa akyi no.
It’s nothing more complicated than that.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara a ɛyɛ den sen saa.
I think of one thing	Misusuw ade biako ho
All the best for them.	Nea eye sen biara ma wɔn.
I can’t really imagine it	Mintumi nsusuw ho ankasa
I understand what it is.	Mete nea ɛyɛ ase.
There is a job to be done.	Adwuma bi wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I tell everyone how he has done it	Meka sɛnea wayɛ no kyerɛ obiara
They kept an eye on me the whole time.	Wɔde wɔn ani sii me so bere no nyinaa.
They don’t have to, really.	Ɛho nhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa, ampa.
But he was faster than that.	Nanso na ɔyɛ ntɛm sen saa.
I did everything alone	Me nkutoo na meyɛɛ biribiara
I know what you mean	Minim nea wopɛ sɛ woka
He might even be interested in brainstorming with the police.	Ebia n’ani begye ho mpo sɛ ɔne polisifo bɛbɔ nyansa.
We had to be fast, tall, and conditioned.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ntɛm, yɛ tenten, na yɛyɛ yɛn ho yiye.
Which is probably very true.	Nea ebia ɛyɛ nokware paa.
That is not the point.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no.
But he didn't really know what that was.	Nanso na onnim nea ɛno yɛ ankasa.
So I wondered why.	Enti misusuw nea enti a ɛte saa no ho.
He wants to rule over them.	Ɔpɛ sɛ odi wɔn so.
But we can find our hope right here.	Nanso yebetumi ahu yɛn anidaso wɔ ha yi ara.
Nobody.	Ɛnyɛ obiara.
There was nothing he could do.	Ná biribiara nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ.
I’m like a completely different person.	Me te sɛ onipa foforo koraa.
I had to close my eyes	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka m’ani so
Take my wife away now.	Fa me yere kɔ mprempren.
I cannot go into details	Mintumi nkɔ nsɛm mu kɔ akyiri
This almost made me put the book down.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ eyi maa me de nhoma no too fam.
I was an easy target	Ná meyɛ obi a ɛnyɛ den sɛ wɔde wɔn ani besi so
But the situation remains dire	Nanso tebea no da so ara yɛ hu
For a short time.	Bere tiaa bi.
I couldn’t really tell what he looked like most days	Na mintumi nhu sɛnea na ɔte nna dodow no ara ankasa
I have been trouble free ever since	Meyɛ obi a ɔhaw biara nni ho fi saa bere no
I just didn't want to react too quickly	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ ho ade ntɛmntɛm dodo ara kwa
I wanted us to be friends	Ná mepɛ sɛ yɛyɛ nnamfo
I had some things on me	Ná mewɔ nneɛma bi wɔ me so
However, it was no longer just about me.	Nanso, na ɛnyɛ me nkutoo ho asɛm bio.
I loved it whenever he did something amazing	Ná m’ani gye ho bere biara a ɔbɛyɛ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa no
He had done what he could.	Ná wayɛ nea obetumi.
I slip my hand into his	Mede me nsa hyɛ ne de mu
It’s hard for them maybe.	Ɛyɛ den ma wɔn ebia.
I loved seeing every single thing	Ná m’ani gye ho sɛ mihu ade biako biara
I think he has a point.	Misusuw sɛ ɔwɔ asɛm bi.
I knew my son.	Ná minim me ba no.
And many people do.	Na nnipa pii yɛ saa.
Not like him.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ ɔno.
It’s definitely great for us.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse ma yɛn.
Many of them were my friends.	Ná wɔn mu pii yɛ me nnamfo.
I couldn’t see him.	Na mintumi nhu no.
They stared hard at the back of the head.	Wɔde wɔn ani kyerɛɛ ti no akyi denneennen.
But he was not happy.	Nanso na anigye nni ne ho.
It is a pleasure for me to be with you today.	Ɛyɛ anigye ma me sɛ me ne mo wɔ hɔ nnɛ.
I understand hand and mouth now.	Mete ase nsa ne ano seesei.
I had an amazing car.	Ná mewɔ kar a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I may not know tomorrow	Ebia na minnim ɔkyena
Maybe we’ll do that.	Ebia yɛbɛyɛ saa.
You touch it with your hands.	Wode wo nsa ka.
I want to hear every story.	Mepɛ sɛ mete asɛm biara.
They have actually been taken away.	Wɔde wɔn akɔ ankasa.
But you know it.	Nanso wunim.
I told myself it was okay	Meka kyerɛɛ me ho sɛ ɛnyɛ hwee
But there was nothing he knew.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a na onim.
I was surprised by the great quality	Su kɛse no yɛɛ me nwonwa
I couldn't see very well	Ná mintumi nhu ade yiye koraa
I just wanted to be perfect for him	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ pɛ ma no ara kwa
I really think he is the one	Misusuw ankasa sɛ ɔno ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ no
Similar things happened over the next few years	Nneɛma a ɛte saa ara sii wɔ mfe kakraa a edi hɔ no mu
Whatever you have, give it away.	Biribiara a wowɔ no, fa ma.
But he wasn’t doing anything.	Nanso na ɔnyɛ hwee.
But this is not what happened.	Nanso ɛnyɛ eyi ne nea esii.
Maybe not much, but .	Ebia ɛnyɛ pii, nanso .
He could take care of that.	Ná obetumi ahwɛ saa asɛm no so.
And the situation, too.	Na tebea no nso.
I want to give you what you want	Mepɛ sɛ mede nea wopɛ ma wo
One time out of three, it works that way.	Bere biako wɔ abiɛsa mu no, ɛyɛ adwuma saa.
But it had come too late.	Nanso na aba akyiri dodo.
I will bring some clothes and stuff.	Mede ntade ne nneɛma bi bɛba.
The user as well.	Nea ɔde di dwuma no nso.
We could not have done such a good job.	Anka yɛrentumi nyɛ adwuma pa a ɛte saa.
That had been a reality.	Ná ɛno ayɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
I firmly believe that	Migye saa asɛm no di yiye
There is not much in it.	Nneɛma pii nni mu.
Language is a less talkative language.	Kasa yɛ kasa a ɛnyɛ kasa pii.
This time, this was happening every other week.	Saa bere yi, na eyi rekɔ so dapɛn abien biara.
This was a huge risk.	Ná eyi yɛ asiane kɛse.
There was no time to plan.	Ná bere biara nni hɔ a wɔde bɛyɛ nhyehyɛe.
She was a beautiful girl.	Ná ɔyɛ abeawa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Music.	Nnwom.
I set him well on his feet	Mede no sii ne nan so yiye
Things seemed to be missing.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea nneɛma nni hɔ.
I saw you in his arms	Mihuu wo wɔ ne nsa so
He saw her, too.	Ɔno nso huu no.
I just want to be free	Mepɛ sɛ mede me ho kɛkɛ
They are amazing.	Wɔyɛ nwonwa.
A little bit of the rest.	Kakraa bi a aka no.
I couldn’t, it was too late	Na mintumi, na aka akyi dodo
You can do nothing about it.	Wubetumi anyɛ ho hwee.
I’m really very impressed with him	M’ani agye ne ho kɛse ankasa
I have to sleep on this	Ɛsɛ sɛ meda eyi so
I saw the evil.	Mihuu bɔne.
This was an interesting day.	Ná eyi yɛ da a ɛyɛ anigye.
I wonder if you can help me	Misusuw sɛ ebia wubetumi aboa me anaa
This meeting is about my wife.	Saa nhyiam yi fa me yere ho.
It wasn’t just that.	Ná ɛnyɛ saa ara kwa.
I hope it was good	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ na ɛyɛ papa
I am not doing any of this stuff.	Ɛnyɛ me na mereyɛ saa nneɛma yi mu biara.
I know you can do the job	Minim sɛ wubetumi ayɛ adwuma no
I was never familiar with their game	Ná minnim wɔn agoru no yiye da
I didn't have to pretend anymore	Ná enhia sɛ meyɛ me ho sɛ meyɛ saa bio
For a short time, things were very difficult.	Wɔ bere tiaa bi mu no, na nneɛma mu yɛ den yiye.
I put everything aside	Mede biribiara too nkyɛn
Anything could be down there.	Biribiara betumi ayɛ nea ɛwɔ fam hɔ.
There is nothing good about it.	Biribiara a eye biara nni hɔ.
A man who seems to accidentally touch her	Ɔbarima bi a ɛte sɛ nea ɔde ne nsa ka no wɔ akwanhyia mu
The task was not difficult.	Ná adwuma no nyɛ den.
I want someone to know	Mepɛ sɛ obi hu
Maybe he had a fever or something.	Ebia na ne ho yɛ no hyew anaa biribi a ɛte saa.
Many of us do that.	Yɛn mu pii yɛ saa.
I never knew what it was.	Ná minnim nea ɛyɛ da.
I was always there	Ná mewɔ hɔ bere nyinaa
It’s all very quick and easy.	Ne nyinaa yɛ ntɛmntɛm yiye na ɛnyɛ den.
I couldn’t quite understand the meaning of his words	Na mintumi nte nea ne nsɛm no kyerɛ ase yiye
The focus group method was used.	Wɔde kuw a wɔde wɔn adwene sii so no kwan no dii dwuma.
We got to take you home.	Yɛn nsa kaa sɛ yɛde wo bɛkɔ fie.
I just couldn’t eat it.	Na mintumi nni kɛkɛ.
That was not the case with us.	Ná ɛnte saa wɔ yɛn fam.
If it is true.	Sɛ ɛyɛ nokware a.
Use it as you wish.	Fa di dwuma sɛnea wopɛ.
We are a formidable pair.	Yɛyɛ baanu a ɛyɛ hu.
I couldn’t believe how fast they were	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛnea na wɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm no
I can't help you much	Mintumi mmoa wo pii
I want my mother to go today	Mepɛ sɛ me maame kɔ nnɛ
He did things for them year in and year out.	Ɔyɛɛ nneɛma maa wɔn afe mu ne akyi.
I did put a boy out.	Mede abarimaa bi too abɔnten ampa.
I thought this was over with	Misusuwii sɛ eyi aba awiei ne
He was the one.	Ná ɔyɛ ɔno.
It was a long half-term.	Ná ɛyɛ fã bere tenten.
Maybe it was just that.	Ebia na ɛyɛ saa ara.
I know from his eyes what he plans to do	Minim fi n’ani so nea wayɛ nhyehyɛe sɛ ɔbɛyɛ
I think there is also water	Misusuw sɛ nsu nso wɔ hɔ
He always said that.	Ná ɔka saa bere nyinaa.
Usually one year.	Mpɛn pii no afe biako.
I have nothing to do today	Minni hwee yɛ nnɛ
They put in their time.	Wɔde wɔn bere hyɛ mu.
But there is one thing you might do.	Nanso ade biako wɔ hɔ a ebia wobɛyɛ.
The man was great.	Ná ɔbarima no yɛ kɛse.
It wasn’t scary at all	Ná ɛnyɛ hu koraa
That will be more difficult now.	Ɛno bɛyɛ den kɛse mprempren.
Another year of horror movies has come and gone.	Afe foforo a sini ahorow a ɛyɛ hu wom aba na atwam.
Not one of them knew about this.	Ná wɔn mu biako mpo nnim eyi ho asɛm.
This seems wrong to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea eyi yɛ mfomso wɔ me fam.
Go to your classroom.	Kɔ wo sukuu dan mu.
It was only for dinner.	Na ɛyɛ anwummere aduan nkutoo.
I couldn’t handle it anymore	Ná mintumi nni ho dwuma bio
I knew a part of me belonged to him	Ná minim sɛ me fã bi yɛ ne de
I wanted to know how much more lies were	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea atoro yɛ pii sen saa
I don’t have any children.	Minni mma biara.
I think of him tonight.	Misusuw ne ho anadwo yi.
The first evening.	Anwummere a edi kan no.
Which was exciting.	Nea na ɛyɛ anigye.
I just have to tell you	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo ara kwa
There is a great time for everyone	Bere kɛse bi wɔ hɔ a obiara wɔ
I had no real friends	Ná minni nnamfo ankasa biara
This is very easy to do.	Eyi yɛ mmerɛw yiye sɛ wobɛyɛ.
Or maybe it still is.	Anaasɛ ebia ɛda so ara te saa.
Or just any really big number.	Anaasɛ dodow kɛse biara ankasa kɛkɛ.
Which I only wish was perfect	Nea me yam a anka ɛyɛ nea edi mũ nkutoo
Take a closer look.	Hwɛ no yiye.
And what a good phone.	Na telefon pa bɛn ara ni.
Maybe not everything.	Ebia ɛnyɛ biribiara.
It was definitely loaded.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na wɔde nneɛma ahyɛ mu.
A great song.	Dwom kɛse bi.
I want the truth out	Mepɛ sɛ nokware no fi adi
I always had extra for the car	Ná mewɔ ka ho bere nyinaa ma kar no
I had high hopes that it would all work out	Na mewɔ anidaso kɛse sɛ ne nyinaa bɛyɛ yiye
He knew what the child was feeling.	Ná onim nea abofra no te nka.
But it shouldn’t be surprising.	Nanso ɛnsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nwonwa.
But this is still a dangerous group.	Nanso eyi da so ara yɛ kuw a asiane wom.
I was pretty good at it	Ná me ho akokwaw yiye wɔ mu
I know that might sound weird.	Minim sɛ ebia ɛno bɛyɛ te sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
The content is really great.	Nea ɛwɔ mu no yɛ kɛse ankasa.
But to me, this meant nothing.	Nanso wɔ me fam no, na eyi nkyerɛ hwee.
I can’t go through it anymore	Mintumi mfa mu bio
I think he’s a nice guy.	Misusuw sɛ ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I am another user.	Meyɛ obi foforo a mede di dwuma.
I don’t think anyone should have to live like that.	Minsusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ obiara tra ase saa.
I need a word with you too.	Me nso me hia asɛm bi a me ne wo bɛka.
I can’t even think of anything to say	Mintumi nsusuw biribi a mɛka ho mpo
A little bit really.	Kakraa bi ankasa.
It will be delivered in two hours.	Wɔde bɛma wɔ nnɔnhwerew abien akyi.
They were his children.	Ná wɔyɛ ne mma.
I love doing a lot of new and exciting things	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ nneɛma foforo pii a ɛyɛ anigye
The room was crowded.	Ná nnipa ahyɛ dan no mu ma.
If true, he didn’t have a car.	Sɛ ɛyɛ nokware a, na onni kar.
And yet not a boy.	Na nanso ɛnyɛ abarimaa.
It’s a few other things.	Ɛyɛ nneɛma foforo kakraa bi.
I want to hear more about this	Mepɛ sɛ mete eyi ho nsɛm pii
I shouldn’t have told him those things	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meka saa nsɛm no kyerɛ no
So, like the hat.	Enti, te sɛ kyɛw no.
I understood is the things he had to do	Metee ase ne nneɛma a na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ
He brings you into the situation.	Ɔde wo ba tebea no mu.
If you’re not in that, you don’t exist.	Sɛ wo nni saa mu a, wo nni hɔ.
I’m so excited about it	M’ani agye ho kɛse
Until, finally, finally.	Kosi sɛ, awiei koraa no, awiei koraa no.
I don’t care how pretty it was	Sɛnea na ɛyɛ fɛ no mfa me ho
They pretend to like you.	Wɔyɛ wɔn ho sɛ wɔn ani gye wo ho.
I want them to tell the truth.	Mepɛ sɛ wɔka nokware no.
I know how this story goes	Minim sɛnea saa asɛm yi kɔ so
I doubt it would be	Migye kyim sɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ saa
Apparently it was right then.	Ɛda adi sɛ na ɛte saa bere no ara pɛ.
That was what he wanted.	Ɛno ne nea na ɔpɛ.
I just want to see you both happy	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛ mo baanu nyinaa wɔ anigye ara kwa
They would all come down.	Ná wɔn nyinaa bɛba fam.
He is much worse.	Ɔyɛ bɔne sen saa koraa.
The big story just makes this easier.	Asɛm kɛse no ma eyi yɛ mmerɛw ara kwa.
It’s not like that anymore.	Ɛnyɛ saa bio.
I will give you their names if you think it necessary.	Mede wɔn din bɛma wo sɛ wususuw sɛ ɛho hia a.
The food is nothing.	Aduan no nyɛ hwee.
I think this gets easier with time	Misusuw sɛ eyi yɛ mmerɛw bere kɔ so no
And this is difficult.	Na eyi yɛ den.
I can’t leave well enough alone	Mintumi mfi hɔ yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ me nkutoo
For a long time.	Bere tenten bi.
All in all, my mind was okay.	Ne nyinaa mu no, na m’adwene nyɛ hwee.
The size of the game was the first issue	Ná agoru no kɛse yɛ asɛm a edi kan
The price was painful.	Bo no yɛɛ yaw.
I had no reason to feel that way	Ná minni biribiara a enti ɛsɛ sɛ mete nka saa
I just don’t understand	Me nte ase kɛkɛ
Tonight follows tomorrow, and then tonight.	Anadwo yi di ɔkyena akyi, na ɛno akyi anadwo yi.
And do it as soon as you think about it.	Na yɛ no bere a wususuw ho ara pɛ.
But it would look like him,’ he added.	Nanso anka ɛbɛyɛ te sɛ ɔno,’ ɔde kaa ho.
Tell me about that hair.	Ka saa nhwi no ho asɛm kyerɛ me.
It’s not that complicated.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ den saa.
I had to trust everyone	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ migye obiara di
That’s why we’re here.	Ɛno nti na yɛwɔ ha no.
I love being around them	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛka wɔn ho
I used things like .	Mede nneɛma te sɛ .
It used to be like that.	Ná ɛte saa kan.
This was our best face to date.	Ná eyi ne yɛn anim a eye sen biara a yɛde besi nnɛ.
I have organized many things for many people	Mayɛ nneɛma pii ho nhyehyɛe ama nnipa pii
Take off your shoes at the door.	Yi wo mpaboa wɔ ɔpon no ano.
I’m so glad you’re here.	M’ani agye yiye sɛ wowɔ ha.
Or maybe two.	Anaasɛ ebia abien.
It is not very important.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛho hia kɛse.
That’s why you are so perfect.	Ɛno nti na woyɛ pɛ saa no.
Many of his works can still be seen today	Ne nnwuma no pii da so ara tumi hu nnɛ
Working on interesting projects.	Nnwuma a ɛyɛ anigye a wɔyɛ ho adwuma.
It shouldn’t be talked about.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔka ho asɛm.
That was the truth.	Ná ɛno ne nokware no.
No one knows what he was like.	Obiara nnim sɛnea na ɔte.
I tell them that too	Me nso meka saa kyerɛ wɔn
He had no children.	Ná onni mma biara.
Many bad things happened to him.	Nneɛma bɔne pii too no.
I knew nothing about anything	Ná minnim hwee wɔ biribiara ho
Nothing fancy here, but everything is spectacular.	Biribiara nni ha a ɛyɛ fɛ, nanso biribiara yɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
But by then it was too late.	Nanso saa bere no na aka akyi dodo.
I wanted to keep doing that.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ saa.
Their fears were completely and utterly his.	Ná wɔn suro no yɛ ne de koraa na ɛyɛ ne de koraa.
He says I love that.	Ɔka sɛ m’ani gye saa asɛm no ho.
And look at his feet.	Na hwɛ ne nan.
I could have told you that	Anka metumi aka saa akyerɛ wo
And let the work be done.	Na ma adwuma no nyɛ.
At best, we have a day.	Sɛnea eye sen biara no, yɛwɔ da bi.
I hope we can work something out	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ yebetumi ayɛ adwuma bi
After all, there is more to the story	Ne nyinaa akyi no, nneɛma pii wɔ asɛm no mu
I want this done already	Mepɛ sɛ wɔyɛ eyi dedaw
Me and his wife.	Me ne ne yere.
I don't know how it will be.	Minnim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ.
His phone rings.	Ne telefon bɔ.
Whether it does anything is another matter.	Sɛ́ ebia ɛbɛyɛ biribi no yɛ asɛm foforo.
An opportunity has come to me.	Hokwan bi aba me nkyɛn.
It’s very complicated.	Ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den yiye.
You don’t have to tell me.	Ɛho nhia sɛ woka kyerɛ me.
I had to look at it with both eyes these days	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede m’ani abien nyinaa hwɛ no nnansa yi
I thought maybe you could.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia wubetumi ayɛ saa.
Nothing can do that.	Biribiara ntumi nyɛ saa.
I had to stay strong	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ den
But you can also use it for everything else.	Nanso wubetumi de adi dwuma wɔ biribiara a aka nso mu.
With him it’s no game.	Ne nkyɛn no ɛnyɛ agoru biara.
All I know is that he told me	Nea minim saa ara ne sɛ ɔka kyerɛɛ me
Still, he could eat himself a good lunch.	Nanso, na obetumi adi ne ho awia aduan pa.
People do get into it.	Nkurɔfo kɔ mu ampa.
I wanted to be like him	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne no yɛ pɛ
I give it to you for free.	Mede ma wo kwa.
I think you two would get along really well	Misusuw sɛ anka mo baanu no bɛbɔ yiye ankasa
No one ever really told me, but it was pretty obvious.	Obiara anka ankyerɛ me ankasa da, nanso na ɛda adi yiye.
There was a truth to them.	Na nokware bi wɔ hɔ ma wɔn.
Do it for them too.	Yɛ ma wɔn nso.
I want you to sign it	Mepɛ sɛ wode wo nsa hyɛ ase
So at least he’ll be happy.	Enti anyɛ yiye koraa no, n’ani begye.
Get rid of anything that doesn’t need to be there.	Yi biribiara a enhia sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ no fi adi.
No one wants to play with him.	Obiara mpɛ sɛ ɔne no bedi agoru.
That’s not how it works.	Ɛnyɛ saa na ɛyɛ adwuma.
It is quite possible that the book had nothing to do with anything.	Ɛyɛ yiye koraa sɛ na nhoma no ne biribiara nni hwee yɛ.
I had enough fun without you	Na mewɔ anigye a ɛdɔɔso a wo nka ho
I was exhausted.	Ná me ho ayɛ me hyew.
Which I know best.	Nea minim no yiye.
I really, really wanted to	Ná mepɛ ankasa, ankasa
It was a good day.	Ná ɛyɛ da pa.
It wasn’t really that.	Ná ɛnyɛ saa ankasa.
Many friends.	Nnamfo pii.
I just wanted to tell you	Na mepɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo ara kwa
I only know the things he tells me	Nneɛma a ɔka kyerɛ me nkutoo na minim
Better than too little	Eye sen sɛ ɛbɛyɛ kakraa bi dodo
We were only human beings	Ná yɛyɛ nnipa nkutoo
I feel really bad about that	Mete nka bɔne ankasa wɔ saa asɛm no ho
I forget why.	Me werɛ fi nea enti a ɛte saa.
This was a lot of fun.	Ná eyi yɛ anigye kɛse.
No hands, no legs.	Nsa biara nni hɔ, nan biara nni hɔ.
That lunch you took me to.	Saa awia aduan a wode me kɔɔ hɔ no.
She was most beautiful then.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ sen biara saa bere no.
I think it’s a significant number	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ dodow a ɛho hia
I was on the sidelines	Ná me na mewɔ nkyɛn
I could use more of this.	Ná metumi de eyi mu pii adi dwuma.
I include him in them.	Me de no ka wɔn ho.
I know who you are	Minim onipa a woyɛ no
It was amazing how well this worked.	Ná ɛyɛ nwonwa sɛnea eyi yɛɛ adwuma yiye no.
I just hoped it would work	Ná mewɔ anidaso ara kwa sɛ ɛbɛyɛ adwuma
They seemed to like his past.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea wɔn ani gye ne kan no ho.
I know my mom like the back of my hand	Minim me maame te sɛ me nsa akyi
However, it is not really true.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nokware ankasa.
Now they have to do it.	Seesei ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
I hadn’t thought about any of that	Ná minsusuw saa nneɛma no mu biara ho
I just can’t see myself doing it	Mintumi nhu me ho ara kwa sɛ mereyɛ
I can handle it for a few more days	Metumi adi ho dwuma nna kakraa bi bio
It must be pretty much him doing that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ fɛ yiye a ɔreyɛ saa.
Everyone else wants the best.	Obiara a aka no pɛ sɛ ɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
I am as bad as any of you	Meyɛ bɔne te sɛ mo mu biara
Everything and everyone matters.	Biribiara ne obiara ho hia.
I had nothing to do this with	Ná minni biribiara a mɛyɛ eyi
And I hope you have something else to offer me	Na mewɔ anidaso sɛ wowɔ biribi foforo a wode bɛma me
It would have been.	Anka ɛbɛyɛ saa.
Most of us enjoy sex.	Yɛn mu dodow no ara ani gye nna ho.
If you don’t want to.	Sɛ wompɛ a.
I was always me at this meeting	Na meyɛ me wɔ saa nhyiam yi ase bere nyinaa
On his words.	Wɔ ne nsɛm so.
That’s a car that people seem to have associated with a lot.	Ɛno yɛ kar a ɛte sɛ nea nkurɔfo ne no abɔ pii.
It was a wonderful story.	Ná ɛyɛ asɛm a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I can’t tell you for sure	Mintumi nka nkyerɛ wo yiye
That was a lot of money.	Ná ɛno yɛ sika kɛse.
I saw that right away	Mihuu saa ntɛm ara
I would go for a walk.	Ná mekɔ nantew.
Go ahead, take it.	Kɔ so, fa no.
I told you the best don’t cost that much	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ nea eye sen biara no nnye sika pii saa
He didn't want this to happen.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ eyi ba.
I couldn't believe he was really mine	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛ ɔyɛ me de ankasa
I was just another face among many	Ná meyɛ anim foforo ara kwa wɔ nnipa pii mu
The song was a huge success	Dwom no dii yiye kɛse
So that was an accident.	Enti na ɛno yɛ akwanhyia.
But there is nothing left for you here.	Nanso biribiara nni hɔ a aka ama wo wɔ ha.
Everything else looks.	Biribiara a aka no hwɛ.
We would have been better off.	Anka yɛbɛyɛ yiye.
I can pretty much do anything here	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ metumi ayɛ biribiara wɔ ha
Assume the claim is true.	Fa no sɛ asɛm a wɔka no yɛ nokware.
The story is not true.	Asɛm no nyɛ nokware.
It’s a really easy job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ mmerɛw ankasa.
To say more at this point would be saying too much.	Sɛ́ wobɛka pii wɔ saa bere yi mu no bɛyɛ sɛ wobɛka pii dodo.
There is not one job left.	Adwuma biako mpo nni hɔ a aka.
I moved on with myself.	Mede me ho kɔɔ so.
I told him not to forget	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ne werɛ mfi
He is the only person who can be honest.	Ɔno nkutoo ne onipa a obetumi adi nokware.
I thank him for my life	Meda no ase wɔ me nkwa ho
First of all, older people are scarce.	Nea edi kan koraa no, nnipa a wɔn mfe akɔ anim ho yɛ na.
At least I couldn’t go until the next day.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, na mintumi nkɔ kosi da a edi hɔ no.
And maybe it was, just a little bit.	Na ebia na ɛte saa, kakra bi kɛkɛ.
It’s too soon though.	Ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo nanso.
They looked almost identical.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na wɔn ho yɛ pɛ.
I love those moments when he is completely inside me	M’ani gye saa bere a ɔte me mu koraa no ho
Whether it’s true or not really doesn’t matter.	Sɛ́ ɛyɛ nokware anaasɛ ɛnte saa no mfa ho ankasa.
They are extremely fast and always on time.	Wɔyɛ ntɛmntɛm koraa na wɔyɛ bere ano bere nyinaa.
It would just be more expensive.	Anka ne bo bɛyɛ den kɛse ara kwa.
It does work.	Ɛyɛ adwuma ampa.
It was too expensive for them.	Ná ne bo yɛ den dodo ma wɔn.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Ebia, ebia, ebia.
In the end, it would be for the best.	Awiei koraa no, na ɛbɛyɛ nea eye sen biara.
I have been all day and he knew nothing	Mayɛ da mũ nyinaa a na onnim hwee
This time, he has done it.	Saa bere yi de, wayɛ.
Your head is clearer than his.	Wo ti mu da hɔ sen ne de no.
People are beautiful.	Nkurɔfo ho yɛ fɛ.
I didn’t even know his name, but that didn’t matter	Ná minnim ne din mpo, nanso na ɛno ho nhia
The same thing will happen.	Saa ara na ɛbɛyɛ.
I have been putting it on lately.	Mede ahyɛ so nnansa yi.
He has to be successful this year or go under.	Ɛsɛ sɛ odi yiye afe yi anaasɛ ɔbɛkɔ ase.
You.	Wo.
That is just one point.	Ɛno yɛ asɛm biako pɛ.
I had never forgotten him	Ná me werɛ mfi ne da
I could have just shot you.	Anka metumi ayɛ wo tuo kɛkɛ.
A boy here, a girl there.	Abarimaa bi wɔ ha, abeawa bi wɔ hɔ.
This can mean two things.	Eyi betumi akyerɛ nneɛma abien.
Just do whatever works for you.	Yɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ adwuma ama wo biara kɛkɛ.
I really like the idea behind this presentation	M’ani gye adwene a ɛwɔ saa nsɛm a wɔde bɛma yi akyi no ho ankasa
They had never done it themselves.	Ná wɔn ankasa nso nyɛɛ saa da.
It was too early for the trailer.	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo ma kar a wɔde fa nnipa no.
At least not him.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ ɔno.
I know a lot of people	Minim nnipa pii
I had nothing to do with him.	Ná me ne no nni hwee yɛ.
A really bad night.	Anadwo bɔne ankasa.
I still can, you know	Meda so ara tumi, wunim
I have no idea what this could be	Minni nea eyi betumi ayɛ ho adwene biara
He is young and has some power.	Ɔyɛ abofra na ɔwɔ tumi bi.
I can’t feel the cold	Mintumi nte awɔw no nka
I have such high hopes	Mewɔ anidaso kɛse a ɛte saa
They are just wonderful people.	Wɔyɛ nnipa a wɔn ho yɛ nwonwa ara kwa.
I’m a fan of water.	M’ani gye nsu ho.
But when he did, it was all in.	Nanso bere a ɔyɛɛ saa no, na ne nyinaa ahyɛ mu.
That is a meeting of innovation.	Ɛno yɛ nneɛma foforo ho nhyiam.
Never think of it that way.	Mma nsusuw ho saa da.
Naturally there is a danger.	Sɛnea ɛte no asiane bi wɔ hɔ.
I couldn’t say the words	Na mintumi nka nsɛm no
Well, why not.	Ampa, dɛn nti na ɛnte saa.
For him, immediately.	Wɔ ne fam no, ntɛm ara.
The gun is actually quite simple.	Tuo no yɛ mmerɛw koraa ankasa.
I knew him better than anyone	Ná minim no yiye sen obiara
I care about this city.	Kurow yi ho asɛm hia me.
I just have to do something	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi kɛkɛ
Nothing else that night.	Biribiara nni hɔ bio saa anadwo no.
I know it’s true	Minim sɛ ɛyɛ nokware
I find this very strange	Mihu sɛ eyi yɛ nwonwa yiye
I didn’t have time for this	Na minni bere mma eyi
I wanted to know everything better.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu biribiara yiye.
We have a lot of things to do.	Yɛwɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ.
I wondered what it was like	Misusuw sɛnea ɛte no ho
I really liked that idea.	M’ani gyee saa adwene no ho yiye.
I am a child.	Meyɛ abofra.
People looked at them.	Nkurɔfo hwɛɛ wɔn.
I can’t believe it was all an accident	Mintumi nnye nni sɛ na ne nyinaa yɛ akwanhyia
I believe we are a good team	Migye di sɛ yɛyɛ kuw pa
This is not possible.	Eyi ntumi nyɛ yiye.
He was very skilled.	Ná ne ho akokwaw yiye.
He certainly doesn’t.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
I know people.	Minim nnipa.
It is certainly temporary.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi.
That’s what a team does	Ɛno ne nea kuw bi yɛ
He is a beautiful man.	Ɔyɛ onipa a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I had already dated most of them	Ná me ne wɔn mu dodow no ara abɔ dedaw
I could do that in my sleep	Ná metumi ayɛ saa adwuma no wɔ me nna mu
I should have known this would happen	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu sɛ eyi bɛba
The real thing.	Asɛm ankasa.
Overall it’s a good shot.	Ne nyinaa mu no ɛyɛ tuo pa.
I was once one of them	Bere bi na meyɛ wɔn mu biako
Every living person does.	Obi a ɔte ase biara yɛ saa.
I will attach this picture	Mede mfonini yi bɛka ho
I could have told you anytime	Anka metumi aka akyerɛ wo bere biara
At the time I didn’t know what it was	Saa bere no na minnim nea ɛyɛ
But good news.	Nanso asɛm pa.
There is no such thing.	Ade biara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
Every child had to be on the team.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ abofra biara ka kuw no ho.
You know he doesn’t.	Wunim sɛ ɔnyɛ saa.
I used to be beautiful	Kan no na me ho yɛ fɛ
If something is too easy, make it harder.	Sɛ biribi yɛ mmerɛw dodo a, ma ɛnyɛ den.
And not just because she’s beautiful.	Na ɛnyɛ sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ nkutoo nti.
I shouldn’t have gone there	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mekɔ hɔ
But he could do both.	Nanso na obetumi ayɛ abien no nyinaa.
That is not possible.	Ɛno ntumi nyɛ yiye.
This is not entirely true.	Eyi nyɛ nokware koraa.
My hands work well.	Me nsa yɛ adwuma yiye.
He's on the road somewhere.	Ɔwɔ kwan so wɔ baabi.
I know exactly how he feels about this	Minim sɛnea ɔte nka wɔ asɛm yi ho no yiye
I had to get to know him better	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no yiye
In a sense, it was placed in the group.	Wɔ ɔkwan bi so no, wɔde sii kuw no mu.
I really wonder how true that is.	Misusuw sɛnea ɛno yɛ nokware no ho ankasa.
Plenty of time to do so.	Bere pii a wɔde bɛyɛ saa.
I was good at all three	Ná me ho akokwaw wɔ abiɛsa no nyinaa mu
It doesn’t seem to be.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ saa.
But we all know he will too.	Nanso yɛn nyinaa nim sɛ ɔno nso bɛyɛ saa.
That worked before.	Ɛno yɛɛ adwuma kan.
I can name names if you like	Metumi abɔ din ahorow sɛ wopɛ a
I believe that less is more.	Migye di sɛ kakraa bi na ɛdɔɔso.
I am not a nobody.	Menyɛ obiara.
The test is over.	Sɔhwɛ no aba awiei.
He wanted the old me and the old us.	Ná ɔpɛ me dedaw no ne yɛn dedaw no.
I totally disagree with him	Me ne no nyɛ adwene koraa
I'm right here with you	Me ne wo wɔ ha yi ara
You know what these things are like.	Wunim sɛnea saa nneɛma yi te.
You can put it any way you want.	Wubetumi de ahyɛ ɔkwan biara a wopɛ so.
I used that statement	Mede saa asɛm no dii dwuma
There are two reasons for this.	Nneɛma abien nti na ɛte saa.
I think he's hooked on me	Misusuw sɛ ɔde ne ho ahyɛ me mu
He was on the phone.	Ná ɔwɔ telefon so.
It’s empty of anything.	Ɛyɛ nea biribiara nni mu.
Or did he do that.	Anaasɛ ɔyɛɛ saa.
It’s all water.	Ne nyinaa yɛ nsu.
Three years ago.	Mfe abiɛsa a atwam ni.
He truly wants the best for you.	Ɔpɛ nea eye sen biara ma wo ampa.
I never want him to put me down	Mempɛ sɛ ɔde me to fam da
Lots of power to him.	Tumi pii ma no.
Mine was terrible.	Ná me de no yɛ hu yiye.
I couldn’t handle something like that	Ná mintumi nni biribi a ɛte saa ho dwuma
Not putting them first.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ wode wɔn bedi kan.
He is perhaps one of the most important elements of this book.	Ebia ɔyɛ nhoma yi mu nneɛma a ɛho hia sen biara no mu biako.
I have to feed myself with them	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede wɔn ma me ho aduan
All of these things were not working.	Ná saa nneɛma yi nyinaa ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
I have a number of them.	Mewɔ dodow bi.
I still remember him playing with me when I was a kid	Meda so ara kae sɛ na ɔne me di agoru bere a na meyɛ abofra no
See, this is the thing.	Hwɛ, eyi ne ade no.
And it probably isn’t.	Na ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
I should have looked	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ
I have scheduled it.	Mede ayɛ ho nhyehyɛe.
I knew about it.	Ná minim ho asɛm.
I would appreciate any help.	M’ani begye mmoa biara a wɔde bɛma no ho.
He gave me a smile.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ me.
I just love the work.	Adwuma no nkutoo na m’ani gye ho.
I really think about that	Misusuw saa asɛm no ho ankasa
He will be our age.	Ɔno bɛyɛ yɛn mfe no mu.
That’s also amazing.	Ɛno nso yɛ nwonwa.
But it may not be.	Nanso ebia ɛnyɛ saa.
His wife knew too.	Ná ne yere nso nim.
I should have introduced you sooner	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mede wo kyerɛ ntɛm ara
It’s easy and fun.	Ɛyɛ mmerɛw na ɛyɛ anigye.
I put my book down.	Mede me nhoma no too hɔ.
It’s just for people to have fun.	Ɛyɛ sɛ nkurɔfo begye wɔn ani kɛkɛ.
I was supposed to have nothing	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ minni hwee
I know it would be a lot of people	Minim sɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ nnipa pii
You don’t have to do that either.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ wo nso woyɛ saa.
I wanted to talk to him	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa
I just had no idea how amazing it was	Ná minnim sɛnea ɛyɛ nwonwa no ho adwene biara kɛkɛ
All you have is things that people do.	Nea wowɔ ara ne nneɛma a nkurɔfo yɛ.
So it’s not much of a surprise on that front.	Enti ɛnyɛ nwonwa kɛse wɔ saa anim no.
Not since last week.	Ɛnyɛ fi dapɛn a etwaam no.
I can’t do this anymore	Mintumi nyɛ eyi bio
The girl really worked.	Ná abeawa no yɛ adwuma ankasa.
I thought you knew this story	Misusuwii sɛ wunim saa asɛm yi
I've brought the mouth	Mede ano aba
No wonder his mother couldn’t talk about it.	Ɛnyɛ nwonwa sɛ na ne maame ntumi nka ho asɛm.
Or what’s left of him, anyway.	Anaasɛ nea aka wɔ ne ho, ɔkwan biara so.
Both systems look good.	Nhyehyɛe abien no nyinaa hwɛ yiye.
I had the same idea	Ná mewɔ adwene koro no ara
That’s what plans are like.	Saa na nhyehyɛe ahorow te.
It’s going too far.	Ɛrekɔ akyiri dodo.
I like to focus on painting time	M’ani gye ho sɛ mede m’adwene besi bere a mede bɛyɛ mfonini so
And I have a good point for that too	Na mewɔ asɛm pa bi ma ɛno nso
It seems to be a real book.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nhoma ankasa.
He did know it.	Ná onim ampa.
I take care of it, as hard as it is	Mehwɛ so, sɛnea ɛyɛ den no
I should have seen it sooner	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mihu no ntɛm
And not that long ago.	Na ɛnyɛ bere tenten ni saa.
He was everything.	Ná ɔyɛ biribiara.
I thought he might do that for a while.	Misusuwii sɛ ebia ɔbɛyɛ saa bere tiaa bi.
If it was wrong in some way.	Sɛ na ɛyɛ mfomso wɔ ɔkwan bi so a.
I had nothing else to do	Ná minni biribi foforo biara a mɛyɛ
Heat until just warm to the touch.	Fa hyew kosi sɛ ɛbɛyɛ hyew ara kwa sɛ wode wo nsa bɛka.
The house has private parking.	Ofie no wɔ baabi a obiara betumi de kar asi.
But not this week.	Nanso ɛnyɛ dapɛn yi.
I could see this all day	Ná metumi ahu eyi da mũ nyinaa
I almost feel like my old self	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mete nka sɛ me ho dedaw no
Outside, the cold touched me.	Wɔ abɔnten no, awɔw no kaa me.
What is going on?.	Dɛn na ɛrekɔ so?.
There were people down here, too.	Na nnipa wɔ ha ase, nso.
I have a plan for that	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe bi a mede bɛyɛ saa
I know what you meant	Minim nea na wopɛ sɛ woka
I use them to no avail	Mede wɔn di dwuma ma ɛnyɛ yiye koraa
I just didn’t want to be late	Ná mempɛ sɛ mɛka akyi kɛkɛ
That wasn’t what I meant.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea mepɛ sɛ meka.
You definitely need to do something with your hair.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ wode wo ti nhwi yɛ biribi.
Should it be hard on, use it.	Sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ den wɔ, fa di dwuma.
I didn’t need to be with someone like him	Ná enhia sɛ me ne obi te sɛ ɔno bɔ
that works with me.	ɛno ne me yɛ adwuma.
I didn’t want to like it	Ná mempɛ sɛ m’ani gye ho
That’s nothing at all.	Ɛno nyɛ hwee koraa.
I really can’t imagine you	Ankasa mintumi nsusuw wo ho
Don’t be like me.	Mma wonyɛ sɛ me.
There is nothing like them.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ wɔn.
It seems kind of dangerous.	Ɛte sɛ nea asiane wom bi.
I'm not quite sure it's more than that.	Me nnim koraa sɛ ɛdɔɔso sen saa.
It should be easy enough.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ.
Like her mother.	Te sɛ ne maame.
Much has happened since then	Pii asi fi saa bere no
I was the only hope for them	Ná me nkutoo na mewɔ anidaso ma wɔn
You may know a few.	Ebia wunim kakraa bi.
It works pretty much the same way.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma saa ara.
The more realistic the images are, the less real they are.	Dodow a wɔyɛ mfonini ahorow no ankasa no, dodow no ara na ɛnyɛ nokware.
Maybe I could save them	Ebia na metumi agye wɔn nkwa
The truth is one truth.	Nokware no yɛ nokware biako.
Sounds good to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye ma me.
Or at least the last he knew of.	Anaasɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, nea etwa to a na onim ho asɛm no.
I knew then that at least part of it was out.	Saa bere no na minim sɛ anyɛ yiye koraa no, ne fã bi afi adi.
But that was an accident.	Nanso na ɛno yɛ akwanhyia.
Alright? 	Ɛyɛ?
I have to lay my hands on you	Ɛsɛ sɛ mede me nsa to wo so
I’ll be very happy with it.	M’ani begye ho paa.
We have a man on the ground.	Yɛwɔ ɔbarima bi a ɛwɔ fam.
This just makes it worse.	Eyi ma ɛyɛ kɛse ara kwa.
It was terrifying, absolutely terrifying.	Ná ɛyɛ hu, na ɛyɛ hu koraa.
I didn’t even know	Ná minnim mpo
They were both beautiful.	Ná wɔn baanu nyinaa ho yɛ fɛ.
My legs give it first.	Me nan na edi kan de ma.
I should have figured this out a long time ago	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw eyi ho bere tenten a atwam ni
There is a lot of money.	Sika pii wɔ hɔ.
He did the same for her.	Ɔyɛɛ saa ara maa no.
He was just doing something for himself in his time.	Ná ɔreyɛ biribi ama ne ho ara kwa wɔ ne bere so.
Put yourself in danger.	Fa wo ho to asiane mu.
I had food and water	Ná mewɔ aduan ne nsu
Trust what you know.	Fa wo ho to nea wunim no so.
That’s your part.	Ɛno ne wo fã.
He has no idea what that will cost.	Onni nea ɛno bɛbɔ ka ho adwene biara.
It’s beautiful and simple.	Ɛyɛ fɛ na ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I saw that one.	Mihuu saa biako no.
I still feel for him	Meda so ara te nka wɔ ne ho
These two were friends.	Ná saa baanu yi yɛ nnamfo.
Anyway, if he was, it didn't work.	Sɛnea ɛte biara no, sɛ na ɔyɛ saa a, na ɛnyɛ adwuma.
People are afraid of him.	Nkurɔfo suro no.
I couldn’t work for days	Ná mintumi nyɛ adwuma nna pii
I was part of his group	Ná meka ne kuw no ho
He wants it to work.	Ɔpɛ sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma.
He was a normal person.	Ná ɔyɛ obi a ɔte ase.
Which I just wanted to know more about you	Nea na mepɛ sɛ mihu wo ho nsɛm pii ara kwa
And believe it.	Na gye di.
The language looks good to me.	Kasa no hwɛ yiye ma me.
So is he, too.	Ɔno nso te saa.
He can do whatever he wants.	Obetumi ayɛ nea ɔpɛ biara.
I can give you anything you want, you know	Metumi ama wo biribiara a wopɛ, wunim
As you can see, most users use it in the first few days.	Sɛnea wubetumi ahu no, wɔn a wɔde di dwuma wɔ nna kakraa a edi kan no mu dodow no ara de di dwuma.
He really just wants the best for me.	Ɔpɛ nea eye sen biara ma me ara kwa ankasa.
A man had a gun pointed at my head	Ná ɔbarima bi de tuo bi akyerɛ me ti
Maybe I should apologize	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ mepa kyɛw
But that doesn’t begin to tell the whole story.	Nanso ɛno mfi ase nka asɛm no nyinaa.
I had forgotten how beautiful this trail was	Ná me werɛ afi sɛnea na saa kwan yi yɛ fɛ no
And in a sense, they were.	Na ɔkwan bi so no, na wɔyɛ saa.
A beautiful day.	Da a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Better than anyone else.	Ɛyɛ papa sen obiara.
His eyes are bright.	N’ani so da hɔ.
I do this every morning	Meyɛ eyi anɔpa biara
That’s a significant majority.	Ɛno yɛ dodow no ara a ɛho hia.
And two, this wasn’t one of his kind.	Na abien, na eyi nyɛ ne su mu biako.
No one had ever done that before.	Ná obiara nyɛɛ saa da.
I didn't have that one	Ná minni saa biako no
It is not installed.	Ɛnyɛ nea wɔde ahyɛ mu.
Thus, we can proceed as if in .	Enti, yebetumi akɔ so te sɛ nea ɛwɔ .
No one knew much about him.	Ná obiara nnim ne ho nsɛm pii.
That thought made her feel a little better.	Saa adwene no maa ne ho tɔɔ no kakra.
They are certainly beautiful.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ wɔn ho yɛ fɛ.
But you also need to have some fun.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ wugye w’ani kakra nso.
Hope it’s a girl.	Anidaso sɛ ɛyɛ abeawa bi.
This happens later in the new house.	Eyi ba akyiri yi wɔ ofie foforo no mu.
That is our way.	Ɛno ne yɛn kwan.
It doesn’t lie to you	Ɛnyɛ atoro nkyerɛ wo
Smooth facial features.	Anim a ɛyɛ mmerɛw a ɛwɔ anim a ɛyɛ mmerɛw.
Or who, if you must.	Anaasɛ hena, sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ a.
We are children.	Yɛyɛ mmofra.
Or none at all.	Anaasɛ biara nni hɔ koraa.
Again, it was a dysfunction.	Bio nso, na ɛyɛ adwuma a ɛnyɛ adwuma.
All I know is that it is not true	Nea minim ara ne sɛ ɛnyɛ nokware
I can hardly believe it	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ mintumi nnye nni
I know it sounds weird.	Minim sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I hope he is doing well	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔreyɛ yiye
I really enjoyed it	M’ani gyee ho ankasa
Know that we are of one mind.	Hu sɛ yɛyɛ adwene biako pɛ.
How vulnerable they were.	Hwɛ sɛnea na wɔyɛ mmerɛw.
I couldn’t go any further	Na mintumi nkɔ akyiri bio
Talk for as long as you like.	Kasa bere tenten biara a wopɛ.
I totally understand that.	Mete saa asɛm no ase koraa.
I will do something with them one day.	Mede wɔn bɛyɛ biribi da bi.
I don’t even have to talk to you	Ɛnsɛ sɛ me ne wo kasa mpo
What is happening is quite obvious.	Nea ɛrekɔ so no da adi koraa.
Watch it going on.	Hwɛ rekɔ so.
I included your mother	Mede wo maame kaa ho
But that is highly unlikely.	Nanso ɛno nyɛ nea ɛbɛyɛ yiye koraa.
And yet here we are.	Na nanso yɛwɔ ha.
And at home, it still is.	Na wɔ fie no, ɛda so ara yɛ saa.
His presence forced us to pay attention.	Ne ba a na ɔwɔ hɔ no hyɛɛ yɛn sɛ yɛde yɛn adwene besi so.
I hope you might enjoy it	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ebia w’ani begye ho
I can't deal with this right now	Mintumi nni eyi ho dwuma mprempren
The simpler the better.	Dodow a ɛyɛ mmerɛw no, dodow no ara na eye.
I hope you enjoy it this way.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho wɔ saa kwan yi so.
I want to be really good	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nea eye ankasa
I could barely see him	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nhu no
I'm with you.	Me ne wo.
I wonder what he is really doing	Misusuw nea ɔreyɛ ankasa ho
This is my gun.	Eyi ne me tuo.
This is a great move.	Eyi yɛ ade kɛse a wɔde tu mmirika.
That has to happen.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ba.
He should have gone with them.	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ ɔne wɔn kɔ.
He will be fine.	Ɔbɛyɛ yiye.
The more painful the better.	Nea ɛyɛ yaw sen biara no na eye sen biara.
You know, you know.	Wunim, wunim.
Stay just a moment, he told himself.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ ne ho sɛ, tra hɔ bere tiaa bi pɛ.
He was here, finally.	Ná ɔwɔ ha, awiei koraa no.
I thought he liked it	Misusuwii sɛ na n’ani gye ho
That surprised me	Ɛno yɛɛ me nwonwa
I love the tests	M’ani gye sɔhwɛ ahorow no ho
What you don’t know is why.	Nea wunnim ne nea enti a ɛte saa.
Raise your hands a little more.	Ma wo nsa so kakra bio.
I was away from home for the past few days.	Ná minni fie nna kakraa a atwam no.
That is a difficult task.	Ɛno yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ den.
It was a bit warm, though.	Nanso, na ɛyɛ hyew kakra.
I love true friends along with me someone	M’ani gye nokware nnamfo ho ka me obi ho
I want to do something	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ biribi
That was the way it was.	Saa na na ɛte.
That idea is amazing.	Saa adwene no yɛ nwonwa.
We need to be told what really happened here.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔka nea esii wɔ ha ankasa kyerɛ yɛn.
I have a better way.	Mewɔ ɔkwan a eye sen saa.
This idea is new and very exciting.	Saa adwene yi yɛ foforo na ɛyɛ anigye kɛse.
That was about a year ago.	Ɛno yɛ bɛyɛ afe a atwam ni.
Consider two such viewpoints.	Susuw adwene abien a ɛte saa ho hwɛ.
I know you better than you know yourself	Minim wo yiye sen sɛnea wunim wo ho
No one knew what that meant.	Ná obiara nnim nea ɛno kyerɛ.
That’s what happened.	Ɛno ne nea esii.
At least we can’t do that.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, yɛrentumi nyɛ saa.
Time doesn’t give anything.	Bere mfa hwee mma.
We can’t do it anymore.	Yɛrentumi bio.
I want to spend some time on that	Mepɛ sɛ mede bere kakra yɛ saa asɛm no
I can’t imagine what it’s like now.	Mintumi nsusuw sɛnea ɛte mprempren no ho.
I am in trouble.	Mewɔ ɔhaw mu.
That seems to be .	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛno yɛ .
He didn’t seem to have any problems.	Ɛte sɛ nea na onni ɔhaw biara.
They trusted him.	Wɔde ne ho too no so.
Check it out!.	Hwɛ so!.
I didn’t know it existed	Ná minnim sɛ ɛwɔ hɔ
Not everyone wanted to do that.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa.
Maybe he didn’t.	Ebia na ɔnyɛ saa.
I did the same then as I do now	Saa bere no na meyɛɛ saa ara sɛnea ɛte mprempren no
I knew where that would take me	Ná minim baabi a ɛno de me bɛkɔ
I wasn’t feeling well at all	Ná me ho nyɛ me den koraa
I loved that dress, though	Ná m’ani gye saa atade no ho, nanso
It doesn’t have to be that hard.	Ɛho nhia sɛ ɛyɛ den saa.
And I hope we can try, you know	Na mewɔ anidaso sɛ yebetumi abɔ mmɔden, wunim
He may have already done it.	Ebia na wayɛ dedaw.
Maybe tonight or tomorrow.	Ebia anadwo yi anaa ɔkyena.
I have a problem with this	Mewɔ ɔhaw bi wɔ eyi ho
I have seen him with my two eyes	Mede m’ani abien ahu no
I have to do that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa.
I think that’s what he was doing	Misusuw sɛ ɛno ne nea na ɔreyɛ
I thought he wanted it this way	Misusuwii sɛ ɔpɛ saa kwan yi so
In the recent past.	Nnansa yi bere a atwam no.
I include them here for perspective.	Mede wɔn ka ho wɔ ha ma adwene.
We can talk about both.	Yebetumi aka abien no nyinaa ho asɛm.
But you know your father.	Nanso wunim wo papa.
It was important to him.	Ná ɛho hia no.
However, I still had no feelings for him	Nanso, na meda so ara nte nka biara mma no
And it seemed to work.	Na ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ adwuma.
Words are power.	Nsɛm yɛ tumi.
I had some things on me.	Ná mewɔ nneɛma bi wɔ me so.
Think about it	Adwene ne ho .
I want you to see him.	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu no.
I didn’t even really look like me in this outfit	Na menyɛ sɛ me mpo ankasa wɔ saa atade yi mu
Usually you do.	Mpɛn pii no, woyɛ saa.
This goes on living.	Eyi kɔ so tra ase.
I couldn’t feel anything	Ná mintumi nte biribiara nka
Faster than you are.	Ntɛmntɛm sen wo.
But two could play in this game	Nanso na baanu betumi adi agoru wɔ saa agoru yi mu
I had to hear it all	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mete ne nyinaa
In a way, I know him	Ɔkwan bi so no, minim no
So if so, they are interested.	Enti sɛ ɛte saa a, wɔn ani gye ho.
There are other things there too.	Nneɛma foforo bi wɔ hɔ nso wɔ hɔ.
No one saw any cars or people.	Obiara anhu kar anaa nnipa biara.
It was just too exciting.	Ná ɛyɛ anigye dodo ara kwa.
I want to play with him	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no di agoru
I just want to know about it and stuff	Mepɛ sɛ mihu ho asɛm ne nneɛma bi kɛkɛ
I didn’t know it was that bad	Ná minnim sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne saa
Look at the paper.	Hwɛ krataa so.
I really want you to go with me tonight.	Mepɛ sɛ wo ne me kɔ anadwo yi ankasa.
But you never know with us.	Nanso wo ne yɛn nnim da.
I headed for my car	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ me kar no ho
However, I believe it all	Nanso, migye ne nyinaa di
And that was quite interesting	Na ɛno yɛ anigye koraa
I never wanted to be good	Na mempɛ sɛ meyɛ papa da
You have the story.	Wowɔ asɛm no.
But the point is, is that this is hard.	Nanso asɛm no ne sɛ, ne sɛ eyi yɛ den.
It looked like it might be interesting.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ebia ɛbɛyɛ anigye.
I want you to be my wife one day	Mepɛ sɛ woyɛ me yere da bi
And some ground vehicles.	Na kar ahorow bi a wɔde fa fam nso.
It’s hard, and it’s very hard.	Ɛyɛ den, na ɛyɛ den yiye.
He loved to play a lot with the kids.	Ná n’ani gye ho sɛ ɔne mmofra no bedi agoru pii.
I didn’t have time to tell the man	Na minni bere a mede bɛka akyerɛ ɔbarima no
But we are here.	Nanso yɛwɔ ha.
You have to work on that.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ adwuma wɔ saa asɛm no ho.
He is.	Ɔyɛ.
We just can’t do that.	Yɛrentumi nyɛ saa ara kwa.
You can do it.	Wubetumi ayɛ.
Time and he still have a say in that.	Bere ne ɔno asɛm da so ara wɔ nea ɛno so.
He says he doesn’t know.	Ɔka sɛ onnim.
I hoped it would be him	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛbɛyɛ ɔno
I had forgotten about the boy	Ná me werɛ afi abarimaa no ho asɛm
It’s a musical thing.	Ɛyɛ nnwom mu ade.
Most of us have seen this.	Yɛn mu dodow no ara ahu eyi.
It’s not happening.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛrekɔ so.
I took him to the car.	Mede no kɔɔ kar no mu.
I know how hard this must be for you	Minim sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ sɛ eyi yɛ den ma mo
I just love this time of year.	M’ani gye afe no mu bere yi ho ara kwa.
I couldn’t figure out what it was like	Na mintumi nhu sɛnea na ɛte
I hope for better things	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ nneɛma pa bɛba
No one said a word.	Obiara anka asɛm biako mpo.
But tomorrow is another day.	Nanso ɔkyena yɛ da foforo.
There was no paper inside.	Ná krataa biara nni mu.
I couldn’t tell anyone	Na mintumi nka nkyerɛ obiara
So are the two of you.	Saa ara na mo baanu nso te.
Good stuff, just good!.	Nneɛma a ɛyɛ papa, ɛyɛ papa ara kwa!.
This has happened a few times.	Eyi asi mpɛn kakraa bi.
I wanted to know it all, understand it all	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu ne nyinaa, mete ne nyinaa ase
It is not dangerous.	Ɛnyɛ nea asiane wom.
That he took that opportunity to get here and.	Sɛ ɔde saa hokwan no dii dwuma de baa ha na.
I never should have asked you to date him	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo da sɛ wo ne no bɛbɔ
I will take you to him.	Mede wo bɛkɔ ne nkyɛn.
You, or the stakeholders.	Wo, anaasɛ wɔn a wɔde wɔn ho hyɛ mu no.
Most of it is head work.	Ne mu dodow no ara yɛ ti adwuma.
Not that he had anything better to do.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ na ɔwɔ biribi a eye sen saa a ɔbɛyɛ.
No one mentioned it.	Obiara anka ho asɛm.
I can’t imagine how you can help me	Mintumi nsusuw sɛnea wubetumi aboa me ho
Give him time.	Ma no bere.
I think he likes the idea	Misusuw sɛ n’ani gye adwene no ho
I must have forgotten here	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ me werɛ afi wɔ ha
I know he knows.	Minim sɛ onim.
What a mouthful.	Ano bɛn ara ni.
I think anything is possible	Misusuw sɛ biribiara betumi ayɛ yiye
I want to believe him	Mepɛ sɛ migye no di
They work in the same industry.	Wɔyɛ adwuma wɔ adwuma koro no ara mu.
Floor face, now.	Fam anim, mprempren.
We can’t use more.	Yɛrentumi mfa pii nni dwuma.
Maybe there is no dog.	Ebia ɔkraman biara nni hɔ.
Nothing but yourself and what you want to do.	Biribiara nni hɔ gye wo ho ne nea wopɛ sɛ woyɛ.
He knew his son well, and he knew his friends.	Ná onim ne ba no yiye, na na onim ne nnamfo nso.
I need to tell you something about myself	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka me ho asɛm bi kyerɛ wo
A cute boy who doesn’t have much time for her right now	Abarimaa a ne ho yɛ fɛ a onni bere pii mma no mprempren
Nor is it necessary.	Saa ara nso na ɛho nhia.
I really need to do some work	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma bi ankasa
Mom, you are always so hard on her.	Maame, woyɛ den saa bere nyinaa wɔ ne ho.
Get rid of it.	Yi no fi hɔ.
I shouldn't have brought this on you	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mede eyi ba wo so
In other words, assume the situation is real.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, fa no sɛ tebea no yɛ nokware.
I thought it was anyway	Misusuwii sɛ ɛte saa ɔkwan biara so
I like this one here though	M’ani gye eyi ho wɔ ha de, nanso
I have done him wrong.	Mayɛ no bɔne.
There are many popular brands	Nneɛma ahorow pii a agye din wɔ hɔ
He wanted to do this alone, anyway.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔno nkutoo yɛ eyi, sɛnea ɛte biara.
It was really like a backyard house project.	Ná ɛte sɛ ofie adwuma bi a ɛwɔ akyi ankasa.
I am free tomorrow morning.	Mede me ho ɔkyena anɔpa.
The problem was his.	Ná ɔhaw no yɛ ne de.
I hope you enjoy it	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho
I have plans for that boy	Mewɔ nhyehyɛe ahorow ama saa abarimaa no
People need to know.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo hu.
Maybe not two years ago.	Ebia ɛnyɛ mfe abien ni.
I am outside, not part of it anymore.	Mewɔ abɔnten, ɛnyɛ ne fã bio.
There was no problem.	Ná ɔhaw biara nni hɔ.
However, I doubt that was the case	Nanso, migye kyim sɛ na ɛte saa
They are opportunities at best.	Wɔyɛ hokwan ahorow wɔ nea eye sen biara mu.
I didn’t want to do it anymore	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ bio
He seemed to do whatever he wanted.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔno nso yɛɛ nea ɔpɛ biara.
That is a very important thing.	Ɛno yɛ ade a ɛho hia yiye.
I just wanted you to know that.	Ná mepɛ sɛ wuhu saa ara kɛkɛ.
I didn’t want this to end badly	Ná mempɛ sɛ eyi bɛba awiei bɔne
We are in it for it, believe me.	Yɛwɔ mu ma no, gye me di.
Where is that leading us anyway???.	Ɛhe na ɛno de yɛn rekɔ ɔkwan biara so???.
I take care of it in my house	Me na mehwɛ so wɔ me fie
A lot has been put on him.	Wɔde nneɛma pii ahyɛ ne so.
The paper looks good.	Krataa no hwɛ yiye.
I just don't do that.	Meyɛ sɛ menyɛ saa ara kwa.
I think he was always a bit of a problem	Misusuw sɛ na ɔyɛ ɔhaw kakra bere nyinaa
I was the only one there	Ɔno nkutoo na na mewɔ hɔ
Please take me with you.	Mesrɛ wo, fa me ka wo ho.
A hand lifted his head	Nsa bi maa ne ti so
The simplicity struck him.	Sɛnea ɛyɛ mmerɛw no bɔɔ no.
Nor do I wish them to do so in this case, as he was	Saa ara na me nso mempɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa wɔ asɛm yi ho, sɛnea na ɔte no
The first and only one.	Nea edi kan ne nea ɛwɔ hɔ nkutoo.
You’ve used it that way.	Wode adi dwuma saa.
To you, it doesn’t matter.	Wo fam no, ɛho nhia biara.
It was just too complicated.	Ná ɛyɛ nea ɛyɛ den dodo ara kwa.
I could still see the street through a window	Ná meda so ara tumi fa mfɛnsere bi mu hu abɔnten so
That time is not now.	Saa bere no nyɛ mprempren.
The school looked into this.	Sukuu no hwɛɛ eyi mu.
I am sorry to say they are true	Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ meka sɛ wɔyɛ nokware
Everything was going well.	Ná biribiara rekɔ yiye.
His father needs to talk to him.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ne papa ne no kasa.
I could spend a whole day here	Ná metumi adi da mũ nyinaa wɔ ha
I slipped out of my mind	Mede me ho fii m’adwene mu
But it’s not really that.	Nanso ɛnyɛ saa ankasa.
I know, you all can’t believe your eyes	Minim, mo nyinaa ntumi nnye mo ani nni
Such a day.	Da a ɛte saa.
Or that it should be.	Anaasɛ sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛte saa.
I have to keep it up	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ so di so
But no one seems to care.	Nanso ɛte sɛ nea obiara mfa ne ho.
Big mistake, all right.	Mfomso kɛse, yiye.
I totally disagree with the whole thing	Me ne asɛm no nyinaa nyɛ adwene koraa
I look at the whole situation	Mehwɛ tebea no nyinaa
I shot him with this gun	Mede saa tuo yi too no tuo
I loved everything about him	Ná m’ani gye ne ho biribiara ho
But it is very powerful.	Nanso tumi wom paa.
I almost didn’t want to deal with it let alone talk about it	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mempɛ sɛ me ne no bedi ho asɛm mpo aka ho asɛm
There is no other issue on the table.	Asɛm foforo biara nni pon no so.
However, I don’t know	Nanso, minnim
People tell me things.	Nkurɔfo ka nneɛma kyerɛ me.
I have to even it all out in a weird way	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ne nyinaa mpo wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so
Nothing seems to help.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara mmoa.
Now the street knows.	Mprempren abɔnten so nim.
Finally, I told him	Awiei koraa no, meka kyerɛɛ no
Or it’s really late.	Anaasɛ aka akyi ankasa.
I put it down.	Mede too hɔ.
I saw his eyes that night	Mihuu n’ani saa anadwo no
He knew what that meant.	Ná onim nea ɛno kyerɛ.
And we have our own.	Na yɛn nso yɛn de.
Problems are not as many as they appear.	Ɔhaw ahorow nyɛ pii sɛnea ɛda adi no.
He squinted at her.	Ɔde n’ani kyerɛɛ no.
I think time is like that	Misusuw sɛ bere te saa
This shouldn’t be too difficult.	Ɛnsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ den dodo.
I did it like him.	Meyɛɛ no ​​te sɛ ɔno.
I know too well how good you are.	Minim yiye dodo sɛnea woyɛ papa.
Get out of yourself, now.	Fi wo ho, mprempren.
I had one chance and one chance only	Na mewɔ hokwan biako ne hokwan biako pɛ
Maybe I should have expected it	Ebia anka ɛsɛ sɛ mehwɛ kwan
I hope you will join me there	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wobɛka me ho wɔ hɔ
They didn’t have to.	Ná enhia sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
Tell me what not to do.	Ka nea menyɛ kyerɛ me.
This was a really painful thing.	Na eyi yɛ ade a ɛyɛ yaw ankasa.
It was his idea.	Ná ɛyɛ n’adwene.
I told him that you knew him	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ wunim no
I see what it is.	Mihu nea ɛyɛ.
And it was a good one.	Na ɛyɛ papa.
I don’t know what happened there.	Minnim nea esii wɔ hɔ.
No doubt he hoped so.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɔwɔ anidaso sɛ ɛte saa.
He knew that.	Ná onim saa.
I didn’t want to know his opinion	Ná mempɛ sɛ mihu n’adwene
And surely that must mean something.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno kyerɛ biribi.
I could tell him anything	Ná metumi aka biribiara akyerɛ no
The street is empty.	Abɔnten so yɛ baabi a hwee nni hɔ.
And people understand that this is a system that works.	Na nkurɔfo te ase sɛ eyi yɛ nhyehyɛe a ɛyɛ adwuma.
I saw a few after that	Mihuu kakraa bi wɔ ɛno akyi
The game no longer mattered.	Ná agoru no ho nhia bio.
But it is, good.	Nanso ɛyɛ, eye.
There was no one on the street.	Ná obiara nni abɔnten so.
What it is is the cheapest option.	Nea ɛyɛ ne ɔkwan a ne bo yɛ mmerɛw.
It's both no two.	Na tu no tu.
You just tell it like it is.	Woka no sɛnea ɛte no ara pɛ.
Every single day is a good plan.	Da koro biara yɛ nhyehyɛe pa.
I immediately felt like my old self again.	Ntɛm ara na metee nka sɛ me dedaw no bio.
I had to do that for me	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ saa ma me
So they should be interested.	Enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔn ani gye ho.
You have to tell me what it is you want.	Ɛsɛ sɛ woka nea ɛyɛ a wopɛ kyerɛ me.
I got involved in it.	Mede me ho hyɛɛ mu.
I went there every day.	Ná mekɔ hɔ da biara da.
He was big and strong.	Ná ɔyɛ kɛse na na ne ho yɛ den.
If anything, they are even stronger today.	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, wɔn ho yɛ den sen saa mpo nnɛ.
If all is needed all must be given.	Sɛ ne nyinaa ho hia a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde ne nyinaa ma.
That was the first face my new eyes had seen.	Ɛno ne anim a edi kan a m’ani foforo no ahu.
I want to keep addressing that	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so di saa asɛm no ho dwuma
I don't like it.	M'ani nnye ho.
Maybe it was too soon.	Ebia na ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo.
My head film part was not working.	Ná me ti sini no fã no ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
I didn’t need to know that	Ná enhia sɛ mihu saa
Now they enjoy it.	Seesei wɔn ani gye ho.
You can see it on their faces.	Wubetumi ahu wɔ wɔn anim.
If it is in my power .	Sɛ ɛwɔ me tumi mu a .
That’s the big picture.	Ɛno ne mfonini kɛse no.
I just wanted to believe it.	Ná mepɛ sɛ migye di ara kwa.
I still think this is a very interesting project.	Meda so ara susuw sɛ eyi yɛ adwuma a ɛyɛ anigye yiye.
It was already night, and she was alone.	Ná anadwo adu dedaw, na na ɔno nkutoo na ɔwɔ hɔ.
I was a monitor.	Ná meyɛ obi a mehwɛ nneɛma so.
We can go or you can see him.	Yebetumi akɔ anaasɛ wubetumi ahu no.
I knew it was something	Ná minim sɛ ɛyɛ biribi
Say it now.	Ka no seesei.
They are both like that.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa te saa.
I had everything and nothing at the same time	Ná mewɔ biribiara na na minni hwee bere koro mu
It was a test.	Ná ɛyɛ sɔhwɛ.
I still want to make the book about you.	Meda so ara pɛ sɛ meyɛ nhoma no fa wo ho.
I can’t see this.	Mintumi nhu eyi.
He had his plan.	Ná ɔwɔ ne nhyehyɛe.
But it doesn’t have to work that way.	Nanso enhia sɛ ɛyɛ adwuma saa.
Nevertheless, they were similar in most respects	Ne nyinaa mu no, na ɛte sɛ wɔn wɔ nneɛma dodow no ara mu
So we have.	Enti yɛwɔ.
Most of it has power.	Ne mu dodow no ara wɔ tumi.
Those who do, get out of there.	Wɔn a wɔyɛ saa no, fi hɔ kɔ.
That makes me very happy.	Ɛno ma m’ani gye paa.
What else can we do.	Dɛn bio na yebetumi.
Your book will be a great help.	Wo nhoma no bɛyɛ mmoa kɛse.
So he does that.	Enti ɔyɛ saa.
I don’t really think much of it to be honest	Minsusuw ho pii ankasa sɛ mɛka nokware a
I couldn’t do anything about it anymore.	Na mintumi nyɛ ho hwee bio.
Another man comes out.	Ɔbarima foforo nso fi adi.
But you don’t like it.	Nanso w’ani nnye ho.
There are many of them.	Wɔn mu pii wɔ hɔ.
Every story still matters.	Asɛm biara da so ara ho hia.
I really need to take some time	Ɛsɛ sɛ migye bere kakra ankasa
I saw that face	Mihuu saa anim no
I can and will overcome this	Metumi na metumi adi eyi so nkonim
Someone who was quite powerful.	Obi a na ɔwɔ tumi koraa.
I told you to watch out for him	Meka kyerɛɛ wo sɛ hwɛ yiye wɔ ne ho
None of this is true.	Eyi mu biara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nokware.
I have to tell you now	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo mprempren
It’s been a while.	Ɛyɛ bere tiaa bi ni.
It was just too wet.	Ná ɛyɛ nsu dodo ara kwa.
Add one more to it.	Fa biako bio ka ho.
But, I think he was one of us	Nanso, misusuw sɛ na ɔyɛ yɛn mu biako
I look down into his eyes	Mehwɛ n’ani so wɔ fam
This is completely wrong.	Eyi yɛ mfomso koraa.
I forgot to mention it	Me werɛ fii sɛ mɛka ho asɛm
I knew where he would go	Ná minim baabi a ɔbɛkɔ
I think he knows what’s going on	Misusuw sɛ onim nea ɛrekɔ so
I already have to go	Ɛsɛ sɛ mekɔ dedaw
I didn't have much of a background	Ná minni akyi kɛse
Often, no one is interested in these matters.	Mpɛn pii no, obiara ani nnye saa nsɛm yi ho.
And only for money.	Na sika nkutoo nti.
That didn’t work either.	Ɛno nso anyɛ adwuma.
I have enough of it.	Mewɔ nea ɛdɔɔso.
Still got the same error.	Da so ara nyaa mfomso koro no ara.
And it was cold.	Na awɔw wom.
He is working today.	Ɔreyɛ adwuma nnɛ.
I was his and his alone for the night	Ná meyɛ ne de na na meyɛ ne nkutoo anadwo no
I am glad you are here with me	Ɛyɛ me anigye sɛ wo ne me wɔ ha
I am still working on it.	Meda so ara reyɛ ho adwuma.
I’m glad you’re here	M’ani agye sɛ wowɔ ha
I was almost in time.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mewɔ bere mu.
I want to believe it.	Mepɛ sɛ migye di.
Close your windows.	To wo mfɛnsere mu.
I would really appreciate it if you would give me this book.	Sɛ wode nhoma yi bɛma me a, m’ani begye ho ankasa.
I can’t tell you this.	Mintumi nkyerɛ eyi.
At least that’s what it seems like.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na ɛte sɛ nea ɛte.
I know what you just said	Minim nea wokae seesei ara
I was very impressed with him.	M’ani gyee ne ho kɛse.
I want more than this	Mepɛ pii sen eyi
But only half of it.	Nanso fã pɛ.
Or anyone else for that matter.	Anaasɛ obi foforo biara ma saa asɛm no.
There was hope in the room.	Ná anidaso wɔ dan no mu.
I didn’t know at the time that we were going to do that	Saa bere no na minnim sɛ yɛbɛyɛ saa
But he knew the people too well.	Nanso na onim nkurɔfo no yiye dodo.
I believe that everything will be fine	Migye di sɛ biribiara bɛyɛ yiye
She looked so good in it and she knew it.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye wɔ mu na na onim.
He came home with two of them.	Ɔne wɔn mu baanu baa fie.
We don’t like the food.	Yɛn ani nnye aduan no ho.
This didn’t mean it wasn’t necessary.	Eyi ankyerɛ sɛ ɛho nhia.
He works for someone else.	Ɔyɛ adwuma ma obi foforo.
Go back to bed.	San kɔ mpa so.
He knows what the mind has to say	Onim nea ɛsɛ sɛ adwene no ka
It’s been a long day.	Ɛyɛ da tenten bi.
I want to look this guy in the eye	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ saa ɔbarima yi ani so
I am very much looking forward to it	Mehwɛ kwan paa
Her hair was longer.	Ná ne ti nhwi yɛ tenten sen saa.
I always thought that was weird	Bere nyinaa na misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa
He wanted to use me any way he thought he could.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ ɔde me di dwuma ɔkwan biara a osusuw sɛ obetumi.
But he did it anyway.	Nanso ɔyɛɛ saa ɔkwan biara so.
In any case.	Wɔ tebea biara mu.
We had lunch.	Ná yɛwɔ awia aduan.
This is, in my opinion, kind of bad.	Eyi yɛ, wɔ m’adwene mu no, bɔne bi.
I had to give him something	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mede biribi ma no
I could no longer handle the situation	Ná mintumi nni tebea a na ɛwɔ hɔ no ho dwuma bio
One is just a hand pat on clothes.	Biako ne nsa a wɔde bɔ ntade so kɛkɛ.
I still couldn’t see it clearly	Ná meda so ara ntumi nhu no yiye
It doesn’t work.	Ɛnyɛ adwuma.
No one ever knows what he is doing.	Obiara nnim nea ɔreyɛ da.
At some point in time.	Wɔ bere bi mu.
I keep giving them	Mekɔ so de wɔn ma
And certainly, that was the case for me.	Na akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ, na ɛte saa wɔ me fam.
It hurts, but you’re not him.	Ɛyɛ yaw, nanso wonyɛ ɔno.
And that hurt me.	Na ɛno yɛɛ me yaw.
If so, I would be surprised	Sɛ ɛte saa a, anka ɛbɛyɛ me nwonwa
The man was completely relieved	Ɔbarima no ho tɔɔ no koraa
But there has to be a reason.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a enti ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I was late for work that day	Ná meka akyi wɔ adwuma mu saa da no
It has them all in some form.	Ɛwɔ wɔn nyinaa wɔ tebea bi mu.
I still wanted too much	Ná meda so ara pɛ nneɛma pii dodo
I understand.	Mete ase.
I believe that is what we all need to do	Migye di sɛ ɛno ne nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa yɛ
I never knew why.	Minnim nea enti a ɛte saa da.
Believe me, he did.	Gye me di, ɔyɛɛ saa.
Can you solve that for me ?.	So wubetumi adi saa asɛm no ho dwuma ama me ?.
I had already forgotten you	Ná me werɛ afi wo dedaw
This is for you personally, not for me.	Eyi yɛ wo ankasa de, ɛnyɛ me de.
I would be someone else for him.	Anka mɛyɛ obi foforo ama no.
You gave that to us.	Wo na wode saa maa yɛn.
It was very good.	Ná eye paa.
I can’t figure out what’s going wrong.	Me ntumi nhu nea ɛrekɔ so bɔne.
I wish you the best	Mepɛ sɛ eye ma wo
I really understand.	Mete ase ampa.
I have a variety of resources	Mewɔ nneɛma ahorow a mede bedi dwuma
I am stronger now, and so are you.	Me ho yɛ den seesei, na wo nso wo ho yɛ den.
I wanted to talk to him	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne no kasa
Her headaches were terrible.	Ná ne ti a ɛyɛ no yaw no yɛ hu.
I guess he doesn’t really like me as a person	Misusuw sɛ n’ani nnye me ho ankasa sɛ onipa
I like what you said	M’ani gye nea wokae no ho
People love pictures.	Nkurɔfo ani gye mfonini ahorow ho.
I see your clothes and friends	Mihu wo ntade ne wo nnamfo
I have no idea.	Minni adwene biara.
That’s not a given.	Ɛno nyɛ ade a wɔde ama.
It’s easy and really really important to me.	Ɛnyɛ den na ɛho hia me ankasa ankasa.
It works well.	Ɛyɛ adwuma yiye.
What he has done.	Nea wayɛ.
I think something is going on behind the scenes	Misusuw sɛ biribi rekɔ so wɔ akyi
I know we can be best friends	Minim sɛ yebetumi ayɛ nnamfo paa
Sounds easy enough to do.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ.
Something he had	Ade bi a na ɔwɔ
So inexpensive, simple, and a great addition to any meal.	Enti ne bo nyɛ den, ɛnyɛ den, na ɛyɛ ade kɛse a wɔde ka aduan biara ho.
It’s not even the last word.	Ɛnyɛ asɛm a etwa to mpo.
I want nothing but the best	Mempɛ hwee sɛ nea eye sen biara
This is no longer a new idea.	Eyi nyɛ adwene foforo bio.
There are so many things that people just don’t know.	Nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a nkurɔfo nnim ara kwa.
Hours and hours every night.	Nnɔnhwerew ne nnɔnhwerew anadwo biara.
I loved how realistic, simple, and wonderful this book is	M’ani gyee sɛnea nhoma yi yɛ ankasa, ɛnyɛ den, na ɛyɛ nwonwa no ho
I could have done more for you	Anka metumi ayɛ pii ama wo
His attention to me.	N’adwene a ɔde sii me so.
But this is just wrong.	Nanso eyi yɛ mfomso ara kwa.
I have to say she looks great	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka sɛ ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye
You know that’s not the truth.	Wunim sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno ne nokware no.
I definitely want your help buying a new car	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ mepɛ wo mmoa a wode bɛtɔ kar foforo
He was alone for a while.	Ná ɔno nkutoo wɔ hɔ kakra.
Please take her home.	Mesrɛ wo, wode no bɛkɔ fie.
I slept all day, every day	Na meda da mũ nyinaa, da biara
I finally felt it.	Awiei koraa no, metee nka.
He’s just like that.	Ɔte saa ara kɛkɛ.
I can do that later.	Metumi ayɛ saa akyiri yi.
We’ll be relieved.	Yɛn ho bɛtɔ yɛn.
I got very, very, very, very good	Me nyaa papa paa, paa paa, paa paa, paa
He knew what he was doing that night.	Ná onim nea ɔreyɛ saa anadwo no.
He can make it look like something else.	Obetumi ama ayɛ sɛ biribi foforo.
If anything, things could go the other way.	Sɛ biribi wɔ hɔ a, na nneɛma betumi akɔ ɔkwan foforo so.
It was the hand towards the end	Ná ɛyɛ nsa a ɛrekɔ awiei no
Someone has to do that at all or else	Ɛsɛ sɛ obi yɛ saa koraa anaasɛ ɛnte saa
The figure shows one experiment.	Mfonini no kyerɛ sɛnea wɔyɛ sɔhwɛ biako.
I had no money to work with	Ná minni sika a mede bɛyɛ adwuma
Something big, and surprisingly beautiful.	Biribi kɛse, na ɛyɛ nwonwa a ɛyɛ fɛ.
Don’t take it literally.	Mfa no sɛ ɛyɛ nokware ankasa.
I'll take a car.	Mede kar bɛkɔ.
I know that’s not the gun	Minim sɛ ɛnyɛ ɛno ne tuo no
But he loved the game.	Nanso na n’ani gye agoru no ho.
But how often is that likely to happen anyway.	Nanso mpɛn ahe na ɛda adi sɛ ɛno bɛba ɔkwan biara so.
Her hair was anyway.	Ná ne ti nhwi yɛ ɔkwan biara so.
The first is the overall size.	Nea edi kan ne ne kɛse nyinaa.
I certainly used to	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ kan no na meyɛ saa
I didn’t know you liked work.	Ná minnim sɛ w’ani gye adwuma ho.
I'll go with him	Me ne no bɛkɔ
Look, it’s so simple.	Hwɛ, ɛyɛ mmerɛw yiye.
At any given time.	Wɔ bere biara mu.
I still can’t figure out what it was	Meda so ara ntumi nhu nea na ɛyɛ
Somehow he knew.	Ɔkwan bi so no na onim.
I don’t even know what it is.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ mpo.
I hadn’t thought about it either	Ná me nso minsusuw ho
I talk to them now more than ever	Me ne wɔn kasa mprempren sen bere biara
I was shocked too, to be honest with you	Me nso me ho dwiriw me, sɛ mɛka nokware akyerɛ wo a
New people every night, every week, it goes on.	Nnipa foforo anadwo biara, dapɛn biara, kɔ so.
But that was not his nature.	Nanso na ɛnyɛ ne su ne saa.
It wasn’t real.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea ɛwɔ hɔ ankasa.
You can add several types.	Wubetumi de ahorow pii aka ho.
Success is the ability to solve problems.	Odi yiye ne tumi a obi betumi adi ɔhaw ahorow ho dwuma.
You want people to think you know what you’re doing.	Wopɛ sɛ nkurɔfo susuw sɛ wunim nea woreyɛ.
Everyone liked him.	Ná obiara ani gye ne ho.
The music is great.	Nnwom no yɛ kɛse.
I was a different person.	Ná meyɛ onipa foforo.
It matters little, too.	Ɛho nhia kakraa bi, nso.
I was sitting on the bed	Ná mete mpa no so
I think you could have done something	Misusuw sɛ anka wubetumi ayɛ biribi
I really like your comments.	M’ani gye wo nsɛm no ho ankasa.
I am sorry he is gone.	Ɛyɛ me yaw sɛ onni hɔ bio.
I hope you are doing well.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ woreyɛ yiye.
What a terrible day.	Da a ɛyɛ hu bɛn ara ni.
If he does, only the person himself knows.	Sɛ ɔyɛ saa no, onipa no ankasa nkutoo na onim.
Or you can do both.	Anaasɛ wubetumi ayɛ abien no nyinaa.
They all start out.	Wɔn nyinaa fi ase.
In the room.	Wɔ dan no mu.
Your hair	Wo ti nhwi .
It’s good that it’s in the paper.	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ ɛwɔ krataa no mu.
No one ever even gave me a first impression.	Obiara amma me adwene a edi kan mpo da.
I have no problem with it	Minni ɔhaw biara wɔ ho
I want to get to know him better.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu no yiye.
I just think about all that all the time	Misusuw saa nneɛma no nyinaa ho ara kwa bere nyinaa
I had to admit it was a good day	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ migye tom sɛ na ɛyɛ da pa
I have a lot of things to do for that	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ma ɛno
I would like to know how to do this.	Mepɛ sɛ mihu sɛnea mɛyɛ eyi.
Not much at all.	Ɛnyɛ pii koraa.
I didn’t think it would	Na minsusuw sɛ ɛbɛyɛ saa
we are very interested in it.	yɛn ani gye ho paa.
He was always bright.	Ná ne ho yɛ hyew bere nyinaa.
I know you want someone to make it all better	Minim sɛ wopɛ sɛ obi ma ne nyinaa yɛ yiye
Let us be strong.	Ma yɛn ho nyɛ den.
You are very good.	Woyɛ papa paa.
I am thankful to be alive	Meda ase sɛ mewɔ nkwa mu
For a game.	Wɔ agoru bi ho.
None of us said anything.	Yɛn mu biara anka hwee.
That was a great thing.	Ɛno yɛɛ ade kɛse.
I want to see the ending	Mepɛ sɛ mihu awiei no
We brought him home.	Yɛde no baa fie.
I like to use my imagination and imagination	M’ani gye ho sɛ mede m’adwene ne m’adwene bedi dwuma
They will usually appreciate the good information you give them.	Mpɛn pii no, wɔn ani begye nsɛm pa a wode ma wɔn no ho.
I certainly wasn’t one of them	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na menyɛ wɔn mu biako
But no one came.	Nanso obiara amma.
There are problems with this approach.	Ɔhaw ahorow wɔ saa kwan yi ho.
He didn’t want you to know you could do this.	Na ɔmpɛ sɛ wuhu sɛ wubetumi ayɛ eyi.
I always liked his name	Ná m’ani gye ne din ho bere nyinaa
Maybe you should do that.	Ebia ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ saa.
Throughout those years.	Wɔ saa mfe no nyinaa mu.
Not everyone is in it.	Ɛnyɛ obiara na ɔwɔ mu.
I know you probably know this	Minim sɛ ebia wunim eyi
I really like what you put on us.	M’ani gye nea wode hyɛ yɛn ho no ho ankasa.
It is both the product itself and the quality of the product.	Ɛyɛ ade no ankasa ne ade no su nyinaa.
He knows everyone in industry, even by name.	Onim obiara a ɔwɔ nnwuma mu, ne din mpo.
I give you everything	Mede biribiara ma wo
However, she had done all she could to help him.	Nanso, na wayɛ nea obetumi biara de aboa no.
We can’t let the police get him.	Yɛrentumi mma polisifo nnya no.
I can prove my innocence later	Metumi akyerɛ sɛ me ho nni asɛm akyiri yi
She was wonderful, beautiful.	Ná ɔyɛ nwonwa, ne ho yɛ fɛ.
Some other information.	Nsɛm foforo bi.
I can’t find anything to work with	Mintumi nnya biribiara mfa nyɛ adwuma
I know he would love to help us	Minim sɛ n’ani begye ho sɛ ɔbɛboa yɛn
One could get used to almost anything.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na obi betumi ayɛ biribiara ho su.
I want the boy to come with me	Mepɛ sɛ abarimaa no ne me ba
Every day had to be their day.	Na ɛsɛ sɛ da biara yɛ wɔn da.
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ ɔkyena
I feel very strongly	Mete nka denneennen paa
It doesn’t happen anymore.	Ɛnyɛ bio.
It’s the truth.	Ɛyɛ nokware no.
Maybe he wants us all to go.	Ebia ɔpɛ sɛ yɛn nyinaa kɔ.
I even use my real name.	Mede me din ankasa mpo di dwuma.
That has to be there.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɛno ba hɔ.
I didn’t want to do that	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa
He told her that he had no one to take an interest in.	Ɔka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ onni obiara a n’ani begye ho.
I knew he always wanted the best for me	Ná minim sɛ na ɔpɛ nea eye sen biara ma me bere nyinaa
I was in this city all this time	Na mewɔ kurow yi mu saa bere yi nyinaa
We are out there.	Yɛwɔ abɔnten hɔ.
This is a timeline.	Eyi yɛ bere a wɔde yɛ nneɛma.
Our words fed him.	Yɛn nsɛm no maa no aduan.
I have no intention of going	Minni adwene biara sɛ mɛkɔ
This is what we have.	Eyi ne nea yɛwɔ.
I have a strong opinion on that	Mewɔ adwene a ɛyɛ den wɔ saa asɛm no ho
It was in his bedroom, you know.	Na ɛwɔ ne mpa mu, wunim.
I feel bad about dating any girl	Mete nka bɔne wɔ abeawa biara a ɔne no bɛbɔ no ho
People need to be able to recognize you.	Ɛsɛ sɛ nkurɔfo tumi hu wo.
My window is close.	Me mfɛnsere no bɛn.
If you don’t care about them, that’s fine.	Sɛ wɔn ho nhia wo a, ɛyɛ papa.
This book shows you how.	Nhoma yi kyerɛ wo sɛnea.
All right, no big deal.	Ɛyɛ papa, ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse biara.
But your mother	Nanso wo maame .
This is a real job.	Eyi yɛ adwuma ankasa.
That money was nothing.	Ná saa sika no nyɛ hwee.
I was just as bad as the rest of them	Ná meyɛ bɔne te sɛ wɔn a aka no ara pɛ
However, that is not the issue here.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ ɛno ne asɛm no wɔ ha.
A little late isn't it	Ka akyi kakra so ɛnte saa
I still don't say anything	Meda so ara nka hwee
I want to see you both as soon as possible	Mepɛ sɛ mihu mo baanu ntɛm ara sɛnea metumi biara
I know what it’s like	Minim sɛnea ɛte
But one more is .	Nanso biako bio ne .
I had to say something.	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meka biribi.
I feel so alive and full	Mete nka sɛ mete ase na meyɛ ma kɛse
She did not want this man with her.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ ɔbarima yi bɛka ne ho.
I wanted to know.	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu.
They both have that same problem.	Wɔn baanu nyinaa wɔ saa ɔhaw koro no ara.
Or on a dog.	Anaasɛ ɔkraman bi so.
I want to remain a man	Mepɛ sɛ mekɔ so yɛ ɔbarima
I always looked up to you, you know	Bere nyinaa na mehwɛ wo so, wunim
Most of them are.	Wɔn mu dodow no ara.
You know what a good price is.	Wunim nea bo pa yɛ.
Everyone wants to be the best.	Obiara pɛ sɛ ɔyɛ nea eye sen biara.
It was just too soon	Ná ɛyɛ ntɛm dodo ara kwa
In the car.	Wɔ kar no mu.
I look forward to it every night	Mehwɛ kwan anadwo biara
He could have had good qualities.	Anka obetumi anya su pa ahorow.
And so it should be.	Na saa ara na ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ saa.
They were very beautiful.	Ná wɔn ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
This day his hands were full.	Ɛda yi na ne nsa ayɛ ma.
I didn't really mean it.	Ná ɛnyɛ nea mepɛ sɛ meka ankasa.
But even so, they are his.	Nanso saa mpo no, wɔyɛ ne de.
I thought he could play	Misusuwii sɛ obetumi adi agoru
He doesn’t know anyone is there, except himself.	Onnim sɛ obiara wɔ hɔ, gye sɛ ɔno ankasa.
At least that’s how it feels.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, saa na ɛte nka.
I want.	Mepɛ.
I owe him my life after that	Mede me nkwa ka no wɔ ɛno akyi
You are so beautiful.	Wo ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
This is important to them.	Eyi ho hia wɔn.
If you do, know this.	Sɛ woyɛ saa a, hu eyi.
So here is my plan for this year.	Enti me nhyehyɛe ma afe yi ni.
He has done this before, for food.	Wayɛ eyi pɛn, ama aduan.
I see that all the time	Mihu saa asɛm no bere nyinaa
But this article is none of those things.	Nanso saa asɛm yi nyɛ saa nneɛma no mu biara.
And that means .	Na ɛno kyerɛ sɛ .
You just have hope.	Wowɔ anidaso ara kwa.
We hope you enjoy it.	Yɛwɔ anidaso sɛ w’ani begye ho.
I can’t even see how you look.	Mintumi nhu sɛnea wo ho te mpo.
I didn’t want to watch	Ná mempɛ sɛ mehwɛ
He was in the movie.	Na ɔwɔ sini no mu.
It doesn’t matter at all, really.	Ɛnyɛ hwee koraa, ampa.
Nothing ever quite seems to work as it should.	Ɛte sɛ nea biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ adwuma sɛnea ɛsɛ sɛ ɛyɛ no koraa da.
A beautiful thing.	Ade a ɛyɛ fɛ.
I wanted to know more	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu pii sen saa
I think they are both gone.	Misusuw sɛ wɔn baanu nyinaa nni hɔ bio.
I was really sensitive.	Ná meyɛ obi a ɔte nka ankasa.
I really like the idea behind what you have here	M’ani gye adwene a ɛwɔ nea wowɔ wɔ ha no akyi no ho ankasa
Something similar is happening here.	Biribi a ɛte saa ara rekɔ so wɔ ha.
I want to sleep with him every night	Mepɛ sɛ me ne no da anadwo biara
I think this should be fine.	Misusuw sɛ ɛsɛ sɛ eyi yɛ yiye.
A time in the past.	Bere bi a atwam.
He’s a good guy.	Ɔyɛ nnipa pa.
Alternatively, you can get there by bike.	Sɛnea ɛbɛyɛ a wubetumi ayɛ saa no, wubetumi de sakre akɔ hɔ.
Something important happened here.	Biribi a ɛho hia sii wɔ ha.
He shouldn’t have said anything.	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ ɔka hwee.
And that’s what he wanted to do.	Na ɛno ne nea na ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ.
There are at least two reasons for this.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, nneɛma abien nti na ɛte saa.
I was always home alone	Ná me nkutoo na mewɔ fie bere nyinaa
I want to see them again	Mepɛ sɛ mihu wɔn bio
All starters except one.	Nneɛma a wɔde fi ase nyinaa gye biako.
I found something you might like	Mihuu biribi a ebia w’ani begye ho
I think the people can make up their own minds about what happened.	Misusuw sɛ nkurɔfo no betumi asi wɔn ankasa gyinae wɔ nea esii no ho.
You can see just as much.	Wubetumi ahu pii saa ara.
I needed to know what was going on inside	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so wɔ mu
So you know.	So wunim.
I glance at each of them	Mede m’ani hwɛ wɔn mu biara
So, get rid of them.	Enti, yi wɔn fi hɔ.
He didn't know how he felt.	Ná onnim sɛnea ɔte nka.
Not good, just you having that.	Ɛnyɛ papa, wo nkutoo a wowɔ saa.
But not so much.	Nanso ɛnyɛ pii saa.
That was part of the plan	Ná ɛno yɛ nhyehyɛe no fã
But not much.	Nanso ɛnyɛ pii.
I think you know what he looks like	Misusuw sɛ wunim sɛnea ɔte
A bad day was anything else	Ná da bɔne yɛ biribi foforo biara
This happened a lot in those early days.	Eyi sii pii wɔ saa nna a edi kan no mu.
I knew he was worried about his mother.	Ná minim sɛ ne maame ho asɛm haw no.
I know what he would say.	Minim nea anka ɔbɛka.
I know it is too late now.	Minim sɛ aka akyi dodo mprempren.
I can run faster than you	Metumi tu mmirika ntɛmntɛm sen wo
Like a lot of it.	Te sɛ pii.
I like to do things the right way	M’ani gye ho sɛ mɛyɛ nneɛma ɔkwan pa so
That’s really awesome.	Ɛno yɛ hu ankasa.
And the other thing.	Na ade foforo no nso.
And everything is the same.	Na biribiara yɛ saa ara.
He knew everything well.	Ná onim biribiara yiye.
And this isn’t the first time.	Na eyi nso nyɛ nea edi kan.
Seems like a great guy with a great mind.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔbarima kɛse bi a ɔwɔ adwene kɛse.
I think not really	Misusuw sɛ ɛnyɛ saa ankasa
For many reasons, that’s just a bad idea.	Nneɛma pii nti, ɛno yɛ adwene bɔne ara kwa.
Everyone turns to look at him.	Obiara dan ne ho hwɛ no.
I was willing to do it	Ná mewɔ ɔpɛ sɛ mɛyɛ
I didn’t even like it	Ná m’ani nnye ho mpo
And there will be another time.	Na bere foforo nso bɛba.
In the latter case.	Wɔ nea etwa to no mu.
Without a doubt, it was.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ na ɛte saa.
I can't.	Metumi.
I thought he would be gone for a year or so.	Misusuwii sɛ ɔbɛkɔ afe biako anaa nea ɛte saa.
I could never get out of this	Na mintumi mfi eyi mu da
Out here, names were irrelevant.	Wɔ ha akyi no, na din ahorow ho nhia.
Which is nothing new.	Nea ɛnyɛ ade foforo.
No one even knows where he is.	Obiara nnim baabi a ɔwɔ mpo.
A whole new movie	Sini foforo koraa
None of them had anything.	Ná wɔn mu biara nni hwee.
He does, like.	Ɔyɛ, te sɛ.
I know how bad you want this	Minim sɛnea wopɛ eyi bɔne fa
Look at this you see this right here.	Hwɛ eyi wo hu eyi wɔ ha yi ara.
It all works fine.	Ne nyinaa yɛ adwuma yiye.
In a weird way, it looked like me.	Wɔ ɔkwan a ɛyɛ nwonwa so no, na ɛte sɛ me.
I don’t know where it is	Minnim baabi a ɛwɔ
I want to hear all about you	Mepɛ sɛ mete wo ho nsɛm nyinaa
I have so much to tell you	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ meka kyerɛ wo
He is not a real person.	Ɔnyɛ obi ankasa.
If you have water problems, we can help.	Sɛ wowɔ nsu ho haw a, yebetumi aboa.
House looks at home.	Ofie hwɛ ofie.
In the night.	Anadwo mu.
I always knew this day would come	Ná minim bere nyinaa sɛ saa da yi bɛba
I always wanted to be first	Ná mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nea odi kan bere nyinaa
I love it if he does	M’ani gye ho sɛ ɔyɛ saa a
A monster is a monster, after all	Aboa kɛse yɛ aboa kɛse, ne nyinaa akyi no
In one blistering moment, it's over.	Wɔ bere biako a ɛyɛ hyew mu no, aba awiei.
Everyone has their own abilities and desires.	Obiara wɔ ne tumi ne nea ɔpɛ.
I can’t get used to anyone else.	Mintumi nyɛ obi foforo biara ho su.
It will be interesting enough.	Ɛbɛyɛ anigye sɛnea ɛsɛ.
If it is not long.	Sɛ ɛnyɛ tenten a.
Cold but lots of fun.	Awɔw nanso ɛyɛ anigye pii.
I wanted it so much right now	Ná mepɛ no yiye mprempren ara
I'm on one right now.	Mewɔ biako so mprempren ara.
Our plan is there.	Yɛn nhyehyɛe no wɔ hɔ.
I have a lot to say about that book	Mewɔ nsɛm pii ka fa saa nhoma no ho
Probably all of those things.	Ebia saa nneɛma no nyinaa.
Again, no big deal.	Bio nso, ɛnyɛ asɛm kɛse biara.
I know exactly why	Minim nea enti a ɛte saa ankasa
I hope he does that.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɔbɛyɛ saa.
I love the way they do it.	M’ani gye sɛnea wɔyɛ no ho.
This could happen again.	Eyi betumi aba bio.
He doesn’t do anything to show it.	Ɔnyɛ biribiara mfa nkyerɛ.
At least not yet.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛnyɛ mprempren de besi nnɛ.
She has brought such joy to this house.	Ɔde anigye a ɛte saa aba ofie yi mu.
But one day it was mine	Nanso da koro bi na ɛyɛ me de
I'd better go to work.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ mekɔ adwuma.
He wanted to solve every problem.	Ná ɔpɛ sɛ odi ɔhaw biara ho dwuma.
You can collect your money later.	Wubetumi agye wo sika no akyiri yi.
A city is like a person in this way	Kurow bi te sɛ onipa wɔ saa kwan yi so
The mind alone does not have such power.	Adwene kɛkɛ nni tumi a ɛte saa.
This is his first season.	Eyi ne ne bere a edi kan.
I want to see my mom and dad	Mepɛ sɛ mihu me maame ne me papa
Feel what the team wants.	Te nea kuw no pɛ nka.
I had to be a part of this team	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ kuw yi fã
He is a handsome man.	Ɔyɛ ɔbarima a ne ho yɛ fɛ.
I couldn’t imagine it.	Ná mintumi nsusuw ho.
This only gives your power.	Eyi ma wo tumi no nkutoo ma.
I still think there is a greater evil at work here	Meda so ara susuw sɛ bɔne kɛse bi reyɛ adwuma wɔ ha
But it wasn’t.	Nanso na ɛte saa.
I really like this one .	M’ani gye eyi ho ankasa .
He showed it to his father.	Ɔde kyerɛɛ ne papa.
I'm afraid to do it.	Me suro sɛ mɛyɛ.
That must have been the case.	Ɛbɛyɛ sɛ na ɛte saa.
I know them, all right	Minim wɔn, ɛyɛ yiye
A wonderful child.	Abofra bi a ɔyɛ nwonwa.
I think you may have just surprised him	Misusuw sɛ ebia woayɛ no nwonwa ara kwa
I don’t want to go without you.	Mempɛ sɛ mekɔ a wo nka ho.
It’s like a game.	Ɛte sɛ agoru bi.
In this case, however, there was another reason.	Nanso, wɔ eyi mu no, na biribi foforo a enti a ɛte saa wɔ hɔ.
It just seems absolutely fantastic.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ nwonwa koraa ara kwa.
It seems very strong.	Ɛte sɛ nea ano yɛ den yiye.
It seemed easy.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea ɛnyɛ den.
It’s not much about anything.	Ɛnyɛ biribiara ho asɛm pii.
That’s not the problem.	Ɛnyɛ ɛno ne ɔhaw no.
That’s totally fine though.	Ɛno yɛ papa koraa de, nanso.
In other words, don’t.	Ɔkwan foforo so no, nyɛ saa.
Add your name to it.	Fa wo din ka ho.
I enjoyed my time here	M’ani gyee bere a na mewɔ ha no ho
This can be sex, but it doesn’t have to be.	Eyi betumi ayɛ nna, nanso enhia sɛ ɛte saa.
I know he has done that.	Minim sɛ wayɛ saa.
It’s good to say that again	Ɛyɛ papa sɛ meka saa bio
I didn't know what to make of tonight	Ná minnim nea mɛyɛ wɔ anadwo yi ho
I know where he lives	Minim baabi a ɔte
I always wondered why he did it	Bere nyinaa na misusuw nea enti a ɔyɛɛ saa no ho
You'd better take me with you.	Ɛbɛyɛ papa sɛ wode me bɛka wo ho.
I was hoping you would say that	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ wobɛka saa
There was nothing like that.	Na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
You’ll be fine.	Wobɛyɛ yiye.
Everything that happened at the end is on me	Biribiara a esii wɔ awiei no da me so
It wasn’t a human being.	Ná ɛnyɛ onipa.
I can put in a good story for you	Metumi de asɛm pa bi ahyɛ mu ama wo
I don’t want to be hard on you	Mempɛ sɛ meyɛ den ma wo
Do a thought experiment.      	Yɛ adwene ho sɔhwɛ.      
But there was nothing for him.	Nanso na biribiara nni hɔ mma no.
. . . .	.
It’s a thrill.	Ɛyɛ anigye.
I’m absolutely thrilled.	M’ani agye koraa.
It was a very bad thing.	Ná ɛyɛ ade bɔne paa.
The two were good friends.	Ná wɔn baanu no yɛ nnamfo pa.
That’s what risk is.	Ɛno ne nea asiane yɛ.
I thought about it quickly.	Misusuw ho ntɛmntɛm.
I know my dog ​​does.	Minim sɛ me kraman yɛ saa.
I forgot all about it	Me werɛ fii ne nyinaa
He can just have fun.	Obetumi agye n’ani ara kwa.
I know the pros and cons	Minim papa ne bɔne a ɛwɔ mu
I don’t even know what it is.	Minnim nea ɛyɛ mpo.
That is the issue now.	Ɛno ne asɛm no mprempren.
I glanced at him, too	Me nso mede m’ani kyerɛɛ no
Things would be better then.	Anka nneɛma bɛyɛ papa saa bere no.
I want the best for you	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ nea eye sen biara ma wo
We do have some new information.	Yɛwɔ nsɛm foforo bi ampa.
I was never supposed to know	Ná ɛnsɛ sɛ mihu da
It certainly seems that way.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛte sɛ nea ɛte saa.
I really lived it.	Mede traa ase ankasa.
He's so great in that movie.	Ɔyɛ kɛse paa wɔ saa sini no mu.
I told him not to be strong	Meka kyerɛɛ no ​​sɛ ɔnyɛ den
This was a good test.	Ná eyi yɛ sɔhwɛ pa.
I can be so strong	Metumi ayɛ den saa
There was no one on the bed.	Ná obiara nni mpa no so.
I thought about what to say	Misusuw nea mɛka ho
He is in those years.	Ɔwɔ saa mfe no mu.
You, or someone you know, can join them.	Wo, anaa obi a wunim no betumi aka wɔn ho.
That’s the problem, you see.	Ɛno ne ɔhaw no, wuhu.
They were doing that.	Ná wɔyɛ saa.
I need to know immediately.	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu ntɛm ara.
I want to do it as well as you do	Mepɛ sɛ meyɛ no yiye te sɛ wo
I didn’t think this was possible for you.	Ná minsusuw sɛ eyi betumi ayɛ yiye ama wo.
It’s definitely one of the best things about that movie.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ ɛyɛ nneɛma a eye sen biara wɔ saa sini no mu no mu biako.
It seemed a little too good to be true.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eye dodo kakra sɛ ɛbɛyɛ nokware.
I have a lot of time	Mewɔ bere pii
This was not good enough.	Ná eyi nyɛ papa sɛnea ɛsɛ.
This is evident in everyday speech.	Eyi da adi wɔ kasa a wɔka no da biara da mu.
They were the only friends he had.	Wɔn nkutoo ne nnamfo a na ɔwɔ.
I know enough stories to tell	Minim nsɛm a ɛdɔɔso a mɛka
There was a story for them.	Na asɛm bi wɔ hɔ ma wɔn.
Great help for you in town	Mmoa kɛse ma wo wɔ kurow no mu
The wet clothes.	Ntade a ɛyɛ nsu no.
We were in it.	Ná yɛwɔ mu.
Not too much of it.	Ɛnyɛ pii dodo.
I still watch it every month	Meda so ara hwɛ no ɔsram biara
I couldn’t believe he was really gone	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛ na onni hɔ bio ankasa
It’s very beautiful.	Ɛyɛ fɛ yiye.
That all came to an end.	Ɛno nyinaa baa awiei.
The problem comes when there are three.	Ɔhaw no ba bere a wɔyɛ abiɛsa no.
I'm onto something I don't really know what it is.	Mewɔ biribi so a minnim nea ɛyɛ ankasa.
I can’t believe how young she is, how beautiful she is	Mintumi nnye nni sɛnea ɔyɛ abofra, sɛnea ne ho yɛ fɛ
This was nothing new for most of them.	Ná eyi nyɛ ade foforo mma wɔn mu dodow no ara.
This is what happened here.	Eyi ne nea esii wɔ ha.
So it’s also true.	Enti ɛyɛ nokware nso.
But it’s hard for us.	Nanso ɛyɛ den ma yɛn.
I couldn’t really express how I felt	Na mintumi nkyerɛ sɛnea mete nka ankasa
If not, next time.	Sɛ ɛnte saa a, bere foforo.
I'm on the ground.	Mewɔ fam.
All of these opportunities are brand new to you.	Saa hokwan yi nyinaa yɛ foforo koraa ma wo.
However, there is room for improvement.	Nanso, kwan wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ no yiye.
I have made mistakes, but I don’t know why.	Mayɛ mfomso ahorow, nanso minnim nea enti a ɛte saa.
Their eyes think about it.	Wɔn ani susuw ho.
But this doesn’t work.	Nanso eyi ntumi nyɛ adwuma.
I had plenty of time	Ná mewɔ bere pii
I know almost nothing about him.	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ minnim ne ho hwee.
I was taken home early	Wɔde me kɔɔ fie ntɛm
That doesn’t matter now.	Ɛno ho nhia mprempren.
I had never really thought of it that way	Ná minsusuw ho saa ankasa da
A cold day.	Da a awɔw wom.
There are no other images in the film.	Mfonini foforo biara nni sini no mu.
But he does have one.	Nanso ɔwɔ bi.
Give us the good stuff.	Fa nneɛma pa no ma yɛn.
I can never do that	Mintumi nyɛ saa da
I think about it all the time	Misusuw ho bere nyinaa
A man is on top of her.	Ɔbarima bi wɔ ne so.
Better than the last game.	Ɛyɛ papa sen agoru a etwa to no.
Many have, it’s true.	Pii ayɛ saa, ɛyɛ nokware.
You have to give it some thought.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wususuw ho kakra.
We just have to do it.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ ara kwa.
You don’t have anything to say.	Wo nnya biribiara a wobɛka.
I was terrible for them today	Na meyɛ hu ma wɔn nnɛ
I saw you outside his apartment yesterday	Mihuu wo wɔ ne dan akyi nnɛra
He has no idea what information to give.	Onni nsɛm a ɔde bɛma ho adwene biara.
I wanted to give him the job	Ná mepɛ sɛ mede adwuma no ma no
Many other things.	Nneɛma foforo pii.
I did well for the most part	Meyɛɛ yiye wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu
You want to know why music matters to them.	Wopɛ sɛ wuhu nea enti a nnwom ho hia wɔn.
I want to take care of you	Mepɛ sɛ mehwɛ wo
Time to sleep.	Bere a wɔde da.
I want to stay home with you	Mepɛ sɛ me ne wo tra fie
I couldn’t feel his hand	Na mintumi nte ne nsa nka
However, this method is expensive.	Nanso, saa kwan yi ho ka yɛ den.
Get a little more committed to your routine.	Fa wo ho kakra hyɛ wo nhyehyɛe no mu.
I want it so bad.	Mepɛ sɛ ɛyɛ bɔne saa.
He wasn’t doing anything.	Ná ɔnyɛ hwee.
I think it’s true	Misusuw sɛ ɛyɛ nokware
I brought him here	Mede no baa ha
Everyone liked him.	Ná obiara ani gye ne ho.
It was better than the truth.	Ná eye sen nokware no.
I have to tell you this	Ɛsɛ sɛ meka eyi kyerɛ wo
I was doing it for us	Ná mereyɛ ama yɛn
And he had the best party.	Na ɔyɛɛ apontow a eye sen biara.
And that trend continued.	Na saa su no kɔɔ so.
But it isn’t.	Nanso ɛnte saa.
As if he knew.	Te sɛ nea onim.
Other than that, there was nothing remarkable about it.	Sɛ ɛno da nkyɛn a, na biribiara nni hɔ a ɛyɛ nwonwa wɔ ho.
It’s kind of weird.	Ɛyɛ nwonwa bi.
I could have watched them all day	Anka metumi ahwɛ wɔn da mũ nyinaa
It’s not there anymore.	Ɛho nni hɔ bio.
I don’t think they do.	Minsusuw sɛ wɔyɛ saa.
I sleep well at home	Meda yiye wɔ fie
I took him home and gave him my bed	Mede no kɔɔ fie na mede me mpa maa no
You can tell them the same thing.	Wubetumi aka akyerɛ wɔn saa ara.
She was beautiful tonight.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ anadwo yi.
I had only one thought now	Ná mewɔ adwene biako pɛ mprempren
It was painful to the touch.	Ná ɛyɛ yaw bere a wɔde wɔn nsa ka no.
We’re interested in it.	Yɛn ani gye ho.
I intend to give it my best	Meyɛ m’adwene sɛ mede nea metumi biara bɛma no
His hands were warm.	Ná ne nsa yɛ hyew.
Also check for other errors.	Hwɛ nso sɛ mfomso foforo biara nni hɔ.
You can’t go on like that.	Worentumi nkɔ so saa.
I can definitely work with this now	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ metumi de eyi ayɛ adwuma mprempren
I want to thank everyone for this.	Mepɛ sɛ meda obiara ase wɔ eyi ho.
I am too fast for him.	Meyɛ ntɛmntɛm dodo ma no.
The same is true of information.	Saa ara na ɛte wɔ nsɛm ho.
The whole group doesn’t.	Kuw no nyinaa nyɛ saa.
I can't deal with this right now	Mintumi nni eyi ho dwuma mprempren
And this is very important here.	Na eyi ho hia kɛse wɔ ha.
My mother lived here.	Ná me maame te ha.
I need to forget about him	Ɛsɛ sɛ me werɛ fi ne ho asɛm
I did, a long time ago	Meyɛɛ saa, bere tenten a atwam ni
I couldn’t have been better	Na mintumi nyɛ papa sen saa
It’s like a good movie.	Ɛte sɛ sini pa bi.
The gaze on the table hardened again for him.	Ani a wɔde hwɛɛ pon no so no san yɛɛ den maa no.
I knew you were good at something	Ná minim sɛ wo ho akokwaw wɔ biribi ho
However, this is a bit of work to do.	Nanso, eyi yɛ adwuma kakra a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
And it didn’t matter to me.	Na ɛnyɛ me asɛm.
But here is a strange problem.	Nanso ɔhaw bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa ni.
I want you to tell me	Mepɛ sɛ woka
I’m glad you forgot about me	M’ani gye ho sɛ wo werɛ fii me
I had never thought of it that way.	Ná minsusuw ho saa da.
That’s what was so hard.	Ɛno ne nea na ɛyɛ den yiye.
I should have been in my car already	Anka ɛsɛ sɛ mewɔ me kar no mu dedaw
I don't know why this is.	Minnim nea enti a eyi te saa.
Will someone tell me what not to do.	So obi bɛka nea menyɛ akyerɛ me.
This is how powerful you are.	Eyi ne sɛnea wowɔ tumi.
Put that aside.	Fa saa asɛm no to nkyɛn.
His son had seen it.	Ná ne ba no ahu.
What is true is true and what is false is false.	Nea ɛyɛ nokware no yɛ nokware na nea ɛyɛ atoro no yɛ atoro.
A winter day can be beautiful	Awɔw bere mu da betumi ayɛ fɛ
I don’t know where it is here	Minnim baabi a ɛwɔ ha
However, things started badly.	Nanso, nneɛma fii ase bɔne.
I was the only child there	Ná me nkutoo ne abofra a ɔwɔ hɔ
But there is more going on than just this.	Nanso nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛrekɔ so sen eyi ara kwa.
However, you have to do it right.	Nanso, ɛsɛ sɛ woyɛ no yiye.
That, too, is a mistake	Ɛno nso yɛ mfomso
There is something for everyone.	Biribi wɔ hɔ ma obiara.
I had to find out what happened	Ná ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea esii
I can always reach them that way	Metumi adu wɔn nkyɛn saa kwan no so bere nyinaa
I didn’t want to do that anymore.	Ná mempɛ sɛ meyɛ saa bio.
So thank you for yours.	Enti meda mo ase.
Tell them that story.	Ka saa asɛm no kyerɛ wɔn.
But he doesn’t do that anymore.	Nanso ɔnyɛ saa bio.
I wanted to know what was going on	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu nea ɛrekɔ so
And we all do that.	Na yɛn nyinaa yɛ saa.
But the situation was the same.	Nanso na tebea no te sɛ nea ɛte.
It just seemed so good.	Ná ɛte sɛ nea eye ara kwa.
It’s all about that last part.	Ne nyinaa fa saa fã a etwa to no ho.
It was important.	Ná ɛho hia.
He was just a good person.	Ná ɔyɛ onipa pa ara kwa.
Two of my favorite characters.	Nnipa baanu a m’ani gye wɔn ho paa.
I don’t want to go anywhere else.	Mempɛ sɛ mekɔ baabi foforo biara.
I was one of them.	Ná meyɛ biako.
I can’t think of anything else but you	Mintumi nsusuw biribi foforo biara ho gye wo
It seems better than that.	Ɛte sɛ nea eye sen saa.
There’s definitely more in the game.	Akyinnye biara nni ho sɛ pii wɔ agoru no mu.
This is immediate.	Eyi yɛ ntɛm ara.
I wanted to be happy	Ná mepɛ sɛ m’ani gye
In the present case, none of these factors exist.	Wɔ mprempren asɛm yi mu no, nneɛma yi mu biara nni hɔ.
I can take you there	Metumi de wo akɔ hɔ
The other children were gone.	Ná mmofra a aka no nni hɔ bio.
And the things he does well.	Na nneɛma a ɔyɛ no yiye no nso.
That in itself felt great.	Ɛno ankasa tee nka sɛ ɛyɛ kɛse.
I had a surprise for him	Ná mewɔ biribi a ɛyɛ nwonwa ma no
I have to work tonight anyway	Ɛsɛ sɛ meyɛ adwuma anadwo yi ɔkwan biara so
In a sense, though, they were disappointed.	Nanso, ɔkwan biako so no, na wɔn abam abu.
It’s a job.	Ɛyɛ adwuma bi.
He has to do it then.	Ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ saa bere no.
He was a child again.	Ná ɔyɛ abofra bio.
I only know what he told me.	Nea ɔka kyerɛɛ me nkutoo na minim.
I don’t just want you on the team.	Ɛnyɛ sɛ mepɛ sɛ wowɔ kuw no mu kɛkɛ.
It seems to be empty.	Ɛte sɛ nea hwee nni mu.
That’s a long time.	Ɛno yɛ bere tenten.
However, it is not accurate.	Nanso, ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware.
I wouldn't want you to touch me	Anka mempɛ sɛ wo nsa bɛka me
I couldn’t eat anything.	Ná mintumi nni hwee.
A week or so later it was the hair	Dapɛn biako anaa nea ɛte saa akyi no na ɛyɛ ti nhwi no
He didn't want to lie to her.	Ná ɔmpɛ sɛ odi atoro kyerɛ no.
I wanted to know your name	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu wo din
I can't go through that anymore	Mintumi mfa saa asɛm no mu bio
Mom was working.	Ná Maame yɛ adwuma.
Not their faces.	Ɛnyɛ wɔn anim.
I know how much you love me	Minim sɛnea wopɛ me kɛse
Think carefully about whether you want this.	Susuw ho yiye sɛ ebia wopɛ eyi anaa.
A man headed outside.	Ɔbarima bi de n’ani kyerɛɛ abɔnten.
I can't get out what's going on	Mintumi mfa nea ɛrekɔ so no mfi adi
Someone said it was too hot.	Obi kae sɛ na ɛyɛ hyew dodo.
The truth is that.	Nokware no ne sɛ.
You really look like another person.	Wo ho te sɛ onipa foforo ankasa.
The problem seems similar to this case.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɔhaw no te sɛ asɛm yi.
Work with people.	Wo ne nkurɔfo nyɛ adwuma.
This applies to books, too.	Eyi fa nhoma ahorow ho, nso.
Suppose now that .	Fa no mprempren sɛ .
You will do it overnight.	Wobɛyɛ anadwo biako pɛ.
No one spoke, and he didn’t know what was going on.	Obiara ankasa, na na onnim nea ɛrekɔ so.
He wasn’t perfect, but no one is.	Ná ɔnyɛ pɛ, nanso obiara nni hɔ a ɔyɛ pɛ.
He, not so sure.	Ɔno, ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware saa.
Maybe he could do that now.	Ebia na obetumi ayɛ saa mprempren.
I need to know why my group was like that	Ɛsɛ sɛ mihu nea enti a na me kuw no te saa
I really liked them	M’ani gyee wɔn ho ankasa
I didn’t know he was in this town.	Na minnim sɛ ɔwɔ kurow yi mu.
I used that gun for years and loved it.	Mede saa tuo no dii dwuma mfe pii na m’ani gyee ho.
I have been here in town ever since	Mewɔ kurow no mu ha fi saa bere no
He could have had one.	Ná obetumi anya bi.
So did I, by the way.	Saa ara na me nso, ɔkwan bi so no.
I knew there wasn't much he could do	Ná minim sɛ nneɛma pii nni hɔ a obetumi ayɛ
Where everyone knows everyone.	Baabi a obiara nim obiara.
I made my bed and all	Meyɛɛ me mpa ne ne nyinaa
It’s my wisdom.	Ɛyɛ me nyansa.
We conclude that it is.	Yɛde ba awiei sɛ ɛte saa.
Truth is not necessary.	Nokware ho nhia.
Say that, you know, from yourself.	Ka saa, wunim, fi wo ho.
And so did everyone else here.	Na obiara a ɔwɔ ha nso yɛɛ saa ara.
I knew why, but I couldn't say anything	Ná minim nea enti a ɛte saa, nanso na mintumi nka hwee
I knew how those kids felt at the time	Ná minim sɛnea saa mmofra no te nka saa bere no
If he is that good.	Sɛ ɔyɛ papa saa a.
But we have to rely on someone.	Nanso ɛsɛ sɛ yɛde yɛn ho to obi so.
He can save himself.	Obetumi agye ne ho.
I wanted to, to be honest	Ná mepɛ, sɛ mɛka nokware a
I wasn’t happy with myself	Ná m’ani nnye me ho
I didn't know it was your gun	Ná minnim sɛ ɛyɛ wo tuo no
Which I just couldn’t do	Nea na mintumi nyɛ ara kwa
I love my home here	M’ani gye me fie ho wɔ ha
It was a beautiful day and everyone was out.	Ná ɛyɛ da a ɛyɛ fɛ na na obiara afi adi.
I didn’t know him well enough	Ná minnim no yiye sɛnea ɛsɛ
I want my new life back	Mepɛ sɛ me nkwa foforo no san ba
For the most part this is great.	Wɔ fã kɛse no ara mu no eyi yɛ kɛse.
I didn’t think he wanted me	Na minsusuw sɛ ɔpɛ me
I couldn't believe how hot that made her	Ná mintumi nnye nni sɛnea ɛno maa ne ho yɛɛ hyew no
I couldn’t let this get the better of me	Na mintumi mma eyi nni me ho so
It doesn’t matter at all.	Ɛnyɛ hwee koraa.
I have a lot to think about	Mewɔ nneɛma pii a ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw ho
That seems to be the case.	Ɛno te sɛ nea ɛte saa.
They are all the same.	Wɔn nyinaa yɛ ade koro.
I just thought you did	Misusuwii ara kwa sɛ woyɛ saa
I hope you had a good day	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ mo nyaa da pa
They are bad people.	Wɔyɛ nnipa bɔne.
That’s why it doesn’t matter to him.	Ɛno nti na ɛho nhia no.
I want to get involved	Mepɛ sɛ mede me ho hyɛ mu
I couldn’t think of them.	Na mintumi nsusuw wɔn ho.
And after that, too.	Na ɛno akyi nso.
I think he will be fine	Misusuw sɛ ne ho bɛtɔ no
Or it was, at least.	Anaasɛ na ɛyɛ, anyɛ yiye koraa no.
I just want you to know one thing	Mepɛ sɛ wuhu ade biako pɛ
I see something else	Mihu biribi foforo
It was good that way.	Ná eye saa kwan no so.
I just didn't know why	Ná minnim nea enti a ɛte saa ara kwa
If only it were that simple.	Sɛ anka ɛyɛ mmerɛw saa a.
He is not the man he used to be.	Ɔnyɛ ɔbarima a na ɔyɛ kan no.
Twice too many.	Mpɛn abien dodo.
I do this, every day	Meyɛ eyi, da biara da
I will be the story you tell your children	Me na mɛyɛ asɛm a wobɛka ho asɛm akyerɛ wo mma no
The lesson is really about us.	Adesua no fa yɛn ho ankasa.
I enjoyed the study.	M’ani gyee adesua no ho.
I should never have done anything with you	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ me ne wo nyɛ hwee da
I still can’t do that.	Meda so ara ntumi nyɛ saa.
We can and must do better.	Yebetumi ayɛ yiye na ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ saa.
Other days, not at all.	Nna foforo nso, ɛnte saa koraa.
That felt great.	Ɛno tee nka kɛse.
There are no police anymore.	Polisifo nni hɔ bio.
That’s a full three hours.	Ɛno yɛ nnɔnhwerew abiɛsa a edi mũ.
I shouldn’t have brought them here	Anka ɛnsɛ sɛ mede wɔn ba ha
I never knew about this.	Ná minnim eyi ho asɛm da.
Don’t tell anything about yourself.	Nka nkyerɛ wo ho hwee.
I'm with you.	Me ne wo.
I want two portraits of each person	Mepɛ sɛ wɔyɛ onipa biara mfonini abien
I can’t do that	Mintumi nyɛ saa
I couldn’t understand them either	Ná mintumi nte wɔn nso ase
It’s only too good.	Ɛyɛ papa dodo nkutoo.
I immediately fell in love with him	M’ani gyee ne ho ntɛm ara
There is a coldness.	Awɔw bi wɔ hɔ.
I loved that about my dad	M’ani gyee saa asɛm no ho wɔ me papa ho
But he was busy.	Nanso na onni adagyew.
I think about the house, the clothes, the food	Misusuw ofie no, ntade no, aduan no ho
I was very impressed	M’ani gyee ho kɛse
I was powerless to do anything about it	Ná minni tumi biara sɛ mɛyɛ ho hwee
There is a group for anyone and everyone.	Kuw bi wɔ hɔ ma obiara ne obiara.
Be the reason for it.	Yɛ nea enti a ɛte saa.
Many of the books are about beautiful conventions.	Nhoma ahorow no pii fa nhyiam ahorow a ɛyɛ fɛ ho.
I have a wonderful story.	Mewɔ asɛm bi a ɛyɛ nwonwa.
I hoped he never had lunch	Ná mewɔ anidaso sɛ na onni awia aduan da
That was the point.	Ná ɛno ne asɛm no.
I showed him the story.	Mede asɛm no kyerɛɛ no.
A new house and car for my mother.	Ofie foforo ne kar ma me maame.
I was in a great mood this morning.	Na mewɔ adwene kɛse mu anɔpa yi.
Or lie down for two hours. 	Anaasɛ da fam nnɔnhwerew abien. 
I understood and nodded	Metee ase na mede me ti too fam
I thought about that all the time	Ná misusuw saa asɛm no ho bere nyinaa
There was no way he didn't know about this.	Ɔkwan biara nni hɔ a na onnim eyi ho asɛm.
That, to me, is not a better situation.	Ɛno, wɔ me fam no, ɛnyɛ tebea a eye sen saa.
Do you see any other three on the table.	So wuhu abiɛsa foforo biara wɔ pon no so.
Not easy, not powerful, not quick.	Ɛnyɛ mmerɛw, ɛnyɛ tumi, ɛnyɛ ntɛm.
I wish they didn’t have to	Me yam a anka ɛnsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ
Still a lot of fun.	Da so ara yɛ anigye pii.
A great man indeed.	Onipa kɛse ampa.
They were such fun.	Ná wɔyɛ anigye a ɛte saa.
More are added every day.	Wɔde pii ka ho da biara da.
Great problem and great opportunity	Ɔhaw kɛse ne hokwan kɛse
That number can be good or bad.	Saa dodow no betumi ayɛ papa anaa bɔne.
I didn't know if he worked or not.	Ná minnim sɛ ɔyɛ adwuma anaasɛ ɔnyɛ adwuma.
I love our house.	M’ani gye yɛn fie ho.
I just want to be honest with you	Nea mepɛ ara ne sɛ mɛka nokware akyerɛ wo
I knew that from their reactions.	Ná minim saa sɛnea wɔyɛ wɔn ade no.
But no one comes.	Nanso obiara mma.
I saw the look on all their faces	Mihuu sɛnea wɔn anim nyinaa te
I think that’s a little weird	Misusuw sɛ ɛno yɛ nwonwa kakra
Nothing like the original.	Biribiara nni hɔ a ɛte sɛ nea edi kan no.
People look at me.	Nkurɔfo hwɛ me.
I brought my friends to the old house	Mede me nnamfo baa ofie dedaw no mu
Handshakes in the hands.	Nsa a wɔde hyɛ nsa.
See also here.	Hwɛ ha nso.
At least that’s the idea.	Anyɛ yiye koraa no, ɛno ne adwene no.
He was really at home.	Ná ɔwɔ fie ankasa.
He is not a terrible person.	Ɔnyɛ obi a ne ho yɛ hu.
I need to think about this.	Ɛsɛ sɛ misusuw eyi ho.
I just got off the phone with them	Me ne wɔn fii telefon no so ara pɛ
So much money.	Sika pii saa.
I heard a loud knock on my door	Metee sɛ obi rebɔ me pon mu denneennen
Here are some more details on that.	Ɛno ho nsɛm foforo bi ni.
Even this same hand.	Saa nsa koro yi ara mpo.
I had a little problem.	Ná mewɔ ɔhaw kakra bi.
You seem to believe it.	Ɛte sɛ nea wugye di.
I wasn't too strong	Ná me ho nyɛ me den dodo
But he had to act quickly.	Nanso na ɛsɛ sɛ ɔyɛ ho biribi ntɛm.
Many of them.	Wɔn mu pii.
Another face with pictures	Anim foforo a mfonini wom
I couldn’t convince him otherwise	Na mintumi mma no nnye nni sɛ ɛnte saa
Currently, there is no such test.	Mprempren, sɔhwɛ biara nni hɔ a ɛte saa.
I really want to thank you all so much	Mepɛ sɛ meda mo nyinaa ase pii ankasa
We both have to be there.	Ɛsɛ sɛ yɛn baanu nyinaa wɔ hɔ.
A story like a dog	Asɛm bi te sɛ ɔkraman
I wanted to be like him	Ná mepɛ sɛ me ne no yɛ pɛ
Not the easiest, obviously.	Ɛnyɛ nea ɛyɛ mmerɛw koraa, ɛda adi sɛ.
Two years later, opportunity knocked again	Mfe abien akyi no, hokwan no san bɔɔ mu bio
They are really quite bad.	Wɔyɛ bɔne koraa ankasa.
I saw his strong, graceful hands	Mihuu ne nsa a ɛyɛ den na ɛyɛ fɛ no
I was always good at it.	Ná meyɛ ho yiye bere nyinaa.
I glanced at them	Mede m’ani kyerɛɛ wɔn
I wanted to know everything about him	Ná mepɛ sɛ mihu ne ho biribiara
Like a squirrel.	Te sɛ ɔkraman.
There was someone here.	Ná obi wɔ ha.
But I expected the same	Nanso na mehwɛ kwan saa ara
I hope you can help me.	Mewɔ anidaso sɛ wubetumi aboa me.
It should be included in the plans.	Ɛsɛ sɛ wɔde ka nhyehyɛe ahorow no ho.
It will be a dangerous job.	Ɛbɛyɛ adwuma a asiane wom.
He, too, promises them.	Ɔno nso de wɔn hyɛ bɔ.
I feel terrible about this	Mete nka sɛ ɛyɛ hu wɔ eyi ho
I could barely do it	Ɛkame ayɛ sɛ na mintumi nyɛ
I wish you the best tomorrow evening	Mepɛ sɛ woyɛ nea eye sen biara ɔkyena anwummere
Process until almost smooth.	Fa yɛ adwuma kosi sɛ ɛkame ayɛ sɛ ɛbɛyɛ mmerɛw.
I want to think about it carefully	Mepɛ sɛ misusuw ho yiye
I drew closer to him	Mede me ho bɛn no kɛse
I really enjoyed that moment.	M’ani gyee saa bere no ho yiye.
And it really was.	Na ɛte saa ankasa.
And everything was really great.	Na na biribiara yɛ kɛse ankasa.
Everyone worries about me.	Obiara haw me ho.
I wondered if tomorrow would be just as busy	Misusuwii sɛ ebia ɔkyena nso bɛyɛ nea adagyew nnim saa ara anaa
I was feeling really strong now	Ná mete nka sɛ me ho yɛ den ankasa mprempren
I had no words to share	Ná minni nsɛm biara a mede bɛka ho asɛm
I just wish things had ended differently	Me yam a anka nneɛma baa awiei wɔ ɔkwan foforo so ara kwa
In this case, it might actually be the best option, too.	Wɔ eyi mu no, ebia ɛbɛyɛ ɔkwan a eye sen biara ankasa, nso.
I want to introduce you to someone	Mepɛ sɛ mede wo kyerɛ obi
I can only make it real with you	Metumi de ayɛ nea ɛyɛ nokware nkutoo wɔ wo nkyɛn
It just seems a little complicated to me.	Ɛte sɛ nea ɛyɛ den kakra kɛkɛ ma me.
You’ll get it.	Wo nsa bɛka.
However, I knew what we had to do	Nanso, na minim nea ɛsɛ sɛ yɛyɛ
I don't know why this is	Minnim nea enti a eyi te saa
She was very beautiful.	Ná ne ho yɛ fɛ yiye.
I don’t know what that is or would be.	Minnim nea ɛno yɛ anaasɛ anka ɛbɛyɛ.
He was very impressed.	N’ani gyee ho kɛse.
I knew what he was doing	Ná minim nea ɔreyɛ
A beautiful cold.	Awɔw a ɛyɛ fɛ.
There was so much to do.	Ná nneɛma pii wɔ hɔ a ɛsɛ sɛ wɔyɛ.
And I hope it’s you	Na mewɔ anidaso sɛ ɛyɛ wo
It was just an idea.	Ná ɛyɛ adwene bi kɛkɛ.
