You never know whether you will ever see them again.	O ko mọ boya o yoo ri wọn lẹẹkansi.
Nothing more than that.	Ko si ju o ṣe lọ.
They may stay for a while, they may not.	Wọn le duro fun igba diẹ, wọn le ma ṣe.
It will be the first week's game in a month.	Yoo jẹ ere ọsẹ akọkọ ni oṣu kan.
They need to love.	Wọn nilo lati nifẹ.
It is done over a long period of time.	O ti wa ni ṣe lori kan gun akoko ti akoko.
He said nothing to his father.	Ko si ohun ti o sọ fun baba rẹ.
I want to get out of there, fast.	Mo fẹ lati lọ kuro nibẹ, yara.
Very low performance.	Iṣẹ ṣiṣe kekere pupọ.
He just doesn’t like to tell you that you can’t do something.	O kan ko fẹran lati sọ fun ọ pe o ko le ṣe nkan kan.
I am trying to be your friend.	Mo n gbiyanju lati jẹ ọrẹ rẹ.
And, you know, you're right.	Ati pe, o mọ, o tọ.
I read them some names.	Mo ka wọn diẹ ninu awọn orukọ.
I have to see that for myself.	Mo ni lati wo iyẹn funrararẹ.
That they did not bring him back.	Wipe wọn ko mu u pada.
Write songs to pass the time.	Kọ awọn orin lati kọja akoko.
Women and men love these faces completely.	Awọn obinrin ati awọn ọkunrin fẹran awọn oju wọnyi patapata.
Now they pull on.	Bayi wọn fa lori.
If you work with me, this kind of thing will never happen again.	Ti o ba ṣiṣẹ pẹlu mi, iru eyi kii yoo ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
On a celebration.	Lori ayẹyẹ kan.
Don't tell me about it.	Maṣe sọ nipa mi fun u.
Your job is to take everything seriously.	Iṣẹ rẹ ni lati mu ohun gbogbo ni pataki.
I just want this class to end.	Mo kan fẹ ki kilasi yii pari.
I see what you mean by that.	Mo rii ohun ti o tumọ nipa iyẹn.
We feel bad.	A lero buburu.
I want to meet with you.	Mo fẹ lati pade pẹlu rẹ.
They have a very high opinion of their work too.	Wọn ni ero giga pupọ nipa iṣẹ wọn paapaa.
I see someone like you.	Mo ri ẹnikan bi iwọ.
You just need to make sure your boys understand.	O kan nilo lati rii daju pe awọn ọmọkunrin rẹ loye.
For me, that did not work.	Fun mi, iyẹn ko ṣiṣẹ.
The main purpose is to play music.	Idi akọkọ ni lati mu orin ṣiṣẹ.
Something good in the world of evil.	Nkankan ti o dara ni aye buburu.
It tastes good.	O dun inu.
Live long enough and some things will happen.	Gbe gun to ati diẹ ninu awọn ohun yoo ṣẹlẹ.
It looks pretty big.	O lẹwa nla.
It's your business.	Owo re ni.
I was the only one who thought.	Emi nikan ni mo ro.
You can completely.	O le patapata.
Do so.	Ṣe bẹ bẹ.
It makes me feel like a person of the year.	O jẹ ki n lero bi ẹni ti ọdun.
But just don’t like it.	Sugbon o kan ma ṣe fẹ.
Something went up.	Nkankan ti gbe soke.
The boys and girls ate lunch together.	Awọn ọmọkunrin ati awọn ọmọbirin jẹun ounjẹ ọsan papọ.
As you do not know it.	Bi o ko mọ ọ.
It will make this work.	O yoo ṣe eyi ṣiṣẹ.
Of course they are.	Dajudaju wọn jẹ.
It does not take long to make a decision.	O ko gba akoko pipẹ lati ṣe ipinnu.
Possibly, it probably never came out again.	O ṣee ṣe, o ṣee ṣe pe ko tii jade lẹẹkansi.
They will be new.	Wọn yoo jẹ tuntun.
Now he knows that the whole family is behind him.	Bayi o mọ pe gbogbo idile wa lẹhin rẹ.
That's why it's always hot.	Ti o ni idi ti o nigbagbogbo gbona.
I need to give him a better life in that situation.	Mo nilo lati fun u ni aye to dara julọ ni ipo yẹn.
That will not change.	Iyẹn kii yoo yipada.
The ideas are.	Awọn ero ni.
It is always cold.	O nigbagbogbo ni otutu.
These things have to be considered.	Awọn nkan wọnyi ni lati ṣe akiyesi.
I am not a man who thinks.	Emi kii ṣe ọkunrin ti o ro.
Okay, they can have.	O dara, wọn le ni.
They are one and the same, he decided.	Wọn jẹ ọkan ati kanna, o pinnu.
But it's getting late.	Sugbon o ti n pẹ.
Just another morning.	O kan owurọ miiran.
For two days now you will sleep with books.	Fun ọjọ meji bayi o yoo sun pẹlu awọn iwe.
We do not sleep and we do not wake up.	A ko sun ati pe a ko ji.
We have grown.	Ti a ti dagba.
They are called learning sessions.	A pe wọn ni awọn akoko ẹkọ.
I'm worried you might not notice it.	Mo ṣe aniyan pe o le ma ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
Understandably, it is very easy to understand.	Ni oye, o rọrun pupọ lati ni oye rẹ.
The field is starting to become that.	Aaye ti bẹrẹ lati di iyẹn.
Come when you arrive.	Wa nigbati o ba de.
Which you do not.	Eyi ti o ko.
It would be nice to see the truth.	Yoo dara lati rii otitọ.
We cannot find out who he is or is.	A ko le wa ẹniti o jẹ tabi jẹ.
We were afraid to go home for lunch.	A bẹru lati lọ si ile fun ounjẹ ọsan.
Such a thing is not possible.	Iru nkan bayi ko ṣee ṣe.
No, this has nothing to do with it.	Rara, eyi ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
They will not be there.	Wọn kii yoo wa nibẹ.
We went out for dinner and lunch the same day.	A jade lọ fun ounjẹ alẹ ati ounjẹ ọsan ni ọjọ kanna.
Her mother died when she was young.	Iya rẹ ku nigbati o wa ni ọdọ.
She was completely afraid of him.	O bẹru rẹ patapata.
He reached for the door.	O de ọwọ ilẹkun.
However, it was a well spent time.	Sibẹsibẹ, o jẹ akoko ti o lo daradara.
It deserves to work.	O yẹ lati ṣiṣẹ.
He even got up and ate some lunch.	Paapaa o dide o jẹ ounjẹ ọsan diẹ.
That will be important.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ pataki.
That is where we are again for others.	Iyẹn ni ibiti a tun wa fun awọn miiran.
That is the purpose of it.	Nkankan ti a fi se e niyen.
However he will.	Sibẹsibẹ oun yoo.
They can only live in their capacity.	Wọn le gbe nikan ni agbara wọn.
I am moving out.	Mo n gbe jade.
Fast food.	Ounjẹ yara yara.
Okay, there you go.	O dara, nibẹ ni o lọ.
It broke my heart all the time again.	O fọ ọkan mi ni gbogbo igba lẹẹkansi.
We also want.	A tun fẹ.
Only your hand.	Nikan ọwọ rẹ.
You have to go do that now.	O ni lati lọ ṣe iyẹn ni bayi.
We got back in the car and went home.	A pada sinu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ a si lọ si ile.
You need to know what to do when you hear something.	O nilo lati mọ kini lati ṣe nigbati o ba gbọ nkan kan.
He returned to the front.	O pada si iwaju.
But he was a man.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ọkunrin.
He has been living with a room since his arrival.	O ti n gbe pẹlu yara kan lati igba ti o ti de.
I'm glad you can find that moment.	Inu mi dun pe o le wa akoko naa.
The program is in place.	Eto naa wa ni ipo.
Most of your body is dead.	Pupọ julọ ti ara rẹ ti ku.
Your order has expired.	Ofin rẹ ti pari.
He does not know where he is from.	Ko mọ ibiti o ti wa.
Say a lot.	Sọ pupọ.
It was a beautiful summer's day.	O je kan lẹwa ooru ká ọjọ.
I want to look a little lower, you see.	Mo fẹ lati wo kekere diẹ labẹ, o rii.
It is working now.	O ti ṣiṣẹ ni bayi.
They play football the same way.	Wọn ṣe bọọlu ni ọna kanna.
He put another one.	O fi ọkan miiran.
I met my wife here.	Mo pade iyawo mi nibi.
I do not want to see what it is now.	Emi ko fẹ lati rii kini o wa ni bayi.
That is, of course.	Iyẹn ni, dajudaju.
I think it is very small.	Mo ro pe o kere pupọ.
Please accept our three.	Jọwọ gba awọn mẹta ti wa.
She turned to meet him.	O yipada lati pade rẹ.
And the police.	Ati ọlọpa.
He thought only of himself.	O ro ara rẹ nikan.
I do not know what it depends on.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o da lori.
I do not know what is wrong with this.	Emi ko mọ kini o jẹ aṣiṣe pẹlu eyi.
No man or woman is interested in you.	Ko si ọkunrin tabi obinrin kan ti o nifẹ si.
This just makes sense.	Eleyi kan mu ki ori.
It will take a lot of time.	Yoo gba akoko pupọ.
Education is one of those areas.	Ẹkọ jẹ ọkan ninu awọn agbegbe naa.
Okay, not this.	O dara, kii ṣe eyi.
That is what we want.	Ohun ti a fe niyen.
They are asking us to board the company train.	Wọn n beere lọwọ wa lati wọ ọkọ oju irin ile-iṣẹ naa.
He has been my best friend.	O ti awọn ọrẹ mi to dara julọ.
Not yours.	Kii ṣe tirẹ.
Taken on his own.	Ti mu lori ara rẹ.
In fact, most want to stay home.	Ni otitọ, pupọ julọ fẹ lati duro si ile.
Your story can change the world.	Itan rẹ le yi aye pada.
He saw the words but could not make them out.	O rii awọn ọrọ naa ṣugbọn ko le ṣe wọn jade.
But not too long.	Sugbon ko gun ju.
I couldn’t let myself eat too much.	Emi ko le jẹ ki ara mi jẹun pupọ.
Do not drop them into boxes.	Maṣe ju wọn sinu apoti nikan.
He wants to go to her.	O fẹ lati lọ si ọdọ rẹ.
So it starts here, high note.	Nitorina o bẹrẹ nibi, akiyesi ti o ga julọ.
The same method is used today.	Ọna kanna ni a lo loni.
None of them are correct.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o tọ.
And he does not know whether it will be easy to forget.	Ati pe ko mọ boya yoo rọrun lati gbagbe.
Are you from around here?	Ṣe o wa lati ayika ibi?
We fire at the same time.	A ṣe ina ni akoko kanna.
Every word you say is true.	Gbogbo ọrọ ti o sọ jẹ otitọ.
We don’t have to be here today.	A ko ni lati wa nibi loni.
We hate to give up.	A korira lati fun soke.
Find the phone.	Wa foonu naa.
You have to run your house.	O ni ṣiṣe ile rẹ.
It’s not that we’re going bad.	Kii ṣe pe a n lọ ni buburu.
We accept the question.	A gba ibeere naa.
Use it as a world to start again.	Lo o bi aye lati bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
You have dogs.	O ni awọn aja.
I think they are and have been for a very long time.	Mo ro pe wọn wa ati pe wọn ti wa fun igba pipẹ pupọ.
The sister is not good enough in the rain.	Arabinrin ko tii dara to ninu ojo.
However it worked out good for me.	Sibẹsibẹ o ṣiṣẹ jade dara fun mi.
I'm sorry, but no.	Ma binu, sugbon rara.
And in these moments he has drawn to them.	Ati ni awọn akoko wọnyi o ti fa si wọn.
And for that, I need life from you.	Ati fun iyẹn, Mo nilo aye lati ọdọ rẹ.
Of course it does not help that his ex-wife died in the fire.	Dajudaju ko ṣe iranlọwọ pe iyawo rẹ atijọ ku ninu ina.
In fact child, this is not true.	Ni otitọ ọmọ, eyi kii ṣe otitọ.
Her father is dead.	Baba rẹ ti ku.
I know my father.	Mo mọ baba mi.
I don’t think it is.	Emi ko ro pe o jẹ.
It is used to nothing.	O ti lo si ohunkohun.
Their idea is ambition.	Ero wọn jẹ ifẹ agbara.
Even you look at it.	Paapaa o wo lo.
Something completely obvious.	Ohun ti o han patapata.
Obviously, this will take some time.	O han ni, eyi yoo gba akoko diẹ.
I will find work.	Emi yoo wa iṣẹ.
I don't know if it's perfect.	Emi ko mọ pe o pe.
I was wrong.	Mo ṣe aṣiṣe.
He kept his word.	O pa ọrọ rẹ mọ.
He lost, and a hand pushed him back.	O padanu, ọwọ kan si ti i pada sẹhin.
Do not eat other dogs.	Maṣe jẹ awọn aja miiran.
I enjoyed the book but it was nothing special.	Mo gbadun iwe naa ṣugbọn kii ṣe ohunkohun pataki.
Some still do.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣi ṣe.
You can see it in person.	O le wo rẹ ni oju.
Dogs are more like humans.	Awọn aja jẹ diẹ ninu bi eniyan.
That way you can do whatever you want to do.	Ni ọna yẹn o le ṣe ohunkohun ti o fẹ lati ṣe.
Two months ago he asked her.	Ni oṣu meji sẹhin o beere lọwọ rẹ.
I'll drop you off.	Emi yoo sare ọ silẹ.
It would be nice to know how to do it.	Yoo dara lati mọ bi a ṣe le ṣe.
I want to know if anything has changed.	Mo fẹ lati mọ boya ohunkohun ti yipada.
But nothing came of it.	Sugbon ko si ohun to wa si i.
It is good to return new values.	O dara lati da awọn iye tuntun pada.
Her son was sitting in a car nearby.	Ọmọkunrin rẹ joko ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan nitosi.
It was the morning we left.	O wa ni owurọ ti a lọ.
We will need a large boat.	A yoo nilo ọkọ oju omi nla kan.
Anything you say can and will be applied to you.	Ohunkohun ti o sọ le ati pe yoo ṣee lo si ọ.
They have dropped a lot since then.	Wọn ti lọ silẹ pupọ lati igba naa.
That opportunity is no longer known.	Anfani yẹn ko si mọ.
It should not be long.	Ko yẹ ki o gun.
Many of them, of course.	Pupọ ninu wọn, dajudaju.
They say they do it three times a week.	Wọn sọ pe wọn ṣe ni igba mẹta ni ọsẹ kan.
They are important.	Wọn ṣe pataki.
I will play as a personal friend of everyone who works here.	Emi yoo mu bi ọrẹ ti ara ẹni gbogbo eniyan ti o ṣiṣẹ nibi.
Try to find out what happened.	Gbiyanju ki o wa ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
And there is so much more.	Ati pe o wa pupọ diẹ sii.
The days are over.	Awọn ọjọ ti wọ lori.
Some children go to special schools.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọde lọ si awọn ile-iwe pataki.
I am still in school.	Mo tun wa ni ile-iwe.
Soon he heard about it.	Laipẹ o gbọ nipa rẹ.
They just want to meet them.	Wọn kan fẹ lati pade wọn.
It was a morning like this.	O jẹ owurọ bi eyi.
He will not go for long.	Oun kii yoo lọ fun pipẹ.
In the end the cost will come to that.	Ni ipari iye owo yoo wa si iyẹn.
Will you be able to attend the meeting?	Ṣe iwọ yoo ni anfani lati lọ si ipade?
It is stuck as a device.	O ti wa ni di bi a ẹrọ.
No one is interested in hearing that.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o nifẹ lati gbọ iyẹn.
They are long gone.	Wọn ti pẹ ti lọ.
He did something for me that he never knew about.	O ṣe ohun kan fun mi ti ko ni mọ nipa rẹ.
The question is a very important one.	Ibeere naa jẹ pataki pataki.
Okay, it looks like that.	O dara, o dabi iyẹn.
We left the car.	A fi ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ silẹ.
Now that’s important.	Bayi iyẹn ṣe pataki.
Can you see the lights of the city?	Ṣe o le rii awọn ina ti ilu naa?
They do not deserve to die.	Wọn ko yẹ lati ku.
But it is an old story and perhaps not true.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ itan atijọ ati boya kii ṣe otitọ.
One of the most beautiful walks in town.	Ọkan ninu awọn julọ lẹwa rin ni ilu.
Bread makes the bread.	Akara ṣe akara naa.
You have nothing bad to say about it.	O ko ni nkankan buburu lati sọ nipa rẹ.
I love that, especially.	Mo nifẹ iyẹn, paapaa.
Nor will your mother.	Tabi yoo iya rẹ.
Exalt yourself.	Di ara rẹ ga.
He even has the ability to see even though he has no visible face.	O paapaa ni agbara lati ri bi o ti jẹ pe ko ni oju ti o han.
He had seen everything, and he still came running after me.	O ti ri ohun gbogbo, ati awọn ti o si tun wa si sare lẹhin mi.
There is no other reason.	Ko si idi miiran.
I want to be with you more.	Mo fẹ lati wa pẹlu rẹ diẹ sii.
There is so much power here that what can be done.	Agbara pupọ wa nibi ti ohun ti o le ṣee ṣe.
But there are many around this area.	Ṣugbọn ọpọlọpọ wa ni ayika agbegbe yii.
It makes no sense.	O ko ni ori.
I am not a mother either.	Emi naa kii ṣe iya.
You don’t even have to get back into the boat.	O ko paapaa ni lati pada si inu ọkọ oju omi.
We don’t think much about it.	A ko ronu pupọ nipa rẹ.
I may be tired.	Eniyan le ti re mi.
I don't want to go back to school.	Emi ko fẹ lati pada si ile-iwe.
The sun was about to rise.	Oorun ti bẹrẹ lati dide.
I have a plan.	Mo ni eto kan.
I have too much to do.	Mo ni pupo ju lati ṣe.
My bed is calling my name.	Ibusun mi n pe orukọ mi.
Not that he would bathe, because he did not know how.	Kii ṣe pe oun yoo wẹ, nitori ko mọ bii.
At least, not in a good way.	O kere ju, kii ṣe ni ọna ti o dara.
Hope this helps someone.	Lero yi iranlọwọ ẹnikan.
You do not need to.	O ko nilo lati.
It is too hot for the river today.	O gbona ju fun odo loni.
But that gives us something to work with.	Ṣugbọn eyi ti fun wa ni nkankan lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
You want to buy as a gift.	O fẹ ra bi ẹbun.
Not everyone can do it.	Ko gbogbo eniyan le ṣe.
Some accept it.	Diẹ ninu awọn gba o.
It should be used for three years.	O yẹ lati lo fun ọdun mẹta.
You had hoped all that.	O ti nireti gbogbo iyẹn.
Dad all the time.	Baba ni gbogbo akoko.
The family moved across the ocean.	Ebi gbe kọja okun.
They have no one, no reason for.	Wọn ko ni ọkan, ko si idi fun.
He is leaving us.	O n fi wa silẹ.
Call when you say you will call.	Pe nigbati o sọ pe iwọ yoo pe.
Meeting for lunch.	Ipade fun ọsan.
Which most of them need.	Eyi ti ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn nilo.
Even now you can do that.	Paapaa ni bayi o le ṣe iyẹn.
Not his wife.	Kii ṣe iyawo rẹ.
Her brother did.	Arakunrin rẹ ṣe.
For in the books they write they continue to exist.	Fun ninu awọn iwe ti wọn kọ wọn tẹsiwaju lati wa.
I hope you have.	Mo nireti pe o ni.
I am out of town.	Mo ti wa ni ita ilu.
That will always be true.	Iyẹn nigbagbogbo yoo jẹ otitọ.
Anything can happen, you know.	Ohunkohun le ṣẹlẹ, o mọ.
You change your mind to what we did in the past.	O yi ọkan rẹ si ohun ti a se ti o ti kọja.
This car is very fast.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yii yara gaan.
But don't go.	Ṣugbọn maṣe lọ.
It just gets things wrong, again and again and again and again.	O kan n ni awọn nkan ti ko tọ, lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
They hurried away.	Wọn yara lọ.
Do not give them a minute's rest.	Maṣe fun wọn ni isinmi iṣẹju kan.
Hard to walk away.	Gidigidi lati rin kuro.
I told you before.	Mo ti sọ fun ọ tẹlẹ.
Han jade.	Han jade.
You look off to the side.	O wo pa si ẹgbẹ.
He is still alone.	O tun wa nikan.
The site is also one of the promising.	Aaye naa tun jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ti o ni ileri.
Children will return to school.	Awọn ọmọde yoo pada si ile-iwe.
Friend for your request.	Ọrẹ fun ibeere rẹ.
Or a bad person.	Tabi eniyan buburu.
His.	Tirẹ.
But I don’t know one of that.	Ṣugbọn ko mọ ọkan ninu iyẹn.
He was going to hide and stand it out.	O si ti lọ lati tọju ati ki o duro ti o jade.
They needed their rest.	Wọn ti nilo isinmi wọn.
Something about your face and.	Nkankan nipa oju rẹ ati .
So something is wrong.	Nitorina nkankan ti ko tọ.
However, there are two groups.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ẹgbẹ meji wa.
Not for a while, he said.	Kii ṣe fun igba diẹ, o sọ.
Contact them for what you need to do.	Kan si wọn fun ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe.
This or something.	Eyi tabi nkankan.
All you can do.	Gbogbo ohun ti o le ṣe.
His eyes are anxious, but determined.	Oju rẹ jẹ aniyan, ṣugbọn ipinnu.
However, any promises about the money you make, you keep.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyikeyi ileri nipa owo ti o ṣe, o pa.
It has been hard work to look forward to.	O ti jẹ iṣẹ lile ti o nireti.
Things need to change.	Awọn nkan nilo lati yipada.
Exit while you can still.	Jade nigba ti o tun le.
The trees have grown a lot in the last three years.	Awọn igi ti dagba pupọ ni ọdun mẹta sẹhin.
They often go to the beach.	Nigbagbogbo wọn lọ si eti okun.
Someone special.	Ẹnikan ti pataki.
Can't say.	Ko le sọ.
It can mean life.	O le tumọ si igbesi aye.
You are very beautiful.	O lẹwa pupọ.
In this case they are not locked.	Ni idi eyi wọn ko tii.
The tea is hot.	Tii naa ti mu gbona.
There is no world of that here.	Ko si aye ti iyẹn nibi.
Time to die.	Akoko lati ku.
Sometimes things come together in a good way and it feels great.	Nigba miiran awọn nkan wa papọ ni ọna ti o dara ati pe o lero nla.
I have to have.	Mo ni lati ni.
I have nothing on it now.	Emi ko ni nkankan lori rẹ bayi.
Just wait for him to decide his one.	O kan duro fun u lati pinnu ọkan rẹ.
It should have been back for him.	O yẹ ki o ti pada fun u.
The object appears in two places.	Nkan naa han ni awọn aaye meji.
There is no idea if that is true.	Ko si imọran ti iyẹn ba jẹ otitọ.
Time becomes important to them now.	Akoko di pataki fun wọn ni bayi.
Wait a minute.	Duro fun iṣẹju kan.
The rooms are downstairs.	Awọn yara wa ni isalẹ.
Not only do our girls love it.	Kii ṣe awọn ọmọbirin wa nikan nifẹ rẹ.
I just want to go out and do it.	Mo kan fẹ lati jade lọ ṣe.
It is not possible to get married with everyone.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati ṣe igbeyawo pẹlu gbogbo eniyan.
Two observations were made.	Awọn akiyesi meji ni a ri.
I can’t make you look like my mother.	Emi ko le jẹ ki o dabi iya mi.
He is not here for me.	Ko wa nibi fun mi.
Your fault or not, you have everything.	Aṣiṣe rẹ tabi rara, o ni ohun gbogbo.
Other than that it should work.	Miiran ju pe o yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
He has it now, you know.	O ni o ni bayi, o mọ.
Haven't heard it for years.	Ti ko ti gbọ o fun ọdun.
Not feeling, it's hot.	Ko rilara, o gbona.
None of them heard me.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o gbọ mi.
It is decided.	O ti pinnu.
This can damage the driver.	Eyi le ba awakọ jẹ.
I will of course return.	Emi yoo dajudaju pada.
They will buy your device and everything.	Wọn yoo ra ẹrọ rẹ ati ohun gbogbo.
The police are human too!	Awọn ọlọpa jẹ eniyan paapaa!
Physically, it does not change.	Ni ti ara, o wa ko yipada.
It is there to make a decision, one way or another.	O wa nibẹ ṣiṣe ipinnu, ọna kan tabi awọn miiran.
Everything you read here lives.	Ohun gbogbo ti o ka nibi o ngbe.
He alone is not.	Oun nikan ni ko ni.
There is still much to be done.	Pupọ ṣi wa lati ṣe.
You don’t want to anger one away.	O ko fẹ lati binu ọkan kuro.
We will have to leave this world.	A yoo ni lati lọ kuro ni ile aye yii.
Not the first, you know.	Kii ṣe akọkọ, o mọ.
You see a lot.	O ri ọpọlọpọ.
But hold on to that idea.	Ṣugbọn di ero yẹn mu.
Break whatever they need to.	Fọ ohunkohun ti wọn nilo lati.
This is so nice and easy.	Eleyi jẹ ki o dara ati ki o rọrun.
And the same thing happened with me.	Ati ohun kanna ṣẹlẹ pẹlu mi.
Remember to mention your name to the driver.	Ranti lati sọ orukọ rẹ fun awakọ naa.
There are not many such letters.	Nibẹ ni o wa ko ọpọlọpọ awọn iru awọn lẹta.
Look at me after class.	Wo mi lẹhin kilasi.
Most people have another human body.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni ara eniyan miiran.
You have only seen evil.	O ti ri ibi nikan.
We are looking for the best car.	A n wa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ to dara julọ.
No it's too late now.	Rara o ti pẹ ju bayi.
It takes only one life.	O gba aye kan nikan.
Never talk about it again.	Maṣe sọ nipa rẹ lẹẹkansi.
He doesn’t seem to have a large group of friends.	Ko dabi pe o ni ẹgbẹ nla ti awọn ọrẹ.
We cannot let this happen.	A ko le jẹ ki eyi ṣẹlẹ.
In the end, people can’t try to make this song.	Ni ipari, eniyan ko le gbiyanju lati ṣe orin yii.
He won her love and lost my heart.	O gba ifẹ rẹ o si padanu ọkan mi.
I forgot which one it was.	Mo gbagbe eyi ti o jẹ.
I want them to know.	Mo fe ki won mo.
We traveled for my husband’s work.	A rin irin-ajo fun iṣẹ ọkọ mi.
So they get a little more than everything.	Nitorina wọn gba diẹ diẹ sii ju ohun gbogbo lọ.
Just might too.	O kan le ju.
Children should not work that way.	Awọn ọmọde ko yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ ni ọna yẹn.
We would be happy to work with you.	Inu wa yoo dun lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
Didn't find anything good.	Ko ri ohun to dara.
I usually wear them.	Mo maa fi wọn wọ.
Think about it for a minute.	Ronu nipa rẹ fun iṣẹju kan.
I did not take his name.	Emi ko mu orukọ rẹ.
Maybe time will tell.	Boya akoko yoo sọ.
You can also do that.	O tun le ṣe iyẹn.
But it doesn’t matter to me.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe pataki fun mi.
She’s going home to the kids.	O n lọ si ile si awọn ọmọde.
You did well, by the way.	O ṣe daradara, nipasẹ ọna.
He just doesn’t understand.	O kan ko ni oye.
I had to build a new system.	Mo ni lati kọ eto tuntun kan.
But first, you have to repeat the test again.	Ṣugbọn akọkọ, o ni lati tun ṣe idanwo naa lẹẹkansi.
It is very important to contact a doctor.	O ṣe pataki pupọ lati kan si dokita kan.
Or you can have anything.	Tabi o le ni ohunkohun.
Look at all this metal!	Wo gbogbo irin yii!
Nothing good.	Ko si ohun ti o dara.
It is so great to have your home.	O jẹ nla pupọ lati ni ile rẹ.
We only have those who still have them now.	A nikan ni awọn ti o tun ni wọn bayi.
Everyone must understand it.	Gbogbo eniyan gbọdọ ni oye rẹ.
The new law should help, perhaps.	Ofin tuntun yẹ ki o ṣe iranlọwọ, boya.
No worries anymore.	Ko si aniyan mọ.
But that is not true.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
I just don’t want to skip that whole story.	Emi ko kan fẹ lati fo gbogbo itan yẹn.
He has not seen it because it is not possible.	Ko tii ri i nitori pe ko ṣee ṣe.
Depending on what works, and do not.	Da lori awọn ohun ti o ma ṣiṣẹ, ati ki o ma ko.
Not just with me.	Ko kan pẹlu mi.
She lives alone with a dog for the company.	O ngbe nikan pẹlu aja kan fun ile-iṣẹ.
No games are played here.	Ko si awọn ere ti a ṣe nibi.

Test, test, test.	Idanwo, idanwo, idanwo.
Some believe he killed himself.	Diẹ ninu awọn gbagbọ pe o pa ara rẹ.
I don’t know if that will do the job, but it can.	Emi ko mọ boya iyẹn yoo ṣe iṣẹ naa, ṣugbọn o le.
This is also love.	Eyi tun jẹ ifẹ.
Look down the street.	Wo isalẹ ita.

I found something in it.	Mo ri nkankan ninu re.
It brought my attention to a problem.	O mu akiyesi mi si iṣoro kan.
Here is your side.	Eyi ni ẹgbẹ rẹ.
Soon it became clear that the trains were running late.	Laipẹ o han gbangba pe awọn ọkọ oju irin ti n ṣiṣẹ pẹ.
Just make things easier.	O kan jẹ ki awọn nkan rọrun.
He thought his way around to the back.	O ro ọna rẹ ni ayika si ẹhin.
My father was there for education, especially.	Baba mi wa nibẹ fun ẹkọ, paapaa.
But it may be possible to change the situation to my advantage.	Ṣugbọn o le ṣee ṣe lati yi ipo naa si anfani mi.
And they will kill him.	Ati pe wọn yoo pa a.
That would be my advice.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ imọran mi.
Put your name on it all.	Fi orukọ rẹ si gbogbo rẹ.
What you want is not what you think you want.	Ohun ti o fẹ kii ṣe ohun ti o ro pe o fẹ.
However there are questions.	Sibẹsibẹ awọn ibeere wa.
You know how good they all are, down there.	O mọ bi gbogbo wọn ṣe dara to, isalẹ wa nibẹ.

He lives on a hill.	O ngbe lori oke kan.

Make sure the day works for you.	Rii daju pe ọjọ naa ṣiṣẹ fun ọ.
I need to sleep, but can't.	Mo nilo lati sun, ṣugbọn ko le.
But he was very young.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ọmọde pupọ.
This could not be more true.	Eyi ko le jẹ otitọ diẹ sii.
I have been married for two years.	Mo fun igbeyawo ni ọdun meji.
And his eyes.	Ati oju rẹ.
I still have to decide how to do it.	Mo tun ni lati pinnu bi o ṣe le ṣe.
He asked her.	O beere lọwọ rẹ.
We want to get that.	A fẹ lati gba iyẹn.
An old bus crashed into a nearby tree.	Ọkọ akero atijọ kan ya lu igi ti o wa nitosi.

We burned the shoes.	A sun awọn bata.
Not that there is much to begin with.	Kii ṣe pe pupọ wa lati bẹrẹ pẹlu.
It's just easy to be around.	O kan rọrun lati wa ni ayika.
There is no time for that right now.	Ko si akoko fun iyẹn ni bayi.

We walked from tree to tree looking up at them.	A rin lati igi de igi ti n wo wọn soke.
Just kill me now, he thought.	O kan pa mi ni bayi, o ro.

People don’t talk and act like that.	Eniyan ko sọrọ ati ṣe bii iyẹn.
A love letter.	A ife lẹta.
And let me tell you something.	Ati pe jẹ ki n sọ nkan kan fun ọ.

Hours and hours.	Awọn wakati ati awọn wakati akoko.

It’s not really that simple.	Ko ṣe ohun ti o rọrun gaan.
Everyone was happy when he lost.	Gbogbo eniyan dun nigbati o padanu.
Not so now.	Ko ri bẹ bayi.
However, it is important.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ṣe pataki.
Don't take life too seriously.	Maṣe gba aye ni pataki ju.
He saw her often.	O ri i nigbagbogbo.
The past few years have not been good.	Awọn ọdun diẹ ti o ti kọja ti ko dara.
May not even know.	Le ko paapaa mọ.
I mean you’ve seen it.	Mo tumọ si pe o ti rii.
They always get the job done.	Wọn nigbagbogbo gba iṣẹ naa.
That's the point.	Iyẹn ni ọrọ naa.
I said no.	Mo sọ rara.
You don't want to hear this.	O ko fẹ gbọ eyi.

Hold your hand and drink the water.	Di ọwọ rẹ ki o mu omi naa.
Clothes help keep people warm.	Awọn aṣọ ṣe iranlọwọ lati jẹ ki eniyan gbona.

He doesn’t want to have to beat you.	Ko fẹ lati ni lati lu ọ.
For others, it takes a lot more than that.	Fun awọn miiran, o gba pupọ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
Don’t think you can get away with it.	Maṣe ro pe o le lọ kuro pẹlu rẹ.
I want to know how to get that picture.	Mo fẹ lati mọ bi a ṣe le gba aworan yẹn.
But there is no time to talk about this.	Ṣugbọn ko si akoko lati sọrọ nipa eyi.
And these are my brothers.	Ati awọn wọnyi ni awọn arakunrin mi.
Read it carefully.	Ka rẹ daradara.
Which is, in the end.	Eyi ti o jẹ, ni ipari.
The application is simple.	Awọn ohun elo jẹ rọrun.
And they will tell you that when you arrive.	Ati pe wọn yoo sọ fun ọ pe nigbati o ba de.
To save our time.	Lati gba akoko wa.
He wrote many things.	O kọ ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
However, if your circumstances change you must notify our office.	Sibẹsibẹ, ti awọn ipo rẹ ba yipada o gbọdọ sọ fun ọfiisi wa.
Nothing much has really changed.	Ko si ohun ti Elo ti yi pada gan.
My sister is a doctor.	Arabinrin mi jẹ dokita.
The baby's body is in good shape.	Ara ọmọ naa dara daradara.
This went better than last season.	Eleyi lọ dara ju kẹhin akoko.
He continues to ask until they get something.	O tẹsiwaju lati beere titi ti wọn yoo fi gba nkankan.
So books are everything.	Nitorina awọn iwe jẹ ohun gbogbo.
There is no way he will stop now.	Ko si ọna ti oun yoo da duro ni bayi.
He has never seen anything like it before or since.	Ko ri ohunkohun bi o ṣaaju tabi lati igba yii.

Do not go to that beach.	Maṣe lọ si eti okun yẹn.
It will make a beautiful baby.	O yoo ṣe lẹwa ọmọ.

They just know what they want and how to get it.	Wọn kan mọ ohun ti wọn fẹ ati bi wọn ṣe le gba.

He died on me.	O ku lori mi.

You will go to school.	Iwọ yoo lọ si ile-iwe.
We will miss it but we will never forget it.	A yoo padanu rẹ ṣugbọn kii yoo gbagbe rẹ.
I'll let you go.	Emi yoo jẹ ki o lọ.
But they said no.	Ṣugbọn wọn sọ rara.
Just give it time.	O kan fun ni akoko.
Cats leave gifts in our garden.	Awọn ologbo fi awọn ẹbun silẹ ninu ọgba wa.

It was a long night.	O jẹ alẹ pipẹ.
I have no idea you will find it that way.	Emi ko ni imọran pe iwọ yoo rii ni ọna yẹn.
Nothing you say, would be wrong.	Ko si ohun ti o sọ, yoo jẹ aṣiṣe.
He said he was there all the way.	O sọ pe o wa ni gbogbo ọna.

You should not go out at this time of night.	O yẹ ki o ko jade ni akoko alẹ yi.

I looked behind me.	Mo wo lẹhin mi.
You know how to tell a story you want to hear.	O mọ bi o ṣe le sọ itan kan ti o fẹ gbọ.
The boy's wife seemed angry.	Iyawo ọmọkunrin naa dabi ẹni pe o binu.

I have never felt it for any of them.	Emi ko tii rilara rẹ rara fun eyikeyi ninu wọn.
As of yet, it's not.	Bi ti sibẹsibẹ, o ni ko.
You need to reload it.	O nilo lati tun gbe e jade lẹẹkansi.
Applications are not legal advice.	Awọn ohun elo kii ṣe imọran ofin.
Please see it.	Jọwọ wo o.
When doing love, do love.	Nigbati o ba n ṣe ifẹ, ṣe ifẹ.
We have an office.	A ni ọfiisi.
He was clearly unfit for the job.	O han gbangba pe ko yẹ fun iṣẹ naa.
I hope not.	Mo nireti pe kii ṣe.
It makes it sound special, but it’s not.	O mu ki o dun pataki, ṣugbọn kii ṣe.
I wish that would happen soon.	Mo fẹ pe iyẹn yoo ṣẹlẹ laipẹ.
Neither his wife, nor his father.	Bẹni iyawo rẹ, tabi baba rẹ.
She had been with a boy at a beach party.	O ti wa pẹlu ọmọkunrin kan ni ibi ayẹyẹ eti okun kan.
Or we will go too.	Tabi a yoo lọ paapaa.
It was pretty beyond words.	O je lẹwa kọja ọrọ.
We were a man downstairs.	A wà ọkunrin kan isalẹ.
Is only going to get better.	Ti wa ni nikan lilọ si gba dara.
Without water, life is impossible on this earth.	Laisi omi, igbesi aye ko ṣee ṣe lori ile aye yii.
However, they don’t make big games when they need to.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn ko ṣe awọn ere nla nigbati wọn nilo lati.
I wish that was true.	Mo fẹ pe iyẹn jẹ otitọ.
He tells us, however, that we need to get our story out.	O sọ fun wa, sibẹsibẹ, pe a nilo lati gba itan wa jade.
Don't call me.	Maṣe pe mi.
This is the first time this has happened.	Eyi ni igba akọkọ ti o ti ṣẹlẹ.
Is not what they asked for.	Ṣe kii ṣe ohun ti wọn beere fun.
The feeling of his hand on her.	Awọn rilara ti ọwọ rẹ lori rẹ.
Without me, nothing happens below.	Laisi mi, ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni isalẹ.
I left the office and went home.	Mo kuro ni ọfiisi mo si lọ si ile.
You can call it hitting you.	O le pe o lu ọ.
For a few minutes he thought it would change.	Fun iṣẹju diẹ o ro pe yoo yipada.
This story is so, impossible to change.	Itan yii jẹ bẹ, ko ṣee ṣe lati yipada.
They did not do their job but they will do it from tonight.	Wọn ko ṣe iṣẹ wọn ṣugbọn wọn yoo ṣe lati alẹ yii lọ.
There is no explanation for that.	Ko ni alaye fun iyẹn.
I did not teach any of that in school.	Emi ko kọ eyikeyi ninu iyẹn ni ile-iwe.
They are not who and what they are.	Wọn kii ṣe tani ati kini o jẹ.
It was great.	O je nla.
It may be one of the best ever created.	O le jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ti o dara ju lailai da.
Everything this guy said was for a reason.	Ohun gbogbo ti eniyan yii sọ jẹ fun idi kan.
So he does not know what it looks like.	Nitorina ko mọ bi o ṣe dabi.
The sun is less than an hour to wear.	Oorun ko ju wakati kan lọ lati wọ.
And there is no valid reason here.	Ati pe ko si idi ti o yẹ nibi.
All you can see is the activities.	Gbogbo ohun ti o le rii ni awọn iṣẹ ṣiṣe.
It is an opportunity not given to everyone.	O jẹ anfani ti a ko fun gbogbo eniyan.
So we stopped.	Nitorina a duro ni.
They are important.	Wọn ṣe pataki.
But for now, this time.	Ṣugbọn fun bayi, ni akoko yii.
It doesn’t let it be in my head.	Ko jẹ ki o wa ni ori mi.
People will not wait for you.	Awọn eniyan kii yoo duro fun rẹ.
It is important to know why.	O ṣe pataki lati mọ idi ti.
See you in the game !.	Wo e ninu ere!.
He came home.	O wa si ile.
So did everyone else.	Bẹẹ ni gbogbo eniyan miiran ṣe.
I almost left.	Mo ti fẹrẹ fi silẹ.
Look at your feet.	Wo ẹsẹ rẹ.
My favorite place is near the beach.	Ibi ayanfẹ mi wa nitosi eti okun.
I have gone, like, three times now.	Mo ti lọ, bii, ni igba mẹta ni bayi.
People eat a lot and take their time.	Awọn eniyan jẹun pupọ ati gba akoko wọn.
His words are completely incomprehensible.	Awọn ọrọ rẹ ko ni oye patapata.
But it was only for two days.	Sugbon o jẹ nikan fun ọjọ meji.
Make sure it is OK.	Rii daju pe o dara.
I'll give you something.	Emi yoo fi nkan si ọ.
Both are completely wrong.	Awọn mejeeji jẹ aṣiṣe patapata.
My uncle arrived a week before the wedding.	Arakunrin baba mi de ọsẹ kan ṣaaju igbeyawo.
So it has to be true.	Nitorina o gbọdọ jẹ otitọ.
That's nice to hear.	Iyẹn dara lati gbọ.
We were a too small group.	A wà kan ju kekere ẹgbẹ.
They have life.	Won ni aye.
Past stories.	Awọn itan ti o ti kọja.
However, they were used after a while.	Sibẹsibẹ, a lo wọn lẹhin igba diẹ.
But when he tried to walk, he could not.	Ṣugbọn nigbati o gbiyanju lati rin, ko le.
All you have to do is look at their faces.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ni lati ṣe ni wo oju wọn.
He asked me.	O beere fun mi.
I hit really hard with it.	Mo lu gan lile pẹlu rẹ.
You let a few minutes pass.	O jẹ ki awọn iṣẹju diẹ kọja.
You remember how to love yourself.	O ranti bi o ṣe le nifẹ ara rẹ.
It's not coming.	Ko n bọ.
Some of them are working.	Diẹ ninu wọn n ṣiṣẹ.
She loves it completely.	O nifẹ rẹ patapata.
Bring a picture into your watch.	Mu aworan wa sinu aago rẹ.
I mean obviously.	Mo tumọ si gbangba.
I’m not sure how you feel about this.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bi o ṣe lero nipa eyi.
All my bread is art.	Gbogbo akara mi jẹ iṣẹ ọna.
But that is not easy to do.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko rọrun lati ṣe.
In fact, people are talking about something else.	Ni otitọ, awọn eniyan n sọrọ nipa nkan miiran.
He did not let anyone touch them.	Oun ko jẹ ki ẹnikẹni fi ọwọ kan wọn.
But not for much longer.	Sugbon ko fun Elo to gun.
He lives on the roads now.	O ngbe ni awọn opopona bayi.
You think you need your advice.	O ro pe o nilo imọran rẹ.
Few people enter this room.	Diẹ eniyan ni o wọ yara yii.
I just get them in the decision.	Mo kan gba wọn ni ipinnu.
They continue to come.	Wọn tẹsiwaju lati wa.
No new people came into the house.	Ko si iru eniyan tuntun ti o wa sinu ile.
What is wrong?	Kini ti ko tọ?
Lots of annoying things have been written about this.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan ti o binu ni a ti kọ nipa eyi.
Others are trying to understand, to know their points.	Awọn miiran n gbiyanju lati ni oye, lati mọ awọn aaye wọn.
I already know what it is.	Mo ti mọ ohun ti o jẹ.
What can we expect.	Kini a le reti.
Make sure there is the right key.	Daju pe bọtini to tọ wa.
Together, we decided.	Papọ, a pinnu.
The past.	Ohun ti o ti kọja.
Why do you want to do this?	Kini idi ti o fẹ ṣe eyi?
He thought a little bit about why that was happening.	O ronu diẹ si idi ti iyẹn fi n ṣẹlẹ.
That is not out of the question.	Iyẹn ko jade ninu ibeere naa.
We can live in love.	A le gbe ni ife.
There is no reason to.	Ko si idi kankan lati.
Some of that already exists.	Diẹ ninu iyẹn ti wa tẹlẹ.
They take good care of it.	Wọn tọju rẹ daradara.
Allow to sit overnight.	Gba laaye lati joko ni alẹ.
Whatever makes you think that.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ ki o ronu iyẹn.
They will tell you what we can not do, and why.	Wọn yoo sọ fun ọ ohun ti a ko le ṣe, ati idi ti.
We also love each other.	A tun nifẹ ara wa.
Maybe even before he would have called you.	Boya paapaa ṣaaju ki oun yoo ti pe e.
And it was this great deal.	Ati pe o jẹ adehun nla yii.
They do not, of course, not in any special way.	Wọn ko ṣe rara, dajudaju, kii ṣe ni eyikeyi ọna pataki.
What matters is how you react when it happens.	Ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni bi o ṣe ṣe nigbati o ṣẹlẹ.
That will make things better.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ ki awọn nkan dara.
Everyone is looking for energy.	Gbogbo eniyan n wa agbara.
You do what you want anyway.	O ṣe ohun ti o fẹ eyikeyi ọna.
You can have a great life here.	O le ni igbesi aye nla nibi ti o wa.
He is the best we have seen in a long time.	Oun ni o dara julọ ti a ti rii ni igba pipẹ.
We cannot see the future.	A ko le ri si ojo iwaju.
These skills are essential for building a restaurant.	Awọn ọgbọn wọnyi jẹ pataki fun ṣiṣe ile ounjẹ kan.
We have been here for a while now.	A ti wa fun igba diẹ bayi.
He certainly did not think of anything as serious as this.	O dajudaju ko ronu ohunkohun ti o ṣe pataki bi eyi.
You do not, either.	Iwọ ko, boya.
Not everyone will love it, period.	Kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan yoo nifẹ rẹ, akoko.
It was raining outside, and he could not go home.	Ojo ti n ro ni ita, ko si le lọ si ile.
I ask people why they believe.	Mo beere awọn eniyan idi ti wọn gbagbọ.
Tomorrow will be a good time to start.	Ọla yoo jẹ akoko ti o dara lati bẹrẹ.
There is good money to be made there.	Owo ti o dara wa lati ṣe nibẹ.
Here, they learn about education.	Nibi, wọn kọ ẹkọ nipa ẹkọ ẹkọ.
The teacher asked a question.	Olukọ naa beere ibeere kan.
Maybe we will walk, come back and go another one.	Boya a yoo rin, pada wa ki a lọ miiran.
Try and take the following.	Gbiyanju ki o si ya awọn wọnyi.
That is what my friend told me.	Ohun ti ọrẹ mi sọ fun mi niyẹn.
Her dress did not look like her mother's.	Aṣọ rẹ ko dabi ti iya rẹ.
He did this for several weeks.	O ṣe eyi fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọsẹ.
I don’t want to do this already.	Emi ko fẹ ṣe eyi tẹlẹ.
I have had great work from them.	Mo ti ni iṣẹ nla lati ọdọ wọn.
Decide on anything that seems best to you.	Ṣe ipinnu lori ohunkohun ti o dabi pe o dara julọ fun ọ.
Much to do here.	Pupọ lati ṣe nibi.
I raised my bar.	Mo gbe igi mi soke.

I'm trying not to, but it's just hard when you see it.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ko, sugbon o ni o kan lile nigba ti o ba ri ti o.
Not a thing.	Kii ṣe ohun kan.
It works, it works, and it works more.	O ṣiṣẹ, ṣiṣẹ, o si ṣiṣẹ diẹ sii.
You just can't do it.	O kan ko le ṣe.
However, you may be better off with these three than yourself.	Sibẹsibẹ, o le dara julọ pẹlu awọn mẹta wọnyi ju funrararẹ lọ.
Only not today.	Nikan ko loni.
Before the test.	Ṣaaju idanwo.
I am your wife and you are my husband.	Emi ni iyawo rẹ ati pe iwọ ni ọkọ mi.
Do not leave me alone.	Maṣe fun mi silẹ.
You do not have to keep.	O ko ni lati tọju.

Give him plenty of room to live.	Fun u ni yara pupọ lati gbe.
You can't worry about it right now.	O ko le ṣe aniyan nipa rẹ ni bayi.

It doesn't work either.	Ko ṣiṣẹ boya.
Neither here nor there, no thoughts or situations.	Bẹni nibi tabi nibẹ, ko si ero tabi awọn ipo.
Do not do that.	Maṣe ṣe iyẹn.
You can not sleep.	O ko le sun.
I will know in a day or so.	Emi yoo mọ ni ọjọ kan tabi bẹ.
And I have a job.	Ati pe Mo ni iṣẹ kan.
They learn how the plane works.	Wọn kọ bi ọkọ ofurufu naa ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
More lessons have not been done.	Awọn ẹkọ diẹ sii ko tii ṣe.
That is your decision.	Iyẹn ni ipinnu rẹ.

Several methods will be used.	Awọn ọna pupọ yoo ṣee lo.

Obviously, it does not work.	O han ni, ko ṣiṣẹ.
You know that.	O mọ iyẹn.

As such it has become a widely used tool.	Bi iru bẹẹ o ti di ohun elo ti a lo pupọ.
He and his brother received only minor injuries.	Oun ati arakunrin rẹ gba awọn ipalara kekere nikan.

There is so much to do.	Ọpọlọpọ wa lati ṣe.
When we grow up, we will live a life that is worth living.	Nigbati a ba dagba, a yoo ṣe igbesi aye ti o nifẹ si.
Let's just say we don't do it.	Jẹ ká kan sọ a ko ṣe awọn ti o.
Because it makes me feel very welcome.	Nitori ti o mu ki mi lero gidigidi gba.
So you are here.	Nitorina o wa nibi.
It is growing stronger.	O n dagba ni okun sii.
His mother is right.	Iya rẹ jẹ otitọ.
It is felt by everyone.	O jẹ rilara nipasẹ gbogbo eniyan.

Not to be outdone.	Ko lati ga.

He did not speak for a long time.	Ko sọrọ fun igba pipẹ.
I know other information must be included.	Mo mọ pe alaye miiran gbọdọ wa pẹlu.

A small boat moved to the beach.	Ọkọ kekere kan gbe si eti okun.

This perhaps should not have come as a surprise.	Eyi boya ko yẹ ki o ti wa bi iyalẹnu.
Solar energy dominates many buildings.	Agbara oorun ṣe agbara ọpọlọpọ awọn ile.

I do not understand why we are trying to keep it open.	Emi ko loye idi ti a n gbiyanju lati jẹ ki o ṣii.
This makes me think.	Eyi jẹ ki n ronu.
The book is a gift.	Iwe naa jẹ ẹbun.
Don’t force it to be what you want it to be.	Maṣe fi agbara mu u lati jẹ ohun ti o fẹ.
This is especially true with company names.	Eyi jẹ otitọ paapaa pẹlu awọn orukọ ile-iṣẹ.
This will hurt in some situations.	Eyi yoo ṣe ipalara ni awọn ipo kan.
I stayed at your house a lot this year.	Mo duro si ile rẹ pupọ ni ọdun yii.
Now, let’s sleep a little.	Bayi, jẹ ki a sun diẹ.
We need you to hit fast.	A nilo ti o lu sare.
Someone may also be included.	Ẹnikan tun le wa ninu.
Only nothing is the same.	Nikan ko si ohun ti o jẹ kanna.
Something full in the bag.	Nkankan ti o kun ninu apo.
More time with him.	Diẹ akoko pẹlu rẹ.
They have something we don’t have.	Won ni nkan ti a ko ni.
Money, often, changes hands.	Owo, nigbagbogbo, yipada ọwọ.

Let’s continue with the journey.	Jẹ ki a tẹsiwaju pẹlu irin-ajo naa.
You are not the one.	Iwọ kii ṣe ọkan naa.

Continue to decide the parents.	Tẹsiwaju lati pinnu awọn obi.

The boy was angry.	Ọmọkunrin naa binu.
Would be surprised if you agree.	Yoo jẹ iyalẹnu ti o ba gba.
We are meeting with them tonight.	A n pade pẹlu wọn ni alẹ oni.
Everything is like in the world of men, but more beautiful.	Ohun gbogbo ti o wa bi ninu aye ti awọn ọkunrin, ṣugbọn diẹ lẹwa.
I want you to see this.	Mo fe ki e wo eleyi.
It took him a while to talk to me again.	O gba akoko diẹ fun u lati ba mi sọrọ lẹẹkansi.
Please see when you have life.	Jọwọ wo nigbati o ba ni aye.
I do not live now.	Emi ko ngbe bayi.
Obviously this cannot be so.	O han gbangba pe eyi ko le ri bẹ.
I've only ever heard of them.	Mo ti sọ nikan lailai gbọ ti wọn.
And that’s the right thing to do.	Ati pe ohun ti o tọ lati ṣe ni.
Others stand out because they are not, like you.	Awọn miiran duro jade nitori wọn kii ṣe, bii rẹ.
By the way, he does not understand.	Nipa ọna, ko ṣe oye.
I think he did.	Mo ro pe o tun ṣe.
We are at that point again.	A tun wa ni aaye yẹn lẹẹkansi.
He called me up, and we went out to lunch.	O pe mi soke, a si jade lọ si ounjẹ ọsan.
He is here now.	O wa nibi bayi.
They are very helpful and very helpful.	Wọn wa pupọ ati iranlọwọ pupọ.
Everyone around you changed.	Gbogbo eniyan ni ayika rẹ yipada.
But that did not happen.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ.
Not for now, at least.	Kii ṣe fun bayi, o kere ju.
You need to make a go of things.	O nilo lati ṣe kan lọ ti ohun.
Doctors say he is dying.	Awọn dokita sọ pe o n ku.
Just know where to start.	Kan mọ ibiti o bẹrẹ.
At first, he was afraid to go out alone.	Ni akọkọ, o bẹru lati jade lọ nikan.
At least they were trying for something.	O kere ju wọn n gbiyanju fun nkankan.
In fact it caused a lot of problems at the time.	Ni otitọ o fa ọpọlọpọ awọn iṣoro ni akoko naa.
The environment is important.	Ayika aye ṣe pataki.
You have no game yet.	O ko ni ere kankan sibẹsibẹ.
We do, we try.	A ṣe, a gbiyanju.
This is too important.	Eyi ṣe pataki ju.
We will never know exactly what happened now.	A kii yoo mọ otitọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni bayi.
Written contract.	Iwe adehun ti a kọ.
And that cannot happen.	Ati pe iyẹn ko le ṣẹlẹ.
I want one day, I want two.	Mo fe ojo kan, o fe meji.
Thus, he was confident that he could receive the gift.	Bayi, o ni idaniloju pe oun le gba ẹbun naa.
No, just not at all.	Rara, o kan rara.
Great game for us.	Ere nla fun wa.
A drink of water.	Ohun mimu ti omi.
But read the book.	Ṣugbọn ka iwe naa.
We have so many things we will never need.	A ni ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan ti a ko ni nilo lailai.
Cannot put it off anymore.	Ko le fi si pa mọ.
I hope it is.	Mo nireti pe o jẹ.
The new house will look great.	Ile tuntun naa yoo dara julọ.
Perhaps the sweetest thing they did.	Boya ohun ti o dun julọ ti wọn ṣe.
And it will raise some questions of its own.	Ati pe yoo gbe diẹ ninu awọn ibeere ti ara rẹ.
I want to be able to live everywhere.	Mo fẹ lati ni anfani lati gbe nibi gbogbo.
It can grow to a height.	O le dagba si giga.
But that question was never asked.	Ṣugbọn a ko beere ibeere yẹn rara.
They are not worth the money.	Wọn ko tọ si owo naa.
But he was too angry to notice.	Ṣugbọn o ti binu pupọ lati ṣe akiyesi.
If it can't help, find other things to do.	Ti ko ba le ṣe iranlọwọ, wa awọn nkan miiran lati ṣe.
But something here can not go away yet.	Ṣugbọn ohun kan wa nibi ko le lọ kuro sibẹsibẹ.
I would love to be that person one day.	Emi yoo fẹ lati jẹ eniyan yẹn ni ọjọ kan.
We will stay on.	A yoo duro lori.
You have to go.	O ni lati lọ.
You can let it be.	O le jẹ ki o le.
But there is also a good sense.	Ṣugbọn ori ti o dara tun wa.
Her face was beautiful.	Oju rẹ si lẹwa.
He said the roads are great for walking.	O sọ pe awọn opopona jẹ nla fun rin.
He did not go.	Oun ko lọ.
I don’t know about all that.	Emi ko mọ nipa gbogbo iyẹn.
It is under water.	O wa labẹ omi.
I look like a.	Mo dabi a.
He turned his head.	O si yi ori rẹ.
It’s in them, they take time.	O wa ninu wọn, wọn gba akoko.
I should have given you everything.	Mo yẹ ki o ti fun ọ ni ohun gbogbo.
We start a test here.	A bẹrẹ idanwo kan nibi.
And to worry.	Ati lati ṣe aniyan.
The coming hours will be crucial.	Awọn wakati ti n bọ yoo jẹ pataki.
We are happy.	Inu wa dun.
The man ran past me behind the woman.	Ọkunrin naa sare kọja mi lẹhin obinrin naa.
That is why we were there in the first place.	Ti o ni idi ti a wa nibẹ ni akọkọ ibi.
I think you get the point.	Mo ro pe o gba aaye naa.
Are you worried that you will lose your train?	Ṣe o ni aniyan pe iwọ yoo padanu ọkọ oju irin rẹ?
By people like them.	Nipa eniyan bi wọn.
We are just watching it from here.	A kan n wo u lati ibi yii lọ.
Tea has been served from morning till night here.	Tii ti jẹ lati owurọ titi di alẹ nibi.
It does not matter.	Ko ṣe pataki.
After reading my piece, he asked for my opinion.	Lẹhin ti o ka nkan mi, o beere fun ero mi.
I wonder if it is included.	Mo ro boya o wa ninu.
Education has not changed.	Ẹkọ ko yipada.
What brought us here?	Kini o mu wa si ibi?
If you do, it does not show.	Ti o ba ṣe, ko fi han.
I am glad to see so many of you here today.	Inu mi dun lati ri ọpọlọpọ awọn ti o nibi loni.
That will be my job.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ iṣẹ mi.
And it also makes me feel again.	Ati pe o tun jẹ ki mi lero lẹẹkansi.
We will not reach you, but we continue to try.	A kii yoo de ọdọ rẹ, ṣugbọn a tẹsiwaju lati gbiyanju.
He will try anything to start his vacation.	Oun yoo gbiyanju ohunkohun lati bẹrẹ isinmi rẹ.
How nice you are tonight.	Bawo ni o ṣe dara ni alẹ oni.
I just want to know where you are from.	Mo kan fẹ lati mọ ibiti o ti wa.
It should be very good this year.	O yẹ ki o dara pupọ ni ọdun yii.
The harms are many.	Awọn ipalara jẹ pupọ.
If not, more people will do.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, diẹ sii eniyan yoo ṣe.
I so agree.	Mo bẹ gba.
Will think of something.	Yoo ro ti nkankan.
They take some time to grow on people.	Wọn gba akoko diẹ lati dagba lori eniyan.
Nice to see that.	O dara lati rii iyẹn.
I want to do this the way you do.	Mo fẹ lati ṣe eyi bi o ṣe ṣe.
It’s pretty much at the top of your path.	O dara julọ ni oke ọna rẹ.
But they knew they had to walk.	Ṣugbọn wọn mọ pe wọn ni lati rin.
Two key requirements in any car.	Awọn ibeere bọtini meji ni eyikeyi ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
Close your eyes, hoping for the best.	Pa oju rẹ, nireti ohun ti o dara julọ.
Everything works fine.	Ohun gbogbo n ṣiṣẹ daradara.
They are sure.	Wọn daju ni.
We have a game plan.	A ni eto ere kan.
Very few of them last for a long time.	Pupọ diẹ ninu wọn duro fun igba pipẹ.
A minute passed without any of them talking.	Iṣẹju kan kọja laisi eyikeyi ninu wọn sọrọ.
I'm sure.	O da mi loju.
Or, you can drink for the whole year.	Tabi, o le mu fun gbogbo odun.
He changed his words to his heart.	O yi ọrọ tirẹ pada si ọkan rẹ.
However there are also problems.	Sibẹsibẹ awọn iṣoro tun wa.
They stand in a way.	Wọn duro ni ọna kan.
But you don’t see much anymore.	Ṣugbọn o ko rii pupọ mọ.
Some of them even do.	Diẹ ninu wọn paapaa ṣe.
Below you hope not.	Ni isalẹ o nireti ko.
I do not remember that day.	Emi ko ranti ọjọ naa.
And that makes it worth something.	Ati awọn ti o mu ki o tọ nkankan.
He has been writing ever since.	O ti n kọ lati igba naa.
They are the same.	Wọn jẹ kanna.
He is my first love.	Oun ni ifẹ mi akọkọ.
I can understand that power.	Mo le ni oye agbara naa.
And this is not just about money.	Ati pe eyi kii ṣe nipa owo nikan.
They kill people.	Wọn pa eniyan.
I haven’t had my lap legs yet.	Ko ti ni awọn ẹsẹ okun mi sibẹsibẹ.
As we see so much in this way !.	Bi a ṣe rii pupọ julọ ni ọna yii!.
Return to your desk.	Pada si tabili rẹ.
They know where we are.	Wọn mọ ibi ti a wa.
I think it was a miracle.	Mo ro pe o jẹ iṣẹ iyanu kan.
Now they are stuck.	Bayi wọn ti di.
We want to get people to do what we want.	A fẹ lati gba eniyan lati ṣe ohun ti a fẹ.
You think it will be so.	O ro pe yoo jẹ bẹ.
They just love going to work.	Wọn kan nifẹ lilọ si iṣẹ.
This method will become very handy.	Ọna yii yoo di ọwọ pupọ.
The gift was not well received.	Ẹbun naa ko gba daradara.
It's a small house.	Ile kekere kan ni.
Or anything from before.	Tabi ohunkohun lati ṣaaju.
Have you heard the news?	Njẹ o ti gbọ iroyin naa?
Today, everyone does everything.	Loni, gbogbo eniyan ṣe ohun gbogbo.
It is not.	O jẹ ko.
They know we are not here for the easy time.	Wọn mọ pe a ko wa fun akoko ti o rọrun.
It will not be the same in some days.	Kii yoo jẹ kanna ni awọn ọjọ kan.
You never know what kind of deal you will get.	Iwọ ko mọ iru adehun ti iwọ yoo gba.
Even with these systems, it is difficult to find something.	Paapaa pẹlu awọn ọna ṣiṣe wọnyi, o nira lati wa nkan.
I know it's very good.	Mo mọ pe o dara pupọ.
How you let your head be this bad.	Bawo ni o ṣe jẹ ki ori rẹ jẹ buburu yii.
Not around me.	Ko ni ayika mi.
Well, you are not alone.	O dara, kii ṣe iwọ nikan.
But a word appears.	Ṣugbọn ọrọ kan han.
Remember that space itself is a driving force.	Ranti pe aaye funrararẹ jẹ agbara awakọ.
Power comes from our sea.	Agbara wa lati okun wa.
This is personal.	Eyi jẹ ti ara ẹni.
You have to get out and work.	O ni lati jade ki o ṣiṣẹ.
This amount can be paid in a few minutes.	Iye yii le san ni iṣẹju diẹ.
I think you will find it amazing.	Mo ro pe iwọ yoo rii pe o jẹ iyanu.

I try to enjoy everything that happens to me.	Mo gbiyanju lati gbadun ohun gbogbo ti o ṣẹlẹ si mi.
Some of us see that.	Diẹ ninu wa rii iyẹn.
Let them do it another day.	Jẹ ki wọn ṣe ni ọjọ miiran.
He did not see me.	Ko ri mi.
You have not been here before.	O ko ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
We must all be able to say what we feel.	Gbogbo wa gbọdọ ni anfani lati sọ ohun ti a lero.
It is not me I am thinking about.	Kii ṣe emi ni o n ronu nipa.
You can sleep on.	O le sun lori.
We cannot do without your help.	A ko le ṣe laisi iranlọwọ rẹ.
Okay, you can’t have them or him.	O dara, o ko le ni wọn tabi oun.
They let us do it again.	Wọn jẹ ki a tun ṣe fun u.
That is not very easy to find.	Iyẹn ko rọrun pupọ lati wa.

Just as well to start early.	O kan bi daradara lati bẹrẹ ni kutukutu.
Not so much.	Kii ṣe bii iyẹn diẹ.
To let us feel with.	Lati jẹ ki a lero pẹlu.
No one has been there.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ti wa nibẹ.
That is how life becomes our teacher.	Iyẹn ni igbesi aye ṣe di olukọ wa.
He began to walk.	O bẹrẹ lati rin.
Do the hard and important work.	Ṣe iṣẹ ti o nira ati pataki.
It is up to us to decide.	O wa si wa lati pinnu.
He thought he was on top of this.	O ro pe o wa lori oke yii.

Brother or father.	Arakunrin tabi baba.
First one of the members will present a book.	Akọkọ ọkan ninu awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ yoo fi iwe kan han.
That includes body and head.	Iyẹn pẹlu ara ati ori.
None of my words make sense.	Ko si ọrọ mi ti o ni oye.
Should know.	Yẹ ki o mọ.
But he was afraid.	Ṣugbọn o bẹru.
They will not charge until it is dropped.	Wọn kii yoo gba owo titi ti a fi gbe silẹ.
Need to leave.	Nilo lati lọ kuro.
This is a big mistake.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe nla kan.
Sit there in the water.	Joko nibẹ ninu omi.
I have to put it in a box.	Mo ni lati fi i sinu apoti.
But that is also in my future.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn tun wa ni ọjọ iwaju mi.
I could be completely wrong here.	Mo le jẹ aṣiṣe patapata nibi.
You have done it.	O ti ṣe e.

That hurts a lot.	Iyẹn ṣe ipalara pupọ.
You did really well.	O ṣe gan daradara.
Stay with the program.	Duro pẹlu eto naa.

And you have done well.	Ati pe o ti ṣe daradara.
It works on anything.	O ṣiṣẹ lori ohunkohun.
Their parents are worried, as are their friends.	Awọn obi wọn ṣe aniyan, bii awọn ọrẹ wọn.

It seemed that all the students knew each other.	O dabi enipe gbogbo awọn ọmọ ile-iwe mọ ara wọn.
It would be nice to forget the whole thing.	Yoo dara julọ lati gbagbe gbogbo nkan naa.
One report says at least three people have died.	Iroyin kan sọ pe o kere ju eniyan mẹta ti ku.
These foods are high in fiber.	Awọn ounjẹ wọnyi ga ni okun.
Home team.	Ẹgbẹ ile.

He pulls one fast.	O fa ọkan ti o yara.
We can never do it.	A ko le ṣe lailai.

Something they will remember without question.	Nkankan ti wọn yoo ranti laisi ibeere.
I missed a lot of time.	Mo padanu akoko pupọ.
The work is.	Iṣẹ naa jẹ.
They have done this many times before.	Wọn ti ṣe eyi ni ọpọlọpọ igba tẹlẹ.
He wrote a little book on his meeting.	O kọ iwe kekere kan lori ipade rẹ.
By and by we will get a foot for him.	Nipa ati nipasẹ a yoo gba ẹsẹ kan fun u.
I can send them to another world.	Mo ti le fi wọn si miiran aye.
No friends passed.	Ko si awọn ọrẹ ti o kọja.
But before we can do anything else, we must have something to eat.	Ṣugbọn ki a to ṣe ohunkohun miiran, a gbọdọ ni nkan lati jẹ.

That does not exist yet.	Iyẹn ko tii wa tẹlẹ.

It is on the same road as your cottage.	O wa ni opopona kanna bi ile kekere rẹ.
Of course something must be there.	Dajudaju ohun kan gbọdọ wa nibẹ.
So, should you just stay in this room?	Nitorina, o yẹ ki o kan duro ni yara yii?
Thus, they have learned new ways.	Bayi, wọn ti kọ awọn ọna tuntun.

They are all behind the money, and after that, people.	Gbogbo wọn wa lẹhin owo, ati lẹhin eyi, awọn eniyan.

You can't make a decision because you are afraid.	O ko le ṣe ipinnu nitori pe o bẹru.

The boy dropped the girl at his home, and drove home.	Ọmọkunrin naa sọ ọmọbirin naa silẹ ni ile rẹ, o si wakọ si ile.

From these they are able to wear each other.	Lati inu wọnyi wọn ni anfani lati wọ ara wọn.
I think this is correct.	Mo ro pe eyi tọ.

There is no one in the world like him.	Ko si enikeni ninu aye bi re.
It is permanent because people expect it to happen.	O wa titi nitori eniyan nireti pe yoo ṣẹlẹ.
The book does not say how they died.	Iwe naa ko sọ bi wọn ṣe ku.
She was beautiful and she was afraid of both.	O lẹwa ati pe o bẹru awọn mejeeji.

He looked up, he looked at his face.	O wo oke, o wo oju rẹ.
So many, there are many questions.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ, awọn ibeere pupọ wa.
Even my father did not believe it would happen.	Paapaa baba mi ko gbagbọ pe yoo ṣẹlẹ.
It's like you.	O dabi iwọ.
No money required.	Ko si owo ti a beere.
They may not have the necessary skills.	Wọn le ma ni awọn ọgbọn pataki.

His eyes did not hesitate.	Oju rẹ ko ṣiyemeji.

I know this is not what you want to hear.	Mo mọ pe eyi kii ṣe ohun ti o fẹ gbọ.
I mean a lot.	Mo tumọ si pupọ.
You just need to understand.	O nilo nikan lati ni oye.
Just keep going until you finish it.	Kan tẹsiwaju titi iwọ o fi pari rẹ.
Just know that it gives more than everyone else.	O kan mọ pe o fun diẹ sii ju gbogbo eniyan miiran lọ.
I wash my hands of all money.	Mo wẹ ọwọ mi ti gbogbo owo.

Make sure it is warm.	Rii daju pe o gbona.
There is plenty of water, and something to eat.	Omi pupọ wa, ati nkan lati jẹ.
Life in these mountains.	Igbesi aye ni awọn oke nla wọnyi.
It makes it seem like nothing happened here.	O jẹ ki o dabi pe ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nibi.
It does not have the appropriate financial interest in this book.	Ko ni anfani owo ti o yẹ ninu iwe yii.
Take off the man's clothes.	Bọ aṣọ ọkunrin naa kuro.
They are not into it.	Wọn ko sinu rẹ.

You have the key.	O ni bọtini.

After a while he asked.	Lẹhin igba diẹ o beere.
Well, it could be.	O dara, o le jẹ.
It becomes important to explain that.	O di pataki lati ṣe alaye naa.
You are what it is.	Iwọ ni ohun ti o jẹ.
The rain has come.	Igba ojo ti de.
I will teach you tomorrow.	Emi yoo kọ ọ ni ọla.
But the woman did not think so.	Ṣugbọn obinrin naa ko ronu eyi.
No minimum wage required.	Ko si iye owo ti o kere ju ti a beere fun.

We leave tomorrow.	A fi ọla.
This is where your story ends.	Eyi ni ibi ti itan rẹ pari.
Just want to say continue !.	O kan fẹ lati sọ tẹsiwaju!.
But, well.	Ṣugbọn, daradara.
I laid my hands on the table.	Mo ti gbe ọwọ mi lori tabili.
That could really change the game.	Iyẹn le yi ere naa pada gaan.
This is where we live.	Eyi ni ibi ti a gbe.
The houses outside are all wood.	Awọn ile ti o wa ni ita ita gbogbo jẹ igi.
She knew she could talk to me or her mother about anything.	O mọ pe o le sọrọ si mi tabi iya rẹ nipa ohunkohun.
You have a good life in front of you.	O ni aye ti o dara ni iwaju rẹ.

He let go.	O jẹ ki lọ.
I did not think of anything else.	Emi ko ro ti ohunkohun miiran.
The boy outside won.	Ọmọkunrin ti o wa ni ita gba.

This dress is nice to touch.	Aṣọ yii dara lati fi ọwọ kan.
You can play with this all you want.	O le mu awọn pẹlu yi gbogbo awọn ti o fẹ.
Many feel that is enough.	Ọpọlọpọ lero pe iyẹn ti to.
She tried to continue her education.	O gbiyanju lati tẹsiwaju ẹkọ rẹ.

This is not for my company or for me.	Eyi kii ṣe fun ile-iṣẹ mi tabi fun mi.
But it has already done.	Ṣugbọn o ti ṣe tẹlẹ.

He wants me to sit.	O fe mi joko.
I just can't believe it won.	Mo kan ko le gbagbọ o ti gba.
Most people agree.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan gba.
The eyelids are well below the eyelids.	Oju daradara kun ni isalẹ oju.
You obviously hate this guy.	O han gbangba pe o korira eniyan yii.
The boy's friend's family came to visit.	Idile ọrẹ ọmọkunrin naa wa lati ṣabẹwo.
Now you need rest.	Bayi o nilo isinmi.
That's all well and good.	Ti o ni gbogbo daradara ati ki o dara.
There is nothing wrong with simplicity.	Ko si ohun ti ko tọ si pẹlu rọrun.
And it will not stop there.	Ati pe kii yoo da duro nibẹ.
But he has never been back there from high school.	Ṣugbọn ko ti pada wa nibẹ lati ile-iwe giga.
I don’t know why they hate us.	Emi ko mọ idi ti wọn fi korira wa.
But it can't help.	Ṣugbọn ko le ṣe iranlọwọ.
Wait, maybe not one of them.	Duro, boya kii ṣe ọkan ninu wọn.
Or we are alone.	Tabi a wa nikan.
You know things.	O ni imọran awọn nkan.
With good reason, even.	Pẹlu idi ti o dara, paapaa.
Of course there was good money to be had then.	Dajudaju nibẹ wà ti o dara owo lati wa ni kan ki o si.
She wants to live her life with him.	O fẹ lati ṣe igbesi aye rẹ pẹlu rẹ.
Sure, we come from old school.	Daju, a wa lati ile-iwe atijọ.
It turns out not so much.	O wa ni jade ko bẹ Elo.
You can not understand what people are talking about.	O ko le loye ohun ti eniyan n sọrọ nipa.
I stand in your way.	Mo duro ni ọna rẹ.
You can feel it.	O le lero rẹ.
Time to do something.	Akoko lati se nkankan.
Either way, take advantage of them.	Ni gbogbo ọna, lo anfani wọn.
I tried to get a good picture of it.	Mo gbiyanju lati gba kan ti o dara aworan ti o.

I see he has not told you about that.	Mo rii pe ko ti sọ fun ọ nipa iyẹn.
I ask you.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ.
No you, no game.	Rara iwọ, ko si ere.
He decided not to try that new restaurant.	O pinnu lati ma gbiyanju ile ounjẹ tuntun yẹn.
We have no doubt.	A ko ṣiyemeji.
The rules of this place changed.	Awọn ofin ti ibi yii yipada.
Children are vulnerable.	Awọn ọmọde ni ipalara.
It looks beautiful.	O dabi lẹwa.
But they just do not understand.	Ṣugbọn wọn kan ko loye.
So through this point.	Nitorina nipasẹ aaye yii.
They are very easy to use now.	O rọrun pupọ lati lo wọn ni bayi.
Maybe in a year or two.	Boya ni ọdun kan tabi meji.
I can think of taking a break.	Mo le ronu lati gba isinmi kan.
He knew he had to bring something else to the table.	O mọ pe o ni lati mu nkan miiran wa si tabili.
I don’t see anything like them at all.	Emi ko rii ohunkohun bi wọn rara.
I don't think so.	Emi ko ronu.
We have seen your last moments.	A ti rii awọn akoko ikẹhin rẹ.
Keep them away.	Pa wọn lọ.

You will need to talk to your doctor.	Iwọ yoo nilo lati ba dokita rẹ sọrọ.

I would plan it as a surprise.	Emi yoo gbero rẹ bi iyalẹnu.
You have to stop the bad guys from doing evil.	O ni lati da awọn eniyan buburu duro lati ṣe ibi.

They do not want to.	Wọn ko fẹ.

Let us know what it is.	Jẹ ki a mọ eyi ti o jẹ.
This is true of life.	Eyi jẹ otitọ si igbesi aye.
You will not let the body like it.	O yoo ko jẹ ki ara fẹ u.
You can get anything.	O le gba ohunkohun.
He was on his way over his head.	O wa ni ọna lori ori rẹ.
I hope so.	Mo nireti bẹ.
I would look good starting on that game my age.	Emi yoo wo daradara ti o bẹrẹ lori ere yẹn ọjọ ori mi.
Please do not or do not rely on what you read here.	Jọwọ maṣe ṣe tabi maṣe ṣe da lori nkan ti o ka nibi.
We have all been thinking about it.	Gbogbo wa ni a ti ro lori rẹ.

Little by little, hours passed.	Diẹ diẹ, awọn wakati ti kọja.
For us, simple money.	Fun wa, o rọrun owo.
I had to worry about all these worlds.	Mo ni lati ṣe aniyan nipa gbogbo awọn aye wọnyi.
He slept a lot.	O sun pupọ.
She would never let herself be loved.	O yoo ko jẹ ki ara fẹ u.
But it takes time.	Sugbon o gba akoko.
We are just going to give up.	A ti wa ni o kan lilọ lati fun soke.
That’s not at all either.	Iyẹn kii ṣe rara boya.
That may explain it.	Iyẹn le ṣe alaye rẹ.
I know he is.	Mo mọ pe oun ni.
It's too fast.	O n yara ju.
None of the kids had a phone.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ọmọde ti o ni foonu kan.
It takes them into the workplace.	O gba wọn sinu aaye iṣẹ.
Just don’t think of these things.	O kan ko ronu nkan wọnyi.
And he did not live.	Ati pe ko gbe.
Don't kill me.	Maṣe pa mi.
No one played the game.	Ko si ọkan ṣe ere naa.
Just a few can go a long way.	O kan diẹ le lọ si ọna pipẹ.
Everyone needs trees.	Gbogbo eniyan nilo awọn igi.
No one is on it.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa lori rẹ.
It gets you there early.	O gba ọ wa nibẹ ni kutukutu.
You don't want to ask it.	O ko fẹ lati beere o.
It should be the same here.	O yẹ ki o jẹ kanna nibi.
But no one wants to see.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹ lati rii.
He killed my father.	O pa baba mi.
I’ve dropped it a few times.	Mo ti sọ silẹ ni igba diẹ.
Or to me.	Tabi si mi.
You never said anything bad about anyone.	O ko so nkankan buburu nipa ẹnikẹni.
I can't believe it now.	Nko le gbagbọ bayi.
Stay with them.	Duro pẹlu wọn.
It is late in the afternoon.	O ti pẹ ni ọsan.
He will receive the gift in the wrong way.	Oun yoo gba ẹbun naa ni ọna ti ko tọ.
See for yourself below.	Wo fun ara rẹ ni isalẹ.
I can sell that too.	Mo tun le ta iyẹn naa.
And yet they did not listen.	Ati sibẹsibẹ wọn ko gbọ.
The story is based on two high school students.	Itan naa da lori awọn ọmọ ile-iwe giga meji.
We do not know what to do.	A ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
Let them ask questions.	Jẹ ki wọn beere awọn ibeere.
You will have to exit.	Iwọ yoo ni lati jade.
Your word so does not.	Ọrọ rẹ bẹ ko ṣe bẹẹ.
You feel that you need more.	O lero wipe o nilo diẹ sii.
But that’s because they are not.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn nitori pe wọn kii ṣe.
This does not happen when it is new.	Eyi ko ṣe nigbati o jẹ tuntun.
I have done this before.	Mo ti ṣe eyi tẹlẹ.
However, there is.	Sibẹsibẹ, o wa.
He hopes you did the right thing.	O nireti pe o ṣe ohun ti o tọ.
That is something we need to change.	Iyẹn jẹ nkan ti a nilo lati yipada.
It is pretty beyond words.	O ti wa ni lẹwa kọja ọrọ.
They are married and you are not.	Wọn ti ni iyawo ati pe iwọ ko.
I did not expect him to be friends with his mother.	Emi ko nireti pe yoo ṣe ọrẹ pẹlu iya rẹ.
Here is what will happen now.	Eyi ni ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ ni bayi.
Because that is the eye.	Nitori oju niyen.
Until the decision.	Titi di ipinnu.
I am here to stay.	Mo wa nibi lati duro.
Of course, there is so much more.	Dajudaju, o wa pupọ diẹ sii.
It’s all a game, from top to bottom.	Gbogbo rẹ jẹ ere, lati oke de isalẹ.
The problem is read in that way.	Iṣoro naa ni wọn ka ni ọna yẹn.
Your speech will stop.	Ọrọ rẹ yoo duro.
I doubt you have a lot of money of your own.	Mo ṣiyemeji pe o ni owo pupọ ti tirẹ.
I live a good life.	Mo ṣe igbesi aye to dara.
That he was convinced.	Wipe o ni idaniloju.
It hasn’t changed much.	Ko ti yipada pupọ.
It should be, but it is not.	O yẹ lati jẹ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe.
Let me give you this.	Jẹ ki n fi eyi fun ọ.
He doesn’t like the games they play.	Ko fẹran awọn ere ti wọn ṣe.
They think it should continue forever.	Wọn ro pe o yẹ ki o tẹsiwaju lailai.
This did not happen.	Eyi ko ṣẹlẹ.
I know how to listen.	Mo mọ bi a ṣe le gbọ.
I can't speak right now.	Emi ko le sọrọ ni bayi.
This went on for hours.	Eleyi lọ lori fun wakati.
She is his wife.	Iyawo re ni.
The work is done, either way.	Iṣẹ naa ti ṣe, boya ọna.
But such a thing does not help you.	Ṣugbọn iru nkan bẹẹ ko ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ.
It is a wonderful story.	Itan iyanu ni.
It is always promising at the same time.	O jẹ nigbagbogbo ileri ni akoko kanna.
Maybe it wasn’t even important when you asked.	Boya o ti ko paapaa ṣe pataki nigbati o beere.
We did not contact you.	A ko kan ibi rẹ.
This is a book written.	Eyi ni iwe ti a kọ.
That would be nice.	Iyẹn yoo dara.
And he loves it.	Ati pe o nifẹ rẹ.
It would be a mistake to do so.	Yoo jẹ aṣiṣe lati ṣe.
They are just a little girl.	Wọn jẹ ọmọbirin kekere nikan.
I know you well enough.	Mo mọ ọ daradara to.
Could have been a little more, could have been a little less.	Le ti jẹ diẹ diẹ sii, le ti jẹ diẹ kere.
I need to tell.	Mo nilo lati so fun.
It was so great.	O je ki nla.
The trip took about two weeks.	Irin-ajo naa gba bii ọsẹ meji.
I think that’s the most important thing.	Mo ro pe iyẹn ni pataki julọ.
Sometimes it works.	Nigba miiran o ṣiṣẹ.
I’ll get you up on that.	Emi yoo gba ọ soke lori iyẹn.
I decided to take my father’s advice.	Mo pinnu lati gba imọran baba mi.
She is the woman.	Obinrin naa ni.
He changed it.	O yi i pada.
And that will be.	Ati pe iyẹn yoo jẹ.
Ways and on.	Awọn ọna ati lori.
Very good question.	Gan ti o dara ibeere.
I tried and tried.	Mo gbiyanju ati gbiyanju.
Now is our time.	Bayi o jẹ akoko wa.
But no I do not know what I am.	Ṣugbọn rara Emi ko mọ kini emi.
Here is a picture of one.	Eyi ni aworan ti ọkan.
Don't just stop there.	Maṣe da duro nibẹ nikan.
And it can be good.	Ati pe o le dara.
As originally intended.	Bi ni akọkọ ti a ti pinnu.
It doesn't matter at all.	Maṣe ṣe pataki rara.
John may not be able to make mistakes here.	John ko le ni anfani lati ṣe awọn aṣiṣe nibi.
He has not done this before.	Ko ṣe eyi tẹlẹ.
However, nothing was done.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko si ohun ti a ṣe.
It was a great deal.	O jẹ adehun nla.
We cannot afford to treat people this way.	A ko le ni anfani lati tọju eniyan ni ọna yii.
You never remember to see it open.	O ko ranti lailai lati ri i ti o ṣii.
And what you know, you know.	Ati ohun ti o mọ, o mọ.
I think we would be better off leaving here.	Mo ro pe a yoo dara lati lọ kuro nibi.
I want the rain to stop.	Mo fẹ ki ojo ko duro.
Try the recipe and tell me what you think.	Gbiyanju ounjẹ naa ki o sọ fun mi kini o ro.
Once inside we may not leave.	Ni kete ti o wọ inu a le ma lọ kuro.
Nothing has really changed.	Ko si ohun ti gan ti yi pada.
She will love it.	O yoo nifẹ rẹ.
How to touch.	Bawo ni lati fi ọwọ kan.
I started to really like it.	Mo bẹrẹ si fẹran rẹ gaan.
No one saw anything wrong with it.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o rii ohunkohun ti ko tọ pẹlu rẹ.
You are the only one in the end.	Iwọ nikan wa ni ipari.
This forces your children to work if they want more.	Eyi fi agbara mu awọn ọmọ rẹ lati ṣiṣẹ ti wọn ba fẹ diẹ sii.
He knew he didn't get it.	O mọ pe ko gba oun.
He did not stop.	O ko duro.
It seems good when you do it that way.	O dabi pe o dara nigbati o ba ṣe ni ọna yẹn.
Got some.	Ti gba diẹ.
And it was good.	Ati pe o dara.
In this test ,.	Ninu idanwo yii,.
How it all came back to me.	Bawo ni gbogbo rẹ ṣe pada si ọdọ mi.
It’s very easy after that.	O rọrun pupọ lẹhin iyẹn.
It will take days.	Yoo gba awọn ọjọ.
But they could not identify the man.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko le da ọkunrin naa mọ.
You want the thing to end.	O fẹ ki nkan naa pari.
This is not our game.	Eyi kii ṣe ti ere wa.
Not much in our marriage.	Ko Elo ni igbeyawo wa.
That you did this.	Pe o ṣe eyi.
He will die here.	Oun yoo ku nibi.
You know, we can do it.	O mọ, a le ṣe.
We miss it so much.	A tun padanu rẹ bẹ.
You know, all the time.	O mọ, ni gbogbo igba.
But my point is that now you have friends.	Ṣugbọn ọrọ mi ni pe ni bayi o ni awọn ọrẹ.
It’s the best thing we can do.	O jẹ ohun ti o dara julọ ti a le ṣe.
But! 	Sugbon!
Many of the students who met me did not do well.	Pupọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ti o pade mi ko ṣe daradara.
Better yet.	Dara ju.
In winter, die of winter	Ni otutu, ku ti igba otutu
You must find out what the problem is.	O gbọdọ wa kini iṣoro naa.
It won't be long until that good string breaks.	Kii yoo pẹ titi ti okun ti o dara yẹn yoo fi fọ.
However, this week they may have just made their biggest mistake.	Sibẹsibẹ, ni ọsẹ yii wọn le ti ṣe aṣiṣe nla wọn nikan.
Write or take into the box.	Kọ tabi ya sinu apoti.
Of such rules.	Ti iru awọn ofin.
I'm not happy at all.	Inu mi ko dun rara.
This is the only water in the place.	Eyi jẹ omi nikan ni ibi.
This has been around for a long time.	Eyi ti wa ni ayika igba pipẹ.
She is a woman.	Obinrin ni.
Now we need to do two things.	Bayi a nilo lati ṣe awọn nkan meji.
Continue as before.	Tẹsiwaju bi o ti n sọ tẹlẹ.
Good meeting you, man.	O dara ipade ti o, ọkunrin.
It’s a great love.	O jẹ ifẹ nla kan.
Money, he said.	Owo, o sọ.
And don’t worry about it.	Ati ki o ma ṣe aniyan nipa rẹ.
This just works.	Eyi kan ṣiṣẹ.
But do not say.	Ṣugbọn maṣe sọ.
You don’t run anything.	O ko ṣiṣe ohunkohun.
The phone is ringing in the room.	Foonu ti dun ninu yara.
Something to give.	Nkankan ni lati fun.
Sometimes I try to remember.	Nigba miiran Mo n gbiyanju lati ranti.
Maybe he will die before the year comes out.	Boya o yoo ku ki ọdun to jade.
He is the father.	Oun ni baba naa.
I just found it hard to say.	Mo kan rii pe o nira lati sọ.
I haven’t seen him in thirty years.	Emi ko tii ri i fun ọgbọn ọdun.
He got his father on the phone.	O gba baba rẹ lori foonu.
If they can still stand on their feet.	Ti wọn ba tun le duro lori ẹsẹ wọn.
My legs gave out.	Ẹsẹ mi fun mi jade.
It doesn’t hurt much more.	Ko ṣe ipalara pupọ diẹ sii.
He twisted his hair with his hands.	O si yi irun ori rẹ pẹlu ọwọ rẹ.
I can only believe that his mother must be behind him.	Mo le gbagbọ nikan pe iya rẹ gbọdọ wa lẹhin rẹ.
You are not on your own at all.	Iwọ ko wa lori ara rẹ rara.
Who kept the picture.	Tani pa aworan.
It's my thing.	Nkan mi ni.
Few wear them however.	Diẹ wọ wọn sibẹsibẹ.
But they must not be afraid.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko gbọdọ bẹru.
She is a sister.	Arabinrin ni.
Maybe they know where it goes.	Boya wọn mọ ibi ti o lọ.
You never know how a book will perform.	O ko mọ bi iwe kan yoo ṣe.
I love that kind of thing.	Mo nifẹ iru nkan bẹẹ.
Only to find you.	Nikan lati wa ọ.
So we tried both.	Nitorina a gbiyanju awọn mejeeji.
Okay, so there you have it.	O dara, nitorina o wa iyẹn.
Someone is not your mother.	Ẹnikan kii ṣe iya rẹ.
You do not have time to look.	O ko ni akoko lati wo.
That is the first thing.	Ohun akọkọ niyẹn.
Either way, you have to give them.	Ọna boya, o ni lati fi fun wọn.
But his life has changed forever.	Ṣugbọn igbesi aye rẹ ti yipada lailai.
Your song is about love that is new.	Orin rẹ jẹ nipa ifẹ ti o jẹ tuntun.
We missed that a long time ago.	A padanu iyẹn ni igba pipẹ sẹhin.
And he spent his whole life here!	O si lo gbogbo aye re nibi!
Work must be carried out at night.	Iṣẹ gbọdọ wa ni ti gbe jade ni alẹ.
The test can.	Idanwo le.
We don’t know much about personal life in recent years.	A ko mọ pupọ nipa igbesi aye ara ẹni ni awọn ọdun wọnyi.
We are becoming more solid.	A ti wa ni di diẹ ri to.
It is the same as with it.	O jẹ kanna bi pẹlu rẹ.
It has moved on.	O ti gbe lori.
At least now they have got their books out.	O kere ju bayi wọn ti ni awọn iwe wọn jade.
He sat hard.	O joko lile.
We have to decide our heart.	A ni lati pinnu ọkan wa.
I don’t use much to this, however.	Emi ko lo pupọ si eyi, sibẹsibẹ.
Maybe a day or two.	Boya ọjọ kan tabi meji.
Too much love.	Ife pupo ju.
The water is gone.	Omi ti ya kuro.
Try to cut your bread more thoroughly.	Gbiyanju lati ge akara rẹ diẹ sii daradara.
These cats are home.	Awọn ologbo wọnyi jẹ ile.
Children do not learn well when they are under stress.	Awọn ọmọde ko kọ ẹkọ daradara nigbati wọn ba wa labẹ wahala.
You can do what you want.	O le ṣe ohun ti o fẹ.
We need you to be with us.	A nilo ki o wa pẹlu wa.
I don’t think they know anything.	Emi ko ro pe wọn mọ nkankan.
I think it has moved through at least one previous winter.	Mo ro pe o ti gbe nipasẹ o kere kan igba otutu ti tẹlẹ.
I am using now.	Mo n lo ni bayi.
He quickly looked at the story.	O yara wo itan naa.
You don't want to go.	O ko fẹ lọ.
We can walk by the river.	A le rin nipasẹ odo.
I don’t think they are.	Emi ko ro pe wọn jẹ.
For a long time, no one said a word.	Fun igba pipẹ, ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ọrọ kan.
But there is also an issue at hand.	Ṣugbọn ọrọ kan tun wa ni ọwọ.
That’s the whole story.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo itan naa.
It is time to think about our future.	O to akoko lati ronu nipa ọjọ iwaju wa.
She loves to do something.	O nifẹ lati ṣe nkan.
The story is mainly about the old man.	Awọn itan jẹ o kun nipa atijọ eniyan.
I can not see you.	Nko le ri e.
Many of them have already been arrested.	Pupọ ninu wọn ni wọn ti mu wa tẹlẹ.
I have to wake him up.	Mo ni lati ji i.
I think we can get from here.	Mo ro pe a le gba lati ibi.
He stays home during the holidays.	O duro si ile nigba awọn isinmi.
When you go out, put on your clothes.	Nigbati o ba jade, wọ aṣọ rẹ.
I'm looking at myself.	Mo n wo mi.
I will change.	Emi yoo yipada.
Sometimes, the decision to move is made for you.	Nigba miiran, ipinnu lati gbe ni a ṣe fun ọ.
I can not have.	Nko le ni.
The amount of time this does not matter.	Iye akoko yii ko ṣe pataki.
There is nothing about it that makes sense.	Ko si nkankan nipa eyi ti o ni oye.
And when it was her husband.	Ati igba ti o jẹ ọkọ rẹ.
I am not sure they will believe me.	Emi ko da mi loju pe wọn yoo gba mi gbọ.
I'm up.	Mo wa soke.
I have to go back.	Mo gbọdọ pada.
Kind of with music.	Iru pẹlu orin.
But cars are coming up and down the road.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti n bọ si oke ati isalẹ ni opopona naa.
In fact, it is always a game in the workplace.	Ni otitọ, o jẹ ere nigbagbogbo ni ibi iṣẹ.
We need it now.	A nilo rẹ ni bayi.
No one, ever.	Ko si ẹnikan, lailai.
Stay out of trouble.	Duro kuro ninu wahala.
Let’s do things, they say.	Jẹ ki a ṣe awọn nkan, wọn sọ.
That's how good it is.	Bi o ṣe dara niyẹn.
We all learn about this through stuff.	Gbogbo wa kọ nipa eyi nipasẹ awọn nkan.
But it is too late.	Sugbon o ti pẹ ju.
Now is my time.	Bayi ni akoko mi.
I enjoyed the old game.	Mo gbadun ere atijọ naa.
Not a word from anyone to anyone.	Ko ọrọ kan lati ẹnikẹni si ẹnikẹni.
I do not hate it.	Emi ko korira rẹ.
You have to get out of there.	O ni lati jade kuro nibẹ.
Now, here it is again.	Bayi, nibi o tun wa.
Two children in two houses.	Awọn ọmọde meji ni ile meji.
Good for a little bit for my life.	O dara fun diẹ diẹ fun igbesi aye mi.
I said we broke up that night.	Mo sọ pe a ya kuro ni alẹ yẹn.
It can even change.	O le paapaa yipada.
Very good one.	Ọkan ti o dara pupọ.
They will all agree.	Gbogbo wọn yoo gba.
Many wives and families arose.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn iyawo ati awọn idile dide.
The place also has a history of the past.	Ibi naa tun ni itan ti o ti kọja.
Fun activities don’t matter.	Awọn iṣẹ ṣiṣe dun ko ṣe pataki.
Everyone does it now.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o ṣe ni bayi.
If you like them, fine.	Ti o ba fẹran wọn, o dara.
You want what you want.	O fẹ ohun ti o fẹ.
Same afternoon.	Ọsan kanna.
That says something.	Ti o n sọ nkan kan.
I will do my best.	Emi yoo ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
He hit his head.	O lu ori rẹ.
Things can’t sit still.	Awọn nkan ko le joko jẹ.
I'm happy for you.	Inu mi dun fun yin.
At least a little.	O kere diẹ.
I have to be on time for the school.	Mo ni lati wa ni akoko fun ile-iwe naa.
The first thing is to read the programs.	Ohun akọkọ ni lati ka awọn eto naa.
You have spoken your words.	O ti sọ ọrọ rẹ.
However, trouble is the way to find it.	Sibẹsibẹ, wahala ni ọna lati wa a.
In other words, you can.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, o le.
She told him she had a cold.	O sọ fun u pe o ni otutu.
You don’t want to laugh now.	O ko fẹ lati rẹrin bayi.
I'm convinced we had something wrong there, too.	Mo da mi loju pe a ni nkan ti ko tọ si nibẹ, paapaa.
You have no idea.	O ko ni ero.
Nothing serious.	Ko si ohun to ṣe pataki.
It just grew up.	O kan dagba soke.
No one will have good information.	Ko si ọkan ti yoo ni alaye to dara.
This will not be beautiful.	Eyi kii yoo jẹ lẹwa.
And it was amazing.	Ati pe o jẹ iyanu.
Or it could be something else.	Tabi o le jẹ nkan miiran.
He would have taught me to drive.	Oun yoo ti kọ mi lati wakọ.
So you never miss a job.	Nitorina o ko padanu iṣẹ kankan.
There is no way I will ever get back to you.	Ko si ọna ti emi yoo pada si ọdọ rẹ lailai.
I sleep well now that the weather is warm.	Mo sun dara ni bayi pe oju ojo ti gbona.
It is not your time.	Kii ṣe akoko rẹ.
The program seems to be in good shape.	Eto naa dabi pe o dara ni imọran.
Well this can get interesting.	Daradara yi le gba awon.
You busy.	O n ṣiṣẹ lọwọ.
He did not leave.	O ko ya kuro.
That all works, for nothing.	Gbogbo iyẹn ṣiṣẹ, fun ohunkohun.
He decided to change his importance.	O pinnu lati yi pataki rẹ pada.
Some of my friends gave us old high school.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọrẹ mi fun wa atijọ ile-iwe giga.
Help is on the way.	Iranlọwọ wa ni ọna.
He enjoyed a little more.	O gbadun diẹ diẹ.
They heard you talking through me.	Wọn gbọ ti o sọrọ nipasẹ mi.
It is also growing.	O tun dagba sii paapaa.
And if you have.	Ati pe ti o ba ni.
I have no idea why this did not work.	Emi ko ni imọran idi ti eyi ko ṣiṣẹ.
Let the money rise.	Jẹ ki owo naa dide.
I will kill you.	Emi yoo pa ọ.
Good for us.	O dara fun wa.
Obviously that will not happen.	O han ni iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
We will not sit in a tree.	A o joko ni igi.
That after all is the whole question.	Iyẹn lẹhin gbogbo ni gbogbo ibeere.
No problems, just a few questions.	Ko si awọn iṣoro, o kan awọn ibeere diẹ.
But not my father.	Sugbon ko baba mi.
This is old.	Eleyi jẹ atijọ.
Parents are also here.	Awọn obi tun wa nibi.
I will not walk away from it.	Emi kii yoo rin kuro ninu rẹ.
This time a clothing store.	Ni akoko yii ile itaja aṣọ kan.
Obviously the money in it.	O han ni owo ninu.
Pictures live on.	Awọn aworan ngbe lori.
You know that.	O mọ iyẹn.
Terms you are working on or thinking about.	Awọn ofin ti o n ṣiṣẹ lori tabi ni ero nipa.
So this is the idea.	Nitorina eyi ni ero naa.
So the story goes.	Nitorina itan naa lọ.
That is another matter.	Ọrọ miiran niyẹn.
Maybe better than anyone.	Boya dara ju ẹnikẹni lọ.
But only on paper.	Sugbon nikan lori iwe.
Everyone knows what works and it starts with the parents.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ ati pe o bẹrẹ pẹlu awọn obi.
This summer down!	Yi ooru si isalẹ!
We will learn a lesson.	A yoo kọ ẹkọ kan.
The sister will see what happens.	Arabinrin naa yoo rii ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
His mother lives with him.	Iya rẹ n gbe pẹlu rẹ.
But it still has something to do with me.	Sugbon o ni si tun nkankan lati se pẹlu mi.
Buy more bread.	Ra akara diẹ sii.
A year ago, every year, he lost people to injury.	Ni ọdun kan sẹhin, ni gbogbo ọdun, o padanu awọn eniyan si ipalara.
You can't tell anyone.	O ko le sọ fun ẹnikẹni.
That goes for everyone.	Iyẹn lọ fun gbogbo eniyan.
I'm trying to do something like this.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ṣe bi eleyi.
What you are saying is that you should do what you want.	Ohun ti o sọ ni pe ki o ṣe ohun ti o fẹ.
It is done.	O ti ṣe.
I think he did a really good job there.	Mo ro pe o ṣe kan gan ti o dara ise nibẹ.
It has a hardware store.	O ni ile itaja ohun elo kan.
In fact most of them do not.	Ni otitọ ọpọlọpọ wọn ko ṣe.
Don't get caught or caught.	Maṣe ri wọn mu tabi rii.
Run it through me still.	Ṣiṣe awọn ti o nipasẹ mi si tun.
He has a brother.	O ni arakunrin kan.
You do not understand.	O ko loye.
I missed it so much.	Mo ti padanu rẹ bẹ.
And that's about all there is to it.	Ati awọn ti o ni nipa gbogbo nibẹ ni lati o.
I don’t know if you have to have one.	Emi ko mọ pe o ni lati ni ọkan.
All three died in the game.	Awọn mẹta naa ku ninu ere naa.
And it ended.	Ati pe o pari.
So he continued to eat.	Nitorina o tẹsiwaju lati jẹun.
They have run out of money.	Wọn ti pari ti owo.
It looks amazing, he said.	O dabi iyanu, o sọ.
Remember and.	Ranti ati.
And no other word was said.	Ati pe ko si ọrọ miiran ti a sọ.
Get one a day at a time.	Gba ni ọjọ kan ni akoko kan.
It just doesn't.	O kan ko ni.
That doesn't help.	Iyẹn ko ṣe iranlọwọ.
No, it is someone.	Rara, ẹnikan ni.
He was my best friend at the time.	O jẹ ọrẹ mi to dara julọ ni akoko yẹn.
You have to leave.	O ni lati lọ kuro.
Young people should want to grow.	Awọn nkan ọdọ yẹ ki o fẹ lati dagba.
It is a new city, not an old city.	Ilu tuntun ni, kii ṣe ilu atijọ.
Maybe he was one of them.	Boya o jẹ ọkan ninu wọn.
As well as their people.	Bi daradara bi wọn eniyan.
He says no one likes him.	O sọ pe ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹran rẹ.
Come with me if you want to move.	Wa pẹlu mi ti o ba fẹ gbe.
It will take some time, you know.	Yoo gba igba diẹ, o mọ.
The girls who lived at home returned in a few minutes.	Awọn ọmọbirin ti o ngbe ni ile pada ni iṣẹju diẹ.
For a few hours, your body will feel better.	Fun wakati diẹ, ara rẹ yoo dara.
Will do if they return to power.	Yoo ṣe ti wọn ba pada si agbara.
Good life education.	Ẹkọ igbesi aye to dara.
Of course you know.	Dajudaju o mọ.
That is a fact.	Otitọ niyẹn.
This is the first story written.	Eyi ni itan akọkọ ti a kọ.
That’s what we want to have.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti a fẹ lati ni.
Don't let me do that again.	Maṣe jẹ ki n ṣe iyẹn lẹẹkansi.
I do not understand why we are doing this.	Emi ko loye idi ti a fi n ṣe eyi.
They let us feel.	Wọn jẹ ki a lero.
They also asked me.	Wọn tun beere lọwọ mi.
Not even more.	Ko paapaa diẹ.
I love a new outfit!	Mo nifẹ aṣọ tuntun kan!
When completed, the building will be the tallest here.	Nigbati o ba pari, ile naa yoo jẹ giga julọ nibi.
He came back.	O tun pada.
The sister was also happy.	Arabinrin naa tun dun.
He’s not there yet.	O ko wa nibẹ sibẹsibẹ.
It looks new.	O dabi tuntun.
This is the way with dogs.	Eyi ni ọna pẹlu awọn aja.
That’s hours a day, not years in life.	Iyẹn jẹ awọn wakati ni ọjọ kan, kii ṣe awọn ọdun ni igbesi aye.
If there is a way.	Ti o ba jẹ pe ọna kan wa.
The plane is full.	Ọkọ ofurufu ti kun.

They did not see the boat coming.	Wọn ko ri ọkọ oju omi ti nbọ.
From one of the top law schools.	Lati ọkan ninu awọn ile-iwe ofin oke.
They do not know how much more time they can have.	Wọn ko mọ iye awọn akoko diẹ sii bi eyi ti wọn le ni.
He loves it very much.	O nifẹ rẹ pupọ.
I looked at the house.	Mo wo ile naa.
Use your common sense and things should go well.	Lo ọgbọn ori rẹ ati pe ohun yẹ ki o lọ daradara.
I agree to make my own rules.	Mo gba lati ṣe awọn ofin ti ara mi.
For two days.	Fun ọjọ meji.
You may have to eat.	O le ni lati jẹ.
I have to go.	Mo ni lati lọ.
No one did.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe.
I hope it's raining.	Mo nireti pe ojo ti de.
No time to miss!	Ko si akoko lati padanu!
In his heart, he heard and understood it.	Ninu ọkan rẹ, o gbọ o si loye rẹ.
If you have children, play a game in it.	Ti o ba ni awọn ọmọde, ṣe ere kan ninu rẹ.
And he is not here.	Ati pe ko si nibi.
I don’t have a big game.	Emi ko ni ere nla kan.
I always come up with something sweet.	Mo nigbagbogbo pẹlu nkan ti o dun.
You did not miss anything.	O ko padanu ohunkohun.
What does your body look like.	Kini ara rẹ dabi.
It’s not about what the big dog is.	Kii ṣe nipa kini aja nla ti o jẹ.
This is to put food in.	Eyi ni lati fi ounjẹ sinu.
It was his life.	O jẹ igbesi aye rẹ.
But it really got hard.	Ṣugbọn o gba gaan ni lile.
Get out of the way.	Jade kuro ni ọna.
Do the songs say what you mean?	Njẹ awọn orin orin naa sọ kini o tumọ si?
They are one and the same person.	Wọn jẹ ọkan ati eniyan kanna.
He said he had no drinking problems.	O sọ pe oun ko ni iṣoro mimu.
However, this is not possible right now for two reasons.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi ko ṣee ṣe ni bayi fun awọn idi meji.
We have no children.	A ko ni ọmọ.
Or so you think.	Tabi ki o ro.
The sun still does not rise.	Oorun si tun ko soke.
I am sure someone can find them.	Mo ni idaniloju pe ẹnikan le wa wọn.
She knew he would say anything to her.	O mọ pe oun yoo sọ ohunkohun fun u.
No, nothing tonight.	Rara, ko si nkankan ni alẹ oni.
I think it hurts.	Mo ro pe o ṣe ipalara.
It will not happen to him that what should be, may not be.	Kii yoo ṣẹlẹ fun u pe ohun ti gbọdọ jẹ, le ma ṣe.
Which newspaper did you read?	Iwe iroyin wo ni o ka?
He doesn't talk much about it at all.	Ko sọrọ pupọ nipa rẹ rara.
They are in a bad way here.	Wọn wa ni ọna buburu nibi.
We need more.	A nilo diẹ sii.
The time will come.	Akoko naa yoo de.
I just gave it a hard time.	Mo kan fun u ni akoko lile.
The highest concerns are the perception of images.	Awọn iṣoro ti o ga julọ ni imọran awọn aworan.
I won’t sell it to you, either.	Emi kii yoo ta a fun ọ, boya.
I did not ask him.	Emi ko beere lọwọ rẹ.
She’s a working girl, especially.	O jẹ ọmọbirin ti n ṣiṣẹ, paapaa.
Love is true in itself.	Ifẹ jẹ otitọ funrararẹ.
I refuse to give that promise.	Mo kọ lati fun ni ileri yẹn.
It’s still home, but it’s more than that.	O tun jẹ ile, ṣugbọn o jẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
People find their way here.	Eniyan wa ọna wọn nibi.
Some families have a car these days.	Diẹ ninu awọn idile ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
You have read the book several times.	O ti ka iwe naa ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
I would like to be about people.	Emi yoo fẹ ki a jẹ nipa awọn eniyan.
He will be on the high school team.	Oun yoo wa ni ẹgbẹ ile-iwe giga.
Down again.	Ni isalẹ lẹẹkansi.
Read your environment.	Ka ayika rẹ.
It’s not about the amount of stuff you have.	Kii ṣe nipa iye nkan ti o ni.
He took care of her.	O tọju rẹ.
Very hard to hear this.	Gan gidigidi lati gbọ eyi.
Once this is life.	Ni kete ti eyi ti jẹ igbesi aye.
He has decided on it and he has done it forever.	O ti pinnu lori rẹ ati pe o ti ṣe lailai.
There are several ways to do this.	Awọn ọna pupọ lo wa lati ṣe eyi.
Give them more of whatever they want.	Fun wọn diẹ sii ti ohunkohun ti wọn fẹ.
We don't have much money at all.	A ko ni owo pupọ rara.
I say this again.	Mo sọ eyi pada.
The past is done.	Ohun ti o ti kọja ṣaaju ti wa ni ṣe.
However, it is not the first.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe akọkọ.
Remember to turn off the lights.	Ranti lati pa awọn ina.
Whether we need it or not, we must buy.	Boya a nilo tabi ko, a gbọdọ ra.
I don’t recognize myself or my life.	Emi ko da ara mi mọ tabi igbesi aye mi.
I do not want to live.	Nko fe gbe.
I did well.	Mo ṣe daradara.
Who is not in it.	Tani ko si ninu.
I have them eating well.	Mo ni wọn jẹun daradara.
Just do not know the value.	O kan ko mọ iye.
If the weather has not moved, you will not notice it at all.	Ti oju ojo ko ba ti gbe, ko ni akiyesi rẹ rara.
He spoke a little.	O sọrọ diẹ.
And run three hours a day.	Ati ṣiṣe awọn wakati mẹta ni ọjọ kan.
It’s time we start to think.	O to akoko ti a bẹrẹ lati ronu.
Just let it go and.	O kan jẹ ki o lọ ati.
Their days are full of hard work, craftsmanship.	Awọn ọjọ wọn kun fun iṣẹ lile, iṣẹ ọwọ.
This is how we should do it.	Eyi ni bi o ṣe yẹ ki a ṣe.
Work on anything that isn’t really powerful.	Ṣiṣẹ lori ohunkohun ti ko ni agbara gaan.
You can't stand up inside.	O ko le dide duro ninu.
But more to the story.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii si itan naa.
It has no sense of fun.	O ni ko si ori ti fun.
Okay, they continue to call.	O dara, wọn tẹsiwaju lati pe.
Possibly important.	O ṣee ṣe pataki.
It will come into play.	Yoo wa sinu ere.
You do not ask for.	O ko beere fun.
Place the image field below it.	Gbe aaye aworan ni isalẹ rẹ.
He said he was convinced.	O sọ pe o da ọ loju.
This is your last chance.	Eleyi jẹ rẹ kẹhin anfani.
I would never agree to talk to any of them again.	Emi yoo ko gba lati sọrọ si eyikeyi ninu wọn lẹẹkansi.
She sat with her mouth open.	O joko pẹlu ẹnu rẹ.
Nor do we really expect them to be.	Tabi a ko nireti gaan pe wọn yoo jẹ.
What today.	Kini loni.
They have not seen them yet.	Wọn ko tii ri wọn sibẹsibẹ.
I was the only one in the house.	Emi nikan lo ni ile naa.
She did it for her mother.	O ṣe fun iya rẹ.
Give me some time.	Fun mi ni igba diẹ.
This restaurant has a long history.	Eleyi ounjẹ ni o ni kan gun itan.
Some will be the right kind of person, some will not.	Diẹ ninu yoo jẹ iru eniyan ti o tọ, diẹ ninu kii ṣe.
You feel that now.	O lero pe bayi.
Your mother will stay here with you.	Iya rẹ yoo duro nibi pẹlu rẹ.
Money will need from them again next year.	Owo yoo nilo lati ọdọ wọn lẹẹkansi ni ọdun ti n bọ.
One that is sometimes hard to keep up.	Ọkan ti o jẹ nigba miiran lile lati tọju.
Someone who makes you laugh.	Ẹnikan ti o mu ki o rẹrin.
I have to say this to you, okay.	Mo ni lati sọ eyi fun ọ, o dara.
Police say they believe it will be okay.	Ọlọpa sọ pe wọn gbagbọ pe yoo dara.
We let children learn about the world around us.	A jẹ ki awọn ọmọde kọ ẹkọ nipa aye ti o wa ni ayika wa.
You need to make your own decisions.	O nilo lati ṣe awọn ipinnu tirẹ.
I believe it will work.	Mo gbagbọ pe yoo ṣiṣẹ.
I'm glad you're here with me.	Inu mi dun pe o wa nibi pẹlu mi.
He said there was no such law.	O so wipe ko si iru ofin.
Open early for breakfast and lunch.	Ṣii ni kutukutu fun ounjẹ owurọ ati ounjẹ ọsan.
He did not tell anyone.	Ko sọ fun ẹnikẹni.
And we were not disappointed.	Ati awọn ti a wà ko adehun.
This is important here, and it is very important.	Eyi jẹ pataki nibi, ati pe o jẹ pataki pupọ.
But that did not happen.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ.
You can go with whatever you want.	O le lọ pẹlu ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
It's an accident.	O ni ijamba ni.
Our family.	Ebi wa.
I would have that amount.	Emi yoo ni iye iyẹn.
I just can't get enough.	Mo kan ko le gba to.
He asked me to move in with him.	O beere fun mi lati gbe ni pẹlu rẹ.
You know yourself better, not me.	O mọ ara rẹ dara julọ, kii ṣe emi.
The problem is that you write on the subject.	Iṣoro naa ni pe o kọ lori ọrọ naa.
It is difficult to make the words.	O nira lati ṣe awọn ọrọ naa.
Very low.	Ni isalẹ pupọ.
Today it is a matter of do or die.	Loni o jẹ ọrọ ti ṣe tabi ku.
We need to complete this.	A nilo lati pari eyi.
Whatever makes a lot of people happy, is good.	Ohunkohun ti o mu ki ọpọlọpọ eniyan dun, o dara.
He could not get the world he took back.	Ko le gba aye ti o gba pada.
That would be my dad.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ baba mi.
Come outside, to the garden, sister.	Wa si ita, si ọgba, arabinrin.
I know this will not suffice.	Mo mọ pe eyi kii yoo to.
I know how to know.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe le mọ.
It will not get away.	Ko ni gba kuro.
I have found myself.	Mo ti ri ara mi.
We do not know what to do.	A ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
And don't worry.	Ati pe ko ṣe aniyan.
I think it is one of the best.	Mo ro pe o jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ti o dara ju.
But you know that is not the case.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe kii ṣe bẹ.
But not yet.	Sugbon ko tii ri.
He has been dead for thirty years.	O ti ku fun ọgbọn ọdun.
That's what you can.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti o le.
I do not see anything.	Nko ri kankan.
That was my first.	Iyẹn ni akọkọ mi.
It is not going to happen.	Ko lilọ si ṣẹlẹ.
I're sorry for the inconvenience.	Mo binu ni ọjọ ti ko pari.
He made the rules of the group.	O ṣe awọn ofin ti ẹgbẹ.
I mean, look at your situation.	Mo tumọ si, wo ipo rẹ.
When will this train go?	Nigbawo ni ọkọ oju irin yii yoo lọ?
His family just fine for him.	Ebi re kan ti o dara fun u.
He was angry with the man on the plane.	O binu si ọkunrin ti o wa lori ọkọ ofurufu.
Let's not deal with it.	Jẹ ki a ma ba a.
Maybe even a month.	Boya paapaa oṣu kan.
It can happen any day, and last for several days.	O le ṣẹlẹ ni eyikeyi ọjọ, ati ṣiṣe fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọjọ.
I looked at her face at dinner last week.	Mo wo oju rẹ ni ounjẹ alẹ ni ọsẹ to kọja.
And it doesn’t take more years to get rid of a bad teacher.	Ko si gba awọn ọdun diẹ sii lati yọ olukọ buburu kuro.
My whole family will do.	Gbogbo idile mi ni yoo ṣe.
A life story.	Itan aye kan.
You have a gift.	O ni ẹbun kan.
I also lost my bed.	Mo tun padanu ibusun mi.
Or to both.	Tabi si awọn mejeeji.
There is nothing good or bad.	Ko si ohun ti o dara tabi buburu.
You have to learn to accept them.	O ni lati kọ ẹkọ lati gba wọn.
But we do not.	Sugbon a ko.
But they were not hungry.	Ṣugbọn ebi ko pa wọn.
I will not leave here.	Emi ko ni kuro nibi.
So there he sat.	Nitorina nibẹ o joko.
I will make you happy.	Emi yoo mu inu rẹ dun.
What a good boy.	Ohun ti o dara ọmọkunrin.
Not just playing in the field.	Ko kan ṣe ere ni aaye.
Love hard.	Ni ife ti o lile.
It went over his head.	O lọ si ori rẹ.
But it would seem to go beyond that.	Ṣugbọn yoo dabi pe o kọja iyẹn.
They are best friends.	Wọn jẹ ọrẹ to dara julọ.
We will not be able to eat at your house today.	A ko ni le jẹun ni ile rẹ loni.
They are only children.	Wọn jẹ ọmọde nikan.
No, nothing has changed.	Rara, ko si ohun ti o yipada.
No one should do that.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o yẹ ki o ṣe bẹ.
He picked up the phone.	O gba foonu naa.
People are walking down the road and on the road.	Awọn eniyan n rin ni isalẹ ọna ati ni opopona.
He entered the house, locked the door behind him.	O wọ inu ile naa, o ti ilẹkun lẹhin rẹ.
The area is not easy to find.	Agbegbe ko rọrun lati wa.
But it's happening.	Sugbon o n ṣẹlẹ.
We came to see why.	A wa lati rii idi naa.
Maybe you have gone to one.	Boya o ti lọ si ọkan.
I don’t really see the big picture happening around me.	Emi ko rii ni otitọ pe aworan nla ti n ṣẹlẹ ni ayika mi.
Thus, the most important questions are ‘where’ and ‘when’.	Bayi, awọn ibeere pataki julọ ni 'ibiti' ati 'nigbawo'.
Everything you want in one game and more.	Ohun gbogbo ti o fẹ ninu ere kan ati diẹ sii.
Life is beautiful because you can lose.	Igbesi aye lẹwa nitori pe o le padanu.
Of course, he would have liked this much.	Dajudaju, yoo ti fẹran eyi pupọ.
Can you tell me about this place.	Ṣe o le sọ fun mi nipa ibi yii.
You can eat with men.	O le jẹun pẹlu awọn ọkunrin.
They are all written with emotion.	Gbogbo wọn ni a kọ pẹlu rilara.
The company will pay them for their problems.	Ile-iṣẹ naa yoo san owo fun wọn fun awọn iṣoro wọn.
Everyone says so.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o sọ.
So they went to stop him.	Nitorina wọn lọ lati da a duro.
It’s something else to do with your hands.	O jẹ nkan miiran lati ṣe pẹlu ọwọ rẹ.
I did not hear anything of my own.	Emi ko gbọ ohunkohun ti iru ara mi.
He went with her.	O lọ pẹlu rẹ.
Make no mistake, however.	Maṣe ṣe aṣiṣe, sibẹsibẹ.
I stand back from the table.	Mo duro pada lati tabili.
It has a small population.	O ni iye eniyan kekere kan.
We know where we are from.	A mọ ibiti o ti wa.
You have known since the day you bought the place.	O ti mọ lati ọjọ ti o ra ibi naa.
I don't want anything to change.	Emi ko fẹ ohunkohun lati yipada.
Roads are full at this hour.	Awọn opopona ti kun ni wakati yii.
Any mother will.	Eyikeyi iya yoo.
You are life to me.	Iwọ ni igbesi aye fun mi.
Proceed with it.	Tẹsiwaju pẹlu rẹ.
I do not know.	Emi ko mọ.
I have something great to say to him.	Mo ni ohun nla lati sọ fun u.
Is expected.	Ti wa ni o ti ṣe yẹ.
Please wash your hands.	Jọwọ wẹ ọwọ rẹ.
Almost a year has passed.	O fẹrẹ to ọdun kan ti kọja.
It just hurt him again and again.	O kan ṣe ipalara fun u lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
However he found himself very much in question.	Sibẹsibẹ o ri ara rẹ pupọ ni ibeere.
I have never seen anything beautiful in my life.	Emi ko rii ohunkohun ti o lẹwa ni igbesi aye mi.
Not now or never.	Ko bayi tabi ko lailai.
I did with it.	Mo ti ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
The sister came out again.	Arabinrin naa tun jade.
It will be hard to explain.	O yoo jẹ gidigidi lati ṣe alaye.
But it went wrong.	Sugbon o lọ ti ko tọ.
But this is not an application.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe ohun elo.
Tomorrow you will get the boy.	Ọla o gba ọmọkunrin naa.
Not how often does something happen, but maybe it happens forever.	Kii ṣe iye igba ti nkan kan ṣẹlẹ, ṣugbọn boya o ṣẹlẹ lailai.
The work is pretty much the same too.	Awọn iṣẹ jẹ lẹwa Elo kanna ju.
Nothing to fire on.	Ko si nkankan lati ina lori.
My own eyes because of that.	Oju ti ara mi nitori iyẹn.
His father had thoughts on what to do.	Baba rẹ ni ero lori kini lati ṣe.
There are better ways.	Awọn ọna ti o dara julọ wa.
They have no "no idea" on the matter.	Wọn ko ni "ko si ero" lori ọrọ naa.
She hated to tell him the truth.	O korira lati sọ otitọ fun u.
One on the way.	Ọkan lori ọna.
But, most people learn more than they think.	Ṣugbọn, ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan kọ diẹ sii ju ti wọn ro.
It seemed obvious that they believed something had happened.	O dabi enipe o han gbangba pe wọn gbagbọ pe ohun kan ṣẹlẹ.
Pull out.	Ti fa jade.
We were told you could wash the outside bag.	A sọ fun wa pe o le wẹ apo ita.
The other two did not.	Awọn meji miiran ko ṣe.
That is, one is and.	Iyẹn ni, ọkan ni ati.
They will come to you.	Wọn yoo wa si ọdọ rẹ.
The program works well.	Eto naa ṣiṣẹ daradara.
There were not many people out.	Nibẹ wà ko ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan jade.
Very good.	O dara gaan.
But they found help.	Ṣugbọn wọn ri iranlọwọ.
I just told the truth.	Mo kan sọ otitọ.
Just let me hold the baby.	O kan jẹ ki n mu ọmọ naa.
Higher they could not go.	Ti o ga julọ wọn ko le lọ.
This tea is sweet.	Tii naa dun.
But do not touch them.	Ṣugbọn maṣe fi ọwọ kan wọn.
He raised the back of his hand.	O gbe ẹhin ọwọ rẹ soke.
I just don’t know how to deal with it.	Mo kan ko mọ bi mo ṣe le ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
I need everyone there.	Mo nilo gbogbo eniyan nibẹ.
It would be great to see you.	Yoo jẹ nla lati ri ọ.
Three people were killed there.	Eniyan mẹta ni wọn pa nibẹ.
We know how to do it, but we don’t enjoy it.	A mọ bi a ṣe le ṣe, ṣugbọn a ko gbadun rẹ.
On the back.	Pada pada.
I think my big brothers seem to like it.	Mo ro pe awọn arakunrin mi nla dabi ẹni pe wọn fẹran rẹ.
Some hours probably.	Diẹ ninu awọn wakati jasi.
He is the one who brings everything together.	Oun ni ohun ti o mu ohun gbogbo papọ.
That sounds great.	Iyẹn dun nla.
But when it happens, it hurts a lot.	Ṣugbọn nigbati o ba ṣẹlẹ, o ni ipalara pupọ.
Or the same.	Tabi kanna.
And you get my hands on it.	Ati awọn ti o gba mi ọwọ.
This is where people keep money now.	Eyi ni ibi ti eniyan tọju owo ni bayi.
Just ask questions.	O kan beere awọn ibeere.
He believed in himself.	O gbagbọ ninu ara rẹ.
Other families are the same.	Awọn idile miiran jẹ kanna.
Food is what you need first.	Ounjẹ ni ohun ti o nilo akọkọ.
It was a really beautiful day.	O je kan gan lẹwa ọjọ.
No small house was made for him.	Ko si ile kekere kan ti a ṣe fun u.
That will do.	Ti o yoo ṣe.
I don't look at your shoes.	Emi ko wo bata rẹ.
He seems to like trouble for his own sake.	O dabi ẹni pe o fẹran wahala nitori tirẹ.
He doesn’t want to see you, he said.	Ko fẹ lati ri ọ, o sọ.
Do they have money?	Ṣe wọn ni owo?
Do not pay attention to them.	Maṣe san ọkan si wọn.
They have no children.	Wọn ko ni ọmọ.
That’s just my life to get young people.	Iyẹn nikan ni aye mi lati gba awọn ọdọ.
That should help a lot.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
I have a big family.	Mo ni idile nla kan.
I can feel it, even before it happens.	Mo le lero rẹ, paapaa ṣaaju ki o to ṣẹlẹ.
He did not allow himself to think more than that.	Ko gba ara re laaye lati ronu ju eyi lo.
It was the only way for them.	O jẹ ọna nikan fun wọn.
He was also very scared.	O tun bẹru pupọ.
He stood there, alone.	O duro nibẹ, nikan.
Want more information.	Fẹ alaye diẹ sii.
I do not want that to happen.	Emi ko fẹ ki iyẹn bọ lọwọ.
They do not have many friends.	Wọn ko ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ.
Two hours passed before they left.	Wakati meji ti kọja ṣaaju ki wọn lọ.
We will keep it from here.	A yoo tọju rẹ lati ibi.
He went outside.	O jade lọ si ita.
Have some things you will consider them but a few hours old.	Ni diẹ ninu awọn ohun ti o yoo ro wọn sugbon kan diẹ wakati atijọ.
That was interesting to me.	Ti o je awon si mi.
One day, you can learn how to use them.	Ni ọjọ kan, o le kọ bi a ṣe le lo wọn.
Or not.	Tabi ko dara.
I hate to see it end.	Mo korira lati rii pe o pari.
These light bulbs are very important for our purpose.	Awọn ina ina wọnyi ṣe pataki pupọ fun idi wa.
You may be in a car after a trip.	O le wa ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ lẹhin irin-ajo.
However, everyone makes mistakes.	Sibẹsibẹ, gbogbo eniyan ṣe awọn aṣiṣe.
Learn from her.	Kọ ẹkọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
And there is something behind it.	Ati pe ohun kan wa lẹhin rẹ.
That's easy.	Iyẹn rọrun.
Therefore.	Nitorina.
Or any school days.	Tabi eyikeyi awọn ọjọ ti ile-iwe.
It's beautiful this way.	O lẹwa ni ọna yii.
It can make people smaller.	O le jẹ ki awọn eniyan kere si.
Well, no there is not as a matter of fact.	Daradara, ko si nibẹ ni ko bi ọrọ kan ti o daju.
They need to get you out of here.	Wọn nilo lati mu ọ kuro ni ibi.
There is no help for that.	Ko si iranlọwọ fun iyẹn.
We are leaving tomorrow.	A n lọ ni ọla.
It is time.	O ti wa ni akoko.
This is my favorite book.	Iwe ayanfẹ mi ni eyi.
You have a stressful life.	O ni igbesi aye wahala.
He was already young.	O ti jẹ ọmọde.
I think the idea works.	Mo ro pe ero naa ṣiṣẹ.
They ask you specifically.	Wọn beere fun ọ ni pataki.
This is your life.	Eyi ni igbesi aye rẹ.
At the time we were happy.	Ni akoko ti a wà dun.
You have to understand it.	O ni lati ni oye rẹ.
We need to do better.	A nilo lati ṣe dara julọ.
They will pass these values ​​on to their children.	Wọn yoo fi awọn iye wọnyi si awọn ọmọ wọn.
It makes you laugh.	O mu ki o rẹrin.
This tells us a few things.	Eyi sọ fun wa awọn nkan diẹ.
The eyes will change.	Awọn oju yoo yipada.
He did not know his own strength.	Ko mọ agbara ara rẹ.
More lost children.	Awọn ọmọde ti o padanu diẹ sii.
Even a minute.	Paapaa iṣẹju kan.
Ask yourself if you feel better.	Beere lọwọ ara rẹ ti o ba ni rilara dara.
Very good, in fact.	O dara pupọ, ni otitọ.
I had to find my own.	Mo ti ni lati wa ti ara mi.
Of course we did not back down when we said we would.	Dajudaju a ko pada sẹhin nigba ti a sọ pe a yoo.
The accident caused minor injuries.	Ijamba naa fa awọn ipalara kekere.
Sorry about another night.	Ma binu nipa alẹ miiran.
Or it could be.	Tabi o le jẹ.
It looks amazing to see.	O dabi iyanu lati rii.
Have to play games manually.	Ni lati ṣe awon ere ni ọwọ ka.
Good for now.	O dara fun bayi.
He has lost a father he never knew.	O ti padanu baba ti ko mọ rara.
.	.
If that works for some people, that's fine.	Ti iyẹn ba ṣiṣẹ fun awọn eniyan kan, iyẹn dara julọ.
I would be very angry.	Emi yoo binu pupọ.
The type or location of the object does not matter.	Iru nkan tabi ipo ti nkan naa ko ṣe pataki.
The days are over.	Awọn ọjọ kọja.
That is not true at all.	Iyẹn ko jẹ otitọ rara.
The value should be very small.	Iye yẹ ki o jẹ kekere pupọ.
Maybe it's right.	Boya o tọ.
The woman is a doctor.	Obinrin naa jẹ dokita.
That is information you can use.	Alaye ti o le lo niyẹn.
I drive for several hours.	Mo wakọ fun ọpọlọpọ awọn wakati.
But he did nothing.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe ohunkohun.
Just get it.	O kan gba.
It may not be long.	O le ma pẹ.
It was her last letter to her husband.	O jẹ lẹta ikẹhin rẹ si ọkọ rẹ.
Which does not seem to be an easy task.	Eyi ti ko dabi iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
I can raise this child.	Mo le gbe ọmọ yii dagba.
I'm sure.	Mo daju.
Or maybe they just went out for a walk.	Tabi boya wọn kan jade fun rin.
You have not told me.	O ti ko so fun mi.
It is for young people.	O jẹ fun awọn ọdọ.
But there is no going back.	Ṣugbọn ko si lilọ pada.
His house is near the train station.	Ile rẹ wa nitosi ibudo ọkọ oju irin.
This is not a big surprise.	Eyi kii ṣe iyalẹnu nla.
The most obvious way of love is family love.	Ọna ti o mọ julọ ti ifẹ jẹ ifẹ idile.
And in everyone.	Ati ninu gbogbo eniyan.
We accept this.	A gba eyi.
It was a very hard game.	O jẹ ere lile pupọ.
They should think again.	Wọn yẹ ki o tun ronu lẹẹkansi.
Sun, before and after services only.	Oorun, ṣaaju ati lẹhin awọn iṣẹ nikan.
They do not seem to.	Wọn ko dabi.
He is not a man.	Oun kii ṣe eniyan.
It becomes easier.	O di rọrun.
The train took less than an hour.	Irin naa ko to ju wakati kan lọ.
He took it pretty good.	O si mu o lẹwa ti o dara.
He will not be in this position.	Oun kii yoo wa ni ipo yii.
It was a difficult time.	O jẹ awọn akoko lile.
This is you and me, I give it.	Eyi ni iwọ si mi, emi fun u.
He woke up early in the morning.	O ji ni kutukutu owurọ.
Thirty years is a long time.	Ọgbọn ọdun jẹ igba pipẹ.
This is something you do not want to do.	Eyi jẹ nkan ti o ko fẹ ṣe.
Put everything in bed.	Fi ohun gbogbo si ibusun.
We suspect he was killed.	A fura pe o ti pa.
I was the first in my family to get an understanding.	Emi ni akọkọ ninu ebi mi lati gba oye.
But he did not.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe bẹ.
Everyone will benefit.	Gbogbo eniyan yoo ni anfani.
I read that your child will be late.	Mo ka pe ọmọ rẹ yoo pẹ.
Do not use them.	Maṣe lo wọn.
They happen to be in my house.	Wọn ṣẹlẹ lati wa ni ile mi.
You do not want to give any of this away.	O ko fẹ lati fun eyikeyi ninu eyi kuro.
If we can get it across, we should be fine.	Ti a ba le ṣe rẹ kọja, o yẹ ki a dara.
Think like the others.	Ronu bi awọn miiran.
From you, if possible.	Lati ọdọ rẹ, ti o ba ṣeeṣe.
He did not want to be.	Ko fẹ lati jẹ.
Most people stay here for a drink or a meal.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan duro nibi fun ohun mimu tabi ounjẹ kan.
You will take care of it.	Iwọ yoo tọju rẹ.
We let you do your thing.	A jẹ ki o ṣe ohun rẹ gaan.
I know it's just a matter of time.	Mo mọ pe o jẹ ọrọ kan ti akoko nikan.
Put school work first before anything else.	Fi iṣẹ ile-iwe si akọkọ ṣaaju ohunkohun miiran.
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.	Nigba miiran o ṣiṣẹ ati nigba miiran kii ṣe.
But nothing is easy here.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o rọrun nibi.
There was even a woman who had just given birth.	Paapaa obinrin kan wa ti o ti bi.
I'm dying for a hot book.	Mo n ku fun iwe ti o gbona.
I can not give you anything.	Emi ko le fun ọ ni ohunkohun.
He lost his home, his friends.	O padanu ile rẹ, awọn ọrẹ rẹ.

Can you believe this is the first day of school?	Ṣe o le gbagbọ pe eyi ni ọjọ akọkọ ti ile-iwe?
Working my way back.	Ṣiṣẹ ọna mi pada.
If they don't, that's fine too.	Ti wọn ko ba ṣe bẹ, iyẹn dara paapaa.
You have good days and you have your bad ones.	O ni awọn ọjọ ti o dara ati pe o ni awọn buburu rẹ.
He will not get less than that.	Oun yoo ko gba kere ju iyẹn lọ.
I never saw my sister again after that.	Emi ko ri arabinrin mi lẹẹkansi lẹhin iyẹn.

She wants to meet him.	O fẹ lati pade rẹ.
This work has been mine!	Iṣẹ yii ti jẹ mi!
He did not know that he was.	O ko mọ pe oun ni.
Good if you do not want to talk.	O dara ti o ko ba fẹ sọrọ.
Some good and some bad.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti o dara ati diẹ ninu awọn buburu.
So the phone rang.	Nitorina a gbe foonu naa.
The trip arrived at the venue.	Irin-ajo naa de ibi ipade naa.
I walked into the house.	Mo rin sinu ile.
More holidays should take place.	Awọn ọjọ isinmi diẹ sii yẹ ki o gba.
And that’s pretty much what we try to do.	Ati pe iyẹn lẹwa pupọ ohun ti a gbiyanju lati ṣe.
They are today, they are gone tomorrow.	Wọn wa loni, wọn ti lọ ni ọla.
It can be up for a long time.	O le wa ni oke fun igba pipẹ.
It worked great, for a while out.	O ṣiṣẹ nla, fun igba diẹ jade.
Living around here.	Ti ngbe ni ayika ibi.
This will hurt a little.	Eyi yoo ṣe ipalara diẹ.
As seen in the key application.	Bi a ti rii ninu ohun elo bọtini.
I have never heard of it.	Emi ko tii gbọ ti rẹ.
A sister sat behind him.	Arabinrin kan joko lẹhin rẹ.
No, they told you about the teacher, the person.	Rara, wọn sọ fun ọ nipa olukọ, eniyan naa.
It is not that such places can be considered surprisingly important today.	Kii ṣe pe iru awọn aaye bẹẹ ni a le ro pe iyalẹnu ni pataki loni.
The boys jumped up and down, laughing.	Awọn ọmọkunrin fo si oke ati isalẹ, n rẹrin.
That would be less than an explanation of why he didn’t contact me.	Iyẹn yoo kere ju alaye idi ti ko fi kan si mi.
Now the question is, how?	Bayi ibeere ni, bawo?
I'm very happy.	Inu mi dun pupo.
Soon after breakfast, they left.	Laipẹ lẹhin ounjẹ owurọ, wọn lọ.
I do not need to read anything.	Emi ko nilo lati ka ohunkohun.
I need to hear your voice.	Mo nilo lati gbọ ohun rẹ.

You can do everything else with it, but not like it.	O le ṣe ohun gbogbo miiran pẹlu rẹ, ṣugbọn ko fẹran rẹ.
I do not need this stress in my life.	Emi ko nilo wahala yii ni igbesi aye mi.
I have known him since high times.	Mo ti mọ ọ lati igba ti o ga julọ.
My brother has no real friends, you see.	Arakunrin mi ko ni awọn ọrẹ gaan, o rii.
Just a boy, really.	O kan ọmọkunrin kan, ni otitọ.
We sat on the bed watching them.	A joko lori ibusun ti a n wo wọn.
In the morning it is not the same.	Ni owurọ kii ṣe kanna.
This is their last life.	Eyi ni aye ikẹhin wọn.
Soon it became his life.	Laipẹ o di igbesi aye rẹ.
Well, you met him.	O dara, o pade rẹ.
You have done something similar before.	O ti ṣe iru nkan kan tẹlẹ.
I understand what is happening.	Mo loye ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
At least some of the time.	Ni o kere julọ ti awọn akoko.

Her mother is beautiful.	Iya rẹ lẹwa.
Wait a minute.	Duro ni iṣẹju kan.
I'm glad you stopped.	Inu mi dun pe o duro.
I can't go back.	Emi ko le pada.
In most cases, the cause is unknown.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba, idi naa ko mọ.
I do not get my own phone.	Emi ko gba foonu ti ara mi.
Personal music.	Orin ti ara ẹni.
It is not the best place to hide.	Kii ṣe ibi ti o dara julọ lati tọju.

One person does not accept.	Eniyan kan ko gba.
You have known this for many years.	O ti mọ eyi fun ọdun pupọ.
Most of them, many, many.	Ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn, ọpọlọpọ, ọpọlọpọ.
He doesn't like it.	Ko fẹran rẹ.
He seems to be doing well.	O dabi ẹni pe o n ṣe daradara.
He doesn't like it at all.	Ko feran re rara.
He was sitting on a small tree near my seat.	O joko ni igi kekere kan nitosi aaye ijoko mi.
We look forward to seeing you there.	A n reti lati ri ọ nibẹ.
Show us who you are.	Fi ẹni ti o jẹ han wa.
Nothing, that was enough.	Ko si ohun, ti o wà to.
Other days are easier.	Awọn ọjọ miiran o rọrun.
If it is not true, we do nothing.	Ti ko ba jẹ otitọ, a ko ṣe nkankan.
You need both to work.	O nilo awọn mejeeji lati ṣiṣẹ.
Not that he would.	Kii ṣe pe oun yoo ṣe.
With information on the girl, we no longer need her.	Pẹlu alaye lori ọmọbirin naa, a ko nilo rẹ mọ.
They will not help you.	Wọn kii yoo ran ọ lọwọ.
Both only now.	Awọn mejeeji nikan ni bayi.
Most cities have nightlife.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ilu ni igbesi aye alẹ.
Everyone who came to live with us.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o wa lati gbe pẹlu wa.
That's why we go for the clean kill.	Ti o ni idi ti a lọ fun awọn mọ pa.
I will run your name through it and see if anything changes.	Emi yoo ṣiṣe orukọ rẹ nipasẹ rẹ ati rii boya ohunkohun ba yipada.

Today, my wife's mother.	Loni, iya iyawo mi.
I could not do anything right, by my father.	Emi ko le ṣe ohunkohun ti o tọ, nipasẹ baba mi.
That some of them are men who like men.	Wipe diẹ ninu wọn jẹ awọn ọkunrin ti o fẹran awọn ọkunrin.
People can see, but they will not be able to see it.	Awọn eniyan le wo, ṣugbọn wọn kii yoo ni anfani lati ri i.
It is an appropriate name.	O jẹ orukọ ti o yẹ.
I want to see him at work.	Mo fẹ lati ri i ni ibi iṣẹ.

It came around after two weeks.	O wa ni ayika lẹhin ọsẹ meji.

Some have trouble waking up.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni wahala lati ji.
Now as sweet as the day has long.	Bayi bi dun bi ọjọ ti gun.
The foot is.	Ẹsẹ jẹ.
That means something.	Iyẹn ni lati tumọ nkankan.
I will always watch them.	Emi yoo ma wo wọn.
Three more of them also slept.	Mẹta diẹ sii ninu wọn tun tun sun.
A bad future or not, it is the future.	Ojo iwaju buburu tabi rara, o jẹ ọjọ iwaju.
The world is beautiful.	Aye jẹ lẹwa.
They think.	Won ro.
You can pull up.	O le fa soke.
They have already made an agreement.	Wọn ti kọja ṣe adehun kan.
The thing is because there can be no other way.	Ohun ti o wa nitori ko le jẹ ọna miiran.
And, but this is something else.	Ati, ṣugbọn eyi ni nkan miiran.
The city knows.	Ilu naa mọ.
The new way of life will only work in cities.	Awọn ọna igbesi aye tuntun yoo ṣiṣẹ nikan ni awọn ilu.
It’s a feeling of something inanimate.	O jẹ rilara ti nkan ti ko ni aye.
It made a good point.	O ṣe aaye ti o dara.
That is my opinion of good education.	Iyẹn ni imọran mi ti ẹkọ to dara.
One way out, he said.	Ọna kan jade, o sọ.
But he never told you the truth.	Ṣugbọn ko sọ otitọ fun ọ rara.
The sea is full of water.	Okun ti kun fun omi.
The unit was very clean.	Kuro wà gan o mọ.
I get up and move on.	Mo dide ki o tẹsiwaju sẹhin.
Now you are convinced.	Bayi o ni idaniloju.
Once it starts nothing will stop it.	Ni kete ti o bẹrẹ ko si ohun ti yoo da a duro.
So tired .	O ti rẹ .
But it also elevated my priorities.	Ṣugbọn o tun mu awọn ohun pataki mi ga.
It was not an off chance.	O je ko ohun pa anfani.
No, you just want to see.	Rara, o kan fẹ lati wo.
Her parents had to say everything.	Awọn obi rẹ ni lati sọ ohun gbogbo.

He never lost a game in his career.	Ko padanu ere kan ninu iṣẹ rẹ.
Neither can, but he wants to.	Bẹni ko le, ṣugbọn o fẹ lati.
You can build a program or a project.	O le kọ eto tabi iṣẹ kan.
Test early.	Ṣe idanwo ni kutukutu.
But my promise still stands.	Ṣugbọn ileri mi ṣi duro.
In fact, it is thought and power.	Ni otitọ, o jẹ ero ati agbara.
Whatever happens, they know.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ, wọn mọ.
That means you can’t get it your own way.	Eyi tumọ si pe o ko le gba ni ọna tirẹ.
It is over.	O ti kọja.
He was not afraid at all, not even from a young age.	Ko bẹru rara, kii ṣe lati igba ti o jẹ ọmọde kekere.
We just have to come.	A kan ni lati wa.
About a lot of things.	Nipa ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.

There are no errors there.	Ko si awọn aṣiṣe nibẹ.
Let them think they are with the idea itself.	Jẹ ki wọn ro pe wọn wa pẹlu imọran funrararẹ.
Some words have power and for me, that does.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọrọ kan ni agbara ati fun mi, iyẹn ṣe.
Bad things will happen if you do not stop.	Ohun buburu yoo ṣẹlẹ ti o ko ba da.
Everything is new and in excellent condition.	Ohun gbogbo jẹ tuntun ati ni ipo ti o dara julọ.
There is a certain amount of time to money.	Iye akoko kan wa si owo.
They always leave you because they have to.	Nigbagbogbo wọn fi ọ silẹ nitori wọn ni lati.

You can get as we get.	O le gba bi a ti gba.
Learn what parents can do.	Kọ ẹkọ ohun ti awọn obi le ṣe.
My body has become my own again.	Ara mi ti di ti ara mi lẹẹkansi.
However this time it is happening to me.	Sibẹsibẹ ni akoko yii o n ṣẹlẹ si mi.
The growing tree was a wedding gift for the boy.	Igi ti o dagba jẹ ẹbun igbeyawo fun ọmọkunrin naa.
Like me, they are there to hear important news.	Bii emi, wọn wa nibẹ lati gbọ awọn iroyin pataki.
But it can not.	Sugbon ko le.
But we cannot come yet.	Ṣugbọn a ko le wa sibẹsibẹ.
It is nothing new.	Kii ṣe nkan tuntun.
It makes me very happy.	O mu mi dun pupọ.
Not enough to take a picture.	Ko to lati ya aworan kan.
At the same time, a little something is also said, good that way.	Ni akoko kanna, ohun kekere kan tun sọ pe, dara ni ọna yẹn.
He missed the opportunity to become a doctor.	O ti padanu anfani lati di dokita.
The more you can do, the more benefits you have.	Awọn diẹ ti o le se, awọn diẹ anfani ti o ni.
It works this time.	O ṣiṣẹ ni akoko yii.
Please stand back as much as you can, please.	Jọwọ duro sẹhin bi o ti le ṣe, jọwọ.
Everything else is simple.	Ohun gbogbo miiran rọrun.
We hope you enjoy working with us !.	A nireti pe o gbadun ṣiṣẹ pẹlu wa!.
It does not force anything on us that we do not want.	Ko fi agbara mu ohunkohun lori wa ti a ko fẹ.
And why not ask him for lunch.	Ati kilode ti o ko beere lọwọ rẹ fun ounjẹ ọsan.
The whole house has a front door.	Gbogbo ile ni ilẹkun iwaju.

Everything was fine for about an hour.	Ohun gbogbo ti dara fun bii wakati kan.
And that becomes the winning face.	Ati pe iyẹn di oju ti o gba.
And not too often.	Ati ki o ko ju igba.
He does not worry about it.	Ko ṣe aniyan nipa rẹ.
First there are obvious ways.	Ni akọkọ awọn ọna ti o han gbangba wa.

For one, it was his father’s house.	Fun ọkan, o jẹ ile baba rẹ.

Your life is not worth that.	Igbesi aye rẹ ko tọ si iyẹn.

He wanted to hear but could not really, not to the whole story.	O fẹ lati gbọ ṣugbọn ko le gaan, kii ṣe si gbogbo itan.
I also like their names.	Mo tun fẹ awọn orukọ wọn.
It is hard to see.	O jẹ gidigidi lati ri.
You know how this will end.	O mọ bi eyi yoo ṣe pari.
In many ways.	Ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna.
But, you know ,.	Ṣugbọn, o mọ,.
Love there is not any reason.	Ni ife nibẹ ni ko eyikeyi idi.
I think they will end the meeting.	Mo ro pe wọn yoo pari ipade.
I enjoyed it of course.	Mo ti gbadun rẹ dajudaju.
Both return to the table.	Awọn mejeeji pada si tabili.
The time has come.	Akoko ti de.

And so do your children.	Ati bẹ awọn ọmọ rẹ.
I need to do what is best for my family and for myself.	Mo nilo lati ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ fun idile mi ati fun ara mi.

His wife loves life.	Iyawo re feran aye.
Keep a lot of and out of sight.	Pa pupo ati ki o jade ti oju.
However, you do not see any of that.	Sibẹsibẹ, iwọ ko rii ọkan ninu iyẹn.
At first, we did not like it very much.	Ni akọkọ, a ko fẹran rẹ daradara.
Of any kind whatever.	Ti eyikeyi iru ohunkohun ti.

We noticed our mistake after it was too late.	A ṣe akiyesi aṣiṣe wa lẹhin ti o ti pẹ ju.
You know that this city has changed a lot.	O mọ pe ilu yii ti yipada pupọ.
They understand the process.	Wọn loye ọna naa.
They did not let me go.	Wọn ko jẹ ki n lọ.
I think we will use your car.	Mo ro pe a yoo lo ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ.
No, no, no.	Rara, rara, rara.
Every child on earth deserves a proper education.	Gbogbo ọmọ lori ile aye wa yẹ ẹkọ ti o tọ.
It will grow out of it.	Yoo dagba lati inu rẹ.
Legal advice is an idea, not a reality.	Imọran ofin jẹ ero, kii ṣe otitọ.
But little ones do not understand that.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọmọ kekere ko ni oye iyẹn.
He will stay here for two weeks.	Oun yoo duro nibi fun ọsẹ meji.
You are in the car.	Iwọ ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.

They did a great job.	Wọn ṣe iṣẹ nla kan.
This is very true.	Eyi jẹ otitọ julọ.
But no, it is.	Sugbon rara, o wa.
Maybe keep them to do to see you.	Boya pa wọn mọ lati ṣe lati rii si ọ.
In the end, everyone makes their own decisions.	Ni ipari, gbogbo eniyan n ṣe awọn ipinnu ti ara wọn.
Things in the house.	Awọn nkan ti o wa ninu ile.
They could not have been.	Wọn ko le ti wa.
He can not get without it.	Ko le gba laisi rẹ.
Work as naturally as possible.	Ṣiṣẹ bi nipa ti ara bi o ti ṣee.
To pull a driver.	Lati fa awakọ.
He decided to complete this project.	O pinnu lati pari iṣẹ yii.
You just can’t leave them.	O kan ko le fi wọn silẹ.
Of course, it can happen, and we do not notice.	Dajudaju, o le ṣẹlẹ, ati pe a ko ṣe akiyesi.
In front of people.	Ni iwaju eniyan.
I'll take your room.	Emi yoo gba yara rẹ.
No one is interested in doing this work.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o nifẹ lati ṣe iṣẹ yii.
He speaks when he should not.	O sọrọ nigbati o ko yẹ.
Another mistake.	Aṣiṣe miiran.
You wonder if it might be that person.	O ro boya o le jẹ wipe eniyan.
They were born many children.	Wọn bi ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde.
So he came out.	Nitorina o jade.
That will work for me.	Iyẹn yoo ṣiṣẹ fun mi.
We have to remember this program.	A ni lati ranti eto yii.
The situation is similar now.	Ipo naa dabi iru kanna bayi.
We are here together as a mother and daughter.	A wa nibi papọ bi iya ati ọmọbirin.
Raise your hand to the bar.	Gbe ọwọ rẹ soke si igi.
Her body is very nice.	Ara rẹ dara pupọ.
He heard the word.	O gbọ ọrọ naa.
They look at each other.	Wọn wo ara wọn.
It is best to talk to them.	O dara julọ lati ba wọn sọrọ.
I will never turn to my brother.	Emi kii yoo yipada si arakunrin mi lailai.
How much money do you have on it?	Elo ni owo ti o ni lori rẹ?
Everything is the same everywhere.	Gbogbo nkan jẹ kanna nibi gbogbo.
But, again, there was a possible explanation.	Sugbon, lẹẹkansi, nibẹ je kan ṣee ṣe alaye.
I will not go.	Emi ko ni lọ.
I hope you understand and know this.	Mo nireti pe o loye ati mọ eyi.
The facts are quite clear.	Awọn otitọ jẹ ohun ko o.
I heard you talk about the news of the day.	Mo gbọ ti o sọ nipa awọn iroyin ọjọ.
One you might like.	Ọkan ti o le fẹ.
Another brother who seems to have the time of his life.	Arakunrin miiran ti o dabi pe o ni akoko igbesi aye rẹ.
Same thing if you have small children.	Ohun kanna ti o ba ni awọn ọmọde kekere.
You can help us with a small donation.	O le ṣe iranlọwọ fun wa nipasẹ ẹbun kekere kan.
They made every mistake they could make.	Wọn ṣe gbogbo aṣiṣe ti wọn le ṣe.

It just gives you more room to work.	O kan fun ọ ni yara diẹ sii lati ṣiṣẹ.
We had a great time and everyone was very happy.	A ni akoko nla ati pe gbogbo eniyan dun pupọ.
You can even take a day off tomorrow.	O le paapaa gba isinmi ọjọ kan ni ọla.
Many are hurt by it.	Ọpọlọpọ ni o ni ipalara nipasẹ rẹ.
Repeat the books.	Tun awọn iwe.
It is too late for them.	O ti pẹ fun wọn.
And they both knew they couldn’t stay here.	Ati pe awọn mejeeji mọ pe wọn ko le duro nibi.
He knew they had an incredible understanding.	O mọ pe wọn ni oye ti iyalẹnu.
It also looks like the future.	O tun dabi ojo iwaju.
Thinking about the matter for a while.	Ti n ronu nipa ọrọ naa fun igba diẹ.
Or your name, at least.	Tabi orukọ rẹ, o kere ju.
There are several reasons why some games do not make the cut.	Nibẹ ni o wa ni ọpọlọpọ awọn idi idi ti diẹ ninu awọn ere ko ṣe awọn ge.
Now, of course, we know better.	Bayi, dajudaju, a mọ dara julọ.
This is just an evil move.	Eleyi jẹ o kan ohun ibi Gbe.
Maybe that makes sense to someone.	Boya iyẹn jẹ oye si ẹnikan.
I want to live here forever.	Mo fe gbe nibi lailai.
But this can happen.	Ṣugbọn eyi le ṣẹlẹ.
It does not ask whether it is good.	O ko ni beere boya o dara.
Come spend some time with me.	Wa lo akoko diẹ pẹlu mi.
But it is more.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ diẹ sii.
There is something that stands for him.	Nibẹ ni ohun ti o duro fun u.
If it's not your thing, just say so.	Ti kii ba ṣe nkan tirẹ, o dara kan sọ bẹ.
Prices have risen.	Iye owo tii dide.

What you say, the way you put things.	Ohun ti o sọ, ọna ti o fi awọn nkan ṣe.

She turned her face to the object.	O yi oju rẹ pada si nkan naa.

They have to be better than they are.	Wọn ni lati dara ju ti wọn lọ.

We are waiting for more work.	A n duro de iṣẹ diẹ.
I work on my weekends.	Mo ṣiṣẹ ni awọn ọjọ isinmi mi.
Regarding children, what happens to them.	Nipa awọn ọmọde, kini o ṣẹlẹ si wọn.
You want them to feel good about themselves.	O fẹ ki wọn lero ti o dara nipa ara wọn.
We should do the same.	A yẹ ki o ṣe kanna.
He is not one of us.	Oun kii ṣe ọkan ninu wa.
There is no room.	Ko si yara.
I did not recognize him from the front.	Emi ko da a mọ lati iwaju.
He met me on the road.	O pade mi ni opopona.
I didn’t take long, either.	Emi ko gba gun, boya.
He did a great job of that this summer.	O ṣe iṣẹ nla ti iyẹn ni igba ooru yii.
You will have to work every day.	Iwọ yoo ni lati ṣiṣẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Maybe it will change something up for me.	Boya o yoo yi nkankan soke fun mi.
Things grew up.	Awọn ohun dagba soke.
Do you have any suggestions ?.	Ṣe o ni awọn imọran eyikeyi?.
For them, that means cars.	Fun wọn, iyẹn tumọ si awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
There is a time for all of us.	Akoko wa fun gbogbo wa.
Now, we can see what works and what doesn’t.	Ni bayi, a le rii ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ ati ohun ti ko ṣiṣẹ.
Someone should start asking questions.	Ẹnikan yẹ ki o bẹrẹ beere ibeere.
The hour has come to get to you.	Wakati naa ti ni lati dide si ọdọ rẹ.
We do not know how or why.	A ko mọ bii tabi idi.
He is not like that.	Oun ko ri bẹẹ.
I'll drop things off.	Emi yoo ju awọn nkan silẹ.
However one way.	Sibẹsibẹ ọna kan.
And they are the work of the same people.	Ati pe wọn jẹ iṣẹ ti awọn eniyan kanna.
That's how you do it.	Bi o ṣe le ṣe niyẹn.
Let me wash you.	Jẹ ki n fo ọ.
However he never spoke to me again.	Sibẹsibẹ ko tun ba mi sọrọ rara.
What men have to work with is good.	Ohun ti awọn ọkunrin ni lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu dara.
I wore it at our wedding.	Mo wọ o ni igbeyawo wa.
So, whatever you do.	Nitorina, ohunkohun ti o ṣe.
Both are wrong.	Awọn mejeeji jẹ aṣiṣe.
You will have a great day tomorrow.	Iwọ yoo ni ọjọ nla ni ọla.
It has other artistic advantages.	O ni awọn anfani iṣẹ ọna miiran.
Without water, life is impossible	Laisi omi, aye ko ṣee ṣe
There is nothing to do about it.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣe nipa rẹ.
I think you feel the same way.	Mo ro pe o lero ni ọna kanna.
If we wait, it will be too late.	Ti a ba duro, yoo pẹ ju.
I need a few hours not to panic.	Mo nilo awọn wakati diẹ lati ma bẹru.
I'm afraid you do not understand.	Mo bẹru pe o ko loye.

Until last night.	Titi di alẹ kẹhin.
And this does not contain those letters.	Ati pe eyi ko ni awọn lẹta yẹn.
We have to have a reason.	A ni lati ni idi kan.
You can't laugh at it.	O ko le rẹrin ni.
And it can be.	Ati pe o le jẹ.
That's good.	Iyẹn dara.
Give yourself a break.	Fun ara rẹ ni isinmi.
I get a lot of football as they will let me.	Mo gba bọọlu pupọ bi wọn yoo jẹ ki mi.
Simple, just happy that it was called.	Rọrun, o kan dun pe o ti pe.
If your friend needs to talk about it, he will talk about it.	Ti ọrẹ rẹ ba nilo lati sọrọ nipa rẹ, yoo sọ nipa rẹ.
He did not run them.	Ko ṣiṣe wọn.
He wants to get it back.	O fe gba pada.
There was some water there but it was broken.	Omi kan wa nibẹ paapaa ṣugbọn o ti fọ.
You will get the job again.	Iwọ yoo tun gba iṣẹ lẹẹkansi.
We try to treat everyone with respect and love.	A gbiyanju lati tọju gbogbo eniyan pẹlu ọwọ ati ifẹ.
I should help with that.	Mo yẹ ki o ṣe iranlọwọ pẹlu iyẹn.
Maybe you should try something else.	Boya o yẹ ki o gbiyanju nkan miiran.
I grew up before my brother did.	Mo ti dagba ṣaaju ki arakunrin mi to ṣe.
It's full of money.	O kun fun owo.
So he decided he must have a bad one.	Nitorina o pinnu pe o gbọdọ ni ọkan buburu.
Look around at this board.	Wo ni ayika ni yi ọkọ.
I'm very happy.	Inu mi dun pupo.
We are losing sight of them now.	A ti n padanu oju wọn bayi.
Most of your people don’t.	Pupọ julọ awọn eniyan rẹ ko ni.
We will see about that.	A yoo rii nipa iyẹn.
The water was high that night.	Omi naa ga ni alẹ yẹn.
I don't want to be friends with him.	Emi ko fẹ lati jẹ ọrẹ pẹlu rẹ.
So we will lose the house.	Nitorina a yoo padanu ile naa.
It can change.	O le yipada.
Male and female students are very friendly.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ọkunrin ati obinrin jẹ ọrẹ pupọ.
Your own way.	Ọna ti ara rẹ.
After this talk is over.	Lẹhin ti ọrọ yii ti pari.
But it did me.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe mi.
Less water in winter.	Omi kere si ni igba otutu.
We came to see in many places.	A wa lati rii ni ọpọlọpọ awọn aaye.
Little has changed.	Kekere ti yipada.
I am thinking of getting a job here.	Mo n ronu lati gba iṣẹ kan nibi.
You want to lose your daughter.	O fẹ padanu ọmọbirin rẹ.
Renovate your home every few years.	Tun ile rẹ ṣe ni gbogbo ọdun diẹ.
We start at night.	A bẹrẹ ni alẹ.
But, and so on.	Ṣugbọn, ati nitorina.
They have not seen him yet.	Wọn ko tii ri i.
That could change.	Iyẹn le yipada.
I can't get enough.	Emi ko le gba to.
His wife, he loved her.	Iyawo re, o feran re.
I do not know when it comes out.	Emi ko mọ nigbati o ba jade.
Maybe not.	Boya ko ṣe bẹ.
If you say so.	Ti o ba sọ bẹ.
Will probably come back to get a lot more.	Yoo jasi pada lati gba pupọ diẹ sii.
Everyone will want to do more.	Gbogbo eniyan yoo fẹ lati ṣe diẹ sii.
However, that is not an agreement.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn ko jẹ adehun.
So make one and make it happy.	Nitorina o se ọkan ki o jẹ ki o dun.
He also began to look like his old man.	O tun bẹrẹ lati dabi ẹni atijọ rẹ.
But, life or not, it doesn’t matter.	Ṣugbọn, aye tabi rara, ko ṣe pataki.
As you can see, there is something for everyone !.	Bi o ti le ri, nibẹ ni nkankan fun gbogbo eniyan !.
The sister was convinced.	Arabinrin naa ni idaniloju.
He kept his money in his shoes.	O pa owo rẹ mọ ni bata rẹ.
I have never seen one before.	Emi ko tii ri ọkan tẹlẹ.
Sorry it didn't work, he said.	Ma binu pe ko ṣiṣẹ, o sọ.
Most people do not even want to know his name.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ko paapaa fẹ lati mọ orukọ rẹ.
For many winters he continued to learn.	Fun ọpọlọpọ awọn igba otutu o tẹsiwaju lati kọ ẹkọ.
I know what time it is.	Mo mọ ohun ti akoko ti o jẹ.
Things happen as they happen.	Awọn nkan n ṣẹlẹ bi wọn ṣe ṣẹlẹ.
Love yourself first.	Nifẹ ara rẹ akọkọ.
Every single game is as important as any other.	Gbogbo ere kan jẹ pataki bi eyikeyi miiran.
He was the highest in his class.	O jẹ ẹniti o ga julọ ni kilasi rẹ.
The service is calling.	Iṣẹ naa n pe.
Maybe that will change.	Boya iyẹn yoo yipada.
The more you learn, the more you need to learn.	Bi o ṣe n kọ ẹkọ diẹ sii, diẹ sii o nilo lati kọ ẹkọ.
But you know nothing about men in clothing, at least.	Ṣugbọn o mọ nkankan nipa awọn ọkunrin ni aṣọ, ni o kere.
They should speak up.	Wọn yẹ ki o sọrọ soke.
But the facts are there.	Ṣugbọn awọn otitọ wa nibẹ.
And that's it now.	Ati pe iyẹn ni bayi.
I have.	Mo ti ni.
I would like to have a daughter.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ni ọmọbirin kan.
It also makes it very easy to cut.	O tun jẹ ki o rọrun pupọ lati ge.
I can't understand why behind it.	Emi ko le loye idi ti o wa lẹhin rẹ.
My dogs ate under the table.	Awọn aja mi jẹun labẹ tabili.
Not without the man.	Kii ṣe laisi ọkunrin naa.
I must complete this report in the afternoon.	Mo gbọdọ pari iroyin yii ni ọsan.
He is on police force.	O wa lori agbara ọlọpa.
That is very obvious.	Iyẹn han pupọ.
You see cars passing by.	O wo awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o kọja ni ọna.
A sense of lost interest.	A ori ti padanu anfani.
They even asked for.	Wọn beere paapaa fun.
Bad words need to be considered.	Awọn ọrọ buburu nilo lati ṣe akiyesi.
There is nothing wrong with it.	Ko si ohun ti ko tọ si pẹlu rẹ.
A month ago, better yet.	Oṣu kan sẹhin, dara julọ sibẹsibẹ.
I don't want it to end.	Emi ko fẹ ki o pari.
We were there for a few hours.	A wa nibẹ fun awọn wakati diẹ.
It was obviously a time of trouble for them.	O han ni akoko ipalara fun wọn.
Some kind of.	Iru diẹ ninu.
I need help.	Mo nilo iranlọwọ.
Things start to understand as soon as they are alive.	Awọn nkan bẹrẹ ni oye ni kete ti wọn ba wa laaye.
I learned this at an early age.	Mo ti kọ eyi ni ọjọ ori.
Blow out.	Fẹ jade.
These are the two things that go together.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn nkan meji ti o lọ papọ.
You know it's beautiful.	O mọ pe o lẹwa.
I don’t see what happened after that.	Emi ko rii ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ lẹhin iyẹn.
It is a hard lesson to learn sometimes.	O jẹ ẹkọ lile lati kọ ẹkọ nigba miiran.
Do go for a great meeting.	Ṣe lọ pade nla kan.
It was a drop.	O je kan silẹ.
I know really bad things can happen to me because they have.	Mo mọ gan buburu ohun le ṣẹlẹ si mi nitori won ni.
We have a lot of stuff.	A ni ọna pupọ nkan.
He is not young.	Oun kii ṣe ọdọ.
He leaned on his back.	O fi ara le ẹhin rẹ.
I can't find any of my family.	Emi ko le ri eyikeyi wa ti idile mi.
Now it stands still.	Bayi o duro patapata.
Close your eyes,.	Di oju rẹ, .
Not pretty.	Ko lẹwa.
You don’t have to, anymore.	O ko ni lati, mọ.
We hope that will work soon.	A nireti pe iyẹn yoo ṣiṣẹ laipẹ.
That is not what it means.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti o tumọ si.
None of this is new.	Ko si ọkan ninu eyi jẹ tuntun.
That's how it goes.	Bi o ṣe n lọ niyẹn.
It should be thoroughly washed before entering the river.	O yẹ ki o wẹ daradara ki o to wọ inu odo naa.
You can have on their terms.	O le ni lori awọn ofin wọn.
The facts we have.	Awọn otitọ ti a ni.
Now is the time to go outside and enjoy the weather.	Bayi ni akoko lati jade ni ita ati gbadun oju ojo.
That's why you're up here only.	Ti o ni idi ti o ba soke nibi nikan.
We need to improve here.	A nilo lati mu dara dara nibi.
The story ends at this point.	Itan naa pari ni aaye yii.
They need their families and friends.	Wọn nilo awọn idile ati awọn ọrẹ wọn.
Now, keep them.	Bayi, pa wọn mọ.
It's very sweet.	O dun gan.
Sometimes the two are seen together.	Nigba miiran awọn mejeeji ni a rii papọ.
I just don’t want to see them again.	Mo kan ko fẹ lati ri wọn lẹẹkansi.
The first class consists of two students.	Kilasi akọkọ ni awọn ọmọ ile-iwe meji.
But they let it work.	Ṣugbọn wọn jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
I think you want to continue.	Mo ro pe o fẹ lati tẹsiwaju.
They can’t hear yours, either.	Wọn ko le gbọ tirẹ, boya.
A family always has more than three children.	Idile kan nigbagbogbo ni diẹ sii ju ọmọ mẹta lọ.
I think we played together.	Mo ro pe a dun papọ.
Unsure of that front.	Ti ko ni idaniloju ni iwaju yẹn.
I received three new teachers this year.	Mo gba awọn olukọ tuntun mẹta ni ọdun yii.
Most members are friends.	Pupọ julọ awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ jẹ ọrẹ.
We have to go home.	A ni lati lọ si ile.
I'll get back to you.	Emi yoo pada si ọdọ rẹ.
You want to ask them.	O fẹ lati beere lọwọ wọn.
However, this method can cause some minor errors.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọna yii le fa awọn aṣiṣe kekere kan.
The river cannot stand forever.	Odo ko le duro lailai.
I know you need me.	Mo mọ pe o nilo mi.
And it continues to grow.	Ati pe o tẹsiwaju lati dagba.
Much of the area is under water.	Pupọ agbegbe naa wa labẹ omi.
I have to sleep.	Mo gbọdọ sun.
This is the job you want.	Eyi ni iṣẹ ti o fẹ.
Nothing is moving.	Ko si ohun ti n gbe.
Nothing in, nothing out.	Ko si nkankan ninu, ko si nkan jade.
All this works well.	Gbogbo eyi ṣiṣẹ daradara.
I will go with the boy, if he is mine.	Emi yoo ba ọmọkunrin naa lọ, ti o ba jẹ ti emi.
You don’t ask parents.	O ko beere awọn obi.
It is time for celebration.	O jẹ akoko fun ayẹyẹ.
And to have someone there to tell you that.	Ati lati ni ẹnikan nibẹ lati so fun o pe.
And you should change the water every day.	Ati pe o yẹ ki o yi omi pada ni gbogbo ọjọ.
They give it.	Wọn fun o.
Dad didn’t know what he could do to help.	Baba ko mọ ohun ti o le ṣe lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
O man up.	Iwọ eniyan soke.
But that can be.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn le.
It says it makes you feel more human.	O sọ pe o jẹ ki o ni rilara eniyan diẹ sii.
There is no requirement for us to be outside.	Ko si ibeere fun wa lati wa ni ita.
There has been this to do.	Nibẹ ti ti yi lati ṣe.
I haven’t been around you enough to know.	Emi ko ti ni ayika rẹ to lati mọ.
We do not know who they are, or where they come from.	A ko mọ awọn ti wọn jẹ, tabi ibi ti wọn ti wa.
For a while, it was there, still as a game.	Fun igba diẹ, o wa nibẹ, ṣi bi ere.
Nothing to say.	Ko si ohun ti o le sọ.
Many agree by that.	Ọpọlọpọ gba nipasẹ iyẹn.
It was not a big question for him to make in himself.	Kii ṣe ibeere nla fun u lati ṣe ninu ararẹ.
It may even be early.	O le paapaa ni kutukutu.
Someone killed him, even.	Ẹnikan ti pa a, paapaa.
You have to have the power of both art methods.	O ni lati ni agbara ti awọn ọna aworan mejeeji.
No woman will read it.	Ko si obinrin yoo ka o.
I am, you know.	Emi ni, o mọ.
Very good for him.	O dara pupọ fun u.
She waited for him to say something.	O duro fun u lati sọ nkankan.
Her parents are machines.	Awọn obi rẹ jẹ awọn ẹrọ.
There are things you don’t get around to do.	Awọn ohun kan wa ti o ko gba ni ayika lati ṣe.
We make good money now.	A ṣe owo ti o dara ni bayi.
There are many towers here.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile giga wa nibi.
Do whatever is possible.	Ṣe ohunkohun ti o ṣee ṣe.
Give a person a day.	Fun eniyan fun ọjọ kan.
You will see the old as well, as it were.	Iwọ yoo rii atijọ paapaa, bi o ti jẹ.
It will be one of the years.	O yoo jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọdun.
He said he had to leave.	O sọ pe o ni lati lọ kuro.
I always say.	Mo nigbagbogbo sọ.
I got out of my shoes.	Mo jade kuro ninu bata mi.
There are many restaurants nearby too.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile ounjẹ wa nitosi paapaa.
You have a gift.	O ni ẹbun kan.
We cannot or will not observe.	A ko le jẹ tabi yoo ṣe akiyesi.
Money does not grow on trees.	Owo ko dagba lori igi.
I picked it up again.	Mo tun gbe e soke.
I am sure it will make me better.	Mo dajudaju pe yoo ṣe mi dara.
I love them, they love me, love at first sight.	Mo fẹran wọn, wọn fẹran mi, ifẹ ni oju akọkọ.
Now, we have it.	Bayi, a ni o.
We have to.	A ni lati.
It turned out he wanted to talk to me but I went.	O wa jade o fẹ lati ba mi sọrọ ṣugbọn mo lọ.
Now, let me help you.	Bayi, jẹ ki n ran ọ lọwọ.
It just gets to play out that way.	O kan n ni lati mu jade ni ọna yẹn.
But time is running out.	Ṣugbọn akoko ti n lọ.
In fact, we are not.	Ni otitọ, a ko wa.
Leave for an hour.	Fi silẹ fun wakati kan.
I'm just getting started.	Mo n kan bẹrẹ.
This does not help.	Eyi ko ṣe iranlọwọ.
Just think about today.	Kan ronu nipa loni.
However, it remains profitable.	Sibẹsibẹ, o duro ni ere.
They decided to do something about the problem.	Wọn pinnu lati ṣe nkan kan nipa iṣoro naa.
However, there is no one to be here.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko si ọkan lati wa nibi.
That’s good by me.	Iyẹn dara nipasẹ mi.
He did not.	Ko ṣe e.
He said nothing.	Ko so nkankan.
Some people do not know it.	Awọn eniyan kan ko mọ ọ.
You do not get up.	O ko ba dide.
Can't put it down.	Ko le fi si isalẹ.
He doesn’t know any better.	Ko mọ eyikeyi dara julọ.
The girl is small for her age.	Ọmọbirin naa jẹ kekere fun ọjọ ori rẹ.
By my own mistake.	Nipasẹ aṣiṣe ti ara mi.
Maybe that’s what we’re seeing.	Boya ohun ti a n rii niyẹn.
I wonder when this will happen.	Mo Iyanu nigbati eyi yoo ṣẹlẹ.
He did not die but went down for a while.	Ko ku ṣugbọn o lọ silẹ ni igba diẹ.
They left early for the game.	Wọn ti lọ ni kutukutu fun ere naa.
At least that was something.	Ni o kere ti o wà nkankan.
What a question.	Kini ibeere.
He told me he knew that.	O sọ fun mi pe o mọ iyẹn.
But there are situations where you have to get married.	Ṣugbọn awọn ipo wa bii o ni lati ṣe igbeyawo.
The situation is also amazing.	Ipo naa tun jẹ iyanu.
I got on.	Mo ni lori.
I have good days and bad days.	Mo ni awọn ọjọ ti o dara ati awọn ọjọ buburu.
But it was a nice flight.	Sugbon o je kan dara ofurufu.
He will use that.	Oun yoo lo iyẹn.
But nothing was done.	Sugbon ko si ohun ti a ṣe.
They don’t just ask people who their favorite team is.	Wọn ko kan beere lọwọ eniyan ti ẹgbẹ ayanfẹ wọn jẹ.
We will become.	A yoo di.
For his mother, for his sister.	Fun iya rẹ, fun arabinrin rẹ.
The soil should be warm in winter.	Ile yẹ ki o gbona ni igba otutu.
We’ve started these and they are amazing.	A ti bẹrẹ awọn wọnyi ati pe wọn jẹ iyalẹnu.
It may take some time to do this.	O le gba igba diẹ lati ṣiṣẹ eyi.
Go where you want to go.	Lọ si ibi ti o fẹ ki o lọ.
Now put me to my rest.	Bayi fi mi si isinmi mi.
A family has been evicted.	A ti le idile kan jade.
The food is working.	Ounjẹ naa n ṣiṣẹ.
You can write on all that.	O le kọ lori gbogbo iyẹn.
Which can be bad.	Eyi ti o le jẹ buburu.
They entered the room.	Wọn wọ yara naa.
And it doesn’t contact me anymore.	Ati pe ko ni kan si mi mọ.
Even the baby.	Paapaa ọmọ naa.
I have a button.	Mo ni bọtini kan.
It does not matter.	Ko ṣe ohun.
He said nothing.	Ko so nkankan.
I'm here.	Mo wa nibi.
And one fast.	Ati ọkan ti o yara.
Put it there.	Gbe e wa nibẹ.
But many of us cannot do that.	Ṣugbọn ọpọlọpọ wa ko le ṣe bẹ.
That pulled us both.	Ti fa wa mejeeji.
Everything changed and everything ended.	Ohun gbogbo yipada ati ohun gbogbo pari.
And how many.	Ati melo ni.
I have done that for me more than for any other reason.	Mo ti ṣe iyẹn fun mi diẹ sii ju fun eyikeyi idi miiran.
The man refused, and went to the side.	Ọkunrin naa kọ, o si lọ si ẹgbẹ.
If you have, you can ask yourself.	Ti o ba ni, o le beere lọwọ rẹ funrararẹ.
There was very little they could do.	Nibẹ wà gan kekere ti won le se.
I never met his mother.	Emi ko pade iya rẹ rara.
It will be me and my daughter.	Yoo jẹ emi ati ọmọbirin mi.
You can come with me if you want.	O le wa pẹlu mi ti o ba fẹ.
It was late at night.	O je pẹ alẹ.
But you should not take both back.	Ṣugbọn ko yẹ ki o gba awọn mejeeji pada.
Very happy with it.	Inu pupọ pẹlu rẹ.
I do not want to return to my place.	Emi ko fẹ lati pada si aaye mi.
Didn't think about it.	Ko ro nipa o.
He is calling for help.	O n pe fun iranlọwọ.
I feel really bad.	Mo lero gan buburu.
As yet we are all in town.	Bi sibẹsibẹ gbogbo wa ni ilu.
He takes the girls out.	O gba awọn ọmọbirin jade.
But first, time to laugh at the one-year anniversary.	Ṣugbọn akọkọ, akoko lati rẹrin ni ayẹyẹ ọdun kan.
And on.	Ati lori.
I missed it for a few weeks.	Mo padanu rẹ fun ọsẹ diẹ.
Go away!	Kuro patapata!
For some reason it will not break.	Fun idi kan kii yoo fọ.
I have a good job.	Mo ni ise to dara.
To help them.	Lati ran wọn lọwọ.
I do not like.	Emi ko feran.
Our fault is not with the person, but with the device.	Aṣiṣe wa ko pẹlu eniyan, ṣugbọn pẹlu ẹrọ naa.
At school.	Ni ile-iwe.
Things coming up.	Ohun bọ soke.
Maybe you have time, is something else.	Boya o ni akoko, jẹ ohun miiran.
He lost his job.	O padanu iṣẹ rẹ.
I made games they enjoyed.	Mo ṣe awọn ere ti wọn gbadun.
But none of them are young.	Ṣugbọn ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o jẹ odo.
And not without reason.	Ati pe kii ṣe laisi idi.
It works because you believe in that purpose.	O ṣiṣẹ nitori pe o gbagbọ ninu idi naa.
If anyone comes out, pick them up.	Ti ẹnikẹni ba jade, gbe wọn soke.
I do not know what is the matter with him.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o jẹ ọrọ pẹlu rẹ.
One of these days.	Ọkan ninu awọn wọnyi ọjọ.

He was born with a body.	O si a bi pẹlu kan ara.
Please note that the test will be time consuming.	Jọwọ ṣe akiyesi pe idanwo naa yoo jẹ akoko.
He did it again.	O tun ṣe.

They will tell you that, if you ask them.	Wọn yoo sọ fun ọ pe, ti o ba beere lọwọ wọn.
I have no more words to say.	Emi ko ni awọn ọrọ diẹ sii lati sọ.
The information is in the newspaper.	Alaye naa wa ninu iwe iroyin.
That is if not faster than what we have seen.	Iyẹn ni ti ko ba yara ju ohun ti a ti rii lọ.
Fires have broken out all over the city.	Awọn ina ti jade ni gbogbo ilu.
He locked the door to keep the place warm.	O ti ilẹkun lati jẹ ki ibi naa gbona.
Some people have a gift.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ni ẹbun kan.
There is a lot outside.	Pupọ wa ni aaye ita.
Most major accidents are more than two drivers.	Pupọ julọ awọn ijamba nla jẹ diẹ sii ju awọn awakọ meji lọ.
Build this house to your heart.	Kọ ile yii si ọkan rẹ.

Remove everyone at the same time.	Mu gbogbo eniyan kuro ni akoko kanna.

At one point he thought he was happy.	Ni akoko kan o ro pe o dun.
Not a bad morning job.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ owurọ buburu kan.

There was not a single information that was not taken into account.	Ko si alaye kan ti a ko ṣe akiyesi.
But that doesn’t mean it sells out.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko tumọ si pe o ta jade.
There is not much to do here for young people.	Ko si ohun pupọ lati ṣe nibi fun awọn ọdọ.
I made a decision.	Mo ṣe ipinnu kan.

He put his hand up to her as he finished.	O fi ọwọ rẹ si oke rẹ nigbati o ti pari.
The game is simple but the rules are not well laid out.	Awọn ere ni o rọrun ṣugbọn awọn ofin ti wa ni ko daradara gbe jade.

All eyes are on her.	Gbogbo oju ni o wa lori rẹ.
Those words keep it true.	Awọn ọrọ yẹn pa a mọ ni otitọ.
Don't go and ask him.	Maṣe lọ beere fun u.
That makes me laugh now.	Eyi mu mi rẹrin ni bayi.
The same goes for parents.	Kanna n lọ fun awọn obi.
He will not tell me.	Ko ni so fun mi.

You're making sure.	O n rii daju.

When you start to talk to yourself.	Nigbati o ba bẹrẹ lati ba ara rẹ sọrọ.
But when he started, he was still a man again.	Ṣugbọn nigbati o bẹrẹ, o tun jẹ ọkunrin lẹẹkansi.
I bought this, this, and this.	Mo ra eyi, eyi, ati eyi.
That is not a problem.	Iyẹn ko ni iṣoro.

The sun has set.	Oorun ti wọ.

Now it looks like another building.	Bayi o dabi ile miiran.
This service is not very popular.	Iṣẹ yii ko nifẹ pupọ.
Everyone in town loves it.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o wa ni ilu ni o fẹran rẹ.
His two other friends are in the back.	Awọn ọrẹ rẹ meji miiran wa ni ẹhin.
Once it started, it was fast.	Ni kete ti o bẹrẹ, o yara.
We were great friends and did everything together.	A jẹ ọrẹ nla ati ṣe ohun gbogbo papọ.
This year they are still there.	Ni ọdun yii wọn tun wa.
For your people.	Fun awon eniyan re.

She is worried that her husband will not like the dress.	O ni aniyan pe ọkọ rẹ ko ni fẹ aṣọ naa.
You can't get laid either.	O ko le gba gbe boya.
Maybe he would like to see me again.	Boya oun yoo fẹ lati ri mi lẹẹkansi.
They do not need much else.	Wọn ko nilo pupọ miiran.
But these people need some rest.	Ṣugbọn awọn eniyan wọnyi nilo isinmi diẹ.
And if they can't, that's not really my problem.	Ati pe ti wọn ko ba le, kii ṣe iṣoro mi gaan.
If you can find these, take note.	Ti o ba le rii awọn wọnyi, ṣe akiyesi.

Maybe not too much, maybe a long time.	Boya kii ṣe pupọ, boya igba pipẹ.
I think that is the new name that calls for you new.	Mo ro pe iyẹn ni orukọ tuntun ti o pe fun iwọ tuntun.
And at least there are problems.	Ati pe o kere julọ ti awọn iṣoro wa.
I can't really think of that.	Emi ko le ro ero rẹ gaan.
The room itself is important.	Yara funrararẹ ṣe pataki.
And the same problem will appear.	Ati pe iṣoro kanna yoo han.
And my imagination won.	Ati oju inu mi gba.
Women can see.	Awọn obinrin le rii.
He called the woman.	O pe obinrin naa.
There is nothing that you have to do to change.	Ko si ohun ti o ni lati ṣe lati yipada.
The boy could not sleep.	Ọmọkunrin naa ko le sun.
He did not ask what happened to him.	Ko beere ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si i.
Not good for performance, this method is very good.	Ko dara fun iṣẹ ṣiṣe, ọna yii dara julọ.
And with them, something else.	Ati pẹlu wọn, nkan miiran.
I am too fast.	Mo yara ju.
I would like to talk to you about your wife.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ba ọ sọrọ nipa iyawo rẹ.
I have no interest in them.	Emi ko ni anfani ninu wọn.
You can also kill yourself.	O tun le pa ara rẹ.
Prices will be available for your information.	Iye owo yoo wa fun alaye rẹ.
This can be removed in the future.	A le yọ eyi kuro ni ojo iwaju.
But don't tell him.	Ṣugbọn maṣe sọ fun u pe.

This will not be possible in a city area.	Eyi kii yoo ṣee ṣe ni agbegbe ilu kan.
It's time to get up and read.	O to akoko lati dide ki a ka.
This applies to me very much.	Eleyi kan mi gidigidi.
At no cost to you.	Laisi iye owo fun ọ.
Not for me, this is my home.	Kii ṣe fun mi, eyi ni ile mi.
I said so to him.	Mo sọ bẹ fun u.
He has a daughter of the same age as my daughter.	O ni ọmọbirin kan ti o jẹ ọjọ ori kanna pẹlu ọmọbirin mi.
And you have won.	Ati pe o ti gba.
But he is here now.	Ṣugbọn o wa nibi ni bayi.
There are no problems there.	Ko si awọn iṣoro nibẹ.
I'll take the car, meet you in front.	Emi yoo gba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ, pade rẹ ni iwaju.
Water in the future.	Omi ni ojo iwaju.
It’s amazing, even.	O ṣe iyalẹnu, paapaa.
The letter was written to me.	Iwe naa ni a kọ si mi.
I do not need it.	Emi ko nilo rẹ.
The date range did not appear as expected.	Agbegbe ọjọ ko han bi o ti ṣe yẹ.
Books are in.	Awọn iwe wa ninu.
Let us help you.	Jẹ ki a ran ọ lọwọ.
He said he did not like people watching his work.	O sọ pe oun ko fẹran awọn eniyan ti n wo iṣẹ rẹ.
There was an accident on the road.	Ijamba kan wa lori opopona.
Where you start in life is very important.	Ibi ti o bẹrẹ ni igbesi aye jẹ pataki pupọ.
How long they have gone.	Bawo ni pipẹ ti wọn ti lọ.
Money is human, you can lose.	Owo ti eniyan ni, o le padanu.
But those things are a real issue.	Ṣugbọn awọn nkan yẹn jẹ ọrọ ti o daju.
There was no board.	Nibẹ je ko si ọkọ.
Most people cannot understand what happened to you.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ko le loye ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si ọ.
Books have taught him a lot.	Awọn iwe ti kọ ọ pupọ.
I know he hasn’t thought much about kids before.	Mo mọ pe ko tii ronu pupọ nipa awọn ọmọde tẹlẹ.
Like, very nice people.	Bii, awọn eniyan ti o dara pupọ.
This road will change slightly.	Opopona yii o si yipada diẹ.
Some work rotating and some not.	Diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ n yi ati diẹ ninu awọn ko.
The picture, please.	Jọwọ, aworan naa.
You get in your head.	O gba ninu rẹ ori.
He waited for a few minutes.	O duro fun iṣẹju diẹ.
The world can always use a good.	Aye le nigbagbogbo lo kan ti o dara.
Everyone loves children.	Gbogbo eniyan nifẹ awọn ọmọde.
One to help yourself.	Ọkan lati ran ara rẹ lọwọ.
Just one that makes them money.	Kan kan ti o mu ki wọn owo.
That is not the case.	Iyẹn ko ri bẹẹ.
I hit.	Mo ti lu.
He is a little boy.	Ọmọ kekere kan ni.
I haven't used it myself, but it's worth a try.	Mo ti ko lo o ara mi, sugbon o tọ kan gbiyanju.
This eye is on fire.	Oju yi wa lori ina.
This application will help you to learn.	Ohun elo yii yoo ran ọ lọwọ lati kọ ẹkọ.
We are here, and they need us.	A wa nibi, ati pe wọn nilo wa.
It is not possible to believe the truth, however.	Kii ṣe pe o ṣee ṣe lati gba otitọ gbọ, sibẹsibẹ.
And it is more than that.	Ati pe o jẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
Nothing can stop us now.	Ko si ohun ti yoo da wa duro ni bayi.
It tired me after a day's work in the fields.	O rẹ mi lẹhin iṣẹ ọjọ kan ni awọn aaye.
Rules are rules.	Awọn ofin jẹ awọn ofin.
Without the past.	Laisi awọn ti o ti kọja.
Or maybe.	Tabi iya.
This is where it all goes wrong.	Eyi ni ibi ti gbogbo rẹ ti jẹ aṣiṣe.
Experiment with the following materials.	Ṣe idanwo pẹlu awọn ohun elo wọnyi.
But the little boy refused.	Ṣugbọn ọmọkunrin kekere naa kọ.
I told the child other things.	Mo sọ fun ọmọ naa awọn nkan miiran.
I carried it on my head.	Mo ti gbe ni ori mi.
They are watching.	Wọn n wo.
We tried to find them in town.	A gbiyanju lati wa wọn ni ilu.
Take advantage of the information inside.	Lo anfani ti inu alaye.
We do not sell our values.	A ko ta awọn iye wa jade.
Just another year.	O kan miiran odun.
The test did not go well.	Idanwo naa ko lọ daradara.
And in this way too.	Ati ni ọna yii paapaa.
My other books are very much about people who have died.	Awọn iwe mi miiran jẹ pupọ julọ nipa awọn eniyan ti o ti ku.
And it’s worth it, too.	Ati pe o tọ bẹ, paapaa.
I find it easy to leave.	Mo rii pe o rọrun lati lọ kuro.
Too many students too little to remember.	Pupọ julọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe kere ju lati ranti.
The story of interest to us is behind the issue.	Itan ti o nifẹ si wa lẹhin ọrọ naa.
So, she decided not to go.	Nitorina, o pinnu lati ko lọ.
It won’t be more of that, either.	Kii yoo jẹ diẹ sii ti iyẹn, boya.
Two years have passed since the bill was passed.	Ọdun meji ti kọja lati igba ti owo naa ti kọja.
To take away.	Lati mu kuro.
Let's get the other one.	Jẹ ká gba awọn miiran ọkan.
Their lives have completely changed and will never be the same.	Aye wọn ti yipada patapata ati pe kii yoo jẹ kanna lailai.
We write them.	A ko wọn.
If they need help, they will say so there.	Ti wọn ba nilo iranlọwọ, wọn yoo sọ bẹ nibẹ.
We will need this.	A yoo nilo eyi.
Without the company name, the question is also obvious.	Laisi orukọ ile-iṣẹ naa, ibeere naa tun han gbangba.
No, it's not something like that.	Rara, kii ṣe nkankan bi iyẹn.
And new companies have similar functions.	Ati awọn ile-iṣẹ tuntun ni awọn iṣẹ iru kanna.
And most of them don’t.	Ati pupọ ninu wọn ko ṣe.
Some of you are there or are in it now.	Diẹ ninu yin ti wa nibẹ tabi o wa ninu rẹ ni bayi.
You can’t think anyone else wants it.	O ko le ro pe ẹnikẹni miiran fẹ.
I'll tell you what you got away with.	Emi yoo so fun o ohun ti o ni kuro lori.
You can enjoy this.	O le gbadun eyi.
They have found enough work.	Wọn ti ri iṣẹ to.
It's full when you open.	O kun nigbati o ṣii.
I should not be here.	Emi ko yẹ ki o wa si ibi.
Okay with that.	Dara pẹlu iyẹn.
It's work, it's work.	Iṣẹ ni, iṣẹ kan ni.
We will not play this game.	A ko ni ṣe ere ero yii.
He got at home and played at work.	O ni ni ile ati mu ṣiṣẹ ni iṣẹ.
I pulled away.	Mo fa kuro.
I don't see that.	Emi ko rii iyẹn wa.
There is no reason for you to keep up.	Ko si idi fun o lati pa soke.
You will pull through.	Iwọ yoo fa nipasẹ.
My car is off the road.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi ti wa ni oke ni opopona.
It may be something they should use to their advantage.	O le jẹ nkan ti wọn yẹ ki o lo si anfani wọn.
This should be enough to get us through the week.	Eyi yẹ ki o to lati gba wa nipasẹ ọsẹ.
It takes a few minutes to find the words.	O nilo awọn iṣẹju diẹ lati wa awọn ọrọ.
Which is a lot.	Eyi ti o jẹ pupọ.
Not as fun as you might think.	Ko bi fun bi o ti le ro.
Your personal information will not be sold.	Alaye ti ara ẹni rẹ kii yoo ta.
But that no one will eat me.	Ṣugbọn pe ẹnikan kii yoo jẹ mi.
But that too is good.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn dara paapaa.
Just knowing this is not enough.	Nikan mọ eyi ko to.
It is upstairs.	O wa ni oke.
Did not find it.	Ko ri i.
Don’t be afraid to experiment.	Maṣe bẹru lati ṣe idanwo.
It is out of range.	O ti wa ni ibiti.
Do not try to move.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati gbe.
So she went with her parents and their growing children.	Nitorina o lọ pẹlu awọn obi ati awọn ọmọ wọn ti o dagba.
I'm done now.	Mo ti pari ni bayi.
They will take me into the house.	Wọn yoo gba mi sinu ile naa.
The words will not come.	Awọn ọrọ naa kii yoo wa.
It happens all the time but not always.	O ti n ṣẹlẹ nigbagbogbo ṣugbọn ni gbogbo igba kii ṣe nibẹ.
There is no small bag at this time.	Ko si apo kekere ni akoko yii.
Today, everyone does everything.	Loni, gbogbo eniyan ṣe ohun gbogbo.
But other than that, it is very good.	Ṣugbọn miiran ju iyẹn lọ, o dara pupọ.
It doesn't matter, you know.	Ko ṣe pataki, o mọ.
Others come along.	Awọn miiran wa pẹlu.
The task is not easy.	Iṣẹ naa ko rọrun.
Tell your child.	Sọ fun ọmọ rẹ.
It shook my head.	O mi ori.
I wrote them in and that was it.	Mo kọ wọn sinu ati pe iyẹn ni.
Just sorry for him alone.	O kan binu fun u nikan.
And his family.	Ati ebi re.
He could not go home.	Ko le lọ si ile.
Her last thought was of her family	Rẹ kẹhin ero wà ti ebi re
Only your wisdom.	Ọgbọn rẹ nikan.
Every doctor is.	Gbogbo dokita ni.
Kids love this game.	Awọn ọmọde nifẹ ere yii.
Do not look up at all.	Maṣe wo soke rara.
We are not at all.	A ko wa rara.
At least a few.	O kere ju diẹ.
He waited for me in arms and legs.	O duro de mi ni ọwọ ati ẹsẹ.
If you go, you go.	Ti o ba lọ, o lọ.
He looked into the room downstairs.	O wo inu yara ti o wa ni isalẹ.
It is a dead picture.	O jẹ aworan ti o ku.
I want you to know that it means a lot to me.	Mo fẹ ki o mọ pe o tumọ si mi pupọ.
You only need to wait for three hours.	O nilo lati duro fun wakati mẹta nikan.
He came to us for help.	O wa si wa fun iranlọwọ.
Sometimes people do not want to hear them.	Nigba miiran awọn eniyan ko fẹ gbọ wọn.

It is on a hill.	O wa lori oke kan.
He landed hard on his back.	O de le lori ẹhin rẹ.
From my students.	Lati awọn ọmọ ile-iwe mi.
She loves her room and her bed.	O nifẹ yara rẹ ati ibusun rẹ.
But you never know whether someone will go with you.	Ṣugbọn ti o ko mọ boya ẹnikan ba lọ pẹlu rẹ.
I just a few women than men in this city can handle.	Mo kan diẹ obinrin ju awọn ọkunrin ni ilu yi le mu.
It's as simple as that.	O rọrun bi iyẹn.
You know how important it is.	O mọ bi o ṣe ṣe pataki.
On their work.	Lori iṣẹ wọn.
Go try it.	Lọ gbiyanju rẹ.
Love your love story.	Nifẹ itan ifẹ rẹ.
It is gone.	O ti lọ silẹ.
You can't find a home, he said.	O ko le ri ile, o sọ.
You go, girls.	O lọ, awọn ọmọbirin.
It's too high for me.	O ga diẹ fun mi.
Essentially they should do the same thing.	Ni pataki wọn yẹ ki o ṣe ohun kanna.
Devices change all the time.	Awọn ẹrọ yipada ni gbogbo igba.
I think we have problems.	Mo ro pe a ni awọn iṣoro.
They didn’t think they would, but they did.	Wọn ko ro pe wọn yoo, ṣugbọn wọn ṣe.
He made the game right.	O mu ere naa tọ.
He did not ask for an opportunity.	Oun ko beere fun anfani.
You like it.	O feran re.
Very hot, last day of very hot week.	Gbona pupọ, ọjọ ikẹhin ti ọsẹ ti o gbona pupọ.
He said it was very important.	O sọ pe o ṣe pataki pupọ.
You get it.	O gba a.
And that was a big deal.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ adehun nla.
You have told him the truth.	O ti sọ otitọ fun u.
Your information system is beautiful.	Ọna alaye rẹ lẹwa.
I did not go through it.	Emi ko lọ nipasẹ rẹ.
We do not know the number of students in your class.	A ko mọ iye awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ti o wa ninu kilasi rẹ.
The other two were removed.	Awọn meji miiran ti yọ kuro.
A piece of advice, baby, if you are in or if you are out.	Nkan ti imọran, ọmọ, ti o ba wa ni tabi ti o ba wa jade.
So see how you talk to yourself.	Nitorina wo bi o ṣe n ba ara rẹ sọrọ.
No one will ever send your letter.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo fi lẹta rẹ ranṣẹ lailai.
We found it taken again.	A rii pe o ya lẹẹkansi.
That's how they talk about it.	Bi wọn ṣe n sọrọ nipa rẹ niyẹn.
I want to travel by bus.	Mo fẹ lati rin nipasẹ ọkọ akero.

This did not happen.	Eleyi ko ṣẹlẹ.
Just look at it.	O kan wo o.
He tried to keep us all.	O gbiyanju lati pa gbogbo wa mọ.
We have to find a way.	A ni lati wa ọna kan.
Whatever you get, you do.	Ohunkohun ti o gba, o ṣe.
I called again, and again, and again.	Mo pe lẹẹkansi, ati lẹẹkansi, ati lẹẹkansi.
And the other was not.	Ati awọn miiran wà ko.
I have always seen my mother in her garden.	Mo ti ri iya mi nigbagbogbo ninu ọgba rẹ.
He lives nearby.	O ngbe nitosi.
We can look good.	A le wo nkan ti o dara.
And it is not beautiful.	Ati pe ko lẹwa.
He did not take my shoes off.	Ko gba bata mi kuro.
You can see the mountains from above there.	O le wo awọn oke nla lati oke nibẹ.
I just called me up.	Mo kan pe mi soke.
They clean inside and out, from top to bottom.	Wọn nu inu ati ita, lati oke de isalẹ.
It is late in the afternoon.	O ti pẹ ni ọsan.
And everyone will have such a gift.	Ati gbogbo eniyan yoo ni iru ẹbun.
It is not easy to raise the money.	Ko rọrun lati gbe owo naa.
We are all taught to read.	Gbogbo wa ni a kọ lati ka.
How nice of you to be here.	Bawo ni o ṣe dara fun ọ lati wa nibi.
You can only carry one bag on board.	O le mu apo kan nikan wa lori ọkọ.
They played a great game.	Wọn ṣe ere nla kan.
My mother explained it this way.	Iya mi ṣe alaye rẹ ni ọna yii.
I will play the game.	Emi yoo ṣe ere naa.
Feeling that this group is a more physical group.	Rilara pe ẹgbẹ yii jẹ ẹgbẹ ti ara diẹ sii.
It will not be available now.	O ko ni wa ni bayi.
If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.	Ti o ba fẹ ki nkan kan ṣe daradara, o ni lati ṣe funrararẹ.
You can not force it.	O ko le fi agbara mu.
They do not like details.	Wọn ko fẹran awọn alaye.
It is not my job to keep everything.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ mi lati tọju ohun gbogbo.
I don’t think it took out much.	Emi ko ro pe o gba jade Elo.
Take time to think through your words.	Gba akoko lati ronu nipasẹ awọn ọrọ rẹ.
Your house has many rooms.	Ile rẹ ni ọpọlọpọ awọn yara.
I need to talk to you.	Mo nilo lati ba ọ sọrọ.
Call someone to pick up the girls from school.	Pe ẹnikan lati gbe awọn ọmọbirin lati ile-iwe.
Such is the case.	Iru ipo bẹẹ ni.
You can really see one of the groups below not.	O le gan ri ọkan ninu awọn ẹgbẹ ni isalẹ ko.
I mean, by now, you have seen.	Mo tumọ si, nipasẹ bayi, o ti rii.
What's this? 	Kini eleyi?
I'll leave.	Emi yoo fi silẹ.
Decide this for yourself and what it means for you.	Pinnu eyi fun ara rẹ ati kini o tumọ si fun ọ.
We don't need one.	A ko nilo ọkan.
Also unknown.	Tun ti ko mọ.
I know you better than that.	Mo mọ ọ ju iyẹn lọ.
But there are still many summers.	Ṣugbọn ọpọlọpọ igba ooru tun wa.
They certainly are not.	Wọn dajudaju kii ṣe.
Nothing special.	Ko si nkan pataki.
Road trips with trails.	Awọn irin-ajo irin-ajo pẹlu awọn ọna.
But it is not just ourselves.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ara wa nikan.
I lost my head.	Mo ti padanu ori rẹ.
I'm sure you can.	Mo da mi loju pe o le se.
It means it is the best music they have.	O tumọ si pe o jẹ orin ti o dara julọ ti wọn ni.
No, stop.	Rara, da duro.
I would love to talk to you when you can.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ba ọ sọrọ nigbati o ba le.
This is a clean lesson.	Eyi jẹ ẹkọ ti o mọ.
I have read the whole thing.	Mo ti ka gbogbo nkan naa.
She felt herself growing hot.	O ro ara rẹ dagba gbona.
You don't need it.	Ko nilo rẹ.
Today is not true.	Loni kii ṣe otitọ.
But after playing for a while, he decided not to come back.	Ṣugbọn lẹhin ti o ṣe ere ni akoko kan, o pinnu lati ko pada.
They can't touch me.	Wọn ko le fi ọwọ kan mi.
In fact, there is love for everyone who is open to it.	Ni otitọ, ifẹ wa fun gbogbo eniyan ti o ṣii si rẹ.
We should buy more food.	A yẹ ki o ra ounjẹ diẹ sii.
There is a lot of money around out there.	Nibẹ ni a pupo ti owo ni ayika jade nibẹ.
The man did not pay attention to her.	Ọkunrin naa ko san akiyesi rẹ.
But about that.	Ṣugbọn nipa eyi.
My body is under it.	Ara mi ti wa labẹ rẹ.
There was no more time that day.	Ko si akoko diẹ ju ni ọjọ naa.
You read that marriage is important.	O ka pe igbeyawo ṣe pataki.
They should get something from someone.	Wọn yẹ ki o gba nkankan lati ọdọ ẹnikan.
I believe we are looking for the wrong places.	Mo gbagbọ pe a n wa awọn aaye ti ko tọ.
You are gone.	O ti lọ.
They are not.	Wọn ko wa.
He is angry.	O binu.
Very good.	O dara gaan.
But he entered.	Ṣugbọn o wọ.
He is in a critical condition.	O wa ni ipo ti o ni ipalara.
I will not let that happen.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
if any.	ti o ba ti eyikeyi.
And outside of it.	Ati ni ita rẹ.
You think it's good.	O ro pe o dara.
Think it.	Ro o.
We have to work together.	A ni lati ṣiṣẹ papọ.
Always keep the food.	Pa ounjẹ naa mọ nigbagbogbo.
Their hands touched for a minute, but did not speak.	Ọwọ wọn kan fun iṣẹju kan, ṣugbọn ko sọrọ.
Now just think about this for a minute.	Bayi o kan ronu nipa eyi fun iṣẹju kan.
They just found something.	Wọn kan rii nkan.
Not everyone has things either.	Ko gbogbo eniyan ni o ni awon ohun boya.
Thus, it is personal.	Bayi, o jẹ ti ara ẹni.
I think we need more of that.	Mo ro pe a nilo diẹ sii ti iyẹn.
Three years ago.	Ni ọdun mẹta sẹhin.
Have to ask him something.	Ni lati beere lọwọ rẹ nkankan.
Help me know where the problem lies.	Ran mi lọwọ lati mọ ibi ti iṣoro naa wa.
We do something family.	A ṣe nkan ti idile.
Now is the true time.	Bayi ni akoko otitọ.
This is a very difficult decision.	Eyi jẹ ipinnu lile gaan.
We read the whole thing.	A ka gbogbo nkan naa.
The information was released.	A fi alaye naa silẹ.
And there he was.	Ati nibẹ o si wà.
I asked him what was going on through his head.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ pe kini o n ṣẹlẹ nipasẹ ori rẹ.
Just what it is.	O kan ohun ti o jẹ.
But that's it.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ni.
Contact for help.	Kan si fun iranlọwọ.
They live in us.	Won n gbe inu wa.
But most of his attention is on what’s happening outside.	Ṣugbọn pupọ julọ akiyesi rẹ wa lori ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ ni ita.
But it didn’t do any good.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe eyikeyi ti o dara.
Those seats have already been won.	Awọn ijoko yẹn ti gba tẹlẹ.
But you must see for yourself.	Ṣugbọn o gbọdọ rii fun ara rẹ.
Many were there talking.	Ọpọlọpọ wa nibẹ sọrọ.
Maybe a week late.	Boya ọsẹ kan pẹ.
That will do for me.	Iyẹn yoo ṣe fun mi.
Okay, that’s easy.	O dara, iyẹn rọrun.
They have to know me.	Wọn ni lati mọ mi.
He had sold the boy inside and out.	O ti ta ọmọkunrin naa inu ati ita.
For years now.	Fun ọdun bayi.
Nothing is known about him.	Ko si ohun ti a mọ nipa rẹ.
But it was hard.	Sugbon o je lile.
You must be in this store.	O gbọdọ wa ni ile itaja yii.
It comes with it doing something.	O wa pẹlu o ṣe nkan kan.
If something is not known, they do not know.	Ti nkan kan ko ba mọ, wọn ko mọ.
We will not be.	A kii yoo jẹ.
You need to let them understand what you want.	O nilo lati jẹ ki wọn ni oye ohun ti o fẹ.
His father again.	Baba rẹ lẹẹkansi.
We are not good.	A ki o dara.
He has been running for a long time.	O ti n sare fun igba pipẹ.
So high up.	Nitorina ga soke.
If you have life, go and see it.	Ti o ba ni aye, lọ ki o rii i.
I remember that he touched me so much.	Mo ranti pe o fi ọwọ kan mi bẹ.
We do not know enough.	A ko mọ to.
There is nothing there.	Ko si nkankan nibẹ.
That is no longer known.	Iyẹn ko si mọ.
We want to stay forever.	A fẹ lati duro lailai.
Years have passed.	Awọn ọdun ti kọja.
I will go and talk to him if one of you is with me.	Emi yoo lọ ba a sọrọ ti ọkan ninu yin ba wa pẹlu mi.
Again, this is not surprising.	Lẹẹkansi, eyi kii ṣe iyalẹnu.
The city was a place of great learning at that time.	Ilu naa jẹ aaye ti ẹkọ nla ni akoko yẹn.
Think about the power of your own words.	Ronu nipa agbara ti awọn ọrọ tirẹ.
It’s worth it in the end.	O tọ si ni ipari.
That is not happening now.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ ni bayi.
You may have to get another !.	O le ni lati gba miiran!.
Just know.	O kan mọ.
Try as you can, he can not sleep.	Gbiyanju bi o ṣe le, ko le sun.
It happened.	O ṣẹlẹ.
We were really upset.	A wà gan ga soke.
We will have another hour or so before we return.	A yoo tun ni wakati kan tabi bẹ ṣaaju ki a to pada.
Your decision here.	Ipinnu rẹ nibi.
Talking to him wisely is not possible.	Sọrọ ọgbọn si rẹ ko ṣee ṣe.
You are right, you know.	O tọ, o mọ.
Something will go wrong.	Nkankan yoo lọ ti ko tọ.
I really feel like they like me.	Mo lero gaan bi wọn fẹ mi.
It may be late.	O le pẹ.
Both hate it completely.	Awọn mejeeji korira rẹ patapata.
I can't ask anything.	Emi ko le beere ohunkohun.
Everyone deserves to be feared.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o tọ lati bẹru rẹ.
Some of us.	Diẹ ninu wa.
Make sure to be early to get a good seat.	Rii daju lati wa ni kutukutu lati gba ijoko ti o dara.
That is especially important.	Iyẹn jẹ pataki paapaa.
I have already eaten breakfast.	Mo ti jẹ ounjẹ owurọ tẹlẹ.
And the movement.	Ati awọn ronu.
Just treat them.	O kan tọju wọn.
It is as old as time.	O jẹ itan ti atijọ bi akoko.
So we were brought back with us.	Nitorina a ti mu pada pẹlu wa.
He said it happened a long time ago.	O sọ pe o ṣẹlẹ ni igba pipẹ sẹhin.
That is most likely the cause of the problem.	Iyẹn ṣee ṣe julọ idi ti iṣoro naa.
But you would not want to do that.	Ṣugbọn iwọ kii yoo fẹ lati ṣe eyi.
It is sometimes.	O jẹ awọn igba miiran.
This thing we have, it is for a while.	Nkan yi ti a ni, o jẹ fun igba diẹ.
I am in the right place.	Mo wa ni ibi ti o tọ.
It is very easy to use.	O rọrun pupọ lati lo.
He wondered how much it would cost.	O ṣe iyalẹnu iye ti yoo jẹ.
No, we can't fly.	Rara, a ko le fo.
I'm sorry, and you should too.	Mo binu, ati pe o yẹ ki o tun.
I know something about it, but not enough.	Mo mọ nkankan nipa o, sugbon ko to.
But it is.	Sugbon o jẹ.
He left in the morning.	O kuro ni owurọ.
I am.	Emi naa.
I have my own car.	Mo ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti ara mi.
The player with the longest hair goes first.	Ẹrọ orin ti o ni irun ti o gun julọ lọ ni akọkọ.
He did not have one of them until a meeting place.	Ko ni ọkan ninu rẹ titi de ibi ipade kan.
The music seemed to make sense.	Awọn orin dabi enipe lati ṣe ori.
That’s where the work comes in.	Iyẹn ni ibi ti iṣẹ naa wa.
It will take them a while to die, but they die.	Yoo gba wọn fun igba diẹ lati ku, ṣugbọn wọn ku.
What that means, he is not sure.	Ohun ti iyẹn tumọ si, ko da oun loju.
I don't see why you can't.	Emi ko rii idi ti o ko le.
This is something we all have.	Eyi jẹ nkan ti gbogbo wa ni.
Tell them anything.	Sọ ohunkohun fun wọn.
Remove them from the heat and enjoy !.	Yọ wọn kuro ninu ooru ati gbadun !.
Some even make us want to fit in with each other.	Diẹ ninu awọn paapaa jẹ ki a fẹ lati ba ara wa mu.
All that should take into account.	Gbogbo awọn ti o yẹ ki o gba sinu iroyin.
For a while again they were themselves.	Fun igba diẹ lẹẹkansi wọn jẹ ara wọn.
I have some nice clothes, but not much.	Mo ni diẹ ninu awọn aṣọ to dara, ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ.
Some men reject marriage.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọkunrin kọ igbeyawo.
Didn't see that we were trying to get out.	Ko rii pe a n gbiyanju lati jade.
He does not know anyone.	Ko mọ enikeni.
He did not drive there.	Ko wakọ nibẹ.
But it is not so anymore.	Ṣugbọn ko ri bẹ mọ.
Foot by foot.	Ẹsẹ nipa ẹsẹ.
When your time comes.	Nigbati akoko re de.
That you can use.	Ti o le lo.
He walked like a man.	O rin bi ọkunrin.
Remove them all.	Yọ gbogbo wọn kuro.
We need to have someone in me.	A nilo lati ni ẹnikan ninu mi.
He is dead.	O ti ku.
You can do pretty much anything.	O le ṣe lẹwa Elo ohunkohun.
To search or pull on the head.	Lati wa tabi fa si ori.
Back to the celebration.	Pada si ayẹyẹ naa.
We can give you the best time of your life.	A le fun ọ ni akoko ti o dara julọ ti igbesi aye rẹ.
We will leave him out of the question.	A yoo fi i silẹ kuro ninu ibeere naa.
It is not a written matter.	Kii ṣe ọrọ ti o ti kọ.
So you say.	Nitorina o ti sọ.
Stay off the streets.	Duro si pa awọn ita.
It took me a minute.	O mu mi iṣẹju kan.
It depends on the others.	O da lori awọn miiran.
People are talking about them.	Awọn eniyan n sọrọ nipa wọn.
Your system is working.	Eto rẹ n ṣiṣẹ.
That does not mean.	Iyẹn ko tumọ si.
He lost his head.	O padanu ori.
Of course not one on one.	Dajudaju kii ṣe ọkan lori ọkan.
He can’t let it get in now, he said to himself.	Ko le jẹ ki o gba ni bayi, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
It is possible to learn not to beat a woman.	O ṣee ṣe lati kọ ẹkọ lati maṣe lu obinrin kan.
You have decided about it.	O ti pinnu nipa rẹ.
Men love power.	Awọn ọkunrin nifẹ agbara.
I hope for the best.	Mo nireti ohun ti o dara julọ.
I don’t need to know more than that.	Emi ko nilo lati mọ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
I was sitting at that table.	Mo ti joko lori tabili yẹn.
It doesn't matter who said it.	Ko ṣe pataki ẹniti o sọ ọ.
Anything other than children.	Ohun miiran ju awọn ọmọ.
On the go.	Lori a lọ.
He is just a person who wants to work, wants to learn.	O kan jẹ eniyan ti o fẹ ṣiṣẹ, fẹ lati kọ ẹkọ.
That requires.	Iyẹn nilo.
You did not write me love letters.	O ko kọ mi ife awọn lẹta.
He dropped me.	O ju mi ​​silẹ.
They have looked at it back.	Wọn ti wo rẹ pada.
My sister stayed with my mother.	Arabinrin mi duro pẹlu iya mi.
One man is in trouble, one is not.	Ọkunrin kan ni iṣoro, ọkan ko ni.
They see me.	Won ri mi.
Just a little.	O kan kekere kan.
He told himself he would be fine.	O sọ fun ara rẹ pe oun yoo dara.
Street art music.	Orin aworan ita.
We're screwed.	A ti de.
She wants to buy back her old house.	O fe lati ra pada rẹ atijọ ile.
That makes it even better.	Iyẹn jẹ ki o dara julọ paapaa.
Learn how to say it and people will want to read your work.	Kọ bi o ṣe sọ ati pe eniyan yoo fẹ lati ka iṣẹ rẹ.
Everything is in question again.	Ohun gbogbo wa ni ibeere lẹẹkansi.
And that is.	Ati pe iyẹn ni.
Sometimes it is not.	Nigba miiran kii ṣe bẹ.
However it is used below this level.	Sibẹsibẹ o ti lo ni isalẹ ipo yii.
I do not know what you are talking about!	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o n sọrọ nipa!
It doesn't do much work at all.	Ko ṣe iṣẹ pupọ rara.
The restaurant is full and warm.	Ile ounjẹ ti kun ati ki o gbona.
And maybe he died here or maybe he didn’t.	Ati boya o ku nibi tabi boya o ko.
Try to feel good about the whole thing.	Gbiyanju lati lero daradara nipa gbogbo nkan naa.
Didn’t see anything out of that.	Ko ri ohunkohun ti o jade ninu iyẹn.
These members also have many advantages.	Awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ wọnyi tun ni awọn anfani pupọ.
Little will tell me.	Kekere yoo sọ fun mi.
You are not around anymore.	O ko ni ayika mọ.
I'll be there tonight.	Emi yoo wa ni alẹ oni.
I have no news.	Nko ni iroyin kankan.
That he could not matter.	Wipe oun ko le ṣe pataki.
And no one really wants that.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹ iyẹn gaan.
No words.	Ko si ọrọ kankan.
No tea on.	Ko si tii lori.
He could not see his hair.	Ko ri irun ori rẹ.
I don't need anyone.	Nko nilo enikeni.
Walk me through what happened when he woke up.	Rin mi nipasẹ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nigbati o ji.
Got to get my drink in while the drink is good.	Ni lati gba mi mimu ni nigba ti mimu jẹ dara.
He liked the beautiful woman's face.	O fẹran oju lẹwa obinrin naa.
You don’t treat a man like a child.	Iwọ ko tọju ọkunrin bi ọmọde.
But one day it started.	Ṣugbọn ni ọjọ kan o bẹrẹ.
When people are doing what they love, you can say.	Nigbati eniyan ba n ṣe ohun ti wọn nifẹ, o le sọ.
Most people say they see.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan sọ pe wọn rii.
This man expressed his advice well.	Ọkunrin yii sọ imọran rẹ daradara.
Everything has to pay for.	Ohun gbogbo ni lati san fun.
Some benefits, however, do not come to us.	Diẹ ninu awọn anfani, sibẹsibẹ, ko wa lati wa.
Just really hard.	Kan gan lile.
Think about that.	Ronu nipa iyẹn.
I learned the story from her daughter.	Mo ti kọ itan naa lati ọdọ ọmọbirin rẹ.
I am sure it will come.	Mo da mi loju pe yoo wa.
Drink plenty of water.	Mu omi pupọ.
Feel free to use it.	Rilara pe o lo.
Tell them you're watching.	Sọ fun wọn pe o n ṣe akiyesi.
I live and live.	Mo n gbe ati ki o wa laaye.
You may have heard of me as well.	O le ti gbọ ti mi pẹlu.
I went with that one and it worked really well.	Mo lọ pẹlu ọkan yẹn ati pe o ṣiṣẹ daradara daradara.
Love it or hate it.	Nifẹ rẹ tabi korira rẹ.
Cost to help me.	Iye owo lati ran mi lọwọ.
The car is gone.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti lọ.
We thought there had been an accident.	A ro nibẹ ti wa ijamba.
But you will.	Ṣugbọn iwọ yoo.
And this time I'm not sure he did.	Ati ni akoko yii ko ni idaniloju pe o ṣe.
Most importantly, in the end, we were able to finish well.	Pataki julọ, ni ipari, a ni anfani lati pari daradara.
This can be the problem.	Eyi le jẹ iṣoro naa.
I agree here.	Mo ti gba nibi.
We are in trouble here.	A wa ninu wahala nibi.
She asked him what he planned to do with her.	O beere lọwọ rẹ kini o gbero lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
Do not take them back.	Maṣe gba wọn pada.
The flight takes two hours.	Irin-ajo ọkọ ofurufu gba wakati meji.
Look at this solar system.	Wo eto oorun yii.
The brother could speak at this time.	Arakunrin naa le sọrọ ni akoko yii.
No drivers to come.	Ko si awakọ lati wa.
This is not the first time the building has been.	Eyi kii ṣe igba akọkọ ti ile naa ti jẹ.
It's too long.	O ti gun ju.
But the game has already tied.	Ṣugbọn ere naa ti so tẹlẹ.
They live near the sea.	Wọn n gbe nitosi okun.
No, that is a mistake, though.	Rara, iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe, paapaa.
It will be a meeting of the world, such a thing.	Yoo jẹ ipade aye, iru nkan bẹẹ.
More drinking should be taken.	Ọna mimu diẹ sii yẹ ki o gba.
You will never know.	Iwọ kii yoo mọ.
There is still much to be done.	Pupọ ṣi wa lati ṣe.
It is good to get out of everything.	O dara lati lọ kuro ninu ohun gbogbo.
I wanted to do it again.	Mo fe lati se ti o lẹẹkansi.
Now you just come this way.	Bayi ti o ba kan wa ni ọna yii.
A law will not tell you that.	Ofin kan kii yoo sọ fun ọ pe.
This will not stop.	Eyi kii yoo duro.
It makes me want to hit someone.	O mu mi fẹ lati lu ẹnikan.
Finish without it.	Pari laisi rẹ.
It was time for her first class.	O jẹ akoko fun kilasi akọkọ rẹ.
It doesn’t work for any of us.	Ko ṣiṣẹ fun eyikeyi ninu wa.
See you here.	Wo o nibi.
Companies need to weather bad times.	Awọn ile-iṣẹ nilo lati ṣe oju ojo awọn akoko buburu.
He came to me and saw me.	O de mi o si ri mi.
Okay, that’s this.	O dara, iyẹn ni yii.
Everyone wants something in it.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ nkan kan ninu rẹ.
I know this world.	Mo mọ aye yi.
It is outside the box.	O wa ni ita apoti.
Children have working families.	Awọn ọmọde ni awọn idile ṣiṣẹ.
She has children.	O ni awọn ọmọde.
Most people think about it.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni ero nipa rẹ.
Thus, you must be able to play the game.	Bayi, o gbọdọ ni anfani lati mu ere naa.
Tell people about what is happening.	Sọ fun eniyan nipa ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
Often they ask to do.	Nigbagbogbo wọn beere lati ṣe.
To not have such love.	Lati ko ni iru ife.
Other details also appear now.	Awọn alaye miiran tun han ni bayi.
She did not want to help him.	O ko fẹ lati ran u lọwọ.
Please look at me.	Jọwọ wo mi.
So he decided to go.	Nitorina o pinnu lati lọ.
He is also married.	O si ti tun iyawo.
It has its highs.	O ni awọn giga rẹ.
He looks up.	O wo duro.
I came and saw nothing on my desk.	Mo wa ko si ri nkankan lori tabili mi.
Here, no one knows me.	Nibi, ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ mi.
You have a lot of time left.	O ni akoko pupọ ti o ku.
I know your concern.	Mo mọ aniyan rẹ.
Or let us think.	Tabi ki a ro.
How many is hard to say.	Bawo ni ọpọlọpọ jẹ gidigidi lati sọ.
And you never asked me to return.	Ati pe iwọ ko beere lọwọ mi lati pada.
One person will die soon.	Eniyan kan yoo ku laipẹ.
But he did not want to help them.	Ṣugbọn ko fẹ lati ran wọn lọwọ.
That was high, with some food in my eyes.	Iyẹn jẹ giga, pẹlu ounjẹ diẹ ni oju mi.
Not the main problem.	Kii ṣe iṣoro akọkọ.
I can not say whether it is good or bad.	Nko le so boya o dara tabi buburu.
Of course, if something unthinkable happens.	Dajudaju, ti ohun ti ko le ronu ba ṣẹlẹ.
That is what it should be.	Ohun ti o yẹ ki o jẹ niyẹn.
He obviously did not know what had happened.	O han gbangba pe ko mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
The so-called fire department.	Ile-iṣẹ ina ti a pe ni.
No problem.	Ko si iṣoro eyikeyi.
Not with his eyes.	Ko pẹlu oju rẹ.
Nothing happened.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Door of door.	Ilẹkun ti ilẹkun.
And listen again.	Ati ki o gbọ lẹẹkansi.
And to give us space to have more time together.	Ati lati fun wa ni aye lati ni akoko diẹ sii papọ.
I love the way it comes out.	Mo nifẹ ọna ti o jade.
You need to tell me what happened here.	O nilo lati so fun mi ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nibi.
I have heard this story before.	Mo ti gbọ itan yii tẹlẹ.
The mother, for me is an unknown value.	Iya naa, fun mi jẹ iye ti a ko mọ.
Maybe you should.	Boya o yẹ.
Many were moved to meet him.	Ọpọlọpọ ni wọn gbe lọ lati pade rẹ.
That was really great for them.	Iyẹn jẹ nla fun wọn gaan.
All of these things can be true at the same time.	Gbogbo nkan wọnyi le jẹ otitọ ni akoko kanna.
In the end, he locked them up.	Ni ipari, o tii wọn pa.
I do not know you are here.	Emi ko mọ pe o wa nibi.
There are others.	Awọn miiran wa.
Good to see you.	O dara ti o ba wo.
It has been hard to be here.	O ti jẹ gidigidi lati wa nibi.
Okay, back to the town room.	O dara, pada si yara ilu.
We have enough of those.	A ni to ti awon.
People are working.	Eniyan n ṣiṣẹ.
The box is outside.	Apoti naa ti wa ni ita.
That book is amazing.	Iwe yẹn jẹ iyanu.
This is accepted.	Eyi ti gba.
It stands for something you know to be true.	O duro fun ohun kan ti o mọ pe o jẹ otitọ.
He was very friendly.	O jẹ ọrẹ pupọ.
I am looking for something like this.	Mo n wa nkan bi eleyi.
And he went to get his mother and father.	Ati pe o lọ lati gba iya ati baba rẹ.
Everything before it works well.	Ohun gbogbo ṣaaju ki o to ṣiṣẹ daradara.
At least one person was arrested.	O kere ju eniyan kan ti mu.
Just enough.	O kan to.
I have my key in my hand.	Mo ni bọtini mi ni ọwọ mi.
It does not hurt.	Ko ṣe ipalara.
I am a woman who has to do it for myself.	Mo jẹ obinrin ti o ni lati ṣe fun ara mi.
He is with them.	O wa pẹlu wọn.
This was good.	Eleyi je dara.
If so, the truth is back, and the work is done.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, otitọ ti pada, ati pe iṣẹ naa ti pari.
Someone will come and get you.	Ẹnikan yoo wa gba ọ.
Agreements were made and they were married.	Awọn adehun ti a ti ṣe ati awọn ti wọn ni won ni iyawo.
What is football to lose ?.	Kini bọọlu ni lati padanu ?.
He has built the team in the best possible way.	O ti kọ ẹgbẹ naa ni ọna ti o dara julọ.
So this is my question.	Nitorina eyi ni awọn ibeere mi.
Not a place.	Ko ibi kan.
because they made their own way.	nitori wọn ṣe ọna ti ara wọn.
We sure do.	A daju ṣe.
You do a lot, man.	O ṣe pupọ, eniyan.
But none of this is new.	Ṣugbọn ko si ọkan ninu eyi jẹ tuntun.
That, and other things that bring us.	Iyẹn, ati awọn ohun miiran ti o mu wa.
Make a small deal here and there.	Ṣe adehun kekere kan nibi ati nibẹ.
Hold your hand in it.	Mu ọwọ rẹ ninu rẹ.
You will have to make a plan.	Iwọ yoo ni lati ṣe eto kan.
Not at any time.	Ko si ni eyikeyi akoko.
He wondered about their lives before any of this.	O ṣe iyalẹnu nipa igbesi aye wọn ṣaaju eyikeyi eyi.
Everyone involved rejected the proposal.	Gbogbo awọn ti o wa ni kọ imọran naa.
This boy is well known.	A mọ ọmọkunrin yii daradara.
You will have to go through the first thing.	Iwọ yoo ni lati kọja ohun akọkọ.
It is my understanding that the buildings were.	O ti wa ni oye mi ti awọn ile wà.
They haven’t told me anything about it.	Wọn ko ti sọ ohunkohun fun mi nipa rẹ.
Do you have to go?	Ṣe o ni lati lọ?
It doesn’t seem too much.	Ko dabi pupọ ju.
Drink the water.	Mu omi naa.
If you have.	Ti o ba ni.
You just don’t need it anymore.	O kan ko nilo rẹ mọ.
The other three methods do not work as well.	Awọn ọna mẹta miiran ko ṣiṣẹ bi daradara.
At least they will move.	O kere wọn yoo gbe.
Some have no idea why.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti ko ni ero nipa idi ti.
He did not back down.	Ko pada sẹhin.
I do not like this song.	Emi ko fẹran orin yii.
I want my family back.	Mo fe ebi mi pada.
And he will.	Ati pe oun yoo.
You hear the thought behind it.	O gbọ ronu lẹhin rẹ.
The days are over.	Awọn ọjọ ti kọja.
In fact the man was just sitting in a car.	Ni otitọ ọkunrin naa kan joko ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
You don’t need a reason.	O ko nilo idi kan.
That’s pretty much what the agreements are in.	Iyẹn lẹwa pupọ ohun ti awọn adehun wa ni ninu.
It seemed to touch a lot of people.	O dabi enipe o fi ọwọ kan ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
Please, no more.	Jọwọ, ko si mọ.
So come to my area.	Nitorina wa si agbegbe mi.
You know what will happen.	O mọ ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
He could not explain it but he did.	Ko le ṣe alaye rẹ ṣugbọn o ṣe.
Need to know.	Nilo lati mọ.
But marriage is a big thing.	Ṣugbọn igbeyawo jẹ nkan nla.
We will try to reach them on foot.	A yoo gbiyanju lati de ọdọ wọn ni ẹsẹ.
He locked the car door.	O ti ilẹkun ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
It's almost time for bed.	O ti fẹrẹ to akoko fun ibusun.
Year.	Ọdun.
At the very least, that’s how it always works.	O kere ju, iyẹn ni bii o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ nigbagbogbo.
We’re scared, of course.	A n bẹru, dajudaju.
The dog is coming back.	Aja n pada.
All good ways to fly a boat.	Gbogbo awọn ọna ti o dara lati fo ọkọ.
At this point there seemed to be no question.	Ni akoko yii o dabi enipe ko si ibeere.
Nothing will change.	Ko si ohun ti yoo yi.
There is nothing you can learn from such a one.	Ko si ohun ti o le kọ lati iru ọkan.
Can't say what it is.	Ko le sọ ohun ti o jẹ.
This happens sometimes.	Eleyi ṣẹlẹ nigba miiran.
He really likes it.	O fẹran rẹ gaan.
These stories will surprise and amaze you.	Awọn itan wọnyi yoo ṣe iyalẹnu ati iyalẹnu fun ọ.
Not only this matter.	Ko nikan yi ọrọ ti.
People often think you think outside the box.	Eniyan igba ro o ro ita apoti.
They are not lost.	Wọn ko padanu.
Like my sister.	Bi arabinrin mi.
But for him, it was nothing.	Ṣugbọn fun u, kii ṣe nkankan.
I see them.	Mo ri wọn.
I found myself happy to have him there.	Mo ti ri ara mi dun lati ni i nibẹ.
He entered the house and found his seat.	O wọ inu ile naa o si ri ijoko rẹ.
It goes a long way with words.	O ni ọna pupọ pẹlu awọn ọrọ.
I need to be here.	Mo nilo lati wa nibi.
He sat at my table.	O joko ni tabili mi.
But of course there is not much life up there.	Sugbon dajudaju ko si Elo aye soke nibẹ.
I have always played at home.	Mo ti dun ni gbogbo igba ni ile.
The past is irrelevant, and not the future.	Ohun ti o ti kọja ko ṣe pataki, ati pe ko ṣe ọjọ iwaju.
Even when we are not living.	Paapaa nigba ti a ko ba gbe.
But they can’t get us that way.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko le gba wa ni ọna yẹn.
The celebration takes months to plan.	Ayẹyẹ naa gba awọn oṣu lati gbero.
You can remove it.	O le yọ kuro.
The sister died in the morning.	Arabinrin naa ku ni owurọ.
And it is very good that they can call you for help.	Ati pe o dara pupọ pe wọn le pe ọ fun iranlọwọ.
There can be no other reason.	Ko le si idi miiran.
That is the key.	Iyẹn jẹ bọtini.
Go, enjoy.	Lọ, gbadun.
He jumped up from his seat.	O si fo soke lati ijoko rẹ.
But he could not stay indoors.	Sugbon ko le duro ninu ile.
I am making bad decisions.	Mo n ṣe awọn ipinnu buburu.
He had a meeting, he told them.	O ni ipade kan, o sọ fun wọn.
I'm storing things here.	Mo n tọju awọn nkan nibi.
He sat down after a while.	O wa joko lẹhin diẹ.
You have never heard of such.	O ko ti gbọ iru.
Everything else is here.	Gbogbo nkan miiran tun wa nibi.
We talked several times in the end.	A sọrọ ni igba pupọ ni ipari.
I am your information.	Mo je yin alaye.
This method is the only relevant one.	Ọna yii jẹ ọkan ti o yẹ nikan.
As if he had grown up he was only after one thing.	Bi nitori pe o ti dagba o jẹ nikan lẹhin ohun kan.
He loves nothing more than to spend time with us.	Ko nifẹ ohunkohun ju lati lo akoko pẹlu wa.
Maybe something is there, but not found.	Boya ohun kan wa nibẹ, ṣugbọn ko rii.
Are you finished with your lessons?	Njẹ o ti pari pẹlu awọn ẹkọ rẹ?
We need your strength.	A nilo agbara rẹ.
You left your shoes here.	O fi bata rẹ silẹ nibi.
But my brother is not as simple.	Ṣugbọn arakunrin mi ko ni bi o rọrun.
And that takes some time.	Ati pe iyẹn gba akoko diẹ.
It doesn't look like this.	Ko dabi eyi ti o wọ.
Things will come together if you want them to come together.	Awọn nkan yoo wa papọ ti o ba fẹ ki wọn wa papọ.
No problem to friends anything.	Ko si iṣoro si awọn ọrẹ ohunkohun.
Nothing more to say.	Ko si ohun miiran lati sọ.
In our opinion, this information is very important.	Ninu ero wa, alaye yii ṣe pataki gaan.
You know you don’t need to call.	O mọ pe o ko nilo lati pe.
Write as you wish.	Kọ bi o ṣe fẹ.
If you have a problem, just ask!	Ti o ba ni iṣoro kan, kan beere!
You should stop working as expected.	O yẹ ki o duro ṣiṣẹ bi o ti ṣe yẹ.
I am nothing.	Emi ko jẹ nkankan.
It's nearby.	O wa nitosi.
My father was a teacher.	Baba mi jẹ olukọ.
Of course, my car is good.	Dajudaju, ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi dara.
He closed his eyes and shook his head.	O di oju rẹ o si mi ori rẹ.
I have to get up early this morning.	Mo gbọdọ dide ni kutukutu owurọ bayi.
It’s amazing what’s going on in your head.	O jẹ ohun iyanu ohun ti n lọ ni ori rẹ.
Maybe it should have started.	Boya o yẹ ki o ti bẹrẹ.
You think you can do anything !.	O ro pe o le ṣe ohunkohun!.
I tried to change the position of the keys.	Mo ti gbiyanju lati yi awọn ipo ti awọn bọtini.
He was not like that before that night.	Oun ko ri bẹẹ ṣaaju alẹ yẹn.
We have so much power.	A ni agbara pupọ.
We get what we are given, he said.	A gba ohun ti a fi fun wa, o sọ.
Many locals are angry.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ara ilu ni o binu.
Please help if found.	Jọwọ ṣe iranlọwọ ti o ba ti rii.
We do things the way they have to.	A ṣe awọn nkan ni ọna ti wọn ni lati ṣe.
That is another life.	Iyẹn jẹ igbesi aye miiran.
She is a family favorite.	O jẹ ayanfẹ idile.
Learn how to open myself up and let others love me.	Kọ ẹkọ bi o ṣe le ṣii ara mi ati jẹ ki awọn miiran nifẹ mi.
That does not mean.	Ko tumọ si iyẹn.
But even when people get a job, they are not good.	Ṣugbọn paapaa nigba ti awọn eniyan ba gba iṣẹ, wọn ko dara.
So now it’s coming back to me.	Nitorina bayi o n pada si ọdọ mi.
We would like and decide to live here.	A yoo fẹ ki o si pinnu lati gbe nibi.
Think about the place you want to do.	Ronu nipa aaye ti o fẹ ṣe.
I will beat and lose.	Emi yoo lu ati padanu.
But it turns out that he was right.	Sugbon o wa ni jade wipe o ti tọ.

Glad you are here !.	Inu wa dun pe o wa nibi!.
It does not, however, make choices.	Ko ṣe, sibẹsibẹ, ṣe awọn ayanfẹ.
I do not know what to think.	Emi ko mọ kini lati ronu.
They are fast.	Wọn ti yara.
In some cases.	Ni awọn igba miiran.
I think you will be happy to see me.	Mo ro pe inu rẹ yoo dun lati ri mi.
Something is in his eyes.	Nkankan wa ni oju rẹ.
It makes them stand out for others.	O mu ki wọn duro fun awọn miiran.
But I can't see.	Sugbon emi ko le ri.
Or at least let my son have a life to be one.	Tabi o kere ju jẹ ki ọmọ mi ni aye lati jẹ ọkan.
I'm almost out.	Mo ti fẹrẹ jade.
The correct values ​​are given here.	Awọn iye to tọ ni a fun nibi.
Do not talk at all.	Maṣe sọrọ rara.
We talked about anything hot outside.	A sọrọ nipa ohunkohun ti o gbona ni ita.
A bad reason.	Idi buburu kan.
Inside there is a reason.	Ninu nibẹ ni idi.
You know how to tell a story.	O mọ bi o ṣe le sọ itan kan.
That’s their rules, even if you know where you are.	Iyẹn ni awọn ofin wọn, paapaa ti o ba mọ ibiti o wa.
I want everyone to have something for tomorrow.	Mo fẹ ki gbogbo eniyan ni nkankan fun ọla.
Body type.	Iru ara.
From here they traveled by boat.	Lati ibi yii wọn rin nipasẹ ọkọ oju omi.
This area does not have much value.	Agbegbe yii ko ni iye pupọ.
For you it may not.	Fun o o le ma.
Game is not art.	Ere kii ṣe aworan.
Hot water today.	Omi gbona loni.
I am not sure what this means.	Emi ko ni idaniloju kini eyi tumọ si.

These buildings have occupied this space for many years.	Awọn ile wọnyi ti gba aaye yii fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
They are made for.	Wọn ti ṣe fun.
Use that time.	Lo akoko yẹn.
But you want to bring all this to yourself.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ mu gbogbo eyi si ara rẹ.
It should be repeated.	O yẹ ki o tun.
That sounds good.	Iyẹn dabi pe o dara.
Tomorrow may not go well.	Ọla le ma lọ daradara.
It was hot, and we were on fire.	O gbona, ati pe a wa ni ina.
Like this here, up and down.	Bii eyi nibi, oke ati isalẹ.
It was the first time they had met.	O jẹ igba akọkọ ti wọn ti pade.
The eyes are wrong, either.	Awọn oju ko tọ, boya.
All these men are bad.	Gbogbo awọn ọkunrin wọnyi jẹ buburu.
You will not have to build such systems yourself.	Iwọ kii yoo ni lati kọ iru awọn ọna ṣiṣe funrararẹ.
Not that he would need it.	Kii ṣe pe oun yoo nilo rẹ.
They will all be able to fly.	Gbogbo wọn yoo ni anfani lati fo.
I can't believe it's gone.	Emi ko le gbagbọ pe o ti lọ.
It is not possible for intelligent people to do this.	Ko ṣee ṣe fun awọn eniyan ti o ni oye lati ṣe eyi.
Why do you hate him so much?	Kilode ti o korira rẹ bẹ?
We know and understand that.	A mọ ati oye iyẹn.
For me to do that must be bad.	Fun mi lati ṣe pe o gbọdọ jẹ buburu.
He hopes he does not.	O nireti pe ko ni.
I have stuck to my passion.	Mo ti duro si ifẹ mi.
Take care of my baby.	Tọju ọmọ mi.
She thought about it but was surprised.	O ro nipa rẹ ṣugbọn o ti ya.
But he is not my husband.	Ṣugbọn oun kii ṣe ọkọ mi.
This is a bad deal.	Eyi jẹ adehun ti ko dara.
Not my favorite thing.	Ko ayanfẹ mi ohun.
For a while now.	Fun igba diẹ bayi.
You have to touch your heart.	O ni lati fi ọwọ kan ọkan rẹ.
I explained them and that was it.	Mo ṣe alaye wọn ati pe iyẹn ni.
Get physical and clean the house.	Gba ti ara ati nu ile naa.
This is not about you.	Eyi kii ṣe nipa rẹ.
He loves himself past his mistakes.	O nifẹ ara rẹ ti o ti kọja awọn aṣiṣe rẹ.
He saw everything.	O si ri gbogbo ohun.
However, that will not be how others see it.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn kii yoo jẹ bi awọn miiran ṣe rii.
We cannot take years to learn.	A ko le gba awọn ọdun lati kọ ẹkọ.
You have already called.	O ti pe tẹlẹ.
It may even have already been.	O le paapaa ti jẹ tẹlẹ.

I'll try that way.	Emi yoo gbiyanju ọna yẹn.
It does not look like it.	Ko dabi rẹ.
How long will this take?	Igba melo ni eyi yoo gba?
Here is the explanation.	Eyi ni alaye naa.
Of their father.	Ti baba wọn ni.
Good on some things.	Dara lori diẹ ninu awọn ohun.
And years will pass.	Ati ọdun yoo kọja.
I can't live without this device right now.	Emi ko le gbe laisi ẹrọ yii ni bayi.

It belongs to everyone.	O je ti gbogbo eniyan.
He refuses to do it morning and night.	O kọ lati ṣe ni owurọ ati alẹ.
All on your own.	Gbogbo lori ara rẹ.
But, in my opinion, you are like my sister.	Ṣugbọn, loju mi, iwọ dabi arabinrin mi.
I dropped.	Mo ju silẹ.
One person died.	Eniyan kan ti ku.
I stopped but did not return.	Mo duro sugbon ko pada.
He does not like children.	Ko fẹran awọn ọmọde.
Your word means something.	Ọrọ rẹ tumọ si nkankan.
You will understand that will help you to keep well.	Iwọ yoo ni oye ti yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ lati tọju daradara.
We need their help.	A nilo iranlọwọ wọn.
You do not see it.	O ko wo i.

She's happy, she said.	Inu re dun, o ni.
He shook his head.	O si pa ori re.
In this, perhaps, it is like many others.	Ninu eyi, boya, o dabi ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran.
But what will they look like ?.	Ṣugbọn kini wọn yoo dabi?.
This is my favorite time of the day.	Eyi ni akoko ayanfẹ mi ti ọjọ.
There is no cost to you.	Ko si iye owo fun ọ.
So much more.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ diẹ sii.
We do because we have to.	A ṣe nitori pe a ni lati.
It will take them a day or two.	Yoo gba wọn ni ọjọ kan tabi meji.
Others, it depends.	Awọn miiran, o da.
He is not hungry.	Ebi ko pa oun.
The reason for this is not clear.	Idi ti eyi ko ṣe akiyesi.
But you have already forgotten it.	Ṣugbọn o ti gbagbe rẹ tẹlẹ.
You can also do this.	O tun le ṣe eyi.
But one thing is for sure.	Ṣugbọn ohun kan jẹ ki o yi ọkan rẹ pada.
Nothing.	Ko si ohun ti o wa.
And it was great to look at even.	Ati pe o jẹ nla lati wo paapaa.
We drive on the road.	A wakọ ni opopona.
He could not take any pictures.	Ko le ya aworan eyikeyi.
I am not one of the players.	Emi ko ọkan ninu awọn ẹrọ orin.
My room is always hot.	Yara mi gbona nigbagbogbo.
In a tree.	Ni igi kan.
I keep my word that he will take my letter.	Mo pa ọrọ mi mọ pe oun yoo gba lẹta mi.
But it is also interesting.	Sugbon o tun awon.
Suitable for any home or office.	Dara fun eyikeyi ile tabi ọfiisi.

He thought he would be fine for a while.	O ro pe oun yoo dara fun akoko kan.

What the city is, you can get away with.	Ohun ti ilu ni, o le gba kuro.
We need a few things.	A nilo awọn nkan diẹ.

I'm glad she was there to help the little boy.	Inu mi dun pe o wa nibẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọmọkunrin kekere naa.

Maybe some water will help.	Boya diẹ ninu omi yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.

We have trouble for a while.	A ni wahala ni igba diẹ.
Not for the faint of heart.	Ko fun eniyan ni o kere.

Just do it.	O kan ṣe.
Or at least it used to be.	Tabi ni tabi o kere o lo lati wa ni.
And that's all there.	Ati awọn ti o ni gbogbo nibẹ.
I’m not saying you have to stay in bed.	Emi ko sọ pe o ni lati duro lori ibusun.
Someone wants.	Ẹnikan fẹ.
You have to know everything.	O ni lati mọ ohun gbogbo.
They are both tired.	Awon mejeeji ti re.
Or that something changed.	Tabi pe ohun kan yipada.
You can only say what you notice.	O le sọ ohun ti o ṣe akiyesi nikan.
Maybe he was too old for me.	Boya o ti dagba ju fun mi.
You have to hurry.	O ni lati yara.
Go down that road, you will find the station.	Lọ si isalẹ ọna yẹn, iwọ yoo wa ibudo naa.
The material is for him not me.	Ohun elo naa jẹ fun u kii ṣe emi.
But just for a moment she sat up.	Sugbon o kan fun akoko kan o joko soke.
An application is a machine for making something.	Ohun elo jẹ ẹrọ fun ṣiṣe nkan kan.
What a wonderful friend, and what a beautiful board.	Ohun ti iyanu ọrẹ, ati ohun ti a lẹwa ọkọ.
It lets people express themselves.	O jẹ ki eniyan sọ ara wọn.
The verse is also there.	Ẹsẹ naa tun wa nibẹ.
It is good to have them in.	O dara lati ni wọn ninu.
Just everywhere.	O kan ni gbogbo ibi.
I really like this picture.	Mo nifẹ aworan yii gaan.
You can't believe what you see.	O ko le gbagbọ ohun ti o ri.
You have your rules.	O ni awọn ofin rẹ.
It is your car.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ ni.
Her husband should not be outside for himself.	Ọkọ rẹ ko yẹ ki o wa ni ita fun ara rẹ.
Below is what we have.	Ni isalẹ ni ohun ti a ni.
I have to keep.	Mo ni lati tọju.
It really came to me.	O wa si mi gaan.
I want you to come back, but you can't.	Mo fe ki o pada wa, sugbon ko se.
He is cleaning the house.	O n nu ile.
I can not write on my work.	Emi ko le kọ lori iṣẹ mi.
I also have a daughter.	Mo tun ni ọmọbirin kan.
You have rejected that idea.	O ti kọ ero yẹn.
Accepting it causes you harm.	Ti o gba ni o fa ipalara rẹ.
However, the story does not end there.	Sibẹsibẹ, itan naa ko pari nibẹ.
All of this is true, and no one is serious.	Gbogbo eyi jẹ otitọ, ati pe ko si ọkan ti o ṣe pataki.
Most of the time they do this.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba wọn ṣe eyi.
It is very easy to operate.	O rọrun pupọ lati ṣiṣẹ.
Their eyes widened as they slept.	Oju wọn ṣi silẹ bi wọn ti n sun.
It has some minor injuries.	O ni diẹ ninu awọn ipalara kekere.
It was worth the time, of course.	O tọ ni akoko, dajudaju.
Not to keep anyone away, but to keep yourself inside.	Kii ṣe lati pa ẹnikẹni mọ, ṣugbọn lati tọju ararẹ sinu.
You have to go out a lot more.	O ni lati jade pupọ diẹ.
This, however, is not true.	Eyi, sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe otitọ.
This time it looked amazing.	Ni akoko yii o dabi iyanu.
It is a story not only of fire but of water.	O jẹ itan kii ṣe ti ina nikan ṣugbọn omi.
Power is not there.	Agbara ko si nibẹ.
But they are not always like this.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii ṣe nigbagbogbo bi eyi.
Tell me everything you said.	Sọ gbogbo ọrọ ti o sọ fun ọ fun mi.
Of course it is.	Dajudaju o jẹ.
Everyone had a wonderful time.	Gbogbo eniyan ni akoko iyanu.
He loves the old ways of doing things.	O fẹran awọn ọna atijọ ti ṣiṣe awọn nkan.
I love football.	Mo nifẹ bọọlu.
Everything has to be done well.	Ohun gbogbo ni lati ṣee ṣe daradara.
However, good news.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn iroyin ti o dara.
All was really still.	Gbogbo wà gan ṣi.

Do not touch old materials.	Maṣe fi ọwọ kan awọn ohun elo atijọ.
I'm not happy.	Emi ko ṣe dun.
That's what we're going to do.	Ohun ti a yoo ṣe niyẹn.
They just want a better life.	Wọn kan fẹ igbesi aye to dara julọ.
You are wrong about me.	O ṣe aṣiṣe nipa mi.
My word is gone.	Ọrọ mi ti lọ.
He was like his own father.	O dabi baba ara rẹ.
Office offices are nearby.	Awọn ọfiisi ile-iṣẹ wa nitosi.
She loves the baby.	O nifẹ ọmọ naa.
I will not say here.	Emi kii yoo sọ nibi.
In fact, much more can be said.	Ni otitọ, pupọ diẹ sii ni a le sọ.
Many have given up.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ti fun soke.
The family dies.	Ebi ku.
We talked and that was about it.	A ti sọrọ ati awọn ti o wà nipa o.
There is nothing to think about.	Ko si nkankan lati ro ero.
She’s trying to decide whether to say something to him, or not.	O n gbiyanju lati pinnu boya lati sọ nkankan fun u, tabi rara.
The group continued on their journey.	Ẹgbẹ naa tẹsiwaju lori irin-ajo wọn.
This is great, great stuff.	Eyi jẹ nla, nkan nla.
Stories of a man walking through time.	Awọn itan ti ọkunrin kan ti o rin nipasẹ akoko.
I can only ask.	Mo le beere nikan.
Obviously it is not easy and you need to put in the work.	O han ni pe ko rọrun ati pe o nilo lati fi sinu iṣẹ naa.
I killed him as a man, brother.	Mo pa a bi ọkunrin kan, arakunrin.
Maybe things will start to change.	Boya ohun yoo bẹrẹ lati yi.
Fire can get out of the water.	Ina le gba lati omi.
I pulled away.	Mo fa kuro.
And it is amazing.	Ati pe o jẹ iyalẹnu.
Just wait until your dad hears about this!	O kan duro titi baba rẹ yoo gbọ nipa eyi!
Good and easy.	O dara ati rọrun.
We want to let it stand.	A fẹ lati jẹ ki o duro jẹ.
We need rain.	A nilo ojo.
Our children will not understand.	Awọn ọmọ wa ko ni loye.
In fact, it is not at all.	Ni otitọ, kii ṣe iyẹn rara.
Everyone knew he would be there.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ pe oun yoo wa nibẹ.
Or two minutes.	Tabi iṣẹju meji.
We did not see any of the faces.	A ko ri eyikeyi ninu awọn oju.
This is appropriate.	Eleyi jẹ yẹ.
I must have some time to talk to you.	Mo gbọdọ ni akoko diẹ lati ba ọ sọrọ.
His wife is angry.	Iyawo re binu.
It is not down there.	Ko ti wa ni isalẹ nibẹ.
I burned both of them.	Mo sun awon mejeeji.
I just do not know what to do.	Mo kan ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
Back with her husband.	Pada pẹlu ọkọ rẹ.
I want to read again.	Mo fẹ lati ka lẹẹkansi.
Or they don’t want to.	Tabi wọn ko fẹ.
It seemed a long time.	O dabi enipe igba pipẹ.
And even that may not be enough.	Ati paapaa iyẹn le ma to.
That is beyond me.	Ti o ju mi.
He stood behind her.	O duro lẹhin rẹ.
Something has come before that.	Ohun kan ti wa ṣaaju iyẹn.
It gives this person a lot of energy.	O n fun eniyan yii ni agbara pupọ.
Something bad.	Nkankan buburu.
You have once we get married by making, everything will be fine.	O ni ni kete ti a ba ṣe igbeyawo nipasẹ ṣiṣe, ohun gbogbo yoo dara.

And you can have them.	Ati pe o le ni wọn.

Two of them are with him.	Meji ninu wọn wa pẹlu rẹ.

You need someone to listen to you.	O nilo ẹnikan lati gbọ tirẹ.
You need to get a job.	O nilo lati gba iṣẹ kan.
It is difficult for me to see, to understand the words.	O n nira fun mi lati rii, lati loye awọn ọrọ.

Thinking of something like this too.	Ti n ronu nipa nkan bii eyi paapaa.

This is what we are about and we do well.	Eyi ni ohun ti a jẹ nipa ati pe a ṣe daradara.
Obviously, this is costly.	O han ni, eyi jẹ iye owo.
He drove another minute or two after that.	O wakọ iṣẹju miiran tabi meji lẹhin eyi.
We will do what we expect to find.	A yoo ṣe ohun ti a reti lati wa.
We didn’t live where we were when we left home.	A ko gbe ibi ti a ti ṣe nigbati o lọ kuro ni ile.
Buy a house.	Ra ile kan.

Unwanted vehicle.	Ọkọ ti ko fẹ.
I agree with both.	Mo gba pẹlu awọn mejeeji.
This situation should be considered soon in the coming test.	Ipo yii yẹ ki o ṣe akiyesi laipẹ ni idanwo ti n bọ.
But that is unlikely to happen.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣeeṣe lati ṣẹlẹ.
Remember when they started in a year.	Ranti nigbati wọn bẹrẹ ni ọdun kan.
I’ve seen everything but those last moments.	Mo ti rii ohun gbogbo ṣugbọn awọn akoko to kẹhin yẹn.
Or they don’t think about it.	Tabi wọn ko ronu nipa rẹ.
This has been a problem for years.	Eyi ti jẹ iṣoro fun awọn ọdun.
Tell your mother.	Sọ fun iya rẹ.
Everyone here is up to something.	Gbogbo eniyan nibi ni soke si nkankan.
When you receive a letter, open the door.	Nigbati o ba gba lẹta kan, ṣii ilẹkun.
Simple devices have a simple purpose.	Awọn ẹrọ ti o rọrun ni idi ti o rọrun.
Around should one person.	Ni ayika yẹ eniyan kan.
She did everything she could to help.	O ṣe gbogbo ohun ti o le ṣe lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
There must be a better way.	Ọna ti o dara julọ gbọdọ wa.
The news turned out to be true.	Awọn iroyin ti jade lati jẹ otitọ.
At least for us.	O kere si wa.
We did not see the baby while he was there.	A ko ri ọmọ nigba ti o wa nibẹ.
I have someone watching it.	Mo ni ẹnikan ti n wo e.
But it is more than that.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
I love you so much, my child.	Mo nifẹ rẹ pupọ, ọmọ mi.
Cities will have to be big cities.	Awọn ilu yoo ni lati jẹ ilu nla.
You can walk to the city from here.	O le rin si ilu lati ibi.
We can all learn something new.	Gbogbo wa le kọ nkan tuntun.
Give us a better life.	Fun wa ni aye to dara julọ.
People are here because of books.	Awọn eniyan wa nibi nitori awọn iwe.
Things will stay the same.	Awọn nkan yoo duro kanna.
A picture last week.	Aworan kan ni ọsẹ to kọja.
He heard it.	O gbọ rẹ.
After that we always give you another world.	Lẹhin iyẹn nigbagbogbo a fun ọ ni aye miiran.
I want to buy with my own money.	Mo fẹ lati ra pẹlu owo ti ara mi.
Do not talk until we have talked to.	Maṣe sọrọ titi ti a ba sọrọ si.
Our on the working class is to move too.	Wa lori awọn ṣiṣẹ kilasi ni lati gbe ju.
It’s just one of many.	O kan jẹ ọkan ninu ọpọlọpọ.
But they did nothing to us.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko ṣe ohunkohun si wa.
Feeling like rain.	Rilara bi ojo.
O ga.	O ga.
You want to read in a book.	O fẹ ka ninu iwe kan.
You need to prove yourself.	O nilo lati fi ara rẹ han.
So it is something you can, when you can.	Nitorina o jẹ ohun ti o le, nigbati o ba le.
They never told me anything about it.	Wọn ko sọ ohunkohun fun mi nipa rẹ rara.
You have to work with everyone.	O ni lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu gbogbo eniyan.
In fact, he can’t remember what he was talking about either.	Ni otitọ, ko le ranti ohun ti o ti sọrọ nipa boya.
It is not an easy task.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
That is a good way to look.	Iyẹn jẹ ọna ti o dara lati wo.
The sun has set.	Oorun ti lọ silẹ.
She lives in an old town.	O ngbe ni ilu atijọ kan.
I accept the idea.	Mo gba ero naa.
No, not a face.	Rara, kii ṣe oju kan.
But others may need to learn.	Ṣugbọn awọn miiran le nilo lati kọ.
It may not be long.	Ko le pẹ.
People love this place and are there here.	Eniyan ni ife ibi yi ati ki o ti wa ni nibẹ nibi.
I waited for him to start again.	Mo duro fun u lati bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
It takes some time to understand your purpose.	O gba akoko diẹ lati loye idi rẹ.
Let's find another way to do this.	Jẹ ki a wa ọna miiran lati ṣiṣẹ eyi.
Do not use for children under two years of age.	Ma ṣe lo fun awọn ọmọde labẹ ọdun meji.
That is hard work for a student of his or her obvious understanding,	Iyẹn jẹ iṣẹ lile fun ọmọ ile-iwe ti oye oye rẹ ti o han gbangba,
I have an objective.	Emi ni ohun idi.
I hate it for this.	Mo korira rẹ fun eyi.
I have your name, it is in the program.	Mo ni orukọ rẹ, o wa ninu eto naa.
I think they made a mistake.	Mo ro pe wọn ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
You need to pay attention.	O nilo lati san akiyesi.
You get it.	O gba ko.
But no one knows how much it is.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ iye ti o jẹ.
Everyone is past.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o ti kọja.
Sometimes, just walk away.	Nigba miiran, o kan rin kuro.
He doesn't know anymore.	Ko mọ mọ.
That's what dogs do.	Ohun ti awọn aja ṣe niyẹn.
It is easy for people to read and write.	O rọrun fun eniyan lati ka ati kọ.
It is better not to stay here.	A o dara ki a ma duro nibi.
We have on that.	A ni lori wipe.
I'll have to go.	Emi yoo ni lati lọ.
So please let me know what you think.	Nitorina jọwọ jẹ ki mi mọ ohun ti o ro.
Any injury caused by.	Eyikeyi ipalara ṣẹlẹ nipasẹ.
Please let it work out for them.	Jọwọ jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ jade fun wọn.
It seemed like the question of whether he would sleep all night.	O dabi enipe o jẹ ibeere boya oun yoo sun ni gbogbo alẹ oni.
But they did not tell him.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko sọ fun u.
I wonder what brought this love.	Mo ṣe iyalẹnu kini o mu ifẹ yii wa.
He quickly looked around the room.	O yara wo yara naa.
As we grow older, our foot problems grow with us.	Bi a ti n dagba, awọn iṣoro ẹsẹ wa dagba pẹlu wa.
He is in excellent physical condition.	O wa ni ipo ti ara to dara julọ.
From another place it is not possible.	Lati ibi miiran ko ṣee ṣe.
Good for drinks, less for food.	O dara fun ohun mimu, kere si fun ounjẹ.
He could not tell her.	Ko le sọ fun u.
The man had two other passengers in the car.	Ọkunrin naa ni awọn ero meji miiran ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
I could see his mother in his eyes.	Mo le ri iya rẹ ni oju rẹ.
Those big hands.	Awọn ọwọ nla yẹn.
It's a big problem.	Iṣoro nla ni.
Absolutely not.	Rara rara ko le jẹ.
And it’s very possible to even talk.	Ati pe o ṣee ṣe pupọ lati sọrọ paapaa.
We think of things that are not yet finished.	A ronu nipa awọn nkan ti ko tii pari.
But he took it and went upstairs.	Ṣugbọn o mu u lọ ati pe o jade ni oke.
This dog has been stolen.	A ti ji aja yii.
I would even say we are happy.	Emi yoo paapaa sọ pe inu wa dun.
He has even grown.	O ti dagba paapaa.
He could not begin to think what to say.	Ko le bẹrẹ lati ronu ohun ti yoo sọ.
Let him talk to me.	Jẹ ki o sọrọ si mi.
Everyone sat in their seats.	Gbogbo eniyan joko si awọn ijoko wọn.
It's best to go.	O dara julọ ki o lọ.
There is a good picture of the two here.	Nibẹ ni kan ti o dara aworan ti awọn meji nibi.
I read a lot of books.	Mo ka ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe.
But some things were pretty good.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu awọn ohun wà lẹwa ti o dara.
We walk back to the future.	A rin sẹhin si ojo iwaju.
And what someone needs.	Ati ohun ti ẹnikan nilo.
People are getting out of the house now.	Awọn eniyan n jade ni ile bayi.
But everything has changed.	Ṣugbọn ohun gbogbo ti yipada.
I have never seen anything like this before.	Emi ko tii ri iru eyi tẹlẹ.
He was an amazing man.	O jẹ ọkunrin iyanu.
That, to me, is important.	Iyẹn, si mi, ṣe pataki.
Everyone is watching.	Gbogbo eniyan n wo.
I look away.	Mo wo kuro.
Okay, my dad is right about it.	O dara, baba mi ni otitọ nipa rẹ.
Music helps me to remember and to forget.	Orin ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi lati ranti ati lati gbagbe.
We are flying.	A ti fo.
He looked at the two men.	O wo awọn ọkunrin meji naa.
So you never know.	Nitorina o ko mọ.
Many people say it is their favorite.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan sọ pe o jẹ ayanfẹ wọn.
Not sure if it is even possible.	Ko daju boya o ṣee ṣe paapaa.
You can not hit the device.	O ko le lu ẹrọ naa.
I don’t have anyone to go with.	Emi ko ni ẹnikan lati lọ pẹlu.
You have done it yourself.	O ti ṣe funrararẹ.
Make room for whatever comes up.	Ṣe yara fun ohunkohun ti o ba wa ni oke.
Without going into details I will try to tell you why.	Laisi lilọ sinu awọn alaye Emi yoo gbiyanju lati sọ idi rẹ fun ọ.
I am good at this.	Emi dara ni eyi.
The problem is internal.	Iṣoro naa jẹ inu.
If you have paid any attention you have seen what happened.	Ti o ba ti san akiyesi eyikeyi o ti rii ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
The field is yours.	Awọn aaye jẹ tirẹ.
You have taken everything from me.	O ti gba ohun gbogbo lọwọ mi.
This is just what we want.	Eyi jẹ ohun ti a fẹ nikan.
I missed that one.	Mo padanu ọkan yẹn.
It means more money.	O tumọ si owo diẹ sii.
They let me get up last night.	Wọn jẹ ki mi dide ni alẹ ana.
I started to think maybe it was a good time.	Mo bẹrẹ lati ro pe boya o je kan ti o dara akoko.
Just go up and down.	O kan lọ soke ati isalẹ.
The program is in place.	Eto naa wa ni ipo.
I was afraid of him.	Mo bẹru lati ọdọ rẹ.
I began to believe in myself.	Mo ti bẹrẹ lati gbagbọ funrararẹ.
I can’t really be with him and do much.	Emi ko le gan wa pẹlu rẹ ki o si ṣe Elo.
You can leave that.	O le fi iyẹn silẹ.
Others continue to come back for more.	Awọn miiran tẹsiwaju lati pada fun diẹ sii.
I have told anyone who will listen.	Mo ti sọ fun ẹnikẹni ti yoo gbọ.
It is pretty worth it to me.	O ti wa ni lẹwa tọ fun mi.
They let it out.	Wọn ti jẹ ki o jade.
We will see you at dinner.	A yoo ri ọ ni ounjẹ alẹ.
Make it easy for them, don’t you know.	Ṣe o rọrun fun wọn, ṣe o ko mọ.
I can't decide what's in it.	Emi ko le pinnu ohun ti o wa ninu rẹ.
I can go to this.	Mo le lo si eyi.
I think maybe something is wrong with me.	Mo ro pe boya ohun ti ko tọ si pẹlu mi.
There is a lot of work going on in it right now.	Iṣẹ pupọ wa ti o wa sinu rẹ ni bayi.
Who says you pay money.	Ẹniti o sọ pe o san owo.
But he was not sure how to make it happen.	Ṣugbọn o ko ni idaniloju bi o ṣe le jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
This in itself is important.	Eyi funrararẹ ṣe pataki.
I do not understand it at all.	Emi ko loye rẹ rara.
We should remember that.	A yẹ ki o ranti pe.
You should ask how you can do this to him.	O yẹ ki o beere bi o ṣe le ṣe eyi si i.
He enjoys working in the garden.	O gbadun ṣiṣẹ ninu ọgba.
I love music.	Mo nifẹ orin ṣiṣe.
It was for their own good, he said to himself.	O jẹ fun ara wọn ti o dara, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
These devices are excellent.	Awọn ẹrọ wọnyi dara julọ.
In fact, most people don’t.	Ni otitọ, ọpọlọpọ eniyan ko ṣe.
I still have some light.	Mo tun ni ina diẹ.
I want you to find it.	Mo fẹ ki o wa rẹ.
We are interested in it.	A nifẹ lori rẹ.
And it can be.	Ati pe o le jẹ.
This time, he was also invited to complete his work.	Ni akoko yii, o tun pe e lati pari iṣẹ rẹ.
Sorry, there is no reason to read for yourself.	Ma binu, ko si idi kan lati ka fun ara rẹ.
He will let the machine work and everything.	Oun yoo jẹ ki ẹrọ naa ṣiṣẹ ati ohun gbogbo.
There every morning.	Nibẹ ni gbogbo owurọ.
Let's leave it there.	Jẹ ki a fi silẹ nibẹ.
We have seen him become a man.	A ti rii pe o di eniyan.
We know some but not enough.	A mọ diẹ ninu awọn sugbon ko to.
The old friend of the man was reading the newspaper.	Ọrẹ atijọ ọkunrin naa n ka iwe iroyin naa.
The man said it was raining.	Ọkunrin naa sọ pe ojo n bọ.
Take me a picture of your house.	Ya mi aworan ile rẹ.
They never met me face to face.	Wọn ko pade mi ni oju.
And my best friend never spoke to me again.	Ati pe ọrẹ mi to dara julọ ko tun ba mi sọrọ.
Sorry not enough this time.	Ma binu ko to ni akoko yii.
He did the best thing in it.	O ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ ninu rẹ.
Some small.	Diẹ ninu awọn kekere.
But this will take some time.	Ṣugbọn eyi yoo gba igba diẹ.
And there are more.	Ati pe diẹ sii wa.
History remembers it well.	Itan ranti rẹ daradara.
He was not afraid.	Ko bẹru.
And he was very angry.	Ati pe o binu pupọ.
There seems to be no place in this world.	O dabi pe ko si aye ni ibi.
What a wonderful first year.	Ohun ti a iyanu odun akọkọ.
Anyone who has a team knows how hard this can be.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ni ẹgbẹ kan mọ bi eyi le ṣe le to.
He was a little friend.	O jẹ ọrẹ kekere kan.
I missed it so much.	Mo padanu rẹ bẹ.
It is a matter of what makes me happy.	O jẹ ọrọ ti ohun ti o mu inu mi dun.
Children like these do not listen.	Awọn ọmọde bi wọnyi ko gbọ.
You go over.	O lọ kọja.
He walked on.	O rin lori.
I have never thought of that before.	Emi ko ronu nipa iyẹn tẹlẹ.
There may be several reasons for this.	Awọn idi pupọ le wa fun eyi.
But my mother had been told about our thoughts.	Ṣugbọn a ti sọ fun iya mi nipa awọn ero wa.
Sounds beautiful, he thought.	Ohun lẹwa, o ro.
If you can not get.	Ti ko ba le gba.
The problem is, there are so many.	Iṣoro naa ni, ọpọlọpọ rẹ wa.
Not that we did that.	Kii ṣe pe a ṣe iyẹn.
They do not deserve this.	Wọn ko yẹ eyi.
It can be anything or anyone.	O le jẹ ohunkohun tabi ẹnikẹni.
A year before that.	Ọdun kan ṣaaju iyẹn.
This takes some time, especially with your help.	Eyi gba akoko diẹ, paapaa pẹlu iranlọwọ rẹ.
It’s not a way out to believe me.	Kii ṣe ọna lati jade gba mi gbọ.
We are always told that we are important.	Nigbagbogbo a sọ fun wa pe a jẹ pataki.
No need to think about it, you are convinced.	Ko nilo lati ronu nipa rẹ, o ni idaniloju.
You need to.	O nilo.
Just a matter of time.	O kan ọrọ kan ti akoko.
Children can have many brothers.	Awọn ọmọde le ni ọpọlọpọ awọn arakunrin.
Start your own group.	Bẹrẹ ẹgbẹ tirẹ.
You have come to this point many times.	O ti wa si aaye yii ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
Get your heads in the game.	Gba awọn ori rẹ ni ere.
But they are not the whole picture.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii ṣe gbogbo aworan naa.
I am on my own now.	Mo wa lori ara mi bayi.
No front, but behind it.	Ko si iwaju, ṣugbọn lẹhin rẹ.
Ask him, he will come.	Beere fun u, yoo wa.
I had a good time with them.	Mo ti lo akoko ti o dara pẹlu wọn.
It hurts a lot.	O ni ipalara buburu.
A young world to shoes.	A odo aye si bata.
We need to take care of the environment.	A nilo lati tọju ayika.
I will be with my friends.	Emi yoo wa pẹlu awọn ọrẹ mi.
Here it is.	Eyi ni.
Or too much water.	Tabi omi pupọ.
The man noticed the details.	Ọkunrin naa ṣe akiyesi awọn alaye.
Not what was behind it.	Ko ohun ti o wà lẹhin.
I can’t go through everything now.	Emi ko le lọ nipasẹ gbogbo nkan bayi.
Not that you expect anything in return.	Kii ṣe pe o nireti ohunkohun.
Police were in his office yesterday.	Ọlọpa wa ni ọfiisi rẹ lana.
Now, if that’s what you want to say, fine.	Bayi, ti o ba jẹ ohun ti o fẹ sọ, o dara.
I have not been here before.	Emi ko ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
You have to live your life, feeling it through and through.	O gbọdọ ṣe igbesi aye rẹ, rilara rẹ nipasẹ ati nipasẹ.
It does not seem to matter.	O dabi pe ko ṣe akiyesi.
We will ask you.	A yoo beere rẹ.
Okay that's right.	O dara iyẹn tọ.
The police station will open in the morning.	Ile-iṣẹ ọlọpa yoo ṣii ni owurọ.
Or your child.	Tabi ọmọ rẹ.
Or his mother could not help him.	Tabi iya rẹ ko le ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
They don’t want to know and they don’t want you to know either.	Wọn ko fẹ lati mọ ati pe wọn ko fẹ ki o mọ boya.
Work less and play more.	Ṣiṣẹ kere si ki o mu ṣiṣẹ diẹ sii.
Three months now.	Oṣu mẹta bayi.
However this issue is left for future projects.	Sibẹsibẹ a fi ọrọ yii silẹ fun awọn iṣẹ iwaju.
You do not walk away from this.	Iwọ ko rin kuro ninu eyi.
It’s not your first job.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ akọkọ rẹ.
There is a service.	Iṣẹ kan wa.
I will send you your picture.	Emi yoo fi aworan rẹ ranṣẹ si ọ.
He left in an hour.	O fi silẹ ni wakati kan.
That is a mistake because it is not my money to drink.	Iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe nitori pe kii ṣe owo mi lati mu.
He took the road.	O mu ọna lọ.
Trying to get away with that, he hesitated.	Ni idanwo lati lọ kuro ni iyẹn, o ṣiyemeji.
I tried everything to bring them out, but it did not work.	Mo gbiyanju ohun gbogbo lati mu wọn jade, ṣugbọn ko ṣiṣẹ.
We want to make sure this does not happen again.	A fẹ lati rii daju wipe eyi ko ni ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
It is a picture of an office.	O jẹ aworan ti ọfiisi kan.
Everyone at the table was terrified.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o wa ni tabili ni o bẹru.
They do not expect everyone to get the same.	Wọn ko nireti pe gbogbo eniyan yoo gba kanna.
Cut yourself off.	Ge ara rẹ isinmi.
Can't find anything but money.	Ko le ri nkankan sugbon owo.
He went out into the side garden.	O jade lọ sinu ọgba ẹgbẹ.
I’m not completely sure how we can, but it ’s there.	Emi ko ni idaniloju patapata bi a ṣe le, ṣugbọn o wa nibẹ.
He could not get it out of his mind.	Ko le gba a kuro ninu ọkan rẹ.
People are going to move out.	Eniyan ti wa ni lilọ lati gbe jade.
Who could they be, if they had not died that summer.	Tani wọn le jẹ, ti wọn ko ba ku ni igba ooru yẹn.
I am not sure whether it will pay me or not.	Emi ko da mi loju boya yoo san fun mi tabi rara.
I will live with you from then on.	Emi yoo gbe pẹlu mi lati igba naa.
Your children know.	Awọn ọmọ rẹ mọ.
This, of course, should not happen.	Eyi, dajudaju, ko gbọdọ ṣẹlẹ.
We asked, they did.	A beere, wọn ṣe.
I don’t think most people know.	Emi ko ro pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan mọ.
Man, you need to say.	Eniyan, o nilo lati sọ.
We can talk.	A le sọrọ.
She grew up as her mother.	O ti dagba bi iya rẹ.
Always be observant and fearful.	Ṣe akiyesi nigbagbogbo ati bẹru.
I have time.	Mo ni akoko.
I can't do it.	Emi ko le ṣe si i.
She hopes to have her own children one day.	O nireti lati ni awọn ọmọ tirẹ ni ọjọ kan.
I moved but did not learn.	Mo ti gbe ṣugbọn ko kọ ẹkọ.
Especially at meal time.	Ni pataki ni akoko ounjẹ.
I have never seen this before.	Emi ko rii eyi tẹlẹ.
I want to sit down and think for a while.	Mo fẹ lati joko si isalẹ ki o ronu fun diẹ.
For their families.	Fun idile wọn.
Both sides did not.	Awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji ko ṣe.
I think they felt bad.	Mo ro pe won ro buburu.
But first you have to get your daughter back.	Ṣugbọn akọkọ o ni lati gba ọmọbirin rẹ pada.
Together they can be art.	Papọ wọn le jẹ aworan.
He didn’t want to have to travel out of town again.	Ko fẹ lati ni lati rin irin-ajo jade ni ilu lẹẹkansi.
John did not like the new system.	John ko fẹran eto tuntun naa.
And everyone who met him loved it.	Ati pe gbogbo awọn ti o pade rẹ fẹran rẹ.
The same old story.	Kanna atijọ itan.
He sat down at the table.	O si joko lori tabili.
This tea is too sweet.	Tii yii dun ju.
This guy just enjoys it !.	Arakunrin yii kan n gbadun!.
He wants a house.	O fe ile kan.
Years have passed.	Awọn ọdun ti kọja.
I have no problem talking about it.	Emi ko ni iṣoro lati sọrọ nipa rẹ.
That is not to say that these people are wrong.	Iyẹn kii ṣe lati sọ pe awọn eniyan wọnyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
Should have.	Yẹ ki o ni.
Everything matters.	Gbogbo nkan ṣe pataki.
It was good they ate a lot.	O dara wọn jẹun pupọ.
So think it over.	Nitorina ro o lori.
You have to come up with something better.	O ni lati wa pẹlu nkan ti o dara julọ.
Maybe they will go.	Boya wọn yoo lọ.
Do not lose heat if you have equipment.	Maṣe padanu ooru ti o ba ni ohun elo.
I want you back, of course.	Mo fe ki o pada, dajudaju.
He said it was personal.	O sọ pe o jẹ ti ara ẹni.
Call now to let it be yours !!!.	Pe ni bayi lati jẹ ki o jẹ tirẹ !!!.
See ourselves and what might be the matter.	Ri ara wa ati ohun ti o le jẹ ọrọ.
He took his place at the table.	O si mu rẹ aaye ni tabili.
I want to die.	Mo fe ku.
I love the area and the environment there.	Mo nifẹ agbegbe ati ayika nibẹ.
And it's worth it.	Ati pe o tọ.
She decided to go, decided not to.	O pinnu lati lọ, pinnu lati ma ṣe.
They have more to say for themselves.	Wọn ni diẹ lati sọ fun ara wọn.
I'll see.	Emi yoo rii.
Another reason he may not love her.	Idi miiran ti ko le nifẹ rẹ.
It seems to have worked.	O dabi pe o ti ṣiṣẹ.
It probably will be.	O jasi yoo jẹ.
Decide what you want to do and run.	Ṣiṣe ipinnu ohun ti o fẹ ṣe ati ṣiṣe.
I'll call you back with details.	Emi yoo pe ọ pada pẹlu awọn alaye.
Up and down is another story, however.	Si oke ati isalẹ jẹ itan miiran, sibẹsibẹ.
I do not need love.	Nko nilo ife.
Most of them have not changed.	Pupọ ninu wọn ko yipada.
However they continue to exist.	Sibẹsibẹ wọn tẹsiwaju lati wa.
I hope you get back soon and make more pictures.	Mo nireti pe o gba pada laipẹ ati ṣe aworan diẹ sii.
I waited for a minute.	Mo ti duro fun iṣẹju kan.
Allow this power to come to you.	Gba agbara yii laaye lati wa si ọdọ rẹ.
You are not your father's son.	Iwọ kii ṣe ọmọ baba rẹ.
The door opens again.	Ilẹkun ṣi lẹẹkansi.
There are many, many other problems with this idea.	Ọpọlọpọ, ọpọlọpọ awọn iṣoro miiran wa pẹlu ero naa.
I want it simple, about it.	Mo fẹ o rọrun, nipa rẹ.
It did not change at first.	Ko yipada ni akọkọ.
They are in another place.	Wọn wa ni aaye miiran.
I have never been one to do that.	Emi ko tii jẹ ọkan lati ṣe iyẹn.
I do not know such a thing.	Emi ko mọ iru nkan bẹẹ.
It sounds beautiful.	O ni ohun lẹwa.
He does not remember me.	Ko ranti mi.
Children stand on the road.	Awọn ọmọde duro ni opopona.
Very few trees.	Awọn igi pupọ diẹ.
I love you more than life.	Mo nifẹ rẹ ju igbesi aye lọ.
Try them for a while.	Gbiyanju wọn fun igba diẹ.
I really don't like that test.	Emi ko fẹran idanwo yẹn gaan.
But they can not forget it.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko le gbagbe rẹ.
This is not noticeable.	Eyi ko ṣe akiyesi.
He’s taking one for the team.	O n mu ọkan fun ẹgbẹ naa.
Now they are vulnerable and afraid.	Bayi wọn jẹ ipalara ati bẹru.
When you have things.	Nigbati o ba ni ohun.
I think you will really enjoy it.	Mo ro pe iwọ yoo gbadun rẹ gaan.
It will probably write a lot but it is still there.	O ṣee ṣe yoo kọ pupọ ṣugbọn o tun wa.
By this time, he had walked enough home.	Ni aaye yii, o ti rin to ni ile.
This situation was, however, poor.	Yi ipo je, sibẹsibẹ, ko dara.
Not at all.	Ko ṣe bẹ rara.
I went out into the cool hot water.	Mo jade lọ sinu omi gbona to dara.
They are also vulnerable.	Wọn tun ni ipalara.
I stopped it.	Mo duro ti o.
If it works, fine.	Ti o ba ṣiṣẹ, o dara.
I will not do that again.	Emi kii yoo ṣe iyẹn mọ.
I do not know how you see me.	Nko mo bi o se ri mi.
In all areas of life.	Ni gbogbo awọn agbegbe ti aye.
Do not remove the top three.	Ma ṣe yọ oke mẹta kuro.
Attach pictures if possible.	So awọn aworan ti o ba ṣee ṣe.
I missed the game.	Mo padanu ere naa.
You need a new approach.	O nilo ọna tuntun.
His men.	Awọn ọkunrin rẹ.
But not much.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ.
A small fee to pay.	A kekere owo lati san.
You have nothing to say about it.	O ko ni nkankan lati sọ nipa ti o.
Stop and look with me.	Duro ki o wo pẹlu mi.
Have you finished work yet?	Njẹ o ti pari iṣẹ sibẹsibẹ?
About the money.	Nipa owo naa.
He did everything possible, and none of it was enough.	O ṣe ohun gbogbo ti o ṣeeṣe, ati pe ko si ọkan ninu rẹ ti to.
Not as such.	Ko bi iru.
But we need to go back and think honestly.	Ṣugbọn a nilo lati pada sẹhin ki a ronu ni otitọ.
And we will talk.	Ati pe a yoo sọrọ.
I love fireworks.	Mo nifẹ awọn iṣẹ ina.
I can not wait to read much more from you.	Emi ko le duro lati ka pupọ diẹ sii lati ọdọ rẹ.
I always wear a suit.	Mo nigbagbogbo wọ aṣọ kan.
But that is not the case.	Ṣugbọn ohun naa ko wa.
You get your sleep.	O gba oorun rẹ.
I put the box on my bed and opened it.	Mo gbe apoti naa si ori ibusun mi mo si ṣi i.
But it has changed.	Ṣugbọn o ti yipada.
For this reason they can be very helpful.	Fun idi eyi wọn le ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
In other words, not very good.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, ko dara pupọ.
Your whole life depends on it.	Gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ da lori rẹ.
All in attendance were asked to leave.	Gbogbo awọn eniyan ti o wa ni a beere lati lọ kuro.
Both men stood in amazement.	Awọn ọkunrin mejeeji duro ni iyalẹnu.
This is not very good, but it is very good.	Eyi ko dara pupọ, ṣugbọn o dara julọ.
We do not yet know what is impossible.	A de ko sibẹsibẹ mọ ohun ti ko ṣee ṣe.
You know enough not to tell them that.	O mọ to ko lati sọ fun wọn pe.
He is in the night houses.	O wa ni awọn ile alẹ.
We must reconsider the project now.	A gbọdọ tun ronu iṣẹ naa bayi.
Your eyes are tired.	Oju re ti re.
You read the whole bill.	O ka gbogbo owo naa.
However there is still a way to go.	Sibẹsibẹ ọna kan tun wa lati lọ.
I will say something to him.	Emi yoo sọ nkankan fun u.
Nice to see you.	O dara lati ri ọ.
I go ahead tomorrow.	Mo lọ si iwaju ọla.
Lets call the game.	Jẹ ki o pe ere naa.
Someone is calling my name.	Ẹnikan n pe orukọ mi.
And you can know how it works.	Ati pe o le mọ bi o ṣe n ṣe.
The most out-of-town area.	Agbegbe ti o jade julọ ti ilu.
He and the other man went out again.	Oun ati ọkunrin to ku naa tun jade.
I thought about it for a long time.	Mo ro nipa rẹ fun igba pipẹ.
As it turns out, both sides can have a point.	Bi o ti wa ni jade, awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji le ni aaye kan.
In a chair.	Ninu ijoko kan.
He always gives.	O n fun ni nigbagbogbo.
See how long it lasted.	Wo bi o ṣe pẹ to.
You can not believe.	O ko le gbagbọ.
All students need a table.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọ ile-iwe nilo ni tabili kan.
You can download and take a look at how it works.	O le gba ati ki o ya a wo lori bi o ti ṣiṣẹ.
And how and all.	Ati bi o ati gbogbo.
The first and only.	Ni igba akọkọ ti ati ki o nikan.
There is only one of you.	Ọkan nikan ni o wa ninu yin.
This will not be good.	Kii yoo dara.
We do not miss them.	A ko padanu wọn.
Game over, small car.	Ere pari, ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kekere.
And he lost it.	O si padanu rẹ.
This is not true anymore.	Eyi kii ṣe otitọ mọ.
So just in time.	Nitorina o kan ni akoko.
He’s learning.	O n kọ.
He kept eating his money alone.	O pa lati jẹun owo rẹ nikan.
This is why we know people.	Eyi ni idi ti a fi mọ awọn eniyan.
It feels good.	O ro dara.
We all love stories.	Gbogbo wa nifẹ awọn itan.
I can't have a gift for a man.	Emi ko le ni ẹbun fun ọkunrin kan.
Another very interesting value.	Miiran gidigidi awon iye.
Something special.	Nkan pataki.
I found him a really hot guy.	Mo ti ri i a gan gbona eniyan.
Not my best work, or very soon.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ mi ti o dara julọ, tabi laipẹ pupọ.
That is possible of course.	Iyẹn ṣee ṣe dajudaju.
But some members are doing more to help than others.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ n ṣe diẹ sii lati ṣe iranlọwọ ju awọn miiran lọ.
And away from buildings.	Ati kuro lati awọn ile.
Remember that your main problem is your family.	Ranti pe iṣoro akọkọ rẹ jẹ idile rẹ.
Look, why not just.	Wo, kilode ti o ko kan.
We treat the body to the nature of our body.	A tọju nipa ti ara si iru ti ara wa.
Others will be difficult to kill.	Awọn miiran yoo nira lati pa.
He has not shaved for many weeks.	Ko tii irun fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọsẹ.
I don’t even know where I started with that.	Emi ko paapaa mọ ibiti mo ti bẹrẹ pẹlu iyẹn.
You can read them.	O le ka wọn.
I have more time, more space, more desire to give.	Mo ni akoko diẹ sii, aaye diẹ sii, ifẹ diẹ sii lati fun.
It does nothing for you.	Ko ṣe nkankan fun ọ.
We already do.	A ṣe tẹlẹ.
They were all arrested.	Gbogbo wọn ni wọn mu.
I find myself doing that a lot.	Mo ri ara mi n ṣe iyẹn pupọ.
Nice to get together, girl.	O dara julọ lati gba papọ, ọmọbirin.
Some money is better than no money.	Diẹ ninu awọn owo ni o dara ju ko si owo.
It is not a beautiful picture.	Kii ṣe aworan lẹwa.
He came to live in the city.	O wa lati gbe ni ilu.
I am in a hurry.	Mo yara yara.
They have no intention of doing anything.	Wọn ko ni ero lati ṣe ohunkohun.
Not on this.	Ko lori eyi.
We have talked about this.	A ti sọrọ nipa eyi.
I have never seen any money.	Nko ri owo kankan ri.
I am still trying to get through two things.	Mo tun n gbiyanju lati gba nipasẹ awọn nkan meji.
Wash and iron clothes.	Wẹ ati irin aṣọ.
It was two people.	O jẹ eniyan meji.
I will teach you.	Emi yoo kọ ọ.
I am planning for my life.	Mo n gbero fun igbesi aye mi.
And that too is surprising.	Ati pe iyẹn paapaa jẹ iyalẹnu.
Just look at what you want to say.	O kan wo ohun ti o fẹ sọ.
The same one speaks for both.	Awọn kanna ọkan sọ fun awọn mejeeji.
We have a lot of stuff in place right now.	A ni pupọ julọ awọn nkan ni aaye ni bayi.
Maybe for most of them.	Boya fun ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn.
There is no easy way.	Ko si ọna ti o rọrun.
I finished.	Mo ti pari.
That is not their first job.	Iyẹn kii ṣe iṣẹ akọkọ wọn.
I let her go and started dressing.	Mo jẹ ki o lọ ki o si bẹrẹ si wọ aṣọ.
You get that story and it makes it work for you.	O gba itan yẹn ati pe o jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ fun ọ.
And that says something.	Ati pe iyẹn n sọ nkan kan.
He does not want to be there anymore.	Ko fẹ lati wa nibẹ mọ.
I do not agree to be.	Emi ko gba lati wa ni.
I need it, he thought.	Mo nilo rẹ, o ronu si.
He told me he did.	O sọ fun mi pe o ṣe.
This guy is a little kid who was in a position at one point.	Ọkunrin yii jẹ ọmọ kekere ti o wa ni ipo ni akoko kan.
You can also fast.	O tun le yara yara ju.
It will not kill me.	Ko ni pa mi.
So they have to come from a local system.	Nitorina wọn gbọdọ wa lati eto agbegbe kan.
Nice to laugh after the day we had.	O dara lati rẹrin lẹhin ọjọ ti a ni.
Than any other time of day.	Ju eyikeyi miiran igba ti ọjọ.
You can't ignore it.	O ko le ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
Such a story is so.	Iru itan rẹ jẹ bẹ.
That is what we need.	Ohun ti a nilo niyẹn.
Two eyes are better than one.	Oju meji dara ju ọkan lọ.
Your word is your agreement.	Ọrọ rẹ jẹ adehun rẹ.
Nothing will change.	Ko si ohun ti yoo yi.
Today, not tomorrow.	Loni, kii ṣe ọla.
Your body will follow you.	Ara rẹ yoo tọ ọ.
I am not the best.	Emi ko dara ju.
Children must learn to walk before they can run.	Awọn ọmọde gbọdọ kọ ẹkọ lati rin ṣaaju ki wọn to le sare.
They take a long time to build.	Wọn gba akoko pipẹ lati kọ.
I am happy for them.	Inu mi dun fun won.
You have three days to live.	O ni ọjọ mẹta lati gbe.
I must keep a clear head.	Mo gbọdọ pa a ko o ori.
She's a woman, again.	O jẹ obinrin, lẹẹkansi.
In the end, the decision must come from one person.	Ni ipari, ipinnu gbọdọ wa lati ọkan eniyan.
Can't explain how angry he was with me.	Ko le ṣe alaye bi o ṣe binu fun mi.
I know you have never seen me before.	Mo mọ pe o ko ti ri mi tẹlẹ.
I will not have.	Emi kii yoo ni.
This is easy.	Eyi rọrun.
That is not my place.	Iyẹn kii ṣe aaye mi.
It is love at first sight.	O jẹ ifẹ ni oju akọkọ.
There is so much information.	Alaye pupọ wa.
Most homes have small gardens.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile ni awọn ọgba kekere.
You know how much you mean to me.	O mọ iye ti o tumọ si mi.
Sometimes that works.	Nigba miiran iyẹn ṣiṣẹ.
Let him be surprised.	Jẹ ki o ṣe iyalẹnu.
Can be used on face and body.	Le ṣee lo lori oju ati ara.
That he would talk to her that way.	Pe oun yoo ba a sọrọ ni ọna yẹn.
It is your time now.	O jẹ akoko tirẹ ni bayi.
This is very wrong for him.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe pupọ fun u.
It will again when you return.	O yoo lẹẹkansi nigbati o ba pada.
This obviously will not be a work day.	Eyi han gbangba kii yoo jẹ ọjọ iṣẹ kan.
Let him love you before you see what you really get.	Jẹ ki o nifẹ ṣaaju ki o to rii ohun ti o gba gaan.
The name depends on the area in which you live.	Orukọ naa da lori agbegbe ti o ngbe.
You have to be strong.	O ni lati jẹ agbara.
I have found nothing other than personal materials.	Mo ti ri ohunkohun miiran ju awọn ohun elo ti ara ẹni.
Which I do not.	Eyi ti Emi ko.
It is up to them.	Ọwọ wọn ni.
The word "wonderful" means 'wonderful' or 'amazing'.	Ọrọ naa "iyanu" tumọ si 'iyanu' tabi 'iyalẹnu'.
But my new space is up.	Ṣugbọn aaye tuntun mi ti wa ni oke.
Just come with the area.	O kan wa pẹlu agbegbe naa.
Most should not.	Pupọ julọ ko yẹ.
He showed me a picture.	O fi aworan han mi.
He was not afraid.	O ko bẹru.
But we need to give them help.	Ṣugbọn a nilo lati fun wọn ni iranlọwọ.
There is no table.	Ko ni tabili.
We have such a great talk.	A ni iru kan nla Ọrọ.
Your body looks great here.	Ara rẹ dara julọ nibi.
He did not get up.	Ko gba soke.
He hurried to work.	O yara lọ si ibi iṣẹ.
This is interesting, you see.	Eleyi jẹ awon, o ri.
Maybe burn it.	Boya sun rẹ ni.
Dad did the same.	Baba ṣe kanna.
In some ways, this is nothing new.	Ni diẹ ninu awọn ọna, eyi kii ṣe nkan tuntun.
You want to give me, great.	O fẹ lati fun mi, nla.
I think this is where it should be.	Mo ro pe eyi ni ibi ti o yẹ ki o wa.
We will leave early.	A yoo lọ kuro ni kutukutu.
Do things that make you happy.	Ṣe awọn ohun ti o mu inu rẹ dun.
It is about me.	O jẹ nipa mi.
They have no value to anything.	Wọn ko ni iye si nkankan.
There is a plan.	Eto kan wa.
And we do not know why.	Ati pe a ko mọ idi.
And that happened.	Ati pe iyẹn ṣẹlẹ.
My mouth dropped open.	Ẹnu mi silẹ silẹ.
We spent a week on this project.	A lo ọsẹ kan lori iṣẹ yii.
You would think that art is everyone's business.	Iwọ yoo ro pe aworan jẹ iṣẹ ti gbogbo eniyan.
Remember when you said that?	Ranti nigbati o sọ bẹ?
He kept his love on the table.	O si pa ife rẹ lori tabili.
And this game has the ability to have that kind of story in it.	Ati pe ere yii ni agbara lati ni iru itan ninu rẹ.
You will, again, be wrong.	Iwọ yoo, lẹẹkansi, jẹ aṣiṣe.
All is well.	Gbogbo rẹ dara.
You have to pick it up.	O gbọdọ gbe soke.
I have no brother.	Emi ko ni arakunrin.
So as soon as they did.	Nitorina ni kete ti wọn ti ṣe.
I want to talk a little bit about why we are here today.	Mo fẹ lati sọrọ kekere kan nipa idi ti a wa nibi loni.
Can we buy new shoes?	Njẹ a le ra bata tuntun?
Obviously this is something that lasts longer.	O han ni eyi jẹ nkan ti o gun ju igba pipẹ.
And it was the wrong thing to do.	Ati pe o jẹ ohun ti ko tọ lati ṣe.
These cats are not morning cats.	Awọn ologbo wọnyi kii ṣe ologbo owurọ.
He promised not to tell the children.	O ṣe ileri pe ko sọ fun awọn ọmọde.
Of course you can.	Dajudaju o le.
It is also used in hot weather for weddings.	O tun lo ni oju ojo gbona fun awọn igbeyawo.
Not good for kids at all.	Ko dara fun awọn ọmọde patapata.
I do not believe this is enough.	Emi ko gbagbọ pe eyi to.
It is made to work and run.	O ti ṣe lati ṣiṣẹ ati ṣiṣe.
One by one the children entered the room.	Ọkan nipa ọkan awọn ọmọ wọ yara.
He will not be able to open the box.	Oun kii yoo ni anfani lati ṣii apoti naa.
They can touch them, open them, look through.	Wọn le fi ọwọ kan wọn, ṣii, wo nipasẹ.
This is a school for young children.	Eyi jẹ ile-iwe fun awọn ọmọde kekere.
He really missed it.	O padanu rẹ gaan.
From here.	Lati aaye.
It was a bad one.	O je kan buburu.
Good to go.	O dara lati lọ.
I’ve seen too much, really.	Mo ti ri pupọ ju, ni otitọ.
We may not know if it worked for another 30 years.	A le ma mọ boya o ṣiṣẹ fun ọgbọn ọdun miiran.
This did not happen today.	Eyi ko ṣẹlẹ loni.
But that’s because it doesn’t have any.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ nitori ko ni eyikeyi.
I have not killed anything already.	Emi ko tii pa ohunkohun tẹlẹ.
We will give them back to him.	A yoo fi wọn pada fun u.
Don't expect too much.	Maṣe reti pupọ.
I hope you keep it to yourself.	Mo nireti pe ki o pa ararẹ mọ.
This does not take long.	Eyi ko gba akoko pipẹ.
And, like our home, there are no friends.	Ati, bi ile wa, ko si awọn ọrẹ.
You are the only one.	Iwọ nikan ni.
Which they always do.	Eyi ti wọn ṣe nigbagbogbo.
I do not have enough time.	Emi ko ni akoko to.
He picked it up, looked at it.	O gbe e soke, o wo o.
That would do well.	Iyẹn yoo ṣe daradara.
He removed his key from the fire.	O si yọ bọtini rẹ kuro lati ina.
Tell him to do it.	Sọ fun u lati ṣe.
I can see it now, however.	Mo le rii ni bayi, sibẹsibẹ.
Police have blocked roads leading to the city.	Ọlọpa ti di awọn ọna ti o lọ si ilu naa.
I'm telling the truth.	Mo sọ otitọ.
They did not notice each other.	Wọn ko ṣe akiyesi ara wọn.
The city does not have enough buses.	Ilu ko ni awọn ọkọ akero to.
You have nothing to fear.	O ko ni nkankan lati bẹru.
And drinking is available.	Ati mimu wa.
I look back.	Mo wo ẹhin.
We need to do something.	A nilo lati se nkankan.
And it is an even better idea for men.	Ati pe o jẹ imọran paapaa dara julọ fun awọn ọkunrin.
I do not know what is right.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o tọ.
That's what you have to do.	Ohun ti o ni lati ṣe niyẹn.
They all do not want to return the money.	Gbogbo wọn ko fẹ lati da owo naa pada.
At least here below.	O kere ju nibi ni isalẹ.
He fell asleep this morning.	O sun ni owurọ yi.
Let yourself see them.	Jẹ ki ara rẹ ri wọn.
This will be interesting.	Eleyi yoo jẹ awon.
The doctors asked him many questions.	Awọn dokita beere lọwọ rẹ ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere.
It was one of those games that hit you.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ere ti wọn ti lu ọ.
I ran to her.	Mo sare lọ si ọdọ rẹ.
I know it's a lot to ask ,.	Mo mọ pe o jẹ pupọ lati beere,.
This car is easy to drive.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yii rọrun lati wakọ.
Just say so.	O kan sọ bẹ.
They tried, however.	Wọn gbiyanju, sibẹsibẹ.
He was so great to work with.	O si jẹ ki nla lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu awọn.
It gives them a reason, something to live for.	O fun wọn ni idi kan, nkankan lati gbe fun.
This will give us a picture of the value we found.	Eyi yoo fun wa ni aworan ti iye ti a rii.
Always sit in the correct position.	Nigbagbogbo joko ni ipo ti o tọ.
Very good to your children.	O dara pupọ si awọn ọmọ rẹ.
Just hope it happens.	O kan nireti pe yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Not so.	Kii ṣe bẹ.
When bad things happen to other people.	Nigbati awọn ohun buburu ba ṣẹlẹ si awọn eniyan miiran.
They are not much.	Wọn kii ṣe pupọ.
There were more now.	Nibẹ wà diẹ sii bayi.
He was with her.	O si wà pẹlu rẹ.
You can play any one you want.	O le mu eyikeyi ọkan ti o fẹ.
But he did not stop.	Sugbon ko duro.
Her friends laughed.	Awọn ọrẹ rẹ rẹrin.
Have you heard this.	Njẹ o ti gbọ eyi.
And the problem is with us.	Ati pe iṣoro naa wa pẹlu wa.
But if you tell anyone, you know what will happen.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba sọ fun ẹnikẹni, o mọ ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Work, school sun.	Iṣẹ, oorun ile-iwe.
He had, in fact, never seen it.	O ti ni, ni otitọ, ko ri i.
That will take months.	Iyẹn yoo gba awọn oṣu.
There is so much that we do not understand.	O wa pupọ ti a ko loye.
I do not know what else to say.	Emi ko mọ kini ohun miiran lati sọ.
He took it and set the book on fire.	O mu ati pe o fi ina si iwe naa.
Things happen.	Awọn nkan ti o ṣẹlẹ.
You will continue to work in the store, of course.	Iwọ yoo tẹsiwaju lati ṣiṣẹ ni ile itaja, dajudaju.
You know, and not much of them.	O mọ, ko si ṣe pupọ ninu wọn.
You need to understand this.	O nilo lati ni oye eyi.
It's coming here.	O n bọ nibi.
The celebration is open to the public.	Ayẹyẹ naa ṣii si gbogbo eniyan.
It has become life.	O ti di igbesi aye.
You don’t want to die out here.	O ko fẹ lati ku jade nibi.
You always do.	O nigbagbogbo ṣe.
Only to hope.	Nikan lati nireti.
I am not feeling well.	Ara mi ko dara.
It always stays the same.	O nigbagbogbo duro kanna.
Stop here and talk to me.	Duro nibi ki o si ba mi sọrọ.
Your best is to be good enough.	Ti o dara ju rẹ ni lati dara to.
He always walks his dog.	Nigbagbogbo o rin aja rẹ.
They come to work.	Wọn wa lati ṣiṣẹ.
This route is a great trip.	Ọna yii jẹ irin-ajo to dara julọ.
He felt old, too.	O si ro atijọ, ju.
There are a few weddings this year.	Awọn igbeyawo diẹ wa ni ọdun yii.
It can't be left as it is because it won't work.	Ko le fi silẹ bi o ṣe jẹ nitori pe kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
But we do not think so.	Sugbon a ko ro bẹ.
We can really do it with more food.	A le ṣe gaan pẹlu ounjẹ diẹ sii.
And yet, for me, it has always been my favorite.	Ati sibẹsibẹ, fun mi, o jẹ ayanfẹ mi nigbagbogbo.
Or you will hurt me.	Tabi iwọ yoo ba mi jẹ.
This too is incorrect.	Eyi paapaa ko tọ.
City to do so.	Ilu lati ṣe bẹ.
You need to find out more of those moments.	O nilo lati wa diẹ sii ti awọn akoko yẹn.
This is good.	Eyi dara.
Nothing tastes good.	Nkankan ko dun daradara.
So he did.	Nitorina o ṣe.
I see it changes a little.	Mo rii pe o yipada diẹ.
Do not break it.	Maṣe fọ o.
We have to do it for ourselves.	A ni lati ṣe fun ara wa.
We must make sure that such a thing does not happen again.	A gbọdọ rii daju pe iru nkan bẹẹ ko ṣẹlẹ mọ.
You can play now, and your heart knows that.	O le mu ni bayi, ati pe ọkan rẹ mọ iyẹn.
Places like the real thing are excluded.	Ibi bi ohun ti o wa gan ti wa ni rara.
The family is almost out.	Ebi naa ti fẹrẹ le jade.
Now we miss them.	Bayi a padanu wọn.
Maybe it was my problem.	Boya o jẹ iṣoro mi.
It just hit me how.	O kan lu mi bawo ni.
I'll have your drink in a minute.	Emi yoo wọ ohun mimu rẹ ni iṣẹju kan.
For now, it has nothing to do with anything.	Fun bayi, ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu ohunkohun.
It allows you to spend time with the truth.	O jẹ ki o fun akoko kan pẹlu otitọ.
And we come from outside the city, most of us.	Ati pe a wa lati ita ilu, pupọ julọ wa.
I don't need that this morning.	Emi ko nilo iyẹn ni owurọ yii.
I don’t mean to be difficult.	Emi ko tumọ si lati nira.
That's the only reason.	Iyẹn nikan ni idi.
But we do not want to use them forever.	Ṣugbọn a ko fẹ ki a lo wọn lailai.
My opinion, no.	Ero mi, ko si.
And, last, remember this.	Ati, kẹhin, ranti eyi.
People see what they hope to see.	Awọn eniyan wo ohun ti wọn nireti lati rii.
It is one thing.	Ohun kan ni.
I am still trying to find the perfect one.	Mo tun n gbiyanju lati wa eyi ti o pe.
This includes, in my opinion, education.	Eyi pẹlu, ninu ero mi, ẹkọ.
It's easy to do.	O rọrun lati ṣe.
None of her friends saw her again.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ọrẹ rẹ ti o ri i lẹẹkansi.
The member knows where he is from.	Ọmọ ẹgbẹ naa mọ ibiti o ti wa.
So you have to get up.	Nitorina o ni lati dide.
We have no time to lose.	A ko ni akoko lati padanu.
There was so much he wanted to ask.	Nibẹ wà ki Elo ti o fe lati beere.
I believe it did for me.	Mo gbagbọ pe o ṣe fun mi.
Maybe he'll talk to her.	Boya oun yoo ba a sọrọ.
Lack of.	Ko ni.
They have a few minutes, maybe.	Wọn ni iṣẹju diẹ, boya.
You need advice on what to do.	O nilo imọran nipa kini lati ṣe.
He hopes his understanding.	O nireti pe oye rẹ.
I have to accept.	Mo gbọdọ gba.
He did not give me anything.	O ko fun mi ni ohunkohun.
Do not get in the way.	Maṣe gba ọna.
We will do it again this week.	A yoo tun ṣe ni ọsẹ yii.
My brother sent it to me two months ago.	Arakunrin mi ti fi ranṣẹ si mi ni oṣu meji sẹhin.
I have seen for myself.	Mo ti ri fun ara mi.
I hate it.	Mo korira rẹ.
In fact, it is the other way around.	Ni otitọ, o jẹ ọna miiran ni ayika.
You just can't say anything, you know?	O kan ko le sọ ohunkohun, o mọ?
And keep myself out of the world.	Ki o si pa ara mi mọ si ita aye.
It looks good.	O wo daradara.
I have made a decision, the boy said.	Mo ti ṣe ipinnu kan, ọmọkunrin naa sọ.
Years and years and years.	Awọn ọdun ati ọdun ati ọdun wọn.

He always does.	O ṣe nigbagbogbo.
Get with your sites here.	Gba pẹlu awọn aaye rẹ nibi.
Just feel better.	O kan lero dara.

Of course there are questions.	Dajudaju awọn ibeere wa.
It opened inside.	O ṣii si inu.
They do not drink so much.	Won ko ba ko mu ki Elo.

Both women have gone too far together.	Awọn obinrin mejeeji ti kọja pupọ papọ.
I would leave the room until the fire was extinguished.	Emi yoo jade kuro ni yara titi ti ina yoo fi gba.
If it is anything, it adds energy.	Ti o ba jẹ ohunkohun, o fi agbara kun.

That is, the true time.	Eyi ni, akoko otitọ.
We have ways.	A ni awọn ọna.
They are very good about such a thing.	Wọn dara pupọ nipa iru nkan bẹẹ.

My opinion has not changed.	Ero mi ko yipada.

This is a serious problem.	Eyi jẹ iṣoro pataki kan.
He will not be strong.	Oun ko ni ni agbara.
You know where my head is.	O mọ ibi ti ori mi wa.
Very nice.	Pupọ dara julọ.
Or maybe you just want a friend.	Tabi boya o kan fẹ ọrẹ kan.
It is completely understandable.	O jẹ oye patapata.
You can teach a dog to pick a tree.	O le kọ aja lati mu igi kan.
Good to talk to.	O dara lati ba a sọrọ.
And that’s with your own company.	Ati pe iyẹn pẹlu ile-iṣẹ tirẹ.
Other places do the same.	Awọn aaye miiran tun ṣe bẹ.
The only place a person can be.	Ibi ti eniyan le wa nikan.
Very little is known to come.	Pupọ diẹ ni a mọ lati wa.
Neither his father nor his brothers.	Bẹni baba rẹ tabi awọn arakunrin rẹ.
I would consider it.	Emi yoo ro o.
I'm sorry for that.	Ma binu fun iyẹn.
He wouldn’t get that every week.	Oun kii yoo gba iyẹn ni gbogbo ọsẹ.
It should not surprise anyone who knew me then.	Ko yẹ ki o ya ẹnikẹni ti o mọ mi nigba naa.
Enjoy your trip, we love it !!.	Gbadun irin-ajo rẹ, a nifẹ rẹ!!.
I want us to be friends.	Mo fẹ ki a jẹ ọrẹ.
So go for it.	Nitorina lọ fun.
Now the problem is serious.	Bayi ni iṣoro lile.
He wrote a book or something.	O kọ iwe kan tabi nkankan.
Just continue this lesson and you will see what happens.	Kan tẹsiwaju ẹkọ yii ati pe iwọ yoo rii ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Not at all.	Kii ṣe eyi paapaa.
He could not do so.	Ko le ṣe bẹni.
With it, you can do as you wish.	Pẹlu rẹ, o le ṣe bi o ṣe fẹ.
I said it was good, and it was.	Mo ti so wipe o jẹ dara, ati awọn ti o wà.
We did some good, solid music.	A ṣe diẹ ninu awọn ti o dara, orin ri to.
It is well used to be on ships.	O ti lo daradara lati wa lori awọn ọkọ oju omi.
This is the dog, they say.	Eyi ni aja, wọn sọ.
You don't eat well.	O ko jẹun daradara.
We will be back to work soon.	A yoo pada wa si ibi iṣẹ laipẹ.
There has to be someone sitting on top of things.	Nibẹ ni lati wa ni ẹnikan joko lori oke ti ohun.
Try to be more relaxed.	Gbiyanju lati wa ni isinmi diẹ sii.
You want to get back to your own life.	O fẹ lati pada si igbesi aye ara rẹ.
Let me show you a fact here.	Jẹ ki n fi otitọ kan han ọ nibi.
Maybe not forever.	Boya kii ṣe lailai.
Head up.	Ori rẹ soke.
In other words, don’t even think about yourself.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, ko paapaa ronu nipa ara rẹ.
Your books are always in question.	Awọn iwe rẹ nigbagbogbo ni ibeere.
Make sure the situation is good.	Rii daju pe ipo naa dara.
He came and went.	O wa o si lọ.
He wanted to get back up there.	O fe lati pada soke nibẹ.
No, we stand together.	Rara, a duro papọ.
Nothing bad happened there.	Ko si ohun buburu ti o ṣẹlẹ nibẹ.
Water is a very important factor.	Omi jẹ pataki pataki.
It's not really what it's about.	O ni ko gan ohun ti o ni nipa.
Companies expect many benefits.	Awọn ile-iṣẹ nireti ọpọlọpọ awọn anfani.
We also have special conditions.	A tun ni awọn ipo pataki.
Things will be better, he said.	Awọn nkan yoo dara, o sọ.
He broke the game, and won for a while.	O fọ ere naa, o si gba fun igba diẹ.
They hope you will come to get them.	Wọn nireti pe iwọ yoo wa lati gba wọn.
Others need to go to the test.	Awọn miiran nilo lati lọ si idanwo.
They can change, they can grow.	Wọn le yipada, wọn le dagba.
He seemed to come from everywhere.	O dabi enipe o wa lati ibi gbogbo.
He touches the kitten.	O fi ọwọ kan ọmọ ologbo naa.
Now, let’s do this properly.	Bayi, jẹ ki a ṣe eyi daradara.
It is not always necessary to have money.	Ko ṣe pataki nigbagbogbo lati ni owo.
People love it.	Eniyan feran o.
He came to another box, asked one, what were you doing.	O wa si apoti miiran, o beere ọkan, kini o n ṣe.
You can't hear them now.	O ko le gbọ wọn bayi.
If so, what is the way to do this?	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, kini ọna lati ṣe eyi.
I know them completely and what they are going for.	Mo mọ wọn patapata ati ohun ti wọn n lọ.
They will not buy anything.	Wọn ko ni ra ohunkohun.
That was his first thought.	Iyẹn ni ero akọkọ rẹ.
I was, of course, too young to be there.	Mo ti wà, dajudaju, kere ju lati wa nibẹ.
He thought the water was hot.	O ro pe omi gbona.
This road is bad.	Opopona yii ko dara.
This has become very important now.	Eyi ti ṣe pataki pupọ ni bayi.
This is art.	Eleyi jẹ aworan.
I will need some time to get used to it again.	Emi yoo nilo akoko diẹ lati lo si lẹẹkansi.
Plant trees grow abundantly here.	Awọn igi ofurufu dagba ni ọpọlọpọ nibi.
Their time is excellent.	Akoko wọn dara julọ.
No more, no more.	Ko si mọ, ko si mọ.
It is one of the rules.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ofin.
What, therefore, came to the girl.	Kini, nitorina, wa si ọmọbirin naa.
But you should not try to give it to me.	Ṣugbọn o ko gbọdọ gbiyanju lati fi fun mi.
Tonight the bus is here.	Ni alẹ oni ọkọ akero wa nibi.
I don't think he ever came back after that.	Emi ko ro pe o lailai pada lẹhin ti o.
I do not know what to do there.	Emi ko mọ kini lati ṣe nibẹ.
Cities in this area are known for them	Awọn ilu ni agbegbe yii ni a mọ fun wọn
I like the news.	Mo feran iroyin naa.
I want you to come.	Mo fe ki e wa.
Get up, go again.	Dide, lọ lẹẹkansi.
We need to hate such things.	A nilo lati korira iru awọn nkan bẹẹ.
That can be a drinking game, specifically.	Iyẹn le jẹ ere mimu, ni pataki.
No.	A ko.
There is so much more.	Ọpọlọpọ diẹ sii wa.
You will love it.	Iwọ yoo nifẹ rẹ.
As you know the future.	Bi o ṣe mọ ọjọ iwaju.
Working with us is easy.	Ṣiṣẹ pẹlu wa rọrun.
Tell them.	Sọ fun wọn.
When you want something done, you want it done.	Nigbati o ba fẹ ki ohun kan ṣe, o fẹ ki o ṣe.
The police are gone now.	Ọlọpa ti lọ ni bayi.
It does well and is beautiful.	O ṣe daradara ati pe o lẹwa.
You know that, now, here in your room.	O mọ pe, bayi, nibi ninu yara tirẹ.
Thus, we are asked to register only.	Bayi, a beere lati fi orukọ silẹ nikan.
My children are gone.	Awọn ọmọ mi ti lọ.
I usually only see it in the summer.	Mo maa n rii nikan ni igba ooru.
I want This.	Mo fe Eleyi.
I don't need to play again.	Emi ko nilo lati mu ṣiṣẹ lẹẹkansi.
Do it right, and there you are.	Ṣe o tọ, ati pe o wa.
Remove heat.	Yọ ooru kuro.
Such situations have already happened.	Iru awọn ipo ti ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
It almost killed you.	O fẹrẹ pa ọ.
That is the image of the one who stands.	Iyẹn ni aworan ẹniti o duro.
Making is one such thing.	Ṣiṣe jẹ ọkan iru nkan bẹẹ.
Also help you get out of there with a car.	Tun ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ lati lọ kuro nibẹ pẹlu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
The bottom of the trees.	Isalẹ awọn igi.
I think he will love you as soon as you know him.	Mo ro pe oun yoo fẹran rẹ ni kete ti o ba mọ ọ.
That is their job.	Iṣẹ́ wọn niyẹn.
It doesn’t make it easy.	Ko jẹ ki o rọrun.
I don’t know if that’s growing and continuing.	Emi ko mọ boya iyẹn n dagba ati tẹsiwaju.
But it does not work this way.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣiṣẹ ni ọna yii.
I am convinced of that.	Mo ni idaniloju iyẹn.
Not when you think about it.	Ko nigba ti o ro nipa o.
That's easy to say.	Iyẹn rọrun lati sọ.
They hate all newspapers.	Wọn korira gbogbo awọn iwe iroyin.
That is what we must do.	Ohun ti a gbọdọ ṣe niyẹn.
It is raining.	Ojo nla ni.
I have not received anything.	Emi ko tii gba ohunkohun.
This is easy.	Eyi rọrun.
This could be the best summer of their lives.	Eyi le jẹ ooru ti o dara julọ ti igbesi aye wọn.
The program is well thought out.	Eto naa ti ronu daradara.
Can be interesting.	Le jẹ awon.
His face showed.	Oju re fi han.
I have not made a move on it.	Mo ti ko ṣe kan Gbe lori rẹ.
We have talked before.	A ti sọrọ ṣaaju ki o to.
One day, they will be able to sell that ball.	Ni ọjọ kan, wọn yoo ni anfani lati ta bọọlu yẹn.
My thoughts are almost complete.	Awọn ero mi ti fẹrẹ pari.
This house is essentially a great story.	Ile yii ni pataki itan nla.
If they had left them then at least they would have stuck.	Bi wọn ba ti fi wọn silẹ lẹhin naa ni o kere si ti wọn yoo di.
This brother can write.	Arakunrin yii le kọ.
If we happen to see.	Ti a ba ṣẹlẹ lati rii.
I started to really like this woman.	Mo bẹrẹ si fẹran obinrin yii gaan.
People will believe whatever they want.	Awọn eniyan yoo gbagbọ ohunkohun ti wọn fẹ.
He invited me to lunch.	O pe mi si ounjẹ ọsan.
I want to ask you about that.	Mo fẹ lati beere lọwọ rẹ nipa iyẹn.
Traveling across the area will be difficult.	Irin-ajo kọja agbegbe naa yoo nira.
We made some great games.	A ṣe awọn ere nla kan.
I was there in the end.	Mo wa nibẹ ni ipari.
I don’t like that, either.	Emi ko fẹ iyẹn, boya.
What are you talking about.	Kini o n sọrọ nipa.
He wanted to go home.	O fe lati lọ si ile.
You must move.	O gbọdọ gbe.
I want my own room.	Mo fẹ yara ti ara mi.
Summer is a beautiful time of year.	Ooru jẹ akoko lẹwa ti ọdun.
You admit that you have made mistakes.	O gba pe o ti ṣe awọn aṣiṣe.
Just look around.	Kan wo ni ayika.
He did not lose much.	Ko padanu pupo.
And your body will be better about it.	Ati pe ara rẹ yoo dara nipa rẹ.
I do not see you.	Nko ri i.
All three so.	Gbogbo awọn mẹta bẹ.
That's the problem with the game.	Iyẹn ni iṣoro pẹlu ere naa.
Can a person be allowed to live in such a place?	Njẹ a le gba eniyan laaye lati gbe ni iru ibi bẹẹ?
That did not happen at this time.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ ni akoko yii.
I would like the box.	Mo fẹ apoti naa.
I can't stand it anymore.	Nko le duro mo.
Now you see it as little as possible.	Bayi o ri i bi diẹ bi o ti ṣee.
We pay little attention to details.	A ṣe akiyesi akiyesi kekere si awọn alaye.
He turned and went downstairs.	O yi pada ati isalẹ o lọ.
I will try a new method.	Emi yoo gbiyanju ọna tuntun kan.
He has three.	O ni mẹta.
But today we give everything.	Ṣugbọn loni a fun ohun gbogbo.
A community that loves and is trying to get away.	Agbegbe ti o nifẹ ati pe o n gbiyanju lati lọ kuro.
They did everything for him.	Wọn ṣe ohun gbogbo fun u.
That, however, is unlikely to happen.	Iyẹn, sibẹsibẹ, ko ṣeeṣe lati ṣẹlẹ.
It will always be in the news.	O yoo wa ninu awọn iroyin nigbagbogbo.
I did not go last.	Emi ko lọ kẹhin.
I will never let that happen again.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
Just to do it all over again.	Nikan lati ṣe gbogbo rẹ lẹẹkansi.
He never forgot it.	Ko gbagbe re rara.
It was his end.	O jẹ ipari rẹ.
This is me now.	Eyi ni mi ni bayi.
And there it was.	Ati nibẹ ti o wà.
As such, it is no longer a game.	Bi iru bẹẹ, kii ṣe ere mọ.
That let the first person hear.	Iyẹn jẹ ki ẹni akọkọ gbọ.
However, this did not work for me.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi ko ṣiṣẹ fun mi.
And it could be wrong.	Ati pe o le jẹ aṣiṣe.
If they just die so they can go on.	Ti wọn ba kan ku ki wọn lọ a le tẹsiwaju.
Just move to the area.	O kan gbe si agbegbe naa.
This needs to happen on both sides.	Eyi nilo lati ṣẹlẹ ni ẹgbẹ mejeeji.
We agree that it is.	A gba pe o jẹ.
They can be very good.	Wọn le dara pupọ.
And they can never get out.	Ati pe wọn ko le jade rara.
It’s very informative.	O ṣe alaye pupọ.
It's completely worth it.	O tọ patapata.
They must have more.	Wọn gbọdọ ni diẹ sii.
True love is hard to find these days.	Ifẹ otitọ jẹ gidigidi lati wa awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
You can't let that get in your head.	O ko le jẹ ki iyẹn wọ ori rẹ.
Now, open.	Bayi, ṣii.
You don’t want him to do this.	O ko fẹ ki o ṣe eyi.
Bread is always a good holiday.	Akara jẹ isinmi to dara nigbagbogbo.
We write songs every day.	A kọ awọn orin ni gbogbo ọjọ.
That's not a bad thing, in my opinion.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun buburu, ni ero mi.
I like it very much.	Mo feran re pupo.
But they have to.	Ṣugbọn wọn ni lati.
Even this is not enough.	Paapaa eyi ko to.
These are the two boys.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn ọmọkunrin meji.
You will encounter many difficulties along the way.	Iwọ yoo pade ọpọlọpọ awọn iṣoro ni ọna.
They do not see us.	Wọn ko ri wa.
Got to be pretty high.	Ni lati wa ni lẹwa ga.
We took the boat.	A mu ọkọ oju omi naa.
Not for children.	Kii ṣe fun awọn ọmọde.
I do not know them all.	Emi ko mọ gbogbo wọn.
Some of them may die.	Diẹ ninu wọn le ku.
There are two problems with this method.	Awọn iṣoro meji wa pẹlu ọna yii.
He did not call the police.	Ko pe ọlọpa.
Best not to tell him, any of it.	Ti o dara ju pe ko sọ fun u, eyikeyi ninu rẹ.
He has always loved to read.	O ti nigbagbogbo feran lati ka.
You don’t have to do much of that for them.	O ko ni lati ṣe pupọ ninu iyẹn fun wọn.
The man who wrote that statement is a story.	Ọkunrin ti o kọ ọrọ yẹn jẹ itan.
Days to weeks.	Awọn ọjọ si awọn ọsẹ.
They turned to look outside.	Wọn yipada lati wo ita.
Now one last thought.	Bayi ọkan kẹhin ero.
First there are people.	Ni akọkọ awọn eniyan wa.
And if they can't talk, they go out.	Ati pe ti wọn ko ba le sọrọ, wọn jade.
Do it really well.	Ṣe o dara gaan.
The sun will soon set.	Oorun yoo wọ laipẹ.
And they haven’t worked on it at all.	Ati pe wọn ko ti ṣiṣẹ lori rara.
I want to give some amazing advice.	Mo fẹ lati fun ni imọran ti iyalẹnu.
It is impossible for a person to know everything.	Ko ṣee ṣe fun eniyan kan lati mọ ohun gbogbo.
That caught their attention.	Iyẹn gba akiyesi wọn.
People say maybe someone is there.	Awọn eniyan sọ pe boya ẹnikan wa nibẹ.
There is nothing you can do to change that.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe lati yi iyẹn pada.
I do not know when.	Emi ko mọ nigbati.
But with or without me, it will happen.	Ṣugbọn pẹlu tabi laisi mi, yoo ṣẹlẹ.
It was so hard.	O je ki lile.
I'm sorry you all missed that one.	Ma binu pe gbogbo yin padanu ọkan yẹn.
Someone stood there.	Ẹnikan duro nibẹ.
At least it looks like it.	O kere ju o dabi rẹ.
She always carried her baby.	Nigbagbogbo o gbe ọmọ rẹ.
I don’t know what the story is.	Emi ko mọ kini itan naa jẹ.
But there are people out there who need help.	Ṣugbọn awọn eniyan wa nibẹ ti o nilo lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
We have planned a lot.	A ti gbero pupọ.
That is their main strength.	Iyẹn jẹ agbara pataki wọn.
In what does not exist, and now will not.	Ninu ohun ti ko ni, ati ni bayi kii yoo.
I mean, right now.	Mo tumọ si, ni bayi.
She has children in the back.	O ni awọn ọmọde ni ẹhin.
But that doesn’t work at the moment.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣiṣẹ ni akoko yii.
These books are for my sister.	Awọn iwe wọnyi wa fun arabinrin mi.
We hope to help him in his work.	A nireti lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u ni iṣẹ rẹ.
He stopped, he turned.	O duro, o yipada.
It was a special "youth" day.	O je kan pataki "odo" ọjọ.
There was really something to do at home.	Nibẹ wà gan nkankan lati se ni ile.
It pulled me in a whole new way.	O fa mi ni ọna tuntun.
The bed was made.	A ṣe ibusun naa.
None of these are important.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn wọnyi ti o ṣe pataki.
That didn’t change anything.	Iyẹn ko yi ohunkohun pada.
The men were able to lift a car.	Awọn ọkunrin naa ni agbara lati gbe ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
I'm too tired to be strong.	O ti re mi pupo lati ni agbara.
That could also be so, of course.	Iyẹn tun le jẹ bẹ, dajudaju.
He did not go to the place of his other son.	Ko lọ si ibi ti ọmọ rẹ miiran.
Or at least you said it was.	Tabi o kere ju o sọ pe o jẹ.
It has been that position for a month.	O ti di ipo yẹn fun oṣu kan.
Our time is up.	Akoko wa ti pari.
My sister, did not sleep.	Arabinrin mi, ko sun.
The company also performs all other functions.	Ile-iṣẹ naa tun ṣe gbogbo awọn iṣẹ miiran.
There is not much you can do.	Ko si pupọ ti o le ṣe.
Not the company.	Kii ṣe ile-iṣẹ naa.
One of the two trials appeared.	Ọkan ninu awọn idanwo meji ti han.
I have books.	Mo ni awọn iwe.
Things seemed to go well at first.	Ohun dabi enipe o lọ daradara ni akọkọ.
You must have a reason.	O gbọdọ ni idi kan.
The work is very important.	Iṣẹ naa ṣe pataki pupọ.
I borrowed a book for a friend.	Mo ya iwe kan fun ọrẹ kan.
And that will be enough.	Ati pe iyẹn yoo ni lati to.
It has been like this all summer.	O ti jẹ bi eyi ni gbogbo igba ooru.
He tried to kill me.	O gbiyanju lati pa mi.
He never died.	Ko ku rara.
Don't even try.	Maṣe gbiyanju paapaa.
And they are beautiful to look at.	Ati pe wọn lẹwa lati wo.
I hope it helps you, especially !.	Mo nireti pe o ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ, paapaa!.
Her dress is made from fine fabric.	Aṣọ rẹ ti a ṣe lati aṣọ ti o dara.
I give this to him.	Mo fi eyi fun u.
You just can't keep your mouth shut.	O kan ko le pa ẹnu rẹ mọ.
Do not look at the sea, you say to yourself.	Maṣe wo okun, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
He picked up my phone.	O gba foonu mi.
Please provide details.	Jọwọ ṣe alaye ni awọn alaye.
I came back for you.	Mo ti pada wa fun e.
We will probably never meet again.	A yoo jasi ko pade lẹẹkansi.
None of this matters if you believe you have the power.	Ko si eyi ti o ṣe pataki ti o ba gbagbọ pe o ni agbara.
Okay, there you are.	O dara, o wa.
In recent years, many small businesses have sprung up.	Ni awọn ọdun diẹ, ọpọlọpọ awọn ile-iṣẹ kekere ti dide.
She is the mother of three children.	O jẹ iya ti ọmọ mẹta.
I will make you happy.	Emi yoo mu inu rẹ dun.
You do not need that.	O ko nilo iyẹn.
The trees have legs.	Awọn igi ni awọn ẹsẹ.
I tried to give the baby something back, you know.	Mo gbiyanju lati fun ọmọ naa ni nkan pada, o mọ.
That was fun.	Ti o wà fun.
Note two weeks.	Akiyesi ọsẹ meji.
You can do this at home, man.	O le ṣe eyi ni ile, eniyan.
Maybe that’s how it should be.	Boya iyẹn jẹ bi o ti yẹ.
Such a thing is possible.	Iru nkan bẹẹ ṣee ṣe.
Get out of bed when you can't sleep.	Jade kuro ni ibusun nigbati o ko le sun.
I will be your ear.	Emi yoo jẹ eti rẹ.
He will leave his car for me.	Oun yoo fi ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ silẹ fun mi.
Nor was it that day.	Tabi wà ti ọjọ.
There is not much water here.	Ko si omi pupọ nibi.
Now, go do it.	Bayi, lọ ṣe.
Of course it does not seem to be a big room.	Dajudaju ko dabi pe o jẹ yara nla kan.
Okay, don't tell them.	O dara, maṣe sọ fun wọn.
It would have been nice to have a dog.	Yoo ti dara lati ni aja kan.
For a few minutes he let her sleep in his arms.	Fun iṣẹju diẹ o jẹ ki o sun ni ọwọ rẹ.
Just a few.	O kan diẹ.
But those games are smaller, a little more key.	Ṣugbọn awọn ere yẹn kere, bọtini kekere diẹ sii.
At least, you look that way.	O kere ju, o wo ni ọna yẹn.
Only I can do it.	Emi nikan ni o le ṣe.
You can only give.	O le fun nikan.
I have to hurry.	Mo ni lati yara.
It hasn't been killed, obviously.	O ti ko ti pa, o han ni.
The service has never been released.	Iṣẹ naa ko ti jade rara.
Not on a plane.	Ko lori ofurufu kan.
You can even play two games at the same time.	O le paapaa ṣe awọn ere meji ni akoko kanna.
See image below.	Wo aworan ni isalẹ.
Going in.	Ti lọ sinu.
Where do you start with them.	Nibo ni o bẹrẹ pẹlu wọn.
They are also very simple.	Wọn tun rọrun pupọ.
They are not too late to wait.	Wọn ko pẹ lati duro.
Without you, none of this would be possible.	Laisi iwọ, ko si ọkan ninu eyi ti yoo ṣee ṣe.
Nice to meet you.	O dun pupo lati pade yin.
However, there are advantages.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn anfani wa.
It's fast.	O yara.
He took a book from him.	O mu iwe kan lọwọ rẹ.
If this does not work, the school will be used.	Ti eyi ko ba ṣiṣẹ, ile-iwe yoo ṣee lo.
The boy did not know what he was saying.	Ọmọkunrin naa ko mọ ohun ti o n sọ.
I try to know what to say.	Mo gbiyanju lati mọ kini lati sọ.
We may wonder why.	A le Iyanu idi ti.
How much does it cost per month?	Elo ni o n gba fun oṣu kan?
Of course we are not in any trouble.	Dajudaju a ko wa ninu wahala kankan.
Or steal or something.	Tabi ji tabi nkankan.
Here is what he loves.	Eyi ni ohun ti o nifẹ.
I'm here to work.	Mo wa nibi fi iṣẹ.
Sit down and put the music on.	Joko ki o fi orin naa si.
Or just go out.	Tabi o kan jade.
We usually live in cities.	Nigbagbogbo a n gbe ni awọn ilu.
I would like to be able to use such a service.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ni anfani lati lo iru iṣẹ kan.
Less rain than expected this year.	Ojo ti o kere ju ti a reti lọ ni ọdun yii.
Letters sent to a store.	Awọn lẹta ti a fi ranṣẹ si ile itaja kan.
Maybe this is possible.	Boya eyi ṣee ṣe.
And you have heard about this before.	Ati pe o ti gbọ nipa eyi tẹlẹ.
Not going to help him if we don’t think about it.	Ko lilọ lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u ti a ko ba ronu rẹ nipasẹ.
That and someone was with me.	Iyẹn ati pe ẹnikan wa pẹlu mi.
He can not stand.	Ko le duro si.
And let that one stop.	Ki o si jẹ ki ọkan yẹn duro.
It is an easy tool to work with.	O jẹ ohun elo ti o rọrun lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
About thirty feet.	Nipa ọgbọn ẹsẹ.
I want them to move.	Mo fe wọn lati gbe.
The train station is a service station.	Ibudo ọkọ oju irin jẹ ibudo iṣẹ.
Use "woman" if you want to talk about a man.	Lo "obinrin" ti o ba fẹ sọrọ nipa eniyan kan.
But you have to die for something.	Sugbon o ni lati ku fun nkankan.
People should know that you will listen.	Eniyan yẹ ki o mọ pe iwọ yoo gbọ.
Tell him from us.	Sọ fun u lati ọdọ wa.
That moment is important.	Akoko naa ṣe pataki.
I would go home early and put my hand on it.	Emi yoo lọ si ile ni kutukutu ki n gbe ọwọ mi si ara rẹ.
Nothing is ever enough.	Ko si ohun ti wa ni lailai to.
It's too fast for him.	O yara ju fun u.
But we still have to do this profitably.	Ṣugbọn a tun ni lati ṣe eyi ni ere.
And we'd ask.	Ati pe a fẹ beere.
But do not worry.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe aniyan.
When you get to the car, stop there.	Nigbati o ba de ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ, duro nibẹ.
Try to find something like the one below.	Gbiyanju lati wa nkan bi isalẹ.
The sister is very nice.	Arabinrin naa dara julọ.
Do what you need to do.	Ṣe ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe.
She tries not to let her tired show.	O gbiyanju lati ma jẹ ki rẹ rẹ han.
I am not a lot of people.	Emi kii ṣe ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
That sounds good.	Ohun naa dara julọ.
You have a very clear understanding of what you are feeling.	O ni oye gaan ti ohun ti o n rilara.
The room is full.	Yara ti kun.
This is one of the few.	Eyi jẹ ọkan ninu awọn diẹ.
Maybe someone deserves it, but you like it as much as it does.	Boya ẹnikan yẹ, ṣugbọn o fẹran rẹ dara julọ bi o ti jẹ.
The days were amazing and both of them were great.	Awọn ọjọ je iyanu ati awọn mejeeji ti o wà nla.
More details on the matter.	Awọn alaye diẹ sii lori ọrọ naa.
There is no car in sight.	Ko si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ni oju.
But that never happened.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ rara.
And that means a lot to me.	Ati pe iyẹn tumọ pupọ si mi.
But he agreed.	Sugbon o gba.
He refuses to explain himself.	O kọ lati ṣe alaye ara rẹ.
That's the kind of thing he would say.	Iyẹn ni iru nkan ti oun yoo sọ.
I think this is a game.	Mo ro pe eyi jẹ ere kan.
It is impossible to see outside.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati ri ita.
You can see that.	O le rii iyẹn.
I am beautiful.	Mo lẹwa.
He is such an amazing person.	O jẹ eniyan iyanu bẹ.
None of that.	Ko si ọkan ninu iyẹn.
He will get it one day.	Oun yoo gba u ni ọjọ kan.
But he stood outside.	Ṣugbọn o duro ni ita.
People write about our news.	Awọn eniyan kọ nipa awọn iroyin wa.
Okay, it will end here and now.	O dara, yoo pari nibi ati bayi.
Maybe he will.	Boya yoo nireti.
That seems difficult.	Iyẹn dabi ẹni pe o nira.
I will not wait.	Emi yoo ko duro.
Or a.	Tabi a.
I think it is not possible.	Mo ro pe ko ṣee ṣe.
In some ways, he feels like his brother.	Ni diẹ ninu awọn ọna, o lero bi arakunrin rẹ.
Tell me the truth.	Sọ otitọ fun mi.
The importance of this statement must not be forgotten.	A ko gbọdọ gbagbe pataki ti ọrọ yii.
We have a lot to drink.	A ni mimu pupọ lati ṣe.
So he is not alone.	Nitorina kii ṣe oun nikan.
There is no such system.	Ko si iru eto kan.
It caused me to wonder when it ever was.	O fa mi lati Iyanu nigbati o lailai wà.
You want to be here.	O fẹ lati wa nibi.
I'm just scared.	Mo kan bẹru.
They certainly are not.	Wọn dajudaju kii ṣe.
They are doing the best they can.	Wọn n ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ ti wọn le.
I will just have to try my best.	Emi yoo kan ni lati gbiyanju gbogbo agbara mi.
I can feel there to this day.	Mo le lero nibẹ titi di oni.
Young people in the future.	Awọn ọdọ ni ojo iwaju.
Because there is nothing else to do.	Nitori ko si ohun miiran lati se.
I'm not sure about that.	Emi ko da mi loju nipa eyi.
He spent all his time learning.	O lo gbogbo akoko rẹ lati kọ ẹkọ.
The first woman.	Obinrin akọkọ.
To be honest, this is not the first time.	Lati sọ otitọ, eyi kii ṣe igba akọkọ.
That is very important to us.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki pupọ fun wa.
You need a man of more years.	O nilo ọkunrin kan ti ọdun diẹ sii.
I want the future.	Mo fe ojo iwaju.
Once he was gone, he was gone.	Ni kete ti o ti lọ, o ti lọ.
They will give you small books about it.	Wọn yoo fun ọ ni awọn iwe kekere nipa rẹ.
But, they may be easier for you to remember.	Ṣugbọn, wọn le rọrun fun ọ lati ranti.
It’s anything you can do with it.	O jẹ ohunkohun ti o le ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
There is nothing we can do for now.	Ko si ohun ti a le ṣe fun bayi.
The sister is fine.	Arabinrin naa dara.
Find out.	Wa jade.
Some do it.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣe o.
Mo jade.	Mo jade.
It will never be used again.	O ko ni lo lẹẹkansi.
Not even for hours.	Ko paapaa fun awọn wakati.
Any ideas would be helpful.	Eyikeyi ero yoo jẹ iranlọwọ.
He lives in their system.	O n gbe ninu eto wọn.
Now you know why.	Bayi o mọ idi.
He will always be your daughter.	Oun yoo ma jẹ ọmọbirin rẹ nigbagbogbo.
She laughed and talked at the same time.	O rẹrin ati sọrọ ni akoko kanna.
Making me another story.	Ṣiṣe mi miiran itan.
I mean he broke the ball.	Mo tumọ si pe o fọ bọọlu naa.
I have to stay.	Mo ni lati duro si.
He touched them.	O fi ọwọ kan wọn.
They can’t leave well enough alone.	Wọn ko le fi silẹ daradara to nikan.
It just is.	O kan jẹ.
That should get the job done.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o gba iṣẹ naa.
It doesn't seem to matter.	O dabi pe ko ṣe akiyesi.
He knew they knew something he hadn’t done.	O mọ pe wọn mọ nkan ti ko ṣe.
We had a hard time sleeping.	A ni akoko lile lati sun.
Make sure everyone knows what to expect.	Rii daju pe gbogbo eniyan mọ ohun ti a reti.
Either way, it’s the same truth.	Ọna boya, o jẹ otitọ kanna.
Just see it.	O kan ri e.
I did through another year.	Mo ti ṣe nipasẹ ọdun miiran.
I would expect it.	Emi yoo reti rẹ.
The police force will rise so that they can perform their duties on this.	Agbara ọlọpa yoo dide ki wọn ṣe awọn iṣẹ wọn lori eyi.
So this is what is behind it.	Nitorina eyi ni ohun ti o wa lẹhin rẹ.
It was hard to even see it.	O jẹ gidigidi lati paapaa wo i.
It is an easy word to read them.	O jẹ ọrọ ti o rọrun lati ka wọn.
Very few people have such a lifestyle.	Awọn eniyan diẹ diẹ ni iru igbesi aye bẹẹ.
At least no one could find them.	O kere ko si ọkan ti wọn ti le rii.
For some reason he could not hear them.	Fun idi kan ko le gbọ wọn.
I will break them.	Emi yoo fọ wọn.
None of them expected to see him again.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o nireti lati ri i lẹẹkansi.
However, the system encounters some problems with that.	Sibẹsibẹ, eto ba pade diẹ ninu awọn iṣoro pẹlu iyẹn.
He did not want to return to the office.	Ko fẹ lati pada si ọfiisi.
As expected no.	Bi o ti ṣe yẹ ko si.
We went home.	A lọ si ile.
Life goes on.	Igbesi aye n tẹsiwaju.
It is done.	O ti ṣe.
I am not here to kill you.	Emi ko wa nibi lati pa ọ.
And that’s a hard feeling to lose like that.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ rilara lile lati padanu bii iyẹn.
One day, he will change.	Ni ọjọ kan, oun yoo yipada.
This is a mistake.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
They are just pictures of life, your life.	Wọn jẹ awọn aworan ti igbesi aye nikan, igbesi aye rẹ.
I would also like that.	Emi yoo tun fẹ iyẹn.
The car accident caused the injury.	Ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa fa ipalara naa.
There are just too many of them.	Nibẹ ni o wa kan ju ọpọlọpọ awọn ti wọn.
Take pictures the same way with and without it.	Ya awọn aworan ni ọna kanna pẹlu ati laisi rẹ.
No parents no rules.	Ko si obi ko si ofin.
Our house is not the same without it.	Ile wa kii ṣe kanna laisi rẹ.
For whatever this is.	Fun ohunkohun ti yi je.
They can no longer allow anyone to play.	Wọn ko le gba ẹnikẹni lati mu ṣiṣẹ mọ.
They can not have one.	Wọn ko le ni ọkan.
Now you are really listening.	Bayi o ti n gbọ gaan.
Remember that.	Ranti pe.
The pass in this way.	Awọn kọja ni ọna yi.
He knows everything, but he knows nothing.	O mọ ohun gbogbo, ṣugbọn o mọ ohunkohun.
She is my best friend and she loves me very much.	O jẹ ọrẹ mi to dara julọ ati pe o nifẹ mi pupọ.
I would work in the garden for or with children.	Emi yoo ṣiṣẹ ninu ọgba fun tabi pẹlu awọn ọmọde.
At this time he could not eat.	Ni wakati yii ko le jẹun.
As you wish.	Bi o ṣe fẹ.
You are on your way here.	O wa ni ọna lori ori rẹ nibi.
Everyone looks good to me.	Gbogbo eniyan wo mi dara.
You think you will sell.	O ro pe iwọ yoo ta.
We got up early to pick up the train.	A dide ni kutukutu lati mu ọkọ oju irin naa.
I tried to sleep.	Mo gbiyanju lati sun.
We can grow with them.	A le dagba pẹlu wọn.
He knew there was another one.	O mọ pe ọkan miiran wa.
We can do many things, if we have more money.	A le ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun, ti a ba ni owo diẹ sii.
Think about life itself.	Ronu nipa igbesi aye funrararẹ.
Getting up is a word that means sitting.	Dide jẹ ọrọ kan ti o tumọ si joko.
It will not boot up.	O yoo ko bata soke.
What they are saying.	Ohun ti wọn n sọ.
They will get in sight.	Wọn yoo gba ni iye oju.
Some special people are in the chair.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan pataki wa ni ijoko.
A promise that will not be kept.	Ileri ti ko ni pa a mọ.
A work of history.	A iṣẹ ti itan.
That is why we have trials.	Ti o ni idi ti a ni awọn idanwo.
This may not be enough.	Eyi le ma to.
The road leading to the city is full.	Opopona ti o lọ si ilu naa ti kun.
And this is now.	Ati pe eyi wa bayi.
A report is not.	Iroyin kan kii ṣe.
It shook my head.	O mi ori.
He is angry.	O binu.
You do not want it to go.	O ko fẹ ki o lọ.
It was such a small situation.	O je iru kan kekere ipo.
There are no words to express my love for you.	Ko si awọn ọrọ lati fi ifẹ mi han si ọ.
I think people really haven’t thought about it yet.	Mo ro pe awon eniyan gan ti ko ro nipa ti o sibẹsibẹ.
Not everyone can do what he does.	Ko gbogbo eniyan le ṣe ohun ti o ṣe.
Okay, obviously what we have to do now.	O dara, o han gbangba ohun ti a ni lati ṣe ni bayi.
Well, you got the idea.	O dara, o gba imọran naa.
There is no reason to worry about.	Ko si idi lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
What a good time.	Ohun ti o dara akoko.
His family loves him.	Ebi re feran re.
Your message is here.	Ọrọ rẹ wa nibi.
It's cold.	O ni otutu.
It was another thing to give up.	O jẹ ohun miiran lati fi silẹ.
He turned and looked at my hand.	O yipada o wo ọwọ mi.
He’s telling me we can fix ourselves.	O n sọ fun mi pe a le tun ara wa ṣe.
All he knew was that he had to talk to him.	Gbogbo ohun ti o mọ ni pe o ni lati ba a sọrọ.
I do not want this for you.	Emi ko fẹ eyi fun ọ.
I tried to think of something else.	Mo gbiyanju lati ronu nkan miiran.
But they listened.	Ṣugbọn wọn gbọ.
Only you can decide if the item is something you can handle.	Iwọ nikan ni o le pinnu boya nkan naa jẹ nkan ti o le mu.
I waited for him to come home.	Mo duro fun u lati wa si ile.
The cat washed and rubbed my feet.	Ologbo naa wẹ o si fi ọwọ pa ẹsẹ mi.
And he put his hand on her.	O si fi ọwọ rẹ si i.
There are a lot of men out there.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkunrin wa nibẹ ni ita.
If not, buy a used car.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, ra ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti a lo.
I am very tired.	O rẹ mi pupọ.
So, get out.	Nitorina, jade.
I mean, just completely.	Mo tumọ si, o kan patapata.
That is why we are able to do that.	O jẹ idi ti a ni anfani lati ṣe iyẹn.
Now the other way around.	Bayi awọn ọna miiran.
Because I love them more than you know.	Nitori Mo nifẹ wọn ju ti o mọ lọ.
They tried to tell me, every single one of them.	Wọn gbiyanju lati sọ fun mi, gbogbo ọkan ninu wọn.
They want to keep you alive.	Wọn fẹ lati jẹ ọ laaye.
I know you want to surprise him tonight.	Mo mọ pe o fẹ lati ṣe iyanu fun u ni alẹ oni.
And the price is also good.	Ati pe owo tun dara.
We stopped to eat.	A duro lati jẹun.
However, they have low physical activity.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn ni iṣẹ ṣiṣe ti ara kekere.
You have a car that does not exist.	O ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ko si tẹlẹ.
People ask for this.	Awọn eniyan beere fun eyi.
The weather is	Oju ojo je
I do not know.	Emi ko mọ.
They all carry them.	Gbogbo wọn gbe wọn.
We need to get the team back on track.	A nilo lati gba ẹgbẹ pada si ọna ti o tọ.
Try your own test.	Gbiyanju idanwo tirẹ.
You can’t let her touch your hair.	O ko le jẹ ki o fi ọwọ rẹ si irun rẹ.
He dropped me and walked out.	O kọ mi silẹ o si jade.
And will never know.	Ki yoo si mọ.
I think you go.	Mo ro pe o lọ.
It was a good feeling.	O jẹ rilara ti o dara.
But he also took himself seriously.	Ṣugbọn o tun gba ara rẹ ni pataki.
I want you to think about yours.	Mo fẹ ki o ronu nipa tirẹ.
I'll be back in two hours.	Emi yoo pada wa lẹhin awọn wakati meji.
So for him, there is no question.	Nitorina fun u, ko si ibeere.
What life calls us to be alone is.	Ohun ti igbesi aye n pe wa lati jẹ nikan ni.
He is convincing.	O n da a loju.
I'm just to say.	Mo wa lati sọ nikan.
On the back of the dog sits a small space.	Lori ẹhin aja joko aaye kekere kan.
You have to be right.	O ni lati jẹ ti o tọ.
At this time, it is not open.	Ni akoko yii, ko ṣii.
This thing is just amazing.	Nkan yii jẹ iyalẹnu nikan.
If you stop longer, you will lose the train.	Ti o ba duro diẹ sii, iwọ yoo padanu ọkọ oju irin naa.
It is, of course, much more than that.	O jẹ, dajudaju, pupọ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
He was not afraid.	Ko bẹru.
Often, this is possible.	Nigbagbogbo, eyi ṣee ṣe.
I live nearby.	Mo n gbe nitosi.
From what he said, it seems that the journey is over.	Lati inu ohun ti o sọ, o dabi pe irin-ajo naa ti pari.
And that way.	Ati pe ọna naa.
Friends will ask you why you stopped.	Awọn ọrẹ yoo beere lọwọ rẹ idi ti o fi duro.
The children are watching.	Awọn ọmọde n wo.
That child will not eat anything.	Ọmọ yẹn kii yoo jẹ ohunkohun.
He hated such food.	O korira iru ounjẹ bẹẹ.
It was a great little job.	O je kan nla kekere ise.
Those women are mothers in my eyes.	Awọn obinrin yẹn jẹ iya ni oju mi.
This is because the metals burn.	Eyi jẹ nitori awọn irin ṣe ina.
It is important to clear your mind.	O ṣe pataki lati ko ọkan rẹ kuro.
It is a long walk and takes me a while.	O ti wa ni a gun rin ati ki o gba mi a nigba ti.
I really like it.	Mo feran re gaan.
Don't keep talking.	Maṣe tẹsiwaju sọrọ.
When we sleep we do not eat.	Nigba ti a ba sun a ko jẹun.
It may have caused the accident.	O le ti fa ijamba naa.
You are wasting your time.	O n so akoko re nu.
Your interest worries me more than anything.	Anfani rẹ ṣe aniyan mi diẹ sii ju diẹ lọ.
A few hours earlier, he had been bathed.	Awọn wakati diẹ ṣaaju, o ti wẹ.
It is possible for everyone.	O ṣee ṣe si gbogbo eniyan.
She loves to drive at night.	O nifẹ lati wakọ ni alẹ.
He raised an eyebrow at the question,	O gbe oju kan soke ni ibeere,
These foods will be removed from the table.	Awọn ounjẹ wọnyi yoo yọ kuro ni tabili.
Even by day.	Paapaa nipasẹ ọjọ.
I’m not so sure, however.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bẹ, sibẹsibẹ.
He also asked her to keep it.	O tun beere lọwọ rẹ lati pa a mọ.
He did not look up, he did not speak.	O ko wo soke, ko sọrọ.
Do nothing for anyone they can and should do it for themselves.	Maṣe ṣe ohunkohun fun ẹnikẹni ti wọn le ati pe o yẹ ki o ṣe fun ara wọn.
I feel you can give me the job.	Mo ni rilara pe o le fun mi ni iṣẹ naa.
There is always something you can do.	Nkankan nigbagbogbo wa ti o le ṣe.
It is very easy to use and very tasty.	O rọrun pupọ lati lo ati pe o dun gaan.
I left for a while.	Mo fi silẹ fun igba diẹ.
I know myself better than anyone else knows me.	Mo mọ ara mi dara ju ẹnikẹni miiran mọ mi.
It has a lot of work to do.	O ni iṣẹ pupọ lati ṣe.
I no longer live that way.	Ko n gbe ni ọna yẹn mọ.
I am happy to call you my brother.	Inu mi dun lati pe e ni arakunrin mi.
You will benefit greatly from this.	Iwọ yoo ni anfani pupọ lati eyi.
That is enough to make it happen.	Wipe eyi to lati jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
It could not be better.	Ko le dara julọ.
A lot of people have done it before.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ti ṣe ṣaaju ki o to.
The same goes for drinking.	Kanna n lọ fun mimu.
Like a big brother.	Bi arakunrin nla.
You should contact the testing center before the test date.	O yẹ ki o wa ile-iṣẹ idanwo ṣaaju ọjọ idanwo naa.
Put me in a good and appropriate position.	Fi mi si ipo mi ti o dara ati ti o yẹ.
Mu dara.	Mu dara.
The fire was extinguished in less than an hour.	Ina ti a pa ni kere ju wakati kan.
These are the problems.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn iṣoro.
But we were not able to.	Sugbon a ko ni anfani lati.
Let’s take these points along the way.	Jẹ ki a mu awọn aaye wọnyi ni ọna.
Many are aware.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ti wa ni o mọ.
We have to do this every morning !.	A ni lati ṣe eyi ni gbogbo owurọ!.
That was the only reason he died.	Iyẹn nikan ni idi ti o fi pa.
Error, it is past that time.	Aṣiṣe, o ti kọja akoko yẹn.
He came to tell me.	O wa lati sọ fun mi.
My phone is too small.	Foonu mi kere pupọ.
If they kill them, they kill them.	Ti wọn ba pa wọn, wọn pa wọn.
Come on, you can handle this.	Wa, o le mu eyi.
Jobs looked at me with the right eye.	Awọn iṣẹ wo mi pẹlu oju ti o tọ.
This was clean enough.	Eleyi je mọ to.
The phone does not stop ringing.	Foonu naa ko da ohun orin duro.
His wife took him.	Iyawo re mu u.
You have to get out.	O ni lati jade.
But it just keeps coming back, again and again.	Ṣugbọn o kan n pada wa, lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
You may be in the car after the trip.	O le wa ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ lẹhin irin-ajo.
So, this did not happen.	Nitorina, eyi ko ṣẹlẹ.
But he did not like this at all.	Ṣugbọn ko fẹran eyi rara.
It was the first letter he had ever written to her.	O jẹ lẹta akọkọ ti o ti kọ fun u.
They accept the decision of the students.	Wọn gba ipinnu awọn ọmọ ile-iwe.
I have a plan 'don't ask, don't say'.	Mo ni eto 'maṣe beere, maṣe sọ'.
They have had a lot.	Wọn ti ni ọpọlọpọ.
I want to go back to my own time.	Mo fẹ lati pada si akoko ti ara mi.
A story of some kind.	A itan ti diẹ ninu awọn iru.
He was in the car park.	O wa ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
She just raised her head to look more.	O gbe ori rẹ nikan lati wo diẹ sii.
I know you do.	Mo mọ pe o ṣe.
Something happened.	Nkankan ti ṣẹlẹ.
Just about everything is dead.	O kan nipa ohun gbogbo ti ku.
Please buy your book.	Jọwọ ra iwe rẹ.
Now you know better.	Bayi o mọ dara julọ.
Dad, as he went, said more.	Baba, bi o ti lọ, sọ diẹ.
Cost out everything first.	Iye owo jade ohun gbogbo akọkọ.
But one fact seems to be that he understands everything.	Ṣugbọn otitọ kan dabi pe o ni oye lori ohun gbogbo.
But he did not say a word.	Ṣugbọn ko sọ ọrọ kan rara.
Or anything you can think of.	Tabi ohunkohun ti o le ro nipa.
That was gone three days ago.	Iyẹn ti lọ ni ọjọ mẹta sẹhin.
I will see to myself.	Emi yoo rii si ara mi.
You must promise me!	O gbọdọ ṣe ileri fun mi!
A pair of shoes.	A bata ti bata.
Most marriages start this way.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn igbeyawo bẹrẹ ni ọna yii.
And teach it the way you want.	Ki o si kọ ọ ni ọna ti o fẹ.
You have already felt it.	O ti lero rẹ tẹlẹ.
The company is losing money.	Ile-iṣẹ n padanu owo.
You need to know everything.	O nilo lati mọ ohun gbogbo.
This works well.	Eyi n ṣiṣẹ daradara.
The picture is just that, a picture.	Aworan naa jẹ iyẹn nikan, aworan kan.
Many parents love their children and are happy that they have them.	Pupọ awọn obi nifẹ awọn ọmọ wọn ati pe inu wọn dun pe wọn ni wọn.
He has a dog.	O ni aja kan.
Do we have a story for you.	Njẹ a ni itan kan fun ọ.
He hopes he doesn’t let it go.	O nireti pe ko jẹ ki o lọ.
Of course the body will grow.	Dajudaju ara yoo dagba.
Or you will let them know.	Tabi o yoo jẹ ki wọn mọ.
That means not enough to eat.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe ko to lati jẹun.
Something tells me it's in it.	Nkankan sọ fun mi pe o wa ninu rẹ.
I don't want to be angry with you.	Nko fe binu re.
Dogs need a place to live.	Awọn aja nilo ibi kan lati gbe.
And when he had finished speaking, he sat down.	Nigbati o si ti pari ọrọ rẹ, o joko.
He knew he had to do something.	O mọ pe o yẹ lati ṣe nkan kan.
Yet often people die without it.	Sibẹsibẹ nigbagbogbo awọn eniyan ku laisi rẹ.
With rest one day a week.	Pẹlu isinmi ọjọ kan ni ọsẹ kan.
What can be done?	Kini o le ṣee ṣe?
In a way it is.	Ni ọna kan o jẹ.
It is not our concern.	Kii ṣe aniyan wa.
The man may or may not understand.	Ọkunrin naa le tabi ko ni oye.
I did not ask to have the last word.	Emi ko beere lati ni awọn ti o kẹhin ọrọ.
None of this will go well.	Ko si eyi ti yoo lọ daradara.
He will have to continue.	Oun yoo ni lati tẹsiwaju.
You must have done this before.	O gbọdọ ti ṣe eyi tẹlẹ.
I have been thinking about this place a lot lately.	Mo ti ronu nipa ibi yii pupọ laipẹ.
Too much, too, too much information.	Ọna pupọ ju, bii, ọna pupọ alaye.
We are dead to that.	A ti ku si iyẹn.
Do not drop the box.	Ma ṣe ju apoti naa silẹ.
You get them in their word.	O gba wọn ni ọrọ wọn.
Let him sit there.	Jẹ ki o joko nibẹ.
But nothing has changed much.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o yipada pupọ.
They have no reason to.	Wọn ko ni idi lati.
Take the time to write yours.	Gba akoko lati kọ tirẹ.
She is not a very beautiful woman.	Ko jẹ obinrin ti o lẹwa pupọ.
The boy is not himself today.	Ọmọkunrin naa kii ṣe funrararẹ loni.
We kept that for an hour and switched for the house.	A tọju iyẹn fun wakati kan ati yipada fun ile.
Strenuous.	Gba agbara.
I did not move to stop it.	Emi ko gbe lati da a duro.
I tried everything to stop him from leaving.	Mo gbiyanju ohun gbogbo lati da u lati lọ kuro.
But nothing of the kind was found.	Ṣugbọn ko si nkankan ti iru ti a rii.
They promise it will be easy.	Wọn ṣe ileri pe yoo rọrun.
The way we planned at any time.	Ọna ti a gbero ni eyikeyi akoko.
To know who I am now.	Lati mọ ẹni ti emi jẹ bayi.
This and applications.	Yii ati awọn ohun elo.
Will come out right.	Yoo jade tọ.
Let’s see how we deal with this first.	Jẹ ki a wo bi a ṣe ṣe pẹlu eyi ni akọkọ.
I kept hearing things.	Mo ti pa a gbọ ohun.
Take a test drive and find the right one for you !.	Ṣe awakọ idanwo kan ki o rii eyi ti o tọ fun ọ!.
I really got out of my way to come across it.	Mo gan jade ninu ọna mi lati wa kọja rẹ.
Everything is well known.	Ohun gbogbo ti mọ daradara.
And the fact is that some things are just more personal.	Ati awọn otitọ ni wipe diẹ ninu awọn ohun ni o kan diẹ ti ara ẹni.
Again, another amazing meal!	Lẹẹkansi, ounjẹ iyanu miiran!
I will always remember this, he said to himself.	Emi yoo ranti eyi nigbagbogbo, o sọ fun ararẹ.
Whatever they call them.	Ohunkohun ti wọn pe wọn.
We have no agreements.	A ko ni awọn adehun.
It is possible that some women may have a history of driving.	O ṣee ṣe pe diẹ ninu awọn obinrin le ni itan awakọ rẹ.
I have never seen anything like it.	Emi ko tii ri iru eyi ri.
Tell me how you do it.	Sọ fun mi bawo ni o ṣe n ṣe.
Most homes have a garden.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile ni ọgba kan.
I'm sorry about that.	Ma binu nipa eyi.
None of this is out to happen, however.	Ko si ọkan ninu eyi ti o jade lati ṣẹlẹ, sibẹsibẹ.
I like to run on the beach.	Mo feran lati sare lori eti okun.
Without our love we were born and to him we die.	Laisi ifẹ wa a ti bi ati si rẹ a ku.
The clock is ticking.	Aago naa dun gaan.
I have seen the test.	Mo ti rii idanwo.
I don’t know what went wrong.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti lọ ti ko tọ.
Everyone knows it's time for us to move on.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ pe o to akoko fun wa lati gbe.
There is nothing that this girl will not try.	Ko si ohun ti ọmọbirin yii ko ni gbiyanju.
It’s not what you do.	Kii ṣe ohun ti o ṣe.
I need to talk to him.	Mo nilo lati ba a sọrọ.
No, no.	Rara, ko si.
Everyone else forgot their seats.	Gbogbo eniyan miiran gbagbe awọn ijoko wọn.
They will be easier.	Wọn yoo rọrun.
I can’t let that happen again.	Emi ko le jẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
You can not leave it.	O ko le lọ kuro ninu rẹ.
Naturally, you want to do better.	Nipa ti, o fẹ lati ṣe dara julọ.
Okay, all of that is true.	O dara, gbogbo iyẹn jẹ otitọ.
The same people are coming back.	Awọn eniyan kanna n pada wa.
Just let them sit together.	O kan jẹ ki wọn joko papọ.
They sang the song for three hours.	Wọn kọ orin naa ni wakati mẹta.
Or, at least.	Tabi, o kere ju.
I do not feel well.	Ara mi ko dara.
You can have as many children as you want.	O le bi ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde bi o ṣe fẹ.
My mother told me about it.	Iya mi sọ fun mi nipa rẹ.
Summer is a time of travel here.	Ooru jẹ akoko irin-ajo nibi.
We did nothing to help our situation.	A ko ṣe ohunkohun lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun ipo wa.
It's never too late to do.	Ko pẹ ju lati ṣe.
They are not interested.	Wọn ko nifẹ.
Come back, who knows how long it will last.	Pada wa, tani o mọ bi o ṣe le pẹ to.
It is summer now.	O ti wa ni ooru bayi.
He said he wanted to show me something.	O ni oun fe fi nkan han mi.
Maybe you can help us out.	Boya o le ran wa jade.
But we like the way.	Ṣugbọn a fẹran ọna naa.
One is looking at me.	Ọkan ti n wo mi.
And for a while it'd be the only one in my life.	Ati fun igba diẹ o fẹ jẹ ọkan nikan ni igbesi aye mi.
If the thing works long enough.	Ti nkan naa ba n ṣiṣẹ ni pipẹ to.
It went really well.	O lọ gan daradara.
Most people have never seen one before.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ko tii ri ọkan tẹlẹ.
So it has to be a story.	Nitorina o ni lati jẹ itan kan.
Take a picture of it.	Ya aworan kan ti o.
He knew it was possible he might not come back.	O mọ pe o ṣee ṣe o le ma pada wa.
Everyone loves them.	Gbogbo eniyan feran wọn.
They are used to groups of people.	Wọn ti lo si awọn ẹgbẹ ti eniyan.
Just the same thing in every city.	O kan ohun kanna ni gbogbo ilu.
As soon as he saw it, it was obvious.	Ni kete ti o rii, o han gbangba.
It does because people want to.	O ṣe nitori eniyan fẹ lati.
It is my job.	O jẹ iṣẹ mi.
Something special to do.	Nkankan pataki lati ṣe.
But better try.	Sugbon dara gbiyanju.
This cannot happen.	Eyi ko le ṣẹlẹ.
Just not like your others.	O kan ko dabi awọn miiran rẹ.
Not pretty at all.	Ko lẹwa ni gbogbo.
That is very important to my book.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki pupọ si iwe mi.
Everything about them is true.	Ohun gbogbo nipa wọn wa ni otitọ.
Wa fo soke.	Wa fo soke.
It doesn't have a good plan.	Ko ni eto to dara.
He was a little boy in a new position.	O jẹ ọmọ kekere ni ipo tuntun.
Please do not ask me to move.	Jọwọ, maṣe beere fun mi lati gbe.
Many students walked across it on their way into the building.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe rin kọja rẹ ni ọna wọn sinu ile naa.
It is not a wonderful and special time.	Kii ṣe akoko iyanu ati pataki.
This is how it should be done.	Eyi ni bi o ṣe yẹ ki o ṣe.
Your eyes are gone.	Oju rẹ ti lọ.
But we have a lot of other meetings today.	Ṣugbọn a ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ipade miiran loni.
If so, everyone will.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, gbogbo eniyan yoo ṣe.
No, you made no mistake.	Rara, o ko ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
He never used it.	Ko lo o rara.
Or maybe he was afraid to get into trouble.	Tabi boya o bẹru lati lọ sinu wahala.
You have to make a decision.	O ni lati ṣe ipinnu.
I can't tell you.	Nko le so fun rara.
He always knew he was there for the team.	O nigbagbogbo mọ pe o wa nibẹ fun ẹgbẹ naa.
There is also an advantage.	Anfani tun wa.
You have to keep your eyes peeled.	O ni lati pa oju rẹ mọ.
A big big big.	Nla nla nla kan.
Change yourself openly.	Yi ara rẹ pada ni gbangba.
It is an opportunity that one should not miss.	O jẹ anfani ti eniyan ko yẹ ki o padanu.
But if someone takes the new idea away, fine.	Ṣugbọn ti ẹnikan ba gba imọran tuntun kuro, o dara.
We should ask for a meeting with you.	A yẹ ki o beere fun ipade pẹlu rẹ.
There is a place I want to return to.	Ibi kan wa ti Mo fẹ lati pada si.
We have done what we can.	A ti ṣe ohun ti a le.
And use them regularly.	Ki o si lo wọn nigbagbogbo.
Some refuse to withdraw.	Diẹ ninu awọn kọ lati yọ kuro.
Much, much less.	Elo, Elo kere.
I do not need classes now.	Emi ko nilo awon kilasi bayi.
They would have known all this information and more.	Wọn yoo ti mọ gbogbo alaye yii ati diẹ sii.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	O dabi ẹni pe o dun.
The job requires someone to travel regularly.	Iṣẹ naa nilo ẹnikan lati rin irin-ajo nigbagbogbo.
So he decided to make his own.	Nitorina o pinnu lati ṣe ti ara rẹ.
But tell me about it.	Ṣugbọn sọ fun mi nipa rẹ.
We do this in two ways.	A ṣe eyi ni ọna meji.
He seemed wondering how he could tell me.	O dabi enipe o ṣe iyalẹnu bi o ṣe le sọ fun mi.
The price range is very high.	Owo ibiti o jẹ gaan ga.
That string became my best friend.	Okun yẹn di ọrẹ mi to dara julọ.
That is tomorrow.	Iyẹn jẹ ọla.
Would like to know if it is so or not.	Yoo fẹ lati mọ boya o jẹ bẹ tabi rara.
For my mother, it wasn’t great.	Fun iya mi, kii ṣe nla.
With your help, we can get out in public.	Pẹlu iranlọwọ rẹ, a le gba jade ni gbangba.
I know you are right.	Mo mọ pe o tọ.
But they are not the only ones.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe wọn nikan.
These questions have been resolved.	A ti pinnu awọn ibeere wọnyi.
The more you are.	Awọn diẹ ti o ba wa.
I believe my face changed in a few minutes.	Mo gbagbọ pe oju mi ​​yipada ni iṣẹju diẹ.
Students are here to work and live.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe wa nibi lati ṣiṣẹ ati gbe.
You will find what you need.	Iwọ yoo wa ohun ti o nilo.
I think the city did well.	Mo ro pe ilu naa ṣe daradara.
Only when needed.	Nikan nigbati o nilo.
And a lot of work.	Ati ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ.
We want to run on this.	A fẹ lati ṣiṣe lori eyi.
You don't want to go back.	O ko fẹ lati pada.
Some do not.	Diẹ ninu awọn ko ṣe.
Every day there are new things to see.	Ni gbogbo ọjọ awọn ohun tuntun wa lati rii.
He walks a lot.	O rin pupọ.
That will not change anything.	Iyẹn kii yoo yi ohunkohun pada.
She slammed the door.	O yara ti ilẹkun rẹ.
You may also want to read this new book.	O tun le fẹ lati ka iwe tuntun yii.
He did not come to me.	Ko wa si mi.
I shouldn’t get to go down in mine.	Emi ko yẹ ki o gba lati lọ si isalẹ ninu awọn mi.
You will add them.	O yoo fi wọn si.
We must use both of these methods.	A gbọdọ lo awọn ọna mejeeji wọnyi.
However, this work is not appropriate.	Sibẹsibẹ, iṣẹ yii ko yẹ.
Now we know why.	Bayi a mọ idi.
Something in his tone forced him to stop.	Nkankan ninu ohun orin rẹ fi agbara mu u lati da.
He attached them.	O so mọ wọn.
But something to think about, something to remember.	Sugbon nkankan lati ro lori, nkankan lati ranti.
My dog ​​is my new shoe.	Aja mi jẹ bata tuntun mi.
I think you even told him about it.	Mo ro pe o paapaa sọ fun u nipa rẹ.
You do not have to accept.	O ko ni lati gba.
We will put that one at a time.	A yoo fi iyẹn si ọkan nigba miiran.
Buy something for your wife.	Ra nkan fun iyawo re.
But you should expect that.	Ṣugbọn o yẹ ki o nireti iyẹn.
How can we sit back and do nothing.	Bawo ni a ṣe le joko sẹhin ki a ṣe ohunkohun.
He remembers this summer's holiday.	O ranti isinmi igba ooru yii.
I finished it myself, in a way.	Mo ti pari funrararẹ, ni ọna kan.
I am not in a car.	Emi ko wa ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
People are afraid of heights.	Awọn eniyan bẹru awọn giga.
I just love working with it.	Mo kan nifẹ ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
I see he is dead.	Mo n rii pe o ku.
Just start a story.	O kan bẹrẹ itan kan.
You need to work hard.	O nilo lati ṣiṣẹ ni agbara.
It stands to reason.	O duro si akiyesi.
Now it’s time for a new team.	Bayi o jẹ akoko ti ẹgbẹ tuntun kan.
I am among the best of them.	Mo wa ninu awọn ti o dara julọ ninu wọn.
So, what do you mean?	Nitorina, kini o tumọ si?
You know best and will not always do as you wish.	O mọ julọ ati pe yoo ma ṣe nigbagbogbo bi o ṣe fẹ.
I always take them three at a time.	Mo nigbagbogbo mu wọn mẹta ni akoko kan.
I had to make a purchase of those verses.	Mo ni lati ṣe ifẹ si awọn ẹsẹ yẹn.
They arrived by plane.	Wọn de nipasẹ ọkọ ofurufu.
They are not needed in the body.	Wọn ko nilo ninu ara.
I use it for running only.	Mo lo fun ṣiṣe nikan.
I didn’t tell any of the boys in my class.	Emi ko sọ fun eyikeyi ninu awọn ọmọkunrin ni kilasi mi.
It makes sense, in its own way.	O ṣe oye, ni ọna rẹ.
They make us happy.	Wọn jẹ ki inu wa dun.
In winter.	Ni igba otutu.
I love this moment.	Mo nifẹ akoko yii.
With one hand.	Pẹlu ọwọ kan.
You should keep this person in your life.	O yẹ ki o tọju eniyan yii ni igbesi aye rẹ.
You just need to look around.	O kan nilo lati wo ni ayika rẹ.
Can add more if desired.	Le fi diẹ kun ti o ba fẹ.
Teachers are young.	Awọn olukọ jẹ ọdọ.
Books don’t make sense.	Awọn iwe ko ni ṣe ori.
This works at this time.	Eyi ṣiṣẹ ni akoko yii.
I would really like to see that.	Emi yoo fẹ gaan lati rii iyẹn.
There are some things that are difficult to do.	Awọn nkan kan wa ti o nira lati ṣe.
We were always under fire.	A wà labẹ ina nigbagbogbo.
We'll just see what happens.	A yoo kan wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It doesn't really help.	Ko ṣe iranlọwọ gaan.
See it.	Wo e.
He did not notice me.	Ko ṣe akiyesi mi.
It did nothing for him.	Ko ṣe nkankan fun u.
Its benefits are the cost.	Awọn anfani rẹ jẹ iye owo naa.
So they say.	Nitorina wọn sọ.
Take advantage too much.	Ṣe anfani pupọ julọ.
He is accepted in his work.	O ti gba ninu iṣẹ rẹ.
Let my other friends go.	Jẹ ki awọn ọrẹ mi miiran lọ.
We still have some time.	A tun ni akoko diẹ.
The house is very nice.	Ile naa dara gaan.
I’m not even sure you like it.	Emi ko paapaa daju pe o fẹran rẹ.
Some of them tried.	Diẹ ninu wọn gbiyanju.
It is my favorite food!	O jẹ ounjẹ ounjẹ ayanfẹ mi!
And don't let up.	Ati ki o ko jẹ ki soke.
I hate people.	Mo korira eniyan.
I think this is just great.	Mo ro pe eyi jẹ nla nikan.
Very nice and helpful person.	Eniyan dara pupọ ati iranlọwọ.
Make me afraid.	Mu mi bẹru.
But no fire.	Sugbon ko si ina.
In this, but not in everything.	Ninu eyi, ṣugbọn kii ṣe ninu ohun gbogbo.
Turn off the heat.	Pa ooru naa.
Take your time.	Gba akoko rẹ.
I think he would ask.	Mo ro pe oun yoo beere.
I asked him what he wanted.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ pe kini o fẹ.
You must walk.	O gbọdọ rin.
Hard on him.	Lile lori rẹ.
It may have been.	O le ti wa.
I knew the man face to face.	Mo mọ ọkunrin naa ni oju.
An old car.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ atijọ kan.
The best way to find love is to be yourself.	Ọna ti o dara julọ lati wa ifẹ ni lati jẹ funrararẹ.
It seems that people want more than they need.	O dabi pe eniyan fẹ diẹ sii ju ti wọn nilo lọ.
He pulled himself back and thought of himself.	O fa ara rẹ pada o si ronu ti ara rẹ.
No, it has nothing to do with us.	Rara, ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu wa.
Sorry, there is a problem.	Ma binu, iṣoro kan wa.
They say they have to work soon.	Wọn sọ pe wọn ni lati ṣiṣẹ laipẹ.
You can have children.	O le ni awọn ọmọde.
We have a family.	A ni idile.
It comes in handy.	O wa ni ọwọ.
They are all money.	Gbogbo wọn jẹ owo.
A moment seems to stop here.	Akoko kan dabi pe o da duro nibi.
Okay, as we did as it was going to get.	O dara, bi a ti ṣe bi o ti n lọ lati gba.
At first, they did not notice it at all.	Ni akọkọ, wọn ko ṣe akiyesi rẹ rara.
And we don’t have that.	Ati pe a ko ni iyẹn.
He would have had a meeting with her.	Oun yoo ti kan ipade pẹlu rẹ.
Iron ore is used to make steel.	Irin irin ni a lo lati ṣe irin.
We can continue for a long time.	A le tẹsiwaju fun igba pipẹ.
Get off the road.	Lọ kuro ni opopona.
And yet, it felt like a bad thing.	Ati sibẹsibẹ, o ro bi ohun buburu.
Such a thing happens.	Iru nkan bẹẹ ṣẹlẹ.
He gave me a moment.	O fun mi ni akoko kan.
Or drive where we want to.	Tabi wakọ ibi ti a fẹ.
I do not know why he did that.	Emi ko mọ idi ti o ṣe bẹ naa.
It is not always that relaxation.	Kii ṣe nigbagbogbo pe isinmi.
My gift is not for you, it is for my children.	Ẹbun mi kii ṣe fun ọ, o jẹ ti awọn ọmọ mi.
See history.	Wo itan.
We decided to think about it tomorrow.	A pinnu lati ronu nipa rẹ ni ọla.
They keep everyone inside.	Wọn pa gbogbo eniyan mọ inu.
That, for me, is your point.	Iyẹn, fun mi, ni aaye rẹ.
I took it below.	Mo mu ni isalẹ.
In that song there is rest.	Ninu orin yẹn isinmi wa.
So, what do we do now?	Nitorina, kini a ṣe ni bayi?
I have things to do.	Mo ni awọn nkan lati ṣe.
You are wrong.	O ni aṣiṣe.
I'll sit on that right now.	Emi yoo joko lori iyẹn ni bayi.
There is a lot of water in the boxes.	Omi pupọ wa ninu awọn apoti naa.
Before you go you change.	Ṣaaju ki o to lọ o yipada.
We have seen that.	A ti rii pe.
I can't find anything, either.	Emi ko le ri nkankan, boya.
The house is still there today.	Ile si tun wa loni.
Which you will not really like.	Eyi ti iwọ kii yoo nifẹ gaan.
All three games were sold.	Gbogbo awọn ere mẹta ni wọn ta.
Go the other way, it is below.	Lọ si ọna miiran, o wa ni isalẹ.
I am here on vacation.	Mo wa nibi isinmi ile.
Now that is gone.	Bayi iyẹn ti lọ.
This is a big problem.	Eyi ni iṣoro nla.
Do it with it.	Ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
At least on paper.	O kere ju lori iwe.
That was his first and last mistake.	Iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe akọkọ ati ikẹhin rẹ.
And maybe it's worth it.	Ati boya o tọ.
Most people find the task difficult.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan rii iṣẹ naa nira.
I grew up and you are young.	Mo ti dagba ati pe iwọ jẹ ọdọ.
So we want to go this route.	Nitorina a fẹ lati lọ si ọna yii.
It could be wrong.	O le jẹ aṣiṣe.
That may be good, it may not be.	Iyẹn le dara, o le ma jẹ.
He has power.	O ni agbara.
The water in the eyeball is clean water.	Omi inu bọọlu oju jẹ omi ti o mọ.
It seems the wrong place.	O dabi ibi ti ko tọ.
It seemed like he wanted to keep me alive.	O dabi ẹni pe o fẹ jẹ mi laaye.
Another did something else.	Miiran ṣe nkan miiran.
So, what are we going to do about it?	Nitorina, kini a yoo ṣe nipa rẹ?
And there is nothing more certain.	Ati pe ko si ohun ti o daju diẹ sii.
There are three major ones.	Nibẹ ni o wa pataki mẹta.
To go home, that is.	Lati lọ si ile, iyẹn ni.
And maybe in your mind, it seems that way.	Ati boya ninu ọkan rẹ, o dabi pe ọna naa.
I made sense to get back on the job.	Mo mi ori lati gba pada lori ise.
We will be like brothers that day.	A yoo dabi arakunrin ni ọjọ yẹn.
I tell you.	Mo so fun e.
Make your plan into it.	Ṣe eto rẹ sinu.
And this place is important enough.	Ati ibi yi jẹ pataki to.
Life is more important.	Igbesi aye jẹ pataki diẹ sii.
Much of this work has now been completed.	Pupọ ninu iṣẹ yii ti pari ni bayi.
I know this is wrong.	Mo mọ pe eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
But one of these games is enough.	Ṣugbọn ọkan ninu awọn ere wọnyi ti to.
She loves it and can't wait to go again.	O nifẹ rẹ ko si le duro lati lọ lẹẹkansi.
Our site is nothing without it.	Aaye wa jẹ ohunkohun laisi rẹ.
I didn't tell you what to say anymore.	Emi ko sọ fun ọ kini lati sọ mọ.
I will never make that mistake again.	Emi kii yoo ṣe aṣiṣe yẹn lẹẹkansi.
And no one to change.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan lati yi.
Or maybe not everyone knows that.	Tabi boya gbogbo eniyan ko mọ iyẹn.
His hand is on my foot.	Ọwọ rẹ wa lori ẹsẹ mi.
He used to worry about that fact, all the time.	O lo lati ṣe aniyan nipa otitọ yẹn, ni gbogbo igba.
What is possible.	Kini o ṣee ṣe.
If news needs to find a way to me, it does.	Ti awọn iroyin ba nilo lati wa ọna si mi, o ṣe.
What is not clear is why.	Ohun ti ko han gbangba ni idi.
She wanted to ask him, but he knew he couldn't talk.	O fẹ lati beere lọwọ rẹ, ṣugbọn o mọ pe ko le sọrọ.
I think we will have to wait and see.	Mo ro pe a yoo ni lati duro ati rii.
They just help them back.	Wọn kan ran wọn pada.
Don't send me to the police anymore.	Maṣe fi mi ranṣẹ si ọlọpa mọ.
My boat came with one and it was great to have.	Ọkọ oju omi mi wa pẹlu ọkan ati pe o jẹ nla lati ni.
Some of the man's life was in them.	Diẹ ninu igbesi aye ọkunrin naa wa ninu wọn.
This is not my opinion.	Eyi kii ṣe ero mi.
Do the same for them.	Ṣe kanna fun wọn.
It’s on you.	O wa lori rẹ.
They will have more.	Wọn yoo ni diẹ sii.
Everyone knows everything.	Gbogbo eniyan lo mọ ohun gbogbo.
Take this, boy.	Mu eyi, ọmọkunrin.
You agree with the picture.	O gba pẹlu aworan naa.
The doctors promised to treat her.	Awọn dokita ṣe ileri lati tọju rẹ.
Not bad for not doing much.	Ko ṣe buburu fun ko ṣe pupọ.
I mean, not good at all.	Mo tumọ si, ko dara rara.
Okay, but it sounds good now.	O dara, ṣugbọn o ti dun ni bayi.
But it's worth it.	Sugbon o tọ o.
And of course, that's right.	Ati pe dajudaju, iyẹn tọ.
Obviously this is becoming more important with age.	O han ni eyi n di pataki pẹlu ọjọ ori.
Not too much has changed.	Ko ju Elo ti yi pada.
I asked the man to please open the door.	Mo beere lọwọ ọkunrin naa lati jọwọ ṣii ilẹkun.
So it takes time.	Nitorina o gba akoko.
I do not want you to be like this.	Emi ko fẹ ki o wa iru eyi.
But there is not much time for that.	Ṣugbọn ko si akoko pupọ fun iyẹn.
If you go out.	Ti o ba jade.
Don’t look at them as too high or too confident.	Maṣe wo wọn bi ẹni ti o ga ju tabi ti o ni idaniloju.
Sorry about that mistake.	Ma binu nipa aṣiṣe naa.
But nothing could have been done.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohunkohun ti o le ti ṣe.
School is out.	Ile-iwe ti jade.
Much more true.	Pupọ diẹ sii ni otitọ.
Of course he will.	Dajudaju oun yoo.
It was a good day.	O jẹ ọjọ ti o dara.
So be it as you wish.	Nitorina jẹ bi o ṣe fẹ.
It was the most important meal of your day.	O jẹ ounjẹ pataki julọ ti ọjọ rẹ.
They don’t like what you do to them.	Wọn ko fẹran ohun ti o ṣe si wọn.
I am the only one.	Emi nikan niyen.
It’s not about the materials.	Kii ṣe nipa awọn ohun elo.
Everyone wants to do better.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ lati ṣe dara julọ.
It feels good.	O n rilara ti o dara.
It would seem correct.	Yoo dabi pe o tọ.
They take care of it but it is a job.	Wọn tọju rẹ ṣugbọn o jẹ iṣẹ kan.
He can not stop.	Ko le da duro mọ.
You can hear yours now.	O le gbọ tirẹ ni bayi.
We will not do it.	A ko ni ṣe.
They are interested in.	Wọn nifẹ ninu.
He knows what he has in his wife.	O mọ ohun ti o ni ninu iyawo rẹ.
I say no, again.	Mo sọ rara, lẹẹkansi.
He is dead!	O ti ku!
I know you will come back.	Mo mọ pe iwọ yoo pada.
But when he saw me, he was afraid.	Ṣugbọn nigbati o ri mi, o jẹ ẹni ti o bẹru.
It makes the game a lot easier.	O jẹ ki ere naa rọrun pupọ.
Just time.	O kan akoko.
But we no longer work for ourselves.	Ṣugbọn a ko ṣiṣẹ fun ara wa mọ.
Enjoy it now, because soon it will go away forever.	Gbadun rẹ ni bayi, nitori laipẹ o yoo lọ lailai.
Break before the last three songs.	Adehun ṣaaju awọn orin mẹta ti o kẹhin.
It will be tested by the weather.	O yoo ni idanwo nipasẹ oju ojo.
Either way, these are community members.	Ọna boya, awọn wọnyi ni awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ agbegbe.
The baby moved to rest.	Ọmọ naa gbe lọ ni isinmi.
We will tell the truth.	A yoo sọ otitọ.
I’m not sure what more to say about it.	Emi ko rii daju kini diẹ sii lati sọ nipa rẹ.
People are not allowed to eat here.	Wọn ko gba eniyan laaye lati jẹun nibi.
Why he didn't say anything, he wondered.	Kini idi ti ko sọ ohunkohun, o ṣe iyalẹnu.
I live in a small house.	Mo n gbe ni kekere kan ile.
He took some pictures.	O si mu diẹ ninu awọn aworan.
And, it is not a question.	Ati, kii ṣe ibeere kan.
I just look at it.	Mo kan wo rẹ.
It makes me feel.	O mu mi lero.
You know everything you need to know.	O mọ ohun gbogbo ti o nilo lati mọ.
I feel like a child again.	Mo lero bi ọmọ lẹẹkansi.
At his father's house.	Ni ile baba rẹ.
My parents decided they wanted to beat.	Awọn obi mi pinnu pe wọn fẹ lati lu.
Switch one to a higher setting and watch.	Yipada ọkan si eto giga kan ki o wo.
You will notice this device to the device.	Iwọ yoo ṣe akiyesi ẹrọ yii si ẹrọ.
You can’t go wrong when you do.	Ko le ṣe aṣiṣe nigbati o ba ṣe.
It can make anyone believe.	O le jẹ ki ẹnikẹni gbagbọ.
I read this book in a single go.	Mo ti ka iwe yi ni kan nikan lọ.
Continue.	Tẹsiwaju.
Her mother didn’t want me to do it.	Iya rẹ ko fẹ ki n ṣe.
Learn the simple way.	Kọ ẹkọ ọna ti o rọrun.
See the documentation of the project for more details.	Wo iwe ti iṣẹ naa fun awọn alaye diẹ sii.
Let's go for a walk.	Jẹ ki a lọ fun rin.
It would have taken them a few minutes.	Yoo ti gba wọn iṣẹju diẹ.
She was afraid to be there.	O bẹru lati wa nibẹ.
Something stopped me.	Nkankan da mi duro.
We went boating one day.	A lọ ọkọ oju omi ni ọjọ kan.
We can leave in the morning.	A le lọ kuro ni owurọ.
I am not one of those people.	Emi kii ṣe ọkan ninu awọn eniyan yẹn.
They did not know it was there.	Wọn ko mọ pe o wa nibẹ.
It was nice to see you.	O ti dun lati ri ọ.
I need a cup of tea.	Mo nilo ife tii kan.
I understand and decide.	Mo loye ati pinnu.
It means low cost.	O tumọ si iye owo kekere.
I can not accept this anymore!	Emi ko le gba eyi mọ!
He is with me every day.	O wa pẹlu mi ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Please try not to get up.	Jọwọ gbiyanju lati ma dide si.
He looks great.	O dabi ẹni nla.
So your work is cut off for you.	Nitorina a ge iṣẹ rẹ kuro fun ọ.
It was the last day of school.	O jẹ ọjọ ti o kẹhin ti ile-iwe.
Such great games are unheard of.	Iru awọn ere nla bẹẹ ko gbọ.
I think there is something good.	Mo ro pe nkan to dara wa.
That is my real problem.	Iyẹn ni wahala mi gaan.
One thing to keep in mind is the age of the child.	Ohun kan ti o yẹ ki o ronu ni ọjọ ori ọmọ naa.
But we stopped.	Sugbon a duro.
That sounds weird.	Iyẹn dabi akiyesi.
He entered the small house.	O wọ inu ile kekere naa.
He didn’t have football last season.	O ko ni bọọlu ni akoko to kọja.
He will think.	Yoo ro ero.
I do not want to go back to my room.	Emi ko fẹ lati pada si yara mi.
He was a very strong man.	O jẹ ọkunrin lile pupọ.
I know better now.	Mo mọ dara julọ ni bayi.
All working words.	Gbogbo awọn ọrọ ṣiṣe.
This moment is your life.	Akoko yii ni igbesi aye rẹ.
I think if we meet, it will hit me.	Mo ro pe ti a ba pade, o yoo lu mi.
And you do not.	Ati pe iwọ ko ṣe.
They are desires.	Wọn jẹ awọn ifẹ.
It is very difficult today to find good teachers.	O nira pupọ loni lati wa awọn olukọ ti o dara.
It explains things.	O ṣe alaye awọn nkan.
But that was enough.	Sugbon ti o wà to.
This time he was sure he had heard something.	Ni akoko yii o ni idaniloju pe o ti gbọ nkan kan.
I do not doubt it.	Emi ko ṣiyemeji rẹ.
It tastes great.	O dun pupo.
For real, space is great.	Fun otitọ, aaye jẹ nla.
He did everything hard.	O ṣe ohun gbogbo lile.
I like what you do.	Mo fẹran ohun ti o ṣe.
Your drink is gone.	Ohun mimu rẹ ti lọ.
He said no.	O sọ rara.
I just can't believe it.	Mo kan ko le gbagbọ.
Or what it means to lose your child.	Tabi kini o tumọ si lati padanu ọmọ rẹ.
The book contains a lot of factual information.	Iwe naa ni ọpọlọpọ alaye ti o daju.
You will draw through this.	Iwọ yoo fa nipasẹ eyi.
They do not end in themselves.	Wọn ko pari ni ara wọn.
I do not know where they are.	Emi ko mọ ibiti wọn lọ.
No forward thinking, no question.	Ko si ero iwaju, ko si ibeere.
You can not imagine what the situation really looks like.	O ko le ṣe akiyesi kini ipo naa dabi gaan.
You know you can.	O mọ pe o le.
The whole scene changed.	Gbogbo oju yi pada.
That alone is not an easy task.	Iyẹn nikan kii ṣe iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
The feet are now.	Awọn ẹsẹ wa ni bayi.
In the morning, we got up early.	Ni owurọ, a dide ni kutukutu.
You don’t see anyone you know to sit with.	O ko ri enikeni ti o mọ lati joko pẹlu.
That could not be better.	Iyẹn ko le dara.
I think that will help me improve.	Mo ro pe iyẹn yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi lati dara si.
He gave me tea in the living room.	O fun mi ni tii ninu yara ijoko.
Which is not possible.	Eyi ti ko ṣee ṣe.
We did not find any.	A ko rii eyikeyi.
Look, you just can.	Wo, o kan le.
That has already happened.	To ti ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
It begins to rise.	O bẹrẹ lati dide.
He looked at the letter.	O wo lẹta naa.
We may ask for more money if needed.	A le beere fun owo diẹ sii ti o ba nilo.
You do not understand the question.	O ko loye ibeere naa.
You have to come to your senses.	O gbọdọ wa si ori ara rẹ.
He is having fun with his son.	O si n gbadun pẹlu ọmọ rẹ.
That is, anything that may seem or feel the same.	O tumọ si, ohunkohun ti o le dabi tabi rilara kanna.
But really what they can say.	Sugbon gan ohun ti won le so.
Even from yourself.	Paapaa lati ara rẹ.
This may have its advantages.	Eyi le ni awọn anfani tirẹ.
Take the seats.	Mu awọn ijoko.
Either way, the woman lost.	Ọna boya, obinrin padanu.
Would love to see more of this !.	Yoo nifẹ lati rii diẹ sii ti eyi !.
You have to have both.	O ni lati ni awọn mejeeji.
Most boys my age know his father.	Pupọ julọ awọn ọmọkunrin ti ọjọ ori mi mọ baba rẹ.
They listen to music.	Wọn gbọ orin.
He took it.	O mu o.
Soon they became friends.	Laipẹ wọn di ọrẹ.
So no problem there.	Nitorina ko si iṣoro nibẹ.
But the facts do.	Ṣugbọn awọn otitọ ṣe.
Change the text in the box.	Yi ọrọ pada ninu apoti.
I can't stand it anymore.	Nko le duro mo.
For him to say, be very observant.	Fun u lati sọ, jẹ ohun akiyesi pupọ.
Long days now.	Awọn ọjọ gun ni bayi.
You can make games.	O le ṣe awọn ere.
By me, first.	Nipasẹ mi, ni akọkọ.
You have seen me grow.	O ti ri mi dagba.
That should be sufficient enough to make the store feel smaller.	Iyẹn ti to lati jẹ ki ile itaja rilara pe o kere ju.
Maybe you sit down and read a book together.	Boya o joko ati ka iwe kan papọ.
It could have happened to anyone.	O le ti ṣẹlẹ si ẹnikẹni.
You have the opportunity.	O ni anfani.
Many, therefore, were arrested.	Ọpọlọpọ, nitorina, ni a mu.
No money is coming out of the system.	Ko si owo ti wa ni bọ jade ti awọn eto.
Wash me or walk away.	Fo mi tabi rin kuro.
I'm sure it will last long enough.	Mo da mi loju pe yoo pẹ to.
It should be you.	O yẹ ki o jẹ iwọ.
Holidays will be even hotter this year.	Awọn isinmi yoo paapaa gbona ni ọdun yii.
Power has changed.	Agbara ti yipada.
Is not their type.	Ṣe kii ṣe iru wọn.
There is nothing there.	Ko si nkankan nibẹ.
I am coming back to life.	Mo n pada wa si aye.
What is your opinion?	Kini ero rẹ?
I got it, he was in high school.	Mo ni i, o wa ni ile-iwe giga.
Eyes are on him.	Awọn oju ti wa lori rẹ.
I have spoken to many of them.	Mo ti sọrọ si ọpọlọpọ awọn ti wọn.
Not on purpose.	Ko lori idi.
He went out, left the door.	O jade lọ, o fi ilẹkun silẹ.
Do not leave this to chance.	Maṣe fi eyi silẹ.
You will come out.	Iwọ yoo jade.
That is the end of the story.	Ipari itan naa niyen.
But that's not what it was about.	Ṣugbọn ti o ni ko ohun ti o wà nipa.
It can't be anything.	Ko le jẹ nkankan.
He is angry.	O binu.
It was a nice day and we enjoyed the sun.	O jẹ ọjọ ti o dara ati pe a gbadun oorun.
He will be back home next week.	Oun yoo pada si ile ni ọsẹ ti n bọ.
All climbers need the right equipment.	Gbogbo awọn ti n gun oke nilo ohun elo to tọ.
And there is something else about it, too.	Ati pe nkan miiran wa nipa rẹ, paapaa.
And the same holds true for parent groups.	Ati awọn kanna Oun ni otitọ fun awọn ẹgbẹ obi.
If you can not find it.	Ti o ko ba le ri a.
His father too.	Baba rẹ pẹlu.
Find some in the first year.	Wa diẹ ninu ọdun akọkọ.
It's out well now.	O ti jade daradara ni bayi.
Here is what comes down to it.	Eyi ni ohun ti o wa si isalẹ.
I think you can not do that.	Mo ro pe o ko le ṣe bẹ.
She loves to treat others.	O nifẹ lati tọju awọn miiran.
We are looking for a boat down the river.	A wa ọkọ isalẹ odo.
Walk off into the night.	Rin si pa sinu alẹ.
I don’t know anything else to tell you.	Emi ko mọ ohunkohun miiran lati so fun o.
We want to touch.	A fẹ lati fi ọwọ kan.
To get off this mountain is hard.	Lati lọ kuro ni oke yii jẹ lile.
Insert for a week.	Fi sii fun ọsẹ kan.
You are not in it.	O ko ni ninu rẹ.
So it is no wonder why we lost.	Nitorina o jẹ ko si iyanu idi ti a padanu.
The first thing is the situation.	Ohun akọkọ ni ipo.
But the mother did not ask.	Ṣugbọn iya ko beere.
Try it and let me know how it works out.	Gbiyanju o ki o jẹ ki mi mọ bi o ti ṣiṣẹ jade.
I love your sound.	Mo nifẹ ohun rẹ.
But it will not be long.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo pẹ.
You know me better than that.	O mọ mi ju iyẹn lọ.
I did not kill him.	Emi ko pa a.
Tomorrow the weather may change.	Ni ọla oju ojo le yipada.
That doesn't matter now.	Iyẹn ko ṣe pataki ni bayi.
Just hate work.	O kan korira iṣẹ.
I have to leave now.	Mo ni lati lọ kuro ni bayi.
You may have seen such.	O le ti rii iru bẹ.
He felt like a man.	O ro bi ọkunrin kan ṣe.
There is only water now.	Omi nikan lo wa bayi.
I caught some.	Mo ti mu diẹ ninu awọn.
Maybe too much.	Boya pupo ju.
He did everything we needed to do.	O ṣe ohun gbogbo ti a nilo lati ṣe.
I mean, look at these two.	Mo tumọ si, wo awọn meji wọnyi.
I will do it again.	Emi yoo tun ṣe.
You have to move it.	O ni lati gbe rẹ.
This work must be completed tomorrow.	Iṣẹ yii gbọdọ pari ni ọla.
Do not say a word to anyone.	Maṣe sọ ọrọ kan si eniyan.
I have some work to do.	Mo ni iṣẹ diẹ lati ṣe.
The fact is that they were taken for an hour.	Otitọ ni pe wọn ya wọn fun wakati kan.
I do not know anything.	Nko mo nkankan.
That makes it even more difficult.	Iyẹn jẹ ki o nira diẹ sii.
But it was hard to.	Sugbon o je gidigidi lati.
They can kill and kill and no one knows.	Wọn le pa ati pa ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ.
That is work and life.	Iyẹn jẹ iṣẹ ṣiṣe ati igbesi aye.
And he loved it.	O si feran re.
There are many of them.	Ọpọlọpọ wọn wa.
If the path does not appear, drag.	Ti ọna naa ko ba han, fa.
We like to go game after game.	A fẹ lati lọ ere lẹhin ti ere.
These problems are only minor.	Awọn iṣoro wọnyi jẹ kekere nikan.
The sister does this all the time.	Arabinrin naa ṣe eyi ni gbogbo igba.
We would be very good without it.	A yoo dara pupọ laisi rẹ.
This is, see.	Eyi ni, wo.
She loves what the doctor says.	O nifẹ ohun ti dokita n sọ.
No one has seen or heard from her in two days.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ti ri tabi gbọ lati rẹ ni ọjọ meji.
I am very sorry.	Mo binu gidigidi.
Only your father can.	Baba rẹ nikan ni o le.
Their lives are in their hands.	A fi aye won pada si ọwọ wọn.
Obviously, it can't be either.	O han ni, ko le jẹ boya.
Minimum service.	Iṣẹ ti o kere julọ.
I need to get out of here.	Mo nilo lati jade ni ibi.
We are staying home next week.	A n gbe ile ni ọsẹ to nbọ.
This is an amazing book.	Eyi jẹ iwe iyalẹnu kan.
I want to kill him.	Mo fe pa a.
It is still there for a while.	O tun wa fun igba diẹ.
Just come out.	O kan wa jade.
He took the matter seriously.	O gba ọrọ naa ni pataki.
I'll come get you when it's over.	Emi yoo wa gba ọ nigbati o ba pari.
It would have been nice.	Yoo ti dara.
Now can not see.	Bayi ko le ri.
I doubt that will happen.	Mo ṣiyemeji iyẹn yoo ṣẹlẹ.
They are my friends.	Awọn ọrẹ mi ni.
There is something you know about the man's name.	Ohun kan wa ti o mọ nipa orukọ ọkunrin naa.
We are not sure what we think about that.	A ko ni idaniloju ohun ti a ro nipa iyẹn.
Some are known for their wisdom.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti a mọ fun ọgbọn wọn.
Or know it.	Tabi mọ ọ.
You can let me know when it’s over.	O le jẹ ki mi mọ nigbati o ba ti pari.
I do not accept that we are doing it because it is simple.	Emi ko gba pe a n ṣe nitori pe o rọrun.
Go with my mom and many other people.	Lọ pẹlu iya mi ati ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan miiran.
Most men like to run from the back.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkunrin fẹran ṣiṣe lati ẹhin.
I can not sleep.	Nko le sun.
I made your dinner.	Mo ṣe ounjẹ alẹ rẹ.
It is a beautiful old house.	O ti wa ni a lẹwa atijọ ile.
Can we go to dinner?	Ṣe a le lọ si ounjẹ alẹ?
You can even say something.	O le paapaa sọ nkankan.
My father was one of them.	Baba mi jẹ ọkan ninu wọn.
You should have thought more of it.	O yẹ ki o ti ronu diẹ sii si rẹ.
His house is a small house on the outskirts of town.	Ile rẹ jẹ ile kekere kan ti o wa ni ita ilu.
Our situation has become unbearable.	Ipo wa ti di ohun ti ko le duro.
Do not hurt him.	Maṣe ṣe ipalara fun u.
For a better understanding I am with two pictures here.	Fun oye to dara julọ Mo wa pẹlu aworan meji nibi.
That he has enough money that he does not need to work anymore.	Wipe o ni owo to pe ko nilo lati ṣiṣẹ mọ.
Classes must contain at least the first letter in capital letters.	Awọn kilasi gbọdọ ni o kere ju lẹta akọkọ ni ọrọ nla.
Now this is something that will make a wonderful gift.	Bayi eyi jẹ nkan ti yoo ṣe ẹbun iyanu.
That feels great.	Iyẹn jẹ rilara ti o dara julọ.
I was never happy with anything in my life.	Inu mi ko dun rara pẹlu ohunkohun ninu igbesi aye mi.
Lessons continue today.	Awọn ẹkọ tun tẹsiwaju loni.
There was too.	Nibẹ wà ju.
Or football either.	Tabi bọọlu boya.
It may have played well, and still missed.	O le ti dun daradara, ki o si tun padanu.
There seems to be a lot we do not know about it.	O dabi pe ọpọlọpọ wa ti a ko mọ nipa rẹ.
I do not want to get married.	Emi ko fẹ lati ṣe igbeyawo.
They must continue their work.	Wọn gbọdọ tẹsiwaju iṣẹ wọn.
Good with your hands.	O dara pẹlu ọwọ rẹ.
The cat entered the house, leaving his feet behind.	Ologbo naa wọ inu ile, o fi ẹsẹ rẹ silẹ.
But that is not the case.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe bii o ṣe ri.
It is the most important place in our lives.	O jẹ aaye pataki julọ ni igbesi aye wa.
He took it from her before she spoke again.	O mu lati inu rẹ ṣaaju ki o to sọrọ lẹẹkansi.
He knew nothing about anything.	Ko mọ nkankan nipa ohunkohun.
Now you will know him by his own words.	Bayi iwọ yoo mọ ọ nipasẹ awọn ọrọ tirẹ.
Done.	Ti a ṣe.
I'm sure you enjoyed the trip.	O da mi loju pe o gbadun irin-ajo.
He lost his voice and could not express his teachings.	O padanu ohun rẹ ko si le sọ awọn ẹkọ rẹ.
A man that everyone loves.	Ọkunrin kan ti gbogbo eniyan fẹran.
Both games are fun.	Mejeeji ere ni o wa fun.
The brother who did the work.	Arakunrin ti o ṣe iṣẹ naa.
If you have time, contact me for dinner.	Ti o ba ni akoko, kan si mi fun ounjẹ alẹ.
Most people are very vulnerable.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni ipalara pupọ.
Two days left to go.	Ọjọ meji si ku lati lọ.
I talked to him again today.	Mo ti sọrọ fun u lẹẹkansi loni.
You agree that you love me too.	O gba pe o nifẹ mi pẹlu.
There is nothing to worry about.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
Two people we know work on this.	Awọn eniyan meji ti a mọ ṣiṣẹ lori eyi.
Obviously what they are trying to do.	O han gbangba ohun ti wọn n gbiyanju lati ṣe.
It doesn’t seem out of your way or anything.	Ko dabi pe o jade ni ọna rẹ tabi ohunkohun.
Do not tell anyone else what you see.	Maṣe sọ ohun ti o ri fun ẹnikẹni miiran.
But it seems hard to do.	Ṣugbọn o dabi ohun lile lati ṣe.
I know we have a lot going on.	Mo mọ pe a ni ọpọlọpọ nkan ti n lọ.
Here, they store wood for the winter.	Nibi, wọn tọju igi fun igba otutu.
They’ve got the best of the best.	Wọn ti ni ohun ti o dara julọ ti o dara julọ.
Who started the company.	Ẹniti o bẹrẹ ile-iṣẹ naa.
More than that.	Diẹ sii ju ti lọ.
No one tried to talk her out of it.	Ko si ọkan gbiyanju lati sọrọ rẹ jade ti o.
He met a tall woman.	O ba obinrin giga kan pade.
And in the morning, they left.	Ati ni owurọ, wọn lọ kuro.
It completely exhausted me.	O rẹ mi patapata.
I went to school.	Mo lọ ile-iwe.
Your diet helps your mood.	Ounjẹ rẹ ṣe iranlọwọ ipo rẹ.
Through good times, and bad.	Nipasẹ awọn akoko ti o dara, ati buburu.
I have no other opportunity for you.	Mi o ni anfani miiran fun o.
If you continue working because you love your work.	Ti o ba tẹsiwaju ṣiṣẹ nitori pe o nifẹ iṣẹ rẹ.
This is not a gift.	Eyi kii ṣe ẹbun.
I do not know how to operate the machine.	Emi ko mọ bi a ṣe le ṣiṣẹ ẹrọ naa.
But first.	Sugbon akọkọ.
She is a caring doctor for her son.	O jẹ dokita kan ti o ni aniyan fun ọmọ rẹ.
My sweetheart.	Ayanfẹ mi.
When that didn’t work, they arrested him.	Nigbati iyẹn ko ṣiṣẹ, wọn mu u lọwọ.
I carried him to his room.	Mo gbe e lọ si yara rẹ.
Your old body.	Ara rẹ atijọ.
Open the door and let us go.	Ṣii ilẹkun jẹ ki a lọ.
Nothing much has changed.	Ko si ohun Elo ti yi pada.
But after many years, he returned to his work.	Ṣugbọn lẹhin ọpọlọpọ ọdun, o pada si iṣẹ rẹ.
Because whether you know the story or not.	Nitori boya o mọ itan naa tabi ko mọ.
Our advice to you is simple.	Imọran wa si ọ rọrun.
He always called.	O pe nigbagbogbo.
Maybe he’s trying to say more than you can.	Boya o n gbiyanju lati sọ diẹ sii ju ti o lọ.

But the man seemed unconcerned.	Ṣugbọn ọkunrin naa dabi ẹni pe ko ni aniyan.
But, we still have ways to go.	Ṣugbọn, a tun ni awọn ọna lati lọ.
We take that seriously.	A gba iyẹn ni pataki.
And who could it be, he said.	Ati tani o le jẹ, o sọ.
But nothing could be heard from inside.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti a le gbọ lati inu.
And he did not try to get me into his picture.	Ati pe ko gbiyanju lati ṣe mi sinu aworan rẹ.
They had been walking for several hours.	Wọn ti rin fun wakati pupọ.
It will happen, it will happen, it will happen.	Yoo ṣẹlẹ, yoo ṣẹlẹ, yoo ṣẹlẹ.
That is a lot.	Iyẹn jẹ pupọ.
They will not be attending the ceremony.	Wọn kii yoo wa si ayẹyẹ naa.
Nothing to do for now.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣe fun bayi.
I have to tell you this story.	Mo ni lati sọ itan yii fun ọ.
For a very simple reason.	Fun idi kan ti o rọrun pupọ.
I do not know.	Emi ko mọ.
Not today.	Kii ṣe loni.
Not down.	Ko ṣe si isalẹ.
Or it does not matter.	Tabi ko ṣe pataki.
We started to see what was happening.	A bẹrẹ lati wo ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
We pay a high price for this.	A san owo giga fun eyi.
You have that opportunity.	O ni anfani yẹn.
So we need to show them a good time.	Nitorina a nilo lati fi akoko ti o dara han wọn.
I learned more, but not much.	Mo kọ ẹkọ diẹ sii, ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ.
Do what will mean the most to you.	Ṣe ohun ti yoo tumọ si julọ fun ọ.
You will be greatly missed.	O yoo wa ni gidigidi padanu.
We love each other.	A feran ara wa.
Things are good for everyone when you are here.	Awọn nkan dara fun gbogbo eniyan nigbati o wa nibi.
They play football all year.	Wọn ṣe bọọlu ni gbogbo ọdun.
He will not accept me.	Ko ni gba mi.
The only thing I can give someone is myself now.	Nikan ohun ti mo le fun ẹnikan ni ara mi ni bayi.
He was living with his mother at that time.	O n gbe pẹlu iya rẹ ni akoko yẹn.
Nothing makes sense.	Ko si ohun ti o ni oye.
The woman is not here.	Obinrin naa ko wa ni ibi yii.
There you are!	Nibẹ ni o wa!
But hours passed and no one came.	Ṣugbọn awọn wakati kọja ko si si ẹnikan ti o wa.
Everyone is talking about it.	Gbogbo eniyan n sọrọ nipa rẹ.
Good year.	Odun to dara.
I hope you love it all.	Mo nireti pe o nifẹ gbogbo rẹ.
In a good way.	Ni ọna ti o dara.
Everything you say is fun in time.	Gbogbo ohun ti o sọ ni fun ni akoko.
You can do it.	O le ṣe.
So you must not forget this.	Nitorina o ko gbọdọ gbagbe eyi.
They will not hear the benefits.	Wọn kii yoo gbọ awọn anfani.
He was picked up by a car.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan ni o sare gbe e lọ.
Try saying that to a group of your friends.	Gbiyanju lati sọ iyẹn si ẹgbẹ awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
I am worried about their future.	Mo ni aniyan nipa ojo iwaju wọn.
Not the best thing.	Kii ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
I have other problems.	Mo ni awọn iṣoro miiran.
Everything here was and is.	Ohun gbogbo nibi wà ati ki o jẹ.
We will help in any way we can.	A yoo ṣe iranlọwọ ni eyikeyi ọna ti a le.
Sitting next to me.	Joko ti mi.
They feel the same way.	Wọn lero ni ọna kanna.
I thought about it.	Mo ti ronu nipa rẹ.
I think it should be you.	Mo ro pe o yẹ ki o jẹ iwọ.
Zero from it.	Odo lati rẹ.
You need to hear from him.	O nilo lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
My back came home.	Ẹhin mi wa si ile.
You have made your decision.	O ti ṣe ipinnu ipinnu rẹ.
The group agreed to a deal.	Ẹgbẹ naa gba adehun kan.
They’re out at this point.	Wọn ti jade ni aaye yii.
Sometimes you have to test it.	Nigba miiran o ni lati ṣe idanwo rẹ.
Only in the room.	Nikan ninu yara.
We have to come back.	A ni lati pada.
Nothing of interest, really.	Ko si ohun ti awọn anfani, gan.
You forgot the three bills you had to remember.	O gbagbe awọn owo mẹta ti o ni lati ranti.
You know them by name.	O mọ wọn nipa orukọ.
Definitely not going.	O daju pe ko lọ.
But not for a while.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe fun igba diẹ.
I'll know how.	Emi yoo mọ bi.
This was great.	Eleyi je nla.
I have not heard anything from him.	Emi ko tii gbọ ohunkohun lati ọdọ rẹ.
Not before they were such a system.	Ko ṣaaju ki wọn jẹ iru eto bẹẹ.
But that is not for them to decide.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe fun wọn lati pinnu.
He made many friends at the party.	O ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ ni ibi ayẹyẹ naa.
I wrote something to him a while ago.	Mo kọ nkan kan si i ni igba diẹ sẹhin.
But there was a range of ideas.	Ṣugbọn nibẹ wà kan ibiti o ti ero.
I hope it continues all day.	Mo nireti pe o tẹsiwaju ni gbogbo ọjọ.
They will not know anything for a while.	Wọn kii yoo mọ ohunkohun fun igba diẹ.
Your work schedule is very full.	Eto iṣẹ rẹ ti kun pupọ.
This is a serious problem.	Eyi jẹ iṣoro pataki kan.
You can see.	O le rii.
It does not happen.	Ko maa ṣẹlẹ.
I just did not see it.	Mo ti o kan ko ri o.
This continued for a very long time.	Eyi tẹsiwaju fun igba pipẹ pupọ.
Some good, some not.	Diẹ ninu awọn dara, diẹ ninu awọn ko.
A lot of work.	Iṣẹ pupọ pupọ.
Take a good look around and enjoy your time here.	Ṣe oju ti o dara ni ayika ati gbadun akoko rẹ nibi.
And you are.	Ati pe iwọ ni.
It will be very good.	Yoo dara pupọ.
Another great thing to do.	Ohun nla miiran lati ṣe.
Another thing to consider is this.	Ohun miiran ti o yẹ ki o ronu ni eyi.
The best thing is to get started.	Ohun ti o dara julọ ni lati bẹrẹ.
Women do.	Awọn obinrin ṣe.
Here we give only one of them.	Nibi ti a fun nikan ni ọkan ninu wọn.
You don't like music.	O ko fẹ orin.
No one wants to stay here.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹ duro nibi.
I think your child will think that out over time.	Mo ro pe ọmọ rẹ yoo ro pe jade lori akoko.
We have to go!	A ni lati lọ!
Now go home.	Bayi lọ si ile.
For us, it just has to be a good road.	Fun wa, o kan lati wa ni opopona dara.
You want to read in the books.	O fẹ ka ninu awọn iwe.
They must move.	Wọn gbọdọ gbe.
Rise to rest.	Dide isinmi.
Only those who slept on the mountain were awakened.	Nikan awọn ti o sun lori oke oke ni wọn ji.
Be physically active.	Wa lọwọ nipa ti ara.
My husband is out.	Ọkọ mi ba jade.
We are doing the best we can.	A n ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ ti a le.
More in a minute.	Diẹ sii ni iṣẹju kan.
It needs nothing.	Ko nilo kankan.
I do not accept this.	Emi ko gba eyi.
We don’t see what we should see.	A ko rii ohun ti o yẹ ki a rii.
They take care of their families.	Wọn tọju awọn idile wọn.
If not, try the following.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, gbiyanju awọn wọnyi.
Class is important.	Kilasi ṣe pataki.
Lots of worthy men.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkunrin ti o yẹ.
Some have trouble getting up in bed.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni wahala lati dide lori ibusun.
That is for the child himself.	Iyẹn jẹ fun ọmọ naa funrararẹ.
Maybe that's all it was.	Boya ti o ni gbogbo awọn ti o wà.
We need a new way.	A nilo ọna tuntun.
Nothing special about it.	Ko si ohun pataki nipa rẹ.
There are better to be.	Nibẹ ni o wa dara lati wa ni.
That's not good.	Iyẹn ko dara.
It does not seem to appear today.	Ko dabi ẹni pe o han loni.
So he was a good boy.	Nitorina o jẹ ọmọkunrin ti o dara.
I heard more.	Mo gbọ diẹ sii.
Two of them said no.	Meji ninu wọn sọ pe wọn ko.
I really think so.	Mo ro gan lo.
There is nothing wrong with me.	Ko si ohun ti ko tọ si pẹlu mi.
Family or friends can help in this situation.	Ebi tabi awọn ọrẹ le ṣe iranlọwọ ni ipo yii.
He is with her.	O wa pẹlu rẹ.
I think you love it a little.	Mo ro pe o nifẹ rẹ diẹ.
I do not know who these people are.	Emi ko mọ ti awọn eniyan wọnyi jẹ.
Now your book is complete.	Bayi iwe rẹ ti pari.
Everything you expected to happen did not happen.	Ohun gbogbo ti o ti reti lati ṣẹlẹ ko ni.
My father was there.	Baba mi wa nibẹ.
They stopped everywhere they went.	Wọn ti duro ni gbogbo ibi ti wọn lọ.
Now, you can have a seat.	Bayi, o le ni ijoko.
Most are young or a little older than children.	Pupọ jẹ ọmọde tabi diẹ diẹ sii ju awọn ọmọde lọ.
There are two big cities nearby.	Ilu nla meji wa nitosi.
I was trying to think of myself out of it.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ronu ara mi kuro ninu rẹ.
He shook his head at her.	O mi ori ni ara rẹ.
For him, law is law.	Fun u, ofin ni ofin.
Now it is very easy to do.	Bayi o rọrun pupọ lati ṣe.
His house is on one of its many.	Ile rẹ wa lori ọkan ninu ọpọlọpọ rẹ.
That was not the first thing he told her.	Kii ṣe ohun akọkọ ti o sọ fun u niyẹn.
He knew his family.	O mọ ebi rẹ.
This is the main problem.	Eyi ni iṣoro akọkọ.
It happened during my school years.	O ṣẹlẹ ni awọn ọdun ile-iwe mi.
I'm stuck out.	Mo ti di jade.
It could be your child.	O le jẹ ọmọ rẹ.
We have our bad days but.	A ni awọn ọjọ buburu wa ṣugbọn.
Draw your hand on my body.	Aworan ọwọ rẹ lori ara mi.
It opened two doors for me in my career.	O ṣii awọn ilẹkun meji fun mi ninu iṣẹ mi.
I want to be loved.	Mo fẹ lati wa ni ife.
He expected from me to start things going.	O nireti lati ọdọ mi lati bẹrẹ awọn nkan lọ.
But there was no reason to leave me there.	Ṣugbọn ko si idi lati fi mi silẹ nibẹ.
There is nothing beautiful about it.	Ko si ohun ti lẹwa nipa o.
But that is not appropriate.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko yẹ.
They are not now.	Wọn kii ṣe bayi.
I need to run more.	Mo nilo lati ṣiṣe diẹ sii.
Whatever they are.	Ohunkohun ti won ba wa ni.
My brother went to work overseas.	Arakunrin mi lọ ṣiṣẹ ni oke okun.
He stopped, obviously wanting something else.	O duro, o han gbangba pe o fẹ nkan miiran.
So he waited for a few more minutes, thinking about the situation.	Nitorina o duro fun iṣẹju diẹ diẹ sii, ni ero nipa ipo naa.
That is another thing.	Ohun miiran niyen.
It is well specifically in this house.	O jẹ daradara ni pataki ni ile yii.
I'm glad to hear this.	Inu mi dun lati gbọ eyi.
The body is long.	Ara ti o gun gun ni.
And it was broken.	Ati awọn ti o ti fọ.
He is already dead, even if his heart beats again.	O ti ku tẹlẹ, paapaa ti ọkan rẹ ba tun lu.
He dropped.	O ju silẹ.
But it will have to be something very sensible.	Ṣugbọn yoo ni lati jẹ nkan ti o ni oye gaan.
No education going on.	Ko si ẹkọ ti n lọ.
We can test now.	A le ṣe idanwo ni bayi.
He says there are times when he loves to get out.	O sọ pe awọn akoko wa nigbati o nifẹ lati jade.
However, this is not enough.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi ko to.
The road also comes to a nearby town.	Opopona tun wa si ilu to wa nitosi.
You’re doing that for a reason.	O n ṣe nkan yẹn fun idi kan.
Obviously this does not work.	O han ni eyi ko ṣiṣẹ.
Nothing less will do.	Ko si ohun ti o kere yoo ṣe.
Let your father decide!	Jẹ ki baba rẹ pinnu!
It pulled over my head.	O ti fa lori mi ori.
Her hair is growing up.	Irun rẹ ti n di soke.
He decided it couldn’t be his car he saw.	O pinnu pe ko le jẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ ti o rii.
He told me what he was looking for.	O sọ ohun ti o n wa fun mi.
That's not good.	Iyẹn ko dara.
As soon as he was seen on the hill he stopped.	Ni kete ti o ti rii lori oke o duro.
We do not.	A ko ṣe.
For many of us, this sea is our life.	Fun ọpọlọpọ wa, okun yii jẹ igbesi aye wa.
If they do even.	Ti wọn ba ṣe paapaa.
This should be a news story.	Eyi yẹ ki o jẹ itan iroyin kan.
I can’t just touch me.	Emi ko le jẹ ki o kan mi.
In his eyes.	Ni oju rẹ.
That’s definitely how it looks.	Iyẹn dajudaju bii o ṣe n wo.
I need to stay on the road.	Mo nilo lati duro lori ọna.
Some of these things came true.	Diẹ ninu awọn nkan wọnyi di otitọ.
So let it go.	Nitorina jẹ ki o lọ.
Our day out was over.	Wa ọjọ jade wà lori.
You’re putting your money first.	O n fi owo rẹ si akọkọ.
Accept or leave as you wish.	Gba tabi fi silẹ bi o ṣe fẹ.
How hard you work at this time is completely up to you.	Bawo ni lile ti o ṣiṣẹ ni akoko yii jẹ patapata si ọ.
And it shouldn’t.	Ati pe ko yẹ.
We will repeat their mistake.	A yoo tun ṣe aṣiṣe wọn.
He wanted to kill.	O fe lati pa.
He’s trying to improve.	O n gbiyanju lati dara si.
I know how that works.	Mo mọ bi iyẹn ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
I hope you have a wonderful day.	Mo nireti pe o ni ọjọ iyanu kan.
This road ends at a river.	Ọna yii pari ni odo kan.
There is nothing on it.	Ko si nkankan lori rẹ.
They can not wash.	Wọn ko le wẹ.
Think of their beautiful garden.	Ronu ti ọgba wọn lẹwa.
Maybe inside the city hall.	Boya inu ile ilu naa.
You can only look.	O le wo nikan.
She stays in bed for two weeks.	O duro ni ibusun ọsẹ meji.
People want to go their own way.	Awọn eniyan fẹ lati lọ si ọna ti ara wọn.
They can also be given away.	Wọn tun le fun ni kuro.
He told me he hated that.	O sọ fun mi pe o korira iyẹn.
What makes it so special is the system.	Ohun ti o jẹ ki o ṣe pataki julọ ni eto naa.
So the process becomes more complicated.	Nitorina ọna naa di iṣoro diẹ sii.
You can read about it here.	O le ka nipa rẹ nibi.
That is where the problem started.	Iyẹn ni ibi ti iṣoro naa ti bẹrẹ.
You can also talk.	O tun le sọrọ.
But at cost.	Sugbon ni iye owo.
That is not a complete legal explanation.	Iyẹn kii ṣe alaye ti ofin to pe.
Students sit through long days of lessons.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe joko nipasẹ ọjọ pipẹ ti awọn ẹkọ.
They can't connect you anymore.	Wọn ko le so o mọ.
High personal.	O ga ti ara ẹni.
The men who took him please go.	Awọn ọkunrin ti o mu u jọwọ lọ.
I do not agree.	Emi ko gba.
I want to show it again.	Mo fẹ lati fi han lẹẹkansi.
We can come up with what works best for me.	A le soke pẹlu ohun ti ṣiṣẹ ti o dara ju fun mi.
The game is very beautiful.	Awọn ere jẹ gidigidi lẹwa.
However, he was wrong.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ṣe aṣiṣe.
I sat in that office with him.	Mo joko ninu ọfiisi yẹn pẹlu rẹ.
She looked at her father.	O wo baba rẹ.
I refused, before he hit me.	Mo kọ, ṣaaju ki o to lu mi.
But maybe you want to make it easier.	Ṣugbọn boya o fẹ lati jẹ ki o rọrun.
Before you go, you have to switch to your job.	Ṣaaju ki o to lọ, o ni lati yipada si iṣẹ rẹ.
I'm very sorry.	Ma binu gidigidi.
He lives in the city.	O ngbe ni ilu.
Maybe it's too fast.	Boya o ti yara ju.
Three boys at work.	Awọn ọmọkunrin mẹta ni iṣẹ.
I will say it again, only.	Emi yoo sọ lẹẹkansi, nikan.
Let me go!	Jẹ ki mi lọ!
I can do that, he said.	Mo le ṣe iyẹn, o sọ.
Opportunities need to rise not cut.	Awọn anfani nilo lati dide ko ge.
I get it back.	Mo gba pada.
He was a man of choice.	O jẹ eniyan ti o fẹ.
People will be coming soon, some people, will call them.	Eniyan yoo wa laipẹ, awọn eniyan kan, yoo pe wọn.
It is only bad at one time.	O ti wa ni buburu nikan ni akoko kan.
Biological information is available for this.	Alaye ti ibi wa fun eyi.
This is what they do.	Eyi ni wọn ṣe.
She wants marriage.	O fẹ igbeyawo.
I do not know what to do.	Emi ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
And a little.	Ati kekere kan.
But it worked well enough for my purposes.	Ṣugbọn o ṣiṣẹ daradara to fun awọn idi mi.
Soon, he entered the room.	Laipẹ, o wọ inu yara naa.
If you know of anyone, let me know.	Ti o ba mọ ti ẹnikẹni, jẹ ki mi mọ.
It was a completely new concept for me that year.	O jẹ imọran tuntun patapata fun mi ni ọdun yẹn.
Well, we did not go to great lengths to store it.	O dara, a ko lọ si wahala pupọ lati tọju rẹ.
Please do not be afraid.	Jọwọ maṣe bẹru.
They have more time.	Wọn ni akoko diẹ sii.
Maybe it was an accident.	Boya o jẹ ijamba.
The weather here is always nice.	Oju ojo nibi nigbagbogbo dara.
You must add something to what you see.	O gbọdọ fi ohun kan kun si ohun ti o ri.
We can see here with them.	A le rii nibi pẹlu wọn.
All money has been transferred.	Gbogbo owo ti a ti gbe.
He got out of the car.	O jade kuro ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
I accept my contract.	Mo gba adehun mi.
I was just going to carry everything on.	Mo kan lilọ lati gbe ohun gbogbo lori.
It speaks the truth to power.	O sọ otitọ si agbara.
Go we will.	Lọ a yoo.
He was young.	O jẹ ọmọde.
Nothing great comes out.	Ko si ohun nla ti o ba jade.
Of course it is.	Dajudaju o jẹ.
The fire was extinguished for several hours.	A ti pari ina fun awọn wakati pupọ.
All days are well spent.	Gbogbo awọn ọjọ ti dara.
No, no, no.	Rara, rara, rara.
It is easy to use.	O rọrun lati lo.
I love the dress.	Mo nifẹ aṣọ naa.
He started his question when he left home.	O bẹrẹ ibeere rẹ nigbati o lọ kuro ni ile.
Find as many as you can, and let them know.	Wa ọpọlọpọ bi o ṣe le, ki o jẹ ki wọn mọ.
But nothing changed.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o yipada.
But you know better than to ask.	Ṣugbọn o mọ dara ju lati beere.
I say, not at all.	Mo sọ, kii ṣe rara.
That will change our entire approach.	Iyẹn yoo yi gbogbo ọna wa pada.
We already know that.	A ti mọ iyẹn.
This is very important.	Eyi jẹ pataki pupọ.
For me, that was it.	Fun mi, iyẹn ni.
It's been a long time coming.	O ni lati igba ti ojo ti n ro pupo.
I will not do it until later.	Emi kii yoo ṣe titi di pẹ.
There is a dog on the bed inside.	Aja kan wa lori ibusun inu.
But you have to.	Sugbon o ni lati.
At the same time, he heard from behind.	Ni akoko kanna, o gbọ lati lẹhin rẹ.
That's your business.	Ise re niyen.
If they do, they take their children to see.	Ti wọn ba ṣe, wọn mu awọn ọmọ wọn lọ lati wo.
I have to find out about them, especially.	Mo ni lati wa nipa wọn, paapaa.
The problem is that this does not work.	Iṣoro naa ni pe eyi ko ṣiṣẹ.
Some others want its conclusion.	Diẹ ninu awọn miiran fẹ ipari rẹ.
They can’t, or they can’t.	Wọn ko le, tabi wọn ko le ṣe.
It will be good for everyone.	Yoo dara julọ fun gbogbo eniyan.
That doesn’t help anything to get better.	Iyẹn ko ṣe iranlọwọ fun ohunkohun lati dara julọ.
I didn’t notice that at all.	Emi ko ṣe akiyesi iyẹn rara rara.
There is a great deal of energy today.	Agbara agbara nla kan wa loni.
Under his will.	Labẹ ifẹ rẹ.
He tilted his head to one side.	O gun ori rẹ si ẹgbẹ kan.
It's not really my thing.	Kii ṣe nkan mi gaan.
No, think it was a test.	Rara, ro pe o jẹ idanwo kan.
And he went into his bed.	O si wọ inu ibusun rẹ.
Okay, maybe he.	O dara, boya oun.
Every year, most people accept that this is the year.	Ni gbogbo ọdun, ọpọlọpọ eniyan gba pe eyi ni ọdun.
This includes lost value.	Eyi pẹlu iye ti o padanu.
Sorry to delay.	Ma binu lati pẹ.
You came out wrong.	O jade ni aṣiṣe.
It will become easier as time goes on.	Yoo di rọrun bi akoko ti n lọ.
We want to move many of them.	A fẹ lati gbe ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn.
Will just be for tonight.	Yoo kan jẹ fun alẹ oni.
He did it right.	O ṣe ni otitọ.
In the morning, it was all over again.	Ni owurọ, gbogbo rẹ tun wa.
That was a great summer for me.	Igba ooru nla niyẹn fun mi.
Thanks so much!!.	O se gan ni!!.
Not by accident.	Kii ṣe nipa ijamba.
I remember that night.	Mo ranti alẹ yẹn.
I do not deserve to see you at your desk.	Emi ko yẹ lati rii ni tabili rẹ.
He likes it very much.	O fẹran rẹ pupọ.
Age does not matter.	Ọjọ ori ko ṣe pataki.
He obviously did not think this through.	O han gbangba pe ko ronu eyi nipasẹ.
Someone like ourselves, maybe.	Ẹnikan bi ara wa, boya.
They helped me out of the truck.	Wọn ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi lati inu ọkọ nla naa.
Many have tried to change that.	Ọpọlọpọ ti gbiyanju lati yi iyẹn pada.
You know how to handle yourself.	O mọ bi o ṣe le mu ara rẹ mu.
I couldn’t seem to pull myself around.	Emi ko le dabi lati fa ara mi ni ayika.
Some things are missing from your attention.	Diẹ ninu awọn nkan bọ lọwọ akiyesi rẹ.
Few people are good at this.	Awọn eniyan diẹ ni o dara ni eyi.
You should take a break but do not.	O yẹ ki o gba isinmi ṣugbọn ko ṣe.
The work has been longer than you thought.	Iṣẹ naa ti pẹ ju bi o ti ro lọ.
Hate to carry anything.	Korira lati gbe ohunkohun.
You have to feel it is yours.	O ni lati lero pe o jẹ tirẹ.
Have a good time.	Ni akoko ti o dara.
We drink and eat until they are added.	A mu ati ki o jẹ titi ti won fi kun.
There, he did.	Nibẹ, o ti ṣe.
Here is their story.	Eyi ni itan wọn.
I did not get enough sleep for three days.	Emi ko ni oorun to dara fun ọjọ mẹta.
It is a story they can relate to.	O jẹ itan ti wọn le ṣe alaye si.
Again she told him how scared she was.	Lẹẹkansi o sọ fun u bi o ti bẹru rẹ.
In fact, he would do anything to stop it.	Ni otitọ, oun yoo ṣe ohunkohun lati da a duro.
We should talk.	A yẹ ki o sọrọ.
I have one.	Emi ni ọkan.
You would have told the police for him.	O yoo ti sọ fun ọlọpa fun u.
It does a few things, but not much.	O ṣe awọn nkan diẹ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ.
I walked by.	Mo rin nipa rẹ.
He will do it for him.	Oun yoo ṣe fun u.
They believe and will do whatever it takes.	Wọn gbagbọ ati pe yoo ṣe ohunkohun ti o gba.
Your teacher will tell you the rules.	Olukọ rẹ yoo sọ fun ọ ti awọn ofin.
Change only one item at a time.	Yi ohun kan nikan pada ni akoko kan.
It must change.	O gbọdọ yipada.
Don't ask me what that means, because we have no idea.	Maṣe beere lọwọ mi kini iyẹn tumọ si, nitori a ko ni imọran.
He reached out to her.	O de ọdọ rẹ.
The river has taken over this mountain.	Odo ti ya oke yi.
I have to help my dad.	Mo ni lati ran baba mi lọwọ.
Now it is not so.	Bayi ko ri bẹ.
It cannot change the world.	Ko le yi aye pada.
He did more than these things.	O ṣe diẹ sii ju nkan wọnyi lọ.
The car is there.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa wa nibẹ.
I have something.	Mo ni ohun kan.
It seems that people have a lot to be happy about.	O dabi pe eniyan ni ọpọlọpọ lati dun nipa.
We wash our hair, and we wash our hair.	A fọ irun wa, a si fọ irun wa.
No, not required.	Rara, ko nilo.
There is no charge for this.	Ko si owo fun eyi.
Also have to see how my dad looks.	Tun ni lati wo bi baba mi ṣe ri.
I looked up.	Mo wo e soke.
Play a game.	Ṣe ere kan.
But my husband is gone.	Ṣugbọn ọkọ mi ti lọ.
He is my dog.	Oun ni aja mi.
In fact, most people do not agree.	Ni otitọ, ọpọlọpọ eniyan ko gba.
He did not drink water for days at home.	O ko mu omi fun awọn ọjọ ni ile.
How people can insert.	Bawo ni eniyan ṣe le fi sii.
There must be a way.	Ọna kan gbọdọ wa.
She looked at the baby.	O wo ọmọ naa.
No, it is not possible.	Rara, ko ṣee ṣe.
One such idea has helped me a lot.	Ọkan iru ero ti ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi ni pataki.
That is very possible.	Iyẹn ṣee ṣe julọ.
She took most of her clothes.	O mu pupọ julọ awọn aṣọ rẹ.
The student parked his car on the road.	Ọmọ ile-iwe naa gbe ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ silẹ ni opopona.
No one can touch that.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o le fi ọwọ kan iyẹn.
Remember, start small and grow tall.	Ranti, bẹrẹ kekere ati ki o dagba ga.
I am not talking about this.	Emi ko sọrọ nipa eyi.
You know, not me.	O mọ, kii ṣe emi.
But that is not the first thing.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe ohun akọkọ.
You need a big table.	O nilo tabili nla kan.
He will not explain.	Oun ko ni ṣe alaye.
But he had a decision to make.	Ṣugbọn o ni ipinnu lati ṣe.
No, we have some good tests.	Rara, a ni diẹ ninu awọn idanwo to dara.
Plans are made.	Awọn eto ti ṣe.
Have a happy time.	Ni a dun akoko.
Some people believe, but most do not.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan gbagbọ, ṣugbọn pupọ julọ ko ṣe.
Maybe so and maybe not.	Boya bẹ ati boya kii ṣe.
Everything you can think about.	Ohun gbogbo ti o le ro nipa.
He told me about it.	O sọ fun mi nipa rẹ.
My wife is one.	Iyawo mi jẹ ọkan.
The world will never end.	Aye ko ni pari.
Is that even possible ?.	Ṣe iyẹn paapaa ṣee ṣe?.
It was the best music on his side.	O jẹ orin ti o dara julọ ni ẹgbẹ rẹ.
Now it will become hard.	Bayi o yoo di lile.
Things are as they are.	Awọn nkan jẹ bi wọn ṣe jẹ.
Money is here.	Owo wa nibi.
I don't know why, but that's what they call it.	Ko mọ idi, ṣugbọn ohun ti wọn pe niyẹn.
I have never found a book that is difficult to obtain.	Emi ko tii ri iwe kan ti o nira lati gba.
My mouth, so a mistake.	Ẹnu mi, nitorina aṣiṣe kan.
Hand it over to me now.	Fi i le mi lọwọ bayi.
Few cars parked on the roads.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ diẹ ti o gbe lori awọn opopona.
Her brothers are in school.	Awọn arakunrin rẹ wa ni ile-iwe.
You don't need one.	Ko nilo ọkan.
Don’t let yourself get behind.	Maṣe jẹ ki ara rẹ gba lẹhin.
School is open every day.	Ile-iwe wa ni igba ni gbogbo ọjọ.
You know where it will teach you, especially.	O mọ ibi ti yoo kọ ọ, paapaa.
I believe she can be a great wife and mother.	Mo gbagbọ pe o le jẹ iyawo ati iya nla.
He doesn’t want to think anything, not where these people are worried.	Ko fẹ lati ro ohunkohun, kii ṣe ibi ti awọn eniyan wọnyi ṣe aniyan.
You need both.	O nilo awọn mejeeji.
It means you need to know.	O tumọ si pe o nilo lati mọ.
Or so it seemed, at times.	Tabi ki o dabi enipe, ni igba.
Their opinion seems to be good.	Ero wọn dabi ẹni pe o dara.
They do not want to change.	Wọn ko fẹ lati yipada.
I love it and all.	Mo nifẹ rẹ ati gbogbo.
This is a good thing.	Eleyi jẹ ohun ti o dara.
I can't think of that.	Nko le ronu nkan naa jade.

Okay, for now that’s about it.	O dara, fun bayi iyẹn nipa rẹ.
And we think that might not be right.	Ati pe a ro pe iyẹn le ma tọ.
What a compelling reason.	Kini idi ti o yẹ.
Everyone is trying together, everyone is laughing together.	Gbogbo eniyan n gbiyanju papọ, gbogbo eniyan n rẹrin papọ.
I am fine.	Emi wa dara.
Our body is warm.	Ara wa gbona.
He who does not fear him.	Ẹniti ko bẹru rẹ.
If you decide to go out, it is best to start early.	Ti o ba pinnu lati jade, o dara julọ lati bẹrẹ ni kutukutu.
The sun has already set.	Oorun ti lọ silẹ tẹlẹ.
It has worked a long, long time ago.	O ti ṣiṣẹ ni pipẹ, igba pipẹ sẹhin.
There is something.	Nkankan wa.
You should not drink and drive.	O yẹ ki o ko mu ati ki o wakọ.
Now we have to go back to school.	Bayi a ni lati pada si ile-iwe.
You can turn the game on its head.	O le yi ere naa si ori.
But the game has gone on long enough.	Ṣugbọn awọn ere ti lọ lori gun to.
You will see again.	O yoo ri lẹẹkansi.
The sun is not needed at night.	Oju oorun ko nilo ni alẹ.
Not your way.	Kii ṣe ọna rẹ.
When he was little, he would not wear shoes.	Nigbati o wa ni kekere, ko ni wọ bata.
He did not leave the house.	Ko kuro ni ile.
You need a drink.	O nilo ohun mimu.
The city receives energy and water from a river.	Ilu naa n gba agbara ati omi lati odo kan.
This is however difficult.	Eyi sibẹsibẹ nira.
Which did not.	Eyi ti ko ṣe.
Someone who can come and go without question.	Ẹnikan ti o le wa ki o lọ laisi ibeere.
I did not stop.	Emi ko da.
However, it is done.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ti ṣe.
He did not, and could not have.	Ko ṣe bẹ, ko si le ni.
Housewives are known to be very active most of the time.	Awọn iyawo ile ni a mọ pe o n ṣiṣẹ lọwọ pupọ julọ igba.
Let me try this.	Jẹ ki n gbiyanju eyi.
However he could not let this pass.	Sibẹsibẹ ko le jẹ ki eyi kọja.
He did not stop.	Ko duro.
Stop playing games and go to work.	Da awọn ere ṣiṣẹ ki o lọ si iṣẹ.
We will stay here forever.	A yoo duro nibi lailai.
I don’t know what would be best for anyone.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti yoo dara julọ fun ẹnikẹni.
And one is even wrong.	Ati pe ọkan jẹ paapaa aṣiṣe paapaa.
These are worth something.	Awọn wọnyi ni o tọ nkankan.
Even my bed.	Paapaa ibusun mi.
You do not understand.	O ko loye.
So most of my friends don’t.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ mi ko ni.
I will not repeat my questions.	Emi kii yoo tun awọn ibeere mi ṣe.
I'm not happy about that.	Inu mi ko dun nipa iyẹn.
He promised me that he would call.	O ṣe ileri fun mi pe oun yoo pe.
He obviously likes it.	O han ni fẹran rẹ.
He knew he had to run.	O mọ pe o yẹ lati ṣiṣe.
But it will be too late.	Ṣugbọn yoo pẹ ju.
This is an important time in your life right now.	Eyi jẹ akoko pataki ninu igbesi aye rẹ ni bayi.
But you have it.	Sugbon o ni o.
I need life.	Mo nilo ni aye.
He is with me.	O wa pẹlu mi.
In a minute he heard it again.	Ni iṣẹju kan o tun gbọ lẹẹkansi.
It is what we want to do.	O jẹ ohun ti a fẹ lati ṣe.
Do those men have little girls like me, he asked.	Ṣe awọn ọkunrin yẹn ni awọn ọmọbirin kekere bi emi, o beere.
I am on the way to see it.	Mo wa lori ọna lati wo rẹ.
He decided to try a new application.	O pinnu lati gbiyanju ohun elo tuntun kan.
He has not worked since his injury.	Ko ti ṣiṣẹ lati igba ipalara rẹ.
And they are not used to saying what they cannot do.	Ati pe wọn ko lo lati sọ ohun ti wọn ko le ṣe.
But this is hard to believe.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ gidigidi lati gbagbọ.
Life does not happen the other way around.	Igbesi aye ko ṣẹlẹ ni ọna miiran.
You can not understand.	O ko le loye.
We can’t believe what we just did.	A ko le gbagbọ ohun ti a kan ṣe.
Will let us be in the industry.	Yoo jẹ ki a wa ni ile-iṣẹ.
He spoke a little.	O sọrọ ni kekere kan.
You’re asking the wrong question completely.	O n beere ibeere ti ko tọ patapata.
I was afraid to go out.	Mo bẹru lati jade.
Maybe something in me has just been enough.	Boya ohun kan ninu mi ti kan ti to.
I want to grow up.	Mo fe dagba.
Easy to remember.	Rọrun lati ranti.
Obviously, he was a person who hurt me the most.	O han ni, o jẹ eniyan kan ti o dun mi julọ.
But for those who don’t, now you know.	Ṣugbọn fun awọn ti o ko ni, ni bayi o mọ.
I am calling a car.	Mo n pe ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
They can’t like it.	Wọn ko le fẹran rẹ.
It makes you doubt yourself.	O mu ki o ṣiyemeji ara rẹ.
He can tell you the conditions.	O le sọ awọn ipo fun ọ.
Just the work.	O kan iṣẹ naa.
I asked a sister for her advice.	Mo beere fun arabinrin kan fun imọran rẹ.
He wanted to believe, but he was afraid to.	O fẹ gbagbọ, ṣugbọn o bẹru lati.
They will take your job.	Wọn yoo gba iṣẹ rẹ.
I'm glad to hear you're home.	Inu mi dun lati gbọ pe o wa ni ile.
We hope you enjoy it.	A nireti pe o ma wà.
They meet everyone.	Wọn ṣe ipade gbogbo eniyan.
This is your life, to grow in.	Eyi ni igbesi aye rẹ, lati dagba ninu.
And yet it is here.	Ati sibẹsibẹ o wa nibi.
I come back to that.	Mo tun pada wa si iyẹn.
Wear your best clothes when you go out today.	Wọ aṣọ rẹ ti o dara julọ nigbati o ba jade loni.
After the game, everyone went to the bar.	Lẹhin ere, gbogbo eniyan lọ si igi.
But, this does.	Ṣugbọn, eyi ṣe.
I'm happy for you.	Inu mi dun fun yin.
Remember that it takes time to build these areas.	Ranti pe o gba akoko lati kọ awọn agbegbe wọnyi.
But we changed.	Ṣugbọn a yipada.
At first, it was really good.	Ni akọkọ, o dara gaan.
A few more words from his mouth and we were done.	Awọn ọrọ diẹ diẹ sii lati ẹnu rẹ ati pe a ti pari.
Everything around him changed.	Ohun gbogbo ti o wa ni ayika rẹ yipada.
In one room people write letters.	Ninu yara kan awọn eniyan n kọ awọn lẹta.
I asked someone to help me cut them off.	Mo beere lọwọ ẹnikan lati ran mi lọwọ lati ge wọn kuro.
I think it could be.	Mo ro pe o le jẹ.
And what kind of hours can they work.	Ati iru awọn wakati wo ni wọn le ṣiṣẹ.
This will make life easier.	Eyi yoo jẹ ki igbesi aye rọrun.
This cannot happen.	Eyi ko le ṣẹlẹ.
You never know where you're going or who you're going to turn to.	O ko mọ ibiti o lọ tabi ẹniti yoo yipada si.
We start with ourselves.	A bẹrẹ pẹlu ara wa.
I know you know that these songs will be with us forever.	Mo mọ pe o mọ pe awọn orin wọnyi yoo wa pẹlu wa lailai.
In fact, it may not be completely possible.	Ni otitọ, o le ma ṣee ṣe patapata.
The house will sell outdoors.	Ile yoo ta ni ita gbangba.
Now that the money is gone.	Bayi wipe owo ti lọ.
I want to sort things out.	Mo fẹ lati to nkan jade.
He thought it was great but it was a little weird.	O ro pe o jẹ nla ṣugbọn o jẹ iyalẹnu diẹ.
I missed this.	Mo padanu eyi.
That is the law of the land.	Ofin ile yii niyen.
Both have tried.	Awọn mejeeji ti gbiyanju.
No hair.	Ko irun.
The important truth is not drinking.	Otitọ pataki kii ṣe mimu.
He has no interest.	Ko ni anfani.
He is the one who will help me.	Oun ni ẹni ti yoo ran mi lọwọ.
There are a few people on the bus right now.	Awọn eniyan diẹ wa lori ọkọ akero ni bayi.
And it is not for you to say.	Ati pe kii ṣe fun ọ lati sọ.
He would not have understood.	Oun ki ba ti loye.
It is important that everyone understands each other.	O ṣe pataki ki gbogbo eniyan loye ara wọn.
Everything you need.	Gbogbo ohun ti o nilo fun.
Thinking about what people say.	N ronu nipa ohun ti eniyan sọ.
There may be some information.	Alaye kan le wa.
There are so many important things going on.	Ọpọlọpọ nkan pataki wa ti n lọ.
That was why he wanted to be with her.	Ti o wà idi ti o fe di pẹlu rẹ.
I must return to the city.	Mo gbọdọ pada si ilu.
Of course you would not want to see it.	Dajudaju iwọ kii yoo fẹ lati ri i.
You find your way through trial and error.	O wa ọna rẹ nipasẹ idanwo ati aṣiṣe.
But we only have moments.	Ṣugbọn a ni awọn akoko nikan.
All of this is very amazing.	Gbogbo eyi jẹ iyanu pupọ.
It's hot.	O gbona.
I don’t know myself from him.	Ko mọ ara mi lati ọdọ rẹ.
But it will not help.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.
Give it to him and you’re done for it.	Fi fun u ati pe o ti pari fun.
Would love to see us.	Yoo fẹ lati ri wa.
Stand by.	Duro diẹ.
For about two years, one week.	Fun bii ọdun meji, ọsẹ kan.
I moved.	Mo ti gbe.
He let her go and came back.	O jẹ ki o lọ o si pada sẹhin.
This will never be forgotten.	Eyi ko ni gbagbe.
Don't let me go '.	Maṣe jẹ ki lọ '.
I am convinced.	Mo da mi loju.
Which you know for sure.	Eyi ti o mọ dajudaju.
This is your day.	Eyi jẹ ọjọ rẹ.
If water is on the clock, fine too.	Ti omi ba wa lori aago, dara julọ tun.
We were able to visit two schools.	A ni anfani lati ṣabẹwo si ile-iwe meji.
The restaurant is near their office building.	Ile ounjẹ naa wa nitosi ile ọfiisi wọn.
Here is how it works.	Eyi ni bi o ti ṣiṣẹ.
But there are no weeks or days, or even hours.	Ṣugbọn ko ni awọn ọsẹ tabi awọn ọjọ, tabi paapaa awọn wakati.
It was not a question if.	O je ko kan ibeere ti o ba ti.
Something we can’t get back in time.	Ohun kan ti a ko le gba pada ni akoko.
More is not possible.	Diẹ sii ko ṣee ṣe.
It looks beautiful.	O wo lẹwa.
I look now.	Mo wo bayi.
It should have been included soon.	O yẹ ki o ti wa pẹlu laipẹ.
On top of that, the city is a big city.	Lori oke, ilu naa jẹ ilu nla kan.
In this case it is correct.	Ninu eyi o tọ.
Or, at least, no one with that name will.	Tabi, o kere ju, ko si ẹnikan ti o ni orukọ yẹn yoo.
Any type will do but some may be better than others.	Eyikeyi iru yoo ṣe ṣugbọn diẹ ninu le dara ju awọn miiran lọ.
If you can, do your best to try them out a few times.	Ti o ba le, ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ lati gbiyanju wọn ni igba diẹ.
In their minds, what they are doing makes sense.	Ni ori wọn, ohun ti wọn n ṣe ni oye.
I just said it was possible.	Mo kan sọ pe o ṣee ṣe.
Where the plane is unknown.	Ibi ti ọkọ ofurufu naa ko mọ.
People hate me for you.	Eniyan korira mi fun o.
That is, he thought.	Iyẹn ni, o ro.
So they put them in place.	Nitorina wọn fi wọn sinu ibi.
We have done so well.	A ti ṣe bẹ daradara.
Too much money for no benefit.	Owo pupọ fun ko si anfani.
Do not look down.	Maṣe wo isalẹ.
Broken clothes	Awọn aṣọ ti a fọ
No one listened to him.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o gbọ tirẹ.
Leave space for.	Fi aaye silẹ fun.
The whole body.	Gbogbo ara.
Very beautiful and not very functional.	Lẹwa pupọ ati pe ko ṣiṣẹ pupọ.
It took some time to climb that steep hill.	O gba akoko diẹ lati gun oke giga yẹn.
He has no other family.	Ko ni idile miiran.
He let me go to the beach.	O jẹ ki mi lọ si okun.
It takes a lot more time than I do.	O n gba akoko pupọ ju mi ​​lọ.
There is no room left '.	Ko si aaye kuro'.
If you know what it is.	Ti o ba jẹ pe o mọ kini o jẹ.
This is important for two reasons.	Eyi jẹ pataki fun idi meji.
The story is completely dead.	Itan naa ti ku patapata.
So when we grow up, everyone has a chance.	Nitorina nigba ti a ba dagba, gbogbo eniyan ni anfani.
You can even be with me.	O le paapaa wa pẹlu mi.
If you call someone, they will call you.	Ti o ba pe ẹnikan, yoo ti pe ọ.
I'm glad to see you.	Inu mi dun lati ri e.
These people are hungry.	Ebi ni awọn eniyan wọnyi.
This is your legal status.	Eyi ni ipo ofin rẹ.
It was beautiful to have friends.	O jẹ ohun lẹwa lati ni awọn ọrẹ.
He just wanted to be two of them.	O fe ki o kan jẹ awọn meji ninu wọn.
Please learn from my mistakes.	Jọwọ kọ ẹkọ lati awọn aṣiṣe mi.
He asked for this.	O beere fun eyi.
Not here.	Ko si nibi.
Get into your car.	Wọ sinu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ.
Sure.	O daju pe.
And go out driving.	Ki o si jade lọ awakọ.
Both require observation skills.	Awọn mejeeji nilo awọn ọgbọn akiyesi.
Young, but not beautiful.	Ọmọde, ṣugbọn kii ṣe lẹwa.
The most important of these are the two groups of three.	Pataki julọ ninu awọn wọnyi wa ni awọn ẹgbẹ meji ti mẹta.
We have no idea what that means.	A ko ni imọran ohun ti o tumọ si.
But before you know it, a week has passed.	Ṣugbọn ṣaaju ki o to mọ, ọsẹ kan ti kọja.
I have never seen them leave their phones.	Emi ko tii ri wọn ti wọn fi foonu wọn silẹ.
Too few people have time to read anymore.	Pupọ eniyan diẹ ni akoko lati ka mọ.
Do not give them, or them, any power in that situation.	Maṣe fun wọn, tabi wọn, eyikeyi agbara ni ipo naa.
They are in a position to do that.	Wọn wa ni ipo ti wọn le ṣe iyẹn.
And that is not possible.	Ati pe iyẹn ko ṣeeṣe.
She is very scared.	O bẹru gaan.
I mean, you really know what you're doing.	Mo tumọ si, o mọ ohun ti o n ṣe gaan.
His team played poorly.	Ẹgbẹ rẹ dun ko dara.
He did not give us any money.	Ko si fun wa ni owo kankan.
And yet, it also happened to me.	Ati sibẹsibẹ, o tun ṣẹlẹ si mi.
You can live in my house.	O le gbe ni ile mi.
We did well today.	A ṣe o dara loni.
Just feel.	Kan lero.
He cannot use his power.	Ko le lo agbara rẹ.
So we are looking for a name.	Nitorina a n wa orukọ.
I am sure we will.	Mo ni idaniloju pe a yoo.
Many high school students find it difficult to find work.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe giga ni o nira lati wa iṣẹ.
I started about a few years ago.	Mo bẹrẹ bii ọdun diẹ sẹhin.
It hit me about three years ago.	O lu mi ni bii ọdun mẹta sẹhin.
You can read more about that here.	O le ka diẹ sii nipa iyẹn nibi.
A drink is a drink.	Ohun mimu jẹ ohun mimu.
Tell them they are on their own.	Sọ fun wọn pe wọn wa lori ara wọn.
Like this morning.	Bi owurọ yi.
Everyone knows who you mean.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ ẹniti o tumọ si.
That's good news.	O dara iroyin to dara niyẹn.
I do not even know where I started.	Emi ko paapaa mọ ibiti mo ti bẹrẹ.
He knew nothing about it.	Ko mọ nkankan nipa rẹ.
Without water, life is impossible.	Laisi omi, aye ko ṣee ṣe.
That is to be expected.	Iyẹn ni lati nireti.
Words may not be used.	Awọn ọrọ le ma ṣee lo.
Sleep on it.	Sun lori rẹ.
There are very few.	Nibẹ ni o wa gidigidi diẹ ninu awọn.
I tried to change them but they didn’t give.	Mo gbiyanju lati yi wọn pada ṣugbọn wọn ko fun.
But that's good enough.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn dara to.
No body ever seen.	Ko si ara lailai ri.
That makes me laugh now.	Eyi mu mi rẹrin ni bayi.
And to ask for advice is not my way at all.	Ati lati beere imọran kii ṣe ọna mi rara.
I'm glad to be here.	Inu mi dun lati wa nibi.
History must be in it.	Itan gbọdọ wa ninu rẹ.
Read here.	Ka nibi.
This is thinking out of the box.	Eyi n ronu jade kuro ninu apoti.
He called us for a boat ride from here.	O pe wa fun ọkọ oju omi lati ibi.
What is your biggest concern?	Kini o ṣe aniyan julọ julọ?
It all went well until morning.	Gbogbo rẹ lọ daradara titi di owurọ.
Okay, it doesn't matter.	O dara, ko ṣe pataki.
He hopes to work hard at it.	O nireti lati ṣe iṣẹ ni ṣiṣe.
We decided to sleep on it.	A pinnu lati sun lori rẹ.
I can’t think of a better way to end the day.	Emi ko le ronu ọna ti o dara julọ lati pari ọjọ naa.
He doesn’t like being stuck up to.	Ko fẹran a duro soke si.
Of course he will pass.	Dajudaju oun yoo kọja.
He will never make the same mistake again.	Oun kii yoo tun ṣe aṣiṣe kanna.
You have every one of these.	O ni gbogbo ọkan ninu awọn wọnyi.
You look at others.	O wo awọn miiran.
They don’t want to know, they don’t want to hear the word.	Wọn ko fẹ lati mọ, wọn ko fẹ gbọ ọrọ naa.
And tell your friends to do the same.	Ati sọ fun awọn ọrẹ rẹ lati ṣe kanna.
I think you feel the same way.	Mo ro pe o lero ni ọna kanna.
I have never killed anyone.	Nko tii pa enikeni ri.
But the cost is high.	Ṣugbọn iye owo naa ga.
As soon as they got inside, he locked the door.	Ni kete ti wọn wa inu, o ti ilẹkun.
But not so here.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ nibi.
He rode in the back seat.	O gun ni ẹhin ijoko.
He also changed his name.	O tun yi orukọ rẹ pada.
Again, they may have done so.	Lẹẹkansi, wọn le ti ṣe bẹ.
You can’t believe this is happening.	O ko le gbagbọ pe eyi n ṣẹlẹ.
Never before has anyone read bedtime stories to him.	Ko tii ki ẹnikẹni ka itan akoko ibusun fun u.
Or it doesn’t take up much space.	Tabi ko gba aaye pupọ.
Friends take the time to call you up.	Awọn ọrẹ gba akoko lati pe ọ soke.
And maybe we are.	Ati boya a jẹ.
I take your advice.	Mo gba imọran rẹ.
The men left in minutes.	Awọn ọkunrin ti lọ ni iṣẹju.
A story that has been read time and time again.	Itan kan ti a ti ka akoko ati akoko lẹẹkansi.
The sister was very happy.	Arabinrin naa dun pupọ.
Help me to save that time.	Ran mi lọwọ lati gba akoko naa.
You should do something about that.	O yẹ ki o ṣe nkan nipa iyẹn.
It was a good day for him.	O jẹ ọjọ ti o dara fun u.
Not at this point.	Kii ṣe ni aaye yii.
We have your back.	A ni ẹhin rẹ.
He looked at me.	O wo mi.
Not that you thought it would be.	Kii ṣe pe o ro pe yoo jẹ.
Okay, some more than others.	O dara, diẹ ninu diẹ sii ju awọn miiran lọ.
What we were meant to be.	Ohun ti a ti pinnu lati wa ni.
So it will end this year.	Nitorina o yoo pari ni ọdun yii.
Okay, we stopped off the roads.	O dara, a duro kuro ni awọn ọna.
I want more things to do that for him.	Mo fẹ awọn nkan diẹ sii ti o ṣe iyẹn fun u.
This did not take time away from my family.	Eyi ko gba akoko kuro ni idile mi.
If they do, great.	Ti wọn ba ṣe, nla.
This is the way it always works.	Eyi ni ọna ti o ṣiṣẹ nigbagbogbo.
You know what’s out there.	O mọ ohun ti o wa nibẹ.
I am everywhere.	Mo ti wa nibi gbogbo.
I don’t think it’s easy.	Emi ko ro pe o rọrun.
It made my life so much easier.	O jẹ ki igbesi aye mi rọrun pupọ.
And every reason to do so.	Ati gbogbo idi lati ṣe bẹ.
You know that.	O mọ iyẹn.
He is on his way now.	O wa ni ọna rẹ bayi.
But that does not end the story.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko pari itan naa.
Now you get to deal with it, the same as I do.	Bayi o gba lati wo pẹlu rẹ, kanna bi emi.
That kept him going.	Iyẹn pa a mọ.
That's too high.	Iyẹn ga pupọ.
But let’s think about that.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki a ronu nipa eyi.
Image as information.	Aworan bi alaye.
I was there when he died.	Mo wa nibẹ nigbati o ku.
But you also have to be the best.	Ṣugbọn o tun ni lati jẹ ẹni ti o dara julọ.
Something more bad could be at work.	Nkankan diẹ sii ko dara le wa ni iṣẹ.
No, make games.	Rara, ṣe awọn ere.
Some games require two players.	Diẹ ninu awọn ere nilo awọn ẹrọ orin meji.
And more to come.	Ati pe diẹ sii wa si.
They said they would stop him.	Wọn sọ pe wọn yoo da duro si i.
The world should know what happened.	Aye yẹ ki o mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
If this is your interest, you will not find anything here.	Ti eyi ba jẹ anfani rẹ, iwọ kii yoo ri nkankan nibi.
Wish for many reasons you can get them down there.	Ṣe fẹ fun ọpọlọpọ awọn idi ti o le gba wọn si isalẹ wa nibẹ.
He was the first man of its kind to meet.	Oun ni ọkunrin akọkọ ti iru rẹ ti o ti pade.
Two hours can feel like a minute.	Wakati meji le lero bi iṣẹju kan.
But we do not have them.	Sugbon a ko ni wọn.
We are all on the same boat.	Gbogbo wa wa lori ọkọ oju omi kanna.
But not your eyes.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe oju rẹ.
Can't wait to take the time to read.	Ko le duro lati gba akoko lati ka.
The child asked more.	Ọmọ naa beere diẹ sii.
Her shoes are cut.	Awọn bata rẹ ti ge.
There is a cat watching you.	Ologbo kan wa ti n wo o.
But let’s say you can’t.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki a sọ pe ko le.
They will not tell me.	Wọn ko ni sọ fun mi.
It sounds good now.	O dun ni bayi.
He looked inside the garden.	O wo inu ọgba.
It is not in their plans.	Ko si ninu awọn eto wọn.
I have to wait.	Mo ni lati duro.
Everything seemed to be in place.	Ohun gbogbo dabi enipe o wa ni ibi.
It needs my attention.	O nilo akiyesi mi.
Of course not.	Dajudaju a ko.
I believe it is so good.	Mo gbagbọ pe o dara bẹ.
That's your problem, that's not my problem.	Iṣoro rẹ niyẹn, iyẹn kii ṣe iṣoro mi.
Everyone should read the following.	Gbogbo eniyan yẹ ki o ka awọn wọnyi.
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	O tumọ si, sọ sibẹsibẹ.
He’s talking he’s talking.	O n sọrọ o n sọrọ.
From sea, back to sea.	Lati okun, pada si okun.
I know I missed it.	Mo mọ pe Mo padanu rẹ.
All power, all inside.	Gbogbo agbara, gbogbo inu.
Money for schools.	Owo fun awọn ile-iwe.
Almost every car is made of metal.	O fẹrẹ jẹ pe gbogbo ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ jẹ irin.
They put energy into our energy.	Wọn fi agbara sinu agbara wa.
But that is why we can still let things happen.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ni idi ti a tun le jẹ ki awọn nkan ṣẹlẹ.
That's it over there.	Ti o ni rẹ lori nibẹ.
It is new and has not been explained before.	O jẹ tuntun ati pe ko ti ṣe alaye tẹlẹ.
But something else caught his attention.	Ṣugbọn ohun miiran mu akiyesi rẹ.
You have to know, but you refuse to go out.	O ni lati mọ, ṣugbọn o kọ lati jade.
It is not money at this point.	Kii ṣe owo ni aaye yii.
Not here.	Ko si nibi.
I know it is true.	Mo mọ pe o jẹ otitọ.
Your letter arrives too late.	Lẹta rẹ de pẹ ju.
Physical requirements.	Awọn ibeere ti ara.
It was a kind of family environment.	O jẹ iru ayika idile kan gaan.
If you have money, use it.	Ti o ba ni owo, lo.
There is no room for me.	Ko ba si aaye fun mi.
They have no money and no food.	Wọn ko ni owo ati pe wọn ko ni ounjẹ.
Here, life is not easy at all.	Nibi, igbesi aye ko rọrun rara.
I do not want you to miss out.	Emi ko fẹ ki o padanu.
Some days it looks like that.	Awọn ọjọ kan dabi iyẹn.
But whatever the reason, there we were.	Ṣugbọn ohunkohun ti idi, nibẹ a wà.
So a lot of things have happened in the last few days.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan ti ṣẹlẹ ni awọn ọjọ diẹ ti o kẹhin.
I never laughed back.	Emi ko rẹrin pada.
We agree on the most.	A gba lori julọ.
You have known for a long time that this will happen.	O ti mọ fun igba pipẹ pe yoo ṣẹlẹ.
They are not materials.	Wọn kii ṣe ohun elo.
It requires better working conditions.	O beere awọn ipo iṣẹ to dara julọ.
You pick it up and start over.	O gbe o si tun bẹrẹ.
Even not my advice.	Paapaa kii ṣe imọran mi.
You have to get it back.	O ni lati gba pada.
You must decide today.	O gbọdọ pinnu loni.
It's too fast.	O yara pupọ.
They want to hear it again.	Wọn fẹ lati gbọ ti o tun.
He was older than his eyes.	O ti dagba ju oju rẹ lọ.
We'll get them out at the last minute.	A yoo gba wọn jade ni iṣẹju to kẹhin.
I really thought about it.	Mo ro gan nipa rẹ.
We are happy.	O dun wa.
Some of them do not know any.	Diẹ ninu wọn ko mọ eyikeyi.
I watched it scared.	Mo ti wo o bẹru.
You have to be a woman.	O ni lati jẹ obinrin.
But time passed.	Ṣugbọn akoko kọja.
On top of that they don’t.	Lori oke wọn ko ṣe bẹ.
We are tired, but happy.	A rẹ wa, ṣugbọn dun.
He gave everything away.	O fun ohun gbogbo kuro.
They can not reach a decision.	Wọn ko le de ọdọ ipinnu kan.
The men were angry.	Awọn ọkunrin binu.
They say it is true.	Wọn sọ pe otitọ ni.
He almost killed her.	O fẹrẹ pa a.
It continued, and more doors appeared on both sides.	O tẹsiwaju, ati awọn ilẹkun diẹ sii han ni ẹgbẹ mejeeji.
There are two reasons.	Idi wọn jẹ meji.
He threw his hand to his forehead.	O ju ọwọ rẹ si iwaju oju rẹ.
The body is completely.	Ara wa patapata.
Can't find it.	Ko le ri.
He was with his wife.	O si wà pẹlu iyawo rẹ.
The bag is well stocked.	Apo naa ti di daradara.
I need to see it.	Mo nilo lati ri e.
You have missed the previous time.	O ti padanu akoko to tẹlẹ.
It’s an existing idea that goes.	O jẹ ero ti o wa ti o lọ.
I asked for.	Mo beere fun.
They asked how they could kill him.	Wọn beere bi wọn ṣe le pa a.
Do not leave the bag alone!	Maṣe fi apo naa silẹ nikan!
It seemed to continue forever.	O dabi enipe o tẹsiwaju lailai.
After that it was all clear.	Lẹhin ti o je gbogbo ko o.
They do not mean to change like this.	Wọn ko tumọ si pe ki o yipada bi eyi.
I could see my feet.	Mo ti le ri ẹsẹ mi.
But that is hard to accept.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn nira lati gba.
They have closed your eyes.	Wọn ti di oju rẹ.
You need people like you this way.	O nilo awọn eniyan ti o dabi rẹ ni ọna yii.
But not everyone is happy with that.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan ni o dun pẹlu iyẹn.
But history does not live that way.	Ṣugbọn itan ko gbe ni ọna yẹn.
That says a lot.	Iyẹn sọ pupọ.
I love that it doesn’t.	Mo nifẹ pe ko ṣe.
But he said nothing.	Sugbon ko so nkankan.
We really enjoyed them.	A gbadun wọn gaan.
It is also true that we are already here.	O tun jẹ otitọ pe a ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
If you are, do something else back.	Ti o ba wa, ṣe nkan miiran pada.
We will all miss it.	Gbogbo wa ni yoo padanu rẹ.
It has been abandoned.	O ti fi silẹ.
It is in this story.	O wa ninu itan yii.
The main issue has been the disadvantages for this group.	Ọrọ akọkọ ti jẹ awọn ipalara fun ẹgbẹ ipo yii.
We left the house.	A jade kuro ni ile naa.
This will not change anything.	Eyi kii yoo yi ohunkohun pada.
Nothing in me could get over the accident.	Nkankan ninu mi ko le kọja ijamba naa.
No question, of course.	Ko si ibeere, dajudaju.
I was the last one to leave.	Emi ni ẹni ikẹhin lati lọ kuro.
Maybe we should do something less.	Boya o yẹ ki a ṣe nkan ti o kere ju.
This of course does not seem to make much sense.	Eyi dajudaju ko dabi pe o ni oye pupọ.
They want to know why the test.	Wọn fẹ lati mọ idi ti idanwo naa.
See what they do.	Wo ohun ti wọn ṣe.
You have to know that they are there.	O ni lati mọ pe wọn wa nibẹ.
She lost her eyesight while driving.	O nu oju rẹ nigba ti o wakọ.
But we are only friends.	Ṣugbọn a jẹ ọrẹ nikan.
It is better placed than most to do so.	O ti wa ni dara julọ gbe ju julọ lati ṣe bẹ.
I know a lot.	Mo mọ pupọ.
He is not in any trouble.	Ko si ninu wahala kankan.
It might even have been better for him and everyone else.	O le paapaa ti dara julọ fun oun ati gbogbo eniyan miiran.
How do you see it already?	Bawo ni o ti ri tẹlẹ?
We all already know this.	Gbogbo wa ti mọ eyi tẹlẹ.
He has a house there.	O ni ile kan nibẹ.
It looks like you're trying to read my mind.	O dabi pe o n gbiyanju lati ka ọkan mi.
Or from yourself.	Tabi lati ara rẹ.
Most people go to town to work.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan n lọ si ilu lati ṣiṣẹ.
They are ideas.	Wọn jẹ awọn ero.
Which could be a big mistake.	Eyi ti o le jẹ aṣiṣe nla kan.
Neither men.	Bẹni awọn ọkunrin.
Well is not good.	Daradara ni ko dara.
He went again.	O tun lọ lẹẹkansi.
I work before work every day.	Mo ṣiṣẹ ṣaaju iṣẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
He is such a wonderful child.	O jẹ ọmọ iyanu bẹ.
He spent all day working.	O lo gbogbo ọjọ ṣiṣẹ.
I will be there for you as you are there for me.	Emi yoo wa nibẹ fun ọ bi o ṣe wa nibẹ fun mi.
Not if you are serious about your work.	Kii ṣe ti o ba ṣe pataki nipa iṣẹ rẹ.
It has come to you.	O ti wa si ọdọ rẹ.
It just didn't happen.	O kan ko ṣẹlẹ.
This can be a huge surprise.	Eyi le jẹ iyalẹnu nla julọ.
I say, not at all.	Mo sọ, kii ṣe rara.
His wife came to him and looked at him.	Iyawo re de odo re o si wo o.
You can hit, again.	O le lu, lẹẹkansi.
I didn’t know it was this week until last night.	Emi ko mọ pe o jẹ ọsẹ yii titi di alẹ kẹhin.
The baby will need rest.	Ọmọ naa yoo nilo isinmi.
This is not entirely true.	Eyi kii ṣe otitọ patapata.
It is very possible to write in a book.	O ṣee ṣe pupọ lati kọ sinu iwe kan.
Not ourselves.	Kii ṣe ara wa.
And you can.	Ati pe o le.
If the rain was great.	Ti o ba ti ojo ti o wà nla.
He brought his own up to meet her.	O mu awọn tirẹ soke lati pade rẹ.
It will take a little longer to get up.	Yoo gba to gun diẹ lati dide.
People like you are already growing up.	Awọn eniyan bii rẹ ti n dagba tẹlẹ.
We left the house.	A jade kuro ninu ile naa.
I only remember they were friends.	Mo ranti nikan wọn jẹ ọrẹ.
The sister did not understand what he was saying.	Arabinrin ko da ohun ti o sọ.
He was walking around the house.	O n rin ni ayika ile naa.
Just to get that in public.	O kan lati gba iyẹn ni gbangba.
Other members are at home as the months go by.	Awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ miiran wa ni ile bi awọn oṣu ti kọja.
I have to do better.	Mo ni lati ṣe dara.
I speak from my heart.	Mo sọ lati ọkan mi.
Often found in teenagers.	Nigbagbogbo a rii ni awọn ọdọ.
There is no reason to wait.	Ko si idi lati duro.
I highly recommend that you know this.	Mo ni imọran pupọ pe o mọ eyi.
Everything is fine a few hours ago.	Ohun gbogbo ti dara ni awọn wakati diẹ sẹhin.
I can be there with them.	Mo le wa nibẹ pẹlu wọn.
This, however, does not feel right.	Eyi, sibẹsibẹ, ko lero pe o tọ.
No, you should go.	Rara, o yẹ ki o lọ.
It’s what makes us special.	O jẹ ohun ti o jẹ ki a ṣe pataki.
Here is what he wrote.	Eyi ni ohun ti o kọ.
You need to run the test several times.	O nilo lati ṣiṣe idanwo naa ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
He talked about.	O si sọrọ nipa.
If you have any suggestions.	Ti o ba ni imọran eyikeyi.
Her first marriage was for love.	Igbeyawo akọkọ rẹ jẹ fun ifẹ.
We are celebrating!	A n ṣe ayẹyẹ!
It just doesn’t work that way.	O kan ko ṣiṣẹ ni ọna yẹn.
I have to really think about other people here, not just myself.	Mo ni lati ronu gaan nipa awọn eniyan miiran nibi, kii ṣe ara mi nikan.
He assured himself that he would remember well.	O da ara rẹ loju pe oun yoo ranti daradara.
One bad time.	Ọkan buburu akoko.
It happened.	O ṣẹlẹ.
Tell him what you read if you like.	Sọ ohun ti o ti ka fun u ti o ba fẹ.
That may sound like a good idea at a meeting.	Iyẹn le dabi imọran ti o dara ni ipade kan.
This idea is not yours.	Ero yii kii ṣe tirẹ.
Well, for years, maybe not.	O dara, fun awọn ọdun, boya rara.
You can also have embedded methods.	O tun le ni awọn ọna ti a fi sii.
Not a gaming machine.	Ko ẹrọ ere.
Nice to see it.	O dara lati ri i.
However, he refused to do it himself.	Sibẹsibẹ, o kọ lati ṣe ara rẹ.
How many times did you ask.	Igba melo ni o beere.
None of my grandparents did.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn obi obi mi ti o ṣe.
But it was amazing.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ iyanu.
Get that idea out of your head.	Gba ero yẹn kuro ni ori rẹ.
The work kept me going.	Iṣẹ naa pa mi mọ.
Working people you just get by, if.	Ṣiṣẹ eniyan ti o kan gba nipa, ti o ba ti.
She was always happy to help.	Inu rẹ nigbagbogbo dun lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
They are not.	Wọn ko wa.
More than that.	O ju bẹ lọ.
I don’t expect that understanding.	Emi ko nireti pe oye iyẹn.
Can't remember seeing him.	Ko le ranti ri i.
What you see is not surprising.	Ohun ti o rii kii ṣe iyalẹnu.
But you want to know more.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ lati mọ diẹ sii.
It took me a while to get out.	O gba mi igba diẹ lati jade.
Most people work at home these days.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ṣiṣẹ ni ile ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
I can’t go wrong on that point.	Emi ko le ṣe aṣiṣe lori aaye yẹn.
Another man closed his eyes.	Ọkunrin miiran pa oju rẹ.
Make sure they take care of your family.	O rii daju pe wọn yoo tọju idile rẹ.
He talks about his friends behind their backs.	O sọrọ nipa awọn ọrẹ rẹ lẹhin ẹhin wọn.
He was still in the office when he died.	O tun wa ni ọfiisi nigbati o ku.
The program is working as expected.	Eto naa n ṣiṣẹ bi o ti ṣe yẹ.
I received a letter from a friend.	Mo gba lẹta kan lati ọdọ ọrẹ kan.
He closed his eyes and fell asleep.	O si di oju rẹ ki o si sun.
They have not seen him yet.	Wọn ko tii ri i.
We spent all our money.	A lo gbogbo owo wa.
His power is everything.	Agbara rẹ ni ohun gbogbo.
You expect something.	O nireti ohun kan.
And he went down and followed him.	O si lọ silẹ, o si sare tọ ọ.
Who is the most intelligent person in the room?	Tani eniyan ti o ni oye julọ ninu yara naa?
I know how it works.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
A few years, maybe more.	Awọn ọdun diẹ, boya diẹ sii.
That was to help him get himself back on track.	Iyẹn jẹ fun iranlọwọ fun u lati gba ara rẹ pada.
Look at his back.	Wo ẹhin rẹ.
And yet, you need to try something, anything.	Ati sibẹsibẹ, o nilo lati gbiyanju nkankan, ohunkohun.
It makes you happy.	O mu inu rẹ dun.
You have to consider why we came to you.	O ni lati ro idi ti a fi wa si ọdọ rẹ.
They can even be used together in the same question.	Wọn le paapaa ṣee lo papọ ni ibeere kanna.
They grow families.	Wọn dagba idile.
None of them knew who that person was.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ti o mọ ẹni ti eniyan naa jẹ.
But it could not have been easier.	Ṣugbọn ko le ti rọrun.
It stays in the cold for a long time.	O duro ninu otutu fun igba pipẹ.
They will continue to break through.	Wọn yoo tẹsiwaju lati ya nipasẹ.
Simple advice.	Imọran ti o rọrun.
I just do not remember the details.	Mo kan ko ranti awọn alaye.
It has changed a lot.	O ti yipada pupọ.
Your first child.	Ọmọ rẹ akọkọ.
It makes you think.	O mu ki o ronu.
I like it, but my parents don’t.	Mo fẹran rẹ, ṣugbọn awọn obi mi ko ṣe.
He said no one was home.	O sọ pe ko si ẹnikan ni ile.
But they will only have daughters.	Ṣugbọn wọn yoo ni awọn ọmọbirin nikan.
He told me every day.	O sọ fun mi ni gbogbo ọjọ.
You can’t do both alone.	O ko le ṣe awọn mejeeji nikan.
That means jobs, that means a lot of things.	Iyẹn tumọ si awọn iṣẹ, iyẹn tumọ si ọpọlọpọ nkan.
Until one day you do.	Titi di ọjọ kan o ṣe.
Others cannot do this.	Awọn miiran ko le ṣe eyi.
Feeling like that would be nice.	Ni rilara bi iyẹn yoo dara.
He stayed there for several days, drinking.	O duro nibẹ fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọjọ, mimu.
Something must have been wrong.	Nkankan gbọdọ ti jẹ aṣiṣe.
He could not walk again.	Ko le rin lẹẹkansi.
Just look at me from your work.	O kan wo mi lati iṣẹ rẹ.
Do what you want.	Ṣe ohun ti o fẹ.
I pulled it out and let myself out.	Mo fa o si jẹ ki ara mi jade.
If you can help that would be great.	Ti o ba le ṣe iranlọwọ iyẹn yoo jẹ nla.
The house has seen good days.	Awọn ile ti ri dara ọjọ.
And it has.	Ati pe o ti ni.
But it has not changed.	Ṣugbọn ko yipada.
Stress on your own terms.	Wahala lori ara rẹ awọn ofin.
Steal the stuff.	Ji awọn nkan naa.
He set his eyes on the river.	O gbe oju re le odo.
It took me a while to figure that out.	O gba mi ni igba diẹ lati ro iyẹn jade.
Get home.	Gba ile.
Like or dislike.	O fẹ tabi korira.
The men's clothes were not strong.	Awọn aṣọ ti awọn ọkunrin naa ko ni okun.
You can very, very much.	O le pupọ, pupọ.
When you will try anything.	Nigbati o yoo gbiyanju ohunkohun.
I am going out.	Mo n jade.
The service is very enjoyable.	Iṣẹ naa dun pupọ.
Those who have the best plan for the seasons will do their best.	Awọn ti o ni eto ti o dara julọ fun awọn akoko yoo ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
I can't get it.	Nko le gba.
This material is easy to clean.	Ohun elo yii rọrun lati wẹ.
They do it by understanding.	Wọn ṣe nipasẹ oye.
He will eat.	Oun yoo jẹun.
I raised my hand to her.	Mo gbe ọwọ mi si oke rẹ.
You are right about that.	O tọ nipa iyẹn.
If not, wait another day.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, duro ni ọjọ miiran.
I read something here and there.	Mo ti ka nkan nibi ati nibẹ.
You know me.	O mọ mi.
What a task.	Kini iṣẹ ṣiṣe.
He spent most of the day with friends.	O si lo julọ ti awọn ọjọ pẹlu awọn ọrẹ.
When he looked up again, he was gone.	Nigbati o tun wo soke, o ti lọ.
Tell who found the information.	Sọ ẹniti o rii alaye naa.
The tone has changed.	Ohun orin ti yipada.
The way it was sometimes.	Awọn ọna ti o wà ma.
We must call all our resources.	A gbọdọ pe gbogbo awọn ohun elo wa.
He died a few years ago.	O ku ni ọdun diẹ sẹhin.
Something is happening outside.	Nkankan n ṣẹlẹ ni ita.
And he loved his life.	O si fẹ aye re.
We wouldn’t want that.	A ko ni fẹ iyẹn.
But you know it.	Ṣugbọn o mọ ọ.
Doing something does not matter.	Ṣiṣe nkan ko ṣe nkankan.
But some of us have the power we want to give back.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu wa ni agbara ti a fẹ lati fun pada.
Clothing is new.	Aṣọ jẹ tuntun.
He did not lose his family.	Ko padanu idile rẹ.
Not just books,	Kii ṣe awọn iwe nikan,
And it’s better than good.	Ati pe o dara ju ti o dara lọ.
Apply for an hour.	Kan fun wakati kan.
They are watching them.	Won n wo won.
Everyone has a story.	Gbogbo eniyan ni itan kan.
There is something small.	Nkan kekere kan wa.
I raise my head.	Mo gbe ori mi soke.
She loves it, really.	O fẹran rẹ, ni otitọ.
Only when the thought ends is there reality.	Nikan nigbati ero ba pari ni otitọ wa.
Maybe not like you.	Boya ko ṣe bi iwọ.
And please let me know.	Ati jọwọ jẹ ki mi mọ.
But look at everything that happened.	Ṣugbọn wo ohun gbogbo ti o ṣẹlẹ.
They said we could just talk to him in the morning.	Wọn sọ pe a kan le ba a sọrọ ni owurọ.
Are you walking to work?	Ṣe o rin lati ṣiṣẹ?
Something stopped me.	Nkankan da mi duro.
Some recorded because they were not possible.	Diẹ ninu awọn gba silẹ nitori wọn ko ṣee ṣe.
It's almost out.	O ti fẹrẹ jade.
Your hand.	Ọwọ rẹ.
Jump into bed.	Ga sinu ibusun.
We want people like you.	A fẹ awọn eniyan bi rẹ.
What they have done since then is important.	Ohun ti wọn ṣe lati igba yii lo ṣe pataki.
Ask your parents to write down your name.	Beere lọwọ awọn obi rẹ lati kọ orukọ rẹ silẹ.
In fact we can do this in reality, as we have seen now.	Ni otitọ a le ṣe eyi ni otitọ, bi a ti rii ni bayi.
He said he went because he was scared.	O sọ pe o lọ nitori pe o bẹru.
I'm happy.	Inu mi dun.
They have scared us too.	Wọn ti bẹru wa pẹlu.
The car looks good.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa wo dara.
I was only there one night.	Mo wa nibẹ nikan ni alẹ kan.
But this is my father.	Ṣugbọn eyi ni baba mi.
She tried to remember the place but could not.	O gbiyanju lati ranti ibiti ṣugbọn ko le.
Things will change.	Awọn nkan yoo yipada.
I hope you are well soon.	Mo nireti pe o dara laipẹ.
She is the mother of two boys and a girl.	O jẹ iya ti awọn ọmọkunrin meji ati ọmọbirin kan.
This area is known for its beautiful beaches.	Agbegbe yii ni a mọ fun eti okun ti o lẹwa.
It is a good place to go after drinking.	O jẹ ibi ti o dara lati lọ lẹhin mimu.
In fact, it is hot.	Ni otitọ, o gbona.
That has to be good.	Iyẹn ni lati dara.
Simple and good.	Rọrun ati ti o dara.
The bottom line out of my life.	Isalẹ silẹ jade ninu aye mi.
All that to say, we all love it.	Gbogbo iyẹn lati sọ, gbogbo wa nifẹ rẹ.
He came to stand and looked back up.	O wa lati duro ati ki o wo ẹhin soke.
Whether or not anyone is there, there is no way out of this.	Boya ẹnikẹni ko wa tabi ko si, ko si ọna jade ninu eyi.
Or whatever they are.	Tabi ohunkohun ti wọn jẹ.
Now it looks like one or two.	Bayi o dabi ọkan tabi meji.
You will have to see when you will go on vacation.	Iwọ yoo ni lati rii nigbati iwọ yoo lọ si isinmi.
I was feeling under the weather.	Mo ti rilara labẹ oju ojo.
I really need some advice.	Mo nilo imọran kan gaan.
They make a good living because they get good money.	Wọn ṣe igbesi aye to dara nitori wọn gba owo daradara.
This is the first time you have thought of such a thing.	Eyi ni igba akọkọ ti o ti ronu iru nkan bẹẹ.
It's a book.	Iwe kan ni.
Neither said anything about seeing me again.	Bẹni ko sọ ohunkohun nipa ri mi lẹẹkansi.
You should know better.	O yẹ ki o mọ daradara.
That means a lot to me.	Iyẹn tumọ si pupọ fun mi.
He also did not let me.	O tun ko jẹ ki mi.
No, no, no sleep.	Rara, rara, ko si oorun.
They have very little money.	Won ni gan kekere owo.
You can't see it anymore.	O ko le ri mọ.
This does not sound very good.	Eyi ko dun pupọ.
Not when he wants to touch her again.	Ko nigba ti o fe fi ọwọ kan rẹ lẹẹkansi.
But this is not the case.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe eyi.
I’m talking about people.	Mo n sọrọ nipa awọn eniyan.
She wants to feel it again.	O fe lati lero rẹ si i lẹẹkansi.
She hated to leave him alone at night.	O korira lati fi i silẹ nikan ni alẹ.
They go, they go.	Wọn lọ, wọn lọ.
You don't really need it.	O ko nilo rẹ gaan.
I do not want to die.	Nko fe ku.
He heard, but did not understand.	O gbọ, ṣugbọn ko loye.
Explain what you can do for them.	Ṣe alaye ohun ti o le ṣe fun wọn.
But that is not completely understood.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ni oye patapata.
This helps one for two reasons.	Eyi ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọkan fun awọn idi meji.
Food for one.	Ounjẹ fun ọkan.
This can go many ways.	Eyi le lọ ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna.
There are things you are interested in that they can do with it.	Awọn nkan ti o nifẹ si wa ti wọn le ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
That's right, another.	Iyẹn tọ, miiran.
And you have the boats yourself.	Ati pe o ni awọn ọkọ oju omi funrararẹ.
Our breakfast was delicious.	Ounjẹ owurọ wa dun.
Very much not something you are interested in.	Pupọ julọ kii ṣe nkan ti o nifẹ si.
Stop and think about this.	Duro ronu nipa eyi.
It is done.	O ti ṣe.
It is powerful and it looks new.	O jẹ agbara ati pe o dabi tuntun.
They have been put in place.	A ti fi wọn si aaye.
Again, this is not new information.	Lẹẹkansi, eyi kii ṣe alaye tuntun.
And there are many of them.	Ati pe ọpọlọpọ rẹ wa.
The men returned home with a big reward to this place.	Awọn ọkunrin naa pada si ile pẹlu ere nla si ibi yii.
But this is very doubtful right now.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ ṣiyemeji pupọ ni bayi.
I will be fine now.	Emi yoo dara ni bayi.
We never lost any time in going to work.	A ko padanu akoko kankan ni lilọ si iṣẹ.

Only truth be told.	Otitọ nikan ni o sọ.
Life comes together.	Igbesi aye wa papọ.
I am your mother.	Emi ni iya rẹ.

Not three minutes, but three days.	Ko iṣẹju mẹta, ṣugbọn ọjọ mẹta.
But the trouble continues.	Ṣugbọn wahala naa tẹsiwaju.
After the fire, police took details.	Lẹhin ti ina, awọn ọlọpa mu awọn alaye.
It’s the amount we get on.	O jẹ iye ti a gba lori.

More than that need not be said.	Diẹ sii ju iyẹn ko nilo lati sọ.

The power went out completely.	Ina agbara ko jade patapata.
Better not to have children.	Dara julọ lati ma ni awọn ọmọde.

He didn't hit him well.	Ko lu u daradara.
Take care of children.	Tọju awọn ọmọde.

He did not forget the song.	Ko gbagbe orin naa.

A few hours into it we lose energy.	Awọn wakati diẹ sinu rẹ a padanu agbara.
This is my life, this is it.	Eyi ni igbesi aye mi, eyi ni.
The trees grow well here.	Awọn igi dagba daradara nibi.
We must meet the deadline.	A gbọdọ pade akoko ipari.
The program will not work at all.	Eto naa ko ni ṣiṣẹ rara.
No one even thought of it.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ronu rẹ paapaa.
We cannot be sure what you will do with that information.	A ko le ni idaniloju ohun ti iwọ yoo ṣe pẹlu alaye yẹn.
I rejected it.	Mo kọ ọ silẹ.
Maybe you think it's hot.	Boya o ro pe o gbona.

And that’s not easy.	Ati pe iyẹn ko rọrun.
Both boys have learned to swim in the river.	Awọn ọmọkunrin mejeeji ti kọ ẹkọ lati wẹ ninu odo.

That may be an interesting question.	Iyẹn le jẹ ibeere ti o nifẹ si.
He should not be your friend.	Ko yẹ lati jẹ ọrẹ rẹ.
What you ask for is true.	Ohun ti o beere ni otitọ.
Learn hard, or you will end up with nothing.	Kọ ẹkọ lile, tabi iwọ yoo pari pẹlu ohunkohun.
Maybe it will never happen again.	Boya kii yoo ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
There are several cars on the parking lot.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ pupọ lo wa lori aaye pa.
If no one sees it.	Ti enikeni ko ba ri i.
You are right about that.	O tọ nipa iyẹn.
Of course you can come through.	Dajudaju o le wa nipasẹ.
Even not my father.	Paapaa kii ṣe baba mi.
Know how much you have and how much it is.	Mọ iye ti o ni ati iye ti o jẹ.
Here is my question to you.	Ibeere mi si e ni eyi.
We pay our bills.	A san owo wa.
Walk out of school.	Rin jade ti ile-iwe.
I wonder what the kids would like most.	Mo ṣe iyalẹnu kini awọn ọmọ yoo fẹran julọ.
Maybe there were some.	Boya diẹ ninu awọn wà.

Let it out, let it out!	Jẹ ki o jade, jẹ ki o jade!
Now you have to help me.	Bayi iwọ ni lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi.
They are not well understood.	A ko loye wọn daradara.
They all want to be on your site.	Gbogbo wọn fẹ lati wa ni aaye rẹ.
Love knows nothing but love.	Ifẹ ko mọ nkan miiran ju ifẹ lọ.

Just know you are there.	O kan mọ pe o wa nibẹ.
I treat them like my own children.	Mo tọju wọn bi wọn ṣe jẹ ọmọ mi.

I have a personal story with him.	Mo ni itan ti ara ẹni pẹlu rẹ.

There are a lot of people doing this, not just one.	O jẹ ọpọlọpọ eniyan n ṣe eyi, kii ṣe ọkan nikan.
Not that much of it.	Ko pe Elo ti o.
The fire truck is behind it.	Ọkọ ina naa wa lẹhin rẹ.
He came back wanting more.	O tun pada wa o fẹ diẹ sii.
They say many people have died.	Wọn sọ pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan ti ku.
Do you like to travel by plane?	Ṣe o nifẹ lati rin irin-ajo ninu ọkọ ofurufu?
He did not return to the room as he had before.	Ko pada si yara bi o ti jẹ tẹlẹ.
I didn’t do that, well, ever.	Emi ko ṣe iyẹn, daradara, lailai.
You already know.	O ti mọ ni bayi.
I could have talked to him on the phone at some point.	Mo le ti ba a sọrọ lori foonu ni akoko kan.
Don't listen back.	Maṣe gbọ pada.
Without them, you would die.	Laisi wọn, iwọ yoo ku.
They are very good.	Wọn dara gaan.
And everything looks very, very new.	Ati pe ohun gbogbo dabi pupọ, tuntun pupọ.
That is very surprising.	Iyẹn jẹ iyalẹnu pupọ.
I need to see your face.	Mo nilo lati ri oju rẹ.

To give yourself time to get out of town.	Lati fun ara rẹ ni akoko lati jade kuro ni ilu.
We are not locked.	A ko ti ilẹkun.

Just make sure you know about it ahead of time.	O kan rii daju pe o mọ nipa rẹ ṣaaju akoko.
You need to explain it.	O nilo lati ṣe alaye rẹ.
Everything is going to be good.	Ohun gbogbo ti a ti lilọ si dara.

This is similar to another problem.	Eyi jẹ iru iru si iṣoro miiran.
We do not have.	A ko ni awọn.
He always does.	O ṣe nigbagbogbo.
I do not know what that is all about.	Emi ko mọ kini iyẹn jẹ gbogbo nipa.
And that would be true.	Ati pe eyi yoo jẹ otitọ.
Lots of problems.	Awọn iṣoro pupọ.
He was always someone that people heard.	O nigbagbogbo jẹ ẹnikan ti eniyan gbọ.
Hold me hard.	Di mi mu lile.
You will have to wait and see.	Iwọ yoo ni lati duro ati rii.
That's worth a drink.	Iyẹn yẹ ohun mimu.
There is no time at all.	Ko wa ni akoko rara.
Anyone who wants to can learn to drive.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ba fẹ le kọ ẹkọ lati wakọ.
See, we have not forgotten.	Wo, a ko gbagbe.
Others no one seems to have used.	Awọn miiran ko si ọkan dabi lati ti lo.
We have to take care of ourselves.	A ni lati tọju ara wa.
I will miss you, he said.	Emi yoo padanu rẹ, o sọ.
You have to help.	O ni lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
I, too, at that time.	Emi naa, ni akoko yẹn.
So it depends on the type of agreement.	Nitorina o da lori iru adehun.
That is very beautiful.	Iyẹn jẹ lẹwa pupọ.
Such is not the case.	Iru bẹ ko ri bẹ.
It’s getting easier now.	O ti n rọrun ni bayi.
Only two simple people.	Awọn eniyan ti o rọrun meji nikan.
I don't think so.	Mo kọ̀ ọ́.
There will always be.	Nigbagbogbo yoo wa.
However, he does not seem to be able to remove them.	Sibẹsibẹ, o dabi pe ko le mu wọn kuro.

Doing so is beneficial for several reasons.	Ṣiṣe bẹ jẹ anfani fun awọn idi pupọ.
No heat.	Ko si ooru.
Be a single mother.	Jẹ iya nikan.

There is nothing to worry about, nothing to fear.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣe aniyan nipa, ko si nkankan lati bẹru.

He does not own it.	Oun ko ni tirẹ.
Probably not.	O jasi ko wa.
But they are there.	Ṣugbọn wọn wa nibẹ.
Some have, some have not.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni, diẹ ninu awọn ti ko.
It’s about the skills for a project.	O jẹ nipa awọn ọgbọn fun iṣẹ kan.
It’s just too much, for some reason.	O kan fẹrẹ pupọ ju, fun idi kan.
There are several reasons for this.	Awọn idi pupọ lo wa ti kii ṣe.
He got up to leave.	O dide lati lọ kuro.
For most people obviously.	Fun ọpọlọpọ eniyan ti o han gbangba.

These faces were not used in the original work.	A ko lo awọn oju wọnyi ni iṣẹ akọkọ.
So sit down.	Nitorina joko.
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.	Ounjẹ owurọ jẹ ounjẹ pataki julọ ti ọjọ naa.
And he will do what you ask.	Ati pe yoo ṣe ohun ti o beere.
We will decide what happens there.	A yoo pinnu ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nibẹ.
Write a position statement about yourself.	Kọ alaye ipo kan nipa ara rẹ.
You can very much say that you will not work with me.	O le ni pupọ julọ sọ pe iwọ kii yoo ṣiṣẹ pẹlu mi.
It’s not around boys who might be your kids.	Ko ni ayika awọn ọmọkunrin ti o le jẹ ọmọ rẹ.
He was thinking, fast.	O n ronu, yara.
But it looks great.	Ṣugbọn o wo pupọ.

They both shook their heads.	Awon mejeeji mi ori won.
Eyes on your body can do nothing.	Oju lori ara rẹ ko le ṣe ohunkohun.

A clean city is important.	Ilu ti o mọ jẹ pataki.

The more information you put into them, the better.	Alaye diẹ sii ti o fi sinu wọn, dara julọ.
You have done very well.	O ti ṣe daradara pupọ.
A few times a year.	Awọn igba diẹ ni ọdun kan.

There are several ways.	Ọna pupọ wa.
I do not know how old he was when he wrote it.	Emi ko mọ bi o ti jẹ ọdun nigbati o kọ ọ.
So how do we reach this conclusion?	Nitorina bawo ni a ṣe de ipari yii?
Do not use this yet.	Maṣe lo eyi sibẹsibẹ.
Say more.	Sọ diẹ.
At the point, this.	Ni aaye, eyi.
When you go out at night.	Nigbati o ba jade ni alẹ.
All of that is a mistake.	Gbogbo nkan yẹn jẹ aṣiṣe aṣiṣe.
He met her.	O pade rẹ.
You can buy anything there.	O le ra ohunkohun nibẹ.
Said it was too much.	So wipe o je ju Elo.
Big and hard.	Nla ati lile.

She was the first girl in her class.	O jẹ ọmọbirin akọkọ ninu kilasi rẹ.
Let me watch those songs again.	Jẹ ki n tun wo awọn orin yẹn lẹẹkansi.
That’s my point in that that’s not what it will take.	Iyẹn ni aaye mi ni iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti yoo mu.
But it was good for me.	Ṣugbọn o dara fun mi.
So just wait for me.	Nitorina o kan duro fun mi.
I think you should think this over.	Mo ro pe o yẹ ki o ronu eyi lori.
My head is too full.	Ori mi ti kun ju.
That is not why we are here.	Eyi kii ṣe idi ti a fi wa nibi.

You do not know with a dog.	O ko mọ pẹlu kan aja.
You do not have to wear it every day to benefit.	O ko ni lati wọ ni gbogbo ọjọ lati ni anfani.
He has not seen it.	Ko tii ri i.
I'm not happy about that.	Emi ko dun nipa eyi.
First, we need to buy clean drinking water.	Ni akọkọ, a nilo lati ra omi mimu ti o mọ.
If anyone can see it you can.	Ti ẹnikẹni ba le ri i o le.
He thought he did not understand.	O ro pe ko loye.

He put the paper bag in the living room.	O gbe apo iwe naa sinu yara isinmi.
He photographed her for many years.	O ya aworan rẹ fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
Here is a way to get it.	Eyi jẹ ọna kan lati gba.
I try to bring myself back to the present.	Mo gbiyanju lati mu ara mi pada si bayi.
It has come up.	O ti wa soke.
This is a very important issue.	Eyi jẹ ọrọ ti o ṣe pataki pupọ.
But it doesn’t always work that way.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe nigbagbogbo ṣiṣẹ ni ọna yẹn.
It says a lot about these people.	O sọ pupọ nipa awọn eniyan wọnyi.
It did not change my work.	Ko yi iṣẹ mi pada.
Kind of like a sister.	Iru bi arabinrin.
And there are no children.	Ati pe ko si awọn ọmọde.
It has to be work, school.	O ni lati jẹ iṣẹ, ile-iwe.
And we almost did.	Ati pe a fẹrẹ ṣe.
The truth is that you can.	Otitọ ni pe o le.
Can that car go fast?	Njẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yẹn le yara yara bi?
The money passed with a lot more.	Owo naa kọja pẹlu ọpọlọpọ pupọ.
Think only of yourself.	Ronu ti ara rẹ nikan.
Nothing seemed to do that, however.	Ko si ohun ti o dabi enipe lati ṣe pe, sibẹsibẹ.
So another time.	Nitorina akoko miiran.
But you know that.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe.
At least the story is over.	O kere ju ki itan naa lọ.
I went back.	Mo pada sẹhin.
Do whatever you decide to do as soon as possible.	Ṣe ohunkohun ti o pinnu lati yẹ ni kete bi o ti le.
If money is because of you, you can’t get it back.	Ti owo ba jẹ nitori rẹ, ko le gba pada.
She is not in love with him.	O ko ni ife pẹlu rẹ.
A big accident happened.	Ijamba nla kan ṣẹlẹ.
Locals, however, are not yet on board.	Awọn agbegbe, sibẹsibẹ, ko sibẹsibẹ lori ọkọ.
There is nothing wrong with this game.	Ko si ohun ti ko tọ si pẹlu ere yi.
We are not sure this will sound good.	A ko da wa loju pe eyi yoo dun.
I've read enough.	Mo ti ka iwe to.
People who don’t.	Eniyan ti ko ṣe.
I usually do.	Mo maa n ṣe.
Thoughts get angry.	Awọn ero ti binu.
Do not say die.	Maṣe sọ pe ku.
That can be very difficult.	Iyẹn le gan.
Do not tell them anything.	Maṣe sọ ohun kan fun wọn.
But of course they do.	Ṣugbọn dajudaju wọn ṣe.
That doesn't sound right.	Iyẹn ko dun rara.
All tests were performed at the same time of day.	Gbogbo awọn idanwo ni a ṣe ni akoko kanna ti ọjọ.
A family lives in this house.	Idile kan ngbe ni ile yii.
I can’t keep back to that.	Emi ko le pa pada si iyẹn.
He will not meet my eyes.	Oun ko ni pade oju mi.
They will meet another day.	Wọn yoo pade ọjọ miiran.
That makes it possible.	Iyẹn jẹ ki o le.
Sometimes this happens two or three times that night.	Nigba miiran eyi ṣẹlẹ ni igba meji tabi mẹta ni alẹ kanna.
She loves to write.	O nifẹ lati kọ.
You must know that.	O gbọdọ mọ pe.
We just look.	A kan wo.
On the other hand, it just looks like home.	Ni ọwọ yẹn, o kan dabi ile.
He never thought.	Ko ronu rara.
I have no idea how these children feel.	Emi ko ni imọran rara bi awọn ọmọ wọnyi ṣe rilara.
You do the best you can.	O ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ ti o le.
I am very tired of having power for everyone.	O rẹ mi pupọ lati ni agbara fun gbogbo eniyan.
We'll see what happens.	A yoo rii ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
You will be angry.	Iwọ yoo binu.
He seemed a little angry.	O dabi enipe o binu diẹ.
I would really like a vacation this year.	Emi yoo fẹ isinmi ni ọdun yii gaan.
Now it seems to be in question.	Bayi o dabi pe o wa ni ibeere.
He wanted to run teams.	O fe lati ṣiṣe awọn ẹgbẹ.
I remember the dog but did not remember his name.	Mo ranti aja ṣugbọn ko ranti orukọ rẹ.
By the very least, that is.	Nipa pupọ julọ, iyẹn ni.
That's the point.	Ọrọ rẹ̀ niyẹn.
Whatever it is, it is important not to delay.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ, o ṣe pataki lati ma ṣe pẹ.
And that will not change.	Ati pe ki yoo yipada.
This is, of course, beaten beyond.	Eyi jẹ, dajudaju, lu kọja.
There is a better way.	Ọna to dara julọ wa.
They have worked on it.	Wọn ti ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ.
Past performance is nothing like this.	Iṣẹ ṣiṣe ti o kọja ko jẹ ohunkohun bii eyi.
These rules are very simple.	Awọn ofin wọnyi rọrun pupọ.
This does not work for me.	Eyi ko ṣiṣẹ fun mi.
I don’t know that much about it.	Emi ko mọ iyẹn pupọ nipa rẹ.
Forget about cars.	Gbagbe nipa awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
I don’t know why men wear it.	Emi ko mọ idi ti awọn ọkunrin fi wọ.
He could not do this for very long.	Ko le ṣe eyi fun pipẹ pupọ.
There is no room to look back.	Ko si aaye lati wo ẹhin.
She usually goes to bed early.	Nigbagbogbo o lọ sun ni kutukutu.
I stayed at home with them.	Mo duro ni ile pẹlu wọn.
You’ve seen it come and go.	O ti rii pe o wa ki o lọ.
He thought more.	O ro diẹ sii.
We have already seen this story.	A ti rii itan yii tẹlẹ.
Others say, but consider this.	Awọn miiran sọ, ṣugbọn ṣe akiyesi eyi.
I have only been married to her before.	Emi nikan ni iyawo rẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
And that was the problem up to my mother.	Ati pe iyẹn ni iṣoro naa titi de ọdọ iya mi.
These are the same players.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn ẹrọ orin kanna.
It's pretty worth it to me.	O ni lẹwa tọ to fun mi.
This causes problems.	Eyi fa awọn iṣoro.
If you have a few minutes, try it now.	Ti o ba ni awọn iṣẹju diẹ, gbiyanju ni bayi.
He did so much in the matter.	O ṣe pupọ julọ ninu ọrọ naa.
See, they will not open.	Wo, wọn kii yoo ṣii.
And on the first trip no one did that.	Ati ni irin-ajo akọkọ ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe bẹ.
There was no thought at that time, and no feeling.	Ko si ero ni akoko yẹn, ko si si rilara.
We now believe you should receive your gift.	A gbagbọ bayi o yẹ ki o gba ẹbun rẹ.
But we don’t have time right now.	Ṣugbọn a ko ni akoko ni bayi.
Sorry, can't.	Ma binu, ko le ṣe.
These are.	Awọn wọnyi ni.
One good wish will do it.	Ọkan ti o dara fe yoo se o.
And that is starting to change.	Ati pe iyẹn bẹrẹ lati yipada.
We stayed a week and the conditions were great.	A duro ọsẹ kan ati awọn ipo jẹ nla.
You should finish the project this afternoon.	O yẹ ki o pari iṣẹ naa ni ọsan yii.
She wore her hair long.	O wọ irun rẹ gun.
He was the right friend to have.	O jẹ ọrẹ ti o tọ lati ni.
We don’t know much.	A ko mọ pupọ.
Living conditions are also surprising.	Awọn ipo igbesi aye tun jẹ iyalẹnu.
He hated cats.	O korira ologbo.
One day your story will be written.	Ni ojo kan itan rẹ yoo kọ.
I still love the way though.	Mo tun fẹran ọna sibẹsibẹ.
We have grown.	A ti dagba.
Some weeks are better than others.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọsẹ dara ju awọn miiran lọ.
It is my job.	Iṣẹ́ mi ni.
Hands were on edge.	Ọwọ wà lori eti.
He slept longer than he ate.	O sun gun ju ti o je.
That is for that.	Iyẹn jẹ fun iyẹn.
You know we are here.	O mọ pe a wa nibi.
Nearby took me back.	Nitosi tun gba mi pada.
They tested the strength of the rope.	Wọn ṣe idanwo agbara okun naa.
However, not for.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko fun.
Sometimes, it works.	Nigba miiran, o ṣiṣẹ.
Or even the day before.	Tabi paapaa ọjọ ṣaaju.
That was a great thing for us this week.	Ohun nla niyẹn fun wa ni ọsẹ yii.
He gave himself completely to me.	O fi ara rẹ fun mi patapata.
Again, he asked the same question.	Lẹẹkansi, o beere ibeere kanna.
I’m not even sure how to make it understandable.	Emi ko paapaa ni idaniloju bi o ṣe le jẹ ki o ni oye.
Sometimes, it just doesn’t wake up.	Nigba miiran, o kan ko ni ji.
It is never too late to change your mind.	Ko ti pẹ ju lati yi ọkan rẹ pada.
I love it, and continue to love it.	Mo nifẹ rẹ, ati tẹsiwaju lati nifẹ rẹ.
The broken leg has finished its work.	Ẹsẹ ti o fọ ti pari iṣẹ rẹ.
There are two people here.	Eniyan meji wa nibi.
No one remains.	Ko si ọkan maa wà.
Talked to someone.	Ti sọrọ si ẹnikan.
You’ve made it up.	O ti ṣe e soke.
The reason you don’t know must be.	Idi ti o ko mọ gbọdọ jẹ.
It has power from within.	O ni agbara lati inu rẹ.
He can’t give her anything more than she already has.	Ko le fun u ni ohunkohun ju ti o ti ni tẹlẹ lọ.
Your help is needed to continue this work.	A nilo iranlọwọ rẹ lati tẹsiwaju iṣẹ yii.
At night,	Ni alẹ,
In fact we did not.	Ni otitọ a ko ṣe.
Have fun!.	Gbadun!.
It was called a day job.	O pe ni iṣẹ ọjọ kan.
I walk away a lot, many times a year.	Mo rin kuro ni ọpọlọpọ, ọpọlọpọ igba ni ọdun.
She finished her drink.	O pari ohun mimu rẹ.
You can do better.	O le ṣe dara julọ.
The weather will be nice today.	Oju ojo yoo dara loni.
He made decisions from then on.	O ṣe awọn ipinnu lati igba yii lọ.
When he passed people, there was no one in his class.	Nigbati o kọja awọn eniyan, ko si ẹnikan ninu kilasi rẹ.
Last week, he had a big celebration.	Ni ọsẹ to kọja, o ṣe ayẹyẹ nla kan.
The proper bed system is on the way.	Ọna ibusun to dara n lọ ni ọna.
The very first day.	Ọjọ akọkọ gan.
I left the book on the table.	Mo fi iwe naa silẹ lori tabili.
He wanted nothing to do with it.	Ko fe nkankan lati se pẹlu rẹ.
They hate us.	Wọn korira wa.
I do not believe that life can continue like this.	Emi ko gbagbọ pe igbesi aye le tẹsiwaju bi eyi.
Get the money.	Gba owo naa.
It’s a long way to go, don’t you think?	O jẹ ọna pipẹ lati rin, ṣe o ko ro?
I see you will need help.	Mo rii pe iwọ yoo nilo iranlọwọ.
Her age and we were never touched.	Ọjọ ori rẹ ati pe a ko fi ọwọ kan rara.
You always miss your deadlines.	Nigbagbogbo o padanu awọn akoko ipari rẹ.
He has not said a word since he got into the car.	Ko tii sọ ọrọ kan lati igba ti o wọ inu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
And if so, what are their thoughts.	Ati pe ti o ba jẹ bẹ, kini awọn ero wọn.
You must have done a lot of work to do this.	O gbọdọ ti ṣe ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ lati ṣe eyi.
Or it was raining that night.	Tabi ojo n ro ni alẹ yẹn.
You can’t get enough sleep if you sleep too late.	O ko le gba oorun ti o to ti o ba n sun oorun pẹ ju.
But it can’t be just the police.	Ṣugbọn ko le jẹ ọlọpa nikan.
It’s time for a new approach.	O to akoko fun ọna tuntun.
There are other reasons, too.	Awọn idi miiran wa, paapaa.
Children always bring something for the teacher.	Awọn ọmọde nigbagbogbo mu nkan wa fun olukọ.
Or you go to a group meeting.	Tabi o lọ si ipade ti ẹgbẹ.
Try some to see if they do.	Gbiyanju diẹ ninu awọn lati rii boya wọn ti ṣe.
Human life is human life.	Igbesi aye eniyan ni igbesi aye eniyan.
It's work time.	Akoko ise ni.
This is a very difficult test.	Eyi jẹ idanwo ti o nira pupọ.
At first it was very good.	Ni akọkọ o dara pupọ.
That's when he was.	Ti o ni nigbati o wà.
We missed something.	A padanu nkankan.
But he knew the old saying.	Ṣugbọn o mọ ọrọ atijọ naa.
Life has to go on.	Igbesi aye ni lati tẹsiwaju.
Be a man about it.	Jẹ ọkunrin nipa rẹ.
Maybe this is not surprising to you.	Boya eyi kii ṣe iyalẹnu fun ọ.
He builds communities.	O kọ awọn agbegbe.
But good.	Ṣugbọn o dara.
But it is too late.	Sugbon o ti pẹ ju.
The price will go down as the days go by.	Iye owo naa yoo lọ silẹ bi awọn ọjọ ti kọja.
You are taking the law.	O n gba ofin.
It can be hard to let someone else go first.	O le jẹ lile lati jẹ ki ẹni miiran lọ ni akọkọ.
You can wait.	O le duro.
Not every idea is a good one.	Kii ṣe gbogbo imọran jẹ ọkan ti o dara.
Please do not ask me about it.	Jọwọ maṣe beere lọwọ mi nipa rẹ.
You get what you ask for.	O gba ohun ti o beere fun.
Well enough, it’s not a big deal.	Daradara to, kii ṣe adehun nla kan.
Fly up well.	Fo soke daradara.
Not as high as I am.	Ko ga bi emi.
You should not feel this way.	O yẹ ki o ko lero ni ọna yii.
They go on their own.	Wọn lọ funrararẹ.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	O dabi oju buburu,.
He has power.	O ni agbara.
I have already seen.	Mo ti ri tẹlẹ.
The sister has grown up.	Arabinrin naa ti dagba.
I just can’t believe myself.	Mo kan ko le gbagbọ ara mi.
It is informative.	Alaye ni.
Make sure both parents are there.	Rii daju pe awọn obi mejeeji wa nibẹ.
So much going on, so much to do.	Pupọ ti n lọ, pupọ lati ṣe.
Not for money.	Ko fun owo.
The problem is not that companies have them.	Iṣoro naa kii ṣe pe awọn ile-iṣẹ ni wọn.
You also get one.	O tun gba ọkan.
This is getting a good deal early in the day.	Eyi n gba nkan ti o dara ni kutukutu ọjọ.
I do not, however.	Emi ko, sibẹsibẹ.
Your team stands for their time.	Ẹgbẹ rẹ duro fun akoko wọn.
Not everyone came out at the same time.	Ko gbogbo eniyan wa jade ni akoko kanna.
But he would have loved more than that.	Ṣugbọn oun yoo ti fẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
So there is doubt.	Nitorina ṣiyemeji wa.
I do not like this.	Emi ko fẹ eyi.
Spend only one time.	Lo akoko kan nikan.
The time spent outdoors is especially important for older children.	Akoko ti o lo ni ita jẹ pataki paapaa fun awọn ọmọde dagba.
You may have mentioned my name.	O le ti sọ orukọ mi.
This will not be tolerated!	A ko ni fi aaye gba eyi!
That was the last time we really talked.	Iyẹn ni akoko ikẹhin ti a sọrọ gaan.
None of them sounds like you.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o dun bi iwọ.
They hit us hard.	Wọn lu wa pupọ.
We invited some old friends over for dinner.	A pe awọn ọrẹ atijọ kan wa fun ounjẹ alẹ.
This is a very important task.	Eyi jẹ iṣẹ ṣiṣe pataki kan.
Stick and use as needed.	Di ati lo bi o ṣe nilo.
You learn from your mistakes or you go backwards.	O kọ lati awọn aṣiṣe rẹ tabi o lọ sẹhin.
None of us were born there.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa ti a bi nibẹ.
Last night he thought it was how he looked.	Ni alẹ ana o ro pe bi o ṣe wo oun ni.
I would do such a thing.	Emi yoo ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ.
You must have known.	O gbọdọ ti mọ.
I asked another teacher.	Mo ti beere olukọ miiran.
You may find this helpful.	O le rii pe eyi ṣe iranlọwọ.
For the first time this year.	Fun igba akọkọ odun.

She loves to travel.	O nifẹ pupọ lati rin irin-ajo.
Now they will finish it.	Bayi wọn yoo pari rẹ.
But there are also some problems.	Ṣugbọn awọn iṣoro kan tun wa.
But that is not our point.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe aaye wa.
We walked from here.	A rin lati ibi.
The city is at a crossroads.	Ilu naa wa ni ipade ọna meji.
Those good old days.	Awon ti o dara atijọ ọjọ.
Okay, that’s where you made a big mistake.	O dara, iyẹn ni ibi ti o ṣe aṣiṣe nla kan.
That boy was breaking my heart!	Ọmọkunrin yẹn n fọ ọkan mi!
The game is not over!	Awọn ere ni ko lori!
That is what they taught me.	Nkan ti won ko mi niyen.
It looks like your body, only more so.	O dabi ara rẹ, nikan diẹ sii bẹ.
She wants you to know how much she loves you.	O fẹ ki o mọ iye ti o nifẹ rẹ.
I felt like me again.	Mo ro bi mi lẹẹkansi.
It looks great.	O wo pupọ.
And yet it makes me believe.	Ati sibẹsibẹ o jẹ ki mi gbagbọ.
Please let me know about this.	Jọwọ jẹ ki mi mọ nipa eyi.
He could not do anything with it.	Ko le ṣe ohunkohun pẹlu rẹ.
They should not have.	Wọn ko yẹ ki o ni.
It still remains the same.	O si tun maa wa kanna.
Not through him.	Kii ṣe nipasẹ rẹ.
I do not know what.	Emi ko mọ kini.
People call me wrong.	Awọn eniyan pe mi ni aṣiṣe.
I have tried, but this is really good.	Mo ti gbiyanju, ṣugbọn eyi dara julọ ni otitọ.
This rule does not apply to this position.	Ofin yii ko le lo si ipo yii.
Love that too.	Nifẹ iyẹn paapaa.
Everything that matters is easy to reach the feet.	Ohun gbogbo ti o ṣe pataki jẹ rọrun lati de ọdọ awọn ẹsẹ.
This is here, and there and there.	Eyi nibi, ati nibẹ ati nibẹ.
He walked on.	O rin lori.
It can do wonders for you !.	O le ṣe ohun iyanu fun ọ!.
There was a boy who could not remember his name now.	Ọmọkunrin kan wa ti ko le ranti orukọ rẹ ni bayi.
But he has spoken his mind.	Ṣugbọn o ti sọ ọrọ rẹ.
There are several reasons for this.	Awọn idi pupọ lo wa fun rẹ.
I can give you their name.	Mo le fun ọ ni orukọ wọn.
Try to hit hard.	Gbiyanju lati lu lile.
You have nothing to fear from us.	O ko ni nkankan lati bẹru lati wa.
We get through it.	A gba nipasẹ rẹ.
Little things like that.	Awọn nkan kekere bi iyẹn.
Our company lost money last year.	Ile-iṣẹ wa padanu owo ni ọdun to kọja.
You will not love these news.	Iwọ kii yoo nifẹ awọn iroyin yii.
The sun has set.	Oorun ti lọ silẹ.
It helped me to ask if you would get a contract.	O ran mi lati beere boya iwọ yoo gba adehun kan.
What kind of food do you like?	Iru ounjẹ wo ni o fẹran?
She loves to talk a lot.	O nifẹ lati sọrọ pupọ.
This is a place for relaxation.	Eyi jẹ aaye fun isinmi.
It's about as anything as nothing can be.	O ni nipa bi ohunkohun bi ohunkohun ko le jẹ.
It makes me feel good about myself.	O jẹ ki ara mi dara nipa ara mi.
The sister was fine in bed.	Arabinrin naa dara ni ibusun.
The company denied any wrongdoing.	Ile-iṣẹ naa kọ eyikeyi aṣiṣe.
But the father who drove, is gone.	Ṣugbọn baba ti o wakọ, ti lọ.
He said it was good.	O sọ pe o dara.
But money changed everything.	Ṣugbọn owo yi ohun gbogbo pada.
I need something to call you.	Mo nilo nkankan lati pe e.
Everything is fine.	Ohun gbogbo ti dara.
He lives nearby.	O ngbe nitosi.
I turned to look at it.	Mo yipada lati wo o.
This is the day your life really started.	Eyi ni ọjọ ti igbesi aye rẹ bẹrẹ gaan.
Students are allowed to go home early today.	Wọn gba awọn ọmọ ile-iwe laaye lati lọ si ile ni kutukutu loni.
I have refused to do so.	Mo ti kọ lati ṣe bẹ.
It becomes more harmful to you.	O di ipalara si ọ diẹ sii.
And it’s always beautiful.	Ati pe o lẹwa nigbagbogbo.
Anyone who sees the child.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ba ri ọmọ naa.
More big fires are expected this year.	Awọn ina nla diẹ sii ni a nireti ni ọdun yii.
People help each other.	Eniyan ran ara wọn lọwọ.
The little boy and the girl went to town.	Ọmọkunrin kekere ati ọmọbirin naa lọ si ilu.
We became friends.	A di ọrẹ.
I do not know when it will appear.	Emi ko mọ igba ti o yoo han.
Do not let anyone have the key.	Ma ṣe jẹ ki ẹnikẹni ni bọtini.
You can sell their house or let them sell.	O le ta ile wọn tabi jẹ ki wọn jẹ ki wọn ta.
It is one foot.	Ẹsẹ kan ni.
The first thing is to spend more time outdoors.	Ohun akọkọ ni lati lo akoko diẹ sii ni ita.
I will not do anything wrong.	Mi o ṣe ohunkohun ti ko tọ.
I have to go.	Emi ni lati lọ.
They can be applied to it.	Wọn le ṣee lo si i.
Maybe he can't pick it up.	Boya ko le gbe e soke.
Always do your best.	Nigbagbogbo ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
Inside or outside.	Ninu tabi ita.
Buy it if possible.	Ra a lo ti o ba ṣeeṣe.
But it is still no news.	Sugbon o jẹ ṣi ko si iroyin.
They are the very reason we are.	Wọn jẹ idi pupọ ti a wa.
Everyone has access to that information.	Gbogbo eniyan ni anfani lati alaye yẹn.
We want to drink our bad tea.	A fẹ mu tii buburu wa.
We've had a lot of hands, for now.	A ti ni ọwọ pupọ, fun bayi.
That sounds good, but it's not great.	Iyẹn dara, ṣugbọn kii ṣe nla.
Neither the other.	Bẹni awọn miiran.
I do not know where the others went.	Emi ko mọ ibi ti awọn miiran lọ.
I have already been here.	Mo ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
And why not.	Ati idi ti ko.
The sister told me.	Arabinrin naa sọ fun mi.
We need the money.	A nilo owo naa.
Tell the group that you do not need any help.	Sọ fun ẹgbẹ pe ko nilo iranlọwọ eyikeyi.
There is also a cat position.	Ipo ologbo tun wa.
The street is filled with shops.	Opopona naa ti kun pẹlu awọn ile itaja.
It does not matter much.	Ko ṣe pataki pupọ.
I can not accept this anymore.	Emi ko le gba eyi mọ.
But it is not possible.	Sugbon ko le ṣee ṣe.
Do any of us.	Ṣe eyikeyi ninu wa.
So now let us do this.	Nitorina bayi jẹ ki a ṣe eyi.
He walked over to her.	O rin lori si rẹ.
Things are not good when you get home.	Ohun ko dara nigbati o de ile.
Their game only costs more.	Ere wọn nikan ni owo diẹ sii.
First, you have to find one.	Ni akọkọ, o ni lati wa ọkan.
Or if you change, it should be much smaller.	Tabi ti o ba yipada, o yẹ ki o kere pupọ.
Others are not anxious.	Awọn miiran ko ni aniyan.
I haven’t done that yet.	Emi ko ṣe iyẹn sibẹsibẹ.
In fact the prices were around three times that.	Ni o daju awọn owo wà ni ayika ni igba mẹta ti.
Look, just forget it.	Wo, kan gbagbe rẹ.
Doing a job for you.	Ṣiṣe iṣẹ kan fun ọ.
You get what you get.	O gba ohun ti o gba.
Maybe there is something you can see.	Boya ohun kan wa ti o le rii.
That also interests this type of work.	Iyẹn tun nifẹ si iru iṣẹ yii.
He looked up at the mountain for a long time.	O wo oke naa fun igba pipẹ.
They have killed themselves.	Wọn ti pa ara wọn.
Just do that if you have something to keep.	O kan ṣe iyẹn ti o ba ni nkan lati tọju.
This is easy.	Eyi rọrun.
If someone calls, say the right thing.	Ti ẹnikan ba pe, sọ ohun ti o tọ.
There are times when you do not believe in yourself.	Awọn igba kan wa ti ko gbagbọ funrararẹ.
At the very least, he just loves his company.	Ni pupọ julọ, o kan fẹran ile-iṣẹ rẹ.
Please, even if you do not remember it, try to.	Jọwọ, paapaa ti o ko ba ranti rẹ, gbiyanju lati.
This put us out for most of the summer.	Eleyi fi wa jade fun julọ ninu awọn ooru.
He thought of it when he got up.	O ro o nigbati o dide.
I lost my strength.	Agbara mi nu.
We have the same birthday.	A ni ojo ibi kanna.
It’s on your head here.	O wa lori ori rẹ nibi.
They look great.	Wọn dabi nla.
My parents met her and they loved her very much.	Awọn obi mi ti pade rẹ ati pe wọn fẹran rẹ pupọ.
I know people who need this.	Mo mọ awọn eniyan ti o nilo eyi.
It comes from all sides.	O wa lati gbogbo awọn ẹgbẹ.
You have no water.	O ko ni omi kankan.
I get some people scared.	Mo gba diẹ ninu awọn eniyan bẹru.
Money is not everything, you know.	Owo kii ṣe ohun gbogbo, o mọ.
Don't jump into conclusions!	Maṣe fo sinu awọn ipinnu!
The story has not changed or will last forever.	Itan naa ko yipada tabi yoo lailai.
I have seen someone.	Mo ti ri ẹnikan.
The doors open on the last car only.	Awọn ilẹkun ṣii lori ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o kẹhin nikan.
It's just happening.	O kan n ṣẹlẹ.
They think the world is what they stole.	Wọn ro pe aye ni ohun ti wọn ji.
There are two ways to do this.	Awọn ọna meji lo wa lati ṣe bẹ.
Wait for it.	Duro fun o.
With that, congratulations everyone.	Pẹlu iyẹn, e ku gbogbo eniyan.
We want the best for him.	A fẹ ohun ti o dara ju fun u.
Even this does not tell the whole story.	Paapaa eyi ko sọ gbogbo itan naa.
I’ve had my eye on this for a while.	Mo ti ni oju mi ​​lori eyi fun igba diẹ.
There is no body to recover.	Ko si ara lati gba pada.
They all have to come back.	Gbogbo wọn ni ki n pada wa.
And that's when he hit her.	Ati awọn ti o ni nigbati o lu u.
He obviously didn’t think it was working.	O han ni ko ro pe o n ṣiṣẹ.
The houses are nice.	Awọn ile dara.
But, this is not where the story ends.	Ṣugbọn, eyi kii ṣe ibi ti itan naa pari.
My how things changed.	Mi bawo ni nkan ṣe yipada.
You are here for a reason.	O wa nibi fun idi kan.
Let your sister do her job.	Jẹ ki arabinrin rẹ ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
Wondering who can give us trouble.	Iyalẹnu tani o le fun wa ni wahala.
Only that they did not lose money.	Nikan pe wọn ko padanu owo.
You do not have a last name.	O ko ni orukọ ti o kẹhin.
Let me know who is my friend and who is not.	Jẹ ki n mọ awọn ti o jẹ ọrẹ mi ati awọn ti kii ṣe.
You do not get.	O ko gba.
They know it can be wrong.	Wọn mọ pe o le jẹ aṣiṣe.
You can’t worry about me.	O ko le ṣe aniyan nipa mi.
He told me.	O sọ fun mi.
They are dead on their feet.	Wọn ti ku lori ẹsẹ wọn.
That word should exist.	Ọrọ yẹn yẹ ki o wa tẹlẹ.
But people don’t just travel from house to store.	Ṣugbọn awọn eniyan ko kan rin irin-ajo lati ile si ile itaja.
This year will probably be similar.	Odun yi yoo jasi jẹ iru.
You are my sister more.	Iwọ jẹ arabinrin mi diẹ sii.
This work requires a lot of travel.	Iṣẹ yii nilo ọpọlọpọ irin-ajo.
We walked a long way and it made them very tired.	A rin ọna pipẹ ati pe o rẹ wọn gidigidi.
They may not be good words.	Wọn le ma jẹ awọn ọrọ ti o dara.
When you look at this plane, it is amazing.	Nigbati o ba wo ọkọ ofurufu yii, o jẹ iyalẹnu.
This baby is here to stay.	Ọmọ yii wa nibi lati duro.
She wants to live with him forever.	O fe lati gbe pẹlu rẹ lailai.
He took active interest in this thought.	O si mu lọwọ anfani ni yi ronu.
He looked, saw nothing.	O wo, ko ri nkankan.
Just the amount they will give.	O kan iye ti wọn yoo fun.
That would be some of my favorites.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ diẹ ninu awọn ayanfẹ mi.
They are all similar.	Gbogbo wọn jẹ iru.
There are many rivers in this area.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn odo wa ni agbegbe yii.
They did nothing.	Wọn ko ṣe ohunkohun.
And we should want to keep it.	Ati pe o yẹ ki a fẹ lati tọju rẹ.
Before that they did not exist.	Ṣaaju pe wọn ko si tẹlẹ.
So we read the game there.	Nitorina a ti ka ere naa nibẹ.
However they all did great harm.	Sibẹsibẹ gbogbo wọn ṣe ipalara nla.
This is nothing like that.	Eyi kii ṣe ohunkohun bi iyẹn.
It was a game they always played, and both loved it.	O jẹ ere ti wọn ṣe nigbagbogbo, ati pe awọn mejeeji fẹran.
You don’t live on them.	O ko gbe lori wọn.
This time it is now.	Ni akoko yii ni bayi.
Man can not be anything he wants.	Eniyan ko le jẹ ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
I mean when you talk about.	Mo tumọ si nigbati o ba sọrọ nipa.
But we did.	Ṣugbọn a ṣe.
We have not drunk since.	A ko tii mu lati igba naa.
I turned to him.	Mo yipada si ọdọ rẹ.
Not completely.	Ko ni patapata.
Few come to one.	Diẹ wa si ọkan.
Every day, they get better.	Ni gbogbo ọjọ, wọn dara diẹ sii.
I just do not know how to do this.	Mo kan ko mọ bi mo ṣe le ṣe eyi.
No one gave a name about his surname.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o fun ni kan nipa orukọ idile rẹ.
Every year, work, work.	Ni gbogbo ọdun, ṣiṣẹ, ṣiṣẹ.
Not you.	Kii ṣe iwọ.
I want you to think about it.	Mo fẹ ki o ronu nipa rẹ.
Someone has to tell the truth about what happened.	Ẹnikan ni lati sọ otitọ nipa ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
This time may be.	Akoko yi le.
She is the only child.	O jẹ ọmọ nikan.
At some point, this is not surprising.	Ni aaye kan, eyi kii ṣe iyalẹnu.
He is waiting for the bus that did not arrive.	O n duro de ọkọ akero ti ko de.
He has never been in love.	O ti ko ni ifẹ.
His eyes widened.	Oju rẹ duro.
They say they don’t have one.	Wọn sọ pe wọn ko ni ọkan.
He took my hand and kissed my head.	O mu owo mi o si fi ẹnu ko ori mi.
Get it for the right thing.	Gba fun ohun ti o tọ.
For a few minutes, nothing happened.	Fun iṣẹju diẹ, ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
We will do the best we can.	A yoo ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ ti a le.
I will not go back like that.	Emi kii yoo pada sẹhin bẹ.
That's why you can't see much.	Ti o ni idi ti o ko le ri Elo.
She sounds sorry for herself.	O dun binu fun ara rẹ.
Look at me.	Wo mi.
Before leaving the room.	Ṣaaju ki o to kuro ni yara naa.
I came out right.	Mo wa jade ti o tọ.
How many of us are dead?	Bawo ni ọpọlọpọ ninu wa ni o ku?
What do you think about that game?	Kini o ro nipa ere yẹn?
He kept his mouth shut.	O pa ẹnu rẹ mọ.
I swam back to it and looked at the dog.	Mo we pada si o ati ki o wo ni aja.
This is also happening.	Eyi tun n ṣẹlẹ.
It's not that he didn't go.	Kii ṣe pe oun ko lo si.
I see a lot of his stuff growing up.	Mo wo ọpọlọpọ nkan rẹ ti o dagba.
By the time he was home, he had learned to ask.	Ni igba diẹ ti o ti wa ni ile, o ti kọ ẹkọ lati beere.
It looks like a big plan.	O dabi eto nla kan.
It was out of his sight.	O ti jade kuro ni oju rẹ.
Do not marry.	Maṣe ṣe igbeyawo.
Maybe that’s not what you decided.	Boya iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti o pinnu.
Let him continue with his speech.	Jẹ ki o tẹsiwaju pẹlu ọrọ rẹ.
They’ve talked about the thing.	Wọn ti sọ nipa ohun naa.
This could be for three reasons.	Eyi le jẹ nitori awọn idi mẹta.
I know it won't work.	Mo mọ pe kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
Do not bring this letter to the office.	Maṣe mu lẹta yii wa si ọfiisi.
To begin with, nothing appears.	Lati bẹrẹ pẹlu, ko si ohun ti o han.
I have some great ideas for things to change in my book.	Mo ni diẹ ninu awọn imọran nla fun awọn nkan lati yipada ninu iwe mi.
You have a lot of questions, do you?	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere, ṣe iwọ?
Not much anymore.	Ko Elo mọ.
Others do not want to see the picture.	Awọn miiran ko fẹ lati wo aworan naa.
You can, you understand.	O le, o loye.
Of course he loves we need.	Dajudaju o nifẹ a nilo.
It will not do.	O yoo ko ṣe.
They did not see the harm they did.	Wọn ko ri ipalara ti wọn ṣe.
I have those.	Mo ni awon.
You cannot get them out of your mind.	O ko le gba wọn kuro ninu ọkan rẹ.
Please can anyone help me get this.	Jọwọ ṣe ẹnikẹni le ran mi lọwọ lati gba eyi.
Even you can not take away from the test.	Paapaa o ko le ya kuro ni oju idanwo.
I seem to have a lot to say.	Mo dabi ẹni pe o ni pupọ lati sọ.
They will have to walk.	Wọn yoo ni lati rin.
He made his own stories.	O ṣe awọn itan tirẹ.
They are not possible.	Wọn ko ṣee ṣe.
You can’t be angry with me about this.	O ko le binu si mi nipa eyi.
I will leave after my work is over.	Emi yoo lọ kuro lẹhin iṣẹ mi ti pari.
All is not well.	Gbogbo ko dara.
The reasons are as follows.	Awọn idi ni bi wọnyi.
I can see that that may help some students.	Mo le rii pe iyẹn le ṣe iranlọwọ fun diẹ ninu awọn ọmọ ile-iwe.
In the same area.	Ni agbegbe kanna.
But no sweet feet.	Sugbon ko si dun ẹsẹ.
His eyes were the same.	Oju rẹ si wà kanna.
So, he decided to divorce her.	Nitorina, o pinnu lati kọ ọ silẹ.
What you get from it.	Ohun ti o gba lọwọ rẹ.
You are not eligible for the service.	O ko yẹ fun iṣẹ naa.
Try and carry out, and you will find nothing.	Gbiyanju ati gbe jade, ati awọn ti o yoo ri ohunkohun.
Notice more in your speech.	Ṣe akiyesi diẹ sii ninu ọrọ rẹ.
I hope it is good for you too.	Mo nireti pe o dara fun ọ paapaa.
Let's go inside.	Jẹ ki a lọ sinu.
The system is alive and well.	Eto wa laaye ati dagba.
The story will be the same.	Itan naa yoo jẹ kanna.
Stay with us for it.	Duro pẹlu wa fun o.
The song sounds good.	Orin naa dun.
And we had a good time.	Ati pe a ni akoko ti o dara.
But there is a problem with that.	Ṣugbọn iṣoro kan wa pẹlu iyẹn.
He sat at my table.	O joko ni tabili mi.
It's long, but not long enough.	O gun, sugbon ko gun to.
I'll leave it to you.	Emi yoo fi silẹ fun ọ.
They heard the song.	Wọn gbọ orin naa.
We just love to tell us what to do.	A o kan nifẹ lati sọ fun wa kini lati ṣe.
Think about all the things you can do.	Ronu nipa gbogbo ohun ti o le ṣe.
We do not know.	A ko mọ.
Look at that activity.	Wo iṣẹ ṣiṣe yẹn.
It’s the last thing on football.	O jẹ ohun ti o kẹhin lori bọọlu.
If the children do from home, you have won them.	Ti awọn ọmọ ba ṣe lati ile, o ti gba wọn.
I think this method will work.	Mo ro pe ọna yii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
People are also swimming in the beaches.	Awọn eniyan tun wa ni odo ni awọn eti okun.
You are both happy.	Inu yin mejeeji dun.
It is not an impossible task.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ ti ko ṣeeṣe.
Nothing more anything less.	Ko si ohun diẹ sii ohunkohun kere.
If not you can try one now.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ o le gbiyanju ọkan ni bayi.
But that is not the case.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe iyẹn.
So we went up there.	Nitorina a lọ soke nibẹ.
It comes in small pockets inside the shoe box.	O wa ninu awọn apo kekere inu apoti bata.
They look good in the front.	Wọn wo daradara ni iwaju.
The word is near my heart.	Ọrọ naa wa nitosi ọkan mi.
You never heard of a car.	O ko gbọ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
There is a tree in this box.	Igi kan wa ninu apoti yii.
But that is what they did.	Ṣugbọn ohun ti wọn ṣe niyẹn.
The whole town came out to hear me.	Gbogbo ilu wa jade lati gbọ mi.
I saw in it.	Mo ti ri ninu rẹ.
People, the streets in particular, can never understand.	Awọn eniyan, awọn ita ni pataki, ko le loye rara.
Can't get it.	Ko le gba.
It has enough room for students to eat.	O ni yara ti o to fun awọn ọmọ ile-iwe lati jẹun.
And if it is, they will call back.	Ati pe ti o ba jẹ, wọn yoo pe pada.
You have hurt your child.	O ti ṣe ọmọ rẹ ni ipalara.
You are not good.	O ko ba dara.
The car crossed the fireplace.	Ọkọ naa kọja ile ina.
What do you call.	Kini o pe.
She went to her room.	O lọ si yara rẹ.
They go to good schools.	Wọn lọ si awọn ile-iwe ti o dara.
And this is something that everyone can feel good about.	Ati pe eyi ni ohun kan ti gbogbo eniyan le ni rilara ti o dara nipa.
And make some money.	Ki o si ṣe diẹ ninu awọn owo.
Like this time a lot.	Bi ti akoko yii pupọ.
That is the kind of space he gives us.	Iru aaye ti o fun wa niyẹn.
That is of course what is happening here.	Iyẹn dajudaju ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ nibi.
You do not know.	O ko mọ.
I wrote down all my words.	Mo kọ gbogbo ọrọ mi silẹ.
Times have changed.	Awọn akoko ti yipada.
Just a minute.	O kan iṣẹju kan.
It just has no power.	O kan ko ni agbara.
They may want to feel it.	Wọn le fẹ fun rilara rẹ.
The men searched the house.	Awọn ọkunrin naa wa ile naa.
He will need your strength.	Oun yoo nilo agbara rẹ.
All men can do is sit there and wait.	Gbogbo ohun ti awọn ọkunrin le ṣe ni joko nibẹ ati duro.
He took this which was very important to me.	O mu eyi ti o ṣe pataki fun mi.
There is something.	Ohun kan wà.
I will miss you.	Emi yoo padanu rẹ.
You may know.	O le mọ.
You don’t even feel it.	O ko paapaa lero rẹ.
This is the person who needs to make this song.	Eyi ni eniyan ti o nilo lati ṣe orin yii.
He left the letter for me.	O fi lẹta naa silẹ fun mi.
Not your site.	Ko ṣe aaye rẹ.
Winter course is coming.	Igba otutu dajudaju n bọ.
We need to do something.	A nilo lati se nkankan.
Her son wants to see his mother.	Ọmọkunrin rẹ fẹ akiyesi iya rẹ.
It makes me tired.	O rẹ mi.
It is located in the local center.	O wa ni ile-iṣẹ agbegbe.
No, there must be other information.	Rara, alaye miiran gbọdọ wa.
He, however, declined to say when.	Oun, sibẹsibẹ, kọ lati sọ nigbawo.
To find out more, see Here.	Lati wa diẹ sii, wo Nibi.
Money is an amazing commodity.	Owo jẹ ohun elo iyanu.
I think you want to get back.	Mo ro pe o fẹ lati gba pada.
He refuses to eat or drink.	O kọ lati jẹ tabi mu.
Your work is important.	Iṣẹ rẹ ṣe pataki.
I know my hair.	Mo mọ irun mi.
Stand.	Duro.
But obviously, it has arrived.	Sugbon o han ni, o ti de.
He is walking home.	O n rin ile.
He came to me.	O wa si ọdọ mi.
I am well into urban life.	Mo wa daradara si igbesi aye ilu.
I have something else for him.	Mo ni nkan miiran fun u.
, a bi.	, a bi.
I want to see you.	Mo fe ri e.
Okay, don't look any further.	O dara, maṣe wo mọ.
I can believe that.	Mo le gbagbọ pe.
The machines have outdated some of the functions.	Awọn ẹrọ ti sọ diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ di igba atijọ.
I have already told him.	Mo ti sọ tẹlẹ fun u.
The books available in this area are numerous.	Awọn iwe ti o wa ni agbegbe yii jẹ pupọ.
You get to repair your car.	O gba lati tun ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ ṣe.
Alternatively, of course, but it will come back.	Ni ọna miiran, dajudaju, ṣugbọn o yoo pada.
You have to understand a lot more than that.	O ni lati ni oye pupọ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
I have not been good in those areas.	Emi ko ti dara ni awọn agbegbe yẹn.
They have so many great songs.	Won ni ki ọpọlọpọ awọn nla awọn orin.
It can only be better from here.	O le dara julọ lati ibi nikan.
There are so many interesting things about it.	Nibẹ ni o wa ki ọpọlọpọ awọn awon ohun nipa o.
Neither here nor there.	Bẹni nibi tabi nibẹ.
Lower your head.	Gbe ori rẹ silẹ.
Make sure you drain the water well.	Rii daju pe o sọ omi kuro daradara.
He took something that I will not try to kill.	O mu nkan ti emi o gbiyanju lati pa a.
Obviously, they are not.	O han ni, wọn kii ṣe.
That was the only time.	Iyẹn nikan ni akoko.
This is the main driver of the project.	Eyi jẹ awakọ akọkọ ti iṣẹ.
He does not want to tell anyone.	Ko fe so fun enikeni.
That seems like you love them.	Iyẹn dabi ẹni pe o nifẹ wọn.
Just move on and let it live.	O kan gbe ki o jẹ ki o gbe laaye.
What is important to me may or may not be important to you.	Ohun ti o ṣe pataki si mi le tabi ko le ṣe pataki si ọ.
Lift up through the top of your head.	Gbe soke nipasẹ awọn oke ti ori rẹ.
And to beat him.	Ati lati lu u.
Some want a hand which will help them up.	Awọn fẹ a ọwọ eyi ti yoo ran wọn soke.
I was fun.	Mo ti wà fun.
And that happened here.	Ati pe iyẹn ṣẹlẹ nibi.
It was a really great game.	O jẹ ere nla gaan.
I made your son about it.	Mo ṣe ọmọ rẹ nipa rẹ.
And never speak to them again.	Ati ki o ko sọrọ si wọn lẹẹkansi.
You don’t have to have anything to do with them.	O ko ni lati ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu wọn.
Give it a go.	Fun o kan lọ.
I have not woken up yet.	Emi ko ji sibẹsibẹ.
What it is, is still there.	Kini o jẹ, ṣi wa.
How sweet that would have been.	Bawo ni iyẹn yoo ti dun to.
I asked to.	Mo ti beere lati.
He loves women.	O nifẹ awọn obinrin.
Anyone who understands will.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ni oye yoo.
They drink.	Won mu.
Students must learn important values.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe gbọdọ kọ ẹkọ awọn iye pataki.
We know where they got from.	A mọ ibi ti wọn ti gba lati.
My friend is a great help.	Ọrẹ mi jẹ iranlọwọ nla.
I have never been here before.	Emi ko ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
Not like me.	Ko dabi emi.
Now it's time to act.	Bayi o to akoko lati ṣe.
They tell each other that they love each other.	Wọn sọ fun ara wọn pe wọn nifẹ ara wọn.
We are doing the story.	A n ṣe itan naa.
It sounds beautiful.	O ni ohun lẹwa.
Repeat your question.	Tun ibeere rẹ kọ.
By law, it allows you to walk by sea.	Nipa ofin, o gba ọ laaye lati rin nipasẹ okun.
And he says he's still here.	Ati pe o sọ pe o tun wa nibi.
His hand was down.	Ọwọ rẹ ti lọ silẹ.
You know the way out of this place.	O mọ ọna jade ni ibi yii.
But he came to see.	Ṣugbọn o wa lati rii.
Their work has helped everyone to have more value.	Iṣẹ wọn ti ṣe iranlọwọ fun gbogbo eniyan lati ni iye diẹ sii.
I can't say how we met.	Emi ko le sọ bi a ṣe pade.
I have a sister and a mother.	Mo ni arabinrin ati iya kan.
That sounds really good.	Ti o dun gan ti o dara.
It is the only way.	O jẹ ọna nikan ni.
Her cat seemed happy.	Ologbo rẹ dabi enipe o dun.
I want you to think about my question really.	Mo fẹ ki o ronu nipa ibeere mi gaan.
You just need to eat it.	O kan nilo lati jẹ ọ.
This word has been around for a long time.	Ọrọ yii ti wa fun igba pipẹ.
This does not seem to be the case.	Eyi ko dabi paapaa.
They are in a difficult situation.	Wọn wa ni ipo ti o nira.
Do not put your name on it.	Maṣe fi orukọ rẹ si i.
I do not accept it.	Emi ko gba rẹ.
Time is of the essence here.	Akoko jẹ pataki nibi.
The money didn’t matter to him.	Owo naa ko ṣe pataki fun u.
I am taking a lot of time.	Mo n gba akoko pupọ julọ.
That was the last few days.	Ti jẹ awọn ọjọ diẹ ti o kẹhin.
When you talk to him just tell him to keep his mouth shut.	Nigbati o ba sọrọ pẹlu rẹ o kan sọ fun ọ pe ki o pa ẹnu rẹ mọ.
Ko pade.	Ko pade.
They bathed on the beach.	Wọn wẹ lori eti okun.
Forget any of this ever happening.	Gbagbe eyikeyi ninu eyi lailai ṣẹlẹ.
He was the bad guy.	O jẹ ọmọkunrin buburu naa.
And inside, was this book.	Ati inu, wà iwe yi.
At that time he said little.	Ni akoko yẹn o sọ diẹ.
And maybe no one should tell you what to think.	Ati boya ko si ọkan yẹ ki o so fun o ohun ti lati ro.
I am not dead yet.	Emi ko tii ku sibẹsibẹ.
I want this to work for our little ones.	Mo fẹ ki eyi ṣiṣẹ fun awọn ọmọ kekere wa.
I remember hearing that already.	Mo ranti gbọ pe tẹlẹ.
And you will spend more because you will need more.	Ati pe iwọ yoo lo diẹ nitori iwọ yoo nilo diẹ.
You can not, of course, do this.	O ko le, dajudaju, ṣe eyi.
Add the bread.	Fi akara naa kun.
This will hurt.	Eyi yoo ṣe ipalara.
Two other children died young.	Awọn ọmọde meji miiran ti ku ni ọdọ.
We beat them.	A lu wọn.
It has already been done.	O ti ṣe tẹlẹ.
Love always needs more.	Ifẹ nigbagbogbo nilo diẹ sii.
So it comes from love.	Nitorina o wa lati ibi ifẹ.
It is such.	O jẹ iru bẹ.
I do not like your tone.	Emi ko fẹran ohun orin rẹ.
No, it will take place.	Rara, yoo gba aye.
I have a big car.	Mo ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ nla kan.
Without water we cannot live long.	Laisi omi a ko le gbe gun.
I don’t know who that might be.	Emi ko mọ ẹni ti iyẹn le jẹ.
But that does not mean anything.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko tumọ si ohunkohun.
We will leave tonight to remember.	A yoo fi alẹ lati ranti.
It is only one thing.	O jẹ nkan ọkan nikan.
They will see you for what it is.	Wọn yoo rii ọ fun ohun ti o jẹ.
But the future.	Ṣugbọn ojo iwaju.
He has no trouble with it.	Ko ni wahala pẹlu rẹ.
I did not try it in my device.	Emi ko gbiyanju o ni mi ẹrọ.
You got the wrong seat.	O ti gba ijoko ti ko tọ.
I do not know how to do that.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe iyẹn.
I have never met this person in my life.	Emi ko tii pade eniyan yii ni igbesi aye mi.
They are spending the night with friends.	Wọn ti wa ni alẹ pẹlu awọn ọrẹ.
I find your story bad and, frankly, impossible to believe.	Mo rii itan rẹ ti ko dara ati, ni otitọ, ko ṣee ṣe lati gbagbọ.
We want them to be as simple as possible.	A fẹ ki wọn rọrun bi o ti ṣee.
She is planning to write a book.	O n gbero lati kọ iwe kan.
You can get my company.	O le gba ile-iṣẹ mi.
But people are in and out of some.	Ṣugbọn awọn eniyan wa ninu ati jade diẹ ninu.
None of it.	Ko si ọkan rẹ.
Make sure they have breakfast.	Rii daju pe wọn jẹ ounjẹ owurọ.
He does not have any of this.	Oun ko ni eyikeyi ninu eyi.
On the way, he would find a meeting he would go to.	Ni opopona, oun yoo wa ipade kan yoo lọ.
Room growing hot.	Yara dagba gbona.
That is not the case.	Iyẹn ko jẹ.
I mean, how nice.	Mo tumọ si, bi o ṣe dara.
And we would have kept it on that thought.	Ati pe a yoo ti pa a mọ lori ero naa.
Or even a month.	Tabi paapaa oṣu kan.
In your hand.	Ni ọwọ rẹ.
You can add the number of trees you want.	O le fi iye awọn igi ti o fẹ.
You need the service.	O nilo iṣẹ naa.
Give yourself strength.	Fun ara rẹ ni agbara.
Two things about this.	Nkan meji nipa eyi.
Celebrations are there.	Awọn ayẹyẹ wa nibẹ.
I think it can be, but it is not.	Mo ro pe o le le, ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ.
Not at all.	Ko wa rara.
He has been removed from his position.	O ti yọ kuro ni ipo rẹ.
I will write more about those ideas in the coming weeks.	Emi yoo kọ diẹ sii nipa awọn ero yẹn ni awọn ọsẹ to n bọ.
This sounds pretty fun.	Eleyi dun lẹwa fun.
Works well in many applications.	Ṣiṣẹ daradara ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun elo.
He does not know how.	Ko mọ bi o ṣe ṣe.
They will not really go down.	Wọn kii yoo lọ silẹ gaan.
Try to explain as much as possible.	Gbiyanju lati ṣe alaye bi o ti ṣee.
We have never thought about that.	A ti ko ro ero lori wipe.
She knew he loved her.	O mọ pe o nifẹ rẹ.
But there is nothing to do about it right now.	Ṣugbọn ko si nkankan lati ṣe nipa rẹ ni bayi.
And ask questions.	Ati beere ibeere.
He did not move.	Ko gbe.
Obviously, you do not need to use.	O han ni, o ko nilo lati lo.
I can help.	Mo le ran.
Some of the men were like it.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti awọn ọkunrin wà bi o.
You are not afraid to go out alone.	O ko bẹru lati jade nikan.
The player agrees to do so.	Ẹrọ orin gba pe ṣe.
After everyone else went to bed.	Lẹhin ti gbogbo eniyan miiran lọ si ibusun.
You are better than me.	O dara ju mi ​​lọ.
But don’t make the same mistake and lose again.	Ṣugbọn maṣe ṣe aṣiṣe kanna ki o padanu lẹẹkansi.
They would say, of your father.	Wọn yoo sọ pe, ti baba rẹ.
I do not think much of it.	Emi ko ro Elo ti o.
Get a book and try not to worry.	Gba iwe ki o gbiyanju lati ma ṣe aniyan.
We have to boot the thing.	A ni lati bata nkan naa.
He would have to leave there.	Oun yoo ni lati fi silẹ nibẹ.
And this is only possible because we are that body.	Ati pe eyi ṣee ṣe nikan nitori pe a jẹ ara yẹn.
I can't tell you anymore.	Nko le so fun mo.
In the summer, they will usually work on only one machine.	Ni akoko ooru, wọn yoo maa ṣiṣẹ lori ẹrọ kan nikan.
You can talk to the police.	O le sọrọ si ọlọpa.
You can see on the picture below.	O le wo lori aworan ni isalẹ.
Don't worry about anything.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan nipa ohunkohun.
And tell stories.	Ati sọ awọn itan.
Remember he was a little boy.	Ranti pe ọmọkunrin kekere ni.
That is starting to change.	Iyẹn bẹrẹ lati yipada.
He disappeared into a group room and hurried back.	O padanu sinu yara ẹgbẹ kan o si yara pada.
There is nothing wrong with your look.	Ko si ohun ti o jẹ aṣiṣe pẹlu oju rẹ.
However, the cars did not stop.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ko duro.
They are called rivers.	Odo ni won n pe won.
I never thought of shoes.	Emi ko ro bata rara.
Here are a few more tips.	Eyi ni awọn imọran diẹ diẹ sii.
Thoughts cannot work in any place other than time.	Ero ko le ṣiṣẹ ni eyikeyi aaye miiran ju ti akoko.
I'm not too scared.	Emi ko bẹru pupọ.
So it’s not that big of a deal.	Nitorina kii ṣe pe nla ti adehun kan.
This is incorrect.	Eyi ko tọ.
We do not need anyone to believe in us.	A ko nilo ẹnikẹni lati gbagbọ ninu wa.
And it's not over.	Ati pe ko pari.
But that doesn’t mean we can’t see.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko tumọ si pe a ko le rii.
I should not be surprised.	Emi ko yẹ ki o ṣe iyalẹnu.
Because we have.	Nitori a ni.
It looks good in the field.	O wo dara ni aaye.
But none of that.	Ṣugbọn ko si ọkan ninu iyẹn.
The water is hot.	Omi naa n gbona.
You take care of it, no matter what happens.	O tọju rẹ, ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
He drove into the city.	O wakọ sinu ilu naa.
As impossible as it seems, it is true.	Bi o ṣe dabi pe ko ṣeeṣe, otitọ ni.
It's just great.	O kan jẹ nla.
Their marriage ended before it began.	Igbeyawo wọn pari ṣaaju ki o to bẹrẹ.
I work all the time.	Mo ṣiṣẹ ni gbogbo igba.
You have found your site.	O ti ri aaye rẹ.
Not by law.	Ko nipa ofin.
It didn't go well.	Ko lọ daradara.
It would be nice if you could, but it's not.	Yoo dara ti o ba ṣe, ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ.
So, there you have it, out in the open.	Nitorina, nibẹ o wa, jade ni gbangba.
I don’t want to have a man in my life.	Emi ko nifẹ lati ni ọkunrin ni igbesi aye mi.
I hope the book improves.	Mo nireti pe iwe naa dara si.
You can let them go beyond it.	O le jẹ ki wọn lọ kọja rẹ.
There are a few ways you can go about this.	Awọn ọna diẹ wa ti o le lọ nipa eyi.
Use the things we need to try to stop us.	Lo awọn nkan ti a nilo lati gbiyanju lati da wa duro.
My money is stolen!	Owo mi ti ji!
But you want more than that.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
Just look and remember.	Kan wo ki o ranti.
Can't find it.	A ko le rii.
It means well by me, it means well by you.	O tumọ si daradara nipasẹ mi, o tumọ si daradara nipasẹ rẹ.
No one knew we were there.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ pe a ti wa nibẹ.
He seemed to know he was doing something wrong.	O dabi pe o mọ pe o ṣe ohun ti ko tọ.
Two of my children died.	Meji ninu awọn ọmọ mi ku.
He slept for several hours.	O sun fun ọpọlọpọ awọn wakati.
He let nothing pass.	Ko jẹ ki ohunkohun kọja.
Tomorrow is your birthday.	Ọla ni ọjọ ibi rẹ.
Let’s start with the store itself.	Jẹ ki a bẹrẹ pẹlu ile itaja funrararẹ.
Now you can not just walk away.	Bayi ko le kan rin kuro.
If you can look inside one person?	Ti o ba le wo inu ọkan eniyan?
This should not come as a surprise.	Eyi ko yẹ ki o wa bi iyalẹnu.
Please try again in a few minutes.	Jọwọ gbiyanju lẹẹkansi ni iṣẹju diẹ.
Think about how long it took.	Ronu bi o ti pẹ to.
Nothing happened.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It is beyond them.	O ju won.
You need a lot of water or this tea.	O nilo omi pupọ tabi tii yii.
They did not find anything, they returned to the field.	Wọn ko ri nkankan, wọn pada si aaye.

There is no space on this.	Ko si aaye lori eyi.
It comes from outside.	O wa lati ita.
Written by yourself.	Ti a kọ nipa ara rẹ.
I want to change that.	Mo fẹ yi iyẹn pada.
There are two main reasons for this.	Awọn idi pataki meji ni o wa fun eyi.
I do not want anything anymore.	Emi ko fẹ nkankan mọ gaan.
This can take several hours.	Eyi le gba awọn wakati pupọ.
You only remember the names.	O ranti awọn orukọ nikan.
It is still there.	O tun wa.
Almost everyone out there.	O fẹrẹ ju gbogbo eniyan jade.

Thoughts carried his bags.	Awọn ero ti gbe awọn apo rẹ.
Wash your hands, and your face.	Wẹ ọwọ rẹ, ati oju rẹ.
But do your best.	Ṣugbọn ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
There are times when these people look at you.	O jẹ awọn akoko bii awọn eniyan yii n wo si ọ.
It should go of course.	O yẹ ki o lọ dajudaju.
It is always true.	O jẹ otitọ nigbagbogbo.
Your members know what you believe.	Awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ rẹ mọ ohun ti o gbagbọ.
It was raining last night.	Ojo ti n ro ni alẹ ana.
Nothing makes it worthwhile.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣe ti o ni iye.
And for a while it worked.	Ati fun akoko kan o ṣiṣẹ.
We could have done this by ourselves.	A le ti ṣe eyi nipasẹ ara wa.
Never miss a meal.	Maṣe padanu ounjẹ rara.
And so the thing continues.	Ati bẹ nkan naa n tẹsiwaju.

Everything is nothing.	Ohun gbogbo ko jẹ nkankan.

But we will go through this together.	Ṣugbọn a yoo lọ nipasẹ eyi papọ.
I speak and write for them.	Mo sọ ati kọ fun wọn.
That's when we hit.	Ti o ni nigbati a lu.
Not sure what to do with that fact.	Ko daju kini lati ṣe pẹlu otitọ yẹn.
Nor is it in fact their game plan.	Tabi ni o daju pe won ere eto.
It is intended for you, and for me.	O ti pinnu fun ọ, ati fun mi.
But that is a personal opinion.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ ero ti ara ẹni.
I do not always agree so when is the best time.	Emi ko gba nigbagbogbo nitorina nigbawo ni akoko ti o dara julọ.
He really loves you.	Nifẹ rẹ gaan.
You don’t have time to ask, however.	O ko ni akoko lati beere, sibẹsibẹ.
It is easy to say so.	O rọrun lati sọrọ bẹ.
Both need this, you know.	Awọn mejeeji nilo eyi, o mọ.
Until my office, but did nothing.	Titi di ọfiisi mi, ṣugbọn ko ṣe nkankan.
I found out about that about a week ago.	Mo ti rii nipa iyẹn bii ọsẹ kan sẹhin.
He decided because it was his dog.	O pinnu nitori pe o jẹ aja rẹ.
She came out for a walk.	O wa jade fun rin.

I am always in trouble.	Mo wa ninu wahala nigbagbogbo.
You must make sure you find your way home again.	O gbọdọ rii daju pe o wa ọna rẹ si ile lẹẹkansi.
Lots of great things.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun nla.
In fact, many, many times.	Ni otitọ, ọpọlọpọ, ọpọlọpọ igba.
I'm going to go one at a time.	Mo n sọ lọ ọkan ni akoko kan.
I am planning to buy this phone.	Mo n gbero lati ra foonu yii.
You need to process it.	O nilo lati lọwọ rẹ.
Think you are dead if you have to.	Ronu pe o ti ku bi o ba ni lati.
So that is amazing.	Nitorina iyẹn jẹ iyanu.
Like his father, he thought.	Bi baba rẹ, o ro.
The man has done it too.	Ọkunrin naa ti ṣe o ju.
The woman is not so.	Obinrin naa kii ṣe bẹ.
Please show proper respect.	Jọwọ fi ọwọ ti o yẹ han.
Do this legally.	Ṣe eyi ni ofin.
Soon they realized it could not.	Laipẹ wọn rii pe ko le.
If it sounds, just do it.	Ti o ba dun, o kan ṣe.
What are your benefits?	Kini awọn anfani rẹ?
I tried first.	Mo gbiyanju akọkọ.
There are other accounts of this story.	Awọn iroyin miiran ti itan yii wa.
I almost said the same thing about it.	Mo ti fẹrẹ sọ ohun kanna nipa rẹ.
Decide to do some of it.	Pinnu lati ṣe diẹ ninu rẹ.
Few expect it to be as high as it was this year.	Diẹ ni o nireti pe ki o ga bi o ti jẹ ni ọdun yii.
I mean specifically.	Mo tumọ si ni pataki.
Don't worry too much about it.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan pupọ nipa rẹ.
Not in a bad way.	Kii ṣe ni ọna buburu.
Other things should end first.	Awọn ohun miiran yẹ ki o pari ni akọkọ.
Things you must know.	Awọn nkan ti o gbọdọ mọ.
He talks into his phone.	O sọrọ sinu foonu rẹ.
There are some words that do not say.	Awọn ọrọ kan wa ti ko sọ.
I asked him why he did this.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ idi ti o fi ṣe eyi.
Not for the moment.	Kii ṣe fun akoko naa.
I am very happy to be back.	Inu mi dun pupọ lati pada wa.
It was summer before her mother died.	Igba ooru niyẹn ṣaaju ki iya rẹ to ku.

There are several things you can do.	Awọn nkan pupọ lo wa ti o le ṣe.
Would you like some tea?	Ṣe o fẹ tii diẹ?
About me, he said.	Nipa mi, o sọ.
It will just happen more.	O kan yoo ṣẹlẹ diẹ sii.
I can't beat him.	Nko le lu u.
No one paid much attention.	Ko si ọkan san Elo akiyesi.
It does not matter to the story.	Ko ṣe pataki si itan naa.
However, it was his decision.	Sibẹsibẹ, o jẹ ipinnu rẹ.
Let us make this agreement.	Jẹ ki a ṣe adehun yii.
They did not enjoy it very much.	Wọn ko gbadun rẹ pupọ.
I can not see why anyone would do this.	Emi ko le rii idi ti ẹnikẹni yoo ṣe eyi.
Sometimes, in the right conditions, you can.	Nigba miiran, ni awọn ipo ti o tọ, o le.
It's time to dump her and move on.	O to akoko ti o pinnu lati pada.
Of course this will come as a surprise to them.	Dajudaju eyi yoo jẹ iyalẹnu fun wọn.
A work accident ended his life.	Ijamba iṣẹ kan pari aye rẹ.
Members will leave questions about that.	Ọmọ ẹgbẹ yoo fi ibeere silẹ nipa iyẹn.
We do not accept.	A ko gba.
You have already seen.	O ti rii tẹlẹ.
I look back out of the closet a lot.	Mo wo pada jade ninu awọn pa pupo.
Come into another room.	Wa sinu yara miiran.
Let it reach you.	Jẹ ki o de ọdọ rẹ.
He doesn't like me.	Ko feran mi.
They did well for themselves at that time.	Wọn ṣe daradara fun ara wọn ni akoko yẹn.
A trip takes several hours.	Irin-ajo kan gba to awọn wakati pupọ.
I do not feel so.	Emi ko lero bẹ.
The door to your room is locked.	Ilẹkun yara tirẹ ko tii.
Let's repeat it again.	Jẹ ká tun ti o lẹẹkansi.
People always forget about this.	Awọn eniyan nigbagbogbo gbagbe nipa eyi.
That will take time.	Iyẹn yoo gba akoko.
This is because they will carry the same system.	Eyi jẹ nitori pe wọn yoo gbe eto kanna.
I am happy.	Inu mi dun.
Will you.	Ṣe iwọ yoo.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?	Ṣe o ni awọn arakunrin tabi arabinrin?
When we die, we die.	Nigba ti a ba ku, a ku.
You may not realize it is impossible.	O ko le mọ pe ko ṣee ṣe.
Please make sure it never reaches me.	Jọwọ rii daju pe ko de ọdọ mi rara.
He has no problems.	Ko ni awọn iṣoro.
They get very, very good.	Wọn gba pupọ, daradara pupọ.
Which you must remove with your own hands.	Eyi ti o gbọdọ yọ pẹlu ọwọ ara rẹ.
They have no time for this.	Wọn ko ni akoko fun eyi.
They come to get women.	Wọn wa lati gba awọn obinrin.
He knew he had made a big mistake.	O mọ pe o ti ṣe aṣiṣe nla kan.
There is nothing you can not have.	Ko si ohun ti o ko ba le ni.
She sat on the bed.	O joko lori ibusun.
No one will stop and help you.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo da duro ati ran ọ lọwọ.
Do not look the other way.	Maṣe wo ọna miiran.
One person.	Eniyan kan.
You can not leave us.	O ko le fi wa silẹ.
Such people are everywhere.	Iru eniyan wa nibi gbogbo.
That is of course, if you can sleep.	Iyẹn jẹ dajudaju, ti o ba le sun oorun.
The word to others.	Ọrọ naa si awọn miiran.
You need rest.	O nilo isinmi.
But it’s not about it.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe nipa rẹ.
Continuing rain has filled the house.	Ojo ti n tẹsiwaju ti jẹ ki ile kun.
He repeated the question.	O tun ibeere naa tun.
When they get here, you will die.	Nigbati wọn ba de ibi, iwọ yoo ku.
We can give a name to such request details.	A le fun orukọ kan si iru awọn alaye ibeere.
I gave it to my husband.	Mo ti fi fun ọkọ mi.
Complete the fields.	Pari awọn aaye.
By going.	Nipasẹ lilọ.
He looked at my face.	O wo oju mi.
We have gone through such things.	A ti kọja iru awọn nkan bẹẹ.
Maybe even women.	Boya paapaa awọn obinrin.
He seemed to need me.	O dabi enipe o nilo mi.
Companies are always near the rivers.	Awọn ile-iṣẹ nigbagbogbo wa nitosi awọn odo.
I'm not angry.	Nko ka iwe naa.
But this is very much even for him.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ pupọ paapaa fun u.
I want to talk about something else.	Mo fẹ lati sọrọ nipa nkan miiran.
He touched one and turned and walked away.	O fi ọwọ kan ọkan o si yipada o si lọ.
You know the word.	O mọ ọrọ naa.
John loves to walk around the city.	John fẹran lati rin ni ayika ilu naa.
I don’t remember much about it.	Emi ko ranti pupọ nipa rẹ.
Good it is and it is not.	O dara o jẹ ati pe kii ṣe.
From nearby buildings, many things.	Lati awọn ile ti o wa nitosi, ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun.
First, the job name is incorrect.	Ni akọkọ, orukọ iṣẹ ko tọ.
Got them for a while.	Ti gba wọn fun igba diẹ.
We have found our new home.	A ti rii ile tuntun wa.
How do you plan to warm up again?	Bawo ni o ṣe tun gbero lati gbona?
She loves to cook and build a house.	O nifẹ lati ṣe ounjẹ ati ṣiṣe ile kan.
But this is a great world to begin with.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ aye nla lati bẹrẹ.
And of course you know how to use it.	Ati pe o daju pe o mọ bi o ṣe le lo.
More women than men at celebrations.	Diẹ sii awọn obinrin ju awọn ọkunrin lọ ni awọn ayẹyẹ.
Everything else changed.	Ohun gbogbo miiran yipada.
But this is new.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ tuntun.
We were great as friends, and that was it.	A jẹ nla bi awọn ọrẹ, ati pe iyẹn ni.
I love this story.	Mo feran itan yii.
They made a mistake, however.	Wọn ṣe aṣiṣe kan, sibẹsibẹ.
How do you do that in every way.	Bawo ni o ṣe pe ni gbogbo ọna.
If this annoys you, you are not alone.	Ti eyi ba binu ọ, iwọ kii ṣe nikan.
But he is dead.	Sugbon o ti ku.
In a few years that will be mine.	Ni ọdun diẹ ti yoo jẹ mi.
But that is not what you say.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ohun ti o sọ.
He is looking at me.	O n wo mi.
She needs some help.	O nilo iranlọwọ diẹ.
If you need it love it.	Ti o ba nilo o nifẹ rẹ.
She sat in the back seat.	O joko ni ẹhin ijoko.
My words hurt the baby.	Ọrọ mi dun ọmọ naa.
You have recovered enough to get back on track.	O ti gba pada to lati pada si ọna.
That report is not new.	Iroyin yẹn kii ṣe tuntun.
You will never meet this person for lunch.	Iwọ kii yoo ti pade eniyan yii fun ounjẹ ọsan.
You may not say no.	O le ma sọ ​​rara.
The money stays here.	Awọn owo duro nibi.
This is what my mother is doing.	Eyi ni iya mi n ṣe.
We do not eat them properly.	A ko jẹ wọn daradara.
But don’t tell him, miss out.	Ṣugbọn maṣe sọ fun u, padanu.
And it won’t.	Ati pe ko ni ṣe.
I have it, and it has me.	Mo ni o, o si ni mi.
I even have two best friends.	Mo paapaa ni awọn ọrẹ to dara julọ meji.
This should not happen.	Eyi ko yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
Older men will come back.	Awọn ọkunrin ti o dagba yoo pada sẹhin.
You and others don’t care about me.	Iwọ ati awọn miiran ko ni aniyan si mi.
He was obviously an instrument and not someone.	O han gbangba pe o jẹ ohun elo ati kii ṣe ẹnikan.
You see, he left me, with these two little ones.	Ṣe o rii, o fi mi silẹ, pẹlu awọn ọmọ kekere meji wọnyi.
Together, we can make this happen.	Papọ, a le ṣe eyi ṣẹlẹ.
I can do better than you.	Mo le ṣe daradara ju iwọ lọ.
Pretty beautiful dress.	Aṣọ lẹwa lẹwa.
He said a lot.	O sọ pupọ.
They all sit.	Gbogbo won joko.
All respect to me.	Gbogbo ọwọ si mi.
This gives.	Eleyi yoo fun.
You must pay.	O gbọdọ san.
I love the way it is so into your wife.	Mo nifẹ awọn ọna ti o jẹ bẹ sinu iyawo rẹ.
For your help.	Fun iranlọwọ rẹ.
He has made a man for me.	O ti ṣe ọkunrin kan fun mi.
I have more energy.	Mo ni agbara diẹ sii.
Do you agree with me ?.	Ṣe o gba pẹlu mi?.
The wife is completely exhausted.	Iyawo naa ti re patapata.
And this is his favorite thing.	Ati pe eyi ni ohun ti o nifẹ julọ.
These are shown below.	Awọn wọnyi ti wa ni han ni isalẹ.
I arrived at a clean area.	Mo de agbegbe ti o mọ.
The boy is doing well.	Ọmọkunrin naa n ṣe daradara.
You have a lot on your mind.	O ni ọpọlọpọ lori ọkan rẹ.
He hit the stand, hot iron.	O lu duro, irin gbona.
You can show it to him.	O le fi han fun u.
It was a great place to work.	O je kan nla ibi a iṣẹ.
That was as given with us.	Ti o wà bi a fi fun pẹlu wa.
People you love.	Awọn eniyan ti o nifẹ.
Everything is happening.	Ohun gbogbo n ṣẹlẹ.
But this time it did not happen.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yii ko ṣẹlẹ.
The power of reason comes from the feet.	Agbara idi wa lati awọn ẹsẹ.
I work for weeks.	Mo ṣiṣẹ fun awọn ọsẹ.
Not the same.	Ko ṣe kanna.
Everyone saw what happened, but no one helped.	Gbogbo eniyan rii ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ, ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe iranlọwọ.
That’s also not good, but it’s obviously good enough.	Iyẹn tun ko dara, ṣugbọn o han gbangba pe o dara to.
You can find it here.	O le rii ni ibi.
I walk on.	Mo rin lori.
That is the best thing.	Ohun to dara julọ niyẹn.
It only makes things harder.	O nikan mu ki ohun le.
It gave him time to plan.	O fun u ni akoko lati gbero.
Just there.	O kan wa nibẹ.
But okay, let’s drop it.	Ṣugbọn o dara, jẹ ki a ju silẹ.
Now, take your rest, you will need it.	Ni bayi, gba isinmi rẹ, iwọ yoo nilo rẹ.
That is also not true.	Iyẹn tun kii ṣe otitọ.
And about us.	Ati nipa wa.
City to city.	Ilu si ilu.
I'll try that.	Emi yoo gbiyanju iyẹn.
We don’t have much time.	A ko ni akoko pupọ.
No one really wants to do that.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹ ṣe iyẹn gaan.
It starts because of what you believe.	O bẹrẹ nitori ohun ti o gbagbọ.
I picked up the phone and called again.	Mo gbe foonu ati pe lẹẹkansi.
I have no money, no place to go.	Emi ko ni owo, ko si aaye lati lọ.
Less than a week before the trip.	Kere ju ọsẹ kan ṣaaju irin-ajo naa.
This method may seem wise, or even clever.	Ọna yii le dabi ọgbọn, tabi paapaa ọgbọn.
Something will have to do about it tomorrow.	Nkankan yoo ni lati ṣe nipa rẹ ni ọla.
But that is not enough for us.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko to fun wa.
Not there.	Ko si nibẹ.
Many children are born with one.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde ni a bi pẹlu ọkan.
Not decided now.	Ti ko pinnu ni bayi.
I am only thirty minutes out.	Mo wa nikan ọgbọn iṣẹju jade.
He never raised his voice.	Ko gbe ohun soke rara.
I can't remember the day.	Nko le ranti ojo wo.
I don’t mean for you to see.	Emi ko tumọ si fun ọ lati rii.
See for yourself.	Wo fun ara rẹ.
Two men, they killed him.	Awọn ọkunrin meji, wọn pa a.
We can not know.	A ko le mọ.
That is enough for now.	Iyẹn ti to fun bayi.
Don’t try to understand, just look at what’s happening and let it go.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati ni oye, kan wo o ti n ṣẹlẹ ki o jẹ ki o lọ.
No one was present.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa.
We were there early to talk.	A wa nibẹ ni kutukutu lati ba sọrọ.
It is very simple.	O rọrun pupọ gaan.
Not many people have to go to your room.	Ko ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni lati lọ si yara rẹ.
I never missed it.	Emi ko padanu rẹ rara.
Which is good.	Eyi ti o dara.
That means he didn’t drink.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe ko mu.
You have heard all this before.	O ti gbọ gbogbo eyi tẹlẹ.
The story is simple.	Itan naa rọrun.
It's more than football.	O ju bọọlu.
Or you can have.	Tabi o le ni.
About a lot of things.	Nipa ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
Feel free to give me some of your ideas.	Lero lati fun mi ni nkan ti awọn ero rẹ.
I have never heard or read that before.	Emi ko tii gbọ tabi ka iyẹn tẹlẹ.
They took off the road.	Wọn ya kuro ni opopona.
And a lot of kids love to do even more.	Ati ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde nifẹ lati ṣe paapaa.
None of them spoke for several minutes.	Eyikeyi ninu wọn ko sọrọ fun ọpọlọpọ iṣẹju.
You just might have made a couple of friends here.	O kan le ti ṣe awọn ọrẹ meji kan nibi.
He moved to open.	O gbe lati ṣii.
He did it.	O ṣe e.
It has to be the first meal.	O ni lati jẹ ounjẹ akọkọ.
Write the word.	Kọ ọrọ naa.
When is the best time to do this?	Nigbawo ni akoko ti o dara julọ lati ṣe eyi?
That is because of the opportunity since then.	Iyẹn jẹ nitori anfani lati igba naa.
I am not one of those people.	Emi kii ṣe ọkan ninu awọn eniyan yẹn.
Of course you do.	Dajudaju o ṣe.
Outside, he is on his own.	Ni ita, o wa fun ara rẹ.
It has worked really well.	O ti ṣiṣẹ daradara daradara.
So you can be the teacher behind me.	Ki o le jẹ olukọ lẹhin mi.
You need to.	O nilo.
You can talk to me.	O le sọrọ si mi.
I will kill everyone.	Emi yoo pa gbogbo eniyan.
Someone has to.	Ẹnikan ni lati.
Students began boarding the school bus.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe bẹrẹ si wọ ọkọ akero ile-iwe naa.
He was a wonderful child.	O jẹ ọmọ iyanu kan.
And you know it's wrong, too.	Ati pe o mọ pe o jẹ aṣiṣe, paapaa.
It's not easy and you know why.	O rọrun kii ṣe ati pe o mọ idi.
I still think of it to this day.	Mo tun ronu rẹ titi di oni.
You will know a little more about it.	Iwọ yoo mọ nipa rẹ diẹ diẹ.
Maybe just be yourself.	Boya o kan jẹ ara rẹ.
Which is obvious.	Eyi ti o han gbangba.
Women always wear a watch.	Obinrin nigbagbogbo wọ aago kan.
In this case, it is.	Ni idi eyi, o jẹ.
Okay, not so much.	O dara, kii ṣe bẹ.
Two.	Meji.
Again, that is me.	Lẹẹkansi, iyẹn ni emi.
He loved this room.	O feran yara yi.
Most of them did not stop.	Pupọ ninu wọn ko duro.
There are so many that will be new.	Pupọ wa ti yoo jẹ tuntun.
Students must learn the importance of time.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe gbọdọ kọ ẹkọ pataki ti akoko.
I said sit down.	Mo sọ pe joko.
You have to change.	O ni lati yipada.
But you have to do it.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati ṣe bẹ.
Sometimes, he forgets that he is there at all.	Nigba miiran, o gbagbe pe o wa nibẹ rara.
You just can not.	O kan ko le.
My meeting started a few minutes ago.	Ipade mi bẹrẹ ni iṣẹju diẹ sẹhin.
Maybe we do, maybe we don’t.	Boya a ṣe, boya a ko.
He raised the money.	O gbe owo naa soke.
You just need rest.	O kan nilo isinmi.
But it is early yet.	Sugbon o ni kutukutu sibẹsibẹ.
That's what they look like.	Iyẹn wo ni oju wọn.
You do not have them.	O ko ni wọn.
As you can see now.	Bi o ti ri ni bayi.
Now you see.	Bayi o rii.
Plan where you will go if you have to leave the area.	Gbero ibi ti iwọ yoo lọ ti o ba ni lati lọ kuro ni agbegbe.
This is your smart girl.	Eyi ni ọmọbirin rẹ ti o ni oye.
In the trees.	Ninu awọn igi.
They know it.	Wọn mọ ọ.
There are three problems with this.	Awọn iṣoro mẹta wa pẹlu eyi.
Some men want to keep their wives at home.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọkunrin fẹ lati tọju awọn iyawo wọn ni ile.
Same for phones.	Kanna fun awọn foonu.
The boy may have a great idea.	Ọmọkunrin naa le ni imọran nla.
As soon as he stopped, his head began to swell.	Ni kete ti o duro, ori rẹ bẹrẹ si yọ.
Everyone should know this.	Gbogbo eniyan yẹ ki o mọ eyi.
When you are small, you have to.	Nigbati o ba jẹ kekere, o ni lati.
This is not your home, your life.	Eyi kii ṣe ile rẹ, igbesi aye rẹ.
Bad hair days are not possible.	Awọn ọjọ irun buburu ko ṣee ṣe.
It is good to get them back.	O dara lati gba wọn pada.
You need more.	O nilo diẹ sii.
How much will you go.	Elo ni iwọ yoo lọ.
They come to work early and stay very late.	Wọn wa lati ṣiṣẹ ni kutukutu ati duro pẹ pupọ.
He does not want to be here.	Oun ko fẹ lati wa nibi.
You have seen.	O ti ri.
He never took a boat.	Ko gba ọkọ oju omi rara.
It’s not for both of us to play.	Ko ṣe fun wa mejeeji lati mu.
I ask everything now.	Mo beere ohun gbogbo ni bayi.
Things will have to change, soon.	Awọn nkan yoo ni lati yipada, laipẹ.
See, do you like it or not.	Wo, ṣe o fẹ tabi rara.
We traveled on foot.	A fi ẹsẹ rin irin-ajo naa.
You can say you like what you see.	O le sọ pe o fẹran ohun ti o rii.
I'm back now.	Mo pada wa bayi.
I met her in a room.	Mo pade rẹ ni yara kan.
If you do not want to move, so be it.	Ti o ko ba fẹ lati gbe, bẹ bẹ.
I did not meet him.	Emi ko pade rẹ.
If that matters.	Ti iyẹn ba ṣe pataki.
Not too late now.	Ko pẹ bayi.
On top of that we all stand amazing.	Lori gbogbo wa duro ti iyanu.
But no one listened.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o gbọ.
It doesn't matter what you call it.	Ko ṣe pataki ohun ti o pe ni.
Soon, no one spoke to me anymore.	Laipẹ, ko si ẹnikan ti o ba mi sọrọ mọ.
He will not look like himself, of course.	Oun kii yoo dabi ara rẹ, dajudaju.
He wants to go home.	O fe ki o si ile.
There is something in the room with us.	Ohun kan wa ninu yara pẹlu wa.
He was the only one who woke up.	Oun nikan lo ji.
It has to be hard.	O ni lati jẹ lile.
And it will stay until tomorrow.	Ati pe yoo duro titi di ọla.
I will not be able to touch it.	Emi kii yoo ni anfani lati fi ọwọ kan rẹ.
Everyone here is like that.	Gbogbo eniyan nibi ni iru bẹ.
However you can leave until then.	Sibẹsibẹ o le fi silẹ titi di akoko naa.
You want to say every name all the time.	O fẹ ki o sọ gbogbo orukọ ni gbogbo igba.
I then wait to eat or to sleep if bed time.	Mo ki o si duro jẹ tabi lati sun ti o ba ti ibusun akoko.
He has changed his story many times.	O ti yi itan rẹ pada ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
You don’t want to lose that life.	O ko fẹ lati padanu aye naa.
He also had another 'meeting', as he was called, with the police.	O tun ni 'ipade' miiran, bi o ti pe ni, pẹlu ọlọpa.
Neither of them were married.	Bẹni awọn ti wọn ni iyawo.
And drink well.	Ki o si mu daradara.
The things we are told to fear are not what we should fear.	Awọn ohun ti a sọ fun wa lati bẹru kii ṣe ohun ti o yẹ ki a bẹru.
Sure, why not.	Daju, kilode ti kii ṣe.
We are all here and we love it.	Gbogbo wa wa nibi ati pe a nifẹ rẹ.
It is a fact of life.	O jẹ otitọ ti igbesi aye.
And in the water.	Ati ninu omi.
He caught up with his cats.	O mu pẹlu rẹ ologbo.
We live in difficult times.	A n gbe ni awọn akoko lile.
But there is a problem.	Ṣugbọn iṣoro kan wa.
This can be understood in one of two ways.	Eyi le ni oye ni ọkan ninu awọn ọna meji.
He is looking at me now.	O n wo mi ni bayi.
Their meeting was amazing.	Ipade wọn jẹ iyalẹnu.
Your news is not so good.	Awọn iroyin rẹ ko dara bẹ.
And, in a way, it is.	Ati, ni ọna kan, o jẹ.
I know what your job is.	Mo mọ kini iṣẹ rẹ jẹ.
I will get through it.	Emi yoo gba nipasẹ rẹ.
Do not talk with him.	Maṣe sọ ọrọ rẹ pẹlu rẹ.
No, no, not this man.	Rara, rara, kii ṣe ọkunrin yii.
Maybe you know what's coming.	Boya o mọ ohun ti n bọ.
Maybe one day that will change.	Boya ni ọjọ kan iyẹn yoo yipada.
It takes a lot of time and is very easy to use.	O gba akoko pupọ ati pe o rọrun pupọ lati lo.
I can't think on my feet.	Emi ko le ronu lori ẹsẹ mi.
Life is hard in this small town.	Igbesi aye wa ni lile ni ilu kekere yii.
It could be one of the first one or two out.	O le jẹ ọkan ninu awọn akọkọ ọkan tabi meji jade.
For some reason summer says you have to do things.	Fun idi kan ooru sọ pe o ni lati ṣe awọn nkan.
I can not.	Emi ko le.
Don't worry about the money.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan nipa owo naa.
I can't feel it this way.	Emi ko le rilara ni ọna yii.
But you can see.	Ṣugbọn o le rii.
Whatever you see, do not tell me.	Ohunkohun ti o ri, ma so fun mi.
And we went.	Ati pe a lọ.
The sun will set in three hours.	Oorun yoo wọ ni wakati mẹta.
He thought he would always be a boy.	O ro pe oun yoo ma jẹ ọmọkunrin nigbagbogbo.
That never used to happen.	Ti o ko lo lati ṣẹlẹ.
I want to look good for him.	Mo fẹ lati wo dara fun u.
There were just so many people.	Nibẹ wà kan ki ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan.
Everyone this is a nice guy.	Gbogbo eniyan eyi ni ọkunrin ti o dara julọ.
Not for any error either.	Ko fun eyikeyi aṣiṣe boya.
I have not used one before.	Emi ko lo ọkan tẹlẹ.
It seems.	O dabi.
I'm confident, like me.	Mo da mi loju, bii emi.
Friends have promised to help in any way they can.	Awọn ọrẹ ti ṣe ileri lati ṣe iranlọwọ ni eyikeyi ọna ti wọn le.
I have never felt this bad thing before.	Emi ko tii rilara nkankan buburu yii tẹlẹ.
I could not write a proper letter while on the train.	Emi ko le kọ lẹta ti o yẹ nigba ti o wa lori ọkọ oju irin.
', je'.	', je'.
I will call the police.	Emi yoo pe ọlọpa.
Change the water to rain.	Yi omi pada si ojo.
You know what the thought should be.	O mọ ohun ti ero yẹ ki o sọ.
When they do, it’s great.	Nigbati wọn ba ṣe, o jẹ nla.
The trees have not been cut in a few years.	Awọn igi ko ti ge ni ọdun diẹ.
Maybe there is an opportunity.	Boya anfani wa.
He loves you for the same reason.	O fẹ ọ fun idi kanna.
One can ask anything.	Eniyan le beere ohunkohun.
We know more about that now.	A mọ diẹ sii nipa iyẹn ni bayi.
He convinced them.	O da wọn loju.
It belongs to me.	O je ti emi.
It would be the same idea.	Yoo jẹ ero kanna.
Do not keep me from your heart.	Maṣe pa mi mọ kuro ninu ọkan rẹ.
He keeps to himself.	O maa n pa ara rẹ mọ si ara rẹ.
Now that the door is locked behind her, nothing is left.	Ni bayi ti ilẹkun ti tii lẹhin rẹ ko si nkankan ti o ku.
Only a few.	Nikan diẹ.
They have no idea in them.	Wọn ko ni imọran ninu wọn.
Some of it is made up with other things.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti o ti wa ni ṣe soke pẹlu ohun miiran.
You have not done it before.	O ko ti ṣe tẹlẹ.
He wonders how long it will take.	O ṣe iyalẹnu bawo ni yoo ṣe pẹ to.
We are great friends.	A jẹ ọrẹ nla.
I'll call tomorrow morning.	Emi yoo foonu ni owurọ ọla.
None of my friends are, especially to this little boy.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ọrẹ mi ti o jẹ, paapaa si ọmọ kekere yii.
We cannot say we want them.	A ko le sọ pe a fẹ wọn.
He went through them again.	O tun lọ nipasẹ wọn lẹẹkansi.
You need something that hasn't changed.	O nilo nkan ti ko yipada.
No money required in advance to get started.	Ko si owo ti a beere ni iwaju lati bẹrẹ.
What it looks like to have a body, it means.	Kini o dabi lati ni ara, o tumọ si.
We are in the wrong place at the wrong time and in the wrong place.	A wa ni ibi ti ko tọ ni akoko ati aaye ti ko tọ.
I stand on stagnant water.	Mo duro lori omi ti o duro.
My men have, of course, never seen.	Awọn ọkunrin mi ti, dajudaju, ko ti ri.
I love it so much!	Mo feran re pupo!
Very good book.	Gan ti o dara iwe.
Don't think about the man.	Maṣe ronu nipa ọkunrin naa.
If you work for them.	Ti o ba ṣiṣẹ fun wọn.
I say no, you don't.	Mo sọ rara, iwọ ko.
Not a bad kind.	Kii ṣe iru buburu kan.
Maybe if you let it out it would go.	Boya ti o ba jẹ ki o jade o yoo lọ.
They were not allowed to visit the doctor.	Wọn ko gba wọn laaye lati ṣabẹwo si dokita.
But soon another one came to take his place.	Ṣugbọn laipẹ ọkan miiran wa lati gba ipo rẹ.
Soon they will try to treat me.	Laipẹ wọn yoo gbiyanju lati tọju mi.
People are arrested.	Awon eniyan ti wa ni mu.
My beautiful sister.	Arabinrin mi lẹwa.
She hurried to help.	O yara lọ lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
This must be the reason.	Eyi gbọdọ jẹ idi.
You have to expect that.	O ni lati nireti iyẹn.
There are no problems.	Ko si awọn iṣoro kankan.
You can’t really ask for more in a car service.	O ko le beere gaan fun diẹ sii ni iṣẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
Maybe we love to talk about it.	Boya a nifẹ lati sọrọ nipa rẹ.
Your father needs to move on.	Baba rẹ nilo lati tẹsiwaju.
Such things have been heard before.	Iru awọn nkan bẹẹ ni a ti gbọ tẹlẹ.
He thought for a few minutes before speaking.	O ronu fun iṣẹju diẹ ṣaaju ki o to sọrọ.
But it does not mean.	Ṣugbọn ko tumọ si.
And it is the best in every field.	Ati pe o dara julọ ni gbogbo aaye.
You can come back now.	O le pada wa ni bayi.
For many it is too much.	Fun ọpọlọpọ o jẹ pupọ pupọ.
I have heard of myself.	Mo ti gbọ ti ara mi.
He is alive now.	O wa laaye ni bayi.
He needs us, and we do nothing to get him back.	O nilo wa, ati pe a ko ṣe ohunkohun lati gba u pada.
There is nothing you can do now.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe ni bayi.
You just want to enjoy it.	O kan fẹ lati gbadun rẹ.
Schools are full.	Awọn ile-iwe ti kun.
The man was bathed.	Ọkunrin naa ti wẹ.
I wonder if people can read it on my forehead.	Mo ro boya awon eniyan le ka o lori mi iwaju.
I can't get it.	Emi ko le gba rẹ.
They only tell you.	Wọn nikan sọ fun ọ.
Stress can take over.	Wahala le mu wa lori.
Just get it on the ear.	O kan gba e ni eti.
I want to watch it.	Mo fẹ lati ma wo o.
What it is will never be forgotten.	Ohun ti o jẹ ko ni gbagbe lailai.
Have not tried to get it into bed.	Ti ko gbiyanju lati gba rẹ sinu ibusun.
It's too small.	O jẹ kekere pupọ.
So now we are all trying.	Nitorina bayi a n gbiyanju gbogbo wa.
It is noticeable by a local book.	O jẹ akiyesi nipasẹ iwe agbegbe kan.
But it does not seem that everything changed or anything.	Ṣugbọn ko dabi pe ohun gbogbo yipada tabi ohunkohun.
People have to feel.	Eniyan ni lati lero.
He kept it very close to her.	O tọju rẹ pupọ si ọdọ rẹ.
You should know that very well.	O yẹ ki o mọ iyẹn gaan.
He stayed long in the office.	O duro pẹ ni ọfiisi.
Just a passion.	O kan ife gidigidi.
In a word, full.	Ninu ọrọ kan, ti o kun.
Like him they are here for personal reasons.	Bii rẹ wọn wa nibi fun awọn idi ti ara ẹni.
A new road should be built.	Opopona tuntun yẹ ki o kọ.
The old tree gave way.	Atijọ igi fi ọna.
I'm not sorry.	Emi ko binu.
I do not know what will happen.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Living conditions are not very good here.	Awọn ipo igbesi aye ko dara pupọ nibi.
That’s not the way it works.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ọna ti o ṣiṣẹ.
The task is not easy.	Iṣẹ naa ko rọrun.
It looks like an accident.	O dabi ijamba.
Maybe you don’t remember me.	Boya o ko ranti mi.
They are all good places.	Gbogbo wọn jẹ awọn aaye to dara.
And so it continues.	Ati bẹ o tẹsiwaju.
Lots of people.	Pupọ eniyan pupọ.
Other kids grow up to be bad people.	Awọn ọmọde miiran dagba lati jẹ eniyan buburu.
No one has, as you know.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ni, bi o ti mọ.
I have three children.	Mo ni awọn ọmọde mẹta.
This will make the day even bigger.	Eyi yoo jẹ ki ọjọ nla paapaa dun.
Something no one here can do.	Nkankan ti ko si eniyan nibi le ṣe.
If you do this, do not wait.	Ti o ba ṣe eyi, maṣe duro.
I wrapped my legs around something below his head.	Mo ti awọn ẹsẹ mi ni ayika nkan ti o wa ni isalẹ ori rẹ.
Classes are small.	Awọn kilasi jẹ kekere.
If you believe in love.	Ti o ba gbagbọ ninu ifẹ.
We know who the mother is.	A mọ ẹniti iya jẹ.
'We are very tired.	'O rẹ wa pupọ.
They are bad.	Wọn jẹ buburu.
Police often see people.	Awọn ọlọpa maa n rii eniyan nigbagbogbo.
That is, it is not.	Iyẹn ni, kii ṣe bẹẹ.
No one says life is easy.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ pe igbesi aye rọrun.
Obviously, do whatever you can.	O han ni, ṣe ohunkohun ti o le.
There are special rules to write.	Awọn ofin pataki wa lati kọ.
We will not leave you.	A ko ni fi ọ silẹ.
This type of weather always makes it easy.	Iru oju ojo yii nigbagbogbo jẹ ki o rọrun.
People will talk.	Eniyan yoo sọrọ.
Maybe he knows his wife better than anyone else.	Boya o mọ iyawo rẹ daradara ju ẹnikẹni miiran lọ.
Your whole life.	Gbogbo aye re.
You have to be a great person this long time.	O gbọdọ jẹ eniyan nla ni igba pipẹ yii.
You have to give.	O ni lati fun.
You understand very little.	O loye pupọ diẹ.
Maybe they want me to stand for myself.	Boya wọn fẹ ki n duro fun ara mi.
The issue doesn’t stop there, however.	Ọrọ naa ko duro nibẹ, sibẹsibẹ.
Your dog needs attention and love every day.	Aja rẹ nilo akiyesi ati ifẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
But there is one that is new.	Ṣugbọn ọkan wa ti o jẹ tuntun.
We get a lot of help every year.	A gba ọpọlọpọ iranlọwọ ni gbogbo ọdun.
Some can't even get out of bed.	Diẹ ninu awọn ko le paapaa jade kuro ni ibusun.
They have three living children.	Wọn ni ọmọ mẹta ti ngbe.
Many cities were sold.	Awọn ọpọlọpọ ilu ni wọn ta.
That is great work.	Ise nla niyen.
Not the same today.	Kii ṣe kanna loni.
She was afraid of him.	O bẹru rẹ.
They were happy to work for me, to be my son.	Inu wọn dun lati ṣiṣẹ fun mi, lati jẹ ọmọkunrin mi.
Those who do nothing for the environment.	Awon ti ko se nkankan fun ayika.
I would be a doctor.	Emi yoo jẹ dokita.
I was there and did that.	Mo ti wa nibẹ ati ki o ṣe pe.
See if you can.	Wo boya o.
I am using this for the first time.	Mo n lo eyi fun igba akọkọ.
If you can’t have electricity, you can’t make bread.	Ti o ko ba le ni ina, o ko le ṣe akara.
But that is not all.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe iyẹn nikan.
He told me he could not wait long.	O sọ fun mi pe ko le duro pẹ.
Today is our day.	Loni ni ọjọ wa.
And you can't look inside.	Ati pe o ko le wo inu.
Can you feel it?	Ṣe o le lero rẹ?
You just need the right time.	O kan nilo akoko ti o tọ.
He will need it when he arrives.	Oun yoo nilo rẹ nigbati o ba de.
I will open a word for that.	Emi yoo ṣii ọrọ kan fun iyẹn.
The restaurant is full.	Ile ounjẹ naa ti kun.
We want the team to improve and understand more.	A fẹ ki ẹgbẹ naa dara si ati oye diẹ sii.
I went forever it seems.	Mo ti lọ lailai o dabi.
And it’s still there, so they say.	Ati pe o tun wa nibẹ, nitorina wọn sọ.
But more on that a little back then.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii lori iyẹn diẹ sẹhin.
That means in those moments you didn’t ask for anything.	Eyi tumọ si ni awọn akoko yẹn o ko beere ohunkohun.
I learned a lot, but that’s over now.	Mo kọ ẹkọ pupọ, ṣugbọn iyẹn ti pari ni bayi.
We can confirm it now.	A le rii daju lo ni bayi.
We hope the advice can help you !.	A nireti pe imọran le ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ!.
We can count their houses.	A le ka ile wọn.
I changed the station.	Mo yipada ibudo naa.
A few points can be made, however.	Awọn aaye diẹ le ṣee ṣe, sibẹsibẹ.
He came back to me.	O pada si ọdọ mi.
It is something that people can remember after being told.	O jẹ nkan ti eniyan le ranti lẹhin ti a ti sọ fun wọn.
We should look up, but not now.	A yẹ ki o wo soke, ṣugbọn kii ṣe bayi.
Okay, wait a minute.	O dara, duro rara.
This area has little value.	Agbegbe yii ko ni iye diẹ.
They need us and we need them.	Wọn nilo wa ati pe a nilo wọn.
Is this seat taken?	Ṣe o ti mu ijoko yi?
Let's try it now.	Jẹ ká gbiyanju o bayi.
And they are.	Ati pe wọn jẹ.
It is not even difficult to fly like that.	Ko nira paapaa lati fo bi iyẹn.
But it is not beautiful.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe lẹwa.
Leave the story to me.	Fi itan naa silẹ fun mi.
That is, things are like the things we see.	Iyẹn ni, awọn nkan dabi awọn nkan ti a rii.
But you will let yourself be sucked into it.	Ṣugbọn iwọ yoo jẹ ki ara rẹ mu u sinu.
They are here to help.	Wọn wa nibi lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
Even hot weather.	Oju ojo gbona paapaa.
But he made no mistake at all.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe aṣiṣe rara.
Please let us eat.	Jọwọ jẹ ki a jẹ.
I am not hungry.	Emi ko ni ebi.
This is something your doctor will need.	Eyi jẹ nkan ti dokita rẹ yoo nilo.
It was a break in me.	O jẹ adehun ninu mi.
We waited until he got home to find another dog.	A duro titi o fi de ile lati wa aja miiran.
I did not say.	Emi ko sọ.
It has to be enough.	O ni lati to.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Boya, boya, boya.
I think he was very scared.	Mo ro pe o bẹru pupọ.
When someone leaves the room, he returns.	Nigbati ẹnikan ba jade kuro ni yara, o pada.
This button will open the door.	Bọtini yii yoo ṣii ilẹkun.
Something needs to be done.	Nkankan nilo lati ṣee.
On that, we agree.	Lori iyẹn, a gba.
You know, any kind they sell.	O mọ, iru eyikeyi ti wọn ta.
Maybe he would, one day or another, have thought of it himself.	Boya oun yoo, ni ọjọ kan tabi alẹ, ti ronu rẹ funrararẹ.
Many cars are purchased this way.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ni a ra ni ọna yii.
Leave it to me.	Fi silẹ fun mi.
He will take the lead in his new company.	Oun yoo gba iwaju ni ile-iṣẹ tuntun rẹ.
My idea is.	Ero mi ti wa.
But we all know.	Ṣugbọn gbogbo wa mọ.
I do not see.	Emi ko ri.
After hours of this we saw nothing.	Lẹhin awọn wakati ti eyi a ko ri nkankan.
Some of them may bring themselves to remember, now and again.	Diẹ ninu wọn le mu ara wọn wa lati ranti, ni bayi ati lẹẹkansi.
I accept that as no.	Mo gba iyẹn bi rara.
I never told anyone what to believe.	Emi ko sọ fun ẹnikan kini lati gbagbọ.
But it is.	Sugbon o jẹ.
I am hungry.	Ebi n pa mi.
I really hope you do.	Mo nireti gaan pe o ṣe.
We know it.	A mọ ọ.
They did and people were angry that they did.	Wọn ṣe ati awọn eniyan binu pe wọn ṣe.
I don't know why not.	Emi ko mọ idi ti o ko.
Mother continued to tell me stories in very small things.	Iya tẹsiwaju lati sọ awọn itan fun mi ni ohun kekere pupọ.
He brought trouble.	O mu wahala wa.
Parents help what everyone should be.	Awọn obi ṣe iranlọwọ ti gbogbo eniyan yẹ ki o jẹ.
I have changed the system.	Mo ti yi eto pada.
We are leaving in two hours.	A n lọ ni wakati meji.
I can go back to school.	Mo le pada si ile-iwe.
Change your life.	Yi aye re pada.
When we arrived at the station, there were no trains.	Nigbati a de ibudo, ko si awọn ọkọ oju irin.
You have a body.	O ni ara.
This is true for everyone.	Eyi jẹ otitọ fun gbogbo eniyan.
But that’s not really the case, either.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ ni otitọ, boya.
Use whatever you want and whatever you can find.	Lo ohunkohun ti o fẹ ati ohunkohun ti o le ri.
This is the way it is.	Eyi jẹ ọna ti o jẹ.
This is your only life to leave.	Eyi nikan ni aye rẹ lati lọ kuro.
My father died at the age of thirty.	Baba mi ku ni ọgbọn ọdun.
I do not mean to do so.	Emi ko tumọ lati ṣe bẹ.
But back after his wife went to bed.	Ṣugbọn pada lẹhin ti iyawo rẹ lọ si ibusun.
Every house in this new house has a garden.	Gbogbo ile ni ile tuntun yii ni ọgba kan.
There is no other reason to come.	Ko ni idi miiran lati wa.
He never asked anyone again.	Ko tun beere lọwọ ẹnikẹni.
If they have a day off, understand why.	Ti wọn ba ni isinmi ọjọ kan, loye idi.
You can not wait anymore.	O ko le duro mọ.
His team lost.	Ẹgbẹ rẹ padanu.
Your work is not possible with just one hand.	Iṣẹ rẹ ko ṣee ṣe pẹlu ọwọ kan nikan.
My phone in the morning.	Foonu mi ni owurọ.
Some people hit me that way.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan kan kan mi ni ọna yẹn.
He has a story with him.	O ni itan pẹlu rẹ.
No, maybe you shouldn’t.	Rara, boya o dara ki o ma ṣe.
I want to have some space there.	Mo fẹ lati ni aaye diẹ nibẹ.
That’s what we want right now.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti a fẹ ni bayi.
Maybe we should walk.	Boya a yẹ ki a rin.
Now that is gone.	Bayi iyẹn ti lọ.
I have no idea what is going on.	Emi ko ni imọran ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
In many cases, in fact.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba, ni otitọ.
I hope you will see the same.	Mo nireti pe iwọ yoo rii kanna.
You have to want to do it.	O ni lati fẹ lati ṣe.
Something here is not entirely true.	Nkankan nibi kii ṣe otitọ patapata.
I try to write a story more.	Mo gbiyanju lati kọ itan kan diẹ sii.
He left the room.	O kuro ninu yara naa.
He taught me everything.	O kọ mi ohun gbogbo.
There is nothing in the works that remembers it.	Ko si ohun ti o wa ninu awọn iṣẹ ti o ranti rẹ.
We want you to go.	A fẹ ki o lọ.
Of course, this is not an easy task.	Dajudaju, eyi kii ṣe iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
I did not expect it to work but it did.	Emi ko nireti pe yoo ṣiṣẹ ṣugbọn o ṣe.
I am on the road.	Mo wa loju ọna.
I think we will use it on the bar.	Mo ro pe a yoo lo lori igi naa.
I went for a drive.	Mo lọ fun a wakọ.
Most of the time, you will not hear from them anymore.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba, iwọ kii yoo gbọ lati ọdọ wọn mọ.
Today he made the same mistake again.	Loni o tun ṣe aṣiṣe kanna.
It’s about performance.	O jẹ nipa iṣẹ ṣiṣe.
It lets you go for now.	O jẹ ki o lọ fun bayi.
I suspect he has no other reason.	Mo fura pe ko ni idi miiran.
Just start with it.	Kan bẹrẹ pẹlu rẹ.
He wants to move.	O fe lati gbe.
Maybe we will.	Boya a yoo.
You know it's worth it.	O mọ pe o tọ.
Details are in your body.	Awọn alaye wa ninu ara rẹ.
But, it is what it is.	Ṣugbọn, o jẹ ohun ti o jẹ.
Add water to the box.	Fi omi kun apoti naa.
Maybe I will never see one.	Boya Emi kii yoo rii ọkan lailai.
But you have to go.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati lọ.
But that cannot continue forever.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko le tẹsiwaju lailai.
Not any old football, naturally.	Ko eyikeyi atijọ bọọlu, nipa ti.
That was my main concern.	Iyẹn ni akọkọ aniyan mi.
The tree is burned.	A sun igi.
The weather does not work or not.	Oju ojo o ṣiṣẹ tabi rara.
In this case, no space is visible.	Ni ipo yii, ko si aaye ti o han.
At the same time, her parents gave her a car.	Ni akoko kanna, awọn obi rẹ fun u ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
He did not come outside.	Ko wa si ita.
He died in error.	O ti ku ni aṣiṣe.
Whatever you ask for.	Ohunkohun ti o beere fun.
We will do anything for you.	A yoo ṣe ohunkohun fun o.
This is your son.	Eyi ni ọmọkunrin rẹ.
You have not gone through it.	O ko ti lọ nipasẹ rẹ.
Everyone is talking.	Gbogbo eniyan n sọrọ.
very hot.	gbona gan.
Must talk with.	Gbọdọ sọrọ pẹlu.
And maybe it will make you cut a lot.	Ati boya yoo jẹ ki o ge pupọ.
It was a happy time.	O je kan dun akoko.
No one should be included.	Ko si ọkan yẹ ki o wa ti o wa.
However it has a lot to say.	Sibẹsibẹ o ni ọpọlọpọ lati sọ tẹlẹ.
They become young.	Wọn di odo.
You do not know who he is.	O ko mọ ẹniti o jẹ.
He will wait until he is sure.	O yoo duro titi o fi mọ daju.
We ended up taking advantage of.	A pari ni a gba anfani ti.
Maybe it should change.	Boya o yẹ ki o yipada.
So it seems that they are both doing the same thing.	Nitorina o dabi pe awọn mejeeji n ṣe ohun kanna.
It will not work without that.	Kii yoo ṣiṣẹ laisi iyẹn.
There is nothing better to do.	Ko si ohun ti o dara ju lati ṣe.
Her mother said she loved him.	Iya rẹ sọ pe o nifẹ rẹ.
Please pull it off.	Jọwọ fa kuro.
Or at least give him a better life.	Tabi o kere ju fun u ni aye ti o dara julọ.
We will try next time.	A yoo gbiyanju nigba miiran.

Use this opportunity to make friends.	Lo anfani yii lati ṣe awọn ọrẹ.
We are all doing so much.	Gbogbo wa n ṣe pupọ julọ.
It is possible with your phone cord.	O ṣee ṣe pẹlu okun foonu rẹ.
We changed.	A yipada.
There are a few reasons.	Awọn idi diẹ wa.
These are historic buildings.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn ile itan.
The agreement will only be valid on the device to be used.	Adehun yoo wa ni otitọ nikan lori ẹrọ lati ṣee lo.
He looked at his watch again.	O tun wo aago rẹ lẹẹkansi.
I will be there at the appointed time.	Emi yoo wa nibẹ ni akoko ti a pinnu.
All this is not always possible.	Gbogbo eyi ko ṣee ṣe nigbagbogbo.
The car seemed to be just coming from the store.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa dabi ẹni pe o kan nbọ lati ile itaja.
We do not know why.	A ko mọ idi.
It is not clean.	O ko wẹ.
What city do you live in?	Ilu wo ni o ti n gbe?
I love it and it lifts me up more.	Mo nifẹ rẹ ati pe o gbe mi diẹ sii.
Men live and women die.	Awọn ọkunrin n gbe ati awọn obinrin ku.
he thought.	o ro.
Please help me to keep an eye on you.	Jọwọ ran mi lọwọ lati tọju oju rẹ.
I do not agree.	Emi ko gba.
I have a kind of company doing this to me.	Mo ni iru ile-iṣẹ kan ṣe eyi si mi.
You know it's possible.	O mọ pe o ṣee ṣe.
Some things you are interested in there.	Diẹ ninu awọn nkan ti o nifẹ si nibẹ.
Just a value depending on how you read.	O kan iye ti o da lori bi o ṣe ka.
But it was too good to be missed.	Sugbon o je ju ti o dara anfani lati padanu.
But donations dropped.	Ṣugbọn awọn ẹbun silẹ.
They need our help.	Wọn nilo iranlọwọ wa.
My parents understand.	Awọn obi mi loye.
You won’t get bored at the end of an hour.	Iwọ kii yoo rẹ ara rẹ ni ipari aago kan.
It grows when it can grow.	O dagba nigbati o le dagba.
He returned to his room.	O pada si yara rẹ.
But your plans no longer matter.	Ṣugbọn awọn eto rẹ ko ṣe pataki mọ.
Wondering if we will ever know.	Iyalẹnu boya a yoo mọ lailai.
No, they are not good at all, not many of them.	Rara, wọn ko dara rara, kii ṣe pupọ ninu wọn.
To appear.	Lati han.
You don’t know anything about anything else either.	O ko mọ nkankan nipa ohunkohun miiran boya.
Not your table, either.	Kii ṣe tabili rẹ, boya.
You will feel wrong to say nothing.	O yoo lero ti ko tọ lati ko sọ nkankan.
Also needs a little more.	Tun nilo diẹ kekere.
Until someone does, we can not prove our point.	Titi ẹnikan yoo fi ṣe, a ko le fi idi imọran wa han.
They can make fire or fire from anything.	Wọn le ṣe ina tabi ina lati ohunkohun.
So we brought them back.	Nitorina a mu wọn pada wa.
There is no truth in or saying that he did so.	Ko si otitọ ninu tabi sọ pe o ṣe bẹ.
First, go get a new phone for yourself.	Ni akọkọ, lọ gba foonu tuntun fun ara rẹ.
I wouldn’t have to go to the exam or anything.	Emi kii yoo ni lati lọ si idanwo tabi ohunkohun.
Help me out of this.	Ran mi lọwọ kuro ninu eyi.
Our job is not to find their bus for them.	Iṣẹ wa kii ṣe lati wa ọkọ akero wọn fun wọn.
But you have to make tough decisions.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati ṣe awọn ipinnu lile.
It was lunch at noon.	O jẹ ounjẹ ọsan ni ọsan.
With him.	Pẹlu i.
The house is still standing.	Ile naa tun duro.
Picture art.	Aworan aworan.
He believed that people should help those in need.	O gbagbọ pe eniyan gbọdọ ran awọn ti o nilo lọwọ.
Not for everyone.	Kii ṣe fun gbogbo eniyan.
But this is not the only one.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe ọkan nikan.
It’s easy to make lunch, he said.	O rọrun lati ṣe ounjẹ ọsan, o sọ.
So is my family.	Bẹẹ ni idile mi.
That is advice.	Iyẹn jẹ imọran.
It makes life so much easier.	O jẹ ki igbesi aye rọrun pupọ.
But their faces have been seen before, and often.	Ṣugbọn awọn oju ara wọn ti o ti ri ṣaaju ki o to, ati igba.
I can keep the whole work down.	Mo le pa gbogbo iṣẹ naa si isalẹ.
They love me.	Wọn fẹran mi.
To leave all good positions for men.	Lati fi gbogbo awọn ipo ti o dara silẹ fun awọn ọkunrin.
I hope so too.	Mo nireti bẹ naa.
Don't delay.	Maṣe pẹ.
He has no money.	Ko ni owo.
It doesn't seem right.	Ko dabi ẹni pe o tọ.
You may ask why.	O le beere idi ti.
You have not done it before.	O ko ti ṣe tẹlẹ.
Just give him some space.	Kan fun u ni aaye diẹ.
However he could not make more mistakes.	Sibẹsibẹ ko le ṣe aṣiṣe diẹ sii.
It took the girls hours to get the job done.	O gba awọn ọmọbirin naa wakati lati gba iṣẹ naa.
There is nothing that you do that makes you feel better.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣe ti o mu ki ara rẹ dara.
They refuse to believe.	Wọn kọ lati gbagbọ.
I want you to think about tomorrow.	Mo fẹ ki o ronu nipa ọla.
And that is enough.	Ati pe iyẹn ti to.
I asked him, and he said he wanted to do it.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ, o si sọ pe o fẹ ṣe.
Please say.	Jọwọ sọ.
Please, do not kill me.	Jọwọ, maṣe pa mi.
Your body is very good about things.	Ara rẹ dara pupọ nipa awọn nkan.
He has visited many areas.	O ti ṣabẹwo si ọpọlọpọ awọn agbegbe.
However, the time was not wasted.	Sibẹsibẹ, akoko naa ko padanu.
They asked me.	Wọn beere lọwọ mi.
Or so it appears.	Tabi ki o han.
My friends will not talk to me.	Awọn ọrẹ mi ko ni ba mi sọrọ.
He will tell them.	Oun yoo sọ fun wọn.
Okay, enjoy yourself.	O dara, gbadun ara rẹ.
You have money.	O ni owo.
He walked for hours, enjoying the sight.	O rin fun awọn wakati, ti o gbadun oju.
It sounds friends.	O dun awọn ọrẹ.
He didn’t want a party or anything.	Ko fẹ ayẹyẹ kan tabi ohunkohun.
We need them and they need us.	A nilo wọn ati pe wọn nilo wa.
This is how they work in very simple terms.	Eyi ni bii wọn ṣe n ṣiṣẹ ni awọn ofin ti o rọrun pupọ.
I do not know if it has already happened.	Emi ko mọ boya o ti ṣe tẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
They are asking everyone, door to door.	Wọn n beere lọwọ gbogbo eniyan, ile de ile.
Eyes are everywhere.	Oju wa nibi gbogbo.
The operation was repeated three times.	Iṣẹ naa tun ṣe ni igba mẹta.
He could not take his picture.	Ko le ya aworan rẹ.
It is everything and more.	O jẹ ohun gbogbo ati diẹ sii.
But we cannot let that happen.	Ṣugbọn a ko le jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
I have to stop.	Mo ni lati da.
Now listen to me.	Bayi gbọ mi.
The word came out wrong.	Ọrọ wa jade ti ko tọ.
You really need to try these.	O nilo gaan lati gbiyanju awọn wọnyi.
Tomorrow does another.	Ọla ṣe miiran.
She hopes to become a doctor one day.	O nireti lati di dokita ni ọjọ kan.
They knew it was coming.	Wọn mọ pe o n bọ.
You do not need to open your eyes.	O ko nilo lati ṣii oju rẹ.
Fortunately, there is an easy way to do this.	O da, ọna ti o rọrun wa lati ṣe eyi.
He looks at our faces.	O wo oju wa.
It would be better if you did not do so.	Yoo dara julọ ti o ko ba ṣe bẹ.
I will not be able to do it, man.	Emi kii yoo ni anfani lati ṣe, eniyan.
Work to realize this.	Ṣiṣẹ ki o le mọ eyi.
To something.	Si nkan kan.
I do not like you, either.	Emi ko fẹran yin, boya.
You will find new stores in this area.	Iwọ yoo wa awọn ile itaja tuntun ni agbegbe yii.
He did not tell me anything.	Ko sọ fun mi nkankan.
No one knows him.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ ọ.
Not anything here but buildings.	Kii ṣe nkan nibi ṣugbọn awọn ile.
I just.	Mo kan.
First, you have to wash your hands.	Ni akọkọ, o ni lati wẹ ọwọ rẹ.
The truth, however, is one.	Otitọ, bi o ti jẹ, jẹ ọkan.
She hurried back to bed.	O yara sare pada si ibusun.
It's too long.	O ti gun ju.
They really thought they could be.	Wọn ro gaan pe wọn le jẹ.
But he can't find it today.	Sugbon ko le ri e loni.
And there is also room for a few more items.	Ati pe yara tun wa fun awọn ohun kan diẹ diẹ sii.
Everything is in this game.	Ohun gbogbo ni lo ri ni ere yi.
Our name is important.	Orukọ wa ṣe pataki.
It sounds more.	O dun diẹ sii.
He lives in it.	O ngbe inu rẹ.
He would have loved his stuff.	Oun yoo ti nifẹ nkan rẹ.
He is looking at me.	O n wo mi.
Citizens were outraged by the decision.	Awọn ara ilu binu nipasẹ ipinnu naa.
Games are getting special.	Awọn ere ti n ṣe pataki.
He doesn't like that word.	Ko fẹran ọrọ yẹn.
Or maybe it’s the sun you love to hate.	Tabi boya o jẹ oorun ti o nifẹ lati korira.
So very alive.	Nitorina laaye pupọ.
They didn’t notice me at all.	Wọn ko ṣe akiyesi mi rara.
The idea is not true.	Ero kii ṣe otitọ.
He moved as he touched.	O gbe bi o ti fi ọwọ kan.
I hope you enjoy it.	Mo nireti pe o gbadun rẹ.
But it’s not just work.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe iṣẹ nikan.
I think important.	Mo ro pataki.
There is nothing to plan.	Ko si nkankan lati gbero.
This car is faster than the one you bought.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yii n yara ju eyi ti o ra lọ.
I did so.	Mo ṣe bẹ.
But this obviously does not work.	Ṣugbọn eyi han gbangba ko ṣiṣẹ.
It can be seen in your eyes.	O le rii ni oju rẹ.
This world is the first to live.	Aye yii ni akọkọ lati gbe igbesi aye.
He also did not know what to say to her.	O tun ko mọ ohun ti yoo sọ fun u.
That's how it should be.	Bi o ṣe yẹ ki o jẹ niyẹn.
It helped my decision.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun ipinnu mi.
We don’t have the time we need.	A ko ni akoko ti a nilo.
However we still know very little about it.	Sibẹsibẹ a tun mọ pupọ diẹ nipa rẹ.
Learn with them.	Kọ ẹkọ pẹlu wọn.
I was the only one who saw nothing.	Emi nikan ni mo ri ohunkohun.
Don't make me laugh.	Maṣe jẹ ki n rẹrin.
These people are real.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi jẹ otitọ.
Others try to have both methods.	Awọn miiran gbiyanju lati ni awọn ọna mejeeji.
I am in class.	Mo wa ni kilasi.
I know you well.	Mo mọ ọ daradara.
But under the best conditions.	Ṣugbọn labẹ awọn ipo to dara julọ.
He wants us to come to his house.	O fẹ wa si ile rẹ.
At a time like this, especially.	Ni akoko bii eyi, paapaa.
But it was forever now.	Sugbon o je lailai bayi.
As it does not have you to keep it from.	Bi o ko ni ni rẹ lati tọju o lati.
And not just eat.	Ati pe ko kan jẹun.
Not sure if they go together or not.	Ko daju ti wọn ba lọ papọ tabi rara.
Not what we said.	Kii ṣe ohun ti a sọ.
But there is a problem like this.	Ṣugbọn iṣoro kan wa bi eleyi.
I just have to do.	Mo kan ni lati ṣe.
My life needs me.	Aye mi nilo mi.
But it does not matter.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe pataki.
These days, of course it’s a phone.	Awọn ọjọ wọnyi, dajudaju o jẹ foonu kan.
It's too big, your surprise.	O ju nla lọ, iyalẹnu rẹ.
I didn’t go either.	Emi ko lọ boya.
We have always been in it before.	A wà nigbagbogbo ninu rẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
There are a few ways to handle this.	Awọn ọna diẹ wa lati mu eyi.
A new book is another way for you to learn.	Iwe tuntun jẹ ọna miiran fun ọ lati kọ ẹkọ.
I stand nearby.	Mo duro nitosi.
Of course it is in your mind.	Dajudaju o wa ninu ọkan rẹ.
Everything you have ever written.	Ohun gbogbo ti o ti kọ ọ lailai.
Now head in another direction.	Bayi ori ni ọna miiran.
I killed many of them.	Mo pa ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn.
However, my students did not do well.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ọmọ ile-iwe mi ko ṣe daradara.
You are not there.	Iwọ ko wa nibẹ.
He wrote every question.	O kọ gbogbo ibeere.
They are not married yet, but there is a lot there.	Wọn ko tii ṣe igbeyawo sibẹsibẹ, ṣugbọn o wa pupọ nibẹ.
Just in time.	O kan ni akoko ti o ba wa.
Children do this physically.	Awọn ọmọde ṣe eyi nipa ti ara.
If you haven’t met her, you don’t know her.	Ti o ko ba ti pade rẹ, iwọ ko mọ ọ.
It can be yours, it can be yours.	O le jẹ tirẹ, o le jẹ tirẹ.
It is the least we can do.	O jẹ ohun ti o kere julọ ti a le ṣe.
It will mean more than you know !.	Yoo tumọ si diẹ sii ju ti o mọ!.
Tell the world by one.	Sọ aye nipasẹ ọkan.
Of course it should be.	Dajudaju o yẹ ki o jẹ.
And he does not know.	Ati pe ko mọ.
But they are.	Ṣugbọn wọn wa.
Sorry to be the one who will break for you.	Ma binu lati jẹ ẹni ti yoo fọ fun ọ.
It was their own decision.	O jẹ ipinnu ti ara wọn ṣe.
I do not expect it to be such a place.	Emi ko nireti pe yoo jẹ iru aaye bẹẹ.
You have to be good.	O ni lati dara.
Find something wrong.	Ri nkankan ti ko tọ.
This guy seems to know a lot about this city.	Arakunrin yii dabi ẹni pe o mọ pupọ nipa ilu yii.
His mouth began to move but nothing.	Ẹnu rẹ bẹrẹ si gbe ṣugbọn ko si ohun.
Let me explain that.	Jẹ ki n ṣe alaye pe.
This is a good place as any.	Eyi jẹ aaye to dara bi eyikeyi.
And the unit is too small.	Ati awọn kuro ti wa ni ju kekere.
There is no other way around this.	Ko si ọna miiran ni ayika eyi.
This is to become my family.	Eyi ni lati di idile mi.
You know the value of the picture.	O mọ iye ti aworan naa.
Stand by them, keep an eye on them.	Duro si wọn, tọju wọn ni oju.
He will not give.	Oun yoo ko fun ni.
The roads are full of buses.	Awọn opopona ti kun fun awọn ọkọ akero.
Just tell us where to put it.	Kan so fun wa ibi ti lati fi o.
All decisions are made by one.	Gbogbo awọn ipinnu ni a ṣe nipasẹ ọkan.
Thus, we consider the following system.	Bayi, a ro awọn wọnyi eto.
The highest point in the area is in this area.	Oke ti o ga julọ ni agbegbe naa wa ni agbegbe yii.
But the truth is that this is the work you have to do.	Ṣugbọn otitọ ni pe eyi ni iṣẹ ti o ni.
He tried, he really did.	O gbiyanju, o ṣe gaan.
He moved here before this year.	O gbe nibi ṣaaju ọdun yii.
They stayed there for two years.	Wọn duro nibẹ fun ọdun meji.
What happened here today is not wrong.	Ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nibi loni kii ṣe aṣiṣe.
I stand down.	Mo duro ni isalẹ.
I don’t want to make a mistake.	Emi ko fẹ lati ṣe aṣiṣe.
Some companies have a huge advantage.	Awọn ile-iṣẹ kan ni anfani pupọ.
You may be arrested.	O ṣee ṣe ki wọn mu ọ.
Iron and steel are made from iron and from iron.	Irin ati irin ti wa ni ṣe lati irin ati lati irin.
He hated the sea.	O si korira okun.
This is good.	Eyi dara.
How long can it last?	Bawo ni o ṣe le pẹ to.
He was on his feet for a minute.	O wa lori ẹsẹ rẹ ni iṣẹju kan.
The baby should drink more water.	Ọmọ naa yẹ ki o mu omi diẹ sii.
The company has big plans for the future.	Ile-iṣẹ naa ni awọn ero nla fun ọjọ iwaju.
He was obviously angry.	O han gbangba pe o binu.
Your report is due.	Iroyin rẹ jẹ nitori.
It's pretty small, but maybe you can see it.	O lẹwa kekere, ṣugbọn boya o le rii.
His wife.	Iyawo e.
It must be some of our people.	O gbọdọ jẹ diẹ ninu awọn eniyan wa.
You may not eat.	O le ma jẹun.
Drinks are starting to help.	Ohun mimu ti bẹrẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
At least, the last three are not someone’s father.	O kere ju, awọn mẹta ti o kẹhin ti kii ṣe baba ẹnikan.
It removes both.	O yọ awọn mejeeji kuro.
There is no way for him to do it now.	Ko si ọna rara fun u lati ṣe ni bayi.
That can change things.	Iyẹn le yi awọn nkan pada.
We do not know where he is.	A ko mọ ibi ti o wa.
I should have been worried.	Mo yẹ ki o ti ni aniyan.
His speech was well understood and well understood.	Ọrọ rẹ jẹ oye ati alaye daradara.
We are trying to understand everything.	A n gbiyanju lati ni oye ohun gbogbo.
If they do not like our rules they should leave.	Ti wọn ko ba fẹran awọn ofin wa ki wọn lọ kuro.
About where you are and where you plan to go.	Nipa ibiti o ti wa ati ibiti o gbero lati lọ.
But at the very least.	Ṣugbọn o kere pupọ.
It continues to work in because it is very important.	O tẹsiwaju lati ṣiṣẹ ni nitori pe o ṣe pataki pupọ.
But it was a team game.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ere ẹgbẹ kan.
Anything you can do will be done well.	Ohunkohun ti o le ṣe yoo ṣee ṣe daradara.
And they always do.	Ati pe wọn ṣe nigbagbogbo.
You look at the clock.	O wo ni aago.
Not now, not yet.	Ko bayi, ko sibẹsibẹ.
Nearby but not accessible.	Nitosi ṣugbọn ko le de ọdọ.
We do not know how, and we do not want to know.	A ko mọ bawo, ati pe a ko fẹ lati mọ.
They are not coming to you anymore.	Wọn ko wa si ọ mọ.
Impossible, we think.	Ko ṣee ṣe, a ro.
His mother took him to the doctor after the doctor.	Iya rẹ mu u lọ si dokita lẹhin dokita.
It was obtained from his mother.	O ti gba lati ọdọ iya rẹ.
One way is to explain.	Ọna kan ni lati ṣe alaye.
Fun to be with.	Fun lati wa pẹlu.
Last summer, three women came out on the water.	Igba ooru to kọja, awọn obinrin mẹta jade lori omi.
I had to think about everything it touched.	Mo ni lati ronu nipa ohun gbogbo ti o fi ọwọ kan.
That is a good thing.	Eyi to dara niyẹn.
But they were wrong.	Ṣugbọn wọn ṣe aṣiṣe.
It is one of a kind.	O jẹ ọkan ninu iru kan.
This is where you go.	Eyi ni ibi ti o lọ.
It is near here.	O wa nitosi ibi.
It feels great.	O ro nla.
They essentially can not be easy.	Wọn ṣe pataki ko le rọrun.
In fact, we know.	Ni otitọ, a mọ.
He is not a child.	Oun kii ṣe ọmọde.
Must be included.	Gbọdọ ni ninu.
Maybe this time things will work out better.	Boya ni akoko yii awọn nkan yoo ṣiṣẹ daradara.
Fast, but not fast enough.	O yara, ṣugbọn ko yara to.
This will not work.	Eyi kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
Another week or two will not hurt.	Ọsẹ miiran tabi meji kii yoo ṣe ipalara.
No matter what they try they can not start.	Ko si ohun ti wọn gbiyanju wọn ko le bẹrẹ.
The name of this subject has changed over time.	Orukọ ẹkọ yii ti yipada ni akoko pupọ.
You can hear it here.	O le gbọ nibi.
It makes a statement.	O ṣe alaye kan.
He almost died on the work table.	O fẹrẹ ku lori tabili iṣẹ.
If not, do them now.	Ti o ko ba ṣe, ṣe wọn ni bayi.
They are, however, not the only way.	Wọn jẹ, sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe ọna nikan nikan.
They just want to sell the material so they can see it used.	Wọn fẹ lati ta ohun elo nikan ki wọn rii pe o lo.
She is not very happy.	Inu rẹ ko dun pupọ.
I love you most when you are angry, you say.	Mo nifẹ rẹ julọ nigbati o binu, o ti sọ.
My time has come.	Akoko mi ti de.
This is what has come to him.	Eyi ni ohun ti o ti de fun u.
There is so much you can say.	Pupọ wa ti o le sọ.
He was the last to leave the room.	Oun ni o kẹhin lati lọ kuro ni yara naa.
They never said a word.	Wọn ko sọ ọrọ kan rara.
It’s not that you have to most of them.	Kii ṣe pe o ni si ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn.
Read the article.	Ka nkan naa.
Do not be afraid!	Maṣe bẹru!
I just can't see why it doesn't work here.	Mo kan ko le rii idi ti ko ṣiṣẹ nibi.
I mean, he didn’t even ask me about it at all.	Mo tumọ si, ko paapaa beere lọwọ mi nipa rẹ rara.
It will not be a problem.	Kii yoo jẹ iṣoro.
In the end, it makes everyone better.	Ni ipari, o jẹ ki gbogbo eniyan dara julọ.
That's enough.	O ti to.
That has been the case for a long time.	Iyẹn ti wa fun igba pipẹ.
He hopes it will come.	O nireti pe yoo wa.
He will also do much better.	Oun yoo tun ṣe dara julọ ju pupọ lọ.
At the very least, it should not be as it should be.	O kere ju, kii ṣe bii o yẹ ki o jẹ.
Clean water.	Omi ti o mọ.
He is not the child he needs to be.	Oun kii ṣe ọmọ ti o nilo lati jẹ.
He turned to his father.	O yipada si baba rẹ.
You are reading this book.	O n ka iwe yii.
However, that would mean less money for him.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn yoo tumọ si owo kekere fun u.
We can not.	A ko le.
As soon as we arrived we would go to the beach.	Ni kete ti a ba de a yoo lọ si eti okun.
He got into bed.	O gba sinu ibusun.
That is not enough.	Iyẹn ko tun to.
That goes well.	Iyẹn lọ daradara.
Life is not about me, it is about others.	Igbesi aye kii ṣe nipa mi, o jẹ nipa awọn miiran.
I turned my head to the side to look at him.	Mo yi ori mi si ẹgbẹ lati wo i.
At least here nothing has changed.	O kere ju nibi ko si ohun ti o yipada.
Home is amazing.	Ile jẹ iyanu.
They had spoken three days before.	Wọn ti sọrọ ni ọjọ mẹta ṣaaju.
To understand this is important because without it we could not understand ourselves.	Lati loye eyi ṣe pataki nitori laisi iyẹn a ko le loye ara wa.
You sit here with him.	O joko nibi pẹlu rẹ.
It's over.	O ti kọja.
Save your hours.	Gba awọn wakati rẹ.
It means to be.	O tumọ si lati jẹ.
What is your opinion?	Kini ero rẹ?
Can not.	Ko le.
But that also makes sense.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn tun jẹ oye.
The head has no name.	Ori ko ni orukọ.
No amount of cleaning can restore it.	Ko si iye ti ninu le mu pada ti o.
Good weather conditions help.	Awọn ipo oju ojo to dara ṣe iranlọwọ.
As your life ends.	Bi aye re ti pari.
I am dropped.	Mo wa silẹ.
The buses are full to capacity.	Awọn ọkọ akero naa kun si agbara.
I hope it can take some time for you.	Mo nireti pe o le gba akoko diẹ fun ọ.
Tell them, be friends.	Sọ fun wọn, jẹ ọrẹ.
Grandpa is here.	Baba baba wa nibi.
You will get to meet your friends.	O yoo gba lati pade awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
I had no idea they were there.	Emi ko mọ pe wọn wa nibẹ.
Maybe that string pulled out some of his understanding.	Boya okun yẹn fa diẹ ninu oye rẹ jade.
At least we have that.	O kere ju a ni iyẹn.
I heard about it yesterday.	Mo ti gbọ nipa rẹ lana.
You go out on your own.	O jade lọ funrararẹ.
And nothing happened.	Ati pe ko si nkan ti o ṣẹlẹ.
They all know that their last time has come.	Gbogbo wọn mọ pe akoko ikẹhin wọn ti de.
So that has changed.	Nitorina eyi ti yipada.
I believe there is room for it.	Mo gbagbọ pe aaye wa fun.
I will never be in this store again.	Emi ko tun wa sinu ile itaja yii mọ.
It has many faces, but people live a simple life here.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn oju, ṣugbọn awọn eniyan n gbe igbesi aye ti o rọrun nibi.
I'm not really worried about it.	Emi ko ni aniyan nipa rẹ gaan.
Love that he wants to do anything with me.	Ni ife ti o fe lati se ohunkohun pẹlu mi.
I do not remember what he said.	Emi ko ranti ohun ti o sọ.
But that will wait until we get back from our work.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn yoo duro titi ti a yoo fi pada lati iṣẹ wa.
They stop before the game.	Wọn da duro ṣaaju ere.
We held hands in the water.	A di ọwọ mu ninu omi.
Men were so simple.	Awọn ọkunrin wà ki o rọrun.
It is what we do and how we think.	O jẹ ohun ti a ṣe ati bi a ṣe ro.
Tell your friends !.	Sọ fun awọn ọrẹ rẹ!.
This road should have been completed by now.	Opopona yii yẹ ki o ti pari ni bayi.
And everyone here agrees.	Ati gbogbo eniyan nibi gba.
Everyone wants to be around her.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ lati wa ni ayika rẹ.
This is a true story.	Eyi jẹ otitọ itan.
They have very little hands.	Wọn ni ọwọ ti kii ṣe ọwọ pupọ.
But he was human.	Sugbon o je eniyan.
Feel better this morning.	Lero dara ni owurọ yi.
I have already seen.	Mo ti rii tẹlẹ.
I missed that thing.	Mo padanu ohun yẹn.
It will be a better world.	Yoo jẹ aye ti o dara julọ.
It began to rise to us.	O bẹrẹ si ga soke si wa.
And his father was as passionate about it as he was ever.	Ati pe baba rẹ ni ife gidigidi nipa rẹ bi ko ṣe ri rara.
I can't be there today.	Mi o le ni nibẹ loni.
I do not know why or when.	Nko mo idi tabi nigbawo.
You have received a new status.	O ti gba ni ipo tuntun.
It would have meant my work.	Yoo ti tumọ si iṣẹ mi.
They know you are the best there.	Wọn mọ pe o dara julọ nibẹ.
I'm on it.	Mo wa lori re.
I need to be there.	Mo nilo lati wa nibẹ.
Most of them never left their room.	Ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn ko kuro ni yara wọn.
We missed it.	A padanu rẹ.
That is not right.	Iyẹn ko tọ.
You never see me again.	O ko wo mi lẹẹkansi.
We also know the way they go.	A tun mọ ọna ti wọn lọ.
There should be a lot more.	O yẹ ki o wa ọpọlọpọ diẹ sii.
There is little more to it.	Nibẹ ni kekere diẹ si o.
You should go down, show yourself.	O yẹ ki o lọ si isalẹ, fi ara rẹ han.
Forget, and forget tonight this ever happened.	Gbagbe, ki o gbagbe alẹ yi lailai ṣẹlẹ.
Please add your name and city.	Jọwọ fi orukọ ati ilu rẹ kun.
I went to your site but you were not there.	Mo lọ si aaye rẹ ṣugbọn iwọ ko si nibẹ.
Get it, and it could be a good year.	Gba, ati pe o le jẹ ọdun ti o dara.
You have heard this word a lot.	O ti gbọ ọrọ yii pupọ.
But you will be on the right track.	Ṣugbọn iwọ yoo wa ni ọna ti o tọ.
There are two main observations.	Awọn akiyesi akọkọ meji wa.
Try to make her happy.	Gbiyanju lati jẹ ki inu rẹ dun.
But whatever you do, you must always do.	Ṣugbọn ohunkohun ti o ba ṣe, o gbọdọ ṣe nigbagbogbo.
They have grown to know each other better.	Wọn ti dagba lati mọ ara wọn daradara.
They are all gone.	Gbogbo wọn ti lọ.
I can't wait to see you.	Nko le duro lati ri e.
A big problem.	Iṣoro nla kan.
I have not decided my heart yet.	Emi ko tii pinnu ọkan mi sibẹsibẹ.
He will not let that happen.	Oun ko ni jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
These songs used to have an ear.	Awọn orin wọnyi lo lati ni eti.
Get something to let it come back, maybe.	Gba nkan lati jẹ ki o pada wa, boya.
What you hear is music.	Ohun ti o gbọ ti jẹ orin.
She lives beautifully nearby.	O n gbe lẹwa nitosi.
They do not know anyone.	Won o mo enikeni.
Tell her you are there for your daughter.	Sọ fun u pe o wa fun ọmọbirin rẹ.
We need to stick with these kinds of things.	A nilo lati duro pẹlu iru awọn nkan wọnyi.
I mean to get you one.	Mo tumọ si lati gba ọ kan.
He hasn’t picked it up, so he doesn’t have either.	Ko ti gbe e soke, nitorina ko ni boya.
They will hit me seriously right now.	Wọn yoo lu mi ni pataki ni bayi.
In this case it is correct.	Ninu eyi o tọ.
Not for me.	Kii ṣe fun mi.
I do not know whether and when we will get married.	Emi ko mọ boya ati nigba ti a yoo ṣe igbeyawo.
They may even ask you to help them.	Wọn le paapaa beere lọwọ rẹ lati ran wọn lọwọ.
They help but not much.	Wọn ṣe iranlọwọ ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ.
Some children do not learn to read and write.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọde ko kọ ẹkọ lati ka ati kọ.
He will stay.	Oun yoo duro.
She wants it, needs to touch it.	O fe rẹ, nilo lati fi ọwọ kan rẹ.
And it has been very difficult.	Ati pe o ti le pupọ.
The blind man looks at his watch.	Arakunrin ti ko ni oju naa n wo aago rẹ.
I can't believe it.	Emi ko le gbagbọ rẹ.
I will not hurt your sister.	Emi yoo ko ipalara arabinrin rẹ.
They want us to use.	Wọn fẹ ki a lo.
I just work here.	Mo kan ṣiṣẹ nibi.
You may not want to eat.	O le ma fẹ lati jẹ.
And these are for you.	Ati pe awọn wọnyi wa fun ọ.
You have a view of anxiety about it.	O ni a wo ti aniyan nipa rẹ.
It's the best there.	O dara julọ nibẹ.
It will pull through.	O yoo fa nipasẹ.
Just another day at the office, boys.	O kan ọjọ miiran ni ọfiisi, awọn ọmọkunrin.
But nothing to see.	Sugbon ko si nkankan lati ri.
The conclusion is surprising.	Awọn ipari jẹ iyalẹnu.
I am interested in such things.	Mo nifẹ si iru awọn nkan bẹẹ.
And we are.	Ati pe wa.
For more.	Fun diẹ.
This may help him realize that this is your home.	Eyi le ṣe iranlọwọ fun u lati mọ pe eyi ni ile rẹ.
Please know that you will be in my heart forever.	Jọwọ mọ pe iwọ yoo wa ninu ọkan mi lailai.
I have with me.	Mo ni pẹlu mi.
Everyone makes this mistake at some point.	Gbogbo eniyan ṣe aṣiṣe yii ni aaye kan.
Something caught my eye.	Nkankan mu oju mi.
It used to live up there.	O lo lati gbe soke nibẹ.
You have to keep it.	O ni lati tọju rẹ.
I will not ask you.	Emi kii yoo beere lọwọ rẹ.
And one night he had so much to drink.	Ati ni alẹ ọjọ kan o ni pupọ lati mu.
Work with me.	Ṣiṣẹ pẹlu mi.
But it is good to remember sometimes.	Ṣugbọn o dara lati ranti nigba miiran.
I know you just want what is best for you.	Mo mọ pe o kan fẹ ohun ti o dara julọ fun ọ.
Police have been searching the home of the missing man.	Awọn ọlọpa ti wa ile ọkunrin ti o padanu naa.
It is only high when no water is used.	O ga nikan nigbati ko si omi ti a lo.
All in all.	Gbogbo ni akoko.
Well worth the walk.	Daradara tọ awọn rin.
He didn’t try to tell me it would be okay.	Ko gbiyanju lati sọ fun mi pe yoo dara.
That is the story they want everyone to know.	Iyẹn ni itan ti wọn fẹ ki gbogbo eniyan mọ.
Not so in the plane.	Ko ri bẹ ninu ọkọ ofurufu.
I know, you say football.	Mo mọ, o sọ bọọlu.
I know what people want to drink.	Mo mọ ohun ti eniyan fẹ lati mu.
I told myself just to think high.	Mo ti so fun ara mi o kan lati ro ga.
You may have crossed your legs at that point.	O le ti kọja awọn ẹsẹ rẹ ni aaye yẹn.
This has nothing to do with performance.	Eyi ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu ṣiṣe.
I hope you are right.	Mo nireti pe o tọ.
He wants to move again.	O fe lati tun gbe.
It turned out well.	O wa jade daradara.
Not a very good place.	Kii ṣe ibi ti o dara pupọ.
And no one heard anything.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti o gbọ nkan kan.
You can feel so well.	O le lero bẹ daradara.
The rain came and went.	Ojo ba de o si lọ.
It has to be completely.	O ni lati jẹ patapata.
He is also not sure about it.	O tun ko ni idaniloju nipa rẹ.
Remember who you are as a child.	Ranti ẹni ti o jẹ bi ọmọde.
Do not do my work for me.	Maṣe ṣe iṣẹ mi fun mi.
Wrong to talk about.	Ko tọ lati sọrọ nipa.
Get your home value now !.	Gba iye ile rẹ ni bayi!.
It is a thing of the past.	O jẹ ohun ti o ti kọja.
But the days are long gone.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọjọ ti o ti kọja.
I will not say if you do not.	Emi kii yoo sọ ti o ko ba ṣe.
Come on, we'll be late.	Wa, a yoo pẹ.
Sometimes, they will sit for most of the day.	Nigba miiran, wọn yoo joko fun pupọ julọ ọjọ naa.
Here, try now.	Nibi, gbiyanju ni bayi.
That is the wrong word.	Ọrọ ti ko tọ niyẹn.
It makes books end up being hard.	O mu ki awọn iwe pari ni lile.
Sometimes this works, and sometimes this doesn’t.	Nigba miiran eyi ṣiṣẹ, ati nigba miiran eyi kii ṣe.
He introduced me to his sister.	O ṣe mi si arabinrin rẹ.
See what you have to say below.	Wo ohun ti o ni lati sọ ni isalẹ.
I lost everything.	Mo padanu ohun gbogbo.
The sister did not.	Arabinrin ko da.
I don’t want to work for anyone else.	Emi ko fẹ lati ṣiṣẹ fun ẹnikẹni miiran.
You can be better.	O le dara julọ.
They took me.	Wọn gba mi.
I do not know where we are now.	Emi ko mọ ibiti a wa ni bayi.
We have to come back and finish the job.	A ni lati pada ki a pari iṣẹ naa.
That will not be difficult to do.	Iyẹn kii yoo nira lati ṣe.
Now most applications will not open.	Bayi ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun elo kii yoo ṣii.
He gave them to you because he loved you.	O fi wọn fun ọ nitori o nifẹ rẹ.
Again, teachers seem to be selling themselves on foot.	Lẹẹkansi, awọn olukọ dabi ẹni pe wọn n ta ara wọn ni ẹsẹ.
You are not going to sleep.	O ko ni lọ lati sun.
Your help is available, but below.	Awọn iranlọwọ rẹ wa, ṣugbọn isalẹ.
You have words for.	O ni awọn ọrọ fun.
Now, first, you have to wash your hair.	Bayi, akọkọ, o ni lati wẹ irun rẹ.
No one was killed.	A ko pa enikeni.
I went back downstairs.	Mo pada si isalẹ.
I think it will work.	Mo ro pe yoo ṣiṣẹ.
Nothing else is used.	Ko si ohun miiran lo.
You have no plans.	O ko ni eto kan.
It’s on my way.	O wa ni ọna mi.
One advantage, that is.	Anfani kan, iyẹn ni.
I will write as soon as possible.	Emi yoo kọ ni kete bi o ti ṣee.
Come on in.	Wa lori ati.
I did not say.	Emi ko sọ mi.
A small tree sits on them.	Igi igi kekere kan joko lori wọn.
He is always looking for me.	O n wa mi nigbagbogbo.
It hit my heart.	O lu inu ọkan mi.
They can mean something or something.	Wọn le tumọ nkankan tabi nkankan.
Words like them, them, and there.	Awọn ọrọ bii wọn, wọn, ati nibẹ.
I hope to see you there.	Mo nireti lati rii nibẹ.
I can and will.	Mo le ati ki o yoo.
No intelligent person enjoyed it.	Ko si eniyan ti o ni oye ti o gbadun rẹ.
They don’t have one in it.	Wọn ko ni ọkan ninu rẹ.
The least you can do is help him.	Ohun ti o kere julọ ti o le ṣe ni iranlọwọ fun u.
I want services to help them get away with help.	Mo fẹ awọn iṣẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun wọn lati lọ kuro ni iranlọwọ.
Just don’t get it.	O kan ko gba.
Just sweet, sweet, sweet.	O kan dun, dun, dun.
She was afraid to feel this way.	O bẹru rẹ lati lero ni ọna yii.
This will be even more difficult.	Kii yoo paapaa nira paapaa.
She has found her husband.	O ti ri ọkọ rẹ.
I started to understand that about it.	Mo bẹrẹ lati ni oye iyẹn nipa rẹ.
So wrong.	Nitorina ko tọ si.
Long, long ago, times changed.	Ni pipẹ, igba pipẹ sẹhin, awọn akoko yipada.
Our main purpose is to tell the truth.	Idi pataki wa ni lati sọ otitọ.
I’ve let a lot of things go.	Mo ti jẹ ki ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan lọ.
I am not sure if it is possible at this point.	Emi ko rii daju boya o ṣee ṣe ni aaye yii.
Added.	Ti fi kun.
In a word, it is up.	Ninu ọrọ kan, o jẹ oke.
And the phone, at the same time.	Ati foonu, ni akoko kanna.
I do not know how to handle it.	Emi ko mo bi o lati mu o.
Don't let them take me away again.	Maṣe jẹ ki wọn tun gbe mi lọ.
They are high.	Wọn ga.
It is a very interesting class.	O ti wa ni a gidigidi awon kilasi.
They always ask you for more money.	Wọn nigbagbogbo beere lọwọ rẹ fun owo diẹ sii.
I can be on the plane tomorrow.	Mo le wa lori ọkọ ofurufu ni ọla.
If my father feared him away.	Ti baba mi bẹru rẹ kuro.
Must have called too late.	Gbọdọ ti pe pẹ ju.
That is no accident.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ijamba.
In the past, important urban activities were taking place.	Ni igba atijọ, awọn iṣẹ ilu pataki ti wa ni ibi.
It's breakfast.	O jẹ ounjẹ owurọ.
He did not wear shoes.	O ko bata bata.
People like to finish things off.	Eniyan fẹran lati pari awọn nkan.
But this gives us a way to break out.	Ṣugbọn eyi fun wa ni ọna lati ya jade.
They sit in a small house on the roof.	Wọn joko ni ile kekere lori oke.
There is nothing personal in it.	Ko si ohun ti ara ẹni ninu rẹ.
He will.	Oun yoo.
I'm trying to do the same thing.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ṣe ohun kanna.
You just want to go beyond that too.	O kan fẹ lati kọja eyi pẹlu.
In the back of his mind, he knew why.	Ni ẹhin ọkan rẹ, o mọ idi.
Most sites require only two questions.	Pupọ awọn aaye nilo awọn ibeere meji nikan.
I can't leave it.	Emi ko le fi i silẹ.
You have to give it to him.	O ni lati fi fun u.
That's not him.	Iyẹn kii ṣe oun.
Maybe even a small group.	Boya paapaa ẹgbẹ kekere kan.
Okay, dinner you and I just enjoyed it.	O dara, ounjẹ alẹ iwọ ati emi kan dun si mi.
You may need it.	O le nilo rẹ.
Winter in the garden is the holiday season.	Igba otutu ninu ọgba jẹ akoko isinmi.
She was very upset to find the car and she knew it.	O binu pupọ lati wa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ati pe o mọ ọ.
I will finish.	Emi yoo pari.
I can't think of good reasons.	Nko le ronu nipa awọn idi to dara.
Of course it comes from one.	Dajudaju o wa lati inu ọkan.
I ate my meal.	Mo jẹ ounjẹ mi.
I have had little interest in the past.	Mo ni kekere anfani ni awọn ti o ti kọja.
Either way, it seems to be on its way.	Ọna boya, o dabi pe o wa ni ọna rẹ.
My eyes!	Oju mi!
Leave your clothes on as you return.	Fi aṣọ rẹ silẹ bi o ṣe n pada wa.
But there is a serious problem with this information.	Ṣugbọn iṣoro pataki kan wa pẹlu alaye yii.
But of course not.	Ṣugbọn dajudaju kii ṣe bẹ.
I just might need to see it.	Mo kan le nilo lati ri i.
He refuses to believe their story.	O kọ lati gbagbọ itan wọn.
There are only two.	Awọn meji nikan ni.
Or he wouldn’t really want to know.	Tabi oun yoo ko gan fẹ lati mọ.
Now you feel better.	Bayi o lero dara.
Perhaps no child was lost.	Boya ko si ọmọ ti o padanu.
And it really took over.	Ati awọn ti o gan mu lori.
If you don’t, you could still break into the industry.	Ti o ko ba ṣe bẹ, o tun le fọ sinu ile-iṣẹ naa.
Everything is there.	Ohun gbogbo wa nibẹ.
We all want to feel that we are.	Gbogbo wa fẹ lati lero pe a wa.
There are probably two reasons for this.	Boya idi meji lo wa fun iyẹn.
Go to a restaurant with a friend and take care of them.	Lọ si ounjẹ pẹlu ọrẹ kan ki o tọju wọn.
I don’t have any better.	Emi ko ni eyikeyi dara julọ.
It must have changed from another city.	O gbọdọ ti yipada lati ilu miiran.
I also don’t know if there are any house rules.	Emi ko tun mọ boya awọn ofin ile eyikeyi wa.
It’s true, though.	O jẹ otitọ, paapaa.
What a past life in this little spiritual hour.	Kini igbesi aye ti o kọja ni wakati kekere ti emi yii.
Consider the same company.	Ṣe akiyesi ile-iṣẹ kanna.
We talk about it.	A sọrọ nipa rẹ.
This book is so hard, but not hard.	Iwe yi je ki lile, sugbon ko lile.
There is a problem and something has to change.	Iṣoro kan wa ati pe nkan kan ni lati yipada.
Only their hands touched.	Nikan ọwọ wọn fi ọwọ kan.
Please can anyone help me on this.	Jọwọ ṣe ẹnikẹni le ran mi lọwọ lori eyi.
No one has seen the boy since.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ti ri ọmọkunrin naa lati igba naa.
There is no way to say until it is too late.	Ko si ọna lati sọ titi o fi pẹ ju.
It’s something that happens when you’re new as a team.	O jẹ nkan ti o ṣẹlẹ nigbati o jẹ tuntun bi ẹgbẹ kan.
Your feet are in position.	Ẹsẹ rẹ wa ni ipo.
I looked into the thought.	Mo ti wo inu ero naa.
He did not.	Ko ṣe e.
Not the same thing.	Kii ṣe ohun kanna.
Or two if you like.	Tabi meji ti o ba fẹ.
No it is the right one.	Rara o jẹ ọkan ti o tọ.
I have to think of something else.	Mo ni lati ronu nkan miiran.
She is married with her first child, a little boy.	O ti ni iyawo pẹlu ọmọ akọkọ rẹ, ọmọkunrin kekere kan.
But this is a lot more.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ pupọ diẹ sii.
You have to wait to pick it up.	O ni lati duro lati gbe e soke.
We need to get their attention.	A nilo lati gba akiyesi wọn.
But just a little.	Sugbon o kan kekere kan.
Keep them.	Pa wọn mọ́.
I just want to know how it is doing today.	Mo kan fẹ lati mọ bi o ṣe n ṣe loni.
At the very least, no one deserves to be able to.	O kere ju, ko si ẹnikan ti o yẹ lati ni anfani lati.
I was anxious at this time last year.	Mo ni aniyan ni akoko yii ni ọdun to kọja.
They have one person now.	Wọn ni eniyan kan ni bayi.
It asks a simple question.	O beere ibeere ti o rọrun.
This is your life.	Eyi ni aye rẹ.
Life here can be quite interesting.	Aye nibi le jẹ ohun awon.
And he hated me.	O si korira mi.
He never thought to ask about it.	Ko ronu rara lati beere nipa rẹ.
She began to laugh.	O bẹrẹ si rẹrin.
So he decided to take the day off and go.	Nitorina o pinnu lati gba ọjọ naa o si lọ.
Don't forget that you want to get the things you really want.	Maṣe gbagbe pe o fẹ lati gba awọn nkan ti o fẹ gaan fun ọ.
I hit her from the back.	Mo ba a lati ẹhin.
Maybe, you have nothing to lose.	Boya, o ko ni nkankan lati padanu.
You know that man.	O mọ ọkunrin yẹn.
It was a good one.	O je kan ti o dara.
No one understands what is happening.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o loye ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
He raised his eyes to me.	O gbe oju rẹ soke si mi.
We didn’t talk much.	A ko sọrọ pupọ.
I have a month to change things.	Mo ni oṣu kan lati yi awọn nkan pada.
You always look your best for celebrations.	O nigbagbogbo wo ohun ti o dara julọ fun awọn ayẹyẹ.
It’s a gift, you want to say.	O jẹ ẹbun, o fẹ sọ.
But they can learn.	Ṣugbọn wọn le kọ ẹkọ.
A whole new world for me.	Gbogbo aye tuntun fun mi.
Nothing in it yet.	Ko si nkankan ninu rẹ sibẹsibẹ.
This is not your one.	Eyi kii ṣe ọkan rẹ.
Lu mi soke.	Lu mi soke.
I was the only one who died.	Emi nikan ni o ku.
I often read the book.	Igba igba ni mo ka iwe naa.
The child did not come back.	Ọmọ naa ko pada wa.
Yours is not yet available.	Tirẹ ko tii wa.
We live in a world where everything happens fast for us.	A n gbe ni a aye ibi ti ohun gbogbo ṣẹlẹ sare fun wa.
I have learned ways to.	Mo ti kọ awọn ọna lati.
I am not at home.	Emi ko si ni ile.
Fortunately, no injuries.	O da, ko si awọn ipalara.
Go get it.	Lọ gba a.
If you do not want to, do not.	Ti o ko ba fẹ, ma ṣe.
He was angry when he touched me.	O binu nigbati o fi ọwọ kan mi.
All this is just words, only words.	Gbogbo eyi jẹ ọrọ nikan, awọn ọrọ nikan.
In fact, it is my job.	Ni otitọ, iṣẹ mi ni.
No, that is not true.	Rara, iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
For most of us, it is always.	Fun pupọ julọ wa, o jẹ nigbagbogbo.
That is surprising.	Iyalẹnu niyẹn.
I think everyone enjoyed it.	Mo ro pe gbogbo eniyan gbadun rẹ.
There are people here who want to help.	Awọn eniyan wa nibi ti o fẹ ṣe iranlọwọ.
You may have missed something.	O le ti padanu nkankan.
But if they do not.	Sugbon ti won ba ko.
Do not use hot water.	Maṣe lo omi gbona.
Of course you can only get better.	Dajudaju o le dara julọ nikan.
He wanted it, and he was alone.	O fẹ rẹ, ati pe oun nikan.
She was scared.	O bẹru.
I want people to understand the story behind it.	Mo fẹ ki awọn eniyan ni oye itan lẹhin rẹ.
But it is so.	Sugbon o ti ri bẹ.
I saw in your room this morning.	Mo ti ri ninu yara rẹ owurọ yi.
He spent an hour visiting his sister.	O lo wakati kan lati ṣabẹwo si arabinrin rẹ.
And he also went to school.	Ati pe o tun lọ si ile-iwe.
But they are not easy at all.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko rọrun rara.
That's what I did.	Ohun ti mo ṣe niyẹn.
Water brought from groundwater.	Omi ti a mu wa lati inu omi inu ile.
It has been happening since she was a girl.	O ti n ṣẹlẹ lati igba ti o jẹ ọmọbirin.
I feel it every minute.	Mo lero o gbogbo iṣẹju.
I hope this helps.	Mo nireti pe eyi ṣe iranlọwọ.
But not much as people say.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ bi eniyan ṣe sọ.
I asked for nothing.	Mo beere fun ohunkohun.
I was too tired to be wrong, he thought.	O rẹ mi pupọ lati jẹ aṣiṣe, o ro.
So sorry about that.	Nitorina binu nipa iyẹn.
At least not for people.	O kere kii ṣe fun eniyan.
Buy their books.	Ra awọn iwe wọn.
I will never forget.	Emi ko ni gbagbe.
He has enjoyed the best time of his career.	O ti gbadun akoko ti o dara julọ ti iṣẹ rẹ.
It is already here.	O ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
Anything more than you want!	Eyikeyi diẹ sii ju ti o fẹ!
I'm serious.	Mo n ṣe pataki.
No need.	Ko nilo.
They do not take away our energy.	Wọn ko gba agbara wa kuro.
The men are tired.	Awọn ọkunrin ti wa ni re.
This is what happened.	Ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni eyi.
He left his tea.	O fi tii rẹ silẹ.
But the idea is older than that.	Ṣugbọn imọran ti dagba ju iyẹn lọ.
Not sure.	Ko da a loju.
Or the past.	Tabi awọn ti o ti kọja.
Wake up and help stop !.	Ji ki o ṣe iranlọwọ lati da duro!.
We arrived at his house.	A de ile rẹ.
Nothing you do will last.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣe yoo pẹ.
The rules of the game are simple.	Awọn ofin ti awọn ere ni o rọrun.
It is not something you can buy.	Kii ṣe nkan ti o le ra.
It is the ultimate love.	O jẹ ifẹ ikẹhin.
You know it can be hard for a person.	O mọ pe o le jẹ lile fun eniyan.
I know that face.	Mo mọ oju yẹn.
We have come a long way.	A ti wa ọna pipẹ.
Her mother should be at home now.	Iya rẹ yẹ ki o wa ni ile ni bayi.
They go for a bath.	Wọn lọ fun wẹ.
It took a long time, and he let it out.	O si mu gun gun, o si jẹ ki o jade.
You wish you had more time to read.	O fẹ pe o ni akoko diẹ sii lati ka.
You need rest more than anything else.	O nilo isinmi ju ohunkohun miiran lọ.
There's a lot you don't talk about.	Nibẹ ni a pupo ti o ko sọrọ nipa.
You have something else.	O ni nkan miiran.
Get out of my way.	Jade kuro ni ọna mi.
But people have to eat.	Ṣugbọn awọn eniyan ni lati jẹun.
Most of them have no shoes.	Pupọ ninu wọn ko ni bata.
Or at least it could be.	Tabi o kere ju o le jẹ.
It just needs time.	O kan nilo akoko.
Some of it you will.	Diẹ ninu rẹ iwọ yoo.
That's for sure.	Iyẹn daju.
It looks like me.	O dabi emi.
He’s the kind of person most people don’t notice.	O jẹ iru eniyan ti ọpọlọpọ eniyan ko ṣe akiyesi.
He learned hard for his exams.	O kọ ẹkọ lile fun awọn idanwo rẹ.
Ask how their children like the seats.	Beere bi awọn ọmọ wọn ṣe fẹran awọn ijoko.
His words changed at that time.	Ọrọ rẹ yipada ni akoko yẹn.
It seems to me alone, without special.	O dabi emi nikan, laisi pataki.
Your last chance is gone.	Rẹ kẹhin anfani ti lọ.
This is my life.	Eyi ni aye mi.
They went with him.	Wọn lọ pẹlu rẹ.
They will all be killed.	Gbogbo wọn ni yoo pa.
The girls who work there love me very much.	Awọn ọmọbirin ti o ṣiṣẹ nibẹ fẹran mi pupọ.
It is very easy to do.	O rọrun pupọ lati ṣe.
I walked downstairs.	Mo rin si isalẹ.
A lot of life has happened to him.	Ọpọlọpọ igbesi aye ti ṣẹlẹ si i.
No large or small equipment needed.	Ko si ohun elo nla tabi kekere ti o nilo.
A father can only appear once in a while.	Baba kan le han nikan ni akoko kan.
You will not have to wait for hours and days.	Iwọ kii yoo ni lati duro fun awọn wakati ati awọn ọjọ.
Get out of power.	Lọ kuro ni agbara.
You go and start and explain it.	O lọ ki o bẹrẹ ati ṣe alaye rẹ.
No world is worth more than another.	Ko si aye jẹ tọ diẹ sii ju miiran.
The boy hated them.	Ọmọkunrin naa korira wọn.
They need to move.	Wọn nilo lati gbe.
It is the same information.	Alaye kanna ni.
Write the word.	Kọ ọrọ naa.
I do not see any error.	Emi ko ri aṣiṣe.
Wash hands thoroughly.	Fọ ọwọ daradara.
So they put him on the table.	Nitorina wọn gbe e kuro lori tabili.
We don't see one here.	A ko ri ọkan nibi.
Most of them pass both houses.	Ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn kọja awọn ile mejeeji.
This is called the first test mode.	A pe eyi ni ipo idanwo akọkọ.
You don’t like it, wear something else.	O ko fẹran rẹ, wọ nkan miiran.
They will meet again.	Ti won yoo pade lẹẹkansi.
You can tell by the way you handle it.	O le sọ nipa ọna ti o ṣe mu u.
I can go where you can not.	Mo le lọ si ibi ti o le ma.
Give him time, he will stand up.	Fun u akoko, o yoo duro soke.
I'm not really sure.	Emi ko da mi loju gaan.
Or the last.	Tabi awọn ti o kẹhin.
But there is a reason for this.	Ṣugbọn idi kan wa fun eyi.
No word needed.	Ko si ọrọ ti o nilo.
The law has been written for us.	A ti kọ ofin fun wa.
He seemed not afraid of anything.	O dabi pe ko bẹru ohunkohun.
Most everyone knows that life clothes are important in space.	Pupọ julọ gbogbo eniyan mọ pe awọn aṣọ aye jẹ pataki ni aaye.
Together, these people are hot.	Papọ, awọn eniyan wọnyi gbona.
He did not eat.	O ko jẹun.
Your game days are over.	Awọn ọjọ ere rẹ ti pari.
The work is not for tomorrow.	Iṣẹ naa kii ṣe fun ọla.
You will die in a few minutes.	Iwọ yoo ku ni iṣẹju diẹ.
You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.	O ko ni lati sọrọ nipa rẹ ti o ko ba fẹ.
And high.	Ati ki o ga.
This is where you should sit and eat.	Eyi ni ibiti o yẹ ki o joko ati jẹun.
You are the one who lifted it up!	Iwọ ni ẹniti o gbe e soke!
I can't miss work because it's too late.	Mi o le padanu iṣẹ nitori pe o pẹ.
I am dead.	Mo ti ku.
Anyone else we will have to send again.	Ẹnikẹni miiran ti a yoo ni lati tun ranṣẹ lẹẹkansi.
Never lose your sense of wonder.	Maṣe padanu ori iyalẹnu rẹ rara.
Those who know us best know that we love to be high.	Awọn ti o mọ wa julọ mọ pe a nifẹ lati ga.
You have to give birth to one.	O ni lati bi ọkan.
Just do your job, of course.	O kan ṣe iṣẹ rẹ, dajudaju.
Give me the right words to say at the right time.	Fun mi ni awọn ọrọ ti o tọ lati sọ ni akoko ti o tọ.
Water can freeze below a certain point.	Omi le di omi ni isalẹ aaye pataki kan.
I will be your wife.	Emi yoo jẹ iyawo rẹ.
Nothing contains the sun.	Ko si ohun ti o ni awọn oorun.
You may not have been a police officer.	O le ma ti jẹ ọlọpa.
But once he did, he had a friend for life.	Ṣugbọn ni kete ti o ṣe, o ni ọrẹ kan fun igbesi aye.
I’ve had a few problems lately, especially.	Mo ti ni awọn iṣoro diẹ laipẹ, paapaa.
Okay, you have two of them.	O dara, o ni meji ninu wọn.
Never again.	Ko lailai lẹẹkansi.
About the bad guys.	Nipa awọn eniyan buburu.
Maybe you do.	Boya o ṣe.
I do not keep my word to you.	Emi ko pa ọrọ mi mọ fun ọ.
My whole body went into it.	Gbogbo ara mi ti wọ inu rẹ.
I may be hurt or angry about this.	Mo le ni ipalara tabi binu lori eyi.
It's too hot.	O gbona gan.
He seems to be fine with it.	O dabi ẹni pe o dara pẹlu rẹ.
I think he will not change.	Mo ro pe oun ko ni yi pada.
The students are very nice.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe dara pupọ.
Tests are important in determining the best course of action.	Awọn idanwo jẹ pataki ni ipinnu ọna ti o dara julọ.
And that sounds like a lot to me.	Ati pe iyẹn dabi pupọ fun mi.
They have been removed.	Wọn ti yọ kuro.
This is only small, however.	Eyi jẹ kekere nikan, sibẹsibẹ.
Nothing, or it doesn’t seem to you that way.	Ko si nkankan, tabi ko dabi si ọ ni ọna yẹn.
This is the world we live in.	Eyi ni aye ti a gbe ni.
Drink if you must.	Mu ti o ba gbọdọ.
We promise nothing.	A ṣe ileri ohunkohun.
Let me explain what we mean by that.	Jẹ ki n ṣe alaye ohun ti a tumọ nipa iyẹn.
Buy your child's school.	Ṣe ifẹ si ile-iwe ọmọ rẹ.
It is not a house we are talking about.	Kii ṣe ile kan ti a n sọrọ nipa rẹ.
I don’t like this idea either.	Emi ko fẹran imọran yii boya.
Many of them have gone home.	Pupọ ninu wọn ti lọ si ile.
But what if.	Ṣugbọn kini ti o ba jẹ.
I thought, forget it, why do you remember such a thing.	Mo ro, gbagbe rẹ, kilode ti o ranti iru nkan bẹẹ.
They are like any other you have ever seen.	Wọn dabi eyikeyi miiran ti o ti ri.
I will buy more !.	Emi yoo ra diẹ sii!.
He didn't even go home.	Ko paapaa lọ si ile.
Not that week.	Kii ṣe ọsẹ yẹn.
You just need to know what’s going on.	O kan nilo lati mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
I’m with you on that.	Mo wa pẹlu rẹ lori iyẹn.
What a ?.	Kini a?.
But that seems unlikely.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn dabi pe ko ṣeeṣe.
He has no one.	Ko ni enikeni.
The company intends to recover all the proceeds.	Ile-iṣẹ naa ni ero lati gba gbogbo awọn owo ji pada.
Don't get me wrong.	Maṣe gba mi ni aṣiṣe.
When he has, he also climbs forward.	Nigbati o ni, o tun gun si iwaju.
That could be a big mistake.	Iyẹn le jẹ aṣiṣe nla kan.
He is dead.	O ti ku.
To tell me you love me.	Lati sọ fun mi pe o nifẹ mi.
It is as important first as the news.	O jẹ pataki akọkọ bi awọn iroyin.
We are not the only group to cut.	A kii ṣe ẹgbẹ nikan lati ge.
And in bed.	Ati ni ibusun.
But, wait a minute.	Ṣugbọn, duro iṣẹju kan.
Not easy, however.	Ko rọrun, sibẹsibẹ.
They promise a whole new body.	Wọn ṣe ileri gbogbo ara tuntun.
Don't think of that for a minute.	Maṣe ronu iyẹn fun iṣẹju kan.
You have to do what you have to do.	O ni lati ṣe ohun ti o ni lati ṣe.
They are not really mother material.	Wọn kii ṣe ohun elo iya gaan.
Both are very important to me.	Awọn mejeeji ṣe pataki pupọ si mi.
I want it seen everywhere by everyone.	Mo fẹ rẹ ri nibi gbogbo nipa gbogbo eniyan.
But just about anything goes now.	Sugbon o kan nipa ohunkohun lọ bayi.
There is also a possibility.	O ṣeeṣe kan tun wa.
It works for both.	O ṣiṣẹ fun awọn mejeeji.
Now my true face is gone.	Bayi oju otitọ mi ti lọ.
I have one last question.	Mo ni ibeere kan ti o kẹhin.
You may not be interested in this, and it is perfectly fine.	O le ko ni anfani ni yi, ati awọn ti o jẹ daradara dara.
Very good food and excellent room facilities.	Ounjẹ ti o dara pupọ ati awọn ohun elo yara dara julọ.
Think about it for a minute.	Ronu nipa rẹ fun iṣẹju kan.
What is your favorite food?	Kini ounjẹ ayanfẹ rẹ?
Please tell us how much you will receive.	Jọwọ sọ fun wa iye ti o yoo gba.
Find this and know.	Wa eyi ki o mọ.
Maybe he was the man he wanted.	Boya o jẹ ọkunrin ti o fẹ.
You can feel it.	O le lero rẹ.
And continue to like it.	Ati ki o tẹsiwaju lati fẹ rẹ.
Or do it in a couple of days.	Tabi o ṣe ni ọjọ meji kan.
They make no mistakes at all.	Wọn ko ṣe awọn aṣiṣe rara.
So he did.	Nitorina o ṣe.
There is no river near this city.	Ko si odo nitosi ilu yii.
You have your own ideas.	O ni awọn ero ti ara rẹ.
Do you have nothing else to do?	Ṣe o ko ni awọn nkan miiran lati ṣe?
However, it has to be something that does not change anything.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ni lati jẹ nkan ti ko yipada ohunkohun.
He is no longer the same person.	Ko si jẹ eniyan kanna mọ.
I look at what he did for the city.	Mo wo ohun ti o ṣe fun ilu naa.
Strap your back.	Fi okun si ẹhin rẹ.
You have your own ideas.	O ni awọn ero ti ara rẹ.
They understand that some bad things happened.	Wọn loye pe awọn ohun buburu kan ṣẹlẹ.
He has no money.	Ko ni owo.
Read more about this accident.	Ka diẹ sii nipa ijamba yii.
He never talked about working with her.	Ko sọrọ rara nipa ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
He didn’t want to think about that.	Ko fẹ lati ronu nipa iyẹn.
I did not hear the last one.	Emi ko gbọ ti o kẹhin.
You will hear what happens when everything goes wrong.	Iwọ yoo gbọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nigbati ohun gbogbo ba jẹ aṣiṣe.
When not done or lost.	Nigbati o ko ba se tabi nu.
I would not ask for such a thing.	Emi kii yoo beere fun iru nkan bẹẹ.
He obviously did a good job for the company.	O han gbangba pe o ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara fun ile-iṣẹ naa.
I don't have much money.	Emi ko ni owo pupọ.
Put them into my heart together.	Fi wọn sinu ọkan mi papọ.
Good for me too.	O dara fun mi paapaa.
I live near you.	Mo n gbe nitosi rẹ.
He will come to our place.	Yoo de si ipo wa.
They say something.	Wọn sọ nkankan.
Wait for a man to come home and love you.	Duro fun ọkunrin kan lati wa si ile ati ki o nifẹ rẹ.
You do not have to do everything.	O ko ni lati ṣe ohun gbogbo.
He saw the problem.	O ri iṣoro naa.
You see, there is still a lot.	Ṣe o rii, pupọ si tun wa.
Everything is fine.	Ohun gbogbo ti dara ju.
It started to look like he had died in error.	O bẹrẹ lati dabi pe o ti ku ni aṣiṣe.
They have power.	Won ni agbara.
We need to take care of ourselves, first.	A nilo lati tọju ara wa, akọkọ.
I have told everyone.	Mo ti sọ fun gbogbo eniyan.
This is the only road that goes into the city.	Eleyi jẹ nikan ni opopona ti o lọ sinu ilu.
Maybe even before that.	Boya paapaa ṣaaju iyẹn.
The sister did not know what she was looking for.	Arabinrin naa ko mọ ohun ti o n wa.
But he is in trouble.	Ṣugbọn o wa ninu wahala.
And very few people understand this.	Ati pupọ diẹ eniyan loye eyi.
He was lifted up.	A gbe e soke.
We’ve seen something like this before, of course.	A ti rii iru nkan bayi tẹlẹ, dajudaju.
It's just easy to be around.	O kan rọrun lati wa ni ayika.
But he did not move.	Sugbon ko gbe.
This however is not so much a problem.	Eyi sibẹsibẹ kii ṣe iṣoro pupọ.
So why do they?	Nitorina kilode ti wọn ṣe?
He is not the only man now.	Oun kii ṣe ọkunrin nikan ni bayi.
And better than that, he told her.	Ati pe o dara ju iyẹn lọ, o sọ fun u.
He spent all day making love.	O lo gbogbo ọjọ ti o ṣe ifẹ.
We were not given anything.	A ko fun wọn ni nkankan.
I do not give anything.	Nko fun ni nkankan.
That’s the best way to say, maybe.	Iyẹn ni ọna ti o dara julọ lati sọ, boya.
We will get that information when we need it.	A yoo gba alaye yẹn nigba ti a ba nilo rẹ.
He will be here.	Oun yoo wa nibi.
They hurt a little.	Wọn ṣe ipalara diẹ.
But that is great if it is.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ nla ti o ba jẹ.
Maybe the police are back.	Boya awọn ọlọpa ti pada.
He went on.	O si lọ lori.
Open your mind to new worlds.	Ṣii ọkan rẹ si awọn aye tuntun.
I will be back soon with the news.	Emi yoo pada wa laipẹ pẹlu awọn iroyin.
Enough fun and games.	To fun ati awọn ere.
Let’s do something similar here, he said.	Jẹ ki a ṣe iru nkan kan nibi, o sọ.
But feel something obvious do.	Ṣugbọn lero nkan ti o han gbangba ṣe.
Today, after a week, they are beautiful.	Loni, lẹhin ọsẹ kan, wọn lẹwa.
My whole life.	Gbogbo aye mi.
It has all the tools you need.	O ni gbogbo ohun elo ti o nilo.
Lots of thoughts going on in my head.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ero ti n lọ ni ori mi.
Here are some of the things we did.	Eyi ni diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ ti a ṣe.
I don’t want to end up on a mountain side.	Emi ko fẹ lati pari ni ẹgbẹ oke kan.
And he loves it.	Ati pe o nifẹ.
To know what is happening in my own home.	Lati mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ ninu ile ti ara mi.
They are not the kind of people who will hate you for it.	Wọn kii ṣe iru eniyan ti yoo korira rẹ nitori rẹ.
Such as it is.	Iru bi o ti jẹ.
I understand too.	Mo ti loye ju.
One cannot think of a woman.	Eniyan ko le ro pe o jẹ obinrin.
Nothing to be interested in here.	Ko si ohun ti o nifẹ si nibi.
I can't wait to see you again.	Emi ko le duro lati ri ọ lẹẹkansi.
Well worth it in my opinion.	Daradara tọ o ni ero mi.
You have lost my hand.	O ti padanu ọwọ mi.
Why should anyone remember this?	Kini idi ti ẹnikan gbọdọ ranti eyi?
It's easy to talk.	O rọrun lati ba sọrọ.
Everyone wants to change their circumstances.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ lati yi awọn ipo wọn pada.
I am not sure how this should work.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bi eyi ṣe yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
This is an amazing story.	Eyi jẹ itan iyalẹnu kan.
They are, but they are not legally required to be.	Wọn jẹ, ṣugbọn wọn ko nilo labẹ ofin lati jẹ.
Look! 	Wo!
Neither the home environment is sound.	Bẹni ayika ile jẹ ohun.
I do not remember that wedding, he said.	Emi ko ranti igbeyawo yẹn, o sọ.
Something is also simple and human '.	Nkankan tun rọrun ati eniyan'.
No one needed.	Ko si ọkan ti a nilo.
Will say.	Yoo sọ.
We are here to help you.	A wa nibi lati ran ọ lọwọ.
Look over there.	Wo lori nibẹ.
I can’t think of a reason why it might be.	Emi ko le ro ero kini idi rẹ le jẹ.
Good job.	Iṣẹ to dara.
However, let me ask you a question.	Sibẹsibẹ, jẹ ki n beere ibeere kan fun ọ.
Some of you believe he is too young.	Diẹ ninu awọn dajudaju gbagbọ pe o jẹ ọdọ ju.
He waited until everyone was gone.	O duro titi gbogbo eniyan fi lọ.
This year, he came back with a new one.	Ni ọdun yii, o pada pẹlu ọkan tuntun.
You may understand to marry your wife, right now.	O le loye lati fẹ iyawo rẹ, ni bayi.
Not there.	Ko si nibẹ.
I really like your advice.	Mo fẹran imọran rẹ dara julọ.
If you can help another, do as you can.	Ti o ba le ṣe iranlọwọ fun miiran, ṣe bi o ti le ṣe.
You can go to another company completely.	O le lọ si ile-iṣẹ miiran patapata.
Respect for the law.	Ọwọ fun ofin.
Our eyes meet.	Oju wa pade.
I understand, but no one can help.	Mo loye, ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o le ṣe iranlọwọ.
That's very good.	Iyẹn dara pupọ.
And you expected.	Ati awọn ti o ti ṣe yẹ.
So that kind of thinking goes.	Nitorina iru ero bẹẹ lọ.
It is done now.	O ti ṣe ni bayi.
I still remember a lot.	Mo tun ranti ọpọlọpọ.
They have to learn like that.	Wọn ni lati kọ ẹkọ bii.
She went to lunch.	O lọ si ounjẹ ọsan.
To where or when, we do not know.	Si ibi tabi nigba, a ko mọ.
Everywhere there is human strength.	Nibi gbogbo ni okun eniyan.
I do not want to go to your mother.	Emi ko fẹ lati lọ si iya rẹ.
They say you will eat anything.	Wọn sọ pe iwọ yoo jẹ ohunkohun.
He finished the book on time, he said.	O pari iwe naa ni akoko, o sọ.
But that is not for him at all.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe fun u rara.
I'll put it on myself.	Emi yoo fi si ara mi.
He hopes it is one of the last two.	O nireti pe o jẹ ọkan ninu awọn meji ti o kẹhin.
His hand came up, standing on both sides of my face.	Ọwọ rẹ wa soke, o duro ni ẹgbẹ mejeeji ti oju mi.
I can't take it off.	Nko le mu kuro.
He has the ability to use his amazing hand.	O ni agbara lati lo ọwọ rẹ ti o jẹ iyanu.
This program is ambitious but possible.	Eto yii jẹ ifẹ agbara ṣugbọn o ṣee ṣe.
We will receive a small gift or something.	A yoo gba ẹbun kekere tabi nkankan.
That should be sufficient.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o to.
He has to live his life for you.	O ni lati gbe igbesi aye rẹ fun ọ.
I hope you will come soon.	Mo nireti pe iwọ yoo wa laipẹ.
He lost my mouth.	O padanu ẹnu mi.
She decided to go to a restaurant.	O pinnu lati lọ si ounjẹ.
Not much, but a few.	Kii ṣe pupọ, ṣugbọn diẹ.
As an idea.	Bi ero.
Wait until this appears.	Duro titi eyi yoo fi han.
If so, love is first and foremost.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, ifẹ ni oju akọkọ.
But it is too late.	Sugbon o ti pẹ ju.
Sometimes you just can’t find the right words to say.	Nigba miiran o kan ko le rii awọn ọrọ ti o tọ lati sọ.
He tried to change it.	O gbiyanju lati yi i pada.
Everyone wants some money!	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ diẹ ninu owo!
I will do so.	Emi yoo ṣe bẹ.
It means a lot to hear you say that.	O tumọ si pupọ lati gbọ ti o sọ bẹ.
No, don't laugh.	Rara, ma rẹrin.
It was the first game of the company.	O jẹ ere akọkọ ti ile-iṣẹ naa.
But he could not accept this.	Sugbon ko le gba eleyi.
Very, very, very high.	Pupọ, pupọ, ga.
He has no mother or father.	Ko ni iya tabi baba.
For him, change, and make the cause cause !.	Fun u, yi pada, ki o ṣe awọn ibeere fa!.
You have had a hard life.	O ti ni igbesi aye lile.
But, say you want more.	Ṣugbọn, sọ pe o fẹ diẹ sii.
We do not.	A ko ṣe.
They do not know their man.	Wọn ko mọ ọkunrin wọn.
But there is more.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii wa.
Your picture is.	Aworan rẹ jẹ.
I can drink.	Mo le mu.
It will come back, probably, but these things take time.	Yoo pada wa, jasi, ṣugbọn nkan wọnyi gba akoko.
It is hard to take.	O ti wa ni gidigidi lati ya.
I have found the truth.	Mo ti ri otitọ.
It should not be.	O yẹ ko ni.
It's very simple, he thought.	O rọrun pupọ, o ro.
I do not know anything about myself.	Nko mo nkankan nipa ara mi.
It is possible that that could happen.	O ṣee ṣe pe iyẹn le ṣẹlẹ.
He has borrowed a lot of money from friends.	O ti ya ọpọlọpọ owo lati ọdọ awọn ọrẹ.
There is no sun.	Ko si oorun.
We’ve seen a lot of this talk lately.	A ti rii ọpọlọpọ ọrọ yii laipẹ.
We put the first thing first.	A fi akọkọ ohun akọkọ.
You will start there and walk down.	O yoo bẹrẹ nibẹ ki o si rin si isalẹ.
I started to hate it.	Mo ti bẹrẹ lati korira rẹ.
That said.	Ti o tun sọ.
That is his position.	Ipo re niyen.
It is on a table.	O wa lori tabili kan.
It can be a long day, he said.	O le jẹ ọjọ pipẹ, o sọ.
Another man.	Ọkunrin miiran.
After the meeting was over, he went to his cottage.	Lẹhin ti ipade ti pari, o lọ si ile kekere rẹ.
He read the books.	O ka awọn iwe naa.
He also loves it.	O tun fẹran rẹ.
There is no one like them.	Ko si ẹnikan ti wọn dabi.
You can not do something like this up.	O ko le ṣe nkan bi eyi soke.
I give up.	Mo gba fun.
Sorry to call you late.	Ma binu lati pe ki o pẹ.
Tell us a little about yourself.	Sọ fun wa diẹ nipa ara rẹ.
He decided.	O pinnu.
Maybe we should give them space.	Boya o yẹ ki a fun wọn ni aye.
Of course your home is yours.	Dajudaju ile rẹ jẹ tirẹ.
They make a lot of music.	Wọn ṣe orin pupọ.
That will take most people at least a week.	Iyẹn yoo gba ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni o kere ju ọsẹ kan.
I will be.	Emi yoo jẹ.
I should know that you can not go through it.	Mo yẹ ki o mọ pe o ko le lọ nipasẹ rẹ.
You can get to love it.	O le gba lati nifẹ rẹ.
You have to take it off your clothes.	O ni ki o yọ kuro ninu aṣọ rẹ.
You can make some big money.	O le ṣe diẹ ninu awọn nla owo.
It is all making sense.	O ti wa ni gbogbo ṣiṣe awọn ori.
Now it is only in hand.	Bayi o jẹ nikan ni ọwọ ọwọ.
Of course, they spent some time together at school.	Dajudaju, wọn ti lo akoko diẹ papọ ni ile-iwe.
The teachers gave it to them.	Awọn olukọ ni o fun wọn.
Try some of the songs below.	Gbiyanju diẹ ninu awọn orin ni isalẹ.
I walk on.	Mo rin lori.
He got up to leave.	O dide lati lọ kuro.
Words are good.	Awọn ọrọ dara.
You have to move in.	O ni lati gbe ni.
I am incredibly beautiful.	Mi jẹ ti iyalẹnu lẹwa.
Make sure to tell the truth about it.	Rii daju lati sọ otitọ nipa rẹ.
You need to return home.	O nilo lati pada si ile.
The brother has been there for you all his life.	Arakunrin naa ti wa nibẹ fun ọ ni gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ.
There is something they did not tell you.	Ohun kan wa ti wọn ko sọ fun ọ.
What time will we meet?	Akoko wo ni a yoo pade?
Way back when.	Ọna pada nigbati.
Or maybe one of your kids would have run.	Tabi boya ọkan ninu awọn ọmọ rẹ yoo ti sare.
I find it very important not to skip breakfast.	Mo rii pe o ṣe pataki ni pataki lati ma fo ounjẹ owurọ.
We make the bad guy good.	A jẹ ki eniyan buburu dara dara.
Newspapers say no.	Awọn iwe iroyin sọ rara.
I certainly do not need both.	Emi dajudaju ko nilo awọn mejeeji.
I want high.	Mo fẹ ga.
People with a better education usually get more.	Awọn eniyan ti o ni ẹkọ ti o dara julọ maa n gba diẹ sii.
You can put your family through that.	O le fi ebi re nipasẹ ti.
It works well.	O n ṣiṣẹ daradara.
It has no tone.	Ko ni ohun orin.
Are you looking for something else?	Ṣe o n wa nkan miiran?
We return to this point below.	A pada si aaye yii ni isalẹ.
His position is that knowledge must be tested.	Ipo rẹ ni pe imọran gbọdọ jẹ idanwo.
Everything you want.	Gbogbo ohun ti o fẹ.
In fact, a long time.	Ni otitọ, igba pipẹ.
This type of music is usually played at noon.	Iru orin yii maa n dun ni ọsan.
We will not starve.	Ebi ko ni pa wa.
But that is not what you want.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti o fẹ.
We talk every day.	A sọrọ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Of course he is not one of us.	Dajudaju kii ṣe ọkan ninu wa.
Not enough.	Ko to.
Both love it here.	Awọn mejeeji fẹran rẹ nibi.
Because this is something that does not get into the books.	Nitori eyi ni nkan ti ko gba sinu awọn iwe.
They were killed.	A pa wọn.
You only go to the doctors.	O lọ si awọn dokita nikan.
Everyone in the class changed and looked at me.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o wa ni kilasi yipada o wo mi.
Looking at this in this way, the mistakes are understandable.	Ti wo eyi ni ọna yii, awọn aṣiṣe jẹ oye.
You have done a good job.	O ti ṣe kan ti o dara ise.
I'm happy.	Inu mi dun.
In the first text of this book we did not use a picture.	Ninu ọrọ akọkọ ti iwe yii a ko lo aworan kan.
If it happens, it happens.	Ti o ba ṣẹlẹ, ṣẹlẹ.
I do not know what to expect.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o reti.
He quickly learned how much it was.	O yara kọ iye ti o jẹ.
He had no intention of going inside.	O ko ni ipinnu lati wọ inu.
Or maybe the song, when it turns out, is enough.	Tabi boya orin naa, nigbati o ba yipada, ti to.
It should not take too long.	Ko yẹ ki o gba akoko pupọ.
I do not know what the problem is.	Emi ko mọ kini iṣoro naa.
Something is going on here.	Nkankan n lọ nibi.
I took them out and gave him one.	Mo gba wọn jade mo si fun u ni ọkan.
I hope you will call me.	Mo nireti pe iwọ yoo pe mi.
We have exhausted these people.	A ti rẹ awọn eniyan wọnyi.
Just look at what happened today.	Kan wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ loni.
I do not know when that time will come.	Nko mo igba ti akoko naa yoo de.
It seemed impossible.	O dabi enipe ko ṣee ṣe.
I mean, something happened to me.	Mo tumọ si, nkan kan ṣẹlẹ si mi.
He thought he was alone.	O ro pe o wa nikan.
Is it the same to you?	Ṣe o jẹ kanna si ọ?
We are able to do a lot.	A ni anfani lati ṣe pupọ.
Boy, it's too late.	Ọmọkunrin, o ti pẹ.
That will not work.	Iyẹn kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
I could hear people coming to their feet.	Mo le gbọ awọn eniyan ti n de ẹsẹ wọn.
I believe he will love this work.	Mo gbagbọ pe yoo nifẹ iṣẹ yii.
Where did your people come from?	Nibo ni awọn eniyan rẹ ti wa?
He wonders how much time was lost.	O ṣe iyalẹnu iye akoko ti o padanu.
I hope you enjoy them as much as my children do.	Mo nireti pe o gbadun wọn bi awọn ọmọ mi ti ṣe.
His great time and no one wrote a word about him.	Akoko nla rẹ ko si si ẹnikan ti o kọ ọrọ kan nipa rẹ.
So, where did all this trouble come from?	Nitorina, nibo ni gbogbo wahala yii ti wa?
I didn’t hear it coming, but it was there.	Emi ko gbọ pe o nbọ, ṣugbọn o wa nibẹ.
He will not let you go.	Ko ni jẹ ki o lọ.
You want to go out and do things.	O fẹ lati jade lọ ṣe awọn nkan.
No brothers.	Ko si awọn arakunrin.
If anyone heard anything it would have done.	Ti ẹnikẹni ba gbọ ohunkohun yoo ti ṣe.
He opened the doors early.	O ṣi awọn ilẹkun ni kutukutu.
And a lot of men like it that way.	Ati ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkunrin fẹran rẹ ni ọna yẹn.
It does not look like it.	Ko dabi rẹ.
It can be even better.	O le paapaa dara.
I am reading this book.	Mo n ka iwe yii.
Do not write anything.	Maṣe kọ ohunkohun.
What will he look like? 	Kini yoo wo?
We will contact.	A yoo kan si.
I touched one.	Mo fi ọwọ kan ọkan.
You just want to enjoy today.	O kan fẹ lati gbadun loni.
We just want to go out fast.	A kan fẹ lati jade lọ si sare.
We are always looking to improve.	A n wa nigbagbogbo lati mu dara sii.
I’m, not surprisingly, down.	Mo wa, kii ṣe iyalẹnu, ni isalẹ.
There is no other idea just that.	Ko si ero miiran ti o kan.
This rule is not enough.	Ofin yii ko to.
The police would not want that.	Ọlọpa ko ni fẹ iyẹn.
He turned to run.	O yipada lati sare.
To inform us.	Lati fun wa ni iroyin.
They will not come to the party!	Wọn kii yoo wa si ayẹyẹ naa!
One word, in fact.	Gbogbo ọrọ kan, ni otitọ.
Bad in that good way.	Buburu ni ọna ti o dara iyẹn.
This can take many years to complete.	Eyi le gba ọpọlọpọ ọdun lati pari.
Your questions drive time.	Awọn ibeere rẹ wakọ akoko.
He says here that he is on vacation.	O sọ nibi pe o wa ni isinmi.
What a difficult question.	Kini ibeere ti o nira.
Why didn't they try to change it?	Kilode ti wọn ko gbiyanju lati yi i pada?
It all takes time.	Gbogbo rẹ gba akoko.
Or we don’t want it to be.	Tabi a ko fẹ ki o jẹ.
You always get your lives when you cross this river.	O nigbagbogbo gba awọn aye rẹ nigbati o ba n kọja odo yii.
Lots of people there for me.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan wa nibẹ fun mi.
That sounds like a bad question.	Iyẹn dabi ibeere ti ko dara.
You must do this.	O gbọdọ ṣe eyi.
Keep looking at it if you don’t believe me.	Tẹsiwaju wo rẹ ti o ko ba gbagbọ mi.
You also need a house.	O tun nilo ile kan.
We had a great time.	A ni akoko ti o dara julọ.
There is no place for a group to do itself.	Ko si ibi ti ẹgbẹ kan yoo ṣe funrararẹ.
Like some of them.	Bi diẹ ninu wọn.
Some are required when others are used.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti a beere nigbati awọn miiran ba lo.
Want to know if the friend will leave your home.	Fẹ lati mọ boya ọrẹ naa yoo yọ kuro ni ile rẹ.
Which, in a way, you have.	Eyi ti, ni ọna kan, o ni.
It should make it easier for you to stand.	O yẹ ki o jẹ ki o rọrun fun ọ lati duro.
What an old place it would be without the old class.	Kini ibi atijọ yoo jẹ laisi kilasi atijọ.
I mean he didn't drink.	Mo tumọ si pe ko mu.
You are gone this morning.	O ti lọ lati owurọ yi.
I love her.	Mo ni ife si.
I am convinced of that.	Emi ni idaniloju iyẹn.
I have a cold.	Otutu nla ni mi.
I do not do anything like this.	Emi ko ṣe ohunkohun bi eleyi.
But it has to be a lot.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati jẹ pupọ.
Now you can only go to him in your thoughts.	Bayi o le nikan lọ si rẹ ninu rẹ ero.
He has been with me for a long time.	O ti wa pẹlu mi pẹ pupọ.
He kept his mouth shut.	O pa ẹnu rẹ mọ.
I returned to the car.	Mo pada si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
These shoes are too small for your feet.	Awọn bata wọnyi kere ju fun ẹsẹ rẹ.
He said he could not believe it.	O sọ pe oun ko le gbagbọ.
You will have to wait.	Iwọ yoo ni lati nireti.
I have been so completely.	Mo ti jẹ bẹ patapata.
I hope for you.	Mo lero fun ọ.
They put more work than anything else.	Wọn fi iṣẹ ju gbogbo nkan miiran lọ.
How can life go this way!	Bawo ni igbesi aye ṣe le lọ ni ọna yii!
In a year or two, we will be fine.	Ni ọdun kan tabi meji, a yoo dara.
Write another new word.	Kọ ọrọ tuntun miiran.
Hence the fire.	Nibi ti ina.
He said no, but he did.	O sọ pe ko ṣe, ṣugbọn o ṣe.
Top family names given to their cities.	Awọn orukọ idile oke ti a fi fun awọn ilu wọn.
So on top of that.	Nitorina lori oke ti ohun.
I see it.	Mo wo o.
If so, the ball will not get down.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, bọọlu ko ni gba si isalẹ.
I let him live with me for a while.	Mo jẹ ki o gbe pẹlu mi fun igba diẹ.
He walked away.	O rin kuro.
They continue to run without a break.	Wọn tẹsiwaju lati ṣiṣe laisi isinmi.
She decided to live her own life.	O pinnu lati gbe igbesi aye ara rẹ.
He knew he was.	O mọ pe oun ni.
And that is where we went wrong.	Ati pe iyẹn ni ibi ti a ti ṣe aṣiṣe.
He closed his eyes and got up.	Oju re pa o si dide.
History has seen many such cases.	Itan ti rii ọpọlọpọ iru awọn ipo bẹẹ.
The brother came up.	Arakunrin naa wa soke.
This man is the man of his word.	Ọkunrin yii jẹ eniyan ti ọrọ rẹ.
It always explains how other people feel.	O nigbagbogbo ṣe alaye bi awọn eniyan miiran ṣe lero.
I have many other obligations as a mother.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ awọn adehun miiran bi iya.
Both have written books.	Awọn mejeeji ti kọ awọn iwe.
We can not know why.	A ko le mọ idi ti.
We think we may not be home when we return.	A ro pe a le ma ni ile nigbati a ba pada.
Puppies can not bathe.	Awọn ọmọ aja ko le wẹ.
I just want to feel.	Mo kan fẹ lati lero.
He is saying something.	O n sọ nkankan.
That, of course, did not happen.	Iyẹn, dajudaju, ko ṣẹlẹ.
This group should of course be able to do that.	Ẹgbẹ yii yẹ ki o dajudaju ni anfani lati ṣe iyẹn.
Their time will be another day, more to the future.	Akoko wọn yoo jẹ ọjọ miiran, diẹ si ọjọ iwaju.
He hopes to return to his workplace soon.	O nireti lati pada si ibi iṣẹ rẹ laipẹ.
Maybe you will enjoy it.	Boya o yoo gbadun rẹ.
I wonder where it went.	Mo Iyanu ibi ti o ti lọ.
We are important here.	A ṣe pataki nibi.
Take life.	Gba aye.
No, you can only be a girl.	Rara, o le jẹ ọmọbirin nikan.
And players don’t usually.	Ati awọn ẹrọ orin ko maa n ṣe.
We live in an uncertain world.	A n gbe ni aye ti ko ni idaniloju.
That is what they are telling us.	Ohun ti wọn n sọ fun wa niyẹn.
All you have to do is stay.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ni lati ṣe ni duro jẹ.
This song is really special.	Orin yi jẹ pataki gaan.
You may need a little more.	O le nilo diẹ diẹ sii.
When you do, give him a reward.	Nigbati o ba ṣe, fun u ni ere kan.
He doesn't like this at all.	Ko fẹran eyi diẹ rara.
Something more like.	Nkankan diẹ sii bi.
He stood his ground.	O duro ni ibiti o wa.
Maybe who he is.	Boya ẹniti o jẹ.
It's coming.	O n bọ.
Some prefer to spend the day alone.	Diẹ ninu awọn fẹ lati lo ọjọ nikan.
They are taking dogs for a walk.	Wọn n mu awọn aja fun rin.
He did not get up.	Ko dide.
You know they exist.	O mọ wọn wà.
We are almost made history.	A ti fẹrẹ ṣe itan.
And that can't happen.	Ati pe ko le ṣẹlẹ.
I’m pretty sure.	Mo ni idaniloju ni otitọ.
Is there.	O wa nibẹ.
I have most of those books, give a few.	Mo ni julọ ti awon iwe, fi fun kan diẹ.
He could not say whether they were inside or outside.	Ko le sọ boya wọn wa ninu tabi ita.
Expect to be warm and rainy this summer.	Reti lati gbona ati ojo ni igba ooru yii.
They will stand, however, the bad ones.	Wọn yoo duro, sibẹsibẹ, awọn buburu.
Remember, space is in your imagination.	Ranti, aaye wa ni oju inu rẹ.
There is no better time to be alive.	Ko si akoko ti o dara julọ lati wa laaye.
Or any of the other.	Tabi eyikeyi ninu awọn miiran.
A couple of months have passed.	Oṣu meji kan ti kọja.
So take your time.	Nitorina gba akoko rẹ.
My time away was well worth it.	Mi akoko kuro je daradara tọ o.
We also hope.	A tun nireti.
He would have married this baby.	Oun yoo ti fẹ ọmọ yii.
We played together.	A dun papọ.

See if you can let it pass the lights.	Wo boya o le jẹ ki o kọja awọn ina.
I am walking to school.	Mo n rin si ile-iwe.
It went bad.	O lọ ko dara.
The key is gone.	Bọtini naa ti lọ.
If not, you will have only one.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, iwọ yoo ni ọkan nikan.
I spent many hours outside with them.	Mo lo ọpọlọpọ awọn wakati ni ita pẹlu wọn.
Someone hurt him, in purpose.	Ẹnikan ṣe ipalara fun u, ni idi.
We make sure that.	A rii daju pe.
It is also new.	O tun jẹ tuntun.
You should be in school.	O yẹ ki o wa ni ile-iwe.
His house is on a hill.	Ile re wa lori oke kan.
Got to see it.	Ni lati ri i.
People feel only in a big city.	Awọn eniyan lero nikan ni ilu nla kan.
But we ate late, we only ate lunch now.	Ṣugbọn a jẹun pẹ, a jẹ ounjẹ ọsan nikan ni bayi.
He forced his hand.	O fi agbara mu ọwọ rẹ.
Take breaks from time to time.	Ya isinmi lati igba de igba.
You will be amazed at how well it works !.	Iwọ yoo jẹ ohun iyanu nipa bi o ṣe le ṣiṣẹ daradara!.
But the one.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọkan.
You will have a bad time.	Iwọ yoo ni akoko buburu.
It made us laugh a lot.	O mu wa rẹrin pupọ.
I do not see why.	Emi ko ri idi.
He hopes	O nireti
I have had a long time.	Mo ti ni igba pipẹ.
Do not go through the city.	Maṣe lọ nipasẹ ilu.
Tom has been out of work for months.	Tom ti jade ni iṣẹ fun awọn oṣu.
Something happened.	Nkankan ti ṣẹlẹ.
I have to admit this is a very difficult question.	Mo ni lati gba eyi jẹ ibeere ti o nira pupọ.
But not just a tree.	Sugbon ko o kan a igi.
Your thoughts determine how you feel.	Awọn ero rẹ pinnu bi o ṣe lero.
I'm sure we don't.	Mo da o loju pe a ko.
It's fast.	O yara.
Of course there won’t be any concerts either.	Dajudaju kii yoo si awọn ere orin paapaa.
Or at least try to.	Tabi o kere gbiyanju lati.
But he will have to tell you about that.	Ṣugbọn o yoo ni lati sọ fun ọ nipa iyẹn.
I thought of him.	Mo ro fun u.
We want to give birth to another.	A fe lati bi miiran.
You can't stop.	O ko le da duro.
He had been dead for two days.	O ti ku fun ọjọ meji.
I think he was more afraid to come.	Mo ro pe o bẹru diẹ sii lati wa.
He has a great tone, man.	O ni ohun orin ti o dara julọ, ọkunrin.
This is your home.	Eyi ni ile rẹ.
He told me before.	O sọ fun mi tẹlẹ.
He is not dead '.	Ko ti ku'.
But, perhaps, not for you.	Ṣugbọn, boya, kii ṣe fun ọ.
Good job on that !.	Iṣẹ to dara lori eyi!.
You’ve moved more than that.	O ti gbe diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
There is a police car on the driveway.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ọlọpa kan wa lori wakọ naa.
If you do not like it, you can pass it on.	Ti o ko ba fẹran rẹ, o le kọja lọ.
Our testing program is very demanding.	Eto idanwo wa jẹ ibeere pupọ.
They need it here.	Wọn nilo rẹ nibi.
I can always sleep in the end.	Mo le sun nigbagbogbo ni ipari.
The whole store was given away.	A fun kuro gbogbo itaja.
Okay, no you shouldn't.	O dara, rara o ko yẹ.
A face that is too long.	Oju kan ti o ti gun ju.
Our young friend will always be outside.	Ọrẹ ọdọ wa yoo wa ni ita nigbagbogbo.
The world is a few light days from here.	Aye wa ni awọn ọjọ ina diẹ lati ibi.
No rain was found in this area.	A ko ri ojo ni agbegbe yii.
You must please do more for us regularly.	O gbọdọ jọwọ ṣe diẹ sii nigbagbogbo fun wa.
You have missed this or you have missed that.	O ti padanu eyi tabi o ti padanu iyẹn.
Everyone will be back.	Gbogbo eniyan yoo pada sẹhin.
Here is an idea.	Eyi ni imọran kan.
It is more that your time has come.	O jẹ diẹ sii pe akoko rẹ ti de.
I will publish more.	Emi yoo jade diẹ sii.
All in all, it comes in handy.	Ni gbogbo rẹ, o wa ni ọwọ.
It should not be outside.	O ko yẹ ki o wa ni ita.
It's my game.	O ni ere mi.
Start now.	Bẹrẹ ni bayi.
Just more than such people.	O kan ju awọn eniyan bẹẹ lọ.
Eggs are best in the summer.	Igba ni o dara julọ ninu ooru.
It is home and always will be.	O jẹ ile ati nigbagbogbo yoo jẹ.
It's beautiful and.	O lẹwa ati.
I told myself it wasn’t a personal thing.	Mo sọ fun ara mi pe kii ṣe nkan ti ara ẹni.
Or possibly not at all.	Tabi o ṣeeṣe rara.
I doubt, if they have any desire, that it will work.	Mo ṣiyemeji, ti wọn ba ni ifẹ eyikeyi, pe yoo ṣiṣẹ.
They have walked for what seemed like forever.	Wọn ti rin fun ohun ti o dabi enipe lailai.
That house has not been built for many years.	Ile yẹn ko tii ṣe fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
At first, that was impossible.	Ni akọkọ, iyẹn ko ṣee ṣe.
We get to borrow a little money.	A gba lati ya a diẹ owo.
No one likes to think about it.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o nifẹ lati ronu nipa rẹ.
I walked out of several rooms.	Mo rin jade ninu awọn yara pupọ.
For information, see text.	Fun alaye, wo ọrọ.
But we will not consider this.	Sugbon a yoo ko ro yi.
There is no way here.	Ko si ọna ti o wa nibi.
It starts to wear.	O bẹrẹ lati wọ.
But he didn’t want to talk about it that day.	Ṣugbọn ko fẹ lati sọrọ nipa rẹ ni ọjọ yẹn.
It didn't sound good last night, you know.	Ko dun ni alẹ ana, o mọ.
It is what you want to do.	O jẹ ohun ti o fẹ ṣe.
Something went wrong with the fire.	Nkankan ti ko tọ pẹlu ina le ṣii.
Either way, good to see you again.	Ọna boya, o dara lati ri ọ lẹẹkansi.
So we are still together.	Nitorina a tun wa papọ.
Her eyes were on the doors.	Oju rẹ wà lori awọn ilẹkun.
Is that all?	Se gbogbo e ni?
Her face changed significantly.	Oju rẹ yipada pataki.
He is not a friend.	Ko jẹ ọrẹ.
A book full of stories for children.	Iwe kan ti o kun fun awọn itan fun awọn ọmọde.
I believe that is the final test.	Mo gbagbọ pe iyẹn ni idanwo ikẹhin.
She is happy for the observation.	Inu rẹ dun fun akiyesi naa.
For someone like you, it is not easy to have friends.	Fun ẹnikan bii rẹ, ko rọrun lati ni awọn ọrẹ.
He did not want any.	Ko fẹ eyikeyi.
This will not be a game.	Eyi kii yoo jẹ ere.
He drove his team that way.	O wakọ ẹgbẹ rẹ si ọna yẹn.
Which you forgot.	Eyi ti o gbagbe.
Can't do it tonight.	Ko le ṣe ni alẹ oni.
He was not so sure.	O si je ko bẹ daju.

It felt good, really.	O ro dara, ni otitọ.

So now it seems that everyone is everywhere.	Nitorina bayi o dabi pe gbogbo eniyan nibi gbogbo.
Do you cut your own hair?	Ṣe o ge irun ti ara rẹ?
Your job is to make my men fit to work.	Iṣẹ rẹ ni lati jẹ ki awọn ọkunrin mi yẹ lati ṣiṣẹ.
Words will not be allowed.	Awọn ọrọ kii yoo gba laaye.
But know this.	Ṣugbọn mọ eyi.
But that is not what happened.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Great thing happened.	Nla nla ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It has been a pleasure to know you so well.	O ti dun pupọ lati mọ ọ daradara.
I mean, it probably doesn’t need to happen.	Mo tumọ si, o ṣee ṣe ko nilo lati ṣẹlẹ.
I didn’t know he would ask you for that.	Emi ko mọ pe yoo beere lọwọ rẹ fun iyẹn.
The girls came back.	Awọn ọmọbirin tun pada.
You must not make mistakes.	O ko gbọdọ ṣe awọn aṣiṣe.

It will make everything a lot easier.	Yoo jẹ ki ohun gbogbo rọrun pupọ.
I had an amazing time with him.	Mo ni akoko iyanu pẹlu rẹ.
They decided it was best to go to the police.	Wọn pinnu pe o dara julọ lati lọ si ọdọ ọlọpa.
Just continue on your way.	O kan tẹsiwaju ni ọna rẹ.
Your house, which has everything in it, caught fire.	Ile rẹ, ti o ni ohun gbogbo ti o ni ninu, mu ina.
The lower world is there.	Aye isalẹ wa nibẹ.
I can’t wait to hear how it goes.	Emi ko le duro lati gbọ bi o ti lọ.
Only me and my family.	Emi ati idile mi nikan ni.
Bring a man back to here.	Mu ọkunrin kan pada si ibi.
Give it a try !.	Fun o kan gbiyanju!.
They will not get more information from you.	Wọn kii yoo gba alaye diẹ sii lati ọdọ rẹ.
We are all.	Gbogbo wa.
They changed and changed.	Wọn yipada o si yipada.
We want to give you information to make that decision.	A fẹ lati fun ọ ni alaye lati ṣe ipinnu yẹn.
Go where you want to go.	Lọ si ibi ti o fẹ lati lọ.
She’s a woman, again.	O jẹ obinrin, lẹẹkansi.

Or try to.	Tabi gbiyanju lati.
The situation is excellent.	Ipo naa dara julọ.
Impossible to read.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati ka.
You can, you know.	O le, o mọ.
But that means well, that you do not have to.	Ṣugbọn eyi tumọ si daradara, pe o ko ni lati.
You know, you just lost yourself in it.	O mọ, o kan padanu ara rẹ ninu rẹ.
No work, no food.	Ko si iṣẹ, ko si ounjẹ.
That’s what everyone is talking about.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo eniyan n sọrọ nipa.
He looked inside.	O wo inu.
Let's sit down and talk for a few minutes.	Jẹ ki a joko ki a sọrọ fun iṣẹju diẹ.
You have learned to play the game.	O ti kọ ẹkọ lati ṣe ere naa.
But it is very good.	Ṣugbọn o dara pupọ.
Before we were born anything we knew.	Ṣaaju ki a to bi ohunkohun ti a mọ.
And in this way it is.	Ati ni ọna yii o jẹ.
So it will be very important there.	Nitorina o yoo jẹ pataki pupọ nibẹ.
I am not a child at all.	Emi ko jẹ ọmọde rara.
Come here.	Wa nibi.
Let's pass.	Jẹ ki a kọja.
The father let the children wait.	Baba jẹ ki awọn ọmọ duro pẹ.
It should not have done so, either.	O yẹ ko ti ṣe bẹ, boya.
You’re starting to feel some just standing there.	O n bẹrẹ lati ni rilara diẹ ninu o kan duro nibẹ.
I wonder how they did that.	Mo ṣe iyalẹnu bawo ni wọn ṣe ṣe iyẹn.
The room will not work with more than one person in it.	Yara naa kii yoo ṣiṣẹ pẹlu eniyan diẹ sii ju ọkan lọ ninu rẹ.
Now for the future.	Bayi fun ojo iwaju.
She was scared, and with purpose.	O bẹru, ati pẹlu idi.
It has allowed the child to become stronger.	O ti gba ọmọ laaye lati ni okun sii.
It’s like everyone else.	O dabi gbogbo eniyan miiran.
Repeat errors and other problems.	Tun awọn aṣiṣe ati awọn iṣoro miiran.
If money is anything.	Ti owo je ohunkohun.
He works from morning till night.	O n ṣiṣẹ lọwọ lati owurọ si alẹ.
Some people get away from it.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan gba kuro lati o.
The woman had some time left for him.	Obinrin naa ni akoko diẹ ti o ku fun u.
Everyone is still at home.	Gbogbo eniyan tun wa ni ile.
The questions seemed simple enough.	Awọn ibeere dabi enipe o rọrun to.
You want to be in the game, you want to be serious.	O fẹ lati wa ninu ere, o fẹ lati ṣe pataki.
Like my father.	Bi baba mi.
Please if you can help me with this.	Jọwọ ti o ba le ran mi lọwọ pẹlu eyi.
This is however just my opinion.	Eleyi jẹ sibẹsibẹ o kan mi ero.
Everything must stop.	Ohun gbogbo gbọdọ da.
People inside will feel something, know nothing.	Awọn eniyan inu yoo lero nkankan, ko mọ nkankan.
That was a lot of money.	Ti o je kan pupo ti owo.
Everyone raised their hands.	Gbogbo eniyan gbe ọwọ wọn soke.
It's time for bed.	O to akoko fun ibusun.
And yet they do not think it is an issue.	Ati sibẹsibẹ wọn ko ro pe o jẹ ọrọ kan.
This place has started to smell bad.	Ibi yii ti bẹrẹ lati gbọ oorun buburu.
Do not tell the police.	Maṣe sọ fun ọlọpa.
It works.	O si ṣe.
The place is on a hill.	Ibi naa wa lori oke kan.
About both things.	Nipa awọn nkan mejeeji.
There is no time to lose.	Ko si akoko lati padanu.
We can handle that because it will come back.	A le mu iyẹn nitori pe yoo pada sẹhin.
But of course, a lot more to it.	Ṣugbọn dajudaju, ọpọlọpọ diẹ sii si o.
Or it could be.	Tabi o le jẹ.
You do not want that.	O ko fẹ iyẹn.
Your bed is made.	A ṣe ibusun rẹ.
A man walks towards the car.	Ọkunrin kan rin si ọna ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
Required.	Ti beere fun.
I have to leave it tomorrow.	Mo ni lati fi i silẹ ni ọla.
Easy to read for him.	Rọrun lati ka fun u.
It became my last few words.	O di awọn ọrọ diẹ ti o kẹhin mi duro.
It just isn't true.	O kan kii ṣe otitọ.
It worries me.	O ni aniyan fun mi.
But there are also big mistake rules.	Ṣugbọn awọn ofin aṣiṣe nla tun wa.
But do not expect too much.	Ṣugbọn maṣe nireti pupọ.
Spend time with yourself.	Lo akoko pẹlu ara rẹ.
The girl got into the car.	Ọmọbirin naa wọ inu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
I don’t think they can do it themselves.	Emi ko ro pe wọn le ṣe funrararẹ.
I deserve it.	Mo yẹ.
I'm glad to be in it.	Inu mi dun lati wa ninu rẹ.
No drop out.	Ko si silẹ jade.
You already know it.	O ti mọ ọ.
For this reason, he has refused to leave.	Fun idi eyi, o ti kọ lati lọ kuro.
Repeat on the top edge as shown.	Tun lori eti oke bi a ṣe han.
A family tree?	Igi idile kan?
Now you can do whatever you want.	Bayi o le ṣe ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
You can enjoy this book.	O le gbadun iwe yii.
But as it stands, this is not true.	Ṣugbọn bi o ti duro, eyi kii ṣe otitọ.
He turned his head, not looking at me.	O yi ori pada, ko wo mi.
I have never heard of you doing such a thing before.	Emi ko gbọ ti o ṣe iru ohun kan tẹlẹ.
One father was wrong.	Baba kan ni aṣiṣe.
Are you sure we are allowed to do this?	Ṣe o da ọ loju pe a gba wa laaye lati ṣe eyi?
I do not need anything.	Nko nilo nkankan.
You have received everything.	O ti gba ohun gbogbo.
I thought we could live with that.	Mo ti ro pe a le gbe pẹlu eyi.
I can't call the project a good place.	Emi ko le pe iṣẹ naa ni aaye to dara.
Some do not know what to do.	Diẹ ninu awọn ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
I want to drive my car.	Mo fẹ lati wakọ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi.
You and your team should find them alone.	Iwọ ati ẹgbẹ rẹ yẹ ki o wa wọn nikan.
This is needed for testing.	A nilo eyi fun idanwo.
Close your eyes and notice the sun around you.	Pa oju rẹ ki o ṣe akiyesi awọn oorun ti o wa ni ayika rẹ.
I received a letter a few days ago.	Mo gba lẹta kan ni awọn ọjọ diẹ sẹhin.
I'll get to you.	Emi yoo de inu rẹ.
He died this year.	Odun yi ni o ku.
I love my room.	Mo nifẹ yara mi.
Spend some time with them and ask them about their lives.	Lo akoko diẹ pẹlu wọn ki o beere lọwọ wọn nipa igbesi aye wọn.
You think as it should be, married or not.	O ro pe bi o ṣe yẹ lati jẹ, ni iyawo tabi rara.
He wanted nothing to do with it.	Ko fe nkankan lati se pẹlu rẹ.
Sleep through your room if you can.	Sun nipasẹ yara rẹ ti o ba le.
It will take years and years.	Yoo gba ọdun ati ọdun.
Okay, this is your life to get even.	O dara, eyi ni aye rẹ lati gba paapaa.
At one point, it was no longer possible.	Ni aaye kan, ko ṣee ṣe mọ.
I do not know much about any of them.	Emi ko mọ pupọ nipa eyikeyi ninu wọn.
He is coming back.	O n pada wa.
I know you hate me now.	Mo mọ pe o korira mi ni bayi.
Now, let us consider this for a moment.	Bayi, jẹ ki a ro eyi fun iṣẹju kan.
This is an important and true point.	Eyi jẹ aaye pataki ati otitọ.
See if you can translate them.	Wo boya o le tumọ wọn.
But this was on top.	Sugbon yi je lori oke.
Just leave school.	O kan kuro ni ile-iwe.
Sometimes some groups may seem way out.	Nigba miiran awọn ẹgbẹ kan le dabi ọna kuro.
Believe something, and find it everywhere.	Gba ohun kan gbọ, ki o si rii nibi gbogbo.
You can tell by your voice that this is important to him.	O le sọ nipasẹ ohun rẹ pe eyi ṣe pataki fun u.
Not long enough.	Ko pẹ to.
Two of the most efficient.	Meji ninu awọn julọ daradara.
Do not do that at all.	Maṣe ṣe iyẹn rara.
That is not what.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti.
Well, it's a lot.	Daradara, o jẹ pupọ.
There was little to hate about the cities.	Nibẹ wà diẹ lati korira nipa awọn ilu.
I remember well now.	Mo ranti daradara ni bayi.
He never left my side.	Ko kuro ni ẹgbẹ mi rara.
People should work together to change the law.	Awọn eniyan yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ papọ lati yi ofin pada.
Wrong time.	Akoko ti ko tọ.
You can go to the police.	O le lọ si ọlọpa.
And nothing even grows on its own.	Ati pe ko si nkankan paapaa ti o dagba funrararẹ.
We must think in more detail why this is.	A gbọdọ ronu ni awọn alaye diẹ sii idi ti eyi jẹ.
But I can say this.	Sugbon mo le sọ eyi.
Well, they are not.	O dara, wọn kii ṣe.
This time he is back.	Ni akoko yii o pada sẹhin.
And you will keep your mouth shut.	Ati pe iwọ yoo pa ẹnu rẹ mọ.
He can't really say it, he doesn't know.	Ko le sọ gaan rara, kii ṣe mọ.
You should have talked to him.	O yẹ ki o ti ba a sọrọ.
I have to leave early today.	Mo ni lati lọ kuro ni kutukutu loni.
It did the best thing for me.	O ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ fun mi.
But it came to me in uniform.	Ṣugbọn o wa si mi ni aṣọ.
My diet is not very good most of the time.	Ounjẹ mi ko dara pupọ julọ igba.
We think they died at sea.	A ro pe wọn ku ni okun.
This is a small problem.	Eyi jẹ iṣoro kekere.
We get a lot of that.	A gba pupọ ti iyẹn.
Okay, it won't.	O dara, ko ni ṣe.
Please do more.	Jọwọ ṣe diẹ sii.
Take my word for it, it will not be a problem.	Gba ọrọ mi fun, ko ni jẹ wahala.
Something has come up at work.	Nkankan ti wa soke ni iṣẹ.
If you do not want to help your parents, just say so.	Ti o ko ba fẹ lati ran awọn obi rẹ lọwọ, sọ bẹ nikan.
Life is what you do.	Igbesi aye jẹ ohun ti o ṣe.
You can continue, but do not forget that at least.	O le tẹsiwaju, ṣugbọn maṣe gbagbe pe o kere.
When was this castle built?	Nigbawo ni a kọ ile nla yii?
And no one asked.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti o beere.
He’s trying to get me back.	O n gbiyanju lati gba mi pada.
We know it won’t be.	A mọ pe kii yoo jẹ.
That is not possible.	Iyẹn ko ṣee ṣe.
Some books are old, some are very new.	Diẹ ninu awọn iwe ti atijọ, diẹ ninu awọn jẹ tuntun pupọ.
The sister was convinced too.	Arabinrin naa da a loju ju.
Feeling this song.	Rilara orin yii.
We will never feel one with our tail anymore.	A ko ni rilara ọkan pẹlu iru wa mọ.
Now it’s all understandable.	Bayi gbogbo rẹ jẹ oye.
But this one might work, too.	Ṣugbọn eyi kan le ṣiṣẹ, paapaa.
The brother needed a hand.	Arakunrin naa nilo ọwọ kan.
I know how to feel.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe gbọdọ ni rilara.
Now comes the time.	Bayi ni akoko ba wa.
That baby is always under the feet.	Ọmọ yẹn nigbagbogbo wa labẹ ẹsẹ.
He does not want to believe.	Ko fẹ gbagbọ.
But we have to see them soon.	Ṣugbọn a ni lati rii wọn laipẹ.
At least, around a lot of people.	O kere ju, ni ayika ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
Everyone high and low admitted.	Gbogbo eniyan ga ati kekere gba eleyi.
Who knows where.	Tani o mọ ibi.
He wanted to go out to dinner and let us stay.	O fẹ jade lọ si ounjẹ alẹ ki o fi wa duro.
This picture is incorrect.	Aworan yi ko tọ.
He began to get up.	O bẹrẹ si dide.
This thing really works.	Nkan yi ṣiṣẹ gaan.
He watched his work for a minute.	O wo iṣẹ rẹ fun iṣẹju kan.
One minute, please.	Jọwọ, iṣẹju kan.
Do this for a week.	Ṣe eyi fun ọsẹ kan.
The driver has not been hit as hard.	Awakọ naa ko ti lu bi lile.
I am very young.	Mo jẹ ọmọde pupọ.
When it rains, he thinks.	Nigbati ojo ba ro, o ro.
It was the first time it came out on its own.	O jẹ akoko akọkọ ti o jade funrararẹ.
You need to stop.	O nilo lati da.
I am happy about that.	Inu mi dun nipa iyẹn.
It doesn't seem to have come.	O ko dabi pe o ti wa.
Get a book after working in the garden.	Gba iwe lẹhin ti o ṣiṣẹ ninu ọgba.
The sister loves it, you know that.	Arabinrin naa fẹran rẹ, o mọ iyẹn.
I have seen them do.	Mo ti rii wọn ṣe.
But this comes with its own problems.	Ṣugbọn eyi wa pẹlu awọn iṣoro tirẹ.
She was afraid of that dog.	O bẹru aja yẹn.
He learned his first job.	O kọ iṣẹ akọkọ rẹ.
In your work.	Ni iṣẹ rẹ.
They hope to run across it again.	Wọn nireti lati sare kọja rẹ lẹẹkansi.
You think that makes sense.	O ro pe iyẹn jẹ oye.
We will not talk about that anymore.	A kii yoo sọ nipa iyẹn mọ.
We should write it all down.	A yẹ ki a kọ gbogbo eyi silẹ.
It looks like they are here.	O dabi pe wọn wa nibi.
I finished.	Mo ti pari.
I will close the store for a couple of days.	Emi yoo pa ile itaja naa fun ọjọ meji meji.
This does.	Eyi ṣe.
I've been worried for a while there.	Mo n ṣe aniyan fun igba diẹ nibẹ.
It would be a good place for a couple of days.	Yoo jẹ aaye ti o dara fun ọjọ meji kan.
Not that, either.	Kii ṣe iyẹn, boya.
In other words, it’s not the only thing.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, kii ṣe ohun kan nikan.
I just want to talk to you.	Mo kan fẹ lati ba ọ sọrọ.
I don’t want to mother anyone.	Emi ko fẹ lati iya ẹnikẹni.
They were killed for no reason.	Wọn pa laisi idi.
However, we are just getting started.	Sibẹsibẹ, a ti n bẹrẹ.
Tell me the real reason.	So idi ti o daju fun mi.
Breakfast is good for me.	Ounjẹ owurọ dara fun mi.
And make sure he doesn’t feel anything anymore.	Ati rii daju pe ko ni rilara ohunkohun mọ.
We saw him when he was growing up.	A ri i nigbati o ti dagba.
You can pick up the station here after your meal.	O le mu ibudo nibi lẹhin ounjẹ rẹ.
I am going home to bathe.	Mo n lọ si ile lati wẹ.
She must be a city girl.	O gbọdọ jẹ ọmọbirin ilu.
And there are many possible reasons.	Ati pe ọpọlọpọ awọn idi ti o ṣeeṣe wa.
You have a job to do.	O ni iṣẹ kan lati ṣe.
I hold his hand.	Mo di ọwọ rẹ mu.
He thought back on it.	O ronu pada lori rẹ.
This is the best place to do it.	Eyi ni aye ti o dara julọ lati ṣe bẹ.
We have no home, no space.	A ko ni ile, ko si aaye.
Some of them do.	Diẹ ninu wọn ṣe.
I heard it open, did not see it.	Mo ti gbọ ti o ṣii, ko ri i.
See this wisely.	Wo eyi ni ọgbọn.
I told him he was amazing in every way.	Mo sọ fun u pe o jẹ iyanu ni gbogbo ọna.
Man or walk.	Ọkunrin tabi rin.
There is no one to help you.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo ran ọ lọwọ.
I don’t see how that would help.	Emi ko rii bii iyẹn yoo ṣe ṣe iranlọwọ.
It sounds amazing.	O dun iyanu.
We do not know how he died.	A ko mọ bi o ṣe ku.
You did a good job of that.	O ṣe iṣẹ to dara ti iyẹn.
And they will not see us.	Ati pe wọn kii yoo ri wa.
At least it looks like that.	O kere o dabi bẹ.
If we were.	Ti a wà.
They have been great.	Wọn ti jẹ nla.
You have to stop the car.	O ni lati da ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa duro.
They look very young.	Wọn dabi ọmọde pupọ.
Work life.	Igbesi aye iṣẹ.
Students sometimes say the city is a western city.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe nigba miiran sọ pe ilu jẹ ilu ti oorun.
In his heart he was his man.	Ninu ọkan rẹ o jẹ ọkunrin rẹ.
That was one of my favorite things to say.	Iyẹn jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ohun ayanfẹ mi lati sọ.
No way.	Ko ṣee ṣe.
Enjoy our stay.	Gbadun wa duro.
It must be.	O gbọdọ jẹ.
And what else are you looking for.	Ati kini ohun miiran ti o n wa.
We should call the police.	A yẹ ki o pe ọlọpa.
It was thirty minutes behind him.	O jẹ ọgbọn iṣẹju lẹhin rẹ.
Don't talk to me about it!	Maṣe ba mi sọrọ nipa rẹ!
You don’t have to, you know.	O ko ni lati, o mọ.
I remember hurt over injury.	Mo ranti ipalara lori ipalara.
This is not what we need.	Eyi kii ṣe ohun ti a nilo.
Be a woman.	Jẹ obinrin.
Or children then.	Ko yara to.
No one knew that such things could happen.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ pe iru awọn nkan le wa.
The work requires physical.	Iṣẹ naa n beere nipa ti ara.
I will not be here again.	Emi kii yoo wa nibi mọ.
But over time, his strength grew.	Ṣugbọn lẹhin akoko, agbara rẹ dagba.
There are many others.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran wa.
Have fun.	Gba dun.
The company could not make the first games.	Ile-iṣẹ ko le ṣe awọn ere akọkọ.
Everyone must use good judgment.	Gbogbo eniyan gbọdọ lo oye ti o dara.
They are good enough.	Wọn ti dara to.
This is especially true for games.	Eyi jẹ otitọ fun awọn ere.
There is so much to lose.	Nibẹ ni ki Elo ti a padanu.
I have not heard of them.	Emi ko gbọ ti wọn.
He has no power to keep them.	Ko si ni agbara lati pa wọn mọ.
Soon he lost all his money.	Laipẹ o padanu gbogbo owo rẹ.
But that for another day too.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn fun ọjọ miiran paapaa.
I want you to be here with me.	Mo fẹ ki o wa nibi pẹlu mi.
I really like this more than anything.	Mo fẹ eyi gaan ju ohunkohun lọ.
Conviction can get around to.	Idaniloju le gba ni ayika si.
I'm not sure what it is.	Emi ko daju ohun ti o jẹ.
I have no idea.	Emi ko ni imọran rara.
This is, if anything, good news.	Eyi jẹ, ti o ba jẹ ohunkohun, iroyin ti o dara.
And that's right.	Ati pe iyẹn tọ.
I’ll just go with what you’re saying and act now.	Emi yoo kan lọ pẹlu ohun ti o n sọ ati ṣiṣe ni bayi.
I don't want to go into it.	Emi ko fẹ lati lọ sinu rẹ.
Both men were arrested.	Awọn ọkunrin mejeeji ni wọn mu.
I heard you promise as much to your eyes.	Mo ti gbọ o ileri bi Elo si oju rẹ.
Two big rivers meet here.	Odo nla meji pade nibi.
We have to do something, he said.	A ni lati ṣe nkan, o sọ.
They meet for lunch.	Wọn pade fun ounjẹ ọsan.
It should be a dog that sells tail.	O yẹ ki o jẹ aja ti o ta iru.
The sister was very nice to me, like everyone else.	Arabinrin naa dara pupọ si mi, bii gbogbo eniyan miiran.
Observe people when they do not notice you.	Ṣe akiyesi eniyan nigbati wọn ko ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
I can now boot again.	Mo ti le bayi bata lẹẹkansi.
He does not know where he is.	Ko mọ ibi ti o wa.
I could never do such a thing, of course.	Emi ko le ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ rara, dajudaju.
We had to hurry to pick up the bus.	A ni lati sare lati mu ọkọ akero naa.
Not after the fact.	Ko lẹhin ti o daju.
Okay, at your beach house.	O dara, ni ile eti okun rẹ.
This seems surprising.	Eyi dabi iyalẹnu.
Work on it today.	Ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ loni.
There is a better way.	Ọna ti o dara julọ wa.
They are working on it now.	Wọn ti n ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ ni bayi.
We will talk about something else after this holiday.	A yoo sọrọ nipa nkan miiran lẹhin isinmi yii.
Because of the rain.	Nitori ojo.
We tried pretty much everything.	A gbiyanju lẹwa Elo ohun gbogbo.
She wiped her face again.	O tun nu ni oju rẹ lẹẹkansi.
So we asked him that question.	Nitorina a beere ibeere naa fun u.
Here is what you should do.	Eyi ni ohun ti o yẹ ki o ṣe.
A few days, a week is a lot.	Awọn ọjọ diẹ, ọsẹ kan ni pupọ julọ.
You should take life.	O yẹ ki o gba aye.
We are the ones we have been waiting for.	A jẹ awọn ti a ti n duro de.
I have been here ever since.	Mo ti wa nibi lati igba naa.
It seems simple enough.	O dabi rọrun to.
No one is sure when it starts.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o daju nigbati o bẹrẹ.
We learn the works we love and the things we hate.	A kọ awọn iṣẹ ti a fẹran ati ohun ti a korira.
They refuse.	Wọn kọ.
He did not say that this life would be easy.	Ko sọ pe igbesi aye yii yoo rọrun.
He looked over but did not move.	O wo lori ṣugbọn ko gbe.
He had promised to do it, but he did not.	O ti ṣe ileri pe oun yoo ṣe, ṣugbọn ko ṣe.
Everything can happen at that time.	Ohun gbogbo le ṣẹlẹ ni akoko yẹn.
He took the ropes.	O si mu awọn okun.
Your interest is over.	Anfani rẹ ti pari.
You will be able to look out through my eyes.	Iwọ yoo ni anfani lati wo jade nipasẹ oju mi.
However, it does not mean that there is no power in evil.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko tumọ si pe ko si agbara ni ibi.
In some special situations, he said.	Ni diẹ ninu awọn ipo pataki, o sọ.
I need a day's notice.	Mo nilo akiyesi ọjọ kan.
In other words, when you wear it well, you feel good.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, nigbati o ba wọ daradara, o lero dara.
Essentially it has a name and a pair of shoes.	Ni pataki o ni orukọ kan ati bata iye.
He stopped and went back to the song.	O duro o si pada sẹhin si orin naa.
I have closed your eyes.	Mo ti di oju rẹ.
They can't wait to leave.	Wọn ko le duro lati lọ kuro.
Move towards the fire.	Gbe si ọna ina.
And she was too scared to say anything.	Ati pe o bẹru pupọ lati sọ ohunkohun.
I will stay here for you.	Emi yoo duro nibi fun ọ.
He handed it to the police.	O fi fun ọlọpa naa.
Now we turn to the weather.	Bayi a yipada si oju ojo.
There is no power in other places.	Ko si agbara ni awọn aaye miiran.
In fact, a little bit of side information for you.	Ni otitọ, diẹ diẹ ti alaye ẹgbẹ fun ọ.
See attached image.	Wo aworan ti a so.
Even the street girl can eat her food.	Paapaa ọmọbirin ita le jẹ ounjẹ rẹ.
A police officer arrived shortly after the accident.	Ọlọpa kan de ni kete lẹhin ijamba naa.
I just want some time with him.	Mo fẹ diẹ ninu akoko nikan pẹlu rẹ.
He did a lot.	O ṣe pupọ julọ.
He almost went out.	O fẹrẹ jade lọ.
You can try that.	O le gbiyanju iyẹn.
I do not see so.	Emi ko ri bẹ bẹ.
I know they are there.	Mo mọ pe wọn wa nibẹ.
So people are more.	Nitorina eniyan jẹ diẹ sii.
Acquired this day.	Ti gba ọjọ yii.
But of course it is good to hear.	Ṣugbọn o daju pe o dara lati gbọ.
People left their seats for me on the bus.	Awọn eniyan fi awọn ijoko wọn silẹ fun mi lori ọkọ akero.
Can't figure out how to proceed.	Ko le mọ bi o ṣe le tẹsiwaju.
You know, pretty much.	O mọ, o lẹwa gaan.
You have known him since their days in high school.	O ti mọ ọ lati ọjọ wọn ni ile-iwe giga.
They did not drive there.	Wọn ko wakọ nibẹ.
Easy as it gets.	Rọrun bi o ti n gba.
Another year has passed.	Odun miiran ti kọja.
We will pull it out into the physical world.	A yoo fa o jade sinu aye ti ara.
It is easy to understand why.	O rọrun lati ni oye idi idi.
Two men came to help.	Awọn ọkunrin meji wa lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
They say that love does not last.	Wọn sọ pe ifẹ ko pẹ.
The boy is no longer there.	Ọmọkunrin ko si nibẹ mọ.
I just sat and did nothing.	Mo ti o kan joko ati ki o ko se nkankan.
At the moment we need it most.	Ni akoko ti a nilo rẹ julọ.
If you want to say something, say it.	Ti o ba fẹ sọ nkankan, sọ.
Our group is in our city.	Ẹgbẹ wa ni ilu wa.
The edges must be noted.	Awọn eti gbọdọ wa ni akiyesi.
I will give you your site.	Emi yoo fun ọ ni aaye rẹ.
Have to do away with someone less than myself.	Ni lati se kuro pẹlu ẹnikan kekere ju ara mi.
Just lift your head.	Gbe ori rẹ nikan.
I can not change it or how you feel.	Emi ko le yi i pada tabi bi o ṣe lero.
And he would really like to have one.	Ati pe yoo fẹ gaan lati ni ọkan.
I love it so much.	Mo nifẹ rẹ pupọ.
That is not our rule.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ofin wa.
Well look at it now.	Daradara wo o ni bayi.
He did not go.	O ko lo si.
I will just wait to make sure it does.	Emi yoo kan duro lati rii daju pe o ṣe.
They built a new company.	Wọn kọ ile-iṣẹ tuntun kan.
I am not in this for the money.	Emi ko wa ninu eyi fun owo naa.
They are very happy.	Inu won dun pupo.
It does not work.	Ko jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
Don’t try to act like a non-person.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati ṣe bi eniyan kan ti kii ṣe.
Some important, some not so important.	Diẹ ninu awọn pataki, diẹ ninu awọn ko bẹ pataki.
He told me to go.	O ni ki n lọ gaan.
You may not receive any.	O le ma gba eyikeyi.
Boy, that's sure to have some good times.	Ọmọkunrin, iyẹn ni idaniloju diẹ ninu awọn akoko ti o dara.
Give now.	Fun ni bayi.

Money.	Owo.
It is not in the text.	Ko si ninu ọrọ naa.
I learned a lot from her.	Mo kọ ẹkọ pupọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
So of course, you have to do it.	Nitorina dajudaju, o gbọdọ ṣe.
You do not receive notice.	O ko gba akiyesi.

Sorry that the last few days have been hard.	Ma binu pe awọn ọjọ diẹ ti o kẹhin ti le.

Look that up there.	Wo oju yẹn soke nibẹ.
Stories are told in simple past.	Awọn itan ti wa ni so ninu awọn ti o ti kọja rọrun.
There is nothing to be angry about at this point.	Ko ni nkankan lati binu nipa ni aaye yii.
That is not something we think about.	Iyẹn kii ṣe nkan ti a ro nipa.
He is almost dead.	O ti fẹrẹ ku.
You just have to know where you are from.	O kan ni lati mọ ibiti o ti wa.
And now, they start to lock.	Ati ni bayi, wọn bẹrẹ lati tii.
Turn off your heat, do you?	Pa ooru rẹ silẹ, ṣe iwọ?
It seems like a long time.	O dabi igba pipẹ.
I am happy with that.	Inu mi dun si iyẹn.
This great house is a wonderful place to relax.	Ile nla yii jẹ ibi isinmi ti o dun.
He doesn't remember anything.	Ko ranti nkan.
He told me.	O sọ fun mi.
They must be changed.	A gbọdọ yi wọn pada.
You know what it is now.	O mọ ohun ti o jẹ bayi.
For a clean life possible.	Fun igbesi aye ti o mọ ṣee ṣe.
It is not something that everyone else has done in your life.	Ko ṣe ohun ti gbogbo eniyan miiran ti ṣe ni igbesi aye rẹ.
I need to sleep.	Mo nilo lati sun.
My good friends.	Awọn ọrẹ mi to dara.

And he does not understand.	Ati pe ko ṣe oye.
He is your son.	Ọmọ tirẹ̀ ni.
Do not say anything.	Maṣe sọ ohunkohun.
Listen to it, and proceed well.	Gbọ rẹ, ki o si tẹsiwaju daradara.
Everyone is telling the same story.	Gbogbo eniyan n sọ itan kanna.
At least, to be fair.	O kere ju, lati jẹ ki o tọ.
We have to sleep before the next morning.	A ni lati sun ki owurọ to nbọ to de.
And it was just so beautiful.	Ati awọn ti o wà kan ki lẹwa.
And we stopped.	Ati pe a da duro.
Today seems like the right time for you.	Loni dabi akoko ti o tọ fun rẹ.
This is not a test.	Eyi kii ṣe idanwo.

Phone service is what keeps me going.	Iṣẹ foonu ni ohun ti o pa fun mi.
He has been doing this for two years.	O ti n ṣe eyi fun ọdun meji.
Put me into all this trouble for nothing.	Fi mi si gbogbo wahala yi fun ohunkohun.
He did not stay in the world.	Ko duro ni aye.
Anything else we want.	Ohunkohun miiran ni a fẹ.
No errors arose.	Ko si awọn aṣiṣe dide.
He has a young daughter.	O ni ọmọbirin ọdọ kan.
We should have more than that.	A yẹ ki o ni diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
He has great human wisdom.	O ni awọn ọgbọn eniyan nla.
I can not get it anymore.	Nko le gba mo.
Remember when your father made a company?	Ranti nigbati baba rẹ ṣe ile-iṣẹ kan?
He would have wanted to kill him.	Oun yoo ti fẹ lati pa a.
I would agree with that.	Emi yoo gba pẹlu iyẹn.
He told himself that this was his job.	O sọ fun ara rẹ pe iṣẹ rẹ ni eyi.
There must be a good book to read.	Gbọdọ wa iwe ti o dara lati ka.
Just there.	O kan wa nibẹ.
This is an important point of our approach.	Eyi ni aaye pataki ti ọna wa.
We will not walk until we reach the top.	A o ma rin titi a o fi de oke.
It is their job, not my job.	Ise won ni, kii se ise mi.
I could see his face.	Mo ti le ri oju rẹ.
I don’t always but these are pretty good.	Emi kii ṣe nigbagbogbo ṣugbọn awọn wọnyi dara dara.
He was an amazing father.	O jẹ baba iyanu.
But maybe they did not.	Ṣugbọn boya wọn ko ṣe bẹ.
That’s the kind of thing that takes us off the field.	Iyẹn ni iru ohun ti o mu wa kuro ni aaye naa.
I like the new feeling.	Mo fẹran rilara tuntun naa.
It was a wonderful surprise.	O je ohun iyanu ti o tọ.
Now get going.	Bayi gba lọ.
Much has changed.	Pupọ ti yipada.
You do not have enough material to proceed.	O ko ni ohun ti o to lati tẹsiwaju.
They’ve been doing this a lot lately.	Wọn n ṣe eyi pupọ laipẹ.
I understand what you are looking for.	Mo loye ohun ti o n wa.
And in difficult times you may actually know the person.	Ati ni awọn akoko iṣoro o le mọ eniyan gaan.
The young girls seem to like me.	Awọn ọmọbirin ọdọ dabi pe wọn fẹran mi.
Children can understand this.	Awọn ọmọde le ni oye eyi.
That is, if you want to come home.	Iyẹn ni, ti o ba fẹ wa si ile gaan.
However, money is not everything.	Sibẹsibẹ, owo kii ṣe ohun gbogbo.
Be sure to read more about that here.	Rii daju lati ka diẹ sii nipa iyẹn nibi.
He sent her the letter.	O fi lẹta naa ranṣẹ si i.
Let us at least do this for you.	Jẹ ki a ni o kere ṣe eyi fun ọ.
For the most part, it’s not a big deal.	Fun pupọ julọ, kii ṣe adehun nla.
With shoes, small details become even more important.	Pẹlu bata, awọn alaye kekere di paapaa pataki julọ.
The time is up, it's over.	Akoko naa ti lọ, ti pari.
But it is only true if you want it to be.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ otitọ nikan ti o ba fẹ ki o jẹ.
It will change them.	Yoo yi wọn pada.
I am telling you that the gift is for my friend's child.	Mo n sọ fun ọ pe ẹbun naa wa fun ọmọde ọrẹ mi.
Breakfast is available, but no other meals.	Ounjẹ owurọ wa, ṣugbọn ko si awọn ounjẹ miiran.
Nothing was off the table.	Ko si ohun ti o wà pa tabili.
Meet in the morning.	Pade ti owurọ.
You know my skills.	O mọ awọn ọgbọn mi.
Make this day as amazing as you can be.	Ṣe ọjọ yii bi iyanu bi o ṣe le.
Parents want the best for their children.	Awọn obi fẹ ohun ti o dara julọ fun awọn ọmọ wọn.
The question is not that simple.	Ibeere naa ko rọrun yẹn.
It’s something you love.	O jẹ ohun ti o nifẹ.
I would love to have your new book.	Emi yoo nifẹ lati ni iwe tuntun rẹ.
This statement is incorrect.	Ọrọ yii ko tọ.
Both methods can work.	Ọna mejeeji le ṣiṣẹ.
And hurry about it.	Ati ki o yara nipa rẹ.
But they are not yet.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko sibẹsibẹ.
How things changed.	Bawo ni awọn nkan ṣe yipada.
Come on, we have work to do.	Wa, a ni iṣẹ lati ṣe.
I thought for a minute to try to decide what to do.	Mo ronu fun iṣẹju kan lati gbiyanju lati pinnu kini lati ṣe.
In other words, become hard or off.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, di lile tabi pa.
But years passed.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọdun kọja.
Of course not.	O daju pe o ko fẹ.
Stick to something.	Duro si nkankan.
I want others to feel the same way.	Mo fẹ ki awọn miiran lero ni ọna kanna.
It makes me angry.	O binu mi.
Today is not that day.	Loni kii ṣe ọjọ yẹn.
But we have to do the work.	Ṣugbọn a ni lati ṣe iṣẹ naa.
In this way we are able to help the people who are left behind.	Ni ọna yii a ni anfani lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun awọn eniyan ti a fi silẹ.
That is very important.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki julọ.
You get us better.	O gba wa dara.
The news is not good at all.	Iroyin ko dara rara.
He is very angry.	O binu pupọ.
And that is true.	Ati pe otitọ ni iyẹn.
There is no going back.	Ko si pada sẹhin mọ.
I will buy a new pair of shoes today.	Emi yoo ra bata tuntun loni.
He turned his head to one side.	O si yi ori rẹ si ẹgbẹ kan.
However, it can be.	Sibẹsibẹ, o le jẹ.
Make arrangements with him to send information.	Ṣe awọn eto pẹlu rẹ lati fi alaye ranṣẹ.
I don’t know if that tells us anything.	Emi ko mọ boya iyẹn sọ ohunkohun fun wa.
I plan to wear it around the house in the winter.	Mo gbero lati wọ ni ayika ile ni igba otutu.
I will not even try to play this game with you.	Emi kii yoo paapaa gbiyanju lati ṣe ere yii pẹlu rẹ.
And you know me.	Ati pe o mọ mi.
What you write is very simple.	Ohun ti o kọ jẹ rọrun pupọ.
These systems are not easy to use.	Awọn ọna ṣiṣe wọnyi ko rọrun lati lo.
Not used anymore.	Ko lo mo.
But how can this do any good?	Ṣugbọn bawo ni eyi ṣe le ṣe eyikeyi ti o dara?
I tried and both did the same thing.	Mo gbiyanju ati awọn mejeeji ṣe ohun kanna.

He kept his hands up and down.	O pa ọwọ rẹ soke ati isalẹ.
This guy takes his time with this kid down here.	Arakunrin yii gba akoko rẹ pẹlu ọmọde yii si isalẹ nibi.
And yet, it is here.	Ati sibẹsibẹ, o wa nibi.
It’s life, and people change.	O jẹ igbesi aye, ati pe eniyan yipada.
You should tell the police.	O yẹ ki o sọ fun ọlọpa.

Some dogs do and some don’t.	Diẹ ninu awọn aja ṣe ati diẹ ninu awọn ko ṣe.
When he reached my father, he stopped.	Nigbati o de baba mi, o duro.
He thought he would be good at it.	O ro pe oun yoo dara ni rẹ.
It doesn't seem fair to me.	O dabi pe o ko gba mi ni pataki to.
Cars began to stop.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ bẹrẹ si duro.
The driver knew this.	Awakọ naa mọ eyi.
It looks good maybe.	A gan dara boya.
And a little more, it is true.	Ati diẹ diẹ, o jẹ otitọ.
I do not know what would have happened without it.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ laisi rẹ.

There are plans for more.	Awọn eto wa fun diẹ sii.

He is a good friend.	O jẹ ọrẹ to dara.
It was for her sister as well.	O jẹ fun arabinrin rẹ pẹlu.

You don’t want to laugh now.	O ko fẹ lati rẹrin bayi.
I think they are, but maybe not for everyone.	Mo ro pe wọn jẹ, ṣugbọn boya kii ṣe fun gbogbo eniyan.
I waited for my turn.	Mo duro fun akoko mi.
Not completely impossible.	Ko ṣee ṣe patapata.
We must leave the place.	A gbọdọ lọ kuro ni ibi.
A le ge kuro.	A le ge kuro.
That's the only way they really get the ball.	Iyẹn nikan ni ọna ti wọn gba bọọlu gba gaan.
But he was always there.	Sugbon o je nigbagbogbo nibẹ.
This old picture is very important to me.	Aworan atijọ yii ṣe pataki pupọ fun mi.

You have a book.	O ni iwe kan.
We are trying to get back into the game.	A n gbiyanju lati pada si ere naa.

They notice the problem.	Wọn ṣe akiyesi iṣoro naa.
I need to spend some time learning more or understanding more.	Mo nilo lati lo akoko diẹ lati kọ ẹkọ diẹ sii tabi ni oye diẹ sii.
Questions?	Awọn ibeere?
About their mothers.	Nipa awọn iya wọn.
Hours after hours passed, but they tried again.	Wakati lẹhin wakati kọja, ṣugbọn wọn tun gbiyanju.
They don't need it anymore.	Wọn ko nilo rẹ mọ.
Nobody wants you to sleep.	Ko si ẹniti o fẹ ki o sun.
They are about.	Wọn ti wa ni nipa.
The group started the journey well.	Ẹgbẹ naa bẹrẹ irin-ajo naa daradara.
He loves her very much.	O feran re pupo.
He would sit and look into the space.	Oun yoo joko ati ki o wo sinu aaye.
Now think about other things.	Bayi ro nipa awọn ohun miiran.
It was a small boat.	O jẹ ọkọ oju omi kekere kan.

It just won't leave the phone.	O kan yoo ko kuro ni foonu.
This is a growing house.	Eyi ni ile ti o dagba.
And you only want one.	Ati ki o fẹ ọkan nikan.
Whatever you do, don’t let your wife see any of these.	Ohunkohun ti o ba ṣe, ma ṣe jẹ ki iyawo rẹ ri eyikeyi ninu awọn wọnyi.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe nipa iyẹn.
Do not make that look.	Maṣe ṣe oju yẹn.
But his body is fine, he said.	Ṣugbọn ara rẹ dara, o sọ.
It will take about a minute.	Yoo gba to iṣẹju kan.
It has many types.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn iru.
I look up at the clock.	Mo wo soke ni aago.
So they did what they could.	Nitorina wọn ṣe ohun ti wọn le.
I really like the program.	Mo feran eto naa gaan.
This kid is better than even think he is.	Ọmọde yii dara julọ ju paapaa ro pe o jẹ.
And it’s nothing more than that.	Ati pe kii ṣe nkan diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
It was not hard.	O je ko lile.
This is the same for people.	Eyi jẹ kanna fun eniyan.
However, we are here.	Sibẹsibẹ, a wa nibi.
It will not matter.	Kii yoo ṣe pataki.
So they knocked out.	Nitorina wọn lu jade.
It’s a pretty small thing.	O jẹ ohun kekere ti o lẹwa.
They have two weeks.	Wọn ni ọsẹ meji.
He’s on his own right now.	O wa lori ara rẹ gaan ni bayi.

Education is amazing if you open your mind to it.	Ẹkọ jẹ ohun iyanu ti o ba ṣii ọkan rẹ si.
He needs us as we need him.	O nilo wa bi a ṣe nilo rẹ.
She decided to help the dog.	O pinnu lati ran aja lọwọ.

It all depends on you.	Gbogbo nkan da lori rẹ.
He was given special positions.	O si ti a fi fun awọn ipo ti pataki.
My goal is to finish my work here.	Ero mi ni lati pari iṣẹ mi nibi.
He hated school.	O korira ile-iwe.
But do, you hope.	Ṣugbọn ṣe, o nireti.
I almost took the time to leave.	Mo ti fẹrẹ gba aye lati lọ kuro.
Drink! 	Mu!
We'll just move.	A yoo kan gbe.
I can not get up completely.	Emi ko le dide patapata.
But he believes he is right.	Ṣugbọn o gbagbọ pe o tọ.
The world changed but it did not.	Aye yipada ṣugbọn ko ṣe.
But do as you must.	Ṣugbọn ṣe bi o ṣe gbọdọ.
At that time you can wait.	Ni akoko yẹn o le duro.
That is very easy to cut off.	Iyẹn rọrun pupọ lati ge kuro.
You take them, you live with them, you let them come.	O gba wọn, o ba wọn gbe, jẹ ki wọn wa.
Tell him I am.	Sọ fun u pe emi ni.
You don’t stop to think about it.	O ko duro lati ronu nipa rẹ.

Someone had that picture.	Ẹnikan ni aworan yẹn.
There are people.	Awon eniyan wa.
Feeling power in your eyes.	Rilara agbara ni oju rẹ.
It is not finished.	O ti ko ti pari.
He looked at his daughter.	O wo ọmọbirin rẹ.
That comes from the bottom up.	Iyẹn wa lati isalẹ soke.
I just live in it.	Mo kan gbe ninu rẹ.
But that is not true.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
He stood back.	O duro sẹhin.
Get up early, have breakfast for yourself.	Dide ni kutukutu, ṣe ounjẹ owurọ fun ara rẹ.
I got into it.	Mo wọ inu rẹ.
They hope to do the impossible.	Wọn nireti lati ṣe ohun ti ko ṣeeṣe.
In fact, it is very simple.	Ni otitọ, o rọrun pupọ.
Because it is.	Nitori o jẹ.
I notice that learning is easier when there is work to be done.	Mo ṣe akiyesi pe ẹkọ jẹ rọrun nigbati iṣẹ ṣiṣe wa.
We will look around for some today.	A yoo wo ni ayika fun diẹ ninu loni.
They have many.	Wọn ni ọpọlọpọ.
Nothing to do, nothing to do.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣe, ko si nkankan lati ṣee.
Please read the book.	Jọwọ ka iwe naa.
He will see you.	O yoo ri ọ.
He had a great game last week.	O ni ere nla kan ni ọsẹ to kọja.
We watched the game.	A wo ere naa.
However the injury forced him to miss the end of his first season.	Sibẹsibẹ ipalara fi agbara mu u lati padanu ipari akoko akọkọ rẹ.
I sat down.	Mo joko.

Small boxes, on top.	Awọn apoti kekere, lori oke.
We cannot do without them.	A ko le ṣe laisi wọn.
We do not want it.	A ko fẹ rẹ.
So young and beautiful.	Ki odo ati ki o lẹwa.

It's too late for your train.	O pẹ fun ọkọ oju irin rẹ.
Water is used to clean the saw.	Omi ti wa ni lo lati nu awọn ri.
Sit down, sit back.	Joko, joko sẹhin.
He did his job.	O ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
I don’t have time to hear your stories right now.	Emi ko ni akoko lati gbọ awọn itan rẹ ni bayi.
Give it some thought.	Fun o diẹ ninu awọn ero.
Hair on it long before you have any on it.	Irun lori rẹ gun ṣaaju ki o ni eyikeyi lori rẹ.
A woman was there too.	Obinrin kan wa nibẹ pẹlu.
It doesn’t make any sense.	Ko ṣe ori eyikeyi.
Do nothing until you hear from me again.	Maṣe ṣe ohunkohun titi iwọ o fi tun gbọ lati ọdọ mi lẹẹkansi.
This is what we would expect.	Eyi jẹ ohun ti a yoo reti.
It has been going on for a long time.	O ti lọ fun igba pipẹ.

They’ve heard, and some ages are better than others.	Wọn ti gbọ, ati diẹ ninu awọn ọjọ ori dara ju awọn miiran lọ.
And he would tell me.	Ati pe oun yoo sọ fun mi.
These can not be found.	Awọn wọnyi ko le ri.

It is powered by.	O gba agbara nipasẹ.
Do not believe the stories about us.	Maṣe gbagbọ awọn itan nipa wa.
We do not want children at all.	A ko fẹ awọn ọmọde rara.
He was a very good student.	O jẹ ọmọ ile-iwe ti o dara pupọ.
His head is down.	Ori rẹ wa ni isalẹ.
It is very powerful.	O ni agbara pupọ.
Do not be afraid to ask hard questions.	Maṣe bẹru lati beere awọn ibeere lile.
There is nothing wrong with it at all.	Ko si ohun ti ko tọ si pẹlu o ni gbogbo.
It is very important.	O ṣe pataki pupọ.
Or you may not like it.	Tabi o le ma fẹ rẹ.
Let things not be done for you.	Jẹ ki awọn nkan ti a ko ṣe fun ọ lọ.
We are also friends, but not to kill.	A tun jẹ ọrẹ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe lati pa.

It was a good program, he said to himself.	O jẹ eto ti o dara, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
Be sure to use as much as possible outside.	Rii daju lati lo bi o ti ṣee ṣe ni ita.
I have heard that the food is good.	Mo ti gbọ pe ounjẹ naa dara.
It makes us really laugh.	O mu wa rẹrin gaan.
I told myself to keep my head down.	Mo ti so fun ara mi lati pa mi ori.
I'm still trying to figure out what that might be.	Mo tun n gbiyanju lati ro ero kini iyẹn le jẹ.
I would not believe that.	Emi kii yoo gbagbọ pe.

Anything is possible.	Ohunkohun ṣee ṣe.

He did not continue with it.	Ko tẹsiwaju pẹlu rẹ.
He kept his eyes on her.	O pa oju rẹ mọ lori rẹ.
You learn to go alone.	O kọ ẹkọ lati lọ nikan.
I left them for him.	Mo fi wọn silẹ fun u.
It seemed to have a purpose.	O dabi enipe o ni idi kan.
I have only my own.	Mo ni ti ara mi nikan.
We just took some beautiful pictures and one day.	A kan ya awọn aworan lẹwa ati pe ni ọjọ kan.
They have gone too far.	Wọn ti kọja pupọ.
Remember this is for testing.	Ranti eyi jẹ fun idanwo.
He gives His power to all of us.	O fi agbara re fun gbogbo wa.
It is used with love.	O ti lo pẹlu ife.
It works great.	O ṣiṣẹ nla.
Someone has to be a non-human being.	Ẹnikan ni lati jẹ eniyan ti kii ṣe.
He hated his job.	O korira iṣẹ rẹ.
But they are no longer male and female.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko jẹ ọkunrin ati obinrin mọ.
We need to find a way to stop them.	A nilo lati wa ọna lati da wọn duro.
Maria, decide it.	Maria, pinnu rẹ.
We passed on board.	A kọja lori ọkọ.
They mean it.	Wọn tumọ rẹ.
I have seen that happen to many girls here.	Mo ti rii iyẹn ṣẹlẹ si ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọbirin nibi.
There are also items that cannot be moved.	Awọn ohun kan tun wa ti ko le gbe.
Now, look at the following.	Bayi, wo awọn wọnyi.
We do not know what we will see.	A ko mọ ohun ti a yoo ri.
We were on the beach.	A wà lori eti okun.
It may not be new.	O le ma jẹ tuntun.
I think it can work out.	Mo ro pe o le ṣiṣẹ jade.
Just long on.	O kan gun lori.
I know, I am neither.	Mo mọ, emi bẹni.
It gives us a new way to do it.	O fun wa ni ọna tuntun lati ṣe.
But I believe there are many ways to reach people.	Ṣugbọn mo gbagbọ pe ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna wa lati de ọdọ awọn eniyan.
He drove to the bus station.	O wakọ lọ si ibudo ọkọ akero.
If you want to stay with me, you better learn to listen.	Ti o ba fẹ duro pẹlu mi, o dara julọ kọ ẹkọ lati gbọ.
It is impossible to say.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati sọ.
I do not like this.	Emi ko fẹran eyi.
You can not do everything.	O ko le ṣe ohun gbogbo.
You should read everything you can get your hands on.	O yẹ ki o ka ohun gbogbo ti o le gba ọwọ rẹ lori.
You go too.	Iwọ naa lọ.
I have to go sell this.	Mo ni lati lọ ta eyi.
It was a very special day.	O ṣe ọjọ pataki pupọ.
He’s a really big guy, the right person.	O jẹ eniyan nla gaan, ẹni to tọ.
I live better in two houses than in one.	Mo n gbe dara ni ile meji ju ni ọkan.
Nothing is known about his life.	Ko si ohun ti a mọ nipa igbesi aye rẹ.
Let’s start with.	Jẹ ki a bẹrẹ pẹlu.
Grandfather is a father.	Baba nla ni baba.
I will stay with the children.	Emi yoo duro pẹlu awọn ọmọde.
I don't work with it at all.	Emi ko ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ rara.
It may sound simple, but it is not.	O le dun rọrun, ṣugbọn kii ṣe.
If you need anything else you know how to contact.	Ti o ba nilo ohunkohun miiran o mọ bi o ṣe le kan si.
I know a lot of people who use it.	Mo mọ ọpọlọpọ eniyan ti o lo.
He put the phone on his head.	O fi foonu si ori.
As would be expected.	Bi yoo ti ṣe yẹ.
I noticed this year at your school there weren’t a lot of great people.	Mo ṣe akiyesi ni ọdun yii ni ile-iwe rẹ ko ni ọpọlọpọ eniyan nla.
And move.	Ati ki o gbe.
I was sent to the doctor.	Won ran mi si dokita.
Tested.	Ti idanwo idanwo.
That other driver also died.	Awakọ miiran yẹn naa ku.
Do not call the police.	Maṣe pe awọn ọlọpa.
We will wait for you, if you wish.	A yoo duro fun ọ, ti o ba fẹ.
Your new location requires you to travel regularly.	Ipo tuntun rẹ beere pe ki o rin irin-ajo nigbagbogbo.
The same is true for us.	Ohun kan naa ni otitọ fun wa.
There is no obvious path to where we want to go.	Ko si ọna ti o han gbangba si ibiti a fẹ lọ.
It doesn’t make sense to him.	Ko ṣe ori fun u.
We have what it takes to be the best.	A ni ohun ti o nilo lati jẹ ti o dara julọ.
I'm trying to do the same thing.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ṣe ohun kanna.
It was just what he needed at the time.	Oun kan jẹ ohun ti o nilo ni akoko yẹn.
They went for an hour like this.	Wọn lọ fun wakati kan bii eyi.
Maybe not.	Boya kii yoo ṣe.
Or something else completely.	Tabi ohun miiran patapata.
They live at the moment.	Wọn n gbe ni akoko naa.
But you can see.	Sugbon o le ri.
Obviously not happy with me.	O han gbangba pe ko dun pẹlu mi.
It has gone a long way.	O ti lọ ni ọna pipẹ pupọ.
I found nothing but good from all of this.	Mo ti ri nkankan sugbon o dara lati gbogbo awọn ti yi.
The wood is really hard.	Awọn igi jẹ gan lile.
Don’t do your job, it takes you for granted.	Maṣe fi iṣẹ rẹ ṣe, o gba ọ ni imọran.
He made the game hard.	O ṣe ere naa lile.
If you have any suggestions, please let us know.	Ti o ba ni imọran, jọwọ jẹ ki a mọ.
People here live a simple life.	Awọn eniyan nibi n gbe igbesi aye ti o rọrun.
Killed by my own hands.	Pa nipa ọwọ ara mi.
Of course your class is late.	Dajudaju kilasi rẹ ti pẹ.
But the wife said she had to go.	Ṣugbọn iyawo sọ pe o ni lati lọ.
He has lost his way.	O ti padanu ọna rẹ.
In this case, not much.	Ni idi eyi, kii ṣe pupọ.
That just helps you get past the other day.	Iyẹn kan ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ lati kọja ọjọ miiran.
You have received their money.	O ti gba owo wọn.
That makes it a lot of people.	Iyẹn jẹ ki o jẹ eniyan pupọ.
I only go to meetings every day.	Mo ti lọ si ipade nikan ni gbogbo ọjọ.
I use it a lot.	Mo lo o pupọ.
Such work is unlikely to happen.	Iru iṣẹ ṣiṣe ko ṣeeṣe lati ṣẹlẹ.
It’s something we were born to do.	O jẹ ohun ti a bi lati ṣe.
But that would be everything else.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn yoo jẹ gbogbo nkan miiran.
I just received the money.	Mo kan gba owo naa.
For their talk continue to talk to us.	Fun ọrọ wọn tẹsiwaju lati ba wa sọrọ.
He found out that the first day they met.	O si ri wipe jade ni akọkọ ọjọ ti won pade.
Things may have gone the other way.	Awọn nkan le ti lọ ni ọna miiran.
Now she gave birth to a baby boy.	Bayi o bi ọmọ kan.
They know everything that is going on around them.	Wọn mọ ohun gbogbo ti n ṣẹlẹ ni ayika wọn.
But the details are not the point.	Ṣugbọn awọn alaye kii ṣe aaye naa.
I want to learn and grow.	Mo fẹ lati kọ ẹkọ ati dagba.
I have something to do.	Mo ni nkankan lati se.
It is a big house.	O jẹ ile nla kan.
These people, more than anything, are my friends.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi, diẹ sii ju ohunkohun lọ, wọn jẹ ọrẹ mi.
Try to kill it.	Gbiyanju lati pa a.
So he will walk.	Nitorina oun yoo rin.
It was quite interesting.	O je ohun awon.
It works really well.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara daradara.
Wear your best clothes.	Wọ aṣọ rẹ ti o dara julọ.
It's long.	O gun.
It tells a story about the past.	O sọ itan kan nipa ohun ti o ti kọja.
It’s not that you’ve slept too much the night before.	Kii ṣe pe o ti sun pupọ ni alẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
No time.	Ko si akoko.
I know more than you do.	Mo mọ diẹ sii ju iwọ lọ.
It’s not always a good thing.	Kii ṣe ohun ti o dara nigbagbogbo.
What a wonderful story!	Kini itan iyalẹnu kan!
They have been married two or three times.	Wọn ti ṣe igbeyawo ni igba meji tabi mẹta.
My imagination is amazing.	Oju inu mi jẹ iyanu.
Apparently he had not heard.	O han pe ko ti gbọ.
The new baby is not like his father or mother.	Ọmọ tuntun naa ko dabi baba tabi iya rẹ.
They are usually students for dinner.	Nigbagbogbo wọn jẹ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe fun ounjẹ alẹ.
This can happen for several reasons.	Eyi le ṣẹlẹ fun awọn idi pupọ.
One month turns into one year.	Oṣu kan yipada si ọdun kan.
I did not even try to talk to him at this point.	Emi ko paapaa gbiyanju lati ba a sọrọ ni aaye yii.
I have not heard before.	Emi ko tii gbọ tẹlẹ.
Tell him that when he leaves, we will never forget him.	Sọ fun u pe nigbati o ba lọ, a ko ni gbagbe rẹ.
But they have nothing else to lose.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko ni nkan miiran lati padanu.
At least it was good by me.	O kere o dara nipasẹ mi.
The future, the past, they are no longer your concern.	Ojo iwaju, ti o ti kọja, wọn kii ṣe aniyan rẹ mọ.
So, it’s not just about money.	Nitorina, kii ṣe nipa owo nikan.
So there we have a hand.	Nitorina nibẹ a ni ọwọ kan.
Almost long.	O fẹrẹ to gun.
They are not forgotten, even if you do.	Wọn ko gbagbe, paapaa ti o ba ṣe.
Learn more.	Kọ ẹkọ diẹ si.
How you go about this is yours.	Bi o ṣe lọ nipa eyi jẹ tirẹ.
I should have watched them with it.	Mo yẹ ki n ti wo wọn pẹlu rẹ.
There have been very few.	O ti wa pupọ diẹ.
That's when things start to get interesting.	Ti o ni nigbati ohun bẹrẹ lati gba awon.
He does not want to stop.	Ko fe duro.
And so on.	Ati bẹ naa.
They did not ask him if he wanted to.	Wọn ko beere lọwọ rẹ boya o fẹ.
Here things are going well.	Nibi ohun ti n lọ daradara.
I know this is not what we intended to be.	Mo mọ pe eyi kii ṣe ohun ti a pinnu lati jẹ.
And it killed me to see you like that.	Ati pe o pa mi lati ri ọ bi iyẹn.
It's time to dump her and move on.	O to akoko lati yi pada.
This is easier said than done.	Eyi rọrun ju bi o ti n dun lọ.
I have decided my heart.	Mo ti pinnu ọkan mi.
Most people do.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ṣe bẹ.
But in the end he did not catch up.	Sugbon ni ipari o ko ti mu.
But that day is over.	Ṣugbọn ọjọ yẹn ti pẹ.
They know how to run the program.	Wọn mọ bi wọn ṣe le ṣiṣẹ eto naa.
There is more food to eat.	Ounjẹ diẹ wa lati jẹ.
Everything, anything, that's what we're here for.	Ohun gbogbo, ohunkohun, ti o ni ohun ti a ba nibi fun.
That if you do, that will.	Pe ti o ba ṣe bẹ, iyẹn yoo.
But this is great.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ nla.
Also buy a nice dress for me.	Tun ra aṣọ to dara fun mi.
We think about that.	A ro nipa iyẹn.
Whether they like it or not.	Boya wọn fẹ tabi rara.
Try it on.	Gbiyanju o lori.
I do not know that.	Emi ko mọ pe.
What's wrong?.	Kini aṣiṣe?.
A car is driving on a road.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan wakọ ni opopona kan.
Who lives here?	Tani o ngbe nibi?
We talk about it.	A sọrọ nipa rẹ.
I learned this from your book.	Mo kọ eyi lati inu iwe rẹ.
Love is not harmful.	Ifẹ kii ṣe ipalara.
What makes music so beautiful?	Kini o jẹ ki orin lẹwa?
If you want to do more, work harder.	Ti o ba fẹ ṣe diẹ sii, ṣiṣẹ diẹ sii.
I will give you a gift.	Emi yoo fun ọ ni ẹbun kan.
They are only available as classes.	Wọn wa nikan bi awọn kilasi.
They have no musical power.	Wọn ko ni agbara orin.
It grew hard again.	O dagba lile lẹẹkansi.
This house is beautiful.	Ile yi lẹwa.
Not a single car at all.	Ko kan nikan ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ni gbogbo pupo.
These are the people who go to school as well.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn eniyan ti o lọ si ile-iwe pẹlu.
I watched them with amazement.	Mo ti wo wọn pẹlu iyanu.
I know the area better than you.	Mo mọ agbegbe naa dara julọ ju ọ lọ.
Now you have two.	Bayi o ni meji.
And you can do that.	Ati pe o le ṣe bẹ.
I have breakfast.	Mo ṣe ounjẹ owurọ.
It is something we truly believe.	O jẹ ohun ti a gbagbọ ni otitọ.
She sits alone in the garden.	O joko nikan ni ọgba.
It seemed a little easier with it away.	O dabi enipe diẹ rọrun pẹlu rẹ kuro.
You probably spend a lot of time planning.	O ṣee ṣe ki o lo akoko pupọ julọ lati gbero.
If they ask you how you feel.	Ti wọn ba beere lọwọ rẹ bi o ṣe lero.
I am walking.	Mo n rin.
Just bad.	O kan buburu.
What you need is what you need.	Ohun ti o nilo ni ohun ti o nilo.
If you do it right.	Ti o ba ṣe o tọ.
I have no power or want to see it.	Emi ko ni agbara tabi fẹ lati ri i.
Not, of course.	Kii ṣe, dajudaju.
I will have to try my best.	Emi yoo ni lati gbiyanju gbogbo agbara mi.
Is that so.	Ṣe iyẹn jẹ.
She closed her eyes, and began to change her clothes.	O di oju rẹ, o si bẹrẹ si yi aṣọ rẹ pada.
Sometimes, you should never put that into an application.	Nigba miiran, o yẹ ki o ma fi iyẹn sinu ohun elo kan.
But he was also very upset.	Sugbon o je tun gan inu.
It will change people to us.	Yoo yi eniyan pada si wa.
She was a teacher at my school.	O jẹ olukọ ni ile-iwe mi.
It has given me so much more than you think it has.	O ti fun mi ni pupọ diẹ sii ju ti o ro pe o ni.
Call me back.	Pe mi pada.
I quickly learned to stand still.	Mo yara kọ ẹkọ lati duro jẹ.
Tell me more about the last holiday.	Sọ fun mi diẹ sii nipa isinmi ti o kẹhin.
He is here to help her.	O wa nibi lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
This statement is incorrect.	Ọrọ yii ko tọ.
We did something together about the dog we visited.	A ṣe nkan papọ nipa aja ti a ṣabẹwo.
I lost my baby.	Mo padanu ọmọ mi.
It already exists and is reopened.	O ti wa tẹlẹ ati pe a tun ṣii.
Tell you what, let's go.	Sọ fun ọ kini, jẹ ki a lọ.
They can't keep you.	Wọn ko le pa ọ mọ.
I know you do.	Mo mọ pe o ṣe.
It is in their contract.	O wa ninu iwe adehun wọn.
Please let them come.	Jọwọ jẹ ki wọn wa.
Which probably can’t do with me.	Eyi ti o ṣee ṣe ko le ṣe pẹlu mi.
We know that.	A mọ iyẹn.
Of course here is a mistake.	Dajudaju nibi jẹ aṣiṣe kan.
The other boys laughed.	Awọn ọmọkunrin miiran rẹrin rẹrin.
No one has seen an idea.	Ko si ọkan ti ri ero kan.
There are many others, too.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran jẹ, paapaa.
What would you do if they gave you this money?	Kini iwọ yoo ṣe ti wọn ba fun ọ ni owo yii?
My children have to eat.	Awọn ọmọ mi ni lati jẹun.
He was the last to arrive.	Oun ni o kẹhin lati de.
I'll just finish this and be on my way.	Emi yoo kan pari eyi ki o si wa ni ọna mi.
The garden is in the backyard.	Ọgba naa wa ni ẹhin ile naa.
I'm looking at this moment in time.	Mo n wo akoko yii ni akoko.
I should have started this a long time ago.	Mo yẹ ki o ti bẹrẹ eyi ni igba pipẹ sẹhin.
I believe that is how it should be.	Mo ti gbagbọ pe iyẹn ni bi o ṣe yẹ ki o jẹ.
The room is too hot.	Yara naa ti gbona ju.
I am not sure how small this amount is.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bawo ni iye yii ṣe kere to.
So you don’t like them.	Nitorina o ko fẹran wọn.
What would people think about it?	Kini eniyan yoo ro nipa rẹ?
Small becomes big and big becomes small.	Kekere di nla ati nla di kekere.
You can see their faces better.	O le rii oju wọn dara julọ.
But the news is not all bad.	Ṣugbọn awọn iroyin ni ko gbogbo buburu.
Let them go.	Jẹ ki wọn lọ.
That will require a new system.	Iyẹn yoo nilo eto tuntun kan.
It’s best to let him believe that.	O dara julọ lati jẹ ki o gbagbọ pe.
I decided to put them on.	Mo pinnu lati fi wọn sii.
And good if you good.	Ati pe o dara ti o ba dara.
I'll try that.	Emi yoo gbiyanju iyẹn.
His grandfather told stories through fire.	Baba baba rẹ sọ awọn itan nipasẹ ina.
I can change.	Mo le yi pada.
Both of them rose.	Mejeeji le dide.
He will do.	Oun yoo ṣe.
Or they are not in a better world.	Tabi wọn ko wa ni aye to dara julọ.
The days passed without any food.	Awọn ọjọ kọja laisi ounjẹ eyikeyi.
We don’t want to think about that.	A ko fẹ lati ronu nipa iyẹn.
You are the only one.	Iwọ nikan ni.
Easy to learn.	Rọrun lati kọ ẹkọ.
You deserve better than you.	O tọ si dara ju iwọ lọ.
Sorry about that.	Binu rẹ kuro.
I need to tell you everything.	Mo nilo lati so fun o ohun gbogbo.
One book at a time.	Iwe kan ni akoko kan.
You will make a wonderful husband and father one day.	Iwọ yoo ṣe ọkọ ati baba iyanu ni ọjọ kan.
The most amazing thing for any man.	Ohun iyanu julọ fun eyikeyi ọkunrin.
It was a lot of fun to see other teams on it.	O jẹ ohun ti o dun pupọ lati rii awọn ẹgbẹ miiran lori rẹ.
Your advice is a little helpful.	Imọran rẹ jẹ iranlọwọ diẹ.
You will never want one again.	Iwọ kii yoo fẹ ọkan mọ.
Friends come through work.	Awọn ọrẹ wa nipasẹ iṣẹ.
Make me wonder.	Fi mi ṣe iyalẹnu.
This will benefit me.	Eyi yoo ṣe anfani fun mi.
We have to submit our application next week.	A ni lati fi ohun elo wa lọwọ ni ọsẹ ti n bọ.
The lyrics are under the hood.	Awọn ọrọ wa labẹ orin.
I would love to see both of them again.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ri awọn mejeeji lẹẹkansi.
I love a lot of things.	Mo nifẹ ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
But in a small but important way, it’s worth it.	Ṣugbọn ni ọna kekere kan ṣugbọn pataki, o tọ.
I will be after you.	Emi yoo wa lẹhin rẹ.
Love them well if they want more children.	Fẹ wọn daradara ti wọn ba fẹ awọn ọmọde diẹ sii.
It's really happening.	O ti n ṣẹlẹ gaan.
And you have a reason for everything.	Ati pe o ni idi kan fun ohun gbogbo.

It should also be no.	O yẹ ki o tun jẹ rara.
Can do everything.	Le ṣe ohun gbogbo.
I can't understand why this happened.	Emi ko le loye idi ti nkan yii fi ṣẹlẹ.
Feeling great today.	Rilara pupọ loni.
Some let it work and some don’t.	Diẹ ninu awọn jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ ati diẹ ninu awọn ko ṣe.
It's fast.	O yara di.
He said a word.	O sọ ọrọ kan.
Two of them will never do so with him again.	Meji ninu wọn kii yoo tun ṣe bẹ pẹlu rẹ lẹẹkansi.
I'll have this.	Emi yoo gba eyi.
Just because I can.	O kan nitori Mo le.
You know the system.	O mọ eto naa.
Do you see a watch?	Ṣe o ri aago kan?
And don’t be upset that these two people.	Ki o si ma ṣe binu pe awọn eniyan meji wọnyi.
Maybe it did nothing or the door.	Boya ko ṣe nkankan tabi ti ilẹkun.
I know you don’t mean.	Mo mọ pe o ko tumọ si.
Now their time, and their man, has come.	Bayi akoko wọn, ati ọkunrin wọn, ti de.
And they all did not decide.	Ati pe gbogbo wọn ko tun pinnu.
No one there.	Ko si enikeni nibẹ.
In the man.	Ni ọkunrin naa.
It is better to keep that before your father sees it.	O dara ki o tọju iyẹn ṣaaju ki baba rẹ to rii.
I like music.	Mo dun orin.
Across the street.	Kọja awọn ita.
You need to know.	O nilo lati mọ.
However, he must be the right man.	Sibẹsibẹ, o gbọdọ jẹ ọkunrin ti o tọ.
These past few days were pretty fun.	Awọn wọnyi ti o ti kọja diẹ ọjọ wà lẹwa fun.
When cooking, cook.	Nigbati o ba n ṣe ounjẹ, ṣe ounjẹ.
It was my time to wait for the right thing.	O jẹ akoko mi lati duro fun ohun ti o tọ.
Or something like that.	Tabi nkankan bi wipe.
Still, he doesn’t like it.	Ṣi ọdọ, o ko fẹran rẹ.
All done now so jump out.	Gbogbo awọn ti ṣe bayi ki fo jade.
A what if.	A kini ti o ba jẹ.
I could not hear a word spoken.	Emi ko le gbọ ọrọ kan ti o sọ.
It’s been weeks since we last talked.	O ti jẹ ọsẹ lati igba ti a ti sọrọ kẹhin.
I think they are a great company.	Mo ro pe wọn jẹ ile-iṣẹ nla kan.
If you can't find that, ask.	Ti o ko ba le rii iyẹn, beere.
We were all dressed up.	Gbogbo wa ni a wọ aṣọ.
I walked through his eyes.	Mo ti rin nipasẹ oju rẹ.
I don't know where he caught them.	Emi ko mọ ibiti o ti di wọn mu.
But not to be.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe lati jẹ.
For her time, she has been around.	Fun u akoko, o ti wa ni ayika.
Should have paid more attention in class.	Yẹ ki o ti san diẹ akiyesi ni kilasi.
This is the next morning.	Eyi ni owurọ owurọ.
And it will benefit you.	Ati pe yoo ṣe anfani fun ọ.
Your goal is to have your own company one day.	Ipinnu rẹ ni lati ni ile-iṣẹ tirẹ ni ọjọ kan.
But there are several methods that work better than this.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọna pupọ lo wa ti o ṣiṣẹ daradara ju eyi lọ.
Don't let me hit you.	Maṣe jẹ ki n lu ọ.
It's not your thing.	Kii ṣe nkan tirẹ.
For a couple of days.	Fun ọjọ meji kan.
He even called the police.	Paapaa o pe ọlọpa si mi.
Which is good.	Eyi ti o dara.
You are right in your own way.	O tọ ni ọna tirẹ.
They will go down to meet us, as we go.	Wọn yoo lọ si isalẹ lati pade wa, bi a ti lọ.
But with the temptation we are tempted, and with the temptation we will be saved.	Ṣugbọn pẹlu ti ara ẹni ni idanwo wa, ati pẹlu idanwo ni aṣiṣe wa.
They need to find friends, and room.	Wọn nilo lati wa awọn ọrẹ, ati yara.
A week ago.	Ni ọsẹ kan sẹhin.
I should not say such things.	Emi ko yẹ ki n sọ iru awọn nkan bẹẹ.
No thought was given to his wishes.	Ko si ero ti a fi fun awọn ifẹ rẹ.
Let me think on this some more.	Jẹ ki mi ro lori yi diẹ ninu awọn diẹ.
At that point.	Ni aaye ti.
It should never have been left to you.	Ko yẹ ki o ti fi silẹ fun ọ rara.
More dogs than cats live in the city.	Awọn aja diẹ sii ju awọn ologbo n gbe ni ilu naa.
Nothing changed inside.	Ko si ohun ti o yipada ninu inu.
I don’t want to promise anything.	Emi ko fẹ lati ṣe ileri ohunkohun.
It makes you feel there for you.	O jẹ ki o lero pe o wa nibẹ fun ọ.
I stopped at this seat, by the way.	Mo duro si ijoko yii, nipasẹ ọna.
He was the first one up.	O jẹ ẹni akọkọ soke.
You want it fast.	O fẹ ki o yara.
We've had enough of it.	A ti sọ to rẹ.
That, and because he asked me.	Iyẹn, ati nitori pe o beere lọwọ mi.
Everything arrived on time and we picked up without problems.	Ohun gbogbo ti de ni akoko ati pe a gbe soke laisi awọn iṣoro.
Children playing outside.	Awọn ọmọde n ṣe ere ni ita.
In one area, leave.	Ni agbegbe kan, lọ kuro.
But more than that.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
I thought.	Mo ti ro pe.
If you are in a bad job, try to give up.	Ti o ba wa ni iṣẹ buburu, gbiyanju lati fi silẹ.
Wear comfortable clothing.	Wọ aṣọ to dara.
They cannot eat at the same lunches.	Wọn ko le jẹun ni awọn ibi ounjẹ ọsan kanna.
And it’s kind of amazing.	Ati pe o jẹ iru iyalẹnu.
Refuse to explain.	Kọ lati se alaye.

No need to.	Ko nilo lati.
See what you do.	Wo ohun ti o ṣe.
And we hope you come back.	Ati pe a nireti pe o pada wa.
I just left for a few days.	Mo kan kuro fun awọn ọjọ diẹ.

She grew up a single child.	O dagba soke kan nikan ọmọ.
These are not little men.	Awọn wọnyi kii ṣe awọn ọkunrin kekere.
I want it from my hand.	Mo fẹ lati ọwọ mi.
She is his mother.	O jẹ iya rẹ.
We stuck to each other for a long time, we said nothing.	A di ara wa fun igba pipẹ, a sọ ohunkohun.
I do not have a daughter.	Emi ko ni ọmọbirin kan.
I can't sit still.	Emi ko le joko jẹ.
They may have said something.	Wọn le ti sọ nkankan.
That makes me look even sadder.	Iyẹn jẹ ki o dabi ẹni ti o dun mi paapaa.
He was afraid of the sea.	O si bẹru ti awọn okun.
I do not want to leave the face.	Emi ko fẹ lati lọ kuro ni oju.
That is our advice at the moment.	Iyẹn ni imọran wa ni akoko yii.
I am sure he will love it.	Mo da mi loju pe yoo nifẹ rẹ.
I need to clean your house.	Mo ni lati nu ile rẹ.
Little is known about them.	Diẹ ni a mọ nipa wọn.
Road lights have changed.	Awọn ina opopona ti yipada.
We have a head here.	A ni ori nibi.
But they did not tell us everything.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko sọ ohun gbogbo fun wa.
The best way is to find.	Ọna ti o dara julọ ni lati wa.
You will not laugh.	Iwọ kii yoo rẹrin.
Others think the same thing.	Awọn miiran ro ohun kanna.
People find that the big shoes are almost down.	Awọn eniyan rii pe awọn bata nla ti fẹrẹ lọ silẹ.
I am one.	Mo jẹ ọkan.
Sometimes we love it, other times not at all.	Nigba miiran a nifẹ rẹ, awọn igba miiran rara.
A word of information and understanding.	A ọrọ ti alaye ati oye.
Most of the time, you don’t have that available.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba, iwọ ko ni iyẹn wa.
It's time to dump them.	O to akoko lati ku wọn silẹ.
This man did not.	Ọkunrin yii ko ṣe.
I tried this today for the first time.	Mo gbiyanju eyi loni fun igba akọkọ.
And he wanted to.	Ati pe o fẹ.
He does not want drinks or food.	Ko fẹ ohun mimu tabi ounjẹ.
I had to do what they told me to do.	Mo ni lati ṣe ohun ti wọn sọ fun mi lati ṣe.
It was no surprise to me.	Ko ṣe ohun iyanu fun mi.
It’s true for me too.	O jẹ otitọ fun mi paapaa.
I have a very good idea.	Mo ni ero to dara julọ.
But everyone is on your own with them, you know.	Ṣugbọn gbogbo eniyan wa lori tirẹ pẹlu wọn, o mọ.
I don't know why you did this, but it's really good.	Emi ko mọ idi ti o fi ṣe eyi, ṣugbọn o dara gaan.
I of course agree with this.	Mo dajudaju gba pẹlu eyi.
I can't stand it.	Emi ko le duro pẹlu rẹ.
They are transported everywhere.	Wọn ti wa ni ọkọ nibi gbogbo.
Most players have never seen it.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹrọ orin ko tii ri.
He had never been afraid.	O ti ko ti bẹru.
You start to believe in yourself.	O bẹrẹ lati gbagbọ funrararẹ.
This thing is incomprehensible.	Nkan yii ko ni oye.
You don’t want them swimming around.	O ko fẹ wọn we ni ayika.
But that cannot happen.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko le ṣẹlẹ.
But not more than one.	Ṣugbọn ko ju ọkan lọ.
I want to let you know that.	Mo fe lati jẹ ki o mọ pe.
Have to look at them twice to catch everything.	Ni lati wo wọn ni igba meji lati mu ohun gbogbo.
The sister finished her work as we were told, and came back.	Arabinrin naa pari iṣẹ rẹ bi a ti sọ, o si pada wa.
Please advise possible or not.	Jọwọ imọran o ṣee ṣe tabi rara.
But remember to get your books first.	Ṣugbọn ranti lati gba awọn iwe rẹ ni akọkọ.
I have not done that yet.	Emi ko tii ṣe iyẹn sibẹsibẹ.
They love to travel.	Wọn nifẹ lati rin irin-ajo.
It is not new, but it is not even old.	Kii ṣe tuntun, ṣugbọn kii ṣe atijọ paapaa.
Or do something else.	Tabi ṣe ohun miiran.
Most people are in the doctor's office.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan wa ni ọfiisi dokita.

Old friends come to visit.	Awọn ọrẹ atijọ wa lati ṣabẹwo.
My husband loves it.	Ọkọ mi fẹran rẹ.
But most of them are now dead.	Ṣugbọn pupọ julọ ninu wọn ti ku ni bayi.
It seems easy to learn.	O dabi pe o rọrun lati kọ ẹkọ.
However no man was lost that night.	Sibẹsibẹ ko si ọkunrin kan ti o padanu ni alẹ yẹn.
There will be no profit in it anymore.	Ko ni ni ere kankan ninu rẹ mọ.
The problem cuts both ways.	Iṣoro naa ge awọn ọna mejeeji.
It does not matter what others say or think.	Ko ṣe pataki ohun ti awọn miiran sọ tabi ronu.
Good to know you.	O dara lati mọ ọ.
I can not think of any other.	Emi ko le ronu ti eyikeyi miiran.
Not really for kids.	Kii ṣe fun awọn ọmọde gaan.
There is no way they will miss us now.	Ko si ọna ti wọn yoo padanu wa ni bayi.
You can understand whether something is moving or not.	O le ni oye boya nkan kan n gbe tabi rara.
This is from school we must have rules for everything.	Eyi jẹ lati ile-iwe ti a gbọdọ ni awọn ofin fun ohun gbogbo.
They start up.	Wọn bẹrẹ si oke.
I should have seen it already.	Mo ti yẹ ki o ti ri tẹlẹ.
None of this matters.	Ko si eyi ti o ṣe pataki.
Your best application.	Ohun elo rẹ ti o dara julọ.
There is no opportunity to do so.	Ko si anfani lati ṣe bẹ.
And you know where you live, especially.	Ati pe o mọ ibi ti o ngbe, paapaa.
Everyone wants money.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ owo.
The paper made from these fibers is very long.	Iwe ti a ṣe lati awọn okun wọnyi jẹ pipẹ pupọ.
People will die.	Eniyan yoo ku.
I hate something like this.	Mo korira nkan bayi.
I do not agree with this.	Emi ko gba si eyi.
Remember, it will not be theirs.	Ranti, kii yoo jẹ ti wọn.
From your place.	Lati ibi rẹ.
This is early morning.	Eyi jẹ owurọ owurọ.
We break heads, get the job done.	A fọ awọn ori, gba iṣẹ naa.
Talk to you soon.	Ba ọ sọrọ laipẹ.
She was scared.	O bẹru.
There is a train station nearby.	Ibudo ọkọ oju irin wa nitosi ibi.
I don't like them anymore.	Emi ko fẹran wọn mọ.
I drink very hot water.	Mo mu omi gbona pupọ.
My goal is to get to know you better.	Ipinnu mi ni lati mọ ọ daradara.
But that is not the point.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe aaye naa.
I never met him in person, only heard stories.	Emi ko pade rẹ ni eniyan, nikan gbọ awọn itan.
No, that's not all.	Rara, kii ṣe iyẹn nikan.
The periods of our lives are long.	Awọn akoko ti igbesi aye wa jẹ pipẹ.
I would definitely come back to this position.	Emi yoo dajudaju pada wa si ipo yii.
Please tell me if you can get a cat.	Jọwọ sọ fun mi pe o le gba ologbo kan.
Why not decide at all.	Idi ko pinnu rara.
But not that way.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọna yẹn.
You can read about them here.	O le ka nipa wọn nibi.
I'm happy for him.	Inu mi dun fun u.
Someone tried to kill himself.	Eniyan kan gbiyanju lati pa ara rẹ.
Still love it.	Si tun nifẹ rẹ.
There is nothing to doubt about it.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣiyemeji nipa rẹ.
We are enjoying.	A n gbadun.
He is killing her.	O n pa a.
It's not right for me.	Ko tọ si mi gaan.
It's not fun to see me.	O dabi pe ko dun lati ri mi.
And don't touch them either.	Ati ki o ma ṣe kan wọn boya.
Here is what you want.	Eyi ni ohun ti o fẹ.
I wish I couldn’t be more.	Mo fẹ pupọ ti ko le jẹ.
I am in school.	Mo wa ni ile-iwe.
He will see this through.	Oun yoo rii eyi nipasẹ.
This can come in many forms.	Eyi le wa si ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
However, it gave him food to think about.	Sibẹsibẹ, o fun u ni ounjẹ lati ronu.
They have good money.	Won ni ti o dara owo.
You do not understand, do you?	O ko loye, ṣe?
Tell me.	Sọ fun mi.
I just thought that.	Mo kan ro iyẹn.
They will continue to play both very well.	Wọn yoo tẹsiwaju lati mu awọn mejeeji ṣiṣẹ pupọ.
It's too full.	Pupo ti kun.
I love people here.	Mo nifẹ awọn eniyan nibi.
They are a great team.	Wọn jẹ ẹgbẹ nla kan.
It is everywhere in the house.	O wa nibi gbogbo ni ile.
Soon, it will be.	Laipẹ, yoo jẹ.
We write in capital letters.	A kọ ni awọn lẹta nla.
They are giving.	Won n fun won ni.
Sometimes he can’t come back in time for dinner.	Nigba miiran ko le pada ni akoko fun ounjẹ alẹ.
You know something is wrong with me.	O mọ pe ohun kan ko tọ pẹlu mi.
He did not want to call me with this report.	Ko fẹ lati pe mi pẹlu iroyin yii.
I do not know how to deal with it.	Emi ko mọ bi a ṣe le ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
But you don’t need to wait if you don’t want to.	Ṣugbọn o ko nilo lati duro ti o ko ba fẹ.
I do not understand it.	Emi ko loye rẹ.
I stood, looked down, and laughed out loud.	Mo duro, mo n wo isalẹ, mo si rẹrin rara.
It's amazing.	O ṣe iyalẹnu.
No one wants to talk.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹ lati ba sọrọ.
For the first method.	Fun ọna akọkọ.
I could not feel much of my own.	Emi ko le rilara pupọ ti ara mi.
Let's find another way.	Jẹ ki a wa ọna miiran.
But the baby is no longer there.	Ṣugbọn ọmọ naa ko si nibẹ mọ.
You might as well get used to it.	O le bi daradara to lo lati o.
You will know.	Iwọ yoo mọ.
You notice them, you notice.	O ṣe akiyesi wọn, o ṣe akiyesi.
I just want to change this.	Mo kan fẹ lati yi eyi pada.
There was no house last night.	Ko si ile ni alẹ ana.
Much to do.	Pupọ lati ṣe.
It is worth paying more for the shoes.	O tọ lati san diẹ sii fun awọn bata bata.
I have seen them.	Mo ti ri wọn.
They let you sleep.	Wọn jẹ ki o sun.
A value goes down, down, down.	Iye kan lọ si isalẹ, isalẹ, isalẹ.
He loves cats.	O fẹ awọn ologbo.
Now is your time.	Bayi o jẹ akoko tirẹ.
He loves it, of course.	O nifẹ rẹ, dajudaju.
This is a good intellectual tool.	Eyi jẹ ohun elo ọgbọn ti o dara.
That’s all behind me right now.	Iyẹn jẹ gbogbo lẹhin mi ni bayi.
You should not worry.	O yẹ ki o ṣe aniyan.
You do not even know who he is.	O ko paapaa mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
They took everything so you could enjoy your wedding.	Wọn mu ohun gbogbo ki o le gbadun igbeyawo rẹ.
It stays.	O duro jẹ.
There is more bad news about it.	Awọn iroyin buburu diẹ sii wa nipa rẹ.
We have no special place.	A ko ni pataki ni ibi.
That is what it is.	Ohun ti o jẹ niyẹn.
He will accompany us to dinner.	Oun yoo ba wa lọ si ounjẹ alẹ.
In a way, of course.	Ni ọna kan, dajudaju.
Not sure where to look for these.	Ko daju daju ibiti o wa fun awọn wọnyi.
The noonday sun hit us.	Oorun ọsan lu wa.
Of course my life is not perfect.	Dajudaju igbesi aye mi ko pe.
I like the best prices.	Mo fẹran awọn owo ti o dara julọ.
Close the box now.	Pa apoti naa ni bayi.
Let them try to stop me.	Jẹ ká jẹ ki wọn gbiyanju lati da mi.
But he will help many others.	Ṣugbọn oun yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran.
And after a week, one more.	Ati lẹhin ọsẹ kan, ọkan diẹ sii.
They meet a man who is calling a phone.	Wọn pade ọkunrin kan ti o n pe foonu kan.
Just know when to cut yourself off.	Kan mọ igba lati ge ara rẹ kuro.
They have no power.	Wọn ko ni agbara.
Think of the way you go, year in, year out.	Ronu ti ọna ti o lọ, ọdun ni, ọdun jade.
He can't.	Ko le ṣe.
We want everyone to be the best in their classes.	A fẹ ki gbogbo eniyan dara julọ ni awọn kilasi wọn.
If they do not.	Ti wọn ko ṣe.
It's outside.	O wa ni ita ita.
Their children are angry.	Awọn ọmọ wọn binu.
The work is done.	Iṣẹ naa ti ṣe.
Thirty people are reported dead.	Ọgbọn eniyan ni iroyin ti ku.
I will not let you take anything else from him.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki o gba ohunkohun miiran lọwọ rẹ.
Aye sun.	Aye sun.
This could not be such a big deal.	Eyi ko le jẹ adehun nla bẹ.
Someone sent him a contract.	Ẹnikan fi iwe adehun ranṣẹ fun u.
Just there.	O kan wa nibẹ.
So you see with us.	Nitorina o ri pẹlu wa.
I do not know what.	Emi ko mọ kini.
Sometimes they took me out, even.	Nigba miiran wọn mu mi jade, paapaa.
You can not go up.	O ko le lọ soke.
Or you have what it feels like.	Tabi ti o ni ohun ti o ro bi.
The children were sleeping on the roof.	Awọn ọmọ ti sun lori oke.
I need to see it.	Mo nilo lati ri i.
Only understand.	Nikan ni oye.
So we can have our own home.	Nitorina a le ni ile ti ara wa.
I had a hard time with something.	Mo ni akoko lile pẹlu nkan kan.
Two women live in the house.	Obinrin meji gbe ni ile.
I hope they do something about it.	Mo nireti pe wọn ṣe nkan nipa rẹ.
There are also.	Nibẹ ni o tun wa.
Go ahead and give them a go.	Tẹsiwaju ki o fun wọn ni lọ.
The men who killed him.	Awọn ọkunrin ti o pa a.
You can not miss it.	O ko le padanu rẹ.
You really want to have something new to say.	O fẹ gaan lati ni nkan tuntun lati sọ.
The tea is too hot.	Tii naa gbona ju.
That should help you.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o ran ọ lọwọ.
However, maybe better that way.	Sibẹsibẹ, boya dara ni ọna yẹn.
I do not know why we have not talked in two weeks.	Emi ko mọ idi ti a ko ti sọrọ ni ọsẹ meji.
His eyes closed.	Oju re pa.
They tell us to tell our story through their music.	Wọn sọ fun wa lati sọ itan wa nipasẹ orin wọn.
So it was more breakfast.	Nitorina o jẹ ounjẹ owurọ diẹ sii.
Locked the door behind him.	Ti ilẹkun lẹhin rẹ.
We will never know that.	A yoo ko mọ pe.
As hard as they work, families always come first for them.	Ni lile bi wọn ti n ṣiṣẹ, idile nigbagbogbo wa akọkọ fun wọn.
They want more.	Wọn fẹ diẹ sii.
So at least not at all.	Nitorina o kere julọ rara.
She loves it so much, so much.	O nifẹ rẹ pupọ, pupọ.
It felt good, really good.	O ro ti o dara, gan ti o dara.
It can only be one day in life.	O le jẹ ọjọ kan nikan ni igbesi aye.
The lesson became.	Ẹkọ naa di.
Our body receives a lot of energy from us.	Ara wa gba agbara pupọ lati ọdọ wa.
I'll just get out there.	Emi yoo kan gba jade nibẹ.
I don’t think you have much.	Emi ko ro pe o ni Elo.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.	Ko si iru eyi ti o ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
Not much in a bad way.	Kii ṣe pupọ ni ọna buburu.
He has not been the same dog since.	Ko tii jẹ aja kanna lati igba naa.
They find that their thinking is completely wrong.	Wọn rii pe ero wọn jẹ aṣiṣe patapata.
Until this year.	Titi di ọdun yii.
Until the next morning.	Titi di owurọ owurọ.
But this is.	Sugbon eleyi ni.
It’s a great way to understand where they are.	O jẹ ọna ti o dara julọ lati loye ibi ti wọn wa.
Sun and sun.	Oorun ati oorun.
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti mo n ṣe ti ko tọ.
That's right and that's right.	Iyẹn tọ ati pe iyẹn tọ.
Everyone is scared.	Gbogbo eniyan bẹru.
The rooms are really clean.	Awọn yara jẹ gan mọ.
She fears her daughter will be harmed.	O bẹru pe ọmọbirin rẹ yoo ṣe ipalara.
Do not invite him to your party.	Maṣe pe e si ibi ayẹyẹ rẹ.
Men will not be allowed to have it tonight.	A ko ni jẹ ki awọn ọkunrin ni i ni alẹ oni.
The word comes again.	Ọrọ naa wa lẹẹkansi.
It's very difficult.	O nira pupọ.
To go into the room with him.	Lati lọ sinu yara pẹlu rẹ.
It does not mean that they did not do what they were supposed to do.	Ko tumọ si pe wọn ko ṣe ohun ti wọn yẹ lati ṣe.
All is not well with this company.	Gbogbo ko dara pẹlu ile-iṣẹ yii.
Look at everything in the past.	Wo ohun gbogbo ti a ti kọja.
But his father was right.	Ṣugbọn baba rẹ ni otitọ.
Sometimes special.	Nigba miiran pataki.
And so, by the way.	Ati bẹ naa, nipasẹ ọna.
He knew they had to stop them.	O mọ pe wọn ni lati da wọn duro.
I remember the day it happened.	Mo ranti ọjọ ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It’s enough to live, say, and enjoy your work.	O to lati gbe, o sọ, ati gbadun iṣẹ rẹ.
At least let me give you a tour.	Jọwọ, o kere ju jẹ ki n fun ọ ni irin-ajo kan.
This is a big problem in many companies.	Eyi jẹ iṣoro nla ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ile-iṣẹ.
This year, they tried another meal.	Ni ọdun yii, wọn tun gbiyanju ounjẹ miiran.
Your brother.	Arakunrin re.
It seems to have worked.	O dabi pe o ti ṣiṣẹ.
Some may, but not all.	Diẹ ninu awọn le, sugbon ko gbogbo.
We want to touch it, we want to touch it.	A fẹ lati fi ọwọ kan, a fẹ lati fi ọwọ kan rẹ.
This is happening today.	Eyi ti n ṣẹlẹ loni.
Who taught you how to cook?	Tani o kọ ọ bi o ṣe le ṣe ounjẹ?
I think that's great.	Mo ro pe iyẹn dara julọ.
I don’t like it in myself.	Emi ko fẹran rẹ ninu ara mi.
This program is not very good, however.	Eto yii ko dara julọ, sibẹsibẹ.
I don’t wish you could have.	Emi ko fẹ o le ni.
Privilege.	Anfani.
It should have been here a few hours ago.	O yẹ ki o wa nibi ni awọn wakati diẹ sẹhin.
You think so out of it.	Ti o ro bẹ jade ti o.
Try to let them come to them.	Gbiyanju lati jẹ ki wọn wa si wọn.
He did not sit in it.	Ko joko ninu rẹ.
My brother and his family live there.	Arakunrin mi ati ebi re n gbe nibẹ.
We all have to take care of our lives	Gbogbo wa ni lati tọju aye wa
It doesn’t make a face.	Ko ni ṣe oju kan.
In all cases, there is a problem.	Ni gbogbo igba, iṣoro kan wa.
Learn your rules and keep them.	Kọ ẹkọ awọn ofin rẹ ki o si pa wọn mọ.
By themselves, they sound good.	Nipa ara wọn, wọn dun ti o dara.
You have to teach me.	O ni lati kọ mi.
Not for years if ever.	Ko fun ọdun ti o ba ti lailai.
They can talk, and you don't have to listen to them.	Wọn le sọrọ, ati pe ko ni lati gbọ wọn.
Just had a test.	O kan ni idanwo kan.
It’s not my best job to say the least.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ mi ti o dara julọ lati sọ o kere ju.
He is coming with us.	O n bọ pẹlu wa.
Early to say, he would like to see another.	Ni kutukutu lati sọ, yoo fẹ lati wo miiran.
The meeting was over for two hours from then on, and he could not sleep.	Ipade naa ti pari fun wakati meji lati igba naa, ko si le sun.
He doesn't like the boys' company.	Ko fẹran ile-iṣẹ awọn ọmọkunrin.
I'm late for work.	Mo ti pẹ fun iṣẹ.
He is working on his ideas.	O n ṣiṣẹ lori awọn imọran rẹ.
You should write about this for the school textbook, you know.	O yẹ ki o kọ nipa eyi fun iwe ile-iwe, o mọ.
It’s time to move on.	O to akoko lati gbe ipo kan.
I got up and turned around.	Mo dide mo si yipada.
I'll take it.	Emi yoo mu u.
I will tell you the truth.	Emi yoo sọ otitọ fun ọ.
It was not a beautiful sight.	O je ko kan lẹwa oju.
It takes some time before you know what it is.	O gba akoko diẹ ṣaaju ki o to mọ kini o jẹ.
I missed it all.	Mo padanu gbogbo rẹ.
I'll wait.	Ma duro.
It's not.	Kii ṣe.
We have known for a while.	A ti mọ fun igba diẹ.
I have to go now.	Mo gbọdọ lọ ni bayi.
Maybe you can do better.	Boya o le ṣe dara julọ.
Good as your last work.	O dara bi iṣẹ ti o kẹhin rẹ.
I am with them.	Mo wa pẹlu wọn.
So it can’t be too much.	Nitorina ko le jẹ pupọ.
I'll drink and sleep.	Emi yoo mu ati sun.
We miss you so much.	A padanu rẹ pupọ.
Every word is true.	Gbogbo ọrọ jẹ otitọ.
He just could not see his father's face.	O kan ko le ri oju baba rẹ.
Do not blow your own plane with a ball.	Maṣe fọ ọkọ ofurufu ti ara rẹ pẹlu bọọlu.
There is also time for you to leave.	Akoko tun wa fun ọ lati lọ kuro.
Enjoy this opportunity.	Gbadun anfani yii.
It makes a point of that.	O ṣe aaye kan ti iyẹn.
But more than that, his story caught up with him.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ, itan rẹ mu u.
You know what time it is for the kids.	O mọ bi akoko ṣe jẹ fun awọn ọmọde.
He looked away.	O wo kuro.
What do you think about this ?.	Kini ero rẹ nipa eyi?.
Some of these people can't even speak!	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan wọnyi ko le sọrọ paapaa!
I hate that thing.	Mo korira ohun ti o.
The men sat on his back and grabbed his legs.	Awọn ọkunrin joko lori ẹhin rẹ o si di ẹsẹ rẹ mu.
I will leave you to him.	Emi yoo fi ọ silẹ fun u.
Are there books yet?	Njẹ awọn iwe ti wa sibẹsibẹ?
This beautiful woman is what you want in your life.	Obinrin lẹwa yii jẹ ohun ti o fẹ ninu igbesi aye rẹ.
He took a big mouth in it.	O mu ẹnu nla kan ninu rẹ.
And we did not miss them.	Ati pe a ko padanu wọn.
It has nothing to do with such people.	Ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu iru awọn eniyan bẹẹ.
This past summer, they found one.	Igba ooru ti o kọja yii, wọn rii ọkan kan.
The law can not touch me if you want.	Ofin ko le fi ọwọ kan mi ti o ba fẹ.
Don't ask me why.	Maṣe beere lọwọ mi idi.
Do not be afraid.	Maṣe bẹru.
For their whole family.	Fun gbogbo idile wọn.
Get out of your way.	Jade kuro ni ọna tirẹ.
Visually, out of one	Ti oju, kuro ninu ọkan
We will still find ourselves even if we do not work together.	A yoo tun rii ara wa paapaa ti a ko ba ṣiṣẹ papọ.
You have to leave it to someone.	O ni lati fi silẹ fun ẹnikan.
I do not have much money available.	Emi ko ni owo pupọ to wa.
Maybe more so.	Boya diẹ sii bẹ.
He always expected the cats to try to eat him.	Nigbagbogbo o nireti pe awọn ologbo gbiyanju lati jẹ oun.
I will stay with you until you leave.	Emi yoo duro pẹlu rẹ titi iwọ o fi lọ.
I get errors.	Mo gba awọn aṣiṣe.
In my opinion, history is facts.	Ni ero mi, itan jẹ awọn otitọ.
I do not even have a name.	Emi ko paapaa ni orukọ.
You will not find it here!	Iwọ kii yoo rii nibi!
That was his whole life.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ.
All eyes on the dog.	Gbogbo oju si aja.
At first hearing, it is not possible.	Ni akọkọ gbọ, ko ṣee ṣe.
It got us early, you know.	O ni wa ni kutukutu, o mọ.
I walked around the house.	Mo rin ni ayika ile naa.
He is leaving next week.	O n lọ kuro ni ọsẹ to nbọ.
For a while, nothing happened.	Fun igba diẹ, ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
They can also cross the road like yours.	Wọn le tun kọja ni opopona bi tirẹ.
Nothing can stop it.	Ko si ohun ti o le da a duro.
She has two sons.	O ni ọmọkunrin meji.
He closed his eyes.	O pa oju re.
We do not need to repeat here.	A ko nilo lati tun ṣe nibi.
Maybe next time!.	Boya nigba miiran!.
What a great story to read.	Kini itan nla lati ka.
In other words, you can.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, o le.
You can get up now.	O le dide ni bayi.
You go for work.	O lọ fun iṣẹ.
I tried for many years to make her happy.	Mo gbiyanju fun ọdun pupọ lati mu inu rẹ dun.
Never seen this before.	Ko ri eyi tẹlẹ.
But if you look for it, it will come back soon.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba n wa a, yoo yara pada wa.
You can get.	O le gba.
I have no idea where you can find it.	Emi ko ni imọran ibiti o le wa.
This way you can make sure that nothing is lost.	Ni ọna yii o le rii daju pe ko si ohun ti o padanu.
Read the first chapter of this book.	Ka ori akọkọ ti iwe yii.
Just the same.	O kan kanna.
It could be a lot more.	O le jẹ pupọ diẹ sii.
I want to not do that.	Mo fẹ lati ma ṣe bẹ.
He does not have to do that already.	Oun ko ni lati ṣe iyẹn tẹlẹ.
He closed his eyes.	O pa oju rẹ mọ.
We know who killed them.	A mọ ẹniti o pa wọn.
Just the door.	O kan ilẹkun.
Move them around.	Gbe wọn ni ayika.
The table was changed so that it could not be moved up.	A yi tabili pada ki o le ko soke.
I have been looking for you since the last minute.	Mo ti n wa ọ lati iṣẹju ti o lọ.
It is not in me to say anything to you.	Ko si ninu mi lati sọ rara si ọ.
The old city is completely rebuilt.	Ilu atijọ ti tun ṣe patapata.
We are small.	A jẹ kekere.
It's a simple one.	O rọrun kan.
One only needs to look at the news to see.	Ọkan nilo nikan wo awọn iroyin lati rii.
But we either agree on some things or not and move on.	Sugbon a boya gba lori diẹ ninu awọn ohun tabi ko ati ki o tẹsiwaju.
You know that face very well.	O mọ oju yẹn daradara daradara.
We do not know why.	A ko mọ idi.
I don't like it here, you know.	Emi ko fẹran rẹ nibi, o mọ.
His education did not end there.	Ẹkọ rẹ ko pari nibẹ.
We did it all this morning.	A ṣe gbogbo rẹ ni owurọ yii.
This may have changed since then which should not come as a surprise to me.	Eyi le ti yipada lati igba naa eyi ti kii yoo ṣe ohun iyanu fun mi.
It is not a question, it is beyond question.	Kii ṣe ibeere, o kọja ibeere.
It will never run again.	O ko ni sare lẹẹkansi.
This is before doing that.	Eyi jẹ ṣaaju ṣiṣe iyẹn.
I will say a little more on this site.	Emi yoo sọ diẹ diẹ sii lori aaye yii.
Appointments that must be kept.	Awọn ipinnu lati pade ti o gbọdọ pa.
I do not know much about it.	Emi ko mọ pupọ nipa rẹ.
Of course something must have happened to change the clock.	Dajudaju ohun kan gbọdọ ti ṣẹlẹ lati yi wakati pada.
Whether you were aware of it or not.	Boya o wà mọ ti o tabi ko.
Another man was there with his wife.	Ọkunrin miiran wa nibẹ pẹlu iyawo rẹ.
If no one wants it, no one will take it out.	Ti ko ba si ẹnikan ti o fẹ, ko si ọkan ti yoo gbe e jade.
That is not for me to decide.	Iyẹn kii ṣe fun mi lati pinnu.
We have no idea who he is.	A ko ni imọran ẹniti o jẹ.
I know why he came here.	Mo mọ idi ti o fi wa si ibi.
I rely on you.	Mo fi ara le e.
If not, forget it.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, gbagbe rẹ.
Ask someone who will know.	Beere ẹnikan ti yoo mọ.
I talk to my classes.	Mo sọrọ si awọn kilasi mi.
Whatever you want is what you will do.	Ohunkohun ti o fẹ ni ohun ti o yoo ṣe.
Help yourself to whatever is in it.	Ran ara rẹ lọwọ si ohunkohun ti o wa ninu .
It is small here.	O jẹ kekere nibi.
I want to forget.	Mo fe gbagbe.
I can tell you completely, it does not.	Mo le sọ fun ọ patapata, ko ṣe bẹ.
It is important, because people live with these things.	O ṣe pataki, nitori awọn eniyan n gbe pẹlu nkan wọnyi.
You have seen yourself like that before.	O ti rii ararẹ bii iyẹn tẹlẹ.
None of us will.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa yoo.
Start again, he said.	Bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi, o sọ.
And they say it is wrong.	Ati pe wọn sọ ọ ni aṣiṣe.
I loved it, of course.	Mo ti fẹ rẹ, dajudaju.
Something about it is wrong.	Nkankan nipa rẹ jẹ aṣiṣe.
Into a bag.	Sinu apo kan.
I know you know.	Mo mọ pe o mọ.
Do not enter the house!	Maṣe wọ inu ile naa!
Probably a mistake.	O ṣee ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
They play more physical games.	Wọn ṣe ere ti ara diẹ sii.
It was right for him to pick that up.	O tọ fun u lati gbe iyẹn soke.
Or, at least, one of his eyes turned to us.	Tabi, o kere ju, ọkan ninu awọn oju rẹ yipada si wa.
You don’t want to be like her.	O ko fẹ lati dabi rẹ.
It doesn’t bother me right now, but it’s over.	Ko ṣe aniyan mi ni bayi, ṣugbọn o ti kọja.
He will stay there.	Oun yoo duro nibẹ.
He reached up and pulled her towards him.	O de oke o si fa u si ọdọ rẹ.
Sure you have spent a lot of time on this.	O daju pe o ti lo akoko pupọ lori eyi.
You have to, first, decide who they are.	O ni lati, ni akọkọ, pinnu tani wọn jẹ.
But I did.	Sugbon mo ṣe.
Get to know this person better.	Gba lati mọ eniyan yii dara diẹ sii.
There is plenty of room for imagination to run around.	Ọpọlọpọ yara fun oju inu lati ṣiṣe ni ayika ni.
It shook my head.	O mi ori.
Age will do so.	Ọjọ ori yoo ṣe bẹ.
It was a very life.	O je kan gidigidi aye.
We must keep.	A gbọdọ tọju.
Bought shops from the store.	Ti ra awọn ile itaja lati ile itaja.
I remember thinking, this may be our last day ever.	Mo ranti ero, eyi le jẹ ọjọ ikẹhin wa lailai.
And that was last week.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ ọsẹ to kọja.
One mistake, one small.	Aṣiṣe kan, kekere kan.
They are family now.	Wọn jẹ idile ni bayi.
But it is good.	Sugbon o da.
We cannot leave.	A ko le lọ kuro.
You don’t want to see it like this.	O ko fẹ ki o ri i bi eleyi.
Are you sure you want to view this?	Ṣe o da ọ loju pe o fẹ wo eyi?
The first name is good with us.	Orukọ akọkọ dara pẹlu wa.
This way of life is no more.	Ọna igbesi aye yii ko si mọ.
Even more so with kids.	Paapaa diẹ sii pẹlu awọn ọmọde.
It's too much for me.	O ju mi ​​gan.
But the most important thing.	Ṣugbọn ohun ti o ṣe pataki julọ.
I know, very easy again.	Mo mọ, rọrun pupọ lẹẹkansi.
Good for them.	O dara fun wọn.
Their company is very small.	Ile-iṣẹ wọn kere pupọ.
He was not happy to see me.	Inu re ko dun lati ri mi.
It does not have to be done manually.	O ko ni lati ṣe pẹlu ọwọ.
And find yourself doing what you want to do.	Ki o si ri ara rẹ lọwọ ṣiṣe ohun ti o fẹ lati ṣe.
They are better than that.	Wọn dara ju iyẹn lọ.
He touched her hand.	O fi ọwọ kan ọwọ rẹ.
Please, say.	Jọwọ, sọ.
If you only make one point your stuff.	Ti o ba ṣe aaye kan nikan awọn nkan rẹ.
I didn’t ask for it or anything.	Emi ko beere rẹ tabi ohunkohun.
It is almost done.	O ti fẹrẹ ṣe.
This is not about them.	Eyi kii ṣe nipa wọn.
Water drawn from a river.	Omi ti a fa jade ninu odo.
Think about it, you just don’t understand any.	Ronu nipa rẹ, o kan ko ni oye eyikeyi.
Start in the right way.	Bẹrẹ ni ọna ti o tọ.
It will come through.	O yoo wa nipasẹ.
But it is not the only one.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọkan nikan.
I could not see you at first.	Emi ko ti le ri ọ ni akọkọ.
She decided to learn to cook from her mother,	O pinnu lati kọ ẹkọ lati ṣe ounjẹ lati ọdọ iya rẹ,
Words came out of my mouth.	Awọn ọrọ ti ẹnu mi jade.
Nothing special about them.	Ko si ohun pataki nipa wọn.
At least, that’s what they’ll tell you.	O kere ju, iyẹn ni ohun ti wọn yoo sọ fun ọ.
He saw the sun rise.	O ri oorun dide.
At least, it seems to be.	O kere ju, o dabi pe o jẹ.
But he touched it and went away for a while.	Ṣugbọn o fi ọwọ kan ki o lọ fun igba diẹ.
She surprised him with her story.	O ṣe iyanu fun u pẹlu itan rẹ.
But we did not find him.	Ṣugbọn a ko ri i.
We know nothing about where he came from.	A ko mọ nkankan nipa ibi ti o ti wa.
That's because there weren't many.	Ti o ni nitori nibẹ wà ko ọpọlọpọ.
She had felt it outside, sitting in the garden, and everywhere inside.	O ti rilara rẹ ni ita, o joko ninu ọgba, ati nibi gbogbo inu.
I do not have a car.	Emi ko ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
It was his first song.	O jẹ orin akọkọ rẹ.
I would be surprised if that is the case.	Yoo jẹ iyalẹnu ti iyẹn ba jẹ bẹẹ.
But his eyes fixed on her.	Ṣugbọn oju rẹ duro fun u.
It was only a short break.	O jẹ isinmi igba diẹ nikan.
I do not do that like this.	Emi ko ṣe iyẹn bii ọrọ yii.
There are some pictures that one person expects to see.	Awọn aworan kan wa ti eniyan kan nireti lati rii.
You have never been in love.	O ko ti ni ife.
My name is not disclosed.	Orukọ mi ko ti sọ.
Even taking children with them.	Paapaa mu awọn ọmọde pẹlu wọn.
He’s just a bad guy.	O kan ni eniyan buburu.
He is dead and the best.	O ti ku ati ohun ti o dara ju.
It didn’t seem to matter much anymore.	O dabi enipe ko ṣe pataki pupọ mọ.
Do not make other plans.	Maṣe ṣe awọn eto miiran.
But he was tired.	Sugbon o ti re re.
But this song, for me, is my life.	Ṣugbọn orin yii, fun mi, igbesi aye mi ni.
He really slept on this.	O sun gan lori eyi.
It has been years.	O ti jẹ ọdun.
I read them out.	Mo ti ka wọn jade.
He rented a car.	O ya ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
But nothing special.	Sugbon ti ohunkohun ko pataki.
Clean up was not fun.	Nu soke je ko fun.
At that time, another car was spotted.	Ni akoko yẹn, ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ miiran ti rii.
My father is out.	Baba mi jade.
It was the first of the month.	O jẹ akọkọ ti oṣu.
I have heard about this young policeman who is unlike any other.	Mo ti gbọ nipa ọdọ ọlọpa ọdọ yii ti ko dabi awọn miiran.
Such is not the case.	Iru kii ṣe.
And they need you to visit soon.	Ati pe wọn nilo ki o ṣabẹwo si laipẹ.
We know a little about it.	A mọ diẹ nipa rẹ.
We want to write something.	A fẹ lati kọ nkan.
I really like it.	Mo nifẹ rẹ gaan.
Many of them.	Pupọ ninu wọn.
I really like the room.	A feran yara naa gaan.
They are already dying.	Wọn ti n ku tẹlẹ.
I will let it happen at the right time.	Emi yoo jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ ni akoko to tọ.
No one at the party seemed to know anything.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa ni awọn ayẹyẹ dabi ẹni pe o ti mọ ohunkohun.
Make sure you are aware of possible injuries.	Rii daju pe o mọ awọn ipalara ti o ṣeeṣe.
When we are tired, we sleep.	Nigba ti a ba re, a sun.
I'm late.	Mo wa pẹ.
I am long enough.	Mo fi gun to.
I lost my mother more than ever.	Mo padanu iya mi ju lailai.
I want to do.	Mo fe lati se.
I'm so glad I did not know my biological father.	Inu mi dun pupọ nipa mi ko mọ baba ibi mi.
Both talk about it.	Awọn mejeeji sọrọ nipa rẹ.
The new law raises a lot of eyebrows.	Ofin tuntun gbe ọpọlọpọ awọn oju oju soke.
There is no game you can.	Ko si ere ti o le.
She hopes her child will do well in school.	O nireti pe ọmọ rẹ yoo ṣe daradara ni ile-iwe.
Of course, the outfit is also good.	Dajudaju, aṣọ naa tun dara.
You see your child in everything and everywhere.	O ri ọmọ rẹ ni ohun gbogbo ati nibi gbogbo.
This is my office.	Eyi ni ọfiisi mi.
But it doesn’t matter how much the sun misses it.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe pataki bi oorun ti padanu rẹ.
My mother lives here.	Iya mi ngbe nibi.
He rejected all appointments.	O kọ gbogbo awọn ipinnu lati pade rẹ silẹ.
Stress is one of them.	Wahala jẹ ọkan ninu wọn.
Talk to them.	Ba wọn sọrọ.
A lot of fun.	A pupo ti fun.
Less for more.	Kere fun diẹ sii.
I’m still getting over it.	Mo tun n gba lori rẹ.
He is my friend.	O jẹ ọrẹ mi.
The city was hit by a massive fire a few years ago.	Ilu naa ni ina nla ni ọdun diẹ sẹhin.
It seems more like the hours.	O dabi diẹ sii bi awọn wakati.
Obviously we are looking for such a game.	O han ni a n wa iru awọn ere kan.
However, only a few people take advantage of it.	Sibẹsibẹ, nikan diẹ eniyan lo anfani ti o.
Let your family spend some time with you.	Jẹ ki idile rẹ lo diẹ ninu awọn akoko pẹlu rẹ.
Repeat with bottom.	Tun pẹlu isalẹ.
That's not good.	Iyẹn ko dara.
We agree with this conclusion.	A gba pẹlu ipari yii.
Remove the heads if desired.	Yọ awọn ori kuro ti o ba fẹ.
I love the water.	Mo nifẹ omi naa.
Do just that.	Ṣe o kan.
Good to walk again.	O dara lati rin lẹẹkansi.
Or maybe you do, and that's why you recommend it.	Tabi boya o ṣe, ati awọn ti o ni idi ti o so o.
The weather is beautiful and warm.	Oju ojo jẹ lẹwa ati ki o gbona.
The family spent a lot of time outside.	Idile naa lo akoko nla ni ita.
They can be even better.	Wọn le paapaa dara julọ.
What you get paid for.	Ohun ti o gba owo fun.
I have that opportunity.	Mo ni anfani yẹn.
Men like him do not.	Awọn ọkunrin bii rẹ ko ṣe.
Not much fire but enough.	Ko Elo ina sugbon to.
We were not told they were accepted.	A ko sọ fun wọn pe a gba wọn fun wọn.
My children will be informed about that.	Awọn ọmọ mi yoo jẹ alaye nipa iyẹn.
This should only take a day or two.	Eyi yẹ ki o gba to ọjọ kan tabi meji nikan.
At least not that you know.	O kere kii ṣe pe o mọ.
This place is young.	Aaye yii jẹ ọdọ.
Nothing to see.	Ko si nkankan lati ri.
Now you must eat.	Bayi o gbọdọ jẹun.
I mean, they're really tired.	Mo tumọ si, wọn ti rẹ wọn gaan.
I don’t remember it ever so high.	Emi ko ranti rẹ lailai ga bẹ.
I want you to meet them.	Mo fẹ ki o pade wọn.
It is still them.	O jẹ ṣi wọn.
I think we had a good morning.	Mo ro pe a ni owurọ ti o dara.
You can say anything.	O le sọ ohunkohun.
Questions are asked.	Awọn ibeere ti wa ni beere.
You can tell people to do something about it, help me.	O le sọ fun eniyan pe ki a ṣe nkan nipa eyi, ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi.
Love it completely.	Nifẹ rẹ patapata.
Your eyes are hard and special.	Oju rẹ jẹ lile ati pataki.
He did not enjoy it.	Ko gbadun re.
Just time to love each other.	O kan akoko lati nifẹ si ara wọn.
We are not there yet.	A ko wa nibẹ sibẹsibẹ.
My dog ​​is very important to me.	Aja mi se pataki fun mi.
I love every minute of their program.	Mo nifẹ gbogbo iṣẹju ti eto wọn.
No one has to insist that they help.	Ko si ẹniti o ni lati ta ku pe wọn ṣe iranlọwọ.
That is very important to me.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki pupọ fun mi.
To both.	Si awon mejeeji.
In some cases, the house may go along.	Ni awọn igba miiran, ile naa le lọ pẹlu.
But he was alive, his eyes beautiful.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ laaye, oju rẹ ti o lẹwa.
Someone is behind it.	Ẹnikan wa lẹhin rẹ.
Please release me!	Jọwọ da mi silẹ!
Citizens celebrate summer.	Awọn ara ilu ṣe ayẹyẹ igba ooru.
And if that takes more than that.	Ati pe ti iyẹn ba gba diẹ sii ju.
There seems to be no such thing in their history.	O dabi pe ko si iru eyi ninu itan wọn.
That may not really help.	Iyẹn ko le ṣe iranlọwọ gaan.
It has been a lot.	O ti jẹ pupọ.
The sister was very nice to him.	Arabinrin naa dara julọ fun u.
Last night, we ate with our local friends.	Ni alẹ ana, a jẹun pẹlu awọn ọrẹ agbegbe wa.
What’s the big deal? 	Kini nkan nla?
I worry about it now.	Mo ṣe aniyan nipa rẹ ni bayi.
This does not make sense to me.	Eyi ko ni oye fun mi.
The world has changed forever.	Aye yi pada lailai.
Neither one of them.	Bẹni ọkan ninu wọn.
It was early in the year.	O je ni kutukutu odun.
You meet people every day so no worries.	O pade eniyan ni gbogbo ọjọ nitorina ko si wahala.
He did not say a word.	Ko sọ ọrọ kan.
I have no idea who or where I went.	Emi ko ni imọran ẹniti tabi ibiti mo ti lọ.
Students continue to write their songs.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe tẹsiwaju lati kọ orin wọn.
No one met her face.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o pade oju rẹ.
In other words, we just lose ourselves.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, a kan padanu ara wa.
They work, they talk about work.	Wọn ṣiṣẹ, wọn sọrọ nipa iṣẹ.
I know you understand.	Mo mọ pe o loye.
I saw the trees down there.	Mo ti ri awọn igi isalẹ nibẹ.
And a great advantage.	Ati anfani nla.
And it is amazing.	Ati pe o jẹ iyalẹnu.
Like so many great ideas, simplicity is important.	Bii ọpọlọpọ awọn imọran nla, o rọrun ni pataki.
I buy whatever you want.	Mo ra ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
His eyes began to close.	Oju rẹ bẹrẹ lati pa.
It's done for.	O ti ṣe fun.
So, it is.	Nitorina, o jẹ.
Whatever they do, they do together.	Ohunkohun ti wọn ṣe, wọn ṣe papọ.
You will be amazed.	O yoo jẹ iyalẹnu.
My wife is trying to get to work.	Iyawo mi n gbiyanju lati gba lati ṣiṣẹ.
You can even see something about it in the book.	O le paapaa wo nkan nipa rẹ ninu iwe naa.
Nothing in it.	Ko si ohun ti o wa ninu.
That’s something to learn from.	Iyẹn jẹ nkan lati kọ ẹkọ lati.
My other books are the same way.	Awọn iwe mi miiran jẹ ọna kanna.
The food is excellent.	Ounjẹ jẹ ohun ti o dara julọ.
But this story misses some important details.	Ṣugbọn itan yii padanu diẹ ninu awọn alaye pataki.
Just hear me out.	O kan gbọ mi jade.
He didn’t even try to keep it.	O ko paapaa gbiyanju lati tọju rẹ.
Drink a drink.	Mu ohun mimu.
For my meeting here.	Fun ipade mi nibi.
I say a lot and not a lot.	Mo sọ ọpọlọpọ ati kii ṣe pupọ julọ.
This will be difficult.	Kii yoo nira.
He could not get out of the way.	Ko le lọ kuro ni ọna.
I think they should be taught.	Mo ro pe o yẹ ki a kọ wọn.
Give me a piece of paper.	Fun mi ni nkan ti iwe.
Essentially, they only take a minute.	Ni pataki, wọn gba iṣẹju kan nikan.
That we made a kind of shoe.	Wipe a ṣe iru kan ti bata.
You must continue.	O gbọdọ tẹsiwaju.
We didn’t think anything about it at the time.	A ko ronu nkankan nipa rẹ ni akoko yẹn.
All of you should just shut up and enjoy my talk.	Gbogbo yin yẹ ki o kan pa ẹnu mọ ki o gbadun ọrọ mi.
That says a lot about it, about them.	Iyẹn sọ pupọ nipa rẹ, nipa wọn.
Can't wait to see it's over.	Ko le duro lati rii pe o ti pari.
I lost my sister so much she had no idea.	Mo padanu arabinrin mi pupọ o ko ni imọran.
We have always allowed ourselves to be forgotten.	Nigbagbogbo a ti gba ara wa laaye lati gbagbe.
People with ideas.	Awọn eniyan pẹlu ero.
But I want to take another path.	Ṣugbọn Mo fẹ gba ọna miiran.
In most cases.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
In fact, this is not true.	Ni otitọ, eyi kii ṣe otitọ.
We will rent our books.	A yoo ya awọn iwe wa.
He refused to open it.	O kọ lati ṣi i.
He learned well.	O kọ ẹkọ daradara.
Do you want something to read?	Ṣe o fẹ nkankan lati ka?
This is also one of my favorite making songs.	Eyi tun jẹ ọkan ninu awọn orin ṣiṣe ayanfẹ mi.
He can't.	Ko le ṣe.
Maybe not all of it.	Boya kii ṣe gbogbo rẹ.
This is very clear.	Eleyi jẹ gidigidi ko o.
No one thought they were great.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ro pe wọn jẹ nla.
I work well with young people.	Mo ṣiṣẹ daradara pẹlu awọn ọdọ.
I have never asked about it.	Emi ko ti beere nipa rẹ.
The top must take up the remaining space.	Oke gbọdọ gba aaye to ku.
Everyone says so.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o sọ bẹẹ.
While he was standing, he wrote letters.	Nigba ti o duro, o kọ awọn lẹta.
He called his brother to find that name.	O pe arakunrin rẹ lati wa orukọ yẹn.
At the very least, it’s worth it.	Ni imọran o kere ju, o tọ.
Please think, no one has ever lived your life before.	Jọwọ ronu, ko si ẹnikan ti o ti gbe igbesi aye rẹ tẹlẹ.
I don’t have much time to photograph.	Emi ko ni akoko pupọ lati ṣe aworan.
You can't talk.	O ko le sọrọ.
That will get you right.	Iyẹn yoo mu ọ tọ si.
She is worried, right now, about what she might have started.	O ni aniyan, ni bayi, nipa kini o le ti bẹrẹ.
When they are dead, move on.	Nigbati wọn ba ti ku, tẹsiwaju.
Even leave my car there too.	Paapaa fi ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi silẹ nibẹ pẹlu.
He did not ask himself any questions.	Ko bi ara re ni ibeere kankan.
You will be right.	Iwọ yoo jẹ otitọ.
I never saw your face.	Emi ko ri oju rẹ rara.
Or they die on the way.	Tabi wọn ku loju ọna.
And a good one, even.	Ati ọkan ti o dara, paapaa.
However, it is not locked.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko tii pa.
Not this way.	Kii ṣe ọna yii.
To me they look the same.	Fun mi wọn dabi kanna.
I am an intelligent person.	Eniyan ti o ni oye ni mi.
Add yourself.	Fi ara rẹ kun.
About everyone and everything.	Nipa gbogbo eniyan ati ohun gbogbo.
I am on the edge.	Mo wa ni eti.
Please contact me if you would like to help.	Jọwọ kan si mi ti o ba fẹ lati ran.
It is very amazing.	O jẹ iyanu pupọ.
It works well.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara.
It works.	O ṣiṣẹ.
I want to be someone.	Mo fẹ lati jẹ ẹnikan.
No one seems to believe or see what you are seeing.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o dabi ẹni pe o gbagbọ tabi wo ohun ti o n rii.
Image.	Aworan.
And if not.	Ati pe ti ko ba ṣe bẹ.
We have to stay behind so we can come together.	A ni lati wa lẹhin ẹhin ki a wa papọ.
I hit three people a few months ago.	Mo ti le eniyan mẹta ni awọn oṣu diẹ sẹhin.
Very good, he said.	O dara pupọ, o sọ.
He wanted to get back on the bed.	O fe lati gba pada lori ibusun.
Not too high.	Ko ga pupọ.
He could not live with it when his work was finished.	Ko le gbe pẹlu rẹ nigbati iṣẹ rẹ pari.
Know your tone.	Mọ ohun orin rẹ.
Both will be fine, the doctor promises	Awọn mejeeji yoo dara, dokita ṣe ileri
Much has changed but enough, it seems, has remained the same.	Pupọ ti yipada ṣugbọn to, o dabi ẹni pe, ti wa kanna.
He did not leave here as he was.	O ko kuro nibi bi o ti jẹ.
At least for now.	O kere ju fun bayi.
But maybe, he said, it’s time to change that.	Ṣugbọn boya, o sọ pe, o to akoko lati yi iyẹn pada.
See what we have done here.	Wo ohun ti a ti ṣe nibi.
You have to look away.	O ni lati wo kuro.
He asked if he could sit down.	O beere boya o le joko.
No problems here.	Ko si awọn iṣoro nibi.
He gives everything.	O fun ni ohun gbogbo.

But no one will know that.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti yoo mọ iyẹn.

Not so much anymore.	Ko ki Elo mọ.
People must tell.	Awọn eniyan gbọdọ sọ fun.

But he thinks our lives could be better without children, too.	Ṣugbọn o ro pe igbesi aye wa le dara laisi awọn ọmọde, paapaa.
It takes about an hour.	O gba to bii wakati kan.
Others look at his clothes.	Awọn miiran wo aṣọ rẹ.

They just need to give them something to do.	Wọn kan nilo lati fun wọn ni nkankan lati ṣe.
Two other ideas continue to the beach.	Awọn ero meji miiran tẹsiwaju si eti okun.

You missed something.	O padanu nkankan.
His hand was in her hair.	Ọwọ rẹ wà ninu irun rẹ.
You don't understand it, you can't understand it.	O ko loye rẹ, ko le loye rẹ.
I can’t ask for anything better.	Emi ko le beere fun ohunkohun ti o dara julọ.
This power is important because without it, nothing will come of it.	Agbara yii jẹ pataki nitori laisi rẹ, ko si ohun ti yoo wa.
We will learn how to do it.	A yoo kọ bi a ṣe le ṣe.
It made me good money.	O ṣe mi ni owo to dara.
That is always obvious.	Iyẹn nigbagbogbo han gbangba.
I understand very little of it, but it seems strange.	Mo loye pupọ diẹ ninu rẹ, ṣugbọn o dabi iyalẹnu.
But he could not do so.	Ṣugbọn ko le ṣe bẹ.
Or anything else with a name on it.	Tabi ohunkohun miiran pẹlu orukọ lori o.
A period of time.	A akoko ti akoko.

People will come out.	Eniyan yoo jade.
All went well at first.	Gbogbo lọ daradara ni akọkọ.
You can sell your music.	O le ta orin rẹ.
He looked inside her.	O wo inu rẹ.
I would love to get it one day, however.	Emi yoo fẹ lati gba ni ọjọ kan, sibẹsibẹ.
Maybe there are others who believe the same thing.	Boya awọn miiran wa ti wọn gbagbọ ohun kanna.
That's what you see.	Ohun ti o n rii niyẹn.
I asked what it was and he never told me.	Mo beere kini o jẹ ati pe ko sọ fun mi rara.
You are not worried.	O ko ni aniyan.
It changed.	O yi pada.
They will push him.	Wọn yoo ti i.
I didn’t start until pretty late.	Emi ko bẹrẹ titi lẹwa pẹ.
You just don’t know anything.	O kan ko mọ nkan kan.

And it's hard to talk.	Ati pe o nira lati sọrọ.
I sat around for another hour.	Mo joko ni ayika fun wakati miiran.
A new law has passed.	Ofin tuntun kan ti kọja.
You don’t want to do anything.	O ko fẹ ṣe ohunkohun.
I forgot to fear it.	Mo gbagbe lati bẹru rẹ.
That was why he had to get it from her.	Ti o wà idi ti o ni lati gba o lati rẹ.
But maybe not as hard as it seems.	Ṣugbọn boya kii ṣe lile bi o ṣe dabi.
They do not walk without their beds.	Wọn ko rin laisi ibusun wọn.
I love a life full of ideas.	Mo fẹran igbesi aye ti o kun fun awọn ero.
Systems will have to build.	Awọn ọna ṣiṣe yoo ni lati kọ.
It really became my community for the day.	Nkan naa gan di agbegbe mi fun ọjọ naa.
They just sat together, they said nothing.	Wọn kan joko papọ, wọn ko sọ ohunkohun.
But, at best, he didn’t have a father.	Ṣugbọn, ti o dara julọ, ko ni baba rẹ.
Now he will be there until morning.	Bayi oun yoo wa nibẹ titi di owurọ.
I'm glad you came.	Inu mi dun pe o wa.
You are here.	Ti o ba wa nibi.
I'm taking care of it.	Mo n tọju rẹ.
You should let them make friends.	O yẹ ki o jẹ ki wọn ṣe awọn ọrẹ.
You should come back today.	O yẹ ki o pada wa loni.
This has caused some problems.	Eyi ti fa awọn iṣoro diẹ.
Put it in the city car on time.	Gbe e sinu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ilu ni akoko.
You don’t know because you don’t stop to think.	O ko mọ nitori o ko da lati ro.
People in the store have said that these will be given.	Eniyan ti o wa ninu ile itaja ti sọ pe awọn wọnyi yoo fun ni.

Not finished, of course.	Ko pari, dajudaju.
It was the only thing that made sense.	O je nikan ni ohun ti o ṣe ori.
Not available.	Ko si.
No I do not.	Rara emi ko ni.
And he left.	Ati ki o lọ kuro.
At least it looks old.	O kere o dabi atijọ.

And that’s what he’s been doing.	Ati pe ohun ti o ti n ṣe niyẹn.
You have told him the truth.	O ti sọ otitọ fun u.
This may be due to the following factors.	Eyi le jẹ nitori awọn nkan wọnyi.
I don't want to die.	Nko fe e ku.
If they do, the group becomes young.	Ti wọn ba ṣẹlẹ, ẹgbẹ naa di ọdọ.

I am in the field program.	Mo wa ninu eto aaye.
Worried about who works hard.	Ni aniyan nipa ẹniti o ṣiṣẹ pupọ.
That's not it.	Kii ṣe iyẹn.
All the rivers go to the sea.	Gbogbo odo ni o lo si okun.
They will try to get out of whatever they can.	Wọn yoo gbiyanju lati jade ninu ohunkohun ti wọn ba le.
I didn’t notice it, but the other course did.	Emi ko ṣe akiyesi rẹ, ṣugbọn awọn miiran dajudaju ṣe.
He has been stolen from us.	O ti ji lati wa.
Some of them are picked up by others.	Diẹ ninu wọn ni a gbe soke nipasẹ awọn miiran.

Or delete anything that was on.	Tabi pa ohunkohun ti o wà lori.
He never left and made sure his voice was heard.	Ko fi silẹ rara o rii daju pe a gbọ ohun rẹ.
You have time, and lots of it.	O ni akoko, ati ọpọlọpọ rẹ.
What you say may be true.	Ohun ti o sọ le jẹ otitọ.
Maybe you are at work.	Boya o wa ni ibi iṣẹ.
What you say is very hurtful.	Ohun ti o sọ jẹ ipalara pupọ.
He knew he was coming.	O mọ pe o n bọ.
I do not know what.	Emi ko mọ kini.
It cannot be true, it cannot be true.	Ko le jẹ otitọ, ko le jẹ otitọ.
I just don’t think this will work.	Mo kan ko ro pe eyi yoo ṣiṣẹ.
I tried to talk to him.	Mo gbiyanju lati ba a sọrọ.
No one should be afraid.	Ko si ọkan yẹ ki o bẹru.
You can read that below.	O le ka iyẹn ni isalẹ.
Much happens.	Pupọ ṣẹlẹ.
I refused to eat that food.	Mo kọ lati jẹ ounjẹ yẹn.
He looked at me intently.	O wo mi gidigidi.

I have never had anything of my own.	Emi ko tii ni ohunkohun ti ara mi.
If we must.	Ti a ba gbọdọ.
Just walk out.	O kan rin jade.
I asked what.	Mo beere kini.
Turn off the heat before your meal.	Pa ooru silẹ ṣaaju ki ounjẹ rẹ to sun.
We must keep our promises.	A gbọdọ pa awọn ileri wa mọ.
At home there is no need to explain.	Ni ile ko nilo lati ṣe alaye.
Of course it is easy to learn here.	Dajudaju o rọrun lati kọ ẹkọ nibi.
No two people went through it the same.	Ko si eniyan meji ti o lọ nipasẹ rẹ kanna.
They are all friends.	Gbogbo wọn jẹ ọrẹ.
We saw a plane flying over the city.	A ri ọkọ ofurufu ti n fo lori ilu naa.
That is not the point.	Iyẹn kii ṣe aaye naa.
It seemed good to him.	O ti dabi pe o dara fun u.
Do not use force at all.	Maṣe lo agbara rara.
My husband bought me a new one but not the same.	Ọkọ mi ra tuntun kan fun mi ṣugbọn kii ṣe kanna.
Remember to keep your promise.	Ranti lati pa ileri rẹ mọ.

He does not know how to insert it.	Ko mọ bi a ṣe le fi sii.

There is a way to open it.	Ọna kan wa lati ṣii rẹ.
Buy a large bag, but do not open it.	Ra apo nla kan, ṣugbọn maṣe ṣi i.
This is very understandable to me.	Eyi jẹ oye pupọ si mi.
The money should reach me in three weeks.	Owo naa yẹ ki o de ọdọ mi ni ọsẹ mẹta.
Stand it out.	Duro o jade.
Don’t be hard on myself.	Maṣe jẹ lile lori ara mi.

It's true, you know.	Otitọ ni, o mọ.
The sun will rise again.	Oorun yoo tun dide.
You are the same height as my brother.	Iwọ ni giga kanna bi arakunrin mi.
I just know it doesn’t.	Mo kan mọ pe ko ṣe bẹ.
You do not even know how it happened.	O ko paapaa mọ bi o ṣe ṣẹlẹ.
Everyone else knows them.	Gbogbo eniyan miiran mọ wọn.
Who and who.	Wa da wa.
Try to get there early.	Gbiyanju lati de ibi ni kutukutu.
The kids in front of me reached for my hand.	Awọn ọmọde ti o wa ni iwaju ti de ọwọ mi.
You and your brother both.	Iwọ ati arakunrin rẹ mejeeji.
Office facilities with meeting rooms.	Awọn ohun elo ile-iṣẹ pẹlu awọn yara ipade.
Why you ?.	Kini idi ti iwọ?.
His wife and daughter stood behind him.	Iyawo ati ọmọbirin rẹ duro lẹhin.
Money is there more than we thought.	Owo wa nibẹ ju bi a ti ro lọ.
This is yours.	Eyi ni tirẹ.
The sun is setting over the sea.	Oorun ti n wọ̀ lori okun.
I can promise you that.	Mo le ṣe ileri fun ọ pe.
Take lots of pictures! 	Ya awọn aworan pupọ!
But men don’t really have that.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọkunrin ko ni iyẹn gaan.
You will remember me.	Iwọ yoo ranti mi.
Now, you have to accept, you accept.	Bayi, o ni lati gba, o gba.
How to do it.	Bawo ni lati ṣe rẹ.
None of them uttered a word.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o sọ ọrọ kan.
If there is a fire, it will freeze.	Ti ina ba wa, yoo di.
Something else could happen.	Nkankan miiran le ṣẹlẹ.
No more days.	Ko si ọjọ mọ.
Get out of a job.	Jade kuro ninu iṣẹ kan.
For them to be so.	Fun wọn lati jẹ bẹ.
You have to think about.	O ni lati ronu nipa.
A very, very long while.	A gan, gan gun nigba ti.
They are bad.	Wọn jẹ buburu.
Of course it is not easy to live at home.	Dajudaju ko rọrun lati gbe ile.
Just look at the world around you.	Kan wo aye ni ayika rẹ.
I was there for him when he needed me.	Mo wa nibẹ fun u nigbati o nilo mi.
However, in his eyes, this may not be the case.	Sibẹsibẹ, loju oju rẹ, eyi ko le jẹ bẹ.
This does not help.	Eyi ko ṣe iranlọwọ.
Try to turn it off and on again.	Gbiyanju lati pa a ati pada lẹẹkansi.
I learned a lot from your site.	Mo kọ ẹkọ pupọ lati aaye rẹ.
I think tomorrow will be better.	Mo ro pe ọla yoo dara julọ.
I should know that at this time without asking.	Mo yẹ ki o mọ pe ni akoko yii laisi beere.
Everyone agrees.	Gbogbo eniyan gba.
It can do wonders.	O le ṣe ohun iyanu.
He never taught anyone at all.	Ko kọ ẹnikẹni rara.
It will take time to get to know your child.	Yoo gba akoko lati mọ ọmọ rẹ.
It’s time to start growing up.	O to akoko ti o bẹrẹ lati dagba.
We started to spend time together.	A bẹrẹ lati lo akoko papọ.
You hear, you hear.	O gbọ, o gbọ.
There is no other explanation for the way it feels.	Ko si alaye miiran fun ọna ti o ni rilara.
It felt bad.	O ro iru buburu.
That did not happen to me.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ si mi.
I changed them.	Mo yi wọn pada.
Who said that?	Tani o sọ bẹẹ?
The decision was made.	A ṣe ipinnu naa si.
It shouldn’t be fun to hear that.	Ko yẹ ki o dun lati gbọ iyẹn.
It doesn’t seem too much for my favorites to perform around here.	Ko dabi pupọ fun awọn ayanfẹ mi lati ṣe ni ayika ibi.
You need to work on the last word.	O nilo lati ṣiṣẹ lori ọrọ ti o kẹhin.
We are not young.	A kii ṣe ọdọ.
We have explained how you need to know.	A ti ṣe alaye bi o ṣe nilo lati mọ.
On your way down.	Lori ọna rẹ si isalẹ.
But even today.	Sugbon paapaa loni.
He wants you to come home.	O fe ki o wa si ile.
And there seems to be only one way to do that.	Ati pe o dabi pe ọna kan nikan ni lati ṣe iyẹn.
They can and do.	Wọn le ati ṣe.
Let me hear.	Jẹ ki n gbọ.
He is my brother.	Arakunrin mi ni.
Up and down does not matter.	Soke ati isalẹ ko ṣe pataki.
Only if you know.	Ti o ba mọ nikan.
History is not interested in him.	Itan ko nifẹ si i.
I think it's really good.	Mo ro pe o dara gaan.
Decisions do not seem to be complete.	Awọn ipinnu ko dabi pe o pari.
He seemed very happy with his life.	O dabi enipe o dun pupọ pẹlu igbesi aye rẹ.
I have to get out of these clothes.	Mo gbọdọ jade ninu awọn aṣọ wọnyi.
This may be true.	Eyi le jẹ otitọ.
I agree, believe me, but it is very difficult.	Mo gba, gba mi gbọ, ṣugbọn o nira pupọ.
I run every morning.	Mo ṣiṣe ni gbogbo owurọ.
I try to imagine what happened.	Mo gbiyanju lati ro ero ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It can be worn all year round, indoors or outdoors.	O le wọ ni gbogbo ọdun, ninu ile tabi ita.
You have to wait for it.	O ni lati duro fun o.
The policeman is believed to have killed his wife.	Ọlọpa naa ni wọn gbagbọ pe o ti pa iyawo rẹ.
He did not stop.	Ko duro jẹ.
That car needs work.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yẹn nilo iṣẹ.
But they are not there yet.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko wa nibẹ sibẹsibẹ.
Just put your shoes on.	Kan gbe bata rẹ si.
I put them on the plane.	Mo fi wọn sinu ọkọ ofurufu.
As it is.	Bi o ti jẹ.
I'm not sure what to do.	Emi ko ni idaniloju kini lati ṣe.
He has told us everything.	O ti sọ ohun gbogbo fun wa.
He lives on the beach.	O ngbe lori eti okun.
I start with the front.	Mo bẹrẹ pẹlu iwaju.
They came to get me.	Won wa gba mi.
Below are some of my favorite pictures from the day.	Ni isalẹ wa diẹ ninu awọn aworan ayanfẹ mi lati gbogbo ọjọ.
This only stops when you close some applications.	Eyi ma duro nikan nigbati o ba pa diẹ ninu awọn ohun elo.
Therefore, it is in their gift to get it right.	Nitorina, o wa ninu ẹbun wọn lati gba o tọ.
No one knows why.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ idi.
I have no problem with that.	Emi ko ni iṣoro diẹ pẹlu iyẹn.
You do not have.	O ko ni.
You can't remember.	O ko le ranti.
This program in particular is very important.	Eto yii ni pataki jẹ pataki pupọ.
He will have an account for me.	Oun yoo ni iroyin fun mi.
No one has to say.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ni lati sọ.
Both are good.	Awọn mejeeji dara.
So he decided to go ahead with it.	Nitorina o pinnu lati tẹsiwaju daradara.
Do not break up.	Maṣe fọ dide.
He knew about me and hated me, he said.	O mọ nipa mi o si korira mi, o sọ.
Most people believe this.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan gbagbọ eyi.
I always wonder what the future holds.	Mo nigbagbogbo ṣe iyalẹnu kini ọjọ iwaju yoo mu.
I know you know how.	Mo mọ pe o mọ bi.
I hope to see you one day.	Mo nireti lati ri ọ ni ọjọ kan.
I like them.	Mo fẹ wọn.
None of them are looking their best.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o n wo ohun ti o dara julọ.
Be very much feeling things.	Jẹ gidigidi kan rilara ohun.
You did not see me.	O ko ri mi.
He began to reach his feet.	O bẹrẹ lati de ẹsẹ rẹ.
A few minutes at least.	Awọn iṣẹju diẹ o kere ju.
The city looks great.	Ilu naa dabi nla.
Sometimes they even reach the police.	Nigba miiran wọn paapaa de iwaju ọlọpa.
This is how you can go.	Eyi jẹ bi o ti le lọ.
We do so here.	A ṣe bẹ nibi.
I saw your picture.	Mo ti ri aworan rẹ.
We just don’t know anything else.	A o kan ko mọ ohunkohun miiran.
The book is full of information.	Iwe naa kun fun alaye.
She is his sister.	Arabinrin rẹ ni.
He bought many gifts for her.	O ra ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹbun fun u.
They always get some rewards.	Wọn nigbagbogbo gba awọn ere kan.
But we want to be parents.	Ṣugbọn a fẹ lati jẹ obi.
Some thought he was dead.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti a ro pe o ti ku.
If they have to, or even because they like it.	Ti wọn ba ni lati, tabi paapaa nitori wọn fẹran rẹ.
But, but, but.	Ṣugbọn, ṣugbọn, ṣugbọn.
Make out with someone at a bar.	Ṣe jade pẹlu ẹnikan ni a igi.
And a book.	Ati iwe kan.
I will not accept either.	Emi ko ni gba boya.
It’s time to just say, no.	O to akoko lati kan sọ, rara.
I do not have.	Emi ko ni.
I mean you’re calling back and you’re calling back.	Mo tumọ si pe o n pe pada ati pe o n pe pada.
Discover as many new things as you can.	Ṣe akiyesi ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan tuntun bi o ṣe le.
And why they would not.	Ati idi ti won yoo ko.
That was good for me, he thought to himself.	Iyẹn dara fun mi, o ronu ninu ara rẹ.
We do not mean that.	A ko tumọ si iyẹn.
They think it works for them.	Wọn ro pe o ṣiṣẹ fun wọn.
I have nothing to do with it.	Emi ko ṣe nkankan pẹlu rẹ.
This is music, sound, and more than anything in my ear.	Eyi jẹ orin, ohun, ati pe o ju nkan lọ ni eti mi.
Who naturally.	Ta nipa ti.
I like music.	Mo feran orin.
You wear a watch when they see you.	O wọ aago kan nigbati wọn ri ọ.
Just come here and nothing happens.	O kan wa nibi ati pe ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
They bring stress.	Wọn mu wahala.
We want to build a good school.	A fẹ kọ ile-iwe to dara.
On the one hand, at least.	Ni ẹgbẹ kan, o kere ju.
He shook his eye.	O mi oju rẹ.
We do not always have that opportunity in life.	A ko nigbagbogbo ni anfani yẹn ni igbesi aye.
But it depends on the situation.	Ṣugbọn o da lori ipo naa.
The sister will not come back home, visit.	Arabinrin ko ni pada wa si ile, ṣabẹwo si.
Naturally, they are not.	Nipa ti, wọn kii ṣe.
No one is home.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa ni ile.
This gives us more time to be alive.	Eyi fun wa ni akoko diẹ sii lati wa laaye.
He sat back again.	O si joko pada lẹẹkansi.
You need energy.	O nilo agbara.
They have no jobs.	Wọn ko ni awọn iṣẹ.
We do not need any of these books.	A ko nilo ọkan ninu awọn iwe wọnyi.
Again, not every strategy you try will work.	Lẹẹkansi, kii ṣe gbogbo imọran ti o gbiyanju yoo ṣiṣẹ.
He, know who he is.	Oun, mọ ẹniti o jẹ.
You can wait.	O le duro.
I have no water with me.	Emi ko ni omi pẹlu mi.
Both at the same time.	Mejeeji ni akoko kanna.
She’s trying to tell me the whole story.	O n gbiyanju lati sọ gbogbo itan naa fun mi.
Read below for more information.	Ka ni isalẹ fun alaye diẹ sii.
They cannot move.	Wọn ko le gbe.
His thoughts are completely astonishing.	Awọn ero rẹ jẹ iyalẹnu patapata.
The weather has improved a bit, if any.	Oju ojo ti dara si diẹ, ti o ba jẹ eyikeyi.
My eyes never left yours.	Oju mi ​​ko kuro ni tirẹ.
But there are ways to go beyond it.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọna wa lati kọja rẹ.
Or the boy.	Tabi ọmọkunrin naa.
It 's too late for an appointment.	O pẹ fun ipinnu lati pade rẹ.
Have a great day!.	Ojo re oni a dara gan ni!.
Of course now, your.	Dajudaju bayi, rẹ.
And I am happy to be with you.	Ati pe inu mi dun lati wa pẹlu mi.
As he re-dressed, his thoughts returned to the girl.	Bi o ti tun wọ aṣọ, awọn ero rẹ pada si ọmọbirin naa.
Good to pick me up.	O dara lati gbe mi.
I want the team to know what happened, that we left.	Mo fẹ ki ẹgbẹ naa mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ, pe a lọ kuro.
Turn on the lights.	Yipada awọn ina.
Almost more than a story.	O fẹrẹ to ju itan kan lọ.
I have not forgotten it.	Emi ko gbagbe rẹ.
Interesting and art.	Awon ati aworan.
For me, that tells my story.	Fun mi, iyẹn n sọ itan mi.
Now you do.	Bayi o ṣe.
All my hair stood on end.	Gbogbo irun ara mi ni o dide.
It will be very, very good.	Yoo jẹ pupọ, pupọ dara julọ.
Without a word he got into the car.	Laisi ọrọ kan o wọ inu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
I give you money, here.	Mo fun ọ ni owo, nibi.
I wasn’t home much that summer.	Emi ko wa ni ile pupọ ni igba ooru yẹn.
You have exhausted them.	O ti re wọn.
Other companies charge higher fees.	Awọn ile-iṣẹ miiran gba owo ti o ga julọ.
The work was done very well.	Iṣẹ naa ni a ṣe daradara julọ.
I think he left me in that.	Mo ro pe o fi mi silẹ ninu iyẹn.
I looked at the phone for a long time.	Mo wo foonu naa fun igba pipẹ.
It does not rain in the summer.	O ko ojo ni ooru.
We must just take note.	A gbọdọ kan gba akiyesi.
He usually travels alone.	O maa n rin irin-ajo nikan.
But he knew the problem, at least.	Ṣugbọn o mọ iṣoro naa, o kere ju.
So to speak.	Nitorina lati sọ.
He was intelligent.	O si wà ni oye inu.
Turn your head away.	Yi ori rẹ kuro.
Your interest will come.	Anfani rẹ yoo wa.
Take them for now.	Mu wọn fun bayi.
I don’t think any of you have that idea.	Emi ko ro pe eyikeyi ninu yin ni ero yẹn.
Do not talk too much.	Maṣe sọrọ pupọ.
You think this is a big mistake.	O ro pe eyi jẹ aṣiṣe nla kan.
They can't take me away.	Wọn ko le mu mi kuro.
There seems to be nothing to do.	O dabi pe ko si nkankan lati ṣe.
But they can wait for us downstairs.	Ṣugbọn wọn le duro de wa ni isalẹ.
And it should change.	Ati pe o yẹ ki o yipada.
He stopped to look at his daughter.	O duro lati wo ọmọbirin rẹ.
Cars ran over his feet.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ran lori ẹsẹ rẹ.
Lots of good friends too.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ to dara paapaa.
We are forced to take advantage.	A fi agbara mu anfani.
Sorry about all this, you know.	Ma binu nipa gbogbo eyi, o mọ.
Do not open the door for anyone.	Maṣe ṣi ilẹkun fun ẹnikẹni.
Go find it.	Lọ wa a.
Soon it was morning.	Laipẹ o jẹ owurọ.
This is not my home anymore.	Eyi kii ṣe ile mi mọ.
He lives in a fireplace.	O ngbe ni ile ina.
It was something we made up.	O je ohun ti a ṣe soke.
I have my own.	Mo ni ti ara mi.
At this time.	Ni akoko yii.
I look at the moment again.	Mo tun wo akoko naa lẹẹkansi.
High school students who no longer work may leave other information.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe giga ti ko ṣiṣẹ mọ le fi alaye miiran silẹ.
That has a very good reason.	Ti o ni idi ti o dara julọ.
It should have taken advantage of the opportunity to grow.	O yẹ ki o ti lo anfani lati dagba.
As a child, he always took and did things.	Bi ọmọde, o nigbagbogbo ya ati ṣe awọn nkan.
I can handle the application.	Mo le mu ohun elo naa.
Must have returned to his boat.	Gbọdọ ti pada si ọkọ oju omi rẹ.
Just walk away.	O kan rin kuro.
Just change one thing.	O kan yi ohun kan.
I have let it down many times before.	Mo ti jẹ ki rẹ silẹ ni ọpọlọpọ igba ṣaaju ki o to.
It just isn’t all the work.	O kan kii ṣe gbogbo iṣẹ naa.
They did it right.	Wọn ṣe e gaan.
No, he did not say a word.	Rara, ko sọ ọrọ kan.
You are gone.	O ti lọ.
I can tell people to do things.	Mo le sọ fun eniyan lati ṣe awọn nkan.
Ask people.	Beere awọn eniyan.
Do the best you can with everything.	Ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ ti o le pẹlu ohun gbogbo.
Now his forehead light is completely out.	Bayi ina iwaju rẹ ti jade patapata.
They asked me, even, you see.	Wọn beere fun mi, paapaa, o rii.
Who let the dog out?	Tani o jẹ ki aja naa jade?
I love all of that, especially.	Mo fẹran gbogbo iyẹn, paapaa.
The last of them.	Ti o kẹhin ninu wọn.
Not the least.	Ko si ni o kere ju.
We need to find this person before anything happens.	A nilo lati wa eniyan yii ṣaaju ki ohunkohun to ṣẹlẹ.
I'm glad it's good.	Inu mi dun pe o dara.
Students expect to attend classes regularly.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe nireti lati wa si awọn kilasi nigbagbogbo.
This is a surprising fact.	Eyi jẹ otitọ iyalẹnu kan.
I do not know what you are talking about.	Emi ko mọ kini o n sọrọ nipa.
I told them we needed this room.	Mo sọ fun wọn pe a nilo yara yii.
As you say, money and power.	Bi o ti sọ, owo ati agbara.
That’s until you get to your office.	Iyẹn jẹ titi o fi de ọfiisi rẹ.
He moved.	O gbe.
It will kill him.	Yoo pa a.
He also did not know the name.	Oun naa ko mọ orukọ naa.
He could not accept that the whole class was watching him.	O ko le gba pe gbogbo kilasi n wo oun.
Okay, maybe we are.	O dara, boya a jẹ.
I'm still looking up.	Mo tun n wo soke.
I am fine now.	Mo ti dara ni bayi.
Others need to be cut off.	Awọn miiran nilo lati ge kuro.
Do not leave your side.	Maṣe fi ẹgbẹ rẹ silẹ.
This is the house that happened.	Eyi ni ile ti o ti ṣẹlẹ.
The phone rang and he picked it up.	Foonu naa ti dun o si gbe e.
And you can't.	Ati pe iwọ ko le.
I'll take him home now.	Emi yoo mu u lọ si ile ni bayi.
You want to eat something else.	O fẹ lati jẹ nkan miiran.
Even to this day.	Paapaa titi di oni.
It’s about the truth you want to live through.	O jẹ nipa otitọ ti o fẹ lati gbe nipasẹ.
This can be done for three times.	Eyi le ṣee ṣe fun igba mẹta.
They don’t even deserve to talk to each other.	Wọn ko paapaa yẹ lati ba ara wọn sọrọ.
You get it completely.	O gba ọ patapata.
That seemed easy at first.	Iyẹn dabi ẹni pe o rọrun ni akọkọ.
However, we are all wondering.	Sibẹsibẹ, gbogbo wa ni iyalẹnu.
There is no place in history to write.	Ko si aaye kankan ninu itan lati kọ.
They also have trouble.	Wọn tun ni wahala.
I poured water on the whole book.	Mo da omi si gbogbo iwe naa.
She saw the boy.	O ri ọmọkunrin naa.
The house, he said, is not the same without them.	Ile naa, o sọ pe, kii ṣe kanna laisi wọn.
I will not.	Emi ko ni rara.
Someone to give everything for.	Ẹnikan lati fi ohun gbogbo fun.
That is for sure.	Iyẹn jẹ daju.
He put his eyes on her.	O si fi oju rẹ si ọwọ rẹ.
And the money they make.	Ati owo ti wọn ṣe.
It was for the best.	O je fun awọn ti o dara ju.
Some people will love it for you.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan yoo nifẹ rẹ fun ọ.
It is going to happen.	O ti wa ni lilọ lati ṣẹlẹ.
He did not move.	Ko gbe.
Given this task, they find it easy.	Ti a ti fun wọn ni iṣẹ yii, wọn rii pe o rọrun.
However, there are some issues.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ọrọ kan wa.
I started to get a little scared.	Mo bẹrẹ si bẹru diẹ.
I tell you it will not be so.	Mo sọ fun ọ pe kii yoo jẹ bẹ.
I know in myself.	Mo mọ ninu ara mi.
The man looked at the picture on the table.	Ọkunrin naa wo aworan ti o wa lori tabili.
He turned and turned to me.	O yipada o si yipada si mi.
I wonder how that feels.	Mo ṣe iyalẹnu bawo ni iyẹn ṣe rilara rẹ.
It is good to be so.	O dara lati jẹ bẹ.
Raise.	Gbe soke.
After my graduation I continued to work there.	Lẹhin ayẹyẹ ipari ẹkọ mi o tẹsiwaju lati ṣiṣẹ nibẹ.
No one was killed.	Ko si ọkan ti a pa.
Let me tell you, it's not good.	Jẹ ki n sọ fun ọ, ko dara.
We talked for hours.	A sọrọ fun awọn wakati.
You will love that, too.	Iwọ yoo fẹ iyẹn, paapaa.
He hit home.	O lu ile.
Start with a few things.	Bẹrẹ pẹlu awọn nkan diẹ.
How did you find it.	Bawo ni o ṣe ri i.
His eyes became yours.	Oju rẹ di tirẹ.
The long hours on your feet have taken their toll.	Awọn wakati pipẹ lori ẹsẹ rẹ ti gba agbara wọn.
I love this moment.	Mo nifẹ akoko yii.
I can't do much.	Nko le se pupo.
You should know.	O yẹ ki o mọ.
The wait time is.	Akoko duro jẹ.
And everything worked out as expected.	Ati pe ohun gbogbo ṣiṣẹ bi o ṣe yẹ.
Make appointments and be on time.	Ṣe awọn ipinnu lati pade ki o wa ni akoko.
But, don’t miss the end.	Ṣugbọn, maṣe padanu ipari naa.
Not bad and not great.	Ko buburu ati ki o ko nla.
A house like this.	Ile bi eleyi.
He looked at it, and put it back.	O wo o, o si fi i pada.
There is a fire here.	Ina kan wa nibi.
Your mother promises you that you will have a good time.	Iya rẹ ṣe ileri fun ọ pe iwọ yoo ni akoko ti o dara.
I can’t tell you how my heart went out to them.	Emi ko le sọ fun ọ bi ọkan mi ṣe jade si wọn.
Have you ever had that.	Njẹ o ti ni iyẹn.
Sometimes it’s not as good a team as other teams.	Nigba miiran kii ṣe ẹgbẹ ti o dara bi awọn ẹgbẹ miiran.
I don’t know why people would say that.	Emi ko mọ idi ti eniyan yoo sọ bẹ.
I want to know everything.	Mo fẹ lati mọ ohun gbogbo.
But it's good.	Sugbon o dara.
I would love your insights.	Emi yoo fẹ awọn oye rẹ.
You can enjoy it and also learn about it.	O le gbadun rẹ ki o tun kọ ẹkọ nipa rẹ.
I tried to bring him back.	Mo gbiyanju lati mu u pada.
When was the last time you laughed?	Nigbawo ni akoko ikẹhin ti o rẹrin?
There are over 30 people present.	O ju ọgbọn eniyan lo wa bayi.
Her brother lives and works there.	Arakunrin rẹ ngbe ati ṣiṣẹ nibẹ.
A few days ago he saw some dead people.	Ni ọjọ diẹ sẹhin o rii diẹ ninu awọn ku eniyan.
Before he died, he expressed his love.	Ṣaaju ki o to ku, o sọ ifẹ rẹ.
When he arrived, the police were already there.	Nigbati o de, awọn ọlọpa ti wa tẹlẹ.
We don’t work, they work.	A ko ṣiṣẹ, wọn ṣiṣẹ.
They want to know what we are doing.	Wọn fẹ lati mọ ohun ti a n ṣe.
The advent of fire has changed the way people work.	Awọn dide ti ina ti yi pada awọn ọna eniyan ṣiṣẹ.
Just in my imagination.	O kan ni oju inu mi.
I mean, you can.	Mo tumọ si, o le.
The group is already thinking.	Ẹgbẹ naa ti ni ero tẹlẹ.
We have had our problems as we grow up.	A ti ni awọn iṣoro wa bi a ti dagba.
Of course not men.	Dajudaju kii ṣe awọn ọkunrin.
I do this for many reasons.	Mo ṣe eyi fun ọpọlọpọ awọn idi.
We need to have both.	A nilo lati ni awọn mejeeji.
I'm sorry, boy.	Ma binu, ọmọkunrin.
They worry about some people in the group.	Wọn ṣe aniyan nipa awọn eniyan diẹ ninu ẹgbẹ naa.
More rain in summer than winter.	Ojo diẹ sii ni igba ooru ju igba otutu lọ.
So a good deal.	Nitorina adehun ti o dara.
The first are so few of them.	Ni igba akọkọ ti ni o wa ki diẹ ninu wọn.
Maybe this is the first.	Boya eyi ni akọkọ.
If it is for a while.	Ti o ba jẹ fun igba diẹ.
Again, he asked about working.	Lẹẹkansi, o beere nipa ṣiṣẹ.
Let's talk so we can get to know each other.	Jẹ ki a sọrọ ki a le mọ ara wa.
A really great person.	A gan nla eniyan.
It is impossible to understand their words.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati loye ọrọ wọn.
It will definitely give you an ear.	O dajudaju yoo fun ọ ni eti.
It has been like this for the last two weeks.	O ti wa bi eleyi fun ọsẹ meji to kọja.
Try to understand yourself.	Gbiyanju lati ni oye ara rẹ.
I hear it every few days.	Mo gbọ ni gbogbo ọjọ diẹ.
Some people believe that life on other planets is possible.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan gbagbọ pe igbesi aye lori awọn aye aye miiran ṣee ṣe.
There is no need to improve.	Ko si idi lati mu dara.
She spent a lot of time on her hair.	O lo akoko pupọ lori irun ori rẹ.
See music.	Wo orin.
And another, finish.	Ati miiran, pari.
We want information.	A fẹ alaye.
You get out.	O gba jade.
Until that time you did not think seriously of going to a doctor.	Titi di akoko yẹn o ko ronu ni pataki ti lilọ si dokita kan.
There are several methods to use.	Awọn ọna pupọ lo wa lati lo.
He decided to finish the job on time.	O pinnu lati pari iṣẹ naa ni akoko.
We do not make love like this.	A ko ṣe ifẹ bi eyi.
He lost hearing from his mouth.	O padanu lati gbọ lati ẹnu rẹ.
But he gave me a mistake.	Ṣugbọn o fun mi ni aṣiṣe.
I have lost a lot of my life.	Mo ti padanu pupo ti aye mi.
Unseen completed.	Ti a ko ri pari.
Clothes out.	Awọn aṣọ jade.
But he doesn't know why, either.	Ṣugbọn ko mọ idi, boya.
Everyone is looking at everyone else.	Gbogbo eniyan n wo gbogbo eniyan miiran.
You may have to return it several times at first.	O le ni lati da a pada ni ọpọlọpọ igba ni akọkọ.
You can kill.	O le pa.
Travel costs money.	Irin-ajo n gba owo.
Feel what they feel.	Lero ohun ti wọn lero.
There is something you do not want to see.	Ohun kan wa ti ko fẹ ki o rii.
You know what you do.	O mọ ohun ti o ṣe.
You know, the cost of money.	O mọ, iye owo ti owo.
For me, that changes the scene.	Fun mi, iyẹn n yi aaye naa pada.
Read it now.	Ka ni bayi.
I will, especially.	Emi yoo, paapaa.
So more away.	Nitorina diẹ sii kuro.
We will live in a month or so.	A yoo gbe ni oṣu kan tabi bẹ.
Much less bring your child with you.	Elo kere mu ọmọ rẹ pẹlu rẹ.
If not, they should be.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, wọn yẹ ki o jẹ.
Books can be read, but pictures cannot be taken.	Awọn iwe le ṣee ka, ṣugbọn awọn aworan ko le ya.
Someone woke up.	Ẹnikan ji.
I believe we are better than bad.	Mo gbagbọ pe a dara ju buburu lọ.
That alone, 'he said.	Iyẹn nikan,' o sọ.
But it's old really fast.	Sugbon o ni atijọ gan sare.
Now let’s be serious.	Bayi jẹ ki a ṣe pataki.
However, the surprising moments changed that fact.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn iṣẹju iyalẹnu yipada otitọ yẹn.
I seemed from the bottom of it.	Mo dabi enipe lati isalẹ inu rẹ.
This works well for some people.	Eyi ṣiṣẹ daradara fun diẹ ninu awọn eniyan.
Across the rooms you end up with it.	Kọja awọn yara ti o mu soke pẹlu rẹ.
Most of them came out.	Ọpọlọpọ wọn wa jade.
That may be more of a way to get it.	Iyẹn le jẹ ọna diẹ sii lati gba.
Find out if all the information is true.	Mọ boya gbogbo alaye jẹ otitọ.
I am always with him.	Mo wa pẹlu rẹ nigbagbogbo.
You speak from your heart to yours.	O sọ lati ọkan rẹ si tirẹ.
There is no way off.	Ko ọna kan kuro.
I can’t continue like this forever.	Emi ko le tẹsiwaju bi eyi lailai.
But that is all to the good.	Sugbon ti o jẹ gbogbo si awọn ti o dara.
They have not arrested me.	Wọn ko ti mu mi.
I will give up my head and so on.	Emi yoo fi ori mi silẹ ati bẹ bẹ yoo ṣe.
All you have to do is ask.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ni lati ṣe ni beere.
We have some time to sleep.	A ni akoko diẹ lati sun.
We love our two children.	A nifẹ awọn ọmọ wa mejeeji.
I really should go.	Mo yẹ ki o lọ gba gaan.
It was the right thing to do.	O jẹ ohun ti o tọ.
She has a gift she loves.	O ni ẹbun ti o nifẹ.
We are not promised to do that.	A ko ṣe ileri lati ṣe iyẹn.
It let me sell the team.	O jẹ ki n ta ẹgbẹ naa.
But that, of course, is not true.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn, dajudaju, kii ṣe otitọ.
Okay, let me tell you this.	O dara, jẹ ki n sọ eyi fun ọ.
There is something that tells you that this is an office building.	Ohun kan wa ti o sọ fun ọ pe ile ọfiisi ni eyi.
We hope this information has helped.	A nireti pe alaye yii ti ṣe iranlọwọ.
Pretty much it is.	Lẹwa o jẹ.
I was very scared and did not know what to do.	Mo bẹru pupọ ati pe ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
Something special to do.	Nkankan pataki lati ṣe.
That was a good one.	Iyẹn jẹ ọkan ti o dara.
The teams are not good.	Awọn ẹgbẹ ko dara.
Now sit back and enjoy the day.	Bayi joko pada ki o gbadun ọjọ naa.
Two students were killed.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe meji ti pa.
It also changed.	O tun yipada.
Maybe something is not so good.	Boya ohun kan ko dara bẹ.
The road is gone.	Ọna naa ti lọ.
Use it the right way.	Lo o ni ọna ti o tọ.
You have no money to make.	O ko ni owo lati ṣe.
You may not do this, however.	O le ma ṣe eyi, sibẹsibẹ.
I will be forever.	Emi yoo wa lailai.
It has already been his home.	O ti jẹ ile rẹ.
Work is done.	Iṣẹ ṣiṣe ti pari.
However, most people do not have a place to start.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọpọlọpọ eniyan ko ni ibiti o bẹrẹ.
It was such a test for him.	O jẹ iru idanwo bẹ fun u.
He held a hand to his face.	O di ọwọ kan si oju rẹ.
We can see what can happen.	A le rii ohun ti o le ṣẹlẹ.
But you are right, really.	Ṣugbọn o tọ, ni pataki.
Say it was my husband.	Sọ pe ọkọ mi ni.
I am not afraid.	Emi ko bẹru.
He is in everything, everywhere.	O wa ninu ohun gbogbo, nibi gbogbo.
It has to be hard.	O ni lati jẹ lile.
You don't have time to run.	O ko ni akoko lati sare.
Not much to build a house about in the store.	Ko ṣe pupọ lati kọ ile nipa ni ile itaja.
There you have it.	Nibẹ ni o ni.
This goes one of two ways.	Eleyi lọ ọkan ninu awọn ọna meji.
And the man needs to be a woman.	Ati pe eniyan naa nilo lati jẹ obinrin.
The feet do not stand out.	Awọn ẹsẹ ko duro jade.
They will be there again in a year.	Wọn yoo tun wa nibẹ ni ọdun kan.
I think we have to do.	Mo ro pe a ni lati ṣe.
We have no reason to be childish itself.	A ko ni idi lati ṣe ọmọde funrararẹ.
No, really scared.	Rara, gan bẹru.
This is a police operation.	Eyi jẹ iṣẹ ọlọpa kan.
Therefore, they should not be brought together.	Nitorina, wọn ko yẹ ki o mu papọ.
Nothing has been stolen.	Ko si ohun ti a ti ji.
You have money to build.	O ni owo lati kọ.
No one should do that.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o yẹ ki o ṣe bẹ.
I did, and it wasn't pretty.	Mo ti ṣe, ati pe ko lẹwa.
Contact me for any questions on this.	Kan si mi fun eyikeyi ibeere lori eyi.
You have to put it in the game.	O ni lati fi sii ni ere.
Make sure to lock your front door.	Rii daju lati tii ilẹkun iwaju rẹ.
They have run out of energy.	Wọn ti lọ kuro ni agbara.
So he said.	Nitorina o sọ.
It was nice to have someone there for me.	O dara lati jẹ ki ẹnikan wa nibẹ fun mi.
To raise a family.	Lati gbe idile kan.
You can also contact us.	O tun le kan si wa.
You have no interest in these things.	O ko ni anfani ni nkan wọnyi.
We will use them again.	A yoo tun lo wọn lẹẹkansi.
No one knows about the man.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ nipa ọkunrin naa.
But it does not happen very often.	Sugbon o ko ni ṣẹlẹ gan igba.
He reached his feet and walked out of the room.	O de ẹsẹ rẹ o si jade kuro ninu yara naa.
Not very happy about this place.	Ko dun pupọ nipa ibi yii.
How long can they last.	Bawo ni wọn ṣe le pẹ to.
These methods just don’t work for him.	Awọn ọna wọnyi ko kan ṣiṣẹ fun u.
But how do you look at it.	Ṣugbọn bi o ti ṣe wo rẹ.
He handled it pretty well.	O si mu o lẹwa daradara.
After buying bread, he crossed the road	Lẹhin ti o ti ra akara, o kọja ni opopona
We found her phone and called her sister.	A ri foonu rẹ a si pe arabinrin rẹ.
It was very, very hard to get out of that.	O jẹ pupọ, lile pupọ lati kuro ni nkan naa.
His life did not go well.	Igbesi aye rẹ ko lọ daradara.
There is no way you want it.	Ko si ọna ti o fẹ rẹ.
They will just be removed when the vehicle is available.	Wọn yoo kan yọ kuro nigbati ọkọ ba wa.
There are others as well.	Awọn miiran tun wa.
Public facilities will be available only if needed.	Awọn ile-iṣẹ ti gbogbo eniyan yoo wa nikan bi o ba nilo.
But enough of that.	Sugbon to ti ti.
It's pretty good there.	O dara julọ nibẹ.
Sun for services only.	Oorun fun awọn iṣẹ nikan.
It works well on the device.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara lori ẹrọ naa.
And he moved.	O si gbe.
We love her more than our parents.	A nifẹ rẹ diẹ sii ju awọn obi wa lọ.
Pictures are here.	Awọn aworan wa nibi.
Let me ask you.	Jẹ ki n beere lọwọ rẹ.
I have a good sense of people.	Mo ni kan ti o dara ori ti awọn eniyan.
I don’t take that personally.	Emi ko gba ti ara ẹni yẹn.
However, there is a problem.	Sibẹsibẹ, iṣoro naa wa.
You have no world of that.	O ko ni aye ti iyẹn.
Not everyone is that way, however.	Kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan ni ọna yẹn, sibẹsibẹ.
This is also true.	Eyi tun jẹ otitọ.
You just want a vacation.	O kan fẹ isinmi kan.
We want to have things.	A fẹ lati ni awọn nkan.
Can you hear me now?	Ṣe o le gbọ mi ni bayi?
He rejected them.	O kọ wọn silẹ.
I'm glad, for you, that you have one.	Inu mi dun, fun ọ, pe o ni ọkan.
You will be fine.	Iwọ yoo dara.
Some of them say where they got the table.	Diẹ ninu wọn sọ ibi ti wọn ti gba tabili naa.
And he broke it himself.	O si fọ o funrararẹ.
Not for nothing, but it was great in there.	Ko fun ohunkohun, ṣugbọn o wà nla ni nibẹ.
That’s not very easy these days.	Iyẹn ko rọrun pupọ ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
I had never seen him around here before.	Emi ko tii ri i ni ayika ibi ṣaaju ki o to.
Most people will be angry.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan yoo binu.
You’re doing it on your own.	O n ṣe o lori ara rẹ.
And two weeks later he died again.	Ati lẹhin ọsẹ meji o tun ti ku.
First you don't need one.	Ni akọkọ ko nilo ọkan.
Some people don’t think it should be done.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ko ro pe o yẹ ki o ṣe.
He asked me to call in his office.	O beere fun mi lati pe ni ọfiisi rẹ.
Mo fe e pupo.	Mo fe e pupo.
I have taken care of myself since then.	Mo ti tọju ara mi lati igba naa.
In my plan.	Ninu eto mi.
Okay, let's go.	O dara, jẹ ki a lọ.
I think the rest is good for me.	Mo ro pe isinmi ti dara fun mi.
It meant nothing to him.	Ko tumọ si nkankan fun u.
Life for a living.	Igbesi aye fun igbesi aye kan.
And at that time they would lock him.	Ati ni akoko yẹn wọn yoo tii i.
Some of them do too.	Diẹ ninu wọn tun ṣe.
We ate.	A jẹ ounjẹ.
This tree is small.	Igi yii jẹ kekere kan.
And they did forever.	Ati pe wọn ṣe lailai.
Therefore, it cannot be.	Nitorina, ko le rara.
Mothers are always there.	Awọn iya maa wà.
I live here now.	Mo n gbe nibi bayi.
They left the house early, hoping to get seats.	Wọn fi ile silẹ ni kutukutu, nireti lati gba awọn ijoko.
You will not be able to bring me back.	Iwọ kii yoo ni anfani lati mu mi pada.
However, the high school students did much better.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ọmọ ile-iwe giga ṣe dara julọ dara julọ.
If possible.	Ti o ba ṣeeṣe.
The pictures were there again.	Awọn aworan wà nibẹ lẹẹkansi.
You only need me and me.	O nilo emi ati emi nikan.
We just refuse to let it save us.	A kan kọ lati jẹ ki o gba wa silẹ.
You can look inside as you like.	O le wo inu bi o ṣe fẹ.
You are looking for something special.	O n wa nkan pataki.
Most people can't do that.	Pupọ eniyan ko le ṣe iyẹn.
We ate a few of them.	A jẹ kekere diẹ ninu wọn.
Get anything.	Gba ohunkohun.
I said it was right.	Mo sọ pe o tọ.
That means no games will be played.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe ko si awọn ere ti yoo ṣe.
That's my game.	Iyẹn ni ere mi.
But it simply cannot be completed in this way.	Ṣugbọn o rọrun ko le pari ni ọna yii.
Use any of this time.	Lo eyikeyi akoko yii.
The sun will soon set.	Oorun yoo wọ laipẹ.
However, they did not remember the man.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn ko ranti eniyan naa.
She wants nothing but sleep now.	O fe nkankan sugbon sun bayi.
He makes them laugh, but stops when he sees me.	O n mu wọn rẹrin, ṣugbọn duro nigbati o ri mi.
But it may seem like it's a baby again.	Ṣugbọn o le bi o ti dabi pe o jẹ ọmọ lẹẹkansi.
He’s a big boy now.	O jẹ ọmọkunrin nla ni bayi.
I would like to talk to you.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ba ọ sọrọ.
I have no information at all.	Emi ko ni alaye rara.
I hope they can.	Mo nireti pe wọn le.
You have to let them understand.	O ni lati jẹ ki wọn loye.
You should know that this cannot be easy.	O yẹ ki o mọ pe ko le rọrun yii.
I am very scared.	Mo n bẹru pupọ.
I don’t believe either.	Emi ko gbagbọ boya.
I haven’t been there yet, and it won’t be for long.	Emi ko wa nibẹ sibẹsibẹ, ati pe kii yoo wa fun igba pipẹ.
I have long past those days.	Mo ti gun ti o ti kọja awon ọjọ.
She has been in love with him all this time.	O ti nifẹ pẹlu rẹ ni gbogbo akoko yii.
They went home.	Wọn lọ si ile.
Look in.	Wo inu.
One goes like two.	Ọkan lọ bi meji.
But there is another side to it.	Ṣugbọn ẹgbẹ miiran wa si i.
Winter is coming.	Igba otutu n bọ.
I can't believe it's gone.	Emi ko le gbagbọ pe o ti lọ.
He had never been about to hit her.	O ti ko ti nipa lati lu rẹ.
He was here around thirty-three after leaving work.	O wa nibi ni ayika ọgbọn mẹta lẹhin ti o ti kuro ni iṣẹ.
You have to give me that, especially.	O ni lati fun mi ni iyẹn, paapaa.
More than anything, he was afraid of running into it.	Ju ohunkohun lọ, o bẹru ti sare sinu rẹ.
And the price they promised is very good.	Ati pe owo ti wọn ṣe ileri dara pupọ.
I can’t say much about it here yet.	Emi ko le sọ pupọ nipa rẹ nibi sibẹsibẹ.
What to write is not known.	Ohun ti yoo kọ ko mọ.
Find a way to make something work.	Wa ọna lati jẹ ki nkan ṣiṣẹ.
I have never written one before.	Emi ko ti kọ ọkan tẹlẹ.
But it is easy to miss this.	Ṣugbọn o rọrun lati padanu eyi.
This is your big world.	Eyi ni aye nla rẹ.
There is a lot of work to be done to do this.	Iṣẹ pupọ wa lati ṣe lati ṣe eyi.
This is not how it works.	Eyi kii ṣe bii o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
That can be important.	Iyẹn le ṣe pataki.
They need an understanding area.	Wọn nilo agbegbe oye.
You are gone.	O ti lọ.
He moved to the big city.	O gbe lọ si ilu nla naa.
Nothing serious.	Ko si ohun to ṣe pataki.
A very old boy was sitting behind him.	Ọmọkunrin ti o dagba pupọ julọ ti joko lẹhin rẹ.
All the police are at sea.	Gbogbo awọn ọlọpa wa ni okun.
You go, you.	Iwọ lọ, iwọ.
Love, not want.	Ni ife, ko fẹ.
It’s easy, when you eat, just eat.	O rọrun, nigbati o ba jẹun, kan jẹun.
What a story.	Kini itan kan.
It doesn’t happen overnight and it’s not easy.	Ko ṣẹlẹ ni ọjọ kan ati pe ko rọrun.
We should continue.	A yẹ ki o tẹsiwaju.
If you have something to do, let it do it.	Ti o ba ni nkan lati ṣe, jẹ ki o ṣe.
Those people missed the whole point.	Awọn eniyan yẹn padanu gbogbo aaye naa.
Yours and yours.	Tirẹ ati tirẹ.
You have found yourself feeling.	O ti ri ara rẹ rilara.
He was always in trouble at school.	Nigbagbogbo o wa ninu wahala ni ile-iwe.
Take it all.	Mu gbogbo re.
It will not kill me.	Ko ni pa mi.
But there is a big issue.	Ṣugbọn ọrọ nla kan wa.
That is their life, that is their life.	Iyẹn ni igbesi aye wọn, iyẹn ni igbesi aye wọn.
Everything below me is small.	Ohun gbogbo ti o wa ni isalẹ mi jẹ kekere.
No one talked about it.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọrọ nipa rẹ.
Some of these are in boxes under a table.	Diẹ ninu awọn wọnyi wa ninu awọn apoti labẹ tabili kan.
That's good.	Iyẹn dara.
Remember to contact us with any questions.	Ranti lati kan si wa pẹlu eyikeyi ibeere.
His words, his power.	Ọrọ rẹ, agbara rẹ.
But there are more, of course.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii wa, dajudaju.
This city has many activities.	Ilu yi ni ọpọlọpọ awọn iṣẹ.
That means you need to stop.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe o nilo lati da.
He had met a girl.	O ti pade ọmọbirin kan.
Their parents stood behind.	Awọn obi wọn duro lẹhin.
We can't contact him, not yet.	A ko le kan si i, ko sibẹsibẹ.
This is where the problem lies.	Eyi ni ibi ti iṣoro naa wa.
Not sure how that will turn out.	Ko daju bi iyẹn yoo ṣe jade.
I feel my body has changed.	Mo lero pe ara mi yipada.
This is outside the box.	Eyi wa ni ita apoti.
He will walk at any time.	Oun yoo rin ni akoko kankan.
I have to come back to see you off.	Mo ni lati pada wa lati ri ọ pa.
One last thing.	Ohun kan ti o kẹhin.
I leave them to grow even if there is room.	Mo fi wọn silẹ lati dagba paapaa ti yara ba wa.
And, of course, he was very young.	Ati pe, dajudaju, o jẹ ọmọde pupọ.
What it looks like.	Ohun ti o dabi.
I wonder what is simple.	Mo Iyanu kini o rọrun.
These ideas do not help or want.	Awọn ero wọnyi ko ṣe iranlọwọ tabi fẹ.
Okay, that doesn’t make any sense.	O dara, iyẹn ko ṣe ori eyikeyi.
I asked myself.	Mo ti beere wipe ara mi.
He spends a lot of time.	O n lo akoko pupọ ju lọ.
There is no time to look at everything, just what is important.	Ko si akoko lati wo ohun gbogbo, o kan ohun ti o ṣe pataki.
He began to get used to working in a company.	O bẹrẹ lati lo lati ṣiṣẹ ni ile-iṣẹ kan.
They will be easy to find.	Wọn yoo rọrun lati rii.
There are two groups to it.	Awọn ẹgbẹ meji wa si i.
He can't even look me up.	Ko le paapaa wo mi soke.
He is a very beloved child.	O jẹ ọmọ ayanfẹ pupọ.
We must return.	A gbọdọ pada.
He did not expect their meeting to last that long.	O ko nireti pe ipade wọn yoo pẹ to yẹn.
I'll have to look inside.	Emi yoo ni lati wo inu rẹ.
Do you know what you are doing?	Ṣe o mọ ohun ti o n ṣe?
And happy about it.	Ati ki o dun nipa o.
But there are some.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu wọn wa.
The question is one you love.	Ibeere naa jẹ ọkan ti o nifẹ.
The more she thinks about it, the more she wonders.	Bi o ṣe n ronu nipa rẹ diẹ sii, iyalẹnu diẹ sii.
You may not even be at home if that happens.	O le paapaa ko ni ile ti iyẹn ba ṣẹlẹ.
The tea will help.	Tii naa yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.
How does this apply to you?	Bawo ni eyi ṣe kan ọ?
But after a while, he made it harder.	Ṣugbọn lẹhin igba diẹ, o mu u le.
Of course you have.	Dajudaju o ni.
But it's just not there anymore.	Sugbon o kan ko wa nibẹ mọ.
Everything just comes from trial and error.	Ohun gbogbo ti o kan wa lati idanwo ati aṣiṣe.
You almost like it.	O fẹrẹ fẹran rẹ.
It was the first thing he did.	O jẹ ohun akọkọ ti o ṣe.
The water is going down.	Omi ti n lọ ni isalẹ.
I hate feeling this way.	Mo korira rilara ọna yi.
The cats are not walking well.	Awọn ologbo naa ko rin daradara.
First, personal opinion.	Ni akọkọ, ero ti ara ẹni.
And it doesn't stay down.	Ati awọn ti o ko duro si isalẹ.
But only this table is not photographed.	Sugbon nikan yi tabili ti wa ni ko ni ya aworan.
But it is not over.	Ṣugbọn ko pari.
He returned to his wife, whom he had not seen in months.	O pada si ọdọ iyawo rẹ, ẹniti ko ri ni awọn oṣu.
We sold our car yesterday.	A ta ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wa lana.
Most of it is available in public.	Pupọ julọ rẹ wa ni gbangba ni agbegbe gbangba.
It felt less to me after that day.	O ro kere si mi lẹhin ọjọ yẹn.
Not much.	Kii ṣe pupọ.
The journey has many reasons.	Irin-ajo naa ni ọpọlọpọ awọn idi.
I feel your fire.	Mo lero ina rẹ.
I read at work.	Mo ka ni ibi iṣẹ.
The wife said they would help.	Iyawo sọ pe wọn yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.
I don't want to have anything to do with it.	Emi ko fẹ lati ni nkankan lati se pẹlu ti o.
I can't get more.	Emi ko le gba diẹ sii.
One of a kind.	Ọkan ninu iru kan.
But that work is finished.	Ṣugbọn iṣẹ yẹn pari.
Now we are friends.	Bayi a jẹ ọrẹ.
But he is not, perhaps.	Ṣugbọn oun kii ṣe iyẹn, boya.
Feel free to contact us with any questions you may have.	Lero lati kan si wa pẹlu eyikeyi ibeere ti o le ni.
I have learned to live with my position, especially work.	Mo ti kọ ẹkọ lati gbe pẹlu ipo mi, paapaa iṣẹ.
I'm just angry with him.	Mo kan binu si i.
We will think of something else.	A yoo ronu nkan miiran.
But that doesn’t make you wrong.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko jẹ ki o ṣe aṣiṣe.
Good idea to go to town.	Imọran to dara lati lọ si ilu.
There was a fire, he could not run.	Ina kan wa, ko le sare.
People forget this many times.	Awọn eniyan gbagbe eyi ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
Ask your brother for his opinion.	Beere ero arakunrin rẹ.
If you need something, you have to ask.	Ti o ba nilo nkankan, o ni sugbon lati beere.
I am becoming that person, the woman you are in love with.	Mo n di ẹni yẹn, obinrin ti o ni ifẹ pẹlu.
Which is not there.	Eyi ti ko si nibẹ.
None of this matters.	Ko si eyi ti o ṣe pataki.
Good for him, man.	O dara fun u, eniyan.
I heard, everyone listened.	Mo ti gbọ, gbogbo eniyan gbọ.
At home and test again and the key works.	Ni ile ati idanwo lẹẹkansi ati bọtini ṣiṣẹ.
There is no sense in it anymore.	Ko si ori kankan ninu rẹ mọ.
Even my father.	Paapaa baba mi.
Some of these were sold out last night.	Diẹ ninu awọn wọnyi ni a ta silẹ ni alẹ ana.
It’s how we do it.	O jẹ bi a ṣe ṣe.
I think it is possible.	Mo ro pe o ṣee ṣe.
It has to be a conclusion.	O ni lati jẹ ipari kan.
I can not tell you how to live your life.	Emi ko le sọ fun ọ bi o ṣe le gbe igbesi aye rẹ.
That's what they need.	Ohun ti wọn nilo niyẹn.
We have used three methods here.	A ti lo awọn ọna mẹta nibi.
Maybe we should go bath.	Boya o yẹ ki a lọ wẹ.
He knew his brother.	O mọ arakunrin rẹ.
I have written that.	Mo ti kọ iyẹn.
He made decisions there.	O ṣe awọn ipinnu nibẹ.
There is plenty to do here for all age groups.	Ọpọlọpọ wa lati ṣe nibi fun gbogbo ẹgbẹ ori.
I can't even see.	Emi ko le rii paapaa.
And they did that.	Ati pe wọn ṣe iyẹn.
Ask yourself this.	Beere lọwọ ararẹ eyi.
Everyone started talking.	Gbogbo eniyan bẹrẹ si sọrọ.
I do not like the person.	Emi ko fẹran eniyan naa.
I have not come home yet.	Emi ko tii wa si ile sibẹsibẹ.
They put themselves in that position, they can get themselves out.	Wọn fi ara wọn si ipo naa, wọn le gba ara wọn jade.
However perhaps it is correct.	Sibẹsibẹ boya o tọ.
Time for him to move on.	Akoko fun u lati gbe lori.
I try to make a house for you as much as you need.	Mo gbiyanju lati ṣe ile kan fun ọ bi o ṣe nilo.
I feel it comes from myself.	Mo lero pe o wa lati ara mi.
I think you may have hit him in the head.	Mo ro pe o le ti lu u ni ori.
A contract.	Iwe adehun kan.
They grew up together.	Wọn dagba papọ.
But it will not come.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo wa.
I tell you not to worry.	Mo sọ fun ọ pe ki o ma ṣe aniyan.
I don’t know why it will work but not less.	Ko mọ idi ti yoo ṣiṣẹ ṣugbọn kii ṣe kere si.
Only a matter of time.	Nikan ọrọ kan ti akoko.
It did not surprise me at all.	Ko ṣe ohun iyanu fun mi ni diẹ.
This is one of the first things you learn.	Eyi jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ohun akọkọ ti o kọ.
Many things you already believe are made to believe more.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun ti o gbagbọ tẹlẹ ni a jẹ ki o gbagbọ diẹ sii.
Such police should be removed from their positions.	Iru ọlọpa yẹ ki o yọ kuro ni awọn ipo wọn.
Or maybe there is something else you want to try.	Tabi boya nkan miiran wa ti o fẹ gbiyanju.
As it did the year before.	Bi o ti ṣe ni ọdun ṣaaju.
All girls will have a simple look.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọbirin yoo ni oju ti o rọrun.
Just everything.	O kan ohun gbogbo.
Everything is wrong, that is me.	Ohun gbogbo ti o jẹ aṣiṣe, iyẹn ni emi.
I think my parents are not at the wedding venue.	Mo ro pe awọn obi mi ko si ni ibi igbeyawo.
But that would be much easier.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn yoo rọrun pupọ.
Well, not at all.	O dara, kii ṣe lati ṣẹlẹ.
He was the last of its kind.	O jẹ ẹni ikẹhin ti iru rẹ.
And my mother.	Ati iya mi.
Mother and child do great. 	Iya ati ọmọ ṣe nla. 
Leave it and forget it.	Fi silẹ ki o gbagbe rẹ.
It looks like we will just lose ourselves.	O dabi pe a yoo kan padanu ara wa.
They have been tested.	Wọn ti ni idanwo.
I'll tell you when.	Emi yoo sọ fun ọ nigbawo.
You should ask, you know.	O yẹ ki o beere, o mọ.
They are thinking of opening a new restaurant in town.	Wọn n ronu lati ṣii ile ounjẹ tuntun ni ilu.
But this time the women were left behind.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yii a fi awọn obinrin silẹ.
But we have no information on the range.	Ṣugbọn a ko ni alaye lori ibiti o wa.
Tell your friends.	Sọ fun awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
It was their last chance.	O je wọn kẹhin anfani.
Just sitting together or holding hands can always say more than words.	Nikan joko papọ tabi di ọwọ mu le nigbagbogbo sọ diẹ sii ju awọn ọrọ lọ.
That sounds so simple, but it was not.	Ti o dun ki o rọrun, sugbon o je ko.
You have no money for a house.	O ko ni owo fun ile kan.
People understand this well.	Awọn eniyan loye eyi daradara.
We were there.	A ti wa nibẹ.
I'll see.	Emi yoo rii.
You can benefit me now.	O le ni anfani fun mi ni bayi.
All tests were performed three times.	Gbogbo awọn idanwo ni a ṣe ni igba mẹta.
I have not seen him for a few days.	Emi ko tii ri i fun awọn ọjọ diẹ.
If possible, you know, people would do it.	Ti o ba ṣee ṣe, o mọ, eniyan yoo ṣe.
I think you must have known.	Mo ro pe o gbọdọ ti mọ.
Before you speak, first think.	Ṣaaju ki o to sọrọ, akọkọ ro.
How do you keep your stuff together in the following.	Bawo ni o ṣe tọju nkan rẹ papọ ninu awọn wọnyi.
I never killed anything.	Emi ko pa nkan rara.
Let's look at this.	Jẹ ká wo ni yi.
We performed two types of tests.	A ṣe awọn iru idanwo meji.
It is your time.	O jẹ akoko rẹ.
This time you have the best stuff in store.	Ni akoko yii o ni nkan ti o dara julọ ni ile itaja.
As we know what this world is all about.	Bi a ti mọ kini ile aye yii jẹ gbogbo nipa.
You never know when your last game will be.	Iwọ ko mọ igba ti ere ọjọ ikẹhin rẹ yoo jẹ.
Books will pick up, and we will eat.	Awọn iwe yoo gbe soke, ati pe a yoo jẹ.
We can all do that, or something like that.	Gbogbo wa le ṣe iyẹn, tabi nkankan bii rẹ.
Cannot have both.	Ko le ni awọn mejeeji.
Put it on.	Gbe e lori.
I can tell from their eyes.	Mo le sọ lati oju wọn.
I do not need that now.	Emi ko nilo iyẹn ni bayi.
I want to read a book.	Mo fe ka iwe kan.
You missed it.	O padanu rẹ.
Her brother also applies.	Arakunrin rẹ tun kan.
He was through.	O si wà nipasẹ.
The driver should not have taken them, but he did.	Awakọ naa ko yẹ ki o gba wọn, ṣugbọn o ṣe.
These devices	Awọn ẹrọ wọnyi
So you can try to play around a little bit.	Nitorina o le gbiyanju lati mu ṣiṣẹ ni ayika diẹ diẹ.
Whatever is wrong, we will talk about it.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ aṣiṣe, a yoo sọrọ nipa rẹ.
But it can also be used for other purposes.	Ṣugbọn o tun le lo fun awọn idi miiran.
You will give birth to a son.	Iwọ yoo bi ọmọkunrin kan.
Just make her happy.	O kan jẹ ki inu rẹ dun.
Her parents are here.	Awọn obi rẹ wa nibi.
They can last a long time, but not forever.	Wọn le duro fun igba pipẹ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe lailai.
I mean.	Mo tumọ si pe.
You are not my father.	Iwọ kii ṣe baba mi.
I can get it.	Mo le gba.
They are too scared to say anything.	Wọn bẹru pupọ lati sọ ohunkohun.
It's your time to talk.	O jẹ akoko rẹ lati sọrọ.
The body of the slain woman was found.	Ara obinrin ti a pa ni a ri.
You need a contract to get started.	O nilo adehun lati bẹrẹ.
I can't wait for him.	Emi ko le duro fun u.
He is no longer a child.	Ko si jẹ ọmọ mọ.
Will come get them.	Yoo wa gba wọn.
Surprisingly, it doesn’t get me like that.	Iyalẹnu, ko gba mi bi iyẹn.
I just took him and took him.	Mo ti o kan mu u ati ki o mu u.
He will not need them.	Oun kii yoo nilo wọn.
It has changed for him.	O ti yipada fun u.
If only you could think.	Ti o ba le ronu nikan.
Above all, important.	Ju gbogbo rẹ lọ, pataki.
Enjoy the night and be married.	Gbadun alẹ ati ki o wa ni iyawo.
I do not have to wait to see my sister.	Emi ko ni lati duro lati ri arabinrin mi.
That makes you think.	Iyẹn jẹ ki o ronu.
But some of them stay away.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu wọn duro kuro.
Made of metal.	Ṣe ti irin.
Some just read the book.	Diẹ ninu awọn kan ka iwe.
He thought I was a professional.	O ni ero mi jẹ iṣẹ kan.
Back to summer.	Pada si ooru.
This may sound like bad information, but that's how it feels.	Eyi le dun bi alaye ti ko dara, ṣugbọn iyẹn ni bi o ṣe rilara.
He did not want to.	Ko fẹ.
I do not have time for such things.	Emi ko ni akoko fun iru awọn nkan bẹẹ.
It doesn't seem to be working.	Ko dabi pe o n ṣiṣẹ.
Bad city.	Ilu buburu.
Anything could happen.	Ohunkohun le ṣẹlẹ.
Everyone will love to know.	Gbogbo eniyan yoo nifẹ lati mọ.
Much can be learned from this book.	Pupọ ni a le kọ lati inu iwe yii.
How is it possible.	Bawo ni o ṣe ṣee ṣe.
It is the essence of the idea.	O jẹ ero ti ero naa.
I can't come back from this.	Emi ko le pada wa lati eyi.
It happened at a party meeting.	O ṣẹlẹ ni ipade ti ẹgbẹ kan.
It’s just that you’re at home.	O kan jẹ pe o wa ni ile.
What we say now cannot bring them back to life.	Ohun ti a sọ ni bayi ko le mu wọn pada si aye.
That world is gone, changed forever.	Aye yẹn ti lọ, ti yipada lailai.
I did not explain to him exactly what he saw.	Emi ko ṣe alaye fun u ni otitọ ohun ti o rii.
Those who need it will not find it.	Awọn ti o nilo rẹ kii yoo rii.
He arrived on time.	O de ni akoko.
I am convinced.	Mo da mi loju.
I don't really want anything.	Emi ko fẹ nkankan gaan.
He will do in two days what it takes you in three years.	Oun yoo ṣe ni ọjọ meji kan ohun ti o gba ọ ni ọdun mẹta.
This should not be too surprising.	Eyi ko yẹ ki o jẹ iyalẹnu pupọ.
Make sure you have proper nutrition.	Rii daju pe o ni ounjẹ to dara.
That was really amazing.	Iyẹn jẹ iyalẹnu gaan.
The terms of this agreement are final.	Awọn ofin ti adehun yii jẹ ipari.
He could not be convinced.	Ko le ni idaniloju.
His only love will be in their kind.	Ifẹ rẹ nikan ni yoo jẹ ninu iru wọn.
There are two known reasons.	Nibẹ ni o wa meji mọ idi.
The company has not yet received the money back.	Ile-iṣẹ naa ko tii gba owo naa pada sibẹsibẹ.
I can find water.	Mo ti le ri omi.
That is by day.	Iyẹn jẹ nipasẹ ọjọ.
It's too small.	O ti kere ju.
But things are not going to stay that way for long.	Ṣugbọn awọn nkan ko fẹrẹ duro ni ọna yẹn fun pipẹ.
I don’t even know it.	Emi ko paapaa mọ ọ.
Many parents are worried about their children.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn obi ni aniyan nipa awọn ọmọ wọn.
It was everything to him.	O je ohun gbogbo fun u.
We agree.	A gba.
I love your music, he said.	Mo fẹran orin rẹ, o sọ.
Do try and accept.	Ṣe o gbiyanju ati gba.
No group said it carried them out.	Ko si ẹgbẹ ti o sọ pe o gbe wọn jade.
It is perhaps the last time.	O ti wa ni boya awọn ti o kẹhin akoko.
Or not die, in any case.	Tabi ko ku, ni eyikeyi nla.
He was on his own.	O si wà lori ara rẹ.
I can't just hear that.	Emi ko le kan gbọ iyẹn.
Maybe for money.	Boya fun owo.
You can’t hate that.	O ko le korira iyẹn.
If you want.	Ti o ba fẹ.
It has been going on for a long time.	O ti lọ fun igba pipẹ.
'of'.	'ti'.
You will not want to miss this.	Iwọ kii yoo fẹ lati padanu eyi.
Well after last night, things changed a little bit.	O dara lẹhin alẹ ana, awọn nkan yipada pupọ diẹ.
He didn't seem to eat at all.	O dabi enipe ko jẹun rara.
She had a drink and all her worries went away.	O ni ohun mimu ati gbogbo awọn iṣoro rẹ lọ kuro.
He will make a good company.	Oun yoo ṣe ile-iṣẹ ti o dara.
He will lose.	Oun yoo padanu.
He doesn’t know how to handle things.	Oun ko mọ bi o ṣe le mu awọn nkan wa.
Now you have my attention.	Bayi o ni akiyesi mi.
Water is afraid of him.	Omi ni o bẹru rẹ.
This is something we have to do.	Eyi jẹ nkan ti a ni lati ṣe.
You can touch it if you want.	O le fi ọwọ kan rẹ ti o ba fẹ.
No one, of course, can explain any of it.	Ko si ẹnikan, dajudaju, ti o le ṣe alaye eyikeyi ninu rẹ.
She is wearing her clothes.	O ti wọ aṣọ rẹ.
And at least one of them will break.	Ati pe o kere ju ọkan ninu wọn yoo fọ.
Works very well.	Ṣiṣẹ gan daradara.
At least until they heard his name.	O kere titi ti wọn fi gbọ orukọ rẹ.
A picture would not have helped.	Aworan kan kii yoo ti ṣe iranlọwọ.
It's done, sleep out.	O ti ṣe, sun jade.
That is another story.	Iyẹn jẹ itan miiran.
That is for dinner only.	Iyẹn jẹ fun ounjẹ alẹ kan nikan.
Well a man can be.	Daradara ọkunrin kan le jẹ.
They can be picked up in the next two days.	Wọn le mu ni awọn ọjọ meji ti nbọ.
But this situation is what it is.	Ṣugbọn ipo yii jẹ ohun ti o jẹ.
That's how bad it is.	Bi o ṣe jẹ buburu niyẹn.
Maybe a little more will.	Boya pupọ diẹ yoo.
I just have to be convinced.	Mo kan ni lati ni idaniloju.
As expected.	Bi o ti reti.
I don't think so.	Emi ko ronu iyẹn.
I do.	Mo tun ṣe.
Again, no matter the point.	Lẹẹkansi, ko ṣe pataki aaye wo.
You must have done them.	O gbọdọ ti ṣe wọn.
I absolutely love it.	Mo nifẹ rẹ patapata.
Without a word, they left.	Laisi ọrọ kan, wọn lọ kuro.
Let him hear.	Jẹ ki o gbọ.
The film itself does not tell the story.	Aworan funrararẹ ko sọ itan naa.
Enough about me.	To nipa mi.
Now the house is gone.	Bayi ile ko si si.
It just means.	O kan tumọ si.
Soon he hopes to leave.	Laipẹ o nireti lati lọ kuro.
Exit! 	Jade!
He is the best of us all.	Oun lo dara ju gbogbo wa lo.
They have been here for three years.	Wọn ti wa nibi fun ọdun mẹta.
He saw power in the name.	O ri agbara ni orukọ.
Let me know if that sounds good with you.	Jẹ ki n mọ boya iyẹn dara pẹlu rẹ.
I get a serious reason.	Mo gba idi ti o ṣe pataki.
The first point is given.	Aaye akọkọ ti a fun ni.
There is no perfect way.	Ko si ọna ti o pe.
If you do not know, you must have slept at the meeting.	Ti o ko ba mọ, o gbọdọ ti sun ni ipade.
It's just amazing.	O kan jẹ iyanu.
He sent money to his family, outside the city.	O fi owo ranṣẹ si idile rẹ, ni ita ilu.
They will have all the equipment you need.	Wọn yoo ni gbogbo awọn ohun elo ti o nilo.
I know there are members who have questions.	Mo mọ pe awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ wa ti o ni awọn ibeere.
Please use common sense before getting angry.	Jọwọ lo ọgbọn ọgbọn ṣaaju ki o to binu.
Not good for the baby.	Ko dara fun ọmọ naa.
I know they will enjoy this.	Mo mọ pe wọn yoo gbadun eyi.
The brother is fine.	Arakunrin naa dara.
You need to be alone.	O nilo lati wa nikan.
We became here again.	A tun di ibi.
No one of our age is into it.	Ko si ẹnikan ti ọjọ ori wa sinu rẹ.
Stay in them.	Duro ninu wọn.
People don't really have a look.	Eniyan ko gan ni kan wo.
These people are important.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi ṣe pataki.
You can sell items.	O le ta awọn ohun kan.
I agree with this idea.	Mo gba pẹlu ero yii.
It says nothing about the two of you.	O ko so ohunkohun nipa ti o meji.
The only rule is that there are no rules.	Ofin nikan ni pe ko si awọn ofin.
The weather, however, is good.	Oju ojo, sibẹsibẹ, dara.
Now they have a chance to get into these girls.	Bayi wọn ni aye lati gba sinu awọn ọmọbirin wọnyi.
You can understand them.	O le loye wọn.
Have you ever been to this city?	Njẹ o ti lọ si ilu yii ri?
I have said it many times.	Mo ti sọ ọ ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
It doesn't matter that way.	Ko ṣe pataki ni ọna yẹn.
He was a bad man in many ways.	O jẹ eniyan buburu ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna.
It's a very interesting place.	O ni a gan awon ibi.
They all want to know how this story will go.	Gbogbo wọn fẹ lati mọ bi itan yii yoo ṣe lọ.
She had known the man for a long time.	O ti mọ ọkunrin naa fun igba pipẹ.
You may want to wash your hands.	O le fẹ lati wẹ ọwọ rẹ.
No one laughed.	Ko si ẹniti o ti rẹrin.
Try to get it into their head as it works.	Gbiyanju lati gba o sinu ori wọn bi o ti ṣiṣẹ.
Not that he would tell her that.	Kii ṣe pe oun yoo sọ fun u pe.
That’s what we believe and we want to know.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti a gbagbọ ati pe a fẹ ki a mọ.
I can still go without notice.	Mo tun le lọ laisi akiyesi.
I really decided that.	Mo pinnu gaan pe.
So you have to be dead.	Nitorina o ni lati ti ku.
Sorry to hear that.	Ma binu lati gbọ iyẹn.
Sometimes the best deal is to be honest.	Nigba miiran adehun ti o dara dara ju lati jẹ otitọ.
For me, this is the time.	Fun mi, eyi ni akoko naa.
My children will not leave me.	Awọn ọmọ mi kii yoo fi mi silẹ.
I use them for that purpose.	Mo lo wọn fun idi yẹn.
Life goes where it goes.	Igbesi aye n lọ si ibi ti o lọ.
None of the top three teams.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ẹgbẹ mẹta ti o ga julọ.
And around everyone.	Ati ni ayika gbogbo eniyan.
He worked until the wee hours of the morning.	O ṣiṣẹ titi di awọn wakati kekere ti owurọ.
He came back, could not do another.	O pada, ko le ṣe miiran.
First let him think of his father.	Akọkọ jẹ ki o le ronu ti baba rẹ.
I have to walk in and out.	Mo ni lati rin ni ki o si jade.
Do one, you will find love one day.	Ṣe ọkan, iwọ yoo rii ifẹ ni ọjọ kan.
It’s as simple as that.	O rọrun bi iyẹn.
Everyone around you knows.	Gbogbo eniyan ni ayika ni o mọ.
Let’s just leave now.	Jẹ ki a kan lọ kuro ni bayi.
Or maybe you will.	Tabi boya o yoo.
It can be done.	O le ṣee ṣe.
Can't help right now.	Ko le ṣe iranlọwọ ni bayi.
Water is the key.	Omi ni bọtini.
It was the first time he had done so.	O jẹ igba akọkọ ti o ṣe bẹ.
That made it my time.	Iyẹn jẹ ki o jẹ akoko mi.
They are no longer in a position.	Wọn ko ni ipo mọ.
None of us.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa.
You look towards the main doors.	O wo si ọna awọn ilẹkun akọkọ.
It works great.	O ṣiṣẹ nla.
But you have a lot of time to do a lot.	Ṣugbọn o ni akoko pupọ lati ṣe pupọ.
These are good things.	Awọn nkan to dara ni wọnyi.
And it’s not just one, it’s been the first.	Ati pe kii ṣe ọkan nikan, o ti jẹ akọkọ.
A few students completed the exam on time.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe diẹ ti pari idanwo ni akoko.
They were out on the road again last week.	Wọn tun jade ni opopona lẹẹkansi ni ọsẹ to kọja.
It seemed more appropriate.	O dabi enipe diẹ ti o yẹ.
I will repeat them, he thought.	Emi yoo tun wọn ṣe, o ro.
That makes me happy.	Iyẹn jẹ ki inu mi dun.
Of course you do.	Dajudaju o ṣe.
They are gone.	Wọn ti lọ silẹ.
He could not carry such a thing for a long time.	Ko le gbe iru nkan bẹẹ fun igba pipẹ.
Her teacher spoke again.	Olukọ rẹ sọrọ lẹẹkansi.
Holiday camp for school teachers?	Ibudo isinmi fun awọn olukọ ile-iwe?
City planning is a thing of the past.	Eto ilu jẹ ohun ti o ti kọja.
Don't be too late.	Maṣe pẹ ju.
They will not miss a meal.	Wọn kii yoo padanu ounjẹ kan.
You never know how long it will last.	O ko mọ bi o gun o duro nibẹ.
He holds hands.	O di ọwọ mu.
He is enjoying his little game.	O n gbadun ere kekere rẹ.
Leaving home.	Ti lọ kuro ni ile.
I love her enough to give her time to change her mind.	Mo nifẹ rẹ to lati fun u ni akoko lati yi ọkan rẹ pada.
Road up always high.	Opopona soke nigbagbogbo ga.
However, most people are not aware of its benefits.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan ko mọ nipa awọn anfani rẹ.
I read something in the newspaper today.	Mo ka nkan kan ninu iwe iroyin loni.
Even that would be really hard.	Paapaa iyẹn yoo jẹ lile gaan.
The law should bring us.	Ofin naa yẹ ki o mu wa.
It's outside, just down the road.	O wa ni ita, o kan ni opopona.
Two minutes is two minutes.	Iṣẹju meji jẹ iṣẹju meji.
I have a feeling that something you are interested in is building up.	Mo ni rilara pe nkan ti o nifẹ si n kọ soke.
You can see.	O le rii.
They are younger than we are.	Wọn jẹ ọdọ ju wa lọ.
She hates wearing shoes.	O korira wọ awon bata.
You hear what I say all the time.	O gbọ ti mo sọ ni gbogbo igba.
It was months before.	O jẹ awọn oṣu ṣaaju.
Things on me.	Awọn nkan lori mi.
This is the information age.	Eyi ni ọjọ ori alaye.
I doubt that.	Mo ṣiyemeji iyẹn.
I have been my own passion and desire.	Mo ti wa ti ara mi ifẹ ati ifẹ.
I have never lived before.	Emi ko ni aye ṣaaju ki o to.
Teachers and parents must work together.	Awọn olukọ ati awọn obi gbọdọ ṣiṣẹ papọ.
Two groups of two.	Awọn ẹgbẹ meji ti meji.
I don't know yet.	Emi ko tii mọ.
We have the best schools.	A ni awọn ile-iwe ti o dara julọ.
Your goal is to get out alone.	Ero rẹ ni lati jade nikan.
I know that for the truth.	Mo mọ pe fun otitọ.
This is a great way to spend a morning.	Eyi jẹ ọna nla lati lo owurọ kan.
But he did.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe.
You just have to try your best when you sing.	O kan ni lati gbiyanju ohun ti o dara julọ nigbati o ba kọ orin.
You have done very well.	O ti ṣe daradara pupọ.
Every day, with all the love and energy we have.	Ni gbogbo ọjọ, pẹlu gbogbo ifẹ ati agbara ti a ni.
Any help? 	Eyikeyi iranlọwọ?
In a word, you have put the box inside.	Ninu ọrọ kan, o ti fi apoti sinu.
We don't need to help you anymore.	A ko nilo lati ran ọ lọwọ mọ.
Go read it.	Lọ ka o.
Those benefits have continued in the new year.	Awọn anfani yẹn ti tẹsiwaju ni ọdun tuntun.
You want to save that time.	O fẹ lati tọju akoko naa.
It just doesn’t work for me.	O kan ko ṣe fun mi.
And it is important.	Ati pe o ṣe pataki.
Some really good ideas.	Diẹ ninu awọn gan ti o dara ero.
I tried for a very long time.	Mo gbiyanju fun igba pipẹ pupọ.
No one likes to leave us alone, especially me.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o nifẹ lati fi wa silẹ nikan, paapaa emi.
He did his job.	O ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
I walked back across the rooms.	Mo rin pada kọja awọn yara.
Not after what just happened.	Ko lẹhin ohun ti o kan ṣẹlẹ.
Running is not something you do.	Ṣiṣe lọ kii ṣe nkan ti o ṣe.
The first is family.	Akọkọ jẹ idile.
He came to life with the first light of the morning.	O wa si igbesi aye pẹlu ina akọkọ ti owurọ.
But that stopped two years ago.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn duro ni ọdun meji sẹhin.
You have ideas, he said.	O ni awọn ero, o sọ.
And this would be, in fact, completely good.	Ati pe eyi yoo jẹ, ni otitọ, dara patapata.
Okay, so maybe not.	O dara, nitorina boya kii ṣe.
Don't ask everyone to help you with your problem.	Maṣe beere lọwọ gbogbo eniyan lati ran ọ lọwọ pẹlu iṣoro rẹ.
The sister was beautiful as she remembered.	Arabinrin naa lẹwa bi o ti ranti.
Now is the time.	Ni bayi ni akoko yii.
But his wife hated him here.	Ṣugbọn iyawo rẹ korira rẹ nibi.
I am here specifically.	Mo wa nibi pataki.
So, what is wrong with it?	Nitorina, kini o jẹ aṣiṣe pẹlu rẹ?
But take this with the right diet, and stay back.	Ṣugbọn gba eyi pẹlu ounjẹ to tọ, ki o duro sẹhin.
You would have said no.	O yoo ti sọ rara.
The abandoned house stands on the road.	Ile ti a kọ silẹ duro ni opopona.
It looks great.	O dabi nla.
I don’t see anyone behind it.	Emi ko ri enikeni lẹhin rẹ.
I just look at them.	Mo kan wo wọn.
It needs space for testing and operation.	O nilo agbegbe fun idanwo ati ṣiṣẹ.
However, only two have been released.	Sibẹsibẹ, meji nikan ni a ti gbe jade.
It is a very important question.	O jẹ ibeere pataki pupọ.
You have to play first.	O ni lati mu akọkọ.
When will that life begin again?	Nigbawo ni igbesi aye yẹn yoo tun bẹrẹ?
You read these words and understand what happens.	O ka ọrọ wọnyi ati oye ṣẹlẹ.
That was some of the best moments.	Iyẹn jẹ diẹ ninu awọn akoko ti o dara julọ.
There is a child under these conditions.	Ọmọde kan wa labẹ awọn ipo wọnyi.
I let you have your way.	Mo jẹ ki o ni ọna rẹ.
You can read that story here.	O le ka itan yẹn nibi.
I doubt that much.	Mo ṣiyemeji iyẹn pupọ.
Did your mother teach you to cook?	Njẹ iya rẹ kọ ọ lati ṣe ounjẹ?
This statement has already been made.	A ti sọ ọrọ yii tẹlẹ.
Two young men meet on a train and fall in love.	Awọn ọdọ meji pade lori ọkọ oju irin kan wọn si ni ifẹ.
Can't help.	Ko le ṣe iranlọwọ.
It always tired me in the morning.	Nigbagbogbo o rẹ mi ni owurọ.
Once you have, you have.	Ni kete ti o ba ni, o ni.
Doctors hate it.	Awọn dokita korira rẹ.
So many games.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ awọn ere.
Everyone ate.	Gbogbo eniyan jẹun.
Everything was the same.	Ohun gbogbo wà kanna.
Tonight, there will be fireworks.	Ni alẹ ọla, awọn iṣẹ ina yoo wa.
She is very angry.	O binu pupọ.
No time.	Ko si akoko.
Many love it.	Ọpọlọpọ fẹran rẹ.
You can give the picture to your sister.	O le fi aworan naa fun arabinrin rẹ.
He was here a few minutes ago.	O wa nibi ni iṣẹju diẹ sẹhin.
You need your time to be young.	O nilo akoko rẹ lati jẹ ọmọde.
Another time and it will be too late.	Akoko miiran ati pe yoo pẹ ju.
Is not much of a family.	Ṣe kii ṣe pupọ ti idile.
Most of them are jobs.	Pupọ ninu wọn jẹ awọn iṣẹ.
I should have, and I was happy.	Mo yẹ ki o jẹ, ati pe inu mi dun.
He did not try to find out what happened.	Ko gbiyanju lati wa ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
There is something about it.	Nkankan wa nipa rẹ.
These are things like, or.	Awọn wọnyi ni ohun bi, tabi.
Last time for you.	Igba ikẹhin fun ọ.
It's too late now.	O ti pẹ ju bayi.
I think you can repeat.	Mo ro pe o le tun.
He can never say.	Ko le sọ lailai.
The same people.	Awọn eniyan kanna.
I would like to understand it.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ni oye rẹ.
It is given.	O ti fun ni.
If you take enough time, it will be great.	Ti o ba gba akoko ti o to, yoo jẹ nla.
In a few days, it will arrive.	Ni awọn ọjọ diẹ, yoo de ibi.
I wanted to make her laugh.	Mo fe lati ṣe rẹ rẹrin.
He will do whatever you ask.	Oun yoo ṣe nipa ohunkohun ti o beere.
His mother always talked about his beautiful wife.	Iya rẹ nigbagbogbo sọrọ nipa iyawo rẹ ti o dara julọ.
I'm stuck here.	Mo di nibi.
He woke up at night and could not wait for the morning.	O ji ni alẹ ko si le duro fun owurọ.
You can also start here.	O tun le bẹrẹ nibi.
All kinds of things.	Gbogbo iru nkan.
He is married and has children.	O ni iyawo ati ọmọ.
We walked like this down the road.	A rin bi eleyi si isalẹ opopona.
I have done a lot of things with it in the last few weeks.	Mo ti ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan pẹlu rẹ ni awọn ọsẹ diẹ sẹhin.
You must try it.	O gbọdọ gbiyanju o.
I give you something good to think about.	Mo fun ọ ni nkan ti o dara lati ronu nipa.
This was really good.	Eleyi je gan ti o dara.
You have a limited time.	O ni akoko to kan.
I can't seem to remember his name.	Emi ko le dabi lati ranti orukọ rẹ.
But he is stolen.	Sugbon o ti wa ni ji.
People do this.	Eniyan ṣe eyi.
It depends on who you ask.	O da lori ẹniti o beere.
There is so much to do,	Pupọ wa lati ṣe,
Only, there you are.	Nikan, nibẹ o wa.
Good things to do, like this issue.	Awọn nkan to dara julọ lati ṣe, bii ọrọ yii.
Both.	Awon mejeeji.
At the very least we do.	O kere pupọ julọ wa ṣe.
Well, of course not.	Daradara, dajudaju ko.
The world is a water world.	Aye jẹ aye omi.
Not a man, not growing up.	Ko ọkunrin kan, ko dagba.
I am sure my parents lost me but they understood.	Mo da mi loju pe awon obi mi padanu mi sugbon won loye.
Not sure how you should feel about this report.	Ko mọ bi o ṣe yẹ ki o lero nipa iroyin yii.
Children learn to walk	Awọn ọmọde kọ ẹkọ lati rin
I love that stuff.	Mo nifẹ nkan naa.
I hope to come back but when is the question.	Mo nireti lati pada ṣugbọn nigbawo ni ibeere naa.
I could be wrong about that.	Mo le jẹ aṣiṣe nipa eyi.
He could not think what to say.	Ko le ronu ohun ti yoo sọ.
We should stay together.	A yẹ ki o duro papọ.
But do not forget.	Sugbon ko gbagbe.
That was the best time of the day.	Iyẹn jẹ akoko ti o dara julọ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
There is nothing in sight.	Ko si nkankan ni oju.
He will not tell me.	Ko ni so fun mi.
I can't think of anything to say.	Emi ko le ronu ohun kan lati sọ.
But we stay here.	Sugbon a duro nibi.
It was interesting.	O je awon.
That would be another book.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ iwe miiran.
This is an important issue.	Eyi jẹ ọrọ pataki kan.
Do not forget to clean your desk.	Maṣe gbagbe lati nu tabili rẹ kuro.
He also has a daughter.	O tun ni ọmọbirin kan.
Everything should work now.	Ohun gbogbo yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ ni bayi.
He began to reach her.	O bẹrẹ lati de ọdọ rẹ.
Here is the problem.	Nibi wahala ba wa.
However, we can work on that.	Sibẹsibẹ, a le ṣiṣẹ lori iyẹn.
He believes this problem will be gone.	O gbagbọ pe iṣoro yii yoo ti lọ.
Hands, he thought.	Ọwọ, o ro.
The sun has set.	Oorun ti wọ.
It's great.	O dara julọ.
Come here first.	Wa nibi akọkọ.
Your games can be found everywhere.	Awọn ere rẹ ni a le rii nibi gbogbo.
If not, write them down.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, kọ wọn.
Now that you think about it.	Bayi wipe o ro nipa o.
Take local advice seriously.	Gba imọran agbegbe ni pataki.
There are two reasons for this.	Awọn idi meji lo wa fun eyi.
He sent me to help.	O ran mi lati ran.
Or higher, you might like.	Tabi ga julọ, o le fẹ.
It gives nothing away.	O yoo fun ohunkohun kuro.
Tell them what they need to know, not what you know.	Sọ fun wọn ohun ti wọn nilo lati mọ, kii ṣe ohun ti o mọ.
He is in his family.	O wa ninu idile rẹ.
So the train arrived late.	Nitorina ọkọ oju irin de pẹ.
It's human.	Eniyan ni.
It taught me a lot.	O kọ mi pupọ.
As it turned out, he convinced himself.	Bi yoo ṣe ṣẹlẹ niyẹn, o da ara rẹ loju.
You can, hard, hard.	O le, lile, lile.
They have nothing to change.	Wọn ko ni nkankan lati yipada.
It does not work.	Ko ni ise.
He is the face of the father of the children now growing up.	O jẹ oju ti baba awọn ọmọ ti o dagba ni bayi.
We just continue to live our lives.	A kan tẹsiwaju lati gbe igbesi aye wa.
We know you're wrong.	A mọ pe o ṣe aṣiṣe.
You can always ask to keep this question open.	O le beere nigbagbogbo lati jẹ ki ibeere yii ṣii.
I love it but I don’t know what to do.	Mo nifẹ rẹ ṣugbọn emi ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
Friends must stand by friends.	Awọn ọrẹ gbọdọ duro nipasẹ awọn ọrẹ.
Water is the most important of the nutrients.	Omi jẹ pataki julọ ti awọn ounjẹ.
The whole story is in the first person.	Gbogbo itan wa ni eniyan akọkọ.
I need time to think about it.	Mo nilo akoko lati ronu nipa rẹ.
I want to be by your side forever.	Mo fẹ lati wa ni ẹgbẹ rẹ lailai.
You must wait.	O gbọdọ duro.
But don’t ask him about that.	Ṣugbọn maṣe beere lọwọ rẹ nipa iyẹn.
It has been going on for a long time.	O ti lọ fun igba pipẹ.
The same amount applies to the same people every month.	Awọn iye kanna si awọn eniyan kanna ni gbogbo oṣu.
They live here.	Won n gbe nibi.
It starts to put a few good players there.	Ti o ba bẹrẹ lati fi kan diẹ ti o dara awọn ẹrọ orin nibẹ.
From everyone, all of you.	Lati ọdọ gbogbo eniyan, gbogbo yin.
Think of a child.	Ronu ti ọmọ.
It does not appear to be.	O ko han lati wa ni.
You’ve seen it all your life, in fact.	O ti rii ni gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ, ni otitọ.
I will not let you do this.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki o ṣe eyi.
I just want to see something, anything, happen.	Mo kan fẹ lati rii nkankan, ohunkohun, ṣẹlẹ.
I need to have everyone understand and hear that.	Mo nilo lati ni gbogbo eniyan lati ni oye ati gbọ iyẹn.
I enjoy, there are kids my age.	Mo gbadun, awọn ọmọde ti ọjọ ori mi wa.
I wish you could see the information.	Mo fẹ pe o le rii alaye naa.
I will keep more of an eye on things.	Emi yoo tọju diẹ sii ti oju lori awọn nkan.
The company is located on the edge of town.	Ile-iṣẹ naa wa ni eti ilu.
Let's see how.	Jẹ ki a wo bii.
You are not the only one.	Iwọ kii ṣe ọkan nikan.
I believe a lot in this group.	Mo gbagbọ pupọ ninu ẹgbẹ yii.
Say you like those two things.	Sọ pe o fẹ awọn nkan meji yẹn.
It is not enough to just have a beautiful body.	Ko to lati ni ara lẹwa nikan.
He has done everything.	O ti ṣe ohun gbogbo.
No cars passed.	Ko si awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o kọja.
You can fly again.	O le fo lẹẹkansi.
It's over.	O kọja.
Find some you want to test drive them.	Wa diẹ ti o fẹ ki o ṣe idanwo wakọ wọn.
There will be more.	Diẹ ti o wa nibẹ yoo jẹ.
I know we have no chance.	Mo mọ pe a ko ni anfani.
They sell food here.	Wọn ta ounjẹ nibi.
You are not alone in this.	Iwọ kii ṣe nikan ni eyi.
It is the work of two people.	O jẹ iṣẹ eniyan meji.
Not just given, but what it really is.	Ko o kan ti o a fi fun, ṣugbọn ohun ti o jẹ gan.
What you want to plan, that will suffice.	Ohun ti o fẹ gbero, ti yoo ti to.
I have no money.	Emi ko ni owo.
Go get them !.	Lọ gba wọn!.
I am very confident this time it will stay.	Mo ni idaniloju pupọ ni akoko yii o yoo duro.
I always sleep there.	Mo nigbagbogbo sun nibẹ.
Whatever happens, raise your head.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ, gbe ori rẹ soke.
You do not have to ask.	O ko ni lati beere.
It is about power and money.	O jẹ nipa agbara ati owo.
But people make them miss some pictures.	Ṣugbọn eniyan ṣe wọn padanu diẹ ninu awọn aworan.
They do not see the future after graduation.	Wọn ko rii ọjọ iwaju lẹhin ipari ile-iwe.
He did not decide to say anything.	O ko pinnu lati sọ ohunkohun.
You just have to know it.	O kan ni lati mọ ọ.
I know you know.	Mo mọ pe o mọ.
He did not know what to say.	Ko mọ ohun ti yoo sọ.
The sister is fine.	Arabinrin naa dara.
You know we don’t have that.	O mọ pe a ko ni iyẹn.
Just go ahead.	O kan tẹsiwaju.
Now it is gone.	Bayi o ti lọ.
It seems to me that they know we are here.	O dabi fun mi pe wọn mọ pe a wa nibi.
I have a reason now, a job to do.	Mo ni idi kan ni bayi, iṣẹ kan lati ṣe.
It is yourself.	O jẹ funrararẹ.
She was afraid of these rooms.	O bẹru awọn yara wọnyi.
I find they love to play this.	Mo rii pe wọn nifẹ lati mu eyi.
You’re right, same person.	O tọ, eniyan kanna.
You have to get up.	O ni lati dide.
It made me forget.	O je ki n gbagbe.
In fact, it can be even easier.	Ni otitọ, o le paapaa rọrun.
And what about all the other things they do.	Ati kini gbogbo ohun miiran ti wọn ṣe.
When he left, we went.	Nigbati o ba lọ, a lọ.
We left the next day.	A ya kuro ni ọjọ kan lẹhin.
Money can buy anything.	Owo le ra ohunkohun.
I consider it important for the first time.	Mo ṣe akiyesi rẹ ni pataki fun igba akọkọ.
You do not want to.	Iwọ ko fẹ.
Only from non-humans.	Nikan lati awọn ti kii ṣe eniyan.
You have it.	O ni o.
I haven't seen him in a while.	Emi ko tii ri i fun igba diẹ.
You do not have to.	O ko ni lati.
Near, and yet it was not possible for him to drink.	Nitosi, ati sibẹsibẹ ko ṣee ṣe fun u lati mu.
They are on the way.	Wọn wa loju ọna.
I have this works great.	Mo ni eyi ṣiṣẹ nla.
And the baby.	Ati ọmọ naa.
And we are selling where we can.	Ati pe a n ta ni ibi ti a le.
There can be several methods in a class.	Awọn ọna pupọ le wa ninu kilasi kan.
So the words themselves are important.	Nitorina awọn ọrọ funrararẹ ṣe pataki.
And he didn't really want to be him.	Ati pe ko fẹ pupọ lati jẹ oun.
You can't take care of your child.	O ko le tọju ọmọ tirẹ.
Tell him what.	Sọ fun u kini.
The task is not as simple as it seems.	Iṣẹ naa ko rọrun bi o ṣe dabi.
He has changed his name ever since.	O ti yipada orukọ rẹ lati igba naa.
There is no time to lose.	Ko si akoko kan lati padanu.
How can you believe anything he tells you?	Bawo ni o ṣe le gbagbọ ohunkohun ti o sọ fun ọ?
It's amazing.	O jẹ iyanu.
I walked past.	Mo ti rin kọja.
But he can't think of that right now.	Ṣugbọn ko le ronu nipa iyẹn ni bayi.
That said, this is not my favorite.	Ti o sọ, eyi kii ṣe ayanfẹ mi.
Students often ask if he is a teacher.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe nigbagbogbo beere boya o jẹ olukọ.
For what it is.	Fun ohun ti o jẹ.
He was born.	O ti bi.
You need rest for our work.	O nilo isinmi fun iṣẹ wa.
It is just a whole other world.	O ti wa ni o kan kan gbogbo miiran aye.
At one point it seemed as if someone had taken the picture.	Ni aaye kan dabi enipe eniyan gba aworan naa.
Don't think, just do it !.	Maṣe ronu, kan ṣe!.
I know it exists, and so do others.	Mo mọ pe o wa, ati awọn miiran paapaa.
They get a lot of dog food.	Wọn gba ọpọlọpọ ounjẹ aja.
Everyone has to leave.	Gbogbo eniyan ni lati lọ kuro.
This was the day last month.	Eyi jẹ ọjọ ni oṣu to kọja.
Do you live in this city?	Ṣe o ngbe ni ilu yi?
Your story needs to be told.	Itan rẹ nilo lati sọ.
You must not go back.	Iwọ ko gbọdọ pada sẹhin.
You will die.	Iwọ yoo ku.
But for everyone.	Sugbon fun gbogbo eniyan.
In most cases.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
You agree with me on everything.	O gba pẹlu mi lori ohun gbogbo.
They don’t live together or anything like that.	Wọn ko gbe papọ tabi ohunkohun bii iyẹn.
We get the dogs in for a walk when we return.	A gba awọn aja ni fun rin nigba ti a ba pada.
They have something big.	Wọn ni nkan nla.
No one can separate himself from the eyes.	Ko si ẹniti o le ya ara rẹ kuro ni oju.
I don't need love anymore.	Nko nilo ife mo.
It's an opportunity.	O ni anfani.
They don’t feel anything.	Wọn ko lero nkankan.
I can deal with old school.	Mo ti le wo pẹlu atijọ ile-iwe.
Let me take you home.	Jẹ ki n mu ọ lọ si ile.
When will you return to work?	Nigbawo ni iwọ yoo pada si iṣẹ?
Something will happen to you and your car.	Nkankan yoo ṣẹlẹ si ọ ati ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ.
He knew it was not appropriate.	O mọ pe ko yẹ.
I will of course be back in the near future.	Emi yoo dajudaju pada wa ni ọjọ iwaju nitosi.
Others doubt its value.	Awọn miiran ṣiyemeji iye rẹ.
He took me.	O mu mi.
I can't find a place to do this.	Emi ko le rii ibiti o ti ṣe eyi.
I just don’t believe.	Emi ko kan gbagbọ.
It is determined that these devices are not working properly.	A ti pinnu pe awọn ẹrọ wọnyi ko ṣiṣẹ daradara.
The way he told me he loved me.	Ọna ti o sọ fun mi pe o nifẹ mi.
My lessons are important.	Awọn ẹkọ mi ṣe pataki.
I grew up.	Mo ti dagba soke.
These are not.	Awọn wọnyi ko si.
He has not done this before.	Ko ṣe eyi tẹlẹ.
They feel like they can really open up to him.	Wọn lero bi wọn ṣe le ṣii si i gaan.
There is a simple test for truth.	Idanwo ti o rọrun wa fun otitọ.
It works.	O n ṣiṣẹ.
He said he was.	O ni oun ni.
This is the time that changed your life.	Eyi ni akoko ti o yi igbesi aye rẹ pada.
She is married and has children.	O ti ni iyawo ati pe o ni awọn ọmọde.
I haven’t gotten out of bed myself yet.	Emi ko tii dide kuro ni ibusun funrararẹ sibẹsibẹ.
I was good about it.	Mo ti dara nipa rẹ.
It looks good.	O n wo daradara.
He will not put it on me.	Ko ni gbe e le mi.
Well done.	Daradara ṣe duro.
It should work fine now.	O yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ daradara ni bayi.
It’s nice to have a drink on that thing.	O dara lati ni mimu lori nkan yẹn.
And walk.	Ati ki o rin.
But he did not finish the work.	Ṣugbọn ko pari iṣẹ naa.
There is no way they will find us here.	Ko si ọna ti o ṣeeṣe ti wọn yoo rii wa nibi.
It was a beautiful work.	O je kan lẹwa iṣẹ.
They will not touch any of it.	Wọn kii yoo fi ọwọ kan eyikeyi ninu rẹ.
We have to continue.	A ni lati tẹsiwaju.
You may have written.	O le ti kọ.
Anyone can do that.	Ẹnikẹni le ṣe iyẹn.
And most of them are.	Ati pupọ julọ wọn jẹ.
That's enough picture.	Ti o ni aworan to.
The past for us.	Awọn ti o ti kọja fun wa.
They went out for a minute.	Wọn jade fun iṣẹju kan.
Lots of people stood up for us.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan dide fun wa.
I can't think of that.	Emi ko le ro ero eyi.
Others, like me, do not stop.	Awọn miiran, bii emi, ko duro.
This is my mother.	Eyi ni iya mi.
They do and they don’t think about it.	Wọn ṣe ati pe wọn ko ronu rẹ.
We stayed at his restaurant for a week.	A duro ni ile ounjẹ rẹ fun ọsẹ kan.
Let love and friendship never depart from your heart.	Jẹ ki ifẹ ati ọrẹ ko kuro ni ọkan rẹ.
I am out of thought at this point.	Mo wa jade ti ero ni aaye yi.
I know yourself.	Mo mọ ara rẹ.
Whatever happens to you is yours.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si ọ jẹ tirẹ.
They will be very happy after a while.	Wọn yoo dun pupọ lẹhin diẹ.
That doesn't mean it's time to dump her.	Iyẹn ko tumọ si pe o to akoko lati fi silẹ.
Find out more here.	Wa diẹ sii nibi.
Good for the moment.	O dara fun akoko naa.
Please do not go, please wait.	Jọwọ maṣe lọ, jọwọ duro.
But only then.	Sugbon nikan ki o si.
There are electric lights but no drinking water.	Awọn ina ina wa ṣugbọn ko si omi mimu.
It seems that the name means nothing to me.	O dabi pe orukọ naa ko tumọ si nkankan fun mi.
It does not and will not.	Ko ṣe ati pe kii yoo ṣe.
You need to know.	O nilo lati mọ.
Did not see so many.	Ko ri ki ọpọlọpọ awọn.
But no one can.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o le.
And, you can not see and touch information.	Ati, o ko le ri ati fi ọwọ kan alaye.
That's about all, baby.	Ti o ni nipa gbogbo, ọmọ.
There is great work to be done.	Iṣẹ nla wa lati ṣe.
We always knew when it was about.	A nigbagbogbo mọ nigbati o wà nipa.
Who is he?	Ta ni oun.
I can give you a job.	Mo le fun ọ ni iṣẹ.
Find out what they did when they stopped.	Wa ohun ti wọn ṣe nigba ti wọn duro.
Let me think about it and get back to you.	Jẹ ki n ronu lori rẹ ki o pada si ọdọ rẹ.
On your own, on your own.	Lori ara rẹ, ni ara rẹ.
I caught myself.	Mo mu ara mi mu.
I am not sure what the deal is.	Emi ko da mi loju kini adehun naa jẹ.
I am the same as you.	Mo jẹ kanna bi iwọ.
This was the most places.	Eleyi je julọ ibiti.
And it was a great thing.	Ati pe o jẹ ohun nla.
I do not know where we are.	Emi ko mọ ibiti a wa.
Maybe we should have lunch one day.	Boya o yẹ ki a jẹ ounjẹ ọsan ni ọjọ kan.
There are no beds to make, or jobs to do.	Ko si awọn ibusun lati ṣe, tabi awọn iṣẹ lati ṣe.
Try to repeat the question.	Gbiyanju lati tun ibeere naa ṣe.
It is only for one day.	O jẹ fun ọjọ kan nikan.
Can't remember your name or why you were there.	Ko le ranti orukọ rẹ tabi idi ti o fi wa nibẹ.
The talk ended shortly before noon.	Ọrọ naa pari ni kete ṣaaju ọsan.
It took as an opportunity.	O mu bi anfani.
Let me know what your favorite is.	Jẹ ki n mọ ohun ti o jẹ ayanfẹ rẹ.
I was finished for the day.	Mo ti pari fun ọjọ naa.
Let's see this in a minute.	Jẹ ki a wo eyi ni iṣẹju kan.
But he thinks he can at least be given another world.	Ṣugbọn o ro pe o le ni o kere ju ti fun ni aye miiran.
But there will be enough time for that one day.	Ṣugbọn akoko yoo to fun iyẹn ni ọjọ kan.
What you do is make it feel better.	Ohun ti o ṣe ni lati jẹ ki o lero dara julọ.
In the end he took it upon himself to tell the truth.	Ni ipari o mu ara rẹ lati sọ otitọ.
Her husband, my father, has been a doctor.	Ọkọ rẹ, baba mi, ti jẹ dokita kan.
I should have known better.	Mo yẹ ki o mọ dara julọ.
Maybe you heard it.	Boya o gbọ rẹ.
The harder you try, the harder they get.	Awọn le ti o gbiyanju, awọn le ti won gba.
She is anxious.	O ni aniyan.
And know that it is true.	Ki o si mọ pe o jẹ otitọ.
I have a cat, and it is very beautiful.	Mo ni ologbo kan, ati pe o lẹwa pupọ.
I don’t know much about it.	Emi ko mọ pupọ nipa rẹ.
There is nothing in it.	Ko si nkankan ninu rẹ.
I may want one.	Mo le fẹ ọkan.
I knew he was scared.	Mo mọ pe o bẹru.
But there is more to be done.	Ṣugbọn pupọ wa lati ṣee ṣe.
I can not change the rule.	Nko le yi ofin naa pada.
This story is not surprising to me.	Itan yii ko jẹ iyalẹnu fun mi.
Or at least understand why it is important.	Tabi o kere ju loye idi ti o ṣe pataki.
You get them some new clothes.	O gba wọn diẹ ninu awọn aṣọ tuntun.
You need to know the right time to do it.	O nilo lati mọ akoko ti o tọ lati ṣe.
Write something on it.	Kọ nkankan lori rẹ.
Our friends below may not know we are there for them.	Awọn ọrẹ wa ni isalẹ le ma mọ pe a wa si wọn.
It says a lot of things that mean.	O sọ ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan ti o tumọ si.
And every time they played it, they heard me.	Ati ni gbogbo igba ti wọn ṣe ere rẹ, wọn gbọ mi.
You will not be with them completely.	Iwọ kii yoo wa pẹlu wọn patapata.
Maybe that works for you, and it's amazing if you do.	Boya iyẹn ṣiṣẹ fun ọ, ati pe o jẹ iyanu ti o ba ṣe.
I am as happy as you can be.	Inu mi dun bi o ti le jẹ.
There is nothing in the car.	Ko si nkankan ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
I can see what we did and what we did not do.	Mo le rii ohun ti a ṣe ati ohun ti a ko ṣe.
We will of course be there.	A yoo dajudaju wa.
Today, he thinks he can see the future.	Loni, o ro pe o le rii ọjọ iwaju.
People look and wonder.	Eniyan wo ati iyalẹnu.
Talk to us.	Ba wa sọrọ.
Well, and off things, obviously.	Daradara, ti o si pa ohun, o han ni.
You can really see and hear everything here, too.	O le gan ri ki o si gbọ ohun gbogbo nibi, ju.
With others you will just as well not know.	Pẹlu awọn miiran iwọ yoo kan bi daradara ko mọ.
But they must do what they are told.	Ṣugbọn wọn gbọdọ ṣe ohun ti a sọ fun wọn.
The trees stand for attention.	Awọn igi duro si akiyesi.
Nothing we do helps.	Ko si ohun ti a ṣe ni iranlọwọ.

Does your hair grow long?	Ṣe irun ori rẹ dagba gun bi?
We do not know where we are going.	A ko mọ ibiti a yoo lọ.
Their eyes told me a lot.	Oju won so fun mi pupo.
Not games.	Ko awọn ere.
It didn’t help last year.	Ko ni iranlọwọ ni ọdun to kọja.
She looks very young.	O dabi ọmọde pupọ.
I can only do that.	Mo le ṣe nikan.
But together, we stay in the world.	Ṣugbọn papọ, a duro ni aye.
Bad people make it easy.	Awọn eniyan buburu jẹ ki o rọrun.
Do something relevant.	Ṣe nkan iroyin ti o yẹ.
Everything turned on her head.	Ohun gbogbo yipada si ori rẹ.
One more long and wonderful day.	Ọkan diẹ gun ati ọjọ iyanu.
There are so many of them.	Nibẹ ni ki ọpọlọpọ awọn ti wọn.
I hate it for you.	Mo korira rẹ fun o.
Things they say they think you can use.	Awọn nkan ti wọn sọ pe wọn ro pe o le lo.
Of course not.	Dajudaju o ko.
It is not that you think your opinion is wrong.	Kii ṣe pe o ro pe ero rẹ jẹ aṣiṣe.
It changed my life.	O yi igbesi aye mi pada.
He was not away.	O je ko kuro.
You have to know.	O ni lati mọ.
It took several years to make this decision.	O gba ọdun pupọ lati ṣe ipinnu yii.
I want to be with you, to see why.	Mo fe lati wa pẹlu rẹ, lati ri idi ti.
They will stay this way for a while.	Wọn yoo duro ni ọna yii fun igba diẹ.
He enjoyed the service.	O gbadun iṣẹ naa.
They are usually out every two years.	Nigbagbogbo wọn jade ni ọdun meji.
None of this seems possible.	Ko si eyi ti o dabi pe o ṣeeṣe.
Certainly less than a book.	O daju pe o kere ju iwe lọ.
And when you're done, when you're dead, open the back door.	Ati nigbati o ba ti pari, nigbati o ba ti ku, ṣii ilẹkun ẹhin.
I do not hate anyone, and they do not hate me.	Emi ko korira ẹnikẹni, ati pe wọn ko korira mi.
Keep books and books in the same place.	Tọju awọn iwe ati awọn iwe ni aaye kanna.
I look forward to working with you again, especially.	Mo n reti lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ lẹẹkansi, paapaa.
It doesn't really benefit me.	Ko ni anfani si mi gaan.
Most, but not all, are women.	Pupọ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe gbogbo wọn, jẹ awọn obinrin.
They seem to be right.	O dabi pe wọn tọ.

He does not know more than that.	Ko mọ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.

It really depends on how good it is.	O da lori gaan lori bi o ṣe dara to.
They want something.	Wọn fẹ nkan.
Obviously, it is my job.	O han gbangba, iṣẹ mi ni.
Obviously.	O han gbangba.
He sat back.	O joko pada.
He stated his purpose.	O sọ idi rẹ.
This is what gives them their power.	Eyi ni ohun ti o fun wọn ni agbara wọn.
If anyone can help any it will be amazing.	Ti ẹnikẹni ba le ṣe iranlọwọ eyikeyi ti yoo jẹ iyalẹnu.
We just killed ourselves.	A kan pa ara wa ni.
It will not do anything.	Ko ni ṣe ohunkohun.
Good weather.	Oju ojo ti o dara.
I can not stop myself.	Nko le da ara mi duro.
Human resources in this area are not enough.	Agbara eniyan ni agbegbe yii ko to.
No other true story.	Ko si itan otitọ miiran.
Every marriage has its ups and downs.	Gbogbo igbeyawo ni igba ti o dara ati buburu.
None of us can say how it will go.	Eyikeyi ninu wa ko le sọ bi yoo ṣe lọ.
We do not know what he did, or what he did not do.	A ko mọ ohun ti o ṣe, tabi ohun ti ko ṣe.
But nothing changed.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o yipada.
And there is no reason for him to think that anyone will have it now.	Ati pe ko si idi fun u lati ro pe ẹnikẹni yoo ni bayi.
Leave before dawn.	Lọ kuro ṣaaju owurọ.
So, look at it.	Nitorina, wo si o.
We have nothing.	A ko ni nkankan.
Try to think.	Gbiyanju lati ronu.
Just one.	O kan ni ọkan.
Maybe he'll say his name.	Boya oun yoo sọ orukọ rẹ.
Not available.	Ko wa.
It is a way.	O jẹ ọna kan.
I do not want you to hurt my friends.	Emi ko fẹ ki o ṣe ipalara awọn ọrẹ mi.
Do not write anything like other people if you can help.	Maṣe kọ ohunkohun bi awọn eniyan miiran ti o ba le ṣe iranlọwọ.
From all your friends.	Lati gbogbo awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
They have no place to go.	Wọn ko ni aye lati lọ.
Did you know?	Ṣe o mọ?
He moved away.	O gbe kuro.
However, there are other questions that arise in this system.	Sibẹsibẹ, ibeere miiran tun wa ti o dide ni eto yii.
But they can't do anything '.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko le ṣe ohunkohun'.
The food cost three times as much as expected.	Iye owo ounjẹ naa ni igba mẹta bi o ti ṣe yẹ.
That was the wrong way to go about it.	Iyẹn jẹ ọna ti ko tọ lati lọ nipa rẹ.
She learned what her husband did.	O kọ ohun ti ọkọ rẹ.
I just need a little life.	Mo kan nilo aye kekere kan.
Now they don’t understand much.	Bayi wọn ko ni oye pupọ.
A person who may not have.	Eniyan ti o le ko ni.
They are all in your eyes.	Gbogbo wọn ni oju rẹ.
One more time.	Igba kan si i.

We want to do what we want.	A fẹ ṣe ohun ti a fẹ.
We do not expect them to return home.	A ko nireti pe wọn yoo pada si ile.
But he slept fast.	Sugbon o sun sare.
The main houses are wood.	Awọn ile akọkọ jẹ igi.
My marriage began to suffer.	Igbeyawo mi ti bẹrẹ si ni wahala.
Now it changed.	Bayi o yipada.
Good with me.	O dara pẹlu mi.
Even the tree died soon after.	Paapaa igi naa ku laipẹ lẹhin naa.
Hard course but fun.	Lile dajudaju sugbon fun.
There is nothing like that.	Ko si nkankan bi iyẹn.
The house was purchased with cash as a gift.	A ra ile naa pẹlu owo bi ẹbun.
It makes everyone afraid.	O n jẹ ki gbogbo eniyan bẹru.
I did not take your name, sorry.	Emi ko mu orukọ rẹ, ma binu.
She is married.	O ti ni iyawo.
For all of them.	Fun gbogbo won.
You do not know how much water you will need.	Iwọ ko mọ iye omi ti iwọ yoo nilo.
You talked about it you did.	O ti sọrọ nipa rẹ ti o ṣe.

We cannot live without water.	A ko le gbe laisi omi.
And everyone, really.	Ati gbogbo eniyan, ni otitọ.
So he hurried to the front of the houses.	Nitorina o yara si iwaju awọn ile.
I am nothing without a home.	Emi ko jẹ nkankan laisi ile.
This is how you like it, this is how you get it.	Eyi bi o ṣe fẹ, eyi ni bi o ṣe gba.
This is my birth father.	Eyi ni baba ibi mi.
If you are not going to do that now.	Ti o ko ba lọ ṣe iyẹn ni bayi.

He used to call me a brother.	O maa n pe mi ni arakunrin.
I definitely lost my dad.	Mo daju padanu baba mi.
That’s the way it is.	Iyẹn ni iru ọna ti o jẹ.
You will not do such a thing.	Iwọ kii yoo ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ.
It's just a mistake.	O kan jẹ aṣiṣe.

They know him well.	Wọn mọ ọ daradara.
If so, move it.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, gbe e.
We talked about it.	A ti sọrọ rẹ lori.
Can you tell me what to do for them first.	O le sọ fun mi kini ohun ti yoo ṣe fun wọn ni akọkọ.
Sometimes my ears will ring.	Nigba miiran eti mi yoo dun.

However, it is good to know that you can do either.	Sibẹsibẹ, o dara lati mọ pe o le ṣe boya.
How do you.	Bawo ni o ṣe.
To be your eyes and ears.	Lati jẹ oju ati eti rẹ.
Most men need to see things before they believe them.	Pupọ awọn ọkunrin nilo lati rii awọn nkan ṣaaju ki wọn gba wọn gbọ.
You have to go back to the car to get that.	O ni lati pada si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ lati gba iyẹn.

They don't seem to exist.	O dabi pe wọn ko si tẹlẹ.

Your term will be two years.	Akoko rẹ yoo jẹ ọdun meji.
Fields and table names.	Awọn aaye ati awọn orukọ tabili.
I have tried many other things and nothing works.	Mo ti gbiyanju ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun miiran ati pe ohunkohun ko ṣiṣẹ.
It's high enough!	O ti ga to!
So this law has no application.	Nitorina ofin yi ko ni ohun elo.
All other children were adopted.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọ miiran ni a ti gbe.
This place made sense to him.	Ibi yi ṣe ori fun u.
I think we need that.	Mo ro pe a nilo iyẹn.
I'll be back there tomorrow morning.	Emi yoo pada wa nibẹ ni owurọ ọla.
One of the most important things is to know your application.	Ọkan ninu awọn ohun pataki julọ ni lati mọ ohun elo rẹ.
And by the way, you are not my son.	Ati nipasẹ ọna, iwọ kii ṣe ọmọ mi.
If it is going we will pull the books up tomorrow.	Ti o ba jẹ lilọ a yoo fa awọn iwe soke ni ọla.
Nobody wants to be that person.	Ko si ẹniti o fẹ lati jẹ eniyan yẹn.
The sea is full of life.	Okun n kun fun igbesi aye.

Don’t try to travel with the group.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati rin irin-ajo pẹlu ẹgbẹ.

This was one of those moments.	Eyi jẹ ọkan ninu awọn akoko yẹn.
The two desires of your life.	Awọn ifẹ meji ti igbesi aye rẹ.
May even more than that he died.	Le paapaa ju pe o ku.
In their opinion, that is a mistake.	Ni ero wọn, iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe.
He turned his head to listen.	O yi ori rẹ pada lati gbọ.
People were everywhere.	Eniyan wà nibi gbogbo.
Probably an unthinkable one.	O ṣeeṣe kan ti ko ronu tẹlẹ.
You don’t ask yourself these questions anymore.	O ko beere ara rẹ ni ibeere wọnyi mọ.
Be very nice.	Jẹ dara pupọ.
Reach and you can touch.	De ọdọ ati pe o le fi ọwọ kan.
He left me and that was good.	O fi mi silẹ ati pe iyẹn dara.
It’s just as simple as that.	O kan rọrun bi iyẹn.
Okay, there you are.	O dara, nibẹ o wa.
This is what you want, isn't it?	Eyi ni ohun ti o fẹ, ṣe kii ṣe bẹ?
Don't doubt why.	Maṣe ṣiyemeji idi.

But the children.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọmọ.
His hand was on his thigh, he put it on that hard street.	Ọwọ ni itan rẹ, o fi si ita ti o nira yẹn.
He always enjoyed talking to her.	Nigbagbogbo o gbadun lati ba a sọrọ.
The situation is what it is.	Ipo naa jẹ ohun ti o jẹ.
Given to me.	Ti fun mi.
Do not be afraid.	Maṣe bẹru.
I think that will only continue.	Mo ro pe iyẹn yoo tẹsiwaju nikan.
Some of them are married and do not get the attention they need.	Diẹ ninu wọn ti ni iyawo ati pe ko gba akiyesi ti wọn nilo.
It is the only game in town.	O jẹ ere nikan ni ilu.
Some people stand without legs.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ti o duro ti ko ni ẹsẹ.
Try something completely new.	Gbiyanju nkan tuntun patapata.
You have decided that you need a new job.	O ti pinnu pe o nilo iṣẹ tuntun kan.
They are usually used hot.	Nigbagbogbo wọn lo gbona.
It’s changing things.	O n yi nkan pada.
They are all important questions to ask.	Gbogbo wọn jẹ awọn ibeere pataki lati beere.
I can't reach you up there.	Emi ko le de ọdọ rẹ soke nibẹ.
When something is simple, people will use.	Nigbati nkan ba rọrun, eniyan yoo lo.

You have to experiment to find what works best for you.	O ni lati ṣe idanwo lati wa ohun ti o dara julọ fun ọ.
The name of the station is first.	Orukọ ibudo naa jẹ akọkọ.

The driver sped away.	Awakọ naa sare sare.
I need to hear what you think.	Mo nilo lati gbọ ohun ti o ro.
One out yesterday.	Ọkan jade lana.
No one wants to do that.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹ ṣe iyẹn.
I had to figure out what happened to me and why.	Mo ni lati ro ero ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si mi ati idi ti.
Large, but high enough that they will not be visible.	Awọn nla, ṣugbọn ti o ga to pe wọn kii yoo han gbangba.
He said he almost did the work for himself.	O sọ pe o fẹrẹ ṣe iṣẹ fun ara rẹ.
And this song will change your life.	Ati orin yi yoo yi aye re pada.
We know how it works now.	A mọ ọna ti o ṣiṣẹ ni bayi.
That doesn't make sense to me.	Iyẹn ko ni oye fun mi.
This seems to be the right approach.	Eyi dabi pe o jẹ ọna ti o tọ.
But neither did I do everything.	Ṣugbọn bẹni emi ko ṣe ohun gbogbo.
I am not sure why that yet.	Emi ko ni idaniloju idi ti iyẹn sibẹsibẹ.
He would walk over and meet her.	Oun yoo rin lori ki o si pade rẹ.
He said he would let you know.	O sọ pe oun yoo jẹ ki o mọ.
The game will be played in two cities.	Awọn ere yoo wa ni ṣe ni ilu meji.

She thought about it.	O ro nipa rẹ.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe nipa rẹ.
Night after night.	Alẹ lẹhin alẹ.
There are some people who hate the city.	Awọn eniyan kan wa ti wọn korira ilu naa.
They know where their seats are.	Wọn mọ ibiti ijoko wọn wa.
They can’t have both.	Wọn ko le ni awọn mejeeji.
It always helps.	O nigbagbogbo ṣe iranlọwọ.
Now you hear me.	Bayi o gbọ mi.
In the end, you can get something good back.	Ni ipari, o le gba nkan ti o dara pada.
However, do something for me.	Sibẹsibẹ, ṣe nkankan fun mi.
I know with him a lot.	Mo mọ pẹlu rẹ pupọ.
From what? 	Lati kini?
They are right, of course.	Wọn tọ, dajudaju.
You may have something important to say.	O le ni nkan pataki lati sọ.
We do not accept that anymore.	A ko gba iyẹn mọ.
Their story dates back to ancient times.	Itan wọn bẹrẹ lati igba atijọ.
Everyone has one eye.	Gbogbo eniyan ni oju kan.
They cannot be sure what happened.	Wọn ko le ni idaniloju ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
I'm just not sure.	Mo kan ko da mi loju.
Wonderful cat.	Ologbo iyanu.
If not already important, it is now.	Ti ko ba ṣe pataki tẹlẹ, o jẹ bayi.
He did not accept.	Ko gba.
Who owns this money?	Tani o ni owo yii?
He said nothing to me.	Ko so nkankan fun mi.
It cannot be moved.	Ko ṣee gbe.
I give them power back.	Mo fun wọn ni agbara pada.
I mean, it is, but it is not so.	Mo tumọ si, o jẹ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ.
It is too late at night.	O ti pẹ ju ni alẹ.
I do not know why this happened.	Emi ko mọ idi ti eyi fi ṣẹlẹ.
This should work well enough, and it does.	Eyi yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ daradara to, ati pe o ṣe.
Not finished, of course.	Ko pari, dajudaju.
Just something else.	O kan ohun miiran.
This has taken me and me.	Eyi ti gba emi ati mi.
He has lived in the city all his life.	O ti gbe ni ilu ni gbogbo aye re.
This is not to believe that it is possible.	Eyi ko gbagbọ pe o ṣee ṣe dara julọ.
You can drink anything.	O le mu ohunkohun.
You may have broken my leg.	O le ti fọ ẹsẹ mi.
You probably thought of me in the rain.	O ṣee ṣe ki o ro mi ni ojo.
Tell them to wait.	Sọ fun wọn lati duro.
It must be kept.	Gbọdọ pa a mọ.
That doesn't really matter.	Iyẹn ko ṣe pataki pupọ.
I love you, have loved you, and will love you.	Mo nifẹ rẹ, ti nifẹ rẹ, ati pe yoo nifẹ rẹ.
I will tell you tomorrow.	Emi yoo sọ fun ọ ni ọla.
Wait, he said.	Duro, o sọ.
But it does not have to do.	Ṣugbọn ko ni lati ṣe.
He will not change.	Oun ko ni yipada.
It's too late, but it should be there now.	O ti pẹ, ṣugbọn o yẹ ki o wa nibẹ ni bayi.
The picture stolen is very small in question.	Aworan ji jẹ kekere pupọ ni ibeere.
We have beautiful children.	A ni lẹwa ọmọ.
They can’t help it.	Wọn ko le ṣe iranlọwọ.

He has asked for me and for me enough.	O ti beere fun mi ati fun mi ti o to.
In a moment, we will talk.	Ni igba diẹ, a yoo sọrọ.
You never know how long you'll have to wait.	O ko mọ bi o ṣe pẹ to ti iwọ yoo duro.
Make them important by making them strong.	Jẹ ki wọn ṣe pataki nipa ṣiṣe wọn ni agbara.
And it is also true.	Ati pe o tun jẹ otitọ.
Maybe you should be more confident about the future, he said to himself.	Boya o yẹ ki o ni idaniloju diẹ sii nipa ojo iwaju, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
He did not know what to do.	Ko mọ ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe.
Thus, we have no plan.	Bayi, a ko ni eto.
I want the best for my wife and children.	Mo fẹ ohun ti o dara julọ fun iyawo mi ati awọn ọmọ mi.
It takes a long way home.	O gba ọna pipẹ si ile.
He placed the letters on the table	O si gbe awọn lẹta lori tabili
It is not a physical thing.	Kii ṣe nkan ti ara.
The field is the same length.	Aaye naa jẹ ipari kanna.
You can be wrong about everything.	O le jẹ aṣiṣe nipa ohun gbogbo.
That is great.	Iyẹn jẹ nla.
But there was no room to talk to them.	Ṣugbọn ko si aaye lati ba wọn sọrọ.
I must admit that it is in your best interest.	Mo gbọdọ gba wipe o jẹ ninu rẹ ti o dara ju anfani.
It bought us more interest.	O ra wa diẹ anfani.
The sister who knew this, said nothing.	Arabinrin ti o mọ eyi, ko sọ nkankan.
Some of those people are my friends.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan yẹn jẹ ọrẹ mi.
We may have to stop work.	A le ni lati da iṣẹ duro.
It looks like a huge area.	O dabi agbegbe nla kan.
Hours passed.	Awọn wakati ti kọja.
But there is no plan.	Ṣugbọn ko si eto.
It is now.	O ni bayi.
This may be all the information we need.	Eyi le jẹ gbogbo alaye ti a nilo.
It is very important if you ask me.	O ṣe pataki pupọ ti o ba beere lọwọ mi.
Up as soon as possible.	Soke ni kete bi o ti ṣee.
Some are feeling.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni rilara.
Maybe we need a little rest.	Boya a nilo isinmi diẹ.
He looked at me.	O wo lori mi.
She’s at home, and nothing else matters right now.	O wa ni ile, ati pe ko si nkan miiran ti o ṣe pataki ni bayi.
We buy and give a lot of material gifts.	A ra ati fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹbun ohun elo.
Not taking it but the one time.	Ko mu o ṣugbọn awọn ọkan akoko.
In front of you something is happening.	Ni iwaju ohun kan n ṣẹlẹ.
It is important for several reasons.	O ṣe pataki fun awọn idi pupọ.
When, of course, he knew nothing.	Nigbawo, dajudaju, ko mọ nkankan.
I have to come.	Mo ni lati wa.
We tested this in two ways.	A ṣe idanwo eyi ni awọn ọna meji.
This is not a minute.	Eyi kii ṣe iṣẹju kan.
He told me last time that he loved me.	O sọ fun mi ni igba ikẹhin pe o nifẹ mi.
You have no idea what might happen in the next few minutes.	O ko ni imọran ohun ti o le ṣẹlẹ ni iṣẹju diẹ ti nbọ.
The road passes through the city.	Opopona naa gba ilu naa kọja.
He locked the door behind it.	O si ti ilẹkun lẹhin ti o.
Tell them you stand together, we stand together as one.	Sọ fun wọn pe o duro papọ, a duro papọ bi ọkan.
But he knew he understood.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe o loye.
You’d never run the day for yourself.	O fẹ ko ṣiṣe ni ọjọ fun ara rẹ.
And so you will.	Ati bẹ iwọ yoo.
They can only do that.	Awọn nikan ni wọn le ṣe.
He never lost his job.	Ko padanu iṣẹ rara.
They said so at home.	Wọn ti sọ bẹ ni ile.
Early morning hours.	Ni kutukutu owurọ wakati.
He turned and started again.	O yipada o bẹrẹ pada.
However even the best things can be broken.	Sibẹsibẹ paapaa awọn nkan ti o dara julọ le fọ.
I'm trying to help you out here.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ran o jade nibi.
His name is.	Orukọ rẹ ni.
Or you will see them.	Tabi o yoo ri wọn.
I'm worried.	Mo ni aniyan.
Few do.	Diẹ ṣe.
He always rolled his legs.	Nigbagbogbo o yi ẹsẹ rẹ lọ.
To talk to you.	Lati ba ọ sọrọ.
That would have been very possible to hope for.	Iyẹn yoo ti ṣeeṣe pupọ lati nireti fun.
Others do not look back.	Awọn miiran ko wo ẹhin.
Every year, the houses in the city are rented out.	Ni gbogbo ọdun, awọn ile ti o wa ni ilu ni a ya.
In fact, nothing.	Ni otitọ, ko si nkankan.
Nothing written yet.	Ko si ohun ti a kọ sibẹsibẹ.
They have not worked in a few years.	Wọn ko ṣiṣẹ ni ọdun diẹ.
See what you believe.	Wo ohun ti o gbagbọ.
But he was young.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ọdọ.
The flight took off in an hour.	Ofurufu lọ kuro ni wakati kan.
Just treat it and try to forget about it.	Kan tọju rẹ ki o gbiyanju lati gbagbe nipa rẹ.
For a while, nothing happened.	Fun awọn akoko diẹ, ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
If you are not there, the text will not appear.	Ti o ko ba wa nibẹ, awọn ọrọ kii yoo han.
I let you pick up the car.	Mo jẹ ki o gbe ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
This is night.	Eleyi jẹ alẹ.
That's what he did.	Ohun ti o ṣe niyẹn.
Try to help my team, try to do my job.	Gbiyanju lati ran ẹgbẹ mi lọwọ, gbiyanju lati ṣe iṣẹ mi.
We are not just another face.	A kii ṣe oju miiran nikan.
This may be the most annoying surprise of all.	Eyi le jẹ iyalẹnu ti o binu julọ ti gbogbo.
Again, they refused.	Lẹẹkansi, wọn kọ.
We have always stood behind it.	A ti nigbagbogbo duro lẹhin rẹ.
You have no one here on this with you.	O ko ni ẹnikan nibi lori eyi pẹlu rẹ.
Just try to help.	O kan gbiyanju lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
I am on my way now.	Mo wa lori ọna mi ni bayi.
He thought to put them in his mouth.	O ronu lati fi wọn si ẹnu rẹ.
He was one of two boys and a girl.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọmọkunrin meji ati ọmọbirin kan.
The truth is that they want us because we are killed.	Otitọ ni pe wọn fẹ wa nitori pe a pa.
Such a system does not understand money in the old years.	Iru eto bẹẹ ko ni oye owo ni awọn ọdun atijọ.
Just, it will not.	O kan, kii yoo.
But we can at least say this.	Sugbon a le ni o kere sọ eyi.
But it is not your place to say so.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe aaye rẹ lati sọ bẹ.
That’s an interesting idea.	Iyẹn jẹ ero ti o nifẹ si.
It takes everyone.	O gba gbogbo eniyan.
But not for long.	Sugbon ko fun gun.
It is very surprising.	O jẹ iyalẹnu pupọ.
You may even remember it as a child.	O le paapaa ranti rẹ bi ọmọde.
The two met in high school.	Awọn mejeeji pade ni ile-iwe giga.
So you have to tell it again and again.	Nitorina o ni lati sọ fun ọ lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
It all depends on your question.	O da lori ibeere rẹ patapata.
Most of the people are unemployed.	Pupọ ninu awọn eniyan naa ko ni iṣẹ.
Not much longer.	Ko Elo to gun.
None of them are gone now.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o lọ ni bayi.
I'm sorry.	Ma binu ma binu.
Not sure what this is about.	Ko daju kini eyi jẹ nipa.
I can understand how you feel.	Mo le ni oye bi o ṣe lero.
At least from the information you give.	O kere ju lati alaye ti o fun.
In every sense.	Ni gbogbo ori.
I tell you how.	Mo sọ fun ọ bawo.
I think they wore it out.	Mo ro pe wọn wọ o jade.
Do you think you will ever live?	Ṣe o ro pe iwọ yoo wa laaye lailai?
You drop that too.	O ju iyẹn silẹ pẹlu.
I know you may have been upset.	Mo mọ pe inu rẹ le ti jẹ.
Not sure but well understood.	Ko ṣe imọran ṣugbọn o loye daradara.
I totally agree with him.	Mo gba pẹlu rẹ patapata.
It says everything, even if you don’t remember it.	O sọ ohun gbogbo, paapaa ti o ko ba ranti rẹ.
She is already married.	O ti ṣe igbeyawo tẹlẹ.
Whatever it was, he tried to make it alive.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ, o gbiyanju lati ṣe awọn ti o laaye.
We can learn by doing.	A le kọ ẹkọ nipa ṣiṣe.
You can ask questions about a situation in a picture.	O le beere awọn ibeere nipa ipo kan ni aworan kan.
Do not be afraid to ask questions in class.	Maṣe bẹru lati beere awọn ibeere ni kilasi.
Many times he would tell me a lot.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba oun yoo sọ fun mi pupọ.
But do not start drinking.	Ṣugbọn maṣe bẹrẹ mimu.
Why he could still die.	Kini idi ti o tun le ku.
It was the love of music that started it all.	O jẹ ifẹ ti orin ti o bẹrẹ gbogbo rẹ.
However they are not.	Sibẹsibẹ wọn ko.
As you wish.	Bi o ṣe fẹ.
I think you will know that.	Mo ro pe iwọ yoo mọ iyẹn.
It worked, for a few days.	O ṣiṣẹ, fun awọn ọjọ diẹ.
They won't let me go.	Wọn kii yoo jẹ ki n lọ.
Sometimes this does not work.	Nigba miiran eyi ko ṣiṣẹ.
If they want him back, they can take him back.	Ti wọn ba fẹ ki o pada wa, wọn le mu u pada.
He moved forward.	O gbe iwaju.
I can play games.	Mo le ṣe awọn ere.
Maybe just drinking or whatever.	Boya o kan mimu tabi ohunkohun ti.
This is how it should be.	Eyi ni bi o ṣe yẹ ki o jẹ.
There is no reason to doubt it.	Ko si idi lati ṣiyemeji rẹ.
He would hear the man out.	Oun yoo gbọ ọkunrin naa jade.
Let's see how the story unfolds.	Jẹ ki a wo bi itan naa ṣe pari.
The man had decided to take it and use it.	Ọkunrin naa ti pinnu lati mu u ati lati lo.
Not in the world.	Ko si ninu aye.
It doesn’t help that they have to repeat everything for me.	Ko ṣe iranlọwọ pe wọn ni lati tun ṣe ohun gbogbo fun mi.
Both have been eliminated from the game.	Awọn mejeeji ni wọn ti yọ kuro ninu ere naa.
My body has never done so before.	Ara mi ko tii ṣe bẹ tẹlẹ.
Some of the people they work with walk up.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ti wọn ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rin soke.
But the words are.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọrọ naa jẹ.
You will be as good as new.	Iwọ yoo dara bi tuntun.
No one can put something together, that’s the problem.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o le fi nkan papọ, iyẹn ni iṣoro naa.
These are my last words.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn ọrọ ikẹhin mi.
I also close my eyes.	Mo tun pa oju mi ​​mọ.
He got to his feet and lifted me up.	O dide si ẹsẹ rẹ o si gbe mi soke.
This time he did not pull away.	Ni akoko yii ko fa kuro.
He has a name.	O si ni orukọ.
Save the world !!!!!!!!!!!!.	Gba aye !!!!!!!!!!!!.
Maybe the bad weather kept them going.	Boya oju ojo ti ko dara pa wọn mọ.
I have enough money to make through the month.	Mo ni owo ti o to lati ṣe nipasẹ oṣu naa.
Our team finished first.	Ẹgbẹ wa ti pari ni akọkọ.
This can never go away.	Eyi ko le lọ lailai.
Maybe by the time it comes, we’ll know more.	Boya ni akoko ti o ba de, a yoo mọ diẹ sii.
She needs a lot of help.	O nilo iranlọwọ pupọ.
It was not such a street.	O je ko iru kan ita.
And again.	Ati pe tun.
Have our friends.	Ni awọn ọrẹ wa.
Nothing evil, and yet.	Ko si ohun ti ibi, ati sibẹsibẹ.
Many students drop out of school after high school.	Pupọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe lọ kuro ni ile-iwe lẹhin ile-iwe giga.
I look at my own injuries.	Mo wo awọn ipalara ti ara mi.
I usually try to let something work until it is done.	Mo maa n gbiyanju lati jẹ ki nkan kan ṣiṣẹ titi yoo fi ṣe.
Wondering how my life has changed.	Iyalẹnu bawo ni igbesi aye mi ṣe yipada.
I have seen these men.	Mo ti ri awọn ọkunrin wọnyi.
You will find good seafood outside the city.	Iwọ yoo wa ounjẹ okun to dara ni ita ilu.
You better keep up the good work.	O dara ki o tẹsiwaju iṣẹ ti o dara.
Neither of us said a word.	Bẹni ninu wa ko sọ ọrọ kan.
No, they are not, and they have never been.	Rara, wọn kii ṣe, ati pe wọn ko tii ri.
Maybe that's a good idea.	Boya imọran ti o dara niyẹn.
It also gives you an understanding of the class.	O tun fun ọ ni oye ti kilasi.
I said.	Mo sọ.
You have not said so.	O ko ti sọ bẹ.
Many have to move.	Ọpọlọpọ ni lati gbe lọ.
Just don’t.	Nikan ko ṣe.
So the man has told the truth after all.	Nitorina ọkunrin naa ti sọ otitọ lẹhin gbogbo.
I should not expect you to know this.	Emi ko yẹ ki o nireti pe o mọ eyi.
But it works both ways.	Ṣugbọn o ṣiṣẹ awọn ọna mejeeji.
Both parents worked long hours.	Awọn obi mejeeji ṣiṣẹ fun wakati pipẹ.
I want to pick up now.	Mo fẹ lati gbe soke ni bayi.
I have not spoken to him since.	Emi ko ti ba a sọrọ lati igba naa.
But it has become irrelevant.	Ṣugbọn o ti di ko ṣe pataki.
They will help you, he said.	Wọn yoo ran ọ lọwọ, o sọ.
I am very happy.	Inu mi dun gan ni.
We do not like that idea.	A ko fẹran ero yẹn.
What we do.	Kini a ṣe.
But it worked.	Ṣugbọn o ṣiṣẹ.
You know this area well.	O mọ agbegbe yii daradara.
You do what you want to do.	O ṣe ohun ti o fẹ lati ṣe.
Wait late, sleep late.	Duro pẹ, sun pẹ.
Their mother told the truth.	Iya wọn sọ otitọ.
I'm looking at you, you say.	Mo n wo e, o ni.
I believe in the man he is.	Mo gbagbọ ninu ọkunrin ti o jẹ.
We need to let our advantage.	A nilo lati jẹ ki anfani wa.
But it shook my head.	Sugbon o mi ori.
I am sure you have.	Mo da mi loju pe o ni.
My advice is to buy a car with money.	Imọran mi ni lati ra ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan pẹlu owo.
It works really well.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara daradara.
But you are right.	Ṣugbọn o tọ.
Parents cannot bring themselves to accept the job.	Awọn obi ko le mu ara wọn gba lati gba iṣẹ naa.
He can't, he can't.	Ko le, ko le.
Speak up in class.	Sọ soke ni kilasi.
That may be why nothing happened.	Iyẹn le jẹ idi ti ko si nkankan ti o ṣẹlẹ.
She is a great girl.	O jẹ ọmọbirin nla.
And yet you want to know.	Ati sibẹsibẹ o fẹ lati mọ.
He is coming to get me.	O n bọ lati gba mi.
Let me give you some food on me.	Jẹ ki n fun ọ ni ounjẹ kan lori mi.
Well, this is not entirely true.	O dara, eyi kii ṣe otitọ patapata.
It was summer there.	O jẹ ooru nibẹ.
Many cars were wrecked during the rainy season.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ni o fọ ni akoko ti ojo.
It should be there.	O yẹ ki o wa nibẹ.
I get a lot of help.	Mo gba iranlọwọ pupọ.
It is a machine.	O jẹ ẹrọ kan.
In my box.	Ninu apoti mi.
Their conditions are hard.	Awọn ipo wọn jẹ lile.
Hit him in the face.	Lu u ni oju.
Most people do.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ṣe.
You can not eat both.	O ko le jẹ mejeeji.
But it is such a simple thing.	Sugbon o jẹ iru kan ti o rọrun nkankan.
But that, of course, is known only to the doctor.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn, dajudaju, ni a mọ si dokita nikan.
All your words have come true.	Gbogbo ọrọ rẹ ti jẹ otitọ.
He will never return to play.	Oun yoo ko pada lati mu ṣiṣẹ.
Is this store selling new books?	Ṣe ile itaja yii n ta awọn iwe tuntun bi?
There is something pulling in the back of your heart.	Nkankan wa ti n fa ni ẹhin ọkan rẹ.
In fact, this is true.	Ni otitọ, eyi jẹ otitọ.
It is winter.	Igba otutu ni.
That is great information.	Alaye nla niyẹn.
Tom believes that nothing is impossible.	Tom gbagbọ pe ko si ohun ti ko ṣee ṣe.
But it is also worth it.	Sugbon o jẹ tun tọ o.
I am passing the time, doing nothing special.	Mo n kọja akoko, ko ṣe nkankan ni pataki.
Temporary.	Fun igba diẹ.
This has never happened before.	Eyi ko tii ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
Maybe even a point.	Boya paapaa aaye kan.
Old books do not have to be returned.	Awọn iwe atijọ ko ni lati da pada.
The name is a word.	Orukọ jẹ ọrọ kan.
But he was there.	Ṣugbọn o wa nibẹ.
I will spend as much time as you get.	Emi yoo lo akoko pupọ bi o ṣe gba.
That is why it works.	Ti o ni idi ti o ṣiṣẹ.
You continue in any way you can.	O tẹsiwaju ni ọna eyikeyi ti o le.
Soon there was no driver at all.	Laipẹ ko ni awakọ rara.
I can get them for you.	Mo le gba wọn fun ọ.
I will talk to a man soon.	Emi yoo sọrọ si ọkunrin kan laipẹ.
What day is it today?	Ọjọ wo loni?
We sell power companies.	A ta awọn ile-iṣẹ agbara.
The baby's hand held firmly.	Ọwọ ọmọ naa gbe ni idaniloju.
You can come back and tell him, but he may not stop.	O le pada wa sọ fun u, ṣugbọn o le ma duro.
To say.	Lati sọ.
I just want to see what happens to them.	Mo kan fẹ lati wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si wọn.
I just run.	Mo kan sare.
He was angry with himself.	O binu si ara rẹ.
I just want to see it good.	Mo kan fẹ lati rii pe o dara.
You have to say.	O ni lati sọ.
He took her hand.	O mu ọwọ rẹ.
One of both can be used at a time.	Ọkan ninu awọn mejeeji le ṣee lo ni akoko kan.
This place is amazing in winter.	Ibi yii jẹ iyalẹnu ni igba otutu.
They have lived here for a long time.	Wọn ti gbe nibi fun igba pipẹ.
They have to be.	Wọn ni lati jẹ.
The less anyone knows about me the better.	Awọn kere ẹnikẹni mọ nipa mi awọn dara.
Make sure you are correct.	Rii daju pe o tọ.
But you can do this.	Ṣugbọn o le ṣe eyi.
They can't see.	Wọn ko le ri.
Only two went.	Meji nikan ni wọn lọ.
Please wash this thoroughly.	Jọwọ wẹ eyi daradara.
They talked.	Wọn ti sọrọ.
One thing is, or is not.	Ohun kan jẹ, tabi kii ṣe.
They will come.	Wọn yoo wa.
Some of us have been out of the cold for a long time.	Diẹ ninu wa ti jade ninu otutu fun igba pipẹ.
It makes you happy.	O mu inu rẹ dun.
You will only get yourself into trouble.	Iwọ yoo gba ara rẹ sinu wahala nikan.
I took advantage of that.	Mo lo anfani naa.
His eyes widened, looking back at his own.	Oju rẹ ṣi silẹ, o n wo pada si tirẹ.
The pilots refused to leave the plane.	Awọn awakọ ọkọ ofurufu kọ lati fi ọkọ ofurufu naa silẹ.
You should be angry.	O yẹ ki o binu.
They have not returned.	Wọn ko ti pada.
But in a way it was too late.	Ṣugbọn ni ọna kan o ti pẹ ju.
I used the wrong word.	Mo lo ọrọ ti ko tọ.
You can't see me.	O ko le ri mi.
Destroy your life.	Ba aye re je.
I want to be better than that.	Mo fẹ lati dara ju iyẹn lọ.
All of these are easy to beat.	Gbogbo awọn wọnyi ni o rọrun lati lu.
It's easy to love.	O rọrun lati nifẹ.
He said it was probably right.	O sọ pe o ṣee ṣe pe o tọ.
At least some things have not changed.	O kere ju diẹ ninu awọn nkan ko yipada.
In this way.	Ni ọna yii.
Maybe he did it again.	Boya o tun ṣe.
It is better not to think that.	O dara julọ lati ma ronu iyẹn.
He decided to restart music.	O pinnu lati tun bẹrẹ orin.
I still have many of them.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ti wọn si tun.
Should not read.	Ko yẹ ki o ka.
If you come back there will be.	Ti o ba pada wa nibẹ yoo ri.
I advised him to leave.	Mo gba a ni imọran lati lọ kuro.
There must be an error.	Aṣiṣe kan gbọdọ wa.
Same house, same parents, same streets.	Ile kanna, awọn obi kanna, awọn ita kanna.

You want to explain the truth of the situation.	O fẹ ṣe alaye otitọ ti ipo naa.

I can’t believe there are people who would do such a thing.	Emi ko le gbagbọ pe awọn eniyan wa ti yoo ṣe iru eyi.
I showed him into the big room, told him to sit down.	Mo fi i han sinu yara nla, sọ fun u pe ki o joko.
No one wrote that book.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o kọ iwe yẹn.
I was very happy when it was my time.	Inu mi dun pupọ nigbati o jẹ akoko mi.
To his father.	Si baba rẹ.
I will not see them again now.	Emi ki yoo ri wọn mọ ni bayi.
Everything was fine in the morning.	Ohun gbogbo dara ni owurọ.
His wife did not do everything.	Iyawo re ko gbogbo nkan lo.
They became a family.	Wọn di idile.
Tell him again.	Sọ fun u lẹẹkansi.
Well it wasn’t.	Daradara o je ko.
He killed them.	O pa wọn.
That leaves us with power.	Iyẹn fi wa silẹ pẹlu agbara.
A man who is not a father is not a man.	Eniyan ti kii ṣe baba kii ṣe ọkunrin.

You have to grow.	O ni lati dagba.
You have to do what you have to do.	O ni lati ṣe ohun ti o ni lati ṣe.

It is so beautiful.	O ti wa ni ki lẹwa.
He is your son.	Ọmọ rẹ ni.

Maybe you want to lose them, afraid to find the truth.	Boya o fẹ lati padanu wọn, bẹru lati ri otitọ.

Just tell the driver where you want to go.	O kan sọ fun awakọ ibiti o fẹ lọ.
It is not a physical thing.	Kii ṣe nkan ti ara.
This city sits on a hill.	Ilu yi joko lori oke kan.
She needs me to be there for her.	O nilo mi lati wa nibẹ fun u.
But not so with him.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ pẹlu rẹ.
All the time.	Ni gbogbo igba.
All men die sooner or later.	Gbogbo awọn ọkunrin ku pẹ tabi ya.
That is what it should be.	Ohun ti o yẹ ki o jẹ niyẹn.
Their home is on a large beach.	Ile wọn wa ni eti okun nla kan.
He asked for the home key.	O beere fun bọtini ile.
The eyes are open.	Awọn oju ti ṣi silẹ.
No one needs it anymore.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o nilo rẹ mọ.
That made the man hesitant.	Iyẹn jẹ ki ọkunrin naa ṣiyemeji.
I don't want you to know this.	Emi ko fẹ ki o mọ eyi.
Stress can make you miss a moment completely.	Wahala le jẹ ki o padanu akoko kan patapata.
I just can't help it.	Mo kan ko le ran o.
You want to go.	O fẹ lati lọ.
I tried to play hands until they passed.	Mo gbiyanju lati mu ọwọ ṣiṣẹ titi ti wọn fi kọja.
Some people expect the same thing.	Awọn eniyan kan n reti ohun kanna.
To, well, learn.	Lati, daradara, kọ ẹkọ.
I know he's a bad guy.	Mo mọ pe o jẹ eniyan buburu.
Now it is some of them.	Bayi o jẹ diẹ ninu wọn.
He doesn't like me at all.	Ko feran mi paapaa.
We think we are on the right track with this.	A ro pe a wa lori ọna ti o tọ pẹlu eyi.
He never knew.	Oun ko mọ rara.
Very good indeed.	O dara pupọ gaan.
It just doesn’t sound right in our heart.	O kan ko dun ni otitọ ninu ọkan wa.
They can’t deal with it.	Wọn ko le ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
And this is not the right time to have this issue.	Ati pe eyi kii ṣe akoko ti o tọ lati ni ọrọ yii.
Or in front of you.	Tabi ni iwaju rẹ.
So let them eat.	Nitorina jẹ ki wọn jẹ.
You don’t have to notice it.	O ko ni lati ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
But it really was all very fun and taken.	Sugbon o gan wà gbogbo gidigidi fun ati ki o ya.
No, no, we can't hear.	Rara, rara, a ko le gbọ.
I find that you love it very much.	Mo rii pe o nifẹ rẹ pupọ.
I have nothing to talk to you about.	Emi ko ni nkankan lati ba ọ sọrọ nipa.
As much as he loves to write stories.	Bii o ṣe nifẹ lati kọ awọn itan.
It doesn't work for a reason.	Ko ṣiṣẹ fun idi kan.
He picked up the clock.	O gbe aago soke.
Don't ignore this !, he said.	Maṣe yi eyi silẹ!, o sọ.
There may be many of them.	O le jẹ pupọ ninu wọn.
We don't need to go to school anymore.	A ko nilo lati lọ si ile-iwe mọ.
I never entered the class again.	Emi ko tun wọ inu kilasi naa.
I’m here because it shouldn’t matter.	Mo wa nibi nitori ko yẹ ki o ṣe pataki.
But these anxieties may be a thing of the past.	Ṣugbọn awọn aniyan wọnyi le jẹ ohun ti o ti kọja.
Again you can not say how long they will be.	Lẹẹkansi o ko le sọ bi o ṣe pẹ to ti wọn yoo jẹ.
He gave it to her.	O fun u.
You don't like it.	O ko fẹran rẹ.
It’s great, really.	O jẹ nla, ni otitọ.
This is your home.	Eyi ni ile rẹ.
I forgot something.	Mo gbagbe nkan.
But no one knows any of this.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ eyikeyi eyi.
I have a lot of questions.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere.
We are just waiting for you on the way from the house.	A kan duro de ọ ni ọna lati ile naa.
What if everyone on earth did this ?.	Kini ti gbogbo eniyan lori aye ba ṣe eyi?.
This year is the first year.	Odun yi ni odun akoko.
You have to make a deal.	O ni lati ṣe adehun kan.
We spent lunch on the beach.	A lo ọsan lori eti okun.
Nothing can make me afraid forever.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe mi bẹru lailai.
So do not draw attention to yourself.	Ki o maṣe fa akiyesi lati ọdọ awọn miiran.
There is no room in doing that.	Ko si aaye ninu ṣiṣe iyẹn.
That sounds like a difficult problem.	Iyẹn dabi iṣoro ti o nira.
Let’s not give up yet.	Jẹ ki a ko fun soke sibẹsibẹ.
As good as it gets at that point.	Bi o ti dara bi o ti gba ni aaye yẹn.
Maybe some time in the future that might make sense.	Boya diẹ ninu awọn akoko ni ojo iwaju ti o le ṣe ori.
I know ,.	Mo mọ,.
Where are the best places in the city?	Nibo ni awọn aaye to dara julọ wa ni ilu naa?
I went at three.	Mo lọ ni mẹta.
Such a problem has already happened.	Iru iṣoro bẹẹ ti ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
His eyes did not lock.	Oju rẹ ko tii.
My father wants me out.	Baba mi fe mi jade.
Remove anything that should not be.	Yọ ohunkohun ti ko yẹ ki o jẹ.
Everything he said sounded good.	Gbogbo ohun ti o sọ dabi ẹni pe o dun.
He came to the party with my brother.	O wa si ibi ayẹyẹ pẹlu arakunrin mi.
Everyone has something to say about it.	Gbogbo eniyan ni nkankan lati sọ nipa rẹ.
I want to make this more visible.	Mo fẹ lati jẹ ki eyi jẹ diẹ sii han.
And, they do.	Ati, wọn ṣe.
I promise to try to listen.	Mo ṣe ileri lati gbiyanju lati gbọ.
However, it is not that difficult, as you will see here.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe pe o nira, bi iwọ yoo rii nibi.
A man has to keep up with things.	Ọkunrin kan ni lati tẹsiwaju pẹlu awọn nkan.
It just doesn't work.	O kan ko ṣiṣẹ.
Just ask questions.	O kan beere awọn ibeere.
Again he rejected me.	Lẹẹkansi o kọ mi silẹ.
He decided to do it in two.	O pinnu lati ṣe ni meji.
This can be found everywhere.	Eleyi le ṣee ri nibi gbogbo.
He comes from another world.	O wa lati aye miiran.
I totally agree.	Mo gba patapata.
But he did.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe.
Don't look down.	Maṣe wo isalẹ.
Beat it well.	Lu rẹ daradara.
That does not mean we are dead.	Iyẹn ko tumọ si pe a ti ku.
All is well.	Gbogbo wa daradara.
I'll be back.	Emi yoo pada.
There is nothing you can do.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe.
His eyes dropped to the drinks.	Oju rẹ silẹ si awọn ohun mimu.
But that is not an idea at all.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe imọran rara.
Some trees are removed before long.	Diẹ ninu awọn igi ni a yọ kuro ṣaaju pipẹ.
But he knew he had to do something.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe o ni lati ṣe nkan kan.
And after a few days you will find another.	Ati lẹhin awọn ọjọ diẹ sii iwọ yoo rii miiran.
Go with it.	Lọ pẹlu rẹ.
The treaty forces members to pay for themselves.	Adehun fi agbara mu awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ lati san owo fun ara wọn.
That is not my place.	Iyẹn kii ṣe aaye mi.
Who knows, it might work.	Tani o mọ, o le ṣiṣẹ.
It’s about what you don’t like.	O jẹ nipa ohun ti o ko fẹ.
I'm sorry, man.	Ma binu, eniyan.
Get out of your way to be friends.	Lọ kuro ni ọna rẹ lati jẹ ọrẹ.
You can sleep on the bed with him.	O le sun lori ibusun pẹlu rẹ.
Sometimes young people will repeat.	Nigba miiran awọn ọdọ yoo tun.
I left the company and started looking for work.	Mo fi ile-iṣẹ silẹ mo bẹrẹ si wa iṣẹ.
Forget them in a car today.	Gbagbe wọn ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan loni.
Some details have changed.	Diẹ ninu awọn alaye ti yipada.
In what we hear, let us hear only.	Ninu ohun ti a gbọ, jẹ ki a gbọ nikan.
What does that mean? 	Se ohun ti o tumọ si?
I'm fine too.	Emi naa dara.
I hope some of these books do that for you.	Mo nireti pe diẹ ninu awọn iwe wọnyi ṣe iyẹn fun ọ.
No one can make me do them.	Ko si ẹniti o le ṣe mi ṣe wọn.
For him.	Fun u ni.
It's a big job.	Ise nla ni.
Someone says his name, but nothing.	Ẹnikan n sọ orukọ rẹ, ṣugbọn ko si ohun.
The brother looked up.	Arakunrin naa wo soke.
I will not let them.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki wọn.
He said he did not remember many of my questions.	O sọ pe oun ko ranti ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere mi.
Bad or not, let’s see.	Buburu tabi rara, jẹ ki a rii.
We must run.	A gbọdọ ṣiṣe.
We are down.	A ni isalẹ.
A thought! 	Ero kan!
No one came out.	Ko si ọkan ti o jade.
Or you could have no too.	Tabi o le ni ko si ju.
At this time, life is not much better than that.	Ni akoko yii, igbesi aye ko dara pupọ ju iyẹn lọ.
Can we take our places ?.	Njẹ a le gba awọn aaye wa?.
Let your feet decide.	Jẹ ki ẹsẹ rẹ pinnu.
More buildings need to be built.	Awọn ile diẹ sii nilo lati kọ.
The area was clear.	Agbegbe je ko o.
Tell me about what you are teaching them to do.	Sọ fun mi nipa ohun ti o n kọ wọn lati ṣe.
It doesn't matter to them anymore.	Ko ṣe pataki fun wọn mọ.
Know why.	Mọ idi.
You will get us through this.	Iwọ yoo gba wa nipasẹ eyi.
Do not do so if you do not like it.	Maṣe ṣe bẹ ti o ko ba fẹran rẹ.
Or at least, not with him.	Tabi o kere ju, kii ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
They think you will never know.	Wọn ro pe iwọ kii yoo mọ.
I am at home every week.	Mo ti wa ni ile ni gbogbo ọsẹ.
She is very angry.	O binu pupọ.
Don't buy too much.	Maṣe ra pupọ.
He refused to give his name.	O kọ lati fun orukọ rẹ.
I can't stress enough.	Emi ko le wahala ti o to.
Very good.	O dara pupọ.
They have not been home for months.	Wọn ko ni ile-iṣẹ ni awọn oṣu.
He was raised from a great age.	O ti gbe lati kan nla ọjọ ori.
I drink.	Mo mu.
All on your own.	Gbogbo lori ara rẹ.
I will not accept that at all.	Emi kii yoo gba iyẹn rara.
It seems like it must be the problem.	O dabi pe o gbọdọ jẹ iṣoro naa.
No, not so much as your love even.	Rara, kii ṣe pupọ bi ifẹ rẹ paapaa.
He was out of place.	O si wà jade ti ibi.
How much they changed their lives when her mother died.	Elo ni o ti yi igbesi aye wọn pada nigbati iya rẹ ku.
No music.	Ko si orin.
Water is your life.	Omi ni igbesi aye rẹ.
It is after one.	O jẹ lẹhin ọkan.
Don't like some of the others here, because.	Ko fẹ diẹ ninu awọn ti awọn miiran nibi, nitori.
It doesn't go for easy.	Ko lọ fun rọrun.
That is not any place for people like us.	Iyẹn kii ṣe aaye eyikeyi fun awọn eniyan bii wa.
He seemed to be talking to himself.	O dabi ẹni pe o n ba ara rẹ sọrọ.
You have always had something to eat.	O ti nigbagbogbo ni nkankan lati je.
Good to come back.	O dara lati pada wa.
This happens with little efficiency, but it happens.	Eleyi ṣẹlẹ pẹlu kekere ṣiṣe, sugbon o ṣẹlẹ.
I have no idea what caused this.	Emi ko ni imọran ohun ti o fa eyi.
He asked for the help of his friends.	O beere iranlọwọ ti awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
She loves to do some things, but not much.	O nifẹ lati ṣe diẹ ninu awọn nkan, ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ.
His art is amazing.	Iṣẹ ọna rẹ jẹ iyalẹnu.
This will give you time to change before you go alive.	Eyi yoo fun ọ ni akoko lati yi pada ṣaaju ki o to lọ laaye.
They do not know how this can happen.	Wọn ko mọ bi eyi ṣe le ṣẹlẹ.
I wore it in the river.	Mo ti wọ o ni odo.
Everyone knows who he is.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ ẹniti o jẹ.
No children.	Ko si ọmọ.
It is important to sort out the facts.	O ṣe pataki lati to awọn otitọ jade.
The impossible just needs to get out.	Awọn ti ko ṣee ṣe o kan nilo lati jade.
He tied his shoelaces.	O so awọn okun bata rẹ.
Making them the best.	Ṣiṣe wọn ti o dara ju.
Such people, they only need one or two.	Iru awọn eniyan bẹẹ, wọn nilo ọkan tabi meji nikan.
This is very good and everyone is happy.	Eyi dara pupọ ati pe inu gbogbo eniyan dun.
We are stuck with it.	A ti di pẹlu rẹ.
That will not work at this time.	Iyẹn kii yoo ṣiṣẹ ni akoko yii.
They think of them before they understand them.	Wọn ro wọn ṣaaju ki wọn loye wọn.
We talk, but we don't really talk.	A sọrọ, ṣugbọn a ko sọrọ gaan.
Can look amazing.	Le wo iyanu.
You never know what to expect from these people.	O ko mọ kini lati reti lati ọdọ awọn eniyan wọnyi.
No, no thought.	Rara, ko si ero.
He ended up sitting in the front seat.	O pari soke joko ni iwaju ijoko.
I gave her the book in the morning.	Mo fun mi ni iwe ni owurọ.
Internal organs.	Awọn ara inu ara.
I came back for that alone.	Mo pada wa fun iyẹn nikan.
I was afraid to try, and afraid not to.	Mo bẹru lati gbiyanju, ati bẹru ko lati.
Nothing takes away.	Ko si ohun ti o gba kuro.
He knew he would leave too.	O mọ pe o tun yoo lọ kuro.
These are not our job.	Awọn wọnyi ko ṣe iṣẹ wa.
You told it all to me.	O sọ gbogbo rẹ fun mi.
It went bad with little attention.	O lọ buburu pẹlu kekere akiyesi.
It can be about anything of course.	O le jẹ nipa ohunkohun dajudaju.
You can fill it.	O le kun fun u.
Tell me about your family.	Sọ fun mi nipa idile rẹ.
He is the kind of person who is open.	O jẹ iru eniyan ti o ṣii.
I should let it go first.	Mo yẹ ki n jẹ ki o lọ ni akọkọ.
It would have been small.	Yoo ti jẹ kekere.
His wife walked towards him.	Iyawo re rin si odo re.
I just called the police and I waited for them.	Mo kan pe ọlọpa ni mo duro de wọn.
Sometimes without arms or legs.	Nigba miiran laisi ọwọ tabi ẹsẹ.
Everyone needs to do so.	Gbogbo eniyan nilo lati ṣe bẹ.
The rules are not surprising.	Awọn ofin ko jẹ iyalẹnu.
You are always behind me.	Iwọ nigbagbogbo wa lẹhin mi.
Of course you do.	Dajudaju o ṣe.
So, good for them, especially !.	Nitorina, o dara fun wọn, paapaa!.
This is especially true with food.	Eyi jẹ otitọ paapaa pẹlu ounjẹ.
Some do it.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣe o.
I will break.	Emi yoo fọ.
I promise you will not be angry.	Mo ṣe ileri pe iwọ kii yoo binu.
Your father, for one.	Baba rẹ, fun ọkan.
That is not right.	Iyẹn ko tọ.
It should work to move, not allow to work.	O yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ lati gbe, kii ṣe laaye lati ṣiṣẹ.
We had good times.	A ni awọn akoko ti o dara.
I already understand your stuff and it’s just too high.	Mo ti loye nkan rẹ tẹlẹ si ati pe o kan ga julọ.
That is very important.	Nkan pataki niyen.
And days after that too.	Ati awọn ọjọ lẹhin ti o ju.
They see no reason in it.	Wọn ko ri idi kan ninu rẹ.
We want it fast and easy.	A fẹ ki o yara ati rọrun.
Not yourself.	Kii ṣe funrararẹ.
Don’t worry about helping with breakfast people.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan nipa iranlọwọ pẹlu awọn eniyan ounjẹ owurọ.
I always wonder if this is how everyone feels.	Mo nigbagbogbo Iyanu boya eyi ni bi gbogbo eniyan ṣe lero.
You may have walked away by now and no one will notice.	O le ti rin kuro ni bayi ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti yoo ṣe akiyesi.
For us, it was amazing.	Fun wa, o jẹ iyalẹnu.
But he said he saw no reason to continue living.	Ṣugbọn o sọ pe ko rii idi kan lati tẹsiwaju lati gbe.
There is no way you can live now.	Ko si ọna ti o le gbe ni bayi.
Please remember that.	Jọwọ ranti iyẹn.
But they are good at what they do.	Ṣugbọn wọn dara ni ohun ti wọn ṣe.
Of course this is my opinion.	Dajudaju eyi ni ero mi.
Such is the world.	Iru wà ni aye.
School starts in three weeks.	Ile-iwe bẹrẹ ni ọsẹ mẹta.
Everything is kept as it was.	Ohun gbogbo ti wa ni pa bi o ti wà.
He turned and went inside.	O yipada o si pada si inu.
They need to do the right thing and become law.	Wọn nilo lati ṣe ohun ti o tọ ki o di ofin.
Please keep an eye on this.	Jọwọ pa oju kan lori eyi.
Fire and its many.	Ina ati ọpọlọpọ rẹ.
But leave me in it.	Ṣugbọn fi mi silẹ ninu rẹ.
At that time it was too late.	Ni akoko yẹn o ti pẹ ju.
But there it is.	Sugbon o wa.
I came back to do nothing.	Mo pada lati ṣe ohunkohun.
We will talk to you.	A yoo sọrọ si o.
It will not fly.	Ko ni fo.
This is very important to us.	Eyi ṣe pataki fun wa gaan.
Remember this does not apply to me.	Ranti pe eyi ko kan mi.
The work world is changing.	Aye iṣẹ n yipada.
It makes it work.	O jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
Something about him knew, but could not be convinced.	Nkankan nipa rẹ mọ, ṣugbọn ko le ni idaniloju.
Lots of work for nothing.	Ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ fun ohunkohun.
The whole thing will be about what kind of agreement.	Gbogbo ọrọ naa yoo jẹ nipa iru adehun wo.
We are in this together.	A wa ninu eyi papọ.
There is not much room in it.	Ko si yara pupọ ninu.
But the truth is more complicated.	Ṣugbọn otitọ jẹ iṣoro diẹ sii.
They should have known.	Wọn yẹ ki o ti mọ.
It was an audio book.	O je ohun awon iwe.
Here is some of the book.	Eyi ni diẹ ninu iwe.
She tried to remember him completely.	O gbiyanju lati ranti rẹ patapata.
Let me know if you have any questions.	Jẹ ki mi mọ ti o ba ti o ba ni eyikeyi ibeere.
We can see that we cut ourselves.	A le rii pe a ge ara wa kuro.
Until a point.	Titi di aaye kan.
That, of course, would upset them.	Iyẹn, dajudaju, yoo binu wọn.
This is why they can break.	Eyi ni idi ti wọn le fọ.
This is not your child.	Eyi kii ṣe ọmọ rẹ.
Even more so when it continues.	Paapaa diẹ sii nigbati o tẹsiwaju.
I think this is correct.	Mo ro pe eyi tọ.
That is.	Iyẹn ni.
Just let them know you found it.	O kan jẹ ki wọn mọ pe o rii.
He is reading a book.	O n ka iwe.
But as you said, it could be the last three games.	Ṣugbọn bi o ti sọ, o le jẹ awọn ere mẹta ti o kẹhin.
Do not talk to me.	Maṣe ba mi sọrọ.
If we die, do not open that door.	Ti a ba ku, maṣe ṣi ilẹkun yẹn.
We knew it was our last time together.	A mọ pe o jẹ akoko ikẹhin wa papọ.
I must lose some key understanding.	Mo gbọdọ padanu oye bọtini diẹ.
He’s doing a great job here.	O n ṣe iṣẹ nla nibi.
Just sleep in.	O kan sun ni.
It is advisable to keep to the road.	O ni imọran lati tọju si ọna.
Most of the time there is no problem.	Ọpọlọpọ igba ko si iṣoro.
Water in a car.	Omi inu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
It is as it is.	O jẹ bi o ṣe jẹ.
He died, maybe not.	O ku, boya kii ṣe.
He did not tell them.	Ko sọ fun wọn.
This way, you can pay the bill on time.	Ni ọna yii, o le san owo naa ni akoko.
But this is not the case.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe bẹ.
But even without that.	Ṣugbọn paapaa laisi iyẹn.
Clean up with it.	Ninu pẹlu rẹ.
But it will be important.	Ṣugbọn yoo ṣe pataki.
So sorry for that.	Nitorina binu fun eyi.
Everyone must die one day.	Gbogbo eniyan gbọdọ ku ni ọjọ kan.
That could be.	Iyẹn le jẹ.
But that is not enough.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko to.
I am not here for you.	Emi ko wa nibi fun o.
He never told me about this at all.	Ko sọ fun mi nipa eyi rara.
It was a gift enough to talk to him.	O ti jẹ ẹbun ti o to lati ba a sọrọ.
These are paper boxes.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn apoti iwe.
I could have done this without my father.	Mo le ṣe eyi laisi baba mi.
He never let me finish.	O ko jẹ ki n pari.
Don't let it go yet.	Maṣe jẹ ki lọ sibẹsibẹ.
Maybe we don't need to climb that mountain.	Boya a ko nilo lati gun oke yẹn.
It also has two aids.	O tun ni awọn iranlọwọ meji.
You are the people.	Iwọ ni awọn eniyan naa.
It felt like an important thought.	O ro bi ero pataki kan.
There is another supermarket on the way.	Ile itaja nla miiran wa ni ọna.
Born with my mother.	Bi pẹlu iya mi.
One thing we love to do is go for a walk.	Ohun kan ti a nifẹ lati ṣe ni lilọ fun rin.
Not my favorite.	Kii ṣe ayanfẹ mi.
The company rejected all notices.	Ile-iṣẹ naa kọ gbogbo awọn akiyesi.
How they do.	Bawo ni wọn ṣe ṣe.
Fortunately, it is the only thing that does so.	Da, o jẹ nikan ni nkan ti o ṣe bẹ.
You will see a couple of books.	Iwọ yoo wo awọn iwe meji kan.
That doesn't matter now.	Iyẹn ko ṣe pataki ni bayi.
But every family has to do what works for them.	Ṣugbọn gbogbo idile ni lati ṣe ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ fun wọn.
She looked him up and down.	O wo u soke ati isalẹ.
Whatever your decision, it will explain it.	Ohunkohun ti ipinnu rẹ, yoo ṣe alaye rẹ.
People know this place.	Eniyan mọ ibi yi.
That's what they want us to do.	Ohun ti wọn fẹ ki a ṣe niyẹn.
That’s good news, at least.	Iyẹn jẹ iroyin ti o dara, o kere ju.
And you know why.	Ati pe o mọ idi.
I can work all day.	Mo le ṣiṣẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Some foods are completely banned.	Awọn ohun ounjẹ kan ni a ti fi ofin de patapata.
I asked him if he was ever scared.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ boya o bẹru lailai.
Do not talk when eating.	Maṣe sọrọ nigbati o ba jẹun.
It is best to wash our hair in the morning.	O dara julọ lati fọ irun wa ni owurọ.
And there are no rules.	Ati pe ko si awọn ofin.
But that was weeks before.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ ọsẹ ṣaaju.
Life happens.	Igbesi aye n ṣẹlẹ.
I shook my head.	Mo mi ori.
They called my name first.	Wọn pe orukọ mi ni akọkọ.
Everything and everyone.	Ohun gbogbo ati gbogbo eniyan.
It's happening now.	O n ṣẹlẹ ni bayi.
We don't have enough of it yet.	A ko ni to ti o sibẹsibẹ.
These people, they are families.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi, idile ni wọn.
We have to eat.	A ni lati jẹ.
Of course he would have given them that if there was no other way.	Dajudaju oun yoo ti fun wọn ni iyẹn ti ko ba si ọna miiran.
The table can be moved.	A le gbe tabili naa.
I was only at the bottom of the boat.	Mo wa nikan ni isalẹ ti ọkọ.
They will need it.	Wọn yoo nilo rẹ.
When can water be taken as water.	Nigbawo ni a le mu omi bi omi.
Now, let's see if you can do this.	Bayi, jẹ ki a wo boya o le ṣe eyi.
It comes after something to eat.	O wa lẹhin nkan lati jẹ.
Now put them out.	Bayi fi wọn jade.
That did not happen on their wedding day.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ ni ọjọ igbeyawo wọn.
Only trees.	Awọn igi nikan ni.
Of course this may not come as any surprise.	Dajudaju eyi ko le wa bi iyalẹnu eyikeyi.
I don't think much.	Emi ko ronu pupọ.
I need some help.	Mo nilo iranlọwọ diẹ.
There is no way to know.	Ko si ọna ti o mọ.
He repeated this several times.	O tun yi ni igba pupọ.
They called the police.	Wọn pe ọlọpa.
Go out before you get home.	Lọ jade ṣaaju ki o to de ile.
He left you.	O fi ọ silẹ.
She told him it could be.	O sọ fun u pe o le jẹ.
The book is not already there.	Iwe naa ko tii wa nibẹ tẹlẹ.
Again it changed.	Lẹẹkansi o yipada.
Not a big surprise.	Kii ṣe iyalẹnu nla kan.
The car accident still strikes me.	Ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa ṣi n kan mi.
If they break, it is their problem.	Ti wọn ba fọ, iṣoro wọn ni.
My other friends helped me.	Awọn ọrẹ mi miiran ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi.
She is in her room.	O ti wa ninu yara rẹ.
They will not be able to stop it.	Wọn kii yoo ni anfani lati da a duro.
They want a place.	Wọn fẹ ibi kan.
But of course.	Sugbon dajudaju.
I need to buy more materials.	Mo nilo lati ra awọn ohun elo diẹ sii.
Some people do not want to do.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ko fẹ lati ṣe.
It tastes great.	O dun pupo.
You have only one life.	O ni nikan kan aye.
Think only of opportunity.	Ronu nipa anfani nikan.
You've said a lot.	O ti sọ pupọ.
Two people died in the crash.	Eniyan meji ku ninu ijamba naa.
You can hear music from our house.	O le gbọ orin lati ile wa.
She did very well, because she was a girl.	O ṣe dara julọ, nitori ọmọbirin ni.
I don’t know what else to say to that.	Emi ko mọ kini ohun miiran lati sọ si iyẹn.
I do not want anything to do with it.	Emi ko fẹ nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
Don't say football.	Maṣe sọ bọọlu.
It is nothing.	Ko jẹ ohunkohun.
I can not give up on this.	Emi ko le fun soke lori yi.
They can’t be important.	Wọn ko le ṣe pataki.
It just seems, well, this is the kind of work for me.	O kan dabi, daradara, eyi jẹ iru iṣẹ fun mi.
It is not often we take advantage.	O ti wa ni ko igba a gba awọn anfani.
Raise your hand over your head.	Gbe ọwọ rẹ soke lori ori rẹ.
I was alone.	Mo ti wà nikan.
You can not do that with children.	O ko le ṣe bẹ pẹlu awọn ọmọde.
So, physically there is no stress.	Nitorina, nipa ti ara ko ni wahala.
He tried to lock the door.	O gbiyanju lati ti ilẹkun si.
He said he needed time to sort things out.	O sọ pe o nilo akoko lati to nkan jade.
It has always been good for me.	O dara nigbagbogbo fun mi.
I agree.	Mo gba.
He said it was.	O sọ pe o jẹ.
We will not be long.	A ko ni gun.
All the children are there to help.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọde wa lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
The past is behind us.	Ohun ti o ti kọja wa lẹhin wa.
He dropped the word.	O ju ọrọ naa silẹ.
And almost all of it has elevated my life.	Ati pe o fẹrẹ jẹ pe gbogbo rẹ ti gbe igbesi aye mi ga.
Such a decision should not be made in a minute.	Iru ipinnu bẹẹ ko yẹ ki o ṣe ni iṣẹju kan.
What will happen to my hair.	Kini yoo ṣẹlẹ si irun mi.
This is a story for us.	Eyi jẹ itan fun wa.
But the reasons were interesting.	Ṣugbọn awọn idi wà awon.
Outside, the material is rotating.	Ni ita rẹ, ohun elo n yi.
It even has doors.	O paapaa ni ilẹkun.
This can.	Eyi le.
Understand what my friends will go through.	Loye ohun ti awọn ọrẹ mi yoo kọja.
I'm fast '.	Mo yara yara'.
It might be wise for him to be there.	O le jẹ oye fun u lati wa nibẹ.
He moved to the suburbs.	O gbe lọ si agbegbe ita.
You can't keep this from your parents.	O ko le pa eyi mọ lọwọ awọn obi rẹ.
He was angry.	O binu yẹn.
My father is dead.	Baba mi ti ku.
They become friends for life.	Wọn di ọrẹ fun igbesi aye.
This time he said so.	Ni akoko yii o sọ bẹ.
We will be back with you in a minute.	A yoo pada wa pẹlu rẹ ni iṣẹju kan.
Don't worry about it for the moment.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan nipa rẹ fun akoko naa.
I can't do it now.	Emi ko le ṣe ni bayi.
He created me.	O da mi.
It takes side roads.	O gba awọn opopona ẹgbẹ.
Of course, you keep whatever you write.	Dajudaju, o tọju ohunkohun ti o kọ.
The word is correct.	Ọrọ naa tọ.
I can’t let that happen.	Emi ko le jẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ.
No, that's not right.	Rara, iyẹn naa ko tọ.
Some people do it a lot of times.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ṣe ọpọlọpọ igba.
Look my way.	Wo ọna mi.
I know it’s getting better.	Mo mọ pe o ti n dara si.
And this, it turns out, is the problem.	Ati pe eyi, o wa ni jade, ni iṣoro naa.
So you called to ask.	Nitorina o pe lati beere.
Give us another minute.	Fun wa ni iṣẹju miiran.
The music was as loud as expected.	Orin ti ga julọ bi o ti ṣe yẹ.
But please, please come back tomorrow.	Ṣugbọn jọwọ, jọwọ pada wa ni ọla.
His head snapped back.	Ori rẹ ya pada.
Without a newspaper.	Laisi iwe iroyin.
You should measure them well.	O yẹ ki o wọn wọn daradara.
We hear what other people think.	A gbọ ohun ti awọn eniyan miiran ro.
Anything is possible there.	Ohunkohun ṣee ṣe nibẹ.
Let me know how it goes !.	Jẹ ki n mọ bi o ṣe lọ!.
But some are not so good to start even.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu awọn ko dara pupọ lati bẹrẹ paapaa.
But the information is good.	Ṣugbọn alaye naa dara.
We have nothing to eat.	A ko ni nkankan lati jẹ.
Lots of places.	Pupọ julọ awọn aaye.
The driver did not charge a fee, especially for a consultation.	Awakọ naa ko gba owo, paapaa fun imọran kan.
He was someone who could not help but love.	O jẹ ẹnikan ti o ko le ṣe iranlọwọ ṣugbọn fẹran.
Here they are.	Nibi ti won wa.
And that’s a high point.	Ati pe iyẹn ni aaye giga.
And it was their first time !.	Ati pe o jẹ akọkọ akọkọ wọn!.
That law has been repealed recently.	Ofin yẹn ti tun ṣe laipẹ.
And no one was told what he was working on.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti a sọ ohun ti o n ṣiṣẹ lori.
It helps me out.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi jade.
He had some difficulty understanding the question.	O ni iṣoro diẹ ninu oye ibeere naa.
He is still doing it.	O tun n ṣe.
I have a lot of questions about this.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere nipa eyi.
If you do not ask, you will be angry.	Ti o ko ba beere, iwọ yoo binu.
It started well enough.	O ti bẹrẹ daradara to.
I have to consider the price.	Mo ni lati ro ero owo naa.
Let me tell you a little about both.	Jẹ ki n sọ fun ọ diẹ nipa awọn mejeeji.
They made great plays behind me.	Wọn ṣe awọn ere nla lẹhin mi.
Hungry for about a year.	Ebi fun nipa odun kan.
This must be the point!	Eyi gbọdọ jẹ aaye naa!
You have a friend you like.	O ni ọrẹ kan ti o fẹ.
We all want to be good.	Gbogbo wa ni a fẹ lati dara.
This is the kind of thing mothers should do with.	Eyi ni iru ohun ti awọn iya yẹ lati ṣe pẹlu.
And possibly the word.	Ati pe o ṣee ṣe ọrọ naa.
Higher than that.	Ti o ga ju iyẹn lọ.
You are very beautiful.	O lẹwa pupọ.
I don’t know when you will be.	Emi ko mọ igba ti iwọ yoo jẹ.
She tried to take a picture of someone taking her children.	O gbiyanju lati ya aworan ẹnikan ti o mu awọn ọmọ rẹ lọ.
This will last forever.	Eleyi yoo gba lailai.
I will give you nothing.	Emi yoo fun ọ ni ohunkohun.
The word does not get.	Ọrọ naa ko gba.
What you start off, what you finish, start.	Ohun ti o bẹrẹ pari, kini o pari, bẹrẹ.
He had studied history in high school.	O ti kọ ẹkọ itan ni ile-iwe giga.
He loves her in every way.	O nifẹ rẹ ni gbogbo ọna.
And both should work together.	Ati awọn mejeeji yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ papọ.
I have no idea how to go about doing this.	Emi ko ni imọran bi o ṣe le lọ nipa ṣiṣe eyi.
Summer is my favorite time.	Ooru jẹ akoko ayanfẹ mi.
I look at your face.	Mo wo oju re.
No, you should not.	Rara, o yẹ ko.
This idea is very questionable.	Imọran yii jẹ ibeere pupọ.
I'm looking forward to it.	Oju n wo mi.
He did not remove it.	Ko gbe e kuro.
Your hand goes to your mouth.	Ọwọ rẹ lọ si ẹnu rẹ.
He quickly caught on fire.	O yara mu lori ina.
More details to come next day !.	Awọn alaye diẹ sii lati wa ni ọjọ miiran!.
Many boats go by sea every year.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkọ oju omi ti n lọ nipasẹ okun ni gbogbo ọdun.
This is also a mistake.	Eyi tun jẹ aṣiṣe.
The next minute it passed me.	Ni iṣẹju miiran o ti kọja kọja mi.
Not in a week.	Ko si ni ọsẹ kan.
It is good to meet them.	O dara ki o pade wọn.
Not because he had gone home.	Kii ṣe nitori pe o ti lọ si ile.
You just made a mistake.	O kan ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
Things are hard.	Awọn nkan jẹ lile.
You have me.	O ni mi.
Dogs are always a member of a family.	Awọn aja nigbagbogbo jẹ ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti idile kan.
If only the word.	Ti o ba jẹ pe ọrọ nikan ni.
O lu ina.	O lu ina.
There are good days and bad days.	Awọn ọjọ ti o dara ati awọn ọjọ buburu wa.
I did not look up.	Emi ko wo soke.
There are two reasons for this area of ​​uncertain information.	Awọn idi meji lo wa fun alaye agbegbe ko ni idaniloju.
Everyone rejoiced.	Gbogbo eniyan yọ.
He just doesn't like that tonight.	O kan ko fẹran iyẹn ni alẹ oni.
I would have loved.	Emi yoo ti fẹ.
People everywhere are becoming more and more concerned about the environment.	Awọn eniyan nibi gbogbo ti di aniyan diẹ sii nipa ayika.
He believes the rules will pass.	O gbagbọ pe awọn ofin yoo kọja.
Two groups go down and two go up.	Awọn ẹgbẹ meji lọ si isalẹ ati meji lọ soke.
It's done, he said.	O ti ṣe, o sọ.
And all his friends.	Ati gbogbo awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
It should be something.	O yẹ ki o jẹ nkan.
Her head hurts.	Ori re n dun.
I think this method will bring more stress than it should.	Mo ro pe ọna yii yoo mu wahala diẹ sii ju ti o tọ.
I can not do what they do.	Emi ko le ṣe ohun ti wọn ṣe.
Do not be afraid.	Maṣe bẹru.
If you want someone, tell them.	Ti o ba fẹ ẹnikan, sọ fun wọn.
Explain this to the men.	Ṣe alaye yii si awọn ọkunrin naa.
But that will not be long.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii yoo pẹ.
I just want to be better.	Mo kan fẹ lati dara julọ.
Work is expected to begin soon.	A nireti iṣẹ lati bẹrẹ laipẹ.
Men are better at problem solving than women.	Awọn ọkunrin dara julọ ni ipinnu iṣoro ju awọn obinrin lọ.
There is so much to do.	Ọpọlọpọ wa lati ṣe.
They will all be broken.	A o fọ gbogbo wọn.
A lu o.	A lu o.
He thought it was his father, and thought.	O ro pe baba rẹ ni, ati ero.
I think you are.	Mo ro pe o wa.
Let them kill each other.	Jẹ ki wọn pa ara wọn.
You have thought this through.	O ti ro eyi nipasẹ.
By groups.	Nipa awọn ẹgbẹ.
For more time, the work would have been completed.	Fun akoko diẹ sii, iṣẹ naa yoo ti pari.
Be the best you can be.	Jẹ awọn ti o dara ju ti o le jẹ.
Let me give you two suggestions.	Jẹ ki n fun ọ ni imọran meji.
Three weeks passed.	Ọsẹ mẹta kọja.
I don't think about that.	Emi ko ronu nipa iyẹn.
It does not appear to have any.	O ko han lati ni eyikeyi.
There is no word on what happened in this house.	Ko si ọrọ kan nipa ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni ile yii.
Best to wait.	Ti o dara ju lati duro.
I did not try to kill you.	Emi ko gbiyanju lati pa ọ.
They don't like that.	Wọn ko fẹran iyẹn.
You have completely missed the point.	O ti padanu aaye naa patapata.
Man cannot drink.	Eniyan ko le mu.
Make sure you have the right pair of shoes.	Rii daju pe o ni bata bata to dara.
I think you get it.	Mo ro pe o gba.
He is my father.	Baba mi ni.
Spend an hour or two.	Lo wakati kan tabi meji.
It's a big reason.	Idi nla ni.
It was a place to be seen.	O je ibi kan lati wa ni ri.
I'm glad to see it.	Inu mi dun lati ri i.
That’s what’s happening here.	Ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ nibi niyẹn.
Love works the same way.	Ifẹ ṣiṣẹ ni ọna kanna.
You don’t believe us.	O ko gbagbọ wa.
She also pulled her hair back from her face again.	O tun ti irun ori rẹ pada lati oju rẹ lẹẹkansi.
Nothing will be easier.	Ko si ohun ti yoo rọrun.
Not easy.	Ko rọrun.
They belong to her mother.	Wọn jẹ ti iya rẹ.
You have to see to believe !.	O ni lati rii lati gbagbọ!.
But how do they do that.	Ṣugbọn bawo ni wọn ṣe ṣe iyẹn.
It was purple, okay.	O je eleyi ti, o dara.
He will die.	A o ku.
He did the same thing.	O ṣe ohun kanna.
If this continues and I think it will.	Ti eyi ba tẹsiwaju ati pe Mo ro pe yoo.
They shouldn’t work, but they do.	Wọn ko yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ, ṣugbọn wọn ṣe.
You can use it to handle whatever you need.	O le lo lati mu ohunkohun ti o nilo.
I have never met him.	Emi ko tii pade rẹ rara.
This is a fixed point at the moment.	Eyi jẹ aaye ti o wa titi ni akoko.
He looked at the girl.	O wo ọmọbirin naa.
There are several reasons for this decision.	Awọn idi pupọ lo wa fun ipinnu yii.
Nothing makes me feel more alive.	Ko si ohun ti o mu mi lero diẹ laaye.
I mean, some time.	Mo tumọ si, diẹ ninu awọn akoko.
I need to go, and so on.	Mo nilo lati lọ, ati bẹ naa.
I worked on it.	Mo ti ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ.
Here, people must not try to think, they must feel.	Nibi, eniyan ko gbọdọ gbiyanju lati ronu, o gbọdọ lero.
Maybe he doesn’t even like himself.	Boya oun ko fẹran ara rẹ paapaa.
The question will be met.	Ibeere naa yoo pade.
I was afraid people would laugh at me.	Mo bẹru awọn eniyan yoo rẹrin si mi.
Go out for tea with a friend.	Jade fun tii pẹlu ọrẹ kan.
So did my father.	Bẹẹ ni baba mi ṣe.
You may not know that, but you do.	O le ma mọ iyẹn, ṣugbọn o ṣe.
Please can you help me with that.	Jọwọ ṣe o le ran mi lọwọ pẹlu iyẹn.
But we will bring some of our men with us.	Ṣugbọn a yoo mu diẹ ninu awọn ọkunrin wa pẹlu wa.
Not much, but a little.	Ko Elo, sugbon kekere kan.
Maybe you will grow to love it.	Boya o yoo dagba lati nifẹ rẹ.
We need to learn to communicate with each other.	A nilo lati kọ ẹkọ lati ba ara wa sọrọ.
He refused to look at me.	O kọ lati wo mi.
He played a lot of games on football.	O ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn ere lori bọọlu.
Wondering how it sounds, books can do that for you.	Iyalẹnu bi o ṣe n dun, awọn iwe le ṣe iyẹn fun ọ.
To be or not to be, that is the question.	Lati jẹ tabi kii ṣe, ibeere naa niyẹn.
You know the best times to get people to talk.	O mọ awọn akoko ti o dara julọ lati gba eniyan lati sọrọ.
I have thought long and hard about it.	Mo ti ronu gun ati lile nipa rẹ.
You know what’s under it now.	O mọ ohun ti o wa labẹ rẹ ni bayi.
It’s something that’s unconvincing.	O jẹ nkankan ti ko ba ni idaniloju.
But obviously they knew he was looking for my car.	Ṣugbọn o han gbangba wọn mọ pe o n wa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi.
I felt my mother's hand around me.	Mo ro ọwọ iya mi ni ayika mi.
That you know me better than anyone.	Pe o mọ mi ju ẹnikẹni lọ.
Or apo.	Tabi apo.
Let us not waste any more time.	Jẹ ki a maṣe fi akoko nu diẹ sii.
And her husband.	Ati ọkọ rẹ.
You can also get the car.	O tun le gba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
Both sides will agree that they are.	Awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji yoo gba pe wọn jẹ.
Not much for me.	Kii ṣe pupọ fun mi.
Maybe you have been married for many years.	Boya o ti ṣe igbeyawo fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
You can see what he did to her.	O le wo ohun ti o ṣe si i.
But that doesn’t mean he can’t handle himself.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko tumọ si pe ko le mu ara rẹ mu.
Whatever happens, everyone knows about it.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ, gbogbo eniyan mọ nipa rẹ.
Do not drink it.	Maṣe mu u.
I love that about it.	Mo nifẹ iyẹn nipa rẹ.
I can't see it.	Nko le wo e.
I am growing up to love this place.	Mo n dagba lati nifẹ ibi yii.
You need to attend the meeting.	O nilo lati lọ si ipade naa.
This is always the question of the obvious person.	Eyi nigbagbogbo jẹ ibeere ti eniyan ti o han gbangba.
But it is also very hot.	Ṣugbọn o tun gbona pupọ.
Just call me, to let me know.	O kan pe mi, lati jẹ ki mi mọ.
We are the first.	A jẹ akọkọ.
The company is growing.	Ile-iṣẹ n dagba.
Don't tell me.	Maṣe sọ fun mi.
She hopes to buy a big house.	O nireti lati ra ile nla kan.
Now you know my position.	Bayi o mọ ipo mi.
Tell me about the situation.	Sọ fun mi nipa ipo naa.
It may or may not be for educational purposes only.	O le tabi ko le jẹ fun awọn idi ẹkọ nikan.
You must promise me that you will not go.	O gbọdọ ṣe ileri fun mi pe iwọ kii yoo lọ.
We should stay together, remember?	O yẹ ki a duro papọ, ranti?
It is your car.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ ni.
Is this.	Ṣe eyi.
Do not borrow money from anyone.	Maṣe ya owo fun ẹnikẹni.
These people helped to reform the system.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi ṣe iranlọwọ lati tun eto naa ṣe.
Nothing really important.	Ko si ohun ti gan pataki.
The best way.	Ọna ti o dara julọ.
You are not with us.	Iwọ ko wa pẹlu wa.
But there are problems.	Ṣugbọn awọn iṣoro wa.
They do not have and they will not.	Wọn ko ni ati pe wọn kii yoo.
We always took our trip.	Nigbagbogbo a gba irin-ajo wa.
It will change forever.	Yi o pada lailai.
They think it is wrong.	Wọn ro pe ko tọ.
We are trying to imagine what went through your mind.	A n gbiyanju lati ro ero ohun ti o lọ nipasẹ ọkan rẹ.
We have eaten for you.	A ti jẹ fun ọ.
It is my time now.	O jẹ akoko mi bayi.
When you come pick it up.	Nigbati o ba wa gbe e.
Power in children.	Agbara ninu awọn ọmọde.
That’s not a big deal, either.	Iyẹn kii ṣe adehun nla, boya.
However, there is a problem.	Sibẹsibẹ, iṣoro kan wa.
He will take care of the little one.	Oun yoo tọju ọmọ kekere naa.
I am not a person and everyone.	Emi kii ṣe ẹnikan ati gbogbo eniyan.
I need to improve this for tomorrow.	Mo nilo lati mu eyi dara si fun ọla.
Where it will not be possible to stay.	Ibi ti kii yoo ṣee ṣe lati duro.
What do you say ?.	Kini o sọ?.
I saw it.	Mo ri e.
I am in a good position.	Mo wa ni ipo ti o dara.
I thought so.	Mo ro o.
The picture is beautiful.	Aworan naa lẹwa.
Everyone is looking down.	Gbogbo eniyan n wo isalẹ.
There they sat for another week.	Nibẹ ni wọn joko ni ọsẹ miiran.
His opinion could not be further clarified.	Ero rẹ ko le ṣe alaye diẹ sii.
I am not sure they are there.	Emi ko da wọn loju pe wọn wa nibẹ.
I will not stop.	Nko da a duro.
That is why.	Idi niyẹn.
To make everyone forget it.	Lati jẹ ki gbogbo eniyan gbagbe rẹ.
But they do not want you to know their opinion.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko fẹ ki o mọ ero wọn.
You will be amazed at the details you never noticed.	Iwọ yoo jẹ ohun iyanu ni awọn alaye ti o ko ṣe akiyesi rara.
You will not have a long career.	Iwọ kii yoo ni iṣẹ pipẹ.
I would hate to miss it.	Emi yoo korira lati padanu rẹ.
No one knows what is happening.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
This work is important and vital.	Iṣẹ yii jẹ pataki ati pataki.
I just like these.	Mo kan fẹran awọn wọnyi.
A woman sitting under a tree.	Obinrin kan ti o joko labẹ igi.
In fact, they are here.	Ni otitọ, wọn wa nibi.
Nothing easy.	Ko si ohun ti o rọrun.
Such a clean thing.	Iru nkan ti o mọ.
This amazing room.	Yara iyalẹnu yii.
It may be a year before you have your dog.	O le jẹ ọdun kan ṣaaju ki o to ni aja rẹ.
It’s not how you believe it should be.	Kii ṣe bi o ṣe gbagbọ pe o yẹ ki o jẹ.
It could not have been 30 minutes.	Ko le ti jẹ ọgbọn iṣẹju.
This is a very surprising idea.	Eyi jẹ imọran iyalẹnu pupọ.
You do not need it.	O ko nilo rẹ.
That is true, it happens all the time.	Iyẹn jẹ otitọ, o ṣẹlẹ ni gbogbo igba.
The power.	Agbara naa.
There are also two.	Meji tun wa.
And even my mother seems to like it.	Ati paapaa iya mi dabi pe o fẹran rẹ.
But, boy, did you do it.	Ṣugbọn, ọmọkunrin, o ṣe ọ.
Their rules are outdated.	Ofin wọn jẹ igba atijọ.
I will not do that.	Emi kii yoo ṣe iyẹn.
He did not speak small.	O ko sọrọ kekere.
I don’t know how to explain how everything works.	Emi ko mọ lati ṣe alaye bi ohun gbogbo ṣe ṣiṣẹ.
It can last a long time in bad weather.	O le pẹ diẹ ni oju ojo ko dara.
But nothing stopped them.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o da wọn duro.
They are off books.	Wọn ti wa ni pa awọn iwe ohun.
Look.	Wo.
This is my favorite song.	Eyi ni orin ayanfẹ mi.
He’s saying something.	O n sọ nkan kan.
Children do not learn this way.	Awọn ọmọde ko kọ ẹkọ ni ọna yii.
He stayed there for two seasons.	O duro nibẹ fun awọn akoko meji.
He has never been able to reveal himself.	Ko ti le fi ara rẹ han rara.
You are deciding something.	O n pinnu ohun kan.
But this is not enough.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko pe.
His head has already been cut off.	A ti ge ori rẹ tẹlẹ.
Meetings should not take place.	Ipade ko yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
Know what they were talking about.	Mọ ohun ti won ni won sọrọ nipa.
Often, there is something you want to do with the project.	Nigbagbogbo, ohun kan wa ti o fẹ ṣe pẹlu iṣẹ naa.
This will not be possible one day either.	Eyi kii yoo ṣee ṣe ni ọjọ kan boya.
Okay, at least it’s something to think about.	O dara, o kere ju o jẹ nkan lati ronu nipa.
Life is like an unfinished school.	Igbesi aye dabi ile-iwe ti ko pari.
My room is now.	Yara mi ni bayi.
But it is for a while.	Sugbon o jẹ fun igba diẹ.
I don’t want them to see me like this.	Emi ko fẹ ki wọn ri mi bi eleyi.
You won't be able to get out tonight.	Iwọ kii yoo ni anfani lati jade ni alẹ oni.
At this point the trial fee begins.	Ni aaye yii owo idanwo naa bẹrẹ.
But the question is powerless.	Ṣugbọn ibeere naa ko ni agbara.
People will have to get out of their way.	Awọn eniyan yoo ni lati jade kuro ni ọna wọn.
Everyone knew that, and everyone knew at that time.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ iyẹn, ati pe gbogbo eniyan mọ ni akoko yẹn.
I have nothing to do.	Emi ko ni nkan lati ṣe.
It may be the best thing you can be.	O le jẹ ohun ti o dara julọ ti o le jẹ.
Until then, he would drink one day at a time.	Titi di igba naa, oun yoo mu ni ọjọ kan ni akoko kan.
And some of these new homes look great.	Ati pe diẹ ninu awọn ile tuntun wọnyi dabi dara julọ.
He does not like us.	Ko fẹran wa.
At first it looked kind of good.	Ni akọkọ o dabi iru ti o dara.
I like to work hard and play hard.	Mo fẹ lati ṣiṣẹ lile ati ki o mu le.
We have to move.	A ni lati gbe.
You will not be in it long enough.	Iwọ kii yoo wa ninu rẹ pẹ to.
Already home, have already seen what is in my bed.	Tẹlẹ ile, ti rii ohun ti o wa ninu ibusun mi tẹlẹ.
No more, they continue to talk.	Ko si diẹ, wọn tẹsiwaju lati sọrọ.
I would be happy to come home.	Inu mi yoo dun lati de ile.
It looks like it's on the way.	O dabi ẹni pe o wa lori ọna.
I dread it a lot.	Mo bẹru rẹ pupọ.
I love my brother very much.	Mo nifẹ arakunrin mi pupọ.
I haven’t done it yet.	Emi ko ṣe sibẹsibẹ.
It does not hurt much.	O ko ni ipalara pupọ.
But only for a short time.	Ṣugbọn nikan fun igba diẹ.
He would talk, or not talk, to his wife at dinner.	Oun yoo sọrọ, tabi ko sọrọ, si iyawo rẹ ni ounjẹ alẹ.
You can feel but you can not see.	O le lero ṣugbọn o ko le rii.
I have this.	Mo ni eyi.
And the same goes for everyone else.	Ati pe kanna n lọ fun gbogbo eniyan miiran.
Here you go.	Nibi lọ.
We went to my sister for dinner.	A lọ si arabinrin mi fun ounjẹ alẹ.
It would have been great.	Yoo ti jẹ nla.
Get your energy back.	Gba agbara rẹ pada.
She didn’t hit him with it.	O ko lu u pẹlu rẹ.
He wanted to see the world.	O fe lati ri aye.
However, this may change to your advantage.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi le yipada si anfani rẹ.
We tell you a story.	A sọ itan kan fun ọ.
However they are here.	Sibẹsibẹ wọn wa nibi.
This season is over.	Akoko yi ti pari.
You can not say anything.	O ko le sọ ohunkohun.
We need to make sure this does not happen again.	A nilo lati rii daju pe eyi ko ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
He was great.	O si jẹ nla.
The students are a really good team.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe jẹ ẹgbẹ ti o dara gaan.
This is how it works.	Eyi ni bii o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
Sold out completely, you have to.	Ti ta jade patapata, o ni.
But at least he was alive.	Sugbon o kere o wa laaye.
It makes everyone happy and it shouldn’t be.	O ni inu gbogbo eniyan dun ati pe ko yẹ.
Your hand, your big hand.	Ọwọ rẹ, ọwọ nla rẹ.
It is not a game.	Kii ṣe ere kan.
It was the best day of his life.	O jẹ ọjọ ti o dara julọ ti igbesi aye rẹ.
It will not stop.	Ko ni duro.
I have enough for both.	Mo ni to fun awọn mejeeji.
He can't do that right now.	Ko le ṣe iyẹn ni bayi.
It brings you back.	O mu ọ pada.
Nothing appears yet.	Ko si ohun ti o han sibẹsibẹ.
I did not give him my hand.	Emi ko fun u ni ọwọ mi.
And there was more trouble.	Ati nibẹ wà diẹ wahala.
And age is not a real issue.	Ati ọjọ ori kii ṣe ọrọ kan gaan.
I did not come to your house and do it for you.	Emi ko wa si ile rẹ ki o ṣe fun ọ.
That means of course.	Eyi tumọ si dajudaju.
By driving, that's right.	Nipa awakọ, iyẹn tọ.
Only get your name.	Gba orukọ rẹ nikan.
They have to carry smaller items.	Wọn gbọdọ gbe awọn nkan ti o kere si.
However, there is nothing real in life.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko si ohun ti o daju ni igbesi aye.
I try to play better.	Mo gbiyanju lati mu ṣiṣẹ dara.
He asked me to wait for a picture.	O beere fun mi lati duro fun aworan kan.
There you go.	Nibẹ ti o lọ.
All anyone has to do is try.	Gbogbo enikeni ni lati se ni gbiyanju.
It was the first time there.	O jẹ igba akọkọ ti o wa nibẹ.
No one in my company knows about it, either.	Ko si ẹnikan ninu ile-iṣẹ mi ti o mọ nipa rẹ, paapaa.
I will never make the same mistake again.	Emi kii yoo ṣe aṣiṣe kanna lẹẹkansi.
Neither allowed.	Bẹni ko gba laaye.
Someone is not very tall.	Ẹnikan ko ga pupọ.
The man leaned back in his seat.	Ọkunrin naa pada sẹhin ni ijoko rẹ.
No one went.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o lọ.
So to speak.	Nitorina lati sọrọ.
If you want to work, it works.	Ti o ba fẹ ṣiṣẹ, o ṣiṣẹ.
I taught myself to sound like this.	Mo kọ ara mi lati dun bi eleyi.
Why not read these books.	Kilode ti o ko ka awọn iwe wọnyi.
This is your only life.	Eleyi jẹ rẹ nikan aye.
And he has no wife, something he wants more than anything else.	Ati pe ko ni obinrin, nkan ti o fẹ ju ohunkohun miiran lọ.
The sister was nice to us because she wanted to.	Arabinrin naa dara si wa nitori o fẹ.
It takes time to look her in the eye.	O gba akoko lati wo oju rẹ.
They will make you new.	Wọn yoo sọ ọ di tuntun.
He took the box to work.	O mu apoti lati ṣiṣẹ.
It has added a lot of food for thought.	O ti fi ọpọlọpọ ounjẹ kun fun ero.
How do you sleep?	Bawo ni o ṣe sun?
I should find a job that interests me.	Mo yẹ ki o wa iṣẹ ti o nifẹ si mi.
There are less than yesterday.	Nibẹ ni o wa kere ju lana.
But it seems to do well.	Ṣugbọn o dabi pe o ṣe daradara.
They should not sleep together completely.	Wọn ko yẹ ki wọn sun papọ patapata.
Your body is not good.	Ara ara re ko dara.
If no name, no name needed.	Ti ko ba si orukọ, ko si orukọ ti a nilo.
Now, think of it this way.	Bayi, ronu nipa rẹ ni ọna yii.
It is a small world.	O ti wa ni a kekere aye.
Surprise is good.	Iyalẹnu jẹ dara.
Maybe he didn’t, maybe, he was your friend.	Boya o ko ṣe, boya, o jẹ ọrẹ rẹ.
Feel free to contact me.	Lero lati kan si mi.
It is not a field of art.	Kii ṣe aaye ti aworan.
It makes you want more.	O jẹ ki o fẹ diẹ sii.
Now let’s get back to it.	Bayi jẹ ki a pada si ọdọ rẹ.
There is a problem.	Iṣoro kan lo wa.
However their children could not continue.	Sibẹsibẹ awọn ọmọ wọn ko le tẹsiwaju.
I do not understand young people.	Emi ko loye awọn ọdọ.
They left the company.	Wọn fi ile-iṣẹ silẹ.
Not just your heart.	Kii ṣe ọkan rẹ nikan.
But the child did not come.	Ṣugbọn ọmọ ko wa.
The condition is serious for the doctor.	Ipo naa ṣe pataki fun dokita.
But he could not stop it.	Sugbon ko le da o.
He said they would.	O sọ pe wọn yoo.
But that’s not the life you want anymore.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe igbesi aye ti o fẹ mọ.
All work associated with this is done.	Gbogbo iṣẹ ti o ni nkan ṣe pẹlu eyi ni a ṣe.
And this is information and question.	Ati pe eyi ni alaye ati ibeere.
You or he may have a job.	Iwọ tabi o le ni iṣẹ kan.
It is not a system that will help them.	Kii ṣe eto ti yoo ran wọn lọwọ.
That was every three weeks ago.	Iyẹn jẹ gbogbo ọsẹ mẹta sẹhin.
It's completely gone.	O ti lọ patapata.
Would love such things.	Yoo fẹ iru awọn nkan bẹẹ.
And some of us, of course.	Ati pe diẹ ninu wa, dajudaju.
They’re trying to stop it.	Wọn n gbiyanju lati da pada.
Not a man.	Ko ọkunrin.
I got up to drive my space.	Mo dide lati wakọ aaye mi.
Do not force them, ask them.	Maṣe fi agbara mu wọn, beere lọwọ wọn.
She hopes her children understand.	O nireti pe awọn ọmọ rẹ loye.
We are entering a new age.	A n wọ ọjọ ori tuntun kan.
No one will tell me why.	Ko si ọkan yoo so fun mi idi ti.
Remember to lock any door you receive.	Ranti lati ti ilẹkun eyikeyi ti o gba.
And we are not there.	Ati pe a ko wa nibẹ.
It needs to be done now.	O nilo lati ṣe ni bayi.
But if you want, we can start again.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba fẹ, a le bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
It is used to start early.	O ti lo lati bẹrẹ ni kutukutu.
I don't like that.	Emi ko fẹran iyẹn.
Locked the door!	Ti ilẹkun!
Raise your hand over your head.	Gbe ọwọ rẹ soke lori ori rẹ.
This time it changed, but the door did not open.	Ni akoko yii o yipada, ṣugbọn ilẹkun ko ṣii.
I enjoy myself.	Mo gbadun ara mi.
Let it be there and feel.	Jẹ ki o wa nibẹ ki o lero.
Of course it is better that they be.	Dajudaju o dara julọ ki wọn jẹ.
You have two problems.	O ni awọn iṣoro meji.
A member of the tour took the picture.	Ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti irin-ajo naa ya aworan naa.
I'm glad you're not me.	Inu mi dun pe iwọ ni kii ṣe emi.
It's iron.	O ni irin ni.
Why do they eat so much?	Kini idi ti wọn jẹun pupọ?
That ended that little problem.	Iyẹn pari iṣoro kekere yẹn.
What happened in the body does not want you there anymore.	Ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni ara ko fẹ o wa nibẹ mọ.
I will meet you.	Emi yoo pade yin.
For all of you.	Fun gbogbo re.
However, most of what we need is around us.	Sibẹsibẹ, pupọ julọ ohun ti a nilo wa ni ayika wa.
It is very close.	O wa nitosi pupọ.
For me, this word is not very simple.	Fun mi, ọrọ yii ko rọrun pupọ.
I am here to remove them.	Mo wa nibi lati yọ wọn kuro.
The story of my life.	Itan aye mi.
Everyone does bad things.	Gbogbo eniyan ṣe ohun buburu.
But this is my problem.	Ṣugbọn wahala mi ni eyi.
I look at them hard.	Mo wo wọn lile.
However it still does not work.	Sibẹsibẹ o tun ko ṣiṣẹ.
About a week late.	Bi ọsẹ kan pẹ.
You can do this in several ways.	O le ṣe eyi ni awọn ọna pupọ.
Many questions are asked.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere ni a beere.
Men and women in the field love this.	Awọn ọkunrin ati awọn obinrin ni aaye fẹran eyi.
Look at my cats!	Wo ologbo mi!
They are afraid.	Wọn bẹru.
Children have to go to school.	Awọn ọmọde ni lati lọ si ile-iwe.
We have moved.	A ti gbe.
You want to know where your child is.	O fẹ lati mọ ibi ti ọmọ rẹ wa.
The world is your friend can doubt just a little.	Awọn aye jẹ ọrẹ rẹ le ṣiyemeji o kan diẹ.
And it grew a lot.	Ati pe o dagba pupọ.
Hunger is not enough to eat.	Ebi ko ni to lati je.
Of course not there.	Dajudaju ko si nibẹ.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	O dabi ojo gbona.
It doesn't really help.	Ko ṣe iranlọwọ gaan.
I am your sister.	Arabinrin re ni mi.
For a while nothing said.	Fun kan nigba ti ohunkohun ko so.
I think you will find this book interesting.	Mo ro pe o yoo ri iwe yi awon.
She tried to think of something else.	O gbiyanju lati ronu nipa nkan miiran.
And maybe there are people too.	Ati boya eniyan tun wa.
Don’t just use pictures to stick out.	Ma ṣe lo awọn aworan nikan lati so jade.
Many of them are afraid.	Pupọ ninu wọn bẹru.
I am most of it.	Mo jẹ julọ ninu rẹ.
You can cut it back.	O le ge rẹ pada.
I mean, the baby is not there.	Mo tumọ si, ọmọ naa ko ti wa nibẹ.
We have been through fire before.	A ti wa nipasẹ ina ṣaaju ki o to.
And maybe it is.	Ati boya o jẹ.
Their eyes widened as they stood out loud.	Oju wọn ti yọ kuro bi wọn ti duro jade pupọ.
I do not really understand that.	Emi ko loye iyẹn gaan.
I know you are.	Mo mọ pe o wa.
You want to wear the same outfit every week.	O fẹ wọ aṣọ kanna ni gbogbo ọsẹ.
I can be sure this is happening.	Mo le rii daju pe eyi n ṣẹlẹ.
They come back, but things are not good.	Wọn pada wa, ṣugbọn awọn nkan ko dara.
Not on what will happen to you after you want to finish.	Ko lori ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ si o lẹhin ti o fẹ pari.
We can do this at a fixed point in time.	A le ṣe eyi ni aaye ti o wa titi ni akoko.
I am convinced that.	O da mi loju pe.
We believe this is not possible.	A gbagbọ pe eyi ko le ṣee ṣe.
I want my school to feel like home.	Mo fe ki ile-iwe mi lero bi ile.
Nothing you can say or do will help him or her.	Ko si ohun ti o le sọ tabi ṣe yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun u tabi yi i pada.
This will help you to understand them and learn from them.	Eyi yoo ran ọ lọwọ lati loye wọn ati kọ ẹkọ lati ọdọ wọn.
The city has an old mansion.	Ilu naa ni ile nla atijọ kan.
They started to hit the front door.	Wọn bẹrẹ si kan ilẹkun iwaju.
I also stand by that statement.	Mo tun duro nipa ọrọ yẹn.
Do not cross your legs.	Maṣe kọja ẹsẹ rẹ.
One thought was as follows.	Ọkan ero wà bi wọnyi.
Let me do it again.	Jẹ ki n tun ṣe.
It can not rain much.	O ko le ti ojo Elo.
You are not waiting for your father or your wife.	Iwọ ko duro de baba tabi iyawo rẹ.
For now, it's all over.	Fun bayi, gbogbo rẹ ti pari.
You should do something with it. 	O yẹ ki o ṣe nkan pẹlu rẹ. 
Face to face.	Oju si oju.
Let me hear.	Jẹ ki n gbọ.
Look at your feet.	Wo ẹsẹ rẹ.
This will be my job.	Eyi yoo jẹ iṣẹ mi.
And you know it well.	Ati ki o mọ rẹ daradara.
Kill with your head!	Pa pẹlu ori rẹ!
I told the story in error.	Mo sọ itan naa ni aṣiṣe.
Others seem new.	Awọn miiran dabi ẹni tuntun.
I try to get them to stop.	Mo gbiyanju lati gba wọn lati da.
It is very difficult to understand us.	O nira julọ lati loye wa.
I just want to make sure what it is.	Mo kan fẹ lati rii daju pe ohun ti o jẹ.
It's late.	O pẹ wakati.
Would you please go outside?	Jọwọ ṣe iwọ yoo jade ni ita?
I would really like to see that.	Emi yoo fẹ gaan lati rii iyẹn.
This may be the first of its kind.	Eyi le jẹ akọkọ ti iru rẹ.
Well it used to be.	Daradara o lo lati wa ni.
Nothing to say.	Ko si ohun ti o sọ.
He believed she was another woman.	O gbagbọ pe obinrin miiran ni.
He revealed himself to the police.	O fi ara rẹ han si ọlọpa.
He never asked to be taken care of.	Ko beere rara lati tọju rẹ.
We just have to stay in the car.	A kan ni lati duro ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
That way, it seems obvious.	Ni ọna yẹn, o dabi ẹni pe o han gbangba.
We are used to.	A ti lo si.
We will be better off.	A yoo dara julọ.
She quickly looked at me, without a word.	O yara wo mi, laisi ọrọ kan.
So they come with everything.	Nitorina wọn wa pẹlu ohun gbogbo.
The sister is happy.	Arabinrin naa dun.
I turned to go back.	Mo yipada lati pada.
I was in my clothes again for the first time.	Mo wa ninu aṣọ mi lẹẹkansi fun igba akọkọ.
We will not let that happen.	A ko ni jẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ.
Age is found to be the most important.	Ọjọ ori ni a rii pe o ṣe pataki julọ.
I brought one out.	Mo mu ọkan jade.
All over now.	Gbogbo lori bayi.
But my mother did not want to.	Ṣugbọn iya mi ko fẹ.
In most cases, it is best to spend the right amount of time.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba, o dara julọ lati lo akoko ti o tọ.
This house will become, one day, old.	Ile yii yoo di, ni ọjọ kan, atijọ.
He will not see anything else.	Oun ko ni wo ohunkohun miiran.
This may be easier for some people than others.	Eyi le rọrun fun diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ju awọn miiran lọ.
Something similar exists in the works.	Nkankan iru wa ninu awọn iṣẹ.
I should go back.	Mo yẹ ki o pada.
Just look at me.	O kan wo mi.
I didn't see anything.	Emi ko wo nkankan gaan.
No one stopped everything.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o da ohun gbogbo duro.
Are you sure you will not tell him?	Ṣe o da ọ loju pe iwọ kii yoo sọ fun u.
There are three possible reasons.	Nibẹ ni o wa mẹta ṣee ṣe idi.
I believe things are happening for a reason.	Mo gbagbọ pe awọn nkan n ṣẹlẹ fun idi kan.
Picture a woman.	Aworan obinrin.
I know this is true.	Mo mọ pe eyi jẹ otitọ.
It has a way of making people laugh.	O ni ọna lati mu ki eniyan rẹrin.
We are in one now.	A wa ninu ọkan ni bayi.
Please, just give them whatever money you can.	Jọwọ, kan fun wọn ohunkohun ti owo ti o le.
But it's good.	Sugbon o dara.
He did not tell me why.	Ko so fun mi idi.
We can be so.	A le jẹ bẹ.
History will remember it.	Itan yoo ranti rẹ.
For a few months it could not work.	Fun awọn oṣu diẹ ko le ṣiṣẹ.
Doing a great job with people you know.	Ṣiṣe iṣẹ ti o dara julọ pẹlu awọn eniyan ti o mọ.
They identify people they know.	Wọn da awọn eniyan ti wọn mọ.
You need one.	O nilo ọkan.
He lost his job when the company relocated offices.	O padanu iṣẹ rẹ nigbati ile-iṣẹ tun gbe awọn ọfiisi pada.
He locked the door.	O ti ilẹkun.
Her sister hurried off the road.	Arabinrin rẹ yara lọ kuro ni ọna.
How can you let him do that? '	Bawo ni o ṣe le jẹ ki o ṣe eyi?'.
We are teaching our dogs to play football.	A n kọ awọn aja wa lati mu awọn bọọlu.
In more hands.	Ni ọwọ diẹ sii.
This dress wants to hold no space at all.	Aṣọ yii fẹ lati mu awọn aye kankan rara.
This may be over.	Eyi le ti pari.
The two brothers are best friends	Awọn arakunrin meji jẹ ọrẹ to dara julọ
Place the box on the bed in the room.	Gbe apoti lori ibusun ni yara.
It is a plan.	Eto kan ni.
The three months of the year are the best.	Oṣu mẹta ti ọdun ni o dara julọ.
Stories really live.	Awọn itan gbe gaan.
Not to be, of course.	Ko lati jẹ, dajudaju.
He waited for a few minutes.	O duro fun iṣẹju diẹ.
We have to think that way.	A ni lati ronu ni ọna yẹn.
He could not help himself.	Ko le ran ara rẹ lọwọ.
We have a little history.	A ni itan diẹ.
And yet one must be able to do.	Ati sibẹsibẹ ọkan gbọdọ ni anfani lati ṣe.
I enjoyed the work.	Mo gbadun iṣẹ naa.
The box will come.	Apoti yoo wa.
I wish this would break.	Mo fẹ pe eyi yoo fọ.
I need to go see it.	Mo nilo lati lọ ri i.
We can not, we will not change anyone.	A ko le, a ko ni yi ẹnikẹni pada.
For me, this is the best kind of surprise available.	Fun mi, eyi ni iru iyalẹnu ti o dara julọ ti o wa.
I think he did because of his position.	Mo ro pe o ṣe nitori ipo rẹ.
One, and he has grown so far.	Ọkan, o si ti dagba to bayi.
He raised his eyes a little.	O gbe oju rẹ soke diẹ diẹ.
Pay the bill.	San owo naa.
What do you want to ask me?	Kini o fẹ beere lọwọ mi?
We have no food, so we cannot give you any food.	A ko ni ounjẹ, nitorina a ko le fun ọ ni ounjẹ kan.
There are no job vacancies for high school students.	Ko si awọn aye iṣẹ fun awọn ọmọ ile-iwe giga.
You can not do me.	O ko le ṣe mi.
Have you read that book?	Njẹ o ti ka iwe yẹn?
This in itself is not surprising.	Eyi funrararẹ kii ṣe iyalẹnu.
Groups with something to say.	Awọn ẹgbẹ pẹlu nkan lati sọ.
I have done really well in the last ones.	Mo ti ṣe gan daradara ninu awọn ti o kẹhin.
He came behind my head, and pulled me up by my hair.	O de lẹhin ori mi, ki o si fa mi soke nipa irun mi.
What are you wondering about that ???.	Kini o jẹ iyalẹnu nipa iyẹn???.
It will probably be late again.	O ṣee ṣe pe yoo pẹ lẹẹkansi.
You’re taking a break from school, it’s as simple as that.	O n gba isinmi lati ile-iwe, o rọrun bi iyẹn.
This is on fire.	Eleyi jẹ lori ina.
One day there was a big rain.	Ni ojo kan ojo nla kan wa.
I didn’t have a book and they started talking.	Emi ko ni iwe ati pe wọn bẹrẹ lati ba sọrọ.
We do not know what to do.	A ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
There is no word for anyone on these things.	Ko si ọrọ kan fun ẹnikẹni nipa nkan wọnyi.
And see how he came back to her.	Ati ki o wo bi o ti pada si ọdọ rẹ.
However, an error occurred along the way.	Sibẹsibẹ, aṣiṣe kan ti wọ ni ọna.
We are very much on board.	A wa pupọ lori ọkọ.
The problem does not seem to be physical.	Iṣoro naa ko dabi pe o jẹ ti ara.
He plans to leave, as soon as possible.	O gbero lati lọ kuro, ni kete bi o ti ṣee.
Tell your father.	Sọ fun baba rẹ.
They need love.	Wọn nilo ifẹ.
Just lower your head and work harder.	O kan gbe ori rẹ silẹ o si ṣiṣẹ le.
But that does not mean that every woman does.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko tumọ si pe gbogbo obinrin ni o ṣe.
It should be beautiful.	O yẹ ki o lẹwa.
In this case there is only one condition.	Ni idi eyi ipo kan nikan ni o wa.
Life is changing again.	Igbesi aye n yipada lẹẹkansi.
So, friends learn from each other.	Nitorina, awọn ọrẹ kọ ẹkọ lati ọdọ ara wọn.
Do nothing or try to let it go.	Maṣe ṣe ohunkohun tabi gbiyanju lati jẹ ki o lọ.
He gave me away.	O fun mi kuro.
We need to get rid of those small groups.	A nilo lati mu awọn ẹgbẹ kekere naa kuro.
How wonderful, you can say.	Bawo ni iyanu, o le sọ.
He wants to do it to you.	O fẹ lati ṣe si ọ.
Do you eat them? 	Ṣe o jẹ wọn?
he asked.	o beere.
He really liked it.	O feran re gaan.
Now we can not know.	Bayi a ko le mọ.
Good by me.	O dara nipasẹ mi.
When you get home.	Nigbati o de ile.
I know you, right now.	Mo mọ ọ, ni bayi.
So we stopped more.	Nitorina a duro diẹ sii.
The girls agreed.	Awọn ọmọbirin gba.
And that didn’t help him much.	Ati pe iyẹn ko ṣe iranlọwọ fun u pupọ.
But most people do not.	Ṣugbọn ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan ko ṣe.
This increases their business.	Eleyi mu ki wọn owo.
We were used to this.	A ni won lo lati yi.
We know them.	A mọ wọn jẹ.
Don’t let a question lift you up.	Ma ṣe jẹ ki ibeere kan gbe ọ soke.
Well, more power for them.	O dara, agbara diẹ sii fun wọn.
Nothing.	Ko si ohun to.
I’m not sure we even know what that is.	Emi ko ni idaniloju pe a paapaa mọ kini iyẹn.
You feel high.	O lero ga.
And in a way much more than that.	Ati ni ọna pupọ diẹ sii ju eyi lọ.
You get all the information with little difficulty.	O gba gbogbo alaye naa pẹlu iṣoro diẹ.
If you are.	Ti o ba ti wa.
Nor is it the time of day you want.	Tabi kii ṣe akoko ti ọjọ ti o fẹ.
If nothing else, jump there.	Ti ko ba si ohun miiran, fo nibẹ.
There are so many cars, so many new homes.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ pupọ wa, ọpọlọpọ awọn ile tuntun.
They told me their story.	Wọn sọ itan wọn fun mi.
And there is only one that is more important.	Ati pe ọkan nikan wa ti o ṣe pataki julọ.
When you see why this happens, let us know.	Nigbati o ba rii idi ti eyi fi ṣẹlẹ, jẹ ki a mọ.
We have these important ideas to keep to one.	A ni awọn ero pataki wọnyi lati tọju si ọkan.
Live your new life.	Gbe igbesi aye tuntun rẹ.
But when you know better you try to do well.	Ṣugbọn nigbati o ba mọ dara julọ o gbiyanju lati ṣe daradara.
I am a local.	Mo jẹ agbegbe kan.
That was a year ago.	Eyi ni ọdun kan sẹhin.
It was not any trouble.	O je ko eyikeyi wahala.
Think about two years ago.	Ronu nipa ọdun meji sẹhin.
He thought such a thing would happen.	O ro pe iru nkan bẹẹ yoo ṣẹlẹ.
That’s good, we have some of them too.	Iyẹn dara, a ni diẹ ninu wọn paapaa.
Like, more than like, like.	Bii, diẹ sii ju bii, fẹran.
He was sure he did.	O ni idaniloju pe o ṣe.
One does not remember.	Kan ko ranti.
Yet another way to look.	Sibẹsibẹ ọna miiran lati wo.
It is nearby.	O wa nitosi.
They are outside the law.	Wọn wa ni ita ofin.

Cars parked on both sides of the road.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o duro ni ẹgbẹ mejeeji ti ọna naa.
No one was made.	Ko si ọkan ti a ṣe.

A few more minutes and we would have been there.	Awọn iṣẹju diẹ diẹ sii ati pe a yoo ti wa nibẹ.

I could still see his face as he looked at me.	Mo tun le ri oju rẹ bi o ti wo mi.
It should be around in the next few days.	O yẹ ki o wa ni ayika ni awọn ọjọ diẹ julọ julọ.

It has such a history that it does not keep jobs.	O ni iru itan ti ko tọju awọn iṣẹ.

You have been on this path for a long time.	O ti wa lori ọna yii fun igba pipẹ.
Who is this?	Ti tani eyi jẹ ti?
I will go over this as soon as I get home.	Emi yoo lọ lori eyi ni kete ti Mo ba de ile.
That did not happen.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ.
We know what you need to do things.	A mọ ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe awọn nkan.
Students here.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe nibi.
But no word came to him.	Ṣugbọn ko si ọrọ ti o wa si ọdọ rẹ.
He left himself.	O fi ara rẹ silẹ.
A picture, of course.	Aworan kan, dajudaju.
He asked an obvious question.	O beere ibeere ti o han gbangba.
For her, for her unborn child.	Fun u, fun ọmọ inu rẹ.
Just had an accident.	O kan ni ijamba.
We can live with it.	A le gbe pẹlu rẹ.
It is also great.	O tun wa ni nla.
Don't like this place?	Ṣe o ko fẹran ibi yii?
I want to work with you.	Mo fe lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
However, this is not the only explanation for this observation.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi kii ṣe alaye nikan fun akiyesi yii.
Her parents plan to do it this way.	Awọn obi rẹ gbero lati ṣe ni ọna yii.
You will become human again.	O yoo di eniyan lẹẹkansi.
Here are some ways in which you can do this.	Eyi nibi diẹ ninu ọna ti ku.
Because it is not so.	Nitori kii ṣe bẹ.
Is there a doctor at home?	Ṣe dokita kan wa ninu ile?
Do not come to my room.	Maṣe wa si yara mi.
Please, proceed.	Jọwọ, tẹsiwaju.
It was just one.	O je kan nikan.
The test is coming, especially.	Idanwo naa nbọ, paapaa.
They have a wood shop.	Wọn ni ile itaja igi kan.
This guy did well here.	Arakunrin yii ṣe daradara nibi.

We even cut a deal with them.	A ge adehun pẹlu wọn paapaa.
Take all the benefits.	Mu gbogbo awọn anfani.
It's my family.	Idile mi ni.
No one will write that now.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo kọ iyẹn ni bayi.

Honestly, can you hear me?	Ni otitọ, ṣe o le gbọ mi?
How many years? 	Odun melo?
It is not possible to work.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati ṣiṣẹ.
They seem the same thing, but in reality they are not.	Wọn dabi ohun kanna, ṣugbọn ni otitọ wọn kii ṣe.
I gave up the game.	Mo ti fun kuro ni ere.
You can not have.	O ko le ni.
But the first mistake is not yours.	Ṣugbọn aṣiṣe akọkọ kii ṣe tirẹ.
Let me get that for you.	Jẹ ki n gba iyẹn fun ọ.
I wish he would say something, like what he knows.	Mo fẹ pe oun yoo sọ nkankan, bii ohun ti o mọ.
They are what we will eat in their place.	Wọn jẹ ohun ti a yoo jẹ ni ipo wọn.
I’m not trying to say you can’t get out.	Emi ko gbiyanju lati sọ pe o ko le jade.
And with good reason.	Ati pẹlu idi ti o dara.
Now is good.	Bayi jẹ dara.
And at some point there will be mistakes.	Ati ni akoko kan awọn aṣiṣe yoo wa.
Did not find any.	Ko ri eyikeyi.
And not much if you can.	Ati pe kii ṣe pupọ ti o ba le.
This is very important.	Eyi ṣe pataki pupọ.
We can not do it alone.	A ko le ṣe nikan.
She turned her head to look at me.	O yi ori rẹ pada lati wo mi.
There are two functions in fact with that name.	Awọn iṣẹ meji wa ni otitọ pẹlu orukọ yẹn.
And save the date.	Ki o si fi awọn ọjọ.
But, my phone.	Ṣugbọn, foonu mi.
Your team will work best when they are even themselves.	Ẹgbẹ rẹ yoo ṣiṣẹ dara julọ nigbati wọn ba jẹ ara wọn paapaa.
She has very fine hair.	O ni irun to dara pupọ.
Why so many books about dogs?	Kini idi ti awọn iwe pupọ nipa awọn aja?
I am now.	Emi ni bayi.
It doesn't seem to be long.	O dabi pe kii yoo pẹ.
It does not help either.	Ko ṣe iranlọwọ boya.
Students are filled with questions.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ti kun nipasẹ awọn ibeere.
Find the water.	Wa omi naa.
I could not live without it.	Emi ko le gbe laisi rẹ.
I know better than to let this happen.	Mo mọ dara ju lati jẹ ki eyi ṣẹlẹ.
He made them.	O ṣe wọn.
Some good news can be obtained.	Diẹ ninu awọn iroyin ti o dara le gba.
Just let the words flow.	O kan jẹ ki awọn ọrọ san.
I know this is a big problem.	Mo mọ pe eyi jẹ wahala nla.
And our young people hear that.	Ati awọn ọdọ wa gbọ iyẹn.
You can not log out again.	O ko le jade lẹẹkansi.
He had stopped, could not go together.	O ti duro, ko le lọ papọ.
From time to time, we hear the word.	Ni akoko ati igba, a gbọ ọrọ naa.
They hate each other.	Wọn korira ara wọn.
He will be in everything.	Oun yoo wa ninu ohun gbogbo.
It gives.	O fun ni.
They jumped up and down and nothing moved.	Wọn fo si oke ati isalẹ ati pe ko si nkan ti o gbe.
Notice them all.	Ṣe akiyesi gbogbo wọn.
My body has really changed over the last year.	Ara mi ti yipada gaan ni ọdun to kọja.
It will not change.	Ko ni yi pada.
This could not be better.	Eyi ko le dara.
Some of us see the future coming to us.	Diẹ ninu wa rii ọjọ iwaju ti n bọ si wa.
I stopped.	Mo duro duro.
They showed me everything, but told me nothing.	Wọn fi ohun gbogbo han mi, ṣugbọn sọ ohunkohun fun mi.
Their home is always in trouble.	Ile won nigbagbogbo wa ni wahala.
But it may be too late.	Ṣugbọn o le pẹ ju.
So that you can be able to write these kinds of things.	Ki o le ni anfani lati kọ awọn iru nkan wọnyi.
What he told me was the truth of his story.	Ohun ti o sọ fun mi ni otitọ itan rẹ.
You have to decide what to do with this information.	O ni lati pinnu kini iwọ yoo ṣe pẹlu alaye yii.
I have never met anyone in this new group before.	Emi ko tii pade ẹnikẹni ninu ẹgbẹ tuntun yii tẹlẹ.
Not someone who doesn’t even know.	Kii ṣe ẹnikan ti ko mọ paapaa.
This will be about their story.	Eyi yoo jẹ nipa itan wọn.
It could happen again.	O le ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
Sometimes it can be difficult for yourself.	Nigba miiran o le nira fun ara rẹ.
They both know the truth.	Awọn mejeeji mọ otitọ.
Others work in.	Awọn miiran ṣiṣẹ ninu.
Let's try this together and see what happens.	Jẹ ki a gbiyanju eyi papọ ki a wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
He reached out to me.	O de ọdọ mi.
He could not make his decision.	Ko le ṣe ipinnu rẹ.
I believe in the power of words.	Mo gbagbọ ninu agbara awọn ọrọ.
I believe education is learning.	Mo gbagbọ pe ẹkọ jẹ ẹkọ.
Maybe your first drive is full.	Boya awakọ akọkọ rẹ ti kun.
I will do it for my son.	Emi yoo ṣe fun ọmọ mi.
A job you were happy with.	A ise ti o wà dun pẹlu.
What you expect is.	Ohun ti o reti ni.
Write again, well.	Kọ lẹẹkansi, daradara.
Some do not.	Diẹ ninu awọn ko.
And, even, grow up for me.	Ati pe, paapaa, dagba nitori mi.
This is now.	Eleyi jẹ bayi.
Whether that or that just doesn’t matter.	Boya iyẹn tabi o kan ko ṣe akiyesi.
I drive to the store and get some water.	Mo wakọ si ile itaja ati gba omi.
You can see for yourself.	O le wo ara rẹ.
You have more to say.	O ni diẹ lati sọ.
First, with a button.	Ni akọkọ, pẹlu bọtini kan.
Just buy.	O kan ra.
Do what they say.	Ṣe ohun ti wọn sọ.
I want to see the world.	Mo fe ri aye.
I will say it again.	Emi yoo tun sọ.
It was his idea to come here.	O jẹ imọran rẹ lati wa si ibi.
He picked up his bag and went to work.	O gba iwe apo rẹ o si lọ si ibi iṣẹ.
If you are.	Ti o ba wa.
He had no idea the two even talked at all.	O ko ni imọran awọn mejeeji paapaa sọrọ rara.
I explain my wishes.	Mo ṣe alaye awọn ifẹ mi.
He’s just doing his job.	O kan n ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
We are starting small.	A n bẹrẹ kekere.
And with reports of other proposals.	Ati pẹlu iroyin ti awọn imọran miiran.
You have come to better yourself.	O ti wa lati dara ara rẹ.
But, that is the key.	Ṣugbọn, iyẹn ni bọtini.
In fact, at the very least.	Ni otitọ, o kere pupọ paapaa.
We take care of ourselves.	A tọju ti ara wa.
Was one of my absolute favorite football players.	Je ọkan ninu mi idi ayanfẹ bọọlu awọn ẹrọ orin.
No one seems to care about that.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o dabi ẹni pe o ni aniyan nipa iyẹn.
It cannot happen.	Ko le ṣẹlẹ.
Something weird about what he was doing.	Nkankan wa ti iyalẹnu nipa ohun ti o n ṣe.
Life is hard.	Igbesi aye jẹ lile.
There is nothing they can do.	Ko si ohun ti wọn le ṣe.
Maybe those three things are the whole point.	Boya awọn nkan mẹta naa jẹ gbogbo aaye naa.
However, the system seems to work well.	Sibẹsibẹ, eto naa dabi pe o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
I do not live.	Emi ko gbe.
We are running fast.	A n sare ti akoko.
If it breaks through the inner force, life begins.	Ti o ba fọ nipasẹ agbara inu, igbesi aye bẹrẹ.
It is good to open a program.	O dara lati ṣii eto kan.
It is a way of making the world look and feel beautiful.	O ni ọna kan ti ṣiṣe awọn aye wo ki o si lero lẹwa.
Everyone wants to drink it.	Gbogbo eniyan fe rẹ mu.
The meeting slept with his words ringing in their ears.	Ipade naa sun pẹlu awọn ọrọ rẹ ti n dun ni eti wọn.
We make sure you know what to expect.	A rii daju pe o mọ ohun ti o yẹ ki o reti.
It seemed good.	O dabi enipe o dara.
The service is good now.	Iṣẹ naa dara ni bayi.
And it's worth it.	Ati pe o tọ.
All that can be is you.	Gbogbo ohun ti o le jẹ ni iwọ.
When that happens, you may need to move on.	Nigbati iyẹn ba ṣẹlẹ, o le nilo lati tẹsiwaju.
Lots and lots of love.	Pupọ ati ọpọlọpọ ifẹ.
There are many things we do not talk about.	Awọn nkan pupọ lo wa ti a ko sọrọ nipa.
We'll have to talk sometimes.	A yoo ni lati sọrọ nigba miiran.
As they would just get out of the company that day.	Bi wọn yoo kan jade kuro ni ile-iṣẹ ni ọjọ yẹn.
The man said he was not happy.	Ọkunrin naa sọ pe inu oun ko dun.
If you get used to it.	Ti o ba gba a lo.
He pulled himself back and continued.	O mu ara rẹ sẹhin o si tẹsiwaju.
Her body was not well, but she continued to work.	Ara rẹ ko dara, ṣugbọn o tẹsiwaju lati ṣiṣẹ.
He did not take sides.	Ko gba ẹgbẹ.
These are.	Awọn wọnyi ni.
Who knows, maybe they will.	Tani o mọ, boya wọn yoo.
You do not accept that you have made a mistake.	O ko gba pe o ti ṣe aṣiṣe.
Even not last year.	Paapaa kii ṣe ọdun to kọja.
There was little need.	Nibẹ wà kekere nilo.
Nothing will stop him now.	Ko si ohun ti yoo da a duro bayi.
Everyone can use that.	Gbogbo eniyan le lo iyẹn.
Not sure about that.	Ko daju nipa iyẹn.
Maybe they hold hands.	Boya wọn di ọwọ mu.
Not used.	Ko lo.
You can make things happen more or less frequently.	O le jẹ ki awọn nkan ṣẹlẹ diẹ sii tabi kere si nigbagbogbo.
And it remains now for hours.	Ati ki o si maa wa bayi fun wakati.
I talked to him a lot.	Mo ba a sọrọ pupọ.
More like a friend than a girl.	Diẹ bi ọrẹ ju ọmọbirin lọ.
Find slaves.	Wa bayi.
I believe this is a new issue.	Mo gbagbọ pe eyi jẹ ọrọ tuntun.
Take the baby's clothes off.	Ya aṣọ ọmọ naa kuro.
This eliminates all errors.	Eyi n jade gbogbo aṣiṣe.
I want that now.	Mo fẹ iyẹn ni bayi.
asked the boy.	beere lọwọ ọmọkunrin naa.
It will be easier if you just change your name.	Yoo rọrun ti o ba kan yi orukọ rẹ pada.
He talked for hours with a childhood friend.	O sọrọ fun awọn wakati pẹlu ọrẹ ọmọde kan.
Which he did.	Eyi ti o ṣe.
I do not intend to hurt anyone.	Emi ko pinnu lati ṣe ipalara ẹnikẹni.
And just get out of there.	Ati pe o kan lọ kuro nibẹ.
Such a way.	Iru ọna.
You should leave me.	O yẹ ki o fi mi silẹ.
I just want to be close again.	Mo kan fẹ ki a wa nitosi lẹẹkansi.
However, he promised to return.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ṣe ileri lati pada.
He has given us this.	O ti fun wa ni eyi.
Will work here.	Yoo ṣiṣẹ lọwọ nibi.
Don't ask me how.	Maṣe beere lọwọ mi bawo.
And it might be better.	Ati pe o le dara julọ.
I will tell you something.	Emi yoo so nkankan fun o.
The city streets are full of life.	Awọn opopona ilu naa ti kun fun igbesi aye.
You do not want the best of what you see.	Iwọ ko fẹ ohun ti o dara julọ ti ohun ti o rii.
I think we have to take them seriously now.	Mo ro pe a ni lati mu wọn ni pataki ni bayi.
Understanding what it takes, however, can take weeks.	Loye ohun ti o mu, sibẹsibẹ, le gba awọn ọsẹ.
They are everyone's opinion.	Wọn jẹ ero ti gbogbo eniyan.
I know life in this area.	Mo mọ igbesi aye ni agbegbe yii.
You think you love them.	O ro pe o nifẹ wọn.
He always works at home.	Nigbagbogbo o ṣiṣẹ ni ile.
Is taken into account.	Ti wa ni ya sinu iroyin.
It gives away.	O n fun ni kuro.
I will open it for you.	Emi yoo ṣii fun ọ.
If you write something good it will sell itself.	Ti o ba kọ nkan ti o dara yoo ta funrararẹ.
It doesn't take more than a minute.	Ko gba to ju iṣẹju kan lọ.
I do not expect anything less.	Emi ko nireti ohunkohun kere.
That was for men.	Ti o wà fun awọn ọkunrin.
The reasons were similar.	Awọn idi wà iru.
I am very good.	Mo dara pupọ.
They will not learn.	Wọn kii yoo kọ ẹkọ.
To the office.	Si ọfiisi.
I can not look up.	Nko le wo soke.
Sorry to hear about your mother.	Ma binu lati gbọ nipa iya rẹ.
Children wear school uniforms.	Awọn ọmọde wọ aṣọ ile-iwe.
You can try that.	O le gbiyanju iyẹn.
In other words, we have no idea.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, a ko ni imọran nkan.
Same thing again.	Ohun kanna lẹẹkansi.
I love the months spent there.	Mo nifẹ awọn oṣu ti a lo nibẹ.
I think you get the point.	Mo ro pe o gba aaye naa.
You do it now.	O ṣe ni bayi.
Sometimes they are not.	Nigba miiran wọn kii ṣe.
I’m sure you can figure them out.	Mo ni idaniloju pe o le ro wọn jade.
Some will not appear.	Awọn kan kii yoo han.
Drive me home.	Wakọ mi ile.
You can remember what happened last night.	O le ranti ohun ti o ti kọja ni alẹ.
That is what they thought.	Ohun ti won ro niyen.
Think you might be interested in this.	Ro pe o le nifẹ ninu eyi.
You can not go out.	O ko le jade.
I'm sure they will eat some of that.	Mo ni idaniloju pe wọn yoo jẹ diẹ ninu iyẹn.
I will not use anything else.	Emi kii yoo lo ohunkohun miiran.
This is our city.	Eyi ni ilu wa.
For him, and for me.	Fun oun, ati fun mi.
But every book needs at least some sort of conclusion or something.	Ṣugbọn gbogbo iwe nilo o kere diẹ ninu iru ipari tabi nkankan.
Here try the following.	Nibi gbiyanju awọn wọnyi.
Only your eyes live.	Oju re nikan lo gbe.
I can't get enough.	Nko le gba to.
And that was probably nothing.	Ati awọn ti o wà jasi ohunkohun.
We will continue our studies.	A yoo tẹsiwaju awọn ẹkọ wa.
This area is a great place for food.	Agbegbe yii jẹ aaye nla fun ounjẹ.
Or obviously they do.	Tabi o han pe wọn ṣe.
Himself, he said.	Ara rẹ, o sọ.
What is your biggest mistake in life?	Kini aṣiṣe nla rẹ ni igbesi aye?
He will be amazing at that job.	Oun yoo jẹ iyanu ni iṣẹ yẹn.
You can read more about the day here.	O le ka diẹ sii nipa ọjọ naa nibi.
I returned to his office.	Mo pada si ọfiisi rẹ.
The brother is living his best life.	Arakunrin naa n gbe igbesi aye rẹ ti o dara julọ.
This meeting is not our first with this person.	Ipade yii kii ṣe akọkọ wa pẹlu eniyan yii.
See us now.	Wo wa bayi.
He turned off the lights again.	O si pa awọn ina lẹẹkansi.
You want to hurry in the summer.	O fẹ lati yara ni akoko ooru.
You need to use a function for that type of application.	O nilo lati lo iṣẹ kan fun iru ohun elo naa.
It's not easy at all.	Ko rọrun rara rara.
They will come back.	Wọn yoo pada wa.
Do not tell that to anyone.	Maṣe sọ iyẹn fun ẹnikẹni.
They are just there, and they are what they are.	Wọn wa nibẹ nikan, ati pe wọn jẹ ohun ti wọn jẹ.
We just are in it.	A kan wa ninu rẹ.
She will refuse to marry you.	O yoo kọ lati fẹ ọ.
It was like a game.	O dabi ere kan.
This has been very well done.	Eleyi a ti gan daradara ṣe.
We did not see anything.	A ko wo ohunkohun rara.
He is on another planet.	O wa lori aye miiran.
This is the first situation.	Eyi ni ipo akọkọ.
Not sure what the problem is.	Ko daju kini iṣoro naa.
You can still get your own boat.	O le gba ọkọ oju omi tirẹ sibẹsibẹ.
I have to call you.	Mo ni lati pe e ki n pe e.
Pretty much forgotten.	Lẹwa Elo gbagbe.
I have no power over myself.	Emi ko ni agbara lori ara mi.
The journey takes about two hours.	Irin-ajo naa gba to bii wakati meji.
And he was young.	Ati pe o jẹ ọdọ.
Now, that sounds good because it tells you we are back again.	Bayi, iyẹn dun nitori o sọ fun ọ pe a tun wa lẹhin lẹẹkansi.
However, that is not the best idea at all.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn kii ṣe imọran ti o dara julọ rara.
You need to make up your mind to find yourself.	O nilo lati ṣe awọn ero lati rii ararẹ ni otitọ.
I finished.	Mo ti pari.
It is a place we love.	O jẹ aaye ti a nifẹ.
Allow him to clean his room.	Gba u lati nu yara rẹ.
He had many friends in his time.	O ti ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ ni akoko rẹ.
I look at them, trying to read their faces.	Mo wo wọn, n gbiyanju lati ka oju wọn.
At the very least.	O kere pupọ.
When you read, read.	Nigbati o ba ka, ka.
I would have liked to have had more time.	Emi yoo ti fẹ lati ni akoko diẹ sii.
On the other hand it can be interesting.	Lori awọn miiran ọwọ o le jẹ awon.
I like both things, especially.	Mo fẹran awọn nkan mejeeji, paapaa.
One is physical.	Ọkan jẹ ti ara.
So he got up with me.	Nitorina o dide pẹlu mi.
Or, more importantly, kill.	Tabi, ni pataki, pa.
You will love it when you use it.	Iwọ yoo nifẹ nigbati o ba lo.
About your pictures.	Nipa awọn aworan rẹ.
We have left everything.	A ti fi ohun gbogbo silẹ.
It breaks a little.	O fọ diẹ.
If they can find.	Ti won ba le ri.
No time to talk names.	Ko akoko lati sọrọ awọn orukọ.
Good believe.	Dara gbagbọ.
It always seems to last for hours.	O nigbagbogbo dabi lati ṣiṣe fun wakati.
I do not even know how that is possible.	Emi ko paapaa mọ bi iyẹn ṣe ṣee ṣe.
Her students are almost certain.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe rẹ ti fẹrẹ diẹ.
You don’t even know.	O ko paapaa mọ.
You have no idea.	O ko ni ero.
It is easy to see why.	O rọrun lati rii idi.
Now your child does the same way, twice.	Bayi ọmọ rẹ ṣe ni ọna kanna, igba meji.
This man does not hate her.	Ọkunrin yii ko korira rẹ.
And that’s always hard to hear.	Ati pe iyẹn nigbagbogbo nira lati gbọ.
It has come to an end.	O ti de ipinnu.
We are thinking of opening a store one day.	A n ronu lati ṣii ile itaja kan ni ọjọ kan.
But this is a mistake.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.

Both sides make their own in the end.	Awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji ṣe ara wọn ni ipari.
You can really raise your hand.	O le gbe ọwọ rẹ gaan.
Life is no better.	Igbesi aye ko dara ju eyi lọ.
Things are working well.	Awọn nkan n ṣiṣẹ daradara.
Teams don’t always think about these things.	Awọn ẹgbẹ nigbagbogbo ko ronu nipa nkan wọnyi.
No phones here.	Ko si awọn foonu nibi.
And it was a mistake.	Ati pe o jẹ aṣiṣe.
On top.	Lori oke.
She tried to eat, but could not force herself.	O gbiyanju lati jẹun, ṣugbọn ko le fi agbara mu ara rẹ.
You need to know that.	O nilo rẹ lati mọ pe.
It’s that easy.	O rọrun ni ọna yẹn.
She looks like a child.	O dabi ọmọ.
I knew too little.	Mo ti mọ ju kekere.
Opopona at this time.	Opopona ni wakati yii.
You have the key.	O ni bọtini.
Please read this book.	Jọwọ ka iwe yii.
I should work on that really.	Mo yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ lori iyẹn gaan.
If families have stayed together.	Ti awọn idile ba ti duro papọ.
We wait for work.	A duro fun iṣẹ.
Or maybe not.	Tabi boya kii ṣe.
Essentially, people are physical things.	Ni pataki, eniyan jẹ awọn nkan ti ara.
The company does not give a.	Ile-iṣẹ naa ko fun ni kan.
One very hot.	Kan gbona gan daradara.
It's been long enough.	O ti pẹ to.
And we have to let it all go now.	Ati pe a ni lati jẹ ki gbogbo nkan naa lọ ni bayi.
He knew they were in it for the money.	O mọ pe wọn wa ninu rẹ fun owo naa.
I need what they can give me.	Mo nilo ohun ti wọn le fun mi.
At one point.	Ni aaye kan.
I thought it was something that worked.	Mo ro o nkankan ti o ṣiṣẹ.
It will be sent to you there.	Yoo ranṣẹ si ọ nibẹ.
He wanted me to kill my job.	O fe mi lati pa ise mi.
That’s me we have.	Iyẹn jẹ mi ti a ni.
It looks like one has arrived.	O wo bi ọkan ti de.
It is all here in this letter.	Gbogbo rẹ wa nibi ninu lẹta yii.
I know you, but don't go too far.	Mo mọ rẹ, ṣugbọn maṣe wọ ilu pupọ mọ.
First, it’s all there.	Ni akọkọ, o jẹ gbogbo rẹ.
Others are similar.	Awọn miiran jẹ iru.
He did it in two minutes.	O si ṣe ni iṣẹju meji.
These will tell a story, it is convincing.	Awọn wọnyi yoo sọ itan kan, o ni idaniloju.
It shook my head.	O mi ori.
But things did not go as planned.	Ṣugbọn awọn nkan ko lọ bi a ti pinnu.
There are still many questions.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere ṣi wa.
He is not worried.	Oun ko ni aniyan.
Here are some of them.	Nibi ni diẹ ninu wọn.
It was there for days.	O wa nibẹ fun awọn ọjọ.
Here you have everything you need.	Nibi o ni ohun gbogbo ti o nilo.
Of course that's right.	Dajudaju iyẹn tọ.
I know who.	Mo mọ tani.
I will read the thing again.	Emi yoo ka nkan naa lẹẹkansi.
But keep in touch.	Ṣugbọn tọju kan si.
Music can do that.	Orin le ṣe bẹ.
He does not believe.	Ko gbagbọ.
Everyone who has anyone is there.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o ni ẹnikẹni wa nibẹ.
And for the music itself.	Ati fun orin funrararẹ.
For sure your face.	Fun daju oju rẹ.
And this is why.	Ati idi eyi.
There is nothing wrong with the donation made.	Ko si aṣiṣe ninu ẹbun ti a ṣe.
You should stop now.	O yẹ ki o duro ni bayi.
I am doing a lot.	Mo n ṣe pupọ julọ.
Months before time.	Awọn oṣu ṣaaju akoko.
Good teachers change the lives of children.	Awọn olukọ ti o dara yi igbesi aye awọn ọmọde pada.
Work continues in this area.	Iṣẹ tẹsiwaju ni agbegbe yii.
You can’t go wrong.	O ko le ṣe aṣiṣe diẹ sii.
There are two reasons why this should be the case.	Awọn idi meji ni eyi yẹ ki o jẹ bẹ.
But there is good reason for that.	Ṣugbọn idi ti o dara wa fun iyẹn.
We have enough money to start the project.	A ni owo ti o to lati bẹrẹ iṣẹ naa.
You never know what to do with it all.	O ko mọ kini lati ṣe pẹlu gbogbo rẹ.
I can't find anything like this.	Nko le ri bi eleyi.
The sister was full of them all.	Arabinrin naa kun fun gbogbo wọn.
I went to your house.	Mo lọ si ile rẹ.
I know you don’t.	Mo mọ pe o ko.
No one knows the state of their lives.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ ipo ti aye wọn.
Does anyone know anything?	Ṣe ẹnikẹni mọ nkankan?
He is not very good.	Oun ko dara pupọ.
By night you have loved me, but by night you have left me.	Lati alẹ ni iwọ ti fẹ mi, ṣugbọn lati alẹ ni iwọ ti fi mi silẹ.
If they need more wood, just call me.	Ti wọn ba nilo igi diẹ, kan pe mi.
We will have to stand them out.	A yoo ni lati duro wọn jade.
You have done this.	O ti ṣe eyi.
Winter came to me.	Igba otutu gun de ọdọ mi.
But soon, it will stop.	Ṣugbọn laipẹ, yoo da.
It is nearby.	O wa nitosi.
Take him and see if he has any money.	Mu u ki o rii boya o ni owo eyikeyi.
Sorry for the.	Ma binu fun awọn.
He did nothing wrong to me as a person.	Ko ṣe ohunkohun buburu si mi bi awọn eniyan kan.
I asked for water, and I closed my eyes.	Mo beere fun omi, mo si pa oju mi ​​mọ.
He has left the company.	O ti jẹ ki ile-iṣẹ naa silẹ.
You can cook over a fire.	O le ṣe ounjẹ lori ina.
She said her teacher would take care of her.	O sọ pe olukọ rẹ yoo tọju rẹ.
But no one did that.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe bẹ.
I think it would have worked.	Mo ro pe yoo ti ṣiṣẹ.
But that is important.	Sugbon ti o ba wa pataki.
They have a house.	Won ni ile.
He could not cross it.	Ko le kọja rẹ.
That would be nice.	Iyẹn yoo dara.
But it was his first with his new team.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ akọkọ rẹ pẹlu ẹgbẹ tuntun rẹ.
No one lives there anymore.	Ko si ẹniti o gbe nibẹ mọ.
There are facts of the matter.	Awọn otitọ ti ọrọ naa wa.
He dropped his gift in my lap, and hurried away.	O da ẹbun rẹ silẹ ni itan mi, o si yara lọ.
This, as we know, did not happen.	Eyi, bi a ti mọ, ko ṣẹlẹ.
It has a lot to say.	O ni pupọ lati sọ.
So, he asked me.	Nitorina, o beere lọwọ mi.
I think about the future.	Mo ro nipa ojo iwaju.
I can't put them in place.	Emi ko le fi wọn si aaye.
Please tell me what happened.	Jọwọ sọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ fun mi.
No one tried to stop me.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o gbiyanju lati da mi duro.
Bring them to life.	Mu wọn wa si aye.
The world is not like me.	Aye ko ni iru mi ninu.
So this is how it is given.	Nitorina bayi ni a fi fun u.
They are some great shoes to fill.	Wọn jẹ diẹ ninu awọn bata nla lati kun.
The car is outside.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wa ni ita.
It should go down to zero.	O yẹ ki o lọ silẹ si odo.
Who owns this house?	Tani o ni ile yi?
We're giving them some back.	A n fun wọn ni diẹ ninu rẹ pada.
He died in a plane crash.	O ku ninu ijamba ọkọ ofurufu kan.
We are better than this.	A dara ju eyi lọ.
Cut the paper at that edge.	Ge iwe naa ni eti yẹn.
I'll give you a night's rest.	Emi yoo fun ọ ni isinmi alẹ.
That would be a really good story.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ itan ti o dara gaan.
We left a lot of great games.	A fi ọpọlọpọ awọn ere nla silẹ.
But what bothers me is that another word.	Sugbon ohun ti o kan mi ni wipe miiran ọrọ.
I noticed for the first time that he carried a small box.	Mo ṣe akiyesi fun igba akọkọ pe o gbe apoti kekere kan.
Such a place.	Iru ibi ni.
Students say this.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe sọ eyi.
You can accident.	O le ijamba.
That is how we know what should happen.	Ti o jẹ bi a ti mọ ohun ti o yẹ lati ṣẹlẹ.
He didn’t think anything else for years.	Ko ro ohunkohun miiran fun ọdun.
This is to test.	Eyi wa lati ṣe idanwo.
I will stay with you.	Emi yoo duro pẹlu rẹ.
That was the agreement.	Ti o wà ni adehun.
The first thing will be to find some warm water.	Ohun akọkọ yoo jẹ lati wa diẹ ninu omi gbona.
So much to lose.	Ki Elo lati padanu.
That’s not all.	Iyẹn kii ṣe gbogbo rẹ.
It's easy to put together.	O rọrun lati fi papọ.
Maybe you can't reach this.	Boya o ko le de ọdọ eyi.
This time, it gives you something new when you do that.	Ni akoko yii, o fun ọ ni nkan tuntun nigbati o ba ṣe iyẹn.
I still love it.	Mo tun nifẹ rẹ.
You have to talk to my parents.	O ni lati ba awọn obi mi sọrọ.
The problem is not what they say but what they do not say.	Iṣoro naa kii ṣe ohun ti wọn sọ ṣugbọn ohun ti wọn ko sọ.
To do so, you need to know who you are.	Lati ṣe bẹ, o ni lati mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
No, we say.	Rara, a sọ.
You can insert it back, after.	O le fi sii pada, lẹhin.
Two girls have nothing of their mother-in-law about them.	Awọn ọmọbirin meji ti ko ni nkan ti ọkọ iya wọn nipa wọn.
They have not started work yet.	Wọn ko tii bẹrẹ iṣẹ sibẹsibẹ.
It has been under him.	O ti wa labẹ rẹ.
I do tests.	Mo ṣe awọn idanwo.
He never returned to school.	Ko pada si ile-iwe rara.
Maybe he was dead for an hour.	Boya o ti ku fun wakati kan.
Add dates and go again.	Fi awọn ọjọ kun ati ki o lọ lẹẹkansi.
And boy, do they forever.	Ati ọmọkunrin, ṣe wọn lailai.
You just want to touch it.	O kan fẹ lati fi ọwọ kan.
That is forever determined.	Iyẹn ti pinnu lailai.
We all fell asleep minutes after climbing into bed.	Gbogbo wa sun oorun ni iṣẹju lẹhin ti o gun ori ibusun.
He looked into the fire.	O wo inu ina.
It's over.	O kọja lọ.
I am here because of you.	Mo wa nibi nitori rẹ.
No news on his father yet.	Ko si iroyin lori baba rẹ sibẹsibẹ.
By your own kind.	Nipa iru ara rẹ.
He did not.	Ko ṣe bẹ.
How did the accident happen?	Bawo ni ijamba naa ṣe ṣẹlẹ?
Everyone is invited.	Gbogbo eniyan ni a pe.
The two men looked at each other.	Awọn ọkunrin meji naa wo ara wọn.
I want to leave.	Mo fẹ lati lọ kuro nibẹ.
To the big house.	Si ile nla.
The hair on her face is very nice.	Irun ti o wa ni oju rẹ dara pupọ.
There are also three other large restaurants nearby.	Awọn ile ounjẹ nla mẹta miiran tun wa nitosi.
But it has been more than three years.	Ṣugbọn o ti pẹ ju ọdun mẹta lọ.
That may not help.	Iyẹn ko le ṣe iranlọwọ.
He woke up late and missed breakfast.	O ji ni pẹ ati pe o padanu ounjẹ owurọ.
Maybe all of them.	Boya gbogbo wọn.
He swam across the river.	O we kọja odo.
It has not been hit.	Ko ti lu ina.
Can't read your watch.	Ko le ka aago rẹ.
I have something to say.	Mo ni nkankan lati sọ.
Eye on it.	Oju lori rẹ.
The woman dropped her lock.	Obinrin naa fi tii rẹ silẹ.
Or something in them.	Tabi nkankan wa ninu wọn.
You need a new box.	O nilo apoti tuntun kan.
Say the name.	Sọ orukọ naa.
I have to talk to him.	Mo ni lati ba a sọrọ.
More great for a girl.	Diẹ nla fun ọmọbirin kan.
That’s why you play games.	Ti o ni idi ti o mu awọn ere.
Not the purpose of this book.	Kii ṣe idi ti iwe yii.
Find a new way.	Wa ọna tuntun.
And, as they say, that's it.	Ati pe, bi wọn ṣe sọ, iyẹn ni.
The eye is the face of the eye only.	Oju jẹ oju ti oju nikan.
Ask them to consider your thoughts.	Beere wọn lati ro ero rẹ.
Wait for that!	Duro pe!
Water passed through the tree.	Omi kọja nipasẹ igi naa.
I'll take it with me.	Emi yoo mu u pẹlu mi.
You are looking for yourself.	O n wa ara rẹ.
Maybe you bought a lot.	Boya o ra pupọ.
They don’t see how bad that is, at first.	Wọn ko rii bi iyẹn ṣe jẹ ohun buburu, ni akọkọ.
I hadn’t been there two weeks when it happened.	Emi ko ti wa nibẹ ọsẹ meji nigbati o ṣẹlẹ.
You don't want me there.	O ko fẹ mi nibẹ.
You can talk to simple people.	O le sọrọ si awọn eniyan rọrun.
I do not want to be friends with you!	Emi ko fẹ lati jẹ ọrẹ pẹlu rẹ!
I do not know why or how.	Emi ko mọ idi tabi bi.
Wondering, isn't it?	Iyalẹnu, ṣe kii ṣe bẹ?
We’ve talked about it.	A ti sọrọ nipa rẹ.
You look down, at the point where your feet should be.	O wo isalẹ, ni aaye ti ẹsẹ rẹ yẹ ki o wa.
You are human.	Eniyan ni o.
There must be something you can do to help him.	Ohun kan gbọdọ wa ti o le ṣe lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
She is very angry about it.	O binu pupọ nipa rẹ.
I am very happy.	Inu mi dun pupo.
He looked at my face.	O wo oju mi.
He thought no one knew.	O ro pe ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ.
That is not an easy thing to do.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti o rọrun lati ṣe.
However, he has done more.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ti ṣe diẹ sii.
Again the reason this is happening is due to two things.	Lẹẹkansi idi ti eyi n ṣẹlẹ jẹ nitori ohun meji.
And you know, we can’t do much in this.	Ati pe o mọ, a ko le ṣe pupọ ninu eyi.
Time takes its toll on everyone.	Akoko gba owo rẹ lori gbogbo eniyan.
For a week.	Fun ọsẹ kan.
You must accept life as it comes.	O gbọdọ gba aye bi o ti de.
I decided to make one.	Mo pinnu lati ṣe ọkan.
However he was the one who did about that.	Sibẹsibẹ o jẹ ẹniti o ṣe nipa iyẹn.
He rose.	O dide.
With that love embark on a journey.	Pẹlu ifẹ yẹn bẹrẹ irin-ajo kan.
However, none of these points are correct.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko si ọkan ninu awọn aaye wọnyi ti o tọ.
I don’t want to think about anything.	Emi ko fẹ lati ronu nipa ohunkohun.
Others said they were at lunch.	Awọn miiran sọ pe wọn wa ni ounjẹ ọsan.
They will.	Wọn yoo ṣe.
I don’t know if we ever were able to.	Emi ko mọ pe a lailai ni anfani lati.
As it never really happened.	Bi o ti ko gan ṣẹlẹ.
She loves it for that.	O nifẹ rẹ fun iyẹn.
Also feeling good.	Tun rilara ti o dara.
It's better not to want to be together all the time.	O dara lati ko fẹ lati wa papọ nigbagbogbo.
People love it.	Awọn eniyan fẹran rẹ.
Details are given in the text.	Awọn alaye ti wa ni fun ni awọn ọrọ.
Not for yourself.	Ko fun ara rẹ.
I wonder how it would feel if you knew my plan.	Mo ṣe iyalẹnu bawo ni yoo ṣe rilara ti o ba mọ eto mi.
Say no.	Sọ pe ko ṣe.
Or at least give it a try.	Tabi ni tabi o kere fun o kan gbiyanju.
I will be here to meet you.	Emi yoo wa nibi lati pade rẹ.
Some high.	Diẹ ninu awọn ga.
Come back.	Pada wa.
When it comes down to it, it’s amazing.	Nigbati o ba wa ni isalẹ, o jẹ iyanu.
Some work that is.	Diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ ti o jẹ.
People from all walks of life.	Eniyan lati gbogbo rin ti aye.
Do not take good care of them.	Maṣe tọju wọn daradara.
But that is not the case.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe.
They wisely took their reward for him.	Wọn fi ọgbọn gba ere wọn fun u.
It is hard to decide what to work on !.	O jẹ gidigidi lati pinnu kini lati ṣiṣẹ lori !.
It was the right thing to do.	O jẹ ohun ti o tọ lati ṣe.
One of the boys was arrested.	Ọkan ninu awọn ọmọkunrin ti a mu.
For many reasons.	Fun ọpọlọpọ awọn idi.
The picture is yours.	Aworan naa jẹ tirẹ.
Well honestly it doesn’t matter to me.	Daradara ni otitọ ko ṣe pataki si mi.
No need to be there.	Ko nilo lati wa nibẹ.
I want to see you.	Mo fe ri e.
You may have died on it.	O le ti ku lori rẹ.
Just a minute here and there.	O kan iṣẹju kan nibi ati nibẹ.
Open the doors.	Ṣii awọn ilẹkun.
What we have to do is start all over again.	Ohun ti a gbọdọ ṣe ni lati bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
So, think this.	Nitorina, ro pe eyi.
You do not know what you want to say.	O ko mọ ohun ti o fẹ lati sọ.
He sat at the front of the table.	O joko ni iwaju tabili.
I have been doing this for many years.	Mo ti n ṣe bẹ fun ọdun pupọ.
Students have seen them on their way to school.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ti rii wọn ni ọna wọn si ile-iwe.
And that really means something.	Ati pe iyẹn tumọ si nkankan gaan.
We will work out.	A yoo ṣiṣẹ jade.
Life is a gift.	Igbesi aye jẹ ẹbun.
He is not like a child who tries to kill his mother.	Ko dabi ọmọ to gbiyanju lati pa iya rẹ.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	O ṣee ṣe pe o ti yipada lori rẹ.
I don’t always get this way around men.	Emi ko nigbagbogbo gba ọna yi ni ayika awọn ọkunrin.
I will write to you soon.	Emi yoo kọ si ọ laipẹ.
Are the people around us very friendly?	Ṣe awọn eniyan ti o wa ni ayika wa ni ọrẹ pupọ bi?
This article may include a travel guide.	Ọrọ yii le ni imọran irin-ajo kan ninu.
You will not tell me what to do.	Iwọ kii yoo sọ fun mi kini lati ṣe.
They have to pick up the wedding day.	Wọn ti ni lati gbe soke ọjọ igbeyawo.
The test was repeated twice.	Idanwo naa tun ṣe ni igba meji.

Good for the baby.	O dara fun ọmọ naa.
It is in all their hands.	O wa ni gbogbo ọwọ wọn.
This should not have caused problems.	Eyi ko yẹ ki o ti fa awọn iṣoro.
I hate to miss it, especially.	Mo korira lati padanu rẹ, paapaa.
And that’s when it changed.	Ati pe iyẹn ni igba ti o yipada.
Of course not feeling well today.	Dajudaju ko rilara daradara loni.
I know everything about women.	Mo mọ ohun gbogbo nipa ti obinrin.
His wife will not change.	Iyawo re ko ni yipada.
I want to go.	Mo fe lo.
Both agree on the idea.	Awọn mejeeji gba lori ero naa.
And many other ways.	Ati ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna miiran.
Wrong, but it is true.	Ko tọ, ṣugbọn o jẹ otitọ.

He likes that with everyone.	O fẹran iyẹn pẹlu gbogbo eniyan.
They will take the place of the application.	Wọn yoo gba ibi ti ohun elo naa wa.
The law works.	Ofin naa n ṣiṣẹ.
But it made me really laugh.	Ṣugbọn o mu mi rẹrin gaan.
However, not all of these sites are nearby.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe gbogbo awọn aaye wọnyi wa nitosi.
However it is not used.	Sibẹsibẹ o ko lo.
One house in the picture belongs to the fire station.	Ile kan ti o wa ninu aworan jẹ ti ibudo ina.
It seemed good enough.	O dabi enipe o dara to.
I tried but it seems to be.	Mo ti gbiyanju ṣugbọn o dabi pe o wa.
There should be rules.	Awọn ofin yẹ ki o wa.
A few ways to get to this place.	Awọn ọna diẹ lọ si ibi yii.
That kind of understanding.	Iyẹn jẹ iru oye.
He would not like it, he said.	Oun kii yoo fẹran rẹ, o sọ.
But this is what my situation has led me to.	Ṣugbọn eyi ni ipo mi ti mu mi lọ si.
What you don’t have is a personal life.	Ohun ti o ko ni ni igbesi aye ara ẹni.
You have to be able to do these things.	O ni lati ni anfani lati ṣe awọn nkan wọnyi.
I don’t think there is space there.	Emi ko ro pe ko si aaye nibẹ.
I can do this.	Mo le ṣe eyi.
Simple but tasty food.	Ounjẹ ti o rọrun ṣugbọn ti o dun.
His eyes were on both sides.	Oju rẹ wa ni ẹgbẹ mejeeji.
I go in and out.	Mo jade ati jade.
This is you and convincing.	Eyi jẹ ọ ati idaniloju.
Fear not, there are some things you can do too.	Maṣe bẹru, awọn ohun kan wa ti o le ṣe paapaa.
It’s a simple idea that changes city life.	O jẹ ero ti o rọrun ti o yi igbesi aye ilu pada.
It is not an easy task.	Kii ṣe nkan ti o rọrun.
I saw many wonderful things in life through this work.	Mo ri ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun iyanu ni igbesi aye nipasẹ iṣẹ yii.

It is very important.	O jẹ pataki pataki.
We tested the power industry performance.	A ṣe idanwo iṣẹ ile-iṣẹ agbara.
And he loved me.	O si feran mi.

Things start to look up.	Awọn nkan bẹrẹ lati wo soke.
She was my son from my first marriage.	O jẹ ọmọ mi lati igbeyawo akọkọ mi.
His words speak only the truth.	Ọrọ rẹ sọ otitọ nikan.
The boy drank a glass of water.	Ọmọkunrin naa mu omi ọsan kan.
My father had a lot of money.	Baba mi ni owo pupọ.
It just changed me.	O kan yi mi pada.
But, that is what is happening.	Ṣugbọn, iyẹn ni ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
She is very passionate about what she wears.	O jẹ ayanfẹ pupọ nipa ohun ti o wọ.
Just do it with me.	O kan ṣe pẹlu mi.
It has nothing to do with that, it has nothing to do with that.	O ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu iyẹn, ko si nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu iyẹn.
I just can't stop with this book.	Mo kan ko le da pẹlu iwe yi.

Show me where you are.	Fi ibi ti o wa han mi.
The documents say the three men were killed.	Awọn iwe naa sọ pe wọn ti pa awọn ọkunrin mẹta naa.

Maybe you will be happy.	Boya inu rẹ yoo dun.
Maybe that’s what you want me to feel.	Boya iyẹn ni o fẹ ki emi lero.
Lots and lots of surprises.	Pupọ ati ọpọlọpọ iyalẹnu.

You start to pull things out of it.	O bẹrẹ lati fa awọn nkan jade ninu rẹ.
We need to get back to the material.	A nilo lati pada si nkan elo.

You have been working on this for months.	O ti n ṣiṣẹ lori eyi fun awọn oṣu.
Your mother will be there any minute.	Iya rẹ yoo wa ni eyikeyi iṣẹju.
These days, most people live in one city.	Awọn ọjọ wọnyi, ọpọlọpọ eniyan n gbe ni ilu kan.
There is not much you can do until then.	Ko si ohun pupọ ti o le ṣe titi di igba naa.

From the top of the room could not see much.	Lati oke yara naa ko le ri pupọ.
It's not a bad thing.	Ko ṣe ohun buburu.
But we all know that life is not like that.	Ṣugbọn gbogbo wa mọ pe igbesi aye ko dabi iyẹn.
These things sometimes happen, it can't really help you.	Nkan wọnyi ma ṣẹlẹ, ko le gan ran o.
We need to bring our own people together.	A nilo lati mu awọn eniyan ti ara wa papọ.

I was stopped by a police officer.	Ọlọpa ọna opopona kan duro mi.
As you can see, there are others.	Bi o ṣe ṣe akiyesi, awọn miiran wa.
I always see how my body feels.	Mo nigbagbogbo rii bi ara mi ṣe lero.
He could not put himself in their place.	Ko le fi ara rẹ si aaye wọn.
But it picks up some good points.	Ṣugbọn o gbe diẹ ninu awọn aaye to dara.
And when you grow that person, become something else.	Ati nigbati o ba dagba eniyan yẹn, di nkan miiran.
Not to try to make people happy.	Ko lati gbiyanju lati ṣe eniyan dun.
There were two policemen there.	Awọn ọlọpa meji kan wa nibẹ.
This is too small.	Eyi kere ju.
I can be.	Mo le jẹ.
This has to stop.	Eyi ti ni lati da.
Someone put a drink in it.	Ẹnikan fi ohun mimu sinu rẹ.
I do not like any of them.	Emi ko nifẹ ọkan ninu wọn.

He turned off the light.	O si pa ina.
Some of them are.	Diẹ ninu wọn jẹ.

If you sit too long, you will become hard.	Ti o ba joko gun ju, iwọ yoo di lile.

I don’t even think about it anymore.	Emi ko paapaa ronu nipa rẹ mọ.
You can not ask me to leave this house.	O ko le beere lọwọ mi lati lọ kuro ni ile yii.
Now you are gone.	Bayi o ti lọ.
You can work again.	O le ṣiṣẹ lẹẹkansi.
The simple question is how to become strong.	Ibeere ti o rọrun ni bi o ṣe le di agbara.
Things don't work out for me.	Awọn nkan ko ṣiṣẹ fun mi.
If it is for fast room, we have !.	Ti o ba jẹ fun yara yara, a ni!.
I used to go up.	Mo ti lo soke.

It helps to see things through the eyes of a child.	O ṣe iranlọwọ lati rii awọn nkan nipasẹ oju ọmọde.
It is time for relaxation.	O jẹ akoko fun isinmi.
He was not afraid that the dog would hurt him.	O ko bẹru pe aja yoo ṣe ipalara fun u.
Not if these men have anything to say about it.	Kii ṣe ti awọn ọkunrin wọnyi ba ni ohunkohun lati sọ nipa rẹ.
They think he will come back.	Wọn ro pe yoo pada wa.
You should have seen their faces.	O yẹ ki o ti wo oju wọn.
A point out of time.	A aaye jade ti akoko.
You do not want to know a name.	O ko fẹ mọ orukọ kan.
I live near a river.	Mo n gbe nitosi odo.
Both sides saw an opportunity that was not there.	Awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji ri anfani ti ko si nibẹ.
There are more cars on the road than ever before.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ diẹ sii wa ni opopona ju lailai.
But they did not listen.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko gbọ.
There is no charge for that.	Ko si owo fun iyẹn.
I believe he will be able to.	Mo gbagbọ pe oun yoo ni anfani lati.
You did not kill him.	Iwọ ko pa a.
You are also my child.	Iwọ tun jẹ ọmọ mi.
Some people believe that such a person should drink.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan gbagbọ pe iru eniyan yẹ ki o mu.
Please visit and try again.	Jọwọ ṣabẹwo si gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
Nothing powerful.	Ko si ohun ti o ni agbara.
It is very rewarding.	O jẹ ere pupọ.
Nothing happened by accident.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nipa ijamba.
Make the most of your strength.	Ṣe anfani pupọ julọ ti agbara rẹ.
It takes a lot of time.	O gba akoko pupọ.
He was able to complete the task.	O ni anfani lati pari iṣẹ naa.
I thought such bad.	Mo ro iru buburu.
That was until this year.	Ti o wà titi odun yi.
However, one always encounters one of these conditions.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọkan nigbagbogbo pade ọkan ninu awọn ipo wọnyi.
It is on the books.	O wa lori awọn iwe.
Only a few schools bring in money.	Diẹ ninu awọn ile-iwe nikan ni o mu owo wa.
But nothing has changed on this.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o yipada lori eyi.
This is what happened here tonight.	Eyi ni ohun to ṣẹlẹ nibi ni alẹ oni.
But that day did not come.	Ṣugbọn ọjọ yẹn ko de.
This is important.	Eyi ṣe pataki.
At least, not too long.	O kere ju, ko pẹ.
I do not know how to do this.	Emi ko mọ bi a ṣe le ṣe eyi.
It is an essential nutrient for the human body.	O jẹ ounjẹ pataki fun ara eniyan.
It tired me like a dog.	O rẹ mi bi aja.
If you need such, just say a word.	Ti o ba nilo iru, kan sọ ọrọ kan.
Is there anyone in your family?	Njẹ ẹnikan kan ninu idile rẹ bi?
All companies are for this purpose only.	Gbogbo ile-iṣẹ wa fun idi yẹn nikan.
I'm sure you will do well.	Mo ni idaniloju pe iwọ yoo ṣe daradara.
At least it should take longer.	O kere ju o yẹ ki o gba to gun.
He drank some water.	O mu omi kan.
I will also have my children.	Emi yoo tun ni awọn ọmọ mi.
You can't hear yourself.	O ko le gbọ ara rẹ.

There is a problem.	Iṣoro kan lo wa.
He told me to take anything.	O sọ fun mi pe ki n gba ohunkohun.
It was hard to tell.	O je gidigidi lati so fun.
I do so often.	Mo n ṣe bẹ nigbagbogbo.
Or you have made time.	Tabi o ti ṣe akoko.
Well, pretty much.	Daradara, lẹwa Elo.
I had not seen him for several hours.	Emi ko tii ri i fun awọn wakati pupọ.
No room, a bed.	Ko yara, ibusun kan.
And so you will.	Ati bẹ iwọ yoo.
They will all sleep there tonight for the first time.	Gbogbo wọn yoo sun nibẹ ni alẹ oni fun igba akọkọ.
He threw and turned in his bed, unable to sleep.	O ju o si yipada ni ibusun rẹ, ko le sun.
Players take the time.	Awọn ẹrọ orin ya awọn akoko.
And it has been.	Ati pe o ti wa.
It was something to say.	O je nkankan lati sọ.
The power company was called in to repair the machine.	A pe ile-iṣẹ agbara lati tun ẹrọ naa ṣe.
Once this boy killed his brother.	Ni igba kan ọmọkunrin yii pa arakunrin rẹ.
It is a story they will tell to the boys in the family.	O jẹ itan ti wọn yoo sọ fun awọn ọmọkunrin ninu idile.

I am very happy with it.	Inu mi dun pupọ pẹlu rẹ.
They last a few minutes.	Wọn ṣiṣe ni iṣẹju diẹ.
When they are young, they are full of life.	Nigbati wọn ba wa ni ọdọ, wọn kun fun igbesi aye.
He was always such a good kid.	O nigbagbogbo jẹ ọmọ to dara bẹ.
It can make or break the situation.	O le ṣe tabi fọ ipo naa.
You need to take care of yourself.	O nilo lati tọju ara rẹ.
That’s their whole point.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo aaye wọn.
He was surprised by them.	O ya nipasẹ wọn.
Words do not matter.	Awọn ọrọ ko ṣe pataki.
My story is full of them.	Itan mi ti kun pẹlu wọn.
That is for today.	Iyẹn jẹ fun oni.
This was bad enough for him.	Eleyi je buburu to fun u.
It takes a while.	O gba igba diẹ.
My energy is something else completely different.	Agbara mi jẹ nkan miiran patapata.
Nothing ever out of nothing.	Ko si ohun lailai jade ti ohunkohun.
I do not agree.	Emi ko gba.
It's too late.	O ti kọja akoko.
Either way we are not at home.	Ni ọna kan ko wa ni ile.
However, the program did not work.	Sibẹsibẹ, eto naa ko ṣiṣẹ.
So they do not know.	Nitorina wọn ko mọ.
He was afraid and he treated us.	O bẹru ati pe o tọju wa.
Not so in this book.	Ko ri bẹ ninu iwe yi.
We like this man very much.	A fẹ ọkunrin yi gidigidi.
And it may be more true to that.	Ati pe o le jẹ otitọ diẹ si iyẹn.
They have no other reason.	Wọn ko ni idi miiran.
Lots of books.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe.
He came out and took pictures.	O si jade ti o ya awọn aworan.
I tell you to stay near the phone.	Mo sọ fun ọ pe ki o duro nitosi foonu naa.
But they did not help.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko ṣe iranlọwọ.
You and your brother.	Iwọ ati arakunrin rẹ.
I think it will not stop.	Mo ro pe kii yoo da duro.
The sister is very nice.	Arabinrin naa dara pupọ.
He talked and talked, but he said something.	O sọrọ ati sọrọ, ṣugbọn o sọ diẹ ninu nkan.
But just open your mind a little.	Ṣugbọn kan ṣii ọkan rẹ diẹ.
You are the only one who died.	Iwọ nikan ni o ku.
Yoo ku.	Yoo ku.
You know what it is now.	O mọ ohun ti o jẹ bayi.
They do not stand for water or food.	Wọn ko duro fun omi tabi ounjẹ.
To be.	Lati jẹ.
Call yours too !.	Pe tirẹ pẹlu!.
But it does not do much work.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe iṣẹ pupọ.
They wait for days.	Wọn duro fun awọn ọjọ.
I know you well.	Mo mọ ọ daradara.
However, they are not enough, they are personal.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn kii ṣe ohun to, wọn jẹ ti ara ẹni.
Do a.	Ṣe a.
This is understandable.	Eyi jẹ oye.
So we thought.	Nitorina a ro.
To get it right, you need a lot of work.	Lati gba o tọ, o nilo iṣẹ pupọ.
I am not sure there is anything else.	Emi ko da mi loju pe ohunkohun miiran wa.
He will go home when the work is done.	Oun yoo lọ si ile nigbati iṣẹ naa ba ti pari.
I definitely saw that.	Mo dajudaju rii iyẹn.
There is no legal requirement.	Ko si ibeere ofin.
A member from his sister's family called.	Ọmọ ẹgbẹ kan lati idile arabinrin rẹ pe.
However, it is an important book.	Sibẹsibẹ, o jẹ iwe pataki kan.
It's very simple.	O rọrun pupọ.
You will not have trouble.	Iwọ kii yoo ni wahala.
Only you can make these decisions and live with them.	Iwọ nikan ni o le ṣe awọn ipinnu wọnyi ki o gbe pẹlu wọn.
To do this one time again.	Lati ṣe eyi ni akoko kan lẹẹkansi.
I can not do it alone.	Emi ko le ṣe nikan.
This accident has completely changed.	Ijamba yii ti yipada patapata.
'in'.	'ni'.
Everyone will laugh at you.	Gbogbo eniyan yoo rẹrin si ọ.
Surprise.	Iyalẹnu.
But this is not about that.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe nipa iyẹn.
I do not want to know anything about them.	Emi ko fẹ lati mọ nkankan nipa wọn.
We get a plan.	A gba eto kan.
Your job is not to change the position of the parties.	Iṣẹ rẹ kii ṣe lati yi ipo ti awọn ẹgbẹ pada.
You could say that people have been there for a while.	O le sọ pe awọn eniyan ti wa nibẹ fun igba diẹ.
The cat broke, holding his head in his arms.	Ọmọ ologbo naa fọ, o n pa ori rẹ mọ ọwọ rẹ.
You can't say why, but it's too late.	O ko le sọ idi rẹ, ṣugbọn o ti pẹ ju.
So think about that.	Nitorina ronu nipa iyẹn.
In fact, we had a wonderful tea.	Ni otitọ, a ni tii iyanu kan.
My parents drove me here.	Awọn obi mi wakọ mi nibi.
His parents had nothing to give him.	Awọn obi rẹ ko ni nkankan lati fun u.
He became a teacher.	O di olukọ.
They need attention and rest, and they can pull through.	Wọn nilo akiyesi ati isinmi, ati pe wọn le fa nipasẹ.
And we have such games.	Ati pe a ni iru awọn ere.
Let me tell you what happened.	Jẹ ki n sọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ fun ọ.
With their families.	Pẹlu awọn idile wọn.
Sometimes you can’t even believe your eyes.	Nigba miiran o ko le gbagbọ oju rẹ paapaa.
Take note of your situation.	Ṣe akiyesi ipo rẹ.
I don’t even know what it is.	Emi ko paapaa mọ kini o jẹ.
You look at it.	O wo lori rẹ.
He knows the place well.	O mọ ibi naa daradara.
It passed to me.	O ti kọja si mi.
And on.	Ati lori.
You can not say no.	O ko le sọ rara.
I just found this program recently.	Mo kan rii eto yii laipẹ.
I am trying to write this book.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ko iwe yi.
He took pictures of everyone at all possible.	O si mu awọn aworan ti gbogbo eniyan ni gbogbo ti ṣee.
That could mean money for their family.	Iyẹn le tumọ si owo fun idile wọn.
They are not completely wrong.	Wọn kii ṣe aṣiṣe patapata.
Most people want to help everyone.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan fẹ lati ran gbogbo eniyan lọwọ.
I give you the whole world.	Mo fun yin ni gbogbo aye.
I love it more than the day we got married.	Mo nifẹ rẹ gaan ju ọjọ ti a ṣe igbeyawo lọ.
The observation ensures that no one will be harmed.	Akiyesi naa ṣe idaniloju pe ko si ẹnikan ti yoo ṣe ipalara.
Make sure to pick up the last bus.	Rii daju lati mu ọkọ akero ti o kẹhin.
It may not be a good thing, but it is there.	O le ko ni le kan ti o dara, sugbon o jẹ nibẹ.
There is nothing like that.	Ko si nkankan bi iyẹn.
He walked fast, but not fast.	O rin sare, sugbon ko sare.
You don't see it anymore.	O ko ri o mọ.
Man, everyone loves it.	Eniyan, gbogbo eniyan nifẹ rẹ.
It is better not to see them regularly.	Dara ki o ma ri wọn nigbagbogbo.
Let’s have a plan.	Jẹ ki a ni eto.
It is that power.	O jẹ agbara naa.
He has not moved.	O ti ko gbe.
Take a look.	Gba eniyan wo.
They are around your city.	Wọn wa ni ayika ilu rẹ.
They climbed from their seats in the train.	Wọn gun lati awọn ijoko wọn ninu ọkọ oju irin.
You're right.	O tọ.
I was afraid to talk to him again.	Mo bẹru lati ba a sọrọ pada.
There is a great story behind this.	Itan nla kan wa lẹhin eyi.
It's a 'by now.	O jẹ a 'nipasẹ bayi.
The time has come.	Akoko ipinnu ti de.
Will come when they go.	Yoo wa gba nigbati wọn ba lọ.
Something went wrong.	Nkankan ro aṣiṣe.
Human space has many human names.	Aaye eniyan ni awọn orukọ pupọ ti eniyan.
You do not give.	O ko fun ni.
It changed again.	O yi pada lẹẹkansi.
I think not.	Mo ro ko.
Everyone has something on their job to worry about.	Gbogbo eniyan ni nkankan lori iṣẹ wọn lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
They are used only by us.	Wọn ti wa ni lo nikan nipa wa.
His father called.	Baba rẹ pe.
And they help each other.	Ati pe wọn ran ara wọn lọwọ.
No one knows what to do.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ kini lati ṣe.
Let's work it out.	Jẹ ká ṣiṣẹ o jade.
He did, but little by little.	O ṣe, ṣugbọn diẹ diẹ.
So much so, a very interesting place.	Nitorina pupọ, aaye ti o nifẹ pupọ.
That, however, is not the case here.	Iyẹn, sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe ipo nibi.
There is no engagement on either side.	Ko si adehun igbeyawo ni gbogbo awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji.
But not in time.	Ṣugbọn ko si ni akoko.
Here’s how it goes here.	Eyi ni bi o ṣe lọ nibi.
Please lift your hair and look here, please.	Jọwọ gbe irun rẹ ki o wo ibi, jọwọ.
You have a job.	O ni ise kan.
You just won't listen.	O kan yoo ko gbọ.
Just an accident.	O kan ijamba.
He did not think.	Ko ro.
No one can tell us at all.	Ko si ẹniti o le sọ fun wa rara.
I will hate this moment in my entire life.	Emi yoo korira akoko yii ni gbogbo igbesi aye mi.
But that was not the case when we were growing up.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ri bẹ nigba ti a dagba.
Not nearly enough.	Ko fẹrẹ to.
You do not know until you try.	O ko mọ titi ti o gbiyanju.
Our celebration continues upwards.	Ayẹyẹ wa tẹsiwaju si oke.
People have grown up with us.	Awọn eniyan ti dagba si wa.
You are the one who is not.	Iwọ ni ẹni ti kii ṣe.
You can help if you need it.	O le ṣe iranlọwọ ti o ba nilo rẹ.
And you can write a lot of stuff with them.	Ati pe o le kọ ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan pẹlu wọn.
I have an idea.	Mo ni ero kan.
I can ask my friend.	Mo le beere lọwọ ọrẹ mi.
It works when you want.	O ṣiṣẹ nigbati o ba fẹ.
He did a lot and a lot of times.	O ṣe pupọ pupọ ati ọpọlọpọ igba.
This is a great opportunity.	Eyi jẹ anfani nla.
Everyone has something to keep.	Gbogbo eniyan ni nkankan lati tọju.
Our lives are better now.	Igbesi aye wa dara julọ ni bayi.
Born on this plane.	Bi lori ofurufu yi.
You are correcting the error.	O ti n tun aṣiṣe naa ṣe.
Surprise is very great.	Iyalẹnu jẹ nla pupọ.
They never met again.	Wọn ko pade lẹẹkansi.
He called to talk to me.	O pe lati ba mi sọrọ.
Proceed with life.	Tẹsiwaju pẹlu igbesi aye.
But the school has refused to let him in.	Ṣugbọn ile-iwe naa ti kọ lati jẹ ki o wọ.
There is so much to explain and do.	Ọpọlọpọ wa lati ṣe alaye ati ṣe.
I can see he is still angry.	Mo le rii pe o tun binu.
The watch was given to him as a gift.	A fi aago naa fun u bi ẹbun.
It's very simple.	O rọrun pupọ.
So we will have that.	Nitorina a yoo ni iyẹn.
And her shoes are amazing.	Ati awọn bata rẹ jẹ ohun iyanu.
He grew up with two brothers.	O dagba pẹlu awọn arakunrin meji.
Please give him your seat.	Jọwọ fun u ni ijoko rẹ.
She decided not to go home anymore.	O pinnu lati ma pada si ile mọ.
It was my first night in a while.	O jẹ alẹ akọkọ mi ni igba diẹ.
So let it.	Nitorina jẹ ki o.
Some of us do not.	Diẹ ninu wa ko ṣe.
You have noticed it.	O ti ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
Such methods are known.	Iru awọn ọna bẹẹ ni a mọ.
The artwork is in very good condition.	Iṣẹ ọna naa wa ni ipo ti o dara pupọ.
Not all are well.	Ko gbogbo wa ni daradara.
Now, sit down and listen.	Bayi, joko si isalẹ ki o gbọ.
Maybe someone told them.	Boya ẹnikan sọ fun wọn.
We tried everything.	A gbiyanju ohun gbogbo.
This new home needs a lot of work.	Ile tuntun yii nilo ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ.
You may want to read up on it.	O le fẹ lati ka soke lori rẹ.
It helps more than you realize.	O ṣe iranlọwọ diẹ sii ju ti o mọ.
I tried and tried.	Mo ti gbiyanju ati gbiyanju.
Everyone else knows, but not me.	Gbogbo eniyan miiran mọ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe emi.
Student testing was used.	A ti lo idanwo ọmọ ile-iwe.
But we have to send this money to him.	Sugbon a ni lati fi owo yi ranṣẹ si i.
It will do.	Yoo ṣe.
Get out of this city.	Jade kuro ni ilu yii.

It can do wonders for you.	O le ṣe ohun iyanu fun ọ.
Not much has changed.	Ko si pupọ ti yipada.

She has curly hair.	O ni irun ti o pada sẹhin.
I can’t do everything today or even this week.	Emi ko le ṣe ohun gbogbo loni tabi paapaa ni ọsẹ yii.
We are not here to place points.	A ko wa nibi lati gbe awọn aaye.
Not that you can.	Kii ṣe pe o le.
Of course you pick up some areas of interest.	Dajudaju o gbe diẹ ninu awọn aaye ti o nifẹ si.
This is too late to get out.	Eyi ti pẹ lati jade.
He accepted me.	O gba mi.
We played a little.	A dun diẹ.
The street doesn’t talk much there at the moment.	Ita naa ko sọrọ pupọ nibẹ ni akoko yii.
One more day, that’s all you need.	Ni ọjọ kan diẹ sii, iyẹn ni gbogbo ohun ti o nilo.
I had a great run there.	Mo ni ṣiṣe nla kan nibẹ.
She loves to make kids laugh.	O nifẹ lati jẹ ki awọn ọmọde rẹrin.
They ask for wisdom.	Wọn beere ọgbọn.

Use what you have.	Lo ohun ti o ni.
I wasn’t even trying to stop at this point.	Emi ko paapaa gbiyanju lati da duro ni akoko yii.

Under him were three men.	Labẹ rẹ̀ ni awọn ọkunrin mẹta wà.
I would be the last person to stand around.	Emi yoo jẹ eniyan ikẹhin lati duro ni ayika.
His eyes are fixed.	Oju rẹ ti wa titi.
Your body is not recovered.	A ko gba ara rẹ pada.
Your job is your life.	Iṣẹ rẹ ni igbesi aye rẹ.
But it will be less powerful,.	Ṣugbọn yoo jẹ kere si agbara, .
Whatever you do, start.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣe, bẹrẹ.
Only one thing is certain.	Ohun kan nikan ni idaniloju.
Always remember to brush your hair regularly.	Ranti nigbagbogbo lati fọ irun ori rẹ nigbagbogbo.
Whatever you need, whatever you want, say the words.	Ohunkohun ti o nilo, ohunkohun ti o fẹ, sọ awọn ọrọ.
Not worth anything less.	Ko tọ si nkankan kere.
Try something else.	Gbiyanju nkan miiran.

Maybe you will know something.	Boya o yoo mọ nkankan.
We may begin to believe that things will not change.	A le bẹrẹ lati gbagbọ pe awọn nkan kii yoo yipada.
But it can make a lot of sense for both sides.	Ṣugbọn o le ni oye pupọ fun awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji.

And if people are watching it, well, let them watch.	Ati pe ti awọn eniyan ba n wo rẹ, daradara, jẹ ki wọn wo.

I mean, we do, but we don’t.	Mo tumọ si, a ṣe, ṣugbọn a ko ṣe.
They can live without money.	Wọn le gbe laisi owo.
Not as surprising as its first, but also very good.	Ko ṣe iyalẹnu bi akọkọ rẹ, ṣugbọn tun dara pupọ.
You should give them a lot more than that.	O yẹ ki o fun wọn ni pupọ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
I’m not sure the guy meant anything bad by it.	Emi ko da mi loju pe eniyan naa tumọ ohunkohun buburu nipasẹ rẹ.

The company has been bankrupt for years.	Ile-iṣẹ naa ti kọ silẹ fun awọn ọdun.
Locals do not see it these days.	Awọn ọmọ agbegbe ko ri i ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.

Water is charged with electricity in this device.	Omi ti wa ni agbara pẹlu ina ni ẹrọ yi.

His eyes are fixed on her.	Oju rẹ duro lori.
There is no deadline on wisdom.	Ko si ipari ọjọ lori ọgbọn.
I feel that there is not enough information.	Mo lero pe ko si alaye to.
But they are also very small clothes.	Ṣugbọn wọn tun jẹ awọn aṣọ kekere pupọ julọ.
Or at least that’s what it looks like.	Tabi o kere ju iyẹn ni ohun ti o dabi.
Soon you will work hard to wonder about anything.	Laipẹ o yoo ṣiṣẹ pupọ lati ṣe iyalẹnu nipa ohunkohun.
Both closed their eyes.	Awọn mejeeji di oju wọn pa.
That would be a sight to behold.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ oju lati rii.

In fact, it is one of our favorite locations.	Ni otitọ, o jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ipo ayanfẹ wa.
You need to regain your strength.	O nilo lati tun ni agbara rẹ.

He did not eat much.	Ko jẹun pupọ.
And maybe it has been.	Ati boya o ti wa.
He has lived his life.	O ti gbe aye re.
You didn’t ask my question.	O ko beere ibeere mi.
But they will come.	Ṣugbọn wọn yoo wa.
My brother did.	Arakunrin mi ṣe.
Someone wants to talk.	Eniyan kan fẹ lati sọrọ.
He had picked up a bit to see her on his way.	O ti gbe soke diẹ lati ri i ni ọna rẹ.
He can't say he's even there.	Ko le sọ pe o wa nibẹ paapaa.
They have been there for a few hours, at least.	Wọn ti wa nibẹ fun awọn wakati diẹ, o kere ju.
He remembers when the house was new.	O ranti nigbati ile naa jẹ tuntun.
Some of these methods are not very easy to understand.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọna wọnyi ko rọrun pupọ lati ni oye.
We should get back to our jobs.	A yẹ ki o pada si awọn iṣẹ wa.
He died about two days later.	O ku nipa ọjọ meji lẹhin.
I don't have much time this afternoon.	Emi ko ni akoko pupọ ni ọsan yii.
They jumped out at him on the bus.	Wọn fo jade ni i lori ọkọ akero.
But it was one of many in the last two months.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ọkan ninu ọpọlọpọ ni awọn oṣu meji sẹhin.
I have my life back.	Mo ni aye mi pada.
If you do not know.	Ti o ko ba mọ.
I want to hear an old story.	Mo fẹ gbọ itan atijọ kan.
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time.	Gbogbo eniyan n ni aṣiṣe lati igba de igba.
This day will be better.	Ọjọ yii yoo dara.
What I was told I told you.	Ohun ti a sọ fun mi ni mo sọ fun ọ.
I just want to.	Mo kan fẹ.
You are probably still waiting.	O ṣee ṣe pe o tun n duro de.
Do not be such a child.	Maṣe jẹ iru ọmọ bẹẹ.
That also changed.	Iyẹn tun yipada.
We need them both.	A nilo wọn mejeeji.
Too many probably.	Ju ọpọlọpọ jasi.
She looked at her dog.	O wo aja rẹ.
It just is.	O kan jẹ.
But still fun.	Sugbon si tun fun.

Don't like them here yet.	Maṣe fẹ wọn nibi sibẹsibẹ.
I want to talk to your mother.	Mo fẹ lati ba iya rẹ sọrọ.
Just one or two should do.	O kan tabi meji yẹ ki o ṣe.
Maybe that is not the best way to do it.	Boya iyẹn kii ṣe ọna ti o dara julọ lati ṣe.
Everything they out.	Ohun gbogbo ti wọn jade.
This is a most interesting book.	Eleyi jẹ a julọ awon iwe.
Everyone let us know what you think.	Gbogbo eniyan jẹ ki a mọ ohun ti o ro.
I need to get home and make dinner.	Mo nilo lati de ile ati ṣe ounjẹ alẹ.
It has everything you could ever want.	O ni ohun gbogbo ti o le lailai fẹ.
I was a little boy, no one said anything to me.	Ọmọ kekere ni mi, ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ohunkohun fun mi.
If so, he will accept it.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹẹ, oun yoo gba.
You will understand and understand.	Iwọ yoo ni oye ati oye.
That’s pretty much what it seems to be happening.	Iyẹn lẹwa Elo ohun ti o dabi pe o n ṣẹlẹ.
Some hours away.	Diẹ ninu awọn wakati kuro.
Whatever happens must happen because something has caused it to happen.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ gbọdọ ṣẹlẹ nitori ohun kan ti mu ki o ṣẹlẹ.
My ears are ringing.	Eti mi dun.
Before all this, return when life is easy.	Ṣaaju gbogbo eyi, pada nigbati igbesi aye rọrun.
Citizens are on our side.	Awọn ara ilu wa ni ẹgbẹ wa.
We have never seen the world.	A ko ri aye ri.
People are very important.	Awọn eniyan ṣe pataki pupọ.
That's how sweet it is.	Bi o ṣe dun niyẹn.
We do not do this now.	A ko ṣe eyi ni bayi.
We had.	Ati.
The same thing applies the other way around.	Ohun kanna ni ọna miiran ni ayika.
The world has completely changed on its head.	Aye ti yipada patapata lori ori rẹ.
Look at another man.	Ọkunrin miiran wo.
Just ask a question.	O kan beere ibeere kan.
This turned out to be your last night.	Eyi yipada lati jẹ alẹ rẹ ti o kẹhin.
You have to open your gift picture.	O ni lati ṣii aworan ẹbun rẹ.
They will be around the same age.	Wọn yoo wa ni ayika ọjọ ori kanna.
He is happy.	Inu re dun.
Often they will just walk away.	Nigbagbogbo wọn yoo kan rin kuro.
People are angry.	Awọn eniyan binu.
It was the most important moment of my career life.	O jẹ akoko pataki julọ ti igbesi aye iṣẹ mi.
Things were good.	Ohun wà ti o dara.
Keep us in front of the shops.	Pa wa ni iwaju ti awọn itaja.
Be honest with who you are.	Jẹ otitọ si ẹniti o jẹ.
I need to show you something.	Mo nilo lati fi nkan han ọ.
I wish you did.	Mo fẹ pe o ṣe.
He did so.	O ṣe bẹ.
Everyone is happy.	Inu gbogbo eniyan dun.
The eyes do an important job.	Awọn oju ṣe iṣẹ pataki kan.
I find this very helpful.	Mo rii pe eyi ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
Okay, we are here first.	O dara, a wa nibi akọkọ.
So you need to change.	Nitorina o nilo lati yipada.
It was a beautiful day.	O je kan lẹwa ọjọ.
I have been watching it for two years.	Mo ti n wo e fun ọdun meji.
The water evaporates in a few minutes.	Omi naa yọ kuro ni iṣẹju diẹ.
He came up.	O wa soke.
That has not happened.	Iyẹn ko ti ṣẹlẹ.
It turns out to be a very difficult problem.	O ti jade lati jẹ iṣoro ti o nira pupọ.
Who on earth would eat all my food?	Tani lori ile aye ti njẹ gbogbo ounjẹ mi?
Very high.	Giga pupọ.
There is something here that has never been seen before.	Ohun kan wa nibi ti ko tii ri tẹlẹ.
It was early in the morning.	O je kutukutu owurọ.
Your 30 minutes.	Ọgbọn iṣẹju rẹ.
I completely agree with that one.	Mo ti gba patapata pẹlu ti ọkan.
Okay, let me start again.	O dara, jẹ ki n bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
I have a job and a daughter.	Mo ni iṣẹ kan ati ọmọbirin kan.
We are one of the last.	A jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ti o kẹhin.
Someone has to go out.	Eniyan kan gbọdọ jade.
This was a special trip for him.	Eyi jẹ irin-ajo pataki fun u.
I built a body, as you can see in my plan below.	Mo kọ ara kan, bi o ti le rii ninu eto mi ni isalẹ.
The sister can also come back.	Arabinrin naa tun le pada wa.
We can eat outside in the summer.	A le jẹun ni ita ni igba ooru.
It doesn't work out of the box.	Ko ṣiṣẹ lati inu apoti.
That is very bad news.	Iyẹn jẹ iroyin buburu pupọ.
The house will be used for housing.	Ile naa yoo lo fun ile.
It was a proper sun.	O jẹ oorun ti o yẹ.
I have heard a lot.	Mo ti gbọ pupọ.
By the time you finish this, it will be night.	Ni akoko ti o ba pari eyi, yoo jẹ alẹ.
This may be true.	Eyi le jẹ otitọ.
If they can only.	Ti wọn ba le nikan.
You do not have.	O ko ni.
You better go without us.	O dara ki o lọ laisi wa.
I don’t think it was.	Emi ko ro pe o je.
And the best of the three is love.	Ati awọn ti o dara ju ti awọn mẹta ni ife.
I want her to feel that well.	Mo fẹ rẹ lati lero wipe daradara.
Be nice to your children.	Jẹ dara si awọn ọmọ rẹ.
Will you contact the station.	Ṣe iwọ yoo kan si ibudo naa.
You don’t need to play that game.	O ko nilo lati ṣe ere yẹn.
He would have feared her forever.	Oun yoo ti bẹru rẹ lailai.
What do they know ?.	Kini wọn mọ?.
What you need will be there, and lots of it.	Ohun ti o nilo yoo wa nibẹ, ati ọpọlọpọ rẹ.
Just know them.	O kan mọ wọn.
They stopped and waited and waited.	Wọn duro ati duro ati duro.
You shouldn’t even think about it.	Ko yẹ ki o ronu rẹ paapaa.
You can get the amount you want.	O le gba iye ti o fẹ.
I'm glad to see you again.	Inu mi dun lati ri e lẹẹkansi.
This, however, is of little importance.	Eyi, sibẹsibẹ, jẹ pataki kekere.
And kill us.	Ki o si pa wa.
Be the person you want to remember years from now.	Jẹ eniyan ti o fẹ lati ranti awọn ọdun lati igba bayi.
To let him want you to go.	Lati jẹ ki o fẹ ki o lọ.
It has nothing and does not really work for anything.	Ko ni nkankan ati pe ko ṣiṣẹ gaan si ohunkohun.
He got up and got up.	O dide o si dide.
The costs of technology remain high.	Awọn owo ti ọna ẹrọ si maa wa ga.
I have been told that my whole life, and it is true.	Mo ti sọ fun mi pe gbogbo igbesi aye mi, ati pe o jẹ otitọ.
It has never been easier to find a boat.	Ko ti rọrun lati wa ọkọ oju omi.
Most come from the previous year.	Ọpọlọpọ wa lati ọdun ti tẹlẹ.
I want to know how it went with it.	Mo fẹ lati mọ bi o ti lọ pẹlu rẹ.
Maybe you have trouble sleeping tonight,	Boya o ni wahala lati sun ni alẹ oni,
It was a car accident that killed him.	O jẹ ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan ti o pa a.
But it’s not one of those, isn’t it.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọkan ninu iru bẹ, kii ṣe.
The game itself is sound.	Awọn ere ara jẹ ohun.
I just couldn’t because of the accident.	Mo kan ko le nitori ijamba naa.
I speak now.	Mo sọrọ ni bayi.
He doesn't seem to know much about the problem.	O dabi ẹni pe ko mọ pupọ nipa wahala naa.
No one out here.	Ko si ọkan jade nibi.
The last method should be here.	Ọna ikẹhin yẹ nibi.
The little ones may not.	Awọn kekere le ma ṣe.
Who knows what my mother looked like.	Tani o mọ bi iya mi ṣe ri.
When you think the world should stop, just move on.	Nigbati o ro pe aye yẹ ki o da, o kan tẹsiwaju.
Nothing else.	Ko si ohun miiran.
My family stands by me.	Idile mi ti o duro ti mi.
I can do better.	Mo le ṣe dara julọ.
It has many others.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran.
That is not what really happened.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ gaan.
You do both.	O ṣe awọn mejeeji.
We will get help soon.	A yoo wa iranlọwọ laipẹ.
The sister is not a doctor.	Arabinrin naa kii ṣe dokita kan.
Again, this may be my last life to speak up.	Lẹẹkansi, eyi le jẹ aye ikẹhin mi lati sọrọ soke.
Marriage and children see to that.	Igbeyawo ati awọn ọmọ ri si wipe.
He says there is no key.	O sọ pe ko si bọtini.
We want the past, or wish for what we do not have.	A fẹ ohun ti o ti kọja, tabi fẹ fun ohun ti a ko ni.
So much to bring him back, as well.	Ki diẹ lati mu u pada, bi daradara.
Some are very important.	Diẹ ninu jẹ pataki pupọ.
The bakery made amazing bread.	Ẹrọ akara ṣe akara iyanu.
What does it mean? 	Kini o jẹ?
No one likes highways.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹran awọn ọna opopona.
he wanted to know.	o fe lati mọ.
I have written this.	Mo ti kọ eyi.
We don’t need to pass on them.	A ko nilo lati kọja lori wọn.
This, of course, is wrong.	Eyi, dajudaju, ko tọ.
Ban all cars in the city.	Fi ofin de gbogbo awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ni ilu naa.
That is how we do it.	Bi a se n se niyen.
He was by his side for a minute.	O wa ni ẹgbẹ rẹ ni iṣẹju kan.
I just hope others learn from my mistakes.	Mo kan nireti pe awọn miiran yoo kọ ẹkọ lati aṣiṣe mi.
I have read the books he gave me.	Mo ti ka awọn iwe ti o fun mi.
There is nothing like a good book.	Ko si nkankan bi iwe to dara.
Our team will take care of it.	Ẹgbẹ wa yoo tọju rẹ.
You can't call them, because they don't have a phone.	O ko le pe wọn, nitori wọn ko ni foonu.
They both ate on their own.	Awọn mejeeji jẹun lori ara wọn.
Will laugh will laugh.	Yoo rẹrin yoo rẹrin.
Most of the time, we think we know something.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba, a ro pe a mọ nkan kan.
He met me at the port.	O pade mi ni ibudo.
Most are female.	Pupọ jẹ obinrin.
I could see what was happening around her.	Mo le rii ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ ni ayika rẹ.
To finish it, we have to change.	Lati pari rẹ, a ni lati yipada.
Lots of road to be home.	Pupọ ti opopona lati jẹ ile.
So enjoy yourself.	Nitorina gbadun ara rẹ.
He is a doctor by profession.	O jẹ dokita nipasẹ iṣẹ.
The only news outlets are not the police.	Awọn ibudo iroyin nikan kii ṣe ọlọpa.
You know it's true.	O mọ pe otitọ ni.
I know what they do.	Mo mọ ohun ti wọn ṣe.
The winter sun is beginning to set.	Oorun igba otutu ti bẹrẹ lati wọ.
I really made that decision.	Mo ṣe ipinnu yẹn gaan.
Think it is.	Ro pe o jẹ.
It will be.	Yoo dabi.
However, it is a good place to try.	Sibẹsibẹ, o jẹ aaye to dara lati gbiyanju.
Only my son stopped me.	Ọmọ mi nikan ni o da mi duro.
Okay, we just have to wait and see.	O dara, a kan ni lati duro ati rii.
Only one day a year are the same two.	Ni ọjọ kan nikan ni ọdun jẹ awọn meji kanna.
There are a lot of young people in it.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọdọ wa ninu rẹ.
It started soon.	O bẹrẹ laipẹ.
Until a year before three children were born at home.	Titi di ọdun kan ṣaaju ki wọn to bi ọmọ mẹta ni ile.
Past lessons	Awọn ẹkọ ti o ti kọja
It can also change.	O tun le yi pada.
They don’t know any other life at all.	Wọn ko mọ igbesi aye miiran rara.
That one thought one thought, one feeling one feeling.	Pe ero kan ero kan, rilara kan rilara kan.
I tried this but they are not the same.	Mo gbiyanju iru eyi ṣugbọn wọn kii ṣe kanna.
They have to deal with facts as they see fit.	Wọn gbọdọ ṣe pẹlu awọn otitọ bi wọn ṣe rii wọn.
Their severe injuries are the cause of great anxiety.	Awọn ipalara nla wọn jẹ idi fun aniyan nla.
They are not sure what is going on.	Wọn ko ni idaniloju ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
We all know that this time will come.	Gbogbo wa mọ pe akoko yii yoo de.
Do that for yourself, let us see you !.	Maṣe ṣe iyẹn fun ararẹ, jẹ ki a rii ọ!.
You have to believe.	O ni lati gbagbọ.
Your decisions are as final as yours.	Awọn ipinnu rẹ jẹ ipari bi tirẹ.
There are days when you can.	Awọn ọjọ wa ti o le.
You can’t miss it, either.	O ko le padanu rẹ, paapaa.
And you are completely down for that.	Ati pe o wa ni isalẹ patapata fun iyẹn.
She is in bed.	O wa lori ibusun.
One for others seeking that advice.	Kan fun awọn miiran n wa imọran yẹn.
On the one hand, we work with other people.	Ni ẹgbẹ kan, a ṣiṣẹ pẹlu awọn eniyan miiran.
It is always possible.	O ṣeeṣe nigbagbogbo wa.
I can leave my phone on the table and leave.	Mo le fi foonu mi silẹ lori tabili ki o lọ kuro.
I get us here.	Mo gba wa nibi.
I went to see her, but no one was there.	Mo lọ wo rẹ, ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o wa nibẹ.
And you will be here too.	Ati pe iwọ yoo wa nibi paapaa.
I would like to connect those points.	Emi yoo fẹ ki a so awọn aaye yẹn.
But it has not arrived yet.	Ṣugbọn ko ti de sibẹsibẹ.
He doesn't want me to tell you.	Ko fe ki n so fun yin.
All dogs can be great.	Gbogbo awọn aja le jẹ nla.
But you know what to do.	Ṣugbọn o mọ ohun lati ṣe.
And it is not intended to harm anyone.	Ati pe kii ṣe ipinnu lati ṣe ipalara fun ẹnikẹni.
I know my husband.	Mo mọ ọkọ mi.
He is looking at himself.	O n wo ara re.
But more information is needed.	Ṣugbọn a nilo alaye diẹ sii.
I have never heard anything like it.	Emi ko tii gbọ ohunkohun bi rẹ.
Essentially, you just can’t make this thing up.	Ni pataki, o kan ko le ṣe nkan yii soke.
I remember this time as it was yesterday.	Mo ranti akoko yii bi o ti jẹ lana.
Let me prove my point.	Jẹ ki n fi idi ero mi han.
This is what you will see.	Eyi ni iwọ yoo rii.
When he looked at the room, he remembered that they had lived there.	Nigbati o wo yara naa, o ranti pe wọn gbe nibẹ.
Never seen it before.	Ko ri i tẹlẹ.
The doctor said no more.	Dokita ko sọ mọ.
Did you enjoy dinner?	Ṣe o gbadun ounjẹ alẹ oni?
Here it means the highest good.	Nibi o tumọ si pe o ga julọ ti o dara julọ.
He just said they sent him home from school.	O kan sọ pe wọn ran oun lọ si ile lati ile-iwe.
They can use the money the way they want.	Wọn le lo owo naa ni ọna ti wọn fẹ.
That's enough.	O ti to eyi.
Please help if you have already done something like this.	Jọwọ ṣe iranlọwọ ti o ba ti ṣe nkan bii eyi tẹlẹ.
Word is not possible.	Ọrọ ko ṣee ṣe.
My doctor had told me he did not know what to do.	Dokita mi ti sọ fun mi pe ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
Water, water and more water!	Omi, omi ati omi diẹ sii!
You will stop at nothing to understand.	Iwọ yoo da duro ni ohunkohun lati ni oye.
By now you’ve said more.	Nipa bayi o ti sọ diẹ.
But he did not.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe bẹẹ.
Broken again.	Ti fọ lẹẹkansi.
As for my dad, well, it’s simple.	Bi fun baba mi, daradara, o rọrun.
The children are excited about their upcoming school trip.	Inu awọn ọmọde dun nipa irin-ajo ile-iwe wọn ti n bọ.
But there may be others.	Ṣugbọn awọn miiran le wa.
You know, with the girl.	O mọ, pẹlu ọmọbirin naa.
My husband learned history.	Ọkọ mi kọ ẹkọ itan.
They cannot help us.	Wọn ko le ran wa lọwọ.
To give him what he wants.	Lati fun u ni ohun ti o fẹ.
Let's just wait.	Jẹ ká kan duro.
I have two of my own.	Mo ni meji ti ara mi.
One month, it is possible.	Oṣu kan, o ṣee ṣe.
He believed in working hard.	O gbagbọ lati ṣiṣẹ lile.
And with surprising surprise, a new force was born.	Ati pẹlu iyalẹnu iyalẹnu, a bi agbara tuntun kan.
He was very happy to his brothers.	O dun pupọ si awọn arakunrin rẹ.
You have to see and feel.	O ni lati ri ati lati lero.
You are in the wrong place.	O wa ni aaye ti ko tọ.
We must know that.	A gbọdọ mọ iyẹn.
When the program starts, it is simple.	Nigbati eto naa bẹrẹ, o rọrun.
All the work has to be done by yourself, only.	Gbogbo iṣẹ naa ni lati ṣe funrararẹ, nikan.
I always try to forget it.	Mo nigbagbogbo gbiyanju lati gbagbe rẹ.
Nothing they do should touch you at all.	Ko si ohun ti wọn ṣe yẹ ki o fi ọwọ kan ọ rara.
I just agree.	Mo kan gba.
Many people wonder about that one.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ṣe iyalẹnu nipa ọkan yẹn.
You don't like that.	O ko fẹran iyẹn.
Maybe you shouldn't be on it.	Boya o yẹ ki o ko ni le lori rẹ.
There is nothing else on it.	Ko si ohun miiran lori o.
He wouldn’t let me live below that.	Oun kii yoo jẹ ki n gbe ni isalẹ yẹn.
You can give yourself this time and this space.	O le fun ara rẹ ni akoko yii ati aaye yii.
Maybe we will be in the book.	Boya a yoo wa ninu iwe naa.
Very unaffected.	Pupọ ti ko ni eti.
It would not be of any benefit to him.	Kii ṣe pe yoo jẹ anfani eyikeyi fun u.
They are good together.	Wọn dara papọ.
However this is true.	Sibẹsibẹ eyi ni otitọ.
Lock yourself in.	Tii ara rẹ sinu.
He is the key.	Oun ni bọtini.
But of course it will.	Sugbon dajudaju o yoo.
It’s a way to think about it.	O jẹ ọna kan lati ronu rẹ.
Don’t tell me you don’t get it.	Maṣe sọ fun mi pe o ko gba.
Not sure how that happened.	Ko daju bi iyẹn ṣe ṣẹlẹ.
And years before, even.	Ati ọdun ṣaaju, paapaa.
He was arrested last night.	Won mu u ni alẹ ana.
Most people get into it.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan gba sinu.
Everything they do to get students, care for them, and continue to grow.	Ohun gbogbo ti wọn ṣe lati gba awọn ọmọ ile-iwe, tọju wọn, ati tẹsiwaju lati dagba.
Maybe this is the key to what goes below.	Boya eyi jẹ bọtini si ohun ti o lọ ni isalẹ.
There are also girls.	Awọn ọmọbirin tun wa.
I have never seen anything like it.	Emi ko tii ri iru eyi ri.
I love me.	Mo nifẹ mi.
I don’t know if it’s true or not.	Emi ko mọ boya o jẹ otitọ tabi rara.
Something you want is there.	Nkan ti o fẹ wa nibẹ.
It's really beautiful.	O lẹwa gaan.
I will remove them.	Emi yoo ko wọn kuro.
You get first.	O gba akọkọ.
Of course not the money.	Dajudaju kii ṣe owo naa.
I make my own decisions.	Mo ṣe awọn ipinnu ti ara mi.
Hold the contract.	Di adehun naa.
Essentially, it was done very well by me.	Ni pataki, o ṣe daradara pupọ nipasẹ mi.
He wants to know you.	O fẹ lati mọ ọ.
We have to make a decision.	A ni lati ṣe ipinnu.
No, they can't let you see why.	Rara, wọn ko le jẹ ki o rii idi.
The name does not matter.	Orukọ naa ko ṣe pataki.
He told me how I could find the work.	O sọ fun mi bi mo ṣe le rii iṣẹ naa.
I live on my own.	Mo n gbe lori ara mi.
Something of what they have said has been left out.	Nkankan ti ohun ti wọn ti sọ ni a ti fi silẹ.
I did pretty well these days.	Mo ṣe lẹwa dara julọ awọn ọjọ.
A large hand came out of the sea.	Ọwọ nla kan jade lati inu okun.
I'm glad the game was stopped for me.	Inu mi dun pe a da ere naa duro fun mi.
Women were not allowed to drive at that time.	Wọn ko gba awọn obinrin laaye lati wakọ ni akoko yẹn.
Give me a moment to be with myself.	Fun mi ni akoko kan lati wa pẹlu ara mi.
In the end it was done.	Ni ipari o ti ṣe.
I did well in the summer in the past.	Mo ti ṣe daradara ninu ooru ni igba atijọ.
But he did, and he did.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe, o si ri bẹ.
If you want not to go.	Ti o ba fẹ ko lọ.
Now you know that something has happened.	Bayi o mọ pe ohun kan ti ṣẹlẹ.
You will do very well.	O yoo ṣe daradara pupọ.
You know, like this book.	O mọ, iru bii iwe yii.
I can help him grow that child, as he is my own.	Mo le ṣe iranlọwọ fun u lati dagba ọmọ yẹn, bi o ti jẹ ti ara mi.
This is not true at all.	Eyi kii ṣe otitọ rara.
Here is the story of two amazing lives.	Eyi ni itan ti awọn igbesi aye iyalẹnu meji.
They live in our area.	Wọn n gbe ni agbegbe wa.
Best friend.	Ọrẹ to dara julọ.
This can be more than just playing.	Eyi le ju bi o ti n dun lọ.
It would be so for two reasons.	Yoo jẹ bẹ fun idi meji.
And maybe books only for teachers.	Ati boya awọn iwe nikan fun awọn olukọ.
I do not want to do.	Emi ko fẹ lati ṣe.
A great job.	Iṣẹ nla kan.
Same with it.	Kanna pẹlu rẹ.
You know too.	O mọ ju.
That’s what you say.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti o sọ.
These pictures are really beautiful.	Awọn aworan wọnyi lẹwa gaan.
It surprised me when it was called.	O ya mi nigba ti o pe.
He will see.	Oun yoo ri.
There is something, even.	Nkankan wa, paapaa.
You can ask questions.	O le beere awọn ibeere.
I'm getting better.	Mo n dara diẹ sii.
This is a family here.	Eyi jẹ idile kan nibi.
He is in his heart because of it.	O wa ninu ọkan rẹ nitori rẹ.
Inside he is the same as a man.	Inu o jẹ kanna bi ọkunrin kan.
He could not use the device until this program was completed.	Ko le lo ẹrọ naa titi ti eto yii yoo fi pari.
He wants a house.	O fe ile.
No time, he thought.	Ko ni akoko, o ro.
Now the girls arrived.	Bayi awọn ọmọbirin de.
It’s about something you don’t see.	O jẹ nipa nkan ti o ko rii.
I just made up.	Mo kan ṣe soke.
Back to work.	Pada si iṣẹ.
This is an important issue.	Eyi jẹ ọrọ pataki.
Most of the money came back to us.	Pupọ julọ ti owo naa wa pada si wa.
They are more surprising even after rain.	Wọn jẹ iyalẹnu diẹ sii paapaa lẹhin ojo.
Let them come and get me.	Jẹ ki wọn wa gba mi.
Everyone wants it, but it depends on them.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o fẹ, ṣugbọn o gbe le wọn.
It can’t be anything serious.	Ko le jẹ ohunkohun to ṣe pataki.
Well not really.	Daradara ko gan.
Nothing fast enough.	Ko si ohun ti o yara to.
I would love to hear them.	Emi yoo fẹ lati gbọ wọn.
Lots of work but it's worth it.	Ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ ṣugbọn o tọ ọ.
She loves her father.	O nifẹ baba rẹ.
It may take a long time, but you will be there.	O le nilo igba pipẹ, ṣugbọn iwọ yoo wa nibẹ.
Maybe you think you can get me, too.	Boya o ro pe o le gba mi, paapaa.
Now things have changed.	Bayi ohun ti yipada.
Everyone is laughing.	Gbogbo eniyan n rẹrin.
It shouldn’t be, but it does.	Ko yẹ ki o ni, ṣugbọn o ṣe.
She hated it so much.	O korira rẹ pupọ.
I feel like that.	Mo lero bi iyẹn.
You must do nothing.	O gbọdọ ṣe ohunkohun.
But he can't pull it off alone.	Ṣugbọn ko le fa kuro nikan.
These conditions are one of a kind.	Awọn ipo wọnyi jẹ ọkan ninu iru.
It has been several years since you visited the city.	O ti jẹ ọdun pupọ lati igba ti o ti ṣabẹwo si ilu naa.
Eye water.	Omi oju.
I can see them now.	Mo le rii wọn ni bayi.
It would have been much easier that way.	Yoo ti rọrun pupọ ni ọna yẹn.
He said he would change his mind.	O sọ pe oun yoo yi ọkan rẹ pada.
He has been living here for many years.	O ti n gbe nibi fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
You put yourself on.	O fi ti ara rẹ le lori.
Some people think it is a problem.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ro pe o jẹ iṣoro kan.
I went to work for another company.	Mo lọ ṣiṣẹ fun ile-iṣẹ miiran.
You get the wrong facts.	O gba awọn otitọ ti ko tọ.
I know you’re just doing your job.	Mo mọ pe o n ṣe iṣẹ rẹ nikan.
Books when something caught my eye.	Awọn iwe nigbati ohun kan mu oju mi.
It looks like a lot of equipment.	O dabi ẹrọ pupọ.
It is raining at night.	Ojo ti n ro ni alẹ.
There is so much to love here.	Pupọ wa lati nifẹ nibi.
So he went.	Nitorina o lọ.
The man does not have this thing.	Ọkunrin naa ko ni nkan yii.
This mother needs me now.	Iya yi nilo mi ni bayi.
You can only do so several times.	O le nikan ṣe bẹ ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
It's just me.	O kan re mi.
She is wearing an old-fashioned dress.	O ti wọ aṣọ ojo atijọ kan.
For now, such tables do not exist.	Fun bayi, iru awọn tabili ko si tẹlẹ.
The problem is, he can't say.	Iṣoro naa ni, ko le sọ.
We dressed like we wore clothes.	A wọ ara bi a ti wọ aṣọ.
And in most cases, there are not many people at this height.	Ati ni ọpọlọpọ igba, ko si ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni giga yii.
So he put it back on.	Nitorina o tun gbe e pada.
I deserve your consideration.	Mo ti yẹ iye ero rẹ.
Here they just get in the way.	Nibi wọn kan gba ọna.
I can't get this.	Nko le gba eyi.
We enjoy your time.	A ni anfani akoko rẹ.
Now just write "end" here.	Bayi o kan kọ "ipari" nibi.
I understand what is going on.	Mo loye ohun ti o n kọja.
He saw his sister for the first time in years.	O ri arabinrin rẹ fun igba akọkọ ni ọdun.
The last time someone asked that question.	Igba ikẹhin ti ẹnikan beere ibeere yẹn.
We need to.	A ni lati ṣe.
We changed our eyes.	A yi oju wa pada.
This box contains the ingredients.	Apoti yii ni awọn ohun elo ninu.
I know this because it happens to be my daughter.	Mo mọ eyi nitori pe o ṣẹlẹ lati jẹ ọmọbirin mi.
Obviously the game.	O han ni ere naa.
But why give all that money for love?	Ṣugbọn kilode ti o fi gbogbo owo naa fun ifẹ?
You should know that by now.	O yẹ ki o mọ pe ni bayi.
And get them.	Ati ki o gba wọn.
I just played it through.	Mo ti o kan dun o nipasẹ.
I love the doctor and he loves me.	Mo fẹran dokita ati pe o fẹran mi.
Watch a game and such a thing.	Wo ere kan ati iru nkan yẹn.
He died a minute later.	O ti ku ni iṣẹju kan.
Not good for me.	Ko dara fun mi.
I don’t see anyone like this.	Emi ko ri ẹnikẹni bi eleyi.
You have a dead game.	O ni ere ti o ku.
He seemed to think about it.	O dabi enipe o ronu nipa rẹ.
One foot.	Ẹsẹ kan.
I will not say anything.	Emi ko ni sọ ohunkohun.
The boy has no time to lose.	Ọmọkunrin ko ni akoko lati padanu.
It has a lot of cats.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ologbo.
There are few people in this area.	Awọn eniyan diẹ wa ni agbegbe yii.
If you step foot, you will be alive.	Ti o ba fi ẹsẹ jade, iwọ yoo wa laaye.
Inside, everything is a big room.	Ninu inu, ohun gbogbo jẹ yara nla kan.
You are not there yet.	Iwọ ko wa nibẹ sibẹsibẹ.
A lot of time and money and ideas go into this.	A Pupo ti akoko ati owo ati ero lọ sinu yi.
They tested the device thoroughly.	Wọn ṣe idanwo ẹrọ naa daradara.
But there are several ways around that.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọna pupọ wa ni ayika iyẹn.
So it was a worthwhile game.	Nitorina o jẹ ere ti o tọ.
We do so in several ways.	A ṣe bẹ ni awọn ọna pupọ.
Stay in bed, and work in your garden!	Duro ni ibusun, ki o si ṣiṣẹ ninu ọgba rẹ!
I can't find anything wrong there.	Mi o le rii ohun ti ko tọ nibẹ.
Summer is a great time to visit this area.	Ooru jẹ akoko ti o dara julọ lati ṣabẹwo si agbegbe yii.
What we do as a company is very important.	Ohun ti a ṣe bi ile-iṣẹ jẹ pataki gaan.
They will not.	Wọn kii yoo.
Remove from heat.	Yọ kuro ninu ooru.
Use the following to take advantage of the situation.	Lo awọn wọnyi lati lo anfani ti ipo naa.
We never say those words, but we don’t need to.	A ko sọ awọn ọrọ naa rara, ṣugbọn a ko nilo lati.
Listen for yourself !.	Fun ara rẹ gbọ!.
It is for you.	O jẹ fun ọ.
Nothing more to say.	Ko si ohun miiran lati sọ.
That’s where we’re going to live, he decided for us.	Iyẹn ni ibi ti a yoo gbe, o pinnu fun wa.
The car improved.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa dara si.
At this point a new girl comes to school.	Ni ipo yii ọmọbirin tuntun kan wa si ile-iwe.
This raises the question of what will work best.	Eyi mu iṣoro naa dide ti ohun ti yoo ṣiṣẹ dara julọ.
I understand the idea.	Mo loye ero naa.
Please give the matter some thought.	Jọwọ fun ọrọ naa ni ero diẹ.
Maybe they can live where they left off.	Boya wọn le gbe ibi ti wọn ti duro.
The site has two areas.	Aaye naa ni awọn agbegbe meji.
However, times changed.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn akoko yipada.
I tried this and it has worked twice.	Mo gbiyanju eyi ati pe o ti ṣiṣẹ ni igba meji.
He called again, again.	O tun pe, lẹẹkansi.
To put it bluntly, they arrived.	Lati fi si ọrọ kan, wọn de.
You know me very well.	O mọ mi daradara daradara.
Or keep them.	Tabi pa wọn mọ.
They eat and work, and start a family.	Wọn jẹun ati ṣiṣẹ, ati bẹrẹ idile.
I didn’t drink, at first.	Emi ko mu, ni akọkọ.
Good ideas are still good ideas.	Ti o dara ero ni o si tun ti o dara ero.
This is not why we intended for our game, of course.	Eyi kii ṣe idi ti a pinnu fun ere wa, dajudaju.
So you don't see it.	Nitorina o ko ri i.
But you can never be sure.	Ṣugbọn o ko le ni idaniloju rara.
You have heard him speak.	O ti gbọ ti o sọrọ.
But something wonderful happened recently.	Ṣugbọn ohun iyanu kan ṣẹlẹ laipẹ.
I do not agree again.	Emi ko tun gba.
You can have some if you want more.	O le ni diẹ ninu awọn ti o ba fẹ diẹ.
These houses have seen the best days.	Awọn ile wọnyi ti rii awọn ọjọ to dara julọ.
He made a note.	O ṣe akiyesi kan.
Of course I did not want to live for years with this obvious mistake.	Dajudaju Emi ko fẹ lati gbe fun ọdun pẹlu aṣiṣe ti o han gbangba yii.
Let me get it.	Jẹ ki n gba.
You may not know it yourself, in fact.	O le ma mọ funrararẹ, ni otitọ.
Go you go through, shoes it.	Lọ ti o lọ nipasẹ, awọn bata ti o.
I think she loves her husband.	Mo ro pe o nifẹ ọkọ rẹ.
Most of my classes, things have nothing to do with that station.	Pupọ ti awọn kilasi mi, awọn nkan ko ṣe pẹlu ibudo yẹn.
When we return home at this time.	Nigba ti a ba pada si ile ni akoko yii.
There is a lot of work to be done in this area.	Iṣẹ pupọ wa lati ṣe ni agbegbe yii.
Inside were the eyes of children who would never grow up.	Inu rẹ ni awọn oju ti awọn ọmọde ti kii yoo dagba soke.
I do not know where to go.	Emi ko mọ ibiti o ti le gbe lọ.
It will not be a problem at all for me.	Kii yoo jẹ iṣoro rara fun mi.
They also asked.	Wọn tun beere.
I want to have.	Mo fe lati ni.
I do not have to sit there and do nothing.	Emi ko ni lati joko nibẹ ko si ṣe ohunkohun.
They do not want to read about us.	Wọn ko fẹ lati ka nipa wa.
This site is for game purposes only.	Aaye yii wa fun awọn idi ere nikan.
To tell you.	Lati sọ fun ọ.
You can see the boy's head and face at this moment.	O le ri ori ati oju ọmọkunrin naa ni akoko yii.
We treat children with great care.	A tọju awọn ọmọde pẹlu akiyesi nla.
There is a lot of music here.	Orin pupọ lo wa nibi.
Their lives are also important.	Igbesi aye wọn tun ṣe pataki.
It will only take a few minutes.	Yoo gba to iṣẹju diẹ nikan.
I just want them to accept me.	Mo kan fẹ ki wọn gba mi.
They send their love.	Won ran ife won.
At least you know where you stand.	O kere ju o mọ ibiti o duro.
He does not like me.	Ko feran mi.
This is no small thing for me.	Eyi kii ṣe nkan kekere fun mi.
You can still do anything.	O tun le ṣe ohunkohun.
We have to build a new world.	A ni lati kọ aye tuntun kan.
Get some, lose some.	Gba diẹ ninu, padanu diẹ ninu.
And what a story it is.	Ati kini itan ti o jẹ.
What we may think is irrelevant.	Ohun ti a le ro ko ṣe pataki.
As time goes on, we love it.	Bi akoko ti n lọ, a nifẹ rẹ.
But he could not do any of it himself.	Ṣugbọn ko le ṣe eyikeyi funrararẹ.
They were born into it.	A bi wọn sinu rẹ.
Nothing happened.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It was a good price.	O je kan ti o dara owo.
Your father may have known, but he is gone.	Baba rẹ le ti mọ, ṣugbọn o ti lọ.
They have no such power.	Won ko ni iru agbara.
He doesn't want anything.	Ko fe nkankan.
Did you call the doctor?	Ṣe o pe fun dokita?
He said he was a friend.	O sọ pe ọrẹ kan ni.
I am writing a new book about my travels.	Mo n kọ iwe tuntun kan nipa awọn irin-ajo mi.
Now it is about information.	Bayi o jẹ nipa alaye.
Everyone around me is in trouble.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o wa ni ayika mi ni wahala.
I am anxious.	Emi ni aniyan.
She was afraid of herself.	O bẹru ti ara rẹ.
Get our attention.	Gba akiyesi wa.
I hope to see you again.	Mo nireti lati ri ọ lẹẹkansi.
If you do, you will not.	Ti o ba ṣe, iwọ kii ṣe.
What a surprise.	Kini iyalẹnu.
It takes about three minutes.	O gba to bii iṣẹju mẹta.
There is no reason to be there tonight.	Kii ṣe pe idi kan wa lati wa ni alẹ oni.
Okay, now they do.	O dara, ni bayi wọn ṣe.
It just hurts a lot every time you move.	O kan ṣe ipalara pupọ ni gbogbo igba ti o gbe.
But obviously we know it's coming.	Ṣugbọn o han gbangba pe a mọ pe o n bọ.
I do not deserve to live.	Emi ko yẹ lati gbe.
It is your story.	Itan rẹ ni.
That will just treat them.	Iyẹn yoo kan tọju wọn.
It was raining at the time.	Ojo ti n ro ni akoko naa.
Not sure on the end yet.	Ko daju lori ipari sibẹsibẹ.
Drinking water is essential for life.	Omi mimu jẹ pataki fun igbesi aye.
Nothing in this statement is true!	Ko si nkankan ninu ọrọ yii jẹ otitọ!
I have to help.	Mo ni lati ran.
It is a love.	O jẹ ifẹ kan.
And up.	We si oke.
Just feel the music.	O kan lero orin naa.
But others as well.	Ṣugbọn awọn miiran pẹlu.
Your child has not changed to a place of birth.	Ọmọ rẹ ko ti yipada si ipo ibi.
I thought maybe he would come and do that.	Mo ro boya o yoo wa ki o si ṣe pe.
I thought about that.	Mo ro nipa iyẹn.
But it does not seem to work.	Ṣugbọn o dabi pe ko ṣiṣẹ.
When he asked a question, he doubted.	Nigbati o beere ibeere kan, o ṣiyemeji.
They will tell you.	Wọn yoo sọ fun ọ.
That in itself tells me it won’t bring me back.	Iyẹn funrararẹ sọ fun mi pe ko ni mu mi pada.
I mean any image.	Mo tumọ si eyikeyi aworan.
That should be something to worry about, we think.	Iyẹn gbọdọ jẹ nkan lati ṣe aniyan nipa, a ro.
In this place.	Ninu ibi.
I would be happy to help you.	Inu mi yoo dun lati ran ọ lọwọ.
He married for two of the women, in fact.	O fẹ fun meji ninu awọn obinrin, ni otitọ.
Get out of their way.	Jade kuro ni ọna wọn.
I'll be out in a long, long time.	Emi yoo jade ni pipẹ, igba pipẹ.
The sun will soon set.	Oorun yoo wọ laipẹ.
However, the decision has been made.	Sibẹsibẹ, a ti ṣe ipinnu naa.
They will all pay off.	Gbogbo wọn yoo san.
It was the only fire that worked in the house.	O jẹ ina nikan ti o ṣiṣẹ ni ile naa.
That has not changed.	Iyẹn ko yipada.
It is not enough.	Ko ni to.
Only a few first.	Nikan diẹ akọkọ.
I can explain.	Mo le ṣe alaye.
It makes me angry.	O mu mi binu.
There it is	O wa
Walking around like this makes you feel similar.	Rin ni ayika bi eleyi jẹ ki o lero ti iru.
But that is what they are in my heart.	Ṣugbọn ohun ti wọn wa ninu ọkan mi niyẹn.
Which makes the name more meaningful.	Eyi ti o mu ki orukọ naa ni oye diẹ sii.
And try to make it look bad.	Ati ki o gbiyanju lati jẹ ki o dabi ẹni buburu.
Sorry can not do.	Ma binu ko le ṣe.
This will speed up.	Eyi yoo yara yara.
I went to the store before I got home.	Mo lọ si ile itaja ṣaaju ki mo to de ile.
He can't tell you right now.	Ko le sọ fun ọ ni bayi.
All in all a good time.	Gbogbo ni akoko ti o dara.
She turned to me, her eyes wide.	O yipada si mi, oju rẹ ṣe pataki.
This is the time you have been waiting for.	Eyi ni akoko ti o ti n duro de.
It can take two, three years.	O le ṣe meji, ọdun mẹta.
After your children? 	Lẹhin awọn ọmọ rẹ?
for anything else! 	fun ohunkohun miiran!
You can not see them.	O ko le ri wọn.
Or they do not believe it.	Tabi wọn ko gbagbọ rẹ.
Eat your food well.	Jẹ ounjẹ rẹ daradara.
I will always be better.	Emi yoo ma dara si.
I was very touched by their words.	Ọrọ wọn dun mi gidigidi.
It is not intended as such.	Ko ṣe ipinnu bi iru.
The fabric on the bed is tied at the feet.	Aṣọ ti o wa lori ibusun ni a so ni ẹsẹ.
At least they didn’t stop and gave me any trouble.	O kere wọn ko duro ati fun mi ni wahala eyikeyi.
Very good value.	Gan ti o dara iye.
I lost my eyesight.	Mo nu oju mi ​​nu.
Once you learn the rules, you can play the game.	Ni kete ti o kọ awọn ofin, o le mu ere naa.
Most people have a problem with that.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni iṣoro pẹlu iṣoro naa.
You can’t miss that face anymore either.	O ko le padanu oju iyẹn mọ boya.
Live with them.	Gbe pẹlu wọn.
Take it.	A mu wa.
I wonder if this book will work for me.	Mo Iyanu boya iwe yii yoo ṣiṣẹ fun mi.
Which is not becoming clear.	Eyi ti o jẹ ko di ko o.
This is not what you expect.	Eyi kii ṣe ohun ti o nireti.
I want to make sure.	Mo fẹ lati rii daju.
Everyone has heard of cars that can park on their own.	Gbogbo eniyan ti gbọ nipa awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o le duro si ara wọn.
Play, but get enough rest.	Mu ṣiṣẹ, ṣugbọn gba isinmi to.
They know me well.	Wọn mọ mi daradara.
He looked at the clock.	O wo aago naa.
That is the man.	Ọkunrin yẹn ni.
I would like to give good advice.	Mo nifẹ lati fun imọran to dara.
Everything here is just amazing.	Ohun gbogbo nibi jẹ iyalẹnu nikan.
They are female.	Wọn jẹ obinrin.
We need water for life.	A nilo omi fun igbesi aye.
Eat more of this, don’t be that.	Je diẹ sii ninu eyi, maṣe jẹ iyẹn.
I will never be hungry again.	Ebi ko ni je mi je mo.
No more words needed.	Awọn ọrọ diẹ sii ko nilo.
This device has failed.	Ẹrọ yii ti kọ silẹ.
Life will be very difficult.	Igbesi aye yoo nira pupọ.
We hope the weather will be sunny and warm.	A nireti pe oju ojo yoo wa ni oorun ati ki o gbona.
It has always been a family.	O ti nigbagbogbo ti a ebi.
He left us because our questions were on his mind.	O fi wa silẹ nitori awọn ibeere wa lori ọkan rẹ.
We had .	Ati .
Bring the back of your head to the front of your head.	Mu ẹhin ori rẹ lọ si iwaju ori rẹ.
He asked me if he had passed his test.	O beere lọwọ mi pe o ti kọja idanwo rẹ.
Do you live in this city or what?	Ṣe o ngbe ni ilu yi tabi kini.
All they have to do is die for it.	Ohun gbogbo ti wọn ṣe ni lati ku fun.
Not him.	Kii ṣe oun.
Maybe some good and some bad.	Boya diẹ ninu awọn ti o dara ati diẹ ninu awọn buburu.
This is a very old house.	Eleyi jẹ gidigidi atijọ ile.
I have never seen him before.	Emi ko tii ri i tẹlẹ.
This energy is within us.	Agbara yii wa ninu wa.
If you're angry, you're not.	Ti o ba binu, iwọ ko.
Know that you must.	Mọ pe o gbọdọ.
It did a little better.	O ṣe diẹ ti o dara.
You have to say something.	O ni lati sọ nkankan.
We are there to work on ourselves.	A wa nibẹ lati ṣiṣẹ lori ara wa.
I thought about that for a minute.	Mo ronu nipa iyẹn fun iṣẹju kan.
I have to admit, he said to himself.	Mo ni lati gba, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
How many meals do you need?	Awọn ounjẹ melo ni o nilo?
Here were beautiful things.	Nibi wà lẹwa ohun.
Every student has to wear a school uniform.	Gbogbo ọmọ ile-iwe ni lati wọ aṣọ ile-iwe.
Opportunity must be available for them to play.	Anfani gbọdọ wa ni wa fun wọn lati mu.
It ought to be below.	O yẹ lati wa ni isalẹ.
I don’t even remember it.	Emi ko paapaa ranti rẹ.
It’s about kids, girls.	O jẹ nipa awọn ọmọde, awọn ọmọbirin.
The whole family was amazed.	Ẹnu ya gbogbo idile naa.
Neither do you.	Bẹni o fẹ.
We just can not seem to stop people!	A o kan ko le dabi lati da awon eniyan!
He paid the bill and hurried out of the restaurant.	O san owo naa o si yara jade kuro ni ile ounjẹ naa.
We thought it was coming up behind, but it came up before.	A ro pe o n bọ soke lẹhin, ṣugbọn o wa soke ṣaaju ki o to.
At least you know where you are.	O kere o mọ ibi ti o wa.
Just sleep.	O kan sun.
This is a new day.	Eyi jẹ ọjọ tuntun.
The school has gone through a book for the student.	Ile-iwe naa ti lọ nipasẹ iwe fun ọmọ ile-iwe naa.
If you want.	Ti o ba fẹ.
I do not.	Emi ko ṣe.
He stopped, slightly forward, and looked.	O duro, diẹ si iwaju, o si wo.
It’s a lot more than that.	O jẹ pupọ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
Maybe it’s something else completely.	Boya o jẹ nkan miiran patapata.
You don’t see how it can be done.	O ko rii bi o ṣe le ṣee ṣe rẹ.
You can't go out on your own, you can't.	O ko le jade ti ara rẹ, o ko le.
Many young people may think so.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọdọ le ro ero rẹ.
She wanted to talk to her mother.	O fẹ ki o ba iya rẹ sọrọ.
We know this game.	A mọ ere yii.
You need to take this position.	O nilo lati mu ipo yii.
It is something we need more than anything.	O jẹ ohun ti a nilo diẹ sii ju ohunkohun lọ.
If they do.	Ti wọn ba ṣe niyẹn.
You know the way.	O mọ ọna naa.
You can try it.	O le gbiyanju o.
I'm sure you agree.	Mo da mi loju pe o gba.
But some do not accept what others say.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu awọn miiran ko gba ohun ti awọn miiran n sọ.
These new items are likely to sell well.	Awọn nkan tuntun wọnyi ṣee ṣe lati ta daradara.
You always know what to say.	O nigbagbogbo mọ kini lati sọ.
You have not seen or heard of him since.	O ko tii ri tabi gbọ nipa rẹ lati igba naa.
Do not listen.	Maṣe gbọ.
And we don’t like people who take advantage of us.	Ati pe a ko fẹran eniyan ti o lo anfani wa.
Neither of them stopped.	Bẹni ninu wọn ko duro.
We will stay with your parents for a while.	A yoo duro pẹlu awọn obi rẹ fun igba diẹ.
They think this is the best interest of their child.	Wọn ro pe eyi ni anfani ti o dara julọ ti ọmọ wọn.
Or there used to be.	Tabi nibẹ lo lati wa ni.
That was a good night.	Alẹ ti o dara niyẹn.
Let me repeat the question.	Jẹ ki n tun ibeere naa ṣe.
We have to get rid of them.	A ni lati lọwọ wọn.
Read.	Ka awọn.
This is not the time to feel anything.	Eyi kii ṣe akoko lati lero ohunkohun.
The first time he'd ever seen her caught.	Ni igba akọkọ ti o fẹ lailai ri i mu.
I like the water.	Mo feran omi naa.
Come down here.	Wa si isalẹ nibi.
The first thing to remember is that you must listen.	Ohun akọkọ lati ranti ni pe o gbọdọ gbọ.
That is what love does.	Ohun ti ifẹ ṣe niyẹn.
You have to see a doctor.	O ni lati ri dokita kan.
But one thing is for sure.	Ṣugbọn ohun kan daju.
You need your skills now.	O nilo awọn ọgbọn rẹ ni bayi.
I will have to lock.	Emi yoo ni lati tii.
I was young for that.	Mo jẹ ọdọ fun iyẹn.
He has a story for you.	O ni itan kan fun ọ.
I would never say anything like that.	Emi yoo ko sọ nkankan bi wipe.
I read it and loved it.	Mo ti ka o ati ki o feran o.
Only those who are educated can have such jobs.	Awọn ti o kọ ẹkọ nikan le ni iru awọn iṣẹ bẹ.
The minute it happens, you are right.	Ni iṣẹju ti o ṣẹlẹ, o tọ.
He also lives nearby.	O tun ngbe nitosi.
We can do better.	A le ṣe dara julọ.
The fact that he was going to die was given.	Otitọ pe oun yoo ku ni a fun ni.
It's too fast.	O yara ju.
We will miss the rain.	A yoo padanu ojo.
Move to cash when you can not find anything to buy and wait.	Gbe lọ si owo nigba ti o ko ba le ri ohunkohun lati ra ati ki o duro.
Taken off.	Ti fa kuro.
I returned home.	Mo pada si ile.
I want to go to you.	Mo fẹ lọ si ọdọ rẹ.
Just the details.	O kan awọn alaye.
We will not miss your time.	A ko ni padanu akoko rẹ.
No one did much in the first few days.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe pupọ ni awọn ọjọ diẹ akọkọ.
I am very happy to see you.	Inu mi dun pupọ lati ri ọ.
They are still there, but few people see them.	Wọn tun wa, ṣugbọn diẹ eniyan ni o rii wọn.
And he will never forget.	Ati pe ko ni gbagbe.
It could be wrong.	O le jẹ aṣiṣe.
They get outside.	Wọn gba ita.
Sure, it will take some hard work.	Daju, yoo gba diẹ ninu iṣẹ lile.
Now there is no.	Bayi ko si eyikeyi.
Give him our position.	Fun u ni ipo wa.
We cannot know how much you have been told.	A ko le mọ iye ti o ti sọ fun ọ.
You just can't.	O kan ko le.
We cannot ask you.	A ko le beere lọwọ rẹ.
I can't see your face.	Nko le ri oju re.
And in the end you get what you want.	Ati ni ipari o gba ohun ti o fẹ.
This restaurant is still operating today.	Ile ounjẹ yii tun n ṣiṣẹ loni.
Others stopped to look at me too.	Awọn miiran duro lati wo mi paapaa.
They will talk to you about it.	Wọn yoo ba ọ sọrọ nipa rẹ.
You know that.	O mọ iyẹn.
When a new person arrives our new community begins.	Nigbati eniyan tuntun ba de agbegbe tuntun wa ti o bẹrẹ.
Of course there are others who feel like you do.	Dajudaju awọn miiran wa ti o lero bi iwọ ṣe.
He laughed at the little girl.	O rẹrin si ọmọbirin kekere naa.
I tried to open one as much as possible.	Mo ti gbiyanju lati ṣii ọkan bi o ti ṣee.
That’s the situation here.	Iyẹn ni ipo nibi.
Come with me now.	Wa pẹlu mi ni bayi.
When we get them back, we will break them intelligently.	Nigba ti a ba gba wọn pada, a yoo fọ wọn ni oye.
Live with your father.	Gbe pẹlu baba rẹ.
I would be very happy for any help.	Emi yoo dun pupọ fun iranlọwọ eyikeyi.
It is good news.	O jẹ iroyin ti o dara.
No one asked for anything.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o beere ohunkohun.
I had to be first.	Mo ni lati jẹ akọkọ.
Maybe it’s a meal.	Boya o jẹ ounjẹ kan.
Now you must work and take care of your children.	Bayi o gbọdọ ṣiṣẹ ati tọju awọn ọmọ rẹ.
That is a big question.	Ibeere nla ni.
No one has the space to say anything.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ni aye lati sọ ohunkohun.
Please return these comments to your students.	Jọwọ, da awọn ọrọ wọnyi pada si awọn ọmọ ile-iwe rẹ.
You don’t want me to have anything of my own.	O ko fẹ mi lati ni ohunkohun ti ara mi.
That is the story, father.	Itan naa niyen, baba.
It is not possible to find someone to talk to.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati wa ẹnikan lati sọrọ.
Sometimes very little.	Nigba miiran o kere pupọ.
He even asked her.	O ti beere rẹ paapaa.
Any two people.	Eyikeyi eniyan meji.
I can't seem to swim.	Emi ko le dabi lati we.
And as soon as the world knows, as soon as the city knows, they will arrest him.	Ati ni kete ti aye mọ, ni kete ti ilu mọ, wọn yoo mu u.
I know how hard you have tried.	Mo ti mọ bi o lile ti o ti gbiyanju.
However it did not happen to him to call a doctor.	Sibẹsibẹ ko ṣẹlẹ si rẹ lati pe dokita kan.
There is no place to go outside again.	Ko si aaye lati lọ si ita lẹẹkansi.
Maybe it will reach the eyes of people who need it.	Boya o yoo de oju awọn eniyan ti o nilo rẹ.
They have no idea the way they want to be.	Wọn ko ni imọran ọna ti wọn fẹ lati jẹ.
They have held another meeting.	Wọn ti gbe ipade miiran.
It is past time for many things.	O ti kọja akoko fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun.
He loved the team.	O fẹ ẹgbẹ naa.
You may not know, but it is yours.	O le ma mọ, ṣugbọn o jẹ tirẹ.
I know you are right.	Mo mọ pe o tọ.
It was her again.	O je rẹ lẹẹkansi.
This is an obvious mistake.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe ti o han gbangba.
Without them, this would not have happened.	Laisi wọn, eyi kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Turn your head to one side.	Yi ori rẹ si ẹgbẹ kan.
Such images are usually seen in public images.	Iru awọn aworan ni a maa n rii ni awọn aworan gbangba.
But he has friends.	Ṣugbọn o ni awọn ọrẹ.
It can make it work.	O le jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
Can't talk to me.	Ko le ba mi sọrọ.
The location of the school is convenient for most students.	Ipo ti ile-iwe jẹ rọrun fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe.
Ask about them.	Beere nipa wọn.
With your child, even if you are young.	Pẹlu ọmọ rẹ, paapaa ti o ba jẹ ọdọ.
And so fun so beautiful.	Ati bẹ fun ki lẹwa.
I am not the person we want.	Emi kii ṣe eniyan ti a fẹ.
In the rainy winter, we decided to change something.	Ni igba otutu ti ojo, a pinnu lati yi nkan pada.
They killed my birth sister a few months ago.	Awọn ni wọn pa arabinrin mi ti ibi ni oṣu diẹ sẹhin.
I love what you do.	Mo nifẹ ohun ti o ṣe.
I would not want these problems on anyone.	Emi kii yoo fẹ awọn iṣoro wọnyi lori ẹnikẹni.
The best way to stop it is to remember it.	Ọna ti o dara julọ lati da a duro ni lati ranti rẹ.
At least, some of us are.	O kere ju, diẹ ninu wa jẹ.
And there is nothing wrong with that.	Ati pe ko si ohun ti ko tọ si pẹlu awọn yẹn.
My phone does not stop ringing.	Foonu mi ko da ohun orin duro.
I bought anything sweet.	Mo ra ohunkohun ti o dun.
In the end.	Ni ipari.
It was warm in the room.	O gbona ninu yara naa.
Now you can get anything.	Bayi o le gba ohunkohun.
I wish you were here.	Mo fẹ pe o wa nibi.
That’s where you want to be.	Iyẹn ni ibi ti o fẹ lati wa.
The sister is not well.	Arabinrin naa ko dara.
The heat is intense.	Ooru ni agbara.
It does not matter.	Ko ṣe akiyesi.
We must have girls in school.	A gbọdọ ni awọn ọmọbirin ni ile-iwe.
He knew his father was waiting for him.	O mọ pe baba rẹ n duro de oun.
You must	O gbọdọ
Just something they have to do.	O kan nkankan ti won ni lati se.
I think most people can.	Mo ro pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan le.
But these reports cannot be ignored.	Ṣugbọn awọn iroyin yii ko le ṣe akiyesi.
So very true.	Nitorina otitọ pupọ.
I have to go for it.	Mo ni lati lọ fun o.
At least we are on earth.	O kere ti a ba wa lori ile aye.
He did not use it.	Ko lo o.
How much power there is in your feet.	Elo ni agbara wa ninu awọn ẹsẹ rẹ.
They are in my house with my wife and daughter.	Wọn wa ni ile mi pẹlu iyawo mi ati ọmọbirin mi.
I do not have to drive.	Emi ko ni lati wakọ.
They will ask you a few questions.	Wọn yoo beere lọwọ rẹ awọn ibeere diẹ.
This is my son's name and my personal life.	Eyi ni orukọ ọmọ mi ati igbesi aye ara ẹni mi.
It was like nothing you had ever heard.	O dabi ohunkohun ti o ti gbọ lailai.
It was too late for the meeting.	O pẹ pupọ si ipade naa.
Can't just get out right now.	Ko le kan jade ni bayi.
I really want it to be.	Mo fe ki o le gan.
Something that can change everything.	Nkankan ti o le yi ohun gbogbo pada.
Here is one.	Eyi ni ọkan.
Let me say it my way.	Jẹ ki n sọ ọ ni ọna mi.
He made such a beautiful picture.	O ṣe iru aworan to dara bẹ.
A child cannot learn to run before they learn to walk.	Ọmọde ko le kọ ẹkọ lati sare ṣaaju ki wọn ti kọ ẹkọ lati rin.
New ones are always coming out.	Awọn tuntun nigbagbogbo n jade.
But wait, you have to tell me your name first.	Ṣugbọn duro, o ni lati sọ orukọ rẹ fun mi ni akọkọ.
I made a lot of mistakes.	Mo ṣe aṣiṣe pupọ.
With children.	Pẹlu awọn ọmọ.
Rain came when we expected them.	Ojo ti de nigba ti a reti wọn.
It looks like water.	Omi lo n wo.
I think he came to talk to me.	Mo ro pe o wa lati ba mi sọrọ.
There is truth to this.	Otitọ wa si eyi.
He wants to return here every year.	O fẹ lati pada si ibi ni gbogbo ọdun.
But a lot of fun.	Sugbon a pupo ti fun.
This is not just about money and benefits.	Eyi kii ṣe nipa owo ati awọn anfani nikan.
He could not continue with his work.	Ko le tẹsiwaju pẹlu iṣẹ rẹ.
As the years went by, he continued to work.	Bi awọn ọdun ti kọja, o tẹsiwaju lati ṣiṣẹ.
He would have loved more of a career, he said.	Yoo ti nifẹ diẹ sii ti iṣẹ kan, o sọ.
She lets her children wait for the sun to rise.	O ba awọn ọmọ rẹ jẹ ki o duro de oorun lati yọ.
That is bad news.	Iyẹn ni iroyin buburu.
The picture is very beautiful.	Aworan naa lẹwa pupọ.
I let you die in the best possible way.	Mo jẹ ki o ku ni ọna ti o dara julọ.
Good for me.	O dara fun mi.
And we are still high up.	Ati pe a tun wa ga soke.
The trees and shrubs around the house.	Awọn igi ati awọn igi ti o wa ni ayika ile naa.
They watched the game for an hour.	Wọn wo ere naa fun wakati kan.
I want to at least try.	Mo fẹ lati ni o kere gbiyanju.
We would have had the opportunity to leave.	A yoo ti ni aye lati lọ kuro.
I need water.	Mo nilo omi.
Those should help.	Awon yẹ ki o ran.
There are a few problems with the phone.	Awọn iṣoro diẹ wa pẹlu foonu naa.
I think you are on to something here.	Mo ro pe o wa lori nkankan nibi.
No one down there.	Ko si eniyan ni isalẹ wa nibẹ.
He will explain what is happening.	Oun yoo ṣe alaye ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
I can't get it out of my head.	Emi ko le gba ọ kuro ni ori mi.
We do not need to know.	A ko nilo lati mọ.
It was bad all good.	O je buburu gbogbo dara.
I just have to ask.	Mo kan ni lati beere.
I know everything about it.	Mo mọ ohun gbogbo nipa rẹ.
You love that machine.	O nifẹ ẹrọ yẹn.
Say what you need to say.	Sọ ohun ti o nilo lati sọ.
Everyone played both ways.	Gbogbo eniyan dun awọn ọna mejeeji.
Temporary.	Fun igba diẹ.
Could not have been there.	Ko le ti wa nibẹ.
And people are angry about that.	Ati awọn eniyan binu nipa eyi.
Possibly, maybe more.	O ṣee ṣe, boya diẹ sii.
Almost a month ago, now.	O fẹrẹ to oṣu kan sẹhin, ni bayi.
I would say the same thing.	Emi yoo sọ ohun kanna.
Now, go enjoy and express your heart !.	Bayi, lọ gbadun ki o sọ ọkan rẹ!.
Let me tell you about it.	Jẹ ki n sọ fun ọ nipa rẹ.
He left it on the table.	O fi silẹ lori tabili.
You need some rest time.	O nilo akoko isinmi diẹ.
Homes are there.	Awọn ile wa nibẹ.
Maybe they can stop.	Boya wọn le da duro.
Only through many years.	Nikan nipasẹ ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
Both sides are on board with him.	Awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji wa lori ọkọ pẹlu rẹ.
You want to change clothes.	O fẹ yi aṣọ pada.
I do not know what it is.	Emi ko mọ kini o jẹ.
Like, out of everything.	Bi, kuro ninu ohun gbogbo.
I can see that happening.	Mo le rii pe n ṣẹlẹ.
They are friends with my sister.	Wọn jẹ ọrẹ pẹlu arabinrin mi.
It will be removed.	O yoo wa ni kuro.
I think he got it from his father.	Mo ro pe o gba lati ọdọ baba rẹ.
I read about what is happening here.	Mo ka nipa ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ nibi.
Ability to get out there to help.	Agbara lati jade nibẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
Don't tell my husband!	Maṣe sọ fun ọkọ mi!
Do they know what you are talking about?	Ṣe wọn mọ ohun ti o n sọrọ nipa?
Off was off of it.	Pa wà pa ti o.
He will keep information from the boy's father.	Oun yoo tọju alaye lati ọdọ baba ọmọkunrin naa.
You don’t want it to look like that.	O ko fẹ ki o dabi bẹ.
I asked for help.	Mo beere fun iranlọwọ.
It doesn’t happen overnight and it’s not easy.	Ko ṣẹlẹ ni ọjọ kan ati pe ko rọrun.
Fortunately, he did not know what to do.	O da, ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
I like it and don’t take it.	Mo fẹ rẹ ati ki o ko mu rẹ.
Everything comes with a purpose.	Ohun gbogbo wa pẹlu idi kan.
Okay, at least for me.	O dara, o kere ju fun mi.
And bad luck.	Ati ipalara buburu.
He is on fire with her.	O wa lori ina pẹlu rẹ.
It doesn't matter.	Ko ṣe pataki.
They bought a car a few years ago.	Wọn ra ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan ni ọdun diẹ sẹhin.
He came back upstairs.	O wa pada si oke.
Can't get away with this.	Ko le gba kuro pẹlu eyi.
Obviously not their job.	O han ni kii ṣe iṣẹ wọn.
You agree to have lunch with him.	O gba lati jẹ ounjẹ ọsan pẹlu rẹ.
I have to work on that really.	Mo ni lati ṣiṣẹ lori iyẹn gaan.
He did not finish school this year.	O ko pari ile-iwe ni ọdun yii.
I want to go out.	Mo fẹ jade.
These two things were really one, after all.	Awọn meji ohun wà gan ọkan, lẹhin ti gbogbo.
I don’t remember anyone doing anything great.	Emi ko ranti ẹnikẹni ti o ṣe ohunkohun nla.
The story is there.	Itan naa wa nibẹ.
I stopped the car.	Mo duro ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
Very interesting and well done picture.	Aworan ti o nifẹ pupọ ati ti o ṣe daradara.
Is there anything you can do about that?	Njẹ ohunkohun ti o le ṣe nipa iyẹn?
You can do it and you will do it.	O le ṣe ati pe iwọ yoo ṣe.
We will continue with the project.	A yoo tẹsiwaju pẹlu iṣẹ naa.
It should be good.	O yẹ ki o dara.
They are watching you.	Won n wo o.
And he used force.	Ati pe o lo agbara.
You never know how it will turn out.	O ko mọ bi o ṣe ṣẹlẹ.
Whatever it is.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ.
There are such cases.	Nibẹ ni o wa iru igba.
He obviously likes it.	O han gbangba pe o fẹran rẹ.
He could not come to the meeting.	Ko le wa si ipade.
I don't know where to go.	Emi ko mọ ibiti o ti le lọ.
That is not entirely true, but it will suffice.	Iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ patapata, ṣugbọn yoo ti to.
Don't think, just do.	Maṣe ronu, kan ṣe.
It doesn’t stop me amazing.	Ko da mi duro iyanu.
Please help me with this.	Jọwọ ran mi lọwọ pẹlu eyi.
But remember, we do not have much time.	Ṣugbọn ranti, a ko ni akoko pupọ.
And prices are rising.	Ati awọn iye owo n dagba sii.
I say them again.	Mo tun sọ wọn lẹẹkansi.
It's too small.	O ti kere ju.
Walk around these trees.	Rin ni ayika awọn igi wọnyi.
Maybe they will.	Boya wọn yoo ṣe.
I can not stand this.	Emi ko le duro yi.
Her only head was in the room.	Ori rẹ nikan wa ninu yara naa.
For one thing, he did not just look inside.	Fun ohun kan, ko wo inu nikan.
Just to let it begin.	O kan lati jẹ ki o bẹrẹ.
Or on it.	Tabi lori rẹ.
This mountain is the highest around the place.	Oke yii ni o ga julọ ni ayika ibi.
You have a lot of questions.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere.
My father could not know.	Baba mi ko le mọ.
I miss you.	Mo padanu rẹ.
That is what man is.	Ohun ti eniyan je niyen.
However, that is unlikely to happen.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn ko ṣeeṣe lati ṣẹlẹ.
Will you get married?	Ṣe iwọ yoo ṣe igbeyawo?
Is this the best of course?	Ṣe eyi ti o dara ju dajudaju?
But it can not.	Sugbon ko le.
It will raise an error if not.	Yoo gbe aṣiṣe dide ti kii ba ṣe bẹ.
He considered his work to be an important one.	O ka iṣẹ rẹ si iṣẹ pataki kan.
At least, not for him.	O kere ju, kii ṣe fun u.
They will help him.	Wọn yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
He is accepted by his work.	O ti gba nipasẹ iṣẹ rẹ.
They want something.	Wọn fẹ nkankan.
On his way, boy.	Lori ọna rẹ, ọmọkunrin.
In fact, no one believed it was even possible.	Ni otitọ, ko si ẹnikan ti o gbagbọ pe o ṣee ṣe paapaa.
We must do it now.	A gbọdọ ṣe ni bayi.
She has not changed and she does not have a sister.	Ko ti yipada ati pe ko ni arabinrin rẹ.
I talked to him on the phone.	Mo ba a sọrọ lori foonu.
It has value.	O ni iye.
This is hard to explain.	Eleyi jẹ gidigidi lati se alaye.
But they continue.	Ṣugbọn wọn tẹsiwaju.
I may be one of you, he said.	Mo le jẹ ọkan ninu yin, o sọ.
At first he could not believe his mother.	Ni akọkọ o ko le gbagbọ iya rẹ.
Some new ones, too.	Diẹ ninu awọn tuntun, paapaa.
This is your last life to do something of your life.	Eyi ni aye ikẹhin rẹ lati ṣe nkan ti igbesi aye rẹ.
The ship was made of iron.	Irin ni a fi ṣe ọkọ oju omi naa.
I think all fathers do.	Mo ro pe gbogbo awọn baba ṣe bẹ.
No, now everyone is going.	Rara, ni bayi gbogbo eniyan lo.
It was a short time.	O jẹ akoko kekere.
I told my mother that no one was right.	Mo sọ fun iya mi pe ko si ọkan ti o jẹ otitọ.
This does not exist, and perhaps will not.	Eyi ko si tẹlẹ, ati boya kii yoo ṣe.
There is no way to get an education at all.	Ko si ọna lati gba ẹkọ rara.
It takes a while.	O gba igba diẹ.
However, their image serves other purposes.	Sibẹsibẹ, aworan wọn ṣe awọn idi miiran.
None of us did.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa ti o ṣe.
We will work all that out when it gets better.	A yoo ṣiṣẹ gbogbo iyẹn nigbati o ba dara julọ.
But we do not have to be that person.	Ṣugbọn a ko ni lati jẹ eniyan yẹn.
I know that well.	Mo mọ pe daradara.
It does nothing to find out.	Ko ṣe ohunkohun lati wa jade.
Only time will tell whether the trees will grow back.	Akoko nikan yoo sọ boya awọn igi yoo dagba pada.
So this is the thing.	Nitorina eyi ni nkan naa.
You can not pay me more.	O ko le san mi diẹ sii.
This does not mean that nothing is happening.	Eyi ko tumọ si pe ko si nkan ti n ṣẹlẹ.
They belong to a similar group.	Wọn jẹ ti iru kan.
Men are not fast.	Awọn ọkunrin ko sare.
When you are right, be right.	Nigbati o ba tọ, jẹ ki o tọ.
He wanted to go, but could not.	O fẹ lati lọ, ṣugbọn ko le.
You want to see your friend.	O fẹ ri ọrẹ rẹ.
This is the rest of the decision in your career.	Eyi ni isinmi ipinnu ninu iṣẹ rẹ.
It is very understandable.	O jẹ oye pupọ.
I think it will change the tone.	Mo ro pe yoo yi ohun orin pada.
Always at the same time.	Nigbagbogbo ni akoko kanna.
You mean.	O tumọ si.
We would have talked about the game.	A yoo ti sọrọ nipa ere naa.
I have to remember who did this to him, especially.	Mo ni lati ranti ẹniti o ṣe eyi si i, paapaa.
You can say.	O le sọ.
Maybe they get it.	Boya wọn gba.
A letter has been sent to you.	A ti fi lẹta ranṣẹ si ọ.
I can't find me.	Nko le ri mi.
Has not completed any.	Ti ko pari eyikeyi.
I just work.	Mo kan ṣiṣẹ.
Children grow up.	Awọn ọmọde dagba.
You want to hear more of them, much more.	O fẹ lati gbọ diẹ sii ti wọn, pupọ diẹ sii.
I will promise them.	Emi yoo ṣe ileri wọn.
Again you have made a mistake.	Lẹẹkansi o ti ṣe aṣiṣe.
I have heard my mother tell the story many times.	Mo ti gbọ iya mi sọ itan naa ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
In my opinion there are no better friends you can have.	Ni ero mi ko si awọn ọrẹ to dara julọ ti o le ni.
Nothing was ever good enough.	Ko si ohun ti o wà lailai dara to.
They have no children.	Wọn ko ni ọmọ.
But he could not get over it.	Ṣugbọn ko le kọja si ọdọ rẹ.
Two men, two little girls.	Awọn ọkunrin meji, awọn ọmọbirin kekere meji.
They came to help.	Wọn de ọdọ lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
That sounds like a mistake.	Iyẹn dabi aṣiṣe.
I need to get some bread.	Mo nilo lati gba akara diẹ.
I have some money.	Mo ni diẹ ninu owo.
Let it do its job.	Jẹ ki o ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
You must do this before leaving the area.	O gbọdọ ṣe eyi ṣaaju ki o to lọ kuro ni agbegbe naa.
I do not want children at all.	Emi ko fẹ awọn ọmọde rara.
There was no human opinion for him at the time.	Ko si ero eniyan fun u ni akoko yẹn.
No such person.	Ko si iru eniyan.
This is easier than it sounds.	Eyi rọrun ju bi o ti n dun lọ.
He held his mouth.	O di ẹnu rẹ mu.
It does not take up space in the building.	Ko gba aaye ninu ile naa.
It was interesting, very so.	O je awon, gidigidi ki.
They can notice them.	Wọn le ṣe akiyesi wọn.
This is personal.	Eyi jẹ ti ara ẹni.
Your mother will need it.	Iya rẹ yoo nilo rẹ.
I never wanted to give up my job.	Emi ko fẹ silẹ ninu iṣẹ mi rara.
I hate everything about this.	Mo korira ohun gbogbo nipa eyi.
I have to close my eyes.	Mo ni lati pa oju mi.
It has never made sense.	O ti ko ṣe ori.
Don't worry about it.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan nipa rẹ.
And remember whatever you do your children will do again.	Ati ki o ranti ohunkohun ti o ṣe awọn ọmọ rẹ yoo tun ṣe.
You may not be able to do it yourself.	O le ma ni anfani lati ṣe funrararẹ.
You want to talk to me, you do not appear here.	O fẹ lati ba mi sọrọ, iwọ ko han nibi.
I do not want your money.	Nko fe owo re.
And there is nothing you can do about it.	Ati pe ko si ohun ti o le ṣe nipa rẹ.
I am here for the baby.	Mo wa nibi fun ọmọ naa.
By the time, too.	Nipa akoko, paapaa.
Many times.	Ọpọlọpọ igba.
I ate there at least so much.	Mo ti jẹun nibẹ ni o kere ju bẹẹ lọ.
Not for nothing.	Ko fun ohunkohun.
Reason told me not to be afraid.	Idi so fun mi ko bẹru.
If you want to do that, fine.	Ti o ba fẹ ṣe iyẹn, o dara.
He raised his voice.	O gbe ohun rẹ soke.
It's time to act.	O ni akoko lati ṣe.
Please help me to see what the problem is if you can.	Jọwọ ran mi lọwọ lati wo kini iṣoro naa ti o ba le.
That was a great feeling.	Iyẹn jẹ rilara nla.
That is not your way.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ọna rẹ.
This is my decision.	Eyi ni ipinnu mi.
I was late to it, but found it very helpful.	Mo ti pẹ si o, ṣugbọn ri pe o ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
He could not let that happen again.	Ko le jẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
They get new positions in this office.	Wọn gba awọn ipo tuntun ni ọfiisi yii.
He was alone at home with her.	O wa nikan ni ile pẹlu rẹ.
I have seen this boy around before.	Mo ti rii ọmọkunrin yii ni ayika tẹlẹ.
I would like the same thing.	Emi yoo fẹ ohun kanna.
Some citizens were outraged by this suggestion.	Diẹ ninu awọn ara ilu binu nipasẹ imọran yii.
You can help me more.	O le ran mi lọwọ diẹ sii.
No way.	Ko ṣee ṣe.
They had three children.	Wọn bi ọmọ mẹta.
It was so much more than running for me.	O jẹ pupọ diẹ sii ju ṣiṣe fun mi lọ.
There are several areas to consider.	Awọn aaye pupọ lo wa lati ṣe akiyesi.
But we need to keep our eyes on the gift.	Ṣugbọn a nilo lati tọju oju wa lori ẹbun naa.
Let them agree with you.	Jẹ ki a jẹ ki wọn gba pẹlu rẹ.
They just lost our job.	Wọn kan padanu iṣẹ wa.
They think they can make our lives better for us.	Wọn ro pe wọn le ṣe igbesi aye wa fun wa.
Must be a long time.	Gbọdọ wa ni igba pipẹ.
It's just wrong.	O kan ni aṣiṣe.
You also have to return to value settings.	O tun ni lati pada si awọn eto iye.
They have to wear old clothes.	Wọn ni lati wọ aṣọ atijọ.
You should have heard.	O yẹ ki o ti gbọ.
It was not a hard sell.	O je ko kan lile ta.
You make me sick.	O da inu bi mi.
Just get through it.	O kan gba nipasẹ rẹ.
Okay, you can just leave.	O dara, o le kan lọ kuro.
Your mother.	Iya re.
For this purpose we use.	Fun idi eyi a lo.
It was something to see.	O jẹ nkan lati rii.
He accepted the book.	O gba iwe naa.
But they beat me.	Sugbon won maa n lu mi.
He did not eat.	O ko jẹun.
But the problem is, people are on the way.	Ṣugbọn iṣoro naa ni, awọn eniyan wa ni ọna.
There are always a lot of boat accidents.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ijamba ọkọ oju omi nigbagbogbo wa.
But she does not even seem to be happy about it.	Ṣugbọn o ko paapaa dabi pe inu rẹ dun nipa rẹ.
I know who this is.	Mo mọ ẹni ti eyi jẹ.
It was a good game !.	O jẹ ere ti o dara!.
He made a lot of money during his lifetime.	O ni owo nla nigba aye re.
And the lights went out.	Ati awọn ina pa lọ.
We found it at the party	A ri i ni ibi ayẹyẹ naa
It is the best in the whole area.	O dara julọ ni gbogbo agbegbe.
No mistakes, it just did not happen.	Ko si awọn aṣiṣe, o kan ko ṣẹlẹ.
Pictures to find.	Awọn aworan lati wa.
She now understands that her father will not accept their marriage at all.	O loye ni bayi pe baba rẹ ko ni gba si igbeyawo wọn rara.
Didn't find anything.	Ko ri nkankan.
At first, no one believed.	Ni akọkọ, ko si ẹnikan ti o gbagbọ.
We hope for the best.	A nireti fun ohun ti o dara julọ.
You can hide your face but we know it.	O le tọju oju rẹ ṣugbọn a mọ ọ.
I just see you as your own.	Mo kan rii ọ bi ara rẹ.
He brought it to you physically.	O si mu si o nipa ti ara.
I made a point to not look at it.	Mo ṣe aaye kan lati ma wo rẹ.
Stay away from this, you.	Duro kuro ninu eyi, iwọ.
Now we are getting some truth.	Bayi a n gba diẹ ninu otitọ.
Winter has arrived.	Igba otutu ti de.
I will cut after my mother.	Emi yoo ge lẹhin iya mi.
But you can not just decide to become a teacher.	Ṣugbọn o ko le pinnu nikan lati di olukọ.
But note some other less obvious things.	Ṣugbọn ṣe akiyesi awọn ohun miiran ti ko han gbangba diẹ.
And, we are looking at another long day today.	Ati pe, a n wo ọjọ pipẹ miiran loni.
They could not find one.	Wọn ko le ri ọkan.
Everything is still there for that moment.	Ohun gbogbo tun wa fun akoko yẹn.
They live, he thought.	Wọn n gbe, o ro.
No one knows anything.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ nkankan.
And often, they will not.	Ati nigbagbogbo, wọn kii yoo.
But the truth is his rules.	Ṣugbọn otitọ ni awọn ofin tirẹ.
This is the book that will open your mind and heart.	Eyi ni iwe ti yoo ṣii ọkan ati ọkan rẹ.
We need you to continue working.	A nilo ki o tẹsiwaju ṣiṣẹ.
I want you to do it.	Mo fẹ ki o ṣe.
That is all true.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo otitọ.
Maybe even today.	Boya paapaa loni.
This cannot continue.	Eyi ko le tẹsiwaju.
He speaks like you, too.	O sọrọ bii rẹ, paapaa.
Since then some have changed.	Lati igba naa diẹ ti yipada.
You are not really scared.	Iwọ ko bẹru gaan.
That can really give me.	Iyẹn le fun mi gaan.
I can not find anything.	Nko le ri nkankan.
And we cannot be harmed.	Ati pe a ko le fun ni ipalara.
And so on.	Ati bẹ naa.
In this room.	Ninu yara yi.
The game must have been almost over.	Ere naa gbọdọ ti fẹrẹ pari.
You have to give me something.	O ni lati fun mi ni nkankan.
Most people live there.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan n gbe nibẹ.
But we do not have it here or any of the others.	Ṣugbọn a ko ni i nibi tabi eyikeyi ninu awọn miiran.
I bought my parents a house.	Mo ti ra awon obi mi ile kan.
I took your money.	Mo gba owo re.
In his family, he was the child.	Ninu idile rẹ, o jẹ ọmọ naa.
This has never happened before.	Eyi ko ri tẹlẹ.
Can't wait until we get out.	Ko le duro titi a o fi jade.
I got fired from that job.	Mo gba mi kuro ni iṣẹ yẹn.
They cannot put themselves in the other person's eyes.	Wọn ko le fi ara wọn si oju ti eniyan miiran.
But that cannot be.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko le jẹ.
That was another man completely.	Iyẹn jẹ ọkunrin miiran patapata.
This is amazing.	Eyi jẹ iyalẹnu.
Something else is not understood.	Ohun kan miiran ko loye.
Not really sure that did in the game.	Ko daju daju pe iyẹn ṣe ninu ere naa.
There are few who doubt its truth.	Diẹ ni o wa ti wọn ṣiyemeji otitọ rẹ.
Again, this is why you need a plan.	Lẹẹkansi, eyi ni idi ti o nilo eto kan.
They are waiting for us.	Wọn ti n duro de wa.
But that is not good enough.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko dara to.
You have to accept that.	O ni lati gba iyẹn.
Start with things that don’t appear.	Bẹrẹ pẹlu awọn ohun ti ko han.
No talking.	Ko si sọrọ.
Good to hear too.	O dara lati gbọ paapaa.
See text for details.	Wo ọrọ fun awọn alaye.
It should not be there.	Ko yẹ ki o ni wa nibẹ.
They will hold on to their one.	Wọn yoo di ọkan wọn mu.
Wash your hands often.	Fo ọwọ rẹ nigbagbogbo.
It was hard to see him go.	O jẹ lile lati ri i lọ.
Their injuries range from major to minor.	Awọn ipalara wọn wa lati pataki si kekere.
I do not want anyone.	Nko fe enikeni rara.
The first thing you do is think you are going to die.	Ohun akọkọ ti o ṣe ni ro pe iwọ yoo ku.
Notice.	Akiyesi.
You lose people, you love people.	O padanu eniyan, o nifẹ eniyan.
I know that my life will change dramatically.	Mo mọ pe igbesi aye mi yoo yipada ni pataki.
You have already said on that he is here to die.	O ti sọ tẹlẹ lori pe o wa nibi lati ku.
I want to know how you feel about me.	Mo fẹ lati mọ bi o ṣe lero nipa mi.
I know me.	Mo mọ mi.
For a few minutes, he thought about it.	Fun iṣẹju diẹ, o ronu rẹ.
More, more of mine.	Diẹ sii, diẹ sii ti mi.
That ever was.	Ti o lailai wà.
He talks about it.	O sọrọ nipa rẹ.
However, your area is clean.	Sibẹsibẹ, agbegbe rẹ mọ.
He came back after a long time.	O pada wa lẹhin igba pipẹ.
For a pair of shoes.	Fun bata bata.
And that is where the mistake is.	Ati pe iyẹn ni ibi ti o ṣe aṣiṣe.
People have to do so.	Awọn eniyan ni lati ṣe bẹ.
It’s human way.	O jẹ ọna eniyan.
I walked around to the driver's side.	Mo rin ni ayika si ẹgbẹ awakọ.
You will not know how to use it.	O ko ni mọ bi o ṣe le lo.
But that is not the case at all.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ri bẹẹ rara.
You need it.	O nilo rẹ.
I feel like a child.	Mo lero bi ọmọde.
Go back and see how it reads.	Pada pada ki o wo bi o ṣe n ka.
This is true.	Eyi jẹ otitọ.
And look there.	Ati ki o wo nibẹ.
I use them often.	Mo lo wọn nigbagbogbo.
Get out of here.	Jade sinu.
He loved himself.	O feran ara re.
Couldn't be easier !.	Ko le rọrun!.
I have a large family.	Mo ni idile nla kan.
It is such a.	O jẹ iru kan.
You don’t forget these things.	O ko gbagbe nkan wọnyi.
You can not wait.	O ko le duro.
And we don’t call the police.	Ati pe a ko ni pe ọlọpa.
I asked for help.	Mo beere fun iranlọwọ.
Sometimes you even use our site.	Nigba miiran o paapaa lo aaye wa.
The man with the first three names.	Ọkunrin naa pẹlu awọn orukọ akọkọ mẹta.
That is the question.	Eyi ni ibeere naa.
You won’t find someone who likes everything you want.	Iwọ kii yoo rii ẹnikan ti o fẹran ohun gbogbo ti o fẹ.
When we have dogs, we just leave them for him.	Nigba ti a ba ni awọn aja, a kan fi wọn silẹ fun u.
In some students.	Ni diẹ ninu awọn ọmọ iwe.
If you have problems inside, use.	Ti o ba ni iṣoro ninu, lo.
There are so many good things to learn.	Ọpọlọpọ nkan ti o dara wa lati kọ ẹkọ.
I haven't seen you lately.	Emi ko ri ọ laipẹ.
Why didn’t they just buy for that money ?, they asked.	Kilode ti wọn ko kan ra fun owo yẹn?, wọn beere.
I can't find it.	Emi ko le ri.
You have to play in every situation.	O ni lati ṣe ere ni gbogbo ipo.
In those three days, no words were used.	Ni ọjọ mẹta yẹn, ko si ọrọ ti a lo.
Most people are worried about this.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni aniyan nipa eyi.
He has not been asked or even asked for.	Ko ti beere rẹ tabi paapaa beere fun.
I just mean.	Mo kan tumọ si.
Find one you can use now.	Wa ẹni ti o le lo ni bayi.
I would absolutely look to just see this guy.	Emi yoo wo patapata lati kan rii eniyan yii.
You need to know what that is.	O nilo lati mọ kini iyẹn.
No one came for him.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa fun u.
No, you will not have time to bring anything.	Rara, iwọ kii yoo ni akoko lati mu ohunkohun wa.
Everyone stopped to look.	Gbogbo eniyan duro lati wo.
And stop trying so hard.	Ati ki o da gbiyanju ki lile.
And we did.	Ati pe a ṣe.
He also drank his other tea.	O tun mu tii rẹ miiran.
After giving me the truth, my life changed.	Lẹhin ti o ti fun mi ni otitọ, igbesi aye mi pada.
Or at least a little more.	Tabi o kere pupọ diẹ.
At one point, his name appeared on my phone.	Ni akoko kan, orukọ rẹ han lori foonu mi.
They all think about money.	Gbogbo wọn ro nipa owo.
I am a member of everyone.	Mo jẹ ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti gbogbo eniyan.
The city looks at a nearby town.	Ilu naa wo ilu ti o wa nitosi.
I saw a rope coming out of sight.	Mo rii okun kan ti n bọ kuro ni oju.
My husband can't be with me.	Ọkọ mi ko le wa pẹlu mi.
If you have anything to tell me, come see me yourself.	Ti o ba ni nkan lati sọ fun mi, wa ri mi funrararẹ.
As the industry has changed we have had to rebuild.	Bi ile-iṣẹ ti yipada a ti ni lati tun.
We do not want to take any chances.	A ko fẹ lati ya eyikeyi anfani.
None of them.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn.
This is where you can help us.	Eyi ni ibiti o le ṣe iranlọwọ fun wa.
Leave and better.	Fi silẹ ki o si dara julọ.
He is now asleep.	O sun bayi.
But you want one.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ ọkan.
I'll try to come.	Emi yoo gbiyanju lati wa.
And we came out of that world at a young age.	Ati pe a jade kuro ni aye yẹn ni ọdọ diẹ.
Well, you don't like it.	O dara, iwọ ko fẹran rẹ.
I do not, do not think it will.	Emi ko, ko ro o yoo.
And you want to get it and go to your head.	Ati pe o fẹ gba rẹ ki o lọ si ori rẹ.
I also changed.	Mo tun yipada.
That’s where you need to be.	Iyẹn ni ibi ti o nilo.
I can hear it.	Mo ti le gbọ ti o.
There are no two ways about it.	Ko si ọna meji nipa rẹ.
You just can't remember when, or why.	O kan ko le ranti igba, tabi idi.
Maybe they had some of the best moments in their lives.	Boya wọn jẹ diẹ ninu awọn akoko ti o dara julọ ni igbesi aye wọn.
Such a situation.	Iru ipo.
He does not know the exact reason.	Ko mọ idi ti o daju.
I think it could be yours.	Mo ro pe o le jẹ tirẹ.
He has great power.	O ni agbara nla.
Needing money, their parents sold them for their future husbands.	Ti o nilo owo, awọn obi wọn ta wọn fun awọn ọkọ wọn iwaju.
I am always alone.	Emi nikan ni nigbagbogbo.
I do not deserve to drive out here.	Emi ko yẹ lati wakọ jade nibi.
It takes one to know one.	O gba ọkan lati mọ ọkan.
We lost everything.	A padanu ohun gbogbo.
I told you he might have died.	Mo sọ fun ọ pe o le ti ku.
I use it all the time !.	Mo lo ni gbogbo igba!.
We would like to have some of it.	A yoo fẹ lati ni diẹ ninu rẹ.
I say this for several reasons.	Mo sọ eyi fun awọn idi pupọ.
Make sure everything is okay.	Rii daju pe ohun gbogbo dara.
Nothing is lost or forgotten.	Ko si ohun ti o padanu tabi gbagbe.
Can't imagine how.	Ko le ro ero bawo ni.
When he saw you out there.	Nigbati o ri ọ jade nibẹ.
Sign.	Fi ọwọ si.
Someone is talking about a body bag.	Ẹnikan n sọrọ nipa apo ara kan.
I haven’t seen him with a girl, not recently.	Emi ko ri i pẹlu ọmọbirin kan, kii ṣe laipẹ.
He can’t figure his way out of this.	Ko le sọrọ ọna rẹ jade ninu eyi.
I can not stand people.	Emi ko le duro ti eniyan.
I don’t think it will go right.	Emi ko ro pe yoo lọ ni otitọ.
We do everything together.	A ṣe ohun gbogbo papọ.
I am convinced that there is nothing there.	Mo da mi loju pe ko si nkankan nibẹ.
And that will be the end of it.	Ati pe iyẹn ni a yoo pari rẹ.
You will not be touched.	Iwọ kii yoo fi ọwọ kan ọ.
I will help you.	Emi yoo ran ọ lọwọ.
No need to.	Ko nilo lati.
Time will tell.	Akoko yoo sọ.
I could be there for years.	Mo le wa nibẹ fun ọdun.
It's just passing by the area.	O kan n kọja ni agbegbe naa.
He said he would call you back to me.	O ni oun yoo pe e ki o pada si odo mi.
We would be in trouble if they did not do so.	A yoo wa ninu wahala ti wọn ko ba ṣe bẹ.
Say you will.	Sọ pe iwọ yoo.
The streets are gone.	Awọn ita ti lọ.
Take the small road.	Gba opopona kekere naa.
When it’s time to work, we work.	Nigbati o to akoko lati ṣiṣẹ, a ṣiṣẹ.
You have to make a decision.	O gbọdọ ṣe ipinnu.
He did not tell his parents anything about that.	Ko sọ ohunkohun fun awọn obi rẹ nipa iyẹn.
So do not send them to us.	Nitorina maṣe fi wọn ranṣẹ si wa.
Great stuff.	Awọn nkan nla.
You will find it there.	Iwọ yoo ri i nibẹ.
Better than alive.	Dara ju laaye.
You look at your watch.	O wo aago rẹ.
I do not get in the way.	Emi ko gba ni ọna.
He took something and I broke it.	O mu nkan ti emi o si fọ.
Let us hear your book again.	Jẹ ki a tun gbọ iwe rẹ lẹẹkansi.
Important here.	Pataki nibi.
Her hair is missing.	Irun rẹ ti ko.
At first it was good.	Ni igba akọkọ ti o dara.
I am in my office.	Mo wa ni ọfiisi mi.
I turned to him.	Mo yipada si ọdọ rẹ.
After a month the two groups tested again.	Lẹhin oṣu kan awọn ẹgbẹ meji ni idanwo lẹẹkansi.
The question is what to do about it.	Ibeere naa ni kini lati ṣe nipa rẹ.
And you don’t get a lot of them.	Ati pe o ko gba ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn.
You should not even stand on your feet at this point.	Ko yẹ ki o paapaa dide lori ẹsẹ rẹ ni aaye yii.
I want me.	Mo fe mi.
The water is hot now.	Omi ti gbona bayi.
And grow, too.	Ati dagba, paapaa.
They removed the seat.	Wọn yọ ijoko naa kuro.
Nothing great, nothing great.	Ko si ohun nla, ko si ohun nla.
She knew how she felt about that house and her mother.	O mọ bi o ṣe lero nipa ile yẹn ati iya rẹ.
Two people entered the store.	Eniyan meji wọ ile itaja naa.
Many things do not understand.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan ko ni oye.
You also have things to do.	O tun ni awọn nkan lati ṣe.
The house is small.	Ile naa kere.
The program is for everyone to meet there after work.	Eto naa jẹ fun gbogbo eniyan lati pade nibẹ lẹhin iṣẹ.
You and he are very much in love.	Iwọ ati oun ni ifẹ pupọ.
He shook his head, and took her hand.	O mi ori, o si mu ọwọ rẹ.
When he got home he did not stay long.	Nigbati o de ile ko duro pẹ.
Wash your hair.	Fọ irun rẹ.
He could not stop completely.	Ko le da duro patapata.
Sometimes even before he died, that '.	Nigba miiran paapaa ṣaaju ki o to ku, iyẹn ni'.
You're done.	O to ṣe.
I would not like that on anyone.	Emi yoo ko fẹ pe lori ẹnikẹni.
This road is important for travel.	Opopona yii jẹ pataki fun irin-ajo.
I hope you understand.	Mo nireti pe o ti loye.
Find a way.	Wa ọna.
Or no, but of course he will try.	Tabi rara, ṣugbọn o dajudaju yoo gbiyanju.
If you are tired, sleep.	Ti o ba re re ki o sun.
He could not do anything.	Ko le ṣe ohunkohun.
There is no place to sit.	Ko si aaye lati joko.
Decide on the job you want.	Ṣe ipinnu iṣẹ ti o fẹ.
However, this work did not work.	Sibẹsibẹ, iṣẹ yii ko ṣe.
It is important that we get more people on board.	O ṣe pataki ki a gba eniyan diẹ sii lori ọkọ.
They said the meeting was wrong.	Wọn sọ pe ipade naa jẹ aṣiṣe.
Just meet at the appointment time.	Kan pade ni akoko adehun.
I hate to sell it.	Mo korira lati ta o.
We also received the books.	A tun gba awọn iwe naa.
Just stay there.	O kan duro nibẹ.
It always returns the same value.	O nigbagbogbo pada iye kanna.
To rent cars.	Lati ya awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
They are my strength.	Agbara mi ni won.
I mean, just about killing me.	Mo tumọ si, o kan nipa pa mi.
We ate all three meals together.	A jẹ gbogbo ounjẹ mẹta papọ.
It is hard to say.	O jẹ gidigidi lati sọ.
There is no cost.	Ko si iye owo.
Her mother is beautiful and also young.	Iya rẹ lẹwa ati ki o tun odo.
So it must have been here already.	Nitorina o gbọdọ ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
Both do not use the same method.	Awọn mejeeji ko lo ọna kanna.
It is very easy to get up and run with it.	O rọrun pupọ lati dide ati ṣiṣe pẹlu rẹ.
But most do it because you want to.	Ṣugbọn pupọ julọ o ṣe nitori o fẹ.
My mistake, of course.	Aṣiṣe mi, dajudaju.
There are two main reasons.	Nibẹ ni o wa meji idi idi.
Wear clothes and continue with it.	Wọ aṣọ ati tẹsiwaju pẹlu rẹ.
Perhaps the most intelligent man everyone lived.	Boya ọkunrin ti o ni oye julọ ti gbogbo eniyan gbe.
And about that.	Ati nipa iyẹn.
Help us !.	Ran wa lọwọ!.
However, there is an issue with this.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọrọ kan wa pẹlu eyi.
I really need to talk to him.	Mo nilo lati ba a sọrọ gaan.
He painted me an old family picture.	O ya mi ni aworan idile atijọ kan.
You want to buy, buy, buy.	O fẹ ra, ra, ra.
He wants to stay.	O fe duro.
You have to continue.	O ni lati tẹsiwaju.
It is, in fact.	O jẹ, ni otitọ.
He was there for a long time.	O wa nibẹ fun igba pipẹ.
Do not let the cat out.	Maṣe jẹ ki ologbo naa jade.
Do it for yourself.	Ṣe o fun ara rẹ.
I mean this is important.	Mo tumọ si eyi ni pataki.
Thus, to trouble itself.	Bayi, si wahala funrararẹ.
We can't get this over.	A ko le gba eyi lori.
That needs to be considered.	Iyẹn nilo lati ronu.
I want to help you out.	Mo fẹ lati ran ọ jade.
But music is very important.	Ṣugbọn orin ṣe pataki pupọ.
At least not in the way we understand space.	O kere kii ṣe ni ọna ti a loye aaye.
He is here with us.	O wa nibi pẹlu wa.
But he also learned.	Ṣugbọn o tun kọ ẹkọ.
And about time.	Ati nipa akoko.
We’ll see more tomorrow on that.	A yoo rii diẹ sii ni ọla lori iyẹn.
I am also sitting.	Emi naa joko.
This is a new type of tea.	Eyi jẹ iru tii tuntun kan.
Way.	Ọna.
He thought.	O ro.
Just leave that out.	Kan fi iyẹn silẹ.
But love will find a way.	Ṣugbọn ifẹ yoo wa ọna kan.
Three men were arrested this morning.	Awọn ọkunrin mẹta ni wọn mu ni owurọ yii.
It is mostly used by children.	O ti lo julọ nipasẹ awọn ọmọde.
However, not everything goes.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe ohun gbogbo lọ.
Almost no one else lives in this city right now.	O fẹrẹ jẹ pe ẹnikẹni miiran ngbe ni ilu yii ni bayi.
You better take that advice.	O dara o gba imọran naa.
We have heard about that.	A ti gbọ nipa iyẹn.
In fact, it has hit back.	Ni otitọ, o ti lu pada.
The information is all that anyone needs.	Alaye naa jẹ gbogbo ohun ti ẹnikẹni nilo.
Read that again because it is important.	Ka iyẹn lẹẹkansi nitori o ṣe pataki.
I just can’t believe it can be beautiful.	Mo kan ko le gbagbọ pe o le lẹwa.
They must be on their way early tomorrow morning.	Wọn gbọdọ wa ni ọna wọn ni kutukutu owurọ ọla.
They walk out of the office together.	Wọn jade kuro ni ọfiisi papọ.
I need more hours a day.	Mo nilo awọn wakati diẹ sii ni ọjọ.
No one asked me a question.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o beere ibeere kan fun mi.
He never let down good friends.	O ko jẹ ki awọn ọrẹ to dara silẹ.
We sat there for no reason.	A joko nibẹ fun ko si idi.
And put them in clothes.	Ki o si fi wọn sinu awọn aṣọ.
We think he killed it.	A ro pe o pa a.
Surprise,	Iyalẹnu,
Break the contract when you can.	Ge adehun nigba ti o le.
The kind of information we are told.	Iru alaye ti a sọ si wa.
Help her move if you want.	Ṣe iranlọwọ fun u lati gbe ti o ba fẹ.
Have tried just about everything.	Ti gbiyanju o kan nipa ohun gbogbo.
Everything is starting to come together now.	Ohun gbogbo ti bẹrẹ lati wa papọ ni bayi.
We still have.	A tun ni.
But his concern is with the past.	Ṣugbọn aniyan rẹ jẹ pẹlu ohun ti o ti kọja.
Just don't know where.	O kan ko mọ ibiti.
You always expect to leave your western city.	Nigbagbogbo o nireti lati lọ kuro ni ilu ti oorun rẹ.
A few bad days and you are on the road.	Awọn ọjọ buburu diẹ ati pe o wa ni opopona.
Of course, people can get wrong.	Dajudaju, awọn eniyan le gba aṣiṣe.
You will be on it soon.	Iwọ yoo wa lori rẹ laipẹ.
It can be a week or three weeks.	O le jẹ ọsẹ kan tabi ọsẹ mẹta.
Her legs slipped as she climbed down.	Ẹsẹ rẹ yọ bi o ti gun isalẹ.
I am sure someone will agree to it.	Mo ni idaniloju pe ẹnikan yoo gba si.
He has a plan for us, you know.	O ni eto fun wa, o mọ.
I am the person.	Emi ni eniyan naa.
Two new avenues have opened.	Awọn ọna tuntun meji ti ṣii.
Wait for the arrival.	Duro fun dide.
People see you, they are all dressed up.	Awọn eniyan ri ọ, gbogbo wọn ni aṣọ.
And we are here to stay.	Ati pe a wa nibi lati duro.
Everyone knows everyone.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ gbogbo eniyan.
We’re just talking about it.	A kan n sọrọ nipa rẹ.
In his pocket such a person.	Ninu apo rẹ iru eniyan.
The sister is not a teacher, but a teacher.	Arabinrin naa kii ṣe olukọ, ṣugbọn olukọ.
I think both are true.	Mo ro pe awọn mejeeji jẹ otitọ.
They did a beautiful job with two of my pictures.	Wọn ti ṣe kan lẹwa ise pẹlu meji ninu awọn aworan mi.
Most people leave the office on time.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan kuro ni ọfiisi ni akoko.
They changed big in the end.	Wọn yipada nla ni ipari.
I know what you want.	Mo mọ ohun ti o fẹ.
But again, that will take time.	Ṣugbọn lẹẹkansi, iyẹn yoo gba akoko.
And no one did anything about it.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe ohunkohun nipa rẹ.
They just do the music they want to do.	Wọn kan ṣe orin ti wọn fẹ lati ṣe.
Only a few are interested.	Nikan diẹ ni o nifẹ.
Those picking us up early this morning.	Awọn ti n gbe wa soke ni kutukutu owurọ yii.
Such is obviously not the law.	Iru ni o han ni ko ofin.
They had gone to a restaurant near the place.	Wọn ti lọ si ile ounjẹ kan nitosi ibi.
These are the best and will not do anything.	Awọn wọnyi ni o dara julọ kii yoo ṣe ohunkohun.
Eat more tea.	Je tii diẹ sii.
Do it on.	Ṣe o lori.
Make time for it.	Ṣe akoko fun o.
We cannot have one without it.	A ko le ni ọkan laisi rẹ.
This really scared me.	Eyi bẹru mi gaan.
Place your feet on the ceiling.	Gbe ẹsẹ rẹ si oke aja.
But everyone decided to move on.	Ṣugbọn gbogbo eniyan pinnu lati tẹsiwaju.
Like the world.	Bi aye.
Give this book a try.	Fun iwe yii ni idanwo.
I just look at it.	Mo kan wo e.
It is good news.	O jẹ iroyin ti o dara.
It didn’t take me long to figure it out.	O ko gba mi gun lati ro ero rẹ.
Your mother can start giving birth at any moment.	Iya rẹ le bẹrẹ lati bi ọmọ ni eyikeyi iṣẹju.
The best of them wore boat shoes.	Awọn ti o dara julọ ninu wọn wọ bata ọkọ oju omi.
We think it works well.	A ro pe o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
She is not happy or unhappy.	Inu re ko dun tabi ko dun.
All the same, he could not.	Gbogbo kanna, ko le.
He decided to stay.	O pinnu lati duro.
It is bad news.	O jẹ iroyin buburu.
There are several reasons for this.	Awọn idi pupọ lo wa fun eyi.
All of you.	Gbogbo yin.
Of course he was there.	Dajudaju o wa nibẹ.
You forgot birthday.	O gbagbe ojo ibi.
That is a good idea.	Ero to dara niyen.
He looked at me dead in the face.	O wo mi pe o ku ni oju.
Turn back.	Yipada sẹhin.
You will not understand about that.	Iwọ kii yoo loye nipa iyẹn.
I also agree with all your other suggestions.	Mo tun gba pẹlu gbogbo awọn imọran rẹ miiran.
You can wait.	O le duro.
It's too late to ask.	O ti pẹ ju lati beere lọwọ rẹ.
Switch to your hand.	Yipada si ọwọ rẹ.
It will be a good time !.	Yoo jẹ akoko ti o dara!.
That will tell you whether you will be fine.	Iyẹn yoo sọ fun ọ boya iwọ yoo dara.

This is both systems.	Eyi ni awọn ọna ṣiṣe mejeeji.
I have important things to do.	Mo ni awọn nkan pataki lati ṣe.
Here is one simple thing you can do.	Eyi ni ohun rọrun kan ti o le ṣe.
Test and make sure.	Ṣe idanwo ati rii daju.
This is going to be my site now.	Eyi yoo jẹ lilọ si aaye mi bayi.

Not the first time.	Kii ṣe igba akọkọ.
You know him as you do not know others.	O mọ rẹ bi ko mọ awọn miiran.
They even fear that their devices will be removed.	Wọn bẹru paapaa pe a yoo mu awọn ẹrọ wọn kuro.
This is a concern, please do not forget that.	Eyi jẹ aniyan, jọwọ ma ranti iyẹn.
You deserve to laugh.	O tọ lati rẹrin.
The car was parked outside the restaurant.	A gbe ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ si ita ile ounjẹ naa.
Neither text nor space around.	Bẹni ọrọ tabi aaye ni ayika.
The brother did not stop.	Arakunrin naa ko duro.
At night, he returned to where he had been.	Ni alẹ, o pada si ibi ti o ti ri.
I want to try another if it will work.	Mo fẹ lati gbiyanju miiran ti o ba ti yoo ṣiṣẹ.
We explain how to do it locally by community.	A ṣe alaye bi o ṣe le ṣe ni agbegbe nipasẹ agbegbe.
There are two points.	Awọn aaye meji wa.
Just know it.	O kan mọ ọ.
The room was clean and small.	Awọn yara je o mọ ki o kekere.
Lots of space in the big room.	Ọpọlọpọ aaye ninu yara nla.
Look again, if you do not believe me.	Wo lẹẹkansi, ti o ko ba gbagbọ mi.
He will of course.	Oun yoo dajudaju.
It has taught me a lot about myself.	O ti kọ mi pupọ nipa ara mi.
The same problem exists here.	Iṣoro kanna wa nibi.
He remembered the meeting in great detail.	O ranti ipade naa ni awọn alaye nla.
He refuses to accept it.	O kọ lati gba rẹ gba.
These materials are light and very durable.	Awọn ohun elo wọnyi jẹ ina ati ti o tọ pupọ.
You can read about the proposal here.	O le ka nipa imọran nibi.
I did not buy again.	Emi ko tun ra.

Now let’s see what I have.	Bayi jẹ ki a wo ohun ti Mo ni.
I love lifting.	Mo ni ife ti o gbe soke.
That went pretty well, but after that, not so good.	Ti o lọ lẹwa daradara, ṣugbọn lẹhin ti o, ko ki dara.
This takes more work than what has happened so far.	Eyi gba iṣẹ diẹ sii ju ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ lọ si bayi.
I think about it often and worry about it.	Mo ronu nipa rẹ nigbagbogbo ati ṣe aniyan nipa rẹ.
My own as well.	Ti ara mi pẹlu.
And it's not your fault, either.	Ati pe ko ṣe aṣiṣe rẹ, boya.
Same story with my husband.	Itan kanna pẹlu ọkọ mi.
He hurried into the room.	O yara wo inu yara naa.
If you want it that is.	Ti o ba fẹ rẹ niyen.
He won after his father.	O gba lẹhin baba rẹ.
However, it could not be that bad.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko le jẹ buburu yẹn.
I have to arrive at my store.	Mo ni lati de ile itaja mi.
It's over.	O kọja.
My teacher doesn’t seem to know why either.	Olukọ mi ko dabi pe o mọ idi boya.
It does not guarantee any type.	O ko ni idaniloju eyikeyi iru.
I just want you to spend time with us, please.	Mo kan fẹ ki o wa ni akoko pẹlu wa, jọwọ.
I do not want to grow up.	Emi ko fẹ lati dagba.
Not just today.	Kii ṣe loni nikan.
Find out where they are.	Wa ibi ti wọn wa.
No one is too sweet.	Ko si ọkan ti o dun ju.
We have to stay in the tree.	A ni lati duro ninu igi.
Maybe even a year.	Boya paapaa ọdun kan.
I wonder if it is one.	Mo ro boya o jẹ ọkan.
They have never met him.	Wọn ko tii pade rẹ rara.
They teach you how to do that.	Wọn kọ ọ bi o ṣe le ṣe iyẹn.
I do things my way.	Mo mu awọn nkan ṣe ni ọna mi.
Maybe tomorrow you will come.	Boya ni ọla o yoo wa.
They have not hit the city hard in a short time.	Wọn ko ti lu ilu naa ni lile ni igba diẹ.
We decided to be the people standing on the road.	A pinnu lati jẹ eniyan ti o duro ni opopona.
He is not too worried about.	Oun ko ni aniyan pupọ nipa.
It was the right decision for me.	O jẹ ipinnu ti o tọ fun mi.
You are my son, he said.	Ọmọ mi ni iwọ, o sọ.
It is early yet.	O ti wa ni kutukutu sibẹsibẹ.
That must be so.	Iyẹn gbọdọ jẹ bẹ.
That stood up.	Ti o duro soke.
It’s not that they’ll remember a lot when they go home.	Kii ṣe pe wọn yoo ranti pupọ nigbati wọn ba lọ si ile.
I use my company name.	Mo lo orukọ ile-iṣẹ mi.
I have returned.	Mo ti da pada.
Make a plan and use it.	Ṣe eto kan ki o lo.
And that was just as well, too.	Ati awọn ti o wà kan bi daradara, ju.
This is not a decision.	Eyi kii ṣe ipinnu.
Nothing really happened.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ gaan.
No need to say.	Ko si nilo lati sọ.
I did not ask him why.	Emi ko beere lọwọ rẹ idi.
When the bus pulls off, find a better way.	Nigbati ọkọ akero ba fa kuro, wa ọna ti o dara.
You should know better.	O yẹ ki o mọ dara julọ.
So don't go around that.	Nitorina maṣe yi nkan naa ka.
So this is how things will work.	Nitorina eyi ni bi awọn nkan yoo ṣe ṣiṣẹ.
Nothing was done.	Ko si ohun ti a ṣe.
People are not enough.	Awọn eniyan ko to.
Buy can not walk.	Ra ko ba le rin.
Don't feel.	Maṣe lero.
In fact, it takes a lot of wisdom.	Ni otitọ, o nilo ọgbọn pupọ.
That is a very good idea.	Iyẹn jẹ imọran ti o dara pupọ.
We feel that something is wrong here.	A lero wipe nkankan ti ko tọ nibi.
Some women do too.	Diẹ ninu awọn obinrin tun ṣe.
Get here.	Gba nibi.
Her house is full of cats.	Ile rẹ ti kun pẹlu awọn ologbo.
It was too hot, so he continued talking.	O gbona ju, nitorina o tẹsiwaju sọrọ.
No other words are necessary.	Ko si awọn ọrọ miiran jẹ pataki.
It’s a program you love to watch.	O jẹ eto ti o nifẹ lati wo.
I will live with you and your wife.	Emi yoo gbe pẹlu rẹ ati iyawo rẹ.
He knew this, but he still stood outside.	O mọ eyi, ṣugbọn o tun duro ni ita.
The city is a tourist destination.	Ilu naa jẹ aaye irin-ajo.
Of the company.	Ti ile-iṣẹ naa.
Tell them about yourself and let them help you.	Sọ fun wọn nipa ara rẹ ki o jẹ ki wọn ran ọ lọwọ.
But he thinks that will pass.	Ṣugbọn o ro pe iyẹn yoo kọja.
He said he could not help it.	O sọ pe oun ko le ran oun lọwọ.
I am alone with you, in your house.	Mo wa pẹlu rẹ nikan, ni ile rẹ.
And this should be easy.	Ati pe eyi yẹ ki o rọrun.
He reads everything.	O n ka gbogbo nkan.
For here we can look around everyone who has what they want.	Fun nibi a le wo ni ayika gbogbo eniyan ti o ni ohun ti wọn fẹ.
Move through it.	Gbe nipasẹ rẹ.
Please keep your voice down.	Jọwọ pa ohun rẹ silẹ.
I mean that’s my face.	Mo tumọ si pe oju mi ​​niyẹn.
When he got back into his boat, he sank.	Nigbati o pada sinu ọkọ oju omi rẹ, o sọ silẹ.
I will never worry again.	Emi kii yoo ni aniyan lẹẹkansi.
There is, of course, a lot more.	Nibẹ ni, dajudaju, pupọ diẹ sii.
It's too late, but it's time for the concert.	O pẹ de, ṣugbọn ni akoko fun ere orin naa.
I would like to go to the beach.	Emi yoo fẹ lati lọ si eti okun.
The story unites.	Itan naa di papọ.
The project requires great ingenuity.	Iṣẹ naa nilo ọgbọn nla.
Call us first order.	Pe wa akọkọ ofin.
I like.	Mo dabi.
If you call it you will not feel it.	Ti o ba pe o kii yoo ni imọran.
Until the door.	Titi ilẹkun.
Good it works.	O dara o ṣiṣẹ.
You will hear me.	Iwọ yoo gbọ mi.
He knew his father better than anyone.	O mọ baba rẹ ju ẹnikẹni lọ.
The problem is, it is a small area.	Iṣoro naa ni, o jẹ agbegbe kekere kan.
Children learn best through play.	Awọn ọmọde kọ ẹkọ ti o dara julọ nipasẹ ere.
He could not come without it.	Ko le wa laisi rẹ.
High for your age.	O ga fun ọjọ ori rẹ.
He has a brother.	O ni arakunrin kan.
Agree three times.	Ṣe adehun ni igba mẹta.
Let your worries go and ask.	Jẹ ki awọn aniyan rẹ lọ ki o beere.
It is a space without conditions.	O jẹ aaye laisi ipo.
They love their children.	Wọn nifẹ awọn ọmọ wọn.
They have a lot of great things to say about it.	Wọn ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun nla lati sọ nipa rẹ.
I really like my work.	Mo nifẹ iṣẹ mi gaan.
You may believe they gave us some music.	O le gbagbọ pe wọn fun wa ni orin diẹ.
They both know that.	Awọn mejeeji mọ iyẹn.
You do not know whether you think it.	O ko mọ boya o ro o.

In most cases.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
I know you don’t get it.	Mo mọ pe o ko gba a.
You know what you need.	O mọ ohun ti o nilo.
Any person will, in such situations.	Eyikeyi eniyan yoo, ni iru awọn ipo.
He reached for the door.	O de ọwọ́ ilẹkun.
We will become the recipients of a great city.	A yoo di awọn ti o gba ilu nla kan.
But others can.	Ṣugbọn awọn miiran le.
Past men smashed trees.	Ti o ti kọja awọn ọkunrin fọ igi.
She only lives in a small house.	O ngbe nikan ni ile kekere kan.
I love them so much.	Mo nifẹ wọn pupọ.
Call it out on it.	Pe e jade lori rẹ.
However, there are some problems.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn iṣoro kan wa.
I don't know you very well.	Emi ko mọ ọ daradara.
And yet, it is not without man at all.	Ati sibẹsibẹ, ko ṣe laisi eniyan rara.
That is to go.	Iyẹn ni lati lọ.
I played a game.	Mo ṣe ere kan.
He has friends.	O si ni awọn ọrẹ.
It gave me some energy.	O fun mi ni agbara diẹ.
The doors are open.	Awọn ilẹkun ti ṣi silẹ.
And no one should be killed.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti o yẹ ki o pa.
Your life may be a lot right now, but you have to try.	Igbesi aye rẹ le pupọ ni bayi, ṣugbọn o ni lati gbiyanju.
It is all one away, you see.	O ti wa ni gbogbo ọkan kuro, o ri.
To not accept.	Lati ma gba.
I don’t have much to say in that.	Emi ko ni ọrọ pupọ ninu iyẹn.
However, they did not receive as much water as they were paid for.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn ko gba omi pupọ bi wọn ti san fun.
The work is important but difficult.	Iṣẹ naa ṣe pataki ṣugbọn o nira.
Some were bad.	Diẹ ninu awọn wà buburu.
The book came from my brother.	Iwe naa wa lati ọdọ arakunrin mi.
You may want to check this out.	O le fẹ lati wo nkan yii.
Travel if possible.	Irin-ajo ti o ba ṣeeṣe.
They do not want to hear.	Wọn ko fẹ gbọ.
And you will be even.	Ati pe iwọ yoo jẹ paapaa.
Don't work too hard.	Maṣe ṣiṣẹ lile pupọ.
Not when he was the one who brought us to this.	Ko nigba ti o jẹ ẹniti o mu wa si eyi.
It can help some, and great.	O le ṣe iranlọwọ diẹ ninu awọn, ati nla.
Just a little sweet.	O kan diẹ dun.
But that is not for everyone.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe fun gbogbo eniyan.
Maybe that requires a lot.	Boya iyẹn n beere pupọ.
I love them back.	Mo nifẹ wọn pada.
We need a sense of purpose in what we do.	A nilo ori ti idi ninu ohun ti a ṣe.
But we can’t have that.	Ṣugbọn a ko le ni iyẹn.
I hope you are happy.	Mo nireti pe inu rẹ dun.
And this time, some of them may drive.	Ati ni akoko yii, diẹ ninu wọn le wakọ.
That is not my concern.	Iyẹn kii ṣe aniyan mi.
You must not leave early.	O ko gbọdọ lọ kuro ni kutukutu.
I just look at it.	Mo kan wo o.
They can be completely noticeable.	Wọn le ṣe akiyesi patapata.
It appears only to you.	O han si ọ nikan.
Not that.	Ko pe.
You remember that well.	O ranti pe daradara.
It can be both.	O le jẹ mejeeji.
You can do this outside of your work.	O le ṣe eyi ni ita iṣẹ rẹ.
I knew it was an impossible question.	Mo mọ pe o ṣee ṣe ibeere ti ko ṣeeṣe.
There is a house	Ile kan wa
Dad knew this.	Baba mọ eyi.
There are two groups.	Awọn ẹgbẹ meji wa nibẹ.
There is someone.	Ẹnikan wa.
Tell me what you want me to eat.	Sọ fun mi kini o fẹ ki n jẹ.
It was the only thing about me worth love.	O je nikan ni ohun nipa mi tọ ife.
Ask the store if you have any questions.	Beere ile itaja ti o ba ni ibeere eyikeyi.
Not for him.	Ko si fun u.
The first group has started.	Ẹgbẹ akọkọ ti bẹrẹ.
It took two years to get home.	O gba ọdun meji lati de ile.
Do not eat before the train arrives.	Maṣe jẹun ṣaaju ki ọkọ oju irin de.
This helps us in two ways.	Eyi ṣe iranlọwọ fun wa ni ọna meji.
Without his parents.	Laisi awọn obi rẹ.
Please come back.	Jọwọ pada wa.
You also have a lot to learn.	O tun ni ọpọlọpọ lati kọ ẹkọ.
Lots to experiment with.	Pupọ lati ṣe idanwo pẹlu.
Please leave your dog at home.	Jọwọ fi aja rẹ silẹ ni ile.
Some children happen to be born to the parents they have.	Awọn ọmọde kan ṣẹlẹ lati bi si awọn obi ti wọn ni.
She lost her most beloved sisters.	O padanu awọn arabinrin rẹ julọ julọ.
And we are not dead.	Ati pe a ko ti ku.
It was a test.	O jẹ idanwo kan.
Listen to their stories.	Gbọ awọn itan wọn.
Think about that in a minute.	Ronu nipa iyẹn ni iṣẹju kan.
I would know if you told him.	Emi yoo mọ ti o ba sọ fun u.
You see, it's very important, very little you do.	Wo o, o jẹ pataki pupọ, kekere ti o ṣe e.
Some less, some more.	Diẹ ninu awọn kere diẹ, diẹ ninu diẹ diẹ sii.
But there is a right way and a wrong way to live.	Ṣugbọn ọna ti o tọ ati ọna ti ko tọ wa lati gbe.
Please place your hand here.	Jọwọ gbe ọwọ rẹ si ibi.
They are also his people.	Wọn tun jẹ eniyan rẹ.
Apparently he’s taking names.	O han gbangba pe o n mu awọn orukọ.
And not only that, this boy.	Ati pe ko nikan, ọmọkunrin yii.
No words for yourself.	Ko si ọrọ fun ara rẹ.
I feel good already.	Mo lero dara tẹlẹ.
Please take care of it.	Jọwọ tọju rẹ.
I would like to leave that out of the question as well.	Emi yoo fẹ lati fi iyẹn silẹ kuro ninu ibeere naa daradara.
In a way, this is what we are told.	Ni ọna kan, eyi jẹ ki a sọ fun wa.
They continue in this way for a while.	Wọn tẹsiwaju ni ọna yii fun igba diẹ.
Working out.	Ṣiṣẹ nkan jade.
Someone is calling us.	Ẹnikan n pe wa.
I had to leave the bar.	Mo ni lati lọ kuro ni igi.
There is nothing to build a house about.	Ko si nkankan lati kọ ile nipa.
It has become much better.	Ti di dara julọ.
So this is what it can be with a man.	Nitorina eyi jẹ ohun ti o le jẹ pẹlu ọkunrin kan.
The little boy climbed on his parents' feet.	Ọmọkunrin kekere naa gun ori ẹsẹ awọn obi rẹ.
The room is hot.	Yara naa gbona.
You know what they are.	O mọ kini wọn jẹ.
The future is there.	Ojo iwaju wa nibẹ.
For a love story.	Fun ife itan.
Abandoned.	Ti fi i silẹ.
I am coming to you.	Mo n bọ si ọdọ rẹ.
You can try, but you will not.	O le gbiyanju, ṣugbọn iwọ kii yoo ṣe.
It’s amazing we remember nothing at all.	O jẹ iyanu a ranti ohunkohun ni gbogbo.
They did it for me.	Wọn ṣe fun mi.
You can see how much it costs him to say this to her.	O le rii iye ti o jẹ fun u lati sọ eyi fun u.
For a mother it is very hot.	Fun iya kan o gbona pupọ.
I can't look them in the eye.	Emi ko le wo wọn ni oju.
The rain is almost over.	Ojo ti fẹrẹ pari.
I know it will not last forever.	Mo mọ pe kii yoo duro lailai.
What you remember will change you.	Ohun ti o ranti yoo yi ọ pada.
They say they have not reached an agreement at all.	Wọn sọ pe wọn ko tii adehun rara.
I will do so.	Emi yoo ṣe bẹ.
Most of them are in a small button and sound sweet.	Pupọ ninu wọn wa ni bọtini kekere kan ati dun dun.
I just love everything about it.	Mo kan nifẹ ohun gbogbo nipa rẹ.
I can tell you that this is happening everywhere.	Mo le sọ fun ọ pe eyi n ṣẹlẹ nibi gbogbo.
This house has been around for over a year.	Ile yii ti ju igba ọdun lọ.
In a learned mindset, what causes this problem?	Ninu ero ti o kọ ẹkọ, kini o fa iṣoro yii?
None of the men have any, or they will give it.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ọkunrin ti o ni eyikeyi, tabi ti won yoo fun o.
I need to work on more.	Mo nilo lati ṣiṣẹ lori awọn diẹ sii.
He did nothing to help.	Ko ṣe ohunkohun lati ṣe iranlọwọ.

I am good at my job.	Mo dara ni iṣẹ mi.
I am very happy.	Inu mi dun pupo.
I got up and went out.	Mo dide mo si jade.
Maybe he doesn't know that either.	Boya oun naa ko mọ iyẹn.
It was completely solid.	O je patapata ri to.
I'll get it here.	Emi yoo gba a nibi.
Here is what needs to happen.	Eyi ni ohun ti o nilo lati ṣẹlẹ.
They are too old for the program.	Wọn ti dagba ju fun eto naa.
Many people died.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ku.
But it never really happened.	Sugbon o ko gan ṣẹlẹ.
I know to work late at night.	Mo ti mọ lati ṣiṣẹ pẹ ni alẹ.
They could not reach the river without a boat.	Wọn ko le de ọdọ odo laisi ọkọ oju omi.
So he took his dog with him.	Nitorina o mu aja rẹ pẹlu rẹ.
Which, by the way, is about the same.	Eyi ti, nipasẹ ọna, jẹ nipa kanna.
We have grown to it as it is.	A ti dagba si i bi o ti jẹ.
We want it to grow.	A fẹ ki o dagba.
One minute, there you are.	Iṣẹju kan, nibẹ o wa.
I give more details.	Mo fun awọn alaye diẹ sii.

His mouth was moving.	Ẹnu rẹ n gbe.
He gave me life.	O fun mi ni aye.
I know it is not easy for any of you.	Mo mọ pe ko rọrun fun eyikeyi ninu yin.
He cannot feel or understand.	Ko le ni rilara tabi loye.
Pictures from the crash site.	Awọn aworan lati ibi ijamba.
I never thought of it.	Emi ko tii ronu rẹ rara.
It tells an amazing story.	O sọ itan iyalẹnu kan.
Something has taken advantage of them.	Ohun kan ti gba anfani wọn.
I found a locked place out front and locked up.	Mo ti ri kan pa ibi jade iwaju ati ki o pa soke.
Get out of here now.	Wa kuro ni bayi.
You also want to try.	O tun fẹ gbiyanju.
I can't go back to that.	Emi ko le pada si iyẹn.
He met with an unpleasant surprise when he returned home.	O pade pẹlu iyalẹnu ti ko dun nigbati o pada si ile.
But, this is not enough.	Ṣugbọn, eyi ko to.
Something you think is important.	Nkankan ti o ro pe o ṣe pataki.
There are people like this.	Awọn eniyan bii eyi wa.
And that is.	Ati pe iyẹn ni.
This home is everything we will ever want or need.	Eyi ni ile jẹ ohun gbogbo ti a yoo fẹ tabi nilo lailai.
Eyes that probably attract little attention.	Oju ti o jasi fa kekere akiyesi.
I don’t know if we are at that point yet.	Emi ko mọ boya a wa ni aaye yẹn sibẹsibẹ.
First, we need to note that there is another system.	Ni akọkọ, a nilo lati ṣe akiyesi pe eto miiran wa.
Not everything is right.	Ko ṣe ohun gbogbo ti o tọ.
Whether we know it or not.	Boya a mọ tabi ko.
That is if we finish in time.	Iyẹn jẹ ti a ba pari ni akoko.
We accept this.	A gba eleyi.
You should have seen his face.	O yẹ ki o ti ri oju rẹ.
I just don’t know where I went from here.	Mo kan ko mọ ibiti mo ti lọ lati ibi.
I became a small bag.	Mo di apo kekere kan.
There was little time to lose.	Nibẹ wà kekere akoko lati padanu.
They may fear that no one will take care of them.	Wọn le bẹru pe ko si ẹnikan ti yoo tọju wọn.
However, in some cases.	Sibẹsibẹ, ni awọn igba miiran.
This is the only body we get.	Eyi nikan ni ara ti a gba.
So just this one time again.	Nitorina o kan eyi ni akoko kan lẹẹkansi.
He said he wanted to come back.	O sọ pe o fẹ lati pada.
I'm sorry, too.	Emi naa binu, paapaa.
But man can beat.	Ṣugbọn ọkunrin eniyan le lu.
If you want, the rule may not apply.	Ti o ba fẹ, ofin naa le ma lo.
He said he did not remember.	O ni oun ko ranti.
It's still raining.	Ojo si tun n ro.
Everyone wants to talk for the last time.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ lati sọrọ fun igba ikẹhin.
I have many of these.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ ninu awọn wọnyi.
Both can work well together.	Awọn mejeeji le ṣiṣẹ daradara papọ.
Students have lots of room.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ni ọpọlọpọ yara.
It seems that everything is working fine.	O dabi pe ohun gbogbo n ṣiṣẹ daradara.
You, and those little girls.	Iwọ, ati awọn ọmọbirin kekere yẹn.
It is already there.	O wa nibẹ tẹlẹ.
One, when you have done something wrong.	Ọkan, nigbati o ba ti ṣe nkan ti ko tọ.
I can do that better than you can.	Mo le ṣe iyẹn dara julọ ju ti o le lọ.
Your interest was not hot, at best.	Rẹ anfani je ko gbona, ni o dara ju.
It takes place.	O gba aye.
You should definitely go to these places.	O yẹ ki o lọ si awọn aaye wọnyi gaan.
It will be very easy.	Yoo rọrun pupọ.
There are also some small houses.	Awọn ile kekere kan tun wa.
And you did not find anything that you would not expect to find in such a place.	Ati pe ko rii ohunkohun ti iwọ kii yoo nireti lati rii ni iru aaye bẹẹ.
Do it back.	Ṣe o pada.
Just about out of town.	Kan nipa jade ti ilu.
But even this is problematic.	Ṣugbọn paapaa eyi ni awọn iṣoro.
All you need to do is go, go, go.	Gbogbo ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe ni lilọ, lọ, lọ.
He could not change himself.	Ko le yi ara rẹ pada.
It is a simple task.	O jẹ iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
Come on, it's all over.	Wa, gbogbo rẹ gba.
But in most cases it is not.	Ṣugbọn ni ọpọlọpọ igba kii ṣe bẹ.
It does not call for parents.	Ko ni pe awon obi wa.
But that is not right.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko tọ.
I would not even tell them about it.	Emi yoo ko paapaa sọ fun wọn nipa rẹ.
It was a long time, he thought.	O je igba pipẹ, o ro.
About everyone, myself included.	Nipa gbogbo eniyan, ara mi pẹlu.
I went through it.	Mo ti lọ nipasẹ rẹ.
Everyone took their opinion from him.	Gbogbo eniyan gba ero wọn lọwọ rẹ.
They will tell you nothing.	Wọn yoo sọ ohunkohun fun ọ.
Some things we do not yet know.	Diẹ ninu awọn ohun ti a ko mọ sibẹsibẹ.
I have my children back and now life can go on.	Mo ni awọn ọmọ mi pada ati ni bayi igbesi aye le tẹsiwaju.
We know it will take some time.	A mọ pe yoo gba akoko diẹ.
He took it up and asked them to move out.	O ya soke o si beere fun wọn lati gbe jade.
I want you to not doubt yourself.	Mo fẹ ki o ma ṣe ṣiyemeji funrararẹ.
Obviously we decided to come together.	O han ni a pinnu lati wa papọ.
But he also looks young.	Ṣugbọn o tun dabi ọmọde.
Every song is important.	Gbogbo orin jẹ pataki.
I am not sure if any of that is true.	Emi ko ni idaniloju pe eyikeyi ninu iyẹn jẹ otitọ.
Life does not just begin at this time, it continues to exist.	Igbesi aye ko kan bẹrẹ ni akoko yii, o tẹsiwaju lati wa.
It's even better for me.	Paapaa o dara si mi.
The reason for this is explained by a simple idea.	Idi fun eyi ni a ṣe alaye nipasẹ imọran ti o rọrun kan.
Let me paint you.	Jẹ ki n kun ọ.
We will be back for sure !.	A yoo pada wa daju!.
I am so good.	Mo ki o dara.
People do things.	Awọn eniyan ṣe awọn nkan.
But these are big questions.	Ṣugbọn awọn ibeere nla ni wọnyi.
We want them back with us.	A fẹ wọn pada pẹlu wa.
Like these observations.	Bi akiyesi wọnyi.
One for the boys.	Ọkan fun awọn ọmọkunrin.
I want the book.	Mo fe iwe naa.
I want to get married to my husband.	Mo fẹ lati ni iyawo si ọkọ mi.
I go to school.	Mo lọ si ile-iwe.
Let them stay at home.	Jẹ ki wọn duro ni ile.
Or, maybe, forever.	Tabi, boya, lailai.
Test love.	Idanwo ife.
Not before, and not now.	Ko ṣaaju, ati ki o ko bayi.
He refuses to see you.	O kọ lati ri ọ.
He knew it was going to be bad, too.	O mọ pe o ti fẹrẹ di buburu, paapaa.
I'll call you tomorrow.	Emi yoo foonu rẹ ọla.
Someone did this for you.	Ẹnikan ṣe eyi fun ọ.
He left the scene.	O fi aaye naa silẹ.
That was good enough for me.	Iyẹn dara to fun mi.
Others please contact us.	Awọn miiran jọwọ kan si wa.
We did not wait long.	A ko duro pẹ.
I have a plan for you and me.	Mo ni eto kan fun iwọ ati emi.
The sun is in my eyes.	Oorun wa ni oju mi.
Best get some sleep.	Ti o dara ju gba oorun diẹ.
But he will take his time.	Ṣugbọn oun yoo gba akoko rẹ.
But obviously this is not possible.	Ṣugbọn o han gbangba pe eyi ko ṣee ṣe.
It's your problem.	Iṣoro rẹ ni.
If the group is smaller, it can cause more travel.	Ti ẹgbẹ ba kere, o le fa irin-ajo diẹ sii.
Even that would not be.	Paapaa iyẹn kii yoo jẹ.
They need a new teacher.	Wọn nilo olukọ tuntun kan.
What everyone is looking for.	Ohun ti gbogbo eniyan n wa.
It works.	O si ṣe.
You will go try to forget about the project.	O yoo lọ gbiyanju lati gbagbe nipa iṣẹ naa.
It can be hard to stand.	O le nira lati duro.
He did not kill him.	Ko pa a.
They are physical people.	Wọn jẹ eniyan ti ara.
We have known each other for a long time.	A ti mọ ara wa fun igba pipẹ.
You should do this early in the day.	O yẹ ki o ṣe eyi ni kutukutu ọjọ.
Don't forget it.	Maṣe gbagbe rẹ.
So they are the same.	Nitorina wọn jẹ kanna.
Most people want you to die.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan fẹ ki o ku.
It is not appropriate for a person to drink.	Ko yẹ fun eniyan lati mu.
But you will need to change a few things.	Ṣugbọn iwọ yoo nilo lati yi awọn nkan diẹ pada.
I'm glad you saw it.	Inu mi dun pe o ri e.
Now this is the problem.	Bayi iṣoro naa ni eyi.
Music does not.	Orin ko ṣe.
I refuse to go.	Mo kọ lati lọ.
One is the most.	Ọkan ni julọ.
We lost our purpose and our way.	A padanu idi wa ati ọna wa.
Seen that they can not live without it.	Ti ri pe wọn ko le gbe laisi rẹ.
Let's hear the word.	Jẹ ki a gbọ ọrọ.
Look, it's a great game, let's just move on with it.	Wo, ere nla ni, jẹ ki a kan tẹsiwaju pẹlu rẹ.
He is determined to do just that.	O ti pinnu lati ṣe iyẹn.
And so is written.	Ati bẹ ti wa ni kọ.
He hit the ball well.	O lu bọọlu daradara.
He died two weeks ago.	O ku ọsẹ meji.
How much do you love them.	Elo ni o nifẹ wọn.
Maybe they will give you more.	Boya wọn yoo fun ọ ni diẹ sii.
I have room to reach more people.	Mo ni aye lati de ọdọ awọn eniyan diẹ sii.
They think it hasn’t changed enough.	Wọn ro pe ko yipada to.
His facts speak for themselves.	Awọn otitọ rẹ sọ fun ara wọn.
It is not new.	Kii ṣe tuntun.
I get up.	Mo dide.
Come, come with me.	Wa, wa pẹlu mi.
Okay, almost no one.	O dara, o fẹrẹ ko si ẹnikan.
I let it write for me.	Mo jẹ ki o kọ silẹ fun mi.
We all sat in the same room.	Gbogbo wa joko ni yara kan.
We will try again next week.	A yoo tun gbiyanju ni ọsẹ to nbọ.
They start the same day.	Wọn bẹrẹ ni ọjọ kanna.
Maybe it is.	Boya o jẹ.
In the end.	Ni ipari.
Both can be fired under water.	Mejeeji le wa ni ina labẹ omi.
It should be here any minute.	O yẹ nibi eyikeyi iṣẹju.
You get what you can get.	O gba ohun ti o le gba.
They only told me what they wanted me to know.	Ohun ti wọn fẹ ki n mọ nikan ni wọn sọ fun mi.
You always forget things.	Nigbagbogbo o gbagbe awọn nkan.
I would like to see the works.	Emi yoo fẹ lati wo awọn iṣẹ naa.
I sold my first book.	Mo ti ta mi akọkọ iwe aworan.
You should not have been here.	O yẹ ki o ko ti wa nibi.
I would like to ask questions.	Emi yoo beere awọn ibeere.
You can always talk to me.	O le nigbagbogbo sọrọ si mi.
No one in history is surprised.	Ko si enikeni ninu itan ti o ya.
The books sell well.	Awọn iwe naa ta daradara.
You will have some tomorrow.	Iwọ yoo ni diẹ ninu ọla.
You have to hurry, but not too fast.	O ni lati yara, ṣugbọn kii ṣe yara ju.
My brother will never be the same.	Arakunrin mi yoo ko jẹ kanna.
A place to stay.	Ibi kan lati duro.
Maybe they don’t.	Boya wọn ko ni.
Sit down with me and talk.	Joko pẹlu mi ki o sọrọ.
They say it’s eye-catching.	Wọn sọ pe o jẹ oju lati wo.
We have not heard from him anymore.	A ko tii gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ mọ.
That means he has no power.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe ko ni agbara.
But that was really good for me.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn dara fun mi gaan.
But this time it is very important.	Sugbon akoko yi o jẹ gidigidi pataki.
You can’t get out of that.	O ko le gba kuro ninu iyẹn.
As a place for me here.	Bi aaye kan wa fun mi nibi.
The sun is coming up.	Oorun n bọ.
In terms of value.	Ni awọn ofin ti iye.
It is without any desire to have a home.	O jẹ laisi ifẹ eyikeyi lati ni ile kan.
I think it will play again.	Mo ro pe o yoo mu lẹẹkansi.
I really miss them.	Mo padanu wọn gaan.
So, just head up.	Nitorina, o kan ori soke.
He loves his work.	O nifẹ iṣẹ rẹ.
Promises were made, but they were not kept.	A ṣe awọn ileri, ṣugbọn a ko pa wọn mọ.
The boy is enjoying his favorite game.	Ọmọkunrin naa n gbadun ere ayanfẹ rẹ.
That is a good decision.	Iyẹn jẹ ipinnu to dara.
You don’t want to remember.	O ko fẹ lati ranti.
Take us your car.	Ya wa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ.
In the end, he looked me up.	Ni ipari, o wo mi soke.
You must know more.	O gbọdọ mọ diẹ sii.
You can open it now.	O le ṣi i ni bayi.
However, that did not work.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn ko ṣiṣẹ.
I have lost myself and found myself many times.	Mo ti padanu ara mi ati ki o ri ara mi ọpọlọpọ igba.
It has been so in the past.	O ti jẹ bẹ ni igba atijọ.
No how, no way.	Rara bawo, ko si ọna.
He could not say anything else.	Ko le sọ ohunkohun miiran.
There are two possible cases.	Nibẹ ni o wa meji ṣee ṣe igba.
There is no time to finish the job.	Ko si akoko lati pari iṣẹ naa.
The bad news is, they don’t have the right one.	Awọn iroyin buburu ni, wọn ko ni eyi ti o tọ.
The children will die.	Awọn ọmọde yoo ku.
The promises are personal.	Awọn ileri jẹ ti ara ẹni.
You're driving too, drivers!	O n wakọ ju, awakọ!
Have a true lesson.	Ni ẹkọ otitọ.
I'm trying to figure out what to say, how to put this.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ro ohun ti lati sọ, bi o si fi yi.
It sounds a little weird.	O dun diẹ diẹ.
Maybe it is.	Boya o jẹ.
It is impossible that we cannot see.	Ko ṣee ṣe pe a ko le rii.
You know, boats need water.	O mọ, awọn ọkọ oju omi nilo omi.
Her children have grown up.	Awọn ọmọ rẹ ti dagba.
We are brothers.	A jẹ arakunrin.
You can read and write.	O le ka ati kọ.
However, we do not believe that the law is applicable, here.	Sibẹsibẹ, a ko gbagbọ pe ofin ni ohun elo, nibi.
I agree.	Mo gba.
I was an old man.	Mo ti wà ohun atijọ eniyan.
Well done.	Daradara a ti ṣe.
If only all cats could do that.	Ti o ba jẹ pe gbogbo awọn ologbo le ṣe iyẹn.
Start with.	Bẹrẹ pẹlu .
He looked at the phone.	O wo foonu naa.
And here it was, happening again.	Ati ki o nibi ti o wà, ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
Believe and you will believe anything.	Gbagbọ ati pe iwọ yoo gbagbọ ohunkohun.
They may need to change or move.	Wọn le nilo lati yipada tabi gbe.
He is here to see you every day.	O wa nibi lati wo ọ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
He has no friends.	Ko ni awọn ọrẹ.
This has been difficult to write.	Eyi ti nira lati kọ.
Your life does not have to change much.	Igbesi aye rẹ ko ni lati yipada pupọ.
And think about it, that would be great.	Ati pe ki o ronu rẹ, iyẹn yoo dara pupọ.
We have a lot of work to do.	A ni ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ lati ṣe.
He did not know why he did this to himself.	Ko mọ idi ti o fi ṣe eyi si ara rẹ.
That was less than a week.	Iyẹn ko ju ọsẹ kan lọ.
That is your job.	Iyẹn ni iṣẹ rẹ.
Or it should have been done.	Tabi o yẹ ki o ti ṣe.
We have nothing to do with it.	A ko ni nkankan lati se pẹlu ti o.
But it is the best thing you can do.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ohun ti o dara julọ ti o le ṣe.
Please help us.	Jọwọ ran wa lọwọ.
They are not, but you do not know.	Wọn kii ṣe, ṣugbọn iwọ ko mọ.
This change.	Yipada yi pada.
Drive up there about three in the morning.	Wakọ soke nibẹ nipa mẹta owurọ.
Few people are born better.	Diẹ eniyan ti wa ni a bi to dara julọ.
Not sure on that either.	Ko daju lori wipe boya.
They have agreed to get married.	Wọn ti ṣe adehun lati ṣe igbeyawo.
He was determined to make a comeback.	O ti pinnu lati ṣe pada.
Men do not understand.	Awọn ọkunrin ko loye.
I did not, at first, look at the driver.	Emi ko, ni akọkọ, wo awakọ naa.
This fact alone is not enough.	Otitọ kan yii ko to.
My shoes for work.	Awọn bata mi fun iṣẹ.
Maybe my father's name will be on it.	Boya orukọ baba mi yoo wa lori rẹ.
I know everything about my people.	Mo mọ ohun gbogbo nipa awọn eniyan mi.
Take my store.	Gba ile itaja mi.
But it was also incredibly easy.	Sugbon o je tun ti iyalẹnu rọrun.
Make great music.	Ṣe orin nla.
You have eaten enough.	O ti jẹun to.
You know something is up.	O mọ nkankan ni soke.
I’m sure many of these are pretty good.	Mo ni idaniloju pe ọpọlọpọ ninu awọn wọnyi dara dara.
And, even if they do, they may not remember.	Ati pe, paapaa ti wọn ba ṣe, wọn le ma ranti.
After us, more is coming.	Lẹhin wa, diẹ sii n bọ.
Return the money.	Pada owo naa pada.
He sat up.	O joko soke.
Maybe you will have to.	Boya o yoo ni lati.
Of course the young person should understand why.	Dajudaju o yẹ ki ọdọ naa ni oye idi.
Of many things.	Ti ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
No more talking in it today.	Ko si sọrọ ninu rẹ mọ loni.
They say no, that's not what they see.	Wọn sọ rara, iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti wọn rii.
I don’t really know anything about it.	Emi ko mọ nkankan nipa rẹ gan.
Keep your eyes on it.	Fi oju rẹ si.
I know it is, son.	Mo mọ pe o jẹ, ọmọ.
You are in error, not me.	O wa ninu aṣiṣe, kii ṣe emi.
The problem is usually the rain.	Nigbagbogbo iṣoro naa jẹ ojo diẹ.
We let them feel how important they are.	A jẹ ki wọn lero bi wọn ṣe pataki.
And how does that apply today.	Ati bawo ni iyẹn ṣe kan loni.
They started to hate me.	Wọn bẹrẹ lati korira mi.
People who are not removed from the community.	Awon eniyan ti won ko kuro lati agbegbe.
You can go as your heart lets you go.	O le lọ si bi ọkan rẹ ṣe jẹ ki o lọ.
More people will buy this car in the coming months.	Eniyan diẹ sii yoo ra ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yii ni awọn oṣu to n bọ.
Use less energy.	Lo agbara diẹ.
Most people do not yet know why they are there.	Pupọ julọ awọn eniyan ko tii mọ idi ti wọn fi wa nibẹ.
Who will tell them?	Tani yoo sọ fun wọn?
Students enjoy music more than anything else.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe gbadun orin ju ohunkohun miiran lọ.
But we are just good friends.	Sugbon a wa ni o kan ti o dara ọrẹ.
After the first.	Lẹhin akọkọ.
The people are angry.	Awọn ara ilu ti binu.
Let him walk.	Jẹ ki o rin.
Or so it seems.	Tabi ki o dabi.
We did clean up some.	A ṣe nu soke diẹ ninu awọn.
He closed his eyes, opened them.	O di oju rẹ, o ṣi wọn.
It may be a few more weeks.	O le jẹ ọsẹ diẹ diẹ sii.
They are only themselves, whether they like it or not.	Wọn nikan ni ara wọn, boya wọn fẹ tabi rara.
And we don’t have to go home in two weeks.	Ati pe a ko ni lati lọ si ile ni ọsẹ meji.
If you have, this will not be on the table.	Ti o ba ni, eyi kii yoo wa lori tabili.
They sound great.	Wọn dun nla.
Everyone is given his space.	Gbogbo eniyan ni a fun ni aaye rẹ.
You need more than that in your life.	O nilo diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ ninu igbesi aye rẹ.
Not in history.	Ko si ninu itan.
We are educated people.	A jẹ eniyan ti o kọ ẹkọ.
That place may account for you.	Ibi yẹn le ni iroyin fun ọ.
His work gave him a great position.	Iṣẹ rẹ fun u ni ipo nla.
What kind of person.	Iru eniyan wo.
Two men notice.	Awọn ọkunrin meji ṣe akiyesi.
He tried to open it.	O gbiyanju lati ṣii.
So they decided to build a big house.	Nitorina wọn pinnu lati kọ ile nla kan.
You do not have to change anything.	O ko ni lati yi ohunkohun pada.
Now, it just seems to stay there.	Bayi, o kan dabi lati duro nibẹ.
None of the devices are noticeable.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ẹrọ ti o ṣe akiyesi.
But no.	Ṣugbọn ko si.
It looks like it's working right now.	O dabi pe o n ṣiṣẹ ni bayi.
He began to back away from it.	O bẹrẹ lati pada sẹhin kuro ninu rẹ.
I never went back to my parents.	Emi ko pada si ọdọ awọn obi mi.
I know your story.	Mo mọ itan rẹ.
But this takes time.	Ṣugbọn eyi gba akoko.
I don’t mean to cut you off.	Emi ko tumọ lati ge ọ kuro.
Which is not the point of this at all.	Eyi ti kii ṣe aaye ti eyi rara.
No agreement required.	Ko si adehun ti o nilo.
Here is what he did.	Eyi ni ohun ti o ṣe.
You don’t have to notice that.	O ko ni lati ṣe akiyesi bẹ.
You should sleep on the bed.	O yẹ ki o sun lori ibusun.
What dog are you calling?	Aja wo ni o n pe?
I can see again.	Mo ti le ri lẹẹkansi.
I think they have found me.	Mo ro pe wọn ti ri mi.
And with people angry about it.	Ati pẹlu eniyan binu nipa rẹ.
We will all go.	Gbogbo wa ni yoo lọ.
You do not know what to do.	O ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
And really, really good.	Ati ni otitọ, o dara gaan.
This is the cause.	Eleyi je fa.
Man cannot go back.	Eniyan ko le pada sẹhin.
She tells him she has something to tell him.	O sọ fun u pe o ni nkankan lati sọ fun u.
You are wondering now.	O ṣe iyalẹnu ni bayi.
I call you home.	Mo pe e ni ile.
It will happen at some point.	Yoo ṣẹlẹ ni aaye kan.
They just started out.	Wọn kan bẹrẹ si jade.
I will give it to you after that.	Emi yoo fun ọ lẹhin eyi.
I heard about that.	Mo ti gbọ nipa ti.
Contact us today !.	Kan si wa loni!.
The weather is nice today.	Oju ojo dara loni.
His meeting was still very difficult for me.	Ipade rẹ si tun nira pupọ fun mi.
Just stop there and watch me drive away.	O kan duro nibẹ o si wo mi ti n wakọ lọ.
For this family, education is key.	Fun idile yii, ẹkọ jẹ bọtini.
The required application is simple.	Ohun elo ti a beere jẹ rọrun.
Wa a.	Wa a.
He can't see anything.	Ko le ri nkankan gaan.
It’s hard to pull off but it’s also important.	O nira lati fa kuro ṣugbọn tun ṣe pataki.
We are not happy to see them.	A ko dun lati ri wọn.
It was small and sweet and could not be touched.	O jẹ kekere ati dun ati pe ko le fi ọwọ kan.
Think nothing of it.	Ronu ohunkohun nipa rẹ.
I want to tell you something.	Mo fe so fun o nkankan.
It will be a hard one.	Yoo jẹ ọkan lile.
And it's time.	Ati pe o to akoko.
Do not forget who you are.	Maṣe gbagbe ẹni ti o jẹ.
He treats us well here.	O tọju wa daradara nibi.
That is great you can do.	Ti o jẹ nla o le ṣe.
Look at your house on the beach.	Ile re wo loju okun.
We have it all day.	A ni gbogbo ọjọ.
It makes me hate it.	O mu ki mi korira rẹ.
I was afraid of the place.	Mo bẹru ibi naa.
It was not about money.	O je ko nipa owo.
He will always be human with an idea.	Oun yoo jẹ eniyan nigbagbogbo pẹlu ero kan.
I don’t want to look like that.	Emi ko fẹ lati dabi iyẹn.
I know it is not.	Mo mọ pe kii ṣe.
This is easy to do in a box.	Eyi rọrun lati ṣe ninu apoti kan.
That’s almost as much as anyone can get out of it.	Iyẹn fẹrẹ to bi ẹnikẹni ṣe le jade ninu rẹ.
Promise me you will not grow too fast.	Ṣe ileri fun mi pe iwọ kii yoo yara dagba ju.
Here are some of our favorites.	Eyi jẹ diẹ ninu awọn ayanfẹ wa.
He sat of them all.	O joko ti gbogbo wọn.
One after another.	Ọkan lẹhin ti miiran.
But what you know now is enough.	Ṣugbọn ohun ti o mọ ni bayi ti to.
I fully understand.	Mo loye patapata.
I love this plane.	Mo nifẹ ọkọ ofurufu yii.
It has spread to big worlds.	O ti fa si awọn aye nla.
Apparently they were on a school trip.	O han ni wọn wa lori irin-ajo ile-iwe kan.
We believe someone picked it up by mistake.	A gbagbọ pe ẹnikan gbe e nipasẹ aṣiṣe.
I think he will come back.	Mo ro pe o yoo pada.
And remember, there are many people who believe in it.	Ati ranti, ọpọlọpọ eniyan lo wa ti wọn gbagbọ ninu rẹ.
This needs to end here.	Eyi nilo lati pari nibi.
He did not want to tell his parents.	Ko fe so fun awon obi re.
I want you to be happy and you seem to be happy here.	Mo fẹ ki inu rẹ dun ati pe o dabi ẹni pe o dun nibi.
They did not speak at all because they feared him.	Wọn sọrọ rara nitori wọn bẹru rẹ.
She was afraid of the coming test.	O bẹru nipa idanwo ti n bọ.
But they could not help each other.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko le ran ara wọn lọwọ.
By car, it takes a few hours.	Nipa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ, o gba awọn wakati diẹ.
It will be good for you.	Yoo dara fun o.
I hope it works out.	Mo nireti pe o ṣiṣẹ jade.
This has already been tried.	Eyi ti gbiyanju tẹlẹ.
Enjoy it when you can, when you are young.	Gbadun rẹ nigba ti o le, nigba ti o ba wa ni ọdọ.
I look forward to getting into it.	Mo n reti lati di sinu rẹ.
I knew he was afraid of me.	Mo mọ pe o bẹru mi.
Tell me.	Sọ fun mi.
It takes a lot of information into that kind of space.	O gba alaye pupọ pupọ sinu iru aaye yẹn.
Interesting, very interesting.	Awon, gan awon.
But you will never know.	Ṣugbọn iwọ kii yoo mọ.
I have two of them.	Mo ni meji ninu wọn.
I look here the other day.	Mo wo ibi ni ọjọ miiran.
I made the words.	Mo ṣe awọn ọrọ naa.
I called my mother and we talked about it.	Mo pe iya mi ati pe a sọrọ nipa rẹ.
The girls knew that and were afraid it would go against them.	Awọn ọmọbirin mọ pe ati bẹru pe yoo lo si wọn.
I'm not serious.	Emi ko ni gaan.
They have to do.	Wọn ni lati ṣe.
He asked a lot of questions at that time.	O beere ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere ni akoko yẹn.
Hard time, really.	Akoko lile, ni otitọ.
It just can't seem to.	O kan ko le dabi lati.
It's full of money.	O kun fun owo.
I hope it starts.	Mo nireti pe o bẹrẹ.
At least a little, but always a lot.	O kere ju diẹ, ṣugbọn nigbagbogbo pupọ pupọ.
They have a daughter.	Wọn ni ọmọbirin kan.
Nothing but this.	Nkankan sugbon yi.
There is so much to do.	Ọpọlọpọ wa lati ṣe.
It is in it.	O wa ninu rẹ.
Maybe you do.	Boya o ṣe.
You can’t help everyone.	O ko le ran gbogbo eniyan lọwọ.
That's what you need more of.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti o nilo diẹ sii ti.
I can see he was scared.	Mo le rii pe o bẹru.
Now do not want to open.	Bayi ko fẹ lati ṣii.
Nothing and everything.	Ko si nkankan ati ohun gbogbo.
That's less than an hour.	Iyẹn kere ju wakati kan lọ.
They just sound pretty good that day.	Wọn kan dun dara julọ ni ọjọ yẹn.
Let everyone know your name.	Jẹ ki gbogbo eniyan mọ orukọ rẹ.
Live well, that is.	Gbe to dara, iyẹn.
He took my books.	O si mu mi awọn iwe.
It is a place to write and receive letters.	O jẹ aaye lati kọ ati gba awọn lẹta.
My body has not stopped me.	Ara mi ko ti da mi.
I think we can be better.	Mo ro pe a le dara julọ.
Today it looks like rain.	Loni o dabi ojo.
Surprisingly, it worked.	Iyalẹnu, o ṣiṣẹ.
He doesn’t like to know right now.	Ko fẹran lati mọ ni bayi.
You are there, and so on.	Iwọ wa nibẹ, ati bẹ naa.
This is not surprising.	Eyi kii ṣe iyalẹnu.
They seemed to understand.	O dabi enipe wọn loye.
These drinks are not good for families.	Awọn ohun mimu wọnyi ko dara fun awọn idile.
The end result is uncertain.	Ipari ipari ko ni idaniloju.
I love a lot of things.	Mo nifẹ ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
You just need to look up.	O kan nilo lati wo soke.
The only question is when and how.	Awọn ibeere nikan ni nigba ati bawo ni.
I met him at his house.	Mo pade rẹ ni ile rẹ.
About the same as returning home.	Nipa kanna bi pada si ile.
It's just not good.	O kan ko dara.
There is a man here.	Ọkunrin kan wa nibi.
With this alone we have no intention.	Pẹlu eyi nikan ni a ni aniyan eyikeyi.
You can only delete it now.	Nikan o le pa a ni bayi.
He doesn’t seem to think it’s good.	Ko dabi ẹni pe o ro pe o dara.
But that’s all I’m talking about.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn nikan ni mo n sọrọ.
I’m talking to a football.	Mo n sọrọ si bọọlu kan.
Nothing seemed to happen.	Ko si ohun dabi enipe lati ṣẹlẹ.
And he did not.	Ati pe ko ṣe bẹ.
But it's simple.	Ṣugbọn o rọrun.
But there is a problem.	Ṣugbọn iṣoro kan wa.
The truth is that it is gone.	Otitọ ni pe o ti lọ.
There is no place like home.	Ko si aaye bi ile.
Help you get dressed on the first day.	Ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ lati wọ aṣọ ni ọjọ akọkọ.
We will need more room in the attic.	A yoo nilo yara diẹ sii ni oke aja.
We may have died before they even noticed he was gone.	A le ti ku ṣaaju ki wọn paapaa ṣe akiyesi pe o ti lọ.
You should only cut it.	O yẹ ki o ge rẹ nikan.
Just think it is.	O kan ro pe o jẹ.
Winter stays on for a while.	Igba otutu duro lori fun igba diẹ.
Out on top.	Jade lori oke.
It also grows physically.	O tun n dagba ni ti ara.
No one seems to have a bad word to say about it.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o dabi ẹni pe o ni ọrọ buburu lati sọ nipa rẹ.
I saw your picture.	Mo ti ri aworan rẹ.
I can walk.	Mo le rin.
We don’t even have to wait.	A ko paapaa ni lati duro.
I don’t want to look back at that.	Emi ko fẹ lati wo pada si iyẹn.
You don’t get there after the fact.	O ko gba nibẹ lẹhin ti o daju.
Now you hear here, this is the last world.	Bayi o gbọ nibi, eyi ni aye ti o kẹhin.
Much work remains to be done.	Pupọ iṣẹ ni o ku lati ṣe.
I was born for this.	A bi mi fun eyi.
I do not remember.	Emi ko ranti.
But it may not be for everyone.	Ṣugbọn o le ma jẹ fun gbogbo eniyan.
But it will take longer than that.	Ṣugbọn yoo gba to gun ju iyẹn lọ.
Make sure you do not sell water.	Rii daju pe o ko ta omi.
I burned something.	Mo sun nkankan.
I would have to say no.	Emi yoo ni lati sọ rara.
I can't find a job because of this.	Emi ko ri iṣẹ kan nitori eyi.
However, it is not a question at hand.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe ibeere ni ọwọ.
At that time he was not there.	Ni akoko yẹn ko si nibẹ.
I was the last person they wanted around.	Emi ni ẹni ikẹhin ti wọn fẹ ni ayika.
You have to go outside.	O ni lati jade ni ita.
Not your problem.	Kii ṣe iṣoro rẹ.
Go to your room.	Lọ si yara rẹ.
What time is it?	Kini akoko naa?
By the time they moved, he was already young.	Ni akoko ti wọn gbe lọ, o ti di ọmọde.
It can be written down.	O le wa ni kọ silẹ.
He loves our city and our people.	O nifẹ ilu wa ati awọn eniyan wa.
And go.	Ati ki o lọ.
I do not really expect this great work.	Emi ko nireti iṣẹ nla yii gaan.
He spent several days finding his way home.	O lo awọn ọjọ pupọ lati wa ọna rẹ si ile.
Don't think of anything.	Maṣe ro ohunkohun.
So you have to be a member yourself.	Nitorina o gbọdọ jẹ ọmọ ẹgbẹ funrararẹ.
It doesn’t seem like you need to say.	Ko dabi pe o nilo lati sọ.
I sometimes cook with him.	Mo maa n se ounjẹ pẹlu rẹ nigba miiran.
This house has a large garden.	Ile yii ni ọgba nla kan.
To and from the physical world.	Lati ati jade ti aye ara.
We are not there.	A ko wa nibẹ.
However, this approach has its drawbacks.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọna yii ni awọn iṣoro.
She laughed at that.	O rẹrin ni iyẹn.
In this case it is a good thing.	Ni idi eyi o jẹ ohun ti o dara.
There is this love.	Ife yi wa.
I love seeing them out there.	Mo fẹran ri wọn jade nibẹ.
No hands up.	Ko si ọwọ kan soke.
It will happen in your own way.	Yoo ṣẹlẹ ni ọna tirẹ.
Work is a job, and money is money.	Iṣẹ jẹ iṣẹ kan, ati pe owo jẹ owo.
Okay start planning your outfit soon.	Dara bẹrẹ lati gbero aṣọ rẹ laipẹ.
Her eyes thought about the room.	Oju rẹ ro nipa yara naa.
But there is something important here.	Ṣugbọn nkan pataki kan wa nibi.
I want to reach out and take life.	Mo fẹ lati de ọdọ ati gba igbesi aye.
He will use His power over everyone.	Oun yoo lo agbara rẹ si gbogbo eniyan.
When was the last time you saw me?	Nigbawo ni igba ikẹhin ti o ri mi?
There is nothing for you to worry about.	Ko si nkankan fun ọ lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
And soon he too died.	Ati laipẹ oun naa ti ku.
I am not alone.	Emi nikan ko.
They did not buy the house.	Wọn ko ra ile naa.
It doesn’t seem to have to be done every day.	Ko dabi pe o ni lati ṣe ni gbogbo ọjọ.
One in front of you and one behind.	Ọkan ni iwaju rẹ ati ọkan lẹhin.
You “go out to lunch” about that.	O “jade lọ si ounjẹ ọsan” nipa eyi.
People lose their jobs.	Eniyan padanu ise won.
I must have missed something.	Mo ti gbọdọ ti padanu nkankan.
They know what they are and what they are about.	Wọn mọ ohun ti wọn jẹ ati ohun ti wọn jẹ nipa.
He was not there for the time being.	Ko si nibẹ fun akoko naa.
No, just.	Rara, o kan.
Their words are incomprehensible.	Ọrọ wọn ko ni oye.
He also called.	O tun pe.
We do not say anything, because we do not need to.	A ko sọ nkankan, nitori a ko nilo lati.
In because.	Ninu nitori.
That alone is my best team from now on.	Iyẹn nikan ni ẹgbẹ mi ti o dara julọ yoo wa lati igba yii lọ.
I do not own yours.	Emi ko ni tirẹ.
Dad, just give me two minutes.	Baba, o kan fun mi ni iṣẹju meji.
To establish.	Lati fi idi .
I should be down there.	Mo yẹ ki o wa ni isalẹ nibẹ.
He said it meant nothing.	O sọ pe ko tumọ si nkankan.
I never left my child with anyone.	Emi ko fi ọmọ mi silẹ pẹlu ẹnikẹni.
I have to buy one for myself as well.	Mo ni lati ra ọkan fun ara mi pẹlu.
It is possible.	O ṣee ṣe.
You probably do not have time to leave.	O jasi ko ni akoko lati lọ kuro.
The box is simple.	Apoti jẹ rọrun.
He placed both hands on me.	O gbe ọwọ mejeeji si mi.
Where to start.	Ibi ti o bẹrẹ.
She longs to see you again.	O fẹ pupọ lati ri ọ lẹẹkansi.
You just need to do it.	O kan nilo lati ṣe.
We do not.	A ko ṣe.
We hope this does not happen again.	A nireti pe eyi ko tun ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
I feel really good about those things.	Mo lero gan ti o dara nipa awon ohun.
Out of time.	Jade ti akoko.
You heard a great word.	O gbọ ọrọ nla kan.
I can well remember.	Mo le ranti daradara.
Lack of.	Ko ni.
There is nothing like it, before or after.	Ko si ohun ti o dabi rẹ, ṣaaju tabi lẹhin.
It is not too late to do.	Ko pẹ lati ṣe.
But it will.	Ṣugbọn yoo.
His eyes widened.	Oju rẹ duro.
You have made her as bad as yourself.	O ti ṣe rẹ bi buburu bi ara rẹ.
It works this way.	O ṣiṣẹ ọna yi.
Just leave.	O kan lọ kuro.
Can you help me with this?	Ṣe o le fun mi ni ọwọ pẹlu eyi?
Nothing, and no.	Ko si nkankan, ati rara.
You want to sleep.	O fẹ lati sun.
I was in the big room, on the couch.	Mo wa ninu yara nla, lori ijoko.
People kill for love.	Eniyan pa fun ife.
There was so much.	Nibẹ wà ki Elo.
But just think about it.	Sugbon o kan ro nipa ti o.
I do not want to be.	Emi ko fẹ pe emi ni.
Let's just treat it.	Jẹ ki a kan tọju rẹ.
Do you already have this idea?	Njẹ o ti ni imọran yii tẹlẹ?
I do not belong to anyone.	Emi ko je ti enikeni.
Of course, most people know that already.	Dajudaju, ọpọlọpọ eniyan mọ pe tẹlẹ.
Everyone should do their best to leave.	Gbogbo eniyan yẹ ki o ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ lati lọ kuro.
Nothing personal, but the first time it happened to me.	Ko si nkan ti ara ẹni, ṣugbọn igba akọkọ ti o ṣẹlẹ si mi.
The rain stopped.	Ojo ti duro.
Place it on the table.	Gbe o lori tabili.
He lives in them now.	O ngbe inu wọn ni bayi.
Please do not be angry.	Jọwọ maṣe binu.
All you can do is just be there.	Gbogbo ohun ti o le ṣe ni o kan wa nibẹ.
The city has some big problems.	Ilu naa ni awọn iṣoro nla diẹ.
They know it.	Wọn mọ ọ.
Is all known.	Ti wa ni gbogbo mọ.
If you like your ending, you should stick with it.	Ti o ba fẹran ipari rẹ, o yẹ ki o duro pẹlu rẹ.
The door is not locked.	A ko tii tii ilẹkun ilẹkun.
There was so much to see.	Nibẹ wà ki Elo lati ri.
I turned to the side.	Mo yipada si ẹgbẹ naa.
Not me, everyone else wants me to be.	Kii ṣe emi naa, gbogbo eniyan miiran fẹ ki n jẹ.
'the past.	' ti o ti kọja.
Even the back roads are full.	Paapaa awọn opopona ẹhin ti kun.
Don't miss it.	Maṣe padanu rẹ.
Not yet, it will be a week.	Ko sibẹsibẹ, o yoo jẹ ọsẹ kan.
We will return to this point in due course.	A yoo pada si aaye yii ni akoko ti o to.
You could have waited for nothing.	O le ti duro fun ohunkohun.
That expects a reward today.	Iyẹn n reti ere loni.
O le ma jade.	O le ma jade.
I have to leave.	Mo ni lati lọ kuro.
Three of these stand out.	Mẹta ti awọn wọnyi duro jade.
It went well as you would have hoped.	O lọ daradara bi iwọ yoo ti nireti.
We go out all the time.	A jade lọ ni gbogbo igba.
If anything has happened to you, please let me know.	Ti ohunkohun ba ti ṣẹlẹ si ọ, jọwọ jẹ ki mi mọ.
People take advantage.	Eniyan lo anfani.
Or think you do.	Tabi ro pe o ṣe.
Don’t forget that you love it.	Maṣe gbagbe pe o nifẹ rẹ.
No problem, we are happy to do.	Ko si iṣoro, inu wa dun lati ṣe.
Or on it.	Tabi lori rẹ.
Such boats can cost a lot of money.	Iru awọn ọkọ oju omi bẹẹ le gba iye nla.
This is the first.	Eyi jẹ akọkọ.
I'll go the other way.	Emi yoo lọ si ọna miiran.
All right do what they have to do.	Gbogbo awọn ti o tọ ṣe ohun ti wọn yẹ lati ṣe.
He did not do 'dad' things with her, he tried to kill her.	Ko ṣe awọn nkan 'baba' pẹlu rẹ, o gbiyanju lati pa a.
Everyone should try to do their best.	Gbogbo eniyan yẹ ki o gbiyanju lati ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
And of course he did, when he met her.	Ati pe dajudaju o ṣe, nigbati o pade rẹ.
In many cases they are wrong.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba wọn jẹ aṣiṣe.
Pull back.	Fa pada.
To something.	Si nkan kan.
She looked back at him.	O wo pada si i.
Okay, he said.	O dara, o sọ.
I can find myself wearing this on my wedding day.	Mo ti le ri ara mi wọ yi lori mi igbeyawo ọjọ.
And that’s something that can’t be.	Ati pe nkan ti ko le jẹ.
Parents ask if their child can sit in it.	Awọn obi beere boya ọmọ wọn le joko ninu rẹ.
Just three weeks to wait.	O kan ọsẹ mẹta lati duro.
I am taking people from outside the city.	Mo n gba eniyan lati ita ilu.
What are you doing tonight?	Kini o n ṣe ni alẹ oni?
That alone doesn’t matter.	Iyẹn nikan ko ṣe pataki.
They might love it.	Wọn le nifẹ rẹ.
He asked questions.	O beere fun awọn ibeere.
The road was closed at this time.	Opopona ti a pa ni akoko yii.
But it is not one with true power.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọkan pẹlu agbara otitọ.
She loves it so much.	O nifẹ pupọ nipa rẹ.
I want you to let me go now.	Mo fẹ pe o jẹ ki n lọ ni bayi.
This is what keeps us going.	Eyi ni ohun ti o jẹ ki a tẹsiwaju.
His father is in his own world.	Baba rẹ wa ni aye ti ara rẹ.
Not completely.	Ko ni patapata.
That means you are on the right track.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe o wa lori ọna ti o tọ.
Any minute now, and he will be in the room with us.	Eyikeyi iṣẹju ni bayi, ati pe oun yoo wa ninu yara pẹlu wa.
They did not give him any money.	Wọn ko fun u ni owo kankan.
Okay, of course it is.	O dara, dajudaju o jẹ.
That's what you think.	Ohun ti o ro niyẹn.
It is week to week.	O jẹ ọsẹ si ọsẹ.
This is only one group.	Eyi jẹ ẹgbẹ kan nikan.
We don’t even have to think about it.	A ko paapaa ni lati ronu nipa rẹ.
We might as well see it now.	A le bi daradara wo ni bayi.
I'm on high here.	Mo wa lori giga nibi.
I think I still have to work on the situation.	Mo ro pe Mo tun ni lati ṣiṣẹ lori ipo.
Time to return to life.	Akoko lati pada si aye.
He did not spend all that time talking to me.	O ko lo gbogbo akoko yẹn lati ba mi sọrọ.
I get down the road.	Mo gba si isalẹ awọn ọna.
It's great.	O dara julọ.
They go to work.	Wọn lọ si iṣẹ.
The problem is our own.	Iṣoro naa jẹ ti ara wa.
That is them.	Iyẹn ni wọn.
Everything will have its time when it arrives.	Ohun gbogbo yoo ni akoko rẹ nigbati o ba de.
It was the first time he used his first name.	O jẹ igba akọkọ ti o lo orukọ akọkọ rẹ.
We will see him.	A yoo ri i.
Make sure you have the right tools for the job.	Rii daju pe o ni ohun elo to tọ fun iṣẹ naa.
It is the only train you can give.	O jẹ ọkọ oju irin nikan ti o le fun.
The translation has been removed.	A ti yọ tumọ naa kuro patapata.
I never knew my mother, you see.	Emi ko mọ iya mi rara, o rii.
I have been waiting for you to come.	Mo ti n duro de e lati wa.
I wonder if you will grow up like them.	Mo Iyanu boya o yoo dagba soke bi wọn.
With a lot of people that is true as well.	Pẹlu ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan ti o jẹ otitọ bi daradara.
I doubt if they will come back again.	Mo ṣiyemeji boya wọn yoo pada wa lẹẹkansi.
I am not worried about it.	Emi ko ni aniyan nipa rẹ.
I have heard about this.	Mo ti gbọ nipa eyi.
This drink tastes good.	Ohun mimu yi dun.
It opens up most of your life.	O ṣii ọpọlọpọ igbesi aye rẹ.
And write many other things.	Ati kọ ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan miiran.
Last year, we were angry.	Ni ọdun to kọja, a binu.
That will take up a lot more room than here.	Iyẹn yoo gba yara pupọ diẹ sii ju ti o wa nibi.
Because it was just a.	Nitori ti o je kan a.
What they do.	Ohun ti wọn ṣe.
I need everyone to leave this area right now.	Mo nilo gbogbo eniyan lati kuro ni agbegbe yii ni bayi.
Travel may be required.	Irin-ajo le nilo.
Such a good book.	Iru iwe to dara bẹẹ.
My question is here and now.	Ibeere mi nibi ati bayi ni.
In the same year.	Ni odun kanna.
Maybe you want to photograph after that, or maybe not.	Boya o fẹ ṣe aworan lẹhin iyẹn, tabi boya kii ṣe.
I have to let it go.	Mo ni ki o je ki n lo.
I can't find a way to work out.	Emi ko le wa ọna lati ṣiṣẹ jade.
Cannot read and understand games.	Ko le ka ati loye awọn ere.
You want to insert it for another.	O fẹ fi sii fun miiran.
You do not get.	O ko gba.
This requires careful consideration.	Eyi nilo lati lo akiyesi.
I need to find out why they are happening.	Mo nilo lati wa idi ti wọn fi n ṣẹlẹ.
There are several cars around the building.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ pupọ wa ni ayika ile naa.
The company would not continue without them.	Ile-iṣẹ naa kii yoo tẹsiwaju laisi wọn.
On the same day.	Ni ọjọ kanna.
I want that for you.	Mo fẹ iyẹn fun ọ.
You should spend more time in running.	O yẹ ki o lo akoko diẹ sii ni ṣiṣe.
She did very well.	O ṣe daradara pupọ.
You can go now, if you want.	O le lọ ni bayi, ti o ba fẹ.
Where we are going is not even an idea.	Ibi ti a yoo lọ ko paapaa ero kan.
The house is beautiful.	Ile naa lẹwa.
Remember, please.	Jọwọ, ranti.
So it was a small gift.	Nitorina o jẹ ẹbun kekere kan.
His face could not be seen.	A ko le ri oju rẹ.
I know what this looks like, but.	Mo mọ kini eyi dabi, ṣugbọn.
I do not go out to eat, drink, or anything else.	Emi ko jade lati jẹ, mu, tabi ohunkohun miiran.
Things to be around girls.	Awọn nkan lati wa ni ayika awọn ọmọbirin.
I can't even try it.	Emi ko le gbiyanju rẹ paapaa.
Promise me they will come back one day and take me home.	Ṣe ileri fun mi pe wọn yoo pada wa ni ọjọ kan ati mu mi lọ si ile.
Not so.	Kii ṣe iru bẹ.

I really do.	Mo ṣe gaan.
And everyone knows this.	Ati gbogbo eniyan mọ eyi.
But that is not what this question is about.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti ibeere yii jẹ nipa.
And the stories he told me about his mother.	Ati awọn itan ti o sọ fun mi nipa iya rẹ.
I want to know who it is.	Mo fẹ lati mọ ẹniti o ṣe.
After a night of mistakes, you have to leave.	Lẹhin alẹ ti awọn aṣiṣe, o ni lati lọ kuro.
He stole everyone's money.	O ji owo gbogbo eniyan.
You must know that feeling like a police officer.	O gbọdọ mọ rilara yẹn bi ọlọpa.
But that never happened.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣe rara.
His friends decided to get a job for him.	Awọn ọrẹ rẹ pinnu lati gba iṣẹ kan fun u.
We do not know what you need to do to get the job done.	A ko mọ ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe iṣẹ naa.
Look at my face.	Wo oju mi.
Which tells me two things.	Eyi ti o sọ ohun meji fun mi.
And that is completely as it should be.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ patapata bi o ti yẹ ki o jẹ.
This makes me very sad.	Eyi n dun mi pupọ.

He would have liked that.	Oun yoo ti fẹran iyẹn.
He is behind.	O wa lẹhin.
Those who may be able to use more.	Awọn ti o le ni anfani lati lo diẹ sii.
Both her parents.	Awon obi re mejeeji.

I have heard this song before.	Mo ti gbọ orin yi tẹlẹ.
A long time ago.	Igba pipẹ ti o ti kọja.
But probably not.	Sugbon jasi ko.
The only reason he didn't die was the dog.	Idi nikan ti ko ku ni aja naa.
And he laid his hands on her.	O si gbe ọwọ rẹ lori rẹ.
You should go to a doctor.	O yẹ ki o lọ si ọdọ dokita kan.
Do one thing at a time.	Ṣe ohun kan ni akoko kan.
There is nothing to lose.	Ko si nkankan lati padanu.
We will go after every football.	A yoo lọ lẹhin gbogbo bọọlu.
It is good to send a new face.	O dara lati fi oju tuntun ranṣẹ.
You deserve to pull them out.	O yẹ lati fa wọn jade.
He is watching.	O n wo.
He fears the players will kill him.	O bẹru awọn ẹrọ orin yoo pa a.
Get even tomorrow.	Gba ọla paapaa.
I just did my job.	Mo kan ṣe iṣẹ mi.
They have nothing to go on.	Wọn ko ni nkankan lati lọ lori.
Anyone with any interest in the story will enjoy it.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ni anfani eyikeyi ninu itan yoo gbadun rẹ.
The price has risen in the last few years.	Iye owo naa ti dide ni awọn ọdun diẹ sẹhin.
It was a great deal.	O jẹ adehun nla.
Even children can not sit still.	Paapaa awọn ọmọde ko le joko jẹ.
This is a minute.	Eyi jẹ iṣẹju kan.
I have no idea what might be the problem.	Emi ko ni imọran kini o le jẹ iṣoro naa.
At least they would have had a lot to think about.	Bi o kere julọ wọn yoo ti ni ọpọlọpọ lati ronu.
I use tea.	Mo lo ninu tii.
I have never been so out of my life.	Mo ti a ti ko ki jade ninu aye mi.
He never wrote an application.	Ko kọ ohun elo rara.
I'm sure you will do well !.	Mo daju pe iwọ yoo ṣe daradara!.
He does not need my help.	Ko nilo iranlọwọ mi.
He will wait for a while and then he will come back.	Oun yoo duro fun igba diẹ ki o pada sẹhin.
He borrowed some money from his friend.	O ya owo diẹ lọwọ ọrẹ rẹ.
It may take some time to stop.	O le wa akoko diẹ lati da.
Two weeks have passed.	Ọsẹ meji ti kọja.
I think it's gone.	Mo ro pe o ti lọ.
There is not much to look at.	Ko si nkankan pupọ lati wo.
If this thing goes to the test.	Ti nkan yii ba lọ si idanwo.
Things are starting to make a lot of sense.	Awọn nkan bẹrẹ lati ni oye pupọ.
Or a boat.	Tabi ọkọ oju omi.
It seems to work well for the time being.	O dabi pe o ṣiṣẹ daradara fun akoko naa.
They do so only at night.	Wọn ṣe bẹ nikan ni alẹ.
It is not possible.	Ko le ṣee ṣe.
However, they are not material.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn kii ṣe ohun elo.
We just need to talk in person.	A kan nilo lati sọrọ ni eniyan.

My car does things that sell.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi ṣe awọn ohun ti n ta.
This is something more.	Eyi jẹ nkan diẹ sii.
Don’t waste time and money to catch the wrong person.	Maṣe padanu akoko ati owo lati mu eniyan ti ko tọ.
I have an idea.	Mo ni imọran.
I will not let my children.	Emi yoo ko jẹ ki awọn ọmọ mi.
The name of the day, you know.	Orukọ ọjọ naa, o mọ.
The most important thing right now is to let them eat again.	Ohun pataki julọ ni bayi ni lati jẹ ki wọn jẹun lẹẹkansi.
We walked across it and sat down.	A rin kọja rẹ a si joko.
This is my brother.	Eyi ni arakunrin mi.
Everyone is looking at me.	Gbogbo eniyan n wo mi.
Read the following statements.	Ka awọn ọrọ wọnyi.
Pick it up if you have to.	Gbe e ti o ba ni lati.
The children were so no one could see.	Awọn ọmọ wà ki ko si ọkan le ri.

The thing itself.	Ohun naa funrararẹ.
Eat a cup of tea.	Je ife tii kan.

Not very good.	Ko dara pupọ.
Now, on why you are here.	Bayi, lori idi ti o fi wa nibi.
It's not very fast.	O ko yara pupọ.

He did it to this hour.	O ṣe si wakati yii.
Very drop but one placed in your hair.	Pupọ ju silẹ ṣugbọn ọkan ti o gbe sinu irun ori rẹ.
They will never know how they feel.	Wọn kii yoo mọ bi wọn ṣe lero mọ.
There was nothing for me to see.	Ko si nkankan fun mi lati ri.
Once upon a time in my book.	Igba kan to ninu iwe mi.
She was there with me the day my mother left.	O wa nibẹ pẹlu mi ni ọjọ ti iya mi lọ.
He brought the money.	O mu owo naa wa.
These moments call for something more.	Awọn akoko wọnyi pe fun nkan diẹ sii.
For your time.	Fun akoko rẹ.
Run the program.	Ṣiṣẹ eto naa.
They will have to make sure that they mean what they say.	Wọn yoo ni lati ni idaniloju pe wọn tumọ si ohun ti wọn sọ.
I need not talk too much.	Mo nilo lati ko sọrọ pupọ.
This may not be possible.	Eyi le ma ṣee ṣe.

So, have something to eat and drink.	Nitorina, ni nkan lati jẹ ati mu.
Not always.	Ko ṣe ni gbogbo igba.
But I do not know how it works.	Ṣugbọn Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe le ṣiṣẹ.
None of this is wrong.	Ko si eyi ti o jẹ aṣiṣe.
Go your own way, do your own thing.	Tẹsiwaju lọ si ọna tirẹ, ṣe ohun tirẹ.
This is something that has been in the works for a while.	Eyi jẹ nkan ti o wa ninu iṣẹ fun igba diẹ.
Again, this is your decision.	Lẹẹkansi, eyi ni ipinnu rẹ.
And it is in my life today.	Ati pe o wa ninu igbesi aye mi loni.
Children in public schools are even more privileged.	Awọn ọmọde ni awọn ile-iwe ti gbogbo eniyan ni anfani paapaa.

The dogs we have will run.	Awọn aja ti a ni yoo sare.
I just want to pull on the device and go.	Mo kan fẹ lati fa lori ẹrọ ki o lọ.
I don’t think you’ll see a lot of what they say they do.	Emi ko ro pe iwọ yoo rii ọpọlọpọ ti wọn sọ pe wọn ṣe.
That even goes to the music industry well.	Iyẹn paapaa lọ si ile-iṣẹ orin daradara.
But it can’t last, of course.	Ṣugbọn ko le ṣiṣe ni, dajudaju.
We build ourselves.	A kọ ara wa.

If you lose you lose.	Ti o ba padanu o padanu.
They will learn a lot of the idea.	Wọn yoo kọ ẹkọ pupọ julọ ti ero naa.

But it’s not all as simple as it could be.	Ṣugbọn gbogbo rẹ ko rọrun bi o ti le jẹ.
They will do what they want.	Wọn yoo ṣe ohun ti wọn fẹ.
I can not wait.	Nko le duro mo.
I wish the book would tell you this.	Mo fẹ pe iwe naa yoo sọ eyi fun ọ.
The kind of person he is.	Iru eniyan ti o jẹ.
It was time to listen to the last verse.	O de ni akoko lati gbọ ẹsẹ ti o kẹhin.
I do not know how.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe le.
It doesn't matter who they are.	Ko ṣe pataki ti wọn jẹ.

Do you want to help with dinner?	Ṣe o fẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ pẹlu ounjẹ alẹ?
However, one must try.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọkan gbọdọ gbiyanju.
It helped me learn.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi lati kọ ẹkọ.
I am a member of this group.	Mo jẹ ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti ẹgbẹ yii.
Whatever you have, you have.	Ohunkohun ti o ni, o ni.
There was no fire in the house.	Ko si ina kankan ninu ile naa.
See how far we have come.	Wo bi a ti ti de to.
It does not kill you.	Ko pa ọ.
I don't like this.	Emi ko fẹ eyi.
You do not want to leave.	O ko fẹ lati lọ kuro.
They know they need to store water.	Wọn mọ pe wọn nilo lati tọju omi.
All at the same time.	Gbogbo ni akoko kanna.
Your hairstyle has changed a lot over the years.	Ọna irun ori rẹ ti yipada pupọ ni awọn ọdun.

Enjoy yourself I'll be there before long.	Gbadun ara rẹ Emi yoo wa nibẹ ṣaaju pipẹ.
It is not possible to walk around the city on foot.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati rin ni ayika ilu ni ẹsẹ.
But it also has another advantage.	Ṣugbọn o tun ni anfani miiran.
There must be something they cannot accept.	Ohun kan gbọdọ wa ti wọn ko le gba.

Good family time.	O dara akoko ebi.
It was interesting to see how the holidays changed.	O jẹ ohun ti o dun lati rii bi awọn isinmi ṣe yipada.
He is happy.	Inu re dun.
When he stopped the car, the thoughts came out.	Nigbati o duro ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ, awọn ero ti jade.
The device is easy to use.	Ẹrọ naa rọrun lati lo.
I hope you find things that stop you.	Mo nireti pe o rii awọn nkan ti o da ọ duro.
One person should not perform all planning tasks.	Eniyan kan ko yẹ ki o ṣe gbogbo awọn iṣẹ ṣiṣe eto.
Sure you haven't read this.	O daju pe ko ti ka eyi.
But it would be nice for me to go.	Ṣugbọn yoo dara fun mi lati lọ.
Which you do not give.	Eyi ti o ko fun.
I think the reason he gave it.	Mo ro pe idi ti o fi fun ni.
They all raised their heads.	Gbogbo won gbe ori won soke.
But he has left it to you.	Ṣugbọn o ti fi silẹ fun ọ.
On all sides.	Lori gbogbo awọn ẹgbẹ.
They decided to get the least back.	Wọn pinnu lati gba awọn ti o kere julọ pada.
It seems to be working for us.	O dabi pe o n ṣiṣẹ fun wa.
You can find anything there.	O le wa ohunkohun nibẹ.
It makes a certain amount of sense.	O ṣe kan awọn iye ti ori.
It is a difficult place to build.	O jẹ aaye ti o nira lati kọ.
Don't let it be.	Maṣe jẹ ki o jẹ.
Now let's get under.	Bayi jẹ ki ká gba labẹ.
There are problems with this method, however.	Awọn iṣoro wa pẹlu ọna yii, sibẹsibẹ.
And so it was.	Ati ki o wà.
But there is no harm in writing it out.	Ṣugbọn ko si ipalara lati kọ ọ jade.
There are a lot of things that happen that way.	Awọn nkan pupọ wa ti o ṣẹlẹ ni ọna yẹn.
But this also leaves us with a problem.	Ṣugbọn eyi tun fi wa silẹ pẹlu iṣoro kan.
Didn't find anything.	Ko ri nkankan.
It didn’t make a big deal at all.	Ko ṣe adehun nla kan rara.
It has been a really good way to think.	O ti jẹ ọna ti o dara gaan lati ronu.
Okay, you can always try.	O dara, o le gbiyanju nigbagbogbo.
It doesn’t benefit me more than it does.	Ko ni anfani fun mi ju ti o ti ṣe lọ.
I don’t stand for them.	Emi ko duro fun wọn.
Don't think, just do.	Ko ronu, o kan ṣe.
It seems more.	O dabi diẹ sii.
You need to think your mind.	O nilo lati ro ero rẹ.
Our team visited several schools last year.	Ẹgbẹ wa ṣabẹwo si ọpọlọpọ awọn ile-iwe ni ọdun to kọja.
Repeat this twice from bottom to top.	Tun eyi ṣe ni igba meji lati isalẹ si oke.
My husband always goes on trips.	Ọkọ mi nigbagbogbo ma lọ si irin-ajo.
I just want attention.	Mo kan fẹ akiyesi.
It's over.	O ti kọja rẹ.
I said that.	Mo ti so wipe.
None of these now.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn bayi.
The weather changed a lot during this year.	Oju ojo yipada pupọ ni akoko ọdun yii.
I will make sure that my people there keep him active for a while.	Emi yoo rii daju pe awọn eniyan mi nibẹ mu u ṣiṣẹ lọwọ fun igba diẹ.
Go into the river when you have to!	Lọ sinu odo nigbati o ni lati!
There is so much better in it than anything else.	O dara pupọ wa ninu rẹ ju ohunkohun miiran lọ.
But, it would be nice to get a little more information.	Ṣugbọn, yoo dara lati gba alaye diẹ diẹ sii.
I pull up in front.	Mo fa soke ni iwaju.
This took him completely by surprise.	Eyi mu u patapata nipa iyalẹnu.
Sleep here for as long as you want.	Sun nibi fun igba ti o ba fẹ.
People think you want to.	Awọn eniyan ro pe o fẹ.
She has no desire to experiment with another man.	Ko ni ifẹ lati ṣe idanwo pẹlu ọkunrin miiran.
You think you know what you want.	O ro pe o mọ ohun ti o fẹ.
What more could you want ?.	Kini diẹ sii ti o le fẹ?.
Like yesterday.	Bi ni lana.
And it can happen now.	Ati pe o le ṣẹlẹ ni bayi.
I know what it is, but that does not matter.	Mo mọ kini o jẹ, ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣe pataki.
It is impossible to lose.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati padanu.
That was my first home.	Iyẹn ni ile akọkọ mi.
You will think you have more to worry about.	Iwọ yoo ro pe o ni diẹ lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
This is your chance to pay back.	Eyi ni anfani rẹ lati san pada.
I do not apply.	Emi ko kan.
The sister could not stand the heat.	Arabinrin naa ko le duro lori ooru.
I know what's going on.	Mo mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
He spoke with determination.	O sọrọ pẹlu ipinnu.
This is amazing.	Eyi jẹ iyanu.
It surprised me.	O mu mi iyalẹnu.
But the pictures made me laugh.	Ṣugbọn awọn aworan ṣe mi rẹrin.
I wonder which one.	Mo Iyanu eyi ti ọkan.
However, they are sisters.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn jẹ arabinrin.
There are many to think on both sides.	Ọpọlọpọ wa lati ronu ni ẹgbẹ mejeeji.
I do not know anything.	Emi ko mọ nkankan.
Not on shoes.	Ko lori bata.
Maybe you learned.	Boya o kọ ẹkọ.
Eating three meals a day is enough.	Njẹ ounjẹ mẹta ni ọjọ kan ti to.
And, he didn’t get anyone tonight.	Ati pe, ko gba ẹnikan ni alẹ oni.
If you only want to spend time, go outside.	Ti o ba fẹ lo akoko nikan, lọ si ita.
Nothing.	Nkan ko si.
In the house.	Ninu ile.
I want to do everything people do.	Mo fẹ lati ṣe gbogbo ohun ti eniyan ṣe.
I know you believe me.	Mo mọ pe o gba mi gbọ.
You will not want to move around too much.	Iwọ kii yoo fẹ lati gbe ni ayika pupọ.
Hard for anyone, either.	Lile fun ẹnikẹni, boya.
Nothing to say.	Ko si nkankan lati sọ.
It doesn't matter where you are.	Ko ṣe pataki ibiti o ti wa.
I am not good.	Emi ko dara.
Remember to lift your head.	Ranti lati gbe ori rẹ soke.
This can be done without hassle.	Eyi o le ṣe laisi wahala.
If you are, you will find.	Ti o ba wa, iwọ yoo rii.
I worried about him.	Mo ṣe aniyan fun u.
When life is hard, let it be easy.	Nigbati igbesi aye ba le, jẹ ki o rọrun.
I love it.	Mo nifẹ rẹ.
I do not know how.	Emi ko mọ bawo ni.
You will find it in the box.	Iwọ yoo rii ninu apoti.
He will not allow me.	Ko ni gba mi laaye.
It was also a game he played when he was little.	O tun jẹ ere ti o ṣe nigbati o jẹ kekere.
He will do anything for me.	Oun yoo ṣe ohunkohun fun mi.
It rained last night.	Ojo duro ni alẹ ana.
Everyone wants that.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ iyẹn.
Listen to what your doctor says.	Gbọ ohun ti dokita rẹ sọ.
The truth is that it is for everyone.	Otitọ ni pe o jẹ fun gbogbo eniyan.
We are tired and only two.	A ti rẹ wa ati meji nikan.
It should be removed for a reason.	O yẹ ki o yọ kuro fun idi.
You can fast.	O le sare.
I also recommend that you stay where you are.	Mo tun pe o yẹ ki o duro ni ibiti o wa.
And you have an ear to it.	Ati pe o ni eti si.
Time seemed to stop.	O dabi enipe akoko duro.
He moved to another school.	O gbe lọ si ile-iwe miiran.
Now this will not hurt much.	Bayi eyi kii yoo ṣe ipalara diẹ.
We must keep the rules.	A yẹ ki o pa awọn ofin mọ.
It was so nice to be home, he told us.	O dara pupọ lati wa ni ile, o sọ fun wa.
He did not think he would.	Ko ro pe oun yoo.
That will not be easy.	Iyẹn kii yoo rọrun.
He kissed her as he hit her.	O si ẹnu rẹ bi o ti n lu u.
At this point we stopped.	Ni aaye yii a duro.
I can wait.	Mo le duro.
It will take a month for it all to clear.	Yoo gba oṣu kan fun gbogbo rẹ lati ko kuro.
I'll dig it.	Mo ma wà rẹ.
You have to see what you can find there.	O ni lati wo ohun ti o le rii nibẹ.
But it is not possible.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣee ṣe.
I see you, do you see me?	Mo ri e, se o ri mi?
He was the best man in my marriage.	O jẹ ọkunrin ti o dara julọ ni igbeyawo mi.
See your sites.	Wo awọn aaye rẹ.
They are their own, but more so.	Wọn jẹ ara wọn, ṣugbọn diẹ sii bẹ.
If you do, we will miss you forever.	Ti o ba ṣe, a padanu rẹ lailai.
How we should live.	Bawo ni o yẹ ki a gbe.
It takes some time to keep your mouth shut.	O gba akoko diẹ lati pa ẹnu rẹ mọ.
I will have breakfast now.	Emi yoo jẹ ounjẹ owurọ ni bayi.
Or call me.	Tabi pe mi.
That changes everything, if you can make it work.	Iyẹn yi ohun gbogbo pada, ti o ba le jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
But that is not your concern now.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe aniyan rẹ ni bayi.
It was amazing to see.	O jẹ iyalẹnu lati rii.
That’s the way they come back.	Iyẹn ni ọna ti wọn tun pada.
You will do what you say.	Iwọ yoo ṣe ohun ti o sọ.
But this is not always possible.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko ṣee ṣe nigbagbogbo.
We'll get to that in a minute.	A yoo gba si iyẹn ni iṣẹju kan.
You will take a break now.	Iwọ yoo gba isinmi ni bayi.
He tied his hands together.	O di ọwọ rẹ papọ.
My job is not to be the best friend.	Iṣẹ mi kii ṣe lati jẹ ọrẹ to dara julọ.
There is no way this will do.	Ko si ọna ti eyi yoo ṣe.
And, it doesn’t need energy.	Ati pe, ko nilo agbara.
He saw things.	O si ri ohun.
Which in fact they have changed to be.	Eyi ti ni otitọ wọn ti yipada lati jẹ.
We will get one day at a time.	A yoo gba ni ọjọ kan ni akoko kan.
There was not a lot to say.	Nibẹ je ko kan pupo lati sọ.
I could still see every single one of their faces.	Mo tun le rii gbogbo ọkan ninu awọn oju wọn.
We made our own.	A ṣe ti ara wa.
Change the water twice this time.	Yi omi pada ni igba meji ni akoko yii.
We have to go.	A ni lati lọ.
But the story is completely true.	Ṣugbọn itan naa jẹ otitọ patapata.
They will be able to remove the bad.	Wọn yoo ni anfani lati mu awọn buburu kuro.
He climbed on the table.	O gun ori tabili.
It would be better to abandon the project.	Yoo dara julọ lati kọ iṣẹ naa silẹ.
I am your father's sister.	Arabinrin baba rẹ ni mi.
I would love to be with you.	Emi yoo gbadun lati wa pẹlu rẹ.
I was pulled up on my driveway.	A fa soke ni opopona mi.
Make poor decisions.	Ṣe awọn ipinnu ti ko dara.
In the end, someone will come for him.	Ni ipari, ẹnikan yoo wa fun u.
He came again and again.	O tun wa lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
Accident of art.	Ijamba ti aworan.
Can meet better.	Le pade dara julọ.
No, we must not forget him, his brother is not easy.	Rara, a ko gbọdọ gbagbe rẹ, arakunrin rẹ ko rọrun.
It’s what you see.	O jẹ ohun ti o rii.
Okay, let me think.	O dara, jẹ ki n ronu.
There is a big accident near here.	Ijamba nla kan wa nitosi ibi.
But in reality we may even be more convinced.	Ṣugbọn ni otitọ a le paapaa ni idaniloju diẹ sii.
The office box is still open.	Apoti ọfiisi ṣi ṣi silẹ.
Let's go.	Jẹ ki a lọ.
Maybe that’s not true, you know, even as you say.	Boya iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ, o mọ, paapaa bi o ti sọ.
Maybe two or three years.	Boya ọdun meji tabi mẹta.
You have to make your way.	O ni lati ṣe ọna rẹ.
But that doesn’t seem to help.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko dabi pe o ṣe iranlọwọ.
Because it’s not more than that.	Nitori kii ṣe diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
I am not telling anyone about this.	Nko so fun enikeni nipa eyi.
Okay, keep it.	O dara, o pa.
That needs to stop.	Iyẹn nilo lati da.
But we can drink.	Sugbon a le mu.
I couldn’t even bring myself to leave the room during the day.	Emi ko le paapaa mu ara mi lati lọ kuro ni yara nigba ọjọ.
But this is nothing new to them.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe nkan tuntun fun wọn.
He is asking a lot of it.	O n beere pupọ lọwọ rẹ.
He could not tell her that.	Ko le so fun u pe.
And you are.	Ati pe iwọ ni.
You are the one who has the power in this situation.	Iwọ ni ẹni ti o ni agbara ni ipo yii.
It's very simple and such a beautiful song.	O rọrun pupọ ati iru orin lẹwa kan.
I just need someone to give me life.	Mo kan nilo ẹnikan lati fun mi ni aye.
They won’t let you drink.	Wọn kii yoo jẹ ki o mu.
Of course you can.	Dajudaju o le.
What’s more, they look really good.	Kini diẹ sii, wọn wo gan dara julọ.
I have some money of my own.	Mo ni diẹ ninu owo ti ara mi.
That makes it a lot harder.	Iyẹn jẹ ki o nira pupọ sii.
But that did not work.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣiṣẹ.
For the story, go here.	Fun itan naa, lọ si ibi.
And he sat there.	O si joko nibẹ.
It doesn’t seem to feel good.	O dabi pe ko ni rilara ti o dara.
Other types of cars may be available.	Awọn iru ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ miiran le wa.
More to come obviously.	Diẹ sii lati wa han gbangba.
We have seen that.	A ti rii iyẹn.
I do not think so.	Emi ko ro pe.
Because of the heat we wore light clothes.	Nitori ooru ti a wọ aṣọ ina.
Get a feel on how it works.	Gba kan lero lori bi o ti ṣiṣẹ.
It started its way.	O bẹrẹ si ọna rẹ.
It seems to help.	O dabi ẹni pe o ṣe iranlọwọ.
Okay, one of the boys did.	O dara, ọkan ninu awọn ọmọkunrin ṣe.
I know everyone.	Mo mọ gbogbo eniyan.
There is no more time to think now.	Ko si akoko diẹ sii lati ronu ni bayi.
I saw it caught in front of my eyes.	Mo ti ri i ti a mu ni iwaju oju mi.
He does not know what can happen.	Ko si mọ ohun ti o le ṣẹlẹ.
but really, it was a good day.	sugbon gan, o je kan ti o dara ọjọ.
Man and dog.	Eniyan ati aja.
So we changed wisdom.	Nitorina a yipada ọgbọn.
So he left some.	Nitorina o fi diẹ silẹ.
I do not want to say so.	Emi ko fẹ lati sọ bẹ.
Go see for yourself.	Lọ wo ara rẹ.
Now you wonder why.	Bayi o ṣe iyalẹnu idi.
He looked at the fire.	O wo ina naa.
The man would be there to feed the dog.	Ọkunrin naa yoo wa nibẹ lati jẹun aja.
We ate dinner.	A jẹ ounjẹ alẹ.
But it has arrived.	Sugbon o ti de.
Every summer it becomes one of the best.	Ni gbogbo igba ooru o di ọkan ti o dara julọ.
Our time here is over.	Akoko wa nibi ti pari.
I mean, just fine.	Mo tumọ si, o kan dara.
However, he thought it was impossible.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ro pe ko ṣee ṣe.
The seating area is also wood.	Agbegbe ijoko tun jẹ igi.
We need it.	A nilo re.
This is about what is best for my child.	Eyi jẹ nipa ohun ti o dara julọ fun ọmọ mi.
The drinks are a bad idea.	Awọn ohun mimu naa jẹ imọran buburu.
He does not want to go.	Ko fe lo.
Some men will even notice.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọkunrin yoo ṣe akiyesi paapaa.
But that should never happen.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko gbọdọ ṣẹlẹ rara.
Money needed.	Owo nilo.
No, while living.	Ko, nigba ti o ngbe.
I was there.	Mo wa nibẹ.
Of course, he did not know me.	Dajudaju, ko mọ mi.
Everyone is forgotten.	Gbogbo eniyan jẹ gbagbe.
You can't believe your eyes.	O ko le gbagbọ oju rẹ.
All tests were performed three times.	Gbogbo awọn idanwo ni a ṣe ni igba mẹta.
It’s time to do something completely new.	O to akoko lati ṣe nkan tuntun patapata.
I thought about that for a long time.	Mo ronu nipa iyẹn fun igba pipẹ.
They both decided to go out for the night.	Awọn mejeeji pinnu lati jade lọ fun alẹ.
He wanted to show it to his friends.	O fe lati fi han si awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
Until they do not know.	Titi ti won ko mọ.
I'm sure that once you have read the book,	Mo da mi loju pe ni kete ti o ba ti ka iwe naa,
My mother stopped because where is your family.	Iya mi duro nitori pe nibo ni idile rẹ wa.
Have done other tests.	Ti ṣe awọn idanwo miiran.
He will not accept.	Oun ko ni gba.
They are something you have to see to believe.	Wọn jẹ nkan ti o ni lati rii lati gbagbọ.
This is good in some ways.	Eyi ti o dara ni diẹ ninu awọn ọna.
It's too hot, he can't get it.	O gbona gan, ko le gba a.
The hair sticks out of the front of his head.	Irun naa fi ara mọ iwaju ori rẹ.
I think they will find it good.	Mo ro pe wọn yoo rii pe o dara.
We are going this way.	A n lọ si ọna yii.
If not for me.	Ti kii ba ṣe fun mi.
But not on this page.	Sugbon ko lori iwe yi.
Or for yourself.	Tabi fun ara rẹ.
Make it simple, now.	Ṣe o rọrun, ni bayi.
Maybe he'll be in the same tree.	Boya oun yoo wa ni igi kanna.
We had to take him to the back of the car.	A ni lati mu u ni ẹhin ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
It helps a lot of kids out there.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde jade nibẹ.
There is no sun now.	Ko si oorun bayi.
We want to make this point as clear as possible.	A fẹ lati sọ aaye yii han bi a ti le ṣe.
Enjoy every day.	Gbadun ọjọ gbogbo.

They are finished with it.	Wọn ti pari pẹlu rẹ.
And still not.	Ati ki o si tun ko.
I can do all that.	Mo le ṣe gbogbo iyẹn.
This also applies to pictures.	Eyi tun kan si awọn aworan.
I probably miss something obvious.	O ṣee ṣe ki n padanu nkan ti o han gbangba.
No one can do it alone.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o le ṣe nikan.

This is the main reason in this book.	Eyi ni idi pataki ninu iwe yii.
The reasons for this are many.	Awọn idi fun eyi ni ọpọlọpọ.
Which is more worrying.	Eyi ti o ṣe aniyan diẹ sii.
I have never seen that in any woman before.	Emi ko rii iyẹn ni eyikeyi obinrin tẹlẹ.
They will not buy them.	Wọn kii yoo ra wọn.
It takes a few minutes before you can start again.	O to iṣẹju diẹ ṣaaju ki o le bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
Both her parents worked.	Awọn obi rẹ mejeeji ṣiṣẹ.
It makes you need to help him at all he plays.	O jẹ ki o nilo lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u ni gbogbo ti o dun.
It sounds like a simple task but to my surprise, it was not.	O dabi iṣẹ ti o rọrun ṣugbọn si iyalẹnu mi, kii ṣe.
What do you think.	Ohun ti o ti ṣe ro bi.
The men around him began to laugh.	Awọn ọkunrin ti o wa ni ayika rẹ bẹrẹ si rẹrin.
They have never seen anything like it before.	Wọn ko tii ri iru eyi tẹlẹ.
He poured great energy into his work.	O da agbara nla sinu iṣẹ rẹ.
I can't reach you.	Emi ko le de ọdọ rẹ.
But you have the wrong reason.	Ṣugbọn o ni idi ti ko tọ.
This was a while ago.	Eyi jẹ igba diẹ sẹhin.
Say, it is a picture.	Sọ, o jẹ aworan kan.
That could almost change.	Iyẹn le fẹrẹ yipada.
And it comes at the right time.	Ati pe o wa ni akoko ti o tọ.
We will not have time to leave me.	A kii yoo ni akoko lati fi mi silẹ.
He would not want it any other way.	Kii yoo fẹ ni ọna miiran.
I do not know why, but this last situation is good.	Ko mọ idi rẹ, ṣugbọn ipo ikẹhin yii dara.
You can see that something has hit him.	O le rii pe ohun kan ti lu u.
That will save me.	Iyẹn yoo gba mi silẹ.
They go out with people.	Wọn jade pẹlu eniyan.
They will be at home.	Wọn yoo wa ni ile.
Make a deal for you.	Ṣe adehun fun ọ.
Here is how we do it.	Eyi ni bi a ṣe ṣe.
That’s the same way you go to your desk.	Iyẹn ni ọna kanna ti o lọ si tabili rẹ.
It belongs to the cause of the tail, and it is broken.	O je ti awọn fa iru, ati awọn ti o ti fọ.
By the way, do you like tea?	Nipa ọna, ṣe o fẹran tii?
Down here through the gardens.	Si isalẹ nibi nipasẹ awọn ọgba.

I don’t think anyone did.	Emi ko ro pe ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe.
I can see you do it.	Mo le rii pe o ṣe.
This seems like a personal problem.	Eyi dabi iṣoro ti ara ẹni.
We mean.	A tumọ si.
I love these people here.	Mo nifẹ awọn eniyan wọnyi nibi.
The news is true.	Awọn iroyin jẹ otitọ.
They must submit the application first.	Wọn gbọdọ fi ohun elo silẹ ni akọkọ.
Many others, not found.	Awọn ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran, ko ri.
That way, we are such a true team.	Ni ọna yẹn, a jẹ iru ẹgbẹ otitọ kan.
They will wait for you.	Wọn yoo duro de ọ.
He will be back in two days to pick them up.	Oun yoo pada wa ni ọjọ meji lati mu wọn lọ.
It takes a person.	O gba eniyan kan.
Just do it, please.	Jọwọ, kan ṣe.
So you need to understand what this law is.	Nitorina o nilo lati loye kini ofin yii jẹ.
He looked at me.	O wo mi.
There are others, however, who are unsure.	Awọn miiran wa, sibẹsibẹ, ti ko ni idaniloju.
The dog has to stand outside.	Aja ni lati duro si ita.
When they want to hit you, they will hit you.	Nigbati wọn ba fẹ lati lu ọ, wọn yoo lu ọ.
I can change that.	Mo le yi iyẹn pada.
You have this.	O ni eyi.
But we give ourselves a chance.	Ṣugbọn a fun ara wa ni anfani.
If you do not believe me, read on.	Ti o ko ba gbagbọ mi, ka lori.
And this girl.	Ati ọmọbirin yii.
We have to go a long way.	A ni lati lọ si ọna pipẹ pupọ.
Let me see.	Jẹ ki n ri.
This is a top-down agreement only.	Eyi jẹ adehun ni oke nikan.
I would be, even.	Emi yoo jẹ, paapaa.
There is no fire.	Ko si ina.
You take good care of your car.	O tọju ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ daradara.
The lives of the people in this area are not good.	Awọn igbesi aye awọn eniyan ni agbegbe yii ko dara.
I started to think about how they did.	Mo bẹrẹ lati ronu bi wọn ṣe ṣe.
It is important to the image.	O ṣe pataki si aworan.
We did it well.	A ṣe o dara.
How can I go that way.	Bi mo ṣe le lọ ni ọna yẹn.
I do not know what else.	Emi ko mọ kini ohun miiran.
You will leave.	Iwọ yoo fi silẹ.
They say more.	Wọn sọ diẹ.
For we think it does not.	Fun a ro pe ko ṣe.
He said this will make our hair look better.	O sọ pe eyi yoo jẹ ki irun wa dara julọ.
No, do not be afraid again.	Rara, maṣe bẹru lẹẹkansi.
You do not want here.	O ko fẹ nibi.
Everyone was amazed.	Ẹnu ya gbogbo eniyan.
And they were good at that job.	Ati pe wọn dara ni iṣẹ yẹn.
I love to eat them as food myself.	Mo nifẹ lati jẹ wọn bi ounjẹ funrararẹ.
They tell stories.	Wọn sọ awọn itan.
You have to do it now.	O ni lati ṣe ni bayi.
They do one day for the next week.	Wọn ṣe ọjọ kan fun ọsẹ to nbọ.
You can enjoy them.	O le gbadun wọn.
The one ahead is not the best financial decision for me.	Eyi ti o wa ni iwaju kii ṣe ipinnu owo ti o dara julọ fun mi.
He doesn’t seem to know what’s going on either.	O dabi pe ko mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ boya.
Nothing has changed over the years.	Ko si ohun ti yi pada lori awọn ọdun.
I love it too.	Mo nifẹ rẹ pẹlu.
That was in the morning.	Iyẹn ni owurọ.
He could not raise his hand, he could not sleep.	Ko le gbe ọwọ rẹ, ko le sun.
It has amazing gifts.	O ni awọn ẹbun iyalẹnu.
He is a ‘can do’ person.	O jẹ eniyan 'le ṣe'.
Maybe you already know.	Boya o ti mọ.
I know that city inside and out.	Mo mọ ilu yẹn inu ati ita.
Same thing all the time.	Ohun kanna ni gbogbo igba.
Now what? 	Bayi kini?
he thought.	o ro.
The day has become morning.	Ọjọ ti di owurọ.
I'll come back to that.	Emi yoo pada wa si iyẹn.
This is not for everyone, of course.	Eyi kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan, dajudaju.
He sat there for a long time.	O joko nibẹ fun igba pipẹ.
Until then.	Titi o ko.
I would say what kind of boy he is.	Emi yoo sọ iru ọmọkunrin ti o jẹ.
And not nearly enough.	Ati pe ko fẹrẹ to.
It is now, even.	O jẹ bayi, paapaa.
He has more of the front, you have to give him that.	O ni diẹ ti iwaju, o ni lati fi fun u pe.
It was out of their money range.	O je jade ti won owo ibiti.
It's over, done.	O ti kọja, ṣe.
I told him.	Mo sọ fun u.
he asked.	o beere.
Learn how to finish your story before you start.	Mọ bi o ṣe fẹ pari itan rẹ ṣaaju ki o to bẹrẹ.
I mean, you have to pull back and think about it.	Mo tumọ si, o ni lati fa sẹhin ki o ronu nipa rẹ.
But that did not work.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣiṣẹ.
This is a more serious matter.	Eleyi jẹ kan diẹ to ṣe pataki ọrọ.
It is great to talk in terms that you can understand.	O ṣe akiyesi nla lati sọrọ ni awọn ofin ti o le loye.
I never spoke to any of them again.	Emi ko tun sọrọ si eyikeyi ninu wọn.
It does not take long.	Ko gba to gun.
Morning works best for this task.	Owurọ ṣiṣẹ dara julọ fun iṣẹ yii.
Where no one will see him.	Si ibi ti ko si ọkan yoo ri i.
It’s how kids learn.	O jẹ bi awọn ọmọde ṣe kọ ẹkọ.
We have not yet eaten the same.	A ko tii jẹ kanna.
We don’t want to, but we will.	A ko fẹ, ṣugbọn a yoo.
They decided to return to the city.	Wọn pinnu lati pada si ilu.
No work is irrelevant.	Ko si iṣẹ ko ṣe pataki.
Life does not matter here.	Igbesi aye ko ṣe pataki nibi.
He is looking for the car.	O n wa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
But tell him to do something more.	Ṣugbọn sọ fun u lati ṣe nkan diẹ sii.
No one called my attention.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o pe akiyesi mi si.
Same on my side.	Kanna ni ẹgbẹ mi.
His mother found them and contacted the police.	Iya rẹ ri wọn o si kan si ọlọpa.
You can also sometimes to understand the value.	O tun le nigba miiran lati ni oye ti iye.
You can try to work your way up.	O le gbiyanju lati ṣiṣẹ ọna rẹ soke.
Walk me back.	Rin mi pada.
You have made a decision.	O ti ṣe ipinnu kan.
A year earlier.	Odun kan ṣaaju.
It does not seem to have been used for a very long time.	O dabi pe ko ti lo fun igba pipẹ pupọ.
I am your mother now.	Emi ni iya re bayi.
You don't want to think about it now.	O ko fẹ lati ronu rẹ ni bayi.
Some already.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti tẹlẹ.
You will be happy here.	Inu re yoo dun nibi.
He thought it was not only important but important.	O ro pe kii ṣe pataki nikan ṣugbọn o ṣe pataki.
There is a woman, older than you, tired.	Obinrin kan wa, ti o dagba ju ọ lọ, ti o rẹ.
They expect us to do.	Wọn nireti wa lati ṣe.
No need to.	Ko nilo lati.
I can't tell.	Nko le so fun.
We want to do, so we do.	A fẹ ṣe, nitorina a ṣe.
I am not convinced that we have seen the world with the same eyes.	Emi ko da mi loju pe a ti ri aye pẹlu oju kanna.
I want that.	Mo fe bẹ.
I would ask a lot of it.	Emi yoo beere pupọ lọwọ rẹ.
I'm happy for him.	Inu mi dun fun u.
This is not easy.	Eyi ko rọrun.
There is a law to this day.	Ofin kan wa titi di oni.
They need to know this before they try to write.	Wọn nilo lati mọ eyi ṣaaju ki wọn gbiyanju lati kọ.
I wonder if they ever thought we were that way.	Mo Iyanu boya wọn lailai ro ti wa ni ọna yẹn.
You deserve the position.	O tọ si ipo naa.
I don’t think it will hurt any of us.	Emi ko ro pe yoo ṣe ipalara eyikeyi ninu wa.
Any more of anything.	Eyikeyi diẹ sii ti ohunkohun.
You have to write it down.	O ni lati kọ si isalẹ.
Remember he is not young anymore.	Ranti pe ko jẹ ọdọ mọ.
We don’t know how to let it go.	A ko mọ bi a ṣe le jẹ ki o lọ.
That changed me.	Iyẹn ni o yi mi pada.
Or come to it.	Tabi o wa si ọdọ rẹ.
Tell yourself that everything will be fine.	Sọ fun ara rẹ pe ohun gbogbo yoo dara.
So we got people to go open the door.	Nitorina a ni eniyan lati lọ ṣii ilẹkun.
Tell me, tell me.	Sọ fun mi, sọ fun mi.
There you will get your friend.	Nibẹ ni yoo gba ọrẹ rẹ.
Drive well, my boy.	Wakọ daradara, ọmọkunrin mi.
And others.	Ati awọn miiran.
Hide your questions.	Tọju awọn ibeere rẹ.
You stick to it and let it go.	O duro lori ko si jẹ ki o lọ.
It was a good meal.	O jẹ ounjẹ to dara.
I did not try.	Emi ko gbiyanju.
I don’t think it’s there yet.	Emi ko ro pe o wa nibẹ sibẹsibẹ.
However, boats are not on the beach.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ọkọ oju omi ko si ni eti okun.
We ate, bathed, climbed into bed.	A jẹun, a wẹ, a gun ori ibusun wa.
We have done more.	A ti ṣe diẹ.
What is your favorite food?	Iru ounjẹ wo ni o fẹran julọ?
Ask them what they want and why.	Beere wọn ohun ti wọn fẹ ati idi ti.
We’re almost done here.	A ti fẹrẹ ṣe nibi.
He never found his father.	Ko wa baba rẹ rara.
That’s the idea, if you will.	Iyẹn ni imọran, ti o ba fẹ.
However here it comes to you.	Sibẹsibẹ nibi o wa si ọdọ rẹ.
Give them some space.	Fun wọn ni aaye diẹ.
I want to be better tomorrow.	Mo fẹ lati dara ni ọla.
A new store is about to open here.	Ile itaja tuntun kan ti fẹrẹ ṣii nibi.
If we don’t get it now, we won’t.	Ti a ko ba gba ni bayi, a kii yoo.
We know what we can do here.	A mọ ohun ti a le ṣe nibi.
Listen to better music.	Gbọ orin to dara diẹ sii.
Whether or not we know this, there is.	Boya tabi a ko mọ eyi, o wa.
So, beautiful.	Nitorina, lẹwa.
I was still inside until then.	Mo tun wa ninu inu titi di akoko yẹn.
He raised his hand to the spot.	O gbe ọwọ rẹ si aaye naa.
He left a few days ago.	O kuro ni awọn ọjọ diẹ sẹhin.
I'm glad you improved.	Inu mi dun pe o dara si i.
Explain how they can get the word out.	Ṣe alaye bi wọn ṣe le gba ọrọ naa.
He was not going to be able to do this.	O si ti a ko lilọ si ni anfani lati ṣe eyi.
I see no reason or reason in it.	Nko ri idi tabi ori ninu re.
You can work on those times for weeks.	O le ṣiṣẹ lori awọn akoko yẹn fun awọn ọsẹ.
This was one of those moments.	Eyi jẹ ọkan ninu awọn akoko yẹn.
Just let it go.	Kan jẹ ki o tọ.
You look at your friends.	O wo awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
I'm glad you're here.	Inu mi dun pe o wa nibi.
Make sure you drink water.	Rii daju pe o ti mu omi.
I am going from station to station.	Mo n lọ lati ibudo si ibudo.
It has happened again.	O ti ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
They want me in the best school they can.	Wọn fẹ mi ni ile-iwe ti o dara julọ ti wọn sọ.
The road goes down to the train station.	Opopona lọ si isalẹ si ibudo ọkọ oju irin.
It rains a little, but there is water.	O gba ojo kekere, ṣugbọn omi wa.
There are two children in school.	Awọn ọmọde meji wa ni ile-iwe.
Most people are interested in this story.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan nifẹ si itan yii.
This time could not get any better.	Akoko yi ko le gba eyikeyi dara.
In this the other way around.	Ninu eyi ni ọna miiran ni ayika.
That's just your opinion.	Iyẹn nikan ni ero rẹ.
And that’s your problem, not anyone else’s.	Ati pe iyẹn ni iṣoro rẹ, kii ṣe ẹnikẹni miiran.
Come by our people in minutes.	Wa nipasẹ awọn eniyan wa ni iṣẹju.
At this point, it started to fill.	Ni akoko yii, o bẹrẹ si kun.
There is nothing to hide.	Ko si nkankan lati tọju.
As we will now.	Bi a yoo ṣe ni bayi.
An hour drive from the beach and a town	Wakọ wakati kan lati eti okun ati ilu kan wa
This is all the way or nothing.	Eyi jẹ ọna gbogbo tabi ohunkohun.
I decided to get it this time.	Mo pinnu lati gba ni akoko yii.
But the big ones are up.	Ṣugbọn awọn nla wa ni oke.
I'm glad to hear from you.	Inu mi dun lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
But they are not gifts that anyone can use.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii ṣe ẹbun ti ẹnikẹni le lo.
Get off both feet.	Lọ kuro ni ẹsẹ mejeeji.
The agreement does not compromise on either side.	Adehun naa ko ṣe adehun si ẹgbẹ mejeeji.
They are about your age.	Wọn jẹ nipa ọjọ ori rẹ.
I have this.	Mo ni eyi.
But so did they.	Ṣugbọn bẹẹ ni gbogbo wọn ṣe.
If one is not in your area, start one.	Ti ọkan ko ba si ni agbegbe rẹ, bẹrẹ ọkan.
Or maybe it just hasn’t happened to him.	Tabi boya o kan ko ti ṣẹlẹ si i.
He would of course not do so at all.	Oun yoo dajudaju ko ṣe bẹ rara.
It is not a good idea to jump into the water.	Ko ṣe imọran ti o dara lati fo sinu omi.
He doesn’t expect to know your story forever.	Ko nireti lati mọ itan rẹ lailai.
I agree with both points.	Mo gba pẹlu awọn aaye mejeeji.
It doesn't matter anymore.	Ko ṣe pataki mọ.
It was a matter of time.	O jẹ ọrọ ti akoko naa.
I may not have much time.	Mo le ma ni akoko pupọ.
How will he come back.	Bawo ni yoo ṣe pada wa.
Even, you may not want to kill them, he said.	Paapaa, o le ma fẹ lati pa wọn, o sọ.
It was nice to see them again.	O je dara lati ri wọn lẹẹkansi.
We asked them.	A beere wọn.
Do whatever it takes to complete this.	Ṣe ohunkohun ti o jẹ ti o pari eyi.
I saw first hand the good and not so good.	Mo ti ri akọkọ ọwọ awọn ti o dara ati ki o ko ki dara.
And nothing.	Ati pe ko si nkankan.
Very powerful.	Agbara pupọ.
People will travel through space one day.	Awọn eniyan yoo rin irin-ajo nipasẹ aaye ni ọjọ kan.
You have made a decision.	O ti ṣe ipinnu.
That's how we got here.	Bi a ṣe de ibi niyẹn.
They are doing well.	Wọn n ṣe daradara.
We have been married for two years now.	A ti ṣe igbeyawo fun ọdun meji bayi.
Just know me.	O kan mọ mi.
It's not that people really believe.	Kii ṣe pe awọn eniyan gbagbọ gaan.
But consider this.	Ṣugbọn ro eyi.
I hate it here so much.	Mo korira rẹ nibi pupọ.
But, one should be what one really is.	Ṣugbọn, ọkan yẹ ki o jẹ ohun ti ẹnikan jẹ gaan.
We never talked.	A ko sọrọ rara.
I will paint.	Emi yoo kun mi.
So they will not.	Nitorina wọn kii yoo.
We will be here when you need us.	A yoo wa nibi nigbati o ba nilo wa.
You want more, much more.	O fẹ diẹ sii, pupọ diẹ sii.
No one stopped, so he said nothing.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o da, nitorina ko sọ nkankan.
Wait more.	Duro diẹ sii.
You can see they have.	O le rii pe wọn ni.
You too, man.	Iwọ naa, ọkunrin.
Not with me.	Ko pẹlu mi.
So that's what we did.	Nitorina ohun ti a ṣe niyẹn.
Of course it should.	Dajudaju o yẹ.
It makes them feel good.	O mu ki wọn lero ti o dara.
They would love to hear from you.	Wọn yoo nifẹ lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
I have no help calling.	Emi ko ni iranlọwọ lati pe.
I made money and spent the money.	Mo ṣe owo ati lo owo naa.
Old store, old hour.	Ile itaja atijọ, wakati atijọ.
But do not be discouraged.	Ṣugbọn maṣe da ọ loju.
I can see that this world is not my life.	Mo le rii pe aye yii kii ṣe aye mi.
The music goes around a place.	Orin naa n lọ ni ayika aaye kan.
I love to play games.	Mo ni ife lati mu awọn ere.
We will all die, we know.	Gbogbo wa ni yoo ku, eyi ni a mọ.
There is no obvious benefit.	Ko si anfani ti o han gbangba.
They made themselves very busy.	Wọn ṣe ara wọn lọwọ pupọ.
And it is not true that no one saw it.	Ati pe kii ṣe otitọ pe ko si ẹnikan ti o rii.
I'm very pleased to meet you.	Inu mi dun gan lati pade yin.
But life is won.	Sugbon igbesi aye ni a gba.
I think you want to.	Mo ro pe o fe.
I will go because everything is my opinion.	Emi yoo lọ nitori pe gbogbo nkan ni imọran mi.
I think it was.	Mo ro pe o je.
On it goes.	Lori o lọ.
But he seems to like it.	Ṣugbọn o dabi pe o fẹran rẹ.
You don’t want the world to end.	O ko fẹ aye lati pari.
And, of course ,.	Ati, dajudaju,.
And don’t worry.	Ati pe ko ṣe aniyan.
Insert cords if possible.	Fi awọn okun sii ti o ba ṣeeṣe.
You read it out of your favorite storybook.	O ka jade lati inu iwe itan ayanfẹ rẹ.
They have a lot of time on their hands.	Wọn ni akoko pupọ lori ọwọ wọn.
But they are not looking for money.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko wa owo.
I noticed it for the first time.	Mo ṣe akiyesi rẹ fun igba akọkọ.
That was a clean night.	Ti o wà ni alẹ ti o mọ.
I have to keep my eyes on it.	Mo gbọdọ pa oju mi ​​mọ lori rẹ.
This is the powerhouse of the future.	Eyi ni ibudo agbara ti ojo iwaju.
I know it won't be long.	Mo mọ pe kii yoo pẹ.
The idea is to pay a price for human life.	Ero naa ni lati san owo kan fun igbesi aye eniyan.
His father told him to get a job.	Baba rẹ sọ fun u pe ki o gba iṣẹ kan.
It can be a very long night.	O le jẹ alẹ ti o gun pupọ.
Everything else you say, however, is wrong.	Gbogbo ohun miiran ti o sọ, sibẹsibẹ, jẹ aṣiṣe.
Here is what happened in the story.	Eyi ni ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ninu itan naa.
This area has harsh winters.	Agbegbe yii ni awọn igba otutu lile.
It takes a long time to sleep out.	O gba akoko pipẹ lati sun jade.
Call them and ask.	Pe wọn ki o beere.
It is never too late to believe.	Ko ti pẹ ju lati gbagbọ.
I have no idea how to do that.	Emi ko ni imọran bi o ṣe le ṣe iyẹn.
Not when you look at them from a house.	Kii ṣe nigbati o n wo wọn lati inu ile kan.
He, for some reason, did not want to see me.	Oun, fun idi kan, ko fẹ lati ri mi.
I don't like it very much.	Emi ko fẹran rẹ ni pataki.
Have a small group of friends?	Ni ẹgbẹ kekere ti awọn ọrẹ?
I know it will be your first thought.	Mo mọ pe yoo jẹ ero akọkọ rẹ.
And maybe it's worth it.	Ati boya o tọ.
Sorry if that is not enough for you.	Ma binu ti iyẹn ko ba to fun ọ.
You need another.	O nilo miiran.
She told him she could do it herself.	O sọ fun u pe o le ṣe funrararẹ.
But you know what a person looks like.	Ṣugbọn o mọ bi eniyan ṣe dabi.
I hope someone kills him.	Mo nireti pe ẹnikan pa a.
It is completely legal.	O jẹ ofin patapata.
I mean you know what a house should be.	Mo tumọ si pe o mọ bi ile yẹ ki o jẹ.
It will also be my own big car.	O tun yoo jẹ ọkọ nla ti ara mi.
A book, perhaps.	Iwe kan, boya.
This is personal, you understand.	Eyi jẹ ti ara ẹni, o loye.
I completely rejected it.	Mo kọ ọ patapata.
They tell me now.	Wọn sọ fun mi bayi.
They are not good to look at.	Wọn ko dara lati wo.
But he wanted to.	Sugbon o fe.
I don't know.	Ko san.
We just agree.	A kan gba.
It comes with the contract.	O wa pẹlu adehun naa.
I’m not sure if that is a good thing or not.	Emi ko dajudaju boya iyẹn jẹ ohun ti o dara tabi rara.
Now these are the facts.	Bayi awọn wọnyi jẹ awọn otitọ.
You always have to be at home with our child.	O nigbagbogbo ni lati wa ni ile pẹlu ọmọ wa.
They will not button on my forehead.	Won yoo ko bọtini lori mi iwaju.
What a life.	Kini igbesi aye.
But it hurts me a lot, a lot.	Ṣugbọn o dun mi gidigidi, pupọ.
It is their money.	Owo won ni.
I want to know you better.	Mo fẹ lati mọ ọ dara julọ.
Some of these methods are what you get.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọna wọnyi ni ohun ti o gba.
This can happen to boys as well.	Eyi le ṣẹlẹ si awọn ọmọkunrin pẹlu.
At the time he said everything was fine.	Ni akoko ti o sọ pe ohun gbogbo dara.
It should be removed for a reason.	O yẹ ki o yọ kuro fun idi.
This goes both ways, of course.	Eyi n lọ awọn ọna mejeeji, dajudaju.
But you are going to hit this one.	Sugbon o ti wa ni lilọ lati lu yi ọkan.
I will pay you back next week.	Emi yoo san pada fun ọ ni ọsẹ to nbọ.
But he is also our father.	Sugbon o tun je baba wa.
He, his wife and two children live with his father.	Oun, iyawo rẹ ati awọn ọmọ meji gbe pẹlu baba rẹ.
Please let us be.	Jọwọ jẹ ki o wa.
However, there are several problems with this approach.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn iṣoro pupọ wa pẹlu ọna yii.
It is not that we are afraid.	Kii ṣe pe a bẹru.
I want to talk to him.	Mo fẹ lati ba a sọrọ.
Company profits have dropped.	Awọn ere ile-iṣẹ ti lọ silẹ.
But it is not necessary.	Ṣugbọn ko nilo.
And tell me where they want me to go.	Ki o si sọ ibi ti wọn fẹ ki o lọ fun mi.
None of the best, as it turns out.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ti o dara julọ, bi o ti wa ni jade.
If you want to test now, we will do it now.	Ti o ba fẹ ni idanwo ni bayi, a yoo ṣe ni bayi.
You know that very well.	O mọ iyẹn pupọ.
Don't let your life get in the way.	Maṣe jẹ ki igbesi aye rẹ kọja ọ.
It was a sight to behold.	O jẹ oju lati ri.
When I close my application.	Nigbati mo pa ohun elo mi.
Maybe it felt like a game for both of you.	Boya o ro bi ere kan fun yin mejeeji.
He has a father.	O ni baba kan.
They are too fast.	Wọn yara ju.
It does not seem to be taking place.	O dabi pe o ko gba aaye naa.
Everyone knows it.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ o.
That is how it is with me.	Bi o ti ri pẹlu mi niyẹn.
I have one.	Mo ni ọkan.
She tried to say something but nothing came out.	O gbiyanju lati sọ nkan ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o jade.
I know there are many others.	Mo mọ pe ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran wa.
We hope you can visit again.	A nireti pe o le ṣabẹwo si lẹẹkansi.
This book is easy to find.	O rọrun lati wa iwe yii.
He talked about the situation with no one outside his house.	O sọrọ nipa ipo naa pẹlu ko si ẹnikan ni ita ile rẹ.
I can get it.	Mo le gba.
In most cases, it does not.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba, ko ṣe.
And that is.	Ati pe iyẹn ni.
Go with it now.	Lọ pẹlu rẹ ni bayi.
He has not yet called wisdom.	Ko tii pe ọgbọn.
Make sure you do it for the right reasons.	Rii daju pe o n ṣe fun awọn idi to tọ.
I do not know your first name.	Emi ko mọ orukọ akọkọ rẹ.
Many of them are very motherly about this.	Pupọ ninu wọn jẹ iya pupọ nipa eyi.
Not able to walk, much less run.	Ko ni anfani lati rin, Elo kere si ṣiṣe.
I know you are.	Mo mọ pe iwọ ni.
You get to love the best friend with all your heart.	O gba lati nifẹ ọrẹ to dara julọ pẹlu gbogbo ọkan rẹ.

If you really go through with this.	Ti o ba gan lọ nipasẹ pẹlu yi.
It was amazing to see.	O jẹ iyalẹnu lati rii.
But it did not happen to me.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣẹlẹ si mi.
It should have gone.	O yẹ ki o ti lọ.
I can't really imagine what the problem is.	Emi ko le ro ero kini iṣoro naa gaan.
I don’t want to give up on it.	Emi ko fẹ lati fun soke lori o.
Easy to write.	Rọrun lati kọ.
They want to help people everywhere.	Wọn fẹ lati ran eniyan lọwọ nibi gbogbo.
I can feel her standing back there.	Mo ti le lero rẹ duro pada nibẹ.
If you want a meeting come to me.	Ti o ba fẹ ipade kan o wa si ọdọ mi.
And he never knew.	Ati pe ko si mọ.
They are very good.	Wọn dara pupọ.
No husband, no sister.	Ko si ọkọ, ko si arabinrin.
He goes, he looks back.	O n lọ, o wo ẹhin.
So life is gone.	Nitorina igbesi aye ti lọ.
What, therefore, came to the girl.	Kini, nitorina, wa si ọmọbirin naa.
It was for another time and another place.	O jẹ fun akoko miiran ati aaye miiran.
They are not late.	Wọn ko pẹ.
You become harder and harder.	Ti o di le ati ki o le.
I come back all the time.	Mo maa pada wa ni gbogbo igba.
You have to meet him.	O ni lati pade rẹ.
But something good.	Ṣugbọn nkan ti o dara.
Something is wrong here.	Nkankan wa ni aṣiṣe nibi.
They need work.	Wọn nilo fun iṣẹ.
By the way.	Bi o ti le je pe.
I don't want to say anything.	Emi ko fẹ lati sọ fun ohunkohun.
We will be leaving here soon.	A yoo lọ kuro nibi laipẹ.
Everything is understood now.	Ohun gbogbo ni oye bayi.
It is very important in this.	O ṣe pataki julọ ninu eyi.
I understand how it can hurt you inside.	Mo loye bi o ṣe le ṣe ipalara fun ọ ninu.
There really aren't any.	Nibẹ gan ni o wa ko eyikeyi.
Two of them wanted to get married.	Meji ninu wọn ti fẹ lati ṣe igbeyawo.
We are the ones who become down.	A jẹ awọn ti o di isalẹ.
This guy, you just want to love.	Ọmọkunrin yii, ti o kan fẹ lati nifẹ.
It should not continue.	Ko yẹ ki o tẹsiwaju.
It is the way of your people.	O jẹ ọna awọn eniyan rẹ.
There are not many stories that are so.	Ko si ọpọlọpọ awọn itan ti o jẹ bẹ.
He never expected to hurt her.	Oun ko nireti rara lati ṣe ipalara fun u.
At least we will get a hot lunch.	O kere ju a yoo gba ounjẹ ọsan ti o gbona.
I am a human being.	Eniyan ni mi.
You should meet him.	O yẹ ki o pade rẹ.
I think this has forced me.	Mo ro pe eyi ti fi agbara mu mi.
I wrote a letter to my mother.	Mo kọ lẹta kan si iya mi.
Or agree with it.	Tabi gba pẹlu rẹ.
I get a job.	Mo gba iṣẹ.
Just enjoy it.	O kan gbadun rẹ.
I am physically.	Mo jẹ ara.
Maybe it can make you like it better.	Boya o le jẹ ki o fẹran rẹ dara julọ.
Start your own story now !.	Bẹrẹ itan tirẹ ni bayi!.
And the children understand.	Ati awọn ọmọ loye.
All these beautiful.	Gbogbo awọn wọnyi lẹwa.
I really need a break.	Mo nilo isinmi gaan.
But that was the week before.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ni ọsẹ ṣaaju.
I'm sure you're tired.	O da mi loju pe o ti re.
It's human.	Eniyan ni.
I need to know that you can do so.	Mo nilo lati mọ pe o le ṣe bẹ.
One of them is married with three children.	Ọkan ninu wọn ni iyawo pẹlu ọmọ mẹta.
It can last a week or two.	O le ṣiṣe ni ọsẹ kan si meji.
I am.	Emi naa.
I have many other friends also in the party.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ miiran tun wa ninu ayẹyẹ naa.
We are completely cut off from the outside world.	A ti ge wa patapata lati ita aye.
It doesn't work very well.	Ko ṣiṣẹ daradara daradara.
But not in the way it means.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ni ọna ti o tumọ si.
No return !.	Ko si pada!.
He took over the company.	O gba ile-iṣẹ naa.
It was a love that just went into my head.	O jẹ ifẹ ti o kan wọ inu ori mi.
I was afraid to touch anything.	Mo bẹru lati fi ọwọ kan ohunkohun.
I deserve to drink.	Mo yẹ lati mu.
I also love the baby.	Mo tun nifẹ ọmọ naa.
I think this works really well.	Mo ro pe eyi n ṣiṣẹ gaan.
No one knows, because no such thing has happened before.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ, nitori ko si iru iyẹn ti ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
It surprised me.	O mu mi iyalẹnu.
Nothing is left for the world.	Ko si ohun ti a fi silẹ fun aye.
It is a feeling of power that changes people’s lives forever.	O jẹ rilara agbara ti o yi igbesi aye eniyan pada lailai.
The same goes for water.	Kanna n lọ fun omi.
I will pay good money for the girl.	Emi yoo san owo ti o dara fun ọmọbirin naa.
If there are no fields, there are no fields.	Ti ko ba si awọn aaye, ko si awọn aaye.
You did not do so.	Iwọ ko ṣe bẹ bẹ.
Again you pay in cash.	Lẹẹkansi o san ni owo.
I know this.	Mo mọ eyi.
Something told him it hadn’t changed.	Nkankan sọ fun u pe ko yipada.
Time is not right.	Akoko ko tọ.
We cannot lose now.	A ko le padanu bayi.
And he was wrong.	Ati pe o ṣe aṣiṣe.
Everyone should be happy.	O yẹ ki inu gbogbo eniyan dun.
Just put yourself first.	O kan fi ara rẹ si akọkọ.
At least look at the work.	O kere ju wo iṣẹ naa.
But there is something more.	Ṣugbọn nkankan diẹ sii wa.
It takes a lot of your time.	O gba akoko pupọ rẹ.
I knew him well for many years ago.	Mo mọ ọ daradara fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun sẹhin.
Maybe you should stay home today.	Boya o yẹ ki o duro si ile loni.
Games rose last year.	Awọn ere dide ni ọdun to kọja.
The father was a tall man.	Baba naa je eniyan ti o ga.
If not, nothing happens.	Ti ko ba si, ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Maybe you want to talk.	Boya o fẹ lati sọrọ.
You can have it, but you don’t.	O le ni, ṣugbọn o ko.
Anyone can play these applications.	Ẹnikẹni le mu awọn ohun elo wọnyi ṣiṣẹ.

Take the letter you wrote or the letter you wrote to you.	Mu lẹta ti o ti kọ tabi lẹta ti o kọ si ọ.
They talk about music.	Wọn sọrọ nipa orin.

That has to be good.	Iyẹn ni lati dara.
The problem is your job.	Iṣoro naa jẹ iṣẹ rẹ.
And when we reached him, he was killed.	Ati pe nigba ti a ba de ọdọ rẹ, o ti pa.
I know this is the way to go.	Mo mọ pe eyi ni ọna.
That is what he did.	Ohun ti o fi se e niyen.
Your brother, he told me.	Arakunrin re, o so fun mi.
People make up history.	Eniyan ṣe soke itan.
Or you do.	Tabi o ṣe.
I have to go talk to them.	Mo ni lati lọ ba wọn sọrọ.
Very good.	O dara pupọ.
I try to love.	Mo gbiyanju lati nifẹ.
But it has not changed yet.	Ṣugbọn ko ti yipada sibẹsibẹ.
In his own way.	Ni ọna tirẹ.
In fact, the doors are also high.	Ni otitọ, awọn ilẹkun tun ga.
No man would do such a thing to a woman.	Ko si ọkunrin kan ti yoo ṣe si obinrin bẹ bẹ.
Think of how good we have been together.	Ronu ti bi o ṣe dara ti a ti wa papọ.
But that can be applied to their advantage now.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn le ṣee lo si anfani wọn ni bayi.
To be loved by someone who will love you.	Lati nifẹ nipasẹ ẹnikan ti yoo nifẹ rẹ.

I put my life in your hands every single day.	Mo fi aye mi si ọwọ rẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ kan.
There must be something we can do.	Ohun kan gbọdọ wa ti a le ṣe.

There is no way you can stay away.	Ko si ọna ti o le duro kuro.
You have to accept that, especially.	O ni lati gba iyẹn, paapaa.
She told him about his work.	O sọ fun u nipa iṣẹ rẹ.
It is not that they are also human.	Kii ṣe pe wọn tun dabi eniyan.
What is your situation.	Kini ipo rẹ.
He did not want to tell.	Ko fe so fun.
Not as easy as it may sound.	Ko rọrun bi o ti le dun.
The sun was hot on his face.	Oorun gbona lori oju rẹ.
We have nothing to go through these pictures.	A ko ni nkankan lati lọ nipasẹ awọn aworan wọnyi.
For many people, this is a big deal.	Fun ọpọlọpọ eniyan, eyi jẹ adehun nla.
I asked him why.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ idi.
They have daughters.	Wọn ni awọn ọmọbirin.

He could not handle the thought.	Ko le mu ero naa.
Some of my stuff is here in the big house.	Diẹ ninu awọn nkan mi wa nibi ni ile nla.
Please get your information to us as soon as possible.	Jọwọ gba alaye rẹ si wa ni kete bi o ti ṣee.
We need players.	A nilo awọn ẹrọ orin.
Just look at the dog making love.	O kan wo aja ti n ṣe ifẹ.
I want to feel something.	Mo fe lati lero nkankan.
It may not be my future car.	O le ma jẹ ọkọ iwaju mi.
But any of these should work.	Ṣugbọn eyikeyi ninu awọn wọnyi yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
So obviously working out the box.	Nitorina o han ni ṣiṣẹ jade apoti.
Will need work.	Yoo nilo iṣẹ.

He can not have.	Ko le ni.
We do not understand it, but it is true.	A ko loye rẹ, ṣugbọn o jẹ otitọ.
You have heard all this before.	O ti gbọ gbogbo eyi tẹlẹ.
The decision was not long.	Ipinnu naa ko pẹ.
I will never forget that moment.	Emi ko ni gbagbe akoko yẹn.
He woke up early and went to work early.	O ji ni kutukutu o si lọ si iṣẹ ni kutukutu.
Three more hours.	Awọn wakati mẹta diẹ sii.
He went for it.	O si lọ fun o.
I hate myself.	Mo korira ara mi.
It will take a few minutes to do.	Yoo gba to iṣẹju diẹ lati ṣe.
I don't have to talk.	Emi ko ni lati sọrọ.
Would you please do this for me?	Jọwọ ṣe iwọ yoo ṣe eyi fun mi?
I don't see how it will bring you back.	Emi ko rii bi yoo ṣe mu ọ pada.
It is a small school.	Ile-iwe kekere ni.
Some words go down.	Awọn ọrọ kan lọ silẹ.
They will tell your husband.	Wọn yoo sọ fun ọkọ rẹ.
We have to stay together.	A ni lati duro papọ.
I would love to hear more.	Emi yoo nifẹ lati gbọ diẹ sii.

He stopped to ask who we were.	O duro lati beere ti a jẹ.
There is no room for us to do anything else.	Ko si aye fun a ṣe ohunkohun miiran.
That is the way our system works.	Iyẹn ni ọna ti eto wa n ṣiṣẹ.
There were few people about.	Nibẹ wà diẹ eniyan nipa.
It's not too sweet, but there is something to go on.	O ni ko ju dun, ṣugbọn nibẹ ni nkankan lati lọ si lori.
These people need to go.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi nilo lati lọ.
I don’t eat anything either.	Emi ko jẹ ohunkohun boya.
But it's not so bad as you feel, man.	Sugbon o ni ko ki buburu bi o ba lero, ọkunrin.
I can not call either.	Emi ko le foonu boya.
The roads will be clear tomorrow.	Awọn opopona yoo mọ ni ọla.
I also don’t know if I did it right.	Emi ko tun mọ boya MO ṣe o tọ.
Water and seasons.	Omi ati awọn akoko.
He left you that.	O fi ọ silẹ pe.
I will not do it.	Emi kii yoo ṣe e.
Move around.	Gbe ni ayika.
Contact me.	Kan si mi.
I was wrong.	Mo ti ni aṣiṣe.
This, in particular, will pass.	Eyi, paapaa, yoo kọja.
But you should not do too much about it.	Ṣugbọn o ko yẹ ki o ṣe ohunkohun pupọ nipa rẹ.
I know how much we need ourselves.	Mo mọ iye ti a nilo ara wa.
I saw it today.	Mo ti ri loni.
The book does not make much sense to me.	Iwe naa ko ni oye pupọ si mi.
It does not matter what the person thinks.	Ko ṣe pataki ohun ti eniyan ro.
This new city was built on the beach.	Ilu tuntun yii ni a kọ si eti okun.
Cats climbed the tree.	Ologbo gun oke igi.
Sometimes you have to work at it.	Nigba miiran o ni lati ṣiṣẹ ni rẹ.
Let me start from this morning.	Jẹ ki n bẹrẹ lati owurọ yii.
That table is no longer needed.	Tabili yẹn ko nilo mọ.
Of course, this is nothing new.	Ni otitọ, eyi kii ṣe nkan tuntun.
You are pretty much just a box with a head.	Ti o ba wa lẹwa Elo o kan kan apoti pẹlu kan ori.
There are so many of them.	Pupọ wa ninu wọn.
If true, some information may be available.	Ti o ba jẹ otitọ, alaye kan le wa.
We are a big family.	A jẹ idile nla kan.
Depends on who worked on them.	Da lori ẹniti o ṣiṣẹ lori wọn.
You must have.	O gbọdọ ni.
Good food, however.	Ounjẹ to dara, sibẹsibẹ.
I have never seen so many books in my life.	Emi ko tii ri ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe ni igbesi aye mi.
I hope.	Mo nireti.
I can't let them change it.	Nko le je ki won yi e pada.
We have to get out there.	A ni lati jade nibẹ.
A fast-moving river has swept across the city.	Odo ti o yara ti yara kọja ilu naa.
It takes a lot of time, but it tends to do.	O gba akoko pupọ, ṣugbọn o duro lati ṣe.
The next day, she thought.	Ni ọjọ miiran, o ronu.
Okay, it works.	O dara, o ṣiṣẹ.
You can get the car.	O le gba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
The money has to be paid.	Owo naa ni lati san.
Let others know how important you feel this is.	Jẹ ki awọn miiran mọ bi o ṣe ṣe pataki ti o lero idi eyi jẹ.
You can not say how things will go.	O ko le sọ bi awọn nkan yoo ṣe lọ.
Such a great thing.	Iru ohun nla bẹ.
One can leave for school or work.	Ẹnikan le lọ kuro fun ile-iwe tabi iṣẹ.
We will find a way to meet like this tomorrow.	A yoo wa ọna lati pade bi eleyi ni ọla.
It may take a few minutes.	O le gba to iṣẹju diẹ.
Poor methods.	Awọn ọna ti ko dara.
It doesn't feel good enough but it feels good.	Ko lero bi o ti to ṣugbọn o dara julọ.
The day was warm and sunny.	Ọjọ naa gbona ati oorun.
Yesterday, we had rain and sleet all day.	Lana, a ni ojo ati ojo ni gbogbo ọjọ.
So we are very sorry for that.	Nitorina a binu gidigidi fun iyẹn.
I am the only one who can help me.	Emi nikan ni o le ran mi lọwọ.
He found the journey difficult.	O ri irin-ajo naa ti o nira.
Give me something.	Wa fun mi ni nkan.
They, in fact, tried to help him.	Wọn, ni otitọ, gbiyanju lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
What moments are these.	Awọn akoko wo ni awọn wọnyi jẹ.
I like to talk to people.	Mo nifẹ lati ba eniyan sọrọ.
You've got a really good idea here.	O ti ni ero ti o dara gaan nibi.
People do not need to know.	Eniyan ko nilo lati mọ.
It looks like it but.	O dabi rẹ ṣugbọn.
Mostly it is so.	Pupọ julọ o jẹ bẹ.
Believe in yourself and know that you have what it takes.	Gbagbọ ninu ara rẹ ki o mọ pe o ni ohun ti o nilo.
I can read them all, from one to another.	Mo le ka gbogbo wọn, lati ọkan si ọkan.
Just get it.	O kan gba.
That has never happened before.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
We will always talk football.	Nigbagbogbo a yoo sọrọ bọọlu.
Maybe you like money.	Boya o fẹran owo.
Have to accept that.	Ni lati gba pe.
We will help you with that.	A yoo ran ọ lọwọ pẹlu iyẹn.
Her brother is getting married.	Arakunrin re n se igbeyawo.
So you are not going to get paid.	Nitorina o jẹ pe iwọ kii yoo gba owo.
I saw him this morning at breakfast.	Mo ti ri i ni owurọ yi ni ounjẹ owurọ.
She is happy.	Inu re dun o.
Young people often take advantage of their parents.	Awọn ọdọ nigbagbogbo lo anfani awọn obi wọn.
In this report.	Ninu iroyin yii.
He was a very good student and helped me with the class.	O jẹ ọmọ ile-iwe ti o dara pupọ o si ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi pẹlu kilasi naa.
I told you where.	Mo ti sọ fun ọ nibo.
He left before lunch time.	O kuro ṣaaju akoko ounjẹ ọsan.
So you have planned.	Nitorina o ti gbero.
It can often be found at the train station.	Nigbagbogbo a le rii ni ibudo ọkọ oju irin.
He’s tall, not his age, maybe a few years older.	O ga, kii ṣe ọjọ ori rẹ, boya ọdun diẹ dagba.
These are pictures.	Awon aworan niyen.
The people around here love to eat.	Awọn eniyan ni ayika nibi nifẹ lati jẹun.
They have a lot to worry about.	Wọn ni ọpọlọpọ lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
That doesn’t make them worthy of our site.	Iyẹn ko jẹ ki wọn yẹ fun aaye wa.
I believe your brother happened.	Mo gbagbọ pe arakunrin rẹ ni o ṣẹlẹ.
That is not the case at all.	Kii ṣe iyẹn rara.
We can include.	A le pẹlu.
Now is not the time to say, not until we know more.	Bayi kii ṣe akoko lati sọ, kii ṣe titi ti a fi mọ diẹ sii.
Don't let them sell you.	Maṣe jẹ ki wọn ta ọ.
I just don’t feel it anymore.	Mo kan ko rilara rẹ pupọ mọ.
They found two things in the field.	Wọn ri awọn nkan meji ni aaye.
You have to go from here.	O ni lati lọ lati ibi.
You have to say for a while to run.	O ni lati sọ fun igba lati ṣiṣe.
My last night.	Mi kẹhin alẹ.
It makes me work a little more.	O jẹ ki n ṣiṣẹ diẹ diẹ sii.
But there is no time now.	Ṣugbọn ko si akoko ni bayi.
I must say that they left a lot to be desired.	Mo gbọdọ sọ pe wọn fi pupọ silẹ lati fẹ.
He did not change the vehicle.	Ko yi ọkọ.
We have known each other's names for a long time.	A ti mọ orukọ ara wa fun igba pipẹ.
I just love it.	Mo kan nifẹ rẹ.
After returning home, he went for a bath.	Lẹhin ti o pada si ile, o lọ fun wẹ.
You can write your opinion if you like them or not.	O le kọ ero rẹ ti o ba fẹran wọn tabi rara.
Again, not so good.	Lẹẹkansi, ko ki dara.
He got up from his chair.	O dide lori ijoko rẹ.
I took off after him.	Mo mu kuro lẹhin rẹ.
Thus the long summer days draw.	Bayi ni gun ooru ọjọ fa.
Which brings us to the purpose of this thing.	Eyi ti o mu wa si idi ti nkan yii.
I still remember it.	Mo tun ranti rẹ.
Now it has grown to be more than that.	Bayi o ti dagba lati jẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
I expect nothing less.	Mo reti ohunkohun kere.
Obviously, this is not true.	O han ni, eyi kii ṣe otitọ.
He lives alone.	O ngbe nikan.
They will not be repeated here.	Won yoo wa ko le tun nibi.
I quickly learned my lesson.	Mo yara kọ ẹkọ mi.
You like it or you don't like it.	Iwọ fẹran rẹ tabi korira rẹ.
Children adopted from the local community.	Awọn ọmọ ti a gba lati agbegbe agbegbe.
However, he had told them.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ti sọ fun wọn.
That is why we have broken the law.	Eyi ni idi ti a fi kọja ofin naa.
Okay, you made a mistake.	O dara, o ṣe aṣiṣe.
Things are as bad as they are.	Awọn nkan jẹ buburu to bi wọn ṣe jẹ.
Just almost done.	O kan fẹrẹ ṣe.
Anyone can work.	Ẹnikẹni le ṣe iṣẹ.
This rule works.	Ofin yii n ṣiṣẹ.
They can use a new one of that too.	Wọn le lo ọkan tuntun ti iyẹn paapaa.
I love bread, but bread doesn’t like me.	Mo nifẹ akara, ṣugbọn akara ko fẹran mi.
A place like ours.	Aaye kan bi wa.
And we need it here.	Ati pe a nilo rẹ nibi.
But no, of course not.	Ṣugbọn rara, dajudaju kii ṣe iyẹn.
That is how we buy them.	Bi a ti n ra won niyen.
That's what our money does.	Ohun ti owo wa ṣe niyẹn.
Her mother is simple about it.	Iya rẹ rọrun nipa rẹ.
So it did for long days.	Nitorina o ṣe fun awọn ọjọ pipẹ.
It takes a lot of your planning.	O gba pupọ ninu eto rẹ.
I'm glad you're here.	Inu mi dun pe o wa nibi.
That makes me angry.	Iyẹn binu mi.
They will only hurt if they go down.	Wọn yoo ṣe ipalara nikan ti wọn ba lọ silẹ.
I do not deserve to be here at all.	Emi ko yẹ lati wa nibi rara.
They want to get back on track.	Wọn fẹ gba pada ni ọna ti o pada.
I do not just say that because he is my best friend.	Emi ko kan sọ iyẹn nitori pe o jẹ ọrẹ mi to dara julọ.
I just got there.	Mo kan ni nibẹ.
You do not know your mistake.	O ko mọ aṣiṣe rẹ.
Below are some pictures from the lunch.	Ni isalẹ wa awọn aworan diẹ lati ọsan.
What more can you say.	Kini diẹ sii le sọ.
She said her son was happy to be back in school.	O sọ pe inu ọmọ rẹ dun lati pada si ile-iwe.
They talk with you and yourself.	Wọn sọ pẹlu rẹ ati funrararẹ.
Cars like wisdom are there.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ bi ọgbọn wa nibẹ.
I have to play the game.	Mo ni lati ṣe ere naa.
But we had a great time wrong.	Ṣugbọn a ni akoko nla kan ti ko tọ.
Wear warm clothes.	Wọ aṣọ ti o gbona diẹ.
You think this is a good thing.	O ro pe eyi jẹ ohun ti o dara.
It will take only a few words.	Yoo gba awọn ọrọ kekere diẹ nikan.
Now you say no.	Bayi o sọ ko.
Many men used it for the job.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkunrin lo fun iṣẹ naa.
It doesn’t make you understand intelligently, you know.	Ko jẹ ki o dun ni oye, o mọ.
There are two groups to it.	Awọn ẹgbẹ meji wa si rẹ.
Essentially it doesn’t seem to end.	Ni pataki o dabi pe ko pari.
It doesn't matter.	Ko ṣe pataki to.
My thoughts on the big brother.	Awọn ero mi lori arakunrin nla.
You are my best friend.	Iwọ ni ọrẹ mi to dara julọ.
We want to be able to say no.	A fẹ lati ni anfani lati sọ rara.
Someone will leave.	Ẹnikan yoo lọ kuro.
Will do this again.	Yoo tun ṣe eyi lẹẹkansi.
I am sure we are in a house.	O da mi loju pe a wa ninu ile kan.
I will not get in the way.	Emi kii yoo gba ni ọna.
The best way to learn is to ask a few questions.	Ọna ti o dara julọ lati kọ ẹkọ ni lati beere awọn ibeere diẹ.
But it can make the situation better.	Ṣugbọn o le jẹ ki ipo naa dara.
You know, whatever you want to do, it can be done here.	O mọ, ohunkohun ti o fẹ lati ṣe, o le ṣee ṣe nibi.
He lives from hand to mouth.	O ngbe lati ọwọ de ẹnu.
Will there be more buses?	Ṣe ọkọ akero yoo wa diẹ sii nigbagbogbo?
They will be available this time as well.	Wọn yoo wa wa ni akoko yii pẹlu.
I could not understand why he hired me.	Emi ko le loye idi ti o fi gba mi ni iṣẹ.
That depends on what you mean.	Iyẹn da lori ohun ti o tumọ si.
I would take something from other kids.	Emi yoo gba nkan lọwọ awọn ọmọde miiran.
I'll just call the police.	Emi yoo kan pe ọlọpa.
Now someone wants to burn the whole thing.	Bayi ẹnikan fẹ lati sun gbogbo nkan naa.
His hand did not go through the table, at least.	Ọwọ rẹ ko lọ nipasẹ tabili, o kere ju.
And this will give me a lot of trouble.	Ati pe eyi yoo fun mi ni wahala pupọ.
You are right.	O ti tọ si.
Possibly much more than that.	O ṣee ṣe pupọ diẹ sii ju.
Try both to find the one you like.	Gbiyanju awọn mejeeji lati rii eyi ti o fẹ.
All was as it should be.	Gbogbo wà bi o ti yẹ.
Some good.	Diẹ ninu awọn dara.
Money is dead.	Owo ti ku.
In a few minutes, he arrived at school.	Ni iṣẹju diẹ, o de ile-iwe.
But he did not know that he was gone.	Ṣugbọn ko mọ pe o ti lọ.
I'm just coming home.	Mo kan n bọ si ile.
The fire is out.	Ina ti jade.
And yet it annoys me.	Ati sibẹsibẹ o binu mi.
The best thing I have ever done for myself.	Ohun ti o dara julọ ti Mo ti ṣe fun ara mi.
I can not begin to tell you specifically what you did.	Emi ko le bẹrẹ lati sọ fun ọ pataki ohun ti o ṣe.
They take the law into their own hands.	Wọn gba ofin si ọwọ ara wọn.
I should work them out again by the next meeting.	Mo yẹ ki wọn tun ṣiṣẹ lẹẹkansi nipasẹ ipade ti nbọ.
Sit back and close your eyes.	Joko pada ki o pa oju rẹ mọ.
After that night, he never returned to that restaurant.	Lẹhin alẹ yẹn, ko pada si ile ounjẹ yẹn rara.
But that is not long enough.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ti pẹ to.
He could not have closed his eyes for a minute or two.	Ko le ti di oju rẹ fun iṣẹju kan tabi meji.
It looks like a fire has been extinguished or something.	O dabi pe ina kan ti pa tabi nkankan.
People know it.	Eniyan mọ o.
I fear this will happen.	Mo bẹru pe eyi yoo ṣẹlẹ.
I have some bad news.	Mo ni diẹ ninu awọn iroyin buburu.
She's happy to talk.	O dun lati sọrọ.
These books look great.	Awọn iwe wọnyi dabi nla.
It may be true.	O le jẹ otitọ.
Okay, now is the time for bed.	O dara, akoko fun ibusun ni bayi.
This is a very important book.	Eyi jẹ iwe pataki pupọ.
He spent more time with her lately.	O lo akoko diẹ sii pẹlu rẹ laipẹ.
I left my foot.	Mo fi ẹsẹ mi silẹ.
Whose life would you like to live?	Igbesi aye tani iwọ yoo fẹ lati gbe?
Which is why we will never do it again.	Ti o jẹ idi ti a ko ni tun ṣe lẹẹkansi.
Her hair is too long for this outfit.	Irun rẹ ti gun ju fun aṣọ yii.
Do not write anything on this page.	Ma ko ohunkohun lori iwe yi.
Last year, we lost that game.	Ni ọdun to kọja, a padanu ere yẹn.
And that is one of the most beautiful things.	Ati awọn ti o jẹ ọkan ninu awọn julọ lẹwa ohun.
It will be there.	O yoo wa nibẹ.
But do nothing.	Ṣugbọn maṣe ṣe ohunkohun.
I let you do whatever you want with me.	Mo jẹ ki o ṣe ohunkohun ti o fẹ si mi.
Do not store any pictures in it.	Maṣe tọju awọn aworan eyikeyi ninu rẹ.
Any materials and images can be used.	Eyikeyi awọn ohun elo ati awọn aworan le ṣee lo.
So who knows.	Nitorina tani o mọ.
The work did not work.	Iṣẹ naa ko ṣe.
You know how to add music.	O mọ bi o ṣe le fi orin kun.
But that does not make the idea right or wrong.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko jẹ ki ero naa tọ tabi aṣiṣe.
They are given everything.	Won ni won fi fun ohun gbogbo.
However, not everyone is in agreement.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan ni adehun.
All the other kids out there were very scared about it.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọ miiran ti o wa nibẹ ni o bẹru pupọ nipa rẹ.
The body on it is amazing.	Ara lori rẹ jẹ iyanu.
By now, it is too late.	Ni bayi, o ti pẹ ju.
I do not want anyone to see this.	Emi ko fẹ ki ẹnikẹni ri eyi.
But he decided.	Ṣugbọn o pinnu.
But it is possible.	Sugbon o ṣee ṣe.
Call me when you receive this.	Pe mi nigbati o ba gba eyi.
This is a hard thing.	Eyi jẹ nkan lile.
But this is good for him.	Ṣugbọn eyi dara fun u.
Good for everyone involved.	O dara fun gbogbo eniyan ti o kan.
It will take you three days.	Yoo gba ọ ni ọjọ mẹta.
But that is not a problem.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe iṣoro.
It took me away from the whole thing.	O mu mi kuro ni gbogbo nkan naa.
Their team lost the game, but they also played.	Ẹgbẹ wọn padanu ere naa, ṣugbọn wọn tun dun.
But the trees move.	Ṣugbọn awọn igi gbe.
But give it a try.	Sugbon fun o kan gbiyanju.
It’s time to let it go.	O to akoko lati jẹ ki o lọ.
Marriage is a.	Igbeyawo je a.
Go to work, he said.	Lọ si iṣẹ, o sọ.
All was as it always has been.	Gbogbo wà bi o ti nigbagbogbo wà.
I know that is important to you.	Mo mọ pe iyẹn ṣe pataki fun ọ.
Time is up.	Akoko ti pari.
Get it from someone you know.	Gba lọwọ ẹnikan ti o mọ.
See the thing here.	Wo nkan naa nibi.
Your firm stated why yesterday.	Rẹ duro so idi lana.
Many girls have trouble seeing me as a person.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọbirin ni iṣoro ri mi bi eniyan.
He was here a few minutes ago.	O wa nibi ni iṣẹju diẹ sẹhin.
Do not attempt to contact.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati kan si.
You can handle this.	O le mu eyi.
I think it came to me.	Mo ro pe o wa si mi.
Get your money up.	Gba owo rẹ soke.

Not more than a year.	Ko si ju ọdun kan lọ.
Cannot have both.	Ko le ni awọn mejeeji.

Take the bus to the station.	Gba ọkọ akero lọ si ibudo.

It was his decision.	O jẹ ipinnu rẹ.

We should not be afraid.	A ko yẹ ki o bẹru.
It's just wood, they say.	Igi nikan ni, wọn sọ.
You have to open it.	O ni lati ṣii si.
This is the way to the boat.	Eyi ni ọna lati lọ si oju omi.
This is their way.	Eyi ni ọna wọn.
He was killed before they could be captured.	O ti pa a ṣaaju ki wọn to gba wọn.
He seemed intelligent.	O dabi enipe oye.
Maybe we should take a few days off.	Boya o yẹ ki a gba isinmi ọjọ diẹ.
Do this more often.	Ṣe eyi diẹ sii nigbagbogbo.
They look down at them.	Wọn wo isalẹ wọn.
This city has something for everyone.	Ilu yi ni nkankan fun gbogbo eniyan.
I'm glad you like them.	Inu mi dun pe o fẹran wọn.
You also want to get out.	O tun fẹ lati jade.
There is a game.	Ere kan kan wa.
You haven't seen it well in some time.	O ti ko ri rẹ daradara ni diẹ ninu awọn akoko.
He did not want me or a woman at all.	Ko fe emi tabi obinrin rara.
He made a mistake again.	O tun ṣe aṣiṣe lẹẹkansi.
I hope you can sleep early today.	Mo nireti pe o le sun ni kutukutu loni.
The water turned solid.	Omi yipada si ri to.
Games made by us and for us.	Awọn ere ṣe nipasẹ wa ati fun wa.
I did nothing against them.	Emi ko ṣe nkankan si wọn.
It stays in.	O duro ninu.
But for you only.	Sugbon fun o nikan.
You need to have information about the tests.	O nilo lati ni alaye nipa awọn idanwo.
The world is so sweet.	Aye ti dun to.
Everywhere, there are people.	Nibi gbogbo, awọn eniyan wa.
I don't think it's over.	Emi ko ro pe o ti pari.
I did not break into the room.	Emi ko ya sinu yara.
The room is as it was left.	Yara naa jẹ bi o ti fi silẹ.
You will do so in the next few months.	Iwọ yoo ṣe ni awọn oṣu diẹ ti nbọ.
Beautiful wife.	Iyawo lẹwa.
Well, maybe they understood, and maybe they didn't.	O dara, boya wọn loye, ati boya wọn ko ṣe.
We need some help for these girls.	A nilo iranlọwọ diẹ fun awọn ọmọbirin wọnyi.
He spent most of his life alone.	O lo pupọ julọ igbesi aye rẹ nikan.
Now do something about it.	Bayi ṣe nkankan nipa rẹ.
And it worked.	Ati pe o ṣiṣẹ.
I am in a meeting.	Mo wa ninu ipade kan.
I am going to visit a friend.	Emi yoo lọ ṣabẹwo si ọrẹ kan.
At some point, you will need to add water.	Ni aaye kan, iwọ yoo nilo lati fi omi kun.
There was nothing else on it that was about them.	Ko si ohun miiran lori rẹ ti o wà nipa wọn.
It's in the past.	O ni ni igba atijọ.
Where anything can happen.	Ibi ti ohunkohun le ṣẹlẹ.
Not now he is there.	Kii ṣe bayi o wa nibẹ.
There is no special point.	Ko si aaye ti o ṣe pataki.
This is not a vacation area.	Eyi kii ṣe agbegbe isinmi.
I love it so much, really.	Mo nifẹ rẹ pupọ, ni otitọ.
It works there.	O ṣiṣẹ nibẹ.
This is something to work on in the future.	Eyi jẹ nkan lati ṣiṣẹ ni ọjọ iwaju.
I just killed it.	Mo ti pa a nikan.
The power is great.	Agbara naa jẹ nla.
Some say it is not good for small children.	Diẹ ninu awọn sọ pe ko dara fun awọn ọmọde kekere.
The rain ended several weeks early.	Ojo naa pari ni ọsẹ pupọ ni kutukutu.
They carried it out first.	Wọn gbe e jade ni akọkọ.
Your work will be completed soon.	Iṣẹ rẹ yoo pari laipẹ.
To find the right thing.	Lati wa ohun ti o tọ si.
The first area is hard.	Agbegbe akọkọ jẹ lile.
We are not physically in one seat.	A kii ṣe ara ni ijoko kan.
That has to be.	Iyẹn ni lati jẹ.
She lost a lot of men that day.	O padanu ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkunrin ni ọjọ yẹn.
Nothing here for him.	Ko si nkankan nibi fun u.
If the box is too long, keep it small.	Ti apoti ba gun ju, jẹ ki o kere.
It will not open.	Kii yoo ṣii.
They look good.	Wọn wo daradara.
You always know where you are.	O nigbagbogbo mọ ibi ti o wa.
He did not tell her anything.	Ko so fun u nkankan.
Now it should all work as it should.	Bayi gbogbo rẹ yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ bi o ti yẹ.
It has come a long way.	O ti wa ni ọna pipẹ.
And that makes some sense.	Ati awọn ti o mu diẹ ninu awọn ori.
And the time is.	Ati awọn akoko ni.
It will not be easy.	Kii yoo rọrun.
Take them out of town.	Mu wọn jade kuro ni ilu.
I just hate them.	Mo kan korira wọn.
I feel like they don’t.	Mo ni rilara pe wọn ko ṣe.
You can watch with your friends.	O le wo pẹlu awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
It will not help.	Ko ni ṣe iranlọwọ.
However, two years ago, we had the same problem.	Sibẹsibẹ, ni ọdun meji sẹhin, a ni iṣoro kanna.
But he was there.	Sugbon o ti wa nibẹ.
Can you find it?	Ṣe o le rii?
Other reasons may be given.	Awọn idi miiran le ṣee fun.
I got out of the way.	Mo jade kuro ni ọna.
In most cases, it goes away on its own.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba, o lọ kuro lori ara rẹ.
The other is someone you would never have suspected.	Awọn miiran jẹ ẹnikan ti o yoo ko ti fura.
She put her eyes into yours.	O fi oju rẹ sinu tirẹ.
But we probably shouldn’t.	Sugbon a jasi ko yẹ.
Sometimes other things happen.	Nigba miiran awọn nkan miiran n ṣẹlẹ.
You will have to use all the hair.	Iwọ yoo ni lati lo gbogbo irun.
They refuse to withdraw.	Wọn kọ lati yọ kuro.
You can't buy it.	O ko le ṣe ifẹ si i.
As you can see, that did not happen.	Bi o ti le rii, iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ.
No matter where you come from, and how you get lost.	Ko si ibi ti o ba wa lati, ati bi o ti padanu.
Leave a seat on your nightstand or on your desk.	Fi ijoko silẹ lori ibi alẹ rẹ tabi lori tabili rẹ.
You have to get yourself out of it.	O ni lati yọ ara rẹ kuro ninu rẹ.
They never do it again.	Wọn ko tun ṣe lẹẹkansi.
The story did not take long.	Itan naa ko gba akoko pipẹ.
No good news, no bad news.	Ko si iroyin ti o dara, ko si iroyin buburu.
He was a married man again.	O jẹ ọkunrin ti o ni iyawo meji lẹẹkansi.
Nothing else was added.	Ko si ohun miiran ti a fi kun.
He said he was talking about himself, not a friend.	O sọ pe o n sọrọ nipa ararẹ, kii ṣe ọrẹ kan.
It surprised my eyes.	O ya oju mi.
You are not the only one.	Iwọ kii ṣe ojo nikan.
You should never go out again.	O yẹ ki o ko jade lẹẹkansi.
Take a good, you know.	Ya kan ti o dara, o mọ.
If anything changes, tell me when you call tonight.	Ti ohunkohun ba yipada, sọ fun mi nigbati o ba pe ni alẹ oni.
It has been around forever.	O ti wa ni ayika lailai.
You just want to use it sometimes during the test.	O kan fẹ lati lo nigba miiran nigba idanwo.
The sun rose upon the water.	Oorun dide lori omi.
Let me try to take this thing seriously.	Jẹ ki n gbiyanju lati mu nkan yii ni pataki.
With simple pictures.	Pẹlu awọn aworan ti o rọrun.
They never left cars.	Wọn ko fi awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ silẹ rara.
They will not stand by anything to get what they want.	Wọn kii yoo duro ni ohunkohun lati gba ohun ti wọn fẹ.
I have never been there before today.	Emi ko ti wa nibẹ ṣaaju ki o to loni.
To think before you act.	Lati ronu ṣaaju ki o to ṣe.
Don’t ignore it.	Maṣe ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
Find them and read them.	Wa wọn ki o ka wọn.
Water is constantly coming out of the body.	Omi n jade ninu ara nigbagbogbo.
Your ability to read the game is important.	Agbara rẹ lati ka ere naa ṣe pataki.
I will use them again.	Emi yoo tun lo wọn lẹẹkansi.
And that wisdom works.	Ati pe ọgbọn naa ṣiṣẹ.
Not even way back.	Ko paapaa ọna pada.
I should just let it go.	Mo ti yẹ ki o kan jẹ ki o lọ.
I don’t think you like it very much.	Emi ko ro pe o fẹran rẹ pupọ.
I don't see how we can do it.	Emi ko rii bi a ṣe le ṣe.
So good now.	Nitorina o dara ni bayi.
An area has been built there.	A ti kọ agbegbe kan nibẹ.
I'm sorry, too.	Emi naa binu, paapaa.
Sorry it doesn't happen.	Ma binu ko ma ṣẹlẹ.
The car is the only material.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ jẹ ohun elo nikan.
He let his head move, his face changed.	O jẹ ki ori rẹ gbe, oju rẹ yipada.
It was time for him to ask her.	O to akoko fun u lati beere lọwọ rẹ.
So we should not be able to.	Nitorina ko yẹ ki a ni anfani lati.
She loves to work in the garden.	O nifẹ lati ṣiṣẹ ninu ọgba.
He seemed to love it.	O dabi enipe o nifẹ rẹ.
It was great for him to see that.	O jẹ nla fun u lati rii iyẹn.
This time, we also asked ourselves two questions.	Ni akoko yii, a tun beere ara wa ni ibeere meji.
No one expects him to come back the way he is now.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o nireti pe yoo pada wa ni ọna ti o wa ni bayi.
He looked again.	O tun wo.
We can all see that this is a mistake.	Gbogbo wa le rii pe eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
So, what will you do?	Nitorina, kini iwọ yoo ṣe?
And there it is.	Ati pe o wa.
None of the three are on the job.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn mẹta ti o wa lori iṣẹ.
That will still have something to do with when this happens.	Ti o si tun yoo ni nkankan lati se pẹlu nigbati yi ṣẹlẹ.
My hands are clean.	Ọwọ mi mọ.
His whole life was destined for him.	Gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ ni a ti pinnu fun u.
Where would you like to go.	Ibi ti yoo fẹ lati lọ.
Now let me speak out.	Bayi jẹ ki n sọrọ jade.
This picture is for my mother.	Aworan yi wa fun iya mi.
Look at their faces.	Wo oju wọn.
But he did not stop there.	Ṣugbọn ko duro nibẹ.
He wants both.	O fe awon mejeeji.
It's outside.	O wa ni ita.
Made to get your attention.	Ti ṣe lati gba akiyesi rẹ.
They are not just for me.	Wọn kii ṣe fun mi nikan.
Or they must.	Tabi wọn gbọdọ.
Keep yourself safe.	Pa ara rẹ mọ.
He’s moving my stuff.	O n gbe awọn nkan mi lọ.
It may not work that way.	O le ma ṣiṣẹ ni ọna yẹn.
I don’t like to learn for myself.	Emi ko nifẹ lati kọ ẹkọ fun ara mi.
With two children and a husband.	Pẹlu awọn ọmọ meji ati ọkọ kan.
This is not something to try at home.	Eyi kii ṣe nkan lati gbiyanju ni ile.
He could not, could not reach the river.	Ko le, ko le de odo.
Three hours late.	Wakati mẹta pẹ.
It is very helpful.	O jẹ iranlọwọ pupọ.
I made this possible.	Mo ṣe eyi ṣee ṣe.
We may not.	A le ma ṣe.
Or their eyes.	Tabi oju wọn.
It should be my brother.	O yẹ ki o jẹ arakunrin mi.
I went to see what was happening.	Mo ti lọ lati wo ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
No, no one does.	Rara, ẹnikan ko ṣe.
That means you have to work at home.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe o ni lati ṣiṣẹ ni ile.
You have come to that.	O ti de si iyẹn.
Would have liked to see more of the law firm.	Yoo ti fẹ lati ri diẹ sii ti ile-iṣẹ ofin.
I have tried everywhere.	Mo ti gbiyanju nibi gbogbo.
It comes from one side to the other and takes time.	O wa lati ẹgbẹ kan si ẹgbẹ miiran ati pe o gba akoko.
You did well.	O ṣe daradara.
If you don’t believe me, come along.	Ti o ko ba gbagbọ mi, wa pẹlu.
There is nothing to do now.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣe ni bayi.
To talk about it.	Lati sọrọ nipa rẹ.
They are not really my parents.	Wọn kii ṣe awọn obi mi gaan.
They are like you and me.	Wọn dabi iwọ ati emi.
Great thing, though.	Ohun nla, paapaa.
It was a wonderful day.	O jẹ ọjọ ti o dara julọ.
He will worry.	Oun yoo ṣe aniyan.
Keep their eyes on you.	Pa oju wọn mọ ọ.
So you are in these games too.	Nitorina o wa ninu awọn ere wọnyi paapaa.
One by one, people fell asleep.	Ọkan nipa ọkan, eniyan sun oorun.
It is very hopeful for me.	O nireti pupọ fun mi.
She seemed happy.	O dabi enipe inu rẹ dun.
He was dead, by the way.	O ti ku, nipasẹ ọna.
You can also expect amazing working conditions.	O tun le nireti awọn ipo iṣẹ iyanu.
But that’s not too much.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe pupọ pupọ.
All this.	Gbogbo eyi.
Will be here.	Yoo wa nibi.
But you have to get back to work.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati pada si iṣẹ naa.
Or maybe not at all.	Tabi boya kii ṣe iyẹn rara.
Inside, however, there is a lot of work to be done.	Ninu inu, sibẹsibẹ, ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ wa lati ṣe.
We look at each other.	A wo ara wa.
That's it.	Iyẹn ṣe.
No one is watching.	Ko si ẹnikan ti n wo.
He called the doctor.	O pe dokita naa.
But you can.	Ṣugbọn o le ṣe.
To be remembered.	Lati ti ranti.
But, in reality, it is not good.	Ṣugbọn, ni otitọ, ko dara.
I did not plan it.	Emi ko gbero rẹ.
You have your menstrual period this morning.	O ni nkan oṣu rẹ ni owurọ yi.
We are not human.	A ko ni eniyan.
I know what it is to try something great.	Mo mọ kini o jẹ lati gbiyanju nkan nla.
He slept in a room upstairs.	O sun ninu yara kan ni oke.
It's very simple.	O rọrun pupọ.
Which more often than not is true.	Eyi ti diẹ sii ju igba kii ṣe otitọ.
The state of things is nothing new.	Ipo ti awọn nkan ko jẹ nkan tuntun.
Not even have to say.	Ko paapaa ni lati sọ.
Most importantly, it is growing within itself.	Ni pataki julọ, o n dagba sinu ara rẹ.
We have changed in the way we should.	A ti yipada ni ọna ti o yẹ ki a ṣe.
Many of us have gone to school together.	Pupọ wa ti lọ si ile-iwe papọ.
They are amazing and special.	Wọn jẹ awọn ohun iyanu ati pataki.
It’s because it works.	O jẹ nitori pe o ṣiṣẹ.
It will end.	Yoo pari.
We will contact.	A yoo kan si.
You must wear this dress at all times.	O gbọdọ wọ aṣọ yii ni gbogbo igba.
You should know such a thing.	O yẹ ki o mọ iru nkan bẹẹ.
He did not live with the desire to demolish the house.	O ko gbe pẹlu ifẹ lati fa ile naa silẹ.
You never know what people might learn about themselves through it.	O ko mọ ohun ti eniyan le kọ nipa ara wọn nipasẹ rẹ.
He has a lot of friends.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ.
Any information would be great.	Eyikeyi alaye yoo jẹ nla.
It made me laugh.	O mu mi rẹrin.
He started and told me to jump in.	O bẹrẹ o si sọ fun mi lati fo sinu.
The young mother arrives home late.	Iya odo de ile pẹ.
Many houses were built at that time.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile ni a kọ ni akoko yẹn.
I want it to be yours.	Mo fẹ ki o jẹ tirẹ.
What will happen to the city is my concern.	Ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ si ilu naa ni aniyan mi.
If you can tell him who he is.	Ti o ba le sọ fun u ẹniti o jẹ.
It was not enough.	O je ko o to.
He thought he was high.	O ro pe o ga.
Wait, that's only two.	Duro, iyẹn jẹ meji nikan.
Either way, no one has.	Ni ọna kan, ko si ọkan ti o ni.
And there is no place to run.	Ati pe ko si aaye lati ṣiṣe.
We may have burned your house.	A le ti sun ile rẹ.
We just have to try.	A kan ni lati gbiyanju.
You know what is right and what is wrong.	O mọ ohun ti o tọ ati ohun ti ko tọ.
Someone will see you, and remember you.	Ẹnikan yoo ri ọ, ki o si ranti rẹ.
That is not your way at all.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ọna rẹ rara.
To change the world.	Lati yi pada si aye.
I do not know how they did.	Emi ko mọ bi wọn ṣe ṣe.
I asked you why.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ idi ti o fi ṣe.
It has changed.	O ti yipada.
It will not work for your requirements.	Kii yoo ṣiṣẹ fun awọn ibeere rẹ.
His job is not to make decisions for him.	Iṣẹ rẹ kii ṣe lati ṣe awọn ipinnu fun u.
Everything worked great.	Ohun gbogbo ti ṣiṣẹ nla.
So put something out there.	Nitorina gbe nkan jade nibẹ.
You are too young to know anything about it.	O ti wa kere ju lati mọ ohunkohun nipa rẹ.
They agree.	Wọn gba.
She has a very high opinion of herself.	O ni ero giga pupọ nipa ara rẹ.
Many people were arrested.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni wọn mu.
I must have that ability.	Mo gbọdọ ni agbara yẹn.
Find out how to use it.	Wa bi o ṣe le lo.
I told him not to call me anymore.	Mo ti so fun u ko pe mi mọ.
We stopped for a few minutes.	A duro fun iṣẹju diẹ.
We change every week.	A yipada ni gbogbo ọsẹ.
I promise you, they can drink.	Mo ṣe ileri fun ọ, wọn le mu.
I will give it a good name.	Emi yoo fun ni orukọ ti o dara julọ.
You will come out.	Iwọ yoo jade.
It is what you used to.	O jẹ ohun ti o lo lati.
Now he is angry.	Bayi o binu.
It is very important to keep people's promises.	O ṣe pataki pupọ lati pa awọn ileri eniyan mọ.
They should live a good life.	Wọn yẹ ki o gbe igbesi aye ti o dara.
Nothing came out.	Ko si ohun ti jade.
You will be easier.	Iwọ yoo rọrun.
However, there is still work to be done.	Sibẹsibẹ, iṣẹ iwaju tun wa.
I always use the word.	Mo nigbagbogbo lo ọrọ naa nigbagbogbo.
He wanted to live with her for two years.	O fẹ lati gbe pẹlu rẹ fun ọdun meji.
Don't let anyone tell you who you are.	Maṣe jẹ ki ẹnikẹni sọ ẹni ti o jẹ fun ọ.
But you know a lot.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pupọ.
He did not tell us anything.	Ko sọ ohunkohun fun wa.
Soon everyone will see even more.	Laipẹ gbogbo eniyan yoo rii paapaa.
One of her sisters is getting married tomorrow.	Ọkan ninu awọn arabinrin rẹ n ṣe igbeyawo ni ọla.
Eat your food.	Je ounjẹ rẹ.
Baby feet are beautiful.	Awọn ẹsẹ ọmọ jẹ lẹwa.
Tell us where you are jumping.	Sọ fun wa nibo ni o ti n fo.
If you would like help, please let us know.	Ti o ba fẹ ran, jọwọ jẹ ki a mọ.
It will not be the last of course.	Kii yoo jẹ kẹhin ti dajudaju.
I can ask you for information.	Mo le beere lọwọ rẹ fun alaye.
Now, open your eyes.	Bayi, ṣii oju rẹ.
He looked at the city.	O wo ilu naa.
I build a life.	Mo kọ igbesi aye kan.
This is a gift.	Eyi jẹ ẹbun kan.
And you do not know about these things.	Ati pe o ko mọ nipa nkan wọnyi.
It happened, it was there.	O ṣẹlẹ, o wa nibẹ.
Maybe that doesn’t surprise you.	Boya iyẹn ko ṣe ohun iyanu fun ọ.
These things are not true.	Awọn nkan wọnyi kii ṣe otitọ.
He did not try to know anyone.	Ko gbiyanju lati mọ ẹnikẹni.
I don’t have to believe.	Emi ko ni lati gbagbọ.
That's as simple as that.	Iyẹn rọrun bi iyẹn.
But this situation is wrong.	Ṣugbọn ipo yii jẹ aṣiṣe.
We are brothers.	Arakunrin ni wa.
It's you players.	O jẹ ti o awọn ẹrọ orin.
Not great, not even good.	Ko ṣe nla, paapaa ko dara.
Children learn a lot in school.	Awọn ọmọde kọ ẹkọ pupọ ni ile-iwe.
But they did not have enough money then.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko ni owo to nigba naa.
But that will not happen.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Let's just talk.	Jẹ ki a kan sọrọ.
I mean, a little bit, okay.	Mo tumọ si, diẹ diẹ, dara.
That man is very much like you.	Ọkunrin yẹn dabi rẹ pupọ.
I just did something that worked for me and my family.	Mo kan ṣe ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ fun emi ati idile mi.
Both are dead.	Awon mejeeji ti ku.
You don't use it anymore.	O ko lo fun u mọ.
Probably nothing.	O jasi ohunkohun.
Impossible, simple as that.	Ko le ṣee ṣe, rọrun bi iyẹn.
But the train did not go.	Ṣugbọn ọkọ oju irin naa ko lọ.
That does two things.	Iyẹn ṣe ohun meji.
Only this time he is stronger.	Nikan ni akoko yii o ni okun sii.
Take a book out of your pocket.	Mu iwe kan lati inu apo rẹ.
That’s sure to come soon.	Iyẹn daju lati wa laipẹ.
The switch is created.	Awọn yipada ti wa ni da.
Raise my hand.	Gbe ọwọ mi soke.
One would of course expect so.	Ọkan yoo dajudaju nireti bẹ.
You know how to do it now.	O mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe ni bayi.
That's the least of it.	Iyẹn kere julọ ninu rẹ.
Don't try to teach me, boy.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati kọ mi, ọmọkunrin.
Thus, we do not know much about certainty about height.	Bayi, a ko mọ pupọ ni idaniloju nipa giga.
Can you bring this food to the table?	Ṣe o le mu ounjẹ yii wa si tabili?
You make games.	O ṣe awọn ere.
Come early and get your seafood !.	Wa ni kutukutu ki o gba ounjẹ okun rẹ!.
We didn’t have much opportunity to get out, and we knew it.	A ko ni anfani pupọ lati jade, ati pe a mọ ọ.
I'm not tired of taking pictures.	Emi ko rẹ mi lati ya awọn aworan.
All information is important.	Gbogbo alaye jẹ pataki.
I, well.	Emi, daradara.
And they are able to do this again and again.	Ati pe wọn ni anfani lati ṣe eyi lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
It is up to us to find them.	O wa fun wa lati wa wọn.
I'm glad you heard that before the meeting with the woman.	Inu mi dun pe o ti gbọ ọrọ yẹn ṣaaju ipade pẹlu obinrin naa.
A house is a house.	Ile kan jẹ ile.
He looked at the two men.	O wo awọn ọkunrin meji naa.
I need to get out of the house.	Mo nilo lati jade kuro ni ile.
You have seen it now, there is nothing you can do about it.	O ti ri i ni bayi, ko si ohun ti o le ṣe nipa rẹ.
This is our promise to you.	Eyi ni ileri wa fun ọ.
I can't know where it will end.	Emi ko le mọ daju ibi ti yoo pari.
We do not know when this happened.	A ko mọ igba ti eyi ti ṣe.
You can't miss me.	O ko le padanu mi.
We want to hear.	A fẹ gbọ.
Just let the football move.	O kan jẹ ki bọọlu gbe.
It is a new law.	Ofin tuntun ni.
There is something about it, something.	Nkankan wa nipa rẹ, nkankan.
They go out to catch them all and get nothing.	Wọn jade lati mu gbogbo wọn ko si gba ohunkohun.
Teachers use.	Awọn olukọ lo.
There are two cars.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ meji ti wa.
I will not agree to one.	Emi ko ni gba si ọkan.
He wants you to stay.	O fe ki o duro.
I did not leave them.	Emi ko fi wọn silẹ.
This is you.	Eyi ni iwọ.
I have a very good plan.	Mo ni eto to dara pupọ.
I've found something on this error.	Mo ti sọ ri nkankan lori yi aṣiṣe.
I don't know what's going on.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
There is a lot of food available in restaurants.	Pupọ wa jẹ ọpọlọpọ ounjẹ wa ni awọn ile ounjẹ.
There is no reason to write anyone out.	Ko si idi lati kọ ẹnikẹni jade.
He bought a used car.	O ra ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti a lo.
We do this for you as for ourselves.	A ṣe eyi fun ọ bi fun ara wa.
I think we need hands.	Mo ro pe a nilo ọwọ.
I think it was probably not very active.	Mo ro pe o je jasi ko gidigidi lọwọ.
Last night was beyond anything you could expect.	Ni alẹ ana ti kọja ohunkohun ti o le nireti.
One in the morning, one in the afternoon.	Ọkan ni owurọ, ọkan ni ọsan.
Very good, he said.	O dara pupọ, o sọ.
As in the report.	Bi ninu iroyin.
People don’t notice it.	Awọn eniyan ko ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
You know, they have a word.	O mọ, wọn ni ọrọ kan.
You can not say when it is.	O ko le sọ akoko ti o jẹ.
Don't feel anything.	Maṣe lero ohunkohun.
You need to move, always move.	O nilo lati gbe, nigbagbogbo gbe.
He will do well.	Oun yoo ṣe daradara.
It is used to do a lot.	O ti lo lati ṣe pupọ.
He lives near this place.	O ngbe nitosi ibi yii.
But there are problems.	Ṣugbọn awọn iṣoro wa.
I really enjoyed this.	Mo gbadun eyi gaan.
There are many ways in which you can put your life story together.	Awọn ọna pupọ lo wa ti o le fi itan igbesi aye rẹ papọ.
You can leave me.	O le fi mi silẹ.
Just take my word for it and leave.	O kan gba ọrọ mi fun rẹ o si lọ kuro.
It is friendly and very easy to work with.	O jẹ ọrẹ ati rọrun pupọ lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
I lost my passion for this game.	Mo ti padanu ife gidigidi fun ere yi.
But it was not yet time to tell her.	Ṣugbọn ko tii pe lati sọ fun u.
That didn’t take long.	Iyẹn ko gba pipẹ.
Again, this is a good point.	Lẹẹkansi, eyi jẹ aaye ti o dara.
We cannot work without electricity.	A ko le ṣiṣẹ laisi ina.
But there are better things to do.	Ṣugbọn awọn ohun ti o dara julọ wa lati ṣe.
We have no problem deciding that you can.	A ko ni iṣoro lati pinnu pe o le.
Songs like this scare me.	Awọn orin bii eyi n bẹru mi.

People will laugh when they see us.	Eniyan yoo rẹrin nigbati wọn ba ri wa.
And go on.	Ati ki o lọ lori.
Find me a box.	Wa mi apoti kan.
You will die here.	Iwọ yoo ku nibi.

We have to get us to their house.	A ni lati gba wa si ile wọn.
It is completely true that he was taken as a child.	O jẹ otitọ patapata pe o ya bi ọmọde.
He will always give you space to talk to Him.	Oun yoo fun ọ ni aye nigbagbogbo lati ba a sọrọ.
Maybe we should talk together.	Boya o yẹ ki a sọrọ papọ.
I get it to say it many times.	Mo gba rẹ lati sọ ọ ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
The hour is long and you need rest.	Wakati naa ti pẹ ati pe o nilo isinmi.
It grows in tropical areas.	O dagba ni awọn agbegbe ti o gbona.
Now, we have talked enough.	Bayi, a ti sọrọ to.
Families can grow.	Awọn idile le dagba.
A table service.	Iṣẹ tabili kan.
This in itself may seem like an easy task.	Eyi funrararẹ le dabi iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
Others laughed, too.	Awọn miiran rẹrin, paapaa.
We killed many of them.	A pa ọpọlọpọ wọn.
He did well with both.	O ṣe daradara pẹlu awọn mejeeji.
Your baby's body.	Ara ọmọ rẹ.
Ask him to leave you.	Sọ pe ki o fi ọ silẹ.
Ask me or my methods again.	Beere mi tabi awọn ọna mi lẹẹkansi.
Switch to it.	Yipada si i.
That should have been expected.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o ti nireti.
They are not used.	A ko lo wọn.
I must hate this device.	Mo gbọdọ korira yi ẹrọ.
Okay, this is your favorite day.	O dara, eyi ti jẹ ọjọ ti o nifẹ si.
They will always start another idea.	Wọn yoo bẹrẹ imọran miiran nigbagbogbo.
But poor nutrition is a major problem.	Ṣugbọn ounjẹ ti ko dara jẹ iṣoro pataki.
That is informative, but important.	Iyẹn jẹ alaye, ṣugbọn pataki.
Could this go to the one who ate it the wrong way.	Njẹ eyi le lọ ọkan ti o jẹun ni ọna ti ko tọ.
He was good at it, too.	O si wà dara ni o, ju.
They can’t hurt your little boy so much.	Wọn ko le ba ọmọkunrin kekere rẹ jẹ bẹ.
They affect men.	Wọn kan awọn ọkunrin.
Two would be fine, but one would do.	Meji yoo dara julọ, ṣugbọn ọkan yoo ṣe.
No one went to see.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o lọ wo.
I wore it out.	Mo wọ ọ jade.
I do not know how to wait.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe le duro.
Everyone should stop if they have life.	Gbogbo eniyan yẹ ki o da duro ti wọn ba ni aye.
He did not eat.	O ko jẹun.
Maybe they did too.	Boya wọn tun ṣe.
Don’t be afraid to make mistakes.	Maṣe bẹru lati ṣe awọn aṣiṣe.
See it now.	Wo rẹ bayi.
In the city, most of the time.	Ni ilu, julọ ti awọn akoko.
It's going.	O n lọ.
These people have jobs.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi ni awọn iṣẹ.
His head lifted.	Ori re gbe.
If you do not know who these people are, fine.	Ti o ko ba mọ tani awọn eniyan wọnyi jẹ, o dara.
I want to find out what.	Mo fẹ lati wa kini.
My sister has some and loves them.	Arabinrin mi ni diẹ ninu awọn ti o si nifẹ wọn.
And that's what I need.	Ati pe ohun ti Mo nilo.
About material reasons.	Nipa awọn idi ohun elo.
In our program, your skills can talk to you.	Ninu eto wa, awọn ọgbọn rẹ le ba ọ sọrọ.
I want to make you remember that and everything else.	Mo fẹ lati jẹ ki o ranti iyẹn ati ohun gbogbo miiran.
Use the right amount of water.	Lo iye omi ti o tọ.
They have to stay there.	Wọn ni lati duro nibẹ.
It has been incredibly amazing.	O ti jẹ iyalẹnu gaan.
I will accept your love.	Emi yoo gba ifẹ rẹ.
He sat with his hands in his pockets.	O joko pẹlu ọwọ rẹ ninu apo rẹ.
Bring it back to me.	Mu u pada si mi.
The more you know, the more opportunities seem to appear.	Awọn diẹ ti o mọ, awọn diẹ anfani dabi lati han.
Say what you want about it.	Sọ ohun ti o fẹ nipa rẹ.
Very interesting news.	Awọn iroyin ti o nifẹ pupọ.
A mu pupo.	A mu pupo.
With that I ended up.	Pẹlu iyẹn Mo pari.
When you do homework, you do well.	Nigbati o ba ṣe iṣẹ ile, o ṣe daradara.
I am very happy with this game.	Inu mi dun gaan pẹlu ere yii.
They love it here.	Wọn nifẹ rẹ nibi.
We believe this is important for three reasons.	A gbagbọ pe eyi jẹ pataki fun awọn idi mẹta.
He had a large family.	O ni idile nla kan.
Much less than he would have expected.	Elo kere ju oun yoo ti nireti lọ.
My dad started talking about music.	Baba mi bẹrẹ sọrọ nipa orin.
It can change.	O le yipada.
You will be outside in all weather conditions.	Iwọ yoo wa ni ita ni gbogbo awọn ipo oju ojo.
It is not enough for you to be informed in one.	Ko to fun o lati jẹ alaye ninu ọkan.
Go around the table.	Lọ ni ayika tabili.
For a long time it was now.	Fun awọn akoko pipẹ o wa bayi.
Of course he told me about it.	Dajudaju o sọ fun mi nipa rẹ.
I am already eating.	Mo ti wa ni ounjẹ tẹlẹ.
Time to call for help.	Akoko lati pe fun iranlọwọ.
You can find it in the table below.	O le rii ni tabili ni isalẹ.
Call the police.	Pe ọlọpa.
You can write something.	O le kọ nkan kan.
Therefore, you have removed them.	Nitorina, o ti yọ wọn kuro.
They are not interested because there is more for them to do.	Wọn ko nifẹ nitori pe diẹ wa fun wọn lati ṣe.
He does not like it very much.	Ko fẹran o ṣe pataki.
Growing into it.	Ti dagba sinu rẹ.
They stand hard.	Wọn duro lile.
I was home smaller and smaller.	Mo ti wà ile kere ati ki o kere.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe fun u.
They begin to walk to sea.	Wọn bẹrẹ si rin si okun.
But there is one more interesting thing.	Ṣugbọn nibẹ ni ọkan diẹ awon ohun.
We will get to that.	A yoo gba si iyẹn.
Maybe there really was something here.	Boya nibẹ gan wà nkankan nibi.
They both stopped for a minute like that.	Awọn mejeeji duro ni iṣẹju kan bi iyẹn.
Nothing about that should be surprising.	Ko si nkankan nipa iyẹn yẹ ki o jẹ iyalẹnu.
But your home is not your home at all.	Ṣugbọn ile rẹ kii ṣe ile rẹ rara.
We want to be, but no one is interested in us.	A fẹ lati jẹ, ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o nifẹ si wa.
He told you about me.	O sọ fun ọ nipa mi.
No other button works.	Ko si bọtini miiran ṣiṣẹ.
They are my friends.	Ọrẹ mi ni wọn.
Have you decided to try again?	Ṣe o ti pinnu lati gbiyanju lẹẹkansi?
If you have more money.	Ti o ba jẹ pe o ni owo diẹ sii.
It makes the river.	O je ki odo.
I know that such things cannot happen.	Mo mọ pe iru awọn nkan bẹẹ ko le ṣẹlẹ.
Break down.	Ko ṣiṣẹ.
Maybe one day it will happen.	Boya ojo kan o yoo ṣẹlẹ.
We will bring it back to the store tomorrow.	A yoo mu pada si ile itaja ni ọla.
For the first time ever.	Igba akọkọ lailai.
You are gone now.	O ti lọ bayi.
I told them everything.	Mo sọ ohun gbogbo fun wọn.
She laughs a lot when she is happy.	O rẹrin julọ nigbati o ba dun.
This is something that will be more helpful in the long run.	Eyi jẹ nkan ti yoo jẹ iranlọwọ diẹ sii ni igba pipẹ.
At this meeting, think again.	Ni ipade yii, tun ro lẹẹkansi.
It is one of the reasons you like it so much.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn idi ti o fẹ pupọ.
Are you sure you would like to do that?	Ṣe o da ọ loju pe iwọ yoo fẹ lati ṣe iyẹn?
We have the ability to be better.	A ni agbara lati dara julọ.
The camp was over for the day, and it was time to go home.	Ibudo pari fun ọjọ naa, o si to akoko lati lọ si ile.
To maintain your home.	Lati tọju ile rẹ.
Very much, my wife would say.	Pupọ pupọ, iyawo mi yoo sọ.
He turned to walk away, and sold something.	O yipada lati rin kuro, o si ta nkan kan.
You can do a lot with it.	O le ṣe pupọ pẹlu rẹ.
You have been reading a lot lately.	O ti n ka pupọ laipẹ.
And you can see through it.	Ati pe o le rii nipasẹ rẹ.
There is no question about that.	Ko si ibeere nipa iyẹn.
This does not work either.	Eyi ko ṣiṣẹ boya.
So when she saw him there, she marveled.	Nitorina nigbati o ri i nibẹ, o ya ara rẹ.
She didn't even tell him she was calling.	Paapaa ko sọ fun u pe o ti pe.
Because if you go back here, nothing is waiting for you.	Nitori ti o ba pada si ibi, ko si nkankan ti o duro de ọ.
Maybe we can help each other.	Boya a le ran ara wa lọwọ.
It just can't be done.	O kan ko le ṣee ṣe.
Very nice and nice.	Rọrun dara julọ.
We do not know how long or how long it will last.	A ko mọ bi o ṣe pẹ to tabi bi yoo ti pẹ to.
More men arrived.	Awọn ọkunrin diẹ sii de.
We opened the door.	A ṣi ilẹkun.
You think you hate that.	O ro pe o korira iyẹn.
Temporary.	Fun igba diẹ.
When they find their mistake they will try again.	Nigbati wọn ba rii aṣiṣe wọn wọn yoo tun gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
It will not change me.	Ko ni yi mi pada.
Do not leave your food unattended.	Maṣe fi ounjẹ rẹ silẹ.
But, you can't give if someone won't accept.	Ṣugbọn, o ko ba le fun o ba ti ẹnikan yoo ko gba.
You can talk about it if you want.	O le sọrọ nipa rẹ ti o ba fẹ.
I can't do it.	Nko le se e.
He let me touch.	O jẹ ki n fi ọwọ kan.
Again, we come with bad news.	Lẹẹkansi, a wa pẹlu awọn iroyin buburu.
His football is moving.	Bọọlu rẹ n gbe.
This is why their system will not work.	Eyi ni idi ti eto wọn kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
I will continue with my life.	Emi yoo tẹsiwaju pẹlu igbesi aye mi.
Everyone knows there is something to learn yet.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ pe nkan wa lati kọ ẹkọ sibẹsibẹ.
Of course, he did not see anyone.	Dajudaju, ko ri ẹnikan.
He loves the child before the child knows of his life.	O nifẹ ọmọ naa ṣaaju ki ọmọ naa to mọ ti aye rẹ.
I did not know.	Mi o mọ.
No one kept that, either.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o tọju iyẹn, boya.
We are allowed to do that.	A gba wa laaye si iyẹn.
Maybe something will work for you, especially.	Boya ohun ti yoo ṣiṣẹ fun ọ, paapaa.
Let’s assume there is one.	Jẹ ki a ro pe ọkan wa.
Do not write anything to your questionnaires.	Maṣe kọ ohunkohun si awọn iwe ibeere rẹ.
It has no past, no future.	O ni ko si ti o ti kọja, ko si ojo iwaju.
Boys and girls.	Awọn ọmọkunrin ati awọn ọmọbirin.
The dogs did not stop.	Awọn aja ko duro.
I live from hand to mouth.	Mo n gbe lati ọwọ de ẹnu.
That is, in a way, very good news.	Iyẹn ni, ni ọna kan, awọn iroyin ti o dara pupọ.
I will leave my books.	Emi yoo fi awọn iwe mi silẹ.
Please let me know what you think.	Jọwọ jẹ ki mi mọ ohun ti o ro.
It rained all day.	Ojo ro fun gbogbo ojo.
Your victory stays out in the cold and we still run the body.	Rẹ gun duro jade ninu otutu ti a si tun ṣiṣe awọn ara.
No question is too detailed.	Ko si ibeere jẹ alaye ju.
If you want to hurt him anymore, just do it.	Ti o ba fẹ lati ṣe ipalara fun u mọ, o kan ṣe.
I have two.	Mo ni meji.
I really don't want to go out for dinner.	Emi ko fẹ gaan lati jade fun ounjẹ alẹ.
Even that took two days.	Paapaa iyẹn gba ọjọ meji.
All helped by.	Gbogbo ran nipa.
They played a great game.	Wọn ṣe ere nla kan.
But they are there.	Ṣugbọn wọn wa nibẹ.
And I have teachers now to show me something.	Ati pe Mo ni awọn olukọ bayi lati fi nkan han mi.
But the facts are the facts.	Ṣugbọn awọn otitọ jẹ awọn otitọ.
It hit everyone but one person.	O lu gbogbo eniyan ṣugbọn eniyan kan.
It looks like age.	O dabi ọjọ ori.
He is looking at me.	O n wo mi.
Any woman can give him that.	Eyikeyi obinrin le fun u pe.
Not much you want here.	Ko Elo ti o fe nibi.
His hand is purple.	Ọwọ rẹ jẹ eleyi ti.
The sister knew very well what that could mean.	Arabinrin naa mọ daradara kini iyẹn le tumọ si.
However the work is very good.	Sibẹsibẹ iṣẹ naa dara pupọ.
Not many groups have that.	Ko ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹgbẹ ni iyẹn.
I love this kind of thing.	Mo nifẹ iru nkan bayi.
I have learned a lot from her.	Mo ti kọ ẹkọ pupọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
Great thing to me.	Ohun nla si mi.
She sat behind her desk.	O joko lẹhin tabili rẹ.
It has been for him a time or two.	O ti jẹ fun u ni akoko kan tabi meji.
Come up here we will talk.	Wa soke nibi a yoo sọrọ.
Children go to school.	Awọn ọmọde lọ si ile-iwe.
Whatever you wanted to expect, that was clear.	Ohunkohun ti o fe reti, ti o je ko o.
I'm glad he'll be there with me.	Inu mi dun pe oun yoo wa nibẹ pẹlu mi.
She loves tall, handsome men.	O nifẹ awọn ọkunrin ti o ga, ti o dara.
I know it can't be easy to know.	Mo mọ pe ko le rọrun lati mọ.
It works for the benefit of the world.	O ṣiṣẹ fun awọn anfani ti aye.
Make sure this phone is near you now.	Rii daju pe foonu yi wa nitosi rẹ ni bayi.
But not how.	Sugbon ko bi o.
Take a few minutes here.	Gba awọn iṣẹju diẹ nibi.
He has a family.	O ni idile kan.
He does not know.	Ko mọ.
Do not get into any trouble.	Maṣe wọ inu wahala eyikeyi.
Let word be word and word be so, word.	Jẹ ki ọrọ jẹ ọrọ ati ọrọ jẹ bẹ, ọrọ.
None of us expects you to do anything other than that.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa ti o nireti pe o ṣe ohunkohun miiran ju iyẹn lọ.
Accept completely.	Gba patapata.
I would like to know more about this.	Emi yoo fẹ lati mọ diẹ sii nipa eyi.
I think it would be a very good thing.	Mo ro pe yoo jẹ ohun ti o dara pupọ.
I asked a question.	Mo beere ibeere kan.
What do you want to see happen.	Kini o fẹ lati rii ṣẹlẹ.
The sun is out.	Oorun ti jade.
But you first.	Ṣugbọn iwọ akọkọ.
Time seems to pass.	Akoko dabi pe o kọja.
He left the cause.	O fi silẹ ni idi.
People have parked for their cars there.	Awọn eniyan ti pa fun awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wọn nibẹ.
I found it in me.	Mo ti rii ninu mi.
There are three more on the way.	Mẹta miiran wa ni ọna.
I want to do that too.	Mo tun fẹ ṣe iyẹn.
I was born on my birthday.	Ojo ibi mi ni won bi mi.
In their cars.	Ninu awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wọn.
Try to be confident.	Gbiyanju lati ni idaniloju.
It seems important to like it.	O dabi pataki lati fẹ rẹ.
I need to know everything.	Mo nilo lati mọ ohun gbogbo.
Build a plan.	Kọ eto.
We will never know.	A kii yoo mọ.
Many boys at his age who live together.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọkunrin ni ọjọ ori tirẹ ti wọn gbe papọ.
If you die more, that’s fine.	Ti o ba ku diẹ sii, iyẹn dara.
In the end, you can still run.	Ni ipari, o le tun sare.
Clean face.	Oju ti o mọ.
They’ve said things.	Wọn ti sọ awọn nkan.
But for now, it will be you.	Ṣugbọn fun bayi, yoo jẹ iwọ.
I am not good.	Emi ko dara.
They will not take advice.	Wọn kii yoo gba imọran.
They are very happy now.	Inu won dun pupo ni bayi.
It could change in the next few hours.	O le yipada ni awọn wakati diẹ to nbọ.
We did not hurry to get home.	A ko yara lati de ile.
I mean, think of it.	Mo tumọ si, ronu rẹ.
I want it out.	Mo fe e jade.
I love it, you know.	Mo nifẹ rẹ, o mọ.
That may be true.	Iyẹn ṣee ṣe otitọ.
You need good quality shoes.	O nilo bata bata to dara.
If it was a good night, we could walk.	Ti o ba jẹ alẹ ti o dara, a le rin.
But soon he realized that he would not benefit.	Ṣugbọn laipẹ o rii pe oun kii yoo ni anfani.
Everything will even come out in the end.	Ohun gbogbo yoo paapaa jade ni ipari.
Often they don’t seem to get it.	Nigbagbogbo wọn ko dabi lati gba.
And sometimes they continue.	Ati nigba miiran wọn tẹsiwaju.
This is my last.	Eleyi jẹ mi kẹhin.
He refuses to acknowledge that he has a problem.	O kọ lati gba pe o ni iṣoro kan.
I did this myself.	Mo ṣe eyi funrararẹ.
She lost her enduring love.	O padanu ifẹ rẹ ti o duro.
She's very angry, she's happy.	O binu pupọ, o dun.
Not much, of course.	Ko Elo, dajudaju.
I should have loved to hear all about it.	Mo ti yẹ ki o nifẹ lati gbọ gbogbo nipa rẹ.
I have tried myself.	Mo ti gbiyanju ara mi.
You can come for me.	O le wa fun mi.
Just wear one.	Kan wọ ọkan.
Very good indeed.	O dara pupọ ni otitọ.
People want to help you.	Eniyan fẹ lati ran o.
He experimented with many ways of handling the problem.	O ṣe idanwo pẹlu ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna ti mimu iṣoro naa.
Think in terms of money at hand.	Ronu ni awọn ofin ti owo ni ọwọ.

I just read this now.	Mo kan ka eyi ni bayi.
I like meeting ideas.	Mo feran ero ipade.
His mother kissed him on the forehead.	Iya re fi ẹnu ko o ni iwaju.
They fear what can be brought out in the test.	Wọn bẹru ohun ti a le mu jade ni idanwo.
I will lose my job.	Emi yoo padanu iṣẹ mi.
Use as you wish.	Lo bi o ṣe fẹ.

But this is the first.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ akọkọ.
A few minutes.	Awọn iṣẹju diẹ.
Do not repeat the scene.	Maṣe tun oju naa ṣe.
When you do a good job, he will tell you.	Nigbati o ba ṣe iṣẹ to dara, yoo sọ fun ọ.
I am the only one who can do this.	Emi nikan ni o le ṣe eyi.

For me he will be a husband.	Fun mi oun yoo jẹ ọkọ.
By this, the program finds its own importance.	Nipa eyi, eto naa rii pataki ti ara rẹ.
Rub on your skin.	Bi won lori rẹ ara.
Just one way, way better than anything else.	O kan ọna, ọna dara ju ohunkohun miiran.

We make our own rules.	A ṣe awọn ofin ti ara wa.
It also works the other way around.	O tun ṣiṣẹ ni ọna miiran.
You don’t mean that.	Iwọ ko tumọ si iyẹn.
Three of them are still alive.	Mẹta ninu wọn tun wa laaye.
He did not think.	Ko ro.

He is my best friend.	Oun ni ọrẹ mi to dara julọ.

Put them all together and you have a car.	Fi gbogbo wọn papọ ati pe o ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
Try to get some rest.	Gbiyanju ki o gba isinmi diẹ.
And that should be it.	Ati pe iyẹn ni o yẹ ki o jẹ.
However, they did themselves well.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn ṣe ara wọn daradara.
We need to treat it that way.	A nilo lati tọju rẹ ni ọna yẹn.

We don’t want to give them a chance to run.	A ko fẹ lati fun wọn ni aye lati ṣiṣe.
He was not the only one who thought something.	Kii ṣe oun nikan ni o ro nkankan.
Boy, did we miss it.	Ọmọkunrin, ṣe a padanu rẹ.
Why are you here?	Kini idi ti o wa nibi?
I think that’s pretty much it.	Mo ro pe iyẹn lẹwa pupọ.
I will leave this house.	Emi yoo kuro ni ile yii.
Small, but impossible.	Kekere, ṣugbọn ko ṣeeṣe.
But essentially the same problem.	Ṣugbọn ni pataki ni iṣoro kanna.
It just stays cool.	O kan duro dara.
Maybe that changed.	Boya iyẹn yipada.
By the time you arrive, you will already be late!	Ni akoko ti o ba de, iwọ yoo ti pẹ tẹlẹ!
Together, they look at each other.	Papọ, wọn wo ara wọn.
None of that here.	Ko si ọkan ninu iyẹn nibi.
I want to tell him, for me.	Mo fe lati so fun u pe, fun mi.
Or but.	Tabi sugbon.
Make sure you look at the time carefully.	Rii daju pe o wo akoko naa daradara.
I can't stay here anymore.	Nko le duro nibi mo.
More things are coming.	Diẹ sii ti awọn nkan n bọ.
It’s not just my thing.	Kii ṣe nkan mi nikan.
Again, just because it is not my type of book.	Lẹẹkansi, nikan nitori pe kii ṣe iru iwe mi.
My father knew the way.	Baba mi mọ ọna naa.
This week you must come back to me.	Ni ọsẹ alẹ yii o gbọdọ pada wa si ọdọ mi.
However, we will never eat again.	Sibẹsibẹ, a kii yoo tun ṣe ounjẹ lẹẹkansi.
He made himself think.	O mu ara rẹ ro pe.
Accompany me on my little trip.	Ba mi rin ni irin-ajo kekere mi.
She remembers seeing her mother.	O ranti ri iya rẹ.
Good times there.	Awọn akoko ti o dara nibẹ.
They became important only under the new law.	Wọn di pataki nikan labẹ ofin tuntun.
I did not play the game.	Emi ko ṣe ere naa.
I want to show myself.	Mo fe fi ara mi han.
For days we worried about what might grow out of it.	Fun awọn ọjọ a ṣe aniyan nipa kini o le dagba lati inu rẹ.
We really do.	A ṣe gaan.
No one wants to work in the garden.	Ko si ẹniti o fẹ ṣiṣẹ ninu ọgba.
But we had to move my car.	Sugbon a ni lati gbe ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi.
All your wonderful promises are yours.	Gbogbo awọn ileri iyanu rẹ jẹ tirẹ.
We will see him.	A yoo ri i.
And what a hot thing to come back with.	Ati kini nkan ti o gbona lati pada pẹlu.
He could not see the big picture.	Ko le ri aworan nla naa.
He told me the man's name.	O sọ orukọ eniyan naa fun mi.
I hope they will understand my reasons.	Mo nireti pe wọn yoo loye awọn idi mi.
She is young and beautiful.	O jẹ ọdọ ati lẹwa.
For the remaining amount because he refused to pay for it.	Fun iye ti o ku nitori pe o kọ lati san fun u.
We can not help you.	A ko le ran o.
You need to go get some of that work.	O nilo lati lọ gba diẹ ninu iṣẹ yẹn.
You don’t want the man to come back with help.	O ko fẹ ki ọkunrin naa pada pẹlu iranlọwọ.
They knew it was going to be a big wedding.	Wọn mọ pe yoo jẹ igbeyawo nla kan.
A year ago, it would not have been so.	Ni ọdun kan sẹhin, kii yoo ti ri bẹ.
They have no idea what is good and what is not.	Wọn ko ni imọran ohun ti o dara ati ohun ti kii ṣe.
I can’t do much with it.	Emi ko le ṣe pupọ pẹlu rẹ.
You have done a good job here.	O ti ṣe iṣẹ to dara nibi.
I opened the door and looked inside.	Mo ti ilẹkun si silẹ, mo si wo inu.
Both wanted something they were told they could not have.	Awọn mejeeji fẹ nkan ti wọn sọ fun wọn pe wọn ko le ni.
There is still much to be done.	Pupọ ṣi wa lati wa.
I tried them again.	Mo tun gbiyanju wọn lẹẹkansi.
The sister also woke up.	Arabinrin naa tun ji.
But he said he would meet me.	Ṣugbọn o sọ pe oun yoo pade mi ni.
I've lost it, he thought.	Mo ti sọ padanu rẹ, o ro.
Repeat with the remaining keys.	Tun ṣe pẹlu awọn bọtini ti o ku.
But that is one.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ ọkan.
So keep this up.	Nitorina tọju eyi.
If you do, it works.	Ti o ba ṣe, o ṣiṣẹ.
The child can not.	Ọmọ ko le.
Obviously our position.	O han ni ipo wa.
I just have to jump in.	Mo kan ni lati fo sinu.
You just can't make this kind of thing up.	O kan ko le ṣe iru nkan yii soke.
There ought to be fireworks.	Nibẹ yẹ lati wa ni ise ina.
You always repeat yourself.	O nigbagbogbo tun ara rẹ.
It cannot be mistaken in any way.	Ko le ṣe aṣiṣe ni eyikeyi ọna.
They do not need it.	Wọn ko nilo rẹ.
Lots of people.	Pupọ eniyan pupọ.
I have found something.	Mo ti ri nkan.
Give it to your law school.	Fi fun ile-iwe ofin rẹ.
I am on a mission.	Mo wa lori ise kan.
It is not a power trip.	Kii ṣe irin-ajo agbara.
It's really beautiful.	O lẹwa gaan.
No one can take them away.	Ko si ẹniti o le mu wọn lọ.
No way.	Ko ṣee ṣe.
This street comes with shops.	Opopona yii wa pẹlu awọn ile itaja.
The site will let you down this year.	Aaye naa yoo jẹ ki o lọ silẹ ni ọdun yii.
But that, of course, is another story, and another book.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn sibẹsibẹ, jẹ itan miiran, ati iwe miiran.
It does not say anything about how it happened.	O ko sọ nkankan nipa bi o ṣe ṣẹlẹ.
He walked to the port.	O rin si ibudo.
There are three children in school right now.	Awọn ọmọde mẹta wa ni ile-iwe ni bayi.
If hit.	Ti o ba ti lu.
That’s not the way it should be, but that’s how it is.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ọna ti o yẹ ki o jẹ, ṣugbọn iyẹn ni bi o ṣe jẹ.
One has expected.	Ọkan ti reti.
I did not see him until he was over me.	Emi ko ri i titi o fi wa lori mi.
he wanted to ask.	o fe beere.
Maybe my conditions were good enough then.	Boya awọn ipo mi dara to ni idi nigba naa.
Music is very important to me too.	Orin ṣe pataki pupọ fun mi pẹlu.
They need to get their money back.	Wọn nilo lati mu awọn owo wọn pada.
And internal values ​​are working hours.	Ati awọn iye inu jẹ awọn wakati iṣẹ.
I know that and you know that.	Mo mọ iyẹn ati pe o mọ iyẹn.
Can't think you've exhausted them forever.	Ko le ro pe o ti rẹ wọn lailai.
The streets you want to rise on.	Awọn ita ti o fẹ dide lori.
The first two weeks were hard.	Awọn ọsẹ meji akọkọ jẹ lile.
It’s not the books you get from your store, he said.	Kii ṣe awọn iwe ti o gba lati ile itaja rẹ, o sọ.
We fear we may miss it.	A bẹru pe a le padanu rẹ.
It should be the other way around.	O yẹ ki o jẹ ọna miiran ni ayika.
I can hope it starts.	Mo le lero pe o bẹrẹ.
They are beautiful room.	Wọn yara lẹwa.
This is a great value.	Eyi jẹ iye nla.
We don't want to get out of here.	A ko fẹ lati jade ni ibi yii.
The school, however, is relatively new.	Ile-iwe naa, sibẹsibẹ, jẹ tuntun.
We were given our money.	A fun wa ni owo wa.
That tree is very tall.	Igi yẹn ga pupọ.
The cat fell asleep.	Ologbo naa sun sun.
They want you to know how much they love you.	Wọn fẹ ki o mọ iye ti wọn nifẹ rẹ.
I want to keep thinking about it.	Mo fẹ lati ma ronu nipa rẹ.
What it is or where it is, cannot say.	Ohun ti o jẹ tabi ibiti o wa, ko le sọ.
Let this happen.	Jẹ ki eyi ṣẹlẹ.
So why not try something like this.	Nitorina kilode ti o ko gbiyanju nkan bi eyi.
No one.	Ko si eniyan kankan.
And he loved it.	Ati ki o feran re.
It has to do with what it is.	O jẹ lati ṣe pẹlu ohun ti o jẹ.
I have boys on the road.	Mo ni awọn ọmọkunrin lori ọna.
He had legs around him.	O ti ẹsẹ ni ayika rẹ.
But that is not the case at all.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ri bẹẹ rara.
Their two-day wedding was something else.	Igbeyawo ọjọ meji wọn jẹ nkan miiran.
People want to look like these.	Eniyan fẹ lati wo bi wọnyi.
It’s already done, and it makes it work.	O ti ṣe tẹlẹ, o si jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
Continue to do the right things.	Tẹsiwaju lati ṣe awọn ohun ti o tọ.
Two to one.	Meji si ọkan.
Spend the day with us !.	Lo ọjọ naa pẹlu wa!.
If you want to go, get out now.	Ti o ba fẹ lọ, jade ni bayi.
You do not have to ask.	O ko ni lati beere fun.
The dress was a gift from her mother.	Aṣọ naa jẹ ẹbun lati ọdọ iya rẹ.
The sister would not have come to this meeting if not.	Arabinrin ko ba ti wa si ipade yii bi kii ba ṣe bẹẹ.
I just lost my baby.	Mo kan padanu ọmọ mi.
There are no decisions to be made at this meeting.	Ko si awọn ipinnu lati ṣe ni ipade yii.
Children will learn more.	Awọn ọmọde yoo kọ ẹkọ diẹ.
But it should go.	Ṣugbọn o yẹ ki o lọ.
Lots of things like that.	Ọpọlọpọ nkan bii iyẹn.
Why does this take so long?	Kini idi ti eyi n gba to gun?
The people around him at that time.	Awọn eniyan ti o wa ni ayika ni akoko yẹn.
I know we do.	Mo mọ pe a ṣe.
Everyone got their hands out.	Gbogbo eniyan ni ọwọ wọn jade.
No words here.	Ko si awọn ọrọ nibi.
He is not the one we are talking about.	Kii ṣe oun ni a n sọrọ nipa rẹ.
It’s beautiful without it.	O lẹwa laisi rẹ.
He’s not the most important thing here.	Oun kii ṣe ohun ti o ṣe pataki nibi.
It brought me back together.	O mu mi pada papọ.
That's your business.	Iṣẹ rẹ niyẹn.
If you can work around them, do so.	Ti o ba le ṣiṣẹ ni ayika wọn, ṣe bẹ.
I hope he can’t get it.	Mo nireti pe ko le gba.
If for some reason everything is fine to continue, proceed.	Ti o ba jẹ fun idi kan ohun gbogbo dara lati tẹsiwaju, tẹsiwaju.
You do not believe my eyes.	O ko gbagbọ oju mi.
Now the classes are about to begin.	Bayi awọn kilasi ti fẹrẹ bẹrẹ.
And with good reason.	Ati pẹlu idi ti o dara.
I was afraid of that.	Mo ti bẹru iyẹn.
You get yourself educated.	O gba ara rẹ ni ẹkọ.
I took it off.	Mo gbe e kuro.
For other people, not for me.	Fun awọn eniyan miiran, kii ṣe fun mi.
Very not even noticeable.	Pupọ ko paapaa ṣe akiyesi.
Great holiday for them to leave.	Isinmi nla fun wọn lati lọ kuro.
I can't tell you how much they have changed my life.	Emi ko le so fun o bi o Elo ti won ti yi pada aye mi.
I met this guy on my way home from work.	Mo pade eniyan yii ni ọna mi si ile lati ibi iṣẹ.
Physically there is no desire to go.	Nipa ti ara ko ni ifẹ lati lọ.
You want it to be.	O fẹ pe o jẹ.
Some of you know it's over.	Diẹ ninu awọn ara rẹ mọ pe o ti pari.
I just had a great time.	Mo kan ni akoko nla kan.
I have seen your true face.	Mo ti rii oju otitọ rẹ.
You need to hear what is being said.	O nilo lati gbọ ohun ti a sọ.
You know it.	O mọ ọ.
Maybe not him.	Boya kii ṣe oun.
That way.	Ni ọna yẹn.
He did not receive the song.	Ko gba orin naa.
In some cases, girls drop out of school altogether.	Ni awọn igba miiran, awọn ọmọbirin lọ kuro ni ile-iwe patapata.
Or, do something physical during your time out.	Tabi, ṣe ohun ti ara nigba akoko rẹ jade.
Some special people will be there.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan pataki yoo wa nibẹ.
From the phone company.	Lati ile-iṣẹ foonu.
You have those in the field.	O ni awọn ti o wa ni aaye.
People always ask him for a way.	Awọn eniyan nigbagbogbo beere lọwọ rẹ fun ọna.
The main roads in this area are full.	Awọn opopona akọkọ ni agbegbe yii ti kun.
Everyone is surprised.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o ya.
I have another question to ask you.	Mo ni ibeere miiran lati beere lọwọ rẹ.
It is night.	O wa ni alẹ.
I mean, good enough.	Mo tumọ si, o dara to.
I beg you not to kill me, boy.	Mo bẹ ọ pe ki o maṣe pa mi, ọmọkunrin kan.
Man of few words.	Ọkunrin ti ọrọ diẹ.
But it was.	Sugbon o je.
I hope it changes of course.	Mo nireti pe o yipada dajudaju.
This is the job that should work for you.	Eyi ni iṣẹ ti o yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ fun ọ.
My sister is very nice with my mother.	Arabinrin mi dara julọ pẹlu iya mi.
His eyes are full.	Oju rẹ kun.
He took my hand and held it to her.	O mu ọwọ mi o si gbe e si ọdọ rẹ.
This is a game, he said to himself.	Eyi jẹ ere kan, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
She had enjoyed her time on her bed.	O ti gbadun akoko rẹ lori ibusun rẹ.
It was the last day of the year.	O jẹ ọjọ ti o kẹhin ti ọdun.
He grabbed me.	O di mi mu.
I'm very happy.	Inu mi dun ju.
We could not find our way home.	A ko le wa ọna wa si ile.
Okay, we have enough money for now.	O dara, a ti ni owo to fun ni bayi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ko si ohun ti o jẹ aṣiṣe pẹlu iyẹn.
He said he would see.	O sọ pe oun yoo rii.
We will not take you back here.	A kii yoo mu ọ pada si ibi.
Get me back and get me.	Gba mi pada ki o gba mi.
He did not know what to worry about.	Oun ko mọ ohun ti o ni aniyan nipa rẹ.
Must continue to grow everywhere.	Gbọdọ tẹsiwaju lati dagba nibi gbogbo.
Only together they appear to have something worth buying.	Nikan papọ ni wọn han lati ni nkan ti o tọ lati ra.
You need to come up with the best advice.	O nilo lati wa pẹlu imọran to dara julọ.
Now the point is gone.	Bayi aaye naa ti lọ.
They are for me, they may not be for you.	Wọn wa fun mi, wọn le ma jẹ fun ọ.
This can happen for several reasons.	Eyi le ṣẹlẹ fun awọn idi pupọ.
He utters words of wisdom.	O sọ awọn ọrọ ọgbọn.
Here is some of the same thing.	Eyi jẹ diẹ ninu ohun kanna.
It's not too late now.	Ko ni pẹ ni bayi.
You want to fear her.	O fẹ bẹru rẹ.
It may be night.	O le jẹ alẹ.
It has been amazing to work with him.	O ti jẹ iyalẹnu lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
Maybe even more.	Boya paapaa diẹ sii.
I want to talk about it.	Mo fẹ sọ nipa rẹ.
She loves to read her letters to me.	O nifẹ lati ka awọn lẹta rẹ fun mi.
Most people understand this.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan loye eyi.
Yours will be even.	Tirẹ yoo jẹ paapaa.
You can get the key from the office.	O le gba bọtini lati ọfiisi.
It painted them beautiful.	O ya wọn lẹwa.
It was his life situation.	O jẹ ipo igbesi aye rẹ.
I asked him what the problem was.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ kini iṣoro naa.
Surprise eyes open.	Awọn oju iyalẹnu ti ṣii.
I’m making games, especially.	Mo n ṣe awọn ere, paapaa.
I hope you change your mind.	Mo nireti pe o yi ọkan rẹ pada.
There is no body.	Nibẹ ti ko si ara.
Let me know if it works for you too.	Jẹ ki n mọ boya o ṣe fun ọ paapaa.
Just enjoy the place and keep it.	O kan gbadun ibiti o wa ki o tọju rẹ.
He can talk to you about anything you drink.	O le ba ọ sọrọ nipa ohunkohun ti o mu.
If it is intended to happen, it will.	Ti o ba ti pinnu lati ṣẹlẹ, yoo.
You put it here, they found it there.	O fi sii nibi, wọn rii nibẹ.
Have to walk around and take pictures.	Ni lati rin ni ayika ati ki o ya awọn aworan.
So it was hard.	Nitorina o jẹ lile.
I can give that away.	Mo le fun iyẹn lọ.
That is the only reason here.	Iyẹn nikan ni idi ti o wa nibi.
But he was angry.	Sugbon o binu.
In a sense of course it is worth it.	Ni ori kan dajudaju o tọ.
They mean nothing.	Wọn ko tumọ si nkankan.
I have had both for many years now.	Mo ti ni awọn mejeeji fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun bayi.
This city is a favorite vacation spot.	Ilu yii jẹ ibi isinmi ayanfẹ.
And that says something really.	Ati pe eyi n sọ nkan kan gaan.
Will definitely make my day.	Yoo dajudaju ṣe ọjọ mi.
He concluded that they did not.	O pari pe wọn ko ṣe.
The ancients spoke of the importance of the river.	Awọn atijọ ti sọ pataki si imọran ti odo.
We have to do so.	A ni lati ṣe bẹ.
That will not.	Ti o ko yoo.
I will take you to your car.	Emi yoo rin ọ si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ.
That was not the case last year.	Ko ni iyẹn ni ọdun to kọja.
Back we will go.	Pada a yoo lọ.
Is there.	O wa nibẹ.
So much so that it costs money.	Pupọ julọ o jẹ owo naa.
Others have done this before.	Awọn miiran ti ṣe eyi tẹlẹ.
But neither life.	Ṣugbọn bẹni igbesi aye.
Well most of them.	Daradara julọ ninu wọn.
I was forced to change.	Mo ti fi agbara mu lati yipada.
Feel free to tell others how you can find them.	Lero lati sọ fun awọn miiran bi o ṣe le rii wọn.
This is very true.	Eyi jẹ otitọ pupọ.
There, he put his head to rest.	Nibẹ, o gbe ori rẹ si isinmi.
I feel for him.	Mo lero fun u.
I am happy about what you did.	Inu mi dun nipa ohun ti o ṣe.
Missing parents.	Awọn obi ti o padanu.
So my question remains.	Nitorina ibeere mi tun duro.
Problems with your hands?	Awọn iṣoro pẹlu ọwọ rẹ?
I find, however, calling it.	Mo rii, sibẹsibẹ, pe rẹ.
I would say to love yourself.	Emi yoo sọ pe ki o nifẹ ara rẹ.
I did not ask any questions at all.	Nko beere ibeere kankan rara.
I do not want you to take them out of my hands.	Emi ko fẹ ki o mu wọn kuro ni ọwọ mi.
He began to ask his own questions.	O bẹrẹ lati beere awọn ibeere tirẹ.
Or your father.	Tabi baba rẹ.
You have to be in the best possible way.	O ni lati wa ni ọna ti o dara julọ.
We just talk on the phone, do so.	A kan sọrọ lori foonu, ṣe bẹ bẹ.
He said he just bought this boat.	O sọ pe o kan ra ọkọ oju omi yii.
Or so to speak.	Tabi ki o so.
The name is everything.	Orukọ jẹ ohun gbogbo.
We do not look at each other.	A ko wo ara wa.
I can not.	Emi ko le.
As decided.	Bi o ti pinnu.
We can all.	Gbogbo wa le.
He refuses to do anything.	O kọ lati ṣe ohunkohun.
We hurry to get.	A yara lati gba.
Maybe they kept their word.	Boya wọn pa ọrọ wọn mọ.
He always took himself with them.	O mu ara rẹ pẹlu wọn nigbagbogbo.
I am also the same person.	Emi tun jẹ eniyan kanna.
For a week you are in a special position.	Fun ọsẹ kan o wa ni ipo pataki kan.
He is very angry.	O binu gaan.
We are angry and afraid.	A binu ati bẹru.
She is a woman, not a girl.	Obinrin ni, kii ṣe ọmọbirin.
That is not for him to decide.	Iyẹn kii ṣe fun u lati pinnu.
Home will not appear.	Ile kii yoo han.
The deadline has passed.	Akoko ipari ti kọja.
I don’t think you are doing anything to hurt me.	Emi ko ro pe o n ṣe ohunkohun lati ṣe ipalara mi.
Others do not believe it.	Awọn miiran ko gbagbọ rẹ.
Great lesson for teachers.	Ẹkọ nla fun awọn olukọ.
The river.	Oju odo.
You must have had a hard week.	O gbọdọ ti ni ọsẹ lile kan.
I think this is a good idea.	Mo ro pe eyi jẹ imọran to dara.
It takes a while.	O n gba diẹ.
See what we have.	Wo ohun ti a ni.
I will come to you.	Emi yoo wa ba ọ.
A man was jumped by a group of teenagers.	Ọkunrin kan ti fo nipasẹ ẹgbẹ kan ti awọn ọdọ.
However, it is possible.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ṣee ṣe.
We have never been in a situation like this before.	A ko tii ni ipo bii eyi tẹlẹ.
There is nothing beyond that.	Ko si nkan ti o kọja iyẹn.
Let's work together for families.	Jẹ ki a ṣiṣẹ papọ fun awọn idile.
He was moving things around.	O n gbe ohun ni ayika.
It was a great day.	O je kan nla ọjọ.
You have received your monthly item.	O ti gba nkan oṣu rẹ.
But, we will miss a lot.	Ṣugbọn, a yoo padanu pupọ.
It was something that made her whole life.	O je ohun ti o ṣe rẹ gbogbo aye.
He arrived an hour ago.	O de wakati kan sẹhin.
But two things.	Sugbon nkan meji.
When power goes out, power goes out.	Nigbati agbara ba jade, agbara yoo jade.
It’s not that you won’t exist.	Kii ṣe pe iwọ kii yoo tẹlẹ.
I got through it.	Mo ti gba nipasẹ rẹ.
The first person to like it.	Ẹni akọkọ ti o fẹran rẹ.
I do, you say to yourself.	Mo ṣe, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
It takes children.	O gba awọn ọmọde.
There are many others.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran wa.
They boarded the train when it pulled into the station.	Wọn wọ ọkọ oju irin naa nigbati o fa sinu ibudo naa.
I decided to try to improve in my career.	Mo pinnu lati gbiyanju lati dara si ni iṣẹ mi.
Always wait to see what is new.	Duro nigbagbogbo lati wo kini tuntun.
Very well done.	Gan daradara ṣe.
I knew they arrested me.	Mo mọ pe wọn mu mi.
You can hear the sound, but no picture.	O le gbọ ohun, ṣugbọn ko si aworan.
Profit from this project is not important.	Ere lati inu iṣẹ yii ko ṣe pataki.
I am happy to see them back.	Inu mi dun lati rii wọn pada.
The accident happened when they called for help.	Ijamba naa ṣẹlẹ nigbati wọn pe fun iranlọwọ.
I will not leave after two weeks.	Emi kii yoo lọ lẹhin ọsẹ meji.
And it is so, very much.	Ati pe o jẹ bẹ, pupọ.
He put himself in the house.	O fi ara rẹ sinu ile.
But you will miss a lot of things.	Ṣugbọn iwọ yoo padanu ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
Let’s re-invest our money in our children.	Jẹ ki a tun fi owo wa sinu awọn ọmọ wa.
Most of them are there.	Ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn wa nibẹ.
You know how little the boys are.	O mọ bi awọn ọmọkunrin kekere ṣe jẹ.
These people are very wrong.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi jẹ aṣiṣe pupọ.
I will make sure it is well cared for.	Emi yoo rii pe a tọju rẹ daradara.
The boy could not say the time.	Ọmọkunrin ko le sọ akoko naa.
I would say we are together for the most part.	Emi yoo sọ pe a wa papọ fun pupọ julọ rẹ.
Believe them, even if their story sounds interesting to you.	Gba wọn gbọ, paapaa ti itan wọn ba dun fun ọ.
It has been a minute.	O ti jẹ iṣẹju kan.
What is best for you and me.	Kini o dara julọ fun iwọ ati emi.
Of course it is obvious.	Dajudaju o han gbangba.
No, it was a long time after that.	Rara, o jẹ igba pipẹ lẹhin iyẹn.
Thus, people do not know where to get that.	Bayi, eniyan ko mọ ibi ti lati gba pe.
Lift your legs up.	Gbe awọn ẹsẹ rẹ soke.
He did not think that day would come.	Ko ro pe ọjọ yii yoo de.
He is not a small dog.	Oun kii ṣe aja kekere kan.
Good times.	Awọn akoko dara.
In fact, it is a good company.	Ni otitọ, o jẹ ile-iṣẹ ti o dara.
Only to end there.	Nikan lati pari nibẹ.
This works well for me.	Eyi ṣiṣẹ daradara fun mi.
He walks the streets of this world to give love away.	O rin awọn opopona ti aye yii lati fun ifẹ kuro.
But he did not want to play this game with him.	Ṣugbọn ko fẹ lati ṣe ere yii pẹlu rẹ.
You don’t have to see any of it.	Ko ni lati ri eyikeyi ninu rẹ.
Be the first to own.	Jẹ akọkọ lati ara.
I can't have it.	Emi ko le ni.
Someone takes time.	Ẹnikan gba akoko.
They gave birth to a son.	Wọn bi ọmọkunrin kan.
But in the end, it didn’t work at all.	Ṣugbọn ni ipari, ko ṣiṣẹ rara.
I don’t know much of those people.	Emi ko mọ pupọ julọ awọn eniyan yẹn.
The meeting went into recess again.	Ipade naa tun lọ sinu isinmi lẹẹkansi.
He loves his game.	O nifẹ ere rẹ.
We'll see how it goes.	A yoo rii bi o ṣe lọ.
Scroll with it.	Yi lọ pẹlu rẹ.
Same as me.	Kanna bi emi.
Now everyone does.	Bayi gbogbo eniyan ṣe.
I want to go places.	Mo fẹ lati lọ si awọn aaye.
You are not alone.	Kii ṣe iwọ nikan.
They want you to go and you can see.	Wọn fẹ ki o lọ ati pe o le rii.
Leave the phone and go to sleep now.	Fi foonu silẹ ki o lọ sun ni bayi.
It doesn't taste good.	Ko dun dun.
This is an important lesson.	Eyi jẹ ẹkọ pataki.
Good for him.	O dara fun u.
I also know.	Mo tun mọ.
It was everything to me.	O je ohun gbogbo fun mi.
I think life grows in me.	Mo ro pe igbesi aye dagba ni inu mi.
Not a good idea.	Kii ṣe imọran to dara.
Just walk away.	O kan rin kuro.
But it seems that many of them are vulnerable.	Ṣugbọn o dabi pe ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn ni ipalara.
He looked at one face.	O wo oju kan.
He will not look at me.	Ko ni wo mi.
It is true, however.	O jẹ otitọ, sibẹsibẹ.
They just don’t mean.	Wọn kan ko tumọ si.
The purpose of this thing is to do this.	Idi ti nkan yii ni lati ṣe eyi.
He did not want them to see.	Ko fe wọn lati ri.
That's fine with you.	Iyẹn dara pẹlu rẹ.
In fact they should do less.	Ni otitọ wọn yẹ ki o ṣe kere si.
This is completely possible.	Eyi ṣee ṣe patapata.
His body changed.	Ara rẹ yipada.
One can put this in another way.	Ọkan le fi eyi si ọna miiran.
There is something amazing about them.	Nkankan wa ti iyalẹnu nipa wọn.
This is true for everyone.	Eyi jẹ otitọ fun gbogbo eniyan.
See how that works for a long time.	Wo bi iyẹn ṣe n ṣiṣẹ fun igba pipẹ.
But that never left him.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko fi i silẹ rara.
Good pick up.	Ti o dara gbe soke.
The question bothers me.	Ibeere naa dun mi.
Please help us to continue to help them.	Jọwọ ran wa lọwọ lati tẹsiwaju lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun wọn.
It doesn’t help anyone in the long run.	Ko ṣe iranlọwọ fun ẹnikan ni igba pipẹ.
Her brother is too.	Arakunrin rẹ ni o tun.
To just let it go.	Lati kan jẹ ki o lọ.
He has no dog.	Ko ni aja.
It was nothing to him.	Ko jẹ nkankan fun u.
But there is so much more than that.	Ṣugbọn o wa pupọ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
Be there with friends.	Wa nibẹ pẹlu awọn ọrẹ.
These two people and their children let it happen.	Awọn eniyan meji wọnyi ati awọn ọmọ wọn jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
But as you say.	Ṣugbọn bi o ti sọ.
It will not happen.	Kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
I went back and told my husband.	Mo pada lọ sọ fun ọkọ mi.
But if you take the time to.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba gba akoko lati.
Sometimes the hands move on their own.	Nigba miiran awọn ọwọ n gbe ti ara wọn.
I hate making decisions.	Mo korira ṣiṣe awọn ipinnu.
Dogs are known to be the best friend of man.	Awọn aja ni a mọ lati jẹ ọrẹ to dara julọ ti eniyan.
This is my test work.	Eyi ni iṣẹ idanwo mi.
If you like, please eat.	Ti o ba fẹ, jọwọ jẹun.
Okay, you didn’t pick up.	O dara, iwọ ko gbe soke.
You’re trying to feel good about yourself.	O n gbiyanju lati lero dara nipa ara rẹ.
And he worried her.	Ati pe o ṣe aniyan rẹ.
An even bigger one.	Nla kan paapaa.
We are not over yet.	A ko kọja sibẹsibẹ.
I have enough.	Mo ti ni to.
Or in the industry.	Tabi ni ile ise.
What happened here is very important.	Ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nibi ṣe pataki pupọ.
This is enough for most people, but not all.	Eyi to fun ọpọlọpọ eniyan, ṣugbọn kii ṣe gbogbo.
You can always find stories.	O le wa awọn itan nigbagbogbo.
It doesn't make sense to me.	Ko ṣe ori fun mi.
In fact, we need both.	Ni otitọ, a nilo awọn mejeeji.
He didn’t say anything to me these days.	Ko sọ ohunkohun fun mi ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
You know what people expect from you.	O mọ ohun ti eniyan n reti lati ọdọ rẹ.
You’re really buying it.	O ti n ṣe ifẹ si ni otitọ.
Every few minutes your phone rings.	Ni gbogbo iṣẹju diẹ foonu rẹ dun.
He is a good friend.	O jẹ ọrẹ to dara.
We cannot continue.	A ko le tẹsiwaju.
Get up, he said.	Dide, o sọ.
I would like to sleep well at night.	Emi yoo fẹ lati sun daradara ni alẹ.
No one takes these seriously.	Ko si ọkan mu awọn wọnyi ni pataki.
Such a person.	Iru eniyan bẹẹ.
It is a small town.	Ilu kekere ni.
We need to find them.	A nilo lati wa wọn.
I have no interest in that at all.	Emi ko ni anfani rara ni iyẹn.
Two are important.	Meji ṣe pataki.
I'm sorry.	Ma binu aja.
He kept his name.	O pa orukọ rẹ.
Keep walking because of what else you can do.	Pa rin nitori kini ohun miiran ti o le ṣe.
My question is who will believe you.	Ibeere mi ni tani yoo gba ọ gbọ.
It’s time for a test.	O to akoko ti o ni idanwo.
All these things and more.	Gbogbo nkan wọnyi ati diẹ sii.
She ate well.	O jẹun daradara.
Now, let’s see what else we miss here.	Bayi, jẹ ki a wo kini ohun miiran ti a padanu nibi.
Only two thirds.	Nikan meji ninu mẹta.
I'm glad no one saw that.	Inu mi dun pe ko si ẹnikan ti o rii iyẹn.
We spent a lot of time with them.	A lo akoko pupọ pẹlu wọn.
He considered his home to be his great home.	O ka ile rẹ si bi ile nla rẹ.
Who did this?	Tani o ṣe eyi?
But it was not what he wanted to play with today.	Sugbon o je ko ohun ti o fe lati mu pẹlu loni.
You can not reach the house.	O ko le de ile naa.
There is a world beyond the world of my people.	Aye kan wa ti o kọja aye awọn eniyan mi.
You can never be sure.	O ko le ni idaniloju rara.
I will pay for everything.	Emi yoo san fun ohun gbogbo.
It’s amazing, amazing.	O jẹ iyalẹnu, iyalẹnu.
Or first.	Tabi akọkọ.
Don’t expect too much from this place.	Maṣe nireti pupọ lati ibi yii.
I don't really want to know.	Emi ko fẹ lati mọ gaan.
I hope you can feel it.	Mo nireti pe o le lero rẹ.
We read for several hours before going to sleep.	A ka fun ọpọlọpọ awọn wakati ṣaaju ki o to sun oorun.
I can't tell you why.	Emi ko le sọ idi rẹ fun ọ.
Everything is going well on this side.	Ohun gbogbo n lọ daradara ni ẹgbẹ yii.
The sister is beautiful without her.	Arabinrin naa dara julọ laisi rẹ.
Always here?	Wa nibi nigbagbogbo?
Again, remember that these tasks are very simple.	Lẹẹkansi, ranti pe awọn iṣẹ wọnyi rọrun pupọ.
The woman in question has not yet arrived.	Obinrin ti o ni ibeere ko ti de.
Doesn't look pretty much.	Ko wo ni lẹwa diẹ sii.
Wanting to return home, we do.	Fẹ lati pada si ile, a ṣe.
He had his whole family with him.	O ni gbogbo idile rẹ pẹlu rẹ.
That would be nice.	Iyẹn yoo dara.
This happens a lot.	Eyi ṣẹlẹ pupọ.
If you go with a question think about such.	Ti o ba lọ pẹlu ibeere kan ro nipa iru.
If you want to meet her good with us.	Ti o ba fẹ pade rẹ o dara pẹlu wa.
I don’t think so.	Emi ko ro pe o kan.
Learn everything you can about them.	Kọ ẹkọ ohun gbogbo ti o le nipa wọn.
Do good things.	Ṣe awọn ohun ti o dara.
And you can be yourself around it.	Ati pe o le jẹ ara rẹ ni ayika rẹ.
You need the money.	O nilo owo naa.
He asked around.	O ti beere ni ayika.
It will continue for the next several weeks.	Yoo tẹsiwaju fun awọn ọsẹ pupọ ti nbọ.
I accept you, my friend.	Mo ti gba ọ, ọrẹ mi.
Whether or not it is celebrated.	Boya tabi kii ṣe ayẹyẹ.
I have nothing to say.	Nko so nkankan mo.
This may be my advantage.	Eyi le jẹ anfani mi.
That is the truth given.	Otitọ ti a fun niyẹn.
I don’t even have a name for his height.	Emi ko paapaa ni orukọ fun giga rẹ.
There’s a reason he didn’t start that season.	Idi kan wa ti ko fi bẹrẹ akoko naa.
I will remember.	Emi yoo ranti.
You come to the office looking for a job.	O wa si ọfiisi n wa iṣẹ kan.
If they do, they will stop.	Ti wọn ba ṣe, wọn yoo duro.
He gives you one if you want.	O fi ọkan fun ọ ti o ba fẹ.
I stopped myself a lot.	Mo da ara mi duro pupọ.
They do not look happy.	Won ko wo inu dun.
Not so much here, but.	Ko ki Elo nibi, ṣugbọn.
It is very efficient.	O jẹ julọ daradara.
Nor is he.	Tabi oun kii ṣe.
He shook his head, angry at himself, and tried again.	O mi ori, o binu si ara rẹ, o tun gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
Just work your way up.	Kan ṣiṣẹ iru rẹ.
You have never met her.	O ti ko pade rẹ.
But that is the name of the game.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ni orukọ ere naa.
The police love to work with children.	Ọlọpa naa nifẹ ṣiṣẹ pẹlu awọn ọmọde.
You should be very angry.	O yẹ ki o binu pupọ.
It can be worn indoors or outdoors.	O le wọ ninu ile tabi ita.
But he does not seem to mind.	Ṣugbọn o dabi ẹni pe ko ni aniyan.
Many have not heard of these places.	Ọpọlọpọ ko tii gbọ ti awọn aaye wọnyi.
I also think you add to it, whatever you say.	Mo tun ro pe o fi kun si, ohunkohun ti o sọ.
Maybe you are asleep.	Boya o ti sun.
Not so here.	A ko ri bẹ nibi.
I get under the bed and put it on.	Mo gba labẹ ibusun mo si fi sii.
There is something else you have to do first.	Ohun miiran wa ti o ni lati ṣe akọkọ.
But you must know.	Ṣugbọn o gbọdọ mọ.
He does not want his children to grow up in such an environment.	Ko fẹ ki awọn ọmọ rẹ dagba ni iru agbegbe bẹẹ.
And we should.	Ati pe a yẹ.
No, not much.	Rara, kii ṣe pupọ lọ.
But maybe this is a mistake.	Ṣugbọn boya eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
And there is no other sense.	Ati pe ko si ori miiran.
This is what we are looking for in the coming months.	Eyi ni ohun ti a wa ni awọn oṣu to nbọ.
He understood well, and took it out.	O loye daradara, o si mu jade.
At least he never left home with them.	O kere ju ko ti lọ kuro ni ile pẹlu wọn.
Not what they used to.	Kii ṣe ohun ti wọn lo lati.
Most of these work well.	Ọpọlọpọ ninu awọn wọnyi ṣiṣẹ daradara.
He has no place to go.	Ko ni aaye lati lọ.
he asked.	o beere.
And you love the idea.	Ati pe o nifẹ imọran naa.
Just go to work.	Kan lọ si iṣẹ.
He wants to move out.	O fe lati gbe jade.
You know how this happened and why.	O mọ bi eyi ṣe ṣẹlẹ ati idi ti.
They will need space to stay.	Wọn yoo nilo aaye lati duro.
I will be happy.	Inu mi yoo dun si.
At least they gave him that.	Ni o kere wọn fun u pe.
If you stay around long enough.	Ti o ba duro ni ayika gun to.
You can not sleep.	O ko le sun.
Contact a doctor.	Kan si dokita kan.
And personal stories.	Ati awọn itan ti ara ẹni.
There is a reason we all end up jumping off.	Idi kan wa ti gbogbo wa pari soke fo kuro.
I'm afraid it's right.	Mo bẹru pe o tọ.
No one said a word.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ọrọ kan.
No information can.	Ko si alaye le.
It is impossible to say this.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati sọ eyi.
One we have seen.	Ọkan ti a ti ri.
So, a lot.	Nitorina, pupọ.
In the end he thought he won.	Ni ipari o ro pe o gba.
You go to work and do your job.	O lọ si iṣẹ ati ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
You have, however, watched it.	O ti, sibẹsibẹ, ti wo o.
It is near your feet.	O wa nitosi ẹsẹ rẹ.
He decided it was time to call one day.	O pinnu pe o to akoko lati pe ni ọjọ kan.
You have killed them.	O ti pa wọn.
My team didn't work.	Ẹgbẹ mi ko ṣiṣẹ.
My brother is in town.	Arakunrin mi ni ilu.
There will be time for that, you know.	Akoko yoo wa fun iyẹn, o mọ.
It doesn’t work as it goes, of course.	Ko ṣe iṣẹ bi o ti n lọ, dajudaju.
I met him last night.	Mo pade rẹ ni alẹ ana.
I haven't tried it before.	Emi ko gbiyanju rẹ tẹlẹ.
It makes it easier.	O mu ki o rọrun.
Meet the man's face.	Pade oju ọkunrin naa.
You know, if you have a feeling.	O mọ, ti o ba ni rilara.
Well, his body has never been seen before.	O dara, ara rẹ ko tii ri.
Others have nothing and no one.	Awọn miiran ko ni nkankan ko si si ẹnikan.
Do not rush to leave the party.	Maṣe yara lati lọ kuro ni ayẹyẹ naa.
I was just wondering.	Mo kan iyalẹnu.
Would be happy to help.	Yoo dun lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
If something happens, it happens.	Ti nkan kan ba ṣẹlẹ, o ṣẹlẹ.
Now the thing is in a difficult situation.	Bayi ohun naa wa ni ipo lile.
Just see it for yourself, and see what happens.	Kan wo o fun ara rẹ, ki o wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
This could be forever.	Eyi le jẹ lailai.
I was told we would have to get out soon.	A sọ fun mi pe a yoo ni lati jade laipẹ.
Not even his mother.	Ko paapaa iya rẹ.
I was very scared.	Mo bẹru pupọ.
Know, in particular, where and how to walk.	Mọ, paapaa, nibo ati bi o ṣe n rin.
Essentially, think about it.	Ni pataki, ronu nipa rẹ.
So you can stay home for a while.	Nitorina o le wa ni ile fun igba diẹ.
Read any book you want.	Ka eyikeyi iwe ti o fẹ.
The girls will come to you.	Awọn ọmọbirin yoo wa si ọdọ rẹ.
It seemed good.	O dabi enipe o dara.
Pull it back a little.	Fa rẹ pada diẹ.
You have to stay home.	O ni lati duro si ile.
But it is still not the same.	Sugbon o jẹ ṣi ko kanna.
Can't say their names.	Ko le sọ awọn orukọ wọn.
And yet, many people treat it.	Ati sibẹsibẹ, ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan tọju rẹ.
Do not read, think!	Maṣe sọ ka, ronu!
They do not want anything else.	Won ko ba ko fẹ ohunkohun miiran.
I like the wonders of life.	Mo bi iyanu ti aye.
But he has other men.	Ṣugbọn o ni awọn ọkunrin miiran.
They are all citizens.	Gbogbo ilu ni wọn.
He is very tired.	O ti re pupo.
I'm very tired now.	O rẹ mi pupọ ni bayi.
That you accept.	Pe o gba.
The car slept in another room.	Ọkọ sun ninu yara miiran.
It is a very simple matter.	O jẹ ọrọ ti o rọrun pupọ.
You get the point.	O gba aaye naa.
It's just tea.	A kan tii ni.
It’s their way of being too late.	O jẹ ọna wọn lati pẹ ju.
I look forward to the celebration.	Mo nireti si ayẹyẹ naa.
He is just looking at us.	O kan n wo wa.
We have it before, and we can have it again.	A ni o ṣaaju ki o to, ati awọn ti a le ni lẹẹkansi.
Man in front changed.	Eniyan ni iwaju yipada.
You should just leave now.	O yẹ ki o kan kuro ni bayi.
At least in one job.	O kere ju ni iṣẹ kan.
Is there any way to do that.	Njẹ ọna eyikeyi wa lati ṣe iyẹn.
I especially like the classes and the little sun.	Mo fẹran paapaa awọn kilasi ati oorun kekere.
It's an opportunity.	O ni anfani.
I was there for a while.	Mo wa nibẹ fun akoko kan.
They know as soon as it happens.	Wọn mọ ni kete ti o ṣẹlẹ.
I will use that amount.	Emi yoo lo iye yẹn.
You will be very good when you finish.	Iwọ yoo dara pupọ nigbati o ba pari.
What works for some will of course not work for others.	Ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ fun diẹ ninu yoo dajudaju ko ṣiṣẹ fun awọn miiran.
Of course not the first group.	Dajudaju kii ṣe ẹgbẹ akọkọ.
I am receiving it tomorrow.	Mo n gba mi ni ọla.
Things must be heard.	Awọn ohun gbọdọ gbọ.
If you really want games to build one.	Ti o ba fẹ gaan fun awọn ere kọ ọkan.
I want to work with you.	Mo fẹ lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
Maybe a lot.	Boya pupọ.
That is very simple.	Iyẹn jẹ rọrun pupọ.
Not just for me, but for anyone.	Kii ṣe fun mi nikan, ṣugbọn fun ẹnikẹni.
In and out like that.	Ninu ati jade bi iyẹn.
They stay like this for a long time.	Wọn duro bii eyi fun igba pipẹ.
People will come and go.	Eniyan yoo wa ki o lọ.
It is a force that we all have.	O jẹ agbara ti gbogbo wa ni.
They try to pull you down.	Wọn gbiyanju lati fa ọ silẹ.
I still love you.	Mo nifẹ rẹ sibẹsibẹ.
I want to see your work.	Mo fe ri ise re.
The metal is also very hot	Irin naa tun gbona pupọ
The seasons maybe have the better of them.	Awọn akoko boya ni awọn dara ti wọn.
It will hurt you, but it is true.	Yoo ṣe ipalara fun ọ, ṣugbọn otitọ ni.
You have not had to.	O ti ko ni lati.

Today he told me his reason.	Loni o sọ idi rẹ fun mi.
It's hot inside.	O gbona ninu.
He closed his eyes.	O di oju rẹ.
Sometimes we laugh a lot.	Nigba miiran a rẹrin pupọ.
He hated his thoughts.	O korira ero rẹ.
Maybe two or three.	Boya meji tabi mẹta.
I can continue talking.	Mo le tẹsiwaju sọrọ.
I had a lot of trouble trying to do this.	Mo ni wahala nla lati gbiyanju lati ṣe eyi.
Soon, they will come to you.	Laipẹ, wọn yoo wa si ọdọ rẹ.
Some people do not agree.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ko gba.
I am your wife now.	Emi ni iyawo re bayi.
His face did not change, they were the same.	Oju rẹ ko yipada, wọn jẹ kanna.
She sat on the bed.	O joko lori ibusun.
The next morning.	Owurọ ti nbọ.
Not much, but some.	Kii ṣe pupọ, ṣugbọn diẹ ninu.
All you have to do is ask me.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ni lati ṣe ni beere lọwọ mi.
Obviously it has something going for it.	O han ni o ni nkankan ti o lọ fun o.
As you may know.	Bi o ṣe le mọ.
I have no books.	Nko ni iwe kankan.
Possibly today.	O ṣee ṣe loni.
They also make breakfast every morning.	Wọn tun ṣe ounjẹ owurọ ni gbogbo owurọ.
He got into the car of his own love.	O wa sinu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti ifẹ tirẹ.
When you feel that there is nothing there.	Nigbati o ba lero pe ko si nkankan nibẹ.
She is a member of my family.	O jẹ ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti idile mi.
I paid for it.	Mo ti san fun u.
I will never forget your promise.	Emi ko ni gbagbe ileri re.
But it is fun.	Sugbon o jẹ fun.
One can get it.	Ẹnikan le gba a.
It can't be.	Ko le jẹ.
Stand there, behind the bar.	Duro nibẹ, lẹhin igi naa.
If not, at any point, live with a child or mother.	Ti ko, ni eyikeyi aaye, gbe pẹlu ọmọ tabi iya.
But get what you can.	Ṣugbọn gba ohun ti o le.
The company washed their hands of the accident.	Ile-iṣẹ naa wẹ ọwọ wọn ti ijamba naa.
This will give me and your father a chance to talk.	Eyi yoo fun emi ati baba rẹ ni anfani lati sọrọ.
He rented a big house in the city.	O ya ile nla kan ni ilu naa.
Or who is trying to pick it up.	Tabi tani o gbiyanju lati gbe soke.
And you want to give him a good idea last night.	Ati pe o fẹ fun u ni imọran ti o dara ni alẹ ana.
I treat other situations, especially.	Mo tọju awọn ipo miiran, paapaa.
Ask him out well.	Beere lọwọ rẹ.
She loves travel.	O nifẹ irin-ajo.
We have time.	A ni akoko.
They do not have enough to eat.	Wọn ko ni to lati jẹun.
I can't remember the last time that happened.	Emi ko le ranti igba ikẹhin ti o ṣẹlẹ.
But that is also good news.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn tun jẹ iroyin ti o dara.
Open it again.	Ṣi i lẹẹkansi.
What kind of environment is that.	Iru ayika ti ohun naa wa.
They should be better than forgotten.	Wọn yẹ dara ju ki a gbagbe lọ.
You will not do what you do.	O ko ni ṣe ohun ti o ṣe.
I have never seen him and he is.	Emi ko tii ri i ati pe o wa.
I was serious about my marriage.	Mo ṣe pataki nipa igbeyawo mi.
I think so mean and small.	Mo ro bẹ tumọ ati kekere.
The driver asked for help.	Awakọ naa beere fun iranlọwọ.
You will also need to use it like everyone else.	Iwọ yoo tun nilo lati lo bi gbogbo eniyan miiran.
At this time, he did not let the child go.	Ni akoko yii, ko jẹ ki ọmọ naa lọ.
The bus station is nearby.	Ibudo ọkọ akero wa nitosi.
You hide your name across the back of the picture.	O pa orukọ rẹ kọja ẹhin aworan naa.
I do not want to see this happen.	Emi ko fẹ lati ri yi ṣẹlẹ.
It has always happened to me.	O ti ṣẹlẹ si mi nigbagbogbo.
The program is gone.	Eto naa ti lọ.
It would not be surprising, no.	Kii yoo jẹ iyalẹnu, rara.
He’s broken most of the time.	O si ti fọ julọ ti awọn akoko.
Say that to a mother on help.	Sọ iyẹn fun iya iya kan lori iranlọwọ.
I have to tell someone, anyone.	Mo ni lati sọ fun ẹnikan, ẹnikẹni.
We have enjoyed our time in your family.	A ti gbadun akoko wa ninu idile rẹ.
They work as you expect them to work.	Wọn ṣiṣẹ bi o ṣe nireti pe wọn yoo ṣiṣẹ.
But both happened.	Ṣugbọn awọn mejeeji ṣẹlẹ.
But this is too much for me to understand.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ pupọ fun mi lati loye.
Everyone hopes they will.	Gbogbo eniyan nireti pe wọn yoo ṣe.
People have to take holidays.	Awọn eniyan ni lati ya awọn ọjọ isinmi.
People have brought it out.	Eniyan ti mu u jade.
You have to learn how to eat yourself.	O ni lati kọ ẹkọ bi o ṣe le jẹun ara rẹ.
That is to change this year.	Iyẹn ni lati yipada ni ọdun yii.
I heard the first word of any of them.	Mo gbọ ọrọ akọkọ ti eyikeyi ninu wọn sọ.
A little more.	Diẹ diẹ.
They do not have to say the words.	Wọn ko ni lati sọ awọn ọrọ naa.
One of the costs.	Ọkan ninu awọn owo.
Okay, you can come.	O dara, o le wa.
He did not like the place at all.	Ko fẹran ibi naa rara.
The love of her parents took her here, she said.	Ifẹ awọn obi rẹ mu u nibi, o sọ.
He had told me that they deserved to die.	O ti sọ fun mi pe wọn yẹ lati ku.
Well, the details are not important.	O dara, awọn alaye ko ṣe pataki.
Thanks so much!.	O se gan ni!.
I do not know where their bodies are.	Emi ko mọ ibi ti ara wọn wa.
All we can do is do the best we can.	Gbogbo ohun ti a le ṣe ni kan ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara julọ ti a le.
No external equipment required.	Ko si ohun elo ita ti o nilo.
You can see that.	O le rii iyẹn.
This is the sea.	Eyi ni okun.
They have impossible names.	Wọn ni awọn orukọ ti ko ṣeeṣe.
They may have finished their game.	Wọn le ti pari ere wọn.
Think big here.	Ronu nla nibi.
Not this thing or that thing.	Kii ṣe nkan yii tabi nkan yẹn.
My legs are open.	Awọn ẹsẹ mi ti n ṣii.

Maybe only for a minute, to show someone.	Boya nikan fun iṣẹju kan, lati fi ẹnikan han.
It is not going to happen again.	Ko lilọ si ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
He looked up.	O wo soke.

We see them laughing.	A ri wọn n rẹrin.
Listen to the whole story.	Gbọ gbogbo itan naa.
It depends.	O da lori rẹ.

He doesn't seem angry.	O dabi pe ko binu.
I have to find help.	Mo ni lati wa iranlọwọ.
None of our ideas.	Ko si ninu awọn ero wa.

He left the door open.	O fi ilẹkun silẹ ni gbangba.
All these questions.	Gbogbo awọn ibeere wọnyi.
At any given day.	Ni eyikeyi fi fun ọjọ.
I want to take off my clothes.	Mo fẹ lati bọ aṣọ mi kuro.
We are good friends this morning.	A jẹ ọrẹ to dara ni owurọ yii.
He worries that he will be too late.	O ni aniyan pe oun yoo pẹ ju.
When your body beats up, you can’t change.	Nigbati ara rẹ ba lu soke, o ko le yipada.
And they can't think, they just believe.	Ati pe wọn ko le ronu, wọn kan gbagbọ.
You have a lot of them.	O ni ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn.
For us to be friends.	Fun wa lati wa ni ọrẹ.

You need to hear the truth.	O nilo lati gbọ otitọ.
You know all the time.	O mọ ni gbogbo igba.
Why are you upset?	Kini idi ti inu rẹ ko dun?
So tell me.	Nitorina sọ fun mi.
You can not stay here!	O ko le duro nibi!
Neither of those.	Bẹni ti awon.
And your interest will probably naturally come across.	Ati awọn rẹ anfani yoo jasi nipa ti wa kọja.
Invite others to the home.	Pe awọn miiran si ile.
We are standing together.	A n duro papọ.
And add more.	Ki o si fi diẹ sii.
And in the end, he lost.	Ati ni ipari, o padanu.
We ask for everyone.	A beere fun gbogbo eniyan.
Tell people on the road.	Sọ fun eniyan ni opopona.
See how they look up and down.	Wo bi wọn ṣe n wo soke ati isalẹ.
What are the benefits?	Kini awọn anfani?
He is not angry at all.	E ma binu rara.
That or he may have done something wrong.	Iyẹn tabi o le ti ṣe nkan ti ko tọ.
Just get through the action and have a good time.	Kan gba nipasẹ iṣẹ naa ki o ni akoko ti o dara.
They are not easy to read.	Wọn ko rọrun lati ka.
You can not understand why he is angry.	O ko le loye idi ti o fi binu.
I agree with that information.	Mo gba pẹlu alaye yẹn.
He turned into a man and a woman.	O yipada si ọkunrin kan ati obinrin.
I stay for the whole year.	Mo duro fun gbogbo odun.
Do not read too much into this.	Maṣe ka pupọ sinu eyi.
The family moved out of town.	Ebi gbe kuro ni ilu.
I am flying everywhere.	Mo n fo ni gbogbo ibi.
He learned a lot from his father.	O kọ ẹkọ pupọ lati ọdọ baba rẹ.
That is possible of course.	Iyẹn ṣee ṣe dajudaju.
You have to write.	O ni lati kọ.
Turn the heat down.	Yi ooru si isalẹ.
If it doesn’t sound right to you, something might go wrong.	Ti ko ba dun si ọ, ohun kan le jẹ aṣiṣe.
Something bad would have happened by now.	Nkankan buburu yoo ti ṣẹlẹ nipasẹ bayi.
So you have to know.	Nitorina o ni lati mọ.
It makes everything else understandable.	O jẹ ki ohun gbogbo miiran jẹ oye.
In fact, they are not allowed to even be here.	Ni otitọ, wọn ko gba wọn laaye lati paapaa wa nibi.
Look, we are almost done!	Wo, a ti fẹrẹ pari!
He knew he had no intention of paying for it.	O mọ pe o ko ni ero lati san fun u.
I promise you.	Mo se ileri fun e.
O di o mu.	O di o mu.

He knew he wouldn’t believe it, of course.	O mọ pe ko ni gbagbọ, dajudaju.
Too much for you to be serious about.	Pupọ pupọ fun o lati ṣe pataki.
There is nothing to do now.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣe ni bayi.
I stood there watching him.	Mo duro nibẹ ti n wo rẹ.
I know the problem is through it.	Mo mọ pe iṣoro naa jẹ nipasẹ rẹ.
This is completely out of hand.	Eyi ti jade patapata ni ọwọ.
And one more thing.	Ati ohun kan diẹ sii.
They are not lost.	Wọn ko padanu.
The truth is, no side is perfect.	Otitọ ni, ko si ẹgbẹ ti o pe.
No need to worry about rejection.	Ko nilo lati ṣe aniyan nipa kọ silẹ.
It never occurred to me that we would lose one of my daughters forever.	Ko ṣẹlẹ si mi pe a yoo padanu ọkan ninu awọn ọmọbirin mi lailai.
Try again.	Gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
He is looking for us.	O n wa fun wa.
No one is here but two of them, and bad guys.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa nibi ṣugbọn awọn meji ninu wọn, ati awọn eniyan buburu.
I can hear some of the words.	Mo le gbọ diẹ ninu awọn ọrọ naa.
Police are not important by people on the road.	Awọn ọlọpa kii ṣe pataki nipasẹ awọn eniyan ni opopona.
It can’t be yours.	Ko le jẹ rẹ.
Can't they think of another way?	Ṣe wọn ko le ronu ọna miiran bi?
Please ask us if you would like to buy.	Jọwọ beere lọwọ wa ti o ba fẹ ra.
May be more important.	Le ju pataki.
I can’t remember feeling like this before.	Emi ko le ranti rilara bi eyi tẹlẹ.
We can’t see too much of our people.	A ko le rii pupọ julọ awọn eniyan wa.
Of course I did that for him for many years.	Dajudaju Mo ṣe iyẹn fun u fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
I need money.	Mo nilo owo.
He will take me, not you.	Oun yoo gba mi, kii ṣe iwọ.
You have your own question.	O ni ibeere ti ara rẹ.
It is easy to explain what happened.	O rọrun lati ṣe alaye ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
The feeling one gets in this city.	Awọn rilara ọkan gba ni ilu yi.
The sister was fine all morning.	Arabinrin naa ti dara ni gbogbo owurọ.
Give them something to do.	Fun wọn ni nkankan lati ṣe.
I can use in class.	Mo le lo ni kilasi.
He also did not eat.	Oun naa ko jẹun.
I feel great.	Mo rilara pupọ.
Both.	Awon mejeeji.
In the end it doesn’t matter.	Ni ipari ko ṣe pataki.
We slept a lot.	A sun pupọ.
Don’t expect that to change here.	Maṣe nireti pe yoo yipada nibi.
They have had their day with me.	Wọn ti ni ọjọ wọn pẹlu mi.
He believed, for a while, in himself.	O gbagbọ, fun igba diẹ, ninu ara rẹ.
Was just under two years old.	Je o kan labẹ odun meji.
I will pay whatever you want.	Emi yoo san ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
They were used to it, too.	Won ni won lo lati o, ju.
It’s not just money.	Kii ṣe owo nikan.
Watch the game.	Wo awọn ere.
Let's go for a swim.	Jẹ ká lọ fun a we.
You may not know about it either.	O le ko mọ nipa rẹ boya.
Or use it at home.	Tabi lo ni ile.
But they did not want to.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko fẹ.
No one has come out this way.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ti jade ni ọna yii.
It’s one hard to imagine.	O jẹ ọkan lile lati ro ero.
These are our friends.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn ọrẹ wa.
We are almost out of power.	A ti fẹrẹ lọ kuro ni agbara.
I won’t let it go over my head.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki o lọ si ori mi.
He could not explain exactly why he could not sleep.	Ko le ṣe alaye ni otitọ idi ti ko le sun oorun.
The environment is not good.	Ayika ko dara.
His art is always amazing !.	Iṣẹ ọna rẹ nigbagbogbo jẹ iyalẹnu!.
There are others planned, but this is the game.	Awọn miiran wa ti a gbero, ṣugbọn eyi ni ere naa.
It could be a song.	O le jẹ orin kan.
This is the house.	Eyi ni ile naa.
On the river is one way.	Lori odo jẹ ọna kan.
Marriage and parenthood do not change this.	Igbeyawo ati obi ko yi eyi pada.
He does everything now.	O ṣe ohun gbogbo ni bayi.
At that moment he began to wonder.	Ni akoko yẹn o bẹrẹ lati ṣe iyalẹnu.
However, there are problems.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn iṣoro wa.
I was very happy when we did something back.	Inu mi dun pupọ nigbati a ṣe pada ni nkan kan.
Not true right now.	Kii ṣe otitọ ni bayi.
I just like yourself.	Mo kan fẹ ara rẹ.
You had a great time.	O ni akoko nla.
His father said nothing to him.	Baba rẹ ko sọ ohunkohun fun u.
You do not know.	O ko mọ.
I don’t think it will catch fire again.	Emi ko ro pe yoo tun mu ina lẹẹkansi.
This is our home.	Eyi ni ile wa.
Nothing can be done.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣee ṣe.
He opened the door for me with a book in his hand.	O ṣi ilẹkun fun mi pẹlu iwe kan ni ọwọ rẹ.
They do not have enough money to buy a house.	Wọn ko ni owo ti o to lati ra ile kan.
It is the body.	Ara ni.
He wished he could talk to her.	O fẹ pe o le ba a sọrọ.
You will learn how to handle hard questions about your job.	Iwọ yoo kọ ẹkọ bi o ṣe le mu awọn ibeere lile nipa iṣẹ rẹ.
Not that he would sell it.	Kii ṣe pe oun yoo ta a.
No one saw it coming.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o rii pe o nbọ.
Now the time has come.	Bayi akoko ti de.
I know how these things work.	Mo mọ bi nkan wọnyi ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
People die in these pictures.	Awọn eniyan ku ni awọn aworan wọnyi.
I am asking for water.	Mo n beere fun omi.
If you want to kill us, so be it.	Ti o ba fẹ lati pa wa, bẹ bẹ.
It seems that not everyone agrees with this.	O dabi pe kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan ti gba otitọ yii.
I turned to him.	Mo yipada si ọdọ rẹ.
Two years are gone.	Odun meji ti lọ.
The right way is to do both.	Ọna ti o tọ ni lati ṣe awọn mejeeji.
Come see.	Wa wo.
That's right.	Iyẹn tọ.
But these are not your major tests.	Ṣugbọn awọn wọnyi kii ṣe awọn idanwo pataki rẹ.
Her body felt impossible.	Ara rẹ ro pe ko ṣeeṣe.
I can't wait.	Nko le duro.
He’s always on his own, you see.	O wa nigbagbogbo ni ara rẹ, o rii.
She told him she wanted to help me.	O sọ fun u pe o fẹ ran mi lọwọ.
That’s what’s coming through.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti n bọ nipasẹ.
You can not lock me up.	O ko le tii mi soke.
He put his back into it.	O fi ẹhin sinu rẹ.
I could make out that much.	Mo ti le ṣe jade wipe Elo.
I am the mother of your birth.	Emi ni iya ibi rẹ.
When class begins, all exams will be taken.	Nigbati kilasi ba bẹrẹ, gbogbo awọn idanwo yoo gba.
Try so hard.	Gbiyanju bẹ lile.
But that doesn't say much.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko sọ pupọ.
It’s got something going on.	O ni diẹ ninu nkan ti o lọ.
Or we can't find any.	Tabi a ko le ri eyikeyi.
This sounds like it was picked up.	Eyi n dun bi a ti gbe e soke.
For the first time, you understand what the idea is.	Fun igba akọkọ, o loye kini ero jẹ.
When does the train go?	Nigbawo ni ọkọ oju irin lọ?
We have a picture.	A ni aworan.
It has been amazing to see how this group has grown.	O ti jẹ ohun iyanu lati rii bi ẹgbẹ yii ti dagba.
Stop talking now!	Duro sọrọ ni bayi!
Just contact them.	O kan si wọn.
Your word is now legal.	Ọrọ rẹ ni bayi ofin.
It has gone down.	O ti lọ si isalẹ.
All works well.	Gbogbo ṣiṣẹ daradara.
For the most part, it still looks that way today.	Fun pupọ julọ, o tun dabi ọna yẹn loni.
Everything was going to be so amazing.	Ohun gbogbo ti a ti lilọ si jẹ ki iyanu.
He lives in the water.	O n gbe ni omi.
I want to cook for a living.	Mo fẹ lati se ounjẹ fun igbesi aye.
And he departed.	O si lọ kuro.
I saw and never let on.	Mo ti ri ati ki o ko jẹ ki lori.
He rose.	O dide.
One question is about parents.	Ibeere kan jẹ nipa awọn obi.
Students should have been taught.	O yẹ ki a ti kọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe.
I just want him as my legal father.	Mo ti o kan fẹ u bi mi ofin baba.
I do not want to give anything away.	Emi ko fẹ lati fun ohunkohun kuro.
Well, you get it back.	O dara, o gba pada.
But if you are there, it will not stop.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba wa nibẹ, kii yoo duro.
On rainy days, the river was full.	Ni awọn ọjọ ti ojo nla, odo ti kun.
It will make them more anxious.	Yoo jẹ ki wọn ni aniyan diẹ sii.
Just don’t listen to us.	O kan ko gbọ wa.
This is for children.	Eyi jẹ fun awọn ọmọde.
They can also be very difficult to do.	Wọn tun le pupọ lati ṣe.
They want us to be afraid.	Wọn fẹ ki a bẹru.
Much has changed in my life.	Pupọ ti yipada ninu igbesi aye mi.
I got up in the heat of the moment.	Mo ti gba soke ninu ooru ti awọn akoko.
On many fronts.	Lori ọpọlọpọ awọn iwaju.
Get more people involved.	Gba eniyan diẹ sii lọwọ.
No, no, serious.	Rara, rara, pataki.
Anything.	Ohunkohun.
Okay, stay tuned.	O dara, o duro si.
You do not feel wrong.	O ko lero aṣiṣe.
Easy to get out, but not possible to lock behind them.	Rọrun lati jade, ṣugbọn ko ṣee ṣe lati tii lẹhin wọn.
This cannot be just about you.	Eyi ko le jẹ nipa rẹ nikan.
There is something for all ages.	Nibẹ ni nkankan fun gbogbo ọjọ ori.
However, that did not change anything.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn ko yi ohunkohun pada.
Others ask more personal questions.	Awọn miiran beere awọn ibeere ti ara ẹni diẹ sii.
Time and again, he tried.	Igba ati lẹẹkansi, o gbiyanju.
towards you.	si ọna rẹ.
That makes sense.	Iyẹn jẹ oye.
You only get paid when your company starts making money.	O gba owo nikan nigbati ile-iṣẹ rẹ bẹrẹ ṣiṣe owo.
What will happen to them is uncertain.	Ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ si wọn ko ni idaniloju.
He looks down.	O n wo isalẹ.
I tried to get her father, but it was too late.	Mo gbiyanju lati gba baba rẹ, ṣugbọn o ti pẹ ju.
Things are what is required.	Awọn ohun wa ni ohun ti a beere.
People hope to return to where they came from.	Awọn eniyan nireti lati pada si ibiti wọn ti wa.
Everything is over, in your opinion.	Ohun gbogbo ti pari, ni ero rẹ.
These ideas can also change significantly over time.	Awọn ero wọnyi tun le yipada ni pataki lori akoko.
It changed something in him.	O yipada nkankan ninu rẹ.
They are down and out.	Wọn wa ni isalẹ ati jade.
'rules.	'awọn ofin.
We have enjoyed good weather all year.	A ti gbadun oju ojo to dara ni gbogbo ọdun.
Obviously this cannot be so.	O han gbangba pe eyi ko le ri bẹ.
I love you and believe you will.	Mo nifẹ rẹ ati gbagbọ pe iwọ yoo.
That's very good.	Iyẹn dara pupọ.
He is now dead.	O ti ku bayi.
But what do you think ?.	Sugbon kini o ro?.
He told us that you would come.	O sọ fun wa pe iwọ yoo wa.
You are lost.	O ti padanu.
The whole game seems to have changed.	Gbogbo ere dabi pe o yipada.
However, it is hard.	Sibẹsibẹ, o jẹ lile.
It is often used in this book.	Nigbagbogbo a ma lo ninu iwe yii.
There are things you can do, to make things better.	Awọn ohun kan wa ti o le ṣe, lati jẹ ki awọn nkan dara.
I ask who.	Mo beere tani o.
As we get up.	Bi ati dide.
Not there.	Ko ti wa nibẹ.
You also need to mean something.	O tun nilo lati tumọ si nkankan.
They say good things about it.	Wọn sọ ohun ti o dara nipa rẹ.
With such applications, the problems are down.	Pẹlu iru awọn ohun elo, awọn iṣoro wa ni isalẹ.
He did not change and talked to him.	Ko yipada ki o ba a sọrọ.
All for one.	Gbogbo fun ọkan.
I need to make sure it matters.	Mo nilo lati rii daju pe o ṣe pataki.
Learn with me, love with me, grow with me.	Kọ ẹkọ pẹlu mi, nifẹ pẹlu mi, dagba pẹlu mi.
Sorry if we went to the wrong foot.	Ma binu ti a ba lọ si ẹsẹ ti ko tọ.
They will find us now.	Wọn yoo wa a ni bayi.
Some from themselves.	Diẹ ninu awọn lati ara wọn.
It is a pretty serious matter.	O ti wa ni a lẹwa pataki ọrọ.
It doesn’t have to be anything special.	Ko ni lati jẹ ohunkohun pataki.
Something called.	Ohun kan pe.
He says he needs some time to think about it.	O sọ pe o nilo akoko diẹ lati ronu lori rẹ.
I did really well.	Mo ṣe daradara gaan.
I can't stop anything.	Nko le da nkankan duro.
The restaurant is a local restaurant.	Ile ounjẹ naa jẹ ounjẹ agbegbe.
It gets better every year.	O ma n dara ni gbogbo ọdun.
This is a very good thing.	Eyi jẹ ohun ti o dara pupọ.
In this there is wisdom and understanding.	Ninu eyi ni ọgbọn ati oye otitọ wa.
The man worked on.	Ọkunrin naa ṣiṣẹ lori.
He had trouble meeting deadlines.	O ni wahala lati pade awọn akoko ipari.
Don't!	Maṣe ṣe!
Well, he was the one who definitely got the money.	O dara, o jẹ ọkan ti o dajudaju gba owo.
How much work would you do?	Elo ni iṣẹ ti iwọ yoo ṣe?
Great, we thought.	Nla, a ro.
It is not in the contract.	Ko si ninu adehun naa.
We cannot return.	A ko le pada.
That has been my whole life.	Iyẹn ni o ti jẹ gbogbo igbesi aye mi.
It’s a lot harder than people think, you know.	O nira pupọ ju awọn eniyan ro lọ, o mọ.
People usually eat only bread.	Eniyan maa n jẹ akara nikan.
He hated himself more than anything.	O korira ara rẹ ju ohunkohun lọ.
A man who never turned to his friends.	Ọkunrin ti ko yipada si awọn ọrẹ rẹ rara.
School is important.	Ile-iwe jẹ pataki.
Like family.	Bi ebi.
No because you have not received.	Ko si nitori ti o ti ko gba.
He saw no reason to raise another person.	Ko ri idi kan lati gbe eniyan miiran dide.
Let me show you this.	Jẹ ki n fi eyi han ọ.
But you can not raise it yourself.	Ṣugbọn o ko le gbe e dide funrararẹ.
I am happy to work for this company.	Inu mi dun lati ṣiṣẹ fun ile-iṣẹ yii.

We should change our ways before it is too late.	A yẹ ki o yi awọn ọna wa pada ṣaaju ki o to pẹ.

Tom is a great boy.	Tom jẹ ọmọkunrin nla kan.
No music.	Ko si orin.
When finished, the room is on the way.	Nigbati o ba pari, yara naa wa ni ọna naa.
It has been such a great one, it worked so hard for me.	O ti jẹ ọkan nla bẹ, o ṣiṣẹ pupọ fun mi.

Just so, so.	O kan bẹ, bẹ.
It has never happened to me that it will happen again.	Ko tii ṣẹlẹ si mi pe yoo tun ṣe.
Okay, this is the last box.	O dara, eyi ni apoti ti o kẹhin.
You can even feel it.	O le paapaa lero rẹ.
It has come with time only.	O ti wa pẹlu akoko nikan.
We have to look at that first and foremost.	A ni lati wo iyẹn ni akọkọ ati ṣaaju.
I need to get home.	Mo nilo lati de ile.
I am no longer a man.	Emi kii ṣe ọkunrin mọ.
They arrested me.	Won mu mi.
The pictures tell, they tell stories.	Awọn aworan sọ, wọn sọ awọn itan.
In any special way.	Ni eyikeyi ọna pataki.
You should look at the things you drink.	O yẹ ki o wo awọn nkan ti o mu.
That's enough.	O ti ni to.
You must have gone into the office as soon as you pulled away.	O gbọdọ ti lọ sinu ọfiisi ni kete ti o fa kuro.
I have to have some.	Mo ni lati ni diẹ ninu awọn.
Nothing of that kind has been seen before.	Ko si ohun ti iru ti a ti ri tẹlẹ.
It was beautiful and warm there, they said.	O lẹwa ati ki o gbona nibẹ, wọn sọ.
Apparently he had been arrested for some reason.	O han gbangba pe o ti da ọ si fun idi kan.
These decisions have not been made in the last two months.	Awọn ipinnu wọnyi ko ṣe ni awọn oṣu meji to kọja.
This, of course, is not true.	Eyi, dajudaju, kii ṣe otitọ.
But he will come back.	Ṣugbọn oun yoo pada wa.
He does not know what he is doing.	Ko mọ ohun ti o n ṣe.
As you can see, in fact you don’t have any.	Bi o ṣe le ṣe akiyesi, ni otitọ o ko ni eyikeyi.
You are here first.	O wa nibi akọkọ.
But he can see you.	Ṣugbọn o le ri ọ.

Come up to my room.	Wa soke si yara mi.
Here, more clearly, in our eyes.	Nibi, o han gbangba diẹ sii, ni oju wa.
There is a price for something.	Iye owo wa fun nkan kan.
Just stick with an idea.	O kan duro pẹlu ero kan.
I asked them.	Mo beere lọwọ wọn.
He decided to keep his thoughts to himself for the morning.	O pinnu lati pa awọn ero rẹ fun owurọ.
He will have to renovate the place well when the time comes.	Oun yoo ni lati tun ibi naa ṣe daradara nigbati akoko ba wa.
It's too late.	O ti pẹ.
Please see.	Jọwọ wo.
It is impossible to believe that this is happening.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati gbagbọ pe eyi n ṣẹlẹ.
I did not recognize the man.	Emi ko da ọkunrin naa mọ.
Meet your wife.	Pade iyawo rẹ.
Clear the area.	Ko agbegbe naa kuro.
And it needs to happen soon.	Ati pe o nilo lati ṣẹlẹ laipẹ.
We lost time about a month.	A ti padanu akoko nipa oṣu kan.
Lots of men.	Awọn ọkunrin pupọ.
He raised his hand.	O gbe ọwọ rẹ soke.
At least the station is still open.	O kere ju ibudo naa ṣi ṣi silẹ.
I am also looking for other ways to do it.	Mo tun wa awọn ọna miiran lati ṣe.
You have to.	O ni lati.
I have seen this.	Mo ti ri eyi.
You have them.	O ni wọn.
Just wait, wait, wait.	Kan duro, duro, duro.

I need to have time to eat lunch.	Mo nilo lati ni akoko lati jẹ ounjẹ ọsan.
They are in a state of incredible promise.	Wọn wa ni ipo ti ileri iyalẹnu.
We saw nothing, we thought nothing.	A ko ri nkankan, ko ro nkankan.

I don’t think you are in this situation.	Emi ko ro pe o wa ni ipo yii.
I love it for it.	Mo nifẹ rẹ fun rẹ.
Wear warm clothes.	Wọ aṣọ ti o gbona.

He left her.	O fi i silẹ.
We have to forget about this game.	A ni lati gbagbe nipa ere yii.
However, here we are again.	Sibẹsibẹ, nibi a tun wa.
We lost our home as well.	A padanu ile wa pẹlu.
I want to take a break.	Mo fe gba isinmi.
At least not for us.	O kere ju ko ṣee ṣe fun wa.
We have this.	A ni eyi.
As it happens, there are fires in the area.	Bi o ṣe ṣẹlẹ, awọn ina wa ni agbegbe naa.
It usually starts that way.	O maa n bẹrẹ ni ọna yẹn.
I can't leave here.	Nko le kuro nibi.
We look at the world.	A wo aye.
He doesn’t seem to enjoy it.	Ko dabi pe ko gbadun rẹ.
You need to leave and never go back.	O nilo lati lọ kuro ki o ma ṣe pada.
In some cases.	Ni awọn igba miiran.
I will never do that again.	Emi kii yoo tun ṣe bẹ lẹẹkansi.
O le gaan.	O le gaan.
We had a few hours before dinner, he said.	A ni awọn wakati diẹ ṣaaju ounjẹ alẹ, o si sọ.
This can be repeated.	Eyi le tun ṣe.
Not for myself, not for anyone else.	Kii ṣe fun ara mi, kii ṣe si ẹnikẹni miiran.
But it's really a matter of hands.	Sugbon o ni gan ọrọ kan ti ọwọ.
Small things have a real value.	Awọn nkan kekere ni iye gaan.
No other car appears.	Ko si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ miiran ti o han.
No one worked.	Ko si ọkan ti o ṣiṣẹ.
This is no small task.	Eyi kii ṣe iṣẹ kekere.
So he returned to live with his mother.	Nitorina o pada lati gbe pẹlu iya rẹ.
You can still get that understanding.	O tun le gba oye yẹn.
We can not wait for that to happen.	A ko le duro de iyẹn lati ṣẹlẹ.
It changes with new questions.	O yipada pẹlu awọn ibeere tuntun.
That is not just about life.	Iyẹn kii ṣe nipa aye nikan.
That work began today.	Iṣẹ yẹn bẹrẹ loni.
Beyond incomprehensible words.	Kọja awọn ọrọ ti ko ni oye.
Everyone will miss her so much.	Gbogbo eniyan ni yoo padanu rẹ pupọ.
He has big hands.	O ni awọn ọwọ nla.
I did not say anything.	Nko so nkankan.
The journey begins to make plans.	Irin-ajo naa bẹrẹ lati ṣe awọn eto.
My father taught it.	Baba mi kọ ọ.
The children went into the water.	Awọn ọmọ naa lọ sinu omi.
I think time has stopped.	Mo ro pe akoko ti duro.
One day, you will understand.	Ni ọjọ kan, iwọ yoo loye.
Of course it’s not just about that.	Dajudaju kii ṣe nipa iyẹn nikan.
And, have heard of it.	Ati, ti gbọ nipa rẹ.
They happened to him.	Wọn ṣẹlẹ si i.
But soon he found himself without celebration at all.	Ṣugbọn laipẹ o ri ara rẹ laisi ayẹyẹ rara.
He will not be a problem anymore.	Oun kii yoo jẹ iṣoro mọ.
I can't miss you either.	Emi ko le padanu iwọ paapaa.
He asked for the money back.	O beere owo naa pada.
We are happy to have you play football for us.	Inu wa dun lati ni ki o kọ bọọlu fun wa.
I may have died from this, but it was not my time.	Mo ti le ti ku lati yi, sugbon o je ko mi akoko.
I think this might help.	Mo ro pe eyi le ṣe iranlọwọ.
He has done so much for them tonight.	O ti ṣe pupọ fun wọn ni alẹ oni.
Look at me, mother.	Wo mi, iya.
I will not soon.	Emi ko ni kete.
At any time now the first group can come.	Ni eyikeyi akoko bayi ẹgbẹ akọkọ le wa.
He decided to act on what he heard.	O pinnu lati ṣiṣẹ lori ohun ti o gbọ.
She is worried about meeting new friends.	O jẹ aniyan nipa ipade awọn ọrẹ tuntun.
The simplest thing is to just ask.	Ohun ti o rọrun julọ ni lati beere nikan.
But do not expect me to understand.	Ṣugbọn maṣe reti mi lati loye.
Most people live in this area.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan n gbe ni agbegbe yii.
They may have more to do with each other.	Wọn le ni diẹ lati ṣe pẹlu ara wọn.
When she saw her men, she tried to pull herself up.	Nigbati o ri awọn ọkunrin rẹ, o gbiyanju lati fa ara rẹ soke.
They say so.	Wọn sọ bẹẹ.
Whatever you want to be here.	Ohunkohun ti o fẹ lati wa ni nibi.
You have no idea what you just did.	O ko ni imọran ohun ti o kan ṣe.
Just a minute.	O kan iṣẹju kan.
That's it.	Iyẹn niyẹn.
he wondered.	o ṣe iyalẹnu.
I am happy about that.	Inu mi dun nipa iyẹn.
Stand.	Duro.
But there again, nothing is given.	Ṣugbọn nibẹ lẹẹkansi, ohunkohun ti wa ni fun.
The body is constantly changing.	Ara n yipada nigbagbogbo.
And as a married man, he knew that children were on the way.	Ati bi ọkunrin kan ti o ni iyawo, o mọ pe awọn ọmọde wa ni ọna.
It is a matter of life, and it does not mean man.	O jẹ ọrọ aye, ati pe ko tumọ si eniyan.
I should just let it be your way.	Mo ti yẹ ki o kan jẹ ki o ni ọna rẹ.
There are many applications for both types.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun elo wa fun awọn iru mejeeji.
I have heard of men like you.	Mo ti gbọ ti awọn ọkunrin bi iwọ.
He didn't seem to laugh for a long time.	O dabi ẹni pe ko rẹrin ni igba pipẹ.
I know you have done some of that.	Mo mọ pe o ti ṣe diẹ ninu iyẹn.
The car stopped in the morning.	Ọkọ naa duro ni owurọ.
Contact me.	Kan kan si mi.
I can find something else to do.	Mo le wa nkan miiran lati ṣe.
At least, that’s my explanation.	O kere ju, iyẹn ni alaye mi fun.
They want to go.	Wọn fẹ lati lọ.
She is doing well.	O n ṣe daradara.
I just want to go.	Mo kan fẹ lati lọ.
Spend too long with it.	Lo gun ju pẹlu rẹ.
I have to go.	Mo ni lati lọ.
They will be here.	Wọn yoo wa nibi.
I know more about the rules than any of the boys.	Mo mọ diẹ sii nipa awọn ofin ju eyikeyi ninu awọn ọmọkunrin lọ.
Can't wait anymore.	Ko le duro mọ.
That hurt him.	Iyẹn ṣe ipalara fun u.
They both called.	Awon mejeeji pe.
I do not use it myself.	Emi ko lo o funrararẹ.
But it must be important.	Ṣugbọn o gbọdọ ṣe pataki.
People have their own time.	Awọn eniyan ni akoko ti ara wọn.
I am not used to doing this.	Emi ko lo lati ṣe eyi.
It will not start.	Kii yoo bẹrẹ.
Your place is with us.	Ibi rẹ wa pẹlu wa.
I love being with my friends.	Mo nifẹ lati wa pẹlu awọn ọrẹ mi.
I ran there.	Mo sare wa nibẹ.
It must be done before the others do.	O gbọdọ ṣe ṣaaju ki awọn miiran to ṣe.
What to do.	Kini ohun ti o gbọdọ ṣe.
However, environmental problems can arise.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn iṣoro ayika le dide.
Never used it, ever.	Ko tii lo o, lailai.
Keep your eyes on it.	Pa oju rẹ mọ lori rẹ.
You have to want to be better.	O ni lati fẹ lati dara julọ.
Your speech should read as people speak.	Ọrọ rẹ yẹ ki o ka bi eniyan ṣe n sọrọ.
They are simple enough.	Wọn rọrun to.
We had a lot of time yet until the first game.	A ni akoko pupọ sibẹsibẹ titi di ere akọkọ.
Everything works fine but the work.	Ohun gbogbo ṣiṣẹ daradara ṣugbọn iṣẹ naa.
The same sleep on.	Kanna sun oorun lori.
Don't get me wrong.	Maṣe gba mi ni aṣiṣe.
We do not think that is correct.	A ko ro pe iyẹn tọ.
Or what you'd always think.	Tabi ohun ti o fẹ nigbagbogbo ro.
He is loved by so many.	O si ti wa ni feran nipa ki ọpọlọpọ awọn.
However, this did not happen.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi ko ṣẹlẹ.
But it is personal.	Sugbon o jẹ ti ara ẹni.
I have to get them back.	Mo ni lati gba wọn pada.
We do not want to be like that.	A ko fẹ lati dabi iyẹn.
I think they still have it.	Mo ro pe won si tun ni o.
That is completely wrong.	Iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe patapata.
Never forget.	Maṣe gbagbe rara.
Not yet.	Ko ṣe sibẹsibẹ.
It doesn’t sound anything like me.	Ko dun ohunkohun bi emi.
Is this your car?	Ṣe eyi jẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ?
And a house.	Ati ile kan.
The house looks amazing.	Ile naa dabi iyanu.
I was in three games.	Mo wa ninu awọn ere mẹta.
What the picture stands for, has no idea.	Kini idi ti aworan naa duro, ko ni oye kan.
He has a son and a daughter.	O ni ọmọkunrin kan ati ọmọbirin kan.
I would look forward to hearing from you.	Emi yoo nireti lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
We are welcoming people into this place.	A n gba eniyan sinu ibi yii.
And very few of my life friends have children.	Ati pupọ diẹ ninu awọn ọrẹ igbesi aye mi ni awọn ọmọde.
They have time.	Won ni akoko.
I'll take him back here.	Emi yoo mu u pada si ibi.
We cannot break the rules.	A ko le ya awọn ofin.
But we do not yet know why or what happened.	Ṣugbọn a ko tii mọ idi tabi ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
When you eat, eat.	Nigbati o ba jẹun, jẹun.
Expect that this will take a few days.	Reti pe eyi yoo gba awọn ọjọ diẹ.
But no one has come.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o ti wa.
It was a difficult week.	O ni ọsẹ ti o nira.
Get away.	Lọ kuro.
That is not possible at all.	Iyẹn ko ṣeeṣe rara.
But some are not enough.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu awọn ko to.
No, it did not happen.	Rara, ko ṣẹlẹ.
Winter is my time to play.	Igba otutu ni akoko mi si ere.
Way too late.	Ọna ju pẹ.
It is very easy to make it work.	O rọrun pupọ lati jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
I really, really missed it.	Mo gan, gan padanu rẹ.
Stop feeling this way.	Duro rilara ni ọna yii.
It will come out.	O yoo jade.
A kii sun.	A kii sun.
We will be here next week.	A yoo wa nibi ni ọsẹ miiran.
Ask a friend to travel with you.	Beere lọwọ ọrẹ kan lati rin irin-ajo pẹlu rẹ.
I don't know why this is happening.	Emi ko mọ idi ti eyi fi n ṣẹlẹ.
Many things happen.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan ṣẹlẹ.
Let me try it.	Jẹ ki n gbiyanju rẹ.
He loves his work.	O nifẹ iṣẹ rẹ.
Some still stand.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣi duro.
I just broke one a few days before the trip.	Mo kan fọ ọkan ni ọjọ meji diẹ ṣaaju irin-ajo naa.
I do not know what caused this problem.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o fa iṣoro yii.
He can't force a man, anymore.	Ko le fi agbara mu ọkunrin kan, mọ.
If you have other questions, call their company.	Ti o ba ni awọn ibeere miiran, pe ile-iṣẹ wọn.
We start with the information.	A bẹrẹ pẹlu alaye naa.
That is his name.	Orukọ rẹ niyẹn.
You should know that the two are missing.	O yẹ ki o mọ pe awọn meji ti o padanu.
Get into a car.	Wọ sinu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
I know what they will say.	Mo mọ ohun ti wọn yoo sọ.
And sorry.	Ati ki o ma binu.
In fact, it may seem like it will never end.	Ni otitọ, o le dabi pe kii yoo pari.
We have to do something.	A ni lati se nkankan.
He said he could see from the outside.	O sọ pe o le rii lati ita.
He has three brothers and a sister.	O ni awọn arakunrin ati arabinrin mẹta.
Or maybe not better.	Tabi boya ko dara.
How full they are.	Bawo ni wọn ti kun.
I'm scared.	Mo n bẹru.
He died in the car.	O ku ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
This is important for two reasons.	Eleyi jẹ pataki fun idi meji.
At least this will give you something to work with.	O kere ju eyi yoo fun ọ ni nkankan lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
But it is a lot of fun.	Sugbon o jẹ kan pupo ti fun.
But he is not the same.	Ṣugbọn oun kii ṣe kanna.
Pick up if you have children.	Gbe soke ti o ba ni awọn ọmọde.
You might even love me.	O le paapaa nifẹ mi.
More this time.	Diẹ sii ni akoko yii.
It attracts many of them.	O fa ọpọlọpọ wọn.
And why not.	Ati idi ti ko.
I have changed my mind.	Mo ti yi ọkan mi pada.
Not to make up.	Ko lati ṣe soke.
But it doesn’t matter now.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe pataki ni bayi.
There is a lot to do around here.	Ọpọlọpọ wa lati ṣe ni ayika ibi.
His one year in office is over.	Ọdun kan rẹ ni ọfiisi ti pari.
Not sure it is the best method but it works.	Ko daju pe o jẹ ọna ti o dara julọ ṣugbọn o ṣiṣẹ.
Wisely, we cannot do that.	Ni ọgbọn, a ko le ṣe bẹ.
He hasn’t said it, but he doesn’t need to.	Ko ti sọ ọ, ṣugbọn ko nilo lati.
There is nothing you can do to me.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe si mi.
But we understand that doubt is there.	Ṣugbọn a loye pe ṣiyemeji wa nibẹ.
Your gift has returned.	Ẹbun rẹ ti pada.
He entered a restaurant known for its fine cuisine.	O wọ ile ounjẹ kan ti a mọ fun ounjẹ to dara julọ.
You are looking for a better place.	O n wa aaye dara julọ.
If he kills you, he kills you.	Ti o ba pa ọ, o pa ọ.
You have to be there, man.	O ni lati wa nibẹ, eniyan.
Do you.	Ṣe iwọ.
They will have the best kids on board.	Wọn yoo ni awọn ọmọde ti o dara julọ lori ọkọ.
Drivers pass by a car before entering the city.	Awọn awakọ gba nipasẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan ṣaaju ki wọn to wọ ilu naa.
They have to.	Won ni lati.
These programs.	Awọn eto wọnyi.
The whole area.	Gbogbo agbegbe ni.
It was his last job.	O jẹ iṣẹ ikẹhin rẹ.
At least, not at first.	O kere ju, kii ṣe ni akọkọ.
I haven’t seen them in a few years.	Emi ko wo wọn ni ọdun diẹ.
It just seems like my life has always been like this.	O kan dabi pe igbesi aye mi nigbagbogbo dabi eyi.
Make sure to bring water with you.	Rii daju lati mu omi pẹlu rẹ.
He decided to kill himself.	O pinnu lati pa ara rẹ.
Is it wrong to worry?	Ṣe o jẹ aṣiṣe lati ṣe aniyan bi?
You need not believe me.	O nilo ko gbagbọ mi.
People talk and laugh.	Awọn eniyan sọrọ ati rẹrin.
It should be there.	O yẹ ki o wa nibẹ.
One can see it now.	Eniyan le rii ni bayi.
They believe.	Wọn gbagbọ.
I never wanted to see him.	Emi ko fẹ lati ri i lailai.
We want people to feel good when we do.	A fẹ ki awọn eniyan ni rilara ti o dara nigba ti a ba ṣe.
Or give away.	Tabi fun kuro.
Make time for people.	Ṣe akoko fun eniyan.
It doesn't matter very much.	Ko ṣe pataki pupọ.
We love them so much.	A nifẹ wọn pupọ.
It seems to be there.	O dabi pe o wa.
I came by decision.	Mo wa nipasẹ ipinnu.
There is music in that.	Orin wa ninu iyẹn.
When they enter the house.	Nigbati wọn ba wọ inu ile.
There is no passion.	Ife gidigidi ko si.
At the same time, it was such a great year.	Ni akoko kanna, o jẹ ọdun nla bẹ.
At the very least.	O kere pupọ.
We did a lot more.	A ṣe pupọ diẹ sii.
They didn’t notice me.	Wọn ko ṣe akiyesi mi.
You are not of your own accord.	Iwọ ko ti ara rẹ wa.
We don't have much money.	A ko ni owo pupọ.
You better do the same.	O dara ki o ṣe kanna.
Do not leave yourself with him.	Maṣe fi ara rẹ silẹ pẹlu rẹ.
What gave me an idea.	Ohun ti o fun mi ni ero.
You are here first.	O wa nibi akọkọ.
Songs without music, written out as they are.	Awọn orin laisi orin, ti a kọ jade bi wọn ti jẹ.
He has the power to do great things.	O ni agbara lati ṣe awọn ohun nla.
Some of us expect the police to take it seriously as well.	Diẹ ninu wa nireti pe ọlọpa lati mu ni pataki pẹlu.
We will never have an accident again.	A ko ni ni ijamba mọ.
He is out of town.	O ti jade ni ilu.
That he wants does not matter.	Wipe o fe ko ṣe pataki.
I don’t think you even want help.	Emi ko ro pe o paapaa fẹ iranlọwọ.
That means we are stuck. 	Iyẹn tumọ si pe a ti di. 
The book contains hot water.	Iwe naa ni omi gbona.
We will have to cut, cut, cut.	A yoo ni lati ge, ge, ge.
One day everything will be fine.	Ni ọjọ kan ohun gbogbo yoo dara gaan.
Only add them.	Fi wọn kun nikan.
Which you know of your life, make sense.	Eyi ti o mọ ti igbesi aye rẹ, ṣe oye.
The smaller these people know the better.	Awọn kere wọnyi eniyan mọ awọn dara.
After a few minutes, he tried again.	Lẹhin iṣẹju diẹ, o tun gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
It is easy to hit the baby.	O rọrun lati lu ọmọ.
I have been in trouble with this for a few days.	Mo ti wa ninu wahala pẹlu eyi fun awọn ọjọ diẹ.
I was happy with how it turned out.	Inu mi dun pẹlu bi o ṣe jade.
I wondered how it would hurt.	Mo ṣe iyalẹnu bawo ni yoo ṣe ṣe ipalara.
But only a little.	Sugbon nikan kekere kan.
It was my first job.	O jẹ iṣẹ akọkọ mi.
There is no place to hide.	Ko si ibi lati tọju.
We have to fetch water from the river.	A ni lati gbe omi lati odo.
Word is around.	Ọrọ ti wa ni ayika.
Before you believe.	Ṣaaju ki o to gbagbọ.
I am the only one.	Emi nikan ni.
There is also a table football.	Bọọlu tabili kan tun wa.
Can't wait.	Ko le duro.
He decided it was	O pinnu wipe o je
It's so simple.	O rọrun bẹ.
He has never seen anything like it.	Ko tii ri ohunkohun ti o dabi rẹ rara.
Pretty good, but that comes from within.	Lẹwa dara, ṣugbọn iyẹn wa lati inu.
Okay, that didn't happen.	O dara, iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ.
It was a great thing to see.	O jẹ ohun nla lati rii.
It can be sent back to complete the task.	A le fi ranṣẹ pada lati pari iṣẹ naa.
It doesn't matter.	Ko ṣe pataki.
Not even back.	Ko da a pada.
That is personal to me.	Ti ara ẹni niyẹn si mi.
Now the group no longer works.	Bayi ẹgbẹ ko ṣiṣẹ mọ.
I also hate it.	Mo tun korira.
I took it to my bed for the whole day.	Mo mu si ibusun mi fun gbogbo ọjọ naa.
That did.	Iyẹn ṣe e.
And you are.	Ati pe iwọ ni.
I do not really like it.	Emi ko fẹran rẹ gaan.
They are all there, your families.	Gbogbo wọn wa nibẹ, awọn idile rẹ.
There was some trouble.	Nibẹ wà diẹ ninu awọn wahala.
The child has to go.	Ọmọde naa ni lati lọ.
Maybe it will take me somehow.	Boya yoo mu mi lọ si ọna kan.
The road leading to the city is the least crossing.	Opopona ti o lọ si ilu naa jẹ o kere ju kọja.
Our job is to do all this work.	Iṣẹ wa ni lati ṣe gbogbo iṣẹ yii.
I need some time to look at this.	Mo nilo akoko diẹ lati wo eyi.
This did not make me feel really good.	Eyi ko jẹ ki ara mi dara gaan.
So do some other.	Nitorina ṣe diẹ ninu awọn miiran.
They love each other very much.	Wọn nifẹ ara wọn pupọ.
We just have to catch up.	A o kan ni lati yẹ.
Everyone is making money.	Gbogbo eniyan n ṣe owo.
They just try to change.	Wọn kan gbiyanju lati yi pada.
Here she lives with a husband and two children.	Nibi o ngbe pẹlu ọkọ kan ati awọn ọmọ meji.
The vehicles were special.	Awọn ọkọ je pataki.
So he went.	Nitorina o lọ.
I try to be a good company.	Mo gbiyanju lati jẹ ile-iṣẹ ti o dara.
They have decided to come together.	Wọn ti pinnu lati wa papọ.
The facts speak for themselves.	Awọn otitọ sọ fun ara wọn.
Better one by one.	O dara julọ ọkan si ọkan.
No one left the boat.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o fi ọkọ naa silẹ.
I hope you had an accident, he thought.	Mo nireti pe o ni ijamba, o ro.
I am so good.	Mo ki o dara julọ.
We have a place and so on, now we need it when.	A ni ibiti ati bii, ni bayi a nilo nigbawo.
Good place.	O dara ni ibi.
But he continued to give up.	Ṣugbọn o tẹsiwaju lati fi silẹ.
How are you?	Bawo ni o se wa.
Sometimes it is important to get things out before you have everything.	Nigba miiran o ṣe pataki lati gba awọn nkan jade ṣaaju ki o to ni ohun gbogbo.
Nothing to do.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣee ṣe.
Not for a year or two.	Ko fun odun kan tabi meji.
We need your help to take care of it.	A ni lati ni iranlọwọ rẹ lati tọju rẹ.
See here.	Wo nibi.
All its major cities are on the beach.	Gbogbo awọn ilu pataki rẹ wa ni eti okun.
He left the lights on.	O fi awọn ina silẹ.
Talk to them about that.	Sọ pẹlu wọn nipa iyẹn.
You see them everywhere.	O ri wọn nibi gbogbo.
Eat them.	Jẹ wọn.
Please do not look at them.	Jọwọ maṣe wo wọn.
About the future.	Nipa ojo iwaju.
You know that face.	O mọ oju yẹn.
You only need to get it.	O nilo lati gba nikan.
Nothing will suit me.	Ko si ohun ti yoo ba mi dara.
They are under great fire.	Wọn wa labẹ ina nla.
I hope you can be with us alive.	Mo nireti pe o le wa pẹlu wa laaye.
Your money has taken your money.	Owo rẹ ti gba owo rẹ.
But it was time for him to leave.	Ṣugbọn o to akoko fun u lati lọ.
It's full of fire.	O kun fun ina.
It will not work with this truck.	Kii yoo ṣiṣẹ pẹlu ọkọ nla yii.
I want to be alone.	Mo fe lati wa ni nikan.
No one is there.	Ko si ẹnikan nibẹ.
I hope it works.	Mo nireti pe o ṣiṣẹ.
I don't have this problem anymore.	Emi ko ni iṣoro yii mọ.
I want to change my hair.	Mo fe yi irun ori mi pada.
And it is not always enough that we can expect it.	Ati pe kii ṣe nigbagbogbo to pe a le nireti rẹ.
Only a few of us.	Diẹ ninu wa nikan ni.
I can feel it.	Mo le lero lori rẹ.
He will do anything to reach it.	Oun yoo ṣe ohunkohun lati de ọdọ rẹ.
Not that he would lose.	Kii ṣe pe oun yoo padanu.
He stuck out through the winter.	O si di jade nipasẹ awọn igba otutu.
Much better there.	Elo dara si nibẹ.
But that will not happen.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
What a big tree!	Iru igi nla ni!
I know it makes sense to me.	Mo mọ pe o ṣe oye fun mi.
He did not know our mother at all.	Oun ko mọ iya wa rara.
Here are some ideas to consider.	Eyi ni diẹ ninu awọn ero lati ronu.
The sun was out for several hours.	Oorun ti jade fun awọn wakati pupọ.
One of the most important at the moment.	Ọkan ninu awọn julọ pataki ni akoko.
Thirty people were killed.	Eniyan igba o le ọgbọn ni wọn pa.
There are such families.	Iru awon idile wa.
Many ancient cities were submerged in water.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ilu atijọ ni a kọ sinu omi.
If we had more, it would be great.	Ti a ba ni diẹ sii, yoo jẹ nla.
And that’s good, though.	Ati pe iyẹn dara, paapaa.
Another year living at home.	Odun miiran ngbe ni ile.
Please, take my mailbox.	Jọwọ, gba apoti ile-iṣẹ mi.
We are on our way.	A wa lori ọna wa.
I asked him if he had children.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ boya o ni awọn ọmọde.
The youth group tried to remove the tree.	Ẹgbẹ ọdọ gbiyanju lati yọ igi naa kuro.
Things don’t work that way, however.	Awọn nkan ko ṣiṣẹ ni ọna yẹn, sibẹsibẹ.
He can not put the child in.	Ko le fi ọmọ sinu.
Explain in simple terms what this means.	Ṣe alaye ni awọn ọrọ ti o rọrun kini eyi tumọ si.
That's how you build a game.	Iyẹn ni o ṣe kọ ere kan.
How many times have you visited this restaurant?	Igba melo ni o ṣabẹwo si ile ounjẹ yii?
I know better than to find trouble.	Mo mọ dara ju lati wa wahala.
It feels good.	O n rilara ti o dara.
Maybe you don't understand.	Boya o ko ni loye.
You do not understand what they mean.	O ko loye ohun ti wọn tumọ si.
They paid a lot of money for the house.	Wọn san owo nla fun ile naa.
It has become my place too.	O ti di aaye mi paapaa.
But it is another thing to carry them out.	Sugbon o jẹ ohun miiran lati gbe wọn jade.
But it is very simple.	Ṣugbọn o rọrun pupọ.
Do you need a lift?	Ṣe o nilo a gbe soke?
It took time to figure that out.	O gba akoko lati wa iyẹn jade.
But this will not work.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
You must do the work for me.	O gbọdọ ṣe iṣẹ naa fun mi.
When he looked again, he was still there.	Nigbati o tun wo, o tun wa nibẹ.
I have something great to do today.	Mo ni nkan nla lati ṣe loni.
Do not.	Ṣe ko si.
Your system takes account of local conditions.	Eto rẹ gba iroyin ti awọn ipo agbegbe.
I will meet you back at the restaurant.	Emi yoo pade yin pada si ile ounjẹ.
I also want to know.	Mo tun fẹ lati mọ.
Travel can also be done.	Irin-ajo le tun ṣe.
Her parents had no questions.	Awọn obi rẹ ko ni ibeere.
Our houses.	Awọn ile wa.
The mother of these children went on vacation.	Iya ti awọn ọmọ wọnyi lọ si isinmi.
Early to close the office.	Ni kutukutu lati pa ọfiisi naa.
Everything you could want.	Ohun gbogbo ti o le fẹ.
No injuries.	Ko si awọn ipalara.
Do not take money from someone you do not know.	Maṣe gba owo lọwọ eniyan ti o ko mọ.
Turn around and take me home.	Yipada ki o si mu mi lọ si ile.
Of course it is obvious.	Dajudaju o han gbangba.
It means well.	O tumọ si daradara.
He made some suggestions.	O ṣe diẹ ninu awọn imọran.
This is from me.	Eyi wa lati ọdọ mi.
Anything to talk about with it.	Ohunkohun lati sọrọ nipa pẹlu rẹ.
It just felt like a big game.	O kan ro bi ere nla kan.
You may not understand how that might work.	O ko le ni oye bi iyẹn ṣe le ṣiṣẹ.
You hope your phone is fixed.	O nireti pe foonu rẹ ti wa titi.
The meal was cooked over an open fire.	A ti se ounjẹ naa lori ina ti o ṣi silẹ.
It is best not to contact.	O dara julọ lati ma ṣe kan si.
If so, you are right.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, o tọ.
The station has not been retrieved.	Ibudo naa ko tii gba pada.
Lifting my head.	Mimu ori mi soke.
This observation is only a possible explanation.	Yi akiyesi jẹ nikan kan ṣee ṣe alaye.
At least, the two are friends.	O kere ju, awọn mejeeji jẹ ọrẹ.
You missed it so much.	O padanu rẹ pupọ.
You have to spend time.	O ni lati lo akoko.
Sometimes we make love with our hands.	Nigba miiran a ṣe ifẹ pẹlu ọwọ wa.
Tomorrow, the first thing.	Ọla, ohun akọkọ.
He said they could kill both.	O sọ pe wọn le pa awọn mejeeji.
Others think he is a doctor.	Awọn miiran ro pe o jẹ dokita.
They are tired of walking for a long time.	Wọn ti rẹ wọn lati rin fun igba pipẹ.
We hope you feel the same.	A nireti pe o lero kanna.
I am alive.	Mo jẹ igbesi aye.
For everyone on this earth.	Fun gbogbo eniyan lori ile aye yi.
At first, the agreement must have seemed justified.	Ni akọkọ, adehun naa gbọdọ ti dabi ẹni pe o tọ.
They are not right for my book.	Wọn ko tọ fun iwe mi.
These trees are tall.	Awọn igi wọnyi ga.
I will think of things to say and questions to ask.	Emi yoo ronu awọn nkan lati sọ ati awọn ibeere lati beere.
You feel things.	O lero ohun.
I did something for you, and you know what it is.	Mo ti ṣe nkankan fun o, ati awọn ti o mọ ohun ti o jẹ.
I can't believe my ears.	Emi ko le gbagbọ eti mi.
What food does your family eat?	Ounjẹ wo ni idile rẹ jẹ?
We will get lots of pictures, pictures of everyone, people like pictures.	A yoo gba ọpọlọpọ awọn aworan, awọn aworan ti gbogbo eniyan, eniyan fẹ awọn aworan.
Don't even ask!	Maṣe beere paapaa!
They plan to get married soon.	Wọn gbero lati ṣe igbeyawo laipẹ.
He is not a child.	Kii ṣe ọmọ.
Don't pick this up.	Maṣe gbe eyi soke.
They must have such information inside.	Wọn gbọdọ ni iru alaye inu.
I'll put it here.	Emi yoo fi si ibi.
We must hurry back the way we were.	A gbọdọ yara pada ni ọna ti a wa.
Live the time you are in.	Gbe awọn akoko ti o ba wa ni.
It’s something we’ll see.	O jẹ nkan ti a yoo wo.
We do take it, play it back.	A ṣe a Ya, dun o pada.
We have a store.	A ni ile itaja kan.
I can't wait to play.	Emi ko le duro lati mu ṣiṣẹ.
It was hard, so hard.	O je lile, ki lile.
You can start on your own.	O le bẹrẹ lori ara rẹ.
They are learning where everything is.	Wọn n kọ ẹkọ ni ibi ti ohun gbogbo wa.
If you walk down this road, you will find a dog.	Ti o ba rin ni isalẹ ọna yii, iwọ yoo wa aja kan.
We want to be as close to the dog as possible.	A fẹ lati wa nitosi bi o ti ṣee ṣe si aja.
It takes time !.	O gba akoko!.
No education continued over time.	Ko si ẹkọ ti o tẹsiwaju lori akoko.
I do not see it as you.	Emi ko ri i bi o.
Be young forever.	Jẹ ọdọ lailai.
That is the job.	Iyẹn ni iṣẹ naa.
There is no way you can get it.	Ko si ọna ti o le gba.
You have nothing bad to say about anyone.	O ko ni ohun buburu lati sọ nipa ẹnikẹni.
Tomorrow will not be easy to get up.	Ọla kii yoo rọrun lati dide.
I was not born in a big city.	A ko bi mi ni ilu nla kan.
Again this should work to your advantage.	Lẹẹkansi eyi yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ si anfani rẹ.
Three men inside.	Awọn ọkunrin mẹta ni inu.
You always write well.	O nigbagbogbo kọ daradara.
It is, and it is not.	O jẹ, ati pe kii ṣe.
Are these the last ones?	Ṣe awọn wọnyi ni o kẹhin?
The question is too late.	Ibeere naa wa pẹ ju.
There will be, you think, there will be.	Yoo wa, o ro pe, yoo wa.
He made some mistakes.	O ṣe diẹ ninu awọn aṣiṣe.
But they told him to stop.	Ṣugbọn wọn sọ fun u pe ki o duro.
He also learned art.	O tun kọ ẹkọ aworan.
Not on materials.	Kii ṣe lori awọn ohun elo.
There is nothing for him to do here.	Ko si nkankan fun u lati ṣe nibi.
It started last year some time.	O bẹrẹ ni ọdun to kọja diẹ ninu awọn akoko.
I hope you will come to visit me soon.	Mo nireti pe iwọ yoo wa ṣabẹwo si mi laipẹ.
I have two houses.	Mo ni ile meji.
She looked at her father.	O wo baba rẹ.
It is very good to be honest.	O dara pupọ lati jẹ otitọ.
Now tell me.	Bayi so fun mi.
Go ahead, 'he said.	Tẹsiwaju,' o sọ.
It will not be the first time.	Kii yoo jẹ igba akọkọ.
I'm honest.	Mo wa otitọ.
But our eyes met.	Ṣugbọn oju wa pade.
But this point does not matter.	Ṣugbọn aaye yii ko ṣe pataki.
In the same way.	Ni ọna kanna.
That is a good thing to say.	Iyẹn jẹ ohun ti o dara lati sọ.
There is a lot of talk behind me.	Ọrọ pupọ wa lẹhin mi.
Everyone in my family was taken care of.	Gbogbo eniyan ninu idile mi ni a tọju.
More interesting things.	Diẹ awon ohun.
He is a very good dog and friend.	O jẹ aja ti o dara gaan ati ọrẹ.
After that, it worked well.	Lẹhin iyẹn, o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
I am giving the phone back to your father right now.	Mo n fi foonu naa pada fun baba rẹ ni bayi.
He has not seen her since he was born.	Oun ko tii ri i lati igba ti a ti bi i.
Now, come with me.	Bayi, wa pẹlu mi.
I remember how we were.	Mo ranti bi a ti wà.
Those things do not always exist.	Awọn nkan yẹn ko wa nigbagbogbo.
You know me.	O mọ mi.
I have stories like this.	Mo ni awọn itan bi bayi.
He decided to leave.	O pinnu lati lọ kuro.
Not a bad way to start a friendship.	Kii ṣe ọna buburu lati bẹrẹ ọrẹ.
You get a little sister.	O gba arabinrin kekere.
Just look at what you drink.	Kan wo ohun ti o mu.
You will never see him again.	Iwọ kii yoo ri i lẹẹkansi.
Some people, they die.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan, wọn ku.
He has never said such a thing before.	Ko tii sọrọ iru bẹ tẹlẹ.
But he was too young to remember.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ọmọde pupọ lati ranti.
There was nothing for me to go see.	Ko si nkankan fun mi lati lọ ri i.
The first story is another matter.	Itan akọkọ jẹ ọrọ miiran.
It will take months, especially years.	Yoo gba awọn oṣu, paapaa ọdun.
It will be your job.	Yoo jẹ iṣẹ rẹ.
For weeks, even.	Fun awọn ọsẹ, paapaa.
But we missed the opportunity.	Ṣugbọn a padanu anfani naa.
That is the end of the story.	Ipari itan naa niyen.
However they did not stop there.	Sibẹsibẹ wọn ko duro nibẹ.
I have never seen anything like it.	Emi ko rii nkan bii iyẹn rara.
He and I.	Oun ati emi.
Get your lot.	Gba pupọ rẹ.
You certainly should not be here, do this.	O dajudaju ko yẹ ki o wa nibi, ṣe eyi.
I opened.	Mo ṣii.
I just want a better life for him.	Mo kan fẹ igbesi aye to dara julọ fun u.
And they like to stay where they are.	Ati pe wọn fẹran lati duro si ibiti wọn ti mọ.
Very nice to come back.	O dara pupọ lati pada wa.
Now they come into our big time.	Bayi wọn wa sinu wa akoko nla.
No questions about it.	Ko si ibeere nipa rẹ.
Her eyes widened in surprise.	Awọn oju oju rẹ dide ni iyalẹnu.
Your wife is right.	Otitọ ni iyawo rẹ.
So no one went.	Nitorina ko si ẹnikan ti o lọ.
I could not understand what he was trying to say.	Emi ko le ni oye ohun ti o n gbiyanju lati sọ.
He said he would die.	O sọ pe oun yoo ku.
As you do.	Bi o ṣe.
People are like people.	Awọn eniyan dabi eniyan.
They will come back.	Wọn yoo pada wa.
I went out to give it to him.	Mo jade lati fun u.
I tried again and again in the same error.	Mo tun gbiyanju lẹẹkansi ati ni aṣiṣe kanna.
What it has but does not have.	Ohun ti o ni sugbon ko ni.
They need something to eat.	Wọn nilo nkankan lati jẹ.
The trees are taller than them.	Awọn igi ti o ga julọ ga ju wọn lọ.
That is what made me think of his mother.	Ohun to je ki n ro iya re niyen.
He revealed himself to her.	O fi ara rẹ han fun u.
It is very anxious.	O jẹ aniyan pupọ.
It seems simple but it is not.	O dabi pe o rọrun ṣugbọn kii ṣe.
It goes without saying.	Ki ma so pe.
This is, however, all you can tell them.	Eyi jẹ, sibẹsibẹ, gbogbo ohun ti o le sọ fun wọn.
That is an amazing news.	Iyẹn jẹ iroyin iyanu.
But he thought they shouldn’t.	Ṣugbọn o ro pe wọn ko yẹ.
One day, he came to me.	Ni ọjọ kan, o wa si ọdọ mi.
Most people are now.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan wa ni bayi.
It gives you the space you need.	O fun ọ ni aaye ti o nilo.
You always do.	O nigbagbogbo ṣe.
I know their children, some of them.	Mo mọ awọn ọmọ wọn, diẹ ninu wọn.
We became good friends.	A di ọrẹ to dara.
It was my first time trying such.	O jẹ igba akọkọ mi lati gbiyanju iru.
You have decided it all for yourself.	O ti pinnu gbogbo rẹ fun ara rẹ.
Our world is full of wonders.	Aye wa kun fun awọn iyanu.
I suspect your story is very true.	Mo fura pe itan rẹ jẹ otitọ pupọ.
I live a good life.	Mo ṣe igbesi aye to dara.
My parents are very well.	Awọn obi mi wa daradara pupọ.
Not too low, not too high.	Ko kere ju, ko ga ju.
It cannot continue like this.	Ko le tẹsiwaju bi eleyi.
It may be more than what it seems.	O le jẹ diẹ sii ju ohun ti o dabi.
Good advice.	O dara imọran.
Nothing can tear us apart.	Ko si ohun ti o le fa wa ya.
I never met the group.	Emi ko pade ẹgbẹ naa rara.
That's what you want most.	Ohun ti o fẹ julọ niyẹn.
Find a vehicle.	Wa ọkọ.
I have never been to one before.	Emi ko tii lọ si ọkan tẹlẹ.
I have friends with money.	Mo ni awọn ọrẹ pẹlu owo.
It was not helped by the music that helped me.	Ko ṣe iranlọwọ nipasẹ orin ti o ran mi.
It has been good for me.	O ti dara fun mi.
That was decided by new information.	Iyẹn pinnu nipasẹ alaye tuntun.
She has nice clothes.	O ni awọn aṣọ to dara.
There are many other reasons as well.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn idi miiran tun wa.
I can't make a house for lunch.	Emi ko le ṣe ile fun ounjẹ ọsan.
So let’s sit in the morning.	Nitorina jẹ ki a joko ni owurọ.
It makes no ,.	O mu ki ko si,.
But of these there are very few in the world.	Sugbon ti awọn wọnyi ni o wa gidigidi diẹ ninu awọn aye.
Which you see.	Eyi ti o ri.
A lot of people have hard ways.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan ni awọn ọna lile.
You feel like that person.	O lero bi ẹni yẹn.
Now it will grow up.	Bayi o yoo dagba soke.
He rose.	O dide.
That was not so much their interest.	Ti o je ko bẹ Elo wọn anfani.
You don't have to go to school.	O ko ni lati lọ si ile-iwe.
You have been asked to go.	O ti beere pe ki o lọ.
I thought it.	Mo ti ro o.
I like art.	Mo feran aworan.
He has given a word to people.	O ti fi ọrọ kan si awọn eniyan.
He comes from another world.	O wa lati aye miiran.
I can find that myself.	Mo le wa iyẹn funrararẹ.
Wrong.	Ko tọ.
Plans have been in the works for months.	Awọn eto ti wa ninu iṣẹ fun awọn oṣu.
Many children are kept out of school.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde ni a pa kuro ni ile-iwe.
I can’t let that happen again.	Emi ko le jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
We have enough money trouble as it is.	A ni wahala owo to bi o ti jẹ.
It was a game that both played.	O je ere kan ti o meji dun.
And remember, you are no longer a little girl.	Ati ranti, iwọ kii ṣe ọmọbirin kekere mọ.
There is a good reason for it.	Nibẹ ni kan ti o dara idi fun o.
Now your job.	Bayi iṣẹ rẹ.
Try it before you go bad.	Gbiyanju rẹ ṣaaju ki o to lọ buburu.
Mo le jade.	Mo le jade.
They get it without conditions.	Wọn gba rẹ laisi awọn ipo.
Go ahead, try it.	Tẹsiwaju, gbiyanju rẹ.
Most students are not.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ko si.
I do not know how it happened.	Emi ko mọ bi o ti ṣẹlẹ.
You believe what you want to believe.	O gbagbọ ohun ti o fẹ gbagbọ.
The same goes for other companies.	Kanna n lọ fun awọn ile-iṣẹ miiran.
Some of her daughters.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọbirin ti rẹ.
It just has to be.	O kan ni lati jẹ.
Good to find your name.	O dara lati wa orukọ rẹ.
I do not know what to say to you.	Emi ko mọ kini lati sọ fun ọ.
But his mother paid attention to that thought.	Ṣugbọn iya rẹ fi san si wipe ero.
I am a very good person.	Emi ni eniyan ti o dara julọ.
I think very much everything can be used.	Mo ro pe pupọ julọ ohun gbogbo le ṣee lo.
So if you are in the area, keep your eyes peeled.	Nitorina ti o ba wa ni agbegbe, pa oju rẹ mọ.
It is not easy to write that.	Ko rọrun rara lati kọ iyẹn.
Not giving away much of the story early.	Ko fun kuro pupọ ti itan ni kutukutu.
All at the same time.	Gbogbo ni akoko kanna.
You have a plan.	O ni eto.
That is not true.	Iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
It also took more than two weeks to go.	O tun ju ọsẹ meji lọ lati lọ.
And that will not happen.	Ati pe iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
It is possible that people used.	O ṣee ṣe pe awọn eniyan lo.
Do not bathe children at this age.	Maṣe wẹ awọn ọmọ ni ọjọ ori yii.
I have always wanted to go.	Mo ti nigbagbogbo fe lati lọ.
We know better.	A mọ dara julọ.
Love is to receive.	Ife ni lati gba.
There is no place to live if life is not worth living.	Ko si aaye lati ni igbesi aye ti ko ba tọ laaye.
He did not want to go without it.	Ko fẹ lati lọ laisi rẹ.
And to love and be loved.	Ati lati nifẹ ati ki o nifẹ.
But they will see.	Ṣugbọn wọn yoo rii.
I have a house.	Mo ni ile kan.
He continued to worry about that for a while.	O tẹsiwaju lati ṣe aniyan nipa iyẹn fun igba diẹ.
When things do not go as planned it is when the best thing happens.	Nigbati awọn nkan ko lọ bi a ti pinnu ni nigbati nkan ti o dara julọ ba ṣẹlẹ.
It's just hard for me.	O kan lile fun mi.
I know it will come.	Mo mọ pe yoo wa.
His men passed this way at night.	Awọn ọkunrin rẹ kọja ni ọna yii ni alẹ.
When an accident happens lives will change sometimes forever.	Nigbati ijamba ba ṣẹlẹ awọn igbesi aye yoo yipada nigba miiran lailai.
I love it, always have and always will.	Mo nifẹ rẹ, nigbagbogbo ni ati nigbagbogbo yoo.
That would be nice.	Iyẹn yoo dara.
We want to help the homeless.	A fẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun awọn ti ko ni ile.
It lets them try again and again and again.	O jẹ ki wọn gbiyanju lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
You can't believe he didn't recognize her.	O ko le gbagbọ pe ko da a mọ.
We are getting married.	A n ṣe igbeyawo.
I do not want to see anyone hurt.	Emi ko fẹ lati ri ẹnikẹni ti o ni ipalara.
They can do whatever they want.	Wọn le ṣe ohunkohun ti wọn fẹ.
But that is the whole story.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ gbogbo itan miiran.
I had to quit my job.	Mo ni lati fi iṣẹ mi silẹ.
I just left the phone with them.	Mo kan kuro ni foonu pẹlu wọn.
It is almost impossible to find them.	O fẹrẹ jẹ pe ko ṣee ṣe lati rii wọn.
So it was great.	Nitorina o jẹ nla.
He was on the same plane.	O si wà lori kanna ofurufu.
Get enough sleep.	Gba oorun ti o to.
This is obviously the way.	Eyi ni o han ni ọna.
But they are probably there too.	Ṣugbọn o ṣee ṣe pe wọn wa nibẹ paapaa.
Look around, see what you notice.	Wo ni ayika, wo ohun ti o ṣe akiyesi.
Not over.	Ko si lori.
I can not.	Nko le ka.
But it is a good one.	Sugbon o jẹ kan ti o dara.
Or the past.	Tabi awọn ti o ti kọja.
We have been driving since this morning.	A ti n wakọ lati owurọ yii.
It is a mistake.	O jẹ aṣiṣe.
In our test none of that.	Ninu idanwo wa ko si ọkan ninu iyẹn.
All of these problems exist.	Gbogbo awọn iṣoro wọnyi wa.
Things change all the time.	Awọn nkan n yipada ni gbogbo igba.
Not good, either.	Ko dara, boya.
It did not work for two years.	Ko ṣiṣẹ fun ọdun meji.
The company brother did not.	Arakunrin ile-iṣẹ ko ṣe.
I remember someone before saying that people should do something else.	Mo ranti ẹnikan ki o to sọ pe eniyan yẹ ki o ṣe nkan miiran.
They’re wrong, you know.	Wọn ko tọ si, o mọ.
Lots of great restaurants do.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile ounjẹ pupọ ṣe.
I should carry them.	Mo yẹ ki o gbe wọn.
That means, of course, they are looking for cars.	Eyi tumọ si, dajudaju, wọn wa awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
This is why this will not last long.	Eyi ni idi ti eyi kii yoo pẹ.
But this is also good.	Ṣugbọn eyi tun dara.
And you have to drive it to school every day.	Ati pe o ni lati wakọ rẹ lọ si ile-iwe ni gbogbo ọjọ.
He looks at the clock.	O n wo aago ni aago.
I do not like it.	Nko feran re.
I would dig around more.	Emi yoo ma wà ni ayika diẹ sii.
It will take too long.	Yoo gba to gun ju.
It will take a long time.	Yoo gba to gun pupọ.
He decided to go for a walk.	O pinnu lati lọ rin.
They can tell you.	Wọn le sọ fun ọ.
They just want you to do well.	Wọn kan fẹ ki o ṣe daradara.
That's it.	O n niyen.
I have not left anything in the love book before.	Emi ko ti fi ohunkohun silẹ ninu iwe ifẹ tẹlẹ.
Less than zero.	Kere ju odo.
Let's play a game.	Jẹ ki a ṣe ere kan.
We will see through it.	A yoo rii nipasẹ rẹ.
Their value goes down.	Iye wọn lọ si isalẹ.
The children refused.	Awọn ọmọ kọ.
He opened the doors.	O ṣi awọn ilẹkun.
We can leave.	A le lọ kuro.
Your job is to make them think about it.	Iṣẹ rẹ ni lati jẹ ki wọn ronu nipa rẹ.
Switch to it.	Yipada si i.
There is no way to go.	Ko ọna lati lọ.
Going means you are dead.	Ti lọ tumọ si pe o ti ku.
I want you to enjoy the moment.	Mo fẹ ki o gbadun akoko naa.
Maybe just about how it goes.	Boya o kan nipa bi o ṣe n tẹsiwaju.
I asked her when she was born.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ nigbati o bi.
I should go now.	Mo yẹ ki o lọ ni bayi.
I hope to have your pictures soon.	Mo nireti lati ni awọn aworan rẹ laipẹ.
Yours or yours, it doesn’t matter.	Tirẹ tabi tirẹ, ko ṣe pataki.
I wish we had time.	Mo fẹ a ni akoko.
The material looks brand new.	Awọn ohun elo naa dabi tuntun.
People continue to flock from all over the area.	Awọn eniyan tẹsiwaju lati wọ lati gbogbo agbegbe naa.
The future of this company is uncertain.	Ọjọ iwaju ti ile-iṣẹ yii ko ni idaniloju.
Will be another used.	Yoo jẹ miiran ti a lo.
I hope not too.	Mo nireti ko paapaa.
They expect me back.	Wọn reti mi pada.
I just took a lot of pictures.	Mo kan ya ọpọlọpọ awọn aworan.
But if you must go, you must.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba gbọdọ lọ, o gbọdọ.
The whole day will be amazing.	Gbogbo ọjọ naa yoo jẹ iyalẹnu.
Do not drink too much!	Maṣe mu pupọ!
It has been one.	O ti jẹ ọkan.
Maybe that will happen this year.	Boya iyẹn yoo ṣẹlẹ ni ọdun yii.
I will write.	Emi yoo kọ.
It is important.	O jẹ pataki.
We are still.	A wà ṣi.
'you hit me'.	'o lu mi'.
We want to start early in the day.	A fẹ lati bẹrẹ ni kutukutu ni ọjọ naa.
As on purpose.	Bi lori idi.
He is himself again.	Oun ni ara rẹ lẹẹkansi.
But, we do.	Ṣugbọn, a ṣe.
I think they know what’s going on.	Mo ro pe wọn mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
It can be done.	O le ṣee ṣe.
However, this is not a good idea.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi kii ṣe imọran to dara.
You will not change.	Iwọ kii yoo yipada.
He knew he should not worry.	O mọ pe ko yẹ ki o ṣe aniyan.
You have to tell.	O ni lati sọ fun.
He thought they were right.	O ro pe wọn jẹ otitọ.
They are looking at me.	Won n wo mi.
At first, she was a woman.	Ni akọkọ, o jẹ ohun obinrin kan.
This is out of your hands now.	Eyi ti jade ni ọwọ rẹ ni bayi.
I love it especially because it’s so simple.	Mo nifẹ paapaa nitori pe o rọrun pupọ.
We need to break them down here.	A nilo lati fọ wọn nibi.
I do not want to pass the time, as you call it.	Emi ko fẹ lati kọja awọn akoko, bi o ti pe o.
You don’t live here, you see, not really.	O ko gbe nibi, o ri, ko gan.
You have to stop.	O ni lati da.
But when you start the thing, you have to take care of it.	Ṣugbọn nigbati o ba bẹrẹ nkan naa, o ni lati tọju rẹ.
It cannot have both methods.	Ko le ni awọn ọna mejeeji.
He was beaten.	O ti lu.
I am a police officer, and a good one.	Mo jẹ ọlọpa, ati pe o dara kan.
Which makes me question myself.	Eyi ti o jẹ ki n beere lọwọ ara mi.
They were given and received.	Wọn fun wọn ni wọn si gba.
They have been together forever.	Wọn ti wa papọ lailai.
I can stop you, he told me.	Mo le da ọ duro, o sọ fun.
It is over with.	O ti pari pẹlu.
It's just not easy.	O kan ko rọrun.
The tests were repeated at least three times.	Awọn idanwo naa tun ṣe o kere ju igba mẹta.
He did not move.	O ko gbe.
Which means it's time to dump her.	Eyi ti o tumọ si pe akoko ti to.
No one died, more than one.	Ko si ọkan ti o ku, diẹ sii ju ọkan lọ.
Another thing you want to miss.	Ohun miiran ti o fẹ padanu.
Eat whatever you feel like at the moment.	Je ohunkohun ti o lero bi ni akoko.
This convinced me.	Eyi da mi loju.
Get on your own.	Gba lori ara rẹ.
I need you to know that.	Mo nilo rẹ lati mọ pe.
You do not see it.	O ko ri i.
If not, it may not be in the game at all.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, ko le wa sinu ere rara.
You are what you are, whatever you may decide to do.	Iwọ ni ohun ti o jẹ, ohunkohun ti o le pinnu lati ṣe.
We tested it for many years.	A ṣe idanwo naa fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
I just wonder why.	Mo kan ṣe iyalẹnu idi iyẹn.
I want to talk about them.	Mo fẹ lati sọrọ nipa wọn.
If he had, he would have done so.	Ti o ba jẹ pe, oun yoo ti ṣe bẹ tẹlẹ.
In many things.	Ninu ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
But you want to know how to raise the money.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ ni imọran bi o ṣe le gbe owo naa.
We believe that people are more important than games.	A gbagbọ pe eniyan ṣe pataki ju awọn ere lọ.
You have your plan.	O ni eto rẹ.
This is the best advice we have.	Eyi ni imọran ti o dara julọ ti a ni.
You do not ask how it is.	O ko beere bi o ṣe jẹ.
My family has watched me.	Idile mi ti wo mi.
It can be anything.	O le jẹ ohunkohun.
He looked like his father when he was angry.	O dabi baba rẹ nigbati o binu.
So treat us like you.	Nitorina tọju wa bi o.
I just try to do my thing even.	Mo kan gbiyanju lati ṣe nkan mi paapaa.
They both look at me.	Awọn mejeeji wo ohun si mi.
I am by your side whatever.	Mo wa ni ẹgbẹ rẹ ohunkohun ti.
They will pay with their lives.	Wọn yoo san pẹlu aye wọn.
Please pay your membership fee.	Jọwọ san owo ẹgbẹ rẹ.
You can decide for yourself.	O le pinnu fun ara rẹ.
I'll have to put it together for you.	Emi yoo ni lati fi papọ fun ọ.
None of them have information to help you.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o ni alaye lati ran ọ lọwọ.
Insert soon, it may be special for you.	Fi sii laipẹ, o ṣee ṣe ni pataki fun ọ.
Please anyone help me.	Jọwọ ẹnikẹni ran mi.
The other three worked.	Awọn mẹta miiran ṣiṣẹ.
I get up.	Mo dide.
Iron is an easy metal to work with.	Irin jẹ irin ti o rọrun lati ṣiṣẹ.
That was only morning.	Iyẹn jẹ owurọ nikan.
Okay, they told him.	O dara, wọn sọ fun u.
And it is not a good way to start your life.	Ati pe kii ṣe ọna ti o dara lati bẹrẹ ni igbesi aye rẹ.
Nothing can change that.	Ko si ohun ti o le yi iyẹn pada.
Needless to say.	Ko nilo lati sọ ohunkohun.
This is where your journey begins.	Eyi ni ibiti irin-ajo rẹ ti bẹrẹ.
It's been about two minutes.	O ti pẹ to iṣẹju meji.
Maybe you don’t need to be here for this.	Boya ko nilo lati wa nibi fun eyi.
You can not leave.	O ko le lọ kuro.
But the journey to that place was not easy.	Ṣugbọn irin-ajo lọ si ibi yẹn ko rọrun.
That is one thing.	Ohun kan niyẹn.
The last few weeks have been hard on him.	Awọn ọsẹ diẹ sẹhin ti jẹ lile lori rẹ.
They will know that there is something, especially the mother.	Wọn yoo mọ pe nkan kan wa, paapaa iya.
But we were here for a while.	Sugbon a wa nibi fun akoko kan.
If possible.	Ti o ba ti ṣee ṣe.
And they will never know.	Ati pe wọn kii yoo mọ.
You get to do what you love.	O gba lati ṣe ohun ti o nifẹ.
But nothing else.	Sugbon ko si ohun miiran.
I’m sure every other major student does the same.	Mo ni idaniloju pe gbogbo ọmọ ile-iwe pataki miiran ṣe kanna.
Next week they may find another girl.	Ni ọsẹ to nbọ wọn le wa ọmọbirin miiran.
Will stay there again.	Yoo duro nibẹ lẹẹkansi.
He is married, has children.	O ti ni iyawo, o ni awọn ọmọde.
Everyone has to help us.	Gbogbo eniyan ni lati ran wa lọwọ.
He is doing something wrong.	O n ṣe nkan ti ko dara.
To a child they have not decided.	Si ọmọ ti wọn ko ti pinnu.
He was determined to go as far as possible.	O ti pinnu lati lọ bi o ti ṣee ṣe.
He will go, we will not see him for a while.	Oun yoo lọ, a ko ni ri i fun igba diẹ.
He could not be arrested.	A ko le mu u.
I turned to myself and continued working.	Mo yipada si ara mi ati tẹsiwaju iṣẹ.
These shoes are easy to wash.	Awọn bata wọnyi rọrun lati wẹ.
No street yet !.	Ko si ita sibẹsibẹ!.
It makes everyone’s life.	O ṣe igbesi aye ti gbogbo eniyan.
Must be something in the water.	Gbọdọ jẹ nkan ninu omi.
She loves and laughs like a young girl.	O nifẹ ati rẹrin bi ọmọbirin ọdọ.
You can not do that.	O ko le ṣe iyẹn.
See and decide for yourself what you think.	Wo ki o pinnu fun ara rẹ ohun ti o ro.
Now, before it's too late.	Bayi, ṣaaju ki o to pẹ ju.
And you also know.	Ati pe o tun mọ.
But there are more, much more.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii wa, pupọ diẹ sii.
You can hear yourself.	O le gbọ ara rẹ.
I don’t need to know that.	Emi ko nilo lati mọ iyẹn.
You do not have to.	O ko ni lati.
Okay, that loves me.	O dara, iyẹn nifẹ mi.
He died to do his work.	O ku lati ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
Nothing for me.	Ko si nkankan fun mi.
I mean it must be.	Mo tumọ si pe o gbọdọ jẹ.
First, there is going.	Ni akọkọ, lilọ wa.
But you have to put it to work.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati fi si iṣẹ.
They would have known that this was not the case for some time now.	Wọn yoo ti mọ pe kii ṣe eyi fun igba diẹ bayi.
As you can see.	Bi o ti ri.
Very good !.	O dara pupọ!.
He did not say a word.	Ko sọ ọrọ kan.
You know it's good.	O mọ pe o dara.
Way too late.	Ọna ju pẹ.
I’m seeing things that can’t be forever.	Mo n rii awọn nkan ti ko le jẹ lailai.
You need to look at yourself.	O nilo lati wo ara rẹ.
I don’t have to.	Emi ko ni lati ṣe.
I have never heard anything like it.	Emi ko gbọ ohunkohun ti o dabi rẹ rara.
That's what they're good at.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti wọn dara ni.
But that ended in my opinion.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ni pe o pari ni ero mi.
He asked if the project was still open.	O beere boya iṣẹ naa ṣi ṣi silẹ.
Classes are going well, 'he said.	Awọn kilasi n lọ daradara,' o sọ.
The situation is a difficult one.	Ipo naa jẹ ipo ti o nira.
It is in text mode only.	O wa ni ipo ọrọ nikan.
So it looks like he's left there.	Nitorina o dabi pe o ti fi silẹ nibẹ.
No one wants to ask either.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹ lati beere boya.
You may also find that this helps.	O tun le rii pe eyi ṣe iranlọwọ.
He made his word.	O ṣe ọrọ rẹ.
Stop the car!	Duro ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa!
I'll have more tea.	Emi yoo fi tii diẹ si.
Women do.	Awọn obinrin ṣe awọn.
And one is a doctor.	Ati pe ọkan jẹ dokita.
There are no songs you can find.	Ko si awọn orin ti o le rii.
I am having problems in my system.	Mo n ni iṣoro ninu eto mi.
I do not agree with this idea.	Emi ko gba pẹlu ero yii.
I don’t think it will ever happen.	Emi ko ro pe o yoo ṣẹlẹ lailai.
But they also have two other problems.	Ṣugbọn wọn tun ni awọn iṣoro meji miiran.
We are here.	A wa nibi.
She was on the bed, and it seemed hard.	O wa lori ibusun, o si dabi lile.
However nothing there.	Sibẹsibẹ ko si nkankan nibẹ.
You will not stand.	Iwọ kii yoo duro.
He started his career and finished it.	O bẹrẹ iṣẹ rẹ o si pari rẹ.
We never talk again.	A ko sọrọ lẹẹkansi.
I still can't get things to work.	Emi ko tun le gba ohun lati ṣiṣẹ.
This is a high opinion.	Eyi jẹ ero giga.
The boy ran to him alone.	Ọmọkunrin naa sare fun u nikan.
I do a lot for you.	Mo ṣe pupọ fun ọ.
It has no power.	Ko ni agbara.
Small games help.	Awọn ere kekere ṣe iranlọwọ.
We need to come here more often.	A nilo lati wa si ibi diẹ sii nigbagbogbo.
Please see, this is you.	Jọwọ wo, eyi ni iwọ.
Forget about the money.	Gbagbe nipa owo naa.
Stay close.	Duro nitosi.
I will make a decision tomorrow.	Emi yoo ṣe ipinnu ni ọla.
It is important that this work goes well.	O ṣe pataki pe iṣẹ yii lọ daradara.
Work all the time.	Ṣiṣẹ ni gbogbo igba.
Some people say that age brings us wisdom.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan sọ pe ọjọ ori n mu ọgbọn wa.
Sometimes they are right.	Nigba miiran wọn tọ.
It matters what you put into your body.	O ṣe pataki ohun ti o fi sinu ara rẹ.
It is made of wood.	O ti fi igi ṣe.
He hit one of the boys.	O lu ọkan ninu awọn ọmọkunrin.
At the very least, we can try.	Ni o kere ju, a le gbiyanju.
I'm afraid of that.	Mo bẹru iyẹn.
He was a student in high school.	O jẹ ọmọ ile-iwe ni ile-iwe giga.
He always asked her for her breakfast.	Nigbagbogbo o beere lọwọ rẹ fun ounjẹ owurọ rẹ.
It makes sense.	O ni ori.
That's what it says.	Ohun ti o sọ niyẹn.
But a word from you can take it all away.	Ṣugbọn ọrọ kan lati ọdọ rẹ le mu gbogbo iyẹn lọ.
I don't want you to wait.	Emi ko fẹ ki o duro.
They think he is not lost.	Wọn ro pe ko padanu.
Come on, in some.	Wa, ni diẹ ninu.
It has to be done well.	O ni lati ṣee ṣe daradara.
Break others or let them break.	Fọ awọn miiran tabi jẹ ki wọn fọ.
Done.	Ti ṣe.
He told me to try it.	O so fun mi lati gbiyanju o.
I think he took his daughter back.	Mo ro pe o gba ọmọbirin rẹ pada.
When it was over, everyone was excited.	Nigbati o pari, gbogbo eniyan yọ.
He could not stop my people.	Ko le da awon eniyan mi duro.
Most women here have one or two children.	Pupọ awọn obinrin nibi ni ọmọ kan tabi meji.
Okay, we'll see.	O dara, a yoo rii.
The heat of the sun is hard.	Ooru ti oorun jẹ lile.
The party is over, my friends.	Ayẹyẹ naa ti pari, awọn ọrẹ mi.
I look forward to it.	Mo nireti pupọ.
We have to play by the rules.	A ni lati mu ṣiṣẹ nipa awọn ofin.
There are a few troubles along the way.	Awọn wahala diẹ wa ni ọna.
It's out.	O ti yọ jade.
Two ways of life communicate with each other.	Awọn ọna igbesi aye meji n sọrọ pẹlu ara wọn.
And not only this.	Ati pe kii ṣe eyi nikan.
I think it is for me.	Mo ro pe o jẹ fun mi.
We even know a lot of things are going to happen.	Paapaa a mọ ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Must be there.	Gbọdọ wa nibẹ.
You have to do it.	O ni lati ṣe.
Neither of them have any money.	Bẹni awọn ti wọn ni eyikeyi owo.
I should have paid more attention.	Mo ti yẹ ki o san akiyesi diẹ sii.
Look up if you want.	Wo soke ti o ba fẹ.
It's too late.	O ti pẹ.
And you want to know why.	Ati ki o fẹ lati mọ idi ti.
You do not see.	O ko ri.
It is too late for the celebration.	O de pẹ fun ayẹyẹ naa.
There were boys.	Awọn ọmọkunrin wà.
I have money to pay.	Mo ni owo lati san.
Not impossible, just let it be.	Ko ṣe ko ṣee ṣe, kan jẹ ki o le.
I miss you.	Mo padanu rẹ.
Do not take things that do not belong to you.	Maṣe gba awọn nkan ti kii ṣe tirẹ.
I did not try to stop him.	Emi ko gbiyanju lati da a duro.
People who don’t even live at home.	Awọn eniyan ti ko gbe ni ile paapaa.
It is very easy to operate.	O rọrun pupọ lati ṣiṣẹ.
I did not kill him.	Emi ko pa a.
Now it is very important.	Bayi jẹ pataki pupọ.
We haven't done much since.	A ko tii ṣe pupọ lati igba naa.
My sister can't change.	Arabinrin mi ko le yipada.
Maybe through day work.	Boya nipasẹ iṣẹ ọjọ.
I am not strong enough at this time.	Emi ko ni agbara mi ni akoko yii.
He did not worry about feeling her after a big meal.	Ko ṣe aniyan nipa rilara rilara rẹ lẹhin ounjẹ nla kan.
They have to do everything for him.	Wọn ni lati ṣe ohun gbogbo fun u.
I have not picked one since.	Emi ko mu ọkan kan lati igba naa.
Nothing.	Ko si ohun ti.
This happens a lot of times.	Eyi ṣẹlẹ ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
Everything he did was for him.	Ohun gbogbo ti o ṣe wà fun u.
They will lose to have a good life.	Wọn yoo padanu lati ni igbesi aye to dara.
You are not there.	Iwọ ko wa nibẹ.
To the end.	Si ipari.
I do not understand this question.	Emi ko loye ibeere yii.
Now that would be a story.	Bayi iyẹn yoo jẹ itan kan.
For me, that says a lot.	Fun mi, iyẹn sọ pupọ.
I hope this will improve the game.	Mo lero eyi yoo mu ere naa dara.
The man knew nothing.	Ọkunrin naa ko mọ nkankan.
That is very difficult to do.	Iyẹn nira pupọ lati ṣe.
I move from room to room.	Mo gbe lati yara si yara.
He did not think about that.	Ko ronu nipa iyẹn.
I think he will really enjoy it.	Mo ro pe oun yoo gbadun rẹ gaan.
Keep your sister very happy to me.	Pa arabinrin rẹ dun pupọ si mi.
It is important that you do well.	O ṣe pataki ki o ṣe daradara.
Not everyone will have.	Ko gbogbo eniyan yoo ni.
It’s just that we don’t.	O kan jẹ pe a ko ṣe.
I am a good student.	Mo jẹ ọmọ ile-iwe to dara.
We are all in it.	Gbogbo wa ni o.
And even those who do not always paint them.	Ati paapaa awọn ti o ṣe nigbagbogbo ko kun wọn.
I love what it stands for.	Mo nifẹ ohun ti o duro fun.
They are forever.	Wọn wa lailai.
I hope you are well.	Mo nireti pe o dara.
They are the only things that happen.	Wọn jẹ awọn nkan ti o ṣẹlẹ nikan.
Fees have been passed into law.	Awọn owo ti a ti kọja sinu ofin.
Songs like that make us very happy.	Awọn orin bii iyẹn jẹ ki inu wa dun pupọ.
It doesn't matter what.	Ko ṣe pataki kini.
The school made a mistake on the final exam.	Ile-iwe naa ṣe aṣiṣe lori idanwo ikẹhin.
It looks like we got out as soon as we needed to.	O dabi pe a jade ni kete ti a nilo.
He drove across the road.	O si wakọ kọja ni opopona.
But we have a job here.	Sugbon a ni ise kan nibi.
He did not do that for many years.	Ko ṣe iyẹn fun ọdun pupọ.
Two things so simple.	Meji ohun ki o rọrun.
But it is too late for that.	Sugbon o ti pẹ ju fun iyẹn.
The day is hot.	Ọjọ naa ti gbona.
Sometimes nothing is right.	Nigba miiran ko si ohun ti o tọ.
They are just wrong.	Wọn kan ko tọ si.
My body and my mother.	Ara mi ati iya mi.
He put himself in their shoes.	O fi ara rẹ sinu bata wọn.
Everything needs time.	Ohun gbogbo nilo akoko.
Everything is wrong here.	Ohun gbogbo ti ko tọ jade nibi.
Like the sea, he thought.	Bi okun, o ro.
They are waiting for the train.	Wọn n duro de ọkọ oju irin naa.
Look at my mother.	Wo iya mi.
Let's talk a little.	Jẹ ki a sọrọ diẹ.
He is the only one who will have understood what it means.	Oun nikan ni ẹniti yoo ti loye ohun ti o le tumọ si.
Her clothes are torn.	Aṣọ rẹ ti ya.
Which is very new to me.	Eyi ti o jẹ tuntun pupọ si mi.
Many people died from injuries caused by cars.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ku lati awọn ipalara ti o fa nipasẹ awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
Do it forever.	Ṣe o lailai.
I still have that picture.	Mo tun ni aworan iyẹn.
I will be your favorite traveler.	Emi yoo di irin-ajo ayanfẹ rẹ.
People are very happy about it.	Awọn eniyan dun pupọ nipa rẹ.
There is no plan for the whole program.	Ko si eto fun gbogbo eto.
Field objects.	Awọn nkan aaye.
But they give the children parents and of course money.	Sugbon ti won fi fun awọn ọmọ awọn obi ati ti awọn dajudaju owo.
It can last up to three days, especially here.	O le ṣiṣe ni ọjọ mẹta, paapaa nibi.
That’s my highest priority.	Iyẹn ga julọ awọn ifẹ mi.
Sometimes, they do not understand.	Nigba miiran, wọn ko ni oye.
I have no money now.	Nko ni owo kankan bayi.
Wrap the material.	Fi ipari si ohun elo naa.
Now it is happening again.	Bayi o tun n ṣẹlẹ si i.
All my friends are here.	Gbogbo awọn ọrẹ mi wa nibi.
These people wearing clothes are bad news.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi ti o wọ aṣọ jẹ awọn iroyin buburu.
No, that is not true.	Rara, iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
Everyone here does.	Gbogbo eniyan nibi ṣe.
He refuses to believe.	O kọ lati gbagbọ.
And nothing has changed.	Ati pe ko si ohun ti o yipada.
There was only one other advantage.	Nibẹ wà nikan kan miiran anfani.
I do not want to hurt him.	Emi ko fẹ lati ṣe ipalara fun u.
You go down to find us.	O lọ si isalẹ lati wa.
Or maybe he's dead.	Tabi boya o ti ku.
Let my heart be easy '.	Jẹ ki ọkan mi rọrun'.
We are not convinced that this is the right way to go.	A ko ni idaniloju pe eyi ni ọna ti o tọ.
Which makes you wonder if they know.	Eyi ti o mu ki o ṣe iyalẹnu boya wọn mọ.
The boats are full of passengers.	Awọn ọkọ oju omi ti kun fun awọn ero.
The idea is simple because of its purpose.	Ero naa rọrun nitori idi rẹ.
People believe what they want to believe.	Awọn eniyan gbagbọ ohun ti wọn fẹ gbagbọ.
She looked down and saw the boy under her.	O wo isalẹ o si ri ọmọkunrin naa labẹ rẹ.
That is not a new concept.	Iyẹn kii ṣe imọran tuntun.
He did not see anything.	Ko wo ohunkohun.
Maybe even not the tallest people.	Boya paapaa kii ṣe awọn eniyan ti o ga julọ.
Cut through what you are reading.	Ge nipasẹ ohun ti o n ka.
I read your book.	Mo ka iwe rẹ.
Do not try this at home.	Maṣe gbiyanju eyi ni ile.
Okay, time will tell.	O dara, akoko yoo sọ.
The house is small.	Ile jẹ kekere.
They live inside.	Wọn gbe inu.
He took her.	O mu u lọ.
He is my brother.	Arakunrin mi ni.
I texted him a little while back.	Mo ti fi ọrọ ranṣẹ si i diẹ diẹ sẹhin.
That’s another reason we live, you know.	Iyẹn ni idi miiran ti a gbe, o mọ.
So, what can you say?	Nitorina, kini o le sọ?
So did all the members of the team.	Bẹẹ ni gbogbo ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti irin-ajo naa ṣe.
Or if you do.	Tabi ti o ba ṣe.
A feran re gaan.	A feran re gaan.
No idea about that, sorry.	Ko si ero nipa iyẹn, binu.
The water will be very hot.	Omi yoo gbona pupọ.
New books have appeared this year.	Awọn iwe tuntun ti han ni ọdun yii.
Both things require a lot of human time.	Awọn nkan mejeeji ti o nilo ọpọlọpọ awọn wakati eniyan.
We are in it together now.	A wa ninu rẹ papọ ni bayi.
Whatever.	Ohunkohun ti.
This is all true.	Eyi ni gbogbo otitọ.
Which, to be honest, you can.	Eyi ti, lati jẹ otitọ, o le.
I stopped.	Mo duro.
Can't expect more.	Ko le reti diẹ sii.
If they see one, they can see what the company is doing.	Ti wọn ba rii ọkan, wọn le rii kini ile-iṣẹ ṣe.
You have to walk through the city, to high school.	O ni ki a rin nipasẹ ilu, si ile-iwe giga.
He is also with her.	O tun wa pẹlu rẹ.
Now to go home and sleep.	Bayi lati lọ si ile ati ki o sun oorun.
Obviously the community wants this.	O han gbangba pe agbegbe fẹ eyi.
Puppies are game.	Ọmọ aja jẹ ere.
Don't tell anyone you're leaving.	Maṣe sọ fun ẹnikẹni pe o n jade.
We deal with our human friends, especially.	A ṣe pẹlu awọn ọrẹ eniyan wa, paapaa.
I wonder if they can be.	Mo Iyanu ti won le jẹ.
Now we are here.	Bayi a wa nibi.
I proceed before the world to say anything.	Mo tẹsiwaju ṣaaju ki o to ni aye lati sọ ohunkohun.
Children forced into the streets without parents.	Awọn ọmọde fi agbara mu si awọn opopona laisi obi.
More such boats will arrive.	Diẹ sii iru awọn ọkọ oju omi yoo de.
Work with it.	Ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
I understand it better now, a little more.	Mo loye rẹ dara julọ ni bayi, diẹ diẹ.
Please read it when you have some time.	Jọwọ ka rẹ nigbati o ba ni akoko diẹ.
But that is not for me.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe fun mi.
I'm sure it will be nice and home in no time !.	Mo ni idaniloju pe yoo dara ati ile ni akoko kankan!.
Obviously the port is not working.	O han gbangba pe ibudo naa ko ṣiṣẹ.
The lights.	Awọn oju ina.
I hate that name.	Mo korira orukọ naa.
There are some things even money cannot buy.	Awọn nkan kan wa paapaa owo ko le ra.
People have to do it manually.	Eniyan ni lati ṣe pẹlu ọwọ.
Not wondering why.	Kii ṣe iyalẹnu idi.
It never came back, it never happened again.	Ko pada wa, ko tun ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
You get things done.	O gba awọn nkan ṣe.
And most of you.	Ati julọ iwọ.
I plan to.	Mo gbero lati.
Or say nothing.	Tabi ko sọ nkankan.
You better see yourself.	O dara ki o wo ara rẹ.
I do not know anything about it.	Emi ko mọ nkankan nipa rẹ.
His tone is a bit off.	Ohun orin rẹ jẹ diẹ.
But it was great.	Sugbon o je nla.
This dress is so cute!	Aṣọ yii dara pupọ!
It was a beautiful morning.	O je kan lẹwa owurọ.
I'm sure you also remember.	Mo daju pe o tun ranti.
What are you ?.	Iwọ kini?.
You have to work for what you want.	O ni lati ṣiṣẹ fun ohun ti o fẹ.
How things sound out.	Bawo ni ohun dun jade.
It takes up a lot of space.	O gba aaye pupọ.
I know my class does.	Mo mọ mi kilasi ṣe.
I will also be here for you people if you need me.	Emi yoo tun wa nibi fun yin eniyan ti o ba nilo mi.
The fire can even start.	Ina le paapaa bẹrẹ.
For men, it just annoys us.	Fun awọn ọkunrin, o kan binu wa.
I can make her happy.	Mo ti le ṣe rẹ dun.
I am close to your family.	Mo wa nitosi idile rẹ.
It is the last thing you need.	O jẹ ohun ti o kẹhin ti o nilo.
Sorry for that, but there is a reason.	Ma binu fun iyẹn, ṣugbọn idi kan wa.
You have no idea how these people feel.	O ko ni imọran bi awọn eniyan wọnyi ṣe lero.
It will not be.	Ko ni le.
I will listen, and try to do my best.	Emi yoo gbọ, ati lati gbiyanju lati ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
I wish we had more for our money.	Mo fẹ pe a ni diẹ sii fun owo wa.
The water should be warm now.	Omi yẹ ki o gbona bayi.
People ask this because they do not know what else to understand.	Awọn eniyan beere eyi nitori wọn ko mọ kini ohun miiran lati ni oye.
Don't do this about me.	Maṣe ṣe eyi nipa mi.
You have to make a game plan for him.	O ni lati ṣe eto ere fun u.
He would not tell me much about it.	Oun ko ni sọ pupọ fun mi nipa rẹ.
I mean, you're still talking to me.	Mo tumọ si, iwọ tun n ba mi sọrọ.
I do not know anything about this.	Emi ko mọ nkankan nipa eyi.
Get the car out today.	Gbe ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ jade loni.
We never heard back.	A ko gbọ pada.
That was always a problem for him.	Iyẹn nigbagbogbo jẹ iṣoro fun u.
It should come out more.	O yẹ ki o jade diẹ sii.
Of course it opened my life.	Dajudaju o ṣii aye mi.
The man ran.	Ọkunrin naa sare.
Again, he did so so that he could get out of work early.	Lẹẹkansi, o ṣe bẹ ki o le jade kuro ni iṣẹ ni kutukutu.

A little surprising, though.	Iyalẹnu diẹ, paapaa.

Why not try another?	Kilode ti o ko gbiyanju miiran?
Take them if you must.	Mu wọn ti o ba gbọdọ.
Her eyes open.	Awọn oju rẹ ṣii.
Other than that it is just amazing !.	Miiran ju ti o jẹ o kan iyanu!.

You’ve seen something like it.	O ti sọ ri nkankan bi o ri.
Trees rose on both sides of it.	Awọn igi dide ni ẹgbẹ mejeeji ti rẹ.
That is a great reward.	Ere nla niyẹn.
Now they can not.	Bayi wọn ko le.
He could not imagine what happened to himself.	Ko le ro ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si ara rẹ.
You will get an error.	Iwọ yoo gba aṣiṣe.

There is no room for anger now.	Ko si aaye lati binu ni bayi.
A boy asked his mother where the children came from.	Ọmọkunrin kan beere lọwọ iya rẹ nibo ni awọn ọmọde ti wa.
They don’t like each other, they say.	Wọn ko fẹran ara wọn, wọn sọ.
Maybe he thought he was an old friend.	Boya o ro pe o jẹ ọrẹ atijọ kan.
How much do they charge?	Iye owo wo ni wọn gba?
She tells him she can't wait.	O sọ fun u pe ko le duro.
That was a few minutes of his life.	Iyẹn jẹ iṣẹju diẹ ti igbesi aye rẹ.

He killed it as not a big deal.	O pa a bi kii ṣe nkan nla.
What a wonderful life they should live.	Iru igbesi aye iyanu wo ni wọn gbọdọ gbe.

But maybe it is true.	Ṣugbọn boya o jẹ otitọ.
You do not know any of the rules.	O ko mọ eyikeyi ninu awọn ofin.

The problems are back.	Awọn iṣoro pada ti lọ.
I'll take your word for it.	Emi yoo gba ọrọ rẹ fun.
It has changed the face of the community.	O ti yi oju ti agbegbe pada.
It was the first time he really thought about it.	O jẹ igba akọkọ ti o ronu nipa rẹ gaan.
No one knows where he is.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ ibiti o wa.
Maybe because he was young, he thought things would change.	Boya nitori pe o jẹ ọdọ, o ro pe awọn nkan yoo yipada.
If you have a day bag, carry it.	Ti o ba ni apo ọjọ kan, gbe e.

Okay, one room.	O dara, yara kan.

You can teach it both ways.	O le kọ ọ ni ọna mejeeji.
It's on time.	O wa lori akoko.
I killed my best friend today.	Mo pa ọrẹ mi to dara julọ loni.
The brother was angry that the meeting had been postponed.	Arakunrin naa binu pe ipade naa ti da duro.
Can't see it now.	Ko le wo rẹ ni bayi.
This is similar to what happens to the body.	Eyi jẹ iru si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si ara.
Give the sun and all that.	Fun ni oorun ati gbogbo awọn ti o.
Let's start there and work our way down to earth.	Jẹ ká bẹrẹ nibẹ ki o si ṣiṣẹ ọna wa si isalẹ lati aye.

This is a problem with that.	Eyi ni iṣoro pẹlu iyẹn.
There is a time when testing methods are just as bad.	Akoko kan wa nigbati awọn ọna idanwo jẹ bi buburu.
It came into its own.	O de inu ara rẹ.
The plane is climbing up.	Ọkọ ofurufu n gun oke.
These stories do not grow with us.	Awọn itan wọnyi ko dagba pẹlu wa.
It was a mistake, the man said.	O jẹ aṣiṣe, ọkunrin naa sọ.
You lose what belongs to you.	O padanu ohun ti o jẹ tirẹ.

In this case, we should not refuse such help.	Ni idi eyi, a ko yẹ ki o kọ iru iranlọwọ bẹẹ.

Only for a while.	Nikan fun akoko kan.
Okay, so.	O dara, bẹ.
It’s like what it feels like to grow up.	O dabi ohun ti o lero bi lati dagba soke.
But not here.	Ṣugbọn ko si nibi.
It is the only possible explanation.	O jẹ alaye ti o ṣeeṣe nikan.
He obviously loves the job.	O han gbangba pe o nifẹ iṣẹ naa.
Of course not a good idea.	Dajudaju kii ṣe imọran to dara.
But when he found the boy he was not there.	Ṣugbọn nigbati o wa ọmọkunrin naa ko si nibẹ.
A chance of rain.	A anfani ti ojo.
Two problems, in fact.	Awọn iṣoro meji, ni otitọ.
They always have a gift for you when you visit.	Wọn nigbagbogbo ni ẹbun fun ọ nigbati o ba ṣabẹwo.
They can't run with me.	Wọn ko le sare pẹlu mi.
Many people do things they do not like.	Pupọ eniyan ṣe awọn iṣẹ ti wọn ko fẹran.
It happens to all of us.	O ṣẹlẹ si gbogbo wa.
Take a few minutes and open your heart.	Gba iṣẹju diẹ ki o ṣii ọkan rẹ.
Great to be together again, of course.	Nla lati wa papọ lẹẹkansi, dajudaju.
Just let me live.	O kan jẹ ki n gbe.
Their plan is not noticeable with most people, however.	Eto wọn ko ṣe akiyesi pẹlu ọpọlọpọ eniyan, sibẹsibẹ.
At one point we did.	Ni akoko kan a ṣe.
The last one is the key area for me.	Eyi ti o kẹhin ni agbegbe bọtini fun mi.
He lost everything.	O padanu ohun gbogbo.

They break up because you won't sleep with it.	Wọn ti ya soke nitori o yoo ko sun pẹlu rẹ.
It was a hot day.	O je kan gbona ọjọ.

At least he did what he loved.	O kere ju o ku ṣe ohun ti o nifẹ.
People ask how it happened.	Eniyan beere bi o ti ṣẹlẹ.
Look me in the eye.	Wo mi ni oju.
He will be here in a minute.	Oun yoo wa nibi ni iṣẹju kan.
We sold that day for sure.	A ta ọjọ yẹn daju.
In his life there he knew little.	Ninu igbesi aye rẹ nibẹ o mọ diẹ.
To this day of course.	Titi di oni dajudaju.
That sounds good.	Iyẹn dara dara.
He asked more questions.	O beere awọn ibeere diẹ sii.
We talked about it after the game.	A ti sọrọ nipa rẹ lẹhin ti awọn ere.
Why not stick to it.	Idi ti ko duro lori.

We want to know what will happen if they come together.	A fẹ lati mọ ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ ti wọn ba wa papọ.

This is coming from the very top.	Eyi n wa lati oke pupọ.
You think you mean something through it.	O ro pe o tumọ nkan nipasẹ rẹ.

Something else is at work, especially.	Nkankan miiran wa ni iṣẹ, paapaa.

Her sister did not know.	Arabinrin rẹ ti ko mọ.
I could do one more like that.	Mo le ṣe ọkan diẹ sii bi iyẹn.
But for some reason, this method did not work.	Ṣugbọn fun idi kan, ọna yii ko ṣiṣẹ.

You don't feel anything anymore.	O ko lero nkankan mọ.
I think it should be played.	Mo ro pe o yẹ ki a mu ṣiṣẹ.
That is yours.	Tirẹ niyẹn.
They have lost their mother, their son, their brother.	Wọn ti padanu iya wọn, ọmọ wọn, arakunrin wọn.
I did what I was asked to do.	Mo ṣe ohun ti a beere lọwọ mi.
Even so, his father was such a big deal.	Paapaa, baba rẹ jẹ iru adehun nla kan.
You think you looked at this site.	O ro pe o wo aaye yii.
You must not leave your bed.	Iwọ ko gbọdọ lọ kuro ni ibusun rẹ.

People will never forget.	Eniyan yoo ko gbagbe.

All of these can be considered as well.	Gbogbo awọn wọnyi le ṣe akiyesi ni bi daradara.
I have watched it since you came here.	Mo ti wo o lati igba ti o wa si ibi.
We would have hated each other before long.	A yoo ti korira ara wa ṣaaju ki o to gun.
We accept that they are not.	A gba pe wọn kii ṣe.
It depends on a lot of people.	O da lori ọpọlọpọ eniyan.

This book would not have been possible without them.	Iwe yii ko ba ṣeeṣe laisi wọn.
I'll be glad when it ends.	Emi yoo dun nigbati o ba pari.
Some are married, some are not.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti wa ni iyawo, diẹ ninu awọn ni o wa ko.
It cannot be done by life.	Ko le ṣe nipasẹ aye.

She told him it was going well.	O sọ fun u pe o ti lọ daradara.
This house felt like that.	Ile yi ro bi wipe.
I'm happy now.	Inu mi dun ni bayi.
I hope to see you soon.	Mo nireti lati ri ọ laipẹ.
That’s good by me.	Iyẹn dara nipasẹ mi.
If you are here you can tell us in words.	Ti o ba wa nibi o le sọ fun wa ni awọn ọrọ.
Nothing has changed here, either.	Ko si ohun ti yi pada nibi, boya.
So it is not easy.	Nitorina ko rọrun.
The same thing happened to another woman.	Ohun kan naa lo ṣẹlẹ si obinrin miiran.
He will see them through.	Oun yoo rii wọn nipasẹ.
We can change our words.	A le yi ọrọ wa pada.
They want to be family.	Wọn fẹ lati jẹ idile.
I will not give up.	Emi ko ni gba.
Go across the environment.	Lọ kọja ayika.
He missed it.	O padanu rẹ.
Everyone knows that.	Gbogbo eniyan lo mọ iyẹn.
Not at all.	Ko ṣe rara.

I can live with a woman who has no love for anyone.	Mo le gbe pẹlu obinrin kan ti ko ni ife fun ẹnikẹni.
The process is simple.	Ọna naa rọrun.
Everyone says the same thing, after all.	Gbogbo eniyan sọ ohun kanna, lẹhin.
I love a good picture of myself.	Mo ni ife kan ti o dara aworan ti ara mi.
Which device does not matter.	Ẹrọ wo ni ko ṣe pataki.
He brought us.	O mu wa.
That observation is of little consequence.	Ti akiyesi jẹ ti kekere Nitori.
This is the sea.	Eyi ni okun.
She is interested in some art or concept of herself.	O nifẹ pẹlu diẹ ninu aworan tabi imọran ti ararẹ.
We can work below or above.	A le ṣiṣẹ ni isalẹ tabi oke.
Or how a situation changes.	Tabi bi ipo kan ṣe yipada.
Music is usually played at weddings.	Orin ni a maa n dun nigbagbogbo ni awọn igbeyawo.
They can not do everything.	Wọn ko le ṣe ohun gbogbo.
It's in.	O wa ninu.
The truth is that there is no.	Otitọ ni pe ko si.
I want to come back and say something about it.	Mo fẹ lati pada wa sọ nkankan nipa rẹ.
It was a powerful thing.	O je ohun agbara.
The ones we already know are in wooden boxes.	Awọn ti a ti mọ tẹlẹ wa ninu awọn apoti igi.
These strings are always on.	Awọn okun wọnyi wa lori nigbagbogbo.
There are no trains operating in this area.	Ko si awọn ọkọ oju irin ti n ṣiṣẹ ni agbegbe yii.
You get more injuries.	O gba awọn ipalara diẹ sii.
Your life is less important than any other.	Aye rẹ ko ṣe pataki ju eyikeyi miiran lọ.
But this is not the only miracle that happens.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe ohun iyanu nikan ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Well, you should put yourself to the test.	Daradara, o yẹ ki o fi ara rẹ si idanwo.
There is nothing special about making me.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣe pataki nipa ṣiṣe mi.
You just can’t get bad food.	O kan ko le gba ounjẹ ti ko dara.
Take care of your children.	Tọju awọn ọmọ rẹ.
But you can not be with us.	Ṣugbọn o ko le wa pẹlu wa.
I can not think such is the law.	Emi ko le ro pe iru ni ofin.
The man took a drink.	Ọkunrin naa gba ohun mimu.
Just look.	O kan wo.
Man cannot touch.	Eniyan ko le fi ọwọ kan.
The phone will be very hot.	Foonu naa yoo gbona gaan.
But that does not work either.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣiṣẹ boya.
We never talk about it again.	A ko sọrọ nipa rẹ lẹẹkansi.
If you think it is well written, do the same.	Ti o ba ro pe o ti kọ daradara, ṣe kanna.
That will not happen to us.	Iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ si wa.
Maybe it’s your night time.	Boya o wa ni akoko alẹ rẹ.
In a big way.	Ni ọna nla.
It will stop, he thought.	Yoo duro, o ro.
I know this is a big decision.	Mo mọ pe ipinnu nla ni eyi.
We have no eyes on the upper side.	A ko ni oju ni ẹgbẹ oke naa.
I was less afraid of him.	Mo ti wà kere bẹru rẹ.
He did not like this teacher at all.	Ko fẹran olukọ yii rara.
They are on a boat.	Wọn wa lori ọkọ oju omi kan.
But some people may not like it.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu awọn eniyan le ma fẹran rẹ.
It's easy to go from here.	O rọrun lati lọ lati ibi.
I am angry with him.	Mo binu si i.
Any place will do.	Eyikeyi ibi yoo ṣe.
You will see your child.	Iwọ yoo ri ọmọ rẹ.
But in the end it did.	Sugbon ni ipari o ṣe.
On working days, however.	Lori awọn ọjọ ti o ṣiṣẹ, sibẹsibẹ.
I know how it looks.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe ri.
Carry on.	Maṣe lo.
They met at a local restaurant.	Wọn pade ni ile ounjẹ agbegbe kan.
Of course he is not someone to ask for.	Dajudaju oun kii ṣe ẹnikan lati beere fun.
In this way, it is not.	Ni ọna yii, kii ṣe iyẹn.
You should read the newspaper.	O yẹ ki o ka iwe iroyin naa.
I do not see this.	Emi ko ri eyi.
Not after all this time.	Ko lẹhin gbogbo akoko yi.
Or whatever it was.	Tabi ohunkohun ti o wà.
We just have to figure out how to do it.	A kan ni lati ro ero bi a ṣe le ṣe.
Simple system.	Eto ti o rọrun.
We have a great team.	A ni ẹgbẹ nla kan.
The whole house has been rebuilt.	Gbogbo ile naa ti tun ṣe.
I picked what they would need.	Mo ti gbe ohun ti won yoo nilo.
Therefore, we may not consider this matter.	Nitorina, a le ma ṣe akiyesi ọrọ yii.
You can wait now.	O le duro ni bayi.
I am convinced.	Mo da mi loju.
The other two points are noteworthy.	Awọn aaye meji miiran jẹ akiyesi akiyesi.
To search or to go after.	Lati wa tabi lọ lẹhin.
Well, not really.	O dara, kii ṣe ofin gaan dajudaju.
The way you like your teachers.	Ni ọna ti o fẹran awọn olukọ rẹ.
Was a great time.	Je nla akoko.
It can be seen in your eyes.	O le rii ni oju rẹ.
This will not work at all.	Eyi kii yoo ṣiṣẹ rara.
Like the best thing ever.	Bi ohun ti o dara julọ lailai.
Put things together and do something new.	Pa awọn nkan papọ ki o ṣe nkan tuntun.
It does not help.	Ko ṣe iranlọwọ.
I can make those decisions myself.	Mo le ṣe awọn ipinnu yẹn funrararẹ.
That is not my home.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ile mi.
I know you better than anyone.	Mo mọ ọ ju ẹnikẹni lọ.
The future is now.	Ojo iwaju ti di bayi.
He’s working on it.	O n ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ.
You have done a good job.	O ti ṣe kan ti o dara ise.
We have another meeting in an hour.	A ni ipade miiran ni wakati kan.
I am here to see my father.	Mo wa nibi lati ri baba mi.
This is their game.	Eyi ni ere wọn.
You get too much.	O gba ju lọ.
I can remember that much.	Mo le ranti pe Elo.
I called their hand to that one.	Mo pe ọwọ wọn si ọkan yẹn.
For our family.	Fun idile wa.
Bad, bad bad bad.	Buburu, aṣiṣe buburu buburu.
All, of course.	Gbogbo, dajudaju.
This world is amazing.	Ile aye ni eyi jẹ iyalẹnu.
Times have changed.	Awọn akoko ti yipada.
You already said.	O ti sọ tẹlẹ.
Do not talk to them!	Maṣe ba wọn sọrọ!
You never know what you're going to do.	O ko mọ ohun ti o ṣe.
It happens again and again.	O ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
I know it’s a lot to drink.	Mo mọ pe o jẹ pupọ lati mu.
Much has happened since then.	Elo ti ṣẹlẹ lati igba naa.
Sorry about getting up waiting for you for lunch.	Ma binu nipa dide duro fun ọ fun ounjẹ ọsan.
Not always.	Kii ṣe bẹ nigbagbogbo.
Are they right ?.	Ṣe wọn tọ?.
This will be done in two ways.	Eyi yoo ṣee ṣe ni ọna meji.
That is no longer true.	Iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ mọ.
It was beyond anything they told me to expect.	O kọja ohunkohun ti wọn sọ fun mi lati nireti.
Someone got up.	Ẹnikan ga soke.
I am a very good person.	Emi ni eniyan ti o dara pupọ.
This does not work.	Eyi ko ṣiṣẹ.
I don’t see any way around that.	Emi ko rii ọna eyikeyi ni ayika yẹn.
But this cannot be easy to do.	Ṣugbọn eyi a ko le rọrun lati ṣe.
Much depends on how we grow.	Pupọ rẹ da lori bawo ni a ṣe dagba.
My son is not with me.	Ọmọ mi ko wa pẹlu mi.
Pull to the side and remove.	Fa si ẹgbẹ ki o yọ kuro.
You start to understand.	O bẹrẹ lati ni oye.
I think a man tried to.	Mo ro pe ọkunrin kan gbiyanju lati.
He will have to leave.	Oun yoo ni lati lọ kuro.
Or do it yourself.	Tabi ṣe ara rẹ.
The game has to be removed.	Ere naa ni lati yọ kuro.
You don't see a student anymore.	O ko ri ọmọ ile-iwe mọ.
I have the best things to do with my heart.	Mo ni awọn nkan ti o dara julọ lati ṣe pẹlu ọkan mi.
In most cases.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
And from myself.	Ati lati ara mi.
You do not need to ask.	O ko nilo lati beere.
Any of them can be short-lived.	Eyikeyi ninu wọn le jẹ igba diẹ.
Many also grow here, in fact some across the street.	Ọpọlọpọ tun dagba nibi, ni otitọ diẹ ninu awọn kọja ita.
She fears you will hurt your child.	O bẹru pe iwọ yoo ṣe ọmọ rẹ ni ipalara.
I will not go back.	Emi kii yoo pada sẹhin.
Nothing can stop me!	Ko si ohun ti o le da mi!
His mouth did not know what to do with them.	Ẹnu rẹ ko mọ ohun ti yoo ṣe pẹlu wọn.
There is a way to get that out.	Ṣe ọna kan wa lati gba iyẹn jade.
At this point, he does not stay in the world.	Ni aaye yii, ko duro ni aye.
Do not change.	Maṣe yi pada.
He is my big brother.	Arakunrin mi nla ni.
What if there is no such thing as money?	Ti ko ba si iru nkan bi owo nko?
We really don't want it anymore.	A ko fẹ gaan mọ.
Life on earth.	Igbesi aye gbe lori aye.
I don’t want my child to do what he does.	Emi ko fẹ ki ọmọ mi ṣe ohun ti o ṣe.
He came into this place and now.	O wa sinu ibi ati bayi.
There are problems with both systems.	Awọn iṣoro wa pẹlu awọn ọna ṣiṣe mejeeji.
You need to get out there.	O nilo lati jade nibẹ.
I seem, in fact.	Mo dabi, ni otitọ.
Essentially, this is what your hair looks like.	Ni pataki, eyi ni ohun ti irun rẹ dabi.
The whole world.	Gbogbo aye wa.
They’re going really well.	Wọn n lọ gaan gaan.
I tried this and it didn’t give me any errors.	Mo gbiyanju eyi ati pe ko fun mi ni awọn aṣiṣe eyikeyi.
Another old friend from school.	Ọrẹ atijọ miiran lati ile-iwe.
He has not yet returned home.	Ko tii pada si ile.
This will make your legs longer.	Eyi yoo jẹ ki awọn ẹsẹ rẹ gun.
It is their way of life.	O jẹ ọna igbesi aye wọn.
Some of us have changed.	Diẹ ninu wa ti yipada.
You live and love here.	O gbe ati ki o feran nibi.
He ran downstairs.	O sare si isalẹ.
And today he did.	Ati loni o ṣe.
This is the last question.	Eyi ni ibeere ti o kẹhin.
They are little kids, little kids.	Wọn jẹ awọn ọmọde kekere, awọn ọmọde kekere.
I worked my way through.	Mo ti ṣiṣẹ ọna mi nipasẹ.
I don’t get my facts about the game from him, however.	Emi ko gba awọn otitọ mi nipa ere lati ọdọ rẹ, sibẹsibẹ.
She did very well, especially for her first time.	O ṣe daradara pupọ, paapaa fun igba akọkọ rẹ.
That was a little while back.	Iyẹn jẹ diẹ diẹ sẹhin.
But they did and we are here.	Ṣugbọn wọn ṣe ati pe a wa nibi.
Beautiful, she said, and looked at how she wrote.	Lẹwa, o sọ, o si wo bi o ṣe kọ silẹ.
Works well too.	Ṣiṣẹ daradara paapaa.
This will not help people.	Eyi kii yoo ran eniyan lọwọ.
We thought it was pretty cool.	A ro pe o lẹwa lẹwa.
I know that at some point it did.	Mo mọ pe ni akoko kan o ṣe.
They will know you are here.	Wọn yoo mọ pe o wa nibi.
That would be nice.	Iyẹn yoo dara.
And honest thinking can lift you up.	Ati pe ero otitọ le fa ọ soke.
The game has two finals.	Ere naa ni awọn ipari meji.
They are not sure if they have.	Ko da wọn loju boya wọn ti ni.
So he started laughing again.	Nitorina o tun bẹrẹ si rẹrin.
He hadn’t been to school the day before either.	Oun ko ti lọ si ile-iwe ni ọjọ ṣaaju boya.
One sister is missing.	Arabinrin kan ti padanu.
Tell him we want to talk to him.	Sọ fun u pe a fẹ lati ba a sọrọ.
Together they are on a small side.	Papọ wọn wa lori ẹgbẹ kekere kan.
For us, news is news.	Fun wa, awọn iroyin jẹ iroyin.
We will celebrate.	A yoo ṣe ayẹyẹ kan.
He carried me with him everywhere.	O gbe mi pẹlu rẹ nibi gbogbo.
You do not want to do this.	O ko fẹ lati ṣe eyi.
It will be a while before that happens.	Yoo pẹ diẹ ṣaaju ki iyẹn to ṣẹlẹ.
We are husband and wife.	A jẹ ọkunrin ati iyawo.
But because it is a news story.	Ṣugbọn nitori pe o jẹ itan iroyin.
I stand on my feet.	Mo duro lori ẹsẹ mi.
It seems.	O dabi.
She is doing well.	O n ṣe daradara.
See picture.	Wo aworan.
What makes them interested is to make them worthy.	Ohun ti o jẹ ki wọn nifẹ si ni lati jẹ ki wọn yẹ.
This is not enough.	Eyi ko to.
She is only washing her hands.	O n fo ọwọ rẹ nikan.
The water is good.	Omi naa dara.
His decision to leave the past alone began to be questioned.	Ipinnu rẹ lati lọ kuro ni ohun ti o ti kọja nikan bẹrẹ si ṣiyemeji.
Will this work ?.	Ṣe eyi yoo ṣiṣẹ?.
There is only one to come.	Ọkan nikan ni lati wa.
It belongs to her mother, she said.	O jẹ ti iya rẹ, o sọ.
The schools are incredibly good.	Awọn ile-iwe jẹ iyalẹnu dara.
We wish we had spent the day there.	A fẹ pe a ba ti lo ọjọ naa nibẹ.
It was if.	O je ti o ba ti.
O pa a.	O pa a.
Give it to him and you’re done for it.	Fi fun u ati pe o ti pari fun.
I received a letter from you.	Mo gba lẹta kan lati ọdọ rẹ.
Maybe you can't.	Boya o ko le.
That is, boys, you think.	Iyẹn ni, awọn ọmọkunrin, o ro.
Teachers of several communities were introduced.	Awọn olukọ ti agbegbe pupọ ti a ṣe.
They are high.	Wọn ga.
I am not.	Nko je e.
I can't change.	Nko le yipada.
I know it won’t drop.	Mo mọ pe ko ni ju silẹ.
The water is full.	Omi naa kun.
Or maybe you.	Tabi o ṣee ṣe iwọ.
I went for a while.	Mo ti lọ fun igba diẹ.
It’s not anything of the sort.	Kii ṣe ohunkohun ti iru.
You have to get out of here.	O ni lati jade kuro ni ibi.
I went into this thing not knowing what this game is.	Mo lọ sinu nkan yii ko mọ kini ere yii jẹ.
As well as it can be.	Bi daradara bi o ti le jẹ.
His eyes saw nothing.	Oju re ko ri nkankan.
His love life, of course, is not well understood.	Igbesi aye ifẹ rẹ, ti eyikeyi, ko loye daradara.
In the year the program was built.	Ni ọdun ti a kọ eto naa.
Often the best stories are those with children.	Nigbagbogbo awọn itan ti o dara julọ jẹ awọn ti o ni awọn ọmọde.
We do not think so.	A ko ronu eyi.
They can be problematic at any temperature.	Wọn le jẹ iṣoro ni eyikeyi awọn omi otutu.
The city is broken.	Ilu ti fọ.
So he is coming back.	Nitorina o n pada wa.
You said nothing.	O ko so nkankan.
For my part, it could not have worked better itself.	Fun idi mi, ko le ti ṣiṣẹ funrararẹ dara julọ.
It gives a little.	O fun ni diẹ.
No one deserves that.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o tọ si iyẹn.
Highways cross a river.	Awọn ọna oju opopona kọja odo kan.
Which is a little more than anything.	Eyi ti o jẹ diẹ diẹ sii ju ohunkohun lọ.
You can't see what we saw.	O ko le ri ohun ti a ri.
That doesn’t make any sense.	Iyẹn ko ṣe ori eyikeyi.
Most people leave early in the morning.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan lọ ni kutukutu owurọ.
And the fact that my work was picked up.	Ati otitọ pe iṣẹ mi ni wọn ti gbe soke.
Make some money from it at least.	Ṣe owo diẹ ninu rẹ ni o kere ju.
It should tell you a story.	O yẹ ki o sọ itan kan fun ọ.
I have to go out.	Mo ni lati jade.
We will do the same.	A yoo ṣe kanna.
The police stopped the speeding car.	Ọlọpa naa da ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o n yara duro.
It can be at any time of day.	O le wa ni eyikeyi akoko ti ọjọ.
He made the deal.	O ṣe adehun naa.
Here it comes.	Nibi o ti de.
I saw my father's money in this.	Mo ri owo baba mi ninu eyi.
But, for a few minutes, he left me.	Ṣugbọn, fun iṣẹju diẹ, o ti fi mi silẹ.
I just left it to him.	Mo kan fi silẹ fun u.
Your child needs help.	Ọmọ rẹ nilo iranlọwọ.
You have power, not them.	O ni agbara, kii ṣe wọn.
That hurts so much!	Iyẹn ṣe ipalara pupọ!
But this is over.	Ṣugbọn eyi kọja.
At least it's gone.	O kere ju o ti lọ.
This is me!	Emi ni yi!
You have no idea that is not yours.	O ko ni ero ti kii ṣe tirẹ.
Maybe you can think of something ?.	Boya o le ronu nkan kan?.
I don't know where we got that.	Emi ko mọ ibiti a ti gba iyẹn.
Some people wear costumes.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan wọ aṣọ ori iye.
And for no contact to you.	Ati fun ko kan si o.
Let it end.	Jẹ ki o pari.
I bought.	Mo ti ra.
We can leave you.	A le fi ọ silẹ.
He didn’t want to leave his car there.	Ko fẹ lati lọ kuro ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ nibẹ.
I do not say another word.	Emi ko sọ ọrọ miiran.
I'm glad it's over.	Inu mi dun pe o ti pari.
The game is lost again!	Ere naa ti padanu lẹẹkansi!
But a lot of things happen that should never happen.	Ṣugbọn ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan ṣẹlẹ ti ko yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
It was not fun.	O je ko fun.
You can’t believe it’s past.	O ko le gbagbọ pe o ti kọja.
Here it is.	Eyi ni.
She was the only girl on the team.	O jẹ ọmọbirin nikan ni ẹgbẹ naa.
It's great.	O dara julọ.
This is my life to make myself at home.	Eyi ni aye mi lati ṣe ara mi ni ile.
It always helps my heart.	Nigbagbogbo o ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọkan mi.
This building has offices, shops, and restaurants.	Ile yii ni awọn ọfiisi, awọn ile itaja, ati awọn ile ounjẹ.
The week will be good for many.	Ọsẹ naa yoo dara fun ọpọlọpọ.
I'll try tomorrow.	Emi yoo gbiyanju ni ọla.
Better without it.	Dara julọ laisi rẹ.
It's too late to go back to school.	O pẹ lati ile-iwe pada.
It’s kind of about everything.	O jẹ iru nipa ohun gbogbo.
Parents too should learn about nutrition.	Awọn obi paapaa yẹ ki o kọ ẹkọ nipa ounjẹ.
They want to leave the site alone.	Wọn fẹ lati lọ kuro ni aaye nikan.
I can't see how it could have moved.	Emi ko le rii bi o ṣe le ti gbe.
That it was time.	Wipe o to akoko.
Only you, the parent, can.	Iwọ nikan, obi, le.
He could not sit for long.	Ko le joko fun igba pipẹ.
Okay, we'll try in your own way.	O dara, a yoo gbiyanju ni ọna tirẹ.
You want it to live one day at a time.	O fẹ ki o gbe ni ọjọ kan ni akoko kan.
But you have heard it here.	Ṣugbọn o ti gbọ nibi.
You can play.	O le mu ṣiṣẹ.
I know you can, but it is something we have to do.	Mo mọ pe o le, ṣugbọn o jẹ ohun ti a ni lati ṣe.
You are in a school.	O wa ni ile-iwe kan.
No one can read what calls their decision or something.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o le ka ohun ti o pe ipinnu wọn tabi nkankan.
We had two other ones there.	A ni meji miiran ti o wà nibẹ.
Live games.	Ngbe awọn ere.
A hard working life has paid off.	Igbesi aye iṣẹ lile ti san.
Sit on a football.	Joko lori bọọlu kan.
Do not harm yourself for any reason.	Maṣe ba ara rẹ jẹ fun eyikeyi idi.
When you see your reason, you have to do it.	Nigbati o ba ri idi rẹ, o ni lati ṣe.
The work is a journey.	Iṣẹ naa jẹ irin-ajo pupọ.
The first thing is to look around yourself.	Ohun akọkọ ni lati wo ni ayika ara rẹ.
This is pretty amazing.	Eyi lẹwa iyalẹnu.
But we understand very little.	Sugbon a loye gan kekere.
I have much to think about.	Mo ni Elo lati ro lori.
He could not think of calling the police or even leaving the house.	Ko le ronu lati pe ọlọpa tabi paapaa lọ kuro ni ile.
The problem is how.	Iṣoro naa jẹ bawo ni.
Nothing happened to him.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si i.
We will try it.	A yoo gbiyanju o.
Don't pay more than that.	Maṣe san diẹ sii ju eyi lọ.
Students.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe .
By some miracle, he was alive.	Nipa iṣẹ iyanu diẹ, o wa laaye.
In the water, it is.	Ninu omi, o jẹ.
First, they are together.	Ni akọkọ, wọn wa papọ.
Have to help.	Ni lati ran.
What to do?	Kini lati ṣe?
We are part of it all.	A jẹ ara wa ti gbogbo.
He is also here.	O tun wa nibi.
They can’t do any good work.	Wọn ko le ṣe eyikeyi iṣẹ daradara.
This is not a way to run a program.	Eyi kii ṣe ọna lati ṣiṣe eto kan.
The meal, like this, is over.	Ounjẹ naa, bii eyi, ti pari.
I look at everything.	Mo wo ohun gbogbo.
The story is over.	Iwe itan ti pari.
If it works, great.	Ti o ba ṣiṣẹ, nla.
It was the most amazing thing.	O jẹ ohun iyalẹnu julọ.
No one knows who they are, or what they do.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ ẹni ti wọn jẹ, tabi kini wọn ṣe.
She looks even more like him, with her hair like that.	O dabi rẹ paapaa diẹ sii, pẹlu irun rẹ bi iyẹn.
Okay, of course you will.	O dara, dajudaju o yoo.
Others are all wrong.	Awọn miiran ni gbogbo aṣiṣe.
In some ways relevant.	Ni diẹ ninu awọn ọna ti o yẹ.
One of us, right now.	Ọkan ninu wa, ni bayi.
We will only see something like this.	A yoo rii nkan bii eyi nikan.
You do not have much future ahead of you.	Iwọ ko ni ọjọ iwaju pupọ ni iwaju rẹ.
Place your hands on your head.	Gbe ọwọ rẹ le ori rẹ.
We may have lost that boy.	A ti le padanu ọmọkunrin yẹn.
I miss him every day.	Mo padanu rẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
They do not know what it is.	Wọn ko mọ kini o jẹ.
Just look.	O kan wo.
He looked back at her.	O wo pada si i.
You know where your hand needs to be.	O mọ ibi ti ọwọ rẹ nilo lati wa.

Continue!	Tẹsiwaju!
We return to school today.	A pada si ile-iwe loni.
I think this will help him a lot.	Mo ro pe eyi yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun u pupọ.
But that all is nothing.	Ṣugbọn pe gbogbo nkan ko jẹ nkankan.
Not intended to.	Ko ti pinnu lati.
They will love it, but they love to love it.	Wọn yoo nifẹ rẹ, ṣugbọn wọn nifẹ lati nifẹ.
But you can deal with the money.	Ṣugbọn o le ṣe pẹlu owo naa.
It just gives you a way to do that.	O kan fun ọ ni ọna lati ṣe iyẹn.
If you kill yourself, your life is over.	Ti o ba pa ara rẹ, igbesi aye rẹ ti pari.
But it has a point.	Ṣugbọn o ni aaye kan.
There is a reason.	Idi kan wa.
Let's get it to bed.	Jẹ ká gba o si ibusun.
Tell him whatever you think most.	Sọ fun u ohunkohun ti o ro julọ.
He very much hoped that his eyes would never leave him.	O nireti pupọ pe oju rẹ ko ni fi oun silẹ.
It was interesting.	O je awon.
Call if you have anything else you need.	Pe ti o ba wa ohunkohun miiran ti o nilo.
And they will never meet again.	Ati awọn ti wọn yoo ko pade lẹẹkansi.
Life is on the horizon.	Aye wa lori akiyesi.
A story needs truth.	Itan kan nilo otitọ.
It means what sounds like it means.	O tumọ si ohun ti o dun bi o tumọ si.
So he used force.	Nitorina o lo agbara.
Maybe you do not understand this.	Boya o ko ni loye eyi.
He stands to reason that this would be true.	O duro lati ro pe eyi yoo jẹ otitọ.
I am very happy for myself.	Inu mi dun pupọ fun ara mi.
High mountains can be seen on the summit.	Awọn oke giga ni a le rii lori ipade.
It was early in the morning to be angry.	O jẹ kutukutu owurọ lati binu.
The more you do, the better you will get.	Bi o ṣe n ṣe diẹ sii, yoo dara julọ ti o gba ni.
I learned early to read on anything.	Mo kọ ẹkọ ni kutukutu lati ka lori ohunkohun.
She lives with her mother.	O ngbe pẹlu iya rẹ.
She was bad with her legs, but her heart was completely fine.	O jẹ buburu pẹlu ẹsẹ rẹ, ṣugbọn ọkan rẹ dara patapata.
And he is still with me.	Ati pe o tun wa pẹlu mi.
No one ever did.	Ko si ẹnikan lailai ṣe.
We do not need more of that.	A ko nilo diẹ sii ti iyẹn.
Today he did something he had never done before.	Loni o ṣe nkan ti ko ṣe tẹlẹ.
Maybe let’s move this to the side.	Boya jẹ ki a gbe eyi si ẹgbẹ.
As soon as he arrived he stopped.	Bi o ti de e lo duro.
But they are not talking about that now.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko sọrọ nipa iyẹn ni bayi.
That can be very stressful.	Iyẹn le fa wahala pupọ.
Most games can’t.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ere ko le.
She is a worthy girl.	O jẹ ọmọbirin ti o yẹ.
And rain.	Ati ojo.
Have you heard anything about it?	Njẹ o ti gbọ ohunkohun nipa rẹ?
I have seen this.	Mo ti ri eyi.
That has to mean something.	Iyẹn ni lati tumọ si nkankan.
I was in a car accident.	Mo wa ninu ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
I am very angry.	Mo binu pupọ.
No one spoke.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọrọ.
Our eyes close on each other.	Oju wa pa ara wa.
I will not look.	Emi kii yoo wo.
In the last few years, that has changed.	Ni awọn ọdun diẹ sẹhin, iyẹn ti yipada.
He asked her.	O beere lọwọ rẹ.
These are my favorites.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn ayanfẹ mi.
No one did that.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe bẹ.
You do, you know.	O ṣe, o mọ.
Tell yourself you do not like the food.	Sọ fun ara rẹ pe o ko fẹ ounjẹ naa.
This is no small matter.	Eyi kii ṣe ọrọ kekere.
I locked myself out of the house.	Mo ti ara mi pa kuro ninu ile.
Clean your mouth.	Mọ ẹnu rẹ.
Hopefully, you plan for the next three days.	A nireti, o gbero fun ọjọ mẹta ti nbọ.
At least we have something to say at the moment.	O kere ju a ni nkan lati sọ ni akoko yii.
The brother was like a machine.	Arakunrin naa dabi ẹrọ.
I wish the summer would come.	Mo fẹ awọn ooru yoo wa.
All these words seem impossible to me.	Gbogbo awọn ọrọ wọnyi dabi ẹni pe ko ṣeeṣe fun mi.
I know why he came.	Mo mọ idi ti o fi wa.

Many of them are easy to find.	Pupọ ninu wọn rọrun lati wa.
Well worth the money.	Daradara tọ awọn owo.
She’s sure she’s waiting for you and she’s fine.	O ni idaniloju pe o n duro de rẹ ati pe o dara.
People have to be on.	Awọn eniyan ni lati wa lori.
We are also good friends.	A tun jẹ ọrẹ to dara.
I can't do it.	Nko le se e.
A family can be very important to a person.	Idile kan le ṣe pataki pupọ fun eniyan.
But no, not to eat.	Ṣugbọn rara, kii ṣe lati jẹ.
Nothing to see here.	Ko si nkankan lati ri nibi.
The children took a picture.	Awọn ọmọde ti ya aworan kan.
Such is the situation.	Iru ipo wa bayi.
But we will be together soon.	Ṣugbọn a yoo wa papọ laipẹ.
My friends are good.	Awọn ọrẹ mi dara.
But they think they are working too hard or too important.	Ṣugbọn wọn ro pe wọn n ṣiṣẹ pupọ tabi ṣe pataki ju.
The game should be for truth.	O yẹ ki ere wa fun otitọ.
Maybe you remember it.	Boya o ranti rẹ.
We enjoyed a delicious meal at a restaurant.	A gbadun ounjẹ ti o dun ni ile ounjẹ kan.
Just wrong.	O kan ko tọ si.
He said my name.	O sọ orukọ mi.
Could not enough.	Ko le to.
Wear yourself, you say.	Wọ ara rẹ, o sọ.
I went back a little bit.	Mo ti sẹhin diẹ diẹ.

I haven’t felt better in years.	Emi ko ni rilara dara julọ ni awọn ọdun.
I do not hear them make love.	Emi ko gbọ wọn ṣe ifẹ.
However, this is a very external world.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi jẹ aye ita pupọ.
I can’t explain any better than that.	Emi ko le ṣe alaye eyikeyi ti o dara ju iyẹn lọ.
It can be amazing.	O le jẹ iyanu.
You can't help but feel good about it.	O ko le ran sugbon lero ti o dara nipa ti o.
I see life in terms of value.	Mo ri aye ni awọn ofin ti iye.
At the moment there is no place to go.	Ni akoko ko si aaye lati lọ.
Whatever you want to do.	Ohunkohun ti o fẹ ṣe.
You are on vacation.	O wa ni oke isinmi.
No, he stopped.	Rara, o duro.
Let’s see if we can do this job.	Jẹ ki a rii boya a le ṣe iṣẹ yii.
I try to get the best out of people.	Mo gbiyanju lati gba awọn ti o dara ju ninu awọn eniyan.
Everyone will have the same conditions.	Ẹnikẹni yoo ni awọn ipo kanna.
Go outside.	Lọ si ita.
We think nothing will change forever.	A ro pe ko si ohun ti yoo yipada lailai.
That ends tomorrow.	Iyẹn pari ni ọla.
And that will not be easy.	Ati pe iyẹn kii yoo rọrun.
And if you are, please let me know.	Ati pe ti o ba wa, jọwọ jẹ ki mi mọ.
I came out.	Mo wa jade.
I know you lost my dad, too.	Mo mọ pe o padanu baba mi, paapaa.
It is a legal act.	O jẹ iṣẹ ofin.
That is what life does for us sometimes.	Iyẹn ni igbesi aye ṣe si wa nigba miiran.

We need to find places for everyone to stay.	A nilo lati wa awọn aaye fun gbogbo eniyan lati duro.

I have played in a few.	Mo ti dun ni kan diẹ.
I'm sorry, he thought.	Mo n binu, o ro.
And, my friends, it is.	Ati pe, awọn ọrẹ mi, o jẹ.
For that reason, you have a lot of money on hand.	Fun idi yẹn, o ni ọpọlọpọ owo ni ọwọ.
That is love.	Iyẹn ni ifẹ jẹ.
He will plan.	Oun yoo gbero.
And there are reasons.	Ati pe awọn idi wa.
If anything makes it more important.	Ti ohunkohun ba jẹ ki o ṣe pataki diẹ sii.
That is what we are talking about.	Ohun ti a n so niyen.
Don't wait, do it now.	Maṣe duro, ṣe ni bayi.
So you can start making one.	Nitorina o le bẹrẹ ṣiṣe ọkan.
All is well, until the last week of the month.	Gbogbo rẹ dara, titi di ọsẹ ti o kẹhin ti oṣu naa.
And they love it.	Ati pe wọn nifẹ rẹ.
But it turns out to be.	Sugbon ki o wa ni jade lati wa ni.
I do not want to let it go.	Emi ko fẹ lati jẹ ki o lọ.
He sold me.	O ta mi.
The buildings are two or three storeys high.	Awọn ile jẹ giga meji tabi mẹta.
Ask yourself what you do not want to ask.	Beere lọwọ ararẹ kini o ko fẹ lati beere.
Some of these women are doctors.	Diẹ ninu awọn obinrin wọnyi jẹ dokita.
We are expecting another child.	A n reti lati bi ọmọ miiran.
So after dinner go to bed.	Nitorina lẹhin ounjẹ alẹ si ibusun.
And once you are there will wait for dinner.	Ati ni kete ti o ba wa nibẹ yoo duro fun ounjẹ alẹ.
I try to live this time.	Mo gbiyanju lati gbe ni akoko yii.
We do not have to wait for anyone.	A ko ni lati duro fun ẹnikẹni.
People go through.	Eniyan lọ nipasẹ.
You should return your money.	O yẹ ki o da owo rẹ pada.
That person laughed.	Ẹni yẹn rẹrin.
Understanding what they went through is hard.	Oye ohun ti wọn ti kọja jẹ lile.
Time does that.	Akoko ṣe iyẹn.
They can leave.	Wọn le lọ kuro.
The thing will not be stopped.	A ko ni da nkan naa duro.
Of the door.	Ti ilẹkun.
All of this is a fair game, they think.	Gbogbo eyi jẹ ere ti o tọ, wọn ro.
You like it.	O fẹran rẹ.
Look around you and ask them what they need.	Wo agbegbe rẹ ki o beere lọwọ wọn ohun ti wọn nilo.
You love it, you know.	O nifẹ rẹ, o mọ.
And it was great, you know.	Ati pe o jẹ nla, o mọ.
So that's your idea.	Nitorina imọran rẹ niyẹn.
I told them not to feel any special way.	Mo sọ fun wọn pe ko rilara eyikeyi ọna pataki.
He did not pull away.	O ko fa kuro.
But not others.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe awọn miiran.
He wrote it down for the time being.	O kọ ọ silẹ fun akoko naa.
She loves to plan.	O nifẹ lati gbero.
This guy seems to be in trouble.	Arakunrin yii dabi wahala.
He had a book with him, but did not open it.	O ni iwe kan pẹlu rẹ, ṣugbọn ko ṣi i.
I could not understand how it turned out to be special.	Emi ko le loye bi o ṣe yipada si pataki.
It is not a matter of art.	Kii ṣe ọrọ ti aworan.
I have time to think about it.	Mo ni akoko lati ronu nipa rẹ.
This is new.	Eyi jẹ tuntun.
You believe, so they believe.	O gbagbọ, nitorina wọn gbagbọ.
It will not seem possible at first.	O yoo ko dabi ṣee ṣe ni akọkọ.
Love you, girl.	Nifẹ rẹ, ọmọbirin.
This is an important issue for the reasons given below.	Eyi jẹ ọrọ pataki fun awọn idi ti a fun ni isalẹ.
Okay, because of you.	O dara, nitori rẹ ni.
Do not rush to write down what they call you.	Maṣe yara lati kọ ohun ti wọn pe ọ silẹ.
Look at that picture again, do you?	Tun wo aworan yẹn, ṣe iwọ?
He looked inside her.	O wo inu rẹ.
I pay attention.	Mo san akiyesi.
It could not have been better.	Ko le ti dara julọ.
We believe they are.	A gbagbọ pe wọn jẹ.
We know it is important.	A mọ pe o jẹ pataki.
That is a matter of course.	Iyẹn jẹ ọrọ dajudaju.
We do not know.	A ko mọ ọ.
None of us would take the house.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa ti yoo gba ile naa.
Is this possible?	Njẹ eyi le ṣee ṣe dara julọ.
When lunch was over he turned and left.	Nigbati ounjẹ ọsan ba pari o yipada o si lọ.
I'm sure you know these things.	Mo daju pe o mọ nkan wọnyi.
Can you know who you are.	Ṣe o le mọ pe iwọ jẹ tani.
They will not go.	Wọn kii yoo lọ.
Just make sure to tell him it’s okay.	O kan rii daju lati sọ fun u pe o dara.
He opened the newspaper.	O ṣii iwe iroyin naa.
They laughed at each other, and with each other.	Wọn rẹrin si ara wọn, ati pẹlu ara wọn.
Hold my hand.	Di ọwọ mi mu.
We have done a lot more.	A ti ṣe pupọ diẹ.
I have no time for myself.	Emi ko ni akoko kan si ara mi.
He seems to like it.	O dabi pe o fẹran rẹ.
I have many books.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe.
But that is a good idea.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ imọran to dara.
And it's over.	Ati pe o wa lori.
We know what they did.	A mọ ohun ti wọn ṣe.

You have to go to school every day.	O ni lati lọ si ile-iwe ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Every day more and more names are called.	Ni gbogbo ọjọ diẹ diẹ sii awọn orukọ ti a pe.
Just pick it up.	O kan gbe o.
But you can say that he did not feel like himself.	Ṣugbọn o le sọ pe ko rilara bi ara rẹ.
Not available.	Ko si.
He changed the game.	O yipada ere naa.
He has grown for his age.	O ti dagba fun ọjọ ori rẹ.

Sorry to say that, but it's true.	Ma binu lati sọ iyẹn, ṣugbọn otitọ ni.
You will not change.	Iwọ kii yoo yipada.
The issue is that we do not have enough water.	Ọrọ naa ni pe a ko ni omi to.
Okay, sorry for them.	O dara, o binu fun wọn.

They said it could not be done, but our father did it.	Won ni ko le se, sugbon baba wa se e.
But this is not the day.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe ọjọ yẹn.
One of the three trials appeared.	Ọkan ninu awọn idanwo mẹta ti o han.
She was worried about it.	O ṣe aniyan nipa rẹ.

After a while the truck stopped.	Lẹhin igba diẹ ọkọ nla naa duro.
Nothing ever made him feel good.	Ko si ohun ti o lailai ṣe fun u lero wipe o dara.

Even a child cannot speak now.	Ọmọde paapaa ko le sọrọ ni bayi.
He closed his eyes, just for a minute.	O pa oju rẹ mọ, o kan fun iṣẹju kan.
I can work with that.	Mo le ṣiṣẹ pẹlu iyẹn.

Some ideas are good, while some are not so good.	Diẹ ninu awọn imọran dara, nigba ti diẹ ninu ko dara bẹ.

I will not give you any information.	Emi kii yoo fun ọ ni alaye eyikeyi.
If he was only here, if he is now, he would tell the truth.	Ti o ba jẹ nibi nikan, ti o ba jẹ bayi, oun yoo sọ otitọ.
You know, they are on our side.	O mọ, wọn wa ni ẹgbẹ wa.
At the time, it looked great.	Ni akoko yẹn, o dabi ohun nla.
I feel good.	Mo lero dara.
It doesn't matter to me.	Ko ṣe pataki fun mi.
They will have to go for that.	Wọn yoo ni lati lọ si iyẹn.
The sister was fine with it.	Arabinrin naa dara pẹlu rẹ.
It was an inside one for me.	O jẹ ọkan ti inu fun mi.
He has lived in the big city all his life.	O ti gbe ni ilu nla ni gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ.
But before long it does not matter much.	Ṣugbọn ṣaaju ki o to gun ko ṣe pataki pupọ.
We know our strengths.	A mọ awọn agbara wa.
I just hope it will be done.	Mo kan nireti pe yoo ṣee ṣe.
There are, what brings him to us.	Nibẹ ni o wa, ohun ti o mu u fun wa.
The human body.	Ara eniyan.
So remove it.	Nitorina yọ kuro.
You think you know one.	O ro pe o mọ ọkan.
Suffice it to say, it started.	O to bi lati sọ, o bẹrẹ.
This name alone speaks volumes.	Orukọ yii nikan sọrọ pupọ.
We went to visit a friend.	A lọ ṣabẹwo si ọrẹ kan.
The question is what else can they try.	Ibeere naa ni kini ohun miiran ti wọn le gbiyanju.
And you can not do anything with this.	Ati pe o ko le ṣe ohunkohun pẹlu eyi.
You have to hold on to yourself, before you give up everything.	O ni lati di ara rẹ mu, ṣaaju ki o to fi ohun gbogbo silẹ.
I do not know where I started.	Emi ko mọ ibiti mo ti bẹrẹ.
See port, there.	Wo ibudo, nibẹ.
We are in the same class at school.	A wa ni kilasi kanna ni ile-iwe.
Do not remove water.	Maṣe yọ omi kuro.
They can’t do enough for you.	Wọn ko le ṣe to fun ọ.
He is very angry.	O binu gidigidi.
The project requires some skill	Iṣẹ naa nilo ọgbọn diẹ
It happens that people come back together.	O ṣẹlẹ pe awọn eniyan pada papọ.
He decided to take it in stride.	O pinnu lati mu u ni ọrọ rẹ.
Every hour is full of wonder and wonder.	Gbogbo wakati ni o kun fun iyalẹnu ati iyalẹnu.
I can live without that.	Mo le gbe laisi iyẹn.
But you know that already.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe tẹlẹ.
They did not go.	Wọn ko lọ.
He dropped it.	O sọ ọ silẹ.
Take that hand off!	Mu ọwọ yẹn kuro!
We have electricity.	A ni agbara ina.
But they are not on your own.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko si lori ara rẹ.
Do it for me.	Ṣe o fun mi.
Doing what you want.	Ṣiṣe ohun ti o fẹ.
This thing really doesn’t get it.	Nkan yi gan ko gba o.
Does the child look like this?	Njẹ ọmọ naa rii bi eleyi?
I can't believe it.	Emi ko le gbagbọ.
We take this very seriously.	A n mu eyi ni pataki.
What a great company.	Kini ile-iṣẹ nla kan.
Not been there.	Ti ko ti wa nibẹ.
You mostly keep to yourself.	O julọ pa ara rẹ mọ.
People always like food to fast.	Awọn eniyan nigbagbogbo fẹran ounjẹ lati yara.
Tough decisions must be made.	Awọn ipinnu ti o nira gbọdọ ṣe.
If you think you have what it takes.	Ti o ba ro pe o ni ohun ti o gba.
My sister is having a big party.	Arabinrin mi n ṣe ayẹyẹ nla kan.
Bring your questions.	Mu awọn ibeere rẹ wa.
I can't change.	Mi o le yipada.
This will be my last word.	Eyi yoo jẹ ọrọ ikẹhin mi.
I know myself very high about my voice.	Mo mọ ara mi ga julọ nipa ohun mi.
It is a very important situation.	O jẹ ipo ti o ṣe pataki pupọ.
Most of them know about the program.	Pupọ ninu wọn mọ nipa eto naa.
No one will notice.	Ko si ọkan yoo ṣe akiyesi.
He did not try to eat.	Ko gbiyanju lati jẹ.
Sometimes, you just stop talking.	Nigba miiran, o kan da sọrọ.
Just not in it.	O kan ko si ninu rẹ.
I can't think of any way to make it work.	Emi ko le ro ero eyikeyi ọna lati jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
Even in your heart.	Paapaa inu ọkan rẹ.
More to come soon.	Diẹ sii lati wa laipẹ.
Do whatever you have to.	Ṣe ohunkohun ti o ni lati.
They may not be sure of what they know.	Wọn le ma ni idaniloju ohun ti wọn mọ.
Some community members were not happy with the decision.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ agbegbe ko dun si ipinnu naa.
Do it well again.	Ṣe o dara lẹẹkansi.
She went out to give him a room.	O jade lọ lati fun u ni yara.
There is no place to even live.	Ko si aye kan lati paapaa gbe.
Just get it.	O kan gba.
Not much to lose drinking, either.	Ko Elo padanu mimu, boya.
There is something bad about it.	Ohun buburu kan lo wa nipa rẹ.
None of the trees looked great either.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn igi ti o dabi nla paapaa.
I can run that in under a minute.	Mo le ṣiṣe iyẹn ni labẹ iṣẹju kan.
However it is wrong.	Sibẹsibẹ o jẹ aṣiṣe.
Tell him to keep to his side.	Sọ fun u lati tọju si ẹgbẹ rẹ.
Everyone is on high.	Gbogbo eniyan wa lori giga.
Thus, it is important that you do not show your hand too soon.	Bayi, o ṣe pataki ki o maṣe fi ọwọ rẹ han laipẹ.
I can read in your eyes.	Mo le ka ni oju rẹ.
I hope you get the love of running even.	Mo nireti pe o gba ifẹ ti ṣiṣe paapaa.
She anxiously looked at her watch.	O fi aniyan wo aago rẹ.
With no time limit.	Pẹlu ko si akoko iye to.
Your brother will.	Arakunrin rẹ yoo.
The dog is not allowed inside.	Aja ko gba laaye ninu.
It hasn't killed me yet.	Ko tii pa mi sibẹsibẹ.
These let you plan and test on the road.	Awọn wọnyi jẹ ki o ṣe eto ati idanwo ni opopona.
That's what the team is doing.	Ohun ti ẹgbẹ n ṣe niyẹn.
It is very important to them.	O ṣe pataki pupọ fun wọn.
He did not take his eyes off the side.	Ko mu oju rẹ kuro ni ẹgbẹ naa.
Start from the top, work your way down.	Bẹrẹ lati oke, ṣiṣẹ ọna rẹ si isalẹ.
He didn't want that at all.	Ko fe iyẹn rara.
You have a reason.	O ni idi.
How long they think you can continue for.	Bawo ni pipẹ ti wọn ro pe o le tẹsiwaju fun.
Few even know his face or name.	Diẹ paapaa mọ oju tabi orukọ rẹ.
I have more than enough.	Mo ni diẹ sii ju to.
He stopped to go to class.	O duro lati lọ si kilasi.
He headed towards the room.	O ya si ọna yara naa.
So we missed a few letters.	Nitorina a padanu awọn lẹta diẹ.
The cars are very fast, you can see them going.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa yara pupọ, o le rii wọn lọ.
Well, it’s not just their thing.	O dara, kii ṣe nkan wọn nikan.
Sorry, everyone, you think.	Ma binu, gbogbo eniyan, o ro.
It will always be.	Yoo ma jẹ nigbagbogbo.
You get in the way.	O gba ni ọna.
Your life is over.	Aye re ti pari.
The program like most of.	Eto naa bi ọpọlọpọ ninu.
But no, he did not make such a suggestion at all.	Ṣugbọn rara, ko ṣe iru imọran bẹẹ rara.
I can't forget it.	Nko le gbagbe re.
I mean, always.	Mo tumọ si, nigbagbogbo.
It convinced me, at least.	O ti da mi loju, o kere ju.
This task is simple enough.	Iṣẹ yi rọrun to.
And they don’t want to hear yours, either.	Ati pe wọn ko fẹ lati gbọ tirẹ, boya.
He wants people.	O fe eniyan.
It’s stronger and all over again.	O ni okun sii ati gbogbo lẹẹkansi.
Such work is not handy at this time.	Iru iṣẹ bẹẹ ko ni ọwọ ni akoko yii.
Just for what you can.	O kan fun ohun ti o le.
Of course they can’t.	Dajudaju wọn ko le ṣe.
You know that already.	O mọ pe tẹlẹ.
I have not yet added any device other than those two.	Mo ti ko sibẹsibẹ fi kun eyikeyi ẹrọ miiran ju awon meji.
That has made me into a bad person.	Ti o ti ṣe mi sinu buburu eniyan.
But they can not.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko le.
I went to the party.	Mo lọ si ibi ti ayẹyẹ naa wa.
We cannot let this happen, not now.	A ko le jẹ ki eyi ṣẹlẹ, kii ṣe ni bayi.
Don't wait too long.	Maṣe duro pẹ ju.
You think they need it.	O ro pe wọn nilo rẹ.
You’re talking to someone.	O n ba ẹnikan sọrọ.
What should we wear people ?.	Kini o yẹ ki a wọ awọn eniyan ?.
It is on the news.	O wa lori iroyin.
Our children are good.	Awọn ọmọ wa dara.
It is very surprising.	O jẹ iyalẹnu pupọ.
If you do not know, ask.	Ti o ko ba mọ, beere.
How is this possible?	Bawo ni eyi ṣe ṣee ṣe?
She read it and it was amazing.	O ka ati pe o jẹ iyalẹnu.
The word stopped, and everyone turned to look at me.	Ọrọ naa duro, gbogbo eniyan si yipada lati wo mi.
How right.	Bawo ni o ṣe tọ.
And we have to tell the truth to people, as we have seen.	Ati pe a ni lati sọ otitọ fun eniyan, bi a ti rii.
However he could not move it.	Sibẹsibẹ ko le gbe e.
It is a place to meet your friends.	O jẹ aaye lati pade awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
It is important to me.	O ṣe pataki fun mi.
It was not.	O je ko.
I will not do so.	Emi kii yoo ṣe bẹ bẹ.
Not awake yet.	Ko ji sibẹsibẹ.
Not everyone has the power of one.	Kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan ti o ni agbara ti ọkan.
But something was very serious.	Sugbon nkankan je gidigidi.
I looked up again, and nothing.	Mo tun wo soke, ko si si nkankan.
I hope to rush into it,.	Mo nireti lati sare wọ inu rẹ,.
He will look like he is.	Oun yoo wo bi o ti ri.
But he can't move it.	Sugbon ko le gbe o.
But what you may not realize is that they are there for a reason.	Ṣugbọn ohun ti o le ma mọ ni pe wọn wa nibẹ fun idi kan.
Open your eyes and start with what you see.	Ṣii oju rẹ ki o bẹrẹ pẹlu ohun ti o rii.
You don’t need this to happen to you.	O ko nilo eyi lati ṣẹlẹ fun ọ.
It has been great.	O ti jẹ nla.
I'm happy to have.	Inu mi dun lati ni.
The lessons went well.	Awọn ẹkọ lọ daradara.
They want you to be afraid.	Wọn fẹ ki o bẹru.
Bring back through.	Mu pada nipasẹ.
But this is not too long.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe gun ju.
He said he thought they could get a car.	O sọ pe o ro pe wọn le gba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
He has a lot of friends.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ.
Have you worked with this device before?	Njẹ o ti ṣiṣẹ pẹlu ẹrọ yii tẹlẹ?
I get that.	Mo gba iyẹn.
Any day now you will hear from them.	Eyikeyi ọjọ bayi o yoo gbọ lati wọn.
We may be too late.	A le pẹ ju.
But everyone is saying we sold out.	Ṣugbọn gbogbo eniyan n sọ pe a ta jade.
They are the ones who decide.	Awọn ni wọn pinnu.
So he quit the job, and started selling himself.	Nitorina o fi iṣẹ naa silẹ, o si bẹrẹ si ta ara rẹ.
Think something out of it works.	Ronu nkankan jade ti o ṣiṣẹ.
Call me a man.	Pe mi ọkunrin kan.
Maybe you hear me and look back.	Boya o gbọ ti emi ki o si wo ẹhin.
Now you have style.	Bayi ti o ni ara.
It seemed to come from within.	O dabi enipe o wa lati inu.
You want to start.	O fẹ bẹrẹ.
Not bad when everyone expects you to lose.	Ko buburu nigbati gbogbo eniyan reti o lati padanu.
I'm glad to have you.	Inu mi dun lati ni ọ.
I wonder what in fact it was.	Mo Iyanu ohun ni o daju ti o je.
You can meet him there.	O le pade rẹ nibẹ.
Don’t tell me you don’t know how the program works.	Maṣe sọ fun mi pe o ko mọ bi eto naa ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
The man closed the doors open for me.	Ọkunrin naa di awọn ilẹkun ṣi silẹ fun mi.
I know some do.	Mo mọ diẹ ninu awọn ṣe.
Be in your life.	Wa ninu aye re.
I do not want you to marry me.	Nko ni ki e fe mi.
Too well, really.	Ju daradara, ni otitọ.
Some questions, however, require more than that.	Diẹ ninu awọn ibeere, sibẹsibẹ, nilo diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
They did well here.	Wọn ṣe daradara nibi.
Love me, love me, love me.	Fẹ mi, nifẹ mi, nifẹ mi.
People laughed a lot.	Awọn eniyan rẹrin ni imọran pupọ.
I will go get them.	Emi yoo lọ gba wọn.
I can remember when that song came out.	Mo le ranti nigbati orin yẹn jade.
It needs a lot of rest.	O nilo isinmi pupọ.
I want to hear other people doing something.	Mo fẹ lati gbọ awọn eniyan miiran n ṣe nkan.
It can happen again.	O le tun ṣẹlẹ.
I should have helped him become that person underwater.	Emi yẹ ki o ti ṣe iranlọwọ fun u lati di eniyan yẹn labẹ omi.
So you see, you can't leave yet.	Nitorina o rii, o ko le lọ kuro sibẹsibẹ.
It doesn’t happen very often.	O ko ṣẹlẹ gan igba.
Haven't heard from them.	Ti ko ti gbọ lati wọn.
They already know this place, however it already is.	Wọn ti mọ ibi yii tẹlẹ, sibẹsibẹ o jẹ tẹlẹ.
Her clothes are made.	Aṣọ rẹ̀ ni a ṣe.
I'm so good.	Mo wa bẹ iyẹn dara.
Families are available for vacations, or just to visit.	Awọn idile wa fun awọn isinmi, tabi lati ṣabẹwo nikan.
So, you see.	Nitorina, o ri.
I'm sorry for that.	Ma binu fun iyẹn.
I am angry with you.	Mo binu si ọ.
I'm coming here.	Mo n bọ nibi.
I do not know how to leave the body.	Emi ko mọ bi a ṣe le lọ kuro ni ti ara.
They are the face of the future.	Wọn jẹ oju ti ojo iwaju.
I read it and thought it was great.	Mo ti ka o ati ki o ro o je nla.
Here are my promises.	Eyi ni awọn ileri mi.
It is a small problem for most people.	O jẹ iṣoro kekere fun ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
The trip ended in about an hour or so.	Irin-ajo naa ti pari ni bii wakati kan tabi bẹ.
I have become old, he said to himself.	Mo ti di ọjọ ori, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
That's your business.	Iṣẹ rẹ niyẹn.
Both asked for an understanding they did not have.	Awọn mejeeji beere oye ti wọn ko ni.
The beautiful girl wanted a kiss.	Ọmọbirin lẹwa naa fẹ ẹnu kan.
There is no fast spot.	Ko si aaye ti o yara.
Many of us think that is a mistake.	Pupọ wa ro pe aṣiṣe niyẹn.
They will do well.	Wọn yoo ṣe daradara.
They could not find one. 	Wọn ko le ri ọkan. 
And say it again.	Ki o si sọ lẹẹkansi.
You know, how do you feel about that.	O mọ, bawo ni o ṣe rilara nipa iyẹn.
He stood outside the restaurant.	O duro ni ita ile ounjẹ.
That may explain some of these disadvantages.	Iyẹn le ṣe alaye diẹ ninu awọn ipalara wọnyi.
He will not appear.	Oun kii yoo han gbangba.
We take on anyone there.	A ya lori ẹnikẹni ti o wa nibẹ.
Many of them just read.	Pupọ ninu wọn kan ka.
Making great music.	Ṣiṣe orin nla.
We are determined that our company has a wonderful future.	A pinnu pe ile-iṣẹ wa ni ọjọ iwaju iyanu.
Not sure how to proceed.	Ko daju bi o ṣe le tẹsiwaju.
The love is growing.	Ifẹ naa n dagba.
Just ask that it is.	O kan beere pe o jẹ.
He called the station, anxious.	O pe ibudo, aniyan.
And don’t think it’s easy after thirty years.	Ki o si ma ṣe ro pe o rọrun lẹhin ọgbọn ọdun.
That missed the point.	Iyẹn padanu aaye naa.
They are mothers and hate the idea that children go without.	Wọn jẹ iya ati korira ero ti awọn ọmọde lọ laisi.
Can you drop that book?	Ṣe o le fi iwe yẹn silẹ?
He never looked inside.	Ko wo inu re mo.
They will do what they think is right.	Wọn yoo ṣe ohun ti wọn ro pe o tọ.
Never think about it again.	Ko ro nipa o lẹẹkansi.
We were able to repair the car without any trouble.	A ni anfani lati tun ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa ṣe laisi wahala eyikeyi.
Or maybe something depends on it.	Tabi boya ohun kan da lori o.
I will try for that.	Emi yoo gbiyanju fun iyẹn.
Good to be good.	O dara lati dara.
More than a week.	O ju ọsẹ kan lọ.
But then, it was not really removed.	Sugbon ki o si, o ti ko gan kuro.
It makes sense for the facts.	O ni ori fun awọn otitọ.
I want you to have this special gift.	Mo fẹ ki o ni ẹbun pataki yii.
I do not see anything.	Nko ri nkankan.
This is what life is for.	Eyi ni ohun ti igbesi aye jẹ fun.
Made a lot of money too.	Ti ṣe owo pupọ paapaa.
How to cut this space.	Bawo ni o ṣe le ge aaye yii kuro.
I wonder what you think about it.	Mo Iyanu ohun ti o ro nipa o.
You look up from your book.	O wo soke lati iwe rẹ.
He forcefully closed his eyes.	O si fi agbara pa oju rẹ.
For the first time, everyone was able to understand what he was saying.	Fun igba akọkọ, gbogbo eniyan ni anfani lati loye ohun ti o sọ.
The car sped off the road.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o yara naa ya kuro ni opopona.
That is to start.	Iyẹn jẹ lati bẹrẹ.
You could have said more.	O le ti sọ diẹ sii.
I'm happy.	Inu mi dun.
We get it.	A gba o.
The children have not cleaned their room properly.	Awọn ọmọde ko ti nu yara wọn mọ daradara.
Everyone loves it, you see.	Gbogbo eniyan nifẹ rẹ, o rii.
Okay, no help for that.	O dara, ko si iranlọwọ fun iyẹn.
It's easy to do.	O rọrun lati ṣe.
He gives us everything we have.	O fun wa ni ohun gbogbo ti a ni.
It may take some time.	O le gba akoko diẹ.
Her students love it.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe rẹ fẹran rẹ.
If you take this, you are dead.	Ti o ba mu eyi, o ti ku.
We did not.	A ko ṣe bẹ.
Just to have.	O kan lati ni.
You should take a boat with me.	O yẹ ki o mu ọkọ oju omi pẹlu mi.
Many trees grow that way.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn igi dagba ni ọna naa.
The food tastes really good.	Ounjẹ dun dara julọ.
Which he did not want to do, not yet.	Eyi ti ko fẹ ṣe, ko sibẹsibẹ.
There is always a new life behind it.	Igbesi aye tuntun nigbagbogbo wa lẹhin.
He does not know.	Ko mọ.
Write a lot.	Kọ pupọ.
He came to see if that would happen.	O wa lati rii boya iyẹn yoo ṣẹlẹ.
I have never been able to move anything before.	Emi ko ti le gbe ohunkohun ṣaaju ki o to.
I think he would have learned it after that.	Mo ro pe oun yoo ti kọ ẹkọ rẹ lẹhin eyi.
I can't get out.	Emi ko le gba jade.
The project will continue until next year.	Iṣẹ naa yoo wa titi di ọdun ti nbọ.
It looks like the old days.	O dabi awọn akoko atijọ.
Nothing ever happened.	Ko si ohun lailai ṣe.
If they think they are your friends, they will call again.	Ti wọn ba ro pe wọn jẹ ọrẹ rẹ, wọn yoo tun pe.
But people missed it.	Ṣugbọn awọn eniyan padanu rẹ.
We can repeat if we want.	A le tun ṣe ti a ba fẹ.
You have to grow.	O ni lati dagba.
I should not live to this day.	Emi ko yẹ ki n gbe titi di oni.
Therefore, you have agreed that you want to take your place.	Nitorina, o ti gba pe o fẹ gba ipo rẹ.
The boys returned to school yesterday.	Awọn ọmọkunrin naa pada si ile-iwe lana.
It just makes it so.	O kan mu ki o bẹ.
Both have not played football for much of last season.	Awọn mejeeji ko ni bọọlu fun pupọ julọ ni akoko to kọja.
He quickly pulled the book out of his mouth.	O yara yọ iwe naa kuro ni ẹnu rẹ.
These ideas do not work well.	Awọn ero wọnyi ko ṣiṣẹ daradara.
That is.	Iyẹn ni.
It turned out and no one was there.	O yipada ko si si ẹnikan nibẹ.
Everything that matters is here and now.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni ibi ati bayi.
You.	Iwọ.
I enjoyed them for breakfast.	Mo gbadun wọn fun ounjẹ owurọ.
It is one of the best.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ti o dara julọ.
It has good energy.	O ni agbara to dara.
Anything that can be money or value.	Ohunkohun ti o le jẹ owo tabi iye.
Their interest is hard to hold for long.	Wọn anfani jẹ gidigidi lati mu fun gun.
I know you will need me.	Mo mọ pe iwọ yoo nilo mi.
Tomorrow we will pay you.	Ọla a yoo san rẹ.
The time is over.	Awọn akoko ni lori.
But you have made a mistake.	Ṣugbọn o ti ṣe aṣiṣe.
He has put himself in the spotlight.	O ti fi ara rẹ si aaye.
I'll be back there shortly.	Emi yoo pada wa nibẹ ni igba diẹ.
I would think this too.	Emi yoo ronu eyi pẹlu.
I really do.	Emi re gan.
You will understand.	Iwọ yoo loye.
Lots of wonderful friends.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ iyanu.
It does a little big.	O ṣe kekere nla.
Every little bit helps us do what we do.	Gbogbo kekere diẹ ṣe iranlọwọ fun wa lati ṣe ohun ti a ṣe.
People love to read old things.	Eniyan nifẹ lati ka awọn nkan atijọ.
I had a great time.	Mo jẹ akoko nla.
One minute, please!	Jọwọ, iṣẹju kan!
He stopped and sat down.	O duro ati joko.
It will take hours to work.	Yoo gba to wakati lati ṣiṣẹ.
You know there is nothing wrong with that.	O mọ pe ko ṣe aṣiṣe nipa eyi.
The woman's body is beautiful.	Ara obinrin naa dara.
But that doesn’t matter.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe pataki.
You can use either.	O le lo boya.
He was dead, so he could not get out.	O ti ku, nitorina ko le jade.
They were given beds, food and they were sent back to school.	A fun wọn ni ibusun, ounjẹ ati pe wọn pada si ile-iwe.
I hate cats.	Mo korira ologbo.
This can be very difficult for me to do.	Eyi le pupọ fun mi lati ṣe.
I hope it is not you.	Mo nireti pe kii ṣe iwọ.
He ran field football.	O si sare awọn bọọlu aaye.
But it worked well for me.	Ṣugbọn o ṣiṣẹ daradara fun mi.
Just a few more weeks.	O kan diẹ diẹ ọsẹ.
Okay, and it can happen.	Dara, ati pe o le ṣẹlẹ.
You have to understand them.	O ni lati ni oye wọn.
One of them raised his eyes.	Ọkan ninu wọn fa oju rẹ soke.
I saw someone outside.	Mo ti ri ẹnikan ni ita.
Take off your shoes before entering this house.	Yọ bata rẹ kuro ki o to wọ ile yii.
He asked her if she was the father.	O beere lọwọ rẹ boya oun ni baba naa.
The phone also rings.	Foonu tun dun.
If they can do that, they can do anything.	Ti wọn ba le ṣe bẹ, wọn le ṣe ohunkohun.
It sounds sweet.	O dun dun.
I was in the store at the time.	Mo wa ninu ile itaja ni akoko yẹn.
He saw that he was in trouble.	O ri pe o wa ninu wahala.
Can you believe that he created us?	Ṣe o le gbagbọ pe o da wa?
The important thing is that they do.	Ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni pe wọn ṣe.
She was afraid of flying.	O bẹru ti fo.
They can grow while wearing them.	Wọn le dagba nigba ti o wọ wọn.
That has not changed at all.	Iyẹn ko yipada rara.
He was the last to see his mother.	Oun ni o kẹhin lati ri iya rẹ.
To treat me like this is wrong.	Lati tọju mi ​​bii eyi ko tọ.
Others do the same.	Awọn miiran ṣe kanna.
But it is not a concern.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe aniyan.
The sun was hot, and he slept for a while.	Oorun gbona, o si sun fun igba diẹ.
We will not have as much time as we had hoped.	A kii yoo ni akoko pupọ bi a ti nireti.
How much does it cost me?	Elo ni fun mi.
I try to figure out what you would like.	Mo gbiyanju lati ro ohun ti o yoo fẹ.
Start small, see how it goes.	Bẹrẹ kekere, wo bi o ṣe lọ.
He continued to give me a mistake.	O tẹsiwaju fun mi ni aṣiṣe.
And there is one thing you want to change in your life.	Ati pe ohun kan wa ti o fẹ yipada ninu igbesi aye rẹ.
We are also young.	A tun jẹ ọmọde.
He’s one of them, too.	O jẹ ọkan ninu wọn, paapaa.
Police say they did not.	Ọlọpa sọ pe wọn ko ṣe.
I walked to the table and stood by his head.	Mo rin si tabili ati ki o duro nipa ori rẹ.
First, and this is very important to me.	Ni akọkọ, ati pe eyi jẹ pataki julọ fun mi.
And never do this again.	Ati pe maṣe ṣe eyi lẹẹkansi.
You should have seen it.	O yẹ ki o ti ri i.
And it costs a lot of money to travel.	Ati pe o jẹ owo pupọ lati rin irin-ajo.
But that was not his first thought at the time.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe ero akọkọ rẹ ni akoko yẹn.
What a time of love it seemed.	Iru akoko ife ti o dabi enipe.
We are not able to think what is wrong.	A ko ni anfani lati ro ero ohun ti ko tọ.
Just make a simple statement that the situation seems to be working.	Kan ṣe alaye ti o rọrun pe ipo naa dabi iṣẹ ṣiṣe.
I do not want to forget it.	Nko fe gbagbe re.
What a conclusion.	Kini ipari kan.
Read, go meet people, open one and your eyes.	Ka, lọ pade awọn eniyan, ṣii ọkan ati oju rẹ.
And you did not.	Ati pe iwọ ko ṣe bẹ.
They had three children.	Wọn bi ọmọ mẹta.
Sure, let me try that.	Daju, jẹ ki n gbiyanju iyẹn.
I see what you can do.	Mo ti rii ohun ti o le ṣe.
Now is one of those moments.	Bayi jẹ ọkan ninu awọn akoko yẹn.
This should never happen again.	Eyi ko yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
I will find a way.	Emi yoo wa ọna kan.
It seemed much longer.	O dabi enipe Elo to gun.
And to put one in your ear.	Ati lati fi ọkan si eti rẹ.
If you miss it, you miss it forever.	Ti o ba padanu rẹ, o padanu rẹ lailai.
No one is in sight.	Ko si ẹnikan ni oju.
He reached down and grabbed the hair.	O de isalẹ o si di ọwọ irun naa.
You can not change this.	O ko le yi eyi pada.
But he is the same man he is today.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ọkunrin kanna ti o jẹ loni.
I am very happy to be here with you.	Inu mi dun pupọ lati wa nibi pẹlu rẹ.
It was my really good car.	O jẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi ti o dara gaan.
You may hate it.	O le korira rẹ.
Just think if you need to.	Kan ro ti o ba nilo.
Maybe you know and look away, maybe you understand.	Boya o mọ ati ki o wo kuro, boya o loye.
That was easy.	O rọrun yẹn.
I can't drink.	Nko le mu.
Whatever you do.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣe.
All the children in the pictures are boys.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọde ti o wa ninu awọn aworan jẹ ọmọkunrin.
I have been less well known.	Mo ti a ti kere daradara mọ.
Good for me.	O dara fun mi.
It was a weekday.	O jẹ alẹ ọsẹ kan.
Without heads and feet.	Laisi awọn ori ati awọn ẹsẹ.
When he entered the room, all eyes were on him.	Nigbati o wọ inu yara naa, gbogbo oju wa lori rẹ.
Who believes it is good.	Ti o gbagbọ pe o dara.
You know yourself better than anyone.	O mọ ara rẹ dara ju ẹnikẹni lọ.
They have to make decisions, and those who do not, cannot.	Wọn ni lati ṣe awọn ipinnu, ati awọn ti ko ṣe, ko le.
Out there.	Ti jade nibẹ.
The woman will get the truth for him, too.	Obinrin naa yoo gba otitọ fun u, pẹlu.
It's time for me to get angry.	O ti to akoko fun mi lati binu.
He will understand that.	Oun yoo loye iyẹn.
Take advantage of them.	Lo anfani wọn.
Who doesn’t take pictures these days?	Tani ko ya awọn aworan ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi?
I am a birthday present.	Emi ojo ibi.
This is our understanding and love.	Eyi ni oye ati ifẹ wa.
He looked at my face.	O wo oju mi.
To sell an image, it must be in good condition.	Lati ta aworan kan, o gbọdọ wa ni ipo ti o dara.
We can't stay here.	A ko le duro nibi.
This is where it ends.	Eyi ni ibi ti o pari.
And drink one day at a time.	Ati ki o mu ni ọjọ kan ni akoko kan.
I just can not say.	Mi o kan ko le sọ.
But he was not killed.	Sugbon a ko pa a gun.
This all works great.	Eleyi gbogbo ṣiṣẹ nla.
He was not angry about anything.	Oun ko binu nipa ohunkohun.
Please let us know how you heard about us.	Jọwọ jẹ ki a mọ bi o ti gbọ nipa wa.
I received three suggestions.	Mo gba imọran mẹta.
However, no one really picked up on it.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko si ẹnikan ti o gbe soke lori rẹ gaan.
This can be done by meeting in person or by phone.	Eyi le ṣee ṣe nipasẹ ipade ni eniyan tabi nipasẹ foonu.
But those people are wrong.	Ṣugbọn awọn eniyan yẹn jẹ aṣiṣe.
I made money.	Mo ti ṣe owo.
You know how you know one yourself.	O mọ bi o ti mọ ọkan ara rẹ.
I think about home, see everyone, how it will feel.	Mo ronu nipa ile, ri gbogbo eniyan, bawo ni yoo ṣe rilara.
Do not miss this opportunity.	Maṣe padanu anfani yii.
You have what it takes.	O ni ohun ti o nilo.
It takes a lot of time.	O gba akoko pupọ.
I was the last thing you ever saw.	Emi ni kẹhin ohun ti o lailai ri.
He soon forgot about the mistake.	Laipẹ o gbagbe nipa aṣiṣe naa.
We just stopped here.	A o kan duro nibi.
Very good brother to work with.	Arakunrin to dara pupọ lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
He is such a good cat.	O jẹ ologbo to dara bẹ.
After a while, the cat returned home.	Lẹhin akoko diẹ, ologbo naa pada si ile.
Because it's not me.	Nitori ti o ni ko mi.
And in particular music.	Ati ni pataki orin.
What the whole day was.	Kini gbogbo ọjọ naa jẹ.
The heat is intense.	Ooru naa dagba pupọ.
It was a pretty special time.	O je kan lẹwa pataki akoko.
Not that life.	Kii ṣe igbesi aye naa.
I plan my life around it.	Mo gbero aye mi ni ayika rẹ.
Not too sweet either.	Ko dun ju boya.
I think no one can.	Mo ro pe ko si ẹnikan ti o le.
Maybe they just raised their hands and walked out of the room.	Boya wọn kan gbe ọwọ wọn soke ti wọn si jade kuro ninu yara naa.
There are several reasons for this suggestion.	Awọn idi pupọ lo wa fun imọran yii.
I come from a big city.	Mo wa lati ilu nla kan.
That means rewards.	Iyẹn tumọ si ere.
Keep your hands off.	Pa ọwọ rẹ kuro.
I gave him the phone.	Mo fun u ni foonu.
You can leave us for now.	O le fi wa silẹ fun bayi.
I sit in my room thinking about what we can do.	Mo joko ninu yara mi ti n ronu nipa ohun ti a le ṣe.
All schools should do so.	Gbogbo awọn ile-iwe yẹ ki o ṣe bẹ.
Complete the method of payment.	Pari ọna ti owo.
It starts at home.	O bẹrẹ ni ile.
The two young men talked together.	Awọn ọdọ meji naa sọrọ papọ.
If anyone wants to come, we will take them.	Ti ẹnikan ba fẹ lati wa, a yoo gba wọn.
They are amazing to us.	Wọn jẹ iyanu fun wa.
You know it's true.	O mọ pe o jẹ otitọ.
They write their own stories.	Wọn kọ awọn itan ti ara wọn.
It also makes its own, and is very simple, very simple.	O tun ṣe ara rẹ, ati pe o rọrun pupọ, rọrun pupọ.
It has many other applications.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun elo miiran.
My wife has other plans.	Iyawo mi ni awọn eto miiran.
It seems like you have been doing this all your life.	O dabi ẹni pe o ti n ṣe eyi ni gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ.
This area is known for something else, especially.	A mọ agbegbe yii fun nkan miiran, paapaa.
He holds the upper hand because of who he is.	O di ọwọ oke nitori ẹni ti o jẹ.
He asked for benefits.	O beere fun awọn anfani.
Let me go.	Jẹ ki n lọ.
He started drinking a lot.	O bẹrẹ mimu pupọ.
There was not much in it, but there was something.	Nibẹ je ko Elo ni o, ṣugbọn nibẹ wà nkankan.
Education is important.	Ẹkọ jẹ pataki.
About three times.	Bi igba mẹta.
At first he knew surprisingly.	Ni akọkọ o ti mọ iyalẹnu.
I never told him.	Emi ko sọ fun u rara.
We cannot change now.	A ko le yi pada bayi.
What is easy for them may not be easy for us.	Ohun ti o rọrun fun wọn le ma rọrun fun wa.
He lives near here.	O ngbe nitosi ibi.
They don’t start at the top.	Wọn ko bẹrẹ ni oke.
And it's better.	O si dara ju.
Anything that happened to him?	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si i?
I'll look around.	Emi yoo wo ni ayika.
Ask them about their school problems.	Beere wọn awọn iṣoro ile-iwe wọn.
I watched it.	Mo ti wo o.
He could not really talk about the situation.	Ko le sọrọ gaan nipa ipo naa.
And no one said a word.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ọrọ kan.
Lots of music works that way.	Pupọ orin ṣiṣẹ ni ọna yẹn.
But he left.	Ṣugbọn o lọ kuro.
What you did was wrong.	Ohun ti o ṣe jẹ aṣiṣe.
You buy the items at the supermarket.	O ra awọn nkan naa ni ile itaja nla.
Do not buy any food that is not used by that day.	Maṣe ra ounjẹ eyikeyi ti a ko lo nipasẹ ọjọ yẹn.
I don’t think you can have much money to do so.	Emi ko ro pe o le ni owo pupọ lati ṣe bẹ.
I have never been good at it.	Emi ko ti dara ni rẹ rara.
We do not need your help.	A ko nilo iranlọwọ rẹ.
He has moved.	O ti gbe.
But the teacher loves more.	Ṣugbọn olukọ naa nifẹ diẹ sii.
It was one of my favorite places to go.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn aaye ayanfẹ mi lati lọ.
Get your facts right.	Gba awọn otitọ rẹ tọ.
That tree grows all year round.	Igi yẹn n dagba ni gbogbo ọdun.
I don't know how I can tell you what happened.	Emi ko mọ bi mo ṣe le sọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ fun ọ.
It made me very happy when he did.	O mu mi dun pupọ nigbati o ṣe.
Maybe have done this.	Boya ti ṣe eyi.
Change things up.	Yi ohun soke.
He was not afraid to speak his mind.	Ko bẹru lati sọ ọkan rẹ.
That’s not all, however.	Iyẹn kii ṣe gbogbo rẹ, sibẹsibẹ.
At least two people were killed in the area.	O kere ju eniyan meji ni o pa ni agbegbe naa.
No one should be here.	Ko si ọkan yẹ ki o wa nibi.
It cannot continue like this.	Ko le tẹsiwaju bi eleyi.
I’ve seen you do that before.	Mo ti rii pe o ṣe iyẹn tẹlẹ.
We cannot let that be.	A ko le jẹ ki iru bẹẹ.
The children are still happy.	Awọn ọmọ si tun dun.
We do not know.	A ko mọ.
I think we will be married.	Mo ro pe a yoo wa ni iyawo.
He walked into his house.	O rin sinu ile rẹ.
I learned not to ask.	Mo kọ ẹkọ lati ma beere.
Power for days.	Agbara fun awọn ọjọ.
I will have this baby and have my life.	Emi yoo ni ọmọ yii ki o si ni igbesi aye mi.
There are serious problems with this method, however.	Awọn iṣoro pataki wa pẹlu ọna yii, sibẹsibẹ.
Remember what he did for you.	Ranti ohun ti o ṣe fun ọ.
There is a written agreement and everything.	Iwe adehun kan wa ti a kọ ati ohun gbogbo.
Trees can get us.	Awọn igi le gba wa.
He has no father.	Ko ni baba.
I have nothing to hide !.	Nko ni nkankan lati tọju!.
Also has a few single rooms.	Tun ni kan diẹ nikan yara.
They have not seen him yet.	Wọn ko tii ri i sibẹsibẹ.
I hold my hands and place them on my lap.	Mo ti awọn ọwọ mi ati ki o gbe wọn si itan mi.
He believed he was alive.	O gbagbọ pe o wa laaye.
But it seems someone has to think it could be.	Ṣugbọn o dabi pe ẹnikan gbọdọ ronu pe o le jẹ.
Only one below.	Ọkan nikan ni isalẹ.
If it is not here, there is no place.	Ti ko ba wa nibi, ko si ibi kankan.
He turned his head to look at her.	O yi ori pada lati wo i.
Kill that with a more personal side of it.	Pa iyẹn pẹlu ẹgbẹ ti ara ẹni diẹ sii ti rẹ.
It makes sense.	O mu oye wa.
It looks like it grew out of the garden itself.	O dabi pe o dagba lati inu ọgba funrararẹ.
How they go about it is something we should not go into.	Bi wọn ṣe lọ nipa rẹ jẹ nkan ti a ko gbọdọ lọ sinu.
Or miss it.	Tabi padanu rẹ.
Please stay where you are.	Jọwọ duro si ibiti o wa.
How do you read ?.	Bi o ṣe ka?.
For less than a minute.	Fun kere ju iṣẹju kan.
Football didn't listen to me.	Bọọlu ko gbọ mi.
I must have really worked hard as a child.	Mo ti gbọdọ ti gan lile ise bi ọmọ.
I do not know what to do.	Emi ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
And most of all my friends.	Ati pupọ julọ awọn ọrẹ mi.
I feel like every song has one.	Mo lero bi gbogbo orin ni o ni ọkan.
He is not in school today.	Ko si ni ile-iwe loni.
We arrived in the city in less than an hour.	A de ilu naa ko kere ju wakati kan.
We do not know who these men may be.	A ko mọ ẹni ti awọn ọkunrin wọnyi le jẹ.
They have no idea what they are talking about.	Wọn ko ni imọran ohun ti wọn n sọrọ nipa.
That story is not true.	Itan yẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
He was there, even so.	O wa nibẹ, paapaa bẹ.
Apply them home date.	Kan wọn ile ọjọ.
Hot fire.	Ina gbona.
How long.	Bawo lo se gun to.
So they want you to use it.	Nitorina wọn fẹ ki o lo.
This is not new there.	Eyi kii ṣe tuntun nibẹ.
I don’t think he’ll last a week.	Emi ko ro pe oun yoo ṣiṣe ni ọsẹ kan.
I will be able to meet.	Emi yoo ni anfani lati pade.
But it will not always be.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo jẹ nigbagbogbo.
In fire, that is the hottest position.	Ninu ina, iyẹn ni ipo ti o gbona julọ.
It almost is.	O fẹrẹ ni.
I don’t know if you will remember me.	Emi ko mọ boya iwọ yoo ranti mi.
He said his name under it.	O sọ orukọ rẹ labẹ rẹ.
Of course, people do a little bit of that.	Dajudaju, awọn eniyan ṣe diẹ diẹ ninu iyẹn.
That is a great thing.	Nkan nla niyen.
He heard, but did not understand.	O gbọ, ṣugbọn ko loye.
I will do anything for them.	Emi yoo ṣe ohunkohun fun wọn.
Switch on the light.	Yipada lori ina.
Every day he lives with the sun.	Ni gbogbo ọjọ o n gbe pẹlu oorun.
And that means a lot to me.	Ati pe iyẹn tumọ si pupọ fun mi.
Nothing will happen.	Ko si ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
We have seen both.	A ti rii mejeeji.
Has this already happened?	Njẹ eyi ti ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ?
No one knew he was there.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ pe o wa nibẹ.
You can not change the past.	O ko le yi awọn ti o ti kọja.
And of course you know where you are.	Ati pe dajudaju o mọ ibiti o wa.
Which makes one long for a holiday.	Eyi ti o mu ki ọkan gun fun isinmi kan.
We know where it works.	A mọ ibi ti o ṣiṣẹ.
It has nothing to do with us.	Ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu wa.
The first year we did so.	Ni ọdun akọkọ ti a ṣe bẹ.
Wrong, in my opinion.	Ti ko tọ, ninu ero mi.
We had a ball at that meeting, and he took it.	A ni bọọlu kan ni ipade yẹn, o si mu u.
But this game is amazing.	Ṣugbọn ere yii jẹ iyalẹnu.
Much happens.	Pupọ ṣẹlẹ.
It may be interesting for you.	O le jẹ awon fun o.
But do not go to sleep.	Ṣugbọn maṣe lọ sun.
He had no problems with the girls.	Ko ni awọn iṣoro pẹlu awọn ọmọbirin.
That might give him some ideas.	Ti o le fun u diẹ ninu awọn ero.
I know that would mean a big deal for him.	Mo mọ pe iyẹn yoo tumọ si adehun nla fun u.
I'm better at that kind of thing than him.	Mo dara ni iru nkan yẹn ju oun lọ.
He made his way on foot.	O fi ẹsẹ ṣe ọna rẹ.
You need to know this.	O nilo lati mọ eyi.
But they make the best shoes.	Ṣugbọn wọn ṣe bata to dara julọ.
However, going to work is a fact of life.	Sibẹsibẹ, lilọ si iṣẹ jẹ otitọ ti igbesi aye.
Water is important, but not as important as food.	Omi ṣe pataki, ṣugbọn kii ṣe pataki bi ounjẹ.
Do not open it.	Maṣe ṣi i.
I don’t think that happened this year.	Emi ko ro pe iyẹn ṣẹlẹ ni ọdun yii.
You can only be dead or alive.	O le nikan ti ku tabi laaye.
Nothing to talk about.	Ko si ohun ti sọrọ.
This will be a tough game with those two.	Eyi yoo jẹ ere lile pẹlu awọn meji yẹn.
I am in your heart.	Mo wa ninu ọkan rẹ.
I enjoy things too much.	Mo gbadun ohun pupo ju.
This game may have been downloaded.	Ere yi le ti a ti gba.
Not so, but something is happening.	Ko ṣe bẹ, ṣugbọn nkan kan n ṣẹlẹ.
She gets her hands on her hair.	O gba ọwọ rẹ nipasẹ irun ori rẹ.
We’re talking lately about money.	A n sọrọ laipẹ nipa owo.
Find one and try it.	Wa ọkan ki o gbiyanju rẹ.
Things will see us.	Ohun yoo ri wa.
But we can hope it comes.	Ṣugbọn a le lero pe o nbọ.
There may be only one.	O le jẹ ọkan nikan.
That cannot happen.	Iyẹn ko le ṣẹlẹ.
And there was another person in the room.	Ati pe eniyan miiran wa ninu yara naa.
I think you get this right.	Mo ro pe o gba eyi daradara.
I quickly picked it up.	Mo yara gbe e.
For the benefit of everyone, of course.	Fun anfani ti gbogbo eniyan, dajudaju.
Now, get out of my way.	Bayi, jade kuro ni ọna mi.
Call it what you want.	Pe e ohun ti o fẹ.
You have to do it.	O ni lati ṣe.
I left the house and started walking.	Mo kuro ni ile mo si bẹrẹ si rin.
This may take some time.	Eyi le gba igba diẹ.
However it will not start.	Sibẹsibẹ kii yoo bẹrẹ.
This is very hard, and takes a lot of time.	Eyi jẹ lile pupọ, ati pe o gba akoko pupọ.
You better leave now.	O dara ki o lọ kuro ni bayi.
For a return.	Fun kan pada.
If it works.	Ti o ba ṣiṣẹ.
Two love stories.	Meji ife itan.
By doing this, you will remove your hair.	Ni ṣiṣe eyi, iwọ yoo yọ irun ori rẹ kuro.
Just feeling about it.	O kan rilara nipa rẹ.
It was a great day to be alive!	O jẹ ọjọ nla lati wa laaye!
I can't read it.	Nko le ka e.
It was bad news.	O je iroyin buburu.
I just know it’s pretty out of here.	Mo kan mọ pe o lẹwa jade nibi.
I am on the road now.	Mo wa loju ọna bayi.
I’ll let you see how we travel.	Emi yoo jẹ ki o rii bi a ṣe rin irin-ajo.
It may be the same situation you have.	O le jẹ ipo kanna ti o ni.
It's coming.	O ni o nbọ.
It only took a week to get here.	O ti gba to ọsẹ kan nikan lati wa si ibi.
You need to get over that.	O nilo lati gba lori iyẹn.
It came out a little bit when he heard about it.	O ti gbe jade diẹ diẹ nigbati o gbọ nipa rẹ.
There it is.	O wa.
He all played up an age group and performed well.	O si gbogbo dun soke ohun ori ẹgbẹ ati ki o ṣe daradara.
How to make it interesting.	Bawo ni lati ṣe awọn ti o awon.
But you, it makes me happy.	Ṣugbọn iwọ, o mu mi dun.
Some of us have seen, some of us have not.	Diẹ ninu wa ti rii, diẹ ninu wa ko.
Sell ​​the house.	Ta ile.
You never know when it will hit.	Iwọ ko mọ igba ti yoo lu.
There is no reason why it cannot be done for many things.	Ko si idi ti o ko le ṣee ṣe fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun.
But that is not news for any of you.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe iroyin fun ẹnikẹni ninu yin.
I do not want to be here.	Emi ko fẹ lati wa nibi.
The world as we know it has changed forever.	Aye bi a ti mọ pe o ti yipada lailai.
I will notice you that morning at your desk.	Emi yoo ṣe akiyesi rẹ ni owurọ yẹn ni tabili rẹ.
Their ages are about the same.	Awọn ọjọ ori wọn jẹ nipa kanna.
The boy returned and told his mother everything he had done.	Ọmọkunrin naa pada o si sọ ohun gbogbo ti o ṣe fun iya rẹ.
Possible information of small value is available.	Alaye ti o ṣee ṣe ti iye kekere wa.
Today, cars are all but drive themselves already.	Loni, awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wa gbogbo ṣugbọn wakọ ara wọn tẹlẹ.
He turned to leave.	O yipada lati jade.
There is nothing to fear.	Ko si nkankan lati bẹru.
Another situation is a more serious situation problem.	Ipo miiran jẹ iṣoro ipo buburu diẹ sii.
Like this?	Bi eleyi?
Boys, please help.	Awọn ọmọkunrin, jọwọ ṣe iranlọwọ.
The high was over.	Awọn ga wà lori.
Most of these names are still used today.	Pupọ julọ awọn orukọ wọnyi ni a tun lo loni.
Only he speaks like this.	Nikan o sọrọ bi eleyi.
But we are talking now.	Ṣugbọn a n sọrọ ni bayi.
I try to remember what place in history we came from.	Mo gbiyanju lati ranti aaye wo ni itan ti a ti de.
To explain all this would take too long.	Lati ṣe alaye gbogbo eyi yoo gba to gun ju.
It was the highest point in my life.	O jẹ aaye ti o ga julọ ni igbesi aye mi.
My parents are not together.	Awọn obi mi ko papọ.
You can do this thing.	O le ṣe nkan yii.
You can't take your eyes off him.	O ko le ya oju rẹ kuro.
Just look at yourself.	Kan wo ara rẹ.
He almost killed her.	O fẹrẹ pa a.
No questions asked.	Ko si ibeere ti o beere.
Nobody wants that !.	Ko si ẹniti o fẹ bẹ!.
They look like late teens.	Wọn dabi awọn ọdọ ti o pẹ.
By making them completely wrong.	Nipa ṣiṣe wọn ni aṣiṣe patapata.
They want to live a normal life.	Wọn fẹ lati ni igbesi aye ti o tọ laaye.
Just continue.	Kan tẹsiwaju.
He seems to enjoy seeing other women when he loves her.	O dabi ẹni pe o gbadun ri awọn obinrin miiran nigbati o nifẹ rẹ.
I brought it.	Mo mu wa.
Not enough to move on.	Ko to lati gbe lori.
We have to eat breakfast.	A ni lati jẹun owurọ.
To be honest, no one expected this to happen.	Lati sọ otitọ, ko si ẹnikan ti o nireti pe eyi yoo ṣẹlẹ.
It was.	Oun ni.
I am drawing position here.	Mo n fa ipo nibi.
I'll go now, right now, and tell them.	Emi yoo lọ ni bayi, ni bayi, ki o sọ fun wọn.
No one knows.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ.
Some of his ideas are really good.	Diẹ ninu awọn ero rẹ dara gaan.
But after a while, he grew up even to marry children.	Ṣugbọn lẹhin akoko kan, o dagba paapaa lati fẹ awọn ọmọde.
But it has just begun.	Ṣugbọn o ti bẹrẹ ni bayi.
I don’t think there are a lot of people who even come up here.	Emi ko ro pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan wa ti o paapaa wa soke nibi.
It sucks.	O mu inu.
They did not do this.	Wọn ko ṣe eyi.
O mu u.	O mu u.
What a first date.	Kini ọjọ akọkọ.
What works on one does not always work on the other.	Ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ lori ọkan ko nigbagbogbo ṣiṣẹ lori miiran.
You can if you want.	O le ti o ba fe.
We take our time.	A gba akoko wa.
He also stopped completely.	O tun duro patapata.
It can be a time.	O le ti wa ni akoko kan.
I have a job.	Mo ni ise kan.
Hot bed.	Ibusun gbona.
It's really beautiful.	O lẹwa gaan.
There was bad, as well.	Nibẹ wà buburu, bi daradara.
There are two main reasons for this approach.	Ọna yii jẹ awọn idi pataki meji.
That doesn’t make sense either.	Iyẹn ko ṣe oye boya.
It’s time to get this back on track.	O to akoko lati gba eyi pada si ọna.
Still have the same problem.	Tun ni iṣoro kanna.
I do not have a friend.	Emi ko ni ọrẹ kan.
Please keep me this way.	Jọwọ pa mi mọ ni ọna yii.
I never told you.	Nko so fun yin rara.
Let something small go.	Jẹ ki nkan kekere lọ.
He spent a little money on books.	O lo owo kekere kan lori awọn iwe.
He wanted to see me one last time.	O fe lati ri mi kan kẹhin akoko.
You know a little bit about yourself.	O mọ kekere kan funrararẹ.
I'm not sure.	Emi ko da mi loju.
And maybe they won't.	Ati boya wọn yoo ko.
Wa ra, wa ra.	Wa ra, wa ra.
I will not change.	Emi kii yoo yipada.
But if you leave now, everything will be over.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba lọ kuro ni bayi, ohun gbogbo yoo ti pari.
But they have not yet left, they have locked themselves inside the buildings.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko tii lọ, wọn ti ti ara wọn si inu awọn ile naa.
Long and hot days.	Awọn ọjọ gun ati gbona.
I say this.	Mo sọ eyi.
He died at the scene.	O ku ni aaye naa.
In humans, they cannot be seen.	Ninu eniyan, wọn ko le rii.
It makes me happy.	O mu inu mi dun.
There are no errors at this time.	Ko si awọn aṣiṣe ni akoko yii.
It seems to do well.	O dabi pe o ṣe daradara.
Trouble is coming.	Wahala n bọ.
Remember what you said.	Ranti ohun ti o sọ.
I met them.	Mo pade wọn.
I did so well.	Mo ṣe bẹ daradara.
So why did you decide to end your life?	Nitorina kilode ti o pinnu lati pari aye rẹ?
A good life begins when they accept this truth.	Igbesi aye ti o dara bẹrẹ nigbati wọn gba otitọ yii.
I left under the conditions of everyone.	Mo fi silẹ labẹ awọn ipo ti gbogbo eniyan.
Often, that’s great.	Nigbagbogbo, iyẹn jẹ nla.
Do nothing.	Maṣe ṣe ohunkohun.
He seems to be his first man.	O dabi pe o jẹ ọkunrin akọkọ rẹ.
This method may not take some rain pictures.	Ọna yii ko le mu diẹ ninu awọn aworan ojo.
I think we were.	Mo ro pe a wà.
But that will not help.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.
It could be too much for him.	O le ju fun u.
I can make sure you understand.	Mo le rii daju pe o loye.
Change them if you can.	Yi wọn pada ti o ba le.
You never know when it will come to this.	O ko le mọ pe yoo wa si eyi.
Of course, we cannot understand.	Dajudaju, a ko le loye.
One day last winter, he walked into one.	Ni ọjọ kan ni igba otutu to kọja, o rin sinu ọkan.
I will get my kids to read.	Emi yoo gba awọn ọmọ mi lati ka.
Make sure you try this one if you have the space.	Rii daju pe o gbiyanju eyi ti o ba ni aye.
Maybe you know.	Boya o mọ.
And it says a lot more about it.	Ati pe o sọ pupọ diẹ sii nipa rẹ.
They are both amazing with kids.	Wọn jẹ iyanu mejeeji pẹlu awọn ọmọde.
How youthful love makes me feel.	Bawo ni ifẹ ọdọ ṣe mu mi rilara.
I sat in my seat and said nothing to him.	Mo joko ni ijoko mi ko si sọ ọrọ kan fun u.
Just thinking about it makes my mouth happy.	Ti o kan ronu nipa rẹ jẹ ki ẹnu mi dun.
Everyone who was there was there.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o wà ẹnikẹni wà nibẹ.
I was afraid to walk.	Mo bẹru lati rin.
The story is easy to understand.	Itan naa rọrun lati ni oye.
I will go with you when we pass.	Emi yoo ba ọ lọ nigbati a ba kọja.
Another brother might see that.	Arakunrin miiran le rii iyẹn.
It works through lunch.	O ṣiṣẹ nipasẹ ounjẹ ọsan.
Everyone helped on it and tried to stop it.	Gbogbo eniyan ṣe iranlọwọ lori rẹ ati gbiyanju lati da a duro.
There is no way you should take it, but you do.	Ko si ọna ti o yẹ ki o mu, ṣugbọn o ṣe.
Remember the stories you told?	Ranti awọn itan ti o sọ?
You need to come up with that truth.	O nilo lati wa pẹlu otitọ yẹn.
They are of age.	Wọn jẹ ti ọjọ ori.
This friend cannot continue like this anymore.	Ọrẹ yii ko le tẹsiwaju bi eleyi mọ.
I have never seen it.	Emi ko tii ri.
Please don't kill me.	Jọwọ maṣe pa mi.
Stories told about our lives	Awọn itan ti a sọ nipa igbesi aye wa
Good, but the same.	O dara, ṣugbọn kanna.
We will drive there.	A yoo wakọ nibẹ.
This is my favorite restaurant.	Eyi ni ile ounjẹ ayanfẹ mi.
A local community sitting on a stunning beach.	Agbegbe agbegbe ti o joko lori eti okun iyalẹnu kan.
Make it personal.	Ṣe o ti ara ẹni.
He could not go out to her.	Ko le jade lọ si ọdọ rẹ.
He had worked long hours.	O ti ṣiṣẹ awọn wakati pipẹ.
You see what you want to see.	O ri ohun ti o fẹ lati ri.
O sare sare.	O sare sare.
There was no time to wait, he said.	Ko si akoko lati duro, o sọ.
And we shouldn’t.	Ati pe a ko yẹ.
Let's go home, and do the work.	Jẹ ki a lọ sinu ile, ati ṣe iṣẹ naa.
Do not leave the device unattended.	Maṣe fi ẹrọ naa silẹ ni ṣiṣe.
He would never know what hit him.	Oun yoo ko mọ ohun ti o lu u.
There is no other place like yours ever.	Ko si aaye miiran bi rẹ lailai.
Applications should not use this method.	Awọn ohun elo ko yẹ ki o lo ọna yii.
He said nothing that night.	Ko sọ nkankan ni alẹ yẹn.
He said he loved me with it, which stopped him forever.	O sọ pe o fẹ mi pẹlu rẹ, ti o da ọ duro lailai.
I see what is happening to me.	Mo rii ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ si mi.
It should not be.	Ko yẹ ki o le.
The problem with that question is when you ask.	Iṣoro pẹlu ibeere naa jẹ nigbati o ba beere.
The company is yours.	Ile-iṣẹ naa jẹ tirẹ.
And, you can't see and touch information.	Ati pe, o ko le rii ati fi ọwọ kan alaye.
I will never see this thing.	Emi kii yoo rii nkan yii rara.
He alone is not fast.	Oun nikan ni ko yara.
That is, if you can believe them.	Iyẹn ni, ti o ba le gbagbọ wọn.
I can not think of anything to write.	Emi ko le ronu ohunkohun lati kọ.
It comes from within.	O wa lati inu.
The car veered off the road.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa yọ kuro ni ọna.
You know what you're talking about.	O mọ ohun ti o n sọrọ nipa rẹ.
He is calling me.	O n pe mi.
A new restaurant has opened on the road.	Ile ounjẹ tuntun ti ṣii ni opopona.
He wrote down my questions and asked yours.	O kọ awọn ibeere mi silẹ o beere lọwọ tirẹ.
More than anything, we can’t buy.	Ju ohunkohun lọ, a ko le ra.
I have great family and great friends.	Mo ni ebi nla ati awọn ọrẹ nla.
It was a very young school.	O je kan gan odo ile-iwe.
And it works really well.	Ati awọn ti o ṣiṣẹ gan daradara.
Just do whatever you can.	O kan ṣe ohunkohun ti o le.
And he could not find anything.	Ati pe ko le ri nkankan.
Everyone saw it.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o si wo o.
He wants to come back years before now.	O fẹ lati pada wa ni awọn ọdun ṣaaju bayi.
They tell each other.	Wọn sọ fun ara wọn.
And they would have died three weeks ago.	Ati pe wọn yoo ti ku ni ọsẹ mẹta sẹhin.
It is not a good thing.	O ti wa ni ko kan ti o dara.
I look forward to hearing from you.	Mo nireti lati ro ero rẹ.
You can paint them or not.	O le kun wọn tabi rara.
Everyone is nice and helpful.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o dara ati iranlọwọ.
It was just raining.	Ojo nikan lo je.
You will not see it.	O yoo ko ri rẹ.
What happened happened.	Ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ti ṣẹlẹ.
Let's have some dinner.	Jẹ ki a jẹ ounjẹ alẹ diẹ.
That is our job.	Ise wa niyen.
Do this as much as you can.	Ṣe eyi bi o ṣe le ṣe.
But once you let it go, do not let it go.	Ṣugbọn ni kete ti o jẹ ki o lọ, maṣe jẹ ki o lọ silẹ.
I haven’t finished with your hand yet.	Emi ko ti pari pẹlu ọwọ rẹ sibẹsibẹ.
It acts like the sun.	O ṣe bi oorun.
He spent time visiting with his mother, sister, and brother.	O lo akoko lati ṣabẹwo pẹlu iya rẹ, arabinrin, ati arakunrin rẹ.
As you can see.	Bi o ti ri.
I tried again.	Mo tun gbiyanju.
No one will ever have a life like that again.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo ni aye bii iyẹn lẹẹkansi.
I firmly believe that this is true.	Mo gbagbọ gaan pe eyi jẹ otitọ.
These are obvious benefits.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn anfani ti o han gbangba.
We have no problem with ideas.	A ko ni iṣoro pẹlu awọn ero.
That’s how it looks here.	Iyẹn ni bi o ṣe ri nibi.
I don't like this.	Emi ko fẹ eyi.
That morning in question.	Ti owurọ ni ibeere.
If you know please help.	Ti o ba mọ jọwọ ran.
Every family needs that.	Gbogbo idile nilo iyẹn.
That is, you should be able to understand.	Iyẹn, o yẹ ki o ni anfani lati ni oye.
This is the only road to our area.	Eyi nikan ni opopona si agbegbe wa.
Some men pull this out of surprise.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọkunrin fa eyi kuro ni iyalẹnu.
And people are also here.	Ati awọn eniyan ti o tun wa nibi.
I love to let you.	Mo nifẹ lati jẹ ki o.
It is very important to stay.	O ṣe pataki pupọ lati duro.
No one about.	Ko si ẹnikan nipa.
But you need it.	Ṣugbọn o nilo rẹ.
Not always very good.	Nigbagbogbo ko dara pupọ.
To tell them everything.	Lati sọ ohun gbogbo fun wọn.
I do not think that will make me happy anymore.	Emi ko ro pe iyẹn yoo mu inu mi dun mọ.
Everyone is important to him.	Gbogbo eniyan jẹ pataki fun u.
Make sure they can feel the heat.	Rii daju pe wọn le lero ooru.
The field is the same length.	Aaye naa jẹ ipari kanna.
But when he just said he looked like it.	Ṣugbọn nigbati o kan sọ pe o dabi rẹ.
The door behind him.	Ilẹkun tii lẹhin rẹ.
I said they hurt a lot.	Mo sọ pe wọn ṣe ipalara pupọ.
I tried it on a few before.	Mo gbiyanju o lori kan diẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
I am thinking now.	Mo n ronu ni bayi.
We are even in the same class at school.	A wa paapaa ni kilasi kanna ni ile-iwe.
That is another possibility.	O ṣeeṣe miiran niyẹn.
His music career began when he was young.	Iṣẹ orin rẹ bẹrẹ nigbati o jẹ ọdọ.
I have no idea what they are.	Emi ko ni imọran kini wọn jẹ.
He wants a drink.	O fe ohun mimu.
Both brand new.	Mejeeji tuntun tuntun.
So you can say all the things you want.	Nitorina o le sọ gbogbo awọn ohun ti o fẹ.
I'm sure there must be more.	Mo ni idaniloju pe diẹ gbọdọ wa.
You can always go back to the good old days.	O le nigbagbogbo pada si awọn ti o dara atijọ ọjọ.
That’s two people who love football.	Iyẹn jẹ awọn eniyan meji ti o nifẹ bọọlu.

All in it are believed to have been killed.	Gbogbo awọn ti o wa ninu rẹ ni a gbagbọ pe wọn ti pa.
I'm glad to be home.	Inu mi dun lati wa ni ile.
There will be enough opportunity for that.	Anfani yoo wa to fun iyẹn.
Can't enjoy any good you have.	Ko le gbadun eyikeyi ti o dara ti o ni.
These houses are beautiful.	Awọn ile wọnyi jẹ lẹwa.
My body already knows you.	Ara mi ti mọ ọ ni bayi.
Always expect the best.	Nigbagbogbo reti ohun ti o dara julọ.
We really hope you enjoy these.	A nireti gaan pe o gbadun awọn wọnyi.
Enjoy our stay.	Gbadun wa duro.
It was too high for that point.	O ti ga ju fun aaye yẹn.
Now you know what that thing is.	Bayi o mọ kini nkan naa jẹ.
It happened this month.	O ṣẹlẹ ni oṣu yii.

No, not at all.	Rara, rara rara.
Our service could not be less to use.	Iṣẹ wa ko le kere si lati lo.
He told us their stories.	O sọ awọn itan wọn fun wa.
But you can talk.	Ṣugbọn o le sọrọ.
It was hard, but in the end it was worth it.	O jẹ lile, ṣugbọn ni ipari o tọ si.
I get understanding and I give help.	Mo gba oye ati pe Mo fun iranlọwọ.
Much has happened this past year.	Pupọ ti ṣẹlẹ ni ọdun to kọja yii.
And the cost.	Ati iye owo.
You are all in it.	Gbogbo yin ni o wa ninu rẹ.
I don’t even think you love it.	Emi ko paapaa ro pe o nifẹ rẹ.
Don’t take life too seriously, kids.	Maṣe gba igbesi aye ni pataki, awọn ọmọde.
The table has been removed.	Ti yọ tabili naa kuro.
But not the past.	Sugbon ko ti o ti kọja.
I need to make one more, new to this program.	Mo nilo lati ṣe ọkan si, tuntun si eto yii.
To continue to where you left off.	Lati tẹsiwaju si ibiti o ti lọ kuro.
He thought for a minute.	O ronu fun iṣẹju kan.
For me, this is a good opportunity.	Fun mi, eyi jẹ anfani to dara.
I am happy to lose a special friend.	Inu mi dun lati padanu ọrẹ pataki kan.
These days, we know a lot more.	Awọn ọjọ wọnyi, a mọ pupọ diẹ sii.
It has been.	O ti wa.
It will be our opportunity.	Yoo jẹ anfani wa.
Police have cordoned off the road.	Awọn ọlọpa ti pa ọna naa mọ.
The car stopped.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa duro.
The problem is, someone does.	Iṣoro naa ni, ẹnikan ṣe.
None of them seemed to work for me.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o dabi pe o ṣiṣẹ fun mi.
He could not stay here.	Ko le duro ni ibi.
I still have a lot to say.	Mo tun ni ọpọlọpọ lati sọ.
I need to get back to you.	Mo nilo lati pada si o.
Your job is done.	Iṣẹ rẹ ti lọ.
Story into a game.	Itan sinu ere kan.
It is very easy to use.	O rọrun pupọ lati lo.
You’ve talked all the way here.	O ti sọrọ ni gbogbo ọna nibi.
You never know how it will turn out.	O ko mọ bi yoo ṣe ṣe.
Thus, only two remain.	Bayi, awọn meji nikan ni o ku.
Their questions are met, almost to the letter.	Awọn ibeere wọn pade, o fẹrẹ si lẹta naa.
There is an old shop on the edge of town.	Ile itaja atijọ kan wa ni eti ilu.
I will not tell anyone.	Emi kii yoo sọ fun ẹnikẹni.
I have a question at this point.	Emi ni ibeere ni akoko yii.
That leaves a trail.	Iyẹn fi ọna kan silẹ.
I let myself go.	Mo jẹ ki ara mi lọ.
You never know when this is going to happen.	O ko mọ pe eyi n lọ.
I turned to the boy.	Mo yipada si ọmọkunrin naa.
They all know it.	Gbogbo wọn mọ ọ.
I can say that he did not.	Mo le sọ pe ko ṣe bẹ.
Ask them where they heard it.	Beere wọn nibo ni wọn ti gbọ.
They will not talk to him.	Wọn ko ni ba a sọrọ.
They are on the losing side.	Wọn wa ni ẹgbẹ ti o padanu.
You can call my mother.	O le pe iya mi.
To be sure, there can be nothing in it.	Lati ni idaniloju, ko si ohun ti o le wa ninu rẹ.
Things have found out these days.	Ohun ti ri jade wọnyi ọjọ.
The money never lost.	Owo naa ko padanu owo rara.

You will keep it, because you love me.	Iwọ yoo pa a mọ, nitori iwọ fẹran mi.
We live where we left off.	A gbe ibi ti a ti kuro.
I’m not very sure about that and.	Emi ko ni idaniloju pupọ nipa iyẹn ati.
It should be off after an hour.	O yẹ ki o pa lẹhin wakati kan.
We will not change.	A ko ni yi pada.
I love this group.	Mo nifẹ ẹgbẹ yii.
And we can.	Ati pe a le.
You need someone.	O nilo ẹnikan.
No, wait, it's there.	Rara, duro, o wa nibẹ.

Please ask for details.	Jọwọ beere fun awọn alaye.
And no one moved.	Ko si si ẹniti o gbe.
I saw you talking to a man today.	Mo ti ri o sọrọ si ọkunrin kan loni.
You are good too.	Iwọ naa dara.
You are my mother.	Iwọ ni iya mi.
What happened to me was not because of an accident.	Ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si mi kii ṣe nitori ijamba.
In other words, they are not human.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, wọn kii ṣe eniyan.
But it is not easy.	Ṣugbọn o rọrun kii ṣe.
It could be the day before, a week or a month.	O le jẹ ọjọ ṣaaju, ọsẹ kan tabi oṣu kan.
He wrote a song that everyone knows.	O kọ orin kan ti gbogbo eniyan mọ.
At least someone understands to.	O kere ẹnikan ni oye lati.
No, that is not the case.	Rara, kii ṣe iyẹn.
The power he gave me was amazing.	Agbara ti o fun mi jẹ iyanu.
And you can.	Ati pe o le.
The new house is painted inside and out.	Ile tuntun ti ya ni inu ati ita.
Or not the money.	Tabi kii ṣe owo naa.
Most people do not have such a life as a student.	Pupọ eniyan ko ni iru aye bii ọmọ ile-iwe.
They arrived at his house.	Wọn de ile ti rẹ.
It is in our hands.	O wa ni ọwọ wa.
This does not make much sense to me.	Eyi ko ṣe oye diẹ si mi.
Water is essential for all kinds of life.	Omi jẹ pataki fun gbogbo iru aye.
They can hurt.	Wọn le ṣe ipalara.
Here we are in the office.	Nibi a wa ni ọfiisi.
Stay where you want.	Duro ni ibi ti o fẹ.
See what happens there.	Wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nibẹ daradara.
In the front, he saw another dog and wanted to go.	Ni iwaju, o ti ri aja miiran ati pe o fẹ lati lọ.
Do not change.	Maṣe yi pada.
It costs a lot of money to live in a city.	O jẹ owo pupọ lati gbe ni ilu kan.
Everyone is angry.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o binu.
Do not eat or drink anything.	Ko jẹ tabi mu ohunkohun.
Not everyone was there that day.	Kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan ni ọjọ yẹn.
More information may not be available in the world here.	Alaye diẹ le ma wa ni aye nibi.
This can be seen visually.	Eyi le rii ni oju.
Let’s play one way at a time.	Jẹ ki a mu ni ọna kan ni akoko kan.
We have, however, talked on the phone a few times.	A ti, sibẹsibẹ, sọrọ lori foonu kan diẹ igba.
What he wants from you and why.	Ohun ti o fe lati rẹ ati idi ti.
It always makes you happy.	O nigbagbogbo jẹ ki inu rẹ dun.
But the doctor understood.	Ṣugbọn dokita loye.
Not even here.	Ko paapaa nibi.
He decided to apply for the job.	O pinnu lati beere fun iṣẹ naa.
You see, they, well.	Ṣe o rii, wọn, daradara.
But no, that did not happen in his house.	Ṣugbọn rara, iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ ninu ile rẹ.
I'll get it wrong.	Emi yoo gba aṣiṣe.
I wouldn’t want to hurt anyone here.	Emi kii yoo fẹ lati ṣe ipalara fun eniyan kan nibi.
I would not be here if it were not for him.	Emi kii yoo wa nibi ti kii ba ṣe fun u.
Let us keep these letters.	Jẹ ki a tọju awọn lẹta wọnyi.
You have to do it like this.	O ni lati ṣe bi eleyi.
Our house is very nice.	Ile wa dara gaan.
It makes a lot more sense.	O ṣe ori pupọ diẹ sii.
This is a problem.	Kini wahala.
No first.	Ko si akọkọ.
They charge.	Wọn gba agbara.
None of them can.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o le.
It does not feel.	Ko ni rilara.
You can help by that stuff.	O le ṣe iranlọwọ nipasẹ nkan naa.
I have two.	Mo ni ife meji.
Here goes nothing.	Nibi lọ ohunkohun.
The very person we will see, in fact.	Eniyan gan ti a yoo rii, ni otitọ.
But not my mother.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe iya mi.
At first it wasn’t the best thing.	Ni akọkọ kii ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
This application is good for these purposes.	Ohun elo yii dara fun awọn idi wọnyi.
Is the name wrong.	Ṣe orukọ naa jẹ aṣiṣe.
Be who you are.	Jẹ ẹniti o jẹ.
To be strong, people turn to heat.	Lati jẹ agbara, awọn eniyan yipada si ooru.
Sooner or later, he thinks of everything.	Laipẹ tabi ya, o ronu ohun gbogbo.
A lot of this stuff is all around.	Ọpọlọpọ nkan yii wa ni ayika.
It is a thought.	O ti wa ni a ronu.
You will learn a lot from our lessons.	Iwọ yoo kọ ẹkọ pupọ lati awọn ẹkọ wa.
The school will open soon.	Ile-iwe yoo ṣii laipẹ.
There is no place to appear again.	Ko si aye lati han lẹẹkansi.
I mean people.	Mo tumọ si awọn eniyan.
We are a little tired.	A ti rẹ wa diẹ.
But he was trying to get to me.	Ṣugbọn o n gbiyanju lati wa si ọdọ mi.
I keep them to count to my children.	Mo pa wọn mọ lati ka si awọn ọmọ mi.
No, no, not for me.	Rara, rara, kii ṣe fun mi.
I don’t have to do anything.	Emi ko ni lati ṣe nkan kan.
Your mouth is working.	Ẹnu rẹ n ṣiṣẹ.
But it is impossible to say.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣee ṣe lati sọ.
Your man.	Ọkunrin tirẹ.
I remember a little of where we went, or even what we did.	Mo ranti diẹ ti ibi ti a lọ, tabi paapaa ohun ti a ṣe.
I don’t know how they knew where they were found.	Emi ko mọ bi wọn ṣe mọ ibiti wọn ti rii.
The sister got along well with the other students.	Arabinrin naa dara pẹlu awọn ọmọ ile-iwe miiran.
No, you do not.	Rara, o ko ni.
I know!	Mo wa mọ!
For two reasons.	Fun awọn idi meji.
Sometimes they go for a walk on the beach.	Nigba miiran wọn ni lilọ rin lori eti okun.
The sister went into the book a lot to her surprise.	Arabinrin naa wọ inu iwe naa pupọ si iyalẹnu rẹ.
We cannot get it back.	A ko le gba pada.
We fear this will happen.	A bẹru pe eyi yoo ṣẹlẹ.
I would say so.	Emi yoo sọ bẹ.
You should drive.	O yẹ ki o wakọ.
No history or anything is required for this.	Ko si itan tabi ohunkohun ti a beere fun eyi.
We went to leave.	A lọ lati lọ kuro.
Children can help change this situation.	Awọn ọmọde le ṣe iranlọwọ lati yi ipo yii pada.
Do this.	Ṣe eyi ni.
I have no idea what is outside that door.	Emi ko ni imọran ohun ti o wa ni ita ilẹkun yẹn.
Not there.	Ko si nibẹ.
Please go this way.	Jọwọ lọ si ọna yii.
I just need time to think through it.	Mo kan nilo akoko lati ronu nipasẹ rẹ.
And we have to come up with a better plan.	Ati pe a ni lati wa pẹlu eto to dara julọ.
You will see, one of these days.	Iwọ yoo rii, ọkan ninu awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
It’s time we did something.	O to akoko ti a ṣe nkankan.
She is doing well now.	O n ṣe daradara ni bayi.
It is both our home.	Ile wa mejeeji ni.
Try to take care of your mother.	Gbiyanju lati tọju iya rẹ.
Everything you need.	Gbogbo ohun ti o nilo.
I was the same day my sister did.	Mo wa ni ọjọ kanna ti arabinrin mi ṣe.
The work was a great holiday for me.	Iṣẹ naa jẹ isinmi nla fun mi.
We live well.	A n gbe daradara.
They leave you alone.	Wọn fi ọ silẹ nikan.
There is nothing there.	Ko ni nkankan nibẹ.
I don’t think about it.	Emi ko ronu nipa rẹ.
I see it this way often in rooms.	Mo rii ni ọna yii nigbagbogbo ninu awọn yara.
The bread is hot.	Awọn akara jẹ gbona.
He divorced himself.	O kọ ara rẹ silẹ.
Just let us be human.	O kan jẹ ki a jẹ eniyan.
Inside and outside, one.	Ninu ati ita, ọkan.
He will not even come back.	Ko paapaa yoo pada wa.
Notice this happens on the question.	Ṣe akiyesi eyi n ṣẹlẹ lori ibeere.
So he hit the baby.	Nitorina o lu ọmọ naa.
This is the house you need.	Eyi ni ile ti o nilo.
He is regaining his life.	O n gba igbesi aye rẹ pada.
These points are made.	Awọn aaye wọnyi ti ṣe.
She told me her story in a few hours.	O sọ itan rẹ fun mi ni awọn wakati diẹ.
We did not intend to take so.	A ko pinnu lati mu bẹ.
It cannot grow.	Ko le dagba.
Everyone knows you can fast.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ pe o le yara.
They use these trees.	Wọn lo awọn igi wọnyi.
They were there for me.	Wọn wa nibẹ fun mi.
He is no longer a boy, but he is not a man yet.	Ko si jẹ ọmọkunrin mọ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọkunrin sibẹsibẹ.
One book can take you to another world.	Iwe kan le gbe ọ lọ si aye miiran.
Their hands move.	Ọwọ wọn gbe.
We do not know what they are or what caused them.	A ko mọ ohun ti wọn jẹ tabi ohun ti o fa wọn.
Her age and date of birth are unknown.	Ọjọ ori ati ọdun ibi rẹ ko ti mọ.
Better than ever this is my piece of work.	Dara ju lailai yi ni mi nkan ti ise.
And by the way, it’s not how you get them.	Ati nipasẹ ọna, kii ṣe bi o ṣe gba wọn.
I gotta Feeling.	Mo ni rilara.
But things are not as simple as they seem at first.	Ṣugbọn awọn nkan kii ṣe rọrun bi wọn ṣe dabi akọkọ.
I'm afraid you can't come back.	Mo bẹru pe o ko le pada wa.
You have a job.	O ni ise kan.
I use this method.	Mo lo ọna yii.
It can grow to a minimum in the end.	O le dagba si o kere ju ni ipari.
You know your way around.	O mọ ọna rẹ ni ayika.
We are in love.	A wa ninu ifẹ.
He usually looks at the little book in contracts.	O maa n wo iwe kekere ni awọn adehun.
The waters rose.	Awọn omi dide.
She is one of my best friends.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọrẹ mi to dara julọ.
Find a way.	Wa ọna kan.
I really wanted to try it.	Mo gan fe lati gbiyanju o.
You have to improve your human skills.	O ni lati mu awọn ọgbọn eniyan rẹ dara si.
I have a reason.	Mo ni idi.
I try to remember it.	Mo gbiyanju lati ranti rẹ.
But worth it.	Sugbon tọ o.
We can do something.	A le ṣe nkan kan.
It’s changing time.	O n yi akoko pada.
For others, it takes several hours.	Fun awọn miiran, o gba to awọn wakati pupọ.
I will not be there.	Emi kii yoo wa nibẹ.
It’s all not lost, however.	Gbogbo rẹ ko padanu, sibẹsibẹ.
You can expect him to make the right decision.	O le nireti pe oun yoo ṣe ipinnu ti o tọ.
There seemed to be nothing he could do.	O dabi enipe ko si ohun ti o le ṣe.
In fact it is better for you than working after dinner.	Ni otitọ o dara julọ fun ọ ju ṣiṣẹ lẹhin ounjẹ alẹ.
Okay, try it.	O dara, gbiyanju rẹ.
We can, they say.	A le ṣe, wọn sọ.
But it has been great.	Ṣugbọn o ti jẹ nla.
She will be a great mother.	Iya nla ni yoo jẹ.
And that's all it was.	Ati awọn ti o ni gbogbo awọn ti o wà.
It gave me about two hours.	O fun mi ni bii wakati meji.
He died for me.	O ku fun mi.
I went back to bed.	Mo pada si ibusun.
But it seems to be happy.	Ṣugbọn o dabi ẹni pe o dun.
Most importantly, be skeptical of anything and everything you see.	Pataki julọ, jẹ ṣiyemeji ohunkohun ati ohun gbogbo ti o rii.
He died here.	O ku nibi.
I wasn’t around to play until last week.	Emi ko ni ayika lati mu ṣiṣẹ titi di ọsẹ to kọja.
There is nothing to expect, nothing to expect.	Ko si nkankan lati nireti, ko si nkankan lati nireti.
Children can learn to write letters.	Awọn ọmọde le kọ ẹkọ lati kọ awọn lẹta.
I will not help you either.	Emi kii yoo ran ọ lọwọ pẹlu.
He grabbed me and let me go.	O di mi mu ko si jẹ ki lọ.
It seems the right place.	O dabi ibi ti o yẹ.
Repeat this every morning and every night before going to bed.	Tun eyi ṣe ni gbogbo owurọ ati ni gbogbo alẹ ṣaaju ki o to sun.
He wants to give.	O fe lati fun ni.
My family loves to eat for dinner.	Idile mi nifẹ lati jẹun fun ounjẹ alẹ.
But it stays in the same place.	Ṣugbọn o duro ni ibi kanna.
He said he needed dinner and the boat needed more work.	O sọ pe o nilo ounjẹ alẹ ati pe ọkọ oju omi nilo iṣẹ diẹ sii.
We agreed to meet for a drink.	A gba lati pade fun ohun mimu.
This is as expected.	Eyi jẹ bi a ti nireti.
And he was a man who really liked the game.	Ati pe o jẹ ọkunrin kan ti o fẹran ere naa gaan.
How do you think this should be done ?.	Bawo ni o ṣe ro pe eyi yẹ ki o ṣee?.
It is another thing to understand how life begins.	O jẹ ohun miiran lati ni oye bi igbesi aye ṣe bẹrẹ.
But they did not.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko ṣe.
Some people were a hard sell.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan je kan lile ta.
Not too long.	Ko gun ju.
They try to keep it.	Wọn gbiyanju lati pa a mọ.
Some long but it also allows them to take advantage.	Diẹ ninu awọn gun ṣugbọn o tun gba wọn lati lo anfani.
Let it rise.	Jẹ ki o dide.
But you are not really here.	Ṣugbọn iwọ ko wa nibi gaan.
They know what to do.	Wọn mọ kini lati ṣe.
Someone give me a hand!	Ẹnikan fun mi ni ọwọ!
Someone has to say something.	Ẹnikan gbọdọ sọ nkankan.
Everyone hopes that the project will be someone's problem.	Gbogbo eniyan nireti pe iṣẹ naa yoo jẹ iṣoro ẹnikan.
He is also there.	O tun wa nibẹ.
She has beautiful eyes.	O ni oju lẹwa.
It's not football.	Ko ṣe bọọlu.
Have tried many times.	Ti gbiyanju ọpọlọpọ igba.
I don’t think it will go away.	Emi ko ro pe yoo lọ kuro.
I do not want to go.	Emi ko fẹ lati lọ.
I'm just sorry for you.	Mo kan binu fun ọ.
I should know that he will.	Emi yẹ ki o mọ pe oun yoo.
The time is now.	Akoko ni bayi.
Do you want something to drink?	Ṣe o fẹ nkankan lati mu?
Lots of questions.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere.
He told me to keep my mouth shut and listen.	O sọ fun mi pe ki n pa ẹnu mi mọ ki n gbọ.
That’s the only way to find out if it’s worth the money.	Iyẹn nikan ni ọna lati wa boya o ni iye fun owo.
No children to live.	Ko si ọmọ lati gbe.
He does not want money.	Ko fe owo.
Maybe they are.	Boya wọn jẹ.
Her children did too.	Awọn ọmọ rẹ tun ṣe.
But it will be obvious when we look and feel.	Ṣugbọn yoo han gbangba nigbati a wo ati rilara.
Wait for more.	Duro fun diẹ sii.
Three times, he was almost killed.	Ni igba mẹta, o ti fẹrẹ pa a.
And many others were turned away.	Ati ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran ni a yipada kuro.
Today, two things happen.	Loni, ohun meji ṣẹlẹ.
I have more.	Mo ni diẹ.
Not needed only for the purpose.	Ko nilo nikan ni idi.
Human life is just that.	Igbesi aye eniyan jẹ eyi nikan.
Just work your new position.	O kan ṣiṣẹ ipo tuntun rẹ.
We must celebrate the child's birthday.	A gbọdọ ṣe ayẹyẹ ọjọ ibi ọmọ.
It was a beautiful day and we had to do something.	O jẹ ọjọ ti o lẹwa ati pe a ni lati ṣe nkan kan.
Give, and it will be given to you.	Fi fun, a o si fi fun ọ.
It's that simple.	O rọrun yẹn.
I know this to be true.	Mo mọ eyi lati jẹ otitọ.
I will leave that for the community to decide.	Emi yoo fi iyẹn silẹ fun agbegbe lati pinnu.
I know for sure they didn’t.	Mo mọ daju pe wọn ko ṣe.
Do all this without even carrying an application.	Ṣe gbogbo eyi laisi paapaa gbe ohun elo kan.
However they are obvious enough.	Sibẹsibẹ wọn han gbangba to.
He went to help them.	O si lọ lati ran wọn.
These are my people.	Awọn wọnyi ni eniyan mi.
That is our only advantage.	Anfani wa nikan niyen.
This is not human.	Eyi kii ṣe eniyan.
I can believe it myself.	Mo le gbagbọ funrararẹ.
I don’t wait until things get out of hand anymore.	Emi ko duro titi awọn nkan yoo fi jade ni ọwọ mọ.
He said he would look into it and call me back.	O sọ pe oun yoo wo inu rẹ ki o pe mi pada.
I talk about it here.	Mo sọrọ nipa rẹ nibi.
They were all still scared.	Gbogbo wọn si tun bẹru.
We're just trying to hide from some of you men.	A n kan gbiyanju lati tọju lati diẹ ninu awọn ọkunrin ti o.
You put two and two together here, and it doesn’t make sense.	O fi meji ati meji papọ nibi, ati pe ko ṣe oye.
He wants you to have it all.	O fe ki o ni gbogbo rẹ.
Not only that, it goes up and down.	Kii ṣe iyẹn nikan, o lọ si oke ati kọja.
But everything is.	Ṣugbọn ohun gbogbo ni.
The road is closed.	Opopona ti pa.
That was in time.	Iyẹn jẹ ni akoko.
Every man wants to burn me, and some women, too.	Gbogbo ọkunrin fe lati sun mi, ati diẹ ninu awọn obinrin, ju.
He does not want us to live with anxiety.	Ko fẹ ki a gbe pẹlu aniyan.
I have made my decision.	Mo ti ṣe ipinnu mi.
He knows the area well.	O mọ agbegbe naa daradara.
I pulled a car over to him.	Mo fa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan si i.
That's great, baby.	Nkan nla niyẹn, ọmọ.
I should ask my dad one of these days.	Mo yẹ ki o beere baba mi ọkan ninu awọn wọnyi ọjọ.
Make a plan.	Ṣe eto kan.
Some were good and some were not.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti o wà dara ati diẹ ninu awọn wà ko.
I have already jumped on board.	Mo ti fo lori ọkọ tẹlẹ.
He picked me up.	O gbe mi.
You will work, if you let the work last a minute.	Iwọ yoo ṣiṣẹ, ti o ba jẹ ki iṣẹ naa kọja iṣẹju kan.
The highest peaks rise on tree trunks.	Oke ti o ga julọ ga soke lori awọn igi igi.
I enjoy that.	Mo gbadun iyẹn.
You really want to know how the story ends.	O fẹ gaan lati mọ bi itan naa ṣe pari.
She hated her mother for this.	O korira iya rẹ fun eyi.
You did not do well.	O ko ṣe daradara.
Kids get angry these days.	Awọn ọmọde binu ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
Where did that money come from ?.	Nibo ni owo yẹn ti wa?.
We will talk about both.	A yoo sọrọ nipa awọn mejeeji.
Maybe not for another year or so.	Boya kii ṣe fun ọdun miiran tabi bii.
I hate this.	Mo korira eyi.
My name is.	Orukọ mi ni.
That is our future.	Ojo iwaju wa niyen.
You swim the best you can.	O we ti o dara julọ ti o le.
And it does not matter.	Ati pe ko ṣe pataki.
Not in the stories.	Ko si ni awọn itan.
I have no idea what you are trying to do.	Emi ko ni imọran ohun ti o n gbiyanju lati ṣe.
I plan to change jobs.	Mo gbero lati yi awọn iṣẹ pada.
I know they are coming for me.	Mo mọ pe wọn n bọ fun mi.
I agree with you.	Mo gba fun ọ.
It almost sold out.	O fẹrẹ ta jade.
I will not stand outside.	Emi o duro ni ita.
Before that it was something that was required by law.	Ṣaaju ki o to jẹ ohun kan ti a beere nipasẹ ofin.
Where it should be, for whatever reason.	Ibi ti o yẹ ki o wa, fun ohunkohun ti idi.
The sister is very beautiful.	Arabinrin naa lẹwa pupọ.
Way to it.	Ọna si rẹ.
But you are not just about the sun.	Ṣugbọn iwọ kii ṣe nipa oorun nikan.
I will tell the truth with you.	Emi yoo sọ otitọ pẹlu rẹ.
This is the most important thing for us.	Eyi ni ohun ti o ṣe pataki julọ fun wa.
No one expected this to happen.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o nireti pe eyi yoo ṣẹlẹ.
It takes time to write something well.	O gba akoko lati kọ nkan daradara.
There are many questions about this group.	Awọn ibeere pupọ lo wa nipa ẹgbẹ yii.
He accepted and we left the phone.	O gba ati pe a kuro ni foonu.
She found herself, a few years older, sitting in a chair.	O ri ara rẹ, ọdun diẹ ti o dagba, o joko ni ijoko kan.
I met my husband.	Mo pade ọkọ mi.
Let me allow you.	Jẹ ki n gba ọ laaye.
Rules for everything.	Awọn ofin fun ohun gbogbo.
I'm glad you said.	Inu mi dun pe o sọ.
This is why so many people turn to books.	Eyi ni idi ti ọpọlọpọ eniyan fi yipada si awọn iwe.
They have come back to stop us.	Wọn ti pada wa lati da wa duro.
It is what the girls decide on their own.	O jẹ ohun ti awọn ọmọbirin pinnu lori ara wọn.
He gave me the money.	O fi owo naa fun mi.
I was wrong.	Mo ṣe aṣiṣe.
Needless to say anything else.	Ko nilo lati sọ ohunkohun miiran.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Kii ṣe igba akọkọ ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Most of them come from the company.	Pupọ ninu wọn wa lati ori ile-iṣẹ.
You see, it's simple.	Ṣe o rii, o rọrun.
It takes and there is no error.	O n gba ati pe ko si aṣiṣe.
They need to talk.	Wọn nilo lati sọrọ.
A few times a day.	Awọn igba diẹ ni ọjọ kan.
You need to give people life.	O nilo lati fun eniyan ni aye.
They have a company.	Wọn ni ile-iṣẹ.
She looked up and laughed.	O wo soke o si rẹrin.
The process takes two hours.	Ọna naa gba wakati meji.
Can't get anything right now.	Ko le gba nkankan ni bayi.
Those things are good, especially when it comes to contract time.	Awọn nkan yẹn dara, paapaa nigbati o ba de akoko adehun.
I know how to do that.	Mo mọ bi mo ṣe le ṣe iyẹn.
If anyone can do this.	Ti ẹnikẹni ba le ṣe eyi.
Money has nothing to do with it, he told me.	Owo ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ, o sọ fun mi.
She asked the question when she closed her eyes.	O beere ibeere naa nigbati o pa oju rẹ.
It's full.	O kun patapata.
Let’s move on with it.	Jẹ ki a tẹsiwaju pẹlu rẹ.
In fact, we know very little about it.	Ni otitọ, a mọ diẹ diẹ nipa rẹ.
He didn't seem to want anything from her.	O dabi pe ko fẹ ohunkohun lọwọ rẹ.
Can't take pictures.	Ko le ya awọn aworan.
He could not believe his family was talking about this very much.	Ko le gbagbọ pe ebi rẹ n sọrọ nipa eyi gaan.
These systems are available.	Awọn ọna ṣiṣe wọnyi wa o si wa.
The player name is below.	Orukọ ẹrọ orin wa ni isalẹ.
I want you to stay here.	Mo fẹ ki o duro nibi.
It looks amazing in all these pictures.	O dabi iyanu ni gbogbo awọn aworan wọnyi.
For the first time ever.	Fun igba akọkọ ni lailai.
I let it stand.	Mo jẹ ki o duro.
It is still available, especially in books.	O tun wa, paapaa ninu awọn iwe.
In the end, even the light notice can go back.	Ni ipari, paapaa akiyesi ina le pada sẹhin.
You know a lot of things.	O mọ ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
Now is my time.	Bayi o jẹ akoko mi.
His hands on her.	Ọwọ rẹ lori rẹ.
That is a person who has no future.	Iyẹn jẹ eniyan ti ko ni ọjọ iwaju.
Now that is true.	Bayi iyẹn jẹ otitọ.
They are personal.	Wọn ṣe ti ara ẹni.
Finished at the top which went well.	Ti pari ni oke ti o lọ daradara.
None of it will ever work.	Ko si ọkan ninu rẹ ti yoo ṣiṣẹ lailai.
But the child did not speak.	Ṣugbọn ọmọ ko sọrọ.
Jump up and down.	Fo soke ati isalẹ.
Not here.	Ko si nibi.
For years.	Fun odun.
And this is my home.	Ati pe eyi ni ile mi.
I need one.	Mo nilo ọkan.
Yesterday, that changed and the reason is not clear.	Lana, iyẹn yipada ati idi ko han.
However, for others it may take longer.	Sibẹsibẹ, fun awọn miiran o le gba to gun.
You know that.	O mọ ohun yẹn.
This man was everything to me.	Ọkunrin yi je ohun gbogbo mi.
You can continue, if you wish.	O le tẹsiwaju, ti o ba fẹ.
They are made of wood.	Igi kan ni a fi ṣe wọn.
This house caught fire.	Ina gba ile yi.
He wants to run from her, whatever the cost.	O fe lati sare lati rẹ, ohunkohun ti iye owo.
But they will not miss a meal.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii yoo padanu ounjẹ kan.
We would be very happy to help.	Inu wa yoo dun gaan lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
I can't do either.	Emi ko le ṣe boya.
He was a friend of many people, including me.	O jẹ ọrẹ ti ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan, pẹlu emi.
Maybe not the best on the strength, but they are all around.	Boya kii ṣe ti o dara julọ lori agbara, ṣugbọn wọn ti wa ni ayika.
I want to find love.	Mo fe ri ife.
My mother asked me why even.	Iya mi beere lọwọ mi idi paapaa.
But there is.	Sugbon o wa.
Come to call your sister.	Wa lati pe arabinrin rẹ.
They are that good.	Wọn ti wa ni wipe ti o dara.
No words.	Ko ni ọrọ.
There are several ways to do this.	Awọn ọna pupọ lo wa lati ṣe eyi.
Just, nothing happened.	O kan, ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Maybe one day, my friend.	Boya ni ọjọ kan, ọrẹ mi.
Now back to work.	Bayi pada si iṣẹ.
We have your clothes.	A ni awọn aṣọ rẹ.
We will make new friends.	A yoo ṣe awọn ọrẹ tuntun.
Everything seemed to work.	Ohun gbogbo dabi enipe o ṣiṣẹ.
I have lost my strength now because of that.	Mo ti padanu okun mi bayi nitori iyẹn.
Build your own world.	Kọ ara rẹ aye.
I can’t do it myself.	Emi ko le ṣe funrararẹ.
Put the key in your pocket.	Fi bọtini sinu apo rẹ.
Others should have already moved.	Awọn miiran yẹ ki o ti gbe tẹlẹ.
It could be a bad day today.	O le jẹ ọjọ buburu kan loni.
That place and that day.	Ibi yẹn ati ọjọ yẹn.
She had a lot of time to find another man.	O ni akoko pupọ lati wa ọkunrin miiran.
He is also homeless.	O tun ko si ile.
These are not noticeable, they say.	Awọn wọnyi ko ni akiyesi, wọn sọ.
I'm sure she turned her face away.	Mo da mi loju pe o yi oju re.
But of course you will learn something.	Ṣugbọn dajudaju iwọ yoo kọ nkan kan.
I have to look back.	Mo ni lati wo ẹhin.
There is no possible way.	Ko si ọna ti o ṣeeṣe.
Do you not like them?	Ṣe o ko fẹran wọn?
It should be full for at least another three days.	O yẹ ki o kun fun o kere ju ọjọ mẹta miiran.
But they did not want to go out.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko fẹ lati jade.
That's probably why your environment becomes.	Ti o ni jasi idi rẹ ayika di.
Do not give up.	Maṣe fi ara rẹ silẹ.
This is not nearly enough as we already have.	Eyi ko fẹrẹ to bi a ti ni tẹlẹ.
However, something went wrong.	Sibẹsibẹ, nkankan ti ko tọ.
She could not help but find herself in the man.	O ko le ran ṣugbọn ri ara rẹ ninu ọkunrin naa.
He told the most amazing stories.	O si sọ awọn itan iyanu julọ.
It was a hot day.	O je kan gbona ọjọ.
The body is very important here for two reasons.	Ara jẹ pataki pataki nibi fun awọn idi meji.
He will grow up.	Oun yoo dagba.
The sister did not like him.	Arabinrin naa ko fẹran rẹ.
An old house stands on a hill.	Ile atijọ kan duro ni ori oke kan.
He never said a word about it.	Ko sọ ọrọ kan nipa rẹ rara.
And he loved it.	Ati ki o feran o.
And dad doesn't know.	Ati baba ko mọ.
We measure the words that people say.	A ti wọn ọrọ ti eniyan n sọ.
It is something we do or do not do.	O jẹ ohun ti a ṣe tabi ṣe.
There is no maximum limit you can get.	Ko si oke iye to le gba.
I used to talk about these things.	Mo ti lo lati sọrọ nipa nkan wọnyi.
Make a statement.	Ṣe alaye kan.
Enjoy money and energy.	Gbadun owo ati agbara.
I'm sure you know what that is.	Mo da ọ loju pe o mọ kini iyẹn.
All of this is simple human wisdom.	Gbogbo eyi jẹ ọgbọn eniyan ti o rọrun.
People do not die for something they know is not true.	Awọn eniyan ko ku fun nkan ti wọn mọ pe kii ṣe otitọ.
No problem, he said.	Ko si iṣoro, o sọ.
Just enjoy the thing, and enjoy your life.	O kan gbadun nkan naa, ki o si gbadun igbesi aye rẹ.
I am not sure why this is not clearly understood.	Emi ko ni idaniloju idi ti eyi ko han gbangba loye.
In many trials.	Ni ọpọlọpọ awọn idanwo.
I happened to be at home that night.	Mo ṣẹlẹ lati wa ni ile ni alẹ yẹn.
People will kill for them.	Eniyan yoo pa fun wọn.
What they saw was especially surprising to them.	Ohun ti wọn rii jẹ iyalẹnu paapaa fun wọn.
On the phone.	Lori foonu.
And it is more than necessary.	Ati pe o jẹ diẹ sii ju pataki lọ.
It is in every one.	O wa ni gbogbo ọkan.
He gave what many of us have.	O si fun ohun ti ọpọlọpọ awọn ti wa.
He could not even ask them.	Ko le beere lọwọ wọn paapaa.
We have to meet again soon.	A ni lati pade lẹẹkansi laipẹ.
The future is crucial.	Ojo iwaju ni ohun ti o ṣe pataki.
I will go with you.	Emi yoo lọ pẹlu rẹ.
I can not stop them.	Nko le da won duro.
You can kill someone, but not just because you do not like it.	O le pa ẹnikan, ṣugbọn kii ṣe nitori pe o ko fẹran ẹnikan nikan.
He refuses to believe that.	O kọ lati gbagbọ pe.
You do not even have to ask.	O ko paapaa ni lati beere.
That is more than enough for many reasons.	Iyẹn ju to fun awọn idi pupọ julọ.
I will read the book as soon as it comes out.	Emi yoo ka iwe naa ni kete ti o ba jade.
Our kids are in school, you know.	Awọn ọmọ wa ni ile-iwe, o mọ.
Working late has its benefits.	Ṣiṣẹ pẹ ni awọn anfani rẹ.
I am here by bus.	Mo wa nibi nipasẹ ọkọ akero.
This is the time to enjoy.	Eyi jẹ akoko lati gbadun.
No words.	Ko si awọn ọrọ.
His only shoes.	Re nikan bata.
He broke away when he was forced to leave.	O ya kuro nigbati o fi agbara mu lati lọ kuro.
If anyone can help me please contact me.	Ti ẹnikẹni ba le ran mi lọwọ jọwọ kan si mi.
We can put this on our back and move on.	A le fi eyi si ẹhin wa ki o tẹsiwaju.
Stop on things.	Da duro lori ohun.
You look at your phone.	O wo foonu rẹ.
I have a great doctor.	Mo ni dokita nla kan.
They do not read.	Wọn ko ka.
She went to get some bread.	O lọ mu akara.
They want to return home.	Wọn fẹ lati pada si ile wọn.
I meet people.	Mo pade awon eniyan awon eniyan.
But few people know.	Ṣugbọn diẹ eniyan ni o mọ.
Big companies make big profits.	Awọn ile-iṣẹ nla ṣe awọn ere nla.
Don’t think this doesn’t help.	Maṣe ro pe eyi ko ṣe iranlọwọ.
So look out.	Nitorina wo jade.
What seems to be the problem?	Kini o dabi pe o jẹ iṣoro naa?
Please wait and listen.	Jọwọ duro ki o gbọ.
But he understood things.	Ṣugbọn o loye awọn nkan.
We run as fast as we can.	A sare bi a ti le.
You just have to think.	O kan ni lati ronu.
I spent a lot of time talking to him last night.	Mo lo akoko pupọ lati ba a sọrọ ni alẹ ana.
He waited no longer than any did.	O si duro ko gun ju eyikeyi ṣe.
This is the first location in a small town.	Eyi ni ipo akọkọ ni ilu kekere kan.
Your bed may rise slightly.	Ori ibusun rẹ le dide diẹ.
I believe it should have been done.	Mo gbagbọ pe o yẹ ki a ti ṣe.
They will grow and multiply.	Wọn yoo dagba ati pupọ.
You look at your age.	O wo ọjọ ori rẹ.
It makes you believe you can do anything.	O jẹ ki o gbagbọ pe o le ṣe ohunkohun.
I have to give back.	Mo ni lati fun pada.
Nice to get it with here and now.	Dara julọ lati gba o pẹlu nibi ati bayi.
I should do more of these.	Mo yẹ ki o ṣe diẹ sii ti awọn wọnyi.
She looks very young.	O dabi ọmọde pupọ.
She was afraid to fly.	O bẹru lati fo.
Teachers should not worry about test errors.	Awọn olukọ ko yẹ ki o ṣe aniyan nipasẹ awọn aṣiṣe idanwo.
I look back at the water.	Mo wo pada si omi.
He received a cash prize for his services.	O gba ẹbun owo fun awọn iṣẹ rẹ.
Will eat well tonight.	Yoo jẹun daradara ni alẹ oni.
He took a train to the city.	O gba ọkọ oju irin si ilu naa.
He was determined to say.	O ti pinnu lati sọ.
I have seen him.	Mo ti ri fun u.
You try to find what you think is best.	O gbiyanju lati wa ohun ti o ro pe o dara julọ.
He did not move.	O ko gbe.
Makes a lot more sense.	Mu ki a Pupo diẹ ori.
My father was the best person in my marriage.	Baba mi ni eniyan ti o dara julọ ni igbeyawo mi.
So fear.	Nitorina bẹru.
I'm back in time.	Mo pada wa ni akoko.
It's long, but it's worth reading.	O gun, ṣugbọn o tọ lati ka.
I think you missed the point.	Mo ro pe o padanu aaye naa.
Just don't listen.	O kan ko gbọ.
It took almost a year to renovate the building.	O fẹrẹ to ọdun kan lati tun ile naa pada.
Just used to do.	O kan lo lati ṣe.
He couldn’t believe he was worried about that.	Ko le gbagbọ pe o ti ni aniyan nipa iyẹn.
It was amazing with the kids.	O jẹ iyanu pẹlu awọn ọmọde.
He also could not believe how it could happen one day.	O tun ko le gbagbọ bi o ṣe le ṣẹlẹ ni ọjọ kan.
You know such things.	O mọ iru awọn nkan bẹẹ.
Take it when you can.	Mu u nigba ti o le.
If you want to travel, you will do the same.	Ti o ba fẹ rin irin-ajo, iwọ yoo tun ṣe bẹ.
At my workplace.	Ni ibi iṣẹ mi.
Too bad for them.	Ju buburu fun wọn.
We have a lot of work to do there as well.	A ni ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ lati ṣe nibẹ pẹlu.
This is to make things right.	Eyi ni lati jẹ ki awọn nkan tọ.
Drinking too much.	Mimu pupọ.
Here and there it sounds like a word.	Nibi ati nibẹ ni ohun ti o dun bi ọrọ kan.
It is outdoors.	O wa ni ita gbangba.
Great in bed.	Nla ni ibusun.
That's too easy.	Iyẹn rọrun ju.
She said she was happy for him.	O ni inu oun dun fun oun.
I forgot this.	Mo gbagbe eyi.
Nice to be on board.	O dara lati wa lori ọkọ.
Good thing good.	O dara ohun dara.
He was trying to kill himself.	O n gbiyanju lati pa ara rẹ.
Take your time and think about it.	Gba akoko rẹ ki o ronu nipa rẹ.
Was a look at what happened on the game.	Wà a wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ lori ere.
The picture will be in this room from now on.	Aworan naa yoo wa ninu yara yii lati igba yii lọ.
Where there is no money and no future.	Ibi ti ko si owo ati ojo iwaju.
It’s a tool to speed things up.	O jẹ ohun elo kan lati yara awọn nkan.
Beautiful pictures that make your mouth water.	Awọn aworan lẹwa ti o jẹ ki ẹnu rẹ di omi.
I want this to stop.	Mo fẹ ki eyi duro.
He died for us.	O ku fun wa.
He wants you to know their words for him.	O fẹ pe o mọ ọrọ wọn fun rẹ.
That is it.	Ti o jẹ ti o.
People here must leave their old homes.	Awọn eniyan nibi gbọdọ fi ile atijọ wọn silẹ.
Back outside.	Pada si ita.
It is good.	O ti dara.
There are some people who want to talk to you.	Awọn eniyan kan wa ti o fẹ lati ba a sọrọ.
I can't wait to try one out.	Emi ko le duro lati gbiyanju ọkan jade.
He is a teacher.	O jẹ olukọ.
To the river, the world is the world.	Si odo, aye ni aye.
However, it is not that simple.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe pe o rọrun.
What do you think of these ?.	Kini o ro ti awọn wọnyi?.
He will be my best friend.	Oun yoo jẹ ọrẹ mi to dara julọ.
My device is not important.	Ẹrọ mi kii ṣe nkan pataki.
And he wanted to.	Ati pe o fẹ.
A word of caution is below.	Ọrọ ti o ni imọran wa ni isalẹ.
Do not force yourself.	Maṣe fi agbara mu ara rẹ.
It really is.	O ni gaan.
Back to the matter.	Pada si ọrọ.
But he could not tell her the truth.	Ṣugbọn ko le sọ otitọ fun u.
The group held a public meeting.	Ẹgbẹ naa ṣe ipade gbogbo eniyan.
He is already dead.	O ti ku tẹlẹ.
You can take yours with you.	O le mu awọn tirẹ pẹlu rẹ.
And something else.	Ati ohun miiran.
The road to that thing.	Ọna si nkan naa.
That is the main reason.	Idi akọkọ niyẹn.
I know your names.	Mo mọ awọn orukọ rẹ.
You will be better off.	Iwọ yoo dara julọ.
Anything good takes time.	Ohunkohun ti o dara gba akoko.
Get away from me!	Lọ kuro mi!
Find out early in the year.	Wa jade ni kutukutu akoko ti odun.
The children laughed a lot.	Awọn ọmọ rẹrin gidigidi.
She wants to see me.	O fẹ lati ri mi.
Now may be the time.	Bayi le jẹ akoko.
If there are planes to fly.	Ti awọn ọkọ ofurufu lati fo wa.
However, now is not the time to really get into it.	Sibẹsibẹ, bayi kii ṣe akoko ti o dara lati wọ inu rẹ ni pataki.
It's great.	O jẹ nla.
Play three games.	Mu awọn ere mẹta ṣiṣẹ.
Good.	O dara.
They sat down, but no one knew.	Wọn ti joko, ṣugbọn ko si mọ.
Would it be nice to just pick up the phone and call him ?.	Ṣe yoo dun lati kan gbe foonu ki o pe e?.
If he doesn’t laugh, give it a look.	Ti ko ba rẹrin, fi fun oju ẹgbẹ.
However, they are.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn wa.
That doesn’t even make sense.	Iyẹn ko paapaa ni oye.
They need to work together.	Wọn nilo lati ṣiṣẹ papọ.
It's gone but a minute.	O ti lọ sugbon iṣẹju kan.
It doesn't matter what the issue is.	Ko ṣe pataki kini nkan naa jẹ.
He has his hands full.	O ni ọwọ rẹ kun.
So much money flies away every day.	Ki Elo owo fo kuro ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Because of what will happen.	Nitori ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
He took us home and showed me.	O mu wa ile o si fi mi han.
No one is going to sleep tonight after what they see.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo sun ni alẹ oni lẹhin ohun ti wọn rii.
It can also be done with people.	O tun le ṣe pẹlu eniyan.
Life, in fact, is easy to understand.	Aye, ni otitọ, rọrun lati ni oye.
I am just happy to finish with it.	Inu mi kan dun lati pari pẹlu rẹ.
I was not able to bring myself to look through it.	Emi ko ni anfani lati mu ara mi wa lati wo nipasẹ rẹ.
He decided to stop and reinvent himself.	O pinnu lati da ati tun ara rẹ pada.
He has a wonderful family.	O ni idile iyanu.
It does not seem so.	O dabi ko.
It has been amazing.	O ti jẹ iyanu.
I know of family.	Mo mọ ti ebi.
Possibly local again.	O ṣee ṣe agbegbe lẹẹkansi.
It looks like a decision to have another child.	O dabi ipinnu lati ni ọmọ miiran.
She has decided to sell some of her pictures.	O ti pinnu lati ta diẹ ninu awọn aworan rẹ.
I will think about that tomorrow.	Emi yoo ronu nipa iyẹn ni ọla.
He was here last night.	O wa nibi ni alẹ ana.
She is there to pick up her baby.	O wa nibẹ lati gbe ọmọ rẹ.
What is required.	Ohun ti a beere.
I knew he would not.	Mo mọ pe oun yoo ko.
Of course we will see.	Dajudaju a yoo rii.
I do not see any.	Emi ko ri eyikeyi.
Through the years.	Nipasẹ awọn ọdun.
Others kept him away.	Awọn miiran pa a kuro.
The biggest problem is his ability to kill.	Iṣoro nla ni agbara rẹ lati pa a.
This is not a task.	Eyi kii ṣe iṣẹ ṣiṣe.
I haven't heard back yet.	Emi ko tii gbọ pada sibẹsibẹ.
Some treat it, others do not.	Diẹ ninu awọn tọju rẹ, awọn miiran ko ṣe.
Okay, you can wake up.	O dara, o le ji.
They both lifted us up.	Won gbe ara wa mejeeji soke.
I brought a book with me.	Mo mu iwe kan wa pẹlu mi.
That in itself has been great.	Iyẹn funrararẹ ti jẹ nla.
But this is not good for him.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko dara fun u.
Words like he died.	Awọn ọrọ bi o ti ku.
It’s nice to have an application to work on.	O dara lati ni ohun elo lati ṣiṣẹ lori.
I don't like it that way at all.	Emi ko fẹran rẹ ni ọna yẹn gaan.
I tried it again.	Mo tun gbiyanju o.
He is not angry.	O ko binu.
It will all go away at this time next year.	Gbogbo rẹ yoo lọ ni akoko yii ni ọdun ti n bọ.
It seems like a small space even if it starts.	O dabi aaye kekere paapaa ti o bẹrẹ.
I quit before something bad could happen.	Mo fi silẹ ṣaaju ki nkan buburu le ṣẹlẹ.
I would ask for the service.	Emi yoo beere fun iṣẹ naa.
Like that.	Bii pe.
Handy here.	Ni ọwọ nibi.
But this time, he continued.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yii, o tẹsiwaju.
You need to help people.	O nilo lati ran eniyan lọwọ.
It was something all my kids enjoyed.	O jẹ ohun ti gbogbo awọn ọmọ mi gbadun.
We know that from our father.	A mọ iyẹn lati ọdọ baba wa.
You do whatever it takes.	O ṣe ohunkohun ti o gba.
All this time my sisters did not say a word.	Ni gbogbo akoko yii awọn arabinrin mi ko sọ ọrọ kan.
I like to talk to people.	Mo nifẹ lati ba eniyan sọrọ.
Put it back.	Fi pada.
You just want to start with your important work.	O kan fẹ lati bẹrẹ pẹlu iṣẹ pataki rẹ.
I will tell you this from your mother.	Emi yoo sọ eyi fun ọ lati ọdọ iya rẹ.
If you are in a mood to change this, forget it.	Ti o ba wa ninu ọkan rẹ pe o le yi eyi pada, gbagbe rẹ.
Get to it.	Gba si o.
If you do, leave it alone for another minute.	Ti o ba ṣe bẹ, fi silẹ nikan fun iṣẹju miiran.
This should be a journey with a purpose, not a game time.	Eyi yẹ ki o jẹ irin-ajo pẹlu idi kan, kii ṣe akoko ere.
And a little.	Ati kekere kan.
That means rewards.	Iyẹn tumọ si awọn ere.
We give you something.	A fun o nkankan.
But it is full enough.	Sugbon o ti kun to.
One night, he went to bathe alone.	Ni alẹ ọjọ kan, o lọ wẹ nikan.
You are going to have a baby.	O ti wa ni lilọ lati bi a ọmọ.
You will need to stay together.	Iwọ yoo nilo lati duro papọ.
We have to look at both sides.	A ni lati wo ẹgbẹ mejeeji.
Since then he has not asked any questions.	Lati igba naa ko ti beere ibeere kankan.
But you can do the right thing here.	Ṣugbọn o le ṣe ohun ti o tọ nibi.
I have seen it many times.	Mo ti rii ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
He has the power to change his circumstances.	O ni agbara lati yi awọn ipo rẹ pada.
I'm going up.	Mo n lọ soke.
Nothing important is changed.	Ko si ohun pataki ti wa ni yi pada.
It is for you.	O wa fun ọ.
Of course you are going about it the wrong way.	Dajudaju iwọ n lọ nipa rẹ ni ọna ti ko tọ.
I have no reason to change my mind on this.	Emi ko ni idi lati yi ero mi pada lori eyi.
We have all made mistakes.	Gbogbo wa ti ṣe awọn aṣiṣe.
It makes no sense for me to put them back on.	Ko ṣe oye fun mi lati fi wọn pada si.
You are in the wrong area.	O wa ni agbegbe ti ko tọ.
You do not know how to do it.	O ko mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe.
Other than that, go for it.	Miiran ju iyẹn lọ, lọ fun.
As we write this letter to you.	Bi a ti n kọ lẹta yii si ọ.
I will paint your story.	Emi yoo kun itan rẹ.
You want life without me.	O fẹ igbesi aye laisi mi.
Little bad things.	Awọn nkan kekere ti ko dara.
I do not matter.	Emi ko ṣe pataki.
Very good one.	Ọkan ti o dara pupọ.
Not many people are standing with it right now.	Ko ọpọlọpọ eniyan duro pẹlu rẹ ni bayi.
And sometimes they are both at the same time.	Ati nigba miiran wọn jẹ mejeeji ni akoko kanna.
I revealed myself early.	Mo fi ara mi han ni kutukutu.
If it is anything, they will want to change what you want.	Ti o ba jẹ ohunkohun, wọn yoo fẹ lati yi ohun ti o fẹ pada.
Families began to grow smaller.	Awọn idile bẹrẹ si dagba kere.
Knocked on the door again.	Ti lu ilẹkun lẹẹkansi.
Finish it today.	Pari rẹ loni.
And what they have done.	Ati ohun ti wọn ti ṣe.
Things change, things remain the same.	Awọn nkan yipada, awọn nkan wa kanna.
I hit your story.	Mo lu itan rẹ.
That is not what it is about.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti o jẹ nipa.
Please help our school grow.	Jọwọ ran ile-iwe wa lọwọ lati dagba.
These shoes are great.	Awọn bata wọnyi dara julọ.
They have to do this, they can't do that.	Wọn gbọdọ ṣe eyi, wọn ko le ṣe bẹ.
Someone who works with his hands.	Ẹnikan ti o ṣiṣẹ pẹlu ọwọ rẹ.
I will not say again.	Emi kii yoo sọ mọ.
Police did not suspect the game.	Ọlọpa ko fura si ere.
You know what you want to do.	O mọ ohun ti o fẹ ṣe.
He seems to be telling a story.	O dabi ẹni pe o n sọ itan kan.
It has been a long day.	O ti jẹ ọjọ pipẹ.
He hopes it has been such an accident.	O nireti pe o ti jẹ iru ijamba kan.
Wrong.	Ko tọ si.
Believe in the possibilities for your life.	Gbagbọ ninu awọn aye ti o ṣeeṣe fun igbesi aye rẹ.
I told him to go get it.	Mo sọ fun u pe ki o lọ gba.
I just don’t seem to let that happen.	Emi ko kan dabi lati gba iyẹn lati ṣẹlẹ.
They don't like me here.	Wọn ko fẹ mi nibi.
My thoughts are with you.	Awọn ero mi wa pẹlu rẹ.
Something should be behind it.	Ohun kan yẹ ki o wa lẹhin rẹ.
Just get what you can.	O kan gba ohun ti o le.
Together, we will take care of the children.	Papọ, a yoo tọju awọn ọmọde.
I had never noticed that before.	Emi ko ṣe akiyesi iyẹn tẹlẹ.
That never happened.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ rara.
How many of us have contacted each other?	Bawo ni ọpọlọpọ ninu wa ti kan si ara wa?
I have used my head.	Mo ti lo ori mi.
We will do this next week.	A yoo ṣe eyi ni ọsẹ to nbọ.
Water is essential for life.	Omi jẹ pataki fun igbesi aye.
Well, not a machine.	O dara, kii ṣe ẹrọ kan.
We give them.	A fun wọn.
But it is still too high.	Sugbon o tun ga ju.
We just try to get and get through.	A kan gbiyanju lati gba ati gba nipasẹ.
It was the brother.	Arakunrin naa ni.
Students do not go to school anymore.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ko lọ si ile-iwe mọ.
I have my period this morning.	Mo ni nkan oṣu mi ni owurọ yi.
With his words.	Pẹlu awọn ọrọ rẹ.
Someone left my house.	Eniyan kan ti jade kuro ni ile mi.
I do not have to know anything else.	Emi ko ni lati mọ ohunkohun miiran.
They did that well.	Wọn ṣe iyẹn daradara.
It is well worth it.	O ti wa ni daradara tọ o.
I don’t mean to do.	Emi ko tumọ lati ṣe.
I do not get a specific reason yet.	Emi ko gba idi ti o kan sibẹsibẹ.
Just hope they catch on.	O kan lero ti won yẹ lori.
I believe we have the resources.	Mo gbagbọ pe a ni awọn ohun elo.
You will only understand when you grow up.	Iwọ yoo loye nikan nigbati o ba dagba.
People who miss games will hate us.	Awọn eniyan ti o padanu ere yoo korira wa.
Nothing else is known about his back.	Ko si ohun miiran ti a mọ nipa ẹhin rẹ.
The work is repeated again and again.	Iṣẹ naa tun ṣe lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
That works well.	Ti o ni ṣiṣe daradara.
But do not forget.	Sugbon ko gbagbe.
Which may be the idea.	Eyi ti o le jẹ ero naa.
Time of truth.	Akoko ti otitọ.
After we used forever try to have one.	Lẹhin ti a lo lailai gbiyanju lati ni ọkan.
He put himself in it.	O fi ara rẹ si.
But that doesn’t change things.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko yi awọn nkan pada.
They want status.	Wọn fẹ ipo.
With your help or dead.	Pẹlu iranlọwọ rẹ tabi ti ku.
Neither did he live to see that day.	Bẹni ko gbe lati ri ọjọ naa.
This is not a game.	Eyi kii ṣe ere.
I have seen this often on this board.	Mo ti ri yi igba lori yi ọkọ.
Look at my father.	Wo baba mi.
You can let yourself do this.	O le jẹ ki ara rẹ ṣe eyi.
There is one now.	Ọkan wa bayi.
That will only begin.	Ti yoo bẹrẹ nikan.
He looked at me again.	O tun wo mi lẹẹkansi.
Either way, someone will be with you this afternoon.	Ọna boya, ẹnikan yoo wa pẹlu rẹ ni ọsan yii.
But the truth must be alive.	Ṣugbọn otitọ gbọdọ wa laaye.
This seemed to make it better.	Eyi dabi enipe o jẹ ki o dara julọ.
I don't like that at all.	Emi ko fẹran iyẹn rara.
You are here.	O wa nibi.
We did not lock the front door.	A ko ti ilẹkun iwaju.
Again, this is not the company you want to work with.	Lẹẹkansi, eyi kii ṣe ile-iṣẹ ti o fẹ ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
So leave the music there.	Nitorina kuro ni orin nibẹ.
And you have a point.	Ati pe o ni aaye kan.
They may not understand the situation.	Wọn le ma loye ipo naa.
He is no longer a man.	Ko ṣe eniyan mọ.
Wait like any clock.	Duro bi aago eyikeyi.
But just get out of sight.	Ṣugbọn o kan kuro ni oju.
Last time, he changed his mind.	Ni akoko ikẹhin, o yi ọkan rẹ pada.
Not my father.	Ko baba mi.
But he's not in love with me.	Sugbon o ni ko ni ife pẹlu mi.
There is work to be done.	Ise wa lati se.
One will lose.	Ọkan yoo padanu.
Do not let the bad guys get it.	Maṣe jẹ ki awọn eniyan buburu gba.
It was amazing to work with him.	O jẹ iyalẹnu lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
It is beyond words.	O ti kọja ọrọ.
They are here, now they are not.	Wọn wa nibi, bayi wọn kii ṣe.
Your house stands on a hill.	Ile rẹ duro lori oke kan.
Everyone has the same opportunity.	Gbogbo eniyan ni anfani kanna.
It has taken a year !.	O ti gba ọdun kan!.
I thought something.	Mo ro nkankan.
I have to remember that it is not about me.	Mo ni lati ranti pe kii ṣe nipa mi.
Everything inside me, everything outside me.	Ohun gbogbo ti inu mi, ohun gbogbo ita mi.
But, he is very anxious.	Ṣugbọn, o ni aniyan pupọ.
The sister is very nice about it.	Arabinrin naa dara pupọ nipa rẹ.
This is true even when angry.	Eyi jẹ otitọ paapaa nigbati o binu.
She is my sister.	Arabinrin mi ni.
Impossible is not a fact.	Ko ṣee ṣe kii ṣe otitọ kan.
And you can have.	Ati pe o le ni.
Take some time off work.	Gba akoko diẹ ninu iṣẹ.
And it was really fun.	Ati awọn ti o wà gan fun.
He could not stand forever.	Ko le duro lailai.
They tried so hard.	Wọn gbiyanju pupọ.
Water will not work.	Omi kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
I would never have told anyone else about it ever.	Emi kii yoo ti sọ fun ẹnikẹni miiran nipa rẹ lailai.
There is something in them, but we can not find the books.	Nkankan wa ninu wọn, ṣugbọn a ko le rii awọn iwe naa.
And you will eat more.	Ati pe iwọ yoo jẹ diẹ sii.
We can use someone with his abilities.	A le lo ẹnikan pẹlu awọn agbara rẹ.
And he stopped.	O si da duro.
They are late for a holiday.	Wọn ti pẹ fun isinmi kan.
He told the same story last week.	O sọ itan kanna ni ọsẹ to kọja.
Who says the book is irrelevant?	Tani o sọ pe iwe naa ko ṣe pataki?
That's what you see.	Ohun ti o ri niyẹn.
However, as mentioned earlier, this does not seem to work for everyone.	Sibẹsibẹ, bi a ti sọ tẹlẹ, eyi ko dabi pe o ṣiṣẹ fun gbogbo eniyan.
Or in other words, what dogs are designed to be.	Tabi ni awọn ọrọ miiran, kini awọn aja ti a ṣe lati jẹ.
Where life begins.	Nibo ni igbesi aye bẹrẹ.
If you want to know.	Ti o ba fẹ mọ.
In fact, none of us did.	Ni otitọ, ko si ọkan ninu wa ti o ṣe.
We should not say.	A ko yẹ ki o sọ.
He would not have let me go alone.	Ko ba ti jẹ ki mi lọ nikan.
This is only the first day.	Eyi jẹ ọjọ akọkọ nikan.
I do not have time to explain.	Emi ko ni akoko lati ṣe alaye.
It does a good job.	O ni iṣẹ to dara.
Other men could not see.	Awọn ọkunrin miiran ko le ri.
And nothing more can be taken away from him.	Ati pe ko si nkankan diẹ sii ti a le gba lọwọ rẹ.
Now, we have to move.	Ni bayi, a ni lati gbe.
Not in any way, or in any way.	Kii ṣe ni eyikeyi ọna, tabi ni eyikeyi ọna.
I have a son.	Mo ni ọmọ rẹ.
I can do it if you want.	Mo le ṣe ti o ba fẹ.
I read the letter again.	Mo tun ka lẹta naa lẹẹkansi.
It was the last of its kind.	O jẹ ikẹhin ti iru rẹ.
His speech seemed to go down well.	Ọrọ rẹ dabi pe o lọ silẹ daradara.
It is a very specific situation.	O jẹ ipo ti o kan pupọ.
There is nothing like that.	Ko si nkankan bi iyẹn.
Turn off the water.	Pa omi naa.
The train had to stop at its station.	Ọkọ oju irin naa ni lati duro ni ibudo rẹ.
Here we were all.	Nibi ti a gbogbo wà.
I have to get out of here now.	Mo ni lati jade ni ibi bayi.
You are really enjoying your trip.	O n gbadun irin-ajo rẹ gaan.
The trees do not grow much around here.	Awọn igi ko dagba pupọ ni ayika ibi.
Most are themselves.	Pupọ julọ jẹ ara wọn.
That is for other people.	Iyẹn jẹ fun awọn eniyan miiran.
It makes things easier.	O jẹ ki ohun rọrun.
I am not sure of anything in this family.	Emi ko ni idaniloju awọn nkan rara ni idile yii.
I got up in time.	Mo ti gba soke ni akoko.
I will stay here again.	Emi yoo duro nibi lẹẹkansi.
Sometimes it seems like you live in another world.	Nigba miiran o dabi pe o ngbe ni aye miiran.
It is the power of my life.	Agbara aye mi ni.
If you do not sleep, you will not work properly.	Ti o ko ba sun oorun, iwọ kii yoo ṣiṣẹ daradara.
We are completely open to it.	A ti ṣii patapata si.
Even before they were finished, they ate hot food.	Paapaa ṣaaju ki wọn to pari, wọn jẹ ounjẹ ti o gbona.
A lot of people, that is.	Eniyan pupọ, iyẹn.
We look forward to hearing from you.	A n reti lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
We will not, but they will think we will.	A kii yoo, ṣugbọn wọn yoo ro pe a yoo.
They don’t start as they mean to continue.	Wọn ko bẹrẹ bi wọn ṣe tumọ lati tẹsiwaju.
For the first time, it appeared to me.	Fun igba akọkọ, o han mi.
We don’t have that here.	A ko ni iyẹn nibi.
We do not charge.	A ko gba owo.
He surprised the citizens with his wisdom.	O ya awọn ara ilu pẹlu ọgbọn rẹ.
It has been my life.	O ti jẹ aye mi.
Available to everyone.	Wa fun gbogbo eniyan.
That is what we know best.	Iyẹn jẹ ohun ti a mọ dara julọ.
He took two flights out a day.	O si mu meji ofurufu jade ọjọ kan.
All that stuff just goes up, up, up.	Gbogbo nkan yẹn kan lọ soke, soke, soke.
Okay, like, at the same time.	O dara, bii, ni akoko kanna.
In order to do so, you need to eat.	Lati le ṣe bẹ, o nilo lati jẹun.
Go see.	Lọ wo.
And send him a picture of his watch.	Ki o si fi aworan aago rẹ ranṣẹ si i.
But it was certainly hard for that first summer.	Ṣugbọn o daju pe o jẹ lile fun igba ooru akọkọ yẹn.
Call now and give us a try !.	Pe bayi ki o si fun wa kan gbiyanju!.
But the woman has not been with him for a long time.	Ṣugbọn obinrin naa ko wa pẹlu rẹ fun igba pipẹ.
He obviously loves me.	O han gbangba pe o nifẹ si mi.
You let that happen.	O jẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ.
He would not have thought that.	Oun ko ba ti ronu iyẹn.
Things have improved.	Ohun ti dara si.
It was time for bed.	O je akoko fun ibusun.
But my father had no interest in us.	Ṣugbọn baba mi ko ni anfani ninu wa.
Take care of yourself.	Tọju ararẹ.
Give me this clear understanding.	Fun mi eyi han ni oye.
Every child must learn to read and write.	Gbogbo ọmọ gbọdọ kọ ẹkọ lati ka ati kọ.
I hope someone takes my back.	Mo nireti pe eniyan gba ẹhin mi.
But there are good reasons for it.	Ṣugbọn awọn idi ti o dara kan wa fun rẹ.
And they are all there.	Ati pe gbogbo wọn wa.

And evil is my work.	Ati buburu ni iṣẹ mi.
He sat down.	O joko.
Other buildings have changed little.	Awọn ile miiran ti yipada diẹ.
You will get a lot more in this book if you do.	Iwọ yoo gba pupọ diẹ sii ninu iwe yii ti o ba ṣe.
To do what?	Lati ṣe kini?
Or not.	Tabi ko fẹ.
They do not want another winter like the last.	Wọn ko fẹ igba otutu miiran bi ti o kẹhin.

He did not know how to get there.	Ko mọ bi o ṣe de ibi.
More people walked to work that year.	Awọn eniyan diẹ sii rin lati ṣiṣẹ ni ọdun yẹn.

You do not see me.	O ko wo mi.
You did not do it for me.	O ko ṣe fun mi.
It is very beautiful underwater.	O lẹwa pupọ labẹ omi.

There are several reasons for this.	Awọn idi pupọ lo wa fun eyi.
Here, nothing can touch me.	Ni ibi, ko si ohun ti o le fi ọwọ kan mi.
We'll be there in a few minutes.	A yoo wa nibẹ ni iṣẹju diẹ.
I have to go to town for a meeting.	Mo ni lati lọ si ilu fun ipade kan.
We want to be great.	A fẹ lati jẹ nla.
I thought my heart stopped.	Mo ro ọkan mi duro.
Make a day of it.	Ṣe ọjọ kan ti o.
But it is not, and they are not.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ, ati pe wọn kii ṣe.
Please give me the bread.	Jọwọ fun mi ni akara naa.
They always think something is better.	Wọn nigbagbogbo ro pe ohun kan dara julọ.
He was there that day.	O wa nibẹ ni ọjọ yẹn.
This helps a lot.	Eyi ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
He played the players.	O dun awọn ẹrọ orin.
We will see this year.	A o rii ni ọdun yii.
There is no place to go from here.	Ko si ibi lati lọ lati ibi.
You have to find them.	O ni lati wa wọn.
We can't get it.	A ko le gba o.
And it has grown.	Ati pe o ti dagba.
My mother also knew that one day this would happen.	Iya mi tun mọ pe ni ọjọ kan eyi yoo ṣẹlẹ.
We have written about it.	A ti kọ nipa rẹ.
He did not allow such a thing on the ship.	Ko gba laaye iru nkan bẹẹ lori ọkọ oju omi.
Have to.	Ni lati.
Everything is correct.	Ohun gbogbo tọ.
Children jumping around.	Awọn ọmọde ti n fo ni ayika.

He stays out of trouble.	O duro kuro ninu wahala.
Carried out everything.	Ti gbe jade ohun gbogbo.
And not many of us.	Ati pe ko si pupọ ninu wa.
My wife did not know what she was getting.	Iyawo mi ko mọ ohun ti o n gba.
You have a lot of books in your room.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe ninu yara rẹ.
In my company people can run anything.	Ni ile-iṣẹ mi eniyan le ṣiṣe ohunkohun.
Tell me the truth.	Sọ otitọ otitọ fun mi.
Everyone has the wrong information.	Gbogbo eniyan ni awọn alaye ti ko tọ.
There is a place for them.	Ibi kan wa fun wọn.
I don’t think you can take it away with it.	Emi ko ro pe o le mu kuro pẹlu rẹ.
He was in bed and asleep.	O wa lori ibusun o si sun.
I think they will love it.	Mo ro pe wọn yoo nifẹ rẹ.
This is not easy.	Eyi ko rọrun.
No one said what he would do or where he would come from.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ohun ti yoo ṣe tabi ibi ti yoo wa fun u.
The sister was overwhelmed, and did not know why.	Arabinrin naa ti le lori rẹ, ko si mọ idi rẹ.
I also tried to reach my feet.	Mo tun gbiyanju lati de ẹsẹ mi.
Someone important to me has died.	Ẹnikan pataki si mi ti ku.
It is something we have never seen before.	O jẹ ohun ti a ko tii ri tẹlẹ.
That conclusion, of course, did not complete our question.	Ipari yẹn, dajudaju, ko pari ibeere wa.
I was trying to think of something, but, they were high.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ronu nkan, ṣugbọn, wọn ga.
Now he is no longer a boy.	Bayi ko jẹ ọmọkunrin mọ.
It seems wrong.	O dabi aṣiṣe.
You are better than me.	O dara ju mi ​​lọ.
I can't find a way out of it.	Emi ko ri ọna kan jade ninu rẹ.
There is a big accident.	Ijamba nla kan wa.
It does not matter how.	Ko ṣe pataki bawo ni.
But know this.	Ṣugbọn mọ eyi.
But that, too, can be written.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn, paapaa, ni a le kọ.
I'll just go upstairs.	Emi yoo lọ soke nikan.
It’s too much, maybe too much.	O jẹ pupọ, boya pupọ ju.
I will do anything for you if you want.	Emi yoo ṣe ohunkohun fun ọ ti o ba fẹ.
We can get that back.	A le gba iyẹn pada.
But wait, he said.	Ṣugbọn duro, o sọ.
Maybe now you can apply.	Boya ni bayi o le kan.
This is not very much in his books, however.	Eyi ko wa pupọ ninu awọn iwe rẹ, sibẹsibẹ.
Maybe even your father.	Boya paapaa baba rẹ.
I need to see you.	Mo nilo lati ri ọ.
That's right.	Iyẹn tọ.
Something is going down.	Nkankan n lọ si isalẹ.
Maybe they can’t think of anything better to do.	Boya wọn ko le ronu ohunkohun ti o dara julọ lati ṣe.
Don't make up.	Maṣe ṣe soke.
He looked at his watch with anxiety.	O wo aago rẹ pẹlu aniyan.
I will continue to help you there.	Emi yoo tẹsiwaju lati ran ọ lọwọ nibẹ.
Or at least for an hour or so it is.	Tabi o kere ju fun wakati kan tabi bẹ o jẹ.
I didn’t know he would do so.	Emi ko mọ pe yoo ṣe bẹ.
He does not think that anything is wrong.	Ko ni ero pe ohunkohun ko tọ.
And, of course that’s just one side.	Ati pe, dajudaju iyẹn jẹ ẹgbẹ kan nikan.
Even back before.	Paapaa pada ṣaaju ki o to.
I think he let me.	Mo ro pe o jẹ ki mi.
He could not be.	Ko le jẹ oun.
You are gone in time.	O ti lọ kuro ni akoko.
Not so with values.	Kii ṣe bẹ pẹlu awọn iye.
Not just your eyes.	Kii ṣe oju rẹ nikan.
The other man seemed to be talking to himself.	Ọkunrin miiran dabi ẹni pe o n ba ara rẹ sọrọ.
Everyone has something or someone they care about.	Gbogbo eniyan ni nkankan tabi ẹnikan ti wọn ṣe aniyan nipa.
Just what both asked.	O kan ohun ti awọn mejeeji beere.
What it is we do not know.	Ohun ti o jẹ a ko mọ.
I let them get it.	Mo jẹ ki wọn gba.
Her mother is here.	Iya rẹ wa nibi.
Do not cross the road.	Maṣe kọja ni opopona.
Tell me when it is finished.	Sọ fun mi nigbati o ba ti pari.
We begin to find ourselves.	A bẹrẹ lati wa ara wa.
It is not old, it is not new.	Kii ṣe ti atijọ, kii ṣe tuntun.
She is a sister.	Arabinrin ni.
Okay, but this is not good.	O dara, ṣugbọn kii ṣe eyi dara.
You just can't say the same for them right now.	O kan ko le sọ kanna fun wọn ni bayi.
Okay, not easy.	O dara, ko rọrun.
This boat looks like a city.	Ọkọ oju omi yii dabi ilu kan.
And it was good.	Ati pe o ti dara.
He died in less than two hours.	O ku ni kere ju wakati meji.
Can anyone help please ?.	Ṣe ẹnikẹni le ṣe iranlọwọ jọwọ?.
And there are many.	Ati pe ọpọlọpọ wa.
It was a thing.	O je ohun.
Okay, don’t forget, that was a long time ago.	O dara, maṣe gbagbe, iyẹn jẹ igba pipẹ sẹhin.
I have seen every single one of them pass me by.	Mo ti ri gbogbo ọkan ninu wọn kọja mi.
It is in a beautiful location.	O wa ni ipo ti o lẹwa.
You can lose.	O le padanu.
The child is afraid of dogs.	Ọmọ naa bẹru awọn aja.
Whether it will buy or not.	Boya yoo ra tabi ko ni.
About who it may be we do not know.	Nipa ẹniti o le jẹ gaan a ko mọ.
Not when they walk, not when they eat.	Kii ṣe nigba ti wọn rin, kii ṣe nigbati wọn jẹun.
They were caught in a big accident.	Wọn mu ninu ijamba nla kan.
You’re thinking that maybe you need one.	O n ronu pe boya o nilo ọkan.
Everyone looks the other way.	Gbogbo eniyan wo ni ọna miiran.
The sister is getting better now, but not well yet.	Arabinrin naa ti n dara si ni bayi, ṣugbọn ko dara sibẹsibẹ.
I can't put them in.	Emi ko le fi wọn sinu.
Not in an obvious way.	Kii ṣe ni ọna ti o han gbangba.

Very nice to come.	O dara pupọ lati wa.
But even a child can think.	Ṣugbọn paapaa ọmọde le ronu.

I meet him now.	Mo pade rẹ ni bayi.
But running for office is good by me.	Ṣugbọn ṣiṣe fun ọfiisi dara nipasẹ mi.
Did you enjoy the meal?	Ṣe o gbadun ounjẹ naa?
After several minutes he found out.	Lẹhin awọn iṣẹju pupọ o rii.
In this way, he said.	Ni ọna yii, o sọ.
One word can say a lot.	Ọrọ kan le sọ pupọ.
No special program, you know.	Ko si eto pataki, o mọ.
She turned to her mother.	O yipada si iya rẹ.
But no one will believe it.	Ṣugbọn ko si ọkan yoo gbagbọ rẹ.
It really means.	O tumọ si ni otitọ.
I think my kids might like this.	Mo ro pe awọn ọmọ mi le fẹ eyi.
Citizens welcomed the book.	Awọn ara ilu gba iwe naa daradara.
You have to go after him.	O ni lati lọ lẹhin rẹ.
I can be honest with myself now.	Mo le jẹ otitọ ara mi ni bayi.
I'll stay now.	Emi yoo duro ni bayi.
You may have been there for a week.	O le ti wa nibẹ fun ọsẹ kan.
Don't give up.	Maṣe fun ni.
At night, someone came home.	Ni alẹ, ẹnikan wa si ile.
They take good care of it.	Wọn tọju rẹ daradara.
We are old friends.	A jẹ awọn ọrẹ atijọ.
But maybe it's worth it.	Ṣugbọn boya o tọ.
But it is better than that.	Ṣugbọn o dara ju iyẹn lọ.
We will work in a week.	A yoo ṣiṣẹ ni ọsẹ kan.
It will be some time before the water runs out.	Yoo jẹ akoko diẹ ṣaaju ki omi naa to lọ.
I have never been able to explain it.	Emi ko ti le ṣe alaye rẹ rara.
No special equipment or clothing required. 	Ko si ohun elo pataki tabi aṣọ ti a beere.

Breakfast is good.	Ounjẹ owurọ dara.
I usually use the simplest method.	Mo maa lo ọna ti o rọrun julọ.
I did not go to school.	Emi ko lọ si ile-iwe.
They look more like us.	Wọn dabi wa diẹ sii.
I started talking.	Mo bẹrẹ si sọrọ.
I lost my parents, I lost my wife and children.	Mo padanu awọn obi mi, o padanu iyawo ati awọn ọmọ rẹ.
When she said she wanted to be human, her parents laughed.	Nigbati o sọ pe o fẹ lati jẹ eniyan, awọn obi rẹ rẹrin.
Let me see you, touch you.	Jẹ ki n ri ọ, fi ọwọ kan ọ.
It is not my place.	Kii ṣe aaye mi.
Of course, it does not work.	Dajudaju, ko ṣiṣẹ.
He does not understand.	Ko ṣe oye.
Take a break for a while due to other obligations.	Mu isinmi fun diẹ nitori awọn adehun miiran.
He stopped walking.	O duro rin.
Now give me a name.	Bayi fun mi ni orukọ.
Sometimes things don’t work out.	Nigba miiran awọn nkan ko ṣiṣẹ.

Everyone loves to have friends to learn together.	Gbogbo eniyan nifẹ lati ni awọn ọrẹ lati kọ ẹkọ papọ.
The last male group will play again.	Ẹgbẹ ọkunrin ti o kẹhin yoo tun ṣiṣẹ lẹẹkansi.
And it will not be easy.	Ati pe kii yoo rọrun.
Therefore	Nitorina
I have a friend who is going through that right now.	Mo ni ọrẹ kan ti n lọ nipasẹ iyẹn ni bayi.
At least the tallest dogs.	O kere ju awọn aja ti o ga julọ.
We will of course do something with our lives.	A yoo dajudaju ṣe ohun kan pẹlu awọn aye wa.

Knowledge and truth.	Mọ ati otitọ.
Or, it should be so.	Tabi, o yẹ ki o jẹ bẹ.
Nothing else matters to him.	Ko si ohun miiran ọrọ fun u.
He brought it back.	O mu u pada.
He did not raise his hand to stop me.	Ko gbe ọwọ kan lati da mi duro.
They don't seem to stop and look at what happened.	Ko dabi pe wọn duro ti wọn wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
I'm glad you are here today.	Inu mi dun pe o wa nibi loni.

For most of my friends, it’s easy.	Fun pupọ julọ awọn ọrẹ mi, o rọrun.

But there is an accident.	Ṣugbọn ijamba kan wa.
I played my hand, which was not a good thing.	Mo ti dun ọwọ mi, eyi ti o je ko kan ti o dara.
It, in fact, depends on what you want to do.	O, ni otitọ, da lori ohun ti o fẹ ṣe.
Out with them.	Jade pẹlu wọn.
It tests the strength of the material.	O ṣe idanwo agbara ohun elo naa.
Things get interesting here.	Ohun gba awon nibi.
But it is not the same as that.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe kanna bi iyẹn.
However it worked.	Sibẹsibẹ o ṣiṣẹ.
No, he has not heard from you.	Rara, ko tii gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
He did not eat.	O ko jẹun.
She has loved her husband and her life.	O ti nifẹ ọkọ rẹ ati igbesi aye rẹ.
Everything we say to him can be true.	Gbogbo ohun ti a sọ si i le jẹ otitọ.
Will sell your car, lose a lot in the game.	Yoo ta ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ, padanu pupọ ninu ere naa.
That is not true.	Iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
And kids can make their own people.	Ati pe awọn ọmọde le ṣe awọn eniyan ti ara wọn.
I have thought about it a lot.	Mo ti ro nipa rẹ pupo.
Don't say no.	Maṣe sọ pe o ko.
Maybe it doesn’t have to be money.	Boya ko ni lati jẹ owo.
And dogs.	Ati awọn aja.
And sleep late in the morning.	Ati ki o sun pẹ ni owurọ.
But this is the life we ​​have to live, only one.	Ṣugbọn eyi ni igbesi aye ti a ni lati gbe, ọkan nikan.
After only a short time	Lẹhin igba diẹ nikan
Accept it, accept it, be with it.	Gba, gba a, wa pẹlu rẹ.
Of course you have seen.	Dajudaju o ti ri.
For the first time it worked well.	Fun igba akọkọ o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
Not if you want to be alive.	Kii ṣe ti o ba fẹ wa laaye.
I want to see.	Mo fe ri.
Do not say too much in front of him.	Maṣe sọ pupọ ni iwaju rẹ.
The phone is ringing.	Foonu naa n dun.
Maybe not a good idea.	Boya kii ṣe imọran to dara.
I think one lost his leg.	Mo ro pe ọkan padanu ẹsẹ rẹ.
I can feel it now.	Mo le rilara bayi.
I can't find a soul.	Nko ri emi kan ri.
He died in a car accident.	O ku ninu ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
And that will be yours.	Ati pe iyẹn yoo jẹ tirẹ.
They did well and changed themselves.	Wọn ṣe daradara ati yi ara wọn pada.
We have good services.	A ni awọn iṣẹ to dara.
I know it will change.	Mo mọ pe yoo yipada.
At least not yet.	O kere ko sibẹsibẹ.
But it's good.	Sugbon o dara.
You can have some and go.	O le ni diẹ ninu ki o lọ.
There is nothing else you can do.	Ko si ohun miiran ti o le ṣe.
There are two kinds of love.	Iru ife meji lo wa.
We were left with the problem of what to do.	A fi wa silẹ pẹlu iṣoro ti kini lati ṣe.
You will never see me again.	Iwọ kii yoo ri mi mọ.
There they are, almost enough now.	Nibẹ ni wọn tun wa, o fẹrẹ to wa ni bayi.
So you probably don’t know any better.	Nitorina o ṣee ṣe pe ko mọ eyikeyi ti o dara julọ.
But they need money.	Ṣugbọn wọn nilo owo.
That’s what they’ve changed.	Iyẹn ni wọn ti yipada.
At that moment, it was just a door.	Ni akoko yẹn, o kan ilẹkun.
It is raining today.	Ojo nla ni oni.
Turn off the phone.	Pa foonu naa.

It should have grown now.	O yẹ ki o ti dagba ni bayi.
Or you have what it looks like.	Tabi ti o ni ohun ti o dabi.
Very good.	O dara pupọ.
I cannot continue like this.	Emi ko le tẹsiwaju bi eleyi.

He’s convinced right now.	O ni idaniloju ni bayi.

You need to get some of the skills you have.	O nilo lati gba diẹ ninu awọn ọgbọn ti o ni.
My friend's father died last week.	Baba ọrẹ mi ku ni ọsẹ to kọja.

See this picture.	Wo aworan yii.
Your leg is injured.	Ẹsẹ rẹ ni ipalara.

What one type needs is not the same with another type.	Ohun ti iru kan nilo kii ṣe iru pẹlu iru miiran.
I want to be able to touch.	Mo fẹ lati ni anfani lati fi ọwọ kan.
The mother and daughter are enjoying themselves.	Iya ati ọmọbirin naa n gbadun ara wọn.
We have a good opportunity to sell our house.	Anfani to dara wa ti a fe ta ile wa.
He is not that.	Oun kii ṣe iyẹn.
Make sure you go down on your first.	Rii daju pe o lọ si isalẹ lori rẹ akọkọ.
Is life worth living?	Njẹ igbesi aye yẹ lati gbe bi?
Either way, it would be stressful if someone knew.	Ọna boya, yoo jẹ wahala ti ẹnikan ba mọ.
And so another week has passed.	Ati bẹ ọsẹ miiran ti kọja.
I'm not sure.	Emi ko da mi loju.
Anything will do to get started.	Ohunkohun yoo ṣe lati bẹrẹ.
They do not need money.	Wọn ko nilo owo.

He thought he would never see the picture again.	O ro pe ko ni ri aworan naa mọ.
This is now.	Eyi ni bayi.
And yet he did not buy.	Ati sibẹsibẹ o ko ra.
A simple test can help us to understand this.	Idanwo ti o rọrun le ṣe iranlọwọ fun wa lati loye eyi.
They are the same person.	Wọn jẹ eniyan kanna.
One has to know how to do it well.	Eniyan kan ni lati mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe daradara.
I want them to be at that time.	Mo fẹ ki wọn wa ni akoko naa.
I could feel on and off all day.	Mo le ni rilara lori ati pa ni gbogbo ọjọ naa.
In the future, cars will operate on fire.	Ni ojo iwaju, awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yoo ṣiṣẹ lori ina.

The man was a driver.	Ọkunrin naa ni awakọ.

But this did not happen at all.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko ṣẹlẹ rara.
It is just as tasty.	O ti wa ni o kan bi dun.
It is felt by everyone.	O jẹ rilara nipasẹ gbogbo eniyan.
You can stay the night, if you want.	O le duro ni alẹ, ti o ba fẹ.

Some of them are hard to come by.	Diẹ ninu wọn jẹ lile lati de.
If the girl looks young, she is not her sister.	Ti ọmọbirin naa ba dabi ọdọ, kii ṣe arabinrin rẹ.
None of your friends will take any money.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ọrẹ rẹ ti yoo ya a eyikeyi owo.
You have won a room in the house.	O ti gba yara kan ninu ile.
They do things.	Wọn ṣe awọn nkan.

If you have any problems, please contact us.	Ti o ba ni awọn iṣoro eyikeyi, jọwọ kan si wa.
You need to wear some clothes.	O nilo lati wọ diẹ ninu awọn aṣọ.
This is probably what you want.	Eleyi jẹ jasi ohun ti o fẹ.
In my time, we had no electricity.	Ni akoko mi, a ko ni ina.
I do not know what you see in a man like me.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o ri ninu ọkunrin kan bi emi.
No one knows much about it.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ pupọ nipa rẹ.

As it was another game.	Bi o ti jẹ ere miiran.

But we will not leave yet.	Ṣugbọn a ko ni lọ kuro sibẹsibẹ.
But that's just on the street.	Sugbon ti o ni o kan lori ita.
Maybe you thought so.	Boya o ti ro o.
They look and feel great.	Wọn wo ati rilara nla.
It's time for the car to go well.	O to akoko ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa ti lọ daradara.
Do you have to.	Ṣe o gbọdọ.
Some of us have been there.	Diẹ ninu wa ti wa nibẹ.

That is the rules of this game.	Iyẹn ni awọn ofin ti ere yii.
It can be a game we can enjoy.	O le jẹ ere ti a le gbadun.
At least for the night.	Ni o kere fun alẹ.
This makes the lower classes happy, of course.	Eleyi mu ki awọn kekere kilasi dun, dajudaju.

It is for the best.	O jẹ fun awọn ti o dara ju.
You can talk to him.	O le ba a sọrọ.
You can talk me down.	O le sọrọ mi si isalẹ.
There must be a way to stop this from happening.	Ọna kan gbọdọ wa lati da eyi duro lati ṣẹlẹ.
All this, of course, is true.	Gbogbo eyi, dajudaju, jẹ otitọ.
It is very surprising.	O jẹ iyalẹnu pupọ.
But other students may not remember this at all.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọmọ ile-iwe miiran ko le ranti eyi rara.
He went back inside and returned to his family.	O pada si inu o si yipada si idile rẹ.
The house was originally intended as a store.	Ile naa ti pinnu ni akọkọ bi ile itaja kan.
I couldn’t seem to stop myself.	Emi ko le dabi lati da ara mi duro.
Very easy to read.	Pupọ ni o rọrun lati ka.

Accidents have to be expected.	Awọn ijamba ni lati nireti.
He wrote of his own.	O kọ ti tirẹ.
Eat a little.	Je kekere kan.
There are a few possible reasons for this.	Awọn idi diẹ ti o ṣee ṣe fun eyi.
You will have to wait for another two days.	Iwọ yoo ni lati duro fun ọjọ meji miiran.

Not only in and out.	Ko nikan ni ati ki o jade.
The end of a great thing.	Ipari ohun nla.

Do you want it to stay?	Ṣe o fẹ ki o duro?
Keep track of what your heart is doing.	Tọju ohun ti ọkan rẹ n ṣe.
When you go to bed.	Nigbati o lọ si ibusun.
I am happy about it.	Inu mi dun nipa rẹ.
That may be true for some communities.	Iyẹn le jẹ otitọ fun awọn agbegbe kan.
Water is not visible to human eyes.	Omi omi ko han si oju eniyan.
Now people are asked to go again and again.	Bayi a beere awọn eniyan lati lọ lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
I don’t know what to do about that.	Emi ko mọ kini lati ṣe nipa iyẹn.
He wanted to go home.	O fe lati lọ si ile.
I think it's really good.	Mo ro pe o dara gaan.
Very small, and so, very beautiful.	O kere pupọ, ati bẹ, o lẹwa pupọ.
They are faster than fire.	Wọn yara ju ina lọ.
Her fine hair is stuck in place.	Irun rẹ daradara ti di ni aaye.
That is not enough.	Iyẹn ko le to.
All the girls were arrested.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọbirin ni wọn mu.
Not with me on it, yourself.	Kii ṣe pẹlu mi lori rẹ, funrararẹ.
He will not talk about the past.	Oun kii yoo sọrọ nipa ohun ti o ti kọja.
It doesn't matter where you put it.	Ko ṣe pataki ibi ti o fi sii.
That kind of injury.	Iru ipalara naa.
And he too.	Ati oun naa.
Made by his father who is not here.	Ṣe nipasẹ baba rẹ ti o ni ko nibi.
The rooms are too big.	Awọn yara jẹ nla ju.
Couldn’t have been better than ourselves.	Ko le ti sọ ti o dara ju ara wa.
You will have to get it from them.	Iwọ yoo ni lati gba lati ọdọ wọn.
Or music.	Tabi orin.
There is no body.	Ko si ara.
He used that word a lot.	O lo ọrọ yẹn pupọ.
And there are a lot of people who want it done.	Ati pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan wa ti o fẹ ki o ṣe.
Do less and less.	Ṣe kere ati kere si.
And at this point we try to do the same thing.	Ati ni aaye yii a gbiyanju lati ṣe ohun kanna.
Nothing has changed.	Ko si ohun ti o yipada.
A thought does not sound like a good thing physically.	Ero kan ko dabi ohun ti o dara ti ara.
You will use them regularly.	Iwọ yoo lo wọn nigbagbogbo.
I would also like to visit him, you know.	Emi yoo tun fẹ lati ṣabẹwo si i, o mọ.

However, this did not happen.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi ko ṣẹlẹ.
This is the method adopted in this book.	Eyi ni ọna ti a gba ninu iwe yii.
They are looking for a car.	Wọn wa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
She is a very sweet girl.	O jẹ ọmọbirin ti o dun pupọ.

Everyone understands the same thing.	Gbogbo eniyan loye ohun kanna.
I can’t understand much about that.	Emi ko le ni oye pupọ nipa iyẹn.
Can you tell me how to get there?	Ṣe o le sọ fun mi bi o ṣe le de ibudo naa?
Usually, that is the woman.	Nigbagbogbo, iyẹn ni obinrin naa.
No words were spoken for a while.	Ko si ọrọ kan ti a sọ fun igba diẹ.
If you need anything.	Ti o ba nilo ohunkohun.
I don’t want to say what’s going on in my mind.	Emi ko fẹ lati sọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ ninu ọkan mi.
One way out.	Ọna kan jade.
At first, no one.	Ni akọkọ, ko si ẹnikan.
Or you can.	Tabi o le.
I will write the story.	Emi yoo kọ itan naa.
If they like them, you will too.	Ti wọn ba fẹran wọn, iwọ yoo tun.
The eyes you see are past everything you can’t.	Awọn oju ti o ri ti o ti kọja ohun gbogbo ti o ko ba le.
Remember them, all.	Ranti wọn, gbogbo.
That is the point.	Aaye yii ni iyẹn.
It's not easy to raise a child alone.	O ni ko rọrun lati tọ ọmọ nikan.
There was so little to see.	Nibẹ wà ki kekere lati ri.
If you are good with low performance, you pay less.	Ti o ba dara pẹlu iṣẹ ṣiṣe kekere, o san kere si.
You have done it for yourself.	O ti ṣe fun ara rẹ.
What if there is no tomorrow?	Kini ti ko ba si ọla?

The machines make sense.	Awọn ẹrọ ṣe oye.
Not in the least.	Kii ṣe ninu awọn ti o kere julọ.
I will never try again.	Emi kii yoo gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
They can’t be wrong.	Wọn ko le ṣe aṣiṣe.
Can you pick me up at the train station?	Ṣe o le gbe mi ni ibudo ọkọ oju irin?
Do not use names.	Maṣe lo awọn orukọ.
We do not see that at this point.	A ko rii iyẹn ni aaye yii.
You may know it, or it may be too young.	O le mọ ọ, tabi o le jẹ ọdọ ju.
It’s not always what it seems.	Kii ṣe nigbagbogbo ohun ti o dabi gbangba.
Of course, it must be tomorrow, especially.	Dajudaju, o gbọdọ wa ni ọla, paapaa.
I learn a lot about the law every time we meet.	Mo kọ ẹkọ pupọ nipa ofin ni gbogbo igba ti a ba pade.
Spend some time on your desk.	Lo akoko diẹ lori tabili rẹ.
He will be very good.	Oun yoo dara gaan.
We do not have to make this decision.	A ko ni lati ṣe ipinnu yii.
Okay, now is our time.	O dara, bayi o jẹ akoko wa.
I could not bring myself to touch it.	Emi ko le mu ara mi lati fi ọwọ kan rẹ.

And if not, you should try at least.	Ati pe ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, o yẹ ki o gbiyanju o kere ju.

He will need me.	Oun yoo nilo mi.
I would like to help you.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ran ọ lọwọ.
But before you go, let me tell you something.	Ṣugbọn ṣaaju ki o to lọ, jẹ ki n sọ nkan kan fun ọ.
Nothing in and nothing out.	Ko si nkankan ninu ati ohunkohun jade.
It has a lot.	O ni pupọ.
Often you do not know who they are.	Nigbagbogbo iwọ ko mọ ẹni ti wọn jẹ.
Contact us today !.	Kan si wa loni!.
You can not wait anymore.	O ko le duro mọ.
Do we all agree?	Ṣe gbogbo wa gba?
I was known to make names for such a thing.	A mọ mi lati ṣe awọn orukọ fun iru nkan bẹẹ.
I did everything that was expected of me.	Mo ti ṣe ohun gbogbo ti a reti lati mi.
They knew each other from high school.	Wọn mọ ara wọn lati ile-iwe giga.
You say anything else you want to do in life, you can.	O sọ ohunkohun miiran ti o fẹ lati ṣe ni igbesi aye, o le.
It all seems pretty well done.	Gbogbo rẹ dabi lẹwa daradara ṣe.
But he misunderstood the whole situation.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe aṣiṣe gbogbo ipo naa.
I can give you your voice back.	Mo le fun ọ ni ohun rẹ pada.
I have so much to tell you.	Mo ni pupọ lati sọ fun ọ.

This is not important.	Eyi kii ṣe pataki.
I am with him now, at this time.	Mo wa pẹlu rẹ ni bayi, ni akoko yii.
And he came and he knew.	Ati pe o wa ati pe o mọ.
Problems in education in this area are very important.	Awọn iṣoro ni ẹkọ ni agbegbe yii jẹ pataki pupọ.
You will have to sort out and sell it.	O yoo ni lati to awọn jade ki o si ta o.
Time has passed.	Akoko kan ti kọja.

The two are always together.	Awọn mejeeji wa nigbagbogbo papọ.
He or she has good ideas.	Oun tabi obinrin ni awọn imọran to dara.
He has no interest in them.	Ko si ni anfani wọn.
This thing stopped.	Nkan yi duro.
They left after a while.	Wọn lọ kuro lẹhin igba diẹ.
The sister did not come down with anything.	Arabinrin ko wa ni isalẹ pẹlu ohunkohun.
If you sell a lot, you do a lot.	Ti o ba ta pupọ, o ṣe pupọ.
Her eyes are wide open.	Oju rẹ jẹ gidigidi.
But maybe it was less interesting than that.	Sugbon boya o je kere awon ju ti.
This is about a member who is here right now.	Eyi jẹ nipa ọmọ ẹgbẹ kan ti o wa nibi ni bayi.
I live in the city now.	Mo n gbe ni ilu ni bayi.
I pull hard on him like you.	Mo fa lile lori rẹ bi rẹ.
People still live with hunger.	Eniyan si n gbe pẹlu ebi.

He did not return home until after two.	Ko tun pada wa si ile titi lẹhin meji.

Went into the office one morning.	Ti lọ sinu ọfiisi ni owurọ kan.
We have no friends here.	A ko ni awọn ọrẹ nibi.

Fathers today spend a lot of time at work.	Awọn baba loni lo akoko pupọ ni iṣẹ.
I don't know what it is.	Ko mọ iru ti o jẹ.
Maybe you don’t think about them.	Boya o ko ronu nipa wọn.
He can't call you.	Ko le pe e.
So, what can you do to help the environment?	Nitorina, kini o le ṣe lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun ayika naa?
You have said so.	O ti sọ bẹ.
They are trying to be good for themselves and those around them.	Wọn n gbiyanju lati dara fun ara wọn ati awọn ti o wa ni ayika wọn.
Students will bring gifts for the teacher.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe yoo mu ẹbun fun olukọ.
And, say.	Ati, sọ.
He arrived, and left the rope.	O de, o fi okun naa silẹ.

Do not eat at that table.	Maṣe jẹun ni tabili yẹn.
So this picture.	Nitorina aworan yii.
I asked him today.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ loni.
It tastes good to eat.	O dun lati jẹun.
He waited for his day.	O duro de ọjọ rẹ.
In other words, he killed himself.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, o pa ara ẹni.
There is something about music that brings out the best in people.	Nibẹ ni nkankan nipa orin ti o mu jade ti o dara ju ninu awọn eniyan.
I can't stop anymore.	Emi ko le da duro mọ.
He was a boy who lost his father.	O jẹ ọmọkunrin kan ti o padanu baba rẹ.
Okay, now you know.	O dara, ni bayi o mọ.
This is physical or biological.	Eyi ni ti ara tabi ti ibi.
Some years are better than others.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọdun dara ju awọn miiran lọ.
It is not my job.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ mi.
They help a lot.	Wọn ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
We think it is impossible for that to happen.	A ro pe ko ṣee ṣe fun iyẹn lati ṣẹlẹ.
She is there for her son.	O ti wa nibẹ fun ọmọ rẹ.

Something has to change.	Nkankan ni lati yipada.
Suffice it to say, it works.	O to lati sọ, o ṣiṣẹ.
Maybe you will even like it.	Boya o yoo paapaa fẹran rẹ.
He hopes he may die.	O nireti pe o le ku.
You don’t expect any words from him.	O ko reti eyikeyi ọrọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
Probably the easiest way to go.	O ṣee ṣe ọna ti o rọrun julọ lati lọ.
No, he did not.	Rara, ko ṣe bẹ.
I just don’t see that happening.	Emi ko kan rii pe n ṣẹlẹ.
You will not need them.	Iwọ kii yoo nilo wọn.
None of us want to go through this.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa ti o fẹ lati lọ nipasẹ eyi.
He sat down, said nothing.	O joko, ko so nkankan.

Some children refuse to go to school.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọde kọ lati lọ si ile-iwe.
We visited all the important places.	A ṣabẹwo si gbogbo awọn aaye pataki.
Turn them upside down.	Yi wọn soke.

You can use both correctly.	O le lo awọn mejeeji ni otitọ.

He, in particular, was asleep but little.	Oun, paapaa, ti sun ṣugbọn jẹ diẹ.
We arrived an hour late for school.	A de wakati kan pẹ fun ile-iwe.
He will not be punished.	A ko ni fi iya ba a.

It will be removed in a few minutes.	Yoo yọ kuro ni iṣẹju diẹ.
We have a lot of meetings.	A ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ipade.
We did not find anything you asked for.	A ko ri nkan ti o beere.
If you want to do better, you can.	Ti o ba fẹ ṣe dara julọ, o le.
If you die, there is no way.	Ti o ba ku, ko si ọna.
It took a long time.	O si mu gun gun.
Everyone else will want you to go.	Gbogbo eniyan miiran yoo fẹ ki o lọ.
Sure you expect so.	O daju pe o nireti bẹ.
I can go to a higher life.	Mo le lo si igbesi aye giga.
The rainy season is over.	Igba ojo ti pari.
In the past, it was very simple.	Ni igba atijọ, o rọrun pupọ.
I will tell my story better tomorrow.	Emi yoo sọ itan mi dara julọ ni ọla.
The man knew how to tell a story.	Ọkunrin naa mọ bi a ṣe le sọ itan kan.

I mean you feel like that.	Mo tumọ si pe inu rẹ dun bi iyẹn.
You want to do so, fine with me.	O fẹ lati ṣe bẹ, o dara pẹlu mi.
The house is beautiful.	Ile jẹ lẹwa.
Every home should have one.	Gbogbo ile yẹ ki o ni ọkan.
That's enough, sister.	Iyẹn ti to, arabinrin.
We know we are beautiful.	A mọ pe a lẹwa.

If you still have any.	Ti o ba tun ni eyikeyi.
It is a test.	O jẹ idanwo.
People are saying what they will.	Awọn eniyan n sọ ohun ti wọn yoo.
I think they have written it down.	Mo ro pe wọn ti kọ ọ silẹ.
I'm very happy.	Inu mi dun pupo.
Captured in that position you can do one of two things.	Ti mu ni ipo yẹn o le ṣe ọkan ninu awọn nkan meji.
Such, at least, is the report made on this issue.	Iru, o kere ju, ni iroyin ti a ṣe lori ọrọ yii.
Does anyone have a key?	Ṣe ẹnikẹni ni bọtini kan?
I would like that.	Emi yoo fẹ iyẹn.
Marriage will be the most expensive.	Igbeyawo yoo jẹ iye owo julọ.
The work surprised me when I reached it.	Iṣẹ naa ku mi nigbati mo de ọdọ rẹ.
Everything was written out in about two to three weeks.	A kọ ohun gbogbo jade ni bii ọsẹ meji si mẹta.
And it is not the person who wants to find you.	Ati pe kii ṣe eniyan ti o fẹ lati wa ọ.
You have wanted this for so long.	O ti fẹ eyi fun igba pipẹ bẹ.
You do not really want to live forever.	O ko gan fẹ lati gbe lailai.

But they know.	Ṣugbọn wọn mọ.
And this is your site.	Ati aaye rẹ yii.
He promised to keep his mouth shut.	O ṣe ileri lati pa ẹnu rẹ mọ.
You can have this on me.	O le ni eyi lori mi.
Many of them died where they left off.	Ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn ku ni ibi ti wọn duro.
And yet one does not see it as true.	Ati pe sibẹsibẹ ọkan ko rii bi otitọ.
Many of them let you into the work class.	Pupọ ninu wọn jẹ ki o wa sinu kilasi iṣẹ.
We were there.	A wà nibẹ.
Not as it was last night.	Ko bi o ti wà kẹhin alẹ.
That is the most important reason.	Idi pataki julọ niyẹn.
I was there, baby.	Mo ti wa nibẹ, ọmọ.
Do not try to say that it has changed since then.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati sọ pe o ti yipada lati igba naa.
No one knows how it will go.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ bi yoo ṣe lọ.
You should bring some trees completely.	O yẹ ki o mu awọn igi kan wa patapata.
They find it impossible to continue working.	Wọn rii pe ko ṣee ṣe lati tẹsiwaju iṣẹ.

Don’t get around to explain your mistake.	Ko gba ni ayika lati ṣe alaye aṣiṣe rẹ.
Feeling very small.	Rilara gan kekere.
There is a small celebration on the tenth day.	Ayẹyẹ kekere wa ni ọjọ kẹwa.

She told my mother that she could not continue for a long time.	O sọ fun iya mi pe ko le tẹsiwaju fun igba pipẹ.
No final decisions were made.	Ko si awọn ipinnu ikẹhin ti a ṣe.
It's just my body.	Ara mi kan ni.
Anyone with any ideas.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ba ni ero eyikeyi.
You do not remember doing anything special.	O ko ranti ṣe ohunkohun pataki.
Members of the group soon left.	Awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti ẹgbẹ laipẹ lọ kuro.

Some of them have one.	Diẹ ninu wọn ni ọkan.

He just can't talk to the man.	O kan ko le ba ọkunrin naa sọrọ.
As in, old.	Bi ninu, atijọ.
Tell you what, that's not it.	Sọ fun ọ kini, iyẹn kii ṣe bẹẹ.
Everyone seems to be looking for an explanation.	Gbogbo eniyan dabi ẹni pe o wa alaye kan.
They look like this.	Wọn dabi eyi.
Buy their stuff.	Ra nkan wọn.
But nothing there.	Ṣugbọn ko si nkankan nibẹ.
I don't want to take this.	Emi ko fẹ lati mu eyi.
The sister was very nice.	Arabinrin naa dara dara.
It almost looks like home.	O fẹrẹ dabi ile.
Worried about something.	Ni aniyan nipa nkankan.
Maybe not your wife, at least that's how you look at me.	Boya kii ṣe iyawo rẹ, o kere ju iyẹn ni bi o ṣe rii si mi.
There are so many.	Nibẹ ni ki ọpọlọpọ awọn.
As you can see.	Bi o ti ri.
I did not ask you to do that!	Emi ko beere lọwọ rẹ lati ṣe iyẹn!
It used to run.	O lo lati ṣiṣe.
Life is not as simple as it used to be.	Igbesi aye ko rọrun bi o ti jẹ tẹlẹ.
Let’s see what’s up here.	Jẹ ki a wo ohun ti o wa nibi.
It was the company they bought out.	O jẹ ile-iṣẹ ti wọn ra jade.
I don't like that.	Emi ko fẹran iyẹn.
We are like brothers.	A dabi awọn arakunrin.
You will not be there anymore.	O ko ni wa nibẹ mọ.
Want to come here.	Fẹ lati wa si ibi.
If it sounds, say so.	Ti o ba dun, sọ bẹ.
I will be on my way.	Emi yoo wa ni ọna mi.
It was not his style.	O je ko rẹ ara.
You know how good it already is.	O mọ bi o ṣe dara ti tẹlẹ.
Repeat this forever.	Tun eyi ṣe lailai.
Everyone is watching.	Gbogbo eniyan n wo.
You've said a lot.	O ti sọ pupọ.
I do not know where it came from.	Emi ko mọ ibiti o ti wa.
They may not be alive.	Wọn le ma wa laaye.
They must find another way.	Wọn gbọdọ wa ọna miiran.
We did not go back.	A ko pada sẹhin.
Both parents died early.	Awọn obi mejeeji ku ni kutukutu.
But the words are not there.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọrọ ko si nibẹ.
And the food is, the same as ever.	Ati awọn ounjẹ ni, kanna bi lailai.
However, these systems have small capabilities.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ọna ṣiṣe wọnyi ni awọn agbara kekere.
Maybe we can take up to two weeks.	Boya a le gba to ọsẹ meji.
The bus sped off, cutting off many cars.	Ọkọ akero naa sare lọ, o ge ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kuro.
I do not want that anymore.	Emi ko fẹ iyẹn mọ.
That's all you need.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo ohun ti o nilo.
Some see them as the best and others as the most beautiful.	Diẹ ninu awọn wo wọn bi o dara julọ julọ ati awọn miiran bi ibi pupọ julọ.
You will find them.	O yoo wa wọn.
Her head is as sweet as ever.	Ori re dun bi ko tii ri.
Position, position, position.	Ipo, ipo, ipo.
It was great to hear your voice again.	O jẹ nla lati gbọ ohun rẹ lẹẹkansi.
We do not see the world as things are but as we are.	A ko ri aye bi awọn ohun ti wa ni sugbon bi a ba wa ni.
Nothing will make me stay here.	Ko si ohun ti yoo jẹ ki n duro nibi.
He is killing her.	O n pa a.
He tried, but could not understand.	O gbiyanju, ṣugbọn ko le loye.
You don’t have to think for a minute.	O ko ni lati ronu fun iṣẹju kan.
We will bring them to account here.	A yoo mu wọn si iroyin nibi.
So we have this program.	Nitorina a ni eto yii.
You need the service.	O nilo iṣẹ naa.
I killed him.	Mo ti pa a.
This celebration is great for our friends.	Ayẹyẹ yii dara julọ fun ọrẹ wa.
She shook her head, her mouth slightly.	O mi ori, ẹnu rẹ diẹ.
What were you doing last night?	Kini o n ṣe ni alẹ ana?
It is only small.	O jẹ kekere nikan.
But he has never been on a boat.	Ṣugbọn ko ti wa lori ọkọ oju omi rara.
That's who you are.	Ti o rẹ ẹniti awọn.
But, boy, did you worry before you talked to me?	Ṣugbọn, ọmọkunrin, o ni aniyan ṣaaju ki o to ba mi sọrọ.
He saw himself completely.	O ri ara rẹ patapata.
But he did not wake up.	Sugbon ko ji.
They have been working on it for months.	Wọn ti ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ fun awọn oṣu.
And it continues.	Ati pe o tẹsiwaju.
It begins to rise.	O bẹrẹ lati dide.
They can keep it forever.	Wọn le tọju rẹ lailai.
They have no idea how to handle the situation.	Wọn ko ni imọran bi wọn ṣe le mu ipo naa.
It’s too much for him.	O ju pupọ lọ si i.
I have nothing to say.	Emi ko ni nkankan lati sọ.
He has not yet told anyone why, and no one knows.	Ko tii sọ idi rẹ fun ẹnikẹni, ko si si ẹnikan ti o mọ.
But he said nothing.	Ṣugbọn ko sọ ohunkohun.
He began to write.	O bẹrẹ lati kọ.
No need for children.	Ko nilo awọn ọmọde.
How much will you get ?.	Elo ni iwọ yoo rii?.
But this does not stop.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko duro.
We have a body to suit everyone.	A ni ara lati ba gbogbo eniyan.
They beat them.	Wọn lu wọn.
I'll have to do something.	Emi yoo ni lati ṣe nkan kan.
Here, drink some water.	Nibi, mu diẹ ninu omi.
I have no interest in anything.	Emi ko ni anfani ni ohunkohun.
They are not brothers.	Wọn kii ṣe arakunrin.
I have no power to stop what happened.	Emi ko ni agbara lati da ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
All the same.	Gbogbo kanna.
The school has no students.	Ile-iwe naa ko ni awọn ọmọ ile-iwe kankan.
Important points.	Awọn aaye pataki.
We can see how it works.	A le rii bi o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
To use one is to love it.	Lati lo ọkan ni lati nifẹ rẹ.
I know a good place.	Mo mọ aaye ti o dara.
Today, this is no longer a picture of power.	Loni, eyi kii ṣe aworan agbara mọ.
You do not know how to sit.	O ko mọ bi o ṣe le joko.
Everything is on the table.	Ohun gbogbo wa lori tabili.
This is due to one or both of the two factors.	Eyi jẹ nitori ọkan tabi mejeeji ti awọn nkan meji.
Everything you can think about wakes up from here.	Gbogbo ohun ti o le ronu nipa ji kuro ni ibi.
It's been a long time.	Igba pipẹ ni.
They get the stuff.	Wọn gba awọn nkan naa.
I do not know why we are here.	Emi ko mọ idi ti a wa nibi.
I do not know.	Emi ko mọ.
We have to run now.	A ni lati ṣiṣe ni bayi.
I didn’t say anything about my previous team.	Emi ko sọ ohunkohun nipa ẹgbẹ mi ti tẹlẹ.
So much so that they will kill them.	Pupọ julọ pe wọn yoo pa wọn.
Today, no.	Loni, ko si.
I am worried about it.	Emi ni aniyan nipa rẹ.
Nothing personal.	Ko si nkan ti ara ẹni.
Whatever you want to do, you have to hurry.	Ohunkohun ti o fẹ lati ṣe, o ni lati yara.
We hate it so much.	A korira rẹ ki Elo.
Father, both brothers.	Baba, awọn arakunrin mejeeji.
We need to recharge.	A nilo lati gba agbara pada.
I have a bad feeling.	Mo ni rilara buburu.
And, of course, the team didn’t do much.	Ati pe, dajudaju, ẹgbẹ ko ṣe pupọ.
O ju u.	O ju u.
Things are not good for us at all.	Awọn nkan ko dara fun wa rara.
He didn’t know that this would be what he needed to do.	Ko mọ pe eyi yoo jẹ ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe.
Your body, of course.	Ara rẹ, dajudaju.
You’re in love with her, aren’t you?	O ni ife pẹlu rẹ, àbí o?
Phone and see if you are at home.	Foonu ki o rii boya o wa ni ile.
Their applications are rejected.	Awọn ohun elo wọn kọ.
You have to be the whole team.	O ni lati jẹ gbogbo ẹgbẹ.
I mean men.	Mo tumọ si awọn ọkunrin.
Or let us think.	Tabi ki a ro.
No problem at all, even if we hit.	Ko si iṣoro rara, paapaa ti a ba lu.
Okay, that’s a lot more understanding.	O dara, iyẹn jẹ oye pupọ diẹ sii.
However, it was my father's decision.	Sibẹsibẹ, ipinnu baba mi ni.
For any length of time.	Fun eyikeyi ipari ti akoko.
He didn’t think of them, as he did.	Ko ro wọn, bi o ti ṣe.
You think it might have ended now.	O ro pe o le ti pari ni bayi.
It is the same here.	O jẹ kanna nibi.
With a man.	Pẹlu ọkunrin kan.
You make enough money.	O ṣe owo ti o to.
They find it difficult at first.	Wọn rii pe o nira ni akọkọ.
And it was a mistake.	Ati pe o jẹ aṣiṣe.
I will find time for this.	Emi yoo wa akoko fun eyi.
I love it so much.	Mo nifẹ bẹ bẹ.
The song is dead.	Orin naa ku.
It is not wrong.	Kii ṣe aṣiṣe.
I do not agree with them.	Emi ko gba pẹlu wọn.
Bread is not always easy to find.	Akara ko rọrun nigbagbogbo lati wa.
The door should not open.	Ilẹkun ko yẹ ki o ṣi silẹ.
The fact is that you do not have time to do both.	Otitọ ni pe iwọ ko ni akoko lati ṣe awọn iṣẹ mejeeji.
Off the field, too.	Pa aaye naa, paapaa.
I can’t tell you that, of course.	Emi ko le so fun o pe, dajudaju.
He decided to work.	O pinnu lati ṣiṣẹ.
A little tea.	Tii diẹ.
Think of music.	Ronu ti orin.
Sorry, forget about time.	Ma binu, gbagbe lati akoko.
But we grew up.	Ṣugbọn a dagba.
It is a mistake.	O jẹ aṣiṣe.
My father was forced to believe me.	Baba mi ti fi agbara mu lati gba mi gbọ.
It was amazing to do.	O jẹ iyanu lati ṣe.
I was there at the time.	Mo wa nibẹ ni akoko yẹn.
Did they die at the same time, or did they leave ?.	Njẹ wọn ku ni akoko kanna, tabi wọn lọ kuro?.
He was much too young.	O si wà Elo ju odo.
And good hair day.	Ati ọjọ irun ti o dara.
I mean, everyone loves it.	Mo tumọ si, gbogbo eniyan nifẹ rẹ.
We can not do anything.	A ko le ṣe ohunkohun.
Okay, here we go.	O dara, nibi a lọ.
And when the day comes when it is over, leave.	Ati pe ti ọjọ ba de nigbati o ba pari, lọ kuro.
The name of the highest man.	Orukọ eniyan ti o ga julọ.
You always forget.	Nigbagbogbo o maa n gbagbe.
Let’s hope you can like it.	Jẹ ki a nireti pe o le fẹran rẹ.
Okay, that's not true.	O dara, iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
What do you think of the house?	Kini o ro ti ile?
I know very well.	Mo mọ daradara.
In a game.	Ninu ere kan.
But he has no idea why this is so.	Ṣugbọn ko ni imọran idi ti eyi fi ri bẹ.
That we are a family.	Pe a jẹ idile.
I really learned.	Mo kọ ẹkọ gaan.
I will not pay anyone to do these things for me.	Emi kii yoo san owo fun ẹnikẹni lati ṣe nkan wọnyi fun mi.
The roads are now full of people.	Awọn opopona ti kun fun eniyan bayi.
They have no time to lose.	Wọn ko ni akoko kankan lati padanu.
At least he decided to stay around.	O kere ju o ti pinnu lati duro ni ayika.
The child has not heard this before.	Ọmọ naa ko tii gbọ eyi tẹlẹ.
Do not try to become anything.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati di ohunkohun.
Not always easy.	Ko rọrun nigbagbogbo.
You will be missed.	O yoo wa ni padanu.
This raises two important questions.	Eyi beere awọn ibeere pataki meji.
You know these people.	O mọ awọn eniyan wọnyi.
They keep everything good for themselves.	Wọn tọju gbogbo nkan ti o dara si ara wọn.
The days, not yet long, are getting longer.	Awọn ọjọ, ko sibẹsibẹ gun, ti n gun.
I do not know why he is worried about this girl.	Emi ko mọ idi ti o fi ṣe aniyan nipa ọmọbirin kan yii.
Some buildings are taller than others.	Diẹ ninu awọn ile ga ju awọn miiran lọ.
You can teach yourself to enjoy it.	O le kọ ara rẹ lati gbadun rẹ.
Not that they were angry about the plan.	Kii ṣe pe wọn binu nipa eto naa.
I never go again.	Emi ko lọ lẹẹkansi.
The talk of the town is a new restaurant.	Ọrọ ti ilu naa jẹ ile ounjẹ tuntun kan.
Look back.	Wo ẹhin.
He stopped for a rest.	O da duro fun isinmi.
I have to run.	Mo ni lati ṣiṣe.
This site is for everyone.	Aaye yii wa fun gbogbo eniyan.
It is not that he is very intelligent.	Kii ṣe pe o jẹ oye pupọ.
He is no longer a child.	Oun kii ṣe ọmọde mọ.
I have been hoping for it.	Mo ti nireti rẹ.
He has never decided this.	Ko ti pinnu eyi rara.
It is best to look at yourself.	O dara julọ lati wo ara rẹ.
You know yourself.	O mọ ara rẹ.
For thirty days.	Fun ọgbọn ọjọ.
We think this is for tonight only.	A ro pe eyi jẹ fun alẹ oni nikan.
Everything must die at one point in time.	Ohun gbogbo gbọdọ ku ni aaye kan ni akoko.
Now the word is out.	Bayi ọrọ ti jade.
Tomorrow, for sure, tomorrow.	Ọla, fun daju, ọla.
Only, the man is not dead.	Nikan, ọkunrin naa ko ti ku.
I have to get out of the house.	Mo ni lati jade kuro ni ile.
I love dogs.	Mo nifẹ awọn aja.
In the end, he decided to stay.	Ni ipari, o pinnu lati ma duro.
But it is something, perhaps.	Sugbon o jẹ nkankan, boya.
I'm telling you.	Mo n sọ fun ọ.
I want to not worry about who my husband is.	Mo fẹ lati ma ṣe aniyan nipa ẹniti ọkọ mi jẹ.
I do not know how long we stayed there like that.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe pẹ to ti a duro nibẹ bi iyẹn.
that's great news!	ti o ni nla awọn iroyin!
We will stay a few more days.	A yoo duro kan diẹ diẹ ọjọ.
Not only saw, but able to notice that we saw.	Ko nikan ri, ṣugbọn anfani lati se akiyesi wipe a ri.
I can handle that.	Mo le mu iyẹn.
They need each other.	Wọn nilo ara wọn.
I don’t have to ask for anything.	Emi ko ni lati beere fun ohunkohun.
When we get hot, they have winter.	Nigbati a ba gba ooru, wọn ni igba otutu.
I love them so much.	Mo nifẹ wọn pupọ.
I have to keep these books with me tonight.	Mo gbọdọ tọju awọn iwe wọnyi pẹlu mi ni alẹ oni.
It was a long way to travel for a story.	O jẹ ọna pipẹ lati rin irin-ajo fun itan kan.
I did everything they wanted me to do with it.	Mo ṣe ohun gbogbo ti wọn fẹ ki n ṣe pẹlu.
They killed their child.	Wọn pa ọmọ wọn.
For one thing, it's a lot of work.	Fun ohun kan, o jẹ ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ.
He returns when he returns.	O pada nigbati o ba pada.
You do not want any of this to happen.	O ko fẹ eyikeyi ti yi lati ṣẹlẹ.
Write down your thoughts.	Kọ awọn ero rẹ silẹ.
Just wait.	O kan duro.
I walk to work every day.	Mo rin lati ṣiṣẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
It is very difficult to change or transform.	O nira pupọ lati yipada tabi yipada.
People are at your house for a celebration.	Awọn eniyan wa ni ile rẹ fun ayẹyẹ kan.
These are things we can't eat.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn nkan ti a ko le jẹ.
Now we know why.	Bayi a mọ idi.
He nodded and left the room.	O kọ ati jade kuro ninu yara naa.
Who knows if you have one.	Tani o mọ pe o ni ọkan.
Most people are not born.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni a ko bi.
I can't remember the name.	Emi ko le ranti orukọ naa.
We remember you with love.	A ranti rẹ pẹlu ifẹ.
Sorry to say that.	Ma binu lati sọ iyẹn.
You can have for another day.	O le ni fun ọjọ miiran.
And in fact, so be it.	Ati ni otitọ, bẹ naa jẹ.
You have heard this.	O ti gbọ eyi.
I just want to keep.	Mo kan fẹ lati tọju.
Something is wrong with this.	Nkankan jẹ aṣiṣe pupọ pẹlu eyi.
I will talk to you about it.	Emi yoo ba ọ sọrọ nipa rẹ.
It can be very.	O le pupọ.
You are asked to stay for two days.	A beere lọwọ rẹ lati duro fun ọjọ meji.
You have to say what you know.	O ni lati sọ ohun ti o mọ.
Stay true to yourself and be yourself.	Duro otitọ si ara rẹ ki o jẹ ọ.
In a bad way.	Ni ọna buburu.
Sometimes love is all you have.	Nigba miiran ifẹ ni gbogbo ohun ti o ni.
Maybe he was afraid of her.	Boya o bẹru rẹ.
It does not work as well as you might think.	Ko ṣiṣẹ daradara bi o ṣe le ronu.
The “hot” choice is a fact.	Ayanfẹ "gbona" ​​jẹ ohun ti o daju.
I think it's a good thing.	Mo ro pe o jẹ ohun ti o dara.
She was too scared to speak.	O bẹru pupọ lati sọrọ.
In this day and age, people know.	Ni oni ati ọjọ ori, eniyan mọ.
He did not even say he did not.	Ko paapaa sọ pe ko ṣe.
You even get your voice back.	O paapaa gba ohun rẹ pada.
Two other people depend on me.	Awọn eniyan meji miiran da lori mi.
Some members stand on and others come on.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ duro lori ati awọn miiran wa lori.
Much easier to deal with.	Elo rọrun lati wo pẹlu.
You are not with him, that is the first thing.	Iwọ ko wa pẹlu rẹ, iyẹn ni ohun akọkọ.
I mean, maybe you have decided to know about it.	Mo tumọ si, boya o ti pinnu lati mọ nipa rẹ.
I do not believe that is or should be the law.	Emi ko gbagbọ pe iyẹn tabi yẹ ki o jẹ ofin.
I opted for a car.	Mo ti yọ kuro fun ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
This is incomprehensible.	Eyi ko ni oye.
He stayed for three days.	O duro ni ọjọ mẹta.
We must pull together.	A gbọdọ fa papọ.
Tell him, but do not force him.	Sọ fun u, ṣugbọn maṣe fi agbara mu u.
I want to change this.	Mo fe yi eyi pada.
Others do not.	Awọn miiran ko ṣe.
He sat in one and the decision was made.	O joko ni ọkan ati pe a ṣe ipinnu naa.
We do not have time to tell the story of that time.	A ko ni aaye lati sọ itan ti akoko yẹn.
I look back.	Mo wo ẹhin.
Sit here on fire.	Joko nibi ina.
They want attention.	Wọn fẹ akiyesi.
What’s happening is happening.	Ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ n ṣẹlẹ.
For, this trip will not be, if that is the case.	Fun, irin-ajo yii kii yoo jẹ, ti iyẹn ni idaniloju.
They did so only because of a mistake.	Wọn ṣe bẹ nikan nitori aṣiṣe kan.
We caught up with him there.	A mu soke pẹlu rẹ nibẹ.
Friends say everything to each other.	Awọn ọrẹ sọ ohun gbogbo fun ara wọn.
But do.	Ṣugbọn ṣe.
You need to go home.	O nilo lati lọ si ile.
Rain or shine, it will open tomorrow.	Ojo tabi ojo, yoo ṣii ni ọla.
You would have been the first to know.	Iwọ yoo ti jẹ ẹni akọkọ lati mọ.
I don’t think he killed his mother.	Emi ko ro pe o pa iya rẹ.
I should not eat too much last night.	Emi ko yẹ ki n jẹun pupọ ni alẹ ana.
There are rules for everything.	Awọn ofin wa fun ohun gbogbo.
You know when it hits.	O mọ nigbati o ti lu.
For a few minutes, he thought he would miss her.	Fun iṣẹju diẹ, o ro pe oun yoo padanu rẹ.
I feel my heart stopped beating.	Mo lero pe ọkan mi duro jẹ.
I met her last husband, a job.	Mo pade ọkọ rẹ ti o kẹhin, iṣẹ kan.
I'll wait for you, here.	Emi yoo duro de ọ, nibi.
I'll let you know how it goes.	Emi yoo jẹ ki o mọ bi o ti n lọ.
That is not an easy task.	Iyẹn kii ṣe iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
Okay, it's too late.	O dara, o ti pẹ ju.
Never seen, never seen.	Ko tii ri, ko si ri.
Tom was not there in person.	Tom ko wa nibẹ ni eniyan.
That means you can get out.	Eyi tumọ si pe o le jade.
I am glad that everyone is fine in front of that.	Inu mi dun pe gbogbo eniyan dara ni iwaju yẹn.
Change the way you do things.	Yi ọna ti o ṣe awọn nkan pada.
I shouldn’t worry.	Emi ko yẹ ki o ni aniyan.
I don't want to upset you.	Emi ko fẹ lati mu ọ binu.
This was changed.	A yi eyi pada.
Two heads are better than one.	Ori meji dara ju ọkan lọ.
We know what they do.	A mọ ohun ti wọn ṣe.
I have plans for the future.	Mo ni eto fun ojo iwaju.
It has to be another one of your tests.	O ni lati jẹ miiran ọkan ninu awọn idanwo rẹ.
We need more homes in this city.	A nilo awọn ile diẹ sii ni ilu yii.
He stood back.	O duro sẹhin.
The others in the room look at each other.	Awọn miiran ninu yara wo ara wọn.
No down as it is.	Ko si isalẹ bi o ṣe jẹ.
He came, as always, back to me.	O wa, bi nigbagbogbo, pada si mi.
Power seemed to pay out of itself.	Agbara dabi enipe o san jade ninu ara rẹ.
They say they hear something like this all the time.	Wọn sọ pe wọn gbọ nkan bii eyi ni gbogbo igba.
They like that.	Wọn fẹran iyẹn.
I stick with this right now.	Mo duro pẹlu eyi ni bayi.
We do not think it exists.	A ko ro pe o wa.
That is what drew my attention to you.	Ohun ti o fa akiyesi mi si ọdọ rẹ niyẹn.
There is only so long you can miss the news.	Nibẹ ni nikan ki gun o le padanu awọn iroyin.
This really kills me.	Eyi n pa mi gaan.
It may take some time.	O le gba akoko diẹ.
Please make sure you give a gift of life.	Jọwọ rii daju pe o fun ni ẹbun igbesi aye.
The ancient sites are back to ancient times.	Awọn aaye igba atijọ ti pada si akoko igba atijọ.
What you say is so.	Ohun ti o sọ jẹ bẹ.
I know it is.	Mo mọ pe o jẹ.
It seemed important.	O dabi enipe pataki.
I am talking about in the future.	Mo n sọrọ nipa ni ojo iwaju.
But not this group.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ẹgbẹ yii.
But my story is not just for them.	Ṣugbọn itan mi kii ṣe fun wọn nikan.
I need to let it happen.	Mo nilo lati jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
If not, well do it.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, daradara ma ṣe.
I was tired of living with him.	O ti re mi lati gbe pẹlu rẹ.
And it is always for the better.	Ati pe o jẹ nigbagbogbo fun dara julọ.
But no one.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan.
I am sure I will do so again.	Mo dajudaju Emi yoo tun ṣe bẹ lẹẹkansi.
Maybe this is the way all men, to kill.	Boya eyi ni ọna gbogbo awọn ọkunrin, lati pa.
But you have to give them.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati fi fun wọn.
It's time to dump her and move on.	O to akoko ti o n ronu nipa iyawo paapaa.
I am very happy.	Inu mi dun pupo.
We hope to see you there !.	A nireti lati ri ọ nibẹ!.
Not sure we look good, but of course we feel better.	Ko daju pe a wo dara julọ, ṣugbọn dajudaju a lero dara julọ.
I am he.	Emi ni oun.
I'll always see you.	Emi yoo ma wo ọ.
The sister is not very nice.	Arabinrin ko dara julọ.
That has been the case for years.	Iyẹn ti jẹ awọn ipo fun awọn ọdun.
No fun and winning.	Ko si fun ati ki o gba.
Use the time as you wish.	Lo akoko naa bi o ṣe fẹ.
It makes sense today.	O ṣe oye loni.
You know the game.	O mọ ere naa.
He made his way through the trees.	O mu ọna rẹ nipasẹ awọn igi.
More even better, a little less than that can also sound good.	Diẹ sii paapaa dara julọ, diẹ kere ju iyẹn tun le dun dara.
How did it go.	Bawo ni o ṣe lọ.
If possible send us more money because there is more money now.	Ti o ba ṣee ṣe fi owo diẹ ranṣẹ si wa nitori pe owo ni bayi diẹ.
To see what can be seen, viz.	Lati wo ohun ti a le rii, bii.
That would be a wise thing to do.	Eyi yoo jẹ ohun ti ọgbọn lati ṣe.
He felt old.	O si ro atijọ.
They have changed groups.	Wọn ti yipada awọn ẹgbẹ.
There is a lot of work to be done.	Iṣẹ pupọ wa lati ṣe.
I give him life now in everything.	Mo fun u ni aye bayi ninu ohun gbogbo.
It cannot be completed by a parent or student.	O ko le pari nipasẹ obi tabi ọmọ ile-iwe.
Even in your heart.	Paapaa ninu ọkan rẹ.
This is beautiful, isn't it?	Eyi lẹwa, ṣe kii ṣe bẹẹ?
That will continue.	Iyẹn yoo tẹsiwaju.
I do not believe you think so.	Emi ko gbagbọ pe o ro bẹ.
She was fast on her feet.	O yara lori ẹsẹ rẹ.
When they stopped, they saw a big accident.	Nigba ti wọn duro, wọn ri ijamba nla kan.
No one seems to work.	Ko si ọkan ti o dabi pe o ṣiṣẹ.
Of course, it can not.	Dajudaju, ko le.
They went down.	Wọn lọ silẹ.
Obviously, the problem is twofold.	O han ni, iṣoro naa jẹ meji.
No one ever read them.	Ko si ọkan lailai ka wọn.
You can not leave.	O ko le lọ kuro.
Not enough time to talk about this right now.	Ko to akoko lati sọrọ nipa eyi ni bayi.
Her eyes are happy.	Oju re dun.
Operate.	Ṣiṣe.
But what happened happened.	Ṣugbọn ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ti ṣẹlẹ.
Try to work before your dog is with you.	Gbiyanju lati ṣiṣẹ ṣaaju ki aja rẹ to wa pẹlu rẹ.
This tree was the only damage of the day.	Igi yii nikan ni ipalara ti ọjọ naa.
They like to watch trains together.	Wọn fẹran lati wo awọn ọkọ oju irin papọ.
We are all at work.	Gbogbo wa ni iṣẹ́.
He lives alone.	O ngbe nikan.
But we are not here to remove our understanding.	Ṣugbọn a ko wa nibi lati yọ oye wa kuro.
We look forward to meeting you.	A nireti lati pade rẹ.
You probably didn’t read the whole thing.	O ṣee ṣe ko ka gbogbo nkan naa.
Are they selling food here?	Ṣe wọn n ta ounjẹ nibi?
Many of them began to think his thoughts.	Pupọ ninu wọn bẹrẹ lati ro ero rẹ.
He took her to the car.	O gbe e lọ si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
I know how it works.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
It may take two years.	O le gba ọdun meji.
He picked it up in celebration.	O gbe e soke ni ayẹyẹ.
No one would think it was good enough.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo ro pe o dara to.
Help may be available.	Iranlọwọ le wa.
But keep working.	Ṣugbọn tẹsiwaju ṣiṣe.
I do not stand for myself at all.	Emi ko duro fun ara mi rara.
Dide ko le.	Dide ko le.
There is work to be done.	Iṣẹ wa lati ṣe.
No one can tell him what to do.	Ko si ẹniti o le sọ fun u kini lati ṣe.
And most of us do.	Ati pupọ julọ wa ṣe.
You know his name.	O mọ orukọ rẹ.
Their old house has been rebuilt.	A ti tun ile atijọ wọn kọ.
Ask your doctor before you know where to go.	Beere dokita rẹ ṣaaju ki o to mọ ibiti o lọ.
I can't say for sure.	Emi ko le sọ gaan.
Without asking.	Laisi a beere.
I stand on my own.	Mo duro lori mi.
Very good.	O dara pupọ.
You know your hair.	O mọ irun ori rẹ.
He would not have them.	Oun yoo ko ni wọn.
I began to find myself.	Mo bẹrẹ lati wa ara mi.
They are there on a special mission.	Wọn wa nibẹ lori iṣẹ pataki kan.
It should be two days.	O yẹ ki o wa ni ọjọ meji.
You, however, know better.	Iwọ, sibẹsibẹ, mọ dara julọ.
A reasonable amount of time can be fixed by contract.	Akoko ti o ni oye le jẹ ti o wa titi nipasẹ adehun.
Have you heard of that new restaurant?	Njẹ o ti gbọ ti ile ounjẹ tuntun yẹn?
But that is also a situation.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn tun jẹ ipo kan.
See the text !.	Wo awọn ọrọ!.
You should measure money.	O yẹ ki o wọn owo.
She stands to get a young boy.	O duro lati gba ọmọkunrin ọdọ kan.
We can not know.	A ko le mọ.
Is there.	O wa nibẹ.
And that makes me happier than anything.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ ki inu mi dun ju ohunkohun lọ.
What a good person you are.	Kini o dara eniyan ti o ba wa.
The sun is at its height.	Oorun wa ni giga rẹ.
It is for me.	O wa fun mi.
This is not entirely true.	Eyi kii ṣe otitọ patapata.
This is not the time to change.	Eyi kii ṣe akoko lati yi pada.
Children of the deceased member may also use.	Awọn ọmọde ti ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti o ku le tun lo.
It is time to have children.	Akoko wa lati ni awọn ọmọde.
It will only have three tracks.	Nikan yoo ni awọn orin mẹta.
First, you can very much.	Ni akọkọ, o le pupọ julọ.
In life, people are always trying to help.	Ni igbesi aye, awọn eniyan nigbagbogbo n gbiyanju lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
I should know.	Mo yẹ ki o mọ.
I missed them so much and they missed me.	Mo padanu wọn pupọ ati pe wọn padanu mi.
I am convinced it is not appropriate.	Mo da mi loju pe ko yẹ.
Whatever it is, start there, and be good at it.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ, bẹrẹ nibẹ, ki o si dara ni o.
I say, good to sleep.	Mo sọ pe, o dara lati sun.
They completely lost the point.	Wọn padanu aaye naa patapata.
Probably not.	O ṣeeṣe ki a ma ṣe.
Do not try to lift anything.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati gbe ohunkohun.
And not the first.	Ati pe kii ṣe akọkọ.
There is no water to drink.	Ko si omi lati mu.
Here is what happened.	Eyi ni ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It was a beautiful day.	O jẹ ọjọ ti o lẹwa.
It’s the best thing ever.	O jẹ ohun ti o dara julọ lailai.
You should go ask them.	O yẹ ki o lọ beere wọn.
I think it opens in the right way.	Mo ro pe o ṣii ni ọna ti o tọ.
They have a game on us.	Wọn ti ni ere lori wa.
In fact, it is impossible to do so.	Ni otitọ, ko ṣee ṣe lati ṣe bẹ.
Repeat the same now.	Tun kanna ni bayi.
It is pulled in.	O ti fa sinu.
Nothing is impossible if you try hard enough.	Ko si ohun ti ko ṣee ṣe ti o ba gbiyanju lile to.
But we know that sometimes it does.	Ṣugbọn a mọ pe nigba miiran o wa.
It's time to act.	O to akoko lati ṣe.
Let me tell you this.	Jẹ ki n sọ eyi fun ọ.
I'm sure most of us understand this.	O da mi loju pupo ninu wa loye eyi.
Right now, the city is on its side.	Ni bayi, ilu naa wa ni ẹgbẹ rẹ.
This depends a lot on your community.	Eyi da pupọ lori agbegbe rẹ.
What you see is well treated.	Ohun ti o wo ni a tọju daradara.
I give him a hand.	Mo fun u ni ọwọ.
Everything seemed so hard.	Ohun gbogbo dabi enipe ki lile.
It doesn't work either.	Ko ṣiṣẹ boya.
She is in school.	O wa ni ile-iwe.
I will be honest with you.	Emi yoo jẹ otitọ pẹlu rẹ.
You will love them.	Iwọ yoo nifẹ wọn.
He left again after a few hours.	O tun lọ lẹhin awọn wakati diẹ.
They will tell us where to go.	Wọn yoo sọ fun wa ibiti a yoo lọ.
My children thought it.	Awọn ọmọ mi ro o.
At least someone did.	O kere ju ẹnikan ṣe.
Let’s end this meeting.	Jẹ ki a pari ipade yii.
They are there, they are looking for us.	Wọn wa nibẹ, wọn n wa wa.
I hate it so much.	Mo korira rẹ pupọ.
It should not be here.	Ko yẹ ki o wa nibi.
He always took a nap	Nigbagbogbo o mu oorun oorun
It is this feeling here.	O jẹ rilara yii nibi.
What city is this?	Ilu wo ni eyi?
It has to be a better plan than what you are doing right now.	O ni lati jẹ eto ti o dara ju ohun ti o n ṣe ni bayi.
That will not leave me.	Iyẹn kii yoo fi mi silẹ.
They are on a table.	Wọn wa lori tabili kan.
You must see that.	O gbọdọ rii iyẹn.
I only wear them inside.	Mo wọ wọn nikan ni inu.
Pick up the dog and go home.	Gbe aja soke ki o lọ si ile.
The room was clean yet a little old.	Yara je o mọ sibẹsibẹ kekere kan atijọ.
Cities are always near rivers.	Awọn ilu nigbagbogbo wa nitosi awọn odo.
I don't talk to anyone, what do you do.	Emi ko sọrọ ti o si ẹnikẹni, ohun ti o ṣe.
It all seemed good.	Gbogbo dabi enipe o dara.
Maybe you’re finishing things to buy.	Boya o ti n pari awọn nkan lati ra.
I am finishing school tomorrow.	Mo n pari ile-iwe ni ọla.
No one knows when.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ nigbati.
Everyone should learn more about this concept.	Gbogbo eniyan yẹ ki o kọ ẹkọ diẹ sii nipa imọran yii.
They have lived a life.	Wọn ti gbe igbesi aye kan.
And that's great.	Ati pe o dara julọ.
I moved and moved again.	Mo gbe ati gbe lẹẹkansi.
Sister, who she is	Arabinrin, ẹniti o jẹ
It's too hot.	O gbona gaan.
I will tell you why.	Emi yoo sọ idi eyi fun ọ.
I do not need to say what to believe.	Emi ko nilo lati sọ kini lati gbagbọ.
We need a new song.	A nilo orin tuntun kan.
I am getting big money in it.	Mo n gba owo nla ninu rẹ.
It just doesn’t.	O kan ko ṣe.
No problems were found.	Ko si awọn iṣoro ti a rii.
I stay with him.	Mo duro pẹlu rẹ.
How is this possible.	Bawo ni eyi ṣe ṣee ṣe.
They do not know where the music came from.	Wọn ko mọ ibiti orin naa ti wa.
The same old story.	Kanna atijọ itan.
You can be sure of your hands on.	O le jẹ daju ti ọwọ rẹ lori.
And students are everywhere.	Ati awọn ọmọ ile-iwe wa nibi gbogbo.
Everyone seemed to know each other.	O dabi enipe gbogbo eniyan mọ ara wọn.
And I don’t understand much from it.	Ati pe emi ko loye pupọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
We should first say no to them.	A yẹ ki o ni akọkọ wipe ko wọn.
She finished her tea, and got up to leave.	O pari tii rẹ, o si dide lati lọ kuro.
We have to talk this over.	A ni lati sọrọ yi lori.
He takes it pretty seriously.	O si gba o lẹwa pataki.
They met under a tree.	Wọn pade labẹ igi kan.
The police may ask people to say what they know.	Ọlọpa le beere pe ki eniyan sọ ohun ti wọn mọ.
No, not music.	Rara, kii ṣe orin.
You will not go without it.	O ko ni lọ laisi rẹ.
You can do so.	O le ṣe bẹ.
I could see that he wanted to be serious.	Mo ti le ri pe o fe lati wa ni pataki.
We tried to stop them from stealing our fire.	A gbiyanju lati da wọn lọwọ lati ji ina wa.
I will not wait any longer.	Emi kii yoo duro mọ.
But another girl was there, too.	Ṣugbọn ọmọbirin miiran wa nibẹ, paapaa.
To your home after school.	Si ile rẹ lẹhin ile-iwe.
I love to run outside.	Mo nifẹ lati ṣiṣe ni ita.
It’s a simple fact.	O jẹ otitọ ti o rọrun.
None of us have.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa ti o ti ṣe bẹ.
To start work.	Lati bẹrẹ iṣẹ.
There is no fixed interest.	Ko si anfani ti o wa titi.
The baby is sleeping.	Oorun sun ọmọ naa.
My life changed completely.	Aye mi yipada patapata.
People are enjoying a celebration.	Awọn eniyan n gbadun ayẹyẹ kan.
O san soke.	O san soke.
You should not hesitate to ask for help.	O yẹ ki o ṣiyemeji lati beere fun iranlọwọ.
He is in love.	O wa ninu ifẹ.
We start here for two reasons.	A bẹrẹ nibi fun idi meji.
However you go for nothing out there.	Sibẹsibẹ ti o lọ fun ohunkohun jade nibẹ.
You can not give life to a good person.	O ko le fun aye ni eniyan ti o dara.
He put himself into his work.	O fi ara rẹ sinu iṣẹ rẹ.
That is what you have to bring out there.	Iyẹn jẹ ohun ti o ni lati mu jade nibẹ.
That is important to know.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki lati mọ.
Some places are better than others.	Diẹ ninu awọn aaye dara ju awọn miiran lọ.
It crossed his eyes.	O kọja oju rẹ.
That day has not come.	Ọjọ yẹn ko de.
You know, a lot of people miss that point.	O mọ, ọpọlọpọ eniyan padanu oju iyẹn.
You may need.	O le nilo.
The sister gets angry before dinner.	Arabinrin naa ma binu ṣaaju ounjẹ alẹ.
They have to do so.	Wọn ni lati ṣe bẹ.
The better you get in it, the better life.	Awọn dara ti o gba ni o, awọn ti o dara aye.
Such things to say.	Iru awọn nkan lati sọ.
It uses more energy.	O lo agbara diẹ sii.
Not really a bad kid, if you want one.	Kii ṣe ọmọ buburu gaan, ti o ba fẹ ọkan.
New music has been added.	A ti fi orin tuntun kun.
But he thinks they do sometimes.	Ṣugbọn o ro pe wọn ṣe nigba miiran.
I do not understand, he said, about anything.	Emi ko ni oye, o sọ, nipa ohunkohun.
I do not understand what this is about.	Emi ko loye kini eyi jẹ nipa.
Come to us if you can.	Wa si wa ti o ba le.
I have heard of you before but not your brother.	Mo ti gbọ ti rẹ tẹlẹ ṣugbọn kii ṣe arakunrin rẹ.
But found nothing.	Sugbon ko ri nkankan.
I tell you this.	Mo sọ eyi fun ọ.
He did not touch the device at all.	Ko fi ọwọ kan ẹrọ naa rara.
Maybe my picture will be in the book.	Boya aworan mi yoo wa ninu iwe naa.
We will watch the game.	A yoo wo ere naa.
I can't even talk to you.	Emi ko le ba ọ sọrọ paapaa.
So it was great that you had a hard time.	Nitorina o jẹ nla pe o ni akoko lile.
Show yourself as a teacher.	Fi ara rẹ han bi olukọ.
It gives them life.	O fun wọn ni aye.
He also bathed.	O tun wẹ.
Yet one in love.	Sibẹsibẹ ọkan ninu ifẹ.
And that's beautiful.	Ati pe o lẹwa ni iyẹn.
The past is past.	Ti o ti kọja ti kọja.
I think we are right.	Mo ro pe a ni o tọ.
I suspect you know all about it.	Mo fura pe o mọ gbogbo nipa rẹ.
I can’t wait to see how it transforms everyone into everyone else.	Emi ko le duro bi o ṣe yi gbogbo eniyan pada si gbogbo eniyan miiran.
Soon, they started to laugh ‘themselves’.	Laipẹ, wọn bẹrẹ lati rẹrin 'ara wọn.
He left the first world.	O lọ kuro ni aye akọkọ.
They refused to go.	Wọn kọ lati lọ.
He stayed with our son.	O duro pẹlu ọmọ wa.
How long does it take to climb a mountain?	Igba melo ni o gba lati gun oke kan?
If there is a person.	Ti eniyan ba wa.
I was wrong.	Mo ṣe aṣiṣe.
I am not sure it is right for him.	Emi ko da mi loju pe o tọ fun u.
So what are we waiting for ?!	Nitorina kini a n duro de ?!
Many, and we do not know what they are.	Ọpọlọpọ, ati pe a ko mọ kini wọn jẹ.
It’s time to think about it.	O to akoko lati ronu nipa rẹ.
We knew we had to do something.	A mọ pe a ni lati ṣe nkan kan.
We are.	A wà.
He did not.	Ko ṣe bẹ.
How can I go about this.	Bawo ni MO ṣe le lọ nipa eyi.
Men were not as afraid as women at that time.	Awọn ọkunrin ko bẹru bi awọn obinrin ni akoko yẹn.
You did very well.	O ṣe daradara pupọ.
At least some of them.	O kere diẹ ninu wọn.
I will be off the road.	Emi yoo kuro ni ọna.
Everyone has to make a living.	Gbogbo eniyan ni lati ṣe igbesi aye.
They use games as home appliances.	Wọn lo awọn ere bi ohun elo ile.
I do not remember that.	Emi ko ranti iyẹn.
It has to do with everyone else.	O ni lati ṣe pẹlu gbogbo eniyan miiran.
I hope you believe that.	Mo nireti pe o gbagbọ pe.
I wish we could.	Mo fẹ a le.
I can't really get this.	Emi ko le gba eyi gaan.
Nothing just.	Ko si nkankan o kan.
Some have curly hair.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni irun ara.
I also missed and had to stop the student.	Mo tun padanu ati pe o ni lati da ọmọ ile-iwe duro.
How sweet these words sound.	Bawo ni awọn ọrọ wọnyi ṣe dun to.
I get it all now.	Mo gba gbogbo mi ni bayi.
Need to work around that right now.	Nilo lati ṣiṣẹ ni ayika iyẹn ni bayi.
The girls did not move.	Awọn ọmọbirin ko gbe.
I understand why it happened.	Mo loye idi ti o fi ṣẹlẹ.
Of course, some people may also write.	Dajudaju, diẹ ninu awọn eniyan le tun kọ.
They have a son together.	Wọn ni ọmọkunrin kan papọ.
Before us.	Ṣaaju ki o to wa.
They are much lighter and much easier to carry around than books.	Wọn jẹ ina pupọ ati rọrun pupọ lati gbe ni ayika ju awọn iwe lọ.
We live in these small houses.	A n gbe ni awọn ile kekere wọnyi.
However, my brother had problems.	Sibẹsibẹ, arakunrin mi ni awọn iṣoro.
That will attract others to your work.	Iyẹn yoo fa awọn miiran si iṣẹ rẹ.
At least tell me why they need to send a woman.	Ni o kere so fun mi idi ti won nilo lati fi obinrin kan ranṣẹ.
He said 'maybe not'.	O si wipe 'boya ko'.
You must complete it.	O gbọdọ pari rẹ.
They do not love me.	Wọn ko nifẹ mi.
I stand by so much to learn.	Mo duro ni ọpọlọpọ pupọ lati kọ ẹkọ.
Who he is.	Ẹniti o jẹ.
Learn a new skill.	Kọ ẹkọ ọgbọn tuntun kan.
Children are our future.	Awọn ọmọ ni ojo iwaju wa.
Leave my bags and wait.	Fi awọn apo mi silẹ ki o duro.
It is near a tree.	O wa nitosi igi kan.
Either way, it continues.	Ọna boya, o tẹsiwaju.
Only, of course, does not say so.	Nikan, dajudaju, ko sọ bẹ.
Feeling it.	Rilara rẹ.
I love my music, man.	Mo feran orin mi, eniyan.
I'm afraid it just came.	Mo bẹru pe o kan wa.
This is not what you expect, from the young girl.	Eyi kii ṣe ohun ti o nireti, lati ọdọ ọmọbirin ọdọ naa.
He raised his eyes.	O gbe oju rẹ soke.
Sorry, we mean great surprise.	Ma binu, a tumọ si iyalẹnu nla.
You can't see it, but you can hear it.	O ko le ri i, ṣugbọn o le gbọ rẹ.
And it is more than that.	Ati pe o jẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
It is not that my work should be anything more than it is.	Kii ṣe pe iṣẹ mi yẹ ki o jẹ ohunkohun diẹ sii ju bi o ti jẹ lọ.
Use what and how it feels right to you.	Lo kini ati bawo ni o ṣe rilara ti o tọ si ọ.
Everything else you have left.	Gbogbo ohun miiran ti o ti fi silẹ.
The sister will be fine now.	Arabinrin naa yoo dara ni bayi.
You need to eat more.	O nilo lati jẹ diẹ sii.
If you notice it will die.	Ti o ba ṣe akiyesi rẹ yoo ku.
But they are not, and in fact, impossible to do.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii ṣe, ati ni otitọ, ko ṣee ṣe lati ṣe bẹ.
Learn why they come out bad.	Kọ ẹkọ idi ti wọn fi jade ni buburu.
The man did not have any of it.	Ọkunrin naa ko ni eyikeyi ninu rẹ.
If he has no money, he cannot pay.	Ti ko ba ni owo, ko le san.
The children have dropped out of school.	Awọn ọmọde ti lọ kuro ni ile-iwe.
We were gone for three hours.	A ti lọ fun wakati mẹta.
This is a decision.	Eyi jẹ ipinnu.
I like both.	Mo feran awon mejeeji.
It’s a very intelligent way.	O jẹ ọna ti o ni oye pupọ.
You will learn to love it.	Iwọ yoo kọ ẹkọ lati nifẹ rẹ.
Change your clothes.	Yi aṣọ rẹ pada.
They will visit me at the end of the year.	Wọn yoo ṣabẹwo si mi ni akoko ọdun kan.
We are not there.	A ko wa nibẹ.
Tonight, if that is possible.	Ni alẹ oni, ti iyẹn ba ṣee ṣe.
Jobs are things.	Awọn iṣẹ jẹ awọn nkan.
But with much less stress.	Ṣugbọn pẹlu Elo kere wahala.
It is very easy to try, and does not take time.	O rọrun pupọ lati gbiyanju, ati pe ko gba akoko.
They are special.	Wọn jẹ awọn pataki.
We have not tested it before.	A ko ṣe idanwo tẹlẹ.
That is a fact.	Otitọ niyen.
He asked for a cup of tea.	O beere ife tii kan.
You know that by now.	O mọ pe nipasẹ bayi.
Now, of course, he did not want to eat anything at that time.	Ni bayi, dajudaju, ko fẹ lati jẹ ohunkohun nigba yẹn.
When you're gone.	Nigbati o ba lọ.
This works.	Eyi ṣiṣẹ.
Now he too is gone.	Bayi oun naa ti lọ.
But if they go, they will not return.	Ṣugbọn ti wọn ba lọ, wọn ko le pada.
Hurry, or it will be too late for work!	Yara, tabi o yoo pẹ fun iṣẹ!
They are our brothers, just like everyone else.	Wọn jẹ arakunrin wa, bii ẹnikẹni miiran.
The car is a beautiful vehicle and worth the money.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ jẹ kan lẹwa ọkọ ati ki o tọ awọn owo.
It should not look like this.	Ko yẹ ki o dabi eyi.
You can see that.	O le rii si iyẹn.
And there are other faces as well.	Ati pe awọn oju miiran tun wa.
He does not want to return.	Ko fe pada.
The sister was a little better that way.	Arabinrin naa dara diẹ ni ọna yẹn.
I think that is enough.	Mo ro pe iyẹn ti to.
I called after him.	Mo pe lẹhin rẹ.
To be born in the morning with the day.	Lati bi ni owurọ pẹlu ọjọ.
I picked myself up the vehicles.	Mo ti gbe ara mi soke awọn ọkọ.
He lives alone.	O ngbe nikan.
So, you made no mistake.	Nitorina, o ko ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
Wait now, baby!	Duro ni bayi, ọmọ!
A good pass is the one you are taking.	A ti o dara kọja ni ọkan ti o ti wa ni mu.
I was scared.	Mo bẹru.
But others also work.	Ṣugbọn awọn miiran tun ṣiṣẹ.
They’re talking about where the road will go tomorrow.	Wọn n sọrọ nipa ibi ti ọna yoo lọ ni ọla.
Give him a try.	Fun u gbiyanju.
You can not write.	O ko le kọ.
Will you find out what is happening to me?	Ṣe iwọ yoo wa ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ fun mi?
However, these methods have their own problems.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ọna wọnyi ni awọn iṣoro ti ara wọn.
It does not seem to have been there for a long time.	O dabi pe ko ti wa nibẹ fun igba pipẹ.
He was beautiful.	O si wà lẹwa.
We have to go through with it.	A ni lati lọ nipasẹ pẹlu rẹ.
Tell what you see.	Sọ ohun ti o ri.
Taken.	Ti mu.
In my room.	Ninu yara mi.
You better get back here now.	O dara ki o pada wa nibi ni bayi.
I continue on all this in my head.	Mo tẹsiwaju lori gbogbo eyi ni ori mi.
You are not someone.	Iwọ kii ṣe ẹnikan.
It seemed to clear my head a little, especially.	O dabi enipe lati ko ori mi diẹ, paapaa.
That is what appeared to me.	Ohun ti o han si mi niyẹn.
He called the police for help	O pe ọlọpa fun iranlọwọ
But he did not see it.	Sugbon ko wo o.
Get something to eat if you are not good.	Gba nkan lati jẹ ti o ko ba dara.
I want you to go with us.	Mo fẹ ki o lọ pẹlu wa.
Stand on top of it.	Duro lori oke rẹ.
We will be friends.	A yoo jẹ ọrẹ.
This is not true anymore.	Eyi kii ṣe otitọ mọ.
Be sure to tell us how good it is.	Rii daju lati sọ fun wa bi o ṣe dara to.
And you have to do that.	Ati pe o ni lati ṣe iyẹn.
I think no one around me knows about it.	Mo ro pe ko si ẹnikan ti o wa ni ayika mi ti o mọ nipa rẹ.
Excellent schools.	Awọn ile-iwe ti o dara julọ.
They were all amazed at his amazing work.	Ẹnu ya gbogbo wọn si iṣẹ iyalẹnu rẹ.
Okay, here it is for him, in a way.	O dara, o wa nibi fun u, ni ọna kan.
He told me to go back to bed.	O so fun mi pada si ibusun.
I will talk to you soon.	Emi yoo ba ọ sọrọ laipẹ.
His mother was not human.	Iya rẹ kii ṣe eniyan.

As we are not really aware.	Bi kii ṣe ti wa mọ gaan.
They got married the following year.	Wọn ṣe igbeyawo ni ọdun to nbọ.

You always look great.	O nigbagbogbo wo pupọ.
They are around people.	Wọn wa ni ayika eniyan.

We notice our arrival.	A ṣe akiyesi dide wa.
You have to stop completely.	O ni lati duro patapata.
You should learn to accept the position as it is.	O yẹ ki o kọ ẹkọ lati gba ipo naa bi o ti jẹ.
And that’s only the first story.	Ati pe iyẹn nikan ni itan itan akọkọ.
It could be something.	O le jẹ nkan.
I wanted to beat him but couldn't.	Mo fe lati lu u sugbon ko le.
He changed jobs every few years.	O yipada awọn iṣẹ ni gbogbo ọdun diẹ.
This makes me just be there now.	Eyi jẹ ki mi kan wa ni bayi.
He is not happy about the situation.	Ko dun nipa ipo naa.
We have all kinds of high.	A ni gbogbo iru ga.
After a while, this will cause problems.	Lẹhin akoko kan, eyi yoo fa awọn iṣoro.
It is only at home, so no problem.	O wa ni ile nikan, nitorina ko si iṣoro.
I just want you to know that it is good to do that.	Mo kan fẹ ki o mọ pe o dara lati ṣe iyẹn.
I'm trying.	Mo n gbiyanju.
We talk.	A sọrọ.
That would have attracted attention.	Iyẹn yoo ti fa akiyesi.
Just save us.	Kan gba wa silẹ.
Someone had to buy it for him.	Ẹnikan ni lati ra fun u.
I must see it.	Mo gbọdọ ri rẹ.
You never know what's going to happen.	O ko mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
I can help you with this my friend.	Mo le ran ọ lọwọ pẹlu eyi ọrẹ mi.
That’s the last thing you want.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti o kẹhin ti o fẹ.
The city has many high-rise buildings.	Ilu naa ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ile giga.
And we need another.	Ati pe a nilo miiran.
No one noticed, he said to himself.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe akiyesi, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
I don't need anything else.	Emi ko nilo ohunkohun miiran.
It seems.	O dabi pe.
He has been here just over a year.	O ti wa nibi o kan ju ọdun kan lọ.
Or maybe it happened.	Tabi boya o ṣẹlẹ.
He looked inside the bag.	O wo inu apo naa.
He fell asleep.	O sun sinu.
I have no time to wait for him.	Emi ko ni akoko lati duro fun u.
But he is fine with it now.	Ṣugbọn o dara pẹlu rẹ ni bayi.
Let’s bring our stories to him.	Jẹ ki a mu awọn itan wa fun u.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself!	Da rilara binu fun ara rẹ!
Just there.	O kan wa nibẹ.
I can only change myself.	Mo le yi ti ara mi nikan.
It will help you get a job.	Yoo ran ọ lọwọ lati gba iṣẹ.
Feeling good, because he did a great job here.	Rilara dara, nitori o ṣe iṣẹ nla kan nibi.
He’s always doing what he thinks is best for me.	O n ṣe ohun ti o ro pe o dara julọ fun mi nigbagbogbo.
I'll get it back and get something else for you.	Emi yoo gba pada ki o gba nkan miiran fun ọ.
I think love is love.	Mo ro pe ifẹ jẹ ifẹ.
So is the man.	Bẹẹ ni ọkunrin naa.
He also sold it.	O tun ta a.
But he wanted more.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ diẹ sii.
Why not cut in hours.	Idi ti a ko ge ni wakati.
And that’s all, you know.	Ati pe iyẹn ni gbogbo rẹ, o mọ.
However, of course.	Sibẹsibẹ, dajudaju.
The deal is here.	Adehun wa nibi.
Maybe they have had enough.	Boya wọn ti ni to.
He is completely human right now.	O jẹ eniyan patapata ni bayi.
Her stories are high but true.	Awọn itan rẹ ga ṣugbọn otitọ.
I know how.	Mo ti mọ bi.
This has the potential to be an amazing program.	Eyi ni agbara lati jẹ eto iyalẹnu.
One of them is drinking.	Ọkan ninu wọn ni mimu.
This accident can cost lives.	Ijamba yii le ni iye owo aye.
You get a higher top.	O gba oke ti o ga julọ.
That was probably good, but it didn't feel good.	Ti o wà jasi ti o dara, sugbon o ko lero ti o dara.
I don’t think anything has time.	Emi ko ro ohunkohun ti o ni akoko.
I am learning a lot.	Mo n kọ ẹkọ pupọ.

This is the best one.	Eyi ni eyi ti o dara julọ.
I made a deal with myself.	Mo ṣe adehun pẹlu ara mi.
Good, it looks bad.	O dara, o dabi buburu.
That is one reason why it should not be here.	Idi kan niyẹn ti ko fi yẹ ki o wa nibi.
Have you ever thought about what you would say?	Njẹ o ti ronu nipa ohun ti iwọ yoo sọ?
He is a bad man.	Eniyan buburu ni.
They would have made this decision for themselves.	Wọn yoo ti ṣe ipinnu yii fun ara wọn.
We are not talking.	A ko sọrọ.
And in many ways, what it is.	Ati ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna, ohun ti o jẹ.
When or why we do not know.	Nigbawo tabi idi ti a ko mọ.
I looked at them, and shook my head.	Mo wo wọn, mo si mi ori mi.
It's over enough.	O ti kọja to.
He relied on her.	O fi ara le e.
I do not need to read many books.	Emi ko nilo lati ka ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe.
This is a difficult decision.	Eyi jẹ ipinnu ti o nira.
As he waits for us.	Bi o ti n duro de wa.
As you have the space.	Bi o ti ni aaye naa.
We are all good and well finished.	Gbogbo wa dara ti o pari daradara.
They want this thing together.	Wọn fẹ nkan eyi papọ.
Just amazing.	O kan iyalẹnu.
Of course this is true for people.	Dajudaju eyi jẹ otitọ fun eniyan.
This requires completion.	Eyi beere fun ipari.
This must be your office.	Eyi gbọdọ jẹ ọfiisi rẹ.
On the first day, no one noticed the letter.	Ni ọjọ akọkọ, ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe akiyesi lẹta naa.
It is important.	O jẹ pataki.
In a word, they are human.	Ni ọrọ kan, wọn jẹ eniyan.
You, you know, pop out with them.	Iwọ, o mọ, gbe jade pẹlu wọn.
I would not expect this to happen.	Emi yoo ko nireti pe eyi yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Your friend has borrowed a little money.	Ọrẹ rẹ ti ya a diẹ owo.
That’s more than everyone needs.	Iyẹn ju gbogbo eniyan nilo lọ.
I do not want to talk about it.	Emi ko fẹ lati sọrọ nipa rẹ.
My cat is asleep.	Ologbo mi ti sun.
The sister was angry.	Arabinrin naa binu.
Si o, we can use.	Si o, a le lo.
It may be smaller.	O le jẹ kere.
Or your feet.	Tabi ẹsẹ rẹ.
I do not understand.	Oye mi gaan.
Not that much has changed that way.	Kii ṣe pe pupọ ti yipada ni ọna yẹn.
I do not really believe he is still there.	Emi ko gbagbọ gaan pe o tun wa nibẹ.
You will not have your phone with you.	O yoo ko ni foonu rẹ pẹlu rẹ.
I can not understand them.	Emi ko le ṣe oye wọn.
She thought of her sister.	O ro ti arabinrin rẹ.
And here.	Ati nibi.
It got everyone thinking.	O gba gbogbo eniyan ni ero.
As he entered the room, he realized something was wrong.	Bi o ti n wọ inu yara naa, o mọ ohun kan ti ko tọ.
The picture is with me.	Aworan naa wa pẹlu mi.
Every time it is the same.	Ni gbogbo igba ti o jẹ kanna.
But they did not say much.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko sọ pupọ.
Don't be too late.	Maṣe pẹ ju.
This has happened many times for us to treat it.	Eyi ti ṣẹlẹ ni ọpọlọpọ igba fun a tọju rẹ.
Or a friend.	Tabi ọrẹ kan.
I would wear the same outfit.	Emi yoo wọ aṣọ kanna.
In this situation, we have to make a hard decision.	Ni ipo yii, a ni lati ṣe ipinnu lile kan.
The sister who had seen the dog, said nothing.	Arabinrin ti o ti ri aja, ko sọ nkankan.
You can do amazing things with it, help people.	O le ṣe awọn ohun iyanu pẹlu rẹ, ṣe iranlọwọ fun eniyan.
Go, my child.	Lọ, ọmọ mi.
I really don't want to go.	Emi ko fẹ gaan lati lọ.
That's how it works.	Bi o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ niyẹn.
Easy for everyone without heat.	Rọrun fun gbogbo eniyan laisi ooru.
Like before you could not come.	Bii ṣaaju o ko le wa.

For me there is no reason to worry.	Fun mi ko si idi kan lati ṣe aniyan.
That's good.	Iyẹn dara.
I have a problem.	Mo wa pẹlu iṣoro kan.
First make your tea.	Ni akọkọ ṣe tii rẹ.
For me, it was a big mistake.	Fun mi, o jẹ aṣiṣe nla kan.
But try it and see how much it can help you.	Ṣugbọn gbiyanju rẹ ki o wo iye ti o le ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ.
Now, let’s get started.	Bayi, jẹ ki a bẹrẹ.
I do not help much.	Emi kii ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
My children grow up every year.	Awọn ọmọ mi dagba ni gbogbo ọdun.
I think most people do not accept the book.	Mo ro pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan ko gba iwe naa.
He will come back.	Yoo pada wa.
Have you found an error yet?	Njẹ o ti rii aṣiṣe kan sibẹsibẹ?
More information is better than less information.	Alaye diẹ sii dara ju alaye ti o kere ju.
We can be sure how this happened.	A le rii daju bi eyi ṣe ṣẹlẹ.
You never know when it's over.	O ko mọ igba ti o ti pari.
Yours is a story that will lift you up.	Rẹ jẹ itan ti yoo gbe ọ.
Ask questions if something is not clear to you.	Beere awọn ibeere ti nkan kan ko ba han ọ patapata.
I like to travel at night.	Mo fẹ lati rin irin-ajo ni alẹ.
Or better yet, use another device to test it.	Tabi dara julọ, lo ẹrọ miiran lati ṣe idanwo rẹ.
He took her into a small room.	O mu u lọ sinu yara kekere kan.
He could not, could not help his friend.	Ko le, ko le ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọrẹ rẹ.
Will take you to my office.	Yoo mu ọ lọ si ọfiisi mi.

Okay, of course, they will.	O dara, dajudaju, wọn yoo.
At first, the girls did not know each other.	Ni akọkọ, awọn ọmọbirin ko mọ ara wọn.
I turned around and looked at the family.	Mo yipada mo si wo idile naa.
I am yours for the next few hours.	Mo jẹ tirẹ fun awọn wakati diẹ to nbọ.
And most of all, treat people as human beings.	Ati ju gbogbo rẹ lọ, tọju eniyan bi eniyan.
We didn’t get up much.	A ko dide si pupọ.
He lived there while working.	O ngbe nibẹ nigba ti o ṣiṣẹ.
But at the same time, all life is important.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko kanna, gbogbo igbesi aye ṣe pataki.
I will find something wrong.	Emi yoo wa ohun ti ko tọ.
The site should work well.	Aaye naa yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
Two for you.	Meji fun o.
I invited you to my house.	Mo pe e si ile mi.
I hope you never forget your site again.	Mo nireti pe o ko gbagbe aaye rẹ lẹẹkansi.
It will improve working conditions.	Yoo mu awọn ipo iṣẹ dara si.
You do not know why it will come.	O ko mọ idi ti yoo fi wa.
First, we need some tea.	Ni akọkọ, a nilo tii diẹ.
I tried to get this information that way.	Mo gbiyanju lati gba alaye yii ni ọna yẹn.
I think sometimes.	Mo ro pe nigba miiran.
That is the truth.	Iyẹn ni awọn otitọ.
His desire to do the right thing is the ultimate desire.	Ifẹ rẹ lati ṣe ohun ti o tọ jẹ ifẹ ikẹhin.
They had to drag him into the store.	Wọn ni lati fa u sinu ile itaja.
It’s not just my eyes that go.	Kii ṣe oju mi ​​nikan ni o lọ.
Some may have both.	Diẹ ninu awọn le ni awọn mejeeji.
You do not know what is there.	O ko mọ ohun ti o wa nibẹ.
You will have to change your priorities and priorities.	Iwọ yoo ni lati yi awọn ohun pataki ati awọn pataki rẹ pada.
As they have a point.	Bi wọn ti ni aaye kan.
And the world needs books.	Ati awọn aye nilo awọn iwe ohun.
I can't wait.	Emi ko duro.
If you are gone you are gone.	Ti o ba ti lọ o ti lọ.
He wants money.	O fe owo.
You know that to be true.	O mọ pe lati jẹ otitọ.
You will have to be smarter.	Iwọ yoo ni lati jẹ ọgbọn diẹ sii.
Okay, for him.	O dara, fun u.
You need to fly a good one, that is.	O nilo lati fo kan ti o dara, iyẹn ni.
Do something else.	Ṣe nkan miiran.
I have no desire to see more.	Emi ko ni ifẹ lati ri diẹ sii.
He was a very important student.	O jẹ ọmọ ile-iwe ti o ṣe pataki julọ.
Also, try to anticipate as much as you can.	Paapaa, gbiyanju lati nireti bi o ti le ṣe.
Of course there is.	Dajudaju o wa.
Well, not young, really.	Daradara, kii ṣe ọdọ, ni otitọ.
And you should meet him.	Ati pe o yẹ ki o pade rẹ.
I don't feel bad enough.	Nko rilara buburu to.
Some come from other years.	Diẹ ninu awọn wa lati ọdun miiran.
You may not have created the whole world.	O le ko ti da gbogbo aye.
You see a lot of the same houses today.	O ri ọpọlọpọ awọn ile kanna loni.
The program is beautiful.	Eto naa lẹwa.
Her hair style is fast.	Ara irun rẹ jẹ yara.
She looks like a man.	O dabi ọkunrin kan.
I have found myself.	Mo ti ri ara mi.
And he heard something.	O si gbọ ohun kan.
As soon as he got out of place, he stopped to look.	Ni kete ti o jade ni ibiti o wa, o duro lati wo.
He is angry.	O binu.
You can do better than that.	O le ṣe daradara ju iyẹn lọ.
However, everything else did.	Sibẹsibẹ, ohun gbogbo miiran ṣe.
I just want to let you think.	Mo kan fẹ lati jẹ ki o ronu.
When we meet again.	Nigba ti a ba tun pade.
At the time we were sure he had not seen us.	Ni akoko ti a ni idaniloju pe ko ri wa.
Good on us.	O dara loju wa.
I’m sure they have no idea what to do.	Mo dajudaju pe wọn ko ni imọran kini lati ṣe.
He was very young.	O jẹ ọmọde pupọ.
I can walk again.	Mo ti le rin lẹẹkansi.
It's opening up.	O n ṣii soke.
But he has done very well.	Ṣugbọn o ti ṣe daradara pupọ.
Or maybe, come to that.	Tabi iwọ boya, wa si iyẹn.
Enough to leave.	To lati lọ kuro.
Some of us can do without a car.	Diẹ ninu wa le ṣe laisi ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
Talk to them through their advice.	Ba wọn sọrọ nipasẹ imọran wọn.
I have to get you back.	Mo gbọdọ gba ọ pada.
And the truth is that it never ends.	Ati awọn otitọ ni wipe o ko pari.
It doesn’t work with anyone.	Ko ṣiṣẹ pẹlu ẹnikẹni.
The river is longer than the sea.	Odo gun ju okun lo.
He seemed to forget his place in the story.	O dabi enipe o gbagbe ibi ti o wa ninu itan naa.
It looked amazing that night.	O wo iyanu ni alẹ yẹn.
You can not have both methods.	O ko le ni awọn ọna mejeeji.
They will always lose.	Wọn yoo padanu nigbagbogbo.
I'll go to work.	Emi yoo lọ ṣiṣẹ.
And they say everything to each other.	Ati pe wọn sọ ohun gbogbo fun ara wọn.
Your life will change forever.	Igbesi aye rẹ yoo yipada lailai.
But you are right.	Ṣugbọn o tọ.
And, of course, start small.	Ati, dajudaju, bẹrẹ kekere.
Now, this is a really big deal.	Bayi, eyi jẹ adehun nla gaan.
A bus driver lost control over them.	Awakọ ọkọ akero kan padanu ṣiṣe lori wọn.
There is only so much you can do.	Nibẹ ni nikan ki Elo ti o le se.
Very much everyone, my father told him, of the front door.	Pupọ julọ gbogbo eniyan, baba mi sọ fun u, ti ilẹkun iwaju.
He is young.	O jẹ ọdọ.
I looked at the clock.	Mo wo aago naa.
He was the first in his class.	O jẹ akọkọ ninu kilasi rẹ.
But again none of this happened.	Ṣugbọn lẹẹkansi ko si ọkan ninu eyi ti o ṣẹlẹ.
He was the best, and you know.	O si wà ni ti o dara ju, ati awọn ti o mọ.
He wanted to live near his sister.	O fe lati gbe nitosi arabinrin rẹ.
Everything worked fine last night.	Ohun gbogbo ti ṣiṣẹ daradara ni alẹ kẹhin.
How many years.	Bawo ni ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
A very good sister would probably say they did.	Arabinrin ti o dara pupọ yoo ṣee ṣe sọ pe wọn ṣe.
If you want something, work for it.	Ti o ba fẹ nkankan, ṣiṣẹ fun.
And we will leave there.	Ati pe a yoo fi silẹ nibẹ.
He stole a look at her.	O ji kan wo ni i.
Police have cordoned off the area.	Ọlọpa ti ti agbegbe naa.
I have seen it everywhere.	Mo ti rii ni gbogbo ibi.
A gift given with love.	Ẹbun ti a fi fun pẹlu ifẹ.
There is no way to know for sure, it is there.	Ko si ọna lati mọ daju, o wa nibẹ.
I have never met him.	Emi ko tii pade rẹ rara.
It should start to warm up soon.	O yẹ ki o bẹrẹ si gbona laipẹ.
The sister was very angry and asked him to do something.	Arabinrin naa binu pupọ o si beere pe ki o ṣe nkan kan.
I knew it would happen.	Mo mọ pe yoo ṣẹlẹ.
I will go to the party and have a good time.	Emi yoo lọ si ibi ayẹyẹ naa ati ki o ni akoko ti o dara.
You just haven’t met the right woman.	O kan ko tii pade obinrin ti o tọ.
He seems to know little about the situation.	O dabi ẹni pe o mọ diẹ nipa ipo naa.
For him, love has a purpose.	Fun oun, ifẹ ni idi kan.
It’s not that we don’t like it.	Kii ṣe pe a ko fẹran rẹ.
He has no problem with that.	Ko ni iṣoro pẹlu iyẹn.
We are not a human being.	A kii ṣe eniyan kan.
But there is more.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii wa.
They will have no interest in us.	Wọn kii yoo ni anfani ninu wa.
I'll go now.	Emi yoo lọ ni bayi.
More people now have no electricity.	Awọn eniyan diẹ sii ni bayi ko ni ina.
The sister did not want us to touch her in this situation.	Arabinrin ko fẹ ki a fi ọwọ kan ara rẹ ni ipo yii.
What we are saying, together.	Ohun ti a n sọ, papọ.
Summer and winter, day and night.	Ooru ati igba otutu, ọjọ ati alẹ.
Your problem can.	Iṣoro rẹ le.
It was a great time for the city.	O jẹ akoko nla fun ilu naa.
But that does not mean he is dead.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko tumọ si pe o ti ku.
So to speak.	Nitorina lati sọrọ.
It was beautiful metal.	O je lẹwa irin.
Every kind of life must have come from a father.	Gbogbo iru igbesi aye gbọdọ ti wa lati ọdọ baba kan.
But he wants to let it pass.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ jẹ ki o kọja.
You can live with that.	O le gbe pẹlu iyẹn.
I love that baby.	Mo nifẹ ọmọ yẹn.
Their application is poor.	Ohun elo wọn ko dara.
And it is not surprising.	Ati pe kii ṣe iyalẹnu.
In fact, no one was completely happy with it.	Ni otitọ, ko si ẹnikan ti o dun patapata pẹlu rẹ.
You don't need much.	O ko nilo pupọ.
It is written in one way, but there may be others.	A kọ ọ ni ọna kan, ṣugbọn awọn miiran le wa.
In other words, you can.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, o le.
It was a beautiful sight all year long.	O jẹ oju ti o dara julọ ni gbogbo ọdun.
It is not life for you.	Kii ṣe igbesi aye fun ọ.
The decision must wait.	Ipinnu gbọdọ duro.
Listen one below.	Gbọ kan ni isalẹ.
Only names are made.	Awọn orukọ nikan ni awọn ti o ṣe.
You won’t find many of them around now.	Iwọ kii yoo rii ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn ni ayika bayi.
Now that is gone.	Bayi iyẹn ti lọ.
We are angry.	Inu bi wa.
I wish it was everywhere.	Mo fẹ pe o wa nibi gbogbo.
I saw both around.	Mo ti ri awọn mejeeji ni ayika.
They want to see.	Wọn fẹ lati rii.
There is no one like him.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o dabi rẹ.
The baby is sleeping well in the crib.	Ọmọ naa ti sun daradara ni ibusun ibusun.
Like what they say.	Bi ohun ti wọn sọ.
You’re doing the right thing to do.	O n ṣe ohun ti o yẹ lati ṣe.
Nice to see.	O dara lati ri.
They meet an unknown man.	Wọn pade ọkunrin ti a ko mọ.
It should be all doors.	O yẹ ki o jẹ gbogbo ilẹkun.
The sea is full of life.	Okun kun pẹlu aye.
We are still working.	A tun n ṣiṣẹ.
But you should be afraid, he said to himself.	Ṣugbọn o yẹ ki o bẹru, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
It was the only time we saw it.	O jẹ akoko nikan ti a rii i.
We will give them what they want.	A yoo fun wọn ni ohun ti wọn fẹ.
He told me he had to get back to her.	O sọ fun mi pe o ni lati pada si ọdọ rẹ.
His future is not yet clear.	Ọjọ iwaju rẹ ko han sibẹsibẹ.
Test it now, she told him.	Ṣe idanwo rẹ ni bayi, o sọ fun u.
I will even cook for you.	Emi yoo paapaa se ounjẹ fun ọ.
It is an internal matter.	O jẹ ọrọ inu.
Many more boats will be needed.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkọ oju omi diẹ sii yoo nilo.
But they know better.	Ṣugbọn wọn mọ dara julọ.
The three sat together.	Awọn mẹta joko papọ.
And some trees.	Ati diẹ ninu awọn igi.
Not at this point but other places.	Kii ṣe ni aaye yii ṣugbọn awọn aaye miiran.
I can't think of you.	Emi ko le ro ero rẹ.
I am a human being.	Eniyan ni mi.
The book is well written and makes the process easier.	Iwe naa ti kọ daradara ati pe o jẹ ki ọna naa rọrun.
However, it is still beautiful.	Sibẹsibẹ, o tun lẹwa.
Always before he let them marry him.	Nigbagbogbo ṣaaju ki o ti jẹ ki wọn fẹ u.
Some families grow up together in this way.	Diẹ ninu awọn idile dagba papọ ni ọna yii.
All they need is food.	Gbogbo ohun ti wọn nilo ni ounjẹ.
That was very important to him.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki pupọ fun u.
He’s here already, always.	O wa nibi tẹlẹ, nigbagbogbo.
But where did this go from the company?	Ṣugbọn nibo ni eyi ti lọ kuro ni ile-iṣẹ naa?
He saw his faults appear in his eyes.	O ri awọn aṣiṣe tirẹ ti o han ni oju rẹ.
I can't understand what you mean.	Emi ko le loye kini o tumọ si.
He has a family.	O ni idile kan.
Get me now.	Gba mi ni bayi.
I'll try.	Emi yoo gbiyanju.
I just lost my job today.	Mo kan padanu ise mi loni.
It would be nice to have only one item to buy.	Yoo dara lati ni ohun kan nikan lati ra.
This is my life story.	Eyi ni itan igbesi aye mi.
I will make sure.	Emi yoo rii daju.
We are not forgotten.	A ko gbagbe.
Do them one at a time.	Ṣe wọn ọkan ni akoko kan.
I know you are convinced.	Mo mọ pe o da mi loju.
I really do.	Mo ṣe gaan.
Let me see you again.	Jẹ ki n ri lẹẹkansi.
I heard you say something.	Mo ti gbọ ti o sọ nkankan.
He did not refuse to speak.	Kii ṣe kọ lati sọrọ.
Inside was a letter.	Inu je kan lẹta.
And it is important to say that all life is important.	Ati pe o ṣe pataki lati sọ pe gbogbo igbesi aye ṣe pataki.
That guy can drink, man.	Arakunrin yẹn le mu, eniyan.
Nor does he look at you from side to side.	Bẹni ko wo ọ lati ẹgbẹ si ẹgbẹ.
Not on purpose.	Kii ṣe lori idi.
See a picture or picture of yourself.	Wo aworan tabi aworan ti ara rẹ.
This may seem hard but the simple fact.	Eyi le dabi lile ṣugbọn o rọrun otitọ.
He brought that out.	O gbe iyẹn jade.
All this in place.	Gbogbo eyi ni ibi.
So at least, this is your life.	Nitorina o kere ju, eyi ni aye rẹ.
So we know what happened.	Nitorina a mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
True, they wanted us because we were killed.	Otitọ ni, wọn fẹ wa nitori a pa.
At some point we will need money.	Ni aaye kan a yoo nilo owo.
If you have more questions, ask.	Ti o ba ni awọn ibeere diẹ sii, beere.
Take the time to learn how to use it.	Gba akoko lati kọ ẹkọ bi o ṣe le lo.
But his thoughts did not end with one night.	Ṣugbọn awọn ero rẹ ko pari pẹlu alẹ kan.
It can’t take you seriously.	Ko le mu ọ ni pataki.

Your speech is stressful.	Ọrọ rẹ jẹ wahala.
You have to do two more things.	O ni lati ṣe awọn nkan meji diẹ sii.
Only good.	O dara nikan.
He said you would not love me.	O sọ pe iwọ kii yoo nifẹ mi.
For that, that's fine.	Fun iyẹn, iyẹn dara.
At least not this morning.	O kere kii ṣe owurọ yii.
Go to them.	Lọ si wọn.

You can not have that.	O ko le ni iyẹn.
Marriage was great.	Igbeyawo je nla.
Which, for me, did not make much sense.	Eyi ti, fun mi, ko ṣe oye pupọ.
Kind of good.	Iru dara.
He says he is not in any trouble.	O ni oun ko tii wa ninu wahala kankan.
And do it honestly.	Ki o si ṣe ni otitọ.

No text found.	Ko si ọrọ ti a ti ri.
When you leave tonight, you will have.	Nigbati o ba lọ kuro ni alẹ oni, iwọ yoo ni.

Not a very good friend, but a friend.	Kii ṣe ọrẹ to dara pupọ, ṣugbọn ọrẹ kan.

He finished everything.	O pari ohun gbogbo.
He had already lost it, especially in his hand life.	O ti padanu rẹ tẹlẹ, paapaa ninu igbesi aye ọwọ rẹ.
I wouldn’t have that much money.	Emi ko ni ni owo pupọ yẹn.
Or don’t, leave more for me to get.	Tabi maṣe, fi silẹ diẹ sii fun mi lati gba.
However it is nothing.	Sibẹsibẹ kii ṣe nkankan.
You already know that this is here, of course you have.	O ti mọ pe eyi wa nibi, dajudaju o ni.

I have not seen him since.	Emi ko tii ri i lati igba naa.
I have seen faces, but not questions.	Mo ti ri oju, ṣugbọn kii ṣe awọn ibeere.
They hope to sell them for more.	Wọn nireti lati ta wọn fun diẹ sii.

And it was really great for me in so many ways.	Ati pe o jẹ nla si mi gaan ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna.

He's such a good guy.	O ni iru kan ti o dara eniyan.
Everyone there knows at least one other person.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o wa nibẹ mọ o kere ju eniyan miiran.
There is no future for you here.	Ko si ojo iwaju fun ọ nibi.
I will not say at all.	Emi ko ni sọ rara.
But it worried me that he would not look at me.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe aniyan mi pe ko ni wo mi.
He will not take any advantage.	Oun yoo ko gba eyikeyi anfani.
You must go to him.	O gbọdọ lọ si ọdọ rẹ.
For which he is angry.	Fun eyi ti o binu.
His father is gone is not new.	Baba rẹ ti lọ kii ṣe tuntun.
I understand very little, of course.	Mo loye pupọ diẹ, dajudaju.
You will not hurt me.	Iwọ kii yoo ṣe mi ni ipalara.

I hit him a few times.	Mo lu u ni igba diẹ.
I almost did, before thinking of something better.	Mo ti fẹrẹ ṣe, ṣaaju ki o to ronu nkan ti o dara julọ.
If you want things to change you go and change them.	Ti o ba fẹ ki awọn nkan yipada o lọ yi wọn pada.

Life has a way of taking you to places you never expected.	Igbesi aye ni ọna lati mu ọ ni awọn aaye ti o ko nireti rara.

It all starts here.	Gbogbo rẹ bẹrẹ nibi.
Mother and child.	Iya ati ọmọ.

And it was even happier that my brother tried to stop me.	Ati pe o dun paapaa pe arakunrin mi gbiyanju lati da mi.
You don’t have it.	Iwọ ko ni i.
Like many, in fact.	Bi ọpọlọpọ, ni otitọ.
We do not know why this happened.	A ko mọ idi ti eyi fi ṣẹlẹ.
I don't like this at all.	Emi ko fẹran eyi rara.
The wedding was amazing.	Igbeyawo naa jẹ iyanu.
And this is the most important.	Ati eyi ti o ṣe pataki julọ.
Height may be one of the reasons.	Giga le jẹ ọkan ninu awọn idi.
I want to do this below.	Mo fẹ ṣe eyi ni isalẹ.
And it happens to me that maybe this is the best place.	Ati pe o ṣẹlẹ si mi pe boya eyi jẹ aaye ti o dara julọ.
There are two things you do.	Ohun meji ni o ṣe.
I looked down and saw it was right.	Mo wo isalẹ mo si ri pe o tọ.
All but one person who is.	Gbogbo ṣugbọn ọkan eniyan ti o jẹ.

It looks like they are planning to leave.	O dabi pe wọn n gbero lati fi wọn silẹ.
Take a two week break, you will be fine.	Gba isinmi ọsẹ meji, iwọ yoo dara.

That’s not easy, let me tell you.	Iyẹn ko rọrun, jẹ ki n sọ fun ọ.
I don't know who he is.	Emi ko mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
That can be difficult.	Iyẹn le jẹ ki o nira.

But we do not know that.	Sugbon a ko mọ pe.
I'm sorry.	Ma binu.
Their house is my house.	Ile won ni ile mi.
They are asleep.	Wọn sun oorun.
Just don’t eat at home.	O kan ko jẹun ni ile.
I can't believe it's really mine.	Emi ko le gbagbọ pe o jẹ ti emi gaan.
And here are a few remains to be done.	Ati pe nibi awọn ku diẹ lati ṣee.
You're right.	O to.
Maybe it was intended to be.	Boya o ti pinnu lati jẹ.
We were on top of the game.	A wà lori oke ti awọn ere.
Now just look away.	Bayi o kan wo kuro.
No money is paid.	Ko si owo ti wa ni san.
He promised me he would hurt me last night.	O ṣe ileri fun mi pe oun yoo dun mi ni alẹ ana.
You can see them starting to think.	O le rii wọn ti o bẹrẹ lati ro pe.
I think a lot.	Mo ro pupọ.
You can’t get your head around it.	O ko le gba ori rẹ ni ayika rẹ.
This will allow you to get jobs at this point.	Eyi yoo jẹ ki o gba awọn iṣẹ ni aaye yii.
The hand still works.	Ọwọ ti o ṣi ṣiṣẹ.
Or not just an accident.	Tabi kii ṣe ijamba nikan.
The first thing he ever said to her.	Ohun akọkọ ti o sọ lailai fun u.
It never came out.	Ko jade rara.
I think that's good that they even saw that.	Mo ro pe iyẹn dara pe wọn paapaa rii iyẹn.
What’s wrong with making some deals?	Kini aṣiṣe pẹlu ṣiṣe awọn adehun diẹ?
It will not be possible.	Kii yoo ṣeeṣe.
It is good to get out of the house.	O dara lati jade kuro ni ile.
The boy also hated me.	Ọmọkunrin naa tun korira mi.
Driving time will begin soon.	Akoko awakọ yoo bẹrẹ laipẹ.
You can do your job, because you have to do it.	O le ṣe iṣẹ rẹ, nitori o gbọdọ ṣe.
I have made up my mind, the man said.	Mo ti pinnu ipinnu mi, ọkunrin naa sọ.
But he knew it was happening.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe o n ṣẹlẹ.
But it will not be clean and loving water.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo jẹ omi ti a mọ ati nifẹ.
I need to buy new shoes.	Mo nilo lati ra bata tuntun.
It is better not to go out at night.	O dara ki o ma ṣe jade ni alẹ.
I did not go back.	Emi ko pada sẹhin.
They have me and they know.	Wọn ni mi ati pe wọn mọ.
There are places.	O wa nibẹ ni awọn aaye.
Again nothing.	Lẹẹkansi ko si ohun.
Try to ask people where you can take these trips.	Gbiyanju lati beere lọwọ eniyan nibo ni o le gba irin-ajo wọnyi.
The uniform worn by the students.	Aṣọ ti awọn ọmọ ile-iwe wọ.
My everything is gone.	Gbogbo nkan mi ti lọ.
You will have time.	Iwọ yoo ni akoko.
Don't worry about it, it will be fine.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan nipa rẹ, yoo dara.
And you should go home to bed.	Ati pe o yẹ ki o lọ si ile si ibusun.
Keep where we go.	Tọju ibi ti a lọ.
Okay, that’s a lot of questions to ask.	O dara, iyẹn jẹ ibeere pupọ lati beere.
That can really add up over time.	Ti o le gan fi soke lori akoko.
His tone changed.	Ohun orin rẹ yipada.
I take it in this kind of thing every time we meet.	Mo mu u ni iru nkan yii ni gbogbo igba ti a ba pade.
He will kill you as soon as you have life.	Yoo pa a ni kete ti o ba ni aye.
It happens, man.	O ṣẹlẹ, eniyan.
She loves to live alone.	O nifẹ lati gbe nikan.
Put it in the picture.	Fi rẹ sinu aworan.
One business and many women.	Owo kan ati ọpọlọpọ awọn obinrin.

They all have to die.	Gbogbo wọn ni lati ku.

He travels a lot and always travels.	O rin irin-ajo pupọ ati pe o ma lọ nigbagbogbo.

And it will not change.	Ati pe kii yoo yipada.
He has made a lot of money.	O ti ni owo pupọ.
But, in the end, he said it himself.	Ṣugbọn, ni ipari, o sọ funrararẹ.
I love that.	Mo nifẹ iyẹn.
Even put that so they can see.	Paapaa fi iyẹn ki wọn le rii.
You know where you are, of course.	O mọ ibiti o wa, dajudaju.
There is nothing to do.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣe.
And they may not get the job done.	Ati pe wọn le ma to iṣẹ naa.
You always see the best in people.	O nigbagbogbo rii ohun ti o dara julọ ninu eniyan.
His song on this is that.	Orin rẹ lori eyi ni pe.
This must be a	Eyi gbọdọ jẹ a
He does not seem to know how much stress this can cause.	O dabi ẹni pe ko mọ iye wahala ti eyi le fa.
It means everything to me.	O tumọ si ohun gbogbo fun mi.
Then there are the other two.	Lẹhin ni awọn meji miiran wa.
He heard nothing from them.	Ko gbọ nkankan lati wọn.
He is your son.	Ọmọ rẹ ni.
Two accidents took at least two hours.	Awọn ijamba meji ni o kere ju wakati meji lọ.
Nothing works and I accept this error.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ ati pe Mo gba aṣiṣe yii.
His story is a great one.	Itan rẹ jẹ nla kan.
There is no human thought or feeling in them.	Ko si ero eniyan tabi rilara ninu wọn.
We've got a good one.	A ti ni kan ti o dara.
Okay, here it is, you think.	O dara, nibi o wa, o ro.
There are only three people in the big room.	Awọn eniyan mẹta nikan ni o wa ninu yara nla naa.
I do not, no.	Emi ko, rara.
He said he did not know why.	O sọ pe oun ko mọ idi rẹ.
I can't say you have it.	Nko le so pe o ni.
Your driver is good enough.	Awakọ rẹ dara to.
It’s good for him to do even that.	O dara fun u lati ṣe paapaa iyẹn.
The city is not very vulnerable.	Ilu naa ko ni ipalara pupọ julọ.
This is bad news.	Eyi ni iroyin buburu.
Just knock on your front door.	O kan ilẹkun iwaju rẹ.
I knew when it started.	Mo ti mọ nigbati o bẹrẹ.
One or the other.	Ọkan tabi awọn miiran.
It is not a place I would like to live.	Kii ṣe aaye ti Emi yoo fẹ lati gbe.
Okay, he'll be fine he won't.	O dara, oun yoo dara ko ni.
He wants to pay.	O fe san.
I said they didn’t because they couldn’t.	Mo sọ pe wọn ko ṣe nitori wọn ko le.
Well, in fact it is.	O dara, ni otitọ o jẹ.
Grow as a person.	Dagba bi eniyan.
He bathed in the sea.	O wẹ ninu okun.
Only two men have called me beautiful.	Awọn ọkunrin meji nikan ni o ti pe mi lẹwa.
They do not refuse.	Wọn ko kọ.
Now he is afraid.	Bayi o bẹru.
That was before.	Iyẹn jẹ ṣaaju.
Also good and no need to be afraid.	Tun dara ati pe ko nilo lati bẹru.
Now you want to love it.	Bayi o fẹ lati nifẹ rẹ.
Work now, before it's too late!	Ṣiṣẹ ni bayi, ṣaaju ki o pẹ ju!
It's human.	Eniyan ni.
Find wood for fire.	Wa igi fun ina.
Who will love forever after what you do.	Tani yoo fẹ lailai lẹhin ohun ti o ṣe.
It will not work.	O kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
But only married.	Sugbon nikan iyawo.
Have tried a lot of things.	Ti gbiyanju ọpọlọpọ nkan.
Wait a minute.	Duro fun iṣẹju kan.
This is a very difficult idea to understand.	Eyi jẹ ero ti o nira pupọ lati ni oye.
You can't delete the word from your words.	O ko le pa ọrọ naa kuro ninu awọn ọrọ rẹ.
If you have a problem, just ask, he said.	Ti o ba ni iṣoro kan, kan beere, o sọ.
They are both amazing.	Wọn jẹ iyalẹnu mejeeji.
She told him she was not worried about the matter.	O sọ fun u pe ko ṣe aniyan nipa ọrọ naa.
I have help with children for sure.	Mo ni iranlọwọ pẹlu awọn ọmọ fun daju.
It should work both ways.	O yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ awọn ọna mejeeji.
Wisdom learned or that.	Ọgbọn ti o kọ ẹkọ tabi pe.
You will come, will you?	Iwọ yoo wa, ṣe iwọ?
You have to have a device.	O ni lati ni ẹrọ kan.
I asked my question at the wrong time.	Mo beere ibeere mi ni akoko ti ko tọ.
People were talking at the time.	Awọn eniyan n sọ ni akoko yẹn.
Some live their own lives.	Diẹ ninu awọn igbesi aye ara wọn.
I don't know why.	Emi ko mọ idi ti iyẹn.
Perhaps he has not understood them either.	Boya oun naa ko ti loye wọn.
Now, today, we know that is not true.	Bayi, loni, a mọ pe kii ṣe otitọ.
John could not remember the accident.	John ko le ranti ijamba naa.
It would have hurt a little.	Yoo ti ṣe ipalara diẹ.
Money, money, money!	Owo, owo, owo!
They cannot save us.	Wọn ko le gba wa silẹ.
There is something special.	Ohun pataki kan ti wa.
So you need to find a place to live.	Nitorina o nilo lati wa ibi kan lati gbe.
You know you have a good hand as things stand.	O mọ pe o ni ọwọ ti o dara julọ bi awọn nkan ṣe duro.
Do whatever you want.	Ṣe ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
You are already in love.	O ti wa ni ifẹ tẹlẹ.
It’s the right idea.	O jẹ ero ti o tọ.
I went to them.	Mo lọ si ọdọ wọn.
It works and will continue to work.	O ṣiṣẹ ati pe yoo tẹsiwaju lati ṣiṣẹ.
To like.	Lati fẹ.
If you can continue, well and good.	Ti o ba le tẹsiwaju, daradara ati dara.
Questions need to be asked.	Awọn ibeere nilo lati beere.
All of these will be money.	Gbogbo awọn wọnyi yoo jẹ owo.
Now you just have to know who killed him.	Bayi o kan ni lati mọ ẹni ti o pa a.
Just be in the same room with her put it to the ear.	O kan wa ni yara kanna pẹlu rẹ fi i si eti.
You can't see the hand in front of your eyes out there.	O ko le ri ọwọ ni iwaju oju rẹ jade nibẹ.
He even told me that was the day we met.	Paapaa o sọ fun mi pe ni ọjọ ti a pade.
He also saw this man.	O tun rii ọkunrin yii.
Much left that you can learn.	Pupọ ti o ku ti o le kọ ẹkọ.
You use them.	O lo wọn.
And I am not alone.	Ati pe kii ṣe emi nikan.
It seems to be the office, my father's office.	O dabi pe o jẹ ọfiisi, ọfiisi baba mi.
Or maybe it will be your first love alone.	Tabi boya oun yoo jẹ ifẹ akọkọ rẹ nikan.
I couldn’t believe it for a minute.	Emi ko gbagbọ fun iṣẹju kan.
It’s a good thing you’ve been.	O jẹ ohun ti o dara ti o ti wa.
So we have been taught.	Nitorina a ti kọ wa.
You have more.	Iwọ ni diẹ sii.
It’s an interesting idea.	O jẹ imọran ti o nifẹ.
After a few minutes, he looked up.	Lẹhin iṣẹju diẹ, o wo soke.
Something big is happening.	Nkan nla n ṣẹlẹ.
He does not know error.	Ko mọ aṣiṣe.
But the baby appeared at the end.	Ṣugbọn ọmọ naa han ni ipari.
It was a question.	O je kan ibeere.
It just doesn’t matter that.	O kan ko ṣe pataki yẹn.
Game time will be lunch.	Akoko ere yoo jẹ ọsan.
We need them to tell us who we are.	A nilo wọn lati sọ fun wa ti a jẹ.
Let this love drive begin!	Jẹ ki yi ifẹ wakọ bẹrẹ!
I could be the one.	O le jẹ emi.
From the water the world came.	Lati omi ni aye ti wa.
But as things stand now.	Ṣugbọn bi awọn nkan ṣe duro ni bayi.
It makes it fast.	O mu ki o yara.
The best part is that, he is one of our people.	Eyi ti o dara julọ ni pe, o jẹ ọkan ninu awọn eniyan wa.
They raise children.	Wọn gbe awọn ọmọde.
Anything you want to talk about or understand.	Ohunkohun ti o fẹ lati sọrọ nipa tabi loye.
You can build a house.	O le kọ ile.
Or talk to anyone.	Tabi sọrọ si ẹnikẹni.
Truth always comes out in the end.	Otitọ nigbagbogbo n jade ni ipari.
But there is nothing we can do.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti a le ṣe.
The locals also did.	Awọn ọmọ agbegbe tun ṣe.
He devoted his life to public service.	O ya aye re si gbangba iṣẹ.
Not every week can be the best after all.	Ko gbogbo ọsẹ le jẹ ti o dara ju lẹhin ti gbogbo.
What if you can't understand it for no reason.	Kini ti o ko ba le loye laisi idi kan.
Now we have to find someone to do them.	Bayi a ni lati wa ẹnikan lati ṣe wọn.
The word is very sweet.	Ọrọ naa dun pupọ.
I will not say anything of your father.	Emi o sọ ohunkohun ti baba rẹ.
Nothing was taken from him.	Ko si ohun ti a gba lọwọ rẹ.
Any home you own is of limited value.	Ile eyikeyi ti o ni ni iye diẹ.
You should not do it.	O ko yẹ ki o ṣe.
She looked at the sun, she was happy.	O wo oorun, o dun.
We will return to this in the end.	A yoo pada si eyi ni awọn ipari.
With lights.	Pẹlu awọn ina.
These systems are very difficult to test.	Awọn ọna ṣiṣe wọnyi nira pupọ lati ṣe idanwo.
That will not happen, of course.	Iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ, dajudaju.
You will never want to live near a big city again.	Iwọ kii yoo fẹ lati gbe nitosi ilu nla lẹẹkansi.
This book bag is full of books.	Apo iwe yii kun fun awọn iwe.
He said everyone pulls their people that way.	O sọ pe gbogbo eniyan fa awọn eniyan wọn ni ọna yẹn.
Help yourself.	Ran ara re lọwọ.
But that by the way.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn nipasẹ ọna.
Must beat it into.	Gbọdọ lu o sinu.
I’m sure, good to see.	Mo dajudaju, o dara lati rii.
Now, time has changed.	Bayi, akoko ti yipada.
Come here and warm yourself by my fire.	Wa si ibi ki o mu ara rẹ gbona nipasẹ ina mi.
We can not have it in our lives.	A ko le ni ninu aye wa.
Now proceed.	Bayi tẹsiwaju.
Think back to these times, if you can.	Ronu pada si awọn akoko wọnyi, ti o ba le.
I had to make a house for myself.	Mo ni lati ṣe ile kan fun ara mi.
The wait time is.	Akoko duro jẹ.
Some children find that they lose a friend.	Awọn ọmọ kan rii pe wọn padanu ọrẹ kan.
Many of the women have jobs to help the family.	Pupọ ninu awọn obinrin naa ni iṣẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun idile.
It can be reached by a small passage.	O le de ọdọ nipasẹ ọna kekere kan.
I am not sure and wait.	Emi ko dajudaju o si duro.
She was afraid to touch him.	O bẹru lati fi ọwọ kan rẹ.
You will get from here.	O yoo gba lati ibi.
You have to make sure.	O ni lati rii daju.
They will give it to you.	Won yoo fun o.
He could not help himself.	Ko le ran ara rẹ lọwọ.
But that is not the way it happened.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọna ti o ṣẹlẹ.
I want to be that person.	Mo fe lati wa ni wipe eniyan.
They feel great.	Wọn lero nla.
When it comes time to the world.	Nigbati o ba de akoko si aye.
However, none of this happened.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko si ọkan ninu eyi ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It will take about two hours to complete.	Yoo gba to wakati meji lati pari.
Or maybe not.	Tabi boya ko.
I am not what you would call a great friend.	Emi kii ṣe ohun ti iwọ yoo pe ni ọrẹ nla kan.
Wonderful woman.	Obinrin iyanu.
He knew it was time to go.	O mọ pe o to akoko lati lọ.
I happen to agree that it won't work.	Mo ṣẹlẹ lati gba pe kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
None of it will matter.	Ko si ọkan ninu rẹ yoo ṣe pataki.
I do not believe.	Emi ko gbagbọ.
That worked well for him.	Iyẹn ṣiṣẹ daradara fun u.
It helps with everything.	O ṣe iranlọwọ pẹlu ohun gbogbo.
Tell me, you will be fine.	Sọ fun mi, iwọ yoo dara.
The ocean of life is in trouble.	Okun aye wa ninu wahala.
There was a future.	Nibẹ je kan ojo iwaju.
It is very easy for them.	O rọrun pupọ fun wọn.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	O dara ju rin.
He did it.	O ṣe e.
I’m working on that too.	Mo n ṣiṣẹ lori iyẹn paapaa.
This will not make your back any better.	Eyi kii yoo ṣe ẹhin rẹ eyikeyi ti o dara.
No need for it.	Ko si nilo fun o.
I have tried that.	Mo ti gbiyanju iyẹn.
And explain why the things you have seen do not help you.	Ki o si sọ idi ti awọn nkan ti o ti rii ko ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ.
He lifted his seat as the celebration began.	O gbe ijoko rẹ bi ayẹyẹ bẹrẹ.
Things worn down.	Awọn nkan ti a wọ si isalẹ.
They will come back.	Wọn yoo pada wa.
The truth is that they do not.	Otitọ ni pe wọn ko ṣe.
I can’t do as well as you did.	Emi ko le ṣe daradara bi o ti ṣe.
It must be good tea.	O gbọdọ jẹ tii ti o dara.
But if it is love, it cannot be.	Sugbon ti o ba jẹ ifẹ, ko le jẹ.
You can't finish things now.	O ko le pari awọn nkan bayi.
What they are doing is great.	Ohun ti wọn n ṣe jẹ nla.
Tell me more about that book.	Sọ fun mi diẹ sii nipa iwe yẹn.
I did it first.	Mo tun ṣe ni akọkọ.
All of this changed when the rules were passed.	Gbogbo eyi ti yipada nigbati awọn ofin ti kọja.
There are several reasons for this, and this is a great one.	Awọn idi pupọ lo wa fun rẹ, ati pe eyi jẹ nla kan.
There are many.	Ọpọlọpọ ti wa.
You always give my friends a hard time.	O nigbagbogbo fun awọn ọrẹ mi ni akoko lile.
I believe there is a marriage there at one point.	Mo gbagbọ pe igbeyawo kan wa nibẹ ni aaye kan.
Your phone is not working properly.	Foonu tirẹ yẹn ko dara.
I left for a while.	Mo ti fi silẹ fun igba diẹ.
I can't decide.	Nko le pinnu.
I did not ask and he did not tell me.	Emi ko beere ati pe ko sọ fun mi.
Now is your chance.	Bayi ni anfani rẹ.
Dogs have an understanding of the sun.	Awọn aja ni oye ti oorun.
Maybe it can work.	Boya o le ṣiṣẹ.
Her late father and her late mother.	Baba rẹ ti o ku ati iya rẹ ti o ku.
He did a great job on them.	O ṣe iṣẹ nla lori wọn.
You may or may not be able to travel in time.	O le tabi ko le ni anfani lati rin irin-ajo ni akoko.
You should try !.	O yẹ ki o gbiyanju!.
It is physical.	Ti ara ni.
People have many reasons to buy or sell.	Eniyan ni ọpọlọpọ awọn idi lati ra tabi ta.
He is my son.	Ọmọ mi ni.
Many say he is one of the greatest teams ever.	Ọpọlọpọ sọ pe o jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ẹgbẹ nla julọ lailai.
This will not work.	Eyi kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
I need both.	Mo nilo awọn mejeeji.
Only a few minutes.	Nikan iṣẹju diẹ.
It makes a small amount of decisions for you.	O ṣe iye diẹ ti awọn ipinnu fun ọ.
Thus, it is not a problem.	Bayi, kii ṣe iṣoro.
And we will let it work.	Ati pe a yoo jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
Lots and lots off.	Pupo ati ita pa.
I need to know who it is.	Mo nilo lati mọ ẹniti o ṣe.
You have to stop this.	O ni lati da eyi duro.
And he will know where.	Ati pe oun yoo mọ ibiti.
Most cars are in the parking lot.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ni o wa ni ibudo pa.
I could have stuck it out forever.	Mo ti le ti di o jade lailai.
Just warm them for a minute or so.	Kan gbona wọn fun iṣẹju kan tabi bii.
Your rope does not move.	Okun re ko gbe.
I just do not agree.	Mo kan ko gba.
And everyone wants to go to dinner.	Ati gbogbo eniyan fẹ lati lọ si ounjẹ alẹ.
That is more than bad.	Iyẹn jẹ diẹ sii ju ko dara.
And that’s the story.	Ati pe iyẹn ni itan naa.
He will love all of you to yourself.	Oun yoo fẹ gbogbo yin si ara rẹ.
However no one seems to know it.	Sibẹsibẹ ko si ẹnikan ti o dabi ẹni pe o mọ ọ.
You have everything for them.	Iwọ ni ohun gbogbo fun wọn.
The reasons are well known.	Awọn idi ti wa ni daradara mọ.
I can take care of myself.	Mo le tọju ara mi.
He knew nothing.	Ko mọ nkankan.
Nothing we have not seen before.	Ko si ohun ti a ko ti ri tẹlẹ.
He heard the advice, but could not help it.	O gbọ imọran naa, ṣugbọn ko le ṣe iranlọwọ.
This is my favorite.	Eyi ni ayanfẹ mi.
They say we help sell books.	Wọn sọ pe a ṣe iranlọwọ lati ta awọn iwe.
Let’s take a look at your application.	Jẹ ki a wo ohun elo rẹ.
The area around the city is uninhabited.	Agbegbe ti o wa nitosi ilu naa ko ni awọn eniyan.
He promised to celebrate.	O ṣe ileri lati ṣe ayẹyẹ.
I don’t know what it is for.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o jẹ fun.
He lifted one hand and held the rope.	O gbe ọwọ kan o si mu okun naa.
It never comes completely or returns.	O ko lailai wa patapata tabi pada.
We try to reach an agreement.	A gbiyanju lati de ọdọ adehun.
What a beautiful mountain that was.	Ohun ti a lẹwa oke ti o wà.
Of course, this is a human image.	Dajudaju, eyi ni aworan eniyan.
Which is not worth much.	Eyi ti ko ni iye si pupọ.
You may even want to give them back.	O le paapaa fẹ lati fun wọn pada.
He does not expect them to.	Ko nireti wọn lati.
And you can tell me what happened to me.	Ati pe o le sọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ fun mi.
But you can think of many others.	Ṣugbọn o le ronu ti ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran.
I don’t think that will happen for a while.	Emi ko ro pe iyẹn yoo ṣẹlẹ fun igba diẹ.
He will not be able to get anything beyond it.	Oun kii yoo ni anfani lati gba ohunkohun kọja rẹ.
Open and good to go.	Ṣii ati pe o dara lati lọ.
They don’t get them.	Wọn ko gba wọn.
They talk about it.	Wọn sọrọ ọrọ rẹ.
Maybe that doesn’t matter.	Boya iyẹn ko ṣe pataki.
Everyone thought it was very good.	Gbogbo eniyan ro pe o dara pupọ.
It is a very important game.	O jẹ ere pataki kan.
All of it.	Gbogbo re.
Some members have mistaken the system, saying it is not true.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti ṣe aṣiṣe eto naa, wọn sọ pe ko jẹ otitọ.
The said company will open soon.	Ile-iṣẹ ti a sọ yoo ṣii laipẹ.
We lost our first child after a month.	A padanu ọmọ akọkọ lẹhin oṣu kan.
One, obviously, is time.	Ọkan, o han ni, jẹ akoko.
There is no room for error.	Ko si aaye fun aṣiṣe.
My car is bad.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi ko dara.
It stands in its own way.	O duro ni ọna tirẹ.
I do not know what to say to him.	Emi ko mọ kini lati sọ fun u.
You get it and let it have what you want.	O gba o si jẹ ki o ni ohun ti o fẹ.
Please help me on this.	Jọwọ ran mi lọwọ lori eyi.
A lot of time is gone.	Akoko pupọ ti lọ.
And not now.	Ati ki o ko bayi.
It will not hurt.	Kii yoo ṣe ipalara.
I walk around.	Mo rin ni ayika.
It was not an opportunity.	O je ko anfani.
And not just any office.	Ati pe kii ṣe ọfiisi eyikeyi nikan.
Even from you.	Paapaa lati ọdọ rẹ.
I have had to change companies.	Mo ti ni lati yi awọn ile-iṣẹ pada.
I’m sure it didn’t go beyond help.	Mo daju pe o ko kọja iranlọwọ.
Others stood behind me.	Awọn miiran duro lẹhin mi.
Not in the back room, either.	Ko si ninu yara ẹhin, boya.
But this is not my place.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe aaye mi.
I will not let you go.	Emi ko ni jẹ ki o lọ.
Let it take care of itself.	Jẹ ki o tọju ara rẹ.
They do not need a lot of water.	Wọn ko nilo omi nla.
He said it was the best there was.	O sọ pe o dara julọ ti o wa.
I mean, not only that.	Mo tumọ si, kii ṣe bẹ nikan.
He wonders how they read that.	O ṣe iyalẹnu bawo ni wọn ṣe ka iyẹn.
I am the first.	Mi ni akọkọ.
Start here.	Bẹrẹ nibi.
You know that now.	O mọ iyẹn ni bayi.
He said he would visit again next week.	O sọ pe oun yoo tun ṣabẹwo si ni ọsẹ ti n bọ.
More on that below.	Diẹ sii lori iyẹn ni isalẹ.
I will try to change, for him.	Emi yoo gbiyanju lati yipada, fun u.
It is important about the way you eat your food.	O ṣe pataki nipa ọna ti o jẹ ounjẹ rẹ.
It has come through.	O ti wa nipasẹ.
We have yet to do so.	A ni sibẹsibẹ lati ṣe bẹ.
Let us be who we are.	Jẹ ki a jẹ ẹni ti a jẹ.
He came home.	O de ile.
I find this to be very true.	Mo rii pe eyi jẹ otitọ pupọ.
This is all we can do.	Eyi ni gbogbo ohun ti a le ṣe.
That they did so much with so little is surprising.	Pe wọn ṣe pupọ pẹlu diẹ diẹ jẹ iyalẹnu.
Room is not available.	Yara ko ba ti wa.
i'm happy	inu mi dun.
He is not only your son, but your friend now.	Oun kii ṣe ọmọ rẹ nikan, ṣugbọn ọrẹ rẹ ni bayi.
You may want to consider that.	O le fẹ lati ro pe.
Few feet.	Diẹ ni ẹsẹ.
They notice it.	Wọn ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
It is metal, not wood.	Irin ni, kii ṣe igi.
There is nothing on them.	Ko si nkankan lori wọn.
They take good care of it.	Wọn tọju rẹ daradara.
This is nothing.	Eyi kii ṣe nkankan.
It makes sense to me.	O ṣe oye fun mi.
But I am, and everyone like me, wants to accept.	Ṣugbọn emi ni, ati gbogbo eniyan bi mi, wọn fẹ lati gba.
Your own question is not complete.	Ibeere ti ara rẹ ko pari.
And they want me with them.	Ati pe wọn fẹ mi pẹlu wọn.
The smaller the people the better.	Awọn eniyan ti o kere julọ dara julọ.
No one has been seen for more than thirty years.	Ko si ọkan ti a ti ri fun o ju ọgbọn ọdun lọ.
Dad would be happy to see us there.	Inu baba yoo dun lati ri wa nibẹ.
We don’t want to be outside in the sun.	A ko fẹ lati wa ni ita ni oorun.
Just the best.	O kan ti dara ju.
At least that’s what it is.	O kere o jẹ ohun ti o jẹ.
Stop at the main road.	Duro ni opopona akọkọ.
We have to find these people before they know we are looking.	A ni lati wa awọn eniyan wọnyi ṣaaju ki wọn mọ pe a n wa.
When will they arrive?	Nigbawo ni wọn yoo de?
That seems to help.	Iyẹn dabi ẹni pe o ṣe iranlọwọ.
So we did.	Nitorina a ṣe.
Things to write about at this point.	Awọn nkan ti o kọ ni aaye yii.
This question is also unlikely to be true.	Ibeere yii tun ko ṣeeṣe lati jẹ otitọ.
Money on the table.	Owo lori tabili.
Take this, get well.	O mu eyi, gba daradara.
But one can never be sure of things at all.	Ṣugbọn ẹnikan ko le ni idaniloju awọn nkan rara.
This is the best food we have ever eaten.	Eyi ni ounjẹ to dara julọ ti a ti jẹ.
I know and like your father.	Mo mọ ati bi baba rẹ.
My love is a week.	Ifẹ mi jẹ ọsẹ kan.
But we did that three years ago.	Ṣugbọn a ṣe iyẹn ni ọdun mẹta sẹhin.
It depends on the woman.	O da lori obinrin naa.
And that may be true.	Ati pe iyẹn le jẹ otitọ.
There is no question that your friend is dying.	Ko si ibeere pe ọrẹ rẹ n ku.
And their eyes met.	Ati oju wọn pade.
That means you are doing the right thing.	Eyi tumọ si pe o n ṣe nkan ti o tọ.
Something went wrong.	Nkankan ti jẹ aṣiṣe.
Would be nice if others could see it too.	Yoo dara ti awọn miiran ba le rii paapaa.
So you want evil.	Nitorina o fẹ buburu.
I want to, you know that.	Mo fe, o mọ pe.
However it will be too late.	Sibẹsibẹ yoo pẹ ju.
But it can not.	Sugbon ko le.
But if you don’t, that’s fine.	Ṣugbọn ti o ko ba ṣe bẹ, o dara.
He believed that motherhood should mean love.	O gbagbọ pe iya yẹ ki o tumọ si ifẹ.
Do not understand.	Maṣe ṣe oye.
You have to find a wife.	O ni lati wa iyawo.
Moved to the first.	Ti gbe lọ si akọkọ.
However he had no power to stop her.	Sibẹsibẹ ko ni agbara lati da rẹ sọrọ.
You can.	O ti le.
I do not doubt myself at all.	Emi ko ṣiyemeji ara mi rara.
A community	A agbegbe
I think it's great.	Mo ro pe o dara julọ.
I was surprised, I thought about them.	Mo ya, mo ro nipa wọn.
That is the situation.	Ipo naa niyen.
The setting is always sunny and warm.	Eto naa jẹ oorun nigbagbogbo ati gbona.
They won’t let you stop.	Wọn kii yoo jẹ ki o duro.
She left her job to take care of children.	O fi iṣẹ rẹ silẹ lati tọju awọn ọmọde.
It was agreed to a fee and we paid.	O ti gba lati kan owo ati awọn ti a san.
All of these are true words.	Gbogbo eyi jẹ awọn ọrọ otitọ.
We left.	A fi silẹ.
He let his hand move across his standing body.	O jẹ ki ọwọ rẹ gbe kọja ara rẹ ti o duro.
So far few people understand it.	Titi di bayi diẹ eniyan diẹ loye rẹ.
There are some cars that look like cars too.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan wa ti o dabi awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ paapaa.
Someone did all that.	Ẹnikan ṣe gbogbo nkan naa.
After two weeks, her phone rang.	Lẹhin ọsẹ meji, foonu rẹ dun.
Maybe that is love.	Boya ife niyen.
The word means "to have".	Ọrọ naa tumọ si "lati ni".
However, as noted, this does not seem to be possible.	Sibẹsibẹ, bi a ti ṣe akiyesi, eyi ko dabi pe o ṣeeṣe.
Now, there is one eye for me.	Bayi, oju mi ​​kan wa.
We will continue to understand.	A yoo tẹsiwaju ni oye.
To turn my back on that power is wrong.	Lati yi ẹhin mi pada si agbara yẹn jẹ aṣiṣe.
This is the last place.	Eyi ni ibi ti o kẹhin.
You have seen it before.	O ti rii ṣaaju ki o to.
The idea is sweet.	Ero naa dun.
He died this morning.	O ku ni owurọ yi.
But don't be upset.	Ṣugbọn maṣe binu.
I am here to help you get this.	Mo wa nibi lati ran ọ lọwọ lati gba eyi.
He did in high school.	O ṣe ni ile-iwe giga.
This is our only time.	Eyi jẹ akoko wa nikan.
All we can do now is wait.	Gbogbo ohun ti a le ṣe ni bayi ni duro.
I like my hair.	Mo feran irun mi.
My life is good because it is in it.	Igbesi aye mi dara nitori pe o wa ninu rẹ.
I do not say much.	Emi ko sọ pupọ.
You can not believe.	O ko le gbagbọ.
That can.	Iyẹn le.
When he arrived.	Nigbati o de.
To do this you need to proceed.	Lati ṣe eyi o nilo lati tẹsiwaju.
We will go as soon as you wake up.	A yoo lọ ni kete ti o ba ji.
Before they did so.	Ṣaaju ki wọn to ṣe bẹ.
I wonder what will happen ?.	Mo Iyanu kini yoo ṣẹlẹ?.
We must return to the city.	A gbọdọ pada si ilu.
But it is too late.	Sugbon o ti pẹ ju.
He wants us to be in bed.	O fẹ wa lori ibusun.
They do not know where he lives.	Wọn ko mọ ibi ti o ngbe.
I want to see the game happen.	Mo fẹ lati rii ere naa ṣẹlẹ.
He didn't seem to notice what he was picking up.	O dabi pe ko ṣe akiyesi ohun rẹ ti gbe soke.
For some reason, he didn't really like these people.	Fun idi kan, ko fẹran awọn eniyan wọnyi gaan.
Write the question down.	Kọ ibeere naa silẹ.
I do not like to do.	Nko feran lati se.
Where can the woman go?	Nibo ni obinrin naa le lọ?
Sun it out.	Sun o jade.
It just is not possible.	O kan ko ṣee ṣe.
It sounds like a good idea to me.	O dabi imọran ti o dara fun mi.
Educate these people and learn from them.	Kọ ẹkọ awọn eniyan wọnyi ki o kọ ẹkọ lati ọdọ wọn.
I say where you live.	Mo sọ ibi ti o ngbe.
You have found the information.	O ti rii alaye naa.
I don't want to talk to him too much.	Emi ko fẹ lati ba a sọrọ pupọ.
But here it goes.	Sugbon nibi lọ.
I could see someone walking towards me.	Mo ti le ri ẹnikan ti o rin si mi.
Wake up before they do.	Ji ki wọn to ṣe.
This brings us to the present.	Eleyi mu wa si awọn bayi.
That is a fact.	Otitọ niyẹn.
And have fun.	Ati ki o ni fun.
Could it be better.	Ṣe o le dara julọ.
He has been trying to change me for many years.	O ti n gbiyanju lati yi mi pada fun ọdun pupọ.
It will come out.	Yoo jade.
Never forget them.	Maṣe gbagbe wọn lailai.
Look at it and stick to it.	Wo o ki o si duro si i.
I need money.	Mo nilo owo.
And that’s the end.	Ati pe iyẹn ni ipari.
You will make friends.	Iwọ yoo ṣe awọn ọrẹ.
They want something past.	Wọn fẹ nkan ti o kọja.
Well, it was that time again.	O dara, o jẹ akoko yẹn lẹẹkansi.
He would need someone to help him there.	Oun yoo fẹ ẹnikan lati ran u lọwọ nibẹ.
I don’t think about it at all.	Emi ko ronu nipa rẹ rara ju.
Please have a good life.	Jọwọ ni aye ti o dara.
I don’t think it will be hard.	Emi ko ro pe yoo jẹ lile.
I hope a lot of people will be angry.	Mo nireti pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan yoo binu.
This can cause problems.	Eyi le fa awọn iṣoro.
I like the fact that they are way too small.	Mo fẹran otitọ pe wọn wa ni ọna diẹ.
People ask you to stay.	Awọn eniyan beere pe ki o duro.
You really like this project.	O fẹ iṣẹ yii gaan.
I can say that because it is true.	Mo le sọ bẹ nitori pe o jẹ otitọ.
A big surprise.	Iyalẹnu nla kan.
As such, we used both methods.	Bi iru bẹẹ, a lo awọn ọna mejeeji.
He walked to the table.	O rin si tabili.
Everything you do in life is a team thing.	Ohun gbogbo ti o ṣe ni igbesi aye jẹ ohun ẹgbẹ kan.
Things start to look serious.	Ohun bẹrẹ lati wo pataki.
I do not know what to think.	Emi ko mọ kini lati ronu.
He is waiting for their friend's house.	O n duro de ile ọrẹ wọn.
It was not that there was anything to see at that time.	Kii ṣe pe ohunkohun wa lati rii ni akoko yẹn.
When he got home he changed.	Nigbati o de ile o yipada.
I don’t have time for everyone.	Emi ko ni akoko fun gbogbo eniyan.
I think life has become amazing.	Mo ro pe igbesi aye ti di iyanu.
We will leave in a minute.	A yoo lọ kuro ni iṣẹju kan.
He doesn't like to drive.	Ko feran lati wakọ.
You have already heard the bad news.	O ti gbọ iroyin buburu tẹlẹ.
It is not good to touch ourselves.	Ko dara lati kan ni ara wa.
Make no mistake.	Ko ṣe aṣiṣe.
But the police are there.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọlọpa wa nibẹ.
She is my mother.	Iya ninu mi ni.
This is the only road to town.	Eleyi jẹ nikan ni opopona si ilu.
You need to write.	O nilo lati kọ.
Just made my night.	O kan ṣe alẹ mi.
But the machine did not stop.	Ṣugbọn ẹrọ naa ko duro.
You will need to wait for a few more minutes.	Iwọ yoo nilo lati duro fun iṣẹju diẹ diẹ sii.
What about the seat?	Kini nipa ijoko?
Give him your job.	Fun u ni iṣẹ rẹ.
All the trees died near the road.	Gbogbo awọn igi ti ku nitosi ọna.
You can find another.	O le wa miiran.
He’s coming here right now.	O n bọ nibi ni bayi.
I can't wait if something happens to him.	Emi ko le duro ti nkan kan ba ṣẹlẹ si i.
So, too, with people.	Nitorina, ju, pẹlu eniyan.
Use any of these names.	Lo eyikeyi ninu awọn orukọ wọnyi.
I don’t even remember what it was about.	Emi ko paapaa ranti ohun ti o jẹ nipa.
Just left.	Kan fi silẹ.
I am better for a man.	Mo ti dara ju fun ọkunrin kan.
I can't go out like this.	Nko le jade bi eleyi.
I missed it, especially last year.	Mo ti padanu rẹ, paapaa ni ọdun to kọja.
There are several ways to do this.	Awọn ọna pupọ lo wa lati ṣe iyẹn.
They suspect a bad game.	Wọn fura si ere buburu.
I went for two weeks.	Mo ti lọ fun ọsẹ meji.
We give them everything.	A fun wọn ni ohun gbogbo.
I don't know what else to say.	Ko mọ kini ohun miiran lati sọ.
Let's get this over with!	Jẹ ká gba yi lori pẹlu!
A man and his dog, trying to make sense of it.	A ọkunrin ati awọn re aja, gbiyanju lati ṣe ori ti o.
We must do this now.	A gbọdọ ṣe eyi ni bayi.
They don’t move.	Wọn ko gbe.
Some are hard to find.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni o wa gidigidi lati ri.
It was hot and hot enough.	O je ooru ati ki o gbona to.
Or one by train and one by boat.	Tabi ọkan nipasẹ ọkọ oju irin ati ọkan nipasẹ ọkọ oju omi.
Bring your own if needed.	Mu ti ara rẹ ti o ba nilo.
He turned to his grandparents.	O yipada si awọn obi obi rẹ.
He put his hand into it.	O fi ọwọ rẹ sinu rẹ.
Now consider me this.	Bayi ro mi yi.
It gives us time to grow.	O fun wa ni akoko lati dagba.
Let him tell you a story about his life.	Jẹ ki o sọ itan kan fun ọ nipa igbesi aye rẹ.
Put the first thing first.	Fi akọkọ ohun akọkọ.
This is not the case.	Kii ṣe nkan yii.
This text has been written in the past.	A ti kọ ọrọ yii ni akoko ti o ti kọja.
You can not burn it.	O ko le sun o.
This is the key.	Eyi jẹ bọtini.
Tell others to keep.	Sọ fun awọn miiran lati tọju.
You have already talked to him.	O ti ba a sọrọ tẹlẹ.
And he had nothing to give me.	Ati pe ko ni nkankan lati fun mi.
I will miss our beach.	Emi yoo padanu eti okun wa.
Sometimes they look more like the other type.	Nigba miiran wọn dabi diẹ sii ju ti iru miiran lọ.
It is not my opinion.	Kii ṣe ero mi.
You have to help the team.	O ni lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun ẹgbẹ naa.
He wants me out.	O fẹ mi jade.
Not fast.	Ko sare.
I'm so sorry.	Mo wa bẹ, ma binu.
But that is the way this has changed.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ni ọna ti eyi yipada.
We have nothing to do with it.	A ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
I got a job.	Mo gba ise kan.
There is more to the story.	Nibẹ ni lati wa diẹ sii si itan naa.
The houses are well lit.	Awọn ile ti sun daradara.
Turn off the car.	Pa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kuro.
Never been up before.	Ko ti soke ṣaaju ki o to.
Now one thing.	Bayi ohun kan.
They make rules.	Wọn ṣe awọn ofin.
To date, no such test has been performed.	Titi di oni, iru idanwo bẹẹ ko ti ṣe.
He carried it.	O gbe e.
With food.	Pẹlu ounjẹ.
And not everything has to be about money.	Ati pe kii ṣe ohun gbogbo ni lati jẹ nipa owo.
He was a very good man.	O jẹ eniyan ti o dara julọ.
There are few men.	Awọn ọkunrin diẹ ni o wa.
But of all, no.	Ṣugbọn ti gbogbo rẹ, rara.
You can also contact here.	O tun le kan si nibi.
He was a long drive to his parents.	O jẹ awakọ pipẹ si awọn obi rẹ.
This can explain poor performance.	Eyi le ṣe alaye iṣẹ ṣiṣe ti ko dara.
They do not yet know who he is.	Wọn ko tii mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
If only true.	Ti o ba jẹ otitọ nikan.
It takes such a time.	O gba iru akoko kan.
He loves the game.	O nifẹ ere naa.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bi o ṣe le ṣe eyi.
Sometimes it passes.	Nigba miiran o kọja lọ.
It does not matter.	Ko ṣe akiyesi.
The woman opened it again and looked out.	Obinrin naa tun ṣi i o si wo jade.
We spent the month planning the trip.	A lo oṣu ti a gbero irin-ajo naa.
Say what you want to say.	Sọ ohun ti o fẹ ki o sọ.
When that happens your voice will work again.	Nigbati iyẹn ba ṣẹlẹ ohun rẹ yoo ṣiṣẹ lẹẹkansi.
Don't even ask.	Maṣe beere paapaa.
That key truth.	Otitọ bọtini kan yẹn.
No big problem.	Ko si iṣoro nla.
You will hurt yourself.	O yoo ṣe ipalara funrararẹ.
But he still said the same thing to me today.	Ṣugbọn o tun sọ ohun kanna fun mi loni.
Think of something good.	Ronu nipa nkan kan dara.
I see more of this than you.	Mo ri diẹ sii ninu eyi ju iwọ lọ.
I think people will love your picture.	Mo ro pe eniyan yoo nifẹ aworan rẹ.
I hope to see you your old one again soon.	Mo nireti lati ri ọ atijọ rẹ lẹẹkansi laipẹ.
The door opened in his eyes.	Ilẹkun naa ṣi silẹ ni oju rẹ.
Think this way.	Ronu ni ọna yii.
In the vicinity of the city, you will find high mountains.	Ni agbegbe ti o wa nitosi ilu naa, iwọ yoo wa awọn oke giga giga.
See if you can decide if you are still there.	Wo boya o le pinnu boya o tun wa nibẹ.
Take the big idea home.	Mu ero nla naa lọ si ile.
She is very anxious.	O ni aniyan gaan.
But he continued.	Ṣugbọn o tẹsiwaju.
We are three.	A jẹ mẹta.
We decided to wait for now.	A pinnu lati duro fun bayi.
She even surprised her family at first.	Paapaa o ṣe iyalẹnu idile rẹ ni akọkọ.
You have that thing forever.	O ni nkan yẹn lailai.
I have my new favorites.	Mo ni awọn ayanfẹ mi tuntun.
Which is possible.	Eyi ti o ṣee ṣe.
But there is nothing you can do.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o le ṣe.
He said nothing and kissed her.	Ko so nkankan ko si fi ẹnu ko o.
Not put on paper.	Ko fi si ori iwe.
Everyone is asking for it, of course.	Gbogbo eniyan n beere lọwọ rẹ, dajudaju.
That is unlikely to happen.	Iyẹn ko ṣeeṣe lati ṣẹlẹ.
That is how one would expect.	Iyẹn jẹ bi eniyan yoo nireti.
Not because they want to, but because they have to.	Kii ṣe nitori wọn fẹ, ṣugbọn nitori wọn ni lati.
No, it is for you.	Rara, o jẹ fun ọ.
Because sometimes he hates to eat them.	Nitori nigba miiran o korira lati jẹ wọn.
Very good.	O dara pupọ.
Take your time, do it the right way the first time.	Gba akoko rẹ, ṣe ni ọna ti o tọ ni igba akọkọ.
But he said they did not.	Ṣugbọn o sọ pe wọn ko.
OK insert.	Dara fi sii.
They worked the same thing.	Wọn ti ṣiṣẹ ohun kanna.
After the accident, he never recovered.	Lẹhin ijamba naa, ko gba pada rara.
Water is essential for life.	Omi jẹ pataki fun igbesi aye.
It is not possible, but it will take time and energy.	Ko ṣee ṣe, ṣugbọn yoo fa akoko ati agbara.
I did not ask him to accept membership.	Emi ko beere lọwọ rẹ lati gba ẹgbẹ.
This has always been your problem.	Eyi ti nigbagbogbo jẹ iṣoro rẹ.
He can.	O si le.
I have not put on small things.	Mo ti ko fi lori kekere ohun.
Now you can leave.	Bayi o le lọ kuro.
And we will change the world.	Ati pe a yoo yi aye pada.
There are many of them.	Ọpọlọpọ wọn wa.
All this, and you get the ball again !.	Gbogbo eyi, ati pe o gba bọọlu lẹẹkansi !.
In fact, he wasn’t sure he wanted to be.	Ni otitọ, ko ni idaniloju pe o fẹ lati wa.
Her tired face looked up.	Oju re ti o ti re wo soke.
We do not know yet.	A ko mọ sibẹsibẹ.
Maybe that's something you don't understand.	Boya ohun ti ko loye niyẹn.
In the last few months, they seem to be coming back every night.	Ni awọn oṣu diẹ ti o kẹhin, wọn dabi pe wọn n pada wa ni gbogbo alẹ.
And we have nothing to do.	Ati pe a ko ni nkankan lati ṣe.
A good night's rest is what you want.	Isinmi alẹ ti o dara ni ohun ti o fẹ.
The important thing is that we learn from them.	Ohun pataki ni pe a kọ ẹkọ lati ọdọ wọn.
It should not work in my opinion.	Ko yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ ni ero mi.
We ate, drank, and sometimes, we even talked.	A jẹun, mu, ati nigba miiran, a paapaa sọrọ.
If we walk away, fine.	Ti a ba rin kuro, o dara.
That’s why it’s fun to laugh.	Ti o ni idi ti o dun lati rẹrin.
It will be understandable.	Yoo jẹ oye.
It feels amazing, he said.	O ni imọran iyanu, o sọ.
Or use your picture.	Tabi lo aworan rẹ.
You can see and they can’t, they won’t understand.	O le rii ati pe wọn ko le, wọn kii yoo loye.
That will have to wait.	Iyẹn yoo ni lati duro.
They have life now, the future.	Wọn ni aye ni bayi, ọjọ iwaju.
The water is hot.	Omi naa gbona.
It was a very, very good book.	O jẹ pupọ, iwe ti o dara pupọ.
He has spoken it through me, and he has cast it into his life through me.	O ti sọ ọ nipasẹ mi, o si sọ ọ sinu aye rẹ nipasẹ mi.
We already talked.	A sọrọ tẹlẹ.
So we saw it.	Nitorina a ri i.
For some people this is very easy, for others it is very hard.	Fun diẹ ninu awọn eniyan eyi rọrun pupọ, fun awọn miiran lile pupọ.
To use them, you must use your imagination.	Lati lo wọn, o gbọdọ lo ero inu.
I can say.	Mo le sọ.
It is a matter of the city.	O jẹ ọrọ ilu naa.
I said something.	Mo sọ nkan.
These people are good.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi dara.
We can help people who need help.	A le ran eniyan ti o nilo iranlọwọ.
At least, this does.	O kere ju, eyi ṣe.
I have no idea where you got the money.	Emi ko ni imọran ibi ti o ti gba owo naa.
I would love the world to live that time again.	Emi yoo nifẹ aye lati gbe akoko yẹn lẹẹkansi.
She wants her parents back.	O fe awọn obi rẹ pada.
And you haven’t seen it in a few years.	Ati pe o ko tii ri i fun ọdun diẹ.
I want to see them grow.	Mo fẹ lati ri wọn dagba.
The water was clear and good.	Omi wà ko o ati ki o dara.
However, we did not do bad.	Sibẹsibẹ, a ko ṣe buburu.
His brother is real.	Arakunrin rẹ jẹ otitọ.
Whatever it is.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ.
You want to understand everything with your head.	O fẹ lati ni oye ohun gbogbo pẹlu ori rẹ.
I love doing things.	Mo nifẹ ṣiṣe awọn nkan.
He loves.	O ni ife.
I look at your face.	Mo wo oju rẹ.
Get your facts right.	Gba awọn otitọ rẹ tọ.
That is your job too.	Iyẹn ni iṣẹ tirẹ paapaa.
We know he will go to places.	A mọ pe yoo lọ si awọn aaye.
He may fear it but cannot believe it.	O le bẹru rẹ ṣugbọn ko le gbagbọ.
Not these days.	Kii ṣe awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
Of course, it works.	Dajudaju, o ṣiṣẹ.
To anything that already exists.	Si ohunkohun ti o wà tẹlẹ.
For those who are angry by this game do not be.	Fun awọn ti o binu nipasẹ ere yii maṣe jẹ.
Two were removed.	Meji ti yọ kuro.
There is a drink.	Ohun mimu wa.
He did not explain.	Ko ṣe alaye.
This is possible for two reasons.	Eyi ṣee ṣe fun idi meji.
We made your decision.	A ṣe ipinnu rẹ.
And drink from the river.	Ati ki o mu lati odo.
He is a special man these days.	O jẹ ọkunrin pataki ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
The price is good for what you get.	Iye owo naa dara fun ohun ti o gba.
They will be rejected.	Wọn yoo jẹ kọ.
It is a very good book.	Iwe ti o dara pupọ ni.
All thoughts are in them.	Gbogbo awọn ero inu wọn wa.
Tell him you can't read.	Sọ fun u pe o ko le ka.
The police will ask a few questions.	Ọlọpa yoo beere awọn ibeere diẹ.
A man went when the police asked.	Ọkunrin kan lọ nigbati awọn ọlọpa beere.
I do not really remember.	Emi ko ranti gaan.
You know the place.	O mọ ibi naa.
That is my job, to make this much easier anyone can do.	Iyẹn ni iṣẹ mi, lati jẹ ki eyi rọrun pupọ ẹnikẹni le ṣe.
If it is love, maybe it is.	Ti o ba jẹ ifẹ, boya o jẹ.
Once you get over to that, that's it.	Ni kete ti o gba lori si wipe, ti o ni wipe.
Let it grow.	Jẹ ki o dagba.
Some details may be out of date.	Diẹ ninu awọn alaye le jẹ ti ọjọ.
That doesn’t work here.	Iyẹn ko ṣiṣẹ nibi.
I lost everything because of it.	Mo padanu ohun gbogbo nitori rẹ.
It's been a week, maybe two.	O ti kọja ọsẹ kan, o ṣee ṣe meji.
The rules have changed.	Awọn ofin ti yipada.
Of course not.	Dajudaju o ko ni.
I went to school here.	Mo ti lọ si ile-iwe nibi.
That is the kind of thing that must be stopped now.	Iyẹn ni iru nkan ti o gbọdọ da duro bayi.
And he was alone.	Ati awọn ti o wà nikan.
So it is very simple.	Nitorina o rọrun pupọ.
He is not a self-sacrificing person.	Oun kii ṣe ẹni ti o fi ara rẹ silẹ.
How to try to find out?	Bawo ni lati gbiyanju lati wa jade?
Why not, he said.	Kilode ti kii ṣe, o sọ.
Last time.	Igba ikẹhin.
We have to wait now.	A ni lati duro ni bayi.
All the time.	Ni gbogbo igba.
Who can remember.	Tani o le ranti.
Get to know this life.	Gba lati mọ igbesi aye yii.
Do this now!	Ṣe eyi ni bayi!
The money of a single person.	Awọn owo ti a nikan eniyan.
The door opened slightly.	Ilẹkun naa ṣi silẹ diẹ.
None of them knew what to do.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn mọ ohun lati ṣe.
I need this today.	Mo nilo eyi loni.
Something is there now.	Nkankan wa nibẹ ni bayi.
He had moved to stay in the office for that purpose.	O ti gbe lati duro ni ọfiisi fun idi yẹn.
You see it does not need to be done.	O rii pe ko nilo lati ṣe.
Not already there.	Ko ti wa nibẹ tẹlẹ.
We want to hear from you.	A fẹ gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
Hit the settings.	Lu awọn eto.
He presented himself as a doctor but did not give another name.	O fi ara rẹ han bi dokita kan ṣugbọn ko fun orukọ miiran.
Happens more than you want to know.	Ṣẹlẹ diẹ sii ju ti o fẹ lati mọ.
Nothing can be done for him, not yet.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe fun u, ko sibẹsibẹ.
This works well.	Eyi ṣiṣẹ daradara.
He said they would.	O sọ pe wọn yoo.
One day they will get us.	Ni ọjọ kan wọn yoo gba wa.
Some people are angry.	Awọn eniyan kan binu.
There are many players you can meet and make friends with.	Nibẹ ni o wa ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹrọ orin ti o le pade ki o si ṣe ọrẹ pẹlu.
They can be yours if.	Wọn le jẹ tirẹ ti o ba .
That's good.	Iyẹn dara.
In other words, you need to know something to read.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, o nilo lati mọ nkan lati ka.
He sat and sat down.	O joko o si joko.
You are down with that.	O wa ni isalẹ pẹlu iyẹn.
I do not tell my family.	Emi ko so fun ara mi ebi.
I read that.	Mo ka pe.
What it will do is help your energy.	Ohun ti yoo ṣe ni iranlọwọ agbara rẹ.
You want to go home.	O fẹ lati lọ si ile.
We can agree on one thing.	A le gba lori ohun kan.
That's what they all do.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo wọn ṣe.
You can see a better future.	O le rii ọjọ iwaju to dara julọ.
Things have changed since then.	Awọn nkan ti yipada lati igba ti o ti lọ.
Three of them.	Awọn mẹta ti wọn.
Special teams picked us all up.	Awọn ẹgbẹ pataki gbe gbogbo wa soke.
And they ended up together.	Ati pe wọn pari papọ.
We’re just getting started.	A n kan bẹrẹ.
And he learned.	Ati pe o kọ ẹkọ.
I spent some time in this house.	Mo lo akoko diẹ ninu ile yii.
Maybe my father's name will be on it.	Boya orukọ baba mi yoo wa lori rẹ.
No, not again.	Rara, kii ṣe lẹẹkansi.
When you look your best, you will feel your best.	Nigba ti o ba wo ti o dara ju, o yoo lero rẹ ti o dara ju.
Worried about it.	Ni aniyan nipa rẹ.
The player cannot fly.	Ẹrọ orin ko le fo.
You have to find the best way to find out where they are.	O gbọdọ wa ọna ti o dara julọ lati wa ibi ti wọn wa.
Do you see the hair?	Ṣe o ri awọn irun?
Whatever you need, just let me know.	Ohunkohun ti o nilo, kan jẹ ki mi mọ.
I can say that a lot.	Mo le sọ iyẹn pupọ.
I have never seen such a great policeman in my life.	Ko ri iru ọlọpa nla bẹ ninu igbesi aye mi.
He is a man who is true to everyone.	Oun ni ọkunrin ti o jẹ otitọ fun gbogbo eniyan.
He thought they would be too high.	O ro pe wọn yoo ga julọ.
And he hated it.	O si korira rẹ.
Life has changed.	Igbesi aye ti yipada.
I don't tell anyone.	Nko so fun enikeni rara.
They will do for you some good there.	Wọn yoo ṣe fun ọ diẹ ninu awọn ti o dara nibẹ.
Very much in his father's picture.	Pupọ ni aworan baba rẹ.
Get out of the house.	Jade kuro ni ile.
Well, really two.	Daradara, gan meji.
They just have word of mouth and pictures.	Wọn kan ni ọrọ ẹnu ati awọn aworan.
And he thought.	Ati pe o ro.
You made a lot of mistakes, though.	O ṣe aṣiṣe pupọ, paapaa.
How many women?	Obinrin melo ni?.
They have a lot of power in this house.	Wọn ni agbara pupọ ninu ile yii.
I do not really want.	Emi ko fẹ gaan.
But how much will it cost ?.	Ṣugbọn Elo ni yoo jẹ?.
So many have died.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ ti ku.
I sit, you stand.	Mo joko, o duro.
He has no power left.	Ko ni agbara kankan ti o ku.
A desire for the future.	A ifẹ fun ojo iwaju.
Or myself for that matter.	Tabi ara mi fun ọrọ yẹn.
Think about this yourself.	Ronu nipa eyi funrararẹ.
This made the driver angry.	Eyi mu ki awakọ naa binu.
He says we need to be more aggressive.	O sọ pe a nilo lati jẹ buburu diẹ sii.
None of them are working.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti wa ni iṣẹ.
Good job with that.	Iṣẹ to dara pẹlu iyẹn.
We do not know what they want.	A ko mọ ohun ti wọn fẹ.
The world, you know, broke many men.	Aye, o mọ, fọ ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkunrin.
Always away from home.	Nigbagbogbo kuro lati ile.
My house is beautiful.	Ile mi lẹwa.
We learn from you.	A kọ ẹkọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
Everyone is looking their way.	Gbogbo eniyan n wa ọna wọn.
Stay with us, everyone.	Duro wa pẹlu, gbogbo eniyan.
He said it was hot.	O sọ pe o gbona.
If you tell me you don't want to, he'll keep his word.	Ti o ba sọ fun mi pe ko fẹ, yoo pa ọrọ rẹ mọ.
The sister was beautiful, she thought.	Arabinrin naa lẹwa, o ro.
There are songs about it.	Awọn orin wa nipa rẹ.
We will not accept anyone.	A o gba enikeni.
It’s a small space.	O jẹ aaye kekere kan.
I still don't.	Nko ka rara.
In other places, life goes on.	Ni awọn aaye miiran, igbesi aye n tẹsiwaju.
It's just my body.	Ara mi kan ni.
So he stayed home and both sides were happy.	Nitorina o duro si ile ati pe ẹgbẹ mejeeji dun.
And not so sure of yourself.	Ati ki o ko ki daju ti ara rẹ.
You have to do it yourself.	O gbọdọ ṣe funrararẹ.
They dropped into our dinner.	Wọn lọ silẹ sinu ounjẹ alẹ wa.
He is also young.	O tun jẹ ọdọ.
It is not for us to understand.	Ko ṣe fun wa lati ni oye.
After that he returned to his normal position.	Lẹhin eyi o pada si ipo ti o yẹ.
The reason is very simple.	Idi naa rọrun pupọ.
Maybe they broke up with him.	Boya wọn fọ pẹlu rẹ.
I will write it myself.	Emi yoo kọ ọ funrararẹ.
When asked how he came to be, he refused.	Nigbati a beere bawo ni o ṣe wa, o kọ.
Someone with him.	Ẹnikan pẹlu rẹ.
A really nice one, too, for a while.	A gan dara ọkan, ju, fun a nigba ti.
The story is nothing.	Itan naa kii ṣe nkankan.
They do not need a meal.	Wọn ko nilo ounjẹ kan.
These are three ways.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn ọna mẹta.
On the surface of the earth.	Lori oke aye.
Parents give up and buy them.	Obi fun soke ati ki o ra wọn.
We only need rest at night.	A nilo isinmi nikan ni alẹ.
No words anymore, now is the time to do it.	Ko si awọn ọrọ mọ, bayi ni akoko lati ṣe.
That really helped me.	Iyẹn ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi gaan.
It takes time, but it is well worth it.	O gba akoko, sugbon o jẹ daradara tọ o.
From my mouth.	Lati inu ẹnu mi.
You have been asked to leave the position.	O ti ni ki o fi ipo silẹ.
You may not need them all.	O le ma nilo gbogbo wọn.
And so ended this journey.	Ati bẹ pari irin-ajo yii.
I have to live now, not in the past.	Mo ni lati gbe ni bayi, kii ṣe ti o ti kọja.
The trees will stand and just stand.	Awọn igi yoo duro ati ki o kan duro.
Many methods have been restored.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna ti a ti tun pada.
They feel other things are more powerful.	Wọn lero awọn ohun miiran diẹ sii ni agbara.
These are not, but they get better and better, and it's fun.	Awọn wọnyi ko, sugbon ti won gba dara ati ki o dara, ati awọn ti o ni fun.
You really want that.	O fẹ iyẹn pupọ.
Maybe a historic day.	Boya ọjọ itan kan.
That value is obvious.	Iye yẹn han gbangba.
Two people died here.	Eniyan meji ku nibi.
We hear these stories.	A gbọ awọn itan wọnyi.
I want to see how it looks.	Mo fe wo bi o ti ri.
It started well.	O bẹrẹ daradara.
But this is enough to start things off.	Ṣugbọn eyi ti to lati bẹrẹ awọn nkan.
It's too high.	O ti ga ga.
And for some reason, not least.	Ati fun idi diẹ, ko kere.
See where it took us.	Wo ibi ti o ti mu wa.
He thought he could not live without them.	O ro pe oun ko le gbe laisi wọn.
I know how much you want such a thing.	Mo mọ iye ti o fẹ iru nkan bẹẹ.
Take them up.	Ya wọn soke.
Can you give me more money?	Ṣe o le fun mi ni owo diẹ sii?
It was well still.	O je daradara si tun.
They come into other things.	Wọn wa sinu awọn nkan miiran.
A better future.	A dara ojo iwaju.
People get it really well.	Eniyan gba o gan daradara.
He is in the office now.	O wa ni ọfiisi bayi.
Those who appear in their final year test can also apply.	Awọn ti o han ni idanwo ọdun ikẹhin wọn tun le lo.
I want to do a lot of things.	Mo fẹ ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
I mean, we do services for other people who come and ask.	Mo tumọ si, a ṣe awọn iṣẹ fun awọn eniyan miiran ti o wa ati beere.
The contract period is over.	Akoko adehun ti pari.
Whatever my team needs me to do.	Ohunkohun ti ẹgbẹ mi nilo mi lati ṣe.
But in a way that doesn’t matter.	Ṣugbọn ni ọna ti ko ṣe pataki.
I believe it will be so.	Mo ti gbagbọ pe yoo jẹ bẹ.
I like making up tracks.	Mo fẹran ṣiṣe awọn orin soke.
It was the last time.	O kẹhin akoko.
You are the one who has power now.	Iwọ ni ẹniti o ni agbara ni bayi.
We started this journey together we will end it together.	A bẹrẹ irin-ajo yii papọ a yoo pari rẹ papọ.
In fact, we have already benefited from this.	Ni otitọ, a ti ni anfani tẹlẹ lati eyi.
That brings us to the real house.	Iyẹn mu wa si ile gaan.
It doesn’t have enough money to keep forever.	Ko ni owo ti o to lati tọju lailai.
Who is the first?	Tani o wa ni akọkọ?
They were not in a hurry to meet us.	Wọn ko yara lati pade wa.
Neither sleep.	Bẹni ko sun.
You are not important.	Iwọ kii ṣe nkan pataki.
He will have something to say to others.	Oun yoo ni nkankan lati sọ fun awọn miiran.
Either way, it won’t happen.	Ọna boya, kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
In life.	Ni igbesi aye.
Values ​​by other means are shown, especially.	Awọn iye nipasẹ awọn ọna miiran ti han, paapaa.
This poor diet weakens our energy.	Ounjẹ ti ko dara yii sọ agbara wa di.
Neither did my parents.	Bẹni awọn obi mi ko ṣe.
Some outside as well.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti ita bi daradara.
He will not rise.	Ko ni dide.
Remember to put yourself in your shoes.	Ranti lati fi ara rẹ sinu bata rẹ.
There is no going back.	Ko si lilọ pada.
It arrived after everyone was gone.	O de lẹhin ti gbogbo eniyan ti lọ.
I would of course read more.	Emi yoo dajudaju ka diẹ sii.
Call their office.	Pe wọn ọfiisi.
We need to talk.	A nilo lati sọrọ.
I will not wait for that.	Emi kii yoo duro fun iyẹn.
The city now has three supermarkets.	Ilu naa ni awọn ile itaja nla mẹta ni bayi.
I should add that information.	Mo yẹ ki n fi alaye yẹn kun.
He opened his office.	O ṣii ọfiisi rẹ.
No one was home.	Ko si ọkan wà ile.
This may be more than words.	Eyi le jẹ diẹ sii ju ọrọ lọ.
To a,.	To a, .
Some can be used when you decide to have a baby.	Diẹ ninu awọn le ṣee lo nigbati o ba pinnu lati mu ọmọ jade.
I can't just keep that.	Emi ko le kan pa iyẹn mọ.
I don’t want to do this all the time.	Emi ko fẹ lati ṣe eyi ni gbogbo igba.
I wish you could have met her.	Mo fẹ pe o le ti pade rẹ.
I planned to take them home after the game, but we lost.	Mo gbero lati mu wọn lọ si ile lẹhin ere, ṣugbọn a padanu.
But things changed.	Ṣugbọn awọn nkan yipada.
You cannot change other people.	O ko le yi awọn eniyan miiran pada.
Well enough, obviously.	Daradara to, o han ni.
This can be a problem.	Eyi le jẹ iṣoro kan.
You want to really try.	O fẹ gbiyanju gaan.
Not your mother.	Kii ṣe iya rẹ.
The water is almost finished.	A ti fẹrẹ pari omi.
I have all the boats for myself.	Mo ni gbogbo ọkọ oju omi fun ara mi.
It made the world a beautiful place.	O ṣe aye kan lẹwa ibi.
You are alone in it.	O ti wa ninu rẹ nikan.
It is nothing new.	Kii ṣe nkan tuntun.
He said something to them.	O sọ nkankan fun wọn.
Locals have not seen rain this year.	Awọn agbegbe ko ri ojo ni ọdun yii.
Let’s see about that.	Jẹ ki a wo nipa iyẹn.
Sometimes, error can be the best thing to happen.	Nigba miiran, aṣiṣe le jẹ ohun ti o dara julọ lati ṣẹlẹ.
I don’t have much longer.	Emi ko ni Elo to gun.
You have read an old newspaper.	O ti ka iwe iroyin atijọ kan.
We were tested in the office.	A ṣe idanwo wa ni ọfiisi.
They love to fast.	Wọn nifẹ pupọ lati yara yara.
Of course not.	Dajudaju o ko ni.
But not forever.	Sugbon ko lailai.
The city, he knew, could not go this way.	Ilu naa, o mọ pe, ko le lọ ni ọna yii.
Your location is not available.	Ipo rẹ ko wa.
You’ve done this before, of course.	O ti ṣe eyi ṣaaju, dajudaju.
His thinking did not change as they continued their program.	Ero rẹ ko yipada bi wọn ṣe tẹsiwaju eto wọn.
He waited until morning.	O duro titi di owurọ.
We talked about the weather.	A sọrọ nipa oju ojo.
Only decisions can change a person’s reality.	Awọn ipinnu nikan le yi otitọ eniyan pada.
And it’s a job that seems to be really enjoyable.	Ati pe o jẹ iṣẹ ti o dabi pe o gbadun gaan.
I give you the key.	Mo fun ọ ni bọtini.
We will see.	A yoo ri.
Close the table.	Pari tabili.
O lu o.	O lu o.
But this is easy to imagine.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ rọrun lati ro ero.
Separate yourself from the thought.	Ya ara rẹ kuro ninu ero naa.
I'm a little upset.	Mo binu diẹ.
I may have to try that.	Mo le ni lati gbiyanju iyẹn.
This time with someone better.	Ni akoko yii pẹlu ẹnikan ti o dara julọ.
We will start again.	A yoo bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
I think this is the way to go.	Mo ro pe eyi ni ọna lati lọ.
It may be possible, but it is not easy.	O le ṣee ṣe, ṣugbọn kii ṣe rọrun.
Most of them are women.	Pupọ ninu wọn ni awọn obinrin.
This will help with the problem.	Eyi yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun iṣoro naa.
Turn off the heat if needed.	Pa ooru silẹ ti o ba nilo.
You missed me.	O padanu mi.
This is a bad idea.	Eyi jẹ imọran ti ko dara.
Read the songs here.	Ka awọn orin nibi.
I need it more than ever now.	Mo nilo rẹ diẹ sii ju lailai bayi.
You want to go do something else.	O fẹ lati lọ ṣe nkan miiran.
You do not want to ask.	O ko fẹ beere.
And no one means anyone.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti o tumọ si ẹnikan.
We should be angry with each other.	A yẹ ki o binu si ara wa.
I can make you believe anything.	Mo le jẹ ki o gbagbọ ohunkohun.
And this happens whether you like it or not.	Ati pe eyi ṣẹlẹ boya o fẹran rẹ tabi rara.
For them it is obvious.	Fun wọn o han gbangba.
You have done with that.	O ti ṣe pẹlu iyẹn.
They can feel it.	Wọn le lero rẹ.
So, there you go.	Nitorina, nibẹ ni o lọ.
He is hard to get at.	O si jẹ gidigidi lati gba ni.
And so the weeks went by.	Ati bẹ awọn ọsẹ lọ.
He closed his eyes not trying to think anything.	O di oju rẹ ko gbiyanju lati ronu ohunkohun.
This car is worth more than the last one.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yii tọ diẹ sii ju ti o kẹhin lọ.
I don't want to go back.	Emi ko fẹ lati pada.
It has already been pulled out.	Ti o ti fa jade tẹlẹ.
It could not be anything else.	Ko le jẹ nkan miiran.
It was summer time.	O je akoko ooru.
Your position allows you to use a lot of energy.	Ipo rẹ jẹ ki o lo agbara pupọ.
If you are good at them, they are good to you.	Ti o ba dara si wọn, wọn dara fun ọ.
I am not afraid of him.	Emi ko bẹru rẹ.
And so it happened.	Ati bẹ o ṣẹlẹ.
Just give me a few minutes.	Kan fun mi ni iṣẹju diẹ.
He refuses to eat anything else.	O kọ lati jẹ ohunkohun miiran.
For you are now letting them go.	Fun o ti wa ni bayi jẹ ki wọn lọ.
But he heard what he said.	Ṣugbọn o gbọ ohun ti o sọ.
Well maybe now it is.	Daradara boya bayi o jẹ.
No one has heard from him since.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ lati igba naa.
But, what we do not know is why.	Ṣugbọn, ohun ti a ko mọ ni idi.
A friend met us at the station.	Ọrẹ kan pade wa ni ibudo naa.
So it is near.	Nitorina o wa nitosi.
Maybe he'll fly, maybe he won't.	Boya yoo fo, boya ko ni.
Maybe it’s anything.	Boya o jẹ ohunkohun.
There is nothing wrong with it.	Ko si ohun ti ko tọ si pẹlu rẹ.
Two more went soon after.	Meji miiran lọ laipẹ lẹhin naa.
Anyone could have had that in their home.	Ẹnikẹni le ti ni iyẹn ni ile wọn.
It is not your place to do anything.	Kii ṣe aaye rẹ lati ṣe ohunkohun.
That is not your job.	Iyẹn kii ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
Everyone was on edge.	Gbogbo eniyan wà lori eti.
You need to.	O nilo.
We have a lot of amazing programs.	A ni ọpọlọpọ awọn eto iyanu.
That’s the story of the trip.	Iyẹn ni awọn itan irin-ajo naa.
In your opinion.	Ni ero rẹ.
They need a lot of help.	Wọn nilo iranlọwọ pupọ.
That is my hometown.	Iyẹn ni ilu ile mi.
Get out of here.	Jade kuro.
They’re making sense.	Wọn n ṣe oye.
I think it is really good for anyone.	Mo ro pe o dara gaan fun ẹnikẹni.
I think he always brought it to him.	Mo ro pe o nigbagbogbo mu ọ fun u.
Just clean yourself up.	O kan nu ara rẹ soke.
So think, and act.	Nitorina ronu, ki o si ṣe.
I don’t want to be your friend.	Emi ko fẹ lati jẹ ọrẹ rẹ.
I'm doing great.	Mo n ṣe nla.
They will last for several months.	Wọn yoo tọju fun ọpọlọpọ awọn oṣu.
I am not convinced that we should try to have another child soon.	Emi ko da mi loju pe o yẹ ki a gbiyanju lati bi ọmọ miiran laipẹ.
You have heard this word before.	O ti gbọ ọrọ yii tẹlẹ.
You have heard me speak.	O ti gbọ ti mo sọrọ.
The image has not been restored.	Aworan naa ko tii tun pada.
Children learn as much as their parents do.	Awọn ọmọde kọ ẹkọ pupọ bi awọn obi wọn ti ṣe.
We may never have this opportunity again.	A le ma ni anfani yi lẹẹkansi.
There is so much to do!	Ọpọlọpọ wa lati ṣe!
I just want to know where it is.	Mo kan fẹ lati mọ ibiti o wa.
Life is as good as it can be.	Igbesi aye dara bi o ti le jẹ.
But someone will not.	Ṣugbọn ẹnikan yoo ko.
I played a game with them.	Mo ti ṣe ere kan pẹlu wọn.
But he is too tired to continue.	Ṣugbọn o ti rẹ pupọ lati tẹsiwaju.
That happens maybe a lot more than people realize.	Iyẹn ṣẹlẹ boya pupọ diẹ sii ju awọn eniyan mọ.
Girls should see and not hear.	Awọn ọmọbirin yẹ ki o rii ati ki o ko gbọ.
And you already have one.	Ati pe o ti ni ọkan tẹlẹ.
I believe in his words at first.	Mo gbagbọ ninu awọn ọrọ rẹ ni akọkọ.
City for me.	Ilu fun mi.
Her face is beautiful.	Oju rẹ jẹ lẹwa.
We will never forget our time spent here.	A ko ni gbagbe akoko wa ti a lo nibi.
That's not the point.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti o ṣe pataki.
After that we are sure to meet again before very long.	Lẹhin iyẹn a ni idaniloju lati pade lẹẹkansi ṣaaju pipẹ pupọ.
I am not good.	Emi ko dara.
It's really beautiful.	O lẹwa gaan.
The sister was right.	Arabinrin naa tọ.
That’s the way it sounds to me.	Iyẹn ni ọna ti o dun si mi.
He’s doing his best.	O n ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
To start everything again, he thought.	Lati bẹrẹ ohun gbogbo lẹẹkansi, o ro.
He was almost like that little brother.	O fẹrẹ dabi iru arakunrin kekere yẹn.
It will come out of your body in three days.	O yoo jade kuro ninu ara rẹ ni ọjọ mẹta.
Everything used to work fine until a few weeks ago.	Ohun gbogbo lo lati ṣiṣẹ daradara titi di ọsẹ diẹ sẹhin.
I have always loved this song.	Mo ti nigbagbogbo feran orin yi.
Even you were.	Paapaa iwọ wà.
No, of course not today.	Rara, dajudaju kii ṣe loni.
It was his decision.	O jẹ ipinnu rẹ.
This is another great.	Eyi jẹ nla miiran.
Your problem will come.	Iṣoro rẹ yoo wa.
The news sounds good to them.	Awọn iroyin dun si wọn.
It could not be, he said to himself.	Ko le jẹ, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
But, he said, the celebration served its purpose.	Ṣugbọn, o sọ pe, ayẹyẹ naa ṣiṣẹ idi rẹ.
People go through things, their lives change, they are not the same person.	Awọn eniyan lọ nipasẹ awọn nkan, igbesi aye wọn yipada, wọn kii ṣe eniyan kanna.
You don’t want to tell me, you don’t have to.	O ko fẹ sọ fun mi, o ko ni lati.
There is a man who looks to the future.	Ọkunrin kan wa ti o wo ọjọ iwaju.
It is love.	O jẹ ifẹ.
You will, too.	Iwọ yoo, paapaa.
I do not know how to get us out of this last one.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe le yọ wa kuro ninu eyi ti o kẹhin.
It was dropped and dropped.	A gbe e silẹ a si sọ ọ silẹ.
This test is very difficult.	Idanwo yii nira pupọ.
Spend more time with people.	Lo akoko diẹ sii pẹlu eniyan.
There is something important to explain.	Ohun pataki kan wa lati ṣe alaye.
So they are talking.	Nitorina wọn ba wa sọrọ.
You can get what’s coming to you yourself.	O le gba ohun ti n bọ si ọ funrararẹ.
This type of device is often used in cars.	Iru ẹrọ yii ni a lo nigbagbogbo ninu awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
It was hard at first.	O je lile ni akọkọ.
People have to eat to live.	Eniyan gbọdọ jẹun lati gbe.
You want to come to that already.	O fẹ lati wa si iyẹn tẹlẹ.
I look at them and I like what they have.	Mo wo wọn ati pe mo fẹ ohun ti wọn ni.
I can't say.	Nko le so.
The cottage has two rooms.	Ile kekere naa ni awọn yara meji.
Maybe they all went out to find his father.	Boya gbogbo wọn jade lati wa baba rẹ.
I did not return to class.	Emi ko pada si kilasi.
And well you can.	Ati daradara o le.
Nothing else.	Ko si ohun miiran.
For others, it was the first time we had been given.	Fun awọn miiran, o jẹ igba akọkọ akoko ti a ti fun.
It costs less.	O ni owo diẹ.
For that there must be words, but words without reason.	Fun iyẹn gbọdọ jẹ awọn ọrọ, ṣugbọn awọn ọrọ laisi idi.
It's your book.	Iwe rẹ ni.
I'm not sure.	Ko da mi loju.
He can never buy a book.	Ko le ra iwe rara.
And that's quite interesting.	Ati awọn ti o ni ohun ti awon.
I need your help.	Mo nilo iranlọwọ rẹ.
They want to make sure they do well.	Wọn fẹ lati rii pe wọn ṣe daradara.
What should you not do?	Kini o ko yẹ ki o ṣe?
The text can be found here.	Ọrọ le ṣee ri nibi.
I can't make it better.	Nko le mu ki o dara ju.
It’s just not a pretty thing to learn.	O kan kii ṣe ohun lẹwa lati kọ ẹkọ.
And you don’t like the guy.	Ati pe iwọ ko fẹran ọmọkunrin naa.
I hate it at home.	Mo korira rẹ ni ile.
She saw him raise his little hand.	O ri i ti o gbe ọwọ kekere rẹ soke.
I may be completely wrong, the coming days will tell us more.	Mo le jẹ aṣiṣe patapata, awọn ọjọ ti n bọ yoo sọ fun wa diẹ sii.
I was there when it opened.	Mo wa nibẹ nigbati o ṣii.
The money goes to love.	Awọn owo lọ si ifẹ.
But without it.	Ṣugbọn laisi rẹ.
However, they may not.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn le ma ṣe.
He loves tall women.	O nifẹ awọn obinrin ti o ga.
Just one head up to the other.	Kan kan ori soke si awọn miiran.
Man is allowed to live.	A fi aye fun eniyan ki o le gbe.
Let them bring themselves out.	Jẹ ki wọn mu ara wọn jade.
I know these people.	Mo mọ awọn eniyan wọnyi.
Not yes.	Ko ni bẹni.
Someone will come.	Ẹnikan yoo wa.
That hasn’t happened either.	Iyẹn ko ti ṣẹlẹ boya.
And have another.	Ati ki o ni miiran.
She loves this man.	O nifẹ ọkunrin yii.
Money and girls sent to you every week is good, especially.	Owo ati awọn ọmọbirin ti a fi ranṣẹ si ọ ni gbogbo ọsẹ jẹ dara, paapaa.
You always find your way with a lot of people and situations.	Nigbagbogbo o wa ọna rẹ pẹlu ọpọlọpọ eniyan ati awọn ipo.
Good! 	O dara!
For me, the truth is enough.	Fun mi, otitọ ti to.
That afternoon, a feeling of story was almost made.	Ni ọsan yẹn, itan rilara kan ti fẹrẹ ṣe.
Someone like him.	Ẹnikan ti o dabi rẹ.
But that is not true.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
And you, too.	Ati iwọ, paapaa.
At least we can get over that.	O kere ju a le gba lori iyẹn.
Such a question is not appropriate.	Iru ibeere bẹẹ ko yẹ.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	O dabi ẹni pe o n ra akoko.
You look down into the water.	O wo isalẹ sinu omi.
The moments you want to lose yourself are thoughts.	Awọn akoko ti o fẹ padanu ara rẹ ni awọn ero.
And it is still active.	Ati ki o jẹ ṣi lọwọ.
He really liked that person.	O fẹran eniyan naa gaan.
You hate anything you have to deal with.	O korira ohunkohun ti o ni lati tọju pẹlu.
Not looking at him, he met her hand and grabbed her.	Ko wo i, o pade ọwọ rẹ o si mu u.
You will lose.	Iwọ yoo padanu.
I need to see you get it back.	Mo nilo lati rii pe o gba pada.
However, it did not work.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko ṣiṣẹ.
Dog	Aja
We think two things should be possible.	A ro pe ohun meji yẹ ki o ṣee.
He looked me in the eye.	O fi oju kekere wo mi.
He is one with everything, completely.	O jẹ ọkan pẹlu ohun gbogbo, patapata.
First, the amount of time.	Ni akọkọ, iye akoko.
That way, he said.	Ni ọna yẹn, o sọ.
Everything about it was completely over the top.	Ohun gbogbo nipa rẹ wà patapata lori oke.
This can be done.	Eyi le ṣee ṣe.
I loved it when a man opened the car door.	Mo fẹran rẹ nigbati ọkunrin kan ṣi ilẹkun ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
Would love to hear the story.	Yoo nifẹ lati gbọ itan naa.
It may also be the first.	O tun le jẹ akọkọ.
Missing material in words.	Ohun elo ti o padanu ni awọn ọrọ.
To know each other.	Lati mọ ara wọn.
There is no need to die anymore.	Ko si nilo lati ku mọ.
Clothes are ironed out well.	Aṣọ ti wa ni irin jade daradara.
He hopes it is.	O nireti pe o jẹ.
I walked out of the restaurant.	Mo jade kuro ni ile ounjẹ naa.
Something is wrong with it.	Nkankan ko tọ nipa rẹ.
Nothing can stop us now.	Ko si ohun ti o le da wa duro ni bayi.
She loves to read on the couch.	O nifẹ lati ka lori ibusun.
This is nothing new, however.	Eyi kii ṣe nkan tuntun, sibẹsibẹ.
Accept this fact.	Gba otitọ yii.
But this is not the way to go.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe ọna lati lọ.
All this.	Gbogbo nkan yi.
You may have got anything you wanted to eat.	O le ti ni ohunkohun ti o fe lati je.
The time has passed.	Akoko naa ti kọja.
This cannot continue.	Eyi ko le tẹsiwaju.
Two years have passed since that night.	Ọdun meji ti kọja lati alẹ yẹn.
Wait a few days you say.	Duro kan diẹ ọjọ ti o sọ.
It would be a mistake.	Yoo jẹ pe o ṣe aṣiṣe.
You know this.	O mọ eyi.
The issue went well.	Ọrọ naa lọ daradara.
Their life is not your life.	Igbesi aye wọn kii ṣe igbesi aye rẹ.
I have another chance.	Mo ni anfani miiran.
Maybe a good thing.	Boya ohun ti o dara.
And well you can.	Ati daradara o le.
We should all be in bed.	O yẹ ki gbogbo wa wa ni ibusun.
It is possible.	O ṣee ṣe.
The end result is similar.	Ipari ipari jẹ iru.
That is everyone.	Gbogbo eniyan ni iyẹn.
But it's not the same.	Sugbon o ni ko kanna.
You have a way with words.	O ni ọna pẹlu awọn ọrọ.
This is not one.	Eyi kii ṣe ọkan.
Either way you missed it.	Ọna boya o padanu.
There any in the world.	Nibẹ eyikeyi ninu awọn aye.
He gave it to me.	O fi fun mi.
It is important to use the games correctly.	O ṣe pataki lati lo awọn ere ni ọna ti o tọ.
I should be angry.	Mo yẹ ki o binu.
I will not miss that moment.	Emi kii yoo padanu akoko naa.
He is dead.	O ti ku.
It is a love song.	Orin ife ni.
This guy tried to make everyone happy.	Arakunrin yii gbiyanju lati mu inu gbogbo eniyan dun.
Look at that in your face.	Iyẹn wo ni oju rẹ.
She is a married woman.	Obinrin ti o ti ni iyawo ni.
I missed not a minute.	Mo padanu kii ṣe iṣẹju kan.
Gotta be You.	O ni lati jẹ iwọ.
I do not see how you could have missed it.	Emi ko rii bi o ṣe le ti padanu rẹ.
She gave him everything he wanted.	O fun u ni ohun gbogbo ti o fẹ.
Many members agreed with the proposal.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti gba si imọran naa.
Can't help him here, you know.	Ko le ṣe iranlọwọ fun u nibi, o mọ.
What do you want to say.	Ohun ti o fẹ sọ.
That did not happen.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ.
Nothing makes any sense here.	Ko si ohun ti ṣe eyikeyi ori nibi.
I waited for a minute, wondering if it would stay down.	Mo duro fun iṣẹju kan, iyalẹnu boya yoo duro si isalẹ.
It just doesn't work.	O kan ko ṣiṣẹ.
It is about time of great trial.	O jẹ nipa akoko idanwo nla.
Without any program, women are learning to help.	Laisi eto eto eyikeyi, awọn obinrin n kọ ẹkọ lati ran.
It can be very hard.	O le gan lile.
They treat it the right way.	Wọn tọju rẹ ni ọna ti o tọ.
How did you learn so much?	Bawo ni o ṣe kọ ẹkọ pupọ?
He could not write at all.	Ko le kọ rara.
I think it is important to enjoy what you have.	Mo ro pe o jẹ pataki lati gbadun ohun ti o ni.
We have more than that to do.	A ni diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ lati ṣe.
One or two.	Ọkan tabi meji.
However, it seems they will not.	Sibẹsibẹ, o dabi pe wọn kii yoo.
He had never seen the before.	Oun ko tii ri awọn ṣaaju.
Wait for me, please.	Jọwọ, duro fun mi.
There are several reasons.	Awọn idi pupọ lo wa.
He lost his best friends.	O padanu awọn ọrẹ rẹ ti o dara julọ.
It's also good.	O tun dara.
Everyone was out and about.	Gbogbo eniyan wà jade ati nipa.
Understanding other people can hurt you.	Mọ oye awọn eniyan miiran le ṣe ipalara fun ọ.
We were hungry.	A wà ebi.
It is always completely true.	O nigbagbogbo jẹ otitọ patapata.
You have your own space.	O ni aaye tirẹ.
That is something.	Nkankan niyen.
Widely used in clothes, especially in winter.	Ti a lo pupọ ni awọn aṣọ, paapaa ni igba otutu.
There is nothing you can do here.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe nibi.
A pretty sweet situation.	A lẹwa dun ipo.
Not power, but power.	Kii ṣe agbara, ṣugbọn agbara.
I think it went well.	Mo ro pe o lọ daradara.
I need more money.	Mo nilo owo diẹ sii.
I do not really see that.	Emi ko rii iyẹn gaan.
All this is my opinion.	Gbogbo nkan yii ni ero mi.
I really want to see it.	Mo fẹ lati ri rẹ gaan.
She met her teacher yesterday.	O pade olukọ rẹ lana.
That did not surprise me.	Iyẹn ko ṣe ohun iyanu fun mi.
I need to contact one myself.	Mo nilo lati kan si ọkan ti ara mi.
It is important not to worry about this.	O ṣe pataki lati ma ṣe aniyan nipa eyi.
They started laughing.	Wọn bẹrẹ si rẹrin.
There was not a single plane in sight.	Ko si ọkọ ofurufu kan ti o wa ni oju.
I have seen on the roads.	Mo ti ri lori awọn ọna ni.
My car is in the store right now.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi wa ninu ile itaja ni bayi.
He went home.	O lọ si ile.
They also have more power.	Wọn tun ni agbara diẹ sii.
I get the same mistake.	Mo gba aṣiṣe kanna.
But that’s the way most men do.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ni ọna ti ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkunrin.
I can’t leave myself up there.	Emi ko le fi silẹ fun ara rẹ soke nibẹ.
She lost her sister and mother as a child.	O padanu arabinrin ati iya rẹ bi ọmọde.
I never forgot a face.	Emi ko gbagbe oju kan.
Move on.	Gbe lori.
This is important in many applications.	Eyi jẹ pataki ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun elo.
It is impossible to keep them.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati pa wọn mọ.
The situation forced him to leave.	Ipo naa fi agbara mu u lati lọ kuro.
I did some both.	Mo ṣe diẹ ninu awọn mejeeji.
He cut the tree at room temperature.	O ge igi ni otutu otutu otutu.
The doctors worried about his heart.	Awọn dokita ṣe aniyan nipa ọkan rẹ.
I also thought.	Mo tun ti ronu.
I like it very much.	Mo feran re pupo.
I asked him to do the same.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ lati ṣe kanna.
You have a new world here.	O ni aye tuntun nibi.
Did something happen?	Njẹ nkan kan ṣẹlẹ?
Let's see how good it is!	Jẹ ki a wo bi o ṣe dara to!
Tell them through you.	Sọ wọn nipasẹ rẹ.
I tell you, my heart is dead within me for a minute.	Mo sọ fun ọ, ọkan mi ti ku ninu mi fun iṣẹju kan.
It shook my head.	O mi ori .
This understanding makes the wife an instrument of her husband.	Oye yii jẹ ki iyawo jẹ ohun elo ọkọ rẹ.
I don't like that idea.	Emi ko fẹran ero yẹn.
If not, it's a bad book.	Ti ko ba ṣe bẹ, iwe buburu ni.
Maybe he really didn’t want to hurt her, physically.	Boya o gan ko fẹ lati ṣe ipalara fun u, ni ti ara.
He is on board.	O wa lori ọkọ.
Even as one of those who knew, but they did not learn.	Paapaa bi ọkan ninu awọn ti o mọ, ṣugbọn wọn ko kọ ẹkọ.
And they won.	Ati pe wọn gba.
We have tried it your way.	A ti gbiyanju o ọna rẹ.
No way.	Ko ṣee ṣe.
It is key up.	O ti wa ni bọtini soke.
They do not know their own names.	Wọn ko mọ orukọ ara wọn.
That is very important.	Nkan to se pataki niyen.
Future cars are powered by electricity.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ojo iwaju ni agbara nipasẹ ina.
I do not know what to say.	Emi ko mọ kini lati sọ.
Something that never came back from.	Ohun kan ti ko si bọ pada lati.
They always do great.	Wọn nigbagbogbo ṣe nla.
We put our heads together.	A fi ori wa papọ.
Both parents are always best for the child.	Awọn obi meji nigbagbogbo dara julọ fun ọmọde.
I probably shouldn’t.	Mo jasi ko yẹ.
The rest lasted several hours.	Isinmi naa gba awọn wakati pupọ.
They are, of course, that.	Wọn jẹ, dajudaju, iyẹn.
But times can.	Ṣugbọn awọn akoko le.
With so many students, the school is having a difficult time.	Pẹlu ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe, ile-iwe naa ni akoko ti o nira.
Be easy to work with.	Jẹ rọrun lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
He obviously had no intention of telling me the truth.	O han gbangba pe ko ni ero lati sọ otitọ fun mi.
I do not climb on the roof of my house.	Nko gun oke ile mi.
It should be.	O yẹ ki o jẹ.
But so what.	Sugbon ki ohun ti.
Does not matter.	Iyẹn ko ṣe pataki.
He did not ask for a reason.	Ko beere fun idi.
You must learn now.	O gbọdọ kọ ẹkọ ni bayi.
For a minute it stopped completely.	Fun iṣẹju kan o duro patapata.
I need both.	Mo nilo mejeeji.
I do not feel well at all.	Nko rilara rara rara.
You should be on the bus.	O yẹ ki o wa lori ọkọ akero.
You have.	O ni.
He wants you to go.	O fe ki o lọ.
More than anything, he doesn’t want you back.	Diẹ sii ju ohunkohun lọ, ko fẹ ki o pada.
Just read them.	Kan ka wọn.
It does not take long.	Ko gba to gun.
The sister is very nice.	Arabinrin naa dara pupọ.
So this will pay off.	Nitorina eyi yoo san fun.
They’re burning us out.	Wọn n sun wa jade.
It represents pretty much everything.	O duro lẹwa Elo ohun gbogbo.
And that is to stay that way.	Ati pe iyẹn ni lati duro ni ọna yẹn.
No tomorrow here.	Ko si ọla nibi.
This is why a good city.	Eyi jẹ idi ilu to dara.
That's it.	Bẹẹ niyẹn.
I want to go back.	Mo fe pada.
There is another person in the room.	Eniyan miiran wa ninu yara naa.
So you will not.	Nitorina iwọ kii yoo.
That decision is where most of this story begins.	Ipinnu yẹn ni ibiti pupọ ninu itan yii bẹrẹ.
I agree to more than you know.	Mo ti gba lati diẹ sii ju o mọ.
You think this is because your body has won.	O ti ro pe eyi jẹ nitori pe ara rẹ ti gba.
Tell you so.	Sọ fun ọ bẹ.
Thoughts dropped from it.	Awọn ero silẹ lati rẹ.
Apparently she had said something to him.	O han gbangba pe o ti sọ nkan kan fun u.
Okay, that doesn't help.	O dara, iyẹn kii ṣe iranlọwọ.
If you look back, there may be several reasons.	Ti o ba wo sẹhin, o le jẹ awọn idi pupọ.
More information on this method can be found here.	Awọn alaye diẹ sii lori ọna yii le ṣee ri nibi.
It will be very easy.	Yoo rọrun pupọ.
I love that.	Mo nifẹ ohun yẹn.
There is no city tour.	Ko si irinajo ilu.
You have to hope this summer.	O ni lati nireti ninu ooru yii.
However they continued.	Sibẹsibẹ wọn tẹsiwaju.
I figured out something.	Mo ro ero ohun jade.
I think that’s all for the moment.	Mo ro pe iyẹn ni gbogbo fun akoko naa.
It makes it very easy that way.	O jẹ ki o rọrun pupọ ni ọna yẹn.
No, not this room.	Rara, kii ṣe yara yii.
It took time to get to the city.	O gba akoko lati lo si ilu naa.
But my feet hurt.	Ṣugbọn ẹsẹ mi dun.
Not very good.	Ko dara pupọ.
It was a whole world.	O je kan gbogbo aye.
Maybe he was already here.	Boya o ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
Something is happening.	Nkankan n ṣẹlẹ.
It's not going anywhere.	Ko n jade ni ibi kankan.
Homes always keep their doors open.	Awọn ile nigbagbogbo jẹ ki ilẹkun wọn ṣii.
I will make it easy for you.	Emi yoo rọrun fun ọ.
There is nothing else in it.	Ko si ohun miiran ninu rẹ.
Or you have lost money.	Tabi ti o ti padanu owo.
This is where we become.	Eyi ni ibi ti a ti di.
Too much is not said.	Pupọ pupọ ni a ko sọ.
The accident happened a week ago.	Ijamba naa ṣẹlẹ ni ọsẹ kan sẹhin.
Not many friends.	Ko ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ.
The man is finished.	Ọkunrin naa ti pari.
They are both helpful and powerful.	Wọn jẹ mejeeji iranlọwọ ati agbara.
What a surprise it was.	Iyanu wo ni o jẹ.
And you have been wrong for a while.	Ati pe o ti ṣe aṣiṣe fun igba diẹ.
However, a dog is not a dog.	Sibẹsibẹ, aja ko jẹ aja.
He also tried to go to work.	O tun gbiyanju lati lọ si ibi iṣẹ.
On a mission.	Lori ise kan.
One would think they would start there but no.	Ọkan yoo ro pe wọn yoo bẹrẹ nibẹ ṣugbọn rara.
It will not matter anymore.	Kii yoo ṣe pataki mọ.
I will send this information to him.	Emi yoo fi alaye yii ranṣẹ si i.
No need to think long.	Ko nilo lati ronu gun.
Do a good job.	Ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara.
Until we know whether it is true or not.	Titi a fi mọ boya o jẹ otitọ tabi rara.
I did not plan it.	Emi ko gbero rẹ.
Even one life is too much.	Paapaa igbesi aye kan jẹ ọkan pupọ ju.
Too much here.	Pupọ ju nibi.
He will lose.	Oun yoo padanu.
On my head.	Lori mi ori.
We do not have a house.	A ko ni ile kan.
And that's exactly what you want.	Ati pe ohun ti o fẹ paapaa.
Bring me one.	Mu ọkan wa fun mi.
O je o.	O je o.
It should not be started early.	Ko yẹ ki o ti bẹrẹ mimu ni kutukutu.
Get over that, right now.	Gba lori iyẹn, ni bayi.
You should think about these types of services here.	O yẹ ki o ronu nipa awọn iru iṣẹ nibi.
Your friend did not come to you to test.	Ọrẹ rẹ ko wa si ọdọ rẹ lati ṣe idanwo.
I am not really your sister.	Emi kii ṣe arabinrin rẹ gaan.
But that is another matter.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ ọrọ miiran.
He was there for a while.	O wa nibẹ fun igba diẹ.
He is with her.	O wa pẹlu rẹ.
He does not speak anymore.	Ko sọrọ mọ.
Let's try this again.	Jẹ ká gbiyanju yi lẹẹkansi.
We have been in the same boat as you.	A ti wa ninu ọkọ oju omi kanna bi iwọ.
There is no such thing.	Ko si nkankan ti iru.
Things you will never understand.	Awọn nkan ti iwọ kii yoo loye.
You probably will.	O jasi yoo ni.
I will do anything for you.	Emi yoo ṣe ohunkohun fun ọ.
However in the end it gave him what he needed.	Sibẹsibẹ ni ipari o fun u ni ohun ti o nilo.
I want to have a good time with you.	Mo fe lati ni kan ti o dara akoko pẹlu ti o.
Write it up.	Kọ o soke.
It was my first.	O jẹ akọkọ mi.
I asked to sit down, and he agreed.	Mo beere lati joko, o si gba.
That's what it says.	Ohun ti o sọ niyẹn.
So it has no value.	Nitorina ko ni iye.
He was right all the time.	O ti tọ ni gbogbo igba.
Just to touch it.	O kan lati fi ọwọ kan rẹ.
But this has little to do with anything.	Ṣugbọn eyi ni diẹ lati ṣe pẹlu ohunkohun.
Children love their mother.	Awọn ọmọde fẹran iya wọn.
Some of them are your teachers at school.	Diẹ ninu wọn jẹ olukọ rẹ ni ile-iwe.
You have to go to sleep one way or another.	O ni lati lọ sun ni ọna kan.
I can't even explain.	Emi ko le paapaa ṣe alaye.
But it makes things easier.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ki awọn nkan rọrun.
This dish tastes better than last time.	Ounjẹ yii dun dara ju akoko ti o kẹhin lọ.
I turned to look at the bed next to me.	Mo yipada lati wo ibusun ti o wa nitosi mi.
Do what you do best.	Ṣe ohun ti o ṣe dara julọ.
It is very.	O jẹ pupọ.
But it can only give you a whole lot of love.	Ṣugbọn o le kan fun ọ ni gbogbo ifẹ pupọ.
It is my hometown.	Ilu ti a bi mi ni.
Read this article.	Ka nkan yii.
Try to do it together, they say.	Gbiyanju lati ṣe papọ, wọn sọ.
We had lunch at two.	A ti jẹ ounjẹ ọsan ni meji.
There is no way to tell for sure.	Ko si ọna lati sọ fun daju.
Take off your shoes.	Yọ bata rẹ kuro.
It does not exist.	Ko si tẹlẹ.
It lifts too high, too long.	O gbe ga ju, gun ju.
The man was bad news.	Ọkunrin naa jẹ iroyin buburu.
He said he knew that fact well.	O sọ pe o mọ otitọ yẹn daradara.
That could be any of us.	Iyẹn le jẹ eyikeyi ninu wa.
And how it is.	Ati bawo ni o.
He also wants to marry me again.	O tun fẹ lati fẹ mi lẹẹkansi.
So very good.	Nitorina dara pupọ.
We are nearby.	A wa nitosi.
I don't feel like it.	Emi ko lero bi o.
Try to attend more meetings.	Gbiyanju lati lọ si awọn ipade diẹ sii.
You know you have.	O mọ pe o ni.
So no, you can’t just get rid of it.	Nitorina rara, o ko le yọ kuro nikan.
Warm weather.	Oju ojo gbona.
This is not about that.	Eyi kii ṣe nipa iyẹn.
Start where one is.	Bẹrẹ ibi ti ọkan wa.
You can go fast.	O le yara lọ.
To get some rest.	Lati gba isinmi diẹ.
They will be filled soon enough by the others.	Wọn yoo kun ni kete to nipasẹ awọn miiran.
You probably don't like it.	O ṣee ṣe ko fẹran rẹ.
So, move on.	Nitorina, gbe lọ.
Children invite their friends to watch.	Awọn ọmọde pe awọn ọrẹ wọn lati wo.
I can't wait.	Emi ko duro.
Read up on it.	Ka soke lori o.
One thing is to be able to do.	Ohun kan ni lati wa ti o le ṣe.
I have never asked him to do anything he does not want.	Emi ko ti beere fun u lati ṣe ohunkohun ti ko fẹ.
Go out and now people notice it.	Lọ jade ati bayi eniyan ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
They have known him for their lives.	Wọn ti mọ ọ fun igbesi aye wọn.
Have to take that life.	Ni lati gba aye yẹn.
I should have a lot of time.	Mo yẹ ki o ni ọpọlọpọ akoko.
She was in love for the first time in her life.	O wa ninu ifẹ fun igba akọkọ ninu igbesi aye rẹ.
You can call everyone you know.	O le pe gbogbo eniyan ti o mọ.
I decided to try it myself.	Mo pinnu lati gbiyanju o funrararẹ.
Some out and others stay in.	Diẹ ninu awọn jade ati awọn miiran duro ni.
That didn’t change what had to happen and they both knew it.	Iyẹn ko yipada ohun ti o ni lati ṣẹlẹ ati pe awọn mejeeji mọ ọ.
He gives us all these things.	O fun wa ni gbogbo nkan wọnyi.
A little rest will make you feel better.	Isinmi diẹ yoo ṣe ọ dara.
He will not allow it.	Oun yoo ko gba laaye.
All teachers and students love this school.	Gbogbo awọn olukọ ati awọn ọmọ ile-iwe nifẹ ile-iwe yii.
But we are still around.	Sugbon a tun wa ni ayika.
It has never been so hot in recent times.	Ko ti gbona bẹ ni awọn akoko diẹ ṣaaju.
He did it.	O ṣe e.
Love begins at home.	Ifẹ bẹrẹ ni ile.
I know the way.	Mo mọ ọna naa.
I learned a lot from her.	Mo kọ ẹkọ pupọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
If you drive well, you will make a home.	Ti o ba wakọ daradara, iwọ yoo ṣe ile.
Our parents had little money but we were happy.	Awọn obi wa ko ni owo diẹ ṣugbọn inu wa dun.
Anyone who wants to can see through them.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ba fẹ le wo nipasẹ wọn.
It depends on your job.	O da lori iṣẹ rẹ.
The programs work as follows.	Awọn eto ṣiṣẹ bi wọnyi.
Three is bad, one is good.	Mẹta jẹ buburu, ọkan dara.
Throughout the story, no one can repay anyone.	Ninu gbogbo itan naa, ko si ẹnikan ti o le san ẹnikẹni pada.
Not many do it.	Ko ọpọlọpọ ṣe o.
You should try to get some rest.	O yẹ ki o gbiyanju lati gba isinmi diẹ.
Someone started working out.	Ẹnikan bẹrẹ ṣiṣẹ jade.
You have to be the world to make money.	O gbọdọ jẹ aye lati ṣe owo.
He is now dead.	O ti ku bayi.
Walk around the area.	Rin ni ayika agbegbe.
I don’t even want to see.	Emi ko paapaa fẹ lati rii.
The solar system is very demanding and is highly regarded.	Eto oorun jẹ ifẹ pupọ ati pe a ṣe akiyesi pupọ.
Do not.	Ṣe o ko ṣe.
Trying to put everything in one bag is great.	Idanwo lati fi ohun gbogbo sinu apo kan jẹ nla.
You should have some now.	O yẹ ki o ni diẹ ninu bayi.
But there is one thing that everyone must know.	Ṣugbọn ohun kan wa ti gbogbo eniyan gbọdọ mọ.
Some of you are afraid.	Diẹ ninu yin bẹru.
That makes all this pretty question so irrelevant.	Iyẹn jẹ ki gbogbo ibeere yii lẹwa pupọ ko ṣe pataki.
If you have any suggestions, go for it.	Ti o ba ni imọran, lọ fun.
I do for them.	Mo n ṣe fun wọn.
My system is pretty simple.	Mi eto jẹ lẹwa o rọrun.
Of course, it will also perform other functions.	Dajudaju, yoo tun ṣe awọn iṣẹ miiran.
They do not accept.	Wọn ko gba.
Turn back now.	Yipada sẹhin bayi.
He left us for a minute.	O fi wa silẹ fun iṣẹju kan.
Now, you need to tell him about your company.	Bayi, o nilo lati sọ fun u nipa ile-iṣẹ rẹ.
I just heard a lot.	Mo kan gbọ pupọ.
He is not easy to find.	Oun ko rọrun lati wa.
He has spoken forcefully since.	O ti sọrọ ni agbara lati igba naa.
You have some time.	O ni akoko diẹ.
This was your chance.	Eleyi je rẹ anfani.
Know the.	Mọ awọn.
You have to go to the doctor as a child.	O ni lati lọ si dokita bi ọmọde.
I love this game.	Mo nifẹ ere yii.
At least you told yourself that.	O kere ju o sọ fun ara rẹ pe.
I am sure you will love this.	O da mi loju pe iwọ yoo nifẹ eyi.
Let's go.	Jẹ ki a lọ.
I think that's gone.	Mo dabi iyẹn ti lọ.
He walked on water.	O rin lori omi.
He added that our capacity is too low.	O fi kun pe agbara wa kere ju.
Only a few things took me away right now.	Awọn nkan kekere nikan ni o mu mi kuro ni bayi.
This group works well.	Ẹgbẹ yii ṣiṣẹ daradara.
The same goes for you.	Kanna n lọ fun ọ.
Where you will use these will be in such situations.	Ibi ti o yoo lo awọn wọnyi yoo wa ni iru awọn ipo.
In the space of a week, it has changed a lot.	Ni aaye ti ọsẹ kan, o ti yipada pupọ.
The world is in big trouble.	Aye wa ninu wahala nla.
This new idea does not seem right to me.	Ero tuntun yii dabi pe ko dara si mi.
I really want to.	Mo fẹ gaan.
We do so.	A ṣe bẹ.
You should celebrate everything.	O yẹ ki o ṣe ayẹyẹ ohun gbogbo.
They want you to come back.	Wọn fẹ ki o pada wa.
But it does not seem that important.	Sugbon o ko dabi wipe pataki.
This will get you there.	Eyi yoo mu ọ wa nibẹ.
Recently I used this idea in a new house.	Laipẹ Mo lo imọran yii ni ile tuntun kan.
Your children will have to take their lives.	Awọn ọmọ rẹ yoo ni lati gba aye wọn.

His wife could not pay.	Iyawo re ko le san.
In my opinion, your opinion is wrong.	Si ọna ero mi, imọran rẹ jẹ aṣiṣe.

The day is over.	Ọjọ ti pari.
Maybe they have already given their status.	Boya wọn ti fun ni ipo wọn tẹlẹ.
I have to get it right.	Mo ni lati gba o tọ.
He would not have to do so.	Oun ko ba ti ni lati ṣe bẹ.
Now we must go.	Bayi a gbọdọ lọ.
This is not just about me.	Eyi kii ṣe nipa mi nikan.
That was another time, another time.	Iyẹn jẹ akoko miiran, akoko miiran.
There is not enough water here.	Ko si omi to nibi.
You will die.	Iwọ yoo ku.
Where do you work?	Nibo ni o ti ṣiṣẹ?
I don’t get it all.	Emi ko gba gbogbo rẹ.
I want to try to get rid of that before we go.	Mo fẹ gbiyanju lati sọ iyẹn kuro ṣaaju ki a to lọ.
There is a place you can not imagine.	Ibi wa nibẹ ti o ko le ronu.
See what they have given me.	Wo ohun ti wọn ti fun mi.
You have seen.	O ti ri.
Of course they know better.	Dajudaju wọn mọ dara julọ.
Not much has been said about that to date.	Ko tii sọ pupọ nipa iyẹn titi di oni.
Give yourself time.	Fun ara rẹ akoko.
Everything looks so much better.	Ohun gbogbo dabi pupọ dara julọ.
Some of them may go.	Diẹ ninu wọn le lọ.
He did not go out in public to see it.	Ko jade ni gbangba fun u lati ri.
But fear not, he is dead!	Ṣugbọn maṣe bẹru, o ti ku gaan!
We have to get through it.	A ni lati gba nipasẹ rẹ.
We would like to talk to you.	A yoo fẹ lati ba ọ sọrọ.
But they believe it is too high.	Ṣugbọn wọn gbagbọ pe o ga pupọ.
I really enjoy doing.	Mo gbadun pupọ lati ṣe.
I have known him many times in my work.	Mo ti mọ ọ ni ọpọlọpọ igba ninu iṣẹ mi.
He is very angry.	O binu gidigidi.
This tree indicates your age.	Igi yii da ọjọ ori rẹ han.
Do you want it now?	Ṣe o fẹ bayi?
I can’t be the only person here.	Emi ko le jẹ eniyan nikan nibi.
If you are like me, people do not like you.	Ti o ba dabi emi, eniyan ko fẹran rẹ.
Or a lot of the past.	Tabi pupọ ti o ti kọja.
They don’t just read a book.	Wọn ko kan ka iwe kan.
No way, baby.	Ko si ọna, ọmọ.
He made a point of not looking at his watch.	O ṣe aaye kan ti ko wo aago rẹ.
Good job!	Iṣẹ to dara!
And that's great.	Ati pe o dara julọ.
I hate it right.	Mo korira pe o tọ.
People know it’s a great gift.	Awọn eniyan mọ pe o jẹ ẹbun pupọ.
But there is.	Sugbon o wa.
It's me.	Emi ni.
There are few who can say that about it.	Diẹ ni o wa ti o le sọ iyẹn nipa rẹ.
It is important that we keep energy.	O ṣe pataki ki a tọju agbara.
If so, that's fine.	Ti o ba wa, o dara.
It may not be.	O le ma jẹ.
The night he was taken away.	Ni alẹ ti wọn gbe e lọ.
However, there is a big problem here.	Sibẹsibẹ, iṣoro nla kan wa nibi.
Know as the back of my hand.	Mọ bi ẹhin ọwọ mi.
I have to get better.	Mo ni lati dara.
Good for you.	O dara fun o.
Good things like this never happen to me.	Awọn nkan to dara bi eleyi ko ṣẹlẹ si mi.
But you wouldn’t have known that, working behind your desk.	Ṣugbọn iwọ kii yoo ti mọ iyẹn, ṣiṣẹ lẹhin tabili rẹ.
You are not able to say anything.	O ko ni anfani lati sọ ohunkohun.
I am convinced now.	Mo da mi loju bayi.
Two new areas appear.	Awọn agbegbe tuntun meji han.
How does one pronounce that name?	Bawo ni eniyan ṣe pe orukọ yẹn?
He hated it for it.	O si korira rẹ fun o.
It will be everywhere.	Yoo wa nibi gbogbo.
And of course he does not understand the art.	Ati pe dajudaju ko loye aworan.
Obviously you will get more than that.	O han gbangba pe iwọ yoo gba diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
I feel very hot on my lap as well.	Ara mi gbona gan lori itan mi pẹlu.
You must now get it out of it.	O gbọdọ bayi gba rẹ kuro ninu rẹ.
And you can always live here.	Ati pe o le nigbagbogbo gbe nibi.
You can not get out of town before nightfall.	O ko le jade kuro ni ilu ṣaaju ki alẹ.
I say you are not here, do not know where you are.	Mo sọ pe iwọ ko si nibi, ko mọ ibiti o wa.
I just do not use my phone much.	Mo kan ko lo foonu mi pupọ.
I turned to you.	Mo yipada si ọdọ rẹ.
It feels bad.	O ro pe ko dara.
Good job with that.	Iṣẹ to dara pẹlu eyi.
This is your run.	Eyi ni ṣiṣe rẹ.
We need these ideas because we are not finished.	A nilo awọn ero wọnyi nitori pe a ko ti pari.
No one will tell me anything.	Ko si ọkan yoo so fun mi ohunkohun.
I have also heard that you forgot to listen.	Mo tun ti gbọ pe o gbagbe lati gbọ.
Just stay in your room.	O kan duro ninu yara rẹ.
It doesn't taste good.	O dabi pe ko dun.
But we have to ask them.	Sugbon a ni lati beere wọn.
I think it will hit us an 'hard hit.	Mo ro pe o yoo lu wa ohun 'lu lile.
To get home.	Lati de ile.
They do not have them.	Wọn ko ni wọn.
I will leave the car for you.	Emi yoo fi ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ silẹ fun ọ.
It is obvious when you look.	O han gbangba nigbati o ba wo.
You need it going.	O nilo rẹ lọ.
Or they just don’t talk about it.	Tabi wọn ko sọrọ nipa rẹ nikan.
We really need the money.	A nilo owo naa gaan.
No one let her go.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o jẹ ki o lọ kuro.
At least that is not the way to solve the problem.	O kere kii ṣe ọna ti o sọ iṣoro naa.
It will be the same way back.	Yoo jẹ kanna ni ọna pada.
But sometimes.	Ṣugbọn awọn igba miiran.
Now my question.	Bayi ibeere mi.
He was called to the workplace, but not there.	A pe e ni ibi iṣẹ, ṣugbọn ko si nibẹ.
I love meeting people in person.	Mo nifẹ ipade eniyan ni eniyan.
I think you have put your past in the past.	Mo ro pe o ti fi rẹ ti o ti kọja ninu awọn ti o ti kọja.
He did not raise her up again.	O ko gbe e dide mọ.
She wonders what will happen to her life.	O ṣe iyalẹnu kini yoo ṣẹlẹ si igbesi aye rẹ.
Most people love to take the trip they took to see the new location.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan nifẹ lati rin irin-ajo ti wọn gba lati wo ipo tuntun.
Festive music is played.	Orin ayẹyẹ ti dun.
For some reason it did not happen.	Fun idi kan ti ko ṣẹlẹ.
They can beat us.	Wọn le lu wa.
He told me he was in his room.	O sọ fun mi pe o wa ninu yara rẹ.
Let me give you another one.	Jẹ ki n fun ọ ni ọkan miiran.
I don't want to hurt you.	Nko fe e binu.
Drink a glass of water.	Omi omi kan mu.
But he has made his bed.	Ṣugbọn o ti ṣe ibusun rẹ.
No, that is not true.	Rara, iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
He also refused to teach students for the same reason.	O tun kọ lati kọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe fun idi kanna.
He asked for rest.	O beere fun isinmi.
Her class and teacher love her.	Kilasi ati olukọ rẹ fẹran rẹ.
It can help you to have a better sleep.	O le ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ lati ni oorun oorun ti o dara julọ.
If we can not get it.	Ti a ko ba le gba a.
The company is owned by a large company.	Ile-iṣẹ naa ti gba nipasẹ ile-iṣẹ nla kan.
I think something is wrong.	Mo ro pe nkankan ti ko tọ.
I will find out who killed them.	Emi yoo wa ẹniti o pa wọn.
They have difficulty walking.	Wọn ni iṣoro lati rin.
It looks like a dead thing.	O dabi ohun ti o ku.
If that was what they thought, what would we do.	Ti o ba jẹ ohun ti wọn ro, kini a yoo ṣe.
I sit on it.	Mo joko lori rẹ.
They asked me the most about it.	Wọn beere lọwọ mi julọ nipa rẹ.
You must meet him there.	O gbọdọ pade rẹ nibẹ.
But, the word does not tell us this.	Ṣugbọn, ọrọ naa ko sọ fun wa eyi.
Do not sit either.	Maṣe joko boya.
It's not going at all.	Ko n lọ rara.
Not in your time.	Kii ṣe ni akoko tirẹ.
Do not dwell on the past.	Maṣe gbe lori ohun ti o ti kọja.
He can not move, he can not go, has to come.	Ko le gbe, ko le lọ, ni lati wa.
At first he did not seem to hear.	Ni akọkọ ko dabi ẹni pe o gbọ.
But first it will have to change.	Ṣugbọn akọkọ yoo ni lati yipada.
The journey takes no less than three hours.	Irin-ajo naa gba ko kere ju wakati mẹta lọ.
With that, he was a member of the family.	Pẹlu iyẹn, o jẹ ọmọ idile.
You should start with the first thought if possible.	O yẹ ki o bẹrẹ pẹlu ero akọkọ ti o ba ṣeeṣe.
It was not such.	O je ko iru.
And do not tell me you are not, because you are.	Ati pe maṣe sọ fun mi pe iwọ kii ṣe, nitori pe o wa.
They are all already.	Wọn ti wa ni gbogbo tẹlẹ.
This will give you space to use a little more.	Eyi yoo fun ọ ni aye lati lo diẹ diẹ sii.
He left that to me.	O fi iyẹn silẹ fun mi.
She left three children.	O fi awọn ọmọ mẹta silẹ.
This is not easy.	Eyi ko rọrun.
He says of course you can.	O sọ pe dajudaju o le.
He will do it if you can.	Oun yoo ṣe ti o ba le.
Not for anyone.	Kii ṣe fun ẹnikẹni.
Okay, this is good.	O dara, eyi dara dara.
I want to go into that room.	Mo fẹ lọ sinu yara yẹn.
And that doesn’t make sense.	Ati pe iyẹn ko ni oye.
They go through the water.	Wọn lọ nipasẹ omi.
I walked down the sides of the houses.	Mo rin si isalẹ awọn ẹgbẹ ti awọn ile.
It ended with me.	O pari pẹlu mi.
And those are my parents.	Ati awọn ti o ni awọn obi mi.
Don't talk to me like that.	Maṣe ba mi sọrọ bii iyẹn.
But problems persist.	Ṣugbọn awọn iṣoro tẹsiwaju.
That sounds like something you would do.	Iyẹn dabi nkan ti iwọ yoo ṣe.
All of which was in the past.	Gbogbo awọn ti o wà ninu awọn ti o ti kọja.
You just want something more.	O kan fẹ nkankan diẹ sii.
I heard they would move.	Mo ti gbọ ti won yoo gbe.
I call myself a woman.	Mo pe ara mi ni obinrin.
Not that hard.	Kii ṣe pe lile.
I will not stop you.	Emi ko ni mu ọ duro.
I was afraid of myself, and she was laughing.	Mo n bẹru ara mi, o si n rẹrin.
This is not about your thoughts.	Eyi kii ṣe nipa awọn ero rẹ.
None of them can.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn le.
The same day changed to two days a week.	Ọjọ kan naa yipada si ọjọ meji ni ọsẹ kan.
He never left me.	O ko fi mi silẹ rara.
In this way please.	Ni ọna yii jọwọ.
But it never paid off.	Sugbon ko san fun won rara.
See where you are.	Wo ibi ti o wa.
You said nothing.	O ko so nkankan.
Someone is looking at their backs.	Ẹnikan n wo ẹhin wọn.
That is the kind of person he is.	Iru eniyan ti o jẹ niyẹn.
I hope you enjoy our program today.	Mo nireti pe e gbadun eto wa loni.
After sitting down, she quickly ate.	Lẹhin ti o joko, o yara jẹun.
You should not stop learning.	O yẹ ki o ko da ẹkọ duro.
I want to feel bad.	Mo fe lati lero buburu.
You can swim across the river.	O le we kọja odo.
Most of the children have learned to read.	Pupọ ninu awọn ọmọde ti kọ ẹkọ lati ka.
I do not know your name.	Emi ko mọ orukọ rẹ.
That's why you give up the box.	Ti o ni idi ti o fi fun soke apoti.
Today we see that the idea is not over.	Loni a rii pe ero naa ko ti kọja.
This should be.	Eyi yẹ ki o jẹ.
With that, it is easy to look around.	Pẹlu iyẹn, o rọrun lati wo ni ayika.
More pictures are available on request.	Awọn aworan diẹ sii wa lori ibeere.
She and her new baby will have to be first.	Oun ati ọmọ tuntun rẹ yoo ni lati wa ni akọkọ.
He didn't think much of it until this moment.	Ko ronu pupọ nipa rẹ titi di iṣẹju yii.
We are all on your side.	Gbogbo wa ni ẹgbẹ rẹ.
What it was really like.	Ohun ti o wà gan bi.
He has done so much.	O ti ṣe bẹ pupọ.
On the edge, on the edge.	Lori eti, lori eti.
They don’t see you for what it is.	Wọn ko ri ọ fun ohun ti o jẹ.
He asked if he could have time for it today.	O beere boya o le ni akoko fun u loni.
So that, you say to yourself.	Nitorina iyẹn, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
He is happy to finish the job.	Inu rẹ dun lati pari iṣẹ naa.
I can't agree with him either.	Emi ko le ṣe adehun pẹlu rẹ pẹlu.
And if you do not understand something, speak up.	Ati pe ti o ko ba ni oye nkankan, sọ soke.
First we write many of them.	Ni akọkọ a kọ ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn.
My application is rejected.	Ohun elo mi ti kọ.
We tried a lot of them because some things felt wrong.	A gbiyanju ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn nitori pe awọn nkan kan ro pe ko tọ.
We can try again.	A le gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
I promise that.	Mo ṣe ileri pe.
The front of a restaurant is a thing.	Iwaju ti ounjẹ kan jẹ nkan kan.
It is a personal thing.	Ohun ti ara ẹni ni.
You can keep it if you want.	O le tọju rẹ ti o ba fẹ.
I have no idea about running a restaurant.	Emi ko ni oye nipa ṣiṣe ile ounjẹ kan.
Just get started.	O kan bẹrẹ.
The world is over.	Aye ti pari.
Not the girl.	Kii ṣe ọmọbirin naa.
If you do not like it very much.	Ti o ba jẹ pe ko fẹ rẹ pupọ.
Let's play them one at a time.	Jẹ ká mu wọn ọkan ni akoko kan.
They spent their first night there.	Wọn lo alẹ akọkọ wọn nibẹ.
He knew about the girls, he knew his brother had killed them.	O mọ nipa awọn ọmọbirin, mọ pe arakunrin rẹ ti pa wọn.
Both pictures include boys and girls.	Awọn aworan mejeeji pẹlu awọn ọmọkunrin ati awọn ọmọbirin.
He never tried, either.	Ko gbiyanju rara, boya.
He looked at me.	O wo mi.
This is not a difficult idea to understand.	Eyi kii ṣe imọran ti o nira lati ni oye.
This also happened.	Eyi tun ṣẹlẹ.
The game was really great.	Awọn ere wà gan nla.
You have lost your ear.	O ti padanu eti rẹ.
You can't break them up.	O ko le fọ wọn soke.
That is another thing to say.	Ohun miiran ti o sọ niyẹn.
They know their men.	Wọn mọ awọn ọkunrin wọn.
Children cannot go outside on vacation.	Awọn ọmọde ko le jade ni ita ni isinmi.
I think it is important that someone goes to yours.	Mo ro pe o ṣe pataki ki ẹnikan lọ si tirẹ.
I was afraid of how they would look at me.	Mo bẹru ti bi wọn yoo ṣe wo mi.
You can say it is not over.	O le sọ pe ko ti pari.
I have an idea.	Mo ni ero kan.
He will always try to have the final word.	Oun yoo gbiyanju nigbagbogbo lati ni ọrọ ikẹhin.
I will find a way to use your skills.	Emi yoo wa ọna lati lo awọn ọgbọn rẹ.
It is important that we rush outside to help.	O ṣe pataki ki a yara si ita lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
Everything else can continue to be as it is.	Gbogbo ohun miiran le tẹsiwaju lati jẹ bi o ti jẹ.
Plan to stay for a few days?	Gbero lati duro fun ọjọ diẹ bi?
But a small space.	Ṣugbọn aaye kekere kan.
I feel without anyone to feel it.	Emi ni rilara laisi ẹnikan lati lero rẹ.
Good location and it was a great deal.	Ipo to dara ati pe o jẹ adehun nla.
Fill your side with it if you can.	Kun ẹgbẹ rẹ pẹlu rẹ ti o ba le.
I have read this many times.	Mo ti ka eyi ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
More news at the bottom of the hour.	Awọn iroyin diẹ sii ni isalẹ ti wakati naa.
And it was as good as his words.	O si dara bi ọrọ rẹ.
When the men looked behind him, he continued.	Nigbati awọn ọkunrin naa wo ẹhin rẹ, o tẹsiwaju.
I think you should.	Mo ro pe o yẹ.
We must collect money.	A gbọdọ gba owo.
We decided on the river.	A pinnu lori odo.
Those in the body.	Awon ninu ara.
It's a wonderful opportunity.	Anfani iyanu ni.
Everyone has the same opportunity.	Gbogbo eniyan ni anfani kanna.
What a wonderful family.	Ohun ti a iyanu ebi.
And in some ways they are.	Ati ni diẹ ninu awọn ọna wọn jẹ.
But he knew who he was.	Ṣugbọn o mọ ẹniti o jẹ.
He died when he lost his boat.	O ku nigbati o padanu ọkọ oju omi rẹ.
You are the best thing that has ever happened to me.	Iwọ ni ohun ti o dara julọ ti o ti ṣẹlẹ si mi.
So, where did you come from?	Nitorina, nibo ni o ti wa?
For sure.	O daju.
He could not lift it.	Ko le gbe e soke.
You lose to a person who has a very good year.	O padanu si eniyan kan ti o ni ọdun ti o dara julọ.
Everyone has to talk to me.	Gbogbo eniyan ni lati ba mi sọrọ.
I hate that.	Mo korira iyẹn.
That money is hard to come by.	Owo yẹn nira lati wa.
Do not expect them to understand.	Maṣe nireti pe wọn yoo loye.
This is not one of those situations.	Eyi kii ṣe ọkan ninu awọn ipo yẹn.
I really look forward to this new world.	Mo ti nireti gaan si aye tuntun yii.
It is inside.	Ita ni inu.
Now everything is back.	Bayi ohun gbogbo ti pada.
This is a beautiful one.	Eyi ni ọkan lẹwa.
The story is always the same.	Itan naa nigbagbogbo jẹ kanna.
This works really well.	Eleyi ṣiṣẹ gan daradara.
Here they apply both.	Nibi wọn kan awọn mejeeji.
Now, so much so.	Bayi, pupọ bẹ.
He stays home all day.	O duro ni ile ni gbogbo ọjọ.
And put the test.	Ki o si fi idanwo.
It is impossible to wait.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati duro.
They should stay away, like everyone else.	Wọn yẹ ki o duro kuro, bi gbogbo eniyan miiran.
Making yourself happy.	Ṣiṣe ara rẹ dun.
Ma a fe.	Ma a fe.
It happens to some people.	O ṣẹlẹ si diẹ ninu awọn eniyan.
I think he wanted me to help him something from someone.	Mo ro pe o fe mi lati ran rẹ nkankan lati ẹnikan.
He did not know that they had changed their name.	Ko mọ pe wọn yi orukọ pada.
For good news.	Fun iroyin ti o dara.
To have them for yourself.	Lati ni wọn fun ara rẹ.
That this way is the only way we can know.	Wipe ọna yii nikan ni ọna ti a le mọ.
Much of that.	Pupọ ti iyẹn.
It’s beautiful and perfect.	O lẹwa ati pe.
Some things to do.	Diẹ ninu awọn nkan lati ṣe.
Sorry if this is in the wrong world.	Ma binu ti eyi ba wa ni aye ti ko tọ.
I entered the city well.	Mo wọ ilu daradara.
Good now.	O dara bayi.
Surprisingly, this is both good and bad news.	Iyalẹnu, eyi jẹ mejeeji ti o dara ati awọn iroyin buburu.
Not for nothing.	Kii ṣe fun ohunkohun.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ko si ohun ti ko tọ si pẹlu ti o.
You can laugh well.	O le rẹrin daradara.
Nothing serious happened.	Ko si ohun to ṣe pataki ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It's very demanding.	O n beere pupọ.
It is impossible to determine your heart.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati pinnu ọkan rẹ.
I say as long as you are.	Mo sọ pe o gun bi o ṣe wa.
Here remember.	Nibi ranti.
If you work for him, more power for him.	Ti o ba ṣiṣẹ fun u, agbara diẹ sii fun u.
They will not know our names.	Wọn kii yoo mọ awọn orukọ wa.
Winter has arrived early.	Igba otutu ti de ni kutukutu.
There are many companies that do.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile-iṣẹ wa ti o ṣe.
You can be better.	O le dara julọ.
He will not say a word.	Oun ko ni sọ ọrọ kan.
But this is what it does.	Ṣugbọn eyi ni ohun ti o ṣe.
When you need your help, give.	Nigbati o ba nilo iranlọwọ rẹ, fun ni.
It is yours for life.	O jẹ tirẹ fun igbesi aye.
For a year or two.	Fun ọdun kan tabi meji.
He will have his own work.	Oun yoo ni iṣẹ tirẹ.
That is very important.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki pupọ julọ.
They will not leave the house.	Wọn kii yoo lọ kuro ni ile.
You can not.	O le ko.
Our help.	Iranlọwọ wa.
They are a great team and they really bring the game to us.	Wọn jẹ ẹgbẹ nla kan ati pe wọn mu ere naa gaan si wa.
But this time, it worked for your benefit.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yii, o ṣiṣẹ fun anfani rẹ.
Remember that name, say that name.	Ranti orukọ yẹn, sọ orukọ yẹn.
That's easy.	Iyẹn rọrun.
Remember them, remember them well !.	Ranti wọn, ranti wọn daradara!.
Even a little taller than you.	Paapaa diẹ ga ju iwọ lọ.
How they are right.	Bawo ni wọn ṣe tọ.
It is not difficult at all about this.	Oun ko nira rara nipa iru nkan yii.
But you have to believe.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati gbagbọ.
You know that, especially.	O mọ iyẹn, paapaa.
The cat understood very well.	Ologbo naa loye pupọ.
It’s not a machine, not the least.	Kii ṣe ẹrọ, kii ṣe ni o kere julọ.
Everyone deserves to be here.	Gbogbo eniyan yẹ lati wa nibi.
That is a fact of life.	Otitọ ọrọ naa ni.
Anyone who wants it will have to try really hard.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ba fẹ o yoo ni lati gbiyanju gaan.
Get on your own, you probably think.	Gba lori ara rẹ, o ṣee ṣe ki o ronu.
But that will last a little longer.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn yoo ṣiṣe ni igba diẹ to gun.
However have seen some kind of work.	Sibẹsibẹ ti ri iru iṣẹ kan.
We want to do this for a while.	A fẹ ṣe eyi fun igba diẹ.
It was a long wait.	O je kan gun duro.
But it can't.	Sugbon ko le.
I had to start telling the whole truth.	Mo ni lati bẹrẹ sọ gbogbo otitọ.
All good in the end.	Gbogbo dara ni ipari.
This year it will be much smaller.	Ni ọdun yii yoo kere pupọ.
This method is likely to be revised soon.	O ṣeeṣe ki a tun ọna yii ṣe laipẹ.
And we did.	Ati pe a ṣe.
Is there anyone who can, please?	Ṣe ẹnikẹni wa ti o le, jọwọ?
As if nothing had changed.	Bi ohunkohun ko yipada.
I told him to stop.	Mo sọ fun u pe ki o duro.
I want my own children to be with me.	Mo fẹ awọn ọmọ ti ara mi lati wa pẹlu mi.
How many are there ?.	Melo ni o wa nibẹ?.
This is where we grow up.	Ibi ti a dagba ni.
Get what you ask for.	Gba ohun ti o beere fun.
You like this.	O fẹ eyi.
Stories of the future.	Awọn itan ti ojo iwaju.
Find out for yourself.	Wa jade fun ara rẹ.
I don't want to tell you.	Emi ko fẹ sọ fun ọ.
The teacher may have missed out.	O ṣee ṣe olukọ padanu.
We decided to get married at home.	A pinnu lati ṣe igbeyawo ni ile.
Do not write anything at all.	Maṣe kọ ohunkohun rara.
It has to be true.	O ni lati jẹ otitọ.
But you have to take me out.	Sugbon o ni lati mu mi jade.
It was great to see that, great to see the fire.	O jẹ nla lati rii iyẹn, nla lati ri ina.
I have not been able to open my box.	Mi o ti le ṣii apoti mi.
Cannot read or write.	Ko le ka tabi kọ.
Make sure your child is watching.	Rii daju pe ọmọ rẹ n wo.
We went to a costume party.	A ti lọ si ayẹyẹ aṣọ kan.
I have it.	Mo ti i.
However, doing this properly is not easy.	Sibẹsibẹ, ṣiṣe eyi daradara ko rọrun.
His mother was right.	Iya rẹ ti tọ.
All this is in your eyes.	Gbogbo eyi wa ni oju rẹ.

We look forward to returning tomorrow.	A n reti fun pada ni ọla.
I am not sure at this point.	Emi ko da mi loju ni aaye yii.
I can insert.	Mo le fi sii.
It was a good run for us.	O jẹ ṣiṣe ti o dara fun wa.
I'll see you next week.	Emi yoo ri e ni ọsẹ to nbọ.
This includes the area.	Eyi wa pẹlu agbegbe naa.
You cannot hear where one word ends and another begins.	O ko le gbọ ibi ti ọrọ kan pari ati pe miiran bẹrẹ.
Listen to good music.	Gbọ orin to dara.
Local time.	Akoko agbegbe.
It's a good word.	O jẹ ọrọ ti o dara.
My first.	Awọn akọkọ mi.
Get rid of yourself.	Mọ ara rẹ kuro.
They had already gone for the train station.	Wọn ti lọ tẹlẹ fun ibudo ọkọ oju irin.
Now he is gone.	Bayi o ti lọ sẹhin.
It makes you believe in a home and forever.	O mu ki o gbagbọ ni ile kan ati lailai.
Be of the streets and the streets.	Jẹ ti awọn ita ati ni ita.
If you like them, let me know why.	Ti o ba fẹran wọn, jẹ ki mi mọ idi.
Be that way.	Ti wa ni ọna yẹn.
He missed it.	O padanu rẹ.
We pay a small fee.	A san owo kekere kan.
Bring it here, and soon.	Mu u wa nibi, ati laipẹ.
There are two men who can read and understand.	Nibẹ ni awọn ọkunrin meji ti le ka ati loye.
This is not a new concept.	Eyi kii ṣe imọran tuntun.
I can't grow hair on my head.	Emi ko le dagba irun si ori mi.
You'll have to wait.	O ni lati duro.
The little boy walked home alone.	Ọmọkunrin kekere naa rin ile nikan.
The whole world is worth a world.	Gbogbo aye ni tọ a aye.
I will give you information.	Emi yoo fun ọ ni alaye.
Much has gone since then.	Elo ti lọ lati igba naa.
Okay, that may not be true.	O dara, iyẹn ko le jẹ otitọ.
I want to stand out.	Mo fe lati duro jade.
But you have to leave.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati lọ kuro.
Sorry to have to eat you.	Ma binu pe o ni lati jẹ iwọ.
My friends are worried.	Awọn ọrẹ mi ṣe aniyan.
You will learn a lot about yourself by doing so.	Iwọ yoo kọ ẹkọ pupọ nipa ararẹ nipa ṣiṣe bẹ.
Words will not come to mind.	Awọn ọrọ kii yoo wa si ori.
I can’t talk about it, ever.	Emi ko le sọrọ nipa rẹ, lailai.
Sit down with us, and tell us what you know.	Joko pẹlu wa, ki o si sọ ohun ti o mọ fun wa.
Pull out my seat.	Fa ijoko mi jade.
But nothing stands out.	Sugbon ti ohunkohun ko duro jade.
Your understanding of everything.	Rẹ oye ti ohun gbogbo.
No one left the house.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o lọ kuro ni ile naa.
And my sister.	Ati arabinrin mi.
Can't make this thing up.	Ko le ṣe nkan yii soke.
They are all on their feet, just two.	Gbogbo wọn wa ni ẹsẹ wọn, awọn meji ni o kan.
He wants me not him.	O fẹ mi kii ṣe oun.
She raised her son well.	O gbe ọmọ rẹ daradara.
Wait, make that even possible.	Duro, ṣe iyẹn paapaa ṣee ṣe.
There are many things.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun kan wa.
We only need to bring our personal belongings and food.	A nilo lati mu awọn nkan ti ara ẹni ati ounjẹ wa nikan.
He also did wonders with them.	O tun ṣe iṣẹ iyanu pẹlu wọn.
Here’s what you love about your new project.	Eyi ni ohun ti o nifẹ nipa iṣẹ tuntun rẹ.
They are pretty much forced out.	Wọn ti wa ni lẹwa Elo a fi agbara mu jade.
We will have to leave something else in their place.	A yoo ni lati fi nkan miiran silẹ ni aaye wọn.
, we had.	, ati.
Do just that.	Ṣe o kan.
But let's not talk about it.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki a ma sọrọ nipa rẹ.
A period of severe weather is expected.	Akoko ti oju ojo lile ni a nireti.
He worried that it was something else.	O ṣe aniyan pe nkan miiran ni.
Everything is thought.	Ohun gbogbo ni ero.
We can have that.	A le ni iyẹn.
But we do not get to the future.	Ṣugbọn a ko gba si akoko iwaju.
So allow yourself.	Nitorina gba ara rẹ laaye.
I will never miss one on yours.	Emi kii yoo padanu ọkan lori tirẹ.
At least not for your own sake.	O kere kii ṣe fun idi rẹ nikan.
He carried it out.	O gbe e jade.
At least not on your own.	O kere kii ṣe lori ara rẹ.
I will walk in.	Emi yoo rin sinu.
I really want people to love our music.	Mo fẹ ki awọn eniyan fẹran orin wa gaan.
To do that we need local money that will stay in the area.	Lati ṣe pe a nilo owo agbegbe ti yoo duro ni agbegbe.
I don’t hate much of these.	Emi ko korira pupo ti awọn wọnyi.
But it does not matter.	Sugbon ko ṣe pataki.
That always lets you go.	Iyẹn nigbagbogbo jẹ ki o lọ.
I want to tell myself that can not happen.	Mo fẹ sọ fun ara mi pe ko le ṣẹlẹ.
I don’t think they know what to do with me.	Emi ko ro pe wọn mọ kini lati ṣe pẹlu mi.
It appears only to be one.	O han nikan lati jẹ ọkan.
I saw it two weeks ago.	Mo ti rii ni ọsẹ meji sẹhin.
Better to feel something than anything.	Dara lati lero nkankan ju ohunkohun.
Not everyone likes dogs.	Ko gbogbo eniyan fẹran aja.
So you know it's good.	Nitorina o mọ pe o dara.
That was a few years ago.	Iyẹn jẹ ọdun diẹ sẹhin.
That's good.	O dara yẹn.
It's amazing!	O jẹ iyanu!
Help is great.	Iranlọwọ jẹ nla.
Change well.	Yipada daradara.
His eyes never returned to us.	Oju rẹ ko gbe pada si wa.
Not sure if it is worth it.	Ko daju boya o tọ si.
It does not matter which.	Ko ṣe pataki eyi ti.
So what do you think?	Nitorina kini o ro?
I will buy from them again.	Emi yoo tun ra lọwọ wọn lẹẹkansi.
We are into it.	A wa sinu rẹ.
It's all music.	Gbogbo orin ni.
It doesn't say much of anything.	O ko so Elo ti ohunkohun.
You love it, you know.	O nifẹ rẹ, o mọ.
At first it seemed like a good idea.	Ni akọkọ ti o dabi imọran to dara.
Okay, great deal.	O dara, adehun nla.
He had a lot of his father in it.	O ni pupọ ti baba rẹ ninu rẹ.
That is something you do not want to happen to you.	Iyẹn jẹ nkan ti o ko fẹ ṣẹlẹ fun ọ.
You want people to want to help you.	O fẹ ki awọn eniyan fẹ lati ran ọ lọwọ.
You never miss a thing.	O ko padanu rara.
He is known for his honesty.	O mọ fun otitọ rẹ.
With a lot of energy.	Pẹlu agbara pupọ.
This has been my whole life.	Eyi ni gbogbo igbesi aye mi.
I mean, he hit me hard.	Mo tumọ si, o lu mi ni lile.
He is all around.	O wa ni ayika.
Who wrote that song?	Tani o kọ orin yẹn?
I invite you to wait for lunch.	Mo pe o lati duro fun ounjẹ ọsan.
They are not dead.	Wọn ko ti ku.
For more.	Fun diẹ.
Do it any way you want.	Ṣe o ni eyikeyi ọna ti o fẹ.
At first, this idea was not good.	Ni akọkọ, imọran yii ko dara.
And just, you know.	Ati pe o kan, o mọ.
I think we've got enough men up there.	Mo ro pe a ti ni to ọkunrin soke nibẹ.
To kill something.	Lati pa nkankan.
They feel bad about it.	Wọn lero buburu nipa rẹ.
To be honest, only one person noticed me.	Lati sọ otitọ, eniyan kan nikan ni o ṣe akiyesi mi.
She is watching her children.	O n wo awọn ọmọ rẹ.
It has been a very helpful book.	O ti jẹ iwe iranlọwọ gaan.
Some of these are very good.	Diẹ ninu awọn wọnyi dara pupọ.
We love it so much, so much.	A nifẹ rẹ bẹ, pupọ pupọ.
You also have to call.	O tun ni lati pe.
We can’t even deal with that right now.	A ko le paapaa pẹlu eyi ni bayi.
We will wait.	A yoo duro.
He freed himself.	O da ara rẹ silẹ.
Many parents ask their children to read books.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn obi beere awọn ọmọ wọn lati ka awọn iwe.
You can contact them through.	O le kan si wọn nipasẹ.
That would be a big deal.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ adehun nla nla kan.

Two other cars are there now.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ meji miiran wa nibẹ ni bayi.
Lift up, pass, look to get.	Gbe soke, kọja, wo lati gba.
This thing will kill you.	Nkan yi yoo pa ọ.
How can one be sure of that?	Bawo ni eniyan ṣe le ni idaniloju iyẹn?
This is the time, however.	Eyi jẹ ni akoko, sibẹsibẹ.
This, however, is not entirely true.	Eyi, sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe otitọ patapata.
I can only speak for myself.	Mo le sọ fun ara mi nikan.
Only three men.	Awọn ọkunrin mẹta nikan.

You will be better off if you ask a question.	Iwọ yoo dara julọ ti o ba beere ibeere kan.
Let me ask you again.	Jẹ ki n beere lọwọ rẹ lẹẹkansi.
If you do not let yourself be less, the game is over.	Ti o ko ba jẹ ki ara rẹ kere si, ere ti pari.
This house is the first house for garden furniture.	Ile yii jẹ ile akọkọ fun ohun elo ọgba.
What to call is not decided.	Ohun ti yoo pe ni a ko ti pinnu.
It always means they are trying to sell me something.	Nigbagbogbo o tumọ si pe wọn n gbiyanju lati ta nkan fun mi.
Not even for you.	Ko paapaa fun o.
It is not the first time you have seen someone die.	Kii ṣe igba akọkọ ti o ri ẹnikan ti o ku.
In the end maybe it worked for the better.	Ni ipari boya o ti ṣiṣẹ fun ohun ti o dara julọ.
He will be back here tomorrow.	Oun yoo pada wa nibi ni ọla.
By the way, you have many kinds of stories to tell.	Nipa ọna, o ni ọpọlọpọ iru awọn itan lati sọ.
Who did this?	Tani o ṣe eyi?
Can't remember anymore.	Ko le ranti mọ.
You read into it and see what you think.	O ka sinu rẹ ati ki o wo ohun ti o ro.
This is very important to me.	Eyi jẹ pataki pupọ fun mi.
Jade, jade, jade.	Jade, jade, jade.
But try it on.	Sugbon gbiyanju o lori.
Maybe he'll see them soon.	Boya oun yoo rii wọn laipẹ.
You got me nice.	O gba mi dara.
But not for food.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe fun ounjẹ.
Okay, I'm glad you asked.	O dara, inu mi dun pe o beere.
She will be the bride.	Iyawo ni yoo jẹ.
When they want a break.	Nigbati wọn fẹ isinmi.
I see a world as a garden.	Mo ri aye kan bi ọgba.
Can we stay in the supermarket on the way back?	Njẹ a le duro ni ile itaja nla ni ọna ti o pada?
Just down the road.	O kan si isalẹ ni opopona.
They can not, will not be able to help him.	Wọn ko le, kii yoo ni anfani lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
He will not tell you.	Oun ko ni sọ fun ọ.
It carries fire, sound, and people.	O gbe ina, ohun, ati eniyan.
That will be enough for both.	Iyẹn yoo ni lati to fun awọn mejeeji.
Have you lost your food?	Njẹ o ti padanu ounjẹ rẹ bi?
Across the street.	Kọja awọn ita.
When we have more, it is not enough.	Nigba ti a ba ni diẹ sii, ko to.
I am very happy.	Inu mi dun gaan.
They do not want them.	Wọn ko fẹ wọn.
Warm weather does not get along with it.	Oju ojo gbona ko gba pẹlu rẹ.
But you have to stay here.	Sugbon o ni lati duro nibi.
The cause of the fire is unknown.	A ko mọ idi ti ina naa.
It is nearby there.	O wa nitosi nibẹ.
It can work.	O le ṣiṣẹ.
Of course I did not intend to cause so much trouble.	Dajudaju Emi ko pinnu lati fa wahala pupọ bẹ.
He also has things to do.	Oun naa ni awọn nkan lati ṣe.
I do not like this.	Emi ko fẹran eyi.
It is not a bad thing.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ buburu.
Something works, so you don't have to.	Nkan ti o ṣiṣẹ, nitorina o ko ni lati.
And it was a game for us.	Ati pe o jẹ ere fun wa.
Any errors you may find are solely mine.	Eyikeyi awọn aṣiṣe ti o le rii jẹ ti emi nikan.
I'll do that in the morning.	Emi yoo ṣe iyẹn ni owurọ.
The sister is very nice.	Arabinrin naa dara pupọ.
No one came out.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o jade.
He can’t, as a teenager, let things go.	Ko le, bi awọn ọdọ, jẹ ki awọn nkan lọ.
I thought a little.	Mo ro kekere kan silẹ.
There are so many mothers.	Pupọ awọn iya ni.
I should not force myself into your life.	Emi ko yẹ ki o fi agbara mu ara mi sinu igbesi aye rẹ.
That will change.	Iyẹn yoo yipada.
In many ways they do.	Ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna wọn ṣe.
I used to get the phone.	Mo lo lati gba foonu naa.
That's for sure.	Iyẹn daju.
More than that you do not have to make any plans.	Diẹ sii ju kii ṣe o ko ni lati ṣe eto eyikeyi.
It belongs to our group.	O jẹ ti ẹgbẹ wa.
We will be in trouble soon.	A yoo wa ninu wahala laipẹ.
One of the fastest growing areas.	Ọkan ninu awọn agbegbe ti o yara dagba.

I feel good.	Mo lero ti o dara.
I do not know where.	Emi ko mọ ibiti.
You believe so much.	O ṣe gbagbọ pupọ.
It worked long together.	O ṣiṣẹ pẹ papọ.
We will tell our mother in a few more minutes.	A yoo sọ fun iya wa ni iṣẹju diẹ miiran.
Or you have a lot of rain.	Tabi o ni ọpọlọpọ ojo.
Read them before they leave.	Ka wọn ṣaaju ki wọn to lọ.

It's a great place.	Ibi nla ni.
I should not leave you.	Emi ko yẹ ki o fi ọ silẹ.
They have not moved in all day.	Wọn ko tii gbe ni gbogbo ọjọ.
From here there is no other way.	Lati ibi ko si ọna miiran.
A few very important things.	Awọn nkan pataki pupọ diẹ.
But this has never been the case in my life.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko ti ri bẹ ninu igbesi aye mi.
The door is open.	Ilẹkun ṣi.
The sister did not know.	Arabinrin naa ko mọ.
Bring a friend if both parents are not present.	Mu ọrẹ wa ti awọn obi mejeeji ko ba wa.
Dinner at home because, as everyone knows, children have to eat.	Ounjẹ alẹ ni ile nitori, bi gbogbo eniyan ṣe mọ, awọn ọmọde ni lati jẹun.
You can read the entire book.	O le ka gbogbo iwe.
And he worried.	O si ṣe aniyan.
There is no easy way, do you?	Ko si ọna ti o rọrun, ṣe?
He thought it was impossible.	O ro pe ko ṣee ṣe.
But it will not happen.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
I learned a lot because of that.	Mo kọ ẹkọ pupọ nitori iyẹn.
And maybe we love interest as well.	Ati boya a ife anfani bi daradara.
The French told them about us.	Faranse sọ fun wọn nipa wa.
Okay, just come here.	O dara, o kan wa nibi.
They should talk.	Wọn yẹ ki o sọrọ.
Find out really well.	Wa jade gan daradara.

And sometimes it is great and sometimes it is not great.	Ati nigba miiran o jẹ nla ati nigba miiran kii ṣe nla.

It has entered your heart.	Ti wọ inu ọkan rẹ lọ.

The main reason is explained.	A ṣe alaye idi pataki.
At this time we can not.	Ni akoko yii a ko le.
Is this a bad guy?	Ṣe eyi jẹ eniyan buburu?
I think it is important.	Mo ro pe o ṣe pataki.
He walked with vigor around the big room.	O rin pẹlu agbara ni ayika yara nla.
It is not the right time.	Kii ṣe akoko ti o tọ.
I hope you have a great day.	Mo nireti pe o ni ọjọ nla kan.
Three feet is three feet.	Ẹsẹ mẹta jẹ ẹsẹ mẹta.
Bad.	Buburu.
The decision as to whether to seek or receive help is yours.	Ipinnu boya lati wa tabi gba iranlọwọ jẹ tirẹ.
It was not so much in itself.	O je ko bẹ Elo ninu ara rẹ.
They were great moments.	Wọn jẹ awọn akoko nla.
He held his hand open.	O di ọwọ rẹ ṣii.
Just you and your mother.	O kan ati iya rẹ.
Another day or two, maybe.	Ọjọ miiran tabi meji, boya.
He cannot meet his father now.	Ko le pade baba rẹ bayi.
Something came up, but we did not know what.	Nkankan wa soke, ṣugbọn a ko mọ kini.
No one knows why it happened.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ idi ti o fi ṣẹlẹ.
Why not wash your car?	Kilode ti o ko fo ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ?
Or so and higher.	Tabi bẹ ati ga julọ.
Not true.	Kii ṣe otitọ.
I hate pictures.	Mo korira awọn aworan.
I owe my life to you.	Mo je aye mi si o.
He walks with determination.	O rin pẹlu ipinnu.
That amount is correct.	Iye yẹn tọ.
So, where are we going from here?	Nitorina, nibo ni a yoo lọ lati ibi?
That you need it more.	Wipe o nilo rẹ diẹ sii.
I can tell the way they do.	Mo le sọ ọna ti wọn ṣe.
Sounds simple enough.	Dun rọrun to.
It is not easy to do.	Ko rọrun lati ṣe.
I started feeling it.	Mo bẹrẹ si ni rilara rẹ.
I would say we need to play football better.	Emi yoo sọ pe a nilo lati ṣiṣe bọọlu dara julọ.
Enjoy your lunch.	Gbadun ounjẹ ọsan rẹ.

We are raising some people.	A n gbe awọn eniyan kan soke.
He went back to bed.	O pada si ibusun.
I think that makes sense.	Mo ro pe iyẹn jẹ oye.
He had no reason to kill her.	Ko ni idi lati pa a.
I do not know why.	Emi ko mọ idi rẹ rara.
I have never seen anything like it.	Emi ko tii ri iru eyi ri.

This is now for us.	Eyi jẹ bayi fun wa.
They are back from the front.	Wọn ti pada lati iwaju.
There are many museums in the area.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile itan wa ni agbegbe naa.
The accident happened on the road.	Ijamba naa ṣẹlẹ ni opopona.
I always thought that was good.	Mo nigbagbogbo ro pe iyẹn dara dara.

I watched the game last night.	Mo wo ere naa ni alẹ ana.

Of course, they were wrong.	Dajudaju, wọn ṣe aṣiṣe.
They can go.	Wọn le lọ.
There is now a question about it.	Ibeere kan wa bayi nipa rẹ.
Not so.	Ko ri bẹ.
Is that understandable.	Ṣe iyẹn jẹ oye.
That did not work, of course.	Iyẹn ko ṣiṣẹ, dajudaju.
Of course, they have a lot of food.	Dajudaju, wọn ni ounjẹ pupọ.
Make no mistake, this is our time.	Maṣe ṣe aṣiṣe, eyi ni akoko wa.
At this point, it is too early to say.	Ni aaye yii, o ti wa ni kutukutu lati sọ.
No final decision was made.	A ko ṣe ipinnu ikẹhin.
This is such a good book.	Eleyi jẹ iru kan ti o dara iwe.
But the truth is that there are other ways to do that.	Ṣugbọn otitọ ni pe awọn ọna miiran wa lati ṣe iyẹn.
But nothing.	Ṣugbọn ko si nkankan.
Come to us.	Wa si wa.
Most passengers on the plane have not been on board.	Pupọ awọn ero inu ọkọ ofurufu ko ti gun lori ọkọ ofurufu.
This is what we do at home.	Eyi ni ohun ti a ṣe ni ile.
The sister is.	Arabinrin naa jẹ.

Anything you can think of.	Ohunkohun ti o le ro.

So you get this.	Nitorina o gba eyi.
I did my best to forget it, too.	Mo ti ṣe ohun ti o dara ju lati gbagbe rẹ, ju.
Do not be afraid of this girl out of her mind.	Maṣe bẹru ọmọbirin yii kuro ninu ọgbọn rẹ.
I look at it again.	Mo tun wo o.
And he told me they had to.	O si so fun mi pe won ni lati.
That makes it more interesting.	Ti o mu ki o diẹ awon.
You want me to stop that.	O fẹ ki n da si iyẹn.
About his father.	Nipa baba rẹ.
It is also a love story.	O tun jẹ itan ifẹ.
I mean, here.	Mo tumọ si, nibi.
Whatever this dog wanted, it was yours.	Ohunkohun ti yi aja fe, o je rẹ.
It must be.	O gbọdọ wa.
If this sounds like you, try.	Ti eyi ba dun bi iwọ, gbiyanju.
That is who he is.	Ẹniti o jẹ niyẹn.
His mother stood and looked back.	Iya rẹ duro o si wo ẹhin.
She walked out to see him sitting outside.	O rin jade lati ri i joko ni ita.
They have a lot of amazing materials.	Wọn ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun elo iyanu.
It will take a long time.	Yoo gba to gun pupọ.
I obviously think this is a good thing.	Mo han gbangba pe eyi jẹ ohun ti o dara.
He did a lot of it.	O ṣe pupọ julọ ninu rẹ.
Much has changed this year.	Pupọ ti yipada ni ọdun yii.
Make your picture.	Ṣe aworan rẹ.
He didn't have to see anything.	Ko ni lati ri nkankan.
If they just changed their mind, everything would be all right.	Ti wọn ba kan yi ọkan wọn pada, ohun gbogbo yoo ti dara.
Place of birth.	Ibi ti a ti bi ni.
I can't say how it looked.	Nko le so bi o ti ri.
We were in the same unit.	A wà ni kanna kuro.
I mean something that is also thought.	Mo tumọ si ohun kan ti o tun jẹ ero.
You are not who others think you are.	Iwọ kii ṣe ẹniti awọn miiran ro pe o jẹ.
But every time you can feel yourself opening up.	Ṣugbọn ni gbogbo igba o le rilara pe ararẹ n ṣii soke.
A baby is born every minute.	A bi ọmọ ni gbogbo iṣẹju.
The sister said.	Arabinrin naa ti sọ.
This is good for me.	Eyi dara fun mi.
If nothing, it is nothing.	Ti ko ba si nkankan, kii ṣe nkankan.
There are many to consider.	Ọpọlọpọ wa lati ṣe akiyesi.

Your age does not matter to me, it does matter to me.	Ọjọ ori rẹ ko ṣe pataki fun mi, o ṣe pataki si mi.

Not with me, but with him.	Kii ṣe pẹlu mi, ṣugbọn pẹlu rẹ.
You never want to see him again.	O ko fẹ lati wo i lẹẹkansi.
Of course you know.	Dajudaju o mọ.
He was happy with himself.	Inu re dun si ara re.
Not here.	Ko si nibi.
You have nothing against me.	O ko nkankan si mi.
In fact, no one.	Ni otitọ, ko si ẹnikan.
This is incredibly hard.	Eleyi jẹ ti iyalẹnu lile.
It really pulled me through a lot.	O fa mi gaan nipasẹ pupọ.
I give him money if he lets me do something.	Mo fun u ni owo ti o ba jẹ ki n ṣe nkan kan.
There is no work after that.	Ko si iṣẹ lẹhin eyi.
This takes me a very long way to draw.	Eyi gba mi ni ọna pipẹ pupọ lati fa.
It turns out that this is not even possible.	O wa jade pe eyi paapaa ko ṣee ṣe.
To see him is to love him.	Lati ri i ni lati nifẹ rẹ.
Maybe we should have seen it coming, but we didn’t.	Boya a yẹ ki o ti rii pe o nbọ, ṣugbọn a ko ṣe.
Tell them you are hearing things.	Sọ fun wọn pe o n gbọ awọn ohun.
Time will tell whether my mind has changed.	Akoko yoo sọ boya ero mi ti yipada.
Is your father back?	Baba rẹ pada wa?
I do not believe that.	Emi ko gbagbọ pe.
I am worried about the baby.	Mo n ṣe aniyan nipa ọmọ naa.
Make more rules.	Ṣe awọn ofin diẹ sii.
It even writes you out of a statement.	O paapaa kọ ọ jade ninu alaye kan.
But not because of love for him.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe nitori ifẹ fun u.
I thought the morning would work, but not yet.	Mo ro pe owurọ yoo ṣiṣẹ, ṣugbọn ko tii sibẹsibẹ.
Do you have a good trip?	Ṣe o ni irin-ajo to dara?
You can sleep now, and you have to sleep.	O le sun ni bayi, o si ni lati sun.
No agreement is possible.	Ko si adehun ṣee ṣe.
And breakfast.	Ati ki o jẹ ounjẹ owurọ.
Some people live in their hometown.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan joko ni ilu wọn.
It was not much.	O je ko Elo.
He was not afraid of me.	Ko bẹru mi.
And no one is right.	Ati pe ko si ọkan ti o jẹ otitọ.
There are two ways you can do this.	Awọn ọna meji lo wa ti o le ṣe eyi.
I never asked.	Emi ko beere rara.
But we still do not know how to do this.	Ṣugbọn a ko tun mọ bi a ṣe le ṣe eyi.
No one was really scared.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o bẹru gaan.
Keep to yourself.	Pa ara mi mọ.
And the night before.	Ati alẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
I remember everything now.	Mo ranti ohun gbogbo ni bayi.
He just doesn’t have a hand anymore.	O kan ko ni ọwọ mọ.
No letter for me.	Ko si lẹta fun mi.
I need to find something.	Mo nilo lati wa nkankan.
I want to say.	Mo fe so.
It is on both sides.	O wa ni ẹgbẹ mejeeji.
I kept my thoughts to myself.	Mo pa ero mi mọ si ara mi.
However that is in his mind.	Sibẹsibẹ iyẹn wa ninu ọkan rẹ.
Until it's too late.	Titi o fi pẹ ju.
I want to take it with me.	Mo fe lati mu u pẹlu mi.
The word is yours and yours alone.	Ọrọ naa jẹ tirẹ ati tirẹ nikan.
You don’t get that.	O ko gba iyẹn.
If you do not have the space to go you can stay with us.	Ti o ko ba ni aaye lati lọ o le duro pẹlu wa.
Nothing came out.	Ko si ohun ti o jade.
But the teacher can’t do it for you.	Ṣugbọn olukọ ko le ṣe fun ọ.
You will be completely different.	Iwọ yoo dabi ẹni miiran patapata.
He is very intelligent.	O ni oye pupọ.
To find the boys and beat them up.	Lati wa awọn ọmọkunrin ati ki o lu wọn soke.
It should not look like this.	Ko yẹ ki o dabi eyi.
To do so after was.	Lati ṣe bẹ lẹhin wà.
There is a rule.	Ofin kan wa.
The plane took off.	Ọkọ ofurufu naa gun.
He will be back in a minute.	Oun yoo pada wa ni iṣẹju kan.
Maybe we should all be honest and truthful.	Boya o yẹ ki gbogbo wa jẹ otitọ ati otitọ.
They can cause great harm.	Wọn le fa ipalara nla.
That we can not do.	Ti a ko le ṣe.
They’re saying everything is fine.	Wọn n sọ pe ohun gbogbo dara.
Think of me as you would like.	Ronu mi bi o ṣe fẹ.
Nice to see you again.	O dara lati ri ọ lẹẹkansi.
Every woman needs to know how to help.	Gbogbo obinrin ni lati mọ bi a ṣe le ran.
He looked at her face.	O wo oju rẹ.
Maybe they will bring us, maybe not.	Boya wọn yoo mu wa, boya kii ṣe.
If it is good, people will buy it.	Ti o ba dara, eniyan yoo ra.
We caught up with him yesterday.	A mu pẹlu rẹ lana.
He put his hand over his mouth.	O gbe ọwọ rẹ si ẹnu rẹ.
The price is too high.	Iye owo naa ga ju.
However you will.	Sibẹsibẹ iwọ yoo.
But he is.	Sugbon oun niyen.
He passed her and went before she could reach him.	O ti kọja rẹ ati lọ ṣaaju ki o le de ọdọ rẹ.
He knows his craft better than anyone.	O mọ iṣẹ ọna rẹ ju ẹnikẹni lọ.
The store is a little more than that.	Ile itaja jẹ diẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
A man who never, ever, wanted to see again.	Ọkunrin kan ti ko, lailai, fẹ lati ri lẹẹkansi.
All of that was probably true.	Gbogbo awọn ti o wà jasi otitọ.
I pulled away, I turned my back to him.	Mo fa kuro, Mo yi ẹhin mi pada si ọdọ rẹ.
Not the best thing to tell my mother.	Kii ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ lati sọ fun iya mi.
We want that to stop.	A fẹ ki iyẹn duro.
Some people love it, and some people hate it.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan nifẹ rẹ, ati diẹ ninu awọn eniyan korira rẹ.
And that’s the best way we’ve ever written.	Ati pe iyẹn ni ọna ti o dara julọ ti a kọ.
Not easy, but easy.	Ko rọrun, ṣugbọn rọrun.
I know how to use that thing.	Mo mọ bi mo ṣe le lo nkan yẹn.
The trip was planned to last several days.	A ti gbero irin-ajo naa lati ṣiṣe ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọjọ.
We still do not know why.	A ko tun mọ kini idi naa.
In a fast-paced world, everyone wants everything right now.	Ninu aye ti o yara yara, gbogbo eniyan fẹ ohun gbogbo ni bayi.
Just think it is.	O kan ro pe o jẹ.
That is one of the best things we can do.	Iyẹn jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ohun ti a dara julọ ni.
I'll be back in bed now.	Emi yoo pada si ibusun ni bayi.
People turned to look at the girl.	Awọn eniyan yipada lati wo ọmọbirin naa.
People have been arrested for this.	Awọn eniyan ti mu fun eyi.
He stopped and looked.	O duro ati ki o wo.
They want to kill me.	Wọn fẹ lati pa mi.
That does not mean it is completely true.	Iyẹn ko tumọ si pe o ti jẹ otitọ patapata.
It is well priced.	O ti wa ni owo daradara.
It was a status quo for them.	O jẹ nkan ipo fun wọn.
To some people.	Si diẹ ninu awọn eniyan.
It may now be too late.	O le bayi ti pẹ ju.
Of course it did to me.	Dajudaju o ṣe si mi.
It does not seem so.	Ko dabi bẹ.
Learn to let mistakes go.	Kọ ẹkọ lati jẹ ki awọn aṣiṣe lọ.
Cats are under the table.	Ologbo wa labẹ tabili.
Don't you think we should go?	Ṣe o ko ro pe o yẹ ki a lọ?
You drive in the wrong direction.	O wakọ ni ọna ti ko tọ.
We tried to run but our feet could not move.	A gbiyanju lati sare ṣugbọn ẹsẹ wa ko le gbe.
That year.	Ni ọdun yẹn.
And another one after that.	Ati ọkan miiran lẹhin naa.
The mother and baby walk along the beach.	Iya ati ọmọ naa rin ni eti okun.
For some reason it stuck on this question.	Fun idi kan o di lori ibeere yii.
However, our question must not end here.	Sibẹsibẹ, ibeere wa ko gbọdọ pari nibi.
The work is almost complete.	Iṣẹ naa ti fẹrẹ pari.
This week it gives them a lot to think about.	Ni ọsẹ yii o fun wọn ni ọpọlọpọ lati ronu.
I have used it for a long time without problems.	Mo ti lo fun igba pipẹ laisi awọn iṣoro.
I also know it’s good for him.	Mo tun mọ pe o dara fun u.
You do not need to return one of your own.	O ko nilo lati da ọkan ninu tirẹ pada.
It will be better to finish this tomorrow.	Yoo dara lati pari eyi ni ọla.
Just get bad advice.	O kan gba imọran buburu.
It is the same in art as in life.	O jẹ kanna ni aworan bi ni igbesi aye.
I hope you can hear me now.	Mo nireti pe o le gbọ mi ni bayi.
This is not something to be afraid of, however.	Eyi kii ṣe ohun ti o bẹru, sibẹsibẹ.
You, a mother stay at home.	Iwọ, iya kan duro ni ile.
Those who have more, want everything.	Awọn ti o ni diẹ sii, fẹ ohun gbogbo.
My father thought it would be educational.	Baba mi ro pe yoo jẹ ẹkọ.
This is an important rule.	Eyi jẹ ofin pataki.
Not my truth.	Kii ṣe otitọ mi.
This is what they are for.	Eyi ni ohun ti wọn jẹ fun.
You want to bring those ideas back with you.	O fẹ mu awọn ero yẹn pada pẹlu rẹ.
I dread this man.	Mo bẹru ọkunrin yii.
But education does more.	Ṣugbọn ẹkọ ṣe diẹ sii.
He worked his way around to his front.	O ṣiṣẹ ọna rẹ ni ayika si iwaju rẹ.
I know that much.	Mo mọ pe Elo.
Now they are here.	Bayi wọn wa nibi.
And tomorrow.	Ati ọla.
We all need that from time to time.	Gbogbo wa nilo iyẹn lati igba de igba.
He is very interested in her.	O nifẹ pupọ si i.
I hate it so much.	Mo korira rẹ gidigidi.
That has left many people out of a job.	Iyẹn ti fi ọpọlọpọ eniyan silẹ kuro ninu iṣẹ kan.
You need to make your own decisions.	O nilo lati ṣe awọn ipinnu tirẹ.
We should assist the police in every way we can.	A yẹ ki o ran ọlọpa lọwọ ni gbogbo ọna ti a le.
Or both or neither.	Tabi mejeeji tabi bẹni.
It does not take any energy at all.	Ko gba agbara kankan rara.
You can stay there.	O le duro nibẹ.
At least something like that.	O kere nkankan bi iyẹn.
A decision needs to be made.	A ipinnu nilo lati ṣe.
It’s my life, your life, anyone’s life.	O jẹ igbesi aye mi, igbesi aye rẹ, igbesi aye ẹnikẹni.
There is a small error that causes the problem.	Aṣiṣe kekere kan wa ti o fa iṣoro naa.
He did not let her.	Ko jẹ ki rẹ.
My husband was also there with my father.	Ọkọ mi tun wa nibẹ pẹlu baba mi.
He told her he was in his car seat.	O sọ fun u pe o wa lori ijoko ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ.
They fill the space.	Wọn kun aaye naa.
We will not need information about them in this book.	A kii yoo nilo alaye nipa wọn ninu iwe yii.
Make things easier for yourself.	Ṣe awọn nkan rọrun fun ara rẹ.
Names you have no eyes for.	Awọn orukọ ti o ko ni oju fun.
These people can be kept.	A le pa awọn eniyan wọnyi mọ.
I hope it will be good.	Mo nireti pe yoo dara.
He almost made a deal.	O fẹrẹ ṣe adehun kan.
I have never been angry, before or since, with a man.	Emi ko binu rara, ṣaaju tabi lati igba yii, pẹlu ọkunrin kan.
I have no love for this.	Emi ko ni ifẹ fun eyi.
I put everything into it.	Mo fi ohun gbogbo sinu rẹ.
Try it, you will see.	Gbiyanju o, iwọ yoo rii.
Let everyone sleep.	Jẹ ki gbogbo eniyan sun.
Which is very tasty.	Eyi ti o dun pupọ.
The trip will take three months.	Irin-ajo naa yoo gba oṣu mẹta.
Nothing that anyone can tell you at that time.	Ko si eyi ti ẹnikẹni le sọ fun ọ ni akoko yẹn.
You can have some great pictures in place.	O le ni diẹ ninu awọn aworan nla ni ibi.
Nothing.	Ko si ohun ti.
They do not know what kind of trouble they are in.	Wọn ko mọ iru wahala ti wọn wa.
Insert a wooden spoon.	Fi igi igi sii.
This is not the kind of thing you understand very well.	Eyi kii ṣe iru ohun ti o loye daradara.
Not that way.	Kii ṣe ọna yẹn.
I think it could be more than that.	Mo ro pe o le jẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
These have to break well.	Awọn wọnyi ni lati fọ daradara.
The rooms are small.	Awọn yara wa ni kekere.
By ???????????? 	Nipasẹ ????????????
Lots of cars.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
Time to get back inside.	Akoko lati pada si inu.
Time and again.	Igba ati lẹẹkansi.
Before it's too late.	Ṣaaju ki o to pẹ ju.
Maybe he will do it honestly.	Boya oun yoo ṣe e ni otitọ.
We'll see how it goes tomorrow.	A yoo wo bi ọla ṣe lọ.
I am on fire.	Mo wa lori ina.
We can never let that happen.	A ko le jẹ ki a ronu iyẹn lailai.
I am not your father.	Emi kii ṣe baba rẹ.
Take a break.	Gba isinmi diẹ.
Your body type with your mother and your body.	Iru ara rẹ pẹlu iya rẹ ati ara rẹ.
I can not sleep.	Nko le sun.
It’s time to move on with it.	O to akoko lati tẹsiwaju pẹlu rẹ.
I will do so many times.	Emi yoo ṣe bẹ ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
A great room.	Yara nla kan.
Just do it.	O kan ṣe.
We have every reason to kill ourselves.	A ni gbogbo idi lati pa ara wa.
The first company is a.	Ile-iṣẹ akọkọ ni a.
There is something for everyone here.	Nkankan wa fun gbogbo eniyan nibi.
They are now.	Wọn ti wa ni bayi.
I can’t, of course.	Emi ko le, dajudaju.
Thirty children lost their mothers.	Ọgbọn ọmọ padanu iya wọn.
I took lunch.	Mo gba ọsan kuro.
Where do you think a child can be?	Nibo ni o ro pe ọmọ le wa?
I do not know what to do.	Emi ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
Do what you can.	Ṣe ohun ti o le mu.
We are buying a group.	A n ra ẹgbẹ kan.
You will see that they are.	Iwọ yoo rii pe wọn wa.
He lives near the beach.	O ngbe nitosi eti okun.
I think it is the way it should be done.	Mo ro pe o jẹ ọna ti o yẹ ki o ṣe.
You agree.	O gba.
They will not.	Wọn kii yoo.
The story is almost open.	Itan naa ti fẹrẹ ṣii.
Very surprising to me.	Iyalẹnu pupọ fun mi gaan.
You know me, you do.	O mọ mi, o ṣe.
He received a letter in the name of the company.	O gba lẹta kan ni orukọ ile-iṣẹ naa.
You have done your job well.	O ti ṣe iṣẹ rẹ daradara.
Call with any questions !.	Pe pẹlu eyikeyi ibeere!.
You can let it go.	O le jẹ ki o lọ.
Go get some.	Lọ gba diẹ ninu.
The day is over.	Ọjọ pari.
Look and see.	Wo ki o si ri.
This is the whole point.	Eyi ni gbogbo aaye.
And they will need that help.	Ati pe wọn yoo nilo iranlọwọ naa.
And even a big one.	Ati nla kan paapaa.
I can see what he did.	Mo le rii ohun ti o ṣe.
For us, right now, that world is no more.	Fun wa, ni bayi, aye yẹn ko si mọ.
It’s easy to be with people.	O rọrun lati wa pẹlu eniyan.
Hot days.	Awọn ọjọ ti n gbona.
It doesn't look bad.	O ko dabi buburu.
You need to leave this point, right now.	O nilo lati lọ kuro ni aaye yii, ni bayi.
So we look.	Nitorina a wo.
No one seems to know exactly who owns the company.	Ko si ẹniti o dabi ẹni pe o mọ ẹniti o ni ile-iṣẹ naa gaan.
But you know me.	Ṣugbọn o mọ mi.
Some aircraft are better than others.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọkọ ofurufu dara julọ ju awọn miiran lọ.
I can’t agree with that conclusion.	Emi ko le gba pẹlu ipari yẹn.
That was a time for reassurance.	Iyẹn jẹ akoko kan fun idaniloju.
We read and listen.	A ka a si gbọ.
I went to myself.	Mo ti lọ si ara mi.
But maybe there is another way.	Ṣugbọn boya ọna miiran wa.
He’s asking me to change.	O n beere lọwọ mi lati yipada.
Here, this hot water.	Nibi, omi gbona yii.
Those who pay for it know it.	Awon ti o san fun o mọ o.
I sat there trying to think.	Mo ti joko nibẹ gbiyanju lati ro.
This is not a good look.	Eyi kii ṣe oju ti o dara.
My parents are good.	Awọn obi mi dara.
They could not send me to such a person.	Wọn ko le fi mi ranṣẹ si iru eniyan bẹẹ.
Much is known about that.	Pupọ diẹ ni a mọ nipa iyẹn.
You are completely hated.	O ti wa ni patapata korira.
They have to believe me.	Wọn ni lati gbagbọ mi.
I lost the desire to kill.	Mo ti padanu ifẹ lati pa.
I don’t know why they won’t change.	Emi ko mọ idi ti wọn kii yoo yipada.
We do not have to buy.	A ko ni lati ra.
I call them out for what they are.	Mo pe wọn jade fun ohun ti wọn jẹ.
The police arrived an hour ago.	Awọn ọlọpa de ni wakati kan sẹhin.
These people have a lot of kids.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde.
Both seem to work well.	Mejeeji dabi lati ṣiṣẹ daradara.
There are many of them.	Ọpọlọpọ wọn wa.
I knew it would work, and it did.	Mo mọ pe yoo ṣiṣẹ, ati pe o ṣe.
Other stories are similar.	Awọn itan miiran jẹ iru.
I am a boy, he can't do that.	Ọmọkunrin ni mi, ko le ṣe iyẹn.
You haven’t put it into those words.	O ko ti fi i sinu awọn ọrọ yẹn.
Let it be.	Jẹ ki o wa.
I think they are good.	Mo ro pe wọn dara.
There is also an opportunity in the first of next week.	Anfani tun wa ni akọkọ ti ọsẹ to nbọ.
Good times, good times.	Awọn akoko ti o dara, awọn akoko ti o dara.
But they can not wait.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko le duro.
He refused to move.	O kọ lati gbe.
We will sleep late.	A yoo sun pẹ.
But enough about them.	Sugbon to nipa wọn.
This marriage did not do well.	Igbeyawo yii ko ṣe ohun ti o dara.
Leave as.	Fi silẹ bi .
Missed opportunity.	Anfani ti o padanu.
I did so, it never worked again.	Mo ṣe bẹ, ko tun ṣiṣẹ.
Eat small.	Je nkan kekere.
Something decided about it that you liked.	Ohun kan ti pinnu nipa rẹ ti o fẹran.
Wait a little longer.	Duro diẹ diẹ.
It's a small room.	Yara kekere kan ni.
But it still goes.	Sugbon o tun n lọ.
We love the word.	A nifẹ ọrọ naa.
I learned some.	Mo kọ diẹ ninu.
And you are right.	Ati pe o tọ.
I refused.	Mo kọ silẹ.

Would you like a cup of tea?	Ṣe iwọ yoo tọju ife tii kan?
Have to wake up early for work.	Ni lati ji ni kutukutu fun iṣẹ.
It has no power.	O ko ni agbara.
I will never meet them again.	Emi kii yoo pade wọn lẹẹkansi.
The same thing I say to them all the time.	Ohun kanna ni mo sọ fun wọn ni gbogbo igba.
Let him think it is worth your time.	Jẹ ki o ro pe o tọ akoko rẹ.
I expected as much.	Mo ti reti bi Elo.
There is no time to lose.	Ko si akoko lati padanu.
I did not give them anything.	Emi ko fun wọn ni nkankan.
I would do better but this is really low and very hard.	Emi yoo ṣe dara julọ ṣugbọn eyi jẹ kekere gaan ati lile pupọ.
They are married.	Won ni iyawo.
It is not an easy way up.	Kii ṣe ọna ti o rọrun si oke.
And what you have.	Ati ohun ti o ni.
And, well, we are two sides of the same coin.	Ati pe, daradara, a jẹ awọn ẹgbẹ meji ti owo kan naa.
And it is completely true.	Ati pe o jẹ otitọ patapata.
Do not tell anyone about us.	Maṣe sọ fun ẹnikan nipa wa.
Something special.	Nkan pataki.
And see where you got them.	Ki o si wo ibi ti o ti gba wọn.
They talk about the weather.	Wọn sọrọ nipa oju ojo.
You are wrong.	O ko tọ.
That decision is on the bill.	Ipinnu yẹn wa lori iwe ofin.
He did not close his eyes.	O ko di oju rẹ.
Look at the puppy!	Wo ọmọ aja naa!
We are afraid because we did not grow up with them.	A bẹru nitori a ko dagba pẹlu wọn.
He did his job.	O ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
And good news.	Ati awọn iroyin ti o dara.
Keep in touch!.	Wa nitosi!.
I just thought myself up there.	Mo ti o kan ro ara mi soke nibẹ.
You are doing a good job.	O n ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara.
He was sitting alone in the party hall.	O joko nikan ni ibi ayẹyẹ naa.
It comes with another purpose.	O wa pẹlu idi miiran.
It does not change because it is around other people.	Ko yipada nitori pe o wa ni ayika awọn eniyan miiran.
It will just be fun.	O kan yoo jẹ fun.
Good money and good rewards.	Ti o dara owo ati ti o dara ere.
I made a mistake.	Mo ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
I will show you the world.	Emi yoo fi aye han ọ.
None of the other kids did anything.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ọmọde miiran ti o ṣe ohun kan.
Sure they made for amazing pictures.	Daju pe wọn ṣe fun awọn aworan iyalẹnu.
We only knew each other one day.	A ti mọ ara wa nikan ni ọjọ kan.
I did not sleep.	Emi ko sun.
That is a very long time.	Ti o jẹ igba pipẹ pupọ.
Behind this table.	Lẹhin tabili yii.
Books have the power to change lives.	Awọn iwe ni agbara lati yi igbesi aye pada.
I do not like to do so.	Emi ko nifẹ lati ṣe bẹ.
You know what that means.	O mọ ohun ti yoo tumọ si.
It is done.	O ti ṣe.
Just let me talk that.	O kan jẹ ki n sọrọ naa.
He will make any decision that is best for him.	Oun yoo ṣe ipinnu eyikeyi ti o dara julọ fun u.
You know, kind of personal.	O mọ, iru ti ara ẹni.
But no, no, no.	Ṣugbọn rara, rara, ko si.
He turned and jumped.	O yipada o si fo.
They told us to come back.	Wọn sọ fun wa lati pada.
The truth is physical.	Otitọ si ti ara.
People will forget what happened here today.	Awọn eniyan yoo gbagbe ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nibi loni.
We can make room.	A le ṣe yara.
It made me want to laugh.	O mu mi fẹ lati rẹrin.
I saw the name but did not think anything of it.	Mo ti ri orukọ ṣugbọn ko ro ohunkohun ti o.
He agreed and the agreement happened.	O gba ati pe adehun naa ṣẹlẹ.
I don’t think they will kill you.	Emi ko ro pe wọn yoo pa ọ.
Help him feel better!	Ran u lero dara!
I stand in front.	Mo duro ni iwaju.
Tell me where I took you.	Sọ fun mi ibiti mo ti mu ọ.
None of these things.	Ko si ọkan ninu nkan wọnyi.
To be, or not to be.	Lati jẹ, tabi kii ṣe.
I believe our whole life will be better.	Mo gbagbọ pe gbogbo igbesi aye wa yoo dara julọ.
Anything that happens in the man’s head is not beautiful.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni ori ọkunrin naa kii ṣe lẹwa.
It was a huge surprise.	O jẹ iyalẹnu nla julọ.
Our dog is always happy.	Inu aja wa dun ni gbogbo igba.
You have to look at every single person.	O ni lati wo gbogbo eniyan kan.
It was not a car accident.	Kii ṣe ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
In many ways, that is true.	Ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna, iyẹn jẹ otitọ.
A high place.	Ibi giga kan.
The accident caused some serious injuries.	Ijamba naa fa awọn ipalara nla kan.
They sell well.	Wọn ta daradara.
They should be one and the same.	Wọn yẹ ki o jẹ ọkan ati kanna.
There are not many.	Nibẹ ni o wa ko ọpọlọpọ.
Not forever.	Kii ṣe lailai.
It must have worked for weeks.	O gbọdọ ti ṣiṣẹ fun awọn ọsẹ.
The song is a little annoying now.	Orin naa ti binu diẹ ni bayi.
It can be a great job for him.	O le jẹ iṣẹ nla fun u.
Parents have to take care of themselves with respect.	Awọn obi ni lati tọju ara wọn pẹlu ọwọ.
But it’s good to remember.	Ṣugbọn o dara lati ranti.
It looks like a perfect day.	O dabi ọjọ ti o yẹ.
It comes with the money itself.	O wa pẹlu owo naa funrararẹ.
You know a lot.	O mọ pupọ.
We can understand what you wrote.	A le loye ohun ti o kọ.
To pass them is not possible.	Lati kọja wọn ko ṣee ṣe.
You heard it on the phone.	O gbọ rẹ lori foonu.
Way to go with the whole book !.	Ọna lati lọ pẹlu gbogbo iwe!.
Now it’s a journey.	Bayi o jẹ irin-ajo.
This is the only store open at this time.	Eyi ni ile itaja nikan ti o ṣii ni akoko yii.
Would love to talk to their parents for a few minutes.	Yoo nifẹ lati ba awọn obi wọn sọrọ fun iṣẹju diẹ.
I learned more on board.	Mo kọ diẹ sii lori ọkọ.
Not when someone showed me wrong.	Kii ṣe igba ti ẹnikan fi han mi ni aṣiṣe.
You do not need to tell them.	O ko nilo lati sọ fun wọn.
I also, off.	Mo tun, pa.
Obviously, you can tell us more about.	O han ni, o le sọ fun wa diẹ sii nipa.
Come on, you can also swim.	Wa, o tun le we.
That's the only problem.	Iyẹn nikan ni iṣoro naa.
Beat it a good.	Lu rẹ kan ti o dara.
He had given her money, but she did not accept it.	O ti fun u ni owo, ṣugbọn ko gba.
I just want to see your face.	Mo kan fẹ lati ri oju rẹ.
If you do not, you should not.	Ti o ko ba ṣe bẹ, o tun yẹ ko.
He reached the small house.	O de ile kekere naa.
That is true love, in my opinion.	Iyẹn jẹ ifẹ otitọ, ni ero mi.
You have to help them.	O ni lati ran wọn lọwọ.
There is a service around.	Iṣẹ kan wa ni ayika.
Your time is up.	Akoko re ti pari.
But he could not return.	Ṣugbọn ko le si pada.
It was there.	O ti wa nibẹ.
You may not be on the train.	O le ma wa lori ọkọ oju irin.
I am here for you too.	Mo wa nibi fun ọ pẹlu.
He didn't even know that.	Paapaa ko mọ iyẹn.
He looked at his father's picture.	O wo aworan baba rẹ.
I can’t stand there, of course.	Emi ko le duro nibẹ, dajudaju.
Or, at least, know that you do.	Tabi, o kere ju, mọ pe o ṣe.
It will take too much room.	Yoo gba yara pupọ ju.
What is your favorite type of music?	Kini iru orin ayanfẹ rẹ?
At least that’s how it started.	O kere ju iyẹn ni bii o ṣe bẹrẹ.
It happens like this.	O ṣẹlẹ bi eleyi.
I hate it for you, you know.	Mo korira rẹ fun o, o mọ.
Every child should learn some music.	Gbogbo ọmọde yẹ ki o ni ẹkọ diẹ ninu orin.
Perhaps there is a good reason for this.	Boya idi pataki kan wa fun eyi.
We have no children.	A ko ni awọn ọmọde.
So no one will.	Nitorina ko si ọkan yoo.
He’s here somewhere, and he’s in trouble.	O wa nibi kan, o si wa ninu wahala.
Now it is lost even before winter.	Bayi o padanu paapaa ṣaaju igba otutu.
That is the cause of harm.	Ohun to fa ipalara niyen.
Some rules apply to you.	Awọn ofin kan si ọ.
For a minute, my friend was happy.	Fun iṣẹju kan, ọrẹ mi dun.
However, this works to our advantage.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi ṣiṣẹ si anfani wa.
This is not my life.	Eyi kii ṣe igbesi aye mi.
I will get out of your way.	Emi yoo kuro ni ọna rẹ.
She worried about him.	O ṣe aniyan fun u.
He never came back.	O ko pada wa.
I love your brother too.	Mo nifẹ arakunrin rẹ pẹlu.
They don’t get the right pictures.	Wọn ko gba awọn aworan ti o tọ.
However, even this system has stopped.	Sibẹsibẹ, paapaa eto yii ti duro.
Whether it works or not.	Boya o ṣiṣẹ tabi ko ṣe.
It goes with.	O lọ pẹlu.
But everything else, too.	Ṣugbọn ohun gbogbo miiran, ju.
No information required.	Ko nilo alaye.
The boat is now in the water.	Ọkọ naa ti wa ninu omi bayi.
At least.	O kere.
I was afraid to sleep.	Mo bẹru lati sun.
You’ve seen it around before, especially.	O ti rii ni ayika ṣaaju, paapaa.
Their other son married the girl.	Ọmọkunrin wọn miiran fẹ ọmọbirin naa.
But he did very well.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe dara julọ.
You don’t believe me.	O ko gbagbọ mi.
I am tired.	O ti rẹ mi.
You think you want the same thing you did.	O ro pe o fẹ ohun kanna ti o ṣe.
I visited many historical sites.	Mo ṣabẹwo si ọpọlọpọ awọn aaye itan.
But he did.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe.
Get my hands on it!	Gba ọwọ mi!
But you can see it again.	Ṣugbọn o le tun ri i lẹẹkansi.
Perhaps the same is true of places.	Boya kanna jẹ otitọ ti awọn aaye.
The whole house is around.	Gbogbo ile ni ayika.
He wants to feel it.	O fe lati lero o.
The doors open.	Awọn ilẹkun ṣi.
No problem with that.	Ko si iṣoro pẹlu iyẹn.
I need your advice.	Mo nilo imọran rẹ.
He looked again.	O tun wo lẹẹkansi.
It has dropped through my class a few times.	O ti lọ silẹ nipasẹ mi kilasi kan diẹ ni igba.
The words are simple, but not easy to say.	Awọn ọrọ naa rọrun, ṣugbọn kii ṣe rọrun lati sọ.
Our understanding is not needed.	Oye wa ko nilo.
He paused for a few minutes and looked.	O duro fun iṣẹju diẹ ki o wo.
You have to know.	O ni lati mọ.
We have to do the same.	A ni lati ṣe kanna.
Children grow up.	Awọn ọmọde dagba.
You know it.	O mọ ọ.
You are not happy.	Inu re ko dun.
Old things, my father said.	Awọn nkan atijọ, baba mi sọ.
We live the best we can.	A n gbe ohun ti o dara julọ ti a le.
You have to hope.	O ni lati nireti.
I will, soon too let it pass.	Emi yoo, laipẹ ju jẹ ki o kọja.
I just want to make sure it’s there.	Mo kan fẹ lati rii daju pe o wa nibẹ.
There is nothing in it.	Ko si nkankan ninu rẹ.
He doesn't know when.	Ko mọ igba ti o to.
A ko pade.	A ko pade.
His mother alone.	Iya rẹ nikan.
And that’s just the obvious ways.	Ati pe iyẹn nikan ni awọn ọna ti o han gbangba.
Now, get out of that bed.	Bayi, jade kuro ni ibusun yẹn.
He also received a one-year gift.	O tun gba ẹbun ọdun kan.
There was no question in my mind.	Ko si ibeere kan ninu ọkan mi.
He did not know what else to do.	Ko mọ kini ohun miiran lati ṣe.
You know it's true.	O mọ pe otitọ ni.
We've missed out on so much.	A ti sọ padanu jade lori ki Elo.
We were there for a long time.	A wa nibẹ fun igba pipẹ.
Of course you can.	Dajudaju o le.
It is not a matter of meaning.	Kii ṣe ọrọ ti o tumọ si.
It is known to have several cars.	O ti mọ lati ni awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ pupọ.
This is possible, even if it will not be easy.	Eyi ṣee ṣe, paapaa ti kii yoo rọrun.
I closed my eyes and tried to remember.	Mo ti pa oju mi ​​​​mo si gbiyanju lati ranti.
She was left in clothes that stood in nothing else.	O ti fi silẹ ni awọn aṣọ ti o duro ni ko si ohun miiran.
I forgot to call you back.	Mo gbagbe lati pe e pada.
It is also important to use the energy you have with wisdom.	O tun ṣe pataki lati lo agbara ti o ni pẹlu ọgbọn.
We would not want to see that happen to you.	A ko ni fẹ lati rii pe iyẹn ṣẹlẹ si ọ.
It was my job to clean the room.	O je mi ise lati nu awọn yara.
Please help us out !.	Jọwọ ran wa jade!.
If you need help with this, find a doctor.	Ti o ba nilo iranlọwọ pẹlu eyi, wa dokita kan.
Now they are with me.	Bayi ni o wa pẹlu mi.
Everything went well.	Ohun gbogbo ti lọ daradara.
Two months, now.	Awọn oṣu meji, ni bayi.
It does not matter.	Ko ṣe akiyesi.
If you want to stay in place, well and good.	Ti o ba fẹ lati duro lori ibi, daradara ati dara.
I can have men there in the morning.	Mo le ni awọn ọkunrin nibẹ ni owurọ.
About it.	Nipa rẹ.
Run if you can.	Ṣiṣe ti o ba le.
Your city is on fire.	Ilu re ti sun.
That's all there is to it.	Iyẹn nikan ni ọrọ fun.
He said he just wanted to make love.	O sọ pe o kan fẹ ṣe ifẹ.
'hands.	' ọwọ.
The doors are made of wood.	Awọn ilẹkun ti wa ni ṣe ti igi.
I know what you want.	Mo mọ ohun ti o fẹ.
I do not agree.	Emi ko gba.
Of course, he liked the observation.	Dajudaju, o fẹran akiyesi naa.
It can't help but be.	Ko le ṣe iranlọwọ ṣugbọn jẹ.
This is trial and error.	Eyi jẹ idanwo ati aṣiṣe.
He is here.	O si wa nibi.
And you have grown in this.	Ati pe o ti dagba ninu eyi.
Find a place to test it.	Wa aaye kan lati ṣe idanwo rẹ.
I don’t think he would do such a thing.	Emi ko ro pe oun yoo ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ.
You did not have time before, but you will now.	O ko ni akoko ṣaaju, ṣugbọn o yoo bayi.
I have a long way to go.	Mo ni ọna pipẹ lati lọ.
At least you don’t want me to be looking.	O kere o ko fẹ ki n wa.
There are times to think.	Awọn igba miiran wa lati ronu.
The bus did not leave until three o'clock.	Ọkọ naa ko lọ titi di aago mẹta.
I didn’t even know he was still around.	Emi ko paapaa mọ pe o tun wa ni ayika.
Not including financial information.	Ko pẹlu alaye owo alaye.
I took the opportunity to lock my own door.	Mo lo anfani lati ti ilẹkun ara mi.
That is certainly possible.	Iyẹn ṣee ṣe dajudaju.
See what we can come up with.	Wo ohun ti a le wa pẹlu.
As a player.	Bi ẹrọ orin.
Do not change things.	Maṣe yi awọn nkan pada.
They are not sweet at all.	Wọn ko dun rara.
She loves to see my picture.	O nifẹ lati rii aworan mi.
Dogs seem to understand something is happening '.	Awọn aja dabi ẹni pe wọn ni oye ohun kan n ṣẹlẹ'.
They do not get one.	Wọn ko gba ọkan.
That is my promise to you.	Ileri mi fun yin niyen.
But he stopped.	Ṣugbọn o duro.
However his story did not let me go.	Sibẹsibẹ itan rẹ ko jẹ ki n lọ.
Nothing else.	Ko si ohun miiran.
I just think you can know.	Mo kan ro pe o le mọ.
We don’t call ourselves to work.	A ko pe ara wa lati ṣiṣẹ.
Nothing is as important as you.	Ko si ohun pataki bi iwọ.
But he did and he let it be.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe ati pe o jẹ ki o jẹ.
The law could not be further clarified.	Ofin ko le ṣe alaye diẹ sii.
I am renovating our family home.	Mo n tun ile ebi wa ṣe.
The man he met.	Ọkunrin ti o pade.
There was little reason to.	Nibẹ wà kekere idi lati.
It is not something to be afraid of.	Kii ṣe nkan lati bẹru.
We get the feeling that this has already happened.	A gba rilara pe eyi ti ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
A family said.	Ebi kan sọ.
They are a group people.	Wọn jẹ eniyan ẹgbẹ.
I have become such a person.	Mo ti di iru eniyan bẹẹ.
Or suspect something.	Tabi fura nkankan.
I am a year old.	Mo jẹ ẹni igba ọdun.
You can make to book what you have made.	O le ṣe si iwe ohun ti o ti ṣe.
Sometimes you just have to wait and see how it feels.	Nigba miiran o kan ni lati duro ki o wo bi o ṣe lero.
And you do not see the man's face on any of them.	Ati pe o ko ri oju eniyan naa lori eyikeyi ninu wọn.
You can work where you want and when you want.	O le ṣiṣẹ ni ibi ti o fẹ ati nigbati o ba fẹ.
I'll jump when you say jump.	Emi yoo fo nigbati o sọ fo.
And you know, even.	Ati pe o mọ, paapaa.
A group of big houses.	Ẹgbẹ ti awọn ile nla.
The city has many ancient buildings.	Ilu naa ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ile igba atijọ.
I promise, it's worth a look.	Mo ṣe ileri, o tọ a wo.
He seemed to have trouble.	O dabi enipe o ni wahala.
They don’t even talk about that.	Wọn ko paapaa sọrọ nipa iyẹn.
But this is good for me.	Ṣugbọn eyi dara julọ fun mi.
You have seen us, you have seen something.	O ti ri wa, o ti ri nkankan.
No one is there.	Ko si ẹnikan nibẹ.
In minutes it will do nothing for him.	Ni awọn iṣẹju o yoo ṣe ohunkohun fun u.
Police found two missing vehicles.	Ọlọpa ri awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ meji ti o padanu.
You may or may not need to do this.	O le tabi ko le nilo lati ṣe eyi.
That turned out to be a very loving day.	Iyẹn yipada si ọjọ ti o nifẹ pupọ.
In many ways it is understandable.	Ni awọn ọna pupọ o jẹ oye.
So they will know.	Nitorina wọn yoo mọ.
It has long been out.	O ti gun gbe jade.
I think about other people who are there now.	Mo ronu nipa awọn eniyan miiran ti o wa ni bayi.
We can all try.	A le gbiyanju gbogbo wa.
I do not agree on how we can do that.	Emi ko gba bi a ṣe le ṣe iyẹn.
And a lot more when my kids are at home.	Ati pupọ diẹ sii nigbati awọn ọmọ mi wa ni ile.
It's coming in a minute.	O n bọ ni iṣẹju kan.
They killed my mother.	Awon ni won pa iya mi.
I love how it makes me want to be a better man.	Mo nifẹ bi o ṣe jẹ ki mi fẹ lati jẹ ọkunrin ti o dara julọ.
I will know now.	Emi yoo mọ ni bayi.
Everything was fine still.	Ohun gbogbo wà daradara si tun.
It is my favorite.	O jẹ ayanfẹ mi.
And when time allows, he loves the garden.	Ati nigbati akoko ba gba laaye, o nifẹ si ọgba.
You have to laugh really hard.	O ni lati rẹrin gaan.
Please help us.	Jọwọ ran wa lọwọ.
You have already moved things.	O ti gbe awọn nkan lọ tẹlẹ.
I need this to happen.	Mo nilo eyi lati ṣẹlẹ.
There seems to be no way to ask.	O dabi pe ko si ọna lati beere.
Meet your birth parents, your brother.	Pade awọn obi ibi rẹ, arakunrin rẹ.
You don’t want to hurt.	O ko fẹ lati ṣe ipalara.
And we left.	Ati pe a lọ kuro.
It will be more that way in the future.	Yoo jẹ diẹ sii ni ọna yẹn ni ọjọ iwaju.
Anyone can do.	Ẹnikẹni le ṣe.
I'll be here, whatever happens.	Emi yoo wa nibi, ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
This was her passion.	Eleyi je rẹ ife.
Can't remember a time.	Ko le ranti igba kan.
We will be at my parents' place.	A yoo wa ni ibudo obi mi.
My dad took a few.	Baba mi mu kan diẹ.
Maybe you even have one.	Boya o ni ọkan paapaa.
I think something is wrong.	Mo ro pe ohun kan ko tọ.
I have never seen anything in my life.	Emi ko tii ri nkankan ri ninu aye mi.
Are you angry about last night?	Ṣe o binu nipa alẹ ana?
He lives there.	O ngbe nibẹ.
And you should bring these men back.	Ati pe o yẹ ki o mu awọn ọkunrin wọnyi pada.
This can be great.	Eyi le jẹ nla.
This is physical.	Eyi jẹ ti ara.
She tried to help the baby.	O gbiyanju lati ran ọmọ naa lọwọ.
Help is key.	Iranlọwọ ni bọtini.
You want a tree, but no.	O fẹ igi kan, ṣugbọn ko si.
Write down your ideas, especially.	Kọ awọn imọran rẹ, paapaa.
Last week nothing happened.	Ni ọsẹ to kọja ko si nkan ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Everyone, especially children, has a job to do.	Gbogbo eniyan, paapaa awọn ọmọde, ni iṣẹ kan lati ṣe.
That may have been difficult.	Iyẹn le ti nira.
Life was not easy for me.	Igbesi aye ko rọrun fun mi.
It does not seem to matter what you say.	O dabi pe ko ṣe pataki ohun ti o sọ.
They can kill a lot of people.	Wọn le pa ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
He promised to do his best.	O ṣe ileri lati ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
Maybe if you try hard enough you can remember.	Boya ti o ba gbiyanju lile to o le ranti.
Classes have resumed.	Awọn kilasi ti tun bẹrẹ.
Whatever our age, we have to be young.	Eyikeyi ọjọ ori wa, a ni lati jẹ ọdọ.
Just tell us that and.	O kan sọ fun wa pe ati.
Listen to your doctor.	Gbọ dokita rẹ.
Tell me more about this city.	Sọ fun mi diẹ sii nipa ilu yii.
We have that.	A ni iyẹn.
He told me he had done this forever.	O sọ fun mi pe o ti ṣe eyi lailai.
There is a boat here.	Ọkọ oju omi kan wa nibi.
Maybe there is.	Boya o wa.
It is not a bad idea.	Kii ṣe pe ero buburu ni.
I feel it.	Mo lero ohun.
You must have returned to your room.	O gbọdọ ti pada si yara rẹ.
I also have things to learn.	Mo tun ni awọn nkan lati kọ ẹkọ.
I watch them a lot.	Mo wo wọn pupọ.
But you have to be the right person.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati jẹ eniyan ti o tọ.
To have a baby is amazing.	Lati bi ọmọ jẹ iyanu.
It is not my body.	Kii se ara mi.
I want to see if anyone will tell me first.	Mo fẹ lati rii boya ẹnikẹni yoo sọ fun mi ni akọkọ.
This is also in high school.	Eyi tun wa ni ile-iwe giga.
The sea here is wonderful for swimming.	Okun nibi jẹ iyanu fun odo.
I do not.	Emi ko.
It seems everywhere now.	O dabi ibi gbogbo ni bayi.
I was better.	Mo ti dara ju.
That may be your favorite.	Iyẹn le jẹ ayanfẹ rẹ.
And it depends on the season.	Ati pe o da lori akoko wo.
He said this because of my father.	O sọ eyi nitori baba mi.
But that is how you feel to me.	Ṣugbọn bi o ṣe lero si mi niyẹn.
Tell me what you think of the room !.	Sọ fun mi kini o ro ti yara naa!.
Just, you are.	O kan, iwọ wa.
Watch a game.	Wo ere kan.
That includes your people.	Iyẹn pẹlu eniyan rẹ.
The police stopped them.	Ọlọpa da wọn duro.
He certainly could not walk when he was born.	O dajudaju ko le rin nigbati o bi.
This is the best day ever.	Eyi ni ọjọ ti o dara julọ lailai.
It doesn’t look like your face at all.	O ko dabi oju rẹ rara.
He moved but briefly.	O ti gbe sugbon igba diẹ.
He did a lot of my songs.	O ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn orin mi.
It is not love.	Kii ṣe ifẹ.
Most of your head is gone.	Pupọ julọ ori rẹ ti lọ.
It does not help much.	Ko ṣe iranlọwọ nla.
See this picture.	Wo aworan yii.
Not in all ways.	Ko si ni gbogbo awọn ọna.
But let it be so.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki o jẹ bẹ.
They don’t let you play on the plane.	Wọn ko jẹ ki o mu lori ọkọ ofurufu.
The child puts his hand on the table.	Ọmọ naa fi ọwọ rẹ si ori tabili.
At that time nothing could be better than this.	Ni akoko yẹn ko si ohun ti o le dara julọ ju eyi lọ.
And just, it’s really hard.	Ati pe o kan, o nira gaan.
We know for sure now.	A mọ daju pe bayi.
He would not want to move.	Oun yoo ko fẹ lati gbe.
After a few minutes, he shook his head.	Lẹhin iṣẹju diẹ, o mi ori rẹ.
He does not expect to get it in the first place.	Ko nireti pe yoo gba ni akọkọ.
They will not take advice from me or anyone else.	Wọn kii yoo gba imọran lati ọdọ mi tabi ẹnikẹni miiran.
His words changed.	Ọrọ rẹ yipada.
They will not be human if they do not lose their daughter.	Wọn kii yoo jẹ eniyan ti wọn ko ba padanu ọmọbirin wọn.
'action'.	'iṣẹ'.
He hasn't looked back since.	O ko ti wo ẹhin lati igba naa.
They have it.	Wọn ni i.
He will do the test.	Oun yoo ṣe idanwo naa.
You need more than most men.	O nilo diẹ sii ju ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkunrin lọ.
He began to walk.	O bẹrẹ lati rin.
We could not see if something worked until we tried it.	A ko le rii boya nkan kan ṣiṣẹ titi ti a fi gbiyanju rẹ.
But they get you.	Ṣugbọn wọn gba ọ.
Everyone stood by.	Gbogbo eniyan duro ni akiyesi.
It is already there.	O ti wa nibẹ tẹlẹ.
Find the books you read.	Wa awọn iwe ti o ka.
But everything went wrong.	Ṣugbọn ohun gbogbo ti lọ ti ko tọ.
Great technical value, low operating cost.	Iye iṣẹ ọna nla, iye iṣẹ ṣiṣe kekere.
This book is that and it does well.	Iwe yii jẹ iyẹn ati pe o ṣe daradara.
But we tried.	Sugbon a gbiyanju.
However, this is not known.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi ko si mọ.
That is our plan.	Eto wa niyen.
By their own hands.	Nipa ọwọ ara wọn.
He is confident that he can pass the test.	O ni idaniloju pe o le ṣe idanwo naa.
He was born out of his time.	O ti a bi jade ti re akoko.
Can't picture you would have done that.	Ko le aworan ti o yoo ti ṣe pe.
Keep in front of the house.	Pa ni iwaju ile.
I decided to let it be.	Mo pinnu lati jẹ ki o wa.
It could be more than that.	O le jẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
We made no mistake.	A ko ṣe aṣiṣe kankan.
I’m talking about a lot of hair.	Mo sọrọ nipa irun pupọ.
Nor should it be.	Tabi ko yẹ ki o jẹ.
About this point too.	Nipa aaye yii paapaa.
That is the key.	Iyẹn jẹ bọtini.
He refuses to listen.	O kọ lati gbọ.
Was really good.	Wà gan ti o dara.
We have no water.	A ko ri omi.
You can also.	O tun le.
I do not know how to leave.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe le lọ kuro.
Many more companies will be built in the future.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile-iṣẹ diẹ sii yoo kọ ni ọjọ iwaju.
He kept it to himself.	O pa a mọ si ara rẹ.
Find us.	Wa wa wa.
When someone hits you, you kill them.	Nigbati ẹnikan ba lu ọ, o pa wọn.
No one asked us to do it.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o beere fun wa lati ṣe.
Women love it so much.	Awọn obinrin fẹran rẹ pupọ.
Great house with lots of room.	Ile nla pẹlu yara pupọ.
I didn’t ask him about it.	Emi ko beere lọwọ rẹ nipa rẹ.
Water should not just iron.	Omi ko yẹ ki o kan irin.
Just a question of when.	O kan ibeere nigbawo.
Until things go wrong.	Titi ohun ti lọ ti ko tọ.
You look at your pocket watch.	O wo aago apo rẹ.
We can't keep it.	A ko le pa a mọ.
He could not believe that the power was still there.	Ko le gbagbọ pe agbara naa tun wa.
I have a word.	Mo ni ọrọ kan.
We will have to stop this thing.	A yoo ni lati da nkan yii duro.
The students at this point are the students in that school.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ni aaye yii jẹ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ni ile-iwe naa.
But it is not admitted.	Sugbon o ti wa ni ko gba eleyi.
And yet we are, he said.	Ati pe sibẹsibẹ a wa, o sọ.
I already knew that.	Mo ti mọ iyẹn paapaa.
You will do after that.	O yoo ṣe lẹhin iyẹn.
It's time to dump her.	O to akoko lati lọ.
And after that, you don’t pay anything.	Ati lẹhin iyẹn, iwọ ko san ohunkohun.
The work was completed in one day.	Iṣẹ naa ti pari ni ọjọ kan.
There is nothing better than a good sun.	Ko si ohun ti o dara ju oorun ti o dara.
But it was a matter of ideas.	Sugbon o je ohun awon ero.
The kids we spent our days with were amazing.	Awọn ọmọde ti a lo awọn ọjọ wa pẹlu jẹ iyanu.
Listen and enjoy !.	Gbọ ati gbadun!.
The sea is the setting for many stories.	Okun ni eto fun ọpọlọpọ awọn itan.
He looks asleep.	O wo sun oorun.
That did.	Iyẹn ṣe e.
He will leave.	Oun yoo lọ kuro.
I got two things from him.	Mo ti gba nkan meji lati ọdọ rẹ.
And sometimes.	Ati nigba miiran.
However, it is better to do it.	Sibẹsibẹ, o dara ki o ṣe.
I had to get out of here for myself.	Mo ni lati gba ọna lati ibi fun ara mi.
They believe that they know the past and the future.	Wọn gbagbọ pe wọn mọ awọn ohun ti o ti kọja ati ti ojo iwaju.
And every day he stays more.	Ati ni gbogbo ọjọ o duro diẹ sii.
And here you have them.	Ati ki o nibi o ni wọn.
But that’s not what’s happening here.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ nibi.
Look at your watch.	Wo aago rẹ.
Clothes rose.	Aṣọ dide.
However nothing came back.	Sibẹsibẹ ko si nkankan ti o pada.
This woman said what she heard.	Obinrin yii sọ ohun ti o gbọ.
I can not sleep.	Nko le sun.
The work will go to someone who understands.	Iṣẹ naa yoo lọ si ẹnikan ti o ni oye.
You know, of course, they'll talk behind your back.	O mọ, dajudaju, wọn yoo sọrọ lẹhin ẹhin rẹ.
My father died.	Baba mi ku.
The only thing your child needs is time and opportunity.	Nikan ohun ti ọmọ rẹ nilo ni akoko ati anfani.
The fire made the house too hot to move.	Ina jẹ ki ile naa gbona pupọ lati gbe.
It was a week to forget.	O jẹ ọsẹ kan lati gbagbe.
A beautiful summer day	A lẹwa ooru ọjọ
Many died this first winter.	Ọpọlọpọ ku ni igba otutu akọkọ yii.
That was a mistake.	Wipe o jẹ aṣiṣe.
We are a good team.	A jẹ ẹgbẹ ti o dara.
However, it is not easy to find.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko rọrun lati wa.
It all happens by itself.	Gbogbo rẹ ṣẹlẹ funrararẹ.
It takes longer this time.	O gba to gun akoko yi.
I think day by day it should be yours.	Mo ro pe ni ọjọ si ọjọ o yẹ ki o jẹ tirẹ.
Now it makes more sense.	Bayi o ṣe oye diẹ sii.
He’s coming for them.	O n bọ fun wọn.
She looks very upset.	O dabi inu pupọ.
Anyone who has grown up as it should be aware of this.	Ẹnikan ti o ti dagba bi o ti jẹ yẹ ki o mọ eyi.
It makes you touch yourself.	O mu ki o fi ọwọ kan ara rẹ.
I am not hungry.	Ebi ko kan mi.
Love someone, love something.	Nifẹ ẹnikan, nifẹ nkankan.
You are one of the last.	Iwọ jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ti o kẹhin.
You must know that before you return to the city.	O gbọdọ mọ pe ṣaaju ki o to pada si ilu.
For me, every boy is the same.	Fun mi, gbogbo ọmọkunrin jẹ kanna.
I know what your situation is ,.	Mo mọ kini ipo rẹ jẹ,.
You have your own way of doing it.	O ni ọna tirẹ lati ṣe.
I think you are trying to make myself better.	Mo ro pe o n gbiyanju lati jẹ ki ara mi dara.
I thought my love affair was over.	Mo ro ero ifẹ mi yọ kuro.
Stay out of my room! 	Duro kuro ni yara mi!
You get all the benefits without any of the downsides.	O gba gbogbo awọn anfani laisi eyikeyi ninu awọn isalẹ.
He saw that he was alone in the house.	O ri pe oun nikan wa ninu ile.
There are educational programs on and off.	Awọn eto ẹkọ wa ati lọ.
I'm sorry.	Ma binu.
Like, a lot.	Bii, pupọ.
He is angry with me.	O binu si mi.
Can't wait to try that.	Ko le duro lati gbiyanju iyẹn.
I do not know anything about it.	Nko mo nkankan nipa re.
I had a really hard time making that jump.	Mo ni akoko lile gaan ni ṣiṣe fo ipari yẹn.
He worked hard in public life.	O ṣiṣẹ pupọ ni igbesi aye gbangba.
He did not come back.	Ko pada wa.
Let’s switch to warm clothes and go out again.	Jẹ ki a yipada si awọn aṣọ ti o gbona ki a tun jade lọ lẹẹkansi.
He placed his other hand on me.	O gbe ọwọ rẹ miiran si mi.
This makes for a beautiful picture.	Eyi ṣe fun aworan ti o lẹwa.
When the energy is absorbed, it becomes hot.	Nigbati agbara ina ba gba, o di ooru.
You have a fixed one.	O ni ọkan ti o wa titi.
We must not let this be the way we continue to walk.	A ko gbọdọ jẹ ki eyi jẹ ọna ti a tẹsiwaju lati rin.
Police have confiscated their car.	Awọn ọlọpa ti gbe ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wọn.
You can find one in any app store.	O le wa ọkan ni eyikeyi ile itaja ohun elo.
They treat everyone.	Wọn tọju gbogbo eniyan.
You’ve heard it all before.	O ti gbọ gbogbo rẹ tẹlẹ.
Have a new girl now.	Ni ọmọbirin tuntun bayi.
Don't worry about anything.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan nipa ohunkohun.
He would be great.	Oun yoo jẹ nla.
You can take me outside too much.	O le mu mi ni ita pupọ.
He is completely in his power.	O wa patapata ni agbara rẹ.
The brothers look at each other.	Awọn arakunrin wo ara wọn.
Let that cook for a while.	Jẹ ki iyẹn ṣe ounjẹ fun igba diẹ.
Essentially, this is where the story begins.	Ni pataki, eyi ni ibi ti itan naa bẹrẹ.
He even returned to the music himself a short time later.	O paapaa pada si orin funrararẹ ni igba diẹ.
And you go through it again.	Ati awọn ti o lọ nipasẹ o lẹẹkansi.
Wonderful teach people.	Iyanu Kọ eniyan.
Be me!	Jẹ mi!
I don’t think you can handle my music.	Emi ko ro pe o le mu orin mi.
This is important to me.	Eyi ṣe pataki fun mi.
This can be good with it.	Eyi le dara pẹlu rẹ.
So it has been used in the past.	Nitorina o ti lo ni igba atijọ.
No, we will not be able to bring it back.	Rara, a kii yoo ni anfani lati mu wa pada.
They have two children, a son and a daughter.	Wọn ni ọmọ meji, ọmọkunrin kan ati ọmọbirin kan.
It makes her laugh.	O mu rẹ rẹrin.
There are other ways.	Awọn ọna miiran wa nibẹ.
And things like that.	Ati awọn nkan bii iyẹn.
It has become.	O ti di.
Please buy the book.	Jọwọ ra iwe naa.
Notice it.	Ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
Read their comments.	Ka ọrọ wọn.
And there was a man.	Ati ọkunrin kan wà.
We have to drop it or let it go.	A ni lati fa rẹ silẹ tabi jẹ ki o lọ.
I have been under a lot of stress lately.	Mo ti wa labẹ wahala pupọ laipẹ.
This is very important.	Eyi ṣe pataki pupọ.
This is said to be a bad thing.	Eyi ni a sọ pe o jẹ ohun buburu.
No worries there.	Ko si wahala nibẹ.
You do this in three main ways.	O ṣe eyi ni awọn ọna pataki mẹta.
To know how to paint their books.	Lati mọ bi o ṣe le kun awọn iwe wọn.
At first, there seemed to be no problem at all.	Ni akọkọ, o dabi pe ko si iṣoro rara.
You also have a lot of time.	O tun ni akoko pupọ.
And it continues to work well.	Ati pe o tẹsiwaju lati ṣiṣẹ daradara.
I notice more.	Mo ṣe akiyesi diẹ sii.
Lots of things to talk about.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan lati sọrọ nipa.
Every word is evil.	Gbogbo ọrọ jẹ ibi.
This song will make your feet move.	Orin yii yoo jẹ ki ẹsẹ rẹ gbe.
Maybe they just left.	Boya wọn kan fi silẹ.
He will not love.	Oun kii yoo nifẹ.
I hope it will.	Mo nireti pe yoo.
I could be wrong. 	Mo le ṣe aṣiṣe. 
The child is not afraid and does not try to separate himself.	Ọmọ naa ko bẹru ko si gbiyanju lati ya ara rẹ kuro.
And put things like that for a while.	Ki o si fi awọn nkan bii iyẹn fun igba diẹ.
And it happened that way.	Ati pe o ṣẹlẹ ni ọna yẹn.
He loves to listen to other people’s opinions.	O nifẹ lati gbọ awọn ero eniyan miiran.
They do not know it exists.	Wọn ko mọ pe o wa.
This is all about what happened the other day.	Eyi jẹ gbogbo nipa ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni ọjọ miiran.
People always want to leave the city.	Awọn eniyan nigbagbogbo fẹ lati lọ kuro ni ilu naa.
Haven't seen you since summer.	Ko tii ri ọ lati igba ooru.
Do not translate word for word.	Ma ṣe tumọ ọrọ si ọrọ.
I have to talk to you.	Mo gbọdọ ba ọ sọrọ.
That means a person.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe eniyan ni.
And it sounds good.	Ati pe o dun wa.
Not sure why we need two of them.	Ko daju idi ti a nilo meji ninu wọn.
You do not want to give in.	O ko fẹ lati fun ni.
And about music.	Ati nipa orin.
The rain continued for several days without rest.	Ojo naa tẹsiwaju fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọjọ laisi isinmi.
He refuses to cook.	O kọ lati ṣe ounjẹ.
The sea takes everything.	Okun gba ohun gbogbo.
But girls do not spend much of their time in it.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọmọbirin ko lo pupọ julọ akoko wọn ninu.
He was the only boy in the room.	Oun nikan ni ọmọkunrin ninu yara naa.
You need help.	O nilo iranlọwọ.
You have to move.	O ni lati gbe.
I can not stand it!	Emi ko le duro rẹ!
Prices are already happening.	Iye owo ti n ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
And remember, it can't last long.	Ati ki o ranti, ko le ṣiṣe ni pipẹ.
How sweet it is.	Bawo ni o ti dun to.
That water will burn if it is hot.	Omi yẹn yoo sun ti o ba gbona.
My father taught me that.	Baba mi kọ mi pe.
I am not him.	Emi kii ṣe oun.
This is not surprising.	Eyi kii ṣe iyalẹnu.
I can't even comment on the phone.	Emi ko le paapaa ṣe alaye lori foonu.
What works for one may not work for another.	Ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ fun ọkan le ma ṣiṣẹ fun miiran.
He looks at the picture of his wife and child.	O wo aworan iyawo ati ọmọ rẹ.
Your dog refuses to enter the house.	Aja rẹ kọ lati wọ ile.
I know that city.	Mo mọ ilu yẹn.
I believe you when you say you saw them.	Mo gba ọ gbọ nigbati o sọ pe o ri wọn.
Use that to your advantage.	Lo iyẹn si anfani rẹ.
To many.	Si ọpọlọpọ awọn.
I think it is everywhere.	Mo ro pe o wa nibi gbogbo.
We forgot to eat.	A gbagbe lati jẹun.
The city is cut off from the outside.	Ilu ti ge kuro ni ita ita.
Everything works fine.	Ohun gbogbo ṣiṣẹ daradara.
However, it is early in the season.	Sibẹsibẹ, o jẹ ni kutukutu akoko.
It is not that we should read too much into this.	Kii ṣe pe o yẹ ki a ka pupọ sinu eyi.
They may have taken over the whole city by now.	Wọn le ti gba gbogbo ilu ni bayi.
There is no time for that now.	Ko si akoko fun iyẹn ni bayi.
Not good.	Ko dara.
Please allow them to be around the room.	Jọwọ gba wọn lati ni ayika yara.
So they know about it.	Nitorina wọn mọ nipa rẹ.
It happened last time.	O ṣẹlẹ ni akoko to kẹhin.
He kept us safe.	O pa wa mọ.
She is doing well.	O n ṣe daradara.
That is not the question.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ibeere naa.
So far, this is the only information we know about them.	Ni bayi, eyi nikan ni alaye ti a mọ nipa wọn.
Which did not!	Eyi ti ko ṣe!
I would like to return to the story you are telling.	Emi yoo fẹ lati pada si itan ti o n sọ.
They are the most important decisions you will make.	Wọn jẹ awọn ipinnu pataki julọ ti iwọ yoo ṣe.
I know what I saw.	Mo mọ ohun ti mo ri.
It just broke completely.	O kan ti fọ patapata.
And this works.	Ati pe eyi ṣiṣẹ.
The problem with that is obvious.	Iṣoro pẹlu iyẹn ni iyẹn han gbangba.
Listen to me, and listen well.	Gbọ mi, ki o si gbọ daradara.
And he himself asked why they did not come to him.	Ara rẹ si beere idi ti wọn ko fi wa fun u.
This house is a place to meet.	Ile yii jẹ aye lati pade.
Find another site that may be of interest to you.	Ri aaye miiran ti o le nifẹ si ọ.
In many places.	Ni aaye pupọ.
Times are hard.	Awọn akoko jẹ lile.
The car sped off.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa sare lọ.
One of them is one.	Ọkan ninu wọn jẹ ọkan.
It makes who you are.	O mu ki ẹni ti o jẹ.
I can not work out what you are doing.	Emi ko le ṣiṣẹ jade ohun ti o n ṣe.
But such a thing is not possible.	Ṣugbọn iru nkan bẹẹ ko ṣeeṣe.
And we did not.	Ati pe a ko ṣe.
None of them are already here.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o wa nibi tẹlẹ.
The boy found his father dead.	Ọmọkunrin naa ri baba rẹ ti o ku.
Pick someone you really love.	Mu ẹnikan ti o ni ife gaan.
Some people say it is part of the thing.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan sọ pe ara ohun ni.
I think he will buy breakfast for you.	Mo ro pe oun yoo ra ounjẹ owurọ fun ọ.
They cannot stop them.	Wọn ko le da wọn duro.
They belong to her mother and are very small.	Wọn jẹ ti iya rẹ ati pe o kere pupọ.
I never met him.	Emi ko ba pade rẹ rara.
In the area.	Ni agbegbe.
It's fast.	O yara.
We are together every day.	A wa papọ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
This makes me want to go back and read this book.	Eyi jẹ ki n fẹ pada ki o ka iwe yii.
He would stand back and say it was over.	Oun yoo duro sẹhin yoo sọ pe o ti pari.
The station is coming.	Ibudo naa n bọ.
May at first just feel a little down.	Le ni akọkọ kan rilara kekere kan si isalẹ.
These have to be bad people.	Awọn wọnyi ni lati jẹ eniyan buburu.
He has not heard for a while.	Ko tii gbọ ni igba diẹ.
But even that is not enough.	Ṣugbọn paapaa iyẹn ko to.
And that is important to understand.	Ati pe iyẹn ṣe pataki lati ni oye.
There is no body to do such a thing.	Ko si ara lati ṣe iru nkan bayi.
He said he seemed scared and angry.	O sọ pe o dabi ẹni pe o bẹru ati binu.
It is an excellent location.	O jẹ ipo ti o dara julọ.
He walks with determination.	O rin pẹlu ipinnu.
Do what you can to find the other two out.	Ṣe ohun ti o le lati ri awọn meji miiran jade.
Never seen such a thing before.	Ko ri iru eyi tẹlẹ.
And, we had a good time.	Ati pe, a ni akoko ti o dara.
But, of course, you have to go.	Ṣugbọn, dajudaju, o ni lati lọ.
It was the best day of my entire life.	Ọjọ ti o dara julọ ni gbogbo igbesi aye mi.
I said it was very likely that it was a mistake.	Mo sọ pe o ṣee ṣe pupọ pe o jẹ aṣiṣe.
You just have to wait a while.	O kan ni lati duro nigba miiran.
No time for a minute.	Ko si akoko fun iṣẹju kan.
O pa a, same.	O pa a, kanna.
Go for it.	Lọ fun o.
This is just a beautiful book to play.	Eleyi jẹ o kan kan lẹwa iwe lati mu.
He was from another summer family.	O si wà lati miiran ooru ebi.
It looks like something is up.	O dabi pe ohun kan wa soke.
He has no room to go.	Ko ni yara lọ.
The project took two weeks to complete.	Iṣẹ naa gba ọsẹ meji lati pari.
And they are, for a while.	Ati pe wọn wa, fun igba diẹ.
I am reading a book you are interested in.	Mo n ka iwe ti o nifẹ si.
His sister and friend agreed to return.	Arabinrin rẹ ati ọrẹ rẹ gba lati pada.
This is news.	Eleyi je awon iroyin.
This is a cat.	Eyi jẹ ologbo.
I have not thought much.	Mo ti ko ro ọpọlọpọ.
Others see it.	Awọn miiran wo rẹ.
His mother worried that he would lose the job.	Iya rẹ ṣe aniyan pe oun yoo padanu iṣẹ naa.
You have nothing to live for.	O ko si ohun to ngbe.
That was his first two months in office.	Iyẹn jẹ oṣu meji akọkọ rẹ ni ọfiisi.
Future terms.	Awọn ọrọ iwaju.
John finds his pockets for his keys.	John wa awọn apo rẹ fun awọn bọtini rẹ.
No and no.	Ko ni ati ki o ko.
Before it was a law office.	Ṣaaju pe o jẹ ọfiisi ofin kan.
One thing is for sure.	Ohun kan daju.
Lives depend on that.	Awọn igbesi aye da lori iyẹn.
I just want to see.	Mo kan fẹ lati rii.
Take my picture before you go.	Ya aworan mi ṣaaju ki o to lọ.
Your car, no.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ, rara.
That means a lot.	Iyẹn tumọ si pupọ.
I look out.	Mo wo jade.
I am not too much for running.	Emi ko jẹ pupọ fun ṣiṣe.
By my phone.	Nipa foonu mi.
They seem to be swimming in some kind of water.	Wọn dabi ẹni pe wọn n we ninu iru omi kan.
He rolled his eyes, angry.	O fa oju rẹ kuro, o binu.
Anyone can speak or write.	Ẹnikẹni le sọrọ tabi kọ.
I want to think of the day you were born.	Mo fẹ lati ro ọjọ ti a bi ọ.
I have a lot of books here.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe nibi.
I kept that energy.	Mo pa agbara naa mọ.
You can stay down here if you want.	O le duro si isalẹ nibi ti o ba fẹ.
He never wrote a bad song.	Ko kọ orin buburu kan lailai.
I want to paint my room.	Mo fe kun yara mi.
I stopped them on purpose.	Mo da wọn duro lori idi.
He thought it was something.	O ro o je nkankan.
Or do you do any other like it.	Tabi ki iwọ ki o ṣe eyikeyi miiran bi o .
We will not accept this.	A ko ni gba eleyi.
That tells him.	Iyẹn n sọ fun u.
Find a place.	Wa ibi kan wa.
Here is what you will do.	Eyi ni ohun ti iwọ yoo ṣe.
Please do not do this.	Jọwọ maṣe ṣe eyi.
We walked outside in the hot summer sun.	A rin ita ni oorun ooru.
I've seen that kind of late.	Mo ti ri iru ti pẹ.
There is a boy here who looks like you.	Ọmọkunrin kan wa nibi ti o dabi iwọ.
The future, not the world.	Ojo iwaju, kii ṣe aye.
This is not your concern.	Eyi kii ṣe aniyan rẹ.
To date, he has not changed his game rules.	Titi di alẹ oni, ko kan yi awọn ofin ere pada.
Do you feel now?	Ṣe o lero bayi?
This becomes a problem.	Eyi di iṣoro.
There are several reasons for this to be expected.	Awọn idi pupọ lo wa ti eyi le nireti.
Okay, don’t be hard on yourself.	O dara, maṣe jẹ lile lori ara rẹ.
At least my sister would have been happy.	O kere ju arabinrin mi yoo ti dun.
He got angry and left the meeting.	O binu o si fi ipade naa silẹ.
Most people fear it.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan bẹru rẹ.
But it did not continue.	Ṣugbọn ko tẹsiwaju.
He spent his life trying to make things better.	O si lo aye re gbiyanju lati mu aye dara ohun.
Finish as much as you can.	Pari bi o ti le ṣe.
It's a good job.	Ise to dara ni.
Or you can make your own.	Tabi o le ṣe ti ara rẹ.
A group of men.	Ẹgbẹ kan ti awọn ọkunrin.
It’s something to do.	O jẹ nkan lati ṣe.
Let us not worry now.	Jẹ ki a ma ṣe aniyan ni bayi.
The first thing to learn.	Ohun akọkọ lati kọ ẹkọ.
You have to be the one to make the decision.	O gbọdọ jẹ ẹniti o ṣe ipinnu.
I will not let them take your sister too.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki wọn gba arabinrin rẹ pẹlu.
He can not walk.	Ko le rin.
Sometimes they would sit together, that’s all.	Nigba miiran wọn yoo joko papọ, iyẹn ni gbogbo rẹ.
If so, that's fine.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, dara.
That is my job.	Iṣẹ́ mi niyẹn.
With it it is all personal.	Pẹlu rẹ o jẹ gbogbo ti ara ẹni.
So people go out there and go out at night.	Nitorina awọn eniyan n lọ kuro nibẹ ti wọn si jade ni alẹ.
All books have to be in good condition.	Gbogbo awọn iwe ni lati wa ni ipo ti o dara.
To let your child hear you need to notice them.	Lati jẹ ki ọmọ rẹ gbọ ọ o nilo lati ni akiyesi wọn.
And it did not do a very good job.	Ati pe ko ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara pupọ.
But if you leave now, you will end up with nothing.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba lọ kuro ni bayi, iwọ yoo pari pẹlu ohunkohun.
It will reach you.	Yoo de ọdọ rẹ.
One of their teachers is very.	Ọkan ninu awọn olukọ wọn jẹ gidigidi.
Just stay home.	O kan duro ni ile.
Some children are not allowed to go.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọde ko gba laaye lati lọ.
Anything will be better than that.	Ohunkohun yoo dara ju eyi lọ.
Which you have already heard.	Eyi ti o ti gbọ tẹlẹ.
Everyone is out.	Gbogbo eniyan ti jade.
You can not say no.	O ko le sọ rara.
I do not want to do it now.	Emi ko fẹ lati ṣe ni bayi.
It comes in handy.	O wa ni ọwọ.
Others may just pass.	Awọn miiran le kan kọja.
Please get help.	Jọwọ gba iranlọwọ.
So they completely lost it from sight.	Nitorina wọn padanu rẹ patapata lati oju.
Words, in most cases, are not enough.	Awọn ọrọ, ni ọpọlọpọ igba, ko to.
You enjoy being surrounded by beautiful things.	O gbadun ni ayika nipasẹ awọn ohun lẹwa.
I do not like to do this.	Emi ko nifẹ lati ṣe eyi.
They can not find their way.	Wọn ko le wa ọna wọn.
Nothing special, that you can see.	Ko si ohun to pataki, wipe o le ri.
He did not say what happened.	Ko sọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
There is a small fire.	Ina kekere kan wa.
He was forced to do this.	O fi agbara mu lati ṣe eyi.
He will only talk to me, right now.	Oun yoo ba mi sọrọ nikan, ni bayi.

There is not much to it.	Nibẹ ni ko Elo si o.
I don't like myself.	Emi ko fẹran ara mi.
Neither of them said anything.	Bẹni ninu wọn ko sọ ohunkohun.
But he also did not speak.	Ṣugbọn oun naa ko sọrọ.
But it could not happen.	Ṣugbọn ko le ṣẹlẹ.
If you think about it, this is the only understanding.	Ti o ba ronu nipa rẹ, eyi jẹ oye nikan.
You can't see my face.	O ko le ri oju mi.
I hate myself.	Mo korira ara mi.
I have decided not to drive.	Mo ti pinnu lati ma wakọ.
To you, to me, to everyone here.	Si ọ, si mi, si gbogbo eniyan nibi.
That is not the reality of your life.	Iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ ti igbesi aye rẹ.
Have you decided where to go this year?	Njẹ o ti pinnu ibi ti o lọ ni ọdun yii?
Game over, man.	Ere pari, eniyan.
He did everything in his own time.	O ṣe ohun gbogbo ni akoko tirẹ.
No, you did not stop here.	Rara, o ko duro nibi.
Today is a great day.	Oni je ojo nla.
Not everything is everywhere.	Ohun gbogbo ko da nibi gbogbo.
They do what people want.	Wọn ṣe ohun ti eniyan fẹ.
No worries.	Ko si wahala.
I have no power.	Nko ni agbara kankan.
I do not know who he is.	Emi ko mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
It may be life away from now.	O le jẹ aye kuro ni bayi.
Great way to get there and back.	Ọna ti o dara julọ lati wa nibẹ ati pada.
And maybe the day after.	Ati boya ọjọ lẹhin.
This book really talks to parents.	Iwe yi gan sọrọ si awọn obi.
Maybe a lot of them.	Boya ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn.
But would be nice with two of us.	Ṣugbọn yoo dara pẹlu meji ninu wa.
I hope this bag doesn’t turn out to be the same thing.	Mo nireti pe apo yii kii yoo jade lati jẹ ohun kanna.
I have to take these to the police.	Mo gbọdọ mu awọn wọnyi fun ọlọpa.
And that's better than anything anyone else does.	Ati pe iyẹn dara ju ohunkohun ti ẹnikẹni miiran ṣe.
I look and look everywhere, but nothing.	Mo wo ati ki o wo nibi gbogbo, sugbon ti ohunkohun ko.
Now is the time to plan.	Bayi ni akoko lati gbero.
But his heart was very fast.	Ṣugbọn ọkan rẹ yara pupọ.
It didn’t happen to him to not.	O ko ṣẹlẹ si i lati ko.
But this is the face.	Ṣugbọn eyi ni oju.
Go see.	Lọ wo.
So that their position can.	Ki ipo wọn le.
You have seen these many times before.	O ti rii awọn wọnyi ni ọpọlọpọ igba tẹlẹ.
He wanted to change, but did not think he could.	O fẹ lati yipada, ṣugbọn ko ro pe o le.
All this takes time.	Gbogbo eyi gba akoko.
For the time being.	Fun akoko naa.
They had stayed in the house.	Wọn ti duro ni ile naa.
There is no one in our house.	Ko si ẹnikan ninu ile wa.
The law was put in place.	A fi ofin de ibi.
But it will not open for him.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo ṣii fun u.
You are good too.	Iwọ naa dara.
I hate that song.	Mo korira orin yẹn.
Enter the room.	Wọ yara naa.
They hate it.	Wọn korira rẹ.
We took this.	A mu eyi.
What are you trying to find.	Kini o n gbiyanju lati wa.
I am not a mother with them.	Emi kii ṣe iya pẹlu wọn.
I do not think it is right.	Emi ko ro pe o tọ.
But maybe not as hard as it seems.	Ṣugbọn boya kii ṣe lile bi o ṣe dabi.
It is a system problem.	O jẹ iṣoro eto.
You have to laugh.	O ni lati rẹrin.
I can't wait for him.	Emi ko le duro fun u.
Both sides are wrong.	Awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji jẹ aṣiṣe.
It is possible in most cases.	O ṣee ṣe ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
And yet, he could not let go.	Ati sibẹsibẹ, ko le jẹ ki o lọ.
That's not right.	Iyẹn ko tọ.
You will have to work for it.	Iwọ yoo ni lati ṣiṣẹ fun rẹ.
It is also in the store.	O tun wa ninu ile itaja.
And it was the first.	Ati pe o jẹ akọkọ.
He did not know what to say.	Ko mọ ohun ti yoo sọ.
Know that this is the time to give.	Mọ pe eyi ni akoko lati fun.
It should be done in young children.	O yẹ ki o ṣe ni awọn ọmọde ọdọ.
It makes sense.	O ṣe oye to.
And it could be wrong.	Ati pe o le jẹ aṣiṣe.
Hands can be the best word for us.	Ọwọ le jẹ ọrọ ti o dara julọ fun wa.
High people take up more space because they take up more space.	Awọn eniyan giga gba aaye diẹ sii nitori wọn gba aaye diẹ sii.
I put the stuff in your box.	Mo fi nkan naa sinu apoti rẹ.
I was not feeling well that night.	Ara mi ko dara rara ni alẹ yẹn.
I am nothing and no one.	Emi ko jẹ nkankan ati pe ko si ẹnikan.
If that is the question.	Ti o ba jẹ ibeere naa.
Books are our friend.	Awọn iwe jẹ ọrẹ wa.
I'm sorry we cut it.	Mo binu pe a ge kuro.
This seems impossible.	Eyi dabi pe ko ṣee ṣe.
It explains things.	O ṣe alaye awọn nkan.
The brother was always hurt.	Arakunrin naa jẹ ipalara nigbagbogbo.
I believe people mean well.	Mo gbagbọ pe awọn eniyan tumọ si daradara.
I waited a long time.	Mo duro gun.
My how times have changed.	Mi bawo ni awọn akoko ti yipada.
This was about three times too.	Eleyi je nipa igba mẹta ju.
I'm still talking, but you don't hear me anymore.	Mo tun n sọrọ, ṣugbọn iwọ ko gbọ mi mọ.
Know.	Mọ.
This is not the way it should be.	Eyi kii ṣe ọna ti o yẹ ki o jẹ.
But they should not be.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko yẹ ki o jẹ.
I picked it up and drank it.	Mo gbe e, mo si mu.
Everyone has to go.	Gbogbo eniyan ni lati lọ.
I'll take care of it.	Emi yoo tọju rẹ.
They can help with two things.	Wọn le ṣe iranlọwọ pẹlu awọn nkan meji.
He began to walk away.	O bẹrẹ si rin kuro.
Up will be below.	Soke yoo wa ni isalẹ.
But that will never happen again.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
If it's too late, it's too late.	Ti o ba pẹ, o ti pẹ.
You must do what you must.	O gbọdọ ṣe ohun ti o gbọdọ.
The brother stared into the room.	Arakunrin ti o wo oju wo inu yara naa.
They are the best thing in my life.	Wọn jẹ ohun ti o dara julọ ni igbesi aye mi.
I want to stay in the profession.	Mo fẹ lati duro ninu iṣẹ naa.
Other students did not notice.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe miiran ko ṣe akiyesi.
Move it around.	Gbe e ni ayika.
There are three ways to do this.	Awọn ọna mẹta lo wa lati ṣe bẹ.
I try not to notice it.	Mo gbiyanju lati ma ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
I would never have known how important the baby was.	Emi kii yoo ti mọ bi ọmọ naa ṣe pataki to.
We don't know enough about what's going on.	A ko mọ to nipa ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
You can not make up.	O ko le ṣe soke.
Well done.	Daradara a ṣe.
They want to do things for themselves.	Wọn fẹ lati ṣe awọn nkan fun ara wọn.
He got up to leave.	O dide lati lọ kuro.
And we can even make a statement in it.	Ati pe a le paapaa ṣe alaye kan ninu rẹ.
You know how to do a lot.	O mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe pupọ.
Maybe I started it.	Boya emi ni o bẹrẹ.
I went back and talked to him.	Mo pada ki o si ba a sọrọ.
But we think these are appropriate.	Ṣugbọn a ro pe awọn wọnyi yẹ.
I was told that it was quite out of the question.	Mo ti so fun wipe o je ohun jade ti awọn ibeere.
Lunch on me.	Ounjẹ ọsan lori mi.
The minute you took the surprise away, there was no picture.	Ni iṣẹju ti o mu iyalẹnu naa kuro, ko si aworan.
He walks in on us.	O rin ni lori wa.
It was the thoughts away.	O ti awọn ero kuro.
Not only for me but my family as well.	Kii ṣe fun emi nikan ṣugbọn idile mi pẹlu.
If they know really, really well.	Ti wọn mọ gaan, gaan daradara.
I know my son, he didn’t think about that.	Mo mọ ọmọ mi, ko ronu nipa iyẹn.
After a few minutes the police car picked up.	Lẹhin iṣẹju diẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ọlọpa gbe soke.
We need to use less water.	A nilo lati lo omi kekere.
And let me tell you.	Ati jẹ ki n sọ ọ.
Machine than anything else.	Ẹrọ ju ohunkohun miiran.
I don’t want to do all that hard for you.	Emi ko fẹ lati ṣe gbogbo iyẹn le fun ọ.
This is my favorite time of the year.	Eyi ni akoko ayanfẹ mi ti ọdun.
I will leave.	Emi yoo lọ kuro.
But he did not know, so he did not spend time.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe mọ, nitorina ko lo akoko.
And again and again and again.	Ati lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
It takes human wisdom.	O nilo awọn ọgbọn eniyan.
I think that was the way to eat me again.	Mo ro pe iyẹn ni ọna lati jẹ mi lẹẹkansi.
It is important to eat.	O jẹ pataki lati jẹun.
Let me ask you a question.	Jẹ ki n beere ibeere kan fun ọ.
He has been here ever since.	O ti wa nibi lati igba naa.
A pade ni opopona.	A pade ni opopona.
We sell them but they are a little more expensive.	A ta wọn ṣugbọn wọn jẹ diẹ diẹ sii.
You can use me to find it.	O le lo mi lati wa a.
You just say you do.	Iwọ nikan kan sọ pe o ṣe.
The world is getting hot.	Aye n gbona.
They just can't get enough.	Wọn kan ko le gba to.
This year, everything changed.	Ni ọdun yii, ohun gbogbo yipada.
I continue, asking your question after question.	Mo tẹsiwaju, n beere ibeere rẹ lẹhin ibeere.
It was over for him and he knew.	O ti pari fun u ati pe o mọ.
But they can say something.	Ṣugbọn wọn le sọ nkankan.
Some people do not think about it.	Awọn eniyan kan ko ronu nipa rẹ.
But it is not so.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ.
Your phone starts ringing.	Foonu rẹ bẹrẹ si ohun orin.
You know what to expect.	O mọ kini lati reti.
I just want to let you know.	Mo kan fẹ lati jẹ ki o mọ.
He writes for pictures.	O kọ fun awọn aworan.
Which you can.	Eyi ti o le.
I will do it.	Emi yoo ṣe.
Many of us expect and wait for things to go wrong.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ti wa reti ati ki o duro fun ohun ti lọ ti ko tọ.
Not just say what the man can do.	Ko kan sọ ohun ti ọkunrin naa le ṣe.
It's just so good.	O kan dara pupọ.
A woman driving.	Obinrin kan ti n wakọ.
It is one of them.	Ọkan ninu wọn ni.
It must have been about his age.	Yoo ti jẹ nipa ọjọ ori rẹ.
All you have to do is wait.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ni lati ṣe ni duro.
That is not easy.	Ko rọrun yẹn.
This can not be done.	Eyi ko le ṣe.
It seemed a little stronger.	O dabi enipe diẹ ni okun sii.
Always fast when crossing the road.	Nigbagbogbo yara nigbati o ba n kọja ni opopona.
I want to be on this.	Mo fẹ lati wa lori eyi.
That’s not more money going to everyone.	Iyẹn kii ṣe owo diẹ sii ti o lọ si gbogbo eniyan.
I just can't beat him.	Mo kan ko le lu u.
She called this her daughter.	O pe eyi ni ọmọbirin rẹ.
The sister did not know what she was looking at.	Arabinrin naa ko mọ ohun ti o n wo.
You need a plan to do this.	O nilo eto lati ṣe eyi.
And location.	Ati ipo.
You know me now.	O mọ mi ni bayi.
It started with us.	O bẹrẹ pẹlu wa.
They work hard.	Wọn ṣiṣẹ le.
You know they deserve to be there for you.	O mọ pe wọn yẹ lati wa nibẹ fun ọ.
I am happy.	Inu mi dun.
Go to the store and buy more food.	Lọ si ile itaja ati ra ounjẹ diẹ sii.
But of course we don't want it to stop anymore.	Ṣugbọn dajudaju a ko fẹ ki o duro mọ.
This cannot be an accident.	Eyi ko le jẹ ijamba.
You get what you insert.	O gba ohun ti o fi sii.
But still possible.	Sugbon si tun ṣee ṣe.
It would never have happened to me at all.	Kii yoo ti ṣẹlẹ si mi rara.
Is it worth it ?.	Ṣe o tọ si?.
She feared he would almost hurt her.	O bẹru pe oun yoo fẹrẹ ṣe ipalara fun u.
He learned most at night.	O kọ julọ ni alẹ.
I have been off his path for a while.	Mo ti ya kuro ni ọna rẹ fun igba diẹ.
Stores, up to a point.	Awọn ile itaja, titi de aaye kan.
She took the time to talk to her students.	O gba akoko lati ba awọn ọmọ ile-iwe rẹ sọrọ.
Only time will tell.	Nikan akoko yoo so fun.
The whole program is here.	Gbogbo eto wa nibi.
Maybe you also believe it can change.	Boya o tun gbagbọ pe o le yipada.
Or think you do.	Tabi ro pe o ṣe.
Some people don’t.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ko.
Okay, he'll take care of it for her, the man said.	O dara, yoo tọju rẹ fun u, ọkunrin naa sọ.
We should not always look inside.	Ki a ma ma wo inu nigbagbogbo.
Tell us that we can do things ourselves.	Sọ fun wa pe a le ṣe awọn nkan funrararẹ.
Too late.	O ti pẹ ju.
I just do not know.	Mo kan ko mọ.
The doctors gave him three months to live.	Awọn dokita fun u ni oṣu mẹta lati wa laaye.
His father gave him money, and he took it away.	Baba rẹ fun u owo, o si mu kuro.
I still can't say what that thing is.	Emi ko tun le sọ kini nkan naa jẹ.
This may not last long.	Eyi le ma pẹ.
Stay on this beach.	Duro si okun yi.
Let us go and ask him.	Jẹ ki a lọ beere lọwọ rẹ.
You can come.	O le wa.
The fact that it does not matter.	Otitọ pe ko ṣe pataki.
But if we hurry, we do not need to.	Ṣugbọn ti a ba yara, a ko nilo lati.
It is not the first time, and it will not be the last.	Kii ṣe igba akọkọ, ati pe kii yoo jẹ ikẹhin.
We are not children anymore.	A kii ṣe ọmọde mọ.
Stop working too much, okay.	Duro ṣiṣe pupọ, o dara.
They pull away.	Wọn fa kuro.
Send them home.	Fi wọn ranṣẹ si ile.
Used to be a policeman a long time ago.	Lo lati jẹ ọlọpa ni igba pipẹ sẹhin.
Morning rest is amazing.	Isinmi owurọ jẹ iyalẹnu.
No one here.	Ko si ẹnikan nibi.
It completely changed the way we worked together.	O yipada patapata bi a ṣe n ṣiṣẹ papọ.
All other points are zero.	Gbogbo awọn aaye miiran jẹ odo.
You need to think more to your plan.	O nilo lati ronu diẹ sii si eto rẹ.
You have what most people wish they could be.	Iwọ ni ohun ti ọpọlọpọ eniyan fẹ pe wọn le jẹ.
We may not be in more time.	A le ma wa ni akoko diẹ sii.
He carried it well.	O gbe e daradara.
You never know when you might need them.	O ko mọ igba ti o le nilo wọn.
I could not have died.	Emi ko le ti ku.
Who knows what they will bring.	Tani o mọ ohun ti wọn yoo mu.
It is our first time, but we will come back.	O jẹ igba akọkọ wa, ṣugbọn a yoo pada wa.
Children learn best when they are able to attend.	Awọn ọmọde kọ ẹkọ dara julọ nigbati wọn ba ni anfani lati lọ.
You may have two in your face sometimes.	O le ni meji ni oju rẹ nigba miiran.
And that's how it works.	Ati awọn ti o ni bi o ti ṣiṣẹ.
Love it and hate it.	Nifẹ rẹ o si korira rẹ.
The key issue, however, is the same.	Ọrọ pataki, sibẹsibẹ, jẹ kanna.
Wait for those.	Duro fun awon.
I think we agree on that.	Mo ro pe a gba lori iyẹn.
This may be the first.	Eyi le jẹ akọkọ.
He was the youngest member of the family.	O jẹ ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti o kere julọ ninu ile naa.
Others hesitate.	Awọn miiran ṣiyemeji.
What a beautiful morning!	Bawo ni owurọ ti lẹwa!
He is beautiful.	O si jẹ lẹwa.
You can believe.	O le gbagbọ.
I am not the only person missing.	Emi kii ṣe eniyan nikan ti o padanu.
I can't even move.	Emi ko le paapaa gbe.
Not on a high mountain.	Ko si lori oke giga.
He loves it.	O nifẹ rẹ.
Stress is not new news.	Wahala kii ṣe awọn iroyin tuntun.
The question has been accepted.	Ti gba ibeere naa.
One will not accept them for brother and sister.	Ọkan yoo ko gba wọn fun arakunrin ati arabinrin.
But that is not the test here.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe idanwo nibi.
Have you met her yet?	Njẹ o ti pade rẹ sibẹsibẹ?
Maybe fast in places.	Boya sare ni awọn aaye.
We will get more information about this problem.	A yoo gba alaye diẹ sii nipa iṣoro yii.
The reason given is incomprehensible.	Idi ti a fun ko ni oye.
They have a lot of questions.	Wọn ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere.
He will not accept!	Oun yoo ko gba!
I give him a head up.	Mo fun u ni ori soke.
Take some time with him.	Gba akoko diẹ pẹlu rẹ.
She was always happy.	Inu rẹ nigbagbogbo dun.
Summer met his face.	Ooru pade oju rẹ.
He didn’t really do any of the testing.	Ko ṣe eyikeyi ninu idanwo naa ni otitọ.
It does not require you to do much of anything, in fact.	Ko beere lọwọ rẹ lati ṣe pupọ ti ohunkohun, ni otitọ.
And out of range with it.	O si jade lori ibiti o pẹlu ti o.
But before that, nothing.	Ṣugbọn ṣaaju iyẹn, ko si nkankan.
He walked over to the street.	O rin lori si ita.
I hope they try again.	Mo nireti pe wọn tun gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
Because inside is where it will be seen now.	Nitori inu ni ibi ti yoo ti ri ni bayi.
We did not go.	A ko lọ.
It has been a difficult winter.	O ti jẹ igba otutu ti o nira.
I just need to say that publicly.	Mo kan nilo lati sọ iyẹn ni gbangba.
It has given you an amazing world.	O ti fun ọ ni aye iyalẹnu.
He left the room for a while.	O fi yara silẹ fun igba diẹ.
No one did anything.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe ohunkohun.
Well not everyone but that is not the point.	O dara kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe aaye naa.
But there must be other information.	Ṣugbọn alaye miiran gbọdọ wa.
Very good.	O dara gaan.
I have something to tell you.	Mo ni nkankan lati so fun o.
At this point we entered.	Ni aaye yii ti a wọ.
I enjoy getting to know you better.	Mo gbadun lati mọ ọ daradara.
Not there this morning.	Ko si nibẹ ni owurọ yi.
That is two questions.	Ibeere meji niyen.
They can’t get any lower.	Wọn ko le gba eyikeyi kekere.
They have to work.	Wọn ni lati ṣiṣẹ.
They will be eating tomorrow.	Wọn yoo jẹ ni ọla.
The doors open.	Awọn ilẹkun ṣii.
Here is the story someone got to do that.	Eyi ni itan ti ẹnikan gba lati ṣe iyẹn.
We will bring more details when they are available.	A yoo mu awọn alaye diẹ sii wa nigbati wọn ba wa.
Across the board.	Kọja awọn ọkọ.
We ate a big one.	A jẹun nla kan.
The years have been over.	Awọn ọdun ti le lori rẹ.
We should just keep our heads down.	A yẹ ki o kan pa ori wa silẹ.
It opened to a selling house.	O ṣii si ile ti o ta.
But that did not last long.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko pẹ pupọ.
But they arrested me.	Ṣugbọn wọn mu mi lọwọ.
Children do such things all the time.	Awọn ọmọde ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ ni gbogbo igba.
Search everywhere to find the missing key.	Wa nibi gbogbo lati wa bọtini ti o padanu.
We are not children.	A kii ṣe ọmọ.
You must try to understand.	O gbọdọ gbiyanju lati ni oye.
It seems impossible.	O dabi pe ko ṣee ṣe.
I was so out of here.	Mo ti wà bẹ jade ti nibi.
Remove from heat.	Yọ kuro ninu ooru.
But neither has grown.	Ṣugbọn bẹni ko ti dagba.
The police are looking for that man.	Awọn ọlọpa n wa ọkunrin yẹn.
It is the law.	Ofin ni.
Lots of work.	Ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ.
It would be.	Yoo jẹ.
Do not forget the problems!	Maṣe gbagbe awọn iṣoro naa!
Whatever this dog wanted, it was yours.	Ohunkohun ti yi aja fe, o je rẹ.
It has nothing to do with understanding.	Ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu oye.
Do just that you want to know.	Ṣe o kan pe o fẹ lati mọ.
Maybe you are sleeping now.	Boya o ti n sun bayi.
That’s good news, of course it is.	Iyẹn jẹ iroyin ti o dara, dajudaju o jẹ.
It’s not just about money.	Kii ṣe nipa owo nikan.
Things like that are not in a book.	Awọn nkan bii iyẹn ko wa ninu iwe kan.
See what you write.	Wo ohun ti o kọ.
What you are looking for you will not find.	Ohun ti o n wa o ko ni ri.
Not much to say.	Ko ni pupo lati sọ.
They expect a lot more.	Wọn nireti pupọ diẹ sii.
Before he could take the woman he could not reach her.	Ṣaaju ki o to le mu obinrin naa ko le de ọdọ rẹ.
Make me better.	Ṣe mi dara.
I need to clean my room.	Mo ni lati nu yara mi.
But back to tea.	Sugbon pada si tii.
Just come.	O kan wa.
Maybe the device can work outside.	Boya ẹrọ le ṣiṣẹ ni ita.
Throw yourself into the sea.	Sọ ara rẹ sinu okun.
But accept this.	Ṣugbọn gba eyi.
You want to, but I don't really know what that will look like.	O fẹ, ṣugbọn Emi ko mọ gaan kini iyẹn yoo dabi.
No members here.	Ko si ẹgbẹ nibi.
People will not stop it.	Awọn eniyan ko ni da a si.
They will use it.	Wọn yoo lo o.
Not yourself.	Kii ṣe funrararẹ.
I'm not feeling well at all.	Emi ko tii rilara dara rara.
As friends.	Bi awọn ọrẹ.
We will return to the city.	A yoo pada si ilu.
When is it.	Nigbawo ni o.
Students believe every word you say.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe gba gbogbo ọrọ ti o sọ gbọ.
A value, not a thing.	Iye kan, kii ṣe ohun kan.
I believe you have something very interesting to tell me.	Mo gbagbọ pe o ni awọn nkan ti o nifẹ pupọ lati sọ fun mi.
He began to get angry.	O bẹrẹ si binu.
I can see that happening.	Mo le rii pe n ṣẹlẹ.
She soon gave birth to her first child.	Laipẹ o ti bi ọmọ akọkọ rẹ.
If you think the price is going down, you sell a contract.	Ti o ba ro pe iye naa n lọ silẹ, o ta adehun kan.
And he never went to his room.	Ati pe ko lọ si yara rẹ.
I believe it is possible.	Mo gbagbọ pe o ṣee ṣe.
No one.	Ko si ọkan.
They start a conversation.	Wọn bẹrẹ ọrọ kan.
What do you see, now?	Kini o ri, ni bayi?
I tried a few.	Mo gbiyanju kan diẹ.
He loves his company.	O nifẹ ile-iṣẹ rẹ.
Lots of broken things around him.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan ti o fọ ni ayika rẹ.
It was like a meeting.	O dabi ipade kan.
Any problems let us know !.	Eyikeyi iṣoro jẹ ki a mọ!.
We are boy and friend.	A jẹ ọmọkunrin ati ọrẹ.
They don’t need much energy right now.	Wọn ko nilo agbara pupọ ni bayi.
You need a friend.	O nilo ọrẹ kan.
But he did not.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe bẹni.
But this time, at this point, he was happy.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yii, ni ibi yii, o dun.
Thus, it is not the only advice.	Bayi, kii ṣe imọran nikan.
They are.	Wọn jẹ.
It makes me happy.	O mu inu mi dun.
But we cannot kill them.	Ṣugbọn a ko le pa wọn.
It comes through in the end.	O wa nipasẹ ni ipari.
He left the phone on his bed.	O fi foonu silẹ lori ibusun rẹ.
In the morning there was money to make.	Ni owurọ o wa owo lati ṣe.
There can be no question.	Ko si ibeere ti o le jẹ.
Turn off the light when done.	Pa ina nigbati o ba ti pari.
I told them this would not be a problem.	Mo sọ fun wọn pe eyi kii yoo jẹ iṣoro.
It may or may not be present.	O le tabi ko le wa rara.
You'll get over it, or you won't.	O yoo gba lori o, tabi o yoo ko.
Music determines your path.	Orin ni o pinnu ọna rẹ.
He stood on.	O si duro lori.
It should not happen here.	Ko yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ nibi.
They live together.	Wọn gbe papọ.
I was pretty good about that.	Mo ti a ti lẹwa ti o dara nipa ti.
You have so much money there is nothing to do.	O ni owo pupọ ko si nkankan lati ṣe.
I closed the door in his face.	Mo ti ilẹkun ni oju rẹ.
It’s always fun.	O nigbagbogbo dun.
So it was there.	Nitorina o wa nibẹ.
The heat was like a cold, and the temperature was too high for him.	Ooru ba a bi otutu, ati otutu si jẹ fun u bi ooru.
We are out.	A ti jade.
But they are gone now.	Ṣugbọn wọn ti lọ ni bayi.
The metal will do you good.	Irin naa yoo ṣe ọ dara.
Remember to always remember.	Ranti pe ki o ranti nigbagbogbo.
It is a question of rules.	O jẹ ibeere ti awọn ofin.
It's not like that.	Ko dabi rẹ.
I want us to have more.	Mo fẹ ki a ni diẹ sii.
Very good can stay there forever.	O dara pupọ le duro nibẹ lailai.
They don’t want that.	Wọn ko fẹ iyẹn.
Many of these stories have been written.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn itan wọnyi ti a ti kọ.
My wife always tells me not to keep it there.	Iyawo mi nigbagbogbo n sọ fun mi pe ki n ma tọju rẹ nibẹ.
Some make their name.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣe orukọ wọn.
Everyone has to die one day.	Gbogbo eniyan ni lati ku ni ọjọ kan.
None of this worked as intended.	Ko si eyi ti o ṣiṣẹ bi a ti pinnu.
No way, no way.	Ko si ọna, ko si ọna.
He just doesn’t seem to want to agree with my plan.	O kan dabi pe ko fẹ lati gba pẹlu eto mi.
He is very hopeful.	O nireti pupọ.
They can drink.	Wọn le mu.
He placed the plane key on the table.	O gbe bọtini ọkọ ofurufu ni tabili.
It makes your eyes water.	O jẹ ki oju rẹ di omi.
You do not need to know now.	O ko nilo lati mọ ni bayi.
His father was born.	A bi baba rẹ.
It is true.	O ti wa ni otitọ.
You can eat both.	O le jẹ awọn mejeeji.
Many of these men are even there.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkunrin wọnyi wa nibẹ paapaa.
That is not your way at all.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ọna rẹ rara.
I told them my son was with us, but they did not listen.	Mo sọ fun wọn pe ọmọkunrin mi wa pẹlu wa, ṣugbọn wọn ko gbọ.
It has nothing to do with art at all.	Ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu aworan rara.
However, the truth of the matter is, some will.	Sibẹsibẹ, otitọ ọrọ naa ni, diẹ ninu awọn yoo.
We held hands as we crossed the river.	A di ọwọ mu bi a ti n kọja odo naa.
Summer vacations are long.	Awọn isinmi ooru jẹ pipẹ.
Food for thought.	Ounjẹ fun ero.
Maybe you do.	Boya o ṣe.

My cat is making songs on his app.	Ologbo mi n ṣe awọn orin lori ohun elo rẹ.
He got it.	O si ni o.
Get better this week.	Gba dara ni ọsẹ yii.
We are watching.	Ti a n wo.
You need someone like you.	O nilo ẹnikan bi iwọ.
The seat is full.	Ijoko ti kun.
Again he tried to turn in the water.	Lẹẹkansi o gbiyanju lati yi pada ninu omi.
It was his first love.	O jẹ ifẹ akọkọ rẹ.
The car will not start.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kii yoo bẹrẹ.
If you leave now, you can get the last train.	Ti o ba lọ kuro ni bayi, o le gba ọkọ oju irin ti o kẹhin.
I stuck everything into.	Mo di ohun gbogbo sinu.
But under it, he was troubled by something.	Ṣugbọn labẹ rẹ, o ni wahala nipasẹ nkan kan.
It could not be better.	Ko le dara.
It’s not just about you and what you want.	Kii ṣe nipa iwọ nikan ati ohun ti o fẹ.
I did not ask him why.	Emi ko beere lọwọ rẹ idi.
The important thing is that they start well.	Ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni pe wọn bẹrẹ daradara.
We are here.	A wa nibi.
The sister did not act like one at all.	Arabinrin naa ko ṣe bii ọkan paapaa.
We should be near the bottom.	A yẹ ki o wa nitosi si isalẹ.
You have nothing to go on.	O ko ni nkankan lati lọ lori.
I know what you mean, baby.	Mo mọ kini o tumọ si, ọmọ.
When my heart stopped, time seemed to flow as well.	Nigbati ọkan mi duro, akoko dabi enipe o da bi daradara.
But there are good times to be with him too.	Ṣugbọn awọn akoko ti o dara wa lati wa pẹlu rẹ paapaa.
It worries me.	O ṣe aniyan mi.
We do not have much time.	A ko ni akoko pupọ.
I'll take this.	Emi yoo mu eyi.
It was after one in the morning.	O jẹ lẹhin ọkan ni owurọ.
Do you always travel by plane?	Ṣe o nigbagbogbo rin nipasẹ ọkọ ofurufu?
We can leave.	A le lọ kuro.
Everyone is here to find jobs.	Gbogbo eniyan wa nibi lati wa awọn iṣẹ.
But, that does not make sense.	Ṣugbọn, iyẹn ko ni oye.
He will get more football.	Oun yoo gba bọọlu diẹ sii.
However, it is completely possible that you may not have a phone.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ṣee ṣe patapata pe o le ma si foonu kan.
And other friends.	Ati awọn ọrẹ miiran.
They are the parents of a one month old girl.	Wọn jẹ obi fun ọmọbirin oṣu kan.
Both girls love going to their classes.	Awọn ọmọbirin mejeeji nifẹ lilọ si awọn kilasi wọn.
I sent it to your store.	Mo fi ranṣẹ si ile itaja rẹ.
He called me.	O pe mi.
I have always loved swimming.	Mo nigbagbogbo feran lati we.
I understand how you feel.	Mo loye bi o ṣe lero.
He will not do it.	Oun yoo ko ṣe.
I mean, not just me.	Mo tumọ si, kii ṣe emi nikan.
All my friends will be able to stay.	Gbogbo awọn ọrẹ mi yoo ni anfani lati wa duro.
Life went well for a while.	Aye lọ daradara fun igba diẹ.
I think a lot about that.	Mo ronu pupọ nipa iyẹn.
I read this three times.	Mo ka eyi ni igba mẹta.
I do not want.	Emi ko fẹ.
You did nothing to me.	O ko ṣe nkankan si mi.
Good fit.	O dara o yẹ.
They do not work either.	Wọn ko ṣiṣẹ boya.
Gifts in your name can be made to love.	Awọn ẹbun ni orukọ rẹ le ṣee ṣe si ifẹ.
They want something from me first.	Wọn fẹ nkankan lati ọdọ mi ni akọkọ.
You have to tell me a story about something.	O ni lati sọ itan kan fun mi nipa nkan kan.
The heat itself felt so good to me.	Ooru ara rẹ ro dara pupọ si mi.
As expected.	Bi o ṣe yẹ.
We went to the restaurant for dinner.	A lọ si ile ounjẹ fun ounjẹ alẹ.
His father gave him money, and he took it away.	Baba rẹ fun u owo, o si mu kuro.
I started all the time, thinking he was calling me.	Mo bẹrẹ ni gbogbo igba, ni ero pe o pe mi.
But you need to understand.	Ṣugbọn o nilo lati ni oye.
You have met him at my house.	O ti pade rẹ ni ile mi.
You will not understand it.	Iwọ kii yoo loye rẹ.
The book contains personal information.	Iwe naa ni awọn alaye ti ara ẹni ninu.
Please do not laugh at me.	Jọwọ maṣe rẹrin si mi.
The city is well known now.	A mọ ilu daradara ni bayi.
I hold the phone.	Mo di foonu mu.
Drink water a day.	Mu omi ni ọjọ kan.
Materials purchased.	Awọn ohun elo ti a ra.
Dad is busy.	Baba ni ise.
However, the train was late.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọkọ oju irin naa ti pẹ.
I mean, good enough.	Mo tumọ si, o dara to.
He has been a friend.	O ti jẹ ọrẹ kan.
Will get out of the car.	Yoo jade kuro ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
This is always key.	Eyi nigbagbogbo jẹ bọtini.
That is because it is clear that they are not the same person.	Iyẹn jẹ nitori pe o han gbangba pe wọn kii ṣe eniyan kanna.
This is understandable.	Eyi jẹ oye.
It doesn't matter the look.	Ko ṣe pataki awọn wo.
It changes my word.	O n yi ọrọ mi pada.
Time will change all that.	Akoko yoo yi gbogbo iyẹn pada.
They don’t have cars.	Wọn ko ni awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
And that was good advice, too.	Ati awọn ti o wà ti o dara imọran, ju.
I start to remember it now.	Mo ti bẹrẹ lati ranti rẹ ni bayi.
I need someone.	Mo ti nilo ẹnikan.
Move if it will save money.	Gbe ti o ba ti yoo fi owo.
I don’t just feel it when you walk into a room.	Emi ko kan lero o nigbati o rin sinu yara.
The bed was on fire, and he poured water on it.	Ibusun wa lori ina, o si da omi si i.
Easy to remember.	Rọrun lati ranti.
You can be a boy.	O le jẹ ọmọkunrin.
I cannot continue to do this.	Emi ko le tẹsiwaju lati ṣe eyi.
These problems make many people anxious	Awọn iṣoro wọnyi jẹ ki ọpọlọpọ eniyan ṣe aniyan
At least yet.	O kere ju sibẹsibẹ.
Your mouth will not stop.	Ẹnu rẹ ko ni duro.
The weather is bad.	Ojo ko dara.
Come see us again soon.	Wa wo wa lẹẹkansi laipẹ.
He doesn’t seem to like me anymore, either.	O dabi pe ko fẹran mi mọ, boya.
It's coming.	O n bọ.
But it is impossible for a child to understand.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣee ṣe fun ọmọde lati ni oye.
He called me and asked me to go.	O pe mi o si beere fun mi lati lọ.
But then something happened.	Sugbon ki o si nkankan ṣẹlẹ.
Maybe next time.	Boya ni akoko miiran.
I hope he doesn’t get into trouble.	Mo nireti pe ko gba sinu wahala.
It was a difficult decision.	O jẹ ipinnu ti o nira.
We don’t think about it.	A ko ronu nipa rẹ.
This means that your wife is not afraid.	Eyi tumọ si pe iyawo rẹ ko bẹru.
The long hours that never seem to end.	Awọn wakati pipẹ ti ko dabi pe ko pari.
I have seen one of them.	Mo ti ri ọkan ninu wọn.
They were removed from the tree trunk as needed.	A yi wọn kuro ni igi igi bi o ti nilo.
He never thought about it, much less his attention.	Ko ronu nipa rẹ rara, diẹ kere si akiyesi rẹ.
All I can give you is my love.	Gbogbo ohun ti mo le fun ọ ni ifẹ mi.
Everyone uses everyone.	Gbogbo eniyan lo gbogbo eniyan.
But that will not happen here.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ nibi.
I just want to make sure nothing is wrong.	Mo kan fẹ lati rii daju pe ko si ohun ti o jẹ aṣiṣe.
We did not enjoy our meal.	A ko gbadun ounjẹ wa.
There is nothing for you to worry about.	Ko si nkankan fun ọ lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
Both agree not to agree.	Awọn mejeeji gba lati ko gba.
There you have it.	Nibẹ ni o ni.
I have asked my brother to accept my position.	Mo ti beere arakunrin mi lati gba ipo mi.
Sun.	Oorun.
This name came up.	Orukọ yi wa soke.
We do not yet know what we are doing for our vacation.	A ko mọ sibẹsibẹ ohun ti a n ṣe fun isinmi wa.
My body, my work, given to him.	Ara mi, iṣẹ mi, ti a fi fun u.
The sea is too long.	Okun naa ti gun ju.
I will no longer have an opinion.	Mo ti yoo ko to gun ni ohun ero.
This needs a big letter.	Eyi nilo lẹta nla kan.
See you again.	A tun pade.
We can go for a walk on the beach.	A le lọ rin lori eti okun.
You have received very well.	O ti gba daradara pupọ.
So much.	Pupọ gaan.
I never left that way.	Emi ko fi silẹ ni ọna yẹn.
There is nothing better to do.	Ko si ohun ti o dara julọ lati ṣe.
We could not find the right person.	A ko le ri eniyan ti o yẹ.
He would not go out without them.	Ko ni jade ni ita laisi wọn.
Hit my head on something.	Lu ori mi lori nkankan.
Well on vacation anyway.	Daradara lori isinmi eyikeyi ọna.
Not pretty.	Ko lẹwa.
He still was.	O si tun wà.
I consider her my little sister now.	Mo ro rẹ arabinrin kekere mi bayi.
Even when we are doing well, we cannot believe much.	Paapaa nigba ti a ba n ṣe daradara, a ko le gbagbọ pupọ.
Okay, that's not good enough for me.	O dara, iyẹn ko dara to fun mi.
The house is clean.	Ile naa mọ.
I'm sorry for that.	Ma binu fun iyẹn.
He wants for many things.	O si fẹ fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun.
The driver has a lot to do with that.	Awakọ naa ni ọpọlọpọ nkan lati ṣe pẹlu iyẹn.
Your friends are on the way.	Awọn ọrẹ rẹ wa ni ọna.
He will give me back.	O yoo fun mi ki pada.
Guys, get out of here.	Awọn ọmọkunrin, o yọ kuro nibi.
If water evaporates, some hot water may be added.	Ti omi ba yọ, diẹ ninu omi gbona le fi kun.
There is something else to decide.	Ohun miiran wa lati pinnu.
He is two years old.	O ni ọdun meji.
We can handle most situations, given time.	A le mu awọn ipo pupọ julọ, ti a fun ni akoko.
And so they did.	Ati bẹ wọn ṣe.
Laugh when you talk.	Rẹrin nigbati o ba sọrọ.
We care who is behind it and why.	A ṣe akiyesi ẹni ti o wa lẹhin rẹ ati idi.
Life goes on .	Igbesi aye n lọ .
At this point many questions have to be asked.	Ni aaye yii ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere ni lati beere.
Better get on with it.	Dara julọ gba lori rẹ.
Look, it’s with the area.	Wo, o wa pẹlu agbegbe naa.
It stands on a body in a box.	O duro lori ara kan ninu apoti.
And for many it will be helpful.	Ati fun ọpọlọpọ yoo jẹ iranlọwọ.
I do not know what you will do.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o yoo ṣe.
As such, their work is important.	Bi iru bẹẹ, iṣẹ wọn ṣe pataki.
When he had a party, he was already married to her.	Nigbati o ba ni ẹgbẹ kan, o ti ni iyawo si rẹ.
This test is worth doing.	Idanwo yii tọ lati ṣe.
You can say them here or not.	O le sọ wọn nibi tabi rara.
He forced the door.	O fi agbara mu ilẹkun.
Your new life is not like your old life.	Igbesi aye tuntun rẹ ko dabi igbesi aye atijọ rẹ.
You think you are great at your job, good to work for.	O ro pe o jẹ nla ni iṣẹ rẹ, o dara lati ṣiṣẹ fun.
Everyone can see what it is.	Gbogbo eniyan le rii kini o jẹ.
The test is difficult.	Idanwo naa le.
And he took it.	O si mu u.
However he obviously did not.	Sibẹsibẹ o han pe o ko ṣe bẹ.
Get such a car.	Gba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ diẹ bẹ.
You will be alone, outside.	Iwọ yoo wa nikan, ni ita.
This tutorial will help you improve your skills.	Iwe ẹkọ ẹkọ yii yoo ṣe iranlọwọ mu awọn ọgbọn rẹ dara si.
Not as you thought, he said.	Kii ṣe bi o ti ro, o sọ.
Family's last meal.	Ebi ká kẹhin ounjẹ.
Some of them.	Diẹ ninu wọn.
But always they have more to say.	Ṣugbọn nigbagbogbo wọn ni diẹ lati sọ.
When he heard a question, he looked up.	Nigbati o gbọ ibeere kan, o wo soke.
He has so much to give us.	O ni pupọ lati fun wa.
Let’s talk about the whole thing.	Jẹ ki a sọrọ nipa gbogbo nkan naa.
Both became a member at this restaurant.	Awọn mejeeji di ẹgbẹ kan ni ile ounjẹ yii.
Maybe they should consider doing so regularly.	Boya wọn yẹ ki o ronu ṣiṣe bẹ nigbagbogbo.
Her eyes are small.	Oju rẹ jẹ kekere.
I hate that it’s probably true.	Mo korira pe o jasi otitọ.
But if not for you, that's fine too.	Ṣugbọn ti kii ba ṣe fun ọ, iyẹn dara paapaa.
Do not forget that you should send us reports.	Maṣe gbagbe pe o yẹ ki o fi awọn iroyin ranṣẹ si wa.
He looked around their side.	O wo ni ayika ẹgbẹ wọn.
They stand around you now.	Wọn duro ni ayika rẹ ni bayi.
Your brother has given you his life back.	Arakunrin rẹ ti fun ọ ni igbesi aye rẹ pada.
I do not understand why it will not work.	Emi ko loye idi ti kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
The community said no.	Agbegbe sọ rara.
But we could not go home for two reasons.	Ṣugbọn a ko le lọ si ile fun idi meji.
I hope you do too.	Mo nireti pe o tun ṣe.
It doesn't matter.	Ko ṣe pataki.
I closed the box.	Mo pa apoti naa.
No questions met here.	Ko si ibeere ti o pade nibi.
It was sunny, but the day was warm.	O jẹ oorun, ṣugbọn ọjọ gbona.
If you do not remember anything else of mine.	Ti o ko ba ranti ohunkohun miiran ti mi.
But it was hard to find a good off the field.	Sugbon o je gidigidi lati ri kan ti o dara pa awọn aaye.
Of course, nothing goes to plan.	Dajudaju, ko si ohun ti o lọ lati gbero.
This year is one of them.	Odun yii jẹ ọkan ninu wọn.
There are other benefits of journalism.	Awọn anfani miiran wa ti iwe iroyin.
It will be very difficult to stop that.	Yoo nira pupọ lati da iyẹn duro.
What you think becomes you.	Ohun ti o ro di o.
They met one day, at a restaurant.	Wọn pade ni ọjọ kan, ni ile ounjẹ kan.
But we have to keep them here.	Sugbon a ni lati tọju wọn nibi.
The house has several rooms.	Ile naa ni awọn yara pupọ.
I will find the right way.	Emi yoo wa ọna ti o tọ.
He gave me everything and everything.	O fun mi ni ohun gbogbo pupọ ati ohunkohun.
Get in the car.	Wọ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
It tells a story that took three days to tell.	O sọ itan kan ti o gba ọjọ mẹta lati sọ.
I am looking to buy a house.	Mo n wa lati ra ile kan.
I love to run.	Mo nifẹ lati ṣiṣe.
Our approach to education is flawed.	Ọna wa si ẹkọ jẹ aṣiṣe.
That may be associated with it.	Iyẹn le ni nkan ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
I don't know what's going on.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
We know them when they are little.	A mọ wọn nigbati wọn wa ni kekere.
More or less, people love most of them.	Diẹ sii tabi kere si, eniyan nifẹ pupọ julọ ninu wọn.
He entered the big house.	O wọ inu ile nla naa.
By his mother's hand, from the time he was good.	Nipa ọwọ iya rẹ, lati igba ti o ti dara.
That is family law.	Ofin idile niyen.
I do not know the future.	Emi ko mọ ojo iwaju.
Let it end.	Jẹ ki o pari.
Because he was physically back then.	Nitori ti o wà ni ara pada ki o si.
A boy was born.	A bi ọmọkunrin kan.
The people around him changed.	Awọn eniyan ti o wa ni ayika rẹ yipada.
It doesn't matter what you say to him.	Ko ṣe pataki ohun ti o sọ fun u.
It was nice to get the ball back in my hands.	O dun lati gba bọọlu pada si ọwọ mi.
They began to eat well.	Wọn bẹrẹ si jẹun daradara.
I will talk to you through it.	Emi yoo ba ọ sọrọ nipasẹ rẹ.
Can't remember the dog's name.	Ko le ranti orukọ aja naa.
You think your life is slipping away.	O ro pe igbesi aye rẹ n yọ kuro.
You get a cup of tea.	O gba ife tii kan.
I show you why.	Mo fi idi rẹ han ọ.
This tree has grown vigorously.	Igi yii ti dagba ni agbara.
You have to talk to him.	O ni lati sọrọ pẹlu rẹ.
We know, we know, give us rest.	A mọ, a mọ, fun wa ni isinmi.
That is a fact.	Otitọ niyẹn.
I love your hand.	Mo nifẹ ọwọ rẹ.
Something about his tone made me look up.	Nkankan nipa ohun orin rẹ jẹ ki n wo soke.
Tell them they don’t have time to talk about it.	Sọ fun wọn pe wọn ko ni akoko lati sọrọ nipa rẹ.
They didn’t go into trouble for a while.	Wọn ko lọ sinu wahala fun igba diẹ.
I need it there.	Mo nilo rẹ nibẹ.
It almost destroyed everything.	O fẹrẹ ba ohun gbogbo jẹ.
A little boy, dressed in purple.	Ọmọ kekere kan, ti o wọ aṣọ eleyi ti.
There is a car on your way.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan wa ni ọna rẹ.
It has happened forever and one day.	O ti ṣẹlẹ lailai ati ọjọ kan.
The house is near the river.	Ile naa wa nitosi odo.
This will cause the game to end.	Eyi yoo mu ki ere naa pari.
No news, nothing to say.	Ko ni iroyin, ko si nkankan lati sọ.
Neither of us said anything.	Bẹni ninu wa ko sọ ohunkohun.
She drove her children to school.	O wakọ awọn ọmọ rẹ si ile-iwe.
I am in great trouble.	Mo wa ninu wahala nla gaan.
I hope it helps.	Mo nireti pe o ṣe iranlọwọ.
Good, but not a test.	O dara, ṣugbọn kii ṣe idanwo.
I mean, it just looks so good.	Mo tumọ si, o kan wo dara julọ.
Maybe not true.	Boya kii ṣe otitọ.
Fire can feel like the days of your life.	Ina le ro bi awọn ọjọ ti aye re.
Before lunch, the streets were still open.	Ṣaaju ki o to ọsan, awọn ita wà ṣi.
Try to learn how to speak.	Gbiyanju lati kọ bi o ṣe n sọrọ.
Let's do this.	Jẹ ki a ṣe eyi.
But that is how it is.	Sugbon bi o se ri niyen.
They will help us.	Wọn yoo ran wa lọwọ.
Carry on.	Ma se lo.
This is what you do now.	Eyi ni o ṣe ni bayi.
I’ve dropped on my own understanding.	Mo ti sọ silẹ lori oye ara mi.
The streets are full of people rushing to the office.	Awọn opopona ti kun fun awọn eniyan ti n yara lọ si ọfiisi.
We would love to hear from you.	A nifẹ pupọ lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
I always refuse.	Mo nigbagbogbo kọ.
It will be a big rain.	Ojo nla ni yoo je.
That was several years ago.	Iyẹn jẹ ọdun pupọ sẹhin.
On my phone everything works great.	Lori foonu mi ohun gbogbo n ṣiṣẹ nla.
Change the rules.	Yi pada awọn ofin.
These devices are able to fly at low altitudes.	Awọn ẹrọ wọnyi ni anfani lati fo ni giga kekere.
But you also have to sleep sometimes.	Sugbon o tun ni lati sun nigba miiran.
You know you know it.	O mọ pe o mọ ọ.
Sure, let’s make that a little bit easier.	Daju, jẹ ki a sọ iyẹn di diẹ diẹ.
And we are still waiting.	Ati pe a tun n duro de.
I have seen you carry that book.	Mo ti ri pe o gbe iwe yẹn.
I'll give it to you now, just listen to me.	Emi yoo fun ọ ni bayi, o kan gbọ mi.
Who knows why.	Tani o mọ idi.
But things will be there.	Ṣugbọn awọn nkan yoo wa ti o wa.
And if you missed them, you can still see them here.	Ati pe ti o ba padanu wọn, o tun le wo wọn nibi.
He stuck his head inside.	O di ori rẹ si inu.
He is a good person, you will love him.	O jẹ eniyan ti o dara, iwọ yoo fẹ rẹ.
The children did not listen.	Awọn ọmọde ko gbọ.
I have a door behind me.	Mo ti ilẹkun lẹhin mi.
Do not forget where you are from.	Maṣe gbagbe ibiti o ti wa.
This time they were not fast.	Ni akoko yii wọn ko sare.
Now no.	Bayi ko si.
We have the power.	A ni agbara.
I let it stand.	Mo jẹ ki o duro.
You must not kill.	Iwọ ko gbọdọ pa.
If you do not, you will not last long.	Ti o ko ba ṣe, iwọ kii yoo pẹ.
Everything we needed.	Ohun gbogbo ti a nilo.
Not good when that happens at work.	Ko dara nigbati iyẹn ba ṣẹlẹ ni iṣẹ.
It will not tell anyone.	Ko ni so fun enikeni.
But that is now over.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ti pari ni bayi.
I think we will die.	Mo ro pe a yoo ku.
The background was the same.	Awọn lẹhin je kanna.
We are not such a place.	A kii ṣe iru ibi yẹn.
The cost of travel is very important.	Iye owo ti o wa ninu irin-ajo jẹ pataki pupọ.
I do not know about you, boy.	Emi ko mọ nipa rẹ, ọmọkunrin.
It cannot be changed.	Ko le yipada.
Young people and adolescents are especially vulnerable.	Awọn ọdọ ati awọn ọdọ jẹ ipalara paapaa.
Okay, hope to hear what you have to say.	O dara, nireti lati gbọ ohun ti o ni lati sọ.
We can sleep when we get home.	A le sun nigba ti a ba de ile wa.
You have a month to find your place.	O ni oṣu kan lati wa aaye tirẹ.
Of course it is a very broad issue.	Dajudaju o jẹ ọrọ kan pupọ.
I have to go out and meet them.	Mo ni lati jade lọ pade wọn.
He will leave everyone alone.	Oun yoo fi gbogbo eniyan silẹ nikan.
Sounds great, but it doesn't work so well in reality.	Dun nla ni imọran, ṣugbọn ko ṣiṣẹ daradara bẹ ni otitọ.
There is something wrong with that person.	Nkankan wa ti ko tọ nipa eniyan yẹn.
Back to back.	Pada si ẹhin.
Many have heard the story.	Ọpọlọpọ ti gbọ itan.
He did that thing there.	O ṣe nkan yẹn nibẹ.
Good on me.	O dara ninu mi.
I also like to paint.	Mo tun feran lati kun.
I do not see it like this.	Emi ko ri i bi eleyi.
I was just thinking about something he told me.	Mo kan n ronu nipa ohun kan ti o sọ fun mi.
The same thing applies to a home site.	Ohun kan naa yoo kan si aaye ile kan.
What could be wrong ?.	Kini o le jẹ aṣiṣe?.
They are waiting for you.	Won n duro de e.
People are also more powerful and pay more attention.	Awọn eniyan tun ni agbara pupọ julọ ati san akiyesi diẹ sii.
Who knew he had so much.	Tani o mọ pe o ni ọpọlọpọ.
Eat a good lunch.	Je kan ti o dara ọsan.
They have done what they want.	Wọn ti ṣe ohun ti wọn fẹ.
That is not what this is.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti eyi jẹ.
Get off my back.	Lọ kuro ni ẹhin mi.
It doesn't matter to me.	Ko ṣe pataki si mi.
You know what they say about men.	O mọ ohun ti wọn sọ nipa awọn ọkunrin.
And the price continues to rise.	Ati pe iye owo naa tẹsiwaju lati dide.
You are not them, and they are not you.	Iwọ kii ṣe wọn, ati pe wọn kii ṣe iwọ.
We will walk in front of you.	A yoo rin ni iwaju rẹ.
I hope you can get a job soon.	Mo nireti pe o le gba iṣẹ kan laipẹ.
He hopes he will help bring everything out.	O nireti pe oun yoo ṣe iranlọwọ lati gbe ohun gbogbo jade.
Let’s see what can be done yet.	Jẹ ki a wo ohun ti o le ṣee ṣe sibẹsibẹ.
Man can only drink so much.	Eniyan le nikan mu ki Elo.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Jọwọ sọ fun mi iru ile itaja ti o rii ni.
You have to help me.	O ni lati ran mi lọwọ.
I want you to see your mother.	Mo fe ki e wo iya re.
You can not feel them.	O ko le lero wọn.
Roads are full, especially during fast hours.	Awọn opopona ti kun, paapaa ni wakati ti o yara.
I have to go back, he thought.	Mo ni lati pada, o ro.
It just goes around the side.	O kan n lọ ni ayika ẹgbẹ naa.
Give him rest.	Fun u ni isinmi.
I am here and there.	Mo wa nibi ati pe o wa nibẹ.
It is completely cut off.	O ti ge patapata.
Very nice and nice.	Rọrun dara julọ.
I get that.	Mo gba iyẹn.
It was an important meeting for him.	O jẹ ipade pataki fun u.
You can also indulge in poor diet.	O tun le fi ara rẹ si ounjẹ ti ko dara.
But he is the one who really knows the power of love.	Ṣugbọn oun ni ẹni ti o mọ agbara ifẹ gaan.
I use it because it works great.	Mo lo nitori pe o ṣiṣẹ nla.
Do you drink a lot of water?	Ṣe o mu omi pupọ?
Possibly, however.	O ṣee ṣe, sibẹsibẹ.
I want to be there so bad.	Mo fẹ lati wa nibẹ ki buburu.
I turned to run.	Mo yipada lati sare.
I thought it.	Mo ro rẹ.
They want everyone to know their story.	Wọn fẹ ki gbogbo eniyan mọ itan wọn.
Certainly not me.	Dajudaju kii ṣe emi.
Let the children grow up outside.	Fi awọn ọmọde dagba ni ita.
Who knows what might have become.	Tani o mọ ohun ti o le ti di.
You will not believe me.	O yoo ko gbagbọ mi.
Let me ask you something.	Jẹ ki n beere lọwọ rẹ nkankan.
How nice to see it.	Bawo ni o dara lati ri i.
However, everything went well and ended well.	Sibẹsibẹ, ohun gbogbo dara ti o pari daradara.
I think he will come back here now.	Mo ro pe oun yoo pada wa si ibi ni bayi.
It has to be so.	O ni lati jẹ bẹ.
I got them back.	Mo ti gba wọn pada.
He ate with her.	O jẹun pẹlu rẹ.
See this site tomorrow.	Wo aaye yii ni ọla.
You have your way with it.	O ni ọna rẹ pẹlu rẹ.
Her brother did.	Arakunrin rẹ ti ṣe.
This was not good, however.	Eleyi je ko dara, sibẹsibẹ.
I think you have to do it.	Mo ro pe o ni lati ṣe.
.	.
Another point.	Miiran ori aaye.
Everything is as it was.	Ohun gbogbo jẹ bi o ti fi silẹ.
You know all the music stores nearby.	O mọ gbogbo awọn ile itaja orin nitosi.
We have no place to go.	A ko ni aaye lati lọ.
You will be better than my friend here.	Iwọ yoo dara ju ọrẹ mi lọ nibi.
That time is not enough.	Akoko naa ko to.
I do not think we will need their help.	Emi ko ro pe a yoo nilo iranlọwọ wọn.
That is not very easy.	Iyẹn ko rọrun pupọ.
This will be difficult but not impossible.	Eyi yoo nira ṣugbọn kii ṣe ko ṣeeṣe.
I really enjoyed it.	Mo gbadun paapaa.
So they can find me in two ways.	Nitorina wọn le wa mi ni ọna meji.
I left that.	Mo fi iyẹn silẹ.
You can get out of here tomorrow.	O le jade kuro nibi ni ọla.
He can't let you sleep on this.	Ko le jẹ ki o sun lori eyi.
It is not a physical thing for some people.	Kii ṣe nkan ti o wa nipa ti ara fun awọn eniyan kan.
He could not walk because his leg was broken.	Ko le rin nitori ẹsẹ rẹ ti fọ.
The only question you forgot to ask.	Ibeere nikan ni o gbagbe lati beere.
But it was better to stay on that edge for me.	Ṣugbọn o dara julọ lati duro ni eti yẹn fun mi.
Some people may like it, some people may not.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan le fẹran rẹ, diẹ ninu awọn eniyan le ma ṣe.
You are not killed.	A ko pa ọ.
I mean, that's fine.	Mo tumọ si, iyẹn dara.
Repeat and do to both sides.	Tun ṣe ati ṣe si ẹgbẹ mejeeji.
Leave the questions manually.	Fi awọn ibeere silẹ pẹlu ọwọ.
I have no idea how it works.	Emi ko ni imọran bi o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
It is going well, better than you expected.	O n lọ daradara, dara ju bi o ti nireti lọ.
The fact that it has no account for me.	Awọn o daju wipe o ni ko ni iroyin fun mi.
I am in a difficult situation as many.	Mo wa ninu ipo ti o nira bi ọpọlọpọ.
Back on track.	Pada lori orin.
You will come through this.	Iwọ yoo wa nipasẹ eyi.
The fire was still hot.	Ina si tun gbona.
This is what.	Ohun ni yi.
These people are not here.	Kii ṣe awọn eniyan wọnyi nibi.
We'll just wait and see.	A yoo kan duro ati rii.
He went to the contract.	O lọ si adehun naa.
You are wrong.	O ṣe aṣiṣe.
We had already finished lunch when the bus arrived.	A ti pari ounjẹ ọsan tẹlẹ nigbati ọkọ akero wa.
But one day it will help.	Ṣugbọn ọjọ kan yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.
They are but three.	Wọn jẹ ṣugbọn mẹta.
You have the skills to do more.	O ni awọn ọgbọn lati ṣe diẹ sii.
The work environment is high energy.	Ayika iṣẹ jẹ agbara giga.
It was in the box for several hours.	O wa ninu apoti fun awọn wakati pupọ.
And no one expected him to be human.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti o nireti pe oun yoo jẹ eniyan.
But they did not.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko ṣe e.
See where you get it.	Wo ibi ti o gba ọ.
We need to be together again.	A nilo lati wa papọ lẹẹkansi.
We will see.	A yoo rii.
The same.	Elo kanna.
You don’t want to get out of bed.	O ko fẹ lati lọ kuro ni ibusun.
You love it here.	O nifẹ rẹ nibi.
It tells you how to find or do these things.	O sọ fun ọ bi o ṣe le wa tabi ṣe awọn nkan wọnyi.
You have planned it well.	O ti gbero rẹ daradara.
They have heard the stories.	Wọn ti gbọ awọn itan.
It does not have to be you or me anymore.	Ko si ni lati jẹ iwọ tabi emi mọ.
In fact, there may be only one.	Ni otitọ, o le jẹ ọkan nikan.
But here it is.	Sugbon nibi o wa.
It is impossible to say how old he was.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati sọ ọdun melo ti o jẹ.
I can't drink.	Nko le mu.
Back home too.	Pada si ile paapaa.
Would they be okay?	Ṣe wọn yoo dara?
Just talk, he said.	Kan sọrọ, o sọ.
I take it to your advice.	Mo gba a si imọran rẹ.
They are very small.	Wọn kere pupọ.
But neither of them will sell his books.	Ṣugbọn bẹni ninu wọn kii yoo ta awọn iwe rẹ.
Of course you did.	Dajudaju o ti ṣe.
Not a beautiful vehicle.	Ko kan lẹwa ọkọ.
It must be very hot there.	O gbọdọ gbona pupọ nibẹ.
But he did not come back.	Sugbon ko pada wa.
That was to hurt him the most.	Iyẹn ni lati ṣe ipalara fun u julọ.
I can tell you it was some work.	Mo le so fun o pe o je diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ.
You can do a little more now.	O le ṣe diẹ diẹ sii ni bayi.
The sister would not be so good to anything that came out.	Arabinrin ko ni dara pupọ si ohunkohun ti o jade lọ.
Learn more below !.	Kọ ẹkọ diẹ sii ni isalẹ!.
They do not cause trouble.	Wọn ko fa wahala.
Maybe no one knows.	Boya ko si ẹniti o mọ.
You do not know all the facts about something.	O ko mọ gbogbo otitọ nipa nkan kan.
They are not enough.	Wọn ko jẹ ohun to.
He looked down at her.	O si wo isalẹ ni oju rẹ.
That could be.	Iyẹn le jẹ.
Which makes me ask.	Eyi ti o mu ki n beere.
You do not have to do anything.	O ko ni lati ṣe ohunkohun.
This did not go the way he intended.	Eyi ko lọ ni ọna ti o pinnu.
Some with missed opportunities.	Diẹ ninu awọn pẹlu awọn anfani ti o padanu.
So we decided to make a new application.	Nitorina a pinnu lati ṣe ohun elo tuntun kan.
To tell me when my family found out.	Lati so fun mi nigbati ebi mi ri jade.
Now it will not.	Bayi kii yoo ṣe.
We stopped in your car and took your supplies.	A duro ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ ati pe o gba awọn ohun elo rẹ.
She is the mother of three children.	O jẹ iya ti ọmọ mẹta.
We have not been here before.	A ko ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
The car park will be a great place.	Ibudo ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yoo jẹ aaye nla kan.
There is so much to lose.	Pupọ wa lati padanu.
It was what everyone thought.	O je ohun ti gbogbo eniyan ro.
Pay cash.	San owo ni owo.
They just don't like it.	Wọn kan ko fẹran rẹ.
I thought it before.	Mo ro rẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
You have to wait for something more.	O ni lati duro fun nkan diẹ sii.
But it doesn’t feel like that at the very least.	Ṣugbọn ko rilara bii iyẹn ni aaye ti o kere julọ.
But that is not all the information.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe gbogbo alaye naa.
Time to hit the river.	Akoko lati lu odo.
You have to make your decision.	O ni lati ṣe ipinnu rẹ.
These methods will only benefit people who are employed.	Awọn ọna wọnyi yoo ṣe anfani awọn eniyan ti o ni iṣẹ nikan.
I have been feeling it for a few days from within.	Mo ti rilara rẹ fun awọn ọjọ diẹ lati inu.
Ahead with me.	Ni iwaju pẹlu mi.
Or it from her.	Tabi o lati rẹ.
Up and up it goes.	Si oke ati oke o lọ.
It may even take two or three weeks, or a month.	O le paapaa gba ọsẹ meji tabi mẹta, tabi oṣu kan.
I just do not know what.	Mo kan ko mọ kini.
That will affect you.	Iyẹn yoo kan ọ.
Thus, making small spaces feel smaller.	Bayi, ṣiṣe awọn aaye kekere lero kere.
They are not such a thing.	Wọn kii ṣe iru nkan.
If you try to change it, it will stop.	Ti o ba gbiyanju lati yi pada, o yoo duro sẹhin.
We are not allowed to see it completed.	Ko wa laaye lati rii pe o pari.
We just made them in the same room.	A kan ṣe wọn ni yara kanna.
It has been on its own for a very long time.	O ti wa lori ara rẹ fun igba pipẹ pupọ.
Pick a lot of hair from your head.	Mu ọpọlọpọ awọn irun irun lati ori rẹ.
You see how easy it is to make something out of nothing.	O rii bi o ṣe rọrun lati ṣe nkan lati ohunkohun.
They do not have a child together.	Wọn ko ni ọmọ kan papọ.
But they work.	Ṣugbọn wọn ṣiṣẹ.
My energy is out.	Agbara mi ti jade.
No one was arrested.	Ko si ẹnikan ti a mu.
His tail came out again.	Iru rẹ tun jade lẹẹkansi.
And no.	Ati pe ko si.
That's what we really want.	Ohun ti a fẹ gan niyẹn.
They let my mother see me.	Wọn jẹ ki iya mi ri mi.
No, fear not, no.	Rara, bẹru, rara.
The student did well in this school.	Ọmọ ile-iwe naa ṣe daradara ni ile-iwe yii.
Most people will have to buy a car.	Pupọ eniyan yoo ni lati ra ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
They need you more than you need this.	Wọn nilo rẹ diẹ sii ju ti o nilo eyi.
I mean, look at wisdom.	Mo tumọ si, wo ni ọgbọn.
You do not know what to do with the food.	O ko mọ kini lati ṣe pẹlu awọn ounjẹ.
So this is what you die for?	Nitorina eyi ni ohun ti o ku fun?
That is, if you want to get.	Iyẹn ni, ti o ba fẹ gba.
The little girl hated their school.	Ọmọbirin kekere naa korira ile-iwe wọn.
It has all happened.	O ti ṣẹlẹ gbogbo.
With what you have written, some values ​​may not even appear at all.	Pẹlu ohun ti o ti kọ, awọn iye kan le paapaa han rara.
He did not do any of that.	Oun ko ṣe eyikeyi ninu iyẹn.
You do not have me.	Iwọ ko ni mi.
I did not notice anything.	Emi ko ṣe akiyesi ohun kan.
Can't wait to try it.	Ko le duro lati gbiyanju rẹ.
I can't agree with you anymore.	Emi ko le gba pẹlu rẹ diẹ sii.
Most people commit themselves to what they think they can do.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan fi ara wọn si ohun ti wọn ro pe wọn le ṣe.
It feels.	O ni rilara.
You know the car.	O mọ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
But something is wrong.	Ṣugbọn nkankan ko tọ.
I will contact you if ideas need to change.	Emi yoo kan si ọ ti ero ba nilo lati yipada.
I can't wait to read the book.	Nko le duro lati ka iwe naa.
And you asked well.	Ati pe o beere daradara.
I do not know why you do not see that.	Emi ko mọ idi ti iwọ ko fi rii iyẹn.
They may want us to touch them but not you.	Wọn le fẹ ki a fi ọwọ kan wọn ṣugbọn ko fi ọwọ kan ọ.
He hopes it is.	O nireti pe o wa.
It’s about how good things can be.	O jẹ nipa bi awọn ohun ti o dara ṣe le jẹ.
All of this seems age-appropriate to me.	Gbogbo eyi dabi ọjọ ori si mi.
I think it was the right thing to do.	Mo ro pe o jẹ ohun ti o tọ lati ṣe.
Is this book good for children?	Njẹ iwe yii dara fun awọn ọmọde?
He said to himself.	O sọ fun ara rẹ.
He slipped out of the chair.	O si yọ kuro lori ijoko.
Its purpose is the importance of money.	Awọn idi rẹ ni pataki ti owo.
Some get me over it.	Awọn diẹ gba mi lori rẹ.
No need.	Ko nilo.
I look at it, it can't move.	Mo wo rẹ, ko le gbe.
He did not know what, like anything, to say to the man.	Oun ko mọ ohun ti, bi ohunkohun, lati sọ fun ọkunrin naa.
All information is there.	Gbogbo alaye wa nibẹ.
For one, it is not possible.	Fun ọkan, ko ṣee ṣe.
It was another night without dinner.	O jẹ alẹ miiran laisi ounjẹ alẹ.
They will give you whatever you want.	Wọn yoo fun ọ ni ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
No one knows much about it.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ pupọ nipa rẹ.
Their eyes met.	Oju won pade.
This car has problems.	Ẹrọ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yii ni awọn iṣoro.
No questions about it.	Ko si ibeere nipa rẹ.
I would like to have one.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ni ọkan.
That can be a problem.	Iyẹn le jẹ iṣoro kan.
And hear a few stories.	Ati ki o gbọ kan diẹ itan.
You should not have written those books.	O yẹ ki o ko ti kọ awọn iwe yẹn.
You have an inside.	O ni ohun inu.
They love more.	Wọn nifẹ diẹ sii.
You can not change that.	O ko le yi iyẹn pada.
I miss this a lot.	Mo padanu eyi pupọ.
I do not enjoy it.	Emi ko gbadun rẹ.
It was as if he were reading my heart.	O dabi ẹni pe o n ka ọkan mi.
But that changed.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn yipada.
We agree that it does not.	A gba pe ko ṣe.
But that doesn’t matter.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣe pataki.
See the brothers working.	Wo awọn arakunrin ṣiṣẹ.
The plane is full.	Ọkọ ofurufu ti kun.
This city is small and sunny, almost deserted at night.	Ilu yi kere ati oorun, o fẹrẹ fi silẹ ni alẹ.
I don’t pull too hard because of that.	Emi ko fa lile pupọ nitori iyẹn.
That’s what he did and how he learned to talk.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti o ṣe ati bii o ṣe kọ lati sọrọ.
At least that’s what makes it great for me.	O kere ju iyẹn ni ohun ti o jẹ ki o jẹ nla si mi.
A good question deserves another good question.	Ibeere ti o dara kan yẹ ibeere ti o dara miiran.
These days it is easy to find.	Awọn ọjọ wọnyi o rọrun lati wa.
And it invites you to find a game.	Ati pe o n pe ọ lati wa ere.
I wish there was a way to be convinced.	Mo fẹ pe ọna kan wa lati ni idaniloju.
But do not worry.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe aniyan.
We used to go out and everyone would laugh at us.	A lo jade ati gbogbo eniyan yoo rẹrin si wa.
This is where the player comes in.	Eyi ni ibi ti ẹrọ orin wa.
That seems to work.	Iyẹn dabi pe wọn ṣiṣẹ.
That obviously is not enough.	Iyẹn han gbangba ko pe.
And parents want to be.	Ati awọn obi fẹ lati wa.
In fact, this may already be happening.	Ni otitọ, eyi le ti n ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
If they find higher classes, they will probably move up.	Ti wọn ba rii awọn kilasi giga, o ṣee ṣe wọn yoo gbe soke.
There must be a reason, a reason.	Idi kan gbọdọ wa, idi kan.
Some believe it is right.	Diẹ ninu awọn gbagbọ pe o tọ.
He killed himself.	O pa ara rẹ.
It will not happen.	Kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
I got up and went out.	Mo dide ki o si jade.
Okay, you can have a place.	O dara, o le ni aaye kan.
The problem is that it does not work.	Iṣoro naa ni pe ko ṣiṣẹ.
It took me a while to pick up the name.	O gba mi ni igba diẹ lati gbe orukọ naa.
More than that, there are many of them.	Diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ, ọpọlọpọ wọn wa.
Come on in here.	Wa lori nibi.
It was their time to run with it.	O jẹ akoko wọn lati sare pẹlu rẹ.
Not very pretty but at least working.	Ko si lẹwa pupọ ṣugbọn o kere ṣiṣẹ.
You look at it, you are happy.	O wo o, inu rẹ dun.
Some people do, and some people don’t.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ṣe, ati diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ko.
Something you can do something with.	Ohun kan ti o le ṣe nkankan pẹlu.
I do not know how you did that.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe ṣe iyẹn.
Again, he waited, until he did not.	Lẹẹkansi, o duro, titi ti o ko.
I lost a friend.	Mo ti padanu ọrẹ kan.
You have ideas.	O ni ero.
Find what you have on it.	Wa ohun ti o ni lori rẹ.
And, of course, they do.	Ati pe, dajudaju, wọn ṣe.
I tore the letter.	Mo fa lẹta naa ya.
Many cities also have festivals and celebrations.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ilu tun ni awọn ayẹyẹ ati awọn ayẹyẹ miiran.
It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.	O je ko buburu, sugbon o je ko nla boya.
I am not meant to hurt anyone.	Emi ko ṣe lati ṣe ipalara fun ẹnikẹni.
What we saw was amazing.	Ohun ti a rii jẹ iyalẹnu.
Find a way to make it happen.	Wa ọna lati jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
They are on a decision point.	Wọn wa lori aaye ipinnu kan.
He has lived a long time with his sister.	O ti gbe igba pipẹ pẹlu arabinrin rẹ.
Sorry, just started my dog.	Ma binu, o kan bẹrẹ aja mi.
More like their parents.	Diẹ sii bi awọn obi wọn.
It is understandable.	O jẹ oye.
This amount will suffice.	Iye yii yoo to.
Never seen anything like it before.	Ko ri ohunkohun bi o ṣaaju ki o to.
In the end, he left.	Ni ipari, o lọ kuro.
You did not do very well today.	O ko ṣe daradara pupọ loni.
His voice rose.	Ohun Re si dide.
You have to run that.	O ni lati ṣiṣe iyẹn.
You see yourself.	O wo ara rẹ.
It can be really bad.	O le jẹ buburu yẹn gaan.
Possibly of course.	O ṣee ṣe dajudaju.
You just want to work.	O kan fẹ lati ṣiṣẹ.
He did not pay attention to either side as he could break.	Ko ṣe akiyesi si ẹgbẹ mejeeji bi o ṣe le fọ.
So there is a lot of material.	Nitorina ohun elo pupọ wa.
I want a sister.	Mo fe arabinrin kan.
They were very beautiful when they were young.	Wọn lẹwa pupọ nigbati wọn kere.
I do not know where it will take me.	Emi ko mọ ibiti yoo mu mi.
I do this at home.	Mo ṣe eyi ni ile.
Local Build small.	Agbegbe Kọ kekere.
I hate the word.	Mo korira ọrọ naa.
Not just talking.	Ko kan sọrọ.
I just think the man talked too long.	Mo kan ro pe ọkunrin naa sọrọ gun ju.
Maybe something good is there.	Boya nkan ti o dara wa nibẹ.
He called his friend, who was sitting alone.	O pe ọrẹ rẹ, ti o joko nikan.
They work around the clock.	Wọn ṣiṣẹ ni ayika aago.
We really enjoyed that.	A gbadun iyẹn pupọ.
You can always pretty much get a three.	O le nigbagbogbo lẹwa Elo gba a mẹta.
Everything is in place, and where it should be.	Ohun gbogbo ni ipo, ati ni ibi ti o yẹ ki o wa.
And we still have your surprise well.	Ati pe a tun ni iyalẹnu rẹ daradara.
You did not say a word.	O ko sọ ọrọ kan.
He will be very public.	Oun yoo jẹ pupọ ni gbangba.
What would their life be like with me.	Kini yoo dabi igbesi aye wọn pẹlu mi lọ.
I know my information.	Mo mọ alaye mi.
I don’t feel so seen by anyone else.	Emi ko ni rilara bẹ ri nipa ẹnikẹni miiran.
Now we will.	Bayi a yoo.
O di baba.	O di baba.
It will break if you can.	O yoo fọ ti o ba ti o le.
Your words are hard.	Ọrọ rẹ jẹ lile.
Of course, there is also work.	Dajudaju, iṣẹ tun wa.
I wondered if he had come from home to see me.	Mo ro boya o ti wa lati ile lati ri mi.
Others killed.	Awọn miiran ti o pa.
It will make reports.	O yoo ṣe awọn iroyin.
Knocking on a big door.	Ti n kan ilẹkun nla kan.
We think it is especially important to keep young people interested.	A ro pe o ṣe pataki paapaa lati jẹ ki awọn ọdọ nifẹ si.
I think we threw the ball well.	Mo ro pe a ju bọọlu daradara.
It was an old car.	O je ohun atijọ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
She is my mother.	Iya mi ni.
It's not over yet.	Ko tii pari.
There was a woman behind him.	Obinrin kan wa lẹhin rẹ.
You want to go places.	O fẹ lati lọ si awọn aaye.
You know that in the future.	O mọ iyẹn ni iwaju.
That is the question.	Ibeere niyen.
Their eyes are closed.	Oju won pa.
That being said, look at what happened.	A sọ pe, wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
They no longer speak together.	Wọn ko sọrọ papọ mọ.
That is my life.	Iyẹn ni igbesi aye mi.
I should be fine.	Mo yẹ ki o dara.
There is very little you can do.	Diẹ diẹ ni o le ṣe.
That takes hours and hours.	Iyẹn gba awọn wakati ati awọn wakati.
And it doesn’t look like your body has changed, either.	Ati pe ko dabi pe ara rẹ yipada, boya.
Sometimes you get that.	Nigba miiran o gba iyẹn.
This alone.	Eyi nikan.
We just need more of us.	A kan nilo diẹ sii ti wa.
Some of his friends did not.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọrẹ rẹ ko ṣe.
I notice the things they do, especially.	Mo ṣe akiyesi awọn ohun ti wọn ṣe, paapaa.
And she was a grown woman, not a girl.	Ati pe o jẹ obinrin ti o dagba, kii ṣe ọmọbirin.
Remains and how long they are expected to live.	Ku ati bi o gun ti won ti wa ni o ti ṣe yẹ lati gbe.
What about your family? 	Kini nipa idile rẹ?
he asked.	o beere.
And here it is.	Ati nibi o wa.
This is the house that stands today.	Eyi ni ile ti o duro loni.
I also have two dead people.	Mo tun ni eniyan meji ti o ku.
Just look and wait.	O kan wo ati duro.
In my eyes.	Ni oju mi.
The game is not over.	Ere naa ko pari.
It seems to be a few feet away.	O dabi pe o wa ni ẹsẹ diẹ.
It's in my house.	O wa ninu ile mi.
I have never encountered such a problem before.	Emi ko tii pade iru iṣoro kan tẹlẹ.
No one takes money anymore.	Ko si ẹniti o gba owo mọ.
This is the essence of the method.	Eyi ni pataki ti ọna naa.
Same as below.	Kanna bi ni isalẹ.
We took it on board.	A mu o lori ọkọ.
But you may have kept it to yourself.	Ṣugbọn o le ti pa a mọ fun ara rẹ.
That's why you do.	Ti o ni idi ti o ṣe.

It's not just about good times.	O ni ko o kan nipa ti o dara igba.
They should do much better for the money they have spent.	Wọn yẹ ki o ṣe pupọ dara julọ fun owo ti wọn ti lo.
And no money, by the way.	Ati pe ko si owo, nipasẹ ọna.
People cut me off.	Eniyan ge mi kuro.
She went home to live with her parents.	O lọ si ile lati gbe pẹlu awọn obi rẹ.
You pay for the night.	O san fun alẹ.
You have to think what to do.	O ni lati ronu kini lati ṣe.
He was not happy to see her, he understood.	Inu re ko dun lati ri i, o loye.
Find out how bad you want it.	Wa jade bi buburu ti o fẹ o.
Something or someone.	Nkankan tabi ẹnikan.
Your application has been rejected.	Ohun elo rẹ ti kọ.
But that really is a very simple explanation.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn gaan jẹ alaye ti o rọrun pupọ.
Some of them are.	Diẹ ninu wọn jẹ.

We have seen them in our company.	A ti wo wọn ni ile-iṣẹ wa.
I will cut back.	Emi yoo ge pada.
I'm really trying.	Mo n gbiyanju gaan.
Use your power.	Lo agbara rẹ.
This is the key.	Eyi jẹ bọtini.
But no.	Ṣugbọn ko si.
Put them all back.	Gbe gbogbo wọn pada.
But we sold, you know.	Ṣugbọn a ta, o mọ.
So home and to bed.	Nitorina ile ati si ibusun.
I think some of them did it on purpose.	Mo ro pe diẹ ninu awọn ti wọn ṣe o lori idi.
No, it is not.	Rara, kii ṣe bẹ.
I would tell him, it is not your job to do that.	Emi yoo sọ fun u, kii ṣe iṣẹ rẹ lati ṣe iyẹn.
It comes when you think like it.	O wa nigbati o ro bi o.
He is here with us in this room.	O wa nibi pẹlu wa ninu yara yii.
They don't like me.	Wọn ko fẹran mi.
If they know where to get the information.	Ti wọn ba mọ ibiti o ti gba alaye naa.
He pulled out of it.	O fa jade ninu rẹ.
They do not come out well.	Wọn ko yọ jade daradara.
For the right conditions.	Fun awọn ipo ti o tọ.
My father never had that ability.	Baba mi ko ni agbara yẹn rara.
Do me no good.	Ṣe mi ko dara.
I can go with that.	Mo le lọ pẹlu iyẹn.
He wanted to return home.	O fe lati pada si ile.
This is my passion.	Eyi ni ife mi.
Try to use your hands as little as possible.	Gbiyanju lati lo ọwọ rẹ diẹ bi o ti ṣee.
It started to bother me.	O bẹrẹ lati ṣe aniyan mi.
Some of them are seen beyond the obvious.	Diẹ ninu wọn rii kọja ohun ti o han gbangba.
Or there is a school trip.	Tabi irin-ajo ile-iwe kan wa.
They believe they also live there.	Wọn gbagbọ pe wọn tun gbe nibẹ.
But you decide to do so, if you can.	Ṣugbọn o pinnu lati ṣe bẹ, ti o ba le.
You should definitely stop.	O yẹ ki o da duro dajudaju.
They are not here anymore.	Wọn ko wa nibi mọ.
Someone seriously missed the boat on this one.	Ẹnikan ṣe pataki padanu ọkọ oju omi lori eyi.
You know them very well.	O mọ wọn gaan.
That’s all we asked for.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo ohun ti a beere fun.
We know what that looks like.	A mọ bi iyẹn ṣe ri.
I came back to talk to him about that.	Mo pada wa lati ba a sọrọ nipa iyẹn.
He has picked up good points.	O ti gbe awọn aaye to dara.
He told his truth.	O sọ otitọ rẹ.
Her feet tired.	Awọn ẹsẹ rẹ ti rẹ.
That you will do anything right for you.	Pe iwọ yoo ṣe ohunkohun ti o tọ fun ọ.
I want to do better.	Mo fe lati se dara julọ.
I can't say why.	Nko le so idi.
This was pretty good.	Eleyi je lẹwa dara.
Just hold your mouth.	O kan di ẹnu rẹ mu.
They are best used as growing lights.	Wọn dara julọ ti a lo bi awọn ina dagba.
The boy told his mother about his day.	Ọmọkunrin naa sọ fun iya rẹ nipa ọjọ rẹ.
No, not good enough.	Rara, ko dara to.
Where are you?	Nibo ni o wa.
You do not have one.	O ko ni ọkan.
A friend arrives at the house.	Ọrẹ kan de ile naa.
These problems are not required.	A ko beere fun awọn iṣoro wọnyi.
They are very easy to drink now with low water.	Wọn rọrun pupọ lati mu ni bayi pẹlu omi ti o lọ silẹ.
I want to read about space.	Mo fe ka nipa aaye.
He is determined to kill us.	O ti pinnu lati pa wa.
I would improve that.	Emi yoo mu iyẹn dara si.
Stand alone that can pull you into position.	Duro nikan ti o le fa si ipo.
Rest easy.	Isinmi rọrun.
You will be measured.	A o wọn ọ.
Maybe we never did.	Boya a ko ṣe rara.
It should not have had to.	O yẹ ko ti ni lati.
She loves school.	O nifẹ ile-iwe.
It was only a piece of metal.	O je nikan kan nkan ti irin.
We will look into it.	A yoo wo inu rẹ.
Now, the time is now.	Bayi, akoko ni bayi.
It causes, but not for.	O fa, ṣugbọn ko fun.
Nothing seems to have changed.	Ko si ohun ti o dabi pe o ti yipada.
He raised an eyebrow.	O gbe oju kan soke.
It’s a pretty special thing.	O jẹ ohun pataki kan lẹwa.
That worked for me at the time.	Iyẹn ṣiṣẹ fun mi ni akoko yẹn.
He brought me back to life.	O mu mi pada si aye.
Even your celebrations are another way of making hands work.	Paapaa awọn ayẹyẹ rẹ jẹ ọna miiran ti mimu ki ọwọ ṣiṣẹ.
Last month.	Ni oṣu to kọja.
Is time travel possible?	Ṣe irin-ajo akoko ṣee ṣe?
They met at a party.	Wọn pade ni ibi ayẹyẹ kan.
I'm glad it has been yours ever since.	Inu mi dun pe o di tirẹ mu lati igba naa.
I am telling myself that no one will notice.	Mo n sọ fun ara mi pe ko si ẹnikan ti yoo ṣe akiyesi.
Maybe the men are gone.	Boya awọn ọkunrin naa ti lọ.
It is raining.	Ojo gbona.
Water heaters need electricity to operate.	Omi omi nilo ina lati ṣiṣẹ.
You know the doctors.	O mọ awọn dokita.
I can't believe this.	Emi ko le gbagbọ eyi.
Your honesty should not be questioned.	Otitọ rẹ ko yẹ ki o beere.
Okay, maybe at first.	O dara, boya ni akọkọ.
It has broken, broken, broken.	O ti fọ, fọ, fọ.
The driver picked them up.	Awakọ gbe wọn.
You should do so when you can.	O yẹ ki o ṣe bẹ nigbati o ba le.
Maybe you don't really want to know.	Boya o ko gan fẹ lati mọ.
It will take a long time.	Yoo gba akoko pipẹ.
Can't decide what to use.	Ko le pinnu kini lati lo.
You want it.	O fẹ rẹ.
She wonders if a child will be there now.	O ṣe iyalẹnu boya ọmọ kan yoo wa nibẹ ni bayi.
Another field date with that information.	Ọjọ aaye miiran pẹlu alaye yẹn.
How they do so is not well understood.	Bawo ni wọn ṣe ṣe bẹẹ ko loye daradara.
Any day now, he will give them his final terms.	Ni ọjọ eyikeyi bayi, oun yoo fun wọn ni awọn ofin ipari rẹ.
I need something to understand.	Mo nilo nkankan lati ni oye.
They are walking with us.	Wọn n rin pẹlu wa.
Of course it is important information to know.	Dajudaju o jẹ alaye ti o ṣe pataki lati mọ.
People use solar energy to heat their homes.	Awọn eniyan lo agbara oorun lati gbona ile wọn.
I think you will love it there.	Mo ro pe iwọ yoo nifẹ rẹ nibẹ.
We should have done better.	A yẹ ki o ti ṣe dara julọ.
For now, we have two observations.	Fun bayi, a ni awọn akiyesi meji.
You have known me too long to believe them.	O ti mọ mi pẹ pupọ lati gbagbọ wọn.
This is not the place to do so.	Eyi kii ṣe aaye lati ṣe bẹ.
We cannot know that of course it is not good.	A ko le mọ pe dajudaju ko dara.
We are under a lot of stress.	A wa labẹ wahala pupọ.
She is in the garden.	O wa ninu ọgba.
But the boy is around and so will he.	Ṣugbọn ọmọkunrin naa wa ni ayika ati bẹ naa yoo ṣe.
Maybe it's a good place to do it.	Boya o jẹ aaye ti o dara lati ṣe.
Notice me? 	Ṣe o ri mi?
I take this seriously.	Mo gba eleyi ni pataki.
They are excellent drivers, however.	Wọn jẹ awakọ ti o dara julọ, sibẹsibẹ.
He put me here.	O fi mi si ibi.
You know that our eyes are on you.	O mọ pe oju wa lori rẹ.
I had never thought of it that way.	Emi ko tii ronu nipa rẹ ni ọna yẹn.
He did not come to use our purpose.	O ko wa lati lo idi wa.
But in reality there is a higher truth than that.	Ṣugbọn ni otitọ otitọ wa ti o ga ju iyẹn lọ.
One minute passed, two, three.	Iṣẹju kan kọja, meji, mẹta.
The most important thing, they get, is to get out.	Ohun pataki julọ, wọn gba, ni lati jade.
This task is not as simple as it seems.	Iṣẹ yii ko rọrun bi o ṣe dabi.
In the letter.	Ninu lẹta naa.
Of course he did not stop.	Dajudaju o ko duro.
Stay there, friend.	Duro nibẹ, ọrẹ.
They will not know how to proceed.	Wọn kii yoo mọ bi wọn ṣe le tẹsiwaju.
It's my hand.	Ọwọ́ mi ni.
They have jobs to reach, families to see.	Wọn ni awọn iṣẹ lati de ọdọ, awọn idile lati rii.
The program was interesting.	Awọn eto je awon.
He is very angry now.	O binu gaan ni bayi.
We can no longer do this.	A ko le ṣe eyi mọ.
But that’s not to say it doesn’t matter.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe lati sọ pe ko ṣe pataki.
And to plan for their future together.	Ati lati gbero fun ojo iwaju wọn papọ.
Her mother died when she was little.	Iya rẹ ku nigbati o wa ni kekere.
But that is not true.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
What we didn’t see was how he got to that point.	Ohun ti a ko rii ni bi o ṣe de ipo yẹn.
I’m not sure how many times we have to say so.	Emi ko ni idaniloju iye igba ti a ni lati sọ bẹ.
But practice changes everything.	Ṣugbọn ṣiṣe ṣiṣe yi ohun gbogbo pada.
I did not find them.	Emi ko wa wọn.
He has a son, a daughter, and a good friend.	O ni ọmọkunrin kan, ọmọbirin kan, ati ọrẹ to dara kan.
He could not let his hands work, or his feet, or his eyes.	Ko le jẹ ki ọwọ rẹ ṣiṣẹ, tabi ẹsẹ rẹ, tabi oju rẹ.
They are.	Awon ni.
He fell asleep when he read.	O sun nigbati o ka.
It’s over enough as it is.	O ti kọja to bi o ti jẹ.
I don’t look beyond it.	Emi ko wo kọja rẹ.
This is an old picture of that.	Eyi jẹ aworan atijọ ti iyẹn.
We just need to be together more than we are now.	A kan nilo lati wa papọ ju ti a wa ni bayi.
We plan them into our lives.	A gbero wọn sinu aye wa.
They want to finish things to say.	Wọn fẹ pari awọn nkan lati sọ.
About the truth after he heard it went early for him.	Nipa otitọ lẹhin ti o gbọ ti o lọ ni kutukutu fun u.
Keep them.	Tọju wọn.
Do you wear any special clothing?	Ṣe o wọ eyikeyi aṣọ pataki?
They made out of his room.	Wọn ṣe jade ninu yara rẹ.
No word.	Ọrọ ti ko si.
Only the rules have changed.	Awọn ofin nikan ti yipada.
However, we believe that is a mistake.	Sibẹsibẹ, a gbagbọ pe iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe.
But it is.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ.
That was over a week ago.	Iyẹn ti kọja ọsẹ kan sẹhin.
Look around the room.	Wo ni ayika yara.
But once they do that, anything is possible.	Ṣugbọn ni kete ti wọn ṣe iyẹn, ohunkohun ṣee ṣe.
It can be written.	O le jẹ kọ.
Walk to work.	Rin lati ṣiṣẹ.
He never talked about it.	Ko sọrọ nipa rẹ rara.
There is no room.	Ko si yara.
They have been working on this problem for years.	Wọn ti ṣiṣẹ lori iṣoro yii fun awọn ọdun.
She seems happy.	O dabi pe inu rẹ dun.
It's a holiday.	O ni ọjọ isinmi.
Here you are.	O ti de ibi.
A few weeks have passed.	Awọn ọsẹ diẹ ti kọja.
We’ve talked about it a bit.	A ti sọrọ nipa rẹ diẹ.
We are teaching them in physical strength.	A n kọ wọn ni agbara ti ara.
It’s the way you look at me.	O wa ni ọna ti o wo mi.
They have a beautiful garden.	Won ni kan lẹwa ọgba.
Try to be on time.	Gbiyanju lati wa ni akoko.
He’s doing it behind his back.	O n ṣe lẹhin ẹhin rẹ.
It was everything we expected.	O jẹ ohun gbogbo ti a nireti.
Community service is more.	Iṣẹ agbegbe jẹ diẹ sii.
If it is the only money you need.	Ti o ba jẹ owo nikan ti o nilo.
Three people died in the crash.	Eniyan mẹta lo ku ninu ijamba naa.
Everyone is scared.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o bẹru.
They did not return them.	Wọn ko da wọn pada.
No, we will not be caught.	Rara, a ko ni di ọwọ mu.
I don’t waste time and shouldn’t either.	Emi ko padanu akoko ati pe o yẹ ki o ko boya.
I have no idea where we are.	Emi ko ni imọran ibiti a wa.
Just accept trial and error.	O kan gba idanwo ati aṣiṣe.
It’s nice to see someone take a less road trip.	O dara lati rii ẹnikan ti o gba ọna ti o kere si irin-ajo.
This allows students to think and work more.	Eyi jẹ ki awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ronu ati ṣiṣẹ diẹ sii.
But there are not enough of us.	Ṣugbọn nibẹ ni o wa ko to ti wa.
Sounds like a lot of money.	Dun bi a pupo ti owo.
It has taken some time to reach this point.	O ti gba igba diẹ lati de aaye yii.
I didn’t find both dogs, they came to me.	Emi ko wa aja mejeeji, wọn wa si ọdọ mi.
This is a personal favorite.	Eyi jẹ ayanfẹ ti ara ẹni.
There are people.	Awọn eniyan wa.
He finished everything.	O pari ohun gbogbo.
But the man did not listen.	Ṣugbọn ọkunrin naa ko gbọ.
And his old room.	Ati yara atijọ rẹ.
Any questions?	Eyikeyi ibeere?
He wanted to.	O ti fe.
You’ve seen it happen before.	O ti rii pe o ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
These shoes are a bargain!	Awọn bata wọnyi jẹ iye owo kan!
No one has beaten my hand.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ti lu ọwọ mi.
They left the house and walked to their car.	Wọn kuro ni ile naa wọn rin si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wọn.
A tree grew in this tree.	Igi kan dagba ninu igi yii.
They hate everything.	Wọn korira ohun gbogbo.
The dog can be a mother.	Aja le je iya.
You do not allow me.	O ko gba mi laaye.
Just.	O kan.
He went about two minutes.	O si lọ nipa meji iṣẹju.
That would be more understandable.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ oye diẹ sii.
You know something is wrong.	O mọ pe ohun kan ko tọ.
Or do not believe in it.	Tabi ma ṣe gbagbọ ninu rẹ.
Many who own this room know me.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ti o ni yara yi mọ mi.
I have more than a month to go.	Mo ni diẹ sii ju oṣu kan lọ lati lọ.
New hair makes me feel better.	Irun irun tuntun jẹ ki n dara.
It was such a great letter.	O je iru kan nla lẹta.
He is working with me to get me.	O n ṣiṣẹ pẹlu mi lati gba fun mi.
That is what we have to expect.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti a ni lati nireti.
And it is now or not.	Ati pe o jẹ bayi tabi rara.
A difficult environment, people come together.	Ayika ti o nira, eniyan wa papọ.
I need some time to leave.	Mo nilo akoko diẹ lati lọ kuro.
It is full of people.	O kun fun eniyan.
It’s very simple that way.	O rọrun pupọ ni ọna yẹn.
Something has to be wrong there.	Nkankan ni lati jẹ aṣiṣe nibẹ.
That should definitely help.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o ṣe iranlọwọ dajudaju.
Remember the old days.	Ranti awọn ọjọ atijọ.
They are here to kill us.	Wọn wa nibi lati pa wa.
And this is for a great reason.	Ati pe eyi jẹ fun idi nla.
I just don’t like it.	Emi ko fẹran rẹ nikan.
Some of it is something new, some of it is more than a year old.	Diẹ ninu rẹ jẹ nkan tuntun, diẹ ninu awọn ti ju ọdun kan lọ.
They are already here and love it.	Wọn ti wa nibi tẹlẹ ati fẹran rẹ.
It’s all for a reason.	Gbogbo rẹ jẹ fun idi kan.
He seems to have no trouble continuing now.	O dabi ẹni pe ko ni wahala lati tẹsiwaju ni bayi.
I will pay.	Emi yoo san.
This is dead.	Eyi ti ku.
I don't know.	Ko si mi mọ.
And bad news has appeared again.	Ati awọn iroyin buburu ti han lẹẹkansi.
Please contact me if you have any questions !.	Jọwọ kan si mi ti o ba ni ibeere eyikeyi!.
They build special programs to speed up the process.	Wọn kọ awọn eto pataki lati yara iṣẹ naa.
We look forward to hearing from you.	A nireti lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
In fact no one can.	Ni otitọ ko si ẹnikan ti o le.
Their work is fast.	Iṣẹ wọn yara.
We will never do that again.	A kii yoo tun ṣe bẹ lẹẹkansi.
This too is very nutritious.	Eyi paapaa jẹ ounjẹ pupọ.
He lives in the city.	O ngbe ni ilu.
I lost my mother two years ago.	Mo padanu iya mi ni ọdun meji sẹhin.
Some things we didn’t know until then.	Diẹ ninu awọn nkan ti a ko mọ titi di akoko yẹn.
The parties are essentially in agreement about what the law is.	Awọn ẹgbẹ jẹ pataki ni adehun nipa kini ofin jẹ.
You can wait.	O le duro.
Nothing about this water does not feel like water.	Nkankan nipa omi yii ko rilara bi omi.
We can be here.	A le wa nibi.
You may be interested in.	O le nifẹ ninu.
You are wrong.	O ni aṣiṣe.
Man cannot teach himself to say.	Eniyan ko le kọ ara rẹ lati sọ.
He was at a point he could not reach.	O wa ni aaye kan ti ko le de ọdọ.
I love your office.	Mo nifẹ si ọfiisi rẹ.
Our only song is our song.	Orin wa nikan ni orin wa.
It is one of the.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn.
But you want to take the right path.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ mu ọna ti o tọ.
Look inside you, no one there, nothing there.	Wo inu rẹ, ko si ẹnikan nibẹ, ko si nkankan nibẹ.
There is nothing good about it.	Ko si ohun ti o dara nipa rẹ.
To tell you the truth, he left a lot.	Lati sọ otitọ fun ọ, o fi ọpọlọpọ silẹ.
I want everything.	Mo fẹ ohun gbogbo.
That is an idea.	Iyẹn jẹ ero kan.
He wants to do it on his own.	O fe lati ṣe awọn ti o lori ara rẹ.
Find the cat.	Wa ologbo naa.
Not much out.	Ko jade pupọ.
He left me with this.	O fi mi silẹ pẹlu eyi.
I know something.	Mo mọ nkan.
He lived harder than most of us ever.	O gbe ni lile ju ọpọlọpọ wa lọ lailai.
The rules were legal.	Awọn ofin wà ofin.
Not what you expect to hear.	Kii ṣe ohun ti o nireti lati gbọ.
Remember the past is important.	Ranti ohun ti o ti kọja jẹ pataki.
He was a very good student in high school.	O jẹ ọmọ ile-iwe ti o dara julọ ni ile-iwe giga.
I don’t keep money like that on hand.	Emi ko tọju owo bi iyẹn si ọwọ.
I can say you're sorry.	Mo le so pe o binu.
Don’t change or bad things will happen.	Maṣe yi pada tabi awọn ohun buburu yoo ṣẹlẹ.
When it rains.	Nigbati ojo ba ro.
He read many children's books.	O ka ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe ọmọ.
It looks like a great tool.	O dabi ohun elo nla kan.
Even good music.	Orin to dara paapaa.
I will be a personal gift because of your love for me.	Emi yoo jẹ ẹbun ti ara ẹni nitori ifẹ si ọ.
I will be back early in the morning.	Emi yoo pada wa ni kutukutu owurọ.
He has been in this position for a long time.	O wa ni ipo yii fun igba pipẹ.
This seems to be the right way to proceed.	Eyi dabi pe o jẹ ọna ti o yẹ lati tẹsiwaju.
He is no longer in love with her.	Ko si ni ife pẹlu rẹ mọ.
Maybe you should explain.	Boya o yẹ ki o ṣe alaye.
It's really amazing.	O jẹ iyalẹnu gaan.
He has a wonderful wife and many children as well.	O ni iyawo iyanu ati ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọ pẹlu.
This painting is a work of art.	Aworan yi jẹ iṣẹ ọna.
Temperatures today will open tomorrow.	Awọn ipo otutu loni yoo ṣii ni ọla.
I will leave with this.	Emi yoo lọ kuro pẹlu eyi.
They have done great things.	Wọn ti ṣe ohun nla.
Not so, for two reasons.	Ko ri bẹ, fun idi meji.
She really loves this and wants more.	O nifẹ eyi gaan ati pe o fẹ diẹ sii.
They refused to talk to me after that.	Wọn kọ lati ba mi sọrọ lẹhin iyẹn.
I am interested in the way it is.	Mo nifẹ ninu ọna wo.
Both will hate it.	Awọn mejeeji yoo korira rẹ.
The test becomes easier.	Idanwo di rọrun.
They are amazing.	Wọn jẹ iyalẹnu.
You have spoken about this by letter.	O ti sọ nipa eyi nipasẹ lẹta.
We will leave in an hour.	A yoo lọ kuro ni wakati kan.
But they didn’t notice, that’s the point.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko ṣe akiyesi, iyẹn ni aaye naa.
And you want what you want.	Ati pe o fẹ ohun ti o fẹ.
Maybe things will get better and maybe they won’t.	Boya ohun yoo dara ati boya wọn kii yoo.
In a moment, the reason left him.	Ni akoko diẹ, idi fi i silẹ.
Tell the driver to pull out at the station.	Sọ fun awakọ lati fa jade ni ibudo naa.
To decide if this is the best job for your business.	Lati pinnu boya eyi ni iṣẹ ti o dara julọ fun iṣẹ rẹ.
Just get started.	O kan bẹrẹ.
He was very human.	O jẹ eniyan pupọ.
But they could not find.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko le ri.
It is well received.	O ti gba daradara.
I let you make decisions.	Mo jẹ ki o ṣe awọn ipinnu.
Most people do two jobs.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ṣe awọn iṣẹ meji.
I have enough to eat.	Mo ni wọn jẹun to.
His head hit.	Ori rẹ lu.
Tom is looking for a new job.	Tom n wa iṣẹ tuntun kan.
You have to take the news to me.	O ni lati ya iroyin naa fun mi.
I started to notice things.	Mo bẹrẹ lati ṣe akiyesi awọn nkan.
That is not an application here.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun elo nibi.
It is good to remember our story.	O dara lati ranti itan wa.
You can't sleep, he said.	O ko le sun, o sọ.
But they did not stop there.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko duro nibẹ.
These are important.	Awọn wọnyi ni pataki.
He gave me life.	O fun mi ni aye.
I will do my best.	Emi yoo ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
He picked it up and stood up.	O gbe mọ o si dide.
Just think it.	O kan ro o.
We should.	A gbọdọ.
He wants to explain something to you.	O fe lati se alaye nkankan fun o.
I like words.	Mo feran ọrọ.
I'll find the money.	Emi yoo wa owo naa.
What, if anything, is wrong?	Kini, ti ohunkohun, jẹ aṣiṣe?
I hope it makes you laugh a little.	Mo nireti pe o jẹ ki o rẹrin diẹ.
He does not know.	Ko mọ ọ.
He and I went back a long way.	Oun ati emi pada si ọna pipẹ.
At least for a while.	O kere ju fun akoko kan.
I have to tell you, they are not very good.	Mo ni lati sọ fun ọ, wọn ko dara pupọ.
That also hurts.	Iyẹn tun ṣe ipalara.
Nothing can be allowed to go wrong with this agreement.	Ko si ohun ti o le gba laaye lati lọ si aṣiṣe pẹlu adehun yii.
At first the suspect was removed.	Ni igba akọkọ ti fura kuro.
They have been made to last for years.	Wọn ti ṣe lati ṣiṣe fun ọdun.
It also makes me feel like I’m not perfect.	O tun jẹ ki n lero pe emi ko pe.
For some reason it does not work.	Fun idi kan ko ṣiṣẹ.
Read several times.	Ka ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
I made a loaf of bread.	Mo ṣe akara kan.
One is a machine.	Ọkan jẹ ẹrọ.
Some work is included.	Diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ wa pẹlu.
Without water, there is no life.	Laisi omi, ko si aye.
Please just see me.	Jọwọ kan ri mi.
We started to learn how to write songs.	A bẹrẹ lati ko bi lati kọ awọn orin.
That's all.	Iyẹn nikan ni.
You don't see anything like that.	O ko ri nkankan bi wipe.
It’s about the whole company.	O jẹ nipa gbogbo ile-iṣẹ.
My strength returned.	Agbara mi pada.
They will have to eat.	Wọn yoo ni lati jẹ.
To make sure you hear and understand what you are saying.	Lati rii daju pe o gbọ ati loye ohun ti o n sọ.

There is no better person to take from me than me.	Ko si eniyan ti o dara julọ lati gba lọwọ mi ju mi ​​lọ.
I'll be back soon.	Emi yoo pada wa ni igba diẹ.
And everywhere.	Ati nibi gbogbo.

Why he took it with him, does not know.	Kini idi ti o fi mu pẹlu rẹ, ko mọ.
It was two other people.	O je meji miiran eniyan.
It is necessary.	O ṣe pataki.
She ran her hand through her hair.	O ran ọwọ rẹ nipasẹ irun ori rẹ.
Everyone knows it there.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ rẹ nibẹ.
Children do this many times.	Awọn ọmọde ṣe eyi ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
Any other ideas get in the way.	Eyikeyi miiran ero gba ni ọna.
He knew he was not alone.	O mọ pe kii ṣe oun nikan.
They were such wonderful moments.	Wọn jẹ awọn akoko iyanu bẹ.
You understand very well.	O loye daradara.
And we have our child.	Ati pe a ni ọmọ wa.
His work does not seem to be enough.	Iṣẹ rẹ ko dabi pe o to.
The puppy does not have much food.	Ọmọ aja naa ko ni ounjẹ pupọ.
We are not born.	A ko bi o.
I will need a long break.	Emi yoo nilo isinmi pipẹ.
He used to have it when he was a child.	O lo lati ni nigbati o jẹ ọmọde.
But that’s more important.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ṣe pataki diẹ.
Or just put it on yourself.	Tabi o kan fi si ara rẹ.
Please, enjoy yourself.	Jọwọ, gbadun ara rẹ.
I can't just go back to that place.	Emi ko le kan pada si ibi yẹn.
Everything they had, they lost.	Ohun gbogbo ti wọn ni, wọn padanu.
How long can you go without water?	Bawo ni pipẹ ti o le lọ laisi omi?
I thought so, too.	Mo ro bẹ, ju.
It could be anyone it could be.	O le jẹ ẹnikẹni ti o le jẹ.
You do not need this.	O ko nilo eyi.
He fulfilled his promise.	O pari ileri rẹ.
People are everywhere.	Awon eniyan wa nibi gbogbo.
We love it and we are here for you.	A nifẹ rẹ ati pe a wa nibi fun ọ.
What works for some people may not work for others.	Ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ fun diẹ ninu awọn eniyan le ma ṣiṣẹ fun awọn miiran.
I went to see it.	Mo lọ wo o.
Even these guys know a lot about their jobs.	Paapaa awọn ọmọkunrin wọnyi mọ pupọ nipa awọn iṣẹ wọn.
This is not a fire issue.	Eyi kii ṣe ọrọ ina.
And wear your new outfit.	Ati ki o wọ aṣọ tuntun rẹ.
You don't need it.	Ko nilo rẹ.
No back seats.	Ko si awọn ijoko ẹhin.
This is the right thing to do.	Eleyi jẹ ohun ti o tọ.
It is not my test.	Kii ṣe idanwo mi.
The right one will come at a good time.	Eyi ti o tọ yoo wa ni akoko ti o dara.
This is done now.	Eyi ti ṣe ni bayi.
It looks good.	O ri pe o dara.
You have seen what He has done to us.	O ti ri ohun ti o ṣe si wa.
They laughed to good.	Wọn rẹrin lati dara.
The light coat will wear.	Aṣọ ina naa yoo wọ.
Everyone continues with their lives.	Gbogbo eniyan n tẹsiwaju pẹlu igbesi aye wọn.
For that, it is a question.	Fun iyẹn, o jẹ ibeere kan.
Okay let me help you with that.	O dara jẹ ki n ran ọ lọwọ pẹlu iyẹn.
He knew it could not happen.	O mọ pe ko le ṣẹlẹ.
As you can see, this is a big house.	Bi o ti le ri, eyi jẹ ile nla kan.
You can take whatever you want.	O le ya ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
By this, he is convinced.	Nipa eyi, o ni idaniloju.
But maybe it was enough.	Sugbon boya o je to.
He came to see me today.	O wa ri mi loni.
You didn’t even think about it.	Ti o ko paapaa ronu nipa rẹ.
I haven’t seen one, you know.	Emi ko tii ri ọkan, o mọ.
It will let everyone know when that changes.	Yoo jẹ ki gbogbo eniyan mọ nigbati iyẹn yipada.
We think we do.	A ro pe a ṣe.
You can get your food in a minute.	O le gba ounjẹ rẹ ni iṣẹju kan.
I really like my bed.	Mo feran ibusun mi gaan.
This has to be included.	Eyi ni lati ni ninu.
You never know where you'll end up.	O ko mọ ibiti iwọ yoo pari.
But no.	Ṣugbọn ko si.
There are.	Nibẹ ni o wa.
Dogs are the best friend of man.	Awọn aja jẹ ọrẹ to dara julọ ti eniyan.
I am not interesting.	Emi ko awon.
He told me to get up.	O so fun mi lati dide.
There is so much work to be done.	Iṣẹ pupọ wa lati ṣe.
Everyone wants all that.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ gbogbo iyẹn.
I think that's right.	Mo ro pe iyẹn tọ.
How much time they have left.	Elo akoko ti wọn ti fi silẹ.
Don’t give them something, not something.	Maṣe fun wọn ni ohun kan, kii ṣe nkan kan.
I decided to try it, here and now.	Mo pinnu lati gbiyanju rẹ, nibi ati bayi.
It was not the weather.	O je ko ni oju ojo.
He lives with his father.	O ngbe pẹlu baba rẹ.
But do not be afraid.	Ṣugbọn maṣe bẹru.
I want people to know that we love this.	Mo fe ki awon eniyan mo wipe a ni ife yi.
Love that you are here.	Ifẹ pe o wa nibi.
Some make books.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣe awọn iwe.
If nothing happens, good to go.	Ti ohunkohun ko ba ṣẹlẹ, o dara lati lọ.
This was his thing of course.	Eleyi je rẹ ohun dajudaju.
Too much sometimes, he thought.	Pupọ pupọ nigba miiran, o ronu.
It is early morning and cold.	O ni kutukutu owurọ ati otutu.
The car veered off the road and hit a tree.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ lọ kuro ni opopona o si lu igi kan.
He met her.	O pade rẹ.
But that may be easier said than done.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn le rọrun lati sọ ju ṣiṣe lọ.
Okay, some of them.	O dara, diẹ ninu wọn.
He is bringing us back.	O n mu wa pada.
You haven't seen him for a week.	O ti ko ri i fun ọsẹ kan.
But on the other hand, they are the same.	Ṣugbọn ni ọna miiran, wọn jẹ kanna.
He wants to do everything.	O fe lati se ohun gbogbo.
My eyes are always on me.	Oju mi ​​fun mi ni gbogbo igba.
When the time comes, of course.	Nigbati akoko ba de, dajudaju.
But this does not help.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko ṣe iranlọwọ.
They hurt a lot to move.	Wọn ṣe ipalara pupọ lati gbe.
He is starting to get back now.	O ti bẹrẹ lati gba pada ni bayi.
And some places may not always be available.	Ati diẹ ninu awọn aaye le ma wa nigbagbogbo.
There is no group.	Ko si ẹgbẹ kan.
They do not want to meet anyone.	Wọn ko fẹ lati pade ẹnikẹni.
But those very old books.	Sugbon awon gan atijọ iwe.
I don’t think this through.	Emi ko ronu eyi nipasẹ.
Every year, things happen.	Ni gbogbo ọdun, awọn nkan ṣẹlẹ.
You understand why they don’t.	O loye idi ti wọn ko ṣe.
Working on children.	Ṣiṣẹ lori awọn ọmọde.
Does not sit well with many families.	Ko joko daradara pẹlu ọpọlọpọ awọn idile.
Either way, it’s probably the best.	Ni ọna kan, o ṣee ṣe dara julọ.
Nothing came out of it.	Ko si ohun ti jade ni rẹ.
It always comes from the bottom on the top.	O nigbagbogbo wa lati isalẹ lori oke.
But her meeting changed her life and herself.	Ṣugbọn ipade rẹ ti yi aye ati ara rẹ pada.
I have come a long way.	Mo ti wa ọna pipẹ bẹ.
We feel we've caught it on our own.	A lero a ti sọ mu o lori ara wa.
We went with him to see.	A lọ pẹlu rẹ lati wo.
You must know about the phone by now.	O gbọdọ mọ nipa foonu nipasẹ bayi.
The mother knew the time was coming.	Iya naa mọ pe akoko n bọ.
He said it was great.	O sọ pe o dara julọ.
It has a name.	O ni orukọ kan.
I look around.	Mo wo ni ayika.
I missed him that night.	Mo padanu rẹ ni alẹ yẹn.
But, he said, there is more.	Ṣugbọn, o sọ pe, diẹ sii wa.
I am very happy and happy for you.	Inu mi dun pupọ, inu mi si dun fun ọ.
You have to sell them out.	O ni lati ta wọn jade.
You never know how to deal with that reality.	O ko mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe pẹlu otitọ yẹn.
They can do something else in life.	Wọn le ṣe nkan miiran ni igbesi aye.
Either way you missed it.	Ọna boya o padanu.
I never get to use it again before bed.	Emi ko gba lati lo lẹẹkansi ṣaaju ibusun.
It will not always be possible.	Nigbagbogbo kii yoo ṣee ṣe.
It keeps them out of our mountains.	O pa wọn mọ kuro ninu awọn oke wa.
The sister did not like the way he was talking, he waited for her.	Arabinrin naa ko fẹran bi o ṣe n sọrọ, o duro de ọdọ rẹ.
Bad news does that.	Awọn iroyin buburu ṣe iyẹn.
You have touched the right places here.	O ti fi ọwọ kan awọn aaye to dara nibi.
The sister has not worked completely lately.	Arabinrin ko ṣiṣẹ patapata laipẹ.
You made a mistake, the mistake is dead.	O ṣe aṣiṣe, aṣiṣe ti ku.
But it is too late to forget the past completely.	Ṣugbọn o ti pẹ pupọ lati gbagbe ohun ti o kọja patapata.
Be in two or three places at a time.	Wa ni awọn aaye meji tabi mẹta ni akoko kan.
And something happened.	Ati ohun kan ṣẹlẹ.
Now not so.	Bayi ko ri bẹ.
But he did not.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe bẹ.
This is a difficult question.	Eyi jẹ ibeere ti o nira.
Nothing is in place until everything is in place.	Ko si ohun ti o wa ni ipo titi ohun gbogbo yoo wa ni ipo.
He was alone.	O je nikan.
But this does not need to be.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko nilo bẹ.
Tomorrow is the big day.	Ọla ni ọjọ nla.
Not everyone wants to hear the stories.	Kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan fẹ lati gbọ awọn itan naa.
Enough to last a month.	Ni to lati ṣiṣe ni oṣu kan.
There is a hand on top.	Ọwọ kan wa lori oke.
Not up here.	Ko soke nibi.
But the big days are gone.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọjọ nla ti lọ.
Or so we can insert.	Tabi ki a le fi sii.
That is the point.	Iyẹn ni aaye yii jẹ fun gaan.
He’s telling me he’s broken.	O n sọ fun mi pe o ti fọ.
People can also live in the water.	Awọn eniyan tun le gbe inu omi.
But they are in the area now.	Ṣugbọn wọn wa ni agbegbe ni bayi.
There are other things you need.	Awọn nkan miiran wa ti o nilo.
Her brother did not know better.	Arakunrin rẹ ko mọ dara julọ.
A fo kuro.	A fo kuro.
You 'read' the thing well.	O 'ka' nkan naa daradara.
I really enjoyed testing this material.	Mo gbadun pupọ lati ṣe idanwo nkan elo yii.
The journey continues.	Irin-ajo naa tẹsiwaju.
But don’t let anything throw you out of your game.	Ṣugbọn maṣe jẹ ki ohunkohun ju ọ kuro ninu ere rẹ.
We didn’t think we were going to get married.	A ko ro pe a yoo ṣe igbeyawo.
They open.	Wọn ṣii.
I know what the truth is.	Mo mọ kini otitọ jẹ.
I left my phone in the car.	Mo fi foonu mi silẹ ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
We have some questions.	A ni diẹ ninu awọn ibeere.
You have to stop here.	O ni lati da nibi.
I want to be serious.	Mo fẹ lati ṣe pataki.
Okay, that's not possible.	O dara, iyẹn ko le.
Where you need to be.	Ibi ti o nilo lati wa.
You have to do both.	O ni lati ṣe awọn mejeeji.
He raised his hand.	O gbe ọwọ rẹ soke.
I asked him why he changed.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ idi ti o fi yipada.
Bi a.	Bi a .
There was some trouble.	Nibẹ wà diẹ ninu awọn wahala.
If used, it would have reached your office.	Ti o ba ti lo, yoo ti de ọfiisi rẹ.
It is a valid question.	O jẹ ibeere ti o tọ.
They do not expect to reach high altitudes.	Wọn ko nireti lati de awọn giga giga.
She always left her baby.	O fi ọmọ rẹ silẹ nigbagbogbo.
I think they had a very good year.	Mo ro pe wọn ni ọdun ti o dara pupọ.
But they let their music be good, and it sounded good.	Ṣugbọn wọn jẹ ki orin wọn dara, ati pe o dun daradara.
It seems to be very small in power.	O dabi ẹni pe o kere pupọ ni agbara.
He said he knew the plane to go.	O sọ pe o mọ ọkọ ofurufu lati lọ.
I have to think of the future.	Mo ni lati ronu ti ojo iwaju.
Please just move a few more days.	Jọwọ kan gbe awọn ọjọ diẹ diẹ sii.
Everything else has to go.	Gbogbo ohun miiran ni lati lọ.
He has brought her to this point, this woman.	O ti mu u de aaye yii, obinrin yii.
And not just here.	Ati ki o ko nikan nibi.
Remember, he said he saw it killed.	Ranti, o sọ pe o rii pe o pa.
This report has been received from all sites.	Yi iroyin ti o ti a ni lati gbogbo awọn aaye gba.
I pull out and let you have it.	Mo fa jade ki o si jẹ ki o ni o.
You want this.	O fẹ eyi.
Maybe not.	Boya ko le.
He will hit.	Oun yoo lu.
This is a perfect decision.	Eyi jẹ ipinnu ti o pe.
He didn't seem to see me.	O dabi pe ko ri mi.
I have to deal with less.	Mo ni lati ṣe pẹlu kere si.
Turn off the power supply.	Pa ọna agbara.
If you are getting people out, it works.	Ti o ba n gba awọn eniyan jade, o ṣiṣẹ.
Some men accept buying from other men.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọkunrin gba ifẹ si awọn ọkunrin miiran.
This whole thing is new.	Gbogbo nkan yii jẹ tuntun.
They have not reached a decision.	Wọn ko ti de ipinnu kan.
I think you will enjoy it too.	Mo ro pe iwọ yoo gbadun rẹ paapaa.
And you can do this outside the sun.	Ati pe o le ṣe eyi ni ita oorun.
So he was angry.	Nitorina o binu.
Right now, there are a few of them, one or two.	Ni bayi, diẹ ni o wa ninu wọn, ọkan tabi meji.
It felt really good.	O ro gan ti o dara.
Of course he was not already there.	Dajudaju oun ko ti wa nibẹ tẹlẹ.
That is what they are calling.	Ohun ti won n pe niyen.
Or better yet, look at it all the time.	Tabi dara julọ sibẹsibẹ, wo gbogbo akoko naa.
I do not know why you can not just live together.	Emi ko mọ idi ti o ko le kan gbe papọ.
There is no question in my mind.	Ko si ibeere ninu ọkan mi.
It takes a few minutes.	O gba to iṣẹju diẹ.
I just want to die.	Mo kan fe ku.
If anything, it looks like they are enjoying it.	Ti o ba jẹ ohunkohun, o dabi pe wọn n gbadun rẹ.
Probably me too.	O ṣee ṣe ki emi naa wa.
But it's not going to get any better.	Sugbon o ti n ko lilọ lati gba eyikeyi dara.
His head turned under his arm.	Ori rẹ yipada labẹ ọwọ rẹ.
I'm not sure where to start.	Emi ko ni idaniloju ibiti o ti bẹrẹ.
I will send a text to you.	Emi yoo fi ọrọ ranṣẹ si ọ.
I really enjoyed my time there.	Mo gbadun akoko mi nibẹ gaan.
He hopes some help will come from outside.	O nireti pe iranlọwọ kan yoo wa lati ita.
And it may not have been.	Ati pe o le ma ti wa.
Or at least in error.	Tabi o kere ju ni aṣiṣe.
It was something to see.	O jẹ nkan lati rii.
One reason should keep your boys up for dates.	Idi kan yẹ ki o mu awọn ọmọkunrin rẹ soke fun awọn ọjọ.
You don’t notice.	O ko ṣe akiyesi.
I thought nothing of it.	Mo ro ohunkohun ti o.
Will you be with me?	Ṣe iwọ yoo wa pẹlu mi?
It almost seems impossible to do.	O fẹrẹ dabi pe o han gbangba lati ma ṣe.
I'm glad you came.	Inu mi dun pe o ti wa.
Sleep as long as you can.	Sun bi pẹ bi o ṣe le.
It's making up.	O n ṣe soke.
Make no mistake, that’s what it is.	Maṣe ṣe aṣiṣe, iyẹn ni ohun ti o jẹ.
Let them explain.	Jẹ ki wọn ṣe alaye.
How soon can you leave?	Bawo ni kete ti o le lọ kuro?
This will cost money.	Eyi yoo gba owo.
Which we will have.	Eyi ti a yoo ni.
How can you not like it ?.	Bawo ni o ṣe le ko fẹran rẹ?.
But he did not listen.	Ṣugbọn o ko gbọ.
Little boy, should be able to climb up well.	Ọmọkunrin kekere, yẹ ki o ni anfani lati gun oke daradara.
We are called to tell the truth.	A pe wa lati sọ otitọ.
The world is the world.	Aye jẹ aye.
I started to worry about my own cats.	Mo bẹrẹ lati ṣe aniyan nipa ologbo ti ara mi.
There is an advantage.	Anfani rẹ wa.
There is nothing to be found.	Ko si nkankan lati wa.
I don’t know if that’s the right word.	Emi ko mọ boya iyẹn ni ọrọ to tọ.
Where should we go today?	Nibo ni o yẹ ki a lọ loni?
It has nothing to do with money and power.	Ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu owo ati agbara.
I had to make a decision.	Mo ni lati ṣe ipinnu.
Applications received after the deadline will not be planned.	Awọn ohun elo ti o gba lẹhin ọjọ ipari ko ni gbero.
That was hard on him and he almost lost everything.	Ti jẹ lile lori rẹ ati pe o fẹrẹ padanu ohun gbogbo.
We are here for one thing.	A wa nibi fun ohun kan.
Don't be angry with me.	Maṣe binu mi.
He had no home, no family, no people.	Ko ni ile, ko si ebi, ko si eniyan.
Jobs should be for people.	Awọn iṣẹ yẹ ki o wa fun awọn eniyan.
But we do not know.	Ṣugbọn a ko mọ.
Help someone out.	Ṣe iranlọwọ eniyan kan jade.
Please help me with my box, please.	Jọwọ ran mi lọwọ pẹlu apoti mi, jọwọ.
Wait for a while.	Duro fun igba diẹ.
He spoke in words they did not understand.	O sọ ninu awọn ọrọ ti wọn ko loye.
Police have arrested the boy.	Awọn ọlọpa ti mu ọmọkunrin naa.
It seems like everyone used to work in one room.	O dabi pe gbogbo eniyan lo lati ṣiṣẹ ni yara kan.
They have the whole city for themselves.	Wọn ni gbogbo ilu fun ara wọn.
So it’s time to rewrite them.	Nitorina o ni akoko lati tun wọn kọ.
Kill myself in it.	Pa ara mi ninu rẹ.
He looked at his hand again.	O tun wo ọwọ rẹ lẹẹkansi.
It's almost sweet.	O fẹrẹ dun.
I am making good money.	Mo n ṣe owo ti o dara.
He walks down the street.	O rin ni opopona.
They have become a group.	Wọn ti di ẹgbẹ kan.
So the water was turned off.	Nitorina a pa omi naa.
My eyes about it.	Oju ti mi nipa re.
You have to look at things the right way.	O ni lati wo awọn nkan ni ọna ti o tọ.
Something around town.	Nkan ni ayika ilu.
That is not my job.	Iyẹn kii ṣe iṣẹ mi.
These songs, their stories, come from life.	Awọn orin wọnyi, awọn itan wọn, wa lati igbesi aye.
He stopped her for a few minutes.	O mu u duro fun iṣẹju diẹ.
I like that.	Mo fẹ iyẹn.
You don’t have to talk until one.	O ko ni lati sọrọ titi di ọkan.
Do nothing, for some days.	Maṣe ṣe ohunkohun, fun diẹ ninu awọn ọjọ.
But my mother died from it and my sister had it.	Ṣugbọn iya mi ku lati rẹ ati arabinrin mi ni o.
The device is turned off.	A pa ẹrọ naa.
The higher the better.	Ti o ga julọ dara julọ.
This is not the best.	Eyi ko dara ju.
In the end it did something to me.	Ni ipari o ṣe nkankan si mi.
But it took three years to forget yours.	Ṣugbọn o gba ọdun mẹta lati gbagbe tirẹ.
He is my best friend.	Oun ni ọrẹ mi to dara julọ.
In front is a clear space.	Ni iwaju ni aaye ti o han gbangba.
The only word you can come up with.	Ọrọ nikan ti o le wa pẹlu.
And they get them.	Ati pe wọn gba wọn.
Use your ingenuity, he said.	Lo ọgbọn rẹ, o sọ.
Some years we did not get any rain, others we had a lot.	Awọn ọdun diẹ ti a ko gba eyikeyi ojo, awọn miiran a ni pupọ.
He will stay here, with me.	Oun yoo duro nibi, pẹlu mi.
You can not do anything.	O ko le ṣe nkan kan.
I love everyone at home.	Mo nifẹ gbogbo eniyan ni ile.
There is nothing to fear.	Ko ṣe nkankan lati bẹru.
This test is difficult to meet.	Idanwo yii nira lati pade.
I have a job for you.	Mo ni ise fun o.
Can't think of that right now.	Ko le ronu nipa iyẹn ni bayi.
He liked that.	O feran iyẹn.
The fathers have come, but not yours.	Awọn baba ti de, ṣugbọn kii ṣe tirẹ.
The back space is the teacher area.	Aaye ti o wa ni ẹhin ni agbegbe olukọ.
Let me know how much you need.	Jẹ ki mi mọ iye ti o nilo.
You do not want to die alone.	Iwọ ko fẹ lati ku nikan.
This will be your story.	Eyi yoo jẹ itan rẹ.
He has nothing to say.	Ko ni nkankan lati sọ.
I know a doctor.	Mo mọ dokita kan.
But it is something.	Sugbon o jẹ nkankan.
And he did.	Ati pe o ṣe.
He celebrated the occasion.	O ṣe ayẹyẹ naa.
I have been walking for a very long time.	Mo ti n rin fun igba pipẹ pupọ.
It just has to be possible.	O kan gbọdọ jẹ o ṣeeṣe.
The dog will know.	Aja yoo mọ.
We can handle that.	A le mu iyẹn.
They are in the obvious error.	Wọn wa ninu aṣiṣe ti o han gbangba.
He stopped as he looked me in the eye for something.	O duro bi o ti n wa oju mi ​​fun nkan kan.
You all return to your place.	Gbogbo yin pada si aaye yin.
There is one.	Eyi kan wa.
Anyone can make a mistake.	Ẹnikẹni le ṣe aṣiṣe.
Some of us probably won’t.	Diẹ ninu wa jasi yoo ko.
For a week we were in town.	Fun ọsẹ kan a wà ilu.
It will not be used for any other purpose.	Ko ni lo idi miiran.
I think what it is.	Mo ro pe ohun ti o jẹ.
That sounds high.	Iyẹn dabi pe o ga.
I want to start this.	Mo fẹ lati bẹrẹ eyi.
Let's go back to the others.	Jẹ ki a pada si awọn miiran.
It would be a mistake not to.	Yoo jẹ aṣiṣe lati ma ṣe.
You can do it with a little rest.	O le ṣe pẹlu isinmi diẹ.
They want to be something they are not.	Wọn fẹ lati jẹ nkan ti wọn kii ṣe.
Not much is happening.	Ko pupo ti n ṣẹlẹ.
Nothing.	Ko si nkankan.
You have one and there is no one better.	O ni ọkan ati pe ko si ọkan ti o dara julọ.
You want to do it again and again.	O fẹ lati ṣe lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
I visited one of them today.	Mo ṣabẹwo si ọkan ninu wọn loni.
He refuses to talk about it.	O kọ lati sọrọ nipa rẹ.
It started this way.	O bẹrẹ si ọna yii.
This is what we find in our teachings.	Eyi ni ohun ti a rii ninu awọn ẹkọ wa.
So we were surprised and, of course, very happy.	Nitorina iyalẹnu wa ati, dajudaju, dun pupọ.
Obviously to show them.	O han ni lati fi wọn han.
Act like a man.	Ṣe bi ọkunrin.
The woman was killed while we were there.	A pa obinrin naa nigba ti a wa.
However he said nothing.	Sibẹsibẹ ko sọ nkankan.
This conclusion, of course, is wrong.	Ipari yii, dajudaju, jẹ aṣiṣe.
My mother's brother.	Arakunrin iya mi.
Not around all day.	Ko wa ni ayika ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Better after an accident than ever before.	Dara lẹhin ijamba ju lailai.
But if you have made a mistake.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba ti ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
You can read the letter here.	O le ka lẹta naa nibi.
Everyone needs a car today!	Gbogbo eniyan nilo ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan loni!
The key word, however, seems.	Ọrọ bọtini, sibẹsibẹ, dabi.
I am not here to speak, but to hear you speak.	Emi ko wa nibi lati ba sọrọ, ṣugbọn lati gbọ ti o ba sọrọ.
Do not change anything.	Maṣe yi ohunkohun pada.
This may continue for hours however.	Eyi le tẹsiwaju fun awọn wakati sibẹsibẹ.
But you know what people are saying.	Ṣugbọn o mọ ohun ti eniyan n sọ.
Just this.	O kan yii.
These people want nothing from you.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi ko fẹ nkankan lati ọdọ rẹ.
Now that area is gone.	Bayi ti agbegbe ti lọ.
I just want to let you know.	Mo kan fẹ lati jẹ ki o mọ.
I am making a wish.	Mo n ṣe ifẹ kan.
Rain after tomorrow.	Ojo lẹhin ọla.
It's too hot.	O gbona pupo.
Now my mental problems started.	Bayi awọn iṣoro ero inu mi bẹrẹ.
It was done for the day.	O ti ṣe fun ọjọ naa.
We are on the site.	A wa lori aaye naa.

He will think about that issue next time.	Oun yoo ronu lori ọrọ yẹn ni akoko miiran.
She ate well.	O jẹun daradara.
People may have to think a little more.	Awọn eniyan le ni lati ronu diẹ diẹ sii.
He quit his job and went up.	O fi iṣẹ rẹ silẹ o si lọ soke.
The doctor will try to determine the cause of the problem.	Dokita yoo gbiyanju lati mọ idi ti iṣoro naa.
But it doesn’t work the other way around.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣiṣẹ ni ọna miiran ni ayika.
Has anyone seen it?	Njẹ ẹnikan ti ri i bi?
This is a fun way to get back to them.	Eyi jẹ ọna ti o nifẹ lati pada si wọn.
They know you love it so it’s best to invite others.	Wọn mọ pe o nifẹ nitorina o dara julọ lati pe awọn miiran.
That’s not a big surprise.	Iyẹn kii ṣe iyalẹnu nla.
Let them eat.	Jẹ ki o jẹ wọn.
But that is the simplest situation.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ni ipo ti o rọrun julọ.
They are not written.	A ko kọ wọn.
No need for further tests.	Ko nilo fun awọn idanwo diẹ sii.
Nothing will seem to come up.	Ko si ohun ti yoo dabi lati wa soke.
There is such a situation here.	Iru ipo kan wa nibi.
Not a good one, a great one.	Ko kan ti o dara, nla kan.
Let it work.	Jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
Under it is still so much.	Labẹ o jẹ ṣi ki Elo.
He slapped his hand on the table.	O si lu ọwọ rẹ lori tabili.
I understand now.	Mo loye bayi.
There is so much room for you !.	Yara pupọ wa fun ọ!.
We will have questions on the way back, for now.	A yoo ni awọn ibeere ni ọna pada, ni bayi.
Some things have not changed, it seems.	Diẹ ninu awọn ohun ko yipada, o dabi.
I searched your site and thought your work was helpful.	Mo wa aaye rẹ ati ro pe iṣẹ rẹ jẹ iranlọwọ.
I know he was born for this.	Mo mọ pe a bi i fun eyi.
This will not always be true of other games, however.	Eyi kii yoo jẹ otitọ nigbagbogbo ti awọn ere miiran, sibẹsibẹ.
Good here.	O dara nibi.
I decided to leave.	Mo pinnu lati lọ kuro.
Renew your energy.	Tun agbara rẹ kun.
But they feel there is something in it.	Ṣugbọn wọn lero pe ohun kan wa ninu rẹ.
He will just leave.	Oun yoo kan lọ kuro.
It was just money.	O je o kan owo.
The problem is, they are not.	Iṣoro naa ni, wọn kii ṣe rara.
Now you know what it is.	Bayi o mọ ohun ti o jẹ.
Do you like this outfit?	Ṣe o fẹran aṣọ yii?
Last night, before the world ended.	Ni alẹ ana, ṣaaju ki aye to pari.
We will update them soon.	A yoo tun wọn ṣe laipẹ.
Should not be accepted, need not be appropriate.	Ko yẹ ki o gba, ko nilo ko yẹ.
Maybe you can give it to everyone.	O ṣee ṣe pe o le fun gbogbo eniyan.
If you are.	Ti o ba wa.
I will cook at home, he said.	Emi yoo se ounjẹ ni ile, o sọ.
We don’t have much testing anymore.	A ko ni idanwo pupọ mọ.
It goes through a lot of things.	O n lọ nipasẹ ọpọlọpọ nkan.
Neither seems to work.	Bẹni ko dabi lati ṣiṣẹ.
You do not want to become.	O ko fẹ lati di.
See text for details.	Wo ọrọ fun alaye.
And you are right.	Ati pe o tọ.
You know how to tell this story.	O mọ bi o ṣe le sọ itan yii.
The two met a few days ago.	Awọn mejeeji pade ni ọjọ diẹ sẹhin.
I would like to do so again.	Emi yoo fẹ lati tun ṣe bẹ.
This device has the ability to operate underwater.	Ẹrọ yii ni agbara lati ṣiṣẹ labẹ omi.
I think they tried to do so.	Mo ro pe wọn gbiyanju lati ṣe bẹ.
Something is wrong here.	Nkankan ni aṣiṣe nibi.
It made my day at that time.	O ṣe ọjọ mi ni akoko yẹn.
There is an office building down the road.	Ile-iṣẹ ile-iṣẹ kan wa ni isalẹ ọna naa.
I work all day.	Mo ṣiṣẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
But that is not right.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko tọ.
This is a mistake.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe kan.
You just can't beat it.	O kan ko le lu o.
There is so much to learn.	Pupọ wa lati kọ ẹkọ.
Let's just talk.	Jẹ ki a kan sọrọ.
I hope you are at home and feeling better than ever.	Mo nireti pe o wa ni ile ati rilara ti o dara ju lailai.
There does not have to be.	Nibẹ ko ni lati wa.
Do not kill me.	Maṣe pa mi.
I have never heard of it.	Emi ko tii gbọ rẹ rara.
However, this issue has dropped.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọrọ yii ti lọ silẹ.
You can still feel it.	O tun le lero rẹ.
But promise me this.	Ṣugbọn ṣe ileri fun mi eyi.
The bookstores are amazing.	Awọn ile itaja iwe jẹ iyanu.
But meet me as soon as you can.	Ṣugbọn pade mi ni kete bi o ti le.
Cannot turn off the phone.	Ko le yipada si pa foonu naa.
It passes from mouth to mouth.	O n kọja lati ẹnu si ẹnu.
Just think, forever and ever.	Kan ronu, lailai ati lailai.
Do not do this to me.	Maṣe ṣe eyi si mi.
Gift for the child.	Ẹbun fun ọmọ naa.
There are still many.	Ọpọlọpọ ṣi wa.
He did not try to surround me.	Ko gbiyanju eyikeyi lati yi mi ka.
You can do it yourself.	O le ṣe funrararẹ.
One is one.	Ọkan jẹ ọkan.
The school allows children to come to school.	Ile-iwe gba awọn ọmọde laaye lati wa si ile-iwe.
Of course, that makes it happen.	Dajudaju, iyẹn jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
I read everything they wrote to me.	Mo ka gbogbo ohun ti wọn kọ si mi.
It is easy to clean.	O rọrun lati nu.
The sun rises over the horizon.	Oorun dide si oke oke.
What a mouth.	Ohun ti ẹnu.
Such work cannot be.	Iru iṣẹ bẹẹ ko le wa.
This should happen.	Eyi yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
I added my own.	Mo fi ti ara mi kun.
Or feet.	Tabi ẹsẹ.
We have a big family.	A ni idile nla kan.
My decision is that we go now.	Ipinnu mi ni pe a lọ ni bayi.
They are father and son.	Wọn jẹ baba ati ọmọ.
Some work and some not.	Diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ ati diẹ ninu awọn ko.
And that is what they said.	Ohun to si so won niyen.
His hand on my arm.	Ọwọ rẹ lori ọwọ mi.
I get on my soul.	Mo gba lori emi mi.
Others feel one or two of them.	Awọn miiran lero ọkan tabi meji ninu wọn.
Only to complete the ending.	Nikan lati pari ipari.
I do not know well.	A ko mọ mi daradara.
Tea is a sweet drink.	Tii jẹ ohun mimu ti o dun.
I have never seen him in such a situation.	Emi ko tii ri i ni iru ipo bẹẹ.
Good for you.	O dara fun ọ.
We are in bed.	A wa lori ibusun.
Whatever happens tomorrow, it doesn't matter.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni ọla, ko ṣe pataki.
Maybe all the trees were.	Boya gbogbo awọn igi wà.
We make it easy.	A jẹ ki o rọrun.
I should not be coming to work today.	Emi ko yẹ ki n wa si iṣẹ loni.
That is the only eternal life.	Iyẹn nikan ni igbesi aye ti o wa lailai.
We must have gone two or three times.	A gbọdọ ti lọ ni igba meji tabi mẹta.
Even small children can recognize human faces.	Paapaa awọn ọmọde kekere le da awọn oju eniyan mọ.
Maybe we could have stopped it.	Boya a le ti da a duro.
Maybe a lot of things.	Boya ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
Do something special for them.	Ṣe nkan pataki fun wọn.
Hard to hear.	Gidigidi lati gbọ.
You should never do anything like that again, do you understand.	Iwọ ko gbọdọ ṣe ohunkohun bi iyẹn lẹẹkansi, ṣe o loye.
However, it may not be.	Sibẹsibẹ, o le jẹ pe ko si.
He spoke after all.	O ti sọrọ lẹhin gbogbo.
The sister didn't get anyone, you know.	Arabinrin ko gba ẹnikẹni, o mọ.
Maybe he is on his way out.	Boya o wa lori ọna rẹ jade.
To get it.	Lati gba a.
This book was very well written.	Iwe yi ti a gan daradara kọ.
Either we pass or they come.	Boya a kọja tabi wọn wa.
The function we want the string to work on.	Iṣẹ ti a fẹ ki okun naa ṣiṣẹ.
But that does not seem to be the case for some.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko dabi pe o to fun diẹ ninu wọn.
They must be informed about this.	Wọn gbọdọ jẹ alaye nipa eyi.
We changed.	A yipada.
I love them so much.	Mo nifẹ wọn pupọ.
I can help you change.	Mo le ran ọ lọwọ lati yipada.
But he did not understand until morning.	Ṣugbọn ko loye titi di owurọ.
It means we have a lot of time to work things out.	O tumọ si pe a ni pipẹ pupọ lati ṣiṣẹ awọn nkan jade.
You can not pull out.	O ko le fa jade.
If the weather permits, the tour will begin.	Ti oju ojo ba gba laaye, irin-ajo naa yoo bẹrẹ.
We have everything we want, you know.	A ni ohun gbogbo ti a fẹ, o mọ.
He lives alone in a big house.	O ngbe nikan ni ile nla kan.
Nowhere to go.	Ko si ibiti o lọ.
I went to bathe, it was very relaxing.	Mo lọ wẹ, o jẹ isinmi pupọ.
Or it happens at the same time.	Tabi o ṣẹlẹ ni akoko kanna.
They need to understand how to read the future.	Wọn nilo lati ni oye bi o ṣe le ka ọjọ iwaju.
He is still alive.	O tun wa laaye.
Anything we say or do is wrong.	Ohunkohun ti a sọ tabi ṣe jẹ aṣiṣe.
I have not seen you for weeks.	Emi ko tii ri ọ fun awọn ọsẹ.
Dogs often return home at night.	Awọn aja nigbagbogbo pada si ile ni alẹ.
All information is there.	Gbogbo alaye wa nibẹ.
Again, he asked me to go see who he was.	Lẹẹkansi, o beere fun mi lati lọ wo ẹniti o jẹ.
They enjoyed the game.	Wọn gbadun ere naa.
That doesn't sound right.	Eyi ti ko dun bi i gaan.
Run it up.	Ran o soke.
We do so much.	A ṣe bẹ pupọ.
Such a sweet little thing.	Iru nkan kekere ti o dun.
He is alive, as we know.	O wa laaye, bi a ti mọ.
I am not saying that something bad happened to him.	Emi ko sọ pe ohun buburu kan ṣẹlẹ si i.
The books you love are yours.	Awọn iwe ohun ti o nifẹ si jẹ tirẹ.
Or even to run one.	Tabi paapaa lati ṣiṣe ọkan.
This may be true, and it may not be.	Eyi le jẹ otitọ, ati pe o le ma ṣe.
Or maybe not.	Tabi boya ko.
They know we have to do something about it now.	Wọn mọ pe a ni lati ṣe nkan nipa rẹ ni bayi.
I think the stories were maybe a little too much.	Mo ro pe awọn itan je boya kekere kan pupo ju.
I love your energy and your attention to details.	Mo nifẹ agbara rẹ ati akiyesi rẹ si awọn alaye.
It is a favorite song of our parents.	O jẹ orin ayanfẹ ti awọn obi wa.
I need to accept this, and it is problematic.	Mo nilo lati gba eyi, ati pe o ni iṣoro.
I do not really like it.	Emi ko fẹran rẹ gaan.
The gift arrived by boat.	Ẹbun ti de nipasẹ ọkọ.
How you reach certain decisions will no longer be so important.	Bii o ṣe de awọn ipinnu kan kii yoo ṣe pataki yẹn mọ.
Here there is no work.	Nibi ko ni iṣẹ kankan.
He told me so, in his letter.	O sọ fun mi bẹ, ninu lẹta rẹ.
He did not wear anything under the clothes.	Ko wọ ohunkohun labẹ aṣọ naa.
I should be talking.	Mo yẹ ki n sọrọ.
They don’t like this.	Wọn ko fẹ eyi.
Little things let you go.	Awọn ohun kekere ni o jẹ ki o lọ.
I took this picture for you.	Mo ya aworan yii fun ọ.
Thoughts on work.	Awọn ero lori iṣẹ.
But not good.	Sugbon ko dara.
He looked at the picture for a few minutes.	O wo aworan naa fun awọn iṣẹju diẹ.
And it was.	Ati awọn ti o wà.
Of course, this is not entirely true.	Dajudaju, kii ṣe otitọ patapata.
You need to give people time.	O nilo lati fun eniyan ni akoko.
So is your office.	Bẹẹ ni ọfiisi rẹ.
For my sake, they have been.	Nitori mi, wọn ti jẹ.
The word of the mother is impossible to read.	Ọrọ ti iya ko ṣee ṣe lati ka.
Maybe you have seen that.	Boya o ti rii iyẹn.
I'm just making a point.	Mo kan n ṣe aaye kan.
He will do a great job.	Oun yoo ṣe iṣẹ nla kan.
How to do it and what is worth taking.	Bii o ṣe le ṣe ati kini o tọ lati mu.
Just walk.	O kan rin.
Maybe he won’t be.	Boya oun kii yoo jẹ.
I finished.	Mo ti pari.
I told you before.	Mo ti sọ fun ọ tẹlẹ.
We must continue.	A gbọdọ tẹsiwaju.
And for me.	Ati fun mi.
However, things are not so simple today.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn nkan ko rọrun pupọ loni.
More stuff, more stuff.	Awọn nkan diẹ sii, awọn nkan diẹ sii.
I wish we could be friends.	Mo fẹ pe a le jẹ ọrẹ.
They are back and good as new.	Wọn ti pada ati dara bi tuntun.
I know very well.	Mo mọ dara julọ.
Doing something like that will change you forever.	Ṣiṣe nkan bii iyẹn yoo yipada ọ lailai.
And some times it works.	Ati diẹ ninu awọn igba ti o ṣiṣẹ.
I can't lift it anymore.	Emi ko tun le gbe e.
They want to look great.	Wọn fẹ lati wo pupọ.
Several suggestions have been made to explain it.	Awọn imọran pupọ ti ni imọran lati ṣe alaye rẹ.
Amount! 	Iye!
For services to education.	Fun awọn iṣẹ si ẹkọ.
However, that is not the case.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn kii ṣe bẹẹ.
Your timeline has not yet been reached.	Ko tii tii de ipo akoko rẹ sibẹsibẹ.
In the future.	Ni akoko ọla.
The other man, that's not my father.	Ọkunrin to ku, iyẹn kii ṣe baba mi.
You don’t really get over it.	O ko gba lori gaan.
It fills my mouth.	O kun ẹnu mi.
Maybe that's not a bad thing.	Boya iyẹn kii ṣe nkan buburu bẹ.
The words will not come.	Awọn ọrọ naa kii yoo wa.
It's too late.	O ti pẹ.
He knew he was telling us the truth.	O mọ pe o sọ otitọ fun wa.
It is your favorite song.	O jẹ orin ayanfẹ rẹ.
The word is out.	Ọrọ naa ti jade.
Why do people live in big cities?	Kini idi ti awọn eniyan n gbe ni awọn ilu nla?
Whether we like it or not.	Boya a fẹ tabi ko.
I can't talk or anything.	Emi ko le sọrọ tabi ohunkohun.
I have to be like him.	Mo ni lati dabi rẹ.
Or any other man.	Tabi eyikeyi miiran ọkunrin.
I am sure this will help.	Mo dajudaju pe eyi yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.
You have to hurry.	O ni lati yara.
Take my word for it.	Gba ọrọ mi fun.
He did not want anyone to suspect him.	Ko fe ki enikeni fura oun.
I look around.	Mo wo ni ayika.
After a few minutes he shook his head.	Lẹhin iṣẹju diẹ o mi ori rẹ.
Even the youngest children help to build the beds.	Paapaa awọn ọmọde ti o kere julọ ṣe iranlọwọ lati kọ awọn ibusun.
It is true.	Otitọ ni.
He sat for a few minutes.	O joko fun iṣẹju diẹ.
Some of you will want to do more.	Diẹ ninu yin yoo fẹ lati ṣe diẹ sii.
If you're tired, you can't do that.	Ti o ba rẹ rẹ, o ko le ṣe bẹ.
Things change, big brother.	Nkan yipada, arakunrin nla.
He has lived in this city all his life.	O ti gbe ni ilu yii ni gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ.
You have not waited for him.	O ti ko duro fun u.
This is where you can ask questions and stuff like that.	Eyi ni ibiti o ti le beere awọn ibeere ati awọn nkan bii iyẹn.
But most importantly, use common sense.	Ṣugbọn ṣe pataki julọ, lo ọgbọn ọgbọn.
But they are not mine.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii ṣe ti mi.
There are many ways to kill cats, you know.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna lati pa ologbo, o mọ.
I never played again.	Mo ti ko dun lẹẹkansi.
See them for what they are.	Wo wọn fun ohun ti wọn jẹ.
You should have seen this coming.	O yẹ ki o ti rii eyi ti n bọ.
That can kill you.	Iyẹn le pa ọ.
It is the life of a dog.	Igbesi aye aja ni.
Of course it has worked very well for us.	O dajudaju o ti ṣiṣẹ daradara pupọ fun wa.
Sometimes you just want to repeat the words.	Nigba miiran o fẹ tun awọn ọrọ sọ.
On the walk.	Ni rin.
There is nothing better than that.	Ko si ohun ti o dara ju iyẹn lọ gaan.
Don't eat me.	Maṣe jẹ mi.
You look about my age.	O wo nipa ọjọ ori mi.
This, however, works both ways.	Eyi, sibẹsibẹ, ṣiṣẹ awọn ọna mejeeji.
We hope to do the same.	A nireti lati ṣe kanna.
Only one of them works.	Nikan ọkan ninu wọn ṣiṣẹ.
Very good and you get it.	O dara pupọ ati pe o gba.
We will learn from that.	A yoo kọ ẹkọ lati inu iyẹn.
A great job.	Iṣẹ nla kan.
Leave things as they are.	Fi awọn nkan silẹ bi wọn ṣe jẹ.
It doesn't matter at all.	Maṣe ṣe pataki rara.
You know you can do this again and again and again.	O mọ pe o le ṣe eyi lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
We were only a few years.	A wà nikan kan ọdun diẹ.
At this point and after a while you may make a mistake.	Ni aaye yii ati lẹhin akoko o le ṣe aṣiṣe.
Not the.	Kii ṣe awọn.
He also did not look his way.	O tun ko wo ọna rẹ.
For us, every holiday is important.	Fun wa, gbogbo isinmi jẹ pataki.
You’re sure to find something you just can’t live without.	O da ọ loju lati wa nkan ti o kan ko le gbe laisi.
One pass, he promised himself.	Ọkan kọja, o ṣe ileri fun ara rẹ.
Several times, someone called me to ask where something was.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba, ẹnikan ti pe mi lati beere ibi ti nkan kan wa.
I called you twice.	Mo pe e ni igba meji.
He really enjoyed his work.	O gbadun iṣẹ rẹ pupọ.
Or through it.	Tabi nipasẹ rẹ.
You can’t think like that.	O ko le ronu bi iyẹn.
It was, and it was a big deal in my family.	O jẹ, ati pe o jẹ adehun nla ninu idile mi.
However, this is not a reason to dismiss the idea.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi kii ṣe idi lati kọ ero naa kuro.
But you can't stand that.	Ṣugbọn o ko le duro bẹ.
It's great.	O dara julọ.
She has a name for herself from her daughter.	O ni imọran fun orukọ lati ọdọ ọmọbirin rẹ.
People like you.	Eniyan bi o.
He has been played by his work.	O ti dun nipasẹ iṣẹ rẹ.
I'll be back in an hour.	Emi yoo pada wa ni wakati kan.
I just worried about it.	Mo kan ni aniyan nipa rẹ.
Walking has already helped and it works now.	Rin ti ṣe iranlọwọ tẹlẹ ati pe o ṣiṣẹ ni bayi.
But something else happened.	Ṣugbọn ohun miiran ti ṣẹlẹ.
Like even this day.	Bi paapaa ọjọ yii.
I run everywhere.	Mo sare nibi gbogbo.
I walk up and down.	Mo rin si oke ati isalẹ.
No agreement, no agreement.	Ko si adehun, ko si adehun.
Just put it all together.	O kan fi gbogbo rẹ papọ.
Look at your hair.	Wo irun ori rẹ.
It can’t start early for things like that.	Ko le bẹrẹ ni kutukutu fun awọn nkan bii iyẹn.
I can't get to do it.	Emi ko le gba lati ṣe.
It is very easy to use.	O rọrun pupọ lati lo.
At first he hesitated to take it.	Ni akọkọ o ṣiyemeji lati mu.
You can not wait.	O ko le duro.
We use these two rules.	A lo awọn ofin meji wọnyi.
I know yourself.	Mo mọ ara rẹ.
I will never ask you again.	Emi ko ni beere lọwọ rẹ lẹẹkansi.
He said a car was waiting for him.	O sọ pe ọkọ kan n duro de oun.
If that were possible it would have happened.	Ti iyẹn ba ṣee ṣe o yoo ti ṣẹlẹ.
Put some in a small bag.	Fi diẹ ninu apo kekere kan.
It happens here.	O ṣẹlẹ nibi.
In fact, that’s the whole point.	Ni otitọ, iyẹn ni gbogbo aaye naa.
The relevant text is repeated below.	Ọrọ ti o yẹ ni a tun ṣe ni isalẹ.
They talked about that, of course.	Wọn ti sọrọ nipa eyi, dajudaju.
Or we will forever.	Tabi a yoo lailai.
My late father.	Baba mi ti o ku.
Even as a young child, it was important.	Paapaa bi ọmọde kekere, o ti jẹ pataki.
We do not need a plan to tell us that.	A ko nilo eto lati sọ fun wa pe.
You can not beat time or age.	O ko le lu akoko tabi ọjọ ori.
Let me drink at my table.	Jẹ ki n mu ni tabili mi.
And maybe not.	Ati boya rara.
The train ride is an hour long.	Irin-ajo ọkọ oju irin jẹ wakati kan gun.
I started to hope to write something.	Mo ti bẹrẹ lati nireti lati kọ nkan kan.
They do not know the law.	Wọn ko mọ ofin.
It is definitely decided.	O ti pinnu gaan.
Obviously, her parents did not like her.	O han gbangba pe awọn obi rẹ ko fẹran rẹ.
Let everyone know what you did.	Jẹ ki gbogbo eniyan mọ ohun ti o ṣe.
Girls and stuff.	Awọn ọmọbirin ati nkan.
You know how to drive really well.	O mọ bi o ṣe le wakọ gaan.
I understand now.	Mo loye bayi.
He will not miss me.	Oun ko ni padanu mi.
Today is the day.	Loni ni ọjọ naa.
The sister is out of her mind now.	Arabinrin naa ti jade ninu awọn ero rẹ ni bayi.
I was in town an hour ago.	Mo wa ni ilu ni wakati kan sẹhin.
Obviously, there is a big issue to talk about.	O han ni, ọrọ nla kan wa lati sọrọ nipa.
In the room there are two beds.	Ninu yara naa ni ibusun meji.
Beneficial people can enjoy a higher quality of life.	Awọn eniyan ti o ni anfani le gbadun igbesi aye ti o ga julọ.
There is a time.	O wa ni akoko kan.
This is my life.	Bayi ni aye mi.
I should not say anything.	Emi ko yẹ ki n sọ ohunkohun.
There are many areas that also need attention.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn aaye wa ti o tun nilo akiyesi.
You know how these things work.	O mọ bi nkan wọnyi ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
Live only here.	Gbe nikan nibi.
Make bread.	Ṣe akara.
It doesn't work, for another.	Ko ṣiṣẹ, fun miiran.
You have been under a great deal of stress.	O ti wa labẹ iye wahala nla.
I eat it all.	Mo jẹ ohun gbogbo rẹ.
How often do you ask that question?	Igba melo ni o beere ibeere yẹn?
I will try hard to get started today.	Emi yoo gbiyanju pupọ lati bẹrẹ loni.
You can try.	O le gbiyanju.
And they think they know how good that is.	Ati pe wọn ro pe wọn mọ bi iyẹn ṣe dara to.
If he sees you here, he will see you there.	Ti o ba ri ọ nibi, yoo ri ọ nibẹ.
They were not told they were wrong.	Wọn ko sọ fun wọn pe wọn ṣe aṣiṣe.
I took the morning train.	Mo gba ọkọ oju irin owurọ.
Would love to see if any good.	Yoo fẹ lati rii boya o dara eyikeyi.
I hope you all have many years together.	Mo nireti pe gbogbo yin ni ọpọlọpọ ọdun papọ.
I have no idea what we can do.	Mo ni imọran ohun ti a le ṣe.
I’ve long wanted to play this game.	Mo ti sọ gun fẹ lati mu ere yi.
We’re back to the game with the big boys.	A n pada si ere pẹlu awọn ọmọkunrin nla.
I am not used to such a thing anymore.	Emi ko lo si iru nkan bayi mọ.
One by one the others came into being.	Ọkan nipa ọkan awọn miiran wa sinu.
They turned to make space.	Wọn yipada lati ṣe aaye.
Of course everyone seems to have a great time.	O dajudaju o dabi pe gbogbo eniyan ni akoko nla.
I have not drunk.	Emi ko ti mu.
He thought something for.	O ro nkankan fun.
Now we have to go.	Bayi a ni lati lọ.
After such work there is always a plan, a plan.	Lẹhin iru iṣẹ bẹẹ nigbagbogbo ni imọran kan, eto kan.
Life here is not easy.	Igbesi aye nibi ko rọrun.
Maybe need work on the driver.	Boya nilo iṣẹ lori ọkọ awakọ.
If you buy now.	Ti o ba ra ni bayi.

And it can not kill.	Ati pe ko le pa.
You are the best sister you can be.	Iwọ ni arabinrin ti o dara julọ ti o le jẹ.

The report is complete, but there are errors.	Iroyin naa ti pari, ṣugbọn awọn aṣiṣe wa.
The sister went to the side to see what she was doing.	Arabinrin naa lọ si ẹgbẹ lati wo ohun ti o ṣe.
But you can wait.	Ṣugbọn o le duro.
That's what most people do.	Ohun ti ọpọlọpọ eniyan ṣe niyẹn.
You have your own high opinion.	O ni ero giga ti ara rẹ.
Up a bit.	Soke diẹ.
Okay, not great.	O dara, kii ṣe nla.
Every day the test is the same.	Ni gbogbo ọjọ idanwo naa jẹ kanna.
He made sure he didn't last long.	O rii daju pe oun ko ni duro pẹ.
Drink water before your meal.	Mu omi mimu ṣaaju ounjẹ rẹ.

For simple tasks, everything can work fine.	Fun awọn iṣẹ ṣiṣe ti o rọrun, ohun gbogbo le ṣiṣẹ daradara.
They know what you are doing.	Wọn mọ ohun ti o ṣe.

Age does not apply to me.	Ọjọ ori ko kan mi.
Write like no tomorrow.	Kọ bi ko si ọla.
But nothing was done.	Sugbon ko si ohun ti a ṣe.
I feel what other people are feeling.	Mo lero ohun ti awọn eniyan miiran n rilara.
The process is simple.	Ọna naa rọrun.
But tell your mother.	Ṣugbọn sọ fun iya rẹ.
I will miss time.	Emi yoo padanu akoko.
And everyone wants that feeling.	Ati gbogbo eniyan fẹ rilara naa.
You now have no space here because of it.	O ni bayi ko ni aaye nibi nitori rẹ.
Just what you have to do.	O kan ohun ti o ni lati ṣe.
Of course they are talking.	Dajudaju wọn n sọrọ.
It’s similar with running.	O jẹ iru pẹlu ṣiṣe.
And you get into everything.	Ati awọn ti o gba sinu ohun gbogbo.

And believe me, this work has to be done.	Ati gbagbọ mi, iṣẹ yii ni lati ṣe.
Whatever it may be.	Ohunkohun ti o le jẹ.
Children are starving as ever.	Ebi n pa awọn ọmọde bi lailai.
He entered a bookstore one day.	O wọ ile itaja iwe kan ni ọjọ kan.
Remember that whatever we do, you can do it yourself.	Ranti pe ohunkohun ti a ṣe, o le ṣe funrararẹ.
Them.	Awon.
Well, you must eat well.	O dara, o gbọdọ jẹun daradara.
We know where we stand on that.	A mọ ibiti a duro lori iyẹn.
Rest is very important.	Isinmi ṣe pataki pupọ.
He began to sleep, but woke up again.	O bẹrẹ lati sun, ṣugbọn o ji lẹẹkansi.
You should go into the house.	O yẹ ki o lọ sinu ile.
He was always there and stayed late.	O wa nigbagbogbo o si duro pẹ.
Even the head of someone behind me.	Paapaa ori ti ẹnikan lẹhin mi.
Always true.	Ni gbogbo igba ni otitọ.
Hold your hand to my face for a minute.	Di ọwọ rẹ si oju mi ​​fun iṣẹju kan.
He changed it.	O yipada rẹ.
The work environment also helps me to love every single day.	Ayika iṣẹ tun ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi lati nifẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ kan.
However it may not be very convincing.	Sibẹsibẹ ko le ni idaniloju pupọ.
Now we stop.	Bayi a duro.
I can't allow myself to sleep.	Nko le gba ara mi laaye lati sun.
As many as possible.	Bi ọpọlọpọ bi o ti ṣee.
He asked if tomorrow's weather would be warm.	O beere boya oju ojo ọla yoo gbona.
It tastes great.	O maa n we pupo.
If you refuse, you kill someone you love.	Ti o ba kọ, o pa ẹnikan ti o nifẹ.
This thing is not about them.	Nkan yii kii ṣe nipa wọn.
I do not know why, myself.	Emi ko mo idi ti, ara mi.
I feel more like we are in the same boat.	Mo lero diẹ bi a wa ninu ọkọ oju omi kanna.
These people need to work things out on their own.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi nilo lati ṣiṣẹ awọn nkan jade ninu ara wọn.
Wait for it to leave.	Duro fun o lati lọ kuro.
You can have that, man.	O le ni iru eyi, eniyan.
He is very angry.	O binu gidigidi.
I want to move.	Mo fe gbe.
We live life to ourselves.	A n gbe igbesi aye pẹlu ara wa.
Thirty days have passed.	Ọgbọn ọjọ ti kọja.
So it helps them.	Nitorina o ṣe iranlọwọ fun wọn.
At first, they were not strong enough.	Ni akọkọ, wọn ko wa ni agbara to.
It's a great place.	Ibi nla ni.
They have no life at all.	Wọn ko ni aye rara.
I have heard much of this.	Mo ti gbọ Elo ti yi.
The more trees, the better.	Awọn igi diẹ sii, dara julọ.
Cities are a good place to find work.	Awọn ilu jẹ ibi ti o dara lati wa iṣẹ.
Only you can do that.	Iwọ nikan ni o le ṣe iyẹn.
Who out there would like to be our friend on this trip ?.	Tani jade nibẹ yoo fẹ lati jẹ ọrẹ wa ni irin-ajo yii?.
I have known him all my life.	Mo ti mọ rẹ ni gbogbo igbesi aye mi.
What he hates is the fact that his father is gone.	Ohun ti o korira ni o daju wipe baba rẹ lọ.
We get to talk again in the morning.	A gba lati sọrọ lẹẹkansi ni owurọ.
Can you ask your work person ?????	Ṣe o le beere lọwọ eniyan iṣẹ rẹ?????
What do you call those big trucks?	Kini o pe awọn ọkọ nla nla yẹn?
But please, for the time being, let me do my job.	Ṣugbọn jọwọ, fun akoko yii, jẹ ki n ṣe iṣẹ mi.
I do not call myself perfect.	Emi ko ni pe ara mi pe.
But not here or now.	Sugbon ko nibi tabi bayi.
I will not buy the new car.	Emi kii yoo ra ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ tuntun naa.
I just don’t like this moment.	Mo kan ko nifẹ si akoko yii.
It is good to see this approach taken.	O jẹ ohun ti o dara lati rii ọna yii ti a mu.
But we fear it will.	Ṣugbọn a bẹru pe yoo ṣe.
They will not see.	Wọn kii yoo rii.
You will improve, you will.	Iwọ yoo dara si, iwọ yoo.
This can be an accident.	Eyi le jẹ ijamba.
He gave me a book.	O fun mi ni iwe kan.
Use another cup to get it.	Lo ife miiran lati gba a.
There is no benefit at all.	Ko si anfani rara.
So far, everything is pretty much going its way.	Titi di aaye yi, ohun gbogbo ti lẹwa Elo lọ ọna rẹ.
He will buy that book.	Oun yoo ra iwe yẹn.
Think about your work.	Ronu lori iṣẹ rẹ.
But we do not see how it looks.	Ṣugbọn a ko rii bi o ṣe ri.
You can hurt or even kill yourself.	O le ṣe ipalara tabi paapaa pa ara rẹ.
He also sent me some money.	O tun fi owo diẹ ranṣẹ si mi.
He lives, as many young people do, now.	O ngbe, bi ọpọlọpọ awọn ọdọ ṣe, ni bayi.
I heard the door below me open, and locked again.	Mo gbọ ilẹkun ti o wa ni isalẹ mi ti o ṣii, ati tii lẹẹkansi.
I know what is right and true.	Mo mọ ohun ti o tọ ati otitọ.
Let’s have more side.	Jẹ ki a ni ẹgbẹ diẹ sii.
They do not know each other.	Wọn ko mọ ara wọn.
They know when a woman is living alone.	Wọn mọ nigbati obinrin kan n gbe nikan.
You are not on trial.	Iwọ ko wa lori idanwo.
This method can be used for travel.	Ọna yii le ṣee lo fun irin-ajo.
At least it looks like you're doing something.	O kere dabi pe o n ṣe nkan kan.
And well, the other day, it happened.	Ati daradara, ni ọjọ miiran, o ṣẹlẹ.
But that is good.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn dara.
The problem is that they do not.	Iṣoro naa ni pe wọn ko ni.
Let's get the car back and get the bus.	Jẹ ki a da ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ pada ki a gba ọkọ akero naa.
He had fallen on a chair.	O ti lọ silẹ lori ijoko kan.
But no, he was angry.	Ṣugbọn rara, o binu.
It may take some time.	O le gba akoko.
You will know things that they will not.	Iwọ yoo mọ awọn nkan ti wọn kii yoo.
It doesn't seem fair.	O dabi pe ko gba.
It is everywhere.	O wa ni gbogbo aaye.
He held it for a minute.	O gbe e fun iṣẹju kan.
He believed when he said he loved her.	O gbagbọ nigbati o sọ pe o nifẹ rẹ.
It should not be.	Ko yẹ ki o wa.
People have their own world.	Eniyan ni aye ti ara wọn.
You may notice it after months have passed.	O le ṣe akiyesi rẹ lẹhin awọn oṣu ti kọja.
Get help now.	Gba iranlọwọ ni bayi.
They know everything there is, to anyone.	Wọn mọ ohun gbogbo ti o wa, si ẹnikẹni.
He wants more for us.	O fẹ diẹ sii fun wa.
He’s playing good football.	O n ṣe bọọlu ti o dara.
You can stay home with us.	O le duro ni ile pẹlu wa.
But they talk because they love people.	Ṣugbọn wọn sọrọ nitori pe wọn nifẹ awọn eniyan.
They know what they want and where they will get it.	Wọn mọ ohun ti wọn fẹ ati ibi ti wọn yoo gba.
It's a really good device.	O jẹ ẹrọ ti o dara gaan.
They go to work, throw balls around, buy food.	Wọn lọ si iṣẹ, ju bọọlu ni ayika, ra awọn ounjẹ.
Which means you have reached them.	Eyi ti o tumọ si pe o ti de ọdọ wọn.
Do not do this.	Maṣe ṣe eyi.
Do not force them.	Maṣe fi agbara mu wọn.
Do this again, and they may kill you!	Ṣe eyi lẹẹkansi, ati pe wọn le pa ọ!
Our work is not complete.	Iṣẹ wa ko pari.
Don't let me hurt you.	Maṣe jẹ ki n mu ọ ni ibi.
I am trying to give to other people.	Mo n gbiyanju lati fi fun awọn miiran eniyan.
Art must make its own way and through its own ways.	Aworan gbọdọ ṣe ọna tirẹ ati nipasẹ awọn ọna tirẹ.
But the game is turning to that.	Ṣugbọn ere naa n yipada si iyẹn.
People here know what to expect from them.	Awọn eniyan nibi mọ ohun ti a reti lati ọdọ wọn.
Me and my parents.	Emi ati awon obi mi.
He left, his words obviously hating him.	O lọ kuro, ọrọ rẹ han gbangba korira fun u.
More will be done in the future.	Diẹ sii yoo ṣee ṣe ni ọjọ iwaju.
Maybe a few are catching the last one.	Boya awọn diẹ ti wa ni mimu ọkan kẹhin.
And stay that way for weeks.	Ati ki o duro ni ọna naa fun awọn ọsẹ.
I can't stay here with you.	Emi ko le duro nibi pẹlu rẹ.
It was new, about a month on the project.	O jẹ tuntun, bii oṣu kan lori iṣẹ naa.
Never mind.	Maṣe yọ nu.
But, you know?	Ṣugbọn, ṣe o mọ?
He knew he could not keep this for long.	O mọ pe oun ko le tọju eyi fun pipẹ.
We are here.	A wà nibi.
The body is very solid.	Awọn ara jẹ gidigidi ri to.
Will be in the men's room.	Yoo wa ninu yara awọn ọkunrin.
Life is very, very good !.	Igbesi aye jẹ pupọ, dara pupọ!.
We are very happy.	Inu wa dun pupo.
So the shoes were bought.	Nitorina awọn bata ti ra.
I look at my phone.	Mo wo foonu mi.
It’s an important future, woman, not a thing of the past.	O jẹ ọjọ iwaju ti o ṣe pataki, obinrin, kii ṣe ohun ti o kọja.
It will have nothing right now.	Kii yoo ni nkankan ni bayi.
I can't believe it.	Emi ko le gbagbọ.
We do not belong to this world.	A kii ṣe ti aye yii.
And it ended.	Ati pe o pari.
It is very new.	O jẹ ohun tuntun pupọ.
It seemed to happen in a minute.	O dabi enipe o ṣẹlẹ ni iṣẹju kan.
I know you love me.	Mo mọ pe o nifẹ mi.
Some sweet, some mean.	Diẹ ninu awọn dun, diẹ ninu awọn tumọ.
It was impossible for me to do either.	Ko ṣee ṣe fun mi lati ṣe boya.
They do not have to see that.	Wọn ko ni lati rii iyẹn.
He asked if he could talk to me.	O beere boya o le ba mi sọrọ.
He reached out to her.	O de ọdọ rẹ.
We let them say so.	A jẹ ki wọn sọ bẹ.
So you have to get a phone.	Nitorina o ni lati gba foonu kan.
Do what makes you happy.	Ṣe ohun ti o mu inu rẹ dun.
Some people refuse to walk by plane.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan kọ lati rin nipasẹ ọkọ ofurufu.
The less we talk about it on the street the better.	Ti o kere julọ ti a sọ nipa rẹ ni ita yoo dara julọ.
Once you hear it, you can't get out of your mind.	Ni kete ti o ba gbọ, o ko le yọ kuro ninu ọkan rẹ.
I only know what you need.	Mo mọ ohun ti o nilo nikan.
Do not let them doubt.	Maṣe jẹ ki wọn ṣiyemeji.
There are so many.	Nibẹ ni o wa ki ọpọlọpọ.
He will wake her up early tomorrow.	Yoo ji e ni kutukutu ọla.
Even less can be enough.	Paapaa kere si le to.
I would love to talk to him.	Mo nifẹ lati ba a sọrọ.
You will need your strength.	Iwọ yoo nilo agbara rẹ.
Home life is always enough.	Igbesi aye ile nigbagbogbo to.
But it must continue.	Ṣugbọn o gbọdọ tẹsiwaju.
They are interested in that.	Wọn nifẹ ninu iyẹn.
They went to rescue the baby.	Wọn lọ lati gba ọmọ naa silẹ.
Do not eat them too.	Maṣe jẹ wọn ju.
Tomorrow will be our last day here.	Ọla ni yoo jẹ ọjọ ikẹhin wa nibi.
It has already done so and it ends up being bad.	O ti ṣe bẹ tẹlẹ ati pe o ti pari ni buburu.
He left town.	O kuro ni ilu.
And you.	Ati pe iwọ.
Start with that, and that’s all.	Bẹrẹ pẹlu iyẹn, ati pe iyẹn nikan.
I can not explain it.	Nko le se alaye re.
I look at them.	Mo wo wọn.
If you have, it will force your hand.	Ti o ba ni, yoo fi agbara mu ọwọ rẹ.
Everyone has to work in that.	Gbogbo eniyan ni lati ṣiṣẹ ninu iyẹn.
This is what most of the world is used to.	Eleyi jẹ ohun ti julọ ti aye ti wa ni lo lati.
There is more range, always.	Nibẹ ni diẹ sii ibiti o ti wa, nigbagbogbo.
Some people believe that old art has improved our lives.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan gbagbọ pe aworan atijọ ti mu igbesi aye wa dara si.
Your school books must be in school.	Awọn iwe ile-iwe rẹ gbọdọ ti wa ni ile-iwe.
I'm alone, you know.	Mo wa nikan, o mọ.
She looked up from her desk as they entered.	O wo soke lati ori tabili rẹ bi wọn ti wọ.
I am sure you will be out in a month or two.	Mo da mi loju pe iwọ yoo jade ni oṣu kan tabi meji.
That is no longer possible.	Iyẹn ko ṣee ṣe mọ.
Two teachers stand in front.	Awọn olukọ meji duro ni iwaju.
He had no reason to be afraid, he said to himself.	Ko ni idi lati bẹru, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
It is becoming him.	O ti n di u.
When things go well, there is nothing like it.	Nigbati nkan ba lọ daradara, ko si nkankan bi rẹ.
I don't deserve to know that but it does, of course.	Ko yẹ lati mọ iyẹn ṣugbọn o ṣe, dajudaju.
Some have for sure.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni fun daju.
That brother did not know his job.	Arakunrin yẹn ko mọ iṣẹ rẹ.
You can see you are looking for them.	O le rii pe o n wa wọn.
I want to remove, or change.	Mo fẹ lati yọ kuro, tabi yi pada.
But you will get this too.	Ṣugbọn o yoo gba eyi pẹlu.
It has worked for the best.	O ti ṣiṣẹ fun ohun ti o dara julọ.
About a boy.	Nipa ọmọkunrin kan.
We need that from you.	A nilo iyẹn lati ọdọ rẹ.
This is one for me.	Eyi jẹ ọkan fun mi.
His old life.	Igbesi aye atijọ rẹ.
And power will return.	Ati agbara yoo pada.
He looked at me.	O wo lori mi.
Remember when it comes to you.	Ranti nigbati o ba de fun ọ.
Do not kill my child.	Maṣe pa ọmọ mi.
There will be.	Yoo wa.
We started to ask everything.	A bẹrẹ lati beere ohun gbogbo.
We want out.	A fẹ jade.
Group on the same day.	Ẹgbẹ ni ọjọ kanna.
The issue is now.	Ọrọ naa wa ni bayi.
Please seek help.	Jọwọ wa iranlọwọ.
New home.	Ile tuntun.
I want to say we know what to do.	Mo fẹ sọ pe a mọ kini lati ṣe.
The sister heard the story of her friend.	Arabinrin naa gbọ itan ọrẹ rẹ.
Or those under him.	Tabi awọn ti o wa labẹ rẹ.
Here my sister met him.	Nibi ti arabinrin mi ti pade rẹ.
He will not help you.	Oun ko ni ran ọ lọwọ.
That always means their stuff has a significant value.	Iyẹn nigbagbogbo tumọ si nkan wọn ni iye pataki.
He never told the truth.	O ko sọ otitọ rara.
Stop doing or thinking about things you don't like, and move on.	Duro ṣiṣe tabi ronu nipa ohun ti o ko fẹ, ki o tẹsiwaju.
This will be shown below.	A yoo fi eyi han ni isalẹ.
Some say he is angry with everyone.	Diẹ ninu awọn sọ pe o binu si gbogbo eniyan.
You have to tell the truth.	O ni lati sọ otitọ.
Lots of people came to board the train.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan wa lati wọ ọkọ oju irin naa.
He pushed through the doors and walked to the trees.	O si ti nipasẹ awọn ilẹkun ati ki o rin si awọn igi.
Live a better life.	Gbe igbesi aye to dara julọ.
Maybe it will too.	Boya o yoo tun.
A joke.	A dara.
No, it cannot happen.	Rara, ko le ṣẹlẹ.
Whatever happens now, you still want to get out of it.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni bayi, o tun fẹ jade.
He went and gave the child to the mother.	O si lọ o si fi ọmọ fun iya.
Things could be better.	Awọn nkan le dara.
It has become.	O ti di.
Here are their little faces.	Eyi ni awọn oju kekere wọn.
And people continue to be on our side.	Ati pe awọn eniyan tẹsiwaju lati wa ni ẹgbẹ wa.
They can't stand it they can't know how men can.	Wọn ko le duro ti wọn ko le mọ bi awọn ọkunrin ṣe le.
No big names yet.	Ko si awọn orukọ nla sibẹsibẹ.
I feel good to know that.	Mo lero dara lati mọ iyẹn.
I'm not sure what to do with it.	Emi ko rii daju ohun ti yoo ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
New ideas are needed in this area.	A nilo awọn imọran tuntun ni agbegbe yii.
Not even your life.	Ko paapaa igbesi aye rẹ.
You need to return to your home.	O nilo lati pada si ile rẹ.
Something will have to do about that, especially.	Nkankan yoo ni lati ṣe nipa iyẹn, paapaa.
Everything is still there.	Ohun gbogbo tun wa.
Of course know their stuff.	Dajudaju mọ nkan wọn.
All this changes, in a few minutes.	Gbogbo eyi n yipada, ni iṣẹju diẹ.
The men were human, not like his father.	Awọn ọkunrin naa jẹ eniyan, ko dabi baba rẹ.
I do not see them.	Mo ko ri wọn.
Not in the way we need it.	Kii ṣe ni ọna ti a nilo rẹ.
Why is everyone talking so fast?	Kilode ti gbogbo eniyan fi yara sọrọ bẹ?
And we are also very happy together.	Ati pe a tun dun pupọ papọ.
We will get everyone on this.	A yoo gba gbogbo eniyan lori eyi.
And it’s even harder to say it.	Ati pe o paapaa nira sii lati sọ ọ.
I can't wait.	Emi ko le pẹ.
Because maybe you just hear what you want to hear.	Nitori boya ohun ti o fẹ gbọ nikan ni o n gbọ.
You know it will all work out.	O mọ pe gbogbo rẹ yoo ṣiṣẹ jade.
The group started the journey well.	Ẹgbẹ naa bẹrẹ irin-ajo naa daradara.
It was all only too true.	O je gbogbo nikan ju otitọ.
This is not a good time to visit.	Eyi kii ṣe akoko ti o dara lati ṣabẹwo.
Maybe they will come with time.	Boya wọn yoo wa pẹlu akoko.
Make room, kids, or be late for school!	Ṣe yara, awọn ọmọde, tabi a ma pẹ fun ile-iwe!
There was much to his advantage.	Nibẹ wà Elo lati anfani rẹ.
Sister house give me tea.	Arabinrin ile fun mi tii.
He wrote many books.	O kọ ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe.
I come back.	Mo pada wa.
The front door is open.	Ilẹkun iwaju ti ṣii.
I'm sure this is it.	O da mi loju pe eyi ni.
He enjoys working there.	O gbadun ṣiṣẹ nibẹ.
They do a lot of work for the community.	Wọn ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn iṣẹ fun agbegbe.
Is this the way we have already walked?	Ṣe eyi jẹ ọna ti a ti rin tẹlẹ?
I don't know him very well.	Emi ko mọ rẹ daradara.
So nothing really needs to be said.	Nitorina ko si ohun ti o nilo lati sọ gaan.
This is my personal area.	Eyi ni agbegbe ti ara mi.
We all love your stuff.	Gbogbo wa nifẹ awọn nkan rẹ.
His favorite letters.	Awọn lẹta rẹ ti o nifẹ julọ.
Well, at least the car is still here.	O dara, o kere ju ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa tun wa nibi.
Just think about it for a minute.	Kan ronu nipa rẹ ni iṣẹju kan.
The reason you give me.	Idi ti o fun mi.
It seems to have something to do with the mountain.	O dabi pe o jẹ nkan lati ṣe pẹlu oke naa.
Take your body, take your heart, and thus take your picture.	Mu ara rẹ, mu ọkan rẹ, ati bayi mu aworan rẹ.
This is the essence of education.	Eyi ni pataki ti ẹkọ ẹkọ.
I tried something with this but it did not work.	Mo gbiyanju nkankan pẹlu eyi ṣugbọn ko ṣiṣẹ.
I kept making everyone and everything around me wrong.	Mo ti pa ṣiṣe gbogbo eniyan ati ohun gbogbo ti o wa ni ayika mi ti ko tọ.
But not enough.	Sugbon ko to.
Something went wrong there.	Nkankan ro aṣiṣe nibẹ.
During the season.	Nigba akoko.
What inspired you to write this book?	Kini o jẹ ki o kọ iwe yii?
It travels for the cost of the book spent.	O rin irin-ajo fun iye owo iwe ti a lo.
This is for the best.	Eleyi jẹ fun awọn ti o dara ju.
It’s what makes things happen.	O jẹ ohun ti n ṣe awọn nkan.
I can’t live without it.	Emi ko le gbe laisi rẹ.
This is a great book to do in a class.	Eyi jẹ iwe nla lati ṣe ni kilasi kan.
That is not my friend's body.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ara ọrẹ mi.
Before we know about any of this.	Ṣaaju ki a to mọ nipa eyikeyi eyi.
You get outside.	O gba ita.
We give back to our community in more ways than one.	A fun pada si agbegbe wa ni awọn ọna pupọ ju ọkan lọ.
I think you are on the job.	Mo ro pe o wa lori ise.
We will be back!	A yoo pada!
Arise, arise.	Dide, dide.
It is your area.	Agbegbe rẹ ni.
I will do something about it.	Emi yoo ṣe nkankan nipa rẹ.
His mother has been, in fact.	Iya rẹ ti jẹ, paapaa.
My time was last week.	Aago mi wa ni ọsẹ to kọja.
It is very difficult at times.	O nira pupọ ni awọn igba.
You will have to do better next time.	Iwọ yoo ni lati ṣe dara julọ ni akoko miiran.
He was behind it.	O si wà lẹhin rẹ.
I do not mind.	Mo binu.
I was in the house, but the others did not know.	Mo wa ninu ile, ṣugbọn awọn miiran ko mọ.
You would think it was too high, it wouldn’t.	Iwọ yoo ro pe o ga ju, kii ṣe.
I start to say.	Mo bẹrẹ lati sọ.
We must look to the future.	A gbọdọ wo si ojo iwaju.
But he could not run.	Sugbon ko le sare.
He is married and has two children.	O ti ni iyawo o si ni ọmọ meji.
Everything happens for a reason.	Ohun gbogbo ṣẹlẹ fun idi kan.
I do not see it.	Nko wo o.
But this was a look.	Sugbon yi je kan wo.
They agree to make rules here.	Wọn gba lati ṣe awọn ofin nibi.
I know your old man.	Mo ti mọ rẹ atijọ ọkunrin.
The other day, nothing good.	Awọn ọjọ miiran, ko si ohun ti o dara.
We got up in the morning and thought about it.	A dide ni owurọ ki o ro ero rẹ.
Let’s add that to our table.	Jẹ ki a fi iyẹn kun tabili wa.
The world would be better without you.	Aye yoo dara ju laisi iwọ.
Or we can sit back and watch.	Tabi ki a joko soke ki a wo.
It's a nice day.	O jẹ ọjọ to dara.
I missed something.	Mo padanu nkankan.
He looked at his watch, got up.	O wo aago rẹ, o dide.
I think they run faster on foot.	Mo ro pe wọn sare diẹ sii ni ẹsẹ.
A week ago, no one heard about it.	Ni ọsẹ kan sẹhin, ko si ẹnikan ti o gbọ nipa rẹ.
But you are probably on the job right now.	Ṣugbọn o ṣee ṣe pe o wa lori iṣẹ ni bayi.
These facts have no major interest here.	Awọn otitọ wọnyi ko ni anfani pataki nibi.
The cat is sleeping.	Ologbo naa ti sun soke.
I will give you nothing.	Emi yoo fun ọ ni ohunkohun.
I have nothing bad to say for those moments.	Emi ko ni nkankan buburu lati sọ fun awọn akoko yẹn.
This is important for two reasons.	Eyi ṣe pataki fun idi meji.
And boy are they out well.	Ati ọmọkunrin ni o wa jade ti o dara.
I have never seen before today.	Emi ko tii ri ṣaaju loni.
He does not know anyone who has such a big heart.	Oun ko mọ ẹnikẹni ti o ni ọkan nla bẹ.
I'll send a picture so you can see.	Emi yoo fi aworan ranṣẹ ki o le rii.
Go find it.	Lọ wa a.
He hopes he never sees the woman again.	O nireti pe ko tun ri obinrin naa mọ.
Here it is! 	Eyi ni!
He has been there a year now.	O ti wa nibẹ ni ọdun kan bayi.
You know that feeling better now.	O mọ pe rilara ti o dara ju ni bayi.
You are not a doctor.	Iwọ kii ṣe dokita.
People are trying to abandon it.	Awọn eniyan n gbiyanju lati kọ ọ silẹ.
All they want is to play.	Gbogbo ohun ti wọn fẹ ni lati ṣe ere.
It makes sense, he thought.	O ṣe oye, o ro.
Both make sense to me.	Mejeeji ni oye fun mi.
No one could have been there at that time.	Ko si ọkan ti o le ti wa nibẹ ni akoko yẹn.
Let me know if it helps.	Jẹ ki mi mọ ti o ba ṣe iranlọwọ.
Can you give me.	Ṣe o le fun mi.
Nice to be able to talk to someone.	O dun lati ni anfani lati ba ẹnikan sọrọ.
The bad weather made me happy.	Oju ojo buburu mu inu mi dun.
Thus, we can do this in a simple or hard way.	Bayi, a le ṣe eyi ni ọna ti o rọrun tabi ọna lile.
This can be found here.	Eleyi le ṣee ri nibi.
They had three children.	Wọn bi ọmọ mẹta.
You want to.	Ti o fẹ.
At this time he could not eat.	Ni wakati yii ko le jẹun.
Not talking, just pick me up.	Ko sọrọ, o kan gbe mi.
But it doesn’t work here.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣiṣẹ nibi.
There is no time for love.	Ko si akoko fun ife.
Killed in a car accident.	Ti pa ninu ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
A man is known by his company.	A mọ ọkunrin kan nipasẹ ile-iṣẹ rẹ.
It is long and very long.	O gun ati pupọ.
It will not matter.	Kii yoo ṣe pataki.
Either way the system stopped.	Ọna boya eto naa duro.
We have given ourselves our word.	A ti fun ara wa ni ọrọ wa.
Obviously nothing like yours.	O han ni ohunkohun bi tirẹ.
Take two years if you want.	Mu ọdun meji ti o ba fẹ.
I try to do the right thing.	Mo gbiyanju lati ṣe ohun ti o tọ.
The box does not want to open.	Apoti naa ko fẹ lati ṣii.
But he made two good points.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe awọn aaye ti o dara meji.
It can take weeks, months, or years to complete the task.	O le gba awọn ọsẹ, awọn oṣu, tabi ọdun lati pari iṣẹ naa.
That boy was late this afternoon.	Ọmọkunrin yẹn ti pẹ ni ọsan oni.
We'll have someone here in a minute.	A yoo ni ẹnikan nibi ni iṣẹju kan.
They are not the best.	Wọn ko dara ju.
There are others as well.	Awọn miiran tun wa.
This saves everyone time.	Eleyi fi gbogbo eniyan akoko.
None of the lost money has been found yet.	Ko si ọkan ninu owo ti o padanu ti a ti rii sibẹsibẹ.
I will never forget.	Nko gbagbe rara.
It was a nice time.	O je kan dara akoko.
O le, o le.	O le, o le.
Through this dog you know love.	Nipasẹ aja yii o mọ ifẹ.
But that is not all.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe iyẹn nikan.
It made some stop.	O ṣe diẹ ninu awọn ti o duro.
The sister will let you think what you want.	Arabinrin naa yoo jẹ ki o ronu ohun ti o fẹ.
Nothing special about that.	Ko si ohun pataki nipa ti.
No one thought to do that before, either.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ronu lati ṣe iyẹn tẹlẹ, boya.
Anything that wasn’t important anymore.	Ohunkohun ti o je ko ni pataki mọ.
That's not what I want.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti Mo fẹ.
He sold out.	O ta jade.
Neither the one who put it there nor the one who knew it was there.	Bẹni ẹniti o fi sii nibẹ tabi ẹniti o mọ pe o wa nibẹ.
You want to go.	O fẹ lọ.
Stop and listen.	Duro ki o gbọ.
Let's not talk about that.	Jẹ ki a ma sọrọ nipa iyẹn.
That was nothing.	Ti o wà ohunkohun.
But only the ear.	Sugbon nikan eti.
I'm sorry.	Ma binu.
I’m good for your money, and for more.	Mo dara fun owo rẹ, ati fun diẹ sii.
Could not have worked.	Ko le ti ṣiṣẹ.
He started trying to sell his pictures.	O bẹrẹ si gbiyanju lati ta awọn aworan rẹ.
Little ever makes sense.	Kekere lailai ṣe ori.
You do not have to move.	O ko ni lati gbe.
He couldn't tell her, he couldn't let her see.	Ko le sọ fun u, ko le jẹ ki o rii.
The store is full of beautiful clothes.	Ile itaja naa kun fun awọn aṣọ lẹwa.
See if this is also true.	Wo boya eyi tun jẹ otitọ.
And that is why there is no life.	Ati pe eyi ni idi ti ko ni aye.
Fire can keep us warm.	Ina le mu wa gbona.
The school does not have enough facilities.	Ile-iwe naa ko ni awọn ohun elo to to.
I know some people are looking for that.	Mo mọ pe awọn eniyan kan n wa iyẹn.
So, it’s a big reason.	Nitorina, o jẹ idi nla.
Now you can think.	Bayi o ti le ronu.
Things are not good.	Awọn nkan ko dara.
He saw two men coming out of the house as he entered.	O ri awọn ọkunrin meji ti o jade kuro ni ile bi o ti wọ.
I can't get out.	Nko le jade.
Because there was something to do.	Nitori nibẹ wà nkankan lati se.
Let's stay home.	Jẹ ki a duro si ile.
We take that very seriously.	A mu iyẹn ni pataki.
It got me in trouble.	O gba mi ni wahala.
Of course you can see it is correct.	Dajudaju o le rii pe o tọ.
This is all true.	Eyi jẹ otitọ gbogbo.
You will be true to your friends and to yourself.	Iwọ yoo jẹ otitọ si awọn ọrẹ rẹ ati fun ararẹ.
Not when it is not physical.	Ko ṣe nigba ti ko wa nipa ti ara.
Go love baby.	Lọ nifẹ ọmọ.
We have only today.	A ni nikan loni.
The sister would have almost seen this for sure.	Arabinrin naa yoo ti fẹrẹ rii eyi dajudaju.
But that is good, such a life is long overdue.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn dara, iru aye bẹẹ ti pẹ ni bayi.
Not in the phone book.	Ko si ninu iwe foonu.
And your love.	Ati ifẹ rẹ.
Things have to change, and they will.	Awọn nkan ni lati yipada, ati pe wọn yoo.
I think you mean what you say.	Mo ro pe o tumọ si ohun ti o sọ.
No, that's not right.	Rara, iyẹn ko tọ.
Definitely in a way you don’t already know.	Daju ni ọna ti ko mọ tẹlẹ.
He will not go.	Oun ko ni lọ.
Today is your first birthday.	Loni ni ọjọ ibi akọkọ rẹ.
The woman or her home is still unknown.	Obinrin naa tabi ile rẹ ko tii mọ.
And then the food came.	Ati lẹhin naa ounjẹ naa wa.
We can't say anything.	A ko le sọ nkankan.
It takes me down a bit.	O gba mi ni isalẹ diẹ.
Play with other children.	Mu ṣiṣẹ pẹlu awọn ọmọ miiran.
Both players will lose.	Mejeeji awọn ẹrọ orin yoo padanu.
Make it interesting.	Ṣe awọn ti o awon.
I love doing something artistic.	Mo nifẹ lati ṣe nkan iṣẹ ọna miiran.
Do whatever you want there.	Ṣe ohunkohun ti o fẹ nibẹ.
It exhausted me in the end.	O rẹ mi ni ipari.
Pa a!	Pa a!
Soon, he believed he would never see her again.	Laipẹ sẹhin, o gbagbọ pe oun ko ni ri oun mọ.
But since then things have changed a lot.	Ṣugbọn lati igba naa awọn nkan ti yipada pupọ.
Not just for yourself, but for your daughter.	Kii ṣe fun ara rẹ nikan, ṣugbọn fun ọmọbirin rẹ.
Not in this table.	Ko si ni tabili yii.
Today that has changed.	Loni iyẹn yipada.
If anything good there, we will know about it.	Ti nkan ba dara nibẹ, a yoo mọ nipa rẹ.
I am not hungry at all.	Ebi ko pa mi rara.
We must return and receive.	A gbọdọ pada ki o gba.
I would like to buy a house.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ra ile kan.
That is the key for me.	Iyẹn ni bọtini fun mi.
This has become a very beautiful thing.	Eyi ti di ohun ti o lẹwa pupọ.
They have changed.	Wọn ti yipada.
The mother sits on the bed, watching her baby grow.	Iya naa joko lori ibusun, o n wo ọmọ rẹ ti o dagba.
He picked up his bag to leave.	O gbe apo rẹ lati lọ kuro.
Both are young, so everything is fine.	Awọn mejeeji jẹ ọdọ, nitorina ohun gbogbo dara.
I can not understand why it does not work.	Emi ko le mọ idi ti ko ṣiṣẹ.
You have to do it all yourself.	O gbọdọ ṣe gbogbo rẹ funrararẹ.
It's a good idea, really.	O jẹ imọran ti o dara, ni otitọ.
They get it.	Wọn gba a.
Complete the test.	Pari idanwo naa.
It stands for what is right.	O duro fun ohun ti o tọ.
In the end you will wonder why you are always afraid of them.	Ni ipari iwọ yoo ṣe iyalẹnu idi ti o fi bẹru wọn lailai.
He hesitated, and said my name.	O ṣiyemeji, o si sọ orukọ mi.
I have no problem with it.	Emi ko ni iṣoro pẹlu rẹ.
It was a small hand, and very hot.	O jẹ ọwọ kekere kan, o si gbona pupọ.
It's a big house.	Ile nla ni.
He is just an amazing person.	O kan jẹ eniyan iyanu.
However they can leave us.	Sibẹsibẹ wọn le fi wa silẹ.
Okay, that's good.	O dara, iyẹn dara.
You will not believe what happened today.	Iwọ kii yoo gbagbọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ loni.
Contact books if needed.	Kan si awọn iwe ohun ti o ba nilo.
When he came back he did not do well.	Nigbati o pada wa ko ṣe daradara.
He usually has no problems with women.	Nigbagbogbo o ko ni iṣoro pẹlu awọn obinrin.
He hated it.	O korira rẹ.
We need to change the word.	A nilo lati yi ọrọ naa pada.
But you have already heard.	Ṣugbọn o ti gbọ tẹlẹ.
I'm just telling you it's the same.	Mo kan n sọ fun ọ pe oun kan naa ni.
That may be the first time.	Iyẹn le jẹ igba akọkọ.
We do not have to stay here.	A ko ni lati duro nibi.
She looked at the doctor.	O wo dokita naa.
The police are at the station here.	Awọn ọlọpa wa ni ibudo nibi.
Have you heard that?	Njẹ o ti gbọ iyẹn?
You want it with you.	O fẹ rẹ pẹlu rẹ.
And of course my family is not alone.	Ati pe dajudaju idile mi kii ṣe nikan.
Dogs are full of energy and live at the same time.	Awọn aja kun fun agbara ati gbe ni akoko naa.
We drove to the main house.	A wakọ si ile akọkọ.
They all left here a good while in the past.	Gbogbo wọn fi silẹ nibi kan ti o dara nigba ti o ti kọja.
He refused to break the book.	O kọ lati fọ iwe naa.
He was angry with himself.	O binu si ara rẹ.
The buildings are originally two high-rise buildings.	Awọn ile jẹ akọkọ awọn ile nla meji ga.
What about.	Kini nipa.
He raised his eyes to hers.	O gbe oju rẹ si oju rẹ.
You have enough time.	O ni akoko ti o to.
You can do whatever you need.	O le ṣe ohunkohun ti o nilo.
He would not want to.	Kii yoo fẹ.
It will be so here.	Yoo jẹ bẹ nibi.
Everyone lives this way.	Gbogbo eniyan n gbe ni ọna yii.
This is how it is done.	Bayi ni o ṣe ṣe.
Can't get enough paper.	Ko le gba to iwe.
He looked back at her hand.	O wo pada ni ọwọ rẹ.
From my late father.	Lati odo baba mi ti o ku.
It took a lot.	O mu pupọ.
The dress is nice.	Aṣọ naa dara.
But that is not what happened.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
I am writing their names on my hand.	Mo n kọ orukọ wọn si ọwọ mi.
He is a very good man.	O jẹ eniyan ti o dara gaan.
Is anyone there?	Ṣe ẹnikẹni wa nibẹ?
I like it.	Mo dabi rẹ.
When he returned, it was too late.	Nigbati o pada, o ti pẹ ju.
I have been watching it for an hour.	Mo ti n wo o fun wakati kan.
And they’ll see even more.	Ati pe wọn yoo rii paapaa.
Something like this and this.	Nkankan bi eyi ati eyi.
It has metal bodies.	O ni awọn ara ti irin.
An hour to kill.	Wakati kan lati pa.
They have to let me go, whether they like it or not.	Wọn ni lati jẹ ki mi lọ, boya wọn fẹ tabi rara.
You can decide whether or not to wear them.	O le pinnu boya tabi kii ṣe wọ wọn.
She was scared.	O bẹru.
Your friend has accepted all the facts.	Ọrẹ rẹ ti gba gbogbo awọn otitọ.
When he finished things to say, it was too late.	Nigbati o pari awọn nkan lati sọ, o ti pẹ.
It's not very sweet.	Ko dun pupọ.
He took her to the store.	O gbe e lọ si ile itaja.
Whatever your circumstances are, fine.	Ohunkohun ti awọn ipo rẹ jẹ, o dara.
The world will know what happened.	Aye yoo mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
You must have had a special meeting.	O gbọdọ ti ni ipade pataki kan.
For me it is very important to help people.	Fun mi o ṣe pataki gaan lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun eniyan.
Great power is already here.	Agbara nla wa nibi tẹlẹ.
At first look and see.	Ni akọkọ wo ati wo.
From my sister.	Lati arabinrin mi.
I don't like that.	Emi ko fẹran iyẹn.
They may try to come.	Wọn le gbiyanju lati wa.
He will go to school.	Oun yoo lọ si ile-iwe.
You may be one of those people.	O le jẹ ọkan ninu awọn eniyan naa.
Our history has shown that.	Itan wa ti fi idi rẹ han bẹ.
He and his father would hear the story.	Oun ati baba rẹ yoo gbọ itan naa.
Take some time to read about it here.	Gba akoko diẹ lati ka nipa rẹ nibi.
Games do it for you.	Awọn ere ṣe o fun o.
He is higher than I am.	O ga ju mi ​​lọ.
We are here for them only.	A ti wa nibi fun wọn nikan.
Run the program and wait for a while.	Ṣiṣe eto naa ki o duro fun igba diẹ.
She washes her clothes in river water.	O maa n fọ aṣọ rẹ ni omi odo.
You want to live in that house.	O fẹ lati gbe ni ile yẹn.
I learned a lot from her.	Mo kọ ẹkọ pupọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
Don’t think about anything that happened last week.	Maṣe ronu nipa ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni ọsẹ to kọja.
Just that the girl is here.	O kan pe ọmọbirin naa wa nibi.
In fact, it looks like an open house.	Ni otitọ, o dabi ile ti o ṣii.
It depends on your job.	O da lori iṣẹ rẹ.
I have to do something.	Mo ni lati se nkankan.
But, this is nothing new.	Ṣugbọn, eyi kii ṣe nkan tuntun.
But it went on edge.	Ṣugbọn o lọ lori eti.
But it was as long as a football field.	Sugbon o je bi gun bi a bọọlu aaye.
But you can wait.	Ṣugbọn o le duro.
I lost money.	Mo padanu owo.
Must buy together to sit together.	Gbọdọ ra papọ lati joko papọ.
She is the kind of girl that every boy pays attention to.	O jẹ iru ọmọbirin ti gbogbo ọmọkunrin ṣe akiyesi si.
Put yourself in their shoes.	Fi ara rẹ sinu bata wọn.
On the missing day.	Ni ọjọ ti o padanu.
And so here.	Ati bẹ nibi.
At least, not too much time.	O kere ju, kii ṣe pupọ julọ akoko.
You don’t hate it.	O ko korira rẹ.
I think it is good for a phone.	Mo ro pe o dara fun foonu kan.
But it is known to exist.	Sugbon o ti wa ni mo lati tẹlẹ.
We tried and tried and tried.	A gbiyanju ati gbiyanju ati gbiyanju.
She decided to have a baby herself.	O pinnu lati bi ọmọ kan funrararẹ.
It was my first time out there.	O je mi igba akọkọ jade nibẹ.
So the picture is in the outdoor area.	Nitorina aworan naa wa ni agbegbe ita gbangba.
Let us all do this as well as possible.	Jẹ ki gbogbo wa ṣe eyi daradara bi o ti ṣee.
He kept his feet.	O pa ẹsẹ rẹ mọ.
You think that's the best they can hope for.	O ro pe iyẹn dara julọ ti wọn le nireti fun.
I love you.	Mo ṣe ifẹ si ọ.
I just live with my wife.	Mo kan gbe pẹlu iyawo mi.
When the time comes, he will need it.	Nigbati akoko ba to, oun yoo nilo rẹ.
I do not know how.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe ṣe.
I want you to tell me everything.	Mo fẹ ki o sọ ohun gbogbo fun mi.
He went out on the road.	O jade lọ ni opopona.
Every eye is over.	Gbogbo oju wo ni o kọja.
Everything has a time and place.	Ohun gbogbo ni akoko ati aaye kan.
You need to go.	O nilo lati lọ.
Same thing every year.	Ohun kanna ni gbogbo ọdun.
We know how to come back.	A mọ bi a ṣe le pada wa.
This time we will reach an agreement.	Akoko yi a yoo de ọdọ adehun.
I never spend money on myself.	Emi ko lo owo lori ara mi rara.
When will we be released again? 	Nigbawo ni a yoo tun fi wa silẹ?
their eyes asked.	oju wọn beere.
And and and.	Ati ati ati.
You can see that on your work.	O le rii iyẹn lori iṣẹ rẹ.
I don’t mean any of it.	Emi ko tumọ si eyikeyi ninu rẹ.
But those plans changed.	Ṣugbọn awọn eto yẹn yipada.
He broke them, he bound them.	O fọ wọn kuro, o di wọn jade.
All names have been changed.	Gbogbo awọn orukọ ti yipada.
This is a mistake.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
It is dead easy to use and works well.	O ti ku rọrun lati lo ati pe o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
But it is not, you know, not always.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe, o mọ, kii ṣe nigbagbogbo.
It has nothing to do with it.	Ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
I did the same.	Mo tun ṣe bẹ.
They have money.	Won ni owo.
Receive any gift.	Gba eyikeyi ẹbun.
Something is in their eyes.	Nkankan wa ni oju wọn.
You may hate it.	O le korira rẹ.
I just can't believe it.	Mo kan ko le gbagbọ.
Life changed after that.	Igbesi aye yipada lẹhin iyẹn.
I run every day.	Mo ṣiṣe ni gbogbo ọjọ.
This thing is long.	Nkan yii gun.
He got out of the car, picked up a big box.	O jade lati inu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ, o gbe apoti nla kan.
You don’t let your child change.	O ko jẹ ki ọmọ rẹ yipada.
I'll take it.	Emi yoo mu u.
I got out of it.	Mo jade ninu rẹ.
No one really knew when the first cities came out.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ gaan nigbati awọn ilu akọkọ ti jade.
Again, it is written.	Lẹẹkansi, o ti kọ.
You know it doesn’t.	O mọ pe ko ni.
You need to know if it is used.	O nilo lati mọ boya o ti lo.
Good, not bad.	O dara, ko dara.
I fear it.	Mo bẹru rẹ.
Bad for him.	Buburu fun u.
We see that it certainly does not matter.	A rii pe o daju pe ko ṣe pataki.
A new student starts at school.	Ọmọ ile-iwe tuntun kan bẹrẹ ni ile-iwe.
The temperature is almost gone.	Otutu ti fẹrẹ lọ.
I love working on it.	Mo nifẹ ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ.
Good things to think about.	Awọn nkan ti o dara lati ronu nipa.
It's in me.	O wa ninu mi.
If you watch that game you have caught me.	Ti o ba wo ere yẹn o ti mu mi mọ.
Nothing for him.	Ko si nkankan fun u.
I got it.	Mo ti gba.
But this does not mean that it should not be said.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko tumọ si pe ko yẹ ki o sọ.
She lost her hair.	O padanu irun rẹ.
I should just do it.	Mo yẹ ki o kan ṣe.
To some extent this is true.	Si iye kan eyi jẹ otitọ.
In the letter.	Ninu lẹta naa.
Only you and I are now.	Iwọ ati emi nikan ni bayi.
You can see it forever.	O le ri lailai.
It’s more.	O jẹ diẹ sii.
He started calling me and changing me.	O bẹrẹ si pe mi ki o si yi mi pada.
But he never asked me about it.	Ṣugbọn ko beere lọwọ mi nipa rẹ.
They never did.	Wọn ko tun ṣe bẹ.
How great for him.	Bawo ni nla fun u.
I would be happy to help you today.	Emi yoo dun lati ran ọ lọwọ loni.
We write for ourselves why.	A kọ fun ara wa idi.
Okay, that's all for today.	O dara, iyẹn ni gbogbo fun oni.
You will find your money in it.	Iwọ yoo wa owo rẹ ninu.
How did you get that idea?	Bawo ni o ṣe gba imọran naa?
I said no.	Mo sọ pe kii ṣe bẹ.
We are looking for special equipment.	A n wa ohun elo pataki.
He made himself at rest.	O ṣe ara rẹ ni isinmi.
I don't want to see this.	Emi ko fẹ lati ri eyi.
Or it is repeated as either.	Tabi o ti wa ni tun bi boya.
You have never told this story to anyone before.	Iwọ ko ti sọ itan yii fun ẹnikẹni tẹlẹ.
The weather is also warm, and the water is very sweet.	Oju ojo tun gbona, ati pe omi naa dun pupọ.
It has since been placed on the bed.	O ni lati igba ti o ti gbe e lori ibusun.
He has not touched me yet.	Ko tii ṣe oju kan mi sibẹsibẹ.
Conscience.	Ọkan.
Than we hate the truth.	Ju a korira otitọ.
Know that he will come back.	Mọ pe yoo pada wa.
I have to get out of here.	Mo ni lati jade ni ibi.
It's too hot.	Ibi ti o gbona ni.
He did not do it on purpose.	Ko ṣe e lori idi.
We also visited some water points.	A tun ṣabẹwo si awọn aaye omi diẹ.
These are.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn.
A kitten tries to catch its tail.	Ọmọ ologbo kan gbiyanju lati mu iru rẹ.
The car is brand new.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ jẹ tuntun.
It has been very good for me.	O ti dara pupọ fun mi.
He was with me, even when he was not going.	O wa pẹlu mi, paapaa nigbati o ko lọ.
The sound went out of sight on the trees.	Ohun naa lọ kuro ni oju lori awọn igi.
The train had just arrived when the accident happened.	Ọkọ oju irin naa ti fẹrẹ de nigbati ijamba naa ṣẹlẹ.
And maybe they do.	Ati boya wọn ṣe.
Those pictures are his life.	Awọn aworan yẹn jẹ igbesi aye rẹ.
Just don’t try it.	O kan maṣe gbiyanju rẹ.
You can go to this place.	O le lo si ibi yii.
Possibly, though.	O ṣee ṣe, paapaa.
This happens the next morning.	Eyi ṣẹlẹ ni owurọ lẹhin owurọ.
Maybe to the means.	Boya si awọn ọna.
You will have so.	O yoo ni bẹ.
I do not have time.	Emi ko ni akoko.
Everyone is great with it.	Gbogbo eniyan ni nla pẹlu rẹ.
He will know whether he has.	Oun yoo mọ boya o ni.
Everyone thought he would never come back.	Gbogbo eniyan ro pe oun ko ni pada wa.
Not shown.	Ko han.
We feel the same way about music.	A lero ni ọna kanna nipa orin.
I love those stories.	Mo nifẹ awọn itan yẹn.
Often well.	Igba o daradara.
I know you.	Mo mọ ọ.
Let's do this.	Jẹ ki a ṣe eyi.
In fact it is one.	Ni otitọ o jẹ ọkan.
We don’t get out of here.	A ko gba jade ti ibi.
But, for now.	Ṣugbọn, fun bayi.
Do you remember.	Ṣe o ranti.
And forever it will be.	Ati lailai yoo jẹ.
I asked again.	Mo tun beere.
He wanted something less than sleep.	O fe nkankan kere ju lati sun.
She wants you to wash your hair.	O fẹ ki o fo irun rẹ.
Obviously, this is not entirely true.	O han ni, eyi kii ṣe otitọ patapata.
Anything we can think of.	Ohunkohun ti a le ro ti.
But two months ago he received a letter.	Ṣugbọn oṣu meji sẹhin o gba lẹta kan.
Think you are here to do that.	Ro pe o wa nibi lati ṣe iyẹn.
Good.	O dara.
Who will take care of our children?	Tani yoo tọju awọn ọmọ wa?
I use my phone to help with your face.	Mo lo foonu mi lati ṣe iranlọwọ pẹlu oju rẹ.
Just know that we have run into the car.	O kan mọ pe a ti sare sinu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
I really like it at times, but not so much in others.	Mo nifẹ rẹ gaan ni awọn akoko, ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ ni awọn miiran.
However, a possible problem with your application may be its conclusion.	Sibẹsibẹ, iṣoro kan ti o ṣeeṣe pẹlu ohun elo rẹ le jẹ ipari rẹ.
Help me to listen.	Ran mi lọwọ lati gbọ.
Lots of people come to me with back problems.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan wa si mi pẹlu awọn iṣoro pada.
I would be fine with it.	Emi yoo dara pẹlu rẹ.
We are doing our best.	A n ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
You think you know everything about them.	O ro pe o mọ ohun gbogbo nipa wọn.
This is the right idea.	Eyi jẹ imọran ti o tọ.
This is my question.	Eyi ni ibeere mi.
Make yourself a meal.	Ṣe ara rẹ ni ounjẹ.
This article is on this site.	Ọrọ yii wa lori aaye yii.
But every time he ate, he stopped.	Ṣugbọn ni gbogbo igba ti o jẹun, o da silẹ.
I went out of the garden.	Mo jade ninu ọgba.
What does that have to do.	Kini iyẹn ni lati ṣe.
No one seemed to agree.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o dabi ẹni pe o gba.
Do you believe they are right?	Ṣe o gbagbọ pe wọn tọ?
We have no time.	A ko ni akoko.
It stands for more.	O duro fun diẹ sii.
No one is in sight.	Ko si ẹnikan ni oju.
We stayed for a week.	A duro fun ọsẹ kan.
This story kept me up at night.	Itan yi pa mi soke ni alẹ.
It went well for more than an hour.	O lọ fun daradara ju wakati kan lọ.
It makes no sense to leave home with the coming night.	Ko ṣe oye lati lọ kuro ni ile pẹlu alẹ ti n bọ.
I made a new contract.	Mo ṣe adehun tuntun kan.
I just took it.	Mo kan mu u.
We lost ourselves and we were there.	A padanu ara wa ati pe a wa nibẹ.
It all means something.	Gbogbo rẹ tumọ si nkankan.
A book is about to go.	Iwe kan ti fẹ lọ.
They are used to such things.	Wọn ti lo si iru awọn nkan bẹẹ.
At that time it was either your work or your journey.	Ni akoko yẹn o jẹ boya iṣẹ rẹ tabi irin-ajo rẹ.
This is also your home.	Eyi tun jẹ ile rẹ.
They are two understandings.	Wọn jẹ awọn oye meji.
That work means walking more.	Iṣẹ yẹn tumọ si rin diẹ sii.
But they do this manually, and so it is more.	Ṣugbọn wọn ṣe eyi pẹlu ọwọ, ati nitori naa o jẹ diẹ sii.
We change a price to decide, taxes or similar.	A yi owo kan pada lati pinnu, awọn ori tabi iru.
And even he has written only two books.	Ati paapaa o ti kọ awọn iwe meji nikan.
Wondering to think about.	Iyalẹnu lati ronu nipa.
He went on the side.	O si lọ lori ẹgbẹ.
You will not understand.	Iwọ kii yoo loye.
I hate it here.	Mo korira nibi.
All of this is in the works, but it takes time.	Gbogbo eyi wa ninu awọn iṣẹ, ṣugbọn o gba akoko.
What he did was amazing.	Ohun ti o ṣe jẹ iyalẹnu.
The question is who started your position.	Ibeere ni tani o bẹrẹ ni ipo rẹ.
If it is true it is very important to lose.	Ti o ba jẹ otitọ otitọ jẹ pataki pupọ lati padanu.
Materials and men.	Awọn ohun elo ati awọn ọkunrin.
I know this is true for myself.	Mo mọ pe eyi jẹ otitọ fun ara mi.
All this information is made public.	Gbogbo alaye yi ti wa ni gbangba.
There must be some kind of intellectual information.	Iru alaye ọgbọn kan gbọdọ wa.
Everyone wants to talk about it.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ lati sọrọ nipa rẹ.
No need to tell me again.	Ko nilo lati sọ fun mi lẹẹkansi.
The story is changing.	Itan naa n yipada.
But when you think about it, it’s a really big one.	Ṣugbọn nigbati o ba ronu nipa rẹ, o jẹ nla kan gaan.
I see value in it that others don’t.	Mo rii iye ninu rẹ pe awọn miiran ko ṣe.
We agree with you.	A gba pẹlu rẹ.
Find someone to help.	Wa ẹnikan lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
We know it, because we have been forced to learn.	A mọ ọ, nitori a ti fi agbara mu lati kọ ẹkọ.
I was, like, we thought all this stuff.	Mo jẹ, bii, a ronu gbogbo nkan yii.
No, you are making one for yourself.	Rara, o n ṣe ọkan fun ara rẹ.
But that would not be true.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii yoo jẹ otitọ.
This is our plan.	Eyi ni eto wa.
I am hungry!	Ebi n pa mi!
You have one position.	O ni ipo ọkan.
And look at me.	Ati ki o wo mi.
I have to stay there for the time being.	Mo gbọdọ duro nibẹ fun akoko naa.
I want it.	Mo fe e.
Our services are great to help you.	Awọn iṣẹ wa jẹ nla pupọ lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ.
He saw something.	O ri nkankan.
It looks like that here.	O dabi iyẹn nibi.
If you expect bad things, you will have bad things.	Ti o ba nireti awọn ohun buburu, iwọ yoo ni awọn ohun buburu.
Cannot see or touch.	Ko le ri tabi fi ọwọ kan.
My mother, however, is another story.	Iya mi, sibẹsibẹ, jẹ itan miiran.
They have done it.	Wọn ti ṣe e.
There is no way we missed this.	Ko si ọna ti a padanu eyi.
Obviously, you have every reason to believe that this child is not yours.	O han ni, o ni gbogbo idi lati gbagbọ pe ọmọ yii kii ṣe tirẹ.
The last thing you need is to get past it now.	Ohun ikẹhin ti o nilo ni lati kọja ni bayi.
This is the end result.	Eyi ni ipari ipari.
Here are some suggestions on what to look for.	Eyi ni diẹ ninu awọn imọran nipa ohun ti a n wa.
Still looking good.	Si tun wo dara.
He did not like his father.	Ko feran baba re.
You can not understand.	O ko le loye.
It was outside.	Ita wà ita.
You have to hope that it is not possible to hear it.	O ni lati nireti pe ko ṣee ṣe lati gbọ rẹ.
He believed in taking advantage of all the opportunities.	O gbagbọ lati lo anfani gbogbo awọn anfani.
What happened, happened.	Kini o ṣẹlẹ, ṣẹlẹ.
It is best to spend some time early.	Dara julọ lati lo akoko diẹ ni kutukutu.
Do not let any of you sleep in a friend's house.	Maṣe jẹ ki ẹnikẹni ninu yin sun ni ile ọrẹ kan.
It hurt my son.	O jẹ ọmọ mi ni ipalara.
Everyone has a car.	Gbogbo eniyan ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
She decided not to go.	O pinnu lati ko lọ.
I need less.	Mo nilo kere si.
Eventually it started to happen in a few days.	Ni ipari o bẹrẹ si ṣẹlẹ ni awọn ọjọ diẹ.
Now is your time to make one.	Bayi ni akoko rẹ lati ṣe ọkan.
One of the boys came with that name.	Ọkan ninu awọn ọmọkunrin wa pẹlu orukọ naa.
He could never know.	Oun ko le mọ rara.
At least you can see.	O kere o le rii.
But wait for an hour.	Ṣugbọn duro fun wakati kan.
I am at your service.	Mo wa ni iṣẹ rẹ.
Things are getting better.	Nkan ti n dara si.
I want to contact you.	Mo fẹ lati kan si rẹ.
It is down a bit again.	O ti wa ni isalẹ diẹ lẹẹkansi.
We don't see who he really is.	A ko rii ẹni ti o jẹ gaan.
It's not over yet.	Ko tii pari.
But that’s not the way it is anymore.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe ọna ti o jẹ mọ.
They want to.	Wọn fẹ.
I do not know how, but it is.	Emi ko mọ bi, ṣugbọn o jẹ.
I almost never let him touch me.	Emi ko fẹrẹ jẹ ki o fi ọwọ kan mi.
Every woman deserves to be a mother.	Gbogbo obinrin ni o tọ lati jẹ iya.
I thought to myself.	Mo ro ara mi.
But in many ways, the error is my own.	Ṣugbọn ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna, aṣiṣe jẹ ti ara mi.
I could drop around and find her at work.	Mo ti le ju ni ayika ati ki o ri rẹ ni ibi iṣẹ.
He lives everywhere alone.	O ngbe nibi gbogbo nikan.
I think they are gone.	Mo ro pe wọn ti lọ.
Some even do not want me to call them.	Diẹ ninu awọn paapaa ko fẹ ki n pe wọn.
Convinced of this, he left home.	Ni idaniloju eyi, o fi ile silẹ.
But not a whole lot.	Sugbon ko kan gbogbo pupo.
But wait a minute.	Ṣugbọn duro lori iṣẹju kan.
I could have left my house.	Mo ti le kuro ni ile mi.
Please try to contact him again.	Jọwọ gbiyanju lati kan si i lẹẹkansi.
There is a time to love.	Akoko wa lati nifẹ.
You can live by.	O le gbe nipa.
I do not like to see there.	Emi ko fẹran ri nibẹ.
He did not tell anyone.	Ko sọ fun ẹnikẹni.
My last and first names mean something to me.	Awọn orukọ ti o kẹhin ati akọkọ mi tumọ si nkankan fun mi.
It has really hit me in my own game.	O ti lu mi ni otitọ ni ere ti ara mi.
They spend their lives as their parents did.	Wọn lo aye wọn bi awọn obi wọn ṣe.
Add water if needed all this time.	Fi omi kun ti o ba nilo ni gbogbo akoko yii.
Much more about that.	Pupọ diẹ nipa iyẹn.
It is a promise.	O jẹ ileri kan.
That caught your attention.	Iyẹn gba akiyesi rẹ.
Children are the future of tomorrow.	Awọn ọmọde ni ojo iwaju ti ọla.
He said it was good.	O sọ pe o dara.
Not that you have seen this face.	Kii ṣe pe o ti rii oju yii.
Not that this is so easy.	Kii ṣe pe eyi jẹ ki o rọrun.
That should be a matter of law.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o jẹ ọrọ ti ofin.
The car is speeding.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa n sare.
So they told me.	Nitorina wọn sọ fun mi.
I can not get it anymore.	Nko le gba mo.
I agree with the police.	Mo gba pẹlu ọlọpa.
It sells two kinds.	O ta meji iru.
I need to be like everyone else.	Mo nilo lati dabi gbogbo eniyan miiran.
The device.	Ẹrọ naa.
But you will not.	Ṣugbọn iwọ kii yoo.
I just did not accept this family.	Mo kan ko gba idile yii.
You have to do something.	O ni lati se nkankan.
And they seem to work well.	Ati pe wọn dabi pe wọn ṣiṣẹ daradara.
I am the new girl.	Emi ni ọmọbirin tuntun naa.
He said the same thing to her.	O sọ ohun kanna fun u.
Her children did not like her very much.	Awọn ọmọ rẹ ko fẹran rẹ pupọ.
We will see them.	A yoo ri wọn.
And he did not know that he knew.	Ati pe ko mọ pe o mọ.
Our lives are worth more than that.	Igbesi aye wa ni iye diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
And that did not happen.	Ati pe iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ.
The sun was just rising.	Oorun ti kan bọ soke.
He seems angry about our situation.	O dabi pe o binu nipa ipo wa.
There is no water at all.	Ko si omi kankan rara.
Not long.	Ko pe gun.
I must say.	Mo gbọdọ sọ.
But he could not say that.	Ṣugbọn ko le sọ iyẹn.
And most importantly.	Ati pataki julọ.
And that is the work that we are doing right now.	Ati pe iyẹn ni iṣẹ ti a n ṣe ni bayi.
They are on it.	Wọn wa lori rẹ.
You are not happy.	Inu re ko dun.
Most people use it.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan lo.
Because that's what you're going to do.	Nitori ohun ti o yoo ṣe niyẹn.
There are pictures of me.	Awọn aworan mi wa.
But first things first.	Sugbon akọkọ ohun akọkọ.
It can be a good deal.	O le jẹ adehun ti o dara.
My father sang.	Baba mi kọ orin.
Either way, we are here to help as always.	Ọna boya, a wa nibi lati ṣe iranlọwọ bi nigbagbogbo.
You have to stay with it to the end.	O ni lati duro pẹlu rẹ si ipari.
And that would say something.	Ati pe iyẹn yoo sọ nkankan.
I am very afraid of him.	Mo n bẹru pupọ fun u.
You have never met her before.	O ko tii pade rẹ rara.
This is their money.	Eyi ni owo wọn.
They should be there one day.	Wọn yẹ ki o wa nibẹ ni ọjọ kan.
Very good in it.	O dara pupọ ninu rẹ.
We have what you need.	A ni ohun ti o nilo.
Please do not do so.	Jọwọ maṣe jẹ bẹ.
Nothing special now.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni bayi.
Engage yourself.	Ṣe ara rẹ lọwọ.
And we have heard it.	Ati pe a ti gbọ rẹ.
The word here is similar.	Ọrọ naa nibi jẹ iru.
I hope you will produce.	Mo nireti pe iwọ yoo gbe awọn.
You know more now.	O mọ diẹ sii ni bayi.
You want them to know you are there, too.	O fẹ ki wọn mọ pe o wa nibẹ, paapaa.
Not just because he has grown up.	Kii ṣe nitori pe o ti dagba nikan.
Much more than that.	Pupọ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
See, we will figure this out.	Wo, a yoo ro eyi jade.
In fact, do that for about three years.	Ni otitọ, ṣe iyẹn bii ọdun mẹta.
I have a lot of money.	Mo ni owo pupọ.
It seems obvious now.	O dabi enipe o han ni bayi.
I'm better to tell you in person.	Emi yoo dara so fun o ni eniyan.
They both forgot that they were brothers.	Awọn mejeeji gbagbe pe wọn jẹ arakunrin.
Even children understand that.	Paapaa awọn ọmọde ni oye iyẹn.
But time has passed, and history continues.	Ṣugbọn akoko ti kọja, ati itan tẹsiwaju.
Not yet.	Ko sibẹsibẹ.
Say, everyone.	Sọ, gbogbo eniyan.
It has risen.	O ti ga soke.
That said, first try and make a plan.	Ti o sọ, akọkọ gbiyanju ati ṣe eto kan.
I do not agree.	Emi ko gba.
And the seat is finished.	Ati ijoko naa ti pari.
That seems out of place now.	Iyẹn dabi pe o ti jade ni bayi.
It was not an easy decision.	Ko ṣe ipinnu ti o rọrun.
I think my outfit will look great, too.	Mo ro pe aṣọ mi yoo dara julọ, paapaa.
Not his brothers.	Kii ṣe awọn arakunrin rẹ.
More rain is expected tonight.	Ojo diẹ sii ni a nireti ni alẹ oni.
They stopped to listen.	Wọn duro lati gbọ.
I have nothing, man.	Emi ko ni nkankan, eniyan.
But it works really well.	Sugbon o ṣiṣẹ gan daradara.
You see, everyone has ideas.	Ṣe o rii, gbogbo eniyan ni awọn imọran.
But you know.	Ṣugbọn o mọ.
I can find a new job.	Mo le wa iṣẹ tuntun kan.
I might as well not have been there.	Mo le bi daradara ko ti wa nibẹ.
I was serious.	Ina je pataki.
Most children raise one hand.	Pupọ julọ awọn ọmọde gbe ọwọ kan soke.
That is not right.	Iyẹn ko tọ.
Please remove the box.	Jọwọ yọ apoti kuro.
And they can continue without me for a few days.	Ati pe wọn le tẹsiwaju laisi mi fun awọn ọjọ diẹ.
This is a great deal.	Eyi jẹ adehun nla.
If you see it on the road, say something.	Ti o ba ri ni opopona, sọ nkankan.
There is something special about those people.	Nkankan pataki kan wa nipa awọn eniyan yẹn.
It works for us.	O n ṣiṣẹ fun wa.
Everything you want and need to do will also be done.	Ohun gbogbo ti o fẹ ati nilo ṣiṣe yoo tun ṣee ṣe.
Play with friends.	Ṣe ere pẹlu awọn ọrẹ.
My legs lost their ability to hold me.	Ẹsẹ mi padanu agbara wọn lati di mi.
He never left her.	Ko fi i silẹ rara.
And some of the remaining permanent life.	Ati diẹ ninu awọn ti o ku yẹ aye.
Just give it a go !.	Kan fun ni lọ!.
You can do the right thing.	O le ṣe iṣẹ ti o tọ.
I am very happy to be here.	Inu mi dun pupọ lati wa nibi.
We talked a lot.	A sọrọ pupọ.
Lots of trouble.	Pupo wahala.
Many of them mean nothing to my children.	Pupọ ninu wọn ko tumọ nkankan si awọn ọmọ mi.
You look from side to side.	O wo lati ẹgbẹ si ẹgbẹ.
I love this thing so much !.	Mo nifẹ nkan yii ni pataki!.
It’s how you mean to finish.	O jẹ bi o ṣe tumọ si lati pari.
To hurt more people.	Lati ṣe ipalara fun eniyan diẹ sii.
I need my friends.	Mo nilo awọn ọrẹ mi.
That’s all you write!	Iyẹn ni gbogbo ohun ti o kọ!
The new law will take effect next month.	Ofin tuntun naa yoo ṣiṣẹ ni oṣu ti n bọ.
His friends worried about him.	Awọn ọrẹ rẹ ṣe aniyan fun u.
That is very important.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki julọ.
Even now, he does not know why.	Paapaa ni bayi, ko mọ idi.
The sun has set.	Oorun ti wọ.
I still have a lot of them, in those days.	Mo tun ni ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn, ni awọn ọjọ yẹn.
That was a great time in the game.	Iyẹn jẹ akoko nla ninu ere naa.
It really made our day.	O ṣe ọjọ wa gaan.
No one is in the right place.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa ni ibiti o da.
This is not a good idea.	Eyi kii ṣe imọran to dara.
Is there.	O wa nibẹ.
It's really hard to see this.	O jẹ lile gaan lati wo eyi.
The city is gone and it is not too late to know it.	Ilu naa ti lọ ati pe ko ti pẹ diẹ lati mọ ọ.
They have to do something about it.	Wọn ni lati ṣe nkan nipa rẹ.
I do not know why they were bought.	Nko mo idi ti won fi ra won.
I went to the back of the plane.	Mo lọ si ẹhin ọkọ ofurufu naa.
I don’t know why, but that’s sweet.	Emi ko mọ idi rẹ, ṣugbọn iyẹn dun.
Bring your hair back with one hand.	Mu irun rẹ pada pẹlu ọwọ kan.
She is his sister.	Arabinrin rẹ ni.
Or not just with them.	Tabi kii ṣe pẹlu wọn nikan.
I left just to give him some space.	Mo fi silẹ nikan lati fun u ni aaye diẹ.
It was the first time.	O jẹ igba akọkọ.
That was my job as a wife and mother.	Iyẹn ni iṣẹ mi bi iyawo ati iya kan.
I think you can.	Mo ro pe o le.
It is a mistake that you should be here.	O jẹ aṣiṣe pe o yẹ ki o wa nibi.
I am not interested in that idea at all.	Emi ko nifẹ si imọran yẹn rara.
Think about how you can get out.	Ronu bi o ṣe le jade.
Do what you want.	Ṣe ohun ti o fẹ.
It makes me think of myself.	O jẹ ki n ronu ti ara mi.
That is what a woman is.	Ohun ti obinrin je niyen.
He is also in a sleeping house.	O tun wa ni ile ti o sun.
Remember, everything you want, you already have and you are.	Ranti, ohun gbogbo ti o fẹ, o ti ni tẹlẹ ati pe o wa.
You do not have.	O ko ni.
She wanted to ask me about her little sister.	O fẹ lati beere lọwọ mi nipa arabinrin rẹ kekere.
It is a mistake.	O jẹ aṣiṣe.
They are nowhere to be found.	Wọn ko si ibi ti a le rii.
I drink water.	Mo mu omi.
There is a man who has not changed.	Ọkunrin kan wa ti ko yipada.
But they are not happy either.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko dun pẹlu.
It's sweet.	O dun.
Men and women began to lose hair.	Awọn ọkunrin ati awọn obinrin bẹrẹ si padanu irun.
He said it was very true.	O sọ pe otitọ ni pupọ.
Of course not because of poor performance.	Dajudaju kii ṣe nitori iṣẹ ṣiṣe ti ko dara.
Not this time or any other times.	Kii ṣe akoko yii tabi eyikeyi awọn akoko miiran.
He refuses to eat breakfast.	O kọ lati jẹun owurọ.
The children did not say what happened until recently.	Awọn ọmọde ko sọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ titi di igba diẹ.
For the right time.	Fun akoko to tọ.
We have work to do.	A ni ise lati se.
He tried his best.	O gbiyanju ohun ti o dara julọ.
We need rest here.	A nilo isinmi nibi.
I have no place to go back to the room.	Emi ko ni aye lati pada si yara naa.
But it is too late now.	Sugbon o ti pẹ ju bayi.
That is the historical context of the song.	Iyẹn ni ọrọ itan ti orin naa.
Don't take your place.	Maṣe gba aaye rẹ.
However, his story changed.	Sibẹsibẹ, itan rẹ yipada.
Concerned parents visit you every week.	Awọn obi ti o ni aniyan ṣabẹwo si ọdọ rẹ ni gbogbo ọsẹ.
Of course this will not be easy.	Dajudaju eyi kii yoo rọrun.
I am not an art student.	Emi kii ṣe ọmọ ile-iwe aworan.
Nothing you heard changed that.	Ko si ohun ti o gbọ ti o yi iyẹn pada.
He opened the door, looking surprised.	O ṣi ilẹkun, o wo iyalẹnu.
The doctor came to talk to me.	Dokita wa lati ba mi sọrọ.
I am very happy to have that life.	Inu mi dun gaan lati ni aye naa.
People know me.	Eniyan mo mi.
What it is.	Ohun ti o jẹ.
It's a lot.	O je pupo.
John will write with both hands.	John yoo kọ pẹlu ọwọ mejeeji.
And in more ways than one.	Ati ni ọna diẹ sii ju ọkan lọ.
First, because that would mean that things have gone awry.	Ni akọkọ, nitori iyẹn yoo tumọ si pe awọn nkan ti lọ ni aṣiṣe gaan.
We hear there is something else to go.	A n gbọ pe nkan miiran wa lati lọ.
Change my love.	Yi ifẹ mi pada.
And the song.	Ati orin naa.
It stands for something else.	O duro fun ohun miiran.
Or art.	Tabi aworan.
Just think you are right.	O kan ro pe o tọ.
There are ways to say.	Awọn ọna wa lati sọ.
I did not stop.	Emi ko duro ni.
I knew who he was before he reached me.	Mo mọ ẹni ti o jẹ ṣaaju ki o to de ọdọ mi.
Listen to the music.	Gbọ orin naa.
They want what we want.	Wọn fẹ ohun ti a fẹ.
No one has ever been changed.	Ko si ọkan ti a ti yipada lailai.
That is a thing.	Ti o jẹ nkan kan.
I’ve got your back through everything.	Mo ti ni ẹhin rẹ nipasẹ ohun gbogbo.
I know they have nothing against me.	Mo mọ pe wọn ko ni nkankan lori mi.
This should not be done.	Eyi ko yẹ ki o ṣee ṣe.
Anything you have in the house.	Ohunkohun ti o ni ninu ile.
They said nothing and rain for a week.	Won ko so nkankan ati ojo fun ọsẹ kan.
It remains to this day.	O duro titi di oni.
That makes them good or bad.	Iyẹn jẹ ki wọn dara tabi buburu.
I haven't seen you in a while and.	Emi ko ri ọ ni igba diẹ ati.
People are starting to return home to feel it.	Awọn eniyan n bẹrẹ pada si ile lati ni rilara rẹ.
There was a man in his room.	Ọkunrin kan wa ninu yara rẹ.
A girl jumped the rope.	Ọmọbirin kan fo okun.
Two men and a dog.	Awọn ọkunrin meji ati aja kan.
I have a day off today.	Mo ni isinmi ọjọ kan loni.
There is a small family.	Idile kekere wa.
It can be really good.	O le jẹ dara gaan.
Others, not so much.	Awọn miiran, kii ṣe pupọ.
I do not understand what they are feeling.	Emi ko loye ohun ti wọn rilara.
This will not end.	Eyi kii yoo pari.
But they want to give up on it.	Sugbon ti won fe fun soke lori o.
You have interpreted what he said.	O ti tumọ ohun ti o sọ.
He died a little later.	O ku diẹ diẹ.
Everything will be fine.	Ohun gbogbo yoo dara.
It works both ways.	O ṣiṣẹ awọn ọna mejeeji.
When asked why, he said he needed to eat.	Nigbati wọn beere idi rẹ, o sọ pe o nilo lati jẹun.
He asked me for money.	O beere owo fun mi.
You start to take care of yourself.	O bẹrẹ lati tọju ara rẹ.
The situation is great.	Ipo jẹ nla.
I look and do not look at me.	Mo wo ko wo mi.
And that's how it turns out.	Ati awọn ti o ni bi o ti wa ni jade.
I'm sorry they could think that about me.	O binu mi pe wọn le ronu yẹn nipa mi.
Put your father back.	Fi baba rẹ pada.
When do we expect to arrive?	Nigbawo ni a nireti lati de?
I think you read the most.	Mo ro pe o ka julọ.
This has already happened.	Eyi ti ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
Not there.	Ko si nibẹ.
He has worked hard to get to where he is today.	O ti ṣiṣẹ gidigidi lati de ibi ti o wa loni.
Such a person should not be around.	Iru eniyan bẹẹ ko yẹ ki o wa ni ayika.
I learned to think and feel for myself.	Mo kọ ẹkọ lati ronu ati rilara fun ara mi.
I know they will not change like my father.	Mo mọ pe wọn kii yoo yipada bi baba mi.
On their own.	Lori ara wọn.
They do not know what their future holds.	Wọn ko mọ kini ọjọ iwaju wọn jẹ.
I saw it.	Mo ri i.
There is such a thing.	Iru aaye kan wa.
Through pictures they will write words.	Nipasẹ awọn aworan wọn yoo kọ awọn ọrọ.
It contains hard words.	O ni awọn ọrọ lile ninu.
I see you for what it is.	Mo ri ọ fun nkan ti o jẹ.
Another great way.	Ọna miiran ti o dara julọ.
He has no time.	Ko ni akoko.
But no one knows how to do anything about it.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe ohunkohun nipa rẹ.
Most of them can be made at home.	Ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn le ṣee ṣe ni ile.
I will get out of your way during the day.	Emi yoo kuro ni ọna rẹ nigba ọjọ.
No, it is a test.	Rara, o jẹ idanwo.
The opinions of others are irrelevant.	Awọn ero ti awọn miiran ko ṣe pataki.
And the rest will be even better.	Ati isinmi yoo dara julọ paapaa.
At least, not anymore.	O kere ju, kii ṣe mọ.
Many students have dropped out this year.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ti lọ silẹ ni ọdun yii.
They have forgotten how to look at themselves.	Wọn ti gbagbe bi wọn ṣe le wo ara wọn.
That is not really a good idea.	Iyẹn kii ṣe imọran ti o dara julọ gaan.
In fact, it explains everything.	Ni otitọ, o ṣe alaye ohun gbogbo.
Fire means power, in every sense of the word.	Ina tumọ si agbara, ni gbogbo ọna ti ọrọ naa.
Do not let them separate us.	Maṣe jẹ ki wọn ya wa.
Today, you will love it or hate it.	Loni, iwọ yoo fẹran rẹ tabi korira rẹ.
That was enough for me.	Iyẹn ti to fun mi.
All you need to do is pay attention.	Gbogbo ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe ni akiyesi.
It's time to dump her.	O to akoko lati lọ.
You will not sleep much tonight.	Iwọ kii yoo sun pupọ ni alẹ oni.
I lost my dogs.	Mo padanu awọn aja mi.
The police love their rules.	Awọn ọlọpa fẹran awọn ofin wọn.
Let it work for an application that can already be found.	Jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ fun ohun elo ti a le rii tẹlẹ.
This is new to me.	Eyi jẹ tuntun fun mi.
But he was killed when he went to bed.	Ṣugbọn o ti pa a nigbati o lọ si ibusun.
Dad said that was completely impossible, as of course it was.	Baba sọ pe iyẹn ko ṣee ṣe patapata, bi dajudaju o jẹ.
Big problems.	Awọn iṣoro nla.
Like more than any of these things.	Bi diẹ sii ju eyikeyi ninu awọn nkan wọnyi.
Go for the ball and play with both hands.	Lọ fun bọọlu ki o mu pẹlu ọwọ meji.
For many people, that is a long way off.	Fun ọpọlọpọ eniyan, iyẹn jẹ ọna pipẹ.
But still, he did.	Ṣugbọn sibẹsibẹ, o ti ṣe.
You are not like me.	O ko bi mi.
They are not yours.	Wọn kii ṣe tirẹ.
There are several questions.	Awọn ibeere pupọ wa.
However, there is a lot to do in this area.	Sibẹsibẹ, pupọ wa lati ṣe ni agbegbe yii.
He does not seem to care about the problems of his male students.	O dabi pe ko nifẹ si awọn iṣoro awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ọkunrin rẹ.
But it is not so.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ.
No physical problems, he told me.	Ko si iṣoro ti ara, o sọ fun mi.
So it was decided by many.	Nitorina o pinnu nipasẹ ọpọlọpọ.
He cut the book into pieces.	O ge iwe naa sinu apo.
They want to be convinced.	Wọn fẹ lati ni idaniloju.
Get home to show it.	Gba ile lati fi han.
He pulled away.	O fa kuro.
To be there for me.	Lati wa nibẹ fun mi.
Forget about it, he said.	Gbagbe nipa rẹ, o sọ.
That is all we can do.	Iyẹn jẹ gbogbo ohun ti a le ṣe.
That's what everyone is doing.	Ohun ti gbogbo eniyan n ṣe niyẹn.
Listen, we don’t have more time to lose on this.	Gbọ, a ko ni akoko diẹ sii lati padanu lori eyi.
This group has not yet met.	Ẹgbẹ yii ko tii pade sibẹsibẹ.
He left.	O lọ kuro.
I think you will love it too.	Mo ro pe iwọ yoo fẹran rẹ paapaa.
They fear they are wrong.	Wọn bẹru pe wọn jẹ aṣiṣe.
Maybe, you have nothing to lose.	Boya, o ko ni nkankan lati padanu.
It ruined your whole life.	O ba gbogbo aye rẹ jẹ.
Gives the other team a chance to fly them.	Yoo fun ẹgbẹ miiran ni aye lati fo wọn.
However, there is agreement on two points.	Sibẹsibẹ, adehun wa lori awọn aaye meji.
No, it's too beautiful.	Rara, o lẹwa ju.
It changed.	O yi pada.
We have been here all our lives.	A ti wa nibi gbogbo aye wa.
They could not understand it.	Wọn ko le loye rẹ.
It was not long.	O je ki ko to gun.
Both methods at the same time.	Awọn ọna mejeeji ni akoko kanna.
Group and and they will.	Ẹgbẹ ati ati awọn ti wọn yoo.
They will take your money.	Wọn yoo gba owo rẹ.
I want to go downstairs and let them go.	Mo fẹ lati lọ si isalẹ ki o jẹ ki wọn lọ.
No one told me like you.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ fun mi iru bii iwọ.
They make us laugh, work people.	Wọn ṣe wa rẹrin, ṣiṣẹ awọn eniyan.
We can't have any work.	A ko le ni iṣẹ kankan.
Okay, we get it.	O dara, a gba.
We know nothing wrong with that decision.	A ko mọ aṣiṣe kankan ninu ipinnu yẹn.
They are not in my shoes.	Wọn ko si ni bata mi.
Our report states relevant facts.	Iroyin wa sọ awọn otitọ ti o yẹ.
We cut nicely.	A ge dara julọ.
Tell her about your daughter.	Sọ fun u nipa ọmọbirin rẹ.
Her clothes were torn, and she did not wear shoes.	Aṣọ rẹ ti ya, ko si wọ bata.
Cats and dogs, and people, have come.	Awọn ologbo ati awọn aja, ati awọn eniyan, ti wa.
I love to wear.	Mo nifẹ lati wọ.
He said the same thing.	Ohun kanna ni o sọ.
Much is clear to me.	Elo ni ko o si mi.
He called my name more often.	O pe orukọ mi ni igba diẹ sii.
We just don’t have the time and energy.	A o kan ko ni akoko ati agbara.
But he was wrong.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe aṣiṣe.
You don't even have to talk to him.	O ko paapaa ni lati ba a sọrọ.
I don’t mean to be.	Emi ko tumọ lati jẹ.
This is the day of my first classes of the year.	Eyi ni ọjọ ti awọn kilasi akọkọ mi ti ọdun.
He came across the room.	O wa kọja yara naa.
If you refuse, you should not delete it.	Ti o ba kọ, ko yẹ ki o pa a.
My mother tells me not to go out.	Iya mi n sọ fun mi pe ki n ma jade.
To the woman you love.	Si obinrin ti o feran.
Maybe they know something.	Boya wọn mọ nkankan.
It took him a while to pick it up.	O si mu u a akoko lati gbe o.
She was hesitant to move on.	O ṣiyemeji lati gbe mọ.
I have a problem with it.	Mo ti ni ọrọ kan pẹlu rẹ.
I asked a lot about how to find a job.	Mo beere pupọ nipa bi o ṣe le wa iṣẹ kan.
For some children, it may be too late.	Fun diẹ ninu awọn ọmọde, o le ti pẹ ju.
, as you wish.	, bi o ṣe fẹ.
He went on there.	O si lọ lori nibẹ.
Either way, he understands.	Ni ọna kan, o ni oye.
This is a job you do for yourself.	Eyi ni iṣẹ ti o ṣe fun ara rẹ.
We have it, and we are here.	A ni o, ati awọn ti a wa nibi.
Our food is not more than a week.	Ounjẹ wa kii ṣe diẹ sii ju ọsẹ kan lọ.
But it was not good enough.	Sugbon o je ko dara to.
Maybe, something is wrong with me.	Boya, nkankan ti ko tọ si pẹlu mi.
Everyone loves it.	Gbogbo eniyan feran rẹ.
My father will be angry.	Baba mi yoo binu.
You will feel the doors.	Iwọ yoo lero awọn ilẹkun.
There was no time to lose, the man said.	Ko si akoko lati padanu, ọkunrin naa sọ.
After a year they again misinterpreted my information.	Lẹhin ọdun kan wọn tun ni alaye mi ni aṣiṣe.
Those people are also hard to help.	Awọn eniyan yẹn tun nira lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
It has been a difficult time for us there.	O ti jẹ akoko ti o nira fun wa nibẹ.
So when did you do it.	Nitorina nigbawo ni o ṣe.
Many decisions were made for us.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ipinnu ni a ṣe fun wa.
None of it was planned that way.	Ko si ọkan ninu rẹ ti a gbero ni ọna yẹn.
Well, better than nothing.	O dara, o dara ju ohunkohun lọ.
You are here.	O wa nibi.
I’m not sure what’s going on in your head.	Emi ko ni idaniloju ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ ni ori rẹ.
Your information is not very good.	Alaye rẹ ko pe ni dara julọ.
I have to use your book.	Mo ni lati lo iwe rẹ.
Drink, from your bed.	Mu, lati ibusun rẹ.
The train left before we arrived.	Ọkọ oju irin naa lọ ki a to de.
Too much to ask.	Pupọ pupọ lati beere.
Go ahead, do this on your own.	Tẹsiwaju, ṣe eyi ni tirẹ.
Tell me you love me.	Sọ fun mi pe o nifẹ mi.
Two did not.	Meji ko ṣe.
If we wait for it, we will not have it in the future.	Ti a ba duro fun, a ko ni ni ojo iwaju.
He borrowed it for her.	O ya a fun u.
Both have self-confidence in many ways.	Awọn mejeeji ni idaniloju ara wọn ni ọna pupọ.
We do not know what to think.	A ko mọ kini lati ronu.
They are a woman and a man.	Wọn jẹ obinrin ati ọkunrin kan.
Okay, that won’t happen to us.	O dara, iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ si wa.
Sometimes it is also understandable.	Nigba miiran o tun jẹ oye.
I don’t have anyone to play with today.	Emi ko ni ẹnikan lati mu ṣiṣẹ pẹlu loni.
If you do, you will not be friends for too long.	Ti o ba ṣe, iwọ kii yoo ni ọrẹ fun pipẹ pupọ.
The high man said nothing.	Eniyan ti o ga ko sọ ohunkohun.
It was incredibly hard.	O jẹ iyalẹnu lile.
I am not finished.	Emi ko ti pari.
Now, a friend.	Bayi, ọrẹ kan.
But it's still coming.	Sugbon o tun n bọ.
It will start soon.	Yoo bẹrẹ laipẹ.
Someone must have told you.	Ẹnikan gbọdọ ti sọ fun ọ.
I am looking for a program.	Mo n wa eto kan.
Whatever you think works.	Ohunkohun ti o ro ṣiṣẹ.
But never use one to end your life.	Ṣugbọn ko lo ọkan lati pari aye rẹ.
He decided to clean the roads.	O pinnu lati nu awọn ọna opopona.
However much remains the same.	Sibẹsibẹ pupọ wa kanna.
I consider myself a group of people.	Mo ka ara mi si ẹgbẹ awọn eniyan yẹn.
We need more information on the concepts.	A nilo awọn alaye diẹ sii lori awọn ero.
Let's see what this means.	Jẹ ki a wo kini eyi tumọ si.
We need a new space.	A nilo aaye tuntun kan.
Neither man was happy with the decision.	Bẹni ọkunrin ko dun pẹlu ipinnu naa.
he thought.	o ro.
It was.	Oun ni.
Summer came out to keep my house.	Ooru wa jade lati tọju ile mi.
There's a lot going on while.	Nibẹ ni a pupo ti lọ lori nigba ti.
The children sleep well.	Awọn ọmọde sun oorun daradara.
Anything you do can’t bring your sister back.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣe ko le mu arabinrin rẹ pada.
And other little things like that.	Ati awọn nkan kekere miiran bi iyẹn.
These last few weeks have been very difficult for me.	Awọn ọsẹ diẹ sẹhin wọnyi ti nira pupọ fun mi.
You can leave.	O ti le kuro.
Small groups began to move around together.	Awọn ẹgbẹ kekere bẹrẹ lati gbe ni ayika papọ.
Your life seems like a long one.	Igbesi aye rẹ dabi igba pipẹ.
Please do not add an image.	Jọwọ ma ṣe fi aworan kun.
It was his last day.	O jẹ ọjọ ikẹhin rẹ.
Surely our cities will be better off.	O daju pe awọn ilu wa yoo dara julọ.
I know some people paint in anything.	Mo mọ diẹ ninu awọn eniyan kan kun ni ohunkohun.
Stand your ground now.	Duro ti ara rẹ ni bayi.
Men are men.	Awọn ọkunrin jẹ ọkunrin.
Can be used as an office.	Le ṣee lo bi ọfiisi.
How did you miss it.	Bawo ni o ṣe padanu rẹ.
Until next week, enjoy them !.	Titi di ọsẹ ti n bọ, gbadun wọn!.
You can always be better.	O le nigbagbogbo dara julọ.
This was my last chance.	Eleyi je mi kẹhin anfani.
I know what my brother did.	Mo mọ ohun ti arakunrin mi ṣe.
Given to students.	Ti fi fun awọn ọmọ ile-iwe.
It’s for me, he thought.	O jẹ fun mi, o ro.
But tell me this.	Ṣugbọn sọ eyi fun mi.
I just wanted a look into the back room.	Mo ti o kan fe kan wo sinu awọn pada yara.
We do not expect much from them.	A ko nireti pupọ ninu wọn.
Lack of.	Ko ni.
He will think.	Oun yoo ronu.
It is, and still is, a very good boat.	O jẹ, ati pe o tun wa, ọkọ oju omi ti o dara pupọ.
He will be here tomorrow.	Oun yoo wa nibi ni ọla.
I just don’t know how to get there.	Mo kan ko mọ ọna wo ni lati gba.
Here it is not the same as the test.	Nibi kii ṣe kanna bi idanwo.
You enjoyed them.	O gbadun wọn.
He does not want it.	Ko fe e.
It tired me.	O rẹ mi.
It’s how you drink.	O jẹ bi o ṣe mu.
For my children, for anyone.	Fun awọn ọmọ mi, fun ẹnikẹni.
This is especially true when they live in large groups.	Eyi jẹ otitọ paapaa nigbati wọn ba n gbe ni awọn ẹgbẹ nla.
Women really like it.	Awọn obinrin fẹran rẹ gaan.
Enjoy the moment.	Gbadun akoko naa.
Now let's jump back to the course.	Bayi jẹ ki ká fo pada si awọn dajudaju.
You should go if you can.	O yẹ ki o lọ ti o ba le.
They can break your old.	Wọn le fọ ti atijọ rẹ.
They soon concluded, however, that something was wrong.	Laipẹ wọn pari, sibẹsibẹ, pe ohun kan ko tọ.
But we also have to figure out how.	Ṣugbọn a tun ni lati ro ero bawo ni.
He would not let me go.	Ko jẹ ki n lọ.
He will have a good one.	Oun yoo ni ọkan ti o dara.
Good to laugh.	O dara lati rẹrin.
This turned out to be true.	Eyi yipada lati jẹ otitọ.
So he said a lot.	Nitorina o sọ pupọ.
Nothing will ever change that.	Ko si ohun ti yoo lailai yi ti o.
He decided to take over the world.	O pinnu lati gba aye.
Put my hand on your hair.	Ran ọwọ mi lori irun rẹ.
It would have been obvious that there was no space there.	Yoo ti han gbangba pe ko si aaye nibẹ.
He began to speak.	O bẹrẹ si sọrọ.
This hit home.	Eleyi lu ile.
You will burn your whole life.	Iwọ yoo sun gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ kuro.
Give that a way to pull away.	Fun iyẹn ni ọna lati fa kuro.
That night.	Ni alẹ yẹn.
Think about deadlines.	Ronu nipa awọn akoko ipari.
There may be electricity in the device.	Ina le wa ninu ẹrọ naa.
I will live, of course.	Emi yoo gbe, dajudaju.
But we probably already know that.	Ṣugbọn o ṣee ṣe pe a ti mọ iyẹn paapaa.
I called you and said that the book you want has arrived.	Mo pe e mo si so pe iwe ti o fe ti de.
There is not very much we can do.	Nibẹ ni ko gan Elo a le se.
That may not be my reality.	Eyi ko le jẹ otitọ mi.
No one knows what happened.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
No one ate.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o jẹun.
He looks from side to side.	O n wo lati ẹgbẹ si ẹgbẹ.
He was the first thing he saw.	Oun ni ohun akọkọ ti o rii.
It is small and tastes small.	O jẹ kekere ati ki o dun kekere.
Because it is about me.	Nitori o jẹ nipa mi.
Tabi mu u.	Tabi mu u.
As soon as he saw her face, he surprised her with a question.	Ni kete ti o ti ri oju rẹ, o ya u pẹlu ibeere kan.
One of the best decisions ever.	Ọkan ninu awọn ipinnu ti o dara julọ lailai.
You will live here now.	O yoo gbe nibi bayi.
Dad makes it easy.	Baba jẹ ki o rọrun.
The game is great.	Awọn ere jẹ nla.
Not personal, but local.	Kii ṣe awọn ti ara ẹni, ṣugbọn awọn agbegbe.
There is nothing personal in any of them.	Ko si ohun ti ara ẹni ni eyikeyi ninu wọn.
Maybe years later.	Boya ọdun lẹhin.
They also hope for it.	Wọn tun nireti rẹ.
They need something from you.	Wọn nilo nkankan lati ọdọ rẹ.
It was intended to surprise me.	O ti pinnu lati ṣe iyanu fun mi.
Anyone else think this is a bad idea ?.	Ẹnikẹni miiran ro pe eyi jẹ ero buburu?.
I just know the name.	Mo kan mọ orukọ naa.
What help do you think?	Kini iranlọwọ ṣe o ro?
You never forget it.	O ko gbagbe o.
There are the wrong people in it.	O wa awọn eniyan ti ko tọ ninu.
Three people entered this room.	Eniyan mẹta wọ yara yii.
These systems can work on your local machine.	Awọn ọna ṣiṣe wọnyi le ṣiṣẹ lori ẹrọ agbegbe rẹ.
My hair just stood on end.	Irun mi kan dide ni ipari.
I like it very much.	Mo feran re pupo.
Word can stand.	Ọrọ le duro.
I am a mother and art teacher.	Mo jẹ iya ati olukọ iṣẹ ọna.
Not a whole lot to say about it.	Ko kan gbogbo pupo lati sọ nipa o.
It can be hard to find.	O le nira lati wa.
We're going the other way.	A n jade lọ ọna miiran.
It is yours.	O jẹ tirẹ.
When he died.	Nigbati o ku.
We are living together.	A n wa laaye papọ.
Do not pull.	Maṣe fa.
We do not know what will happen.	A ko mọ ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
And so simple.	Ati bẹ rọrun.
Go work with this.	Lọ ṣiṣe pẹlu eyi.
I am a special man in this city.	Mo jẹ ọkunrin pataki ni ilu yii.
Many people my age have died.	Pupọ eniyan ti ọjọ ori mi ti ku.
Our hands or not.	Ọwọ wa tabi rara.
It’s not something like that, it doesn’t.	Kii ṣe nkan bii iyẹn, ko ṣe bẹ.
It has grown.	O ti dagba.
But they have a simple.	Sugbon won ni kan ti o rọrun.
It was a program that worked well for both of us.	O jẹ eto ti o ṣiṣẹ daradara fun wa mejeeji.
They are not the only children anymore.	Wọn kii ṣe ọmọ nikan mọ.
Her hair is even longer.	Irun rẹ jẹ paapaa gun.
Look around.	Wo daradara ni ayika.
He is planning something.	O n gbero nkan kan.
That was making my head spin a few hours ago.	Eyi ti n ṣe ori mi ni awọn wakati diẹ sẹhin.
Just wait is.	O kan duro jẹ.
I need them to listen.	Mo nilo wọn lati fẹ gbọ.
The only surprise is that it takes longer.	Iyanu nikan ni pe o gba to gun.
It’s good to have something right.	O dara lati ni nkan ti o tọ.
I can think of many things to do with it.	Mo le ronu nipa ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
This is not our opinion.	Eyi kii ṣe ero wa.
Learn to say no.	Kọ ẹkọ lati sọ rara.
It's very hot, really.	O gbona pupọ, ni otitọ.
The decision was hastened by.	Ipinnu naa ti yara nipasẹ.
It was a special place.	O je kan pataki ibi.
Just in case you can break the account.	Ti o ba kan pe o le fọ iroyin naa.
The program performed well.	Eto naa ṣe daradara.
You must fear him.	O gbọdọ bẹru rẹ.
Here is his advice.	Eyi ni imọran rẹ.
That's hot.	Iyẹn gbona.
There is no place to hide.	Ko si aaye lati tọju.
Don't say that now.	Maṣe sọ iyẹn ni bayi.
I think he was there.	Mo ro pe o wa nibẹ.
Until the door.	Titi ilẹkun.
It doesn't look like beautiful.	O ko ni wo bi lẹwa.
Now, it seems to me that you don’t even play these games.	Bayi, o han si mi pe iwọ ko paapaa ṣe awọn ere wọnyi.
He is in their family.	O wa ninu idile wọn.
I have two other things for you.	Mo ni ohun meji miiran fun ọ.
Let's try again.	Jẹ ká gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
I was worried about the weather.	Mo ṣe aniyan nipa oju ojo.
But it may be worth it.	Ṣugbọn o le jẹ tọ.
I will not let them have.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki wọn ni.
I said something to him, but it was not true.	Mo ti sọ ohun kan fun u, ṣugbọn kii ṣe otitọ.
We think you should.	A ro pe o yẹ.
Children walk around the play area.	Awọn ọmọde rin ni ayika agbegbe ere.
This changes from person to person.	Eyi yipada lati eniyan si eniyan.
The work is like nothing we have ever seen before.	Iṣẹ naa dabi ohunkohun ti a ko tii ri tẹlẹ.
I don't really want to know.	Emi ko fẹ lati mọ gaan.
I would plan to do it tonight.	Emi yoo gbero lati ṣe ni alẹ oni.
Call me if anything happens.	Pe mi ti ohunkohun ba ṣẹlẹ.
They will have to build another power station.	Wọn yoo ni lati kọ ibudo agbara miiran.
He was sure he would never walk again.	O ni idaniloju pe oun ko ni rin mọ.
Even the bad ones.	Paapaa awọn buburu.
All this is well known.	Gbogbo eyi ni a mọ daradara.
Put it where you only need it, rather than just advice.	Fi si ibi ti o nilo nikan, ju bi imọran nikan.
We don’t like ideas that build on other ideas.	A ko fẹ awọn ero ti o kọ lori awọn ero miiran.
Call me if there is any news.	Pe mi ti iroyin kan ba wa.
Do not touch!	Maṣe fi ọwọ kan!
He was very young.	O jẹ ọmọde pupọ.
That worked.	Ti ṣiṣẹ yẹn.
The driver dropped it.	Awakọ naa kọ ọ silẹ.
They may have already heard it all.	O ṣee ṣe ki wọn ti gbọ gbogbo rẹ tẹlẹ.
I am.	Emi ni mi.
Fire is nothing new.	Ina kii ṣe nkan tuntun.
No one was in sight.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa ni oju.
And he was not the only one who wanted it.	Ati pe kii ṣe oun nikan ni o fẹ.
When he spoke again his voice was the same.	Nigbati o tun sọrọ lẹẹkansi ohun rẹ jẹ kanna.
Because of temptation.	Nitori idanwo.
He wore a suit to work.	O wọ aṣọ kan lati ṣiṣẹ.
This book would not have been written without you.	Iwe yi ko ba ti kọ laisi iwọ.
Why.	Idi ti awọn.
He has kept it, from that day until tonight.	O ti pa a mọ, lati ọjọ yẹn titi di alẹ yii.
I can't wait anymore.	Emi ko le duro mọ.
This is enough.	Eleyi je to.
So they try to get it.	Nitorina wọn gbiyanju lati gba.
And they are the same.	Ati pe wọn jẹ kanna.
We need that.	A nilo iyẹn.
They sit together to wait for your lunch.	Wọn joko papọ lati duro fun ounjẹ ọsan rẹ.
Listen as he speaks.	Gbọ bi o ṣe n sọrọ.
You will be back for more.	Iwọ yoo pada wa fun diẹ sii.
He spoke more to any of them.	O sọrọ diẹ si eyikeyi ninu wọn.
Don’t want to be noticed.	Maṣe fẹ lati ṣe akiyesi.
I will keep my word.	Emi o pa ọrọ mi mọ.
Please show me the way to the station.	Jọwọ fi ọna han mi si ibudo naa.
You know what that means.	O mọ kini iyẹn tumọ si.
They just come and go.	Wọn kan wa ati lọ.
He seems to have no self-confidence.	O dabi ẹni pe ko ni idaniloju ti ara rẹ.
The new castle is never finished.	Ile nla tuntun ko pari rara.
So we celebrated for ourselves.	Nitorina a ṣe ayẹyẹ fun ara wa.
You must remember your name.	O gbọdọ ranti orukọ rẹ.
Maybe something has happened in your life.	Boya ohun kan ti ṣẹlẹ lori aye rẹ.
Can't remember your name right now.	Ko le ranti orukọ rẹ ni bayi.
Nothing ever went as expected.	Ko si ohun lailai lọ bi o ti ṣe yẹ.
It may seem impossible today, but maybe one day.	O le dabi pe ko ṣee ṣe loni, ṣugbọn boya ni ọjọ kan.
The materials are outdated, broken, run down.	Awọn ohun elo jẹ igba atijọ, fọ, ṣiṣe silẹ.
I feel you.	Mo rilara rẹ.
This service cannot be allowed to continue.	Iṣẹ yii ko le gba laaye lati tẹsiwaju.
They have something else to worry about.	Wọn ti ni nkan miiran lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
The fire killed itself.	Ina pa ara rẹ.
These people want to talk to me.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi fẹ lati ba mi sọrọ.
He reached the table to get his hands on it.	O de ori tabili lati gba ọwọ rẹ.
They have continued to walk this path.	Wọn ti tẹsiwaju lati rin ọna yii.
But you can have a lot more.	Ṣugbọn o le ni pupọ diẹ sii.
Life does not happen that way.	Igbesi aye ko ṣẹlẹ ni ọna yẹn.
All materials are used as received.	Gbogbo awọn ohun elo ni a lo bi o ti gba.
You like it.	O fẹran rẹ.
You just haven't seen them yet.	O kan ko tii ri wọn sibẹsibẹ.
All this can be yours.	Gbogbo eyi le jẹ tirẹ.
The box is broken.	Apoti ti fọ.
They have no plans.	Wọn ko ni eto.
My system was clean.	Mi eto je mọ.
I was in love with her.	Mo ti wà ni ife pẹlu rẹ.
His friends did not agree.	Awọn ọrẹ rẹ ko gba.
You do not want this.	Iwọ ko fẹ eyi.
We have made a decision and we have not changed.	A ti ṣe ipinnu ati pe a ko yipada.
What is the cause.	Kini o fa.
Well done with it.	O dara daradara pẹlu rẹ.
Also does not work.	Tun ko ṣiṣẹ.
She loved it.	O ti fẹ rẹ.
He is also there.	O tun wa nibẹ.
I have a question.	Mo ni ibeere kan.
He was here yesterday.	O wa nibi lana.
This service seems to have been well received.	Iṣẹ yii dabi pe o ti gba daradara.
Of course he would love it.	Dajudaju oun yoo nifẹ rẹ.
He had live music at night to boot.	O ni orin laaye ni alẹ lati bata.
In that you are.	Ninu iyẹn iwọ jẹ.
They consider their surroundings well.	Wọn ṣe akiyesi agbegbe wọn daradara.
Take this.	Mu eyi.
It is always hot.	Nigbagbogbo o gbona.
I saw someone leave behind.	Mo rii ẹnikan ti o lọ kuro ni ẹhin.
However, it is better no value.	Sibẹsibẹ, o dara ju ko si iye.
I wish you had talked more.	Mo fẹ pe o ti sọrọ nipa diẹ sii.
But someone was there.	Ṣugbọn ẹnikan wa nibẹ.
You like it.	O feran re.
You know how to get the best out of me.	O mọ bi o ṣe le gba ohun ti o dara julọ ninu mi.
Just tell the truth.	O kan sọ otitọ.
Please let me know if this is okay with you.	Jọwọ jẹ ki mi mọ ti eyi ba dara pẹlu rẹ.
The days draw on.	Awọn ọjọ fa lori.
They will let them see it.	Wọn yoo jẹ ki wọn wo o.
I'm not doing very well today.	Emi ko ṣe daradara pupọ loni.
But they will not be there.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii yoo wa nibẹ.
He sat there.	O joko nibẹ.
You don’t want them anymore.	O ko fẹ wọn tun.
Do the wrong thing.	Ṣe awọn nkan ti ko tọ.
However, it is probably not possible.	Bi o ti jẹ pe, o ṣee ṣe ko ṣee ṣe.
I believe this is one of the first.	Mo gbagbọ pe eyi jẹ ọkan ninu awọn akọkọ.
But it is the same way.	Ṣugbọn o ti wa ni ọna kanna.
At this point, a reason test is understandable.	Ni aaye yii, idanwo idi kan jẹ oye.
It should have been removed.	O yẹ ki a ti pa a kuro.
But everyone knows only personal history.	Ṣugbọn gbogbo eniyan lo mọ itan ti ara ẹni nikan.
It was a great art.	O je kan nla aworan.
And his life.	Ati igbesi aye rẹ.
Are you sure you want to do that?	Ṣe o da ọ loju pe o fẹ ṣe iyẹn?
The heat is on.	Ooru naa n di.
We spent many hours talking.	A lo ọpọlọpọ awọn wakati sọrọ.
The picture looks old.	Aworan naa dabi ti atijọ.
Now we are brought.	Bayi a ti mu wa.
Or make a donation here.	Tabi ṣe ẹbun nibi.
Nothing is possible to change my mind on it.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣee ṣe lati yi ọkan mi pada lori rẹ.
It should grow.	O yẹ ki o dagba.
Know who is inside.	Mọ ẹni ti o wa ninu.
Too much for a man.	Pupọ pupọ fun ọkunrin kan.
She wants another but think better of it.	O fe miiran sugbon ro dara ti o.
His mother took him first.	Iya rẹ mu u akọkọ.
I started getting hard.	Mo bẹrẹ si ni lile.
After the game they talked for a while.	Lẹhin ere naa wọn sọrọ fun igba diẹ.
They know when they are doing things and why.	Wọn mọ nigbati wọn n ṣe awọn nkan ati idi.
They did not go together.	Wọn ko lọ papọ.
I have been thinking about this.	Mo ti ronu nipa eyi.
Only women are known.	Obinrin nikan ni a mọ.
Let me try to finish this.	Jẹ ki n gbiyanju lati pari eyi.
We know what it is.	A mọ ohun ti o jẹ.
Born tomorrow.	Bi si ọla.
We just enjoyed.	A o kan gbadun.
He did not waste any time, he did not say a word.	Ko padanu akoko kankan, ko sọ ọrọ kankan.
There is no such thing.	Ko si iru nkan bẹẹ.
They notice each other for a long time.	Wọn ṣe akiyesi ara wọn fun igba pipẹ.
Let us hope so.	Jẹ ki a nireti bẹ.
But let me finish the book.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki n pari iwe naa.
Look at the two people.	Wo eniyan meji naa.
So let’s do this.	Nitorina jẹ ki a ṣe eyi.
No one can know about it.	Ko si ẹniti o le mọ nipa rẹ.
It will not be for a few days.	Kii yoo jẹ fun awọn ọjọ diẹ.
The place will make money as a holiday home.	Ibi naa yoo ṣe owo bi ile isinmi.
That's very good.	Iyẹn dara pupọ.
So he did.	Nitorina o ṣe.
You have already called it.	O ti pe e tẹlẹ.
My life is over.	Aye mi ti pari.
I'll call you.	Emi yoo pe e.
A little more than a lot.	Diẹ ninu diẹ sii ju pupọ lọ.
I told myself that things are not what they are.	Mo sọ fun ara mi pe awọn nkan kii ṣe ohun ti wọn jẹ.
In the same room even.	Ni yara kanna paapaa.
Do you find yourself here.	Ṣe o ri ara rẹ nibi.
You are wrong.	O ṣe aṣiṣe.
The garden is very nice, we have great pictures there.	Ọgba naa dara pupọ, a ni awọn aworan nla nibẹ.
And we are tired.	Ati pe a ti rẹ wa.
In the end, one of them did not.	Ni ipari, ọkan ninu wọn ko ṣe.
That's enough.	O ti to.
He did not think of being alone in the big bed.	O ko ronu lati wa nikan ni ibusun nla naa.
Nothing good can be found in it.	Ko si ohun ti o dara le wa ninu rẹ.
I closed the restaurant.	Mo ti pa ile ounjẹ naa.
The cat and its dog walk around the garden.	Ologbo ati aja re rin ni ayika ọgba.
It looks good, too.	O n wo daradara, paapaa.
Don’t always say it’s not good enough.	Maṣe sọ nigbagbogbo pe o ko dara to.
He has also gone to counsel.	O tun ti lọ si imọran.
And it has been for a very long time.	Ati pe o ti wa fun igba pipẹ pupọ.
It depends on the situation.	O da lori ipo naa.
Take it to him.	Gbe e lọ si ọdọ rẹ.
Time for me to eat lunch, especially.	Akoko fun mi lati jẹ ounjẹ ọsan, paapaa.
He will not do anything.	Oun kii yoo ṣe ohunkohun.
This is a question of both law and reality.	Eyi jẹ ibeere ti ofin mejeeji ati otitọ.
It was one of my favorite things to do.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ohun ayanfẹ mi lati ṣe.
It’s hard of a company.	O jẹ lile ti ile-iṣẹ kan.
That's very sweet.	Iyẹn dun pupọ.
Very little to understand.	O kere pupọ lati ni oye.
I love the book.	Mo nifẹ iwe naa.
You should contact a doctor as soon as possible	O yẹ ki o kan si dokita ni kete bi o ti ṣee
She was a friend who took care of my son sometimes.	O jẹ ọrẹ kan ti o tọju ọmọ mi nigba miiran.
It is the love of my life.	O jẹ ifẹ ti igbesi aye mi.
And we think he stays with us the same way.	Ati pe a ro pe o duro pẹlu wa ni ọna kanna.
He told us himself.	O sọ fun wa funrararẹ.
Note that and.	Ṣe akiyesi pe ati.
He did that himself, no one told him.	O ṣe iyẹn funrararẹ, ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ fun u.
It looks like this.	O dabi eleyi.
I tried to walk past them.	Mo gbiyanju lati rin kọja wọn.
A car was left on the road.	A fi ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan silẹ ni opopona.
It takes some time to recover.	O gba akoko diẹ lati pada.
Don't miss your gift!	Maṣe padanu ẹbun rẹ!
I would like to wear this much.	Emi yoo fẹ lati wọ eyi pupọ.
I would be very happy if you would.	Inu mi yoo dun pupọ ti o ba fẹ.
Just hope you agree with your idea.	O kan nireti pe o gba pẹlu ero rẹ.
I refuse, he pulls.	Mo kọ, o fa.
I just don’t agree with it.	Mo kan ko gba pẹlu rẹ.
Of course your home is yours.	Dajudaju ile rẹ jẹ tirẹ.
Job applications will be up and running next month.	Awọn ohun elo iṣẹ yoo wa ni oke ati ṣiṣe ni oṣu ti n bọ.
My understanding is good.	Oye mi dara.
Maybe we will have a future.	Boya a yoo ni ojo iwaju.
Her friend entered the room.	Ọrẹ rẹ wọ yara naa.
I love your wife the most.	Mo feran iyawo re dara ju.
This was too much for me.	Eleyi je pupo ju fun mi.
Even the way he treated me has changed.	Paapaa ọna ti o mu mi ti yipada.
We have to be on it.	A ni lati wa lori rẹ.
For me, my love.	Fun mi, ifẹ mi.
It can't be anything, that's what they're saying.	Ko le jẹ nkankan, ohun ti wọn n sọ niyẹn.
But the issue is money.	Ṣugbọn ọrọ naa wa ni owo.
Let us know how that works for you.	Jẹ ki a mọ bi iyẹn ṣe ṣiṣẹ fun ọ.
Love your life and love yourself.	Nifẹ igbesi aye rẹ ki o fẹran ara rẹ.
He seemed to be talking to someone.	O dabi ẹni pe o n ba ẹnikan sọrọ.
Read all this.	Ka gbogbo nkan yii.
You should be with him now.	O yẹ ki o wa pẹlu rẹ ni bayi.
I want to see you up and about.	Mo fẹ lati ri ọ soke ati nipa.
I can’t do that to them.	Emi ko le ṣe bẹ si wọn.
History will repeat itself.	Itan yoo tun funrararẹ.
Now it is for him.	Bayi o wa fun u.
This does not work.	Eyi ko ṣiṣẹ.
That’s what you see.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti o rii.
We think, of course, that we should.	A ro pe, dajudaju, pe a yẹ.
I think everything was so much fun.	Mo ro pe ohun gbogbo je ki Elo fun.
I didn’t think to ask him if he wanted to come.	Emi ko ronu lati beere lọwọ rẹ boya o fẹ lati wa.
We are afraid to lose ourselves even when we know we must.	A bẹru lati padanu ara wa paapaa nigba ti a mọ pe a gbọdọ.
We write with love.	A kọ pẹlu ifẹ.
These devices use electricity to operate.	Awọn ẹrọ wọnyi lo ina lati ṣiṣẹ.
He could not think of anything to say.	Ko le ronu ohunkohun lati sọ.
We can't be late for school.	A ko le pẹ fun ile-iwe.
I would like to say something here.	Emi yoo fẹ lati sọ nkankan nibi.
For detailed information, see.	Fun alaye alaye, wo.
A little surprise came at all.	Iyanu kekere ni o de rara.
Can't wait for that to be around.	Ko le duro fun iyẹn lati wa ni ayika.
And it’s not my marriage.	Ati pe kii ṣe igbeyawo mi.
Most will go through the water.	Pupọ julọ yoo lọ nipasẹ omi.
He does not know what.	Ko mọ kini.
A test will of course let you know.	Idanwo kan yoo dajudaju jẹ ki o mọ.
I really want to go with it.	Mo gan fẹ lati lọ pẹlu rẹ.
Essentially it is a dual work class.	Ni pataki o jẹ kilasi iṣẹ meji.
Just say it could happen again.	O kan sọ pe o le ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
An advantage, perhaps.	Anfani kan, boya.
I am the only one.	Emi nikan ni.
You can try this and see if it is not for you.	O le gbiyanju eyi ki o rii pe kii ṣe fun ọ.
It came from above.	O wa lati oke.
Two were killed.	Meji ni won pa.
He hopes it will.	O nireti pe yoo.
Add to them.	Fi si wọn.
Anyone can do this.	Ẹnikẹni le ṣe eyi.
We do a lot of things together.	A ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan papọ.
These things are on fire.	Awọn nkan wọnyi wa ni ina.
We will start testing next week.	A yoo bẹrẹ idanwo ni ọsẹ to nbọ.
Maybe you better keep me away.	Boya o dara ki o pa mi mọ kuro.
You notice that.	O ṣe akiyesi iyẹn.
The world is big and yet so small.	Aye jẹ nla ati sibẹsibẹ ki o kere.
Change the world.	Yi aye pada.
Now you need something to put water in.	Bayi o nilo nkankan lati fi omi sinu.
There are two problems with that story.	Awọn iṣoro meji wa pẹlu itan yẹn.
What the books do not say.	Ohun ti awọn iwe ko sọ.
This will be difficult.	Kii yoo nira.
Not a big room.	Kii ṣe yara nla kan.
They will expect this from me.	Wọn yoo reti eyi lọwọ mi.
They say we need help.	Wọn sọ pe a nilo iranlọwọ.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ko si ohun ti ko tọ.
It has turned away.	O ti yipada kuro.
Okay, just the last one on this one.	O dara, o kan kẹhin lori eyi.
He looked at people nearby	O wo eniyan nitosi
Without it, you would not be able to drive your car.	Laisi rẹ, iwọ kii yoo ni anfani lati wakọ ọkọ rẹ.
We are also open at all major holidays.	A tun ṣii ni gbogbo awọn isinmi pataki.
Your mouth is not in the right place.	Ẹnu rẹ ko si ni ibiti o yẹ ki o wa.
Your word is everything.	Ọrọ rẹ ni ohun gbogbo.
But there is so much more to visit and learn about.	Ṣugbọn o wa pupọ diẹ sii lati ṣabẹwo ati kọ ẹkọ nipa.
Or if you are worried about something.	Tabi ti o ba ni aniyan nipa nkan kan.
Who are you?	Ta ni o.
But it is important to have a problem with it.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe pataki lati ni iṣoro pẹlu rẹ.
It can be used in many ways.	O le ṣee lo ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna.
Remember to call a doctor.	Ranti lati pe dokita.
Not much, that’s for sure.	Kii ṣe pupọ, iyẹn daju.
There is no room for anything else.	Ko si aaye fun ohunkohun miiran.
He took me.	O mu mi.
But most of them continue to do so.	Ṣugbọn pupọ julọ wọn tẹsiwaju lati tẹsiwaju.
You are too old for this type of work.	O ti dagba ju fun iru iṣẹ yii.
I want to talk to him.	Mo fẹ lati ba a sọrọ.
Go and hold the door.	Lọ di ilẹkun naa mu.
I just need some rest.	Mo kan nilo isinmi diẹ.
We have to do the work.	A ni lati ṣe iṣẹ naa.
He has returned.	O si ti pada le.
They'll get used to it, and if they don't, hard.	Wọn yoo lo si rẹ, ati pe ti wọn ko ba ṣe, lile.
The city grew around the railway station.	Ilu naa dagba ni ayika ibudo ọkọ oju irin.
It was easy for him.	O rọrun fun u.
Stand tall with your mother.	Duro ga pẹlu iya rẹ.
However, not everyone is.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan ni.
I have now said.	Mo ti so bayi.
Some say it might help me.	Diẹ ninu awọn sọ pe o le ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi.
We just figured it out.	A kan ro o jade.
But that is not always easy.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko rọrun nigbagbogbo.
I do not know anymore.	Emi ko mọ mọ.
I'm sure there is more.	Mo da mi loju pe diẹ sii wa.
Both can go.	Awọn mejeeji le lọ.
After several minutes, he stopped.	Lẹhin awọn iṣẹju pupọ, o duro.
I remember that.	Mo ranti pe.
More women come to you than men.	Awọn obinrin diẹ sii wa si ọdọ rẹ ju awọn ọkunrin lọ.
But it is also for you to learn wisdom.	Ṣugbọn tun jẹ fun ọ lati kọ ọgbọn ọgbọn.
It has always been so.	O ti jẹ bẹ nigbagbogbo.
He’s calling and coming.	O n pe o si n bọ.
It was not good.	O je ko dara.
All tests were repeated at least three times.	Gbogbo awọn idanwo ni a tun ṣe ni o kere ju igba mẹta.
I feel bad for him.	Mo lero buburu fun u.
The stories told in this book are ancient.	Awọn itan ti a sọ ninu iwe yii jẹ atijọ.
But none of this helped.	Ṣugbọn ko si ọkan ninu eyi ti o ṣe iranlọwọ.
Let it stand long enough to walk.	Jẹ ki o duro pẹ to ki o le rin.
I have seen something like this before.	Mo ti rii iru nkan bayi tẹlẹ.
He could not have visited all the places.	Ko le ti ṣabẹwo si gbogbo awọn aaye.
You have to pull it out.	O ni lati fa jade ninu rẹ.
My name is not my name anymore.	Orukọ mi kii ṣe orukọ mi mọ.
Everyone started moving.	Gbogbo eniyan bẹrẹ si gbe.
However it does not matter.	Sibẹsibẹ ko ṣe pataki.
Just a letter of law.	O kan lẹta ti ofin.
They have their own.	Wọn ni ara wọn.
I hate them for a reason.	Mo korira wọn fun idi kan.
To find a car.	Lati wa ọkọ.
How much money do you have?	Elo owo ni o ni?
You are here by this week only.	O wa nibi nipasẹ ọsẹ yii nikan.
They keep you.	Wọn pa ọ mọ.
If we miss this deadline.	Ti a ba padanu akoko ipari yii.
If it is a minimum amount it will do so.	Ti o ba jẹ iye ti o kere julọ yoo ṣe bii bẹ.
But some people just can't get enough rest.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu awọn eniyan kan ko le gba isinmi.
Now it is on.	Bayi o wa lori rẹ.
Whether or not they can pull that off is another question completely.	Boya tabi rara wọn le fa iyẹn kuro ni ibeere miiran patapata.
They say more.	Wọn sọ diẹ.
You have everything to know.	O ni ohun gbogbo lati mọ.
Water splashes on the face.	Omi ta si oju.
How everything sounded.	Bawo ni ohun gbogbo ti dun.
But this should give you an idea of ​​what we are into.	Ṣugbọn eyi yẹ ki o fun ọ ni imọran nipa ohun ti a wa sinu.
I understand why you can't.	Mo loye idi ti o ko le.
Okay, let's do this.	O dara, jẹ ki a ṣe eyi.
It may take a few minutes.	O le gba to iṣẹju diẹ.
He took me to town.	O mu mi ni ilu.
But you can not kill me.	Sugbon o ko le pa mi.
She decided to sleep for an hour.	O pinnu lati sun fun wakati kan.
And we believe it does.	Ati pe a gbagbọ pe o tun ṣe.
Or make yourself kill yourself.	Tabi mu ki o pa ara rẹ.
Some kids don’t want to.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọde ko fẹ.
That was a few weeks ago.	Iyẹn jẹ ọsẹ diẹ sẹhin.
Decide what is important.	Pinnu kini o ṣe pataki.
And we don't understand other people very well either.	Ati pe a ko ni loye awọn eniyan miiran daradara paapaa.
So, it is a good thing as well as a bad thing.	Nitorina, o jẹ ohun ti o dara bi daradara bi ohun buburu.
I just love it.	Mo kan nifẹ rẹ.
He will pay for his mistakes.	Oun yoo san owo fun awọn aṣiṣe rẹ.
You should be at home.	O yẹ ki o wa ni ile.
Now she looks like a bride.	Bayi o dabi iyawo.
But that doesn’t matter much.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣe pataki diẹ.
But we have a lot of schools.	Ṣugbọn a ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ile-iwe.
He put his hand in his pocket.	O si fi ọwọ rẹ sinu awọn apo rẹ.
This is very important.	Eyi ṣe pataki pupọ.
You have to put the work into it.	O ni lati fi iṣẹ naa sinu.
I can't remember the rest of the story.	Nko le ranti itan to ku.
My life changed.	Igbesi aye mi yipada.
No one asked what people wanted.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o beere kini awọn eniyan fẹ.
Remember just how good it is.	Ranti o kan bi o ti dara.
My hands will be very happy.	Ọwọ mi yoo dun pupọ.
I am not always the one to raise my hand for help.	Emi kii ṣe ọkan nigbagbogbo lati gbe ọwọ mi soke fun iranlọwọ.
We wonder if they will leave.	A ṣe akiyesi boya wọn yoo lọ kuro.
They want to hear yours.	Wọn fẹ lati gbọ tirẹ.
This world will come again.	Aye yi yoo tun wa.
Fire only.	Ina nikan.
Both have great conditions.	Mejeeji ni awọn ipo nla.
Do not ask me how they do it.	Maṣe beere lọwọ mi bawo ni wọn ṣe ṣe.
At least it seemed like it.	Ni o kere o dabi enipe o.
He said he understood.	O sọ pe o loye.
However what we eat should not affect you.	Sibẹsibẹ ohun ti a jẹ ko yẹ ki o kan ọ.
Just like his father.	O kan dabi baba rẹ.
There are many birthday celebrations in the summer months.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ayẹyẹ ọjọ ibi ni awọn oṣu ooru.
He is coming for the test.	O n bọ fun idanwo.
He noticed years before he left not very close.	O ṣe akiyesi ọdun ṣaaju ki o lọ kuro ko wa nitosi pupọ.
Can't wait anymore.	Ko le duro mọ.
We will be able to do more harm.	A yoo ni anfani lati ṣe ipalara diẹ sii.
None of us knew ourselves.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa mọ ara wa.
He is here today.	O wa loni.
He stands in the way on football decisions.	O duro ni ọna lori awọn ipinnu bọọlu.
Okay, at least he won’t get that.	O dara, o kere ju ko ni gba iyẹn.
The company wants to build a high-rise building.	Ile-iṣẹ naa fẹ lati kọ ile giga giga kan.
This thing will take you on the right path.	Nkan yii yoo mu ọ lọ si ọna ti o tọ.
Don't delay.	Maṣe pẹ.
I have seen my mother take good care of her.	Mo ti ri iya mi ṣe akiyesi rẹ daradara.
At least you're trying to.	O kere ju o n gbiyanju lati.
Nothing we went to stop him.	Ko si ohun ti a lọ lati da u.
Don't think about it.	Maṣe ronu nipa rẹ.
He doesn’t like me to talk to you, you know.	Ko fẹran mi lati ba ọ sọrọ, o mọ.
Ko mu.	Ko mu.
That is to make you angry.	Iyẹn ni lati mu ọ binu.
He has a hand on what it looks like.	O ni ọwọ lori ohun ti o dabi.
As you said, that is not what it is.	Bi o ti sọ, iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti o jẹ.
I know how fast.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe yara to.
We are our stories.	A jẹ awọn itan wa.
We will get back to you as soon as we can.	A yoo pada wa si ọdọ rẹ ni kete bi a ti le.
Think about this for a minute.	Ronu nipa eyi fun iṣẹju kan.
It is not available to him at all.	Ko si wa fun u rara.
Think of power.	Ronu ti agbara.
I think he was hungry.	Mo ro pe ebi pa.
He said once.	O sọ nigba kan.
This wood is used to store clothes.	Igi yii ni a lo lati tọju aṣọ.
I do not doubt my love for him or her to me.	Emi ko ṣiyemeji ifẹ mi fun u tabi tirẹ si mi.
At the end of his career.	Ni ipari iṣẹ rẹ.
Almost all the companies in the area have won.	O fẹrẹ to gbogbo awọn ile-iṣẹ ni agbegbe naa ti gba.
But we know what we know.	Ṣugbọn a mọ ohun ti a mọ.
Ask him about his wrists.	Beere lọwọ rẹ nipa awọn ọwọ ọwọ rẹ.
You have to decide that for yourself.	O ni lati pinnu iyẹn fun ara rẹ.
I think this will be another best for him.	Mo ro pe eyi yoo jẹ miiran ti o dara ju fun u.
Now you know why.	Bayi o mọ idi.
His eyes knew me.	Oju Re ti mo mi.
I think we will both get what we need.	Mo ro pe a yoo mejeeji gba ohun ti a nilo.
Nothing is certain.	Ko si ohun ti o daju.
The suspects were not beaten.	Awọn fura a ko lu.
He began to feel better.	O bẹrẹ si ni imọran ti o dara julọ.
So many times.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ igba.
Your mouth is closed.	Ẹnu rẹ ti di.
We don't need to see it again.	A ko nilo lati ri lẹẹkansi.
It doesn't matter.	Ko ṣe pataki.
Do it your way.	Ṣe o ni ọna rẹ.
It was not so sure.	O je ko bẹ daju.
Where would you like to meet?	Nibo ni iwọ yoo fẹ lati pade?
I'm sorry for that.	Mo binu fun iyẹn.
It is going to be something.	O ti wa ni lilọ lati wa ni nkankan.
Water is needed to keep food growing.	A nilo omi lati jẹ ki ounjẹ dagba.
He was not afraid.	Ko bẹru.
Dress off.	Aṣọ ti o lọ kuro.
But you already know.	Ṣugbọn o ti mọ tẹlẹ.
And you want to stay for three hours.	Ati pe o fẹ lati duro fun wakati mẹta.
We will break the law.	A yoo ṣe adehun ti ofin.
He thinks they should take us in our word.	O ro pe wọn yẹ ki o gba wa ni ọrọ wa.
I'm going to sleep now, the girl thought.	Emi yoo lọ sun ni bayi, ọmọbirin naa ro.
Do it on.	Ṣe o lori.
She has a son now.	O ni ọmọkunrin kan bayi.
He doesn’t want anyone to stay here alone.	Ko fẹ ki ẹnikẹni duro nibi nikan.
But listen to this.	Ṣugbọn gbọ eyi.
Something you like is wrong about.	Nkankan ti o fẹ jẹ aṣiṣe nipa.
He never called.	Ko pe rara.
But it is not yet the whole story.	Sugbon o jẹ ko sibẹsibẹ gbogbo itan.
But it still can't be done.	Ṣugbọn ko tun le ṣe.
I am trying to get here.	Mo n gbiyanju lati de ibi.
One of us has to go.	Ọkan ninu wa ni lati lọ.
I think running is not just for me.	Mo ro pe ṣiṣe kii ṣe fun mi nikan.
So let them have.	Nitorina jẹ ki wọn ni.
They are no longer children.	Wọn kii ṣe ọmọ mọ.
He closed his eyes and thought.	O di oju rẹ ki o ronu.
Which was probably good.	Eyi ti o wà jasi dara.
You have to test him to be sure.	O ni lati ṣe idanwo fun u lati ni idaniloju.
But even so, they need more information.	Ṣugbọn paapaa bẹ, wọn nilo alaye diẹ sii.
He liked a lot of people.	O feran ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan.
The road is rainy.	Opopona yii ni ojo ti fo.
And frankly, this is true of you, too.	Ati ni otitọ, eyi jẹ otitọ ti rẹ, paapaa.
And they would even leave me alone.	Ati pe wọn yoo fi mi silẹ paapaa.
People believe what they want.	Awọn eniyan gbagbọ ohun ti wọn fẹ.
That is well known.	Iyẹn mọ daradara.
Not much out.	Ko jade pupọ.
He waited and waited for them to catch up.	O duro ati ki o duro fun wọn lati yẹ.
Change what you can change and get what you can't change.	Yi ohun ti o le pada ki o gba ohun ti ko le yipada.
The only thing that continues to hold on in time.	Awọn nikan ohun ti o tẹsiwaju lati mu lori ni akoko.
However, we will do our best.	Sibẹsibẹ, a yoo ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
Houses, streets, trees.	Awọn ile, awọn ita, awọn igi.
It could be.	O le jẹ.
We promise ourselves.	A ṣe ileri fun ara wa.
I love everything about it.	Mo nifẹ ohun gbogbo nipa rẹ.
However, do not just play games.	Sibẹsibẹ, ma ṣe ṣe fun ere nikan.
I think of my family.	Mo ro ti ebi mi.
I have not seen them.	Emi ko tii ri wọn.
We had to keep them for several weeks.	A ni lati tọju wọn fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọsẹ.
Others believe that both are important.	Awọn miiran gbagbọ pe awọn mejeeji ṣe pataki.
After hours not so good.	Lẹhin awọn wakati ko dara julọ.
It has been used, for a long time now.	O ti lo si, fun igba pipẹ bayi.
You know how it goes.	O mọ bi o ti n lọ.
There, you see.	Nibẹ, o ri.
They are buying their community.	Wọn ni ifẹ si agbegbe wọn.
People who will not be lost.	Awọn eniyan ti kii yoo padanu.
He came home and passed out.	O wa si ile o si kọja jade.
You want to know no one like him, and you want to know more.	O fẹ ko mọ ẹnikẹni bi i, ati pe o fẹ lati mọ diẹ sii.
He stood outside the restaurant for me.	O duro ni ita ile ounjẹ fun mi.
Most people are on their way.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan wa ni ọna lori ori wọn.
You have forgotten all about it.	O ti gbagbe gbogbo nipa rẹ.
It looks like something is wrong with your box.	O dabi pe ohun kan ko tọ pẹlu apoti rẹ.
If possible, like it.	Ti o ba ṣeeṣe, fẹran rẹ.
It is an idea.	O jẹ ero kan.
It's fast.	O yara yara.
There is much to catch up on.	Nibẹ ni Elo lati yẹ soke lori.
The houses are not finished.	Awọn ile ko pari.
Chances are they won't get it.	Ni anfani lati wa ti wọn kii yoo gba.
And obviously things need to change.	Ati pe o han gbangba awọn nkan ti o nilo lati yipada.
I need to write a song.	Mo nilo lati kọ orin kan.
You work hard, talk a little.	O ṣiṣẹ lile, sọrọ diẹ.
This may take some time, of course.	Eyi le gba igba diẹ, dajudaju.
Give them a little more if they need it.	Fun wọn ni diẹ diẹ ti wọn ba nilo rẹ.
They have abandoned residential areas.	Wọn ti kọ awọn agbegbe ile silẹ.
And not for the first time.	Ati pe kii ṣe fun igba akọkọ.
No wonder they don’t stay in the world.	Ko ṣe iyanu pe wọn ko duro ni aye.
His eyes were on the river below.	Oju rẹ si wa lori odo ni isalẹ.
This is a little surprising.	Eyi jẹ iyalẹnu diẹ.
Or at least what it could be.	Tabi o kere ju kini o le jẹ.
That is my phone.	Foonu mi niyen.
There is no rest.	Ko si isinmi.
We stand, as you stand for us, for you.	A duro, bi o ti duro fun wa, fun ọ.
I had to pull my eyes out to see.	Mo ni lati fa oju mi ​​gaan lati rii.
I'll take this if you can.	Emi yoo mu eyi ti o le.
We cannot leave it.	A ko le fi i silẹ.
She was a little scared.	O bẹru diẹ diẹ.
There are just a few areas.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn agbegbe ni o kan.
I did not go.	Emi ko lọ.
Not my son.	Kii ṣe ọmọkunrin mi.
I ended up with everything else.	Mo ti pari pẹlu gbogbo nkan miiran.
Time has passed.	Akoko kan ti kọja.
I asked him what he liked.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ kini o fẹran.
You know who he is.	O mọ ẹniti o jẹ.
Conditions are also important.	Awọn ipo tun ṣe pataki.
They were found in the boot of the car.	Wọn rii ninu bata ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
It just means a lot.	O kan tumọ si pupọ.
Walking in long distances is hard on the human body.	Rin ni awọn ọna pipẹ jẹ lile lori ara eniyan.
So sooner or later they will find a way.	Nitorina laipẹ tabi ya wọn yoo wa ọna kan.
Just give me a look and go.	O kan fun mi wo o si lọ.
Going out for lunch to enjoy the sun.	Ti jade lọ fun ọsan lati gbadun oorun.
Maybe for now.	Boya fun bayi.
I want to be that person.	Mo fẹ lati jẹ eniyan naa.
You must not do that.	Iwọ ko gbọdọ ṣe iyẹn.
Let this man make a deal with you.	Jẹ ki ọkunrin yii ṣe adehun pẹlu rẹ.
It also allowed me.	O tun gba mi laaye.
It doesn't matter why.	Ko ṣe pataki idi ti.
No, that is bad advice.	Rara, iyẹn jẹ imọran buburu.
We don’t have those men.	A ko ni awọn ọkunrin naa.
We have the first thing.	A ni ohun akọkọ.
And it looks like that.	Ati pe o dabi iyẹn.
It was very fun.	O ṣe ere pupọ.
It is raining here.	Ojo nla n ro nibi.
There were no reports from the company.	Ko si iroyin lati ile-iṣẹ naa.
The way these things are done is important.	Ọna ti a ṣe awọn nkan wọnyi ṣe pataki.
You have more one.	O ni diẹ sii ọkan.
We have been here long, too long.	A ti wa nibi gun, gun ju.
Anything to do with my team work is hard for him.	Ohunkohun lati ṣe pẹlu iṣẹ ẹgbẹ mi jẹ lile fun u.
But he did not want me.	Sugbon ko fe mi.
The truth should be so.	Otitọ yẹ ki o jẹ bẹ.
I can make your mother forget that you were born.	Mo le jẹ ki iya rẹ gbagbe pe a bi ọ.
This is what makes them so good.	Eyi ni ohun ti o jẹ ki wọn dara julọ.
I will not kill him.	Emi ko ni pa a.
Such a person will not get what he wants only.	Iru eniyan bẹẹ ko ni gba ohun ti o fẹ nikan.
It’s everyone else around here.	O jẹ gbogbo eniyan miiran ni ayika ibi.
He did not understand anything.	Ko loye ohunkohun.
People do so.	Eniyan ṣe bẹ.
I did not see my father this way.	Emi ko ri baba mi ni ọna yii.
They are a great family.	Wọn jẹ idile nla kan.
And it is true.	Ati pe o jẹ otitọ.
He decided not to try.	O pinnu lati ma gbiyanju.
That changed today.	Eyi yipada loni.
Maybe they think it’s the least thing to worry about.	Boya wọn ro pe o jẹ ohun ti o kere ju lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
The money will arrive one day.	Owo naa yoo de ni ọjọ kan.
It took a long time for this to happen.	O gba akoko pipẹ fun eyi lati ṣẹlẹ.
First, you must remove all trees and cords.	Ni akọkọ, o gbọdọ yọ gbogbo awọn igi ati awọn okun kuro.
It gives us the opportunity to do better.	O fun wa ni anfani lati ṣe dara julọ.
This does not stop.	Eyi ko duro gaan.
I love that we live well in our ways.	Mo nifẹ pe a gbe daradara ni awọn ọna wa.
Personal travel with self-awareness.	Awọn irin-ajo ti ara ẹni pẹlu akiyesi ara ẹni.
I'm glad to hear that.	Inu mi dun lati gbọ iyẹn.
Lower limit on mass.	Isalẹ iye to lori ibi-.
Everything, but everything, is too much for him.	Ohun gbogbo, ṣugbọn ohun gbogbo, jẹ pupọ fun u.
The law is there.	Ofin wa nibẹ.
Nice to meet you!	O dara lati pade rẹ!
Not even through it.	Ko paapaa nipasẹ rẹ.
I do not have to worry about anything.	Emi ko ni lati ṣe aniyan nipa nkan kan.
It makes things easier.	O jẹ ki ohun rọrun.
That will help.	Iyẹn yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.
In such cases it is not necessary.	Ni iru awọn ipo bẹẹ ko nilo.
The students are friends.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe jẹ ọrẹ.
That, however, is not their only problem.	Iyẹn sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe iṣoro wọn nikan.
Times have changed for the better.	Awọn akoko ti yipada fun dara julọ.
Need now more than ever.	Nilo ni bayi diẹ sii ju lailai.
It does not teach you anything.	Ko kọ ọ ohunkohun.
That's good.	Iyẹn dara.
Nothing out there.	Ko si ohun ti o jade wa nibẹ.
Maybe they think it is too old to sell.	Boya wọn ro pe o ti dagba ju lati ta.
Going down easier than you should.	Lọ si isalẹ rọrun ju bi o ti yẹ lọ.
But they do not want to wait any longer.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko fẹ lati duro diẹ sii.
And it is for a good cause.	Ati pe o jẹ fun idi ti o dara.
The police took me to the front.	Awọn ọlọpa mu mi ni iwaju.
If you do, you will have a lot of children and no money.	Ti o ba ṣe, iwọ yoo ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde ati pe ko si owo.
It has been the talk of the town ever since. 	O jẹ ọrọ ti gbogbo eniyan lati igba naa. 
You either feel it or not.	O boya lero tabi o ko.
There is no way this can happen.	Ko si ọna ti eyi le ṣẹlẹ.
I made no mistake.	Emi ko ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
I just don’t care about anyone who will give me trouble.	Mo kan ko ṣe akiyesi ẹnikẹni ti yoo fun mi ni wahala.
First, understand how it works.	Ni akọkọ, loye bi o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
Sometimes a month can pass without rain.	Nigba miiran oṣu kan le kọja laisi ojo.
How we go about it is really important.	Bawo ni a ṣe lọ nipa rẹ jẹ ohun ti o ṣe pataki gaan.
Nor will he do it.	Tabi yoo ṣe ninu rẹ.
You do not do things the right way.	O ko ṣe awọn nkan ni ọna ti o tọ.
He almost said something, but he changed his mind.	O fẹrẹ sọ nkankan, ṣugbọn o yi ọkan rẹ pada.
It's hard not to do it when your friend is nearby.	O nira lati ma ṣe nigbati ọrẹ rẹ wa nitosi.
That doesn’t seem to be happening today.	Iyẹn ko dabi ẹni pe o ṣẹlẹ loni.
Both parties cannot agree on an agreement.	Awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji ko le gba adehun lori adehun.
Where he was born again.	Ni ibi ti o ti tun bi.
He said he wanted to talk.	O sọ pe o fẹ sọrọ.
What my friends do is you do.	Ohun ti awọn ọrẹ mi ṣe ni o ṣe.
The highest they have ever had.	O ga julọ ti wọn ti ni lailai.
The picture was taken from a plane.	A ya aworan naa lati inu ọkọ ofurufu kan.
Many of them are back again.	Pupọ ninu wọn tun pada wa.
They know each other.	Wọn mọ ara wọn.
He didn't say much to me at all.	Ko sọ pupọ fun mi rara.
The baby is in a state of shock.	Ọmọ naa wa ni ipo iyalẹnu.
I do not have a bad word to say about it.	Emi ko ni ọrọ buburu lati sọ nipa rẹ.
Someone who is important today may not be important tomorrow.	Ẹnikan ti o ṣe pataki loni le ma ṣe pataki ni ọla.
But today you will get.	Ṣugbọn loni iwọ yoo gba.
In two weeks, there are no rules.	Ni ọsẹ meji, ko si awọn ofin.
His father knew.	Baba rẹ mọ.
Acquired that on your own.	Ti gba pe lori ara rẹ.
You love the picture.	O nifẹ aworan naa.
You can do anything.	O le ṣe ohunkohun.
There was more than one meeting.	O kan ju ipade kan wa.
I want to stay clear.	Mo fẹ lati duro ko o.
There is no help.	Ko si iranlọwọ eyikeyi.
What is the reason?	Kini idi eyi.
At best not many will know about me.	Ni o dara julọ kii ṣe ọpọlọpọ yoo mọ nipa mi.
He's not as good as ever.	O si ni ko dara bi lailai.
Tomorrow will come.	Ọla yoo wa.
Anyone can change the machine time.	Ẹnikẹni le yi akoko ẹrọ pada.
I will not let you go.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki o lọ.
They slept together but did not live together.	Wọn sun papọ ṣugbọn wọn ko gbe papọ.
The world is beyond the world.	Aye kọja aye kọja.
You have heard what we heard.	O ti gbọ ohun ti a gbọ.
Many years later people returned to this problem.	Ọpọlọpọ ọdun lẹhin ti awọn eniyan pada si iṣoro yii.
There is a reason for that.	Idi kan wa fun iyẹn.
In the port.	Ninu ibudo.
This guy doesn't know anything.	Arakunrin yii ko mọ nkan kan.
He was feeling pretty low and wanted to feel better.	O si ti a rilara lẹwa kekere ati ki o fe lati lero dara.
High school people.	Awọn eniyan ile-iwe giga.
He had everything a man could want from a man.	Oun ni ohun gbogbo ti eniyan le fẹ lati ọdọ ọkunrin kan.
Maybe it will make me stay in your room.	Boya yoo jẹ ki n duro ni yara rẹ.
Or any other area.	Tabi eyikeyi miiran agbegbe.
You can read more about it here.	O le ka diẹ sii nipa rẹ nibi.
I am on board.	Mo wa lori ọkọ.
You can do wonders for yourself.	O le ṣe ohun iyanu fun ararẹ.
It just lets me drop some stuff into a bag.	O kan jẹ ki n ju ​​awọn nkan kan sinu apo kan.
I called them out.	Mo pe wọn jade.
This is, understandably, the best thing both families can do.	Eyi jẹ, o loye, ohun ti o dara julọ ti idile wọn mejeeji le ṣe.
Leave the music!	Fi orin silẹ!
I can't take it alone.	Emi ko le mu u nikan.
What day is it? 	Ọjọ wo ni?
he will ask.	oun yoo beere.
They did so before they did anything else.	Wọn ṣe bẹ ṣaaju ki wọn to ṣe ohunkohun miiran.
Always late to the game.	Nigbagbogbo pẹ si ere.
We could not hear each other.	A ko le gbọ ara wa sọrọ.
Just become more yourself.	O kan di diẹ sii funrararẹ.
I do not think you know.	Emi ko ro pe o mọ.
Same wife and same house.	Iyawo kanna ati ile kanna.
I think you will find a new company that my friend is very promising.	Mo ro pe iwọ yoo rii ile-iṣẹ tuntun ti ọrẹ mi ni ileri pupọ.
To the parents of the deceased children.	Si awọn obi ti awọn ọmọ ti o ku.
The more interesting things are the following.	Awọn diẹ awon ohun ni awọn wọnyi.
I will return to my works and you to yours.	Emi yoo pada si awọn iṣẹ mi ati iwọ si tirẹ.
Don't just stop there, do something!	Maṣe kan duro nibẹ, ṣe nkan kan!
I arrived just in time to pick up the last train.	Mo de ni akoko kan lati gba ọkọ oju irin ti o kẹhin.
But that’s what he loves about it.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ni ohun ti o nifẹ nipa rẹ.
Do not take this question for granted.	Maṣe gba bi o ṣe ni ibeere yii lori ori rẹ.
That's what it says.	Ohun ti o sọ niyẹn.
I think you called for a break.	Mo ro pe o pe fun isinmi.
The talk ended shortly after noon.	Ọrọ naa pari ni kete lẹhin ọsan.
That is why.	Idi niyẹn.
I asked him about a lot of people.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ nipa ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
This causes you to lose your space and you have to work long hours.	Eyi mu ki o padanu aaye rẹ ati pe o ni lati ṣiṣẹ pẹ.
Not my cup of tea.	Ko mi ife tii.
They say we must leave.	Wọn sọ pe a gbọdọ lọ kuro.
Two things naturally go together.	Awọn nkan meji nipa ti ara lọ papọ.
But the world has changed.	Ṣugbọn aye ti yipada.
Anyone can see that.	Ẹnikẹni le rii iyẹn.
He turned to his friend.	O yipada si ọrẹ rẹ.
They will meet them.	Wọn yoo pade wọn.
What he really wants is to sleep.	Ohun ti o fe gan ni lati sun.
I can't keep it.	Nko le pa a mo.
I do not know who he really is.	Emi ko mọ ẹni ti o jẹ gaan.
In a way I never expected.	Ni ọna ti ko nireti rara.
This is your school.	Eyi ni ile-iwe rẹ.
Maybe you know of me.	Boya o mọ ti mi.
I lift myself up again.	Mo tun gbe ara mi soke lẹẹkansi.
Over the years.	Lori awọn ọdun.
Nothing special, here.	Ko si ohun pataki, nibi.
A long time ago, in fact.	Ni igba pipẹ sẹhin, ni otitọ.
I don't want to stop anything.	Nko fe da nkankan duro.
This needs to be talked about.	Eyi nilo lati sọrọ nipa.
I'm going to come up with something good.	Emi yoo dara ki o wa pẹlu nkan ti o dara.
Please do not speak at all while we are on the phone.	Jọwọ maṣe sọrọ rara nigba ti a wa lori foonu.
To write and to read.	Lati kọ ati lati ka.
Just walk through your first fire.	O kan rin nipasẹ ina akọkọ rẹ.
It is not too late to learn.	Ko pẹ ju lati kọ ẹkọ.
They do so only when they are near someone who has the gift.	Wọn ṣe bẹ nikan nigbati o wa nitosi ẹnikan ti o ni ẹbun naa.
There were only a few games.	Nibẹ wà nikan kan diẹ awọn ere.
We can use this to help you.	A le lo eyi lati ran ọ lọwọ.
Do not ignore them.	Maṣe ṣe akiyesi wọn.
For the sun to warm us up, but not too much.	Fun oorun lati gbona wa, ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ.
Some of these old boxes are very beautiful.	Diẹ ninu awọn apoti atijọ wọnyi lẹwa pupọ.
I think people will love it.	Mo ro pe eniyan yoo nifẹ rẹ.
You have to make your own decisions.	O gbọdọ ṣe awọn ipinnu rẹ funrararẹ.
Cats, he said, have declined.	Awọn ologbo, o sọ pe, ti kọ silẹ.
They get the job done.	Wọn gba iṣẹ naa.
You have driven too fast.	O ti wakọ sare ju.
Also used at home.	Tun lo ni ile.
The houses on this road are very old.	Awọn ile ti o wa ni opopona yii ti dagba pupọ.
It was so hot, he pulled her back to bed.	O gbona pupọ, o fa u pada si ibusun.
At least a little way.	O kere ju ọna diẹ.
The future of the city is uncertain.	Ojo iwaju ilu ko ni ileri.
They start to hide.	Wọn bẹrẹ lati tọju.
Rules should always be used.	Awọn ofin yẹ ki o lo nigbagbogbo.
It helps me up.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi soke.
But nothing.	Sugbon ko si nkankan.
It means a lot to me.	O tumọ si pupọ fun mi.
Say so and be a man.	Sọ bẹ ki o jẹ ọkunrin.
He met me in front with an office hand car.	O pade mi ni iwaju pẹlu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ọwọ ọfiisi.
Are trying to understand.	Ti wa ni gbiyanju lati ni oye.
Which shouldn’t surprise me.	Eyi ti ko yẹ ki o ṣe ohun iyanu fun mi.
Anything that can happen always happens.	Ohunkohun ti o le ṣẹlẹ nigbagbogbo ṣẹlẹ.
Of course, they cannot do so.	Dajudaju, wọn ko le ṣe bẹ.
You know from it.	O mọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
It was an old car.	O je ohun atijọ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
Please wait a while.	Jọwọ duro fun igba diẹ.
That is very problematic.	Iyẹn jẹ iṣoro pupọ.
I have heard the songs and will start to change them.	Mo ti gbọ awọn orin ati ki o yoo bẹrẹ lati yi wọn.
This test can be too.	Idanwo yii le ju.
You’re moving to something.	O n gbe si nkan kan.
I look forward to my own life.	Mo nireti igbesi aye ti ara mi.
We'll keep you in touch, either.	A yoo tọju kan si, boya.
In fact, they seem to like it.	Ni otitọ, wọn dabi ẹni pe o fẹran rẹ.
That means.	Eyi tumọ si pe.
Some songs take some time to understand.	Diẹ ninu awọn orin gba akoko diẹ lati ni oye.
I stopped to help them.	Mo duro lati ran wọn lọwọ.
A little money for my life.	A kekere owo fun aye mi.
And sometimes they are not there.	Ati nigba miiran wọn ko wa nibẹ.
What will your decision be ?.	Kini ipinnu rẹ yoo jẹ?.
He has one leg, and one hand.	O ni ẹsẹ kan, ati ọwọ kan.
You need someone to look behind you and give me the job.	O nilo ẹnikan lati wo ẹhin rẹ o si fun mi ni iṣẹ naa.
You can’t be a doctor.	O ko le jẹ dokita.
Let this be our gift to the future.	Jẹ ki eyi jẹ ẹbun wa si ojo iwaju.
Sometimes it works well.	Nigba miiran o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
I have to keep it, of course.	Emi ni lati tọju rẹ, dajudaju.
Only your understanding.	Oye rẹ nikan.
That was early in the week.	Iyẹn jẹ ni kutukutu ọsẹ.
These are the members.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ.
This seems to have become more than just about the dog.	Eyi dabi pe o ti di diẹ sii ju nipa aja lọ.
I'll just pass on.	Emi yoo kan kọja lori.
Your mother will always sit there, your brother here.	Iya rẹ yoo nigbagbogbo joko nibẹ, arakunrin rẹ nibi.
We are just friends.	A jẹ ọrẹ nikan.
They were photographed.	Wọn ya aworan.
But it seems more than that to me.	Ṣugbọn o dabi diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ si mi.
It starts to run.	O bẹrẹ lati ṣiṣe.
For them we are on a summer vacation.	Fun wọn wa lori isinmi igba ooru.
Tell who is present and who is not on the train.	Sọ fun ẹniti o wa ati ẹniti ko wa lori ọkọ oju irin.
I learned first.	Mo kọ ni akọkọ.
Both at work and at home.	Mejeeji ni iṣẹ ati ni ile.
We knew it was something else.	A mọ pe o jẹ nkan miiran.
You will have it tomorrow.	Iwọ yoo ni ni ọla.
It could not have changed much.	Ko le ti yi ọpọlọpọ pada.
We should eat more or go on a diet.	A yẹ ki o jẹ diẹ sii tabi lọ lori ounjẹ.
The city has changed forever.	Ilu ti yipada lailai.
Not good enough.	Ko dara to.
I'm really looking forward to it.	Mo wa lati gba gan gan.
But we will talk.	Ṣugbọn a yoo sọrọ.
But they would be easier for me, a woman.	Ṣugbọn wọn yoo rọrun fun mi, obinrin kan.
It will not be available.	O ko ni wa.
Why no one passed him by.	Idi ti ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe kọja rẹ.
It's just your money, and that's it.	Owo rẹ nikan, ati pe iyẹn ni.
I'm still worried.	Mo tun ni aniyan.
I really wish you were here.	Mo fẹ gaan pe o wa nibi.
Maybe it’s something else.	Boya o jẹ nkan miiran.
We have friends.	A ni awọn ọrẹ.
We just want to be there.	A fẹ nikan wa nibẹ.
Make sure you lock the door when you leave.	Rii daju pe o ti ilẹkun nigbati o ba lọ kuro.
I know it will.	Mo mọ pe yoo.
Just your lot.	O kan rẹ pupọ.
He is alive, even well.	O wa laaye, paapaa daradara.
People speak up.	Awọn eniyan sọ soke.
He hit the cat on the head.	O lu ori ologbo naa.
You may need a break.	O le nilo isinmi.
People already know this.	Awọn eniyan ti mọ eyi tẹlẹ.
.	.
This is the fastest car ever built.	Eyi ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o yara ju lailai ti a kọ.
Here woman, drink this water.	Nibi obinrin, mu omi yi.
He pushed her again.	O tun ti i lẹẹkansi.
You just don't understand.	O kan ko loye.
Let thoughts fly around.	Jẹ ki awọn ero fo ni ayika.
What are we talking about?	Kini a n sọrọ nipa?
It just happens to be there.	O kan ṣẹlẹ lati wa nibẹ.
That would be a good place to start.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ aaye ti o dara lati bẹrẹ.
Let’s say some of them have a space day.	Jẹ ki a sọ pe diẹ ninu wọn ni ọjọ aaye kan.
This time he won.	Ni akoko yii o gba.
And let’s call this what it is.	Ati pe jẹ ki a pe eyi ni kini o jẹ.
Learn what to eat.	Kọ ẹkọ ohun ti o njẹ.
You have a few minutes.	O ni iṣẹju diẹ.
I don’t really drink that much anymore.	Emi ko gan mu wipe Elo mọ.
If there is a small force, make sure no one returns.	Ti agbara kekere kan ba wa, rii daju pe ko si ọkan ti o pada.
An old friend returned to town after many years.	Ọrẹ atijọ kan pada si ilu lẹhin ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
The man obviously couldn’t do much about it.	Ọkunrin naa han gbangba ko le ṣe pupọ nipa rẹ.
And, more will come.	Ati pe, diẹ sii yoo wa.
I do not, of course.	Emi ko, dajudaju.
He thought he would.	O ro pe oun yoo ṣe.
There seems to be no such thing as an impossible meal to get here.	O dabi pe ko si iru ounjẹ kan ti ko ṣee ṣe lati de ibi.
Is it a tree?	Se igi ni?
It’s great to work with.	O jẹ nla lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
Many opportunities will come your way.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn anfani yoo wa ọna rẹ.
And in fact, it is very beautiful.	Ati pe ni otitọ, o lẹwa pupọ.
Maybe you want to sit.	Boya o fẹ lati joko.
My parents were very angry.	Awọn obi mi binu gidigidi.
The beaches are beautiful.	Awọn eti okun jẹ lẹwa.
The woman's body was used everywhere.	Ibi gbogbo ni a ti lo ara obinrin naa.
I have used water.	Mo ti lo omi.
Fortunately, you lost everyone.	Da, o padanu gbogbo eniyan.
Not good for either of them.	Ko ni dara fun boya ninu wọn.
And we did.	Ati pe a ṣe.
This is not like me.	Eyi kii ṣe bii mi.
Can't remember what else.	Ko le ranti kini ohun miiran.
What a surprise !.	Kini iyanu!.
No, it was not your night.	Rara, kii ṣe alẹ rẹ.
Same as it was.	Kanna bi o ti wà.
I grew up in that house.	Mo dagba ninu ile naa.
Take a break and drink some water.	Gba isinmi ki o mu omi diẹ.
Time will tell on that.	Akoko yoo sọ lori iyẹn.
He hopes he alone will notice.	O nireti pe oun nikan yoo ṣe akiyesi.
Maybe people will get themselves in trouble with the law.	Boya eniyan yoo gba ararẹ ni wahala pẹlu ofin.
Well, they were wrong.	O dara, wọn ṣe aṣiṣe.
My father brought me back.	Baba mi mu mi pada.
This means that top drivers have to understand a lot.	Eyi tumọ si pe awọn awakọ oke ni lati ni oye pupọ.
I read about them.	Mo ka nipa wọn.
It comes from us.	O wa lati ọdọ wa.
With any of them.	Pẹlu eyikeyi ninu wọn.
I can bathe underwater for hours.	Mo le wẹ labẹ omi fun awọn wakati.
The house is amazing and has everything you need.	Ile jẹ iyanu ati pe o ni ohun gbogbo ti o nilo.
You do not need to buy your box from them.	O ko nilo lati ra apoti rẹ lọwọ wọn.
I think that's good.	Mo ro pe iyẹn dara.
I am doing so.	Mo n ṣe bẹ.
The fire is not hot.	Ina ko gbona rẹ.
Listen, he said.	Gbọ, o sọ.
You have no idea how to get out of that situation.	O ko ni imọran bi o ṣe le jade kuro ninu ipo naa.
It looks good inside.	O dara ni iyalẹnu ninu.
I think.	Mo ro pe.
At least, if they want out.	O kere ju, ti wọn ba fẹ jade.
He decided to tell the truth.	O pinnu lati sọ otitọ.
There is a game in the garden.	Ere kan wa ninu ọgba naa.
The reason is their love.	Idi ni ifẹ wọn.
He raised his hand.	O gbe ọwọ rẹ soke.
Make an appointment to see everything we have.	Ṣe ipinnu lati pade lati wo gbogbo ohun ti a ni.
We don't want to kill him.	A ko fẹ lati pa a.
Do not go from house to house.	Maṣe lọ lati ile de ile.
That’s not to say he won’t wear it.	Iyẹn kii ṣe lati sọ pe kii yoo wọ.
It will hit soon.	Yoo lu laipẹ.
We need to help.	A nilo lati ran.
Our ancestors will meet.	Awọn baba wa yoo pade.
We agreed to talk again in the morning.	A gba lati sọrọ lẹẹkansi ni owurọ.
What is this !.	Ohun ni yi!.
Before, they had closed the site for a week.	Ṣaaju ki o to, wọn ti pa aaye naa fun ọsẹ kan.
I do not really like this man.	Emi ko fẹran ọkunrin yii gaan.
Almost the same.	O fẹrẹ to kanna.
But when he met his wife and he got married.	Sugbon nigba ti o pade iyawo rẹ ati awọn ti o ni iyawo.
I have seen at least three.	Mo ti ri mẹta ni o kere.
And the longer you stay the more stressful it will become.	Ati pe to gun ti o duro ni iṣoro diẹ sii yoo di.
She'd never called him that already.	O fẹ ko pe fun u pe tẹlẹ.
There are several ways to look at this.	Awọn ọna pupọ lo wa lati wo eyi.
We don’t even have to play.	A ko paapaa ni lati mu ṣiṣẹ.
I was not interested before, but conditions have changed.	Emi ko nifẹ tẹlẹ, ṣugbọn awọn ipo ti yipada.
We also have a job to do.	A tun ni iṣẹ kan lati ṣe.
Maybe no one can help you.	Boya ko si ẹnikan ti o le ran ọ lọwọ.
I can't imagine this problem.	Emi ko le ro ero iṣoro yii.
Someone arrested me.	Ẹnikan mu mi.
Going to the school they moved for me.	Lilọ si ile-iwe ti wọn gbe fun mi.
I would definitely advise you to do so.	Emi yoo gba ọ ni imọran dajudaju lati ṣe bẹ.
He also created another drink for himself.	O tun da ohun mimu miiran fun ara rẹ.
So it’s a game.	Nitorina o jẹ ere.
He has no plans now.	Ko ni eto bayi.
Most students come back.	Pupọ julọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe pada.
I will wait for you outside.	Emi yoo duro fun ọ ni ita.
Very good job.	Gan dara ise.
But no one agrees on the terms.	Ṣugbọn ko si ọkan gba lori awọn ipo.
So of course it is important that we get there fast.	Nitorina dajudaju o ṣe pataki ki a yara wa nibẹ.
They are true to each other.	Wọn jẹ otitọ si ara wọn.
Few names.	Diẹ ni awọn orukọ.
There is a friend with me.	Ọrẹ kan wa pẹlu mi.
I hit really hard with it.	Mo lu gan lile pẹlu rẹ.
No one heard from him again.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ lẹẹkansi.
You can forget.	O le gbagbe.
Do not force yourself.	Maṣe fi agbara mu ara rẹ.
Or, that’s what it looks like.	Tabi, iyẹn ni ohun ti o dabi.
When we live here, the trees are huge.	Nigba ti a ba gbe nibi, awọn igi jẹ nla.
But it does not make it easy.	Ṣugbọn ko jẹ ki o rọrun.
Pick up anything.	Gbe soke ohunkohun.
We have to be open to what is in our lives.	A ni lati ṣii si ohun ti o wa ninu aye wa.
He said this area has a great history, and we believe.	O sọ pe agbegbe yii ni itan nla, ati pe a gbagbọ.
The two rooms look the same.	Awọn yara meji naa dabi kanna.
It has been a great help around the office.	O ti jẹ iranlọwọ nla ni ayika ọfiisi.
But you will come back.	Ṣugbọn iwọ yoo pada wa.
You do not want to leave home.	O ko fẹ lati lọ kuro ni ile.
But it worked well for me.	Ṣugbọn o ṣiṣẹ daradara fun mi.
We have a kind of football in his career.	A ni iru bọọlu kan ni iṣẹ rẹ.
I was happy for them, and happy for us.	Mo ti wà dun fun wọn, ati ki o dun fun wa.
Men are like children.	Awọn ọkunrin dabi awọn ọmọde.
Ask him how he feels about it.	Beere lọwọ rẹ bi o ṣe lero nipa rẹ.
This is enough to get us started.	Eyi ti to lati jẹ ki a bẹrẹ.
And it worked.	Ati pe o ti ṣiṣẹ.
It cannot be tested on children and adolescents.	A ko le ṣe idanwo lori awọn ọmọde ati awọn ọdọ.
But if we miss today they are gone a lot.	Ṣugbọn ti a ba padanu loni wọn ti lọ pupọ.
These are good times.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn akoko ti o dara.
You know, it was a big mistake.	O mọ, o jẹ aṣiṣe nla kan.
Today is the last day of the season.	Loni ni o kẹhin ọjọ ti awọn akoko.
We will not go out.	A kii yoo jade.
But we do not need to be afraid of groups.	Ṣugbọn a ko nilo lati bẹru awọn ẹgbẹ.
It’s time some people get out of it.	O jẹ akoko ti awọn eniyan kan jade kuro ninu rẹ.
I started to get the big picture.	Mo bẹrẹ lati gba aworan nla naa.
You will find a good place to write this.	Iwọ yoo rii ipo to dara lati kọ eyi.
One more time, he thought.	Ọkan diẹ akoko, o ro.
I told my wife and we sat down to see better.	Mo sọ fun iyawo mi ati pe a joko lati rii dara julọ.
This is a good one.	Eyi jẹ ọkan ti o dara.
He has one year left on his contract.	O ni ọdun kan ti o ku lori adehun rẹ.
Well, we can never lose again.	O dara, a ko le padanu lẹẹkansi.
Pretty much forever.	Lẹwa pupọ lailai.
There is no problem at all with this.	Ko si iṣoro rara pẹlu eyi.
Dad brought it.	Baba gbe e mu wa.
You want to continue with things.	O fẹ lati tẹsiwaju pẹlu awọn nkan.
They should expect great things from the team.	Wọn yẹ ki o reti awọn ohun nla lati ọdọ ẹgbẹ naa.
The girl is a bad girl.	Ọmọbirin naa jẹ ọmọbirin buburu.
Nothing.	Ko si nkankan.
We are looking for something that should not be here.	A n wa nkan ti ko yẹ ki o wa nibi.
Everyone on their feet.	Gbogbo eniyan lori ẹsẹ wọn.
I don't know what the company is.	Emi ko mọ kini ile-iṣẹ naa.
However, not everyone is convinced.	Sibẹsibẹ, gbogbo eniyan ko ni idaniloju.
Add a minute every other day for a couple of weeks.	Fi iṣẹju kan kun ni gbogbo ọjọ miiran fun ọsẹ meji kan.
So we go with that.	Nitorina a lọ pẹlu iyẹn.
Ko le we.	Ko le we.
I would play this guy, or write a lot of these words.	Emi yoo dun eniyan yii, tabi kọ ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrọ yii.
I have no way to say.	Emi ko ni ọna lati sọ.
It’s not that there is too much sun.	Kii ṣe pe oorun wa pupọ.
Do not write on this page.	Maṣe kọ lori iwe yii.
We had our first child, with another on the way.	A ni ọmọ akọkọ wa, pẹlu miiran ni ọna.
You always have to live two lives.	Nigbagbogbo o ni lati ṣe igbesi aye meji.
I am not a father.	Emi kii ṣe baba.
Now look at me.	Bayi wo mi.
Maybe that's also possible.	Boya iyẹn tun ṣee ṣe.
I am not a human being.	Emi kii ṣe eniyan.
We are the ones we know.	A jẹ ẹniti a mọ.
Maybe we should call a doctor.	Boya o yẹ ki a pe dokita kan.
I had to think about when it changed.	Mo ni lati ronu nipa nigbati o yipada.
Every time you leave home.	Ni gbogbo igba ti o ba lọ kuro ni ile.
I made this dish with my own hands.	Mo ṣe ounjẹ yii pẹlu ọwọ ara mi.
Whatever the man bought and sold, he was making money on.	Ohunkohun ti ọkunrin naa ra ti o si ta, o n ṣe owo lori rẹ.
But they are especially difficult for the people living in the area.	Ṣugbọn wọn nira paapaa fun awọn eniyan ti o ngbe ni agbegbe naa.
Neither know what to say.	Bẹni ko mọ ohun ti lati sọ.
Okay, obviously not for me.	O dara, o han ni kii ṣe fun mi.
I am in the garden.	Mo wa a ninu ọgba.
I can't tell you to do this.	Emi ko le sọ fun ọ lati ṣe eyi.
So he said.	Nitorina o sọ.
I have a very nice house.	Mo ni ile ti o lẹwa pupọ.
But better for everyone else.	Ṣugbọn o dara ju fun gbogbo eniyan miiran.
Are you all right now?	Se gbogbo yin ni bayi?
His friends hope he is telling the truth.	Awọn ọrẹ rẹ nireti pe o n sọ otitọ.
He never touched us.	Ko fi ọwọ kan wa rara.
He moved his seat back.	O gbe ijoko rẹ pada.
It is a place we have never been.	O jẹ aaye ti a ko ti wa.
It is amazing today.	O jẹ iyalẹnu loni.
I never enjoyed my work.	Mi o gbadun ise mi ri.
This almost works a lot.	Eyi fẹrẹ ṣiṣẹ pupọ.
It won’t happen the other way around.	Kii yoo ṣẹlẹ ni ọna miiran ni ayika.
In fact, he stuck to his seat.	Ni otitọ, o di ijoko rẹ duro.
Would you like to hear ?.	Ṣe o nifẹ lati gbọ?.
It is not work.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ.
The beaches are amazing.	Awọn eti okun jẹ iyanu.
They come from money, not.	Wọn wa lati owo, ko ṣe.
He raised his hand to her to stop.	O gbe ọwọ rẹ si i lati da duro.
All children receive music lessons.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọde gba awọn ẹkọ orin.
That is your only way.	Iyẹn jẹ ọna tirẹ nikan.
Much of it is true.	Pupọ ninu rẹ jẹ otitọ.
I have been working with them a little over a year now.	Mo ti n ṣiṣẹ pẹlu wọn diẹ diẹ sii ju ọdun kan lọ ni bayi.
It will take.	Yoo gba.
He is the only person who will ever understand me.	Oun nikan ni eniyan ti yoo loye mi lailai.
He has no idea.	Ko ni akiyesi.
That’s the other side.	Iyẹn ni ẹgbẹ miiran.
It was the most amazing thing possible to pass.	O jẹ ohun iyanu julọ ti o ṣee ṣe lati kọja.
It's all here.	Gbogbo rẹ si wa nibi.
Nice to hear.	O dun lati gbọ.
We have to come together.	A ni lati wa papọ.
He will do.	Oun yoo ṣe.
That is bad news for the student.	Iyẹn jẹ iroyin buburu fun ọmọ ile-iwe naa.
I believe there is a better way.	Mo gbagbọ pe ọna ti o dara julọ wa.
And they will need more.	Ati pe wọn yoo nilo diẹ sii.
Park your car well.	Duro si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ daradara.
This was so much better.	Eleyi je ki Elo dara.
But at some point he realized it wasn’t a game.	Ṣugbọn ni aaye kan o mọ pe kii ṣe ere.
No one died.	Ko si ọkan ti o ku.
Cannot live for anyone.	Ko le gbe fun enikeni.
Tell yourself that they did not kill the child.	Sọ fun ara rẹ pe wọn ko pa ọmọ.
The room started working more.	Yara naa bẹrẹ sii n ṣiṣẹ diẹ sii.
Or yourself.	Tabi ara rẹ.
It does when the team needs it.	O ṣe nigbati ẹgbẹ ba nilo rẹ.
Get through the good and the bad times.	Gba nipasẹ awọn akoko ti o dara ati buburu.
I also missed this man.	Mo tun padanu ọkunrin yi.
Not everything.	Ko gbogbo ohun.
My eyes are closed.	Oju mi ​​ti di.
This game knows too much about me.	Ere yi mọ ju Elo nipa mi.
Sometimes that comes in handy.	Nigba miiran iyẹn wa ni ọwọ.
I need to sit down.	Mo nilo lati joko.
Now it does not stop.	Bayi ko duro.
Someone is knocking on the door.	Ẹnikan n kan ilẹkun.
We love the house.	A nifẹ ile naa.
We won’t be convinced until we do.	A kii yoo ni idaniloju titi a yoo ṣe.
However he did not try to do so.	Sibẹsibẹ ko gbiyanju lati ṣe bẹ.
They love to be together.	Wọn fẹran lati wa papọ.
You’re doing the same thing they did.	O n ṣe ohun kanna ti wọn ṣe.
Start the program.	Bẹrẹ eto naa.
There is a head, and a hand.	Ori wa, ati ọwọ kan wa.
All your friends will be there.	Gbogbo awọn ọrẹ rẹ yoo wa nibẹ.
You did not ask my opinion.	O ko beere ero mi.
Made by history.	A ṣe nipasẹ itan.
So, this is my opinion.	Nitorina, eyi ni awọn ero mi.
We talk every few days, if not always.	A sọrọ ni gbogbo ọjọ diẹ, ti kii ba ṣe nigbagbogbo.
Or so it would seem.	Tabi bẹ yoo dabi.
Please write back.	Jọwọ kọ pada.
I will leave you with them.	Emi yoo fi ọ silẹ pẹlu wọn.
Not much right now.	Ko ṣe pupọ ni bayi.
It is pretty clear why.	O ti wa ni lẹwa ko o idi ti.
I hate them as human beings.	Mo korira wọn bi eniyan.
He stood out and touched her.	O duro jade o si fi ọwọ rẹ.
My advice is not to be afraid.	Imọran mi kii ṣe lati bẹru.
Knowing the application in more detail can also help.	Mọ ohun elo ni alaye diẹ sii tun le ṣe iranlọwọ.
Small spaces can accommodate small houses.	Awọn aaye kekere le gbe awọn ile kekere.
The time now is as it is.	Akoko ti bayi jẹ bi o ti jẹ.
He is also not sure about that.	O tun ko ni idaniloju nipa iyẹn.
Okay, let's go.	O dara, jẹ ki a lọ.
It made me feel it up.	O mu mi lero rẹ soke.
I will work to find that.	Emi yoo ṣiṣẹ lati wa iyẹn.
We will do this as soon as the meeting begins.	A yoo ṣe eyi ni kete ti ipade ba bẹrẹ.
And the night before.	Ati alẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
There is a lot of possibility at this point.	O ṣeeṣe pupọ wa ni aaye yii.
I can.	Mo ti le.
I do not understand any of it.	Emi ko loye eyikeyi ninu rẹ.
They walked back to his house.	Wọn rin pada si ile rẹ.
He is no longer a man, but he is just a big boy.	Oun kii ṣe ọkunrin mọ, ṣugbọn o kan jẹ ọmọ nla kan.
He also did not know.	O tun ko mọ.
Sure, people will always play the program.	Daju, eniyan yoo ma ṣe ere eto naa nigbagbogbo.
Everyone needs to play this.	Gbogbo eniyan nilo lati mu eyi ṣiṣẹ.
And a few others.	Ati awọn miiran diẹ.
It has access to information that no human being can have.	O ni aaye si alaye ti ko si eniyan laaye le ni.
Your time will come soon.	Akoko rẹ yoo wa laipẹ.
They happen in every class.	Wọn ṣẹlẹ ni gbogbo kilasi.
It should be around.	O yẹ ki o wa ni ayika.
It seems like you are both on very friendly terms.	O dabi ẹni pe iwọ mejeeji wa lori awọn ofin ọrẹ pupọ.
Your day is here.	Ọjọ rẹ wa.
Two of you are with me.	Meji ninu yin wa pẹlu mi.
In class.	Ninu kilasi.
That would even have to be legal.	Iyẹn yoo ni lati fi ofin de paapaa.
The future is not for them.	Ojo iwaju ko si fun wọn.
We became their team.	A di ẹgbẹ wọn.
You want to get what’s behind you.	O fẹ lati gba ohun ti o wa lẹhin rẹ.
It will not surprise me at least.	Yoo ko ohun iyanu fun mi ni o kere.
He told me we could be on our way.	O sọ fun mi pe a le wa ni ọna wa.
But that is not the case now.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọrọ naa ni bayi.
His hand reached out to reach her before she caught herself.	Ọwọ rẹ jade lati de ọdọ rẹ ṣaaju ki o to mu ara rẹ.
I'm not sure what to do.	Emi ko ni idaniloju kini lati ṣe.
Many people have gone home in the morning.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan owurọ ti lọ si ile.
Listen to your music.	Gbọ orin rẹ.
He sent her a letter.	O fi lẹta ranṣẹ si i.
He was born there and he has.	O ti bi nibẹ ati awọn ti o ni.
I don’t think they even make them anymore.	Emi ko ro pe wọn paapaa ṣe awọn mọ.
This is a love story.	Eyi jẹ itan ifẹ.
But it doesn’t look so good.	Sugbon o ko ni wo ki o dara.
But even that was not in my heart.	Ṣugbọn paapaa iyẹn ko wa ninu ọkan mi.
We will all be there.	Gbogbo wa yoo wa nibẹ.
But, really, look again.	Ṣugbọn, ni otitọ, wo lẹẹkansi.
You are the only one I have.	Iwọ nikan ni mo ni.
We agree.	A gba.
Life changes in a minute.	Igbesi aye yipada ni iṣẹju kan.
I hope they do too.	Mo nireti pe wọn tun ṣe.
Do not worry about small details.	Maṣe ṣe wahala lori awọn alaye kekere.
He thought and thought, but could not remember.	O ronu ati ronu, ṣugbọn ko le ranti.
Honestly, really try.	Ṣe ni otitọ, gbiyanju gaan.
You are not your primary concern.	Iwọ kii ṣe aniyan akọkọ rẹ.
Thus, there are two types.	Bayi, awọn iru meji wa.
How similar they are.	Bawo ni iru wọn.
That's the only job.	Iṣẹ naa nikan niyẹn.
Read again.	Ka lẹẹkansi.
So do we need more water?	Nitorina ṣe a nilo omi diẹ sii?
I think that’s how it should be.	Mo ro pe iyẹn jẹ bi o ti yẹ ki o jẹ.
We will not leave.	A ko ni kuro.
Doctors do the hard work.	Awọn dokita ṣe iṣẹ ti o nira.
Maybe not, 'he said.	Boya kii ṣe,' o sọ.
This time he decided to write.	Ni akoko yii o pinnu lati kọ.
Not just here.	Ko kan wa nibi.
I notice you always do that.	Mo ṣe akiyesi pe o ṣe iyẹn nigbagbogbo.
I will not do such a thing.	Emi kii yoo ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ.
It's fun to live.	O dun lati gbe.
I have always been such a person.	Mo ti jẹ iru eniyan nigbagbogbo.
Try in every way they know how to find.	Gbiyanju ni gbogbo ọna ti wọn mọ bi wọn ṣe le rii.
Not just for the things you need.	Ko kan fun awọn ohun ti o nilo.
I am doing well.	Mo n ṣe daradara.
I mean, it's my son.	Mo tumọ si, ọmọ mi ni.
More than 200 people attended the concert.	O ju igba eniyan lo wa nibi ere orin naa.
Nor does it make him feel better.	Bẹni ko mu u lero dara.
We will need to drop some trees soon.	A yoo nilo lati ju awọn igi diẹ silẹ laipẹ.
I do not know anyone else to turn to.	Emi ko mọ ẹni miiran lati yipada si.
When you have time of course.	Nigbati o ba ni akoko dajudaju.
Some questions were asked about his great speech.	Diẹ ninu awọn ibeere ni a beere nipa ọrọ nla rẹ.
Or they know something we don’t.	Tabi wọn mọ ohun kan ti a ko.
That is work for others to do, for men to do.	Iyẹn jẹ iṣẹ fun awọn miiran lati ṣe, fun awọn ọkunrin lati ṣe.
I even love it.	Mo paapaa nifẹ rẹ.
In fact, there are very few with them.	Ni otitọ, diẹ diẹ ni o wa pẹlu wọn.
I'm sure both will be great.	Mo ni idaniloju pe awọn mejeeji yoo jẹ nla.
Community and life.	Agbegbe ati aye.
You want to find out more.	O fẹ lati wa diẹ sii.
But no one seemed to be able to tell me.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o dabi ẹni pe o le sọ fun mi.
The boy left himself in his studies.	Ọmọkunrin naa fi ara rẹ silẹ ninu awọn ẹkọ rẹ.
That’s kind of it, especially.	Iyẹn ni iru eyi, paapaa.
Do not be with me forever.	Maṣe wa pẹlu mi lailai.
But for him it was not.	Ṣugbọn fun u kii ṣe.
Give him anything, you can handle it.	Fun u ohunkohun, o le mu o.
In his room on the bed.	Ninu yara rẹ lori ibusun.
There is only one way to find out.	Ọna kan nikan lati wa.
So much easier.	Ki Elo rọrun.
He also brought me another cup of tea.	O tun mu ife tii miiran fun mi.
But they find their way.	Ṣugbọn wọn wa ọna wọn.
News makes your day.	Awọn iroyin ṣe ọjọ rẹ.
This city will change forever.	Ilu yi yoo yipada lailai.
He came down on his own.	O wa silẹ lori ara rẹ.
I will never forget.	Emi ko gbagbe lati gbagbe.
Times were hard in those days.	Awọn akoko jẹ lile ni awọn ọjọ yẹn.
I can't die like this.	Nko le ku bi eleyi.
We get to eat.	A gba lati jẹ.
Eating great food also made him hungry again.	Njẹ ounjẹ nla tun jẹ ki ebi pa a lẹẹkansi.
But this is where we went wrong.	Ṣugbọn eyi ni ibi ti a ti lọ ni aṣiṣe.
I don't want to live with it anymore.	Emi ko fẹ lati gbe pẹlu rẹ mọ.
Just let it go.	O kan jẹ ki o lọ.
Try to put yourself in your shoes.	Gbiyanju lati fi ara rẹ sinu bata rẹ.
We know he will rise again.	A mọ pe oun yoo dide lẹẹkansi.
He raised his hand to me.	O gbe ọwọ rẹ si mi.
Everyone loves and accepts the truth.	Gbogbo eniyan ni ife ati gba otitọ.
Turns out you know you want to get it.	Wa ni jade o mọ pe o fe gba o.
I know everyone tells you this, but it really needs to happen.	Mo mọ pe gbogbo eniyan sọ eyi fun ọ, ṣugbọn o nilo lati ṣẹlẹ gaan.
They live together.	Wọn gbe papọ.
At least at work.	O kere ju ni iṣẹ.
They draw attention to themselves.	Wọn fa oju si ara wọn.
Do not think of anything.	Maṣe ro ohunkohun.
You've got nothing out.	O ti ni ohunkohun ti jade.
I have no money to pay for items.	Emi ko ni owo lati san fun awọn ohun kan.
You can't go wrong.	O ko le ṣe aṣiṣe.
There is no evil love.	Ko si ife buburu.
It is this thing that needs your attention.	O jẹ nkan yii ti o nilo akiyesi rẹ.
Go or walk your feet a few feet to your body.	Lọ tabi rin ẹsẹ rẹ ni ẹsẹ diẹ si ara rẹ.

In fact, they can be much better.	Ni otitọ, wọn le dara ju pupọ julọ lọ.
He has taken me where He wants me.	O ti gba mi ni ibi ti o fẹ mi.
Now there is plenty of food, but not in the right places.	Bayi ọpọlọpọ ounjẹ wa, ṣugbọn kii ṣe ni awọn aaye to tọ.
Lots more details.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn alaye diẹ sii.
All my love.	Gbogbo ife mi.
You can think about it on the couch.	O le ronu nipa rẹ lori ibusun.
He lives in a small town outside the city.	O ngbe ni ilu kekere kan ni ita ilu naa.
That sounds good.	Iyẹn dabi pe o dara.
I did not.	Emi ko ṣe bẹ.
I do not want it at all.	Nko fe e rara.
Most people say three, but it is not true.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan sọ mẹta, ṣugbọn kii ṣe otitọ.
It is not something that other parties are forced to do.	Kii ṣe ohun ti a fi agbara mu awọn ẹgbẹ miiran lati ṣe.
Do not look angry.	Maṣe wo inu binu.
And what is the idea behind that? 	Ati pe kini ero lẹhin iyẹn?
I don’t know much about them.	Emi ko mọ pupọ nipa wọn.

It has been going on for months and months.	O ti n lọ fun awọn oṣu ati awọn oṣu.
But they did not.	Sugbon ti won ko.
I hope you do.	Mo nireti pe o ṣe.
It couldn’t be enough for him.	Ko le ṣe to fun u.
For some reason he stayed home.	Fun idi kan o duro si ile.
Not until all your legs can begin to move.	Kii ṣe titi gbogbo awọn ẹsẹ rẹ le bẹrẹ lati gbe.
They knocked on your door, sent a letter.	Wọn kan ilẹkun rẹ, fi lẹta ranṣẹ.
So that's what you told him.	Nitorina ohun ti o sọ fun u niyẹn.
Of course the time is not over.	Dajudaju akoko naa ko tii pari.
And he was right about it.	O si tọ nipa rẹ.
Not for such work.	Kii ṣe fun iru iṣẹ bẹẹ.
That means he is not here.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe ko si nibi.
Not on this.	Ko lori eyi.
You can't live there now.	O ko le gbe nibẹ ni bayi.
I hope you do.	Mo nireti pe o ṣe.
However, you may have other resources as well.	Sibẹsibẹ, o le ni awọn ohun elo miiran bi daradara.
He did not speak to them.	Ko ba wọn sọrọ.

Don't you think we need this?	Ṣe o ko ro pe a nilo eyi?
He said women would love it.	O sọ pe awọn obinrin yoo nifẹ rẹ.
You can move.	O le gbe.
This is more than that.	Eyi jẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
We get back well when they change.	A gba pada daradara nigbati wọn yipada.
We do not worry about making the right decisions in life.	A ko ṣe aniyan nipa ṣiṣe awọn ipinnu ti o tọ ni igbesi aye.
But it was something to do.	Sugbon o je nkankan lati se.
They will not believe your story.	Wọn ko ni gbagbọ itan rẹ.
I'm going to take them out.	Emi yoo lọ mu wọn jade.
Some planes have seats that turn into beds.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọkọ ofurufu ni awọn ijoko ti o yipada si ibusun.
At least now it has a little help.	O kere ju bayi o ni iranlọwọ diẹ.
But no one can tell me what it is.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹniti o le sọ fun mi kini o jẹ.
You’re calling it, because something is wrong.	O n pe e, nitori nkan ti ko tọ.
It’s not one of his jobs.	Kii ṣe ọkan ninu iṣẹ rẹ.
He lives here.	O ngbe nibi.
He has no place to go.	Ko ni ibi lati lọ.
Like the last.	Bi ti o kẹhin.
He was tired all the time.	O ti re ni gbogbo igba.
Two are dead.	Meji ti ku.
That amount is for sure.	Iye yẹn daju.
They can help.	Wọn le ṣe iranlọwọ.
This situation is also wrong.	Ipo yii tun jẹ aṣiṣe.

Once you lose those people, you will never get them back.	Ni kete ti o padanu awọn eniyan yẹn, iwọ kii yoo gba wọn pada.
I’m not sure how to do this.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bi o ṣe le ṣiṣẹ eyi.
I can be anyone.	Mo le jẹ ẹnikẹni.
Give the money back.	Fun owo naa pada.
I don’t see how that is possible.	Emi ko rii bi iyẹn ṣe ṣee ṣe.
He promised to return early in the morning.	O ṣe ileri lati pada ni kutukutu owurọ.
At that moment, she found out he loved her.	Ni akoko yẹn, o rii pe o nifẹ rẹ.
Their cars are too fast!	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wọn yara ju!
The books are great.	Awọn iwe jẹ nla.
He has no power to stop it.	Ko ni agbara lati da a duro.
This is no small matter.	Eyi kii ṣe nkan kekere.
You can't believe it.	O ko le gbagbọ.
You should read them.	O yẹ ki o ka wọn.
She decided to open her eyes.	O pinnu lati ṣii oju rẹ.
And that was hard enough.	Ati awọn ti o wà lile to.
My father has become an object now.	Baba mi ti di ohun o bayi.
You think it is yours.	O ro pe o jẹ tirẹ.
I can't really see the error.	Emi ko le rii aṣiṣe naa gaan.
And it should.	Ati pe o yẹ.
He never showed it to anyone.	Ko fi enikeni han rara.
It was my time to try.	O jẹ akoko mi lati gbiyanju.
There is not much water.	Ko si pupọ omi.
His mother agreed.	Iya re gba.
Her mother watched as she grew up on vacation.	Iya rẹ wo bi o ti n dagba ni isinmi.
My time has come.	Akoko mi ti de.
They never thought about me.	Wọn ko ronu nipa mi rara.
I think he was there.	Mo ro pe o wa nibẹ.
It can be very helpful for people who work now.	O le ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ fun awọn eniyan ti o ṣiṣẹ ni bayi.

Your future is in their hands.	Ojo iwaju rẹ wa ni ọwọ wọn.

It is completely over the top.	O jẹ patapata lori oke.
I have three cats.	Mo ni ologbo mẹta.
In fact, any member can do this.	Ni otitọ, eyikeyi ọmọ ẹgbẹ le ṣe eyi.
He did not live for a long time.	Ko gbe fun igba pipẹ.
Apparently both are dead.	O han ni awọn mejeeji ti ku.
Someone is talking.	Ẹnikan n sọrọ.
I'm in one right now.	Mo wa ninu ọkan ni bayi.

This is something important.	Eyi jẹ nkan pataki.
Some of us.	Diẹ ninu wa.
The price is right.	Iye owo naa tọ.
Large fires damaged many homes.	Ina nla ba ọpọlọpọ awọn ile jẹ.
You love this.	O nifẹ eyi.
She looked around the room.	O wo ni ayika yara naa.
Can you explain more?	Ṣe o le ṣe alaye diẹ sii bi?
It breaks our hearts.	O fọ ọkan wa.
The man had seen them, but had not tried to stop them.	Ọkunrin naa ti ri wọn, ṣugbọn ko gbiyanju lati da wọn duro.
Just my personal opinion.	O kan mi ti ara ẹni ero.
I took advantage of the opportunity.	Mo lo anfani anfani.
We will find everything there is to know about it.	A yoo wa ohun gbogbo ti o wa lati mọ nipa rẹ.
But they are, in fact, there for him.	Ṣugbọn wọn wa, ni otitọ, nibẹ fun u.
Most of our youth are uneducated.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọdọ wa ko ni ẹkọ.
Good.	O dara.
Many are going with it.	Ọpọlọpọ n lọ pẹlu rẹ.
He left his hand.	O fi ọwọ rẹ silẹ.
I hope something changes.	Mo nireti pe ohun kan yipada.
You never know when you'll end up.	Iwọ ko mọ pe iwọ yoo gbe.
They can't just go and write.	Wọn ko le kan lọ kọ silẹ.
There is nothing to do about it.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣe nipa rẹ.
The boat is on the beach.	Ọkọ naa wa lori okun.
If a man has to work it can be bad.	Ti ọkunrin kan ba gbọdọ ṣiṣẹ o le ṣe buburu.
My wife does everything.	Iyawo mi ṣe ohun gbogbo.
This has become important.	Eyi ti di pataki.
No, they say, you are doing a good job.	Rara, wọn sọ pe, o n ṣe iṣẹ to dara.
That person, whoever he is, can be a lot of people.	Eniyan yẹn, ẹnikẹni ti o ba jẹ, le jẹ ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
When nothing happened, he tried again.	Nigbati ohunkohun ko ṣẹlẹ, o tun gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
That costs a lot of money to sign.	Iyẹn jẹ owo pupọ lati fi ọwọ si.
I told people about it.	Mo sọ fun eniyan nipa rẹ.
We see many names.	A wo ọpọlọpọ awọn orukọ.
It could have been better.	O le ti dara julọ.
You can not do it before or after.	O ko le ṣe ṣaaju tabi lẹhin naa.
We never did.	A ko ṣe rara.
Ji kuro.	Ji kuro.
It means you can change the story.	O tumọ si pe o le yi itan pada.
He had gone from night to day again.	O ti lọ lati alẹ si ọjọ lẹẹkansi.
I notice you are reading.	Mo ṣe akiyesi pe o n ka.
I know them.	Mo mọ wọn.
We will meet you this weekend.	A yoo pade rẹ ni ipari yii.
The car, no, returned home at night.	Ọkọ, ti ko si, pada si ile ni alẹ.
This is not about them.	Eyi kii ṣe nipa wọn.
I have the first application.	Emi ni ohun elo akọkọ.
There are reasons for that.	Awọn idi wa fun iyẹn.
He ended his life with his own hands.	O pari aye rẹ pẹlu ọwọ ara rẹ.
You are all dead.	Gbogbo yin ti ku.
I can't do anything right.	Emi ko le ṣe ohunkohun ti o tọ.
We hope you too !.	A nireti pe iwọ pẹlu!.
It made them want to talk to me, to ask questions.	O jẹ ki wọn fẹ lati ba mi sọrọ, lati beere awọn ibeere.
Not much at first, but we noticed.	Ko ṣe pupọ ni akọkọ, ṣugbọn a ṣe akiyesi.
It does not mean it did not happen.	Ko tumọ si pe ko ṣẹlẹ.
This baby is not my daughter.	Ọmọ yii kii ṣe ọmọbirin mi.
It was for his own good.	O je fun ara rẹ ti o dara.
But it can be important, too.	Ṣugbọn o le ṣe pataki, paapaa.
But only if you want to.	Ṣugbọn nikan ti o ba fẹ.
There is no family law.	Ko si ofin idile.
Stand by.	Duro diẹ.

It was about killing my family, but they agreed on it.	O nipa pa ebi mi, sugbon ti won gba lori o.
You are going to be nearby.	O ti wa ni lilọ lati wa nitosi.
It’s time for me to be serious.	O to akoko fun mi lati ṣe pataki.
We have a lot to talk about.	A ni ọpọlọpọ lati sọrọ nipa.
Books and articles are sometimes written about his work.	Awọn iwe ati awọn nkan ni a kọ nigba miiran nipa iṣẹ rẹ.
I see it in every day.	Mo ti ri ninu rẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
They have nothing to return to.	Wọn ko ni nkankan lati pada si.
They know, too.	Wọn mọ, paapaa.
People know this and come to me for advice.	Eniyan mọ eyi ati ki o wa si mi fun imọran.
We asked for it the first day.	A beere fun ọ ni ọjọ akọkọ.
That is what they are for, good and bad times.	Iyẹn jẹ ohun ti wọn jẹ fun, ti o dara ati awọn akoko buburu.
We look forward to meeting you in person.	A nireti lati pade rẹ ni eniyan.
He had nothing to beat me.	Ko ni nkankan lati lu mi.
Water is the most obvious liquid.	Omi jẹ omi ti o maa n han gbangba.
You have decided that it is enough.	O ti pinnu pe o to.
I have never been happy every day in my life.	Mo ti ko dun ni gbogbo ọjọ ninu aye mi.
Will continue to work on this.	Yoo tẹsiwaju lati ṣiṣẹ lori eyi.
Install the new driver and this test will work.	Fi awakọ tuntun sinu ati idanwo yii o ṣiṣẹ.
Sometimes the two get one.	Nigba miiran awọn meji gba ọkan.
And the same thing applies to high school.	Ati ohun kanna si ile-iwe giga.
There is nothing surprising about the game.	Ko si ohun iyanu nipa ere naa.
Neither is it a decision we make.	Bẹni kii ṣe ipinnu a ṣe.
I just don’t want to try anymore.	Mo kan ko fẹ gbiyanju mọ.
A good team would have been good even without me.	Ẹgbẹ ti o dara yoo ti dara paapaa laisi mi.
Nothing, as you can see.	Ko si nkankan, bi o ti le rii.
We haven't seen it in a long time.	A ko tii ri i fun igba pipẹ.

I have met that already.	Mo ti pade pe tẹlẹ.
I dressed with one hand, holding my side.	Mo wọ aṣọ pẹlu ọwọ kan, di ẹgbẹ mi mu.
An hour has passed.	Wakati kan ti kọja.
I have to buy one.	Mo ni lati ra ọkan.
However, there are other applications.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ohun elo miiran wa.
Not able to get another dog, of course.	Ko ni anfani lati gba aja miiran, dajudaju.
Things seem to work out well in the end.	Awọn nkan dabi pe o ṣiṣẹ daradara ni ipari.
You get to go.	O gba lati lọ.
Give yourself some time to come.	Fun ara rẹ ni akoko diẹ lati wa.
Hours passed.	Awọn wakati ti kọja.
She was old enough to be his mother.	O ti dagba to lati jẹ iya rẹ.
It does not mean that my men do not.	Ko tumọ si pe awọn ọkunrin mi ko.
Something unexpected.	Nkankan ti a ko reti.
Who owns it.	Tani o ni.
One day, on a car trip, we became friends.	Ni ọjọ kan, irin-ajo ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan, a di ọrẹ.
He did not sleep for a week.	Ko sun fun ọsẹ kan.
I do not understand what the problem might be.	Emi ko loye kini iṣoro naa le ṣee jẹ.
And that does not seem to be the case.	Ati pe ko dabi ẹni pe iyẹn yoo ṣẹlẹ.
This will not hurt.	Eyi kii yoo ṣe ipalara.
A small fire broke out in a nearby house.	Ina kekere kan ṣẹlẹ ni ile kan ti o wa nitosi.
Open it as you would a book.	Ṣi i bi o ṣe fẹ iwe kan.
Okay, whatever that stuff is.	O dara, ohunkohun ti nkan naa jẹ.
Maybe less.	Boya o kere si.
I want to say it is our time.	Mo fẹ sọ pe o jẹ akoko wa.
I can feel it rising.	Mo le rilara pe o dide si oke.

Or to drive it.	Tabi lati wakọ rẹ.
Try to get back into our world.	Gbiyanju lati pada si aye wa.
Everyone expects it	Gbogbo eniyan nireti rẹ
One more at a time.	Ọkan diẹ diẹ ni akoko kan.
Something in her eyes kept her mouth shut.	Nkankan ni oju rẹ pa ẹnu rẹ mọ.
First, if we do not like the bed we can return it.	Ni akọkọ, ti a ko ba fẹran ibusun a le da pada.
We need to remember the past.	A nilo lati ranti awọn ti o ti kọja.
You know what to do.	O mọ ohun ti o gbọdọ ṣe.

This is a good one, though.	Eyi jẹ ọkan ti o dara, paapaa.
Here, let me.	Nibi, jẹ ki mi.
Work day is over.	Ọjọ iṣẹ ti pari.
Everyone turned to that one.	Gbogbo eniyan yipada si ọkan yẹn.
We were both amazing.	A wà mejeeji iyanu.
It is one of the great.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn nla.
You do not believe.	O ko gbagbọ.
But it was too late.	Sugbon o ti pẹ.
Leave a comment for the kids.	Fi ero kan silẹ fun awọn ọmọde.
We just haven't been here long.	A o kan ko ti nibi gun.
Don't.	Maṣe ṣe.
If your statement is true.	Ti ọrọ rẹ ba jẹ otitọ.
Things would have happened in a way that you knew they would.	Awọn nkan yoo ti ṣẹlẹ ni ọna ti o mọ pe wọn yoo.
This is another.	Eyi jẹ miiran.
Do not forget to read a book.	Maṣe gbagbe lati ka iwe kan.
I do not believe it was an accident.	Emi ko gbagbọ pe o jẹ ijamba.
I went to see it.	Mo lọ wo o.
On your word.	Lori ọrọ rẹ.
But more came to him.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii wa si i.
This world is outside the laws of time and space.	Aye yii wa ni ita awọn ofin ti akoko ati aaye.
Use clean, warm water.	Lo omi ti o mọ, ti o gbona.
Drivers are poorly paid.	Awọn awakọ ti wa ni ibi ti san.
And it is important that you continue.	Ati pe o ṣe pataki ki o tẹsiwaju.
In the end, only one came out.	Ni ipari, ọkan nikan ni o jade.
But we also want to change.	Ṣugbọn a tun fẹ lati yipada.
The door opened behind him and he looked back.	Ilẹkun naa ṣi silẹ lẹhin rẹ o si wo sẹhin.
I'm not sure they even spend money.	Emi ko da mi loju pe wọn paapaa lo owo.
That ends now.	Iyẹn pari ni bayi.
The company has its offices in this building.	Ile-iṣẹ naa ni awọn ọfiisi rẹ ni ile yii.
But it is something.	Sugbon o jẹ nkankan.
He did not write one but two great books.	O ko kọ ọkan sugbon meji nla iwe.
Everything has to be in place and now it is there.	Ohun gbogbo ni lati wa ni ipo ati bayi o wa.
We made that decision.	A ṣe ipinnu naa.
We are there.	A wà wa.
It is impossible to decide.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati pinnu.
I asked him where he was.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ pe ibi ti o wa.
I'm sure you understand why.	Mo da mi loju pe o loye idi.
But look at these ideas for what they are.	Ṣugbọn wo paapaa awọn ero wọnyi fun kini wọn jẹ.
I learn, grow, write and open my heart.	Mo kọ ẹkọ, dagba, kọ ati ṣii ọkan mi.

We're skipping that space.	A n fo aaye yẹn.
But no, that's a mistake.	Ṣugbọn rara, iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe.
Learn more about us and.	Kọ ẹkọ diẹ sii nipa wa ati.
It seems to come from more than one person.	O dabi pe o wa lati ọdọ eniyan diẹ sii ju ọkan lọ.
He said nothing at all.	Ko sọ ohunkohun rara.
He hopes to have more power.	O nireti lati ni agbara diẹ sii.
History books are not good.	Awọn iwe itan ko dara.
Head of any.	Ori ti eyikeyi.

You may not want to know me.	O le ma fẹ lati mọ mi.
He was in school at the time.	O wa ni ile-iwe ni akoko yẹn.
She laughed off.	O rẹrin si pa.
This is the right time to buy a house.	Eyi ni akoko ti o tọ lati ra ile kan.
But that is not all.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe iyẹn nikan.
They did not ask questions.	Wọn ko beere ibeere.
He refused to talk to me.	O kọ lati ba mi sọrọ.
You can go.	O le lọ.

He always woke up from everywhere he worked.	O nigbagbogbo ji lati ibi gbogbo ti o ṣiṣẹ.
I hope they come soon.	Mo nireti pe wọn wa laipẹ.
He has a family.	O ni idile kan.
These benefits should be noted.	Awọn anfani wọnyi yẹ ki o ṣe akiyesi.
You might as well not even have one.	O le bi daradara ko paapaa ni ọkan.
More seafood is available these days.	Awọn ounjẹ okun diẹ sii wa ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
It was a great time in life.	O jẹ akoko nla ni igbesi aye.
You can not say who the people are.	O ko le so ti awon eniyan ni o wa.
I have a lot too.	Mo ni pupọ paapaa.
And it is not true at the same time.	Ati pe kii ṣe otitọ ni akoko kanna.
That is not for obvious reasons.	Iyẹn kii ṣe nitori awọn idi ti o han gbangba.
I don't want one of that.	Emi ko fẹ ọkan ninu iyẹn.
One woman and two men.	Obinrin kan ati ọkunrin meji.
Don't try to be like anyone else.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati dabi ẹnikẹni miiran.

He waited and waited for a long time.	O duro o duro fun igba pipẹ.
It has gone to their heads.	O ti lọ si ori wọn.
Her hair is beautiful!	Irun rẹ jẹ lẹwa!
I love doing that, really.	Mo nifẹ ṣiṣe iyẹn, ni otitọ.
Conditions, perhaps, to change one's one to the past '.	Awọn ipo, boya, lati yi ọkan ká ọkan si awọn ti o ti kọja'.
There was that, at least.	Nibẹ wà pe, ni o kere.
Not just a background idea.	Ko o kan kan lẹhin ero.
But let’s get back to us.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki a pada si wa.
I don’t think you want to go into this.	Emi ko ro pe o fẹ lọ sinu eyi.
No one knows what is wrong.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ ohun ti ko tọ.

They are too old to understand.	Wọn ti dagba ju lati loye.
So he dropped it.	Nitorina o sọ ọ silẹ.
Get out of the fire!	Lọ kuro ninu ina!
It will not be the first time this has happened to us.	Kii yoo jẹ igba akọkọ ti o ṣẹlẹ si wa.
These men are afraid, of course, but they love their job.	Awọn ọkunrin wọnyi bẹru, dajudaju, ṣugbọn wọn fẹran iṣẹ wọn.
Not out of the car.	Ko jade ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.

For one thing, it matters how much you make.	Fun ohun kan, o ṣe pataki iye awọn ti o ṣe.
If the matter is cut, do not be offended.	Ti ọrọ naa ba ge, maṣe binu.
You have to love and be loved.	O ni lati nifẹ ati fẹran rẹ.

If so, ask her to wait for us.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, beere lọwọ rẹ lati duro fun wa.
She has a lot of hair on her.	O ni irun pupọ lori rẹ.
When you find it, you use that value.	Nigbati o ba rii, o lo iye yẹn.
That is my word.	Ọrọ mi niyẹn.
He used my name.	O lo orukọ mi.
We have been in the house ever since.	A ti wa ninu ile lati igba naa.
They know it.	Wọn mọ fun rẹ.
They have been with this for a long time.	Wọn ti pẹ diẹ pẹlu eyi.
However, that is good.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn dara.
When a man marries a woman they become one body.	Nigbati ọkunrin ba fẹ obinrin kan wọn di ara kan.
Do these things, and you will come out.	Ṣe nkan wọnyi, ati pe iwọ yoo jade.
At one time nothing, no thought or sound.	Ni akoko kan ohunkohun, ko si ronu tabi ohun.
But they must not know that.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko gbọdọ mọ iyẹn.

You have to stop that or something will happen.	O gbọdọ da pe tabi nkankan yoo ṣẹlẹ.

Maybe it was her husband.	Boya o jẹ ọkọ rẹ.
At least not alone.	O kere ju ko jẹ nikan.

Pictures in the same year.	Awọn aworan ni ọdun kanna.
He is a family man.	O jẹ ọkunrin idile.
The truth is.	Otitọ ni gaan.
That may not be there.	Iyẹn le ma wa nibẹ.
Please tell me if you do.	Jọwọ sọ fun mi ti o ba ṣe.
It seems to exist, but maybe not.	O dabi pe o wa, ṣugbọn boya kii ṣe.

Upstairs, he stopped.	Ni oke, o duro.
It will be sunny tomorrow, but good.	Yoo jẹ oorun ni ọla, ṣugbọn dara.
We will be back after vacation.	A yoo pada wa lẹhin isinmi.

Your feet, your mouth.	Ẹsẹ rẹ, ẹnu rẹ.
Not sure what you want.	Ko daju ohun ti o fẹ.
And to save that time.	Ati lati tọju akoko yẹn.
There were cities in this area	Awọn ilu ni agbegbe yi wà
I was the last one standing.	Emi ni ẹni ikẹhin ti o duro.
If so, return the value.	Ti o ba jẹ, da iye pada.
Now you are talking serious money.	Bayi o ti n sọrọ pataki owo.
I love power.	Mo nifẹ agbara.
She has a baby outside who needs it.	O ni ọmọ kan ni ita ti o nilo rẹ.
He often sent the children to bed early.	Nigbagbogbo o fi awọn ọmọde ranṣẹ si ibusun ni kutukutu.
Once that work is done, you have to leave.	Ni kete ti iṣẹ yẹn ba ti pari, o ni lati lọ kuro.
You have no interest in me.	O ko ni anfani si mi.
I don’t think anyone deserves it.	Emi ko ro pe ẹnikẹni yẹ.
You have to stay that way.	O ni lati duro ni ọna yẹn.

I will stop at the train station.	Emi yoo duro ni ibudo ọkọ oju irin.
Where it should be, for whatever reason.	Ibi ti o yẹ ki o wa, fun ohunkohun ti idi.
After many years, not to think of it.	Lẹhin ọpọlọpọ ọdun, kii ṣe lati ronu rẹ.
I will never do this to my son.	Emi ko ni ṣe eyi si ọmọ mi lailai.
They look young and beautiful.	Wọn dabi ọdọ ati lẹwa.
Of course, only what you think matters.	Dajudaju, ohun ti o ro nikan ni o ṣe pataki.
Before you put everything together.	Ṣaaju ki o to fi ohun gbogbo papọ.
He never told his parents.	Ko sọ fun awọn obi rẹ rara.
You must have had a hard week.	O gbọdọ ti ni ọsẹ lile kan.
In a few years we will not come again.	Ni ọdun diẹ a kii yoo wa mọ.
It turns out he knew it.	O wa ni jade pe o mọ ọ.
You have to make a decision.	O ni lati ṣe ipinnu.
It is on my way.	O wa lori ọna mi.
It's raining cats and dogs.	Ojo ti de lori ise.
The child becomes more difficult words.	Ọmọ naa di awọn ọrọ ti o nira sii.
Not for your teacher.	Kii ṣe fun olukọ rẹ.
The sister was even more beautiful nearby.	Arabinrin naa paapaa lẹwa diẹ sii nitosi.
It is in the city.	O ti wa ni ilu.
I saw him in front.	Mo ri i ni iwaju.
Your work can.	Iṣẹ rẹ le.
That question is not over.	Ibeere yẹn ko kọja.
I would say she is a wonderful woman.	Emi yoo sọ pe obinrin iyanu ni.
We can also do that here.	A tun le ṣe iyẹn nibi.
You want to read your book in the afternoons.	O fẹ lati ka iwe rẹ ni awọn ọsan.
They are too late to go.	Wọn ti pẹ ju lati lọ.
But not me.	Sugbon ko si mi.
You just have to give space.	O kan ni lati fun aaye.
I don't really care.	Emi ko ṣe akiyesi gaan.
I would like to read three books about the trip.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ka awọn iwe mẹta nipa irin-ajo naa.
Okay, that’s what the team and I decided to do.	O dara, iyẹn ni emi ati ẹgbẹ ti pinnu lati ṣe.
But he knew he at least had to appear.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe o kere ju ni lati han si.
You know the pictures.	O mọ awọn aworan.
He expects this.	O nireti eyi.
This will make it impossible to continue.	Eyi yoo jẹ ki ko ṣee ṣe lati tẹsiwaju.
Bread is an important food.	Akara jẹ ounjẹ pataki.
I don't want to see her hurt.	Emi ko fẹ lati rii ipalara rẹ.
Leaving the store wearing them they look good.	Ti lọ kuro ni ile itaja ti o wọ wọn wọn dara daradara.
I sit on my bed.	Mo joko lori ibusun mi.
The boat broke into two.	Ọkọ naa fọ si meji.
They are all great people to be with.	Gbogbo wọn jẹ eniyan nla lati wa pẹlu.
That woman, she said.	Obinrin yẹn, o sọ.
I miss that a lot.	Mo padanu iyẹn pupọ.
This happens to everyone.	Eleyi ṣẹlẹ si gbogbo eniyan.
Nothing serious from what you said.	Ko si ohun to ṣe pataki lati ohun ti o sọ.
Of course there was.	Dajudaju nibẹ wà.
However, maybe you have a point.	Sibẹsibẹ, boya o ni aaye kan.
Stop talking.	Duro sọrọ.
You can do anything.	O ṣee ṣe ohunkohun.
No one about.	Ko si ẹnikan nipa.
When they passed, we continued.	Nigbati wọn ba kọja, a tẹsiwaju.
Probably fast in bed.	Yara sun oorun ni ibusun jasi.
And the house already caught fire.	Ati ile tẹlẹ ti mu ina.

This is our place to be.	Eyi ni aaye wa lati wa.
You know me well, especially.	O mọ mi daradara, paapaa.

You just want the best for me.	O kan fẹ ohun ti o dara julọ fun mi.
It's like the old weeks.	O dabi awọn ọsẹ atijọ.
I told myself you weren’t really important to me.	Mo sọ fun ara mi pe iwọ ko ṣe pataki si mi gaan.
It’s his story even in the matter.	O jẹ itan rẹ paapaa ninu ọrọ naa.
What was wrong with the girl was understandable.	Ohun ti o jẹ aṣiṣe pẹlu ọmọbirin naa loye.
Both are important to learn.	Awọn mejeeji ṣe pataki lati kọ ẹkọ.
No hot food for three days.	Ko si ounjẹ gbona fun ọjọ mẹta.
I suspect he was one of them.	Mo fura pe o jẹ ọkan ninu rẹ.
The company built a new facility.	Ile-iṣẹ naa kọ ile-iṣẹ tuntun kan.
He was educated, not afraid, by details.	O ti kọ ẹkọ, ko bẹru, nipasẹ awọn alaye.
They were there until we started.	Wọn wa titi ti a fi bẹrẹ.
He lives in this new area.	O ngbe ni agbegbe tuntun yii.
You'd never seen anything like it.	O fẹ ko ri ohunkohun bi o.
I do not know enough to try such a thing.	Emi ko mọ to lati gbiyanju iru nkan bẹẹ.
But it depends on it.	Ṣugbọn o duro lori rẹ.
So they are not the same.	Nitorina wọn kii ṣe kanna.
Everyone does.	Gbogbo eniyan ṣe.
Well we will see.	Daradara a yoo ri.
The money was worth it this time.	Awọn owo je tọ o akoko yi.
If you can call them honestly.	Ti o ba le pe wọn ni otitọ.
Some of them know a lot about running a restaurant.	Diẹ ninu wọn mọ pupọ nipa ṣiṣe ile ounjẹ kan.
How do you know what a dog will do.	Bawo ni o ṣe mọ ohun ti aja yoo ṣe.
I want to be loved by everyone.	Mo fe lati wa ni feran nipa gbogbo eniyan.
Kids love games.	Awọn ọmọde fẹran awọn ere.
Very same place with art.	Ibi gan kanna pẹlu aworan.
You agree that you should accept the offer.	O ti gba pe o yẹ ki o gba iṣẹ naa.
You can't finish your breakfast.	O ko le pari ounjẹ owurọ rẹ.
It returns from any service used in.	O pada lati iṣẹ eyikeyi ti a lo ninu.
Now take another picture.	Bayi ya aworan miiran.
Hard, across the face.	Lile, kọja oju.
You know enough about me.	O mọ to mi.
For this reason, a point has become important.	Fun idi eyi, aaye kan ti di pataki.
It is not new.	Kii ṣe tuntun.
He wants to stop it from happening.	O fe lati da o lati ṣẹlẹ.
It doesn’t take that at all to work well.	Ko gba iyẹn rara lati ṣiṣẹ daradara.
That is very important.	Nkan pataki niyen.
You are one and you are one of them.	O ti wa ni ọkan ati pe o ti wa ninu gbogbo wọn.
Truth.	Otitọ.
Many of them came out this morning.	Pupọ ninu wọn jade ni owurọ yii.
Read the following statements.	Ka awọn ọrọ wọnyi.
No, that is not the case.	Rara, kii ṣe iyẹn.
I have to find it as soon as possible.	Mo ni lati wa a ni kete bi o ti ṣee.
You will see why in a minute.	Iwọ yoo rii idi ni iṣẹju kan.
I have one last thing to ask you.	Mo ni ohun kan kẹhin lati beere lọwọ rẹ.
Of course you know.	Dajudaju o mọ.
I can’t seem to change that here.	Emi ko le dabi lati yi iyẹn pada nibi.
I stood back but it caught me and that was it.	Mo duro sẹhin ṣugbọn o mu mi ati pe iyẹn ni.
Is it because of the summer? 	Ṣe nitori igba ooru ni?
I do not know.	Emi ko mọ.
Neither child is harmed.	Bẹni ọmọ ko ni ipalara.
There are very few of them now.	Nibẹ ni o wa gidigidi diẹ ninu wọn bayi.
It really shook my life.	O mi aye gan.
We jumped at the chance.	A fo ni anfani.
They said they would continue to travel.	Wọn sọ pe wọn yoo tẹsiwaju lati rin irin-ajo.
He doesn't know why he dropped his voice.	Ko mọ idi ti o fi sọ ohun rẹ silẹ.
But the ideas are not long.	Ṣugbọn awọn imọran lẹwa ko pẹ.
Maybe that won’t change.	Boya iyẹn kii yoo yipada.
How long has that been?	Bawo ni o ti pẹ to ti iyẹn ti jẹ.
I'll go first.	Emi yoo lọ ni ina akọkọ.
I raise my hand.	Mo gbe ọwọ soke.
Okay, no more.	O dara, ko si mọ.
He is talking to me.	O n ba mi sọrọ.
So that's what you call me.	Nitorina ohun ti o pe mi niyẹn.
You will never see him or anyone like you anymore.	Iwọ kii yoo ri i tabi ẹnikẹni bi rẹ mọ.
There are some places you should not go only at night.	Awọn aaye kan wa ti o ko yẹ ki o lọ nikan ni alẹ.
Maybe it's true is another matter.	Boya o jẹ otitọ jẹ ọrọ miiran.
He slept longer than he ate.	O sun gun ju o jẹun.
We will use energy only when power is needed.	A yoo lo agbara nikan nigbati agbara ba nilo.
His eyes closed on me.	Oju rẹ pa si mi.
They can also make the money work.	Wọn tun le jẹ ki owo naa ṣiṣẹ.
Not your husband.	Ko ọkọ rẹ.
People are good.	Eniyan ni o dara.
He will not take advantage of the situation.	Oun kii yoo lo anfani ti ipo naa.
Everyone in town knows us.	Gbogbo eniyan ni ilu mọ wa.
I hate that idea.	Mo korira ero yẹn.
So this is well known.	Nitorina eyi ti mọ daradara.
They are good, and they have visited the site.	O dara wọn jẹ, ati pe wọn ti ṣabẹwo si aaye naa.
It is important to try to keep it.	O ṣe pataki lati gbiyanju lati tọju rẹ.
I can't put my hand on it.	Emi ko le fi ọwọ mi si i.
They have power and police, but for a long time.	Wọn ni agbara ati ọlọpa, ṣugbọn fun igba pipẹ.
But it must end.	Ṣugbọn o gbọdọ pari.
Only to happen every month for a year.	Nikan lati ṣẹlẹ ni gbogbo oṣu fun ọdun kan.
I will talk to him.	Emi yoo ba a sọrọ.
Kids always walk around barefoot, especially in summer.	Awọn ọmọde nigbagbogbo n lọ ni ayika laisi bata, paapaa ni igba ooru.
He knew and yet did not do so.	O mọ ati sibẹsibẹ ko ṣe bẹ.
It must be.	O gbọdọ jẹ.
If you do not know, do not.	Ti ko ba mọ, ko ni.
That is some question.	Iyẹn jẹ diẹ ninu awọn ibeere.
But my husband is gone.	Ṣugbọn ọkọ mi ti lọ.
To me it seemed a lot.	Fun mi o dabi enipe pupọ.
I don’t think about it, he said.	Emi ko ronu nipa rẹ, o sọ.

He did not give me tea.	Ko fun mi ni tii.
Drinks did so for him.	Ohun mimu ṣe bẹ fun u.
This is the last life, my son.	Eyi ni aye ti o kẹhin, ọmọkunrin mi.
But he was knocking on the door.	Ṣugbọn o n yi ọwọ ilẹkun.
That is not breakfast.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ounjẹ owurọ.
Something real did not surprise us.	Nkankan ti o daju ko ṣe ohun iyanu fun wa.

I do not think he will come back until tomorrow.	Emi ko ro pe oun yoo pada wa titi di ọla.

Below are some of them.	Ni isalẹ wa ni diẹ ninu wọn.
The truth is what they are trying to hide.	Otitọ ni ohun ti wọn n gbiyanju lati tọju.

For the day.	Fun ọjọ naa.
I like meeting advice.	Mo fẹran imọran ipade.
I could force him to speak.	Mo ti le fi agbara mu u lati sọrọ.
It’s even more rewarding.	O jẹ ere paapaa pupọ.
Head to your table with your dinner.	Ori si tabili rẹ pẹlu ounjẹ alẹ rẹ.
Here, get out of my hands.	Nibi, gba kuro ni ọwọ mi.
So they can expect.	Nitorina wọn le nireti.

We should stop here and call for help.	A yẹ ki o duro nibi ki o si pe fun iranlọwọ.
But you have heard what happened.	Ṣugbọn o ti gbọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Before you go you will have decided what to do with me.	Ṣaaju ki o to lọ iwọ yoo ti pinnu kini lati ṣe pẹlu mi.
Finished or almost finished, housewives keep their running errands.	Ti pari tabi ti fẹrẹ pari, awọn iyawo ile tọju awọn iṣẹ ṣiṣe wọn.

He was there, along with two men.	O wa nibẹ, pẹlu awọn ọkunrin meji.
No matter, beautiful people.	Ko si ohun ti, eniyan lẹwa.
There is no way to explain it.	Ko si ọna lati ṣe alaye rẹ.

Maybe that’s why you can.	Boya iyẹn ni idi ti o fi le.
Do just make them up.	Ṣe o kan ṣe wọn soke.

There are some things we can do right now that can help.	Awọn ohun kan wa ti a le ṣe ni bayi ti o le ṣe iranlọwọ.
And we played three games.	Ati pe a ṣe awọn ere mẹta.
He did not think about the fact that his father was dead.	O ko ronu nipa otitọ pe baba rẹ ti ku.
The more you do this, the better you will get.	Bi o ṣe n ṣe eyi diẹ sii, yoo dara julọ iwọ yoo gba ni.
Mary and my sister live here.	Mary ati arabinrin mi ngbe nibi.
This sister is visiting her hometown.	Arabinrin yii n ṣabẹwo si ilu rẹ.

But not for long, because he knew what it was.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe fun igba pipẹ, nitori o mọ ohun ti o jẹ.
That is more than most can say.	Iyẹn ju ọpọlọpọ lọ le sọ.

That is not the right way.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ọna ti o tọ.
They seem to have left the city, however.	Wọn dabi pe wọn ti lọ kuro ni ilu, sibẹsibẹ.
I do not feel so.	Emi ko lero bẹ.

As you can see everything works as expected.	Bi o ti le ri ohun gbogbo ṣiṣẹ bi o ti ṣe yẹ.
She likes to live alone.	O fẹran lati gbe nikan.
Not everyone has things either.	Ko gbogbo eniyan ni o ni awon ohun boya.
You are all tired.	O ti rẹ gbogbo yin.
Let's see what is on your table.	Jẹ ki a wo kini o wa ninu tabili rẹ.
For you, this is a clean face.	Fun ọ, eyi jẹ oju ti o mọ.
I try not to think about what comes next.	Mo gbiyanju lati ma ronu nipa ohun ti o wa lẹhin.
They go everywhere.	Wọn lọ nibi gbogbo.
We believe it was a mistake to obtain the information.	A gbagbọ pe o jẹ aṣiṣe lati gba alaye naa.
They lose light, or maybe they don't have it.	Wọn padanu ina, tabi boya wọn ko ni i.
We did the right thing.	A ṣe ohun ti o tọ.
Listen, it’s life.	Gbọ, o jẹ igbesi aye.

You need time for yourself to think.	O nilo akoko fun ararẹ lati ronu.

There are still people who are not touched by fire.	Awọn eniyan ṣi wa ti ko ni ọwọ nipasẹ ina.
They work well and they work well.	Wọn ṣiṣẹ daradara ati pe wọn ṣiṣẹ daradara.
Same as all the others.	Kanna bi gbogbo awọn miiran.
Give a lot of time.	Fun ni akoko pupọ.
The question is whether it exists or not.	Ibeere naa jẹ boya o wa tabi rara.
Usually not at home at night.	Nigbagbogbo ko wa ni ile ni alẹ.
Better than just.	Dara ju o kan ju.
They all look old.	Gbogbo wọn dabi ti atijọ.
I hope you take the seat.	Mo nireti pe o gba ijoko naa.
I don’t want to force the issue.	Emi ko fẹ lati fi agbara mu ọrọ naa.
No sense in telling you now - I don't wanna ruin the suprise.	Ko si ori lati binu lori rẹ.
You've got one.	O ti ni ọkan.
That has no value at all.	Iyẹn ko ni iye si ohunkohun.

He lowered his eyes and closed his mouth.	O rẹ oju rẹ silẹ o si pa ẹnu rẹ mọ.
The world is the place of the whole world.	Ile aye ni ibi ti gbogbo aye.
There are several things at work in it.	Awọn nkan pupọ lo wa ni iṣẹ ninu rẹ.
She looked at her husband's face.	O wo oju ọkọ rẹ.

Inside and outside, inside and outside.	Ninu ati ita, ninu ati ita.
They become a test for information.	Wọn di idanwo fun alaye.

This can be done in two ways.	Eyi le ṣee ṣe ni awọn ọna meji.
He is not sitting on it now.	Ko joko lori rẹ ni bayi.
I could be wrong now.	Mo le ṣe aṣiṣe ni bayi.
Sometimes it is used as a fire.	Nigba miiran a maa n lo bi ina.
He never told me.	Ko so fun mi rara.
It is always wise to have people not buy.	Nigbagbogbo o jẹ oye lati ni awọn eniyan ko ra.
Ask about them.	Beere nipa wọn.
I never did.	Emi ko ṣe e rara.
This is a story that will draw children.	Eyi jẹ itan ti yoo fa awọn ọmọde.
We will figure something out.	A yoo ro nkan jade.
I would even take care of it if it was a boy.	Emi yoo paapaa tọju rẹ ti o ba jẹ ọmọkunrin.
Good to laugh again and think about the old days.	O dara lati rẹrin lẹẹkansi ati ronu nipa awọn ọjọ atijọ.
He believed that people should take care of themselves.	O gbagbọ pe eniyan yẹ ki o tọju ara wọn.
Teach people to do this.	Kọ eniyan lati ṣe eyi.
I agree with everything that everyone has said.	Mo gba pẹlu ohun gbogbo ti gbogbo eniyan ti sọ.
One is.	Ọkan jẹ.
You can not pass them by.	O ko le kọja wọn.
You can know yourself, but not talk about it.	O le mọ ara rẹ, ṣugbọn ko sọrọ nipa rẹ.
I wish you could help me.	Mo fẹ pe o le ran mi lọwọ.
Give them a try.	Fun wọn gbiyanju.
If not, stay there.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, o duro nibẹ.
The baby is OK.	Ọmọ naa dara.
I don’t even get why.	Emi ko paapaa gba idi ti.
You go back, read what they said, and say more.	O pada, ka ohun ti wọn sọ, ati pe o sọ diẹ sii.
He thought he would have to break his way.	O ro pe oun yoo ni lati ya ọna rẹ kọja.
You’re better, maybe, than yours.	O dara julọ, boya, ju tirẹ lọ.
One day he will have his time with the man.	Ni ọjọ kan oun yoo ni akoko rẹ pẹlu ọkunrin naa.
No one has ever feared me before.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ti bẹru mi tẹlẹ.
He also said.	O tun sọ.
I remember sitting in a high chair.	Mo ranti pe mo joko ni ijoko giga kan.
We think we missed it.	A ro pe a padanu rẹ.
I will not accept your terms.	Emi ko ni gba si awọn ofin rẹ.
You do not think this through.	O ko ronu eyi nipasẹ.
She laughed out loud.	O rẹrin ga.
But he always knew.	Ṣugbọn o mọ nigbagbogbo.
You have to give me some advice.	O ni lati fun mi ni imọran.
There is no other person around.	Ko si eniyan miiran ni ayika.
He brought me there.	O mu mi wa nibẹ.
I don't deserve to have them anymore.	Emi ko yẹ lati ni wọn mọ.
This is one of those situations.	Eyi jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ipo yẹn.
Word starts to come out.	Ọrọ bẹrẹ lati jade.
The pictures are great, the stories are really tight.	Awọn aworan jẹ nla, awọn itan jẹ gan ju.
That should be sufficient enough.	Iyẹn ti to.
I can tie one of my birthday dresses.	Mo le di ọkan ninu awọn aṣọ ọjọ ibi mi.
Because it was something pretty special.	Nitori o je nkankan lẹwa pataki.
It is in my car.	O wa ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi.
They are very small.	Wọn kere pupọ.
But they did not accept.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko gba.
Just got a great one.	O kan ni ọkan nla.
To your eyes.	Si oju rẹ.
However we learn from ourselves, often.	Sibẹsibẹ a kọ ẹkọ lati ọdọ ara wa, nigbagbogbo.
He is still doing it.	O tun n ṣe e.
And no.	Ati pe ko si.
Have you traveled by train?	Ti rin irin-ajo nipasẹ ọkọ oju irin?
Let them guide you to where you need to go.	Jẹ ki wọn tọ ọ lọ si ibi ti o nilo lati lọ.
I did not hit anyone.	Emi ko lu ẹnikẹni.
I do not know how to tell.	Nko mo bi mo se so fun.
He will be disappointed.	Oun yoo jẹ adehun.
They did not tell you that.	Wọn ko sọ fun ọ pe.
The method that works is very simple.	Ọna ti o ṣiṣẹ jẹ rọrun pupọ.
You can be on a trip.	O le wa lori irin-ajo.
And that works well in that.	Ati ṣiṣẹ daradara ni iyẹn.
You may not talk to me anymore.	O le ma ba mi sọrọ mọ.
If you do.	Ti o ba ṣe.
I have to do this.	Mo gbọdọ ṣe eyi.
If you knew me, you would have loved me as much as you love me.	Ti o mọ ọ, iwọ yoo ti fẹran rẹ bi o ṣe fẹran mi.
She walked into her room.	O rin sinu yara rẹ.
I can try that.	Mo le gbiyanju iyẹn.
It's too fast.	O yara ju.
You have to find a place to sleep for the night.	O ni lati wa ibi kan lati sun fun alẹ.
Nothing will make the problem worse.	Ko si ohun ti yoo jẹ ki iṣoro naa lọ gaan.
These take time.	Awọn wọnyi gba akoko.
In this it works great.	Ni yii o ṣiṣẹ nla.
Of course we think like this.	Dajudaju a ronu bii eyi.
He raised his head and looked at me.	O gbe ori soke o si wo mi.
I love to be called a human school.	Mo nifẹ lati pe ni ile-iwe eniyan.
It is possible that we have passed with it.	O ṣee ṣe pe a ti kọja pẹlu rẹ.
Some even come and go in a few months.	Diẹ ninu awọn paapaa wa ati lọ ni nkan ti oṣu diẹ.
I have never had a house of my own.	Emi ko tii ni ile kan ti ara mi.
It’s a lot to think about.	O jẹ pupọ lati ronu.
His wife and children are here.	Iyawo ati awọn ọmọ rẹ wa nibi.
Some of them got married.	Diẹ ninu wọn ṣe igbeyawo.
You have done it yourself.	O ti ṣe e funrararẹ.
Everything else can stand.	Ohun gbogbo miiran le duro.
I will refund the money.	Emi yoo da owo naa pada.
That you sent me.	Wipe o ran mi.
This is my person.	Eleyi jẹ mi eniyan.
This is something you will write or should write if you write.	Eyi ni ohun ti iwọ yoo kọ tabi yẹ ki o kọ ti o ba kọ.
He drank some water.	O mu omi kan.
Let's see how it goes.	Jẹ ká wo bi o ti lọ.
The boy gets into trouble, the boy gets hurt.	Ọmọkunrin gba sinu wahala, ọmọkunrin ni ipalara.
That, friends, is history for another time.	Iyẹn, awọn ọrẹ, jẹ itan fun akoko miiran.
He understood that he was dying.	O loye pe oun n ku.
I was very afraid that someone would come.	Mo bẹru pupọ pe ẹnikan yoo wa.
Drinking is the problem.	Mimu ni iṣoro naa.
That's why!	Idi re niyen!.
I was the only one using my phone.	Emi nikan ni mo lo foonu mi.
They had not talked much that morning.	Wọn ko ti sọrọ pupọ ni owurọ yẹn.
In fact, so deserves your whole life.	Ni otitọ, bẹ yẹ gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ.
I don’t feel like myself.	Emi ko lero bi ara mi.
You can go either way.	O le lọ boya ọna.
I may have missed it.	Mo ti le ti padanu rẹ.
No one is there.	Ko si ẹnikan nibẹ.
That's how he looks at me.	Bi o ṣe n wo mi niyẹn.
You know, think outside the box.	O mọ, ronu ni ita apoti.
I even take a week off to work out.	Mo paapaa gba isinmi ọsẹ kan lati ṣiṣẹ jade.
I met him at a restaurant last night.	Mo pade rẹ ni ile ounjẹ kan ni alẹ ana.
It looks amazing.	O wo iyanu.
They are always laughing.	Nigbagbogbo wọn n rẹrin.
She is doing everything she can to help them.	O n ṣe gbogbo ohun ti o le ṣe lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun wọn.
Fire needs more wood.	Ina nilo igi diẹ sii.
We will meet at the top of the office building.	A o pade ni oke ile ọfiisi.
All on your own.	Gbogbo lori ara rẹ.
I like it less.	Mo fẹran rẹ kere si.
It’s a whole new system.	O jẹ gbogbo eto tuntun.
There is no need to walk all the way.	Ko ba ti wa ti o ba ni lati rin ni gbogbo ọna.
Now it can be anyone.	Bayi o le jẹ ẹnikẹni.
This is not the way.	Eyi kii ṣe ọna naa.
We think we have arrived.	A ro pe a ti de.
Just make everything more difficult.	O kan jẹ ki ohun gbogbo nira sii.
There is no way for me to be convinced.	Ko si ọna fun mi lati ni idaniloju.
I was skeptical about the location of the boat.	Mo ṣiyemeji nipa ipo ti ọkọ oju omi naa.
I miss you so much.	Mo padanu re pupo.
I slept next to me.	Mo sun ni ẹgbẹ mi.
There is no place for you here, you have to know that.	Ko si aaye fun ọ ni ibi, o ni lati mọ iyẹn.
That was three years ago.	Iyẹn jẹ ọdun mẹta sẹhin.
Nothing like this will ever happen to you again.	Ko si iru eyi ti yoo ṣẹlẹ si ọ lẹẹkansi.
His team arrived yesterday morning.	Ẹgbẹ rẹ de ni owurọ ana.
Stand.	Duro.
You have done enough, and you should go home to them.	O ti ṣe to, ati pe o yẹ ki o lọ si ile si wọn.
Of course, there are ways to work around this.	Dajudaju, awọn ọna wa lati ṣiṣẹ ni ayika eyi.
One let the other be.	Ọkan jẹ ki awọn miiran jẹ.
Near their homes.	Nitosi awọn ile wọn.
I am saying such because it is true.	Mo n sọ iru bẹ nitori otitọ ni.
Still all went well.	Ṣi gbogbo lọ daradara.
How much will it cost for the meal?	Elo ni yoo jẹ fun ounjẹ naa?
Before time, work on your tone.	Ṣaaju akoko, ṣiṣẹ lori ohun orin rẹ.
And yet he took.	Ati sibẹsibẹ o mu.
I already have my time.	Mo ti ni akoko mi tẹlẹ.
Of course it happens to everyone, but even so.	Dajudaju o n ṣẹlẹ si gbogbo eniyan, ṣugbọn paapaa bẹ.
The children were delighted when they received a great gift.	Inu awọn ọmọde dun nigbati wọn gba ẹbun nla kan.
People are saying something about my family.	Eniyan n sọ nkan nipa idile mi.
If we lose ourselves, that’s the end.	Ti a ba padanu ara wa, iyẹn ni ipari.
But something seems wrong.	Ṣugbọn ohun kan dabi aṣiṣe.
Around and around.	Ni ayika ati ni ayika.
I have your mother.	Mo ni iya rẹ.
How can we ensure that this does not happen again?	Bawo ni a ṣe le rii daju pe eyi ko ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi?
But after all it doesn’t matter.	Ṣugbọn lẹhin gbogbo ko ṣe pataki.
We will see them.	A yoo ri wọn.
That has never happened to me before.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ si mi tẹlẹ.
You can give her beautiful clothes.	O le fun u ni awọn aṣọ lẹwa.
I played it through in my head.	Mo ti dun o nipasẹ ninu mi ori.
He picked up the phone.	O gbe foonu naa.
I did not know he was there until after the truth.	Emi ko mọ pe o wa nibẹ titi lẹhin otitọ.
But he did.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe.
You'll have to wait.	O ni lati duro.
However, it is not a very good value for time or money.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe iye ti o dara pupọ fun akoko tabi owo.
Life can be when you are young.	Igbesi aye le nigbati o wa ni ọdọ.
I just have to believe.	Mo kan ni lati gbagbọ.
It is too late to get up in bed today.	O ti kọja akoko lati dide lori ibusun loni.
Enjoy your holiday.	Gbadun isinmi ọjọ rẹ.
He lives in his own world.	O ngbe ni aye ti ara rẹ.
It's all very beautiful.	Gbogbo rẹ lẹwa pupọ.
You will be home soon.	Iwọ yoo wa si ile laipẹ.
So they put the matter to rest.	Nitorina wọn fi ọrọ naa si isinmi.
You can’t do this every other week.	O ko le ṣe eyi ni gbogbo ọsẹ miiran.
It continued for what seemed like several minutes.	O tẹsiwaju fun ohun ti o dabi awọn iṣẹju pupọ.
Just nothing interesting.	O kan ohunkohun awon.
A board game for two players.	A ọkọ ere fun meji awọn ẹrọ orin.
When they had a big lunch, they went to sleep.	Nigbati wọn jẹ ounjẹ ọsan nla kan, wọn lọ sun.
It will do the same for you.	O yoo ṣe kanna fun ọ.
Think about our child.	Ronu nipa ọmọ wa.
We are happy.	Inu wa dun.
Don't talk.	Maṣe sọrọ.
And that's not that great of a doctor.	Ati awọn ti o ni ko wipe nla ti a dokita.
I will bring my brother home.	Emi yoo mu arakunrin mi wa si ile.
I do not want this to happen to my book.	Emi ko fẹ ki eyi ṣẹlẹ si iwe mi.
They do not seem to have seen us.	Wọn ko dabi pe wọn ti ri wa.
But this is not about what they want.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe nipa ohun ti wọn fẹ.
The city is full of people with money.	Ilu naa kun fun eniyan pẹlu owo.
That is a good explanation not to be mistaken.	Iyẹn jẹ alaye ti o dara lati ma ṣe aṣiṣe.
Where he went.	Ibi ti o ti lọ.
That will not help the situation.	Iyẹn kii yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun ipo naa.
It has what people get when they do.	O ni ohun ti eniyan gba nigbati wọn ṣe bẹ.
She hates to leave home.	O korira lati lọ kuro ni ile.
He will not be able to take either.	Oun kii yoo ni anfani lati ya boya.
There is no room to return to the office.	Ko si aaye lati pada si ọfiisi.
It has been very difficult.	O ti le gidigidi.
But the problem is still there.	Ṣugbọn iṣoro naa tun wa nibẹ.
You can see that.	O le rii iyẹn.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Ma binu fun yin.
Finish the conversation.	Pari ọrọ naa.
There is nothing that people do not decide to know.	Ko si ohun ti eniyan ko pinnu lati mọ.
We entered his room.	A wọ inu yara rẹ.
He has been there many times.	O ti wa nibẹ ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
It's my body.	Ara mi ni.
Or you will die.	Tabi iwọ yoo ku.
I work hard.	Mo ṣiṣẹ pupọ.
Can't find this.	Ṣe o ko le rii eyi.
He also refused.	O tun kọ.
That is not a big question.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ibeere nla kan.
We hope for your understanding.	A nireti fun oye rẹ.
He saw me staring into it, and turned away.	O ri mi ti n wo inu rẹ, o si yipada kuro.
They love it so much.	Wọn nifẹ rẹ pupọ.
I waited for him to continue, and he did.	Mo duro fun u lati tẹsiwaju, o si ṣe.
I wish it would not.	Mo fẹ ko yoo.
His approach is uncertain.	Ọna rẹ jẹ ṣiyemeji.
But that's the whole story.	Sugbon ti o ni gbogbo itan.
And he does not accept gifts.	Ati pe ko gba awọn ẹbun.
Now you need to have some rest.	Bayi o nilo lati ni isinmi diẹ.
Of course she lost her husband.	Dajudaju o padanu ọkọ rẹ.
These tests are important.	Awọn idanwo wọnyi jẹ pataki.
This should not be surprising.	Eyi ko yẹ ki o jẹ iyalẹnu.
I thought of everything.	Mo ti ro ti ohun gbogbo.
The information does not apply to me.	Alaye naa ko kan mi.
They may feel you tried.	Wọn le lero pe o gbiyanju.
I can't think of anything to say.	Nko le ronu nkan kan lati sọ.
I’ve seen it here, here, and here.	Mo ti ri nibi, nibi, ati nibi.
I worry about my future.	Mo ṣe aniyan nipa ọjọ iwaju mi.
He did not come back.	Ko pada wa.
But that is not all.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe iyẹn nikan.
We’re all doing it here.	A n ṣe gbogbo wa nibi.
I was invited to tea.	Won pe mi si tii.
I wish for this.	Mo ti fẹ fun eyi.
I was two years living it down.	Mo ti wà odun meji ngbe o si isalẹ.
He did not see anything.	O ṣe ko si ri nkankan.
He is the source of all this.	Oun ni aaye ti gbogbo eyi.
Tell us your thoughts !.	Sọ ero rẹ fun wa!.
I need you to tell me you are human right now.	Mo nilo ki o sọ fun mi pe o jẹ eniyan ni bayi.
I want a build on.	Mo fẹ a se lori.
So, work hard.	Nitorina, ṣiṣẹ lile.
It's time to dump her.	O to akoko lati pada.
You find that you don't need much food or sleep anymore.	O rii pe ko nilo ounjẹ pupọ tabi oorun mọ.
These things can be seen.	Awọn nkan wọnyi le rii.
And they were lighted.	A si si wọn ina.
Get those that work.	Gba awọn ti o ṣiṣẹ.
It just doesn’t matter.	O kan ko ṣe pataki.
New plan for the site.	Eto tuntun fun aaye naa.
I love that girl.	Mo nifẹ ọmọbirin yẹn.
No, it is not.	Rara, kii ṣe bẹẹ.
I just let it out.	Mo ni o kan jẹ ki o jade.
I do not want to talk about this.	Emi ko fẹ lati sọrọ nipa eyi.
Make sure all words are in capital letters.	Rii daju pe gbogbo awọn ọrọ jẹ awọn lẹta nla.
Find a way to give back.	Wa ọna lati fun pada.
I can't do this.	Emi ko le ṣe eyi.
It is needed.	O ti nilo.
I'm talking.	Mo n sọrọ.
And at one point he didn’t come back up.	Ati ni akoko kan ko pada wa soke.
Take life.	Gba aye.
Not good.	Ṣe ko dara.
It will make it much easier for us to kill ourselves.	Yoo jẹ ki o rọrun pupọ fun wa lati pa ara wa.
It works well.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara.
If you find anything, post it here.	Ti o ba ri ohunkohun, fi sii nibi.
They were made of wood.	Igi ni won fi da won.
I did my best.	Mo ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
I don’t work with it.	Emi ko ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
They should be well.	Wọn daradara yẹ ki o jẹ.
If a person wants to die, there is probably a reason.	Ti eniyan ba fẹ ki o ku, o ṣee ṣe idi kan.
Of course, fathers do not count.	Dajudaju, awọn baba ko ka.
And we can work with people.	Ati pe a le ṣiṣẹ pẹlu eniyan.
To get.	Lati gba.
In the end, the end.	Ni ipari, ipari.
Life became very difficult for us.	Igbesi aye di lile pupọ fun wa.
I want to talk to you first.	Mo fẹ lati ba ọ sọrọ ni akọkọ.
We do not have that position here.	A ko ni ipo yẹn nibi.
And if you know us, you know that.	Ati pe ti o ba mọ wa, o mọ iyẹn.
I use this method to.	Mo lo ọna yii si.
Most do not have a family history of the situation.	Pupọ julọ ko ni itan idile ti ipo naa.
If it weren’t for him, he would be yours.	Ti kii ba ṣe fun u, oun yoo jẹ tirẹ.
Just do whatever you feel you have to do.	O kan ṣe ohunkohun ti o ba lero pe o ni lati ṣe.
We are not worried about this.	A ko ni aniyan nipa eyi.
It’s there now, and it works great.	O wa ni bayi, ati pe o ṣiṣẹ nla.
Not, of course, that important, you think.	Kii ṣe, dajudaju, pe o ṣe pataki, o ro.
I think they can.	Mo ro pe wọn le.
Now we do.	Bayi a ṣe.
I got up in my seat.	Mo dide ni ijoko mi.
I know you are.	Mo mọ pe o wa.
If they have, ask how much.	Ti wọn ba ni, beere melo.
He grabbed the back of my head and pulled me towards him.	O di ẹhin ori mi mu o si fa mi si ọdọ rẹ.
No one died at that time.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ku ni akoko yẹn.
They weren’t just there to see him.	Wọn ko wa nibẹ nikan lati wo i.
It's too late.	O ti pẹ.
But lately people have come.	Ṣugbọn laipẹ awọn eniyan ti wa.
You can't know what happened to the boy.	O ko le mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si ọmọkunrin naa.
It doesn’t matter to him if they are human or not.	Ko ṣe pataki fun u ti wọn ba jẹ eniyan tabi kii ṣe.
A day or two, that’s all.	Ọjọ kan tabi meji, iyẹn ni gbogbo rẹ.
That, at least, is true.	Iyẹn, o kere ju, jẹ otitọ.
It is an instrument used in music.	O jẹ ohun elo ti a lo ninu orin.
Okay, it’s that way right now.	O dara, o jẹ ọna yẹn ni bayi.
We don’t even need a car to reach them.	A ko paapaa nilo ọkọ lati de ọdọ wọn.
Make it your own.	Ṣe fun tirẹ si ọ.
We don't just want them out of here.	A ko kan fẹ wọn jade ti nibi.
Maybe one is true.	Boya ọkan jẹ otitọ.
But once we got on the boat, it was fine.	Ṣugbọn ni kete ti a ba de inu ọkọ oju omi, o dara.
That didn't last long.	Iyẹn ko pẹ pupọ.
If money is not a problem,	Ti owo ko ba ni iṣoro,
He would love to hear all our news.	Oun yoo fẹ lati gbọ gbogbo awọn iroyin wa.
You have never had a happy life.	O ti ko ni kan dun aye.
It should not be too hard.	Ko yẹ ki o jẹ lile pupọ.
Just not good enough for them.	O kan ko dara to fun wọn.
But it’s not that simple.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe pe o rọrun.
I go see them every summer.	Mo lọ wo wọn ni gbogbo igba ooru kan.
Think about what you want.	Ronu nipa ohun ti o fẹ.
I want it out.	Mo fẹ ki o jade.
He is very similar.	O si jẹ gidigidi iru.
But he did not think about it.	Ṣugbọn o ko ronu nipa rẹ.
I do not know how to say.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe le sọ.
My own.	Ti ara mi.
I think people deserve to try it.	Mo ro pe eniyan yẹ lati gbiyanju o.
Before the year ended.	Ṣaaju ki ọdun to pari.
No, it will not last very long.	Ko ṣe bẹ, ko ni fun igba pipẹ pupọ.
I too have changed.	Emi naa ti yipada.
Some very obvious.	Diẹ ninu awọn han gidigidi.
However, there are several explanations for this.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn alaye pupọ wa fun eyi.
People have talked about it.	Awọn eniyan ti sọrọ nipa rẹ.
I still feel that way.	Mo tun lero bẹ.
I don’t know why he wouldn’t use his name.	Emi ko mọ idi ti ko ni lo orukọ rẹ.
It is not that it is difficult to understand.	Kii ṣe pe o nira lati ni oye.
I know how it makes you feel.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe jẹ ki o lero.
I only use it all the time for a while.	Mo lo nikan ni gbogbo igba ni igba diẹ.
You wear whatever you want.	O wọ ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
Not that many, as it turns out.	Ko ti ọpọlọpọ awọn, bi o ti wa ni jade.
It should not be used.	O yẹ ki o ko lo.
No, that's not it.	Rara, kii ṣe iyẹn.
You can see why.	O ti le ri idi.
I wonder how they got the report.	Mo ṣe iyalẹnu bawo ni wọn ṣe gba iroyin naa.
And that’s no small feat.	Ati pe iyẹn kii ṣe nkan kekere.
That's really why they won.	Ti o ni gan idi ti won gba.
But let me tell you, it was good.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki n sọ fun ọ, o dara julọ.
Early on, someone died working in our office.	Ni kutukutu, ẹnikan ku ti o ṣiṣẹ ni ọfiisi wa.
I will kill them or they will kill me.	Emi yoo pa wọn tabi wọn yoo pa mi.
Nothing was cut.	Ko si ohun ti a ge.
I told them to make sure.	Mo sọ fun wọn lati rii daju.
Know what you get.	Mọ ohun ti o gba ni.
Maybe we didn't pay enough attention.	Boya a ko san akiyesi to.
That's how we see it.	Bi a ṣe rii niyẹn.
Our money is not worth it at all.	Owo wa ko tọ rara.
We are working as a team here.	A n ṣiṣẹ bi ẹgbẹ kan nibi.
And that’s important.	Ati pe iyẹn ṣe pataki.
Which makes me think of another missed opportunity.	Eyi ti o jẹ ki n ronu ti anfani miiran ti o padanu.
You know a lot of people.	O mọ ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan.
They arrived at her house, but happy.	Wọn de ile ti rẹ, ṣugbọn dun.
I shouldn’t be wondering if you can laugh about it with me right now.	Emi ko yẹ ki o ṣe iyalẹnu boya o le rẹrin nipa rẹ pẹlu mi ni bayi.
Most of them come from the original idea.	Ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn wa lati ero akọkọ.
The world returns to the same place as before.	Aye pada si ibi kanna bi tẹlẹ.
That is my bad.	Iyẹn jẹ buburu mi.
Or maybe it is the wrong question.	Tabi boya o jẹ ti ko tọ si ibeere.
I never play that song again.	Emi ko tun ṣe orin yẹn mọ.
Water is everywhere.	Omi wa ni ibi gbogbo.
I will be leaving the office today.	Emi yoo jade kuro ni ọfiisi loni.
We are having a wonderful time.	A n ni akoko iyanu.
He took this very seriously on the edge.	O mu eyi gaan lori eti.
No one should buy this.	Ko si ẹniti o yẹ ki o ra eyi.
That is very good news.	Iyẹn jẹ iroyin ti o dara pupọ.
I would take that very seriously.	Emi yoo gba iyẹn pupọ.
Accept, accept.	Gba, gba.
Have some breakfast, talk to the boys.	Ṣe ounjẹ owurọ diẹ, ba awọn ọmọkunrin sọrọ.
Some, it seems, continue forever.	Diẹ ninu, o dabi pe, tẹsiwaju lailai.
They will not hurt him.	Wọn kii yoo ṣe ipalara fun u.
And he did.	Ati pe o ṣe.
It is removed from the machine tools by this technology.	O kuro ni awọn ẹrọ ẹrọ nipasẹ ọna ẹrọ yii.
The problem is that most stores do not carry them.	Iṣoro naa ni pe ọpọlọpọ awọn ile itaja ko gbe wọn.
Just myself.	O kan ara mi.
My old school friend.	Ọrẹ ile-iwe atijọ ti mi.
This has to be wrong.	Eyi ni lati jẹ aṣiṣe.
Do not be angry with him.	Maṣe binu fun u.
They can carry them in their hands.	Wọn le gbe wọn si ọwọ wọn.
They don’t seem to be afraid.	Wọn ko dabi pe o bẹru.
It’s about chance.	O jẹ nipa anfani.
We see them all around.	A ri wọn ni ayika pupọ.
It takes about an hour.	O gba to wakati kan.
They have to love it.	Wọn ni lati fẹran rẹ.
It just can't help it. 	O kan ko le ran o. 
They came back and took my garden.	Wọn ti pada wa ti wọn gba ọgba mi.
Stories pass from mother to daughter.	Awọn itan kọja lati iya si ọmọbirin.
Three test items were used.	Awọn nkan idanwo mẹta lo.
But they have values.	Ṣugbọn wọn ni awọn iye.
But it is also rewarding.	Sugbon o tun ṣe ere.
I'll be back .	Emi yoo pada .
You have to look at this.	O ni lati wo eyi.
I have introduced myself to your friend.	Mo ti fi ara mi han ọrẹ rẹ.
Someone is watching them.	Ẹnikan n wo wọn.
He was convinced.	O ti ni idaniloju.
The new city looks to the future, not to the past.	Ilu tuntun naa wo ọjọ iwaju, kii ṣe si ohun ti o ti kọja.
I was just worried about going home.	Mo kan ni aniyan nipa lilọ si ile.
Some students do well.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ṣe daradara.
I drink, you drink, you love it.	Mo mu, o mu, fẹran rẹ.
But most of all, have a plan.	Ṣugbọn julọ julọ, ni eto kan.
The story is based on a true story.	Itan naa da lori itan otitọ.
Nothing is ever right, and nothing is enough.	Ko si ohun ti o tọ lailai, ati pe ko si ohun ti o to.
This does not feel like home.	Eyi ko lero bi ile.
Okay, tell you the truth, he's as good as he is.	O dara, sọ otitọ fun ọ, o dara bi oun.
This will help a lot.	Eyi yoo ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
If you sell now.	Ti o ba ta bayi.
Nothing before it has changed.	Ko si ohun ṣaaju ki o to rẹ ti yi pada.
All the time.	Ni gbogbo igba.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	O wo bi o ti ya.
This book is really interesting.	Iwe yi jẹ gan awon.
It’s just important that you can do something with them.	O kan pataki ti o le se nkankan pẹlu wọn.
That's how it is.	Bi o ti ri niyẹn.
They sell themselves.	Wọn ta ara wọn.
I do not have to tell you the details.	Emi ko ni lati sọ awọn alaye naa fun ọ.
Put it all together.	Fi gbogbo eyi papọ.
We will do the same.	A yoo ṣe kanna.
What happened in the past is a thing of the past.	Ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni igba atijọ jẹ ti o ti kọja.
You are born to parents.	O ti wa ni bi lati awọn obi.
You will know better.	Iwọ yoo mọ dara julọ.
Arrival.	Dide.
Two eyes, two ears.	Oju meji, eti meji.
This may not be as obvious as it sounds.	Eyi le ma han gbangba bi o ti n dun.
I love the way it has changed.	Mo nifẹ ọna ti o yipada.
Is the man just that?	Ṣe ọkunrin naa kan pe?
Just say it means.	Kan sọ pe o tumọ si.
.	.
Someone is coming.	Ẹnikan n bọ.
They tell me this all the time.	Wọn sọ eyi fun mi ni gbogbo igba.
Find one of the girls you used to.	Wa ọkan ninu awọn ọmọbirin ti o lo lati.
He did not think they were dead but they remained.	Ko ro pe wọn ti ku ṣugbọn wọn wa silẹ.
I do not know whether to hope or not.	Emi ko mọ boya lati nireti tabi rara.
You have to find for yourself to believe.	O ni lati rii fun ararẹ lati gbagbọ.
Good people, too.	Awọn eniyan dara, paapaa.
I think it deserves more.	Mo ro pe o yẹ diẹ sii.
I told myself that.	Mo ti sọ fun ara mi pe.
Or at least just as much.	Tabi ni tabi o kere kan bi Elo.
Everyone else is gone.	Gbogbo eniyan miiran ti lọ.
They are easy to find.	Wọn rọrun lati wa.
However, errors can arise from time to time.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn aṣiṣe le dide lati igba de igba.
We have money to do.	A ni owo lati ṣe.
Must take me to bed.	Gbọdọ mu mi lọ si ibusun.
River let down.	Odo jẹ ki awọn isalẹ.
I believe they love me.	Mo gbagbọ pe wọn nifẹ mi.
Broken head.	Ori ti a fọ.
They can play football and do a good job.	Wọn le ṣe bọọlu ati ṣe iṣẹ to dara.
The two words will never go out of him.	Awọn ọrọ meji naa ko ni lọ lati inu rẹ.
Would not have known we touched because he was asleep.	Yoo ko ti mọ ti a fi ọwọ nitori o ti sun.
Why not ask for your help?	Kilode ti a ko beere fun iranlọwọ rẹ?
There is also an opportunity for you.	Anfani tun wa fun ọ.
They know that everyone wants more understanding.	Wọn mọ pe gbogbo eniyan fẹ oye diẹ.
Carry.	Gbe.
By that time, the song was over.	Ni akoko yẹn, orin naa ti pari.
He was a boy.	O jẹ ọmọkunrin kan.
I know a little.	Mo ti mọ diẹ.
I do not see that to be true.	Emi ko rii pe iyẹn jẹ otitọ.
My parents were not sent.	Won ko awon obi mi lo.
Wait for the meal.	Duro fun ounjẹ naa.
But he also did not know how to tell his story to her.	Ṣugbọn ko tun mọ bi o ṣe le sọ iroyin rẹ fun u.
The sister was not warm to the idea.	Arabinrin naa ko gbona si imọran naa.
Your head is not there.	Ori re ko si.
This is great news.	Eyi jẹ iroyin nla.
Others say no.	Awọn miiran sọ rara.
Tell everyone you meet.	Sọ fun gbogbo eniyan ti o ba pade.
I don't have much water.	Emi ko ni omi pupọ.
There is nothing you can write there.	Ko si ohun ti o le kọ nibẹ.
It has never been easier to remove.	Ko ti rọrun lati yọ kuro.
This is hard to understand.	Eleyi jẹ gidigidi lati ni oye.
I will wait, he said.	Emi yoo duro, o sọ.
Possibly too.	O ṣee ṣe ju.
I am hungry.	Ebi re mo mi.
Do not drink and drive!	Maṣe mu ati wakọ!
I need to feel it.	Mo nilo lati lero rẹ.
Time is not yet on.	Akoko ko tii da duro.
So he did not come.	Nitorina o ko wa.
I was happy, but did not know me.	Inu mi dun, ṣugbọn ko mọ mi.
Got some bad news.	Ni diẹ ninu awọn iroyin buburu.
Don’t try to be something you are not.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati jẹ nkan ti iwọ kii ṣe.
You can not change what happened.	O ko le yi ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
This is where the game begins.	Eyi ni aaye ti ere bẹrẹ.
Not the best music ever, in my opinion.	Kii ṣe orin ti o dara julọ lailai, ni ero mi.
Just to touch him.	Nikan lati fi ọwọ rẹ fun u.
There are many places like this.	Nibẹ ni o wa ọpọlọpọ awọn aaye bi yi.
It stays.	O duro jẹ.
You are always looking for ways to express your thoughts.	O nigbagbogbo n wa awọn ọna lati ro ero rẹ.
You do not have a job.	O ko ni iṣẹ kan.
Of course there is another way.	Dajudaju ọna miiran wa.
This company has more problems than you realize.	Ile-iṣẹ yii ni awọn iṣoro diẹ sii ju ti o mọ.
I see this in many ways as the same thing.	Mo rii eyi ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna bi ohun kanna.
I do not know where I started.	Emi ko mọ ibiti mo ti bẹrẹ.
He didn't even think about that at all.	Ko paapaa ronu nipa iyẹn rara.
How you get back is what matters.	Bi o ṣe gba pada ni ohun ti o ṣe pataki.
Or at least it looks like so far this year.	Tabi o kere ju o dabi pe o tọ titi di ọdun yii.
We know that nothing bad will come of it.	A mọ pe ko si ohun buburu ti yoo wa ninu rẹ.
Think about this carefully.	Ronu nipa eyi daradara.
To get.	Lati mu.
See you do not forget them.	Wo o ko gbagbe wọn.
I turned to go.	Mo yipada lati lọ.
They taught me a lot.	Wọn kọ mi pupọ.
If you have questions for us, please ask them.	Ti o ba ni ibeere fun wa, jọwọ beere wọn.
Both have an agreement.	Awọn mejeeji ni adehun.
My thoughts are my own.	Awọn ero mi jẹ ti ara mi.
You should be able to give practical advice.	O yẹ ki o ni anfani lati fun awọn imọran imọran.
He would believe that.	Oun yoo gbagbọ pe.
Let me ask you.	Jẹ ki n beere lọwọ rẹ.
No one sees it as life.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o rii bi igbesi aye.
We want to hear from you !.	A fẹ gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ!.
Through his eyes.	Nipasẹ oju rẹ.
He got up and walked over to her.	O dide o si rin lori si rẹ.
So why not start today.	Nitorina kilode ti o ko bẹrẹ loni.
Of course, you know this.	Dajudaju, o mọ eyi.
We can't do that yet.	A ko le ṣe iyẹn sibẹsibẹ.
This is where we must begin.	Eyi ni ibi ti a gbọdọ bẹrẹ.
There you are!	Nibẹ o wa!
But there is one thing you do not need to ask me.	Ṣugbọn ohun kan wa ti o ko nilo lati beere lọwọ mi.
But they do not know what to do.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
We did that for our two children but they were very easy.	A ṣe iyẹn si awọn ọmọ wa meji ṣugbọn wọn rọrun pupọ.
That would be two.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ meji.
We all have mistakes and we can’t change that.	Gbogbo wa ni awọn aṣiṣe ati pe a ko le yi iyẹn pada.
They raise the cost of living.	Wọn gbe iye owo igbesi aye soke.
He wants me out of his way.	O fẹ mi kuro ni ọna rẹ.
So we have a point.	Nitorina a ni aaye kan.
I hope to see you soon.	Mo nireti lati ri ọ laipẹ.
It could even be you.	O le paapaa jẹ iwọ.
Just did not read the whole test.	O kan ko ka gbogbo idanwo naa.
I do not mind.	Mo binu.
Make love to your wife.	Ṣe ifẹ si iyawo rẹ.
Please let us know what kind of drink is on your mind.	Jọwọ fun wa ni imọran iru ohun mimu ti o wa ninu ero rẹ.
I think you will be able to again.	Mo ro pe o yoo ni anfani lati lẹẹkansi.
You can do anything and you do that great.	O le ṣe ohunkohun ati pe o ṣe nla yẹn.
Out of this world.	Ti jade ninu aye yi.
And that is the way it is.	Ati pe iyẹn ni ọna ti o jẹ.
He will have a future.	Oun yoo ni ojo iwaju.
Nothing appears.	Ko si ohun ti o han.
We should have paid attention.	A yẹ ki o ti san akiyesi.
And he could not return to tell him where the city was.	Ati pe ko le pada lati sọ ibi eyikeyi ti ilu wa fun u.
They have more young people.	Wọn ni awọn ọdọ diẹ sii.
You can understand it, of course.	O le loye rẹ, dajudaju.
We need your help.	A nilo iranlọwọ rẹ.
This is not an easy task.	Eyi kii ṣe iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
It works but not in the right way.	O n ṣiṣẹ ṣugbọn kii ṣe ni ọna ti o tọ.
Anything is going on.	Ohunkohun ti wa ni ti lọ lori.
We just know who the other person is.	A kan mọ ẹni ti eniyan miiran jẹ.
Which is great because you need to stop this story.	Eyi ti o jẹ nla nitori o nilo lati da itan yii silẹ.
It really reached him.	O de ọdọ rẹ gaan.
I like the kind of people you used to buy.	Mo fẹran iru awọn eniyan ti o lo lati ra.
No food for two days.	Ko si ounjẹ fun ọjọ meji.
But there is a problem.	Ṣugbọn iṣoro kan wa.
You should leave.	O yẹ ki o lọ kuro.
I heard it.	Mo ti gbọ rẹ.
None of these people claimed to be in this position.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn eniyan wọnyi ti o beere lati wa ni ipo yii.
And it works well.	Ati pe o n ṣiṣẹ daradara.
I want you to think of them carefully.	Mo fẹ ki o ro wọn daradara.
You can't recognize him, but his face is clean.	O ko le da a mọ, ṣugbọn oju rẹ mọ.
Not even a new home.	Ko paapaa ile tuntun.
But when you stop, you can see.	Ṣugbọn nigbati o ba duro, o le rii.
I said you could go.	Mo sọ pe o le lọ.
I learned a lesson there.	Mo ti kọ ẹkọ kan nibẹ.
Some large trees have become very large.	Diẹ ninu awọn igi nla ti di pupọ.
Tell me what it means to you and why.	Sọ fun mi kini o tumọ si fun ọ ati idi.
We want you to enjoy it.	A fẹ ki o wa gbadun rẹ.
You know something is very wrong.	O mọ pe ohun kan jẹ aṣiṣe pupọ.
Little things you don’t even notice.	Awọn nkan kekere ti o ko paapaa ṣe akiyesi.
But without much thought.	Ṣugbọn laisi ero pupọ.
In most cases, this is true.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba, eyi jẹ otitọ.
You do not have time to read.	O ko ni akoko lati ka.
I get that now.	Mo gba iyẹn bayi.
I go out for a party with my friends during the day.	Mo jade lọ fun ayẹyẹ pẹlu awọn ọrẹ mi nigba ọjọ.
My eyes are happy.	Oju mi ​​dun.
We will make sure your dad is okay.	A yoo rii daju pe baba rẹ dara.
Leave yourself a little bit.	Fi ara rẹ silẹ diẹ.
No wonder they are friends.	Ko ṣe iyanu pe wọn jẹ ọrẹ.
The cloth slipped into the fire.	Aṣọ naa yọ sinu ina.
It was a beautiful bag.	O je kan lẹwa apo.
I agree to this.	Mo ti gba si eyi.
Come on, let's move on.	Wa, jẹ ki a tẹsiwaju.
They drink a lot.	Wọn mu pupọ.
Talked about your problems.	Ti sọrọ nipa awọn iṣoro rẹ.
We don’t know how to do so many things anymore.	A ko mọ bi a ṣe le ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan mọ.
This city is very beautiful.	Ilu yi lẹwa pupọ.
People love this place.	Eniyan nifẹ ibi yii.
I don’t want to record what you say or do.	Emi ko fẹ lati kọ silẹ ohun ti o sọ tabi ṣe.
Maybe they are like us.	Boya wọn dabi wa.
Get it with a front light.	Gba pẹlu ina iwaju kan.
Not the cost but the cost of living.	Kii ṣe iye owo ṣugbọn iye igbesi aye.
Water is essential for the whole world.	Omi jẹ pataki fun gbogbo aye.
You do not have to meet him.	O ko ni lati pade rẹ.
This will be harder than you think.	Eyi yoo le ju bi o ti ro lọ.
Not so much, it turns out.	Ko ki Elo, o wa ni jade.
The best music is what we use.	Awọn orin ti o dara julọ jẹ ohun ti a lo.
Maybe this is the place to ask my question.	Boya eyi ni aaye lati beere ibeere mi.
We will do everything as one.	A yoo ṣe ohun gbogbo bi ọkan.
This can be done in many ways.	Eyi le ṣee ṣe ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna.
I would like to know what you think about it.	Emi yoo fẹ lati mọ kini o ro nipa rẹ.
Sometimes this is very difficult.	Nigba miiran eyi nira pupọ.
She felt so good.	O ro ki o dara.
And it’s on your phone.	Ati pe o wa lori foonu rẹ.
He loves it.	O nifẹ rẹ.
He ate every three hours.	O jẹun ni gbogbo wakati mẹta.
No they do not.	Rara wọn ko ṣe.
One could not see that moment.	Eniyan kan ko le rii akoko yẹn.
Do your parents know where you are?	Njẹ awọn obi rẹ mọ ibi ti o wa?
I had to learn how to do that.	Mo ni lati kọ bi mo ṣe le ṣe iyẹn.
When you are married.	Nigba ti o wa ni iyawo.
And the most probable one.	Ati ọkan ti o ṣeeṣe julọ.
This is not on them.	Eyi kii ṣe lori wọn.
For a long time.	Fun igba pipẹ.
For he is a man who can understand.	Fun o jẹ ọkunrin kan ti o le ni oye.
Kind of.	Bi i.
I just got a drink.	Mo kan gba ohun mimu.
She is just starting to get to my husband.	O ti n bẹrẹ gaan lati de ọdọ ọkọ mi.
Fresh bread.	Akara tuntun.
Police decided this was not an accident.	Ọlọpa pinnu pe eyi kii ṣe ijamba.
Let me write this down.	Jẹ ki n kọ eyi silẹ.
It looks good.	O dabi pe o dara.
I heard it.	Mo gbọ rẹ.
I'm glad you don't live in this city right now, dad.	Inu mi dun pe o ko gbe ni ilu yii ni bayi, baba.
This is a simple task.	Eyi jẹ iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
We are on top.	A wa lori oke.
Let it do.	Jẹ ki o ṣe.
It may be okay, but you don't want it to go away.	O ṣee ṣe dara, ṣugbọn ko fẹ ki o lọ.
They enjoy their own company.	Wọn gbadun ile-iṣẹ ara wọn.
However, he did not come back.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko pada wa.
Three children live in the house.	Awọn ọmọde mẹta ti ngbe ni ile naa.
You either are not here or you are and you are gone.	O boya ko si nibi tabi o ti wa ati pe o ti lọ.
I know what you like.	Mo mọ ohun ti o feran.
With anyone there can not go.	Pẹlu ẹnikẹni nibẹ ko le lọ.
I do not want to be.	Emi ko fẹ lati jẹ.
There is no vehicle outside.	Ko si ọkọ ni ita.
I stand like that.	Mo duro bi iyẹn.
A little boy.	Ọmọkunrin kekere kan.
It's something that gives a person reason to worry.	O ni nkan ti yoo fun eniyan ni idi lati ṣe aniyan.
But it is very good.	Ṣugbọn o dara pupọ.
Some children will not.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọ yoo ko.
Sure you like it.	O daju pe o fẹran rẹ.
To be sure, this is much easier said than done.	Lati rii daju, eyi rọrun pupọ lati sọ ju ṣiṣe lọ.
However, these are good.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn wọnyi dara.
I deserved something.	Mo ti yẹ nkankan.
This is not the case.	Eyi kii ṣe bẹ.
He was forced to move.	O ti fi agbara mu lati gbe.
Not enough kids.	Ko to yara.
All the while, just in case.	Ni gbogbo igba, o kan ni akoko kan.
I carry two boxes.	Mo gbe apoti meji.
It was also their big day.	O tun jẹ ọjọ nla wọn.
But there is more to consider here.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii wa lati ronu nibi.
You are in the wrong place at the wrong time.	O wa ni ibi ti ko tọ ni akoko ti ko tọ.
I am looking for other ways.	Mo wa awọn ọna miiran.
He told me that.	O so fun mi pe.
When you open them again, nothing changes.	Nigbati o ṣi wọn lẹẹkansi, ko si ohun ti o yipada.
Not that he ever did.	Ko ti o lailai ṣe.
They were robbed of their money.	Owo ni won fi ji won gbe.
It keeps him out of trouble.	O n pa a mọ kuro ninu wahala.
They will wait for that.	Wọn yoo duro de iyẹn.
It came to my name.	O wa si orukọ mi.
I do not accept them.	Emi ko gba wọn.
Get your children involved too.	Gba awọn ọmọ rẹ lọwọ pẹlu.
I sat for a while.	Mo joko fun igba diẹ.
I want more of that.	Mo fẹ diẹ sii ti iyẹn.
They need the money.	Wọn nilo owo naa.
Here, he writes it down.	Nibi, o kọ ọ si isalẹ.
And they did not see.	Ati pe wọn ko rii.
I returned it to him.	Mo da a pada fun u.
And they do it every day.	Ati pe wọn ṣe ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Dad looked at the wrong place.	Baba wo ibi ti ko dara.
But it is so.	Sugbon o jẹ bẹ.
It lets you go in an unpleasant way.	O jẹ ki o lọ ni ọna ti ko dun.
They just mean to start again and with it.	Wọn tumọ nikan lati bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi ati pẹlu rẹ.
He doesn’t know how to get it back.	Ko mọ bi o ṣe le gba pada.
You have removed it.	O ti yọ ọ kuro.
If you like it, great.	Ti o ba fẹran rẹ, nla.
He was there in two minutes.	O wa nibẹ ni iṣẹju meji.
Hot weather, if not hot.	Awọn ojo gbona, ti ko ba gbona.
I take time every day to do.	Mo gba akoko ni gbogbo ọjọ lati ṣe.
And we have to continue.	Ati pe a ni lati tẹsiwaju.
But better than ever.	Ṣugbọn dara pẹ ju rara.
We have seen it in other worlds.	A ti rii ni awọn aye miiran.
Iron, that is the highest industry.	Irin, iyẹn ni ile-iṣẹ ti o ga julọ.
You should not have a class available.	Ko yẹ ki o ni kilasi kan ti o wa.
Not until we get home.	Ko titi a fi de ile.
I have to call.	Mo ni lati pe.
He said it needs to be a space with good potential.	O sọ pe o nilo lati jẹ aaye ti o ni agbara to dara.
I stand on the field.	Mo duro lori aaye.
Get inside yourself.	Wọ inu ara rẹ.
Everyone is standing around.	Gbogbo eniyan n duro ni ayika.
I do not understand why it is not.	Emi ko loye idi ti kii ṣe.
But there you go.	Ṣugbọn nibẹ ti o lọ.
They don’t know how to do things here.	Wọn ko mọ bi a ṣe ṣe awọn nkan nibi.
She almost knew the man.	O fẹrẹ mọ ọkunrin naa.
But this is important.	Ṣugbọn eyi ṣe pataki.
There is no power to his work.	Ko si agbara si iṣẹ rẹ.
Another word for tonight seems to be on them.	Ọrọ miiran fun alẹ oni dabi ẹni pe o wa lori wọn.
But there is no time for that.	Ṣugbọn ko si akoko fun iyẹn.
When he returned home.	Nigbati o ti pada si ile kẹhin.
I have to talk to you.	Mo gbọdọ sọrọ si rẹ.
My reason is based on my interests over both.	Idi mi da lori awọn anfani mi lori awọn mejeeji.
Most of them are through me.	Pupọ julọ wọn wa nipasẹ mi.
Taken up.	Ti mu soke.
Back to start.	Pada lati bẹrẹ.
But truth is everywhere and it is everything.	Ṣugbọn otitọ wa nibi gbogbo ati pe o jẹ ohun gbogbo.
You have done this kind of thing all your life.	O ti ṣe iru nkan bayi ni gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ.
Not how they work, but how they can work.	Kii ṣe bi wọn ṣe n ṣiṣẹ, ṣugbọn bi wọn ṣe le ṣiṣẹ.
And no, it doesn’t work the other way around.	Ati pe rara, ko ṣiṣẹ ni ọna miiran.
My husband.	Ọkọ mi.
Like this special day.	Bi ọjọ pataki yii.
A few more weeks away from injury can only help.	Ọsẹ kan diẹ sii ti a yọ kuro ninu ipalara le ṣe iranlọwọ nikan.
Everything that will die will be.	Gbogbo ohun ti yoo ku yoo jẹ.
But something must happen.	Sugbon nkankan gbọdọ ṣẹlẹ.
I just picked it up and tried it out.	Mo ti o kan gbe o si gbiyanju o jade.
Others do a lot of it.	Awọn miiran ṣe pupọ julọ ninu rẹ.
They are also in the city center.	Wọn tun wa ni ilu ilu.
Let's get started.	Jẹ ki a bẹrẹ.
Strength for a bad face.	Okun fun oju ti ko dara.
This work happens before and after the law.	Iṣẹ yii ṣẹlẹ ṣaaju ati lẹhin ofin naa.
Look and see.	Wo ki o si ri.
I mean, of course it does.	Mo tumọ si, dajudaju o ṣe ni idi.
I remember the good old days.	Mo ranti awọn ti o dara atijọ ọjọ.
I have to drop something.	Mo ni lati fi nkankan silẹ.
We have enough money for the trip now.	A ni owo ti o to fun irin-ajo naa ni bayi.
I love dogs.	Mo nifẹ awọn aja.
I think everyone knows that.	Mo ro pe gbogbo eniyan lo mọ iyẹn.
Maybe there is another reason.	Boya idi miiran wa.
He also stopped.	O tun duro.
Some of them.	Diẹ ninu wọn.
It is full of love.	O kun fun ife.
But that is good.	Sugbon ohun to dara niyen.
So he let us eat.	Nitorina o jẹ ki a jẹ.
No time to meet anyone else.	Ko si akoko lati pade ẹnikẹni miiran.
It was amazing to have this good feeling.	O jẹ iyalẹnu lati ni rilara ti o dara yii.
He fears they will change again.	O bẹru pe wọn yoo yipada lẹẹkansi.
He never wrote back.	Ko kọ pada rara.
The child cannot keep his eyes open.	Ọmọ naa ko le jẹ ki oju rẹ ṣii.
But the sun was nothing to him.	Ṣugbọn oorun ko jẹ nkankan fun u.
The work was completed on time.	Iṣẹ naa ti pari ni akoko.
It would have been more surprising if it had.	Yoo ti jẹ iyalẹnu julọ ti o ba jẹ.
We cannot forget that.	A ko le gbagbe pe.
Anyone who knows me, ask any of our players.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ba mọ mi, beere eyikeyi ninu awọn ẹrọ orin wa.
Small system errors cause a lot of problems.	Awọn aṣiṣe eto kekere fa ọpọlọpọ awọn iṣoro.
I do not agree with them.	Emi ko gba pẹlu wọn.
Go, it’s just your life.	Lọ, o jẹ aye rẹ nikan.
Three men went up.	Awọn ọkunrin mẹta lọ soke.
The significance of this observation is uncertain.	Pataki akiyesi yii ko ni idaniloju.
Get a book.	Gba iwe iwe.
We are good friends.	A jẹ ọrẹ to dara.
Or you feel fast.	Tabi o n rilara ti o yara.
It may not be good for him.	O le ma dara fun u.
We talk less.	A sọrọ kere.
There should be no place.	Ko si ibiti o yẹ ki o wa.
You know why not.	O mọ idi ti ko ni.
I find myself doing the same thing.	Mo ri ara mi n ṣe ohun kanna.
They find a way.	Wọn wa ọna kan.
That's easy.	Iyẹn rọrun.
Just want to talk.	O kan fẹ lati sọrọ.
You can't leave him, or her for that matter, out there.	O ko le fi i, tabi rẹ fun ti ọrọ, jade nibẹ.
It is probably there now.	O ṣee ṣe pe o wa nibẹ ni bayi.
I think you have put up on that.	Mo ro pe o ti fi soke lori wipe.
You must have received your doctor's degree.	O gbọdọ ti gba oye dokita rẹ.
He looked at her face again.	O tun wo oju rẹ lẹẹkansi.
I'll make a seat for you.	Emi yoo ṣe ijoko ijoko fun ọ.
Maybe you can also help them?	Boya o tun le ran wọn lọwọ?
It was hard to see much outside.	O jẹ gidigidi lati ri pupọ ni ita.
Make sure.	Rii daju pupọ.
All buildings are in good condition.	Gbogbo awọn ile wa ni ipo ti o dara.
We need to know what is going on around us.	A yẹ lati mọ ohun ti o wa ni ayika wa.
Last night he added my houses.	Ni alẹ ana o fi awọn ile mi kun.
He loves them.	O fẹran wọn.
He reached for the door, but hesitated.	O de ọwọ ilẹkun, ṣugbọn ṣiyemeji.
Both loved the idea and worked well together.	Awọn mejeeji fẹran imọran naa ati pe a ṣiṣẹ daradara papọ.
It should be written for us.	O yẹ ki a kọ fun wa.
I walk every day.	Mo rin ni gbogbo ọjọ.
I cut that out of my life.	Mo ge iyẹn kuro ninu igbesi aye mi.
They are also in bed.	Wọn tun wa lori ibusun.
They should not laugh.	Wọn ko yẹ ki wọn rẹrin.
You never asked for it.	O ko beere fun u rara.
I did something he never did.	Mo ṣe ohun ti ko ṣe rara.
Just go see what you need.	Kan lọ wo ohun ti o nilo.
This, however, is only a suggestion.	Eyi, sibẹsibẹ, jẹ imọran nikan.
Them.	Awon.
Take this letter with you.	Mu lẹta yii pẹlu rẹ.
Today, that is.	Loni, iyẹn ni.
That’s all we said.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo ohun ti a sọ.
They have all kinds.	Won ni gbogbo iru.
Don't try to understand, just play the game.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati ni oye, o kan mu ere naa.
I try to eat.	Mo gbiyanju lati jẹ.
This makes it better.	Eyi jẹ ki o dara.
It can be good.	O le dara.
Not so good.	Ko dara bẹ.
Try them on a clean baby.	Gbiyanju wọn lori ọmọ ti o mọ.
Known for nothing, by no one, ever.	Ti a mọ fun ohunkohun, nipasẹ ko si ẹnikan, lailai.
They can’t see me if they try.	Wọn ko le ri mi ti wọn ba gbiyanju.
What a problem no.	Kini iṣoro ko si.
Or whatever it is.	Tabi ohunkohun ti o jẹ.
But this time, his life felt right.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yii, igbesi aye rẹ ro pe o tọ.
Give it to everyone, right now.	Fi fun gbogbo eniyan, ni bayi.
My brother is on the phone.	Arakunrin mi wa lori foonu.
I need to do this for myself.	Mo nilo lati ṣe eyi fun mi.
Neither is love.	Bẹni ifẹ ni.
Boots are very important on the trip.	Awọn bata bata jẹ pataki pupọ lori irin-ajo.
Run as fast and as you can.	Ṣiṣe bi sare ati bi o ti le.
And they did them.	Ati pe wọn ṣe wọn.
They have not had the right opportunity.	Wọn ko ti ni anfani ti o tọ.
Just a thought.	O kan ero.
He called you.	O pe e.
He will learn about the little world he saw there.	Oun yoo kọ nipa aye kekere ti o rii nibẹ.
Food always seems to taste better at home.	Ounjẹ nigbagbogbo dabi pe o dun dara julọ ni ile.
He did this for a reason.	O ṣe eyi ni idi.
I will find a way.	Emi yoo wa ọna kan.
I am looking for something.	Mo n wa nkankan.
It wasn't a lot of money, but it was back then.	O je ko kan pupo ti owo, sugbon o je pada ki o si.
Anything is because you want them there.	Ohunkohun jẹ nitori ti o fẹ wọn nibẹ.
I didn’t notice it, but for the conditions, it was completely possible.	Emi ko ṣe akiyesi rẹ, ṣugbọn fun awọn ipo, o ṣee ṣe patapata.
However, it is not beautiful.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe lẹwa.
We have all done a pretty good job of it.	A ti gbogbo ṣe kan lẹwa ti o dara ise ti o.
He stood on the edge.	O duro ni eti.
It went down not for long.	O lọ si isalẹ ko fun gun.
The sun was on his face.	Oorun wà si oju rẹ.
Or move.	Tabi o gbe.
However few did.	Sibẹsibẹ diẹ ṣe.
But it still has its place.	Ṣugbọn o tun ni aaye rẹ.
That never happened and could not.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ rara ati pe ko le.
Three years of marriage.	Ọdun mẹta ti igbeyawo.
Only bad games.	Nikan buburu awọn ere.
He sat at the table.	O joko ni tabili.
I have this box in my room.	Mo ni apoti yii ninu yara mi.
But no one knows what to do with it.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ kini lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
So it will be fast.	Nitorina yoo yara yara.
This is the best time.	Eyi ni nigbati o dara julọ.
The hour weighed like many other hours.	Wakati naa ti wọn bi ọpọlọpọ awọn wakati miiran.
Your money is gone.	Owo rẹ ti lọ.
Just leave people alone.	Kan fi eniyan silẹ nikan.
Does this site make you happy?	Ṣe aaye yii jẹ ki o dun ọ bi?
The baby was finished before seeing the doctor.	Ọmọ naa ti pari ṣaaju ki o to ri dokita.
It’s time to get back on track.	O to akoko lati pada si ọna.
That includes.	Ti o ni ninu.
They have not seen me yet.	Wọn ko tii wa ri mi sibẹsibẹ.
Go into the room and sit at the table.	Lọ sinu yara ki o si joko ni tabili.
No two people can be accepted.	Ko si eniyan meji le ṣee gba.
I don’t even know what that is.	Emi ko paapaa mọ kini iyẹn jẹ.
We are not the law.	A kii ṣe ofin.
He doesn't like it.	Ko feran re.
He did not change his mind.	Ko yi ori pada.
And it is completely over now.	Ati pe o ti pari patapata ni bayi.
Term.	Igba.
Nothing went as planned.	Ko si ohun ti o lọ bi a ti pinnu.
Nothing will make me stay here.	Ko si ohun ti yoo jẹ ki n duro nibi.
The man cut it.	Ọkunrin naa ge e.
And children need more of it.	Ati awọn ọmọde nilo diẹ sii ti o.
But only for a while.	Sugbon nikan fun akoko kan.
My uncle bought a car last year.	Arakunrin baba mi ra ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan ni ọdun to kọja.
As soon as the police asked him.	Ni kete ti awọn ọlọpa beere lọwọ rẹ.
But we did not find one.	Ṣugbọn a ko ri ọkan.
I tell you in advance.	Mo sọ fun ọ ni iwaju.
One day he died.	Ni ojo kan o ku.
But he did not want to spend time with another woman.	Ṣugbọn ko fẹ lati lo akoko pẹlu obinrin miiran.
Do them.	Ṣe wọn.
To eat is to live.	Lati je ni lati gbe.
He would go to his room.	Oun yoo lọ si yara rẹ.
I want you to look at me.	Mo fe ki o wo mi.
Let's look at this point.	Jẹ ki a wo aaye yii.
Maybe you should.	Boya o yẹ.
That means more to me.	Eyi tumọ si diẹ si mi.
It is a test of an error condition.	O jẹ idanwo ipo aṣiṣe kan.
But it will not be yet.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo jẹ ṣi.
He can not agree on his own terms.	Ko le gba lori awọn ofin tirẹ.
Maybe you will know.	Boya o yoo mọ.
Questions to see it.	Awọn ibeere lati ri i.
Now, you know.	Bayi, o mọ.
Is it okay to wear these shoes out?	Ṣe o dara lati wọ awọn bata wọnyi jade?
It does not help.	Ko ṣe iranlọwọ.
No one can give up their position in life.	Ko si ọkan ti o le fi silẹ si ipo wọn ni igbesi aye.
He was very open and wanted to talk to us.	O ṣii pupọ o si fẹ lati ba wa sọrọ.
The world has changed.	Aye ti yipada.
Applications must come together.	Awọn ohun elo gbọdọ wa papọ.
Or think the law.	Tabi ro ofin.
Not a good thing.	Kii ṣe nkan ti o dara.
I'm glad it's good.	Inu mi dun pe o dara.
Do not say die.	Maṣe sọ pe ku.
Without it, none of us would survive.	Laisi rẹ, ko si ọkan ninu wa ti yoo wa laaye.
I want to get out of here.	Mo fẹ lati jade ni ibi.
Just standing there does nothing.	O kan duro nibẹ ko ṣe nkankan.
With others, however.	Pẹlu awọn miiran, sibẹsibẹ.
And even my children.	Ati awọn ọmọ mi paapaa.
I give you the ones you need.	Mo fun ọ ni awọn ti o nilo.
He never told me about it.	Ko sọ fun mi nipa rẹ rara.
All you know is that something important happened without you.	Gbogbo ohun ti o mọ ni pe ohun pataki kan ṣẹlẹ laisi rẹ.
I got it from one of the new clothing ideas.	Mo gba lati ọkan ninu awọn imọran aṣọ tuntun.
I am not sure what is happening to you.	Emi ko daju ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ fun ọ.
The day did not go well.	Ọjọ naa ko lọ daradara.
I can't let you go home.	Emi ko le jẹ ki o lọ si ile.
For now, at least.	Fun bayi, o kere ju.
In fact there was a good chance he was not coming back.	Ni o daju nibẹ wà kan ti o dara anfani ti o ti ko bọ pada.
No, you have to wait.	Rara, o ni lati duro.
I know they will run.	Mo mọ pe wọn yoo ṣiṣe.
We will not have teachers to teach it.	A ko ni ni awọn olukọ lati kọ ọ.
He is a doctor.	O jẹ dokita.
Long-term rules must be taken into account.	Awọn ofin igba pipẹ gbọdọ wa ni akiyesi.
You can see the girl.	O le ri ọmọbirin naa.
It sounds like everyone's music.	O dabi orin gbogbo eniyan.
I have had it for about a year now.	Mo ti ni o fun bi odun kan bayi.
Take a walk through the city.	Ya kan rin nipasẹ awọn ilu.
People can visit the house and see for themselves.	Awọn eniyan le ṣabẹwo si ile naa ki wọn rii fun ara wọn.
They, of course, have no say in the matter.	Wọn, dajudaju, ko ni ọrọ ninu ọrọ naa.
That is life, you see.	Iyẹn ni igbesi aye, o rii.
So there are many others.	Nitorina ni ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran.
This place is amazing.	Ibi yi je iyanu.
I definitely need help in that area !.	Mo dajudaju nilo iranlọwọ ni agbegbe yẹn!.
He knew he could not stand it anymore.	O mọ pe ko le duro mọ.
Our boys know how to talk to a man.	Awọn ọmọkunrin wa mọ bi a ṣe le ba ọkunrin sọrọ.
Suitable for home and school.	Dara fun ile ati ile-iwe.
Go up first and turn off the light.	Lọ soke ni akọkọ ki o si pa ina.
I can't get any now.	Nko le gba eyikeyi bayi.
You are.	Iwọ ni.
She was laughing into her food and lost her mouth.	O n rẹrin sinu ounjẹ rẹ o si padanu ẹnu rẹ.
You know me very well.	O mọ mi gaan.
I will take you to someone who may know the name.	Emi yoo mu ọ lọ si ọdọ ẹniti o le mọ orukọ naa.
It may be my favorite thing ever.	O le jẹ ohun ayanfẹ mi lailai.
Have you found a place to live yet?	Njẹ o ti rii aye lati gbe sibẹsibẹ?
You don't want to see them now.	O ko fẹ lati wo wọn ni bayi.
We are taught not to do that.	A kọ wa lati ma ṣe iyẹn.
I would eat anything.	Emi yoo jẹ ohunkohun.
This is my life.	Eyi ni igbesi aye mi.
Is not true.	Ṣe kii ṣe otitọ.
I would ask you.	Emi yoo beere lọwọ rẹ.
He doesn't want me to call you.	Ko fe ki n pe e.
It took many years to build.	O gba ọpọlọpọ ọdun lati kọ.
Have a good time with them that night.	Ni akoko ti o dara pẹlu wọn ni alẹ yẹn.
You bought one and I bought one.	O ra ọkan mo si ra ọkan.
Sorry about that.	Ma binu nipa iya rẹ.
And that makes it.	Ati awọn ti o mu ki o.
Listen to it now.	Gbọ rẹ ni bayi.
I tried to read his face.	Mo gbiyanju lati ka oju rẹ.
We can, we must, and we will do better.	A le, a gbọdọ, ati pe a yoo ṣe dara julọ.
He will come back.	Oun yoo pada wa.
I don't want to hear from you.	Emi ko fẹ gbọ ẹnu rẹ.
You will not stay with the vehicle you made.	O ko ni duro pẹlu ọkọ ti o ṣe.
We really appreciate it.	A ṣe akiyesi rẹ gaan.
I need your help.	Mo nilo iranlọwọ rẹ.
Just fun to play with.	O kan fun lati mu ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
Say you know the others are not.	Sọ pe o mọ pe awọn miiran kii ṣe.
Okay, wait.	O dara, duro.
I love that your teachers love my daughter so much.	Mo nifẹ pe awọn olukọ rẹ nifẹ ọmọbirin mi pupọ.
If it is not yet night, wait.	Ti ko ba tii di alẹ, duro.
You should really consider this.	O yẹ ki o ro eyi gaan.
It just tastes good.	O kan dun.
I have only done it a few times.	Mo ti ṣe ni igba diẹ nikan.
This program is nothing new.	Eto yii kii ṣe nkan tuntun.
But what a game it is.	Ṣugbọn kini ere ti o jẹ.
This guy saw this girl at a party.	Arakunrin yii ri ọmọbirin yii ni ibi ayẹyẹ kan.
But if you do, maybe now you will understand me a little more.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba ṣe bẹ, boya ni bayi o yoo loye mi diẹ diẹ sii.
He does not know his name yet.	Ko mọ orukọ rẹ sibẹsibẹ.
He walked away and never returned.	O rin kuro ko pada.
You will never have another world like this.	Iwọ kii yoo ni aye miiran bii eyi.
He had his boat in front of his house.	O ni ọkọ oju omi rẹ ni iwaju ile rẹ.
I will never see them again, or maybe in a few years.	Emi ko ri wọn lẹẹkansi, tabi boya ni kan ọdun diẹ.
This has happened.	Eyi ti ṣẹlẹ.
Do not buy.	Maṣe ra.
A car veered off the road.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan ti lọ kuro ni opopona.
Everything else can stay the same.	Ohun gbogbo miiran le duro kanna.
Too late.	O ti pẹ ju.
I have not been able to find anything on it.	Emi ko ti le ri nkankan lori rẹ.
It was not this anymore.	O je ko yi mọ.
That doesn’t mean anything to the child.	Iyẹn ko tumọ si nkankan si ọmọde.
Drink in it.	Mu ninu rẹ.
They called me by name.	Wọn ti pe mi ni orukọ.
Your first decision in life?	Ipinnu akọkọ rẹ ni igbesi aye?
Some think it's too fast.	Diẹ ninu awọn ro pe o yara ju.
I had to write a difficult letter.	Mo ni lati kọ kan nira lẹta.
He is happy	Inu re dun
There is still much to be done.	Pupọ ṣi wa lati ṣe.
This raises a lot of problems.	Eyi gbe ọpọlọpọ awọn iṣoro dide.
I'll take care of myself, find what you can.	Emi yoo tọju aṣọ ara mi, wa ohun ti o le.
If they are, great.	Ti wọn ba jẹ, nla.
This should be our way.	Eyi yẹ ki o jẹ ọna wa.
We drink more water	A mu omi diẹ sii
But you will be fine.	Ṣugbọn iwọ yoo dara.
It is up and down.	O wa ni oke si isalẹ.
I can't do anything.	Emi ko le ṣe ohunkohun.
No personal information was obtained.	Ko si alaye ti ara ẹni ti a gba.
You move and stress away.	O gbe ati wahala kuro.
I don't want him to.	Emi ko fe u lati.
What can one say to that.	Kini eniyan le sọ si iyẹn.
When he got home, he found his wife in bed.	Nigbati o de ile, o ba iyawo rẹ ni ibusun.
They always give us enough resources.	Wọn nigbagbogbo fun wa ni awọn ohun elo ti o to.
We did not last long.	A ko pẹ to bẹ.
No one is interested in your work.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o nifẹ si iṣẹ rẹ.
I know it will do great.	Mo mọ pe yoo ṣe nla.
Your job is to make my men fit to work.	Iṣẹ rẹ ni lati jẹ ki awọn ọkunrin mi yẹ lati ṣiṣẹ.
I will have.	Emi yoo ni.
This does not make any sense to me.	Eleyi ko ni ṣe eyikeyi ori si mi.
This is my first job for the company.	Eyi ni iṣẹ akọkọ mi fun ile-iṣẹ naa.
He will need to decide soon.	Oun yoo nilo lati pinnu laipẹ.
I’m not just coming back to play.	Mo n ko kan bọ pada lati mu ṣiṣẹ.
Maybe you made a mistake.	Boya o ṣe aṣiṣe.
It can cause more or less.	O le fa diẹ sii tabi kere si.
But there are bodies, and many of them.	Ṣugbọn awọn ara wa, ati ọpọlọpọ wọn.
It went up.	O lọ soke.
Maybe they'll just treat it.	Boya wọn yoo kan tọju rẹ.
This is the way of life.	Eyi ni ọna igbesi aye.
You give, they get.	O fun, wọn gba.
That is not to say that my team is dead forever.	Iyẹn kii ṣe lati sọ pe ẹgbẹ mi ti ku lailai.
I can do this in two or three jobs.	Mo le ṣe eyi ni awọn iṣẹ meji tabi mẹta.
Look around us.	Wo ni ayika wa.
He began to clear his desk.	O bẹrẹ lati ko tabili rẹ.
They do their job.	Wọn ṣe iṣẹ wọn.
We need to do more to educate our youth.	A nilo lati ṣe diẹ sii lati kọ awọn ọdọ wa.
They work very hard.	Wọn ṣiṣẹ iṣẹ ti o nira pupọ.
She loves to play games.	O nifẹ lati ṣe awọn ere.
You may wonder what it takes longer.	O le Iyanu ohun ti o gba to gun.
It appears in many works of children's literature.	O han ni ọpọlọpọ awọn iṣẹ ti iwe awọn ọmọde.
It looks like my house.	O dabi ile mi.
A lot of time has passed.	Akoko pupọ ti kọja.
I have been great, honestly.	Mo ti jẹ nla, ni otitọ.
The other one was.	Awọn miiran ọkan wà.
I looked at the back of the room.	Mo wo ẹhin yara naa.
Without water, there is no life.	Laisi omi, ko si aye.
But they are interesting.	Sugbon ti won wa awon.
There is also a small.	O tun wa ni kekere kan.
I made a point of not listening.	Mo ṣe aaye kan ti ko gbọ.
There is no question at all about that, of course.	Ko si ibeere kankan rara nipa iyẹn, dajudaju.
From this point on, everything continues to build on itself.	Lati aaye yii, ohun gbogbo n tẹsiwaju lati kọ lori ararẹ.
It was not your favorite room.	O je ko ayanfẹ rẹ yara.
That means this person has everything.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe eniyan yii ni ohun gbogbo patapata.
Nothing alone.	Ko si nkankan nikan.
Just too.	O kan ju.
He passed through it.	O kọja nipasẹ rẹ.
My husband is worried.	Ọkọ mi ṣe aniyan.
It was just a bad day.	O kan ojo buburu kan.
It will be easier in many ways.	Yoo rọrun ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna.
The other two sat up.	Awọn meji miiran joko soke.
For that matter, it is not yet.	Fun ọrọ yẹn, kii ṣe sibẹsibẹ.
They have yours.	Wọn ni tirẹ.
Some of us stood up for a while.	Diẹ ninu wa dide duro fun igba diẹ.
We will see something like this.	A yoo ri nkankan bi yi.
What are you doing or planning to do?	Kini o n ṣe tabi gbero lati ṣe ni?
Everyone else does.	Gbogbo eniyan miiran ṣe.
In fact, maybe it can also help.	Ni otitọ, boya o tun le ṣe iranlọwọ.
But if you have a problem, come to me.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba ni iṣoro kan, wa si mi.
This is nothing more than a love letter.	Eyi kii ṣe nkankan ju lẹta ifẹ lọ.
People know us.	Eniyan mọ wa.
They don’t need to get up around that.	Wọn ko nilo lati dide ni ayika yẹn.
No need to ask.	Ko nilo lati beere.
I did not do that.	Emi ko ṣe iyẹn.
The contract expires.	Adehun naa pari.
It could be my device.	O le jẹ ẹrọ mi.
He watched as he walked along the road.	O wo bi o ti n rin ni opopona.
Try this on a city road.	Gbiyanju eyi ni opopona ilu kan.
Now you look down.	Bayi o wo isalẹ.
We want to make sure we get it right.	A fẹ lati rii daju pe a gba o tọ.
Just one word.	Ọrọ kan nikan.
Some of them have not had any work since.	Diẹ ninu wọn ko tii ni iṣẹ kankan lati igba naa.
But, that is what the police did.	Ṣugbọn, ohun ti ọlọpa ṣe niyẹn.
They can't drink.	Wọn ko le mu.
Let's hope the sun stays out for a while.	Jẹ ki a nireti pe oorun duro jade fun igba diẹ.
You do not understand at all.	O ko loye rara.
Maybe you see, maybe not.	Boya o rii, boya ko ṣe.
If you want help.	Ti o ba ti o fe iranlọwọ.
Unlike the people on the beach, no one was running.	Ko dabi awọn eniyan ti o wa ni eti okun, ko si ẹnikan ti o sare.
He will come.	Oun yoo wa.
This time, it means.	Ni akoko yii, o tumọ si.
He sat at the table.	O joko lori tabili.
You know, notice that.	O mọ, ṣe akiyesi iyẹn.
I want him to come home.	Mo fẹ fun u lati pada si ile.
He hurried across the room.	O sare yara kọja yara naa.
We want to make sure.	A fẹ lati rii daju.
Not sure what else to do here.	Ko daju kini ohun miiran lati ṣe nibi.
Some to eat, some to eat.	Diẹ ninu lati jẹun, diẹ ninu lati jẹ.
He will make the bed.	Oun yoo ṣe ibusun.
It is also outside.	O tun wa ni ita.
He got up and left the room.	O dide o si jade kuro ninu yara naa.
Could it be this ?.	Ṣe o le jẹ eyi?.
Should not go up groups.	Ko yẹ ki o lọ soke awọn ẹgbẹ.
Now he is even with them.	Bayi o paapaa wa pẹlu wọn.
Just let it out.	O kan jẹ ki o mu jade.
I don't want to stay here.	Emi ko fẹ lati duro nibi.
To get out of bed.	Lati jade kuro ni ibusun.
If you get up.	Ti o ba dide.
Help them to use the device!	Ran wọn lọwọ lati lo ẹrọ!
And and the word.	Ati ati ọrọ naa.
He always decided to go out.	Nigbagbogbo o pinnu lati jade.
The streets are full of open water.	Awọn ita ti kun fun omi ti o ṣi silẹ.
The book is out.	Iwe naa ti jade.
It should not have been.	Ko yẹ ki o ti wa.
I really like how they changed.	Mo nifẹ pupọ bi wọn ṣe yipada.
They’re not just about their sites.	Wọn kii ṣe nipa awọn aaye wọn nikan.
I can't say no.	Emi ko le sọ rara.
But at this time the world is even less of nothing to do.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yii aye paapaa kere si ti ohunkohun lati ṣe.
But he realized he didn't want to know.	Ṣugbọn o rii pe oun ko fẹ lati mọ.
Don't try to understand it.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati ṣe oye rẹ.
This area has a lot of rain.	Agbegbe yii ni ọpọlọpọ ojo.
This road goes to the city.	Opopona yii lọ si ilu naa.
You can go up.	O le lọ soke.
This always takes power away.	Eyi nigbagbogbo gba agbara kuro.
Maybe it took us out of that place.	Boya o mu wa kuro ni ibi yẹn.
I wouldn’t believe, we were there that night.	Emi kii yoo gbagbọ, a wa nibẹ ni alẹ yẹn.
You have made a mistake.	O ti ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
I can't wait to use it again.	Emi ko le duro lati lo lẹẹkansi.

Listen to advice.	Gbọ imọran.
Not to start for another two hours.	Ko ṣe lati bẹrẹ fun wakati meji miiran.
I can say it happens, get that money.	Mo le sọ pe o ṣẹlẹ, gba owo yẹn.
I love this moment.	Mo nifẹ akoko yii.
Is there a bus today?	Ṣe ọkọ akero wa loni?
He jumped out.	O fo jade.
This food does not contain much food.	Ounjẹ yii ko ni ounjẹ pupọ.
Like water on the beach.	Bi omi lori eti okun.
He will not live.	Oun ko ni gbe.
This is not difficult.	Eyi ko nira.
Some will take.	Diẹ ninu awọn yoo ya.
I really know family.	Mo gan mọ ebi.
The girls knew they were out for anything they could get.	Awọn ọmọbirin ti o mọ pe wọn jade fun ohunkohun ti wọn le gba.
I know girls like her.	Mo mọ awọn ọmọbirin bi rẹ.
But that is another story.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ itan miiran.
They are the best cars.	Wọn jẹ awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ to dara julọ.
Nothing to do, for what seems like a long time.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣe, fun ohun ti o dabi igba pipẹ.
I don’t want to already know.	Emi ko fẹ lati tẹlẹ mọ.
It is a test for man only.	O jẹ idanwo fun eniyan nikan.
Only a small area remains.	Agbegbe kekere nikan ni o ku.
Not many people on the streets.	Ko ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan lori awọn ita.
You do it every day, and everything, very well.	O ṣe ni gbogbo ọjọ, ati ohun gbogbo, dara julọ.
And the pictures were just coming to me in my head, like.	Ati awọn aworan won o kan bọ si mi ni ori mi, bi.
Well, we did not have time.	O dara, a ko ti akoko.
This is very important to me.	Eyi jẹ pataki julọ fun mi.
Both work as one.	Awọn mejeeji ṣiṣẹ bi ọkan.
So here, nothing serious happened.	Nitorina nibi, ko si ohun pataki ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Please find another way.	Jọwọ wa ọna miiran.
This is a very busy decision.	Eyi jẹ ipinnu iṣẹ pupọ.
All girls should have a good education.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọbirin yẹ ki o ni ẹkọ ti o dara.
If you are or are already married.	Ti o ba wa tabi ti o ti ni iyawo.
I try to think about it really.	Mo gbiyanju lati ronu nipa rẹ gaan.
I do not want to go to this game.	Emi ko fẹ lati lọ si ere yi.
Everyone here knows it.	Gbogbo eniyan nibi mọ o.
You can tell a very real story.	O le sọ itan kan gaan.
Her hair looks beautiful.	Irun rẹ dabi lẹwa.
I have family and friends and school.	Mo ni ebi ati awọn ọrẹ ati ile-iwe.
Do not tell anyone about the accident.	Maṣe sọ fun ẹnikẹni nipa ijamba naa.
You have said the words.	O ti sọ awọn ọrọ naa.
It's while.	O ni nigba ti.
We started going to music.	A bẹrẹ lilọ si orin.
This situation is well known.	A mọ ipo yii daradara.
You don't see it.	O ko ri i.
You will need help.	Iwọ yoo nilo iranlọwọ.
We have a man in the water, in the water.	A ni ọkunrin kan ninu omi, inu omi.
You have everything to lose.	O ni ohun gbogbo lati padanu.
I also hope that maybe it will show up in some way.	Mo tun nireti pe boya yoo han ni ọna kan.
I thought as much.	Mo ro bi Elo.
You have a contract with this dog.	O ti ṣe adehun pẹlu aja yii.
They are not the problem.	Wọn kii ṣe iṣoro naa.
They want me to do well, they will understand.	Wọn fẹ ki n ṣe daradara, wọn yoo loye.
I said on.	Mo ti so lori.
There is no reason for it.	Ko si idi fun o.
For some more than others.	Fun diẹ ninu awọn diẹ sii ju awọn miiran.
You need a special car or something.	O nilo ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ pataki kan tabi nkankan.
I pay attention.	Mo san akiyesi.
I am trying to finish this book.	Mo n gbiyanju lati pari iwe yii.
If you do not, you will not.	Ti ko ba ṣe bẹ, iwọ kii yoo.
He is a worthy driver.	O jẹ awakọ ti o yẹ.
Everyone to man.	Gbogbo eniyan si eniyan.
People who have to help, because that is your job.	Awọn eniyan ti o ni lati ṣe iranlọwọ, nitori pe iṣẹ rẹ niyẹn.
If they are still here, drive again.	Ti wọn ba tun wa nibi, tun wakọ lẹẹkansi.
You do not need anything else.	O ko nilo ohunkohun miiran.
Please let me know if you have any further questions.	Jọwọ jẹ ki mi mọ ti o ba ni awọn ibeere miiran.
He did not look away.	O ko wo kuro.
That blinds you.	Iyẹn fọ ọ loju.
I have no control over it at the moment.	Emi ko ni agbara lori rẹ ni akoko yii.
You will receive this information at some point.	Iwọ yoo gba alaye yii ni akoko kan.
I have no money.	Nko ni owo kankan.
There is nothing interested in it here, he said.	Ko si ohun ti o nifẹ si nibi, o sọ.
In a way it is great.	Ni ọna kan o jẹ nla.
You can read about it here, here, here and here.	O le ka nipa rẹ nibi, nibi, nibi ati nibi.
And we want to see you together.	Ati pe a fẹ lati ri ọ papọ.
Please wake me up when it's time to go.	Jọwọ ji mi nigbati akoko to lati lọ.
So now it has begun.	Nitorina bayi o ti bẹrẹ.
The sweetest thing is.	Ohun ti o dun julọ ni.
I have no money.	Nko ni owo.
It is summer!	Igba ooru ni!
You may feel that we are back.	O le lero pe a ti ti pada.
He is walking away.	O n rin kuro.
Things are not as they seem.	Awọn nkan kii ṣe bi wọn ṣe dabi.
It looks like this.	O dabi eleyi.
Okay, you know, wrong.	O dara, o mọ, ko tọ si.
None of these things are here.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn nkan wọnyi ti o wa nibi.
In fact, it is a big problem.	Ni otitọ, o jẹ iṣoro nla kan.
She is very worried about her work.	O ni aniyan pupọ nipa iṣẹ rẹ.
It can be great.	O le jẹ nla.
The rules of the game are quite simple.	Awọn ofin ti awọn ere jẹ ohun rọrun.
It may not have changed anything for him.	O le ko ti yi pada ohunkohun fun u.
I am only here.	Mo wa nikan nibi.
We will take a bus to the station.	A yoo gba ọkọ akero kan si ibudo naa.
But at this point, this is not a bad thing.	Ṣugbọn ni aaye yii, eyi kii ṣe buburu.
Please do the same for him.	Jọwọ ṣe kanna fun u.
People give you space to do.	Awọn eniyan fun ọ ni aaye lati ṣe.
I’ve seen that before.	Mo ti rii iyẹn tẹlẹ.
Her hair broke my face.	Irun rẹ ti fọ oju mi.
Have you met anyone who went through this?	Njẹ o ti pade ẹnikẹni ti o lọ nipasẹ eyi?
Your office doors are open.	Awọn ilẹkun ọfiisi rẹ ṣi.
And it is also love.	Ati pe o tun jẹ ifẹ.
For a while, things got better.	Fun igba diẹ, awọn nkan dara.
You have done your job well.	O ti ṣe iṣẹ rẹ daradara.
He is a great man.	Eniyan nla ni.
Some things can take a long time to change.	Diẹ ninu awọn nkan le gba akoko pipẹ lati yipada.
I just feel like.	Mo kan lero bi.
The problem is, no one knows what you want.	Wahala ni, ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ ohun ti o fẹ.
All the way down.	Gbogbo ọna isalẹ.
You must read this book.	O gbọdọ ka iwe yii.
This is very important to me.	Eyi ṣe pataki pupọ fun mi.
He gave nothing away.	Ko fun nkankan kuro.
Sit side by side.	Joko ẹgbẹ nipa ẹgbẹ.
Life changes based on these things.	Igbesi aye yipada da lori nkan wọnyi.
I think it helps a lot.	Mo ro pe o ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
I look forward to that day.	Mo nireti si ọjọ yẹn.
Give us advice on what to do.	Fun wa ni imọran kini lati ṣe.
I think more information will continue to come.	Mo ro pe alaye diẹ sii yoo tẹsiwaju lati wa.
Or at least, that’s the way it should be.	Tabi o kere ju, iyẹn ni ọna ti o yẹ ki o jẹ.
No one can or will not write this.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o le tabi kọ eyi.
You’re just taking your clothes off.	O kan n bọ aṣọ rẹ kuro.
Leave the driver's seat.	Fi ijoko awakọ silẹ.
Both are female.	Awọn mejeeji jẹ obinrin.
Like, it always was.	Bi, o nigbagbogbo wà.
Obviously to go.	O han gbangba lati lọ.
I can really.	Mo le gaan.
Young children learn to learn.	Awọn ọmọde kekere kọ ẹkọ lati kọ.
It seems our situation is more.	O dabi ipo wa diẹ.
He has no idea about it.	Ko ni oye nipa rẹ.
I like things to be personal.	Mo fẹran awọn nkan lati jẹ ti ara ẹni.
Whatever happens the situation is not over yet.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ipo naa ko tii pari sibẹsibẹ.
That is a great story.	Iyẹn jẹ itan pupọ.
This is your workplace that took me to.	Eyi ni ibi iṣẹ rẹ ti o mu mi lọ si.
I know they do.	Mo mọ pe wọn ṣe.
You almost call it back.	O fẹrẹ pe e pada.
You need to keep on minding them.	O nilo lati tọju lori wọn.
I could think up games for hours at a time.	Mo ti le ro soke awọn ere fun wakati ni akoko kan.
I work.	Mo si ṣe.
Students dress up for school.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe wọ aṣọ si ile-iwe.
If you need more information just ask.	Ti o ba nilo alaye mọ kan beere.
But that's how it is again.	Ṣugbọn bi o ṣe tun ṣe niyẹn.
Leave that to me.	Fi iyẹn silẹ fun mi.
They do not know yet.	Wọn ko mọ sibẹsibẹ.
Rest is especially important.	Isinmi ṣe pataki paapaa.
Not just any other person, either.	Kii ṣe eniyan miiran nikan, boya.
A long time passed in this way.	Igba pipẹ kọja ni ọna yii.
Who does not want to sit is.	Ti ko fẹ lati joko jẹ.
But go ahead.	Sugbon ki o lọ.
This house is one of the first public buildings.	Ile yii jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ile akọkọ ti gbogbo eniyan.
However it has happened.	Sibẹsibẹ o ti ṣẹlẹ.
Or maybe value is the most important thing.	Tabi boya iye jẹ ohun ti o ṣe pataki julọ.
Maybe, even, even so.	Boya, paapaa, paapaa bẹ.
One knows why, of course.	Ọkan mọ idi, dajudaju.
I hope they will accept my request.	Mo nireti pe wọn yoo gba ibeere mi.
Wake up, can you hear me?	Ji, ṣe o gbọ mi?
This is another test in law school.	Eyi jẹ idanwo miiran ni ile-iwe ofin.
You have already seen.	O ti ri tẹlẹ.
Methods for some of them are handy.	Awọn ọna fun diẹ ninu awọn ti wọn wa ni ọwọ.
It is not appropriate to bring out this way.	O ti ko yẹ lati mu jade ni ọna yi.
However only one group wants to do anything about it.	Sibẹsibẹ ẹgbẹ kan nikan fẹ lati ṣe ohunkohun nipa rẹ.
The future is uncertain.	Ojo iwaju ko ni idaniloju.
Why don't you.	Kini idi ti iwọ ko ṣe.
We believe that.	A gbagbọ pe.
We treat it very, very easy.	A tọju rẹ pupọ, rọrun pupọ.
He pulled out a loaf of bread.	O gbe apoti akara kan jade.
You must have a good one to be a doctor.	O gbọdọ ni ọkan ti o dara lati jẹ dokita.
Just come.	O kan wa.
I have a table with some values.	Mo ni tabili pẹlu diẹ ninu awọn iye.
The girl was left alone on the beach.	Ọmọbirin naa ni a fi silẹ nikan ni eti okun.
I can do either.	Mo le ṣe boya.
They usually take about 30 minutes to run.	Wọn maa n gba to ọgbọn iṣẹju lati ṣiṣe.
We do not know what it will look like, however.	A ko mọ bi oun yoo dabi, sibẹsibẹ.
If this marriage does not work out, it will never happen again.	Ti igbeyawo yii ko ba ṣiṣẹ, ko ni tun ṣe lẹẹkansi.
She went to a restaurant.	O lọ si ile ounjẹ kan.
He does not like me.	Ko feran mi.
I should not bring him here.	Emi ko yẹ ki o mu u wa si ibi.
You have to have money.	O ni lati ni owo.
Thirty minutes pass.	Ọgbọn iṣẹju kọja.
While he was watching, he was taken away.	Nigbati o n wo rẹ, o ti gbe lọ.
That means a lot.	Iyẹn tumọ si pupọ.
But that is not possible.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣee ṣe.
I still do not believe this.	Emi ko tun gbagbọ eyi.
This does not apply to you.	Eyi ko kan ọ.
However, it is here now.	Sibẹsibẹ, o wa nibi bayi.
Think about whether you agree with it.	Ronu nipa boya o gba pẹlu rẹ.
He pulls it.	O fa ni i.
You know, it’s very simple like that.	O mọ, o rọrun pupọ bi iyẹn.
I do not have one.	Emi ko ni ọkan.
But something stopped me.	Sugbon nkankan da mi duro.
If you do, you have nothing to worry about.	Ti o ba ṣe, o ko ni nkankan lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
No, that is not enough.	Rara, iyẹn ko to.
We have time.	A ni akoko.
We desperately need it.	A nilo rẹ gidigidi.
I know they will not.	Mo mọ ti won yoo ko.
Or at least I feel like it’s working.	Tabi o kere ju Mo lero bi ẹni pe o n ṣiṣẹ lọwọ.
I will of course do it again.	Emi yoo dajudaju tun ṣe lẹẹkansi.
My mother did not want us.	Iya mi ko fẹ wa.
We have no way of knowing.	A ko ni ọna ti o mọ.
I think that is there to see.	Mo ro pe iyẹn wa lati rii.
We do so by hand.	A ṣe bẹ lati ọwọ.
My cottage is near the river.	Ile kekere mi wa nitosi odo.
You may not remember it now.	O le ma ranti rẹ ni bayi.
Or do you think.	Tabi ko ro.
He took care of her.	O tọju rẹ.
I have no idea how fast this car will be.	Emi ko ni imọran bi ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yii yoo ṣe yara to.
When did you like this?	Nigbawo ni o fẹ eyi?
This seemed.	Eleyi dabi enipe.
They can sleep or they can read a book.	Wọn le sun oorun tabi wọn le ka iwe kan.
A few things are over.	Diẹ diẹ awọn nkan ti pari.
I think they are bad.	Mo ro won buburu.
The door closed behind me.	Ilẹkun si pa lẹhin mi.
I stood there, very scared to move.	Mo duro jẹ, bẹru pupọ lati gbe.
Maybe not the time or the place.	Boya kii ṣe akoko tabi aaye naa.
We never heard of them again.	Ko si ohun ti a gbọ ti wọn lẹẹkansi.
Education is the most important thing in life.	Ẹkọ jẹ ohun pataki julọ ni igbesi aye.
I won't even try.	Emi kii yoo gbiyanju paapaa.
Much of anything, you could say.	Pupọ ti ohunkohun, o le sọ.
They love it.	Wọn fẹran rẹ.
Come on, we can not miss the moment.	Wa, a ko le padanu akoko.
This is how it should be done.	Eyi ni bi o ṣe yẹ ki o ṣe.
They have to sell me.	Wọn ni lati ta mi.
Ask everyone you know.	Beere gbogbo eniyan ti o mọ.
We know what pictures sell and what they don’t.	A mọ kini awọn aworan n ta ati ohun ti kii ṣe.
I know you have.	Mo mọ pe o ni.
We will call until we are well educated.	A yoo pe titi ti a yoo fi kọ ẹkọ daradara.
Of course it should be.	Dajudaju o yẹ ki o jẹ.
We were outside for weeks.	A wa ni ita fun awọn ọsẹ.
I will not sleep here.	Emi ko ni sun nibi.
I decided not.	Mo pinnu ko.
The environment changed.	Ayika yipada.
We love the artwork we use very much.	Awọn iṣẹ ọna ti a lo nifẹ rẹ pupọ.
And you have more reason to eat than too much.	Ati pe o ni idi diẹ sii lati jẹ ju pupọ julọ lọ.
Put the baby in the crib and lock the door.	Fi ọmọ naa sinu ibusun ibusun ki o si ti ilẹkun.
I can't stand anything like that.	Emi ko le duro nkankan bi wipe.
You have to believe me.	O ni lati gba mi gbọ.
That is why we need to leave now.	Ti o ni idi ti a nilo lati lọ kuro ni bayi.
This does not matter.	Eyi ko ṣe nkankan.
It's just me thinking about it.	O rẹ mi kan ro nipa rẹ.
But we have a lot more questions to get.	Ṣugbọn a ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere diẹ sii lati gba.
I think the baby has come into yours.	Mo ro pe ọmọ naa ti wa sinu tirẹ.
But the group was outside, and they ate.	Ṣugbọn ẹgbẹ naa wa ni ita, ti wọn jẹun.
The question is, why, and why now ?.	Ibeere naa ni, kilode, ati kilode ni bayi?.
But if you do not know that you are doing well.	Ṣugbọn ti o ko ba mọ pe o n ṣe daradara.
So, what’s so special about this place?	Nitorina, kini pataki nipa ibi yii?
It was a beautiful program.	O jẹ eto ti o lẹwa.
That may come after the baby is born.	Iyẹn le wa lẹhin ti o ba bi ọmọ naa.
The world is watching.	Aye n wo.
I was already feeling good.	Mo ti rilara dara tẹlẹ.
I am.	Emi ni emi.
But still, he noticed.	Ṣugbọn sibẹsibẹ, o ṣe akiyesi.
Not true, as it turned out.	Kii ṣe otitọ, bi o ti yipada.
You see how they are when they are together.	O ti rii bi wọn ṣe jẹ nigbati wọn ba wa papọ.
Please, just no.	Jọwọ, o kan rara.
What is the cause of the stress?	Kini idi ti wahala?
I think that is important.	Mo ro pe iyẹn ṣe pataki.
You may have died.	O le ti ku.
We walk after our dinner.	A n rin lẹhin ounjẹ alẹ wa.
And we stopped.	Ati pe a duro.
What are these people out of their minds.	Kini awọn eniyan wọnyi jade ninu ọkan wọn.
Here you see how my face looks.	Nibi o rii bi oju mi ​​ṣe ri.
Although things seem the same, they have changed.	Bi o ti jẹ pe awọn nkan dabi kanna, wọn ti yipada.
It was decided.	O ti pinnu.
We had a good time.	A ni akoko ti o dara.
The father was unemployed for three months.	Baba naa ko ni iṣẹ fun oṣu mẹta.
This is no longer a place for women and children.	Eyi kii ṣe aaye fun awọn obinrin ati awọn ọmọde mọ.
The school received a lot of heat on their decision.	Ile-iwe naa gba ooru pupọ lori ipinnu wọn.
And we should keep that in mind.	Ati pe a yẹ ki o tọju iyẹn.
Stop them from playing with our homes and lives.	Da wọn duro lati ṣe ere pẹlu awọn ile ati igbesi aye wa.
Can we go for a driver?	Njẹ a le lọ fun awakọ kan?
When we finished the kids, we just came back.	Nigba ti a ba pari awọn ọmọde, a kan pada wa.
The path draws in your heart.	Ọna naa fa ni ọkan rẹ.
You will enjoy it.	Iwọ yoo gbadun rẹ.
And we had a very good time.	Ati pe a ni akoko ti o dara pupọ.
Today, education needs more than ever.	Loni, ẹkọ nilo diẹ sii ju lailai.
I love working in a garden.	Mo nifẹ ṣiṣẹ ninu ọgba kan.
I do not want to stay indoors.	Emi ko fẹ lati duro ninu ile.
I was in my car, driving through town.	Mo wa ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi, ti n wakọ nipasẹ ilu.
You can hurt or even kill yourself.	O le ṣe ipalara tabi paapaa pa ara rẹ.
But it is too late.	Ṣugbọn o pẹ ju.
Just go.	O kan lọ.
My application works fine.	Ohun elo mi ṣiṣẹ daradara.

No, of course he is.	Rara, dajudaju oun ni.
He seemed to grow more beautiful in his eyes.	O dabi enipe o dagba diẹ sii lẹwa ni oju rẹ.
You will find that it is the fastest car.	Iwọ yoo rii pe o jẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o yara ju.
It is all outside the scope of the problem.	O jẹ gbogbo ita si iṣoro naa.
Some people may lose their jobs.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan le padanu awọn iṣẹ wọn.
Values ​​are important what matters to us.	Awọn iye jẹ pataki ohun ti o ṣe pataki si wa.
And that will always happen.	Ati pe iyẹn yoo ṣẹlẹ nigbagbogbo.
Go to work.	Lọ si iṣẹ.
Mothers should love their children.	Awọn iya yẹ ki o nifẹ awọn ọmọ wọn.
These are the people you know, these are your favorites.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn eniyan ti o mọ, awọn wọnyi ni awọn ayanfẹ rẹ.
We will talk to your father.	A yoo ba baba rẹ sọrọ.
I know these cars.	Mo mọ awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wọnyi.
The family has no facilities for anything else.	Idile ko ni awọn ohun elo fun ohunkohun miiran.
Look at your hand.	Wo ọwọ rẹ.
However there is some truth.	Sibẹsibẹ otitọ diẹ wa nibẹ.
Someone is writing a play about it, the book says.	Ẹnikan n kọ ere kan nipa rẹ, iwe naa sọ.
We cannot ask you anything else.	A ko le beere lọwọ rẹ ohunkohun miiran.
They can change based on harmful information or public opinion.	Wọn le yi lori alaye ipalara tabi imọran ti gbogbo eniyan.
Money remains very important for most of us.	Owo si maa wa gan pataki fun julọ ti wa.
Beat while the metal is hot.	Lu nigba ti irin jẹ gbona.
I am your big sister.	Emi ni arabinrin nla rẹ.
The train is full today.	Ọkọ oju irin naa ti kun loni.
You will not die.	Iwọ kii yoo ku.
Still do not know why he asked.	Ṣi ko mọ idi ti o beere.
My car just ran over her cat.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi kan sare lori ologbo rẹ.
You need the money.	O nilo owo naa.
Must be new.	Gbọdọ jẹ tuntun.
I would like to put it off more.	Emi yoo fẹ lati fi si pa diẹ si.
Everyone is working towards a better life.	Gbogbo eniyan n ṣiṣẹ si ọna igbesi aye to dara julọ.
All you have to do is sit down and that’s enough.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ni lati ṣe ni joko ati pe iyẹn to.
I can't think of what other people think of me.	Emi ko le ronu nipa ohun ti awọn eniyan miiran ro nipa mi.
You will not be home before another hour.	O ko ni wa ni ile ṣaaju wakati miiran.
As far as possible notice.	Bi o ti ṣee ṣe akiyesi.
Only two lucky people eat here.	Awọn eniyan ti o ni anfani meji nikan ni o jẹun nibi.
So you can use that.	Nitorina o le lo iyẹn.
He has no dog.	Ko ni aja.
Some people do not learn.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ko kọ ẹkọ.
My brother told me all this.	Arakunrin mi sọ gbogbo nkan yii fun mi.
My year with him was one of my favorite years of football.	Ọdun mi pẹlu rẹ jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọdun ayanfẹ mi ti bọọlu.
It has value.	O ni iye.
It happens again.	O tun n ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
Die with you.	Ku pẹlu rẹ.
It is no small task to make this happen.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ kekere lati jẹ ki eyi ṣẹlẹ.
We had to stop a lot of boats that day.	A ni lati da ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkọ oju omi duro ni ọjọ yẹn.
For me it is nothing.	Fun mi kii ṣe nkankan.
I know you should.	Mo mọ pe o yẹ.
In the background, that seems to be longer than time.	Ni ẹhin, iyẹn dabi ẹni pe o gun ju akoko lọ.
He was great the first season or two.	O si wà nla ni akọkọ akoko tabi meji.
That sorry, no question.	Iyẹn binu, ko si ibeere.
Now not anymore, times change.	Bayi kii ṣe mọ, awọn akoko yipada.
However life goes on.	Sibẹsibẹ igbesi aye tẹsiwaju.
Let it go.	Jẹ ki o lọ gbe.
They are very good about that.	Wọn dara pupọ nipa nkan bẹẹ.
Well caught.	Ti mu daradara.
I wish they had done better, really.	Mo fẹ pe wọn ti ṣe dara julọ, ni otitọ.
I would recommend it to anyone.	Emi yoo so fun u si ẹnikẹni.
And some people also need rest from time to time.	Ati diẹ ninu awọn eniyan tun nilo isinmi lati igba de igba.
This time it was my mother.	Ni akoko yii o jẹ iya mi.
I have seen you do so.	Mo ti ri ti o ṣe bẹ.
Very good !.	O dara julọ!.
Accept that.	Gba iyẹn.
This is back here.	Eyi n pada sẹhin nibi.
Another issue of this school is the students.	Ọrọ miiran ti ile-iwe yii ni ni awọn ọmọ ile-iwe.
You are all around.	Gbogbo yin ti wa ni ayika.
That has an advantage.	Ti o ni anfani kan.
Just talk.	O kan sọrọ.
Easy, he said.	Rọrun, o sọ.
As money.	Bi owo ri.
Others have walked this path before.	Awọn miiran ti rin ọna yii ṣaaju ki o to.
Times are difficult.	Awọn igba jẹ nira.
Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn’t.	Nigba miiran o ṣe ati nigba miiran kii ṣe.
The boy was obviously angry.	Ọmọkunrin naa binu ni gbangba.
The first for either of us.	Ni igba akọkọ ti fun boya ti wa.
Just beautiful in it.	O kan lẹwa ninu rẹ.
Nothing can stop him now.	Ko si ohun ti o le da a duro bayi.
It just did not happen.	O kan ko ṣẹlẹ.
He did not think anything.	Ko ro ohunkohun.
As a matter of fact it does.	Bi ọrọ kan ti o daju o ṣe.
If you are still around, we will see you tomorrow.	Ti o ba tun wa ni ayika, a yoo rii ni ọla.
This case has no place.	Idi eyi ko si ni aaye.
Maybe you should think again, but it won’t.	Boya o yẹ ki o tun ronu, ṣugbọn kii yoo ṣe.
He hated his family up to this point.	O korira idile rẹ titi di aaye yii.
There is a reason for that.	Idi kan wa fun iyẹn.
I would have expected that.	Emi yoo ti nireti iyẹn.
I have talked about it a lot with him.	Mo ti sọrọ nipa rẹ pupọ pẹlu rẹ.
Good for us.	O dara fun wa.
Everything you think they can get their hands on.	Ohun gbogbo ti o ro pe wọn le gba ọwọ wọn.
It is out of town on money.	O ti wa ni ita ilu lori owo.
It’s a great idea.	O jẹ imọran nla.
Any further questions, just ask.	Eyikeyi ibeere diẹ sii, kan beere.
We are timely.	A ni o wa ti akoko.
He stole some money.	O ji diẹ ninu owo.
There are so many that you do not yet understand.	O wa pupọ ti o ko tii loye.
I started asking about my biological parents.	Mo bẹrẹ si beere nipa awọn obi ti a bi mi.
Everything went to him.	Ohun gbogbo ti lọ si i.
I think they are very good.	Mo ro pe wọn dara pupọ.
It looks great in any setting.	O dabi ẹni nla ni eyikeyi eto.
You give and you receive and you receive and you receive.	O fun ati pe o gba ati pe o gba ati pe o gba.
I left.	Mo ti fi silẹ.
Harm to man.	Ipalara si eniyan.
You will have to listen with everyone else.	Iwọ yoo ni lati gbọ pẹlu gbogbo eniyan miiran.
Just be wise now.	O kan jẹ imọran ni bayi.
You must want the best.	O gbọdọ fẹ dara julọ.
Send yours to us and be the first !.	Fi tirẹ ranṣẹ si wa ki o jẹ akọkọ !.
It was a victory.	O je kan gun.
At most this is not a problem.	Ni pupọ julọ eyi ko jẹ iṣoro.
This is our world.	Eyi ni aye wa.
I can call some people from work.	Mo le pe diẹ ninu awọn eniyan lati iṣẹ.
Without really trying.	Laisi gbiyanju gaan.
You will see with light.	Iwọ yoo rii pẹlu ina.
So it seems he has no explanation on what his name is.	Nitorina o dabi pe ko ṣe alaye lori kini orukọ rẹ.
One every year is a lot.	Ọkan ni gbogbo ọdun jẹ pupọ.
It does not mean that there is nothing to do.	Ko tumọ si pe ko si nkankan lati ṣe.
How will you find your way home?	Bawo ni iwọ yoo ṣe wa ọna rẹ si ile?
I told him to stop and let me watch it.	Mo sọ fun u pe ki o duro jẹ ki n wo o.
The sister was angry.	Arabinrin naa binu.
He will leave you soon enough.	Yoo fi ọ silẹ laipẹ to.
However there is nothing they can do about it.	Sibẹsibẹ ko si ohun ti wọn le ṣe nipa rẹ.
That has happened.	Iyẹn ti ṣẹlẹ.
I was in love with her.	Mo ti wà ni ife pẹlu rẹ.
It can only work.	O le ṣiṣẹ nikan.
I'm very happy.	Inu mi dun pupo.
But not good.	Sugbon ko dara.
You know, too.	O mọ, ju.
He began to say nothing but no.	O bẹrẹ lati sọ nkankan sugbon ko.
The system is here.	Ni eto ni ibi.
We want to accept.	A fẹ lati gba.
I can't even.	Emi ko le paapaa.
The whole family lives at home.	Gbogbo ebi ti ngbe ni ile.
You can read that here.	O le ka pe nibi.
I do not understand why any of you do.	Emi ko loye idi ti eyikeyi ninu yin ṣe.
And how happy we are.	Ati bawo ni inu wa ṣe dun.
This cannot continue forever.	Eyi ko le tẹsiwaju lailai.
Another thing you know is that it’s time to go.	Ohun miiran ti o mọ ni pe o to akoko lati lọ.
The question is.	Ibeere naa wa.
At first it was not bad.	Ni akọkọ kii ṣe buburu.
He did everything he said he would do.	O ṣe ohun gbogbo ti o sọ pe o ṣe.
I invited everyone.	Mo ti pe gbogbo eniyan.
He did not ask me for any money, nor to buy anything for him.	Ko beere fun mi fun owo kankan, tabi lati ra ohunkohun fun u.
The sister has the most beautiful body you have ever imagined.	Arabinrin naa ni ara ti o lẹwa julọ ti o ti ro tẹlẹ.
Today you can see their true face.	Loni o le rii oju otitọ wọn.
He is a very good friend and you should know about us.	O jẹ ọrẹ to dara julọ ati pe o yẹ ki o mọ nipa wa.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know.	Ti o ba ni awọn imọran eyikeyi, jọwọ jẹ ki mi mọ.
She will feel married to you.	O yoo lero iyawo si o.
Wait for the first two weeks to pass.	Duro fun ọsẹ meji akọkọ lati kọja.
Cost depends on location and duration of the project.	Iye owo da lori ipo ati iye akoko iṣẹ naa.
I wish you would come.	Mo fẹ pe iwọ yoo wa.
It has nothing to do with it.	Ko ṣe nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
It will be fine.	Yoo dara.
I watched the girl go, her head raised.	Mo wo ọmọbirin naa ti n lọ, ori rẹ gbe ga.
Children do not need to grow as they think, perhaps, they should.	Awọn ọmọde ko nilo lati dagba bi wọn ṣe ro, boya, wọn yẹ.
It's hot today.	O gbona loni.
But that is not their purpose.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe idi wọn.
Everyone will ask.	Gbogbo eniyan yoo beere awọn.
This area is known for its hair follicles.	Agbegbe yii ni a mọ fun awọn irun ori rẹ.
And it's coming hot.	O si n bọ ni gbona.
Way out.	Ọna jade.
I am not afraid of them.	Emi ko bẹru wọn.
You already know very well what to expect.	O ti mọ pupọ julọ kini lati reti.
But it may be too late.	Ṣugbọn o le pẹ ju.
Whether you do it or not, it doesn't mean much to me.	Boya o ṣe tabi ko ṣe, ko tumọ si pupọ fun mi.
Maybe it was yes.	Boya o je bẹni.
He has two brothers.	O ni awọn arakunrin meji.
Communities start to fill up with people.	Awọn agbegbe bẹrẹ lati kun pẹlu eniyan.
I want to leave that.	Mo fẹ fi silẹ niyẹn.
So you have to believe me.	Nitorina o ni lati gba mi gbọ.
You have to be a child, you know.	O ni lati jẹ ọmọ, o mọ.
They do not need two at all.	Wọn ko nilo meji rara.
So eat your dinner while it is still warm.	Nitorina jẹ ounjẹ alẹ rẹ nigba ti o tun gbona.
Can you help ?.	Ṣe o le ṣe iranlọwọ?.
There are other ways to drink water.	Awọn ọna miiran wa lati mu omi.
He asked about it.	O beere nipa rẹ.
I am the one who needs it.	Emi ni ẹniti o nilo.
He has done so many times.	O ti ṣe bẹ ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
I could not have written.	Emi ko le ti kọ.
Don't miss it now.	Maṣe padanu rẹ ni bayi.
But without time, that means something.	Ṣugbọn laisi akoko, iyẹn tumọ si nkankan.
It is already for you.	O ti ni tẹlẹ fun ọ.
You do things.	O ṣe awọn nkan.
Something will happen tomorrow.	Nkankan yoo ṣẹlẹ ni ọla.
So my man has said.	Nitorina ọkunrin mi ti sọ.
We live in the past and the present.	A n gbe ni ti o ti kọja bayi ati ojo iwaju.
He remembers it all.	O ranti gbogbo rẹ.
It has been.	O ti wa.
But it was the same everywhere.	Sugbon o je kanna nibi gbogbo.
The reasons for this are uncertain.	Awọn idi fun eyi ko ni idaniloju.
I can talk to anyone about anything.	Mo le ba ẹnikẹni sọrọ nipa ohunkohun.
They want to kill me.	Wọn fẹ pa mi.
Things like that.	Awọn nkan bii .
Or even longer.	Tabi paapaa gun ju.
The city talks and talks.	Ilu sọrọ ati sọrọ.
It may be more to be done than you expect.	O le jẹ diẹ sii lati ṣee ju ti o nireti lọ.
This is for everything.	Eyi jẹ fun ohun gbogbo.
People believe it is amazing.	Awọn eniyan gbagbọ pe o jẹ iyanu.
He refuses to look up.	O kọ lati wo soke.
If you do, this is for you.	Ti o ba ṣe, eyi jẹ fun ọ.
You must have needed it.	O gbọdọ ti nilo rẹ.
To take the life of a little girl.	Lati gba igbesi aye ọmọbirin kekere kan.
You can see them die and die again.	O le wo wọn ti o ku ki o ku lẹẹkansi.
Ask for your name.	Beere orukọ rẹ.
Where it belongs.	Ibi ti o je ti.
But they are not anything like you have seen before.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii ṣe ohunkohun bi o ti rii tẹlẹ.
I do not really need this.	Emi ko nilo eyi gaan.
The reasons for our conclusion are twofold.	Awọn idi fun ipari wa jẹ meji.
But let’s try to be.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki a gbiyanju lati jẹ.
We have to get a plane.	A ni lati gba ọkọ ofurufu kan.
Can not.	Ko le.
I would only ride a car with a woman.	Emi yoo nikan wọ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan pẹlu obinrin kan.
But it is in it too.	Ṣugbọn o wa ninu rẹ paapaa.
It takes some time to learn.	O gba akoko diẹ lati kọ ẹkọ.
I have a chance for him.	Mo ni anfani fun u.
It is my way of testing people.	O jẹ ọna mi lati ṣe idanwo eniyan.
We kept it until morning.	A tọju rẹ titi di owurọ.
I went to the wedding.	Mo lọ si igbeyawo.
It is too late for that now.	O ti pẹ ju fun iyẹn ni bayi.
Don't delay.	Maṣe pẹ.
But you did not write.	Ṣugbọn iwọ ko kọ.
I paid the same.	Mo ti san kanna.
The family moved to live in the city.	Ebi gbe lati gbe ni ilu.
Look, you have known the child all your life.	Wo, o ti mọ ọmọ naa ni gbogbo igbesi aye rẹ.
My family, my children.	Idile mi, awọn ọmọ mi.
We should laugh more.	A yẹ ki o rẹrin diẹ sii.
If you have any questions, just ask me.	Ti o ba ni ibeere eyikeyi, kan beere lọwọ mi.
We waited for the baby to be born.	A duro de ibi ọmọ.
There is also to be done.	O tun wa lati ṣe.
He went home.	O lọ si ile.
He never spoke out again.	O ko sọrọ jade lẹẹkansi.
I talked to my husband.	Mo ti sọrọ pẹlu ọkọ mi.
They often call themselves "brothers."	Wọn a ma pe ara wọn ni "arakunrin."
We do not doubt this conclusion.	A ko ṣiyemeji ipari yii.
He is behind me.	O wa lẹhin mi.
A few people at first.	Awọn eniyan diẹ ni akọkọ.
Our team will be in the field tomorrow.	Ẹgbẹ wa yoo wa ni aaye ni ọla.
I use them.	Mo lo wọn.
Not just by your ears.	Kii ṣe nipasẹ eti rẹ nikan.
Good to come back.	O dara lati pada wa.
Find a way to talk to people.	Wa ọna lati ba eniyan sọrọ.
I only killed men.	Awọn ọkunrin nikan ni mo pa.
And we can't reverse that.	Ati pe a ko le da iyẹn pada.
So his family took him home.	Nitorina awon ebi re mu u ile.
I have two classes.	Mo ni meji kilasi.
It was very high for his years.	O ga pupọ fun awọn ọdun rẹ.
They arrested the wrong person.	Wọn mu eniyan ti ko tọ.
They are all not lost.	Gbogbo wọn ko padanu.
It doesn’t make any sense.	Ko ṣe ori eyikeyi.
It is completely up to you.	O wa patapata si ọ.
I can see it.	Mo ti le ri rẹ.
We are constantly working	A n ṣiṣẹ nigbagbogbo
If you want to see.	Ti o ba fẹ lati rii.
Do not worry too much about your diet.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan pupọ nipa ounjẹ rẹ.
I was also a little scared.	Mo tun bẹru diẹ.
We have to talk about what happened.	A ni lati sọrọ nipa ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
I believe you have enough material here for a new book.	Mo gbagbọ pe o ni ohun elo to nibi fun iwe tuntun kan.
He thought no.	O ro ko.
All you need to do is learn how to speak.	Gbogbo ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe ni kọ ẹkọ bi o ṣe le sọrọ.
So not yet.	Nitorina ko sibẹsibẹ.
I will give him much.	Emi yoo fun u ni Elo.
I have no idea why the advice could not be used.	Emi ko ni imọran idi ti imọran ko le lo.
She is very angry.	O binu pupọ.
Why not just go back to sleep?	Kilode ti o ko kan pada sun?
Not easy, of course.	Ko rọrun, dajudaju.
There is space to store both things.	O wa aaye lati tọju awọn nkan mejeeji.
A face he has not seen in years.	A oju ti o ti ko ri ni odun.
We know what to do.	A mọ kini lati ṣe.
People think they are.	Awọn eniyan ro pe wọn jẹ.
Now we have.	Bayi ni a ni.
I'm in trouble here.	Mo wa ninu wahala nibi.
It is clear.	O ti wa ni wipe ko o.
I think we’ve made a great football.	Mo ro pe a ti ṣe bọọlu ti o dara julọ.
It is better not to think about this too much.	O dara julọ lati ma ronu nipa eyi pupọ.
He did not want this season to end.	Ko fẹ ki akoko yii pari.
Everyone who is in the right one is out.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o wa ni ọkan ti o tọ ti jade.
Not enough.	Ko to mọ.
It is life, however.	O jẹ aye, sibẹsibẹ.
That is an amazing amount.	Iye iyalẹnu niyẹn.
He held both his hands.	O di ọwọ rẹ mejeeji.
And when he got there, he was obviously upset.	Ati nigbati o de ibi, o han gbangba pe inu rẹ binu.
But that man is finished.	Ṣugbọn ọkunrin yẹn ti pari.
They just love each other.	Wọn kan nifẹ ara wọn.
I will leave that to future work.	Emi yoo fi iyẹn silẹ si iṣẹ iwaju.
Everyone in your community knows you.	Gbogbo eniyan ni agbegbe rẹ mọ ọ.
I have received.	Mo ti wa gba.
They buy everything they need or want.	Wọn ra ohun gbogbo ti wọn nilo tabi fẹ.
Please accept the price.	Jọwọ gba owo naa.
They get a lot of mistakes.	Wọn gba aṣiṣe pupọ.
Ask a lot of questions about that person.	Beere awọn ibeere pupọ nipa ẹni yẹn.
Not always.	Ko ni gbogbo igba.
What you really want is to stop and talk.	Ohun ti o fẹ gaan ni lati duro ati sọrọ.
He has not drunk for himself.	Ko tii mu fun ara re.
I really enjoyed the way things turned out.	Inu mi dun gaan ni ọna ti awọn nkan ṣe jade.
Things are starting to get special.	Awọn nkan n bẹrẹ lati ni pataki.
They are not information services.	Wọn kii ṣe iṣẹ alaye.
It almost seems not there.	O fẹrẹ dabi pe ko si nibẹ.
Count your age in dog years.	Ka ọjọ ori rẹ ni awọn ọdun aja.
People will listen to them, in one way or another.	Awọn eniyan yoo gbọ wọn, ni ọna kan tabi awọn miiran.
This you have done.	Eleyi ti o ti ṣe.
If you can call it our side, that’s it.	Ti o ba le pe ni ẹgbẹ wa, iyẹn ni.
You’re doing well, just continue to do what you’ve been doing.	O ti n ṣe daradara, kan tẹsiwaju lati ṣe ohun ti o ti n ṣe.
Now and forever.	Bayi ati lailai.
I will try to reach you tonight.	Emi yoo gbiyanju lati de ọdọ rẹ ni alẹ oni.
No information required.	Ko nilo alaye.
I also bring this for you.	Mo tun mu eyi wa fun ọ.
What matters is what you do with them.	Ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni ohun ti o ṣe pẹlu wọn.
It was a good decision.	O je kan ti o dara ipinnu.
This brother took advice to one.	Arakunrin yii gba imọran si ọkan.
They are in the back of the house.	Wọn wa ni ẹhin ile naa.
All seats taken.	Gbogbo ijoko ti a ya.
He told himself that.	O sọ fun ara rẹ pe.
If not this hour.	Ti kii ba ṣe wakati yii.
I don’t know how I can get into this.	Emi ko mọ bi mo ṣe le lọ sinu eyi.
It should be easy.	O yẹ ki o rọrun.
These children need a doctor.	Awọn ọmọ wọnyi nilo dokita kan.
He could not move.	Ko le gbe.
You can do it completely, even.	O le ṣe patapata, paapaa.
I have found that.	Mo ti ri pe.
Now the word is that it is always true.	Bayi ọrọ naa ni pe o jẹ otitọ nigbagbogbo.
Notice how he did not kill the man.	Ṣe akiyesi bi ko ṣe pa eniyan naa.
You don’t think you can be here.	O ko ronu pe o le wa nibi.
They are not like drinking.	Wọn ko dabi mimu.
I asked him if he needed to talk.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ boya o nilo lati sọrọ.
We need to give them space to grow.	A nilo lati fun wọn ni aye lati dagba.
Of all costs.	Ti gbogbo iye owo.
She forced herself to look at her face again.	O fi agbara mu ara rẹ lati tun wo oju rẹ lẹẹkansi.
No time for more.	Ko si akoko fun diẹ sii.
I had a good time.	Mo ni akoko ti o dara.
I agree that there may be a problem.	Mo gba pe iṣoro le wa.
I want to do something for myself.	Mo fẹ ṣe nkan fun ara mi.
And pull, and pull, and pull.	Ati ki o fa, ki o si fa, ki o si fa.
Maybe love has always stood.	Boya ifẹ ti duro nigbagbogbo.
For maybe one of us.	Fun boya ọkan ninu wa.
Not that they can even see much of anything up here.	Kii ṣe pe wọn le paapaa rii pupọ ti ohunkohun soke nibi.
No big deal here.	Ko si adehun nla nibi.
We are down a side.	A wa ni isalẹ ẹgbẹ kan.
Most people will be hurt.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan yoo ni ipalara.
Change, or wash it all together.	Yi pada, tabi fo gbogbo rẹ papọ.
But nothing for.	Sugbon ti ohunkohun ko fun.
I would hope that will be possible.	Emi yoo nireti pe yoo ṣee ṣe.
Everyone needs good friends.	Gbogbo eniyan nilo awọn ọrẹ to dara.
I already know who he is.	Mo ti mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
They are convinced by women.	Awọn obinrin ni o da wọn loju.
I live at home with my mother and father.	Mo n gbe ni ile pẹlu iya ati baba mi.
It makes you think.	O mu ki o ronu.
But it’s not what you want to hear.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ohun ti o fẹ lati gbọ.
His mother shook my head.	Iya re mi ori.
Complete the planned tests.	Pari awọn idanwo ti a gbero.
I'm just telling you that.	Mo kan n sọ fun ọ iyẹn.
It wears well.	O wọ daradara.
I was about to start walking when someone called me.	Mo ti fẹrẹ bẹrẹ si rin nigbati ẹnikan ba pe mi.
You are going to find your keys.	O ti lọ lati wa awọn bọtini rẹ.
Just going to take the time.	O kan lilọ lati gba akoko.
You are very beautiful.	O lẹwa pupọ.
The marriage was happy.	Igbeyawo naa dun.
Today is a great day.	Oni ni ojo nla.
They are on their way.	Wọn wa lori ọna wọn.
This may change in the future.	Eyi le yipada ni ojo iwaju.
Life is hard enough when we are well.	Aye ni lile to nigba ti a ba wa daradara.
I never took them.	Emi ko mu wọn rara.
The city has grown since then.	Ilu ti fẹ lati igba naa.
We will not play with our ears.	A o fi eti se ere.
One of them is really good.	Ọkan ninu wọn dara gaan.
The truth is the truth.	Otitọ ni otitọ.
I can't seem to figure it out.	Emi ko le dabi lati ro ero rẹ.
If you haven’t seen the game, you should.	Ti o ko ba ti ri ere, o yẹ.
The cause was a good one.	Awọn fa je kan ti o dara.
My book has a lot of history to live up to.	Iwe mi ni itan pupọ lati gbe soke si.
It takes some time to get used to them.	O gba akoko diẹ lati lo fun wọn.
Stop now!	Duro ni bayi!
It was about morning.	O je nipa owurọ.
Okay, let me tell you.	O dara, jẹ ki n sọ fun ọ.
I doubt anything will be in it.	Mo ṣiyemeji ohunkohun yoo wa ninu rẹ.
You only know that you have beaten, used up, done it.	O mọ nikan pe o ti lu, lo soke, ṣe ni.
Pretty much my opinion.	Lẹwa Elo mi ero.
There is not much space on the table.	Ko si aaye pupọ lori tabili.
Like a train on a track.	Bi ọkọ oju irin lori orin kan.
You know you want one.	O mọ pe o fẹ ọkan.
Now is your time.	Bayi o jẹ akoko tirẹ.
Know that it is too late.	Mọ pe o ti kọja pẹ ju.
But they are not the same.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii ṣe kanna.
Love is.	Ife ni.
We will do this.	A yoo ṣe eyi.
I am learning more about love every day.	Mo n kọ ẹkọ diẹ sii nipa ifẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Please join us for a drink.	Jọwọ da wa fun ohun mimu.
I just sat there.	Mo kan joko nibẹ.
I can believe.	Mo le gbagbọ.
But, better to your words, it doesn’t matter.	Ṣugbọn, dara si ọrọ rẹ, ko ni anfani.
But what if.	Sugbon ohun ti o ba ti.
I don’t know anyone else who can, but maybe they can.	Emi ko mọ ẹnikẹni miiran ti o le, ṣugbọn boya wọn le.
You want it to live one day at a time.	O fẹ ki o gbe ni ọjọ kan ni akoko kan.
Or maybe it is to help their children.	Tabi boya o jẹ lati ran awọn ọmọ wọn lọwọ.
I think it only needs time.	Mo ro pe o nilo akoko nikan.
Status quo.	Ipo iṣẹ.
It tells where you are walking.	O sọ ibi ti o rin.
You can learn something.	O le kọ ẹkọ nkankan.
I can't wait to see it.	Emi ko le duro lati wo i.
Some personal.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti ara ẹni.
He lost the love of his life.	O padanu ifẹ ti igbesi aye rẹ.
I think it is important.	Mo ro pe o jẹ pataki.
It took me a little longer.	O gba mi diẹ diẹ.
But maybe there is more to it.	Ṣugbọn boya o wa diẹ sii si.
I know everyone is very worried about that.	Mo mọ pe gbogbo eniyan ni aniyan pupọ nipa iyẹn.
Games have everything.	Awọn ere ni ohun gbogbo.
It seems unlikely that you read much of them.	O dabi pe ko ṣeeṣe pe o ka pupọ ninu wọn.
He certainly did not plan to stay inside.	O dajudaju ko gbero lati duro si inu.
You are not the first.	Iwọ kii ṣe akọkọ.
I have no plans to change my game.	Emi ko gbero lati yi ere mi pada.
Now we know that it does not take.	Bayi a mọ pe ko gba.
You have seen it.	O ti ri i.
He did not notice it.	Ko ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
I have come to tell you something.	Mo ti wa lati so fun o nkankan.
Simple devices work well.	Awọn ẹrọ ti o rọrun ṣiṣẹ daradara.
But that’s not the point about why we’re here.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe aaye nipa idi ti a fi wa nibi.
And you just see where your power lies.	Ati pe o kan rii ibiti agbara rẹ wa.
The suburbs have a lot of kids.	Awọn agbegbe ilu ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde.
This is my year to do one for them.	Eyi ni ọdun mi lati se ọkan fun wọn.
The children bathed in the river.	Awọn ọmọde wẹ ninu odo.
This cannot be.	Eyi ko le jẹ.
Not at all.	Ko ṣe rara.
Make the game complete.	Ṣe ere naa pari.
So they don’t, either.	Nitorina wọn ko ṣe, boya.
I will not let you.	Emi ko ni jẹ ki o.
He will help us.	Oun yoo ran wa lọwọ.
There it is.	O wa.
By the way, it is probably not wrong.	Nipa ọna, o ṣee ṣe ko ṣe aṣiṣe.
Others are new.	Awọn miiran jẹ tuntun.
He told me to wait.	O sọ fun mi lati duro.
So we have to find a way to it.	Nitorina a ni lati wa ọna kan si ọdọ rẹ.
No information about his brothers.	Ko si alaye nipa awọn arakunrin rẹ.
Although he did not know exactly what was going on.	Bi o ti jẹ pe ko mọ gaan boya ohunkohun n ṣẹlẹ.
It rises beautifully.	O ga soke lẹwa.
They want to sleep.	Wọn fẹ lati sun.
Ask them if they would like anything to drink.	Beere lọwọ wọn boya wọn yoo fẹ ohunkohun lati mu.
He has been living in this city for a long time.	O ti n gbe ni ilu yii ti pẹ ju.
But it is too late to change.	Ṣugbọn o ti pẹ pupọ lati yipada.
What we are seeing is that this is completely wrong.	Ohun ti a n rii ni pe eyi jẹ aṣiṣe patapata.
You busy.	O n ṣiṣẹ lọwọ.
But it is not enough to change the big picture.	Ṣugbọn ko to lati yi aworan nla pada.
No, more than that.	Rara, ju iyẹn lọ.
I know you are doing your best.	Mo mọ pe o n ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
I hate it, but it has to be.	Mo korira rẹ, ṣugbọn o ni lati ni.
However there was room for a man to stay there.	Sibẹsibẹ aaye wà fun ọkunrin kan lati duro nibẹ.
Are you looking for new places to work?	Ṣe o n wa awọn aaye tuntun lati ṣiṣẹ?
I am with the car.	Mo wa pẹlu ọkọ.
You, everyone.	Iwọ, gbogbo eniyan.
Arrangements made for the wedding.	Awọn eto ti a ṣe fun igbeyawo.
You need all the help you can get.	O nilo gbogbo iranlọwọ ti o le gba.
Everything in your home is important.	Gbogbo nkan ti o wa ninu ile rẹ jẹ pataki.
Give them what you need to buy these things.	Fun wọn ni ohun ti o ni lati ra nkan wọnyi.
Go see.	Lọ wo.
No one expects miracles.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o nireti awọn iṣẹ iyanu.
Surprise has to be key.	Iyalẹnu ni lati jẹ bọtini.
Wait for the bus, or you will miss it.	Duro fun ọkọ akero, tabi o yoo padanu rẹ.
I am a new program now.	Mo jẹ eto tuntun bayi.
They are coming for him, and soon.	Wọn n bọ fun u, ati laipẹ.
I think you are right on that.	Mo ro pe o tọ lori iyẹn.
Which is not what is happening.	Eyi ti kii ṣe ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
If you do, it will return the value for that key.	Ti o ba ṣe bẹ, yoo da iye pada fun bọtini yẹn.
He has no brother.	Ko ni arakunrin.
Here, people must not try to think, they must feel.	Nibi, eniyan ko gbọdọ gbiyanju lati ronu, o gbọdọ lero.
But that doesn’t sound like much as a fact, either.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko nifẹ pupọ bi otitọ, boya.
He saw two people in the car.	O ri eniyan meji ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
I did nothing for him at all.	Emi ko ṣe ohunkohun fun u rara.
She is very angry.	O binu pupọ.
Cost needed.	Iye owo ti nilo.
All found objects were used.	Gbogbo awọn nkan ti a rii ni a lo.
If you want something, it will.	Ti o ba fe nkankan, yoo ri.
Or even what it is.	Tabi paapaa ohun ti o jẹ.
There are many classes.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn kilasi wa.
Cut your hair.	Ge irun ori rẹ.
Just a day or two.	O kan ọjọ kan tabi meji.
They are completely wrong for themselves.	Wọn jẹ aṣiṣe patapata fun ara wọn.
They are on vacation.	Wọn wa ni isinmi.
He returned to his brother.	O pada fun arakunrin rẹ.
You know what it is like to lose money.	O mọ ohun ti o jẹ lati padanu owo.
It benefits the driver.	O ṣe anfani fun awakọ naa.
Not been there before either.	Ko ti wa nibẹ ṣaaju boya.
You have to keep working.	O ni lati tẹsiwaju ṣiṣẹ.
There is music and drinks.	Orin ati ohun mimu wa.
We hope to rent the house next year.	A nireti lati ya ile naa ni ọdun to nbọ.
No idea to ask her to eat.	Ko si ero lati beere lọwọ rẹ lati jẹun.
This place cannot be missed.	Ibi yi ko le padanu.
It is good to be angry if you lose.	O dara lati binu ti o ba padanu.
Obviously that is what must have happened.	O han gbangba pe iyẹn ni ohun ti gbọdọ ti ṣẹlẹ.
Nothing here, nothing.	Ko si nkankan nibi, ko si nkankan.
But stay there for a while.	Ṣugbọn duro nibẹ ni diẹ.
Not with me, of course.	Ko pẹlu mi, dajudaju.
I know you will come back.	Mo mọ pe iwọ yoo pada wa.
Sleeping classes.	Awọn kilasi ti n sun oorun.
The game went on.	Awọn ere si lọ lori.
You and your sister.	Iwọ ati arabinrin rẹ.
And you should not try to buy your love.	Ati pe ko yẹ ki o gbiyanju lati ra ifẹ rẹ.
That is my job.	Iṣẹ́ mi niyẹn.
It will work either way.	O yoo ṣiṣẹ boya ọna.
My body does the same.	Ara mi ṣe kanna.
I do not know what to say.	Emi ko mọ kini lati sọ rara.
He knew it could hurt, but he could not see.	O mọ pe o le ṣe ipalara, ṣugbọn o ko le wo.
So it breaks for us.	Nitorina o ṣe adehun fun wa.
I belong to a group.	Mo wa ninu ẹgbẹ kan.
Not an easy picture to take in my opinion.	Ko rọrun aworan lati ya ni ero mi.
There are good places to be the last of its kind.	Awọn aaye to dara wa lati jẹ ẹni ikẹhin ti iru rẹ.
This is a fact.	Eyi ni otitọ kan.
They have met several times after that to get out together.	Wọn ti pade ni ọpọlọpọ igba lẹhin iyẹn lati jade papọ.
The bed turned into something completely different.	Ibusun yipada si nkan miiran patapata.
He climbed into the room.	O gun wo inu yara naa.
You always write beautiful.	O nigbagbogbo kọ lẹwa.
I want to feel something.	Mo fe lati lero nkankan.
I will tell you now.	Emi yoo sọ fun ọ ni bayi.
The accident has changed the course of history.	Ijamba naa ti yi ọna itan pada.
Very powerful, that is.	Ni agbara pupọ, iyẹn.
I know what to do.	Mo mọ kini lati ṣe.
If we are with a girl, it does not work.	Ti a ba wa pẹlu ọmọbirin kan, ko ṣiṣẹ.
It has to be something right.	O ni lati jẹ nkan ti o tọ.
All if.	Gbogbo ti o ba.
But it is not my home.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ile mi.
But they did not laugh long.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko rẹrin gun.
We will hand them over.	A yoo fi le wọn lọwọ.
Inside, my eyes lifted.	Inu, oju mi ​​ti o gbe soke.
I do not need to.	Emi ko nilo lati.
Who are the two people in this picture?	Tani eniyan meji ninu aworan yii?
I have a baby at home.	Mo ni ọmọ kan ni ile.
If it is not hot, it is not hot.	Ti ko ba gbona, kii ṣe ooru.
Please listen carefully.	Jọwọ gbọ daradara.
You will have to start making your own ideas, he said.	Iwọ yoo ni lati bẹrẹ ṣiṣe awọn ero tirẹ, o sọ.
If you see a pocket opportunity, get it.	Ti o ba ri anfani apo, gba.
It becomes hard, just a little.	O di lile, o kan diẹ.
It is hard to lose a child.	O jẹ gidigidi lati padanu ọmọ.
I asked how long it had been there.	Mo beere bi o ti pẹ to ti o ti wa nibẹ.
Now it's time for me to say.	Bayi o to akoko fun mi lati sọ.
And back down.	Ati ki o pada si isalẹ.
I know a man.	Mo mọ ọkunrin kan.
She loves to work outside.	O nifẹ lati ṣiṣẹ ni ita.
Everyone knows each other so we are like a family.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ ara wọn nitori naa a dabi idile.
It has become his face.	O ti di oju rẹ.
They tried everything.	Wọn gbiyanju ohun gbogbo.
In your ear.	Ni eti rẹ.
Use the money is spent.	Lo owo ti wa ni owo lo.
Many were silenced.	Ọpọlọpọ ni wọn pa ẹnu mọ́.
Too early in the morning for hot water to go.	Ju ni kutukutu owurọ fun omi gbona lati lọ.
He lost an eye.	O padanu oju kan.
That they are not important at all.	Pe wọn ko ṣe pataki rara.
That seems to work well.	Iyẹn dabi pe o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
Say no to what you're seeing.	Sọ pe ko tọ pe o n rii.
She’s trying, but she’s already here.	O n gbiyanju, ṣugbọn o ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
You know the city better than I do.	O mọ ilu ju mi ​​lọ.
But there is nothing you can do.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o le ṣe.
I'm not sure.	Emi ko da mi loju.
Keep the same image in your mind.	Pa aworan kanna ni ọkan rẹ.
You do not understand any of this.	O ko loye eyikeyi ninu eyi.
Use it yourself and use it regularly.	Lo funrararẹ ati ki o lo nigbagbogbo.
He will think of me more in his way than ever.	Oun yoo ro mi diẹ sii ni ọna rẹ ju lailai.
Another day, another hour, another minute.	Ọjọ miiran, wakati miiran, iṣẹju miiran.
In the car.	Ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
Money still does not live as information.	Owo ṣi ko gbe bi alaye.
Maybe you can just laugh for no reason.	Boya o le kan rẹrin laisi idi kan.
I know my class.	Mo mọ kilasi mi.
They love me there.	Wọn fẹran mi nibẹ.
What we know to be true is not true.	Ohun ti a mọ lati jẹ otitọ kii ṣe otitọ.
For a few minutes he thought everything would go well.	Fun iṣẹju diẹ o ro pe gbogbo nkan yoo lọ.
There will be waiting for hours at a time.	Nibẹ ni yoo duro fun awọn wakati ni akoko kan.
Both stood still.	Awọn mejeeji duro duro.
That is not possible here.	Iyẹn ko ṣeeṣe nibi.
They are in me.	Wọn wa ninu mi.
Everything you take has a little time to decide.	Gbogbo ohun ti o gba ni akoko diẹ lati pinnu.
Anyone know how to do this.	Ẹnikẹni mọ bi o ṣe yẹ ki o ṣe eyi.
Even talking back.	Paapaa sọrọ pada.
Grow up or go under, my friend.	Dagba tabi lọ labẹ, ọrẹ mi.
Today, however, it has happened on their watch.	Loni, sibẹsibẹ, o ti ṣẹlẹ lori aago wọn.
I can't do this.	Emi ko le ṣe eyi.
It just can't happen.	O kan ko le ṣẹlẹ.
Love her, love her, love her.	Nifẹ rẹ, nifẹ rẹ, nifẹ rẹ.
You do too.	Iwọ tun ṣe.
Stay amazing, everyone !.	Duro iyanu, gbogbo eniyan!.
And they missed what the fathers did last night.	Ati pe wọn padanu ohun ti awọn baba ṣe ni alẹ.
When it’s over, it’s over.	Nigbati o ti pari, o ti pari.
I remember something he said, especially.	Mo ranti ohun kan ti o sọ, paapaa.
It seemed anxious.	O dabi enipe aniyan.
You are not a friend.	Iwọ kii ṣe ọrẹ.
This could be.	Eyi le jẹ.
A man has a better world.	Ọkunrin kan ni aye to dara julọ.
Kill their child too.	Pa ọmọ wọn paapaa.
It doesn't matter, you know.	Ko ṣe pataki, o mọ.
It makes me think of your mother.	O jẹ ki n ronu iya rẹ.
All the others are gone.	Gbogbo awọn miiran ti lọ.
You are more than them.	O ju wọn lọ.
That was a special moment for me.	Iyẹn jẹ akoko pataki fun mi.
That is the end of it.	Ipari rẹ niyẹn.
I’ll have to look back on that.	Emi yoo ni lati wo pada lori iyẹn.
I do not know the word.	Emi ko mọ ọrọ naa.
I will help you cook.	Emi yoo ran ọ lọwọ lati ṣe ounjẹ.
Again, someone saw you again, this time a sister.	Lẹẹkansi, ẹnikan tun rii ọ, ni akoko yii arabinrin kan.
Tea is a way of life.	Tii jẹ ọna igbesi aye.
It’s one on the word.	O jẹ ọkan lori ọrọ.
We are in the summer here.	A wa ninu ooru nibi.
It works great, everything works as it should.	O ṣiṣẹ nla, ohun gbogbo ṣiṣẹ bi o ti yẹ.
Can you lend me some money?	Ṣe o le ya mi ni owo diẹ?
Maybe you would consider a gift of such a nature.	Boya o yoo ronu ẹbun ti iru kan.
Remember, they know more about themselves than you do.	Ranti, wọn mọ diẹ sii nipa ara wọn ju iwọ lọ.
Of course it was.	Dajudaju o je.
A few people were sitting under the tree.	Awọn eniyan kekere kan joko labẹ igi naa.
The fact is.	Ohun to daju.
It may not be enough to go around.	Ko le jẹ pe ko to lati lọ ni ayika.
They can do it yourself, in a few minutes.	Wọn le ṣe funrararẹ, ni iṣẹju diẹ.
One of these is homeless.	Ọkan ninu awọn wọnyi ko ni ile.
However, given dates are not always accepted.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ọjọ ti a fun ko nigbagbogbo gba.
It is, or is trying to be, the tree.	O jẹ, tabi n gbiyanju lati jẹ, igi naa.
When he sat back at the table, he got up.	Nigbati o joko pada ni tabili, o dide.
However, methods can be called on the player.	Sibẹsibẹ, a le pe awọn ọna lori ẹrọ orin.
It takes a lot of hard work and money to produce.	O gba a pupo ti lile ise ati owo lati gbe awọn.
I say if you need that time, get it.	Mo sọ pe ti o ba nilo akoko yẹn, gba.
We have to lose the game.	A ni lati padanu ere naa.
And we don’t have a week.	Ati pe a ko ni ọsẹ kan.
That’s what a lot of people will buy into your ideas.	Iyẹn ni ọpọlọpọ eniyan yoo ra sinu awọn imọran rẹ.
That’s the best places.	Iyẹn ni awọn aaye to dara julọ.
He loves his work.	O fẹran iṣẹ rẹ.
Don't do that again.	Maṣe ṣe iyẹn lẹẹkansi.
It's also good.	O tun dara.
His eyes are all.	Oju rẹ jẹ gbogbo.
You can have any woman you want.	O le ni eyikeyi obinrin ti o fe.
I can not tell you the exact rules.	Emi ko le sọ fun ọ awọn ofin gaan.
He was already a student in high school.	O jẹ ọmọ ile-iwe tẹlẹ ni ile-iwe.
And we’ll talk about that a bit.	Ati pe a yoo sọrọ nipa iyẹn ni diẹ.
But the other three are not.	Ṣugbọn awọn mẹta miiran kii ṣe.
What anyone would like.	Ohun ti ẹnikẹni yoo fẹ.
I wanted to.	Mo ti fẹ.
I have to help them.	Mo gbọdọ ran wọn lọwọ.
Very good, he asked.	O dara pupọ, o beere lọwọ rẹ.
There is a lot to be around right now, especially.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ti o wa lati wa ni ayika ni bayi, paapaa.
Maybe that house isn’t all that important.	Boya ile yẹn kii ṣe gbogbo nkan ti o ṣe pataki.
We must learn to live together.	A gbọdọ kọ ẹkọ lati gbe papọ.
I did not ask to be.	Emi ko beere lati wa ni.
Very probably there was.	Gan jasi nibẹ wà.
He did not know whether it would be.	Ko mọ boya yoo jẹ.
She lost her mother and father.	O padanu iya ati baba rẹ.
It will help.	Yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.
They are not afraid and do not know.	Wọn ko bẹru ko si mọ.
I think in the end they are happy.	Mo ro pe ni ipari wọn dun.
Like many before me.	Bi ọpọlọpọ ṣaaju mi.
We cannot continue like this.	A ko le tẹsiwaju bi eleyi.
But if you come back here, we will kill you.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba pada wa nibi, a yoo pa ọ.
We have a lot of history behind us.	A ni ọpọlọpọ itan lẹhin wa.
You can also take a clean trip.	O tun le rin irin-ajo ti o mọ.
It felt good there a few years ago.	O ni imọran ti o dara nibẹ ni ọdun diẹ sẹhin.
About it but last time decided not to.	Nipa rẹ ṣugbọn ni akoko to kẹhin pinnu lati ma ṣe.
It has happened in the past, and will happen again in the future.	O ti ṣẹlẹ ni awọn ti o ti kọja, ati ki o yoo lẹẹkansi ni ojo iwaju.
There it is.	O wa.
But you have good days.	Ṣugbọn o ni awọn ọjọ ti o dara.
He could not tell her that.	Ko le so fun u pe.
She decided to start her new life here.	O pinnu lati bẹrẹ igbesi aye tuntun rẹ nibi.
It just can't happen.	O kan ko le ṣẹlẹ.
I was happy with how these came out.	Inu mi dun si bi awọn wọnyi ṣe jade.
I just have you.	Mo kan ni ọ.
You will not be able to recognize the old house anymore.	Iwọ kii yoo ni anfani lati da ile atijọ mọ.
They have become friends.	Wọn ti di ọrẹ.
I was very small.	Mo ti wà gan kekere.
We can call that.	A le pe iyẹn.
But, we can understand more about it.	Ṣugbọn, a le ni oye diẹ sii nipa rẹ.
This is a big issue.	Ọrọ nla ni eyi.
With the right eye.	Pẹlu oju ti o tọ.
Two weeks have passed since you received the letter.	Ọsẹ meji ti kọja lati igba ti o gba lẹta naa.
He also has hair.	O tun ni irun.
We do not believe.	A ko gbagbọ.
You do not have to do anything.	O ko ni lati ṣe nkan kan.
He asked us what was going on.	O beere lọwọ wa pe kini o n ṣẹlẹ.
Two girls and a boy.	Awọn ọmọbirin meji ati ọmọkunrin kan.
They know this.	Wọn mọ eyi.
And a little under his eyes.	Ati diẹ labẹ oju rẹ.
His whole body was hurt, especially his head.	Gbogbo ara rẹ ni ipalara, paapaa ori rẹ.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	O fi idi rẹ han pe ko pe.
I don’t remember that, but we might as well.	Emi ko ranti iyẹn, ṣugbọn a le ni daradara.
Only he is your friend.	Nikan o jẹ ọrẹ rẹ yii.
After the train left, he left.	Lẹhin ti ọkọ oju irin naa ti lọ, o lọ.
What, is.	Kini, ni.
None of them hurt anything he did.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o ṣe ipalara ohunkohun ti o ṣe.
We know about it.	A mọ nipa rẹ.
Children and their families will be here around one this afternoon.	Awọn ọmọde ati awọn idile wọn yoo wa nibi ni ayika ọkan ni ọsan yii.
He did not say where.	Ko sọ ibi ti.
Forget about the whole thing.	Gbagbe nipa gbogbo ọrọ naa.
I just saw that.	Mo kan rii iyẹn.
No one has come home yet.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa si ile sibẹsibẹ.
I don't want one.	Emi ko fẹ ọkan.
You should have gone with it.	O yẹ ki o ti lọ pẹlu rẹ.
Error is less visible.	Aṣiṣe jẹ kere si han.
For you and others.	Fun iwọ ati awọn miiran.
This includes all other strings.	Eyi pẹlu gbogbo awọn okun miiran.
You look up and down the streets.	O wo soke ati isalẹ awọn ita.
So it comes to you.	Nitorina o wa si ọ.
So if you want, let the music begin.	Nitorina ti o ba fẹ, jẹ ki orin naa bẹrẹ.
We hope to miss a lot of time.	A nireti lati padanu ọpọlọpọ awọn akoko.
You never know.	O ti ko mọ.
And we must.	Ati pe a gbọdọ.
And I don’t believe I can pull it off.	Ati pe Emi ko gbagbọ pe MO le fa kuro.
You may have another one.	O le ni ọkan miiran.
Maybe this takes the first down.	Boya eyi n gba akọkọ si isalẹ.
They are also looking for us.	Wọn tun n wa wa.
I want to know.	Mo fẹ lati mọ.
That's very good.	Iyẹn dara pupọ.
They are too fast.	Wọn yara ju.
Apply for personal area.	Kan fun agbegbe ti ara ẹni.
Therefore, they are not important to each other.	Nitorina, wọn ko ṣe pataki si ara wọn.
At least that’s what you understand.	O kere ju iyẹn ni ohun ti o loye.
I have an area.	Mo ni agbegbe kan.
I don’t know how long this holiday will last.	Emi ko mọ bi isinmi yii yoo ṣe pẹ to.
Another three hours have passed.	Awọn wakati mẹta miiran ti kọja.
It’s not just about the sea.	Kii ṣe nipa okun nikan.
It’s more about love and wisdom.	O jẹ diẹ sii nipa ifẹ ati awọn ọgbọn.
It didn’t take much for his desire to come back.	Ko gba pupọ fun ifẹ rẹ lati tun pada.
People are always telling us.	Awọn eniyan n sọ fun wa nigbagbogbo.
But you have seen me.	Ṣugbọn o ti ri mi.
He was in the same boat.	O wa ninu ọkọ oju omi kanna.
This city is known for its art galleries.	Ilu yii ni a mọ fun awọn ibi aworan aworan rẹ.
I didn’t notice that.	Emi ko ṣe akiyesi iyẹn.
One never recorded.	Ọkan ko gba silẹ.
Dad wouldn’t say such a thing.	Baba ko ni sọ iru nkan bẹẹ.
They don’t want me around.	Wọn ko fẹ mi ni ayika.
There are many big factories in this city.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile-iṣẹ nla wa ni ilu yii.
If it does not appear, do not pull the trigger.	Ti ko ba han, ma ṣe fa nkan naa.
I think we will.	Mo ro pe a yoo.
One of these houses returns to where they removed a tree.	Ọkan ninu awọn ile wọnyi pada si ibi ti wọn gbe igi kan kuro.
But no one wants to.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹ.
You can see them but they cannot see it.	O le ri wọn ṣugbọn wọn ko le ri i.
He stopped and came to me.	O duro o si wa si mi.
I was there.	Mo wa nibẹ.
Maybe they still believe things like that about you, especially.	Boya wọn tun gbagbọ awọn nkan bii iyẹn nipa rẹ, paapaa.
You can not turn to him in the last days.	O ko le yipada si i ni awọn ọjọ ikẹhin.
I never lost sight of that.	Emi ko padanu oju iyẹn.
I am not affected by my public power at all.	Ko kan mi ni agbara gbangba mi rara.
They knew where we were going to go.	Wọn mọ ibi ti a yoo ni lati lọ.
Parents with their children.	Awọn obi pẹlu awọn ọmọ wọn.
You think you know what they are doing.	O ro pe o mọ ohun ti wọn n ṣe.
Time, end story.	Akoko, ipari itan.
He won't be wearing it now.	Oun ko ni wọ ni bayi.
Music is so fun that it repeats itself in so many ways.	Orin jẹ ohun ti o dun ni pe o tun ṣe ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna.
He was just a man.	O je o kan kan eniyan.
Once he told me he loved to swim.	Ni kete ti o sọ fun mi pe o nifẹ lati we.
You know, it’s not the book that is on the real test.	O mọ, kii ṣe iwe naa ti o wa lori idanwo gaan.
You can decide what is best for you.	O le pinnu ohun ti o dara julọ fun ọ.
They continue to walk by boat upstairs.	Wọn tẹsiwaju lati rin nipasẹ ọkọ oju omi si oke.
There is not much time left for me.	Ko si akoko pupọ ti o ku fun mi.
These and much more.	Awọn wọnyi ati pupọ diẹ sii.
This has to be important, because not everyone has them.	Eyi ni lati ṣe pataki, nitori kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan ni wọn.
I did not see until after.	Emi ko ri titi lẹhin.
That is the opinion of some who view this.	Iyẹn ni ero diẹ ninu awọn ti o wo eyi.
Only friends at home.	Ọrẹ nikan ni ile.
It was money to play with the big boys.	O jẹ owo lati mu ṣiṣẹ pẹlu awọn ọmọkunrin nla.
It pulls my legs.	O n fa ẹsẹ mi.
Until we meet again.	Titi a o fi tun pade.
I need this marriage to work.	Mo nilo igbeyawo yii lati ṣiṣẹ.
Or maybe they can’t even say what it is.	Tabi boya wọn ko le paapaa sọ ohun ti o jẹ.
He began to write.	O bẹrẹ lati kọ.
I can't stop.	Nko le da duro.
You get yourself up there and see for yourself.	O gba ara rẹ soke nibẹ ki o si ri fun ara rẹ.
But it was him.	Sugbon o je rẹ.
You need to cut off your ear to hear the music.	O nilo lati ge eti rẹ lati gbọ orin naa.
The same kind of people stop there.	Awọn iru eniyan kanna da duro nibẹ.
You know how to do that, a lot of things.	O mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe bẹ, ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
Line up.	Eto.
Police began searching the area.	Awọn ọlọpa bẹrẹ lati wa agbegbe agbegbe naa.
She is an open woman.	O jẹ obinrin ti o ṣi silẹ.
No one said anything, he said to himself.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ohunkohun, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
I can read on your face like a book.	Mo le ka lori oju rẹ bi iwe.
Not that, of course.	Ko pe, dajudaju.
I went to my room.	Mo lọ si yara mi.
He took the thing as it was.	O mu nkan naa bi o ti jẹ.
That is what it is called.	Ohun ti o pe niyẹn.
That may not be so.	Iyẹn le ma jẹ bẹ.
Nothing changes if not changed.	Ko si ohun ti o yipada ti ko ba yipada.
It seems all over again.	O dabi pe gbogbo lẹẹkansi.
What is clear is that something has changed.	Ohun ti o han ni pe ohun kan ti yipada.
This is our life and we love what we do.	Eyi ni igbesi aye wa ati pe a nifẹ ohun ti a ṣe.
And I don't think it went well.	Ati Emi ko ro pe o lọ daradara.
Nothing to plan.	Ko si ohun ti o le gbero.
I try to put myself in their place.	Mo gbiyanju lati fi ara mi si aaye wọn.
I need a book to clear my head.	Mo nilo iwe lati ko ori mi kuro.
A few months.	Oṣu diẹ.
This holiday will be an amazing holiday.	Isinmi yii yoo jẹ isinmi ti iyalẹnu.
Some words may do so.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọrọ le ṣe bẹ.
I did not buy.	Emi ko ra.
I really hope you enjoy it.	Mo nireti gaan pe o le gbadun rẹ.
In fact, it is.	Ni otitọ, o jẹ.
Maybe you will meet someone amazing, or maybe you will make some great friends.	Boya o yoo pade ẹnikan iyanu, tabi boya o yoo ṣe diẹ ninu awọn nla awọn ọrẹ.
Which should be enough.	Eyi ti o yẹ ki o to.
She has a lot of her mother in her.	O ni pupọ julọ ti iya rẹ ninu rẹ.
It seems to be yours.	O dabi pe o jẹ tirẹ.
Let all your friends read.	Jẹ ki gbogbo awọn ọrẹ rẹ ka.
I hate primary school.	Mo korira ile-iwe akọkọ.
We are not strong.	A ko ni okun.
I started laughing.	Mo bẹrẹ si rẹrin.
But he knew he had to try.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe o ni lati gbiyanju.
He completely rejected me.	O kọ mi silẹ patapata.
I do not mean what you think.	Emi ko tumọ si ohun ti o ro.
Get plenty of water.	Gba omi pupọ.
He was a very good student.	O jẹ ọmọ ile-iwe ti o dara pupọ.
You, they do not notice, because they understand your work.	Iwọ, wọn ko ṣe akiyesi, nitori wọn loye iṣẹ rẹ.
It also made me angry.	O tun mu mi binu.
That has changed with time.	Iyẹn ti yipada pẹlu akoko.
No words here.	Ko si awọn ọrọ nibi.
Tell them you love them and that everything will be fine.	Sọ fun wọn pe o nifẹ wọn ati pe ohun gbogbo yoo dara.
It is in it.	O wa ninu rẹ.
Their ideas are important to us.	Awọn imọran wọn ṣe pataki fun wa.
Left to do all the work alone.	Ti fi silẹ lati ṣe gbogbo iṣẹ nikan.
They need to stay together.	Wọn nilo lati duro papọ.
But since then, it has taken over my home and life.	Ṣugbọn lati igba naa, o ti gba ile ati igbesi aye mi.
My thing is running.	Nkan mi ni ṣiṣe.
We wanted to do this.	A ti fẹ lati ṣe eyi.
I feel that may not be enough.	Mo lero wipe o ko le jẹ to.
I can't think of everyone.	Emi ko le ronu fun gbogbo eniyan.
Please wash your hands before meals.	Jọwọ, wẹ ọwọ rẹ ṣaaju akoko ounjẹ.
There are no tests.	Ko si awọn idanwo.
Local can use them.	Agbegbe le lo wọn.
I remember sitting at the bar and drinking.	Mo ranti joko ni igi ati mimu.
Worth a Stop.	Tọ a Duro.
It has not improved.	O ti ko dara si.
And even that is good.	Ati paapaa iyẹn dara.
I tried a lot but it ran out early.	Mo gbiyanju pupọ ṣugbọn o sare jade ni kutukutu.
I do not think to ask you about this.	Emi ko ronu lati beere lọwọ rẹ nipa eyi.
Children learn vocabulary at this school.	Awọn ọmọde kọ ẹkọ ọrọ ni ile-iwe yii.
You have to go.	O ni lati lọ.
It doesn’t seem to lift you up or anything.	Ko dabi pe o gbe ọ ga tabi ohunkohun.
It will be hard for a long time.	Yoo jẹ lile fun igba pipẹ.
Good in words.	O dara ni awọn ọrọ.
I am also one of the 'us'.	Mo tun jẹ ọkan ninu 'wa'.
That could be.	Iyẹn le jẹ.
She was afraid he would not let her eat.	O bẹru pe ko jẹ ki o jẹ ki o jẹ.
Not there, of course.	Ko si nibẹ, dajudaju.
That should not be there.	Iyẹn ko yẹ ki o wa nibẹ.
Your parents hope you get a good job.	Awọn obi rẹ nireti pe ki o gba iṣẹ to dara.
And this should not come as a surprise.	Ati pe eyi ko yẹ ki o wa bi iyalẹnu.
Both are everywhere.	Awọn mejeeji wa ni ibi gbogbo.
You can't stop it, so you can't stop it.	O ko le da a mọ, nitorina ko le da a duro.
Maybe by this time he was gone.	Boya ni akoko yii o ti lọ.
Get who you are, and rejoice in it.	Gba ẹni ti o jẹ, ki o si yọ ninu rẹ.
I don't want your call already.	Emi ko fẹ pe rẹ tẹlẹ.
To get a job you have to let people know who you are.	Lati gba iṣẹ kan o ti jẹ ki awọn eniyan mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
So we get three ways.	Nitorina a gba awọn ọna mẹta.
I am always with my mother.	Mo wa pẹlu iya mi nigbagbogbo.
There were no dogs at the first class meeting.	Ko si awọn aja ni ipade kilasi akọkọ.
The door is always open.	Ilẹkun nigbagbogbo ṣi silẹ.
It must have been stolen on the table.	O gbọdọ ti ji lori tabili.
Get away from me! 	Lọ kuro mi!
Not on track either.	Kii ṣe lori orin boya.
We know how to do better than anyone else.	A mọ bi a ṣe le ṣe daradara ju ẹnikẹni lọ.
I work at least an hour every morning.	Mo ṣiṣẹ ni o kere ju wakati kan ni gbogbo owurọ.
I stayed the longest.	Mo duro ni gun julọ.
At least a few.	O kere ju diẹ.
My father is in it.	Baba mi wa ninu rẹ.
Our ancestors once lived here.	Awọn baba wa nigba kan ti gbe nibi.
He agreed to the proposal.	O gba si imọran naa.
You need it now.	O nilo ni bayi.
This is of course not true.	Eyi ti dajudaju kii ṣe otitọ.
It will be fine.	Yoo dara.
It also means.	O tun tumọ si.
It looks like it's working.	O dabi ẹni pe o n ṣiṣẹ.
They give us some money.	Owo diẹ ni wọn fun wa.
On the same day a new accident happened.	Ni ọjọ kanna ijamba tuntun kan ṣẹlẹ.
Some love it.	Diẹ ninu awọn nifẹ rẹ.
You don’t get much talking.	O ko gba Elo sọrọ.
He said so himself.	O sọ bẹ funrararẹ.
Could not be true.	Ko le ṣee jẹ otitọ.
This has not happened for a long time here.	Eyi ko tii ṣẹlẹ fun igba pipẹ nibi.
Maybe something like that.	Boya awọn nkan kan dabi iyẹn.
He has a great love for his wife and children.	O ni ife nla fun iyawo ati awọn ọmọ rẹ.
This will cause a problem.	Eyi yoo fa iṣoro kan.
It has done so much for me.	O ti ṣe pupọ fun mi.
There is no reason for you to be angry.	Ko si idi fun ọ lati binu.
Stay here if you want.	Duro nibi ti o ba fẹ.
We refuse to do so here.	A kọ lati ṣe bẹ nibi.
That shouldn’t happen for another month.	Iyẹn ko yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ fun oṣu miiran.
Not sure what happened to them.	Ko daju ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si wọn.
She worked at a surprise school.	O ṣiṣẹ ni ile-iwe iyalẹnu.
You want something better.	O fẹ nkankan dara.
He seems to be not afraid at all.	O dabi pe ko bẹru rara.
This is going to take forever.	Eleyi ti wa ni lilọ lati ya lailai.
He understood that for years.	O loye iyẹn fun awọn ọdun.
Do not deal with companies like that.	Maṣe ṣe pẹlu ile-iṣẹ bii iyẹn.
Please do not tell me there are simple ways to do it.	Jọwọ maṣe sọ fun mi pe awọn ọna ti o rọrun wa lati ṣe.
I will not give this to anyone.	Emi yoo ko fi eyi fun ẹnikẹni.
Can anyone tell me the best way to do this.	Njẹ ẹnikan le sọ fun mi ọna ti o dara julọ lati ṣe eyi.
I am not afraid of a man.	Emi ko bẹru ọkunrin kan.
He stood there.	O duro nibẹ.
I find we have come a long way since then.	Mo rii pe a ti wa ọna pipẹ lati igba naa.
You have to leave us.	O ni lati fi wa silẹ.
But it is not a final agreement.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe adehun ti o pari.
It will make you feel better.	Yoo jẹ ki ara rẹ dara.
Many children still wear these outfits.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde ṣi wọ awọn aṣọ wọnyi.
Both have small children.	Awọn mejeeji ni awọn ọmọde kekere.
They are in a kind of stress.	Wọn wa ninu iru wahala kan.
He drank more.	O mu ounjẹ diẹ sii.
It is worthwhile to know these people.	O jẹ ohun ti o tọ lati mọ awọn eniyan wọnyi.
He slept in a small backyard.	O sun ninu ile kekere ti o wa lẹhin ile.
Most women are aware of such.	Pupọ julọ awọn obinrin ni o mọ iru iru bẹẹ.
He picked up a book.	O gbe iwe kan.
They will go home.	Wọn yoo lọ si ile.
I learned from them.	Mo kọ kuro lati wọn.
They are good to eat.	Wọn dara lati jẹun.
His thoughts about his father.	Awọn ero rẹ nipa baba rẹ.
More to give.	Diẹ sii lati fun.
I can not tell.	Nko le so fun.
That is my family.	Idile mi niyen.
I know it will be good.	Mo mọ pe yoo dara.
It is very hot today.	O gbona gan loni.
So give it a try.	Nitorina fun ki o dara.
Take their ideas seriously.	Mu ero wọn ni pataki.
Time to go home.	Akoko lati lọ si ile.
I like to pick up words and send them manually.	Mo nifẹ lati mu awọn ọrọ mu ati fi wọn ranṣẹ pẹlu ọwọ.
They are able to work long hours.	Wọn ni anfani lati ṣiṣẹ ni pipẹ.
He is in excellent condition.	O wa ni ipo ti o dara julọ.
Nothing else now.	Ko si ohun miiran ni bayi.
They have a key.	Won ni bọtini kan.
They talked for an hour.	Wọn ti sọrọ fun wakati kan.
He then ended up back at the bar.	O si ki o si pari soke pada ni igi.
Consciously they remain in power until it is removed.	Ni imọran wọn wa ni agbara titi ti o fi yọ kuro.
He said it was.	O sọ pe o jẹ.
I am here to help.	Mo wa nibi lati ran.
History as we know it is over.	Itan bi a ti mọ pe o ti pari.
I can tell from your eyes.	Mo le sọ lati oju rẹ.
However, let me give you a piece of information.	Sibẹsibẹ, jẹ ki n fun ọ ni nkan kan ti alaye.
And we do with one.	Ati pe a ṣe pẹlu ọkan.
You are not invited.	Iwọ ko pe.
He has power.	O ni agbara.
O fe e.	O fe e.
He’s just an amazing person.	O kan jẹ eniyan iyalẹnu.
That bus stopped several times.	Ọkọ akero yẹn duro ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
Not that he didn’t know this, but he got it from him.	Kii ṣe pe ko mọ eyi, ṣugbọn o ni i lati ọdọ rẹ.
'hands.	' ọwọ.
It is only important that they are there.	O ṣe pataki nikan pe wọn wa nibẹ.
Something is wrong.	Nkankan jẹ aṣiṣe pupọ.
You can understand the idea behind that.	O le ni oye ero lẹhin iyẹn.
You understand your own ability to be more than good.	O ni oye agbara tirẹ lati jẹ diẹ sii ju dara julọ.
It was very small when I had.	O jẹ kekere pupọ nigbati mo ni.
At night he opened the door to his companions.	Ni alẹ o ṣi ilẹkun si awọn ẹgbẹ rẹ.
I never thought there was much to it, he said.	Emi ko ti ro pe o wa pupọ si i, o sọ.
I used to stop and try and learn.	Mo lo lati duro ati gbiyanju ati kọ ẹkọ.
Our friends dropped by day and night.	Awọn ọrẹ wa silẹ ni ọsan ati alẹ.
Notice everything you do.	Ṣe akiyesi ohun gbogbo ti o ṣe.
I would be happy to.	Inu mi yoo dun lati.
Their teachings are flawed with errors.	Awọn ẹkọ wọn ni awọn aṣiṣe pẹlu awọn aṣiṣe.
Such has been the case.	Iru bẹẹ ti jẹ bẹẹ.
Locals are angry that they have been forgotten.	Awọn ara agbegbe n binu pe wọn ti gbagbe wọn.
Will use again.	Yoo tun lo lẹẹkansi.
She is not a mother at all.	Oun kii ṣe iya rara.
I help, of course.	Mo ṣe iranlọwọ, dajudaju.
You can say that again, and again.	O le sọ iyẹn lẹẹkansi, ati lẹẹkansi.
It's the kind of thing you've never heard of before.	O jẹ iru nkan ti o ko tii gbọ rara.
I do not, perhaps.	Emi ko, boya.
This is the first.	Eyi jẹ akọkọ.
Call it the way.	Pe e ni ọna.
Just give them what they want.	Kan fun wọn ni ohun ti wọn fẹ.
The year started well.	Odun bẹrẹ daradara.
I'm sure my flight will be long,	Mo da mi loju pe ọkọ ofurufu mi yoo pẹ,
Injuries hurt their interests.	Awọn ipalara ṣe ipalara awọn anfani wọn.
That’s what we’ve seen.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti a ti rii.
Does your husband say that about my work?	Ọkọ rẹ sọ ọrọ yẹn nipa iṣẹ mi?
Our garden is smaller than theirs.	Ọgba wa kere ju ti wọn.
It just happened that way.	O kan ṣẹlẹ ni ọna yẹn.
That I was alone and trying to live my life.	Iyẹn jẹ Emi nikan ni emi ati gbiyanju lati gbe igbesi aye mi.
But we know, when you leave, that you will return.	Ṣugbọn a mọ, nigbati o ba lọ, pe iwọ yoo pada.
Those who do not have this lose a great deal of time.	Awọn ti ko ni eyi n padanu akoko nla.
They just know the game.	Wọn kan mọ ere naa.
There is no wrong word to say about anyone.	Ko ni ọrọ ti ko tọ lati sọ nipa ẹnikẹni.
Both walked towards the street.	Awọn mejeeji rin si ọna ita.
They are interesting as well.	Awon ni awon bi daradara.
I'm on the way down.	Mo wa ni ọna isalẹ.
That's what he did.	Ohun ti o ṣe niyẹn.
And mother and father as well.	Ati iya ati baba pẹlu.
I mean zero.	Mo tumọ si odo.
This is bad.	Eleyi je buburu.
I do not expect.	Emi ko reti.
We need two observations.	A nilo awọn akiyesi meji.
I already have money.	Mo ti ni owo tẹlẹ.
You need money.	O nilo owo.
I think we understand.	Mo ro pe a ni oye.
It was a great job, but of course not an impossible one.	O jẹ iṣẹ nla, ṣugbọn dajudaju kii ṣe ọkan ti ko ṣeeṣe.
People need to know what happened.	Awọn eniyan nilo lati mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Liquid can be obtained.	Omi oju le ṣee gba.
This is a for sure purchase.	Eleyi jẹ kan fun daju ra.
And for your dog.	Ati fun aja rẹ.
My services will come.	Awọn iṣẹ mi yoo wa.
You already have.	O ti ni.
This is not always possible.	Eyi ti ko ṣee ṣe nigbagbogbo.
Good enough to eat.	O dara to lati jẹun.
But that is too late for history to tell now.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ti pẹ ju itan lati sọ ni bayi.
They are at work until they close the position.	Wọn wa ni iṣẹ titi ti wọn fi pa ipo naa.
It must be removed.	O gbọdọ yọ kuro.
But of course, it will not be there.	Ṣugbọn dajudaju, ko ni wa nibẹ.
And he went out.	O si jade si ita.
Get out of the boats.	Lọ kuro ninu awọn ọkọ oju omi.
This is so for several reasons.	Eyi jẹ bẹ fun awọn idi pupọ.
Others may not like this method.	Awọn miiran le ma fẹran ọna yii.
You’re not going to miss the deadline, are you?	Iwọ kii yoo padanu akoko ipari, ṣe iwọ?
Up and down through the hours, days.	Si oke ati isalẹ nipasẹ awọn wakati, awọn ọjọ.
Find someone you love and who you love back.	Wa ẹnikan ti o nifẹ ati ẹniti o nifẹ rẹ pada.
Use your best clothes.	Lo aṣọ rẹ ti o dara julọ.
My son taught me to love him.	Ọmọ mi kọ mi lati fẹran rẹ.
I feel like a child again.	Mo lero bi ọmọde lẹẹkansi.
It asked for a few minutes of my time.	O beere fun iṣẹju diẹ ti akoko mi.
Not sure what caused it because everything was already fine.	Ko daju ohun ti o fa nitori ohun gbogbo ti dara tẹlẹ.
You know how it is.	O mọ bi o ṣe jẹ.
But see what happens in the next few years.	Ṣugbọn wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni awọn ọdun diẹ ti nbọ.
That's what they wore.	Ohun ti wọn wọ niyẹn.
Let's go into town.	Jẹ ká lọ sinu ilu.
You will be allowed.	Iwọ yoo gba ọ laaye.
There is no water.	Ko si omi.
I don’t think anyone will.	Emi ko ro pe ẹnikẹni yoo.
This method has no methods.	Ọna yii ko ni awọn ọna.
Not as easy as you think.	Ko rọrun bi o ṣe ro.
She knew she was beautiful and lived that way.	O mọ pe o lẹwa ati ki o gbe ni ọna yẹn.
Do something about them.	Ṣe nkankan nipa wọn.
But today, they will be.	Ṣugbọn loni, wọn yoo jẹ.
I don’t think it has ever been beautiful.	Emi ko ro pe o ti lẹwa lailai.
He has power over us.	O ni agbara lori wa.
Neither of these worked for me.	Bẹni ninu awọn wọnyi ko ṣiṣẹ fun mi.
Soon they realized something was wrong.	Laipẹ wọn mọ pe ohun kan ko tọ.
He obviously could not stand it anymore.	O han gbangba pe ko le duro mọ.
Okay, let’s finish the matter.	O dara, jẹ ki a pari ọrọ naa.
I have not bought anything.	Emi ko ti ra ohunkohun.
Do not be afraid.	Maṣe bẹru.
It will not.	Kii yoo ṣe.
He felt high of himself.	O ro ga ti ara rẹ.
And this continues for the whole game.	Ati pe eyi n tẹsiwaju fun gbogbo ere naa.
Does this really need to be cut?	Ṣe eyi nilo lati ge ni otitọ?
I do not want to use.	Emi ko fẹ lati lo.
I started to wonder what it takes so long.	Mo bẹrẹ lati ṣe iyalẹnu kini o n gba to gun.
Keep doing this for several weeks.	Pa ṣiṣe eyi fun awọn ọsẹ pupọ.
There are three problems here.	Awọn iṣoro mẹta wa nibi.
This cannot happen again.	Eyi ko le ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
Play with your story.	Mu ṣiṣẹ pẹlu itan rẹ.
It is best to keep this to yourself.	O dara julọ lati tọju eyi si ọkan.
Get this box.	Gba apoti yii.
He could not help himself.	Ko le ran ara rẹ lọwọ.
You need to take care of yourself.	O nilo lati tọju ara rẹ.
You can even walk.	O le paapaa rin.
Nothing sound.	Ko si ohun ohun.
She has a few problems and is trying to get better.	O ni awọn iṣoro diẹ ati pe o n gbiyanju lati dara.
I did not try to move.	Emi ko gbiyanju lati gbe.
I remember it, however.	Mo ranti rẹ, sibẹsibẹ.
Children are one family.	Awọn ọmọde jẹ ọkan ti idile kan.
Not what they are saying.	Kii ṣe ohun ti wọn n sọ.
I will not let that happen to you.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ si ọ.
It is too late for me to change.	O ti pẹ ju fun mi lati yipada.
I see it.	Mo wo o.
I'm going up.	Mo n lọ soke.
Cannot be applied to it.	Ko le ṣee lo si i.
Of course, the first day went by.	Dajudaju, ọjọ akọkọ ti o lọ.
We have seen, however, that two reasons stand out.	A ti rii, sibẹsibẹ, pe awọn idi meji duro jade.
He is learning to be a doctor.	O n kọ ẹkọ lati jẹ dokita.
In this program.	Ninu eto yi.
Here, there, and everywhere.	Nibi, nibẹ, ati nibi gbogbo.
I will go for several days.	Emi yoo lọ ni ọpọlọpọ ọjọ.
Just want to tell me in person.	O kan fẹ sọ fun mi ni eniyan.
I have a lot to work with.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
I never gave him a chance.	Emi ko fun u ni aye rara.
Once it started, no one thought it could stop.	Ni kete ti o bẹrẹ, ko si ẹnikan ti o ro pe o le da.
We are near the train station.	A wa nitosi ibudo ọkọ oju irin.
His mother said.	Iya rẹ sọ.
So his father loved his mother.	Nitorina baba rẹ fẹ iya rẹ.
There is still so much to learn.	Pupọ wa ti a tun ni lati kọ.
Did he or his parents try to.	Njẹ oun tabi awọn obi rẹ gbiyanju lati.
Both are the only ones.	Awọn mejeeji nikan ni.
We want some both.	A fẹ diẹ ninu awọn mejeeji.
At that moment, an idea came to me.	Ni akoko yẹn, ero kan wa si mi.
Nice to see you.	O dara lati ri ọ.

But he was afraid to say anything.	Ṣugbọn o bẹru lati sọ ohunkohun.
I need it for reasons.	Mo nilo rẹ fun awọn idi.
It worked because it was said to work.	O ṣiṣẹ nitori a sọ pe o ṣiṣẹ.
But something not so good is something else happening.	Ṣugbọn ohun ti ko bẹ daradara ni ohun miiran ṣẹlẹ.
Nothing for the days after us.	Ko si nkankan fun awọn ọjọ lẹhin wa.
Of course he came back to her.	Dajudaju o pada si ọdọ rẹ.

At least he's trying.	O kere o n gbiyanju.
Now it has always been, and always will always be.	Bayi ni o ti wa nigbagbogbo, ati boya nigbagbogbo yoo jẹ.
That will let you move.	Ti o yoo jẹ ki o gbe.

I have been using it for many years.	Mo ti n lo fun ọdun pupọ.

You will have to proceed with that well.	Iwọ yoo ni lati tẹsiwaju pẹlu iyẹn daradara.
I can still get money for it.	Mo tun le gba owo fun rẹ.
I'm glad you don't understand what's going on.	Inu mi dun pe o ko loye ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
It is something special.	O jẹ nkan pataki.
Someone like that.	Ẹnikan bi iyẹn.
It’s a matter of where you start from.	O jẹ ọrọ ti ibiti o ti bẹrẹ lati.
Three brothers in a row.	Awọn arakunrin mẹta ni ọna kan.
It is a really good book.	O jẹ iwe ti o dara gaan.
If you can kill it.	Ti o ba jẹ pe o le pa a.
If you have one of these, send it to me.	Ti o ba ni ọkan ninu awọn wọnyi, fi ranṣẹ si mi.
I should have grown now to know better.	Mo yẹ ki o ti dagba ni bayi lati mọ dara julọ.
These shoes are too small.	Awọn bata wọnyi kere ju.
Not bad.	Ko ṣe buburu.
This child will not learn to read or write.	Ọmọ yii kii yoo kọ ẹkọ lati ka tabi kọ.
What it must have been for my father to accept.	Kini ohun ti o gbọdọ jẹ fun baba mi lati gba.

And they have not changed.	Ati pe wọn ko yipada.
Soon made it to the books.	Laipẹ ṣe o si awọn iwe.
And he wants you to sit with him.	O si fẹ ki o joko pẹlu rẹ.
It can be anyone.	O le jẹ ẹnikẹni.
You don’t even need to touch it, just.	Ko paapaa nilo lati fi ọwọ kan rẹ, o kan.
Worth a try.	Tọ a gbiyanju.
And here you can leave me.	Ati nibi o le fi mi silẹ.
Put him to bed now!	Fi fun u si ibusun ni bayi!
Please make yourself at home.	Jọwọ ṣe ara rẹ ni ile.
I live it.	Mo n gbe e.
And it’s worth doubting me.	Ati pe o tọ lati ṣiyemeji mi.
Now there is no one to call.	Bayi ko si ẹnikan lati pe.
They have nothing to do with each other.	Wọn ko ni nkankan ṣe pẹlu ara wọn.
Baby, kids!	Bayi, yara!
I talked to my children a long time last night.	Mo ti ba awọn ọmọ mi sọrọ pipẹ ni alẹ ana.
Stay in the car.	Duro ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
How good they are.	Bawo ni wọn ṣe dara to.
It starts to cut.	O bẹrẹ lati ge.
Contact you.	Kan si o.
And no one told us.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ fun wa.
It is not their intention.	Kii ṣe ipinnu wọn.
He had made a bed before, he thought.	O ti ṣe ibusun ṣaaju ki o to, o ro.
It is all over the house.	O wa lori gbogbo ile.
Just enter the house.	O kan wọ ile.
What a great city it is.	Kini ilu nla ti o jẹ.
Tell myself when to wake up.	Sọ fun ara mi nigbati lati ji.
These words are usually spoken by a man.	Awọn ọrọ wọnyi ni a maa n sọ nipasẹ ọkunrin kan.
But not yet.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe sibẹsibẹ.
Use that to your advantage !.	Lo iyẹn si anfani rẹ!.
I can't wait to read what you think about your own time.	Emi ko le duro lati ka ohun ti o ro nipa ara rẹ akoko.
The car did not move.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa ko gbe.
It does not matter.	Ko ṣe pataki.
The brother who wrote that letter was not alone.	Arakunrin ti o kọ lẹta yẹn ko jẹ nikan.
How wonderful to be late.	Bawo ni iyanu lati pẹ.
Much has been said about it.	Pupọ ti sọ nipa rẹ.
That seems to be what everyone is interested in.	O dabi pe ohun ti gbogbo eniyan nifẹ si niyẹn.
We are planning a family trip.	A n gbero irin-ajo idile kan.
It weighs in the end.	O wọn ni ipari.
Just say.	O kan sọ.
Cannot be used for any purpose.	Ko ṣee lo fun eyikeyi idi.
We will not do anything.	A ko ni ṣe ohunkohun.
I have come.	Mo ti wa.
I love vacation time from work.	Mo nifẹ akoko isinmi lati iṣẹ.
The system does not seem to be one.	Eto dabi pe ko jẹ ọkan.
I know everything.	Mo mọ ohun gbogbo.
You are the father of all men.	Iwọ ni baba gbogbo eniyan.
I don’t know how they can do that.	Emi ko mọ bi wọn yoo ṣe le ṣe iyẹn.
And with that, there is another.	Ati pẹlu, pe o wa miiran.
But live today.	Sugbon gbe loni.
Everything is evil.	Ohun gbogbo ni ibi.
They did even in the back.	Wọn ti ṣe paapaa ni ẹhin.
But it’s time to say enough.	Ṣugbọn o to akoko lati sọ pe o to.
Only your words are important.	Ọrọ rẹ nikan ni o ṣe pataki.
It has yet to catch up.	O ni sibẹsibẹ lati yẹ soke.
Now they do everything together.	Bayi wọn ṣe ohun gbogbo papọ.
Outside the house there are large gardens.	Ni ita ile naa ni awọn ọgba nla wa.
He seems to be back in time.	O dabi pe o pada wa ni akoko.
That is not surprising.	Iyẹn kii ṣe iyalẹnu.
It was the first day of summer.	O jẹ ọjọ akọkọ ti ooru.
Okay, not always.	O dara, kii ṣe nigbagbogbo.
I love it even when they do it several times.	Mo nifẹ paapaa nigbati wọn ba ṣe ni igba pupọ.
Not as we did.	Ko bi a ti ṣe.
A house has been built.	A ti kọ ile kan silẹ.
No, just serious.	Rara, o kan pataki.
Two of them were surprising to me too.	Meji ninu wọn jẹ iyalẹnu fun mi paapaa.
Other name fields have multiple settings.	Awọn aaye orukọ miiran ni awọn eto pupọ.
Perform two tasks.	Ṣiṣẹ awọn iṣẹ meji.
The music was the same.	Awọn orin je kanna.
But we know who knows.	Ṣugbọn a mọ ẹniti o mọ.
Nothing else could have been done.	Ko si ohun miiran ti o le ti ṣe.
I need to hurry.	Mo nilo lati yara yara.
We'll see you later.	A yoo ri e nigba miiran.
He painted a picture of his father.	O ya aworan baba rẹ.
It was his last sight, too.	O je rẹ kẹhin oju, ju.
He gave me everything.	O fun mi ni ohun gbogbo.
You need men.	O nilo awọn ọkunrin.
You deserve an error message.	O yẹ fun aṣiṣe aṣiṣe.
I am giving you permission to do that.	Mo n fun ọ ni aye lati ṣe iyẹn.
But he lost home.	Ṣugbọn o padanu ile.
Such applications perform well in these situations.	Iru awọn ohun elo ṣe daradara ni awọn ipo wọnyi.
You will only find it everywhere.	O yoo ri i nikan nibi gbogbo.
I think more people should be like that, honestly.	Mo ro pe eniyan diẹ sii yẹ ki o jẹ iru bẹ, ni otitọ.
It seems incomprehensible.	O dabi nkan ti ko ni oye.
The book can be found here.	Iwe le ṣee ri nibi.
It’s just too hard to let go of our identity.	O kan nira pupọ lati jẹ ki a ko mọ ararẹ.
This is where you live.	Eyi ni ibi ti o ngbe.
It has already been done and can be repeated.	O ti ṣe tẹlẹ ati pe o tun le tun ṣe.
Of course, this is not the only way.	Dajudaju, eyi kii ṣe ọna nikan.
They got through, man.	Wọn ti gba nipasẹ, ọkunrin.
People have been very interested in this area for a long time.	Awọn eniyan ti nifẹ pupọ si agbegbe yii fun igba pipẹ.
Write pictures here.	Ko awon aworan ni ibi.
He ran across the field.	O si sare kọja awọn aaye.
I have no idea whether he would like to.	Emi ko ni imọran boya yoo fẹ.
No books at home.	Ko si iwe to ni ile.
You do not have to get anything.	O ko ni lati gba ohunkohun.
As soon as we reached the top.	Ni kete ti a de oke.
And he just decided not to tell me.	Ati pe o kan pinnu lati ma sọ ​​fun mi.
Women washing clothes in the river.	Awọn obinrin ti n fọ aṣọ ni odo.
You will deal with these.	Iwọ yoo ṣe pẹlu awọn wọnyi.
This is a great one.	Eyi jẹ nla kan.
You have to wonder what your question is.	O ni lati ṣe iyalẹnu kini ibeere rẹ.
Maybe someone has died.	Boya ẹnikan ti ku.
You only get one.	O gba ọkan nikan.
And how do they do it?	Ati bawo ni wọn ṣe?
This method is good,	Ọna ẹkọ yii dara,
But it looks like one.	Ṣugbọn o dabi ọkan.
Okay, listen.	O dara, gbọ.
No words and no pictures appeared in my head.	Ko si ọrọ ati ko si awọn aworan ti o han ni ori mi.
Next week, that will be the most important game.	Ni ọsẹ lẹhin, iyẹn yoo jẹ ere pataki julọ.
At least do that.	O kere ṣe iyẹn.
The world is my picture.	Aye ni aworan mi.
We were afraid to go out at night.	A bẹru lati jade ni alẹ.
She wants you to tell it all to her.	O fẹ ki o sọ gbogbo rẹ fun u.
He learned that he had something.	O kọ pe o ni nkankan.
I enjoy myself beyond information.	Mo gbadun ara mi kọja alaye.
You need to pay your bills.	O nilo lati san owo rẹ.
However, other things are in play here.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ohun miiran wa ni ere nibi.
Of course they are not.	Dajudaju wọn kii ṣe.
The party won the contract.	Ẹgbẹ naa gba adehun naa.
I am no better than anyone else.	Emi ko dara ju ẹnikẹni miiran lọ.
And your own.	Ati ti ara rẹ.
This cannot be allowed.	Eyi ko le gba laaye.
It could be me at this point.	O le jẹ mi ni akoko yii.
I'll see.	Emi yoo rii.
And it won’t be.	Ati pe kii yoo jẹ.
The boy was amazed.	Iyalẹnu ni ọmọkunrin naa.
Tips on how to use it change in hours.	Awọn imọran lori bi o ṣe le lo o yipada ni wakati.
And her husband.	Ati ọkọ rẹ.
Just full of people.	O kan kun fun eniyan.
I, too, have thought of this before.	Emi naa, ti ronu eyi tẹlẹ.
I think about it now, that amazing point.	Mo tun ronu nipa rẹ ni bayi, aaye iyalẹnu yẹn.
They can’t get through a dinner party.	Wọn ko le gba nipasẹ ounjẹ alẹ kan.
That has become a problem under small schools.	Iyẹn ti di iṣoro labẹ awọn ile-iwe kekere.
It is not your circumstances that make you happy.	Kii ṣe awọn ipo rẹ lo jẹ ki inu rẹ dun.
But maybe you will.	Ṣugbọn boya iwọ yoo.
This will not work the other way around.	Eyi kii yoo ṣiṣẹ ni ọna miiran ni ayika.
The doctor needs to tell.	Dokita nilo lati sọ fun.
What you see may surprise you.	Ohun ti o rii le ṣe iyalẹnu.
Okay, not this guy.	O dara, kii ṣe ọmọkunrin yii.
Family history reveals three dead brothers.	Itan idile fi han awọn arakunrin mẹta ti o ku.
If he does, he will work.	Ti o ba ṣe, oun yoo ṣiṣẹ.
Not a big deal, to me.	Kii ṣe nkan nla, si mi.
It looks like my story.	O dabi iru itan mi gaan.
You may or may not know me.	O le tabi ko le mọ mi.
Very good, he said.	O dara gaan, o sọ.
They do not know where they live.	Wọn ko mọ ibi ti wọn ngbe.
A few bad months, a few good ones.	Awọn oṣu buburu diẹ, awọn ti o dara diẹ.
It has been a long time ago.	O ti jẹ igba pipẹ sẹhin.
No one and nothing gets in your way.	Ko si ẹnikan ati ohunkohun ti o gba ni ọna rẹ.
Just because it is outdoors.	O kan nitori pe o wa ni ita gbangba.
We need more of that going around.	A nilo diẹ sii ti eyi ti n lọ ni ayika.
It is a wonderful book.	Iwe iyanu ni gaan.
He did this.	O ṣe eyi.
He raised his eyes to look at her.	O si gbe oju rẹ soke lati wo i.
You tried it again.	O tun gbiyanju o.
I deserve to call you.	Mo yẹ lati pe e.
To some extent, of course.	Si aaye kan, dajudaju.
I think you see it first.	Mo ro pe o ri akọkọ.
We have not talked about this in many years.	A ko ti sọrọ nipa eyi ni ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
Some are great, some not so.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni o wa nla, diẹ ninu awọn ko bẹ.
The site is at the bottom of a hill.	Aaye naa wa ni isalẹ ti oke kan.
In your work.	Ni iṣẹ rẹ.
He saw something.	O ri nkankan.
Either way, they are gone now.	Ọna boya, wọn ti lọ ni bayi.
My first job was on site with a lot of books.	Iṣẹ akọkọ mi wa ni aaye pẹlu ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe.
Look back at them, but do not say anything.	Wo wọn pada, ṣugbọn maṣe sọ nkan kan.
But this by the way.	Ṣugbọn eyi nipasẹ ọna.
The truth is not how you want it to be.	Otitọ kii ṣe bi o ṣe fẹ ki o jẹ.
They live in a house.	Won n gbe ile.
However, we ask the following questions.	Sibẹsibẹ, a beere awọn wọnyi ibeere.
I did not hear it coming, and.	Emi ko gbọ ti o bọ, ati.
This may not be true.	Eyi ko le jẹ otitọ.
I am not good at this kind of thing.	Emi ko dara ni iru nkan yii.
I also think teachers should hold that power.	Mo tun ro pe awọn olukọ yẹ ki o di agbara yẹn mu.
This is my life.	Eyi ni aye mi.
You read and interpret things the way you want.	O ka ati tumọ awọn nkan ni ọna ti o fẹ.
The future could be a better future.	Ojo iwaju le jẹ ojo iwaju ti o dara.
It would be better if we took it to the doctor.	Yoo dara ti a ba gbe e lọ si ọdọ dokita.
They are not of any kind.	Wọn kii ṣe ohunkohun ti iru.
No one there ever forgot it.	Ko si ẹniti o wa nibẹ lailai gbagbe rẹ.
We only do it inside.	A ṣe inu nikan.
I refuse exams or lessons.	Mo kọ idanwo tabi ẹkọ.
I think I am alone.	Mo ro pe emi nikan ni.
They have to get out.	Wọn ni lati jade.
He stopped at the end.	O duro ni ipari.
The child needs to learn to speak.	Ọmọ naa nilo lati kọ ẹkọ lati sọrọ.
And he was always afraid.	Ati pe o bẹru nigbagbogbo.
Sometimes the problem goes elsewhere.	Nigba miiran iṣoro naa ti lọ si aaye miiran.
His intelligence is great.	Ọgbọn rẹ jẹ nla.
The world cannot be a cause in itself.	Aye ko le jẹ idi kan funrararẹ.
I love the idea.	Mo nifẹ imọran naa.
I can talk.	Mo le sọrọ.
They did not.	Wọn ko ṣe bẹ.
Make no mistake or anything.	Ko ṣe aṣiṣe tabi ohunkohun.
I told her she was beautiful.	Mo sọ fun u pe o lẹwa.
Most of my money goes to food.	Pupọ julọ owo mi lọ si ounjẹ.
I always drink tea.	Mo nigbagbogbo mu tii.
Can't say why you think so.	Ko le sọ idi ti o fi ro bẹ.
You had a bad day.	O ni ọjọ buburu kan.
He stood behind her.	O duro lẹhin rẹ.
You just need a good teacher.	O kan nilo olukọ to dara.

Time and energy are wasted.	Akoko ati agbara lo daradara.

Often that is because we do not try to understand them.	Nigbagbogbo iyẹn jẹ nitori a ko gbiyanju lati loye wọn.

This is why we plan on ourselves.	Eyi ni idi ti a gbero lori ara wa.

All my friends are dead.	Gbogbo awọn ọrẹ mi ti ku.

And he will always be.	Ati pe oun yoo wa nigbagbogbo.

He did not know if he would try to help her.	Ko mọ boya oun yoo gbiyanju lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.

You can't ignore it.	O ko le ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
I know what to do.	Mo mọ ohun ti yoo ṣe.
He has done so much for this city.	O ti ṣe pupọ pupọ fun ilu yii.
But it was civil law at the time.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ofin ilu ni akoko yẹn.
I think there is a better way to work with people.	Mo ro pe ọna ti o dara julọ wa lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu eniyan.
Do not bathe in the river.	Maṣe wẹ ninu odo.
Mistakes made.	Awọn aṣiṣe ṣe.

They dragged them into the garden.	Wọn fa wọn sinu ọgba.
All areas of the house have a water supply.	Gbogbo awọn agbegbe ti ile naa ni omi kan.

Dad never talked about that life at all.	Baba ko sọrọ nipa aye yẹn rara.
I learned hard.	Mo kọ ẹkọ lile.
They do not have time to finish their work.	Awọn ko ni akoko lati pari iṣẹ wọn.
The world does not rotate around the body.	Aye ko ni yi ni ayika ara.
He turned and started walking towards the living room.	O yipada o bẹrẹ si lọ si ọna yara yara.
You may have been here.	O le ti wa nibi.
She is my best friend.	O jẹ ọrẹ mi to dara julọ.
It starts to fill.	O bẹrẹ lati kun.
He changed every other.	O si yi pada gbogbo miiran.
You will give the whole thing to me.	Iwọ yoo fi gbogbo nkan naa si mi.
It should start at the same level as your parents.	O gbọdọ bẹrẹ ni ipo kanna ti awọn obi rẹ.
There is no way to know how long it has been down.	Ko ni ọna lati mọ bi o ṣe pẹ to ti o ti wa ni isalẹ.
I will never see my son.	Emi ko ni ri ọmọ mi.
They are for me.	Won wa fun mi.
That’s the whole thing.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo nkan naa.
He will reveal it to anyone.	Oun yoo fi han ẹnikẹni.
This saved me a lot of money.	Eleyi fi mi kan pupo ti owo.
It doesn’t take much time to pass.	Ko gba akoko pupọ lati kọja.
Here, give me your hand.	Bọ mi lọwọ, nibi.
But it is, it has to be.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ, o ni lati jẹ.
I just want to pass.	Mo kan fẹ lati kọja.
He seemed to decide for a minute.	O dabi enipe o pinnu fun iṣẹju kan.
Some things have changed here.	Diẹ ninu awọn nkan ti yipada nibi.
The last thing this means is a big deal for me.	Ohun ti o kẹhin yii tumọ si adehun nla fun mi.
I was so scared for the whole thing.	Mo bẹru pupọ fun gbogbo nkan naa.
He turned his head.	O si yi ori rẹ pada.
He wants what he wants.	O fe ohun ti o fe.
I also removed his food and put it back.	Mo tun ti yọ ounjẹ rẹ kuro ki o si fi i pada.
None of this is correct.	Ko si eyi ti o tọ.
Just tell me to stop.	Kan so fun mi lati da.
He called our attention.	O pe akiyesi wa si.
We will collect your information and build a site for you.	A yoo gba alaye rẹ ki o kọ aaye kan fun ọ.
I do not know this at all.	Emi ko mọ eyi rara.
It is changing so much in life.	O ti n yipada pupọ ni igbesi aye.
Others will return to their homes.	Awọn miiran yoo pada si ile aye wọn.
I am on your boat.	Mo wa lori ọkọ oju omi rẹ.
It works fine.	O ṣiṣẹ dara.
But that should happen soon.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ laipẹ.
It just seems, there you go.	O kan dabi, nibẹ ni o lọ.
If they don't want my money, they won't.	Ti won ko ba fe owo mi, won o ni.
Nor are we intended to harm you.	Tabi a ko pinnu lati ṣe ipalara fun ọ.
It almost sounds like it.	O fẹrẹ dabi ohun rẹ.
It should be something to keep to one.	O yẹ ki o jẹ nkan lati tọju si ọkan.
I woke up.	Mo ti ji.
He found there was no other place to eat.	O rii pe ko si aaye miiran lati jẹun.
I don’t know if that’s even possible.	Emi ko mọ boya iyẹn paapaa ṣee ṣe.
You did what we told you to do.	O ṣe ohun ti a sọ fun ọ.
They all need that.	Gbogbo wọn nilo iyẹn.
If you bring in a higher resolution.	Ti o ba mu ni ipinnu ti o ga julọ.
He locked the door with a key.	O si ti ilẹkun pẹlu bọtini kan.
Now, he knew he would have to.	Bayi, o mọ pe oun yoo ni lati.
It's sweet.	O dun.
I know about your parents.	Mo mọ nipa awọn obi rẹ.
This can be done for several reasons.	Eyi le ṣee ṣe fun awọn idi pupọ.
This seems to help a little.	Eyi dabi pe o ṣe iranlọwọ diẹ.
He is angry with me.	O binu si mi.
We both had that big truck.	A ni awọn mejeeji ni ọkọ nla yẹn.
They left.	Wọn lọ kuro.
It has been a while ago.	O ti jẹ igba diẹ sẹhin.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ko ṣe aṣiṣe rara.
She has an eye for such a thing.	O ni oju fun iru nkan bẹẹ.
They sell very little.	Wọn ta silẹ pupọ diẹ.
He'll see that soon enough.	Oun yoo rii iyẹn laipẹ to.
You do not want to let go.	O ko fẹ lati jẹ ki lọ.
So, why pay for one of these devices ?.	Nitorina, kilode ti o san owo fun ọkan ninu awọn ẹrọ wọnyi ?.
He hurried out of the room.	O yara kuro ni yara naa.
This is not a bad thing or a mistake.	Eyi kii ṣe nkan buburu tabi aṣiṣe.
You will know when it is over.	Iwọ yoo mọ nigbati o ba pari.
It is important to understand this.	O ṣe pataki lati ni oye eyi.
We see everything.	A ri ohun gbogbo.
And the problem is the people in the office.	Ati pe iṣoro naa ni awọn eniyan ti o wa ni ọfiisi.
It is very powerful.	O ni agbara pupọ.
However, people changed.	Sibẹsibẹ, eniyan yipada.
My dad just loves to talk.	Baba mi kan fẹran lati sọrọ.
This is explained here.	A ṣe alaye eyi nibi.
Or it may not happen at all.	Tabi o le ma ṣẹlẹ rara.
We do not see where it came from.	A ko rii ibi ti o ti wa.
My personal love and the love of my family.	Ifẹ ti ara mi ati ifẹ ti idile mi.
He opened the door of his office.	O ṣi ilẹkun ọfiisi rẹ.
I would have thought it would hurt more.	Emi yoo ti ro pe yoo ṣe ipalara diẹ sii.
There is a woman from school.	Obinrin kan wa lati ile-iwe.
A little time is always a little time to get a reason.	Akoko kekere nigbagbogbo jẹ akoko kekere lati gba idi kan.
This will continue for months.	Eyi yoo tẹsiwaju fun awọn oṣu.
You just want people to see.	O kan fẹ ki awọn eniyan rii.
I also get a bad space here and there.	Mo tun gba aaye ti ko dara nibi ati nibẹ.
He does not like my family.	Ko fẹran idile mi.
I don't know where I went now.	Emi ko mọ ibiti mo ti lọ ni bayi.
And that is true for most people.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ otitọ fun ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
That doesn’t mean the dog knows me.	Iyẹn ko tumọ si pe aja mọ mi.
It seems that other services are not working properly.	O dabi pe awọn iṣẹ miiran ko ṣiṣẹ daradara.
There is nothing to eat for many, many days.	Ko si nkankan lati jẹ fun ọpọlọpọ, ọpọlọpọ awọn ọjọ.
I have to give it to him.	Mo ni lati fun u.
That is why the first only works.	Ti o ni idi ti akọkọ nikan ṣiṣẹ.
I agree, too.	Mo gba, paapaa.
These people can do whatever they want.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi le ṣe ohunkohun ti wọn fẹ.
Other things.	Awọn nkan miiran.
This is causing them great harm.	Eyi n ṣe wọn ni ipalara nla.
She saw him, she missed him, she saw him again.	O ri i, o padanu rẹ, o tun ri i lẹẹkansi.
He tried to find.	O gbiyanju lati ri.
But there is a lot of historical power to me there.	Ṣugbọn agbara itan pupọ wa si mi nibẹ.
Lots of people.	Pupọ eniyan.
He stopped and looked at her.	O duro ati ki o wo pẹlu rẹ.
Mo sare sare.	Mo sare sare.
The work is finished.	Iṣẹ naa ti pari.
You have done well.	O ti ṣe daradara.
I can't go home.	Nko le pada si ile.
That way they will try to understand the problems.	Iyẹn ọna wọn yoo gbiyanju lati ni oye awọn iṣoro naa.
I didn’t touch it, of course.	Emi ko fi ọwọ kan rẹ, dajudaju.
I have some of your books.	Mo ni diẹ ninu awọn iwe rẹ.
But their performance improved.	Ṣugbọn iṣẹ wọn dara si.
You know my wife.	O mọ iyawo mi.
Everything is over for him.	Ohun gbogbo ti pari fun u.
There is little you can do about it.	Diẹ diẹ ni o le ṣe nipa eyi.
No one spoke.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọrọ.
But that changed last year.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn yipada ni ọdun to kọja.
I hope you will have a good time.	Mo nireti pe iwọ yoo ni akoko ti o dara.
I made a garden for me.	Mo ṣe ọgba fun mi.
I can leave.	Mo le lọ kuro.
And they are not children, any of these people.	Ati pe wọn kii ṣe ọmọde, eyikeyi ninu awọn eniyan wọnyi.
I can wait and see how it goes.	Mo le duro ati wo bi o ṣe n lọ.
You can see it in the picture below.	O le rii ninu aworan ni isalẹ.
Because this is what they are in my eyes.	Nitori eyi ni ohun ti wọn wa ni oju mi.
In a minute you will make your clothes.	Ni iṣẹju kan iwọ yoo ṣe aṣọ rẹ.
But it does not happen.	Sugbon o ko ni ṣẹlẹ.
I was sick.	Ara mi ko ya.
The method works today.	Ọna naa n ṣiṣẹ loni.
Devices of speech.	Awọn ẹrọ ti ọrọ.
These people do not exist at all.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi ko wa patapata.
Do you hope to die today?	Ṣe o nireti lati ku loni?
It will be fine.	Yoo dara.
I really enjoyed the work.	Mo gbadun iṣẹ naa gaan.
She looked down, scared.	O wo isalẹ, o bẹru.
He stopped as soon as he entered the room.	O duro ni kete ti o wọ inu yara naa.
Meet this little boy.	Pade yi kekere ọmọkunrin.
Okay, you.	O dara, iwọ.
He is in love.	O wa ninu ifẹ.
I think my team spent more with them, giving us an edge.	Mo ro pe ẹgbẹ mi lo diẹ sii pẹlu wọn, fun wa ni eti.
But today you can and must wait.	Ṣugbọn loni o le ati pe o gbọdọ duro.
They are important to your plans.	Wọn ṣe pataki si awọn eto rẹ.
His wife is dead.	Iyawo re lo ti ku.
Your life depends on it.	Igbesi aye rẹ da lori rẹ.
Dogs are dogs, so they say.	Aja jẹ aja, nitorina wọn sọ.
Okay, I'm glad to hear.	O dara, inu mi dun lati gbọ.
It makes my life feel special.	O jẹ ki igbesi aye mi lero pataki.

A little money goes a long way.	Owo kekere kan lọ ni ọna pipẹ.

With two dogs.	Pẹlu awọn aja meji.
This will have to change.	Eyi yoo ni lati yipada.

Police arrested two men last week.	Awọn ọlọpa mu awọn ọkunrin meji ni ọsẹ to kọja.
But this is happening.	Ṣugbọn eyi n ṣẹlẹ.
I work in two local communities.	Mo ṣiṣẹ ni awọn agbegbe agbegbe meji.
You want to be a teacher one day.	O fẹ lati jẹ olukọ ni ọjọ kan.

At first about about.	Ni igba akọkọ ti nipa nipa.
Maybe husband and wife.	Boya ọkọ ati iyawo.
I've had enough trouble.	Mo ti sọ wahala to.
That is what we should talk about.	Iyẹn ni o yẹ ki a sọrọ nipa.
Your body knows it, too.	Ara rẹ mọ o, ju.
And you have to learn something like that forever.	Ati pe o ni lailai lati kọ ẹkọ bii.
They go out and happen to things.	Wọn jade lọ ati ṣẹlẹ si awọn nkan.
I know how you feel, boy.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe rilara, ọmọkunrin.
We will hit any price.	A yoo lu eyikeyi owo.
He is in good hands.	O wa ni ọwọ ti o dara.
Maybe that was to get me out of the room.	Boya iyẹn ni lati mu mi jade kuro ninu yara naa.
He just wants us to be seen and have the best.	Oun nikan fẹ ki a rii ati ni ohun ti o dara julọ.
He came back.	O pada wa.
Great week for the company.	Ọsẹ nla fun ile-iṣẹ naa.
We will drink hot tea.	A o mu tii gbona.
Importance of fields.	Pataki ti awọn aaye.
Two, because it felt really good.	Meji, nitori ti o ro gan ti o dara.
Or maybe he knew he would understand and wanted to hurt her.	Tabi boya o mọ pe oun yoo loye ati pe o fẹ lati ṣe ipalara fun u.
He took her warm hand.	O mu ọwọ gbona rẹ.
Nothing will stand in your way.	Ko si ohun ti yoo duro ni ọna rẹ.
I still have my period.	Mo tun ni nkan oṣu mi.
We write letters.	A kọ awọn lẹta.
But it does not need to be.	Ṣugbọn ko nilo lati jẹ.
It makes everyone around you feel better.	O mu ki gbogbo eniyan ni ayika rẹ dara julọ.
No, we cannot do that.	Rara, a ko le ṣe iyẹn.
They are very small, and very small.	Wọn kere pupọ, ati pe o kere pupọ.
Marry only when you find the right person.	Ṣe igbeyawo nikan nigbati o ba ri eniyan ti o tọ.
That was very difficult for me.	Iyẹn nira pupọ fun mi.
Both are young only.	Awọn mejeeji jẹ ọmọde nikan.
No help for it, however.	Ko si iranlọwọ fun o, sibẹsibẹ.
You want to do.	O fẹ ṣe.
Now you know it’s the other way around.	Bayi o mọ pe o jẹ ọna miiran ni ayika.
It sounds good.	O dun dara.
But, you know, that's fine.	Ṣugbọn, o mọ, iyẹn dara.
Whatever happens always has a reason, why it happened.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nigbagbogbo ni idi kan, idi ti o fi ṣẹlẹ.
It just doesn’t seem to be the right food to open up for.	O kan ko dabi pe o wa ounjẹ to tọ lati ṣii fun.
Leave it to me.	Fi silẹ fun mi.
Pick it up as you wish.	Gbe soke ni bi o ṣe fẹ.

That, however, is not your way.	Iyẹn, sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe ọna tirẹ.
A trip, maybe, but that’s another story.	Irin-ajo kan, boya, ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ itan miiran.
You know this is a mistake.	O mọ pe eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.

I’m glad you can do it on my holiday.	Inu mi dun pe o le ṣe ni ọjọ isinmi mi.
How you complete your work is important.	Bi o ṣe pari iṣẹ rẹ ni o ṣe pataki.
A year ago my father died.	Ni ọdun kan sẹhin baba mi ti ku.
Just a happy person.	O kan dun eniyan.
He looked at the side.	O wo ẹgbẹ naa.
That brother is no longer my friend.	Arakunrin yẹn kii ṣe ọrẹ mi mọ.
It never changed.	Ko yipada rara.
I can not get up.	Nko le dide.
This is the situation.	Eyi ni ipo naa.

Pretend not to.	Ṣe bi ẹni pe ko si.
No one wants to talk to me anymore.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹ sọrọ si mi mọ.
I want to see what the girl knows.	Mo fẹ lati wo ohun ti ọmọbirin naa mọ.
Remember this point well.	Ranti aaye yii daradara.
The problem is that most of these homes do not accept.	Iṣoro naa ni pe pupọ julọ awọn ile wọnyi ko gba.
It takes a lot of love, attention and walking.	O gba ọpọlọpọ ifẹ, akiyesi ati rin.
My life on it, his father was never angry with his brother.	Igbesi aye mi lori rẹ, baba rẹ ko binu si arakunrin rẹ rara.
You usually see two people at a time.	O maa n ri eniyan meji ni akoko kan.

I just found the truth.	Mo kan wa otitọ.
We talked about her life as a mother.	A sọrọ nipa igbesi aye rẹ bi iya.
You want to treat it that way.	O fẹ lati tọju rẹ ni ọna yẹn.
It will not be possible.	Kii yoo ṣee ṣe.

Sleep out today.	Sun jade loni.

Would love to.	Yoo nifẹ lati.
And just wait for me, baby.	Ati ki o kan duro fun mi, ọmọ.

Remove from heat, enjoy.	Yọ kuro ninu ooru, gbadun.
The decisions are final.	Awọn ipinnu jẹ ipari.

He never said no.	Ko sọ rara.
I have been drinking tea.	Mo ti pa tii mu.
I have heard about stories.	Mo ti gbọ nipa awọn itan.
The only problem area is attention.	Agbegbe iṣoro nikan ni akiyesi.
And nothing you say is personal.	Ati pe ko si ohun ti o sọ jẹ ti ara ẹni.
They are one.	Wọn jẹ ọkan.
I have two of them.	Mo ni meji ninu wọn.
He can no longer give them.	Ko le fun wọn mọ.
The letter must be genuine and to the point.	Lẹta naa gbọdọ jẹ otitọ ati si aaye.
As fast as possible now.	Bi sare bi o ti ṣee ṣe ni bayi.
It was a good game by him.	O jẹ ere ti o dara nipasẹ rẹ.
You did well.	O ṣe daradara.
But it is hard to see.	Sugbon o jẹ gidigidi lati ri.
My whole family.	Gbogbo idile mi.
Go ahead, feeling it.	Tẹsiwaju, rilara rẹ.
You have a place to live.	O ni ibi kan lati gbe.
But something seems off about them.	Ṣugbọn nkankan dabi pa nipa wọn.
He is happy.	Inu re dun.
I like the song.	Mo fẹran orin naa.
We walk the talk.	A rin ọrọ naa.
Easy to use.	Rọrun lati lo.
Now it stops.	Bayi o duro.
When it rains, you can hardly hear.	Nigbati ojo ba n ro, o le lati gbọ.
It just seems to be like that.	O dabi pe o kan yẹ lati dabi iyẹn.
If you have some new, great.	Ti o ba ni diẹ ninu awọn tuntun, nla.
I wonder about the others.	Mo ṣe iyalẹnu nipa awọn miiran.
I will be in my office.	Emi yoo wa ni ọfiisi mi.
We won’t know, and it doesn’t matter.	A kii yoo mọ, ati pe ko ṣe pataki.
Take my money.	Gba owo mi.
But we will find a way.	Ṣugbọn a yoo wa ọna kan.
Maybe it’s as simple as that.	Boya o rọrun bi iyẹn.
A really long day it seems, too.	A gan gun ọjọ ti o dabi, ju.
We hope you are right.	A nireti pe o tọ.
It is not our job.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ wa.
That alone is an idea of ​​how it can happen.	Iyẹn nikan ni imọran ti bii o ṣe le ṣẹlẹ.
People here live a very difficult life.	Awọn eniyan nibi n gbe igbesi aye ti o nira pupọ.
Therefore, we do not consider it here.	Nitorina, a ko ro o nibi.
Not just in some of us.	Kii ṣe ninu diẹ ninu wa nikan.
At first, they hadn’t done anything yet.	Ni akọkọ, wọn ko tii ṣe ohunkohun sibẹsibẹ.
Just thinking about it the other day.	O kan n ronu nipa rẹ ni ọjọ miiran.
I know they have a lot to learn.	Mo mọ pe wọn ni ọpọlọpọ lati kọ ẹkọ.
Now more than ever.	Bayi diẹ sii ju lailai.
A minute has passed.	Iṣẹju kan ti kọja.
Not because he is a great person.	Kii ṣe nitori pe o jẹ eniyan nla.
Must be early in the morning.	Gbọdọ jẹ owurọ owurọ.
There is no agreement on that.	Ko si adehun lori iyẹn.
I can't remember any other details.	Emi ko le ranti eyikeyi awọn alaye miiran.
Your mother will give birth at any time.	Iya rẹ yoo bi ọmọ ni eyikeyi akoko.
He no longer believes.	Ko gbagbọ mọ.
Time to turn off the lights and go to bed!	Akoko lati pa awọn ina ki o lọ si ibusun!
Both will do a great job.	Awọn mejeeji yoo ṣe iṣẹ nla kan.
That should be correct.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o tọ.
For a few minutes.	Fun iṣẹju diẹ.
Whatever it is you do.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ o ṣe.
Of course, we can not.	Dajudaju, a ko le.
I have never been home.	Emi ko tii wa ni ile rara.
This is the main building.	Eleyi jẹ akọkọ ile.
I refuse to do.	Mo kọ lati ṣe.
He’s a good boy, but he loves to talk, especially.	O jẹ ọmọkunrin ti o dara, ṣugbọn o nifẹ lati sọrọ, paapaa.
My wife is dead.	Iyawo mi ti ku.
These are the two restaurants that make your favorite food.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn ile ounjẹ meji ti o ṣe ounjẹ ayanfẹ rẹ.
Sorry, we have not used the time.	Ma binu, a ko ti lo akoko.
I do not know how to handle such a thing.	Emi ko mọ bi a ṣe le mu iru nkan bẹẹ.
It doesn’t seem like you’ve already made a lot of friends, actually.	Ko dabi ẹni pe o ti ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ, ni otitọ.
You should be able to hear.	O yẹ ki o ni anfani lati gbọ.
That life is over for him.	Igbesi aye yẹn ti pari fun u.
Best of all, good friends.	Ti o dara ju, awọn ọrẹ to dara.
Our marriage is over.	Igbeyawo wa ti pari.
After a minute, they continued.	Lẹhin iṣẹju kan, wọn tẹsiwaju.
Sometimes when you don’t think you can, you do.	Awọn igba miiran nigbati o ko ro pe o le, o ṣe.
We give them whatever they want.	A fun wọn ni ohunkohun ti wọn ba fẹ.
Finally, an agreement has been reached.	Ni ipari, adehun ti de.
It is a space without time.	O jẹ aaye laisi akoko.
They see how it arrives.	Wọn wo bi o ti de.
I tell you what we will do.	Mo sọ fun ọ ohun ti a yoo ṣe.
The more games we play mean more information.	Awọn ere diẹ sii ti a ṣe tumọ si alaye diẹ sii.
Both beautiful.	Awọn mejeeji lẹwa.
No one on this earth can live without it.	Ko si enikeni lori ile aye yi ti o le gbe laisi rẹ.
It sounds bad.	O dun buburu.
Kill me, and get the money.	Pa mi, ki o si gba owo naa.
It looks great.	O n wo pupọ.
But it doesn’t work for everyone.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣiṣẹ fun gbogbo eniyan.
They will give in if you do this, very well will.	Wọn yoo fun ni ti o ba ṣe eyi, daradara julọ yoo.
They are in love and making ideas.	Wọn wa ninu ifẹ ati ṣiṣe awọn ero.
You pay school fees.	O san owo ile-iwe.
The money is not over.	Owo naa ko kọja.
We want relaxation.	A fẹ isinmi.
Even longer than the first.	Paapaa o gun ju ti akọkọ lọ.
We have the space to build a great company.	A ni aye lati kọ ile-iṣẹ nla kan.
I think this could be them.	Mo ro pe eyi le jẹ wọn.
You will spend most of your time with the people there.	Iwọ yoo lo pupọ julọ akoko rẹ pẹlu awọn eniyan nibẹ.
He did not, however, place his hand on my mother.	Ko, sibẹsibẹ, gbe ọwọ le iya mi.
I made this house for you.	Mo ṣe ile yii fun ọ.
It seems forever.	O dabi lailai.
I said this in my speech to the police.	Mo sọ eyi ninu ọrọ mi si ọlọpa.
A boy and a girl.	Ọmọkunrin kan ati ọmọbirin kan.
He did not know what his feet were doing.	Ko mọ ohun ti awọn ẹsẹ rẹ n ṣe.
So let it pass.	Nitorina jẹ ki o kọja.
It is more difficult, but not impossible.	O nira sii, ṣugbọn kii ṣe ṣeeṣe.
However, he was not happy.	Sibẹsibẹ, inu rẹ ko dun.
I found a seat.	Mo ri ijoko.
To take care of myself only.	Lati tọju ara mi nikan.
Their feet have nothing to do with it.	Ẹsẹ wọn ko ni nkan ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
Too much to read.	Pupọ pupọ lati ka.
A friend had to tell me it wasn’t my story.	Ọrẹ kan ni lati sọ fun mi pe kii ṣe itan mi.
And the game was what it was.	Ati awọn ere wà ohun ti o wà.
I have to go out.	Mo ni lati jade.
And we went.	Ati pe a lọ.
We will have to change that.	A yoo ni lati yi iyẹn pada.
Without them, no work would be possible.	Laisi wọn, ko si iṣẹ ti yoo ṣee ṣe.
I understand where it is coming from.	Mo loye ibiti o ti n bọ.
But no one said anything.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ohunkohun.
The celebrations continue for hours.	Awọn ayẹyẹ tẹsiwaju fun awọn wakati.
The game is the thing.	Ere naa jẹ nkan naa.
These words you?	Awọn ọrọ wọnyi iwọ?
He looked down at my hand.	O wo isalẹ ni ọwọ mi.
It worked well for them.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara fun wọn.
I love how it is.	Mo fẹran bi o ṣe wa.
At least we didn't have to deal with his father.	O kere ju a ko ni lati ba baba rẹ ṣe.
Their system did not work.	Eto wọn ko ṣiṣẹ.
However, that's all that ever happened.	Sibẹsibẹ, ti o ni gbogbo awọn ti o lailai ṣẹlẹ.

So be careful.	Nitorina ṣe akiyesi.
But it was a great listen.	Sugbon o je kan nla gbọ.
The woman's face was amazing to see.	Oju obinrin naa jẹ iyalẹnu lati ri.
She has been with him every afternoon for a week.	O ti wa pẹlu rẹ ni gbogbo ọsan fun ọsẹ kan.
In fact, no one knows where the issue started.	Ni otitọ, ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ ibiti ọrọ naa ti bẹrẹ.
Please ask me a question.	Jọwọ ṣe ibeere mi.
I am not a bad boy.	Emi kii ṣe ọmọkunrin buburu.
Nothing a family stays.	Ko si ohun to kan ebi duro.
I asked him if he was scared.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ boya o ti bẹru.
He waited his turn.	O duro de akoko rẹ.
But try to come up with more possible information.	Ṣugbọn gbiyanju lati wa pẹlu alaye ti o ṣeeṣe diẹ sii.
He obviously did not expect me.	O han gbangba pe ko nireti mi.
I went out and walked around for a while.	Mo jade lọ ki o si rin ni ayika fun igba diẹ.
His decision gave me a two-week break for work.	Ipinnu rẹ fun mi ni isinmi ọsẹ meji fun iṣẹ.
Or at least they try to.	Tabi o kere ju wọn gbiyanju lati.
They all refused.	Gbogbo wọn kọ.
It is love that can change people.	O jẹ ifẹ ti o le yi eniyan pada.
It is understandable.	O jẹ oye.
We are also with no idea when we will be out.	A tun wa pẹlu ko ni imọran igba ti a yoo jade.
It was mostly at night.	O jẹ julọ ni alẹ.
That is a very good idea.	Iyẹn jẹ imọran to dara gaan.
She wanted to hurt him.	O fẹ lati ṣe ipalara fun u.

He was indoors for an hour.	O wa ninu ile fun wakati kan.
There is another way to see.	Ọna miiran wa lati rii.
Not here, obviously.	Ko si nibi, o han ni.
We have taken too much.	A ti mu pupọ ju.

I look at the people around me.	Mo wo awọn eniyan ti o wa ni ayika mi.
She promised to help.	O ṣe ileri lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
You just have to ask.	O kan ni lati beere.
Everyone changed and moved up in life, he thought.	Gbogbo eniyan yipada ati gbe soke ni igbesi aye, o ro.
What made you decide to live in a small town?	Kini o jẹ ki o pinnu lati gbe ni ilu kekere kan?
Not feeling good.	Kii ṣe rilara ti o dara.
Or talk about it.	Tabi sọrọ nipa rẹ.
Take the field of ‘text’.	Gba aaye ti 'ọrọ'.
I need to do another.	Mo nilo lati ṣe miiran.
That is amazing.	Iyẹn jẹ iyalẹnu.
I can't get it.	Nko le gba a.
Many of these books are very helpful.	Pupọ ninu awọn iwe wọnyi jẹ iranlọwọ pupọ.
Everyone can enjoy them.	Gbogbo eniyan le gbadun wọn.
That has never happened.	Iyẹn ko tii ṣẹlẹ rara.
They will not give the whole picture.	Wọn kii yoo fun gbogbo aworan naa.
You will be sure to remember.	Iwọ yoo rii daju lati ranti.
The amount of food a person eats is the amount of food.	Ounjẹ ti eniyan jẹ ni iye ounjẹ.
The room was very clean and date.	Awọn yara wà gan o mọ ki o si ọjọ.
She had met my father, she had heard about my mother.	O ti pade baba mi, o ti gbọ nipa iya mi.
I told them, of course not.	Mo sọ fun wọn, dajudaju ko.
They did not, however, pass.	Wọn ko, sibẹsibẹ, kọja.
However, it has to be done.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ni lati ṣee.
You must come back.	O gbọdọ pada wa.
Which is not here or there.	Eyi ti ko si nibi tabi nibẹ.
Put us to the test.	Fi wa si idanwo.
That really changed things up a lot for me.	Ti o gan yi ohun soke a pupo fun mi.
For several hours he waited for his turn.	Fun awọn wakati pupọ o duro de akoko rẹ.
You will know better than me.	Iwọ yoo mọ dara ju mi ​​lọ.
Do not be hard on yourself.	Maṣe jẹ lile lori ara rẹ.
I told myself it wouldn’t matter.	Mo sọ fun ara mi pe kii yoo ṣe pataki.
Can anyone help me with this ?.	Le ẹnikẹni ran mi pẹlu yi ?.
You’re getting a little bad advice.	O n gba imọran buburu diẹ.
You can not do it at home.	O ko le ṣe ni ile.
But no one around to see me.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ni ayika lati ri mi.
At that time it was her husband.	Ni akoko yẹn o jẹ ọkọ rẹ.
She looked me up, her eyes wide.	O wo mi soke, oju rẹ ṣe pataki.
What kind of car are you looking for?	Iru ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wo ni o n wa?
But that sounds good.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn dun.
You are stuck with me now.	O ti di pẹlu mi bayi.
We also dedicate ourselves here to you.	A tun fi ara wa fun wa nibi fun ọ.
I love little kids.	Mo nifẹ awọn ọmọ kekere.
We just have to know how to find it.	A kan ni lati mọ bi a ṣe le rii.
I'm sure he is.	Mo da mi loju pe oun ni.
He has great power.	O ni agbara nla.
This is good.	Eyi dara.
Tell me you will try to be as you are.	Sọ fun mi pe iwọ yoo gbiyanju lati jẹ bi o ti jẹ tẹlẹ.
You can ask him about this.	O le beere lọwọ rẹ nipa eyi.
That is, the systems can work well.	Iyẹn ni, awọn ọna ṣiṣe le ṣiṣẹ daradara.
But they don't really want that.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko fẹ iyẹn gaan.
It's too late.	O ti n pẹ.
You can move.	O le gbe.
Obviously you need to do more.	O han gbangba o nilo lati ṣe diẹ sii.
The doctor said it was appropriate.	Dokita sọ pe o yẹ.
And we are looking for art.	Ati pe a wa aworan.
I don’t ask how long he has been there or what he wants.	Emi ko beere bi o gun o ti wa nibẹ tabi ohun ti o fe.
Come here.	Wa nibi.
The box was a gift for my brother.	Apoti naa jẹ ẹbun fun arakunrin mi.
If you need more help, please contact us.	Ti o ba nilo iranlọwọ diẹ sii, jọwọ kan si wa.
Well there was that as well.	Daradara nibẹ wà pe bi daradara.
Can you bring it here?	O le mu u nibi?
That sounds good.	O dun iyẹn.
Another easy way to start.	Ọna miiran ti o rọrun lati bẹrẹ.
Some of it.	Diẹ ninu rẹ.
We only know this very moment.	A nikan mọ yi gan akoko.
It is the same.	O jẹ kanna.
Or they are not alone.	Tabi wọn kii ṣe nikan.
It is the way of your people.	O jẹ ọna awọn eniyan rẹ.
Not with words, at least.	Kii ṣe pẹlu awọn ọrọ, o kere ju.
But he wanted more.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ diẹ sii.
You have to get back to work, he said.	O ni lati pada si iṣẹ, o sọ.
Nothing else is left.	Ko si ohun miiran ti o ku.
Make plans.	Ṣe awọn eto.
Those conditions have been going on for a long time.	Awọn ipo yẹn ti lọ fun igba pipẹ.
Remove from heat and let stand overnight.	Yọ kuro ninu ooru ki o jẹ ki o duro ni alẹ.
That’s the things you should always do.	Iyẹn ni awọn ohun ti o yẹ ki o ṣe nigbagbogbo.
If something were to come, the police would have found it.	Ti ohun kan ba wa lati wa, ọlọpa yoo ti rii.
She has gone home.	O ti lọ si ile.
That is not the question.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ibeere naa.
He began to look.	O si bẹrẹ si wo.
Make your own decisions.	Ṣe awọn ipinnu tirẹ.
At the same time, however, it is very understandable.	Ni akoko kanna, sibẹsibẹ, o jẹ oye julọ.
However, that is not what we are talking about here.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe ohun ti a n sọrọ nipa nibi.
I have no area at all.	Emi ko ni agbegbe kan rara.
All this will take time.	Gbogbo eyi yoo gba akoko.
I don't like it very much.	Emi ko fẹran rẹ pupọ.
I have not written it.	Emi ko ti kọ ọ.
He doesn’t expect to find much.	Ko nireti lati wa pupọ.
It made the day even more enjoyable.	O jẹ ki ọjọ naa dun diẹ sii.
It’s time to change things.	O to akoko lati yi awọn nkan pada.
I am sure they will not allow it.	O da mi loju pe won ko ni gba e laaye.
It was carried out.	O ti gbe jade.
But it is up to you.	Sugbon o wa si ọ.
The sisters are still unemployed and they have no money.	Arabinrin ko tun ni iṣẹ ati pe wọn ko ni owo.
He often goes to nightclubs.	Nigbagbogbo o lọ si awọn ibi ounjẹ alẹ.
I talk to people from the company.	Mo sọrọ si awọn eniyan lati ile-iṣẹ naa.
Which is pretty good for me.	Eyi ti o dara daradara fun mi.
Which again makes sense.	Eyi ti lẹẹkansi mu ki ori.
I take your time and my team time seriously.	Mo gba akoko rẹ ati akoko ẹgbẹ mi ni pataki.
We made them up.	A ṣe wọn soke.
Okay, not today.	O dara, kii ṣe loni.
Many of them do this for no good reason at all.	Pupọ ninu wọn ṣe eyi laisi idi to dara paapaa.
We have to keep.	A ni lati tọju.
Children are asked to sit down.	A beere awọn ọmọde joko jẹ.
Before the police came.	Ṣaaju ki awọn ọlọpa wa.
You know something great.	O mọ ohun nla kan.
It’s the best one right now.	O jẹ ọkan ti o dara julọ julọ ni bayi.
Not here well.	Ko si nibi daradara.
No need to do anything else.	Ko nilo lati ṣe ohunkohun miiran.
Have to go now.	Ni lati lọ ni bayi.
Do you think you can figure that out.	Ṣe o ro pe o le jade pe.
The thing is, it doesn’t.	Ohun naa ni, ko ṣe.
I have never thought of that before.	Emi ko ronu nipa iyẹn tẹlẹ.
Or don’t, and listen for yourself.	Tabi maṣe, ki o si gbọ fun ara rẹ.
Which makes me happy enough now.	Eyi ti o mu inu mi dun to ni bayi.
But it obviously happened.	Ṣugbọn o han gbangba pe o ṣẹlẹ.
My sister can talk to them.	Arabinrin mi le ba wọn sọrọ.
Lots of trees.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn igi.
No, it does not.	Rara, ko ṣe bẹẹ.
That may be what it means, and it may be true.	Iyẹn le jẹ ohun ti o tumọ si, ati pe o le jẹ otitọ.
Tom was the tallest boy in his class.	Tom jẹ ọmọkunrin ti o ga julọ ni kilasi rẹ.
We have a lot of other problems at the moment.	A ni ọpọlọpọ awọn iṣoro miiran ni akoko yii.
Or children.	Tabi iya yara.
People who sleep a little more eat more.	Awọn eniyan ti o sun diẹ diẹ jẹun diẹ sii.
Will of course use this function again.	Yoo dajudaju lo iṣẹ yii lẹẹkansi.
Note that these suggestions are not exhaustive.	Ṣe akiyesi pe awọn imọran wọnyi ko pari.
even so.	paapaa Nitorina.
You see, he loves the old house.	Ṣe o rii, o nifẹ ile atijọ.
There is nothing you can see that you do not like.	Ko si ohun ti o le ri ti o ko fẹ.
You can get any skills you want.	O le gba awọn ọgbọn eyikeyi ti o fẹ.
None of them, yourself.	Ko si wọn, funrararẹ.
Must see if anything has changed.	Gbọdọ rii boya ohunkohun ti yipada.
You must not go alone.	Iwọ ko gbọdọ lọ nikan.
Anything you have to say won’t make sense.	Ohunkohun ti o ni lati sọ yoo ko ṣe ori.
If you have one, that’s it.	Ti o ba ni ọkan, iyẹn ni.
These questions fit well.	Awọn ibeere wọnyi dara daradara.
As he stood, he looked at his friends.	Bi o ti duro, o wo awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
We have one of them.	A ni ọkan ninu wọn.
She looked at the men standing with her.	O wo awọn ọkunrin ti o duro pẹlu rẹ.
Want to continue.	Fẹ lati tẹsiwaju.
They are past the time of day, talking about the weather.	Wọn ti kọja akoko ti ọjọ, sọrọ nipa oju ojo.
I need a plan.	Mo nilo eto kan.
It’s what it seems to be.	O jẹ ohun ti o dabi ẹni pe o jẹ.
But think again.	Sugbon ro lẹẹkansi.
Very good, we will drop.	Dara pupọ, a yoo ju silẹ.
It is why many have moved.	O jẹ idi ti ọpọlọpọ ti gbe.
The issue is what happened after that.	Ọrọ naa ni ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ lẹhin iyẹn.
They passed through many abandoned houses.	Wọn kọja nipasẹ ọpọlọpọ awọn ile ti a kọ silẹ.
And the children.	Ati awọn ọmọ.
He knew there was another problem.	O mọ pe iṣoro miiran tun wa.
You can not do so with the whole picture.	O ko le ṣe bẹ pẹlu gbogbo aworan.
Just buy the book.	O kan ra iwe naa.
I'm sure you're tired, let's take a look.	O da mi loju pe o ti re, e je ki a wo inu re.
Start things working and let them go.	Bẹrẹ awọn nkan ṣiṣẹ ki o jẹ ki wọn lọ.
This can be very difficult for me.	Eyi le pupọ fun mi.
He could not have that.	Ko le ni iyẹn.
Look at the people there.	Wo eniyan ti o wa nibẹ.
It is used to increase energy.	O ti wa ni lo lati mu agbara.
She loves her ideas.	O nifẹ awọn ero rẹ.
I travel, a lot.	Mo rin irin-ajo, pupọ.
But he did not.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe.
But observations are not enough.	Ṣugbọn awọn akiyesi ko to.
And it's good.	Ati pe o dara.
It was great.	O je nla.
Remember, you have had a lot of time.	Ranti, o ti ni akoko pupọ.
I'm afraid of flying.	Mo bẹru ti fo.
And he got out of the car.	Ati pe o jade kuro ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
We need to cut teachers.	A nilo lati ge awọn olukọ.
There seems to be no time.	O dabi pe ko si akoko.
Here he works for only two hours a day.	Nibi o ṣiṣẹ fun wakati meji nikan ni ọjọ kan.
Just let it come into your own.	O kan jẹ ki o wa sinu tirẹ.
People expect to say a word.	Awọn eniyan nireti lati sọ ọrọ kan.
The most important issue is always the last.	Ọrọ ti o ṣe pataki julọ nigbagbogbo jẹ ti o kẹhin.
This cannot be changed.	Eyi ko le yipada.
We are here to kill you.	A wa nibi lati pa ọ.
He did not get out of bed for a week.	Ko dide kuro ni ibusun fun ọsẹ kan.
I would go for a local.	Emi yoo lọ fun agbegbe.
Many donations must be paid.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹbun gbọdọ wa ni san.
And we left with it.	Ati pe a kuro pẹlu rẹ.
I have a feeling it won’t happen in time.	Mo ni rilara pe kii yoo ṣe ni akoko.
It has even hit big people.	O ti lu awọn eniyan nla paapaa.
Not that you will know that.	Kii ṣe pe iwọ yoo mọ iyẹn.
My feet hurt.	Ẹsẹ mi dun.
I was scared all the time when he was alone.	Mo ti bẹru ni gbogbo igba nigbati o jẹ rẹ nikan.
And they love it.	Ati pe wọn nifẹ rẹ.
He is watching you.	O n wo o.
This raises questions.	Eyi gbe awọn ibeere dide.
He has a brother.	O ni arakunrin kan.
The children dropped out of school early.	Awọn ọmọde ti yọ kuro ni ile-iwe ni kutukutu.
He hopes.	O nireti.
Try to find out if they are also human.	Gbiyanju lati wa boya wọn tun jẹ eniyan.
Not because he thought he could walk all over me.	Kii ṣe nitori pe o ro pe o le rin lori gbogbo mi.
I'm just trying to help.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ṣe iranlọwọ nikan.
You do not even have to see.	Ko paapaa ni lati rii.
He could not keep himself out of it.	Ko le pa ara rẹ mọ kuro ninu rẹ.
We will let the matter out.	A yoo jẹ ki ọrọ naa jade.
Maybe age has the best thing in it.	Boya ọjọ ori ti ni ohun ti o dara julọ ninu rẹ.
And there is not much you can open.	Ati pe ko si ọpọlọpọ ti o le ṣii.
They stay like this for a long time.	Wọn duro bii eyi fun igba pipẹ.
Too much to understand what you are feeling.	Pupọ pupọ lati ni oye ohun ti o ni rilara.
Once you have eaten, it is time for bed.	Ni kete ti o ti jẹun, o to akoko fun ibusun.
Just explain on that before we go.	Kan ṣe alaye lori iyẹn ṣaaju ki a to lọ.
Turn again and make it into a ball.	Yipada lẹẹkansi ki o ṣe e sinu bọọlu kan.
He does not know.	Ko si mọ.
That's very good.	Iyẹn dara pupọ.
He was the son of the father.	O jẹ ọmọ baba naa.
He said nothing to anyone.	Ko so nkankan fun enikeni.
That is obvious.	Iyẹn han gbangba.
They couldn’t make more mistakes.	Wọn ko le ṣe aṣiṣe diẹ sii.
It started to fill the house two weeks ago.	O bẹrẹ lati kun ile ni ọsẹ meji sẹhin.
And it has nothing to do with anyone else.	Ati pe ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu ẹnikẹni miiran.
They hear only now because they are forced to.	Wọn gbọ nikan ni bayi nitori wọn fi agbara mu lati.
We are on the edge of something.	A wa lori eti nkan.
He wouldn’t go into the room, of course.	Oun yoo ko lọ sinu yara, dajudaju.
They are not very friendly.	Wọn kii ṣe ọrẹ pupọ.
More difficult questions may be necessary, however.	Awọn ibeere lile diẹ sii le jẹ pataki, sibẹsibẹ.
But it made me feel better.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ki ara mi dara.
He sent a letter.	O fi lẹta kan ranṣẹ.
Think about how it could be, if you are here right now.	Ronu bi o ṣe le jẹ, ti o ba wa nibi ni bayi.
It’s not the kind of place you want to be.	Kii ṣe iru ibi ti o fẹ lati wa.
That is my purpose.	Idi mi niyen.
Will let that night come, or continue after that.	Yoo jẹ ki alẹ yẹn wa, tabi tẹsiwaju lẹhin naa.
That will change soon.	Eyi yoo yipada laipẹ.
No one came through.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa nipasẹ.
And his feet.	Ati awọn ẹsẹ rẹ.
And just down the street.	Ati pe o kan ni isalẹ ita.
The process takes a lot of time.	Ọna naa gba akoko pupọ.
And make sure someone is taking pictures.	Ati rii daju pe ẹnikan n ya awọn aworan.
I have to tell them.	Mo gbọdọ sọ fun wọn.
She is my mother.	O ni iya mi.
He believes it is true.	O gbagbọ pe otitọ ni.
After that, make your way back to the place to express your thoughts.	Lẹhin iyẹn, ṣe ọna rẹ pada si ibi lati sọ ero rẹ.
You do not know anything about why you are here.	O ko mọ nkankan ti idi ti o wa nibi.
Children need to get dressed.	Awọn ọmọde nilo lati wọ aṣọ.
Now that you are here you must stay.	Ni bayi ti o wa nibi o gbọdọ duro.
Few people know what you think or who you are.	Diẹ si ẹnikan ko mọ ohun ti o ro tabi ẹniti o jẹ.
He asked to know what had happened.	O beere lati mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It was also the day my husband left me.	O tun jẹ ọjọ ti ọkọ mi fi mi silẹ.
It is getting very hot in my house.	O ti n gbona pupọ ninu ile mi.
He lives there.	Ti o ngbe nibẹ.
However, when they did, nothing happened.	Sibẹsibẹ, nigbati wọn ba ṣe, ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
The stories we tell are the stories of our lives.	Awọn itan ti a sọ jẹ awọn itan ti igbesi aye wa.
He just doesn't like it.	O kan ko fẹran rẹ.
The house is in a beautiful condition.	Ile naa wa ni ipo ti o lẹwa.
We promise to give it back in one piece.	A ṣe ileri lati da a pada ni nkan kan.
You do not think it is good enough.	O ko ro pe o dara to.
Whatever you have used.	Ohunkohun ti o ni o lo.
We love them, too.	A nifẹ wọn, paapaa.
That went on for many years.	Iyẹn lọ fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
Die with you.	Ku pẹlu rẹ.
If that is what you want.	Ti o ba jẹ ohun ti o fẹ.
He did not sit.	O ko joko.
And my son too.	Ati ọmọ mi pẹlu.
Attempt.	Gbiyanju.
He is with them now.	O wa pẹlu wọn ni bayi.
I have a simple task.	Emi ni o ni iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
No other person to see.	Ko si eniyan miiran lati ri.
That is not right.	Iyẹn ko tọ.
They all sit around you.	Gbogbo wọn joko ni ayika rẹ.
Give us that opportunity.	Fun wa ni anfani yẹn.
I wonder how that looks.	Mo Iyanu bawo ni iyẹn ṣe ri.
My body is not full.	Ara mi ko kun.
It is important to teach young people at this time.	O ṣe pataki lati kọ awọn ọdọ ni akoko yii.
That’s a lot, we can get.	Iyẹn pupọ, a le gba.
He wanted to get out there.	O fe lati jade nibẹ.
I can not wait.	Nko le duro.
It works across devices.	O ṣiṣẹ kọja awọn ẹrọ.
And for another reason, too.	Ati fun idi miiran, paapaa.
She was in love with him at first sight.	O ni ifẹ pẹlu rẹ ni oju akọkọ.
You can also be here.	O le tun wa nibi.
The industry is changing.	Ile-iṣẹ naa n yipada.
And one of the ways to look great is with beautiful hair.	Ati ọkan ninu awọn ọna lati wo nla jẹ pẹlu irun lẹwa.
It does not need another name at all.	Ko nilo orukọ miiran rara.
They are his side.	Wọn jẹ ẹgbẹ rẹ.
None of them speak.	Eyikeyi ninu wọn ko sọrọ.
And you have to do this first.	Ati pe o gbọdọ ṣe eyi ni igba akọkọ.
You can go the right way.	O le lọ si ọna ti o tọ.
I have no interest in it.	Emi ko ni anfani ninu rẹ.
You may even want them more than two seasons.	O le paapaa fẹ wọn diẹ sii ju akoko meji lọ.
To be alive we must know how to forget.	Lati wa laaye a ni lati mọ bi a ṣe le gbagbe.
It can be very difficult to change your life dramatically.	O le nira pupọ lati yi igbesi aye rẹ pada ni iyalẹnu.
We know that nothing can change the past.	A mọ pe ko si ohun ti o le yi ohun ti o ti kọja pada.
I do not accept that.	Emi ko gba iyẹn.
This is the best thing ever.	Eyi ni ohun ti o dara julọ lailai.
Yes it is true.	Bẹni o jẹ otitọ.
I left.	Mo pada kuro.
And in cash.	Ati ni owo.
We can work with any situation.	A le ṣiṣẹ pẹlu eyikeyi ipo.
So write it down.	Nitorina kọ ọ.
He was the wrong person.	O jẹ ẹni ti ko tọ.
They get that money back.	Wọn gba awọn owo yẹn pada.
Good to come back.	O dara lati pada wa.
One of many.	Ọkan ninu ọpọlọpọ.
This is a place.	Eleyi je ibi.
Better than nothing, for sure.	Dara ju ohunkohun, fun daju.
It was hot, so he decided to take the train.	O gbona, nitorina o pinnu lati gba ọkọ oju irin.
But maybe not.	Sugbon boya ko.
Feeling like home away from home in the week we stopped.	Rilara bi ile kuro ni ile ni ọsẹ ti a duro.
A city without music?	Ilu ti ko ni orin?
They locked the space down.	Wọn tii aaye naa si isalẹ.
The men arose.	Awọn ọkunrin dide.
They are here.	Wọn wa nibi.
He knew they knew something he had not done.	O mọ pe wọn mọ nkan ti ko ṣe.
Please take care of the children.	Jọwọ tọju awọn ọmọde.
Nothing is too much trouble for them.	Ko si ohun ti o jẹ wahala pupọ fun wọn.
I want someone to do such a thing for me.	Mo fẹ ki eniyan kan ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ fun mi.
But these are hard questions.	Ṣugbọn awọn wọnyi ni awọn ibeere lile.
At least that's what you think.	O kere ju iyẹn ni ohun ti o ro.
It was a really nice job.	O je kan gan dara iṣẹ.
More people buy the recipes.	Awọn eniyan diẹ sii ra awọn iwe ounjẹ naa.
Go to my car.	Lọ si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi.
That should be done.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o ṣe.
That may sound true, but it is not.	Iyẹn le dabi otitọ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe.
He sat on his seat a little better.	O joko lori ijoko rẹ diẹ dara julọ.
Sometimes you do, but for a while.	Nigba miiran o ṣe, ṣugbọn fun diẹ.
I should think about that.	Mo yẹ ki o ronu nipa iyẹn.
It takes passion to do something special.	O gba ife gidigidi lati ṣe nkan pataki.
Many others are going.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran n lọ.
So it started.	Nitorina o bẹrẹ.
I paid for my car.	A san ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi.
Most of my friends are married.	Pupọ julọ awọn ọrẹ mi ti ni iyawo.
I'm not sure if that's what you need.	Emi ko ni idaniloju boya ohun ti o nilo niyẹn.
This is not a good thing.	Eyi kii ṣe ohun ti o dara.
But he didn’t really want to talk to anyone.	Ṣugbọn ko fẹ pupọ lati ba ẹnikẹni sọrọ.
It was hard work.	O jẹ iṣẹ lile.
I was feeling good.	Mo ti rilara ti o dara.
I hope you are feeling better soon.	Mo nireti pe ara rẹ dara laipẹ.
We just do.	A kan ṣe.
He stayed with us for a while talking.	O duro pẹlu wa fun igba diẹ sọrọ.
I used to, myself.	Mo ti lo, ara mi.
That is the power of love.	Agbara ife niyen.
Use a few words!	Lo awọn ọrọ diẹ!
She is a girl.	O jẹ ọmọbirin.
Not even feeling.	Ko paapaa rilara.
Or at least, not as expected.	Tabi o kere ju, kii ṣe bi o ti ṣe yẹ.
You are in a good place.	O wa ni ibi ti o dara.
She buys it every day.	O ṣe ifẹ si i ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Things are not very good for us.	Awọn nkan ko dara pupọ fun wa.
The first time, and so many times after.	Ti igba akọkọ, ati ki ọpọlọpọ igba lẹhin.
We learn, but always too late.	A kọ ẹkọ, ṣugbọn nigbagbogbo pẹ ju.
How does that work?	Bawo ni iyẹn ṣe n ṣiṣẹ?
Which of course will make you even angrier.	Eyi ti dajudaju yoo jẹ ki o binu paapaa.
Any information you collect will be used for that purpose.	Alaye eyikeyi ti o gba yoo ṣee lo fun idi yẹn.
And our music, at least for a while, is good.	Ati orin wa, o kere ju fun igba diẹ, dara.
There is no chance to make sure their wishes are fulfilled.	Ko si anfani lati rii daju pe awọn ifẹ wọn wa.
You obviously enjoyed this.	O han gbangba pe o gbadun eyi.
It just happened.	O kan ṣẹlẹ.
There is another power.	Agbara miiran wa.
They sound out to the edge.	Wọn dun jade si eti.
You know what that would be.	O mọ kini iyẹn yoo jẹ.
It's worth what you pay for.	O tọ ohun ti o san fun.
You need time and rest.	O nilo akoko ati isinmi.
But it is not so, it does not even matter.	Ṣugbọn ko ri bẹ, paapaa ko ṣe pataki.
You go.	O lọ.
If it is simple.	Ti o ba jẹ pe o rọrun.
See what the girl did.	Wo ohun ti ọmọbirin naa ṣe.

But maybe, you should continue.	Ṣugbọn boya, o yẹ ki o tẹsiwaju.
Or for life, it seems.	Tabi fun igbesi aye, o dabi.
We are homeless.	A ko ni ile.
I would of course do and eat these again.	Emi yoo dajudaju ṣe ati jẹ awọn wọnyi lẹẹkansi.
I am serious.	Mo ṣe pataki.
I told him how your life could be.	Mo ti so fun u bi aye re ti le.
And not only that.	Kii ṣe eyi nikan.
It will make today much easier.	Yoo jẹ ki loni rọrun pupọ.
Everyone is talking about it.	Gbogbo eniyan n sọrọ nipa rẹ.
I think we need an office.	Mo ro pe a nilo ni ọfiisi.
Okay, will have to do.	O dara, yoo ni lati ṣe.
No player has more than two.	Ko si ẹrọ orin ti o ni ju meji lọ.
It has something.	O ni nkankan.
I still don’t know much about it.	Emi ko tun mọ pupọ nipa rẹ.
We want to work with people.	A fẹ lati ba awọn eniyan ṣiṣẹ.
It opens one of these books.	O ṣi ọkan ninu awọn iwe wọnyi.

They will not kill.	Won o pa.
We need to kill people to stay alive.	A nilo lati pa eniyan lati wa laaye.
They won’t have to work.	Wọn kii yoo ni lati ṣiṣẹ.
Her hair is missing.	Irun rẹ ti ko.
We expect a lot from our stories these days.	A nireti pupọ lati awọn itan wa ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
Not easy to find but see if you can.	Ko rọrun lati wa ṣugbọn wo ti o ba le.
And to grow children.	Ati lati dagba awọn ọmọde.
Not for your own good.	Kii ṣe fun anfani rẹ gaan.
You should stop and stand them out.	O yẹ ki o duro ati duro wọn jade.
It seems unlikely that they will meet again.	O dabi pe ko ṣeeṣe pe wọn yoo tun pade.
Can't say when.	Ko le sọ nigbawo.
I have been able to leave several times.	Mo ti le kuro ni igba pupọ.
On a lot of things you say no.	Lori ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan ti o sọ rara.
They want me.	Wọn fẹ mi.
They feel it slips away.	Wọn lero pe o yọ kuro.
I did it early today.	Mo ti ṣe ni kutukutu loni.
Men and women have the story.	Awọn ọkunrin ati awọn obinrin ni itan naa.
Some of them are personal.	Diẹ ninu wọn jẹ ti ara ẹni.
They killed me.	Wọn pa mi.
But make no mistake.	Ṣugbọn maṣe ṣe aṣiṣe.
I thought to myself.	Mo ro mi.
It gives you a lot of energy.	O fun ọ ni agbara pupọ.
I know they treat us like children.	Mo mọ pe wọn tọju wa bi awọn ọmọde.
For the first few days it worried me.	Fun awọn ọjọ diẹ akọkọ o ṣe aniyan mi.
No music, but sound.	Ko si orin, ṣugbọn ohun.
To love him.	Lati nifẹ rẹ.
Give him the book now.	Fun u ni iwe bayi.
At this point, you need someone to wait for you.	Ni akoko yii, o nilo ẹnikan lati duro fun u.
But that applies to your area of ​​understanding.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn n kan si agbegbe ti oye rẹ.
Like, the last way.	Bi, ọna kẹhin.
She looked at her hair.	O wo irun rẹ.
Where will the money come from?	Nibo ni owo naa yoo ti wa?
But the matter has taken its toll.	Ṣugbọn ọrọ naa ti gba igbesi aye tirẹ.
Standing in the way is not possible.	Duro ni ọna ko ṣeeṣe.
The teen years can be hard.	Awọn ọdun ọdọ le jẹ lile.
No one walked his way.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o rin ọna rẹ.
She is his favorite.	O jẹ ayanfẹ rẹ.
I don't give a shit.	Emi ko fun ni kan.
The same thing may be true for us, too.	Ohun kan naa le jẹ otitọ fun wa, paapaa.
He could not make me write anything.	Ko le ṣe mi kọ ohunkohun.
He never spoke, so others could hear.	O sọrọ rara, ki awọn miiran le gbọ.
Ask the people they have decided to talk to.	Beere awọn eniyan ti wọn ti pinnu lati sọrọ.
I didn’t tell him about the past.	Emi ko sọ fun u nipa ohun ti o ti kọja.
Give me money.	Fun mi ni owo.
In big cities, most people have a car.	Ni awọn ilu nla, ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
That is not true.	Iyẹn ko jẹ otitọ.
This is good news.	Eyi jẹ iroyin ti o dara.
Try shoes today.	Gbiyanju bata loni.
You just haven't met them yet.	O kan ko tii pade wọn sibẹsibẹ.
Sometimes there are up to three of them at a time.	Nigba miiran o to awọn mẹta ninu rẹ wa ni akoko kan.
Apparently he could never go down.	Ni gbangba ko le lọ silẹ lailai.
It comes down to law.	O wa si isalẹ lati ofin.
We returned for a long time.	A pada fun igba pipẹ.
Things can’t go on like that.	Awọn nkan ko le tẹsiwaju bi iyẹn.
At least three people were killed.	O kere ju eniyan mẹta ti pa.
Most cars take a day or so before they drive!	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ gba ọjọ kan tabi diẹ sii ṣaaju ki wọn wakọ!
They love children.	Wọn fẹran awọn ọmọde.
Sorry if this is not the case.	Ma binu ti eyi ba da ẹnikan loju.
Just sleep.	O kan sun.
It may be where they came from.	O le jẹ ibi ti wọn ti wa.
You will not see.	Iwọ kii yoo rii.
You will not believe this, but you are dead!	Iwọ kii yoo gbagbọ eyi, ṣugbọn o ti ku!
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Ma binu fun u ti iyalẹnu.
Don't be angry.	Maṣe binu.
He didn't believe it, not for a minute.	Ko gbagbọ, kii ṣe fun iṣẹju kan.
Something is wrong.	Nkankan ko tọ.
I go by many names.	Mo lọ nipasẹ ọpọlọpọ awọn orukọ.
Make sure	Rii daju
Another very simple reason to love.	Idi miiran ti o rọrun pupọ lati nifẹ.
Meet me at the station if you want to go.	Pade mi ni ibudo ti o ba fẹ lọ.
Want for money.	Fẹ fun owo.
The picture has changed.	Aworan naa ti yipada.
Nothing can be done without us.	Ko si ohun ti a le ṣe ko ṣee ṣe laisi wa.
It looks new.	O dabi tuntun.
I did not expect in a car.	Emi ko reti ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
In a big old bag, he said.	Ni apo atijọ nla kan, o sọ.
Whatever, do not be afraid.	Ohunkohun ti, ma ko bẹru.
It must be removed.	O gbọdọ yọ kuro.
It’s all going around.	Gbogbo rẹ ni lilọ ni ayika.
My family has been using this store for years.	Idile mi ti lo ile itaja yii fun awọn ọdun.
I would tell him he didn’t have to talk to me.	Emi yoo sọ fun u pe ko ni lati ba mi sọrọ.
She has hard work and needs help.	O ni iṣẹ lile ati pe o nilo iranlọwọ.
I must go.	Mo gbọdọ lọ.
He changed his mind.	O yi ori pada.
I get them can't just stop, he thought.	Mo gba wọn ko le da duro nikan, o ro.
In ancient times a child lived.	Ni igba atijọ ọmọ kan gbe.
People have been really great, they’ve got something from you.	Awọn eniyan ti jẹ nla gaan, wọn ti gba nkankan lati ọdọ rẹ.
You can not drink.	O ko le mu.
We do not need any money.	A ko nilo owo kankan.
Few people believe his story.	Awọn eniyan diẹ ni o gbagbọ itan rẹ.
I do not find it very easy to sleep.	Emi ko rii pe o rọrun pupọ lati sun.
It can turn to higher.	O le yipada si ga julọ.
She quickly ate her lunch.	O yara jẹ ounjẹ ọsan rẹ.
I love dad.	Mo feran baba.
So the same for me.	Nitorina kanna fun mi.
It was a clear day when we arrived.	O je kan ko o ọjọ nigba ti a de.
He started this new project without it.	O bẹrẹ iṣẹ tuntun yii laisi rẹ.
This is too small.	Eyi kere ju.
I have something else.	Emi ni nkan miiran.
We need to make sure the facts.	A nilo lati rii daju awọn otitọ.
Field rules here.	Awọn ofin aaye nibi.
I don’t know if that’s surprising.	Emi ko mọ boya iyẹn jẹ iyalẹnu.
Some of them have killed more than one person.	Diẹ ninu wọn ti pa diẹ sii ju eniyan kan lọ.
Here, in fact, the celebration is over.	Nibi, paapaa, ayẹyẹ naa ti pari.
As a system.	Bi awọn eto kan.
And he is looking for us.	Ati pe o n wa wa.
Good for me.	O dara fun mi.
The policeman started his car.	Ọlọpa naa bẹrẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ.
I don’t want that to mean, these ways.	Emi ko fẹ iyẹn tumọ si, awọn ọna wọnyi.
But he had nothing to do.	Ṣugbọn ko ni nkankan lati ṣe.
It means people will be killed.	O tumọ si pe eniyan yoo pa.
I don’t want to be one of those people.	Emi ko fẹ lati jẹ ọkan ninu awọn eniyan yẹn.
But we have found that there is a lot to do.	Ṣugbọn a ti rii pe ọpọlọpọ wa lati ṣe.
You just missed me.	Nikan o padanu mi.
It will not be so for a long time.	Kii yoo wa bẹ fun pipẹ.
They hope for a better home that they think they will have.	Wọn nireti ile ti o dara ti wọn ro pe wọn yoo ni.
You did well.	O ṣe daradara.
I'll just have a few minutes with you before.	Emi yoo kan ni iṣẹju diẹ pẹlu rẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
This fact should not be surprising.	Eyi ni otitọ ko yẹ ki o jẹ iyalẹnu.
Turn off the music.	Pa orin naa.
It almost seemed like he was back in school.	O fẹrẹ dabi pe o pada si ile-iwe.
He wants us to think there is time.	O fẹ ki a ro pe akoko wa.
I will sleep now.	Emi yoo sun ni bayi.
Few players attract as much attention as you do.	Diẹ awọn ẹrọ orin fa bi Elo akiyesi bi o ti ṣe.
It is personal.	Ti ara ẹni ni.
It remains alive as long as the system remains alive.	O wa laaye titi ti eto yoo fi wa laaye.
And it is water after all.	Ati pe o jẹ omi lẹhin gbogbo.
Sorry about that.	Ma binu nipa ohunkohun.
At one time the citizens considered this a problem.	Ni akoko kan awọn ara ilu ka eyi si wahala.
Children cannot accept.	Awọn ọmọde ko le gba.
We will handle this.	A yoo mu eyi.
You should see the news every day.	O yẹ ki o wo awọn iroyin ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Go back again.	Lọ sẹhin lẹẹkansi.
Stay in the car.	Duro ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
Ways, something, but there is nothing.	Awọn ọna, nkankan, ṣugbọn nibẹ ni ohunkohun.
We will have children.	A yoo bi ọmọ.
I have regained my strength.	Mo ti gba agbara mi pada.
They think they have their man.	Wọn ro pe wọn ni ọkunrin wọn.
It grew by a lot.	O dagba nipasẹ pupọ.
It was the top of the class.	O je oke ti awọn kilasi.
No, he did not.	Rara, ko ṣe bẹ.
He changed the car.	O yi ọkọ pada.
There is no other world.	Ko si aye miiran.
It does not say anything of what you have seen.	Ko sọ ohunkohun ti ohun ti o ti ri.
I feel like you are looking at me.	Mo lero pe o n wo mi.
I had to force myself to finish it.	Mo ni lati fi agbara mu ara mi lati pari rẹ.
I need to talk to him.	Mo nilo lati ba a sọrọ.
You can, we just have to continue.	O ti le, a kan ni lati tẹsiwaju.
Two observations about the test are appropriate.	Awọn akiyesi meji nipa idanwo naa yẹ.
Insert it into the system.	Fi sii sinu eto naa.
And with a woman like this on her side.	Ati pẹlu obinrin bii eyi ni ẹgbẹ rẹ.
You will never get out of your car.	Iwọ kii yoo jade kuro ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ rara.
At least, you think you have.	O kere ju, o ro pe o ni.
Again it will not be the same.	Tun ṣe kii yoo jẹ kanna.
Celebrations are on the way.	Awọn ayẹyẹ wa ni opopona.
In it he says.	Ninu rẹ o sọ pe.
But let’s give it a chance.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki a fun ni anfani.
We want to do the best we can.	A fẹ ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara julọ ti a le.
O fe e.	O fe e.
Try to hurry downstairs.	Gbiyanju lati yara ni isalẹ.
But then take a quick walk around.	Sugbon ki o si ya kan awọn ọna rin ni ayika.
Some people stopped.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan kan duro.
He is behind his money.	O wa lẹhin owo rẹ.
I have to go, or it will kill me.	Mo ni lati lọ, tabi o yoo pa mi.
This fact has been known for a long time.	Otitọ yii ti mọ fun igba pipẹ.
It lets you do things.	O jẹ ki o ṣe awọn nkan.
The journey is very long.	Irin-ajo naa gun pupọ.
There is no world.	Ko si aye.
The eyes become big.	Awọn oju di nla.
I have a family of love.	Mo ni ebi ife.
But let me tell you, of course it has caught my eye.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki n sọ fun ọ, dajudaju o ti di oju mi.
Nothing bad happened.	Ko si ohun buburu ti ṣẹlẹ.
I was able to write the program.	Mo ni anfani lati kọ eto naa.
Children grow around by love.	Awọn ọmọde dagba ni ayika nipasẹ ifẹ.
It made my job a lot easier. 	O jẹ ki iṣẹ mi rọrun pupọ. 
Any more questions?	Eyikeyi ibeere diẹ sii?
When.	Nigbawo.
Most of the men in the room went outside.	Pupọ ninu awọn ọkunrin ninu yara naa lọ si ita.
Good material to put together.	Ohun elo to dara lati fi papọ.
We see this happening again.	A n rii pe eyi n ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
He has made his time, though.	O ti ṣe akoko rẹ, bi o ti jẹ pe.
Naturally we are that.	Nipa ti a jẹ pe.
You could say it’s not great.	O le sọ pe kii ṣe nla.
The cat is by the fire.	Ologbo naa jẹ nipasẹ okun ina.
He wants to make you bad.	O fẹ ki o ṣe ọ ni buburu.
Let me know if the question does not appear.	Jẹ ki mi mọ ti ibeere naa ko ba han.
Come, walk with me.	Wa, rin pẹlu mi.
See text for details.	Fun alaye wo ọrọ.
This area has been around since ancient times.	Agbegbe yii ti wa lati igba atijọ.
Someone asked about me.	Ẹnikan ti o beere nipa mi.
This is the reason.	Idi ni eyi.
That will not happen on my watch.	Iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ lori aago mi.
And it's not right to do bad.	Ati pe ko tọ lati ṣe buburu.
Last summer was the best we’ve had.	Igba ooru to kọja ni o dara julọ ti a ti ni.
That’s not how the names work.	Iyẹn kii ṣe bi awọn orukọ ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
He would think of everything before opening his mouth.	Oun yoo ronu ohun gbogbo ṣaaju ki o to ṣii ẹnu rẹ.
He will do anything for you.	Oun yoo ṣe ohunkohun fun ọ.
He is not married.	O ti ko iyawo.
But if it does not work, try another doctor.	Ṣugbọn ti ko ba ṣiṣẹ, gbiyanju dokita miiran.
People living at home do not worry about food.	Awọn eniyan ti o ngbe ni ile ko ṣe aniyan nipa ounjẹ.
They use that power.	Wọn lo agbara naa.
There are no problems with the environment.	Ko si awọn iṣoro pẹlu ayika.
And we want that to happen this year.	Ati pe a fẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ ni ọdun yii.
He broke into the room.	O ya sinu yara.
You just want to get home.	O kan fẹ lati de ile.
Perhaps they will consider other reasons for their position.	Boya wọn yoo ronu awọn idi miiran fun ipo wọn.
Same as you.	Kanna bi iwọ.
And they’re getting something.	Ati pe wọn n gba ohun kan.
You just need to grow a little.	O kan nilo lati dagba diẹ.
It cannot be so.	Ko le jẹ bẹ.
Do nothing to get back to that.	Ṣe ohunkohun lati pada si iyẹn.
It would seem correct.	Yoo dabi pe o tọ.
I can't say when.	Nko le so nigbawo.
Teams were briefed for the project.	A ṣe alaye awọn ẹgbẹ fun iṣẹ naa.
The reason, however, seems to be a matter of money.	Idi, sibẹsibẹ, dabi pe o jẹ ọrọ ti owo.
I want you to stop.	Mo fe ki e da duro.
We are not strong.	A ko ni okun.
Or they could be.	Tabi wọn le jẹ.
He could not get the job the way he wanted.	Ko le gba iṣẹ naa ni ọna ti o fẹ.
Understand what it means.	Loye ohun ti o tumọ si.
That was that night.	Iyẹn wa ni alẹ yẹn.
He refused to go.	O kọ lati lọ.
That tells us two things.	Ohun meji niyẹn sọ fun wa.
It could also be more.	O le tun jẹ diẹ sii.
But the city will want more.	Ṣugbọn ilu naa yoo fẹ diẹ sii.
And it is also very hot.	Ati pe o tun gbona pupọ.
A minute goes by.	Iṣẹju kan n lọ.
Parents fill out a questionnaire.	Awọn obi kun iwe ibeere kan.
No, no, you missed.	Rara, rara, o padanu.
But even that is not all.	Ṣugbọn paapaa iyẹn kii ṣe gbogbo rẹ.
It is true.	Otitọ ni.
I do not know what is the matter with me.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o jẹ ọrọ pẹlu mi.
They love it.	Wọn fẹran rẹ.
I want to live with it.	Mo fẹ lati gbe pẹlu rẹ.
He did not want to go with it.	Oun ko fẹ lọ pẹlu rẹ.
We all think we can have any woman we want.	Gbogbo wa ro pe a le ni eyikeyi obinrin ti a fẹ.
Something special, he said.	Nkankan pataki, o sọ.
I'll do it under the hood.	Emi yoo ṣe labẹ ile naa.
He did not say anything about his family's past.	Ko sọ ọrọ kankan nipa ohun ti o ti kọja ti idile rẹ.
Some love it, while others hate it.	Diẹ ninu awọn nifẹ rẹ, nigba ti awọn miiran korira rẹ.
Can't figure out why it is.	Ko le ro ero idi ti o jẹ.
Two years passed.	Ọdun meji kan kọja.
I sold myself.	Mo ta ara mi.
It's too hot for me today.	O gbona ju fun mi loni.
It may or may not be true.	O le tabi ko le jẹ otitọ.
Some others want to get out of their hands.	Awọn miiran kan fẹ lati gba kuro ni ọwọ wọn.
Seeing that brother is important to me is hard.	Ri pe arakunrin ṣe pataki fun mi ni lile.
But he knew the song.	Ṣugbọn o mọ orin naa.
He stays with me.	O duro pẹlu mi.
Sorry we left you.	Ma binu pe a fi ọ silẹ.
He will not return to his former place, either.	Oun kii yoo pada si ibiti o ti wa tẹlẹ, boya.
So try.	Nitorina gbiyanju.
And lose, on purpose.	Ati ki o padanu, lori idi.
Pictures are available.	Awọn aworan wa lati wa.
Go get it now !.	Lọ gba ni bayi!.
It happens every year.	O ṣẹlẹ ni gbogbo ọdun.
Children should put things back in their place.	Awọn ọmọde yẹ ki o fi awọn nkan pada si ipo wọn.
But you know this is not how we live.	Ṣugbọn o mọ eyi kii ṣe bii a ṣe gbe.
That doesn’t stop at the word.	Eyi ko duro ni ọrọ.
I can live in my car as well.	Mo le gbe ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi pẹlu.
Do not pay attention to what other people say.	Maṣe ṣe akiyesi ohun ti awọn eniyan miiran sọ.
We take a year off at one point.	A gba isinmi ọdun kan ni aaye kan.
They plan to stay here for a few months.	Wọn gbero lati duro nibi fun oṣu diẹ.
We have helped them in many ways, so far.	A ti ran wọn lọwọ ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna, titi di akoko yii.
I know you will be angry.	Mo mọ pe iwọ yoo binu.
That world has changed.	Aye yẹn ti yipada.
I became a person who was not me.	Mo di eniyan ti kii ṣe emi.
I do not want to go.	Emi ko fẹ lati lọ.
He could not leave the small house.	Ko le kuro ni ile kekere naa.
We just outside the players coming all the time.	A o kan ni ita awọn ẹrọ orin bọ ni gbogbo awọn akoko.
I promise to give you your old car.	Mo ti ṣe ileri lati fun ọ ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ atijọ rẹ.
Make up your own.	Ṣe soke ti ara rẹ.
Lunch included.	Ounjẹ ọsan wa pẹlu.
You just have to find the right place to be.	O kan ni lati wa aaye ti o tọ lati wa.
And we have to tell the truth about that.	Ati pe a ni lati sọ otitọ nipa iyẹn.
Maybe you should go to one.	Boya o yẹ ki o lọ si ọkan.
Stories must travel from place to place and from time to time.	Awọn itan gbọdọ rin irin-ajo lati ibi de ibi ati akoko si akoko.
He is looking at me.	O n wo mi.
That's your business.	Iṣẹ rẹ niyẹn.
The houses around the school are gone.	Awọn ile ti o wa ni ayika ile-iwe ti lọ.
But there are no new ones.	Ṣugbọn ko ni awọn tuntun kankan.
That was me three months ago.	Iyẹn jẹ mi ni oṣu mẹta sẹhin.
Time is enough and you need to do it.	Akoko ti to ati pe o nilo lati ṣe.
As soon as he could, he saw it again.	Ni kete bi o ti le, o tun ri i.
You do the best you can, and hopefully.	O ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ ti o le, ati nireti.
Can get.	Le gba.
Other than that, this does.	Miiran ju iyẹn lọ, eyi ṣe.
I just say yes.	Mo kan sọ ni.
Maybe so.	Boya o jẹ bẹ.
People quit their jobs.	Awọn eniyan fi iṣẹ silẹ.
I can be sure you have someone to look after you.	Mo le rii daju pe o ni ẹnikan lati wo ẹhin rẹ.
So we forced ourselves to get up and walk home.	Nitorina a fi agbara mu ara wa lati dide ki a rin ile.
She loves men.	O feran awọn ọkunrin.
I know there is a world of that.	Mo mọ pe aye wa ti iyẹn.
I will read another book.	Emi yoo tun ka iwe kan.
The cost of equipment is not.	Iye owo awọn ẹrọ ko si.
You can not see.	O ko le ri.
They do not read.	Wọn ko ka.
He did not tell me the whole story.	Ko so fun mi gbogbo itan.
He is alone.	O wa nikan.
As soon as they did, he sold them.	Ni kete ti wọn ba ṣe, o ta wọn.
I made a lot of mistakes.	Mo ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn aṣiṣe.
From top to bottom.	Lati oke de isalẹ.
Maybe you see the past.	Boya o rii ohun ti o ti kọja.
The great areas of this great city have no water.	Awọn agbegbe nla ti ilu nla yii ko ni omi.
But we do not make life.	Ṣugbọn a ko ṣe aye.
This is amazing.	Eyi jẹ iyanu.
What you do, and who you are.	Ohun ti o ṣe, ati awọn ti o ba wa ni.
I refuse to be serious all the time.	Mo kọ lati ṣe pataki ni gbogbo igba.
The car looks like a boot.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa dabi apoti bata.
We want to do it right.	A fẹ ṣe o tọ.
Their lives changed forever.	Igbesi aye wọn yipada lailai.
This is a big problem in many families.	Eyi jẹ iṣoro nla ni ọpọlọpọ awọn idile.
But it's fun.	Sugbon o ni fun.
I am in public.	Mo wa ni gbangba.
So, we arrived at the first room.	Nitorina, a de ibi si yara akọkọ.
No one was running.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sare.
You don’t want to know anyone like me, he said.	O ko fẹ mọ ẹnikẹni bi emi, o sọ.
I will repay you.	Emi yoo san pada fun ọ.
We do this for two main reasons.	A ṣe eyi fun awọn idi pataki meji.
You know them.	O mọ wọn jẹ.
Do not change anything.	Maṣe yi nkan pada.
We get that way here.	A gba ọna yẹn nibi.
We just have to.	A kan ni lati.
I want you to go.	Mo fẹ ki o lọ.
He forced us to come.	O fi agbara mu wa lati wa.
But it does not attract people interest.	Sugbon o ko si fa awon eniyan anfani.
It is no easier than that.	Ko rọrun diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
And he needs me.	O si nilo mi.
However, there are people who are not qualified to work at all ages.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn eniyan wa ti ko yẹ lati ṣiṣẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ ori.
As the sun rises, people go to work.	Bi oorun ti n dide, awọn eniyan lọ si iṣẹ.
But we are there now.	Sugbon a ti wa nibẹ ni bayi.
If you want.	Ti o ba fẹ.
I reached the place and placed my hand on his face.	Mo de ibi mo si gbe ọwọ mi le oju rẹ.
But this water.	Sugbon omi yi.
I'm glad you did.	Inu mi dun pe o ṣe.
You did well.	O ṣe daradara.
Power is personal and community.	Agbara jẹ ti ara ẹni ati agbegbe.
It is easy to use.	O rọrun lati lo.
I need to.	Mo nilo lati.
Receive as a great gift for yourself.	Gba bi ẹbun nla fun ara rẹ.
It's over.	O ti pari.
I can not do anything.	Nko le se nkankan.
Maybe it's time to change.	Boya o to akoko lati yipada.
He always had his back to the company.	O nigbagbogbo ni ẹhin rẹ si ile-iṣẹ naa.
But the doctrine of one is not something we are born with.	Ṣugbọn ẹkọ ti ọkan kii ṣe nkan ti a bi pẹlu.
I see so.	Mo ri bẹ.
But it seemed too much, too fast.	Sugbon o dabi enipe pupo ju, ju sare.
We went on the road.	A lọ loju ọna.
You can not force it.	O ko le fi agbara mu.
Outside, the heat of the sun is rising.	Ni ita, ooru ti oorun n dagba.
It was an amazing world to visit.	O jẹ aye iyalẹnu lati ṣabẹwo si.
Best to do before the baby leaves.	Dara julọ lati ṣe ṣaaju ki ọmọ naa lọ kuro.
Good.	O dara.
It is so.	O ri bẹ bẹ.
For me it was love at first sight.	Fun mi o jẹ ifẹ ni oju akọkọ.
And of course that would be a problem.	Ati pe dajudaju iyẹn yoo jẹ iṣoro kan.
I even used under my eyes.	Mo paapaa lo labẹ oju mi.
They learn to make their beds better.	Wọn kọ ẹkọ lati ṣe ibusun wọn daradara.
You should love the opportunity to talk to him.	O yẹ ki o nifẹ anfani lati ba a sọrọ.
He is writing a book about ancient history.	O n kọ iwe kan nipa itan igba atijọ.
We have already passed this.	A ti kọja eyi tẹlẹ.
I asked how much they did.	Mo beere iye ti wọn ṣe.
He did not expect that.	Ko nireti iyẹn.
Truth and method.	Otitọ ati ọna.
And he put his ear to his mouth.	O si fi eti rẹ si ẹnu rẹ.
We do not know how to help them.	A ko mọ bi a ṣe le ran wọn lọwọ.
It's necessary.	Ko yẹ.
We are on the game.	A wa lori ere naa.
Or what it looks like.	Tabi kini o dabi.
Do it better.	Ṣe o dara julọ.
A friend did just that.	Ọ̀rẹ́ bẹ́ẹ̀ kan ṣe bẹ́ẹ̀.
I turned my attention away.	Mo yi akiyesi mi kuro.
I know you did it for me.	Mo mọ pe o ṣe fun mi.
But it is not a physical thing.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe nkan ti ara.
You know where the materials come from, how they are put together.	O mọ ibi ti awọn ohun elo ti wa, bawo ni a ṣe fi wọn papọ.
A door opens.	Ilẹkun kan ṣi.
He did not express any opinion.	O ko so ero eyikeyi.
People say it will be obvious.	Awọn eniyan sọ pe yoo han gbangba.
It rains.	Ojo ro.
It is in range.	O wa ni ibiti o wa.
No need to know, he said to himself.	Ko nilo lati mọ, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
I have the opportunity to learn under it and its methods.	Mo ni aye lati kọ ẹkọ labẹ rẹ ati awọn ọna rẹ.
The type is no longer known.	Iru iru ko si mọ.
In front of you.	Ni iwaju rẹ.
He was one of my men.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọkunrin mi.
I would like to be on one side.	Emi yoo fẹ lati wa ni ẹgbẹ kan.
Not to make up.	Ko lati ṣe soke.
They just do.	Wọn kan ṣe.
You need to wash your clothes.	O nilo lati fo awọn aṣọ rẹ.
This was his own life.	Eleyi je ara rẹ aye.
He will never come back.	O ko ni pada wa.
And sometimes they are not.	Ati nigba miiran wọn kii ṣe.
I beg you to return to your area.	Mo bẹ ọ lati fi pada si agbegbe rẹ.
He made a statement on solar energy.	O sọ ọrọ kan lori agbara oorun.
We will not wait for this.	A kii yoo duro fun eyi.
Can you believe it?	Ṣe o le gbagbọ?
However, there is nothing to worry about.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko si nkankan lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
Take a seat, my man.	Gba ijoko, ọkunrin mi.
The important thing is that they start well.	Ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni pe wọn bẹrẹ daradara.
At least it's hot.	O kere o gbona.
No one was found at the time.	Ko si ọkan ti a ri ni akoko yẹn.
Read this book, and download it again.	Ka iwe yii, ki o si tun gba.
This is how it goes, he said.	Eyi jẹ bi o ti n lọ, o sọ.
And no one is going to stop my stuff, either.	Ati pe ko si ẹnikan lati da nkan mi jẹ, boya.
But they are gone now.	Ṣugbọn wọn ti lọ ni bayi.
You need to clear your head.	O nilo lati ko ori rẹ kuro.
In this book we will do the same.	Ninu iwe yii a yoo ṣe kanna.
It feels bad for you.	O lero buburu fun ọ.
Maybe she'll tell him something like this.	Boya o yoo sọ fun u nkankan bi eyi.
He stood up last night.	O duro soke ni alẹ kẹhin.
They don’t want to look, you know.	Wọn ko fẹ lati wo, o mọ.
People around me are killing him.	Awọn eniyan ti o wa ni ayika mi n pa a.
I know him from the story.	Mo mọ rẹ lati itan naa.
To everyone out there who has tried.	Si gbogbo eniyan jade nibẹ ti o ti gbiyanju.
But there is nothing you can do about it.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o le ṣe nipa rẹ.
And that’s exactly what they continue to do.	Ati pe iyẹn ni wọn ṣe tẹsiwaju paapaa.
Ever since her mother died.	Lati igba ti iya rẹ ti ku.
Books lost because of it.	Awọn iwe ti a padanu nitori rẹ.
Small right in me neither.	Kekere tọ ninu mi bẹni.
We need stories that come through us, but for everyone.	A nilo awọn itan ti o wa nipasẹ wa, ṣugbọn fun gbogbo eniyan.
At this point, the idea is very simple.	Ni aaye yii, ero naa rọrun pupọ.
Something is right about that.	Nkankan wa ti o tọ nipa.
And they are still there.	Ati pe wọn tun wa.
You know what to expect now.	O mọ ohun ti yoo reti ni bayi.
Schools can use a lot more attention even.	Ile-iwe le lo akiyesi pupọ diẹ sii paapaa.
With two or three good teams always even.	Pẹlu awọn ẹgbẹ meji tabi mẹta ti o dara nigbagbogbo paapaa.
I always enjoy when you stay.	Mo gbadun nigbagbogbo nigbati o ba duro.
We are here to make it easy for you.	A wa nibi lati jẹ ki o rọrun fun ọ.
This is a great help in the future.	Eyi jẹ iranlọwọ nla ni ọjọ iwaju.
Keep your mouth shut, look, and listen.	Pa ẹnu rẹ mọ, wo, ki o gbọ.
The family had a family photo taken the previous day.	Idile naa ni aworan idile ti o ya ni ọjọ ti o ṣaaju.
So much can go wrong.	Ki Elo le lọ ti ko tọ.
Parents know their child.	Awọn obi mọ ọmọ wọn.
So something is wrong.	Nitorina ohun kan jẹ aṣiṣe.
The car parked outside here.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o duro si ita nibi.
She decided to go back to school.	O pinnu lati pada si ile-iwe.
Here are some ways you can do so.	Eyi ni diẹ ninu awọn ọna ti o le ṣe bẹ.
I got up.	Mo ti gba oke.
You never know what the situation will be.	O ko mọ kini ipo naa yoo jẹ.
It may rain.	Ojo le.
He is with me.	O wa pẹlu mi.
A large space is an opportunity for people outside the community.	Aaye nla kan ni anfani fun eniyan ni ita agbegbe.
They do not have to cut them into small pieces.	Wọn ko ni lati ge wọn ni kekere.
One cannot buy services alone.	Eniyan ko le ra awọn iṣẹ nikan.
Apparently she was one of those girls.	O han ni o jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọmọbirin naa.
It is hard to make money.	O ti wa ni gidigidi lati ṣe owo.
Here again it is near the work.	Nibi lẹẹkansi o wa nitosi iṣẹ naa.
There is no better time than now.	Ko si akoko ti o dara ju bayi lọ.
One month, a man goes to the store for groceries.	Ni oṣu kan, eniyan kan lọ si ile itaja fun awọn ohun elo ounjẹ.
They were photographed in front of the plane.	Wọn ya aworan ni iwaju ọkọ ofurufu naa.
Make it nice and durable.	Mu ọ dara ati ti o tọ.
They seemed to be laughing.	Wọn dabi ẹni pe wọn rẹrin.
He won many.	O si gba ọpọlọpọ awọn.
Their car hit a tree, killing their little girl.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wọn lu igi kan, ti o pa ọmọbirin wọn kekere.
My friends have not seen him for a week.	Awọn ọrẹ mi ko tii ri i fun ọsẹ kan.
And, it matters to me.	Ati pe, o ṣe pataki fun mi.
Don't just read it.	Maṣe ka rẹ nikan.
And what a great idea this is.	Ati pe imọran nla wo ni eyi jẹ.
That my voice deserves to be heard.	Pe ohun mi yẹ lati gbọ.
It has been going bad lately.	O ti wa ni ọna buburu laipẹ.
Good question!	Ibeere to dara!
And it was not enough to keep him.	Ati pe ko ti to lati tọju fun u.
They are made for money.	Wọn ṣe fun owo.
At first, they didn't buy anything.	Ni akọkọ, wọn ko ra ohunkohun.
I need clothes and he gave me.	Mo nilo aṣọ ati pe o fun mi.
I can’t do that completely.	Emi ko le ṣe iyẹn patapata.
As not a big deal.	Bi kii ṣe nkan nla.
When the water is hot, it evaporates.	Nigbati omi ba gbona, o yọ kuro.
They are very good.	Wọn dara pupọ.
They are many.	Wọn ti wa ni ọpọlọpọ.
You have to agree to the rules.	O gbọdọ gba si awọn ofin.
We still have a lot of work to do.	A tun ni ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ lati ṣe.
He told the story.	O sọ itan naa.
This has now changed.	Eyi ti yipada bayi.
The world says stop that.	Aye sọ pe da iyẹn duro.
It was before his time, but he knew the story.	O jẹ ṣaaju akoko rẹ, ṣugbọn o mọ itan naa.
I started well enough.	Mo bẹrẹ daradara to.
The crisis began last month.	Wahala naa bẹrẹ ni oṣu to kọja.
A man sure at the work station.	Ọkunrin kan daju ni ibudo iṣẹ.
Your body hears all your thoughts.	Ara rẹ gbọ gbogbo ero rẹ.
I have a feeling that you will say something like that.	Mo ni rilara pe iwọ yoo sọ nkan bii iyẹn.
At least this should be tried.	O kere ju eyi yẹ ki o gbiyanju.
It looks like it but not so much.	O dabi oun ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ.
My eyes too.	Oju ti mi ju.
There your friend.	Nibẹ ni ọrẹ rẹ.
You want to talk to both.	O fẹ lati ba awọn mejeeji sọrọ.
This is a very common mistake.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe aṣiṣe pupọ.
The baby was born recently.	Ọmọ naa ti bi laipẹ.
I didn’t grow up like that.	Emi ko dagba bi iyẹn.
Very good for me.	O dara pupọ fun mi.
It stands out for two other reasons.	O duro jade fun idi meji miiran.
It is now or not.	O jẹ bayi tabi rara.
So, when will it go?	Nitorina, nigbawo ni yoo lọ?
I know it will be difficult to talk about.	Mo mọ pe yoo nira lati sọrọ nipa.
I should not think it was true.	Emi ko yẹ ki o ro pe o jẹ otitọ.
Soon they celebrated the tenth year.	Laipẹ wọn ṣe ayẹyẹ ọdun kẹwa.
That, you think, is completely possible.	Iyẹn, o ro pe, ṣee ṣe patapata.
Tell this story to us.	So itan yii fun ara wa.
I need to come.	Mo nilo lati wa.
I get a lot.	Mo gba pupọ.
Do not cut it properly.	Maṣe ge o daradara.
There is a possibility.	O ṣeeṣe kan wa.
Pretty good, don’t you think ?.	Lẹwa dara, ṣe o ko ro?.
However there are some issues that are very important.	Sibẹsibẹ awọn ọrọ kan wa ti o ṣe pataki julọ.
There is no real father there.	Ko si baba otitọ kan nibẹ.
They know each other well.	Wọn ti mọ ara wọn daradara.
Okay, that doesn’t make sense.	O dara, iyẹn ko ṣe oye.
I have a letter from you.	Mo ni lẹta kan lati ọdọ rẹ.
They are most interested in making you money.	Wọn ni anfani julọ ni ṣiṣe ọ ni owo.
He arrived at the station late.	O de ibudo naa pẹ.
You do it every day.	O ṣe ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Something must come with the mother.	Nkankan gbọdọ wa pẹlu iya naa.
And they need to get both men out.	Ati pe wọn nilo lati gba awọn ọkunrin mejeeji jade.
I have written it well.	Mo ti kọ ọ daradara.
We do not know.	A ko mọ.
Two turns, that would be enough.	Yipada meji, iyẹn yoo to.
You don’t want to get any of this.	O ko fẹ lati gba eyikeyi ninu eyi.
Play three games.	Mu awọn ere mẹta ṣiṣẹ.
He wanted nothing to do with it.	Ko fe nkankan lati se pẹlu rẹ.
It was written on his face.	O ti kọ si oju rẹ.
You just can't help it.	O kan ko le ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
But what does it mean?	Ṣugbọn kini o tumọ si?
It does not mean that they have any real significance.	Ko tumọ si pe wọn ni otitọ eyikeyi pataki.
They don’t like to talk about it.	Wọn ko nifẹ lati sọrọ nipa rẹ.
He said he would not take another girl with a child.	O sọ pe oun ko ni mu ọmọbirin miiran pẹlu ọmọde kan.
Clear my head.	Ko ori mi kuro.
I need to go shopping today.	Mo nilo lati lọ si ile itaja loni.
They left.	Wọn fi silẹ.
Is this correct ?.	Ṣe eyi tọ?.
He hated the way he even looked.	O korira bi o ti n wo paapaa.
Try to know who these people are.	Gbiyanju lati mọ ẹni ti awọn eniyan wọnyi jẹ.
Iya even.	Iya paapaa.
Do just that.	Ṣe o kan.
It should help a lot.	O yẹ ki o ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
It can be very for men.	O le pupọ fun awọn ọkunrin.
That’s what you got out after.	Ti o ni ohun ti o ni jade lẹhin.
He is my life, this is my life.	Oun ni igbesi aye mi, eyi ni igbesi aye mi.
That may be a little less.	Iyẹn le jẹ diẹ ti o kere julọ.
Today, it is not so.	Loni, kii ṣe bẹ.
You know, these situations go up and down.	O mọ, awọn ipo wọnyi lọ si oke ati isalẹ.
When this happens, the car no longer has a reason.	Nigbati eyi ba ṣẹlẹ, ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ko ni idi kan mọ.
No one is there.	Ko si ẹnikan nibẹ.
We are waiting, and we are watching.	A n duro de, a si n wo.
Maybe there are two reasons for it.	Boya awọn idi meji ni o wa fun rẹ.
He's a big brother.	Arakunrin nla ni.
I moved.	Mo ti gbe.
Whatever it was, this man was clear.	Ohunkohun ti o je, ọkunrin yi je ko o.
He’s in the running.	O wa ninu ṣiṣe.
I went to sit with him.	Mo lọ joko pẹlu rẹ.
No one is easy to think of.	Ko si ọkan ti o rọrun lati ronu.
We became really good friends this year.	A di gan ti o dara ọrẹ odun yi.
I do not want to use it.	Nko fe e lo.
You used to read.	O lo lati ka.
One week passed.	Ọsẹ kan kọja.
Back to workbook.	Pada si iwe iṣẹ.
Just don’t try to move.	O kan maṣe gbiyanju lati gbe.
He did not lock it.	Ko tii i.
Knowing what you know is not hard if you use it yourself.	Mọ ohun ti o mọ kii ṣe lile ti o ba lo ara rẹ.
You're struggling with something.	O n gbiyanju pẹlu nkan kan.
It starts at the bottom.	O bẹrẹ ni isalẹ.
Here it is.	Nibi o wa.
You just can't see them.	O kan ko le rii wọn.
Tell me what you think.	Sọ ohun ti o ro fun mi.
We must tell him about this.	A gbọdọ sọ fun u nipa eyi.
Just try to help.	O kan gbiyanju lati ran.
Now they arrived, when all the trouble was over.	Bayi wọn de, nigbati gbogbo wahala ti pari.
However, this is not necessary.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi kii ṣe pataki.
Every woman wants.	Gbogbo obinrin fẹ.
And he will accept.	Oun yoo si gba.
The kind you need from a good friend.	Iru ti o nilo lati ọdọ ọrẹ to dara.
It is almost anything we can do.	O fẹrẹ jẹ ohunkohun ti a le ṣe.
Need to have a car.	Nilo lati ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
Here is what we want to do about it.	Eyi ni ohun ti a fẹ ṣe nipa rẹ.
You do not know what is required.	O ko mọ ohun ti a beere.
You can’t communicate with bad people.	O ko le ṣe alaye pẹlu awọn eniyan buburu.
Maybe this is not a question to ask you.	Boya eyi kii ṣe ibeere lati beere lọwọ rẹ.
I gave you all the attention while you were here.	Mo ti fun ọ ni gbogbo akiyesi nigba ti o ti wa nibi.
An old thing we saw.	Ohun atijọ ti a ri.
Ask for help.	Beere fun iranlọwọ.
None of them said anything.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o sọ nkan kan.
For whatever time they have.	Fun ohunkohun ti akoko ti won ni.
Not great physically.	Kii ṣe nla ni ti ara.
It makes no sense that we ended up as a team, either.	Ko si ori pe a ti pari bi ẹgbẹ kan, boya.
I have enough.	Mo ti gba to.
He photographed her dead.	O ya aworan rẹ pe o ti ku.
The journey was hard but rewarding.	Irin-ajo naa jẹ lile ṣugbọn o ni ere.
He shook his head in disbelief.	O mi ori rẹ ni imọran.
No, not them.	Rara, kii ṣe wọn.
I knew the boy heard everything he said.	Mo mọ pe ọmọ naa gbọ ohun gbogbo ti o sọ.
Tell me.	Sọ fun mi.
The things we do to the world are.	Awọn ohun ti a ṣe si aye ni.
I could not believe my eyes.	Emi ko le gbagbọ oju ara mi.
There is no inside, or outside in this situation.	Ko si inu, tabi ita ni ipo yii.
They can find good ways to get this.	Wọn le wa awọn ọna daradara lati gba eyi.
In fact, it is better to wait.	Ni otitọ, o dara julọ lati duro.
We come a long way.	A wa ọna pipẹ.
Either it makes you happy or it makes you kill yourself.	Boya o mu inu rẹ dun tabi mu ki o pa ara rẹ.
You have a little more clear ideas.	O ni kekere kan diẹ ko o ero.
We were in love.	A wà ni ife.
I can find my way back.	Mo le wa ọna mi pada.
That is below.	Iyẹn wa ni isalẹ.
No one knows anyone there.	Ko si mọ ẹnikan nibẹ.
You can not do both.	O ko le ṣe awọn mejeeji.
I want you to be with me.	Mo fẹ ki o wa pẹlu mi.
Don't even mention my name.	Maṣe sọ orukọ mi paapaa.
Need to eat so you can be able to sleep.	Nilo lati jẹun ki o le ni anfani lati sun.
But not in the way it means.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ni ọna ti o tumọ si.
It is too late to change.	O pẹ pupọ lati yi pada.
Or to pull out.	Tabi lati fa jade.
You get that.	O gba iyẹn.
He can't swim, so get on your boat!	Ko le we, nitorina wọ ọkọ oju omi rẹ!
Three boxes.	Awọn apoti mẹta.
Obviously, the opportunity has been won.	O han ni, anfani ti gba.
Families should lock their doors at night.	Awọn idile yẹ ki o ti ilẹkun wọn ni alẹ.
Have to take it to a local service center.	Ni lati mu lọ si ile-iṣẹ iṣẹ agbegbe.
I need to ask a question or two.	Mo nilo lati beere ibeere kan tabi meji.
A picture is true.	Aworan kan jẹ otitọ.
He woke me up from a sweet sleep.	O ji mi lati inu oorun ti o dun.
He could not keep me for a long time.	Ko ba ti le pa mi mọ fun igba pipẹ.
Yours is a lot more to my love.	Tirẹ jẹ pupọ diẹ sii si ifẹ mi.
If you want you can get rid of all this stuff.	Ti o ba fẹ o le lọ kuro ni gbogbo nkan yii.
That will require a lot of hard work.	Iyẹn yoo nilo iṣẹ lile pupọ.
That’s easy to understand.	Iyẹn rọrun lati ni oye.
He did not sleep for weeks.	Ko sun fun ọsẹ.
I wish we were in a better position.	Mo fẹ pe a wa ni ipo ti o dara julọ.
Tell my son, he said.	Sọ fun ọmọ mi, o sọ.
Most buildings have not been completed.	Pupọ julọ awọn ile ko ti pari pari.
He was not happy but agreed, saying he would come back.	Inu rẹ ko dun ṣugbọn o gba, o sọ pe oun yoo pada wa.
They told us we knew nothing.	Wọn sọ fun wa pe a ko mọ nkankan.
And there was something.	Ati nibẹ wà nkankan.
You have to wait, but it works.	O ni lati duro, ṣugbọn o ṣiṣẹ.
I think this is where everyone lives.	Mo ro pe eyi ni ibiti gbogbo eniyan n gbe.
I need to say.	Mo nilo lati sọ.
This is surprising to me.	Eyi jẹ iyalẹnu fun mi.
The words on her face are hard to read.	Awọn ọrọ ti o wa ni oju rẹ jẹ gidigidi lati ka.
Before your time is up.	Ṣaaju ki akoko rẹ to pari.
To run it only takes it.	Lati ṣiṣe ti o nikan gba a.
It is not well received.	O ti ko daradara gba.
I don't have time for you.	Emi ko ni akoko fun o.
Now there are also three books.	Bayi awọn iwe mẹta tun wa.
See how much you love your little girl.	Wo bi o ṣe fẹran ọmọbirin kekere rẹ.
Not, of course.	Ko ni, dajudaju.
When this happens.	Nigbati eyi ba ṣẹlẹ.
You must consider all aspects of the problem.	O gbọdọ ṣe akiyesi gbogbo awọn ẹgbẹ ti iṣoro naa.
They need to work.	Wọn nilo lati ṣiṣẹ.
He said it took time.	O sọ pe o gba akoko.
He is my son.	Ọmọ mi ni.
For everyone who has ever lived.	Fun gbogbo eniyan ti o ti gbe lailai.
Maybe, for a minute.	Boya, fun iṣẹju kan.
But power alone is not enough.	Ṣugbọn agbara nikan ko to.
I have the same.	Mo ni kanna.
Whatever this is.	Ohunkohun ti eyi jẹ.
However, it is not bad in thought.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe buburu ni ero.
Someone needs to do.	Ẹnikan nilo lati ṣe.
There are two main reasons for this.	Awọn idi pataki meji wa fun eyi.
I will have a good time.	Emi yoo ni akoko ti o dara.
It may not always be possible.	Ko le ṣee ṣe nigbagbogbo.
Because he wanted to see her.	Nitori o fe lati ri rẹ.
He got his hands up.	O ni ọwọ rẹ soke.
He said nothing.	Ko so nkankan.
That they get too much information, too many letters.	Pe wọn gba alaye pupọ ju, awọn lẹta pupọ.
It looks like it's working right now.	O dabi pe o n ṣiṣẹ ni bayi.
It is best if you use a new one.	O dara julọ ti o ba lo tuntun.
I think you are here because of it.	Mo ro pe o wa nibi nitori rẹ.
I remember that story.	Mo ranti itan yẹn.
Can anyone help me.	Le ẹnikẹni ran mi.
The lights are still on.	Awọn ina si tun han.
And for man, it was a mistake we made.	Ati fun eniyan, o jẹ aṣiṣe ti a ṣe.
But of course everyone knows he won’t live.	Ṣugbọn dajudaju gbogbo eniyan mọ pe kii yoo gbe.
And we changed and.	Ati pe a yipada ati.
We have more to add to this.	A ni diẹ lati fi kun si eyi.
Travel costs a lot of money these days.	Irin-ajo n gba owo pupọ ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
The same can be seen below.	Kanna o ti le ri ni isalẹ.
Some people walk.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan rin.
Believe in us.	Gbagbọ nipa wa.
This is the kind of thing you want us to come up with.	Eyi ni iru ohun ti o fẹ wa si aaye fun.
I do not know when.	Nko mo igba.
I think he was there.	Mo ro pe o wa nibẹ.
The thing is to think of someone’s work.	Nkan naa ni lati ronu iṣẹ ẹnikan.
They are also a whole lot of work.	Wọn ti wa ni tun kan gbogbo pupo ti ise.
He has never come back.	Ko ti pada wa ri.
Maybe he hates me about it now.	Boya o korira mi nipa bayi.
Of course ,.	Dajudaju,.
You never know that.	O ko ti mọ iyẹn.
I may lose my job.	Mo le padanu iṣẹ mi.
I just love your songs.	Mo kan nifẹ awọn orin rẹ.
It does not seem to have been used at all.	Ko dabi ẹni pe o ti lo paapaa.
I know you now.	Mo ti mọ ọ bayi.
Not the same as the others.	Ko kanna bi awọn miiran.
I used it for a while without it making it better.	Mo lo fun igba diẹ laisi o jẹ ki o dara julọ.
No one knew that the baby was in the room.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ pe ọmọ naa wa ninu yara naa.

We cannot let them die.	A ko le jẹ ki wọn ku.
And stay there, or higher.	Ki o si duro nibẹ, tabi ti o ga.
They have a group there every week.	Wọn ni ẹgbẹ kan nibẹ ni gbogbo ọsẹ.

He told them he was nearby.	O sọ fun wọn pe o wa nitosi.
But don’t dwell on that.	Ṣugbọn maṣe duro lori iyẹn.

It was a very bad time for me.	O jẹ akoko buburu pupọ fun mi.
Put your hands behind your back.	Fi ọwọ rẹ lẹhin rẹ.

You may have been scared.	O le ti jẹ ki o bẹru.

I could not find such a gift in it.	Emi ko le rii iru ẹbun bẹẹ ninu rẹ.
A world we all really want to live in.	Aye kan ti gbogbo wa fẹ lati gbe ni gaan.
Nothing happened to the man.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si ọkunrin naa.
Not good.	Ko dara.
Take off your shoes when you go inside.	Yọ bata rẹ nigbati o ba wọ inu.
Nothing left.	Ko si ohun to ku.
I started to take pictures.	Mo bẹrẹ lati ya awọn aworan.
I don't think so at all.	Emi ko ronu iyẹn rara.
We change all the time.	A yipada ni gbogbo igba.
They have filled their hands.	Wọn ti kun ọwọ wọn.
He went about them.	O si lọ nipa wọn.
Some areas have reached the river.	Diẹ ninu awọn agbegbe ti de odo.
This will change the game.	Eyi yoo yipada ere naa.
Get my hands on it.	Gba ọwọ mi.
We have nothing to fear.	A ko ni nkankan lati bẹru.
But make sure you know what you are doing and why.	Ṣugbọn rii daju pe o mọ ohun ti o n ṣe ati idi ti.
Everything now seems to be in existence.	Ohun gbogbo ni bayi dabi pe o wa ni aye.
I look forward to working with you again.	Mo n reti lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ lẹẹkansi.
You don’t want to talk about it.	O ko fẹ lati sọrọ nipa rẹ.
I'm very happy.	Inu mi dun pupo.
Just more so.	O kan diẹ sii bẹ.
Both men looked up.	Awọn ọkunrin mejeeji wo soke.
For a long time nothing happened.	Fun igba pipẹ ko si nkan ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It has to be simple enough for any person off the street.	O ni lati rọrun to fun eyikeyi eniyan kuro ni ita.
Do not turn your back.	Maṣe yi ẹhin rẹ pada.
He slept only for a few hours last night.	O sun nikan fun wakati diẹ ni alẹ ana.
There are not many here in the old area.	Ko si ọpọlọpọ nibi ni agbegbe atijọ.
She now lives with her mother, taking care of her.	O n gbe ni bayi pẹlu iya rẹ, o tọju rẹ.
Your first date.	Rẹ akọkọ ọjọ.
But it was also a day we will never forget.	Ṣugbọn o tun jẹ ọjọ ti a kii yoo gbagbe.
They did not drink.	Wọn ko mu.
Unable to understand.	Ti ko le loye.
They say they made a mistake.	Wọn sọ pe wọn ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
All my plans are dead.	Gbogbo eto mi ti ku.
It will take a few minutes to fill.	Yoo gba to iṣẹju diẹ lati kun.
I knew he would come.	Mo mọ pe oun yoo wa.
I really like them.	Mo nifẹ pupọ ninu wọn.
But it’s about so much more than that.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ nipa pupọ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
That was a while ago.	Iyẹn jẹ igba diẹ sẹhin.
Send him a letter.	Fi lẹta ranṣẹ si i.
We should fear that we may become you.	A yẹ ki o bẹru pe a le di ọ.
I just thought.	Mo kan ro.
Or learn completely.	Tabi kọ ẹkọ patapata.
He will have to give them a reason.	Oun yoo ni lati fun wọn ni idi kan.
I see now.	Mo ti ri bayi.
He was at the meeting.	O wa ni ipade naa.
We just can't help it.	A o kan ko le ran o.
However, some women benefit from this high energy.	Sibẹsibẹ, diẹ ninu awọn obinrin ni anfani lati agbara giga yii.
They just want us to be heard.	Wọn kan fẹ ki a gbọ wọn.
It was just so much money.	O je kan ki Elo owo.
But enough from me.	Sugbon to lati mi.
Don't tell him.	Maṣe sọ fun u.
I do not want to read what they say about us.	Emi ko fẹ lati ka ohun ti won so nipa wa.
They will see it all the time.	Wọn yoo rii i ni gbogbo igba.
And really lost now.	Ati ki o padanu gan ni bayi.
He lives with his wife in a small house.	O n gbe pẹlu iyawo rẹ ni ile kekere kan.
We will work something out.	A yoo ṣiṣẹ nkankan jade.
I do not see it.	Nko ri e.
I also hate it.	Mo tun korira rẹ.
In other words, the rules have not changed.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, awọn ofin ko yipada.
This is not an accident.	Eyi kii ṣe ijamba.
He took it.	O mu u.
Her body is not well.	Ara rẹ ko dara.
The injury is in.	Ipalara naa wa ninu.
I found it here.	Mo ti ri i nibi.
Of course you are right.	Dajudaju o tọ.
I’m coming whether you like it or not.	Mo n bọ boya o fẹran rẹ tabi rara.
Some students start to sit together.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọ ile-iwe bẹrẹ lati joko papọ.
Now time does not seem right.	Bayi akoko ko dabi pe o tọ.
One cannot change the world.	Eniyan kan ko le yi aye pada.
This is found in metal.	Eyi ti a ri ni irin.
This is not very likely to happen.	Eyi ko ṣeeṣe pupọ lati ṣẹlẹ.
The reasons for this rule are twofold.	Idi fun ofin yii jẹ meji.
You can not see them.	O ko le ri wọn.
You can really.	O le ṣe gaan.
I said no.	Mo sọ pe ko si mọ.
I don’t write games.	Emi ko kọ awọn ere.
Trees located in an elevated and elevated area.	Awọn igi ti o wa ni agbegbe ti o ga ati giga.
Those games usually hit or lose.	Awọn ere yẹn maa n lu tabi padanu.
This even helps big houses.	Eyi paapaa ṣe iranlọwọ fun awọn ile nla.
Pay the bills on time.	San awọn owo ni akoko.
I will not repeat that here.	Emi kii yoo tun iyẹn ṣe nibi.
Not much seems to have changed.	Ko Elo dabi enipe a ti yi pada.
Get the money.	Gba owo naa.
Nice to see you again.	O dara lati ri ọ lẹẹkansi.
What they paid him.	Ohun ti wọn san fun u.
Lots and lots of girls.	Pupọ ati ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọbirin.
Now let me take you through all the details.	Bayi jẹ ki n mu ọ nipasẹ gbogbo awọn alaye.
You are my future.	Iwọ ni ojo iwaju mi.
You usually have other ideas.	O maa n ni awọn ero miiran.
He threw something into a bag and left.	O ju nkan sinu apo kan o si lọ kuro.
Try not to worry.	Gbiyanju lati ma ṣe aniyan.
The children brought lunch and ate at school.	Awọn ọmọde mu ounjẹ ọsan wa ati jẹun ni ile-iwe.
He rejected me.	O kọ mi silẹ.
He does not speak.	Ko sọrọ.
The girls want to be with her.	Awọn ọmọbirin fẹ lati wa pẹlu rẹ.
I have never liked it.	Emi ko ba ti feran rẹ.
It's my song.	Orin mi ni.
I gave him a job, revealed.	Mo fun u ni iṣẹ kan, fi han.
However, the technique does not seem to work.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọgbọn naa ko dabi pe o ṣiṣẹ.
I hope he is not too angry again.	Mo nireti pe ko tun binu pupọ.
Not as other people think.	Kii ṣe bi awọn eniyan miiran ṣe ronu rẹ.
What a trip !.	Kini irin-ajo!.
We see when we let ourselves stand.	A rii nigba ti a jẹ ki ara wa duro.
It's hot now.	O gbona ni bayi.
But about their very existence.	Sugbon nipa won gan aye.
You can't stay here.	O ko le duro nibi.
He was arrested after his mother called the police.	Wọn mu u lẹhin ti iya rẹ pe ọlọpa.
I like that a lot.	Mo feran pe pupo.
You don’t have to go all the time.	O ko ni lati lọ si gbogbo awọn akoko.
But he let the house back on track.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ki ile naa pada si ọna.
You may have tried something at one time or another.	O le ti gbiyanju nkankan ni akoko kan.
I look inside them.	Mo wo inu wọn.
My baby needs to sleep.	Ọmọ mi nilo lati sun.

Let me know what you decided.	Jẹ ki mi mọ ohun ti o pinnu.
Now this is small.	Bayi eyi jẹ kekere.
Believe me, .	Gba mi gbọ, .

Most people don’t.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ko ṣe.
That was interesting.	Ti o je awon.
Word is around.	Ọrọ ti wa ni ayika.
You have the opportunity.	O ni anfani naa.
It seemed good.	O dabi enipe o dara.

To do it just because.	Lati ṣe o kan nitori.
To a man.	Si ọkunrin kan.
I can see in your work.	Mo le rii ninu iṣẹ rẹ.
Read it out.	Ka o jade.

We will be fine.	A yoo dara.
No accident.	Ko si ijamba.
Some have had a car accident.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti ṣe ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
The boy was a boy, and he was all good.	Ọmọkunrin naa jẹ ọmọkunrin, ati pe gbogbo rẹ dara.
It does not appear that you have noticed it.	O ko han pe o ti ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
I am for it.	Mo wa nitori rẹ.
Maybe you made a mistake.	Boya o ti ṣe aṣiṣe.
No one can tell you what kind of work they are but they are.	Ko si ẹniti o le sọ fun ọ iru iṣẹ ti o jẹ ṣugbọn wọn jẹ.
I took the whole trip.	Mo gba gbogbo irin-ajo naa.
It really got on with it.	O gan ni lori pẹlu rẹ.
He did not ask if he was alone.	Ko beere boya o wa nikan.
Have to find problems.	Ni lati wa awọn iṣoro.
This road is here.	Opopona yii wa nibi.
I do so sometimes.	Mo ṣe bẹ nigba miiran.
You have written the law.	O ti kọ ofin.
I have killed people.	Mo ti pa eniyan.
You can sell one thing and buy another.	O le ta nkan kan ki o ra miiran.
And now, that is my opinion.	Ati ni bayi, iyẹn ni ero mi.
But of course he would not do that.	Ṣugbọn dajudaju oun ko ni ṣe iyẹn.
Very good.	O dara gaan.
The water of the rain came from the river.	Omi ti awọn ojo ti wa lati odo.
A person like him.	Eniyan ti o dabi rẹ.
Some of them do not know who he is.	Diẹ ninu wọn ko mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
However, most people want to get what they need first.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọpọlọpọ eniyan fẹ lati gba ohun ti wọn nilo akọkọ.
This is, of course, not true.	Eyi jẹ, dajudaju kii ṣe otitọ.
We will all miss that this summer.	Gbogbo wa yoo padanu iyẹn ni igba ooru yii.
We missed the big picture.	A padanu aworan nla naa.
Not the same as below.	Ko kanna bi ni isalẹ.
Do not do this again.	Maṣe ṣe eyi lẹẹkansi.
I'll lower my gaze and go.	Emi yoo rẹ oju mi ​​silẹ ki o si lọ.
The man you have seen a few days ago.	Ọkunrin ti o ti ri ni awọn ọjọ diẹ sẹhin.
I told him to raise the money.	Mo sọ fun u pe ki o gbe owo naa soke.
I hope you have a good sleep !.	Mo nireti pe o ni oorun ti o dara!.
This tea is sweet.	Tii yii dun.
I have learned a lot about how to communicate well with people.	Mo ti kọ ẹkọ pupọ nipa bi o ṣe le ba awọn eniyan sọrọ daradara.
He says women are more beautiful than ever.	O sọ pe awọn obinrin lẹwa diẹ sii ju lailai.
All you can do is say or do something nice.	Gbogbo ohun ti o le ṣe ni lati sọ tabi ṣe nkan ti o dara.
Hot water and clear here.	Omi gbona ati ki o ko o nibi.
Man was born.	A bi eniyan.

I think of my wife and children.	Mo ro ti iyawo mi ati awọn ọmọ.
You will need to grow your hair out.	O yoo nilo lati dagba irun rẹ jade.
The men had difficulty making eye contact.	Awọn ọkunrin naa ni iṣoro ṣiṣe oju oju.
You have no more.	O ko ni diẹ sii.
They will pay you big money.	Wọn yoo san owo nla fun ọ.
It was not great, but it was just what we would need.	O je ko nla, sugbon o je kan ohun ti a yoo nilo.
Lots and lots of trips.	Pupọ ati ọpọlọpọ awọn irin-ajo.
You have said so.	O ti sọ bẹ.

Your site carries them all.	Aaye rẹ gbe gbogbo wọn.
Do sit down.	Ṣe joko.
But that is not true.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
There is not enough of that.	Nibẹ ni ko to ti awọn.
This is a difficult task.	Eyi jẹ iṣẹ ṣiṣe ti o nira.
He put it in his books.	O fi sinu awọn iwe rẹ.
They are on us.	Wọn wa lori wa.
He looked at his watch again.	O tun wo aago rẹ lẹẹkansi.
It seemed like a great idea at the time.	O dabi enipe imọran nla ni akoko naa.
In most cases everything works as expected.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba ohun gbogbo ṣiṣẹ bi o ti ṣe yẹ.
But it also has its own.	Ṣugbọn o tun ni tirẹ.
Everyone turned to him.	Gbogbo eniyan yipada si ọdọ rẹ.
But it will require hard work.	Ṣugbọn yoo nilo iṣẹ lile.
That was the first time they came to me.	Bi wọn ṣe de ọdọ mi niyẹn ni akọkọ.
But nothing came of it.	Sugbon ko si ohun to de ọdọ rẹ.
They change in many areas.	Wọn yipada ni ọpọlọpọ awọn agbegbe.
We can't wait now.	A ko le duro ni bayi.
No hard time.	Ko si akoko lile.
Or to draw.	Tabi lati fa.

Very good.	O dara pupọ.
It has nothing to do with it.	Ko ni nkankan lati se pẹlu ti o.
I love your back for music.	Mo nifẹ ẹhin rẹ fun orin.
Should we drink tea?	Ṣe o yẹ ki a mu tii?
But this time, it will not be very easy.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yii, kii yoo rọrun pupọ.
They all stopped.	Gbogbo won duro.
But right now, what he is doing is very good.	Ṣugbọn ni bayi, ohun ti o n ṣe dara pupọ.
There are two ways to move.	Awọn ọna meji lo wa lati gbe.
You would not want to be there.	Iwọ kii yoo fẹ lati wa nibẹ.
It changed my life.	O yi igbesi aye mi pada.
He was the last child of his family.	O jẹ ọmọ ikẹhin ti idile rẹ.
Or we can stay out of it.	Tabi a le duro kuro ninu rẹ.
They are given by.	Wọn ti wa ni fun nipasẹ.
They used a side car.	Wọn lo ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ẹgbẹ.
Three jobs in three months.	Awọn iṣẹ mẹta ni oṣu mẹta.
The man will kill his mother.	Ọkunrin naa yoo pa iya rẹ.
There is no such thing.	Ko si ohun ti iru.
You should be home by now.	O yẹ ki o wa ni ile nipasẹ bayi.
People rush up to ask what is wrong.	Awon eniyan sare soke lati beere ohun ti ko tọ.
He was thinking.	O n ronu.
Let me know when you can see me.	Jẹ ki mi mọ nigbati o le ri mi.
But that’s where the music came from.	Sugbon ibi ti orin naa ti wa.
I believe you are right.	Mo gbagbọ pe o tọ.
You look up incredibly.	O wo soke iyalẹnu.
We start with a simple but important note.	A bẹrẹ pẹlu rọrun ṣugbọn akiyesi pataki.
Gives nothing fun and the highest value.	Yoo fun ohunkohun fun ati iye ga julọ.
We are not looking for this.	A ko wa eyi.

It is easy to get the attention of children.	O rọrun lati gba akiyesi awọn ọmọde.
My eyes are happy.	Oju mi ​​dun.
Use to ask.	Lo lati beere.
The planes took off.	Awọn ọkọ ofurufu ga soke.

How many dogs were left in the car?	Awọn aja melo ni wọn fi silẹ ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa?
You should get up in the morning.	O yẹ ki o dide ni owurọ.
And get everything you can carry.	Ati ki o gba ohun gbogbo ti o le gbe.
But that's right, you know.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn tọ, o mọ.

We just want to get more points than them.	A kan fẹ lati gba awọn aaye diẹ sii ju wọn lọ.
And try it.	Ati ki o gbiyanju o ṣe.
In this way they fast.	Ni ọna yii wọn yara yara.
Apparatus.	Ohun elo.
The child has no rest.	Ọmọ naa ko ni isinmi.
Something is happening.	Nkankan n ṣẹlẹ.
The streets are full of people.	Awọn opopona ti kun fun eniyan.
And it was good.	Ati pe o dara.
You didn't see my brother.	O ko ri arakunrin mi.
But first he asked how he was doing.	Ṣugbọn akọkọ o beere bi o ṣe n ṣe.
In their hands, they took the future of the team.	Ni ọwọ wọn, wọn mu ojo iwaju ẹgbẹ naa.
But they are just history.	Ṣugbọn wọn jẹ itan nikan.
You have lost interest in your career.	O ti padanu anfani ni iṣẹ rẹ.
Her brother is pulling her leg.	Arakunrin rẹ n fa ẹsẹ rẹ.
You are not here.	O ko wa nibi.
Some people think that love is about things.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ro pe ifẹ jẹ nipa awọn nkan.
That must end.	Iyẹn gbọdọ pari.
They have seen what you do, you and others.	Wọn ti rii ohun ti o ṣe, iwọ ati awọn miiran.
It helped me a lot.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi pupọ.
Which is always the case.	Eyi ti o jẹ nigbagbogbo.
You know what we mean.	O mọ ohun ti a tumọ si.
You have to work in the morning.	O ni lati ṣiṣẹ ni owurọ.
But it is not true.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe otitọ.
You have to forget everything you have written outside.	O ni lati gbagbe ohun gbogbo ti o ti kọ ni ita.
Lots of money spent for many bad groups.	Ọpọlọpọ owo ti a lo fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹgbẹ buburu.
One is and the other is.	Ọkan jẹ ati awọn miiran ni.
Lots of people will be there.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan yoo wa nibẹ.
But you can learn to call it love.	Ṣugbọn o le kọ ẹkọ lati pe rẹ ni ifẹ.
I taught it in school.	Mo kọ ọ ni ile-iwe.
So it becomes like this below.	Nitorina o di bi eyi ni isalẹ.
Power if we have one.	Agbara ti a ba ti ni ọkan.
A boy was born.	A bi ọmọkunrin kan.
Not in those words.	Kii ṣe ninu awọn ọrọ yẹn.
It has been since then.	O ti wa lati igba naa.
Of course you know.	Dajudaju o mọ.
This is very important.	Eyi ṣe pataki pupọ.
I'm fine.	Mo wa daradara.
New songs are out today.	Awọn orin tuntun ti jade loni.
It depends on what they are.	O da lori ohun ti wọn jẹ.
It’s not worth your time or energy.	O ko tọ akoko tabi agbara rẹ.
She was afraid she might cut herself.	O bẹru pe o le ge ara rẹ.
We ended up here.	A ti pari soke nibi.
And my own football.	Ati bọọlu ti ara mi.
I used my feet to push them away.	Mo lo ẹsẹ mi lati ta wọn kuro.
Her eyes are beautiful.	Oju rẹ lẹwa.
Nothing out here.	Ko si nkankan jade nibi.
It is beyond that.	O ti kọja iyẹn.
They are not a car.	Wọn kii ṣe ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
They are not yours.	Wọn kii ṣe tirẹ.
Now that will never happen.	Bayi iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ rara.
There are no rules in the books.	Ko si awọn ofin ninu awọn iwe.
They continue to say so.	Wọn tẹsiwaju lati sọ bẹ.
It was pretty much what he did.	O je lẹwa Elo ohun ti o ṣe.
Why are you always angry?	Kini idi ti o fi n binu nigbagbogbo?
Water is water that extinguishes fire.	Omi jẹ omi ti o pa ina.
I do not like it at all.	Nko feran re rara.
They explain it as you expect.	Wọn ṣe alaye rẹ bi o ṣe reti.
I don’t want this to ever happen.	Emi ko fẹ ki eyi ṣẹlẹ lailai.
How big or difficult or long it doesn’t matter.	Bawo ni nla tabi nira tabi gun ko ṣe pataki.
That caught people's attention.	Iyẹn gba akiyesi eniyan.
I love that word.	Mo nifẹ ọrọ yẹn.
You know why you hesitate.	O mọ idi ti o fi ṣiyemeji.
He has never seen me.	Ko tii ri mi.
There is a contract from that day.	Iwe adehun wa lati ọjọ yẹn.
My eyes have done well.	Oju mi ​​ti ṣe daradara.
Now that’s not a lot of drinking.	Bayi iyẹn kii ṣe mimu pupọ.
It is necessary.	O ṣe pataki.
I need another way.	Mo nilo ọna miiran.
The lights went back on.	Awọn ina lọ pada lori.
There is more inside.	Nibẹ ni diẹ sii inu.
And maybe what it is.	Ati boya ohun ti o jẹ.
I saw your face.	Mo ti ri oju rẹ.
You will know that it is right for me when you meet him.	Iwọ yoo mọ pe o tọ fun mi nigbati o ba pade rẹ.
She likes men in uniform.	O fẹran awọn ọkunrin ni aṣọ ile.
They have every opportunity.	Won ni gbogbo anfani.
The word came out.	Ọrọ naa jade.
That sounds interesting.	Ti o dun awon.
He was afraid of that, so he told me everything.	O bẹru naa, nitorina o sọ ohun gbogbo fun mi.
That's how you want to insert it.	Bi o ṣe fẹ fi sii niyẹn.
Now he is dead.	Bayi o ti ku.
I have heard it all.	Mo ti gbọ gbogbo awọn ti o.
He waited a few minutes for the train.	O duro fun iṣẹju diẹ fun ọkọ oju irin naa.
You will not let it go.	Iwọ kii yoo jẹ ki o lọ.
There are many places.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn aaye wa.
They have no idea what they are saying.	Wọn ko ni imọran eyikeyi nipa ohun ti wọn sọ.
He knew he had to stop before it was too late.	O mọ pe o ni lati da oun duro ṣaaju ki o to pẹ.
We climbed a huge mountain.	A gun oke nla kan.
That was the first big break for me.	Iyẹn jẹ isinmi nla akọkọ fun mi.
I am after a job.	Mo wa lẹhin iṣẹ kan.
Even through us.	Paapaa nipasẹ wa.
These men are afraid of him.	Awọn ọkunrin wọnyi bẹru rẹ.
How to handle it.	Bawo ni lati mu u.
He looked at the standing area.	O wo agbegbe ti o duro.
You do not know what it is you know.	Ti o ko mọ ohun ti o jẹ ti o mọ.
It took about two days to drive there.	O gba to bii ọjọ meji lati wakọ nibẹ.
If it rains, it will not go away.	Ti o ba ti ojo, o yoo ko lọ.
Do that.	Ṣe iyẹn.
Ask questions in class.	Beere ibeere ni kilasi.
Of course we do not.	Dajudaju a ko ṣe.
She did not know what to say to him.	O ko mọ ohun ti yoo sọ fun u.
He just never saw me.	O kan ko ri mi rara.
You were wrong at the time.	Iwọ ko tọ ni ori ni akoko yẹn.
I think I was a little afraid of love in the past.	Mo ro pe mo ti bẹru diẹ ti ifẹ ni igba atijọ.
We drank tea.	A mu tii.
Nothing we want.	Ko si ohun ti a fe.
Something you treat with wisdom.	Nkankan ti o tọju pẹlu ọgbọn.
He stood up.	O duro soke.
I just love your work so much.	Mo kan nifẹ si iṣẹ rẹ pupọ.
That if you change your ways you will see it.	Pe ti o ba yi ọna rẹ yoo ri i.
I want to help you improve.	Mo fẹ ran ọ lọwọ lati dara si.
Of course, a lot of people were left behind.	Dajudaju, ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan ni a fi silẹ.
So, in the end, they left.	Nitorina, ni ipari, wọn fi silẹ.
They also charge much more than their value.	Wọn tun gba agbara pupọ diẹ sii ju iye wọn lọ.
Maybe there is something to that.	Boya ohun kan wa si iyẹn.
Do not talk at all.	Maṣe sọrọ rara.
But they can not.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko le.
I have to charge.	Mo ni lati gba agbara.
Didn't find it.	Ko ri i.
You are not allowed to eat in this room.	O ko gba ọ laaye lati jẹun ni yara yii.
I have factual information.	Mo ni alaye to daju.
He could not do more.	Ko le ṣe diẹ sii.
I don’t want to be evil.	Emi ko fẹ lati jẹ ibi.
I have never seen anything like it in my whole life.	Emi ko tii ri iru rẹ ri ni gbogbo igbesi aye mi.
So that is the reason.	Nitorina idi niyen.
The metal is very hard.	Awọn irin jẹ gidigidi lile.
He left the ear and sat down.	O lọ kuro ni eti o si joko.
People love a good story.	Eniyan ni ife kan ti o dara itan.
Great job or bad job ?.	Ise nla tabi ise buburu?.
Money can only get you so much.	Owo le nikan gba o ki Elo.
Very good for the first time.	O dara pupọ fun igba akọkọ.
He does not want to have to think about things like this anymore.	Ko fẹ lati ni lati ronu nipa awọn nkan bii eyi mọ.
It's great.	O jẹ nla.
They write down their observations.	Wọn kọ awọn akiyesi wọn silẹ.
Run around, stay alive, get the money.	Ṣiṣe ni ayika, duro laaye, gba owo naa.
That is an interesting question.	Iyẹn jẹ ibeere ti o nifẹ.
Everyone needs money these days.	Gbogbo eniyan nilo owo ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
It was really really hard.	O je gan gan lile.
It could be months.	O le jẹ awọn oṣu.
Little things you know you can't do.	Awọn nkan kekere ti o mọ pe ko le ṣe.
I am very.	Mo jẹ pupọ.
The mother is watching.	Iya n wo.
We were both still alone.	A wà mejeeji si tun nikan.
Therefore, a book has been written on this.	Nitorina, a ti kọ iwe kan lori eyi.
And this is important.	Ati pe eyi ṣe pataki.
Do you like music?	Ṣe o nifẹ orin bi?
This can be a bad thing.	Eyi le jẹ ohun buburu.
He did not stand for himself at all.	Ko duro fun ara rẹ rara.
This city used to have a port.	Ilu yi lo lati ni ibudo.
I do not like the way the decision came.	Emi ko fẹran ọna ti ipinnu naa ti de.
He said nothing about it, to me.	Ko sọ nkankan nipa rẹ, fun mi.
Love is only love when it works.	Ifẹ jẹ ifẹ nikan nigbati o ba ṣiṣẹ.
I want you.	Mo fẹ ọ.
We are in the world and of it.	A wa ninu aye ati ti rẹ.
He was forced to stay indoors.	O fi agbara mu lati duro ninu ile.
You want to remember everything about this moment.	O fẹ lati ranti ohun gbogbo nipa akoko yii.
I do not really.	Emi ko gan.
Find the site you want to change.	Wa aaye ti o fẹ yipada.
The program is simple.	Eto naa rọrun.
It just let me know how fast the room time is going.	O kan jẹ ki n mọ bi akoko yara ti n lọ.
I do more than that.	Mo ṣe diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
I am sure he will change.	Mo ni idaniloju pe oun yoo yipada.
I like school.	Mo feran ile-iwe.
Soon he lost, however, never returned.	Laipẹ o padanu, sibẹsibẹ, ko pada.
I thought about that.	Mo ti ro nipa eyi.
Of course they are better than they were a week ago.	Dajudaju wọn dara ju ti wọn ti jẹ ọsẹ kan sẹhin.
You look down to the street below.	O wo isalẹ si ita ni isalẹ.
Don't stand around for me.	Maṣe duro ni ayika fun mi.
A new world.	Aye tuntun kan.
The meeting did not go as planned.	Ipade naa ko lọ ohunkohun bi o ti pinnu.
Money is in their hands.	Owo wa ni owo won.
This is the method shown below.	Eyi ni ọna ti o han ni isalẹ.
I am not there yet.	Emi ko tii wa nibẹ.
Let me repeat that.	Jẹ ki n tun pe.
You must have stolen that money.	O gbọdọ ti ji owo yẹn.
I'm glad to see you.	Inu mi dun lati ri e.
I try to remember the words you want to use.	Mo gbiyanju lati ranti awọn ọrọ ti o fẹ lo.
I do not have to buy shoes.	Emi ko ni lati ra awọn bata.
Maybe you already have one.	Boya o ti ni ọkan tẹlẹ.
That is why we are here tonight.	Eyi ni idi ti a fi wa nibi ni alẹ oni.
He will need to go to you.	Oun yoo nilo lati lọ si ọdọ rẹ.
You should continue to read as much as possible.	O yẹ ki o tẹsiwaju lati ka bi o ti ṣee ṣe.
He also knew that everything could be difficult without a friend.	O tun mọ pe ohun gbogbo le nira laisi ọrẹ kan.
But do not let that stop you.	Ṣugbọn maṣe jẹ ki iyẹn da ọ duro.
He jumped out of the cars.	O fo jade ninu awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
That was two days ago.	Iyẹn jẹ ọjọ meji diẹ sẹhin.
This is now used as a tree.	Eyi ti lo bayi bi igi.
I will not see or know you any more.	Emi kii yoo rii tabi mọ ọ diẹ sii.
This takes over.	Eyi n gba kọja rẹ.
The street is great.	Ita ti nla.
We should ask this.	A yẹ ki o beere eyi.
How soon they forgot.	Bawo ni kete ti wọn gbagbe.
But it takes a lot of time to do.	Ṣugbọn o gba akoko pupọ lati ṣe.
He decided to let it pass.	O pinnu lati jẹ ki o kọja.
They will have to tell.	Wọn yoo ni lati sọ fun.
Good here for you, me and the food.	O dara nibi fun ọ, emi ati ounjẹ.
It will come to me.	Yoo wa si mi.
That's how it got me.	Bi o ṣe gba mi niyẹn.
It could happen again.	O le ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
But the cost is also always very high.	Ṣugbọn iye owo naa tun ga pupọ nigbagbogbo.
You must have known that.	O gbọdọ ti mọ pe.
I understand why they would feel this way.	Mo loye idi ti wọn yoo lero ni ọna yii.
However, there are more reasons for that than just that.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn idi diẹ sii fun iyẹn ju eyi nikan lọ.
There is not much in the garden.	Ko si pupọ ninu ọgba naa.
So he continued.	Nitorina o tẹsiwaju.
First we have to wait.	Ni akọkọ a ni lati duro.
Just tea now.	O kan tii ni bayi.
Just look at her face.	Iyanu kan wo oju rẹ.
He will never love her.	Oun ko ni nifẹ rẹ lailai.
There is no way to do it.	Ko si ọna ti o ṣe.
All drinking water is made.	Gbogbo omi mimu ni a ṣe.
This program works.	Eto yi ṣiṣẹ.
More than you want.	Diẹ sii ju ti o fẹ.
I want.	Mo fe.
Everyone is.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o.
Only people are allowed to enter the city at night.	Awọn eniyan kan nikan ni a gba laaye lati wọ ilu naa ni alẹ.
This agrees with me.	Eleyi gba si mi.
The situation here is similar to that described.	Ipo ti o wa nibi dabi eyi ti a sọ.
I am looking for advice.	Mo n wa imọran.
The trip took three months.	Irin-ajo naa gba oṣu mẹta.
I'm not sure it will happen.	Emi ko ni idaniloju pe yoo ṣẹlẹ.
The children are.	Awọn ọmọde ni.
We wish it had not happened.	A fẹ pe ko ṣẹlẹ.
The children in this city are full of energy.	Awọn ọmọde ni ilu yii kun fun agbara.
To love one another.	Lati nifẹ ara wọn.
You need to stop.	O nilo lati da.
You will have to do everything.	Iwọ yoo ni lati ṣe ohun gbogbo.
The water is not fast.	Omi ko yara.
It depends on the situation.	O da lori ipo.
Summer is one.	Ooru jẹ ọkan.
We have no way of knowing about your situation.	A ko ni ọna lati mọ nipa ipo rẹ.
Three days passed.	Ọjọ mẹta kọja.
Sounds like you ?.	O dun bi iwọ?.
They have tried hard.	Wọn ti gbiyanju lile.
You get in the way of their services.	O gba ni ọna awọn iṣẹ iṣẹ wọn.
He’s doing a great job.	O n ṣe iṣẹ nla kan.
You can not test that.	O ko le ṣe idanwo yẹn.
The main words of the piece.	Awọn ọrọ akọkọ ti nkan naa.
I am home.	Mo wa ile.
But you will get it.	Ṣugbọn iwọ yoo gba.
And you see some new fixed problems.	Ati pe o rii diẹ ninu awọn iṣoro tuntun ti o wa titi.
Some of them back.	Diẹ ninu wọn pada.
That's your business.	Iṣẹ rẹ niyẹn.
He will know what it means.	Oun yoo mọ ohun ti o tumọ si.
Drink some hot tea.	Mu tii gbona diẹ.
There is something they found, however.	Ohun kan wa ti wọn rii, sibẹsibẹ.
You need at least one last name.	O nilo awọn orukọ ti o kẹhin ni o kere ju.
She hurried back, into her room.	O yara pada wa, sinu yara rẹ.
But they have a serious problem right now.	Ṣugbọn wọn ni iṣoro pataki kan bayi.
This is not something to laugh about.	Eyi kii ṣe nkankan lati rẹrin nipa.
I'll take it everywhere with me.	Emi yoo mu nibi gbogbo pẹlu mi.
But this is the last life.	Ṣugbọn eyi ni aye ti o kẹhin.
I ask you not to do that seriously.	Mo beere pe ki o ma ṣe iyẹn pataki.
Everyone talks about this.	Gbogbo eniyan sọrọ nipa eyi.
Making sense is almost hard.	Ṣiṣe oye ti o fẹrẹ jẹ lile.
They are happy to attend the services.	Inu wọn dun lati lọ si awọn iṣẹ naa.
Agreement is a legal agreement.	Adehun jẹ adehun ti ofin.
I'll have some money for you.	Emi yoo ni owo diẹ fun ọ.
You may be interested in me and you too maybe.	O le nifẹ si emi ati iwọ paapaa boya.
So tired.	O ti re.
He decided to buy.	O pinnu lati ra.
The law, however, requires more.	Ofin, sibẹsibẹ, nilo diẹ sii.
I can read for the coming weeks.	Mo le ka fun awọn ọsẹ to nbọ.
Read it, and tell me what you think.	Ka o, ki o si so fun mi ohun ti o ro.
And so I did.	Ati bẹ Mo ṣe.
I arrived there at sunrise.	Mo de nibẹ ni oorun dide.
He looked at me.	O wo mi.
It will be that.	Yoo jẹ pe.
It has two modes.	O ni awọn ipo meji.
Just look at the men in this room alone.	O kan wo awọn ọkunrin ninu yara yi nikan.
But he does not know everything.	Ṣugbọn ko mọ ohun gbogbo.
The man killed himself.	Ọkunrin naa pa ara rẹ.
The kind of music someone likes.	Iru orin ti ẹnikan fẹran.
Do not say that at all.	Maṣe sọ iyẹn rara.
I miss you so much.	Mo padanu re pupo.
Let things happen on their own time.	Jẹ ki ohun ṣẹlẹ lori ara wọn akoko.
Maybe you have.	Boya o ni.
And, it looks like they did that again.	Ati pe, o dabi pe wọn tun ṣe iyẹn lẹẹkansi.
you have.	o ni.
It let me see them for the first time.	O jẹ ki n rii wọn fun igba akọkọ.
It is, and yet is not.	O jẹ, ati sibẹsibẹ kii ṣe.
But it's a big picture, it's coming.	Ṣugbọn aworan nla ni, o n bọ.
So very simple.	Nitorina o rọrun pupọ.
I will not be harmed.	Emi kii yoo ni ipalara.
This will not be a surprise to anyone who knows it.	Eyi kii yoo ṣe ohun iyanu fun ẹnikẹni ti o mọ ọ.
It is on its own.	O wa lori ara rẹ.
They have no rest if they do not give them something to do.	Wọn ko ni isinmi ti wọn ko ba fun wọn ni nkankan lati ṣe.
It was so nice to see you back on your feet.	O dara pupọ lati ri ọ pada lori ẹsẹ rẹ.
Breakfast was my favorite meal of the day.	Ounjẹ owurọ jẹ ounjẹ ayanfẹ mi ti ọjọ naa.
However, they did their job.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn ṣe iṣẹ wọn.
It 's too late for that now.	O pẹ fun iyẹn ni bayi.
I really want a vacation.	Mo fe isinmi gaan.
But maybe not for long.	Ṣugbọn boya kii ṣe fun pipẹ.
This therefore becomes the first.	Eyi nitorina di akọkọ.
You’re doing the right thing.	O n ṣe ohun ti o tọ.
We are in it together.	A wa ninu rẹ papọ.
There are some trees, but not many.	Awọn igi kan wa, ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ.
They just don’t want to.	Wọn kan ko fẹ.
First build a fire.	Ni akọkọ kọ ina.
This even made me laugh.	Eyi paapaa mu mi rẹrin.
We will not let anyone force us to do anything.	A ko ni jẹ ki ẹnikẹni fi agbara mu wa lati ṣe ohunkohun.
It must have metal bodies.	O gbọdọ ni awọn ara ti irin.
Make us special.	Gbe wa pataki.
You can't get him to be in the room.	O ko le gba u lati wa ninu yara naa.
It may also take some time.	O tun le gba akoko kan.
I also want to see people inside me again.	Mo tun fẹ ri eniyan inu mi lẹẹkansi.
But we can do something about it.	Ṣugbọn a le ṣe nkankan nipa rẹ.
On their own tail.	Lori ara wọn iru.
You can just see it now.	O kan le rii ni bayi.
It just is.	O kan jẹ.
It bothers me a little and is not very good.	O rẹ mi diẹ ati pe ko dara pupọ.
Change the game.	Yi ere pada.
This is the story of our travels.	Eyi ni itan ti awọn irin-ajo wa.
It will be something you love to see more into it.	Yoo jẹ ohun ti o nifẹ lati wo diẹ sii sinu rẹ.
This city has a great history.	Ilu yii ni itan nla.
And miss it.	Ati ki o padanu rẹ.
You do not have to go out.	O ko ni lati jade.
Parents and everyone else.	Awọn obi ati gbogbo eniyan miiran.
Bought me out.	Ti ra mi jade.
You have to play to believe.	O ni lati mu ṣiṣẹ lati gbagbọ.
I do not want to know.	Emi ko fẹ lati mọ.
He looked at me and my head.	O wo mi o si mi ori.
This is not like you.	Eyi kii ṣe bi iwọ.
Some others do not.	Diẹ ninu awọn miiran ko.
And good.	O si dara.
I told him wisdom.	Mo sọ fun u ọgbọn.
The company went public.	Ile-iṣẹ naa lọ ni gbangba.
In some ways, this is understandable.	Ni diẹ ninu awọn ọna, eyi jẹ oye.
I am beautiful.	Mo lẹwa.
So I did.	Nitorina ni mo ṣe.
But there are problems here.	Ṣugbọn awọn iṣoro wa nibi.
These stories do not seem to be true.	Awọn itan wọnyi ko dabi otitọ.
I always expect amazing things to happen on this day.	Mo nigbagbogbo nireti awọn ohun iyanu lati ṣẹlẹ ni ọjọ yii.
See your pictures.	Wo awọn aworan rẹ.
No, that is not my life without power.	Rara, iyẹn kii ṣe igbesi aye mi laisi agbara.
Other than his hand, he had never moved.	Miiran ju ọwọ rẹ, o ti ko gbe.
Think about your best friend.	Ronu nipa ọrẹ rẹ to dara julọ.
It has been a difficult two months.	O ti jẹ oṣu meji ti o nira.
We haven't tried that yet.	A ko gbiyanju iyẹn sibẹsibẹ.
They can be moved.	Wọn ṣee gbe.
It should be easy to open.	O yẹ ki o rọrun lati ṣii.
At that point in time.	Ni akoko yẹn ni akoko.
You are not talking to one of us.	O ko ba ọkan ninu wa sọrọ.
Cannot be used with children under two.	Ko ṣee lo pẹlu awọn ọmọde labẹ meji.
You’ve said it yourself, it’s been a month.	O ti sọ funrararẹ, o ti jẹ oṣu.
Okay, that won't work.	O dara, iyẹn kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
I didn’t even enjoy it.	Emi ko paapaa gbadun rẹ.
He did not want to do such a thing.	Oun ko fẹ ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ.
That's what you see.	Ohun ti o ri niyẹn.
Like the beach.	Bi eti okun.
The heat from it was so amazing.	Ooru lati inu rẹ jẹ iyalẹnu pupọ.
We are born and die and that is it.	A bi ati pe a ku ati pe iyẹn ni.
He sat and stood.	O joko o si duro.
Obviously you have that.	O han gbangba pe o ni iyẹn.
This is something that seems very often.	Eyi ni ohun ti o dabi pupọ julọ igba.
But not now, not next year.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe bayi, kii ṣe ni ọdun to nbọ.
Your condition may not be noticeable in any test.	Ipo rẹ ko le ṣe akiyesi ni eyikeyi idanwo.
They all have difficult questions.	Gbogbo wọn ni awọn ibeere ti o nira.
I am not sure how.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bawo ni.
I do not know how many people are on the road.	Emi ko mọ iye eniyan ti o wa ni opopona.
We spend a lot of time going on a song.	A lo pupọ julọ akoko lati lọ lori orin kan.
It is a story told in our minds.	O jẹ itan ti a sọ ninu ọkan wa.
It reached into his pocket.	O de inu apo rẹ.
Nothing will surprise me.	Ko si ohun ti yoo ohun iyanu fun mi.
Or at least account for.	Tabi ni tabi ni o kere iroyin fun.
And we have space to say.	Ati pe a ni aye lati sọ.
I just can not do.	Mo kan ko le ṣe.
They are not even the same.	Wọn ko paapaa jẹ iru kanna.
But we know they don’t.	Ṣugbọn a mọ pe wọn ko ni.

They had a few minutes before he was killed.	Wọn ni iṣẹju diẹ ṣaaju ki o to pa a.
A tree of iron.	A igi ti irin.

They stood up to the police and said it was enough.	Wọn dide si awọn ọlọpa ati pe wọn sọ pe o to.
The story was not told to me.	A ko sọ itan naa fun mi.

Get out of here.	Lọ kuro ni ibi.
They agree that the plan is possible.	Wọn gba pe eto naa ṣee ṣe.
You can leave.	O le lọ kuro.
It can be changed again.	O le ṣee yipada lẹẹkansi.
Always try to do your best.	Gbiyanju nigbagbogbo lati ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
It doesn't matter how accurate you are.	Ko ṣe pataki bi o ṣe tọ.
Not that it should ever be, but it does.	Kii ṣe pe o yẹ ki o ni lailai, ṣugbọn o ṣe.
They will not accept.	Wọn kii yoo gba.
The sounds of the games are part of the rules.	Awọn ohun ti awọn ere jẹ ara awọn ofin.
But he kept his eyes on her.	Ṣugbọn o pa oju rẹ mọ lori rẹ.

I can feel the space opening.	Mo le lero aaye ti n ṣii.
I hate myself.	Mo korira ara mi.
Not anything.	Kii ṣe ohunkohun.
There is nothing you can do to stop it.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe lati da o duro.
He raised his eyes.	O gbe oju rẹ soke.
After you sleep, it will grow back.	Lẹhin ti o sun, yoo dagba pada.
I wanted to be functional.	Mo fe lati wa ni ti iṣẹ.
I told him he must look you up.	Mo ti sọ fun u pe o gbọdọ wo ọ soke.
Only value tracks.	Nikan awọn orin iye.
So he decided to play some games with them.	Nitorina o pinnu lati ṣe ere diẹ pẹlu wọn.
Now it’s time for me to ask more.	Bayi o to akoko fun mi lati beere diẹ.
The man told the truth.	Ọkunrin naa sọ otitọ.

And there is much more to come.	Ati pe ọpọlọpọ diẹ sii wa lati wa.
I don’t think it would be like this.	Emi ko ro pe yoo jẹ bi eyi.
But let the boy go.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki ọmọkunrin naa lọ.
So, why do we have to learn?	Nitorina, kilode ti a ni lati kọ ẹkọ?
That is not why he is here.	Eyi kii ṣe idi ti o fi wa nibi.
Wondering what that looks like.	Iyalẹnu kini iyẹn dabi.
They will not be able to make money the other way.	Wọn kii yoo ni anfani lati ṣe owo ni ọna miiran.
You can not live with them.	O ko le gbe pẹlu wọn.

At the port.	Ni ibudo pa.
No, you must not make me laugh.	Rara, o ko gbọdọ mu mi rẹrin.
They don't make too much sense.	Won ko ba ko ṣe ju Elo ori.
But that may not have gone for very long.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko le ti lọ fun pipẹ pupọ.
But if the kids eat anything, they are amazing.	Ṣugbọn ti awọn ọmọde ba jẹ ohunkohun, wọn jẹ iyalẹnu.

How the system works.	Bawo ni eto ṣiṣẹ.

The question is written.	Ti kọ ibeere naa.
I talked to my family, my husband about it.	Mo ti sọrọ si ebi mi, ọkọ mi nipa o.
Increase your energy.	Mu agbara rẹ.
He spoke again.	O tun sọrọ lẹẹkansi.
Your children have to be first.	Awọn ọmọ rẹ ni lati wa ni akọkọ.
I don't know how long he stayed there.	Ko mọ bi o ṣe gun to duro nibẹ.

But we need help.	Sugbon a nilo lati ri iranlọwọ.
She is wearing beautiful clothes.	O ti wọ lẹwa aṣọ.

This is something I will never forget.	Eyi jẹ nkan ti ko gbagbe.

Take life, do you!	Gba aye, ṣe iwọ!
One day at a time, just continue.	Ni ọjọ kan ni akoko kan, o kan tẹsiwaju.
We can also find ourselves.	A tun le wa ara wa.
I got up.	Mo ti gba soke.
He made himself, and nothing else.	O ṣe ara rẹ, ati pe ko si ohun miiran.
But the meeting never happened.	Ṣugbọn ipade naa ko ṣẹlẹ rara.
We made an appointment to meet early next week.	A ṣe ọjọ kan lati pade ni kutukutu ọsẹ ti n bọ.
So he decided not to use it.	Nitorina o pinnu lati ma lo.
The values ​​of the keys themselves do not matter.	Awọn iye ti awọn bọtini ara wọn ko ṣe pataki.
For me, one thing is for sure.	Fun mi, ohun kan jẹ daju.
I do not know what to do with it.	Emi ko mọ kini lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
Not here, not for him.	Ko si nibi, kii ṣe fun u.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.	Ko si iru eyi ti o ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
He asked if he would leave the city.	O beere boya oun yoo lọ kuro ni ilu naa.
It should have taken advantage of the opportunity to grow.	O yẹ ki o ti lo anfani lati dagba.
There is little need for long words.	Nibẹ ni kekere nilo fun gun ọrọ.
Do you love relaxation in the sun?	Ṣe o nifẹ isinmi ni oorun?
You will leave me.	Iwọ yoo fi mi silẹ.
You need to.	O nilo lati.
Yours is very beautiful.	Tirẹ lẹwa pupọ.
Up and down, up and down.	Soke ati isalẹ, si oke ati isalẹ.
We usually tell ourselves who we are.	A maa n sọ fun ara wa ẹni ti o jẹ.
However, sometimes it is not easy.	Sibẹsibẹ, nigba miiran kii ṣe rọrun.
I know it doesn't matter.	Mo mọ pe ko ṣe pataki.
Have any of you used that program before?	Njẹ ọkan ninu yin ti lo eto yẹn tẹlẹ?
I am very happy with their work.	Inu mi dun pupọ pẹlu iṣẹ wọn.
But that is not the way it is.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọna ti o jẹ gaan.
They are not always, but your father is.	Wọn kii ṣe nigbagbogbo, ṣugbọn baba rẹ jẹ.
The man did not even try with it.	Ọkunrin naa ko paapaa gbiyanju pẹlu rẹ.
I made no mistake.	Emi ko ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
I understand time.	Mo loye akoko.
Maybe for hours.	Boya fun awọn wakati.
Fortunately, they are all ears.	O da, gbogbo wọn jẹ eti.
If we try both, we will have time to stop.	Ti a ba gbiyanju awọn mejeeji, a yoo ni akoko lati da.
You lost your job, and you should have.	O padanu iṣẹ rẹ, ati pe o yẹ ki o ni.
I think you should not be here.	Mo ro pe o ko yẹ ki o wa nibi.
But those are stories for another season.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ awọn itan fun akoko miiran.
I am hungry.	Ebi mi dara.
Why, in my day.	Kilode, ni ọjọ mi.
Things are not so simple.	Ohun ni o wa ko ki o rọrun.
I have enough books to have a bookstore.	Mo ni awọn iwe ti o to lati ni ile itaja iwe kan.
I lost my money.	Mo ti padanu owo mi.
You have to pay a higher price.	O gbọdọ san owo ti o ga.
At night it is nice to enter other houses.	Ni alẹ o jẹ ohun to dara lati wọ awọn ile miiran.
We are all in the game.	Gbogbo wa ni ere.
This situation does not last long.	Ipo yii ko le pẹ.
That made everyone laugh.	Iyẹn jẹ ki gbogbo eniyan rẹrin.
Friends made.	Awọn ọrẹ ti a ṣe.
Or it can turn out to be anything.	Tabi o le yipada lati jẹ ohunkohun.
We are done.	A ti ṣe.
Can you find the error?	Ṣe o le rii aṣiṣe naa?
I will try to stay in your way.	Emi yoo gbiyanju lati duro ni ọna rẹ.
You have a good life.	O ni igbesi aye to dara.
Has worked well for a while.	Ti ṣiṣẹ daradara fun igba diẹ.
You can explain.	O le ṣe alaye.
In the end, he could not.	Ni ipari, ko le.
It is not enough to kill him.	O ko to lati pa a.
Not sure if it does.	Ko daju boya o ṣe.
I sent it to him.	Mo ranṣẹ si i.
He said this could not happen.	O sọ pe eyi ko le ṣẹlẹ.
He has not stopped.	Ko tii duro.
And we have great people out there right now.	Ati pe a ni awọn eniyan nla wa nibẹ ni bayi.
Both have happened to me.	Awọn mejeeji ti ṣẹlẹ si mi.
Add water to it.	Fi omi si i.
I wish we knew you had time.	Mo fẹ a mọ ti o ni akoko.
I'm very happy now.	Inu mi dun pupo ni bayi.
He is leaving me.	O n fi mi silẹ.
You do not need love.	O ko nilo ife.
His name is spelled out in the letter.	Orukọ rẹ ni a ti fọ sinu lẹta naa.
You know it’s not about you.	O mọ pe kii ṣe nipa rẹ.
That in itself would be difficult.	Iyẹn funrararẹ yoo nira.
You haven't heard anything yet.	O ko tii gbọ nkankan sibẹsibẹ.
The man returned home.	Ọkunrin naa pada sẹhin si ile.
No, it can happen to anyone.	Rara, o le ṣẹlẹ si ẹnikẹni.
Some will lose their homes, some will not.	Diẹ ninu awọn yoo padanu ile wọn, diẹ ninu awọn kii yoo.
Much can happen at that time.	Pupọ le ṣẹlẹ ni akoko yẹn.
Good for you.	O dara fun e.
But there is no reason.	Sugbon ko si idi.
In fact, that’s where you got your first one.	Ni otitọ, iyẹn ni ibi ti o ti gba ọkan akọkọ rẹ.
Will not tell me what you see.	Yoo ko so fun mi ohun ti o ri.
Something very serious.	Nkan to ṣe pataki pupọ.
And yet it is.	Ati sibẹsibẹ o wa.
I stopped the bill.	Mo gbe owo naa duro.
He kept it on purpose.	O si pa o lori idi.
The music itself, however, is very good.	Orin funrararẹ, sibẹsibẹ, dara julọ.
Maybe that continues to be seen.	Boya iyẹn tẹsiwaju lati rii.
Some go into family business.	Diẹ ninu awọn lọ sinu ebi owo.
It is a woman's body.	Ara obinrin ni.
It's too late, you know.	O pẹ, o mọ.
I do not like to do anything.	Emi ko nifẹ lati ṣe ohunkohun.
Every day was the same.	Gbogbo ọjọ je kanna.
You are right, physically.	O tọ, nipa ti ara.
See all of these books.	Wo gbogbo awọn iwe wọnyi.
That's the word we get.	Iyẹn ni ọrọ ti a gba.
You want more, and more.	O fẹ diẹ sii, ati diẹ sii wa.
Some children also learn to read and write here.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọde tun kọ ẹkọ lati ka ati kọ nibi.
There is one in everyone.	Ọkan wa ninu gbogbo eniyan.
I could not care less.	Ko kan mi.

Children are very important.	Awọn ọmọde ni pataki julọ.
There is something that has not been heard.	Ohun kan wa ti ko tii gbọ.
I am honest without anyone to hear.	Emi ni otitọ laisi ẹnikan lati gbọ.

He could not seem to do so anymore.	Ko le dabi lati ṣe bẹ mọ.

People took them, but not enough.	Eniyan mu wọn, sugbon ko to.

Or can not.	Tabi ko le.
The situation is great.	Ipo je nla.
I should really work on making that happen.	Mo yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ gaan lori ṣiṣe iyẹn ṣẹlẹ.
Everyone is looking at them, it is better to look at the group around them.	Gbogbo eniyan n wo wọn, o dara julọ wo ẹgbẹ ti o wa ni ayika wọn.
That no one will ever love me.	Pe ko si ọkan yoo lailai ni ife mi.
He came to me.	O wa si mi.

Now and again you will let me feed them.	Bayi ati lẹẹkansi o yoo jẹ ki mi bọ wọn.

I can't figure out what the problem might be.	Emi ko le ṣiṣẹ jade kini iṣoro naa le jẹ.
There may be something we can do.	Ohun kan le wa ti a le ṣe.
He asked me what the plan was.	O beere lọwọ mi kini eto naa.
But things are not good at home.	Ṣugbọn awọn nkan ko dara ni ile.
This can be understood in several ways.	Eyi le ni oye ni awọn ọna pupọ.
He did nothing.	Oun ko ṣe ohunkohun.
So you can't think so.	Nitorina o ko le ro bẹ.
We need to work harder.	A nilo lati ṣiṣẹ le.
It has everything you need.	O ni ohun gbogbo ti o nilo.
The work has been great too.	Iṣẹ ti jẹ nla paapaa.
And we see it grow.	Ati pe a rii pe o dagba.
Homes are not money.	Awọn ile kii ṣe owo.
You need to put yourself in your place.	O nilo lati fi ara rẹ si ipo rẹ.
There seems to always be more to know.	O dabi enipe o wa nigbagbogbo diẹ sii lati mọ.

Send everyone home or that day.	Fi gbogbo eniyan ranṣẹ si ile tabi ọjọ naa.
He did not think through it.	Oun ko ronu nipasẹ rẹ.
To be a doctor here is a miracle.	Lati jẹ dokita nibi jẹ iṣẹ iyanu kan.
Remember my thoughts.	Ranti awọn ero mi.
Another reason to hate rainy days.	Idi miiran lati korira awọn ọjọ ojo.
And at the same time.	Ati ni akoko paapaa.
That is what you are all here to do.	Ohun ti gbogbo yin wa nibi lati se niyen.
The problem started a few months ago.	Iṣoro naa bẹrẹ ni oṣu diẹ sẹhin.
They do it because the job needs it.	Wọn ṣe nitori pe iṣẹ naa nilo rẹ.
Children learn best by doing.	Awọn ọmọde kọ ẹkọ ti o dara julọ nipa ṣiṣe.

Obviously the girl is important.	O han gbangba pe ọmọbirin naa ṣe pataki.
Good time to die.	Akoko ti o dara lati ku.

Now he is probably dead too.	Ni bayi o ṣee ṣe pe o ti ku pẹlu.
I do it now, and it is a great help.	Mo ṣe ni bayi, ati pe o jẹ iranlọwọ nla.
But tell your mother.	Ṣugbọn sọ fun iya rẹ.
I will not get anything done.	Mo ti yoo ko gba ohunkohun ṣe.
And let them not know.	Ki wọn ko si mọ.
At the end of the day’s work is a very important thing.	Ni ipari iṣẹ ọjọ jẹ ohun ti o ṣe pataki.
Even better.	Ohun ti o dara paapaa.
Some of these men brought their families here.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọkunrin wọnyi mu idile wọn wa si ibi.
Working around is to move one at a time.	Ṣiṣẹ ni ayika ni lati gbe ọkan ni akoko kan.
You have a way about it really.	O ni ọna kan nipa rẹ gaan.
We do not know this.	A ko ba ti mọ eyi.
I hope that makes sense.	Mo nireti pe iyẹn jẹ oye.
These things can not be.	Awọn nkan wọnyi ko le jẹ.
We want to change the world.	A fẹ yi aye pada.
And the people who died.	Ati awọn eniyan ti o ku.
It could be this way or that way.	O le jẹ ọna yii tabi ọna naa.
Everyone who learns knows how important art is.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o kọ ẹkọ mọ bi aworan ṣe ṣe pataki.
There must be other ways to make money.	Awọn ọna miiran gbọdọ wa lati ṣe owo.
Need to know.	Nilo lati mọ.
I left school.	Mo kuro ni ile-iwe.
We enjoyed an amazing vacation.	A gbadun isinmi iyalẹnu kan.
And something that starts early.	Ati pe nkan ti o bẹrẹ ni kutukutu.
I have a car.	Mo ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
We saw some of that last year.	A rii diẹ ninu iyẹn ni ọdun to kọja.
He made her sit on the edge of the bed.	O mu u joko lori eti ibusun naa.
I think this needs to change.	Mo ro pe eyi nilo lati yipada.
The team car did the same.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ẹgbẹ naa ṣe kanna.
The same goes for our wedding.	Ohun kan naa n lọ fun igbeyawo wa.
And it’s good, though.	Ati pe o dara, paapaa.
It's time to move on.	O to akoko lati gbe soke.
And all the city went to her marriage.	Gbogbo ilu si lọ si igbeyawo rẹ.
Than thought of everything he wanted to enjoy.	Ju ti ro ti ohun gbogbo ti o fe gbadun.
He heard his problems.	O gbọ awọn iṣoro rẹ.
No need to look up.	Ko nilo lati wo soke.
Often, he decided to eat.	Nigbagbogbo, o pinnu lati jẹ.
We cannot return.	A ko le pada.
Well, at least we got one of the two right.	O dara, o kere ju a gba ọkan ninu meji ti o tọ.
Life would be better if we did.	Aye yoo dara julọ ti a ba ṣe.
The top is wood.	Oke ti wa ni igi.
Anyone who does this to me.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ba ṣe eyi si mi.
They tell their stories.	Wọn sọ awọn itan wọn.
I know how to get.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe gba.
The weather is nice.	Oju ojo dara.
Where is my phone?	Nibo ni foonu mi wa?
That is why we are able to do that.	O jẹ idi ti a ni anfani lati ṣe iyẹn.
And the other is.	Ati awọn miiran jẹ.
Not even for a day.	Ko paapaa fun ọjọ kan.
I have not decided to provoke him.	Emi ko ti pinnu lati bi i ninu.
They will keep silent.	Wọn yoo pa ẹnu mọ́.
You must be very good.	O gbọdọ dara julọ.
Than you can do what you want with this.	Ju o le ṣe ohun ti o fẹ pẹlu eyi.
To do so you have to spend some time in your home.	Lati ṣe bẹẹ o ni lati lo akoko diẹ ninu ile rẹ.
Let's eat there tonight.	Jẹ ki a jẹun nibẹ ni alẹ oni.
That means something to him.	Eyi tumọ si nkankan fun u.
Do not be too angry.	Maṣe binu pupọ.
He hopes the project can be completed soon.	O nireti pe iṣẹ naa le pari laipẹ.
This is, above all, an important skill.	Eyi jẹ, ju gbogbo awọn ohun miiran lọ, ọgbọn pataki.
John didn’t even wait for me to ask him.	John ko paapaa duro fun mi lati beere lọwọ rẹ.
I make rules.	Mo ṣe awọn ofin.
Sometimes, long days when the sun does not rise.	Nigba miiran, awọn ọjọ gun nigbati oorun ko ba dide.
Walk on through time.	Rin lori nipasẹ akoko.
It worries me.	O ṣe aniyan mi.
I will work and you will go to school.	Emi yoo ṣiṣẹ ati pe iwọ yoo lọ si ile-iwe.
I already called one.	Mo ti pe ọkan tẹlẹ.
Let the police handle this.	Jẹ ki ọlọpa mu eyi.
But their purpose is and never forget it.	Ṣugbọn idi wọn ni ati maṣe gbagbe rẹ lailai.
At least after a while.	O kere ju lẹhin igba diẹ.
Tomorrow is going to be great.	Ọla ti wa ni lilọ lati wa ni nla.
Some have time.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni akoko.
Up things down.	Soke ohun isalẹ.
Boys will be boys !.	Awọn ọmọkunrin yoo jẹ ọmọkunrin!.
He had decided his heart, and stood by it.	O ti pinnu ọkan rẹ, o si duro lori rẹ.
But we don’t really need to tell.	Sugbon a ko gan nilo lati so fun.
He refuses to be photographed by school children.	O kọ lati ya aworan nipasẹ awọn ọmọde ile-iwe.
However, these values ​​must be determined from the test.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn iye wọnyi gbọdọ pinnu lati idanwo.
It should not be too important.	Ko yẹ ki o ṣe pataki pupọ.
We ate well now.	A jẹun daradara ni bayi.
I don’t have to love it.	Emi ko ni lati nifẹ rẹ.
He left very soon after his career was over.	O fi silẹ pupọ diẹ lẹhin ti iṣẹ rẹ ti pari.
This can be done in two ways.	Eyi le ṣee ṣe ni ọna meji.
The work requires physical.	Iṣẹ naa n beere nipa ti ara.
Do something relaxing for you.	Ṣe nkan ti o ni isinmi fun ọ.
No one to be found.	Ko si ọkan lati wa ni ri.
And he did very well.	Ati pe o ṣe daradara julọ.
The sister also felt.	Arabinrin naa tun lero.
Just walk.	O kan rin.
I love to see your mouth open to me.	Mo nifẹ lati rii ẹnu rẹ ti n ṣii si mi.
So you keep your thoughts to yourself.	Nitorina o pa awọn ero rẹ mọ si ara rẹ.
He asked to meet her.	O beere lati pade rẹ.
We are having a good time.	A n ṣe akoko ti o dara.
There is a house to walk a minute from here.	Ile kan wa lati rin iṣẹju kan lati ibi.
I think he was looking at me from the back seat.	Mo ro pe o n wo mi lati ijoko ẹhin.
Or anyone who knows.	Tabi ẹnikẹni ti o mọ.
How hot is the water?	Bawo ni omi gbona?
It’s noticeable even if you just start.	O ṣe akiyesi paapaa ti o ba kan bẹrẹ.
It is your time now.	O jẹ akoko tirẹ ni bayi.
I don’t know how one person did that.	Emi ko mọ bi eniyan kan ṣe ṣe iyẹn.
They will tell you how to make them like you.	Wọn yoo sọ fun ọ bi o ṣe le ṣe wọn bi iwọ.
It also comes as a surprise.	O tun wa bi iyalẹnu.
Or that there is a law firm.	Tabi pe ile-iṣẹ ofin wa.
You have a good feeling for the game and make good decisions.	O ni rilara ti o dara fun ere ati ṣe awọn ipinnu to dara.
The built-in system is very powerful.	Eto ti a ṣe ni agbara pupọ.
I was just happy to get off my feet.	Inu mi kan dun lati kuro ni ẹsẹ mi.
Be this way.	Jẹ ọna yii.
Drive even better.	Wakọ paapaa dara julọ.
They won’t say, maybe they didn’t think it through that much.	Wọn kii yoo sọ, boya wọn ko ronu rẹ nipasẹ iyẹn pupọ.
However, this is not the only problem area.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi kii ṣe agbegbe iṣoro nikan.
We are looking at three houses tonight.	A n wo ile mẹta ni alẹ oni.
That's how the law works.	Bi ofin ṣe n ṣiṣẹ niyẹn.
It has been.	O ti jẹ bẹ.
You want to read my heart.	O fẹ ka ọkan mi.
Why you wouldn't do it.	Idi ti o yoo ko se o.
But that happened.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ṣẹlẹ.
I don’t think we will ever.	Emi ko ro pe a yoo lailai.
Sure it works around here.	O daju pe o ṣiṣẹ ni ayika ibi.
It’s a job every summer.	O jẹ iṣẹ ti gbogbo ọjọ ooru kan.
For two days after that he could not go to school.	Fun ọjọ meji lẹhin iyẹn ko le lọ si ile-iwe.
We will stop them.	A yoo da wọn duro.
They are more beautiful than any other you have ever made.	Wọn lẹwa diẹ sii ju eyikeyi miiran ti o ti ṣe.
But he was very angry with himself.	Ṣugbọn o binu pupọ fun ara rẹ.
And that's not what it is.	Ati awọn ti o ni ko ohun ti o jẹ.
This is the ideal situation.	Eyi ni ipo ti o dara julọ.
Remember, there will be other benefits.	Ranti, awọn anfani miiran yoo wa.
I can't understand it.	Emi ko le loye rẹ.
I think it should be with me.	Mo ro pe o yẹ ki o wa pẹlu mi.
We are honest and not afraid to be ourselves.	A jẹ otitọ ati pe ko bẹru lati jẹ ara wa.
This is not.	Eyi kii ṣe.
Always look for the good.	Nigbagbogbo wo fun awọn ti o dara.
How much time will it take to do it the other way around.	Elo akoko ti yoo gba lati ṣe ni ọna miiran.
She hurried, hurried to the driveway.	O yara, o sare lọ si ọna ọkọ.
I would love to see it like this.	Mo feran lati ri i bi eleyi.
It should not be a problem.	Ko yẹ ki o jẹ iṣoro.
This is one.	Eyi jẹ ọkan.
The school is not in a good area either.	Ile-iwe ko si ni agbegbe ti o dara boya.
They are just a little better than the other teams.	Wọn kan diẹ dara ju awọn ẹgbẹ miiran lọ.
I accept this.	Mo gba eleyi.
I do not know why.	Nko mo idi.
This is a great opportunity.	Eyi je anfani nla kan.
Many people have said that you should remove it.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ti sọ pe o yẹ ki o yọ ọ kuro.
Neither does anyone else, in fact.	Bẹni ko ni ẹnikẹni miiran, ni otitọ.
They can teach others soon.	Wọn le kọ awọn miiran laipẹ.
Life is much easier now.	Igbesi aye rọrun pupọ ni bayi.
I don’t think anyone can !.	Emi ko ro pe ẹnikẹni le!.
It’s time someone knew.	O to akoko ti ẹnikan mọ.
There are some things that money cannot buy.	Awọn nkan kan wa ti owo ko le ra.
I asked if he knew her and she said she knew.	Mo beere boya o mọ ọ ati pe o sọ pe o mọ.
Just look at it to see it !.	Nikan wo o lati ri i!.
In this program.	Ninu eto yi.
The sister did not expect to agree with him.	Arabinrin naa ko nireti pe yoo gba pẹlu rẹ.
I will tell you about this little meal.	Emi yoo sọ fun ọ nipa ounjẹ kekere yii.
We have seen it across the kill lot.	A ti wo rẹ kọja awọn pa pupo.
There is police work to be done.	Iṣẹ ọlọpa wa lati ṣe.
It is our time to try our way.	O jẹ akoko wa lati gbiyanju ọna wa.
He sold the box and life together.	O ta apoti ati igbesi aye papọ.
He takes her hand.	O gba ọwọ rẹ.
It helps a lot.	O ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
It was amazing, and amazing.	O je iyanu, ati iyanu.
It's hot.	O gbona.
Some, hearing the story, do not believe it.	Diẹ ninu awọn, ti o gbọ itan naa, ko gbagbọ.
But we know why.	Ṣugbọn a mọ idi.
And others as well.	Ati awọn miiran pẹlu.
A letter was sent.	A fi lẹta ranṣẹ.
But two things went wrong.	Sugbon ohun meji ti lọ ti ko tọ.
This city is alive with music.	Ilu yi wa laaye pẹlu ohun orin.
First, warm water.	Ni akọkọ, omi gbona.
Talk about them.	Sọ nipa wọn.
Our program will start in a few minutes.	Eto wa yoo bẹrẹ ni iṣẹju diẹ.
He never used them.	Ko lo wọn rara.
But they always work.	Ṣugbọn wọn nigbagbogbo ṣiṣẹ.
Understand for yourself how the program works.	Loye fun ara rẹ bi eto naa ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
Under the table, he felt a small box.	Labẹ tabili, o ro apoti kekere kan.
I am not anxious or afraid or angry.	Emi ko ni aniyan tabi bẹru tabi binu.
He said a word.	O sọ ọrọ kan.
I just want to write this song.	Mo kan fẹ kọ orin yii.
My father bought my mother, you see.	Baba mi ra iya mi, o ri.
I have no idea what they are, but you are talking back.	Emi ko ni imọran kini wọn jẹ, ṣugbọn o n sọrọ pada.
Their cottages.	Awọn ile kekere wọn.
But you should definitely see for yourself.	Ṣugbọn o yẹ ki o rii fun ara rẹ gaan.
He looked into her eyes.	O wo inu oju rẹ.
We have been married for many years without children.	A ti ṣe igbeyawo fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun laisi ọmọ.
And of course it’s worth it.	Ati pe dajudaju o tọ.
It has a room.	O ni yara kan.
At this point it is enough.	Ni aaye yii o ti ni to.
Not what you want, but will do for the time being.	Kii ṣe ohun ti o fẹ, ṣugbọn yoo ṣe fun igba naa.
Picked up.	Ti gbe soke.
I want to give you the same life.	Mo fẹ lati fun ọ ni aye kanna.
He turned to his side.	O yipada si ẹgbẹ rẹ.
The child did not do well.	Ọmọ naa ko ṣe daradara.
One of them was dressed.	Ọkan ninu wọn ti wọ aṣọ.
Because it was.	Nitori ti o wà.
Soon none of them were on their feet.	Laipẹ ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o wa ni ẹsẹ wọn.
She has a son from her first marriage.	O ni ọmọkunrin kan lati igbeyawo akọkọ rẹ.
You expect that.	O nireti iyẹn.
It is very good not to notice.	O dara pupọ lati ma ṣe akiyesi.
I can talk about your face.	Mo le sọ nipa oju rẹ.
I picked this up here and there.	Mo ti gbe yi soke nibi ati nibẹ.
Less paid materials.	Kere awọn ohun elo ti o san.
You can help me, if you want.	O le ran mi lọwọ, ti o ba fẹ.
Your feet don’t really work.	Awọn ẹsẹ rẹ ko ṣiṣẹ ni otitọ.
We own the house.	A ni ile naa.
One by one, they fell asleep.	Ọkan nipa ọkan, wọn sun oorun.
Kiss your hair.	Fi ẹnu ko irun rẹ.
But think what you want too.	Ṣugbọn ro ohun ti o fẹ ju.
I see what can’t be there.	Mo rii ohun ti ko le wa nibẹ.
I can't hear you.	Emi ko le gbọ tirẹ.
You know.	O mọ.
Do you really want to get them?	Ṣe o fẹ gaan lati gba wọn lọ?
I call this a missed opportunity.	Mo pe eyi ni anfani ti o padanu.
We will take out the special time.	A yoo ya jade ni pataki akoko.
Their meeting for a long time.	Ipade wọn fun igba pipẹ.
One of my friends died, too.	Ọkan ninu awọn ọrẹ mi kan ku, paapaa.
Not good to see that way.	Ko dara lati rii ni ọna yẹn.
Drink from the inside.	Mu lati inu.
It takes a few minutes to find your thing.	O gba diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹju diẹ lati wa ohun tirẹ.
However, this is an ideal location for the area.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi jẹ ipo ti o dara julọ fun agbegbe naa.
People who go that route do it for a reason.	Awọn eniyan ti o lọ ni ọna yẹn ṣe fun idi kan.
You will think of something.	Iwọ yoo ronu nkan kan.
Don’t think it makes more sense for you to.	Maṣe ro pe o jẹ oye diẹ sii fun ọ lati.
The cat does not know where he is.	Ọmọ ologbo naa ko mọ ibiti o wa.
In this way.	Ni ọna yi .
Ask yourself why.	Beere lọwọ ararẹ idi ti iyẹn.
We are in bed again.	A wa lori ibusun lẹẹkansi.
In the chair, little girl.	Ni ijoko, ọmọbirin kekere.
Here, however, there is no such length and the end result.	Nibi, sibẹsibẹ, ko si iru ipari ati ipari ipari.
Not as we know it.	Kii ṣe bi a ti mọ.
But this is not the whole story.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe gbogbo itan naa.
I will not, ever without your book.	Emi kii yoo, lailai laisi iwe rẹ.
Not so those in office in other worlds.	Ko ṣe bẹ awọn ti o wa ni ọfiisi ni awọn aye miiran.
Well, you probably got used to it.	O dara, o ṣee ṣe pe o ti lo si.
To see your face.	Lati wo oju rẹ.
He intends to pass the test.	O ni aniyan lati kọja ninu idanwo naa.
This changed over time.	Eyi yipada ni akoko pupọ.
They give us a contract that we cannot write.	Wọn fun wa ni adehun ti a ko le kọ.
We had no food or water at all.	A ko ni ounjẹ tabi omi rara.
I have seen this before.	Mo ti rii eyi tẹlẹ.
I do not want to think of it as old.	Emi ko fẹ lati ro rẹ bi atijọ.
You have done well.	O ti ṣe daradara.
The end is too late for most people.	Ipari wa pẹ ju fun ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
But if so, don't let it continue.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba jẹ bẹ, ko jẹ ki o tẹsiwaju.
It's about three hours.	O to wakati mẹta.
The world is a small space, isn't it?	Aye jẹ aaye kekere kan, ṣe kii ṣe bẹ?
They do this with little obvious difficulty.	Wọn ṣe eyi pẹlu iṣoro kekere ti o han gbangba.
It went about the same time we did.	O lọ nipa akoko kanna ti a ṣe.
She wanted to help but could not.	O fẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ ṣugbọn o ko le.
It comes from the back.	O wa lati ẹhin.
Get something for yourself.	Gba nkankan fun ara rẹ.
We are back home.	A ti pada si ile.
Outdoor location.	Ipo ita gbangba.
For this to work, you have to be human.	Fun eyi lati ṣiṣẹ, o ni lati jẹ eniyan.
After thinking about it, he decided he did not understand.	Lẹhin ti o ronu nipa rẹ, o pinnu pe ko ni oye.
It helps to know that someone is there looking for them.	O ṣe iranlọwọ lati mọ pe ẹnikan wa nibẹ ti n wa wọn.
Things don’t have to go wrong.	Awọn nkan ko ni lati lọ si aṣiṣe.
Two people were killed.	Eniyan meji ti pa.
Many of us do.	Pupọ wa ṣe.
People are not like that.	Awọn eniyan kii ṣe iru bẹ.
I was leaving home, I only took a small box.	Mo n lọ kuro ni ile, apoti kekere nikan ni mo mu.
Everyone here knows the office.	Gbogbo eniyan nibi mọ ọfiisi.
He does not know who he is, who he is.	Ko mọ ẹni ti o jẹ, tani eyikeyi ninu wọn.
If you want to leave that, that's fine.	Ti o ba fẹ fi silẹ ni iyẹn, iyẹn dara.
It is too late to return.	O ti pẹ ju lati pada.
My house is not enough.	Ile mi ko to.
You will never have heard of this.	Iwọ kii yoo ti gbọ eyi.
It takes some work to maintain them.	O gba iṣẹ diẹ lati tọju wọn.
I know you can't.	Mo mọ pe ko le.
You want to.	Se o fe se.
But that should grow over time.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn yẹ ki o dagba ni akoko pupọ.
He looked at me, into me.	O ti wo mi, sinu mi.
I tried to let him bring me back.	Mo gbiyanju lati jẹ ki o mu mi pada.
Any type of homework will damage the wood.	Eyikeyi iru iṣẹ ile yoo ba igi jẹ.
Because of what the world is.	Nitori ohun ti aye jẹ.
Some people don’t grow up.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ko dagba.
If you have children, you will love them.	Ti o ba ni awọn ọmọde, iwọ yoo nifẹ wọn.
We do not know.	A ko mọ ọ.
Leave me in it.	Fi mi silẹ ninu rẹ.
To find all images.	Lati wa gbogbo awọn aworan.
Here is a picture of my family.	Eyi ni aworan ti idile mi.
Call me if you need to.	Pe mi ti o ba nilo.
The bed is still in place.	Ibusun si tun wa ni ipo.
I learned from this.	Mo kọ ẹkọ lati inu eyi.
What are the tasks.	Kini awọn iṣẹ ṣiṣe.
There are several cars in the driveway.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ pupọ lo wa ninu awakọ naa.
Swim with them.	Ti we pẹlu wọn.
I need to do something amazing.	Mo nilo lati ṣe nkan iyanu.
We may doubt it at times.	A le ṣiyemeji rẹ ni awọn igba miiran.
It’s not that I don’t want to, I do.	Kii ṣe pe Emi ko fẹ, Mo ṣe.
Either way, you have to.	Ni ọna kan, o ni.
I look back.	Mo wo pada.
But you have such desires.	Ṣugbọn o ni iru awọn ifẹ.
The company's offices are nearby.	Awọn ọfiisi ti ile-iṣẹ wa nitosi.
You can look at the dining table.	O le wo tabili ounjẹ.
That brings down costs.	Ti o mu isalẹ awọn iye owo.
It is full of energy.	O ti kun si agbara.
I don’t think it’s either in those two words.	Emi ko ro pe o jẹ boya ninu awọn ọrọ meji yẹn.
But it is what.	Sugbon o jẹ ohun ti.
I have to continue.	Mo ni lati tẹsiwaju.
This is for a reason.	Eyi jẹ fun idi kan.
This is the last stop.	Eleyi jẹ awọn ti o kẹhin Duro.
I will be back soon.	Emi yoo pada wa laipẹ.
The doors open.	Awọn ilẹkun ṣii.
You should have thought about that before.	O yẹ ki o ti ronu nipa iyẹn tẹlẹ.
However, there seem to be many questions about when.	Sibẹsibẹ, o dabi pe ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere tun wa nipa nigbawo.
He saw the fire.	O ri ina.
You do not know why you have to say anything.	O ko mọ idi ti o fi ni lati sọ ohunkohun.
You just need to decide to go around.	O kan nilo lati pinnu lati lọ ni ayika.
You have come to this.	O ti de si eyi.
I would like to know.	Emi yoo fẹ lati mọ.
Find for yourself.	Wa fun ara rẹ.
Of course it has attracted me.	Dajudaju o ti fa si mi.
Who is watching you.	Tani o n wo o.
And you have to tell someone.	Ati pe o ni lati sọ fun ẹnikan.
How tall are you.	Bawo ni o ṣe ga to.
We are not so.	A ko ri bẹ bẹ.
Don't let them go.	Maṣe jẹ ki wọn lọ.
Maybe he’s getting his way.	Boya o n gba ọna rẹ.
This is incredibly hard to do.	Eleyi jẹ ti iyalẹnu gidigidi lati ṣe.
That was my first thought.	Iyẹn ni ero akọkọ mi.
We hope to talk to you soon !.	A nireti lati ba ọ sọrọ laipẹ!.
I had trouble finding the boat.	Mo ni iṣoro lati rii ọkọ oju omi naa.
I have an idea.	Mo ni ero.
I'm still around.	Mo tun wa ni ayika.
I can wait until tomorrow.	Mo ti le duro titi ọla.
That's even easier.	Iyẹn rọrun paapaa.
It's very simple.	O rọrun pupọ.
There are mountains in the nearby mountains.	Awọn oke nla wa ni awọn oke ti o wa nitosi.
You are the only one.	Iwọ nikan ni.
And boy did you play.	Ati ọmọkunrin ṣe o dun.
It is all around.	O ti wa ni ayika.
Look at the body.	Wo ara.
It can work for both cars and minibuses.	O le ṣe iṣẹ fun awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mejeeji ati ọkọ akero kekere.
I was able to love.	Mo ni anfani lati nifẹ.
It was my job to go down with the car.	O jẹ iṣẹ mi lati lọ si isalẹ pẹlu ọkọ.
None of this is good for our future.	Ko si eyi ti o dara fun ojo iwaju wa.
Have any ideas where you can find?	Ṣe eyikeyi ero ibi ti o ti le ri?
It may be a good idea to tell someone about it.	O le jẹ imọran ti o dara lati sọ fun ẹnikan nipa rẹ.
That was before you were born.	Iyẹn jẹ ṣaaju ki a to bi ọ.
But very soon it was over.	Ṣugbọn pupọ laipẹ o ti pari.
He would try to get me to leave a ringtone.	Oun yoo gbiyanju lati gba mi lati fi ohun orin silẹ.
The brother is gone.	Arakunrin naa ti lọ.
The boys will be here in an hour.	Awọn ọmọkunrin yoo wa nibi ni wakati kan.
Don't look down.	Maṣe wo isalẹ.
Everything has to be your own way.	Ohun gbogbo ni lati jẹ ọna tirẹ.
Interested group trips can be found here, too.	Awọn irin-ajo ẹgbẹ ti o nifẹ le ṣee rii nibi, paapaa.
But not that way.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọna yẹn.
Read your newsletter.	Ka iwe iroyin rẹ.
It has taken a lot of money.	O ti gba owo pupọ.
The road behind the school needs to be rebuilt.	Opopona ti o wa lẹhin ile-iwe nilo lati tun ṣe.
You do not know everything.	O ko mọ ohun gbogbo.
It does not need much water.	Ko nilo omi pupọ.
I should lose my reason.	Mo yẹ ki o padanu idi mi.
This is for him.	Eyi jẹ fun u.
He did so when he was living alone.	O ṣe bẹ nigbati o ti n gbe nikan.
That is not true.	Iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
What do you want to eat today?	Kini o fẹ jẹ loni?
That is not upon us.	Iyẹn ko wa lori wa.
This is just the same.	Eleyi jẹ o kan kanna.
Tell us what you think.	Sọ ohun ti o ro fun wa.
You will be happy.	Inu re yoo dun.
I have to eat.	Mo ni lati jẹun.
It has grown great.	O ti dagba nla.
You believe me.	O gba mi gbọ.
I do not need to see a doctor.	Nko nilo lati ri dokita.
There are a lot of games.	Nibẹ ni o wa kan pupo ti awọn ere.
I love it all.	Mo fẹran rẹ ni gbogbo rẹ.
And that is perhaps the most important fact.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ boya otitọ pataki julọ.
The question was never asked.	A ko beere ibeere naa rara.
I'm glad you came.	Inu mi dun pe o ti wa.
This looks amazing, brother.	Eyi wo iyanu, arakunrin.
But that’s there to see.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn wa lati rii.
When the time came, they ended their lives.	Nigbati akoko ba de, wọn pari aye wọn.
It will make it very hard.	Yoo jẹ ki o le pupọ.
I am very tired.	O rẹ mi pupọ.
I wish everyone around here had some of that.	Mo fẹ pe gbogbo eniyan ni ayika nibi ni diẹ ninu iyẹn.
Maybe I don't know how it works.	Boya Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
You still feel.	O tun lero.
That is very difficult to do.	Iyẹn nira pupọ lati ṣe.
He had kept it there with him.	O ti pa a mọ nibẹ pẹlu rẹ.
There is something wrong with this situation.	Nkankan wa ti ko tọ pẹlu ipo yii.
She always goes out for dinner.	O nigbagbogbo jade fun ounjẹ alẹ.
If not, your life will be harder.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, igbesi aye rẹ yoo le.
For the trees this question is well understood.	Fun awọn igi ibeere yii ni oye daradara.
The plane has arrived late.	Ọkọ ofurufu ti pẹ de.
I would make a better position.	Emi yoo ṣe ipo ti o dara julọ.
Okay, two things.	O dara, nkan meji.
Come on, sit down.	Wa, joko.
I have never been to a doctor.	Emi ko tii lọ si dokita.
He was very friendly.	O jẹ ọrẹ pupọ.
You've got a great job.	O ti ni iṣẹ nla kan.
This will not work.	Eyi kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
Please, you have to believe me now.	Jọwọ, o ni lati gbagbọ mi ni bayi.
We just are.	A kan jẹ.
He was left, as we thought, on board.	A fi i silẹ, bi a ti ro, lori ọkọ.
We are still working.	A tun n ṣiṣẹ.
Maybe thoughtful people made their trouble.	Boya awọn eniyan ti o ni ero ṣe wahala wọn.
This can go both ways, though.	Eyi le lọ awọn ọna mejeeji, paapaa.
She found her favorite chair and sat down.	O ri ijoko ayanfẹ rẹ o si joko.
He was with a woman.	O si wà pẹlu obinrin kan.
And he was wrong.	Ati pe o ṣe aṣiṣe.
Until my birthday.	Titi ojo ibi mi.
When all the other students had finished, he spoke.	Nigbati gbogbo awọn ọmọ ile-iwe miiran ti pari, o sọrọ.
Several systems can be employed here.	Awọn ọna ṣiṣe pupọ le wa ni iṣẹ nibi.
Please remember to turn off the lights when you leave.	Jọwọ ranti lati yipada si pa awọn ina nigbati o ba lọ kuro.
No one could expect me to have to prove myself to them.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o le reti pe emi ni lati fi ara mi han fun wọn.
My driver will take you to and from school.	Awakọ mi yoo mu ọ lọ si ati lati ile-iwe.
I do not know where I started.	Emi ko mọ ibiti mo ti bẹrẹ.
He worked long hours.	O ṣiṣẹ awọn wakati pipẹ.
You need to explain.	O nilo lati ṣe alaye.
Everyone is tired.	Gbogbo eniyan ti re.
There were so many.	Nibẹ wà ki ọpọlọpọ.
And you know you have a chance.	Ati pe o mọ pe o ni anfani.
Leave your hands there for at least three minutes.	Fi ọwọ rẹ silẹ nibẹ fun o kere iṣẹju mẹta.
You can't believe it.	O ko le gbagbọ.
Proceed as planned.	Tẹsiwaju bi a ti pinnu.
And they will sound good, too.	Ati pe wọn yoo dun dara, paapaa.
He hates any kind of music.	O korira eyikeyi iru orin.
But it was, and it will be.	Ṣugbọn o wà, ati awọn ti o yoo jẹ.
I decided to write down some of them.	Mo pinnu lati kọ diẹ ninu wọn silẹ.
That's not good.	Iyẹn ko dara.
But it was his decision.	Ṣugbọn ipinnu rẹ ni.
It will not last long.	O yoo ko duro fun gun.
They can try.	Wọn le gbiyanju.
So what.	Njẹ kini.
So, why not just for us.	Nitorina, kilode ti kii ṣe fun wa nikan.
More information is needed about both conditions.	Alaye diẹ sii ni a nilo nipa awọn ipo mejeeji.
You do not need to do this, he said.	O ko nilo lati ṣe eyi, o sọ.
Old enough to do it yourself.	Atijọ to lati ṣe funrararẹ.
Up to this point.	Titi di aaye yii.
Do it publicly.	Ṣe o ni gbangba.
I did the same and it worked well.	Mo ti ṣe kanna ati ki o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
Your request was rejected.	A kọ ibeere rẹ.
People are not the only things to work on.	Eniyan kii ṣe awọn nkan lati ṣiṣẹ nikan lori.
I hope you will come back one day.	Mo nireti pe iwọ yoo pada si ọjọ kan.
We are finished.	A ti pari.
It was only to be expected.	O je nikan lati wa ni o ti ṣe yẹ.
It is not an easy thing to do.	Kii ṣe ohun ti o rọrun lati ṣe.
It is important to read, read and read again.	O ṣe pataki lati ka, ka ati ka lẹẹkansi.
Because, you think, this is life.	Nitori, o ro pe, eyi ni igbesi aye.
You can not decide whether or not to take it off.	O ko le pinnu boya tabi kii ṣe lati mu kuro.
He wants to do everything.	O fe lati se ohun gbogbo.
Not sure what the problem is.	Ko daju kini iṣoro naa.
And hear this.	Ati ki o gbọ eyi.
You can change it as you wish.	O le yipada bi o ṣe fẹ.
He has been waiting since morning.	O ti n duro de lati owurọ.
I will fill in my sister's name.	Emi yoo kun orukọ arabinrin mi.
Your decision is final here.	Ipinnu rẹ jẹ ipari nibi.
I look at my watch.	Mo wo aago mi.
They are here for hours.	Wọn wa nibi fun awọn wakati.
I think they get it.	Mo ro pe wọn gba rẹ.
At this point it must be in the body.	Ni akoko yii o gbọdọ wa ninu ara.
I am not the one they want.	Emi kii ṣe ẹni ti wọn fẹ.
She left soon after her baby was born.	O lọ ni kete lẹhin ti a bi ọmọ rẹ.
Look at these little things not too small.	Wo awọn nkan kekere wọnyi ko kere pupọ.
Want one to see this.	Fẹ ọkan wa lati ri eyi.
But it is more than that.	Ṣugbọn o ju iyẹn lọ.
We talk about that.	A sọrọ nipa iyẹn.
Our driver told me it happens all the time.	Awakọ wa sọ fun mi pe o ṣẹlẹ nigbagbogbo.
I'm very happy.	Inu mi kan dun.
It is used to run things.	O ti lo lati ṣiṣe awọn nkan.
We were all in a small room, we slept together.	Gbogbo wa wa ninu yara kekere kan, a sun papọ.
So here too.	Nitorina nibi paapaa.
I have thought about it.	Mo ti ro nipa re.
I hope this is a simple mistake.	Mo nireti pe eyi jẹ aṣiṣe ti o rọrun.
There was no question at that time.	Ko ṣe ibeere kankan ni akoko yẹn.
History has taught men many lessons.	Itan ti kọ awọn ọkunrin ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹkọ.
I know what you want to ask.	Mo mọ ohun ti o fẹ lati beere.
You must go, my friend.	O gbọdọ lọ, ọrẹ mi.
We haven't seen much else yet.	A ko tii ri pupọ miiran sibẹsibẹ.
What happens when we lose them ?.	Kini yoo ṣẹlẹ nigbati a ba padanu wọn ?.
Can't remember.	Ko le ranti.
That is possible, he decided.	Iyẹn ṣee ṣe, o pinnu.
It is impossible to know where we are now.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati mọ ibiti a wa ni bayi.
He poured some water into a cup of tea.	O da omi diẹ sinu ife tii kan.
He was not angry as such, he was anxious.	O ko binu bi iru bẹẹ, o ni aniyan.
I don't know why it's happening.	Emi ko mọ idi ti o fi n ṣẹlẹ.
I started to fly.	Mo bẹrẹ lati fo.
They look at me.	Won wo mi.
They look at each other face to face.	Won wo ara won oju si oju.
What used to take several hours now takes a few minutes.	Ohun ti o lo lati gba awọn wakati pupọ ni bayi gba iṣẹju diẹ.
She's knocking on the door.	O n ti ilẹkun.
She laughed at what she said.	O rẹrin ni nkan ti o sọ.
Great way to start at the end.	Ọna nla lati bẹrẹ ni ipari.
Time is running out and tomorrow is another day.	Akoko n lọ ati ọla jẹ ọjọ miiran.
That is very important.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki pupọ.
I know you will be happy.	Mo mọ pe inu rẹ yoo dun.
Repeat books to write.	Tun awọn iwe lati kọ.
I am happy with it.	Inu mi dun pẹlu rẹ.
I do not like the situation.	Emi ko fẹran ipo naa.
This happens from time to time and nothing is always there.	Eyi n ṣẹlẹ lati igba de igba ati pe ko si nkan ti o wa nigbagbogbo.
Let's start again.	Jẹ ká bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
Think before you speak.	Ronu ṣaaju ki o to sọrọ.
That is a lot.	Iyẹn jẹ pupọ.
I don’t think you can get a little easier than that.	Emi ko ro pe o le gba diẹ rọrun ju ti.
State the reasons for your request.	Sọ awọn idi fun ibeere rẹ.
We are here for you.	A wa nibi fun ọ.
Take time, but not too much time.	Gba akoko, ṣugbọn kii ṣe akoko pupọ.
At least he didn't have to say the words.	O kere ju ko ni lati sọ awọn ọrọ naa.
They continue.	Wọn tẹsiwaju.
This is a mistake.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
Your car is working, as it is always driving.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ ti ṣe iṣẹ, bi o ti n wakọ nigbagbogbo.
Please drop these off.	Jọwọ gbe awọn wọnyi silẹ daradara.
Hard to know what to believe.	Gidigidi lati mọ kini lati gbagbọ.
Or a bed.	Tabi ibusun kan.
Most summers are very hot.	Pupọ julọ awọn igba ooru ni o gbona pupọ.
He hit again, again, again.	O lu lẹẹkansi, lẹẹkansi, lẹẹkansi.
Let it get personal.	Jẹ ki o gba ti ara ẹni.
I don't understand the new question either.	Emi ko loye ibeere tuntun boya boya.
To say anything.	Lati sọ ohunkohun.
They will travel by plane.	Wọn yoo rin nipasẹ ọkọ ofurufu.
I think that is key, of course.	Mo ro pe iyẹn jẹ bọtini, ni idaniloju.
We live here now and we need help.	A n gbe nibi bayi ati pe a nilo iranlọwọ.
We will try to explain.	A yoo gbiyanju lati ṣe alaye.
Time to go.	Akoko lati lọ.
And it costs a lot of money.	Ati pe o ni owo pupọ pupọ.
It is the first thing.	O jẹ ohun akọkọ.
People have been arrested in the past year.	A ti mu awọn eniyan iyalẹnu ni ọdun ti tẹlẹ.
That's for sure.	Iyẹn daju.
It just won’t happen.	O kan kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
It’s the best thing ever.	O jẹ ohun ti o dara julọ lailai.
And that sounds good.	Ati pe iyẹn dun.
I meet up with friends and make new ones.	Mo pade pẹlu awọn ọrẹ ati ṣe awọn tuntun.
With how much he has been working lately, he is worried.	Pẹlu bi o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ lọwọ laipẹ, o ṣe aniyan.
John says he is leaving town tomorrow.	John sọ pe oun n lọ kuro ni ilu ni ọla.
I do not see them.	Emi ko ri wọn.
One is the small backyards.	Ọkan jẹ awọn ile kekere ẹhin.
Don't be, don't be.	Maṣe di, maṣe di.
Are you not in an accident?	Ṣe o ko wa ninu ijamba?
Cars for buses.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ fun awọn ọkọ akero.
Now someone came along saying we had to change.	Bayi ẹnikan wa pẹlu sọ pe a ni lati yipada.
See this.	Wo eyi.
No love there either.	Ko si ife nibẹ boya.
This is great.	Eyi ni nla.
No problem, we say.	Ko si iṣoro, a sọ.
She looks like my wife.	O dabi iyawo mi.
Some people are working hard to make themselves look better.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan n ṣiṣẹ lọwọ lati sọ ara wọn di eniyan ti o dara julọ.
But there is a way to this.	Ṣugbọn ọna kan wa si eyi.
It should not happen.	Ko yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
I did a great job.	Mo ṣe iṣẹ nla kan.
You can stay here or go home or whatever.	O le duro nibi tabi lọ si ile tabi ohunkohun ti.
Read the whole article.	Ṣe gbogbo ọrọ ka.
It is impossible to say why.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati sọ idi.
Pay them off.	San wọn kuro.
He did not know what to say.	Ko mọ ohun ti yoo sọ.
It may not be to some.	O le ma jẹ si diẹ ninu awọn.
You don’t need to be harder than that.	Ko nilo lati ni lile ju iyẹn lọ.
But they are small.	Ṣugbọn wọn kere.
They have tried to kill him by force.	Wọn ti gbiyanju lati pa a nipasẹ iṣẹ.
I have not forgotten that idea.	Emi ko gbagbe imọran yẹn.
He will not have one of it.	Oun yoo ko ni ọkan ninu rẹ.
It is good to be able to get out of it.	O dara lati ni anfani lati lọ kuro ninu rẹ.
If you are sleeping, go back to sleep.	Ti o ba n sun, o pada si sun.
The sister had not seen her father for about a week.	Arabinrin naa ko tii ri baba rẹ fun bii ọsẹ kan.
This is only one city.	Eyi jẹ ilu kan nikan.
I would love it, whatever people say.	Emi yoo fẹ rẹ, ohunkohun ti eniyan sọ.
No time can be spared.	A ko le da akoko kankan si.
Or pass here.	Tabi kọja nibi.
And always to try to do that.	Ati nigbagbogbo lati gbiyanju lati ṣe iyẹn.
Two ways to do it.	Awọn ọna meji lati ṣe.
Your story is impossible, and you doubt it.	Itan rẹ ko ṣee ṣe, o si ṣiyemeji.
He hesitated for a minute.	O ṣiyemeji fun iṣẹju kan.
I was there to take care of the children.	Mo wa nibẹ lati tọju awọn ọmọde.
She looked around, her students full.	O wo ni ayika rẹ, awọn ọmọ ile-iwe rẹ ti kun.
Or so you think.	Tabi ki o ro.
We just want to keep feeling that amazing.	A kan fẹ lati tọju rilara ti iyalẹnu yẹn.
He hopes it is.	O nireti pe o jẹ.
Can't remember.	Ko le ranti.
I just get out of everything.	Mo kan kuro ninu ohun gbogbo.
It is possible.	A ṣee ṣe.
I have no other way to reach him.	Emi ko ni ọna miiran lati de ọdọ rẹ.
You know, it’s some of both.	O mọ, o jẹ diẹ ninu awọn mejeeji.
My brother is very tall.	Arakunrin mi ga pupo.
I was not the same, nor was it.	Emi ko je kanna, tabi ti o wà.
We look forward to the rain this season.	A nireti fun ojo ni akoko yii.
Someone was sitting on his face.	Ẹnikan ti joko lori oju rẹ.
Even big ones like this.	Paapaa awọn nla bii eyi.
And what is this? 	Ati kini eleyi?
he asked.	o beere.
In fact, it is amazing.	Ni otitọ, o jẹ iyanu.
He said he had dropped out of school.	O sọ pe o ti fi silẹ ni ile-iwe.
I have already said.	Mo ti sọ tẹlẹ.
They deserve to be more.	Wọn yẹ lati jẹ diẹ sii.
Just stand there, pull them up and not notice.	O kan duro nibẹ, o fa wọn soke ko si ṣe akiyesi.
The boy's face changed.	Oju ọmọkunrin naa yipada.
See you.	Wo o.
The art world is open.	Aye aworan ti ṣii.
This obviously does not work.	Eyi han gbangba ko ṣiṣẹ.
I think this is a great idea.	Mo ro pe eyi jẹ imọran nla.
Yours or yours.	Tirẹ tabi tirẹ.
I do not even know how.	Emi ko paapaa mọ bawo.
I'm just going to listen.	Mo kan lilọ lati gbọ.
But, of course, he was young.	Ṣugbọn, dajudaju, o jẹ ọdọ.
I do not want to go to the doctor for a while.	Emi ko fẹ lati lọ si dokita fun igba diẹ.
I have never heard back from them.	Emi ko tii gbọ pada lati ọdọ wọn.
He is my father.	Baba mi ni.
But that is not the point.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe aaye naa.
I know you know about us.	Mo mọ pe o mọ nipa wa.
We live football.	A n gbe bọọlu.
I hope you like them.	Mo nireti pe o fẹran wọn.
The day will be warm.	Ọjọ naa yoo gbona.
This will not happen.	Eyi kii yoo ṣe.
Stop thinking home celebrations will work.	Duro lati ronu pe awọn ayẹyẹ ile yoo ṣiṣẹ.
Maybe with time it will go away.	Boya pẹlu akoko o yoo lọ kuro.
The girls hurried to class.	Awọn ọmọbirin n yara lọ si kilasi.
It may not mean much.	O le ma tumọ si pupọ.
None of this has been tested.	Ko si ọkan ninu eyi ti o ti ṣe idanwo.

There are several possible systems.	Awọn ọna ṣiṣe ti o ṣeeṣe pupọ wa.
And we are able to do a lot of things for people.	Ati pe a ni anfani lati ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun fun awọn eniyan.
That would be your advice.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ imọran rẹ.
This is a mistake, in your opinion.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe, ninu ero rẹ.
It's a big city.	Ilu nla ni.
That is the whole problem.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo iṣoro naa.
Most people like it.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan fẹran rẹ.
The family man is nothing.	Eniyan ebi ko je nkankan.
It is completely open.	O ti ṣii patapata.
I wouldn’t have anything like that.	Emi kii yoo ni ohunkohun bi iyẹn.
You know what you want in life.	O mọ ohun ti o fẹ ninu aye.
He was angry about it.	O binu nipa rẹ.
Try to remember the last time you bought something.	Gbiyanju lati ranti awọn ti o kẹhin akoko ti o ra nkankan.

Thus he entered the way.	Bayi ni o wọ ọna naa.
No one knows.	Ẹnikan ko mọ.

So, "what for dinner?" 	Nitorina, "kini fun ounjẹ alẹ?"
he asked.	o beere.
We will buy books, and we will accept that we may need help.	A yoo ra awọn iwe, ati pe a yoo gba pe a le nilo iranlọwọ.
Not as they decided to play.	Kii ṣe bii wọn ṣe pinnu lati mu ṣiṣẹ.
Open dinner only.	Ṣii ounjẹ alẹ nikan.
And that makes it very important.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ ki o ṣe pataki pupọ.

Something thought.	Nkankan ro pa.
It was a matter of work, my father.	O jẹ nkan ti iṣẹ, baba mi.
In making that question, he was making a statement.	Ni ṣiṣe ibeere yẹn, o n ṣe alaye kan.
But eyes.	Ṣugbọn oju.
Some of the best stories are told in verse.	Diẹ ninu awọn itan ti o dara julọ ni a sọ ni ẹsẹ.

Depending on the game, you may need a lot more.	Ti o da lori ere, o le nilo pupọ diẹ.

Many more only slightly hurt the friends brought home.	Ọpọlọpọ diẹ sii nikan ni ipalara diẹ ni awọn ọrẹ mu lọ si ile.
If you are saying the same things, you are in agreement.	Ti o ba n sọ awọn nkan kanna, o wa ni adehun.
This problem is, of course, not new.	Iṣoro yii jẹ, dajudaju, kii ṣe tuntun.

Is that yours or that of your mother?	Ṣe tirẹ ni iyẹn tabi ti iya rẹ?

It also improved its own well.	O tun dara si ti ara rẹ daradara.
You are in error because an error occurred.	O wa ninu aṣiṣe nitori aṣiṣe kan ti ṣẹlẹ.
Here is what will happen.	Eyi ni ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.

Maybe that is the reason.	Boya idi niyen.
I am from the city	Mo wa lati ilu
However, there are questions.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ibeere wa.
No one can do any better under these conditions.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o le ṣe eyikeyi ti o dara julọ labẹ awọn ipo.
He was only in the office when it happened.	O wa nikan ni ọfiisi nigbati o ṣẹlẹ.
Is that too much to ask ?.	Ṣe iyẹn pupọ lati beere?.
It is a good explanation.	O jẹ alaye to dara.
He kept it inside and continued.	O tọju rẹ si inu o si tẹsiwaju.
It makes us love each other.	O jẹ ki a nifẹ si ara wa.
But don’t just take our word for it.	Ṣugbọn maṣe gba ọrọ wa nikan.
There you must go.	Nibẹ ni o gbọdọ lọ.

The station is full.	Ibudo naa ti kun.
They sell a lot of musical instruments.	Wọn ta ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun elo orin.
In a year, maybe two, we will all forget it.	Ni ọdun kan, boya meji, a yoo gbagbe gbogbo rẹ.
I love these people so much.	Mo nifẹ awọn eniyan wọnyi pupọ.
Maybe nothing to find out.	Boya ko si nkankan lati wa jade.
Man, you are beautiful.	Eniyan, o lẹwa.
We found it in place.	A rii pe o wa ni aaye.
Day in, day out.	Ọjọ ni, ọjọ jade.

Too much to be wrong, in fact.	Pupọ pupọ lati jẹ aṣiṣe, ni otitọ.

I spoke to them today about the situation.	Mo ti ba wọn sọrọ loni nipa ipo naa.
They killed them.	Wọn pa wọn.
With us, you will never make a mistake.	Pẹlu wa, iwọ kii yoo ṣe aṣiṣe rara.
Nothing special.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣe pataki.
It takes us all together and behind each other.	O gba gbogbo wa papọ ati lẹhin ara wa.
It's everything you ever wanted a woman to be.	O ni ohun gbogbo ti o lailai fe a obinrin lati wa ni.
He knew what he could do to his father.	O mọ ohun ti o le ṣe si baba rẹ.
His clothes are broken.	Aṣọ rẹ̀ ti fọ́.
Most of us are not.	Pupọ ninu wa kii ṣe.
Words stop.	Awọn ọrọ duro.
One such situation is the dog of the vehicle.	Ọkan iru ipo ni aja ti ọkọ.
The future is in our hands.	Ojo iwaju wa ni ọwọ wa.
It may be that you are already working on these.	O le jẹ pe o ti n ṣiṣẹ tẹlẹ lori awọn.
Okay, at least he won’t start at this point.	O dara, o kere ju oun kii yoo bẹrẹ ni akoko yii.
But he knew it would pass.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe yoo kọja.
Stop all the time.	Duro ni gbogbo igba.
That obviously is only true power.	Iyẹn han gbangba pe agbara otitọ nikan ni.
Her mother was in a car accident.	Iya rẹ wa ninu ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
At first you just want to be and be friends.	Ni akọkọ o kan fẹ lati wa ati jẹ ọrẹ.
You better be with me.	O dara julọ ki o wa pẹlu mi.
Rules made.	Awọn ofin ti a ṣe.
They think you should want to give them this gift.	Wọn ro pe o yẹ ki o fẹ lati fun wọn ni ẹbun yii.
Obviously something is wrong.	O han ni nkankan ti ko tọ.
Just leave me for now.	Kan fi mi silẹ fun bayi.
Winter is coming.	Igba otutu n bọ.
Several cars parked outside the building.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ pupọ duro ni ita ile naa.

It had not rained for two weeks.	Ojo ko ti ro ni ọsẹ meji.
There are many problems.	Awọn iṣoro pupọ lo wa.
But not there.	Ṣugbọn ko si nibẹ.
Every month.	Ni gbogbo oṣu kan.
It feels good.	O ro dara.
Maybe you can clean them up a bit.	Boya o le nu wọn soke diẹ.
Only that is not all true.	Nikan iyẹn kii ṣe gbogbo otitọ.
He will have more life.	Oun yoo ni aye diẹ.
Get a seat in one of the test rooms.	Gba ijoko ni ọkan ninu awọn yara idanwo.
They bought that for themselves.	Wọn ra iyẹn funrararẹ.
That is for us.	Iyẹn ni fun wa.
They will always expect me at home.	Wọn yoo ma reti mi ni ile.
Maybe tonight you want to light a fire.	Boya ni alẹ oni o fẹ ṣe ina.
They cannot change.	Wọn ko le yipada.
You have to die for that.	O ni lati ku fun iyẹn.
I don't need friends anymore.	Emi ko nilo awọn ọrẹ mọ.
I ask you to accept them for what they are, your children.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ lati gba wọn fun ohun ti wọn jẹ, awọn ọmọ rẹ.
Fortunately, you want to change everything to your advantage.	O da, o fẹ yi ohun gbogbo si anfani rẹ.
But, no one knows what will happen.	Ṣugbọn, ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
We accept this.	A gba eleyi.
Want to pick one.	Fẹ lati gbe ọkan.
Can't remember his name.	Ko le ranti orukọ rẹ.
So, what can we do?	Nitorina, kini a le ṣe?
That is very important to me.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki pupọ fun mi.
Meet me at the bar on vacation.	Pade mi ni igi ni isinmi.
He really felt that things with him were going well.	O ti ro gaan pe awọn nkan pẹlu rẹ ti n lọ daradara daradara.
This city is full of history.	Ilu yi ti kun ninu itan.
I'm glad I read it.	Inu mi dun pe mo ti ka a.
He grew up very much.	O dagba pupọ.
It is very difficult to write, but it can be done.	O nira pupọ lati kọ, ṣugbọn o le ṣee ṣe.
I want to know everything about it.	Mo fe lati mọ ohun gbogbo nipa rẹ.
And they don’t like it when you take them.	Ati pe wọn ko fẹran rẹ nigbati o ya wọn.
Holding my hand he used to tell me stories.	Di ọwọ mi mu o lo lati sọ awọn itan fun mi.
Go ahead and hurry.	Tẹsiwaju ki o yara.
Please hear me out.	Jọwọ gbọ mi jade.
Do not for a minute.	Maṣe fun iṣẹju kan.
But even that is good.	Ṣugbọn paapaa iyẹn dara.
I can't wait to see them.	Emi ko le duro lati ri wọn.
The police are waiting to see you.	Awọn ọlọpa n reti lati ri ọ.
You do not have to say until you want to say.	O ko ni lati sọ titi ti o ba fẹ sọ.
It can happen to anyone.	O le ṣẹlẹ si ẹnikẹni.
History is not on his side.	Itan ko si ni ẹgbẹ rẹ.
There are some shops nearby.	Awọn ile itaja kan wa nitosi.
I can not go through this again.	Emi ko le lọ nipasẹ yi lẹẹkansi.
It was nothing but a sure thing.	O je ohunkohun sugbon kan daju ohun.
Suggestions alone will not help.	Awọn imọran nikan kii yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.
But that cannot last forever.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko le duro lailai.
He hopes to work for the office.	O nireti lati ṣiṣẹ fun ọfiisi.
The old days.	Awọn ọjọ atijọ.
The days of his power are over.	Awọn ọjọ ti agbara rẹ ti pari.
Man kills his mother.	Eniyan pa iya rẹ.
And something is better than nothing.	Ati pe nkan kan dara ju ohunkohun lọ.
It will not come again.	Kii yoo tun wa.
You may have walked back that way.	O le ti rin pada si ọna yẹn.
You need to help.	O nilo lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
Sometimes, they may have very good information.	Nigba miiran, wọn le ni alaye ti o dara pupọ.
He did not carry it.	Ko gbe e.
There is no way to keep that.	Ko si ọna lati pa iyẹn.
You've talked about it before.	O ti sọrọ nipa rẹ tẹlẹ.
All methods obtained as of.	Gbogbo awọn ọna gba bi ti.
He was already a doctor.	O jẹ dokita tẹlẹ.
Not at all important, but good if possible.	Ko ṣe pataki patapata, ṣugbọn dara ti o ba ṣeeṣe.
He had never seen her before and never saw her again.	Ko ri i tẹlẹ ati pe ko ri i mọ.
Maybe they should give us a longer rest.	Boya wọn yẹ ki o fun wa ni isinmi to gun.
I am beyond my story and behind me.	Mo ju itan mi lọ ati lẹhin mi.
They will not work.	Wọn kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
He does not know.	Oun ko mọ.
But if it is our home, our children, whatever.	Ṣugbọn ti o ba jẹ ile wa, awọn ọmọ wa, ohunkohun ti.
That is something he loves so much.	Ohun ti o nifẹ pupọ niyẹn.
In my pocket.	Ninu apo mi.
We are not interested in that.	A ko nifẹ ninu iyẹn.
I get why they want to.	Mo gba idi ti wọn fẹ.
My father couldn’t either, and he was in it.	Baba mi ko le boya, o si wa ninu rẹ.
I have said this for many years.	Mo ti sọ eyi fun ọdun pupọ.
The program is new and beautiful.	Eto naa jẹ tuntun ati lẹwa.
Which is not clear.	Eyi ti ko si ni gbangba.
About reports of a fire in the building.	Nipa awọn iroyin ti ina kan ninu ile naa.
I love you and will always love you.	Mo nifẹ rẹ ati pe yoo nifẹ rẹ nigbagbogbo.
You know how important this is.	O mọ bi eyi ṣe ṣe pataki to.
Just beautiful.	O kan lẹwa.
That is a very bad idea.	Iyẹn jẹ ero buburu pupọ.
We spent the afternoon talking and laughing.	A lo ọsan a sọrọ ati rẹrin.
This book is hard to read.	Iwe yi jẹ gidigidi lati ka.
We went to the store.	A lọ si ile itaja.
It should have been washed.	O yẹ ki a ti fo.
But nothing.	Sugbon ko si nkankan.
If not, wait until you do.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, duro titi o fi ṣe.
Together you have made a new life.	Papọ o ti ṣe igbesi aye tuntun.
This year has not come.	Odun yi ko de.
You need to stop the games.	O nilo lati da awọn ere duro.
The truth is no one knows.	Otitọ ni ko si ẹniti o mọ.
I want to bring it back to that.	Mo fẹ mu pada si iyẹn.
But this time you know that you are reading your thoughts carefully.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yii o mọ pe o n ka awọn ero rẹ daradara.
She helps and prepares dinner for everyone.	O ṣe iranlọwọ ati ṣe ounjẹ alẹ fun gbogbo eniyan.
And if you want, your dad can stay here.	Ati pe ti o ba fẹ, baba rẹ le duro nibi.
And it seemed really good.	O si dabi enipe gan dara.
I did not notice this at first.	Emi ko ṣe akiyesi eyi ni akọkọ.
Have more of that.	Ni diẹ sii ni iyẹn.
Advice given.	Imọran ti o fun.
I could be used more.	Mo le ṣee lo diẹ sii.
She turned to see what was wrong.	O yipada lati wo kini aṣiṣe.
And nothing.	Ati pe ko si ohun.
The water of the world itself.	Omi ti aye funrararẹ.
We ended up doing our own thing.	A pari ṣiṣe awọn ohun ti ara wa.
We believe at first.	A gbagbọ ni akọkọ.
And you can stop what’s going to happen.	Ati pe o le da ohun ti n fẹrẹ ṣẹlẹ.
He was a good friend.	O jẹ ọrẹ to dara.
They are not determined to remain forever.	Wọn ko pinnu lati wa titi lailai.
Live for them there.	Gbe fun wọn nibẹ.
But not sure.	Sugbon ko daju.
He would have contacted me if he could.	Oun yoo ti kan si mi ti o ba le.
Lots of gifts.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹbun.
The girls are happy, sure.	Awọn ọmọbirin naa dun, daju.
You know he's here.	O mọ pe o wa nibi.
They did this first.	Wọn ṣe eyi ni akọkọ.
If they have, you hope to leave.	Ti wọn ba ni, o nireti lati fi silẹ.
I would ask those questions.	Emi yoo beere awọn ibeere naa.
And he shut the door behind him.	O si ti ilẹkun lẹhin rẹ.
But they won’t do that, either.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii yoo ṣe iyẹn, boya.
More tests need to be done. 	Awọn idanwo diẹ sii nilo lati ṣe. 
Men's.	awọn ọkunrin.
That’s about what they’ll get.	Iyẹn jẹ nipa ohun ti wọn yoo gba.
There may be a place for you to sleep.	Ibi kan le wa fun ọ lati sun.
They get them to school through exams.	Wọn gba wọn si ile-iwe nipasẹ idanwo.
I stood behind him.	Mo duro lẹhin rẹ.
He was on it.	O si wà lori rẹ.
It is possible that they will understand something.	O ṣee ṣe pe wọn yoo ni oye nkankan.
I wonder where it came from.	Mo Iyanu ibi ti o ti wa.
No, not just on it.	Rara, kii ṣe lori rẹ nikan.
There is nothing about that.	Ko si nkankan nipa iyẹn.
It looks like you need one.	O dabi pe o nilo ọkan.
To tell me when my family found out.	Lati so fun mi nigbati ebi mi ri jade.
However, many others are not so sure.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran ko ni idaniloju bẹ.
As in a way, will.	Bi ni ọna kan, yoo.
The man who knew him.	Ọkunrin ti o mọ ọ.
To be completely is not what we are looking for.	Lati jẹ patapata kii ṣe ohun ti a n wa.
He didn't seem to want to hear the truth.	O dabi pe ko fẹ gbọ otitọ.
And such.	Ati iru.
I could be a better one.	Mo le jẹ ọkan ti o dara.
For a moment, he held her hand.	Fun igba diẹ, o di ọwọ rẹ mu.
Now everything works fine.	Bayi ohun gbogbo ṣiṣẹ daradara.
They can be noticed more if anyone likes it.	Wọn le ṣe akiyesi diẹ ti ẹnikẹni ba fẹran rẹ.
They seemed to have a problem with the cars.	O dabi enipe wọn ni iṣoro pẹlu awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
And that's fine.	Ati pe iyẹn dara.
But no one really knows, because the method is new.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ gaan, nitori ọna naa jẹ tuntun.
They are not supposed to do this.	Wọn ko yẹ lati ṣe eyi.
Maybe he was afraid to see what was in it.	Boya o bẹru lati wo ohun ti o wa ninu.
You could not have been born this way.	O ko le ti bi ni ọna yi.
I think a lot about the future, our future.	Mo ronu pupọ nipa ọjọ iwaju, ọjọ iwaju wa.
Bad days are what make us stronger.	Awọn ọjọ buburu jẹ ohun ti o jẹ ki a ni okun sii.
That is not the case.	Iyẹn ko ri bẹẹ.
Things out of hand.	Ohun ti jade ti ọwọ.
Either way, those.	Ọna boya, awon.
Read and celebrate.	Ka o si ṣe ayẹyẹ.
I should have been fast.	Mo yẹ ki o ti sare.
It does not matter what the facts are.	Ko ṣe pataki kini awọn otitọ jẹ.
With a body.	Pẹlu ara kan.
But you can lock the door on it.	Ṣugbọn o le ti ilẹkun lori rẹ.
You heard something else.	O tun gbọ ohun miiran.
I know there may be other things.	Mo mọ pe awọn nkan miiran le wa.
It only shakes my head.	O mi ori nikan.
But that's not why people buy them.	Ṣugbọn ti o ni ko idi ti awon eniyan ra wọn.
But, that is not the point.	Ṣugbọn, iyẹn kii ṣe aaye naa.
Not a problem at all.	Kii ṣe iṣoro rara.
Again, be as informative as you can be.	Lẹẹkansi, jẹ alaye bi o ti le ṣe.
Thus, three questions.	Bayi, ibeere mẹta.
You are looking for yourself.	O n wa ara rẹ.
My teachers have been great.	Awọn olukọ mi ti jẹ pupọ.
And they can only benefit.	Ati pe wọn nikan le ni anfani.
There are few people who enjoy swimming.	Awọn eniyan diẹ wa ti o gbadun odo.
I ask you.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ.
It should not be a problem for them.	Ko yẹ ki o jẹ iṣoro fun wọn.
And he did really well, too.	O si ṣe gan daradara, ju.
But too sweet.	Sugbon ju dun.
At least not on purpose.	O kere kii ṣe lori idi.
I would need such help.	Emi yoo nilo iranlọwọ bẹ.
His parents did not think he would be too much in anything.	Awọn obi rẹ ko ro pe oun yoo jẹ pupọ ninu ohunkohun.
It’s in it, right now.	O wa ninu rẹ, ni bayi.
Some of their own people were sold.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ti ara wọn ni wọn ta.
Some of my people know about it.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan mi mọ nipa rẹ.
It doesn't seem like a big deal.	Ko dabi ẹni pe ohun nla kan.
I am not like my husband.	Emi ko dabi ọkọ mi.
He made a face and looked down.	O ṣe oju kan o si wo isalẹ.
The road crosses a path of small houses.	Opopona kọja ọna kan ti awọn ile kekere.
It helps if you know they are coming.	O ṣe iranlọwọ ti o ba mọ pe wọn n bọ.
It all has to come out.	Gbogbo rẹ ni lati jade.
I turned it off.	Mo ti pa a kuro.
I also want one.	Mo tun fẹ ọkan.
Be on your way.	Wa lori ọna rẹ.
Both already know each other.	Awọn mejeeji ti mọ ara wọn tẹlẹ.
It's too small.	O jẹ kekere pupọ.
I don’t mean to surprise you.	Emi ko tumọ lati ṣe iyanu fun ọ.
We must die as we should.	A gbọdọ ku bi o ṣe yẹ.
It might be better for me.	O le dara julọ fun mi.
However here it is, let it happen.	Sibẹsibẹ nibi o wa, jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
It's getting late.	O ti n pẹ.
You should be able to sit a lot of people.	O yẹ ki o ni anfani lati joko ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
But okay with me.	Ṣugbọn dara pẹlu mi.
You should have.	O yẹ ki o ni.
I have a bad background.	Mo ni kan buburu lẹhin.
Here is the song that helped me.	Eyi ni orin ti o ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi.
And into music.	Ati sinu orin.
It can't be too.	Ko le ju.
They have more to expect.	Wọn ni diẹ lati nireti.
It takes about three hours to reach the venue.	O gba to wakati mẹta lati de ibi ipade naa.
And how to never drink again.	Ati bi o ṣe le ma ṣe mu lẹẹkansi.
He was forced to work in a store.	O fi agbara mu lati ṣiṣẹ ni ile itaja kan.
I don’t think it means to be, but it is.	Emi ko ro pe o tumọ si lati wa, ṣugbọn o jẹ.
I never talked to anyone.	Emi ko sọrọ si ẹnikẹni.
He was sitting in the bus.	O joko ninu ọkọ akero naa.
For too long.	Fun gun ju.
I told him his face changed.	Mo sọ fun u pe oju rẹ yipada.
I haven't seen him in a long time.	Emi ko tii ri i fun igba pipẹ.
It's out of hand.	O ti n jade ti ọwọ.
As in many other things.	Bi ninu ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun miiran.
It doesn't make much sense to me.	Ko ṣe oye pupọ si mi.
We will not be here forever.	A ko ni wa nibi lailai.
I waited for the story, but nothing came of it.	Mo duro de itan naa, ṣugbọn ko si nkan ti o wa.
But it was also something.	Sugbon o tun je nkankan.
He taught himself to read and write.	O kọ ara rẹ lati ka ati kọ.
He was trying to look inside my head, nothing more.	O n gbiyanju lati wo inu ori mi, ko si nkankan mọ.
This is a story coming together.	Eyi jẹ itan ti o nbọ papọ.
It could be wrong, of course.	O le jẹ aṣiṣe, dajudaju.
We just work.	A kan ṣiṣẹ.
Here’s how it goes.	Eyi ni bi o ti n lọ.
Anything can be food.	Ohunkohun le jẹ ounjẹ.
Or others.	Tabi awọn miiran.
Do we accept, without question.	Ṣe a gba, laisi ibeere.
Whatever it is.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ.
Not married, either.	Ko ti ni iyawo, boya.
We must do the right thing.	A gbọdọ ṣe nkan ti o tọ.
So he thought.	Nitorina o ro.
It could be the other way around.	O le jẹ ọna miiran.
He was not alone in his room.	Oun nikan ko si ninu yara rẹ.
Just drop it.	O kan ju silẹ rẹ.
I learned that power only works at night, however.	Mo kọ ẹkọ pe agbara nikan ṣiṣẹ ni alẹ, sibẹsibẹ.
Now.	Ni bayi.
That will come in handy.	Iyẹn yoo wa ni ọwọ gaan.
It is better to take it at the station.	O dara ki o mu u ni ibudo naa.
You will be completely new.	Iwọ yoo jẹ tuntun patapata.
Here is the advice behind it.	Eyi ni imọran lẹhin rẹ.
There has been a car accident.	Ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan ti wa.
My parents did.	Awọn obi mi ṣe.
If you ever need me, give me anything.	Ti o ba nilo mi lailai, fun ohunkohun.
He hopes to get a good rest.	O nireti lati gba awọn isinmi to dara.
I spent some time making friends with her daughter.	Mo lo akoko diẹ lati ṣe awọn ọrẹ pẹlu ọmọbirin rẹ.
They are not everything.	Wọn kii ṣe ohun gbogbo.
I can't go back down.	Emi ko le pada si isalẹ.
For the last time.	Fun igba ikẹhin.
I look forward to those days too.	Mo nireti si awọn ọjọ yẹn paapaa.
he asked.	o beere.
Everyone will stop.	Gbogbo eniyan yoo duro.
It is our job to be that way.	O jẹ iṣẹ wa lati jẹ iyẹn.
Mo kuro even.	Mo kuro paapaa.
It's my sister, she thought.	Arabinrin mi ni, o ro.
He hit both hands down on the table.	O lu ọwọ mejeeji si isalẹ lori tabili.
Let them know it happened.	Jẹ ki wọn mọ pe o ṣẹlẹ.
That is great work.	Ise nla niyen.
I'm calling you something.	Mo n pe e ni nkan.
My wife wants me to clean it.	Iyawo fe mi lati nu o.
She looked behind him.	O wo lẹhin rẹ.
You can't hear well now.	O ko le gbọ daradara bayi.
We found ourselves in more than we thought.	A rii pe wa ni diẹ sii ju bi a ti ro lọ.
That can be hard to understand.	Iyẹn le jẹ gidigidi lati ni oye.
In fact she does not look like a woman anymore.	Ni otitọ ko dabi obinrin mọ.
He went to school every morning and night.	O si lọ si ile-iwe ni gbogbo owurọ ati alẹ.
I think you can handle what we were about.	Mo ro pe o le mu ohun ti a wà nipa.
It can be hot in it.	O le gbona ninu rẹ.
Either way, they are dead.	Ọna boya, wọn ti ku.
We are not anyone anymore.	A kii ṣe ẹnikẹni mọ.
You have not decided to say so.	O ko ti pinnu lati sọ bẹ.
When he spoke again, his tone changed.	Nigbati o tun sọrọ, ohun orin rẹ ti yipada.
We have to do it now.	A ni lati ṣe ni bayi.
You have to win over the one you lost.	O ni lati gun lori ọkan ti o padanu.
You can bring this.	Iwọ ni o le mu eyi wa.
Your story is long.	Itan rẹ jẹ pipẹ.
He refused to talk to me.	O kọ lati ba mi sọrọ.
What class or year is it.	Kini kilasi tabi ọdun ti o wa.
I am not one of those people.	Emi ko jẹ ọkan ninu awọn eniyan yẹn.
He lived for a while.	O gbe fun igba diẹ.
So good enough.	Nitorina o dara to.
He did not miss any time.	Ko padanu akoko kankan.
They came home.	Won de ile.
A lot already.	Pupo ti tẹlẹ.
That's what got into it.	Ohun ti o wọ inu rẹ niyẹn.
He will always love me.	Oun yoo nifẹ mi nigbagbogbo.
They have talked about it a lot.	Wọn ti sọrọ nipa rẹ pupọ.
Something legal, something important.	Nkankan labẹ ofin, nkan pataki.
This is more a matter.	Eyi jẹ ọrọ diẹ sii.
He has not seen such power since.	Oun ko tii ri iru agbara bẹẹ lati igba naa.
Or more.	Tabi pupọ.
You don’t want them to play like this.	O ko fẹ ki wọn mu bi eleyi.
This year more than ever.	Odun yi ju lailai.
I plan to do the same thing.	Mo n gbero lati ṣe ohun kanna.
But with you, me, me.	Ṣugbọn pẹlu rẹ, mi, mi.
It is power.	Agbara ni.
Not for anyone.	Ko fun enikeni.
This was the happiest day of my life.	Eyi jẹ ọjọ ti o dun julọ ni igbesi aye mi.
I think you know what you believe and write.	Mo ro pe o mọ ohun ti o gbagbọ ati kọ.
To continue.	Lati tẹsiwaju.
You don’t know with me.	O ko mọ pẹlu mi.
I remember it well now.	Mo ranti rẹ daradara bayi.
In class.	Ni kilasi.
We can not see.	A ko le ri.
A few days passed.	Awọn ọjọ diẹ kọja.
Of course, they have rejected me.	Dajudaju, wọn ti kọ mi silẹ.
Can't get enough.	Ko le gba to.
I will consider your opinion.	Emi yoo ro ero rẹ.
He opened the box of breakfast.	O ṣii apoti ti ounjẹ owurọ.
Of course he has regained his composure.	Dajudaju o ti gba agbara rẹ pada.
Over and over and over.	Lori ati lori ati lori.
Just go here.	Kan lọ si ibi.
He was tired of waiting and went away.	O ti rẹ lati duro o si lọ.
It will take a lot of time to handle that.	Yoo ni akoko pupọ lati mu iyẹn.
One of the longest.	Ọkan ninu awọn to gun.
He hopes that will not be a problem.	O nireti pe iyẹn kii yoo di iṣoro.
It won’t come to that, he thought.	Kii yoo wa si iyẹn, o ro.
But this is not your story.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe itan rẹ.
So it worked out.	Nitorina o ṣiṣẹ jade.
So if you don’t have friends, be friends.	Nitorina ti o ko ba ni ọrẹ, jẹ ọrẹ.
I like them very much.	Mo fẹran wọn pupọ.
This was hard to say.	Eleyi je gidigidi lati sọ.
I'll let it happen.	Emi yoo jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
So he hit me hard.	Nitorina o lu mi ni lile.
It has not changed.	Ko ti yipada.
Most importantly, do you enjoy what you are doing?	Ni pataki julọ, ṣe o gbadun ohun ti o n ṣe?
Is there some understanding here ?.	Njẹ oye diẹ wa nibi?.
It’s a story you give them.	O jẹ itan ti o fun wọn.
Your head is gone.	Ori rẹ ti lọ.
But they have no plans of their own.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko ni eto ti ara wọn.
Going through something like that is hard.	Lilọ nipasẹ nkan bii iyẹn jẹ lile.
Heat over low heat until hot.	Ooru lori kekere ooru kan titi ti o fi gbona.
I hope you are good at your new job.	Mo nireti pe o dara ni iṣẹ tuntun rẹ.
It is not very easy to sell a stolen car.	Ko rọrun pupọ lati ta ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti ji.
He did everything for them.	O ṣe ohun gbogbo fun wọn.
And it killed me.	Ati pe o pa mi.
Can't find it.	Ko le ri.
These people lived in the past.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi n gbe ni igba atijọ.
But it is not, of course.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe, dajudaju.
You will be able to stay in it.	Iwọ yoo ni anfani lati duro ninu rẹ.
Things will stop.	Awọn nkan yoo da.
And when the game was made, we loved it.	Ati nigbati a ṣe ere naa, a nifẹ rẹ.
You know the way and it will get you.	O mọ ọna ati pe yoo gba ọ.
On the big word of the day.	Lori ọrọ nla ti ọjọ naa.
I do not like this strange thing.	Emi ko fẹran nkan iyalẹnu yii.
It’s been going on since time immemorial.	O ti n lọ lati igba ti akoko ti bẹrẹ.
Love my life.	Ife aye mi.
We told one thing about the news.	A sọ ọkan wa nipa awọn iroyin.
I also had trouble talking to him about anything important.	Mo tun ni wahala lati ba a sọrọ nipa ohunkohun ti o ṣe pataki.
Sorry to hear about your injury.	Ma binu lati gbọ nipa ipalara rẹ.
They happen, but not always.	Wọn ṣẹlẹ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe nigbagbogbo.
You have to play with what you have.	O ni lati mu ṣiṣẹ pẹlu ohun ti o ni.
I don’t know how it got on.	Emi ko mo bi o ti gba lori.
You need something better.	O nilo nkan to dara julọ.
Not surprisingly.	Kii ṣe iyalẹnu.
This is the way we hope to be around.	Eyi ni ọna ti a nireti lati wa ni ayika.
Hold your hand.	Di ọwọ rẹ.
You have a job, you see.	O ni iṣẹ kan, o rii.
They are called special sites here.	A pe wọn ni awọn aaye iṣẹ pataki nibi.
In a ball.	Ninu bọọlu kan.
A few words and a gift usually say it all.	Awọn ọrọ diẹ ati ẹbun maa n sọ gbogbo rẹ.
So they would not have met.	Nitorina wọn kii yoo ti pade.
It may take a long time, or not at all.	O le gba igba pipẹ, tabi rara.
We are all one.	Ọkan ni gbogbo wa.
Must be.	O ni lati jẹ.
Have watched me for a long time.	Ti wo mi fun igba pipẹ.
Frequently asked questions.	Ibeere nigbagbogbo beere.
I may have died.	Mo le ti ku.

They can start again.	Wọn le bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
Man what to see and know best.	Eniyan kini lati rii ati mọ ti o dara julọ.
Maybe he lost his job.	Boya o padanu iṣẹ rẹ.
He has trouble speaking.	O ni iṣoro lati sọrọ.
You can try this yourself.	O le gbiyanju eyi funrararẹ.
They do not believe it.	Wọn ko gbagbọ rẹ.
She tried to hide, but could not.	O gbiyanju lati tọju, ṣugbọn ko le.
Or something.	Tabi ohun kan.
It is better to stay behind.	O dara ki o duro sẹhin.
Give your word or words to you.	Ṣe fun ọrọ rẹ tabi awọn ọrọ si ọ.
But he used to.	Sugbon o lo lati.
And that might just work.	Ati pe iyẹn le kan ṣiṣẹ.
Many boys always help him.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọkunrin nigbagbogbo ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
And neither his mother nor his father nor his brother.	Ati bẹni iya rẹ tabi baba rẹ tabi arakunrin rẹ.
From those who know.	Lati awọn ti o mọ.
At least that’s how you feel.	O kere ju pe o jẹ bi o ṣe lero.
I got up.	Mo ti dide.
Love your site.	Nifẹ aaye rẹ.
See, why not leave now.	Wo, kilode ti o ko fi silẹ ni bayi.
It is not a big house.	Kii ṣe ile nla kan.
But anything is possible.	Ṣugbọn ohunkohun ṣee ṣe.
Very good for me.	O dara pupọ fun mi.
They hear things from home.	Wọn gbọ ohun lati ile.
The letters became.	Awọn lẹta naa di.
Find a job.	Wa iṣẹ kan.
It is your tone beyond words.	O jẹ ohun orin rẹ ju awọn ọrọ lọ.
It is not the first time and it will not be the last.	Kii ṣe igba akọkọ ati pe kii yoo jẹ ikẹhin.
Just after lunch.	O kan lẹhin ounjẹ ọsan.
Do you enjoy walking on the beach?	Ṣe o gbadun rin lori eti okun?
It should be on the bed.	O yẹ ki o wa lori ibusun.
The work took longer than we expected.	Iṣẹ naa gba to gun ju ti a ti ṣe yẹ lọ.
Thoughts, sure.	Awọn ero, daju.
If it is anything, it is more.	Ti o ba jẹ ohunkohun, o jẹ diẹ sii.
I do not feel myself.	Emi ko lero ara mi.
I recently returned from a trip back home.	Laipẹ mo pada lati irin-ajo kan pada si ile.
And there is nothing better.	Ko si ni ohun ti o dara julọ.
If you leave now, the woman will be alone.	Ti o ba lọ kuro ni bayi, obinrin naa yoo wa nikan.
It grows smaller as it grows.	O dagba kere si bi o ti n dagba.
I can’t leave them there.	Emi ko le fi wọn silẹ nibẹ.
About both of us, in fact.	Nipa awọn mejeeji wa, ni otitọ.
Please come soon.	Jọwọ laipẹ laipẹ.
To live, you must eat.	Lati gbe, o gbọdọ jẹun.
He's not really into it.	O si ni ko gan sinu o.
It was me.	O je mi.
I live.	Mo gbe.
But we cannot make a fixed law about them.	Ṣugbọn a ko le ṣe ofin ti o wa titi nipa wọn.
He slept through the last leg of their journey.	O sun nipasẹ ẹsẹ ikẹhin ti irin-ajo wọn.
Sit down, and listen up.	Joko, ki o si gbọ soke.
I do not belong to you.	Emi kii ṣe tirẹ.
If you draw to it.	Ti o ba fa si rẹ.
Everyone knows this is not possible.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ pe eyi ko ṣee ṣe.
We have to talk.	A ni lati sọrọ.
Let me tell you something.	Jẹ ki n sọ nkan diẹ fun ọ.
It is easy to use.	O rọrun lati lo.
It could not have been better.	Ko le ti dara.
Please contact me if you have any.	Jọwọ tọ mi ti o ba ni nkankan.
Depending on what you mean.	Da lori ohun ti o tumọ si.
I do not want to see.	Nko fe wo.
This is a good meal.	Eleyi jẹ kan dara ounjẹ.
I'll be watching.	Emi yoo ma wo.
While talking on the phone.	Nigba ti a ti sọrọ lori foonu.
If left alone, the kitten will begin to walk again.	Ti o ba fi silẹ nikan, ọmọ ologbo yoo bẹrẹ si rin lẹẹkansi.
We used three planes to explore the area.	A lo awọn ọkọ ofurufu mẹta lati wa agbegbe naa.
And that’s what you have to keep to one.	Ati pe iyẹn ni ohun ti o ni lati tọju si ọkan.
My old friend is right.	Ọrẹ mi atijọ ti tọ.
I always seem to do this.	Mo nigbagbogbo dabi lati ṣe eyi.
The same people every day in this place.	Awọn eniyan kanna ni gbogbo ọjọ ni ibi yii.
The accident happened last year.	Ijamba naa ṣẹlẹ ni ọdun to kọja.
More than ever.	Diẹ sii ju nigbagbogbo.
He was here last year.	O wa nibi ni ọdun to kọja.
He looked at the small boat.	O wo ọkọ oju omi kekere naa.
But no one appeared.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o han.
It will be hot.	O ma gbona.
These clothes are made of metal.	Awọn aṣọ wọnyi jẹ irin.
So they did it again and again.	Nitorina wọn tun ṣe lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
Can you give me a minute?	Ṣe o le fun mi ni iṣẹju kan?
Today is one of those days.	Loni jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọjọ yẹn.
These are also included.	Awọn wọnyi tun wa pẹlu.
Go ahead, and eat as much as you like.	Tẹsiwaju, ki o jẹun bi o ṣe fẹ.
I love good clothes.	Mo nifẹ awọn aṣọ to dara.
It would be if you meant you could stop me.	Yoo jẹ ti o ba tumọ si pe o le da mi duro.
The past is not the future.	Awọn ti o ti kọja ni ko ojo iwaju.
This should tell us something.	Eyi yẹ ki o sọ fun wa nkankan.
He picked me up.	O ti gbe mi.
We can help each other but a little.	A le ran ara wa lọwọ ṣugbọn diẹ.
You will be a special man.	Iwọ yoo jẹ ọkunrin pataki.
Water filled up.	Omi ti a ti kun soke.
But it is a good place to start.	Sugbon o jẹ ibi ti o dara lati bẹrẹ.
He did not know what to say.	Ko mọ kini lati sọ.
And my dad is one.	Ati baba mi jẹ ọkan.
Good one.	Ọkan ti o dara.
Something bad.	Nkankan buburu.
We found out he would be a boy.	A rii pe yoo jẹ ọmọkunrin.
They are there.	Wọn wa ni aaye naa.
But he will remember all this.	Ṣugbọn oun yoo ranti gbogbo eyi.
I do not know what this means.	Emi ko mọ kini eyi tumọ si.
I want to be with myself.	Mo fẹ lati wa pẹlu ti ara mi.
We talked, but nothing happened.	A sọrọ, ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
All that matters is that you have.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni pe o ni.
Where should we sit?	Nibo ni o yẹ ki a joko?
Here are your problems.	Eyi ni awọn iṣoro tirẹ.
He was old enough to be the father of the child.	O ti dagba to lati jẹ baba ọmọ naa.
I will give him much.	Emi yoo fun u ni Elo.
My students will make sure it passes.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe mi yoo rii daju pe o kọja.
I would be happy to do it this way.	Inu mi yoo dun lati ṣe ni ọna yii.
I want to see you.	Mo fe ri e wa.
He could not believe it.	Ko le gbagbọ.
I always do.	Mo ṣe nigbagbogbo.
It would just be nice.	O kan yoo dara.
He told me, his voice in the ear, to put it back.	O sọ fun mi, ohun rẹ ni eti, lati fi pada.
No other work is required to work.	Ko nilo iṣẹ miiran lati ṣiṣẹ.
Homemade food is always wanted.	Ounjẹ ti a se ni ile ni a fẹ nigbagbogbo.
I have enough money.	Mo ti ni owo to.
No one will take you away.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo mu ọ lọ.
He made me a cup of tea.	O da ife tii kan fun mi.
He could not even see his brother.	Ko le paapaa wo arakunrin rẹ.
Sorry to see me let it out.	Ma binu ri mi ti o jẹ ki o jade.
It's a big room.	Yara nla ni.
What are your other three days.	Kini awọn ọjọ mẹta rẹ miiran.
That should not happen.	Iyẹn ko yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
But let time work for you, rather than work for time.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki akoko ṣiṣẹ fun ọ, ju ki o ṣiṣẹ fun akoko.
I think there is a small problem.	Mo ro pe iṣoro kekere kan wa.
She only lives in a small house.	O ngbe nikan ni ile kekere kan.
Just enough to treat me well, he said.	O kan to lati tọju mi ​​daradara, o sọ.
One of his run.	Ọkan ninu rẹ ṣiṣe.
If we close our ears, we will not hear.	Ti a ba pa eti wa, a ko ni gbọ.
We have three children.	A ni awọn ọmọde mẹta.
Here it is.	Nibi o wa.
Remember the last city.	Ranti ilu ti o kẹhin.
I cause this.	Mo fa eyi.
I think it could be both.	Mo ro pe o le jẹ mejeeji.
Problems can arise from that fact.	Awọn iṣoro le dide lati otitọ yẹn.
You love me, too.	O feran mi, ju.
But this is not the point here.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe aaye nibi.
They do.	Wọn ṣe.
It just doesn't work.	O kan ko ṣiṣẹ.
Her little eyes were serious and hard.	Oju kekere rẹ ṣe pataki ati lile.
I spent some time there.	Mo ti lo diẹ ninu awọn akoko nibẹ.
A few minutes in another world.	Awọn iṣẹju diẹ ni aye miiran.
Neither happened here.	Bẹni ko ṣẹlẹ nibi.
Maybe you go get help or.	Boya o lọ gba iranlọwọ tabi.
You know the thing.	O mọ ohun naa.
That sounds weird, but it's not a bad one at all.	Iyẹn jẹ rilara iyalẹnu, ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọkan buburu patapata.
That was the case before this happened.	Iyẹn jẹ ọrọ ṣaaju ki eyi to ṣẹlẹ.
Not a bad city once you get to know it.	Ko kan buburu ilu ni kete ti o gba lati mọ ti o.
Don’t get up about it.	Maṣe gba soke nipa rẹ.
It belongs to her mother.	O jẹ ti iya rẹ.
It will not work for my child or me.	Kii yoo ṣiṣẹ fun ọmọ mi tabi emi.
The sister was angry.	Arabinrin naa binu.
What a great find.	Ohun ti a nla ri.
I do not want the day to end.	Emi ko fẹ ki ọjọ naa pari.
We do not charge a fee.	A ko gba owo mimu kan rara.
He thinks he is good at work, good at games.	O ro pe o dara ni iṣẹ, o dara ni awọn ere.
Take it with you.	Mu kuro pẹlu rẹ.
I have found and it is also good for me.	Mo ti rii ati pe o tun dara si mi.
And it was great.	O si dara julọ.
It was a great time for music.	O jẹ akoko nla fun orin.
No injuries.	Ko si awọn ipalara.
Her mother is as beautiful as ever.	Iya rẹ lẹwa bi lailai.
But he did not like me.	Sugbon ko feran mi.
Make no mistake about it.	Maṣe ṣe aṣiṣe yẹn.
Do not say or do anything.	Maṣe sọ tabi ṣe ohunkohun.
It’s worth wanting to see again.	O tọ lati fẹ lati ri lẹẹkansi.
Stop doing that.	Duro ṣiṣe bẹ.
They will not last long.	Wọn kii yoo pẹ.
If someone helps, they help.	Ti ẹnikan ba ṣe iranlọwọ, wọn ṣe iranlọwọ.
And my brother.	Ati arakunrin mi.
There are no plans.	Ko si eto.
I want to make that money.	Mo fẹ lati ṣe owo yẹn.
Can't wait now.	Ko le duro ni bayi.
Many of them have killed someone.	Ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn ti pa ẹnikan.
Some men do not like it.	Awọn ọkunrin kan ko fẹran rẹ.
I do outside.	Mo ṣe ni ita.
My family could not believe it.	Idile mi ko le gbagbọ.
Nothing will not work.	Ko si ohun ti ko ni ṣe.
All children are special and wonderful.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọde jẹ pataki ati iyanu.
I should tell you something.	Mo yẹ ki o sọ nkankan fun ọ.
It's too tight.	O ti le ju.
I do not know if you can do this.	Emi ko mọ pe o le ṣe eyi.
The work is almost complete.	Iṣẹ naa ti fẹrẹ pari.
It is not beyond the realm of understanding.	Ko kọja aaye oye.
I received your letter.	Mo gba lẹta rẹ.
This is where it should be.	Eyi ni ibiti o ti yẹ ki o wa.
I almost always agree with your ideas.	Mo fẹrẹ gba nigbagbogbo pẹlu awọn ero rẹ.
He will not be that person.	Oun kii yoo jẹ ẹni yẹn.
Like nothing has really changed.	Bi ohunkohun ti gan yi pada.
See pictures again.	Wo awọn aworan lẹẹkansi.
I know what you mean.	Mo mọ ohun ti o tumọ si.
We should do this regularly.	A yẹ ki o ṣe eyi nigbagbogbo.
There are no men of any kind, or women.	Ko si awọn ọkunrin ti eyikeyi iru, tabi obinrin.
Good for my back.	Dara fun ẹhin mi.
I look at it, look away.	Mo wo e, wo kuro.
Make a purchase for me.	Ṣe ifẹ si mi.
I tried that way but could not.	Mo gbiyanju ni ọna yẹn ṣugbọn ko le ṣe.
But this is not how it should be.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe bi o ṣe yẹ.
But they left.	Ṣugbọn wọn fi silẹ niyẹn.

He tried to move, but when he tried nothing happened.	O gbiyanju lati gbe, ṣugbọn nigbati o gbiyanju ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
At my mother's side.	Ni ẹgbẹ iya mi.
They are not given here.	A ko fun wọn nibi.
Just there do your thing.	O kan wa nibẹ ṣe ohun rẹ.
I look at their faces.	Mo wo oju wọn.
And they are very strong and they need help.	Ati pe wọn ni agbara pupọ ati pe wọn fẹ iranlọwọ.
A scared child.	Ọmọde ti o bẹru.
Don’t run around.	Maṣe sare ni ayika.
I do not mean that in a bad way.	Emi ko tumọ si iyẹn ni ọna buburu.
For some reason.	Fun idi kan.
They know each other, they are together.	Wọn mọ ara wọn, wọn wa papọ.
I know you have.	Mo mọ pe o ni.
Why would he do such a thing.	Kini idi ti yoo ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ.
I think it just might work.	Mo ro pe o kan le ṣiṣẹ.
And that was the last.	Ati awọn ti o wà kẹhin.
We are all trying to work for the same purpose.	Gbogbo wa n gbiyanju lati ṣiṣẹ fun idi kanna.
Is anything happening?	Njẹ ohunkohun n ṣẹlẹ?
They go out and everyone goes with them.	Wọn jade ati gbogbo eniyan lọ pẹlu wọn.
You would expect it to just be there.	O yoo reti o kan wa nibẹ.
He was alone in the room at that time.	Oun nikan wa ninu yara ni akoko yẹn.
Two new friends you made today.	Awọn ọrẹ tuntun meji ti o ṣe loni.
He has died long, right now.	O ti ku gun, ni bayi.
However, you need to know your watch.	Sibẹsibẹ, o nilo lati mọ aago rẹ.
All his friends are in the city.	Gbogbo awọn ọrẹ rẹ wa ni ilu naa.
You have to arrive at work.	O ni lati de ibi iṣẹ.
I will only say this.	Emi yoo sọ eyi nikan.
I have books to write.	Mo ni awọn iwe lati kọ.
You are not aware of your life.	O wa ko mọ ti aye rẹ.
I agree with you there.	Mo gba pẹlu rẹ nibẹ.
I left there for weeks.	Mo fi silẹ nibẹ fun awọn ọsẹ.
Not a bad job as jobs go.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ buburu bi awọn iṣẹ ṣe lọ.
But that life is behind me.	Ṣugbọn igbesi aye yẹn wa lẹhin mi.
And if we go outside, they will find us.	Ati pe ti a ba jade ni ita, wọn yoo wa wa.
He is not himself.	Oun kii ṣe funrararẹ.
Not only young people brought to the streets.	Ko nikan odo awon eniyan mu si ita.
I'm very sorry.	Ma binu gidigidi.
What time is it now?	Kini akoko bayi?
At this point, however, we need to stop and think again.	Ni aaye yii, sibẹsibẹ, a nilo lati da duro ki o tun ronu.
It was amazing to me.	O je iyanu fun mi.
I know and understand how they feel.	Mo mọ ati oye bi wọn ṣe lero.
The hand is finished, and it never lets go.	Ọwọ naa ti pari, ati pe ko tun jẹ ki o lọ.
Put the kids on it.	Fi awọn ọmọ lori rẹ.
This book will help you learn to cook.	Iwe yii yoo ran ọ lọwọ lati kọ ẹkọ lati ṣe ounjẹ.
We can't do that yet.	A ko le ṣe iyẹn sibẹsibẹ.
I invite you to climb this mountain.	Mo pe o lati gun oke yi.
I say as it is.	Mo sọ bi o ti jẹ.
But he knew there was no place to go about it.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe ko si aaye lati tẹsiwaju nipa rẹ.
That’s the way it has to be.	Iyẹn ni ọna ti o ni lati jẹ.
He took her home.	O si mu u ile.
They got up early today.	Won dide ni kutukutu loni.
Don't go overboard.	Maṣe kọja rẹ.
Are any outside.	Ti wa ni eyikeyi ita.
Dead eyes.	Awon oju ti o ku.
I know from yourself.	Mo ti mọ lati ara rẹ.
Everyone can see that.	Gbogbo eniyan le rii iyẹn.
There is a lot of stress around that.	Nibẹ ni a pupo ti wahala ni ayika ti.
She went to the store to buy dinner.	O lọ si ile itaja lati ra ounjẹ alẹ.
Just tell me which one you like.	Kan so fun mi eyi ti o fẹ.
For all of us, and with you.	Fun gbogbo wa, ati pe pẹlu rẹ.
He told me that of course it could help.	O sọ fun mi pe dajudaju o le ṣe iranlọwọ.
Let me see that.	Jẹ ki n rii iyẹn.
It was a bad baby move.	O je kan buburu ọmọ Gbe.
Contact us today.	Kan si wa loni.
You are running as fast as you can.	O ti n sare nikan bi o ti le.
Civil service is excellent.	Iṣẹ ilu ni dara julọ.
Try to be one of those people.	Gbiyanju lati jẹ ọkan ninu awọn eniyan naa.
It's a good one.	O dara kan.
Leave the car.	Fi ọkọ silẹ.
It's more than a car.	O ju ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ lọ.
No, it is not.	Rara kii ṣe bẹ.
However no one is known less.	Sibẹsibẹ ti ko si ọkan ti a mọ kere.
And we are still here.	Ati pe a tun wa nibi.
The reason for this is simple.	Idi fun eyi rọrun.
I see the error below.	Mo wo aṣiṣe ti o wa ni isalẹ.
Nothing and no one.	Ko si nkankan ati ko si ọkan.
At one point he made his breakfast.	Ni akoko kan o ṣe ounjẹ owurọ rẹ.
The important thing is the money is gone.	Ohun pataki ni owo naa ti kọja.
I don’t want to give in, you see.	Emi ko fẹ lati fun ni, o ri.
You have to let it work.	O ni lati jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
Please get their help and a new place to live.	Jọwọ gba iranlọwọ wọn ati aaye tuntun lati gbe.
Two years without a friend.	Ọdun meji ti ko ni ọrẹ kan.
I hate that word because we don’t.	Mo korira ọrọ yẹn nitori a ko.
And a piece of advice.	Ati nkan ti imọran.
You can even go out.	O le paapaa jade.
He has two brothers.	O ni arakunrin meji.
There is not much that can be done about this problem.	Ko si pupọ ti o le ṣee ṣe nipa iṣoro yii.
I understood what he was saying to me even before he said it.	Mo loye ohun ti o n sọ fun mi paapaa ṣaaju ki o to sọ.
It’s also hard to believe he’s gone.	O tun nira lati gbagbọ pe o ti lọ.
It was clean, at least.	O je mọ, ni o kere.
It is not one that is difficult to find.	Kii ṣe ọkan ti o nira lati rii.
Okay, you know, everyone is doing.	O dara, o mọ, gbogbo eniyan n ṣe.
You have to accept.	O ni lati gba.
It should be legal.	O yẹ ki o jẹ ofin.
Raise heat to high.	Gbe ooru soke si giga.
I have never been late or lost a job already.	Emi ko pẹ tabi padanu iṣẹ tẹlẹ.
I do not believe them at all.	Emi ko gbagbọ wọn rara.
He was a front man who told a story.	O jẹ ọkunrin iwaju ti o sọ itan kan.
Hold on to yourself as you hold on to love.	Di ara rẹ mu ninu ifẹ bi a ṣe di ọ mu ninu ifẹ.
This explains the wonder.	Eyi ṣe alaye iyanu naa.
Of how to keep your home.	Ti bi o lati tọju rẹ ile.
There are.	Nibẹ ni o wa.
It sounds like a lot of people that way.	O dabi ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni ọna yẹn.
This is true here, too.	Eyi jẹ otitọ nibi, paapaa.
A few words are left.	Awọn ọrọ diẹ ni o ku.
Some children believe they can fly.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọde gbagbọ pe wọn le fo.
Maybe we will.	Boya a kii yoo.
He did his job well.	O ṣe awọn iṣẹ rẹ daradara.
Okay, here goes for bed.	O dara, nibi lọ fun ibusun.
It's time for her to start making better decisions.	O to akoko fun u lati bẹrẹ ṣiṣe awọn ipinnu to dara julọ.
I went to find it.	Mo ti lọ lati wa rẹ.
We can get more like them.	A le gba diẹ sii bii wọn.
They can stay just like that there.	Wọn le duro bi iyẹn nikan nibẹ.
The trip took two weeks.	Irin-ajo naa gba ọsẹ meji.
Try hard.	Gbiyanju gidigidi.
There is more, however.	Nibẹ ni diẹ, sibẹsibẹ.
Something made me do it.	Nkankan mu mi ṣe bẹ.
All you have to do is take off your clothes.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ni lati ṣe ni yọ aṣọ rẹ kuro.
Nothing special about.	Ko si ohun pataki nipa.
But you should learn from it.	Ṣugbọn o yẹ ki o kọ ẹkọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
The group continues to travel.	Ẹgbẹ naa tẹsiwaju lati rin irin-ajo.
You feel it.	O rilara rẹ.
I, too, could not believe this!	Emi naa, ko le gbagbọ eyi!
What you have tried to do.	Ohun ti o ti gbiyanju lati se.
After that, he was asking me to do even more.	Lẹhin iyẹn, o ti n beere lọwọ mi lati ṣe paapaa.
Going up.	Ti lọ si oke.
They must be watered regularly.	Wọn gbọdọ wa ni omi nigbagbogbo.
Run out of hot water while taking a shower.	Ṣiṣe jade ninu omi gbona nigba ti o mu iwe.
I know you mean me.	Mo mọ pe o tumọ si mi.
Now the money is gone.	Bayi ni owo ti pari.
I don’t even do that kind of thing anymore.	Emi ko paapaa ṣe iru nkan yẹn mọ.
There is good news for young people.	Awọn iroyin ti o dara wa fun awọn ọdọ.
He hit my brother in the leg.	O lu arakunrin mi ni ẹsẹ.
He killed himself making me think about what he was looking for.	O pa ara rẹ jẹ ki n ronu nipa ohun ti o n wa.
I do not know what else to say.	Emi ko mọ kini ohun miiran lati sọ.
I'm thinking about it this morning.	Mo n ronu nipa rẹ ni owurọ yii.
I do not know how to do this.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe eyi.
Few of any will know.	Diẹ ti eyikeyi yoo mọ.
This did not give me any problems.	Eyi ko fun mi ni awọn iṣoro kankan.
You have nothing to fear from me.	O ko ni nkankan lati bẹru lati ọdọ mi.
My mother touched my head.	Iya mi kan mi ori.
Which is to say a good thing.	Eyi ti o jẹ lati sọ kan ti o dara.
The city is a place of houses where people live.	Ilu jẹ aaye ti o ni awọn ile ti awọn eniyan n gbe.
But here it is important.	Ṣugbọn nibi o ṣe pataki.
I do not feel at all.	Emi ko rilara rara.
I am not in love with her.	Emi ko ni ife pẹlu rẹ.
Life takes time.	Igbesi aye gba akoko.
I think that is the most appropriate thing to do.	Mo ro pe iyẹn ni ohun ti o yẹ julọ lati ṣe.
I had lunch with him a month ago.	Mo jẹ ounjẹ ọsan pẹlu rẹ ni oṣu kan sẹhin.
In fact, you know.	Ni otitọ, o mọ.
This is what it takes to be a father.	Eyi ni ohun ti o jẹ lati jẹ baba.
And when we bought our old mansion.	Ati pe nigba ti a ra ile nla wa atijọ.
Maybe we are making a mistake.	Boya a n ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
He walked with the purpose of the room.	O rin pẹlu idi inu yara naa.
Some people are walking away.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan n rin kuro.
I plan to do these every week.	Mo gbero lati ṣe awọn wọnyi ni gbogbo ọsẹ.
Everyone plays games.	Gbogbo eniyan ṣe awọn ere.
The children are scared.	Awọn ọmọ bẹru.
We are talking about art, friend.	A n sọrọ nipa aworan, ọrẹ.
That is not new.	Iyẹn kii ṣe tuntun.
She has a dog with her.	O ni aja kan pẹlu rẹ.
Too much is not to be taken lightly.	Pupọ julọ kii ṣe lati mu bi otitọ.
It all works well together to help children understand.	Gbogbo rẹ ṣiṣẹ papọ daradara lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun awọn ọmọde ni oye.
I am here for a reason.	Mo wa nibi fun idi kan.
He could not really believe he was dead.	Ko le gbagbọ gaan pe o ti ku.
She is very happy.	Inu re dun pupo.
Making the city work is no small task.	Mimu ki ilu ṣiṣẹ kii ṣe iṣẹ kekere.
You will see that we can get some.	Iwọ yoo rii pe a le gba diẹ ninu ọkan.
Everyone can see everyone else.	Gbogbo eniyan le rii gbogbo eniyan miiran.
I love the team.	Mo nifẹ ẹgbẹ naa.
It is impossible for the truth to keep forever.	Ko ṣee ṣe fun otitọ lati tọju lailai.
No, we can not help you.	Rara, a ko le ran ọ lọwọ.
The truth on the road to this place should be taken.	Otitọ ni opopona si ibi yii yẹ ki o gba.
This is so beautiful.	Eleyi jẹ ki lẹwa.
I am going up to my room.	Mo n lọ soke si yara mi.
Such devices are fine.	Iru awọn ẹrọ jẹ daradara.
That's better.	Iyẹn dara ju.
I just read, of course.	Mo ti ka nikan, dajudaju.
That is for you to do.	Iyẹn jẹ fun ọ lati ṣe.
People decide where they want to live.	Awọn eniyan ṣe ipinnu nipa ibi ti wọn fẹ lati gbe.
Another drink for the road?	Ohun mimu miiran fun opopona?
He put it in his hand.	O fi si ọwọ rẹ.
They think it's time we talked.	Wọn ro pe o to akoko ti a sọrọ.
Still was, if you want to know.	Ṣi wà, ti o ba ti o ba fẹ lati mọ.
There are several doors.	Awọn ilẹkun pupọ wa.
I know such a man.	Mo mọ iru ọkunrin kan.
I have two questions.	Mo ni ibeere meji.
I have never done this before.	Emi ko tii ṣe iru eyi tẹlẹ.
I do not like the way you look at me.	Nko feran bi o se n wo mi.
We waited for several minutes.	A duro fun ọpọlọpọ awọn iṣẹju.
And that was informative.	Ati awọn ti o wà alaye.
Sooner or later, people will come to get me.	Laipẹ tabi ya, awọn eniyan yoo wa gba mi.
And that takes money.	Ati pe iyẹn gba owo.
I have done so.	Mo ti ṣe bẹ.
When do we expect to start?	Nigbawo ni a nireti lati bẹrẹ?
I am looking for a good place for us.	Mo n wa ibi ti o dara fun wa.
Can we give up on that ?.	Njẹ a le fi silẹ ni iyẹn?.
I do not suspect at all.	Nko fura rara rara.
You can talk your way in or out of anything.	O le sọrọ ọna rẹ sinu tabi jade ti ohunkohun.
I just got them back, you know.	Mo kan gba wọn pada, o mọ.
But we will come to understand it.	Ṣugbọn a yoo wa lati loye rẹ.
No money there.	Ko si owo nibẹ.
I do not want to.	Nko fe.
But all in all it was a great stay.	Sugbon gbogbo ni gbogbo awọn ti o je kan nla duro.
But he looks up.	Ṣugbọn o n wo soke.
Now we are on to something.	Bayi a wa lori nkan kan.
Everything they do is for people to see them.	Gbogbo ohun ti wọn ṣe ni fun eniyan lati rii wọn.
Let it show itself.	Jẹ ki o fi ara rẹ han.
But with everything he said, it was a hard word.	Ṣugbọn pẹlu gbogbo nkan ti o sọ, o jẹ ọrọ lile.
Sorry to your parents.	Binu si awọn obi rẹ.
Tell them with your eyes that you like meeting them.	Sọ fun wọn pẹlu oju rẹ pe o fẹran ipade pẹlu wọn.
No one even spoke.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọrọ paapaa.
Over the years, perhaps.	Ni awọn ọdun, boya.
In some worlds,	Ni diẹ ninu awọn aye,
That should have happened years ago.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ ni awọn ọdun sẹhin.
Better than that.	Dara ju eyi lọ.
He wrote important information.	O kọ alaye pataki.
A le mu.	A le mu.
And why it should !.	Ati idi ti o yẹ!.
It's easy to do something.	O rọrun lati ṣe nkan.
I want to swim more.	Mo fẹ lati we diẹ sii.
There is nothing you can do.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe.
Both of their parents are doctors.	Awọn mejeeji ti awọn obi wọn jẹ dokita.
One thing is for sure.	Ohun kan daju.
They all have to drink.	Gbogbo wọn ni lati mu.
Find out what happened to him.	Wa ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si i.
It was placed by people outside.	Awọn eniyan ti o wa ni ita ni wọn gbe e si.
It should be in a.	O yẹ ki o jẹ ninu a.
Everyone came through.	Gbogbo eniyan wa nipasẹ.
It’s not just about me.	Kii ṣe nipa mi nikan.
I don’t hear you happy about anything.	Emi ko gbọ inu rẹ dun nipa ohunkohun.
I look back.	Mo wo ẹhin.
That was a bad time.	Iyẹn jẹ akoko buburu.
Two can, but not all three.	Meji le, ṣugbọn kii ṣe gbogbo awọn mẹta.
It is public.	O wa ni gbangba.
The three men understood this.	Awọn ọkunrin mẹta naa loye eyi.
He was there for three years.	O wa nibẹ fun ọdun mẹta.
He stayed in the office for two hours.	O duro ni ọfiisi fun awọn wakati meji.
I think you say as you see.	Mo ro pe o sọ bi o ti ri.
Sometimes that’s what you want.	Nigba miiran iyẹn ni ohun ti o fẹ.
It is noteworthy.	O ṣe akiyesi akiyesi.
It's a bad place.	Ibi buburu ni.
We don't want to talk about that.	A ko fẹ lati sọrọ nipa iyẹn.
It was a very special time.	O jẹ akoko pataki pupọ.
You can not get away.	O ko le gba kuro.
He did as soon as he got home.	O ṣe ni kete ti o de ile.
You are in trouble here.	O wa ninu wahala nibi.
Very easy people here and enjoy life.	Awọn eniyan rọrun pupọ nibi ati gbadun igbesi aye.
With the girl.	Pẹlu ọmọbirin naa.
I mean, do you?	Mo tumọ si, ṣe iwọ?
We cannot do both ways.	A ko le ṣe awọn ọna mejeeji.
On the day the power stops.	Ni ọjọ ti agbara duro.
Anything beyond my mind.	Ohunkohun ti o kọja ọkan mi.
That may not work.	Iyẹn ko le ṣiṣẹ.
He has no power to love a woman.	Ko ni agbara lati nifẹ obinrin kan.
He will have the opportunity to do good.	Oun yoo ni aye lati ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara.
That will not change.	Iyẹn kii yoo yipada.
Her did not come home.	Rẹ ko bọ si ile.
It did not rain for two years.	Ojo ko ro fun odun meji.
I hate to say.	Mo korira lati sọ.
Come on, man.	Wa lori, eniyan.
You get the idea.	O gba ero naa.
It does not cost much.	Ko ni owo pupọ.
I want to have a word with you on that.	Mo fẹ lati ni ọrọ kan pẹlu rẹ lori iyẹn.
To this day he does not say anything about it.	Titi di oni o ko sọ ohunkohun nipa rẹ rara.
I ran out of ideas.	Mo sare jade ti ero.
The sooner we go, the better.	Ni kete ti a ba lọ, yoo dara julọ.
Food may stand.	Ounjẹ le duro.
Make a picture of yourself.	Ṣe aworan ti ara rẹ.
Nothing like that happened.	Ko si iru nkan ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It may be true.	O le jẹ otitọ.
Everyone knows about it.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ nipa rẹ.
Try another possible place.	Gbiyanju aaye miiran o ṣeeṣe.
The home environment is beautiful.	Awọn ayika ile jẹ lẹwa.
You’ve told me a lot more.	O ti sọ fun mi pupọ diẹ.
Help me to understand the error.	Ran mi lọwọ lati ni oye aṣiṣe naa.
That happens all the time.	Iyẹn ṣẹlẹ nigbagbogbo.
To just see this happen.	Lati kan wo eyi ṣẹlẹ.
I do not know what is happening to me.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ si mi.
But that is not all true.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe gbogbo otitọ.
I did not start working with him for the money.	Emi ko bẹrẹ ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ fun owo naa.
It is very informative.	O jẹ alaye pupọ.
I have only written one book without agreement.	Mo ti kọ iwe kan nikan laisi adehun.
Some of them may be here right now.	Diẹ ninu wọn le wa nibi ni bayi.
We do not know.	A ko mọ.
This sounds like non-metallic, non-metallic.	Eyi dabi ohun ti kii ṣe irin, kii ṣe irin.
It tired me like everyone else.	O rẹ mi bi gbogbo eniyan miiran.
They will send this to me.	Wọn yoo fi eyi ranṣẹ si mi.
This woman is not very happy.	Inu obinrin yi ko dun pupo.
But it really did.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe gaan.
We just did to do.	A kan ṣe lati ṣe.
He was able to enter the house.	O ni anfani lati wọ inu ile naa.
They have his name, he said.	Wọn ni orukọ rẹ, o sọ.
The plane arrived in an hour.	Ọkọ ofurufu de ni wakati kan.
He did not want to waste time with details.	Ko fẹ lati padanu akoko pẹlu awọn alaye.
The phone does not ring.	Foonu naa ko dun.
For me, it was wrong.	Fun mi, ko tọ.
I can even understand here.	Mo le paapaa ni oye nibi.
It is not a question of money.	Kii ṣe ibeere ti owo naa.
People are on every single day.	Eniyan wa lori gbogbo nikan ọjọ.
The company has had problems in the last few years.	Ile-iṣẹ naa ti ni awọn iṣoro ni awọn ọdun diẹ sẹhin.
Happy Holidays to you!	Dun isinmi si o!
I will not come back.	Emi kii yoo pada wa.
He did everything very well.	O ṣe ohun gbogbo daradara daradara.
His face could not be seen.	A ko le ri oju rẹ.
It should have gone to me.	O yẹ ki o ti lọ si mi.
The three highest things should be teaching, learning and teaching.	Awọn ohun mẹta ti o ga julọ yẹ ki o jẹ ẹkọ, ẹkọ ati ẹkọ.
But at one point, we started eating at our tables.	Ṣugbọn ni aaye kan, a bẹrẹ si jẹun ni awọn tabili wa.
Is there.	O wa nibẹ.
And even women.	Ati awọn obinrin paapaa.
Everyone who has something to do with this has to go.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu eyi ni lati lọ.
Not good enough to open alone.	Ko dara to lati ṣii nikan.
Much of this and it will break.	Pupọ ti eyi ati pe yoo fọ.
Let it hurt.	Jẹ ki o ṣe ipalara.
I thought only hands.	Mo ro ọwọ nikan.
But wait a minute.	Ṣugbọn duro iṣẹju kan.
That in itself is not true.	Wipe funrararẹ kii ṣe otitọ.
But there is no mistake.	Ṣugbọn ko si aṣiṣe.
Now let's go to sleep.	Bayi jẹ ki a lọ sun.
He will quickly turn his eyes towards the road.	Yoo yara pada oju rẹ si ọna.
These are the conditions.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn ipo mu.
I do not want to.	Mi o fẹ lati.
Now let’s look at the song.	Bayi jẹ ki a wo orin naa.
I just wanted her, wanted any woman, so bad.	Mo ti o kan fe rẹ, fe eyikeyi obinrin, ki buburu.
One can change the world.	Eniyan kan le yi aye pada.
I want you to bring us home a little more.	Mo fẹ ki o mu wa si ile diẹ diẹ.
But for us just husband and children.	Ṣugbọn fun wa o kan ọkọ ati awọn ọmọ.
Here are two points.	Eyi ni awọn aaye meji.
We all have our faults.	Gbogbo wa ni awọn aṣiṣe wa.
Your only problem is small dogs.	Iṣoro rẹ nikan ni awọn aja kekere.
Prices will rise.	Awọn iye owo yoo dide.
The school year will begin soon.	Odun ile-iwe yoo bẹrẹ laipẹ.
This is a great place for advice.	Eyi jẹ aaye nla fun imọran.
You will be able to sleep well from now on.	Iwọ yoo ni anfani lati sun daradara lati igba yii lọ.
However there is something about it.	Sibẹsibẹ nkankan wa nipa rẹ.
We fast forward by ourselves.	A yara ni iwaju nipasẹ ara wa.
And that is not my goal.	Ati pe kii ṣe ipinnu mi.
Let's see what happens.	Jẹ ká wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
In the background, this is the right thing to do.	Ni ẹhin, eyi jẹ ohun ti o tọ lati ṣe.
In fact, it does not allow me to do anything.	Ni otitọ, ko jẹ ki n ṣe ohunkohun.
It has a system that works all the time.	O ni eto ti o ṣiṣẹ ni gbogbo igba.
I can tone up and book a table.	Mo ti le ohun orin si oke ati awọn iwe kan tabili.
It flies on me sure.	O ni fo lori mi daju.
There is no place to run.	Ko si ibi lati sare.
So not for me.	Nitorina ko si fun mi.
But you have to understand.	Sugbon o ni lati ni oye.
But not too hard.	Sugbon ko ju lile.
The others are not there yet.	Awọn miiran ko si nibẹ sibẹsibẹ.
Have some breakfast, talk to the boys.	Ṣe ounjẹ owurọ diẹ, ba awọn ọmọkunrin sọrọ.
Mothers always love their children.	Awọn iya nigbagbogbo nifẹ awọn ọmọ wọn.
Maybe you’re thinking a lot, but at least you’re thinking.	Boya o n ronu pupọ, ṣugbọn o kere ju o n ronu.
I am the brother of everyone on earth.	Emi ni arakunrin ti gbogbo eniyan lori ile aye.
You do not know the world.	O ko mọ aye.
It is what it is.	O jẹ nkan ti o jẹ.
You wouldn’t do that, would you?	Iwọ kii yoo ṣe iyẹn, ṣe iwọ yoo?
He did something he knew he could not do.	O ṣe ohun kan ti o mọ pe ko le ṣe.
Just don’t get it.	O kan ko gba.
Most don’t even do it yourself.	Pupọ julọ ko paapaa ṣe funrararẹ.
It was a beautiful sight.	O je kan lẹwa oju.
No work, no money.	Ko si ise, ko si owo.
I'm happy for him.	Inu mi dun fun u.
I tried every one.	Mo gbiyanju gbogbo ọkan.
These observations are not appropriate.	Awọn akiyesi wọnyi ko yẹ.
He stood up, he stood up.	O dide duro, o duro.
These buildings look good.	Awọn ile wọnyi dara dara.
I also look like a child.	Mo tun dabi ọmọ.
And some great moments, amazing to let you hear.	Ati diẹ ninu awọn akoko nla, iyalẹnu lati jẹ ki o gbọ.
He said he thought they could get a car.	O sọ pe o ro pe wọn le gba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
Back to bed.	Pada si ibusun.
The city is very small.	Ilu naa kere pupọ.
And you can.	Ati pe o le.

You can not understand why he would not eat.	O ko le loye idi ti kii yoo jẹun.
He was sitting on the side ideas.	O ti joko lori awọn ero ẹgbẹ.
They are very sweet.	Wọn dun gaan.
We can do nothing to restore it.	A ko le ṣe ohunkohun lati mu u pada.
He was picked up.	O ti gbe soke.
It should not have been said, you know.	O yẹ ko ti sọ, o mọ.
However, the story is not over yet.	Sibẹsibẹ, itan naa ko ti pari sibẹsibẹ.
It has grown hard.	O ti dagba lile.
But what about all the jobs that will be lost?	Ṣugbọn kini nipa gbogbo awọn iṣẹ ti yoo padanu?
You know you should apply to that.	O mọ pe o yẹ ki o lo si iyẹn.
Do your homework.	Ṣe awọn iṣẹ rẹ.
I really like this place.	Mo feran ibi gan.
One from the doctor has his house there.	Ọkan lati ọdọ dokita ni o ni ile rẹ nibẹ.
It is important to him.	O jẹ pataki fun u.
But now is the time of trial.	Ṣugbọn ni bayi jẹ akoko idanwo.
Until love takes them by surprise.	Titi ifẹ yoo fi gba wọn ni iyalẹnu.
I'll be down in a minute.	Emi yoo wa silẹ ni iṣẹju kan.
I am not telling you people.	Emi ko sọ fun yin eniyan.
But this did.	Ṣugbọn eyi ṣe.
It works well.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara.
The question is, what.	Ibeere naa ni, kini.
Please do not!	Jọwọ maṣe!
You learn about running.	O kọ ẹkọ nipa ṣiṣe.
He was not sure he could even.	Ko da oun loju pe o le paapaa.
A small bag, wrapped around your face.	Apo kekere kan, ti a we di oju rẹ.
He was very dead.	O jẹ pupọ ti o ku.
You know that and you can keep it for many years.	O mọ iyẹn ati pe o le tọju rẹ fun ọdun pupọ.
Foot time.	Igba ẹsẹ.
Don't miss it !.	Maṣe padanu rẹ!.
You have the word and the word is in it.	O ni ọrọ ati ọrọ naa ni o.

I doubt this will stop you.	Mo ṣiyemeji pe eyi yoo da ọ duro.
He doubted, did not decide.	O ṣiyemeji, ko pinnu.

My people's hand.	Ọwọ eniyan mi.
I know how it feels.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe rilara.
Bad things are about to happen.	Awọn ohun buburu ti fẹrẹ ṣẹlẹ.
That car is too old to drive.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yẹn ti dagba ju lati wakọ.
This story is about one of the other seasons.	Itan yii jẹ nipa ọkan ninu awọn akoko miiran.
That changed my mind.	Iyẹn yi ori mi pada.
And yet he did not like it.	Ati sibẹsibẹ ko fẹran rẹ.
The doors open on the last car only.	Awọn ilẹkun ṣii lori ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o kẹhin nikan.
I have known his father for many years.	Mo mọ baba rẹ fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun.

That will not change.	Iyẹn kii yoo yipada.
Do not swim in that river!	Maṣe we ninu odo yẹn!

Look under the bed.	Wo labẹ ibusun.
We have to go through with it now.	A ni lati lọ nipasẹ pẹlu rẹ bayi.
Either way it has to be done.	Ọna boya o ni lati ṣee.
Let things happen.	Jẹ ki awọn nkan ṣẹlẹ.
This is very good news.	Eyi jẹ iroyin ti o dara pupọ.
They are for no reason.	Wọn ti wa ni idi ko si.
I know you do what you can.	Mo mọ pe o ṣe ohun ti o le.
Do some thinking, work with me.	Ṣe diẹ ninu awọn ero, ṣiṣẹ pẹlu mi.
You have my name on it.	O ni orukọ mi lori rẹ.
Walking home takes longer than we expected.	Rin ile gba to gun ju ti a reti lọ.
I cooked for two and ended up being alone.	Mo ṣe ounjẹ fun meji ati pe o pari ni emi nikan.
But it can not.	Sugbon ko le.
He raised his head and looked at the dog.	O gbe ori re pada o si wo aja.
Can't change, that much you know.	Ko le yi pada, wipe Elo o mọ.
Not now, maybe not.	Ko bayi, boya ko mọ.
We will not be able to do that here.	A kii yoo ni anfani lati ṣe iyẹn nibi.
I do not understand.	Oye mi gaan.
So his mother asked his daughter.	Nitorina iya rẹ beere lọwọ ọmọbirin rẹ.
I would never do such a thing.	Emi ko ni ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ.
That would be a big deal.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ nkan nla.
I love your work.	Mo nifẹ iṣẹ rẹ.
I don't expect to see you again.	Ko nireti lati ri ọ lẹẹkansi.
This is for two reasons.	Eyi jẹ nitori idi meji.
I'll give it a go.	Emi yoo fun ni lọ.
Your problem is with me.	Iṣoro rẹ wa pẹlu mi.
It's easy this way.	O rọrun ni ọna yii.
Now, think for a minute.	Bayi, ronu fun iṣẹju kan.
The man did not sit.	Ọkunrin naa ko joko.
My life depends on it.	Igbesi aye mi da lori rẹ.
But he should not have returned to the bar.	Ṣugbọn ko yẹ ki o ti pada si igi.
I missed it.	Mo padanu rẹ.
I have never seen any other like me.	Emi ko ti ri eyikeyi miiran bi emi.
Both methods are well known in the art.	Awọn ọna mejeeji ni a mọ daradara ni aworan.
And that's usually something more interesting.	Ati awọn ti o ni maa n nkankan diẹ awon.
Some stations do not use buses as much anymore.	Diẹ ninu awọn ibudo ko lo awọn akero bi Elo mọ.
Have the phone and everything.	Ni foonu ati ohun gbogbo.
In some hands.	Ni diẹ ninu ọwọ.
Things started to take a turn for me.	Awọn nkan bẹrẹ lati ya fun mi.
I said it was not possible.	Mo sọ pe ko ṣee ṣe.
Even in the matter.	Paapaa ninu ọrọ naa.
First, we need to go back a little.	Ni akọkọ, a nilo lati pada sẹhin diẹ.
We obviously will not accept.	A o han ni yoo ko gba.
He spends all his time indoors.	O lo gbogbo akoko rẹ ninu ile.
Make sure they are not too low or too high.	Rii daju pe wọn ko kere tabi ga ju.
I still can't believe it.	Emi ko tun le gbagbọ.
He did not say what brought us from the outside.	Ko sọ ohun ti o mu wa lati ita.
They’ve had some good times together, at first.	Wọn ti ni diẹ ninu awọn akoko ti o dara papọ, ni akọkọ.
This can be explained by these facts.	Eyi le ṣe alaye nipasẹ awọn otitọ wọnyi.
The new people there must also learn the ropes.	Awọn eniyan tuntun ti o wa nibẹ gbọdọ tun kọ ẹkọ awọn okun.
You can even wear more than one at a time.	O le paapaa wọ diẹ sii ju ọkan lọ ni akoko kan.
I do not mean to offend you in any way.	Emi ko tumọ si lati mu ọ binu ni eyikeyi ọna.
A great big ass of a woman.	Nla nla nla ti obinrin kan.
I have never seen it.	Emi ko tii ri.
He seems to have nothing wrong with himself.	O dabi ẹni pe ko ni ohunkohun ti ko tọ si ara rẹ.
It makes me angry.	O mu mi binu.
If that doesn’t mean anything, leave it at that.	Ti ko ba tumọ si ohunkohun, fi silẹ.
If they can't, they can't.	Ti wọn ko ba le, wọn ko le.
Two heads are better than one.	Ori meji dara ju ọkan lọ.
He could not have walked back home.	Ko le ti rin pada si ile.
I gave him books to read and pictures to look at.	Mo fun u ni awọn iwe lati ka ati awọn aworan lati wo.
It really doesn't come up anymore.	O gan ko ni wa soke mọ.
I have no plans.	Nko ni eto kankan.
He has no money.	Ko ni owo.
One ball, high.	Bọọlu ọkan, giga.
Nice to see you again.	O dara pupọ lati ri ọ lẹẹkansi.
We never finished things to say at all.	A ko pari awọn nkan lati sọ rara.
I will not do anything like that anymore.	Emi kii yoo ṣe ohunkohun bi iyẹn mọ.
And what he did for me.	Ati ohun ti o ṣe fun mi.
But that doesn’t mean no one did.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko tumọ si pe ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe.
He was with her.	O si wà pẹlu rẹ.
I know my life is good.	Mo mọ pe aye mi dara.
You feel wrong.	O ro aṣiṣe.
That is much easier than a question.	Iyẹn rọrun pupọ ju ibeere kan.
I am watering down.	Mo n omi ni isalẹ.
I love them and miss them.	Mo nifẹ wọn ati padanu wọn.
He’s more confident than some of his friends.	O ni idaniloju ju diẹ ninu awọn ọrẹ rẹ lọ.
It can also be important as others see us.	O tun le ṣe pataki bi awọn miiran ṣe rii wa.
They will have more work to do.	Wọn yoo ni iṣẹ diẹ sii lati wa.
How many years have you worked here?	Ọdun melo ni o ti ṣiṣẹ nibi?
They do not have to eat or sleep.	Wọn ko ni lati jẹ tabi sun.
We need to live in a smaller world.	A nilo lati gbe ni aye ti o kere.
The issue is very important.	Ọrọ naa jẹ pataki pataki.
He who has seen it, says nothing.	Ẹniti o ti ri i, ko sọ nkankan.
You must be angry.	O gbọdọ binu ọ.
You really need to leave this out.	O nilo lati fi eyi silẹ gaan.
There was something about the room that scared me.	Nkankan wa nipa yara ti o bẹru mi.
We do not want to be late.	A ko fẹ lati pẹ.
That can make one lose.	Iyẹn le jẹ ki eniyan padanu.
He asked.	O beere fun.
My father died on the last day of school.	Baba mi ku ni ọjọ ti o kẹhin ti ile-iwe.
This should not take too long.	Eyi ko yẹ ki o gba akoko pupọ.
Many students stay overnight at a friend's house.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe duro ni alẹ ni ile ọrẹ kan.
He told me to go and put them in the car.	O sọ fun mi pe ki n lọ fi wọn sinu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
It started.	O bẹrẹ.
As many times as you like.	Bi ọpọlọpọ igba bi o ṣe fẹ.
People think we have a better world.	Awọn eniyan ro pe a ni aye lati dara dara.
He came, he saw, he died.	O wa, o ri, o ku.
Which did not do much to charge him.	Eyi ti ko ṣe pupọ lati gba agbara si i.
They do it first when the business starts.	Wọn ṣe ni akọkọ nigbati owo bẹrẹ.
Try to change that.	Gbiyanju lati yi iyẹn pada.
He has killed many of his teammates.	O ti pa ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹgbẹ rẹ.
I should just give up.	Mo ti yẹ ki o kan fun soke.
That would be an easy way out of it.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ ọna ti o rọrun lati jade ninu rẹ.
They do not have to work for you to get good money.	Wọn ko ni lati ṣiṣẹ fun ọ lati gba owo to dara.
It is necessary.	O ṣe pataki.
He was convinced, at the time, that he was right.	O ni idaniloju, ni akoko yẹn, pe o tọ.
That is a great reward.	Ere nla niyẹn.
I still have one.	Mo tun ni ọkan.
In fact they do, all the time.	Ni otitọ wọn ṣe, ni gbogbo igba.
No one knows'.	Ko si mọ '.
Or any other work even.	Tabi eyikeyi iṣẹ miiran paapaa.
He said it was very beneficial.	O sọ pe o ni anfani pupọ.
You don't seem to want to change things.	O dabi pe o ko fẹ yi awọn nkan pada.
He is nothing.	Oun kii ṣe nkankan.
So is my whole family.	Bẹẹ ni gbogbo idile mi.
He did not allow me.	Ko gba laaye fun mi.
Give them to us.	Fi wọn fun wa.
We want to be more like you.	A fẹ pe diẹ sii wa bi iwọ.
I do not know how to start even.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe le bẹrẹ paapaa.
Other mothers looked up but said nothing.	Awọn iya miiran wo soke ṣugbọn wọn ko sọ nkankan.
You know, below, what that would mean.	O mọ, ni isalẹ, kini iyẹn yoo tumọ si.
I wish you could be me.	Mo fẹ pe o le jẹ emi.
And my friend is right.	Ati pe ọrẹ mi jẹ otitọ.
He waited for them.	O duro de wọn.
I do not have the space to say so.	Emi ko ni aye lati sọ bẹ.
It's high and good.	O ga ati pe o dara.
You do not know his name, age or location.	O ko mọ orukọ rẹ, ọjọ ori tabi ibi ti o wa.
They want to learn the truth.	Wọn fẹ lati kọ ẹkọ ni otitọ.
People are watching.	Eniyan n wo.
You must give everything.	O gbọdọ fun ohun gbogbo.
You can save money.	O le tọju owo.
I'm taking you by surprise.	Mo n mu ọ fun iyalẹnu.
You can not go wrong with this.	O ko le ṣe aṣiṣe pẹlu eyi.
One that is not beautiful.	Ọkan ti ko lẹwa.
There may not have been many places around like this.	Ko le ti ọpọlọpọ awọn aaye ni ayika bi eyi.
I went to my bedroom and opened the old box.	Mo lọ si yara yara mi o si ṣi apoti atijọ.
I began to see.	Mo bẹrẹ lati ri.
There are many new faces.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn oju tuntun wa.
That is the end of it.	Ipari rẹ niyẹn.
Use a light hand.	Lo ọwọ ina.
This will happen.	Eyi yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Your friend will know what to do.	Ọrẹ rẹ yoo mọ ohun ti o yẹ ki o ṣe.
There are many who would not like it.	Ọpọlọpọ wa ti kii yoo fẹ.
We hope to get to know you better.	A nireti lati mọ ọ daradara.
The baby's body has everything it needs.	Ara ọmọ naa ni gbogbo ohun ti o nifẹ si.
Fast cars have high performance engines.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o yara ni awọn ẹrọ iṣẹ ṣiṣe giga.
It can also be.	O tun le jẹ.
I think my system works.	Mo ro pe eto mi ṣiṣẹ.
Home soon past.	Ile ni kete ti o ti kọja.
You can't stay here long.	O ko le duro nibi gun.
When you talk about it to the group, everyone agrees.	Nigbati o sọrọ nipa rẹ si ẹgbẹ, gbogbo eniyan gba.
You don't want to hear my story.	O ko fẹ gbọ itan mi.
One cannot be sure with it.	Eniyan ko le rii daju pẹlu rẹ.
Not very often.	Ko igba pupọ.
You love it, you use it.	O fẹran rẹ, o lo.
They are very happy with each other.	Inu wọn dun pupọ si ara wọn.
But because you are right.	Ṣugbọn nitori o tọ.
Let's look at another.	Jẹ ki a wo miiran.
I totally agree with that.	Mo gba pẹlu iyẹn patapata.
He thought it was possible.	O ro pe o ṣee ṣe.
To wash me.	Lati fo mi.
Everyone benefits from this.	Gbogbo eniyan ni anfani lati eyi.
I know now you have no means.	Mo mọ ni bayi o ko ni awọn ọna.
She held her baby in her arms.	O di ọmọ rẹ mu ni ọwọ rẹ.
We are pretty good.	A ni o lẹwa dara.
Much has changed.	Pupọ ti yipada.
We want you to feel at home.	A fẹ ki o lero ni ile.
This is the way it really works.	Eyi ni ọna ti o ṣiṣẹ gaan.
I will definitely miss you.	Emi yoo padanu rẹ gaan.
Or, very often, both.	Tabi, pupọ nigbagbogbo, mejeeji.
Just use your facial expressions.	O kan lo oju oju rẹ.
He will never forget it.	Oun ko ni gbagbe re.
I slept.	Mo sun.
What is the right way to do this.	Kini ọna ti o tọ lati ṣe eyi.
It almost killed along the way but it didn’t matter.	O fẹrẹ pa ni ọna ṣugbọn kii ṣe pataki.
I have to remember the status of more things.	Mo ni lati ranti ipo ti awọn nkan diẹ sii.
Okay, that sounds great.	O dara, iyẹn dun pupọ.
You can read his article here.	O le ka nkan rẹ nibi.
Not at all.	Ko wa rara.
Sometimes, they might try something else.	Awọn igba miiran, wọn le gbiyanju nkan miiran.
Now do it again.	Bayi tun ṣe lẹẹkansi.
And the marriage is dead.	Ati pe igbeyawo ti ku.
Brother, to be very good.	Arakunrin, lati dara pupọ.
You do not agree on that.	O ko gba lori wipe.
It’s not just about money.	Kii ṣe nipa owo nikan.
Grandpa did.	Baba baba ṣe si.
However, he forced himself to believe in it.	Sibẹsibẹ, o fi agbara mu ara rẹ lati gbagbọ ninu rẹ.
What is not clear to me yet is how small it will go.	Ohun ti ko han si mi sibẹsibẹ ni bi kekere ti yoo lọ.
What you hit in the end doesn’t matter.	Ohun ti o lu ni ipari ko ṣe pataki.
But he could not return.	Ṣugbọn o ko le pada.
Let’s have the money.	Jẹ ki a ni owo naa.

Something you hate, hate, hate.	Nkan ti o korira, korira, korira.
You must accept this fact.	O gbọdọ gba otitọ yii.
But that doesn’t matter.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣe pataki.
He did not learn.	O ko kọ ẹkọ.
No information, no letter to wife and children.	Ko si alaye, ko si lẹta si iyawo ati awọn ọmọ rẹ.
I'm sorry, I heard a man say something.	Ma binu, gbọ ti ọkunrin kan sọ ọrọ kan.
See it from their eyes.	Wo o lati oju wọn.
They sit in front of a restaurant.	Wọn joko ni iwaju ile ounjẹ kan.
Outside the city, locals are friends.	Ni ita ilu naa, awọn ara ilu jẹ ọrẹ.
I haven’t thought about it before.	Emi ko ronu nipa rẹ tẹlẹ.
He never went to school in his life.	Ko lọ si ile-iwe ni igbesi aye rẹ.
My love for you changes everything.	Ifẹ mi si ọ yi ohun gbogbo pada.

She had seen the man before but could not carry him.	O ti rii ọkunrin naa tẹlẹ ṣugbọn ko le gbe e.
It was a test for his life.	O jẹ idanwo fun igbesi aye rẹ.
Now let it go, and take me home.	Bayi jẹ ki o lọ, ki o si mu mi lọ si ile.

Do not go into the water.	Maṣe lọ sinu omi.

Now, things will stay the way they are.	Ni bayi, awọn nkan yoo duro bi wọn ṣe jẹ.

We just love being able to talk to you.	A kan nifẹ lati ni anfani lati ba ọ sọrọ.

Nothing seemed to do but move on.	Ko si dabi enipe nkankan lati se sugbon tẹsiwaju.
You made a big mistake.	O ṣe aṣiṣe nla kan.

Large garden house.	Ile ọgba nla.
And that’s not good.	Ati pe iyẹn ko dara.

People change with time.	Eniyan yipada pẹlu akoko.
You got me nice.	O gba mi dara.

That's the only way.	Iyẹn nikan ni ọna.
You can do this.	O le ṣe eyi.
For this error, we changed.	Fun aṣiṣe yii, a yipada.
Take me, if you must.	Mu mi, ti o ba gbọdọ.

Just a little scared.	O kan bẹru pupọ.
No decisions were made about the program.	A ko ṣe awọn ipinnu nipa eto naa.
You must always keep to the main roads.	O gbọdọ tọju nigbagbogbo si awọn ọna akọkọ.

For a while, the student became his.	Fun igba diẹ, ọmọ ile-iwe di tirẹ.

Put your hands on your back.	Fi ọwọ rẹ si ẹhin rẹ.
Obviously it was the wrong time.	O han ni o jẹ akoko ti ko tọ.
Many people ask me when to buy.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan beere mi nigbati lati ra.
Think about it.	Ronu nipa rẹ.
Sure, good.	Daju, o dara.
He walks with purpose again.	O tun rin pẹlu idi lẹẹkansi.
I think they are beautiful.	Mo ro pe wọn lẹwa.
I haven't seen anything of interest in a few weeks.	Emi ko tii ri nkan ti o nifẹ ninu awọn ọsẹ diẹ.
He hopes the news is good.	O nireti pe iroyin naa dara.
But he kept his light hand on his body.	Ṣugbọn o pa ọwọ ọwọ ina rẹ mọ si ara rẹ.
Let's go.	Jẹ ki a lọ.
They love children.	Wọn nifẹ awọn ọmọde.
He will go where he goes.	Oun yoo lọ si ibi ti o lọ.
If news is dropping you off, turn it off.	Ti iroyin ba n sọ ọ silẹ, pa a.
But we did not stay long.	Sugbon a ko duro gun.
Not everyone is invited.	Kii ṣe gbogbo eniyan ni a pe.
I love celebrations.	Mo nifẹ awọn ayẹyẹ.
They do that and many more.	Wọn ṣe iyẹn ati ọpọlọpọ diẹ sii.
Take a moment to think about this yourself.	Gba akoko kan lati ronu nipa eyi funrararẹ.
I will restore services.	Emi yoo mu awọn iṣẹ pada.
Now he asked me to go.	Bayi o beere fun mi lati lọ.
They just don’t want me to travel yet.	Wọn kan ko fẹ ki n rin irin-ajo sibẹsibẹ.
You are not around.	O ko ti wa ni ayika.
Their plans have not been released.	Awon eto won ko ti gbe jade.

But stay with me here.	Ṣugbọn duro pẹlu mi nibi.
Of course, he is not alone.	Dajudaju, ko ṣe nikan.
And that is hard to get.	Ati pe iyẹn nira lati gba.
Look, you see, they are not just out of school.	Wo, o rii, wọn ko kan kuro ni ile-iwe.
I feel like running.	Mo lero bi ṣiṣe.
To climb a mountain, one needs good hiking boots.	Lati gun oke kan, eniyan nilo bata bata ti o dara.
They will learn at any time.	Wọn yoo kọ ẹkọ ni eyikeyi akoko.
No word on why.	Ko si ọrọ idi.
This is what makes us human.	Eyi ni ohun ti o sọ wa di eniyan.
This is my favorite news story of the week.	Eyi jẹ itan iroyin ayanfẹ mi ti ọsẹ.
But that requires a lot for him.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn n beere pupọ fun u.
Good to go to your site.	O dara lati lọ si aaye rẹ.
We need some time here.	A nilo akoko diẹ nibi.
I do not want to be again.	Emi ko fẹ lati wa ni lẹẹkansi.
Have you read the law?	Njẹ o ti ka iwe ofin naa?
The question is what to do about it.	Ibeere naa ni kini lati ṣe nipa rẹ.
They are also killing each other.	Won tun n pa ara won.
You must.	O gbọdọ.
That story you have to tell.	Ti itan ti o ni lati sọ.
There is no way to do this.	Ko si ọna ti o ṣe eyi.
I am glad you are taking your time.	Inu mi dun pe o n gba akoko rẹ.
He promised me.	O ṣe ileri fun mi.
Easy to make and they are good.	Rọrun lati ṣe ati pe wọn dara.
This is how we live our lives.	Eyi ni bi a ṣe n gbe igbesi aye wa.
They talk about their day.	Wọn sọrọ nipa ọjọ wọn.
They do.	Wọn tun ṣe.
Go to the idea.	Lo si ero naa.
This is what they are trying to do.	Eyi ni wọn n gbiyanju lati ṣe.
He is the father of many children.	O jẹ baba ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde.
I don't want to go back to the office.	Emi ko fẹ lati pada si ọfiisi.
It has been a few years since they found each other.	O ti jẹ ọdun diẹ ti wọn ti ri ara wọn.
Maybe they even went for a month.	Boya wọn paapaa lọ fun oṣu kan.
I don't have anything good.	Emi ko ni ohun ti o dara.
The city has a long history.	Ilu wa ni itan ti o gun.
Something like it must have happened.	Nkankan bi o gbọdọ ti ṣẹlẹ.
We will tell him what we want him to do.	A yoo sọ fun u ohun ti a fẹ ki o ṣe.
If you can.	Ti o ba le.
You see what is really important.	O rii ohun ti o ṣe pataki gaan.
It has become a meeting place.	O ti di ibi ipade diẹ.
I have never had such a tea before.	Ko tii ni iru tii kan tẹlẹ ṣaaju.
I started to fear I was telling the truth.	Mo bẹrẹ lati bẹru mi o sọ otitọ.
I help you really love me.	Mo ran o ni ife mi gan.
He promised to return.	O ṣe ileri lati pada.
Be as good as you can be.	Jẹ dara bi o ṣe jẹ.
Some for one reason, some for others.	Diẹ ninu awọn fun idi kan, diẹ ninu awọn fun awọn miiran.
Tell you what.	Sọ fun ọ kini.
She quickly ate her lunch and left.	O yara jẹ ounjẹ ọsan rẹ o si lọ.
He was good enough to say as much.	O si wà dara to lati sọ bi Elo.
Do everything in your name.	Ṣe ohun gbogbo ni orukọ rẹ.
He seemed to be everywhere.	O dabi enipe o wa nibi gbogbo.
Look at the other well.	Wo awọn miiran daradara.
No one is talking about it anymore.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọrọ nipa rẹ mọ.
He missed the bus this morning.	O padanu ọkọ akero ni owurọ yi.
You may or may not get this.	O le tabi ko le gba eyi.
No music.	Ko si orin.
All you have to do is wait.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ni lati ṣe ni duro.
The other two, however, need information.	Awọn meji miiran, sibẹsibẹ, nilo alaye.
He is there every day or so for little things.	O wa ni gbogbo ọjọ tabi bẹ fun awọn nkan kekere.
Go ahead, something hot.	Tẹsiwaju, nkan ti o gbona.
You don’t want to talk about your test.	O ko fẹ sọrọ nipa idanwo rẹ.
The sun is hot.	Oorun gbona.
They are coming, for sure. 	Wọn ti bọ, fun daju. 
I do not like cats.	Nko feran ologbo.
I have no idea what to say.	Emi ko ni imọran kini lati sọ.
But look, a story works its way in it.	Ṣugbọn wo, itan kan ṣiṣẹ ọna rẹ ninu rẹ.
It makes everyone better.	O mu ki gbogbo eniyan dara julọ.
It is better to keep this.	O dara ki o tọju eyi.
It is not part of a company.	Kii ṣe ara ile-iṣẹ kan.
There is a fast food restaurant here.	Ile ounjẹ ounjẹ yara kan wa nibi.
Originally meant "a little more food."	Ni akọkọ tumọ si "diẹ diẹ ninu ounjẹ."
Some will give more.	Diẹ ninu awọn yoo fun diẹ.
I can read in your eyes.	Mo le ka ni oju rẹ.
And you are in it.	Ati pe o wa ninu rẹ.
I don’t expect you to start on it soon.	Emi ko nireti pe iwọ yoo bẹrẹ lori rẹ laipẹ.
Things will be better next week.	Awọn nkan yoo dara ni ọsẹ to nbọ.
So we can be better.	Nitorina a le dara julọ.
Really little kids, they want you out with them.	Awọn ọmọ kekere ti o gaan, wọn fẹ ki o jade pẹlu wọn.
After a while, he spoke.	Lẹhin akoko kan, o sọrọ.
I can not find a reason to continue.	Emi ko le rii idi kan lati tẹsiwaju.
And there is still plenty of time for more.	Ati pe ọpọlọpọ akoko tun wa fun diẹ sii.
No man.	Ko si eniyan.
Maybe a lot of you do, though.	Boya ọpọlọpọ awọn ti o ṣe, paapaa.
And we can.	Ati pe a le.
You are not happy.	Inu re ko dun.
Killing it will explain it to you one day.	Pa rẹ yoo ṣe alaye rẹ fun ọ ni ọjọ kan.
And before you go to the store.	Ati ṣaaju ki o to lọ si ile itaja.
You will not know our name or see our faces.	Iwọ kii yoo mọ orukọ wa tabi wo oju wa.
That's for sure.	Iyẹn daju.
If you do not sell it you should.	Ti o ko ba ta o o yẹ.
This should not take more than a few minutes.	Eyi ko yẹ ki o gba diẹ sii ju iṣẹju diẹ lọ.
I also enjoyed everything.	Mo tun gbadun ohun gbogbo.
I am not wrong with it.	Emi ko ni aṣiṣe pẹlu rẹ.
He asked why he was not with her.	O beere idi ti o ko wa pẹlu rẹ.
I just let them go again.	Mo kan gba wọn laaye lẹẹkansi.
Maybe it was a mistake they made.	Boya o jẹ aṣiṣe ti wọn ṣe.
With that said.	Pẹlu iyẹn sọ.
The new world will not need small pictures.	Aye tuntun kii yoo nilo awọn aworan kekere.
I do not understand why they would do that.	Emi ko loye idi ti wọn yoo ṣe iyẹn.
It changed.	O yipada.
Maybe it’s the foreclosure of a house.	Boya o jẹ igba lọwọ ẹni ti ile kan.
That goes for this song.	Iyẹn lọ fun orin yii.
We will miss you.	A yoo padanu rẹ.
Those working in the industry can continue to do so.	Awọn ti n ṣiṣẹ ni ile-iṣẹ le tẹsiwaju lati ṣe bẹ.
That dress is amazing.	Aṣọ yẹn jẹ iyanu.
You will have to go to someone who will give him less.	O yoo ni lati lọ si ẹnikan ti yoo fun u kere.
But apparently someone was in the house.	Ṣugbọn o han gbangba pe ẹnikan wa ninu ile naa.
Maybe he was one of them.	Boya o jẹ ọkan ninu wọn.
I will be back.	Emi yoo pada wa.
We have known him for a while.	A ti mọ ọ fun igba diẹ.
But we have a little idea.	Ṣugbọn a ni imọran diẹ.
No one was found there.	Ko si ẹnikan ti a ri nibẹ.
Meals will take time.	Ounjẹ yoo gba akoko.
I know that of course.	Mo mọ iyẹn dajudaju.
I can only ask you.	Mo le beere rẹ nikan.
This bread is by hand.	Akara yii jẹ pẹlu ọwọ.
Changing your question is a little over the top.	Yipada ibeere rẹ jẹ diẹ lori oke.
Visit this restaurant!	Lọ si ile ounjẹ yii!
I just want to try whether something will come out of it.	Mo kan fẹ gbiyanju boya nkan kan yoo jade ninu rẹ.
And get in the bath.	Ati ki o gba ninu awọn wẹ.
It started well.	O bẹrẹ daradara.
And my information is there.	Ati alaye mi wa nibẹ.
Maybe, he thought.	Boya, o ro.
To bed.	Si ibusun.
The drink is very sweet for your taste.	Ohun mimu naa dun pupọ fun ifẹ rẹ.
He’s trying to understand.	O n gbiyanju lati ni oye.
You can say in your heart.	O le sọ ninu ọkan rẹ.
Great things happen to everyone.	Awọn nkan nla ṣẹlẹ si gbogbo eniyan.
Let's head back.	Jẹ ká ori pada.
He died for the right reason.	O ku ni idi ti o tọ.
For good or for bad, this is where it comes from.	Fun dara tabi fun buburu, eyi ni ibi ti o ti wa.
Do you notice any unfamiliar faces?	Njẹ o ṣe akiyesi eyikeyi awọn oju ti ko mọ bi?
I was only there three days.	Mo wa nibẹ nikan ọjọ mẹta.
It seems to come from another era.	O dabi pe o wa lati akoko miiran.
However can not.	Sibẹsibẹ ko le.
I have no way of knowing.	Emi ko ni ọna ti o mọ.
Going uphill is a lot easier than going up.	Lilọ si oke rọrun pupọ ju lilọ lọ.
They can see me.	Wọn le rii mi.
His wife went into work for a while.	Iyawo rẹ lọ sinu iṣẹ fun diẹ.
He didn’t want any seriousness.	Ko fẹ eyikeyi ti o ṣe pataki.
I do not understand why he would say no.	Emi ko loye idi ti yoo sọ rara.
Time to book on out of place.	Akoko lati iwe lori jade ti ibi.
He finished his classes.	O pari awọn kilasi rẹ.
Everyone, they all slept from the inside out.	Gbogbo eniyan, gbogbo wọn sun lati inu jade.
Everyone is working towards a better life.	Gbogbo eniyan n ṣiṣẹ si ọna igbesi aye to dara julọ.
I wondered how they would let me go.	Mo ṣe iyalẹnu bawo ni wọn yoo ṣe jẹ ki n lọ.
He gave a gift to two of the best students.	O fun awọn ọmọ ile-iwe meji ti o dara julọ ni ẹbun kan.
So live in my love.	Nitorina gbe ninu ifẹ mi.
I would have hoped this would go down.	Emi yoo ti nireti pe eyi yoo lọ si isalẹ.
I dropped it.	Mo ti sọ ọ silẹ.
They take of course.	Wọn gba dajudaju.
Not very sure.	Ko daju pupọ.
And we must do something about his name.	Ati pe a gbọdọ ṣe nkan nipa orukọ rẹ.
Most do not eat in a week.	Ọpọlọpọ ko jẹun ni ọsẹ kan.
They’re really trying to just start the whole thing again.	Wọn n gbiyanju gaan lati kan bẹrẹ gbogbo nkan naa lẹẹkansi.
We write a song and tell a story.	A kọ orin kan ati sọ itan kan.
I'll leave you, if you will.	Emi yoo fi ọ silẹ, ti o ba fẹ.
I can tell him even from the back.	Mo le sọ fun u paapaa lati ẹhin.
And it just happens to be very good.	Ati pe o kan ṣẹlẹ lati dara pupọ daradara.
It's not raining.	Ojo ko ti ro ni ojo.
Maybe not just money.	Boya kii ṣe owo nikan.
He does not accept groups.	Ko gba awọn ẹgbẹ.
You could say you want to say more.	O le sọ pe o fẹ lati sọ diẹ sii.
Either way, buy this book.	Ọna boya, ra iwe yi.
Because the game school test has been delayed by an hour.	Nitori idanwo ile-iwe ere naa ti ti ti sẹhin ni wakati kan.
Pick any one of the three you like.	Mu eyikeyi ọkan ninu awọn mẹta ti o fẹ.
Do you want to pass? 	Ṣe o fẹ lati kọja?
They created our office.	Wọn da ọfiisi wa.
But that’s not the way things work.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọna ti awọn nkan n ṣiṣẹ.
This makes things easier.	Eyi jẹ ki awọn nkan rọrun.
I continue to corrupt myself.	Mo tẹsiwaju lati ba ara mi jẹ.
Do not forget this place.	Maṣe gbagbe aaye yii.
The sister had been one of my favorite people that day.	Arabinrin naa ti jẹ ọkan ninu awọn eniyan ayanfẹ mi ni ọjọ yẹn.
You know his name.	O mọ orukọ rẹ.
You just want the best deal possible.	O kan fẹ adehun ti o dara julọ ṣee ṣe.
Do not underestimate anyone.	Maṣe kere ẹnikẹni.
Two important points should be noted here.	Awọn aaye pataki meji yẹ ki o ṣe akiyesi nibi.
There was a woman sitting in the back seat.	Obinrin kan wa ti o joko ni ẹhin ijoko.
And that is the way it will be.	Ati pe iyẹn ni ọna ti yoo jẹ.
The past is over and done with.	Awọn ti o ti kọja jẹ lori ati ki o ṣe pẹlu.
The car is better than it was on the day it was purchased.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa dara ju bi o ti ṣe lọ ni ọjọ ti o ra.
He wants to stay.	O fe lati duro ni.
This is a good thing.	Eyi jẹ ohun ti o dara.
I'm looking for your bags.	Mo wa awọn apo rẹ.
Nice to meet you too.	O dara lati pade iwọ paapaa.
These must be stopped.	Awọn gbọdọ wa ni duro.
This may not be.	Eyi le ma ṣe.
So he would talk.	Nitorina o yoo sọrọ.
The accident caused a lot of damage.	Ijamba naa fa ipalara pupọ.
He thought it would make him some money.	O ro pe yoo ṣe fun u diẹ ninu owo.
We don't have a dog.	A ko ni aja.
He did, and he changed.	O ṣe, o si yipada.
Without them this book could not have been written.	Laisi wọn iwe yii ko le ti kọ.
I mean, there was nothing that I was not asked to do.	Mo tumọ si, ko si nkankan ti a ko beere lọwọ mi.
His reason tells him that of course it is better.	Idi rẹ sọ fun u pe dajudaju o dara julọ.
Plan on it.	Gbero lori rẹ.
But he did not ask.	Sugbon ko beere o.
However, one person was not present.	Sibẹsibẹ, eniyan kan ko wa.
They love to be able to eat whatever they want or anyone.	Wọn nifẹ lati ni anfani lati jẹ ohunkohun ti wọn fẹ tabi ẹnikẹni.
I think that is their life.	Mo ro pe igbesi aye wọn niyẹn.
Those who spoke about it told him more.	Awọn ti o nipa rẹ sọ diẹ fun u.
It was clear.	O je ko o.
We already know them.	A ti mọ wọn.
I do not belong to that idea itself, for the reasons already explained.	Emi kii ṣe ti ero yẹn funrararẹ, fun awọn idi alaye tẹlẹ.
He brushed his hair from his face.	O si fọ irun rẹ lati oju rẹ.
In my own voice.	Ninu ohun ti ara mi.
It's too late.	O ti pẹ.
I also want a name.	Mo tun fẹ orukọ kan.
She thought about it.	O ro nipa rẹ.
At least they saw it in time.	Ni o kere wọn ri i ni akoko.
I have news for you.	Mo ni iroyin fun ọ.
This city has few trees.	Ilu yii ni awọn igi diẹ.
There is nothing.	Ko si nkan.
However it does not.	Sibẹsibẹ ko ni.
The cars are great.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ jẹ nla.
They passed my parents' room.	Wọn kọja yara awọn obi mi.
At this point it will not help.	Ni aaye yii kii yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.
And it will happen soon.	Ati pe yoo ṣẹlẹ laipẹ.
He placed his head on the table.	O gbe ori rẹ si ori tabili.
Like my sister, and our mother, and our father.	Bi arabinrin mi, ati iya wa, ati baba wa.
They just want to move.	Wọn kan fẹ lati gbe.
You should call the police.	O yẹ ki o pe ọlọpa.
Say one way.	Sọ ọna kan.
All this is explained there.	Gbogbo eyi ni a ṣe alaye nibẹ.
No one will believe me.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo gbagbọ mi.
You know there is a car in my house.	O mọ pe ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wa ni ile mi.
He would not say.	Oun yoo ko sọ.
Some people say write what you know.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan sọ pe kọ ohun ti o mọ.
You’re talking better.	O n sọrọ dara julọ.
This is good news.	Eyi ni iroyin ti o dara.
It will make life a lot easier.	Yoo jẹ ki igbesi aye rọrun pupọ.
I just use my stuff up.	Mo kan lo nkan mi soke.
Maybe now is the time.	Boya bayi ni akoko naa.
I went to see you last night.	Mo lọ wo o ni alẹ ana.
Also all in their homes, too.	Tun gbogbo ni won ile, ju.
He turned and left.	O yipada o si lọ.
Now you have to find a place to die.	Bayi o ni lati wa aaye lati ku.
His mother seemed to think.	Iya rẹ dabi pe o ronu.
We will miss you.	A yoo padanu rẹ.
We are a good team.	A jẹ ẹgbẹ ti o dara.
However he thought it was best to let it work out.	Sibẹsibẹ o ti ro pe o dara julọ lati jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ jade.
He had committed suicide in the house.	O ti fi ara si ile naa.
You can not say what such a person will do.	O ko le sọ ohun ti eniyan iru yoo ṣe.
This is a mistake.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
She will wait and look at him.	O yoo duro ati ki o wo si rẹ.
He would like to travel in time.	Oun yoo fẹ lati rin irin-ajo ni akoko.
So you know that this has to be important.	Nitorina o mọ pe eyi ti ni lati ṣe pataki.
We have to tell the police.	A ni lati sọ fun ọlọpa.
The sun was setting as the morning approached.	Oorun lu bi owurọ ti n lọ.
They have never lived in a house.	Wọn ko ti gbe ni ile kan.
But that doesn’t mean you drink regularly.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko tumọ si pe o mu nigbagbogbo.
Some believe they are for themselves.	Diẹ ninu awọn gbagbọ pe wọn wa nitori ara wọn.
All you need is your wedding documents.	Gbogbo ohun ti o nilo ni awọn iwe igbeyawo rẹ.
I'm not even sure if there is anything to get.	Emi ko paapaa daju boya nkan wa lati gba.
There is talk but not found.	O wa ọrọ ṣugbọn ko ri.
This is always hard for me.	Eyi jẹ nkan lile nigbagbogbo fun mi.
And not just here.	Kii ṣe nibi nikan.
Both started towards the city.	Awọn mejeeji bẹrẹ si ọna ilu.
I have my own device.	Mo ni ẹrọ ti ara mi.
They spoke for two hours.	Wọn sọ fun wakati meji.
You should have done it yourself.	O yẹ ki o ti ṣe funrararẹ.
They never went.	Wọn ko lọ rara.
Love your friends.	Nifẹ awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
Many others.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran.
She decided to tell him everything.	O pinnu lati sọ ohun gbogbo fun u.
I have met him before.	Mo ti pade rẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
And we can talk about that a little bit.	Ati pe a le sọrọ nipa iyẹn diẹ diẹ.
You are gone.	O ti lọ.
It is better to hurry if you want to take the train.	O dara ki o yara ti o ba fẹ mu ọkọ oju irin naa.
He is one of these people.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn eniyan wọnyi.
We cannot be sure.	A ko le ni idaniloju.
I want you to find your children.	Mo fẹ ki o wa awọn ọmọ rẹ.
I loved it to go.	Mo ti nifẹ rẹ lati lọ.
What do you feel like to have legs.	Kini o ro bi lati ni awọn ẹsẹ.
He is always with me.	O tun wa pẹlu mi nigbagbogbo.
There is no city in my house anymore.	Ko si ilu ni ile mi mọ.
It is your place.	Ibi rẹ ni.
It’s understandable if you think about it.	O jẹ oye ti o ba ronu nipa rẹ.
No errors have been shown.	Ko si aṣiṣe ti han.
Not the only way.	Kii ṣe ọna nikan.
They never even talked to each other again.	Wọn ko paapaa sọrọ si ara wọn lẹẹkansi.
Or try to eat.	Tabi gbiyanju lati jẹ.
Maybe not.	Boya ko yẹ.
Or maybe already.	Tabi boya tẹlẹ.
So what we have now.	Nitorina ohun ti a ni ni bayi.
One of the last jobs.	Ọkan ninu awọn ti o kẹhin ise.
It's an opportunity.	O jẹ nkan anfani.
He wrote stories at night.	O kọ awọn itan ni alẹ.
He will no longer need it.	Oun ko ni nilo rẹ mọ.
He said he would come, but he did not.	O sọ pe oun yoo wa, ṣugbọn ko ṣe bẹ.
I wouldn’t love another one like this.	Emi kii yoo nifẹ miiran bi eleyi.
Truth! 	Otitọ!
Accept, carry it.	Gba, gbe e.
Behind them is our strength.	Lẹhin wọn ni okun wa.
It will not be difficult to decide which.	Kii yoo nira lati pinnu eyi ti.
Someone knows about the money.	Ẹnikan mọ nipa owo naa.
How, for a while, it seemed like it was possible for him.	Bawo, fun igba diẹ, o ti dabi pe o ṣee ṣe fun u.
But, you know, you shouldn’t believe everything you hear.	Ṣugbọn, o mọ, o yẹ ki o ko gbagbọ ohun gbogbo ti o gbọ.
They have walked down the road.	Wọn ti rin si ọna.
He cannot let his child die.	Ko le jẹ ki ọmọ rẹ ku.
You are feeling better.	O ti wa ni rilara dara.
The men will come home.	Awọn ọkunrin yoo wa si ile.
And yet it is not.	Ati sibẹsibẹ ko jẹ.
They work all day.	Wọn ṣiṣẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
He died at this sister's house.	O ku ni ile arabinrin yi.
I find this correct.	Mo ri eyi ti o tọ.
Or because they do.	Tabi nitori wọn ṣe.
Please continue the story.	Jọwọ tẹsiwaju itan naa.
I have no problem with it.	Emi ko ni iṣoro pẹlu rẹ.
Please, please, continue.	Jọwọ jọwọ, tẹsiwaju.
I should have known better.	Mo ti yẹ ki o mọ dara julọ.
As you can see it passes.	Bii o ṣe le rii pe o kọja rẹ.
It was the only road.	O je nikan ni opopona.
Both write games about his life.	Awọn mejeeji kọ awọn ere nipa igbesi aye rẹ.
We do not have to be afraid.	A ko ni lati bẹru.
This was last month.	Eyi jẹ oṣu to kọja.
He is my day.	Oun ni ọjọ mi.
The police are there now.	Ọlọpa wa nibẹ ni bayi.
That would mean you want to stay.	Iyẹn yoo tumọ si pe o fẹ lati duro.
Sometimes, that just takes time.	Nigba miiran, iyẹn kan gba akoko.
Or they will say we are trying to touch them or something.	Tabi wọn yoo sọ pe a gbiyanju lati fi ọwọ kan wọn tabi nkankan.
Go home if they need it.	Lọ si ile ti wọn ba nilo rẹ.
I'll get it back.	Emi yoo gba pada.
He refused to wait.	O kọ lati duro.
Try both and not there.	Gbiyanju mejeeji ati kii ṣe nibẹ.
He just had to stay close to her and she was happy.	Oun nikan ni lati duro nitosi rẹ ati pe inu rẹ dun.
I do not know when he will return.	Emi ko mọ igba ti yoo pada wa.
I have to help others now.	Mo ni lati ran awọn miiran lọwọ ni bayi.
Just look at it.	O kan wo o.
You don’t expect that from me.	O ko reti iyẹn lati ọdọ mi.
After hearing that, we decided to try it out for ourselves.	Lẹhin ti a gbọ pe, a pinnu lati gbiyanju o jade fun ara wa.
It was a long way to go before we got home.	O jẹ ọna pipẹ lati lọ ṣaaju ki a to wa ni ile.
We feel good when we get things done.	A lero ti o dara nigba ti a ba gba ohun ṣe.
It's interesting	O ni awon
But it just didn't happen.	Sugbon ko kan ṣẹlẹ.
The meeting was very hot and full.	Ipade naa gbona pupọ ati pe o kun.
Okay, get out of it, the two of you.	O dara, jade kuro ninu rẹ, awọn meji ti o.
They also made their home.	Wọn tun ṣe ile wọn.
Say it was something you had to do.	So wipe o je ohun ti o ni lati se.
Now you look up.	Bayi o wo soke.
It did not happen.	Ko ṣẹlẹ.
He will not tell us anything.	Ko ni so fun wa nkankan.
I like running upstairs.	Mo fẹran ṣiṣe oke.
Some did well in every class.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣe daradara ni gbogbo kilasi.
I should have felt it waiting for me.	Mo ti yẹ ki o lero pe o n duro de mi.
Or even a month.	Tabi paapaa oṣu kan.
Think for yourself and open up to new ideas.	Ronu fun ara rẹ ki o ṣii si awọn imọran tuntun.
They are also in the first year of their marriage.	Wọn tun wa ni ọdun akọkọ ti igbeyawo wọn.
I never talked about it.	Emi ko sọrọ nipa rẹ rara.
I mean not at all.	Mo tumọ si kii ṣe rara.
Do not take advantage of me.	Maṣe gba anfani mi.
It will just continue to be yourself.	O kan yoo tẹsiwaju lati jẹ funrararẹ.
I make the same suggestion.	Mo ṣe imọran kanna.
You are not worried.	O ko ni aniyan.
You love that.	O nifẹ iyẹn.
But he didn’t leave things there.	Ṣugbọn ko fi awọn nkan silẹ nibẹ.
I have a little something on it.	Mo ni nkan kekere kan lori rẹ.
I have never seen anything like it, either.	Ko tii ri ohunkohun bii eyi, boya.
Whatever it is, you want it.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ, o fẹ.
Save me a great time.	Gba mi ni akoko nla.
This family is an ancient family story.	Ebi yii jẹ itan idile atijọ.
What the field port does not matter.	Ohun ti ibudo aaye ko ṣe pataki.
I am very happy with their work.	Inu mi dun pupọ pẹlu iṣẹ wọn.
That’s all that matters to me.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo nkan ti o ṣe pataki si mi.
Do not let anyone know you are here.	Maṣe jẹ ki ẹnikẹni mọ pe o wa nibi.
Now the situation has changed a bit.	Bayi ipo naa ti yipada diẹ.
We put up.	A fi oke si.
But you have room to think.	Ṣugbọn o ni aye lati ronu.
I'm glad we didn't.	Inu mi dun pe a ko.
I asked about it a lot.	Mo beere nipa rẹ pupọ.
It is also hot outside.	O tun gbona ni ita.
It also works.	O tun ṣiṣẹ.
No one wants to go back to the old area.	Ko si ẹniti o fẹ lati pada si agbegbe atijọ.
There are so many.	O wa pupọ.
Everyone was worried about them.	Gbogbo eniyan ni wọn ṣe aniyan nipa wọn.
Very good thing.	Nkan ti o dara pupọ.
That, of course, is done.	Iyẹn, paapaa, ti ṣe.
I remember to this day.	Mo ranti titi di oni.
But let me tell you this.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki n sọ eyi fun ọ.
I will definitely be back next year !.	Emi yoo dajudaju pada sẹhin ni ọdun to nbọ!.
I want to know what they are.	Mo fẹ lati mọ kini wọn jẹ.
This has been dead for a long time.	Eyi ti ku fun igba pipẹ.
He read the books, and he knew what was going on.	O ka awọn iwe, ati pe o mọ ohun ti n lọ.
It probably never happened to him.	O ṣeeṣe ko ti ṣẹlẹ si i.
If they are honest they should call for help.	Ti wọn ba jẹ otitọ wọn gbọdọ pe fun iranlọwọ.
Do you see her, mother?	Ṣe o ri i, iya?
I can not do that.	Emi ko le ṣe iyẹn.
Your children love it.	Awọn ọmọ rẹ fẹran rẹ.
I am under stress every single day.	Mo wa labẹ wahala ni gbogbo ọjọ kan.
Same with fire.	Kanna pẹlu ina.
Other things worked.	Awọn ohun miiran ti ṣiṣẹ.
I raised my hand, but he did not see me.	Mo gbe ọwọ mi soke, ṣugbọn ko ri mi.
But he never asked.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe ibeere rẹ rara.
That’s where you can get to know it from.	Iyẹn ni ibiti o ti le mọ ọ lati.
Winter will be short but very hard.	Igba otutu yoo wa ni pẹ diẹ ṣugbọn lile pupọ.
It is only a matter of time.	O ti wa ni nikan ọrọ kan ti akoko.
If this is true, give it a try.	Ti eyi ba jẹ otitọ, fun ni bọtini kan.
I do not know with both.	Emi ko mọ pẹlu awọn mejeeji.
This question needs to be simple and fast.	Ibeere yii nilo lati rọrun ati yara.
Change one word or two.	Yi ọrọ kan tabi meji pada.
You have cut off your work for him.	O ti ge iṣẹ rẹ kuro fun u.
Okay, that's good to hear.	O dara, iyẹn dara lati gbọ.
It depends on the size and location of the phone.	O da lori bii ati ibiti o ṣe mu foonu naa.
But this is also good.	Ṣugbọn eyi tun dara.
I put something on.	Mo fi nkan si.
They entered the room.	Wọn wọ inu yara naa.
At the same time he felt compelled to continue.	Ni akoko kanna o ro pe o fi agbara mu lati tẹsiwaju.
I almost want to say they have a lot of imagination.	Mo fẹrẹ fẹ sọ pe wọn ni oju inu pupọ.
I’m sure that’s what you think about.	Mo daju pe iyẹn ni ohun ti o ro nipa.
You need to stay here and keep your head down.	O nilo lati duro nibi ki o si fi ori rẹ silẹ.
They won’t even want this.	Wọn kii yoo paapaa fẹ eyi.
See if this works for you.	Wo boya eyi ba ṣiṣẹ fun ọ.
That is what it is.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti o wa.
He saw it as a gift.	O ri i bi ẹbun.
Good on everything.	O dara lori ohun gbogbo.
I just want to see what happens.	Mo kan fẹ lati rii kini yoo ṣẹlẹ.
He seems to understand music.	O dabi ẹni pe o ni oye nipa orin.
I can not go into the past or see the future.	Emi ko le lọ sinu awọn ti o ti kọja tabi ri ojo iwaju.
To crush on a piece of bread.	Lati fun pa lori nkan akara.
But not just any story.	Sugbon ko o kan eyikeyi itan.
They are not angry.	Wọn ko binu.
I love this wedding !.	Mo feran igbeyawo yii!.
You do not know, but you will learn.	O ko mọ, ṣugbọn yoo kọ ẹkọ.
Go ahead, men.	Tẹsiwaju, awọn ọkunrin.
Not a good background to be.	Ko kan ti o dara lẹhin lati wa ni.
Some work, most do not.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣiṣẹ, pupọ julọ ko ṣe.
But no one knows that.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ iyẹn.
A little piece of something as you like.	A kekere nkan ti nkankan bi o fe.
He locked the door.	O ti ilẹkun si.
Let it do its job.	Jẹ ki o ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
It's time to dump her and move on.	O to akoko lati lọ ni bayi.
You can talk to him, at least.	O le ba a sọrọ, o kere ju.
I would have loved to know who and hurt them.	Emi yoo ti nifẹ lati mọ tani ati ṣe ipalara wọn.
If you are something of that.	Ti o ba wa nkankan ti o.
They must have left.	Wọn gbọdọ ti lọ kuro.
Everything has been great.	Ohun gbogbo ti jẹ nla.
We need to call it out.	A nilo lati pe o jade.
There is a reason but not just one.	O jẹ idi kan ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọkan nikan.
And it can be very harmful when this happens.	Ati pe o le jẹ ipalara pupọ nigbati eyi ba ṣẹlẹ.
It is not something they decide to do.	Kii ṣe nkan ti wọn pinnu lati ṣe.
They asked about his last work, and how he did it.	Wọn beere nipa iṣẹ rẹ ti o kẹhin, ati bi o ṣe ṣe.
You have made yourself perfect.	O ti ṣe ara rẹ pe.
We must help these people in any way we can.	A gbọdọ ran awọn eniyan wọnyi lọwọ ni eyikeyi ọna ti a le.
No, we have not talked about it.	Rara, a ko ti sọrọ nipa rẹ.
Not one way.	Kii ṣe ọna kan.
They do this every year.	Wọn ṣe eyi ni gbogbo ọdun.
No one can do that anymore.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o le ṣe iyẹn mọ.
Just continue.	O kan tẹsiwaju.
You have an idea in your mind that you need to get out.	O ni ero kan ninu ọkan rẹ ti o nilo lati jade.
Physically.	Nipa ti ara.
I will not worry about it.	Emi kii yoo ṣe aniyan nipa rẹ.
I promise it is not me.	Mo ṣe ileri pe kii ṣe emi.
We only have their word that there is one.	A nikan ni ọrọ wọn pe ọkan wa.
I will not let that happen.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ.
He really used his hands.	O lo ọwọ rẹ gaan.
She was afraid of him.	O bẹru rẹ.
You look down the street.	O wo isalẹ ita.
As he said, no one would know he was there.	Bi o ṣe sọ, ko si ẹnikan ti yoo mọ pe o wa nibẹ.
No, he did not tell anyone.	Rara, ko sọ fun ẹnikẹni.
See, all this should never happen.	Wo, gbogbo nkan yii ko yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ rara.
I will keep an eye on this from here.	Emi yoo pa oju kan lori eyi lati ibi.
If you wait.	Ti o ba duro.
They are behind them all.	Wọn wa lẹhin gbogbo wọn.
We do not like summer weather.	A ko fẹ ojo ooru.
We don’t even have to talk to each other.	A ko paapaa ni lati sọrọ si ara wa.
We must go.	A gbọdọ lọ.
Everyone is asking questions.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o n yi ibeere jade si i.
For yet wait.	Fun sibẹsibẹ duro.
He did it again.	O tun ṣe lẹẹkansi.
For me, that was not a difficult decision to make.	Fun mi, iyẹn kii ṣe ipinnu ti o nira lati ṣe.
I want you to get up and run.	Mo fe dide ki o sare.
I'll just pick up my clothes and shoes.	Emi yoo kan mu aṣọ ati bata mi.
They do not make the first move.	Won ko ba ko ṣe akọkọ Gbe.
Some people will know, but not many.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan yoo mọ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọpọlọpọ.
Not the same everywhere.	Kii ṣe kanna nibi gbogbo.
It was a lot of work.	O je kan pupo ti ise.
But now the sun is going down.	Ṣugbọn ni bayi oorun ti n lọ silẹ.
What made you decide to quit your job?	Kini o jẹ ki o pinnu lati fi iṣẹ rẹ silẹ?
This is done in a very interesting way.	Eyi ni a ṣe ni ọna ti o nifẹ pupọ.
Only a few people do that.	Nikan diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ni o ṣe bẹ.
There is no reason to do so.	Ko si idi lati ṣe nibi.
They work well together.	Wọn ṣiṣẹ daradara papọ.
We've all met your tail.	A ti sọ gbogbo pade rẹ iru.
I alone cannot change the story.	Emi nikan ko le yi itan pada.
Experiment with them to see what works best.	Ṣe idanwo pẹlu wọn lati rii ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ julọ.
I returned home after doing the work.	Mo pada si ile lẹhin ṣiṣe iṣẹ naa.
I did not walk away.	Emi ko rin kuro.
What could be better!?.	Kini o le dara julọ!?.
My old houses with lots of old cars.	Awọn ile mi atijọ pẹlu ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ atijọ.
But it is a matter of time.	Sugbon o jẹ ọrọ kan ti akoko kan.
I have already written three times.	Mo ti kọ tẹlẹ ni igba mẹta.
Tell it.	So si o.
You know what you do.	O mọ ohun ti o ṣe.
I need to watch the game.	Mo nilo lati wo ere naa.
This can sometimes be seen in the eye.	Eyi le rii nigba miiran ni oju.
I have eaten in many restaurants.	Mo ti jẹun ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ile ounjẹ.
There is nothing else in the city.	Ko si ohun miiran ni ilu.
She looked at him.	O wo si ọdọ rẹ.
We will hit the boat and your house.	A yoo lu ọkọ oju omi ati ile rẹ.
He, in particular, decided to take it too.	Oun, paapaa, pinnu lati gba paapaa.
The device has many advantages.	Ẹrọ naa ni ọpọlọpọ awọn anfani.
He knew it was impossible.	O mọ pe ko ṣee ṣe.
You can get them.	O le gba wọn.
That is another thing you are right about.	Iyẹn jẹ ohun miiran ti o tọ nipa.
It drinks a lot of water in the summer.	O mu omi pupọ ninu ooru.
If you are there, read.	Ti o ba wa nibẹ, ka.
I mean there is.	Mo tumọ si pe o wa.
He says now is not a good time.	O sọ pe bayi kii ṣe akoko ti o dara.
We need to talk.	A nilo lati sọrọ.
They should be able to help you.	Wọn yẹ ki o ni anfani lati ran ọ lọwọ.
Ask everything you want.	Beere ohun gbogbo ti o fẹ.
I decided to get it back.	Mo pinnu lati gba a pada.
He killed himself.	O pa ara rẹ.
The band played late into the night.	Awọn iye dun pẹ sinu alẹ.
I can't live with myself.	Emi ko le gbe pẹlu ara mi.
One is that you go shopping from time immemorial.	Ọkan ni pe o lọ ra lati igba atijọ.
He decided to renovate the room.	O pinnu lati tun yara naa ṣe.
Read enough stuff and you will get used to it.	Ka awọn nkan ti o to ati pe iwọ yoo lo si rẹ.
Essentially, look now.	Ni pataki, wo ni bayi.
Think it is amazing.	Ronu pe o jẹ iyalẹnu.
We break into small groups.	A fọ sinu awọn ẹgbẹ kekere.
It seems.	O dabi.
I really like that.	Mo feran iyẹn gaan.
Let me start.	Jẹ ki n bẹrẹ.
You should apply to that advice.	O yẹ ki o lo si imọran naa.
I think you know it.	Mo ro pe o mọ rẹ.
But it seems.	Sugbon o dabi.
Now is our time, before we lose.	Bayi ni akoko wa, ṣaaju ki a to padanu.
There will be a big celebration.	Ayẹyẹ nla kan yoo wa.
Can you tell me what day it will work for you.	O le sọ fun mi kini ọjọ ti yoo ṣiṣẹ fun ọ.
Or maybe both.	Tabi boya mejeeji.
They tried a high.	Wọn gbiyanju a giga.
Do what you think is right.	Ṣe ohun ti o ro pe o tọ.
I couldn’t allow myself to think about it.	Emi ko le gba ara mi laaye lati ronu nipa rẹ.
Several hours of travel are required.	Awọn wakati pupọ ti irin-ajo ni a nilo.
Will return to your site again.	Yoo pada si aaye rẹ lẹẹkansi.
They made love for the first time.	Wọn ṣe ifẹ fun igba akọkọ.
Of course you can go to school.	Dajudaju o le lọ si ile-iwe.
With it, you never know.	Pẹlu rẹ, o ko mọ.
Do not put us that way.	Maṣe fi wa si ọna yẹn.
That should keep them safe.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o pa wọn mọ.
This bed is too small.	Ibusun yii kere ju.
It takes time, they say.	O gba akoko, wọn sọ.
He wanted street pictures.	O fe awọn aworan ita.
You know they are here.	O mọ pe wọn wa nibi kan.
It is a new time now.	O jẹ akoko tuntun ni bayi.
More now, even more so.	Diẹ sii ni bayi, paapaa ju iyẹn lọ.
Who can write like this?	Tani o le kọ bi eleyi?
Your body can improve.	Ara rẹ le dara si.
That is the understanding of things.	Iyẹn jẹ oye ohun.
Now we decide.	Bayi a pinnu.
Your job here is to help people.	Iṣẹ rẹ nibi ni ero lati ran eniyan lọwọ.
If your reason is true you will know it.	Ti o ba jẹ idi rẹ otitọ iwọ yoo mọ ọ.
And he was afraid.	Ati pe o bẹru.
I jumped to the end.	Mo fo si ipari.
Wonderful work! 	Iṣẹ iyanu!
The decision is yours.	Ipinnu naa jẹ tirẹ.
Never let up.	Ko jẹ ki soke.
And we want to talk to you.	Ati pe a fẹ lati ba ọ sọrọ.
He went back to his bed and turned off the lights.	O pada si ibusun rẹ o si pa awọn ina.
No one deserves that.	Ko si eniyan ti o tọ si iyẹn.
There are real people.	Awọn eniyan otitọ wa.
Not the top three.	Ko oke mẹta.
Do not let anyone else use it.	Maṣe jẹ ki ẹnikẹni miiran lo.
His eyes rested on her.	Oju rẹ duro lori rẹ.
And you will be there.	Ati pe iwọ yoo wa nibẹ.
He lives an hour away from the city.	O ngbe ni wakati kan lati ilu naa.
It was decided soon.	O ti pinnu laipẹ.
I need to spend some time learning more or understanding more.	Mo nilo lati lo akoko diẹ lati kọ ẹkọ diẹ sii tabi ni oye diẹ sii.
My dogs leave the house.	Awon aja mi kuro ni ile.
It is tough.	O le o.
Was in the room.	Wà ninu yara.
And he understood.	O si loye.
No one truly believes.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o gbagbọ ni otitọ.
Just happy to see you.	O kan dun lati ri ọ.
That however is not the only problem.	Iyẹn sibẹsibẹ kii ṣe iṣoro nikan.
Sure, the car is there.	Daju, ọkọ naa wa.
I took them.	Mo mu wọn.
This picture is in a friend's house.	Aworan yi wa ni ile ọrẹ kan.
You can do anything.	O le ṣe ohunkohun.
So, keep walking and learn to look back.	Nitorina, pa o rin o kọ lati wo ẹhin.
After that is now.	Lẹhin iyẹn ni bayi.
Everything tied down stays put.	Ohun gbogbo ti so si isalẹ duro fi.
Do this well.	Ṣe eyi daradara.
It was a wonderful time.	O je kan iyanu akoko.
Many are here who do not understand.	Ọpọlọpọ wa nibi ti ko ni oye.
But he stood his ground.	Ṣugbọn o duro ni ipo rẹ.
You may have been killed.	O le ti pa.
They make a good team.	Wọn ṣe ẹgbẹ ti o dara.
Anything we do is wrong.	Ohunkohun ti a ṣe jẹ aṣiṣe.
This will however appear below.	Eyi yoo sibẹsibẹ han ni isalẹ.
They have no eyes.	Wọn ko ni oju.
Everything goes to plan.	Ohun gbogbo lọ lati gbero.
Feeling and thinking.	Ohun ti o rilara ati ero.
And maybe you can.	Ati boya o le.
And in this we see one of those problems.	Ati ninu eyi a rii ọkan ninu awọn iṣoro naa.
We were around the same age.	A wà ni ayika kanna ori.
My only interest.	Anfani mi nikan.
You need to go your own way and be your own person.	O nilo lati lọ si ọna tirẹ ki o jẹ eniyan tirẹ.
It is a simple task.	O jẹ iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
You need to be at the top of everything from here to inside.	O nilo lati wa ni oke ti ohun gbogbo lati ibi lọ sinu.
We do this in many ways.	A ṣe eyi ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna.
The most likely mistakes are to be found here.	Awọn aṣiṣe ti o ṣeeṣe julọ wa lati wa nibi.
I just didn’t hear them.	Mo kan ko gbọ wọn.
The biggest problem, however, is not what you think it is.	Iṣoro nla julọ, sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe ohun ti o ro pe o jẹ.
It is the law.	Ofin ni.
This time he arrived.	Ni akoko yii o de ọdọ.
They don't want to do anything at all.	Wọn ko fẹ ṣe ohunkohun rara.
Find activities you enjoy.	Wa awọn iṣẹ ṣiṣe ti o gbadun.
I am here to hear why.	Mo wa nibi lati gbọ idi.
In just three days.	Ni o kan ọjọ mẹta.
This is completely wrong.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe patapata.
It bothers me.	O rẹ mi loju.
You never know what you'll get!	O ko mọ ohun ti o yoo gba!
What I do not know why.	Ohun ti ko mọ idi rẹ.
He killed her all the time.	O pa a ni gbogbo igba.
Let's put it like this.	Jẹ ká fi o bi yi.
But they are not fast enough.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko yara to.
But it will not come.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo wa.
At least at this point.	O kere ju ni aaye yii.
But he will learn to speak in time.	Ṣugbọn oun yoo kọ ẹkọ lati sọrọ ni akoko.
I'm not trying to find my mother.	Nko gbiyanju lati wa iya mi ri.
It doesn't seem to matter.	O dabi pe ko ṣe pataki.
No one is in sight.	Ko si ẹnikan ni oju.
He said nothing either.	Ko so nkankan boya.
I love both.	Mo nifẹ awọn mejeeji.
They can’t help you.	Wọn ko le ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ.
The bed has not been touched.	A ko ti fi ọwọ kan ibusun naa.
I'll call you today.	Emi yoo pe e loni.
I don't think it's right for that.	Emi ko ro pe o tọ fun iyẹn.
I just hate it when you do.	Mo kan korira rẹ nigbati o ṣe bẹ.
It makes you wonder why.	O jẹ ki o ṣe iyalẹnu idi.
I said he stood there.	Mo sọ pe o duro nibẹ.
Please call me.	Jọwọ pe mi ni.
I can't believe how small it is.	Emi ko le gbagbọ bi o ṣe kere to.
He hit me in the back of my head and legs.	O lu mi ni ẹhin ori ati ẹsẹ mi.
You already understand.	O ti loye tẹlẹ.
I don’t want to ever have to tell anyone.	Emi ko fẹ lati lailai ni lati so fun ẹnikẹni.
How highly expected.	Bawo ni o ṣe yẹ pupọ.
Everything is coming out now.	Ohun gbogbo ti n jade ni bayi.
One brother held his hand at one point.	Arakunrin kan ti mu ọwọ rẹ ni akoko kan.
They also sent it to me today.	Wọn tun fi ranṣẹ si mi loni.
That will keep us safe.	Iyẹn yoo pa wa mọ.
And with that he turned and walked out of the store.	Ati pẹlu eyi o yipada o si rin lati ile itaja.
It gives us what we need to know to work.	O fun wa ni ohun ti a nilo lati mọ lati ṣiṣẹ.
I would like the mother back with the baby.	Emi yoo fẹ ki iya naa pada pẹlu ọmọ naa.
I would sit and do nothing.	Emi yoo joko ko ṣe nkankan.
But it has to be.	Sugbon o ni lati wa.
I will contact you for the details.	Emi yoo kan fun awọn alaye naa.
Most women do not.	Pupọ awọn obinrin ko ni.
He did this kind of thing a lot.	O ṣe iru nkan yii pupọ.
No one did, however.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe, sibẹsibẹ.
Just come here to sleep.	Kan wa nibi lati sun.
Water is an important food for everyone.	Omi jẹ ounjẹ pataki fun gbogbo eniyan.
You get through.	O gba nipasẹ.
Find one at a time.	Wa ọkan ni akoko kan.
We have talked about this.	A ti sọrọ nipa eyi.
You have tried to call me.	O ti gbiyanju lati pe mi.
I will change, if you will.	Emi yoo yipada, ti o ba fẹ.
Not for a minute, for any reason.	Kii ṣe fun iṣẹju kan, fun eyikeyi idi.
I don’t think it will.	Emi ko ro pe o yoo.
He died this morning.	O ku ni owurọ yi.
You have to give one.	O ni lati fun ni ọkan.
I asked you what that should mean.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ kini iyẹn yẹ lati tumọ si.
He broke out of the room.	O ya jade kuro ninu yara naa.
And it's probably right.	Ati pe o ṣee ṣe pe o tọ.
They are all on it.	Gbogbo wọn wa lori rẹ.
Everyone knows that.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ pe.
We are not talking about anything personal other than that.	A ko sọrọ nipa ohunkohun ti ara ẹni ju iyẹn lọ.
We took that picture.	A gba aworan yẹn.
People can have any life they want.	Awọn eniyan le ni igbesi aye eyikeyi ti wọn fẹ.
It just came to me.	O kan wa si mi.
Not because he is.	Kii ṣe nitori pe oun ni.
You will complete all the questionnaires.	Iwọ yoo pari gbogbo awọn iwe ibeere.
You know better.	O mọ dara julọ.
But some of them do.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu wọn ṣe.
You know your situation.	O mọ ipo rẹ.
He did not say so.	Ko sọ bẹẹ.
You can do something like this.	O le ṣe nkan bi eyi.
This is a great choice with our family.	Eyi jẹ ayanfẹ nla pẹlu idile wa.
I am trying to find them.	Mo n gbiyanju lati wa wọn.
He never saw that place.	Ko ri ibi yẹn rara.
One love, many one.	Ifẹ kan, ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkan.
But not this woman.	Sugbon ko obinrin yi.
We have to write two.	A ni lati kọ meji.
This is your area.	Eyi ni agbegbe rẹ.
I did this myself.	Mo ti ṣe eyi funrararẹ.
Of course you know about it.	Dajudaju o mọ nipa rẹ.
It is not easy to leave.	Ko rọrun lati lọ kuro.
Maybe you don’t have to do anything.	Boya ko ni lati ṣe ohunkohun.
I picked up my phone.	Mo gbe foonu mi soke.
The game was up.	Awọn ere wà soke.

They read the story back.	Wọn ka itan sẹhin.
They may be of little help.	Wọn le jẹ ti iranlọwọ diẹ.

My kids really like it.	Awọn ọmọ mi fẹran rẹ gaan.
In a company.	Ninu ile-iṣẹ kan.
I just do not know how or why.	Mo kan ko mọ bii tabi idi.
It changed their whole lives.	O yi gbogbo aye wọn pada.
He did not want the cat to sleep with him.	Ko fe ki ologbo naa ba a sun.
It is understandable.	O jẹ oye.
Here is a way to think about it.	Eyi ni ọna lati ronu nipa rẹ.
The music today was amazing.	Awọn orin loni je iyanu.
The cause of the fire is still unknown.	Idi ti ina naa ko tii mọ.
I have a lot to learn from you.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ lati kọ ẹkọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
And it will not do anything.	Ati pe kii yoo ṣe ohunkohun.
They lose interest in what they have lost interest in.	Wọn padanu anfani ninu awọn ohun ti a ti padanu anfani ni.
What he is saying now.	Ohun ti o n sọ ni bayi.
But it works pretty much the same.	Ṣugbọn o ṣiṣẹ lẹwa ti o dara kan kanna.
We just look at each other.	A kan wo ara wa.
Opinions on all sides.	Awọn ero lori gbogbo ẹgbẹ.
A man.	Ọkunrin kan.
There is no job for you there.	Ko si iṣẹ fun ọ nibẹ.
He decided it was not possible.	O pinnu pe ko ṣee ṣe.
Where are they ?.	Nibo ni wọn wa?.
But he did not let his wife go.	Ṣugbọn ko jẹ ki iyawo rẹ lọ.
He arrived just in time to pick up the bus.	O de ni akoko kan lati gba ọkọ akero naa.
They find what they need in themselves.	Wọn wa ohun ti wọn nilo ninu ara wọn.
If there is one place, there may be others.	Ti aaye kan ba wa, awọn miiran le wa.
Maybe that's the only reason.	Boya iyẹn nikan ni idi.
It's going down.	O n lọ silẹ.
Your family does not know where you are.	Ebi re ko mo ibi ti o wa.
We almost ate.	A ti fẹrẹ jẹun.
He will go with you if you will.	Oun yoo lọ pẹlu rẹ ti o ba fẹ.
They love books and music.	Wọn nifẹ awọn iwe ati orin.
Who are they?	Tani won?
And not his mother.	Ati ki o ko si iya rẹ.
He wants you to believe.	O fẹ ki o gbagbọ.
I am not old, to begin with.	Emi ko ti atijọ, lati bẹrẹ pẹlu.
You will however need to do some work.	O yoo sibẹsibẹ nilo lati ṣe diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ.
No one tried to talk her out of it.	Ko si ọkan gbiyanju lati sọrọ rẹ jade ti o.
After a while they decided to sell them.	Lẹhin igba diẹ wọn pinnu lati ta wọn.
Not a hit at all.	Ko kan lu rara.
Not the house, but everything in it.	Kii ṣe ile, ṣugbọn gbogbo nkan ti o wa ninu rẹ.
Every mother is treated like this.	Gbogbo iya ni a ṣe bi eleyi.
However he was already here, it seemed.	Sibẹsibẹ o ti wa nibi tẹlẹ, o dabi enipe.
He brought me into music.	Oun ni o mu mi sinu orin.
We spent lunch at the beach.	A lo ọsan ni eti okun.
Something to eat.	Nkankan lati jẹ.
We should make a newspaper.	A yẹ ki o ṣe iwe iroyin kan.
We want better information.	A fẹ alaye to dara julọ.
I really like it.	Mo feran re gaan.
Build a fire.	Kọ ina.
And now that’s with me.	Ati ni bayi iyẹn pẹlu mi.
This is something that no one likes to do.	Eyi jẹ nkan ti ẹnikan ko nifẹ lati ṣe.
We'd both have to do it for a few days.	A fẹ mejeeji ni lati ṣe fun awọn ọjọ diẹ.
I make sure I don’t look back.	Mo rii daju pe emi ko wo ẹhin.
You have to give him space for that.	O ni lati fun u ni awọn aaye fun iyẹn.
More people will want to stay with you.	Awọn eniyan diẹ sii yoo fẹ lati duro pẹlu rẹ.
I will be with you before sunset.	Emi yoo wa pẹlu rẹ ṣaaju ki oorun to wọ.
Too late, too late, too late.	O pẹ ju, pẹ ju, pẹ ju.
Young people can always afford to buy cars.	Awọn ọdọ le nigbagbogbo ni anfani lati ra awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
I know it is.	Mo mọ pe o jẹ.
I do not expect we will.	Emi ko reti a yoo.
But, you can still.	Ṣugbọn, o tun le.
That is there.	Iyẹn wa nibẹ.
No one told me to go.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ fun mi lati lọ.
We will do so.	A yoo ṣe bẹ.
This, of course, is noteworthy.	Eyi, dajudaju, jẹ akiyesi.
I will not let it end this way.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki o pari ni ọna yii.
Maybe it's right.	Boya o tọ.
It was like a game.	O dabi iru ere kan.
Dogs are very loving.	Awọn aja jẹ ifẹ pupọ.
The inhabitants of this city enjoy the pleasant weather.	Awọn ti n gbe ni ilu yii gbadun oju ojo ti o dara.
I'm just thinking.	Mo n ronu nikan.
It is really helping at this point.	O ti wa ni ran gaan ni aaye yi.
In fact, it is very difficult.	Ni otitọ, o nira pupọ.
I can't keep it.	Nko le pa a mo.
I love you more than anything in this world.	Mo ni ife re ju ohunkohun ninu aye yi.
But maybe that was my fault.	Ṣugbọn boya iyẹn ni aṣiṣe mi.
So is yours, by the way.	Bẹẹ ni tirẹ, nipasẹ ọna.
They are a way to make power, more now than ever.	Wọn jẹ ọna lati ṣe agbara, diẹ sii ni bayi ju lailai.
Women love it.	Awọn obinrin fẹran rẹ.
That is possible now.	Wipe o ṣee ṣe ni bayi.
And up.	Ati si oke.
You are now logged out.	O ti yọ kuro ni bayi.
Maybe my wife.	Boya iyawo mi.
My whole life has been for you.	Gbogbo aye mi ti wa fun ọ.
The bride knows nothing about it.	Iyawo ko mọ nkankan nipa rẹ.
Thirty years before, perhaps.	Ọgbọn ọdun ṣaaju ki o to, boya.
I am fine.	Mo dara.
This is a hard journey.	Eyi jẹ irin-ajo lile.
Now, everyone else is seeing the same thing.	Bayi, gbogbo eniyan miiran n rii ohun kanna.
That sounds like a good place to start.	Iyẹn dabi ibi ti o dara lati bẹrẹ.
He closed his eyes.	O pa oju rẹ.
The car is also what it is.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa tun jẹ ohun ti o jẹ.
We do not know what happened to them.	A ko mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si wọn.
Things have to be handled properly.	Awọn nkan gbọdọ wa ni mimu daradara.
That is the problem.	Iyẹn ni iṣoro naa.
Time to wait.	Akoko lati duro.
Ro a dun hard.	Ro a dun lile.
You have to be with me.	O ni lati wa pẹlu mi.
It’s not that you have space to talk.	Kii ṣe pe o ni aye lati sọrọ.
Young girls are everywhere.	Awọn ọmọbirin ọdọ wa nibi gbogbo.
They are old and true friends.	Wọn jẹ ọrẹ atijọ ati otitọ.
That means they are also here.	Eyi tumọ si pe wọn tun wa nibi.
He tried very hard not to reach his pocket.	O gbiyanju pupọ lati ma de apo rẹ.
They love down here.	Wọn nifẹ si isalẹ nibi.
We didn’t do it this year because of his broken leg.	A ko ṣe ni ọdun yii nitori ẹsẹ rẹ ti o fọ.
Not for him.	Ko fun u.
Call the office if you want to buy some.	Pe ni ọfiisi ti o ba fẹ ra diẹ ninu.
But most of them do.	Ṣugbọn ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn ṣe.
Make yourself at home.	Ṣe ara rẹ ni ile.
The story is over.	Itan naa ti pari.
We know how important water is to life.	A mọ bi omi ṣe ṣe pataki si igbesi aye.
This seems too good to be true.	Eyi dabi ẹni pe o dara pupọ lati jẹ otitọ.
Maybe it will help me to understand even more.	Boya yoo ran mi lọwọ lati loye paapaa.
I asked my name for him.	Mo beere orukọ mi fun u.
I had no idea it had happened, and it was news to me.	Emi ko mọ pe o ti ṣẹlẹ, ati pe o jẹ iroyin fun mi.
I don't care.	Emi ko ṣe pataki.
Read the questions carefully.	Ka awọn ibeere daradara.
He concluded that it was not.	O pari pe kii ṣe.
My question stands for him in his songs.	Ibeere mi duro fun u ni awọn orin rẹ.
It should have been easier.	O yẹ ki o ti rọrun.
He knew his wife by first name.	O mọ iyawo rẹ nipa orukọ akọkọ.
So they stood there, in the water, in our water.	Nitorina wọn duro nibẹ, ninu omi, ninu omi wa.
Work done either or not.	Iṣẹ ti a boya ṣe tabi ko.
He is at home with his wife.	O wa ni ile pẹlu iyawo rẹ.
Or any kind of tree in sight.	Tabi eyikeyi iru igi ni oju.
For a few minutes they did not know, any of them, knew it.	Fun diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹju diẹ wọn ko mọ, eyikeyi ninu wọn, mọ ọ.
Okay, a couple of things.	O dara, awọn nkan meji kan.
I am happy to receive them.	Inu mi dun lati gba wọn.
It is a great idea to get these things.	O jẹ imọran nla lati gba nkan wọnyi.
You can not help yourself.	O ko le ran ara rẹ lọwọ.
He never talked about his family.	Ko sọrọ nipa idile rẹ rara.
I see that now.	Mo rii iyẹn ni bayi.
Go, therefore, through this method.	Lọ, nitorina, nipasẹ ọna yii.
Just wait for that.	Kan duro de iyẹn.
So men are.	Nitorina awọn ọkunrin jẹ.
I am asking you for something.	Mo n beere lọwọ rẹ fun nkankan.
I am here to talk to you.	Mo wa nibi lati ba ọ sọrọ.
They always work.	Wọn nigbagbogbo ṣiṣẹ.
The problem is that public buses are not enough.	Iṣoro naa ni pe awọn ọkọ akero ilu ko to.
To die.	Lati ku.
They decided to find a better life.	Wọn pinnu lati wa igbesi aye ti o dara julọ.
Some people use the first world they get.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan lo aye akọkọ ti wọn gba.
You have won.	O ti gba.
Come home and talk to me.	Wa si ile ki o ba mi sọrọ.
Go and pick up the seats.	Lọ ki o si gbe awọn ijoko.
The sister was less than expected.	Arabinrin naa kere ju bi o ti reti lọ.
There are two other brothers.	Awọn arakunrin meji miiran wa.
The little boy was jumping up and down.	Ọmọkunrin kekere naa n fo soke ati isalẹ.
Okay, at least you’ve seen it before.	O dara, o kere ju ti o ti ri i tẹlẹ.
He asked her to repeat the story.	O beere lọwọ rẹ lati tun itan naa ṣe.
It does not become a mistake.	Ko di aṣiṣe.
To this day we do.	Titi di oni a ṣe.
You have enough money to just travel.	O ni owo ti o to lati kan rin irin-ajo.
Maybe he did the whole thing.	Boya o ṣe gbogbo nkan naa.
You also want that power.	O tun fẹ agbara yẹn.
You do not know what it is about yet.	Iwọ ko mọ ohun ti o jẹ nipa sibẹsibẹ.
There are so many of them in everyone.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn mejeeji wa ninu gbogbo eniyan.
Do not leave the house when you feel that way.	Maṣe jade kuro ni ile nigbati o ba ni imọran bẹ.
This understanding makes the wife an instrument for her husband.	Oye yii jẹ ki iyawo jẹ ohun elo fun ọkọ rẹ.
You see a doctor on the doctor's advice.	O ri dokita lori imọran dokita.
I worked with him.	Mo ti ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
Okay, maybe.	O dara, boya.
But he just laughed.	Ṣugbọn o rẹrin nikan.
We want to see it happen.	A fẹ lati rii pe o ṣẹlẹ.
So maybe there is something in it.	Nitorina boya nkan kan wa ninu rẹ.
I have seen it.	Mo ti ri i.
He did it again.	O tun ṣe.
This is a very simple task.	Eyi jẹ iṣẹ ṣiṣe ti o rọrun pupọ.
But that did not convince him.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko da a loju.
Her parents are very sad.	Awọn obi rẹ jẹ gidigidi.
But he wants to kill you badly.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ lati pa ọ ni buburu.
Not much of a head.	Ko Elo ti a ori.
Two small tables with two small chairs.	Awọn tabili kekere meji pẹlu awọn ijoko kekere meji.
He would just not do it.	Oun yoo kan ko ṣe.
But you haven’t heard from in a few weeks.	Ṣugbọn o ko ti gbọ lati ọsẹ diẹ.
We don’t need to do anything in it.	A ko nilo lati ṣe nkan kan ninu rẹ.
None of the groups.	Ko si ẹniti awọn ẹgbẹ.
It does every year.	O ṣe ni gbogbo ọdun.
We were upset about wearing clothes on school days.	A binu lori wọ aṣọ ni awọn ọjọ ile-iwe.
You don't really need me.	Iwọ ko nilo mi gaan.
One summer, it may not be.	Ni igba ooru kan, ko le jẹ.
I like it.	Mo feran re.
I will swim back to you soon.	Emi yoo we pada si ọ laipẹ.
He really looks good.	O si gan wo ti o dara.
He stole me.	O ti ji mi gbe.
I don't know what that thing is.	Emi ko mọ kini nkan naa jẹ.
The reason is simple, and more beautiful, than that.	Idi naa rọrun, ati diẹ sii lẹwa, ju iyẹn lọ.
Something that cannot be explained.	Nkankan ti a ko le ṣe alaye.
It means a lot.	O tumọ si pupọ.
It costs money, nothing more than to leave town.	O ni owo, ko si ohun miiran ju lati lọ kuro ni ilu.
However, that is also a problem.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn tun jẹ iṣoro.
You cannot view the boxes and do not open them.	O ko le wo awọn apoti ati ki o ko ṣi wọn.
I don’t see what happened to them.	Emi ko rii ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si wọn.
Of course, he could not hear me.	Dajudaju, ko le gbọ mi.
Nothing was ever heard of either man again.	Ko si ohun ti a lailai gbọ ti boya ọkunrin lẹẹkansi.
Well, he didn't.	O dara, ko ṣe bẹ.
I don’t just think of it.	Emi ko kan ro ero rẹ.
He will not look at me.	Ko ni wo mi.
You know everything.	O mọ ohun gbogbo.
Get off the road.	Lọ kuro ni opopona.
He stopped at first and listened.	O duro ni akọkọ o si gbọ.
We allow ourselves to draw in as well.	A gba ara wa laaye lati fa sinu bi daradara.
We will not accept.	A yoo gba rara.
Year ends and new begins.	Odun pari ati tuntun bẹrẹ.
They found themselves there.	Wọn ri ara wọn nibẹ.
Where are you when he is not with you.	Nibo ni o wa nigbati ko si pẹlu rẹ.
My mother went there.	Iya mi lọ nibẹ.
A man was sitting in the car.	Ọkunrin kan joko ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
Dude, you're out.	Arakunrin, o ti jade.
He stays here.	O duro nibi.
That’s what started things, but that’s not it.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti bẹrẹ awọn nkan, ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe.
No one knows why.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ idi.
It seems that there is only this idea.	O dabi pe o wa nikan ni imọran yii.
That is not enough.	Wipe rara ko to.
This time it did not go well.	Ni akoko yii ko lọ daradara.
Its systems are not over yet.	Awọn ọna ṣiṣe rẹ ko ti pẹ.
It can't mean anything.	Ko le tumọ si nkankan.
He is my favorite student.	O jẹ ọmọ ile-iwe ayanfẹ mi.
Maybe not everywhere.	Boya kii ṣe nibi gbogbo.
Sometimes the best thing to do is to do nothing.	Nigba miiran ohun ti o dara julọ lati ṣe ni lati ṣe ohunkohun.
Because in my heart we are one and the same.	Nitori ninu ọkan mi a jẹ ọkan ati kanna.
You just have to know where to look.	O kan ni lati mọ ibiti o ti wo.
He will sleep for another hour.	Yoo wa sun fun wakati miiran.
My son is right.	Ọmọ mi tọ.
But his body did on his own.	Ṣugbọn ara rẹ ṣe lori ara rẹ.
Got up in a few things.	Ti gba soke ni kan diẹ ohun.
Home or office, it doesn’t matter.	Ile tabi ọfiisi, ko ṣe pataki.
He did it again.	O tun ṣe.
The reasons for this are not clear.	Awọn idi fun eyi ko ṣe akiyesi.
It may not be possible, but it does happen.	O le ma ṣee ṣe, ṣugbọn o ṣẹlẹ.
And for this job you need a person.	Ati fun iṣẹ yii o nilo eniyan kan.
He went everywhere with my father.	O si lọ nibi gbogbo pẹlu baba mi.
He became a man of thought.	O di eniyan ti ero kan.
He just wanted to talk to her.	O fe nikan lati ba a sọrọ.
However, this story is irrelevant.	Sibẹsibẹ, itan yii ko ṣe pataki.
Everyone helps a lot.	Gbogbo eniyan ṣe iranlọwọ pupọ.
Give me an hour, okay?	Fun mi ni wakati kan, o dara?
They use that.	Wọn lo iyẹn.
He worked in a small company in the city.	O ṣiṣẹ ni ile-iṣẹ kekere kan ni ilu naa.
His only strength is handicrafts.	Agbara rẹ nikan ni iṣẹ ọwọ.
Respect everyone.	Fi ọwọ fun gbogbo eniyan.
I wish you could read this.	Mo fẹ pe o le ka eyi.
Everyone has problems.	Gbogbo eniyan ni awọn iṣoro.
He is not good enough.	Oun ko dara to.
It is too hot to sit outside in the sun.	O gbona ju lati joko ni ita ni oorun.
I saw this with my own eyes and it did, especially.	Mo ti ri eyi pẹlu oju mi ​​ati pe o ṣe, paapaa.
Anything but this.	Ohunkohun sugbon yi.
Love the information.	Nifẹ alaye naa.
They have no children together.	Wọn ko ni ọmọ papọ.
It sounds.	O dun.
For the same reason.	Fun idi kanna.
Last application.	Ohun elo to kẹhin.
But for him it has to be true.	Ṣugbọn fun u o ni lati jẹ otitọ.
I hope you are doing well.	Mo nireti pe o n ṣe daradara.
He spent a lot of time on his own.	O lo akoko pupọ pupọ fun ara rẹ.
However, it may not rain a lot.	Sibẹsibẹ, o le ma ojo kan pupo.
In the end, only time will tell.	Ni ipari, akoko nikan yoo sọ.
They must be.	Gbọdọ ni wọn.
We have bodies, but we are not bodies.	A ni ara, sugbon a wa ni ko ara.
They are the only women they want.	Wọn jẹ awọn obinrin nikan ti wọn fẹ.
You do not have to remember anything.	O ko ni lati ranti ohunkohun.
The children are late for school.	Awọn ọmọ ti pẹ fun ile-iwe.
He left her.	O fi i silẹ.
And there is nothing in it.	Ati pe ko si nkankan ninu rẹ.
I did not keep any of those letters.	Emi ko tọju eyikeyi ninu awọn lẹta yẹn.
Sure enough to hear from you.	O daju pe o dara lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
This will make it easier to do.	Eyi yoo rọrun diẹ sii ti o ṣe.
And this is it.	Ati pe eyi ni.
You don’t want to be a boatman.	O ko fẹ lati jẹ eniyan ọkọ oju omi.
At least for me it is.	O kere ju fun mi o jẹ.
I look forward to my back with love too.	Mo nireti ẹhin mi pẹlu ifẹ paapaa.
I was very happy to get out of such a house.	Inu mi dun pupọ lati jade kuro ni iru ile kan.
You must have had an eye for it.	O gbọdọ ti ni ohun oju fun o.
Buy this book.	Ra iwe yi.
They are not feet outside.	Wọn kii ṣe ẹsẹ ni ita.
And just look at how no one gives this a thought.	Ati ki o kan wo bi ko si ọkan yoo fun yi a ero.
It is best to just contract them for the same service.	Dara julọ lati kan ṣe adehun wọn fun iṣẹ kan naa.
It starts with a lot of energy, great songs.	O bẹrẹ pẹlu agbara pupọ, awọn orin nla.
I miss you so much.	Mo padanu re pupo.
Maybe it was.	Boya ti jẹ.
I do not have to be afraid again.	Emi ko ni lati bẹru lẹẹkansi.
It has won a lot.	Ti gba pupọ rẹ.
But this situation is beyond me.	Ṣugbọn ipo yii kọja mi.
They have an agreement.	Won ni adehun.
You think you know what to expect.	O ro pe o mọ kini lati reti.
He added.	O fi kun.
Use "you" when talking about other people.	Lo "iwọ" nigbati a n sọrọ nipa eniyan miiran.
Making them vulnerable to injuries.	Ṣiṣe wọn jẹ ipalara si awọn ipalara.
He got up from the room.	O dide kuro ni yara naa.
People everywhere can benefit from this.	Awọn eniyan nibi gbogbo le ni anfani lati eyi.
There is little we can do about that right now.	Diẹ diẹ wa ti a le ṣe nipa iyẹn ni bayi.
Not enough.	Ko to.
For two years now.	Fun ọdun meji bayi.
Makes it easy to clean.	Mu ki o rọrun lati nu.
I bought a few things.	Mo ra awọn nkan diẹ.
They decided that someone should do it.	Wọn pinnu pe ẹnikan yẹ ki o ṣe.
Not there.	Ko si nibẹ.
They are key.	Wọn jẹ bọtini.
Was not around the room as much.	Je ko ni ayika yara bi Elo.
I will not worry.	Emi kii yoo ṣe aniyan.
We talk about it often and hope you will visit.	A n sọrọ nipa rẹ nigbagbogbo ati nireti pe iwọ yoo ṣabẹwo.
I went to get your drink.	Mo lọ gba ohun mimu rẹ.
He walked towards the river.	O rin si ọna odo odo.
And, things change over time.	Ati pe, awọn nkan yipada ni akoko pupọ.
If we make a mistake, there is no harm.	Ti a ba ṣe aṣiṣe, ko si ipalara kankan.
Sorry to hear about your problems.	Ma binu lati gbọ nipa awọn iṣoro rẹ.
So hard.	Nitorina lile.
You just can’t handle yourself to let it go.	O kan ko le mu ara rẹ lati jẹ ki o lọ.
My children, too.	Awọn ọmọ mi, paapaa.
I have seen some certainty.	Mo ti ri diẹ ninu awọn dajudaju.
They are not classes.	Wọn kii ṣe awọn kilasi.
We note.	A ṣe akiyesi.
Why he is talking, he does not know.	Kini idi ti o fi n sọrọ, ko mọ.
I want your opinion.	Mo fe ero yin.
We are here.	A ti wa nibi.
Do not read too much into it.	Maṣe ka pupọ sinu rẹ.
Just start to write something.	O kan bẹrẹ lati kọ nkan kan.
Something separates me from other people.	Nkankan ya mi kuro lati awọn eniyan miiran.
However it can be done.	Sibẹsibẹ o le ṣee ṣe.
It is not possible for such a world.	O ko le ṣee ṣe fun iru aye bẹẹ.
You will not hear from me anymore.	Iwọ kii yoo gbọ ti mi mọ.
And we go.	Ati ki a lọ.
Most people are hurt.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni ipalara.
So zero out the last two.	Nitorina odo jade awọn ti o kẹhin meji.
And for the man.	Ati fun ọkunrin naa.
I get your high position.	Mo gba ipo giga rẹ.
After a few minutes, it changed.	Lẹhin iṣẹju diẹ, o yipada.
He did not return anything.	Ko da nkankan pada.
Obviously they are also in love.	O han gbangba pe wọn tun wa ninu ifẹ.
There is so much they can get into that can hurt them.	Nibẹ ni ki Elo ti won le gba sinu ti o le ipalara wọn.
They really have the same look.	Wọn gan ni oju kanna.
I have it.	Mo ni o ni.
You just need to believe.	O nilo lati gbagbọ nikan.
I have not done with it yet.	Emi ko tii ṣe pẹlu rẹ sibẹsibẹ.
You will return.	Iwọ yoo pada.
It was a promise.	O je kan ileri.
It makes me feel.	O jẹ ki n lero.
So you may want to buy one.	Nitorina o le fẹ lati ra ọkan.
I can't tell you anything.	Nko le so nkankan fun yin.
The last.	Ti o kẹhin.
You have seen them.	O ti ri wọn.
I have closed my eyes.	Mo ti di oju mi.
It did not happen.	Ko ṣẹlẹ.
I missed it on the way.	Mo padanu rẹ loju ọna.
They don’t even have ideas.	Wọn ko paapaa awọn ero.
I have heard both.	Mo ti gbọ mejeeji.
My mother took them from me as well.	Iya mi ti gba wọn lọwọ mi pẹlu.
She looks like a beautiful girl living on her own.	O dabi ọmọbirin ti o dara ti o ngbe lori ara rẹ.
Why do you have to hurt every time you eat.	Kini idi ti o ni lati ṣe ipalara ni gbogbo igba ti o jẹun.
This is in fact a life picture.	Eyi jẹ ni otitọ aworan igbesi aye.
Carry out again.	Gbe jade lẹẹkansi.
After class, all students go to the store.	Lẹhin kilasi, gbogbo awọn ọmọ ile-iwe lọ si ile itaja.
This can happen in several ways.	Eyi le ṣẹlẹ ni awọn ọna pupọ.
Proceed with your own work.	Tẹsiwaju pẹlu iṣẹ tirẹ.
Last night, three times.	Ni alẹ kẹhin, igba mẹta.
Or less as needed.	Tabi kere si bi o ṣe nilo.
Three weeks without them is very good.	Ọsẹ mẹta laisi wọn dara pupọ.
He was the one who made those until he passed away.	Oun ni ẹni ti o ṣe awọn yẹn titi o fi kọja lọ.
We lost something we could never have again.	A padanu nkankan ti a le ko ni lẹẹkansi.
The girl put her head on the table.	Ọmọbirin naa fi ori rẹ silẹ lori tabili.
To let you know when you will be home.	Lati jẹ ki o mọ nigbati o yoo wa ni ile.
I just didn’t pick up.	Mo kan ko gbe soke.
She's a good girl, she said.	O jẹ ọmọbirin ti o dara, o sọ.
There is not really much to put.	Nibẹ ni ko gan Elo ju fi.
But he wanted them.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ wọn.
It was great to have her back.	O je nla lati ni rẹ pada.
But not in this way.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ni ọna yii.
But he was there.	Ṣugbọn o wa nibẹ.
I think you are too.	Mo ro pe iwọ naa jẹ.
For food, or buy snacks.	Fun ounjẹ, tabi ra awọn ounjẹ ounjẹ.
So we changed them to this idea.	Nitorina a yi wọn pada si imọran yii.
Just continue about love and stuff.	O kan tẹsiwaju nipa ifẹ ati nkan.
They expect now.	Wọn reti bayi.
Dog up the tree.	Aja soke igi.
They have a lot to learn from each other.	Wọn ni ọpọlọpọ lati kọ ẹkọ lati ọdọ ara wọn.
It depends on the question and in particular your work.	O da lori ibeere ati ni pataki iṣẹ rẹ.
It seemed impossible.	O dabi enipe ko ṣeeṣe.
Look at them.	Wo wọn.
I do not have much interest.	Emi ko ni anfani ni Elo.
We can write a letter to him.	A le kọ lẹta kan fun u.
Kan kun.	Kan kun.
The sister said nothing.	Arabinrin naa ko sọ ohunkohun.
It is a very serious injury.	O jẹ ipalara ti o ṣe pataki gaan.
You do not want to go now.	O ko fẹ ki o lọ ni bayi.
They are a month old today and they are doing well.	Wọn ti bi oṣu kan loni ati pe wọn n ṣe daradara.
So we do not.	Nitorina a ko.
I'm glad they both died.	Inu mi dun pe awon mejeeji ti ku.
Such sweet little houses.	Iru awọn ile kekere ti o dun.
A place where they feel at home.	A ibi ti won lero ni ile.
Tell him everything you need to tell him.	Sọ ohun gbogbo ti o nilo lati sọ fun u.
It does not matter much.	Ko ṣe pataki pupọ.
They fear this may be the last time.	Wọn bẹru pe eyi le jẹ akoko ikẹhin.
We have used both for a long time.	A ti lo mejeeji fun igba pipẹ.
But sometimes it just happens.	Sugbon nigba miiran ti o kan ṣẹlẹ.
You do not need to worry.	O ko nilo lati ṣe aniyan.
You do not have much time.	O ko ni akoko pupọ.
Everyone thought he just died in his sleep that night.	Gbogbo eniyan ro pe o kan ku ninu oorun rẹ ni alẹ yẹn.
Learn how it works.	Ko bi o ti ṣiṣẹ mọ.
It helps to write something out.	O ṣe iranlọwọ lati kọ nkan jade.
It’s the way you live.	O jẹ ọna ti o gbe.
I really need that.	Mo nilo iyẹn gaan.
They can go both ways.	Wọn le lọ ni ọna mejeeji.
He seemed annoyed by the question.	O dabi ẹni pe o binu nipasẹ ibeere naa.
He shook his head, and turned.	O mi ori, o si yipada.
But they are small.	Ṣugbọn wọn kere.
And it's not.	Ati awọn ti o ni ko.
We will of course be back to play again.	A yoo dajudaju pada wa lati mu ṣiṣẹ lẹẹkansi.
I also know something about you.	Mo tun mọ nkan nipa tirẹ.
But that is not your problem.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe iṣoro rẹ.
And I promise he will help you as he helped me.	Ati pe mo ṣe ileri pe oun yoo ran ọ lọwọ bi o ṣe ran mi lọwọ.
I think you are doing a very good job.	Mo ro pe o n ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara pupọ.
And maybe they deserve to do so.	Ati boya wọn tọ lati ṣe bẹ.
It sounds	O dun
We should do that.	A yẹ ki o ṣe iyẹn.
The sister is fine.	Arabinrin naa dara.
Which can mean only one thing.	Eyi ti o le tumọ ohun kan nikan.
He will not go out of his way to help them.	Oun ko ni jade ni ọna rẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun wọn.
Such as you.	Iru bi iwọ.
But the price does not matter.	Ṣugbọn owo naa ko ṣe pataki.
Get over it and move on with your life.	Gba lori rẹ ki o tẹsiwaju pẹlu igbesi aye rẹ.
Leave your room and be with me.	Fi yara rẹ silẹ ki o si wa pẹlu mi.
Do not, or it is finished.	Maṣe ṣe, tabi o ti pari.
I wrote a letter to them.	Mo kọ lẹta kan si wọn.
I have no place to ask you at all.	Emi ko ni aye lati beere lọwọ rẹ rara.
It's as good as it gets now.	O ti dara bayi bi ọrọ rẹ.
It is best not to wake the baby at night.	O dara ki a ma ji ọmọ naa ni alẹ.
All you need is your watch back.	Gbogbo ohun ti o fẹ ni aago rẹ pada.
It may be my imagination.	O le jẹ oju inu mi.
Get out of the question.	Jade kuro ninu ibeere.
I have to go meet only groups of people.	Mo ni lati lọ pade awọn ẹgbẹ eniyan nikan.
You know what to paint.	O mọ kini lati kun.
The heat also made me happy.	Ooru naa tun mu inu mi dun.
But you have to do a lot.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati ṣe pupọ.
We went outside and talked for a few minutes.	A lọ si ita ati sọrọ fun iṣẹju diẹ.
And so it began.	Ati bẹ bẹ bẹrẹ.
They know where they are from.	Wọn mọ ibi ti wọn ti wa.
Few people know who my family is.	Awọn eniyan diẹ ni o mọ ẹni ti idile mi jẹ.
You should stay with me.	O yẹ ki o duro pẹlu mi.
I would not like to come.	Emi kii yoo fẹ lati wa si.
Let me ask for another place for you.	Jẹ ki n beere aaye miiran fun ọ.
Nothing can be done about it.	Ko si ohun ti a le ṣe nipa rẹ.
You may not remember something as simple as my meeting for dinner.	O ko le ranti ohun ti o rọrun bi ipade mi fun ounjẹ alẹ.
I'm making sure.	Mo n rii daju pe.
Sit up at a table.	Joko soke ni a tabili.
It was small but clean.	O je kekere sugbon o mọ.
His eyes did not see.	Oju re ko ri.
If you have to.	Ti o ba ni lati.
That sounds good to me.	Iyẹn dara pẹlu mi.
This will not be easy to understand alone.	Eyi kii yoo rọrun lati ni oye nikan.
Today you should drink tea.	Loni o yẹ lati mu tii.
Well, the fact is that it will probably last forever.	O dara, otitọ ni pe o ṣee ṣe yoo wa titi lailai.
I try to remember.	Mo gbiyanju lati ranti.
There is nothing more than that.	Ko si nkankan ju iyẹn lọ.
It is only true.	O jẹ otitọ nikan.
And that is the key.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ bọtini.
He will eat me tea.	Oun yoo jẹ mi ni tii.
Maybe most don’t.	Boya pupọ julọ ko ṣe.
She has an amazing face.	O ni oju iyalẹnu.
You can’t have it all.	O ko le ni gbogbo rẹ.
Good friend, too.	Ọrẹ to dara, paapaa.
You just want to see it.	O kan fẹ lati wo o.
These things women do not do.	Awọn nkan wọnyi ni awọn obinrin ko ṣe.
Leave any plans for this year.	Fi eto eyikeyi silẹ fun ọdun yii.
Nothing less.	Ko si ohun ti o kere ju.
Today, we know a lot more.	Loni, a mọ pupọ diẹ sii.
But there may be other reasons.	Ṣugbọn awọn idi miiran le wa.
But it can't be done like this.	Sugbon ko le ṣee ṣe bi yi.
I have a wonderful family.	Mo ni idile iyanu.
He could not do it himself.	Ko le ṣe funrararẹ.
It sounds wrong.	O dun aṣiṣe.
She is a wonderful girl.	O jẹ ọmọbirin iyanu.
Not after what they did to me.	Ko lẹhin ohun ti wọn ṣe si mi.
That’s why we have a job.	Ti o ni idi ti a ni ise kan.
We will not be there in time if we do this!	A kii yoo wa nibẹ ni akoko ti a ba ṣe eyi!
I just need to get out.	Mo kan nilo lati gba jade.
I am not.	Emi ko je.
If you read, you will gain a new understanding.	Ti o ba ka, iwọ yoo ni oye tuntun.
He will be home in a week.	Oun yoo wa ni ile ni ọsẹ kan.
It may not be easy, but it is possible.	O le ma rọrun, ṣugbọn o le ṣee ṣe.
They do everything that everyone wants to hear.	Wọn ṣe ohun gbogbo ti gbogbo eniyan fẹ lati gbọ.
I like that you are not afraid to show your face.	Mo fẹran pe o ko bẹru lati fi oju rẹ han.
Of course you can.	Dajudaju o le.
And not because it’s easy.	Ati pe kii ṣe nitori pe o rọrun.
I can't write anymore.	Emi ko le kọ mọ.
For a few weeks he did nothing.	Fun awọn ọsẹ diẹ ko ṣe ohunkohun.
Just move on with life.	Kan tẹsiwaju pẹlu igbesi aye.
That is completely true.	Iyẹn jẹ otitọ patapata.
Something he said and he said he did not say.	Ohun kan ni o sọ ati pe o sọ pe ko sọ.
Never expect to see any of them again.	Ko nireti lati ri eyikeyi ninu wọn lẹẹkansi.
Take a moment to think about this yourself.	Gba akoko kan lati ronu nipa eyi funrararẹ.
Eventually the driver bought him breakfast at a restaurant.	Ni ipari awakọ naa ra ounjẹ owurọ fun u ni ile ounjẹ kan.
Not in my name !.	Ko si ni orukọ mi!.
Everything in the details.	Ohun gbogbo ninu awọn alaye.
That’s not good for anyone, none of us.	Iyẹn ko dara fun ẹnikẹni, ko si ọkan ninu wa.
Do not leave the store alone.	Maṣe jẹ ki o lọ kuro ni ile itaja nikan.
This is not your job.	Eyi kii ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
I haven't seen him since, and I don't want to.	Emi ko tii ri i lati igba naa, ati pe emi ko fẹ lati.
He sat next to me.	O joko nitosi mi.
But he goes on to say.	Ṣugbọn o tẹsiwaju lati sọ.
Some do well.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣe daradara.
Don't even remember that.	Ko paapaa ranti pe.
Call me in a year.	Pe mi ni odun kan.
I have done so myself.	Mo ti ṣe bẹ funrararẹ.
No one can say anything to any of us.	Ko si ẹniti o le sọ ohunkohun fun ẹnikẹni ninu wa.
You have talked to him.	O ti ba a sọrọ.
They don’t have to be good at it.	Wọn ko ni lati dara ni rẹ.
I don’t think it will be possible for me.	Emi ko ro pe yoo ṣee ṣe fun mi.
Walk with me.	Ba mi rin.
I could see that much.	Mo ti le ri wipe Elo.
You will not catch on.	O yoo ko yẹ lori.
But they are not there now.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko wa nibẹ ni bayi.
I will not ask for help or stuff.	Emi kii yoo beere fun iranlọwọ tabi awọn nkan.
But you have to have the right time.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati ni akoko to tọ.
Today you are in it.	Loni o wa ninu rẹ.
But it should not be yours.	Ṣugbọn ko yẹ ki o jẹ tirẹ.
Do no more to talk or to listen or to think.	Ma ṣe diẹ sii lati sọrọ tabi lati gbọ tabi lati ronu.
Use time well, do one thing at a time.	Lo akoko daradara, ṣe ohun kan ni akoko kan.
Never say Never.	Ko si ohun ti ko ṣee ṣe.
More to the story, more to him.	Diẹ sii si itan naa, diẹ sii fun u.
Please contact us here.	Jọwọ kan si wa nibi.
This method is very simple.	Ọna yii rọrun pupọ.
But the roof is gone.	Ṣugbọn ori ile ti lọ.
Try to make two applications.	Gbiyanju lati ṣe awọn ohun elo meji.
They laughed together.	Wọn rẹrin papọ.
He promised to receive a letter from his father.	O ṣe ileri lati gba lẹta kan lati ọdọ baba rẹ.
So we have to do the right thing.	Nitorina a gbọdọ ṣe nkan ti o tọ.
And look at them.	Ati ki o wo wọn.
You know your company better than anyone else.	O mọ ile-iṣẹ rẹ dara julọ ju ẹnikẹni miiran lọ.
They have been removed.	Wọn ti yọ kuro.
It is a very important thing.	O jẹ nkan pataki pupọ.
Such a story should not be told now.	Iru itan bẹẹ ko yẹ ki o sọ ni bayi.
You know why.	O mọ idi.
Anyone can write, they say.	Ẹnikẹni le kọ, wọn sọ.
The work has been friendly.	Iṣẹ naa ti jẹ ọrẹ.
That has also happened yet.	Iyẹn tun ti ṣẹlẹ sibẹsibẹ.
The meal was long, but the group enjoyed themselves.	Ounjẹ naa ti pẹ, ṣugbọn ẹgbẹ naa gbadun ara wọn.
I think for him it was a missed opportunity.	Mo ro pe fun u o jẹ anfani ti o padanu.
Well read something you think is important.	Dara ka nkan ti o ro pe o ṣe pataki.
You did not call me.	O ko pe mi.
You can let it out.	O le jẹ ki o jade.
Let the matter go down.	Jẹ ki ọrọ naa lọ silẹ.
That is some of them, if their eyes are open.	Diẹ ninu wọn niyẹn, ti oju wọn ba yẹ.
Often, however, we have the wrong impression.	Nigbagbogbo, sibẹsibẹ, a ni imọran ti ko tọ.
All lights work.	Gbogbo awọn ina ṣiṣẹ.
He could not.	Ko le ṣe.
And he sold out.	O si ta jade.
Of course it is beautiful, but it has nothing to do at all.	Dajudaju o lẹwa, ṣugbọn ko ni nkankan lati ṣe rara.
I could be that person.	Mo le jẹ eniyan yẹn.
We love both.	A nifẹ awọn mejeeji.
It was time for him to go.	O to akoko fun u lati lọ.
I am doing so.	Mo n ṣe bẹ.
I know your names.	Mo mọ awọn orukọ rẹ.
I take advantage of your company.	Mo gba awọn anfani ile-iṣẹ rẹ.
He asked you to change.	O beere pe ki o yipada pada.
Many of them say the same thing.	Pupọ ninu wọn sọ ohun kanna.
I do not know how they live there.	Emi ko mọ bi wọn ṣe n gbe laaye nibẹ.
A little, but enough to know that you can live.	Diẹ, ṣugbọn o to lati mọ pe o le gbe.
And you won't either.	Ati awọn ti o yoo ko boya.
The industry is clean.	Awọn ile ise jẹ mọ.
It was great to see.	O je nla lati ri.
He hopes to find the kitten any time now.	O nireti lati wa ọmọ ologbo naa ni akoko eyikeyi bayi.
The community wants to deal with it.	Agbegbe fẹ lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
Wear your shoes.	Wọ bata rẹ.
You need to come to terms with this.	O nilo lati wa si awọn ofin pẹlu eyi.
Two of them are very important.	Meji ninu wọn jẹ pataki pataki.
He refused to believe the report.	O kọ lati gbagbọ iroyin naa.
For some reason he stopped me.	Fun idi kan ti o da mi duro.
Good to hear from you.	O dara lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
Tell them you did what they said.	Sọ fun wọn pe o ṣe ohun ti wọn sọ.
So you have to make a decision.	Nitorina o ni lati ṣe ipinnu.
They were allowed to re-celebrate.	Wọn gba wọn laaye lati tun ṣe ayẹyẹ.
You can go both ways on this one.	O le lọ ni ọna mejeeji lori eyi.
Change the name.	Yi orukọ pada.
If you only knew, you would not say so.	Ti o ba mọ nikan, iwọ kii yoo sọ bẹ.
They will talk and hope it happens.	Wọn yoo sọrọ ati nireti pe o ṣẹlẹ.
I am fine.	Mo dara.
I do not have many friends.	Emi ko ni awọn ọrẹ pupọ.
They look at you.	Wọn wo ọ.
I think a lot of people do.	Mo ro pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan ṣe.
How many people live here?	Eniyan melo lo ngbe nibi?
That's what you see.	Ohun ti o rii niyẹn.
It will be hard for me, if you come back here.	Yoo le fun mi, ti o ba pada wa nibi.
It's getting hot.	O ti n gbona.
I found them helpful.	Mo rii wọn ṣe iranlọwọ.
He asked for my name.	O beere fun orukọ mi.
And it is true.	Ati pe o jẹ otitọ.
None of these things live.	Ko si ọkan ninu nkan wọnyi ti n gbe.
I never came back with it.	Emi ko pada pẹlu rẹ.
But today is not a good day.	Ṣugbọn loni kii ṣe ọjọ ti o dara.
You will need to go by bus.	Iwọ yoo nilo lati lọ nipasẹ ọkọ akero.
You wonder if you should get help.	O ro boya o yẹ ki o gba iranlọwọ.
He does so here at least.	O ṣe bẹ nibi o kere ju.
That's when it happened.	Ti o ni nigbati o ṣẹlẹ.
I can understand it.	Mo le ni oye rẹ.
They did not call him either.	Wọn ko pe e pẹlu.
He put the book in a bag.	O fi iwe naa sinu apo.
Maybe more time.	Boya akoko diẹ sii.
I decided to delete his name and establish it.	Mo pinnu lati pa orukọ rẹ kuro ki o si fi idi rẹ silẹ.
Maybe more now than ever.	Boya diẹ sii ni bayi ju lailai.
Money does not matter to me.	Owo ko ṣe pataki fun mi.
He wants us.	O fe wa.
I don't like it very much.	Nko feran re pupo.
They decided to reopen tomorrow.	Wọn pinnu lati tun ṣii ni ọla.
It seemed to last forever.	O dabi enipe lati mu lailai.
Afraid boys, they are all tied.	Awọn ọmọkunrin ti o bẹru, gbogbo wọn ti so.
By law they can only be found every three months.	Nipa ofin wọn le wa nikan ni gbogbo oṣu mẹta.
Understand that whatever we do, we do for the right reason.	Ni oye pe ohunkohun ti a ṣe, a ṣe fun idi ti o tọ.
I still have two things to do.	Mo tun ni awọn nkan meji lati ṣe.
The weather stopped.	Oju ojo duro.
She quickly looked around for a place to hide.	O yara wo ni ayika fun ibi kan lati tọju.
This works very well on another device.	Eyi ṣiṣẹ daradara daradara lori ẹrọ miiran.
Nothing else is allowed to be found.	Ko si ohun miiran ti a gba laaye lati wa.
None of this matters anymore.	Ko si eyi ti o ṣe pataki mọ.
He’s just doing his job.	O n ṣe iṣẹ rẹ nikan.
I would love to see her so happy.	Mo ni ife lati ri rẹ ki dun.
He was speaking in the heat of the moment.	O ti sọrọ ni ooru ti akoko.
I know your wife.	Mo mọ iyawo rẹ.
Not there.	Ko si nibẹ.
He ran towards the house.	O sare si ọna ile naa.
There are two things that can make them change their place.	Awọn nkan meji wa ti o le jẹ ki wọn yi aaye wọn pada.
The way it is.	Ni ọna ti o jẹ.
In my family, everyone wears a watch.	Ninu idile mi, gbogbo eniyan wọ aago kan.
He should not look at you.	Ko yẹ ki o ma wo ọ.
Okay, do it please.	O dara, ṣe ti o ba jọwọ.
Given that we tried.	Fun wipe a gbiyanju.
I need high.	Mo nilo giga.
I can't see them.	Nko le ri won.
We still don't.	A tun ko.
Maybe it could be more or less.	Boya o le jẹ diẹ sii tabi diẹ kere si.
I have to be the one to stay.	Mo ni lati jẹ ẹni lati duro.
She hated her story.	O korira itan rẹ.
Not a word.	Ko ọrọ kan.
It doesn’t matter either way.	Ko ṣe pataki ni ọna mejeeji.
You have had a very difficult time in it.	O ti ni akoko ti o nira pupọ ninu rẹ.
There are probably many of them.	O ṣee ṣe pupọ ninu wọn.
It may not work out.	O le ma ṣiṣẹ jade.
Well, who knows what might happen.	Daradara, tani o mọ ohun ti o le ṣẹlẹ.
They can do it themselves.	Wọn le ṣe funrararẹ.
Me and he.	Emi ati oun.
There were few people in the area at that time.	Awọn eniyan diẹ ni o wa ni agbegbe ni akoko yẹn.
His eyes never left my eyes.	Oju Re ko kuro ni oju mi.
If you find more errors please let me know.	Ti o ba ri awọn aṣiṣe diẹ sii jọwọ jẹ ki mi mọ.
This house did not exist until our time.	Ile yii ko wa titi di akoko wa.
Look at me!	Wo mi!
He said it was his.	O sọ pe tirẹ ni.
It usually takes two to three weeks to recover.	O maa n gba ọsẹ meji si mẹta lati gba pada.
If these people do the best they can, the doors open.	Ti awọn eniyan wọnyi ba ṣe ni ohun ti o dara julọ, awọn ilẹkun ṣii.
We decided it was best to let her enjoy the garden.	A pinnu pe o dara julọ lati jẹ ki o gbadun ọgba naa.
We have been sitting.	Ti a ti joko.
But it just is not possible to catch everyone.	Sugbon o kan ko ṣee ṣe lati mu gbogbo eniyan.
But not more than a month.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ju oṣu kan lọ.
This is really true.	Eyi jẹ otitọ ni otitọ.
I think it was a very good approach.	Mo ro pe o jẹ ọna ti o dara pupọ.
I do not use them.	Emi ko lo wọn.
I have been miserable.	Mo ti jẹ ibi.
Always eat before bed.	Nigbagbogbo o jẹun ṣaaju ki o to sun.
It requires only men.	O beere fun awọn ọkunrin nikan.
You’re way angry about that.	O ni ọna ti o binu nipa iyẹn.
It's good in my body.	O dara ninu ara mi.
You have to think about it.	O ni lati ni imọran nipa rẹ.
But the time has come.	Ṣugbọn akoko rẹ ti de.
Don't miss this world !.	Maṣe padanu aye yii!.
But at the same time, the test team is getting stronger.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko kanna, ẹgbẹ idanwo naa n ni okun sii.
It doesn't really matter what you think.	Ko ṣe pataki ero rẹ gaan.
Neither did it seriously in particular.	Bẹni ko ṣe daradara ni pataki.
For that matter it seems to me too.	Fun ọrọ yẹn o dabi iyẹn si mi paapaa.
Their children, go.	Awọn ọmọ wọn, lọ.
He looked inside.	O wo inu.
That doesn’t mean anything.	Iyẹn ko tumọ si nkankan.
He looks like a brother to me.	O dabi arakunrin fun mi.
There are two reasons for this.	Awọn idi meji lo wa lati ṣe bẹ.
But that is now gone.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ti lọ ni bayi.
You have to pull through.	O ni lati fa nipasẹ.
People have seen them.	Eniyan ti ri wọn.
I mean, frankly, it might even be better for me.	Mo tumọ si, ni otitọ, o le paapaa dara julọ fun mi.
He was born here.	A bi i nibi.
I love these kinds of games.	Mo nifẹ awọn iru ere wọnyi.
Special back on the phone.	Pataki pada lori foonu.
It is very open to suggestions.	O ṣii pupọ fun awọn imọran.
I would enjoy your company here.	Emi yoo gbadun ile-iṣẹ rẹ nibi.
Always make you feel like you are doing something wrong.	Nigbagbogbo jẹ ki o lero bi o ṣe nkan ti ko tọ.
Such is the case.	Iru bii bayi.
Can't buy.	Ko le ra.
I just thought all that.	Mo kan ro gbogbo iyẹn.
Maybe those people are there, they are looking at us now.	Boya awọn eniyan yẹn wa nibẹ, wọn n wo wa ni bayi.
Just go away.	Kan lọ kuro.
You have seen as it should.	O ti rii bi o ṣe yẹ.
Do you want to buy here?	Ṣe o fẹ lati ra nibi?
I will be a girl.	Emi yoo jẹ ọmọbirin.
She is doing well now.	O n ṣe daradara ni bayi.
He loves it all, because it is his.	O nifẹ gbogbo rẹ, nitori o jẹ tirẹ.
He was a friend.	O jẹ ọrẹ kan.
I know what that looks like.	Mo mọ bi iyẹn ṣe ri.
We need room to grow.	A nilo yara dagba.
I am one.	Emi ni ọkan.
In hot weather, people like to stay indoors.	Ni oju ojo gbona, eniyan fẹ lati duro ninu ile.
We know it's right.	A mọ pe o tọ.
And he is still here.	Ati pe o tun wa nibi.
You know, one of the great.	O mọ, ọkan ninu awọn nla.
Men must have someone to talk to.	Ọkunrin gbọdọ ni ẹnikan lati ba sọrọ.
We do not fully understand how this happened.	A ko ni oye ti o daju bi eyi ṣe ṣẹlẹ.
We have to do bad things.	A ni lati ṣe awọn ohun buburu.
Know yourself.	Mọ ara rẹ.
Or you may have purchased another game by mistake.	Tabi o le ti ra ere miiran nipasẹ aṣiṣe.
Solar energy cannot be exhausted.	Agbara oorun ko le pari.
If you do not believe me try.	Ti o ko ba gbagbọ mi gbiyanju.
There are few places to sit.	Awọn aaye diẹ wa lati joko.
It is a mistake.	O jẹ aṣiṣe.
And be active with the child.	Ki o si wa lọwọ pẹlu ọmọ.
He left soon after.	O lọ kuro ni kete lẹhin.
Everything is lost, back.	Ohun gbogbo ti o padanu, pada.
The words are intended to keep it.	Awọn ọrọ naa ni ipinnu lati pa a mọ.
It's very fast, very fast.	O yara pupọ, pupọ.
He is dead on it.	O ti ku lori rẹ.
What you need.	Ohun ti o nilo.
I put the books in my bag and looked up.	Mo di awọn iwe naa sinu apo mi ki o wo soke.
I miss you so much.	Mo padanu re pupo.
He was not happy to see me.	Inu re ko dun lati ri mi.
We are not sure how it will handle.	A ko ni idaniloju bawo ni yoo ṣe mu.
But look at the man.	Ṣugbọn wo ọkunrin naa.

He never came back.	Ko pada wa rara.
I went out with some of these boys.	Mo ti jade pẹlu diẹ ninu awọn ọmọkunrin wọnyi.
He turned his head to the side.	O yi ori rẹ si ẹgbẹ.
Of course, we let them do this.	Dajudaju, a jẹ ki wọn ṣe eyi.
It will be the best decision you have ever made.	Yoo jẹ ipinnu ti o dara julọ ti o ti ṣe.
I grew up as a mountain.	Mo ti dagba bi awọn oke.
Every train arrives on time.	Gbogbo ọkọ oju irin ti o de ni akoko.
It is very important to understand this.	O ṣe pataki pupọ lati ni oye eyi.
They will be here.	Wọn yoo wa nibi.
Raise your voice in music.	Gbe ohun rẹ soke ni orin.
That requires two things.	Iyẹn nilo ohun meji.
Return to your work schedule.	Pada si iṣẹ ṣiṣe rẹ.
I have to go to work tomorrow.	Mo ni lati lọ si ibi iṣẹ ni ọla.
And marriage is not easy.	Ati pe igbeyawo ko rọrun.
You can not have both methods.	O ko le ni awọn ọna mejeeji.

Neither do we recommend.	Bẹni a ko so.
I slept for a while.	Mo ti sun fun igba diẹ.
I started to look and it came.	Mo bẹrẹ si wo ati pe o wa.
This story is a box.	Itan yii jẹ apoti kan.
Early in the morning.	Ni kutukutu owurọ.
He is in an impossible situation.	O wa ni ipo ti ko ṣee ṣe.
Anything else means error.	Ohunkohun miiran tumọ si aṣiṣe.
Not only has he given so many gifts,	Kii ṣe pe o ti fun ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹbun,
They smashed something in his head.	Wọn fọ nkankan ni ori rẹ.
It's very simple.	O rọrun pupọ.
They have a small house.	Won ni ile kekere kan.
But that’s the best we can do right now.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn dara julọ ti a le ṣe ni bayi.
And he did.	Ati pe o ṣe.
Inside, your heart is working.	Ninu inu, ọkan rẹ n ṣiṣẹ.
When you remember, that is it.	Nigbati o ranti, iyẹn ni.
It is a matter of what works for you.	O jẹ ọrọ ti ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ fun ọ.
There are books that you can read without any problems.	Awọn iwe wa ti o le ka laisi eyikeyi iṣoro.
I don’t want people to have to go through the same thing.	Emi ko fẹ ki awọn eniyan ni lati lọ nipasẹ ohun kanna.
I took it out for him.	Mo mu u jade fun u.
They woke up early this morning.	Wọn ji ni kutukutu owurọ yii.
As the mother dies you.	Bi iya ti ku ti o.
It just happened that way.	O kan ṣẹlẹ ni ọna yẹn.
A child needs constant attention.	Ọmọde nilo akiyesi nigbagbogbo.
Let me know if you think it is fun !.	Jẹ ki mi mọ ti o ba ro pe o jẹ fun!.
Do not give it back.	Maṣe jẹ ki o fun ni pada.
was now the question.	wà bayi ibeere.
We stopped and bought some drinks.	A duro ati ra diẹ ninu awọn ohun mimu.
Some decide to feed their families first.	Diẹ ninu awọn pinnu lati bọ awọn idile wọn ni akọkọ.
I think you can.	Mo ro pe o le.
Do not be afraid.	Maṣe bẹru.
You can not believe it is true.	O ko le gbagbọ pe otitọ ni.
Get the right side.	Gba ẹgbẹ ti o tọ.
This does not seem to be the case.	Eyi ko dabi ẹni pe o ṣe pataki.
However, few people have jobs here.	Sibẹsibẹ, diẹ eniyan ni awọn iṣẹ nibi.
He told them all the details.	O sọ fun wọn ni gbogbo alaye.
You think this is the best thing that has happened to you.	O ro pe eyi ni ohun ti o dara julọ ti o ṣẹlẹ si ọ.
I have no problems with it.	Emi ko ni awọn iṣoro pẹlu rẹ.
They can be any kind of story you want.	Wọn le jẹ eyikeyi iru itan ti o fẹ.
That is not right.	Iyẹn ko tọ.
Of course he was watching.	Dajudaju o ti n wo.
Not a day goes by that he does not think about it.	Ko si ọjọ kan ti o kọja ti ko ronu nipa rẹ.
We will not be around for a few months.	A kii yoo wa ni ayika fun oṣu diẹ.
And you will make us a lot of money.	Ati pe iwọ yoo ṣe wa ni owo pupọ.
We will not feel stuck anymore.	A ko ni rilara di mọ.
We must know as much about them as possible.	A gbọdọ mọ bi Elo nipa wọn bi o ti ṣee.
I think it's full.	Mo ro pe o kun.
There is no such school.	Ko si iru ile-iwe.
There is a truth in this.	Otitọ kan wa ninu eyi.
Maybe it's too late now.	Boya o ti pẹ ṣaaju bayi.
Ask someone who helped you on another project.	Beere lọwọ ẹnikan ti o ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ lori iṣẹ miiran.
It is easy to write for.	O rọrun lati kọ fun.
Or maybe you are angry because it is true.	Tabi boya o binu nitori pe o jẹ otitọ.
I'm sure that's the kind of story you're talking about.	Mo ni idaniloju pe iru itan ti o n sọrọ nipa rẹ niyẹn.
And more work to be done.	Ati pe iṣẹ diẹ sii lati ṣe.
It is not a garden.	Kii ṣe ọgba.
Be worthy of yourself.	Ṣe o yẹ fun ara rẹ.
We can’t and we don’t need to do this.	A ko le ati pe a ko nilo lati ṣe eyi.
Good job everyone for keeping us up and doing great.	Ti o dara ise gbogbo eniyan fun a pa soke ati ki o ṣe nla.
At least, that's not true for me.	O kere ju, iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ fun mi.
In fact, it does not matter.	Ni otitọ, ko ṣe pataki paapaa.
He did nothing to harm anyone.	Ko ṣe ohunkohun lati ṣe ipalara fun ẹnikẹni.
You do not believe that you can look like you do now.	O ko gbagbọ pe o le wo bi o ti ṣe ni bayi.
I, for one, am happy.	Emi, fun ọkan, dun.
It is good for us to find agreement.	O dara fun wa lati wa adehun.
It made him laugh.	O ti mu u rẹrin.
It’s like a life work.	O dabi iṣẹ igbesi aye kan.
There is no way to know for sure.	Ko si ọna lati mọ daju.
The schools have a poor budget.	Awọn ile-iwe naa ni owo ti ko dara.
And everyone has an opinion on what they read.	Ati pe gbogbo eniyan ni ero lori ohun ti wọn ka.
How fast they are!	Bawo ni wọn ti yara to!
Stop on the road.	Duro ni opopona.
No previous problems.	Ko ni awọn iṣoro tẹlẹ.
The sister was very good at what she did.	Arabinrin naa dara gaan ni ohun ti o ṣe.
We just know how to get back on track.	A kan mọ bi a ṣe le tun pada.
Boy did they do it.	Ọmọkunrin ṣe wọn ni o ṣe.
It was, perhaps, the best hour ever.	O jẹ, boya, wakati ti o dara julọ.
I jumped to the foot of my bed.	Mo fo si ẹsẹ ti ibusun mi.
They arrived tired, but happy.	Wọn de ti rẹ, ṣugbọn dun.
I can't remember running past it before.	Emi ko le ranti ṣiṣe kọja rẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
And there will be a lot of people.	Ati ọpọlọpọ eniyan yoo wa.
But do not laugh.	Ṣugbọn maṣe rẹrin.
That came out in something else.	Wipe o jade ni ohun miiran.
His last.	Re kẹhin.
In the end, that is my job.	Ni ipari, iyẹn ni iṣẹ mi.
I will too.	Emi yoo tun.
So tell the whole story.	Nitorina sọ gbogbo itan naa.
Let me tell you how many games you have probably gone to.	Jẹ ki n sọ fun ọ iye awọn ere ti boya o ti lọ si.
Not in that car with his parents.	Kii ṣe ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yẹn pẹlu awọn obi rẹ.
That is a problem with many men like you.	Iyẹn ni iṣoro pẹlu ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkunrin bii iwọ.
Others will stay home and do their hair.	Awọn miiran yoo duro si ile wọn yoo ṣe irun wọn.
He said he was.	O sọ pe o jẹ.
For the moment they will find what they are.	Fun akoko wọn yoo wa ohun ti wọn wa.
People accept this.	Eniyan gba eyi.
Sometimes you have to go back.	Nigba miiran o ni lati pada sẹhin.
One way is to use two images.	Ọna kan ni lati lo awọn aworan meji.
He did, however, take pictures.	O ṣe, sibẹsibẹ, ya awọn aworan.
It is a new day.	Ojo tuntun ni.
You have not yet seen what your mouth looks like.	O ko tii ri ohun ti ẹnu rẹ dabi.
He seems to have no problem with this.	O dabi pe ko ni iṣoro pẹlu eyi.
I look down at my watch.	Mo wo isalẹ aago mi.
Okay, here it is.	O dara, nibi o wa.
First, we have to talk.	Ni akọkọ, a ni lati sọrọ.
That hasn't really changed.	Iyẹn ko ti yipada gaan.
I just know it means something to your wife.	Mo kan mọ pe o tumọ nkankan si iyawo rẹ.
He was young, never tried, and we never knew.	O jẹ ọdọ, ko gbiyanju, ati pe a ko mọ.
That is a question that should never be asked.	Iyẹn jẹ ibeere ti a ko gbọdọ beere rara.
You will see, it will be good.	Iwọ yoo rii, yoo dara.
I heard that.	Mo gbọ iyẹn.
Please help us.	Jọwọ ran wa lọwọ.
This is where we come in.	Eyi ni ibi ti a wa.
You will have to find for yourself.	Iwọ yoo ni lati wa fun ara rẹ.
But that is past and this is now.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ti kọja ati pe eyi jẹ bayi.
It helped me learn a lot about myself.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi lati kọ ẹkọ pupọ nipa ara mi.
Accept your contract.	Gba adehun rẹ.
Body, body, body.	Ara, ara ni, ara ni.
It gets better.	O ma n dara julọ.
Try to do and be everything for your team.	Gbiyanju lati ṣe ati jẹ ohun gbogbo fun ẹgbẹ rẹ.
We did not see them.	A ko ri wọn.
We picked up again.	A gbe soke lẹẹkansi.
I am not good.	Emi ko dara.
Someone needs to be at home with them most of the time.	Ẹnikan nilo lati wa ni ile pẹlu wọn ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
But the other three.	Ṣugbọn awọn mẹta miiran.
Money will not do.	Owo ko ni ṣe.
I do not see it.	Nko wo e.
And help them as we help everyone.	Ati ki o ran wọn bi a ran gbogbo eniyan.
Think about this for a minute.	Ronu nipa eyi fun iṣẹju kan.
You are in love and things.	O wa ninu ifẹ ati awọn nkan.
Some stick for another time.	Diẹ ninu awọn duro lori fun miiran igba.
I do.	Mo ṣe.
I did a lot of the work.	Mo ṣe pupọ julọ iṣẹ naa.
He is a very environmentally friendly person.	O jẹ eniyan ayika pupọ.
I do not even want to do.	Emi ko paapaa fẹ lati ṣe.
Look at such a thing before eating.	Wo iru nkan bẹẹ ṣaaju ki o to jẹun.
He looked away.	O wo kuro.
What is your opinion on the matter?	Kini ero rẹ lori ọrọ naa?
You lose every sense of time.	O padanu gbogbo ori ti akoko.
It makes it hot.	O mu ki o gbona.
In this it must appear to be very surprising.	Ni eyi o gbọdọ han lati jẹ iyalẹnu pupọ.
And who knows, maybe they will go.	Ati tani o mọ, boya wọn yoo lọ.
Zero is on what matters.	Odo ni lori ohun ti o jẹ pataki.
Take out the cat.	Gbe ologbo naa jade.
Many left the area.	Ọpọlọpọ kuro ni agbegbe naa.
The word is on it.	Ọrọ naa wa lori rẹ.
We made a great team.	A ṣe ẹgbẹ nla kan.
The ball was there and he put himself there.	Bọọlu naa wa nibẹ ati pe o gbe ara rẹ si.
They are quick to learn.	Wọn yara lati kọ ẹkọ.
Complete it all.	Ipari gbogbo rẹ.
Remove your shoes before entering the house.	Yọ bata rẹ kuro ṣaaju ki o to wọ ile.
Everyone knows everything.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ ohun gbogbo.
Get a hand on it.	Gba ọwọ kan lori rẹ.
What really happened.	Kini o ṣẹlẹ gaan.
Even so.	Paapaa Nitorina.
First, you say.	Ni akọkọ, o ti sọ.
But we do not want any trouble.	Sugbon a ko fẹ eyikeyi wahala.
I don’t know what’s going on around here anymore, he said.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ ni ayika ibi mọ, o sọ.
I began to realize.	Mo bẹrẹ lati mọ.
Most of his students are in high school.	Pupọ julọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe rẹ wa ni ile-iwe giga.
It can happen early in the morning or at night.	O le ṣẹlẹ ni kutukutu owurọ tabi ni alẹ.
He knew it was more than that.	O mọ pe o jẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
You have to delete this thing.	O ni lati pa nkan yii.
He has decided more than ever.	O ti pinnu diẹ sii ju lailai.
What did you do after school yesterday?	Kini o ṣe lẹhin ile-iwe lana?
You're right.	O to.
Today they are in.	Loni wọn wa ninu.
Because that's what he did.	Nitori ohun ti o ṣe niyẹn.
And his name, and where he went to school.	Ati orukọ rẹ, ati ibi ti o lọ si ile-iwe.
People are going to hate.	Eniyan ti wa ni lilọ lati korira.
He spent his entire working life with the company.	O lo gbogbo igbesi aye iṣẹ rẹ pẹlu ile-iṣẹ naa.
The boy was with his dog.	Ọmọkunrin naa wa pẹlu aja rẹ.
He is, possibly, living his own.	O jẹ, o ṣee ṣe, ngbe tirẹ.
Listen to understand.	Gbọ lati ni oye.
But he was not sure if he could do it.	Ṣugbọn ko da oun loju boya o le ṣe.
One that is not happy is that area.	Kan ti ko dun ni wipe agbegbe.
Months.	Awọn oṣu.
This is good with me.	Eyi dara pẹlu mi.
He does not want us.	Ko fe wa.
That seems to be the case now.	Iyẹn dabi pe o ti lọ ni bayi.
Let go of your worries.	Fi awọn aniyan rẹ silẹ.
I would like to visit you.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ṣabẹwo si ọdọ rẹ.
Cannot add history.	Ko le fi kun itan.
He said nothing.	Ko so nkankan.
I know where you can be.	Mo mọ ibi ti o le wa.
You should sit and warm yourself for a while.	O yẹ ki o joko ki o gbona ara rẹ fun igba diẹ.
Most people find it difficult to work with others.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni o nira lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu awọn miiran.
And to see everything go, like that.	Ati lati rii ohun gbogbo lọ, bii iyẹn.
He is dead, just like you.	O ti ku, bii rẹ.
Let us take to celebrating.	Jẹ ki a mu lati ṣe ayẹyẹ.
He wants to read about those.	O si fẹ ka nipa awon.
We made eye contact and he took it.	A ṣe oju oju ati pe o mu u.
Body image report.	Iroyin aworan ara.
There is a button.	Bọtini kan wa nibẹ.
I did not find my own way out of it.	Emi ko wa ọna ti ara mi kuro ninu rẹ.
I have to stand up for myself.	Mo ni lati dide fun ara mi.
I need these before dawn.	Mo nilo awọn wọnyi ṣaaju owurọ.

Very nice to meet you.	O dara pupọ lati pade rẹ.
Both know what it means well.	Awọn mejeeji mọ ohun ti o tumọ si daradara.
You can see them a lot.	O le rii wọn pupọ.
That is not what we have today.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti a ni loni.
High for your age.	Giga fun ọjọ ori rẹ.
After a week or so the day arrives.	Lẹhin ọsẹ kan tabi bẹ ọjọ naa de.
They took care of my little one.	Wọn tọju kekere mi.
I just have no idea where I went from here.	Mo kan ko ni imọran ibiti mo ti lọ lati ibi.
Essentially, take a few minutes and do this physically.	Ni pataki, gba iṣẹju diẹ ki o ṣe eyi ni ti ara.
No one was around to talk to me.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa ni ayika lati ba mi sọrọ.
I just want to come back and help.	Mo kan fẹ lati pada wa ṣe iranlọwọ.
Now he has lost everything he had taken.	Bayi o ti padanu ohun gbogbo ti o ti ya a.
I did well in class.	Mo ti ṣe dara ni kilasi.
The work was completed on time.	Iṣẹ naa ti pari ni akoko.
For those who hate it, wash them.	Fun awọn ti o korira rẹ, fo wọn.
I do nothing.	Nko se nkankan.
None of them for the others.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn fun awọn miiran.
It doesn't seem right.	Ko dabi pe o tọ.
Do not go without them.	Maṣe lọ laisi wọn.
A quick in and out.	A awọn ọna ni ati ki o jade.
You just don’t want to do more.	O kan ko fẹ lati ṣe diẹ sii.
Another two or three minutes would have been done.	Iṣẹju meji tabi mẹta miiran yoo ti ṣe.
Whether it made me interested or not.	Boya o ṣe mi ni anfani tabi rara.
Let’s do it this way.	Jẹ ki a ṣe ni ọna yii.
We should have been helped there.	O yẹ ki a ti ran wa nibẹ.
He will have others see the matter soon.	Oun yoo ni ki awọn miiran wo ọrọ naa laipẹ.
Back in myself, this room.	Pada sinu ara mi, yara yi.
A hot summer's day.	A gbona ooru ká ọjọ.
I love my parents.	Mo nifẹ awọn obi mi.
This is probably your minimum energy time.	Eyi ṣee ṣe akoko agbara rẹ ti o kere julọ.
For a minute, one of them did not speak.	Fun iṣẹju kan, ọkan ninu wọn ko sọrọ.
His word is law.	Ọrọ rẹ jẹ ofin.
Almost anyone can understand that.	Bii ẹnikẹni le loye iyẹn.
They just eat each other.	Wọn kan jẹ ara wọn.
Decisions are made, and cannot be changed.	Awọn ipinnu ni a ṣe, ati pe ko le yipada.
You’re giving someone attention, and you don’t ask for anything.	O n fun ẹnikan ni akiyesi, ati pe iwọ ko beere ohunkohun.

It comes from within.	O wa lati inu.
We will see others as ourselves.	A yoo ri awọn miiran bi ara wa.
It made me laugh !.	O mu mi rẹrin!.
The situation is very good now.	Ipo naa dara pupọ ni bayi.
Not because one area is more important than the other.	Kii ṣe nitori pe agbegbe kan ṣe pataki ju awọn miiran lọ.
This will prevent you from leaving.	Eyi yoo di ọ lọwọ lati lọ kuro.
Let's go out for lunch.	Jẹ ki a jade lọ fun ounjẹ ọsan.
I need you to know this.	Mo nilo ki o mọ eyi.
Have a long drive home.	Ni a gun wakọ ile.
No time will be lost.	Ko si akoko kan yoo padanu.
You can throw your mother out in time.	O le ju iya rẹ jade ni akoko.
Maybe not.	Boya o ko.
I do not want my wife to go out to work.	Emi ko fẹ ki iyawo mi jade lọ si ibi iṣẹ.
You will not believe.	Iwọ kii yoo gbagbọ.
I was too scared to go out.	Mo bẹru pupọ lati jade.
I would like to bring this water to a boil.	Emi yoo fẹ lati mu omi yii wa si oke.
He could not go back.	Ko le pada sẹhin.
This new book contains some amazing pictures.	Iwe tuntun yii ni awọn aworan iyalẹnu ninu.

He will draw through this.	Oun yoo fa nipasẹ eyi.

You can say he does not believe.	O le sọ pe ko gbagbọ.

The situation is not very good.	Ipo ko dara pupọ.
You know people need it there.	O mọ pe awọn eniyan nilo rẹ nibẹ.
Or, at least you didn't, he didn't ask.	Tabi, o kere ju o ni, ko beere lọwọ rẹ rara.
This is used as the main building material.	Eyi ni a lo bi ohun elo ile akọkọ.
And he grew up the way most boys do.	Ati pe o dagba ni ọna ti ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọkunrin ṣe.
That is what we eat.	Ohun ti a jẹ niyẹn.
Do you think you can help me with this.	Ṣe o ro pe o le ran mi lọwọ pẹlu eyi.
The question is how.	Ibeere naa ni bawo ni.

The sister improved on me after that.	Arabinrin naa dara si mi lẹhin iyẹn.
I have to start again, teach the kids.	Mo ni lati bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi, kọ awọn ọmọde.
This, of course, has not happened before.	Eyi, ko tii ṣe tẹlẹ.

They can't think of it.	Wọn ko le ro ero rẹ.
He called and told me.	O pe o sọ fun mi.
I have no idea whether that is a good thing or not.	Emi ko ni imọran boya iyẹn jẹ ohun ti o dara tabi rara.
But you did not.	Ṣugbọn iwọ ko ṣe bẹ.
We feel better when we are together.	A dara julọ nigbati a ba wa papọ.
Impossible, he was told.	Ko ṣee ṣe, o ti sọ fun.
I invite all my friends here.	Mo pe gbogbo awọn ọrẹ mi nibi.
The girl was happy to meet a friend.	Inu ọmọbirin naa dun lati pade ọrẹ kan.
I will be in classes with him.	Emi yoo wa ni awọn kilasi pẹlu rẹ.
Hot water.	Omi gbona.
And yourself, of course.	Ati funrararẹ, dajudaju.
Not worthy of him.	Ko yẹ fun u.
There is nothing like this at home.	Ko si nkankan bi eleyi ni ile.
This is the place.	Ibi yi ni.
There is game and water.	Ere ati omi wa.
It is outside.	O wa ni ita.
The sister is not the same person as last week.	Arabinrin naa kii ṣe eniyan kanna bi ọsẹ to kọja.
I think you are in love.	Mo ro pe o wa ni ife.
Stay tuned.	Duro ni ohunkohun.
It will not change by itself.	Kii yoo yipada funrararẹ.
It's been a while.	O ti pẹ diẹ.
He never came home.	Ko wa si ile rara.
I want to sit.	Mo fe joko.
They cannot understand what they want to do wrong.	Wọn ko le loye ohun ti wọn fẹ ṣe aṣiṣe.
He also built his city.	O si tun ti a kọ rẹ ilu.
It is possible.	O ṣee ṣe.
It has rules.	O ni awọn ofin.
Do not try to think or not think.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati ronu tabi ko ronu.
No way.	Ko ṣee ṣe.
He placed his hand on my back.	O gbe ọwọ rẹ le ẹhin mi.
Everyone went home.	Gbogbo eniyan lo si ile.
The sister was always a cat.	Arabinrin naa nigbagbogbo jẹ ologbo.
You apply this on the face and eye area.	O lo eyi lori oju ati agbegbe oju.
I just want it to happen.	Mo kan fẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
It’s okay to wait for the school bus.	O tọ lati duro fun ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ile-iwe naa.
This is where the opportunities come.	Eyi ni ibi ti awọn anfani wa.
I stand for something.	Mo duro fun nkankan.
She quickly got up from her seat to look her best.	O yara dide lati ijoko rẹ lati rii dara julọ.
I will have a lot to ask you about other things.	Emi yoo ni pupọ lati beere lọwọ rẹ ni awọn nkan miiran.
Apparently he did a little more.	O han pe o ṣe diẹ diẹ miiran.
We moved from place to place.	A gbe lati ibi kan si miiran lori.
Region.	Agbegbe.
Know young people, age should rise.	Mọ awọn ọdọ, iye ọjọ ori yẹ ki o dide.
That question will not be missed.	Wipe ibeere naa kii yoo padanu.
Other tests continue.	Awọn idanwo miiran tẹsiwaju.
That’s where it starts and ends.	Iyẹn ni ibi ti o bẹrẹ ati pari.
He is a child.	Ọmọde ni.
Who wrote this?	Tani o kọ eyi?
For what, he does not know.	Fun kini, ko mọ.
Sure we are the children of the sun.	O daju pe a jẹ ọmọ ti oorun.
It has never been better.	Ko ti dara rara.
That he tried again.	Wipe o tun gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
There is not much here worth selling.	Nibẹ ni ko Elo nibi tọ ta.
So can we meet at your site? 	Nitorina ṣe a le pade ni aaye rẹ?
I'm glad to see.	Inu mi dun lati ri.

Do not give them out.	Ma fun wọn jade.

I usually get there at 3pm.	Mo maa n wa nibẹ ni aago mẹta ọsan.
No, it does not rain.	Rara, o ko ni ojo.
I know the area.	Mo mọ agbegbe naa.
Get them talking.	Gba wọn sọrọ.
To this day, one is not.	Ni ọjọ yii, ọkan kii ṣe.
I will give him a job you can do at this time.	Emi yoo fun u ni iṣẹ ti o le ṣe ni akoko yii.
People want their work to be important.	Awọn eniyan fẹ ki iṣẹ wọn ṣe pataki.
It takes some time.	O gba akoko diẹ.
Or get him out of it.	Tabi gba u jade ti o.
They were born here.	Won bi nibi.
Your work is long enough.	Iṣẹ rẹ ti pẹ to.
Children need to hear stories to help them sleep.	Awọn ọmọde nilo lati gbọ awọn itan lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun wọn lati sun.
To this day, nothing has changed.	Titi di oni, ko si ohun ti o yipada.
You are wrong.	O ṣe aṣiṣe.
It is seen below.	O ti ri ni isalẹ.
I use when not.	Mo n lo nigba ti o ko si.
He will change things.	Oun yoo yi nkan pada.
And it has to break.	Ati pe o ni lati fọ.
If you do not pay me.	Ti ko ba san mi.
They are.	Wọn ti wa.
I don't want to stop it.	Emi ko fẹ lati da a duro.
And we are sorry.	Ati pe a binu.
That happened because of the people inside him.	Iyẹn ṣẹlẹ nitori awọn eniyan inu rẹ.
I do not know why.	Nko mo idi re.
These seem to interest me.	Awọn wọnyi dabi ohun ti o nifẹ si mi.
She told him to go.	O sọ fun u pe ki o lọ.
In space, everywhere is up.	Ni aaye, ibi gbogbo wa ni oke.
Your life needs it.	Igbesi aye rẹ nilo rẹ.
We need to know what happened.	A nilo lati mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
He doesn't like that.	Oun ko fẹran iyẹn.
Much could have happened at that time.	Elo le ti ṣẹlẹ ni akoko yẹn.
Maybe one enjoys this.	Boya eniyan gbadun eyi.
However, that is not enough.	Sibẹsibẹ iyẹn ko to.
When we need your help, we will contact him.	Nigba ti a ba nilo iranlọwọ rẹ, a yoo kan si i.
Sometimes, things get very physical.	Nigba miiran, awọn nkan gba ti ara pupọ.
Work should be work and home should be home.	Iṣẹ yẹ ki o jẹ iṣẹ ati ile yẹ ki o jẹ ile.
There is an important advantage in terms of space.	Anfani pataki kan wa ni awọn ofin ti aaye.
I'm going now.	Mo n lọ ni bayi.
There is nothing worth worrying about.	Ko si ohun ti o tọ lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
I do not think anyone can love me.	Nko ro pe enikeni le feran mi.
The river was in sight.	Odo wà ni oju.
You think too but will have to do.	O ro ju ṣugbọn yoo ni lati ṣe.
None of them were forced.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti a fi agbara mu.
Some people are just not cut out for it.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ti wa ni o kan ko ge jade fun o.
We will have celebrations, of course.	A yoo ni awọn ayẹyẹ, dajudaju.
We do not.	A ko ṣe.
But the book is more than that.	Ṣugbọn iwe naa ju iyẹn lọ.
I love you more than you are my own child.	Mo nifẹ rẹ ju ti o ba jẹ ọmọ ti ara mi.
It’s a good idea if it works.	O jẹ imọran ti o dara ti o ba ṣiṣẹ.
For many days, boats could not do so.	Fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọjọ, awọn ọkọ oju omi ko le ṣe bẹ.
They are just looking for time.	Wọn n wa akoko nikan.
That’s the people you want.	Iyẹn ni awọn eniyan ti o fẹ.
The sister is very beautiful.	Arabinrin naa lẹwa pupọ.
Just go home now.	Kan lọ si ile ni bayi.
They are late for the meeting.	Wọn ti pẹ fun ipade naa.
That is for us to help him with.	Iyẹn jẹ fun wa lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u pẹlu.
But someone has to do it.	Ṣugbọn ẹnikan ni lati ṣe.
I shouldn’t have let him drink anything last night.	Emi ko yẹ ki o jẹ ki o mu ohunkohun ni alẹ ana.
, enter buildings and open fire.	, wọ awọn ile ati ṣii ina.
We need to hear what people are saying.	A nilo lati gbọ ohun ti eniyan n sọ.
He picked them up.	O gbe wọn.
Just a moment please.	Jọwọ fun akoko kan.
I know what many of you think.	Mo mọ ohun ti ọpọlọpọ awọn ti o ro.
They did not talk to me.	Wọn ko ba mi sọrọ.
It is possible.	O ṣee ṣe.
At the end of the day, you want to.	Ni ipari ọjọ, o fẹ.
That is to say, there will be.	Iyẹn ni lati sọ, yoo tun wa.
He plans to do another at one point.	O gbero lati ṣe miiran ni aaye kan.
Place these boxes in place.	Gbe awọn apoti wọnyi si ibi.
Everyone loves to laugh.	Gbogbo eniyan nifẹ lati rẹrin.
I just want to go back to school.	Mo kan fẹ lati pada si ile-iwe.
Everyone wants money.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ owo.
None of these things work.	Ko si ọkan ninu nkan wọnyi ti o ṣiṣẹ.
Most of the time, it is read by the sea.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba, o ti ka nipasẹ okun.
He had trouble with the books.	O ni wahala pẹlu awọn iwe.
Now, it is open.	Bayi, o ṣii.
Much has changed in the short term.	Pupọ ti yipada ni akoko diẹ.
Back to our room.	Pada si yara wa.
I do not need to.	Emi ko nilo lati.
Maybe it was such a test.	Boya o jẹ iru idanwo kan.
They will not have trouble getting.	Wọn kii yoo ni wahala lati gba.
He would like even more with a drink.	Oun yoo fẹ paapaa diẹ sii pẹlu ohun mimu.
It was a test.	O jẹ idanwo kan.
I do not want to be arrested, but it is wrong.	Emi ko fẹ ki a mu mi, ṣugbọn o jẹ aṣiṣe.
Maybe he's killing her.	Boya o n pa a.
It is not your thing.	Kii ṣe nkan rẹ.
I told you he was behind me.	Mo sọ fun ọ pe o wa lẹhin mi.
If there is how it is possible.	Ti o ba wa nibẹ bawo ni o ṣe ṣee ṣe.
Just as well, he thought.	O kan bi daradara, o ro.
Sounds pretty similar.	Dun lẹwa iru.
My new husband eats.	Ọkọ mi tuntun jẹ ounjẹ.
Image.	Aworan.
It will take about an hour to reach the city.	Yoo gba to bii wakati kan lati de ilu naa.
Here is what we will do.	Eyi ni ohun ti a yoo ṣe.
You will never talk about what happened here to anyone, ever.	Iwọ kii yoo sọrọ nipa ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nibi si ẹnikẹni, lailai.
Get up early and get a good night's sleep.	Dide ni kutukutu ki o si sun oorun ti o dara.
She is a great girl.	O jẹ ọmọbirin nla.
Please do it all here.	Jọwọ ṣe gbogbo yin ni ibi.
It looks great.	O wo pupọ julọ.
I also really mean.	Mo tun tumọ si gaan.
It looks like they have yours.	O dabi pe wọn ni tirẹ.
What matters is one point.	Ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni aaye kan.
Out of town.	Jade ti ilu.
Prices are volatile.	Awọn owo ni awọn yipada.
Eat whatever is placed in front of you.	Je ohunkohun ti a gbe si iwaju rẹ.
So please, do what you can.	Nitorina jọwọ, ṣe ohun ti o le.
More women learn here.	Awọn obinrin diẹ sii kọ ẹkọ nibi.
I want children and marriage, some days.	Mo fẹ ọmọ ati igbeyawo, diẹ ninu awọn ọjọ.
We need to put our books into it.	A nilo lati fi awọn iwe wa sinu.
He just decided he hated her behind his side.	O kan pinnu pe o korira rẹ lẹhin ẹgbẹ rẹ.
That would be for him.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ fun u.
No one said anything for a while.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ohunkohun fun igba diẹ.
But we cannot stand like this forever.	Ṣugbọn a ko le duro bi eyi lailai.
I would be fine.	Emi yoo dara.
It seems like you have that much more.	O dabi pe o ni iyẹn ju pupọ julọ lọ.
The woman's condition was not noticeable.	Ipo ti obinrin naa ko ṣe akiyesi.
You have more.	O ni diẹ.
They made no mistake at all.	Wọn ko ṣe aṣiṣe rara.
I just want to leave.	Mo kan fẹ lati lọ kuro.
Something left out.	Nkankan ti a fi silẹ.
He let his feet move.	O jẹ ki awọn ẹsẹ rẹ gbe.
You are gone.	O ti lọ.
I forgot my key.	Mo gbagbe bọtini mi.
First drink water.	Ni akọkọ mu omi.
But we want to get money.	Ṣugbọn a fẹ lati gba owo.
Which would be the same here so.	Eyi ti yoo jẹ kanna nibi bẹ.
However, we do not see whether one of these recommendations is promising.	Sibẹsibẹ, a ko rii boya ọkan ninu awọn imọran wọnyi ni ileri.
And it started to come out.	Ati pe o bẹrẹ si jade.
They can't talk.	Wọn ko le sọrọ.
We will do that day.	A yoo ṣe ni ọjọ yẹn.
I would love to hear from you about it !.	Emi yoo fẹ lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ nipa rẹ!.
Every one needs.	Gbogbo ọkan nilo.
I don't like it there.	Emi ko fẹran rẹ nibẹ.
It is full of beautiful pictures.	O kun fun awọn aworan lẹwa.
But that’s not the whole story.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe gbogbo itan naa.
I was three times before he let me go to work.	Mo wa ni igba mẹta ṣaaju ki o to jẹ ki n lọ si ibi iṣẹ.
Make sure they know your personal information if you change it.	Rii daju pe wọn mọ alaye ti ara ẹni ti o ba yipada.
Would you like some tea?	Ṣe iwọ yoo tọju tii diẹ bi?
I do not want to see.	Emi ko fẹ lati ri.
Get out of the house.	Jade kuro ninu ile.
That's what it says.	Ohun ti o sọ niyẹn.
You are on your own for information.	Ti o ba wa lori ara rẹ fun alaye.
Still very beautiful that made your heart happy.	Ṣi lẹwa pupọ ti o mu ọkan rẹ dun.
They think he is destined for great things.	Wọn ro pe o ti pinnu fun awọn ohun nla.
People will hate such a beautiful day.	Eniyan yoo korira iru kan lẹwa ọjọ.
Tell them what they want to hear.	Sọ fun wọn ohun ti wọn fẹ gbọ.
He stopped and went out.	O duro o si jade.
You think you know what it means.	O ro pe o mọ ohun ti o tumọ si.
This is especially true in the food industry.	Eyi jẹ otitọ paapaa ni ile-iṣẹ ounjẹ.
Your body is not good.	Ara ara re ko dara.
That worked for about a minute.	Iyẹn ṣiṣẹ fun bii iṣẹju kan.
I would love to be here and see this thing through.	Mo nifẹ lati wa nibi ati rii nkan yii nipasẹ.
You have so many other things to worry about.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun miiran lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
Maybe the whole office.	Boya gbogbo ọfiisi.
His work here ended for the time being.	Iṣẹ rẹ nibi ti pari fun akoko naa.
It would be better to forget everything.	Yoo dara julọ lati gbagbe ohun gbogbo.
I can think of a few ways you could have done it.	Mo le ronu awọn ọna diẹ ti o le ti ṣe.
Now I want to play this new game.	Bayi mo fẹ lati ṣe ere tuntun yii.
I mean really good.	Mo tumọ si dara gaan.
This book is not new.	Iwe yii kii ṣe tuntun.
Well, anyone can be wrong.	O dara, ẹnikẹni le ṣe aṣiṣe.
Maybe it will get you to plan better.	Boya o yoo gba ọ lati gbero dara julọ.
This will be your room.	Eyi yoo jẹ yara rẹ.
But enough for now.	Sugbon to ti ti fun bayi.
He is alive.	O wa laaye.
They are walking in the rain back to their cars.	Wọn n rin ni ojo pada si awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wọn.
I saw what you can do last night.	Mo ti ri ohun ti o le ṣe ni alẹ ana.
Turn them up, ask for their books.	Yi wọn soke, beere awọn iwe wọn.
These roads were full last week.	Awọn ọna wọnyi ti kun ni ọsẹ to kọja.
And you can not do anything.	Ati pe o ko le ṣe ohunkohun.
Just like them on more.	O kan bi wọn loju diẹ sii.
But it will be costly.	Ṣugbọn yoo jẹ iye owo.
To be around her would be absolutely amazing.	Lati wa ni ayika rẹ yoo jẹ iyalẹnu gaan.
This is the right time for you to move on.	Eyi ni akoko ti o tọ fun ọ lati gbe.
This may be the best meal today.	Eyi le jẹ ounjẹ to dara julọ loni.
We need to know.	A nilo lati mọ.
Of course we are still there.	Dajudaju a tun wa.
I raise my head.	Mo gbe ori mi soke.
You pull yourself up to have the best look.	O fa ara rẹ soke lati ni oju ti o dara julọ.
Do not move.	Maṣe gbe lọ.
Once you have it, they will ask for money.	Ni kete ti o ba ni, wọn yoo beere owo.
He did not talk to that person.	Ko si sọrọ si eniyan yẹn.
And he wanted me.	O si fe mi.
They can become anything.	Wọn le di ohunkohun.
Two policemen were there.	Awọn ọlọpa meji wa nibẹ.
It’s a small home business, but a very important one.	O jẹ ile-iṣẹ ile kekere, ṣugbọn ọkan pataki pupọ.
For people who have such a problem.	Fun awọn eniyan ti o ni iru iṣoro bẹẹ.
Or a car.	Tabi ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
They have taken everything from me.	Wọn ti gba ohun gbogbo lọwọ mi.
That is the first thing.	Nkan akoko niyen.
Leave that thing, he said.	Fi nkan yẹn silẹ, o sọ.
However, let me ask you a question.	Sibẹsibẹ, jẹ ki n beere ibeere kan fun ọ.
One we found in the store, but you know.	Ọkan ti a ri ni ile itaja, ṣugbọn o mọ.
The sister is beautiful too.	Arabinrin naa lẹwa paapaa.
It doesn't taste good to me.	Ko dun si mi.
The most important question at the moment.	Ibeere pataki julọ ni akoko.
It seemed like a good idea, so we did.	O dabi enipe imọran to dara, nitorina a ṣe.
The problems move and they surround yourself.	Awọn iṣoro naa gbe ati pe wọn ni ayika ara rẹ.
They work with them.	Wọn ṣiṣẹ pẹlu wọn.
Not any of them.	Ko eyikeyi ninu wọn.
See or see.	Wo tabi ri.
They are amazing.	Wọn jẹ iyanu.
Don’t force things.	Maṣe fi agbara mu awọn nkan.
This is a work machine with nothing on it.	Eyi jẹ ẹrọ iṣẹ ti ko si nkankan lori rẹ.
You will not find the family you are looking for.	Iwọ kii yoo ri idile ti o n wa.
Of course sometimes it’s not that he doesn’t know.	Dajudaju nigba miiran kii ṣe pe ko mọ.
Some walk away.	Diẹ ninu awọn rin kuro.
It's too late, too late.	O ti pẹ ju, o pẹ pupọ.
Thus, a girl has a loving family because of it.	Bayi, ọmọbirin kan ni idile ifẹ nitori rẹ.
However, that is not good.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn ko dara.
Not sure what they are using now.	Ko daju ohun ti wọn lo ni bayi.
But it is not so.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ.
Turns out, he likes kids a lot more than he lets you go.	Yipada, o fẹran awọn ọmọde pupọ diẹ sii ju ti o jẹ ki o lọ.
A long time back.	Igba pipẹ pada.
It was a small space, no room to store anything.	O jẹ aaye kekere kan, ko si yara lati tọju ohunkohun.
It's just happening.	O kan n ṣẹlẹ.
You know what you’re testing on.	O mọ ohun ti o ni idanwo lori.
This will not change.	Eyi kii yoo yipada.
No one knows us.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ wa.
All of these things work in a very good way.	Gbogbo nkan wọnyi ṣiṣẹ ni ọna ti o dara pupọ.
They talked it down.	Wọn sọrọ rẹ silẹ.
Maybe three times.	Boya ni igba mẹta.
It looks like it's still standing.	O dabi pe o tun duro.
Wait for a while.	Duro fun igba diẹ.
And just like that, the idea came to him.	Ati pe bii iyẹn, ero naa wa si ọdọ rẹ.
I doubt whether it is possible.	Mo ṣiyemeji boya o ṣee ṣe.
One day, it could be you.	Ni ọjọ kan, o le jẹ iwọ.
Who seemed to be happy a few days earlier.	Ẹniti o dabi ẹni pe o dun ni ọjọ meji diẹ ṣaaju.
Okay, they went to work on me, and it was.	O dara, wọn lọ ṣiṣẹ lori mi, ati pe o jẹ.
You are, you love me more than anyone else.	Iwọ ni, o fẹ mi ju ẹnikẹni miiran lọ.
I think he decided to do it the night before the wedding.	Mo ro pe o pinnu lati ṣe ni alẹ ṣaaju ki igbeyawo naa.
Life is gone.	Igbesi aye ti lọ.
You see, you know you want to make a decision.	O wo, o mọ pe o fẹ ṣe ipinnu.
I think it was time for me to go to bed.	Mo ro pe o to akoko fun mi lati lọ si ibusun.
After that, you can change your life.	Lẹhin iyẹn, o le yipada ni igbesi aye rẹ.
You can change ideas.	O le yi awọn ero pada.
But it always hurts as bad.	Sugbon o nigbagbogbo ipalara bi buburu.
See what you do.	Wo ohun ti o ṣe.
It was not going to be won.	Ti o ti ko lilọ si wa ni gba.
You eat three meals a day.	O jẹ ounjẹ mẹta ni ọjọ kan.
He could not get out of that.	Ko le kuro ninu iyẹn.
And they are a great value, those boys.	Ati pe wọn jẹ iye nla, awọn ọmọkunrin yẹn.
The house has no doors.	Ile naa ko ni ilẹkun.
Get to know your family again.	Gba lati mọ ebi re lẹẹkansi.
You may be able to find me something.	O le ni anfani lati wa mi nkankan.
And there people are killed.	Ati nibẹ awọn eniyan ti wa ni pa.
Her thoughts turned to the woman's body.	Awọn ero rẹ yipada si ara obinrin naa.
There are no office people here.	Ko si awọn eniyan ọfiisi nibi.
Much has changed in his life, in his heart.	Pupọ ti yipada ninu igbesi aye rẹ, ninu ọkan rẹ.
O ta a.	O ta a.
Think of it this way.	Ronu nipa rẹ bii eyi.
Read for yourself !.	Ka fun ara rẹ!.
You have to spend that time.	O ni lati lo akoko naa.
Opportunity will show itself.	Anfani yoo fi ara rẹ han.
There are things of interest to us from that.	Awọn nkan ti o nifẹ si wa lati iyẹn.
They will not be there to help us.	Wọn kii yoo wa nibẹ lati ran wa lọwọ.
A little decision this morning.	Ipinnu kekere kan ni owurọ yii.
But it will definitely give you a lot of benefits in the future.	Ṣugbọn dajudaju yoo fun ọ ni anfani pupọ ni ọjọ iwaju.
Remember your victory.	Ranti rẹ gun.
And look at their faces.	Ati ki o wo oju wọn.
I do nothing.	Nko se nkankan.
We never thought about marriage at that time.	A ko ronu nipa igbeyawo rara ni akoko yẹn.
She wants to get married.	O fẹ lati ṣe igbeyawo.
He considered himself a simple man.	O ka ara rẹ ni ọkunrin ti o rọrun.
And maybe even more.	Ati boya paapaa diẹ sii.
This makes our problem even more difficult.	Eyi jẹ ki iṣoro wa nira pupọ sii.
I think that's really good.	Mo ro pe iyẹn dara gaan.
Tell none of your jobs.	So fun ko si ọkan ninu rẹ ise.
The trip returned after three weeks.	Irin-ajo naa pada lẹhin ọsẹ mẹta.
Who is on your side.	Tani o wa lori ẹgbẹ rẹ.
Growing cities is a big problem.	Awọn ilu ti o dagba jẹ iṣoro nla.
What happened to us doesn’t even mean anything.	Ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ pẹlu wa ko paapaa tumọ si nkankan.
I have never seen this car before.	Emi ko tii ri ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yii tẹlẹ.
Before he left me.	Ṣaaju ki o to fi mi silẹ.
I thought of this difficult question.	Mo ro ibeere ti o nira yii.
Maybe it's too late.	Boya o ti pẹ.
They do not need to say what they will do.	Wọn ko nilo lati sọ ohun ti wọn yoo ṣe.
It is written everywhere.	Nibi gbogbo ni wọn kọ ọ.
That alone is enough to make you stop.	Iyẹn nikan ni o to lati jẹ ki o da duro.
Members are also.	Awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ tun jẹ.
My sister said she could quit her job.	Arabinrin mi sọ pe o le fi iṣẹ rẹ silẹ.
This agreement changed the whole community.	Adehun yii yi gbogbo agbegbe pada.
I enjoyed the game.	Mo gbadun ere naa.
You can also send a message if you just need someone to talk to.	O tun le fi ọrọ ranṣẹ ti o ba kan nilo ẹnikan lati ba sọrọ.
I will tell you one day.	Emi yoo sọ fun ọ ni ọjọ kan.
Most people in the area have a negative attitude.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni agbegbe naa ni oju ti ko dara.
To see yourself for who you really are.	Lati rii ararẹ fun ẹni ti o jẹ gaan.
There is not enough light to run the machines.	Ko si ina to lati ṣiṣẹ awọn ẹrọ naa.
Sorry about that.	Ma binu nipa ohun gbogbo.
Or at least that’s how it looks.	Tabi o kere ju iyẹn ni bi o ṣe dabi.
Obviously they will never again.	O han gbangba pe wọn kii yoo ṣe mọ.
Take a walk around and a look.	Ya kan rin ni ayika ati ki o kan wo.
He said the money had been stolen.	O so wipe owo ti ji.
This is their first meeting.	Eyi ni ipade akọkọ wọn.
Men are in it.	Awọn ọkunrin wa ni o.
The idea is that we get what we want.	Ero naa ni pe a gba ohun ti a fẹ.
Who I think left a while ago.	Tani Mo ro pe o fi silẹ ni igba diẹ sẹhin.
He’s sleeping, he has to come.	O n sun, o ni lati wa.
Have to have.	Ni lati ni.
It is high and beautiful.	O ga ati lẹwa.
They have everyone.	Won ni gbogbo eniyan.
They never talked about that.	Wọn ko sọrọ nipa iyẹn rara.
I would listen to her music in the book every morning.	Emi yoo gbọ orin rẹ ninu iwe ni gbogbo owurọ.
Neither, however, anything of the kind.	Bẹni ko si, sibẹsibẹ, ohunkohun ti iru.
How that feels.	Bawo ni iyẹn ṣe rilara rẹ.
I must, especially.	Emi gbọdọ, paapaa.
Remove the foot.	Mu ẹsẹ kuro.
But something killed them.	Sugbon nkankan pa wọn.
Your life stands still.	Igbesi aye rẹ duro jẹ.
Which is my problem.	Eyi ti o ni wahala mi.
Iron ore.	Irin irin.
Some other ways.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọna miiran.
I accept that, and it makes sense.	Mo gba iyẹn, ati pe o jẹ oye.
The fire station stands on a hill overlooking the beach.	Ile ina duro lori oke kan ti o n wo eti okun.
A little more than a year ago.	Diẹ diẹ sii ju ọdun kan sẹhin.
You will be my future.	Iwọ yoo jẹ ọjọ iwaju mi.
It will happen to you, too.	Yoo ṣẹlẹ bẹ fun ọ, paapaa.
He walked across the room and knocked on the door.	O rin kọja yara naa o si kan ilẹkun.
My own thoughts.	Ti ara mi ero.
Everyone is on really, really well.	Gbogbo eniyan ni lori gaan, gan daradara.
Let's go home.	Jẹ ki a lọ si ile.
Well the amount of money.	Daradara iye ti awọn owo.
I reached out to her mother the other day.	Mo de ọdọ iya rẹ ni ọjọ miiran.
If you enjoyed the first book, only good.	Ti o ba gbadun iwe akọkọ, o dara nikan.
Can someone help me?	Njẹ ẹnikan le ran mi lọwọ.
But something else is at work here as well.	Ṣugbọn nkan miiran wa ni iṣẹ nibi daradara.
He is always there.	O wa nigbagbogbo nibẹ.
However, there are ways around this.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ọna wa ni ayika eyi.
Now if you love it, great.	Bayi ti o ba nifẹ rẹ, nla.
Their application is outdated.	Ohun elo wọn jẹ igba atijọ.
They called me.	Wọn pe mi.
And as you say.	Ati bi o ti sọ.
He starts work at his new job tomorrow.	O bẹrẹ iṣẹ ni iṣẹ tuntun rẹ ni ọla.
They know me well enough now to understand me.	Wọn mọ mi daradara to bayi lati loye mi.
I can do this little thing for you.	Mo le ṣe nkan kekere yii fun ọ.
I think it made me a better world.	Mo ro pe o ṣe mi kan aye ti o dara.
However let him know the truth.	Sibẹsibẹ jẹ ki o mọ otitọ.
Now wait a minute here.	Bayi duro iṣẹju kan nibi.
It works at the expense of energy.	O ṣiṣẹ ni owo ti agbara.
This will do two things.	Eyi yoo ṣe awọn nkan meji.
What do you have to say about that ?.	Kini o ni lati sọ nipa iyẹn?.
These are our favorite shoes ever.	Awọn wọnyi ni awọn bata ayanfẹ wa lailai.
You always have a good idea.	O nigbagbogbo ni imọran ti o dara.
Clothing is easy to help with.	Aṣọ jẹ rọrun lati ran pẹlu.
Some are on the field, some miss the field.	Diẹ ninu awọn wa lori aaye, diẹ ninu padanu aaye naa.
I took a moment to stop myself.	Mo gba akoko kan lati da ara mi duro.
The time has come.	Akoko ti o wa.
Stay tuned.	Duro si i.
If possible, today yourself.	Ti o ba ṣeeṣe, loni funrararẹ.
He is a man.	Ọkunrin ni.
They do not think it can happen.	Wọn ko ro pe o le ṣẹlẹ.
What a great song you made.	Iru orin nla ti o ṣe.
He can no longer accept his inner thoughts.	Ko le gba awọn ero inu rẹ mọ mọ.
Die for a simple reason.	Ku fun idi kan rọrun.
He is on his way, promising.	O wa lori ọna rẹ, ileri.
Also have pictures of that.	Tun ni awọn aworan ti ti.
She seemed very happy.	O dabi enipe inu ara rẹ dun pupọ.
He is also very good at football.	O tun dara julọ ni bọọlu.
He asked why they were important.	O beere idi ti wọn ṣe pataki.
Whatever the reason, it is bad.	Ohunkohun ti idi rẹ, o jẹ buburu.
Think about the state of your life.	Ronu ni ipo ti igbesi aye rẹ.
I thought it myself.	Mo ti ro ti o ara mi.
Call for moments.	Pe fun awọn akoko.
Best possible.	Dara julọ ṣee ṣe.
And it's good and there are a lot of stories.	Ati pe o dara ati pe ọpọlọpọ awọn itan wa.
That would be nice, you know.	Iyẹn yoo dara, o mọ.
It works great.	O n ṣiṣẹ nla.
It 's pretty amazing to think about that.	O jẹ iyalẹnu lẹwa lati ronu nipa iyẹn.
You turn off the lights.	O pa awọn ina.
It may not have been the best day for you.	Ko le ti jẹ ọjọ ti o dara julọ fun rẹ.
I would probably agree with that position.	Emi yoo jasi gba pẹlu ipo yẹn.
Many of you can not.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ti o ko le.
I try to think it through.	Mo gbiyanju lati ro o nipasẹ.
It is not a small task.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ kekere kan.
Home concerts are nothing new.	Awọn ere orin ile kii ṣe nkan tuntun.
In clothes, you are right.	Ninu aṣọ, o tọ.
I told him all this.	Mo sọ gbogbo eyi fun u.
This problem is very important to me.	Iṣoro yii ṣe pataki pupọ fun mi.
I can't make it out.	Emi ko le ṣe jade.
I stopped talking to the woman.	Mo duro n ba obinrin sọrọ.
You didn't tell me.	Iwọ ko sọ fun mi.
And people can’t say what they can’t think of.	Ati pe awọn eniyan ko le sọ ohun ti wọn ko le ronu.
We love how beautiful it is, especially.	A nifẹ bi o ṣe lẹwa, paapaa.
But we know exactly what is happening.	Ṣugbọn a mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ gaan.
The book explains how to do this.	Iwe naa ṣe alaye bi o ṣe le ṣe eyi.
Let him go and pick me up.	Jẹ ki o lọ mu mi.
But the last few days have not been good enough.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọjọ diẹ ti o kẹhin ko ti dara to.
The man would run like a scared kid.	Ọkunrin naa yoo sare bi ọmọde ti o bẹru.
If you can.	Ti o ba le.
And opened and locked the door for him.	Ati ṣi ati ti ilẹkun fun u.
I want to know you better.	Mo fẹ lati mọ ọ daradara.
He didn't want to, he thought.	Ko fẹ, o ro.
Here is my new story.	Eyi ni itan tuntun mi.
If you can do such, it would look great.	Ti o ba le ṣe iru, yoo dabi nla.
Tomorrow will be a day.	Ọla yoo jẹ ọjọ kan.
I was thinking how to do this.	Mo ti ronu bi o ṣe le ṣiṣẹ eyi.
Word out.	Ọrọ ti jade.
He had no time at all.	Ko si ni akoko rara.
They don’t have to be for long.	Wọn ko ni lati wa fun igba pipẹ.
The most important thing.	Ohun ti o ṣe pataki julọ.
I was just completely honest with him.	Mo ti wà o kan patapata mọ pẹlu rẹ.
We consider two classes of service cost.	A ro meji kilasi ti iye owo iṣẹ.
And that’s fine with me.	Ati pe iyẹn dara pẹlu mi.
I could'.	Mo le'.
How they got me back.	Bawo ni wọn ṣe gba mi pada.
This, however, did not.	Eyi, sibẹsibẹ, ko ṣe.
Place the upper strap below the lower strap.	Gbe okun oke ni isalẹ okun ti isalẹ.
The book is there.	Iwe naa wa.
Where we sit is where we sit.	Ibi ti a joko ni ibi ti a joko.
What it is, and what it means.	Kini o jẹ, ati kini o tumọ si.
Neither parent is home.	Bẹni obi ni ile.
Just say so.	O kan sọ bẹ.
Now, good.	Ni bayi, o dara.
Nice to have it here.	O dara lati ni i nibi.
You already said.	O ti sọ tẹlẹ.
Let me see it.	Jẹ ki n ri i.
It doesn't hurt.	Ko dun.
Or maybe you just left.	Tabi boya o kan fi silẹ.
Do you always insist on doing all the work yourself?	Ṣe o nigbagbogbo ta ku lori ṣiṣe gbogbo iṣẹ funrararẹ?
I promise you are good.	Mo ṣe ileri pe o dara.
What will you do in the future?	Kini iwọ yoo ṣe ni ojo iwaju?
I did this.	Mo ti ṣe eyi.
We believe in our voice.	A gbagbọ ninu ohun wa.
Okay, let’s look at those values.	O dara, jẹ ki a wo awọn iye yẹn.
And you don’t.	Ati pe iwọ ko.
We have some talk to do, about this.	A ni diẹ ninu sọrọ lati ṣe, nipa eyi.
You will never see it again.	O yoo ko ri lẹẹkansi.
And the application continues to exist.	Ati pe ohun elo naa tẹsiwaju lati wa.
It is the right material.	O jẹ ohun elo ti o tọ.
For your past, or your future.	Fun igba atijọ rẹ, tabi ọjọ iwaju rẹ.
Go back and do three.	Pada ki o ṣe mẹta.
I want to see for myself.	Mo fe lati ri fun ara mi.
Just about everyone carries the news.	O kan nipa gbogbo eniyan ni o gbe iroyin naa.
But because they are not, they can change.	Ṣugbọn nitori wọn kii ṣe, wọn le yipada.
We may not do anything that is left over in history books.	A le ma ṣe nkan ti o lọ silẹ ninu awọn iwe itan.
He leaves the office every day today.	O jade kuro ni ọfiisi ni gbogbo ọjọ loni.
I can also make metal.	Mo tun le ṣe irin.
Or talking to the wrong people.	Tabi sọrọ si awọn eniyan ti ko tọ.
He did not know why he would leave us.	Ko mọ idi ti oun yoo fi wa.
So you have another world.	Nitorina o ni aye miiran.
It was hard to wait.	O jẹ gidigidi lati duro.
No one for any reason.	Ko si ẹnikẹni fun eyikeyi idi.
You know that place is lunch every day.	O mọ pe ibi ti o jẹ ounjẹ ọsan ni gbogbo ọjọ.
This is the key to making things easier.	Eyi ni bọtini lati jẹ ki awọn nkan rọrun.
It was a job for the world.	O je kan ise fun aye.
There are two main reasons for this.	Awọn idi meji lo wa fun ṣiṣe iyẹn.
It should be washed every day.	O yẹ ki o fo ni gbogbo ọjọ.
It is more than physical.	O ju ti ara lọ.
I'm not sure that's true.	Emi ko ni idaniloju pe otitọ ni iyẹn.
Some like to buy everything in a store.	Diẹ ninu awọn fẹran lati ra gbogbo nkan ni ile itaja kan.
The two do not look alike.	Awọn mejeeji ko dabi ara wọn.
Soon, they will know where they went wrong.	Laipẹ, wọn yoo mọ ibi ti wọn ti ṣe aṣiṣe.
Let's just say that once paid for it off.	Jẹ ká kan sọ wipe ni kete ti san fun pa rẹ.
It was a little warm, but still tasty.	O gbona diẹ, ṣugbọn o tun dun.
This is work.	Eleyi jẹ iṣẹ.
They refuse to return.	Wọn kọ lati pada.
It is iron.	Irin ni.
Or maybe minutes.	Tabi boya iṣẹju.
You have to do this.	O ni lati ṣe eyi.
He gave me money.	O fun mi ni owo.
You walk around, try them out.	O rin ni ayika, gbiyanju wọn jade.
But we love things growing.	Ṣugbọn a nifẹ awọn nkan dagba.
I want to live in that house.	Mo fe lati gbe ni ile yẹn.
Or many of them.	Tabi ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn.
It would be nice not to carry it anymore.	Yoo dara pupọ lati ma gbe e mọ.
I'm not angry at all.	Emi ko binu rara.
It is worth noting.	O tọ akiyesi.
You can let yourself out.	O le jẹ ki ara rẹ jade.
At least, not too much.	O kere ju, kii ṣe pupọ.
Do not force the person to ask.	Maṣe fi agbara mu ẹni ti a beere lọwọ rẹ.
The river that flooded the city.	Odo ti o di omi ti ya ilu naa.
Now is when we need them.	Bayi ni nigba ti a nilo wọn.
There is no time to worry about that right now.	Ko si akoko lati ṣe aniyan nipa iyẹn ni bayi.
But do not say anything.	Ṣugbọn maṣe sọ ohunkohun.
This is especially true of trains.	Eyi jẹ otitọ paapaa ti awọn ọkọ oju irin.
She saw her work as a small child.	O ri iṣẹ rẹ bi ọmọde kekere.
It’s always the same with a special meeting, of course.	O jẹ nigbagbogbo kanna pẹlu ipade pataki kan, dajudaju.
But that has not changed at all.	Ṣugbọn ko ti yipada rara.
You can still stay at my house.	O tun le duro ni ile mi.
He wants to go out.	O fe jade.
He told me it meant everything to you.	O sọ fun mi pe o tumọ si ohun gbogbo fun ọ.
More than your stories tell anyone.	Diẹ sii ju awọn itan rẹ sọ fun ẹnikẹni.
But they are not enough.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko to.
We can hope.	A le nireti.
You have to make your decision.	O gbọdọ ṣe ipinnu rẹ.
If so, you will be wrong.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, iwọ yoo jẹ aṣiṣe.
I was a little small.	Mi wà kekere kan kekere.
He does not know what it means.	Ko mọ ohun ti o tumọ si.
Contact.	Kan si.
Let's move on !.	Jẹ ki a tẹsiwaju!.
Plans have been under way for years.	Awọn eto ti wa labẹ ọna fun ọdun.
I asked him to read back what he had written.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ lati ka ohun ti o kọ pada.
He did not sleep for hours.	O ko sun fun wakati.
I do not love the law.	Nko ni ife fun ofin.
That's a lot.	Pupo niyen.
The company has its headquarters in this area.	Ile-iṣẹ naa ni ile-iṣẹ rẹ ni agbegbe yii.
Now we give them food.	Bayi a fun wọn ni ounjẹ.
I always have people in my house.	Mo nigbagbogbo ni eniyan ni ile mi.
I think they are very good.	Mo ro pe wọn dara pupọ.
I usually have that problem too.	Mo maa ni iṣoro yẹn paapaa.
Any child with a food box knows this.	Eyikeyi ọmọ ti o ni apoti ounjẹ kan mọ eyi.
Words are recognized by the company they store.	Awọn ọrọ ni a mọ nipasẹ ile-iṣẹ ti wọn tọju.
This is done.	Eyi ti a ṣe.
It sounds great to me.	O dun mi nla.
Some of these people seem to be friends.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan wọnyi dabi ọrẹ.
Bring our company if you want.	Mu ile-iṣẹ wa ti o ba fẹ.
His face did not reveal their age.	Oju rẹ ko fi ọjọ ori wọn han.
It's beautiful.	O lẹwa.
I will miss you.	Emi yoo padanu rẹ.
I have things to do.	Mo ni awọn nkan lati ṣe.
He looked up.	O wo si oke.
I told them that a father was holding my hand.	Mo sọ fun wọn pe baba mi kan di ọwọ mi mu.
Tell me what you want.	Sọ fun mi ohun ti o fẹ.
We tested it last year.	A ṣe idanwo idanwo ni ọdun to kọja.
These are always men.	Awọn wọnyi jẹ awọn ọkunrin nigbagbogbo.
Sometimes this tree dies.	Nigba miiran igi yii ku.
You don’t let me touch it.	O ko jẹ ki n fi ọwọ kan rẹ.
It is fast down the road.	O wa ni sare si isalẹ ni opopona.
We spend our whole lives working like this.	A lo gbogbo aye wa ṣiṣẹ bi eleyi.
It comes from the police.	O wa lati ọdọ ọlọpa.
That is difficult to test.	Iyẹn nira lati ṣe idanwo.
They have received a lot of attention for a number of reasons.	Wọn ti gba akiyesi pupọ nitori awọn idi pupọ.
Meet in public place.	Pade ni gbangba ibi.
Okay, you know.	O dara, o mọ.
That is very important.	Nkan pataki niyen.
I stopped the car.	Mo duro ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
That’s an amazing group of people in that industry.	Iyẹn jẹ ẹgbẹ iyanu ti eniyan ni ile-iṣẹ yẹn.
It was impossible for me to understand.	Ko ṣee ṣe fun mi lati ni oye.
We will not talk about it now.	A kii yoo sọrọ nipa rẹ ni bayi.
That is why it is important.	Ti o ni idi eyi jẹ pataki.
That was some of the first words we wrote.	Iyẹn jẹ diẹ ninu awọn ọrọ akọkọ ti a kọ.
It arrived a little early.	O ti de ni kutukutu diẹ.
It just can’t let it hit you.	O kan ko le jẹ ki o lu ọ.
There are many stories to tell.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn itan wa lati sọ.
Pick up again.	Gbe soke lẹẹkansi.
And for good reason.	Ati fun idi ti o dara.
Not sure how that helps.	Ko daju bi iyẹn ṣe ṣe iranlọwọ.
One day we may find what we are looking for.	Ni ọjọ kan a le rii ohun ti a n wa.
This may be a little more important.	Eyi le ṣe pataki diẹ diẹ.
There are shops on the road.	Awọn ile itaja wa ni opopona.
They are worth seeing.	Wọn tọ lati rii.
It is not intended to.	O ko ti pinnu lati.
I am not afraid.	Emi ko bẹru.
I think we need them both.	Mo ro pe a nilo wọn mejeeji.
My sister hates me.	Arabinrin mi korira mi.
I rejected it.	Mo kọ ọ silẹ.
Can't remember your name.	Ko le ranti orukọ rẹ.
We have nothing to eat.	A ko ni nkankan lati jẹ.
Do not drink and drive.	Maṣe mu ati wakọ.
The body does not.	Ara kọ.
So we waited, for what we could do.	Nitorina a duro, fun ohun ti a le ṣe.
Your true name.	Orukọ otitọ rẹ.
He refused to give their names.	O kọ lati fun orukọ wọn.
There was no one to keep me there.	Ko si ẹnikan lati tọju mi ​​nibẹ.
But this did not happen.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko ṣẹlẹ.
I do not know how to drink.	Emi ko mọ bi mo ṣe le mu.
I wouldn’t want you to get into any trouble about that.	Emi kii yoo fẹ ki o wọ inu wahala eyikeyi nipa iyẹn.
You understand it only outside.	O loye rẹ nikan ni ita.
He kept his hands on the table.	O si pa awọn ọwọ rẹ lori tabili.
I think they know that.	Mo ro pe wọn mọ iyẹn.
We love it so much.	A nifẹ rẹ pupọ.
Switch to a room you just want to leave.	Yipada si yara ti o fẹ kan kuro.
The water looks amazing.	Omi naa dabi iyanu.
But that’s something you live for.	Sugbon ti o ni nkankan ti o gbe fun.
I made you see it.	Mo mu ki o le wo o.
And nothing.	Ati pe ko si nkankan.
I don’t have to decide right now.	Emi ko ni lati pinnu ni bayi.
You have to become one of the first members of the team.	O ni lati di ọkan ninu awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ akọkọ ti ẹgbẹ naa.
Go up and return to the previous point.	Lọ soke ki o pada si aaye ti tẹlẹ.
At this point, her mother may have passed.	Ni aaye yii, iya rẹ le ti kọja.
You have one.	O ni ọkan.
Often, what we have to do in this life.	Nigbagbogbo, ohun ti a ni lati ṣe ni igbesi aye yii.
I ask you.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ.
I would say so.	Emi yoo sọ bẹ.
I'm glad to be back.	Inu mi dun lati pada wa.
I decided to try this.	Mo pinnu lati gbiyanju eyi.
You know nothing about it.	O ko mọ nkankan nipa rẹ.
She tried to let him go.	O gbiyanju lati jẹ ki o lọ.
He died at his side.	O ku ni ẹgbẹ rẹ.
Okay, it doesn't matter.	O dara, ko ṣe pataki.
We will eat at my store.	A o jẹun ni ile itaja mi.
I saw what he did for you.	Mo ti rii ohun ti o ṣe fun ọ.
I look like a dying man.	Mo dabi ẹni ti o ku ni ọdọ.
Don't talk like that.	Maṣe sọrọ bi iyẹn.
It’s the same way in football, he said.	O jẹ ọna kanna ni bọọlu, o sọ.
I like it here.	Mo feran nibi.
In the end, it takes time.	Ni ipari, o gba akoko.
People do not always know what they need.	Awọn eniyan ko nigbagbogbo mọ ohun ti wọn nilo.
Or marriage.	Tabi igbeyawo.
Don't really remember.	Maṣe ranti gaan.
Everything is possible for the moment.	Ohun gbogbo ṣee ṣe fun akoko.
Of course his mother did not want this to happen.	Dajudaju iya rẹ ko fẹ ki eyi ṣẹlẹ.
It has nothing.	Ko ni nkankan.
It's time for me to leave now.	O to akoko fun mi lati lọ kuro ni bayi.
I miss you dad.	Mo padanu re baba.
I'm very happy.	Inu mi kan dun.
Spend two hours in the sun.	Lo wakati meji ni oorun.
I met a lot of great people.	Mo pade ọpọlọpọ eniyan nla.
That's fine, man.	O dara yẹn, eniyan.
The dog is very important.	Aja ṣe pataki pupọ.
I will not be the same person in this area.	Emi kii yoo jẹ eniyan kanna ni agbegbe yii.
The sister was always very confident.	Arabinrin naa ni idaniloju pupọ nigbagbogbo.
He is strong enough to die.	O ni agbara to lati ku.
Don't look like someone is doing that.	Maṣe dabi ẹni pe ẹnikan n ṣe iyẹn.
It was time for this group to change rooms.	O jẹ akoko ti ẹgbẹ yii ni lati yi awọn yara pada.
It's fast now.	O yara ni bayi.
I will get a new job.	Emi yoo gba iṣẹ tuntun kan.
We have been together ever since.	A ti wa papọ lati igba naa.
The streets are full of people today.	Awọn opopona kun fun eniyan loni.
I have refused to accept any of that money.	Mo ti kọ lati gba eyikeyi ninu owo yẹn.
The application is written.	Ohun elo naa ti kọ.
They will want to know why, and they will ask you.	Wọn yoo fẹ lati mọ idi rẹ, ati pe wọn yoo beere lọwọ rẹ.
Too late now, so he did his best in it.	Ju pẹ ni bayi, nitorina o ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ ninu rẹ.
We do not know what to do about it.	A ko mọ kini lati ṣe nipa rẹ.
The time to catch up turned into night.	Akoko lati yẹ soke yipada si alẹ.
You look at the store.	O wo ile itaja.
I can't say if they still work.	Emi ko le sọ boya wọn tun ṣiṣẹ.
Love who you are.	Ni ife ti o ba wa ni.
I love people like that.	Mo nifẹ awọn eniyan bi iyẹn.
Or maybe just a lot of people.	Tabi boya o kan ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan.
I do not know where I started.	Emi ko mọ ibiti mo ti bẹrẹ.
And it was a mistake.	Ati pe o jẹ aṣiṣe.
The two met.	Awọn mejeeji pade.
I sit around and wait for something to change.	Mo joko ni ayika ati ki o duro fun nkankan lati yi.
It has nothing to do with any of these companies.	Ko ni nkan ṣe pẹlu eyikeyi awọn ile-iṣẹ wọnyi.
Something has to be.	Nkankan ni lati wa.
I agree that.	Mo gba pe.
Often they don’t.	Nigbagbogbo wọn ko ni.
But, you need to meet them.	Ṣugbọn, o nilo lati pade wọn.
No one has seen or heard anything.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ti ri tabi ti gbọ ohunkohun.
Yours is the choice.	Tirẹ ni ti o ba fẹ.
I did not do it again.	Emi ko tun ṣe.
Look around you.	Wo ni ayika rẹ.
And for good reason.	Ati fun awọn idi ti o dara.
The boy used that time to break his shoes.	Ọmọkunrin naa lo akoko naa lati fọ bata rẹ.
Childbirth while the husband is away.	Ibi ọmọ nigba ti ọkọ kuro.
I need to see it.	Mo ni lati ri i.
Now she is wearing a dress.	Bayi o ti wọ aṣọ kan.
He sat at the edge of the table.	O joko lori tabili eti.
You never know what to think or feel.	O ko mọ kini lati ronu tabi rilara.
But he asked me.	Ṣugbọn o beere lọwọ mi.
Not a big advantage.	Ko kan anfani nla.
I mean the other way around.	Mo tumọ si ọna miiran.
That is something that one does not understand.	Nkan ti eniyan ko loye niyen.
You have that much, if any more.	O ni ọrọ pupọ yẹn, ti o ba jẹ diẹ miiran.
I'm not happy about it.	Inu mi ko dun nipa rẹ.
They don’t need to be friends.	Wọn ko nilo lati jẹ ọrẹ.
There is no place to walk anymore, you know.	Ko si aaye lati rin mọ, o mọ.
It has to be bad to let something good cost something.	O ni lati jẹ buburu lati jẹ ki ohun ti o dara tọ nkankan.
Those you can laugh with without good reason.	Awọn ti o le rẹrin pẹlu laisi idi to dara.
Definitely not saying.	O daju ko sọ.
People did not notice him and his parents and brother hated him.	Awọn eniyan ko ṣe akiyesi rẹ ati awọn obi ati arakunrin rẹ korira rẹ.
I should never have read the books at all.	Emi ko yẹ ki o ti ka awọn iwe naa rara.
He lives.	O ngbe.

However, his words worried me.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ọrọ rẹ ṣe aniyan mi.
Friends, he thought to himself.	Awọn ọrẹ, o ronu si ara rẹ.
Don't throw yourself out of it.	Maṣe sọ ara rẹ kuro ninu rẹ.

He didn't seem to be afraid of her at all.	O dabi ẹni pe ko bẹru rẹ paapaa.

Maybe there is also.	Boya o tun wa.
Going to a few meetings like that.	Ti lọ si awọn ipade diẹ bi iyẹn.
Of the people you know.	Ti awọn eniyan ti o mọ.
That's what he gave her.	Ohun ti o fun u niyẹn.
You better be honest.	O dara ki o wa mọ.
Maybe they think they can live with it.	Boya wọn ro pe wọn le gbe pẹlu rẹ.
I saw it in the attic.	Mo ti ri ninu oke aja.
But that doesn't mean he can't watch.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko tumọ si pe ko le wo.
They have nothing of the kind.	Wọn ko ni nkankan ti iru.
I have nothing to do.	Nko ni nkankan lati se.
He refused to talk to me.	O kọ lati ba mi sọrọ.
He always thought of ways to help people.	O nigbagbogbo ronu awọn ọna lati ran eniyan lọwọ.
It would be nice if we had more years together.	Yoo ti dara julọ ti a ba ni awọn ọdun diẹ sii papọ.
He did the first tests.	O ṣe awọn idanwo akọkọ.

And it continues to change.	Ati ki o tẹsiwaju lati yipada.

We see the power of people.	A ri agbara ti awọn eniyan.
I need to work a few tasks.	Mo nilo lati ṣiṣẹ awọn iṣẹ diẹ.
They couldn’t laugh at me.	Wọn ko le rẹrin si mi.

I enjoyed the trip, you see.	Mo gbadun irin-ajo, o rii.
Do your job.	Ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.

In love.	Ninu ife.
Don't get me started!	Maṣe gba mi bẹrẹ!
I take to the beach.	Mo ya lọ si eti okun.
A few years ago, there were no houses standing here.	Ni ọdun diẹ sẹhin, ko si awọn ile ti o duro nibi.
His father knew the place.	Baba rẹ mọ ibi naa.
Want to do the same thing.	Fẹ lati ṣe ohun kanna.
No need to talk.	Ko nilo lati sọrọ.
And their plan did not work today.	Ati pe eto wọn ko ṣe loni.
We will talk to him.	A yoo ba a sọrọ.
I’m not sure that makes sense to me.	Emi ko ni idaniloju pe iyẹn jẹ oye si mi.
Please can someone help me.	Jọwọ ṣe ẹnikan le ran mi lọwọ.
We got up early the next morning.	A dide ni kutukutu owurọ owurọ.
And just remember, it's doing great.	Ati ki o kan ranti, o n ṣe nla.
Good help back to the cars.	Ti o dara ran pada si awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
I'm sure you know that.	Mo da ọ loju pe o mọ iyẹn.
I don’t know anything of your life.	Emi ko mọ nkankan ti igbesi aye rẹ.
Children have to dress up for school.	Awọn ọmọde ti ni lati wọ aṣọ si ile-iwe.
We have enough wood to hit a boat.	A ni igi ti o to lati kan ọkọ oju omi kan.
You never lose your time or money in doing so.	O ko padanu akoko tabi owo rẹ ni ṣiṣe bẹ.
Many children enjoy being together.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde gbadun papọ.
It gives us this opportunity.	O fun wa ni anfani yi.
Can you find it?	O le ri rẹ?
He stopped and looked at me for a long time.	O duro o si wo mi fun igba pipẹ.
You are not a child.	Iwọ kii ṣe ọmọde.
Over time, this can be harmful.	Lori akoko, eyi le jẹ ipalara.
Or where we are doing.	Tabi ibi ti a ti n ṣe.
They have no way of calling the letter a.	Wọn ko ni ọna lati pe lẹta naa a.
But something was wrong.	Sugbon nkankan je ti ko tọ.
A le da.	A le da.
But he can’t worry about that right now.	Ṣugbọn oun ko le ṣe aniyan nipa iyẹn ni bayi.
You want a drink.	O fẹ a mimu.
We have your power.	A ni agbara rẹ.
We looked at it for a very long time.	A ṣe oju ni pipẹ pupọ.
We cannot continue to live in the past.	A ko le tẹsiwaju lati gbe ni igba atijọ.
They are not men.	Wọn kii ṣe ọkunrin.
And a brother.	Ati arakunrin kan.
I will be at noon.	Emi yoo wa ni ọsan.
This is not an accident.	Eyi kii ṣe ijamba.
Good to throw out.	O dara lati ju jade.
They climb the tallest trees.	Wọn gun awọn igi ti o ga julọ.
They are often called by our first names.	Nigbagbogbo wọn pe wa nipasẹ awọn orukọ akọkọ wa.
They are my life.	Wọn jẹ igbesi aye mi.
For a moment, he seemed surprised.	Fun iṣẹju kan, o dabi ẹni ti o ya.
I'm tired too.	Emi naa ti re mi.
It contains our details.	O ni awọn alaye wa.
He dropped the last few feet.	O lọ silẹ awọn ẹsẹ diẹ ti o kẹhin.
This gets old fast.	Eleyi gba atijọ sare.
You look around.	O wo ni ayika.
But he did not allow that to happen.	Ṣugbọn ko jẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ.
And it doesn’t seem like you have a lot of time for people who don’t.	Ati pe o ko dabi pe o ni akoko pupọ fun awọn eniyan ti ko ṣe.
I should move.	Mo yẹ ki o gbe.
To continue with your life.	Lati tẹsiwaju pẹlu igbesi aye rẹ.
Think, woman, think.	Ronu, obinrin, ronu.
I don’t touch her, nor do I touch her.	Emi ko kan rẹ, tabi ko kan mi.
You know, it sounds good when you have to.	O mọ, o dun daradara nigbati o ni lati.
Try not to wait until the last minute.	Gbiyanju lati ma duro titi di iṣẹju ti o kẹhin.
A very well written explanation.	A gan daradara kọ alaye.
I’ve seen him think about it.	Mo ti ri i ro nipa o.
He will travel this route to the city.	Oun yoo rin irin-ajo ni ọna yii si ilu.
There we passed through them.	Nibẹ ni a kọja nipasẹ wọn.
Or not.	Tabi ko ṣe.
He will always go.	Oun yoo ma lọ.
Maybe he can’t stand it himself.	Boya ko le duro funrararẹ.
Not sure why.	Ko daju idi.
I also want to try.	Mo tun fẹ gbiyanju.
I can't help but feel for him.	Emi ko le ran sugbon lero fun u.
Again, not a problem.	Lẹẹkansi, kii ṣe iṣoro.
That is their life, that is their life.	Iyẹn ni igbesi aye wọn, iyẹn ni igbesi aye wọn.
Everything is going as planned.	Ohun gbogbo ti n lọ bi a ti pinnu.
You will not last long if you take it to one.	Iwọ kii yoo pẹ to ti o ba mu lọ si ọkan.
Even he was killed by it.	Paapaa o ti pa nipasẹ rẹ.
It was the morning of the weekend.	O jẹ owurọ ti ipari.
After three hours, he arrived.	Lẹhin wakati mẹta, o de.
That's the way things work.	Iyẹn ni ọna ti awọn nkan ṣe ṣiṣẹ.
I try to mean.	Mo gbiyanju lati tumọ si.
There are a few people in there.	Awọn eniyan diẹ wa ninu.
But he stayed with her.	Ṣugbọn o duro pẹlu rẹ.
Know every man.	Mọ gbogbo ọkunrin.
There are several reasons why we have to turn off the phone.	O jẹ idi pupọ ti a ni lati pa foonu naa.
He had already planned every minute of their vacation.	O ti gbero tẹlẹ ni gbogbo iṣẹju ti isinmi wọn.
If you still feel the same you can go.	Ti o ba tun lero kanna o le lọ.
We are working.	A n ṣiṣẹ.
They fear that they will die if they stop.	Wọn bẹru pe wọn yoo ku ti wọn ba duro.
I have been expressing my love for more than a year.	Mo ti mu ifẹ mi jade fun diẹ sii ju ọdun kan lọ.
I tried it for the first time yesterday.	Mo gbiyanju o fun igba akọkọ lana.
And those people have agreed with.	Ati pe awọn eniyan yẹn ti gba pẹlu.
The other for the past two seasons.	Awọn miiran fun awọn ti o ti kọja meji akoko.
Pretty easy job to have.	Lẹwa rọrun iṣẹ lati ni.
We need to think about that when something big happens.	A nilo lati ronu nipa iyẹn nigbati nkan nla ba ṣẹlẹ.
Best to insert to use.	Dara julọ lati fi sii lati lo.
Weeks turn into months and months into years.	Awọn ọsẹ yipada si awọn oṣu ati awọn oṣu sinu ọdun.
He knows he can bring us when we need to.	O mọ pe o le mu wa nigbati o nilo lati.
It's too sweet.	Ko dun ju.
You have to start in yourself.	O ni lati bẹrẹ ninu ara rẹ.
Life here can.	Igbesi aye nibi le.
Everyone knows what matters most.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ ohun ti o ṣe pataki julọ.
However, no decision was made on that question.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko si ipinnu ti a ṣe lori ibeere yẹn.
You must take good care of it.	O gbọdọ tọju rẹ daradara.
Or maybe some people are looking at the wrong places.	Tabi boya awọn eniyan kan n wo awọn aaye ti ko tọ.
I will talk to him soon.	Emi yoo ba a sọrọ laipẹ.
I mean the last minute before the thought left me forever.	Mo tumọ si iṣẹju to kẹhin ṣaaju ki ero naa fi mi silẹ lailai.
I do not know where that came from, but it is.	Emi ko mọ ibiti iyẹn ti wa, ṣugbọn o wa.
Too late.	O ti pẹ ju.
Not his best face.	Kii ṣe oju rẹ ti o dara julọ.
You need great players.	O nilo awọn ẹrọ orin nla.
We have heard great things about the students.	A ti gbọ ohun nla nipa awọn ọmọ ile-iwe.
I want you to think something serious is happening.	Mo fẹ ki o ro pe nkan pataki kan n ṣẹlẹ.
Keep your book regularly.	Pa iwe rẹ nigbagbogbo.
But not you.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe iwọ.
There are very simple things you have to keep to one.	Awọn nkan ti o rọrun pupọ wa ti o ni lati tọju si ọkan.
No question arises.	Ko si ibeere ti o dide.
But no, that should not be.	Ṣugbọn rara, iyẹn ko yẹ.
So the timing is wrong, that is.	Nitorina akoko naa ko tọ, iyẹn ni.
But not much, not in the ways you think.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ, kii ṣe ni awọn ọna ti o ro.
You keep to yourself here.	O tọju ararẹ si ara rẹ nibi.
She thinks her son doesn’t like her.	O ro pe ọmọ rẹ ko fẹ oun.
Bad place.	Ibi buburu.
But still don’t let it go.	Ṣugbọn sibẹsibẹ ko jẹ ki o lọ.
And they are not the only ones.	Ati pe wọn kii ṣe awọn nikan.
Change your page.	Yi iwe rẹ pada.
They are always watching them.	Nigbagbogbo wọn n wo wọn.
She looked like a little girl growing up in front of them.	O dabi ọmọbirin kekere kan ti o dagba ni iwaju wọn.
He thinks a lot and not at all.	O n ronu pupọ ati kii ṣe rara.
We will be fine.	A yoo dara.
They will not call me to tell me that.	Wọn kii yoo pe mi lati sọ fun mi pe.
One can say something.	Ẹnikan le sọ nkankan.
I bought them completely.	Mo ti ra wọn patapata.
None of us can.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa le.
Sometimes it comes down to it.	Nigba miiran o wa ni isalẹ.
After a few days, the rain stopped.	Lẹhin awọn ọjọ diẹ, ojo duro.
Maybe you won’t hear from me for a while.	Boya o ko ni gbọ lati ọdọ mi fun igba diẹ.
But we have left a lot.	Ṣugbọn a ti fi silẹ pupọ.
But we went through it.	Sugbon a lọ nipasẹ o.
Others are not so much.	Awọn miiran ko bẹ pupọ.
The man must keep his mouth shut.	Ọkunrin naa gbọdọ pa ẹnu rẹ mọ́.
If you want to work for the office, run.	Ti o ba fẹ lati ṣiṣẹ fun ọfiisi, ṣiṣe.
Making a decision.	Ṣiṣe ipinnu ipinnu.
I know you well.	Mo mọ ọ daradara.
Okay, now we're done.	O dara, ni bayi a ti pari.
Obviously, it is a problem.	O han ni, o jẹ iṣoro kan.
But, of course, it does not.	Ṣugbọn, dajudaju, ko ṣe rara.
Not that way.	Kii ṣe ọna yẹn.
You have seen.	O ti ri.
He told me he would not pay me.	O so fun mi pe oun ko ni san owo fun mi.
Some of us are thinking about everything.	Diẹ ninu wa ni ero lori ohun gbogbo.
You see the kids in the game.	O wo awọn ọmọde ni ere.
They will be obvious.	Wọn yoo han gbangba.
He walked into the garden.	O rin sinu ọgba.
Not very good.	Ko ṣe daradara pupọ.
He asked to read.	O beere lati ka.
He promised me he would not say.	O ṣe ileri fun mi kii yoo sọ.
In my opinion, the dog lives.	Ni ero mi, aja ni o n gbe.
And there were other things.	Ati awọn ohun miiran wà.
Of course they are like it.	Dajudaju wọn dabi rẹ.
You must understand this.	O gbọdọ ni oye eyi.
I miss you and your mother so much.	Mo padanu iwọ ati iya rẹ gidigidi.
There was also surprise for me, it seemed.	Iyalẹnu tun wa fun mi, o dabi enipe.
I will learn hard.	Emi yoo kọ ẹkọ lile.
I know you have to be young.	Mo mọ pe o gbọdọ jẹ ọdọ.
They are out nicely.	Wọn ti wa ni jade dara.
Sorry you can't.	Ma binu o ko le ṣe.
They told me they wanted a woman, not a little girl.	Wọn sọ fun mi pe obinrin ni wọn fẹ, kii ṣe ọmọbirin kekere.
He broke his leg during the accident.	O fọ ẹsẹ rẹ nigba ijamba naa.
You will tell me yours.	Iwọ yoo sọ tirẹ fun mi.
We will have to wait until it goes down.	A yoo ni lati duro titi yoo fi lọ silẹ.
Water is coming out of it again.	Omi ti n jade lati ọdọ rẹ lẹẹkansi.
I have to travel again next week.	Mo ni lati rin irin-ajo lẹẹkansi ni ọsẹ to nbọ.
He came back.	O pada wa.
She turns her hand in purple.	O yi ọwọ rẹ ni eleyi ti.
They are worried and they need to get this baby out.	Wọn ṣe aniyan ati pe wọn nilo lati gba ọmọ yii jade.
He asked many questions.	O beere ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere.
There are two doors in the back.	Awọn ilẹkun meji wa ni ẹhin.
Get the money or charge them.	Gba owo naa tabi gba agbara si wọn.
We are not sure what happened that day.	A ko ni idaniloju ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni ọjọ yẹn.
For the last time.	Fun igba ikẹhin.
We don’t do or see everything there is to see.	A ko ṣe tabi rii ohun gbogbo ti o wa lati rii.
For the love you receive.	Fun ife ti o gba.
However we continue.	Sibẹsibẹ a tẹsiwaju.
But I am.	Sugbon emi.
He went on a road trip with a friend.	O lọ si irin-ajo opopona pẹlu ọrẹ kan.
I can't get any money.	Nko le gba owo kankan.
That is my question.	Ibeere mi niyen.
I do not know what to do.	Emi ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
It's time to dump her and move on.	O to akoko lati tun jade.
It gives way.	O n fun ni ọna.
But, for now, he can't do anything anymore.	Ṣugbọn, fun bayi, ko le ṣe ohunkohun mọ.
And if they see us, we will stop.	Ati pe ti wọn ba rii wa, a yoo da wa duro.
One way to your house.	Ọna kan lọ si ile rẹ.
Both are pilots.	Awọn mejeeji jẹ awakọ ọkọ ofurufu.
We did not move for two more days.	A ko gbe fun ọjọ meji si i.
Designed to last forever, they will never.	Ti a ṣe lati duro lailai, wọn kii yoo ṣe.

Go for the eyes, if you can.	Lọ fun awọn oju, ti o ba le.
The woman on the road always reads the newspaper.	Obinrin ti o wa ni opopona nigbagbogbo ka iwe iroyin.

We never slept.	A ko sun oorun kankan.
The doctors took a break.	Awọn dokita gba isinmi.
Sitting in the car.	Joko ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
Even after all that rain.	Paapaa lẹhin gbogbo ojo naa.
But he did not know his power.	Ṣugbọn o ko mọ agbara rẹ.
Most people who know him believe him.	Pupọ julọ awọn eniyan ti o mọ gbagbọ rẹ.
What are you looking for now? 	Kini o n wa bayi?

You may not believe you were about to do this, but.	O ko le gbagbọ o wà nipa lati ṣe eyi, ṣugbọn.
I have the plan.	Mo ni eto naa.
And there are situations like this, you know.	Ati awọn ipo bii eyi wa, o mọ.
Of course, it will not be long.	Dajudaju, kii yoo pẹ.
Would that be a good way ?.	Ṣe iyẹn yoo jẹ ọna ti o dara?.
That’s just my way.	Iyẹn nikan ni ọna mi.
It changed the world.	O yi aye pada.
Just a little more room to move.	O kan yara diẹ diẹ sii lati gbe.
It is impossible to hide.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati tọju.
See how far we have come.	Wo bi a ti ti de to.
This is not good.	Eyi ko dara.
It’s just a matter of time.	O jẹ ọrọ kan ti akoko nikan.
That has never happened to me.	Iyẹn ko ti ṣẹlẹ si mi rara.
You can watch these here and here.	O le wo awọn wọnyi nibi ati nibi.

You used to come and go.	O lo lati wa ati lọ.
It is over in days.	O ti pari ni awọn ọjọ.

And that goes for their parents, too.	Ati awọn ti o lọ fun awọn obi wọn, ju.
They just ask us to make good decisions.	Wọn kan beere lọwọ wa lati ṣe awọn ipinnu ti o dara.
Some have more details than others.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni awọn alaye diẹ sii ju awọn miiran lọ.
So worth it.	Nitorina tọ o.
All through the house.	Gbogbo nipasẹ ile.
Trees grow outside the city.	Awọn igi dagba ni ita ti ilu.
Get my information.	Gba alaye mi.
His speech was surprising.	Ọrọ rẹ jẹ ohun iyalẹnu.
He wonders whether it is yet better.	O ṣe iyalẹnu boya sibẹsibẹ o dara julọ.
I just can't.	Mi o kan ko le.
You should have used me now.	O yẹ ki o ti lo mi ni bayi.
I have asked him to come out with me next week.	Mo ti beere lọwọ rẹ lati jade pẹlu mi ni ọsẹ ti n bọ.
Not just the head.	Kii ṣe ori nikan.
Many old friends and some new ones have become instruments.	Pupọ awọn ọrẹ atijọ ati diẹ ninu awọn tuntun ti di ohun elo.
The tea is hot.	Tii naa ti gbona.
I see it every day.	Mo ti ri ni gbogbo ọjọ.
I can not stand on my own two feet.	Emi ko le duro lori ẹsẹ.
You have seen me.	O ti ri mi.
We must have fire.	Ina a gbọdọ ni.
Sorry to come back with you late.	Ma binu lati pada wa pẹlu rẹ pẹ.
They take the last one away.	Wọn gba eyi ti o kẹhin kuro.
Not from a woman.	Ko lati obinrin kan.
Nothing on the phone.	Ko si nkankan lori foonu.
They just know they do.	Wọn kan mọ pe wọn ṣe.
I have been doing this by my side.	Mo ti n ṣe eyi ni ẹgbẹ mi.
I have written about it before.	Mo ti kọ nipa rẹ tẹlẹ.
That is what they do most.	Ohun ti wọn ṣe julọ niyẹn.
For the most part, it works well.	Fun pupọ julọ, o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
He touched himself.	O fi ọwọ kan ara rẹ.
The men were in trouble.	Awọn ọkunrin wà ninu wahala.
Let’s hope it doesn’t take too long before we see it.	Jẹ ki a nireti pe ko pẹ pupọ ṣaaju ki a rii i.
The first thing he did was ask about my family.	Ohun akọkọ ti o ṣe ni beere nipa idile mi.
He forgot, and after two weeks he did nothing.	O gbagbe, ati lẹhin ọsẹ meji o ko ṣe ohunkohun.
Many citizens take this work seriously.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ara ilu gba iṣẹ yii ni pataki.
Just a little bit to everyone.	O kan diẹ diẹ si gbogbo eniyan.
We do not need to talk about that.	A ko nilo lati sọrọ nipa iyẹn.
Every week.	Ni gbogbo ọsẹ kan.
Hard decisions make it easy.	Awọn ipinnu lile ṣe rọrun.
Who is the man who comes home?	Ta ni ọkunrin ti o ba wa si ile?
Everyone loves a simple life.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹran igbesi aye ti o rọrun.
I'm very happy.	Inu mi dun pupo.
I am not you.	Emi kii ṣe iwọ.
Some communities do not accept the program.	Diẹ ninu awọn agbegbe ko gba eto naa.
We can do it again.	A le tun ṣe.
He immersed himself in it.	O fi ara rẹ bọ inu rẹ.
I am very happy to help.	Inu mi dun pupọ lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
Their children do not like them.	Awọn ọmọ wọn ko fẹran wọn.
It did a good job.	O ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara.
Our situation has changed now.	Nkan wa ti yipada ni bayi.
You ask good, hard questions.	O beere ti o dara, awọn ibeere lile.
Do what you can.	Ṣe ohun ti o le.
I was the only woman in the room.	Emi nikan ni obinrin ninu yara.
But he does not know how much time he has.	Ṣugbọn ko mọ iye akoko ti o ni.
Something is wrong with the city.	Nkankan jẹ aṣiṣe pupọ ni ilu naa.
However, these are not available.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn wọnyi ko wa.
This is what it looks like to die.	Eyi ni ohun ti o dabi lati ku.
I seem to be in trouble all the time now.	Mo dabi ẹni pe o ni wahala ni gbogbo igba bayi.
You will only go for a day or so.	Iwọ yoo lọ nikan fun ọjọ kan tabi bii.
The device has the ability to perform many tasks.	Ẹrọ naa ni agbara lati ṣe awọn iṣẹ pupọ.
We work as a team that has been together for years.	A ṣiṣẹ bi ẹgbẹ kan ti o ti wa papọ fun ọdun.
Education is a rewarding career.	Ẹkọ jẹ iṣẹ ti o ni ere.
However we have to make sure we do.	Sibẹsibẹ a ni lati rii daju pe a ṣe.
We do not need anyone to ask us.	A ko nilo ẹnikẹni lati beere wa.
He took his hand in it.	O si mu ọwọ rẹ ninu rẹ.
However, at this time, there is no place to run.	Sibẹsibẹ, ni akoko yii, ko si aaye lati sare.
It looks great.	O wo nla.
It could be wrong.	O le jẹ aṣiṣe.
He grabbed the edge of the table to lower himself.	O di eti tabili mu lati ba ara rẹ silẹ.
You are not alone.	O le ma wa paapaa.
It is as true as thought.	O jẹ otitọ bi ero.
It helps me.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi.
It's been a while.	O ti pẹ diẹ.
I love many books.	Mo nifẹ awọn iwe pupọ.
There must be something you can do to help your friends.	Ohun kan gbọdọ wa ti o le ṣe lati ran awọn ọrẹ rẹ lọwọ.
But of course it will not.	Sugbon dajudaju o yoo ko.
I love to love.	Mo nifẹ lati nifẹ.
About a lot of things.	Nipa ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
I will not put my hand on it.	Emi ko ni gbe ọwọ mi le e.
Also known as my people.	Tun mo bi eniyan mi.
They wrote many old folk songs.	Wọn kọ ọpọlọpọ awọn orin eniyan atijọ.
It was the first time his company worked with the application.	O jẹ igba akọkọ ti ile-iṣẹ rẹ ṣiṣẹ pẹlu ohun elo naa.
I picked up a little.	Mo ti gbe kekere kan.
They can be under other boxes.	Wọn le wa labẹ awọn apoti miiran.
Very good.	O dara gaan.
I felt great.	Mo ro ara mi nla.
I think it was great.	Mo ro pe o jẹ nla.
We will also get the little girl.	A yoo tun gba ọmọbirin kekere naa.
This is their life.	Eyi ni aye wọn.
Or maybe they just haven't agreed to it yet.	Tabi boya wọn o kan ti ko gba si o sibẹsibẹ.
Nothing can be left unchecked.	Ko si ohun ti a ko le fi silẹ.
I am myself, just so you know.	Emi ni ara mi, o kan ki o mọ.
Very well done.	Gan daradara ṣe.
There is also something under this thing.	Ohun ti o wa labẹ nkan yii tun wa.
All that matters is a strong child.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni ọmọ ti o ni agbara.
I don’t get one of that from you.	Emi ko gba ọkan ninu iyẹn lati ọdọ rẹ.
I mean, hope people die.	Mo tumọ si, nireti eniyan yoo ku.
The lights are all gone.	Awọn ina ti lọ gbogbo.
He did not have to tell her.	Ko ni lati sọ fun u.
This is your bad day.	Eyi jẹ ọjọ buburu rẹ.
And that makes some sense.	Ati awọn ti o mu diẹ ninu awọn ori.
Maybe a little too much.	Boya kekere kan ju.
Leave it there.	Fi silẹ nibẹ.
Maybe you missed it.	Boya o padanu rẹ.
The kind of work we want to do.	Iru iṣẹ ti a fẹ ṣe.
Everyone else went to see them and the group.	Gbogbo eniyan miiran lọ lati wo wọn ati ẹgbẹ naa.
And now you have.	Ati bayi o ni.
Baby.	Bayi  .
So it may be so.	Nitorina o le jẹ bẹ.
The baby is not dead.	Ọmọ kekere naa ko ti ku.
And the last thing the night before bed.	Ati igba kẹhin ohun ni alẹ ṣaaju ki ibusun.
Children in this area do not have food.	Awọn ọmọde ni agbegbe yii ko ni ounjẹ.
You read everything you can get your hands on.	O ka ohun gbogbo ti o le gba ọwọ rẹ lori.
Other groups have something to do with it, of course.	Awọn ẹgbẹ miiran ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ, dajudaju.
You want to do it in public.	O fẹ lati ṣe ni gbangba.
At least he was with me.	O kere ju o wa pẹlu mi.
There are opportunities for the mother too.	Awọn anfani wa fun iya paapaa.
We have already completed this.	A ti pari eyi tẹlẹ.
You see some, but know there may be more.	O rii diẹ ninu, ṣugbọn mọ pe diẹ sii le wa.
However people are not watching and they are not listening.	Sibẹsibẹ awọn eniyan ko n wo ati pe wọn ko gbọ.
I will not give you any money.	Nko fun yin ni owo kankan.
A moment here.	A akoko nibi.
Obviously this is my life.	O han gbangba pe eyi ni igbesi aye mi.
I have been doing this for years.	Mo ṣe bẹ fun awọn ọdun.
We left.	A fi silẹ.
I will do so if you want me to do so.	Emi yoo ṣe bẹ ti o ba fẹ ki n ṣe bẹ.
Some people do not believe the story.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ko gbagbọ itan naa.
Ask the student to move to the back of the room.	Beere lọwọ ọmọ ile-iwe lati gbe lọ si ẹhin yara naa.
It was the last thing he told her.	O jẹ ohun ti o kẹhin ti o sọ fun u.
Women consider men more truthful than men.	Awọn obinrin ka awọn ọkunrin ni otitọ ju awọn ọkunrin ka awọn obinrin lọ.
But that is not what you are asking for.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti o n beere nipa.
One of these women will take her place.	Ọkan ninu awọn obinrin wọnyi yoo gba ipo rẹ.
These hurt me.	Awọn wọnyi ni ipalara fun mi.
I told you about myself.	Mo ti so fun o nipa ti ara mi.
Hot paper is a holiday after a hard day.	Iwe ti o gbona jẹ isinmi lẹhin ọjọ lile kan.
On the phone, we talked.	Lori foonu, a sọrọ.
You did not listen to his advice.	O ko gbọ imọran rẹ.
They are hot.	Wọn ti gbona.
The game reveals quite an interesting fact.	Awọn ere han ohun awon o daju.
We see our people, good and bad days.	A ri awọn eniyan wa, awọn ọjọ ti o dara ati buburu.
He allowed me to make this possible.	O pa mi laaye lati jẹ ki eyi ṣee ṣe.
Bad things are happening everywhere you look.	Awọn nkan buburu n ṣẹlẹ nibi gbogbo ti o wo.
Don’t let it happen man.	Maṣe jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ eniyan.
But we do not have time.	Sugbon a ko ti akoko.
They are winning.	Won n gba.
But that doesn't mean much.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko tumọ si pupọ.
You know when.	O mọ nigbati.
Here is what they were told.	Eyi ni ohun ti a sọ fun wọn.
Remember, these places have been around for years.	Ranti, awọn aaye wọnyi ti wa ni ayika fun ọdun.
We just use any wood.	A kan lo eyikeyi igi.
Maybe what made that boy a reality.	Boya ohun ti o jẹ ki ọmọkunrin yẹn jẹ otitọ.
They bathed in the sun.	Wọn wẹ ninu oorun.
Think this is not true.	Ro pe eyi kii ṣe otitọ.
He had a job, and he was like that.	O ni iṣẹ kan, o si dabi rẹ.
We hurried out to the car and jumped into it.	A sare jade lọ si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ati fo sinu.
He did it because he was holding you.	O ṣe nitori pe o di ọ mu.
None of them appeared more than twice.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o han diẹ sii ju igba meji lọ.
I was a little upset when the music stopped.	Mo binu diẹ nigbati orin duro.
You don’t need them anymore.	O ko nilo wọn mọ.
I can write on that.	Mo le kọ lori iyẹn.
People do not like facts.	Awọn eniyan ko fẹran awọn otitọ.
So they can believe.	Nitorina wọn le gbagbọ.
Please help me to help them.	Jọwọ ran mi lọwọ lati ran wọn lọwọ.
They started about an hour earlier.	Wọn ti bẹrẹ ni bii wakati kan ṣaaju.
You can do anything with football.	O le ṣe ohunkohun pẹlu bọọlu.
This comes from the way you live yourself.	Eyi wa lati ọna ti o gbe ara rẹ.
It gives you strength.	O fun ọ ni agbara.
Children mean.	Awọn ọmọde tumọ si.
Here are the three most important ones if you ask me.	Eyi ni awọn pataki pataki mẹta ti o ba beere lọwọ mi.
Or it is.	Tabi o jẹ.
I went to help him.	Mo lọ ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
This is your family.	Eyi ni idile rẹ.
They want men.	Awọn ọkunrin ni wọn fẹ.
That's two.	Iyẹn ṣe meji.
I'm convinced	Mo ni idaniloju si
This raises two possibilities.	Eleyi ji meji ti o ṣeeṣe.
No one used this train anymore.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o lo ọkọ oju irin yii mọ.
Much better than he would have thought.	Pupọ dara julọ ju oun yoo ti ronu lọ.
This is not my city.	Eyi kii ṣe ilu mi.
One of your legs is asleep.	Ọkan ninu ẹsẹ rẹ ti sun.
I do not know when it is.	Emi ko mọ nigba ti o jẹ.
I hope you like it !.	Mo nireti pe o fẹran rẹ!.
It makes sense, of course.	O ṣe oye, dajudaju.
Make sure there is room to stay.	Rii daju pe aaye wa lati duro.
This is not expected either.	Eyi ko nireti boya.
Let's get started.	Jẹ ká bẹrẹ.
He walked towards her.	O rin si ọdọ rẹ.
I picked one up.	Mo ti gbe ọkan soke.
He doesn’t know how to do it all the time.	Ko mọ lati ṣe ni gbogbo igba.
I know him, he lives just a few houses away.	Mo ti mọ rẹ, o ngbe ni o kan diẹ ile kuro.
Just stay there.	O kan duro nibẹ.
I think most of us would like that, too.	Mo ro pe pupọ julọ wa yoo fẹ iyẹn, paapaa.
He didn't seem to hear me.	O dabi ẹni pe ko gbọ mi.
It can or cannot be.	Ko le tabi kii ṣe.
Some books we bought ourselves.	Diẹ ninu awọn iwe ti a ra ara wa.
I don't want to cut it.	Nko fe ge e.
I did not do any of these things.	Emi ko ṣe ọkan ninu nkan wọnyi.
Police entered the building.	Ọlọpa wọ inu ile naa.
Go is a mature woman.	Lọ jẹ obinrin ti o dagba.
You have good reason to be afraid.	O ni idi ti o dara lati bẹru.
We say it again.	A sọ lẹẹkansi.
If only more like it.	Ti o ba jẹ pe diẹ sii bi rẹ.
Youth groups became a major problem.	Awọn ẹgbẹ ọdọ di iṣoro pataki kan.
Who is he.	Tani o jẹ.
They never lost a game at home.	Wọn ko padanu ere ni ile.
Ask for a room in the back.	Beere fun yara kan ni ẹhin.
It was a long time before he spoke.	O ti pẹ diẹ ṣaaju ki o to sọrọ.
He wrote little books.	O kọ awọn iwe kekere.
My brother promised me that he would not tell them.	Arakunrin mi ṣe ileri fun mi pe oun ko ni sọ fun wọn.
You used to have your own school at one time.	O lo lati ni ile-iwe tirẹ ni akoko kan.
Again and again and again.	Lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
We do not know.	A ko mọ ọ.
Believe me.	Gba mi gbọ.
Something went wrong.	Nkankan jẹ aṣiṣe.
That may not be good for your heart.	Iyẹn ko le dara fun ọkan rẹ.
Shouldn’t we start early tomorrow on the trip?	Ṣe ko yẹ ki a bẹrẹ ni kutukutu ni ọla lori irin-ajo naa?
You can find yourself talking to yourself.	O le ri ara rẹ sọrọ si ara rẹ.
Anyone can write and say anything about me.	Ẹnikẹni le kọ ati sọ ohunkohun nipa mi.
Just about everyone knows someone who loves to cook.	O kan nipa gbogbo eniyan mọ ẹnikan ti o nifẹ lati ṣe ounjẹ.
A man can.	Ọkunrin kan le.
But it was good at night.	Sugbon o dara ni alẹ.
He spent hours sitting on the beach.	O si lo wakati joko lori eti okun.
That is about me.	Iyẹn jẹ nipa mi.
The company is located in this city.	Ile-iṣẹ naa wa ni ilu yii.
I'm just saying what it is.	Mo n kan sọ kini o jẹ.
I will die forever.	Emi yoo ku lailai.
He didn't think I was doing it.	Ko lero pe emi ni o ṣe nkan yẹn.
We can do it yourself.	A le ṣe funrararẹ.
Just sit there.	O kan joko nibẹ.
It welcomes members of our community.	O gba awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti agbegbe wa.
Not so surprising.	Kii ṣe iyalẹnu pupọ.
You can read their one.	O le ka ọkan wọn.
Where everyone is.	Ibi ti gbogbo eniyan ni.
I think you understand.	Mo ro pe o loye.
I did not finish.	Nko pari.
Just as it is for man.	O kan bi o ṣe jẹ fun eniyan.
You need to find out more.	O nilo lati wa diẹ sii.
That is not the way to go.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ọna ti o maa n lọ.
For a long time, even.	Fun igba pipẹ, paapaa.
Of course I really enjoyed that meal.	Dajudaju Mo gbadun ounjẹ yẹn pupọ.
I do not want to be here.	Emi ko fẹ lati wa nibi.
Pretty much everyone.	Lẹwa Elo gbogbo eniyan.
I'm glad we got that and it 's good for you.	Inu mi dun pe a kọja iyẹn ati pe o dara julọ fun rẹ.
This is our opportunity.	Eyi ni anfani wa.
While they are sleeping.	Nigba ti won n sun.
Please stay here.	Jọwọ lati duro nibi.
It is your job now.	O jẹ iṣẹ rẹ ni bayi.
But they are also very wrong.	Ṣugbọn wọn tun jẹ aṣiṣe pupọ.
That will have to go.	Iyẹn yoo ni lati lọ.
If they change their diet, they often change their lifestyle.	Ti wọn ba yi ounjẹ wọn pada, ọpọlọpọ igba wọn yi igbesi aye wọn pada.
In some cases this is very true.	Ni awọn igba miiran eyi jẹ otitọ pupọ.
They also live in the area.	Wọn tun ngbe ni agbegbe.
These devices are difficult to operate.	Awọn ẹrọ wọnyi nira lati ṣiṣẹ.
To get it.	Lati gba o.
It is another opportunity to grow in a short time.	O jẹ anfani miiran lati dagba ni igba diẹ.
They want to get married.	Wọn fẹ lati ṣe igbeyawo.
I am with my sister.	Mo wa pẹlu arabinrin mi.
We haven't seen the sun for a month.	A ko tii ri oorun fun oṣu kan.
At this point my body is dead.	Ni aaye yii ara mi ti ku.
And we will get that thing from you.	Ati pe a yoo gba nkan yẹn lọwọ rẹ.
I would make sure to do so.	Emi yoo rii daju lati ṣe bẹ.
I want to see you again.	Mo tun fẹ lati wo ọ lẹẹkansi.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	O kan ni lati ni anfani pupọ julọ ninu ohun ti o ra.
You go enjoy yourself.	O lọ gbadun ara rẹ.
We need to try something like this.	A nilo lati gbiyanju nkan bi eyi.
Give the dog a bath.	Fun aja ni wẹ.
You have to keep it together.	O ni lati tọju rẹ papọ.
And that is what it is all about.	Ati awọn ti o jẹ ohun ti o ni gbogbo nipa.
Cats are a game when they wake up.	Awọn ọmọ ologbo jẹ ere nigbati wọn ba ji.
Come back and ask for more.	Pada ki o beere fun diẹ sii.
That is possible, and it is a matter of concern to me.	Iyẹn ṣee ṣe, ati pe o jẹ ọrọ kan ti o kan mi.
They only take one day off a week.	Wọn gba isinmi ọjọ kan nikan ni ọsẹ kan.
It is important to hear from anyone who may not be present at this meeting.	O ṣe pataki lati gbọ lati ọdọ ẹnikẹni ti ko le wa ni ipade yii.
It does nothing.	Ko se nkankan.
The first questions to them.	Awọn ibeere akọkọ si wọn.
And we hear a lot of this from men.	Ati pe a gbọ ọpọlọpọ eyi lati ọdọ awọn ọkunrin.
I think you can understand both.	Mo ro pe o le loye mejeeji.
That's not the point.	Kii ṣe eyi ti o fa si.
As you grow older, it becomes harder to do.	Bi o ṣe n dagba, o nira lati ṣe.
Missed jobs.	Ti padanu awọn iṣẹ.
The report has no questions.	Iroyin naa ko ni ibeere.
I do not understand what you are talking about.	Emi ko ni oye ohun ti o n sọrọ nipa.
But it’s not that simple.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe pe o rọrun.
You are not sure.	O ko da ara rẹ loju.
I thought pretty much alone.	Mo ro lẹwa Elo nikan.
We will never have a way of knowing who he is.	A kii yoo ni ọna lati mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
I can't wait for everyone to hear.	Emi ko le duro fun gbogbo eniyan lati gbọ.
I looked up.	Mo wo e soke.
I want to be beautiful.	Mo fẹ lati jẹ lẹwa.
We will have our tea shortly.	A yoo jẹ tii wa ni igba diẹ.
We do not have to.	A ko ni lati ni.
It has been a work of love.	O ti jẹ iṣẹ ifẹ.
We have to change our names.	A ni lati yi awọn orukọ wa pada.
There is also a mother.	Iya tun wa.
There are three possible ways to solve this problem.	Awọn ọna ti o ṣeeṣe mẹta wa si iṣoro yii.
My own children.	Awọn ọmọ ti ara mi.
So some time to do.	Nitorina akoko diẹ lati ṣe.
They did not go.	Wọn ko lọ.
I remember you were here.	Mo ranti pe o wa nibi.
It always seems to be fast.	Nigbagbogbo o dabi ẹni pe o yara.
Your type always does.	Iru rẹ nigbagbogbo ṣe.
And it's not over.	Ati ki o ko pari.
He stopped again, rolling his eyes.	O tun duro, o yi oju rẹ soke.
Your life itself.	Igbesi aye rẹ funrararẹ.
That’s pretty much what it has been.	Iyẹn lẹwa Elo ohun ti o ti jẹ.
What you have done is wrong.	Ohun ti o ti ṣe ko tọ.
The time of year does not hurt either.	Akoko ti odun ko ipalara boya.
He let it.	O jẹ ki o.
I try to write something like this.	Mo gbiyanju lati kọ nkan bi eyi.
Now you can only tell me.	Bayi o nikan le so fun mi.
I was everything, he said.	Mo jẹ ohun gbogbo, o sọ.
In ways that other people will not understand.	Ni awọn ọna ti awọn eniyan miiran kii yoo loye.
Without life, however, it does not.	Laisi aye, sibẹsibẹ, ko ṣe.
Prices are too high.	Awọn iye owo ti ga ju.
How good it is to be.	Bawo ni o dara ti o lati wa.
It is important what the reason is.	O ṣe pataki kini idi naa.
It is, to me.	O jẹ, si mi.
Any questions you have, just ask.	Eyikeyi ibeere ti o ni, kan beere.
Get a new driver.	Gba awakọ tuntun kan.
More than anything else, because it is impossible.	Diẹ sii ju ohunkohun miiran lọ, nitori ko ṣee ṣe.
We are best friends.	A jẹ ọrẹ to dara julọ.
This is not a bad thing.	Eyi kii ṣe ohun buburu.

You can come and go for two years.	O le wa ati lọ fun ọdun meji.
But we believe this is a good thing.	Ṣugbọn a gbagbọ pe eyi jẹ ohun ti o dara.
No image was visible to the public.	Ko si aworan kan ti o wa han si oju eniyan.
She tried to get up, but could not.	O gbiyanju lati dide, ṣugbọn ko le.
Please wait, you say to yourself.	Jọwọ duro, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
So we continue to pass one around.	Nitorina a tẹsiwaju lati kọja ọkan ni ayika.

For the most part, there are many to give up.	Fun pupọ julọ, ọpọlọpọ wa lati fi silẹ.

Surely you have feared for your life.	Daju pe o ti bẹru fun igbesi aye rẹ.

Okay, this is what happened.	O dara, eyi ni ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.

And even for some, this anxiety does not go away.	Ati paapaa fun diẹ ninu awọn, aniyan yii ko lọ kuro.
I took it in my head.	Mo mu u ni ori.
He was always in trouble at school.	Nigbagbogbo o wa ninu wahala ni ile-iwe.
Try not to take it too seriously.	Gbiyanju lati ma ṣe mu ni pataki ju.
I do not plan to drink today.	Emi ko gbero lati mu loni.
But we have no chance.	Sugbon a ko ni anfani.
Give it a try.	Fun o kan gbiyanju.
Don't waste too much time!	Maṣe padanu akoko pupọ!
In a way, we are all stronger.	Ni ọna kan, gbogbo wa jẹ okun.
Okay, you think about me, great.	O dara, o ro nipa mi, nla.

He decided to contact the police.	O pinnu lati kan ọlọpa.
In fact, both can be at work.	Ni otitọ, awọn mejeeji le wa ni iṣẹ.

There are small children.	Awọn ọmọ kekere wa.
One sits, one stands.	Ọkan joko, ọkan duro.

Ever since you saw that your child is telling the truth.	Lati igba ti o ti rii pe ọmọ rẹ ti n sọ otitọ.

They are the same people as us.	Wọn jẹ eniyan kanna bi wa.
It is almost sun behind you now.	O fẹrẹ ni oorun lẹhin rẹ ni bayi.

In other words, be on top of your game.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, wa lori oke ere rẹ.
At this point, there is a significant advantage.	Ni akoko yii, anfani pataki wa.
But, very fond of talking.	Ṣugbọn, nifẹ pupọ lati sọrọ.
But there is more to come.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii tun wa lati wa.
He did not want to be.	Ko fe lati wa ni.
Not only for my lost friends, but for myself.	Kii ṣe fun awọn ọrẹ mi ti o padanu nikan, ṣugbọn fun ara mi.
All he said was that he would find me.	Gbogbo ohun ti o sọ ni pe oun yoo wa mi.
Keep it.	Pa a mọ.
This method is in good condition.	Ọna yii wa ni ipo ti o dara.
We have become one more than two.	A ti di ọkan ju meji lọ.
I found out he was dead and it was too late.	Mo rii pe o ti ku ati pe o ti pẹ to bẹ.
They will not give him what he asks for.	Wọn kii yoo fun u ni ohun ti o beere fun.
The journey takes several days or weeks.	Irin-ajo naa gba ọpọlọpọ awọn ọjọ tabi awọn ọsẹ.
Just accept that it exists.	O kan gba pe o wa.
He is nothing to me anymore.	Oun ko jẹ nkankan fun mi mọ.

We got up and walked together down the road.	A dide ati rin papọ ni isalẹ ọna naa.
Fun and games.	Fun ati awọn ere.
From home.	Lati ile.
There is no question of that.	Ko si ibeere ti iyẹn.
Much to learn, little time.	Pupọ lati kọ ẹkọ, akoko diẹ.
But two things seem clear.	Sugbon meji ohun dabi ko o.
So you should.	Nitorina o yẹ ki o.
We have to say what we do not want.	A ni lati sọ ohun ti a ko fẹ.
And many others less.	Ati ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran kere.
I don’t think they made a mistake.	Emi ko ro pe wọn ṣe aṣiṣe.
I can't say no.	Emi ko le sọ rara.
They like the idea.	Wọn fẹran imọran naa.
And he gave them.	O si fi fun wọn.
Everyone is looking to be empowered, including you.	Gbogbo eniyan n wa lati ni agbara, pẹlu iwọ.
I can’t take advantage of it like this.	Emi ko le lo anfani rẹ bi eleyi.
For most people.	Fun ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
There is no one in the house better.	Ko si ẹnikan ninu ile ti o dara.
No, I'm sorry brother.	Rara, ma binu arakunrin.
Stand up for yourself.	Duro fun ara rẹ.
Just a few ways.	O kan awọn ọna diẹ.
You do not have to do this.	O ko ni lati ṣe eyi.
After dinner, the lights went out.	Lẹhin ounjẹ alẹ, awọn ina ti jade.
I just keep my head down and walk and walk.	Mo kan pa ori mi mọ ati rin ati rin.
Listen, friend, you have to help me.	Gbọ, ọrẹ, o ni lati ran mi lọwọ.
It was time for the two men to move on.	O to akoko fun awọn ọkunrin meji lati tẹsiwaju.
When we do the thing.	Nigba ti a ba ṣe nkan naa.
I am a human being.	Eniyan ni mi.
And he was afraid of them.	O si bẹru wọn.
It's completely gone.	O ti lọ patapata.
The head was strong.	Awọn ori wà agbara.
Everyone agrees to talk.	Gbogbo eniyan gba lati sọrọ.
I do not want.	Emi ko fẹ.
We must make a decision.	A gbọdọ ṣe ipinnu.
I must see you.	Mo gbọdọ ri ọ.
It helps me to think.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi lati ronu.
There are a few seats.	Awọn ijoko diẹ wa.
I think that would be a problem.	Mo ro pe iyẹn yoo jẹ iṣoro kan.
Maybe they will forget about it.	Boya wọn yoo gbagbe nipa rẹ.
They get love.	Won gba ife.
He caught himself.	O mu ara rẹ.
His mother would go through him.	Iya rẹ yoo lọ nipasẹ rẹ.
He left.	Ko kuro.
It is worth it for such a special purpose.	O tọ si fun iru idi pataki kan.
Read on to understand.	Ka lati ni oye.
But we should not be quick to think.	Ṣugbọn a ko yẹ ki o yara lati ro.
Okay that way.	Dara ni ọna yẹn.
There are books about that.	Awọn iwe wa nipa iyẹn.
How happy she was to see her family torn apart.	Bawo ni o ṣe dun pupọ lati ri idile rẹ ti a ya.
We don’t take care of ourselves, that’s the problem.	A ko tọju ara wa, iṣoro naa ni.
Maybe even before.	Boya paapaa ṣaaju.
There is little that can not be done.	Nibẹ ni kekere ti ko le ṣe.
I was very, very wrong.	Mo jẹ aṣiṣe pupọ, pupọ.
Everyone loves it !.	Gbogbo eniyan nifẹ rẹ!.
We are very good.	Pupọ wa dara gaan.
It's stronger, he said.	Okun ni, o sọ.
I do not expect to be here in the morning.	Emi ko nireti lati wa nibi ni owurọ.
Do not be afraid.	Maṣe bẹru.
You should treat your mother with love and respect.	O yẹ ki o tọju iya rẹ pẹlu ifẹ ati ọwọ.
I can not go to you.	Emi ko le lọ si ọdọ rẹ.
Do you have any money left over?	Ṣe o ni owo kankan ti o ku?
It’s great to see these people.	O jẹ nla lati wo awọn eniyan wọnyi.
We must always ask.	A gbọdọ beere nigbagbogbo.
I will kill him.	Emi yoo pa a.
It's time to dump her and move on.	O to akoko lati yipada.
They talked for a few minutes, before the phone rang.	Wọn sọrọ fun iṣẹju diẹ, ṣaaju ki foonu naa ti kọja si mi.
I will kill him.	Emi yoo pa a.
It's my whole family.	Gbogbo idile mi ni.
Some tasks can only be done manually.	Diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ le ṣee ṣe pẹlu ọwọ nikan.
We'll just have to wait and see.	A yoo kan ni lati duro ati rii.
She talks about her children.	O sọrọ nipa awọn ọmọ rẹ.
O fe e, o mu u.	O fe e, o mu u.
The sister stopped, she was scared.	Arabinrin naa duro, o bẹru.
I do not read anything.	Nko ka nkankan.
Find out where our school is.	Wa ibi ti ile-iwe wa.
He said he would take me some time.	O sọ pe oun yoo gba mi ni akoko diẹ.
No bottom.	Ko si isalẹ.
No wonder no one likes it.	Ko ṣe iyanu pe ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹran rẹ.
And that is just that.	Ati pe eyi jẹ iyẹn nikan.
Find out what happened and where.	Wa ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ati ibi ti o wa.
Some people are afraid to walk alone at night.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan bẹru lati rin nikan ni alẹ.
This is very easy to do.	Eyi rọrun pupọ lati ṣe.
I hit down.	Mo ti lu isalẹ.
It would have stayed there for months on end before anyone noticed.	Yoo ti duro nibẹ fun awọn oṣu ni ipari ṣaaju ki ẹnikẹni ṣe akiyesi.
He got up and left the room.	O dide o si jade kuro ninu yara naa.
I am not.	Emi ko jẹ bẹni.
People carry things.	Eniyan gbe ohun.
Tomorrow, it is yours.	Ọla, o jẹ tirẹ.
One can say it is over.	Eniyan le so pe o ti pari.
I want to kill someone.	Mo fe lati pa ẹnikan.
Our members will do this.	Awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ wa yoo ṣe eyi.
Maybe not.	Boya kii ṣe bẹ.

When winter comes, the rain will end.	Nigbati igba otutu ba de, ojo yoo pari.
Everyone was beaten.	Gbogbo eniyan ni a lu.
I did not laugh with him.	Emi ko rẹrin pẹlu rẹ.
Man has to do that for himself.	Eniyan ni lati ṣe iyẹn fun ara rẹ.
Everything is wrong.	Ohun gbogbo ni aṣiṣe.
Don’t let the details go.	Ma ṣe jẹ ki awọn alaye lọ.
He kissed the baby's forehead.	O fi ẹnu ko iwaju ọmọ naa.
That’s pretty much it.	Iyẹn lẹwa Elo o.
Here it means something obvious.	Nibi o tumọ si nkan ti o han.
Take some time for yourself.	Gba akoko diẹ fun ara rẹ.
I think it was amazing.	Mo ro pe o jẹ iyanu.
I left his hand.	Mo fi ọwọ rẹ silẹ.
Others say it's just there all the time.	Awọn miiran sọ pe o kan wa nibẹ ni gbogbo igba.
They're out.	Wọn n jade.
She is her husband.	Oun ni ọkọ rẹ.
She nodded her head in surprise.	O fi ori pa ara rẹ ni iyalẹnu.
You can not do that.	O ko le ṣe bẹ.
The translation has been removed.	A ti yọ tumọ naa kuro patapata.
Don't rush through it.	Maṣe yara nipasẹ rẹ.
You have your reasons.	O ni awọn idi rẹ.
I am not sure about everything.	Emi ko ni idaniloju nipa ohun gbogbo.
Spend your time on your favorite techniques.	Lo akoko rẹ lori awọn ọgbọn rẹ ti o gbadun julọ.
This is a real question.	Eyi jẹ ibeere ti o daju.
We do a lot.	A ṣe pupọ.
If you are here, you can not see it.	Ti o ba wa nibi, o ko le ri i.
To take advantage of this, you must hurry.	Lati lo anfani yii, o gbọdọ yara.
Our job is to kill.	Ise wa ni lati pa.
They talk about it in the game.	Wọn sọrọ nipa rẹ ninu ere.
If they catch you, you will not enjoy it.	Ti wọn ba mu ọ, iwọ kii yoo gbadun rẹ.
He does not want us.	Ko fe wa.
I have a good understanding of it.	Mo ni oye to dara lori rẹ.
Need to exit.	Nilo lati jade.
We thought that maybe that was just his style.	A ro wipe boya ti o je o kan rẹ ara.
Raise your hand.	Gbe ọwọ rẹ soke.
Even when you have the best.	Paapaa nigbati o ba ni ohun ti o dara julọ.
I grew up in a working class area.	Mo ti dagba soke ni a ṣiṣẹ kilasi agbegbe.
They are angry.	Wọn binu.

It was the boy.	Ọmọkunrin naa ni.
You can eat.	O le jẹun.
I have been doing this for two years.	Mo ti ṣe bẹ fun ọdun meji.
The house has three rooms.	Ile naa ni awọn yara mẹta.
No one even wore a suit.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wọ aṣọ kan paapaa.
I can't find them.	Emi ko le ri wọn.
You probably get your job because you are beautiful.	O ṣee ṣe pe o gba iṣẹ rẹ nitori pe o lẹwa.
I'm glad it's coming.	Inu mi dun pe o nbọ.
Not that you know it in those terms.	Kii ṣe pe o mọ ọ ni awọn ofin yẹn.
But they can be better.	Ṣugbọn wọn le dara julọ.
This is true today more than ever.	Eyi jẹ otitọ loni ju lailai.
He loves it.	O nifẹ rẹ.
Their meeting ended well.	Ipade wọn pari daradara.
Join us today !.	Wa da wa loni!.
You can draw on me for any significant amount.	O le fa lori mi fun eyikeyi iye pataki.
You can have it, but it doesn't.	O le ni, ṣugbọn ko ṣe.
Where you get our newspapers on the train.	Ibi ti o ti gba awọn iwe iroyin wa lori ọkọ oju irin.
People are going to and from where.	Awọn eniyan n lọ si ati lati ibi ti o wa.
She has become his parent.	O ti di obi rẹ.
There are three people on the field right now.	Eniyan mẹta wa lori ibudo aaye ni bayi.
It’s easier said than done, you might say.	O rọrun lati sọ ju ṣiṣe lọ, o le sọ.
You must find great power in it.	O gbọdọ rii agbara nla ninu rẹ.
This left well.	Eyi fi silẹ daradara.
We'd better go to the bottom of this.	A dara julọ lati lọ si isalẹ ti eyi.
Again the same question remains.	Lẹẹkansi ibeere kanna wa.
But no.	Ṣugbọn ko si.
You have to love to travel.	O ni lati nifẹ lati rin irin-ajo.
It is time to look at this problem.	O to akoko ti a wo iṣoro yii.
I see what it means.	Mo ri ohun ti o tumọ si.
But, he also thinks there is nothing after life.	Ṣugbọn, o tun ro pe ko si nkankan lẹhin igbesi aye.
I will not try to do what they do.	Emi kii yoo gbiyanju lati ṣe ohun ti wọn ṣe.
All the kids are there.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọde wa nibẹ.
We are already here.	A ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
Of course there is more to it than that.	Dajudaju o wa diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
We need to learn from this moment.	A nilo lati kọ ẹkọ lati akoko yii.
It does not mean it is not good enough.	Ko tumọ si pe o ko dara to.
The sister watched as she walked down the street.	Arabinrin naa wo bi o ti n rin ni opopona.
I will cause this.	Emi yoo fa eyi.
Maybe it won’t be as hard as they think.	Boya kii yoo jẹ lile bi wọn ṣe ro.
However, he cannot go back now.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko le pada sẹhin ni bayi.
I do not think he will tell me.	Emi ko ro pe oun yoo sọ fun mi.
He had finished it off and now he had a body.	O ti pari o si pa a ati ni bayi o ti ni ara kan.
He hurried away.	O yara lọ.
How can not.	Bi ko ṣe le ṣe.
Now it is too late.	Bayi o ti pẹ ju.
Soon it was easy to see why.	Laipẹ o rọrun lati rii idi.
I almost left.	Mo ti fẹrẹ fi silẹ.
I know this for a fact.	Mo mọ eyi ni otitọ.
Did you have an accident?	Ṣe o ni ijamba kan?
He is still waiting.	O tun n duro de.
You know everything about him.	O mọ ohun gbogbo nipa rẹ.
No one knows how to get started.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ bi o ṣe le bẹrẹ.
Nothing becomes anything.	Ko si nkankan di nkankan.
I think you do.	Mo ro pe o ṣe.
He has stayed with us, so we stay with him.	O ti duro pẹlu wa, nitorina a duro pẹlu rẹ.
This is a legal agreement.	Eyi jẹ adehun ofin.
I agree to do so.	Mo gba lati ṣe bẹ.
He did not even try to keep it.	Bii ko paapaa gbiyanju lati tọju rẹ.
This applies to all classes.	Eyi kan si gbogbo awọn kilasi.
I just don't like the way they talk.	Mo kan ko fẹran ọna ti wọn sọrọ.
So, how long have you been married?	Nitorina, bawo ni o ti pẹ to ti ṣe igbeyawo?
This is a system that stands the test of time.	Eyi jẹ eto ti o duro idanwo ti akoko.
And these are the kind of people who are the best.	Ati pe awọn wọnyi ni iru eniyan ti o dara julọ.
But it happens this way.	Ṣugbọn o ṣẹlẹ ni ọna yii.
Well, maybe you will and maybe you won't.	Daradara, boya o yoo ati boya o yoo ko.
Please, let us try.	Jọwọ, jẹ ki a gbiyanju.
I know this because everyone tells everyone else how good it is.	Mo mọ eyi nitori gbogbo eniyan sọ fun gbogbo eniyan miiran bi o ṣe dara.
Much will not let you do it.	Pupọ kii yoo jẹ ki o ṣe.
She tried to think of something else.	O gbiyanju lati ronu nkan miiran.
To his mother.	Si iya rẹ.
In fact more than a few.	Ni otitọ diẹ sii ju diẹ lọ.
Make sure you are on that plane tomorrow.	Rii daju pe o wa lori ọkọ ofurufu yẹn ni ọla.
They are for good reason.	Wọn jẹ idi ti o tọ.
He was telling everyone that he was dead.	O ti n sọ fun gbogbo eniyan pe o ti ku.
An airplane up.	Ọkọ ofurufu kan soke.
It's a killer thing.	O jẹ ohun ti o pa.
If you expect anything else, you do not know it well.	Ti o ba nireti ohunkohun miiran, iwọ ko mọ ọ daradara.
That’s a lot of understanding about it.	Iyẹn jẹ oye pupọ nipa rẹ.
I don't think much about it.	Emi ko ronu pupọ nipa rẹ.
I walked away forced to explain myself.	Mo ti rin kuro fi agbara mu lati se alaye ara mi.
I just want to meet you.	Mo kan fẹ lati pade rẹ.
They know me well and they have taken care of me.	Wọn mọ daradara ati pe wọn ti tọju mi.
Who knows where he was the day before.	Tani o mọ ibi ti o wa ni ọjọ ṣaaju.
No money, he said.	Ko si owo, o sọ.
They ask for food for the children.	Wọn beere ounjẹ fun awọn ọmọde.
Before the time comes out.	Ṣaaju ki akoko to jade.
The game did not stop.	Ere naa ko duro.
This happened last week.	Eyi ṣẹlẹ ni ọsẹ to kọja.
But he was anxious.	Ṣugbọn o ni aniyan.
It gives us a class.	O fun wa ni kilasi.
Friends are coming.	Awọn ọrẹ n bọ.
It is not what they are known for.	Kii ṣe ohun ti wọn mọ fun.
They took good care of me.	Wọn tọju mi ​​daradara.
Honestly, let me look at that.	Ni otitọ, jẹ ki n wo iyẹn.
There is plenty of room to grow.	Aaye pupọ wa lati dagba.
I know all of these.	Mo mọ gbogbo awọn wọnyi.
But it has never felt like enough.	Sugbon o ti ko ro bi to.
We want this baby in our lives.	A fẹ ọmọ yii ni igbesi aye wa.
Most people believe that boys are smarter than girls.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan gbagbọ pe awọn ọmọkunrin ni oye ju awọn ọmọbirin lọ.
There are not enough jobs.	Ko si awọn iṣẹ ti o to.
There it is.	O wa.
You just can’t do anything with it.	O kan ko le ṣe ohunkohun pẹlu rẹ.
Let's go outside for a minute.	Jẹ ki a jade ni ita fun iṣẹju kan.
Not required.	A ko beere.
His intelligence seems to have changed.	Ọgbọn rẹ dabi pe o ti yipada.
You do what you want to do.	O ṣe nkan ti o fẹ ṣe.
It will only be sun down here.	Yoo jẹ nikan ni oorun si isalẹ nibi.
I will sing a song for you.	Emi o kọ orin kan fun ọ.
Will be back to get more.	Yoo ṣee ṣe pada lati gba diẹ sii.
It will be hard.	Yoo jẹ lile.
A fact, not a feeling.	Otitọ kan, kii ṣe rilara.
He made a story on the site.	O ṣe itan kan lori aaye naa.
Please let me drink some water.	Jọwọ jẹ ki mi mu omi.
One of them is water.	Ọkan ninu wọn jẹ omi.
He could not speak for a minute.	Ko le sọrọ fun iṣẹju kan.
Please have a minute.	Jọwọ ni iṣẹju kan.
If you continue to drive, you will kill someone.	Ti o ba tẹsiwaju lati wakọ, iwọ yoo pa ẹnikan.
And they took money with him.	Awọn o si mu owo pẹlu rẹ.
I want that with you.	Mo fẹ iyẹn pẹlu rẹ.
Mothers make boys.	Awọn iya ṣe awọn ọmọkunrin.
You deserve to be young in gifts.	O yẹ lati wa ni odo ni awọn ẹbun.
Today is the last day we can get.	Loni ni ọjọ ikẹhin ti a le gba.
The baby sleeps in the crib.	Ọmọ naa sun ninu ibusun ibusun.
It worked well at first.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara ni akọkọ.
It should be the best time of your life.	O yẹ ki o jẹ akoko ti o dara julọ ti igbesi aye rẹ.
Not like his mother.	Ko bi iya rẹ ṣe.
It looks like this.	O dabi eleyi.
It’s a good thing to know.	O jẹ ohun ti o dara lati mọ.
Sometimes, we can go for months without rain.	Nigba miiran, a le lọ fun awọn oṣu laisi ojo.
The more the one becomes that there is a reason.	Awọn diẹ awọn ọkan di wipe o wa ni a idi.
I'm happy for that.	Inu mi dun fun iyẹn.

They will pass if you let them.	Wọn yoo kọja ti o ba jẹ ki wọn.
I wish you all the best.	Mo fẹ ki o ni ohun gbogbo ti o dara julọ.
And that would have meant a lot to him.	Ati pe yoo ti tumọ si ohun nla fun u.
When he was a child, he was afraid of dogs.	Nigbati o wa ni ọmọde, o bẹru awọn aja.
His mother told me about the celebration.	Iya rẹ sọ fun mi nipa ayẹyẹ naa.
And this promise is not just for us.	Ati pe ileri yii kii ṣe fun wa nikan.
We don't want to play that game.	A ko fẹ lati ṣe ere yẹn.
I should not leave.	Emi ko yẹ ki o lọ kuro.
So full of life.	Nitorina kun fun igbesi aye.
You can wait to lose what you have been working for.	O le duro lati padanu ohun ti o ti ṣiṣẹ fun.
He was also happy to hear his name.	O tun dun lati gbọ orukọ rẹ.
But no, it helps.	Ṣugbọn ko si, ṣe iranlọwọ.
Just to draw attention.	O kan lati fa akiyesi.
To some people.	Si awọn eniyan kan.
I'm looking for them.	Mo wa wọn.
Just let it be.	O kan jẹ ki o jẹ.
Just do that.	Kan lọ ṣe iyẹn.
Who should not die.	Tani ko yẹ ki o ku.
Give them to him.	Fi wọn fun u.
She thought of him as a girl.	O ro rẹ bi ọmọbirin kan.
Now go to your room.	Bayi lọ si yara rẹ.
Out to get you.	Jade lati gba ọ.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	Ma binu, ma binu.

Your future is uncertain.	Ọjọ iwaju rẹ ko ni idaniloju.
Someone wanted to know something.	Ẹnikan ti fẹ lati mọ nkankan.
Other people have done it in the past.	Awọn eniyan miiran ti ṣe ni igba atijọ.

And it feels very good.	Ati pe o ni imọran ti o dara pupọ.
We have no idea what they did.	A ko ni imọran ohun ti wọn ṣe.
The policeman is talking to someone.	Ọlọpa naa n ba ẹnikan sọrọ.
She is so beautiful in her holiday dress.	O lẹwa pupọ ninu aṣọ ayẹyẹ rẹ.
You are not here.	Iwọ ko wa.

That’s an amazing area to work in.	Iyẹn jẹ agbegbe iyalẹnu lati ṣiṣẹ ninu.

Look at all of you, boy.	Wo gbogbo yin, ọmọkunrin.
You will not die.	Iwọ kii yoo ku.
Tell him how you went.	Sọ fun u bi o ṣe lọ.

But that is a completely different story.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ itan miiran patapata.
I'm looking forward to this.	Mo n reti eyi pupọ.
And that’s not good.	Ati pe iyẹn ko dara.
It was a difficult time.	O jẹ akoko ti o nira.

I think other people said it best.	Mo ro pe miiran eniyan so wipe o dara ju.
You can let them say whatever you want to say.	O le jẹ ki wọn sọ ohunkohun ti o fẹ sọ.
Anyone would kill to be one of them.	Ẹnikẹni yoo pa lati jẹ ọkan ninu wọn.
You don’t just ask me to do something for you.	O ko kan beere fun mi lati ṣe nkan fun ọ.
He seems to know a lot about the girl.	O dabi ẹni pe o mọ pupọ nipa ọmọbirin naa.
He told us what he did for us.	O sọ ohun ti o ṣe fun wa.
Okay, you can read me out.	O dara, o le ka mi jade.
No one stood up to give him a seat.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o dide lati fun u ni ijoko.
He hopes such reports will come, but not so soon.	O nireti pe iru awọn iroyin yoo wa, ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ laipẹ.
Possibly that.	O ṣeeṣe yẹn.
It contains many books.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe.
Find something in your home.	Wa nkan ninu ile rẹ.
It is not your gift.	Kii ṣe ẹbun rẹ.
Give us your thoughts.	Fun wa ni ero rẹ.
The idea is wrong.	Ero naa ko tọ.
I enjoy this kind of weather.	Mo gbadun iru oju ojo yii.
Can't think of a better life.	Ko le ronu nipa igbesi aye ti o dara julọ.
He began to get up.	O bẹrẹ si dide.

Not as you thought it would be.	Ko le bi o ti ro pe yoo jẹ.
Tell me why you are here.	Sọ fun mi idi ti o fi wa nibi.
You know yourself well.	O mọ ara rẹ daradara.
They do not know that you are here.	Wọn ko mọ pe o wa nibi.
They would say, your father.	Wọn yoo sọ, baba rẹ.
I started to hate it.	Mo bẹrẹ si korira rẹ.
That can be very difficult for me.	Iyẹn le pupọ fun mi.
And listen to your garden.	Ati ki o gbọ ọgba rẹ.
Such may be, or may not be.	Iru le jẹ, tabi ko le jẹ.
We have to leave three of them already.	A ni lati fi mẹta ninu wọn silẹ tẹlẹ.
What is the minimum.	Kini o kere julọ.
It’s not that it matters to your type.	Kii ṣe pe o ṣe pataki si iru rẹ.
You teach yourself how to read music.	O kọ ara rẹ bi o ṣe le ka orin.
This game was burned.	A sun ere yi.
Everyone has their own idea of ​​how it should be done.	Gbogbo eniyan ni imọran wọn ti bii o ṣe yẹ ki o ṣe.
I am not very good.	Emi ko dara pupọ.
But he continued to walk.	Ṣugbọn o tẹsiwaju lati rin.
But it was a lost cause.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ idi ti o padanu.
But only for a while.	Sugbon nikan fun akoko.
I don’t think much of your friends.	Emi ko ro Elo ti awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
The other day life seems a little different.	Awọn ọjọ miiran igbesi aye dabi diẹ diẹ.
There is such a thing as a team member getting older.	Iru nkan kan wa bi ẹgbẹ ẹgbẹ kan ti dagba ju.

You want it done.	O fẹ pe o ṣe.
You have good days and bad days.	O ni awọn ọjọ ti o dara ati awọn ọjọ buburu.
I am worried about myself.	Mo ni aniyan nipa ara mi.
That is our intention to come out.	Iyẹn ni ero wa lati jade.
Your problem is to get someone to accept.	Iṣoro rẹ ni lati gba ẹnikan lati gba.
Until a point.	Titi di aaye kan.
She bought some of her clothes there.	O ra diẹ ninu awọn aṣọ rẹ nibẹ.
Everything is fine.	Ohun gbogbo ti dara.
Children are the future of anything.	Awọn ọmọde jẹ ojo iwaju ti ohunkohun.
Money was nothing.	Owo je ko si ohun.
You will say you have, but they will laugh.	Iwọ yoo sọ pe iwọ ni, ṣugbọn wọn yoo rẹrin.
There are only two ways to cut a tree.	Awọn ọna meji nikan lo wa lati ge igi kan.
Not everyone is happy.	Ko gbogbo eniyan dun.
Or a history book.	Tabi iwe itan.
For these men have come to help us.	Fun awọn ọkunrin wọnyi ti wa lati ran wa.
So it changed in a way.	Nitorina o yipada ni ọna kan.
If you are here to kill me, it is a deal complete.	Ti o ba wa nibi lati pa mi, o jẹ adehun ti pari.
I do not want to be married.	Emi ko fẹ lati wa ni iyawo.
You can not make yourself finish the meal.	O ko le ṣe ara rẹ pari ounjẹ naa.
There are few details of the accident at this time.	Awọn alaye diẹ wa ti ijamba ti o wa ni akoko yii.
They were only planning it when they were arrested.	Wọn ti n gbero rẹ nikan nigbati wọn mu wọn.
Look at that cat!	Wo ologbo yẹn!

You can not say anything.	O ko le sọ ohunkohun.
Now bring your friend to one again.	Bayi mu ọrẹ rẹ si ọkan lẹẹkansi.
Make sure you do not take yourself into this situation.	Rii daju pe ki o ma gba ara rẹ si ipo yii.
He also held her hand.	O tun di ọwọ rẹ mu.
Mo pa a.	Mo pa a.
He stopped there and stayed there.	O duro nibẹ o si duro nibẹ.
There are a few major roads in this area.	Awọn opopona pataki diẹ wa ni agbegbe yii.
I don't think we are there yet.	Emi ko ro pe a wa nibẹ sibẹsibẹ.
And we did that.	Ati pe a ṣe iyẹn.
An idea came to him.	Ero kan wa si ọdọ rẹ.
Try it some time.	Gbiyanju o diẹ ninu awọn akoko.
Nothing can change it.	Ko si ohun ti o le yi i pada.
We will go driving, for no reason.	A yoo lọ awakọ, laisi idi.
You know how they are.	O mọ bi wọn ṣe jẹ.
And for other reasons, too.	Ati fun awọn idi miiran, paapaa.
But the kids are there.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọmọde wa nibẹ.
The student lives with his mother.	Ọmọ ile-iwe n gbe pẹlu iya rẹ.
I heard it, too.	Mo ti gbọ rẹ, ju.
Before it's too late.	Ṣaaju ki o to pẹ ju.
Tell him to expect one.	Sọ fun u lati reti ọkan.
It comes from less than anything.	O wa lati kere ju ohunkohun.
But pretty good.	Ṣugbọn lẹwa dara julọ.
Her parents gave her a lot of time.	Awọn obi rẹ fi akoko pupọ fun u.
No one can bring it out.	Ko si ẹniti o le gbe e jade.
Which they do not like.	Eyi ti wọn ko fẹ.
The heat is intense.	Ooru naa le.
See if you can tell which one it is.	Wo boya o le sọ eyi ti o jẹ.
I don’t know what could happen to me yet.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o le ṣẹlẹ si mi sibẹsibẹ.
They were always very fast for me.	Nigbagbogbo wọn yara pupọ fun mi.
Nice, simple, long life.	Dara julọ, rọrun, igbesi aye to gun.
Just something else.	O kan ohun miiran.
And it was also very sweet for me.	Ati pe o tun dun pupọ fun mi.
That makes a good sense.	Iyẹn ṣe oye to dara.
To be with him.	Lati wa pẹlu rẹ.
But this does not mean that they can no longer cause trouble.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko tumọ si pe wọn ko tun le fa wahala.
Try to lock this door hard.	Gbiyanju lati ti ilẹkun yi lile.
It’s a piece of water.	O jẹ nkan ti omi.
Don't doubt it at all.	Maṣe ṣiyemeji rẹ rara.
It is, it is.	O jẹ, o jẹ.
This week there will be many questions.	Ni ọsẹ yii ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere yoo wa.
He wrote it down.	O kọ o si isalẹ.
It looks good.	O dabi ẹni pe o dara.
He reached the front of the car.	O de iwaju ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
There is no question about that.	Ko si ibeere nipa iyẹn.
They will want others to do it for them.	Wọn yoo fẹ ki awọn miiran ṣe fun wọn.
None of them have seen such a thing before.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o ti rii iru bẹ tẹlẹ.
I try to laugh with them.	Mo gbiyanju lati rẹrin pẹlu wọn.
Whatever happens, will happen.	Ohunkohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ, yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Maybe if the woman is younger.	Boya ti obinrin naa ba kere si.
It’s the kind of world they’ve grown up with.	O jẹ iru aye ti wọn ti dagba.
That would make me lose, especially.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ ki emi padanu, paapaa.
And he did the same.	O si ṣe kanna.
They have a new system to learn.	Wọn ni eto tuntun lati kọ ẹkọ.
But what is written is what stands.	Ṣugbọn ohun ti a kọ silẹ ni ohun ti o duro.
He worked hard in his youth.	O ṣiṣẹ pupọ ni awọn ọjọ ọdọ rẹ.
He has no place for anything else.	Ko ni aye fun ohunkohun miiran.
We need new ones.	A nilo awọn tuntun.
She hopes to have a baby this month.	O nireti lati bi ọmọ ni oṣu yii.
I was pretty good.	Mo ti wà lẹwa ti o dara.
We all have a lot to learn.	Gbogbo wa ni ọpọlọpọ lati kọ ẹkọ.

I have seen the thing.	Mo ti ri nkan naa.
And it doesn’t matter what you do.	Ati pe ko ṣe pataki ohun ti o ṣe.
Children should wash their hands before meals.	Awọn ọmọde yẹ ki o wẹ ọwọ wọn ṣaaju ounjẹ.
They were shown out.	Won ni won han jade.
I watched them.	Mo ti wo wọn.
It has been done all the time.	O ti ṣe ni gbogbo igba.
It really does.	O ṣe gaan.
The fact is that it is a job.	Otitọ ni pe o jẹ iṣẹ kan.
That is a fact.	Otitọ niyẹn.
Let's not say another word about it.	Jẹ ki a ma sọ ​​ọrọ miiran nipa rẹ.
The cat jumped out of the tree.	Ologbo naa fo kuro ni igi yẹn.
He thought he was not paying enough attention.	O ro pe ko fun akiyesi to pe.
He took her to the first room.	O mu u lọ si yara akọkọ.
What you are saying cannot be true.	Ohun ti o n sọ ko le jẹ otitọ.
No feeling.	Ko si rilara.
Everyone is talking about that new restaurant.	Gbogbo eniyan n sọrọ nipa ile ounjẹ tuntun yẹn.
He still moved.	O si tun gbe.
He spent hours in the store.	O lo awọn wakati ni ile itaja.
Rules should be passed so that this does not happen again.	Awọn ofin yẹ ki o kọja ki eyi ko ṣẹlẹ mọ.
You don’t have to worry about what they might think.	O ko ni lati ṣe aniyan nipa ohun ti wọn le ro.
It is impossible to know what.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati mọ kini.
I wonder if this will be me soon.	Mo Iyanu boya eyi yoo jẹ mi laipẹ.
You have to be in the best possible way.	O ni lati wa ni ọna ti o dara julọ.
We will do it because it needs to be done.	A yoo ṣe nitori pe o nilo lati ṣee.
He even liked his name.	O fẹran orukọ rẹ paapaa.
He took it with him everywhere.	O si mu o pẹlu rẹ nibi gbogbo.
What you know, you know.	Ohun ti o mọ, o mọ.
You don’t want to, obviously.	O ko fẹ, o han ni.
This is about everyone.	Eyi jẹ nipa gbogbo eniyan rẹ.
Can't decide.	Ko le pinnu.
We will do to men what we did to you.	A yoo ṣe si awọn ọkunrin ohun ti a ṣe si ọ.
And yours alone.	Ati tirẹ nikan.
That is a mistake.	Iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe.
He pulled out of his front pocket and looked down.	O fa lati inu apo iwaju rẹ o wo isalẹ.
Their story is our story.	Itan wọn ni itan wa.
Or what should be done for you.	Tabi ohun ti o yẹ lati ṣe fun ọ.
He was scared, but he knew the rules of the game.	O bẹru, ṣugbọn o mọ awọn ofin ti ere naa.
Find enough hours in the day to do everything.	Wa awọn wakati ti o to ni ọjọ lati ṣe ohun gbogbo.
We will come back to that.	A yoo pada wa si.
He doesn’t like himself.	Ko fẹran ara rẹ.
That’s about it.	Iyẹn jẹ nipa rẹ.
Can't talk long.	Ko le sọrọ gun.
It was nice out there.	O je dara jade nibẹ.
It will make it easier to handle.	Yoo jẹ ki o rọrun lati mu.
There is a surprise.	Iyalẹnu kan wa.
It was such a beautiful young thing.	O je iru kan lẹwa odo ohun.
He is here now.	O wa nibi ni bayi.
It may not be enough.	O tun le ma to.
You need to leave it for a long time.	O nilo lati fi silẹ fun igba pipẹ.
I had such a good time.	Mo ni iru kan ti o dara akoko.
It seems to continue forever.	O dabi pe o tẹsiwaju lailai.
I just had to make it through that week.	Mo kan ni lati ṣe nipasẹ ọsẹ naa.
It just recorded a lot.	O kan gba silẹ pupọ.
There is no right way.	Ko si ọna ti o tọ.
Well, you get the point.	O dara, o gba aaye naa.
I want to take my wife with me.	Mo fẹ lati mu iyawo mi lọ pẹlu mi.
All won side.	Gbogbo gba ẹgbẹ.
How interesting!	Bawo ni awon!
The day was beautiful.	Ọjọ naa lẹwa.
He said he would like to see them if he could.	O ni oun yoo fẹ lati ri wọn ti o ba le.
You don’t want to be evil.	O ko fẹ lati jẹ ibi.
Maybe it’s more important.	Boya o jẹ diẹ pataki.
Repeat several times.	Tun ni igba pupọ.
You must have given birth the first night here.	O gbọdọ ti bi ọmọ ni alẹ akọkọ nibi.
I worry about people.	Mo ṣe aniyan nipa awọn eniyan.
I am not buying a friend's wife.	Emi ko ṣe ifẹ si iyawo ọrẹ kan.
He said he would drink.	O sọ pe oun yoo mu.
They are both looking at me.	Awon mejeeji n wo mi.
That's your ear.	Iyẹn ni eti rẹ.
Everyone has to be in that working game.	Gbogbo eniyan ni lati wa ninu ere iṣẹ ṣiṣe yẹn.
He never talked to anyone, and he was always there himself.	Ko sọrọ si ẹnikan, ati pe o wa nigbagbogbo funrararẹ.
It’s about me, not yours.	O jẹ nipa mi, kii ṣe tirẹ.
A man in trouble with the law.	Ọkunrin kan ti o ni wahala pẹlu ofin.
They are everywhere.	Wọn wa nibi gbogbo.
They wonder why.	Wọn ṣe iyalẹnu idi.
They were created.	Won ni won da.
There are questions, however, and it is possible for a while.	Awọn ibeere wa, sibẹsibẹ, ati pe o ṣee ṣe fun igba diẹ.
But other than that, everything is fine.	Ṣugbọn miiran ju iyẹn lọ, ohun gbogbo dara.
He could not even agree.	Ko le paapaa ṣe adehun.
Everyone always wants more than enough.	Gbogbo eniyan nigbagbogbo fẹ diẹ sii ko to.
Of office space.	Ti aaye ọfiisi.
Good way.	Ọna ti o dara.
I have some money in my pocket.	Mo ni owo diẹ ninu apo mi.
But there was also time to ask about my personal life.	Ṣugbọn o tun wa akoko lati beere nipa igbesi aye ara ẹni mi.
I will not use them.	Emi kii yoo lo wọn.
So it depends on the time of year.	Nitorina o da lori akoko ti ọdun.
I'm just sorry.	Mo kan binu.
I'll be back in a few days.	Emi yoo pada wa ni awọn ọjọ diẹ.
And to me.	Ati si mi.
Give me nothing.	Fun mi ni ohunkohun.
Just forget that you will need to do that.	O kan gbagbe pe iwọ yoo nilo lati ṣe iyẹn.
You just can't.	O kan ko le.
It was impossible for him to remember the area.	Ko ṣee ṣe fun u lati ranti agbegbe naa.
This, in particular, will not work.	Eyi, paapaa, kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
Thus, they are beginning to catch fire.	Bayi, wọn ti bẹrẹ si ni ina.
Everything happens now.	Ohun gbogbo ṣẹlẹ ni bayi.
Can't wait to be.	Ko le duro jẹ.
I understand it.	Mo loye rẹ.
It is in your imagination.	O wa ninu oju inu rẹ.
It rains like rain.	O tọ bi ojo.
We arrived late from the party last night.	A de pẹ lati ibi ayẹyẹ alẹ ana.
Less than the best.	Kere ju ti o dara ju.
It is true today.	O wa ni otitọ loni.
But it was not there.	Ṣugbọn ko wa nibẹ.
You want to go everywhere, do everything, meet everyone.	O fẹ lati lọ si ibi gbogbo, ṣe ohun gbogbo, pade gbogbo eniyan.
She has never been in love.	O ti ko ni ife.
I have no idea.	Nko ni ero kankan.
Working on it, you have the most power.	Ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ, o ni agbara julọ.
Hard to move or to be around.	Gidigidi lati gbe tabi lati wa ni ayika.
Some people are young at one.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan jẹ ọmọde ni ọkan.
Your life has changed.	Igbesi aye rẹ ti yipada.
After you said this, you came to do the tests.	Lẹhin ti o ti sọ eyi, o wa lati ṣe awọn idanwo.
You already know all this.	O ti mọ gbogbo eyi tẹlẹ.
Notice how it is treated.	Ṣe akiyesi bi a ṣe tọju rẹ.
I don't want to do that again.	Emi ko fẹ tun ṣe bẹ.
Arrived on time.	Ti de ni akoko.
It doesn't work anymore.	Ko ṣiṣẹ mọ.
None of these things are there.	Ko si ọkan ninu nkan wọnyi ti o wa.
Someone is it.	Ẹnikan ni o.
We can call it something good.	A le pe e ni nkan ti o dara.
I don't know how to do that.	Emi ko mọ bi a ṣe le ṣe iyẹn.
That’s all that matters.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo nkan ti o ṣe pataki.
It is a thing of the past.	O jẹ ohun ti o ti kọja.
But he did not say why.	Ṣugbọn ko sọ idi naa.
This is good enough for me.	Eyi dara to fun mi.
I am not good at this.	Emi ko dara ni eyi.
That is important to be able to help them.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki lati ni anfani lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun wọn.
They do not ask for.	Wọn ko beere fun.
So go ahead.	Nitorina tẹsiwaju.
Other families do not have this.	Idile miiran ko ni eyi.
Love can buy.	Ife le ra.
Of course he started jumping all over the house.	Dajudaju o bẹrẹ si fo ni gbogbo ile naa.
There is no time for rest.	Ko si akoko fun isinmi.
My sister is planning to let it last forever.	Arabinrin mi n gbero lati jẹ ki o duro lailai.
We do not have.	A ko ni.
You can apply them to shoes.	O le lo wọn si bata bata.
She kissed her baby.	O fi ẹnu ki ọmọ rẹ.
I'll take it for you.	Emi yoo gba fun ọ.
He is always energetic and full of life.	O nigbagbogbo ni agbara ati kun fun igbesi aye.
There is no place like that.	Ko si aaye bi iru bẹẹ.
If anyone can please get advice on how to do this.	Ti ẹnikan ba le jọwọ gba imọran bi o ṣe le ṣe eyi.
He doesn't like that dog.	Ko fẹran aja yẹn.
I could not believe my eyes.	Emi ko le gbagbọ oju mi.
He said he was sorry he tried for the game.	O sọ pe o binu pe o gbiyanju fun ere naa.
If you have a family.	Ti o ba ni ebi kan.
He knocked on the door.	O lu ilẹkun.
The old days are gone.	Awọn ọjọ atijọ ti lọ.
The tree will tell its own story as it grows.	Igi naa yoo sọ itan ti ara rẹ bi o ti n dagba.
It is on fire now.	O ti wa ni ina ni bayi.
He didn’t pull away from that first minute.	Ko fa kuro ni iṣẹju akọkọ yẹn.
If you have to go, just go.	Ti o ba ni lati lọ, kan lọ.
How scary that can be.	Bawo ni iyẹn ṣe le bẹru to.
He didn't think about it.	Ko ronu nipa rẹ.
Let that go, though.	Jẹ ki iyẹn lọ, paapaa.
Many of these continue through life.	Pupọ ninu awọn wọnyi tẹsiwaju nipasẹ igbesi aye.
Do not go down the road.	Maṣe lọ si isalẹ opopona naa.
I picked it up.	Mo gbe e soke.
My wife is in my life.	Iyawo mi wa ninu aye mi.
He left them.	O fi wọn silẹ jẹ.
I need to get a new phone soon.	Mo ni lati gba foonu tuntun laipẹ.
She left her children.	O fi awọn ọmọ rẹ silẹ.
He was angry with her for something, and she killed him.	O binu si i fun nkan kan, o si n pa a.
In under a minute the three are down.	Ni labẹ iṣẹju kan awọn mẹta ti wa ni isalẹ.
But he is not an intelligent one.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọkan ti o ni oye.
It has come a long way.	O ti wa ọna pipẹ.
It takes a lot of time.	O gba akoko pupọ.
And he was just a boy.	Ati pe o jẹ ọmọkunrin nikan.
But there are others.	Ṣugbọn awọn miiran tun wa.
One has to let that pass.	Eniyan ni lati jẹ ki iyẹn kọja.
They have been doing it for a long time in a way.	Wọn ti ṣe fun igba pipẹ ni ọna kan.
The question doesn’t interest her.	Ibeere naa ko nifẹ rẹ.
Next month they will want something else.	Ni oṣu ti n bọ wọn yoo fẹ nkan miiran.
There are three possible reasons for this.	Awọn idi mẹta ti o ṣee ṣe fun eyi.
You must continue to try your best to get a job.	O gbọdọ tẹsiwaju lati gbiyanju ohun ti o dara julọ lati gba iṣẹ kan.
That’s all pretty fixed.	Ti o ni gbogbo lẹwa ti o wa titi.
Well, as it turns out, they are beautiful.	O dara, bi o ti wa ni jade, wọn lẹwa.
They did.	Wọn ṣe bẹ.
And you can leave.	Ati awọn ti o ti le kuro.
They say it has stuck up.	Wọn sọ pe o ti di soke.
Nothing likes them.	Nkankan ko fẹran wọn.
You can fly that one.	O le fo ti ọkan.
Happy big time, kids !.	E ku akoko nla, awọn ọmọ!.
Everyone is happy that he lost his job.	Inu gbogbo eniyan dun pe o padanu iṣẹ rẹ.
Start up.	Bẹrẹ soke.
There is another reason.	Idi miiran wa.
I just want to know where you are from.	Mo kan fẹ lati mọ ibiti o ti wa.
And we need room to be able to grow.	Ati pe a nilo yara lati ni anfani lati dagba.
Someone did this to me a long time ago.	Ẹnikan ṣe eyi fun mi ni igba pipẹ sẹhin.
Not a point at all.	Ko kan aaye rara.
And he lost two games.	Ati pe o padanu awọn ere meji.
Think what you want.	Ronu ohun ti o fẹ.
Was a car accident.	Je ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
I would say he has been at home for about a month.	Emi yoo sọ pe o wa ni ile fun bii oṣu kan.
The child has many loves.	Ọmọ naa ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ifẹ.
You have left me.	O ti sọ mi silẹ.
You can see that the missing letters are a word	O le rii pe awọn lẹta ti o padanu jẹ ọrọ kan
I have a very good idea.	Mo ni imọran to dara pupọ.
From your room.	Lati yara rẹ.
You want to hold her hand or touch her face.	O fẹ lati di ọwọ rẹ mu tabi fi ọwọ kan oju rẹ.
Some mouth and say.	Diẹ ninu awọn ẹnu ki o si sọ.
I never told you.	Emi ko sọ fun ọ rara.
I need to be done.	Mo nilo lati ṣee.
He did not stop.	Ko duro.
It is their job.	Iṣẹ́ wọn ni.
You need to find a way to grow.	O nilo lati wa ọna lati dagba.
It should not take more than a few hours.	Ko yẹ ki o gba diẹ sii ju awọn wakati diẹ lọ.
It goes right through here.	O tọ nipasẹ ibi.
It seems to be another test.	O dabi pe o jẹ idanwo miiran.
We are together for a while and in love.	A wa papọ fun igba diẹ ati ni ifẹ.
Open it and look inside.	Ṣi i o si wo inu.
I showed him my picture.	Mo fi aworan mi han fun u.
We do not know why, and it does not matter.	A ko mọ idi rẹ, ati pe ko ṣe pataki.
There are no good jobs around here.	Ko si awọn iṣẹ to dara ni ayika ibi.
Some of them don’t even have names.	Diẹ ninu wọn ko paapaa ni awọn orukọ.
And he stripped off his clothes also.	O si bọ́ aṣọ rẹ̀.
We can also play.	A le tun dun.
I say that to myself every morning.	Mo sọ bẹ fun ara mi ni gbogbo owurọ.
He said, it will be sure.	O sọ pe, yoo daju.
It seemed like a good idea.	O dabi enipe imọran to dara.
Our lives are what we do.	Igbesi aye wa jẹ ohun ti a ṣe.
The child suffered head injuries.	Ọmọ naa gba awọn ipalara ori.
He also used another one for such a thing.	O tun lo ọkan miiran fun iru nkan bẹẹ.
Her mother sat and read a book.	Iya rẹ joko o si ka iwe kan.
May you be able to benefit forever.	Ṣe o le ni anfani lailai.
Do not think too hard.	Maṣe ronu lile pupọ.
And he was the only child.	Ati pe o jẹ ọmọ nikan.
You can see.	O le wo.
I'm very happy.	Inu mi dun pupọ.
And it’s not good to look at me like that, either.	Ati pe ko dara lati wo mi bi iyẹn, boya.
It is either this or nothing.	O jẹ boya eyi tabi ohunkohun.
We have not heard from them yet.	A ko tii gbọ lati ọdọ wọn sibẹsibẹ.
I am a brother.	Arakunrin ni mi.
He can not just pull away.	Ko le kan fa kuro.
You have heard.	O ti gbọ.
His friend already worked at the company.	Ọrẹ tirẹ ti ṣiṣẹ tẹlẹ ni ile-iṣẹ naa.
And that is important to understand.	Ati pe iyẹn ṣe pataki lati ni oye.
I knew my wife would not feel that way.	Mo mọ pe iyawo mi ko ni rilara bẹ.
He stopped walking.	O duro rin.
You may have called me anything.	O le ti pe mi ohunkohun.
But his words penetrated me.	Ṣugbọn ọrọ rẹ wọ inu mi.
Use as little force as possible.	Lo agbara kekere bi o ti ṣee.
We have to get out.	A ni lati jade.
But few more are known.	Ṣugbọn diẹ miiran ni a mọ.
It's over.	O ti pari.
They can take care of it.	Wọn le tọju rẹ.
Nice to see them together.	O dara lati rii wọn papọ.
He has not started anything without it.	Ko tii bẹrẹ ohunkohun laisi rẹ.
I am sure you will want to live with me.	Mo da mi loju pe iwọ yoo fẹ lati gbe pẹlu mi.
But they did not do anything of the sort.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko ṣe ohunkohun ti iru.
It’s a little surprising, but it’s not that surprising.	O jẹ iyalẹnu diẹ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe iyalẹnu yẹn.
The children were left alone in the big house.	Awọn ọmọ ti a fi silẹ nikan ni ile nla.
We do not have to meet them.	A ko ni lati pade wọn.
And not just because of what he did to her.	Ati pe kii ṣe nitori ohun ti o ṣe si rẹ nikan.
But maybe that in itself is key.	Ṣugbọn boya iyẹn funrararẹ ni bọtini.
It takes a few hours.	O gba to wakati diẹ.
That was an hour of my life.	Iyẹn jẹ wakati kan ti igbesi aye mi.
I mean to do it tonight.	Mo tumọ lati ṣe ni alẹ oni.
It looks like you have an amazing trip.	O dabi pe o ni irin-ajo iyalẹnu kan.
I'm just talking to him tonight.	Mo kan n ba a sọrọ ni alẹ oni.
Be honest about what you think will sell.	Jẹ otitọ nipa ohun ti o ro pe yoo ta.
They will try to talk to me to help them.	Wọn yoo gbiyanju lati ba mi sọrọ lati ran wọn lọwọ.
That story is important to me.	Itan yẹn ṣe pataki fun mi.
I do not really love.	Emi ko nifẹ gaan.
But those times are gone.	Ṣugbọn awọn akoko yẹn ti lọ.
Questions needed.	Ibeere nilo.
It seems like my body knows what it needs.	O dabi pe ara mi mọ ohun ti o nilo.
There are two games.	Awọn ere meji ni.
I did nothing wrong.	Emi ko ṣe ohunkohun ti ko tọ.
He’s a very tough guy, but he has a great one.	O jẹ eniyan lile pupọ, ṣugbọn o ni ọkan nla.
Nothing at all.	Ko si nkankan rara.
This is true and important to remember.	Eyi jẹ otitọ ati pataki lati ranti.
I have used both for years without problems.	Mo ti lo mejeeji fun ọdun laisi awọn iṣoro.
I went through the same thing.	Mo ti lọ nipasẹ ohun kanna.
Maybe you won't get a new brother or sister.	Boya o ko ni gba arakunrin tabi arabinrin tuntun kan.
Take you to a restaurant.	Mu ọ lọ si ile ounjẹ kan.
But her eyes, once lifted, were amazing.	Ṣugbọn oju rẹ, ni kete ti a gbe soke, jẹ iyanu.
But they did.	Ṣugbọn wọn ṣe.
My house stands on a hill.	Ile mi duro lori oke kan.
For the captured image, only image processing is performed.	Fun aworan ti o gba, ṣiṣe aworan nikan ni a ṣe.
He arrived here at one point.	O de ibi ni akoko kan.
It has gone up.	O ti lo soke.
Students will be all they can carry.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe yoo jẹ gbogbo ohun ti wọn le gbe.
You may be the only one who wants to enjoy it.	O le jẹ nikan ni ọkan ti o fẹ gbadun rẹ.
But we are doing everything we can to stop that.	Ṣugbọn a n ṣe gbogbo ohun ti a le ṣe lati da duro yẹn.
We have to come.	A ni lati wa si.
Outdoor driveways.	Awọn ọna ile ti o wa ni ita.
I believe it is true.	Mo gbagbọ pe o jẹ otitọ.
If only something.	Ti o ba ti nikan nkankan.
someone asked.	ẹnikan beere.
It was very hot in the cottage.	O gbona pupọ ninu ile kekere naa.
The information is behind the truth.	Alaye naa wa lẹhin otitọ.
I do not know you.	Emi ko mọ ọ.
It is best not to think too much about it.	O dara julọ lati ma ronu pupọ nipa rẹ.
They have been saying this for months.	Wọn ti sọ nkan yii fun awọn oṣu.
How long has it been.	Bawo ni o ti pẹ to.
And that afternoon at that place, a wedding was taking place.	Ati pe ni ọsan yẹn ni ibi yẹn, igbeyawo kan n ṣe.
I never thought about it.	Emi ko ronu nipa rẹ rara.
I definitely broke it.	Mo dajudaju ṣe adehun rẹ.
It has been going on forever.	O ti n lọ lailai.
I don't want you to go.	Emi ko fẹ ki o lọ.
I am the one who should go.	Emi ni ẹniti o yẹ ki o lọ.
Give it a try and see what happens.	Fun o kan gbiyanju ati ki o wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Never heard from again.	Ko gbọ lati lẹẹkansi.
He graduated from high school.	O pari ile-iwe giga.
Information is a force for me.	Alaye jẹ agbara fun mi.
I have one.	Mo ni ọkan.
Not good at this time.	Ko dara ni akoko yii.
Maybe you do.	Boya o ṣe.
Everyone goes.	Gbogbo eniyan lo.
It works well in my area.	O n ṣiṣẹ daradara ni agbegbe mi.
Please see picture below.	Jọwọ wo aworan ni isalẹ.
Your whole body is able to eat better.	Gbogbo ara rẹ ni anfani lati jẹun dara julọ.
Not much was said.	A ko sọ pupọ paapaa.
I can't wait that long.	Emi ko le duro pe pẹ diẹ sii.
They must pull our feet.	Wọn gbọdọ fa ẹsẹ wa.
And we have everything, you know.	Ati pe a ni ohun gbogbo, o mọ.
All of these things need to be planned.	Gbogbo awọn nkan wọnyi nilo lati gbero.
My father told me it was a bad idea.	Baba mi sọ fun mi pe ero buburu ni.
Take a break, please.	Jọwọ, gba isinmi.
It doesn't matter now.	Ko ṣe pataki ni bayi.
We should not continue until we plan for the future.	A ko yẹ ki a tẹsiwaju titi ti a gbero fun ojo iwaju.
We will not do that.	A ko ni ṣe iyẹn.
He will know.	Oun yoo mọ.
This is a very important task.	Eyi jẹ iṣẹ pataki pupọ.
He was around them.	O wa ni ayika wọn.
Do not forget this rule.	Maṣe gbagbe ofin yii.
He can not have.	Ko le ni.
My friend started testing them myself.	Ọrẹ mi bẹrẹ si idanwo wọn funrararẹ.
It doesn’t seem to do.	Ko dabi pe o ṣe.
He is in trouble.	O wa ninu wahala.
Very good.	O dara pupọ.
The girl had a point.	Ọmọbirin naa ni aaye kan.
We are taught to sell.	A kọ wa lati ta.
I did not tell them anything they did not know.	Emi ko sọ fun wọn ohunkohun ti wọn ko mọ.
I still have to read up on it.	Mo tun ni lati ka soke lori rẹ.
More often than not, what would my dad say?	Diẹ sii nigba miiran, kini baba mi yoo sọ?
This is happening.	Eyi n ṣẹlẹ.
Better than other people.	O dara ju awọn eniyan miiran lọ.
I have had some trouble.	Mo ti ni wahala diẹ.
Hours upon hours are spent at the table.	Awọn wakati lori awọn wakati ni a lo ni tabili.
The dress did not come out.	Aṣọ naa ko jade.
They come through the work of law.	Wọn wa nipasẹ iṣẹ ti ofin.
Maybe it will kill some bad guys.	Boya o yoo pa diẹ ninu awọn eniyan buburu kuro.
All sleep in one room.	Gbogbo sun ni yara kan.
More like me.	Diẹ sii iru mi.
This song is about you, you think.	Orin yi jẹ nipa rẹ, o ro.
That was the best day of my life.	Iyẹn jẹ ọjọ ti o dara julọ ni igbesi aye mi.
It is forever.	O jẹ lailai.
I am in your house.	Mo wa ninu ile rẹ.
They go for them.	Wọn lọ nitori wọn.
Something about them.	Nkankan nipa wọn.
He wrote another.	O kọ miiran.
But no time.	Ṣugbọn ko si akoko.
But you want to know.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ lati mọ.
That is also a way to lose.	Iyẹn tun jẹ ọna lati padanu.
You will be amazing.	Iwọ yoo jẹ iyanu.
But he is not, perhaps.	Ṣugbọn oun kii ṣe iyẹn, boya.
They are not the group they were in the past.	Wọn kii ṣe ẹgbẹ ti wọn jẹ ni akoko to kọja.
There are many problems with this.	Awọn iṣoro pupọ wa nitori eyi.
People will be there.	Eniyan yoo wa nibẹ.
Change the game as you like.	Yi ere naa pada bi o ṣe fẹ.
See image below from this site.	Wo aworan ni isalẹ lati aaye yii.
The program has to work.	Eto naa ni lati ṣiṣẹ.
He is also not a man.	Oun naa kii ṣe ọkunrin.
You can buy them or make them.	O le ra wọn tabi ṣe wọn.
I decided not to go with the lights.	Mo pinnu lati ma lọ pẹlu awọn ina.
People in the towns began to arrive by bus.	Awọn eniyan ti o wa ni awọn ilu bẹrẹ si de nipasẹ ọkọ akero.
To bring together.	Lati mu lọ papọ.
His books are great and well worth their price.	Awọn iwe rẹ jẹ nla ati pe o tọ iye owo wọn daradara.
But that would be a complete mistake.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn yoo jẹ aṣiṣe patapata.
I am a few feet away.	Mo wa ni ẹsẹ diẹ diẹ.
Maybe not the future.	Boya kii ṣe iwaju.
That would be nice.	Iyẹn yoo dara.
I am alone.	Mo wa nikan.
We will starve.	Ebi yoo pa wa.
In my opinion, it did a great job this year.	Ni ero mi, o ṣe iṣẹ nla ni ọdun yii.
Now the question is whether you can keep it.	Bayi ibeere ni boya o le pa a mọ.
If the power goes out we do not even know.	Ti agbara ba jade a ko mọ paapaa.
I would not do so under other circumstances.	Emi kii yoo ṣe bẹ labẹ awọn ipo miiran.
The book is very interesting.	Iwe naa dun pupọ.
He did it.	O ṣe e.
You are there.	O ni o wa nibẹ.
I stay away from doctors.	Mo duro kuro lati awọn dokita.
We have what we are doing in front of the house.	A ni ohun ti a n ṣe ni iwaju ile.
But it will not be easy to get.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo rọrun lati gba.
They start singing.	Wọn bẹrẹ orin.
I can't sleep the other night.	Nko le sun ni alẹ miiran.
I have seen things done.	Mo ti ri awọn ohun ti o ṣe.
We are told to fear and give us reason.	A sọ fun wa lati bẹru ati fun wa ni idi.
At this time there is no such world.	Ni akoko yii ko si iru aye bẹẹ.
They have more hair on the face and body.	Wọn ni irun diẹ si oju ati ara.
Will have stories to tell for months.	Yoo ni awọn itan lati sọ fun awọn oṣu.
And it will hurt both.	Ati pe yoo ṣe ipalara fun awọn mejeeji.
Or they can not.	Tabi wọn ko le.
I think you will.	Mo ro pe iwọ yoo ṣe.
It was a fun thing to watch them do.	O jẹ ohun ti o dun lati wo wọn ṣe.
I saw what happened.	Mo ti rii ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Close your eyes, open your mouth.	Pa oju rẹ, ṣii ẹnu rẹ.
I do not see any problem with it.	Emi ko ri iṣoro pẹlu rẹ.
Always on your terms.	Nigbagbogbo lori awọn ofin rẹ.
He’s a great guy.	O ni eniyan nla kan.
If you find it, pick it up.	Ti o ba ri, gbe soke.
The river is full.	Odo naa ti kun.
She is a beautiful woman.	Obinrin lẹwa ni.
The company needs to comply with all company rules.	Ile-iṣẹ nilo lati ṣe akiyesi gbogbo awọn ofin ile-iṣẹ.
I do.	Mo tun ṣe.
I hope more.	Mo nireti diẹ sii.
When the doors open, they are inside.	Nigbati awọn ilẹkun ba ṣii, wọn wa ninu.
Some ideas, however, may repeat.	Diẹ ninu awọn ero, sibẹsibẹ, le tun ṣe.
The meal was cooked over an open fire.	A se ounjẹ naa lori ina ti o ṣi silẹ.
He decided to drop it.	O pinnu lati ju silẹ.
However, both spoke.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn mejeeji sọrọ.
You never read any of his stories.	O ko ka eyikeyi itan rẹ rara.
If it only works.	Ti o ba ṣiṣẹ nikan.
But let me start with that.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki n bẹrẹ pẹlu rẹ.
We did not end there.	A ko pari nibẹ.
Music is changing.	Orin ti n yipada.
I fear it.	Mo bẹru rẹ.
You can be with me.	O le wa pẹlu mi.
And that's when he hit me.	Ati awọn ti o ni nigbati o lu mi.
I don't even know what that means.	Emi ko paapaa mọ kini iyẹn tumọ si.
You can use money to get someone to build.	O le lo owo lati gba ẹnikan lati kọ.
In your home.	Ninu ile re.
I would like to give a home for my family.	Emi yoo fẹ lati fun ile kan fun idile mi.
And we don't know much about it yet.	Ati pe a ko mọ pupọ nipa rẹ sibẹsibẹ.
Observe the appointment time.	Ṣe akiyesi akoko ipinnu.
I would love to see it.	Mo nifẹ lati ri i.
Very small for me.	O kere pupọ fun mi.
But the words are not there.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọrọ ko si nibẹ.
It looks new.	O dabi tuntun.
He will come back.	Oun yoo pada wa.
Okay, this is amazing, no games.	O dara, eyi jẹ iyalẹnu, ko si awọn ere.
So you know they need to grow.	Ki o mọ pe wọn nilo lati dagba.
Any road that connects two cities.	Eyikeyi opopona ti o so meji ilu.
They could not believe their eyes.	Wọn ko le gbagbọ oju wọn.
Can you find the errors?	Ṣe o le rii awọn aṣiṣe?
I will need someone to take care of me.	Emi yoo nilo ẹnikan lati tọju mi.
It does a very good job for the person who really needs it.	O ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara pupọ fun eniyan ti o nilo ni otitọ.
You can be on the right track.	O le wa lori ọna ti o tọ.
How I got there.	Bawo ni mo ṣe wa nibẹ.
We will be here next year, '' he said.	A yoo wa nibi ni ọdun lẹhin, '' o sọ.
His father stood there.	Baba rẹ duro nibẹ.
Could not have done with it out.	Ko le ti ṣe pẹlu rẹ jade.
They want to feel it again.	Wọn fẹ lati lero rẹ lẹẹkansi.
I removed the device.	Mo ti ẹrọ naa kuro.
He began to call his father for advice.	O bẹrẹ si pe baba rẹ fun imọran.
He took me away.	O mu mi lọ.
Not all students learn.	Kii ṣe gbogbo awọn ọmọ ile-iwe kọ.
To lose it would be to lose them.	Lati padanu rẹ yoo jẹ lati padanu wọn.
Of course it is not the first time anyone will use.	Dajudaju kii ṣe igba akọkọ ti ẹnikẹni yoo lo.
And this is the right time.	Ati pe eyi ni akoko ti o tọ.
Now he will give you even a bad time.	Bayi oun yoo fun ọ ni akoko buburu paapaa.
He was angry and really wanted to quit his job early.	O binu o si fẹ gaan lati fi iṣẹ silẹ ni kutukutu.
That is your thing.	Nkan tirẹ niyẹn.
Something is wrong, and you need to find out what.	Nkankan ti ko tọ, ati pe o nilo lati wa kini.
Some more information if needed.	Diẹ ninu awọn alaye diẹ sii ti o ba nilo.
What is that?	Kini yẹn?
You can find the story from here.	O le wa itan naa lati ibi.
I let him give me the money.	Mo jẹ ki o fun mi ni owo naa.
She is from a small town.	O wa lati ilu kekere kan.
Hurry, we are already late.	Yara, a ti pẹ tẹlẹ.
There are few people who eat.	Awọn eniyan diẹ wa ti o jẹun.
That is not really true.	Iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ ni otitọ.
I have to get it down.	Mo gbọdọ gba ni isalẹ.
But there are a few questions.	Ṣugbọn awọn ibeere diẹ wa.
Say 'stand, stand, stand up'.	Wipe 'duro, duro, duro soke'.
Not inserted.	Ko fi sii.
I found myself in the body.	Mo ti ri ara mi ninu ara.
I can wait.	Mo le duro.
No one will feel.	Ko si ọkan yoo lero.
Maybe people should want to the same background.	Boya eniyan yẹ ki o fẹ lati kanna lẹhin.
This is very important to me, please believe me.	Eyi ṣe pataki pupọ fun mi, jọwọ gba mi gbọ.
He woke up early this morning.	O dide ni kutukutu owurọ yi.
See your book.	Wo iwe rẹ.
Until it shows, that is.	Titi ti o fi han, iyẹn ni.
We forget how small we are.	A gbagbe bi a ṣe kere to.
You will have to do better than ever.	Iwọ yoo ni lati ṣe daradara ju lailai.
This is not a new problem.	Eyi kii ṣe iṣoro tuntun.
See where you walk sometimes.	Wo ibi ti o n rin ni igba miiran.
I will remember you forever.	Emi o ranti rẹ lailai.
But he could not find.	Sugbon ko le ri.
But the situation did not get out of hand.	Ṣugbọn ipo naa ko jade ni ọwọ.
Very good for you.	O dara pupọ fun ọ.
My teacher said this was not possible.	Olukọ mi sọ pe eyi ko ṣee ṣe.
He spent days with his doctor.	O lo awọn ọjọ pẹlu dokita rẹ.
Like, me, today.	Bii, emi, loni.
Do not be afraid to touch it if you will.	Maṣe bẹru lati fi ọwọ kan rẹ ti o ba fẹ.
There are people.	Awọn eniyan wa.
Something will go wrong, just know it.	Nkankan yoo lọ aṣiṣe, o kan mọ ọ.
It looks like you and I.	O dabi iwọ ati emi.
That was all you expected.	Ohun ti o ti reti nikan niyẹn.
And it almost did.	Ati pe o fẹrẹ ṣe.
I need to know more.	Mo ni lati mọ diẹ sii.
We talked a lot and we became very good friends.	A sọrọ pupọ a si di ọrẹ pupọ.
Let me tell you out, old friend.	Jẹ ki n sọ jade fun ọ, ọrẹ atijọ.
She just loves to sit and sing songs.	O kan nifẹ lati joko ati kọ awọn orin.
He asked us.	O beere wa.
That should be your goal.	Iyẹn gbọdọ jẹ ipinnu rẹ.
To be able to force yourself.	Lati ni anfani lati fi agbara mu ara rẹ.
Never forget that.	Maṣe gbagbe iyẹn lailai.
They have no food.	Wọn ko ni ounjẹ.
And he turned away.	O si yipada kuro.
Where is that restaurant?	Nibo ni ile ounjẹ yẹn wa?
Must be.	O ni lati jẹ.
My house is simple, but it is good for me.	Ile mi rọrun, ṣugbọn o dara fun mi.
I see two problems.	Mo ri awọn iṣoro meji.
No news no news.	Ko si iroyin ko si iroyin.
It was a good move.	O je kan ti o dara Gbe.
He is on my side.	O wa ni ẹgbẹ mi.
No money on me.	Ko si owo lori mi.
This game only.	Ere yi nikan.
This is a great world.	Eyi jẹ aye nla.
Temporary.	Fun igba diẹ.
We look into the past.	A wo sinu awọn ti o ti kọja.
Not nearly enough.	Ko ti fẹrẹ to.
There are no trees here.	Ko si awọn igi nibi.
I have to be with someone.	Mo ni lati wa pẹlu ẹnikan.
They are in the same class.	Wọn ti wa ni kilasi kanna.
I am not like those men.	Emi ko dabi awọn ọkunrin yẹn.
Nothing was good enough for him.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣe ti o dara to fun u.
You cannot see or meet what is coming to you.	O ko le rii tabi pade ohun ti n bọ si ọ.
After a while he stopped to listen.	Lẹhin igba diẹ o duro lati gbọ.
Please come back to me.	Jọwọ pada wa fun mi.
We look forward to helping you.	Inu wa yoo dun lati ran ọ lọwọ.
He said he could not see.	O so wipe o ko le ri.
I got up and left it on the table.	Mo dide ki o si fi i silẹ lori tabili.
I didn’t do a good job on it.	Emi ko ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara lori rẹ.
He could not think.	Ko le ronu.
You don’t even know it.	O ko paapaa mọ ọ.
No, no, my friend.	Rara, rara, ọrẹ mi.
For the money.	Fun owo naa.
I couldn’t believe how surprised this lifted me.	Emi ko le gbagbọ bi iyalẹnu eyi ṣe gbe mi.
I have not stopped.	Emi ko ba ti duro.
Why he was there, he said, and he was there.	Kilode ti o wa nibẹ, o sọ pe, ati pe o wa nibẹ.
So we are completely on our own.	Nitorina a wa patapata lori ara wa.
Much work has been completed.	Ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ ti pari.
There is a point, he said.	Aaye naa wa, o sọ.
The child seemed to know what he was doing.	Ọmọ naa dabi ẹni pe o mọ ohun ti o n ṣe.
I made my mother anxious enough.	Mo ṣe iya mi ni aniyan to.
I can't see that.	Emi ko le wo iyẹn.
Everything you lose is yours.	Gbogbo nkan ti o padanu ni iwọ.
We have nothing to do with that.	A ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu iyẹn.
They do, together.	Wọn ṣe, papọ.
I don’t want to see what’s on there.	Emi ko fẹ lati ri ohun ti o wa lori nibẹ.
They are a fixed price.	Wọn jẹ iye owo ti o wa titi.
Pick one and go with it.	Mu ọkan ki o si lọ pẹlu rẹ.
Men are all the same.	Awọn ọkunrin ni gbogbo awọn kanna.
We are there to help !.	A wa nibẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ!.
Just break in years.	O kan adehun ni ọdun.
You don’t think about anything else.	O ko ronu nipa ohunkohun miiran.
That sounds like a mistake, doesn't it?	Iyẹn dabi aṣiṣe, ṣe ko?
No one is wrong.	Ko si ọkan ti o jẹ aṣiṣe.
It should go back down and give.	O yẹ ki o pada si isalẹ ki o fun ni.
Bring your journey back into your own hands.	Mu irin-ajo rẹ pada si ọwọ ara rẹ.
I stay home.	Emi ile duro.
I have to go outside.	Mo ni lati lọ si ita.
You may know it.	O le mọ ọ.
She was happy to herself.	Inu rẹ dun si ara rẹ.
There is a way you can do something.	Ọna kan wa ti o le ṣe nkan kan.
No, it's all there.	Rara, gbogbo rẹ wa nibẹ.
No personal sense.	Ko si ori ti ara ẹni.
That’s all that matters to him.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo ohun ti o ṣe pataki fun u.
At least not outside.	O kere kii ṣe ni ita.
He did other things first.	O ṣe awọn ohun miiran akọkọ.
I do not feel well.	Ara mi ko dara.
At one time, he was in love with this house.	Ni akoko kan, o ti nifẹ ile yii.
Please do not forget that.	Jọwọ maṣe gbagbe iyẹn.
It looks like a man can.	O dabi bi ọkunrin kan le.
He looks back.	O wo ẹhin.
Not so over there.	Ko bẹ lori nibẹ.
Either way you look at it.	Eyikeyi ọna ti o wo ni o.
The police charge money to look the other way.	Awọn ọlọpa gba owo lati wo ọna miiran.
She bathed and slept.	O wẹ ati ki o sun.
I do not see anything.	Nko ri kankan.
One might wonder if anything is happening at all.	Eniyan le ṣe iyalẹnu boya ohunkohun n ṣẹlẹ rara.
Hit jump to hear what they have to say.	Lu fo lati gbọ ohun ti wọn ni lati sọ.
His name is alive.	Orukọ rẹ wa laaye.
But the tea.	Ṣugbọn tii naa.
Yes, we need more help.	Yoo jẹ, a nilo iranlọwọ diẹ sii.
Something hard.	Nkan lile.
What works for you today, may not work tomorrow.	Ohun ti n ṣiṣẹ fun ọ loni, le ma ṣiṣẹ ni ọla.
You can change the.	O le yi awọn.
You can see it.	O le wo o.
People are still there.	Awọn eniyan ṣi wa nibẹ.
If not handled properly, it can cause serious harm.	Ti ko ba mu daradara, o le fa ipalara nla.
He is already dead.	O ti ku tẹlẹ.
They seem to be right that people are beginning to believe in them.	Wọn dabi ẹni pe o tọ pe eniyan bẹrẹ lati gbagbọ ninu wọn.
One of the men asked for a pair of shoes.	Ọkan ninu awọn ọkunrin beere fun bata bata.
We know.	A mọ.
I was the only person in the car.	Emi nikan ni eniyan ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
He was, in a way, dead.	O jẹ, ni ọna kan, o ti ku.
Water is also used to generate electricity.	Omi ni a tun lo lati ṣe ina ina.
The book has long since been removed as irrelevant.	Iwe naa ti pẹ lati igba ti a ti yọ kuro bi ko ṣe pataki.
When they reach us, we can talk to them.	Nigbati wọn ba de ọdọ wa, a le ba wọn sọrọ.
If you say enough time it must be true.	Ti o ba sọ awọn akoko ti o to o gbọdọ jẹ otitọ.
You can’t run, you hide.	O ko le ṣiṣe, o tọju.
Hard on the body.	Lile lori ara.
But there are reasons that may not be.	Ṣugbọn awọn idi wa ti ko le jẹ.
I do not know, maybe just something you can do.	Emi ko mọ, boya o kan nkankan ti o le se.
They are just boys.	Wọn jẹ ọmọkunrin nikan.
Do not compromise with wisdom, he said.	Maṣe ṣe adehun pẹlu ọgbọn, o sọ.
The child believes that, too.	Ọmọ naa gbagbọ pe, paapaa.
He will not do anything to you anymore.	Ko ni ṣe ohunkohun si ọ mọ.
You also have to get a job.	O tun ni lati gba iṣẹ.
You can see for yourself.	O le rii fun ara rẹ.
He started the car.	O bẹrẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
To be small of that device is incredibly simple.	Lati jẹ nkan kekere ti ẹrọ yẹn jẹ iyalẹnu iyalẹnu.
Very hot day.	Ọjọ gbona pupọ.
You can not create something like that.	O ko le da nkankan bi wipe.
When it is written.	Nigbati o ti kọ.
We talked.	A ti sọrọ.
Start with a small amount and build up over time.	Bẹrẹ pẹlu iye kekere kan ki o kọ soke ni akoko pupọ.
Many beautiful songs have been written about love.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn orin lẹwa ti kọ nipa ifẹ.
But it can not.	Sugbon ko le.
You go to it.	O lọ si o.
He will have new friends today.	Oun yoo ni awọn ọrẹ tuntun loni.
You know, very good at this point.	O mọ, o dara pupọ ni aaye yii.
Everybody.	Gbogbo eniyan.
"Old ways"	"Awọn ọna atijọ"
But you can not kill a thought.	Sugbon o ko le pa ero kan.
Just look at her face.	O kan wo oju rẹ.
I do not like it.	Nko feran re.
Have a little how to say problems and it is there.	Ni diẹ bi o ṣe sọ awọn iṣoro ati pe o wa nibẹ.
He refuses to come.	O kọ lati wa.
It was their only chance.	O je wọn nikan anfani.
He has been working with her for only two weeks.	O ti n ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ fun ọsẹ meji nikan.
It has been hard over the last two years with my injuries.	O ti jẹ lile ni ọdun meji to kọja pẹlu awọn ipalara mi.
It stops you.	O n da ọ duro.
It is also a mistake.	O tun jẹ aṣiṣe.
What do you have to lose?	Kini o ni lati padanu?
You can not talk and listen at the same time.	O ko le sọrọ ati ki o gbọ ni akoko kanna.
Or in a tree.	Tabi ni a igi.
They meet deadlines all the time.	Wọn pade awọn akoko ipari ni gbogbo igba.
So he talks a little.	Nitorina o sọrọ diẹ.
Some amazing games are made here.	Diẹ ninu awọn ere iyalẹnu ni a ṣe nibi.
But we do not know it down the road.	Sugbon a ko mọ ti o si isalẹ awọn ọna.
He will come to you.	Oun yoo wa si ọdọ rẹ.
Not everyone has to do the same things for a group.	Ko gbogbo eniyan ni lati ṣe awọn ohun kanna fun ẹgbẹ kan.
If you are serious about this, you will need to work harder.	Ti o ba jẹ pataki nipa eyi, iwọ yoo nilo lati ṣiṣẹ le.
The game is played by two players.	Awọn ere ti wa ni mu ṣiṣẹ nipa meji awọn ẹrọ orin.
He said he was not sure.	O sọ pe ko da oun loju.
Two things have changed.	Nkan meji ti yipada.
You have not caught enough people.	O ko ti mu eniyan to.
That is what got me.	Ohun ti o gba mi niyẹn.
You always live in time.	O nigbagbogbo gbe ni akoko.
The problems are very simple.	Awọn iṣoro wa rọrun pupọ.
I would like to know what you think.	Emi yoo fẹ lati mọ ohun ti o ro.
I would call whatever they wanted.	Emi yoo pe ohunkohun ti wọn fẹ.
He will never return to you as a home.	Oun yoo ko pada si o bi a ile.
They should not know.	Wọn ko yẹ ki o mọ.
But it is important to understand it.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe pataki lati ni oye rẹ.
This is what you are looking for.	Eyi ni ohun ti o n wa.
I do not know.	Emi ko ti mọ.
You have to decide how much you can afford.	O gbọdọ pinnu iye ti o le mu.
The road is out.	Ni opopona ti fun jade.
His power is in question.	Agbara rẹ ti ni ibeere.
You want to see her face.	O fẹ lati ri oju rẹ.
He hurried out of the meeting.	O yara jade kuro ni ipade naa.
You know nothing.	O ko mọ nkankan.
But he has killed two people.	Ṣugbọn o ti pa eniyan meji.
But, one day, it will.	Ṣugbọn, ni ọjọ kan, yoo.
My father killed my mother.	Baba mi pa iya mi.
Everything goes in your mouth.	Ohun gbogbo n lọ ni ẹnu rẹ.
Or, well.	Tabi, daradara.
I have to live.	Mo ni lati ni igbesi aye.
What matters is you.	Ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni iwọ.
And when you least expect.	Ati nigbati o kere reti.
He’s always trying to do the right thing.	O n gbiyanju nigbagbogbo lati ṣe ohun ti o tọ.
You don’t understand it at all, it’s not an issue.	O ko loye rẹ rara, kii ṣe ọrọ kan.
He raised one hand.	O gbe ọwọ kan soke.
You do not like it.	O ko fẹran rẹ.
It is under the eyes of the back.	O wa labẹ oju ti ẹhin.
You say something, you say something.	O sọ nkankan, o sọ nkankan.
Nothing of value included.	Ko si ohun ti iye ninu.
Tell that story.	Sọ itan yẹn.
Nothing will ever change.	Ko si ohun ti yoo lailai yi.
Now is your time to do it for them.	Bayi o jẹ akoko rẹ lati ṣe fun wọn.
Which you have to believe.	Eyi ti o ni lati gbagbọ.
I'm talking to you.	Mo n sọ fun mi sọrọ.
When they are happy, they cannot think.	Nigbati inu wọn ba dun, wọn ko le ronu.
It doesn’t let me go with anything.	Ko jẹ ki n lọ pẹlu ohunkohun.
We are hit with fire.	A ti wa ni lu pẹlu ina.
Some not up.	Diẹ ninu awọn ko soke.
I have not heard from him in two years.	Emi ko tii gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ ni ọdun meji.
I would not get up for dinner at that time.	Emi kii yoo dide fun ounjẹ alẹ ni akoko yẹn.
But still, he stuck to it.	Ṣugbọn sibẹsibẹ, o duro lori rẹ.
Get up and make a bed.	Dide ki o si ṣe ibusun.
Maybe just for ourselves.	Boya o kan fun wa ni ara wa.
I talked to him on the phone for a while.	Mo ba a sọrọ lori foonu ni igba diẹ.
They hurt.	Wọn ṣe ipalara.
Look, he said.	Wo o, o sọ.
He did his best.	O ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ.
You are not here by life.	Iwọ ko wa nibi nipasẹ aye.
This activity requires good physical strength.	Iṣẹ yii nilo agbara ti ara to dara.
But the mother continued to stand.	Ṣugbọn iya naa tẹsiwaju lati duro.
All the kids are just so great.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọ ni o kan ki nla.
What a great reason.	Kini idi nla.
You'd so need not be there.	O fẹ bẹ nilo lati ma wa nibẹ.
You deserve to meet your friend.	O yẹ lati pade ọrẹ rẹ.
Look at the accident.	Wo ijamba naa.
She loves boys.	O feran awọn ọmọkunrin.
That is not possible.	Iyẹn ko ṣee ṣe.
This surprised me.	Eyi mu mi ni iyalẹnu.
See if you can find the one that matters.	Wo boya o le rii eyi ti o ṣe pataki.
Body in the bag.	Ara ninu apo.
Maybe it's time to talk to each other.	Boya o to akoko ti a ba ara wa sọrọ.
I need to write it back.	Mo nilo lati kọ rẹ pada.
A mother has been asked not to contact her daughter anymore.	A ti beere fun iya kan lati ko kan si ọmọbirin rẹ mọ.
And you need to stop.	Ati pe o nilo lati da.
Make sure your clothes are clean	Rii daju pe aṣọ rẹ mọ
I can not think at all.	Emi ko le ronu rara.
He looked up.	O wo soke.
Only three names remain.	Awọn orukọ mẹta nikan ni o ku.
And how your child can recognize you.	Ati pe bi ọmọ rẹ ṣe le mọ ọ.
They are interesting.	Wọn ti wa ni awon.
But this is a mistake.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
I believe this is the problem.	Mo gbagbọ pe eyi ni iṣoro naa.
Not the same situation.	Kii ṣe ipo kanna.
It is not available.	O ko wa.
You look down most of the time.	O wo isalẹ pupọ julọ igba.
It will never be over.	O yoo ko ti kọja.
I look forward to doing that.	Mo n reti lati ṣe iyẹn.
We continue to think of them as fixed but they are not.	A tẹsiwaju lati ronu wọn bi ti o wa titi ṣugbọn wọn kii ṣe.
He said so.	O sọ bẹẹ.
But the body will continue.	Ṣugbọn ara yoo tẹsiwaju.
After the water comes out, remove from the heat.	Lẹhin ti omi ti jade, yọ kuro ninu ina.
But he did not laugh.	Ṣugbọn ko rẹrin.
Has your meal arrived?	Njẹ ounjẹ rẹ ti de?
It is impossible not to.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati ma ṣe.
He didn’t think much about it.	Ko ronu pupọ nipa rẹ.
Just the letter.	O kan lẹta naa.
You will not even want.	Iwọ kii yoo paapaa fẹ.
You know what will happen.	O mọ ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
It will not help you to get girls.	Kii yoo ran ọ lọwọ lati gba awọn ọmọbirin.
Which you want to try to pull already.	Eyi ti o fẹ gbiyanju lati fa tẹlẹ.
It is to try to grow.	O jẹ lati gbiyanju lati dagba.
I want to help with your book.	Mo fẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ pẹlu iwe rẹ.
I do not expect today to be so hard.	Ko nireti loni lati jẹ lile bẹ.
You're right.	O tọ.
Did not find it.	Ko ri i.
Two ero ku.	Meji ero ku.
It happens, you know.	O ṣẹlẹ, o mọ.
We have no idea what it might mean or what it is.	A ko ni imọran kini o le tumọ si tabi kini o jẹ.
You can almost see.	O le fẹrẹ rii.
They look at each other.	Won wo ara won.
And you see that over.	Ati pe o rii iyẹn lori.
You would have died.	Iwọ yoo ti ku.
I always think about this of course.	Mo nigbagbogbo ro nipa eyi dajudaju.
Can hear from you.	Le gbọ lati rẹ.
You have a lot to lose if they don’t.	O ni pupọ lati padanu ti wọn ko ba ṣe.
But there is a small problem.	Ṣugbọn iṣoro kekere kan wa.
Nothing else can be heard.	Ko si ohun miiran ti a le gbọ.
I like the way you feel.	Mo fẹran ọna ti o lero.
It was the first thing he said since everyone arrived.	O jẹ ohun akọkọ ti o sọ lati igba ti gbogbo eniyan de.
This is hard for most people.	Eyi jẹ lile fun ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
Things in another house.	Awọn nkan ti o wa ninu ile miiran.
Do what you want from this.	Ṣe ohun ti o fẹ lati eyi.
He is powerful.	O si ni agbara.
He left them there for a few minutes.	O fi wọn silẹ nibẹ fun iṣẹju diẹ.
I just really was not myself.	Mo ti o kan gan je ko ara mi.
This is a group of people.	Eyi jẹ ẹgbẹ ti gbogbo eniyan.
You need to listen.	O nilo lati gbọ.
He longed for the cause of the accident.	O gun lori idi ijamba naa.
He wants to forget now.	O fe gbagbe bayi.
I have already read that book.	Mo ti ka iwe yẹn tẹlẹ.
It hurts every week.	O ṣe ipalara fun gbogbo ọsẹ.
I found some material.	Mo ti rii diẹ ninu awọn ohun elo.
There is no house at this time.	Ko si ile ni wakati yii.
No one was involved.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa ninu.
I don’t know how you know that.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe mọ iyẹn.
I am older than you know.	Mo ti dagba ju ti o mọ.
Listen to it as soon as possible.	Gbọ e ni kete bi o ti ṣee.
Some are, some are not.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni o, diẹ ninu awọn ko.
Of course they do.	Dajudaju wọn ṣe.
You have not done it yet.	O ko tii ṣe sibẹsibẹ.
And it won’t come from a point of interest.	Ati pe kii yoo wa lati aaye ti o ni anfani.
You are doing two things.	Nkan meji lo n se.
And a lot more to the fire than that.	Ati pe ọpọlọpọ diẹ sii si ina ju iyẹn lọ.
She walks around the table, hands in her pockets.	O rin ni ayika tabili, ọwọ ninu awọn apo rẹ.
I have many children and a husband who has left me.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọ ati ọkọ kan ti o ti fi mi silẹ.
We will keep that.	A yoo tọju iyẹn.
No you don’t have to work.	Rara o ko ni lati ṣiṣẹ.
It makes me happy.	O ni inu mi dun.
That doesn’t sound right.	Eyi ko dun pe o tọ.
I was worried about the meeting.	Mo ṣe aniyan nipa ipade.
At least it has given me space to look.	O kere o ti fun mi ni aye lati wo.
It can be difficult.	O le nira.
But see you do.	Ṣugbọn wo o ṣe.
We will buy food, water, clothes.	A yoo ra ounjẹ, omi, aṣọ.
His friends tried to say small things.	Awọn ọrẹ rẹ gbiyanju lati sọ ọrọ kekere.
And before.	Ati ṣaaju.
There are two types of schools in the area.	Awọn iru ile-iwe meji wa ni agbegbe naa.
People hurt them.	Eniyan ba wọn jẹ.
I have seen this.	Mo ti rii eyi.
So, back to love.	Nitorina, pada si ifẹ.
The police will want you and me down there first.	Ọlọpa yoo fẹ iwọ ati emi ni isalẹ wa nibẹ ni akọkọ.
I can't even see what it is.	Emi ko le paapaa rii kini o jẹ.
This requires several weeks.	Eyi nilo fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọsẹ.
I think they are solid, because no one is around.	Mo ro pe wọn ti ri to, nitori ko si ẹnikan ni ayika.
At that time nothing was left of them at all.	Ni akoko yẹn ko si nkankan ti o ku ninu wọn rara.
I really like it a little.	Mo nifẹ rẹ gaan kan diẹ.
Okay, maybe that is true.	O dara, boya iyẹn jẹ otitọ.
I know this will come as a surprise to you.	Mo mọ pe eyi yoo wa bi iyalẹnu fun ọ.
He has done the best for him, there is no question of that.	O ti ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ fun u, ko si ibeere ti iyẹn.
It is the most important thing right now.	O jẹ ohun pataki julọ ni bayi.
That’s the only time.	Iyẹn nikan ni akoko.
You have more, especially.	O ni diẹ sii, paapaa.
I wanted to see my mother with my own eyes.	Mo fe lati ri iya mi pẹlu ara mi oju.
He was a great man but the work was great.	O jẹ eniyan nla ṣugbọn iṣẹ naa jẹ nla.
Players do not receive money on time or do not pay.	Awọn ẹrọ orin ko gba owo ni akoko tabi ko san.
But before the chance, they make love again.	Ṣugbọn ṣaaju ki o to ni anfani, wọn tun ṣe ifẹ lẹẹkansi.
We did not see him and we never heard of him.	A ko ri i ati pe a ko gbọ nipa rẹ rara.
I must know.	Mo gbọdọ mọ.
I don’t expect to be that person.	Emi ko nireti lati jẹ eniyan yẹn.
Maybe not for you but for me.	Boya kii ṣe fun ọ ṣugbọn fun mi.
However there is also power in doing so.	Sibẹsibẹ agbara tun wa ninu ṣiṣe bẹ.
The bride's father must accept.	Baba iyawo gbọdọ gba.
And of his mother.	Ati ti iya rẹ wa.
However, it is not that simple.	Sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe pe o rọrun.
It really scared me for a minute there.	O bẹru mi gaan fun iṣẹju kan nibẹ.
In this test, the water is hot.	Ninu idanwo yii, omi ti gbona.
It's changing.	O n yipada.
I just don’t like them around me.	Mo kan ko fẹ wọn ni ayika mi.
You’ve said it yourself.	O ti sọ funrararẹ.
He had made a bag off himself.	O ti ṣe apo pa ara rẹ.
They are watching you.	Won n wo o.
I'll get back to you.	Emi yoo pada si ọdọ rẹ.
She has a passion to learn.	O ni ifẹ lati kọ ẹkọ.
He will never do this again.	Oun kii yoo tun ṣe eyi mọ.
I give you earth.	Mo fun o ni ile aye.
However, this is not necessary.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi ko nilo bẹ.
I'll see your wife.	Emi yoo ri iyawo rẹ.
We will take care of it.	A yoo tọju rẹ.
And why they don’t.	Ati idi ti wọn ko ṣe.
I grew up with it.	Mo dagba pẹlu rẹ.
My parents are not there watching me every week.	Awọn obi mi ko wa nibẹ ti n wo mi ni gbogbo ọsẹ.
I’m here to get it all.	Mo wa nibi lati gba gbogbo rẹ.
It doesn't stop at all.	Ko da duro rara.
It will not rain today.	Ojo ko ni ro loni.
See this.	Wo eleyi.
This dress is special to me.	Aṣọ yii jẹ pataki fun mi.
And sometimes you have to find something you need.	Ati nigba miiran o ni lati wa nkan ti o nilo.
He ran out.	O sare jade.
We have to hope.	A ni lati nireti.
Now, he is building a house and starting our life together.	Bayi, o n kọ ile ati bẹrẹ igbesi aye wa papọ.
I may or may not agree.	Mo le tabi ko le gba.
You should make the plan.	O yẹ ki o ṣe eto naa.
Who is this boat?	Tani ọkọ oju omi yii?
Continue the amazing work.	Tẹsiwaju iṣẹ iyalẹnu naa.
He is winning.	O si n gba.
He will become a father.	Oun yoo di baba.
The best way is to find.	Ọna ti o dara julọ ni lati wa.
How do you do this?	Bawo ni o ṣe ṣe eyi?
I am in trouble.	Mo wa ninu wahala.
Something is happening.	Nkankan n ṣẹlẹ.
We know where he lives.	A mọ ibi ti o ngbe.
He would not let us go home.	Ko jẹ ki a lọ si ile.
True, he loves it.	Otitọ ni, o nifẹ rẹ.
And there is nothing.	Ati pe ko si nkan ti o wa.
Just do not eat in front of any small children.	O kan maṣe jẹun ni iwaju awọn ọmọde kekere eyikeyi.
Not for your school.	Kii ṣe fun ile-iwe rẹ.
Not until it's over.	Ko titi o fi pari.
There are simple things we can do.	Awọn nkan ti o rọrun wa ti a le ṣe.
The question you ask may need special attention.	Ibeere ti o beere le nilo pataki.
And appropriate.	Ati ki o yẹ.
If you are tired, you should go to bed.	Ti o ba re o, o yẹ ki o lọ si ibusun.
Or, before that, on his mother.	Tabi, ṣaaju pe, lori iya rẹ.
Drink it as much as possible.	Mu u mu bi o ti ṣee ṣe.
He is a young doctor.	O jẹ ọdọ dokita.
It's out.	O jade.
You know a lot of very important things.	O mọ ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan to ṣe pataki pupọ.
And not only that.	Kii ṣe iyẹn nikan.
They have not told him the truth.	Wọn ko ti sọ otitọ fun u.
That makes a deal.	Iyẹn n ṣe adehun kan.
She's scared, but she can do it.	O bẹru, ṣugbọn o le ṣe.
You should also be here.	O tun yẹ ki o wa nibi.
It's not what you want at all.	Kii ṣe ohun ti o fẹ rara.
I do not accept that.	Emi ko gba iyẹn.
You will be glad you did.	Inu rẹ yoo dun pe o ṣe.
But his ideas are not new.	Ṣugbọn awọn ero rẹ kii ṣe tuntun.
This can be done several times.	Eyi le ṣee ṣe ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
No one will miss them, you know.	Ko si ọkan yoo padanu wọn, o mọ.
I have nothing.	Nko ni nkankan.
Of course they started it.	Dajudaju wọn bẹrẹ rẹ.
I would be right.	Emi yoo tọ.
Nothing really happened.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ gaan.
By that time, the work had changed.	Ni akoko yẹn, iṣẹ naa ti yipada.
This is not the streets, anymore.	Eyi kii ṣe awọn ita, mọ.
You can have boys.	O le ni awọn ọmọkunrin.
I don't want to get up anymore.	Emi ko fẹ lati dide mọ.
Please delete that.	Jọwọ pa iyẹn.
This is at least what one would expect in a local experience.	Eyi ni o kere ju ohun ti ọkan yoo reti ni imọran agbegbe kan.
Okay, things will be understandable.	O dara, awọn nkan ti yoo jẹ oye.
Be the mother who allows mistakes.	Jẹ iya ti o fun laaye awọn aṣiṣe.
Also with key and location if you know.	Tun pẹlu bọtini ati ipo ti o ba mọ.
No body no one.	Ko si ara ko si ẹnikan.
You do not need to worry about bad weather.	O ko nilo lati ṣe aniyan nipa oju ojo daradara.
Behind him, the sun was about to set.	Lẹhin rẹ, oorun ti fẹrẹ wọ.
Women love that kind of thing.	Awọn obinrin nifẹ iru nkan bẹẹ.
How important that is to see.	Bawo ni iyẹn ti ṣe pataki to lati rii.
He wants you to just catch him.	O fe ki o kan mu u.
The boys didn’t notice it.	Awọn ọmọkunrin ko ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
So you should go.	Ki o yẹ ki o lọ.
Dad agreed.	Baba gba.
I would see a little boy go to school, come back from school.	Emi yoo rii ọmọ kekere ti o lọ si ile-iwe, pada wa lati ile-iwe.
Good with me either way.	O dara pẹlu mi boya ọna.
Just hope it doesn’t show up.	O kan nireti pe ko han.
Ask someone to come.	Beere fun ẹnikan lati wa.
Do not eat while drinking.	Maṣe jẹun nigba mimu.
Let's see, is there a town nearby?	Jẹ ki a wo, ṣe ilu kan wa nitosi?
Students expect to complete their assignments on time.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe nireti lati pari iṣẹ wọn ni akoko.
You will have to do some learning along the way.	Iwọ yoo ni lati ṣe diẹ ninu awọn ẹkọ ni ọna.
This will not happen.	Eyi kii yoo ṣe.
I take care of myself.	Mo tọju ara mi.
They believe.	Wọn gbagbọ.
May as well.	Le bi daradara.
This is a bad day for football.	Eyi jẹ ọjọ buburu fun bọọlu.
You are used to this.	O ti lo si eyi.
I haven’t talked to my hair yet.	Emi ko sọrọ si irun mi sibẹsibẹ.
Maybe another time.	Boya akoko miiran.
We are not back there.	A ko pada wa nibẹ.
Now we just have to hope for the best.	Bayi a kan ni lati nireti fun ohun ti o dara julọ.
I do not want to return them today.	Emi ko fẹ lati da wọn pada loni.
It takes a long time.	O gba akoko pipẹ.
That goes along with that.	Iyẹn n lọ pẹlu.
No one did.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe.
The moments are yours forever.	Awọn akoko ti o jẹ tirẹ lailai.
That’s the time to go live.	Iyẹn ni akoko ti o ti lọ lati gbe.
Bring up.	Tọju.
It is raining.	Ojo ti n ro.
She turned her eyes to the sun.	O yi oju rẹ si oorun.
I asked him if he was very interested with her.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ boya o nifẹ pupọ pẹlu rẹ.
He is calling me.	O n pe mi.
Just let it be as it is.	O kan jẹ ki o jẹ bi o ti jẹ.
Meals eaten with bread.	Ounjẹ ti a jẹ pẹlu akara.
I am tired.	O ti re mi.
I had no idea they were there.	Emi ko mọ pe wọn wa nibẹ.
They met for the first time.	Wọn pade fun igba akọkọ.
It’s not that he doesn’t work as hard as the woman.	Kii ṣe pe ko ṣiṣẹ lile bi obinrin naa.
And his father, came home.	Ati baba rẹ, wa ni ile.
This is my bed.	Eyi ni ibusun mi.
To people who have not yet tried to understand.	Si awọn eniyan ti a ko tii gbiyanju lati ni oye.
And an idea happened to me.	Ati pe ero kan ṣẹlẹ si mi.
This is a hard one.	Eyi jẹ ọkan lile.
Bad place for you to kill.	Ibi fun o pa.
No, he thought.	Rara, o ro.
I can leave.	Mo ti le kuro.
I am better now.	Mo ti dara ju bayi.
All you want during that time is to get back to you.	Gbogbo ohun ti o fẹ ni gbogbo akoko yẹn ni lati pada si ọdọ rẹ.
Other people come and sit.	Awọn eniyan miiran wa ati joko.
He used to last as long as he wanted.	O si lo lati gun bi o ti fẹ.
My friend, you say you know it.	Ọrẹ mi, o sọ pe o mọ ọ.
No need to now.	Ko nilo lati bayi.
To have your money.	Lati ni owo rẹ.
Mejeeji and pa.	Mejeeji le pa.
We will be getting married next year.	A yoo ṣe igbeyawo ni ọdun to nbọ.
It takes about 30 minutes.	O gba to bii ọgbọn iṣẹju.
But no one said anything.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ohunkohun.
This is the first past.	Eyi ni akọkọ ti o kọja.
The sister was great, she said.	Arabinrin naa jẹ nla, o sọ.
I am with you on that.	Mo wa pẹlu rẹ lori iyẹn.
He turned to his side and looked back.	O yipada si ẹgbẹ rẹ o si wo ẹhin.
But it already seems so.	Ṣugbọn o ti dabi bẹ tẹlẹ.
Why not, it is difficult to say.	Kini idi ti ko ṣe, o nira lati sọ.
John sorry.	John binu.
Front end.	Ipari iwaju.
I have so much for you today.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ nkan fun ọ loni.
Will be here.	Yoo wa nibi.
You have.	O ni.
She wondered about the family.	O ṣe iyalẹnu nipa idile.
They have a good reason.	Won ni idi ti o dara.
Now on to something good.	Bayi lori nkan ti o dara.
His mother, however, had other plans.	Iya rẹ, sibẹsibẹ, ni awọn eto miiran.
And that is a bad thing.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ ohun buburu.
I can go now, however, and leave you to sleep.	Mo le lọ ni bayi, sibẹsibẹ, ki o si fi ọ silẹ lati sun.
Let everything go.	Jẹ ki ohun gbogbo lọ.
Or, no, that's not true.	Tabi, rara, iyẹn ko tọ.
It slammed the door.	O yara ti ilẹkun.
People are walking.	Eniyan n rin.
I did not hear from you.	Emi ko gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
If that happens, we are done.	Ti iyẹn ba ṣẹlẹ, a ti pari.
They do not seem to be happy.	Wọn ko dabi ẹni pe inu wọn dun.
I do not hate.	Emi ko korira.
Your time is up.	Akoko rẹ ti kọja.
Still no information.	Ṣi ko si alaye.
She worried about it for a minute.	O ṣe aniyan rẹ fun iṣẹju kan.
No next week.	Ko si ọsẹ to nbọ.
We are happy with our new idea.	Inu wa dun pẹlu ero tuntun wa.
You lost the old man.	O padanu atijọ eniyan.
I have no problems with it at all.	Emi ko ni awọn iṣoro pẹlu rẹ rara.
There is no reason to hurry.	Ko si idi lati yara.
We would like to know.	A yoo fẹ lati mọ.
But the problem is that it doesn’t.	Ṣugbọn iṣoro naa ni pe o ko ṣe.
It comes from within.	O wa lati inu.
It is very important.	O ṣe pataki pupọ.
He talks a lot about it.	O sọrọ pupọ nipa rẹ.
This program is also available as a small child.	Eto yii tun wa bi ọmọde kekere.
This program is very good.	Eto yi dara pupọ.
Why will.	Kini idi ti yoo.
I started early and worked late.	Mo bẹrẹ ni kutukutu ati ṣiṣẹ pẹ.
They take their own lives.	Wọn gba igbesi aye ti ara wọn.
I am still that way.	Mo tun wa ni ọna yẹn.
One cannot hasten to the end on time.	Eniyan ko le yara si ipari lori akoko akoko.
It's not the story, it's the music.	Kii ṣe itan naa lo ṣe, orin ni.
And for him, what he has is everything.	Ati fun u, ohun ti o ni ni ohun gbogbo.
Tell me what you told me!	Sọ ohun ti o sọ fun mi!
So it was as well that we came back.	Nitorina o jẹ bi daradara pe a pada wa.
This is a man.	Eyi jẹ eniyan.
But it was also not enough.	Sugbon o tun je ko to.
Seriously, people think that way.	Mo ṣe pataki, eniyan ro ni ọna yẹn.
I do not want to see anything.	Nko fe ri nkankan.
I am in the right place.	Mo wa ni ibi ti o tọ.
At least, not for the better.	O kere ju, kii ṣe fun dara julọ.
Here is something to explain.	Eyi ni nkan lati ṣe alaye.
It begins to unravel.	O bẹrẹ lati yọ kuro.
Man cannot live for hours.	Eniyan ko le gbe fun wakati.
Clean the room, start now!	Mọ yara naa, bẹrẹ ni bayi!
Close the field.	Pa aaye naa.
Or just look for a drink.	Tabi o kan wa fun ohun mimu.
Everything, you know, is correct.	Ohun gbogbo, o mọ, ni o tọ.
We love women and they can see that.	A nifẹ awọn obinrin ati pe wọn le rii iyẹn.
I didn’t believe for a minute by the way.	Emi ko gbagbọ fun iṣẹju kan nipasẹ ọna.
It is not supposed to be good.	O ti ko yẹ lati wa ni dara.
Please tell us about any errors you find in our stories.	Jọwọ sọ fun wa nipa eyikeyi awọn aṣiṣe ti o rii ninu awọn itan wa.
I hope you say no.	Mo nireti pe o sọ rara.
I am happy with it.	Inu mi dun pẹlu rẹ.
That was a great test.	Idanwo nla niyẹn.
You will get out of it only what you put into it.	Iwọ yoo jade kuro ninu rẹ nikan ohun ti o fi sinu rẹ.
He grew stronger.	O dagba ni okun sii.
Everyone wants to make those songs.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ lati ṣe awọn orin yẹn.
Remember your work hours.	Ranti awọn wakati iṣẹ rẹ.
But most say nothing.	Ṣugbọn pupọ julọ ko sọ ohunkohun.
So why did you do that? 	Nitorina kilode ti o ṣe bẹ?
Just tell us when you want to travel.	Kan sọ fun wa nigba ti o fẹ lati rin irin-ajo.
asked the boy.	beere lọwọ ọmọkunrin naa.
It’s more important.	O ṣe pataki diẹ.
Their water is very, very frequent.	Omi wọn pupọ ati nigbagbogbo.
See if you see anything.	Wo boya o ri ohunkohun.
I'll tell you that.	Emi yoo sọ fun ọ pe.
In this situation the number of children will appear.	Ni ipo yii iye awọn ọmọ yoo han.
It is very easy to work with.	O rọrun pupọ lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
So enjoy.	Nitorina gbadun.
And yet, you can feel its power.	Ati sibẹsibẹ, o le lero agbara rẹ.
He will make the deal for you.	Oun yoo ṣe adehun naa fun ọ.
I will look for a job tomorrow, he said.	Emi yoo wa iṣẹ ni ọla, o sọ.
It says something about our group.	O sọ nkankan nipa ẹgbẹ wa.
I don't see anything else you can say.	Emi ko ri ohun miiran ti o le sọ.
Always be on time.	Nigbagbogbo wa ni akoko.
If you are, it will not be.	Ti o ba wa, kii yoo jẹ.
If you can try, great.	Ti o ba le gbiyanju, nla.
But this shook his head.	Sugbon eleyi mi ori re.
I think we have to do this together.	Mo ro pe a ni lati ṣe eyi papọ.
You have to be strong in what you do.	O ni lati ni agbara ninu ohun ti o.
This can happen to anyone, especially in this day and age.	Eyi le ṣẹlẹ si ẹnikẹni, paapaa ni ọjọ ati ọjọ ori.
There is something wrong.	Nkan kan wa.
Good to hear from you.	O dara lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
You have something in you that eats you.	O ni nkan ti o wa ninu rẹ ti o jẹ ọ.
But that would have changed in a few years.	Ṣugbọn eyi yoo ti yipada ni ọdun diẹ.
But that seems good to him now.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn dabi pe o dara fun u ni bayi.
He looked at the young man.	O wo ọdọ naa.
You have to get it back.	O ni lati gba pada.
Is there something special.	Se nkankan pataki wa.
I just do not know.	Mo kan ko mọ.
He has given her the ability to see.	O ti fun u ni agbara lati ri.
At first, it was impossible.	Ni akọkọ, ko ṣee ṣe.
Teachers and students should work together.	Awọn olukọ ati awọn ọmọ ile-iwe yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ papọ.
Let me forget the past.	Jẹ ki n jẹ ki o gbagbe ohun ti o ti kọja.
You want to know how it is done.	O fẹ lati mọ bi o ti ṣe.
The bus left the station yesterday.	Ọkọ naa kuro ni ibudo lana.
If someone is in trouble, help them.	Ti ẹnikan ba wa ninu wahala, ran wọn lọwọ.
Do not deprive this power.	Maṣe kọ agbara yii kuro.
We hope that the possible reward will be a little more.	A nireti pe ere ti o ṣeeṣe yoo jẹ kekere diẹ.
It was nice to see.	O je dara lati ri.
This is enough for the test.	Eyi to fun idanwo.
It is available for dinner.	O wa fun ounjẹ alẹ.
He was angry and it was time to know why.	O binu ati pe o to akoko lati mọ idi.
You don't like me.	O ko fẹ mi.
All for and received.	Gbogbo fun ati gba.
Don't tell me.	Maṣe sọ fun mi.
I laughed because he was such a big brother.	Mo rẹrin nitori pe o jẹ arakunrin nla bẹ.
He reached out to her.	O de ọdọ rẹ.
Cities depend on roads.	Awọn ilu da lori awọn ọna.
We only have ideas.	A ni awọn ero nikan.
The water is very hot here!	Omi naa gbona pupọ nibi!
The week will allow the work to be repeated every week.	Ọsẹ yoo jẹ ki iṣẹ naa tun ṣe ni gbogbo ọsẹ.
He did not intend for them to die.	O ko pinnu fun wọn lati ku.
Yesterday you want to be able to think, to plan.	Lana o fẹ ni anfani lati ronu, lati gbero.
He does not expect anything.	Ko nireti ohunkohun.
We do not know about tomorrow.	A ko mọ nipa ọla.
I have completed a lot.	Mo ti pari pupọ julọ.
But let’s not stop there.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki a ma duro nibẹ.
So, the same thing with water.	Nitorina, ohun kanna pẹlu omi.
Feeling that everything around you is good.	Rilara pe ohun gbogbo ti o wa ni ayika rẹ dara.
There is no way to tell them.	Ko si ọna lati sọ wọn.
Pick them up and give me one.	Gbe wọn soke ki o si fi ọkan fun mi.
I left both there.	Mo fi awọn mejeeji silẹ nibẹ.
For me it was a school of life.	Fun mi o jẹ ile-iwe ti igbesi aye.
It's too long.	O ti gun ju.
The fiber will become the inner fiber again.	Okun naa yoo di okun inu inu lẹẹkansi.
I will ask you for more details.	Emi yoo beere lọwọ rẹ fun awọn alaye diẹ.
It’s an amount that starts early.	O jẹ iye ti o bẹrẹ ni kutukutu.
Most people will have.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan yoo ni.
It will take them about three months.	Yoo gba wọn bii oṣu mẹta.
So this is cats, let’s get out of the bag.	Nitorina eyi ni ologbo, jẹ ki o jade kuro ninu apo naa.
I kept my mouth shut.	Mo pa ẹnu mọ́.
I became beautiful early on.	Mo ti di lẹwa ni kutukutu.
I love it so much, that it even makes me love everything.	Mo nifẹ rẹ bẹ, pe paapaa o jẹ ki mi nifẹ ohun gbogbo.
Everyone else is trying to figure it out.	Gbogbo eniyan miiran n gbiyanju lati ro ero rẹ.
You seem to know a lot about them.	O dabi pe o mọ pupọ nipa wọn.
But nothing like what is happening right now.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o dabi ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ ni bayi.
You should do this every day.	O yẹ ki o ṣe eyi ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Maybe that's all any of this is.	Boya ti o ni gbogbo eyikeyi ti yi ni.
Last year, they tried another meal.	Ni ọdun to kọja, wọn tun gbiyanju ounjẹ miiran.
My time away was well worth it.	Mi akoko kuro je daradara tọ o.
Boats like this are environmentally friendly.	Awọn ọkọ oju omi bii eyi jẹ ọrẹ ayika.
However, that will only happen if the right people are doing the job.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn nikan yoo ṣẹlẹ ti awọn eniyan ti o tọ ba n ṣe iṣẹ naa.
I don’t know what to do with questions like that.	Ko mọ kini lati ṣe pẹlu ibeere bii iyẹn.
We will always be here for you.	A yoo ma wa nibi fun ọ nigbagbogbo.
Not to sit and talk about that game all day.	Kii ṣe lati joko ati sọrọ nipa ere yẹn ni gbogbo ọjọ.
It could not be better.	Ko le ṣee dara.
See, maybe it is like this.	Wo, boya o jẹ bi eleyi.
Not a good one.	Ko kan ti o dara.
I thought it.	Mo ti ro o.
Everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong.	Ohun gbogbo ti o le ṣe aṣiṣe ti lọ ni aṣiṣe.
The future is not this way.	Ojo iwaju kii ṣe ọna yii.
I'm not done.	Mi o ti pari.
Good job if you can get it.	Iṣẹ to dara ti o ba le gba.
And it's good.	Ati pe o dara.
When bad times come, they are the first to be abandoned.	Nigbati awọn akoko buburu ba de, wọn jẹ akọkọ ti a fi silẹ.
I saw fire everywhere around me.	Mo ti ri ina nibi gbogbo ni ayika mi.
But there is nothing to be done for it.	Sugbon ko si nkankan lati ṣee ṣe fun o.
Calling us.	Ti n pe wa.
After two hours, my thoughts returned to my children.	Lẹhin awọn wakati meji, awọn ero mi pada si awọn ọmọ mi.
I should not have married her.	Emi ko yẹ ki o ti ni iyawo rẹ.
But he continues to ask questions.	Ṣugbọn o tẹsiwaju lati beere awọn ibeere.
You must have breakfast before your first lesson.	O gbọdọ jẹ ounjẹ owurọ ṣaaju ẹkọ akọkọ rẹ.
It was a great time indeed.	O jẹ akoko nla gaan.
Can not sell it.	Ko le ta a.
Of course it tested well.	Dajudaju o ṣe idanwo daradara.
That's good.	O dara iyẹn.
Not many, either.	Ko ọpọlọpọ, boya.
We will do anything of the kind.	A yoo ṣe ohunkohun ti iru.
It tells you how long you have been talking.	O sọ fun ọ bi o ti pẹ to ti o ti sọrọ.
The sister came back, she told us.	Arabinrin naa ti pada wa, o sọ fun wa.
No time to go out.	Ko si akoko lati jade.
Two, get help.	Meji, gba iranlọwọ.
As they are.	Bi wọn ti jẹ.
It's more than you can ask for.	O ju ohun ti o le beere lọ.
But this is not a school.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe ile-iwe.
You can not come.	O ko le wa.
He could not return.	Ko le pada.
I got my job away from me.	Mo ni iṣẹ mi kuro fun mi.
He refused to accept their decision.	O kọ lati gba ipinnu wọn.
He was not afraid.	O ko bẹru.
The minutes are gone.	Awọn iṣẹju ti lọ.
We will do our best to help you.	A yoo ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ lati ran ọ lọwọ.
It came through a friend’s friend.	O wa nipasẹ ọrẹ ọrẹ kan.
There is only one way on your own.	Ọna kan wa lori ara rẹ nikan.
We have to get out of here.	A ni lati gba kuro ni ibi.
But not much before they got here.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ ṣaaju ki wọn to de ibi.
We have no place to be but here.	A ko ni ibi lati wa sugbon nibi.
You have not asked.	O ti ko beere.
You can see this place.	O le wo ibi yii.
I decided it wouldn’t happen to me.	Mo pinnu pe kii yoo ṣẹlẹ si mi.
No one paid him any attention.	Ko si ọkan san rẹ eyikeyi akiyesi.
He was a good friend.	O jẹ ọrẹ to dara.
I do not have to read.	Emi ko ni lati ka.
He felt his life had moved from within.	O ro pe igbesi aye rẹ ti gbe lati inu.
I have kept this idea high for years.	Mo jẹ ki ero yii ga fun awọn ọdun.
I of the first word.	I ti ọrọ akọkọ.
That is everything.	Ohun gbogbo niyen.
I would kill myself if you did not do so.	Emi yoo pa ara mi ti o ko ba ṣe bẹ.
I just took that.	Mo kan mu iyẹn.
He raised his head.	O gbe ori rẹ.
I remember a life that no one knew.	Mo ranti igbesi aye ti ẹnikan ko mọ.
There is no time to lose.	Ko si akoko lati padanu.
And a lot of people do.	Ati ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan ṣe.
I have worked my purpose.	Mo ti ṣiṣẹ idi mi.
Everyone is using it.	Gbogbo eniyan lo n lo.
The trees need no more help.	Awọn igi ko nilo iranlọwọ diẹ sii.
I mean these are the first words that come out of my mouth.	Mo tumọ si pe awọn wọnyi ni awọn ọrọ akọkọ ti ẹnu mi jade.
Use them when you have time for them.	Lo wọn nigbati o ba ni akoko fun wọn.
But it paid him more than he deserved.	Ṣugbọn o ti san fun u diẹ sii ju ti o ti tọ si.
Okay, to tell you what happened to you.	O dara, lati sọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ fun ọ.
Everyone knows now.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ ni bayi.
That is not me.	Iyẹn kii ṣe emi.
It became a lot of work.	O di iṣẹ pupọ.
Here they are not.	Nibi ti won ko.
And they have touched you.	Ati pe wọn ti fi ọwọ kan ọ.
Okay, that didn't go away.	O dara, iyẹn ko lọ.
She held the baby against her.	O di ọmọ naa si i.
It’s not something we do.	Kii ṣe nkan ti a ṣe.
And you can understand this.	Ati pe o le ni oye eyi.
But you will not learn anything about personal life.	Ṣugbọn iwọ kii yoo kọ nkankan nipa igbesi aye ti ara ẹni.
The application is important to help us perform our functions.	Ohun elo naa ṣe pataki lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun wa lati ṣe awọn iṣẹ wa.
Nothing can stop us now.	Ko si ohun ti o le da wa duro ni bayi.
This will be a long night.	Eyi yoo jẹ alẹ pipẹ.
He doesn't like to drive.	Ko feran lati wakọ.
I'm not sure if this is even possible.	Emi ko ni idaniloju boya eyi ṣee ṣe paapaa.
You are in trouble.	O wa ni iṣoro.
he asked.	o beere.
It would be good to put all these ideas together.	Yoo dara julọ lati ko gbogbo awọn imọran wọnyi papọ.
It feels great today.	O ro nla loni.
If it starts to rain, we have to wait.	Ti ojo ba bẹrẹ, a ni lati duro.
The time has come for her husband.	Akoko ti dara fun ọkunrin rẹ.
To the boat.	Si ọkọ oju omi.
See the text for details.	Wo ọrọ naa fun awọn alaye.
That is not for me to say.	Iyẹn kii ṣe fun mi lati sọ.
That is the only reason.	Idi nikan niyen.
The important thing for me is to have books.	Ohun pataki fun mi ni lati ni awọn iwe.
That is what the truth is.	Iyẹn jẹ ohun ti otitọ jẹ.
I don’t have to wait for you.	Emi ko ni lati duro fun o.
You know, this thing will never die.	O mọ, nkan yii kii yoo ku.
It is hard to get so much attention.	O jẹ lile lati gba iru akiyesi pupọ bẹ.
I wanted to believe so.	Mo ti fẹ lati gbagbọ bẹ.
He is really trying to lift the tree.	O n gbiyanju gaan lati gbe igi soke.
I love this too.	Mo nifẹ eyi paapaa.
All they really needed was the boy.	Gbogbo ohun ti wọn nilo gan ni ọmọkunrin naa.
He will not be removed from that.	Ko ni kuro lati pe.
I'm sure.	Mo ti sọ daju.
You can say they are yours.	O le sọ pe wọn jẹ tirẹ.
The thought of hurrying to a chair.	Awọn ero ti yara si ijoko kan.
At our site, you can enjoy.	Ni aaye wa, o le wa gbadun.
This is the approach taken in this work.	Eyi ni ọna ti a mu ninu iṣẹ yii.
Some feared, of everything, but still now.	Diẹ ninu awọn bẹru, ti ohun gbogbo, sugbon si tun bayi.
Let him do what he wants.	Jẹ ki o ṣe ohun ti o fẹ.
Just let the man talk.	O kan jẹ ki ọkunrin naa sọrọ.
Brother in our room, please go.	Arakunrin ti o wa sinu yara wa, jọwọ lọ.
It was all very urban.	O je gbogbo gan ilu.
Maybe he took it well.	Boya o ti mu o daradara.
However, they have their own advantages.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn ni awọn anfani ti ara wọn.
I really don't believe it will happen.	Emi ko gbagbọ gaan pe yoo ṣẹlẹ.
It depends on that.	O duro lori iyẹn.
No need to say bad words.	Ko nilo lati sọ awọn ọrọ buburu.
They can just wait.	Wọn le kan duro.
He taught me many things.	O si kọ mi ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun.
When and where they will eat.	Nigbawo ati nibo ni wọn yoo jẹun.
For your own sake.	Fun idi ti ara rẹ.
You have to wake up early in the morning.	O ni lati ji ni kutukutu owurọ.
And nothing yet.	Ati pe ko si nkankan sibẹsibẹ.
He will find a way to contact me.	Oun yoo wa ọna lati kan si mi.
It's early in the morning.	O wa ni owurọ.
Some expect it.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti o reti o.
Lots, lots of stuff.	Ọpọlọpọ, ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
I have no idea what to expect.	Emi ko ni imọran kini lati reti.
I want to teach dogs.	Mo fẹ lati kọ awọn aja.
You have looked at it with interest.	O ti wo rẹ pẹlu anfani.
One of many.	Ọkan ninu ọpọlọpọ.
He ate with her.	O jẹun pẹlu rẹ.
I have the power.	Mo ni agbara.
We will not get into that.	A ko ni gba sinu iyẹn.
I need to get high.	Mo nilo lati ga.
Lots to read.	Pupọ lati ka.
I’m on my way to winning.	Mo wa lori ọna mi lati gba.
There was no love.	Nibẹ je ko si ife.
I want to give him a good, hard look.	Mo fẹ lati fun u kan ti o dara, lile wo.
We don't need it anymore.	A ko nilo rẹ mọ.
I can't even believe it.	Emi ko le gbagbọ paapaa.
There are no other buildings.	Ko si awọn ile miiran.
She looked around at the women in the room.	O wo ni ayika ni awọn obinrin ninu yara.
That is the nature of life.	Bi aye se ri niyen.
No one asked questions.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o beere ibeere.
No work required.	Ko si iṣẹ ti o nilo.
You’ve got a few words in the past.	O ti ni awọn ọrọ diẹ ni igba atijọ.
They all ended their careers in one football team.	Gbogbo wọn pari iṣẹ wọn ni ẹgbẹ bọọlu kan kan.
A ta wa.	A ta wa.
But not all of them are convinced that it helps.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe gbogbo wọn ni idaniloju pe o ṣe iranlọwọ.
Much has been done.	Pupọ diẹ ni a ti ṣe.
I think it becomes love.	Mo ro pe o di ifẹ.
I'll stay here, in the big room.	Emi yoo duro nibi, ninu yara nla.
Everyone turned to look.	Gbogbo eniyan yipada lati wo.
This is not heard.	Eyi ko gbọ.
He bought good food.	O ra ounjẹ to dara.
Maybe that's fine.	Boya iyẹn dara.
I'll get over it.	Emi yoo gba lori rẹ.
He said it was amazing.	O sọ pe o jẹ iyalẹnu.
She plans to open her own store.	O gbero lati ṣii ile itaja tirẹ.
It will be good for anyone tomorrow.	Yoo dara fun enikeni ni ọla.
You will not be able to go to it.	Iwọ kii yoo ni anfani lati lọ si ọdọ rẹ.
Let yourself feel.	Jẹ ki ara rẹ lero.
When you have that, you have a lot.	Nigbati o ba ni iyẹn, o ni pupọ.
Neither called.	Bẹni ko pe.
We will see you.	A yoo ri ọ.
I brought that to life through love.	Mo mu iyẹn wa si aye nipasẹ ifẹ.
He had met her before.	O ti pade rẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
But the picture.	Ṣugbọn aworan naa.
I have never been on one of them before.	Emi ko ti wa lori ọkan ninu wọn ṣaaju ki o to.
Move if you have to.	Gbe ti o ba ni.
When he looked, there was nowhere to be found.	Nigbati o wo, ko si ibi ti a ti ri.
And it worked.	Ati pe o ṣiṣẹ.
If you can change, it will. 	Ti o ba le yipada, yoo. 
They were not found.	Won ni won ko ri.
He always told me so.	O nigbagbogbo sọ fun mi bẹ.
And it did not end there.	Ati pe ko pari nibẹ.
I do not know why this is happening.	Emi ko mọ idi ti eyi fi n ṣẹlẹ.
Whatever it is.	Ohunkohun ti o wa.
At least, to ourselves.	O kere ju, si ara wa.
This would not be suitable for any high-performance projects.	Eyi kii yoo dara fun eyikeyi awọn iṣẹ ṣiṣe agbara giga.
They can not be too high.	Wọn ko le ga julọ.
You have already lost your job.	O ti padanu iṣẹ rẹ tẹlẹ.
We have bought ourselves some time.	A ti ra ara wa ni igba diẹ.
The box is made of metal.	Irin ni a fi ṣe apoti naa.
Make our future together.	Ṣe ọjọ iwaju wa papọ.
I know her well.	Mo ti mọ rẹ daradara.
I just like them with their teachers who know them.	Mo kan fẹ wọn pẹlu awọn olukọ wọn ti o mọ wọn.
My kids have to take it out of school.	Awọn ọmọ mi ni lati mu jade ni ile-iwe.
I will not let you eat with other boys today.	Emi kii yoo jẹ ki o jẹun pẹlu awọn ọmọkunrin miiran loni.
Okay, this let me out.	O dara, eyi jẹ ki n jade.
Our goal is to drive these routes.	Ipinnu wa ni lati wakọ awọn ọna wọnyi.
We do it for ourselves.	A ṣe fun ara wa.
Before we went public, they were doing everything.	Ṣaaju ki a to lọ si gbangba, wọn n ṣe ohun gbogbo.
In fact, when asked.	Ni otitọ, nigbati o ba beere.
Tomorrow is a long day.	Ọla jẹ ọjọ pipẹ.
It is my opinion.	O jẹ ero mi.
Not as it should be.	Kii ṣe bi o ti yẹ.
I want to be like her.	Mo fẹ lati dabi rẹ.
Places to visit on this planet.	Awọn aaye lati ṣabẹwo si lori aye yii.
I look down the road.	Mo wo isalẹ opopona.
The key is to make sure everyone can understand.	Awọn bọtini ni lati rii daju wipe gbogbo eniyan le ni oye.
I could see only the side of his face.	Mo le rii nikan ni ẹgbẹ ti oju rẹ.
Maybe because of it.	Boya nitori rẹ.
I'll wait and see what happens.	Emi yoo duro ati ki o wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
But nothing happened.	Sugbon ti ohunkohun ko ṣe.
Power is there.	Agbara wa nibẹ.
And it's worth it.	Ati pe o tọ.
He has a problem.	O ni iṣoro kan.
I have only one life to lose.	Mo ni nikan kan aye lati padanu.
He stole the book.	O ji iwe.
But it is nothing else.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe nkan miiran.
We have tried a couple of things.	A ti gbiyanju awọn nkan meji kan.
And that would be great.	Ati pe iyẹn yoo jẹ nla.
Okay, hear this.	O dara, gbọ eyi.
It was there across the road.	O wa nibẹ kọja opopona naa.
They already know that.	Wọn ti mọ pe.
I am two minutes away.	Mo wa iṣẹju meji.
Let me just say this.	Jẹ ki n kan sọ eyi.
Make a plan.	Ṣe eto kan.
I can run.	Mo le ṣiṣe.
The little brother did not believe in that.	Arakunrin kekere ko gbagbọ ninu iyẹn.
And the ending is one for history books.	Ati pe ipari naa jẹ ọkan fun awọn iwe itan.
And it probably isn’t.	Ati pe o ṣee ṣe kii ṣe.
There is a special price for good students.	Iye owo pataki kan wa fun awọn ọmọ ile-iwe to dara.
He did not speak until we were outside the house.	O ko sọrọ titi a fi wa ni ita ile naa.
Maybe not with us either.	Boya kii ṣe pẹlu wa paapaa.
And they will get it, he thought.	Won a si gba a, o ro.
I have dropped.	Mo ti lọ silẹ.
She did everything she could for the baby.	O ṣe gbogbo ohun ti o le fun ọmọ naa.
I have to break it.	Mo gbọdọ fọ o.
It makes everything easier.	O mu ki ohun gbogbo rọrun.
He said he did not enjoy the game.	O ni oun ko gbadun ere naa.
There are a lot of old people there.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan atijọ wa wa nibẹ.
Summer is over.	Ooru ti pari.
Please try the tea.	Jọwọ ṣe idanwo tii naa.
They are not afraid.	Wọn ko bẹru.
My marriage.	Igbeyawo mi.
He has left me many times.	O ti fi mi silẹ ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
You know your phone.	O mọ foonu rẹ.
I mean, never tried it.	Mo tumọ si, ko gbiyanju rẹ rara.
I do not expect that.	Emi ko nireti iyẹn.
Very good dinner, especially.	Ounjẹ alẹ ti o dara pupọ, paapaa.
Some of them laughed.	Diẹ ninu wọn rẹrin.
So you can be with him.	Nitorina o le wa pẹlu rẹ.
You have to try.	O ni lati gbiyanju.
I want it.	Mo fe e.
They watched for hours.	Wọn ti wo fun wakati.
It is ahead too.	O ti wa ni iwaju ju.
No one can move or look away.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o le gbe tabi wo kuro.
Neither did they.	Bẹni wọn ko ṣe.
The word has been made public.	Ọrọ naa ti sọ ni gbangba.
My time worked.	Akoko mi ṣiṣẹ.
It took a lot.	O mu pupọ.
Not everyone thinks this is a good idea.	Ko gbogbo eniyan ro pe eyi jẹ imọran to dara.
We were going to be married.	A ni won lilọ lati wa ni iyawo.
It's not.	Kii ṣe.
In other words, you always have to know your site.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, o nigbagbogbo ni lati mọ aaye rẹ.
I am asleep.	Mo ti sun.
I want them not to.	Mo fẹ ki wọn ko.
I am not angry about anything.	Emi ko binu nipa ohunkohun.
It is not possible to go on foot, but it will take time.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati lọ si ẹsẹ, ṣugbọn yoo gba akoko.
This work is very important to our work.	Iṣẹ yii ṣe pataki pupọ si iṣẹ wa.
This went on for well over a year.	Eleyi lọ lori fun daradara ju odun kan.
I can't even stand in front.	Emi ko le paapaa duro ni iwaju.
That same day.	Ti ọjọ kanna.
If you can call them dates.	Ti o ba le pe wọn ọjọ.
Stay away from there naturally.	Duro kuro nibẹ nipa ti.
We agree that this is possible.	A gba pe eyi ṣee ṣe.
I was only his mother's friend.	Mo jẹ ọrẹ iya rẹ nikan.
I told him that.	Mo sọ fun u pe.
There is only one way to find out.	Ọna kan nikan lati wa.
My flight will be on time.	Ọkọ ofurufu mi yoo wa ni akoko.
Everything is over now.	Gbogbo nkan ti pari ni bayi.
Can't remember how it was before.	Ko le ranti bi o ti ri tẹlẹ.
But, we have no songs.	Ṣugbọn, a ko ni awọn orin.
So give it now.	Nitorina fun ni bayi.
Please accept.	Jọwọ gba.
This has been done.	Eyi ti a ti ṣe.
What are you doing?	Ki lo de?
This alone is a great work.	Eyi nikan jẹ iṣẹ nla kan.
The sister severely damaged her car park.	Arabinrin naa ba ibudo ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ jẹ gidigidi.
Ask them questions.	Beere wọn ibeere.
At least not through them.	O kere kii ṣe nipasẹ wọn.
Now that is the way life should be.	Bayi iyẹn ni ọna igbesi aye yẹ ki o jẹ.
All we can do now is wait.	Gbogbo ohun ti a le ṣe ni bayi ni duro.
But he could not have this.	Ṣugbọn ko le ni eyi.
If he does not say anything, it is better to find something else to do.	Ti ko ba sọ nkankan, o dara julọ tun wa nkan lati ṣe.
He has no eyes afraid.	O ko ni oju bẹru.
It should be because you want to.	O yẹ ki o wa nitori pe o fẹ.
What is best for them and for themselves.	Kini o dara julọ fun wọn ati fun ara wọn.
I, in particular, like to travel by train when possible.	Emi, paapaa, fẹ lati rin irin-ajo nipasẹ ọkọ oju irin nigbati o ba ṣeeṣe.
However, marriage did not.	Sibẹsibẹ, igbeyawo ko ṣe.
There should not be any school today.	Ko yẹ ki o wa ile-iwe eyikeyi loni.
Has been for years.	Ti wa fun awọn ọdun.
You want to stay on the side.	O fẹ lati duro lori ẹgbẹ.
The man is serious.	Ọkunrin naa ṣe pataki.
You can not see.	O ko le wo.
If they try to do something they are bad people.	Ti wọn ba gbiyanju lati ṣe nkan wọn jẹ eniyan buburu.
For you, nothing could be more or less simple.	Fun ọ, ko si ohun ti o le jẹ diẹ sii tabi kere si rọrun.
All three groups received the same test.	Gbogbo awọn ẹgbẹ mẹta gba idanwo kanna.
By these girls.	Nipasẹ awọn ọmọbirin wọnyi.
He said he did not know why he did it.	O ni oun ko mo idi ti oun fi se e.
This is everyone's favorite vacation spot.	Eyi ni ibi isinmi ayanfẹ ti gbogbo eniyan.
This is especially true for seafood.	Eyi jẹ otitọ paapaa fun awọn ounjẹ okun.
Good for me, you know.	O dara fun mi, o mọ.
Think carefully about what you are going to do.	Ronu daradara nipa ohun ti iwọ yoo ṣe.
Try some of them.	Gbiyanju diẹ ninu wọn.
Sorry, you have.	Ma binu, o ni.
However there are still problems.	Sibẹsibẹ awọn iṣoro tun wa nibẹ.
We are all stopped.	Gbogbo wa ni a duro.
I am in the same predicament as my father.	Mo wa ninu wahala kanna bi baba mi.
Whatever you have done, you are determined to stay with it.	Ohunkohun ti o ti ṣe, o ti pinnu lati duro pẹlu rẹ.
Now, of course, at least as much as it is.	Bayi, dajudaju, o kere ju bi o ti jẹ lọ.
You agree.	O gba.
Not much to ask.	Ko ṣe pupọ lati beere.
He said nothing to them.	Ko so nkankan fun won.
But the desire to get up is gone.	Ṣugbọn ifẹ lati dide ti lọ.
You want to be the best friend ever.	O fẹ lati jẹ ọrẹ to dara julọ lailai.
I was completely out of thought at this point.	Mo patapata jade ti ero ni aaye yi.
I went to find him and hit him with a seat.	Mo lọ lati wa ninu rẹ ati ki o lu u pẹlu ijoko kan.
That’s the kind of thing that brings families back together again.	Iyẹn ni iru ohun ti o mu awọn idile pada papọ lẹẹkansi.
And it is not easy.	Ati pe ko rọrun.
I can not explain why.	Nko le se alaye idi.
he asked.	o beere.
I could not wait to get out of his sight.	Emi ko le duro lati lọ kuro ni oju rẹ.
In other words, he is himself.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, o jẹ ara rẹ.
Everyone knows what you need to do.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe.
I am too small for him.	Mo kere ju fun u.
However, it did not work as expected.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko ṣiṣẹ bi o ti ṣe yẹ.
I saw into it in the past.	Mo ri sinu rẹ ti o ti kọja.
Not to come across here and now.	Ko wa lati lọ kọja ibi ati ni bayi.
But it can not.	Sugbon ko le.
I do not know what to do with it now.	Emi ko mọ kini lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ ni bayi.
By setting.	Nipa eto.
There are many, but not all, of these ideas.	Pupọ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe gbogbo rẹ, ti awọn ero wọnyi nigbagbogbo wa.
Things you never thought about that won you over.	Awọn ohun ti o ko ronu nipa ti o gba ọ.
He said he would probably never see me again.	O ni boya ko ni ri mi mo.
This may be the last water that will come.	Eyi le jẹ omi ti o kẹhin ti yoo wa.
He still felt hard.	O si tun ro lile.
Sure, they can stay a few more days.	Daju, wọn le duro ni awọn ọjọ diẹ diẹ sii.
Go here to contact the doctor.	Lọ si ibi lati kan si dokita.
Water should be available in all conditions.	Omi yẹ ni gbogbo awọn ipo.
I look forward to hearing what you have to say.	Mo n reti lati gbọ ohun ti o ni lati sọ.
Today it belongs to the world.	Loni o jẹ ti aye.
Just seeing the story.	O kan n rii itan naa.

With another teacher.	Pẹlu olukọ miiran.

You are not allowed to stay here.	O ko gba ọ laaye lati duro si ibi.
She is very scared.	O bẹru pupọ.
It cannot be reproduced.	A ko le gbe e jade.
However, her daughter is meeting.	Sibẹsibẹ, ọmọbirin rẹ ti wa ni ipade.
Our love is not wrong.	Ifẹ wa ko ṣe aṣiṣe.

They love to say this.	Wọn nifẹ lati sọ eyi.
Please wash these foods before you go.	Jọwọ wẹ awọn ounjẹ wọnyi ṣaaju ki o to lọ.
You have to get up.	O ni lati dide.
Great in bed.	Nla ni ibusun.
The program is not finished yet.	Eto naa ko ti pari sibẹsibẹ.
Only, it seems like it takes forever to grow.	Nikan, o dabi pe o gba lailai lati dagba.
We want them to love us.	A fẹ wọn lati fẹ wa.
It all came down to expectations.	Gbogbo rẹ wa si isalẹ lati nireti.
But he did not move.	Sugbon ko gbe.
How much can you add.	Elo ni o le fi kun.
He looked at the house.	O wo ile naa.
Just try to help.	O kan gbiyanju lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
That kills people.	Ti o gba eniyan pa.
I took it, and thought of the test.	Mo mu, mo si ronu idanwo naa.
The streets are full of people.	Awọn opopona ti kun fun eniyan.
He does not know them.	Ko mọ wọn.
I always think in music.	Mo nigbagbogbo ronu ninu orin.
So there is nothing in it.	Nitorina ko si nkan ti o wa ninu rẹ.
This does not include airplanes.	Eyi ko pẹlu awọn ọkọ ofurufu.
Some things really do get better with age.	Diẹ ninu awọn ohun gan ma dara pẹlu ọjọ ori.
The story unites.	Itan naa di papọ.
Just leave it as it is.	O kan fi silẹ bi o ṣe jẹ.
Of course you could not wish for him.	Dajudaju o ko le ṣe fẹ fun u.
He has been on the train.	O ti wa lori ọkọ oju irin.
I sit here.	Mo joko nibi.
Forget what they told you at school.	Gbagbe ohun ti wọn sọ fun ọ ni ile-iwe.
This is always true but not always.	Eyi jẹ otitọ nigbagbogbo ṣugbọn kii ṣe nigbagbogbo.
The game must have almost ended.	Ere naa gbọdọ ti fẹrẹ pari.
This will be problematic.	Eyi yoo jẹ iṣoro.
I should be included.	Emi ni o yẹ ki o wa pẹlu.
He’s playing a lot of games.	O n ṣe ere pupọ julọ.
However, these are just coming.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn wọnyi kan nbọ.
This book is his life story.	Iwe yii jẹ itan igbesi aye rẹ.
This is a new way of doing things.	Eyi jẹ ọna tuntun ti ṣiṣe awọn nkan.
I could be down with something.	Mo le wa ni isalẹ pẹlu nkankan.
There is also time on your side.	Akoko tun wa ni ẹgbẹ rẹ.
If you want to get married, well.	Ti o ba fẹ lati ṣe igbeyawo, daradara.
He spoke for a long time.	O sọrọ fun igba pipẹ.
It was time for me to go along.	O to akoko fun mi lati lọ pẹlu.
I can take a week off and tell you about them.	Mo le gba isinmi ọsẹ kan ati sọ fun ọ nipa wọn.
Most people do not know that.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ko mọ iyẹn.
What you know you can not explain, but if you feel it.	Ohun ti o mọ o ko ba le se alaye, ṣugbọn ti o ba lero o.
This can break the thing.	Eyi le fọ nkan naa.
None of us knew what to do about it.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa ti o mọ kini lati ṣe nipa rẹ.
What you do is.	Ohun ti o ṣe ni.
Class does nothing.	Kilasi ṣe ohunkohun.
You can sell it to someone who likes it.	O le ta fun ẹniti o fẹran rẹ.
The word means "at the appointed time."	Ọrọ naa tumọ si "ni akoko ti a ṣe akiyesi."
Just get through it.	Kan gba nipasẹ rẹ.
I do not know what happened.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
But you need to.	Ṣugbọn o nilo.
Board member.	Ẹgbẹ ọkọ.
Nor should that come as a surprise.	Tabi ko yẹ ki iyẹn wa bi iyalẹnu.
The doctor said she was fine.	Dokita sọ pe ara rẹ dara.
And what is it.	Ati pe kini o jẹ.
His face was clean for a minute.	Oju rẹ mọ fun iṣẹju kan.
Leave the city and.	Lọ kuro ni ilu ati.

Good thing.	Nkan to dara.
It's worth it to me.	O tọ si mi.
Advice to restructure the company.	Imọran lati tun ile-iṣẹ naa ṣe.
And in some respects, that’s true.	Ati ni awọn aaye diẹ, iyẹn jẹ otitọ.
He looked at the sea.	O wo okun.
No one needs money like that.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o nilo owo bi iyẹn.
You never know what to say.	O ko mọ ohun ti yoo sọ.
Look, they say.	Wo, wọn sọ.
We know that of course.	A mọ pe dajudaju.
You need warm clothes.	O nilo awọn aṣọ ti o gbona.
He moved.	O si gbe.
And there is no other way out of it.	Ati pe ko si ọna miiran lati inu rẹ.
Why would you consider anything else.	Kini idi ti iwọ yoo ro ohunkohun miiran.
You are not like me.	Iwọ ko dabi emi.
So many small shops.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ awọn ile itaja kekere.
Many think these are irrelevant, many think they do.	Ọpọlọpọ ro pe awọn wọnyi ko ṣe pataki, ọpọlọpọ ro pe wọn ṣe.
But things are not so simple.	Sugbon ohun ni o wa ko ki o rọrun.
The more you know, the easier it will become.	Bi o ṣe mọ diẹ sii, rọrun yoo di.
And everyone will always carry it on me.	Ati gbogbo eniyan yoo ma gbe e lori mi nigbagbogbo.
There are.	Nibẹ ni o wa.
So, talk to your parents.	Nitorina, sọrọ si awọn obi rẹ.
But he could not bring himself to do it.	Ṣugbọn ko le mu ara rẹ lati ṣe.
Some have both.	Diẹ ninu awọn ni awọn mejeeji.
There are still questions.	Awọn ibeere ṣi wa.
I don’t want to live without it.	Emi ko fẹ lati gbe laisi rẹ.
First, we are true to our plan.	Ni akọkọ, a jẹ otitọ si eto wa.
I have a road name like sea.	Mo ni orukọ ọna kan bi okun.
Application is given.	Ohun elo ni a fun.
I will not board that plane.	Emi ko ni ba ọkọ ofurufu yẹn.
If education seems like it, please let there be trouble.	Ti ẹkọ ba dabi, jọwọ jẹ ki wahala wa.
Work is complete on the project.	Iṣẹ ti pari lori iṣẹ naa.
But it was not.	Sugbon o je ko.
He is not in that position.	Ko si ni ipo yẹn.
I would say we will end by.	Emi yoo sọ pe a yoo pari nipasẹ .
Which misses on.	Eyi ti o padanu lori rẹ.
The fields go down.	Awọn aaye lọ si isalẹ.
Water is essential for life.	Omi jẹ pataki fun igbesi aye.
It is a beautiful picture.	Aworan ti o lẹwa ni.
So it is everything.	Nitorina o jẹ ohun gbogbo.
We will not have a small tea party like this.	A kii yoo ni ayẹyẹ tii kekere kan bii eyi.
There is nothing human like.	Ko si ohun ti o dabi eniyan.
I have a serious test.	Mo ni idanwo pataki kan.
No one will pass this way.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo kọja ni ọna yii.
I look out of it.	Mo wo jade ninu rẹ.
Hands die from cold.	Ọwọ ti ku lati otutu.
I think it must be time for them.	Mo ro pe o gbọdọ jẹ akoko fun wọn.
But not nearly enough.	Ṣugbọn ko fẹrẹ to dara.
I’m seeing that myself these days.	Mo n rii iyẹn funrararẹ ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
You have to keep them and watch them.	O gbọdọ tọju wọn ati ki o wo wọn.
Someone wants to make you look bad.	Ẹnikan fẹ lati jẹ ki o dabi ẹni buburu.
I'll just stick to them.	Emi yoo kan duro lori wọn.
Some things you tell them they accept, some they don’t.	Diẹ ninu ohun ti o sọ fun wọn pe wọn gba, diẹ ninu kii ṣe.
You raised my hand there.	Iwọ ni o fa ọwọ mi soke nibẹ.
We need more.	A nilo diẹ sii.
Nor does it explain who he is.	Tabi ko ṣe alaye ẹniti o jẹ.
He did not use any force found.	Ko lo eyikeyi agbara ti a ri.
And he is wise.	O si jẹ ọgbọn.
Stay out of my sight.	Duro kuro ni oju mi.
You have to do something.	O yẹ ki o ṣe nkan kan.
How we interpret what we see is another matter.	Bawo ni a ṣe tumọ ohun ti a rii jẹ ọrọ miiran.
He didn’t want to miss me like he missed my mother.	Ko fẹ lati padanu mi bi o ṣe padanu iya mi.
You and the group have to get up.	Iwọ pẹlu ẹgbẹ ni lati dide.
He sat back on his chair.	O joko pada lori ijoko rẹ.
This is about us, especially.	Eyi jẹ nipa wa, paapaa.
The more information a person has, the less they think.	Alaye diẹ sii ti eniyan ni, diẹ ni wọn ronu.
I'm happy, really.	Mo dun, ni otitọ.
You can't believe what you're saying, he said.	O ko le gbagbọ ohun ti o n sọ, o sọ.
Not from any of them.	Ko lati eyikeyi ninu wọn.
The weather is very hot this summer.	Oju ojo ti gbona pupọ ni igba ooru yii.
He tells us.	O sọ fun wa.
It's a school program.	Eto ile-iwe ni.
Give you something else to think about.	Fun ọ ni nkan miiran lati ronu nipa.
Almost everyone.	O fẹrẹ jẹ gbogbo eniyan.
They deserve to know what’s going on.	Wọn yẹ lati mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
We know it will not be easy.	A mọ pe kii yoo rọrun.
Not a good time.	Ko kan ti o dara akoko.
He did not meet her face but left her hand there.	O ko pade oju rẹ ṣugbọn o fi ọwọ rẹ silẹ nibẹ.
And it almost won.	Ati pe o fẹrẹ gba.
However this does not mean that you should not see.	Sibẹsibẹ eyi ko tumọ si pe o ko yẹ ki o rii.
The groom has the groom carry his box.	Ọkọ iyawo ni ki ọkọ iyawo gbe apoti rẹ.
The bad and the good.	Awọn buburu ati awọn ti o dara.
It will give me time to renew my strength.	Yoo fun mi ni akoko lati tun agbara mi ṣe.
You have to be able to look through it.	O ni lati ni anfani lati wo nipasẹ rẹ.
There is nothing left in that old house.	Ko si ohun ti o ku ninu ile atijọ yẹn.
You should know better than that.	O yẹ ki o mọ daradara ju iyẹn lọ.
But in reality nothing could be further from the truth.	Ṣugbọn ni otitọ ko si ohun ti o le jẹ diẹ sii lati otitọ.
In fact, he could not feel anything.	Ni otitọ, ko le lero nkankan.
He did not stand around.	Ko duro ni ayika.
So they won.	Nitorina wọn gba.
However, this is not an agreement.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi kii ṣe adehun.
Travel now back to yourself.	Irin-ajo bayi pada si ara rẹ.
The present is back.	Awọn bayi ti pada.
I think it's good.	Mo ro pe o dara.
You'll have to wait.	O ni lati duro.
If you see him again, remember me for him.	Ti o ba tun ri i, ranti mi fun u.
I’m not sure how important it is.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bi o ṣe ṣe pataki diẹ sii.
Get in your car and go to work.	Wọ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ ki o lọ si iṣẹ.
We should read a lot, so that we can know more.	A yẹ ki o ka pupọ, ki a le mọ pupọ.
Some others are known.	Diẹ ninu awọn miiran ni a mọ.
And we have work to do.	Ati pe a ni iṣẹ lati ṣe.
I was already good.	Mo ti dara tẹlẹ.
And not just one, many.	Ati pe kii ṣe ọkan nikan, ọpọlọpọ.
To hear you talk about it this way.	Lati gbọ ti o sọrọ nipa rẹ ni ọna yii.
I tried to get it done.	Mo gbiyanju lati gba bi o ti ṣe.
He knew.	O si mọ.
He did anything and everything he asked of him.	O ṣe ohunkohun ati ohun gbogbo ti o beere lọwọ rẹ.
Good for me and my children.	O dara fun emi ati awọn ọmọ mi.
However, it is worth it.	Sibẹsibẹ, o tọ si.
The dog refuses to leave the garden.	Aja kọ lati lọ kuro ni ọgba.
No one is so beautiful.	Ko si eniyan ti o lẹwa to bẹ.
Same for the other way around.	Kanna fun ọna miiran.
This is the problem.	Eyi ni iṣoro naa.
Which world?	Aye wo?
His whole body moved.	Gbogbo ara re gbe.
Not there.	Ko si nibẹ.
It is raining today.	Ojo gbona loni.
We packed our bags, we left everything.	A ko awọn apo wa, a fi ohun gbogbo silẹ.
Talk and talk.	Ọrọ ati sọrọ.
And that was my mistake.	Ati pe iyẹn ni aṣiṣe mi.
They worry about your life.	Wọn ṣe aniyan fun igbesi aye rẹ.
Maybe they can help.	Boya wọn le ṣe iranlọwọ.
I really like your sound.	Mo feran ohun re gaan.
Love another.	Ni ife miiran.
Your family needs a lot of help right now.	Idile rẹ nilo iranlọwọ pupọ ni bayi.
It should make the path more visible.	O yẹ ki o jẹ ki ọna naa han diẹ sii.
But he made love with such an opportunity.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe ifẹ pẹlu iru anfani bẹẹ.
You want to catch him.	O fẹ mu u.
Well, let, let.	Daradara, jẹ ki, jẹ ki.
I am in a bad way.	Mo wa ni ọna buburu.
It seems like you started the project.	Ṣe o dabi ẹni pe o bẹrẹ iṣẹ naa.
They will always look at me.	Wọn yoo ma wo mi.
It's a great game.	Ere nla ni.
It is more important to me not to understand.	O ṣe pataki diẹ sii fun mi lati ma loye.
Children and families visit this site.	Awọn ọmọde ati awọn idile ṣabẹwo si aaye yii.
He could not open the door.	Ko le ṣi ilẹkun.
I promise to bring back a lot of pictures.	Mo ṣe ileri lati mu ọpọlọpọ awọn aworan pada.
Write it down for yourself.	Kọ silẹ fun ara rẹ.
Remember that cat?	Ranti ologbo yẹn?
You will love it.	Iwọ yoo fẹran rẹ.
The days of sitting in class are long.	Awọn ọjọ ti o joko ni kilasi jẹ pipẹ.
It will make you look and feel better.	Yoo jẹ ki o wo ati ki o lero dara julọ.
There can be no other.	Ko le si miiran.
One of a kind.	Ọkan ninu awọn iru.
I can feel your love for me.	Mo le lero ifẹ rẹ si mi.
However he knew he should be kept at home.	Sibẹsibẹ o mọ pe o yẹ ki o tọju ni ile.
However, in his way.	Sibẹsibẹ, ni ọna rẹ.
Very good for him.	O dara pupọ fun u.
I remember feeling very happy.	Mo ranti pe inu mi dun pupọ.
So he continued.	Nitorina o tẹsiwaju.
It doesn't cost much.	Ko ni owo pupọ.
They are not fast.	Wọn ko yara.
Join me for details.	Da mi si awọn alaye.
If you need more time, get it.	Ti o ba nilo akoko diẹ sii, gba.
I have to work.	Mo ni lati ṣiṣẹ.
A little angry man.	A binu kekere eniyan.
There is also the place.	Ibi naa tun wa.
Only a few companies get to do that in a year.	Awọn ile-iṣẹ diẹ diẹ ni o gba lati ṣe iyẹn ni ọdun kan.
I showed him my school.	Mo fi ile-iwe mi han fun u.
I am trying to find another job.	Mo n gbiyanju lati wa ise miiran.
You are right in all your decisions.	O tọ ni gbogbo awọn ipinnu rẹ.
It's a big car.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ nla ni.
Iron door of tea.	Ilẹkun irin ti tii.
Class is small.	Kilasi jẹ kekere.
He is my brother.	Arakunrin mi ni.
Again, nothing special.	Lẹẹkansi, ko si nkan pataki.
The sun rises in the morning and sets in at night.	Oorun yọ ni owurọ o si wọ ni alẹ.
You don’t even know it.	O ko paapaa mọ ọ.
That is not a mistake.	Iyẹn ko jẹ aṣiṣe.
You have what it takes.	O ni ohun ti o fẹ.
I just feel.	Mo kan lero.
It has been very good for me.	O ti dara pupọ fun mi.
Now, of course he would say that.	Bayi, dajudaju oun yoo sọ iyẹn.
He is not angry.	O ko binu.
Please get what you need.	Jọwọ gba ohun ti o nilo.
I will never sit through that again.	Emi kii yoo joko nipasẹ iyẹn lẹẹkansi.
None of this statement makes sense.	Ko si ọkan ninu ọrọ yii ti o ni oye.
The game will also go to field money.	Awọn ere yoo tun lọ si owo ile aaye.
Feel it, feel what you’re doing.	Rilara rẹ, lero ohun ti o n ṣe.
As you live.	Bi o ti n gbe.
We have our future and it is in our hands.	A ni ojo iwaju wa ati pe o wa ni ọwọ wa.
Today we leave three.	Loni a fi mẹta silẹ.
But this place changed my mind about that.	Ṣugbọn ibi yii yi ọkan mi pada nipa iyẹn.
The car is gone.	Ọkọ naa ti lọ.
To say what you have to say.	Lati sọ ohun ti o ni lati sọ.
It looks like a small office.	O dabi ọfiisi kekere kan.
I would like to ask three questions.	Emi yoo beere awọn ibeere mẹta.
Agree with it.	Gba pẹlu rẹ.
To read a book we will need a couple of days.	Lati ka iwe kan a yoo nilo ọjọ meji kan.
Try to understand the problem.	Gbiyanju lati ni oye iṣoro naa.
It just is.	O kan ni.
You don’t have to take it outside.	O ko ni lati ya si ita.
But remember to warm up.	Ṣugbọn ranti lati gbona.
She had closed her eyes, and it was very sweet.	O ti pa oju rẹ mọ, o si dun pupọ.
But it is everywhere.	Sugbon o wa nibi gbogbo.
I will do very well, right now.	Emi yoo ṣe daradara pupọ, ni bayi.
I want it to be nice but simple.	Mo fẹ ki o dara ṣugbọn o rọrun.
The girls are there.	Awọn ọmọbirin wa nibẹ.
I hope you can do it.	Mo nireti pe o le ṣe.
Until you almost need them.	Titi di igba ti o fẹrẹ nilo wọn.
Why did this happen?	Kini idi ti eyi fi ṣẹlẹ.
I think he was the person that everyone looked up to.	Mo ro pe o wà ni eniyan ti gbogbo eniyan wo soke si.
The first rule includes a promise.	Ofin akọkọ pẹlu ileri kan.
My uncle is a doctor.	Arakunrin baba mi jẹ dokita kan.
But his motives are good.	Ṣugbọn awọn idi rẹ dara.
In fact he knew nothing.	Ni otitọ ko mọ nkankan.
So you can go.	Nitorina o le lọ.
I sold it.	Mo ta o.
If we are as broken.	Ti a ba wa ni bi a ti fọ.
I'm telling a truth.	Mo sọ otitọ kan.
All over everything.	Gbogbo lori ohun gbogbo.
It is not a life of hope.	Kii ṣe igbesi aye ti o nireti.
This can be even higher.	Eyi le paapaa ga ju iyẹn lọ.
It has changed through the streets.	O ti yipada nipasẹ awọn ọna ita.
If you have the space to do so you should.	Ti o ba ni aye lati ṣe bẹ o yẹ.
You have won.	O ti gba.
That will have to change.	Iyẹn yoo ni lati yipada.
Just try to do the right thing.	O kan gbiyanju lati ṣe ohun ti o tọ.
Her body is not very good.	Ara rẹ ko dara pupọ.
There is at least.	Nibẹ ni o kere ju.
Not that, either.	Kii ṣe iyẹn, boya.
Sit in that office that last day.	Joko ni ọfiisi yẹn ni ọjọ ikẹhin yẹn.
Our team made no mistake.	Ẹgbẹ wa ko ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
Find slaves.	Wa bayi.
Best to book a table.	Ti o dara ju lati iwe kan tabili.
We need to store water.	A nilo lati tọju omi.
Next year, no.	Ni ọdun to nbọ, ko si.
Education is more than information.	Ẹkọ jẹ diẹ sii ju alaye lọ.
The girl did not have to leave the house.	Ọmọbirin naa ko ni lati lọ kuro ni ile naa.
I think you will love it.	Mo ro pe iwọ yoo nifẹ rẹ.
Just my son again.	O kan ọmọ mi lẹẹkansi.
Either way, you know me.	Ọna boya, o mọ mi.
And he was with me.	Ati pe o wa pẹlu mi.
I paid.	Mo ti san owo.
After walking, you can use a drink.	Lẹhin ti o rin, o le lo ohun mimu.
He felt like a child.	O ro bi ọmọde.
Time period.	Akoko akoko.
Which, of course, happened.	Eyi ti, dajudaju, ṣẹlẹ.
We had a good time doing it.	A ni akoko ti o dara lati ṣe.
I live.	Mo n gbe.
He did not call his mother or me.	Ko pe iya rẹ tabi emi.
They said the boy would be a boy.	Wọn sọ pe ọmọ naa yoo jẹ ọmọkunrin.
You are wrong.	O ko tọ si.
It’s not just about the team.	Kii ṣe nipa ẹgbẹ nikan.
All spent the day.	Gbogbo lo ọjọ naa.
He seemed to pull himself together.	O dabi enipe o fa ara rẹ papọ.
I should know that you would think so.	Mo yẹ ki o mọ pe iwọ yoo ro bẹ.
I just went for the book.	Mo kan lọ fun inu iwe naa.
He called my desk space.	O pe aaye tabili mi.
I do not need to get up more.	Emi ko nilo lati dide diẹ sii.
He started talking around her, you know.	O bẹrẹ sọrọ ni ayika rẹ, o mọ.
They do not ask you about the past or yourself.	Wọn ko beere lọwọ rẹ nipa ohun ti o ti kọja tabi ara rẹ.
Maybe from some of the old clothes of the person you want to reach.	Boya lati diẹ ninu awọn aṣọ atijọ ti eniyan ti o fẹ lati de ọdọ.
I will not try to let anything happen.	Emi kii yoo gbiyanju lati jẹ ki ohunkohun ṣẹlẹ.
Not surprisingly.	Kii ṣe iyalẹnu.
Those who are here are here.	Awọn ti o wa nibi ni o wa nibi.
I can't wait to see everything.	Emi ko le duro lati ri ohun gbogbo.
We think the rest will be better.	A ro pe isinmi yoo dara julọ.
The room has changed.	Yara naa ti yipada.
Prices to high.	Iye owo si giga.
How not to.	Bi ko ṣe ṣe.
So many things could have gone wrong.	Ki ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun le ti lọ ti ko tọ.
I hope they will become your friends.	Mo nireti pe wọn yoo di ọrẹ rẹ.
The price is not over, of course.	Owo naa ko kọja, dajudaju.
If not, say so.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, sọ bẹ.
We could have gone with it.	A le ti lọ pẹlu rẹ.
At that time we were in love.	Ni akoko yẹn a wa ninu ifẹ.
And it may not be the other way for you.	Ati pe ko le jẹ ọna miiran fun ọ.
I totally agree with him.	Mo gba pẹlu rẹ patapata.
Roads are full after heavy rains.	Awọn opopona ti kun lẹhin ti ojo nla.
You should have been able to help.	O yẹ ki o ti ni anfani lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
Put what you think you know about working out.	Fi ohun ti o ro pe o mọ nipa ṣiṣẹ jade.
Not me.	Kii ṣe mi.
I have to be outside the city.	Mo ni lati wa ni ita ilu.
And many higher than them.	Ati ọpọlọpọ awọn ti o ga ju wọn lọ.
The little boy knew he was scared.	Ọmọkunrin kekere naa mọ pe o bẹru.
To be with him.	Lati wa pẹlu rẹ.
I mean, he was my dad.	Mo tumọ si, o jẹ baba mi.
But the decision is yours.	Ṣugbọn ipinnu jẹ tirẹ.
We don’t have to say more than that.	A ko ni lati sọ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
It may be your favorite thing, ever.	O le jẹ ohun ayanfẹ rẹ, lailai.
He has no sleep.	Ko ni oorun kankan.
Hurry or we will miss the bus!	Yara tabi a yoo padanu akero!
I will also learn, maybe what you can.	Emi yoo tun kọ ẹkọ, boya kini o le.
Times and things have changed.	Awọn akoko ati awọn nkan ti yipada.
They often cause more harm than good.	Nigbagbogbo wọn fa ipalara diẹ sii ju ti o dara lọ.
But it did not help them.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe iranlọwọ fun wọn.
Take a break to run today.	Ya isinmi lati ṣiṣe loni.
I will also give it to you, my friend.	Emi yoo tun fun ọ, ọrẹ mi.
They and my parents did not know about it.	Awọn ati awọn obi mi ko mọ nipa rẹ.
Not this !.	Kii ṣe eyi!.
And they won’t let you sleep.	Ati pe wọn kii yoo jẹ ki o sun.
I think this could be the problem.	Mo ro pe eyi le jẹ iṣoro naa.
We have learned that lesson.	A ti kọ ẹkọ yẹn.
Or at least that’s what you’re saying to yourself.	Tabi o kere ju iyẹn ni ohun ti o n sọ fun ararẹ.
Demand for fire continues to rise.	Ibeere fun ina ti tẹsiwaju lati dide.
They must be empowered and work through your power.	Wọn gbọdọ ni agbara ati ṣiṣẹ nipasẹ agbara rẹ.
Cord! 	Okun!
It may be the only life you will get in this.	O le jẹ aye nikan ti iwọ yoo gba ni eyi.
.	.
Many say it is good.	Ọpọlọpọ sọ pe o dara julọ.
You have already done this.	O ti ṣe eyi tẹlẹ.
I see him as a husband and as a friend.	Mo ri i bi ọkọ ati bi ọrẹ kan.
I said that.	Mo ti so wipe.
I think your idea is just yours.	Mo ro pe ero rẹ jẹ tirẹ nikan.
Now it continues.	Bayi o tẹsiwaju.
But that does not stop them from using legal means as well.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko da wọn duro lati lo awọn ọna ofin bi daradara.
How about it ?.	Bawo ni nipa rẹ?.
He left his head.	O fi ori rẹ silẹ.
It's too sweet.	O dun pupọ.
You will find a new man.	Iwọ yoo pada wa ọkunrin tuntun.
The work went well.	Iṣẹ naa lọ daradara.
He helped the team, you know.	O ran ẹgbẹ naa, o mọ.
Wait, he said.	Duro, o sọ.
You should turn around and run back to your rooms.	O yẹ ki o yipada ki o si sare pada si awọn yara rẹ.
You should have one.	O yẹ ki o ni ọkan.
He is asking questions by phone.	O n beere awọn ibeere nipa foonu.
I hope you see everything.	Mo nireti pe o wo ohun gbogbo.
I do not know what to do from here.	Emi ko mọ kini lati ṣe lati ibi.
But what if I am spiritual.	Ṣugbọn kini ti o ba jẹ emi.
Your help is available as soon as we need it.	Iranlọwọ rẹ wa ni kete ti a nilo rẹ.
He has not yet been born.	O ti ko sibẹsibẹ a bi.
No, they do not.	Rara, wọn ko ṣe bẹ.
They have no interest in him.	Wọn ko ni anfani fun u.
We will look into it.	A yoo wo inu rẹ.
Just come back home.	O kan wa pada si ile.
You will tell him you love him.	Iwọ yoo sọ fun u pe o nifẹ rẹ.
It looks like it might have ended.	O dabi pe o le ti pari.
And there is something else missing.	Ati pe nkan miiran wa ti o padanu.
If you feel like you are at home, don’t show it.	Ti o ba lero pe o wa ni ile, ko fi han.
The car is really fun.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ jẹ gan fun.
Born in no.	Bi ninu rara.
I talked to other people, but just a few.	Mo ti sọrọ si awọn miiran eniyan, sugbon o kan diẹ.
But they are watching.	Ṣugbọn wọn n wo.
It is difficult to give advice without meeting any of them.	O nira lati fun imọran laisi ipade eyikeyi ninu wọn.
Children do not go to school.	Awọn ọmọde ko lọ si ile-iwe.
They start singing and singing.	Wọn bẹrẹ orin ati orin.
Can anyone help me?	Ṣe ẹnikẹni le ran mi lọwọ?
He was too alone.	O si wà ju nikan.
Everyone wants to help him.	Gbogbo eniyan fẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
The journey takes several hours.	Irin-ajo naa gba awọn wakati pupọ.
You may or may not like it.	O le fẹ tabi ko fẹ.
In my opinion, we make money to spend.	Ni ero mi, a ṣe owo lati lo.
Test yourself on what we have learned today.	Ṣe idanwo ararẹ lori ohun ti a ti kọ loni.
We must make sure that no one cares.	A gbọdọ rii daju pe ko si ẹnikan ti o tọju.
I do not know how to do it.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe.
It works to uncover the truth.	O ṣiṣẹ lati ṣii otitọ.
He liked it at first.	O fẹran rẹ ni akọkọ.
He could not find anything from here.	Ko le ri nkankan lati ibi.
We’ve done great things, but not the best things.	A ti ṣe awọn ohun nla, ṣugbọn kii ṣe awọn ohun ti o dara julọ.
Of course it will.	Dajudaju yoo ṣe.
I will not try this week.	Emi kii yoo gbiyanju ni ọsẹ yii.
He was the only other person at his age.	Oun nikan ni eniyan miiran nibi ọjọ ori rẹ.
We are here for a while.	A wa nibi fun akoko kan.
He won’t hear me do more now.	Oun ko ni gbọ ti mo ṣe diẹ sii ni bayi.
I mean no.	Mo tumọ si rara.
It’s a bit.	O jẹ diẹ.
I don’t mean they walk behind me.	Emi ko tumọ si pe wọn rin lẹhin mi.
Your body is much better now.	Ara rẹ ti dara pupọ ni bayi.
No one seemed to notice !.	Ko si ọkan dabi enipe lati se akiyesi!.
No problem at all.	Ko si ni wahala rara.
I grabbed a stick and tried to pull it out.	Mo mu igi kan mo si gbiyanju lati fa jade.
It is a festive city.	O jẹ ilu ayẹyẹ.
I will say it again.	Emi yoo sọ lẹẹkansi.
That's not as easy as it sounds.	Iyẹn ko rọrun bi o ti n dun.
The city grew in antiquity.	Ilu naa dagba ni akoko igba atijọ.
It’s a great way to grow love.	O jẹ ọna nla lati dagba ifẹ.
He does not look like a living person.	Ko dabi ẹni ti o n gbe ara.
Last night he tried to reach them.	Ni alẹ ana o gbiyanju lati de ọdọ wọn.
It is all about love.	O ti wa ni gbogbo nipa ife.
I love you, you love me.	Mo nifẹ rẹ, o nifẹ mi.
So very angry.	Nitorina binu pupọ.
If you love me you will want to do that.	Ti o ba nifẹ mi iwọ yoo fẹ lati ṣe iyẹn.
Give me something sweet, he said.	Fun mi ni nkan ti o dun, o sọ.
And if they do not, they will not pass it on.	Ati pe ti ko ba ṣe bẹ, wọn kii yoo kọja rẹ.
Okay, listen here.	O dara, gbọ nibi.
You go.	O lọ.
It has a very good explanation.	O ni alaye daradara daradara.
It is very relevant.	O jẹ ohun ti o yẹ pupọ.
But at the time, people were afraid of that group.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yẹn, awọn eniyan bẹru ti ẹgbẹ yẹn.
And it will not take much of your time.	Ati pe kii yoo gba akoko pupọ rẹ.
Not a pretty sight.	Ko kan lẹwa oju.
We know he left the party at some point.	A mọ pe o fi ayẹyẹ silẹ ni aaye kan.
This family has lost its dogs.	Idile yii ti padanu awọn aja rẹ.
He threw something on the table.	O si ju nkankan lori tabili.
Everyone is happy.	Inu gbogbo eniyan dun.
Now they have.	Bayi wọn ti ni.
This did not end well.	Eyi ko pari daradara.
It's not raining.	Ojo ko tii ro.
I made one, it made me one.	Mo ṣe ọkan, o ṣe mi ni ọkan.
She hopes more for him.	O nireti diẹ sii fun u.
I'll look into it.	Emi yoo wo inu rẹ.
Only to be found.	Nikan lati wa.
I started running again.	Mo bẹrẹ si ṣiṣe lẹẹkansi.
Her son will be their brother-in-law.	Ọmọkunrin rẹ yoo jẹ arakunrin ọkọ wọn.
I mean we believe well in what we put out.	Mo tumọ si pe a gbagbọ daradara ninu ohun ti a fi jade.
Please believe that.	Jọwọ gbagbọ pe.
Your boat was built.	A kọ ọkọ oju omi rẹ.
It is not such a big deal.	Kii ṣe iru adehun nla bẹ.
Will it hurt him?	Ṣe yoo ṣe ipalara fun u?
It was high time.	O je akoko ga.
I can deal with some of this program.	Mo ti le wo pẹlu diẹ ninu awọn eto ti o yi.
Get out of the way.	Jade kuro ni ọna.
You just have to know how to tell him what to do.	O kan ni lati mọ bi o ṣe le sọ fun u kini lati ṣe.
The family dog ​​has grown on his bed.	Aja ebi ti dagba lori ibusun rẹ.
And it almost killed me.	Ati pe o fẹrẹ pa mi.
This is a small town.	Eyi jẹ ilu kekere kan.
Someone who can run some basic tests for us.	Ẹnikan ti o le ṣiṣe diẹ ninu awọn idanwo akọkọ fun wa.
He will help me.	Oun yoo ran mi lọwọ.
All out in public.	Gbogbo jade ni gbangba.
I'm not sure how.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bi o ṣe ṣe.
He is, however, the future.	Oun ni, sibẹsibẹ, ojo iwaju.
The books are.	Awọn iwe ni.
Don't believe that.	Maṣe gbagbọ pe.
And boy, did you let me have.	Ati ọmọkunrin, ṣe o jẹ ki mi ni.
I am not sure about it.	Emi ko ni idaniloju nipa rẹ.
He put one foot in front of him.	O fi ẹsẹ kan si iwaju rẹ.
You can of course use '' to remove them.	O le dajudaju lo '' lati yọ wọn kuro.
Is there.	O wa nibẹ.
They should not tell you what to do.	Wọn ko yẹ ki o sọ fun ọ kini lati ṣe.
You have your own.	O ni ara rẹ.
He does not have a good home to live in.	Ko ni ile to dara lati gbe.
That was a minute.	Iyẹn jẹ iṣẹju kan.
He also pulled it out.	O tun ti yọ ọ jade.
He is angry.	O binu.
The money is gone and will not be refunded.	Owo naa ti lọ ati pe kii yoo san pada.
I love them all !.	Mo nifẹ gbogbo wọn!.
I ran towards him.	Mo sare si ọna rẹ.
I enjoy it all the time.	Mo gbadun nibẹ ni gbogbo igba.
Holidays begin to reach him.	Awọn isinmi bẹrẹ lati de ọdọ rẹ.
That is what he hopes will happen.	Ohun ti o nireti yoo ṣẹlẹ niyẹn.
But it is more than physical activity.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ diẹ sii ju iṣẹ ṣiṣe ti ara lọ.
And it tastes really good.	Ati ki o dun gaan.
Place them on one.	Gbe wọn si ọkan.
Here they are.	Nibi ti won wa.
I am in it here and there.	Mo wa ninu rẹ nibi ati nibẹ.
Some make their money before breakfast.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣe owo wọn ṣaaju ounjẹ owurọ.
It will not be morning.	Kii yoo jẹ owurọ.
Everyone rushed to you.	Gbogbo eniyan sare si o.
Decide what you want to say before you say it.	Pinnu ohun ti o fẹ sọ ṣaaju ki o to sọ.
There is no place nearby to get a drink.	Ko si ibi ti o wa nitosi lati gba ohun mimu.
At the very least, it would be very harmful.	Ni o kere julọ, yoo jẹ ipalara pupọ.
It is not a question.	Kii ṣe ibeere kan.
Those moments can never come again.	Awọn akoko yẹn ko le wa lẹẹkansi.
I have no idea of ​​my value as a person.	Emi ko ni imọran iye mi bi eniyan.
You have seen such faces before.	O ti rii iru awọn oju bẹ tẹlẹ.
I can't read enough.	Emi ko le ka o to.
These plans did not become a reality.	Awọn eto wọnyi ko di otitọ.
You will miss it forever.	O yoo padanu rẹ lailai.
You will understand in time.	Iwọ yoo loye ni akoko.
Music changed or added.	Orin ti yipada tabi fi kun.
I am well with this.	Mo wa daradara pẹlu eyi.
He can't tell you anything like that.	Ko le sọ ohunkohun fun ọ ni iru bẹ.
It makes it a very long time.	O jẹ ki o jẹ akoko pipẹ pupọ.
They must mean something very important.	Wọn gbọdọ tumọ nkan pataki pupọ.
He doesn't like that at all.	Oun ko fẹran eyi rara.
I promised him a warm bed.	Mo ṣe ileri ibusun gbona fun u.
Nor should anyone.	Tabi yẹ ẹnikẹni.
Everyone knows it.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ ọ.
It is incredibly good in the area as well.	O jẹ iyalẹnu dara ni agbegbe bi daradara.
Her only brother was the person who called her friend.	Arakunrin rẹ nikan ni eniyan ti o pe ọrẹ rẹ.
I know this to be true.	Mo mọ eyi lati jẹ otitọ.
I have a very good plan.	Mo ni eto to dara julọ.
It hurts a lot.	O ni ipalara pupọ.
The gift in the box is bad.	Ẹbun ti o wa ninu apoti ko dara.
He could not go back and tell them.	Ko le pada lọ sọ fun wọn.
He quickly accepted the offer.	O yara gba imọran naa.
The last thing you want is to drink.	Ohun ikẹhin ti o fẹ ni lati mu.
We have already seen this.	A ti rii eyi tẹlẹ.
I'd see it often enough and know it well.	Mo ti fẹ ri ti o igba to ati ki o mọ ti o daradara.
This tree is under other trees.	Igi yii wa labẹ awọn igi miiran.
But this is one of them.	Ṣugbọn eyi jẹ ọkan ninu wọn.
I want to live at home.	Mo fe gbe ile.
They are carrying it out.	Won n gbe e jade.
Okay, tell me what.	O dara, sọ kini fun ọ.
We do not need it here.	A ko nilo rẹ nibi.
You can not wait to see it.	O ko le duro lati ri i.
You should raise it slightly.	O yẹ ki o gbe e dide diẹ.
And maybe it would have sold a lot more.	Ati boya yoo ti ta pupọ diẹ sii.
That did not change anything.	Iyẹn ko yi ohunkohun pada.
The contract is not a written contract.	Iwe adehun naa kii ṣe iwe adehun iwe adehun ti a kọ silẹ.
But more is possible.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii le ṣee ṣe.
Okay, whatever it is.	O dara, ohunkohun ti o jẹ.

This is something else completely different.	Eyi jẹ nkan miiran patapata.
I will read through them, it may help.	Emi yoo ka nipasẹ wọn, o le ṣe iranlọwọ.
The three of them were there when he got home.	Awọn mẹta ti wọn wa nibẹ nigbati o de ile.
You want in many ways to play.	O fẹ ni ọna pupọ lati mu.
And it has got both ways.	Ati pe o ti ni awọn ọna mejeeji.
Well there you go.	Daradara nibẹ ti o lọ.
I would like to go swimming.	Emi yoo fẹ lati lọ we.
Here we have the problem.	Nibi a ni iṣoro naa.
They are not really themselves.	Wọn kii ṣe ara wọn gaan.
She loves more, much more.	O nifẹ diẹ sii, pupọ diẹ sii.
We see what happens here.	A ri ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nibi.
I can talk about your arms and legs.	Mo le sọ nipa ọwọ ati ẹsẹ rẹ.
So your words tell me.	Nitorina ọrọ rẹ sọ fun mi.
It is one foot.	Ẹsẹ kan ni.
I can hope !.	Mo le nireti!.
It's too fast.	O jẹ ounjẹ yara pupọ ju.
You wonder if it is as you say.	O ro boya o jẹ bi o ti sọ.
You will be a mother to your children.	Iwọ yoo jẹ iya fun awọn ọmọ rẹ.
To know him.	Lati mọ rẹ.
You have and you know.	Iwọ ni ati pe o mọ.
They are not for me.	Wọn kii ṣe fun mi.
If so, what are you going to do?	Ti o ba jẹ oun, kini iwọ yoo ṣe?
A few years.	Ọdun diẹ.
I'm not sorry.	Ko dun binu.
That's two to me.	Meji si mi niyẹn.
Something has stolen him.	Nkankan ti ji i.
His wife is another story.	Iyawo rẹ tun jẹ itan miiran.
We read the book and decided we try.	A ká iwe ati ki o pinnu a gbiyanju.
Lots of people around, you know.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ti o wa ni ayika, o mọ.
Don't ask me.	Maṣe beere lọwọ mi.
You can not understand it.	O ko le loye rẹ.
No, this will not pass me by.	Rara, eyi kii yoo kọja si mi.
Some of them took the baby home.	Diẹ ninu wọn mu ọmọ naa lọ si ile.
Please go without me.	Jọwọ lọ laisi mi.
I am not a police officer.	Emi kii ṣe ọlọpa.
We sat down for lunch.	A joko fun ounjẹ ọsan.
You change your mind just look at them.	O yi ori rẹ pada o kan wo wọn.
We have high mountains.	A ni awọn oke giga.
There couldn’t be a more beautiful situation.	Ko le jẹ ipo ti o lẹwa diẹ sii.
If you can help in the next few days.	Ti o ba le ṣe iranlọwọ ni awọn ọjọ diẹ ti nbọ.
Let me save you your time.	Jẹ ki n tọju rẹ akoko rẹ.
He lives the other way now.	O n gbe ni ọna miiran bayi.
Close the top of my head, no one comes to one.	Pa oke ori mi, ko si ọkan ti o wa si ọkan.
I think someone is trying to break into my house.	Mo ro pe ẹnikan n gbiyanju lati ya sinu ile mi.
But in the end for the road.	Sugbon ni ipari fun ọna.
He was happy when everyone was finished.	Inu re dun nigbati gbogbo eniyan ti pari.
The reason is not clear.	Idi rẹ ko han gbangba.
At least it appears to be alone.	O kere ju o han pe o wa nikan.
We were just hit by one last night.	A ni won o kan lu nipa ọkan kẹhin alẹ.
If not, they lose.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, wọn padanu.
The big man sat in his place.	Ọkunrin nla naa joko ni ibi tirẹ.
He will kill you.	Oun yoo pa ọ.
Up to you.	O di ọwọ rẹ.
It’s like everyone else.	O dabi gbogbo eniyan miiran.
He has lived in this house for thirty years.	O ti gbe ni ile yi fun ọgbọn ọdun.
If you want wood, buy a car that comes with one.	Ti o ba fẹ igi, ra ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan ti o wa pẹlu ọkan.
We can’t even get through them at this point.	A ko le paapaa gba nipasẹ wọn ni aaye yii.
But that is what happened.	Ṣugbọn iru ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ niyẹn.
He was taken out of the program afterwards.	A mu u jade kuro ninu eto lẹhin naa.
You may have done this.	O le ti ṣe eyi.
I let myself be.	Mo jẹ ki a mu ara mi.
The boy could no longer stand.	Ọmọkunrin naa ko le duro mọ.
You know who we are, right now.	O mọ ẹni ti a jẹ, ni bayi.
However, that may change.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn le yipada.
Or any time you see it, for that matter.	Tabi eyikeyi akoko ti o ri i, fun ti ọrọ.
She sat on the bed laughing and laughing.	O joko lori ibusun o rẹrin o si rẹrin.
I'm here.	Mo wa nibi.
I am your father.	Emi ni baba rẹ.
The story is here.	Itan naa wa nibi.
He has given the same advice in the past.	O ti fun ni imọran kanna ni igba atijọ.
I just can't wait to see it like that.	Mo kan ko le duro ri i bi iyẹn.
If you sell me out.	Ti o ba ta mi jade.
He slept with fire.	O sun pẹlu ina.
In my hometown.	Ni ilu mi.
It's their money.	Owo won ni.
I don't want that to happen to me.	Emi ko fẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ si mi.
You can learn a thing or two.	O le kọ ẹkọ ohun kan tabi meji.
Here people can see and observe, stand, talk or think.	Nibi eniyan le rii ati ṣe akiyesi, duro jẹ, sọrọ tabi ronu.
Not as something in and of itself.	Kii ṣe bi nkan ninu ati funrararẹ.
I hate birthdays.	Mo korira ojo ibi.
They caught, too.	Wọn ti mu, paapaa.
He thought he would be happy with that.	O ro pe inu rẹ yoo dun si iyẹn.
If you want to bring it back.	Ti o ba fẹ mu u pada.
And you want to do well.	Ati pe o fẹ lati ṣe daradara.
Take it easy on yourself.	Mu o rọrun lori ara rẹ.
How little do they know.	Bawo ni kekere ti wọn mọ.
Give everyone a book.	Fun gbogbo eniyan ni iwe kan.
He looked up at the dog.	O wo oke aja.
Or anyone else.	Tabi ẹnikẹni miiran.
You don't want to see.	O ko fẹ lati ri.
I can see it is gone.	Mo le rii pe o ti lọ.
No one questioned his methods.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o beere awọn ọna rẹ.
It was a simple test.	O jẹ idanwo ti o rọrun.
But let me see.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki n rii.
I can reach you without others knowing that we are interested.	Mo le de ọdọ rẹ laisi awọn miiran mọ pe a nifẹ si.
Baby.	Bayi.
Let me know what you decided in the end.	Jẹ ki n mọ ohun ti o pinnu ni ipari.
He also kept them.	O tun pa wọn mọ.
But, they have not yet seen this power, either.	Ṣugbọn, wọn ko tii ri agbara yii, boya.
Great way to help people.	Ọna nla lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun eniyan.
Ko ka.	Ko ka.
Just open and unlock.	O kan ṣii ati ṣii bọtini.
There is no point in doing anything.	Ko si aaye ni ṣiṣe ohunkohun.
You do not believe in yourself.	Iwọ ko gbagbọ funrararẹ.
He was a really amazing person.	O je kan gan iyanu eniyan.
And, of course, no more than a year.	Ati pe, dajudaju, ko le ju ọdun kan lọ.
I do not need to look at the table.	Emi ko nilo lati wo si tabili.
I’m back into them.	Mo n pada sinu wọn.
I asked a simple question.	Mo beere ibeere ti o rọrun.
You know how celebrations are.	O mọ bi awọn ayẹyẹ ṣe jẹ.
Way too early to be without your mother.	Ọna ju ni kutukutu lati wa laisi iya rẹ.
They live their lives and you live your life.	Wọn gbe igbesi aye wọn ati pe o gbe tirẹ.
Someone wants to have money from you, my friend.	Ẹnikan fẹ lati ni owo lọwọ rẹ, ọrẹ mi.
Also more for myself.	Tun diẹ sii fun ara mi.
I did not call.	Emi ko pe.
And not only that.	Kii ṣe iyẹn nikan.
Journey.	Irin-ajo.
I want another test or another type of test.	Mo fẹ idanwo miiran tabi iru idanwo miiran.
I can't say we won't do it at all.	Nko le so pe a ko ni se rara.
I think there may be others.	Mo ro pe awọn miiran le wa.
We made life.	A ṣe aye.
He did not move to see that the program was over.	Ko gbe lati rii pe eto ti pari.
Growing up late.	Ti n dagba pẹ.
See what he did to you.	Wo ohun ti o ṣe si ọ.
They are selling something.	Won n ta nkan.
He did this on purpose.	O ṣe eyi lori idi.
The project was abandoned after several accidents.	A kọ iṣẹ naa silẹ lẹhin ọpọlọpọ awọn ijamba.
I have other plans to do.	Mo ni awọn eto miiran lati ṣe.
Highs come to open.	Awọn giga wa lati si .
Neither is it of man.	Bẹni kii ṣe ti eniyan.
A bag will arrive soon.	Apo kan yoo de laipẹ.
They did that job well.	Wọn ṣe iṣẹ yẹn daradara.
It comes with a plan.	O wa pẹlu eto kan.
What we need is for the river to clean.	Ohun ti a nilo ni fun odo lati nu.
It just caught my attention completely.	O kan fa akiyesi mi patapata.
So he laughed at me.	Nitorina o rẹrin si mi.
I’m with something to go with the advice you have.	Mo wa pẹlu nkan lati lọ pẹlu imọran ti o ni.
So we met at an age.	Nitorina a pade ni ọjọ ori.
Get up early tomorrow.	Dide ni kutukutu ọla.
So bad he had been killed.	Nitorina buburu o ti pa a.
But she has a sister.	Ṣugbọn o ni arabinrin kan.
A letter was sent to their first doctor.	A fi lẹta ranṣẹ si dokita akọkọ wọn.
He knew he was wrong.	O mọ pe o ṣe aṣiṣe.
They can be beautiful.	Wọn le lẹwa.
What does it mean.	Kini o jẹ.
At least that's what they believe.	O kere ju iyẹn ni ohun ti wọn gbagbọ.
At more or less the same time.	Ni diẹ sii tabi kere si akoko kanna.
Dad has been there a good many times.	Baba ti wa nibẹ kan ti o dara ọpọlọpọ igba.
I'll keep an eye out.	Emi yoo pa oju kan mọ.
Do not ask me anything.	Maṣe beere lọwọ mi ohunkohun.
You go with someone, too.	O lọ pẹlu ẹnikan, paapaa.
Lifting my legs up.	Mimu ẹsẹ mi soke.
It does not mean anything.	Ko tumọ si nkankan.
They arrested me.	Won mu mi.
Does not matter.	Iyẹn ko ṣe pataki.
I run because it's fun.	Mo sare nitori o ni fun.
That is not my concern.	Iyẹn kii ṣe aniyan mi.
Great for groups and family.	Nla fun awọn ẹgbẹ ati ebi.
So it is wrong to kill.	Nitorina o jẹ aṣiṣe lati pa.
I can usually drink a lot of it.	Mo ti le maa mu pupo ti o.
That brought me back.	Iyẹn mu mi pada.
You can start the train.	O le bẹrẹ ọkọ oju irin.
The day did not start well.	Ọjọ naa ko bẹrẹ daradara.
High and low.	Ga ati kekere.
It's too late since her last birthday.	O ti pẹ ju lati ọjọ ibi rẹ kẹhin.
I can also tell you.	Mo tun le sọ fun ọ.
Something he thought but could not see, he hurried.	Nkankan ti o ro ṣugbọn ko le ri, o yara yara.
Now look at it.	Bayi wo nipa rẹ.
They like you or they don't like you.	Wọn fẹ ọ tabi wọn ko fẹ.
Very good, really.	O dara pupọ, ni otitọ.
We do not know for sure.	A ko mọ nipa iyẹn gaan.
Don't worry about time.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan nipa akoko.
This is what.	Ohun ni yi.
Is already here.	Ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
They love the game.	Wọn nifẹ ere naa.
Ask him to wait for dinner.	Beere lọwọ rẹ lati duro fun ounjẹ alẹ.
But stay tuned.	Ṣugbọn duro ni iyalẹnu.
Best to keep it simple on my own.	Dara julọ lati jẹ ki o rọrun lori ara mi.
It will not be a good time at all.	Kii yoo jẹ akoko ti o dara julọ rara.
He did not try to move, he knew he was broken.	Ko gbiyanju lati gbe, o mọ pe o ti fọ.
This is their home.	Eyi ni ile wọn.
For man, for me.	Fun eniyan, fun mi.
Never seen it coming.	Ko tii ri ti o nbọ.
Remember the age of the child.	Ranti ọjọ ori ọmọ naa.
The weather is.	Oju ojo je.
They must not have anything good to do.	Wọn ko gbọdọ ni ohunkohun ti o dara julọ lati ṣe.
And inside, you know that.	Ati inu, o mọ pe.
This may take a few minutes.	Eyi le gba to iṣẹju diẹ.
He wants to get it.	O fe lati gba o.
But he did.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe.
They can also be bad.	Wọn tun le jẹ buburu.
You see how it goes.	O ri bi o ti n lọ.
You can just say the way you sit there.	O le kan sọ ọna ti o joko nibẹ.
We have very clear on our value.	A ni gaan ko o lori wa iye.
I know he doesn't really believe me, but that's fine.	Mo mọ pe ko gba mi gbọ gaan, ṣugbọn iyẹn dara.
I want to finish my work here.	Mo fe pari ise mi nibi.
That is who we want to be.	Iyẹn ni ẹni ti a fẹ lati jẹ.
This is how you get jobs.	Eyi ni bi o ṣe gba awọn iṣẹ.
The world will change.	Aye yoo yipada.
We do not understand them.	A ko loye wọn.
One is that your body is good.	Ọkan ni pe ara rẹ dara.
I will come.	Emi yoo wa.
It’s not that it matters.	Kii ṣe pe o ṣe pataki.
After all, no other story would be of any understanding.	Lẹhin eyi, ko si itan miiran ti yoo jẹ oye eyikeyi.
I do not have to.	Emi ko ni lati.
They are nothing.	Wọn kii ṣe ohunkohun.
My job can't.	Iṣẹ mi ko le.
I'll tell you.	Emi yoo sọ fun ọ.
But maybe they have.	Ṣugbọn boya wọn ni.
What matters is what we see.	Ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni ohun ti a ri.
I am the best person to die.	Emi ni ẹni ti o dara julọ lati ku.
I can see it coming.	Mo le rii pe o nbọ.
You can use something to drink on the way home.	O le lo nkan lati mu ni ọna ile.
Serious things.	Awọn nkan ti o ṣe pataki.
He called me.	O pe mi.
To call you.	Lati pe e.
Everyone sat around for hours.	Gbogbo eniyan ti joko ni ayika fun awọn wakati.
I am not good at such a thing.	Emi ko dara ni iru nkan bẹẹ.
After you hit the minimum time, start the test.	Lẹhin ti o lu akoko ti o kere ju, bẹrẹ idanwo.
This question is written.	Ti kọ ibeere yii.
Have you tried on another outfit?	Ṣe o gbiyanju lori aṣọ miiran?
The work can be very difficult.	Iṣẹ naa le pupọ.
It was not possible to meet his mother.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati pade iya rẹ.
The man is watching you.	Ọkunrin naa n wo ọ.
There are many other things as well.	Ọpọlọpọ nkan miiran tun wa.
Learn to love yourself.	Kọ ẹkọ lati nifẹ ara rẹ.
They are long.	Wọn ti gun.
He almost left when his friend stopped him.	O fẹrẹ lọ nigbati ọrẹ rẹ da a duro.
They did that and it was good.	Wọn ṣe nkan yẹn ati pe o dara.
And we are well on the way to that.	Ati pe a wa daradara lori ọna si iyẹn.
Of course not.	Dajudaju, kii ṣe bẹẹ.
Time to be on your way.	Akoko lati wa ni ọna rẹ.
People live here.	Eniyan n gbe nibi.
Works great too.	Ṣiṣẹ dara julọ paapaa.
The hour is over.	Wakati naa ti kọja.
We must take advantage of this.	A gbọdọ lo anfani yii.
Okay, but it doesn't.	O dara, ṣugbọn ko ṣe.
It stands on this point.	O duro lori aaye yii.
You want to say more.	O fẹ lati sọ diẹ sii.
No, more than wisdom.	Rara, ju ọgbọn lọ.
And that will not change.	Ati pe iyẹn kii yoo yipada.
Use what you have written here.	Lo ohun ti o ti kọ nibi.
But, here in the winter, they are always possible that way.	Ṣugbọn, nibi ni igba otutu, wọn ṣee ṣe nigbagbogbo ni ọna yẹn.
It is true in material.	O jẹ otitọ ni ohun elo.
Must have read it.	Gbọdọ ti ka o.
Others, they have points.	Awọn miiran, wọn ni awọn aaye.
I will teach you to laugh a lot.	Emi yoo kọ ọ lati rẹrin pupọ.
Its conclusion, however, is simple.	Ipari rẹ, sibẹsibẹ, rọrun.
You can stand this and you will.	O le duro si eyi ati pe iwọ yoo.
Your inner thoughts are always beyond your abilities.	Awọn ero inu rẹ nigbagbogbo ti kọja awọn agbara rẹ.
They call it the most personal device they have ever made.	Wọn pe ni ẹrọ ti ara ẹni julọ ti wọn ti ṣe.
I understand more than you think.	Mo loye diẹ sii ju bi o ti ro lọ.
I kept it to myself.	Mo ti pa o si ara mi.
He noticed the wedding party.	O ṣe akiyesi ẹgbẹ igbeyawo naa.
Then the story begins.	Nigba naa ni itan naa bẹrẹ.
I'll have enough.	Emi yoo ni to.
You don’t see his face or anything.	O ko ri oju rẹ tabi nkankan.
I mean, it still works more or less.	Mo tumọ si, o tun ṣiṣẹ diẹ sii tabi kere si.
Trees grow not as easy as it may appear.	Awọn igi dagba ko rọrun bi o ti le han.
Let him find his way back on his own.	Jẹ ki o wa ọna rẹ pada funrararẹ.
This did not please our mother.	Eyi ko dun iya wa.
That's how it goes.	Bi o ṣe n lọ niyẹn.
His mouth was closed, so he could not speak.	Ẹnu rẹ ti di, nitori naa ko le sọ.
It was all kind of accident.	O jẹ gbogbo iru ijamba.
Because of him.	Nitori re.
But the woman had not yet found herself.	Ṣugbọn obinrin naa ko tii ri ara rẹ̀.
You must not return to this place.	Iwọ ko gbọdọ pada si ibi.
Your body goes up.	Ara rẹ lọ soke.
I just want my old life back.	Mo kan fẹ ki igbesi aye atijọ mi pada.
After years of making music, now that really matters.	Lẹhin awọn ọdun ti ṣiṣe orin, ni bayi iyẹn ṣe pataki gaan.
It has to be tomorrow.	O ni lati wa ni ọla.
He did not spend a day at home.	Ko lo ọjọ kan ni ile.
But that doesn’t make it right.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko jẹ ki o tọ.
Maybe even more.	Boya paapaa diẹ sii.
Some items can be found here.	Diẹ ninu awọn ohun kan le ṣee ri nibi.
Was really good.	Wà gan ti o dara.
She’s grown up now and she knows it.	O ti dagba ni bayi ati pe o mọ ọ.
He raised his hand.	O gbe ọwọ jade.
I just visited.	Mo kan ṣabẹwo.
Those words are true.	Awọn ọrọ yẹn jẹ otitọ.
But it will not take long.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo gba akoko pipẹ.
There is no room for anything else in my thoughts.	Ko si aaye fun nkan miiran ninu awọn ero mi.
We all agree.	Adehun gbogbo wa.
For the morning.	Fun owurọ.
I have for about a month.	Mo ni fun bii awọn oṣu.
But we were.	Sugbon a wà.

Who knows where it came from?	Tani o mọ ibiti o ti wa?
So my time was there great.	Nitorina akoko mi wa nibẹ nla.
I could have really hurt her.	Mo ti le ti ipalara rẹ gaan.
I had a great day with my wife and my two children.	Mo ni ọjọ nla pẹlu iyawo mi ati awọn ọmọ mi meji.
You see what happens.	O wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
They will, but they know it is not their intention to do so.	Wọn yoo ṣe, ṣugbọn wọn mọ pe kii ṣe ipinnu wọn lati ṣe.
Stand in front of you, not on top of you.	Duro ni iwaju rẹ, kii ṣe lori oke rẹ.
Bad guy to catch.	Eniyan buburu lati yẹ.
Have the children eaten?	Njẹ awọn ọmọ ti jẹ ounjẹ?
Don’t let things get to you.	Maṣe jẹ ki awọn nkan le fun ara rẹ.
He waited for a while to make sure.	O duro fun akoko kan lati rii daju.
But not too long after the first.	Sugbon ko gun ju lẹhin akọkọ.
The picture is beautiful.	Aworan naa lẹwa.
Maybe only one good one.	Boya ọkan ti o dara nikan.
But not the baby.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ọmọ naa.
Wake up before dawn.	Ji ṣaaju owurọ.
I can see there.	Mo le rii nibẹ.
The children sat there for hours.	Awọn ọmọde joko nibẹ fun awọn wakati.
I can’t agree with that.	Emi ko le gba pẹlu iyẹn.
Just go the wrong way.	O kan lọ si ọna ti ko tọ.
Life on the road wore on.	Igbesi aye lori ọna ti wọ lori rẹ.
It is necessary.	O ṣe pataki.
Time does that.	Akoko ṣe iyẹn.
It has a city appliance.	O ni ohun elo ilu kan.
I am not sure how you can complete this task right now.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bi o ṣe le pari iṣẹ yii ni bayi.
We went to sleep after tea.	A lọ sun lẹhin tii.
You can wash a lot.	O le wẹ pupọ.
It does not take place at all.	Ko gba aye rara.
We are happy to open our front doors again.	Inu wa dun lati ṣi awọn ilẹkun iwaju wa lẹẹkansi.
It's not my lunch.	Ko jẹ ounjẹ ọsan mi.
The more you play the more you want.	Awọn diẹ ti o mu awọn diẹ ti o fẹ.
I need to think about this.	Mo nilo lati ronu nipa eyi.
I like the way you think.	Mo fẹran ọna ti o ro.
Let it be late and happy!	Jẹ ki o pẹ ati ki o dun!
Try to leave.	Gbiyanju lati lọ kuro.
It has been well observed.	A ti ṣe akiyesi rẹ daradara.
The question, of course, when.	Ibeere naa, dajudaju, nigbawo.
I agree to pick up two weeks before my date.	Mo gba lati gbe soke ọsẹ meji ṣaaju ki o to ọjọ mi.
Nothing is right, nothing is clear.	Ko si ohun ti o tọ, ko si ohun ti o han.
For the things you want.	Fun awọn nkan ti o fẹ.
And they say men can’t get it.	Ati pe wọn sọ pe awọn ọkunrin ko le gba.
The same person filled out the questionnaire.	Eniyan kanna naa kun iwe ibeere naa.
It is something you have been thinking about for a long time.	O jẹ nkan ti o ti ronu fun igba pipẹ.
We will have a lot of that.	A yoo ni pupọ ninu iyẹn.
That's the boys' point.	Ọrọ awọn ọmọkunrin niyẹn.
He pulled away, but it was too late.	O fa kuro, ṣugbọn o ti pẹ ju.
It's like us, one says.	O dabi wa, ọkan sọ.
It does not change.	Ko yipada.
But this time, he will have to.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yii, oun yoo ni lati.
They found the car.	Wọn ri ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
Most cities have banned cars from their factories.	Pupọ julọ awọn ilu ti fi ofin de awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ lati awọn ile-iṣẹ wọn.
He speaks for himself only now.	O sọ fun ara rẹ nikan ni bayi.
Do your job alone.	Ṣe iṣẹ rẹ nikan.
It seems good enough.	O dabi enipe o dara to.
The word "not" is in the right place.	Ọrọ naa "kii ṣe" ti wa ni ibi ti o tọ.
I will do this thing.	Emi yoo ṣe nkan yii.
Much has changed in recent years.	Pupọ yipada ni awọn ọdun ti o lọ.

The children wore winter clothes.	Awọn ọmọde ti wọ aṣọ igba otutu.
He has found his home.	O ti ri ile rẹ.
Three other problems also arose.	Awọn iṣoro mẹta miiran tun dide.
They will do through anything.	Wọn yoo ṣe nipasẹ ohunkohun.
No way.	Ko ṣee ṣe.
They don’t look like teenagers anymore.	Wọn ko dabi awọn ọdọ mọ.
He seemed to have eyes on the back of his head.	O dabi ẹni pe o ni oju ni ẹhin ori rẹ.
Let him do this.	Jẹ ki o ṣe eyi.
This requires more than water to complete it.	Eyi nilo diẹ sii ju omi lọ lati pari rẹ.
You will be the most important person in the community.	Iwọ yoo jẹ eniyan pataki ni agbegbe.
It's too broken.	O ti fọ pupọ.
After dinner, she planned her day.	Lẹhin ounjẹ alẹ, o gbero ọjọ rẹ.
When he grabbed her hand, he just touched her.	Nigbati o di ọwọ rẹ mu, o kan si i.
We should not tell him.	A ko yẹ ki o sọ fun u.
He tied his hand behind his back.	O di ọwọ rẹ lẹhin rẹ.
The tea is small, but not sweet.	Tii naa kere, ṣugbọn ko dun.
It stopped me to tell him more.	O duro fun mi lati sọ fun u diẹ sii.
Just people.	O kan eniyan.
If this.	Ti eyi ba.
She is my best friend.	O jẹ ọrẹ mi to dara julọ.
That is what everyone is.	Ohun ti gbogbo eniyan ni niyẹn.
Could not find any information about it.	Ko le ri eyikeyi alaye nipa rẹ.
Don't worry about how often that will happen.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan nipa iye igba ti iyẹn yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Maybe you made a mistake.	Boya o ṣe aṣiṣe.
I just can not know.	Mo kan ko le mọ.
One of the students lost his mother recently.	Ọkan ninu awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ti padanu iya rẹ laipẹ.
Unlike other people.	Ko dabi awọn eniyan miiran.
He came to me.	O wa si mi.
It was that time of year again.	O jẹ akoko yẹn ti ọdun lẹẹkansi.
You want to know that you want to be your wife.	O fẹ lati mọ pe o fẹ lati jẹ iyawo rẹ.
I have never heard from him to this day.	Emi ko tii gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ mọ titi di oni.
It also made me laugh many years after the truth.	O tun jẹ ki n rẹrin ọpọlọpọ ọdun lẹhin otitọ.
The trees are finished.	Awọn igi pari.
Let’s not have more.	Jẹ ki a ko ni diẹ sii.
Maybe it’s just a test.	Boya o jẹ idanwo nikan.
This is very important.	Eyi ṣe pataki pupọ.
You have nothing to give.	O ko ni nkankan lati fun.
Obviously they are trying to outdo themselves.	O han gbangba pe wọn n gbiyanju lati ju ara wọn lọ.
He repaired the system.	O tun eto naa ṣe.
Nothing more to say.	Ko si ohun miiran lati sọ.
I can see it going.	Mo le rii pe o n lọ.
There is no place like home.	Ko si aaye bi ile.
Some time has passed.	Igba diẹ ti kọja.
He will leave his wife and live with me.	Oun yoo fi iyawo rẹ silẹ ki o si gbe pẹlu mi.
Even after he was arrested.	Paapaa lẹhin ti o ti mu.
Both have changed.	Awọn mejeeji ti yipada.
These ideas go beyond them.	Awọn imọran wọnyi kọja wọn.
He said no, no he could not do that.	O sọ rara, rara ko le ṣe iyẹn.
I just forgot the meeting.	Mo kan gbagbe ipade naa.
I feel so old.	Mo lero ki atijọ.
He drove and drove.	O wakọ o si wakọ.
You can hear them before you see them.	O le gbọ wọn ṣaaju ki o to ri wọn.
We are the future, the past.	A jẹ ọjọ iwaju, o ti kọja.
However, more work is always needed.	Sibẹsibẹ, nigbagbogbo iṣẹ diẹ sii nilo.
This makes us happy.	Eyi jẹ ki inu wa dun.
There is no information.	Ko si alaye rẹ.
But it should not be.	Ṣugbọn ko yẹ ki o wa.
It should have been locked.	O yẹ ki o ti ti ilẹkun.
So, he shook his head.	Nitorina, o mi ori rẹ.
It is time to start thinking about the future.	O to akoko ti a bẹrẹ lati ronu nipa ọjọ iwaju.
He always does.	Nigbagbogbo o ṣe.
You can do it with the bed now.	O le ṣe pẹlu ibusun ni bayi.
He does not know how to know this.	Ko mọ bi o ṣe mọ eyi.
I think for the money there is a way to go.	Mo ro pe fun owo naa ni ọna lati lọ.
You must learn to play by the rules!	O gbọdọ kọ ẹkọ lati mu ṣiṣẹ nipasẹ awọn ofin!
Well you may have reasons for it.	Daradara o le ni awọn idi fun o.
Children are full of energy.	Awọn ọmọde kun fun agbara.
Everyone knows this.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ eyi.
It is difficult to leave this side.	O nira lati lọ kuro ni ẹgbẹ yii.
It seemed to have it all.	O dabi enipe o ni gbogbo rẹ.
So put this into one.	Nitorina gbe eyi si ọkan.
You will not give up and that is it.	Iwọ kii yoo fi silẹ ati pe iyẹn ni.
Something trying to stop him.	Nkankan ti o n gbiyanju lati mu u duro.
You have finished the game when you do that it is not wrong.	O ti pari ere nigbati o ba ṣe iyẹn kii ṣe aṣiṣe.
There is no tree in sight.	Ko si igi ni oju.
There are only two ways.	Awọn ọna meji nikan lo wa.
We are all fine.	Gbogbo wa daradara.
He did not accept.	Ko gba.
Like, a lot of people have seen.	Bii, ọpọlọpọ eniyan ti rii.
And at this point it looks like we are there.	Ati ni aaye yii o dabi pe a wa nibẹ.
Music fills my head.	Ero orin kun ori mi.
You look over.	O wo lori.
This is not a team effort.	Eyi kii ṣe iṣẹ ẹgbẹ.
And they are the right questions.	Ati pe wọn jẹ awọn ibeere ti o tọ.
No services available.	Ko si awọn iṣẹ ti o wa.
Here are the facts.	Eyi ni awọn otitọ.
I am a great mother.	Emi ni iya nla.
Save water.	Tọju omi.
It's very simple.	O rọrun pupọ.
Come on everyone, let’s eat.	Wa lori gbogbo eniyan, jẹ ki a jẹun.
I want you to know.	Mo fẹ ki o mọ.
You will be back here in a minute.	Iwọ yoo pada wa nibi ni iṣẹju kan.
What they saw was.	Ohun ti wọn rii ni.
Not much.	Ko si pupọ.
What is good for them is good for everyone.	Ohun ti o dara fun wọn dara fun gbogbo eniyan.
I think most people want it to be.	Mo ro pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan fẹ ki o jẹ.
I do not want to see any more advice today.	Emi ko fẹ lati ri imọran miiran loni.
Life can be very difficult.	Igbesi aye le pupọ.
This was adopted by the company.	Eyi ti gba nipasẹ ile-iṣẹ naa.
Maybe it will help you when the weather is bad this winter.	Boya o yoo ran ọ lọwọ nigbati oju ojo ko dara ni igba otutu yii.
Have a lunch meeting with a friend.	Ṣe ipade ọsan pẹlu ọrẹ kan.
I want so bad.	Mo fẹ bẹ buburu.
I can have stories to tell.	Mo le ni awọn itan lati sọ.
He loved both.	O feran awọn mejeeji.
A year or two in a company.	Ọdun kan tabi meji ni ile-iṣẹ kan.
Some children do not learn to read or write.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọde ko kọ ẹkọ lati ka tabi kọ.
We want both by something.	A fẹ mejeeji nipasẹ nkankan.
I am happy.	Inu mi dun.
You can't ask for much better than that.	O ko le beere fun Elo dara ju ti.
If we are here, we are here.	Ti a ba wa nibi, a wa nibi.
I was wrong.	Mo ni aṣiṣe.
They love values ​​here at school.	Wọn fẹran awọn iye nibi ni ile-iwe.
Well, he didn't even grow up there.	O dara, ko paapaa dagba nibẹ rara.
But they make us who we are.	Ṣugbọn wọn ṣe wa ti a jẹ.
Even after two operations, the problem persisted.	Paapaa lẹhin awọn iṣẹ meji, iṣoro naa tẹsiwaju.
It's out.	O jade.
For the whole year.	Fun gbogbo odun.
I can open the door or close it.	Mo le ṣi ilẹkun tabi pa a mọ.
He said one of us.	O sọ ọkan ninu wa.
Other people will feel something.	Miiran eniyan yoo lero nkankan.
But he did not want to say anything to me.	Ṣugbọn ko fẹ lati sọ ohunkohun fun mi.
That will be too late.	Iyẹn yoo pẹ ju.
I just helped them use the water.	Mo kan ran wọn lọwọ lati lo omi naa.
But it brought us.	Ṣugbọn o mu wa.
The first song is local.	Orin akọkọ jẹ agbegbe.
They locked the door.	Wọn ti ilẹkun.
Look at your men.	Wo awọn ọkunrin rẹ.
I need that new key.	Mo nilo bọtini tuntun naa.
Even we will not know what happened to you.	Paapaa a kii yoo mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si ọ.
They didn’t talk for the first few minutes.	Wọn ko sọrọ fun awọn iṣẹju diẹ akọkọ.
But no one knows.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹniti o mọ.
She remembers it.	O ranti rẹ.
We are going in the right direction.	A n lọ ni ọna ti o tọ.
My company is losing money.	Ile-iṣẹ mi n padanu owo.
And all you have to do is ask.	Ati pe gbogbo ohun ti o ni lati ṣe ni beere.
A piece of information to be revealed.	A nkan ti alaye lati wa ni han.
Until school starts.	Titi ti ile-iwe yoo bẹrẹ.
People who know you.	Eniyan ti o mọ ọ.
It all seemed so simple at the time.	O ti gbogbo dabi ki o rọrun ni akoko.
It should be stated below.	O yẹ ki o sọ ni isalẹ.
As many people as possible.	Bi ọpọlọpọ eniyan ti ṣee ṣe.
This is the only advice not to buy into anything yet.	Eyi jẹ imọran nikan lati ma ra sinu ohunkohun sibẹsibẹ.
We do not know how.	A ko mọ bawo.
Right now, they’re doing both at the same time.	Ni bayi, wọn n ṣe mejeeji ni akoko kanna.
I made no mistake.	Emi ko ṣe aṣiṣe kan.
I made one for myself first to see how it was.	Mo ṣe ọkan fun ara mi ni akọkọ lati rii bi o ṣe jẹ.
They didn’t last long, and nothing changed.	Wọn ko duro fun igba pipẹ, ati pe ko si ohun ti o yipada.
That does not mean standing still in the do not try.	Iyẹn ko tumọ si duro bi ninu maṣe gbiyanju.
It is an issue we should not have had to deal with.	O jẹ ọrọ ti ko yẹ ki a ti ni lati ba sọrọ.
However, there is always something.	Sibẹsibẹ, ohun kan wa nigbagbogbo.
You look to see if there is anyone you know.	O wo lati rii boya ẹnikan wa ti o mọ.
Maybe one day, but not yet.	Boya ojo kan, sugbon ko sibẹsibẹ.
The streets are lit by fire.	Awọn ita ti wa ni ina nipasẹ ina.
Don't touch me.	Maṣe kan mi.
This has now become a major problem.	Eyi ti di iṣoro pataki kan bayi.
I take to the street.	Mo ya si ita.
He will love you.	Oun yoo nifẹ rẹ.

This gives him a few minutes to think before proceeding.	Eyi fun u ni awọn iṣẹju diẹ lati ronu ṣaaju ki o tẹsiwaju.
He thought of me.	O ro mi.
These ears are not me.	Awọn eti wọnyi kii ṣe emi.

I have to believe that it will all work out.	Mo ni lati gbagbọ pe gbogbo rẹ yoo ṣiṣẹ jade.
I need to keep it to make it work.	Mo nilo lati pa lati jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.

Other than that we will see what happens !.	Miiran ju ti a yoo ri ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ!.
Their children are like his children.	Awọn ọmọ wọn dabi awọn ọmọ rẹ.

Many of us do not know them or even hear of them.	Pupọ ninu wa ko mọ wọn tabi paapaa gbọ ti wọn.

They will continue to work with us.	Wọn yoo tẹsiwaju lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu wa.
Can't do it again.	Ko le tun ṣe lẹẹkansi.
They refused.	Wọ́n kọ̀ ọ́.
This drops it to the back of the field.	Eyi sọ ọ silẹ si ẹhin aaye naa.
You got that for.	O ni iyẹn lọ fun.
You can do anything else.	O le ṣe ohunkohun miiran.

But let’s say you’re right.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki a sọ pe o tọ.
I like dogs.	Mo feran aja.
We see this in many truths.	A ri eyi ni ọpọlọpọ awọn otitọ.
This is the man.	Ọkunrin yii ni.
We did the rest.	A ṣe isinmi naa.
I feel this.	Mo lero eyi.
And it’s growing.	Ati pe o n dagba.
A great program.	Eto nla kan.
See there for more information.	Wo nibẹ fun alaye sii.
It has done so much for me.	O ti ṣe pupọ fun mi.
It doesn't matter.	Ko ṣe pataki.
He’s not that kind of good.	Oun kii ṣe iru ti o dara.
It means something, that is convincing.	O tumọ si nkankan, ti iyẹn ni idaniloju.
We know it’s not all about money for us.	A mọ pe kii ṣe gbogbo nipa owo fun wa.
I stand, eyes wide.	Mo duro, awọn oju wo.
I would have had enough.	Emi yoo ti to.
It really helps.	O ṣe iranlọwọ gaan.
He is very interested in it.	O ni ife pupọ ninu rẹ.
Let me help.	Jẹ ki n ṣe iranlọwọ.
For a while everything was still.	Fun akoko kan ohun gbogbo wà ṣi.
And maybe it’s better that it doesn’t.	Ati boya o dara julọ pe ko ṣe.
We can not go without water.	A ko le lọ laisi omi.
He does not ask, and you will not tell him.	O ko ni beere, ati awọn ti o yoo ko so fun u.
But he has not been contacted since.	Ṣugbọn o ko ti kan si lati igba naa.
A simple word, consisting of only three letters.	Ọrọ ti o rọrun kan, ti o ni awọn lẹta mẹta nikan.
I can’t wait to see if we are no better friends anymore.	Emi ko le duro pe a kii ṣe ọrẹ to dara julọ mọ.
We left early today, he said.	A lọ kuro ni kutukutu loni, o sọ.
In other words, give it a try.	Ninu awọn ọrọ miiran, fun o kan gbiyanju.
Lots of flights going on time.	Pupọ awọn ọkọ ofurufu n lọ ni akoko.
And he wanted a company.	Ati pe o fẹ ile-iṣẹ.
Someone may have taken some life on it.	Ẹnikan le ti gba aye diẹ lori rẹ.
It may be true.	O le jẹ otitọ.
More on that decision and others below.	Diẹ sii lori ipinnu yẹn ati awọn miiran ni isalẹ.
So we don’t look at this anymore.	Nitorina a ko wo eyi mọ.
She celebrated her wedding anniversary.	O ṣe ayẹyẹ ayẹyẹ igbeyawo rẹ.
A father even.	Baba kan paapaa.
This will keep it from turning back.	Eyi yoo jẹ ki o ma yi pada sẹhin.
I am very happy with my decision to buy this place.	Inu mi dun si ipinnu mi lati ra ibi yii.
We write this the hard way.	A kọ eyi ni ọna lile.
Not about me.	Kii ṣe nipa mi.
But there is not enough work for everyone involved.	Ṣugbọn ko si iṣẹ ti o to fun gbogbo eniyan ti o wa.
That is an important point.	Iyẹn jẹ aaye pataki kan.
Treat a man as if he were another child.	Mu ọkunrin kan mu bi o kan jẹ ọmọ miiran.
You have to love them.	O ni lati nifẹ wọn.
Life is in the seas.	Aye wa ninu awọn okun.
We stopped.	A duro.
And when you call, we have to get up.	Ati nigbati o ba pe, a ni lati dide.
I don’t want to agree with him too.	Emi ko fẹ lati gba pẹlu rẹ ju.
You have made them great.	O ti ṣe wọn nla.
It also works there.	O tun ṣiṣẹ nibẹ.
I do not have to wait long.	Emi ko ni lati duro gun.
No fire, no heat.	Ko si ina, ko si ooru.
Don’t ask me to do that, period.	Maṣe beere lọwọ mi lati ṣe iyẹn, akoko.
It is true of the whole situation.	O jẹ otitọ ti gbogbo ipo naa.
I think they were right at the time.	Mo ro pe wọn jẹ otitọ ni akoko naa.
I learned from them.	Mo kọ kuro lati wọn.
I have two parents.	Mo ni obi meji.
They are coming.	Wọn ti bọ.
Do it well.	Ṣe o daradara.
Is working every day.	Ti wa ni iṣẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
It goes without another word.	O lọ laisi ọrọ miiran.
I did not go there.	Emi ko lọ nibẹ.
Tell me to see him.	Sọ fun mi lati wo oun.
It is young and standing and very light.	O ti wa ni odo ati ki o duro ati ki o gidigidi ina.
This is a big mistake.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe nla kan.
If you place it into one of these, it works.	Ti o ba gbe o sinu ọkan ninu awọn, o ṣiṣẹ.
Let me take a look at that.	Jẹ ki n ṣe akiyesi iyẹn.
That means more work for me.	Iyẹn tumọ si iṣẹ diẹ sii fun mi.
I love it so much.	Mo nifẹ rẹ pupọ.
This will be fast.	Kii yoo yara.
I refuse to read my own books.	Mo kọ lati ka awọn iwe ti ara mi.
You must wait.	O gbọdọ duro.
That's not yours.	Iyẹn kii ṣe tirẹ.
Now your eyes are closed.	Bayi oju rẹ ti di.
I have never seen it so.	Emi ko tii ri bẹ.
There is nothing to fear, he said.	Ko si nkankan lati bẹru, o sọ.
They live where they work.	Wọn n gbe ni ibi ti wọn ṣiṣẹ.
I assure you, no.	Mo da o loju, ko si.
I am older than that now.	Mo ti dagba ju iyẹn lọ ni bayi.
I have no idea.	Nko ni ero kankan.
We cannot accept.	A ko le gba.
We note, however.	A ṣe akiyesi, sibẹsibẹ.
She washes her hands often.	O n fo ọwọ rẹ nigbagbogbo.
I don’t think you do.	Emi ko ro pe o ṣe.
He does not know.	Ko si mọ.
I mean really touch it.	Mo tumọ si fi ọwọ kan rẹ gaan.
It is one of the most interesting things in the world.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn julọ awon ohun ni aye.
At one point he saw someone like him.	Ni akoko kan o ri ẹnikan ti o dabi rẹ.
It’s hard, but it’s worth it.	O jẹ lile, ṣugbọn o tọ.
You know what you have there.	O mọ ohun ti o ni nibẹ.
You have no place to live.	O ko ni ipo lati gbe.
They will take enough, and that is.	Wọn yoo gba to, ati pe iyẹn ni.
It should include only the fields you really need.	O yẹ ki o pẹlu awọn aaye nikan ti o nilo gaan.
And his father.	Ati baba rẹ.
But not cars like this.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ bii eyi.
Something is on his back.	Nkankan wa lori ẹhin rẹ.
This is my newest.	Eyi ni tuntun mi.
I put in some time last night and really enjoyed the style.	Mo ti fi diẹ ninu awọn akoko ni kẹhin alẹ ati ki o gan gbadun awọn ara.
There is no reason to do so yet.	Ko si idi lati ṣe bẹ sibẹsibẹ.
All other airlines refused to operate that route.	Gbogbo awọn ọkọ ofurufu miiran kọ lati ṣiṣẹ ọna naa.
He still thought.	O si tun ro.
You can sell them for money.	O le ta wọn fun owo.
He looked around the room, but saw nothing.	O wo gbogbo yara naa, ṣugbọn ko ri nkankan.
I know the name.	Mo mọ orukọ naa.
I should be asking those questions.	Mo yẹ ki n beere awọn ibeere naa.
But who cut it is another matter.	Ṣugbọn tani ge o jẹ ọrọ miiran.
In the end, more attention is needed.	Ni ipari, akiyesi diẹ jẹ pataki.
He was in the office only a short time.	O wa ni ọfiisi nikan ni igba diẹ.
Children's books have passed through the years.	Iwe awọn ọmọde ti kọja nipasẹ awọn ọdun.
It was a winter day.	O jẹ ọjọ igba otutu.
But that is now gone.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ti lọ ni bayi.
Life is a long vacation.	Igbesi aye jẹ isinmi pipẹ kan.
Not here already.	Ko si nibi tẹlẹ.
I'll hear if you talk.	Emi yoo gbọ ti o ba ti sọrọ.
Of course I don’t expect you to work out.	Dajudaju ko nireti pe iwọ yoo ṣiṣẹ jade.
I always think and will.	Mo nigbagbogbo ro pe ati ki o yoo.
Dad thought he was talking about his daughter and his wife.	Baba ro pe o n sọrọ nipa ọmọbirin rẹ ati iyawo rẹ.
Before you say a word, you do it.	Ṣaaju ki o to sọ ọrọ kan, o ṣe ọ.
But he has a plan in place.	Ṣugbọn o ni eto ninu awọn iṣẹ.
Write that down.	Kọ iyẹn silẹ.
One of her children is a doctor.	Ọkan ninu awọn ọmọ rẹ jẹ dokita.
You look here.	O wo ibi.
However, it will.	Sibẹsibẹ, yoo ṣe.
At least not to you.	O kere kii ṣe si ọdọ rẹ.
Maybe it will.	Boya yoo ṣe.
While we were still married.	Nigba ti a si tun ni iyawo.
Tonight will be better.	Alẹ oni yoo dara.
First, think about your vacation plans.	Ni akọkọ, ronu nipa awọn eto isinmi rẹ.
The man was the only thing he knew.	Ọkunrin naa nikan ni ohun ti o mọ.
This car is almost brand new.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yii ti fẹrẹ jẹ tuntun.
Okay, let it be.	O dara, jẹ ki o.
Leave nothing.	Fi ohunkohun silẹ.
There are a lot of pitfalls in that game.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn idaniloju wa ninu ere yẹn.
It is possible.	O ṣee ṣe.
Nothing else was done about it.	Ko si ohun miiran ti a ṣe nipa rẹ.
He had a lot of hands that way.	O ni ọwọ pupọ ni ọna yẹn.
One of his daughters.	Ọkan ninu awọn ọmọbirin rẹ.
The old city has had many wonders.	Ilu atijọ ti ni ọpọlọpọ awọn iyanu.
To speak, or to feel a certain way.	Lati sọrọ, tabi lati rilara ọna kan.
That at least requires a look.	Ti o ni o kere beere a wo.
Let us consider this for a few minutes.	Jẹ ki a ro eyi fun iṣẹju diẹ.
The day is special.	Ọjọ naa ṣe pataki.
I had to get out after them.	Mo ni lati jade lẹhin wọn.
People living in small towns often drive to larger cities.	Awọn eniyan ti ngbe ni awọn ilu kekere nigbagbogbo wakọ lọ si awọn ilu nla.
So you feel really good.	Ki o ro gan ti o dara.
I just want some break through.	Mo ti o kan fẹ diẹ ninu awọn adehun nipasẹ.
I just wouldn't have thought of it.	Mo ti o kan ko yoo ti ro o.
You also have to find more words.	O tun ni lati wa awọn ọrọ diẹ sii.
I can’t believe how everything is going for you well.	Emi ko le gbagbọ bi ohun gbogbo ti n lọ fun ọ daradara.
Your no.	Rẹ ko si.
Sorry about that.	Ma binu nipa iyẹn.
Much has happened since that day.	Elo ti ṣẹlẹ lati ọjọ yẹn.
An ancient city or past history.	Ilu ti o ni atijọ tabi itan ti o ti kọja.
May I be the first to see ?.	Ṣe MO le jẹ ẹni akọkọ lati rii?.
They do not have the same values.	Wọn ko ni awọn iye kanna.
You know how much time you will spend together.	O mọ iye akoko ti iwọ yoo lo papọ.
That you can do.	Ti o le ṣe.
No one wants this thing.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o fẹ nkan yii.
There is very little agreement, however, on its purpose.	Adehun ti o kere pupọ wa, sibẹsibẹ, lori idi rẹ.
Now is the time to test your thinking.	Bayi ni akoko lati ṣe idanwo ero rẹ.
You still don’t want to let it go.	O ko tii fẹ lati jẹ ki o lọ.
The group was not very happy in the big rain.	Ẹgbẹ naa ko dun pupọ ni ojo nla.
I have to leave now.	Mo ni lati lọ kuro ni bayi.
It can help you to visit.	O le ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ lati ṣabẹwo si.
And we will leave this area.	Ati pe a yoo lọ kuro ni agbegbe yii.
He seems to have great power.	O dabi ẹni pe o ni agbara nla.
We put a lot of work into it.	A fi ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ sinu rẹ.
You will kill me again.	Iwọ yoo tun pa mi.
He left the room fast.	O kuro ni yara yara.
Again, the same thing.	Lẹẹkansi, ohun kanna.
And all of these things happen over time.	Ati pe gbogbo nkan wọnyi ṣẹlẹ lori akoko.
Over time, everyone who knows me will continue.	Ni akoko pupọ, gbogbo eniyan ti o mọ mi yoo tẹsiwaju.
But please help.	Ṣugbọn jọwọ ran.
I need to remember this more.	Mo nilo lati ranti eyi diẹ sii.
He locked the door.	O ti ilẹkun.
A room overlooking a hill is relaxing.	Yara kan ti n wo oke kan jẹ isinmi.
I'm good at something '.	Mo dara ni nkankan'.
Without it, you just can’t do it.	Laisi rẹ, o kan ko le ṣe.
We can not get it.	A ko le gba a.
You’re the wrong person.	O ni eniyan ti ko tọ.
And start to go to the side.	Ati ki o bẹrẹ lati lọ si ẹgbẹ.
The project requires a certain set of skills.	Iṣẹ naa nilo eto awọn ọgbọn kan.
He is not for you.	Oun kii ṣe fun ọ.
I was there as well.	Mo wa nibẹ bi.
Only first.	Nikan akọkọ.
My father should be in the program.	Baba mi yẹ ki o wa ninu eto naa.
What brought us to the wedding.	Ohun ti o mu wa si igbeyawo.
He was like a father who would love to have.	O dabi baba ti yoo nifẹ lati ni.
He tried to keep his thoughts to himself.	O gbiyanju lati pa awọn ero rẹ mọ ara rẹ.
One week is one week.	Ọsẹ kan jẹ ọsẹ kan.
I can't see your face.	Nko le ri oju re.
The error is not obvious.	Aṣiṣe naa ko han gbangba.
This book is hot.	Iwe yi gbona.
As he carried the heat of the sun into it.	Bi o ti gbe ooru ti oorun sinu rẹ.
To find out what happened and where.	Lati wa ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ati ibi ti o wa.
They are there.	Wọn wa nibẹ.
You can tell this to him.	O le sọ eyi fun u.
But it’s not your time, it’s not your time.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe akoko rẹ, kii ṣe akoko rẹ.
He played the best game of his life.	O ṣe ere ti o dara julọ ti igbesi aye rẹ.
I just know some things that obviously do not.	Mo kan mọ diẹ ninu awọn ohun ti o han gbangba ko ṣe.
Iron is used to make cars and boats.	A lo irin lati ṣe awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ati awọn ọkọ oju omi.
I was able to stay with everyone and everything.	Mo ni anfani lati duro pẹlu gbogbo eniyan ati ohun gbogbo.
He sat down to wait.	O joko lati duro.
I'll be back in that moment in a minute.	Emi yoo pada si akoko yẹn ni iṣẹju kan.
She has three children.	O ni awọn ọmọ mẹta.
The sister loved it.	Arabinrin naa feran.
Don't wait for me, just hurry.	Maṣe duro de mi, kan sare.
But there are at least two problems.	Ṣugbọn o kere ju awọn iṣoro meji wa.
Way to go, kids.	Ọna lati lọ, awọn ọmọde.
The weather is nice !.	Oju ojo dara!.
That's fine, you think.	Iyẹn dara, o ro.
I do not really know why.	Emi ko mo idi ti gan.
And this is not my only thought.	Ati pe eyi kii ṣe ero mi nikan.
When he reached her, he shook his head.	Nigbati o de ọdọ rẹ, o mi ori rẹ.
I am with the story.	Mo wa pẹlu itan naa.
She hurried to the small open house.	O sare lọ si ile kekere ti o ṣii.
This is wrong and wrong.	Eyi ko tọ ati pe ko tọ.
It is very good in your hand.	O dara pupọ ni ọwọ rẹ.
You love me!	O ni ife mi!
We do not force ourselves.	A ko fi agbara mu ara wa.
So now, we have both.	Nitorina bayi, a ni awọn mejeeji.
It started as a small ball.	O bẹrẹ bi bọọlu kekere kan.
If you mean to be will happen.	Ti o ba tumọ si lati jẹ yoo ṣẹlẹ.
It was his face, he thought, all in his face.	O jẹ oju rẹ, o ro, gbogbo ni oju rẹ.
I'll call you early.	Emi yoo pe ọ ni kutukutu.
You must, because it looks great.	O gbọdọ, nitori o dabi nla.
You have to make money.	O ni lati ṣe owo.
He spoke with some difficulty.	O sọrọ pẹlu iṣoro diẹ.
Give it more time.	Fun ni akoko diẹ sii.
That is what it is all about.	Ti o jẹ ohun ti o ni gbogbo nipa.
I have done that twice.	Mo ti ṣe iyẹn ni igba meji.
I will go to find him.	Emi yoo lọ lati wa a.
If you can find one.	Ti o ba le ri ọkan.
And that wasn’t his goal, he said.	Ati pe kii ṣe ipinnu rẹ, o sọ.
I am changing the device.	Mo n yi ẹrọ naa pada.
Dog stress again.	Aja wahala lẹẹkansi.
If you know a way, tell us.	Ti o ba mọ ọna kan, sọ fun wa.
Sometimes things work well, and sometimes they don’t.	Nigba miiran awọn nkan ṣiṣẹ daradara, ati nigba miiran wọn kii ṣe.
Most people believe that these problems are simple.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan gbagbọ pe awọn iṣoro wọnyi rọrun.
We all hope you do the work.	Gbogbo wa ni a nireti pe ki o ṣe iwe ṣiṣe naa.
Do something.	Se nkan.
For a new life, you probably have new clothes.	Fun igbesi aye tuntun, o ṣee ṣe pe o ni awọn aṣọ tuntun.
That's not what you say.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ohun ti o sọ.
You cannot buy this world.	O ko le ra aye yi.
They sat like that for a long minute.	Wọn joko bi iyẹn fun iṣẹju pipẹ.
I probably will not.	Mo ti jasi yoo ko.
Tomorrow morning, baby.	Ọla owurọ, ọmọ.
I do not have that.	Emi ko ni iyẹn.
The whole game takes two to three hours to complete.	Gbogbo ere gba to wakati meji si mẹta lati pari.
Most children do not have the skills they need to get into work.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde ko ni awọn ọgbọn ti wọn nilo lati wọ iṣẹ.
But we had to wait, we worked on the side.	Ṣugbọn a ni lati duro, a ṣiṣẹ lori ẹgbẹ.
Money helps, but it’s not the only thing.	Owo ṣe iranlọwọ, ṣugbọn kii ṣe ohun kan nikan.
He refuses to let her see him.	O kọ lati jẹ ki o ri i.
But he could not move.	Sugbon ko le gbe.
I need to do this for everyone.	Mo nilo lati ṣe eyi fun gbogbo eniyan.
It's in.	O wa ninu.
It was a fun day out.	O je kan fun aaye ọjọ.
No words to say.	Ko si awọn ọrọ lati sọ.
They do not know where else to look.	Wọn ko mọ ibi miiran lati wo.
Before making your decision, please state the facts.	Ṣaaju ki o to ṣe ipinnu rẹ, jọwọ gbe awọn otitọ.
See you and not be with you.	Ri ọ ati pe ko wa pẹlu rẹ.
Such a place, perhaps.	Iru ibi, boya.

I think this is true.	Mo ro pe eyi jẹ otitọ.
Three powerful words in our lives.	Awọn ọrọ mẹta ti o ni agbara pupọ ninu aye wa.
Everyone means well, but you can.	Gbogbo eniyan tumọ si daradara, ṣugbọn o le.
It is not your own anymore.	Ko jẹ ti ara rẹ mọ.
One by one they changed.	Ọkan nipa ọkan wọn yi pada.
When it happened to my brother, it happened to me too.	Nigba ti o ṣẹlẹ si arakunrin mi, o ṣẹlẹ si emi naa.
We should have that.	A yẹ ki o ni iyẹn.
Change your clothes.	Yi aṣọ rẹ pada.
They are all mothers.	Iya gbogbo won ni won.
They were told they would die.	Ti a sọ fun wọn pe wọn yoo ku.
Show yourself.	Fi ara rẹ han.
Things are not good.	Awọn nkan ko dara.
As ever bought way back.	Bi lailai ra si ọna pada.
She has a son.	O ni ọmọkunrin kan.
I don’t want that to be me.	Emi ko fẹ ki iyẹn jẹ emi.
I love the whole story.	Mo nifẹ gbogbo itan naa.
You need rest.	O nilo isinmi.
How it looks when done.	Bi o ṣe n wo nigbati o ti ṣe.
He does not like to ride this everyone's journey.	Ko nifẹ lati gun irin-ajo gbogbo eniyan yii.
We seem to have the same idea.	O dabi pe a ni imọran kanna.
I can cook.	Mo le se ounjẹ.
We want to do something about that.	A fẹ ṣe nkankan nipa iyẹn.
Maybe it wasn't so bad to have around.	Boya o je ko ki buburu lati ni ni ayika.
Again we notice a small problem.	Lẹẹkansi a ṣe akiyesi iṣoro kekere kan.
They are good with that.	Wọn dara pẹlu iyẹn.
I have done so many times.	Mo ti ṣe bẹ ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
No one will know.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo mọ.
You do your job as best you can.	O ṣe iṣẹ rẹ bi o ti le ṣe dara julọ.
You know the system.	O mọ eto naa.
Make sure you treat yourself to one of them now !.	Rii daju pe o tọju ararẹ si ọkan ninu wọn ni bayi!.
Ask yourself a simple question.	Beere ararẹ ibeere ti o rọrun kan.
We will have to figure something else out.	A yoo ni lati ro nkan miiran jade.
Not high is important.	Ko ga ni pataki.
The water level could rise this year.	Omi le ga pupọ ni ọdun yii.
Please give him our love.	Jọwọ fun u ni ifẹ wa.
I have agreed through this several times with him.	Mo ti gba nipasẹ eyi ni ọpọlọpọ igba pẹlu rẹ.
This important truth has already been seen on the road.	Otitọ pataki yii ni a ti rii tẹlẹ ni opopona.
He forced himself.	O fi agbara mu ara rẹ.
You need to ask.	O nilo lati beere.
Other things are just his job.	Awọn nkan miiran jẹ iṣẹ rẹ nikan.
Of course, it is not anything of the sort.	Dajudaju, kii ṣe ohunkohun ti iru.
But there it is, the same.	Ṣugbọn nibẹ o wa, kanna.
Believe me.	Gba mi gbọ.
We quickly forgot them.	A yara gbagbe wọn.
He would not say why.	Oun yoo ko sọ idi rẹ.
Please visit me there.	Jọwọ ṣabẹwo si mi nibẹ.
It's time to act.	O to akoko lati ṣe.
I know better now.	Mo ti mọ dara ju bayi.
No, it should not.	Rara, ko yẹ.
Try to get some attention.	Gbiyanju lati gba diẹ ninu akiyesi.
He will definitely come back.	Yoo dajudaju pada wa.
It has always worked for men.	Nigbagbogbo o ti ṣiṣẹ fun awọn ọkunrin.
People of course talk a lot.	Awọn eniyan dajudaju sọrọ pupọ.

They need to be repeated.	Wọn nilo lati tun ṣe.
The sister did not speak.	Arabinrin naa ko sọrọ.
They do not know who they are eating right now.	Wọn ko mọ ẹni ti wọn njẹ ni bayi.
The weather is nice this time of year.	Oju ojo jẹ dara julọ ni akoko ọdun yii.
It draws on the simplest things in life.	O fa lori awọn nkan ti o rọrun julọ ni igbesi aye.
You are looking for a job.	O n wa iṣẹ kan.
They can watch it on their phone.	Wọn le wo o lori foonu wọn.

He knew the way was not at all.	O mọ pe ọna kii ṣe rara.
We are what we look for.	A jẹ ohun ti a wo.
It gives you heat when you want.	O fun ọ ni ooru nigbati o ba fẹ.
The housewife among them died.	Iyawo ile ninu wọn ku.
Everything else today will be said about it.	Gbogbo ohun miiran loni ni yoo sọ nipa rẹ.
You should be home by now.	O yẹ ki o wa ni ile nipasẹ bayi.
Start working on your plans.	Bẹrẹ ṣiṣẹ lori awọn eto rẹ.
I would have liked to help you.	Emi yoo ti fẹ lati ran rẹ lọwọ.
You will leave your shoes outside.	Iwọ yoo fi bata rẹ silẹ ni ita.

For future times.	Fun ojo iwaju igba.

But it was not enough.	Sugbon o je ko to.

They know a lot about themselves.	Wọn mọ pupọ nipa ara wọn.
You want to play the game.	O fẹ ṣe ere naa.
Rain after that day.	Ojo lẹhin ọjọ ti o.

It's as fast as you can.	O sare bi o ti le.
Sleep a little, maybe some dinner.	Sun diẹ, boya diẹ ninu ounjẹ alẹ.

He has no friends here.	Ko ni awọn ọrẹ nibi.

Is that too fast?	Ṣe iyẹn yara ju?
She has two children of her own to take care of.	O ni ọmọ meji ti ara rẹ lati tọju.

Shake your head a little.	Mi ori rẹ diẹ.

He will do it himself.	Oun yoo ṣe funrararẹ.
Both are boys.	Awọn mejeeji jẹ ọmọkunrin.
I am convinced that.	O da mi loju pe.
At least, for me it does.	O kere ju, fun mi o ṣe.
Some people only walk these days.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan rin nikan ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
And a lot of people are missing out on that.	Ati pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni o padanu ninu iyẹn.
That is your reward.	Ere re niyen.
I am not one to hold books.	Emi kii ṣe ọkan lati di awọn iwe mu.
Can you write down what you said?	Ṣe o le kọ ohun ti o sọ silẹ?
I still remember it well.	Mo tun ranti rẹ daradara.
I have two little girls to take care of and everything is money.	Mo ni awọn ọmọbirin kekere meji lati tọju ati pe ohun gbogbo jẹ owo.
I can, at times, say it.	Mo le, ni igba miiran, sọ ọ.
They wore warm clothes.	Wọn wọ aṣọ ti o gbona.
But he can't wait.	Ṣugbọn ko le duro.
Everything has changed.	Ohun gbogbo ti yipada.
I remember trying to talk it out of me.	Mo ranti gbiyanju lati sọrọ rẹ jade ti mi.
I do not have to.	Emi ko ni lati.
It has nothing to do with it.	Ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
Or maybe years later.	Tabi boya ọdun lẹhin naa.
Before.	Ṣaaju ki o to.
Which made me angry.	Eyi ti o mu mi binu.
I make breakfast for the kids and walk them to school.	Mo ṣe ounjẹ owurọ fun awọn ọmọde ati rin wọn lọ si ile-iwe.
I always hit the wrong button.	Nigbagbogbo Mo lu bọtini ti ko tọ.
Finish my outfit well.	Pari aṣọ mi daradara.
I learned a lot from her.	Mo kọ ẹkọ pupọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
They have lived on this road for many years.	Wọn ti gbe ni opopona yii fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
I'm glad you accepted.	Inu mi dun pe o gba.
Something is coming back.	Nkankan n bọ pada.
You heard something.	O gbọ ohun kan.
Come and get it!.	Wa gba!.
You do not need to pull it off.	A ko nilo rẹ lati fa kuro.
He is back.	O ti pada.
So many bodies.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ awọn ara.
They know the law.	Wọn mọ ofin naa.
The same methods are continued.	Awọn ọna kanna ni a tẹsiwaju.
What is your purpose? 	Kini idi rẹ?
he asked himself.	o beere ara rẹ.
The following year, we became friends.	Ni ọdun to nbọ, a di ọrẹ.
However we now must clear up some legal points.	Sibẹsibẹ a bayi gbọdọ ko soke diẹ ninu awọn aaye ofin.
We tried that.	A gbiyanju iyẹn.
I was one of the youngest students in my class.	Mo jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ti o kere julọ ni kilasi mi.
Sure, that's great.	Daju, iyẹn dara gaan.
You can also listen to your child in another room.	O tun le gbọ ọmọ rẹ ni yara miiran.
As you live, believe in life.	Bi o ti n gbe, gbagbọ ninu igbesi aye.
Many want more time.	Ọpọlọpọ fẹ fun akoko diẹ sii.
It will break long before they let it die.	O yoo fọ ni pipẹ ṣaaju ki wọn jẹ ki o ku.
Go ahead, say.	Tẹsiwaju, sọ.
But you don’t have to wait and see.	Ṣugbọn o ko ni lati duro ati wo.
I have no idea what to expect.	Emi ko ni imọran kini lati reti.
You are thinking one way and feeling the other way.	O n ronu ọna kan ati rilara ọna miiran.
He will not kill anyone.	Oun yoo ko pa ẹnikẹni.
I'll find one.	Emi yoo ri ọkan.
Do not eat too much!	Maṣe jẹun pupọ!
No, it's better.	Rara, o dara julọ.
He is asleep.	O ti sun.
No worthy game.	Ko si ere yẹ.
The energy was restored early in the morning.	Agbara ti a pada ni kutukutu owurọ.
However, one problem is to plan.	Sibẹsibẹ, iṣoro kan ni lati gbero.
You deserve to be angry.	O tọ lati binu.
They have gone from town to town.	Wọn ti lọ lati ilu si ilu.
We all have the inner thoughts of time.	Gbogbo wa ni ero inu inu ti akoko.
I have nothing against it.	Emi ko ni nkankan si i.
No jobs, they say.	Ko si awọn iṣẹ, wọn sọ.
It made me sit up and take note.	O jẹ ki n joko si oke ati ṣe akiyesi.
He knew he was right.	O mọ pe o tọ.
It has been bought and sold three times in the past month.	O ti ra ati ta ni igba mẹta ni oṣu ti o kọja.
And that's really hard for me.	Ati pe iyẹn nira fun mi gaan.
Your hands are not beautiful.	Ọwọ rẹ kii ṣe oju lẹwa.
So who made the roads?	Nitorina tani o ṣe awọn ọna?
They will not worry about it anymore.	Wọn kii yoo ni aniyan nipa rẹ mọ.
But nothing seems to work.	Ṣugbọn ko si ohun ti o dabi pe o ṣiṣẹ.
I do not know what happened.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
I do this often.	Mo ṣe eyi nigbagbogbo.
The question is as we did.	Ibeere naa jẹ bi a ti ṣe.
None of the girls said a word.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ọmọbirin ti o sọ ọrọ kan.
The water is gone.	Omi ti lọ.
I can't seem to stop.	Emi ko le dabi lati da.
Right now, it doesn’t seem important to me.	Ni bayi, ko dabi pataki si mi.
they fell fast asleep.	oorun sun wọn gidigidi.
He said he had something he needed to talk to us about.	O sọ pe o ni nkan ti o nilo lati ba wa sọrọ nipa.
My dad gives me a driving lesson.	Baba mi n fun mi ni ẹkọ awakọ.
I can get that position today.	Mo le gba ipo yẹn loni.
One day your time will come.	Ni ọjọ kan akoko rẹ yoo wa.
Go to sleep.	Lọ sun.
You can drop it.	O le ju silẹ.
Get me a car.	Gba mi ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
He reached the edge of the garden.	O de eti ọgba.
Possibly in the car.	O ṣee ṣe ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
Do not write the song out.	Maṣe kọ orin naa jade.
I hope they all feel that way.	Mo nireti pe gbogbo wọn lero iyẹn.
I'm sure you missed it.	O da mi loju pe o padanu re.
Maybe he started in high school.	Boya o bẹrẹ ni ile-iwe giga.
Not in weeks, not in days, right now.	Kii ṣe ni awọn ọsẹ, kii ṣe ni awọn ọjọ, ni bayi.
It makes you ask things.	O mu ki o beere awọn nkan.
High and high.	Ga ati ki o ga.
One reason is that we don’t need one.	Idi kan ni pe a ko nilo ọkan.
This is my life.	Eyi ni igbesi aye mi.
They have a chance.	Won ni anfani.
However, there are ways to be around this.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn ọna wa lati wa ni ayika eyi.
The way it is about you.	Ọna ti o jẹ nipa rẹ.
He felt bad about the situation and left.	O ni rilara buburu nipa ipo naa o si lọ kuro.
Say what you need to say.	Sọ ohun ti o nilo lati sọ.
You are not invited.	A ko pe ọ.
No, that is a mistake.	Rara, iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe.
Maybe I am alone.	Boya emi nikan.
At least at first.	O kere ju ni akọkọ.
I don’t know if that will even work.	Emi ko mọ boya iyẹn yoo paapaa ṣiṣẹ.
They are worried.	Wọn ṣe aniyan.
I am on a mission.	Mo wa lori ise kan.
How could he not say.	Bawo ni ko ṣe le sọ.
It was decided that they would come together.	O ti pinnu pe wọn yoo wa papọ.
But at least think about it as we do this work.	Ṣugbọn o kere ju ronu nipa rẹ bi a ṣe n ṣe iṣẹ yii.
It was only physical for him.	O je nikan ti ara fun u.
The men were like that.	Awọn ọkunrin wà bi ti.
You see how it goes.	O wo bi o ṣe n lọ.
It seems to have changed.	O dabi ẹni pe o yipada.
I look forward to talking to you again soon.	Mo nireti lati ba ọ sọrọ lẹẹkansi laipẹ.
Something that working people can understand and comprehend.	Nkankan ti awọn eniyan ti n ṣiṣẹ le ni oye ati ni oye.
Two, maybe three years at most.	Meji, boya ọdun mẹta ni julọ.
You will meet them there.	Iwọ yoo pade wọn nibẹ.
I have expressed that thought.	Mo ti sọ ero yẹn.
The child knows that someone must have written these books.	Ọmọ naa mọ pe ẹnikan gbọdọ ti kọ awọn iwe yii.
Not by long.	Kii ṣe nipasẹ igba pipẹ.
Sure you want to miss it.	O daju pe o fẹ lati padanu rẹ.
Your cat will not get out of the room.	Ologbo rẹ ko ni jade kuro ninu yara.
My family has died into such a thing.	Idile mi ti ku sinu iru nkan bẹẹ.
Not two, not three.	Kii ṣe meji, kii ṣe mẹta.
I grew up.	Mo ti dagba.
He is a person like me.	O jẹ eniyan bi emi.
But some ask about how to pay for it.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu awọn beere nipa bi o lati san fun o.
He walked out of the office.	O jade kuro ni ọfiisi.
And you have no reason.	Ati pe o ko ni idi kan.
I do not see.	Emi ko ri.
You are looking for a good home.	O n wa ile ti o dara.
I can't start.	Emi ko le bẹrẹ.
I don’t know anyone around here.	Emi ko mọ ẹnikẹni ni ayika ibi.
I know myself.	Mo mọ ara mi.
It’s been a long day, ’he said.	O ti jẹ ọjọ pipẹ,' o sọ.
The train has blown several times.	Ọkọ oju irin naa ti fẹ ni igba pupọ.
Tomorrow something we believe as true can be a big mistake.	Ọla ohun kan ti a gbagbọ bi otitọ le jẹ aṣiṣe nla kan.
I know you, but only.	Mo mọ ọ, ṣugbọn nikan.
My energy is running fast.	Agbara mi n sare.
We will take it.	A yoo gba e.
We all have other ideas, and that.	Gbogbo wa miiran ero, ati awọn ti o.
He believes there is a reason to everything.	O gbagbọ pe idi kan wa si ohun gbogbo.
Something you can hide through time.	Nkankan ti o le tọju nipasẹ akoko.
They have not grown with us.	Wọn ko ti dagba pẹlu wa.
Ask more questions.	Beere awọn ibeere diẹ sii.
I didn’t ask much of them.	Emi ko beere pupọ lọwọ wọn.
I take a moment to look at everyone.	Mo gba akoko kan lati wo gbogbo eniyan.
This is their life.	Eyi ni aye wọn.
I don’t let my son see it.	Emi ko jẹ ki ọmọ mi wo o.
I do not want to meet them.	Emi ko fẹ lati pade wọn.
Please take a moment to think.	Jọwọ gba akoko kan lati ronu.
Really nice, go back to see them again.	Ni otitọ dara pupọ, lọ pada lati rii wọn lẹẹkansi.
Once you wake up, just your phone.	Ni kete ti o ji, o kan foonu rẹ.
It just happens to cross your path at the wrong time.	O kan ṣẹlẹ lati kọja ọna rẹ ni akoko ti ko tọ.
We need to stop and think what is happening.	A nilo lati da duro ki a ro ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
Go out and buy, now.	Jade lọ ra, ni bayi.
He didn't seem happy to be there.	Ko dabi ẹni pe inu rẹ dun lati wa nibẹ.
You may not even be a member.	O le ma jẹ ẹgbẹ paapaa.
They grew up together.	Wọn dagba papọ.
This is not one.	Eyi ko ni ọkan.
I love my country.	Mo nifẹ ilu mi.
I have noticed it for a while.	Mo ti ṣe akiyesi rẹ ni igba diẹ.
They drive it.	Wọn wakọ rẹ.
You can also write for local and regional newspapers.	O tun le kọ fun agbegbe ati agbegbe iwe iroyin.
What we heard from.	Ohun ti a gbọ lati.
You have no further agreement.	O ko ni adehun diẹ sii.
He was wondering why he did not find another.	O ti iyalẹnu idi ti o ko ri miiran.
I have a house.	Mo ni ile kan.
Do this several times a day.	Ṣe eyi ni ọpọlọpọ igba ni ọjọ kan.
That should be all.	O yẹ ki o jẹ gbogbo iyẹn.
Okay, he said it again.	O dara, o tun sọ lẹẹkansi.
They seem to have changed.	O dabi pe wọn yipada pada.
My desires are for the truth.	Awọn ifẹ mi wa fun otitọ.
Understand that now.	Loye iyẹn ni bayi.
It was this last one that caught my attention.	O jẹ ikẹhin yii ti o fa akiyesi mi.
It will not be school.	Kii yoo jẹ ile-iwe.
That's beyond me.	Iyẹn kọja mi.
Her body image is amazing.	Ara aworan rẹ jẹ iyalẹnu.
Now that would be fun !!.	Bayi ti yoo jẹ fun!!.
Who knows what happened.	Tani o mọ ohun to ṣẹlẹ.
Not the woman who looked away.	Ko obinrin ti o wo kuro.
With us today this is a big problem.	Pẹlu wa loni eyi ni iṣoro nla.
That’s what you need to hear.	Iyẹn jẹ ohun ti o nilo lati gbọ.
We start to find something really interesting here.	A bẹrẹ lati ri nkankan gan awon nibi.
But he knew that was not the reason he stopped.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe kii ṣe idi ti o fi duro.
It’s not that you have a lot to start with.	Kii ṣe pe o ni pupọ lati bẹrẹ pẹlu.
But he was not afraid of that.	Ṣugbọn ko bẹru iyẹn.
And if they want to get rid of this, they will need us.	Ati pe ti wọn ba fẹ mu eyi kuro, wọn yoo nilo wa.
There is no way around it.	Ko si ọna ni ayika rẹ.
Think you have to ask them.	Ro pe o ni lati beere lọwọ wọn.
I will paint.	Emi yoo kun mi.
They begin to fall in love with each other.	Wọn bẹrẹ ni ifẹ pẹlu ara wọn.
Materials are not enough.	Awọn nkan elo ko to mọ.
You know who is calling on the phone.	O mọ ẹniti o pe lori foonu.
I saw it for the first time.	Mo ti ri i fun igba akọkọ.
But it is too late.	Sugbon o ti pẹ ju.
Students write down its details.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe kọ awọn alaye rẹ.
There is nothing there.	Ko si nkankan nibẹ.
Not many people sell.	Ko ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan ta.
You must have that position.	O gbọdọ ni ipo yẹn.
It is what we do.	O jẹ ohun ti a ṣe.
Some good, some not.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti o dara, diẹ ninu awọn ti o ko.
No time to think about it.	Ko si akoko lati ronu nipa rẹ.
I sit to the side.	Mo joko si ẹgbẹ.
Do not be angry with them.	Maṣe binu wọn.
They are all married and doing well.	Gbogbo wọn ti ṣe igbeyawo ati pe wọn n ṣe daradara.
For them, they are visiting you.	Fun wọn, wọn n ṣabẹwo si ọ.
I think he left me in that.	Mo ro pe o fi mi silẹ ninu iyẹn.
Often, the best method is not the most obvious one.	Nigbagbogbo, ọna ti o dara julọ kii ṣe ọkan ti o han julọ.
One way to reach it.	Ọna kan lati de ọdọ rẹ.
I am very tired.	O rẹ mi pupọ.
It is a treat.	O jẹ adehun.
He ate his meal, not his.	O jẹun ounjẹ rẹ, ko jẹ.
It will not be easy.	Kii yoo rọrun.
The rain stopped and the sun came out.	Ojo duro ati oorun jade.
These shoes are really nice.	Awọn bata wọnyi dara gaan.
You will leave this house, and you will never return.	O yoo kuro ni ile yi, ati awọn ti o yoo ko pada.
However, they are not the same thing.	Sibẹsibẹ, wọn kii ṣe ohun kanna.
School rules came and went.	Awọn ofin ile-iwe wa o si lọ.
I can't stay home.	Emi ko le duro ni ile.
I could not understand why he was so afraid.	Emi ko le loye idi ti o fi bẹru pupọ.
So now you can think of one.	Nitorina bayi o le ronu ọkan.
This is a family home.	Eleyi jẹ a ebi ile.
Thus because of the decisions made they all died.	Bayi nitori awọn ipinnu ti a ṣe gbogbo wọn ku.
And of course we are.	Ati pe dajudaju a wa.
I should know that they will see me again.	Mo yẹ ki o mọ pe wọn yoo tun ri mi lẹẹkansi.
Company and service moved to local communities.	Ile-iṣẹ ati iṣẹ ti a gbe lọ si awọn agbegbe agbegbe.
Friend for the work you have done on this project.	Ọrẹ fun iṣẹ ti o ti ṣe lori iṣẹ yii.
Her body is beautiful, but not beautiful.	Ara rẹ lẹwa, ṣugbọn ko lẹwa.
You remember me.	O ranti mi.
She likes it very much this way.	O fẹran rẹ dara julọ ni ọna yii.
Learn how to love back.	Kọ ẹkọ bi o ṣe le nifẹ pada.
I will listen.	Emi yoo gbọ.
We played well on it.	A ṣe ere daradara lori rẹ.
Thoughts of more than one verse at a time.	Awọn ero diẹ sii ju ẹsẹ kan lọ ni akoko kan.
He would never believe it, but he was his favorite child.	Oun kii yoo gbagbọ rara, ṣugbọn o jẹ ọmọ ayanfẹ rẹ.
His head no longer felt.	Ori re ko ro mo.
Nothing else can be thought of.	Ohunkohun miiran ko ṣee ro.
Do not put it on yourself.	Maṣe fi si ara rẹ.
You are the one who loves her.	Iwọ ni ẹniti o fẹ rẹ.
I knew it would be small.	Mo mọ pe yoo jẹ kekere.
We think this is a very difficult question.	A ro pe eyi jẹ ibeere ti o nira pupọ.
It will only take a few small words.	Yoo gba awọn ọrọ kekere diẹ nikan.
I have lived all my life.	Mo ti gbe nibi gbogbo aye mi.
And those little hands.	Ati awọn ọwọ kekere kekere yẹn.
To be human.	Lati jẹ eniyan.
Okay, right.	O dara, o tọ.
He brought what he needed.	O mu ohun ti o nilo.
No one wants it.	Ko si ẹniti o fẹ rẹ.
The car went off the highway.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa lọ si ọna opopona.
To go to places and meet.	Lati lọ si awọn aaye ati pade.
Glad that his journey ended soon.	O dun pe irin-ajo rẹ pari laipẹ.
We have a lot to do.	A ni ọpọlọpọ lati ṣe.
Let me tell you it doesn't work.	Jẹ ki n sọ fun ọ pe ko ṣiṣẹ.
He returned to the position standing in front of him.	O pada si ipo ti o duro ni iwaju rẹ.
Tell your friends about it !.	Sọ fun awọn ọrẹ rẹ nipa rẹ!.
But at the very least, it means the details are important.	Ṣugbọn o kere ju, o tumọ si pe awọn alaye ṣe pataki.
Is recognized in the pictures.	Ti wa ni mọ ninu awọn aworan.
They don’t seem to notice it.	Wọn ko dabi ẹni pe wọn ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
This type of machine is used to make clothes.	Iru ẹrọ yii ni a lo lati ṣe awọn aṣọ.
If it works, it works.	Ti o ba ṣiṣẹ, o ṣiṣẹ.
So you want to know that you have a little anxiety.	Nitorina o fẹ ki o mọ pe o ni aniyan kekere kan.
We will not do anything in public that.	A kii yoo ṣe ohunkohun ni gbangba iyẹn.
I want that kind of life.	Mo fẹ iru igbesi aye yẹn.
You’re not going to catch him.	O ko lilọ si mu u.
I need everyone doing their job.	Mo nilo gbogbo eniyan n ṣe iṣẹ wọn.
Use when you have to.	Lo nigbati o ba ni lati.
It’s worth what you can get.	O tọ ohun ti o le gba.
Others like more at a time.	Awọn miiran fẹran diẹ ni akoko kan.
I have something to look at.	Mo ni nkan ti o yẹ ki o wo.
He spoke into it.	O sọrọ sinu rẹ.
He almost fell asleep.	O fẹrẹ sun.
He was asleep alone.	O ti sun nikan.
This is very important, for two reasons.	Eyi ṣe pataki ni pataki, fun awọn idi meji.
I'm not sure if it will.	Emi ko da mi loju boya yoo ṣe.
His eyes and ears are everywhere, we are told.	Oju ati eti re wa nibi gbogbo, a sọ fun wa.
Your report is very accurate.	Iroyin rẹ jẹ otitọ julọ.
It is not the most credible way to kill yourself.	Kii ṣe ọna ti o gbagbọ julọ lati pa ararẹ.
It will come back on the family.	Yoo pada wa lori idile.
Serious questions, please.	Jọwọ, awọn ibeere to ṣe pataki.
But his eyes did not cross two tables.	Ṣugbọn oju rẹ ko kọja tabili meji.
These foods are made together.	Awọn ounjẹ wọnyi ni a ṣe papọ.
This area has very hot summers.	Agbegbe yii ni awọn igba ooru ti o gbona pupọ.
It happened with me a lot.	O ṣẹlẹ pẹlu mi pupọ.
Maybe for you, you can.	Boya fun o, o le.
Let's go there.	Jẹ ki a lọ nibẹ.
He wants to talk to you.	O fẹ lati ba ọ sọrọ.
Didn't find it.	Ko ri i.
Before his path changed.	Ṣaaju ki ọna rẹ yipada.
You can even walk.	O le paapaa rin.
I grew up here and this is my home.	Mo dagba nibi ati eyi ni ile mi.
I'm really good at this.	Mo n dara gaan ni eyi.
It can work both ways.	O le ṣiṣẹ awọn ọna mejeeji.
He did not know what he was looking for until he found it.	Ko mọ ohun ti o n wa titi o fi ri i.
The law has little power over it.	Ofin ko ni agbara diẹ lori rẹ.
You must have known that we have no money.	O gbọdọ ti mọ pe a ko ni owo.
No news.	Ko si iroyin.
You have to know.	O ni lati mọ.
A big little one.	Nla kekere kan.
I have played this game many times.	Mo ti ṣe ere yii ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
It’s been years and years.	O ni ọdun ati ọdun.
Maybe you want to try something else.	Boya o fẹ gbiyanju nkan miiran.
However that was once to not be.	Sibẹsibẹ ti o wà ni kete ti lati ko ni le.
It would be so nice.	Yoo dara julọ bẹ.
She came from my place for dinner.	O wa lati aaye mi fun ounjẹ alẹ.
It’s not that he didn’t try.	Kii ṣe pe ko gbiyanju.
However it is not an easy task.	Sibẹsibẹ kii ṣe iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
But you can’t just show up at your house at this hour.	Ṣugbọn o ko le kan han ni ile rẹ ni wakati yii.
You can say that.	O le sọ iyẹn.
They pay attention to their home situation.	Wọn ṣe akiyesi si ipo ile wọn.
It’s not that you can do a lot.	Kii ṣe pe o le ṣe pupọ.
You don't see it.	O ko wo o.
Out on one leg.	Jade lori ẹsẹ kan.
He also has that face.	O tun ni oju yẹn.
He took off his shoes and crossed his legs.	O yọ bata rẹ kuro o si kọja awọn ẹsẹ rẹ.
Don't try to let me see anything again.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati jẹ ki n ri ohunkohun lẹẹkansi.
Some people wear special clothes.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan wọ aṣọ ti o ṣe pataki.
You can be in the same boat.	O le wa ninu ọkọ oju omi kanna.
You will not stop now.	Iwọ kii yoo da duro ni bayi.
Can not.	Ko le.
Just so and.	O kan bẹ ati.
But for now, it makes me happy.	Ṣugbọn ni bayi, o jẹ ki inu mi dun.
And yet they pull away.	Ati sibẹsibẹ wọn fa kuro.
Any child can talk.	Eyikeyi ọmọ le sọrọ.
Many things can happen at this point.	Awọn nkan pupọ le ṣẹlẹ ni aaye yii.
I wouldn’t expect many problems here.	Emi kii yoo nireti ọpọlọpọ awọn iṣoro nibi.
They experiment with new methods.	Wọn ṣe idanwo pẹlu awọn ọna tuntun.
Let it stand.	Jẹ ki o duro.
I like it.	Mo fẹran rẹ.
Before you walk back to your car.	Ṣaaju ki o to rin pada si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ.
If not it will be.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ yoo jẹ.
Let’s not even talk about today’s weather.	Jẹ ki a ko paapaa sọrọ nipa oju ojo oni.
Today has been a mistake, a big one.	Loni ti jẹ aṣiṣe, nla kan.
To one of them.	Si ọkan ninu wọn.
You can't believe what you hear.	O ko le gbagbọ ohun ti o gbọ.
This, however, by the way.	Eyi, sibẹsibẹ, nipasẹ ọna.
You think it's good to be there.	O ro pe o dara lati wa nibẹ.
The men were hard at work.	Awọn ọkunrin wà lile ni iṣẹ.
And a child in the back.	Ati ọmọde kan ni ẹhin.
I hate working with it.	Mo korira ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
His eyes never left him.	Oju rẹ ko fi i silẹ.
It will not work forever.	Kii yoo ṣiṣẹ lailai.
Just get to know them.	Kan gba lati mọ wọn.
Not finished.	Ko pari.
You don't like it, he said.	O ko fẹran rẹ, o sọ.
They live but they do not live, they only die.	Wọn n gbe ṣugbọn wọn ko wa laaye, wọn nikan ku.
Let me try.	Jẹ ki n gbiyanju.
I think it was a very good thing.	Mo ro pe o jẹ ohun ti o dara pupọ.
He could not sleep last night.	Ko le sun ni alẹ ana.
I have what we need.	Mo ni ohun ti a nilo.
Some communities may, and some may not have that facility.	Diẹ ninu awọn agbegbe le, ati diẹ ninu awọn ko ni ohun elo yẹn.

I have not changed.	Emi ko yipada.
There is no appropriate key.	Ko si bọtini yẹ.
He came to me.	O wa si mi.
Parents meet the teacher.	Awọn obi pade olukọ.
All they have to do is tell the story.	Gbogbo ohun ti wọn ni lati ṣe ni sọ itan naa.
You have explained a lot about that.	O ti ṣe alaye pupọ nipa iyẹn.
They are not into that.	Wọn ko sinu iyẹn.
We just know whether it works or not.	A o kan mọ boya o ṣiṣẹ tabi ko.
Take the train.	Gba ọkọ oju irin.
With no drop.	Pẹlu ko si silẹ.
You will have to make sure soon.	Iwọ yoo ti rii daju laipẹ.
But this is not enough.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko to.
The same thing applies here.	Ohun kanna ni nibi.
That is a definite question you need to ask yourself.	Iyẹn jẹ ibeere ti o dajudaju o nilo lati beere lọwọ ararẹ.
I'm trying to help.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
He picked it up in surprise.	O gbe e soke ni iyalẹnu.

The sister did not know whether things would change any when her body was good.	Arabinrin ko mọ boya awọn nkan yoo yipada eyikeyi nigbati ara rẹ ba dara.
But wait, there are more as they say.	Ṣugbọn duro, diẹ sii wa bi wọn ṣe sọ.
He missed it.	O padanu rẹ.
I need such a device.	Mo nilo iru ẹrọ naa.
They can do what they want.	Wọn le ṣe ohun ti wọn fẹ.
To cross, one has to be there.	Lati kọja, ọkan ni lati wa nibẹ.

This is not from the main store.	Eyi kii ṣe lati ile itaja akọkọ.
I told him that last year and the year before.	Mo sọ fun u pe ni ọdun to kọja ati ọdun ṣaaju.
That changed soon.	Iyẹn yipada laipẹ.
The tracks in the games are as follows.	Awọn orin to wa ninu awọn ere ni o wa bi wọnyi.
The word caught him.	Ọrọ naa mu u.
They are here.	Wọn wa nibi.
We are the only ones in the world.	A nikan ni aye.
However, this idea is often shown in the book.	Sibẹsibẹ, imọran yii nigbagbogbo han ninu iwe naa.
I am not in a position to stop it.	Emi ko wa ni ipo ti o yẹ lati da a duro.
But at least they came together again, forever.	Ṣugbọn o kere ju wọn wa papọ lẹẹkansi, lailai.
The men went to find a home for their families.	Awọn ọkunrin naa lọ lati wa ile fun awọn idile wọn.
Try to say it, the same agreement.	Gbiyanju lati so o, adehun kanna.
The men found it not hot enough.	Awọn ọkunrin naa rii pe ko gbona to.
He came to my house and asked the following questions.	O wa si ile mi ki o beere awọn ibeere wọnyi.
You know me and something in me knows you.	O mọ mi ati nkan ti o wa ninu mi mọ ọ.
Stop and listen in the best possible way.	Duro ati ki o gbọ ni ọna ti o dara julọ.
They will arrive at the destination soon.	Wọn yoo de aaye awọn nkan laipẹ.
You go into this program.	O lọ sinu eto yii.
This is an important situation.	Eyi jẹ ipo pataki kan.
You have to be there.	O ni lati wa nibẹ.
You are not allowed to do that.	O ko gba ọ laaye lati ṣe iyẹn.
They agreed to look at the whole book.	Wọn gba lati wo gbogbo iwe naa.
He went back to get the stolen money back.	O pada lọ gba owo ti o ji naa pada.
Feeling how the word sounds and feels.	Rilara bawo ni ọrọ naa ṣe n dun ati rilara.
The room is full of office.	Yara naa kun fun ile-iṣẹ.
You have no idea what that means to me.	O ko ni imọran kini iyẹn tumọ si mi.
The importance of those companies cannot be overstated.	Pataki ti awọn ile-iṣẹ yẹn ko le ṣe akiyesi.
Things have arrived where they live.	Awọn nkan ti de ibi ti wọn gbe.
Once lost, it will never be recovered.	Ni kete ti o padanu, kii yoo tun gba pada.
It is outside itself.	O wa ni ita funrararẹ.
You have done very well.	O ti ṣe daradara pupọ.
This has never happened before.	Eyi ko tii ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
I find it worth reading.	Mo rii pe o tọ lati ka.
I want to get them home in an unexpected way.	Mo fẹ lati gba wọn ile ni ọna ti a ko reti.
And we will do it soon.	Ati pe a yoo ṣe ni kete.
We get it right.	A gba o tọ.
Well, some of them are.	O dara, diẹ ninu wọn jẹ.
When you change your energy, you change your life.	Nigbati o ba yi agbara rẹ pada, o yi igbesi aye rẹ pada.
The celebration attracted a lot of people.	Ayẹyẹ naa fa ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
At least that's what we found.	O kere ju eyi ni ohun ti a rii.
It has gotten really pretty.	O ti gba lẹwa gan.
He said he knew.	O sọ pe o mọ.
We know that this day will come.	A mọ pe ọjọ yii yoo wa.
They will pass.	Wọn yoo kọja.
That is why it is here.	Ti o ni idi ti o wa nibi.
However, as time went on, no one heard anything more.	Sibẹsibẹ, bi akoko ti kọja, ko si ẹnikan ti o gbọ ohunkohun diẹ sii.
We were alone in the room.	A wà nikan ninu yara.
However we did not do it enough as expected.	Sibẹsibẹ a ko ṣe o fẹrẹ to bi o ti yẹ.
Completely on my own.	Patapata lori ara mi.
So they did.	Nitorina wọn ṣe.
These things happen.	Nkan wọnyi ṣẹlẹ.
The law remains the same today.	Ofin si maa wa kanna loni.
I know for sure there is something more to our story.	Mo mọ daju pe nkan kan wa diẹ sii si itan wa.
We will have a wonderful time.	A yoo ni akoko iyanu.
But he was here, not going home.	Ṣugbọn o wa nibi, ko lọ si ile.
I am in love.	Mo nifẹ.
Just say she is a missing girl and we are looking for information.	Kan sọ pe o jẹ ọmọbirin ti o padanu ati pe a n wa alaye.
You are waiting for me to make this better.	O n duro de mi lati jẹ ki eyi dara julọ.
You will not find the key in this life.	Iwọ kii yoo rii bọtini ni igbesi aye yii.
Who loves water?	Tani o nifẹ omi?
This did not happen.	Eyi ko ṣẹlẹ.
Another world is possible.	Aye miiran ṣee ṣe.
So we can lose people.	Nitorina a le padanu eniyan.
Have a long sleep.	Ni sun oorun gun.
I hope you enjoy them !.	Mo nireti pe o gbadun wọn!.
Clean your room!	Nu yara rẹ mọ!
That moment is important.	Akoko naa ṣe pataki.
They can’t do this in class, there isn’t enough time.	Wọn ko le ṣe eyi ni kilasi, ko si akoko to.
I say the time is now.	Mo sọ pe akoko jẹ bayi.
Not today.	Kii ṣe loni.
Without even having to open the front door to your home.	Laisi paapaa ni lati ṣii ilẹkun iwaju si ile rẹ.
Where they are now, you wonder.	Nibo ni wọn wa bayi, o ṣe iyalẹnu.
It may be your imagination.	O le jẹ oju inu rẹ.
We do not know much about his life.	A ko mọ pupọ nipa igbesi aye rẹ.
In most cases you will not need to touch this.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba iwọ kii yoo nilo lati fi ọwọ kan eyi.
No, there are no books after that.	Rara, ko si awọn iwe lẹhin eyi.
You come from a good family.	O wa lati kan ti o dara ebi.
You want to pass through.	O fẹ ṣe nipasẹ.
I have found that many people keep themselves.	Mo ti rii pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan pa ara wọn mọ.
She needs to be with him, to help him.	O nilo lati wa pẹlu rẹ, lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
And this is the same thing.	Ati pe eyi jẹ ohun kanna.
I did this completely.	Mo ṣe eyi patapata.
That is, what makes me happy are the things.	Iyẹn ni, ohun ti o mu inu mi dun ni awọn nkan.
You want that very much.	O fẹ iyẹn pupọ.
I like to eat in two ways.	Mo nifẹ lati jẹun ni ọna meji.
But there you know what they do.	Ṣugbọn nibẹ ni o mọ ohun ti wọn ṣe.
Can be used to help.	Le ṣee lo lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
Of course they do not sell us.	Dajudaju wọn ko ta wa.
He lifted himself up on it.	O gbe ara rẹ soke lori rẹ.
This money should only be used for this purpose.	Owo yi ni lati lo fun idi eyi nikan.
By the time this happened, things had changed.	Ni akoko ti eyi ṣẹlẹ, awọn nkan yipada.
And it is a very good thing that it should be so.	Ati pe o jẹ ohun ti o dara pupọ pe o yẹ ki o jẹ bẹ.
You will need them.	Iwọ yoo nilo wọn.
You know love.	O mọ ifẹ.
As you can see now.	Bi o ti ri ni bayi.
Find out.	Wa oke.
I wasn’t that thing, no.	Emi ko jẹ nkan yẹn, rara.
Go again.	Tun lọ tun.
And that should be it.	Ati pe iyẹn yẹ ki o jẹ iyẹn.
The present is great.	Awọn bayi jẹ nla.
That is him now.	Iyẹn ni oun ni bayi.
I enjoy doing things.	Mo gbadun ṣiṣe awọn nkan.
They are working in the city now.	Wọn ti n ṣiṣẹ ni ilu bayi.
You have work to do.	O ni iṣẹ lati ṣe.
He looked me up.	O wo mi soke.
But they have never seen anything like it before.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko tii ri iru eyi tẹlẹ.
He too is gone.	Oun naa ti lọ.
You can not believe that you have won through them.	O ko le gbagbọ pe o ti gba nipasẹ wọn.
He can't hide himself now.	Ko le pa ara rẹ mọ ni bayi.
It remains to be seen whether the program will work.	O wa lati rii boya eto naa yoo ṣiṣẹ.
And nothing else.	Ati pe ko ni nkan miiran.
He was the first to receive the gift.	Oun ni ẹni akọkọ ti o gba ẹbun naa.
It changed my mind.	O yi ero ifẹ mi pada.
Cost is another.	Iye owo jẹ miiran.
Listen to personal truth.	Gbọ otitọ ti ara ẹni.
There was no one nearby to help him.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa nitosi lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
Now everything is alive to me.	Bayi ohun gbogbo di laaye si mi.
The family has to move on.	Idile ni lati tẹsiwaju.
No one knows what to expect.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ kini lati reti.
However, it is possible to put the game together.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ṣee ṣe lati fi ere naa papọ.
But it was not by me, who lost for words.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe nipasẹ mi, ẹniti o padanu fun awọn ọrọ.
That's not the point anymore.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ọrọ naa mọ.
And we just sat there.	Ati pe a kan joko nibẹ.
I do not want to see him do that.	Emi ko fẹ lati ri i ṣe bẹ.
She loves her father to herself.	O fẹ baba rẹ si ara rẹ.
Written history.	Itan ti a kọ.
I'll be with you, if that's what you want.	Emi yoo wa pẹlu rẹ, ti o ba jẹ ohun ti o fẹ.
People died and they never came back.	Eniyan ku ati pe wọn ko pada wa.
You can drink.	O le mu.
The boy did not know what to say.	Ọmọkunrin naa ko mọ ohun ti yoo sọ.
You’re getting all this wrong.	O n gba gbogbo eyi ni aṣiṣe.
I have no idea what to do.	Emi ko ni imọran kini lati ṣe.
No, you are not.	Rara, iwọ kii ṣe.
From where we are, we cannot see why.	Lati ibiti a wa, a ko le rii idi rẹ.
It looks like he has built a house.	O dabi ẹni pe o ti ṣe ile kan.
You need rest.	O nilo isinmi.
It may or may not work.	O le ṣiṣẹ ati pe o le ma ṣiṣẹ.
I saw one, not alive, and I saw two.	Mo ri ọkan, kii ṣe laaye, o si ri meji.
I did not do this thing.	Emi ko ṣe nkan yii.
He must have been one of his fathers.	O gbọdọ jẹ ọkan ninu awọn baba rẹ.
Is there.	O wa nibẹ.
No one outside my family knew.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa ni ita idile mi ti o mọ.
They will see you.	Wọn yoo ri ọ.
Probably a very small thing.	O ṣee ṣe nkan ti o kere pupọ.
You want your mouth everywhere, not just on your own.	O fẹ ẹnu rẹ nibi gbogbo, kii ṣe lori tirẹ nikan.
Not my type.	Kii ṣe iru mi.
But let's wait.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki a duro.
Years have passed.	Awọn ọdun ti kọja.
Let out the sea.	Jẹ ki jade okun.
The decision is not made by yourself.	Ipinnu ko ṣe funrararẹ.
My husband said that my gift was not made on time.	Ọkọ mi sọ pe ẹbun mi ko ṣe ni akoko.
I need to try harder.	Mo nilo lati gbiyanju le.
He also lifted my heart today.	O tun gbe ọkan mi soke loni.
Try with this.	Gbiyanju pẹlu eyi.
I happen to agree with him.	Mo ṣẹlẹ lati gba pẹlu rẹ.
You know the side of the bed is yours.	O mọ ẹgbẹ ti ibusun naa jẹ tirẹ.
The clothing industry is important in this area.	Ile-iṣẹ aṣọ jẹ pataki ni agbegbe yii.
Here is the key.	Nibi da bọtini.
You will need that now.	Iwọ yoo nilo iyẹn ni bayi.
It was their last job.	O jẹ iṣẹ ikẹhin wọn.
In other words, they have power.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, wọn ni agbara.
Everyone is nearby here.	Gbogbo eniyan wa nitosi nibi.
It may have been too late.	O le ti jẹ ki o pẹ pupọ.
He read many books.	O ka ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe.
I am your best friend.	Emi ni ọrẹ rẹ ti o dara pupọ.
He was arrested outside his home.	Ti mu u ni ita ile rẹ.
I want to see you.	Mo fe ri e.
He didn’t want to see that happen again.	Ko fẹ lati rii pe iyẹn tun ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
We have tried to make them as few as possible.	A ti gbiyanju lati ṣe wọn bi diẹ bi o ti ṣee.
He pulled her away and called the police.	O fa a kuro o si pe ọlọpa.
This is a lot.	Eyi jẹ pupọ.
Sure.	O daju pe.
I am here for one reason and one reason only.	Mo wa nibi fun idi kan ati idi kan nikan.
I asked the man in the car about it.	Mo beere lọwọ ọkunrin ti o wa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ nipa rẹ.
I don’t think it will pull through.	Emi ko ro pe o yoo fa nipasẹ.
He received a letter from a friend.	O gba lẹta kan nipasẹ ọrẹ kan.
I can no longer get the obvious.	Emi ko tun le gba ohun ti o han gbangba.
But right now, he likes what other people in the house do.	Ṣugbọn ni bayi, o fẹran ohun ti awọn eniyan miiran ninu ile.
It picks up all the time.	O n gbe soke ni gbogbo igba.
Mother has a house.	Iya ni ile kan.
There are books about that.	Awọn iwe wa nipa iyẹn.
But, detailed information.	Ṣugbọn, awọn alaye alaye.
Do not make people around the boy.	Maṣe ṣe awọn eniyan ni ayika ọmọkunrin naa.
I would like to know about this idea and the specific reasons.	Emi yoo fẹ lati mọ nipa ero yii ati awọn idi ti o kan.
Forget what you think the first month will look like.	Gbagbe ohun ti o ro pe oṣu akọkọ yoo dabi.
It makes me think.	O jẹ ki n ronu.
You will not be able to help your friends.	Iwọ kii yoo ni anfani lati ran awọn ọrẹ rẹ lọwọ.
Which is interesting to me.	Eyi ti o nifẹ si mi.
After a long summer together, they decided to leave.	Lẹhin igba ooru ti o lo papọ, wọn pinnu lati lọ kuro.
I mean, essentially.	Mo tumọ si, ni pataki.
There is a reason in it too.	Idi wa ninu rẹ paapaa.
You like that.	O fẹran iyẹn.
A tall man walks into the room.	Ọkunrin giga kan rin sinu yara naa.
We have a week together.	A ni ọsẹ kan papọ.
It is fixed.	O ti wa titi.
Let me call the police.	Jẹ ki n pe ọlọpa.
For what you want most.	Fun ohun ti o fẹ julọ.
Strength is very important for this.	Agbara jẹ pataki julọ fun eyi.
Nothing she loves very much.	Ko si ohun ti o nifẹ pupọ.
The lesson.	Ẹkọ naa.
To love is to die or be killed, it is possible.	Lati nifẹ ni lati ku tabi pa, o ṣee ṣe.
And when he met her.	Ati nigba ti o pade rẹ.
You know he didn’t take you out there.	O mọ pe ko mu ọ jade nibẹ.
I sat there for hours every morning.	Mo ti joko nibẹ fun wakati gbogbo owurọ.
That starts at the right place.	Iyẹn bẹrẹ ni aaye ti o tọ.
It has nothing to do with them.	Ko ṣe nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu wọn.
And that’s not a good thing to do these days.	Ati pe kii ṣe ohun ti o dara lati ṣe ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
Sometimes these people are our friends.	Nigba miiran awọn eniyan wọnyi jẹ ọrẹ wa.
It was the right thing to do.	O jẹ ohun ti o tọ lati ṣe.
He picked up the phone and started talking.	O gbe foonu naa o bẹrẹ si sọrọ.
He would have loved it that way.	Oun yoo ti fẹran rẹ ni ọna yẹn.
We only have a small car.	A ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kekere kan nikan.
Many students drive home from school with their parents.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe wakọ ile lati ile-iwe pẹlu awọn obi wọn.
Her new look gives her a new life.	Oju tuntun rẹ n fun u ni igbesi aye tuntun.
He seemed to be lost to the world.	O dabi enipe o padanu si aye.
If a field opens, you will be contacted.	Ti aaye kan ba ṣii, iwọ yoo kan si.
He thought he was sure he was dead.	O ro pe o daju pe o ku.
And we will take you out to lunch.	Ati pe a yoo mu ọ jade lọ si ounjẹ ọsan.
I think this would be great.	Mo ro pe eyi yoo jẹ nla.
There is no way that it will work best for everyone.	Ko si ọna kan ti yoo ṣiṣẹ ti o dara julọ fun gbogbo eniyan.
Small accidents, maybe, but they feel special to me.	Awọn ijamba kekere, boya, ṣugbọn wọn lero pataki si mi.
It did a great job and it was fast.	O ṣe iṣẹ nla ati pe o yara.
We have to show that.	A gbọdọ fi iyẹn han.
They must have given him off.	Wọn gbọdọ ti fun u pa.
That’s an explanation, at least.	Iyẹn jẹ alaye kan, o kere ju.
It is not a beautiful picture.	Kii ṣe aworan lẹwa.
There is no other like it.	Ko si miiran bi rẹ.
It has opened everything up to everyone else.	O ti ṣii ohun gbogbo fun gbogbo eniyan miiran.
Or try to.	Tabi gbiyanju lati.
Of course again he saw what he did for us.	Dajudaju lẹẹkansi o ri ohun ti o ṣe fun wa.
It gives them importance.	O fun wọn ni pataki.
He obviously loves it too.	O han pe o fẹran rẹ paapaa.
That is why it is here.	Ti o ni idi ti o wa nibi.
I have a plan.	Mo ni eto.
He will work with.	Oun yoo ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
Image changed.	Aworan yi pada.
The method used is very simple.	Ọna ti a lo jẹ rọrun pupọ.
He closed his eyes.	O di oju rẹ.
It was so small.	O je ki kekere.
I am in great trouble.	Mo wa ninu wahala nla.
Take out my friends.	Mu awọn ọrẹ mi jade.
I spoke to the man on the phone last night.	Mo ba ọkunrin naa sọrọ lori foonu ni alẹ ana.
However, this is enough for our purpose.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi to fun idi wa.
You will not see them.	O ko ni wo wọn.
You see a box full of money.	O ri apoti ti o kun fun owo.
I can’t stay here when they are.	Emi ko le duro nibi nigbati wọn wa.
Or maybe it is this.	Tabi boya o jẹ eyi.
He seems to be a child again.	O dabi pe o jẹ ọmọ lẹẹkansi.
The problem arose when they tried to call.	Iṣoro naa dide nigbati wọn gbiyanju lati pe.
We will talk to this girl.	A yoo sọrọ si ọmọbirin yii.
The methods did not work well.	Awọn ọna naa ko ṣe daradara.
Her brother is her son.	Arakunrin rẹ ni ọmọ rẹ.
But it sounds too fast.	Sugbon o dun ju sare.
He did not let them do this to him.	O ko jẹ ki wọn ṣe eyi si i.
Ask them questions.	Beere wọn ibeere.
But you can't think of such a thing.	Ṣugbọn o ko le ronu iru nkan bẹẹ.
However, not for.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko fun.
Convinced, we cannot know when it arose.	Ni idaniloju, a ko le mọ igba ti o dide.
Of a man who decided to move.	Ti ọkunrin kan ti o pinnu lati gbe.
He was a great driver.	O jẹ awakọ nla kan.
And don’t get away with it.	Ko si gba kuro pẹlu rẹ.
We have worked all the tests we have.	A ti ṣiṣẹ gbogbo idanwo ti a ni.
Fortunately, it was almost time to leave.	O da, o fẹrẹ to akoko lati lọ kuro.
There is no single person.	Ko si ọkan nikan eniyan.
But there are other hands at work.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọwọ miiran wa ni iṣẹ.
But this will work.	Ṣugbọn eyi yoo ṣiṣẹ.
I hate this about myself.	Mo korira eyi nipa ara mi.
It will take some time.	Yoo gba igba diẹ.
You, with room to stop.	Iwọ, pẹlu yara lati da.
No wife to help.	Ko si iyawo lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
I am not happy about this program.	Inu mi ko dun nipa eto yii.
To raise my child.	Lati gbe ọmọ mi.
I can hear now.	Mo le gbọ bayi.
We do not need the space we have now.	A ko nilo aaye ti a ni ni bayi.
I try to improve things.	Mo gbiyanju lati mu awọn nkan dara.
But don’t try too hard.	Ṣugbọn ko gbiyanju pupọ.
I use it often.	Mo lo o nigbagbogbo.
I just need your ability to get this.	Mo kan nilo agbara rẹ lati gba eyi.
It was the same everywhere.	O je kanna nibi gbogbo.
Just tell me.	Kan so fun mi.
They are like dogs.	Wọn dabi aja.
It means a lot to me.	O tumọ si pupọ fun mi.
Everyone says so.	Gbogbo eniyan sọ bẹ.
It can happen here.	O le ṣẹlẹ nibi.
But it went first.	Ṣugbọn o lọ akọkọ.
I want fast.	Mo fe sare.
They talk and laugh with each other.	Wọn sọrọ ati rẹrin pẹlu ara wọn.
I would not like that trip to anyone.	Emi kii yoo fẹ irin-ajo yẹn si ẹnikẹni.
Much of it.	Pupọ ninu rẹ.
But move and learn.	Ṣugbọn gbe ati kọ ẹkọ.
He was a very good man.	O jẹ eniyan ti o dara pupọ.
You have to say something.	O ni lati sọ nkankan.
I have already divorced my brother.	Mo ti kọ arakunrin mi tẹlẹ.
He could not get on the train back home.	Ko le gba lori ọkọ oju irin pada si ile.
You can do it all at the same time.	O le ṣe gbogbo rẹ ni akoko kanna.
You know what it feels like when you are in love.	O mọ bi o ṣe ri nigbati o ba wa ni ifẹ.
Here is a picture taken at the meeting.	Eyi ni aworan ti o ya ni ipade.
Tell us this and you can go home.	Sọ fun wa eyi ati pe o le lọ si ile.
The world is beautiful!	Aye jẹ lẹwa!
I didn’t notice the moment.	Emi ko ṣe akiyesi akoko naa.
He has an appointment at two o'clock.	O ni ipinnu lati pade ni aago meji.
Leave me any information you have.	Fi alaye eyikeyi ti o ni silẹ fun mi.
I just want the truth to be told.	Mo kan fẹ ki a sọ ohun buburu naa ni otitọ.
He did it himself, as a child.	O ṣe funrararẹ, bi ọmọde.
I can't do anything about it.	Nko le se nkankan nipa re.
The sister is not like the others.	Arabinrin naa ko dabi awọn miiran.
And it’s not an accident.	Ati pe kii ṣe ijamba.
When he returned from lunch, he met a friend.	Nigbati o pada lati ounjẹ ọsan, o pade ọrẹ kan.
How my life has changed.	Bawo ni igbesi aye mi ti yipada.
Or maybe you can.	Tabi boya o le.
You really don’t want to miss out.	O gan ko fẹ lati padanu jade.
I can see it now.	Mo ti le ri i bayi.
I don’t have to go through it.	Emi ko ni lati lọ nipasẹ rẹ.
They need someone special for this position.	Wọn nilo ẹnikan pataki fun ipo yii.
His wife refused to include.	Iyawo rẹ kọ lati ni ninu.
Unknown faces have to be outside.	Awọn oju ti a ko mọ ni ki wa ni ita.
In his position, he seems to have.	Ni ipo rẹ, o dabi pe o ni.
It is not something they have already done.	Kii ṣe nkan ti wọn ti ṣe tẹlẹ.
Make yours.	Ṣe tirẹ.
We didn't see it until a while later '.	A ko wo o titi di igba diẹ lẹhin '.
I was not able to travel.	Emi ko ni anfani lati rin irin-ajo.
You get an understanding in dealing with people and situations.	O gba oye kan ni ṣiṣe pẹlu eniyan ati awọn ipo.
Your car must be hot.	Ọkọ rẹ gbọdọ gbona.
But do not forget the name.	Ṣugbọn maṣe gbagbe orukọ naa.
The trees live near the river.	Awọn igi n gbe nitosi odo.
The game is beautiful.	Awọn ere jẹ lẹwa.
And he notices that he looks good.	O si ṣe akiyesi pe o dabi ẹni pe o dara.
She lives in a small apartment	O ngbe ni ile kekere kekere kan
I will read all this soon.	Emi yoo ka gbogbo nkan yii laipẹ.
And the other laughed.	Ati awọn miiran rẹrin.
They are as local as possible.	Wọn ti wa ni agbegbe bi o ti ṣee ṣe.
Cut the bottom and top of the eggplant.	Ge awọn isalẹ ati awọn oke ti Igba.
My father will not accept.	Baba mi ko ni gba.
I can't find it in the house, either.	Emi ko le ri i ninu ile, boya.
For something as simple as this.	Fun nkan bi o rọrun bi eyi.
This should be obvious.	Eyi yẹ ki o han gbangba.
There is no value in life.	Ko si iye ni aye.
You must tell me what your thoughts are.	O gbọdọ sọ fun mi kini awọn ero rẹ jẹ.
There are many.	Ọpọlọpọ wa ni o wa.
You do not.	O ko ṣe.
He was a very old man.	O jẹ ẹnikan ti o dagba pupọ.
I can’t believe it, but it’s worth it.	Emi ko le gbagbọ, ṣugbọn o tọ.
I finished.	Mo ti pari.
They have two children.	Wọn ni ọmọ meji.
But you seem to know that.	Ṣugbọn o dabi ẹni pe o mọ iyẹn.
He asked me where they went.	O beere lọwọ mi nibo ni wọn lọ.
We do not want the same situation to happen to us.	A ko fẹ ki ipo kanna ṣẹlẹ si wa.
O ge e kuro.	O ge e kuro.
You can not do anything.	O ko le ṣe ohunkohun.
It tastes great.	O dun pupo.
It reads like a book.	O ka bi iwe kan.
That doesn’t mean anything.	Eyi ko tumọ si nkankan.
I live two streets.	Mo gbe ita meji.
These skills will help you build a career.	Awọn ọgbọn wọnyi yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ lati kọ iṣẹ kan.
I never met one.	Emi ko pade ọkan.
You have to plan your year.	O ni lati gbero ọdun rẹ.
I'll just give them one.	Emi yoo kan fun wọn ni ọkan.
They can not rise from here.	Wọn ko le ga soke lati ibi.
No one knows whether the stories are true or not.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ boya awọn itan jẹ otitọ tabi rara.
It can't be.	Ko le wa.
I can say that.	Mo le sọ iyẹn.
Have to walk.	Ni lati rin.
Will never miss anything to go.	Yoo ko padanu mi nkankan lati lọ.
I think you have to start there.	Mo ro pe o ni lati bẹrẹ nibẹ.
They should be here.	Wọn yẹ ki o wa nibi.
With your own hands.	Pẹlu ọwọ ara rẹ.
And he did not.	Ati pe ko ṣe.
It may have seemed like a new idea, but not really.	O le ti dabi imọran tuntun, ṣugbọn kii ṣe gaan.
Easy to ask for.	Rọrun lati beere fun.
I told him not to move.	Mo ti so fun u ko lati gbe.
His mother has been a teacher.	Iya rẹ ti jẹ olukọ.
They do something really good.	Wọn ṣe nkan ti o dara julọ.
In the end it is not that bad.	Ni ipari kii ṣe pe buburu.
He opened his eyes.	O ṣii oju rẹ.
He looked around, but could not see anyone.	O wo ni ayika, ṣugbọn ko le ri ẹnikan.
Know yourself well, especially.	Mọ ara rẹ daradara, paapaa.
Bring that back to my house before you go.	Mu iyẹn pada si ile mi ṣaaju ki o to lọ.
So enjoy the love, and enjoy the songs.	Nitorina gbadun ife naa, ki o si gbadun awọn orin naa.
I will find someone else there.	Emi yoo wa ẹniti o wa nibẹ miiran.
What it means is obvious.	Ohun ti o tumọ si han gbangba.
Tell you this.	Sọ fun ọ eyi.
Nothing could be wrong now.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe aṣiṣe ni bayi.
Good for him.	O dara fun u.
Many police officers are searching the area.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọlọpa ti n wa agbegbe naa.
Okay, there is something.	O dara, nkan kan wa.
A world they have lived in.	Aye kan ti wọn ti gbe ni.
You need to remember your site.	O nilo lati ranti aaye rẹ.
It has been a matter of weeks.	O ti jẹ ọrọ kan ti awọn ọsẹ.
It’s not that you need to.	Kii ṣe pe o nilo lati.
We have to continue working.	A ni lati tẹsiwaju ṣiṣẹ.
You now understand how it is.	O loye bayi bi o ṣe jẹ.
If it works, it’s good for both parties.	Ti o ba ṣiṣẹ, o dara fun awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji.
I know it's time for us to talk.	Mo mọ pe o to akoko fun wa lati sọrọ.
I hit me.	Mo lu mi.
We do not need this.	A ko nilo eyi.
The best celebrations start with a great meal.	Awọn ayẹyẹ ti o dara julọ bẹrẹ pẹlu ounjẹ nla.
I don’t know how that could happen.	Emi ko mọ bi iyẹn ṣe le ṣẹlẹ.
Search for us in a week.	Wa fun wa ni ọsẹ kan.
We were outside on the road into the night.	A wa ni ita ni opopona sinu alẹ.
And a job is a job.	Ati pe iṣẹ kan jẹ iṣẹ kan.
I have seen it for many years.	Mo ti ri i fun ọdun pupọ.
Can you live that?	Ṣe o le gbe iyẹn?
Same as it was.	Kanna bi o ti wà.
Worth the money !.	Tọ owo naa!.
It looks like you.	O dabi iwọ pupọ.
I don’t get why everyone has to drive.	Emi ko gba idi ti gbogbo eniyan ni lati wakọ.
So he laughed.	Nitorina o rẹrin.
I want to write a book.	Mo fẹ kọ iwe kan.
The one who fears him.	Ẹniti o bẹru rẹ.
Nothing can stand in the way of our parents' love.	Ko si ohun ti o le duro ni ọna ifẹ awọn obi wa.
Wait for another few weeks and try again.	Duro fun ọsẹ diẹ miiran ki o tun gbiyanju lẹẹkansi.
Her brother has admitted.	Arakunrin rẹ ti gba eleyi.
One meal, please.	Jọwọ, ounjẹ kan.
You look at your phone.	O wo foonu rẹ.
I do not ask here.	Emi ko beere nibi.
It makes the game fun.	O jẹ ki ere naa dun.
Not that you expect any.	Kii ṣe pe o nireti eyikeyi.
Standing in front of me was at least 30 people.	Ti o duro ni iwaju mi ​​ni o kere ju ọgbọn eniyan.
For a while at least, it was fun.	Fun igba diẹ o kere ju, o dun.
He is here today to hurt people.	O wa nibi loni lati ṣe eniyan ipalara.
You can't understand, right now.	O ko le ni oye, ni bayi.
Maybe you talked to your friends at that time.	Boya o ba awọn ọrẹ rẹ sọrọ ni akoko yẹn.
I am not one of them.	Emi kii ṣe ọkan ninu wọn.
I hope it won’t, however.	Mo nireti pe kii yoo, sibẹsibẹ.
The report does not say how long it took.	Iroyin naa ko sọ igba ti o gba.
At least some of them.	O kere julọ ninu wọn.
You see it now.	O tun rii ni bayi.
Such a great book.	Iru iwe nla kan.
Write most of the books.	Kọ julọ ti awọn iwe.
We do the same for other groups.	A ṣe kanna fun awọn ẹgbẹ miiran.
Maybe more than that.	Boya diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
She tells him they are nearby.	O sọ fun u pe wọn wa nitosi.
You want them to be in front.	O fẹ ki wọn wa ni iwaju.
Their lives are not good.	Aye won ko dara.
You and your mother.	Iwọ ati iya rẹ.
I don’t even see it.	Emi ko paapaa wo o.
We are happy to do so for these beautiful dogs.	Inu wa dun lati ṣe bẹ fun awọn aja to dara wọnyi.
Everyone else seems to be doing a lot of the same.	Gbogbo eniyan miiran dabi pe o n ṣe pupọ kanna.
He is looking for a wife.	O n wa iyawo.
I can't remember anything.	Nko le ranti nkankan.
That's what hair does.	Ohun ti irun ṣe niyẹn.
They are the first to arrive.	Wọn jẹ akọkọ lati de.
After two weeks, he returned.	Lẹhin ọsẹ meji, o pada.
He did a wonderful job.	O ṣe iṣẹ iyanu kan.
Such love in them.	Iru ife ninu won.
You definitely don’t know me.	O daju ko mọ mi.
If you find, you use that value.	Ti o ba rii, o lo iye yẹn.
I want to move.	Mo fe gbe.
He will not receive it.	Ko ni gba a.
Let's not play games.	Jẹ ká ko mu awọn ere.
But listen, that’s nothing.	Ṣugbọn gbọ, iyẹn kii ṣe nkankan.
We must wash our hands before eating.	A gbọdọ wẹ ọwọ wa ṣaaju ounjẹ.
We really enjoyed our meal.	A gbadun ounjẹ wa pupọ.
These tests are important.	Awọn idanwo wọnyi jẹ pataki.
Now you say the names.	Bayi o sọ awọn orukọ.
This is where the accident happened.	Eyi ni ibi ti ijamba naa ti ṣẹlẹ.
I can’t stay tonight for so many personal reasons.	Emi ko le duro ni alẹ oni fun awọn idi ti ara ẹni pupọ.
In the same way his mother did.	Ni ọna kanna ti iya rẹ ṣe.
We would love to hear your thoughts !.	A yoo fẹ lati gbọ rẹ ero!.
It was inside and nothing was broken.	O wa ninu ati pe ko si ohun ti o fọ.
It has done for me.	O ti ṣe fun mi.
What can we say about this song?	Kini a le sọ nipa orin yii?
We are all.	Gbogbo wa.
They will not expect that.	Wọn kii yoo nireti pe.
I'm glad the songs are understandable.	Inu mi dun pe awọn orin naa jẹ oye.
It includes two most important things.	O pẹlu meji julọ pataki ohun.
To be sure.	Lati rii daju.
But we can not.	Sugbon a le ko.
That means you both will have to take up space.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe iwọ mejeeji yoo ni lati gba aaye.
And it looks great.	Ati ki o wo nla.
I want you to go out and get one.	Mo fẹ ki o jade lọ gba ọkan.
I can accept or leave.	Mo le gba tabi fi silẹ.
I can tell you well.	Mo le so fun o daradara.
He measured them.	O si wọn.
I decided to go home.	Mo pinnu lati lọ sinu ile.
He has had families too, many families.	O ti ni idile pẹlu, ọpọlọpọ awọn idile.
Maybe pull them into your garden.	Boya fa wọn sinu ọgba rẹ.
They sit around a table.	Wọn joko ni ayika tabili kan.
Okay, maybe not, but you can have it.	O dara, boya kii ṣe, ṣugbọn ti o ba le ni yoo ni.
Plans for the building have been scrapped.	Awọn eto fun ile naa ti kọ silẹ.
Of course we are not talking about this at all.	Dajudaju a ko sọrọ nipa eyi rara.
You must go out.	O gbọdọ jade.
No one ever picked them up.	Ko si ọkan lailai gbe wọn soke.
I could not do without him.	Emi ko le ṣe laisi rẹ.
The reasons for this can be many.	Awọn idi fun eyi le jẹ pupọ.
Maybe they didn’t.	Boya wọn ko ṣe bẹ.
We do not believe them.	A ko gbagbọ wọn.
About a month.	Nipa oṣu kan.
We are learning something.	A n kọ nkan kan.
My parents will do anything to give us the best education possible.	Awọn obi mi yoo ṣe ohunkohun lati fun wa ni ẹkọ ti o dara julọ ti o ṣeeṣe.
The book also makes this clear.	Iwe naa tun jẹ ki eyi han gbangba.
He couldn’t believe he would hit.	Ko le gbagbọ pe oun yoo lu.
It was wonderful to meet old friends again.	O jẹ ohun iyanu lati tun pade awọn ọrẹ atijọ.
He also admitted.	O tun gba eleyi.
How things matter is very important to us.	Bawo ni awọn nkan ṣe ṣe pataki pupọ si wa.
He decided to go for the test.	O pinnu lati lọ fun idanwo naa.
More power is always a good thing.	Agbara diẹ sii nigbagbogbo jẹ ohun ti o dara.
You can only think about the future.	O le ronu nipa ọjọ iwaju nikan.
But there is more to come.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii wa lati wa.
I think you need to get some help.	Mo ro pe o nilo lati gba iranlọwọ diẹ.
There is so much to do.	Ọpọlọpọ ti wa lati ṣe.
The importance of sound environment.	Pataki ti agbegbe ohun.
We went where we needed to go.	A lọ si ibi ti a nilo.
This house is historically important.	Ile yii ni pataki itan.
Up and out of the boat, and back again.	Si oke ati jade kuro ninu ọkọ oju omi, ati pada lẹẹkansi.
This is what you expect.	Eyi ni ohun ti o nireti.
Living in trees is not an easy life.	Ngbe ninu awọn igi kii ṣe igbesi aye ti o rọrun.
It could be the other way around.	O le jẹ ọna miiran ni ayika.
Their rivers.	Awon odo ti won.
It is only a short time.	O jẹ igba diẹ nikan.
He has three brothers.	O ni awọn arakunrin mẹta.
He didn’t do any of that here, however.	Oun ko ṣe eyikeyi iyẹn nibi, sibẹsibẹ.
I stopped singing.	Mo da orin duro.
Life is a game for those who are.	Igbesi aye jẹ ere fun awọn ti o wa.
Could you.	Se o le.
He would hope to be at home.	Oun yoo nireti lati wa ni ile.
It was ‘me’ doing.	O jẹ 'mi' ṣe.
All you need is sound and text.	Gbogbo ohun ti o nilo ni ohun ati ọrọ.
Continue reading.	Tẹsiwaju ki o ka.
He was a good family man.	O jẹ ọkunrin idile ti o dara.
One can change.	Eniyan le yipada.
There are some, perhaps, who do.	Awọn kan wa, boya, ti o ṣe.
He wanted to stand out.	O fe lati duro jade.
It was a great deal.	O jẹ adehun nla kan.
I don’t hate it or love it.	Emi ko korira rẹ tabi nifẹ rẹ.
He pulled a seat into the space.	O fa ijoko kan si aaye.
Come, now, do not be angry with me.	Wa, ni bayi, maṣe binu si mi.
Open the field.	Ṣii aaye naa.
Here is that class to help with that question.	Eyi ni kilasi yẹn lati ṣe iranlọwọ pẹlu ibeere naa.
He remarried and had a son.	O tun iyawo, o si tun bi ọmọkunrin kan.
She has a child with her.	O ni ọmọ kan pẹlu rẹ.
He is not the bride.	Oun kii ṣe iyawo naa.
She sat up and wondered how she could be so wrong.	O joko o si ṣe iyalẹnu bawo ni o ṣe le ṣe aṣiṣe pupọ.
Just got it.	O kan ni o.
They are all there.	Gbogbo wa nibẹ.
It never came out.	Ko ṣe jade rara.
He also has hair.	O tun ni irun.
So we stopped.	Nitorina a duro.
But you need to know more.	Ṣugbọn o nilo lati mọ diẹ sii.
They are late to the celebration.	Wọn ti pẹ si ayẹyẹ naa.
Please finish your dinner.	Jọwọ pari ounjẹ alẹ rẹ.
But we can do better than this.	Ṣugbọn a le ṣe dara julọ ju nkan yii lọ.
Children always expect to fly.	Awọn ọmọde nigbagbogbo nireti lati fo.
You see, wait.	O wo, duro.
They are not invited.	Wọn ko pe.
Removed.	Ti yọ kuro.
The important thing is that they always have.	Pataki ni wipe ti won nigbagbogbo ni.
He wanted to call, but something stopped him.	O fẹ lati pe, ṣugbọn nkan kan da a duro.
Tomorrow will be their last day.	Ọla ni yoo jẹ ọjọ ikẹhin wọn.
I really do not.	Emi gan ko.
You want to go yours.	O fẹ lọ tirẹ.
In my house.	Ni ile mi.
Children need rest to grow.	Awọn ọmọde nilo isinmi lati dagba.
The road is full.	Opopona naa ti kun.
Okay, maybe you do.	O dara, boya o ṣe.
The train was full of people.	Ọkọ oju irin naa ti kun fun awọn eniyan.
He told me a little.	O sọ fun mi diẹ.
Take an interest in them.	Ya ohun anfani ni wọn.
We know what happened, we know who made your device.	A mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ, a mọ ẹniti o ṣe ẹrọ rẹ.
I think he is too.	Mo ro pe oun naa ni.
You can never get a job again.	O ko le gba iṣẹ lẹẹkansi.
It changed all the way.	O yipada si gbogbo awọn ọna.
He could not go to summer school.	Ko le lọ si ile-iwe igba ooru.
You see some ideas.	O ri diẹ ninu awọn ero.
If not, you may not be able to find much.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, o le ma ni anfani lati wa pupọ.
Of course there may be others.	Dajudaju awọn miiran le wa.

He was asking me a question.	O n beere ibeere kan fun mi.
I have to finish this soon.	Mo ni lati pari eyi laipẹ.
Turn your back on them.	Yipada rẹ pada lori wọn.
Others are not convinced.	Awọn miiran ko da wọn loju.
Take the first question.	Ya idi ibeere akọkọ.
Let’s make things easier this year.	Jẹ ki a jẹ ki awọn nkan rọrun ni ọdun yii.
People only do what they know they can get away with.	Awọn eniyan nikan ṣe ohun ti wọn mọ pe wọn le lọ kuro.
It is very easy to go and move back.	O rọrun pupọ lati lọ ati ki o gbe pada.
I hope someone tells me.	Mo nireti pe ẹnikan sọ fun mi.
Most of the time we have to wait for them.	Ọpọlọpọ igba ti a ni lati duro fun wọn.
And, right now, what you love is starting to happen.	Ati, ni bayi, ohun ti o nifẹ bẹrẹ lati ṣẹlẹ.
Now you know why.	Bayi o mọ idi.
I want to stand there and beat you.	Mo fe lati duro nibẹ ki o si lu ọ.
It makes us notice.	O jẹ ki a ṣe akiyesi.
It can be hard at times.	O le jẹ lile ni awọn igba.
They are the value of the space.	Wọn jẹ iye ti aaye naa.
Her water was cut in two.	Omi rẹ ti ge si meji.
She was kind enough to want to help me.	O jẹ iru rẹ lati fẹ ran mi lọwọ.
At least you can use some of it.	O kere o le lo diẹ ninu rẹ.
Do not leave anything around.	Maṣe fi ohunkohun silẹ ni ayika.
Just visit when you need to.	Kan ṣabẹwo si nigbati o nilo lati.
I'm not sure how long this will last.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bi eyi yoo ṣe pẹ to.
Maybe love is not the issue.	Boya ifẹ kii ṣe ọrọ naa.
They may have been there.	Wọn le ti wa nibẹ.
He was not very happy about the situation.	Inu rẹ ko dun pupọ nipa ipo naa.
In a way.	Ni ọna kan.
It's rainy.	Akoko ojo ni.
Especially for the boy.	Ni pataki fun ọmọkunrin naa.
We must go soon.	A gbọdọ lọ laipẹ.
Parking in urban areas is not possible.	Pa ni awọn agbegbe ilu ko ṣee ṣe.
If you are interested, you can find it.	Ti o ba nifẹ, o le rii.
This is a surprising fact.	Eyi jẹ otitọ iyalẹnu kan.
That takes years to live, learn.	Iyẹn gba awọn ọdun lati gbe, kọ ẹkọ.
He goes, he talks again.	O n lọ, o tun sọrọ.
Just move for 30 minutes a day.	O kan gbe fun ọgbọn iṣẹju ni ọjọ kan.
Just come back and see what you can do.	O kan pada wa ati rii ohun ti o le ṣe.
Go work for him.	Lọ ṣiṣẹ fun u.
I'm not really sure.	Emi ko da mi loju gaan.
He is here now.	O wa nibi bayi.
Bad news awaits me next week.	Awọn iroyin buburu n duro de mi ni ọsẹ to nbọ.
It sounds.	O dun.
Which is probably my first mistake.	Eyi ti o ṣee ṣe aṣiṣe akọkọ mi.
Now it seems they are really surprised.	Bayi o dabi pe wọn ti ya gaan.
Which means he doesn’t sleep.	Eyi ti o tumọ si pe ko sun.
We met one in town.	A pade ọkan ni ilu.
The news is bad.	Awọn iroyin buburu ni.
From day one.	Lati ọjọ kan.
I’ve been thinking about it too.	Mo ti n ronu nipa rẹ paapaa.
I watched it.	Mo ti wo e.
I will stay with you.	Emi yoo duro pẹlu rẹ.
They are the best around.	Wọn jẹ ti o dara julọ ni ayika.
She was sitting at an inappropriate small table.	O joko ni tabili kekere ti ko yẹ.
They will finish what they started.	Wọn yoo pari ohun ti wọn bẹrẹ.
We can make our own decisions.	A le pinnu ipinnu wa fun ara wa.
Their stories are incredibly similar.	Awọn itan wọn jẹ iyalẹnu iru.
His hand pulled her over him.	Ọwọ rẹ fa rẹ lori rẹ.
And we don’t need stress.	Ati pe a ko nilo wahala.
I do not have a car.	Emi ko ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
That was long enough for him to remarry.	Iyẹn gun to fun u lati tun ṣe igbeyawo.
I want you to ask me questions.	Mo fẹ ki o beere lọwọ mi awọn ibeere.
At school, it was just lunch.	Ni ile-iwe, o jẹ ounjẹ ọsan nikan.
Okay, that’s what you say here.	O dara, iyẹn ni ohun ti o sọ nibi.
No one is here.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa nibi.
It was because his brother asked for it.	O wa nitori arakunrin rẹ beere fun u.
There are many bodies around you.	Awọn ara pupọ lo wa ni ayika rẹ.
All that can be forever.	Gbogbo ohun ti o le jẹ lailai.
This may take some time, weeks or more.	Eyi le gba akoko diẹ, ọsẹ tabi diẹ sii.
Let a work done by me.	Jẹ ki iṣẹ kan ti a ṣe nipasẹ mi.
Class dropped out early.	Kilasi ti yọ kuro ni kutukutu.
I believe it was the truth you told me.	Mo gbagbọ pe o jẹ otitọ ti o sọ fun mi.
I just stopped here.	Mo kan duro nibi.
I have enough to continue.	Mo ni to lati tẹsiwaju.
So it seems to work for me.	Nitorina o dabi pe o ṣiṣẹ fun mi.
Buy it now !.	Ra ni bayi!.
I will be near you.	Emi yoo wa nitosi rẹ.
That is the law.	Ofin niyen.
I’m starting to wonder.	Mo n bẹrẹ lati ṣe iyalẹnu.
Why, we can do anything.	Kilode, a le ṣe ohunkohun.
Work may stop.	Iṣẹ le duro.
He will hate this picture.	Oun yoo korira aworan yii.
Tell him it happened.	Sọ fun u pe o ti ṣẹlẹ.
I am going this way.	Mo n lọ ni ọna yii.
None of them.	Ko si ninu ọkan ninu wọn.
We must have help.	A gbọdọ ni iranlọwọ.
Very good.	Pupọ ti o dara.
I tried it, it works well.	Mo ti gbiyanju o, o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
The man stopped.	Ọkunrin naa duro.
No, it is not a tree.	Rara, kii ṣe igi kan.
He has not left.	O ko ti lọ kuro.
They became best friends.	Wọn di ọrẹ to dara julọ.
Before you go.	Ṣaaju ki o to lọ.
That's too long.	Iyẹn gun ju.
High, but it has been a long time.	Ga, sugbon o ti igba pipẹ.
Nothing of this was known to me until a few weeks ago.	Ko si nkan ti eyi ti a mọ si mi titi di ọsẹ diẹ sẹhin.
You never know what the injury might be.	O ko mọ ohun ti ipalara le ṣe.
I want them in place so my group is not recognized.	Mo fẹ wọn ni ibi ki a ko da ẹgbẹ mi mọ.
Who would have thought we would see one of them.	Tani yoo ti ro pe a yoo rii ọkan ninu wọn.
I remember going for a while.	Mo ranti lilọ ni igba diẹ.
So sleep on, my son,	Nitorina sun lori, ọmọ mi,
It did a good job.	O ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara.
He lifted me up.	O gbe mi dide.
It is possible that his father will kill him after this.	O ṣee ṣe pe baba rẹ yoo pa a lẹhin eyi.
The nearby trees are great for walking.	Awọn igi ti o wa nitosi jẹ nla fun rin.
But he is not alone.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe oun nikan.
Anything will help.	Ohunkohun yoo ran.
I don’t understand that even a bit.	Emi ko loye iyẹn paapaa diẹ.
He looked inside.	O wo inu aaye.
Some people not so much.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ko ki Elo.
At least he has written something.	O kere o ti kọ nkankan.
No field names need to be changed.	Ko si awọn orukọ aaye nilo lati yipada.
It is inside.	O jẹ inu inu.
I’ve done something like this before, it works well.	Mo ti ṣe iru nkan tẹlẹ, o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
They want to know how to get out of the mess.	Wọn fẹ lati mọ bi wọn ṣe le jade kuro ni lilọ.
The doors to the outside are open.	Awọn ilẹkun si ita ti ṣi silẹ.
I do not think so.	Emi ko ro bẹ.
They don’t need us remaining to get.	Wọn ko nilo wa ti o ku lati gba.
The room now looks like yours.	Yara bayi dabi tirẹ.
Decide whether to write or not.	Pinnu boya lati kọ tabi ko.
But you can understand.	Sugbon o le ni oye.
You know what that looks like.	O mọ bi iyẹn ṣe ri.
He died in his sleep.	O ku ninu oorun rẹ.
Try walking around a bit.	Gbiyanju lati rin ni ayika diẹ.
I forgot they could use someone like you.	Mo gbagbe pe wọn le lo ẹnikan bi rẹ.
I am not here for new friends.	Emi ko wa nibi fun awọn ọrẹ tuntun.
He called for help but no one answered.	O pe fun iranlọwọ ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o gbọ.
They usually go out at night only.	Wọn maa n jade ni alẹ nikan.
Go to the top of the class.	Lọ si oke ti kilasi naa.
It seems to make them really happy.	O dabi ẹni pe o mu inu wọn dun gaan.
It’s something else.	O jẹ nkan miiran.
We just fear it.	A kan bẹru rẹ.
Change your life.	Yi aye re pada.
A man was bathing.	Ọkunrin kan n wẹ.
So do not change the setting.	Nitorina maṣe yi eto pada.
At one point he saw someone like him.	Ni akoko kan o ri ẹnikan ti o dabi rẹ.
I will not be here in the morning.	Emi kii yoo wa nibi ni owurọ.
Ever since you knew how true love really feels.	Lati igba ti o ti mọ bi ifẹ otitọ ṣe rilara gaan.
I thought nothing of the moment.	Mo ro ohunkohun ti o ni akoko.
Teachers want all students to learn.	Awọn olukọ fẹ ki gbogbo awọn ọmọ ile-iwe kọ ẹkọ.
They have begun.	Wọn ti bẹrẹ.
Just let me think.	O kan jẹ ki n ronu.
He did not know the nature of his father.	O ko mọ iru baba rẹ.
I do not want to give him any information.	Emi ko fẹ lati fun u eyikeyi alaye.
You get groups.	O gba awọn ẹgbẹ.
Now you are asking for more work from me.	Bayi o wa beere fun iṣẹ diẹ sii lọwọ mi.
Learn to laugh.	Kọ ẹkọ lati rẹrin.
I'll see you tomorrow.	Emi yoo ri i ni ọla.
All we can know is that the story must continue.	Gbogbo ohun ti a le mọ ni pe itan naa gbọdọ tẹsiwaju.
How does this make you feel ?.	Bawo ni eyi ṣe jẹ ki o lero?.
I can show it to him.	Mo le fi han fun u.
Okay, that’s one thing.	O dara, nkan kan niyẹn.
We don’t have time for that right now.	A ko ni akoko fun iyẹn ni bayi.
For a long time we all just stood there.	Fun igba pipẹ gbogbo wa kan duro nibẹ.
And they know about me.	Ati pe wọn mọ nipa mi.
They have been amazing.	Wọn ti jẹ iyanu.
Tell him what you need to do.	Sọ ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe fun u.
I only heard what you heard.	Mo ti gbọ nikan ohun ti o gbọ.
Well, it's important, of course.	O dara, o ṣe pataki, dajudaju.
He is always there for us.	O wa nigbagbogbo fun wa.
Turn it off.	Pa a lọ.
But nothing of that kind happened on that day.	Ṣugbọn ohunkohun ti iru ṣẹlẹ lori wipe ọjọ.
The children are still in school.	Awọn ọmọ si tun wa ni ile-iwe.
Just make sure you do not do it at the same time.	O kan rii daju pe ki o ma ṣe ni akoko kanna.
And how you want to live there.	Ati bi o ṣe fẹ lati gbe nibẹ.
Many people miss the old days.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan padanu awọn ọjọ atijọ.
He will give you whatever you have.	Oun yoo fun ọ ni ohunkohun ti o ni.
We just get up and move on.	A kan dide ki a tẹsiwaju.
This works well.	Eleyi ṣiṣẹ daradara.
It must be a matter of money.	O gbọdọ jẹ ọrọ ti owo naa.
I mean, some pictures have never been seen before.	Mo tumọ si, diẹ ninu awọn aworan ko tii ri tẹlẹ.
To bathe a lot.	Lati wẹ pupọ.
We will be in this house for at least a year.	A yoo wa ni ile yii o kere ju ọdun kan.
That causes people to drop out.	Ti o fa eniyan lati ju silẹ jade.
She is worried about her husband no.	O ni aniyan nipa ọkọ rẹ ko si.
We have to pick them first.	A ni lati mu wọn akọkọ.
I want to put my life together and move on.	Mo fẹ lati fi aye mi papọ ki o tẹsiwaju.
Maybe that might work.	Boya iyẹn le ṣiṣẹ.
Bind this into one.	Di eyi si ọkan.
It was an easy decision to make.	O jẹ ipinnu rọrun lati ṣe.
No, it just is.	Rara, o kan jẹ.
I'm not happy at all.	Inu mi ko dun rara.
These words are simple and they can.	Awọn ọrọ wọnyi rọrun ati pe wọn le.
Some do not know that it is happening today.	Diẹ ninu awọn ko mọ pe loni n ṣẹlẹ.
We did a really good job of getting it taken away.	A ṣe kan gan ti o dara ise ti a gba o ya kuro.
I know that's not easy.	Mo mọ pe iyẹn ko rọrun.
She quickly looked at the store.	O yara wo ile itaja.
It is always there after the ceremony.	Nigbagbogbo o tun wa lẹhin ayẹyẹ.
Maybe better if you can sleep.	Boya dara ti o ba le sun oorun.
We need to fly.	A nilo fo.
Let them raise their money.	Jẹ ki wọn gbe owo wọn soke.
I mean to tell you.	Mo tumọ lati sọ fun ọ.
Go than see it.	Lọ ju wo o.
We cannot measure our path to a better education system.	A ko le wọn ọna wa si eto eto ẹkọ to dara julọ.
I need to see this brother.	Mo nilo lati wo arakunrin yii.
Lots of good music back in the area.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn orin ti o dara pada ni agbegbe naa.
My children are fine.	Awọn ọmọ mi dara.
how beautiful it is.	bawo ni o ṣe lẹwa.
Sometimes time stands still.	Nigba miiran akoko duro jẹ.
But this is not the area we are looking for here.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe agbegbe ti a n wa nibi.
At least that's what we said.	O kere ju iyẹn ni ohun ti a sọ.
It had to be, he thought, something about the house.	O ni lati wa, o ro pe, nkankan nipa ile.
I'm not happy about it.	Emi ko dun nipa rẹ.
But I do not see.	Sugbon emi ko ri.
We found everything good.	A ri ohun gbogbo ti o dara.
I cut it off.	Mo ge e kuro.
I am good at such things.	Mo dara ni iru awọn nkan bẹẹ.
You want to buy them away.	O fẹ lati ra wọn kuro.
These areas serve as complementary areas.	Awọn agbegbe wọnyi ṣiṣẹ bi awọn agbegbe ti o pe.
Nothing beyond that.	Ko si ohun ti o kọja iyẹn.
With what he is telling me.	Pẹlu ohun ti o n sọ fun mi.
The problem started.	Iṣoro naa bẹrẹ si i.
I am taking it home.	Mo n gbe e lọ si ile.
But there is so much more.	Ṣugbọn pupọ pupọ ni ọpọlọpọ.
They could not find a place to go.	Wọn ko le wa ibi ti o lọ.
However he did not notice one of it.	Sibẹsibẹ ko ṣe akiyesi ọkan ninu rẹ.
We can rent a book for two weeks.	A le ya iwe kan fun ọsẹ meji.
My words are true.	Awọn ọrọ mi jẹ otitọ.
Can't just put it.	Ko le kan fi le.
He will not miss.	Oun yoo ko padanu.
I looked at my mother and father.	Mo wo iya mi ati baba mi.
He asked me one day.	O beere lọwọ mi ni ọjọ kan.
It makes you wonder what is wrong with you.	O jẹ ki o ṣe iyalẹnu kini aṣiṣe pẹlu rẹ.
It is a good thing for everyone.	O jẹ ohun ti o dara julọ fun gbogbo eniyan.
I bought some books at a store.	Mo ra awọn iwe diẹ ni ile itaja kan.
I can not sleep and it is doing well.	Emi ko le sun ati pe o n ṣe daradara.
It is a very important thing.	O jẹ nkan ti o ṣe pataki pupọ.
What the world is about.	Ohun ti aye jẹ nipa.
Very good you must visit.	O dara pupọ o gbọdọ ṣabẹwo.
I am very confident.	Mo ni idaniloju pupọ.
His mother knew.	Iya rẹ mọ.
You feel better.	O ro dara julọ.
So did everyone else.	Bẹẹ ni gbogbo eniyan miiran ṣe.
Where do u live?	Nibo ni o ngbe?
Tell them about the decision and what they know about it.	Sọ fun wọn nipa ipinnu ati ohun ti wọn mọ nipa rẹ.
He looked at the dog.	O wo aja.
He taught her that she knew he was coming.	O kọ ọ pe o mọ pe o nbọ.
He asked a lot of questions.	O beere ọpọlọpọ awọn ibeere.
And he continues to do so today.	Ati pe o tẹsiwaju lati ṣe bẹ loni.
All is well for us.	Gbogbo dara fun wa.
It feels good and your home looks really good.	O lero dara ati pe ile rẹ dara dara daradara.
I think about here.	Mo ro nipa nibi.
It is also in your life.	O tun wa ninu igbesi aye rẹ.
When he heard the news, his words changed.	Nigbati o gbọ awọn iroyin, ọrọ rẹ yipada.
I hope this changes soon.	Mo nireti pe eyi yipada laipẹ.
You should keep living, not winning!	O yẹ ki o tọju igbesi aye, ko gba!
It has been a journey.	O ti jẹ irin-ajo kan.
And that's fine.	Ati pe iyẹn dara.
There is no such thing here.	Nibi ko si iru nkan bayi.
See you at one of those two places !.	Wo ọ ni ọkan ninu awọn aaye meji yẹn!.
No one will tell me why.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo sọ idi rẹ fun mi.
First, the bad news.	Ni akọkọ, awọn iroyin buburu.
I do not understand.	Emi ko loye.
History up to that time.	Itan titi di akoko yẹn.
I tried it at work and it wasn’t there, so.	Mo gbiyanju rẹ ni ibi iṣẹ ati pe ko si nibẹ, bẹ.
And it was a big mistake.	Ati pe o jẹ aṣiṣe nla kan.
Again, ask me.	Lẹẹkansi, beere lọwọ mi.
This will not always be true of other games, however.	Eyi kii yoo jẹ otitọ nigbagbogbo ti awọn ere miiran, sibẹsibẹ.
And so is everyone else.	Ati bẹ ni gbogbo eniyan miiran.
Maybe this situation is that for both.	Boya ipo yii jẹ iyẹn fun awọn mejeeji.
It doesn’t benefit you, of course, but.	Ko ṣe anfani si ọ, dajudaju, ṣugbọn.
That is if you still have a plan.	Iyẹn jẹ ti o ba tun ni eto kan.
I'll leave that at that.	Emi yoo fi silẹ ni iyẹn.
I'll try later.	Emi yoo gbiyanju nigba miiran.
I asked him what he would do.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ pe kini yoo ṣe.
Sometimes the same room as would be outdated.	Nigba miiran yara kanna bi yoo ti wa ni igba atijọ.
One day he called me to his office.	Ni ọjọ kan o pe mi si ọfiisi rẹ.
As he pulled his legs in he noticed her.	Bi o ti fa awọn ẹsẹ rẹ sinu o ṣe akiyesi rẹ.
Many are interested in knowing what you have to say.	Ọpọlọpọ ni o nifẹ lati mọ ohun ti o ni lati sọ.
For this, there are two ways.	Fun eyi, awọn ọna meji lo wa.
They are not just.	Wọn kii ṣe o kan.
This is important and important.	Eyi ṣe pataki ati pataki.
This does not have to be a big deal.	Eyi ko ni lati jẹ adehun nla.
But it was only a promise of power.	Sugbon o je nikan ni ileri ti agbara.
Of course it is better to eat both.	Dajudaju o dara julọ lati jẹ mejeeji.
You just need to get the game there.	O kan nilo lati gba ere naa nibẹ.
There is nothing in the book about it.	Ko si nkankan ninu iwe nipa rẹ.
You should tell him that.	O yẹ ki o sọ fun u pe.
I did not ask.	Emi ko beere.
It just isn’t that easy.	Nikan kii ṣe pe o rọrun.
Turn the inside out.	Yipada ohun elo inu jade.
There is a mother there.	Iya kan wa nibẹ.
In fact, he should not be alone with me.	Ni otitọ, ko yẹ ki o wa nikan pẹlu mi.
I have not said a word to you.	Emi ko tii sọ ọrọ kan si ọ.
I see and understand what you write.	Mo rii ati loye ohun ti o kọ.
We have to continue.	A ni lati tẹsiwaju.
That work is not possible.	Iṣẹ yẹn ko ṣee ṣe.
And this is what you need to know.	Ati pe eyi ni ohun ti o nilo lati mọ.
I wear my daughters too.	Mo wọ awọn ọmọbirin mi pẹlu.
Puppies are human best friends.	Awọn ọmọ aja jẹ ọrẹ to dara julọ ti eniyan.
What to do.	Kini ohun ti o gbọdọ ṣe.
If they want to get something out of it, they can.	Ti wọn ba fẹ gba nkan lọwọ rẹ, wọn le.
But it's better.	Sugbon o dara ju.
We will need to look at it to think it.	A yoo nilo lati wo o lati ronu rẹ.
My husband decided to leave the marriage.	Ọkọ mi pinnu lati fi igbeyawo naa silẹ.
It can take a lot of time, of course.	O le gba akoko pupọ, dajudaju.
Remember the game.	Ranti ere naa.
I can see he is trying to get back to sleep.	Mo le rii pe o n gbiyanju lati pada si sun.
They have already started talking about it.	Wọn ti bẹrẹ sọrọ nipa rẹ tẹlẹ.
Read your story of life.	Ka rẹ itan ti aye.
Let's make some new friends.	Jẹ ki a ṣe awọn ọrẹ tuntun diẹ.
I killed him.	Mo pa a.
We must try to understand.	A gbọdọ gbiyanju lati ni oye.
It was always his name.	O je nigbagbogbo orukọ rẹ.
Make room about it.	Ṣe yara nipa rẹ.
This is it.	Eyi ni yii.
I know what a powerful thing it is.	Mo mọ ohun ti o ni agbara.
I doubt they are on it.	Mo ṣiyemeji ti wọn ba wa lori rẹ.
People can come to the father of whatever he wants'.	Eniyan le wa si baba ohunkohun ti o ba fẹ'.
Carry it through.	Gbe e nipasẹ.
I did enough for two.	Mo ti ṣe to fun meji.
I just locked myself in a room.	Mo kan tii ara mi sinu yara kan.
Observations on the past.	Awọn akiyesi lori akoko ti o kọja.
Okay, we can for a while.	O dara, a le fun igba diẹ.
We know this is a big stress on you.	A mọ pe eyi ti jẹ wahala nla lori rẹ.
I at least see so.	Mo ni o kere ri bẹ.
He is an amazing person.	O jẹ eniyan iyalẹnu.
Nor should it come from you.	Tabi ko yẹ ki o wa lati ọdọ rẹ.
Are you gone?	Njẹ o ti lọ bi?
I will kill them all.	Emi yoo pa gbogbo wọn.
But that is their goal.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ni ipinnu wọn lati ṣe.
He lives in the same house as me.	O ngbe ni ile kanna bi emi.
Either way, maybe this will make you feel better.	Ni ọna kan, boya eyi yoo jẹ ki o lero dara julọ.
I want to see.	Mo fe wo.
I mean, you know.	Mo tumọ si, o mọ.
And in a way right.	Ati ni ọna kan o tọ.
The world as they know it has changed.	Aye bi wọn ti mọ pe o ti yipada.
The area is known for its food.	A mọ agbegbe naa fun ounjẹ rẹ.
You don't want to call anyone.	O ko fẹ lati pe ẹnikẹni.
Okay, it doesn't seem like much.	O dara, ko dabi ẹni pe o fẹ pupọ.
You want to know all the facts.	O fẹ lati mọ gbogbo awọn otitọ.
I mean, when you were there.	Mo tumọ si, nigbati o wa nibẹ.
Not much benefit of that.	Ko Elo anfani ti ti.
Get your stuff, he said.	Gba nkan rẹ, o sọ.
He had two brothers who grew up to be men.	O ni awọn arakunrin meji ti o dagba lati di ọkunrin.
Music is the world.	Orin ni aye.
He hopes the trip will go well.	O nireti pe irin-ajo naa yoo lọ daradara.
And you have to get people.	Ati pe o ni lati gba eniyan.
We should not make a decision for ourselves.	A ko yẹ ki o ṣe ipinnu fun ara rẹ.
Why did you treat it? 	Kini idi ti o fi tọju rẹ?
It is more possible to get it with my help.	O ṣee ṣe diẹ sii lati gba rẹ pẹlu iranlọwọ mi.
But, it happens.	Ṣugbọn, ṣẹlẹ o ṣe.
They may have a week.	Wọn le ni ọsẹ kan.
I grew up in this area.	Mo dagba ni agbegbe yii.
Everything is still there, right now.	Ohun gbogbo tun wa, ni bayi.
Most of the time they just walk away.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba wọn kan rin kuro.
One word.	Ọrọ kan.
That will be one day.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ ọjọ kan.
I think you will know what that reason is.	Mo ro pe iwọ yoo mọ kini idi yẹn.
His life changed through.	Igbesi aye rẹ yi pada nipasẹ .
You have no imagination.	O ko ni oju inu.
In many cases you can do as you wish.	Ni ọpọlọpọ igba o le ṣe bi o ṣe fẹ.
It takes you on a journey in a way.	O gba ọ ni irin-ajo ni ọna kan.
Sure, he slept.	O daju pe, o sun.
He had been asleep for two hours.	O ti sun fun wakati meji.
Your true self.	Ara rẹ otitọ.
They told me not to tell anyone, not just one.	Wọn sọ fun mi pe ko sọ fun ẹnikẹni, kii ṣe ọkan kan.
You’re keeping a bad company.	O n tọju ile-iṣẹ buburu.
They are there.	Won ni nibẹ.
I will have a great time.	Emi yoo ni akoko ti o dara julọ.
And inside, there was.	Ati ninu, nibẹ wà.
They just won’t be able to hit or hold.	Wọn kan kii yoo ni anfani lati lu tabi mu.
Maybe that's what you want.	Boya ohun ti o fe ni.
I would think of it.	Emi yoo ronu rẹ.
They may not even be tomorrow.	Wọn le ma paapaa ni ọla.
I do not want to understand.	Emi ko fẹ lati ni oye.
There must be a book.	Iwe gbọdọ wa.
They talk for a long time.	Wọn sọrọ fun igba pipẹ.
You are gone.	O ti lọ.
He is on his way to school.	O wa lori ọna rẹ si ile-iwe.
They want to take their time.	Wọn fẹ lati gba akoko wọn.
I will not even eat.	Emi kii yoo jẹun paapaa.
I will help you in this.	Emi yoo ran ọ lọwọ ninu eyi.
I woke up late again.	Mo ji ni pẹ lẹẹkansi.
It took me a minute.	O gba mi iṣẹju kan.
To your home.	Si ile rẹ.
I thought about my situation.	Mo ro nipa ipo mi.
He has grown up.	O ti dagba soke.
I remember talking to you.	Mo ranti pe o sọrọ si ọ.
We washed before we knew.	A fo ki a to mọ.
You could say our area is.	O le sọ pe agbegbe wa ni.
Just going to get a little longer.	O kan lilọ lati gba diẹ to gun.
Now you can not know why.	Bayi ko le mọ idi rẹ.
We talk two or three times a month.	A sọrọ ni igba meji tabi mẹta ni oṣu kan.
You have to have a little time.	O ni lati ni akoko kekere.
We made a plan.	A ṣe eto kan.
Most of all, you don't need to touch again.	Pupọ julọ rẹ, ko nilo lati fi ọwọ kan lẹẹkansi.
I can now look ahead to my future.	Mo le ni bayi wo iwaju si ọjọ iwaju mi.
And as it turns out you will not.	Ati bi o ti wa ni jade o yoo ko.
But you want to understand this.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ ki o loye eyi.
I need to clear some of the stuff myself.	Mo nilo lati ko diẹ ninu nkan naa kuro funrararẹ.
Otherwise you will think.	Tabi ki o yoo ro.
They will talk more in the morning.	Wọn yoo sọrọ diẹ sii ni owurọ.
Great case.	Nla nla.
Now we do everything together.	Bayi a ṣe ohun gbogbo papọ.
The team is doing well.	Ẹgbẹ naa n ṣiṣẹ daradara.
The more I look at you the more I like you.	Bi mo ṣe n wo ọ diẹ sii ni MO ṣe fẹran rẹ diẹ sii.
I love everything you do.	Mo nifẹ ohun gbogbo ti o ṣe.
I wanted it to happen.	Mo ti fẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
It was obvious from his eyes.	O han gbangba lati oju rẹ.
Your body, the same.	Ara rẹ, kanna.
Most people are hurt.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ni ipalara.
You can get me, or not.	O le gba mi, tabi rara.
Tell me the whole story.	Sọ gbogbo itan naa fun mi.
He will have to think about this for a long time.	Oun yoo ni lati ronu nipa eyi fun igba pipẹ.
Make no mistake about it.	Maṣe ṣe aṣiṣe mi.
There is work to be done in the city.	Iṣẹ wa lati ṣe ni ilu.
There are two possible reasons for this.	Awọn idi meji ti o ṣee ṣe fun eyi.
See the world.	Wo aye.
He enjoys swimming in the ocean.	O gbadun odo ninu okun.
Now go leave me alone.	Bayi lọ fi mi silẹ nikan.
You need me.	O nilo mi.
Good at things like this.	O dara ni awọn nkan bii eyi.
This could be a big week for him in other ways.	Eyi le jẹ ọsẹ nla fun u ni awọn ọna miiran.
These values ​​were measured three times.	Awọn iye wọnyi ni a wọn ni igba mẹta.
At least that is the way it is in my heart.	O kere ju iyẹn ni ọna ti o wa ninu ọkan mi.
I do not even know how to get them.	Emi ko paapaa mọ bi a ṣe le gba wọn.
There is no room for that here.	Ko si aye fun iyẹn nibi.
Now you understand that.	Bayi o loye iyẹn.
They see them as good people.	Wọn wo wọn bi eniyan ti o dara.
I live in a small house.	Mo n gbe ni kekere kan ile.
Get the details inside.	Gba awọn alaye inu.
It is changing.	O n yipada.
Or a plan.	Tabi eto kan.
There is no way you can go beyond that.	Ko si ọna ti o le kọja eyi.
And that could mean a big deal.	Ati pe o le tumọ si adehun nla.
Try not to put one foot in the wrong.	Gbiyanju lati maṣe fi ẹsẹ kan si aṣiṣe.
He died again.	O ku lẹẹkansi.
You will enjoy it.	Iwọ yoo gbadun rẹ.
He went across the room.	O lọ kọja yara naa.
This is especially true in large cities.	Eyi ni pataki ni awọn ilu nla.
Everything belongs to one thing.	Ohun gbogbo jẹ ti nkan kan.
My eyes feel.	Oju mi ​​rilara.
I couldn’t be more wrong, honestly.	Emi ko le jẹ aṣiṣe diẹ sii, ni otitọ.
A person’s age is not a person’s date of birth.	Ọjọ ori eniyan kii ṣe ọjọ ibi eniyan.
Let sit for a few minutes.	Jẹ ki joko fun iṣẹju diẹ.
It is important to me.	O ṣe pataki fun mi.
However, we all know it is not, does not know.	Sibẹsibẹ, gbogbo wa mọ pe o ko, ko mọ.
I will not go into details, not here.	Emi kii yoo lọ sinu alaye, kii ṣe nibi.
Some of them are in the car.	Diẹ ninu wọn wa ninu ọkọ.
Only human trials.	Awọn idanwo eniyan nikan.
Some women earn higher wages.	Diẹ ninu awọn obinrin n gba owo ti o ga julọ.
Essentially at the same time of day.	Ni pataki ni akoko kanna ti ọjọ.
There are two ways to do this.	Awọn ọna meji lo wa lati ṣe.
It’s not that we get a lot.	Kii ṣe pe a gba ọpọlọpọ.
Space for the body, but there are simple ways.	Awọn aaye fun ara, ṣugbọn awọn ọna ti o rọrun wa.
You will be great.	Iwọ yoo jẹ nla.
Make some friends while you are here.	Ṣe diẹ ninu awọn ọrẹ nigba ti o ba wa nibi.
Some women know.	Awọn obinrin kan mọ.
Very difficult test.	Iṣoro idanwo pupọ.
We like to go on a little trip.	A fẹ lati lọ si irin-ajo kekere kan.
We just get it back yourself.	A kan gba pada funrararẹ.
And so it will.	Ati bẹ naa yoo.
History can teach us things.	Itan le kọ wa awọn nkan.
I read this often and it is hard not to accept.	Mo ka eyi nigbagbogbo ati pe o nira lati ma gba.
Please tell.	Jọwọ sọ gaan.
We can talk about it.	A le sọrọ nipa rẹ.
I am one of you.	Mo jẹ ọkan ninu yin.
All of these have made important plays.	Gbogbo awọn wọnyi ti ṣe awọn ere pataki.
Again, nothing happened there at all.	Lẹẹkansi, ko si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nibẹ paapaa.
He values ​​it too.	O si iye ti o ipo ju.
Their names say it all.	Orukọ wọn sọ gbogbo rẹ.
So don't say no !.	Nitorina maṣe sọ rara!.
Soon he came to her.	Laipẹ o wọ ọdọ ọdọ rẹ.
Very, very good.	Pupọ, dara pupọ.
You will remember that for a very long time.	O yoo ranti pe fun igba pipẹ pupọ.
You have a lot to think about.	O ni ọpọlọpọ lati ronu nipa.
Good weather is always here.	Oju ojo ti o dara nigbagbogbo wa nibi.
I grew well when they sent me.	Mo ti dagba daradara nigbati wọn ranṣẹ si mi.
See who they work for.	Wo ẹniti wọn ṣiṣẹ fun.
Everyone there knows this word.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o wa nibẹ mọ ọrọ yii.
You can also find a way.	O le tun wa ọna kan.
Just what you need.	O kan ohun ti o nilo.
That is a fact accepted.	Iyẹn jẹ otitọ kan gba.
I would have to move, take the kids out of school.	Emi yoo ni lati gbe, mu awọn ọmọde kuro ni ile-iwe.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.	Ti ko tọ, aṣiṣe, aṣiṣe.
It was so untrue.	O je ki ko otitọ.
This cannot be done by one man alone.	Eyi ko le ṣe nipasẹ ọkunrin kan nikan.
He wiped his face.	O nu oju re.
He does not talk often.	Ko sọrọ nigbagbogbo.
They know best.	Wọn mọ julọ.
Maybe together we can figure this out.	Boya papọ a le ro nkan yii jade.
Overnight at the restaurant, please do not.	Ni alẹ ni ile ounjẹ, jọwọ ma ṣe.
You are my son.	Iwọ ni ọmọkunrin mi.
That's why you will not.	Ti o ni idi ti o yoo ko.
Just the right amount of sweetness.	O kan ni iye to tọ ti dun.
Maybe there is a job.	Boya iṣẹ kan wa.
We have locked our doors.	A ti ti ilẹkun wa.
Their stories are important.	Awọn itan wọn ṣe pataki.
Nothing seemed to scare him.	Ko si ohun ti o dabi enipe o bẹru rẹ.
The status agreement should never be terminated.	Adehun ipo yẹ ko pari rara.
Essentially, we need to call someone about this.	Ni pataki, a nilo lati pe ẹnikan nipa eyi.
But you will love it.	Ṣugbọn iwọ yoo nifẹ rẹ.
That was interesting.	Ti o je awon.
There are a lot of people on the beach.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan lo wa lori eti okun.
There is nothing.	Ko si ohun kan wa.
We think we have a good story to tell.	A ro pe a ni itan ti o dara julọ lati sọ.
I need you to marry me.	Mo ni ki o fe mi.
I would like to do the same.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ṣe ni ọna kanna.
Some of my clothes are included.	Diẹ ninu awọn aṣọ mi wa ninu.
But he thought about them.	Ṣugbọn o ronu nipa wọn.
In fact he died last week.	Ni otitọ o ku ni ọsẹ to kọja.
Wrong.	Ko tọ si.
We slept the first time.	A sun oorun akoko akọkọ.
This kind of love one too.	Iru ife yi ọkan ju.
How do you both know.	Bawo ni awọn mejeeji ṣe mọ.
They agree on many details.	Wọn gba lori ọpọlọpọ awọn alaye.
He was unable to get up on his seat.	Ko ni agbara lati dide lori ijoko rẹ.
It's too hot.	O tun gbona.
It is possible that he was very truthful to himself.	O ṣee ṣe pe o jẹ otitọ pupọ si ararẹ.
Get out of my car!	Jade kuro ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi!
I love this game.	Mo nifẹ ere yii.
You can do this job if you really try.	O le ṣe iṣẹ yii ti o ba gbiyanju gaan.
I will come back to pick you up.	Emi yoo pada wa lati gbe ọ.
You have to leave the house.	O ni lati lọ kuro ni ile naa.
They have the highest potential.	Wọn ni agbara ti o ga julọ.
He completely abandoned me.	O fi mi silẹ patapata.
And you never know.	Ati pe o ko mọ.
However, nothing moved.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko si ohun ti o gbe.
When you want.	Nigbati o ba fẹ.
She is with her mother.	O wa pẹlu iya rẹ.
Maybe that's it.	Boya iyẹn ni.
I asked him what that meant.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ kini iyẹn tumọ si.
I don't want you to be angry with him.	Emi ko fẹ ki o binu si i.
He will never ask you again.	Oun ko ni beere lọwọ rẹ lẹẹkansi.
You can not tell me where to live and where not to live.	O ko le so fun mi ibi ti lati gbe ati ibi ti ko ba gbe.
Please tell me not to.	Jọwọ sọ fun mi kii ṣe eyi.
Consider children from their mother.	Ro awọn ọmọ lati iya wọn.
They don’t get much of it either.	Wọn ko gba pupọ ninu boya.
I do not know for how long.	Emi ko mọ fun igba melo.
It’s not just my job.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ mi nikan.
You do not have to think anything.	O ko ni lati ro ohunkohun.
Your story is not interesting at all.	Itan rẹ ko dun rara.
Stand by Me.	Duro pẹlu mi.
Or my work.	Tabi iṣẹ mi.
What can it be	Kini o le jẹ
But only physically, as it were.	Sugbon nikan ni ara, bi o ti wà.
I do not know anything.	Nko mo nkankan.
Just look inside you so much to leave the schools.	O kan wo inu rẹ pupọ lati lọ kuro ni awọn ile-iwe.
There is absolutely nothing to be done.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣee ṣe gaan.
Most buildings are two or three storeys high.	Pupọ awọn ile jẹ ile giga meji tabi mẹta.
He thought it would hurt.	O ro pe yoo ṣe ipalara.
When he does not find us he will call.	Nigbati ko ba ri wa yoo pe.
Lots of time on the phone.	Pupọ akoko lori foonu.
Today, there is a lot of money.	Loni, ọpọlọpọ owo wa.
Okay, that did for me.	O dara, iyẹn ṣe fun mi.
I see what it takes.	Mo rii ohun ti o n gba.
We are angry at the people who have been left behind.	A binu si awọn eniyan ti a ti fi silẹ.
He will be very angry.	Oun yoo binu gaan.
We made a lot of mistakes.	A ṣe aṣiṣe pupọ.
It will not use the word itself.	Kii yoo lo ọrọ naa funrararẹ.
You expect more from him.	O reti diẹ lati ọdọ rẹ.
You have to move the bed with, or do without.	O ni lati gbe ibusun pẹlu, tabi ṣe laisi.
It's very simple.	O rọrun pupọ.
This is fast.	Eleyi jẹ sare.
The first part of the game is for me.	Ere akọkọ ti ere naa jẹ fun mi.
With water and back to a day when the water was gone.	Pẹlu omi ati pada si ọjọ kan nigbati omi ti lọ.
They have said this many times.	Wọn ti sọ eyi ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
I will not allow you to stop it.	Emi kii yoo gba ọ laaye lati da a duro.
And think about it.	Ati ki o ronu nipa rẹ.
They look at each other for a long time.	Wọn wo ara wọn fun igba pipẹ.
Obviously you need this holiday season.	O han ni o nilo akoko isinmi yii.
The heat is on.	Ooru naa ga.
Just come.	O kan wa.
Some days you feel better than others.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọjọ ti o lero dara ju awọn miiran.
Even now he kills my children.	Paapaa ni bayi o pa awọn ọmọ mi.
Love begins in marriage.	Ifẹ bẹrẹ ni igbeyawo.
Please pay me.	Jọwọ san mi ni owo.
This is your position.	Eyi ni ipo rẹ.
If anyone can take it off.	Ti ẹnikan ba le mu u kuro.
He rose.	O dide.
He started working in music.	O bẹrẹ iṣẹ ni orin.
He will.	Oun yoo.
I do not see anything.	Nko wo nkankan.
Cities in the city have been evacuated.	Awọn ilu ti o wa ni ilu naa ti yọ kuro.
You have to learn how to eat.	O ni lati kọ ẹkọ bi o ṣe le jẹun.
It will not work, he said.	Kii yoo ṣiṣẹ, o sọ.
Get my name right.	Gba orukọ mi tọ.
But that doesn’t matter with power at hand.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣe pataki pẹlu agbara ni ọwọ.
That day, he asked what they wanted.	Ọjọ naa, o beere kini wọn fẹ.
I get you one.	Mo gba ọ ọkan.
There are some points that cannot be jumped and will not be jumped.	Awọn aaye kan wa ti a ko le fo ati pe kii yoo fo.
I can see them.	Mo le rii wọn.
It's my job.	Iṣẹ mi ni.
I like it here.	Mo fẹ rẹ nibi.
It is their job to do this.	O jẹ iṣẹ wọn lati ṣe eyi.
They were living at that time.	Wọn n gbe ni akoko yẹn.
I'm happy for him.	Inu mi dun fun u.
I just want a dog.	Mo kan fẹ aja kan.
It was great with the baby.	O jẹ nla pẹlu ọmọ naa.
I have seen my wife and son.	Mo ti ri iyawo mi ati ọmọ mi.
He kept his eyes on the girl.	O si pa oju rẹ mọ si ọmọbirin naa.
We do not already have this.	A ko ni eyi tẹlẹ.
Only this time, the sun will not come.	Ni akoko yii nikan, oorun kii yoo wa.
This is done for several reasons.	Eyi ni a ṣe fun awọn idi pupọ.
That doesn't sound good.	Iyẹn ko dun.
No heat.	Ko si ooru.
I don’t plan any of that at all.	Emi ko gbero eyikeyi iyẹn rara.
The work was completed before nightfall.	Iṣẹ naa ti pari ṣaaju alẹ.
Something caught my eye.	Nkankan mu oju mi.
You don't need one.	Ko nilo ọkan.
My room is small.	Yara mi kere.
I have never been afraid in my life.	Emi ko bẹru rara ni igbesi aye mi.
The details do not really matter.	Awọn alaye ko ṣe pataki ni otitọ.
And repeat.	Ki o si tun ṣe.
You agree to accept the offer.	O gba lati gba iṣẹ naa.
We have become friends.	A ti di ọrẹ.
Sure, they lose, but they look great.	Daju, wọn padanu, ṣugbọn wọn dabi nla.
The sister must have taken time off work too.	Arabinrin naa gbọdọ ni lati gba akoko isinmi iṣẹ paapaa.
And family, of course.	Ati ebi, dajudaju.
We should not let it even.	A ko yẹ ki o jẹ ki o le paapaa.
I don't want it to be.	Emi ko fẹ ki o wa.
You want to have a child to love.	O fẹ pe o ni ọmọ lati nifẹ.
He’s out of his mouth.	O n ti ẹnu rẹ jade.
If any, ignore them.	Ti eyikeyi ba wa, ko ṣe akiyesi wọn.
There is enough for everyone.	Nibẹ ni to fun gbogbo eniyan.
That test found no problems.	Idanwo yẹn ko ri awọn iṣoro kankan.
Bring him back to his bed for the night.	Mu u pada si ibusun rẹ fun alẹ.
It could be the local police.	O le jẹ awọn ọlọpa agbegbe.
I want to walk.	Mo fe rin.
And he will go to.	Ati pe yoo lo si.
She is doing well.	O n ṣe daradara.
I really hate myself.	Mo korira ara mi gaan.
This is away from your eyes.	Eleyi jẹ kuro lati oju rẹ.
This was the last leg of my trip.	Eyi ni ẹsẹ ikẹhin ti irin-ajo mi.
It seems impossible.	O dabi ẹni pe ko ṣee mu.
That only makes it harder.	Iyẹn nikan mu ki o wa le.
I was dropped off recently.	Wọn ti gbe mi silẹ laipẹ.
That’s there to stay.	Iyẹn wa lati duro.
He received his degree last year.	O gba oye rẹ ni ọdun to kọja.
He picked up the book.	O mu iwe naa.
Obviously there is more for me to see.	O han gbangba pe diẹ sii wa fun mi lati rii.
That is why it appears first.	Ti o ni idi ti o han akọkọ.
Everything you do, you do well.	Ohun gbogbo ti o ṣe, o ṣe daradara.
I think you should go to him one last time.	Mo ro pe o yẹ ki o lọ si ọdọ rẹ ni igba ikẹhin.
This is the only known image.	Eyi ni aworan ti a mọ nikan.
This is for you, son.	Eyi ni fun ọ, ọmọ.
Not in it, not near it.	Ko si ninu rẹ, nitosi rẹ.
You know, something beautiful.	O mọ, nkan ti o lẹwa.
But jump down.	Ṣugbọn fo si isalẹ.
It has some advantages, but it takes a long time.	O ni diẹ ninu awọn anfani, ṣugbọn o gba igba pipẹ.
You don’t want everyone to know about it.	O ko fẹ ki gbogbo eniyan mọ nipa rẹ.
But that is not the case.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe.
I have it.	Mo ni re.
But it is not like that.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe bii rẹ.
Why didn't you tell us about it?	Kilode ti o ko sọ fun wa nipa rẹ?
I enjoyed it.	Mo gbadun re.
In many cases.	Ni ọpọlọpọ awọn igba.
I can also.	Mo tun le.
We will see how this year goes.	A o rii bi ọdun yii yoo ṣe lọ.
You know that no one will believe you if you tell them.	O mọ pe ko si ẹnikan ti yoo gbagbọ ti o ba sọ fun wọn.
All that stuff is there.	Gbogbo nkan yẹn wa nibẹ.

A big dog can be faster than a small dog.	Aja nla le sare ju aja kekere lọ.
And so, but hard to get.	Ati bẹ, ṣugbọn gidigidi lati gba.
I love it so much.	Mo nifẹ rẹ pupọ.
You may not know for sure, but you believe.	O ko le mọ daju daju, ṣugbọn o gbagbọ.
Just a dog.	O kan aja.
Someone good to do something soon.	Ẹnikan dara lati ṣe nkan laipẹ.
You may not know what happened to him.	O le ma mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si i.
We are too late.	A ti pẹ ju.
My brother will not talk to you.	Arakunrin mi kii yoo ba ọ sọrọ.

It was about everything.	O je nipa ohun gbogbo.
You have to take what life gives you.	O ni lati mu ohun ti igbesi aye yoo fun ọ.
This thing must stop.	Nkan yi gbọdọ da.
It is very hot.	Ooru pupọ wa.
The hour is over.	Wakati naa ti kọja.
That's your business.	Iṣẹ́ rẹ̀ niyẹn.
He talks about the many ways in which a person helps to make better decisions.	O sọrọ lori ọpọlọpọ awọn ọna ti o ṣe iranlọwọ fun eniyan lati ṣe awọn ipinnu to dara julọ.
Write a letter to help your family.	Kọ lẹta kan lati ran idile rẹ lọwọ.
I will let myself out.	Emi yoo jẹ ki ara mi jade.
And that is what will make me human.	Ati pe ohun ti yoo sọ mi di eniyan.
It will improve.	Yoo dara si.
It is a great opportunity for you.	Anfani nla ni fun yin.
This cannot be stopped now.	Eyi ko le da duro ni bayi.
You know when it is.	O mọ nigbati o jẹ.
He made his way to class.	O ṣe ọna rẹ si kilasi.
I get the feeling that the person is really special.	Mo gba rilara pe eniyan naa jẹ pataki gaan.
I will repay you.	Emi yoo san pada fun ọ.
Where no one can see.	Ibi ti ko si ọkan le ri.
You have not seen them for a long time.	O ti ko wo wọn fun igba pipẹ.
We had a hard time getting here.	A ni akoko lile lati de ibi.
The sun will rise again.	Oorun yoo tun jade.
However, enough for now.	Sibẹsibẹ, to fun bayi.
Please clean the table.	Jọwọ nu tabili naa.
But that is not true.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	O dabi ẹni pe o ya.
I think there is a mistake here.	Mo ro pe aṣiṣe kan wa nibi.
I had not seen him there that night.	Emi ko tii ri i nibẹ ni alẹ yẹn.
If you haven’t heard, they’re really good.	Ti o ko ba ti gbọ, wọn dara gaan.
You have seen cars there before.	O ti rii awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ nibẹ tẹlẹ.
Wait for it.	Duro fun o.
Okay, it looks like it worked.	O dara, o dabi pe o ti ṣiṣẹ.
Behind this house is a train station.	Lẹhin ile yii ni ibudo ọkọ oju irin.
They want to change.	Wọn fẹ lati yipada.
I can feel it.	Mo le rilara.
Very good !.	O dara pupọ!.
But it also does not matter.	Sugbon o tun ko ni pataki.
He rejected everyone's opinion.	O kọ imọran gbogbo eniyan.
And a lot of it if we can get it.	Ati ọpọlọpọ rẹ ti a ba le gba.
You know how to change yourself.	O mọ bi o ṣe le yi ara rẹ pada.
I knocked on the door.	Mo ti ilẹkun lati ita.
They did not miss a single day for three years.	Wọn ko padanu ọjọ kan fun ọdun mẹta.
Even in his sleep, he knew where he lived.	Paapaa ninu oorun rẹ, o mọ ibi ti o ngbe.
You have to have that.	O ni lati ni iyẹn.
He will kill himself, he will kill us all.	Oun yoo pa ara rẹ, yoo pa gbogbo wa.
If you have anything to worry about.	Ti o ba jẹ ohunkohun ti o ṣe aniyan nipa.
Not all information, but important.	Kii ṣe gbogbo alaye, ṣugbọn pataki.
We are looking for more money.	A n wa owo diẹ sii.
Eyes are the key.	Oju ni bọtini.
He thought he was dead.	O ro pe o ti ku.
I do not really remember.	Emi ko ranti gaan.
But can't, not yet.	Ṣugbọn ko le, ko sibẹsibẹ.
You have to get rid of this stuff.	O ni lati lọ kuro ni nkan yii.
All my children work there.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọ mi ṣiṣẹ nibẹ.
At least let me look at the letter for myself.	O kere ju jẹ ki n wo lẹta naa fun ara mi.
But he went back to sleep in the car.	Ṣugbọn o pada lọ sun ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
I really agree.	Mo gba gaan.
Another day did.	Ọjọ miiran ṣe.
But that is not the deal.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe adehun naa.
Without history, there is no future.	Laisi itan, ko si ojo iwaju.
I should use the best word.	Mo yẹ ki o lo ọrọ ti o dara julọ.
But they are there.	Ṣugbọn wọn wa nibẹ.
I'm too late.	Mo ti pẹ ju.
Friends make a special point.	Ọrẹ ṣe aaye pataki kan.
It'd not be good.	O fẹ ko dara.
No one is in sight.	Ko si eniyan kan ni oju.
We do not really believe you need them.	A ko gbagbọ gaan pe o nilo wọn.

He said he would let her go after it was over.	O sọ pe oun yoo jẹ ki o lọ lẹhin ti o ba pari.
I want to hear more about the range.	Mo fẹ lati gbọ diẹ sii nipa ibiti o ti wa.
Children grow up and parents grow up.	Awọn ọmọde dagba ati awọn obi dagba.
You don’t think about what you’re doing.	O ko ronu nipa ohun ti o n ṣe.
But no, you have to help yourself.	Ṣugbọn rara, o ni lati ran ara rẹ lọwọ.

Many things do not work as well as they did before.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan ko ṣiṣẹ daradara bi wọn ti ṣe tẹlẹ.
Two rooms and a shower.	Yara meji ati iwe.

And yet he carried it.	Ati sibẹsibẹ o gbe e.
Their dinner is over.	Ounjẹ alẹ wọn ti pari.
But they are good as they are now.	Ṣugbọn wọn dara bi ko si ni bayi.

However, it is not very difficult.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko nira pupọ.
Trees grow on both sides of the road.	Awọn igi dagba ni ẹgbẹ mejeeji ti ọna naa.

I enjoyed it and learned a lot.	Mo gbadun rẹ ati kọ ẹkọ pupọ.
He is waiting.	O n duro de.
It's not.	Kii ṣe.
It is not the right thing to do.	Kii ṣe ohun ti o tọ lati ṣe.
He returned it, but it seemed to be forced.	O da a pada, ṣugbọn o dabi enipe o fi agbara mu.
That same morning, he told me.	Ni owurọ kanna, o sọ fun mi.
Sorry to see you go.	Ma binu lati ri ti o lọ.
That would be very similar to you.	Iyẹn yoo dabi iwọ pupọ.
What else can you do.	Kini ohun miiran ti o le ṣe.
This means we do not have an office.	Eyi tumọ si pe a ko ni ọfiisi.
You are wrong.	O ṣe aṣiṣe.
I do not know what you have up to.	Emi ko mo ohun ti o ni soke si.
It is either that or stop the area on the road.	O jẹ boya iyẹn tabi da agbegbe duro ni opopona.
You cannot use both at the same time.	O ko le lo awọn mejeeji ni akoko kanna.
He should not have done so.	Ko yẹ ki o ti ṣe bẹ naa.
What you do matters.	Ohun ti o ṣe ṣe pataki.
That has to be what we need to do.	Iyẹn ni lati jẹ ohun ti a nilo lati ṣe.
We are in town in the next two days.	A wa ni ilu ni awọn ọjọ meji ti nbọ.
No one's face.	Ko si oju ẹnikan.

In fact, most people believe that this will happen.	Ni otitọ, ọpọlọpọ eniyan gbagbọ pe eyi yoo ṣẹlẹ.
They have too much to lose.	Won ni pupo ju lati padanu.
In the back.	Ni ẹhin.

I have them, but not without much work.	Mo ni wọn, ṣugbọn kii ṣe laisi iṣẹ pupọ.
It is before and after.	O wa ṣaaju ati lẹhin.
It can make your imagination grow.	O le jẹ ki oju inu rẹ dagba.
We hope you enjoy it !!!.	A nireti pe o gbadun rẹ !!!.
I was killed.	Mo ti pa.
It can be over everyone.	O ti le lori gbogbo eniyan.
He seems to have not slept at night.	O dabi ẹni pe ko sun ni alẹ.
I understand what you are saying.	Mo loye ohun ti o n sọ.
I can't sleep.	Nko le sare.
I would not eat anything without it.	Emi kii yoo jẹ nkankan laisi rẹ.

He said to himself that he was in trouble.	O sọ funrararẹ pe o ni wahala.
But he is on his way.	Ṣugbọn o wa lori ọna rẹ.
But works are not the whole story.	Ṣugbọn awọn iṣẹ kii ṣe gbogbo itan.
You can give.	O le fun ni.
So, what kind of father is he?	Nitorina, iru baba wo ni o jẹ?
Have a boy about his age.	Ni ọmọkunrin kan nipa ọjọ ori rẹ.
You don’t want anything to go wrong tonight.	O ko fẹ ohunkohun lati ṣe aṣiṣe ni alẹ oni.
What you will not put a word to.	Ohun ti o yoo ko fi ọrọ si.
There is nothing that you can do to improve your lot in life.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣe ti yoo mu ipo rẹ dara si ni igbesi aye.

It consisted of two breakfast and three lunches.	O jẹ ounjẹ owurọ meji ati ounjẹ ọsan mẹta.
They will not change.	Wọn kii yoo yipada.

The journey is high.	Irin-ajo naa ga.

As such, it may contain errors.	Bi iru bẹẹ, o le ni awọn aṣiṣe ninu.
They have to move.	Wọn ni lati gbe.

He returned to his lunch.	O pada si ounjẹ ọsan rẹ.
We do not need to do so here.	A ko nilo lati ṣe bẹ nibi.
Things are not good in this thing.	Awọn nkan ko dara ni nkan yii.
This program will only work for a limited time.	Eto yii yoo ṣiṣẹ fun igba diẹ nikan.
I hold myself.	Mo di ara mi mu.
And you will be better off, too.	Ati pe iwọ yoo dara julọ, paapaa.
Let us tell them.	Jẹ ki a sọ fun wọn pe.
Nice to meet you.	O dara julọ pe o wa pẹlu mi.
Look at your parents.	Wo awọn obi rẹ.

We should go out.	A yẹ ki o jade.
All you have to do is test.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ni lati ṣe ni idanwo.
Wait a minute.	Duro ni iṣẹju kan.

It makes a good sense.	O ṣe oye ti o dara.
He will ask.	Yoo beere.

I would hope to enjoy it more again.	Emi yoo nireti lati gbadun rẹ diẹ sii lẹẹkansi.
Leave one of your men here.	Fi ọkan ninu awọn ọkunrin rẹ silẹ nibi.
Worth it.	O tọ si.
Good to see things.	O dara lati wo awọn nkan.
You have to keep it and not let it out in public.	O gbọdọ pa a mọ ki o ma ṣe jẹ ki o jade ni gbangba.
This can be a huge force.	Eyi le jẹ agbara nla.
There is nothing special about it, that is just what happened.	Ko si o jẹ ohunkohun pataki nipa o, ti o jẹ o kan ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
We took it was not.	A si mu o je ko.
How one works.	Bawo ni ọkan ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
If you do not find it, you may not get it.	Ti o ko ba ri, o ṣee ṣe ki o ma gba.
If nothing else, that is.	Ti ko ba si nkan miiran, iyẹn ni.
There are two things.	Nkan meji ni.
This is not how it works.	Eyi kii ṣe bii o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
I can agree with that.	Mo le gba pẹlu iyẹn.
This does not work.	Eyi ko ṣiṣẹ.
He can not beat it.	Ko le lu o.
They have low prices.	Won ni kekere owo.

That’s a lot.	Iyẹn jẹ pupọ.
He was a member.	O jẹ ọmọ ẹgbẹ kan.
The same thing can happen here.	Ohun kanna le ṣẹlẹ nibi.
This can take time.	Eyi le ṣe akoko.
But other people will not.	Ṣugbọn awọn eniyan miiran kii yoo.
It is almost nothing.	O fẹrẹ jẹ ohunkohun.
Every minute is important.	Gbogbo iṣẹju ni pataki.
He was in agreement.	O si wà ni adehun.
All lights are tested.	Gbogbo awọn ina ni idanwo.
Nice to meet you.	Inu mi dun lati pade yin.

I even wrote about it in books.	Mo paapaa kọ nipa rẹ sinu awọn iwe.
They love music.	Wọn nifẹ orin.

You read a lot.	O ka pupọ.
This is a great deal.	Eyi jẹ adehun nla.
I agree with you.	Mo gba pẹlu rẹ.
I especially like women to touch me.	Mo nifẹ paapaa awọn obinrin lati fi ọwọ kan mi.
I wish you and your best.	Mo fẹ ki iwọ ati rẹ dara julọ.
Open me to see your love for me.	Ṣi mi lati ri ifẹ rẹ si mi.
We have grown as a team through every game.	A ti dagba bi ẹgbẹ nipasẹ gbogbo ere.
You better keep them.	O dara ki o tọju wọn.
The woman hurried to the train station.	Obinrin naa sare lọ si ibudo ọkọ oju irin.
Finish in my life.	Pari ninu aye mi.
I told him this last.	Mo ti so fun u yi kẹhin.
The sun of the house.	Oorun ti ile.
The weather will be tomorrow.	Oju ojo yoo wa ni ọla.
For her they were all good things in her life.	Fun rẹ wọn jẹ ohun gbogbo ti o dara ni igbesi aye rẹ.
Can't ask for more, can you ?.	Ko le beere fun diẹ sii, ṣe o le ?.
He stood outside.	O duro ni ita.
I hope that is good.	Mo nireti pe iyẹn dara.
Tomorrow there will be a lot more to see.	Ọla yoo wa pupọ diẹ sii lati rii.
He did not want to hear the details.	Ko fẹ lati gbọ awọn alaye.
He drove a small car.	O wakọ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kekere kan.
We are very.	A jẹ pupọ.
Ask the question after the question.	Beere ibeere lẹhin ibeere naa.
Maybe you do.	Boya o ṣe.
He wants to see.	O fe wo.
He does not know what it is.	Ko mọ ohun ti o jẹ mọ.
It has to start in two days time.	O ni lati bẹrẹ ni akoko ọjọ meji.
We will talk about it tomorrow.	A yoo sọrọ nipa rẹ ni ọla.
She wanted to look good for him.	O fe lati wo dara fun u.
This is for many reasons.	Eyi jẹ nitori ọpọlọpọ awọn idi.
It is hot.	Ojo gbona ni.
It is their life.	O jẹ igbesi aye wọn.
They are all dressed in costume.	Gbogbo wọn ni wọ́n wọ aṣọ ọ̀wọ̀.
I’m not sure how many of them really think about making it.	Emi ko ni idaniloju bi ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn ṣe ronu nipa ṣiṣe rẹ gaan.
Young people want to be able to take places.	Awọn ọdọ fẹ lati ni anfani lati gba awọn aaye.
That will happen, that will happen.	Iyẹn yoo ṣẹlẹ, iyẹn yoo ṣẹlẹ.
But the law is the law.	Ṣugbọn ofin ni ofin.
They will not give it to us.	Wọn kii yoo fi fun wa.
We do not do so now.	A ko ṣe bẹ ni bayi.
In as many cars as it is now.	Ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ bi o ti wa ni bayi.
With good ideas.	Pẹlu awọn ero ti o dara julọ.
And it is not an easy task.	Ati pe kii ṣe iṣẹ ti o rọrun.
What people want.	Ohun ti eniyan fẹ.
I wish her a long career.	Mo fẹ rẹ a gun ọmọ.
He made a living in it.	O ṣe igbesi aye ni rẹ.
But that’s about it, not about the family.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ nipa rẹ, kii ṣe nipa idile.
Than it is now.	Ju o wa ni bayi.
I have it working.	Mo ni o ṣiṣẹ.
If you can see what that means.	Ti o ba le rii kini iyẹn tumọ si.
They need to be ahead.	Wọn nilo lati wa ni iwaju.
The price was good just to have.	Awọn owo je dara o kan lati ni.
Everyone talked about it, but no one did anything.	Gbogbo eniyan ti sọrọ nipa rẹ, ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe ohunkohun.
I tried it.	Mo ti gbiyanju o.
Only known to you.	Ibi ti a mọ si ọ nikan.
I made a mistake at some point, however.	Mo ṣe aṣiṣe rẹ ni aaye kan, sibẹsibẹ.
I live in a house, you see.	Mo n gbe ile, o ri.
There is no way to talk to anyone.	Ko si ọna ti o sọrọ si ẹnikẹni.
Now we will give them one.	Bayi a yoo fun wọn ni ọkan.
They went at night.	Wọn lọ ni alẹ.
This is especially true of the song.	Eyi jẹ otitọ paapaa ti orin naa.
They don’t want to work with a woman.	Wọn ko fẹ ṣiṣẹ pẹlu obinrin kan.
He refused to talk to me.	O kọ lati ba mi sọrọ.
It is not that you need help with your heart.	Kii ṣe pe o nilo iranlọwọ pẹlu ọkan rẹ.
Not that he will but yet.	Kii ṣe pe oun yoo ṣugbọn sibẹsibẹ.
Not what you think.	Kii ṣe ohun ti o ro.
They want us to be surprised.	Wọn fẹ ki a ya wa ni iyalẹnu.
With their child in it.	Pẹlu ọmọ wọn ninu rẹ.
They need to run around.	Wọn nilo lati sare ni ayika.
The trouble did not last long.	Wahala naa ko pẹ.
Maybe it is.	Boya o jẹ.
It has not changed in the last few months.	Ko ti yipada ni awọn oṣu diẹ sẹhin.
You have to beat this.	O ni lati lu eyi.
You say, it must be so.	O sọ, o gbọdọ jẹ bẹ.
At this point, you can see your face.	Ni akoko yii, o le rii oju rẹ.
You should do so.	O yẹ ki o ṣe bẹ.
The power of water surrounds itself.	Agbara omi yi ara re.
It helps him to get rid of.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun u lati yọ kuro.
That should not be the case.	Ko yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ bẹ.
Together, they have a daughter.	Papọ, wọn ni ọmọbirin kan.
It is only for walking.	O wa nikan fun rin.
Where is my mistake?	Nibo ni aṣiṣe mi wa.
And so we did.	Ati bẹ a ṣe.
In conclusion, this is not enough.	Ni ipinnu, eyi ko pe.
I don’t think we are all up.	Emi ko ro pe gbogbo wa ni oke.
I took the dog.	Mo gba aja naa.
We do this to learn.	A ṣe eyi lati kọ ẹkọ.
Let's go back.	Jẹ ki a pada.
He says people can no longer do the same things.	O sọ pe eniyan ko le ṣe awọn nkan kanna mọ.
It was not just work for him, but also fun.	O je ko o kan ise fun u, sugbon tun fun.
You have done it for a long time.	O ti ṣe e fun igba pipẹ.
He waited for a few minutes, but no one came.	O duro fun iṣẹju diẹ, ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o wa.
You love it here.	O fẹran rẹ nibi.
I just asked him something.	Mo kan beere lọwọ rẹ nkankan.
Everyone knows that winter is the coldest winter.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ pe igba otutu jẹ akoko otutu julọ.
I think that's the point.	Mo ro pe ọrọ wa niyẹn.
It may be yours, just finished.	O le jẹ tirẹ, o kan ti pari.
It is legal, and it is very surprising to them.	O jẹ ofin, ati pe o jẹ iyalẹnu pupọ wọn.
You can also leave now.	O tun le fi silẹ ni bayi.
But that was not all.	Sugbon ti o je ko gbogbo.
Arrived there.	Ti dide nibẹ.
The ear, we see, has to be hard.	Eti, a rii, ni lati jẹ lile.
You are looking for something.	Nkankan lo n wa.
It’s kind of what we’re doing out there.	O jẹ iru ohun ti a n ṣe jade.
He believed he was dead.	O gbagbọ pe o ti ku.
Just down the road.	Kan si isalẹ ni opopona.
I am very worried about it.	Emi ni aniyan pupọ nipa rẹ.
However, the information may be incorrect.	Sibẹsibẹ, alaye naa le jẹ aṣiṣe.
Roads are full this morning.	Awọn opopona ti kun ni owurọ yii.
In fact it is more possible than the book itself.	Ni otitọ o ṣee ṣe ju iwe naa lọ funrararẹ.
But we will be there for him.	Ṣugbọn a yoo wa nibẹ fun u.
It’s not that he doesn’t use shoes.	Kii ṣe pe ko lo bata.
I can't let that happen again.	Mi o le jẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
He hopes to be here for a while.	O nireti lati wa nibi fun igba diẹ.
But we stopped, first.	Ṣugbọn a da duro, akọkọ.
But something stopped me.	Sugbon nkankan duro mi.
It has been good to work for you.	O ti dara lati ṣiṣẹ fun ọ.
But they can use the money for other things first.	Ṣugbọn wọn le lo owo naa fun awọn ohun miiran ni akọkọ.
He stood there.	O duro nibẹ.
Nothing to expect.	Ko si nkankan lati reti.
They want something good.	Wọn fẹ nkan ti o dara.
Use from nothing.	Lo lati ohunkohun.
Some high school students came to find work.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọ ile-iwe giga wa lati wa iṣẹ.
He wanted my advice.	O fe imọran mi.
We can be better than that.	A le dara ju iyẹn lọ.
They have not been open in years.	Wọn ko ti ṣii ni awọn ọdun.
We returned home.	A pada si ile.
It has always been about it.	O ti nigbagbogbo nipa rẹ.
I, too, am afraid.	Emi naa, bẹru.
You want it to be true.	O fẹ ki o jẹ otitọ.
At the same time they must not leave anything for the world.	Ni akoko kanna wọn ko gbọdọ fi ohunkohun silẹ fun aye.
And he had me alone in front of him.	Ati pe o ni mi nikan ni iwaju rẹ.
We changed our view of the situation.	A yipada ero wa ti ipo naa.
Two in a row.	Meji ni ọna kan.
I know you are there.	Mo mọ pe o wa nibẹ.
I think you will be back here.	Mo ro o yoo wa ni pada nibi.
Always move around the garden.	Gbe ni ayika ọgba nigbagbogbo.
Life will try to restart down there.	Igbesi aye yoo gbiyanju lati tun bẹrẹ ni isalẹ nibẹ.
Maybe it’s also the reason their eyesight isn’t good.	Boya o tun jẹ idi ti oju wọn ti ko dara.
Some of them you like.	Diẹ ninu wọn ti o fẹran.
Fast off the edge on late pass games.	Sare si pa awọn eti lori pẹ kọja ere.
But more to life than just dying.	Ṣugbọn diẹ sii si igbesi aye ju ki a ma ku lọ.
And he is also my father.	Ati pe oun naa ni baba mi.
I'm sure.	O da mi loju.
We have been working on this kind of thing for two years.	A ti n ṣiṣẹ lori iru nkan yii fun ọdun meji.
Like yours, here.	Bi tirẹ, nibi.
I have never said so.	Emi ko tii sọ bẹẹ rara.
Don’t let it get out of your face.	Maṣe jẹ ki o jade kuro ni oju rẹ.
My body is one of them.	Ara mi jẹ ọkan ninu wọn.
Something you say can be very difficult.	Nkankan ti o sọ le pupọ.
I was told.	Mo ti so fun.
You can tell your father or your friends.	O le sọ fun baba rẹ tabi awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
They only take time.	Wọn gba aago nikan.
We hope you have a wonderful holiday!	A nireti pe o ni isinmi iyanu!
Teachers will be at work.	Awọn olukọ yoo wa ni iṣẹ.
There are also people who believe.	Awọn eniyan tun wa ti wọn gbagbọ.
He will see you for yourself.	Oun yoo ri ọ fun ara rẹ.
It can be anyone.	O le jẹ ẹnikẹni.
I love to play this game.	Mo ni ife lati mu ere yi.
You just do not understand these people.	O kan ko loye awọn eniyan wọnyi.
You know how to do it.	O mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe.
One or two can wait.	Ọkan tabi meji le duro.
We are of the same opinion.	A ni o wa ti kanna ero.
It seemed like a good idea.	O dabi enipe ero ti o dara julọ.
After a few minutes, he stepped back.	Lẹhin iṣẹju diẹ, o pada sẹhin.
I do not love you.	Emi kii ṣe ifẹ rẹ.
It was an accident.	O jẹ ijamba.
But of course that is not possible.	Ṣugbọn dajudaju iyẹn ko ṣee ṣe.
Those who refused were taken away.	Awọn ti o kọ ni a mu lọ.
It is probably there, too.	O ti wa ni jasi nibẹ, ju.
It's my birthday.	Ojo ibi ni.
Only up or down is available.	Oke tabi isalẹ nikan wa.
And that's a good thing.	Ati pe ohun to dara niyẹn.
Maybe they do.	Boya wọn ṣe.
Or make music.	Tabi ṣe orin.
People need jobs.	Eniyan nilo awọn iṣẹ.
Now you can know that your mother is gone.	Ni bayi o le mọ pe iya rẹ ti lọ.
And we will get you next year.	Ati pe a yoo gba ọ ni ọdun to nbọ.
That is what the truth means.	Ohun ti otitọ tumọ si niyẹn.
I do not like this method.	Emi ko fẹran ọna yii.
I am very easy to leave.	Mo rọrun pupọ lati fi silẹ.
Nothing of the cost.	Ko si ohun ti iye owo.
The car sped off.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa yara.
He did not want to.	Oun ko fẹ rara.
It is located near the port.	O ilu nitosi ibudo.
Or maybe it’s the boat itself.	Tabi boya o jẹ ọkọ oju omi funrararẹ.
My life, my rules.	Aye mi, awọn ofin mi.
I am continuing with a project.	Mo n tẹsiwaju pẹlu iṣẹ kan.
I see this all the time.	Mo rii eyi ni gbogbo igba.
This is the last year in school.	Eyi jẹ ọdun ti o kẹhin ni ile-iwe.
No need for money.	Ko si nilo fun owo.
The buildings have many high stories.	Awọn ile ni ọpọlọpọ awọn itan giga.
I know it's not me.	Mo mọ pe kii ṣe emi.
People are getting money from this project.	Awọn eniyan n gba owo lati inu iṣẹ yii.
It should only be there.	O yẹ ki o wa nibẹ nikan.
But perhaps the situation has really changed.	Ṣugbọn boya ipo naa ti yipada ni otitọ.
He knew we were friends.	O mọ pe a jẹ ọrẹ.
He did what he did.	O ṣe ohun ti o ṣe.
We just got out there and did it.	A kan ni jade nibẹ ati ki o ṣe o.
My mother is still here.	Iya mi si wa nibi.
He tells us he has not eaten anything these days.	O sọ fun wa pe oun ko jẹ ohunkohun ni awọn ọjọ.
They should also be treated.	Wọn tun yẹ ki o tọju.
No job ever made me happy.	Ko si ise ti o lailai ṣe mi dun.
Tell your friend to me.	Sọ fun ọrẹ rẹ fun mi.
That took my mother.	Iyẹn gba iya mi lọ.
We may miss the house.	A le padanu ile naa.
But, it could be wrong.	Ṣugbọn, o le jẹ aṣiṣe.
He looked at me.	O wo mi.
Let's go to your room.	Jẹ ki a lọ si yara rẹ.
I want it.	Mo fe ya.
They wonder what other people look like even.	Wọn ṣe iyalẹnu kini eniyan miiran dabi paapaa.
Legally, he was wrong.	Ni ofin, o ṣe aṣiṣe.
He lives for football only.	O n gbe fun bọọlu nikan.
Both sides sit at the same table.	Awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji joko ni tabili kanna.
As with anything, you get what you pay for.	Bi pẹlu ohunkohun, o gba ohun ti o san fun.
I'll tell him you're not here.	Emi yoo sọ fun u pe iwọ ko si nibi.
They want to take pictures.	Wọn fẹ lati ya awọn aworan.
Changed, of course, but still beautiful.	Yi pada, dajudaju, sugbon si tun lẹwa.
The ball came to me, and so on.	Bọọlu naa wa si ọdọ mi, ati bẹ naa.
I'm not feeling well in my life.	Nko ko rilara dara rara ninu aye mi.
It just isn’t there.	O kan ko wa nibẹ.
Most young people go to sleep first.	Pupọ julọ awọn ọdọ ti o lọ sun oorun akọkọ.
But we do not have to.	Sugbon a ko ni lati.
I think you can tell me not to go.	Mo ro pe o le sọ fun mi pe ko lọ.
I think this is what we should expect.	Mo ro pe eyi ni ohun ti a yẹ ki o reti.
It is educational, in and of itself.	O jẹ ẹkọ, ni ati funrararẹ.
That was a good day.	Iyẹn wa ni ọjọ ti o dara.
Soon, he will return home.	Laipẹ, o yoo pada si ile.
You should do everything you can to help me.	O yẹ ki o ṣe gbogbo ohun ti o le ṣe lati ran mi lọwọ.
There are many problems with this method.	Awọn iṣoro pupọ wa pẹlu ọna yii.
I'm in love.	Mo ni ife.
It feels like.	O lero bi.
Don't look at me that way.	Maṣe wo mi ni ọna yẹn.
I expect the same from you.	Mo nireti kanna lati ọdọ rẹ.
You will never understand what happened there.	Iwọ kii yoo ti ni oye ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ nibẹ.
You know, they get you to hear about it.	O mọ, wọn gba rẹ lati gbọ nipa rẹ.
It tired me.	O rẹ mi.
I'll come to you in a minute.	Emi yoo wa si ọdọ rẹ ni iṣẹju kan.
I know.	Mo mo.
It is now or not !.	O jẹ bayi tabi rara!.
We didn’t talk much while we waited for them.	A ko sọrọ pupọ nigba ti a duro fun wọn.
Something went wrong with the string.	Nkankan ti ko tọ pẹlu okun.
Urban areas are where people live close to each other.	Awọn agbegbe ilu ni ibi ti awọn eniyan n gbe nitosi ara wọn.
But, of course, no one stopped us.	Ṣugbọn, dajudaju, ko si ẹnikan ti o da wa duro.
He could not read or write and he did not learn.	Ko le ka tabi kọ ati pe ko kọ ẹkọ.
They can read and write.	Wọn le ka ati kọ.
But then it will not be the same anymore.	Ṣugbọn nigba naa kii yoo jẹ kanna mọ.
Here is what I was told.	Eyi ni ohun ti a sọ fun mi.
But you don’t have to do both at the same time.	Ṣugbọn o ko ni lati ṣe mejeeji ni akoko kanna.
This makes it worth it to me.	Eyi jẹ ki o tọ si mi.
You get this.	O gba eyi.
Nothing more than that, for now.	Ko si nkankan ju iyẹn lọ, fun bayi.
Everything went so fast.	Ohun gbogbo lọ ki sare.
He left early this morning not yet arrived.	O kuro ni kutukutu owurọ yi pe ko tii de.
You don’t know anything, it seems.	O ko mọ nkankan, o dabi.
And it is, at first.	Ati pe o jẹ, ni akọkọ.
Two, they are married.	Meji, wọn ti ni iyawo.
I'll give him something to take home with him.	Emi yoo fun u ni nkan lati mu lọ si ile pẹlu rẹ.
Everything you know about cars you build yourself, he said.	Ohun gbogbo ti o mọ nipa awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ti o kọ ara rẹ, o sọ.
Top body strength.	Agbara ara oke.
Is there a bus station nearby?	Ṣe ibudo ọkọ akero kan wa nitosi ibi?
Even bad weather is good.	Paapaa oju ojo buburu dara.
At least not the way it used to be.	O kere kii ṣe ọna ti o ṣe tẹlẹ.
Something similar to the bottom.	Nkankan iru si isalẹ.
At least you can laugh at yourself.	O kere o le rẹrin ara rẹ.
He wants me to go home with him.	O fẹ mi lati lọ si ile pẹlu rẹ.
The benefits of music are many.	Awọn anfani ti orin ni ọpọlọpọ.
There you go, the truth comes out.	Nibẹ ni ibi ti o, otitọ ba jade.
That happens all the time.	Iyẹn ṣẹlẹ nigbagbogbo.
Remember to remember.	Ranti lati ranti.
Just a few.	O kan diẹ.
We are walking fast.	A n rin sare.
I saw his face in front of my eyes.	Mo ri oju rẹ ni iwaju oju mi.
I thought this from bed.	Mo ronu eyi lati ibusun.
They even believe they are.	Paapaa wọn gbagbọ pe wọn jẹ.
They may not get the best advice from their people.	Wọn le ma gba awọn imọran ti o dara julọ lati ọdọ awọn eniyan wọn.
Do not forget your name.	Maṣe gbagbe orukọ rẹ.
That’s all we can do.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo ohun ti a le ṣe.
He has not let such information be available.	Ko ti jẹ ki iru alaye wa.
The world needs it now more than ever.	Aye nilo rẹ ni bayi ju lailai.
I made a song.	Mo ṣe orin kan.
No you don’t have to work out.	Rara o ko ni lati ṣiṣẹ jade.
His books no longer sell.	Awọn iwe rẹ ko ta diẹ sii.
But he is only hurting himself.	Ṣugbọn o n ṣe ararẹ nikan ni ipalara.
However today, we continue to spend money that is not there.	Sibẹsibẹ loni, a tẹsiwaju lati lo owo ti ko si nibẹ.
No big deal, just pick one another out.	Ko si adehun nla, kan gbe ọkan miiran jade.
The man turned and went after a group of women.	Ọkunrin naa yipada o si lọ lẹhin ẹgbẹ kan ti awọn obinrin.
Look for no other.	Wa fun ko si miiran.
I found the right outfit.	Mo rii aṣọ kan ti o tọ.
It takes me all the time.	O gba mi ni gbogbo igba.
I did not know any of this at the time.	Emi ko mọ eyikeyi eyi ni akoko yẹn.
They help each other to their feet.	Wọn ran ara wọn lọwọ si ẹsẹ wọn.
Maybe that’s a mistake in his eyes.	Boya iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe ni oju rẹ.
I am not out with anyone.	Emi ko jade pẹlu ẹnikẹni.
Again, here we go again.	Lẹẹkansi, nibi a tun lọ.
Who all loses.	Tani gbogbo padanu.
To be able to see a moment.	Lati ni anfani lati wo akoko kan.
And it is because of me.	Ati pe nitori mi ni.
When standing, a person's foot is near his head.	Nigbati o ba duro, ẹsẹ eniyan wa nitosi ori rẹ.
People have asked this question many times.	Awọn eniyan ti beere ibeere yii ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
This house has you and more.	Ile yii ni o ati diẹ sii.
In some ways, we are like brothers.	Ni awọn ọna kan, a dabi awọn arakunrin.
I'll stay here for two hours.	Emi yoo wa nibi fun wakati meji.
This is your problem.	Eyi ni iṣoro rẹ.
There he was, he thought.	Nibẹ o tun wa, o ro.
There is nothing to say that he can not.	Ko si nkankan lati sọ pe ko le.
He asked the girl if she wanted more, and he said no.	O beere lọwọ ọmọbirin naa boya o fẹ diẹ, o si sọ rara.
Help, it seems.	Iranlọwọ, dabi.
I hope it happens soon.	Mo nireti pe o ṣẹlẹ laipẹ.
He took that with him.	O mu iyẹn pẹlu rẹ.
And my eyes.	Ati oju mi.
If people reject you, let them.	Ti eniyan ba kọ ọ, jẹ ki wọn.
Let him buy me.	Jẹ ki o ṣe ifẹ si mi.
I love your make up and love how you play games.	Mo ni ife rẹ ṣe soke ati ki o feran bi o ti dun awọn ere.
It doesn’t always matter to them.	Nigbagbogbo ko ṣe pataki si wọn.
Have you been to this place?	Njẹ o ti lọ si ibi yii?
The other one is similar.	Awọn miiran ọkan jẹ iru.
It may be the last life we ​​will have.	O le jẹ aye ikẹhin ti a yoo ni.
This is not possible.	Eyi ko ṣee ṣe.
He took his lessons seriously.	O gba awọn ẹkọ rẹ ni pataki.
I'll tell you when.	Emi yoo sọ fun ọ nigbawo.
School is on time.	Ile-iwe wa ni igba.
He is angry.	O binu.
Drink plenty of water in the summer.	Mu omi pupọ ni igba ooru.
That’s right with us.	Iyẹn tọ pẹlu wa.
It is better not to forget it.	O dara julọ ki a gbagbe rẹ.
Time is everything.	Akoko jẹ ohun gbogbo.
Houses in such areas are usually small.	Awọn ile ni awọn iru agbegbe maa n jẹ kekere.
None of them moved.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o gbe.
See image on top.	Wo aworan lori oke.
This situation, however, may not last long.	Ipo yii, sibẹsibẹ, ko le pẹ.
We traveled.	A rin irin-ajo.
As it turned out, he said no.	Bi o ṣe ri niyẹn, o sọ rara.
Time for bed!	Akoko fun ibusun!
He asked me something.	O beere nkankan fun mi.
But he would not say anything to help me.	Ṣugbọn ko ni sọ ohunkohun lati ran mi lọwọ.
And they have the law on their side.	Ati pe wọn ni ofin ni ẹgbẹ wọn.
There will be many opportunities for them.	Awọn anfani pupọ yoo wa fun wọn.
She looked up from the seat across her.	O wo soke lati ijoko kọja rẹ.
They damaged our car.	Wọ́n ba ọkọ̀ ayọ́kẹ́lẹ́ wa jẹ́.
Wear hands full for moments.	Wọ ọwọ ti o kun fun awọn akoko.
That is the whole world.	Gbogbo aye niyen.
I can't imagine where the problem lies.	Emi ko le ro ero ibi ti iṣoro wa.
Do not go to sleep.	Maṣe lọ sun.
He looked at me for the longest time.	O wo mi fun igba pipẹ julọ.
There is only one boy.	Ọmọkunrin wa nikan.
After he got up, he called for help.	Lẹhin ti o dide, o pe fun iranlọwọ.
You still have it.	O tun ni o.
He doesn't laugh like that anymore.	Ko rẹrin bi iyẹn mọ.
Even.	Paapaa.
It is used enough.	O ti lo to.
She is my best friend.	O jẹ ọrẹ mi pupọ.
Your friend found your car.	Ọrẹ rẹ kan lo wa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ.
The first class is not the first and has three functions in it.	Kilasi akọkọ ko ni akọkọ ati pe o ni awọn iṣẹ mẹta ninu.
It's easy to find, but also easy to make.	O rọrun lati wa, ṣugbọn tun rọrun lati ṣe.
Maybe, a little.	Boya, kekere kan.
Nor should you have.	Tabi o ko yẹ lati ni.
The mother gave birth to a daughter.	Iya naa bi ọmọbirin kan.
You may have searched other sites as well.	O le ti wa awọn aaye miiran pẹlu.
Can you make this song?	Ṣe o le ṣe orin yii?
We see it.	A wo e.
There is no tone about it.	Ko si ohun orin nipa rẹ.
You have forgotten something.	O ti gbagbe nkankan.
There is no room in doing these things personally.	Ko si aaye ni ṣiṣe nkan wọnyi ti ara ẹni.
I do not want to sleep.	Nko fe sun.
And it is very easy to understand.	Ati pe o rọrun julọ lati ni oye.
I made a story.	Mo ṣe itan kan.
I think we will get.	Mo ro pe a yoo gba.
I totally agree with your decision.	Mo gba patapata pẹlu ipinnu rẹ.
Some days are bad.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọjọ jẹ buburu.
Friend.	Ọrẹ.
But he never thought of that.	Ṣugbọn ko ronu eyi rara.
I'm glad you're fine.	Inu mi dun pe o dara julọ.
I didn’t ask much.	Emi ko beere pupọ.
Get some high.	Gba diẹ ninu giga.
That is obvious.	Iyẹn han gbangba.
Even a few women.	Awọn obinrin diẹ paapaa.
They were able to remove some of those.	Wọn ni anfani lati yọ diẹ ninu awọn yẹn.
His company occupies a prominent position in the city.	Ile-iṣẹ rẹ gba ipo pataki ni ilu naa.
You need to talk to him.	O nilo lati ba a sọrọ.
This is not where things are late.	Eyi kii ṣe ibi ti awọn nkan ti pẹ.
What are you doing? ' 	Ki lo de?'
Why, you would take them and they would just hate you.	Kilode, iwọ yoo mu wọn ati pe wọn yoo kan korira rẹ.
I didn’t say much to him.	Emi ko sọ pupọ fun u.
He sold me out.	O ti ta mi jade.
We just have to be on it.	A kan ni lati wa lori rẹ.
You know these people and their lives.	O mọ awọn eniyan wọnyi ati igbesi aye wọn.
Please just go.	Jọwọ nikan lọ.
Remember to drink water regularly.	Ranti lati mu omi nigbagbogbo.
It should be a good day.	O yẹ ki o jẹ ọjọ ti o dara.
I can read that.	Mo le ka iyẹn.
I give everything.	Mo fun ni ohun gbogbo.
You will make mistakes from time to time.	Iwọ yoo ṣe awọn aṣiṣe lati igba de igba.
After a week, no one saw or heard from her.	Lẹhin ọsẹ kan, ko si ẹnikan ti o rii tabi gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
My eyes and ears are no more.	Ko si oju ati eti mi mọ.
What a happy person he is.	Iru eniyan dun wo ni o jẹ.
He's not going to marry her.	O si n ko lilọ lati fẹ rẹ.
I am angry with him.	Mo binu si i.
He will be fine.	Oun yoo dara.
Didn't find anything.	Ko ri nkankan.
We do not know how it happened.	A ko mọ bi o ṣe ṣẹlẹ.
This should work, please try.	Eyi yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ, jọwọ gbiyanju.
He could not raise his hand.	Ko le gbe ọwọ rẹ soke.
I would read a book or see how it works.	Emi yoo ka iwe kan tabi wo bi o ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
They are everywhere.	Wọn ti wa ni gbogbo ibi.
Many are going unnoticed.	Ọpọlọpọ n lọ ti o ko loye.
You are not a person who would like to hurt another person.	Iwọ kii ṣe eniyan ti yoo fẹ lati ṣe ipalara fun eniyan miiran.
That sounds pretty bad.	Ti o dun lẹwa buburu.
But when a man can, he will.	Ṣugbọn nigbati ọkunrin kan le, o yoo.
The test is over.	Idanwo ti pari.
Start, and finish what you started.	Bẹrẹ, ki o si pari ohun ti o bẹrẹ.
It took a long time for such a small person.	O mu fun igba pipẹ fun iru ẹni kekere bẹẹ.
Only some of it is up to you, you know.	Nikan diẹ ninu awọn ti o ni soke si ọ, o mọ.
Can't help.	Ko le ran.
But he did not write about it.	Ṣugbọn ko kọ nipa rẹ.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Ko si ohun ti a le ṣe nipa iyẹn.
Man, it's probably there.	Eniyan, o ṣee ṣe nibẹ.
Give him some small work.	Ṣe fun u diẹ ninu awọn kekere iṣẹ.
He does so much these days.	O ṣe bẹ pupọ ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi.
It does not appear well.	O ko han daradara.
We can wait that long.	A le duro ti o gun.
The past has not changed.	Ohun ti o ti kọja ko yipada.
Your nightgown is painted like paper.	Aṣọ alẹ rẹ ya bi iwe.
I pulled but could not free myself.	Mo fa sugbon ko le laaye ara mi.
Works for me.	Ṣiṣẹ fun mi.
I'm afraid this is it.	Mo bẹru pe eyi ni.
No one thought it was possible.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ro pe o ṣee ṣe.
She began to laugh.	O bẹrẹ si rẹrin.
And he has done so.	Ati pe o ti ṣe bẹ.
I loved it when a man left his seat.	Mo fẹran rẹ nigbati ọkunrin kan fi ijoko rẹ silẹ.
I am sure you will know what to do.	Mo ni idaniloju pe iwọ yoo mọ kini lati ṣe.
As he turned to lock the door, our eyes met.	Bi o ti yipada lati ti ilẹkun, oju wa pade.
We should be on our way soon.	A yẹ ki o wa ni ọna wa laipẹ.
Your approach is simple.	Ọna rẹ rọrun.
First, we are getting better.	Ni akọkọ, a ti n dara si.
My children taught it well.	Awọn ọmọ mi kọ ọ daradara.
I will read a lot.	Emi yoo ka pupọ.
It came up over and over again.	O wa soke lori ati lori lẹẹkansi.
Well nothing else.	Daradara ko si ohun miiran.
I will continue to hear if they have more information.	Mo tẹsiwaju lati gbọ ti wọn ba ni alaye diẹ sii.
It will not take long.	Ko ni gba to gun.
We accept it not.	A gba o ko.
There are also other people around you.	Awọn eniyan miiran tun wa ni ayika rẹ.
It did not work as expected.	Ko ṣiṣẹ bi o ti ṣe yẹ.
But here, no.	Ṣugbọn nibi, ko si.
It has been so good!	O ti dara pupọ!
We forgot to do so.	A gbagbe lati ṣe bẹ.
They are not like me.	Wọn ko dabi emi.
You have to give them a little more to get rid of them.	O ni lati fun wọn diẹ diẹ lati yọ wọn kuro.
Or a few days ago, if you will.	Tabi awọn ọjọ diẹ sẹhin, ti o ba fẹ.
It is often done.	O ti wa ni igba ṣe.
He thought it, too.	O si ro o, ju.
Let me explain what we mean by these words.	Jẹ ki n ṣe alaye ohun ti a tumọ nipasẹ awọn ọrọ wọnyi.
These two conditions are the same.	Awọn ipo meji wọnyi jẹ kanna.
I really hope to be back there one day.	Mo nireti gaan lati pada wa nibẹ ni ọjọ kan.
That obviously will not happen.	Iyẹn han gbangba pe kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Okay, man.	O dara, eniyan.
I don't want to see anyone.	Emi ko fẹ lati ri ẹnikẹni.
It will be a celebration of the season.	Yoo jẹ ayẹyẹ ti akoko naa.
But it can't help it.	Sugbon ko le ran o.
We have to understand.	A ni lati ni oye.
You should have taken a picture.	O yẹ ki o ti ya aworan kan.
We are in the works.	A wa ni awọn iṣẹ naa.
They need to go, especially.	Wọn nilo lati lọ, paapaa.
Maybe they even know.	Boya wọn ti mọ paapaa.
For the next few minutes.	Fun awọn iṣẹju diẹ to nbọ.
He looked both ways, but did not see much.	O wo awọn ọna mejeeji, ṣugbọn ko ri pupọ.
I would like to know what is happening.	Emi yoo fẹ lati mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
When he got there, he died.	Ti o ba de ibi, o ku.
I missed some, but not much.	Mo padanu diẹ ninu, ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ.
We want to have a good time.	A fẹ lati ni kan ti o dara akoko.
The body he has is probably still there.	Awọn ara ti o ni jẹ jasi si tun wa.
Some women like to work at home.	Diẹ ninu awọn obinrin fẹ lati ṣiṣẹ ninu ile.
They will not believe they are wrong.	Wọn kii yoo gbagbọ pe wọn jẹ aṣiṣe.
Do not keep your eyes off the road.	Maṣe gbe oju rẹ kuro ni opopona.
She loves to be with you.	O nifẹ lati wa pẹlu rẹ.
I sat down to wait.	Mo joko lati duro.
I have others who just want information on what’s going on.	Mo ni awọn miiran ti o kan fẹ alaye lori ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
I love rain.	Mo nifẹ ojo.
I am a mother.	Mo jẹ iya.
You have to live with that.	O ni lati gbe pẹlu iyẹn.
Let me talk to him.	Jẹ ki n ba a sọrọ.
I'll send this to him.	Emi yoo fi nkan yii ranṣẹ si i.
They paid me for this.	Wọn san mi fun eyi.
This is usually found near the beach.	Eyi ni a maa n rii nitosi eti okun.
You will see it is not a car.	Iwọ yoo wo rẹ kii ṣe ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
I would like to know why.	Emi yoo fẹ lati mọ idi.
Will do it again.	Yoo ṣe lẹẹkansi.
Many other people do not believe these things.	Pupọ awọn eniyan miiran ko gbagbọ nkan wọnyi.
We are also learning.	A tun n kọ ẹkọ.
They tied their hands together.	Wọ́n di ọwọ́ wọn mọ́.
However, he never left my side.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko kuro ni ẹgbẹ mi rara.
All this right, as he decided to stay here.	Gbogbo eyi tọ, bi o ti pinnu lati duro si ibi.
But he looks great, his stuff looks great.	Ṣugbọn o dabi ẹni nla, nkan rẹ dabi nla.
I know what you feel.	Mo mọ ohun ti o lero.
By that you can be very confident.	Nipa iyẹn o le ni idaniloju pupọ.
And it was good for me.	Ati pe o dara fun mi.
I have had a long day.	Mo ti ni ọjọ pipẹ.
A new approach to local times.	Ọna tuntun si awọn akoko agbegbe.
The book is, of course, but more available.	Iwe naa ni, dajudaju, ṣugbọn diẹ sii wa.
Do not forget to turn off the street lights.	Maṣe gbagbe lati pa awọn ina ita.
This is incredibly important.	Eleyi jẹ iyalẹnu pataki.
Not just, man.	Ko kan, eniyan.
This is a great word for you.	Eyi jẹ ọrọ nla fun ọ.
He refuses to let her go.	O kọ lati jẹ ki o lọ.
At first they just wanted to.	Ni akọkọ wọn kan fẹ.
Maybe you should.	Boya o yẹ ki o ni.
Life is not right, '' he said.	Igbesi aye ko tọ, '' o sọ.
Do not drop any food.	Maṣe sọ ounjẹ eyikeyi silẹ.
You will leave.	Iwọ yoo lọ kuro.
You should just ask him.	O yẹ ki o kan beere lọwọ rẹ.
It has been completely with his life.	O ti jẹ patapata pẹlu igbesi aye rẹ.
People will say they will give you anything, but they do not.	Awọn eniyan yoo sọ pe wọn yoo fun ọ ni ohunkohun, ṣugbọn wọn ko ṣe.
But please, do not change me.	Ṣugbọn jọwọ, maṣe yi mi pada.
Not again.	Ko lẹẹkansi.
Such a thing happened.	Iru ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
The man got up to greet me.	Ọkunrin naa dide lati ki mi.
We bought our meals at a supermarket.	A ra awọn ounjẹ wa ni ile itaja nla kan.
They are female.	Wọn jẹ obinrin.
We know more now than we already know.	A mọ diẹ sii ni bayi ju ti a ti mọ tẹlẹ.
We will promise you.	A yoo ṣe ileri fun ọ.
He hit something hard.	O lu nkankan lile.
At least, that’s my understanding.	O kere ju, oye mi niyẹn.
You will see that they want to do it.	Iwọ yoo rii pe wọn fẹ lati ṣe.
I know it's not good.	Mo mọ pe ko dara.
He could not explain it.	Ko le ṣe alaye rẹ.
That is what they eat.	Ohun ti won je niyen.
I think everyone needs to find out for themselves.	Mo ro pe gbogbo eniyan nilo lati wa jade fun ara wọn.
They all made their way to him.	Gbogbo wọn ṣe ọna fun u.
They never heard such a thing.	Wọn ko gbọ iru nkan bẹẹ.
That's the kind of person he is.	Iru eniyan ti o jẹ niyẹn.
And watch the fun begin.	Ati ki o wo awọn fun bẹrẹ.
Kind of can kill you, but once you’ve cured it’s gone.	Iru ti o le pa ọ, ṣugbọn ni kete ti o ti tọju o ti lọ.
Man cannot live.	Eniyan ko le gbe.
It's in the bag.	O ni ninu apo.
He told himself that this was to be the last trip.	O sọ fun ara rẹ pe eyi ni lati jẹ irin-ajo ikẹhin.
In the end, education is key.	Ni ipari, ẹkọ jẹ bọtini.
It’s about a lot more area.	O jẹ nipa agbegbe pupọ diẹ sii.
Please let me paint.	Jọwọ jẹ ki mi kun.
I totally agree.	Mo gba patapata.
I do not have that.	Emi ko ni iyẹn.
And that is also a mistake.	Ati pe iyẹn tun jẹ aṣiṣe.
And, there is a lot of truth in that.	Ati pe, ọpọlọpọ otitọ wa ninu iyẹn.
No one said anything.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ohunkohun.
This team has dropped the ball.	Ẹgbẹ yii ti lọ silẹ bọọlu.
And they will do whatever you want.	Ati pe wọn yoo ṣe ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
That’s very simple already.	Iyẹn rọrun pupọ tẹlẹ.
In your house but not in your bed.	Ninu ile rẹ ṣugbọn kii ṣe ni ibusun rẹ.
He pulls it out, inside out.	O fa kuro, inu jade.
They got me in the wrong place.	Wọn ni mi ni aaye ti ko dara.
If they are stolen, they cannot be recovered.	Ti wọn ba ji, a ko le gba wọn pada.
This has been great.	Eyi ti jẹ nla.
That is my problem.	Wahala mi niyen.
I just love that game.	Mo kan nifẹ si ere yẹn.
And this is it.	O si ni yii.
It looks beautiful.	O wo lẹwa.
None of this is more.	Ko si eyi jẹ diẹ sii.
He stopped to think.	O duro lati ronu.
He looks down from above.	O n wo isalẹ lati oke.
I'm glad that.	Inu mi dun pe.
Or a time in our lives.	Tabi akoko kan ninu aye wa.
Neither of them moved.	Bẹni ninu wọn ko gbe.
We have time.	A ni akoko.
It’s something we don’t often take the time to think about.	O jẹ ohun ti a ko igba gba akoko lati ro.
We took a field trip.	A rin irin-ajo aaye kan.
In other words, what it is.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, ohun ti o jẹ.
It was the most amazing thing to think about.	O jẹ ohun iyanu julọ lati ronu nipa.
I'm not good at it.	Emi ko dara ni rẹ.
How can it be done.	Bawo ni o ṣe le ṣee ṣe.
In all our pictures we have that.	Ninu gbogbo awọn aworan wa a ni iyẹn.
I thought outside the box.	Mo ro ita apoti.
However, this function does not work.	Sibẹsibẹ, iṣẹ yii ko ṣiṣẹ.
In a way, it is a good idea.	Ni ọna kan, o jẹ imọran ti o dara.
The aim is to make sure every child has books.	Ero ni lati rii daju pe gbogbo ọmọ ni awọn iwe.
I don’t have time to explain right now.	Emi ko ni akoko lati ṣe alaye ni bayi.
But it didn’t take them long to think again.	Ṣugbọn ko gba wọn gun lati ronu lẹẹkansi.
He got up from his seat.	O dide kuro ni ijoko.
They seem to be okay with it.	Wọn dabi ẹni pe o dara pẹlu rẹ.
It took me a bad time.	O gba mi ni akoko buburu.
However, when this will happen it will not be obvious.	Sibẹsibẹ, nigbati eyi yoo ṣẹlẹ kii yoo han gbangba.
I want to make you feel good.	Mo fẹ lati jẹ ki inu rẹ dara.
Which was usually everyone.	Eyi ti o wà maa gbogbo eniyan.
I want to hear what people think.	Mo fẹ lati gbọ ohun ti eniyan ro.
I'll go back to bed.	Emi yoo pada si ibusun.
More power for them.	Agbara diẹ sii fun wọn.
Maybe your body can’t stand it.	Boya ara rẹ ko le duro.
I don’t have to do this.	Emi ko ni lati ṣe eyi.
Don't hurt him again.	Maṣe ṣe ipalara fun u lẹẹkansi.
You feel you can help your team.	O lero pe o le ṣe iranlọwọ fun ẹgbẹ rẹ.
People know who he is.	Eniyan mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
The truth is that you can, but do not want to.	Otitọ ni pe o le, ṣugbọn ko fẹ.
I have changed a lot.	Mo ti yipada pupọ.
We were told there was nothing to fear.	A sọ fun wa pe ko si nkankan lati bẹru.
This is another thing that happened two years ago.	Eyi jẹ ohun miiran ti o ṣẹlẹ ni ọdun meji sẹhin.
This is how you tell people you are on their side.	Eyi ni bi o ṣe sọ fun eniyan pe o wa ni ẹgbẹ wọn.
Now he wonders why he thinks he can.	Bayi o ṣe iyalẹnu idi ti o fi ro pe oun le.
Not even visible.	Ko paapaa han.
He could not do anything bad.	Ko le ṣe ohunkohun buburu.
The plane climbed up.	Ọkọ ofurufu naa ga soke si oke.
But here, by this time, it has grown.	Ṣugbọn nibi, ni akoko yii, o ti dagba.
I'll see you there.	Emi yoo ri ọ nibẹ.
People here say.	Eniyan nibi sọ.
We always do this.	A nigbagbogbo ṣe eyi.
You are not such a woman.	Iwọ kii ṣe iru obinrin bẹẹ.
I read the books you read.	Mo ka awọn iwe ti o ka.
She had the last thought everyone had for their mother.	O ni ero ikẹhin ti gbogbo eniyan ni fun iya wọn.
I can't be too good to let it go right now.	Emi ko le dara pupọ jẹ ki o lọ ni bayi.
They know you by the sun itself.	Wọn mọ ọ nipasẹ oorun ara rẹ.
Read on for personal advice from you.	Ka lori imọran ti ara ẹni lati ọdọ rẹ.
I was old enough to be your father.	Mo ti dagba to lati jẹ baba rẹ.
By water.	Nipasẹ omi.
It takes more than a year to do.	O gba diẹ sii ju ọdun kan lati ṣe.
If they don’t, that’s fine.	Ti wọn ko ba ṣe bẹ, o dara.
We believe what we see is true.	A gbagbọ ohun ti a ri ni otitọ.
Let's go out into the garden.	Jẹ ki a jade lọ sinu ọgba.
Not for any special powers.	Ko fun eyikeyi awọn agbara pataki.
You never tried.	O ko gbiyanju rara.
No work.	Ko si ise.
Write every day.	Kọ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Can live at times.	Le o gbe ni awon akoko.
That was three days ago.	Iyẹn jẹ ọjọ mẹta sẹhin.
Once he started, he realized he couldn’t stop.	Ni kete ti o bẹrẹ, o rii pe ko le duro.
But it is not so.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ.
It's amazing.	Ohun iyanu ni.
But he did not die.	Sugbon ko ku.
In fact, you do not really understand women.	Ni otitọ, iwọ ko loye awọn obinrin gaan.
Just go take care of it.	Kan lọ tọju rẹ.
I would not say that off.	Emi kii yoo sọ pe pa.
However, it does do some work, so take care of it.	Sibẹsibẹ, o ṣe diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ, nitorina tọju rẹ.
Nothing to do with anything.	Ko si ohun ti o ṣe ohun kan.
Just do not.	O kan maṣe ṣe.
For me it was hard.	Fun mi o jẹ lile.
I was trying to understand it, but it made it very difficult.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ni oye rẹ, ṣugbọn o jẹ ki o nira pupọ.
I have not received anything yet.	Emi ko ti gba nkankan sibẹsibẹ.
Some students have passed the test during this time.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ti gba idanwo ni akoko yii.
And in fact, they do not want to give up their power.	Ati ni otitọ, wọn ko fẹ lati fi agbara wọn silẹ.
I would like to see what people do with this.	Emi yoo fẹ lati wo kini eniyan ṣe pẹlu eyi.
That is what he told us.	Ohun ti o sọ fun wa niyẹn.
I am happy, a mother like her.	Inu mi dun si, iya kan bi rẹ.
I think more of the future.	Mo ro diẹ ti ojo iwaju.
The man said nothing.	Ọkunrin naa ko sọ nkankan.
Such games look and sound great.	Iru iru awọn ere wo ati dun dara julọ.
It will be something else.	Yoo di nkan miiran.
I was wrong.	Mo ti ṣe aṣiṣe.
It took you for pretty long.	O si mu o fun lẹwa gun ju.
You can see the power.	O le rii agbara naa.
Of these, you must allow me.	Ninu awọn wọnyi, o gbọdọ fi aaye fun mi.
I enjoyed it.	Mo gbadun re.
I think you missed the point.	Mo ro pe o padanu aaye naa.
He seemed to hear.	O dabi enipe o gbọ.
But your time is up ?.	Sugbon akoko re ti pari?.
Not in a good or bad way.	Kii ṣe ni ọna ti o dara tabi buburu.
However, we can do more.	Sibẹsibẹ, a le ṣe diẹ sii.
Not as good as you think.	Ko dara bi o ṣe ro.
It came to me physically.	O wa si mi nipa ti ara.
Over a period of at least one year.	Lori akoko ti o kere ju ọdun kan.
And nothing will go.	Ati pe ko si nkan ti yoo lọ.
You should be with your mother.	O yẹ ki o wa pẹlu iya rẹ.
I find it is too late.	Mo rii pe o ti pẹ ju.
Just get out of here.	O kan jade kuro ni ibi.
They just help me pull myself together.	Wọn kan ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi lati fa ara mi papọ.
He remembers the lost house.	O ranti ile ti o padanu.
Not you either.	Kii ṣe iwọ paapaa.
It could have been better.	O le ti dara julọ.
Wedding plans are not stressful.	Awọn eto igbeyawo ko ni wahala.
And you will be happy to stay in place.	Ati pe inu rẹ yoo dun lati duro ni ibi.
Now it works from the inside out.	Bayi o ṣiṣẹ lati inu jade.
We have no money.	A ko ni owo.
This is what you will need to do yourself.	Eyi ni iwọ yoo nilo lati ṣe funrararẹ.
He’s coming back to the party with me.	O n pada wa si ẹgbẹ pẹlu mi.
I can't pull back now.	Nko le fa pada bayi.
Let me drive it.	Jẹ ki n wakọ rẹ.
That doesn't make any sense.	Iyẹn ko ṣe ori eyikeyi.
And it eats you from the inside.	O si n jẹ ọ lati inu.
We run as fast as we can.	A sare bi a ti le.
There are no highways.	Ko si awọn ọna opopona.
It could be your side.	O le jẹ ẹgbẹ rẹ.
Take life, man.	Gba aye, eniyan.
One thing is for sure.	Ohun kan daju.
It takes your time.	O gba akoko rẹ.
There really was nothing to see.	Nibẹ gan je ko nkankan lati ri.
We will get married tomorrow if you want.	A yoo ṣe igbeyawo ni ọla ti o ba fẹ.
And when you do, it will be easier to work with.	Ati pe nigba ti o ba ṣe bẹ, ṣiṣẹ yoo rọrun.
You can see more of your work.	O le rii diẹ sii ti iṣẹ rẹ ni.
He did not give up.	Ko fun soke.
He learned to be a doctor.	O kọ ẹkọ lati jẹ dokita.
Most people read your book.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ka iwe rẹ.
We did not do much work yesterday.	A ko ṣe ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ ni ana.
All eyes were on her.	Gbogbo oju si wa lori rẹ.
Whatever you want will be done.	Ohunkohun ti o ba fẹ yoo ṣee ṣe.
It will end in an hour, maybe less.	Yoo pari ni wakati kan, boya kere si.
He stopped and looked.	O duro ati ki o wo.
We must celebrate the life of a dead person.	A gbọdọ ṣe ayẹyẹ igbesi aye eniyan ti o ku.
There are many interesting historical sites in this area.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn aaye itan ti o nifẹ si wa ni agbegbe yii.
Not long enough.	Ko pẹ to.
That is a good reason to hear what you have to say.	Ti o ni idi ti o dara lati gbọ ohun ti o ni lati sọ.
And more than you.	Ati ju iwọ lọ.
No one was spared for this.	A ko ya ẹnikẹni silẹ rara fun eyi.
There is nothing to say about them.	Ko si nkankan lati sọ nipa wọn.
Pictures are the first thing you will notice here.	Awọn aworan ni akọkọ ohun ti o yoo se akiyesi nibi.
I have played great.	Mo ti dun nla.
The room was big and very clean.	Awọn yara je nla ati ki o gidigidi o mọ.
You don’t talk about this song as much as you do.	O ko sọrọ nipa orin yii bi o ti ṣe.
You can not, no.	O ko le, ko si.
I can not decide whether to bathe or not to bathe.	Emi ko le pinnu boya lati wẹ tabi kii ṣe lati wẹ.
I'm not taking advantage of either.	Mo n ko ya awọn anfani ti boya.
He could not ask for more donations.	Ko le beere fun ẹbun diẹ sii.
I do not like.	Nko feran.
Everyone looked at me to make a decision.	Gbogbo eniyan wo mi lati ṣe ipinnu.
It’s easy on students.	O rọrun lori awọn ọmọ ile-iwe.
Don't tell me.	Maṣe sọ fun mi.
Only facts.	Awọn otitọ nikan.
I met him at his house.	Mo pade rẹ ni ile rẹ.
She’s doing her job and she’s doing well.	O n ṣe iṣẹ rẹ ati pe o ṣe daradara.
The ball itself is also constantly changing.	Bọọlu funrararẹ tun yipada nigbagbogbo.
It seems that your application does not tell this truth.	O dabi pe ohun elo rẹ ko sọ otitọ yii.
It helps me clear my thoughts.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi lati mu awọn ero mi kuro.
That made me feel really good.	Iyẹn jẹ ki ara mi dara pupọ.
Nothing else down here right now.	Ko si ohun miiran ni isalẹ nibi bayi.
Just not enough.	O kan ko to.
The time has come.	Akoko naa ti pada.
Sometimes it is very small.	Nigba miiran o kere pupọ.
I did it on my own.	Mo ti ṣe o lori ara mi.
It was his only lunch.	O jẹ ounjẹ ọsan rẹ nikan.
You feel better, better than you have in a while.	O ro pe o dara, o dara ju ti o ni ni igba diẹ.
I should not let that happen.	Emi ko yẹ ki o jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
You just need to let your desires know.	O nilo nikan jẹ ki awọn ifẹ rẹ mọ.
You get your wishes.	O gba awọn ifẹ rẹ.
Don't miss the moment.	Maṣe padanu akoko.
If not beaten.	Ti o ba jẹ pe ko ti lu.
For yourself, it does not feel or purpose.	Fun ara rẹ, ko ni rilara tabi idi.
They do not have to decide.	Wọn ko ni lati pinnu.
I made a big mistake.	Mo ti ṣe aṣiṣe nla kan.
No up, no down.	Ko si oke, ko si isalẹ.
Start talking to them.	Bẹrẹ sọrọ si wọn.
I can touch it.	Mo ti le fi ọwọ kan o.
I will never be able to find a job.	Emi kii yoo ni anfani lati wa iṣẹ kan.
It made sense to him.	O ṣe oye fun u.
You read from the book you entered.	O ka lati iwe ti o wọ.
My family and friends.	Ebi mi ati awọn ọrẹ.
Maybe they can do a better job than we do.	Boya wọn le ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara ju wa lọ.
Just a matter of time.	O kan ọrọ kan ti akoko.
Okay, maybe the day after, but that day is sure.	O dara, boya ni ọjọ lẹhin, ṣugbọn ọjọ yẹn ni idaniloju.
Accept whatever he tells you.	Gba ohunkohun ti o ba sọ fun ọ.
In a convincing case.	Ninu ohun kan ti o ni idaniloju.
And a lot less sweet.	Ati ki o kan Pupo kere dun.
What a great world!	Iru aye nla wo ni!
It does not work at this time.	Ko ṣiṣẹ ni akoko yii.
Where is this?	Ibi wo ni eyi?
They did not say so.	Wọn ko sọ bẹ bẹ.
I'm sure you've heard that story.	O da mi loju pe o ti gbọ itan yẹn.
This is how we should expect.	Eyi jẹ bi o ti yẹ ki a reti.
I want you to leave here.	Mo fe e kuro nibi.
But he knew the problem, at least.	Ṣugbọn o mọ iṣoro naa, o kere ju.
I have a feeling that your skills can speed things up.	Mo ni rilara pe awọn ọgbọn rẹ le yara ohun soke.
I really want to.	Mo ti fẹ gaan.
I miss you, too.	Mo padanu rẹ, paapaa.
He is clean.	O ti wẹ.
I don’t know why, it just is.	Ko mọ idi, o kan jẹ.
Newlyweds drive home.	Awọn iyawo tuntun wakọ ile.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ko si ohun ti o jẹ aṣiṣe pẹlu iyẹn.
You will not find a place called anything more there.	Iwọ kii yoo rii aaye kan ti a pe ni ohunkohun diẹ nibẹ.
Come on in.	Wa sinu.
I don't want you to wait.	Emi ko fẹ ki o duro.
I am writing up to this.	Mo n kọ soke si eyi.
There are times when you have to wait for what you believe.	Awọn akoko wa ti o ni lati duro fun ohun ti o gbagbọ.
Money is not an issue.	Owo kii ṣe ọrọ.
They always have a life outside of work.	Wọn nigbagbogbo ni igbesi aye ita iṣẹ.
This is especially true for women.	Eyi jẹ otitọ paapaa fun awọn obinrin.
You get who you are, mistakes and all.	O gba ẹni ti o jẹ, awọn aṣiṣe ati gbogbo.
Let me know if you need any more.	Jẹ ki mi mọ ti o ba nilo eyikeyi diẹ sii.
That makes me hot.	Iyẹn mu mi gbona.
Why not money ?.	Idi ti ko owo ni ?.
That will not happen here.	Iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ nibi.
He has no thoughts or desires of his own.	Ko ni ero tabi ifẹ ti ara rẹ.
It's too late.	A ti pẹ ju.
I had no idea there was such a thing.	Emi ko mọ pe iru nkan bẹẹ wa.
You never know when your last time will come.	Iwọ ko mọ igba akoko ikẹhin rẹ yoo de.
I have to, to keep it.	Mo ni lati, lati pa a mọ.
But you need someone to let you do it.	Ṣugbọn o nilo ẹnikan lati jẹ ki o ṣe.
Let's put one here.	Jẹ ká fi ọkan nibi.
There is no time or place for true love.	Ko si akoko tabi aaye kan fun ifẹ otitọ.
People leave that to themselves.	Awọn eniyan fi iyẹn silẹ fun ara wọn.
We will have to deal with two.	A yoo ni lati ṣe pẹlu meji.
He grabbed a ball with one hand.	O mu bọọlu kan pẹlu ọwọ kan.
And my older brother is married.	Ati arakunrin mi nla ti ni iyawo.
I have.	Mo ti ni.
They had spent the previous two weeks at the site.	Wọn ti lo ọsẹ meji ti tẹlẹ ni aaye naa.
I wondered if he had moved.	Mo ro boya o ti gbe.
See this.	Wo eleyi.
But we should not go now.	Ṣugbọn a ko yẹ ki o lọ ni bayi.
Maybe it's right.	Boya o tọ.
We will not listen.	A ko ni gbọ.
Not forever.	Ko lailai lailai.
It just would not have happened.	O kan kii ba ti ṣẹlẹ.
Maybe he'll be back with you now.	Boya oun yoo pada pẹlu rẹ ni bayi.
He will do many things today.	Oun yoo ṣe ọpọlọpọ nkan loni.
I hope he doesn't get upset.	Mo nireti pe ko bi i ninu.
We'll see if they work.	A yoo rii boya wọn ṣiṣẹ.
I have a nice music box.	Mo ni apoti ohun elo orin kan daradara.
And eat with other people.	Ati jẹun pẹlu awọn eniyan miiran.
Or kill you.	Tabi pa ọ.
At least that’s what it should be about.	O kere ju iyẹn ni ohun ti o yẹ lati jẹ nipa.
The problem with books is that people will read them.	Iṣoro pẹlu awọn iwe ni pe eniyan yoo ka wọn.
I think he asked not to call him anymore at work.	Mo ro pe o beere pe ki o ma pe oun mọ ni ibi iṣẹ.
They will just have to keep for another day.	Wọn yoo kan ni lati tọju fun ọjọ miiran.
She has a beautiful face.	O ni oju ti o dara.
How would you do the same ?.	Bawo ni iwọ yoo ṣe ṣe kanna?.
Recently, one in three team members had no job.	Laipẹ, ọkan ninu awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ ẹgbẹ mẹta ko ni iṣẹ kan.
One is true advice.	Ọkan jẹ imọran otitọ.
And let it go.	Ki o si jẹ ki o lọ.
Now, about that day.	Bayi, nipa ọjọ yẹn.
I do not see any reason to leave yet.	Emi ko rii idi kan lati fi silẹ sibẹsibẹ.
It should be.	O yẹ ki o wa.
Sometimes you are, and sometimes you are not.	Nigba miiran o wa, ati nigba miiran iwọ kii ṣe.
Get out of this world.	Jade kuro ninu aye yi.
My sister-in-law and her husband regularly visit.	Arabinrin ọkọ mi ati ọkọ rẹ nigbagbogbo ṣabẹwo.
No one was allowed in those buildings.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o gba laaye ninu awọn ile yẹn.
Or the remaining conditions, for that matter.	Tabi awọn ipo ti o ku, fun ọrọ naa.
Of course you know that is not true.	Dajudaju o mọ pe kii ṣe otitọ.
So this is a mistake.	Nitorina eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
Something man has done.	Nkankan ti eniyan ṣe.
They both know how much it costs.	Awọn mejeeji mọ iye ti o ṣe.
At least your words are full here.	O kere ju ọrọ rẹ kun nibi.
But those.	Sugbon awon.
Keep them during the day.	Pa wọn mọ nigba ọjọ.
You could have done more.	O le ti ṣe diẹ sii.
There is no reason to say food is.	Ko ṣe idi kan lati sọ ounjẹ jẹ.
I tested on my device.	Mo ṣe idanwo lori ẹrọ mi.
You may not agree to it.	O le ko gba si o.
I passed it.	Mo ti kọja rẹ.
You never know what else to do.	O ko mọ kini ohun miiran lati ṣe.
Maybe there is little value in doing anything.	Boya iye diẹ wa ni ṣiṣe ohunkohun.
Everyone else is very worried about their own thing.	Gbogbo eniyan miiran ni aniyan pupọ nipa nkan ti ara wọn.
Just get a master’s degree.	O kan gba oye oye oye.
Your site is not required.	A ko nilo aaye rẹ.
They will need them next year.	Wọn yoo nilo wọn ni ọdun to nbọ.
He spent most of the week in bed, he said.	O lo pupọ julọ ọsẹ ni ibusun, o sọ.
I just drop into something here.	Mo kan ju sinu nkankan nibi.
But it does not matter what you say.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe pataki ohun ti o ti ẹnu rẹ jade.
These are great people.	Eniyan nla ni wọnyi.
Big questions are asked !.	Awọn ibeere nla ni a beere!.
No letter for more than two weeks.	Ko si lẹta kan ju ọsẹ meji lọ.
I tried to look past.	Mo gbiyanju lati wo ti o ti kọja.
He is not such a person.	Oun kii ṣe iru eniyan bẹẹ.
They just eat the stuff.	Wọn kan jẹ nkan naa.
Which one does not like.	Eyi ti ẹnikan ko fẹran.
He expects more.	O nireti diẹ sii.
So he was killed last night.	Nitorina a pa a ni alẹ ana.
But there are times.	Ṣugbọn awọn akoko wa.
It wasn’t long before we arrived as the celebration began.	Ko pẹ diẹ ti a ti de bi ayẹyẹ naa bẹrẹ.
That may come as a surprise to some people.	Iyẹn le jẹ iyalẹnu fun diẹ ninu awọn eniyan.
The most important thing.	Ohun ti o ṣe pataki julọ.
A little word to me.	Ọrọ kekere si mi.
Say you know him and you will help him.	Sọ pe o mọ ọ ati pe iwọ yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
Not like brother and sister.	Ko bi arakunrin ati arabinrin.
He did not know what to do.	Ko mọ ohun ti wọn yẹ ki o ṣe.
I just stopped.	Mo kan duro.
You know what you want.	O mọ ohun ti o fẹ.
I would really love to hear from you.	Emi yoo gbadun gaan lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
I would do well to live with.	Emi yoo dara lati gbe pẹlu.
But it can be very difficult for me.	Ṣugbọn o le pupọ fun mi.
Nothing came out of his mouth.	Ko si ohun ti o ti ẹnu rẹ jade.
I want that.	Mo fe pe.
Or at least, it should be.	Tabi o kere ju, o yẹ ki o jẹ.
And many other places.	Ati ọpọlọpọ awọn aaye miiran.
Let’s keep it simple.	Jẹ ki a jẹ ki o rọrun.
Okay, just start.	O dara, kan bẹrẹ.
Deciding when to go is not easy.	Ṣiṣe ipinnu igba lati lọ kii ṣe rọrun.
But they know that.	Ṣugbọn wọn mọ iyẹn.
That is what you need.	Ohun ti o nilo niyen.
This is why you get the error.	Eyi ni idi ti o fi gba aṣiṣe.
They will not see.	Wọn kii yoo ri.
Just a few more minutes.	O kan iṣẹju diẹ diẹ sii.
There are a few facts.	Awọn otitọ diẹ wa.
In the end, he built a school for the children.	Ni ipari, o kọ ile-iwe kan fun awọn ọmọde.
When you are a student you always have a lot of teachers.	Nigbati o ba jẹ ọmọ ile-iwe o nigbagbogbo ni ọpọlọpọ awọn olukọ.
There are a lot of people there.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan lo wa nibẹ.
I look at my mother.	Mo wo iya mi.
We want to sell it and take money with us.	A fẹ lati ta o ati ki o ya owo pẹlu wa.
Now, my tea.	Bayi, tii mi.
I would hate to miss it.	Emi yoo korira lati padanu rẹ.
Will take the word even I believe in that way.	Yoo gba ọrọ naa paapaa Mo gbagbọ ni ọna yẹn.
But he was a good dog.	Sugbon o je kan ti o dara aja.
Only if you treat them.	Nikan ti o ba tọju wọn.
So we decided not to at this time.	Nitorina a pinnu lati ma ṣe ni akoko yii.
It should be very easy to reach.	O yẹ ki o rọrun pupọ lati de ọdọ.
There are three people in the room.	Eniyan mẹta wa ninu yara naa.
You know how it is.	O mọ bi o ṣe jẹ.
It would have been more important.	Yoo ti jẹ pataki diẹ sii.
Or maybe any of them do.	Tabi boya eyikeyi ninu wọn ṣe.
He did what everyone was afraid to do.	O ṣe ohun ti gbogbo eniyan bẹru lati ṣe.
I really enjoyed this.	Mo gbadun eyi gaan.
People who listen will also.	Awọn eniyan ti o gbọ yoo tun.
The cat was in bed, asleep.	Ologbo naa wa lori ibusun, sun oorun.
Where will it go now.	Nibo ni yoo lọ bayi.
His eyes widened from his eyes.	Oju rẹ ya kuro ni oju rẹ.
How simple some were.	Bawo ni o rọrun ti diẹ ninu awọn wà.
This you can do.	Eyi o le ṣe.
He called himself.	O pe ara rẹ ni.
I did not write the letters.	Emi ko awọn lẹta naa.
You will make me happy, and make everything possible.	Iwọ yoo jẹ ki inu mi dun, ki o jẹ ki ohun gbogbo ṣee ṣe.
Come, please.	Jọwọ, wa.
Work means work.	Iṣẹ tumọ si iṣẹ.
You just have to do your best in it.	O kan ni lati ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ ninu rẹ.
Make a little love.	Ṣe ifẹ kekere kan.
It tastes so good and good.	O dun pupọ o si dara.
We swim in the ocean.	A we ni okun oju.
You don’t have to do everything yourself.	O ko ni lati ṣe ohun gbogbo funrararẹ.
Of course nothing happened.	Dajudaju ko si nkan ti o ṣẹlẹ.
I have no idea what is going on.	Emi ko ni imọran ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
He walks up and picks them up.	O rin soke ki o si mu wọn.
Often they cannot make decisions for themselves, they need help.	Nigbagbogbo wọn ko le ṣe awọn ipinnu fun ara wọn, wọn nilo iranlọwọ.
None of us know what happened to them.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa ti o mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si wọn.
Obviously way too long.	O han ni ọna gun ju.
No, that's not all, he decided.	Rara, iyẹn kii ṣe iyẹn patapata, o pinnu.
Nothing more to say.	Ko si ohun miiran lati sọ.
Turn off the world and do something for me.	Pa aye kuro ki o ṣe nkan kan fun mi.
I think you know that, especially.	Mo ro pe o mọ pe, paapaa.
Save me and my mother for a little money.	Gba mi ati iya mi ni owo kekere kan.
The life they live together seems beautiful to him.	Igbesi aye ti wọn gbe papọ dabi ẹni pe o lẹwa fun u.
Not much work remains to be done at this point.	Ko si iṣẹ pupọ ti o ku ni aaye yii.
I did not expect such a thing.	Emi ko reti iru nkan bẹẹ.
It was their something.	O je won nkankan.
By the time he went to bed.	Ni akoko ti o lọ si ibusun.
If you want to stop me, it will.	Ti o ba fẹ da mi duro, yoo ṣe.
And there is an explanation.	Ati pe alaye kan wa.
This can take weeks or months.	Eyi le gba awọn ọsẹ tabi awọn oṣu.
I should be more angry, maybe.	Mo yẹ ki o binu diẹ sii, boya.
One is obviously a really bad job.	Ọkan jẹ o han ni a gan buburu ise.
I can see why you can come to that conclusion.	Mo le rii idi ti o le wa si ipari yẹn.
Even people do.	Paapaa eniyan ṣe.
On the device.	Lori ẹrọ.
Just never again.	O kan ko lẹẹkansi.
They stopped and looked at me.	Wọn duro ati wo mi.
What are you going to do?	Kini o wa ma a se?
In your terms.	Ni awọn ofin rẹ.
However, this did not go the other way.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi ko lọ si ọna miiran.
His friends got into the game.	Awọn ọrẹ rẹ ti gba sinu ere.
If nothing else.	Ti ko ba si nkan miiran.
That thing will not help him.	Ohun yẹn kii yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
Sorry I can not help anymore.	Ma binu Emi ko le ṣe iranlọwọ mọ.
It works beautifully.	O ṣiṣẹ lẹwa.
I need your help.	Mo nilo iranlọwọ rẹ fun o.
One thing is for sure.	Ohun kan daju.
Or local or both.	Tabi agbegbe tabi awọn mejeeji.
I try to think beyond football.	Mo gbiyanju lati ronu kọja bọọlu.
So he continued.	Nitorina o tẹsiwaju.
Okay, almost everything.	O dara, o fẹrẹ jẹ ohun gbogbo.
This is very important to me.	Eyi ṣe pataki julọ fun mi.
Her teacher left for a long time.	Olukọ rẹ fi silẹ fun igba pipẹ.
New weather problems.	Awọn iṣoro tuntun ti oju ojo.
You need to get up early.	O nilo lati dide ni kutukutu.
We take that seriously.	A gba iyẹn ni pataki.
Know that it will just rise out of me.	Mọ pe yoo kan dide kuro ninu mi.
Once we get it back, you can get into it.	Ni kete ti a ba gba pada, o le wọ inu rẹ.
They look beautiful.	Wọn ti wo lẹwa.
Inside were two men.	Inu ti o wà ọkunrin meji.
You deserve everything you want.	O yẹ fun ohun gbogbo ti o fẹ.
I could be wrong.	Mo le ṣe aṣiṣe.
Thus, he said that one day the city will be under water.	Bayi, o sọ pe ni ọjọ kan ilu yoo wa labẹ omi.
However, it does not mean that you are compelled to do so.	Sibẹsibẹ, ko tumọ si pe o fi agbara mu ọ lati ṣe bẹ.
At the top the mother stands, like a beautiful woman.	Ni oke ni iya duro, bi a lẹwa obinrin.
I will stop here and read a book.	Emi yoo duro nibi ki o si ka iwe kan.
I don't want to do it here.	Emi ko fẹ lati ṣe nibi.
It's not easy at all.	Ko rọrun rara.
But he has a lot of friends.	Ṣugbọn o ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ.
Thus, it is not that simple.	Bayi, kii ṣe pe o rọrun.
It will be hot, you want to say.	O yoo gbona, o fẹ sọ.
Come on, baby.	Wa, ọmọ.
The game has stopped for a while.	Ere naa ti duro fun diẹ.
After a few minutes he spoke.	Lẹhin iṣẹju diẹ o sọrọ.
Whatever you want for him is still in your plans.	Ohunkohun ti o fẹ fun u si tun wa ninu eto rẹ.
You do not know anyone here.	O ko mọ ẹnikẹni nibi.
But that is not very possible.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣeeṣe pupọ.
That would be the right conclusion.	Iyẹn yoo jẹ ipari ti o tọ.
We just understand why it happened.	A kan loye idi ti o fi ṣẹlẹ.
He gave it all for this company.	O fun gbogbo rẹ fun ile-iṣẹ yii.
That has never happened.	Iyẹn ko tii ṣẹlẹ rara.
I have to continue my work.	Mo ni lati tẹsiwaju iṣẹ mi.
Much can happen in a year.	Pupọ le ṣẹlẹ ni ọdun kan.
It seems that a year before they can reach that point.	O dabi ẹni pe ọjọ ori kan ṣaaju ki wọn le de aaye naa.
That’s all my point is.	Iyẹn ni gbogbo aaye mi jẹ.
He wanted to start.	O fe lati bẹrẹ.
He did not pick up.	O ko gbe soke.
He lost some sight in one eye.	O padanu diẹ ninu oju ni oju kan.
There is no reason to.	Ko si idi lati.
A must man.	Ọkunrin ti o gbọdọ.
You need money.	O nilo owo.
It is the wrong material for the job.	O jẹ ohun elo ti ko tọ fun iṣẹ naa.
Do the same old things.	Ṣe awọn ohun atijọ kanna.
There is no time.	Ko si akoko kan.
Time how long this takes.	Akoko bi o gun yi gba.
And we need whatever we can get.	Ati pe a nilo eyikeyi ti a le gba.
But it’s not advice or anything like that.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe imọran tabi ohunkohun bi iyẹn.
Any way to do this ?.	Eyikeyi ọna lati ṣe eyi?.
We have come here to continue our studies.	A ti wa si ibi lati tẹsiwaju awọn ẹkọ wa.
He has a home forever.	O ni ile lailai.
Honestly, you have to be more honest.	Otitọ, o ni lati jẹ otitọ diẹ sii.
Thought is not art.	Ero kii ṣe aworan.
We haven't seen them very much.	A ko tii ri wọn pupọ.
They have to tie your hair back.	Wọn ni lati di irun rẹ pada.
People have more time than anything.	Awọn eniyan ni iye akoko diẹ sii ju ohunkohun lọ.
Kill two people from this store.	Pa awọn eniyan meji lati ile itaja yii.
It will do wonders for you.	Yoo ṣe ohun iyanu fun ọ.
We can not leave.	A ko le lọ kuro.
You have only me.	O ni emi nikan.
A little more.	Diẹ diẹ sii.
If you have time.	Ti o ba ni akoko.
Many of them, in particular, write letters.	Ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn, paapaa, kọ awọn lẹta.
I want to be on hand.	Mo fẹ lati wa ni ọwọ.
It will be.	Yoo si le.
I don't know him very well.	Emi ko mọ rẹ gaan.
He was very, very old.	O si wà gan gan atijọ.
Not in the way you think.	Kii ṣe ni ọna ti o ro.
He could not notice at all.	Ko le ṣe akiyesi rara.
They will find life for everyone.	Wọn yoo wa aye fun gbogbo eniyan.
She heard someone sleeping on her bed.	O gbọ ẹnikan ti o sun lori ibusun rẹ.
Both sides are even more beautiful.	Awọn ẹgbẹ mejeeji jẹ paapaa lẹwa paapaa.
But it has not arrived yet.	Ṣugbọn ko ti de sibẹsibẹ.
Parents are the same.	Awọn obi jẹ kanna.
I just do not know what to do.	Mo kan ko mọ kini lati ṣe.
For others, it will be something very new.	Fun awọn miiran, yoo jẹ nkan tuntun pupọ.
I will go and see the people.	Emi yoo lọ wo awọn eniyan naa.
But he got married and left.	Ṣugbọn o ni iyawo o si lọ.
To do that well takes time.	Lati ṣe iyẹn daradara gba akoko.
I will keep you.	Emi yoo pa ọ mọ.
It's in the grocery store.	O wa ni ile itaja itaja.
He began to drive.	O bẹrẹ si wakọ.
This is not one of those times.	Eyi kii ṣe ọkan ninu awọn akoko yẹn.
But it’s in everyone’s mind.	Ṣugbọn o ni inu gbogbo eniyan.
One way to live on my own.	Ọna kan lati gbe lori ara mi.
I would be right.	Emi yoo tọ.
I have everyone else to think about when making decisions.	Mo ni gbogbo eniyan miiran lati ronu nigbati n ṣe awọn ipinnu.
You can keep it close to you in your room.	O le pa a mọ nitosi rẹ ninu yara rẹ.
This situation is happening for a reason.	Ipo yii n ṣẹlẹ fun idi kan.
I would like to help.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
I knew him well for many years ago.	Mo mọ ọ daradara fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun sẹhin.
The youngsters sound like teenagers.	Awọn ọdọ naa dun bi awọn ọdọ.
This is a legal matter, not a family one.	Eyi jẹ ọrọ ofin, kii ṣe ti idile.
This is great.	Eyi dara julọ.
I quit my job.	Mo fi iṣẹ mi silẹ.
One, it works pretty much all the time.	Ọkan, o ṣiṣẹ lile lẹwa Elo ni gbogbo igba.
Now you have to pay the bill.	Bayi o ni lati san owo naa.
Do not forget to wash your hair.	Maṣe gbagbe lati wẹ irun rẹ.
But let’s not get away from that song.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki a ma lọ kuro ni orin naa.
Once a new baby is born in the family.	Ni kete ti a bi ọmọ tuntun ninu idile.
So that they can do what they want.	Ki wọn le ṣe ohun ti wọn fẹ.
It is your way to reach.	O jẹ ọna rẹ lati de ọdọ.
I hate them.	Mo korira wọn.
He was right about something.	O si tọ nipa ohun kan.
But of course we have had a big problem on our hands.	Ṣugbọn dajudaju a ti ni iṣoro nla lori ọwọ wa.
Everyone but their father knew that this would never happen.	Gbogbo eniyan ṣugbọn baba wọn mọ pe eyi kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
His father asked him.	Baba rẹ beere lọwọ rẹ.
But they should wait.	Ṣugbọn wọn yẹ ki o duro.
The police car had no sight.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ọlọpa ko ni oju.
A great job.	Iṣẹ nla kan.
Especially here in this room.	Paapaa nibi ninu yara yii.
I can't stand it anymore.	Nko le duro mo.
We will change the human body.	A yoo yi ara eniyan pada.
I have a few days off this week.	Mo ni isinmi ọjọ diẹ ni ọsẹ yii.
It's just nice to play.	O kan dara lati mu ṣiṣẹ.
He doesn't really think about them right now.	Oun ko ronu nipa wọn gaan ni bayi.
The sister came back.	Arabinrin naa tun pada wa.
Sorry but someone has to tell you.	Ma binu ṣugbọn ẹnikan ni lati sọ fun ọ.
He began to say something.	O bẹrẹ si sọ nkankan.
She is very scared of dogs.	O bẹru aja pupọ.
You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about.	O ko le ra a gbona aja fun awọn owo ti o ba sọrọ nipa.
That appeared on his face.	Iyẹn han loju oju rẹ.
What is your opinion on this?	Kini ero yin lori eyi?.
You can't talk to him.	O ko le ba a sọrọ.
Often can not.	Nigbagbogbo ko le.
I was on the wrong track, he thought.	Mo ti wa lori ọna ti ko tọ, o ro.
Thirty feet of clear space.	Ọgbọn ẹsẹ ti ko o aaye.
Maybe the word is key.	Boya ọrọ naa ni bọtini.
It has nothing to do with me.	Ko ṣe nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu mi.
Come on, tell me more.	Wa, sọ fun mi diẹ sii.
He walks to work all day.	O rin lati ṣiṣẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
That much is true.	Iyẹn Elo jẹ otitọ.
That is what we need.	Ohun ti a nilo niyẹn.
Maybe with it you are someone who can do anything.	Boya pẹlu rẹ o jẹ ẹnikan ti o le ṣe ohunkohun.
Same as you.	Kanna bi iwọ.
You understand that now.	O loye iyẹn ni bayi.
You don’t read the stuff, period.	O ko ka nkan naa, akoko.
So there you have two groups.	Nitorina nibẹ o ni awọn ẹgbẹ meji.
Leave it, because it was a mistake.	Fi silẹ, nitori pe o jẹ aṣiṣe.
In this case, one time may not be enough.	Ni iru eyi, igba kan le ma to.
But they ended up with incredibly strange situations.	Ṣugbọn wọn ti pari pẹlu awọn ipo iyalẹnu ti iyalẹnu.
I paused for a minute.	Mo da duro fun iṣẹju kan.
We must make sure that we hear their voice.	A gbọdọ rii daju pe a gbọ ohun wọn.
They held the letter, at first, for weeks.	Wọn di lẹta naa mu, ni akọkọ, fun awọn ọsẹ.
Some things happen.	Diẹ ninu awọn ohun kan ṣẹlẹ.
Now that is a new idea.	Bayi iyẹn jẹ ero tuntun.
But he did not accept that application.	Ṣugbọn ko gba ohun elo yẹn.
He hopes the water doesn’t hurt him.	O nireti pe omi ko ṣe ipalara rẹ.
And it works well.	Ati pe o n ṣiṣẹ daradara.
Well, that's it.	Bii, iyẹn ni o jẹ.
Eye for eye.	Oju fun oju.
They all passed without apparent injury.	Gbogbo wọn ti kọja laisi ipalara ti o han.
Until the door.	Titi ilẹkun.
No, you can not have that!	Rara, o ko le ni iyẹn!
Lots of stuff here.	Ọpọlọpọ nkan wa nibi.
If you want that, match it yourself.	Ti o ba fẹ iyẹn, ba ara rẹ mu.
He was not able to talk to her about it.	Ko ṣe anfani lati ba a sọrọ nipa eyi.
I do not want to ask.	Emi ko fẹ lati beere.
Very fast pass.	Julọ sare kọja.
Now more than ever.	Bayi diẹ sii ju lailai.
I will stay here with you.	Emi yoo duro nibi pẹlu rẹ.
Obviously there is work to be done here.	O han gbangba pe iṣẹ wa lati ṣe nibi.
They come from within, that's all.	Wọn ti wa lati inu inu rẹ, iyẹn ni gbogbo rẹ.
Is not beautiful.	Ṣe ko lẹwa.
And her hair.	Ati irun rẹ.
People want to help.	Eniyan fẹ lati ran.
Nice to see you.	O dara lati ri ọ.
Are you sure that is enough?	Ṣe o da ọ loju pe iyẹn to?
I do not remember why.	Emi ko ranti idi.
You do not recognize names.	O ko da awọn orukọ.
He saw his hand the other night.	O ri ọwọ rẹ ni alẹ miiran.
I'll run when you say run.	Emi yoo ṣiṣe nigbati o ba sọ ṣiṣe.
He could not separate them.	Ko le ya wọn kuro.
She is a sister.	Arabinrin ni.
I think the idea works.	Mo ro pe ero naa ṣiṣẹ.
He finds that he likes to drive it away.	O rii pe o fẹran pe o kọ ọ kuro.
Give me space.	Fun mi ni aye.
Open the application.	Ṣii ohun elo naa.
We speak of the same words.	A sọrọ ti awọn ọrọ kanna.
In fact, making games is a lot of hard work.	Ni otitọ, ṣiṣe awọn ere jẹ iṣẹ lile pupọ.
This is an easy way to attract them.	Eyi jẹ ọna ti o rọrun lati fa wọn sii.
But he left us with two questions.	Ṣugbọn o fi wa silẹ pẹlu awọn ibeere meji.
Someone accepts without question.	Ẹnikan gba laisi ibeere.
Well that just won't do.	Daradara ti o kan yoo ko ṣe.
He shook his head and walked towards the bed.	O mi ori o si rin si ọna ibusun.
It became something else at the end of the game.	O di nkan miiran ni ipari ere naa.
Go to sleep, baby.	Lọ sun, ọmọ.
We do not look down.	A kii wo isalẹ.
But once you do, you will be glad you did !.	Ṣugbọn ni kete ti o ba ṣe, iwọ yoo dun pe o ṣe!.
Tell me why you want it.	Sọ fun mi idi ti o fẹ.
And he was the only one who knew.	Ati pe oun nikan ni o mọ.
I don’t know if you ever knew that.	Emi ko mọ boya o lailai mọ pe.
Our return has been erroneous.	Pada wa ti jẹ aṣiṣe.
Everyone appears to have someone.	Gbogbo eniyan han lati ni ẹnikan.
I took them home now.	Mo ti mu wọn ile bayi.
In another story, another life, it could be great.	Ninu itan miiran, igbesi aye miiran, o le jẹ nla.
This will not be for me.	Eyi ko ni le fun mi.
If you love to travel, find ways to travel.	Ti o ba nifẹ lati rin irin-ajo, wa awọn ọna lati rin irin-ajo.
He tried to look around.	O gbiyanju lati wo nitosi.
Status of services.	Ipo ti awọn iṣẹ.
Works well for everyone.	Ti ṣiṣẹ daradara fun gbogbo eniyan.
With letters of course.	Pẹlu awọn lẹta dajudaju.
You are wrong, not me.	O ṣe aṣiṣe, kii ṣe emi.
You can contract with a company that builds a house.	O le ṣe adehun pẹlu awọn ile-iṣẹ kan ti o kọ ile.
But he did not love her.	Ṣugbọn oun ko nifẹ rẹ.
I know everything that happens.	Mo mọ ohun gbogbo ti o ṣẹlẹ.
They are right.	Wọn tọ.
But, as it turned out, it was worth it.	Ṣugbọn, bi o ti yipada, o tọ.
We need people to be on this journey with us.	A nilo awọn eniyan lati wa ni irin-ajo yii pẹlu wa.
The house is still standing.	Ile naa tun duro.
And you think it’s all great.	Ati pe o ro pe gbogbo rẹ jẹ nla.
This world is very hot.	Aye yii gbona pupọ.
She will leave next week.	O yoo lọ kuro ni ọsẹ miiran.
Maybe it suits me in a way.	Boya o dara fun mi ni ọna kan.
They are materials.	Wọn jẹ ohun elo.
You agree not to use your power outside your home.	O gba lati ko lo agbara rẹ ni ita ile rẹ.
Physical body.	Ara ti ara.
I like the names.	Mo feran awọn orukọ.
Much came to his wife.	Pupọ wa si iyawo rẹ.
I did not miss it.	Emi ko padanu rẹ.
I think it will pass.	Mo ro pe yoo kọja.
To do anything enough to let it go.	Lati ṣe ohunkohun ti o to lati jẹ ki o lọ.
But honestly, there is nothing wrong with that.	Ṣugbọn ni otitọ, ko si ohun ti ko tọ si pẹlu iyẹn.
I have never met her.	Emi ko tii pade rẹ ri.
That almost killed the book.	Iyẹn fẹrẹ pa iwe naa.
There is no way to cut.	Ko si ọna ti o ge.
Running, you say to yourself.	Ṣiṣe, o sọ fun ara rẹ.
Something is going to happen out there.	Nkan ti wa ni lilọ lati ṣẹlẹ jade nibẹ.
Doing something is a thing.	Ṣiṣe nkan jẹ nkan.
You have got something for everything.	O ti ni nkankan fun ohun gbogbo.
He said.	O si wipe.
But they will never feel anything, ever again.	Sugbon ti won yoo ko lero ohunkohun, lailai lẹẹkansi.
It tastes good to drink.	Maa dun tii lati mu.
It's getting smaller.	O ti n kere si.
We'd at least look at it better.	A fẹ ni o kere kan wo ni o dara.
But look out.	Ṣugbọn wo jade.
There is always a desire to cause harm.	Ifẹ lati fa ipalara nigbagbogbo wa.
I need to go out into it.	Mo nilo lati jade lọ sinu rẹ.
I may have finished that game.	Mo le ti pari ere yẹn.
I put everything into it.	Mo fi ohun gbogbo sinu rẹ.
I have no idea how to do it today.	Emi ko ni imọran bi o ṣe le ṣe loni.
They just do something up.	Wọn kan ṣe nkan soke.
Don’t let anyone lose sight of them.	Maṣe jẹ ki ẹnikẹni padanu oju wọn.
They are amazing people.	Wọn jẹ eniyan iyanu.
She did not laugh.	O ko rẹrin.
You have made your decision.	O ti ṣe ipinnu rẹ.
It’s just that the lights shouldn’t work.	O kan jẹ pe awọn ina ko yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ.
Now it is more than that.	Bayi o jẹ diẹ sii ju iyẹn lọ.
He grabbed his books.	O di awọn iwe rẹ mu.
It is raining in the area.	Ojo ro ni agbegbe naa.
Sit her down here.	Joko rẹ nibi.
It's about a minute.	O jẹ nipa iṣẹju kan.
Use it to allow yourself.	Lo o lati gba ara rẹ laaye.
Let me know if you have any questions.	Jẹ ki mi mọ ti o ba ti o ba ni eyikeyi ibeere.
They don’t worry about their clothes.	Wọn ko ṣe aniyan nipa aṣọ wọn.
First, you have to know what you are looking for.	Ni akọkọ, o ni lati mọ ohun ti o n wa.
Of course, he will.	Dajudaju, oun yoo.
Being angry is one of them.	Di binu jẹ ọkan ninu wọn.
However, that is changing.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn n yipada.
Soon, they came back together and played.	Laipẹ, wọn pada papọ ati dun.
Bring them lunch.	Mu wọn ounjẹ ọsan.
This was never intended to be the work of the people.	Eyi ko pinnu rara lati jẹ iṣẹ ti awọn eniyan.
I know them well.	Mo mọ wọn daradara.
The man was right.	Ọkunrin naa ti ṣe otitọ.
We have no idea what he did.	A ko ni imọran ohun ti o ṣe.
Remember to take a break when you need it.	Ranti lati ya isinmi nigbati o ba nilo rẹ.
It worked out.	O ti ṣiṣẹ jade.
But at least the facts are coming together.	Ṣugbọn o kere ju awọn otitọ n wa papọ.
He wanted to be strong.	O fe lati ni agbara.
Lots to think about.	Pupọ lati ronu nipa.
They want more big vacations.	Wọn fẹ awọn ibi isinmi nla diẹ sii.
We went into his car.	A lọ sinu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ.
There are several tables but enough seats.	Awọn tabili pupọ wa ṣugbọn awọn ijoko ti o to.
That is, more or less.	Iyẹn ni, diẹ sii tabi kere si.
I want to make sure people don’t forget me.	Mo fẹ lati rii daju pe awọn eniyan ko ni gbagbe mi.
I can write a book about this man.	Mo le kọ iwe kan nipa ọkunrin yii.
He was probably dead on his feet too.	O ṣee ṣe pe o ti ku lori ẹsẹ rẹ paapaa.
Can we do this ?.	Njẹ a le ṣe eyi?.
We know these things are true.	A mọ pe awọn nkan wọnyi jẹ otitọ.
You must have it.	O gbọdọ ni i.
Now it is gone.	Bayi o ti lọ.
We want to give life to stories.	A fe lati fi aye awon itan.
It was one of those years.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọdun yẹn.
I will not do that.	Emi kii yoo ṣe iyẹn.
I picked it up, and it just played again.	Mo gbe e soke, ati pe o kan tun dun lẹẹkansi.
It is not easy to grow up without a father.	Ko rọrun lati dagba laisi baba.
But there is not much to expect from me.	Ṣugbọn ko si pupọ ti yoo nireti fun mi.
Where we can be with those we love.	Ibi ti a le wa pẹlu awọn ti a nifẹ.
We try to get.	A gbiyanju lati gba.
You can’t believe it’s happening.	O ko le gbagbọ pe o n ṣẹlẹ.
Citizens were outraged by this decision.	Awọn ara ilu binu si ipinnu yii.
We live as well as we can.	A n gbe daradara bi a ti le ṣe.
And they slept well at night.	Ati pe wọn sun daradara ni alẹ.
You know why.	O mọ idi ti o jẹ.
There are other ways to get information.	Awọn ọna miiran wa lati gba alaye.
Everything is physical.	Ohun gbogbo ni ara.
Just my hand.	O kan ọwọ mi.
Don't pick it up here.	Maṣe gbe e soke nibi.
You may even know you are there.	O le paapaa mọ pe o wa nibẹ.
No future.	Ko si owo iwaju.
And it did not end there.	Ati pe ko pari nibẹ.
It was hard for the team.	O jẹ lile fun ẹgbẹ naa.
He can no longer notice it.	Ko le ṣe akiyesi rẹ mọ.
The question is whether they want you here.	Ibeere naa jẹ boya wọn fẹ ọ nibi.
We do not want to do that at all.	A ko fẹ ṣe iyẹn rara.
But that's all you need.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn julọ ti o nilo.
It was completely out of the system.	O je patapata jade ti awọn eto.
They were some fast girls and they came out to cause trouble.	Wọn diẹ ninu awọn ọmọbirin ti o yara ati pe wọn jade lati fa wahala.
We have the best.	A ni dara julọ.
Just paint.	O kan kun.
Few people are in and out.	Awọn eniyan diẹ wa ni ati jade.
This is a mistake.	Eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
She wants my help.	O fẹ iranlọwọ mi.
It seemed.	O dabi enipe.
Now everyone thinks he is dead.	Bayi ni gbogbo ro pe o ti ku.
You look at your watch.	O wo aago rẹ.
And everything works.	Ati ohun gbogbo ṣiṣẹ.
That is what we have been thinking about and we have been talking about for too long.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti a ti ro nipa ti a ti sọrọ nipa gun ju.
If they refuse, try not to drink it yourself.	Ti wọn ba kọ, gbiyanju lati ma ṣe mu funrararẹ.
Tom has little to say, period.	Tom ni kekere lati sọ, akoko.
This area has very little rain.	Agbegbe yii ni ojo kekere pupọ.
It will be hard, but the journey can continue.	Yoo jẹ lile, ṣugbọn irin-ajo naa le tẹsiwaju.
And, for a time, it was enough.	Ati, fun akoko kan, o ti to.
There will be plenty to do at the festival.	Ọpọlọpọ yoo wa lati ṣe ni ibi ayẹyẹ naa.
I try not to think.	Mo gbiyanju lati ma ronu.
He said he would see.	O sọ pe oun yoo rii.
We use them a lot.	A lo wọn pupọ.
Find out how.	Wa bawo ni.
There is no other way to insert.	Ko si ọna miiran lati fi sii.
I accept non-negotiable agreements.	Mo gba awọn adehun ko ṣe adehun.
But he can't say that right now.	Ṣugbọn ko le sọ iyẹn ni bayi.
I really think you are relaxing through.	Mo ro gaan pe o n ṣe isinmi nipasẹ.
To make people happy.	Lati jẹ ki inu eniyan dun.
I know we can reach an agreement.	Mo mọ pe a le de ọdọ adehun.
She jumped, she was scared.	O fo, o bẹru.
Box service for the area.	Iṣẹ apoti fun agbegbe.
You think you understand that.	O ro pe o loye iyẹn.
Maybe it's time to move on.	Boya o to akoko lati gbe.
The garden is beautiful.	Ọgba naa dara.
Your father will do whatever he wants.	Baba rẹ yoo ṣe ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
Now you have to send a text to yourself.	Bayi o ni lati fi ọrọ ranṣẹ si ara rẹ.
I would say it is not good.	Emi yoo sọ pe ko dara.
A serious test has arrived.	Idanwo to ṣe pataki ti de.
Give it up like that.	Fun u soke bi ti.
Not to be.	Kii ṣe lati jẹ.
He does not know where he lives.	Ko mọ ibi ti o ngbe.
Her other children have been fine.	Awọn ọmọ rẹ miiran ti dara.
He went to the table.	O lọ si tabili.
I wonder if you can do something with it.	Mo ro boya o le ṣe nkan pẹlu rẹ.
His car worked into a tree.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ ṣiṣẹ sinu igi kan.
I am not good at them.	Emi ko dara si wọn.
I repeat your words.	Mo tun ọrọ rẹ sọ.
I am happy.	Inu mi dun.
No, that is not a problem.	Rara, iyẹn kii ṣe iṣoro.
He did not move after the operation.	Ko gbe lẹhin iṣẹ naa pada.
This is a very good world to miss.	Eyi jẹ aye ti o dara pupọ lati padanu.
Let's get it.	Jẹ ká gba rẹ.
I just know you are coming here.	Mo kan mọ pe o n bọ nibi.
I tried everything out there.	Mo gbiyanju ohun gbogbo jade nibẹ.
This is easier when you have good information.	Eyi rọrun nigbati o ba ni alaye to dara.
It also does not handle tasks well.	O tun ko mu awọn iṣẹ mu daradara.
I asked him if he would find it.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ boya oun yoo rii.
No one in the car.	Ko si ẹnikan ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
Okay, it turned out and there was another one.	O dara, o yipada ati pe o wa ọkan miiran.
If you have a problem, speak up.	Ti o ba ni iṣoro, sọrọ soke.
I took in it.	Mo mu ninu rẹ.
If you can have it, cut it off.	Ti o ba le ni, o ti ge e kuro.
He could not have fallen there.	Ko le ti lọ silẹ nibẹ.
You can test a couple of things.	O le ṣe idanwo awọn nkan meji kan.
Tell me what to do.	Sọ fun mi kini lati ṣe.
Boats come from the water.	Awọn ọkọ oju omi wa lati ori omi.

What you expect is.	Ohun ti o reti ni.
Not much, he thought.	Kii ṣe pupọ, o ro.
There is no room for error in the police.	Ko si aaye fun aṣiṣe ni ọlọpa.
It will take about two hours.	Yoo gba to bii wakati meji.
I have every reason to love it.	Mo ni gbogbo idi lati nifẹ rẹ.
Write because you have to.	Kọ nitori o ni lati.
We have nothing to lose.	A ko ni nkankan lati padanu.
We look up.	A wo soke.
You get to try.	O gba lati gbiyanju.
This dog just won.	Aja yii kan gba.
Try again now, good boy.	Gbiyanju lẹẹkansi ni bayi, ọmọde ti o dara wa.
How do you say that?	Bawo ni o ṣe pe ọrọ yii?
It is impossible to say.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati sọ.
Babies put to bed.	Awọn ọmọ ti a fi sinu ibusun.
And of course, that time will be now.	Ati pe dajudaju, akoko yẹn yoo jẹ bayi.
The man has changed.	Ọkunrin naa ti yipada.
These requirements are met.	Awọn ibeere wọnyi ti pade.
And it is small.	Ati pe o jẹ kekere.
We have those who go to school every day.	A ni awọn ti o lọ si ile-iwe ni gbogbo ọjọ.
Sorry you can't find it.	Ma binu pe o ko le rii.
And the same goes for your children.	Ati awọn kanna lọ fun awọn ọmọ rẹ.
Others may use a service.	Awọn miiran le lo iṣẹ kan.
Look, the years may pass.	Wo, awọn ọdun le kọja.
And that makes me happy.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ ki inu mi dun.
Let's see what happens.	Jẹ ká wo ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
He doesn’t know much about it but knows it’s not something like that.	Ko mọ pupọ nipa rẹ ṣugbọn mọ pe kii ṣe nkankan bi iyẹn.
They don’t even know it’s there.	Wọn ko paapaa mọ pe o wa nibẹ.
You will have to go back and withdraw money.	Iwọ yoo ni lati pada sẹhin ki o mu owo jade.
Everyone hates them.	Gbogbo eniyan korira wọn.
It may be something that is happening in the store.	O le jẹ nkan ti n ṣẹlẹ ni ile itaja naa.
None of the words.	Ko si ninu awọn ọrọ.
It’s about it.	O jẹ nipa rẹ.
Too late.	O ti pẹ ju.
By phone.	Nipa foonu.
One of the most.	Ọkan ninu awọn julọ.
You know what to do.	O mọ kini lati ṣe.
He will leave the house.	Oun yoo jade kuro ni ile naa.
It has been recorded on it again.	O ti tun gba silẹ lori rẹ lẹẹkansi.
Both made mistakes, but they won.	Awọn mejeeji ṣe aṣiṣe, ṣugbọn wọn gba.
Okay, maybe not very important.	O dara, boya kii ṣe pataki pupọ.
And you can make sure it looks like.	Ati pe o le rii daju pe o dabi.
Whoever does it, they may still be dead.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ba ṣe, wọn le tun ti ku.
I know many of them well.	Mo ti mọ ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn daradara.
He reached the table and took my hand.	O de ori tabili o si mu ọwọ mi.
He is in his house now.	O wa ninu ile rẹ ni bayi.
And we came back.	Ati pe a pada wa.
I was late for a meeting because of this big car.	Mo ti pẹ fun ipade kan nitori ọkọ nla yii.
You will not have to do this alone.	Iwọ kii yoo ni lati ṣe eyi nikan.
I have a very good idea.	Mo ni imọran to dara julọ.
I will let you accept the agreement.	Emi yoo jẹ ki o gba adehun naa.
You have the same reasons.	O ni awọn idi kanna.
I would have done better not to let him see me like this.	Emi yoo ti ṣe dara julọ lati ma jẹ ki o rii mi bi eleyi.
Maybe it has been.	Boya o ti wa.
I hope you come back to read this.	Mo nireti pe o pada wa lati ka eyi.
I’ll talk about that in a minute.	Emi yoo sọrọ nipa iyẹn ni iṣẹju kan.
I slept alone.	Mo sun nikan.
So just really hard.	Nitorina o kan gan lile.
I just want you to think about this with me.	Mo kan fẹ ki o ronu nipa eyi pẹlu mi.
You have to do most of the work yourself.	O ni lati ṣe pupọ julọ iṣẹ naa funrararẹ.
That's very good.	Iyẹn dara pupọ.
But this time, he heard the ideas.	Ṣugbọn ni akoko yii, o gbọ awọn ero.
Before the test.	Ṣaaju idanwo.
More teams will be available this season.	Awọn ẹgbẹ diẹ sii yoo wa ni akoko yii.
I promise to take care of this thing well.	Mo ṣe ileri lati tọju nkan yii daradara.
I probably do.	Mo jasi tun ṣe.
I love what the future holds.	Mo fẹran ohun ti ọjọ iwaju jẹ.
Time to give some attention.	Akoko lati fun diẹ ninu akiyesi.
It is already used.	O ti lo tẹlẹ.
Whatever it is, it starts young.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ, o bẹrẹ odo.
Even now they are calling for help.	Paapaa ni bayi wọn n pe fun iranlọwọ.
I like the idea.	Mo fẹran imọran naa.
Just there to watch.	O kan wa nibẹ lati wo.
Do this for only two weeks.	Ṣe eyi fun ọsẹ meji nikan.
Explain the background to the game.	Ṣe alaye lẹhin si ere naa.
This is what has been going on for years.	Eyi ni ohun ti n lọ fun awọn ọdun.
He said as he saw it.	O sọ bi o ti ri.
Which left only the other way around.	Eyi ti o fi silẹ nikan ni ọna miiran.
That happens on rainy days.	Iyẹn ṣẹlẹ ni awọn ọjọ ti ojo.
They are gone now.	Wọn ti lọ bayi.
But it will happen.	Ṣugbọn yoo ṣẹlẹ.
It is a house with many rooms.	O jẹ ile ti o ni ọpọlọpọ awọn yara.
And the best thing is knowing how to sell.	Ati ohun ti o mọ julọ ni bi o ṣe le ta.
I am nothing and I have nothing.	Emi ko jẹ nkankan ati pe ko ni nkankan.
It’s the little things in life.	O jẹ awọn nkan kekere ni igbesi aye.
This will help with them.	Eyi yoo ṣe iranlọwọ pẹlu wọn.
And, in the end, it is possible for the better.	Ati, ni ipari, o ṣee ṣe fun dara julọ.
Okay, that’s one of us.	O dara, iyẹn ṣe ọkan ninu wa.
It almost got me even.	O fẹrẹ gba mi paapaa.
There are two ways to obtain such power.	Awọn ọna meji lo wa lati gba iru agbara bẹẹ.
But on me it just doesn't work.	Ṣugbọn lori mi o kan ko ṣiṣẹ.
Climb up, work done.	O gun oke, iṣẹ ti pari.
‘When’ is very important.	'Nigba ti' jẹ pataki pupọ.
I can do that.	Mo ti le ṣe bẹ.
He looked at me as he spoke.	O wo mi bi o ti n sọrọ.
You must be the one who gave it to the police.	O gbọdọ jẹ ẹniti o fun ọlọpa.
I have to see you.	Mo ni lati ri ọ.
Stay on top of it.	Duro lori rẹ.
They will not let me go.	Wọn kii yoo jẹ ki mi lọ.
Water as one even.	Omi bi ọkan paapaa.
The temptation will not meet for one more reason.	Idanwo naa ko ni pade fun idi kan diẹ sii.
There was not any fun and winning.	Nibẹ je ko eyikeyi fun ati ki o gba.
Take one more.	Mu ọkan diẹ sii.
With his father, say.	Pẹlu baba rẹ, sọ.
We leave our beloved family.	A fi idile ti a feran.
It is the state of one.	O jẹ ipo ti ọkan.
He doesn't like it.	Ko feran re.
I moved away from her.	Mo ti gbe kuro lati ọwọ rẹ.
Learn and move on.	Kọ ẹkọ ati tẹsiwaju.
You get to move.	O gba lati gbe.
He has great power.	O ni agbara nla.
What made you decide to come today?	Kini o jẹ ki o pinnu lati wa loni?
You have to keep this matter going.	O ni lati mu ọrọ yii tẹsiwaju.
Things you can’t get back.	Awọn nkan ti o ko le gba pada.
She looked at the newspaper.	O wo iwe iroyin naa.
The phone is already playing.	Foonu naa ti n dun tẹlẹ.
We will stay again if you are in the area.	A yoo duro lẹẹkansi ti o ba wa ni agbegbe.
We will miss them very much.	A yoo padanu wọn gidigidi.
Like this.	Bi eleyi.
It is hoped that the brochure will help.	A ti nireti pe iwe alaye yoo ṣe iranlọwọ.
He can't even speak well.	Ko le paapaa sọrọ daradara.
Someone with metal bodies.	Ẹnikan pẹlu awọn ara ti irin.
I'll just go home.	Emi yoo kan lọ si ile.
But nothing happened.	Sugbon ti ohunkohun ko ṣe.
I lost sight of him, but the words did not stop.	Mo padanu oju rẹ, ṣugbọn awọn ọrọ ko duro.
It was under the table, by my feet.	O wa labẹ tabili, nipasẹ awọn ẹsẹ mi.
This is a woman who knows she will be open to your attention.	Eyi ni obinrin ti o mọ pe yoo ṣii si akiyesi rẹ.
Nothing.	Ko si ohun kan.
This is not heard at all.	Eyi ko gbọ rara.
I got up from the head.	Mo dide lati ori lori.
It looks amazing.	O dabi iyanu.
This city is designed for walking.	Ilu yi ti a ṣe fun rin.
The same hand does both.	Ọwọ kanna ni o ṣe awọn mejeeji.
My whole life.	Gbogbo aye mi.
Here's how to put one together for use with your home.	Eyi ni bii o ṣe tọju rẹ dara julọ.
There is no small space at this point.	Ko si aye kekere ni aaye yii.
When taken away.	Nigba ti a ba mu kuro.
Something will happen as you get information.	Nkankan yoo ṣẹlẹ bi o ṣe gba alaye.
Just sweet, sweet, sweet.	O kan dun, dun, dun.
One of two things will happen.	Ọkan ninu awọn nkan meji yoo ṣẹlẹ.
But that is not enough.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko to.
But it has to be done.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati ṣee.
You can not sleep.	O ko le sun.
I'm glad to know.	Inu mi dun lati mọ.
Maybe you expect too much for him.	Boya o nireti pupọ fun u.
Thoughts come with it.	Awọn ero wa pẹlu rẹ.
Some things cannot change.	Diẹ ninu awọn nkan ko le yipada.
I am completely different.	Emi ni ohun miiran patapata.
He was a local boy.	O jẹ ọmọkunrin agbegbe kan.
We have to continue.	A ni lati tẹsiwaju.
Out of them.	Jade ninu wọn.
Outside interest, as you might say.	Anfani ita, bi o ṣe le sọ.
They have money to pay.	Won ni owo lati san.
They cannot be sure whether their decisions are right or wrong.	Wọn ko le ni idaniloju boya awọn ipinnu wọn tọ.
How we made a mistake.	Bawo ni a ti ṣe aṣiṣe.
I also got up.	Emi naa dide.
Little by little, month by month, year by year,	Diẹ diẹ, oṣu nipa oṣu, ọdun nipasẹ ọdun,
I do not know what happened to you.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si ọ.
You will quickly forget them.	Iwọ yoo yara gbagbe wọn.
Because tomorrow will not be there.	Nitori ọla kii yoo wa nibẹ.
The community is a place where people live.	Agbegbe jẹ aaye ti awọn eniyan n gbe.
I would be the first to do so.	Emi yoo jẹ akọkọ lati ṣe.
She's afraid of everything.	O n bẹru ohun gbogbo.
Only the most important.	Nikan awọn pataki julọ.
That happened before you were born.	Iyẹn ṣẹlẹ ṣaaju ki a to bi ọ.
She loves to drive and is good to do.	O nifẹ lati wakọ ati pe o dara lati ṣe.
You build one.	O kọ ọkan.
It doesn't look like here.	Ko dabi nibi.
We will see how it looks when we drink.	A yoo ri bi o ti ri nigba ti a ba mu.
I am asleep.	Mo ti sun.
Notice the two big ones.	Ṣe akiyesi awọn nla meji.

I waited more.	Mo duro diẹ sii.
I can think.	Mo le ronu.
And the sun will go down but it is still warm.	Ati pe oorun yoo lọ silẹ ṣugbọn o tun gbona.
There are also books, bad books.	Awọn iwe tun wa, awọn iwe buburu.
But we went a long way this week.	Ṣugbọn a lọ ni ọna pipẹ ni ọsẹ yii.
To run you just need a pair and a pair of shoes.	Lati ṣiṣe o kan nilo ọna kan ati bata bata.
There is a story behind this.	Itan kan wa lẹhin eyi.
So the house did not leave.	Nitorina ile ko kuro.
They are very good, and very simple.	Wọn dara pupọ, ati pe o rọrun pupọ.
There is nothing serious that can be said about it.	Ko si ohun to ṣe pataki ti o le sọ nipa rẹ.
It's hard to see.	O jẹ gidigidi lati wo.
This is a difficult task.	Eyi jẹ iṣẹ ti o nira.
They gave me a hard cash position.	Wọn fun mi ni ipo owo lile.
We just went to get.	A kan lọ gba.
He was out of thought.	O si wà jade ti ero.
After the song, they sat down to talk.	Lẹhin orin, wọn joko lati sọrọ.
The higher the demand for an item, the higher the error.	Ti o ga julọ ibeere fun ohun kan, aṣiṣe ti o ga julọ.
No question to see anything else.	Ko si ibeere lati ri ohunkohun miiran.
You have to think you can get away with it.	O ni lati ro pe o le lọ kuro pẹlu rẹ.
Will have to do.	Yoo ni lati ṣe.
You need to come back, he said.	O nilo lati pada wa, o sọ.
He has not told her yet.	O ti ko so fun u sibẹsibẹ.
In other words, it looks good, good.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, o dabi pe o dara, o dara.
He did the same.	O tun ṣe bẹ.
I have not seen anyone.	Nko ri enikeni ri.
We do not think such a thing is possible.	A ko ro pe iru nkan bẹẹ ṣee ṣe.
The world can only say life.	Aye le sọ igbesi aye nikan.
Do not change your name yet.	Maṣe lọ yi orukọ rẹ pada sibẹsibẹ.
Throw me into the water.	Ju mi sinu omi.
Think about one of your ideas.	Ronu nipa ọkan ninu awọn ero rẹ.
Both are now dead.	Mejeeji ti ku bayi.
Reach out to her.	De ọdọ rẹ.
Nothing easy.	Ko si ohun ti o rọrun.
Not coming back in a minute, either.	Ko pada wa ni iṣẹju kan, boya.
I pretty much can't help it.	Mo lẹwa Elo ko le ran o.
She said she was happy.	O sọ pe inu rẹ dun.
It may become your attention, that person.	O le di akiyesi rẹ, eniyan yẹn.
But someone put it here for a reason.	Ṣugbọn ẹnikan fi o nibi fun idi kan.
Only now do you understand why.	Nikan ni bayi o loye idi.
You can drive around it one day.	O le wakọ ni ayika rẹ ni ọjọ kan.
The boy's clothes stood out.	Aṣọ ọmọkunrin naa duro jade.
Come on board.	Wa lori ọkọ.
I want to have them in the book.	Mo fẹ lati ni wọn ninu iwe.
A foot has been attached to it.	A ti fi ẹsẹ kan si i.
It makes it impossible to finish anything.	O jẹ ki ko ṣee ṣe lati pari ohunkohun.
If they kill, we buy them.	Ti wọn ba pa, a ra wọn.
And it doesn't seem to be that easy.	Ati pe ko dabi pe o ti fẹrẹ rọrun.
The task is difficult but rewarding.	Iṣẹ naa nira ṣugbọn o ni ere.
We never talked about it.	A ko sọrọ nipa rẹ rara.
I know we will be together again.	Mo mọ pe a yoo wa papọ lẹẹkansi.
Time and leave to cool.	Akoko ati ki o lọ kuro lati dara.
They raised their eyes a little.	Wọn gbe oju wọn soke diẹ diẹ.
You can not get over it.	O ko le gba lori rẹ.
I'll see to that myself.	Emi yoo rii si iyẹn funrararẹ.
So we have to do the same.	Nitorina a ni lati ṣe kanna.
Where to stay.	Nibo ni yoo ṣee duro.
I did not go there.	Emi ko lọ si ibi yẹn.
I’m pretty sure there’s only one available.	Mo ni idaniloju pe o jẹ ọkan nikan ti o wa.
We have to remember to take the time to enjoy it.	A ni lati ranti lati ya akoko lati gbadun rẹ.
When the metal is hot, it becomes liquid.	Nigbati irin ba gbona, o di omi.
If you think music will make you better let me know.	Ti o ba ro pe orin yoo jẹ ki o dara julọ jẹ ki mi mọ.
This has no history.	Eyi ko ni itan.
I think you will think so.	Mo ro pe o yoo ro bẹ.
How nice to laugh.	Bawo ni o ṣe dara lati rẹrin.
And remove.	Ki o si yọ kuro.
I want to be mine.	Mo fẹ lati jẹ mi.
You must hurry.	O gbọdọ yara.
But some get only bad.	Ṣugbọn diẹ ninu awọn gba nikan ni buburu.
Most of us will not.	Pupọ wa kii yoo.
A little better will break.	Diẹ ti o dara yoo fọ.
A few other friends have really enjoyed this summer too.	Awọn ọrẹ diẹ miiran ti gbadun pupọ ni igba ooru yii paapaa.
This system is light and easy to carry.	Eto yii jẹ ina ati rọrun lati gbe.
He said it helped people.	O sọ pe o ran eniyan lọwọ.
If you can work less.	Ti o ba jẹ pe o le ṣiṣẹ kere si.
You forgot yourself.	O gbagbe ara rẹ.
Kids always want to know things.	Awọn ọmọde nigbagbogbo fẹ lati mọ awọn nkan.
He left to wonder who he was.	O fi silẹ lati ṣe iyalẹnu ẹniti o jẹ.
Very visible work.	Iṣẹ ti o han gaan.
I learned that the hard way.	Mo kọ iyẹn ni ọna lile.
They are worth nothing.	Wọn ti wa ni tọ ohunkohun.
He loves me.	O fẹran mi.
This is incredibly amazing.	Eyi jẹ iyalẹnu ti iyalẹnu.
I give it to you.	Mo fun yin.
You know it's more than that.	O mọ pe o ju iyẹn lọ.
It was published.	A gbe e jade.
Now is not the time.	Ni bayi kii ṣe akoko naa.
It took my time at home.	O gba akoko mi ni ile.
Please think about that.	Jọwọ ronu lori iyẹn.
It’s not even a little bit.	O ko paapaa diẹ diẹ.
But he moved so he could see her.	Ṣugbọn o gbe ki o le ri i.
The boys are doing a good job with it.	Awọn ọmọkunrin n ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara pẹlu rẹ.
There goes that theory.	Nibẹ lọ pe yii.
That is what we need to know.	Ohun ti a nilo lati mọ niyẹn.
Here is what you can expect.	Eyi ni ohun ti o le reti.
Again, we do not know.	Lẹẹkansi, a ko mọ.
You are going about this completely the wrong way.	O n lọ nipa eyi patapata ni ọna ti ko tọ.
We sat in the living room.	A joko ninu yara nla.
At least people do.	O kere julọ eniyan ṣe.
And they know what they did a lot.	Ati pe wọn mọ ohun ti wọn ṣe pupọ.
I'm not used to anything.	Emi ko lo fun ohunkohun.
They take pictures of what they feel.	Wọn ya awọn aworan ti ohun ti wọn lero.
It cannot be kept out of it.	A ko le pa a mọ kuro ninu rẹ.
It does not hurt at all.	Ko ṣe ipalara gaan.
I suspect my dad stole the money.	Mo fura pe baba mi ji owo naa.
But they did nothing.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko ṣe nkankan.
It just can't happen.	O kan ko le ṣẹlẹ.
Take you home, it’s all in one piece.	Mu ọ lọ si ile, gbogbo rẹ ni nkan kan.
I love that in the morning.	Mo nifẹ iyẹn ni owurọ.
He can not walk.	Ko le rin.
Only he did not get there.	Nikan o ko de nibẹ.
There are times when.	Awọn igba wa nigba ti o.
I see the problem.	Mo ri iṣoro naa.
The same goes for other situations.	Kanna n lọ fun awọn ipo miiran.
Her children never came home.	Awọn ọmọ rẹ ko wa si ile rara.
He wanted his life made up for it.	O fe aye re ṣe soke fun u.
Not good, either.	Ko si dara, boya.
But think for a minute, that they are not.	Ṣugbọn ronu fun iṣẹju kan, pe wọn ko si.
A place to grow.	Ibi kan lati dagba.
He was a man of few words.	O jẹ ọkunrin ti ọrọ diẹ.
You see yourself.	O wo ara rẹ.
Try one or two passes to the team members.	Gbiyanju ọkan tabi meji kọja si awọn ẹgbẹ ẹgbẹ.
However, the meal plans are excellent.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn eto ounjẹ dara julọ.
I need someone to walk me through.	Mo nilo ẹnikan lati rin mi nipasẹ.
Leave work as soon as you arrive.	Fi iṣẹ silẹ ni kete ti o ba de.
None of them, any of them.	Ko si ko si ọkan ninu wọn, eyikeyi ninu wọn.
My father was also there.	Baba mi tun wa nibẹ.
He said he would like that better.	O sọ pe oun yoo fẹ iyẹn dara julọ.
Tell me everything you told me.	Sọ ohun gbogbo ti o sọ fun mi.
I hit him and he had no problems.	Mo lu u ati pe ko ni awọn iṣoro eyikeyi.
How do you do.	Bawo ni o ṣe ṣe.
We see that.	A ri iyẹn.
Of course, they did not go the other way.	Dajudaju, wọn ko lọ ni ọna miiran.
It is very important.	O ṣe pataki pupọ.
You mean.	O tumọ si.
And it needs to help us get back on track.	Ati pe o nilo lati ran wa lọwọ lati gba pada.
He is angry.	O binu.
They can not kill everything.	Wọn ko le pa ohun gbogbo.
They hate what’s going on.	Wọn korira ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
I am an intelligent brother.	Arakunrin to loye ni mi.
Like something here.	Bi nkan kan wa nibi.
It is better to let him die now.	O dara lati jẹ ki o ku ni bayi.
Please I need more information.	Jọwọ Mo fẹ alaye diẹ.
She tried to sleep, but it never happened.	O gbiyanju lati sun, ṣugbọn ko ṣẹlẹ rara.
But it is very important.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ pataki pupọ.
He opened the book again.	O tun ṣii iwe naa lẹẹkansi.
I just want it all over.	Mo kan fẹ ki gbogbo rẹ pari.
I know they don’t have any words about what’s good.	Mo mọ pe wọn ko ni eyikeyi ọrọ nipa ohun ti o dara.
We are husband and wife.	A jẹ ọkunrin ati iyawo.
And his father didn’t know he was here, not yet.	Ati baba rẹ ko mọ pe o wa nibi, ko sibẹsibẹ.
We did not return.	A ko pada.
By doing this.	Nipa ṣiṣe eyi.
It is also great.	O tun jẹ nla.
This is up to you.	Eyi wa lori rẹ.
Why not now ?.	Kilode ti kii ṣe bayi?.
We will change in time.	A yoo yipada ni akoko.
But that shouldn’t work.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko yẹ ki o mu ṣiṣẹ.
Marriage to him.	Igbeyawo fun u.
These are not the same thing.	Awọn wọnyi kii ṣe ohun kanna.
It has grown a few days ago.	O ti dagba ni awọn ọjọ diẹ sẹhin.
This is very good.	Eyi dara pupọ.
But there is no future for me here in this place.	Ṣugbọn ko si ọjọ iwaju fun mi nibi ni ibi yii.
It is a community and a home.	O jẹ agbegbe ati ile kan.
The river is nearby.	Odo wa nitosi.
For my country.	Fun ilu mi.
And it was a big mistake.	Ati pe o jẹ aṣiṣe nla kan.
Some believe it is right.	Diẹ ninu awọn gbagbọ pe o tọ.
That would be great for you.	Iyẹn yoo dara julọ fun ọ.
You only get to play this game longer.	O nikan gba lati mu ere yi gun.
This may not be true.	Eyi ko le jẹ otitọ.
Maybe some of them are better than this.	Boya ninu wọn ti dara ju eyi lọ.
Your work requires the most feasible skills.	Iṣẹ rẹ nilo awọn ọgbọn ti o ṣeeṣe julọ julọ.
I will keep you in the picture.	Emi yoo pa ọ mọ ninu aworan naa.
You have to know what’s going on.	O ni lati mọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ.
This has been a great big day.	Eyi ti jẹ ọjọ nla nla kan.
It happened last week.	O ṣẹlẹ ni ọsẹ to kọja.
Two systems are possible.	Awọn ọna ṣiṣe meji ṣee ṣe.
He came to me.	O wa si ọdọ mi.
You do not have to allow it.	O ko ni lati gba laaye.
I love old books.	Mo nifẹ awọn iwe atijọ.
He drove to his mother's house if at all.	O wakọ lọ si ile iya rẹ bi o ba jẹ pe.
That has never happened before.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ tẹlẹ.
No, we do not have a table.	Rara, a ko ni tabili.
This can happen for a few reasons.	Eyi le ṣẹlẹ fun awọn idi diẹ.
I have who it is.	Mo ni ẹniti o jẹ.
I want to stop it.	Mo fe da a duro.
I am not afraid anymore.	Emi ko bẹru mọ.
Just say when we will start.	Nikan sọ nigbati a yoo bẹrẹ.
Don't overdo it.	Maṣe lo ju.
He will need a new pair of shoes.	Oun yoo nilo bata tuntun.
I'll find another way around.	Emi yoo wa ọna miiran ni ayika.
He sent me some money.	O fi owo diẹ ranṣẹ si mi.
Some just groups, some not.	Diẹ ninu awọn kan awọn ẹgbẹ, diẹ ninu awọn ko.
Hair and face.	Irun ati oju.
They leave room for everyone.	Wọn fi aaye silẹ fun gbogbo eniyan.
He went home after school with his mother every day.	O si lọ si ile lẹhin ile-iwe pẹlu iya rẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
I have no children.	Emi ko ni awọn ọmọde.
This works well when you know what you are looking for.	Eyi ṣiṣẹ daradara nigbati o mọ ohun ti o n wa.
Many of you do not understand.	Pupọ ninu rẹ ko ni oye.
To do so, learn how to do it.	Lati ṣe bẹ, kọ ẹkọ bi o ti le ṣe.
Some cities are flooded.	Diẹ ninu awọn ilu ti wa ni omi.
I do not know where it is.	Emi ko mọ ibiti o wa.
Such a situation is here.	Iru ipo naa wa nibi.
Feeling just a little because of that.	Rilara diẹ nikan nitori iyẹn.
In the rainy season.	Ni akoko ojo.
They need space to move.	Wọn nilo aaye lati gbe.
New life, maybe.	Igbesi aye tuntun, boya.
Because as you see it now.	Nitori bi o ti ri bayi.
This gives you the first.	Eyi fun ọ ni akọkọ.
He lost his job after a year.	O padanu iṣẹ rẹ lẹhin ọdun kan.
He will be happy if we do not come back.	Inu re yoo dun ti a ko ba pada wa.
Let me explain this way.	Jẹ ki n ṣe alaye ni ọna yii.
Everyone is scared.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o bẹru.
It may be some other thing as we work through.	O le jẹ diẹ ninu awọn nkan miiran bi a ṣe n ṣiṣẹ nipasẹ.
I have built my own life.	Mo ti kọ igbesi aye ara mi.
Try to eat more often.	Gbiyanju lati jẹun diẹ nigbagbogbo.
He asked why we were doing what we were doing.	O beere idi ti a fi n ṣe ohun ti a n ṣe.
Or my mother.	Tabi iya mi.
It gives another week, maybe.	O fun ni ọsẹ miiran, boya.
We can not find anything.	A ko le ri nkankan.
I need to read this today.	Mo nilo lati ka eyi loni.
None of us know what it is.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa mọ ohun ti o jẹ mọ.
He alone is long.	Oun nikan gun.
Come try today.	Wa gbiyanju loni.
That restaurant makes excellent food.	Ile ounjẹ yẹn ṣe awọn ounjẹ ounjẹ ti o dara julọ.
The more the details the better.	Awọn alaye diẹ sii dara julọ.
This, on its own, pretty much destroys everything.	Eyi, lori ara rẹ, lẹwa pupọ ba gbogbo nkan jẹ.
The moment of truth is at hand.	Akoko ti otitọ wa ni ọwọ.
You go with that.	O lọ pẹlu iyẹn.
This is not to be seen now.	Eyi kii ṣe lati rii ni bayi.
Any remaining errors and problems are my own.	Eyikeyi awọn aṣiṣe ti o ku ati awọn iṣoro jẹ ti ara mi.
Ask before and after.	Beere ṣaaju ki o to lẹhin.
Make sure that is the right thing to do.	Ni idaniloju pe iyẹn ni ohun ti o tọ lati ṣe.
I can feel it working in me.	Mo le lero pe o ṣiṣẹ ninu mi.
Most of the time, the rule seems to work.	Ni igba pupọ, ofin naa dabi pe o ṣiṣẹ.
They can be like me.	Wọn le dabi emi.
Listen to people who have known me all my life.	Gbọ awọn eniyan ti o ti mọ mi gbogbo aye mi.
I am not feeling well.	Ara mi ko dara.
To many others.	Si ọpọlọpọ awọn miiran.
There are three main issues.	Awọn ọrọ pataki mẹta wa.
I ate a little.	Mo ti jẹun diẹ.
The brother is very nice.	Arakunrin naa dara pupọ.
Nothing to see, nothing to hear.	Ko si nkankan lati ri, ko si nkankan lati gbọ.
We’ve started some, and we’ve looked at them.	A ti bẹrẹ diẹ ninu, ati pe a ti wo wọn.
I received a gift one day, a box of music.	Mo gba ẹbun ni ọjọ kan, apoti orin kan.
Soon we will be able to travel into space.	Laipẹ a yoo ni anfani lati rin irin-ajo sinu aaye.
Store letters or pictures.	Tọju awọn lẹta tabi awọn aworan.
So in the end it went.	Nitorina ni ipari o lọ.
You should kill it.	O yẹ ki o pa a.
You have a problem here.	Iwọ ni iṣoro nibi.
I do not know if you are trying.	Emi ko mọ pe o n gbiyanju.
Look, behind the bar!	Wo, lẹhin igi!
Some work but stop.	Diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ ṣugbọn da.
All the time.	Ni gbogbo igba.
But I am the only one.	Ṣugbọn emi nikan ni o wa.
Okay, this is it.	O dara, eyi ni.
Always do one thing at a time.	Nigbagbogbo ṣe ohun kan ni akoko kan.
In my house.	Ninu ile mi.
However, when you need them, they are not there.	Sibẹsibẹ, nigbati o ba nilo wọn, wọn ko si nibẹ.
You may even decide that your dog is taller.	O le paapaa pinnu pe aja rẹ ga julọ.
Even when you don’t need them right now.	Paapaa nigbati o ko nilo wọn ni bayi.
He began to interact with the objects around the room.	O bẹrẹ lati ṣe ararẹ pẹlu awọn nkan ni ayika yara naa.
Say, 'he said.	Sọ,' o sọ.
We should let it be.	A yẹ ki o jẹ ki o jẹ.
Very good it made me there.	Pupọ ti o dara o ṣe mi nibẹ.
I miss you so much.	Mo padanu rẹ gidigidi.
It must be that time of year again.	O gbọdọ jẹ akoko yẹn ti ọdun lẹẹkansi.
The world should know this.	Aye yẹ ki o mọ eyi.
For the back.	Fun ẹhin.
We want to clean the room.	A fẹ lati nu yara naa.
We have been working on it for months.	A ti n ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ fun awọn oṣu.
That was probably good, but it didn't feel good.	Ti o wà jasi ti o dara, sugbon o ko lero ti o dara.
You want to know the time.	O fẹ lati mọ akoko naa.
The heat rushed to his face.	Ooru sare si oju rẹ.
They want a book or they don’t want to.	Wọn fẹ iwe kan tabi wọn ko fẹ.
It will hit.	O yoo lu.
Maybe that’s because fewer people are getting jobs.	Boya iyẹn jẹ nitori pe eniyan diẹ ti n gba iṣẹ.
You and your men will be with us.	Iwọ ati awọn ọkunrin rẹ yoo wa pẹlu wa.
You are wrong.	O ṣe aṣiṣe.
I'm sorry, it took me a long time.	Ma binu pe o gba mi to gun.
Be there, do that.	Ti wa nibẹ, ṣe iyẹn.
They told us about bad food.	Wọn sọ fun wa nipa ounjẹ buburu.
Some speak for themselves.	Diẹ ninu awọn sọ fun ara wọn.
But not a look.	Ṣugbọn ko kan wo.
His story is amazing.	Itan rẹ jẹ iyalẹnu.
I know people who know.	Mo mọ awọn eniyan ti o mọ.
If you do not stop, you will be angry.	Ti o ko ba duro, iwọ yoo binu.
I hope it will be good one day.	Mo nireti pe yoo dara ni ọjọ kan.
I think it could be so.	Mo ro pe o le jẹ bẹ.
I don’t want you to worry.	Emi ko fẹ ki o ni aniyan.
He even said it was.	O sọ paapaa o jẹ.
There is a charge to enter the area.	Owo kan wa lati wọ agbegbe naa.
He will, of course, cut again before returning.	Oun yoo, dajudaju, ge lẹẹkansi ṣaaju ki o to pada wa.
He has only lived since then.	O ngbe nikan lati igba naa.
You should read my books.	O yẹ ki o ka awọn iwe mi.
I'm almost back.	Mo ti fẹrẹ pada.
They will not work.	Wọn kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
You have to find something fixed.	O gbọdọ wa ohun ti o wa titi.
Tell him and tell him about your problems.	Sọ fun u ki o sọ fun u nipa awọn iṣoro rẹ.
He could not move.	Ko le gbe.
We need two for these people.	A nilo meji fun awọn eniyan wọnyi.
I need to do this.	Mo nilo lati ṣe eyi.
But he was not convinced.	Ṣugbọn ko da oun loju iyẹn.
But this time.	Sugbon akoko yi.
Teach someone how to ride.	Kọ ẹnikan bi o ṣe le gun.
Some of the work they do is also needed.	Diẹ ninu awọn iṣẹ ti wọn ṣe ni a tun nilo.
It's not in.	Ko si ninu.
Please come this way.	Jọwọ wa ni ọna yii.
There are some amazing news here.	Awọn iroyin iyalẹnu kan wa nibi.
She was afraid of him.	O bẹru rẹ.
How we deal with that is very important.	Bawo ni a ṣe ṣe pẹlu iyẹn ṣe pataki pupọ.
The last two are the first to return to you.	Awọn meji ti o kẹhin ni akọkọ lati pada si ọdọ rẹ.
There are a lot of great players.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹrọ orin nla wa.
He quickly took the books.	O yara ya awọn iwe naa.
Only for me.	Fun mi nikan ni.
It takes it all back.	O gba gbogbo rẹ pada.
I love to find ideas.	Mo nifẹ lati wa awọn imọran.
Take a minute, do you?	Gba iṣẹju kan, ṣe iwọ?
I have known you forever.	Mo ti mọ ọ lailai.
I love when people have their own sense of humor.	Mo nifẹ nigbati awọn eniyan ba ni ori ti ara wọn.
You could say it could be better.	O le sọ pe o le dara julọ.
But there is still a long way to go.	Ṣugbọn ọna pipẹ tun wa lati lọ.
You wash the day before you do.	O wẹ ọjọ ṣaaju ki o to ṣe.
And it is similar.	Ati pe o jẹ iru.
They will not work in one group.	Wọn kii yoo ṣiṣẹ ni ẹgbẹ kan.
History books are my favorite.	Iwe itan jẹ ayanfẹ mi.
Prior to this test, little was known about the weather.	Ṣaaju idanwo yii, diẹ ni a mọ nipa oju ojo.
It’s also a good run.	O tun jẹ ṣiṣe ti o dara.
It has more value for us all that way.	O ni iye diẹ sii fun wa ni gbogbo ọna yẹn.
I heard a voice, but nothing else.	Mo gbọ ohun, ṣugbọn ko si ohun miiran.
He knocked out violently.	O si lu jade ni agbara.
Speaking the truth.	Ti n sọ otitọ.
It was probably something to do with it.	O je jasi nkankan lati se pẹlu rẹ.
We will of course return !.	A yoo dajudaju pada!.
For someone to seek help.	Fun ẹnikan lati wa iranlọwọ.
Our dogs will help carry something.	Awọn aja wa yoo ṣe iranlọwọ lati gbe nkan.
You get it here at some point.	O gba u nibi ni akoko kan.
We love it here better.	A nifẹ rẹ nibi dara.
We spent all day on the beach.	A lo gbogbo ọjọ lori eti okun.
The garden is very beautiful.	Awọn ọgba jẹ gidigidi lẹwa.
I count the days until your birthday.	Mo ka awọn ọjọ titi di ọjọ ibi rẹ.
Caught and has no idea why.	Ti mu ati pe ko ni imọran idi.
My husband is also here.	Ọkọ mi tun wa nibi.
That is an idea.	Iyẹn jẹ ero kan.
You will not leave.	Iwọ kii yoo lọ kuro.
It’s not just an art gallery.	Kii ṣe ile aworan nikan.
You can see why.	O le rii idi.
The cat jumped down from that tree.	Ologbo naa fo si isalẹ lati ori igi yẹn.
To know you are here.	Lati mọ pe o wa nibi.
More women working outside the home than ever before.	Awọn obinrin diẹ sii ṣiṣẹ ni ita ile ju ti tẹlẹ lọ.
Most people know a little about your home life.	Pupọ eniyan mọ kekere kan nipa ile aye ile rẹ.
There is little water there.	Omi kekere wa nibẹ.
We are very worried.	A ṣe aniyan pupọ.
Nothing will happen to me.	Ko si ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ si mi.
I'm waiting.	Mo n duro de.
We try to keep it simple.	A gbiyanju lati jẹ ki o rọrun.
That's probably what always happens.	Ti o ni jasi ohun ti nigbagbogbo ṣẹlẹ.
The driver is available.	Awakọ naa wa.
The morning was amazing.	Owurọ jẹ iyanu.
Or even think about them.	Tabi paapaa ronu nipa wọn.
But it is very important to keep up with the times.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe pataki pupọ lati tẹsiwaju pẹlu awọn akoko.
Even her mother is dead.	Paapaa iya rẹ ti ku.
Gives your word.	Yoo fun ọrọ rẹ.
His father did not hear or change.	Baba rẹ ko gbọ tabi yipada.
Obviously this does not work.	O han ni eyi ko ṣiṣẹ.
Now carried out.	Bayi ti gbe jade.
It does whatever.	O ṣe ohunkohun ti.
She is worried about it.	O ni aniyan nipa rẹ.
This is the person.	Eyi ni eniyan naa.
I'm trying to help.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ran.
Not so good.	Ko ki dara.
The food went well.	Ounjẹ naa lọ daradara.
I can pay a lot of money for this.	Mo le san owo pupọ fun eyi.
And right.	O si tọ.
Everything is new, and it’s all very surprising.	Ohun gbogbo jẹ tuntun, ati pe gbogbo rẹ ni iyalẹnu pupọ.
The sister was very nice that way.	Arabinrin naa dara pupọ ni ọna yẹn.
You know, one of those stories.	O mọ, ọkan ninu awọn itan yẹn.
The sister was incredibly beautiful and incredibly small.	Arabinrin naa lẹwa ti iyalẹnu ati kekere ti iyalẹnu.
I need to do something.	Mo nilo lati se nkankan.
Our eyes meet.	Oju wa pade.
You look at them.	O wo wọn.
It has been great.	O ti jẹ nla.
Another two years could end it.	Ọdun meji miiran kan le pari rẹ.
That seems obvious to me.	Iyẹn dabi gbangba fun mi.
Wait, wait.	Duro, duro.
Maybe it happened in some other world out in space.	Boya o ṣẹlẹ ni diẹ ninu awọn miiran aye jade ni aaye kun.
My hand stopped.	Ọwọ mi duro.
You don’t always have to bring everything into.	O ko nigbagbogbo ni lati mu ohun gbogbo sinu.
This tree grows only at night.	Igi yii n dagba nikan ni alẹ.
I always listen to your music.	Mo nigbagbogbo gbọ orin rẹ.
He learned art because he loved big pictures.	O kọ ẹkọ aworan nitori pe o nifẹ awọn aworan nla.
I don’t think it matters.	Emi ko ro pe o ṣe pataki.
They are dropped.	Ti gbe wọn silẹ.
You will need to lock the first information before you can run another.	Iwọ yoo nilo lati tii alaye akọkọ ṣaaju ki o to le ṣiṣẹ miiran.
I made my way back to my little guy when he did.	Mo ṣe pada si ọdọ eniyan kekere mi nigbati o ṣe.
First, the test is still available for the future.	Ni akọkọ, idanwo naa tun wa fun ọjọ iwaju.
And they can come with only about three times.	Ati pe wọn le wa pẹlu bii igba mẹta nikan.
That is, you can if you have the world to.	Iyẹn ni, o le ti o ba ni aye lati.
Such value is long.	Iru iye jẹ gun.
I have heard a lot about it.	Mo ti gbọ pupọ nipa rẹ.
Much of his work is.	Pupọ julọ iṣẹ rẹ jẹ.
Few people know the city.	Awọn eniyan diẹ ni o mọ ilu naa.
Obviously.	O han gbangba.
We knew it at the time.	A mọ rẹ ni akoko.
Make yourself at home.	Ṣe ara rẹ ni ile.
He asked questions to get information.	O beere awọn ibeere lati gba alaye.
It happened to me, especially.	O ṣẹlẹ si mi, paapaa.
Love it or leave it.	Nifẹ rẹ tabi fi silẹ.
I know we have been beaten down.	Mo mọ pe a ti lu isalẹ.
I am very happy to see him.	Inu mi dun pupo lati ri i.
All three wore the same outfit.	Gbogbo awọn mẹta ti wọ aṣọ kanna.
I am not so sure.	Emi ko da mi loju bẹ.
Or that it does not exist.	Tabi pe ko si.
I almost became a mother.	Mo ti fẹrẹ di iya.
My game face.	Oju ere mi.
That’s there to see.	Iyẹn wa lati rii.
It can come up in three ways.	O le wa si oke ni ọna mẹta.
To his men.	Si awọn ọkunrin rẹ.
It must be taken away.	O gbọdọ ya kuro.
Get hungry.	Gba ebi.
Make no mistake, child.	Maṣe ṣe aṣiṣe, ọmọ.
At least, it doesn’t work everywhere.	O kere ju, ko ṣiṣẹ nibi gbogbo.
There is nothing to do.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣe.
It happens every several years.	O ṣẹlẹ ni gbogbo ọdun pupọ.
Eat the weather.	Je oju ojo.
They need to be.	Wọn nilo lati jẹ.
It's eye-catching.	O jẹ oju lati rii.
Therefore, in other words,	Nitorina, ni awọn ọrọ miiran,
Sure we do.	Daju pe a ṣe.
This is really amazing.	Eyi jẹ iyanu gaan.
Not for your child or family.	Kii ṣe fun ọmọ rẹ tabi idile rẹ.
Here they live.	Nibi ti won gbe.
They are more light.	Wọn jẹ ina diẹ sii.
This is news for me.	Eyi jẹ iroyin fun mi.
Husband and wife have it all.	Ọkọ ati iyawo ni o ni gbogbo rẹ.
I should be able to pull some strings.	Mo yẹ ki o ni anfani lati fa awọn okun diẹ.
It would be nice to remember that.	Yoo ṣe daradara lati ranti iyẹn.
He ran as fast as he could.	O si sare bi o ti le.
I knew in my heart that we should stay home.	Mo mọ ninu ọkan mi pe a yẹ ki o duro si ile.
For you.	Fun e.
But, no, they are not out here.	Ṣugbọn, rara, wọn ko jade nibi.
This is not time or space.	Eyi kii ṣe akoko tabi aaye.
And many times, he killed them.	Ati ni ọpọlọpọ igba, o pa wọn.
But it can't.	Ṣugbọn ko le.
How much.	Elo ni.
It doesn't hurt anymore.	Ko ṣe ipalara mọ.
Her friends love her and love to pop out.	Awọn ọrẹ rẹ fẹran rẹ ati nifẹ lati gbe jade.
The tree stays with them.	Igi naa duro pẹlu wọn.
Okay, but if you change your mind forever.	O dara, ṣugbọn ti o ba yipada ọkan rẹ lailai.
He was still a man.	O si tun ọkunrin kan.
Do not wash your hands in hot water.	Ma wẹ ọwọ rẹ ninu omi gbona.
You maybe learn to play.	Iwọ boya kọ ẹkọ lati mu.
He’s a doctor, good.	O jẹ dokita, ti o dara.
He didn't say a word, just held it until it was over.	Ko sọ ọrọ kan rara, o kan mu u titi o fi pari.
You may be there for a while.	O le wa nibẹ fun igba diẹ.
It sounds like a great job.	O dabi iṣẹ nla kan.
His eyes first went to his brother and then to me.	Oju rẹ akọkọ lọ si arakunrin rẹ ati ki o si mi.
Okay, everything is fine, but we should not have too much rest.	O dara, ohun gbogbo dara, ṣugbọn a ko gbọdọ ni isinmi pupọ.
She is doing well.	O n ṣe daradara.
He asked me to stay inside the restaurant.	O beere fun mi lati duro si inu ile ounjẹ naa.
They are what they are.	Wọn jẹ ohun ti wọn jẹ.
And it is for men, too.	Ati ki o jẹ fun awọn ọkunrin, ju.
I just need someone here for me.	Mo kan nilo ẹnikan nibi fun mi.
You are too old to leave on your own.	O ti dagba ju lati fi silẹ funrararẹ.
Things you will include, if you can.	Awọn nkan ti iwọ yoo pẹlu, ti o ba le.
It’s a great program, it works.	O jẹ eto nla, o ṣiṣẹ.
That is very young.	Ọmọde pupọ ni iyẹn.
Clean people are smart.	Awọn eniyan ti o mọ ni ọgbọn.
I want to know.	Mo fẹ lati mọ.
Without it the work can not be completed.	Laisi rẹ iṣẹ ko le pari.
So it seems.	Nitorina o dabi.
I have a boat, of course.	Mo ni ọkọ oju omi, dajudaju.
We would talk for hours and hours.	A yoo sọrọ fun awọn wakati ati awọn wakati.
We won a game.	A gba ere kan.
Maybe it’s a key to what you need to do.	Boya o jẹ bọtini kan si ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe.
Nothing, at least.	Nkankan, o kere ju.
They need to think again.	Wọn nilo lati ronu lẹẹkansi.
Here is what it looks like.	Eyi ni ohun ti o dabi.
He said it was over in a minute.	O sọ pe o ti pari ni iṣẹju kan.
You never knew him.	Iwọ ko tii mọ ọ rara.
Of course it would have tired me already.	Dajudaju yoo ti rẹ mi tẹlẹ.
Things are not always what they seem.	Awọn nkan kii ṣe nigbagbogbo ohun ti wọn dabi.
It will not stop.	Ko ni duro.
And it really works.	Ati pe o ṣiṣẹ gaan.
Wash your clothes in warm water rather than hot.	Fọ aṣọ rẹ ni omi gbona ju ki o gbona.
Do you want to explain that a little bit.	Ṣe o fẹ lati ṣe alaye iyẹn diẹ diẹ.
I am home now.	Mo wa ile bayi.
There are no seats available.	Ko si awọn ijoko ti o wa.
If you are convinced.	Ti o ba ni idaniloju.
The rules are simple.	Awọn ofin wa rọrun.
Or there is another simple way.	Tabi ọna ti o rọrun miiran wa.
I, with the highest hand, do not.	Emi, pẹlu ọwọ ti o ga julọ, kii ṣe.
I don’t see what else you could have done.	Emi ko rii kini ohun miiran ti o le ti ṣe.
It is not educational.	Ko ṣe ẹkọ.
And if we want to go, we must do so soon.	Ati pe ti a ba fẹ lọ, a gbọdọ ṣe bẹ laipẹ.
Here is what will happen.	Eyi ni ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
The picture doesn't really sound like that.	Aworan naa ko dun gaan bi iru bẹẹ.
That is completely wrong.	Iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe patapata.
But not really.	Sugbon ko gan.
What did you do with the test?	Kini o ṣe ti idanwo naa?
And they like to tell them they’re right.	Ati pe wọn fẹran lati sọ fun wọn pe wọn tọ.
It’s not about money.	Kii ṣe nipa owo.
We will not return home.	A o pada si ile mi.
In the morning, he said.	Ni owurọ, o sọ.
Pull the seat up.	Fa ijoko soke.
Our work is not done.	Iṣẹ wa ko ṣe.
I would think about it.	Emi yoo ronu nipa rẹ.
How the woman is doing, she wonders.	Bawo ni obinrin naa ṣe n ṣe, o ṣe iyalẹnu.
But it was the right thing to do.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ohun ti o tọ lati ṣe.
But he knew he would not.	Ṣugbọn o mọ pe oun yoo ko.
I didn’t see that last time.	Emi ko rii iyẹn ni akoko to kẹhin.
There are other reasons as well.	Awọn idi miiran tun wa.
Why is this person talking louder than everyone else?	Kini idi ti eniyan yii n sọrọ ga ju gbogbo eniyan miiran lọ?
You should buy legs.	O yẹ ki o ra awọn ẹsẹ.
People are not happy.	Inu awon eniyan ko dun.
The food has a lot of delicious flavors.	Ounjẹ naa ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ounjẹ ti o dun.
I love my mother.	Mo feran iya mi.
Tell him everything is going well here.	Sọ fun u pe ohun gbogbo n lọ daradara nibi.
Everyone at the table seemed to be looking at me.	Gbogbo eniyan ti o wa ni tabili dabi ẹni pe wọn n wo mi.
And this is important.	Ati pe eyi ṣe pataki.
They have been in it.	Wọn ti jẹ ninu rẹ.
We have a lot of books at home.	A ni ọpọlọpọ awọn iwe ni ile.
I can't touch the bottom.	Mi o le fi ọwọ kan isalẹ.
You may not like it.	O le ma fẹran rẹ.
You are trying not to die, and you are the last person in the world.	O n gbiyanju lati ma ku, ati pe iwọ ni eniyan ikẹhin ni aye.
We all want to leave.	Gbogbo wa fẹ lati lọ kuro.
We are anxious.	A ni aniyan.
It's simple and easy to make.	O rọrun ati rọrun lati ṣe.
This can go both ways, especially.	Eyi le lọ awọn ọna mejeeji, paapaa.
To speed up the game, of course, so it doesn’t mean anything.	Lati yara ere, dajudaju, nitorina ko tumọ si nkankan.
Thought it was the same.	Ti ro pe o jẹ kanna.
I am not a police officer.	Emi kii ṣe ọlọpa.
I sat down for a minute.	Mo joko jẹ fun iṣẹju kan.
Now they have.	Bayi wọn ti ni.
Throughout the city, people are either on the couch, or will be there soon.	Ni gbogbo ilu, eniyan wa boya lori ibusun, tabi yoo wa laipẹ.
Sometimes very difficult things.	Nigba miiran awọn nkan ti o nira pupọ.
What follows is.	Ohun ti o wa lẹhin ni.
I usually paint them.	Mo maa kun wọn.
This is important.	Eyi ṣe pataki.
It worked for me.	O ṣiṣẹ fun mi.
I, of course, above all.	Emi, dajudaju, ju gbogbo eyi lọ.
I don’t think about it like that.	Emi ko ronu nipa rẹ bi iyẹn.
You know there are many ways.	O mọ pe awọn ọna pupọ wa.
Only through more games will it be easier.	Nikan nipasẹ awọn ere diẹ sii yoo rọrun.
I write this for two reasons.	Mo kọ eyi fun idi meji.
It is a good question to think about.	O jẹ ibeere ti o dara lati ronu.
Make sure you don’t miss it !.	Rii daju pe ko padanu rẹ!.
The decision is not appropriate in every way.	Ipinnu naa ko yẹ ni gbogbo ọna.
We have been on the edge for too long.	A ti wa lori eti fun gun ju.
It's coming.	O n bọ lọwọ.
Is anything stolen?	Njẹ ohunkohun ti a ji?
Just wait a little longer.	Kan duro diẹ diẹ.
A le yara.	A le yara.
Another student spoke.	Ọmọ ile-iwe miiran sọrọ.
But she found out she wanted to give him a test question.	Ṣugbọn o rii pe o fẹ fun u ni ibeere idanwo kan.
He tried to reach them with his heart.	O gbiyanju lati de ọdọ wọn pẹlu ọkan rẹ.
You have a good life up there.	O ni kan ti o dara aye soke nibẹ.
Everyone should have that opportunity.	Gbogbo eniyan gbọdọ ni anfani yẹn.
The others sat down with him and talked.	Awọn miiran joko pẹlu rẹ ati sọrọ.
Do we need to contact a doctor?	Ṣe a nilo lati kan si dokita?
It does not seem so.	Ko dabi bẹ.
He thought he understood everything.	O ro pe ohun gbogbo loye.
They are wrong.	Wọn jẹ aṣiṣe.
It’s not like a tree test.	Ko dabi idanwo igi.
Home has that space in your head.	Ile ni aaye yẹn ninu ori rẹ.
The police came with two side cars.	Awọn ọlọpa wa pẹlu awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ẹgbẹ meji.
And it doesn’t even matter.	Ati pe ko ṣe akiyesi paapaa.
You can’t even think to go through this alone.	O ko le paapaa ronu lati lọ nipasẹ eyi nikan.
It doesn't matter who.	Ko ṣe pataki tani.
The sun is yet to rise.	Oorun ni sibẹsibẹ lati dide.
All, but one that is.	Gbogbo, ṣugbọn ọkan ti o jẹ.
You know why he was there.	O mọ idi ti o fi wa nibẹ.
We left ourselves to continue on foot.	A fi ara wa silẹ lati tẹsiwaju ni ẹsẹ.
Can you remember those letters?	Ṣe o le ranti awọn lẹta yẹn?
The children decided they had to do something to help.	Awọn ọmọde pinnu pe wọn ni lati ṣe ohun kan lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
Others just walked away.	Awọn miiran kan rin kuro.
Does not accept names.	Ko gba awọn orukọ.
But without it, it’s not very good.	Ṣugbọn laisi rẹ, ko dara julọ.
He often worked long hours in the office.	Nigbagbogbo o ṣiṣẹ awọn wakati pipẹ ni ọfiisi.
I wonder what he wants from me this time, he thought.	Mo Iyanu ohun ti o fe lati mi akoko yi, o ro.
He is very worried about the girl.	O ni aniyan pupọ nipa ọmọbirin naa.
You should get the money and just.	O yẹ ki o gba owo naa ati pe o kan.
They will be very afraid.	Wọn yoo bẹru pupọ.
Other things also changed.	Awọn nkan miiran tun yipada.
We will update them soon.	A yoo mu wọn laipẹ.
We waited for hours, not sure if it had arrived.	A duro fun awọn wakati, ko rii daju boya o ti de.
He would not be a man if that were the case.	Oun kii yoo jẹ ọkunrin ti o ba iyẹn jẹ.
This convinced me.	Eyi da mi loju.
We’re running out of time.	A n sare ti akoko.
I can handle this.	Mo le mu eyi.
Music.	Orin.
Some did not come home.	Diẹ ninu awọn ko wa si ile.
Did you know that there are many types of tea?	Njẹ o mọ pe ọpọlọpọ iru tii lo wa?
It is a small town.	Ilu kekere ni.
It is better not to think now.	O dara julọ lati ma ronu ni bayi.
I can't come back to your house anymore.	Nko le pada wa si ile re mo.
Listen, get me involved with this.	Gbọ, gba mi lọwọ pẹlu eyi.
However this is the only thing we do.	Sibẹsibẹ eyi jẹ ohun ti a ṣe nikan.
Everything they have has been left behind.	Gbogbo ohun ti wọn ni ni a ti fi silẹ.
You have given bad hair!	O ti fun ni irun buburu!
These roads will go the way of the road.	Awọn ọna wọnyi yoo lọ si ọna opopona naa.
For a long time he was in that position.	Fun igba pipẹ o wa ni ipo yẹn.
I just think it is amazing.	Mo kan ro pe o jẹ iyalẹnu.
Both work well.	Mejeeji ṣiṣẹ daradara.
But it has happened.	Ṣugbọn o ti ṣẹlẹ.
That went great.	Ti o lọ nla.
And this always works well enough.	Ati pe eyi nigbagbogbo ṣiṣẹ daradara to.
Very hot weather.	Oju ojo gbona pupọ.
I have seen two things that can cause this.	Mo ti ri meji ohun ti o le fa yi.
Look me in the eye.	Wo mi ni oju mi.
We need to be able to listen.	A nilo lati ni anfani lati gbọ.
People need to know.	Eniyan nilo lati mọ.
I want to keep them one way or another.	Mo fẹ lati tọju wọn ni ọna kan.
It will be for doing the right thing.	Yoo jẹ fun ṣiṣe ohun ti o tọ.
Or see for yourself.	Tabi wo fun ara rẹ.
The boy found the trip enjoyable.	Ọmọkunrin naa ri irin-ajo naa ti o dun.
See below river.	Wo isalẹ odo.
Do you really need it? 	Ṣe o nilo rẹ gaan?
he asked.	o beere.
You are beaten.	O ti wa ni lu.
The first lesson, don’t look up or down.	Ẹkọ akọkọ, maṣe wo kuro tabi isalẹ.
I see you do.	Mo rii pe o ṣe.
I don’t know how it came to be that name.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe wa ni orukọ yẹn.
Years may pass before you have a company.	Awọn ọdun le kọja ṣaaju ki o ni ile-iṣẹ.
He told me to get up.	O so fun mi lati dide.
It starts here.	O bẹrẹ nibi.
He is at home.	O wa ni ile.
There are.	Nibẹ ni o wa.
I love to walk, especially with my dogs.	Mo nifẹ lati rin, paapaa pẹlu awọn aja mi.
It will not be me.	Kii yoo jẹ emi.
Look at the people we know.	Wo awọn eniyan ti a mọ.
But he sold it to his team.	Ṣugbọn o ta fun ẹgbẹ rẹ.
I have no.	Mo ni rara.
It was beautiful even that night.	O lẹwa paapaa ni alẹ yẹn.
I don't want to do family law.	Nko fe se ofin idile.
They are very happy with each other.	Inu wọn dun pupọ si ara wọn.
I may not understand it.	Mo le ma loye rẹ.
Nothing killed them.	Ko si ohun ti o pa wọn.
Both returned an item.	Awọn mejeeji da ohun kan pada.
Everyone has to eat.	Gbogbo eniyan ni lati jẹun.
Not on it.	Ko wa lori rẹ.
You did not meet my face.	O ko pade oju mi.
You treat it that way.	O tọju rẹ ni ọna yẹn.
You’ve seen them at the restaurant.	O ti rii wọn ni ile ounjẹ naa.
I can see them doing it.	Mo ti le ri wọn ṣe o.
This is too fast.	Eyi yara ju.
He said he did.	O sọ pe o ṣe.
But we do not live in such a world.	Sugbon a ko gbe ni iru kan aye.
I do not know how to change it.	Emi ko mo bi o lati yi o.
I also see that a lot.	Mo tun rii iyẹn pupọ.
No heat problems now.	Ko si awọn iṣoro ooru bayi.
I wonder why they are not married, maybe there is something wrong with them.	Mo Iyanu idi ti won ko ba wa ni iyawo, boya nibẹ ni nkankan ti ko tọ si pẹlu wọn.
You see life as a game.	O wo igbesi aye bi ere.
We are not in the same program.	A ko wa ninu eto kanna.
Or find such a group in your area.	Tabi wa iru ẹgbẹ kan ni agbegbe rẹ.
The price may go up.	Iye owo naa le lọ soke.
Okay, it doesn't matter now.	O dara, ko ṣe pataki ni bayi.
No one has used that word yet.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o lo ọrọ yẹn sibẹsibẹ.
But, more needs to be done.	Ṣugbọn, diẹ sii nilo lati ṣee.
See that.	Wo iyẹn.
That's what some people do.	Bẹẹ ni awọn eniyan kan ṣe.
That we can be friends.	Pe a le jẹ ọrẹ.
People heard her story and wanted to help.	Eniyan gbọ rẹ itan ati ki o fe lati ran.
Doctors are trying to get the boy back.	Awọn dokita n gbiyanju lati gba ọmọkunrin naa pada.
Well known music and artistic celebration.	Orin ti a mọ daradara ati ayẹyẹ iṣẹ ọna.
They seem to come from another world.	Wọn dabi ẹni pe wọn wa lati aye miiran.
But not much.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ.
History is important.	Itan ṣe pataki.
Both are worse than anything we have ever seen.	Awọn mejeeji jẹ buburu ju ohunkohun ti a ti rii lọ.
Maybe they’ll find that they can’t.	Boya wọn yoo rii pe wọn ko le ṣe.
The first thing tomorrow.	Ohun akọkọ ọla.
She seemed upset.	O dabi enipe inu bi o.
I need energy for other things.	Mo nilo agbara fun awọn nkan miiran.
Are you married, you wonder.	Ṣe o ni iyawo, o ṣe iyalẹnu.
Love, love, love.	Awọn ifẹ, ifẹ, nifẹ.
The service was just as bad.	Awọn iṣẹ je o kan bi buburu.
And sometimes it works.	Ati nigba miiran o ṣiṣẹ.
Why is it passing by at all.	Kini idi ti o fi n kọja rara.
There was no one to help him.	Ko si ẹnikan lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun u.
Neither is concerned with clothing.	Bẹni ko ni aniyan pẹlu aṣọ.
But it has big problems.	Ṣugbọn o ni awọn iṣoro nla.
I don't need a house like this.	Emi ko nilo ile bi eleyi.
Either that or the housework.	Boya iyẹn tabi iṣẹ ile ni.
We have to change that.	A ni lati yi iyẹn pada.
You will not hide any.	Iwọ kii yoo tọju eyikeyi.
I have to try.	Mo ni lati gbiyanju.
It could be something else.	O le jẹ nkan miiran.
This is not a good thing, this should not happen.	Eyi kii ṣe ohun ti o dara, eyi ko yẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
Just find a place to hide.	O kan wa aaye lati tọju.
He did not think about the question for a while.	O ko ronu ibeere naa fun igba diẹ.

I went into the city.	Mo lọ sinu ilu naa.
You need something, talk to me.	O nilo nkankan, sọrọ si mi.
That does not count.	Iyẹn ko ka.
In the last few days his condition has become serious.	Ni awọn ọjọ diẹ sẹhin ipo rẹ ti di pataki.
It was completely run by the players.	Ti o ti patapata ṣiṣe nipasẹ awọn ẹrọ orin.
You may be wrong about that.	O le jẹ aṣiṣe nipa iyẹn.
Too late.	O ti pẹ ju.
Her parents are both teachers.	Awọn obi rẹ jẹ olukọ mejeeji.
He seemed to enjoy the store a lot.	O dabi enipe o gbadun ile itaja naa pupọ.
If you think you will be better off, so will you.	Ti o ba ro pe iwọ yoo dara julọ, bẹ iwọ yoo.
I will never forget it.	Emi yoo ko gbagbe rẹ.
They spend summers at the beach.	Wọn lo awọn igba ooru ni eti okun.
It's too hot here!	O gbona ju nibi!
This time he will believe, perhaps.	Ni akoko yii oun yoo gbagbọ, boya.
Not high is important.	Ko ga ni pataki.
It was amazing to me.	O jẹ iyanu fun mi.
But they don’t like to think about that.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko nifẹ lati ronu nipa iyẹn.
I don't see why.	Emi ko ri idi ti ko.
One can continue.	Ọkan le tẹsiwaju.
That’s long in the past.	Iyẹn gun ni igba atijọ.
Who wrote this letter?	Tani o kọ lẹta yii?
Our room is just that.	Yara wa gan ti o kan.
I notice we are in a way.	Mo ṣe akiyesi pe a wa ni ọna kan.
You just know you have to try.	O mọ nikan pe o ni lati gbiyanju.
Back to you.	Pada si ọ.
Obviously, they have not changed much.	O han ni, wọn ko ti yipada pupọ.
Pull out and clean.	Fa jade ki o si mọ.
They went without a hitch.	Wọn lọ laisi wahala.
But life, of course, is not real.	Ṣugbọn igbesi aye, dajudaju, kii ṣe awọn otitọ.
It looks interesting.	O dabi awon.
To be in love.	Lati wa ninu ife.
For two more years.	Fun ọdun meji diẹ sii.

But not the door, either.	Ṣugbọn ko ti ilẹkun, boya.
Clock.	Aago.
She was anxious to learn.	O ṣe aniyan lati kọ ẹkọ.

One or two still eat.	Ọkan tabi meji ṣi jẹun.
The very one.	Awọn gan ọkan.
He was sitting in his car.	O joko ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ.
So, he kissed the best thing.	Nitorina, o fi ẹnu ko ohun ti o dara julọ.
I feel like home.	Mo ri bi ile.
It helps to get new ideas.	O ṣe iranlọwọ lati gba awọn imọran tuntun.

It is an explanation of what happened.	O jẹ alaye ti nkan ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Ask for any that may happen while you are here.	Beere fun eyikeyi ti o le ṣẹlẹ nigba ti o ba wa nibi.
It takes a long, long time.	O gba pipẹ, akoko pipẹ.
He just grabbed her, and hit her hair.	O kan mu u, o si n lu irun rẹ.
The city also operates a bus system.	Ilu naa tun n ṣiṣẹ eto ọkọ akero kan.
It is for you.	O wa fun ọ.
The question has been asked.	A ti beere ibeere naa.
Her brother is gone.	Arakunrin rẹ ti lọ.
Or maybe don’t test it at all.	Tabi boya ma ṣe idanwo naa rara.
They are decisions you have no control over.	Wọn jẹ awọn ipinnu ti o ko ni ọwọ ninu.
Must mean you do it on time.	Gbọdọ tumọ si pe o ṣe ni akoko.
It is a long way to travel for a few people.	O jẹ ọna pipẹ lati rin irin-ajo fun awọn eniyan diẹ.
It will not be available for days.	Kii yoo wa fun awọn ọjọ.
But not when you are on duty.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe nigba ti o wa lori iṣẹ.
Time is a good thing to give a friend.	Akoko jẹ ohun ti o dara lati fun ọrẹ kan.
But you can help me if you can tell me more.	Ṣugbọn o le ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi ti o ba le sọ fun mi diẹ sii.
But there is a place.	Sugbon ibi kan wa.
Can't think of a reason to do so.	Ko le ronu idi kan ti yoo ṣe.
You don't even find them interesting, not really.	O ko paapaa ri wọn awon, ko gan.
We have heard them.	A ti gbọ wọn.
It does not mean.	Ko tumọ si.
That is not a question at all.	Iyẹn ko jẹ ibeere rara.
You did not finish your meal.	O ko pari ounjẹ rẹ.
I was a little scared, but one said not to kill me.	Mo bẹru diẹ, ṣugbọn ọkan sọ pe ki o ma pa mi.
They need it for their lives.	Wọn nilo rẹ fun igbesi aye wọn.
And this time he will notice.	Ati ni akoko yii oun yoo ṣe akiyesi.
Of course, this is nothing new.	Dajudaju, eyi kii ṣe nkan tuntun.
There is more to it than sight.	Nibẹ ni diẹ si o ju oju.
It is high and good.	O ga ati pe o dara.
Many companies have adopted an unlicensed program.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile-iṣẹ ti gba eto ti ko ni iwe.
Until that night.	Titi di alẹ yẹn.
Just let me eat.	O kan jẹ ki mi jẹ.
I can't wait to see what comes next to buy.	Emi ko le duro lati wo ohun ti o wa lati ra.
Any team under the same conditions would have done such a thing.	Ẹgbẹ eyikeyi labẹ awọn ipo kanna yoo ti ṣe iru nkan kan.
It is important.	O jẹ pataki.
That is your brother's name.	Orukọ arakunrin rẹ niyẹn.
He wondered if he would notice something.	O ṣe iyalẹnu boya oun yoo ṣe akiyesi nkan kan.
The sister must have hurt herself, she thought.	Arabinrin naa gbọdọ ti ṣe ipalara fun ararẹ, o ro.
Your body is gone.	Ara rẹ ti lọ.
Opportunities extend across the entire community.	Awọn anfani fa kọja gbogbo agbegbe.
Work while you wait.	Ṣiṣẹ nigba ti o duro.
They don’t even have shoes on.	Wọn ko paapaa ni bata lori.
He has been working in his home office.	O ti n ṣiṣẹ ni ọfiisi ile rẹ.
I just don’t think they get it.	Mo kan ko ro pe wọn gba.
I hope they will.	Mo nireti pe wọn yoo fẹ.
Children's games are fun.	Awọn ere ti awọn ọmọde ni ere.
Well, you must not miss a meal.	O dara, o ko gbọdọ padanu ounjẹ.
Knowing about them and their benefits is great.	Mọ nipa wọn ati awọn anfani wọn jẹ nla.
Is it enough to eat today?	Ṣe o ni to lati jẹ loni?
There are several ways this can happen.	Awọn ọna pupọ lo wa ti eyi le ṣẹlẹ.
Your family is just getting better because they are so happy to be home.	Idile rẹ n kan dara nitori wọn dun pupọ pe o wa ni ile.
It may be on its way here now.	O le wa ni ọna rẹ nibi bayi.
So let’s do it.	Nitorina jẹ ki a ṣe.
But you missed out, great time.	Ṣugbọn o padanu, akoko nla.
They did what they did and we did what we did.	Wọn ṣe ohun ti wọn ṣe ati pe a ṣe ohun ti a ṣe.
I want to forget it, but it stays with me.	Mo fẹ lati gbagbe rẹ, ṣugbọn o duro pẹlu mi.
It takes some time, but it is very easy to do.	O gba akoko diẹ, ṣugbọn o rọrun pupọ lati ṣe.
You can stay here only for two hours.	O le duro si ibi nikan fun wakati meji.
We all have to accept your word for what happened.	Gbogbo wa ni lati gba ọrọ rẹ fun ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
We keep it up.	A tọju rẹ soke.
It has not yet worked on it.	Ko ṣe sibẹsibẹ ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ.
Here he tells us about how he went about it.	Nibi ti o sọ fun wa nipa bi o ti lọ nipa rẹ.
Got to see it, myself.	Ti lọ lati ri i, ara mi.
The ancient city of history is beautiful.	Ilu atijọ ti itan jẹ lẹwa.
It doesn't work either.	Ko ṣiṣẹ boya.
We will of course make plans to return.	A yoo dajudaju ṣe awọn ero lati pada.
So what will you eat for breakfast?	Nitorina kini iwọ yoo jẹ fun ounjẹ owurọ?
No, he did not use my name.	Rara, ko lo orukọ mi.
But there are many other things that can be done.	Ṣugbọn ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun miiran wa ti o le ṣee ṣe.
In that car.	Ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yẹn.
He is the one who told the story.	Oun ni o sọ itan naa.
This can be done.	Eyi le ṣee ṣiṣẹ.
You need to open it.	O nilo lati ṣii.
You have heard the stories.	O ti gbọ awọn itan.
But my love is there.	Ṣugbọn ifẹ mi wa nibẹ.
This has not happened.	Eyi ko ti ṣẹlẹ.
I move back and forth for just about anything.	Mo n gbe pada ati isalẹ fun o kan nipa ohunkohun.

He talked to people.	O sọrọ si awọn eniyan.
He could not reach her.	Ko le de ọdọ rẹ.
We hope to see you again next time.	A nireti lati wa lẹẹkansi ni akoko miiran.
Not until you tell him.	Ko titi o fi sọ fun u.
That is enough, if you are looking for a reason.	Iyẹn jẹ idi to, ti o ba n wa idi kan.
Only your eyes.	Oju rẹ nikan.
I could not do without him.	Emi ko le ṣe laisi rẹ.
They did not stay long.	Wọn ko duro pẹ.
I talk friend to friend.	Mo sọrọ ọrẹ si ọrẹ.
Learn the keys.	Kọ ẹkọ awọn bọtini.
Or yet that word goes.	Tabi sibẹsibẹ ọrọ yẹn lọ.
You have to come here.	O ni lati wa si ibi.
Okay, it doesn't matter now.	O dara, ko ṣe pataki ni bayi.
That never happened.	Iyẹn ko ṣẹlẹ rara.
Nothing in either.	Ko si nkankan ninu boya.
He asked for a meeting.	O beere ipade kan.
I don't like it at all.	Emi ko fẹran rẹ rara.
Let's get it on with.	Jẹ ká gba o lori pẹlu.
Your life as life is enough.	Igbesi aye rẹ bi igbesi aye ti to.
Think of what brought us here first.	Ronu ti ohun ti o mu wa si ibi ni akọkọ.

Making money is our biggest decision.	Ṣiṣe owo jẹ ipinnu nla wa.
Here is his picture.	Eyi ni aworan rẹ.
I forgot to lock it again.	Mo ti gbagbe lati tii lẹẹkansi.
The man had grown up.	Ọkunrin naa ti dagba.
He was the only person there.	Oun nikan ni eniyan ti o wa.
I think the police are trying to get to her car.	Mo ro pe awọn ọlọpa n gbiyanju lati lọ si ọdọ ọkọ rẹ.
He did not know what to do.	Ko mọ ohun ti o fẹ ṣe.
If you can help me that would be great.	Ti o ba le ran mi lọwọ iyẹn yoo jẹ nla.
He is the only person.	Oun nikan ni eniyan.
Maybe he even gave it away.	Boya o paapaa fun ni kuro.
We have no rest.	A ko ni isinmi.
It was a car, and he lived.	O jẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan, o si n gbe.
The thing is that kids don’t stay in music programs.	Nkan naa sọ pe awọn ọmọde ko duro ni awọn eto orin.
They are very angry.	Wọn binu pupọ.
This has nothing to do with the phone.	Eyi ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu foonu naa.
But what is wrong?	Ṣugbọn aṣiṣe ni ọna wo?.
You see.	O ri.
This time, he was convinced.	Ni akoko yii, o ni idaniloju.
He did a lot of things for me.	O ṣe ọpọlọpọ nkan fun mi.
See here for information on how to use this.	Wo nibi fun alaye lori bi o ṣe le lo eyi.
It's not too late.	Ko yi pẹ.
It was now.	O je bayi.
Find out if they need anything else for their work.	Wa boya wọn nilo ohunkohun miiran fun iṣẹ wọn.
Down he will go.	Isalẹ oun yoo lọ.
That has been this week.	Iyẹn ti jẹ ọsẹ yii.
They understand now.	Wọn ni oye ni bayi.
Her mouth dropped open.	Ẹnu rẹ silẹ silẹ.
Here is something else.	Eyi ni nkan miiran.
He is dead.	O ti ku.
Everyone should die.	Gbogbo eniyan yẹ ki o ku.
Much of his life was spent near the sea.	Pupọ ninu igbesi aye rẹ ni o lo nitosi okun.
Think school pictures.	Ronu awọn aworan ile-iwe.
He made his words out of it.	O ṣe ọrọ rẹ lati inu rẹ.
You can help him write his first book here.	O le ṣe iranlọwọ fun u lati kọ iwe akọkọ rẹ nibi.
Most women spend many hours going to household chores.	Pupọ julọ awọn obinrin lo awọn wakati pupọ lati lọ si awọn iṣẹ ile.
It’s more of a question of who can find them.	O jẹ ibeere diẹ sii ti tani o le rii wọn.
I have seen that for myself.	Mo ti ri iyẹn fun ara mi.
They believe he is dead.	Wọn gbagbọ pe o ti ku.
Now, look at their hair.	Bayi, wo irun wọn.
That will do for us.	Iyẹn yoo ṣe fun wa.
That is important.	Iyẹn ṣe pataki.
They will ask you why you are looking for a job.	Wọn yoo beere lọwọ rẹ idi ti o fi n wa iṣẹ.
He has been here for many years.	O ti wa nibi fun ọdun pupọ.
It’s easy to not be around.	O rọrun lati ma wa ni ayika rẹ.
In a case.	Ni nla kan.
Just anything that interested me at the time.	O kan ohunkohun ti o nifẹ si mi ni akoko yẹn.
I don’t even know if this will reach you.	Emi ko paapaa mọ boya eyi yoo de ọdọ rẹ.
For special questions.	Fun awọn ibeere pataki.
You, and only you, can change this.	Iwọ, ati iwọ nikan, le yi eyi pada.
He shook his head at me.	O mi ori si mi.
I don’t feel that way about another man, no.	Emi ko rilara iru eyi nipa ọkunrin miiran, rara.
What will make me happy.	Ohun ti yoo mu mi dun.
Maybe it will be my last.	Boya yoo jẹ ikẹhin mi.
I want to.	Mo fẹ.
I have no place to tell him at all.	Emi ko ni aye lati sọ fun u rara.
He did this for several weeks.	O ṣe eyi ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọsẹ.
Work hard for your future.	Ṣiṣẹ lile fun ojo iwaju rẹ.
But we did not become there.	Sugbon a ko di wa nibẹ.
Use large objects or use multiple objects.	Lo awọn nkan nla tabi lo ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
Dogs are.	Awọn aja ni.
She looked at the baby.	O wo ọmọ naa.
I would love it.	Emi yoo nifẹ rẹ.
The last man will say his word before it ends.	Ọkunrin ikẹhin yoo sọ ọrọ rẹ ṣaaju ki o to pari.
I need help to play again.	Mo nilo iranlọwọ lati mu ṣiṣẹ lẹẹkansi.
Someone needed him, and we tried to get him there.	Ẹnikan nilo rẹ, ati pe a gbiyanju lati wa nibẹ fun u.
Now is not the time.	Bayi kii ṣe akoko naa.
You never know what we really are.	O ko mọ ohun ti a jẹ gaan.
However, the story continues.	Sibẹsibẹ, itan naa tẹsiwaju.
Both are in good agreement in observing the mistakes.	Awọn mejeeji wa ni adehun ti o dara ni akiyesi awọn aṣiṣe.
But he wanted them to sleep alone.	Ṣugbọn o fẹ ki wọn sun nikan.
It gives many reasons for its decision.	O fun ọpọlọpọ awọn idi fun ipinnu rẹ.
Any time it is.	Eyikeyi akoko ti o jẹ.
So there are a lot of celebrations.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ awọn ayẹyẹ wa.
I just want you to be happy, he said.	Mo kan fẹ ki inu rẹ dun, o sọ.
Here he thinks the woman is coming towards him.	Nibi o ro pe obinrin naa ti n bọ si ọdọ rẹ.
Maybe more than anyone else.	Boya diẹ sii ju ẹnikẹni miiran lọ.
So he went.	Nitorina o lọ.
The lesson is more difficult than you expected.	Ẹkọ naa nira sii ju ti o ti nireti lọ.
And you are not.	Ati pe iwọ kii ṣe.
You will have to ask him.	Iwọ yoo ni lati beere lọwọ rẹ.
You can, more.	O le, diẹ.
We often work in small groups.	Nigbagbogbo a ṣiṣẹ ni awọn ẹgbẹ kekere.
You have to know what helps cause.	O ni lati mọ ohun ti o ṣe iranlọwọ fa.
You see it happens.	O rii pe o ṣẹlẹ.
You are not one of us.	Iwọ kii ṣe ọkan ninu wa.
She was happy so she went home.	O dun nitori naa o lọ si ile.
But you need to take good care of yourself.	Ṣugbọn o nilo lati tọju ara rẹ daradara.
Ask, do not say.	Beere, maṣe sọ.
I should have done more.	Emi yẹ ki o ti ṣe diẹ sii.
I have found a rule at work in my life.	Mo ti rii ofin kan ni iṣẹ ni igbesi aye mi.
But he has no place to go now.	Ṣugbọn ko ni aye lati lọ ni bayi.
Let it be sweet, he said.	Jẹ ki o dun, o sọ.
I want to see what comes out.	Mo fe wo ohun to jade.
You want to say no.	O fẹ sọ rara.
He will let you work after all.	Oun yoo jẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ lẹhin gbogbo.
His head is down.	Ori rẹ wa ni isalẹ.
I want this marriage to work.	Mo fẹ ki igbeyawo yii ṣiṣẹ.
He will add you as a friend if you want.	Oun yoo fi ọ kun bi ọrẹ ti o ba fẹ.
I don’t mean me.	Emi ko tumọ si mi.
He looks up from the book, at him.	O wo soke lati iwe, ni i.
Now we do not do that.	Ni bayi a ko ṣe iyẹn.
People need to eat.	Eniyan nilo lati jẹun.
He saved me from my troubles.	O gba mi ninu wahala mi.
I can't make out the words.	Emi ko le ṣe jade awọn ọrọ.
He’s been back a lot lately.	O wa pada pupọ laipẹ.
Or just hoping for a good breakfast.	Tabi o kan nireti fun ounjẹ owurọ to dara.
It does.	O ṣe.
Man and garden are one.	Eniyan ati ọgba jẹ ọkan.
You can do them.	O le ṣe wọn.
Sorry, to do this but.	Ma binu, lati ṣe eyi ṣugbọn.
Many groups refuse to wear clothing.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ẹgbẹ kọ lati wọ aṣọ.
I can't keep everything.	Emi ko le tọju ohun gbogbo.
I will tell him this afternoon.	Emi yoo sọ fun u ni ọsan yii.
And don’t pretend you’re not in it.	Ati pe maṣe ṣe bi iwọ ko ni ninu rẹ.
Neither of us need to say.	Bẹni ninu wa ko nilo lati sọ.
Maybe it means something.	Boya o tumọ si nkankan.
This will be beneficial for the person.	Eyi yoo jẹ anfani fun eniyan.
Anything can change.	Ohunkohun le yipada.
Okay, let it be.	O dara, jẹ ki o jẹ.
These facts are agreed upon.	Awọn otitọ wọnyi ni adehun lori.
Not at this time.	Kii ṣe ni akoko yii.
It will not take long.	Ko ni gba to gun.
No book fees or fees.	Ko si owo iwe tabi owo.
Ask no question.	Beere ko si ibeere.
But you have to help me.	Sugbon o ni lati ran mi lọwọ.
He seemed to want someone to talk to.	O dabi enipe o fẹ ẹnikan lati sọrọ pẹlu.
Wait there can still be.	Duro nibẹ ni le si tun.
It's too late.	O pẹ ju.
My mother had already left me for sleep.	Iya mi ti fi mi silẹ tẹlẹ fun oorun.
And it can’t come together at the best of times, either.	Ati pe ko le wa papọ ni akoko ti o dara julọ, boya.
But he told my father everything.	Sugbon o so fun baba mi ohun gbogbo.
He called her, but could not reach her.	O pe e, sugbon ko le de ọdọ rẹ.
We just keep going with our lives.	A kan n tẹsiwaju pẹlu igbesi aye wa.
Write this book.	Kọ iwe yii.
This is the easiest type to use.	Eyi ni iru ti o rọrun julọ lati lo.
There was a man standing out.	Ọkunrin kan wa ti o duro jade.
You must have heard something.	O gbọdọ ti gbọ nkankan.
So now we know.	Nitorina bayi a mọ.
One makes you feel good.	Ọkan mu ki o lero ti o dara.
I could go on, but it took the place.	Mo le tẹsiwaju, ṣugbọn o gba aaye naa.
And we believe them.	Ati pe a gbagbọ wọn.
His mother and two sisters are still alive.	Iya rẹ ati awọn arabinrin meji lo wa laaye.
I closed his eyes.	Mo di oju rẹ.
We did what was possible.	A ṣe ohun ti o ṣeeṣe.
It is best to leave it alone for a while.	Dara julọ lati fi silẹ nikan fun igba diẹ.
It was very nice to take a moment to myself.	O dara pupọ lati ya akoko kan si ara mi.
Wear your clothes and go out.	Wọ aṣọ rẹ ki o jade.
He is very happy.	Inu re dun pupo.
Now you can do what you want.	Bayi o le ṣe ohun ti o fẹ.
That will have to come from me.	Iyẹn yoo ni lati wa lati ọdọ mi.
I find this to be the right place to start my career.	Mo rii pe eyi ni aaye ti o tọ lati bẹrẹ iṣẹ mi.
Some use it, what they can find it.	Diẹ ninu awọn lo o, ohun ti won le ri ti o.
But it's coming.	Sugbon o n bọ.
I'm very happy here.	Inu mi dun pupọ nibi.
Like it or not, you will die.	Bi o tabi rara, iwọ yoo ku.
They started drinking a lot.	Wọn bẹrẹ mimu pupọ.
She looks at the boy's face in the picture.	O wo oju ọmọkunrin naa ninu aworan naa.
You have your life in them.	O ni igbesi aye rẹ ninu wọn.
It was one of the most important days of their lives.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọjọ pataki julọ ti igbesi aye wọn.
You don’t really want something metal.	O ko gan fẹ nkan ti irin.
I don’t mean anything about that.	Emi ko tumọ nkankan nipa iyẹn.
I did not sleep.	Emi ko sun.
Look at that in your face.	Iyẹn wo ni oju rẹ.
This law will not change that fact.	Ofin yii kii yoo yi otitọ yẹn pada.
You let this happen.	O jẹ ki eyi ṣẹlẹ.
Don't think of me as your mother anymore.	Maṣe ro mi bi iya rẹ mọ.
They do not work at all.	Wọn ko ṣiṣẹ rara.
You may have been there.	O le ti wa nibẹ.
Is there.	O wa nibẹ.
I say you have.	Mo sọ pe o ni.
I know what you do.	Mo ti mọ ohun ti o ṣe.
I hate my name.	Mo korira orukọ mi.
We wonder about the past.	A Iyanu nipa awọn ti o ti kọja.
He said he was very good.	O sọ pe ara rẹ dara pupọ.
But injury is injury.	Ṣugbọn ipalara jẹ ipalara.
Just towards your two men.	O kan si ọna awọn ọkunrin meji rẹ.
Maybe you fear you will hurt me.	Boya o bẹru pe iwọ yoo ṣe mi ni ipalara.
People everywhere understand about them.	Awọn eniyan nibi gbogbo loye nipa wọn.
And there it is.	Ati pe o wa.
We can help get that.	A le ṣe iranlọwọ lati gba iyẹn.
I was caught.	Mo di nkan mu.
I have it now.	Mo tun ni bayi.
Easy for him to say.	Rọrun fun u lati sọ.
But you have a rule if people stay in your house.	Ṣugbọn o ni ofin kan ti awọn eniyan ba duro ni ile rẹ.
If any of them go, we can pick them up.	Ti eyikeyi ninu wọn ba lọ, a le gbe wọn.
We try to do the best we can.	A gbiyanju lati ṣe ohun ti o dara julọ ti a le.
You have told me about it.	O ti sọ fun mi nipa rẹ.
Many of them came and went.	Pupọ ninu wọn wa o si lọ.
He also raised his voice.	O tun gbe ohun soke.
You only want the best for yourself.	Ohun ti o dara julọ nikan ni o fẹ fun ara rẹ.
Wait a minute.	Duro fun iṣẹju kan.
And it will not be easy.	Ati pe kii yoo rọrun.
Everything seems fine to me.	Ohun gbogbo dabi pe o dara fun mi.
I don’t want or need anything beyond that.	Emi ko fẹ tabi nilo ohunkohun ti o kọja iyẹn.
It’s a bit.	O jẹ diẹ.
It should be me taking it.	O yẹ ki o jẹ mi ti o mu.
As they are.	Bi wọn ṣe jẹ.
Both learn by observation.	Awọn mejeeji kọ ẹkọ nipasẹ akiyesi.
That is yours.	Tirẹ niyẹn.
I am very happy.	Inu mi dun pupo.
On my friends.	Lori awọn ọrẹ mi.
Along the way he heard something.	Ni ọna o gbọ ohun kan.
If you get it back, maybe.	Ti o ba gba pada, boya.
See and.	Wo ati.
I'll see.	Emi yoo wo.
He put the kids in the car.	O fi awọn ọmọde sinu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ.
This is the highest truth.	Eyi ni otitọ ti o ga julọ.
He stayed in the store for two hours.	O duro ni ile itaja fun wakati meji.
Some of these people love me.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan wọnyi nifẹ mi.
However, there are a few points to consider here.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn aaye diẹ wa lati ṣe akiyesi nibi.
Only his eyes moved.	Oju rẹ nikan ni o gbe.
This text is very difficult to read.	Ọrọ yii nira pupọ lati ka.
He told me not to do anything.	O ni ki n ma se nkankan.
That is what our people do not know.	Ohun ti awon eniyan wa ko mo niyen.
I hope they will.	Mo nireti pe wọn yoo.
This is possible to continue.	Eyi ṣee ṣe lati tẹsiwaju.
But the problem is that it is not perfect.	Ṣugbọn iṣoro naa ni pe ko pe.
But there is no way to be honest.	Ṣugbọn ko si ọna lati jẹ otitọ.
You never asked me about that.	O ko beere lọwọ mi nipa iyẹn.
Tonight will be my bed.	Ni alẹ oni yoo jẹ ibusun mi.
Maybe it was a few minutes.	Boya o jẹ iṣẹju diẹ.
It comes with a lot of stuff.	O wa pẹlu ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
The test continues only after a decision.	Idanwo naa tẹsiwaju nikan lẹhin ipinnu kan.
After we were married.	Lẹhin ti a ni won ni iyawo.
The book has not changed over the years.	Iwe naa ko ti yipada ni awọn ọdun.
She is making bread that sells bread.	O n ṣe ounjẹ ti o ta akara.
I told him to look.	Mo sọ fun u pe ki o wo.
We were so few.	A wà ki diẹ.
Add yours today.	Fi tirẹ kun loni.
That was a few years ago.	Iyẹn jẹ ọdun diẹ sẹhin.
I'll have to move.	Emi yoo ni lati gbe.
Observation tools no longer work.	Awọn ohun elo akiyesi ko ṣiṣẹ mọ.
You just have to tell them the truth.	O kan ni lati sọ otitọ fun wọn.
He has lost his job.	O ti padanu iṣẹ rẹ.
That may not be necessary.	Iyẹn ko le nilo.
He is working this story for us.	O n ṣiṣẹ itan yii fun wa.
I never thought about it.	Emi ko ronu nipa rẹ rara.
I miss wondering about people and missing them.	Mo padanu iyalẹnu nipa awọn eniyan ati padanu wọn.
But it seems to me that he is doing well now.	Ṣugbọn o dabi si mi pe o n ṣe daradara ni bayi.
At one time my father was not there.	Ni akoko kan baba mi ko si nibẹ.
I also need to feel your hand in me.	Mo tun nilo lati lero ọwọ rẹ ninu mi.
He brought it out.	O mu u jade.
Whatever happens, everyone will still be angry.	Ohunkohun ti o ṣẹlẹ, gbogbo eniyan yoo tun binu.
Impossible, simple as that.	Ko le ṣee ṣe, rọrun bi iyẹn.
To be under constant observation.	Lati wa labẹ akiyesi nigbagbogbo.
First, because this helps me find new ones.	Ni akọkọ, nitori eyi ṣe iranlọwọ fun mi lati wa awọn tuntun.
The best.	O ti dara ju.
In fact, we ask everyone.	Ni otitọ, a beere lọwọ gbogbo eniyan.
People are leaving the position every other day.	Awọn eniyan n fi ipo silẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ miiran.
No word will come, nothing.	Ko si ọrọ ti yoo wa, ko si nkankan.
He asked us for some tea.	O beere fun wa tii diẹ.
But it can only be a foot table.	Ṣugbọn o le jẹ ẹsẹ tabili nikan.
I mean, don’t get me wrong, it’s really amazing in it.	Mo tumọ si, maṣe gba mi ni aṣiṣe, o jẹ iyalẹnu gaan ni rẹ.
But for more it is about the house.	Ṣugbọn fun diẹ sii o jẹ nipa ile naa.
I don’t know how that could happen.	Emi ko mọ bi iyẹn ṣe le ṣẹlẹ.
What? 	Kini?
I hope you will too.	Mo nireti pe iwọ yoo tun.
It is a simple question.	O jẹ ibeere ti o rọrun.
But that only works if both parties do things.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ṣiṣẹ nikan ti ẹgbẹ mejeeji ba ṣe awọn nkan.
The idea is simple.	Ero naa rọrun.
See how you eat.	Wo bi o ṣe jẹun.
It may be too late in some cases.	O le pẹ ju ni awọn igba miiran.
I like this very well.	Mo feran eyi dara julọ.
I have to marry a woman.	Mo ni lati fẹ obinrin kan.
These are my people.	Awọn wọnyi ni eniyan mi.
Soon it may be almost possible.	Laipẹ o le fẹrẹ ṣee ṣe.
Without children and no desire to reach the area.	Laisi awọn ọmọde ati pe ko si ifẹ lati de agbegbe naa.
That is an amazing news.	Iyẹn jẹ iroyin iyalẹnu.
The sister did not know how long.	Arabinrin naa ko mọ bi o ti pẹ to.
This is very important to me.	Eyi ṣe pataki pupọ fun mi.
I just want to forget it all.	Mo kan fẹ lati gbagbe gbogbo rẹ.
End of summer.	Ipari ti ooru.
Even after this many years.	Paapaa lẹhin eyi ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
It was the first week of summer vacation.	O jẹ ọsẹ akọkọ ti isinmi ooru.
We know it.	A mọ rẹ.
There are a lot of people.	Pupọ eniyan ni.
Learn more rules.	Kọ ẹkọ diẹ sii ofin.
Use what works.	Lo ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ.
Of course, this will require more children.	Dajudaju, eyi yoo nilo awọn ọmọde diẹ sii.
Surprisingly good.	Iyalẹnu dara.
This is for several reasons.	Eyi jẹ nitori ọpọlọpọ awọn idi.
Why walk when you can ride?	Kini idi ti o fi rin nigbati o le gun?
He told me that story.	O sọ itan yẹn fun mi.
Even my mother didn’t take me.	Paapaa iya mi ko mu mi.
His mother was right.	Iya rẹ tọ.
I'll have to come back to this.	Emi yoo ni lati pada wa si eyi.
And in a few minutes, that method works in public.	Ati iṣẹju diẹ ni, ọna yẹn n ṣiṣẹ ni gbangba.
He loves us very much.	O nifẹ wa pupọ.
This is not our problem.	Eyi kii ṣe iṣoro wa.
No game ideas, friends.	Ko si ere ero, awọn ọrẹ.
I can understand that.	Mo le loye iyẹn.
Who did all the talking.	Ẹniti o ṣe gbogbo ọrọ naa.
Travel to the suburbs is difficult.	Irin-ajo lọ si awọn agbegbe ita jẹ nira.
I do not want to do these things.	Emi ko fẹ lati ṣe nkan wọnyi.
He lifted up and looked inside.	O gbe oke kuro o wo inu.
However, your application does not always need to call this method.	Sibẹsibẹ, ohun elo rẹ ko nilo nigbagbogbo lati pe ọna yii.
He is looking at the house.	O n wo ile naa.
I picked up the phone.	Mo gba foonu naa.
You are asking my question.	O n beere ibeere mi.
Ask about the special week.	Beere nipa awọn pataki ọsẹ.
Whatever you have done, you have completed it fast.	Ohunkohun ti o ti ṣe, o ti pari rẹ sare.
Maybe some here are feeling that way right now.	Boya diẹ ninu awọn nibi n rilara ni ọna yẹn ni bayi.
I have time yet, but maybe not too much.	Mo ni akoko sibẹsibẹ, ṣugbọn boya kii ṣe pupọ pupọ.
Don't be too hard.	Maṣe jẹ lile ju.
I do not see yourself.	Emi ko rii funrararẹ.
They will kill us.	Wọn yoo pa wa.
You get it and give it.	O gba ki o fun.
Is still available.	Ti wa ni ṣi wa.
Water is the world.	Omi ni aye.
I put my hand on my heart.	Mo fi ọwọ mi si ọkan mi.
Promise is not a promise.	Ileri kii ṣe ileri.
The weather in this area is very hot in summer.	Oju ojo ni agbegbe yii gbona pupọ ninu ooru.
None of them said anything.	Ko si ọkan ninu wọn ti o sọ ohunkohun.
We should use materials wisely.	A yẹ ki o lo awọn ohun elo pẹlu ọgbọn.
We cannot change.	A ko le yi pada.
Okay let me explain a little more.	O dara jẹ ki n ṣe alaye diẹ diẹ sii.
I do not think they will.	Emi ko ro pe wọn yoo.
I don’t want you to worry about yourself.	Emi ko fẹ ki o ni aniyan nipa ara rẹ.
There is no money to make in it anymore.	Ko si owo lati ṣe ninu rẹ mọ.
Not all of us.	Ko gbogbo wa.
But they are enough.	Ṣugbọn wọn ti to.
He went with her.	O lọ pẹlu rẹ.
The house comes with pretty much everything you will need while you are there.	Ile wa pẹlu lẹwa Elo ohun gbogbo ti o yoo nilo nigba ti o wa nibẹ.
I have not seen it.	Emi ko tii ri i.
I'll go out for the money.	Emi yoo jade fun owo naa.
Listen to it carefully.	Gbọ rẹ daradara.
You will make a big mistake.	Iwọ yoo ṣe aṣiṣe nla kan.
Remember, you do not have to make any decisions on your own.	Ranti, o ko ni lati ṣe ipinnu eyikeyi funrararẹ.
That would have been a decision.	Iyẹn yoo ti jẹ ipinnu.
I would like better.	Emi yoo fẹ dara julọ.
Now when I work the work does not work.	Bayi nigbati mo ba ṣiṣẹ iṣẹ naa ko ṣiṣẹ.
Okay, let’s put your energy to the test.	O dara, jẹ ki a fi agbara rẹ si idanwo.
That should be it.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o jẹ.
He looked me up.	O wo mi soke.
You have to do it all manually.	O gbọdọ ṣe gbogbo rẹ pẹlu ọwọ.
He looked ahead, not moving.	O wo iwaju, ko gbe.
Again he wondered if he came to the project.	Lẹẹkansi o ṣe iyalẹnu boya o wa si iṣẹ naa.
Just don't cut it.	O kan ko ge o.
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.	Nigba miiran o ṣiṣẹ ati nigba miiran ko ṣe.
He will not take anything out of it.	Oun kii yoo gba ohunkohun jade ninu rẹ.
Do not lift your head.	Maṣe gbe ori rẹ.
This can be anything you want.	Eyi le jẹ ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
Life has left little to lose.	Igbesi aye ti fi silẹ diẹ lati padanu.
Put it like that, it looks good.	Fi bii iyẹn, o dabi pe o dara.
There are many other places for relaxation.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn aaye miiran wa fun isinmi.
No one stood by me.	Ko si ọkan ti o duro pẹlu mi.
Can someone help me with this.	Le ẹnikan ran mi pẹlu yi.
And you have to get out of this house.	Ati pe o ni lati jade kuro ni ile yii.
You have to run for it.	O ni lati ṣiṣe fun.
He never wrote it down.	Ko kọ ọ silẹ rara.
We cannot give you everything you want.	A ko le fun ọ ni ohun gbogbo ti o fẹ.
They will never rise again.	Wọn kii yoo tun dide lẹẹkansi.
Let's move on.	Jẹ ki a tẹsiwaju.
You are looking for understanding but you will not have it.	Iwọ n wa oye ṣugbọn iwọ kii yoo ni.
But even easier to read in teacher.	Ṣugbọn paapaa rọrun lati ka ni olukọ.
The truth is the truth.	Otitọ ni otitọ.
My brother has a car.	Arakunrin mi ni ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.

Everyone is at home.	Gbogbo eniyan ni ile.

But the issue is money.	Ṣugbọn ọrọ naa wa ni owo.
But two games would have made him a better world.	Ṣugbọn awọn ere meji yoo ti ṣe fun u ni aye ti o dara.
It is for you.	O ti wa fun ọ.
Some agree that it is written, but not all.	Diẹ ninu awọn gba wipe o ti kọ, sugbon ko gbogbo.

Kill them all and cut them.	Pa gbogbo wọn ki o si ge wọn.
I understand very well that it is likely to be understood.	Mo loye daradara pe o ṣeeṣe ni a fun ni oye.
Is that the best you can be with?	Iyẹn dara julọ ti o le wa pẹlu?
I accept it.	Mo gba e.
Other information must be available.	Alaye miiran gbọdọ wa.
It's blowing on your hand.	O n fẹ lori ọwọ rẹ.
If you find it, you use that.	Ti o ba rii, o lo iyẹn.
As he received, he gave.	Bi o ti gba, o fun.
Some friends left clothes for us too.	Awọn ọrẹ kan fi aṣọ silẹ fun wa pẹlu.

You have known him ever since.	O ti mọ ọ lati igba naa.
You get it in your own way.	O gba ni ọna tirẹ.
It's too small.	O jẹ kekere pupọ.
I can let it be.	Mo le jẹ ki o wa.
That sounds like you because it is.	Iyẹn dabi iwọ nitori pe o jẹ.
She looked at me in amazement.	O wo mi ni iyalẹnu.
But can not, because he is already married.	Sugbon ko le, nitori o ti tẹlẹ iyawo.
I refused, and he began to move.	Mo kọ, o si bẹrẹ si gbe.
Let them think of you.	Jẹ ki wọn ro ero rẹ.
That will change in the future.	Iyẹn yoo yipada ni ọjọ iwaju.
It looks like in the game.	O dabi ninu ere naa.
Of course we are good friends.	Dajudaju a jẹ ọrẹ to dara.
Maybe they’ll be better off.	Boya wọn yoo dara julọ.
History will remember it well.	Itan yoo ranti rẹ daradara.
She is worried about her children.	O jẹ aniyan nipa awọn ọmọ rẹ.

And these things run into a certain amount of money.	Ati nkan wọnyi ṣiṣe awọn sinu kan awọn iye ti owo.
Three of them are women.	Mẹta ninu wọn jẹ obinrin.
So we more or less changed places.	Nitorina a diẹ sii tabi kere si yipada awọn aaye.
They are only there and you have to deal with it.	Wọn wa nibẹ nikan ati pe o gbọdọ ṣe pẹlu.
He looked back outside.	O wo pada si ita.

It is very easy to find them.	O rọrun pupọ lati wa wọn.
He always does.	O ṣe nigbagbogbo.
Let's start again.	Jẹ ká bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
It was a delicious meal.	O jẹ ohun ounjẹ ti o dun.
One has brought a man back into the room.	Ọkan ti mu ọkunrin kan pada si yara.
It just doesn’t get the game we should be doing.	O kan ko gba ere ti a yẹ ki o ṣe.
Here it is.	Ibi ni o ṣe.
He did not expect that.	Ko nireti iyẹn.
I think you may have died.	Mo ro pe o le ti ku.
Or one of them.	Tabi ọkan ninu wọn.
I want to.	Mo fẹ.
Do not give up your day job.	Maṣe fi iṣẹ ọjọ rẹ silẹ.
It would have been nice.	Yoo ti dara.
Let me tell you something.	Jẹ ki n sọ nkankan fun ọ.
Human determination is important.	Ipinnu eniyan jẹ pataki.
Just a little.	O kan kekere kan.
As soon as possible.	Ni kete bi o ti ṣee.
Not myself.	Kii ṣe ara mi.
You will make a tea and drink a hot tea.	O yoo ṣe kan tii ati ki o mu kan gbona tii.
If you read that, it is a little more recent.	Ti o ba ka iyẹn, o jẹ diẹ diẹ laipẹ.
Most people do.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ṣe.
But he is not.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe oun.
The child should be able to see that.	Ọmọde yẹ ki o ni anfani lati rii iyẹn.
Just know.	O kan mọ.
It will be important.	Yoo ṣe pataki.
It is the kind of company we want to work with.	O jẹ iru ile-iṣẹ ti a fẹ lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
We have no more time to lose.	A ko ni akoko diẹ sii lati padanu.
The word will mean.	Ọrọ naa yoo tumọ.
She tells him she can make her own decisions.	O sọ fun u pe o le ṣe awọn ipinnu tirẹ.
Your summer of work.	Igba ooru rẹ ti iṣẹ.
This will not be an easy game for me.	Eyi kii yoo jẹ ere ti o rọrun fun mi.
That’s how small it is.	Iyẹn ni bi o ti jẹ kekere.
I left fast food two years ago.	Mo fi ounjẹ yara silẹ ni ọdun meji sẹhin.
As such, we will all grow.	Bii eyi, gbogbo wa yoo dagba.
I do not have any.	Emi ko ni eyikeyi.
In the same year, he received his law degree.	Ni ọdun kanna, o gba oye ofin rẹ.
In a day or so, the flames will return.	Ni ọjọ kan tabi bii, awọn ina yoo pada wa.
I find it very beautiful.	Mo rii pe o lẹwa pupọ.
Ask for everything you hear and see.	Beere ohun gbogbo ti o gbọ ati ki o ri.
You’re talking about someone who says something about whatever.	O n sọrọ nipa ẹnikan ti o sọ nkankan nipa ohunkohun ti.
They are beautiful eyes.	Wọn jẹ oju ti o lẹwa.
I can't believe it would have hurt her.	Emi ko le gbagbọ o yoo ti ipalara rẹ.
I know you can.	Mo mọ pe o le ṣe.
They love and need me.	Wọn nifẹ ati nilo mi.
I will drink.	Emi yoo mu.

The service does not have such a problem.	Iṣẹ naa ko ni iru iṣoro bẹẹ.
He wants to fly.	O fe fo.
Go where you can hold them for a minute.	Lọ si ibiti o ti le mu wọn fun iṣẹju kan.
These shoes are made for running.	Awọn bata wọnyi ni a ṣe fun ṣiṣe.
You don’t need to tell me.	O ko nilo lati sọ fun mi.
He said he needed it for his job.	O sọ pe o nilo fun iṣẹ rẹ.
It is important to know the rules of the game.	O ṣe pataki lati mọ awọn ofin ti ere naa.
I am not sure what will happen.	Emi ko da mi loju ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
He is taking a break next year.	O n gba isinmi ni ọdun to nbọ.
It also makes you feel like a child again.	O tun jẹ ki o lero bi ọmọde lẹẹkansi.
It just happened.	O kan ṣẹlẹ nikan.
We come from people and they come from us.	A wa lati awọn eniyan ati pe wọn wa lati ọdọ wa.
Fresh water is available, but it is too sweet to drink.	Omi tuntun lo wa, sugbon o dun ju lati mu.
Everyone then rejoice.	Gbogbo eniyan ki o si yọ.
He has no place.	Ko ni aye kankan.
It should work now.	O yẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ ni bayi.
Get a bus to visit.	Gba ọkọ akero kan lati ṣabẹwo.
I put everything in perspective, everything about myself.	Mo fi ohun gbogbo sinu gaan, ohun gbogbo nipa ara mi.
And he really loves this guy.	Ati pe o nifẹ eniyan yii gaan.
Trees, shrubs and more trees.	Awọn igi, awọn igi ati awọn igi diẹ sii.
Not sure what the best way to go about it.	Ko daju kini ọna ti o dara julọ lati lọ nipa rẹ.
First you.	Ni akọkọ iwọ.
Just asking.	O kan n beere.
He was forced to leave.	O fi agbara mu lati lọ kuro.
I fear nothing.	Emi bẹru ohunkohun.
I'm afraid that's all we have.	Mo bẹru pe iyẹn ni gbogbo ohun ti a ni.
It is easy to buy into it.	O rọrun lati ra sinu rẹ.
Shoes, you also remember.	Awọn bata, o tun ranti.
I do not want that to happen again.	Emi ko fẹ ki iyẹn tun ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi.
My father is looking for me, not me.	Baba mi lo n wa, kii se fun mi.
I try my best in time to keep my eyes on the right.	Mo gbiyanju gbogbo agbara mi ni akoko lati tọju oju ti o tọ.
Is everything alright?	Se ohun gbogbo dara?
I did something wrong.	Mo ṣe nkan buburu.
The days grew hot, and cool again.	Awọn ọjọ dagba gbona, ati ki o dara lẹẹkansi.
It was amazing to see.	O jẹ iyalẹnu lati rii.
People also keep their eyes on what is going on.	Awọn eniyan tun pa oju wọn mọ ohun ti n lọ.
He brought the table we wanted for our first meeting.	O mu tabili ti a fẹ ni fun ipade akọkọ wa.
And not by a few.	Ati pe kii ṣe nipasẹ diẹ.
And other time details are as good.	Ati awọn alaye akoko miiran jẹ dara bi.
Insist that you do the same.	Ta ku pe o ṣe kanna.
But the girl was behind him.	Ṣugbọn ọmọbirin naa ni ẹhin rẹ.
This can go both ways.	Eyi le lọ ni ọna mejeeji.
I do not see anyone.	Nko ri enikeni.
All of you.	Gbogbo yin.
I do not mind.	Mo binu.
Don't worry about the money.	Maṣe ṣe aniyan nipa owo naa.
Everyone is there for the right reason.	Gbogbo eniyan wa nibẹ fun idi ti o tọ.
We won a game for that!	A gba ere kan fun iyẹn!
They don’t mean to go as you do.	Wọn ko tumọ si pe ki o lọ bi o ti ṣe.
That is coming, you know.	Iyẹn n bọ, o mọ.
I need to know, to see.	Mo nilo lati mọ, lati rii.
She helps him into his new shoes.	O ṣe iranlọwọ fun u sinu bata tuntun rẹ.
You can sleep on top.	O le sun lori oke.
If you walk away, others will come.	Ti o ba rin kuro, awọn miiran yoo wa.
I just love this guy.	Mo kan nifẹ ọkunrin yii.
I started running.	Mo bẹrẹ ṣiṣe.
He knows the word well.	O mọ ọrọ naa daradara.
We can know many things.	A le mọ ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan.
Our police are members of this community.	Awọn ọlọpa wa jẹ ọmọ ẹgbẹ ti agbegbe yii.
See below.	Wo isalẹ.
Side effects will have the same meaning.	Awọn nkan ẹgbẹ yoo ni ọrọ kanna.
Okay, you know.	O dara, o mọ.
He is climbing up now.	O n gun oke bayi.
And to do so, you have to continue the game.	Ati lati ṣe bẹ, o ni lati tẹsiwaju awọn ere.
It just seems so bad, right now.	O kan dabi ẹni buburu, ni bayi.
Now it is your life.	Bayi o jẹ igbesi aye rẹ.
This button activates the light.	Bọtini yi mu ina ṣiṣẹ.
In fact, it is one.	Ni otitọ, o jẹ ọkan.
It is time to let them decide their future.	O to akoko lati jẹ ki wọn pinnu ọjọ iwaju wọn.
When the music stopped, he got to his feet.	Nigbati orin duro, o dide si ẹsẹ rẹ.
You have this or that, one word is that or that.	Iwọ ni eyi tabi iyẹn, ọrọ kan ni iyẹn tabi eyi.
I would like to know why.	Emi yoo fẹ lati mọ idi.
But please come forward about the financial situation.	Ṣugbọn jọwọ wa ni iwaju nipa ipo owo.
I do not tell anyone.	Nko so fun enikeni.
In time, you will.	Ni akoko, iwọ yoo.
At the very least you have an old thing.	Ni o kere pupọ o ni ohun atijọ.
That is true, as it goes.	Iyẹn jẹ otitọ, bi o ti lọ.
Some, however, have opened a way about it.	Diẹ ninu awọn, sibẹsibẹ, ti ṣii ọna kan nipa rẹ.
The woman also slept.	Obinrin naa tun sun.
We think that is not our problem.	A ro pe kii ṣe iṣoro wa.
So much to think about.	Ki Elo lati ro nipa.
Do it, if so you can leave.	Ṣe o ti ṣe, ti o ba jẹ bẹ o le lọ kuro.
This information is up to date.	Alaye yi ti wa ni ti ọjọ.
Many things can also go wrong.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan le tun lọ ni aṣiṣe.
But it is not a good fact.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe otitọ ti o dara.
The water is hot.	Omi naa gbona.
This house has a story to love.	Ile yii ni itan ti o nifẹ si.
We just want to hurt ourselves.	A o kan fẹ lati ṣe ipalara fun ara wa.
And you know about it.	Ati pe o mọ nipa rẹ.
This is new.	Eyi jẹ tuntun.
It does not mean the 'other' person.	Ko tumọ si eniyan 'miiran' naa.
Now he raises his head.	Bayi o gbe ori rẹ soke.
We took whatever they allowed.	A mu ohunkohun ti won laaye.
They are beautiful.	Wọn lẹwa.
I love everything about it.	Mo fẹran ohun gbogbo nipa rẹ.
And on them go.	Ati lori wọn lọ.
Let’s continue with the work.	Jẹ ki a tẹsiwaju pẹlu iṣẹ naa.
Just call what you want.	O kan pe ohun ti o fẹ.
We’re laughing for a minute.	A n rẹrin iṣẹju kan.
He was a man who knew the situation.	O jẹ eniyan ti o mọ ipo naa.
The baby will drop.	Ọmọ naa yoo ju silẹ.
Of course you need it.	Dajudaju o nilo rẹ.
He seemed to come to a conclusion.	O dabi enipe o wa si ipinnu kan.
This food is.	Ounjẹ yii jẹ.
I am convinced that life must continue.	Mo ti gba dajudaju pe igbesi aye gbọdọ tẹsiwaju.
You are the father of the boy.	Iwọ ni baba ọmọkunrin naa.
We do not, therefore we can not.	A ko, nitorina a ko le.
I'm also going to the law.	Mo tun n lọ si ofin.
Change again.	Yi pada lẹẹkansi.
Don't see.	Maṣe ri.
Road money does not take money.	Opopona owo ko gba owo.
This should give you the information you need.	Eyi yẹ ki o fun ọ ni alaye ti o nilo.
You have to come.	O ni lati wa.
You might even like it.	O le paapaa fẹran rẹ.
He did not come home.	Ko wa si ile.
Write your own rules.	Kọ awọn ofin tirẹ.
The cat's stomach was open.	Inu ologbo naa han gbangba.
We need someone like you there.	A nilo ẹnikan bi rẹ nibẹ.
Can't say anything of enough space.	Ko le sọ ohunkohun ti aaye to to.
You know, like a day.	O mọ, bi ọjọ kan.
They alone could not see it that way.	Awọn nikan ni wọn ko le ri i ni ọna yẹn.
It will be a long night, however.	O yoo jẹ alẹ pipẹ, ṣugbọn.
He does not know these people.	Oun ko mọ awọn eniyan wọnyi.
A week written about truth and honesty.	Ọsẹ ti a kọ nipa otitọ ati otitọ.
You may have stopped a good meal or two.	O le ti duro ounjẹ to dara tabi meji.
It is true, there are other dogs.	O jẹ otitọ, awọn aja miiran wa.
He will use it.	Oun yoo lo o.
The plane is waiting.	Ọkọ ofurufu n duro de.
It has been.	O ti wa.
I'm on it for a minute.	Mo wa lori rẹ ni iṣẹju kan.
It should not be.	O yẹ ki o ko ni.
I have the injury.	Emi ni ipalara naa.
With my own.	Pẹlu ti ara mi.
I do not want to eat anything at this time.	Emi ko fẹ lati jẹ ohunkohun ni akoko yii.
Or a new test.	Tabi idanwo tuntun.
It will not give.	O yoo ko fun ni.
A few minutes passed.	Iṣẹju diẹ kọja.
They can help.	Wọn le ṣe iranlọwọ.
You may have to decide for yourself.	O le ni lati pinnu fun ara rẹ.
It can be hard to keep up with.	O le jẹ gidigidi lati tọju pẹlu.
I do not know the girl.	Emi ko mọ ọmọbirin naa.
They are two simple questions.	Wọn jẹ awọn ibeere ti o rọrun meji.
Not after last night.	Ko lẹhin kẹhin alẹ.
He will need that.	Oun yoo nilo iyẹn.
The father did not come out in the picture.	Baba naa ko jade ni aworan.
They will see it.	Won yoo ri i.
But only if we pull away.	Ṣugbọn nikan ti a ba fa kuro.
I want everything to be done the right way.	Mo fẹ ki ohun gbogbo ṣee ṣe ni ọna ti o tọ.
Just drop there.	Kan ju silẹ nibẹ.
I am always high for my age.	Mo ga nigbagbogbo fun ọjọ ori mi.
And other times, he moved.	Ati awọn igba miiran, o gbe.
For those who are not finished, proceed.	Fun awọn ti o ko ti pari, tẹsiwaju.
It needs to be good enough.	O nilo lati dara to.
High school teachers.	Awọn olukọ ile-iwe giga.
It was late, and it was an hour later.	O ti pẹ, ati pe o wa ni wakati kan lẹhin.
Wait a minute.	Duro fun iṣẹju kan.
Have you passed your test?	Njẹ o ti kọja idanwo rẹ?
It is a way of life.	O jẹ ọna igbesi aye.
Very good story.	Itan ti o dara pupọ.
You want to contact them.	O fẹ lati kan si wọn.
We can't wait any longer.	A ko le duro diẹ sii.
That woman was there, reading a book.	Obinrin yẹn wa nibẹ, ti o ka iwe kan.
They are not human.	Wọn kii ṣe eniyan.
He walked from school to the train station.	O rin lati ile-iwe si ibudo ọkọ oju irin.
I also believe it is a great idea.	Mo tun gbagbọ pe o jẹ imọran nla.
The journey will help you to understand.	Irin-ajo naa yoo ran ọ lọwọ lati ni oye.
Not a very good one.	Kii ṣe ọkan ti o dara pupọ.
If you can believe it.	Ti o ba le gbagbọ rẹ.
Let me work.	Jẹ ki n ṣiṣẹ.
It is a way to travel across the city.	O jẹ ọna lati rin irin-ajo kọja ilu naa.
We talked a lot.	A sọrọ pupọ.
Wood does not think so.	Igi ko ro bẹ.
And he was one of the family.	Ati pe o jẹ ọkan ninu idile naa.
But no one raised a hand.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o gbe ọwọ kan.
A few years ago, even higher.	Ni ọdun diẹ sẹhin, paapaa ga julọ.
It may be as you say.	O le jẹ pe o jẹ bi o ti sọ.
It’s not too late, and won’t be out until next week.	Ko pẹ pupọ, ati pe kii yoo jade titi di ọsẹ ti n bọ.
But at the time everything seemed possible.	Sugbon ni akoko ohun gbogbo dabi enipe o ti ṣee.
Let's talk about it.	Jẹ ki a sọrọ nipa rẹ.
There is always more.	Nigbagbogbo diẹ sii wa.
I ended up not being able to talk because of it.	Mo pari ni ko le sọrọ nitori rẹ.
And now you can have one and love it, too.	Ati ni bayi o le ni ọkan ati nifẹ rẹ, paapaa.
It makes us feel something.	O mu ki a lero nkankan.
I don’t, of course.	Emi ko ni, dajudaju.
At least something like this.	O kere ju nkan bii eyi.
You can tell a little bit of what you have seen '.	O le sọ diẹ diẹ ninu ohun ti o ti ri'.
He will not let you live.	Oun kii yoo jẹ ki o wa laaye.
I am very anxious.	Mo ni aniyan pupọ.
I have to accept that it is possible.	Mo ni lati gba pe o ṣee ṣe.
You do it for everyone and not just you.	O ṣe si gbogbo eniyan kii ṣe iwọ nikan.
You must have loved it to never forget.	O gbọdọ ti nifẹ rẹ lati ma gbagbe.
Don’t know if you have it or not.	Maṣe mọ boya o ni tabi rara.
On the face of it, the task is simple.	Lori oju rẹ, iṣẹ naa rọrun.
Good morning.	Oorun owurọ dara.
You are a family.	Idile ni yin.
Every year, people expect a summer vacation.	Ni gbogbo ọdun, awọn eniyan nireti isinmi igba ooru kan.
It will help if you keep the garden.	Yoo ṣe iranlọwọ ti o ba pa ọgba naa mọ.
Again he did what he said.	Lẹẹkansi o ṣe ohun ti o sọ.
I locked myself in my room.	Mo ti ara mi pa ninu yara mi.
He did not tell us.	Ko so fun wa.
He spoke at length about his work.	O sọrọ ni ipari nipa iṣẹ rẹ.
Something I would have loved to write.	Nkankan Emi yoo ti nifẹ lati kọ.
I can see your work outside.	Mo le rii iṣẹ rẹ ni ita ita.
As soon as you can.	Ni kete bi o ti le.
This really but he did.	Eleyi gan sugbon o ṣe.
I have books.	Mo ni awọn iwe.
Tell someone.	Sọ fun ẹnikan.
You can not stand on anything.	O ko le duro lori ohunkohun.
You know best.	O mọ julọ.
I can’t wait to hear how your first work day went.	Emi ko le duro lati gbọ bi ọjọ iṣẹ akọkọ rẹ ṣe lọ.
It was my time.	O je akoko mi.
He said what he told me.	O sọ ohun ti o sọ fun mi.
We note that the program will not work.	A ṣe akiyesi pe eto naa kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
He had a brother and a sister to talk to.	O ni arakunrin kan ati arabinrin kan lati ba sọrọ.
I told him the news.	Mo sọ iroyin naa fun u.
Some even do it in the winter.	Diẹ ninu awọn paapaa ṣe ni igba otutu.
You will be killed, if you touch me.	A yoo pa ọ, ti o ba fi ọwọ kan mi.
You can ask.	O le beere.
I would like that.	Emi yoo fẹ bẹ.
Of course that is not entirely true.	Dajudaju iyẹn kii ṣe otitọ patapata.
He doesn't like me at all.	Ko feran mi rara.
What that meal will change depends on the season.	Kini ounjẹ yẹn yoo yipada da lori akoko.
And of course not the face you might love.	Ati pe dajudaju kii ṣe oju ti o le nifẹ.
She will be with her husband.	O yoo wa pẹlu ọkọ rẹ.
The road is flooded.	Omi ti kun oju opopona.
You can do such a thing.	O le ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ.
You need to get out.	O nilo lati gba jade.
But how? 	Sugbon bawo?
I sat back up.	Mo ti joko pada soke.
Back to work.	Pada si iṣẹ.
To carry it.	Lati gbe e.
It is too late now to ask questions.	O ti pẹ ju bayi lati beere awọn ibeere.
You are here, you know now.	O wa nibi, o mọ ni bayi.
Not enough time to do the things you want.	Ko to akoko lati ṣe awọn nkan ti o fẹ.
We have to see.	A ni lati rii.
It is clear how important football is.	O han gbangba bi bọọlu ṣe ṣe pataki to.
At least the boys seemed happy.	Ni o kere awọn ọmọkunrin dabi enipe dun.
Do not kill a city.	Maṣe pa ilu kan.
Now go ask it.	Bayi lọ beere rẹ.
If they are watching us.	Ti won ba n wo wa.
They are all.	Gbogbo wọn jẹ.
That is what it should be.	Ohun ti o yẹ ki o jẹ niyẹn.
And know for themselves.	Ati ki o mọ fun ara wọn.
I am not convinced to believe it.	Emi ko da mi loju lati gbagbọ rẹ.
This thing is as good as it gets.	Nkan yi dara bi o ti pari.
Here it is.	Eyi ni.
But he did.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe.
They spent most of the day working on it.	Wọn ti lo julọ ti ọjọ ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ.
That would be nice.	Iyẹn yoo dara.
You really do not know.	O gan ko mọ.
You’re getting out of trouble by making you laugh.	O n jade kuro ninu wahala nipa ṣiṣe rẹrin.
I will never understand women.	Emi kii yoo loye awọn obinrin rara.
And this time they took it one day.	Ati ni akoko yii wọn mu ni ọjọ kan.
We ride with them.	A gun pẹlu wọn.
I just have one.	Mo kan ni ọkan.
I will take you to your destination.	Emi yoo mu ọ lọ si ibiti o gbọdọ lọ.
A few cars were left to go.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ diẹ ni o ku lati lọ.
I was completely convinced.	Mo da mi loju patapata.
I was completely bad.	Mo jẹ buburu patapata.
And they don’t have all that stuff.	Ati pe wọn ko ni gbogbo nkan yẹn.
Let's go to that new restaurant for dinner.	Jẹ ki a lọ si ile ounjẹ tuntun yẹn fun ounjẹ alẹ.
You can have breakfast at school.	O le jẹun owurọ ni ile-iwe.
So many people see this as a bad thing.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ eniyan rii eyi bi ohun buburu.
I need you to show me your hand.	Mo nilo ki o fi ọwọ rẹ han.
You might even enjoy seeing it in a year.	O le paapaa gbadun lati rii ni ọdun kan.
I'm just angry with you.	Mo kan binu si ọ.
But it does not appear to be noticeable.	Ṣugbọn ko han lati ṣe akiyesi.
Pretty much like this.	Lẹwa pupọ bi eyi.
She forced herself to let go of the great opportunity.	O fi agbara mu ara rẹ lati jẹ ki o lọ fun anfani nla.
Making it felt.	Ṣiṣe rẹ ro.
Of course we meet again.	Dajudaju a tun pade.
You may find it.	O ṣee ṣe ki o rii.
It worked well for us.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara fun wa.
But it will not be so.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo ṣe bẹ.
He thought he was staying with me one night.	O ro pe o duro pẹlu mi ni alẹ kan.
This is where your baby will be born.	Eyi ni ibi ti ọmọ rẹ yoo ti bi.
We are planning to get married in two months now.	A n gbero lati ṣe igbeyawo ni oṣu meji si bayi.
That works well.	Iyẹn ṣiṣẹ daradara.
It is a new world.	Aye tuntun ni.
But even that is not enough.	Ṣugbọn paapaa iyẹn ko to.
Do not try to tell me what to do.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati sọ fun mi kini lati ṣe.
It is better not to be angry.	O dara julọ ki o maṣe binu.
It doesn't grow much here.	Ko dagba pupọ nibi.
They could not find their way.	Wọn ko le wa ọna wọn.
But please do not feel that they have an agreement.	Ṣugbọn jọwọ maṣe lero pe wọn ni adehun.
There is so much more to learn.	Pupọ diẹ sii wa lati kọ ẹkọ.
Tell me everything, every last little thing.	Sọ ohun gbogbo fun mi, gbogbo nkan kekere ti o kẹhin.
That should be good news.	Iyẹn yẹ ki o jẹ iroyin ti o dara.
You can make your site again.	O le ṣe aaye rẹ lẹẹkansi.
But nothing ever remains the same.	Sugbon ti ohunkohun ko lailai wa kanna.
We will plan your proposal.	A yoo gbero imọran rẹ.
For us it is our life to give.	Fun wa o jẹ aye wa lati fun.
Maybe it's the same.	Boya o jẹ kanna.
At least, they didn’t die.	O kere ju, wọn ko ku.
And this is a big decision.	Ati pe eyi jẹ ipinnu nla kan.
I do not have.	Emi ko ni.
I will do any work you require.	Emi yoo ṣe iṣẹ eyikeyi ti o beere.
He picked up the dog.	O gbe aja naa.
Some people need to eat more.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan nilo lati jẹun diẹ.
Stories got angry at him and he left.	Awọn itan ti binu si rẹ o si fi i silẹ.
He can't walk now.	Ko le rin ni bayi.
You have.	O ni.
I turned my head.	Mo yi ori mi pada.
Listen, we’ll let you get back to work.	Gbọ, a yoo jẹ ki o pada si iṣẹ.
I do not expect it to appear so.	Emi ko nireti pe yoo han bẹ.
I do not know how bad.	Emi ko mo bi buburu.
Not just with me, with anyone who wants to hear.	Kii ṣe pẹlu mi nikan, pẹlu ẹnikẹni ti o fẹ lati gbọ.
He rejected my advice.	O kọ imọran mi silẹ.
Everyone has an agreement.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o ni adehun.
They will not learn more.	Wọn kii yoo kọ diẹ sii.
Write the book.	Kọ iwe naa.
It can't be.	Ko le jẹ.
Give them something to look at and you will make them happy.	Fun wọn ni nkan lati wo ati pe iwọ yoo mu wọn dun.
You look at your watch.	O wo aago rẹ.
The word he gave you.	Ọrọ ti o fun ọ.
And cooking is about more than food.	Ati ṣiṣe ounjẹ jẹ nipa diẹ sii ju ounjẹ lọ.
Take a moment to think back over the last day or two.	Gba akoko kan lati ronu pada lori ọjọ ti o kẹhin tabi meji.
We stopped around talking for a while.	A duro ni ayika sọrọ fun igba diẹ.
Our past is gone, our future is not yet.	Ohun ti o ti kọja wa ti lọ, ọjọ iwaju wa ko tii wa.
That’s natural, of course, but man is human.	Iyẹn jẹ bi o ti yẹ, dajudaju, ṣugbọn eniyan jẹ eniyan.
Depends on yourself, not on others.	Da lori ara rẹ, kii ṣe lori awọn miiran.
I was too scared to ask.	Mo bẹru pupọ lati beere.
Now, we have gone to bed.	Bayi, a ti lọ si ibusun.
I think a lot of people stuck at that time.	Mo ro pe ọpọlọpọ eniyan di ni akoko yẹn.
I take all this seriously.	Mo n gba gbogbo eyi ni pataki.
This is now used as a tree.	Eyi ti lo bayi bi igi.
He jumped from his seat.	O si fo lati rẹ ijoko.
Stories from.	Awọn itan lati.
It takes a few minutes.	O gba to iṣẹju diẹ.
I think its conclusion is already here.	Mo ro pe ipari rẹ ti wa nibi tẹlẹ.
I'm trying to think of something.	Mo n gbiyanju lati ronu nkan kan.
This is a thought.	Eleyi jẹ a ronu.
I need it with me here.	Mo nilo rẹ pẹlu mi nibi.
She had other girls in her life.	O ni awọn ọmọbirin miiran ninu igbesi aye rẹ.
They are the ones who will change the world.	Wọn jẹ awọn ti yoo yi aye pada.
You will know your company.	Iwọ yoo mọ ile-iṣẹ rẹ.
They don’t seem to be too much to continue.	Wọn ko dabi ẹni pe wọn wa pupọ lati tẹsiwaju.
To see them as gifts and abilities.	Lati wo wọn bi awọn ẹbun ati awọn agbara.
He hopes he will be at the party.	O nireti pe oun yoo wa ni ibi ayẹyẹ naa.
Up to my head, my head.	Titi di ori mi, ori mi.
But not sure.	Sugbon ko daju.
I do not do such things.	Emi ko ṣe iru awọn nkan bẹẹ.
Someone who has changed.	Ẹnikan ti o ti yi pada.
Big eyes on that person.	Awọn oju nla lori eniyan yẹn.
He wanted me to tell you.	O fe mi so fun o.
Laughter makes everyone turn to listen.	Rẹrin mu ki gbogbo eniyan yipada lati gbọ.
Do your best, he said.	Ṣe gbogbo agbara rẹ, o sọ.
I don't sleep.	Nko sun.
Not even a dog.	Ko paapaa aja kan.
He was young in his imagination.	O jẹ ọmọde ni oju inu rẹ.
People just put up.	Eniyan ti o kan fi soke.
I need them to be the same.	Mo nilo wọn lati jẹ kanna.
But not much.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe pupọ.
If they can use, please let me know.	Ti wọn ba le lo, jọwọ jẹ ki mi mọ.
It is not your job.	Kii ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
Did you sleep well tonight?	Ṣe o sun daradara ni alẹ oni?
Or maybe not there to start with.	Tabi boya ko si nibẹ lati bẹrẹ pẹlu.
I have two more.	Mo ni meji miiran.
It is there now.	O wa nibẹ ni bayi.
Make your decision now.	Ṣe ipinnu rẹ ni bayi.
We do not know why this is noticeable.	A ko mọ idi ti eyi fi ṣe akiyesi.
Do not hate this woman.	Maṣe korira obinrin yii.
There is a way for everyone.	Ọna kan wa fun gbogbo eniyan.
Out and in.	Jade ati ni.
Maybe one day time will come.	Boya ni ọjọ kan akoko yoo wa.
Not one yet.	Ko ṣe ọkan sibẹsibẹ.
His eyes met hers.	Oju rẹ pade rẹ.
Make time to eat good food.	Ṣe akoko lati jẹ ounjẹ to dara.
Pa a sun.	Pa a sun.
But he did not accept.	Ṣugbọn ko gba.
I love your sister.	Mo nifẹ arabinrin rẹ.
Where you grew up and where you live.	Ibi ti o dagba ati ibi ti o ngbe.
It's simple and it works.	O rọrun ati pe o ṣiṣẹ.
Well they made a mistake.	Daradara wọn ṣe aṣiṣe.
Pick up after your dog.	Gbe soke lẹhin rẹ aja.
Most people hate going to work.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan korira lilọ si iṣẹ.

It was the only house they had ever known.	O jẹ ile nikan ti wọn ti mọ.

They all sell tea.	Gbogbo wọn ta tii.
If you want to understand them, you need to have them available.	Ti o ba fẹ lati ni oye wọn, o nilo lati ni wọn wa.
Well, it was a way to get past that time.	O dara, o jẹ ọna kan lati kọja akoko naa.
I know my dad helps you from time to time.	Mo mọ pe baba mi ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ lati igba de igba.

Cars need road space.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ nilo aaye opopona.
Essentially, their mother did not accept their reason.	Ni pataki, iya wọn ko gba idi wọn.
He reached for her hand and held her hand.	O de ọwọ rẹ o si mu ọwọ rẹ.
This house of human life, as it were.	Ile yi aye eniyan, bi o ti jẹ.
It includes everything you need to be able to do that.	O pẹlu ohun gbogbo ti o nilo lati ni anfani lati ṣe iyẹn.
I shouldn’t be that way too.	Emi ko yẹ ki o wa ni ọna pupọ.
You have to get up.	O ni lati dide.

Again, a moment is enough.	Lẹẹkansi, akoko kan ti to.
I let them irritate me all the time.	Mo jẹ ki wọn mu mi binu ni gbogbo igba.

Run your hands through your hair.	Ṣiṣe awọn ọwọ rẹ nipasẹ irun ori rẹ.
Start with a question.	Bẹrẹ pẹlu ibeere kan.
This can be a good deal.	Eyi le ṣe adehun daradara.

I think you can insert so.	Mo ro pe o le fi sii bẹ.
I heard that trouble was coming.	Mo gbọ pe wahala n bọ.
You are not even my friend, for the same reason.	Iwọ kii ṣe ọrẹ mi paapaa, fun idi kanna.
The child does not seem to understand the question.	Ọmọ naa ko dabi pe o loye ibeere naa.
I have to be there.	Mo ni lati wa nibẹ.
He was very knowledgeable and did a very good job.	O mọ pupọ o si ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara pupọ.
Invite them to visit your company.	Pe wọn lati ṣabẹwo ile-iṣẹ rẹ.
But how do you do that.	Ṣugbọn bawo ni o ṣe ṣe bẹ.

Much more than that happened.	Pupọ ju iyẹn lọ ṣẹlẹ.

But don't stay there long.	Sugbon ko duro nibẹ gun.
He was very happy when he was in love.	Inu rẹ dun julọ nigbati o wa ninu ifẹ.
So forget about feeling.	Nitorina gbagbe nipa rilara.
Can't believe what he did.	Ko le gbagbọ ohun ti o ṣe.
That helps.	Iyẹn ṣe iranlọwọ.
See what you have done.	Wo ohun ti o ti ṣe.
There we are.	Nibẹ ni a.
Not at all.	Ko jẹ rara.
He hopes they will come to dinner.	O nireti pe wọn yoo wa si ounjẹ alẹ.
But even more importantly, he believed in himself.	Ṣugbọn paapaa pataki julọ, o gbagbọ ninu ararẹ.
That was my situation when your letter arrived.	Iyẹn ni ipo mi nigbati lẹta rẹ de.
Others will not.	Awọn miiran yoo ko.
And that's what it's all about.	Ati awọn ti o ni ohun ti o ni gbogbo nipa.

And don't do it.	Ki o si ma ṣe e.
He has a few friends.	O ni awọn ọrẹ diẹ.
Look at that kind of metal.	Wo iru irin yẹn.
You should at least give it a try.	O yẹ ki o ni o kere fun o kan gbiyanju.
We are already growing and always profitable.	A ti dagba tẹlẹ ati ni ere nigbagbogbo.
Often, the best thing we can do is say nothing.	Nigbagbogbo, ohun ti o dara julọ ti a le ṣe ni lati sọ ohunkohun.
Together they can make any of it work.	Papọ wọn le jẹ ki eyikeyi ninu rẹ ṣiṣẹ.

He must have heard his mother.	O yẹ ki o ti gbọ iya rẹ.
They are a team.	Wọn jẹ ẹgbẹ kan.
He is a person who is not happy to work with.	O jẹ eniyan ti ko dun lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.

Always bathe before bathing.	Nigbagbogbo wẹ ṣaaju ki o to wẹ.
It is not thrown into anything.	A ko sọ ọ sinu ohunkohun.

Many parents refuse to have children.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn obi kọ lati ni awọn ọmọde.
It just won't.	O kan yoo ko.
All children have to do.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọde ni lati ṣe.
You think you have abilities that you may not have.	O ro pe o ni awọn agbara ti o le ma ni.
It was obvious, to me at least.	O ti han gbangba, si mi o kere ju.
I give you my word for that.	Mo fun ọ ni ọrọ mi fun iyẹn.
Send a text.	Fi ọrọ ranṣẹ.
He lifted it up and back and caught fire.	O gbe e soke ati sẹhin ki o fi mu ina.
None of this is important at this time.	Ko si eyi ti o ṣe pataki ni akoko yii.
But they are not for me.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii ṣe fun mi.
I have not seen such a thing in many, many years.	Emi ko tii ri iru nkan bẹẹ ni ọpọlọpọ, ọdun pupọ.

Let me ask now.	Jẹ ki n beere ni bayi.
Of such a.	Ti iru kan.
But it must be alone.	Ṣugbọn o gbọdọ jẹ nikan.
Someone closes the door for someone coming after.	Ẹnikan di ilẹkun fun ẹnikan ti o nbọ lẹhin.
I don’t count for people in the same family.	Emi ko ka fun awọn eniyan ni idile kanna.
Do not try this at home.	Maṣe gbiyanju eyi ni ile.

There is no such situation here.	Ko si iru ipo bayi nibi.
The city refused to move.	Ilu kọ lati gbe.
At this point the game begins.	Ni aaye yii ere bẹrẹ.
But for yourself.	Ṣugbọn fun ara rẹ.
This changed my day.	Eyi yipada ọjọ mi.
It is my favorite drink.	Ohun mimu ayanfẹ mi ni.
They all ate.	Gbogbo rẹ̀ ni wọ́n jẹ.
The child refuses to go to school.	Ọmọ naa kọ lati lọ si ile-iwe.
The house is still standing.	Ile naa tun duro.
He saw the hurt in my eyes.	O ri ipalara ni oju mi.
But it will also be easier to explain away.	Ṣugbọn yoo tun rọrun lati ṣe alaye kuro.
I have to see.	Mo ni lati rii gaan.
If such hard words are used.	Ti a ba lo iru awọn ọrọ lile.
Always in and always will.	Nigbagbogbo ni ati nigbagbogbo yoo.
Not sure what can be done.	Ko daju ohun ti o le ṣee ṣe.
It’s kind of a fast way.	O jẹ iru ọna ti o yara.
I mean, maybe they will.	Mo tumọ si, boya wọn yoo.
People are the same everywhere and we are like everyone else.	Awọn eniyan jẹ kanna nibi gbogbo ati pe a dabi gbogbo eniyan miiran.
One thing is what it is and nothing else.	Ohun kan jẹ ohun ti o jẹ kii ṣe nkan miiran.
They have nothing to do with this place.	Wọn ko fẹ nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu ibi yii.
I would have to get these.	Emi yoo ni lati gba awọn wọnyi.
And they will leave me alone.	Ati pe wọn yoo fi mi silẹ nikan.

It must be at the top of your game.	O gbọdọ wa ni oke ti ere rẹ.
That is better than life.	Pe o dara ju igbesi aye lọ.
Let students notice the letter when they see it in words.	Jẹ ki awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ṣe akiyesi lẹta naa nigbati wọn ba rii ni awọn ọrọ.
Okay, we're here.	O dara, a wa nibi.
They are used on people only if they are dead.	Wọn lo lori eniyan nikan ti o ba ti ku.
It is not a man's house.	Kii ṣe ile ọkunrin.
But we can say more.	Ṣugbọn a le sọ diẹ sii.
Families began rebuilding their homes.	Awọn idile bẹrẹ si tun ile wọn kọ.

You will not believe this.	Iwọ kii yoo gbagbọ eyi.
And you can have.	Ati pe o le ni.

Two good years.	Odun meji to dara.
This time he kept it there.	Ni akoko yii o pa a mọ nibẹ.
They should not do so.	Wọn ko gbọdọ ṣe bẹ.
This is a major concern for two reasons.	Eyi jẹ aniyan pataki fun awọn idi meji.
You know in some.	O mọ ni diẹ ninu awọn.
None of us did, but we should want to.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa ti o ṣe, ṣugbọn o yẹ ki a fẹ lati.
They can always be removed and never come back.	Nigbagbogbo wọn le yọ kuro ati nigbagbogbo ko pada wa.
I'm not feeling well.	Inu mi ko dara gaan.
I would love to talk to you today if you are around.	Emi yoo nifẹ lati ba ọ sọrọ loni ti o ba wa ni ayika.
We are asking for this world.	A n beere fun aye yii.
They live in stressful situations.	Wọn n gbe ni awọn ipo iṣoro.
You learn what to do, or what not to do.	O kọ ẹkọ kini lati ṣe, tabi kini kii ṣe.
The program is not over.	Eto naa ko pari.
It is very wise to do that, especially.	O jẹ ọgbọn pupọ lati ṣe iyẹn, paapaa.
But it was fun !.	Sugbon o je fun!.
Get it and go.	Gba ki o lọ.
They carried me to the side and lifted me back down.	Wọn gbe mi lọ si ẹgbẹ ati gbe mi pada si isalẹ.
It is done.	O ti ṣe.
That is what it is for.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti o wa fun.
I just don’t know how to do that.	Mo kan ko mọ bi a ṣe le ṣe bẹ.
You can not understand.	O ko le loye.
I am able to have this opportunity looking forward to my future.	Mo ni anfani lati ni aaye yii nireti ọjọ iwaju mi.
From a simple tea party, there is a picture.	Lati ayẹyẹ tii ti o rọrun, aworan wa.
She went to the store.	O lọ si ile itaja.
Of course you do.	Dajudaju o ṣe.
It doesn't end well.	Ko pari daradara.
They asked for food.	Wọn beere ounjẹ.
That is here now.	Ti o wa nibi ni bayi.
Sorry they don't seem to be receiving my letters.	Ma binu pe wọn ko dabi pe wọn n gba awọn lẹta mi.
I deserve to drive it.	Mo yẹ lati wakọ rẹ.
In fact, they have nothing.	Ni otitọ, wọn ko ni nkan kankan.
Not everyone is told until next month.	A ko sọ fun gbogbo eniyan titi di oṣu ti n bọ.
I don’t see why they would.	Emi ko rii idi ti wọn yoo.
One look was enough.	Ọkan wo wà to.
That was an unexpected feeling to have.	Iyẹn jẹ rilara ti ko nireti lati ni.
There is no possible reason.	Ko si idi ti o ṣeeṣe.
A police car has stopped nearby.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ọlọpa ti duro nitosi.
Or, the car could be a problem.	Tabi, ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ le jẹ iṣoro.
Not many of them.	Ko si pupọ ninu wọn.
He remembers how it was yesterday.	O ranti bi o ti ri lana.
Lunch is now over.	Ounjẹ ọsan ti pari bayi.
It’s a whole game.	O jẹ ere gbogbo.
You know little you can see.	O mọ kekere ti o le rii.
I'm happy now.	Inu mi dun bayi.
That's for sure.	Iyẹn daju.
I have to stay in pairs.	Mo ni lati duro ni meji.
That means working at night to finish the thing.	Iyẹn tumọ si ṣiṣẹ ni alẹ lati pari nkan naa.
And he waited enough to marry her.	Ati ki o si duro to lati fẹ u.
It doesn’t feel like work.	Ko lero bi iṣẹ.
But, of course that doesn’t mean anything to anyone else.	Ṣugbọn, dajudaju iyẹn ko tumọ si ohunkohun si ẹnikẹni miiran.
Consider the trees rose.	Ro awọn igi dide.
And yet they are very important to me.	Ati sibẹsibẹ wọn ṣe pataki pupọ fun mi.
A hot.	A gbona.
But he and I were the only ones in the room.	Ṣugbọn oun ati emi nikan lo wa ninu yara naa.
I want you by my side and on my bed.	Mo fẹ ọ ni ẹgbẹ mi ati lori ibusun mi.
She loves to help.	O nifẹ lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
For myself, for my team.	Fun ara mi, fun ẹgbẹ mi.
He is a child.	Ọmọde ni.
I will do the work.	Emi yoo ṣe iṣẹ naa.
We'll see what you have.	A yoo rii ohun ti o ni.
He looked, but saw nothing beyond.	O wo, ṣugbọn ko ri ohunkohun kọja.
They did not say where they were taken.	Won ko so ibi ti won ti gbe won lo.
They do not know that your brother is watching,	Wọn ko mọ pe arakunrin rẹ n wo,
He sat up.	O joko soke.
You know how they go.	O mọ bi wọn ṣe lọ.
Something is there.	Nkankan wa nibẹ.
Whatever your best work is, you do.	Ohunkohun ti iṣẹ rẹ ti o dara julọ jẹ, o ṣe.
It is important to know that you are not alone.	O ṣe pataki lati mọ pe iwọ kii ṣe nikan.
We did it.	A ṣe e.
This is for the best.	Eleyi jẹ fun awọn ti o dara ju.
But that is a mistake.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn jẹ aṣiṣe.
I waited for him to say something.	Mo duro fun u lati sọ nkankan.
At first he saw nothing.	Ni akọkọ ko ri nkankan.
He is an amazing person and many will miss.	O jẹ eniyan iyanu ati pe ọpọlọpọ yoo padanu.
Just get out of it and move on to love.	Kan jade kuro ninu rẹ ki o gbe lọ si ifẹ.
At one point someone turned the music up.	Ni aaye kan ẹnikan yi orin soke.
The same button can be used to change conditions.	Bọtini kanna le ṣee lo lati yi awọn ipo pada.
Something, someone was there with him.	Nkankan, ẹnikan wa nibẹ pẹlu rẹ.
This is understandable.	Eyi ni oye.
How do we make cars more energy efficient?	Bawo ni a ṣe jẹ ki awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wa ni agbara diẹ sii daradara?
He looked at the girl.	O wo ọmọbirin naa.
You want this to be the first test.	O fẹ ki eyi jẹ idanwo akọkọ.
The tree is usually small.	Igi naa maa n jẹ kekere.
I don’t deserve to remember them now.	Emi ko yẹ lati ranti wọn ni bayi.
These girls are not possible.	Awọn ọmọbirin wọnyi ko ṣeeṣe.
Would have killed many of us.	Yoo ti pa ọpọlọpọ awọn ti wa.
Whatever they may say, you know who you are.	Ohunkohun ti wọn le sọ, o mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
You will see for yourself how real it is.	Iwọ yoo rii ara rẹ bi o ṣe jẹ gaan.
She wanted to be one of her daughters.	O fẹ di ọkan ninu awọn ọmọbirin rẹ.
I can't seem to get away with it.	Emi ko le dabi lati yọ kuro.
It's too hot.	O gbona ju.
The same thing is happening in other companies.	Awọn ohun kanna n ṣẹlẹ ni awọn ile-iṣẹ miiran.
Some would say this is a mistake.	Diẹ ninu awọn yoo sọ pe eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
He could not know anything about this.	Ko le mo nkankan nipa yi.
Winter is a difficult time for most people.	Igba otutu jẹ akoko ti o nira fun ọpọlọpọ eniyan.
Things have changed a lot.	Awọn nkan ti yipada pupọ.
I can work on it.	Mo le ṣiṣẹ lori rẹ.
Didn't find anything.	Ko ri nkankan.
The promise worked.	Ileri naa ṣiṣẹ.
Turn it back on us.	Yipada rẹ pada si wa.
They can't see.	Wọn ko le rii.
Everyone is really laughing.	Gbogbo eniyan n rẹrin gaan.
We started to talk.	A bẹrẹ lati sọrọ.
He hasn't sold a picture in a while.	Ko tii ta aworan kan ni igba diẹ.
Of course, you can go out and buy one.	Dajudaju, o le jade lọ ra ọkan.
But one day when they had worked everything out.	Ṣugbọn ni ọjọ kan nigbati wọn ti ṣiṣẹ ohun gbogbo jade.
That no one understands.	Iyẹn ni ko si ẹnikan ti o loye.
We are not given.	A ko fun ni.
So don’t be about.	Nitorina maṣe jẹ nipa.
Nice to meet you.	Inu re dun lati pade mi.
Have to give it a good cleaning.	Ni lati fun o kan ti o dara ninu.
More than you say.	O ju bi o ti sọ lọ.
They are in the morning.	Wọn wa ni owurọ.
This is more than just a song.	Eyi jẹ diẹ sii ju orin kan lọ.
I am back home.	Mo ti pada si ile.
I could see he didn't want to get up.	Mo le rii pe ko fẹ dide.
Remember the rule.	Ranti ofin naa.
There is no time to pull away.	Ko si akoko lati fa kuro.
Her hair is on her face.	Irun rẹ wa ni oju rẹ.
You have been working on them for a while now.	O ti ṣiṣẹ lori wọn fun igba diẹ bayi.
But you can't take him out of the house.	Ṣugbọn o ko le mu u jade kuro ni ile.
No more words about it.	Ko si awọn ọrọ diẹ sii nipa rẹ.
The car is their life.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa jẹ igbesi aye wọn.
I have not changed in any way.	Emi ko yipada ni eyikeyi ọna.
It doesn't really make any sense.	O ko ni gan ṣe eyikeyi ori.
No one said a word about them.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ọrọ kan nipa wọn.
You deserve the money completely.	O tọ si owo naa patapata.
They let you know.	Wọn jẹ ki o mọ.
Need some help.	Nilo iranlọwọ diẹ.
I do not know what the value was.	Emi ko mo ohun ti iye ti o wà.
We can start again.	A le bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
He looked up.	O wo soke.
Where you can’t find them you make them.	Ibi ti ko le ri wọn o ṣe wọn.
So your name can be heard and praised.	Nitorina orukọ rẹ le dun jade ki a si yin.
That of course needs attention.	Iyẹn dajudaju nilo akiyesi.
But they can and should.	Ṣugbọn wọn le ati pe o yẹ.
So it can be done.	Nitorina o le ṣee ṣe.
He can not know.	Ko le mọ.
However the weeks passed.	Sibẹsibẹ awọn ọsẹ kọja.
What time do they close?	akoko wo ni wọn pari?
But they have songs.	Ṣugbọn wọn ni awọn orin.
What on earth did you become what you became?	Kini lori ile aye ti o ṣe ohun ti o di?
He stood up.	O dide duro.
You have never heard of something like this before.	O ko gbọ ohun ti o dun bi eleyi tẹlẹ.
He died of his injuries.	O ti ku nitori ipalara rẹ.
I want to hear more of your story.	Mo fẹ lati gbọ diẹ sii ti itan tirẹ.
The river rose.	Awọn odo dide.
I love my friends, my brother.	Mo nifẹ awọn ọrẹ mi, arakunrin mi.
That is your strength.	Agbara re niyen.
The two boys are great.	Awọn ọmọkunrin meji jẹ nla.
All the more reason to give him any information you can.	Gbogbo idi diẹ sii lati fun u ni alaye eyikeyi ti o le.
A room was transformed into an office.	Yara kan ti yipada si ọfiisi kan.
I got up and hurried for a while.	Mo dide ki o si yara fun igba diẹ.
And take your hand away from me.	Ki o si gba ọwọ rẹ kuro lori mi.
You have done nothing wrong.	O ti ṣe ohunkohun ti ko tọ.
Anything you can touch, or feel, is a matter.	Ohunkohun ti o le fi ọwọ kan, tabi rilara, jẹ ọrọ.
Everyone, sit down.	Gbogbo eniyan, e joko.
My advice is to just drink one day at a time.	Imọran mi ni lati kan mu ni ọjọ kan ni akoko kan.
That means it belongs to you.	Iyẹn tumọ si pe o jẹ tirẹ.
And you know that everyone else is looking at yourself too.	Ati pe o mọ pe gbogbo eniyan miiran n wo ara rẹ paapaa.
Only words.	Awọn ọrọ nikan ni.
At first this may seem a little weird.	Ni akọkọ eyi le dabi iyalẹnu diẹ.
The program can go both ways.	Eto naa le lọ ni ọna mejeeji.
Maybe he was human after all.	Boya o jẹ eniyan lẹhin gbogbo.
After my seat.	Lẹhin ijoko mi.
Can someone tell me how to do it.	Njẹ ẹnikan le sọ fun mi bi o ṣe le ṣe.
He could not live without his music.	Ko le gbe laisi orin rẹ.
For more.	Fun diẹ.
I'm afraid you can.	Mo bẹru pe o le.
The other two have fallen out of clothing.	Awọn meji miiran ti lọ silẹ lati aṣọ.
We must accept.	A gbọdọ gba.
I am with a friend and his parents.	Mo wa pẹlu ọrẹ kan ati awọn obi rẹ.
Just hear others talk about it.	O kan gbọ awọn miiran sọrọ nipa rẹ.
And walk on the sides.	Ki o si rin lori awọn ẹgbẹ.
Everything is it, and that is everything.	Ohun gbogbo ni o, ati awọn ti o jẹ ohun gbogbo.
She went to the doctor last week.	O lọ si dokita ni ọsẹ to kọja.
Only one place.	Ibi kan nikan.
The sister was angry.	Arabinrin naa binu.
In fact, he does not like men.	Ni otitọ, ko fẹran awọn ọkunrin.
He has no problem with that understanding.	Ko ni iṣoro pẹlu oye yẹn.
When not hot.	Nigbati ko ba gbona.
With great determination, he put himself on his feet.	Pẹlu ipinnu nla, o fi ara rẹ si ẹsẹ rẹ.
We do that to give ourselves a place in life.	A ṣe iyẹn lati fun ara wa ni aye.
I would never really have done that of course.	Emi yoo ko gan ti ṣe ti o dajudaju.
I have never been afraid in my life.	Emi ko tii bẹru rara ni igbesi aye mi.
Supermarkets are growing.	Awọn ile itaja nla n dagba.
It is obvious.	O ti wa ni han gbangba.
That is such a mistake.	Iyẹn jẹ iru aṣiṣe kan.
It will take a few minutes.	Yoo gba to iṣẹju diẹ.
We'll let you go home.	A yoo jẹ ki o lọ si ile.
Now you have to eat.	Bayi o gbọdọ jẹun.
He is not a man.	Oun kii ṣe eniyan.
He was warm and loved to laugh.	O gbona o nifẹ lati rẹrin.
A few years ago.	Ni ọdun diẹ sẹhin.
Love, love, love it.	Nifẹ, ifẹ, nifẹ rẹ.
It has captured my attention of course.	O ti gba akiyesi mi dajudaju.
Keep your feet straight.	Gbe ẹsẹ rẹ tọ.
I love the way it looks.	Mo nifẹ ọna ti o dabi.
Does anyone know for sure.	Ṣe ẹnikẹni mọ daju.
I think of my friends, and think hard.	Mo ro ti awọn ọrẹ mi, ati ki o ro gidigidi.
Nothing seemed to surprise them anymore.	Ko si ohun ti o dabi enipe ohun iyanu wọn mọ.
But we are not going to look beyond them.	Ṣugbọn a ko lilọ lati wo kọja wọn.
The more you can do, the better.	Bi o ṣe le ṣe diẹ sii, dara julọ.
What did you see when you looked at me?	Kini o ri nigbati o wo mi?
In others, it is not.	Ni awọn miiran, kii ṣe.
Make up your mind.	Ṣe awọn ero rẹ.
It is obvious to see that they are in love.	O han gbangba lati rii pe wọn wa ninu ifẹ.
No, that will not work.	Rara, iyẹn kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
I do not really understand.	Emi ko loye gaan.
He will not go back.	Oun ko ni pada sẹhin.
Just sit there.	O kan joko nibẹ.
You have to try and stay in the shoes of the players.	O ni lati gbiyanju ati duro ni awọn bata ti awọn ẹrọ orin.
Living with mom, she works at night.	Ngbe pẹlu iya, o ṣiṣẹ ni alẹ.
Ko ku.	Ko ku.
It is not a rule that men should do so.	Kii ṣe ofin ti awọn ọkunrin yẹ ki o ṣe bẹ.
He doesn't like that word.	Ko fẹran ọrọ yẹn.
For an hour.	Fun wakati kan.
I still do not live.	Mo si tun ko gbe.
Very tasty.	Gan daradara dun.
So we are in good hands.	Nitorina a wa ni ọwọ ti o dara.
I will contact myself.	Emi yoo kan si ara mi.
I love love.	Mo nifẹ ifẹ.
And it just is great.	Ati pe o kan jẹ nla.
In this.	Ninu eyi.
Maybe they are better not to use.	Boya wọn dara julọ lati ma lo.
He wants you to go and see him.	O fẹ ki o lọ wo oun.
Some other material.	Diẹ ninu awọn ohun elo miiran.
Something went wrong.	Nkankan ti ko tọ ninu.
The classes are both educational and easy to use.	Awọn kilasi jẹ mejeeji ẹkọ ati rọrun lati lo.
Remember you were there for a day.	Ranti pe o wa nibẹ fun ọjọ kan.
I can talk to anyone.	Mo le sọrọ si ẹnikẹni.
I do not believe them.	Emi ko gbagbọ wọn.
No more ideas.	Ko si awọn ero diẹ sii.
Everyone wants that.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o fẹ bẹ.
He is not a morning person.	Oun kii ṣe eniyan owurọ.
I hope you all have had a great week.	Mo nireti pe gbogbo yin ti ni ọsẹ nla kan.
I wouldn’t even wait to get anything to eat.	Emi yoo ko duro paapaa lati gba ohunkohun lati jẹ.
I have no understanding of it.	Emi ko ni oye ninu rẹ.
Everything needs to change.	Ohun gbogbo nilo lati yipada.
We have to get these other people.	A ni lati gba awọn eniyan miiran wọnyi.
What do you say you call.	Kini o sọ pe o pe.
No one will notice even that you are gone, baby.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo ṣe akiyesi paapaa pe o ti lọ, ọmọ.
We can only wait and see.	A le nikan duro ati ki o wo.
How nice to call.	Bawo ni o dara lati pe.
O lu jade.	O lu jade.
He could not get them back.	Ko le gba wọn pada.
Please leave your first name and a question.	Jọwọ fi orukọ akọkọ rẹ silẹ ati ibeere kan.
There can be nothing more than that.	O le ko si nkankan ju iyẹn lọ.
But it is not a job.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe iṣẹ kan.
But things are about to change.	Ṣugbọn awọn nkan le fẹrẹ yipada.
I was out of everything.	Mo ti jade ninu ohun gbogbo.
They need help.	Wọn nilo iranlọwọ.
I can find information with the best of them.	Mo ti le ri alaye pẹlu awọn ti o dara ju ninu wọn.
You should get that idea as soon as you get your head around it.	O yẹ ki o gba ero yẹn ni kete ti ori rẹ.
Below is a snapshot of the final image.	Ni isalẹ ni aworan ti aworan ikẹhin.
It is getting cold.	O ti n di otutu.
You should be at home.	O yẹ ki o wa ni ile.
In the plans are made.	Ni awọn eto ti wa ni ṣe.
That’s not much.	Iyẹn kii ṣe pupọ.
The dog of the house is the best friend of man.	Aja ti ile jẹ ọrẹ to dara julọ ti eniyan.
Not to be happy, or to love.	Ko lati dun si, tabi lati nifẹ.
He started the car.	O bẹrẹ ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
And it's simple.	Ati pe o rọrun.
While place is important.	Nigba ti ibi jẹ pataki.
I'm not sorry, just happy.	Emi ko binu, o kan dun.
He looked like that man.	O dabi ọkunrin yẹn.
Something is wrong here.	Nkankan ko tọ nibi.
It just works like that.	O kan ṣiṣẹ bi iyẹn.
And it’s all coming soon.	Ati pe gbogbo rẹ n bọ laipẹ.
See the text.	Wo ọrọ naa.
But can not install it.	Sugbon ko le fi o.
Do not forget to buy bread at the last minute.	Maṣe gbagbe lati ra akara ni iṣẹju to kẹhin.
I gave him the run of it.	Mo fun u ni ṣiṣe ti o.
He sang.	O kọ orin.
Not just you and me.	Kii ṣe iwọ ati emi nikan.
It was my time.	O je akoko mi.
You do not have to use them.	O ko ni lati lo wọn.
It will get to you.	O yoo gba si o.
You know better than that.	O mọ ju iyẹn lọ.
Many students said they liked the new teacher.	Pupọ awọn ọmọ ile-iwe sọ pe wọn fẹran olukọ tuntun naa.
It changed.	O yi pada.
I have money.	Mo ni owo.
That's trying.	Iyẹn n gbiyanju.
People's clothing has changed over time.	Aṣọ eniyan ti yipada ni akoko pupọ.
So many other things.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan miiran.
The rain came early this year.	Ojo ti de ni kutukutu odun yii.
The boys also did it.	Awọn ọmọkunrin tun ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
I did not ask him why.	Emi ko beere lọwọ rẹ idi.
You want the same feeling for a long time.	O fẹ rilara kanna fun igba pipẹ.
This is our man, and he has given his work to the team.	Eyi ni eniyan wa, o si ti fi iṣẹ rẹ fun ẹgbẹ naa.
Just wait and see where it comes from.	O kan duro ki o wo ibiti o ti de.
We forgot, you see.	A gbagbe, o ri.
We are not sure that we knew as early as we were talking.	Ko da wa loju pe a mọ ni kutukutu bi a ti n sọrọ.
Cross the road.	Kọja si ọna.
Don't say.	Maṣe sọ.
I think it's too late.	Mo ro pe o ti pẹ ju.
They always have a big problem.	Wọn nigbagbogbo ni iṣoro nla.
I do not need to continue.	Emi ko nilo lati tẹsiwaju.
I just have to stop.	Mo kan ni lati da.
Something will take its place.	Nkankan yoo gba ipo rẹ.
I would hate to miss it too.	Emi yoo korira lati padanu rẹ paapaa.
But most days it is not like that.	Ṣugbọn ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọjọ kii ṣe bii eyi.
I'll talk.	Emi yoo sọrọ.
I like that in a woman.	Mo fẹran iyẹn ninu obinrin kan.
He could not do anything else.	Ko le ṣe ohunkohun miiran.
He may even see you here.	O le paapaa rii ọ ni ibi.
Too much to come.	Ju ni lati wa.
I would like maybe one that will help me.	Emi yoo fẹ boya ọkan ti yoo ran mi lọwọ.
You will not be able to contact up.	O yoo ko ni anfani lati kan soke.
It’s team work.	O jẹ iṣẹ ẹgbẹ.
We got everything we needed.	A ri ohun gbogbo ti a nilo.
You do not miss a cut.	O ko padanu a ge.
Over time, it becomes cold.	Lori akoko, o di otutu.
The water is hot.	Omi naa gbona.
At least by me.	O kere ju nipasẹ mi.
It does not leave room for you.	Ko fi aaye silẹ fun ọ.
Those two things are very important.	Awọn nkan meji yẹn jẹ pataki pupọ.
At first it was just something to do.	Ni igba akọkọ ti o kan nkankan lati se.
His words are hard to understand.	Ọrọ rẹ jẹ gidigidi lati ni oye.
We tell stories.	A sọ awọn itan.
Get this for him.	Gba eyi fun u.
That is a good point.	Iyẹn jẹ aaye to dara.
Bad things happen when people feel left out.	Awọn ohun buburu n ṣẹlẹ nigbati awọn eniyan ba lero pe a ti fi wọn silẹ.
They can't open the box.	Wọn ko le ṣii apoti naa.
You have a similar situation here.	O ni iru ipo kan nibi.
And it started well.	Ati pe o bẹrẹ daradara.
What is in your heart is.	Ohun ti o wa ninu ọkan rẹ ni.
Look someone in the eye.	Wo ẹnikan ni oju.
I may need to move some things around again.	Mo le nilo lati tun gbe awọn nkan diẹ ni ayika lẹẹkansi.
Maybe you should see a doctor or something.	Boya o yẹ ki o wo dokita kan tabi nkankan.
We have children.	A ni awọn ọmọde.
All of which is great.	Gbogbo awọn ti o jẹ nla.
He is watching.	O n wo.
Or maybe not.	Tabi boya kii ṣe bẹ.
In the book.	Ninu iwe.
Get over it, you lose.	Gba lori rẹ, o padanu.
That's what he did.	Ohun ti o ṣe niyẹn.
They go out.	Wọn jade.
My beautiful son is dead.	Ọmọkunrin mi lẹwa ti ku.
I mean no one can touch them.	Mo tumọ si pe ko si ẹnikan ti o le fi ọwọ kan wọn.
Very small space.	Aye kekere pupọ.
Children are not good for me.	Awọn ọmọde ko dara fun mi.
There is no way to look good on this.	Ko si ọna lati fi oju ti o dara si eyi.
But there were other people on the roof of the car.	Ṣugbọn awọn eniyan miiran wa lori oke ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
I can't wait.	Mi le duro.
It is going to last.	O ti wa ni lilọ lati gun.
He is behind us.	O wa lẹhin wa.
There are three women.	Awọn obinrin mẹta wa.
Here is another story you will enjoy.	Eyi ni itan miiran ti iwọ yoo gbadun.
Someone is looking down.	Ẹnikan n wo isalẹ.
He tells you that and that is what you are doing.	O sọ fun ọ pe ati pe ohun ti o n ṣe niyẹn.
He did not think.	O ko ronu.
Write it if you want.	Kọ o ti o ba fẹ.
Everything is known to you.	Ohun gbogbo ti mọ fun ọ.
I just play football and run.	Mo kan mu bọọlu ati ṣiṣe.
Our brother is old enough to drive now.	Arakunrin wa ti dagba to lati wakọ ni bayi.
The fire was burning through the building.	Ina ti njẹ nipasẹ ile naa.
It depends on what else you want as well.	O da lori ohun miiran ti o fẹ bi daradara.
You know, of course.	O mọ, dajudaju.
You can not feel it coming.	O ko le lero pe o nbọ.
Do not hit people.	Maṣe lu eniyan.
Often, it’s how they go about it.	Nigbagbogbo, o jẹ bi wọn ṣe lọ nipa rẹ.
I think you do, too.	Mo ro pe o ṣe, paapaa.
It only takes an hour.	Yoo gba to wakati kan nikan.
Others see it in other ways.	Awọn miiran rii ni awọn ọna miiran.
Change my life.	Yi aye mi pada.
Tell me what’s happening to me.	Sọ ohun ti n ṣẹlẹ fun mi.
I'm glad to have it.	Inu mi dun lati ni i.
At first there was no one there.	Ni akọkọ ko si ẹnikan nibẹ.
It doesn't look like that.	Ko dabi iru.
She has a son.	O ni ọmọkunrin kan.
It’s time for people to do the right thing.	O to akoko fun eniyan lati ṣe ohun ti o tọ.
But he gave her this advice.	Ṣugbọn o fun u ni imọran yii.
Say a few more.	Sọ diẹ diẹ.
But he is on our side.	Ṣugbọn o wa ni ẹgbẹ wa.
Your tone is not good.	Ohun orin rẹ ko dara.
Pull to Hold.	Fa lati Mu.
My children are lost.	Awọn ọmọ mi padanu.
He knew there was not much.	O mọ pe ko si pupọ.
I finished one book and started another.	Mo pari iwe kan mo si bẹrẹ miiran.
It’s time to do things.	O to akoko lati ṣe awọn nkan.
He, the team.	Oun, ẹgbẹ naa.
Many people have died here.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ti ku nibi.
I want to know everything about it.	Mo fẹ lati mọ ohun gbogbo nipa rẹ.
I deserve to hear.	Mo yẹ lati gbọ.
He got back in his car and left.	O pada sinu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ rẹ o si lọ.
Parents to treat.	Awọn obi lati tọju.
Everyone lost a big money.	Gbogbo padanu owo nla kan.
He would not have wanted to be noticed.	Oun kii yoo ti fẹ lati ṣe akiyesi.
I asked my students to write down a few things.	Mo beere awọn ọmọ ile-iwe mi lati kọ awọn nkan diẹ silẹ.
They are taught to move, not to pass.	Wọn kọ wọn lati gbe, kii ṣe lati kọja.
I can find people who love it.	Mo le rii awọn eniyan ti o nifẹ rẹ.
Many citizens lost their jobs when the company closed.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ara ilu padanu iṣẹ wọn nigbati ile-iṣẹ naa ti pa.
At first, nothing was as simple as it seemed.	Ni akọkọ, ko si ohun ti o rọrun bi o ṣe dabi.
You want to see someone.	O fẹ ri ẹnikan.
They are very good.	Wọn dara julọ.
But we can live without them.	Ṣugbọn a le gbe laisi wọn.
I don't want anything out of the house.	Emi ko fẹ ohunkohun jade ninu ile.
Weather conditions are constantly changing.	Awọn ipo oju ojo n yipada nigbagbogbo.
I do not know whether what you read is true or not.	Emi ko mọ boya ohun ti o ka jẹ otitọ tabi rara.
It's just not possible.	O kan ko ṣee ṣe.
So we started school.	Nitorina a bẹrẹ ile-iwe.
It can happen to anyone at any time.	O le ṣẹlẹ si ẹnikẹni ni eyikeyi akoko.
Do whatever it takes.	Ṣe ohunkohun ti o gba.
He did not look anxious.	O ko wo aniyan.
One of the many small benefits of the project.	Ọkan ninu ọpọlọpọ awọn anfani kekere ti iṣẹ naa.
But it does mean something better.	Ṣugbọn o tumọ fun ohun ti o dara julọ.
At least not before the last letter from home.	O kere ju ko ṣaaju lẹta ti o kẹhin lati ile.
Will miss everyone’s time.	Yoo padanu akoko gbogbo eniyan.
But we know what happened in the past.	Ṣugbọn a mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni igba atijọ.
Out with friends.	Jade pẹlu awọn ọrẹ.
I do not understand for the moment, space.	Emi ko ni oye fun akoko, aaye.
The car will blow up.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yoo fẹ soke.
But that doesn’t matter.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣe pataki.
Let me get back to that.	Jẹ ki n pada si iyẹn.
I'm worried about it.	Mo n ṣe aniyan nipa rẹ.
I know you mean.	Mo mọ pe o tumọ si.
They forgot it again.	Wọn ti gbagbe rẹ lẹẹkansi.
Now, let’s look at what’s in it.	Bayi, jẹ ki a wo ohun ti o wa ninu.
It does not matter much.	Ko ṣe pataki pupọ.
They stood in the back of the room.	Wọn duro ni ẹhin yara naa.
In fact, people left them.	Ni otitọ, awọn eniyan fi wọn silẹ.
Not available.	Ko wa.
Sorry to delay.	Ma binu lati pẹ.
Which you have to, with this great thing.	Eyi ti o ni lati, pẹlu nkan nla yii.
None of these methods got me a job.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ọna wọnyi ti o gba mi ni iṣẹ kan.
And it needs heat.	Ati pe o nilo ooru.
I went to my room.	Mo lọ si yara mi.
We need to work soon.	A nilo lati ṣiṣẹ laipẹ.
You have your meeting.	O ni ipade rẹ.
Very good for me.	O dara pupọ fun mi.
We will have more to say about that below.	A yoo ni diẹ sii lati sọ nipa iyẹn ni isalẹ.
And that shouldn’t be.	Ati pe iyẹn ko yẹ.
He tried to wait until his wife returned.	O gbiyanju lati duro titi iyawo rẹ yoo fi pada.
Don't forget that.	Maṣe gbagbe iyẹn.
His work, however, was not without its problems.	Iṣẹ rẹ, sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe laisi awọn iṣoro rẹ.
They have left the house.	Wọn ti kuro ni ile.
He waited for a few minutes, surprised.	O duro fun iṣẹju diẹ, o ya.
I will not lose my life.	Nko ni fi emi mi nu le e.
I have seen more like it.	Mo ti rii diẹ bi rẹ.
The river is beautiful.	Odo jẹ lẹwa.
And others, and they will travel with dogs.	Ati awọn miiran, ati pe wọn yoo rin irin-ajo pẹlu awọn aja.
This can happen to anyone with you.	Eyi le ṣẹlẹ si ẹnikẹni pẹlu iwọ.
Can't find them.	Ko le ri wọn.
They live together.	Wọn gbe papọ.
You can not exist on your own.	O ko le tẹlẹ lori ara rẹ.
There is a lot to sort out here.	Nibẹ ni a pupo lati to awọn jade nibi.
We do not agree with this point.	A ko gba pẹlu aaye yii.
Doctor, help!	Dokita, iranlọwọ!
I'll be here to listen.	Emi yoo wa nibi lati gbọ.
I love it so much.	Mo nifẹ rẹ pupọ.
They made a very tasty meal.	Wọn ṣe ounjẹ ti o dun pupọ.
Outside the law.	Ita ofin.
Are you afraid of dogs?	Ṣe o bẹru awọn aja?
I could probably be that in one go, you thought to yourself.	Mo ti le jasi jẹ pe ni ọkan lọ, o ro si ara rẹ.
I don't want to take it anymore.	Emi ko fẹ lati mu u mọ.
We do, however.	A ṣe, sibẹsibẹ.
I did for a few minutes.	Mo ṣe fun iṣẹju diẹ.
Or he will come back.	Tabi oun yoo pada wa.
I know the thought.	Mo mọ ronu naa.
None of that.	Ko si ọkan ninu iyẹn.
The text is too small for me to read.	Ọrọ naa kere pupọ fun mi lati ka.
He was killed in a car accident.	O ti pa ninu ijamba ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
She hates it now, she’s convinced.	O korira rẹ bayi, o ni idaniloju.
When do we start?	Nigbawo ni a yoo bẹrẹ?
A winter world.	A igba otutu aye.
I was worried they could reach you.	Mo ṣe aniyan pe wọn le de ọdọ rẹ.
It’s a beautiful little thing.	O jẹ nkan kekere ti o lẹwa.
You have come to see how it should be.	O ti wa lati rii bi o ti yẹ.
More people go to town every year.	Awọn eniyan diẹ sii n lọ si ilu ni gbogbo ọdun.
By the time you saw it, you knew it was important.	Ni akoko ti o rii, o mọ pe o ṣe pataki.
He even called his mother.	Paapaa o pe iya rẹ.
He had lost his life to return.	O ti padanu aye rẹ lati pada.
So, you start your vacation.	Nitorina, o bẹrẹ isinmi rẹ.
No one said a word.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ọrọ kan.
We live by bread.	A n gbe nipasẹ akara.
It is the best place to be.	O jẹ ibi ti o dara julọ lati wa.
I took them.	Mo mu wọn.
On the day of the picture.	Ni ọjọ aworan naa.
Not allowed.	Ko gba laaye.
Spend some time with some of them.	Lo akoko diẹ pẹlu diẹ ninu wọn.
That way soon you have something of an education.	Ni ọna yẹn laipẹ o ni nkan ti ẹkọ.
We pulled up in front of a big house.	A fa soke ni iwaju ile nla kan.
That is something we need to pay more attention to.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti a ni lati fun akiyesi diẹ si.
Not for him.	Ko si fun u.
He asked for a hearty breakfast.	O beere fun ounjẹ ounjẹ ounjẹ kan.
I have to stay there.	Mo ni lati duro nibẹ.
But do not say or do anything.	Ṣugbọn maṣe sọ tabi ṣe ohunkohun.
We hold hands.	A di ọwọ mu.
Now it is personal.	Bayi o jẹ ti ara ẹni.
Not on the station.	Ko si lori ibudo naa.
If you do not ask them in the future.	Ti o ko ba beere wọn ni ojo iwaju.
I was here first!	Mo wa nibi ni akọkọ!
There is no other reason.	Ko si idi miiran.
His name is always in the book.	Orukọ rẹ nigbagbogbo wa ninu iwe naa.
Both make a lot of money.	Awọn mejeeji ṣe ọpọlọpọ owo.
That was a while ago.	Iyẹn jẹ igba diẹ sẹhin.
I want you .	Mo fẹ ọ .
He asked if he was single.	O beere boya o ko ni iyawo.
I know you don’t feel it, but it’s true.	Mo mọ pe o ko lero, ṣugbọn o jẹ otitọ.
He drank a cup of tea.	O mu ife tii kan.
It is summer and winter.	O wa ni igba ooru ati igba otutu.
I did nothing!	Emi ko ṣe ohunkohun!
Take it here.	Gbe e de ibi.
I was not able to figure it out.	Emi ko ni anfani lati ro ero rẹ.
They have gone without shoes many times.	Wọn ti lọ laisi bata ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
And you tell him you will sell everything.	Ati pe o sọ fun u pe iwọ yoo ta ohun gbogbo.
It is important and you know it.	O jẹ pataki ati pe o mọ ọ.
As you have done many times before.	Bi o ti ṣe ni ọpọlọpọ igba ṣaaju ki o to.
I know them well.	Mo mọ wọn daradara.
It just always seems harmful.	O kan nigbagbogbo dabi ipalara.
I never tried.	Nko gbiyanju rara.
It did a lot more than was required.	O ṣe pupọ diẹ sii ju bi a ti beere lọ.
About what you believe.	Nipa awọn ohun ti o gbagbọ.
It's a great year.	Odun nla ni.
My hand stays in your hair.	Ọwọ mi duro ninu irun rẹ.
I love to wear in the summer.	Mo nifẹ lati wọ ni igba ooru.
All by yourself.	Gbogbo funrararẹ.
He washed his hands before starting.	O fo ọwọ rẹ ṣaaju ki o to bẹrẹ.
He'd not believe what he heard.	O fẹ ko gbagbọ ohun ti o gbọ.
The fact that it happened is not news.	Otitọ pe o ṣẹlẹ kii ṣe iroyin.
I read your book.	Mo ka iwe rẹ.
Some things happen.	Diẹ ninu awọn nkan ṣẹlẹ.
He lost his way.	O padanu ọna.
Outside you can’t see much to say for yourself.	Ni ita ti o ko le ri Elo lati sọ fun ara rẹ.
None of his friends.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
When did this class meet again? 	Nigbawo ni kilasi yii tun pade?
we can not go.	a ko le lọ.
It was about help.	O je nipa iranlọwọ.
Both are true.	Awọn mejeeji jẹ otitọ.
He said he wanted to see it again and again and again.	O sọ pe o fẹ lati rii lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
I was really into it for a while.	Mo ti wà gan sinu o fun a nigba ti.
Some of my teachers have been very important to me.	Diẹ ninu awọn olukọ mi ti ṣe pataki fun mi gaan.
It is important that the water is not too hot.	O ṣe pataki ki omi ko gbona ju.
There is nothing we can do.	Ko si ohun ti a le se.
We have an agreement.	A ni adehun.
The name of the place is so beautiful it says it all.	Orukọ ibi naa lẹwa pupọ sọ gbogbo rẹ.
It is a negotiated agreement.	O jẹ adehun ti o ti pari.
I am in my wisdom finished with it.	Mo wa ni awọn ọgbọn mi pari pẹlu rẹ.
Nothing is given.	Ko si ohun ti a fun.
But not for the husband.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe fun ọkọ.
I found that one.	Mo ti ri pe ọkan.
They are gone.	Wọn ti kọja.
I just can't reach them.	Mi o kan ko le de ọdọ wọn.
I will take the train today.	Emi yoo gba ọkọ oju irin loni.
They can change it and delete it as they wish.	Wọn le yi pada ki o si pa a bi wọn ṣe fẹ.
I am glad that I was invited to this party.	Inu mi dun pe a ti pe mi si ibi ayẹyẹ yii.
Cars should be available throughout the area.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ yẹ ki o wa ni gbogbo agbegbe.
Kind of bad.	Iru buburu.
Oh my gosh.	O ya mi paapaa.
You do not know.	O ko mọ.
It was that time of year again.	O jẹ akoko yẹn ti ọdun lẹẹkansi.
Think everything will take longer than you think.	Ro pe ohun gbogbo yoo gba to gun ju ti o ro.
I changed.	Mo yipada.
We never saw that.	A ko rii iyẹn rara.
I remember the last day.	Mo ranti ọjọ ikẹhin.
I was wrong.	Mo ti ṣe aṣiṣe.
Water must be used regularly.	A gbọdọ lo omi nigbagbogbo.
He asked for a job but did not get it.	O beere fun iṣẹ kan ṣugbọn ko gba.
I am not sure if that will die in me forever.	Emi ko ni idaniloju boya iyẹn yoo ku ninu mi lailai.
Or maybe he can’t.	Tabi boya ko le ni.
He poured tea into a cup.	O da tii sinu ife kan.
It hurts, it hurts.	O dun mi, o dun mi gaan.
You have so much to tell him.	O ni pupọ lati sọ fun u.
In anything, it brings something.	Ninu ohunkohun, o mu nkan wa.
I know this is not going to happen now but the ideas are there.	Mo mọ pe eyi kii yoo ṣẹlẹ ni bayi ṣugbọn awọn ero wa nibẹ.
Until then.	Titi rẹ.
I did nothing.	Emi ko ṣe nkankan.
These people would have been better without me.	Awọn eniyan wọnyi yoo ti dara julọ laisi mi.
You may want to consider that.	O le fẹ lati ro pe.
There may be several reasons for this.	Awọn idi pupọ le wa fun iyẹn.
This depends on your area.	Eyi da lori agbegbe rẹ gaan.
I'm thinking to call you.	Mo n ronu lati pe ọ.
The man is married with a family.	Ọkunrin naa ti ni iyawo pẹlu idile kan.
Marriage is the last thing on my mind.	Igbeyawo ni ohun ti o kẹhin lori ọkan mi.
At both points.	Ni aaye mejeeji.
You cannot be here without him.	O ko le wa nibi laisi rẹ.
We tried to find a place to sit.	A gbiyanju lati wa ibi kan lati joko.
You want to know how your system works.	O fẹ lati mọ bi eto rẹ ṣe n ṣiṣẹ.
You may have told him yesterday or this morning.	O le ti sọ fun u lana tabi owurọ yi.
I want to be the best.	Mo fẹ jẹ ti o dara julọ.
There was so much to see!	Nibẹ wà ki Elo lati ri!
We could have done a lot better.	A le ti ṣe pupọ dara julọ.
With their age.	Pẹlu ọjọ ori wọn.
No one moved.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o gbe.
He said he was a student.	O sọ pe ọmọ ile-iwe ni.
And one by one we entered the room.	Ati ọkan nipa ọkan a wọ yara.
I want them to know that.	Mo fẹ ki wọn mọ iyẹn.
We went to work.	A lọ ṣiṣẹ.
It has been lunch.	O ti jẹ ounjẹ ọsan.
If you speak.	Ti o ba sọrọ.
You can talk to anyone.	O le sọrọ si ẹnikẹni.
With energy we can add money.	Pẹlu agbara a le fi owo kun.
You are feeling it now.	O n rilara rẹ bayi.
I accept this error.	Mo gba aṣiṣe yii.
What we have ever seen is never seen.	Ohun ti a ti ri lailai ko ri.
Here is another question.	Eyi ni ibeere miiran.
I find it happens a little bit every day.	Mo rii pe o n ṣẹlẹ diẹ diẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ.
We were the last to leave.	A wà kẹhin lati lọ kuro.
They will all listen.	Gbogbo wọn yoo gbọ.
I love that great work.	Mo nifẹ ṣiṣẹ nla yẹn.
You will get the space.	Iwọ yoo gba aaye naa.
Play with these values ​​as you wish.	Mu ṣiṣẹ pẹlu awọn iye wọnyi bi o ṣe fẹ.
I can’t let myself think about it.	Emi ko le jẹ ki ara mi ro nipa o.
However you may know.	Sibẹsibẹ o le mọ.
Remove everything.	Mu ohun gbogbo kuro.
It also makes it warm.	O tun jẹ ki o gbona.
We missed all that.	A padanu gbogbo iyẹn.
Contact now !.	Kan si ni bayi!.
Things move sometimes.	Awọn ohun gbe ma.
Please let us know.	Jọwọ jẹ ki a sọ fun wa.
Try looking at things from above, or looking at them from below.	Gbiyanju lati wo awọn nkan lati oke, tabi wo wọn lati isalẹ.
There was no word from him.	Ko si ọrọ kan lati ọdọ rẹ.
Not because of me.	Kii ṣe nitori emi.
Go take your rest.	Lọ gba isinmi rẹ.
I can talk to him right now.	Mo le ba a sọrọ daradara ni bayi.
I did not tell you to read.	Emi ko sọ fun ọ pe ki o ka.
But if they don’t go in two minutes, you want to.	Ṣugbọn ti wọn ko ba lọ ni iṣẹju meji, o fẹ.
If it is bad we have to deal with it.	Ti o ba jẹ buburu a ni lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ.
Thus, he was anxious.	Bayi, o ni aniyan.
Nothing grows without rain.	Ko si nkan ti o dagba laisi ojo.
You decide which should be the front side of the table.	O pinnu eyi ti o yẹ ki o jẹ ẹgbẹ iwaju ti tabili naa.
I do not like what happens in the end with the eyes.	Emi ko fẹran ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ ni ipari pẹlu oju.
All your players are gone.	Gbogbo awọn ẹrọ orin rẹ ti lọ.
He did not think for sure.	Oun ko ronu dajudaju.
Come with your friends.	Wa pẹlu awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
Every man is important.	Gbogbo ọkunrin jẹ pataki.
So we will add them here.	Nitorina a yoo fi wọn kun nibi.
The journey was a long and arduous one.	Irin-ajo naa jẹ ọkan ti o gun ati lile.
I am coming to you.	Mo n de ọdọ rẹ.
And both of them have a lot of questions right now.	Ati pe awọn mejeeji ni ibeere pupọ ni bayi.
You play a lot of great games when your team needs them.	O ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn ere nla nigbati ẹgbẹ rẹ nilo wọn.
I went too late.	Mo ti lọ pẹ ju.
It makes us really happy.	O jẹ ki inu wa dun gaan.
And if the existing companies don’t like it, start yours.	Ati pe ti awọn ile-iṣẹ ti o wa tẹlẹ ko ba nifẹ rẹ, bẹrẹ tirẹ.
The future is not here yet, and the past is gone.	Ojo iwaju ko si nibi sibẹsibẹ, ati pe ohun ti o ti kọja ti lọ.
I look at the money again.	Mo wo owo naa lẹẹkansi.
She loves the stories she tells.	O fẹran awọn itan ti o sọ.
I can handle that.	Mo le mu iyẹn.
You want to know who everyone is going to call.	O fẹ lati mọ ẹni ti gbogbo eniyan yoo pe.
May make things easier for you to understand.	Le jẹ ki awọn nkan rọrun diẹ fun ọ lati ni oye.
This man is familiar with the past.	Ọkunrin yii mọ pẹlu awọn ti o ti kọja.
He does so now.	O ṣe bẹ ni bayi.
The children have a new teacher.	Awọn ọmọde ni olukọ tuntun.
If you can sleep for an hour or two.	Ti o ba jẹ pe o le sun fun wakati kan tabi meji.
I was okay with that.	Mo ti wà dara pẹlu ti o.
Could it not help to teach children?	Ṣe ko le ṣe iranlọwọ lati kọ awọn ọmọde?
The ball just goes out hot.	Bọọlu naa kan n jade ni gbona.
I understand that you are happy.	Mo ni oye yii pe inu rẹ dun.
He has a lot of friends.	O ni ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ.
We talked about.	A ti sọrọ lori.
I have little idea.	Mo ni kekere ero.
It has been like that since we were kids.	O ti ri bẹ lati igba ti a wa ni ọmọde.
I sat and pulled.	Mo ti joko ati ki o fa.
All the girls were happy.	Gbogbo awọn ọmọbirin ni o dun.
I need to run.	Mo nilo lati ṣiṣe.
Ask them why they want their space.	Beere lọwọ wọn idi ti wọn fi fẹ ki aaye wọn wa.
So think about what you want.	Nitorina ronu nipa ohun ti o fẹ.
They are not all dead.	Wọn kii ṣe gbogbo wọn ti ku.
Even in their sleep they are beautiful.	Paapaa ninu oorun wọn wọn lẹwa.
The more we are, the better.	Diẹ sii ti wa, dara julọ.
Why one always wants more.	Kini idi ti ọkan nigbagbogbo fẹ diẹ sii.
And if there is such a thing, let them not stand still.	Ati pe ti iru bẹ ba wa, jẹ ki wọn ko duro.
As it is yours.	Bi o ṣe ṣe jẹ tirẹ.
I know how happy it is when they like it.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe dun nigbati wọn fẹran rẹ.
However, there is an error.	Sibẹsibẹ, aṣiṣe kan wa.
We know what to expect from you.	A mọ ohun ti lati reti lati rẹ.
Few people get a job there.	Awọn eniyan diẹ ni o gba iṣẹ nibẹ.
Another man told the truth.	Ọkunrin miiran sọ otitọ.
We entered a room.	A wọ yara kan.
It’s on your own, they say.	O wa lori tirẹ, wọn sọ.
It was not his place.	O je ko rẹ ibi.
I'm done.	Mo ti ṣe.
I just took my eyes off the last minute.	Mo kan mu oju mi ​​kuro ni iṣẹju to kẹhin.
So, good.	Nitorina, o dara.
A table and some chairs.	A tabili ati diẹ ninu awọn ijoko.
Still don't, come to think of it.	Ṣi maṣe, wa lati ronu rẹ.
There is no such thing as a word or a book or a person.	Ko si iru nkan bii ọrọ tabi iwe tabi eniyan.
Agree with the program.	Gba pẹlu eto naa.
I have never been afraid in my life.	Emi ko bẹru rara ni igbesi aye mi.
The trees have been cut back.	A ti ge awọn igi pada.
We don’t even have the money to buy food.	A ko paapaa ni owo lati ra ounjẹ.
This cannot really happen.	Eyi ko le ṣẹlẹ gaan.
In that game a few things to note.	Ninu ere yẹn awọn nkan diẹ lati ṣe akiyesi.
Any kind of work.	Eyikeyi iru iṣẹ.
On their own they will be better.	Lori ara wọn wọn yoo dara.
With longer time.	Pẹlu akoko to gun.
It is about the law.	O jẹ nipa ofin.
Same as school.	Kanna bi ile-iwe.
They eat three times a day.	Wọn jẹun ni igba mẹta ni ọjọ kan.
But it seems, no.	Ṣugbọn o dabi, rara.
I have noticed this at work and at home.	Mo ti ṣe akiyesi eyi ni iṣẹ mejeeji ati ni ile.
But this only helps in a matter.	Ṣugbọn eyi ṣe iranlọwọ nikan inu ọrọ kan.
We need to be.	A nilo lati wa.
Sometimes for two hours.	Nigba miiran fun awọn wakati meji.
Of course you will.	Dajudaju iwọ yoo mu.
I would ask them to change.	Emi yoo beere pe ki wọn yipada.
He has never written anything.	Ko ti kọ nkankan.
Intuitive thoughts are not intrinsic thoughts.	Awọn ero inu oye kii ṣe awọn ero inu.
No matter how much they love them.	Ko si bi wọn ṣe fẹran wọn to.
Good place to be, it turns out.	Ibi ti o dara lati wa, o wa ni jade.
They found it impossible to climb that steep hill.	Wọn rii pe ko ṣee ṣe lati gun oke giga yẹn.
I don’t think you would think that.	Emi ko ro pe o yoo ro pe.
It’s not a fast one, something that will take weeks.	Kii ṣe ọkan ti o yara, nkan ti yoo gba awọn ọsẹ.
Add water only if needed.	Fi omi kun nikan ti o ba nilo.
Don't think about anything else.	Maṣe ronu nipa ohunkohun miiran.
This will explain it.	Eyi yoo ṣe alaye rẹ.
Such as a game.	Iru bi ere kan.
So much so.	Pupọ bẹ.
Carry out as before.	Gbe jade bi ti tẹlẹ.
Only man.	Eniyan nikan ni.
Power is gone.	Agbara ti lọ.
I will ask you again, when did you last see him?	Emi yoo tun beere lọwọ rẹ, nigbawo ni o rii i kẹhin?
I do not know why it is not but it is not.	Emi ko mọ idi ti kii ṣe ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ.
The vehicle is well maintained.	A ti tọju ọkọ naa daradara.
We take a moment to get ourselves together.	A gba akoko kan lati gba ara wa.
He wrote very good music.	O kọ orin ti o dara pupọ.
We hope this will change their living conditions.	A nireti pe eyi yoo yi ipo igbesi aye wọn pada.
Who knows what.	Tani o mọ kini.
Give the best.	Fun ni ti o dara julọ.
That could be better for now.	Iyẹn ṣee ṣe dara fun bayi.
The firm itself was as old as the buildings.	Awọn duro ara wà bi ti atijọ bi awọn ile.
You are buying a car this week.	O n ra ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan ni ọsẹ yii.
They can do whatever they want.	Wọn le ṣe ohunkohun ti wọn fẹ.
I'm very sad.	O dun mi gan.
It is not used to tell at all.	O ko lo lati sọ fun rara.
He did not go that way.	Ko lọ ni ọna yẹn.
They have no plans.	Wọn ko ni eto.
I am small.	Mo jẹ kekere.
Without this they lose.	Laisi eyi wọn padanu.
I do not tell anyone.	Nko so fun enikeni.
Things are not going well for you right now.	Awọn nkan ko dara fun ọ ni bayi.
She is very happy to receive.	Inu rẹ dun pupọ lati gba.
Wait at least a day or so.	Duro o kere ju ọjọ kan tabi bẹ.
I was the first to hear the news.	Emi ni ẹni akọkọ ti o gbọ iroyin naa.
But all of that was in the future.	Ṣugbọn gbogbo awọn ti o wà ni ojo iwaju.
We cannot read it if that is not the case.	A ko le ka rẹ ti iyẹn ko ba ri bẹ.
You have to help us.	O ni lati ran wa lọwọ.
If not, let it go.	Ti kii ba ṣe bẹ, jẹ ki o lọ.
I had to hurry to keep up with it.	Mo ni lati sare lati tọju pẹlu rẹ.
So there is a lot to do.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ wa lati ṣe.
You just don't want to get it.	O kan ko fẹ lati gba.
This school is open in a few days.	Ile-iwe yii ti ṣii ni awọn ọjọ diẹ.
He obviously didn’t take me seriously.	O han gbangba pe ko gba mi ni pataki.
I will get weeks like this every week, please.	Emi yoo gba awọn ọsẹ bii eyi ni gbogbo ọsẹ, jọwọ.
That's enough.	Ti pẹ to.
I don’t think you should interpret it.	Emi ko ro pe o yẹ ki o tumọ rẹ.
My gift to you is a child.	Ẹbun mi fun ọ ni ọmọ.
You don't want to see.	O ko fẹ lati ri.
They don't see it.	Won ko wo o.
So most of you.	Nitorina ni pupọ julọ ninu yin.
Just be yourself.	Kan jẹ ara rẹ.
I will not touch you.	Emi kii yoo fi ọwọ kan ọ.
Many of your programs do not work well.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn eto rẹ ko ṣiṣẹ daradara.
But do it right.	Ṣugbọn ṣe o tọ.
I just need to decide where to start.	Mo kan nilo lati pinnu ibiti mo ti bẹrẹ.
About how his mother beats him.	Nipa bi iya rẹ ṣe n lu u.
They do not speak.	Wọn ko sọrọ.
Was just.	Je o kan.
Maybe it would be better if they did.	Boya yoo dara ti wọn ba ṣe.
Nothing stands out.	Ko si ohun ti o duro jade.
Not many, either.	Ko ọpọlọpọ, boya.
Every time you continue with me.	Ni gbogbo igba ti o tẹsiwaju pẹlu mi.
Not by women today.	Kii ṣe nipasẹ awọn obinrin loni.
I doubt you can say the same thing.	Mo ṣiyemeji pe o le sọ ohun kanna.
Or something like that.	Tabi nkankan bi wipe.
You have thought a little more.	O ti ronu diẹ diẹ.
Remember, this situation does not explain it, or what happened.	Ranti, ipo yii ko ṣe alaye rẹ, tabi ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
He finished it.	O pari rẹ.
Something they will not do.	Nkankan ti wọn yoo ko ṣe.
He is a boy!	Ọmọkunrin ni!
That makes a good sense.	Iyẹn ṣe oye ti o dara julọ.
They will hurt but will pass.	Wọn yoo ṣe ipalara ṣugbọn yoo kọja.
But he could not do anything.	Ṣugbọn ko le ṣe ohunkohun.
Let it stand.	Jẹ ki o duro.
There is also space for more.	Aye tun wa fun diẹ sii.
I know how it is.	Mo mọ bi o ṣe jẹ.
That was tasty and well done.	Ti o wà dun ati ki o ṣe daradara.
It was a fun little family day !.	O je kan fun kekere ebi ọjọ!.
Or anything else for that matter.	Tabi ohunkohun miiran fun ti ọrọ.
The new moon will appear tonight.	Oṣu tuntun yoo han ni alẹ oni.
I talked to the people there that day.	Mo ti ba awọn eniyan ti o wa nibẹ sọrọ ni ọjọ yẹn.
Days are longer than winter in summer.	Awọn ọjọ gun ju igba otutu lọ ni igba ooru.
But don’t think everyone here is the same as you.	Ṣugbọn maṣe ro pe gbogbo eniyan nibi jẹ kanna bi iwọ.
I still remember.	Mo tun ranti.
I was wrong, and right.	Mo ṣe aṣiṣe, ati pe o tọ.
If we are late, we will have to make another appointment.	Ti a ba pẹ, a yoo ni lati ṣe ipinnu lati pade miiran.
And you must love it, fathers can not help.	Ati pe o gbọdọ nifẹ rẹ, awọn baba ko le ṣe iranlọwọ.
It allows me to grow and become stronger.	O jẹ ki n dagba ki o si ni okun sii.
You do not want to see anyone.	O ko fẹ lati ri ẹnikẹni.
The ship would have lost time.	Ọkọ naa yoo ti padanu akoko.
We did it just in time.	A ṣe o kan ni akoko.
People will notice.	Awọn eniyan yoo ṣe akiyesi.
We are unlikely to miss those who left.	O ṣeeṣe ki a ko padanu awọn ti o lọ kuro.
My own wife is convinced it works.	Iyawo ara mi ni idaniloju pe o ṣiṣẹ.
Everyone has to do their job.	Gbogbo eniyan ni lati ṣe iṣẹ wọn.
It is important that the water is not too hot.	O ṣe pataki ki omi ko gbona ju.
Too much everyone has gone too far.	Pupọ julọ gbogbo eniyan ti kọja pupọ.
This first came on my way to work.	Eyi akọkọ wa lori ọna mi lati ṣiṣẹ.
I started to really hate this job.	Mo bẹrẹ si korira iṣẹ yii gaan.
I moved to see him.	Mo ti gbe lati ri i.
I think it's very good.	Mo ro pe o dara pupọ.
What works for you, works for you.	Ohun ti o ṣiṣẹ fun ọ, ṣiṣẹ fun ọ.
He began to open the back door of the car.	O bẹrẹ si ṣi ilẹkun ẹhin ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa.
Be on the teachings in the text.	Jẹ lori awọn ẹkọ inu ọrọ naa.
Read the whole story.	Ka gbogbo itan naa.
I thought in her mind, what is important.	Mo ro ninu ọkan rẹ, ohun ti o jẹ pataki.
There is no place to return.	Ko si aaye lati pada.
After that, they can do what they want.	Lẹhin iyẹn, wọn le ṣe ohun ti wọn fẹ.
It has changed a little.	O ti yipada diẹ.
People will not have problems with it.	Eniyan kii yoo ni awọn iṣoro pẹlu rẹ.
People need more friends, everyone needs more friends.	Eniyan nilo awọn ọrẹ diẹ sii, gbogbo eniyan nilo awọn ọrẹ diẹ sii.
They knew they would find food here.	Wọn mọ pe wọn yoo wa ounjẹ nibi.
I cannot miss this world.	Emi ko le padanu aye yii.
No worries.	Ko si wahala.
And we don’t know what to do with that.	Ati pe a ko mọ kini lati ṣe pẹlu iyẹn.
You do not see it, until you get out of there.	Iwọ ko ri bẹ, titi iwọ o fi jade nibẹ.
That life is gone.	Igbesi aye yẹn ti lọ.
You don't miss it.	O ko padanu ti o.
But one out.	Ṣugbọn ọkan jade.
Raise your hand if you have a problem.	Gbe ọwọ rẹ soke ti o ba ni iṣoro kan.
There was no one to help him with the school work.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe iranlọwọ fun u pẹlu iṣẹ ile-iwe.
Maybe no time.	Boya ko si akoko kan.
Just my name.	O kan orukọ mi.
Please read them carefully.	Jọwọ ka wọn daradara.
A grown woman.	Obinrin ti o dagba.
That's bad news.	Iyẹn ni iroyin buburu.
A special rule.	Ofin pataki kan.
It deserves to be a surprise celebration.	O yẹ lati jẹ ayẹyẹ iyalẹnu.
I feel this.	Mo lero eyi.
He just wants to keep his promise.	O kan fe pa ileri.
At first, he paused for a moment.	Ni akọkọ, o da duro fun akoko.
Or some reason.	Tabi diẹ ninu awọn idi.
He will die in a year.	Oun yoo ku ni ọdun kan.
I will not do it again.	Emi kii yoo tun ṣe.
For good reason.	Fun idi ti o dara.
We have all seen pictures of it.	A ti gbogbo ri awọn aworan ti o.
Two people were coming towards him.	Eniyan meji n bọ si ọdọ rẹ.
I do not want.	Emi ko fẹ.
He would like to build a suitable house.	Oun yoo fẹ lati kọ ile ti o yẹ.
My father could not believe it.	Baba mi ko le gbagbọ.
Everything is possible.	Ohun gbogbo ti ṣee.
It seemed to be similar.	O dabi enipe o jẹ iru.
I need to keep it.	Mo nilo lati tọju rẹ.
I think he is back.	Mo ro pe o ti pada wa.
And that is a big problem.	Ati pe iyẹn jẹ iṣoro nla.
She is happy.	O ni inu oun dun.
You have heard his name.	O ti gbọ orukọ rẹ.
That’s the kind of place some people are.	Iyẹn ni iru ibi ti awọn eniyan kan wa.
I'll have to help.	Emi yoo ni lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
He can't even speak.	Ko le sọrọ paapaa.
Please get up.	Jọwọ dide.
They have to teach them.	Wọn ni lati kọ wọn.
This usually happens when you are late.	Eyi nigbagbogbo n ṣẹlẹ nigbati o ba pẹ.
Let's start with dad.	Jẹ ká bẹrẹ pẹlu baba.
Some do a little.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣe kekere kan.
We will see who has the final word here.	A yoo rii ẹniti o ni ọrọ ikẹhin nibi.
He remembers the day he met her.	O ranti ọjọ ti o pade rẹ.
They should be happy about the game they played.	Wọn yẹ ki o dun nipa ere ti wọn ṣe.
Many of them sound similar.	Pupọ ninu wọn dun iru.
Decisions need to be made.	Awọn ipinnu nilo lati ṣe.
What an amazing feeling it is.	Kini rilara iyalẹnu ti o jẹ.
We are a living person.	A jẹ eniyan ti o wa laaye.
Just try to get better.	O kan gbiyanju lati dara.
We ate delicious food.	A jẹ ounjẹ ti o dun.
He doesn't say much.	Ko sọ pupọ.
He closed his eyes and shook his head.	O di oju rẹ o si mi ori rẹ.
I think you have.	Mo ro pe o ni.
We just don't.	A o kan ko.
Another thing to remember is to make sure you drink enough water.	Ohun miiran lati ranti ni lati rii daju pe o mu omi to.
I need some help.	Mo nilo iranlọwọ diẹ.
You are not completely convinced.	O ko ni idaniloju patapata.
We dressed ourselves out.	A wọ ara wa jade.
I should know that they are friends.	Mo yẹ ki o mọ pe wọn jẹ ọrẹ.
One quick to tell the mother of the children.	Ọkan sare lati so fun iya awọn ọmọ.
There was nothing to fear from me.	Ko ni nkankan lati bẹru lati ọdọ mi.
Our injuries happen.	Awọn ipalara wa ṣẹlẹ.
It gave me the strength to move on.	O fun mi ni agbara lati tẹsiwaju.
Do not eat too much.	Maṣe jẹun pupọ.
But they told us enough.	Sugbon ti won so fun wa to.
So we are here.	Nitorina a wa nibi.
It depends on what the police are after.	O da lori ohun ti ọlọpa wa lẹhin.
He did not know what to do to help.	Ko mọ ohun ti yoo ṣe lati ṣe iranlọwọ.
What is love.	Kini ifẹ.
Try to play games.	Gbiyanju lati mu ere.
And you do not know what will become of your letters.	Ati pe o ko mọ ohun ti yoo di awọn lẹta rẹ.
He said only two children were born.	O sọ pe ọmọ meji nikan ni wọn bi.
Mo sare sare.	Mo sare sare.
We have not been able to do anything for the past two weeks.	A ko ni anfani lati ṣe ohunkohun fun ọsẹ meji sẹhin.
I arrived early for the flight.	Mo ti de ni kutukutu fun ọkọ ofurufu naa.
Get a plan.	Gba eto kan.
We get our thoughts from our mother.	A gba ero wa lati inu iya wa.
Stop whatever you are doing and listen.	Duro ohunkohun ti o n ṣe ki o gbọ.
I have been thinking about that fact for several weeks ago.	Mo ti n ronu nipa otitọ yẹn fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọsẹ sẹhin.
What a time of love it seemed.	Iru akoko ife ti o dabi enipe.
If you want to eat.	Ti o ba fẹ lati jẹ.
The weather is hot and humid.	Oju ojo ti n gbona ati ki o gbona.
There is a wedding early today.	Igbeyawo kan wa ni kutukutu loni.
We do not know for sure.	A ko mọ daju.
Tell us that story.	Sọ itan yẹn fun wa.
I do not expect everyone to think like me.	Emi ko nireti pe gbogbo eniyan yoo ronu bi emi.
I love how it can be enough.	Mo nifẹ bi o ṣe le to.
It will make the house.	O yoo ṣe ile.
It can cause problems.	O le fa awọn iṣoro.
But no one did.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe.
And that is the most important thing to me.	Ati pe iyẹn ni pataki julọ fun mi.
It will come out.	Yoo jade.
But they are not there.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko si nibẹ.
For me, there are no friends.	Fun mi, ko si awọn ọrẹ.
It's not a small if.	O ni ko kan kekere ti o ba ti.
We heard him return to his own bed.	A gbọ pe o pada si ibusun ara rẹ.
My children go to school by bus.	Awọn ọmọ mi lọ si ile-iwe nipa akero.
Maybe they should.	Boya wọn yẹ.
Just always through everything there.	O kan nigbagbogbo nipasẹ ohun gbogbo nibẹ.
Notice that you get it.	Ṣe akiyesi pe o gba.
But they are not the same.	Ṣugbọn wọn kii ṣe iru kanna.
The problem with all this is time.	Iṣoro pẹlu gbogbo eyi jẹ akoko.
Everything with it is something new.	Ohun gbogbo pẹlu rẹ jẹ nkan tuntun.
Now it is a very slow process.	Bayi o jẹ ọna ti o lọ silẹ pupọ.
And yet, it is not really easy.	Ati sibẹsibẹ, kii ṣe rọrun gaan.
I know where you are all the time.	Mo mọ ibiti o wa ni gbogbo igba.
You did not tell me that.	O ko so fun mi ti o.
The whole community knew they were there.	Gbogbo agbegbe mọ pe wọn wa nibẹ.
Look at what is under your feet, below you.	Wo ohun ti o wa labẹ ẹsẹ rẹ, ni isalẹ rẹ.
And even not afraid.	Ati paapaa ko bẹru.
It had to be but it was there.	O ni lati wa ṣugbọn o wa nibẹ.
Many people have been killed.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ti pa.
Maybe it's your hair.	Boya irun rẹ ni.
This does not mean higher education.	Eyi ko tumọ si pe ẹkọ ti o ga julọ.
Take it out for a month.	Mu ọ jade fun oṣu kan.
But he liked it there.	Ṣugbọn o fẹran rẹ nibẹ.
Not today, not next week, but down the road.	Kii ṣe loni, kii ṣe ọsẹ to nbọ, ṣugbọn isalẹ ọna.
Do all clothes have to be metal?	Ṣe gbogbo awọn aṣọ gbọdọ wa ni irin?
But he did not want to.	Ṣugbọn ko fẹ.
In this way.	Ni ọna yii.
We have to change the system.	A ni lati yi eto naa pada.
That is not the law.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ofin.
Same low cost.	Iye owo kekere kanna.
You need to find the truth.	O nilo lati rii otitọ.
They understand that, and they take that seriously.	Wọn loye iyẹn, wọn si gba iyẹn ni pataki.
Their little things.	Awọn nkan kekere wọn.
It was a nice place.	O je kan dara ibi.
I refuse, but he looks at me.	Mo kọ, ṣugbọn o n wo mi.
I hope you know how to keep up.	Mo nireti pe o mọ lati tọju.
And it was a great meal.	Ati pe o jẹ ounjẹ nla kan.
And now, of course, this approach is wrong.	Ati ni bayi, dajudaju, ọna yii jẹ aṣiṣe.
They are key.	Wọn jẹ bọtini.
I'm not sure why.	Emi ko ni idaniloju idi ti iyẹn.
It is a short term issue.	O jẹ ọrọ igba diẹ.
She thought of her children.	O ro ti awọn ọmọ rẹ.
We will have to continue to find another city.	A yoo ni lati tẹsiwaju ki a wa ilu miiran.
Two or three years, he said.	Ọdun meji tabi mẹta, o sọ.
Please come back and let me know how it works.	Jọwọ pada wa jẹ ki n mọ bi o ṣe n ṣe.
They can tell for themselves.	Wọn le sọ fun ara wọn.
He got up to our car and stopped.	O wa soke si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wa o si duro.
He promised he would.	O ṣe ileri pe oun yoo.
I too should have thought of it.	Emi naa yẹ ki o ti ronu rẹ.
It was a good look, he thought.	O je kan ti o dara wo, o ro.
He is in my place, he is in me.	O wa ni aaye mi, o wa mi.
He decided to find out what it was.	O pinnu lati wa ohun ti o jẹ.
Some run schools.	Diẹ ninu awọn ṣiṣe awọn ile-iwe.
I watched it happen.	Mo ti wo o ṣẹlẹ.
I forgot your name.	Mo ti gbagbe orukọ rẹ.
Okay, that seems like a good idea at least.	O dara, iyẹn dabi pe o jẹ imọran ni o kere ju.
She is doing well.	O n ṣe daradara.
He pulled back and decided.	O fa sẹhin o si pinnu.
I want him to die so he can not hurt my boys.	Mo fe ki o ku ki o ko le ṣe ipalara fun awọn ọmọkunrin mi.
Of all.	Ti gbogbo.
Like everything about this place.	Bi ohun gbogbo nipa ibi yi.
This situation may change.	Ipo yii le yipada.
No way, no how.	Ko si ọna, ko si bawo.
The historical period is very important around here.	Akoko itan jẹ pataki pupọ ni ayika ibi.
This story may be true.	Itan yii le jẹ otitọ.
And good words, too.	Ati ọrọ ti o dara, paapaa.
It's time to dump her.	O to akoko lati gba pada.
This is where it gets really interesting.	Eleyi jẹ ibi ti o ti n gan awon.
I cleaned the house.	Mo ti fo ile mọ.
Let the music, and something else, explain that.	Jẹ ki orin, ati nkan miiran, ṣe alaye naa.
The first is space.	Akọkọ jẹ aaye.
You see, he doesn't know what you're talking about, like.	Ṣe o rii, ko mọ ohun ti o n sọ, bii.
It is no less great.	O ti wa ni ko kere nla.
I love meeting new people.	Mo nifẹ ipade awọn eniyan tuntun.
She is anxious.	O ni aniyan.
All we really have is our homes, our cars and this space.	Gbogbo ohun ti a ni gaan ni awọn ile wa, awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ wa ati aaye yii.
I could never accept myself after that.	Emi ko le gba ara mi mọ rara lẹhin iyẹn.
My friend hurried into the house to pick up the phone.	Ọrẹ mi ti sare wọ inu ile lati gba foonu kan.
But with them you do not really know them.	Ṣugbọn pẹlu wọn o ko mọ wọn gaan.
With that, you will understand.	Pẹlu iyẹn, iwọ yoo ni oye.
At least you.	O kere ju iwọ lọ.
Or something like that.	Tabi nkankan bi wipe.
He is not the kind of person to kiss and say.	Oun kii ṣe iru eniyan lati fi ẹnu ko ati sọ.
That sister was not very important to me or my father.	Arabinrin yẹn ko ṣe pataki pupọ fun mi tabi baba mi.
This guy is going beyond that.	Arakunrin yii n lọ kọja iyẹn.
She fears she will be killed.	O bẹru pe wọn yoo pa ọmọ rẹ.
So you can tell everyone else.	Nitorina o le sọ fun gbogbo eniyan miiran.
This takes too long, and your hands also get stuck.	Eyi n gba gun ju, ati pe awọn ọwọ rẹ tun di.
We met the right person at the right time.	A pade eniyan ti o tọ ni akoko ti o tọ.
And that's not a bad thing.	Ati pe iyẹn kii ṣe ohun buburu.
When you look back, you are there.	Nigbati o ba wo ẹhin, o wa.
It has a lot to do.	O ni pupọ lati ṣe.
Something like a promise.	Nkankan bi ileri.
They can make music.	Wọn le ṣe orin.
He was a very good man.	O jẹ ọkunrin ti o dara gaan.
I have found my truth.	Mo ti ri otitọ mi.
The same, that is.	Awọn kanna, ni iyẹn.
I think, you will find the right decision.	Mo ro pe, iwọ yoo rii ipinnu to tọ.
Picture of his father.	Aworan baba re.
It just has to happen.	O kan ni lati ṣẹlẹ.
Take what you can, while you can get it.	Mu ohun ti o le, nigba ti o le gba.
This is the first.	Eyi jẹ akọkọ.
You can meet your best friends.	O le pade awọn ọrẹ rẹ ti o dara julọ.
This may have continued forever and ever.	Eyi le ti tẹsiwaju lailai ati lailai.
She is a woman.	Obinrin ni o.
Look me in the eye and say you are not feeling it at all.	Wo mi ni oju ki o sọ pe o ko rilara rẹ rara.
It is located on a high hill.	O wa lori oke giga kan.
I can feel your heat on my face.	Mo le lero ooru rẹ lori oju mi.
No problem with the first three rules.	Ko si iṣoro pẹlu awọn ofin mẹta akọkọ.
By doing this.	Nipa ṣiṣe eyi.
And they love it.	Ati pe wọn fẹran rẹ.
There are more women than men in the classroom.	Awọn obinrin ju awọn ọkunrin lọ ni yara kilasi.
I don’t mean to do.	Emi ko tumọ lati ṣe.
He was beautiful.	O si wà lẹwa.
See, you will not sell your first book.	Wo, iwọ kii yoo ta iwe akọkọ rẹ.
I have to travel.	Mo gbọdọ rin irin-ajo.
Just starting out.	Ti n bẹrẹ nikan.
I kept to myself.	Mo pa ara mi mọ́.
The body inside.	Ara inu naa.
But it was not over.	Sugbon o je ko pari.
It’s not that you think of them.	Kii ṣe pe o ro wọn.
You will need.	Iwọ yoo nilo.
He told me about his feet.	O sọ fun mi nipa ẹsẹ rẹ.
More on that here.	Diẹ sii lori iyẹn nibi.
But that is near the point.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn wa nitosi aaye naa.
This works great for us.	Eyi ṣiṣẹ nla fun wa.
Wrong boy.	Ọmọkunrin ti a ko tọ.
It needs to be small.	O nilo lati jẹ kekere.
Three of us are not enough to make a new city.	Mẹta ninu wa ko to lati ṣe ilu tuntun kan.
I have taken it.	Mo ti ya a.
It is still early however.	O tun wa ni kutukutu sibẹsibẹ.
But he was a special man.	Ṣugbọn o jẹ ọkunrin pataki kan.
I do not wear their clothes.	Emi ko wọ aṣọ wọn.
It lifted me up so much.	O gbe mi soke bẹ.
You can't try to do things.	O ko le gbiyanju lati ṣe awọn nkan.
Come into me.	Wa sinu mi.
I think we can do something really, really important here.	Mo ro pe a le se nkankan gan, gan pataki nibi.
He looked at the clock.	O wo aago.
Boys learn through play.	Awọn ọmọkunrin kọ ẹkọ nipasẹ ere.
I am a new person.	Emi ni eniyan tuntun.
But, that has not happened yet.	Ṣugbọn, iyẹn ko tii ṣẹlẹ sibẹsibẹ.
She woke up her sleeping children.	O ji awọn ọmọ rẹ ti o sun.
And he is.	Ati pe oun ni.
So the story goes.	Nitorina itan naa lọ.
They will not hear the thought.	Wọn kii yoo gbọ ero.
That seems unlikely to happen.	Iyẹn dabi pe ko ṣeeṣe pupọ lati ṣẹlẹ.
He will not go back.	Oun ko ni pada sẹhin.
Below we explain this.	Ni isalẹ a ṣe alaye eyi.
Those were also removed.	Awon ti won tun kuro.
I know you well.	Mo mọ ọ daradara.
He began to come back to her.	O bẹrẹ lati pada wa si ọdọ rẹ.
They are very intelligent.	Wọn jẹ oye pupọ.
I did what you said.	Mo ṣe ohun ti o sọ.
I was in that situation.	Mo ti wa ni ipo yẹn.
If you want to eat, you eat for him.	Ti o ba fẹ jẹun, o jẹun fun u.
No, he went back to the beach.	Rara, o pada si eti okun.
The sister did not call.	Arabinrin ko pe.
Many of them come from you.	Pupọ ninu wọn wa lati ọdọ rẹ.
Here are some pictures.	Eyi ni diẹ ninu awọn aworan.
They have to go to school.	Wọn ni lati lọ si ile-iwe.
Even less so.	Paapaa o kere ju iyẹn lọ.
Maybe you are looking for your lost husband.	Boya o n wa ọkọ rẹ ti o padanu.
I know what you are feeling now.	Mo mọ ohun ti o rilara bayi.
He expects trouble.	O nireti wahala.
It is not an easy thing to live up to.	Kii ṣe ohun ti o rọrun lati gbe soke si.
I feel that you have grown now.	Mo lero pe o ti dagba ni bayi.
Of course not to the man.	Dajudaju kii ṣe si ọkunrin naa.
It will not work.	Kii yoo ṣiṣẹ.
But, it still makes sense.	Ṣugbọn, o tun n ṣe ohun ori.
This is what we do in many places.	Eyi ni ohun ti a ṣe ni awọn aaye pupọ.
All three groups kept their money.	Gbogbo awọn ẹgbẹ mẹta pa owo wọn mọ.
But this did not happen.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko ṣe.
You will learn about running.	Iwọ yoo kọ ẹkọ nipa ṣiṣe.
You agree to accept the offer, but only on your own terms.	O gba lati gba iṣẹ naa, ṣugbọn lori awọn ofin tirẹ.
I am in a state of mind.	Mo ti wa ni ipo ero kan.
Nice to see you again.	O dun lati ri ọ lẹẹkansi.
I know there is more for me to learn.	Mo mọ pe diẹ sii wa fun mi lati kọ ẹkọ.
Just a matter of who will lose	O kan ọrọ kan ti tani yoo padanu
No one will want to read it.	Ko si ọkan yoo fẹ lati ka o.
It was a good time to think.	O jẹ akoko ti o dara lati ronu.
Conditions are also important.	Awọn ipo tun ṣe pataki.
Please let him go.	Jọwọ jẹ ki o lọ.
You have to do it in a little more time.	O ni lati ṣe ni akoko kan diẹ sii.
Also explain what the key issue with the problem is.	Tun ṣe alaye kini ọrọ pataki pẹlu iṣoro naa jẹ.
We also know each other, we also learn.	A tun n mọ ara wa, a tun kọ ẹkọ.
We will go out for a drink.	A yoo jade lọ fun ohun mimu.
There is nothing more to this than that.	Ko si ohun miiran si eyi gaan.
The bed was made.	A ṣe ibusun naa.
Let me assure you.	Jẹ ki n da ọ loju.
Everything about us stands great.	Ohun gbogbo nipa wa duro je nla.
They cook all day!	Wọn ṣe ounjẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ!
And he is here with us.	Ati pe o wa nibi pẹlu wa.
No need no.	Ko nilo ko si.
And there is another place.	Ati pe ibi miiran wa.
They have not received a book in weeks.	Wọn ko ti gba iwe ni awọn ọsẹ.
Now, lift the legs up again.	Bayi, gbe awọn ẹsẹ soke lẹẹkansi.
I can really feel it.	Mo ti le gan lero o.

But keep to yourself.	Ṣugbọn pa ara rẹ mọ.
You do not want to hear opinions.	O ko fẹ gbọ awọn ero.
Stop them if you can.	Da wọn duro ti o ba le.
They do not need to think about it.	Wọn ko nilo lati ronu nipa rẹ.
Now is my time to look.	Bayi o jẹ akoko mi lati wo.
Our eyes meet.	Oju wa pade.
If something happens, let me know.	Ti nkan kan ba ṣẹlẹ, jẹ ki mi mọ.
Nothing else to wear.	Ko si ohun miiran ti o wọ.
The boy is tall for his age.	Ọmọkunrin naa ga fun ọjọ ori rẹ.
You must have some of your own.	O gbọdọ ni diẹ ninu awọn ti ara rẹ.
They arrive early for a game.	Wọn de ni kutukutu fun ere kan.
Would love to know what it is.	Yoo nifẹ lati mọ kini o jẹ.
They know where we are now.	Wọn mọ ibi ti a wa bayi.
This is not my room.	Eyi kii ṣe yara yara mi.
I love things.	Mo nifẹ awọn nkan.
They rushed from the room.	Wọn sare lati yara naa.
We run at night.	A ṣiṣe ni alẹ.
Do not miss this opportunity, he told her.	Maṣe padanu anfani yii, o sọ fun u.
Every day is a new day.	Gbogbo ọjọ jẹ ọjọ tuntun.
It seemed to work well.	O dabi enipe o ṣiṣẹ daradara.
Dress code	Aṣọ ti a wọ
That's not the word you want to hear.	Iyẹn kii ṣe awọn ọrọ ti o fẹ gbọ.
He lives near her.	O ngbe nitosi rẹ.
That is the purpose of the game.	Idi ti ere niyen.
She continues to help herself to her diet, her eyes never leaving her.	O tẹsiwaju lati ṣe iranlọwọ fun ararẹ si ounjẹ rẹ, oju ko fi tirẹ silẹ.
We hope to come back with more of our family.	A nireti lati pada wa pẹlu diẹ sii ti idile wa.
From the first minute, we knew it was important.	Lati iṣẹju akọkọ, a mọ pe o jẹ pataki.
I work in a drinking water company.	Mo ṣiṣẹ ni ile-iṣẹ omi mimu.
Below are a few you can try.	Ni isalẹ wa ni diẹ ti o le gbiyanju.
You almost want to sleep.	O fẹrẹ fẹ lati sun.
I would like to make friends.	Emi yoo fẹ lati ṣe awọn ọrẹ.
A jade.	A jade.
I know they have two children.	Mo mọ pe wọn ni awọn ọmọde meji.
I think it will take longer.	Mo ro pe yoo gba to gun.
But marriage did not work.	Ṣugbọn igbeyawo ko ṣiṣẹ.
But they do not see everyone.	Ṣugbọn wọn ko ri gbogbo eniyan.
It made me grow up thinking he was dead.	O jẹ ki n dagba ni ero pe o ti ku.
The name of the company is mentioned.	A sọ orukọ ile-iṣẹ naa.
Just something happened.	O kan nkankan ti o ṣẹlẹ.
It seems like most of it is a book.	O dabi pe pupọ julọ rẹ jẹ iwe.
Leave things as they are.	Fi awọn nkan silẹ bi wọn ṣe jẹ.
This was not the same.	Eleyi je ko kanna.
Exit! 	Jade!
We will not talk about such things.	A kii yoo sọrọ nipa iru awọn nkan bẹẹ.
I won't talk to you even tomorrow.	Emi kii yoo ba ọ sọrọ paapaa ni ọla.
I have nothing in my name.	Emi ko ni nkankan ni orukọ mi.
Try to go it all out if time is of the essence.	Gbiyanju lati lọ gbogbo rẹ ti akoko ba ṣe pataki.
It was so amazing to be able to laugh again.	O jẹ iyanu pupọ lati ni anfani lati rẹrin lẹẹkansi.
That is, this is your big world.	Eyi ni, eyi ni aye nla rẹ.
Don't lose your money.	Maṣe padanu owo rẹ.
For the first few days it was nothing.	Fun awọn ọjọ diẹ akọkọ o ko jẹ ohun kan.
You have that power, and we don't want that to happen.	O ni agbara yẹn, ati pe a ko fẹ ki iyẹn ṣẹlẹ.
My sister gave me some nice clothes.	Arabinrin mi fun mi ni awọn aṣọ lẹwa.
That is why we are strong.	Iyẹn fun idi wa ni agbara.
He spoke to the dead.	O sọrọ si awọn ti o ku.
Very good.	O dara gaan.
He was alone with the driver.	Oun nikan wa pẹlu awakọ naa.
You do it alone.	O ṣe nikan.
Very good value.	Iye ti o dara pupọ.
Your box is there.	Apoti rẹ wa nibẹ.
Maybe again.	Boya lẹẹkansi.
But notice this.	Ṣugbọn ṣe akiyesi eyi.
We are not who we are.	A kii ṣe ẹni ti a jẹ.
There will be one last time, the last world.	Igba ikẹhin yoo wa, aye ti o kẹhin.
Maybe my eyes let you do it.	Boya oju mi ​​ni o jẹ ki o ṣe.
Not now, not forever, he said.	Kii ṣe bayi, kii ṣe lailai, o sọ.
It cannot happen.	Ko le ṣẹlẹ.
It has been a long time since we met.	O ti pẹ diẹ ti a ti pade.
I was afraid of him and for me.	Mo bẹru fun u ati fun mi.
He has been dead ever since.	O ti ku lati igba naa.
I have changed my mind a lot about names for a child.	Mo ti yi ọkan mi pada pupọ nipa awọn orukọ fun ọmọ.
Ask for special equipment to do the job.	Beere ohun elo pataki lati ṣe iṣẹ naa.
But that is over.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ti pari.
When you are young, they are not called gifts.	Nigbati o ba wa ni ọdọ, wọn ko pe ni ẹbun.
I will try again next year.	Emi yoo tun gbiyanju lẹẹkansi ni ọdun to nbọ.
They can't see.	Wọn ko le rii.
How fast they arrived.	Bawo ni wọn ti yara de.
We eat everyone from high to low.	A jẹ gbogbo eniyan lati giga si kekere.
I just want to add more words.	Mo kan fẹ lati fi awọn ọrọ diẹ sii.
Many old houses have been rebuilt.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile atijọ ti tun ṣe.
This is very easy to do.	Eyi rọrun pupọ lati ṣe.
I love us together.	Mo nifẹ wa papọ.
The two students seem to be working well together.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe meji dabi pe wọn ṣiṣẹ daradara papọ.
Anyone who refuses will be outside.	Ẹnikẹni ti o ba kọ yoo wa ni ita.
Let us know if you need anything.	Jẹ ki a mọ ti o ba nilo ohunkohun.
This is a really nice place.	Eleyi jẹ kan gan dara ibi.
Everybody.	Gbogbo eniyan.
I hope you have a new year.	Mo nireti pe o ni ọdun tuntun.
But that is not how history unfolds.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn kii ṣe bi itan ṣe ṣẹlẹ.
He could not do anything wrong.	Ko le ṣe ohunkohun buburu.
I doubt, how many people will be.	Mo ṣiyemeji, bii ọpọlọpọ eniyan yoo jẹ.
But one important thing changed.	Ṣugbọn ohun pataki kan yipada.
Today he left work early.	Loni o fi iṣẹ silẹ ni kutukutu.
She did not know if her husband would return.	O ko mọ boya ọkọ rẹ yoo pada.
I can not understand why no one did.	Emi ko le loye idi ti ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe.
He asked for help to walk.	O beere iranlọwọ lati rin.
I will return to your house that night to sleep.	Emi yoo pada si ile rẹ ni alẹ yẹn lati sun.
That’s what you do when you’re high.	Iyẹn ni ohun ti o ṣe nigbati o ba ga.
Surprisingly, she was free to talk about it.	Iyalẹnu, o gbe laaye lati sọ nipa rẹ.
This is true in two ways.	Eyi jẹ otitọ ni awọn ọna meji.
You have all the time to teach your child these.	O ni gbogbo akoko lati kọ ọmọ rẹ awọn wọnyi.
I will not be in town.	Emi kii yoo wa ni ilu.
And stand up and.	Ati ki o duro si oke ati awọn.
And it takes days.	O si gba awọn ọjọ.
Marriage can.	Igbeyawo le.
He stopped to use the rest room.	O duro lati lo yara isinmi.
Good education is here for everyone.	Ẹkọ to dara wa nibi fun gbogbo eniyan.
Three times in the head.	Ni igba mẹta ni ori.
Do not let it reach you.	Maṣe jẹ ki o de ọdọ rẹ.
The baby is OK.	Ọmọ naa dara.
We could not have done so.	A ko ti le ṣe bẹ.
Here nothing.	Nibi ko si nkankan.
I look at it.	Mo wo re.
The question is too personal.	Ibeere naa jẹ ti ara ẹni ju.
But you know, people always say you look like someone.	Ṣugbọn o mọ, awọn eniyan nigbagbogbo sọ pe o dabi ẹnikan.
He kept his head down.	O pa ori rẹ mọ.
A device can perform this function.	Ẹrọ kan le ṣe iṣẹ yii.
But at least they did not try to kill themselves.	Sugbon o kere wọn ko gbiyanju lati pa ara wọn.
I'm thinking about it too.	Mo n ronu nipa rẹ paapaa.
Or they should.	Tabi wọn yẹ.
To talk about what we love.	Lati sọrọ nipa ohun ti a nifẹ.
He’s the guy on the picture up there, by the way.	Oun ni eniyan ti o wa lori aworan soke nibẹ, nipasẹ ọna.
The sister understood it well.	Arabinrin naa loye rẹ daradara.
Before that, she only knew her mother.	Ṣaaju eyi, o mọ iya nikan.
There is nothing you can do to stop it.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣe lati da a duro.
We met at a wedding.	A pade ni a igbeyawo.
For many this is a new concept.	Fun ọpọlọpọ eyi jẹ imọran tuntun.
But obviously he wants to work with us.	Ṣugbọn o han pe o fẹ lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu wa.
You’re asking the wrong people.	O n beere lọwọ awọn eniyan ti ko tọ.
I think here it will.	Mo ro nibi pe yoo.
I need it by my side every day of my life.	Mo nilo rẹ ni ẹgbẹ mi ni gbogbo ọjọ ti igbesi aye mi.
That works much, much better.	Ti o ṣiṣẹ Elo, Elo dara.
See what he did last time.	Wo ohun ti o ṣe ni igba ikẹhin.
I do not know where they stand.	Emi ko mọ ibiti wọn duro.
Maybe you can.	Boya o le.
And maybe it’s just life.	Ati boya o jẹ aye nikan.
You know, it's amazing.	O mọ, o jẹ iyalẹnu.
Continue with the sister.	Tẹsiwaju pẹlu arabinrin naa.
It helps a lot.	O ni iranlọwọ nla.
He talked to me for an hour.	O ba mi sọrọ fun wakati kan.
However, it also started up.	Sibẹsibẹ, o tun bẹrẹ soke.
I'm waiting for you.	Mo n duro de e.
I don’t mean well.	Emi ko tumọ si daradara.
The celebration is not good.	Ayẹyẹ naa ko dara.
One thing at a time.	Ohun kan ni akoko kan.
I gave them the information.	Mo fun wọn ni alaye naa.
We love it here better.	A nifẹ rẹ nibi dara.
A watch was in the box.	A aago wà ninu apoti.
There are two things to note here.	Awọn nkan meji wa lati ṣe akiyesi nibi.
Just don't know.	O kan ko mọ.
The male side is the side with the back.	Ẹgbẹ ọkunrin naa jẹ ẹgbẹ pẹlu ẹhin.
For ideas to stand on their own.	Fun awọn ero lati duro lori ara wọn.
He prefers homes with fireplaces.	O fẹ awọn ile pẹlu awọn ibi ina.
We just love to eat !.	A kan nifẹ lati jẹun!.
I am not afraid of him.	Emi ko bẹru rẹ.
He’d stay another week, he decided.	O fẹ duro ọsẹ miiran, o pinnu.
I never looked at your face.	Emi ko wo oju rẹ rara.
They are often better working places in other ways as well.	Wọn ti wa ni igba dara ṣiṣẹ ibi ni awọn ọna miiran bi daradara.
You will need a lot of energy.	Iwọ yoo nilo agbara pupọ.
E se pupo.	E se pupo.
He seems to be remembering.	O dabi ẹni pe o n ranti.
For that reason just fine.	Fun idi yẹn o kan dara.
We are into that.	A wa sinu iyẹn.
Which brings me into the story of this game.	Eyi ti o mu mi wa sinu itan ti ere yii.
You can believe whatever you want.	O le gbagbọ ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
You do not need it.	O ko nilo rẹ.
For that summer I was taken away.	Fun igba ooru yẹn wọn gbe mi lọ.
You have a bad game.	O ni ere buburu kan.
And if my dad got his way, he wouldn’t do it again.	Ati pe ti baba mi ba ni ọna rẹ, ko tun ṣe.
A few minutes ago he wanted to move and he didn’t.	Ni iṣẹju diẹ sẹhin o fẹ lati gbe ati pe ko ṣe.
I want for some reason.	Mo fẹ fun idi kan.
There was a big accident yesterday	Ijamba nla kan wa ni ana
Not interested.	Ko nifẹ.
One of them called you this morning.	Ọkan ninu wọn pe e ni owurọ yi.
I get that kind of personal.	Mo gba iru ti ara ẹni.
He looked at his watch, got up to leave.	O wo aago rẹ, o dide lati lọ.
He wants them back.	O fe wọn pada.
This is a great opportunity for us.	Eyi jẹ anfani nla fun wa.
There are not many trees in this area.	Ko si ọpọlọpọ awọn igi ni agbegbe yii.
Here he speaks, he dies.	Nibi o sọrọ, o ku.
And we will take care of these little ones.	Ati pe a yoo tọju awọn ọmọde kekere wọnyi.
I will not worry about them.	Emi kii yoo ṣe aniyan nipa wọn.
You can have any name you want.	O le ni eyikeyi orukọ ti o fẹ.
Maybe it’s some of both.	Boya o jẹ diẹ ninu awọn mejeeji.
We must wait.	A gbọdọ duro.
It is important.	O jẹ pataki.
You will receive a box from us.	Iwọ yoo gba apoti kan lati ọdọ wa.
Or, possibly, not the issue itself.	Tabi, o ṣee ṣe, kii ṣe ọrọ funrararẹ.
It is all that will be needed.	O jẹ gbogbo ohun ti yoo nilo.
Do not open the door for anyone.	Maṣe ṣi ilẹkun fun ẹnikẹni.
Words run out.	Awọn ọrọ ṣiṣe jade.
He told me.	O sọ fun mi.
At one point, he had to leave.	Ni aaye kan, o gbọdọ fi silẹ.
It just came my way.	O kan wa ni ọna mi.
You think time is running out.	O ro pe akoko ti n lọ.
You have to come back to the station with me.	O ni lati pada wa si ibudo pẹlu mi.
I do not know what can happen.	Emi ko mọ ohun ti o le ṣẹlẹ.
He tried again and the same thing happened.	O tun gbiyanju lẹẹkansi ati pe ohun kanna ṣẹlẹ.
You look away, but think better.	O wo kuro, ṣugbọn ro o dara julọ.
They don’t want me to walk alone.	Wọn ko fẹ ki n rin nikan.
But you have to give him another life.	Ṣugbọn o ni lati fun u ni aye miiran.
No, it will not be like this forever.	Rara, kii yoo jẹ bi eleyi lailai.
They live on the road.	Wọn n gbe ni opopona.
He could not do more.	Ko le ṣe diẹ sii.
That's great.	Iyẹn dara julọ.
This does not mean that the word is misunderstood.	Eyi ko tumọ si pe a ko loye ọrọ naa.
They make a lot and a lot of money.	Wọn ṣe ọpọlọpọ ati ọpọlọpọ owo.
However, it depends on the facts.	Sibẹsibẹ, o da lori otitọ.
I can't sleep.	Mi o ti le sun.
Know which door to use.	Mọ ilẹkun wo lati lo.
Many big houses have been built over a long period of time.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ile nla ni a ti kọ ni igba pipẹ.
This is a job.	Eyi jẹ iṣẹ kan.
I promise never to do that again.	Mo ṣe ileri lati ma ṣe iyẹn lẹẹkansi.
You may well ask yourself how it is possible.	O le daradara beere ara rẹ bawo ni o ṣe ṣee ṣe.
We had to get off the boat.	A ni lati lọ kuro ni ọkọ oju omi.
But often you do not have time to do this.	Ṣugbọn nigbagbogbo o ko ni akoko lati ṣe eyi.
So there is my car.	Nitorina o wa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi.
However you want to.	Sibẹsibẹ o fẹ.
They look good and he and I are.	Wọn dara dara ati pe oun ati emi ni.
So many homes.	Nitorina ọpọlọpọ awọn ile.
Drink a drink.	Mu ohun mimu.
I lost track of time.	Mo ti padanu orin ti akoko.
But in the end the program worked.	Ṣugbọn ni ipari eto naa ṣiṣẹ.
You do not charge per hour.	O ko gba agbara ni wakati.
I need water.	Mo nilo omi.
They say he died a few years ago.	Wọn sọ pe o ti ku ni ọdun diẹ sẹhin.
People in the area will tell you the same story.	Awọn eniyan ni agbegbe yoo sọ itan kanna fun ọ.
I'm very angry now.	Mo binu gidigidi bayi.
I have a lot.	Mo ni pupọ.
Great value of anything.	Nla iye ti ohunkohun.
Sometimes people have to think outside the box.	Nigba miiran eniyan ni lati ronu ni ita apoti.
I was feeling it.	Mo ti rilara rẹ.
The game went well.	Ere orin naa lọ daradara.
It was my everything.	O je mi ohun gbogbo.
I have no idea what is wrong with it.	Emi ko ni imọran kini aṣiṣe pẹlu rẹ.
That it could be anyone you want to be.	Pe o le jẹ ẹnikẹni ti o fẹ lati jẹ.
It was written into him to do.	A kọ ọ sinu rẹ lati ṣe.
Sometimes this is so.	Nigba miiran eyi jẹ bẹ.
I would not believe that.	Emi ko ni gbagbọ pe.
You look your way.	O wo ọna rẹ.
Accepted the question.	Ti gba ibeere naa.
None of us want to stop.	Ko si ọkan ninu wa ti o fẹ lati da duro mọ.
Do not do this thing.	Maṣe ṣe nkan yii.
I feel your love for me.	Mo lero ifẹ rẹ si mi.
He did not leave a letter, he thought to himself.	O ko fi lẹta silẹ, o ronu ninu ara rẹ.
Not good or bad.	Ko dara tabi buburu.
For the very same reason.	Fun idi kanna pupọ.
Maybe not.	Boya ko ṣe bẹ.
I know it is for me.	Mo mọ pe o wa fun mi.
I will not tell you what they call.	Emi kii yoo sọ fun ọ ohun ti wọn pe.
It is up to them to keep quiet and listen.	O jẹ fun wọn lati pa ẹnu mọ ki wọn si gbọ.
That cannot be said here.	Iyẹn ko le sọ nibi.
Can't do it fast enough.	Ko le ṣe ni yara to.
We did not eat breakfast.	A ko jẹ ounjẹ owurọ.
At least that’s how it started.	O kere ju iyẹn ni bii o ti bẹrẹ.
Good thing !.	Nkan to dara!.
They will find you.	Wọn yoo wa ọ.
Now, we must find a way.	Bayi, a gbọdọ wa ọna kan.
What it is and what it does.	Ohun ti o jẹ ati ohun ti o ṣe.
Let’s take the kids.	Jẹ ki a mu awọn ọmọde.
I do not understand how this can be.	Emi ko loye bi eyi ṣe le jẹ.
Your job is to do it and you have to finish it.	Iṣẹ rẹ ni lati ṣe ati pe o ni lati pari.
I should be very worried about it.	O yẹ ki n ṣe aniyan pupọ nipa rẹ.
Time to change course.	Akoko lati yi dajudaju.
If you decide to move, find a small house.	Ti o ba pinnu lati gbe, wa ile kekere kan.
They can see such a thing.	Wọn le rii iru nkan bẹẹ.
One of us will.	Ọkan ninu wa yoo.
There is no way to corrupt your thinking about yourself.	Ko si ọna lati ba ero rẹ nipa ara rẹ jẹ.
They can pretty much do what they want.	Wọn le lẹwa Elo ṣe ohun ti wọn fẹ.
You want to quit your job.	O fẹ lati fi iṣẹ rẹ silẹ.
But that idea is out of place.	Ṣugbọn ero yẹn ko si ni aaye.
Or they can.	Tabi wọn le.
I tried with music now but it was not good.	Mo gbiyanju pẹlu orin ni bayi ṣugbọn ko dara.
There is a car.	Ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan wa.
Always hated it.	Nigbagbogbo ti korira rẹ.
If you do not talk about it at all, it does not exist.	Ti o ko ba sọrọ nipa rẹ rara, ko si tẹlẹ.
It didn't look good, but it worked.	Ko ṣe dara julọ, ṣugbọn o ṣiṣẹ.
I just could not bring myself to do it.	O kan ko le mu ara mi lati ṣe.
It is completely written here.	O ti kọ silẹ patapata nibi.
If that works.	Ti iyẹn ba ṣiṣẹ.
On top of that, we are still waiting.	Lori iyẹn, a tun n duro de.
Three times he died.	Igba mẹta ti ku.
Much of their work is done by hand.	Pupọ julọ iṣẹ wọn ni a ṣe nipasẹ ọwọ.
We told them we were everywhere.	A sọ fun wọn pe a wa nibi gbogbo.
It will be seen as another major.	O yoo wa ni ti ri bi miiran pataki.
She is happy to have something to do.	Inu re dun lati ni nkan lati se.
Such a thing is for other people.	Iru nkan bẹẹ jẹ fun awọn eniyan miiran.
It could be.	O le jẹ.
Two observations are used.	Awọn akiyesi meji lo.
We’ve made money, but not friends.	A ti ṣe owo, ṣugbọn kii ṣe awọn ọrẹ.
We want more, now we get it.	A fẹ diẹ sii, ni bayi a gba.
I am happy for your work.	Inu mi dun si ise re.
Importantly, the key to the future.	O ṣe pataki, bọtini si ojo iwaju.
Outside there is no place to raise children.	Ni ita ko si aaye lati gbe awọn ọmọde dagba.
It was the deadline.	O je akoko ipari.
You want to be human.	O fẹ lati jẹ eniyan.
Get that girl.	Gba ọmọbirin yẹn.
But do not be afraid.	Ṣugbọn maṣe bẹru.
The facts do not matter.	Awọn otitọ ko ṣe pataki.
I know this for real.	Mo mọ eyi fun otitọ.
Send everything else.	Fi ohun gbogbo miiran ranṣẹ.
It wasn’t long for me, that was.	Ko pẹ fun mi, iyẹn ni.
I reached both.	Mo de awon mejeeji.
The truth is that you are waiting.	Otitọ ni pe o ti n duro de.
I made it and took it to work and everyone loved it.	Mo ṣe o si mu lọ si iṣẹ ati pe gbogbo eniyan nifẹ rẹ.
Everything has the right time and place.	Ohun gbogbo ni akoko ati aaye ti o yẹ.
My dad would pick me up after work.	Baba mi yoo gbe mi lẹhin iṣẹ.
We have happened a short time.	A ti ṣẹlẹ ni igba diẹ.
I miss you so much.	Mo ti padanu re pupo.
Or he does not see me.	Tabi ko wo mi.
I lost my children, my life.	Mo padanu awọn ọmọ mi, igbesi aye mi.
It requires great strength.	O nilo agbara nla.
Just the way it is.	O kan bi o ṣe jẹ.
Prices are per room.	Iye owo wa fun yara kan.
Very nice to come.	O dara pupọ lati wa.
Please stay here for me.	Jọwọ duro nibi fun mi.

After yesterday.	Lẹhin lana.
I have never seen anything more beautiful.	Emi ko tii ri ohunkohun ti o lẹwa diẹ sii.
We lost a lot of time and energy there.	A padanu akoko pupọ ati agbara nibẹ.
A minute passed.	Iṣẹju kan kọja.
She quickly looked back.	O yara wo lẹhin.
They do not believe me.	Wọn ko gbagbọ mi.
It's in the eye.	O wa ni oju.
You say you do not want that for yourself.	O sọ pe iwọ ko fẹ iyẹn fun ara rẹ.
Often, but what does this have to do.	Nigbagbogbo, ṣugbọn kini eyi ni lati ṣe.
The students are taking the final exam.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe n ṣe idanwo ikẹhin.
I had to be able to see it in person.	Mo ni lati ni anfani lati wo rẹ ni oju.
You will want to stay on the good side.	Iwọ yoo fẹ lati duro si ẹgbẹ ti o dara.
It works.	O n ṣiṣẹ.
It's a great book.	Iwe nla ni.
This woman needs to keep quiet.	Obinrin yii nilo lati pa ẹnu mọ.
It is in your heart.	O wa ninu ọkan rẹ.
This makes sense of course.	Eleyi mu ki ori ti dajudaju.

The girl was overjoyed with the surprise of her birthday.	Inu ọmọbirin naa dun pẹlu iyalẹnu ọjọ ibi rẹ.
It happens again and again.	O ṣẹlẹ lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.

He stood up to his mother.	O dide duro si iya rẹ.
Or our word.	Tabi ọrọ wa.
On the way home, we stopped for dinner.	Ni ọna ile, a duro fun ounjẹ alẹ.

Everything you love is gone.	Gbogbo ohun ti o nifẹ ti lọ.

Or at least was.	Tabi ni tabi ni o kere wà.
What you wear is very important.	Ohun ti o wọ jẹ pataki pupọ.

He tells us about it.	O sọ fun wa nipa rẹ.

And it is important.	Ati pe o ṣe pataki.

Much is happening in it.	Pupọ n ṣẹlẹ ninu rẹ.
Men have to break in one place.	Awọn ọkunrin ni lati fọ ni aaye kan.
I do not want it here.	Nko fe e nibi.
It is possible, even if it is not very possible.	O ṣee ṣe, paapaa ti ko ba ṣeeṣe pupọ.
No other seats.	Ko si awọn ijoko miiran.
It must have fallen.	O gbọdọ ti lọ silẹ.

He enjoys his company and seems to enjoy his own.	O gbadun ile-iṣẹ rẹ ati pe o dabi ẹni pe o gbadun tirẹ.

No problem finding something you like.	Ko ni wahala ri nkan ti o fẹ.
You have not seen such a beautiful face in years.	O ti ko ri iru kan lẹwa oju ni odun.

He began to quit his job.	O bẹrẹ si kọ iṣẹ rẹ silẹ.
Food is waiting for you.	Ounjẹ n duro de ọ.
That is not my job.	Iyẹn kii ṣe iṣẹ mi.
His hand also rose, the hand of iron, and pulled.	Ọwọ rẹ si dide paapaa, ọwọ irin, o si fa.
That happens a lot of times.	Ti o ṣẹlẹ ọpọlọpọ igba.
Citizens accept it.	Awon ara ilu gba e.

We are friends.	A jẹ ọrẹ.
The trip took more than two days.	Irin-ajo naa gba diẹ sii ju ọjọ meji lọ.
I mean it's very beautiful.	Mo tumọ si pe o lẹwa pupọ.
He loves them more than he loves himself.	O nifẹ wọn diẹ sii ju ti o nifẹ funrararẹ.
It is one of my favorites.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ayanfẹ mi.
We got solid after the first day.	A ti ri to lẹhin ọjọ akọkọ.
Do nothing.	Ṣe ko si ohun.
He is also running from himself.	O tun n sare lati ara rẹ.
I always have.	Emi ni nigbagbogbo.
In the bedroom.	Ninu yara yara.
But no one knows.	Ṣugbọn ko si ẹnikan ti o mọ.
At least three minutes.	O kere ju iṣẹju mẹta lọ.
The cold did not stop them.	Otutu naa ko da wọn duro.
It is a craft from here.	O jẹ iṣẹ ọwọ lati ibi.

I am doing well on my own.	Mo n ṣe daradara lori ara mi.
Can you make a mistake.	Ṣe o le ṣe aṣiṣe.
Not so great.	Kii ṣe nkan nla bẹẹ.
That is the same situation here.	Ipo kanna niyen nibi.
The law says so.	Ofin sọ bẹ.
I will definitely use this as you feel better.	Emi dajudaju yoo lo eyi bi o ṣe lero dara julọ.
I can’t agree on how you can.	Emi ko le gba lori bi o ṣe le.
I like that thing.	Mo fẹran ohun yẹn.
Did you help? 	Ṣe o ran?
he asked.	o beere.
And there are a few people out there who are a good team.	Ati pe awọn eniyan diẹ wa nibẹ ti wọn jẹ ẹgbẹ ti o dara.
But we do not understand without it.	Ṣugbọn a ko ni oye laisi rẹ.
The others went out.	Awọn miiran jade lọ.
That sounds great.	Ohun naa dara julọ.
He knows everything.	O si mọ ohun gbogbo.
Schools are needed for further education.	Awọn ile-iwe ni a nilo fun ẹkọ ti o tẹsiwaju.
Thus was born.	Bayi ni a bi.
You have to be here.	O ni lati wa nibi kan.
But he decided.	Ṣugbọn o pinnu.
Even he understands the hard time.	Paapaa o ni oye akoko lile.
We want to see it grow.	A fẹ lati rii pe o dagba.
Take it outside.	Mu u ni ita.
There are no observations in the city.	Ko si awọn ile akiyesi ni ilu naa.
This situation now calls everything into question.	Ipo yii bayi pe ohun gbogbo sinu ibeere.
In a good way, of course.	Ni ọna ti o dara, dajudaju.
Just look around in it.	O kan wo ni ayika ninu rẹ.
But they are there.	Ṣugbọn wọn wa nibẹ.
I just want some of your time.	Mo fẹ diẹ ninu akoko rẹ nikan.
I can't remember your last name, he said.	Emi ko le ranti orukọ ikẹhin rẹ, o sọ.
He did not see that.	Oun ko ri iyẹn.
He’s always trying to buy his way into something.	O n gbiyanju nigbagbogbo lati ra ọna rẹ sinu nkan kan.
Will see tomorrow.	Yoo wo ni ọla.
It was an old job for them.	O jẹ iṣẹ atijọ fun wọn.
Many are wondering, to say the least.	Pupọ wa ni iyalẹnu, lati sọ o kere ju.
I do not see this reason.	Nko ri idi eyi.
Some people have it.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ni o.
Homes are being built around the city.	Awọn ile ti wa ni ṣiṣe ni ayika ilu naa.
And yet he does not even know his name.	Ati sibẹsibẹ o ko paapaa mọ orukọ rẹ.
Everyone knows it will not happen.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ pe kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Call someone for help.	Pe ẹnikan fun iranlọwọ.
Making me take me to many beautiful places.	Ṣiṣe mi gba mi lọ si ọpọlọpọ awọn aaye lẹwa.
You can learn more here.	O le kọ ẹkọ diẹ sii nibi.
I have done so.	Mo ti ṣe bẹ.
So we are looking at it.	Nitorina a n wo o.
I get the past.	Mo gba ohun ti o ti kọja.
We are here for the same reason, obviously.	A wa nibi fun idi kanna, iyẹn han gbangba.
Time to get out of their lives.	Akoko lati jade ninu aye won.
You can take me away.	O le mi kuro.
Here, let us have our tea.	Nibi, jẹ ki a jẹ tii wa.
Especially for work.	Paapaa fun iṣẹ.
However, these are all difficult questions.	Sibẹsibẹ, awọn wọnyi ni gbogbo awọn ibeere ti o nira.
But the truth is something else.	Ṣugbọn otitọ jẹ nkan miiran.
He took the world, he crossed the road.	O gba aye, o kọja ni opopona.
In the end, we stopped.	Ni ipari, a duro.
It is his job.	Iṣẹ́ rẹ̀ ni.
They decide on the conditions for the first company.	Wọn pinnu lori awọn ipo fun ile-iṣẹ akọkọ.
They arrested them.	Wọn mu wọn.
Just go do it.	Kan lọ ṣe.
Please see my comments.	Jọwọ wo awọn ọrọ mi.
And this is not a good thing.	Ati pe eyi kii ṣe nkan ti o dara.
It just is.	O kan jẹ.
I don't even want to.	Emi ko paapaa fẹ.
We want to be with you.	A fẹ lati wa pẹlu rẹ.
I want to put something on the table.	Mo fẹ lati fi nkankan lori tabili.
The first three days are for only three days.	Awọn ọjọ mẹta akọkọ jẹ fun ọjọ mẹta nikan.
Sold as it is.	Ti ta bi o ṣe jẹ.
That means months.	Iyẹn tumọ si awọn oṣu.
That, in particular, may work.	Iyẹn, paapaa, le ṣiṣẹ.
I will recommend it to everyone.	Emi yoo so rẹ si gbogbo eniyan.
And she laughed.	Ati pe o rẹrin.
More information to come.	Alaye diẹ sii lati wa.
You think that's a good way.	O ro pe ọna ti o dara niyẹn.
I did not finish this last one at all.	Nko pari eyi ti o kẹhin rara.
This is not surprising, however.	Eyi kii ṣe iyalẹnu, sibẹsibẹ.
In a few minutes, he returned.	Ni iṣẹju diẹ, o pada.
That is for sure.	Iyẹn jẹ daju.
He could not be arrested.	A ko le mu u.
Maybe you will forget the thing even there.	Boya o yoo gbagbe nkan naa paapaa wa nibẹ.
He cannot force man.	Ko le fi agbara mu eniyan.
It is very easy to read.	O rọrun pupọ lati ka.
Absolutely not.	Ni otitọ rara.
But this is not the whole picture.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe gbogbo aworan naa.
I see so much of me in her as a mother.	Mo rii pupọ ninu mi ninu rẹ bi iya.
Of course they don’t like it.	Dajudaju wọn ko fẹran rẹ.
You will have to wear this on your head.	Iwọ yoo ni lati wọ eyi si ori rẹ.
It comes in a bad way.	O wa ni ọna buburu.
I am treating you tonight.	Mo n tọju rẹ ni alẹ oni.
He has always been with us.	O ti nigbagbogbo wa pẹlu wa.
What a game it is.	Kini ere ti o jẹ.
They seem to have no interest in the project.	Wọn dabi ẹni pe wọn ko nifẹ ninu iṣẹ naa.
You already suspect it.	O ti fura si ọ tẹlẹ.
He is risen.	O ti dide.
I will never forget that.	Emi ko ni gbagbe iyẹn.
What an angry situation.	Kini ipo binu.
All new or brand new and very surprising.	Gbogbo tuntun tabi tuntun tuntun ati iyalẹnu pupọ.
Just took off from there.	O kan mu kuro nibẹ.
They can do this.	Wọn le ṣe eyi.
I repaired myself.	Mo tun ara mi ṣe.
You know what happened to me.	O mọ ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ si mi.
We did not hear what the details were.	A ko gbọ kini awọn alaye naa jẹ.
Just a few games of mine to pass the time.	O kan ere diẹ ti mi lati kọja akoko naa.
I will find your likes and read books on them.	Emi yoo rii awọn ifẹ rẹ ati ka awọn iwe lori wọn.
And sell it.	Ati ki o ta o.
You cross that path yourself.	Iwọ kọja ni ọna yẹn funrararẹ.
He will figure this out.	Oun yoo ro eyi jade.
I only take a few minutes.	Mi nikan gba iṣẹju diẹ.
We feel we can be better than we are.	A lero pe a le dara ju ti a ti lọ.
Say what you need.	Sọ ohun ti o nilo.
There he is.	Nibẹ o tun wa.
It is easy to be hot.	O rọrun lati wa ni gbona.
He came into my office.	O wa sinu ọfiisi mi.
People would have known the family, depending on them.	Eniyan yoo ti mọ ebi, da lori wọn.
I understand why.	Mo loye idi.
What they ask of us is what we do.	Ohun ti wọn beere lọwọ wa ni ohun ti a ṣe.
Or do you ?.	Tabi ṣe o?.
That is something that no one can take away from him.	Iyẹn jẹ ohun kan ti ẹnikan ko le gba lọwọ rẹ.
They just are.	Wọn kan jẹ.
Go read.	Lọ ka.
They learned the lesson that way.	Wọn kọ ẹkọ naa ni ọna yẹn.
He also said no.	O tun sọ rara.
They all refuse to reject a love.	Gbogbo wọn kọ lati kọ ifẹ kan.
That’s where it comes from.	Iyẹn ni ibi ti o ti wa.
They are not allowed to live.	Wọn ko jẹ ki o wa laaye.
Eyes raised.	Oju oju ti gbe soke.
This did not happen at all.	Eyi ko ṣe rara.
I didn’t go into that.	Emi ko lọ sinu iyẹn.
I can’t remember the last time someone talked about that opportunity.	Emi ko le ranti igba ikẹhin ti ẹnikan sọrọ nipa ti o gbe anfani.
She has made her bed.	O ti ṣe ibusun rẹ.
We have to spend time with him, be with him, take him.	A ni lati lo akoko pẹlu rẹ, wa pẹlu rẹ, mu u.
It was my decision.	O jẹ ipinnu mi.
No one did.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o ṣe.
You have to take everything seriously.	O ni lati ṣe pataki ohun gbogbo.
Maybe it should be done before they move again.	Boya o yẹ ki o ṣe ṣaaju ki wọn to tun gbe.
I'm just saying wait for a while.	Mo n kan sọ duro fun igba diẹ.
So it may not be very beneficial.	Nitorina o le ma ṣe anfani pupọ.
They have no backs.	Wọn ko ni awọn ẹhin.
That's what people do.	Ohun ti eniyan ṣe niyẹn.
It’s not that you’re looking.	Kii ṣe pe o n wa.
I can’t even be friends.	Emi ko le paapaa jẹ ọrẹ.
That's not good enough.	Iyẹn ko dara to.
It is legal.	O jẹ ofin.
This is one of these weeks.	Eyi jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọsẹ wọnyi.
If you want to go, let's go.	Ti o ba fẹ lọ, jẹ ki a lọ.
Most of us know the game and the rules.	Ọpọlọpọ wa mọ ere ati awọn ofin.
That started with me.	Iyẹn bẹrẹ pẹlu mi.
There is no clear information.	Ko si alaye ti o han gbangba.
We have no reason at all.	A ko ni idi kan rara.
But it will not happen to me.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ si mi.
Make this life better.	Ṣe igbesi aye yii dara julọ.
This also applies to history.	Eyi kan si itan paapaa.
Let's pick this up in the morning.	Jẹ ki a gbe nkan yii ni owurọ.
New to look new.	Tuntun lati wo tuntun.
My question now is.	Ibeere mi ni bayi.
More things to forget.	Awọn nkan diẹ sii lati gbagbe.
A very small room.	Yara kekere kan kan gaan.
It is under the table.	O wa labẹ tabili.
I know they are not continuing.	Mo mọ pe wọn ko tẹsiwaju.
Putting your hand on your hair.	Ṣiṣe ọwọ rẹ lori irun ori rẹ.
I never got off this boat.	Emi ko bọ kuro ni ọkọ oju omi yii.
Something beautiful and powerful is happening.	Nkankan ti o lẹwa ati agbara n ṣẹlẹ.
These days, he will spend all day in bed.	Ni awọn ọjọ wọnyi, yoo lo gbogbo ọjọ ni ibusun.
I have seen a lot.	Mo ti ri pupọ.
They have won.	Wọn ti gba.
Not by anyone.	Kii ṣe nipasẹ ẹnikẹni.
I do not know if that is true or not.	Emi ko mọ boya otitọ ni iyẹn tabi rara.
You can see the minimum amount also.	O le rii iye ti o kere ju tun to.
At the very least.	O kere pupọ ni iyẹn.
You go, girls.	O lọ, awọn ọmọbirin.
I'm good at that.	Mo dara ni iyẹn.
It works really well.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara daradara.
We have never heard of such a thing before.	A ko tii gbọ iru nkan bayi tẹlẹ.
He had been dead for several hours, perhaps more than a day.	O ti ku fun ọpọlọpọ awọn wakati, boya diẹ sii ju ọjọ kan lọ.
It should be here.	O yẹ ki o wa nibi.
Think much higher than themselves.	Ronu pupọ ga ju ti ara wọn lọ.
Just do the right thing.	Nikan ṣe ohun ti o tọ.
Switch to with a.	Yipada si pẹlu kan.
For a few minutes, their eyes met.	Fun iṣẹju diẹ, oju wọn pade.
However, there is one thing you need to do here first.	Sibẹsibẹ, ohun kan wa ti o nilo lati ṣe nibi ni akọkọ.
They are all around.	Wọn wa ni ayika.
You can use the money to buy a house.	O le lo owo naa lati ra ile kan.
This whole place makes me jump.	Gbogbo ibi yii jẹ ki n fo.
I have found us.	Mo ti ri wa.
Do you think you will be back next year?	Ṣe o ro pe iwọ yoo tun wa ni ọdun ti n bọ?
I hope you enjoy it and come back soon.	Mo nireti pe o gbadun rẹ ki o tun pada wa laipẹ.
He will kill you because you can.	Oun yoo pa ọ nitori pe o le.
I have caught them.	Mo ti di wọn mọ.
Few remember his name today.	Diẹ ni o ranti orukọ rẹ loni.
Not fun.	Ko fun.
I have a lot to do.	Mo ni ọpọlọpọ lati ṣe.
You are not my child.	Iwọ kii ṣe ọmọ mi.
But it will not stop.	Ṣugbọn kii yoo duro.
That will not change.	Iyẹn kii yoo yipada.
You should know better.	O yẹ ki o mọ dara julọ.
And for the first time in public.	Ati fun igba akọkọ ni gbangba.
They just want their children to come back.	Wọn kan fẹ ki awọn ọmọ wọn pada.
Look at it and remember.	Wo o ki o ranti.
These foods are too hot to eat.	Awọn ounjẹ wọnyi gbona pupọ lati jẹ.
The name is there on the end of it.	Orukọ naa wa nibẹ lori ipari ti inu rẹ.
I want it to open up to me.	Mo fẹ rẹ lati ṣii soke si mi.
The world is not in such a state.	Aye ko tii wa ni iru ipo bayi.
With that one man.	Pẹlu ọkunrin kan yẹn.
We went to the city.	A lọ si ilu naa.
Most of them are great people.	Pupọ ninu wọn jẹ eniyan nla.
It worked again.	O tun ṣiṣẹ lẹẹkansi.
Which they don’t get on earth, by the way.	Eyi ti wọn ko gba lori ile aye, nipasẹ ọna.
My understanding of the.	Mi oye ti awọn.
He began to run past me.	O bẹrẹ lati sare kọja mi.
I try to think things are wrong.	Mo gbiyanju lati ro ero ohun ti ko tọ.
You want to go by bus.	O fẹ lati lọ nipasẹ ọkọ akero.
We will not talk about it.	A kii yoo sọrọ nipa rẹ.
I know these things.	Mo mọ nkan wọnyi.
We have to be able to help each other.	A ni lati ni anfani lati ran ara wa lọwọ.
I can't take your picture.	Nko le ya aworan re.
They were told to light their fire.	Won ni ki won mu ina won.
He looked back.	O wo pada.
I let the cat out.	Mo jẹ ki ologbo naa jade.
I see myself as a gift.	Mo rii ara bi ẹbun.
Have you tried them ?.	Njẹ o ti gbiyanju wọn?.
The way people talk to you pays nothing.	Ọna ti eniyan n ba ọ sọrọ ko san nkankan.
There is no understanding for the man what to expect.	Ko si oye fun ọkunrin naa ohun ti o nireti.
He is dead as man can get.	O ti ku bi eniyan ṣe le gba.
Put your hand on your head.	Fi ọwọ rẹ si ori rẹ.

He did that and they continued to try to get away.	O ṣe iyẹn ati pe wọn tẹsiwaju lati gbiyanju lati lọ kuro.

Something more here.	Nkankan diẹ sii nibi.
Well, they came to kill me.	O dara, wọn wa lati pa mi.

However, yours is not the case.	Sibẹsibẹ, tirẹ kii ṣe iyẹn.
It is best to bring lunch to a full lunch.	O dara julọ lati mu ounjẹ ọsan wa sinu ounjẹ ọsan ti o kun.
The world will be a better place.	Aye yoo jẹ aaye ti o dara julọ.
Not so much, it seemed.	Ko pupọ, o dabi enipe.

They are right.	Wọn tọ.
I'll have to go to the store, and start all over again.	Emi yoo ni lati lọ si ile itaja, ki o tun bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.

And such decision methods.	Ati iru awọn ọna ipinnu.
Maybe there is also, in one.	Boya o tun wa, ni ọkan.
It is early in the year.	O ti wa ni kutukutu odun.
He turned his head on me and fell asleep.	O yi ori si mi o si sun.
Much work has been done, however.	Ọpọlọpọ iṣẹ ni a ṣe, sibẹsibẹ.
You can't hear it anymore.	O ko le gbọ rẹ mọ.
It was his last life to reveal himself.	O jẹ aye ikẹhin rẹ lati fi ara rẹ han.
My husband can use one.	Ọkọ mi le lo ọkan.

One by one the young men went to bed.	Ọkan nipa ọkan awọn ọdọ lọ si ibusun.

He could not sit around doing anything.	Ko le joko ni ayika ṣe ohunkohun.
If it’s true, it can’t stay here.	Ti o ba jẹ otitọ, ko le duro nibi.
But they’ve been pretty good to work with.	Ṣugbọn wọn ti dara julọ lati ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.

Not a woman.	Ko obinrin.
I hope someone has something in their hands.	Mo nireti pe ẹnikan ni nkan kan ni ọwọ wọn.
I think that's hot.	Mo ro pe iyẹn gbona.
You’re right, of course.	O tọ, dajudaju.

This is the place to be, the place to see.	Eyi ni aaye lati wa, aaye lati rii.
Maybe even leave it.	Boya paapaa fi i silẹ.
This place is nice and clean.	Ibi yi jẹ dara ati ki o mọ.
With its great strength.	Pẹlu okun nla rẹ.
It is now yours.	O ti di tirẹ ni bayi.
Out here, he says.	Jade nibi, o sọ.
Years spent for nothing.	Awọn ọdun ti a lo fun ohunkohun.
Nothing you think.	Ko si ohun ti o ro.
Your whole environment is occupied by others.	Gbogbo ayika rẹ ni awọn miiran gbe.
I have to continue to move.	Mo ni lati tẹsiwaju lati gbe.
Just after he left, the conversation resumed.	O kan lẹhin ti o lọ, ọrọ naa tun bẹrẹ.
Will be here.	Yoo wa nibi.
You can call anything you want.	O le pe ohunkohun ti o ba fẹ.
Maybe just as well.	Boya o kan bi daradara.

You don’t see them very long.	O ko wo wọn gun pupọ.
But it doesn’t matter to them.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe pataki fun wọn.
I have a meeting to reach.	Mo ni ipade kan lati de ọdọ.
Everyone understands that this is not a love affair.	Gbogbo eniyan loye pe eyi kii ṣe ifẹ ifẹ.
There is no other reason to stay outside in this weather.	Ko si idi miiran lati duro si ita ni oju ojo yii.
We will consider these points here as much as possible.	A yoo ṣe akiyesi awọn aaye wọnyi nibi bi o ti ṣee ṣe.
This makes us a little nervous.	Eyi jẹ ki a da ori diẹ.
He said he had a good reason to do so.	O sọ pe o ni idi to dara lati ṣe.
I will get back to you on that.	Emi yoo pada si ọ lori iyẹn.
I hate getting up early.	Mo korira dide ni kutukutu.
We have a promise now.	A ni ileri bayi.
The mother decided to go home from school.	Iya pinnu lati ile-iwe ile.
Very good year for clothes.	Odun to dara pupọ fun awọn aṣọ.
And save the date.	Ki o si fi awọn ọjọ.
Are you writing a letter?	Ṣe o n kọ lẹta kan bi?

Who knows why we last so long.	Tani o mọ idi ti a fi pẹ to.

If a bad game comes to play, they do it.	Ti ere buburu kan ba wa lati ṣe, wọn ṣe e.

They love their children very much.	Wọn nifẹ awọn ọmọ wọn gidigidi.
We must ensure that young people are educated.	A gbọdọ rii daju pe awọn ọdọ ti kọ ẹkọ.
At night.	Ni alẹ.

He drove very fast.	O wakọ sare pupọ.

Their eyes met and they held each other.	Oju wọn pade ati di ara wọn mu.
They like to eat there.	Wọn fẹran lati jẹun nibẹ.
I want that for me.	Mo fe iyẹn fun mi.
You need every opportunity to be on your side.	O nilo gbogbo anfani lati wa ni ẹgbẹ rẹ.
Many beautiful people we know do not even have one!	Ọpọlọpọ awọn lẹwa eniyan ti a mọ ko paapaa ni ọkan!
I don't know who he is.	Emi ko mọ ẹni ti o jẹ.
We are only aware of two types of previous work.	A ni o wa nikan mọ ti meji iru ti tẹlẹ iṣẹ.
What is it all about ?.	Kini gbogbo nipa ?.
They’re writing something there.	Wọn n kọ nkan silẹ nibẹ.
I can know something that can help you.	Mo le mọ nkan ti o le ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ.
But an environment that fears him.	Ṣugbọn ayika ti o bẹru rẹ.
He was pretty good at it.	O si wà lẹwa dara ni o.
Can you think of anything ?.	Ṣe o le ronu ohunkohun ?.
It looks like a family.	O dabi idile.
I have not.	Emi ko ti i.
The story only goes down from this point.	Awọn itan nikan lọ si isalẹ lati aaye yi.
In this case, we must start again.	Ni idi eyi, a gbọdọ bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
He never laughed back.	Ko rẹrin pada.
I am very tall.	Mo ga pupọ.
I could have been there with him.	Mo ti le ti wa nibẹ pẹlu rẹ.
We must pay a fee.	A gbọdọ san owo kan.

Together we can do !.	Papọ a le ṣe!.

You have this new baby to think about.	O ni ọmọ tuntun yii lati ronu nipa.

Until you finish it, you will never have that story.	Titi ti o fi pari rẹ, iwọ kii yoo ni itan yẹn rara.

It always changes.	O nigbagbogbo yipada.
But it was his drink.	Ṣugbọn ohun mimu rẹ ni.
Her sister is married.	Arabinrin rẹ ti ṣe igbeyawo.
They are not your questions.	Wọn kii ṣe awọn ibeere rẹ.
Everything after that sounds the same.	Ohun gbogbo lẹhin eyi dun kanna.
Every year, young people visit the city.	Ni gbogbo ọdun, awọn ọdọ lọ si ilu naa.
Making questions.	Ṣiṣe awọn ibeere.
It’s like nothing they’ve ever seen before.	O dabi ohunkohun ti wọn ti ri tẹlẹ.
Now let me ask you a question.	Bayi jẹ ki n beere ibeere kan fun ọ.

You can't talk away.	O ko le sọrọ kuro.
He ran past the main car.	O sare kọja ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ akọkọ.
Some methods seem to exist to this day.	Diẹ ninu awọn ọna dabi pe o wa titi di oni.
We want them to let us be ourselves.	A fẹ ki wọn jẹ ki a jẹ ara wa nikan.
She loves to draw.	O nifẹ lati fa.

You can’t get out of a troubled one.	O ko le jade kuro ni ọkan ti o ni wahala.

To find out more.	Lati wa diẹ sii.
So, therefore, money forever.	Nitorina, nitorina, owo lailai.
He’d never had his life beaten in the face.	O fẹ ko ni igbesi aye rẹ ti a lu ni oju.
How beautiful!	Bawo ni lẹwa!

Maybe he will tell me that his life will kill me.	Boya oun yoo sọ fun mi pe aye rẹ yoo pa mi.
I woke up early in the morning.	Mo ji ni kutukutu owurọ.

You will make a lot of friends here.	Iwọ yoo ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrẹ nibi.
In the end, it may not work for you.	Ni ipari, o le ma ṣiṣẹ fun ọ.
I was too late, he said.	Mo ti pẹ ju, o sọ.
And this is very important.	Ati pe eyi ṣe pataki pupọ.
So we can’t stop either.	Nitorina a ko le da boya.
That is incredibly beautiful.	Iyẹn jẹ iyalẹnu lẹwa.
Still holding hands.	Si tun di ọwọ mu.
And we came again.	Ati pe a wa lẹẹkansi.
Well and good.	Daradara ati ki o dara.
They have to ask for everything.	Wọn ni lati beere ohun gbogbo.
It can not be neither.	Ko le jẹ bẹni.
Okay wait a minute.	O dara duro iṣẹju kan.

I want to make time.	Mo fẹ lati ṣe akoko.
The lights went out yesterday.	Awọn ina ti jade lana.
Everyone is watching.	Gbogbo eniyan n wo.
What we need is a time plan.	Ohun ti a nilo ni eto akoko kan.
There is no good reason for all these important rules.	Ko si idi to dara fun gbogbo awọn ofin pataki wọnyi.
Have decisions to say.	Ni awọn ipinnu lati sọ.

They feel they have enough.	Wọn lero pe wọn ni to.
Just keep your feet on fire.	O kan pa ẹsẹ rẹ mọ ni ina.
I looked at the room.	Mo wo yara naa.
There is something wrong with you.	Aṣiṣe rẹ wa.
There is another truth, beyond what we see with our eyes.	Otitọ miiran tun wa, kọja ohun ti a rii pẹlu oju wa.
They have a lot of stuff.	Wọn ni nkan pupọ.
Others only seem to know his first name.	Awọn miiran nikan dabi pe wọn mọ orukọ akọkọ rẹ.
That was hard for the whole team.	Iyẹn jẹ lile fun gbogbo ẹgbẹ wa.
There is no way.	Ọna ko si.
From his letter, he appears to be living on another planet.	Lati lẹta rẹ, o han pe o n gbe lori aye miiran.
It makes him hot.	O mu u gbona.
Where is that? 	Nibo ni yẹn?

You have to call.	O ni lati pe.
You can get that, whatever it is.	O le gba iyẹn, ohunkohun ti o jẹ.
I have no problems with this.	Emi ko ni awọn iṣoro pẹlu eyi.
You must know this.	O gbọdọ mọ eyi.
By the time the baby is born, you will have learned what love really is.	Ni akoko ti a bi ọmọ naa, iwọ yoo kọ kini ifẹ jẹ gaan.
Treat yourself as needed.	Mu ara wa bi o ti nilo.
Dogs for the company.	Awọn aja fun ile-iṣẹ.
You are wrong.	O ṣe aṣiṣe.
I don’t think you can do it.	Emi ko ro pe o le ṣe.
We will talk to them.	A yoo ba wọn sọrọ.
I remember every single face here.	Mo ranti gbogbo oju kan nibi.
But maybe we can steal them.	Ṣugbọn boya a le ji wọn.
I stopped him on the road.	Mo da a duro ni opopona.
He has no sister.	Ko ni arabinrin.
We grew as much as most of it.	A dagba pupọ bi ọpọlọpọ ninu rẹ.
The music is doing its job.	Orin naa n ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
He said who was behind it.	O sọ ẹni ti o wa ni ẹhin.
Or at least one thing.	Tabi o kere ju ohun kan.
It’s not that you do too much in either.	Kii ṣe pe o ṣe pupọ ninu boya.
It's just that it tastes really good.	O kan pe o dun gaan, dara gaan.
He went home.	O lọ si ile.
I help you get on your feet and get out of there.	Mo ṣe iranlọwọ fun ọ lati gbe lori ẹsẹ rẹ ki o jade kuro nibẹ.
Hand grips make it easy to lift up and down your body.	Awọn mimu ọwọ jẹ ki o rọrun lati gbe soke ati isalẹ ara rẹ.

Most people do not live well.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ko gbe daradara.
Tell a story with him.	Sọ itan kan pẹlu rẹ.
What it looks like.	Ohun ti o dabi.
You can work with that.	O le ṣiṣẹ pẹlu iyẹn.
And he found out that his sister was not well.	Ati pe o rii pe arabinrin rẹ ko dara.
This is your favorite song.	Eyi ni orin ayanfẹ rẹ.
She was clean and well dressed.	O wẹ o si wọ aṣọ ti o dara julọ.
You look at your watch	O wo aago rẹ
Only, things went wrong.	Nikan, ohun ti lọ ti ko tọ.
For all time, there is a reason.	Fun gbogbo akoko, idi kan wa.
What we promised.	Ohun ti a ṣe ileri.
If so, it is too late.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, o ti pẹ ju.
Like, you don't have to take off your clothes.	Bii, ko ni lati bọ aṣọ rẹ kuro.
Perhaps none of these works.	Boya ko si ọkan ninu awọn iṣẹ wọnyi.
Things will be difficult, but you will get through it.	Awọn nkan yoo nira, ṣugbọn iwọ yoo gba nipasẹ rẹ.
Life for a living.	Igbesi aye fun igbesi aye kan.
Everything they need, they will have.	Ohun gbogbo ti wọn nilo, wọn yoo ni.
It will make our lives a lot easier.	Yoo jẹ ki igbesi aye wa rọrun pupọ.
I really want to talk to you.	Mo fẹ lati ba ọ sọrọ gaan.
But it is not true.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe otitọ.
But big money at all.	Ṣugbọn owo nla rara.
The police have seized the items.	Awọn ọlọpa ti gba awọn nkan naa.
But the police did.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọlọpa ṣe.
One of two sure.	Ọkan ninu awọn meji daju.
Do whatever you do.	Ṣe ohunkohun ti o ṣe.
She laughed a lot.	O rẹrin pupọ.
Agreement is final.	Adehun ni ipari.
Let's just think about that for a minute.	Jẹ ki a kan ronu nipa iyẹn fun iṣẹju kan.
I just want to know if people say that or not.	Mo kan fẹ lati mọ boya awọn eniyan ba sọ iyẹn tabi rara.
Beautiful weather.	Oju ojo lẹwa.
You have to hear this.	O ni lati gbọ eyi.
Love is one of a kind.	Ifẹ jẹ ọkan ninu iru kan.
They were given many gifts.	Awọn ẹbun pupọ ni wọn fun.
You can find many here.	O le wa ọpọlọpọ nibi.
We cannot reach out to touch and be convinced.	A ko le de ọdọ lati fi ọwọ kan ati ni idaniloju.
No one will ever do that.	Ko si ẹnikan ti yoo ṣe iyẹn lailai.
Here, when we look.	Nibi, nigba ti a wo.
Okay, he said.	O dara, o sọ.
Naturally, if you walk on it, it will do so.	Nipa ti ara, ti o ba n rin lori rẹ, yoo ṣe bẹ.
There must be an opportunity to be a woman.	Anfani kan gbọdọ wa lati jẹ obinrin.
And too long.	Ati ki o to gun ju.
He is the only one.	Oun nikan ni.
Everything went well.	Ohun gbogbo ti lọ dara.

He said he would see what he could see.	O sọ pe oun yoo rii ohun ti oun le rii.
You finish everything you start.	O pari ohun gbogbo ti o bẹrẹ.
We do not know.	A ko mọ.
Time to eat breakfast.	Akoko lati jẹun owurọ.
The new company will, however, have to do without it.	Ile-iṣẹ tuntun yoo, sibẹsibẹ, ni lati ṣe laisi rẹ.
They will move.	Won yoo gbe.
I was sent to see the place for the last time.	A ti ran mi lati wo ibi fun igba ikẹhin.
If they get to see them they will benefit from their decision.	Ti wọn ba gba lati wo wọn yoo ni anfani lati ipinnu wọn.
Students need to know how to swim.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe nilo lati mọ bi wọn ṣe le we.
Neither of them really understood me.	Bẹni ninu wọn ko loye mi gaan.
There has been a lot of talk about that idea.	Ọrọ pupọ ti wa lori imọran naa.
You do not understand why he is there.	O ko loye idi ti o fi wa nibẹ.
If you are in the area, stop.	Ti o ba wa ni agbegbe, da duro.
Students have changed seats.	Awọn ọmọ ile-iwe ti yipada awọn ijoko.
Promise them whatever you want.	Ṣe ileri fun wọn ohunkohun ti o fẹ.

This room is special, obviously.	Yara yi jẹ pataki, o han ni.
But three times.	Sugbon ni igba mẹta.
We accept that it is wrong.	A gba pe o jẹ aṣiṣe.
I have seen him angry and upset before.	Mo ti ri i binu ati inu rẹ ṣaaju ki o to.
Maybe there are several reasons.	Boya awọn idi pupọ wa.
You always keep your promises.	O nigbagbogbo pa awọn ileri rẹ mọ.
It does not have good news.	O ko ni iroyin ti o dara.
They are making a mistake.	Wọn n ṣe aṣiṣe.
Every word is true.	Gbogbo ọrọ ni otitọ.
I hope you like it.	Mo nireti pe iwọ yoo fẹ.
And he went.	Ati pe o lọ.
I didn’t cut myself that day.	Emi ko ge mi ni ọjọ yẹn.
I understand why you have to do this.	Mo loye idi ti o fi ni lati ṣe eyi.
You have done it.	O ti ṣe e.
It was a great surprise to her parents.	O jẹ iyalẹnu nla si awọn obi rẹ.

I know it will be good.	Mo mọ pe yoo dara.
Look and learn.	Wo ki o kọ ẹkọ.

The device makes high-rise buildings possible.	Ẹrọ naa jẹ ki awọn ile giga ṣee ṣe.
He never left the job.	O ko kuro ni iṣẹ naa.
And even life.	Ati pe igbesi aye paapaa.
None of the gifts had names on them.	Ko si ọkan ninu awọn ẹbun ti o ni awọn orukọ lori wọn.
Drink more than you think you need.	Mu diẹ sii ju ti o ro pe o nilo.
He is very angry.	O binu pupọ.
The two go together, at least that's what you believe.	Awọn mejeeji lọ papọ, o kere ju iyẹn ni ohun ti o gbagbọ.
He hardened my hands and looked at me.	O di ọwọ́ mi le, o si wo mi soke.
He told me he called the police.	O sọ fun mi pe o pe ọlọpa.
But just that.	Sugbon o kan ti o.
Everything worked great.	Ohun gbogbo ti ṣiṣẹ nla.
This is not a new report.	Eyi kii ṣe iroyin tuntun.
All that matters is the game.	Gbogbo ohun ti o ṣe pataki ni ere.
We have one meeting a month.	A ni ipade kan ni oṣu kan.
Hold your hand.	Duro ọwọ rẹ.
I had to change clothes first.	Mo ni lati yi aṣọ pada ni akọkọ.
I will send you the information in a few weeks.	Emi yoo fi alaye naa ranṣẹ si ọ ni ọsẹ diẹ.
I just can't.	Mi o kan ko le.
I am looking for you.	Mo n wa e.
But that is not what happened.	Ṣugbọn kii ṣe ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Nothing will happen if people do not do something.	Ko si ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ ti eniyan ko ba ṣe nkankan.
Or they are not, and it is not.	Tabi wọn ko, ati pe kii ṣe.
It also looks like a tree.	O tun dabi igi.
We need another way.	A nilo ọna miiran.
It keeps your tone as it is.	O tọju ohun orin rẹ gaan bi o ṣe jẹ.
I want you through me.	Mo fẹ ọ nipasẹ mi.
Note that some information may be included in both books.	Ṣe akiyesi pe diẹ ninu alaye le wa ninu awọn iwe mejeeji.
You may have given him time.	O le ti fun u ni akoko.
He was tired, he thought to himself.	Yoo ti re, o ro ninu ara re.
He knew that no one could hear him.	O mọ pe ko si ẹnikan ti o le gbọ ohun.
I do not think it is possible but it is possible.	Emi ko ro pe o ṣee ṣe ṣugbọn o ṣee ṣe.
This may be more true to you.	Eyi le ni otitọ diẹ si rẹ.
I changed.	Mo yipada.
Like your mother.	Bi iya re.
He turned to what was standing in front of him.	O yipada si ohun ti o duro ni iwaju rẹ.
We cannot become human without human life around us.	A ko le di eniyan laisi aye eniyan ni ayika wa.
Not many opportunities for him to go.	Ko ọpọlọpọ awọn anfani fun u lati lọ.
At that time everyone will be at his feet.	Ni akoko yẹn gbogbo eniyan yoo wa ni ẹsẹ tirẹ.
I don’t think we can get out of the way we wear.	Emi ko ro pe a le jade ni ọna ti a wọ.
Cats, see help.	Ologbo, iranlọwọ wo.
The children's rooms are upstairs.	Awọn yara ti awọn ọmọde wa ni oke aja.
I had never noticed before how beautiful it was, how handsome it was.	Emi ko ṣe akiyesi ṣaaju bi o ṣe lẹwa, bawo ni ọwọ rẹ ṣe dara to.
People have forgotten about that.	Eniyan ti gbagbe nipa iyẹn.
We have to do this every summer.	A ni lati ṣe eyi ni gbogbo igba ooru.
We need to get them all here.	A nilo lati gba gbogbo wọn nibi.
Now is not the time for many words.	Bayi kii ṣe akoko fun ọpọlọpọ awọn ọrọ.
See if we can figure out where it went.	Wo boya a le mọ ibiti o ti lọ silẹ.
His head reached very far towards his seat.	Ori rẹ de pupọ julọ ọna si ijoko rẹ.
I do not know myself.	Emi ko mọ ara mi.
So the same should apply to you.	Nitorina kanna yẹ ki o kan si ọ.
He has helped us all so far.	O ti ṣe iranlọwọ fun gbogbo wa titi di akoko yii.
They go together.	Wọn lọ papọ.
We worked together until he dropped me.	A ṣiṣẹ papọ titi o fi sọ mi silẹ.
Find all my vacations.	Wa gbogbo isinmi mi.
Great guy with a big heart.	Eniyan nla ti o ni ọkan nla.

I got up and ran out of the room.	Mo dide, mo si sare jade ninu yara naa.
I am very happy with their work.	Inu mi dun pupọ pẹlu iṣẹ wọn.
They will be killed.	Wọn yoo pa.
So you are right.	Nitorina o tọ.
But he is in trouble.	Sugbon o wa ninu wahala.
We ride in a bus and a bus.	A gun ni a akero ati ki o kan akero.
This water problem does not stop.	Iṣoro omi yii ko duro jẹ.
You just want to get back to work.	O kan fẹ lati pada si iṣẹ.
He understood beyond his years.	O loye ju awọn ọdun rẹ lọ.
We do not like that store.	A ko fẹran ile itaja yẹn.
Things are not so simple.	Awọn nkan ko tun rọrun.
We went over it and over it.	A lọ lori rẹ ati lori rẹ.
I know you a little.	Mo mọ ọ diẹ.
He is not dead.	Ko tii ku.
So, we did.	Nitorina, a ṣe.
Your family is not perfect without you.	Idile rẹ ko pe laisi rẹ.
The room is full of fire.	Yara naa kun fun ina.
I know it’s just a matter of time.	Mo mọ pe o kan ọrọ kan ti akoko.
It includes many applications.	O pẹlu ọpọlọpọ awọn ohun elo.
Have you and your sister recently split up?	Njẹ iwọ ati arabinrin rẹ ti ya kuro laipẹ bi?
Of course, one can do such a thing.	Dajudaju, ọkan le ṣe iru nkan bẹẹ.
He did not come back.	Ko pada wa.
It is our work.	O jẹ iṣẹ ṣiṣe wa.
Sometimes it happens that way.	Nigba miiran o ṣẹlẹ ni ọna yẹn.
That's the only thing they can do.	Iyẹn nikan ni ohun ti wọn le ṣe.
The sister was very nice that way.	Arabinrin naa dara pupọ ni ọna yẹn.
That happened again.	Iyẹn tun ṣẹlẹ.
It is true or not.	O jẹ otitọ tabi rara.
He was very good with his father.	O dara pupọ pẹlu baba rẹ.
I left them in my bag.	Mo fi wọn silẹ ninu apo mi.
Next week is your time.	Ni ọsẹ to nbọ o jẹ akoko tirẹ.

They want to buy a new dog.	Wọn fẹ ra aja tuntun kan.
You can learn here if you want.	O le kọ ẹkọ nibi ti o ba fẹ.
But he was wrong.	Ṣugbọn o ṣe aṣiṣe.
That’s how my heart will work.	Iyẹn ni ọkan mi yoo ṣe ṣiṣẹ.
That's a good thing.	Ohun to dara niyẹn.
His face was as clear as water.	Oju rẹ mọ bi omi.
That did not stop him.	Iyẹn ko da a duro.
You're as much a child as you ever were.	Ti o ba bi Elo a ọmọ bi o lailai wà.
When you see it.	Nigbati o ba ri i.
He was here yesterday	O wa nibi lana
As in, appear only to me.	Bi ninu, han nikan si mi.
Let us do so forever.	Jẹ ki a ṣe bẹ lailai.
I do not hate it.	Emi ko korira rẹ.
We turned to return.	A yipada lati pada.
It has a lot to say about everything.	O ni ọpọlọpọ lati sọ nipa ohun gbogbo.
Not for us.	Kii ṣe fun wa.
This can happen completely.	Eyi ti o le ṣẹlẹ patapata.
Now let's get back to the course.	Bayi jẹ ki ká pada si awọn dajudaju.
There is still a lot to say, but you can wait.	Ọpọlọpọ tun wa lati sọ, ṣugbọn o le duro.
I need to find something to fill my days.	Mo nilo lati wa nkan lati kun awọn ọjọ mi.
That is, if you work tonight.	Iyẹn ni, ti o ba ṣiṣẹ ni alẹ oni.
It's in it.	O ni ninu rẹ.
You don't think so.	O ko ro bẹ.
I know it's possible.	Mo mọ pe o ṣee ṣe.
Do it with me.	Ṣe pẹlu mi.
He let go of the door handle.	O jẹ ki o lọ ti ọwọ ilẹkun.
Stay with your man.	Duro ti ọkunrin rẹ.
If you are good, forget about it.	Ti o ba dara, gbagbe nipa rẹ.
This is not possible.	Eyi ko ṣee ṣe.
All this has changed.	Gbogbo eyi ti yipada.
I will be in the office if you need me.	Emi yoo wa ni ọfiisi ti o ba nilo mi.
It has so many ways.	O ni awọn ọna pupọ ju.
I have no chance.	Emi ko ni anfani.
Our next day will be next week.	Ọjọ ti nbọ wa yoo jẹ ọsẹ lẹhin.
It's time to dump her.	O to akoko lati lọ.
Just stop at.	O kan duro ni.
He did not think that would be a problem.	Ko ro pe iyẹn yoo jẹ iṣoro.
Maintaining a schedule is what gets us here.	Mimu eto ṣiṣe jẹ ohun ti o gba wa nibi.
I have left to try to keep any of it at this point.	Mo ti fi silẹ lati gbiyanju lati tọju eyikeyi ninu rẹ ni aaye yii.
Good to like what you want.	O dara lati fẹ ohun ti o fẹ.
If you want to do something you can have something else.	Ti o ba fẹ ṣe nkan ti o le ni nkan miiran.
Things are similar.	Awọn nkan jẹ iru.
And once they were caught, there was no way back.	Ati ni kete ti wọn ti mu wọn, ko si ọna pada.
This is a very important question.	Eyi jẹ ibeere pataki pupọ.
I try to look my best in everything.	Mo gbiyanju lati wo ohun ti o dara julọ ninu ohun gbogbo.
It does not have to be difficult.	Ko ni lati nira.
I laid him on his bed and he slept for a few minutes.	Mo ti gbe e lori ibusun rẹ ati pe o sun ni iṣẹju diẹ.
I work with him.	Mo ṣiṣẹ pẹlu rẹ.
He did not let go.	Ko jẹ ki lọ.
They know they have a lost hand.	Wọn mọ pe wọn ni ọwọ ti o padanu.
I fetch water to fill.	Mo gbe omi lati kun.
We made a lot of games.	A ṣe ọpọlọpọ awọn ere.
He was not afraid.	Oun ko bẹru.
They love to tell the story of how they met.	Wọn nifẹ lati sọ itan ti bi wọn ṣe pade.
Or maybe with.	Tabi boya pẹlu.
Not that it is not educational.	Kii ṣe pe kii ṣe ẹkọ.
No one can understand what you are saying.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o le loye ohun ti o sọ.
But it does not feel like work already.	Ṣugbọn ko rilara bi iṣẹ tẹlẹ.
Until that night.	Titi di alẹ yẹn.
I was convinced.	Mo da a loju.
You think if someone knows, it has to be yours.	O ro pe ti ẹnikan ba mọ, o ni lati jẹ tirẹ.
I think that is.	Mo ro pe iyẹn ni.
That is always in front of my heart.	Iyẹn nigbagbogbo wa ni iwaju ti ọkan mi.
I want people to care.	Mo fẹ ki eniyan tọju.
I try to write down.	Mo gbiyanju lati kọ si isalẹ.
And now, we hope you enjoy your meal.	Ati ni bayi, a nireti pe o gbadun ounjẹ rẹ.
This is not something you can write down.	Eyi kii ṣe nkan ti o le kọ silẹ.
And friend to everyone.	Ati ọrẹ si gbogbo eniyan.

I may be the last.	Mo le jẹ kẹhin.
But too little for man.	Sugbon ju kekere fun eniyan.
No, it can't be.	Rara, ko le jẹ.
We talked and talked.	A sọrọ ati sọrọ.
I want to see my son.	Mo fẹ lati ri ọmọ mi.
It's for my dog.	O wa fun aja mi.
But his work is very good.	Ṣugbọn iṣẹ rẹ dara pupọ.
Without it, they would not be able to work.	Laisi rẹ, wọn kii yoo ni anfani lati ṣiṣẹ.
Obviously you have.	O han pe o ni.
It was the same with the dogs.	O je kanna pẹlu awọn aja.
It can be anyone.	O le jẹ ẹnikẹni.
It has been a long time.	O ti wa ni igba pipẹ.
It didn’t change much with it.	Ko yipada pupọ pẹlu rẹ lọ.
But the woman is another matter.	Ṣugbọn obinrin naa jẹ ọrọ miiran.
Maybe that's what he will do.	Boya ohun ti yoo ṣe niyẹn.
They can't stay here long.	Wọn ko le duro nibi pipẹ.
Your house is downstairs.	Ile rẹ wa ni isalẹ ita.
I hate when you do this.	Mo korira nigbati o ṣe eyi.
Others think in this way too.	Awọn miiran n ronu ni ọna yii paapaa.
A beautiful family.	A lẹwa ebi.
I was under him.	A ti mi labẹ rẹ.

You may feel just your hair.	O le lero pe o kan irun ori rẹ.
It almost killed me.	O fẹrẹ pa mi.

This is more of a problem for me.	Eyi jẹ iṣoro diẹ sii fun mi.

You can drink.	O le mu.
I would like to invite you to a party.	Emi yoo fẹ lati pe ọ si ibi ayẹyẹ kan.

It is as important as any other.	O ṣe pataki bi eyikeyi miiran.
Everything came out great.	Ohun gbogbo wa jade nla.

It looks like it has changed.	O dabi ẹni pe o ti yipada.
Just, well, everything else about the game.	O kan, daradara, ohun gbogbo miiran nipa ere naa.

And of course that makes the story a great story.	Ati pe dajudaju iyẹn jẹ ki itan naa jẹ itan nla.
You are out of this world.	O ti jade ninu aye yi.

All the way.	Gbogbo ọna gbogbo.
It was my first time away from home.	O jẹ igba akọkọ mi kuro ni ile.
Most children have not yet gone to school.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ọmọde ko tii lọ si ile-iwe.
I hate to see such a thing.	Mo korira lati wo iru nkan bẹẹ.
But the buyer shows very little.	Ṣugbọn ẹniti o ra ra han pupọ diẹ.
I knew my boys would love them.	Mo mọ pe awọn ọmọkunrin mi yoo nifẹ wọn.
I spent a lot of time with my parents.	Mo lo ọpọlọpọ akoko pẹlu awọn obi mi.
Some know this better than others.	Diẹ ninu awọn mọ eyi ju awọn miiran lọ.
I never made that statement to anyone.	Emi ko ṣe iru alaye yẹn si ẹnikan rara.
It can also work.	O tun le ṣiṣẹ.
I know this place well.	Mo mọ ibi yii daradara.
They look at the man honestly.	Wọn wo ọkunrin naa ni otitọ.
To see if it has changed.	Lati rii boya o ti yipada.
It works fine on my device.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara lori ẹrọ mi.
A word is hard to come by.	Ọrọ kan jẹ gidigidi lati wa pẹlu.
I remember my first night at these trees.	Mo ranti alẹ akọkọ mi ni awọn igi wọnyi.
You are here now it is not good to let it go.	O wa nibi bayi o ko dara lati jẹ ki o lọ.
All the weather information you need is available on your phone.	Gbogbo alaye oju ojo ti o nilo wa lori foonu rẹ.
The newspaper arrived today.	Iwe iroyin de loni.
You see you have food and rest.	O rii pe o ni ounjẹ ati isinmi.
Without me there is something in this picture.	Laisi mi nkan kan wa ninu aworan yii.
Promise me you will never set foot outside of this place.	Ṣe ileri fun mi pe iwọ kii yoo gbe ẹsẹ si ita ibi yii.
I quit my job.	Mo fi iṣẹ mi silẹ.
All these things are told to us in person.	Gbogbo nkan wọnyi ni a sọ fun wa ni eniyan.
He thought he would get out of it.	O ro pe oun yoo yọ kuro ninu rẹ.
And if something can happen, that's fine.	Ati pe ti nkan ba le ṣẹlẹ, iyẹn dara.
They can sleep well at night.	Wọn le sun daradara ni alẹ.
The journey took several days.	Irin-ajo naa gba ọjọ diẹ pupọ.
Things will start to get hot, but it is not necessary yet.	Awọn nkan yoo bẹrẹ lati gbona, ṣugbọn kii ṣe pataki sibẹsibẹ.
I want to see my friends and laugh.	Mo fẹ lati ri awọn ọrẹ mi ati ki o rẹrin.
Wood for fire.	Igi fun ina.
That is a problem, but a good one.	Iyẹn jẹ iṣoro, ṣugbọn ọkan ti o dara.
Make sure you lock the door after you leave.	Rii daju pe o ti ilẹkun lẹhin ti o lọ.
The decision is over.	Ipinnu naa ti kọja.
I can make a move out of love.	Mo ti le ṣe kan Gbe jade ti ife.
Thus, high and high.	Bayi, ga ati giga.
Look first at the most obvious places.	Wo akọkọ ni awọn aaye ti o han julọ.
No car is moving.	Ko si ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan ti n gbe.
But we do not have time.	Sugbon a ko ti akoko.
And even some unnamed.	Ati paapaa diẹ ninu awọn ti ko ni orukọ.
The group welcomes new members.	Ẹgbẹ naa n gba awọn ọmọ ẹgbẹ tuntun.
It does not need to be.	Ko nilo lati jẹ.
There is harm.	Nibẹ ni ipalara.
And their eyes.	Ati awọn oju wọn.
You get what you expect.	O gba ohun ti o reti.
I have not seen or thought of it for many years.	Emi ko tii rii tabi ronu rẹ fun ọdun pupọ.
It was one of those years.	O jẹ ọkan ninu awọn ọdun yẹn.
Need it in me.	Nilo rẹ ninu mi.
Not too many people know.	Ko ju ọpọlọpọ awọn eniyan mọ.
Think about what you understand.	Ronu kini nipa rẹ ti o loye.
You need to pull yourself together.	O nilo lati fa ara rẹ papọ.
With big hands.	Pẹlu ọwọ nla.
He is the best dog ever.	Oun ni aja ti o dara julọ lailai.
Once upon a time.	Igba kan.
Spend the most time.	Lo akoko pupọ julọ.
You make questions.	O ṣe awọn ibeere.
I don’t know how you can help.	Emi ko mọ bi o ṣe le ṣe o le ṣe iranlọwọ.
You always feel like you are watching it.	O lero ni gbogbo igba pe o n wo rẹ.
More than a few times, he lost.	Ni diẹ sii ju awọn igba diẹ, o padanu.
If you want.	Ti o ba fẹ.
This person will not benefit.	Eniyan yii kii yoo ni anfani.
You just have to find yourself.	O kan ni lati wa ara rẹ.
They are also at work.	Wọn tun wa ni iṣẹ.
It should go down in the first week.	O yẹ ki o lọ silẹ ni ọsẹ akọkọ.
Please do not eat.	Jọwọ ma jẹun.
I'm on the way down.	Mo wa ni ọna isalẹ.
The baby is less than a year old.	Ọmọ naa ko to ọdun kan.
It took some.	O mu diẹ ninu awọn.
Here is what will happen.	Eyi ni ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
They went out.	Wọn jade lọ.
We usually go to the store for lunch.	Nigbagbogbo a lọ si ile itaja fun ounjẹ ọsan.
People also talk about the food.	Awọn eniyan tun sọrọ nipa ounjẹ naa.
Someone had to activate them.	Ẹnikan ni lati ti mu wọn ṣiṣẹ.
They plan before they work.	Wọn ṣe eto ṣaaju ki wọn to ṣiṣẹ.
And we treat ourselves as such.	Ati pe a tọju ara wa bi iru.
Any trouble, that is.	Eyikeyi wahala, iyẹn ni.
Or try to eat.	Tabi gbiyanju lati jẹ.
I read to music.	Mo ka si orin.
I want you to come out for the wedding.	Mo fe ki o wa jade fun igbeyawo.
He went for it.	O si lọ fun o.
The more times you finish them, the more rewards you can get.	Awọn diẹ igba ti o pari wọn, awọn le awọn ere gba.
He is very angry.	O binu pupọ.
I want you to know my friends.	Mo fẹ ki o mọ awọn ọrẹ mi.
Women do the same.	Awọn obinrin ma tun ṣe.
But of course.	Sugbon dajudaju.
You can walk well.	O le rin daradara.
Maybe it's fast.	Boya o n sare.
I am confident at this time.	Mo ni idaniloju ni akoko yii.
It requires a lot of resources.	O nilo ohun elo pupọ.
You can only use any part of that day.	O le lo eyikeyi ọjọ ti ọjọ yẹn nikan.
Let's go let's go.	Jẹ ká lọ jẹ ki a lọ.
You can get married with other children.	O le ṣe igbeyawo pẹlu awọn ọmọ miiran.
It looks like that now.	O dabi iyẹn ni bayi.
I found that it surprised me.	Mo ti ri wipe o ya ara mi.
I don't want to go back to that.	Emi ko fẹ lati pada si iyẹn.
I hate to think.	Mo korira lati ro.
Feeling that things will never get better.	Rilara pe awọn nkan kii yoo dara rara.
We can talk about that.	A le sọrọ nipa iyẹn.
Obviously we have more work to do.	O han ni pe a ni iṣẹ diẹ lati ṣe.
Will just get it.	Yoo kan gba.
Move things until they find a home on your site.	Gbe awọn nkan lọ titi ti wọn yoo fi rii ile ni aaye rẹ.
I will continue that way.	Emi yoo tẹsiwaju ni ọna yẹn.
You will not miss anything.	Iwọ kii yoo padanu ohunkohun.
But when they found the car, no one was found.	Ṣugbọn nigbati wọn wa ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ naa, ko si ọkan ti a ri.
He was no longer in that room, but back into his room.	Ko si ninu yara yẹn mọ, ṣugbọn pada sinu yara rẹ.
Of course, they have not restored his cause.	Dajudaju, wọn ko ti mu idi rẹ pada.
Almost talking at the point is already yours.	O fẹrẹ sọrọ ni aaye naa jẹ tirẹ tẹlẹ.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Ma binu pe o binu pupọ.
I would run around, and call out for him to play.	Emi yoo sare ni ayika, ki o si pe jade fun u lati mu ṣiṣẹ.
My wife is doing very well.	Iyawo mi n ṣe dara julọ.
It tested well.	O ṣe idanwo daradara.
With less interest, probably.	Pẹlu kere anfani, jasi.
You want to take it off.	O fẹ lati mu kuro.
Essentially, never do anything like this again.	Ni pataki, maṣe ṣe ohunkohun bii eyi lẹẹkansi.
He lost himself in it.	O padanu ara rẹ ninu rẹ.
Even this is where they go.	Paapaa eyi ni wọn lọ.
I shook my head.	Mo ju ori mi.
The woman did not want to get married.	Obinrin naa ko fẹ lati ṣe igbeyawo.
They did not come here to do so.	Wọn ko wa si ibi lati ṣe bẹ.
We are not talking anymore.	A ko sọrọ mọ.
The end will come soon.	Ipari yoo wa laipẹ.
He wrote me letters.	O kọ mi awọn lẹta.
He will tell you a little bit about it in a song.	Oun yoo sọ fun ọ diẹ nipa rẹ ninu orin kan.
It has reached you now.	O ti de ọdọ rẹ ni bayi.
Again he tried to want the world to change, and nothing happened.	Lẹẹkansi o gbiyanju lati fẹ aye lati yipada, ko si si ohun ti o ṣẹlẹ.
Get out of your hand.	Jade kuro ni ọwọ rẹ.
He could not say much about the story for obvious reasons.	Ko le sọ pupọ nipa itan naa fun awọn idi ti o han gbangba.
I have done a lot.	Mo ti ṣe pupọ julọ.
Many teachers use this technique to make the story more interesting.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn olukọ lo ọgbọn yii lati jẹ ki itan jẹ ki o dun diẹ sii.
Here’s a way you can help right now.	Eyi ni ọna kan ti o le ṣe iranlọwọ ni bayi.
I think maybe there was an accident or something.	Mo ro pe boya ijamba kan wa tabi nkankan.
I think he was talking to everyone.	Mo ro pe o n ba gbogbo eniyan sọrọ.
He wanted a passionate way to start a story.	O fẹ ọna ti o nifẹ lati bẹrẹ itan kan.
I can not read your comment.	Emi ko le ka ọrọ rẹ.
He loves art.	O nifẹ si aworan.
But it does not have to be.	Ṣugbọn o ko ni lati jẹ.
She’s helping him up.	O n ṣe iranlọwọ fun u soke.
The dog is happy.	Inu aja dun.
You don’t want to have a tree too high.	O ko fẹ lati ni igi ti o ga ju.
Okay, let them go.	O dara, jẹ ki wọn lọ.
That will not happen.	Iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ.
I wondered if my contract was one way or another.	Mo ro boya adehun mi jẹ ọna kan.
Now is the day.	Bayi ni ọjọ yẹn.
This time, he thought something for.	Ni akoko yi, o ro nkankan fun.
My classes are not as difficult as that of my teacher.	Awọn kilasi mi ko nira bi ti olukọ mi.
This can be a simple game.	Eyi le jẹ ere ti o rọrun.
Some people agree, some people don’t.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan gba, diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ko.
You may want to hurt him.	O le fẹ lati ṣe ipalara fun u.
At least, you can't show it.	O kere ju, o ko le fi han.
What is that?	Kini o jẹ pe?
I need to feel it.	Mo nilo lati lero rẹ.
He made a decision.	O ṣe ipinnu kan.
You know that’s your job here.	O mọ pe iyẹn ni iṣẹ rẹ nibi.
I would say this.	Emi yoo sọ eyi.
Or myself.	Tabi ara mi.
It's not too late yet.	Ko tii pẹ ju sibẹsibẹ.
I am not part of your family.	Emi kii ṣe ara idile rẹ.
I'm sure they are.	Mo daju pe wọn jẹ.
He had to drink, and he climbed up.	O ni ki o mu, o si gun oke.
You yourself can see and feel it.	Iwọ funrararẹ le rii ati rilara rẹ.
That would be great.	Iyẹn yoo dara gaan.
I slept a lot.	Mo sun pupo.
There are.	Nibẹ ni o wa.
From another.	Lati miiran.
This will be the big room.	Eyi yoo jẹ yara nla naa.
We are always happy to hear from you.	Inu wa dun nigbagbogbo lati gbọ lati ọdọ rẹ.
I cleaned our room.	Mo ti nu yara yara wa mọ.
He told me to go.	O ni ki n lọ gaan.
Not everyone needs legal services in time.	Ko gbogbo eniyan nilo awọn iṣẹ ofin ni akoko.
And they continue to grow, year after year.	Ati pe wọn tẹsiwaju lati dagba, ọdun lẹhin ọdun.
I'll start tomorrow.	Emi yoo bẹrẹ ni ọla.
And not just any book.	Ati ki o ko o kan eyikeyi iwe.
Return to life.	Pada si aye.
You will not hear or die.	Iwọ kii yoo gbọ tabi ku.
There is a seat in front.	Ijoko kan wa ni iwaju.
It's just your body, you know.	Ara rẹ nikan ni, o mọ.
That place has no name, either.	Ibi yẹn ko ni orukọ, boya.
Some good stuff came out this week.	Diẹ ninu awọn nkan ti o dara wa jade ni ọsẹ yii.
He reached for the book.	O de iwe naa.
These last few years have been very difficult.	Awọn ọdun diẹ sẹhin wọnyi ti nira pupọ.
Turn off the lights.	Pa awọn ina.
I enjoyed your meeting.	Mo gbadun ipade yin.
Find a friend to walk with.	Wa ọrẹ kan lati rin pẹlu.
I have seen many things.	Mo ti ri ọpọlọpọ nkan.
We return to where we started.	A pada si ibiti a ti bẹrẹ.
He left.	O lọ kuro.
We know, too.	Ti a mọ, ju.
Be the one to say sorry.	Jẹ awọn ọkan lati sọ binu.
This small town was once known for its train service.	Ilu kekere yii ni a mọ nigba kan fun iṣẹ ọkọ oju irin rẹ.
This site needs to be done.	Aaye yii nilo lati ṣe.
One day you may have understood, but not three.	Ni ọjọ kan o le ti loye, ṣugbọn kii ṣe mẹta.
I want you to do well in your life.	Mo fẹ ki o ṣe daradara ninu igbesi aye rẹ.
It will be helpful.	Yoo jẹ iranlọwọ.
It is a homemade lunch.	O jẹ ounjẹ ọsan ti ile.
I'm sure he would say the same thing.	Mo da mi loju pe oun yoo sọ ohun kan naa.
In everything in my life you will never have anything.	Ninu ohun gbogbo ninu aye mi ti o yoo ko si ohun to ni.
For others, it was last week.	Fun awọn miiran, o jẹ ọsẹ to kọja.
I want to get up and leave.	Mo fẹ lati dide ki o si lọ kuro.
Everyone wants it.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o fẹ.
But this is not where the idea came from.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe ibiti ero naa ti wa.
Do not believe everything you read in the newspapers.	Maṣe gbagbọ ohun gbogbo ti o ka ninu awọn iwe iroyin.
She felt disgusting from him.	O rilara ara korira lati ọdọ rẹ.
You need it, they have it.	O nilo rẹ, wọn ni.
I learned zero.	Mo kọ odo.
You like it or you don't like it.	Iwọ fẹran rẹ tabi korira rẹ.
I think we will be together forever.	Mo ro pe a yoo wa papọ lailai.
Determined to start again.	Ti pinnu lati bẹrẹ lẹẹkansi.
Very easy to do.	Rọrun pupọ lati ṣe.
I can feel in your voice.	Mo le lero ninu ohun rẹ.
Maybe better in bed, too.	Boya dara julọ ni ibusun, paapaa.
It will do.	Yoo ṣe.
Good for me.	O dara fun mi.
He did not receive anything.	Ko gba nkankan.
I come from working class.	Mo wa lati awọn ṣiṣẹ kilasi.
I haven't seen him since this afternoon.	Emi ko tii ri i lati ọsan yii.
No, he said a word.	Rara, o sọ ọrọ kan.
Most people still believe that such things are possible.	Ọpọlọpọ eniyan ṣi gbagbọ pe iru awọn nkan bẹẹ ṣee ṣe patapata.
He thought they were dead.	O ro pe wọn ti ku.
Every day goes by.	Gbogbo ọjọ lọ nipa.
He looks small.	O dabi ẹni kekere.
I remember I was in a wonderful place before that.	Mo ranti pe mo wa ni ibi iyanu ṣaaju iyẹn.
Nothing really.	Ko si nkankan ni otitọ.
We slept in our own arms.	A sun oorun ni ọwọ ara wa.
I have been working for two years.	Mo ti n ṣiṣẹ fun ọdun meji.
And that’s how it started.	Ati pe iyẹn ni bi o ṣe bẹrẹ.
He said he could not remember.	O ni oun ko le ranti.
So we took a break on the first day.	Nitorina a gba isinmi ni ọjọ akọkọ.
You can also hear the sounds of the past.	O tun le gbọ awọn ohun ti o ti kọja.
But, essentially, they are not open.	Ṣugbọn, ni pataki, wọn ko ṣii.
So write that down in your mind.	Nitorina kọ iyẹn si inu rẹ.
They know that other people take your position.	Wọn mọ pe awọn eniyan miiran gba ipo rẹ.
About the dog.	Nipa nkan aja.
For advice and materials.	Fun imọran ati awọn ohun elo.
It is an ancient city full of young people.	O jẹ ilu igba atijọ ti o kun fun awọn ọdọ.
He knew the weather was bad.	O mọ pe oju ojo ko dara.
Do not stop.	Ko da duro.
He touched her face.	O fi ọwọ kan oju rẹ.
She is a great mother.	Iya nla ni.
They know where the best moments are to have.	Wọn mọ ibi ti awọn akoko ti o dara julọ ni lati ni.
You can do whatever you want.	O le ṣe ohunkohun ti o fẹ.
You can drink.	O le mu.
Your home is a simple matter.	Ile rẹ jẹ ọrọ ti o rọrun.
That is the name you are interested in.	Iyẹn jẹ orukọ ti o nifẹ si.
He turned to his father.	O yipada si baba rẹ.
I do not need this.	Emi ko nilo eyi.
Note the deadlines.	Ṣe akiyesi awọn akoko ipari.
I can tell you a lot right now.	Mo le sọ fun ọ pupọ ni bayi.
I asked for his name.	Mo beere fun orukọ rẹ.
I could have sat there ever doing nothing.	Mo ti le ti joko nibẹ lailai ṣe ohunkohun.
I spent all my time with my mom and dad.	Mo lo gbogbo akoko pẹlu iya mi ati baba mi.
I will contact you soon.	Emi yoo kan si laipẹ.
You do not want to help my work.	O ko fẹ lati ran iṣẹ mi lọwọ.
Is there.	O wa nibẹ.
I think he left because he wanted to leave.	Mo ro pe o lọ nitori o fẹ lati lọ kuro.
But there is a new home that just looks old.	Ṣugbọn ile tuntun wa ti o dabi atijọ nikan.
But it was not the same.	Sugbon o je ko kanna.
These first two things are true.	Awọn nkan meji akọkọ wọnyi jẹ otitọ.
I let it go.	Mo jẹ ki o lọ.
I think your information is interesting.	Mo ro pe alaye rẹ dun.
There is no obvious reason.	Ko si idi ti o han gbangba.
They can't remember anything.	Wọn ko le ranti ohunkohun.
It's a hard place.	Ibi lile ni.
I can't think that is a good thing.	Nko le ro pe ohun to dara niyen.
What took you so long?	Kini o gba ọ pẹ to bẹ?
I have never thought of it.	Emi ko ti ronu rẹ rara.
You haven’t expected things.	O ti ko reti awọn ohun.
They work every day, every day.	Wọn ṣiṣẹ ni gbogbo ọjọ, ni gbogbo ọjọ.
I have never been around them and never had a good time.	Mo ti ko ti ni ayika wọn ati ki o ko ni kan ti o dara akoko.
Children and families visit this site.	Awọn ọmọde ati awọn idile ṣabẹwo si aaye yii.
Do not hurry.	Maṣe yara.
Some here, some in the city.	Diẹ ninu nibi, diẹ ninu ilu.
We are not in a position to give them jobs.	A ko wa ni ipo lati fun wọn ni awọn iṣẹ.
No man can.	Ko si eniyan le.
We depend on it here.	A da lori rẹ nibi.
How much do we love your work.	Elo ni a nifẹ iṣẹ rẹ.
It seems too late.	O dabi ipari ju.
It would mean that they have no control over anyone.	Yoo tumọ si pe wọn ko ni agbara lori ẹnikan.
Maybe if you talk a little.	Boya ti o ba sọrọ diẹ.
Nothing can be done at this point.	Ko si ohun ti a le ṣe ni aaye yii.
It has not changed.	Ko yipada.
I can not with you.	Emi ko le pẹlu rẹ.
which.	eyi ti.
I will not miss everything.	Emi kii yoo padanu ohun gbogbo.
They are very good all the time.	Wọn dara pupọ ni gbogbo igba.
Has happened to everyone.	Ti ṣẹlẹ si gbogbo eniyan.
I remember your love.	Mo ranti ifẹ rẹ.
A good friend is again a good old-fashioned trial and error.	Ọrẹ ti o dara julọ jẹ lẹẹkansi idanwo ati aṣiṣe atijọ ti o dara.
That much we know for sure.	Iyẹn pupọ ti a mọ daju.
Try to remember the things you are married to.	Gbiyanju lati ranti awọn nkan ti o ṣe igbeyawo fun.
What a place this is.	Kini ibi ti eyi jẹ.
Just call as you see.	Kan pe bi o ti rii.
This is a great deal.	Eyi jẹ nla nla kan.
I do not know where it is.	Emi ko mọ ibiti o wa.
No more questions until it is over.	Ko si awọn ibeere mọ titi ti o ba pari.
I will not buy this dress.	Emi kii yoo ra aṣọ yii.
Some people do not understand that.	Diẹ ninu awọn eniyan ko loye iyẹn.
But no more.	Ṣugbọn ko si mọ.
He loved the game.	O feran ere naa.
Essentially because he was there.	Ni pataki nitori o ti wa nibẹ.
You have been seeing it for a while.	O ti wa ri i fun igba diẹ.
The more you work, the more money.	Awọn diẹ ti o ṣiṣẹ, awọn diẹ owo.
She looks at her sleeping cat.	O n wo ologbo rẹ ti o sun.
I no longer have my own love.	Emi ko ni ifẹ ti ara mi mọ.
The city sits on a hill.	Ilu naa joko lori oke kan.
And a lot of things to talk about.	Ati ọpọlọpọ awọn nkan lati sọrọ nipa.
For the time being, however, he seems to be alive.	Fun akoko yii, sibẹsibẹ, o dabi pe o wa laaye.
In other words, forget about the facts.	Ni awọn ọrọ miiran, gbagbe nipa awọn otitọ.
They change the way you think.	Wọn yi ọna ti o ronu pada.
No children played outside.	Ko si ọmọ dun ni ita.
It would never have happened to me.	Kii yoo ti ṣẹlẹ si mi rara.
And yet, it is almost always with people.	Ati sibẹsibẹ, o fẹrẹ jẹ nigbagbogbo pẹlu awọn eniyan.
Within a month you may start to appear young.	Ni oṣu kan o le bẹrẹ lati han ni ọdọ.
The tests were repeated three times.	Awọn idanwo naa tun ṣe ni igba mẹta.
I am happy.	Inu mi dun.
You will see it happening.	Iwọ yoo rii pe o n ṣẹlẹ.
I think they do, you know.	Mo ro pe wọn ṣe, o mọ.
I could have read the whole book that day.	Mo ti le ka gbogbo iwe ni ọjọ yẹn.
Your friend opens the box.	Ọrẹ rẹ ṣi apoti naa.
He never knew a girl he lived with.	Ko tii mọ ọmọbirin kan ti o gbe pẹlu ẹnikan.
I do not receive anything.	Nko gba nkankan.
Neither of them believed.	Bẹni ninu wọn ko gbagbọ.
But that doesn't work anymore.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣiṣẹ mọ.
At least one person was killed.	O kere ju eniyan kan ti pa.
With his eyes.	Pẹlu oju rẹ.
You don’t get out there and stand around.	O ko jade nibẹ ki o si duro ni ayika.
You don’t get any more attention.	O ko gba akiyesi diẹ sii.
We have never been out of town.	A ko ti jade ni ilu rara.
Okay, let’s get to the top.	O dara, jẹ ki a gba lati oke.
All cars were stolen last year.	Gbogbo awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ni wọn ji ni ọdun to kọja.
Make our stories.	Ṣe awọn itan wa.
Maybe one of the first to do this.	Boya ọkan ninu awọn akọkọ lati ṣe eyi.
You just want to get out of everything.	O kan fẹ lati lọ kuro ninu ohun gbogbo.
It will help in the game.	Yoo ṣe iranlọwọ ninu ere naa.
I hope you know that.	Mo nireti pe o mọ iyẹn.
Lots of details.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn alaye.
If so, it's a good idea.	Ti o ba jẹ bẹ, o jẹ imọran ti o dara.
Remember to consider your situation.	Ranti lati ṣe akiyesi ipo rẹ.
He has a bag at his feet.	O ni apo kan ni ẹsẹ rẹ.
In the picture it may look good, but it is not.	Ninu aworan o le dara, ṣugbọn kii ṣe bẹ.
No one knows where he is.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ ibiti o wa.
The human body is not visible.	Ara eniyan ko han.
The sister always does.	Arabinrin naa nigbagbogbo ma jẹ bẹ.
This is something he did not do.	Eyi jẹ ohun ti ko ṣe.
I do not know why, but it is.	Emi ko mọ idi, ṣugbọn o jẹ.
I use my upper body to run.	Mo lo ara oke mi lati sare.
And, if nothing else, you have to love the name.	Ati pe, ti ko ba si nkan miiran, o ni lati nifẹ orukọ naa.
A store will open soon.	Ile itaja kan yoo ṣii laipẹ.
That it does not.	Pe ko ni.
Her mother is in her room.	Iya rẹ ti wa ninu yara rẹ.
What will be, will be.	Kini yoo jẹ, yoo jẹ.
You can decide for yourself in front of that.	O le ṣe ipinnu ara rẹ ni iwaju yẹn.
It would be the right thing to do.	Yoo jẹ ohun ti o tọ lati ṣe.
He will say what you think is true.	Oun yoo sọ ohun ti o ro pe o jẹ otitọ.
Your body, your rules.	Ara rẹ, awọn ofin rẹ.
I should have asked more questions.	Mo yẹ ki o ti beere awọn ibeere diẹ sii.
They do not belong to the same world anymore.	Wọn kii ṣe ti aye kanna mọ.
So you should call them, and convince them.	Nitorina o yẹ ki o pe wọn, ki o si da wọn loju.
I do not think it is wrong to do so.	Emi ko ro pe o ṣe aṣiṣe lati ṣe.
It would not be the same without them.	Kii yoo jẹ kanna laisi wọn.
They have a few more to play with.	Wọn ni diẹ miiran lati mu ṣiṣẹ pẹlu.
I heard too much, too fast.	Mo ti gbọ pupọ ju, yara ju.
The children are well cared for.	A tọju awọn ọmọde daradara.
I have asked many, many times.	Mo ti beere ọpọlọpọ, ọpọlọpọ igba.
We drank tea.	A mu tii.
And that’s before the game.	Ati pe iyẹn ṣaaju ere naa.
Find the real reason for doing the job.	Wa idi otitọ fun ṣiṣe iṣẹ naa.
Have you ever noticed that your hair has grown?	Njẹ o ti ṣe akiyesi pe irun rẹ ti dagba?
I had to make a final decision.	Mo ni lati ṣe ipinnu ikẹhin.
You think you know.	O ro pe o mọ.
Expect a report back.	Reti a Iroyin pada.
My story teacher will not allow phones in class.	Olukọ itan mi kii yoo gba awọn foonu laaye ni kilasi.
He gave me his name.	O fun mi ni orukọ rẹ.
If we can get them.	Ti a ba le gba wọn.
But what do we know.	Ṣugbọn kini a mọ.
So this kind of point can be noticed.	Nitorina iru aaye yii le ṣe akiyesi.
You will not need spaces.	Iwọ kii yoo nilo awọn aaye.
Didn't know anyone, hadn't been there, just went.	Ko mọ ẹnikẹni, ko ti wa nibẹ, o kan lọ.
You don’t always get what you want.	O ko nigbagbogbo gba ohun ti o fẹ.
Two ways to take.	Awọn ọna meji lati ya.
The dog did the same.	Aja ṣe kanna.
But it all seems to end well.	Ṣugbọn gbogbo rẹ dabi pe o pari daradara.

Large trucks must be used to lift trees.	A gbọdọ lo awọn ọkọ nla nla lati gbe awọn igi.
There is no other way.	Ko si ọna miiran.
He could not walk or talk.	Ko le rin tabi sọrọ.
If you have, you may not have gone.	Ti o ba ni, o le ko ti lọ.
It can of course work.	O le dajudaju ṣiṣẹ.
Okay, and we continue with our lives.	Dara, ati pe a tẹsiwaju pẹlu igbesi aye wa.
It comes down to two things at this point.	O wa si isalẹ si awọn nkan meji ni aaye yii.
We tried everything we could think of.	A gbiyanju ohun gbogbo ti a le ro.
A few people stood in the back of the room.	Awọn eniyan diẹ duro ni ẹhin yara naa.
The problem is, you are not.	Iṣoro naa ni, iwọ kii ṣe.
He has had his hand in many places over the years.	O ti ni ọwọ rẹ ni ọpọlọpọ awọn aaye ni awọn ọdun.
A way that allows you to do whatever you want it to do.	Ọna ti o le jẹ ki o ṣe ohunkohun ti o fẹ ki o ṣe.
I just can't wait.	Mi o kan ko le duro.
This is more than we can do.	Eyi ju ohun ti a le ṣe lọ.
That he was running scared.	Wipe o n sare bẹru.
Both are gone.	Awọn mejeeji ti lọ.
It was something for them.	O jẹ nkan fun wọn.
This did not surprise me at all.	Eyi ko ṣe ohun iyanu fun mi diẹ.
My name is written on it.	Orukọ mi ti kọ lori rẹ.
For more information, age of age.	Fun alaye diẹ sii, awọn ọdun ti ọjọ ori.
One makes them like one who makes musical instruments.	Ọkan ṣe wọn bi ẹni ti o ṣe ohun elo orin.
They become friends for life.	Wọn di ọrẹ fun igbesi aye.
I get at least to a ball.	Mo gba o kere ju lọ si bọọlu kan.
That way, no one will see you.	Ni ọna yẹn, ko si ẹnikan ti yoo rii ọ.
I am looking around for this.	Mo n wa ni ayika fun eyi.
He stood nearby.	O duro nitosi.
He didn’t let her be a little kid.	Ko jẹ ki o jẹ ọmọ kekere kan.
He stays with me.	O duro pẹlu mi.
It's just fine.	O kan dara.
This did not go well either.	Eyi ko lọ daradara paapaa.
But he was right all the time.	Ṣugbọn o ti tọ ni gbogbo igba.
If you want one, buy it yourself.	Ti o ba fẹ ọkan, ra funrararẹ.
This is not a good job.	Eyi kii ṣe iṣẹ to dara.
You can not move.	O ko le gbe.
He stood there.	O duro nibẹ.
Work kills you.	Iṣẹ n pa ọ.
Please someone can do that.	Jọwọ ẹnikan le ṣe iyẹn.
Men or women.	Awọn ọkunrin tabi awọn obinrin.
Other than yourself.	Miiran ju ara rẹ.
No one was there for them.	Ko si ọkan nibẹ fun wọn.
How wonderful it is to be yourself again.	Bawo ni o ṣe jẹ iyalẹnu lati jẹ ararẹ lẹẹkansi.
I will not give up.	Emi ko ni gba.
That, even more so.	Iyẹn, paapaa diẹ sii.
This time it was by a man.	Ni akoko yii o jẹ nipasẹ ọkunrin kan.
Please, man.	Jọwọ, ọkunrin.
You want something to grow me.	O fẹ nkankan dagba mi.
Your work must have taught you that no one is perfect.	Iṣẹ rẹ gbọdọ ti kọ ọ pe ko si ẹnikan ti o pe.
This area is known for its wording.	A mọ agbegbe yii fun ọrọ rẹ.
We need to improve.	A nilo lati mu dara.
We looked at each other, but we said nothing.	A wo ara wa, ṣugbọn a ko sọ ohunkohun.
But he did not go.	Ṣugbọn ko lọ.
It is a machine.	Ẹrọ kan ni.
That’s not the only idea, however.	Iyẹn kii ṣe ero nikan, sibẹsibẹ.
They are a public interest.	Wọn jẹ anfani gbangba gbangba.
I had to find a new job.	Mo ni lati wa iṣẹ tuntun kan.
That makes it even sweeter.	Iyẹn jẹ ki o dun paapaa.
He became an old friend at the time.	O di ọrẹ atijọ ni akoko.
You have.	O ni .
Let's talk, let it happen.	Jẹ ki a sọrọ, jẹ ki o ṣẹlẹ.
Get up and speak out !.	Dide ki o sọ jade!.
I really do.	Mo ṣe gaan.
It was as well.	O je bi daradara.
Can't find it.	Ko le ri.
I have space to buy.	Mo ni aye lati ra.
He did a very good job after that.	O ṣe iṣẹ ti o dara pupọ lẹhin iyẹn.
They will eat well.	Wọn yoo jẹun daradara.
He did, for a moment.	O ṣe, fun akoko kan.
There are two ways you can get started.	Awọn ọna meji lo wa ti o le bẹrẹ.
People are also talking about that now.	Awọn eniyan tun sọrọ nipa iyẹn ni bayi.
At first we didn't think anything about it.	Ni akọkọ a ko ronu ohunkohun nipa rẹ.
What is the reason.	Kini idi ti o jẹ.
You know this and have no power to change.	O mọ eyi ko si ni agbara lati yi pada.
You will know the way.	Iwọ yoo mọ ọna naa.
Weeks later there was another.	Awọn ọsẹ lẹhin nibẹ wà miiran.
He got no and left me.	O ni rara o si kọ mi silẹ.
At first, he could not see anything.	Ni akọkọ, ko le ri nkankan.
Even as the weather was on the day they were born.	Paapaa bi oju ojo ti ri ni ọjọ ti a bi wọn.
There is a lot of information out there.	Alaye pupọ wa nibẹ.
We have that idea.	A ni ero yẹn.
They live inside.	Wọn n gbe inu.
I'm happy.	Inu mi dun.
But, of course, he did not say such a thing.	Ṣugbọn, dajudaju, ko sọ iru nkan bẹẹ.
I went out and there.	Mo jade ati nibẹ.
I turned around and closed my eyes.	Mo yipada, mo si pa oju mi ​​mọ.
Made from their clothes.	Awọn ti a ṣe lati wọn aṣọ.
You need two simple things.	O nilo awọn nkan ti o rọrun meji.
They worked for him and talked to him.	Wọn ṣiṣẹ fun u ati sọrọ si i.
Our eyes cannot see for a man outside the family.	Oju wa ko le ri fun ọkunrin kan ti ita idile.
You can not go down by the river.	O ko le lọ si isalẹ nipasẹ odo.
Note that it is important that.	Ṣe akiyesi pe o ṣe pataki pe.
But it can, very hard.	Sugbon o le, gan lile.
But over time, they grow up to be great friends.	Ṣugbọn lẹhin akoko, wọn dagba lati jẹ ọrẹ nla.
I turned to the next year.	Mo yipada si ọdun to wa.
Not sure if it works.	Ko daju boya o ṣiṣẹ.
There is a plane on top.	Ọkọ ofurufu kan wa lori oke.
All about dogs.	Gbogbo nipa aja.
I did not, of course, tell the whole story to him.	Emi ko, dajudaju, ko sọ gbogbo itan fun u.
All of this made him who he is today.	Gbogbo eyi ti sọ ọ di ẹni ti o jẹ loni.
A man can help but is unsure.	Ọkunrin kan le ṣe iranlọwọ ṣugbọn ko ni idaniloju.
His words are true.	Ọrọ rẹ jẹ otitọ.
The voyage entered the river after reaching the sea.	Irin-ajo naa wọ inu odo lẹhin ti o de okun.
We accept that this is a mistake.	A gba pe eyi jẹ aṣiṣe.
That should be sufficient enough.	Iyẹn ti to.
I asked her if she liked my husband.	Mo beere lọwọ rẹ boya o fẹran mi ọkọ.
This trip has captured everyone's imagination.	Irin-ajo yii ti gba oju inu gbogbo eniyan.
What good ?.	Ohun ti o dara?.
For women, it is a drink.	Fun awọn obinrin, o jẹ mimu kan.
The girls didn’t like being hit on.	Awọn ọmọbirin ko fẹran a lu lori.
There are many reasons why they are there.	Awọn idi pupọ lo wa ti wọn fi wa nibẹ.
So we went into my car.	Nitorina a lọ sinu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ mi.
It was a business decision.	O je kan owo ipinnu.
Or a lot of anything else has changed.	Tabi pupọ ti ohunkohun miiran ti yipada.
I do not remember their names.	Emi ko ranti awọn orukọ wọn.
Most of them were purchased, others came with gifts.	Ọpọlọpọ ninu wọn ni wọn ra, awọn miiran wa pẹlu ẹbun.
I have never heard a woman talk this way.	Emi ko tii gbọ obinrin kan sọrọ ni ọna yii.
Doing so will help the environment.	Ṣiṣe bẹ yoo ṣe iranlọwọ fun ayika.
He will do anything.	Oun yoo ṣe ohunkohun.
But those words are nothing new to me.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọrọ naa kii ṣe nkan tuntun si mi.
He quickly looked at it.	O yara wo o.
The right thing to do.	Ohun to tọ ni.
But it is also beautiful.	Ṣugbọn o tun lẹwa.
This will not go away.	Eyi kii yoo lọ kuro.
Children do not need to go to school.	Awọn ọmọde ko nilo lati lọ si ile-iwe.
Your body is now.	Ara ara re wa bayi.
Most doctors work long days a week.	Pupọ julọ awọn dokita ṣiṣẹ awọn ọjọ pipẹ ni ọsẹ kan.
If something doesn’t happen tomorrow morning, you have to sell.	Ti nkan ko ba ṣẹlẹ ni owurọ ọla, o ni lati ta.
He will not make a decision.	Ko ni ṣe ipinnu.
That amount is correct.	Iye yẹn tọ.
Maybe more than a year.	Boya o ju ọdun kan lọ.
I want to see the pictures if you use them !.	Mo fẹ lati wo awọn aworan ti o ba lo wọn!.
, they won.	, wọn gba.
Who is new?	Tani tuntun.
The important thing now is to find out who he is.	Ohun pataki ni bayi ni lati wa ẹni ti o jẹ.
I love it all, love it.	Mo nifẹ gbogbo rẹ, nifẹ rẹ.
My mother and father.	Iya mi ati baba mi.
Not on the phone.	Ko lori foonu.
Never again, never plan to do it again.	Ko ṣe lẹẹkansi, ko gbero lati tun ṣe lẹẹkansi.
But this does not count.	Ṣugbọn eyi ko ka.
We can't stay here.	A ko le duro nibi.
We don’t want trouble.	A ko fẹ wahala.
Or it may not be.	Tabi ko le si.
You are worth more than anything.	Ti o ba wa tọ diẹ sii ju ohunkohun.
And they are fast, too.	Ati pe wọn yara, paapaa.
If you want love, give love.	Ti o ba fẹ ifẹ, fun ifẹ.
Do what you want.	Ṣe ohun ti o fẹ.
Every day after work.	Ni gbogbo ọjọ lẹhin iṣẹ.
They did something.	Wọn ṣe ohun kan.
We took anything that was important off.	A mu ohunkohun ti o jẹ pataki pa.
It needs to be.	O nilo lati jẹ.
It will be possible.	Yoo ṣee ṣe.
He has a big hand.	O ni ọwọ nla.
Your room is upstairs.	Yara rẹ wa ni ipari.
This is the most important point.	Eyi ni aaye pataki julọ.
After a few minutes he looked up.	Lẹhin iṣẹju diẹ o wo soke.
They never expected it.	Wọn ko nireti rẹ rara.
From another place.	Lati ibi miiran.
Maybe the same as everything else here.	Boya kanna bi ohun gbogbo miiran nibi.
We were going to do it.	A ni won lilọ lati se o.
You need to leave.	O nilo lati lọ kuro.
It is impossible to say where the object is coming from.	Ko ṣee ṣe lati sọ ibiti ohun naa ti n bọ.
No one said a word.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o sọ ọrọ kan.
It's sweet and warm.	O dun ati ki o gbona.
But we have nothing to do with it, of course.	Ṣugbọn a ko ni nkankan lati ṣe pẹlu rẹ, dajudaju.
He was a great person to work for.	O jẹ eniyan nla lati ṣiṣẹ fun.
You may have been out of the house.	O le ti jade ni ile.
The group arrived early.	Ẹgbẹ naa de ni kutukutu.
We love you.	A feran re.
So why are you angry about that.	Nitorina kilode ti o fi n binu nipa iyẹn.
Tell me what you see or what you do not see.	Sọ fun mi ohun ti o ri tabi ohun ti o ko ri.
Tell him to stop	Sọ fun u lati da
Of course not.	Dajudaju ko da a loju.
He was eating his face.	O ti njẹ oju rẹ.
For the wicked.	Fun eniyan buburu.
It can help, though.	O le ṣe iranlọwọ, paapaa.
One of the most beautiful places in the world.	Ọkan ninu awọn julọ lẹwa ibi ninu aye.
I would be happy if they put it out.	Emi yoo dun ti wọn ba gbe e jade.
It was a place of business.	O je kan ibi ti owo.
I think that is enough.	Mo ro pe iyẹn ti to.
Or maybe you just wrote them down by someone with that name.	Tabi boya o kan kọ wọn nipasẹ eniyan kan ti o ni orukọ yẹn.
I'll see you in two days.	Emi yoo ri e ni ọjọ meji.
He and some of his friends.	Oun ati diẹ ninu awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
I want to play a game.	Mo fẹ ṣe ere kan.
Some sculptures are taken from wood.	Diẹ ninu awọn ere ni a ya lati igi.
We have to stay in the work we hate.	A ni lati duro ni iṣẹ ti a korira.
I don't see it happening yet.	Emi ko rii pe o ṣẹlẹ sibẹsibẹ.
But for a moment, he let go.	Ṣugbọn fun akoko kan yii, o jẹ ki o lọ.
We have a lot of time.	A ni akoko pupọ.
It is not a theory.	O ti wa ni ko kan yii.
He was young, not very old, and not very intelligent.	O jẹ ọdọ, ko dagba, ko si loye pupọ.
Back after that.	Pada lẹhin eyi.
Make up a few.	Ṣe soke kan diẹ.
I remember words and names and people.	Mo ranti awọn ọrọ ati awọn orukọ ati awọn eniyan.
See people.	Ri eniyan.
Now you must begin to believe.	Bayi o gbọdọ bẹrẹ lati gbagbọ.
You have got everything you ever wanted.	O ti gba ohun gbogbo ti o fẹ lailai.
You learn as a thing.	O kọ ẹkọ bi ohun kan.
We know how to deal with that.	A mọ bi a ṣe le ṣe pẹlu iyẹn.
It is about how you see your life.	O jẹ nipa bi o ṣe rii igbesi aye rẹ.
They are very good.	Wọn dara pupọ.
It has something.	O ni nkankan.
This is the simple truth of the matter.	Eyi jẹ otitọ ti o rọrun ti ọrọ naa.
He will draw more.	Oun yoo fa diẹ sii.
I could stay there forever.	Mo ti le duro nibẹ lailai.
And that works.	Ati pe iyẹn ṣiṣẹ.
I hope you all like it.	Mo nireti pe gbogbo yin fẹran rẹ.
We can not know what will happen.	A ko le mọ ohun ti yoo ṣẹlẹ.
Or, well, they deserve to be.	Tabi, daradara, wọn yẹ lati jẹ.
It takes about three months.	O gba to bii oṣu mẹta.
You have said so.	O ti sọ bẹ.
You better go, he said.	O dara ki o lọ, o sọ.
He was young, very new to any capacity.	O jẹ ọdọ, o jẹ tuntun pupọ lati ni agbara eyikeyi.
I can understand why that would happen.	Mo le loye idi ti iyẹn yoo ṣẹlẹ.
I think you know better than that.	Mo ro pe o mọ pe o dara ju iyẹn lọ.
That can happen, you know.	Iyẹn le ṣẹlẹ, o mọ.
I will not give you enough information.	Emi ko fun ọ ni alaye to.
From time immemorial, in other words.	Lati igba atijọ, ni awọn ọrọ miiran.
There is no question of such a thing here.	Ko si ibeere ti iru nkan nibi.
Do not miss a meal!	Maṣe padanu ounjẹ!
He will not let you go.	Oun yoo ko jẹ ki o lọ.
I only know the man.	Mo mọ ọkunrin naa nikan.
You can only move.	O le nikan gbe.
Nothing and no one ever stays the same.	Ko si ohun ko si si ọkan lailai duro kanna.
But she loves it, physically.	Ṣugbọn o fẹran rẹ, nipa ti ara.
And the rules are about making room for other people.	Ati awọn ofin jẹ nipa ṣiṣe yara fun awọn eniyan miiran.
This is your job.	Eyi ni iṣẹ rẹ.
This sounds good.	Eleyi dun ti o dara.
Two groups are known.	Awọn ẹgbẹ meji ni a mọ.
The gardens are beautiful.	Awọn ọgba jẹ lẹwa.
I took something.	Mo mu nkankan.
You will not because their city is even now.	Iwọ kii yoo nitori pe ilu wọn paapaa ni bayi.
Such a gift would not be.	Iru ẹbun bẹẹ kii yoo ṣe.
In your mind, talk to her.	Ninu ọkan rẹ, sọrọ si rẹ.
Your problems have taken over.	Awọn iṣoro rẹ ti gba ara rẹ lọwọ.
He took it twice.	O mu ni igba meji.
You will not let it be.	Iwọ kii yoo jẹ ki o jẹ.
But in some ways, it’s better.	Ṣugbọn ni diẹ ninu awọn ọna, o dara julọ.
She wore this dress every day of the week.	O wọ aṣọ yii ni gbogbo ọjọ ti ọsẹ.
You will not.	Iwọ kii yoo ṣe.
In a minute it will touch you.	Ni iṣẹju kan yoo fi ọwọ kan rẹ.
No one left the party until the next morning.	Ẹnikan ko kuro ni ayẹyẹ titi owurọ.
Just read the article.	Kan ka nkan naa.
A world of things.	A aye ti ohun.
With water, however, the situation is much less.	Pẹlu omi, sibẹsibẹ, ipo naa kere pupọ.
Please take them out of sight.	Jọwọ mu wọn kuro ni oju.
Everyone just continues to enjoy it.	Gbogbo eniyan kan tẹsiwaju lati gbadun.
Of course, all of these things matter.	Dajudaju, gbogbo nkan wọnyi ṣe pataki.
Take your seat in front of the room.	Gba ijoko rẹ ni iwaju yara naa.
She decided to take her picture.	O pinnu lati gba aworan rẹ.
It is full of words.	O kun fun ọrọ.
It has been abandoned.	O ti fi silẹ.

All the way through.	Gbogbo awọn ọna nipasẹ.
I’m not saying we will.	Emi ko sọ pe a yoo.
But you do not need to play.	Ṣugbọn o ko nilo lati mu ṣiṣẹ.
What do you stand for ?.	Kini o duro fun?.
It will not be beautiful.	Kii yoo lẹwa.
I did the same.	Mo tun ṣe kanna.
You just have to wait for them to move out.	O kan ni lati duro fun wọn lati gbe jade.
I would be, even.	Emi yoo jẹ, paapaa.
The phone is ringing.	Foonu naa tun n dun.
That they are also a family.	Pe wọn tun jẹ idile kan.
They are all gone!	Gbogbo wọn ti lọ!
This is what we tried in this book.	Eyi ni ohun ti a gbiyanju ninu iwe yii.
For what my opinion is right.	Fun ohun ti ero mi tọ.
Are you with us ?.	Ṣe o wa pẹlu wa?.
Stop and look !.	Duro ati wo!.
You do not have to feel anything.	O ko ni lati lero ohunkohun.
Something like a picture on the money.	Nkankan bi aworan lori owo.
You must have read the entire law book.	O gbọdọ ti ka gbogbo iwe ofin.
No, that is not the case.	Rara, nkan niyen.
Nothing.	Ko si nkan kan.
I do so much.	Mo ṣe bẹ pupọ.
You have not done anything yet.	O ko tii ṣe nkan kan.
At least not when they were young.	O kere kii ṣe nigbati wọn jẹ ọdọ.
Switch and accept all requests.	Yipada ki o gba gbogbo awọn ibeere.
I will keep my problems in and I do not say a word.	Emi yoo pa awọn iṣoro mi mọ ninu ati pe Emi ko sọ ọrọ kan.
It is possible that your work may exceed a lot of people.	O ṣee ṣe pe iṣẹ rẹ le ju ọpọlọpọ eniyan lọ.
I know it tastes good.	Mo mọ pe o dun.
He’s doing a job in it.	O n ṣe iṣẹ kan ninu rẹ.
Happy, good, be yourself !.	Inu dun, dara, jẹ ara rẹ!.
Over the years, they have all grown so much.	Ni awọn ọdun, gbogbo wọn ti dagba pupọ.
You want it to work on your own.	O fẹ ki o ṣiṣẹ funrararẹ.
I do not want to change the value.	Emi ko fẹ yi iye pada.
Insightful eyes.	Oju ti o loye.
And, if you need a good reason, this is it.	Ati pe, ti o ba nilo idi to dara, eyi ni.
At least two of them must be present.	O kere ju meji ninu wọn gbọdọ wa.
This book just caught me.	Iwe yi kan mu mi.
The program is easy to understand.	Eto naa rọrun lati ni oye.
He let us eat.	O jẹ ki a jẹ.
It's over.	O ti pari.
But you can not.	Sugbon o ko le.
Can't help myself.	Ko le ran ara mi lọwọ.
He is friendly and understanding with someone.	O jẹ ọrẹ ati oye pẹlu ẹnikan.
But maybe don’t like him.	Ṣugbọn boya ma ṣe fẹ fun u.
I have nothing in my life.	Nko ni nkankan ninu aye mi.
Everything changed but some things remained the same.	Ohun gbogbo yipada ṣugbọn diẹ ninu awọn nkan duro kanna.
You should not see that we are here.	Ko yẹ ki o rii pe a wa nibi.
I need to leave.	Mo nilo lati lọ kuro.
It just makes sense to me.	O kan jẹ oye fun mi.
We totally accept that.	A gba iyẹn patapata.
I do not know why, but we do.	Emi ko mọ idi, ṣugbọn a ṣe.
A new restaurant opens in town.	Ile ounjẹ tuntun kan ṣii ni ilu.
It could be my book method.	O le jẹ ọna iwe mi.
I don’t have to be good to handle bad people.	Emi ko ni lati dara lati mu awọn eniyan buburu.
Who stole it did not ask for.	Ti o ji o ko beere fun.
He left the house and walked to the port.	O kuro ni ile o si rin si ibudo.
Without more important information, this is the best thing we can do.	Laisi alaye pataki diẹ sii, eyi ni ohun ti o dara julọ ti a le ṣe.
To give them the ability to be better.	Lati fun wọn ni agbara lati dara julọ.
Of course we will tell everyone that you are with me.	Dajudaju a yoo sọ fun gbogbo eniyan pe o wa pẹlu mi.
These ideas turn fire into fire.	Awọn ero wọnyi yipada ina si ina.
So make the best of them.	Nitorina ṣe awọn ti o dara julọ ninu wọn.
And that's what we were there for.	Ati awọn ti o ni ohun ti a wà nibẹ fun.
What am I?	Kini emi.
He saw what it was.	O si ri ohun ti o jẹ.
This is your problem.	Eyi ni iṣoro rẹ.
My father read it to me from a history book.	Baba mi ka fun mi lati inu iwe itan.
I love everything about it.	Mo nifẹ ohun gbogbo nipa rẹ.
Do not try to understand.	Maṣe gbiyanju lati ni oye.
So nothing else.	Nitorina ko si nkan miiran.
Whatever is true is the reality of the present moment.	Ohunkohun ti o jẹ otitọ jẹ otitọ ti akoko bayi.
The trees around this house.	Awọn igi ni ayika ile yii.
She is worried that she will never see her child again.	O ni aniyan pe oun ko ni ri ọmọ rẹ mọ.
Some must come.	Diẹ ninu gbọdọ wa.
Soon no one could tell him what he did not know.	Laipẹ ko si ẹnikan ti o le sọ ohun ti ko mọ fun u.
Well, well, well.	Daradara, daradara, daradara.
I do not live.	Emi ko gbe.
We do not perform our duties.	A ko ṣe awọn iṣẹ wa.
You have to stay here with us.	O ni lati duro nibi pẹlu wa.
And it gives them strength.	Ati pe o fun wọn ni agbara.
Three boats were taken off the water.	Awọn ọkọ oju omi mẹta ti ya kuro ninu omi.
There are many of them at this time.	Ọpọlọpọ wọn wa ni akoko yii.
You buy clothes in the store.	O ra awọn aṣọ ni ile itaja.
You will be beaten.	A yoo lu ọ.
Even now, his eyes are on me.	Paapaa ni bayi, oju rẹ wa lori mi.
I am returning home.	Mo n pada si ile.
Children have nothing, nothing.	Awọn ọmọ ko ni nkankan, nkankan.
The bus ride takes about an hour.	Irin-ajo ọkọ akero gba to bii wakati kan.
They could not believe their eyes.	Wọn ko le gbagbọ oju wọn.
They have said for years what you need to do.	Wọn ti sọ fun ọdun ohun ti o nilo lati ṣe.
I do not understand why you want to do this.	Emi ko loye idi ti o fẹ ṣe eyi.
Everything looks like pictures.	Ohun gbogbo dabi awọn aworan.
I would say to myself that.	Emi yoo sọ fun ara mi pe.
Let’s talk about this at breakfast.	Jẹ ki a sọrọ nipa eyi ni ounjẹ owurọ.
This is not like any other place.	Eyi ko dabi ibi miiran.
Roads in the area are even worse.	Awọn ọna ni agbegbe jẹ paapaa buburu.
I want information now.	Mo fẹ alaye ni bayi.
We cannot be left like this.	A ko le fi silẹ bi eleyi.
You know this to be true.	O mọ eyi lati jẹ otitọ.
I can't do anything about it.	Nko le se nkankan nipa re.
And letter stories grow and grow.	Ati awọn itan lẹta dagba ati dagba.
It works really well.	O ṣiṣẹ daradara daradara.
He has no money either.	Ko si ni owo boya.
It looks too young.	O wo ju odo.
It was all we needed.	O je gbogbo awọn ti a ti nilo.
The right way to be.	Ọna ti o yẹ lati jẹ.
The house was almost too hot, but it was sweet.	Ile naa fẹrẹ gbona pupọ, ṣugbọn o dun.
They are easy and fast to make.	Wọn rọrun ati yara lati ṣe.
You can see the settings below.	O le wo awọn eto ni isalẹ.
Best wishes on your exam.	Awọn ifẹ ti o dara julọ lori idanwo rẹ.
And with him when he went.	Ati pẹlu rẹ nigbati o lọ.
If you want to go, you have to go.	Ti o ba fẹ lọ, o ni lati lọ.
You know the name.	O mọ orukọ naa.
It helps to test if the same thing happens all the time.	O ṣe iranlọwọ lati ṣe idanwo ti o ba ṣẹlẹ kanna ni gbogbo igba.
For us this is true in two ways.	Fun wa eyi jẹ otitọ ni awọn ọna meji.
No one was there to meet him.	Ko si ẹnikan ti o wa nibẹ lati pade rẹ.
Add the tea.	Fi tii naa kun.
You can remember it.	O le ranti rẹ.
I love this room.	Mo nifẹ yara yii.
It is found on the field.	O ri lori aaye.
Leave for a day.	Fi silẹ fun ọjọ kan.
He came back.	O wa pada.
This used to work well.	Eyi lo lati ṣiṣẹ daradara.
However, that only includes the same picture.	Sibẹsibẹ, iyẹn nikan pẹlu aworan kanna.
You can't think of that.	O ko le ronu iyẹn.
Maybe, he has nothing to worry about.	Boya, ko ni nkankan lati ṣe aniyan nipa.
Find the.	Wa awọn.
His mother is also married.	Iya re tun iyawo.
Her mother is anxious.	Iya rẹ ni aniyan.
Maybe it's as simple as that.	Boya o rọrun bi iyẹn.
I usually pay people to do that for me.	Mo maa n san owo fun awọn eniyan lati ṣe nkan yẹn fun mi.
We do not know who they are.	A ko mọ awọn ti wọn jẹ.
His eyes are on his watch.	Oju rẹ wa lori aago rẹ.
You need good shoes.	O nilo bata to dara.
Find the previous text.	Wa ọrọ ti tẹlẹ.
He thought and thought.	O ro o si ro.
That word is dead.	Ọrọ yẹn ti o ku.
This woman does not need it.	Obinrin yii ko nilo rẹ.
He knew he should tell her everything.	O mọ pe o yẹ ki o sọ ohun gbogbo fun u.
He has given her a job that is not worth it.	O ti fun u ni iṣẹ ti ko ni anfani.
She worries that you will kill her or take her.	O ni aniyan pe iwọ yoo pa oun tabi ki o mu u.
I have written a lot of the program.	Mo ti kọ pupọ julọ ti eto naa.
That will pass.	Iyẹn yoo kọja.
But most of all he was my best friend.	Ṣugbọn pupọ julọ o jẹ ọrẹ mi to dara julọ.
You do not see what you want to see.	O ko ri awọn ohun ti o fẹ lati ri.
I just love to walk through buildings.	Mo kan nifẹ lati rin nipasẹ awọn ile.
That may be good enough for your purposes.	Iyẹn le dara to fun awọn idi rẹ.
You are young now and it is high time you decided these things.	O jẹ ọdọ ni bayi ati pe o to akoko ti o pinnu nkan wọnyi.
I was tired after a long time in this profession.	O rẹ mi lẹhin igba pipẹ ninu iṣẹ yii.
You may not remember the name of the item.	O le ma ranti orukọ nkan naa.
It was written.	A kọ ọ.
You have your space.	O ni aaye rẹ.
I never thought about it.	Emi ko ronu nipa rẹ rara.
I told him not to ask any more.	Mo ti so fun u ko beere eyikeyi mọ.
It may be the last mistake you make.	O le jẹ aṣiṣe ikẹhin ti o ṣe.
But now, it has become.	Ṣugbọn ni bayi, o ti di.
We will not go down.	A ko ni lọ silẹ.
Easy to do.	Rọrun lati ṣe.
You know what your job is.	O mọ kini iṣẹ rẹ jẹ.
They know how to make their own kind of music.	Wọn mọ bi a ṣe le ṣe iru orin ti ara wọn.
Thirty one, even.	Ọgbọn ọkan, paapaa.
He knew that was wrong but could not help himself.	O mọ pe iyẹn ko tọ ṣugbọn ko le ran ararẹ lọwọ.
They let it go.	Wọn jẹ ki o lọ.
Day after day is over.	Ọjọ lẹhin ọjọ ti kọja.
I hope it is not me.	Mo nireti pe kii ṣe emi.
We are all having wonderful years.	Gbogbo wa ni awọn ọdun ti o dara julọ.
It was done in a minute.	O ti ṣe ni iṣẹju kan.
No one knows their value.	Ko si ẹniti o mọ iye wọn.
Going up to you.	Ti lọ soke si ọdọ rẹ.
This woman is from the top of the road.	Obinrin yii wa lati oke opopona.
I really love my daughter but this is not about love.	Mo nifẹ ọmọbirin mi gaan ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe nipa ifẹ.
The word used for this is an advantage.	Ọrọ ti a lo fun eyi jẹ anfani.
They have not gone public about it.	Wọn ko ti lọ ni gbangba nipa rẹ.
It's too late for school, do you?	O pẹ diẹ fun ile-iwe, ṣe iwọ?
Location has a lot to do with people.	Ipo ibi ni ọpọlọpọ lati ṣe pẹlu eniyan.
Don't let them stare at you!	Maṣe jẹ ki wọn gbe oju rẹ si!
Some died, some moved.	Diẹ ninu awọn ti ku, diẹ ninu awọn gbe.
That will never happen, it will never happen today.	Iyẹn kii yoo ṣẹlẹ, lailai ṣẹlẹ loni.
He never let me talk to him.	O ko jẹ ki n ba a sọrọ.
Do you know where this is?	Ṣe o mọ ibiti eyi wa?
For me it is.	Fun mi o jẹ.
One more thing to keep in mind.	Ohun kan diẹ sii lati tọju pẹlu.
We are all one.	Gbogbo wa ni ọkan.
Fast as they are.	O yara bi wọn ṣe jẹ.
He walked down the street.	O rin si isalẹ awọn ita.
They have done it again this year.	Wọn ti tun ṣe ni ọdun yii.
We should probably think that out.	A yẹ ki o jasi ro pe jade.
He had gone for the day while he was outside back.	O ti lọ fun ọjọ naa nigba ti o wa ni ita pada.
The company is always thinking of new ways to bring people together.	Ile-iṣẹ nigbagbogbo n ronu awọn ọna tuntun lati mu awọn eniyan papọ.
But that doesn’t do any good, either.	Ṣugbọn iyẹn ko ṣe eyikeyi ti o dara, boya.
Just happy for you to say it again and again.	O kan dun si ọ lati sọ lẹẹkansi ati lẹẹkansi.
You do not want to keep it.	O ko fẹ lati tọju rẹ.
Nothing can be done without it.	Ko si ohun ti o le ṣee ṣe laisi rẹ.
You’re right, like that always happens.	O tọ, bii iyẹn nigbagbogbo ṣẹlẹ.
You do not need to lock the door.	O ko nilo lati ti ilẹkun.
If they are, we can find where we are.	Ti wọn ba wa, a le wa ibi ti a wa.
They do not understand their human ways.	Wọn ko loye awọn ọna eniyan wọn.
You forgot to turn off the device.	O gbagbe lati pa ẹrọ naa.
I want to eat something.	Mo fẹ lati jẹ nkankan.
The eyes of all of you.	Oju ti gbogbo yin.
Now nothing was as it should have been.	Bayi ko si ohun ti o wà bi o ti yẹ ki o jẹ.
Books are always important.	Awọn iwe jẹ pataki nigbagbogbo.
I can’t wait to count them as my daughter.	Emi ko le duro lati ka wọn si ọmọbirin mi.
It just is.	O kan jẹ.
Will you be able to answer my question?	Ṣe iwọ yoo ni anfani lati gba ibeere mi?
He is here to stop me.	O wa nibi lati da mi duro.
We saw it last week.	A rii ni ọsẹ to kọja.
It will stay for another two days.	O yoo duro fun ọjọ meji miiran.
They have to go home.	Wọn ni lati lọ si ile.
An easy way to understand this is with a door.	Ọna ti o rọrun lati ni oye eyi jẹ pẹlu ilẹkun kan.
This was just too.	Eleyi je o kan ju.
Everyone does, most of the time.	Gbogbo eniyan ni o ṣe, ni ọpọlọpọ igba.
He was obviously looking for me.	O han gbangba pe o n wa mi.
Going home now is not possible.	Lilọ si ile ni bayi ko ṣee ṣe.
This has long been known.	Eleyi ti gun a ti mọ.
It all started.	O bẹrẹ gbogbo eyi.
Here is one way to do it.	Eyi ni ọna kan lati ṣe.
As a man they began to live.	Bi ọkunrin kan wọn bẹrẹ lati gbe.
I am having a hard time with it.	Mo n ni akoko lile pẹlu rẹ.
It takes three of them to do the work of one person.	O gba mẹta ninu wọn lati ṣe iṣẹ ti eniyan kan.
It is hateful enough for that to happen.	O ti wa ni korira to fun awọn ti o lati ṣẹlẹ.
And do not expect it to be easy.	Ati pe maṣe nireti pe yoo rọrun.
You love this boat.	O nifẹ ọkọ oju omi yii.
But there it is.	Ṣugbọn nibẹ ni o ni.
This is for space reasons.	Eyi jẹ fun awọn idi ti aaye.
That will take about an hour, with all lost.	Iyẹn yoo gba to wakati kan, pẹlu gbogbo nu.
You need life.	O nilo igbesi aye.
A mountain rose behind the city.	Oke nla kan dide lẹhin ilu.
Maybe it's not so bad.	Boya o ni ko ki buburu.
Don't expect too much.	Maṣe reti pupọ.
For your people.	Fun awon eniyan re.
Wait, that's not right.	Duro, iyẹn ko tọ.
Change a little more this way.	Yipada diẹ diẹ sii ni ọna yii.
It has been associated with this group for many years.	O ti ni nkan ṣe pẹlu ẹgbẹ yii fun ọpọlọpọ ọdun.
It has an amazing story to tell.	O ni itan iyalẹnu lati sọ.
You will not be angry.	Iwọ ko ni binu.
There is nothing to do.	Ko si nkankan lati ṣe.
Don’t get out on me.	Maṣe gba jade lori mi.
He has been working in his field for many years.	O ti n ṣiṣẹ ni aaye rẹ fun ọdun pupọ.
There is a restaurant nearby.	Ile ounjẹ kan wa nitosi.
I have no idea how to change.	Emi ko ni imọran bi mo ṣe le yipada.
However, this did not happen.	Sibẹsibẹ, eyi ko ṣe.
Did not find it.	Ko ri i.
We know this is not your job.	A mọ pe eyi kii ṣe iṣẹ rẹ.
That is hard in itself.	Iyẹn jẹ lile ninu ara rẹ.
I put water in your room.	Mo fi omi sinu yara rẹ.
Sure it went all or nothing.	O daju pe o lọ gbogbo tabi ohunkohun.
Some of us are.	Diẹ ninu wa ni.
I'm just being strong.	Mo kan wa ni okun.
That's not it.	Kii ṣe iyẹn.
This is the most difficult question.	Eyi ni ibeere ti o nira julọ.
Could not find.	Ko ti le ri.
He was more than a mountain man.	O jẹ diẹ sii ju ọkunrin oke kan lọ.
Both brother and sister and husband and wife.	Mejeeji arakunrin ati arabinrin ati ọkunrin ati iyawo.
Your song is over.	Orin rẹ pari.
But he did not.	Ṣugbọn ko ṣe.
But he hesitated for a minute.	Ṣugbọn o ṣiyemeji fun iṣẹju kan.
Change if desired.	Yi pada ti o ba fẹ.
He ate well, but said little.	O jẹun daradara, ṣugbọn o sọ diẹ.
I know people who like that.	Mo mọ awọn eniyan ti o fẹ iyẹn.
Stand up and keep your head up.	Duro jẹ ki ori rẹ gbe ga.
That is my advice.	Iyẹn ni imọran mi.
Or a small tree.	Tabi igi kekere kan.
She feared his love for her.	O bẹru ifẹ rẹ fun u.
We need more ideas.	A nilo diẹ ero.
It also looks great.	O tun dabi nla.
That’s as convincing as it can be.	Iyẹn ni idaniloju bi idaniloju le jẹ.
There is a town nearby.	Ilu kan wa nitosi ibi.
But you can not express yourself.	Ṣugbọn o ko le fi ara rẹ han.
He remembered where he was.	O ranti ibi ti o wa.
I want to make sure you understand.	Mo fẹ lati rii daju pe o loye.
Can anyone help please ???.	Ṣe ẹnikẹni le ṣe iranlọwọ jọwọ???.
But it seems to be true.	Ṣugbọn o dabi pe o jẹ otitọ.
With it, it is personal.	Pẹlu rẹ, o jẹ ti ara ẹni.
I know you know.	Mo mọ pe o mọ.
Good buy two.	Dara ra meji.
I can put my hands on the fire.	Mo le fi ọwọ mi sinu ina.
I need to hear.	Mo nilo lati gbọ.
I haven't tried to get out yet.	Emi ko gbiyanju lati jade sibẹsibẹ.
Neither of these things is true.	Bẹni ninu nkan wọnyi jẹ otitọ.
You are very familiar with these old words.	O mọ pupọ pẹlu awọn ọrọ atijọ wọnyi.
You will know when you find something worthwhile.	Iwọ yoo mọ nigbati o rii nkan ti o tọ.
You do not know if that is true or not.	O ko mọ boya iyẹn tun jẹ otitọ tabi rara.
That day is over.	Ọjọ yẹn ti lọ.
The school is a big house.	Ile-iwe naa jẹ ile nla kan.
It seems possible.	O dabi ẹni pe o ṣeeṣe.
But not good.	Sugbon ko dara.
With respect to.	Pẹlu ọwọ si.
In a minute he came back.	Ni iṣẹju kan o tun pada wa.
Not just now.	Ko kan bayi.
I do not believe any of it.	Emi ko gbagbọ eyikeyi ninu rẹ.
When everyone is gone, the game is just around the corner.	Nigbati gbogbo eniyan ti lọ, ere naa wa nikan.
Tell your friends.	Sọ fun awọn ọrẹ rẹ.
And where did that song come from?	Ati nibo ni orin yẹn ti wa?
It does not change the appropriate value.	Ko yi iye ti o yẹ pada.
It has been.	O ti wa.
Everyone knows what to do.	Gbogbo eniyan mọ kini lati ṣe.
Have done the test work.	Ti ṣe iṣẹ idanwo naa.
I spend all morning at work.	Mo lo gbogbo owurọ ni iṣẹ.
Only very convincing.	Nikan ni idaniloju pupọ.
But let’s work on it.	Ṣugbọn jẹ ki a ṣiṣẹ lọwọ.
You may have two in your face sometimes.	O le ni meji ni oju rẹ nigba miiran.
But this is not something that really caught my attention.	Ṣugbọn eyi kii ṣe ohun ti o gba akiyesi mi gaan.
It is not who does what but when and how often.	Kii ṣe ẹniti o ṣe kini ṣugbọn nigbawo ati igba melo.
He also did not notice the police car.	O tun ko ṣe akiyesi ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ ọlọpa.
I know, life can be hard for you.	Mo mọ, igbesi aye le pupọ fun ọ.
I will go and see him.	Emi yoo lọ lati ri i.
But days passed, and the doctor did not return.	Ṣugbọn awọn ọjọ kọja, dokita ko pada.
I can still enjoy my future now.	Mo tun le gbadun ọjọ iwaju mi ​​bayi.
This place is home.	Ibi yi ni ile.
He has lived at home with her since the day he bought her.	O ti gbe ni ile pẹlu rẹ lati ọjọ ti o ra.
She loves to go down there on her vacation.	O nifẹ lati lọ silẹ nibẹ ni isinmi rẹ.
Now there is a story.	Bayi itan kan wa.
Now you do not have to ask.	Bayi ko ni lati beere.
I did nothing and you are not.	Emi ko ṣe ohunkohun ati pe iwọ kii ṣe.
Okay, it should be.	O dara, o yẹ ki o jẹ.
He is holding something in his hand.	O n di nkan mu lọwọ rẹ.
You need this.	O nilo eyi.
They don’t look like anything.	Wọn ko dabi ohunkohun.
It would have been much easier.	Yoo ti rọrun pupọ.
Maybe it will.	Boya yoo to.
I can see a lot that is hard to believe.	Mo le rii pupọ pe o nira lati gbagbọ.
We lost our families and we had no money.	A padanu awọn idile wa ati pe a ko ni owo.
They gave us a room.	Wọn ti fun wa ni yara kan.
He stopped for a minute.	O duro ni iṣẹju kan.
He added another space for his meeting.	O fi aaye miiran kun fun ipade rẹ.
No games off.	Ko si awọn ere pa.
The group hopes to reach an agreement.	Ẹgbẹ naa nireti lati ṣe adehun adehun kan.
Now back to back.	Bayi pada sẹhin.
He did not die down.	Ko ku si isalẹ.
The plane had to return.	Ọkọ ofurufu ni lati pada.
Just try to understand how.	O kan gbiyanju lati ni oye bi.
He promised that we would leave this place.	O ṣe ileri pe a yoo lọ kuro ni ibi yii.
This is a wonderful day.	Eyi jẹ ọjọ iyanu.
We hope to have you with us.	A nireti lati ni ọ pẹlu wa.
He often visited the city.	Nigbagbogbo o ṣabẹwo si ilu naa.
We are working on this project together.	A n ṣiṣẹ lori iṣẹ yii papọ.
We felt really good.	A ti ro gan ti o dara.
This is especially true when it should be well known.	Eyi jẹ otitọ paapaa nigbati o yẹ ki o mọ daradara.
This takes a lot of time.	Eyi gba akoko pupọ julọ.
This should be a service for the people living there.	Eyi yẹ ki o wa ni iṣẹ fun awọn eniyan ti o ngbe nibẹ.
She is worried.	O ti ni aniyan.
Many of you will have seen it.	Ọpọlọpọ awọn ti o yoo ti ri o.
I went out of my room and saw it.	Mo jade ninu yara mi, mo si ri e.
It killed a lot of people, in fact.	O pa ọpọlọpọ eniyan, ni otitọ.
Some of us are serious.	Diẹ ninu wa jẹ pataki.
The decision may be final.	Ipinnu le jẹ ipari.
Most of it is good.	Pupọ ninu rẹ dara.
It is also important!	O tun ṣe pataki!
Some will be good, some will be bad.	Diẹ ninu yoo dara, diẹ ninu yoo jẹ buburu.
Most of them do.	Pupọ ninu wọn ṣe.
I know you will enjoy this verse the most.	Mo mọ pe iwọ yoo gbadun ẹsẹ yii julọ.
He believes in that future.	O gbagbọ ni ọjọ iwaju yẹn.
The man had done it for a reason.	Ọkunrin naa ti ṣe fun idi kan.
There are many cars around the city.	Awọn ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ pupọ lo wa ni ayika ilu naa.
He said it went well.	O sọ pe o lọ daradara.
I’ll take you with me, mostly.	Emi yoo mu ọ pẹlu mi, julọ.
It goes with everything.	O n lọ pẹlu ohun gbogbo.
No, that is not the case.	Rara, kii ṣe iyẹn.
And we did not stay on the phone for long.	Ati pe a ko duro lori foonu fun igba pipẹ.
But who needs it.	Ṣugbọn tani nilo rẹ.
The problem is huge here in the city.	Iṣoro naa jẹ nla nibi ni ilu.
I really don't like this observation.	Emi ko fẹ akiyesi yii gaan.
The men had been picked up in a car.	Awọn ọkunrin ti a ti gbe ninu ọkọ ayọkẹlẹ kan.
I do not walk there.	Emi ko rin nibẹ.
Will always be less than required.	Yoo nigbagbogbo kere ju ti a beere lọ.
It should be a set of rules only.	O yẹ ki o jẹ eto awọn ofin kan nikan.
It has already been like them.	O ti dabi wọn tẹlẹ.
Sorry for trying to be around.	Ma binu fun u gbiyanju lati wa ni ayika.
Just try to get out.	O kan gbiyanju lati jade.
When you go.	Nigbati o lọ.
No questions about it.	Ko si ibeere nipa rẹ.
But we will see how it goes for them if they try.	Ṣugbọn a yoo rii bi o ṣe lọ fun wọn ti wọn ba gbiyanju.
This is important.	Eyi ṣe pataki.
The boat is in the sea.	Ọkọ naa wa ni okun.
I know you keep up with the news.	Mo mọ pe o tẹsiwaju pẹlu awọn iroyin.
You don’t have any money on it.	O ko ni eyikeyi owo lori rẹ.
You can not block your way.	O ko le di ọna rẹ.
And they might just end tonight.	Ati pe wọn kan le pari ni alẹ oni.
Stay with them.	Duro pẹlu wọn.
It looks the same as last season.	O jẹ oju kanna bi akoko ikẹhin.
It sounds hard, but it is not.	O dabi lile, ṣugbọn kii ṣe.
